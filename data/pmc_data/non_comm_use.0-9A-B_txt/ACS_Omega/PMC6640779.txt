We benchmark various quantum chemical
methods for calculating the
optical absorption in planar boron wheel clusters. The geometries
of neutral planar boron wheels B7, B8, and B9 clusters are optimized at the coupled-cluster singles doubles
level of theory. The optical absorption spectra of these clusters
are calculated using three wave-function-based methods, namely, configuration
interaction singles, random phase approximation, and equation-of-motion
coupled-cluster singles doubles (EOM-CCSD) as well as using a time-dependent
density-functional-theory-based method using various hybrid and long-range-corrected
exchange and correlation functionals. There is an ample variation
in the optical absorption spectra computed using different density
functionals. When compared to the EOM-CCSD spectrum, an excellent
agreement is provided by CAM-B3LYP functional, followed by ωB97xD
functional. PBE0, B3LYP, and B3PW91 functionals agree among each other.
However, their spectra are red-shifted with respect to the EOM-CCSD
counterpart. On the basis of the natural transition orbital analysis,
the nature of optical excitation is also discussed.

1 Introduction
Clusters
of atoms exhibit novel structures and properties, providing
insights into new stoichiometries and chemical bondings. Planar boron
clusters, in particular, have proven to be interesting because of
the multiple aromaticities and extreme coordination environments.1−5 Atoms of boron can adopt such an arrangement that they form a miniature
wheel, with one atom at the center. B13+ and
B13– perform Wankel motor action when
shined by circularly polarized light.6−8 Such clusters have been
synthesized, and their electronic structure is now well known.1 Boron with seven, eight, and nine atoms forms
such truly planar wheel structures with radii of 1.65, 1.80, and 2.0
Å, respectively. Although a lot of information about planarity,
electronic structure, and chemical bonding is now available, the optical
absorption of these clusters remains unexplored. Study of optical
properties of such materials helps exploring applications in nanoplasmonics,
photovoltaics, and so forth. Several methods exist for the calculation
of optical absorption in these clusters. We present here benchmarking
of various quantum chemical methods to get highly accurate results
with relatively less computation.

To describe the ground state
of a system, normally a reference
state is used, which is a good approximation to the exact ground state
of the system. Typically, variationally optimal solutions are recommended,
although this is not the only possible way. This reference state cannot
be a natural choice when it comes to electronic excited states. The
variational collapse of optimization becomes preventive under such
circumstances. Coupled-cluster methods offer insensitivity to such
single reference owing to the exponential treatment of single excitation
effects.9

Equation-of-motion-coupled
cluster is one of the approaches that
can effectively and unambiguously describe the excited states of molecules
or polyradicals where ground or excited states are often degenerate.
Because it does not make any assumptions about the nature of the states,
it is an easy-to-use single reference method. Also, it is the most
accurate method in calculating one-electron vertical transition states.
Often, the cluster expansion is terminated at doubles for computational
feasibility, without serious compromise on the quality of results.
The results can always be systematically improved by including more
excitation levels. However, this method scales as N6, N being the number of basis functions,
thereby making it intractable for large molecules.

We give here
an account of other less expensive quantum chemical
methods that can approximate the accurate equation-of-motion coupled-cluster
singles doubles (EOM-CCSD) results. Only single-reference methods
have been used to enable even nonspecialists for straightforward use
with meaningful insights. In particular, the time-dependent density
functional theory (TDDFT) with adiabatic approximation continues to
remain favorite for the study of a large variety of systems. The exact
exchange and correlation functionals required in this approach are
not known; several approximations have been made in that respect.
This adds to the puzzle to choose the right functional for a given
type of calculation.10−13 This work provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of benchmarking
results of various single reference quantum chemical methods including
different functionals for TDDFT. This study helps in computationally
identifying the least expensive method/functional that mimics more
accurate EOM-CCSD results of optical absorption. This work was inspired
by similar studies of comparison of oscillator strengths and electronic
transition energies of different sets of small organic molecules.14,15 Caricato, Trucks, Frisch, and Wiberg found that for vertical transition
energies the best average performance is obtained with the B3P86 functional
having a small amount of Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange.14 Whereas for oscillator strengths, the CAM-B3LYP
functional gave results close to the reference one.15 Because clusters studied in the present work are planar
inorganic molecules with open shells, it would be useful to benchmark
the quantum chemical methods for their optical absorption. This study
is based on a self-authored thesis chapter.16

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Next section
discusses the theoretical and computational details of the calculations.
Results are presented and discussed in the section Results and Discussion. Conclusions and future directions
are presented in the section Conclusions and Outlook. Detailed information about wave functions of excited states contributing
to various photoabsorption peaks is given in Supporting Information.

2 Theoretical and Computational
Details
2.1 Geometry Optimization
The geometries
of the boron wheel clusters were optimized using the computer code
GAUSSIAN 0917 using a 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis
set and using the size-consistent coupled-cluster singles doubles
(CCSD) method. Raw geometries based on the density functional method
were used to initiate the optimization as reported by Wang and co-workers.1 The results of the optimization are in accordance
with the available reports. These optimized geometries were further
used in the calculations of optical absorption spectra. Figure 1 shows the final optimized
geometries of the clusters studied in this paper.

Figure 1 Geometry optimized structures
of boron wheels (a) B7, (b) B8, and (c) B9 with point group symmetry
and electronic ground state. All numbers are in angstrom units.

The optical absorption spectra
of these optimized geometries of
the clusters are then calculated using various quantum chemical methods
such as configuration interaction singles (CIS), EOM-CCSD, and TDDFT
using the computer code GAUSSIAN 09.17 Various
exchange and correlation functionals were used to compute the optical
absorption spectra using the TDDFT approach. An augmented, correlation
consistent, polarized valence double zeta basis set was used for all
methods mentioned above. This basis set is well suited for optical
absorption calculations.18,19

2.1.1 Excited-State
Calculation Methods
The excited-state energies of clusters
are obtained using the simplest
wave-function-based ab initio CIS approach. In this method, different
configurations are constructed by promoting an electron from an occupied
orbital to a virtual orbital. Excited states of the system will have
a linear combination of all such substituted configurations, with
corresponding variational coefficients. For open-shell systems, we
have used unrestricted HF formalism for constructing CIS configurations.
The energies of the excited states will then be obtained by diagonalizing
the Hamiltonian in this configurational space.17 The dipole matrix elements are calculated using the ground-state
and excited-state wave functions. This is subsequently used for calculating
the optical absorption cross section assuming a Lorentzian lineshape,
with some artificial finite linewidth.

Because the CIS method
does not include electron correlation, as single excitation does not
mix with HF reference, it is improved by including perturbative doubles
correction. This is known as CIS(D). If it includes selective doubles
excitation, then it gives rise to what is known as random phase approximation
(RPA).

Coupled cluster method is known to include electron correlation
in a systematic manner. Coupled cluster is an exact formalism if all
possible excitations are taken into account. The excitation level
is often terminated at doubles, which gives rise to the CCSD method.
This method is extended to excited-state calculations through what
is known as EOM-CCSD.20,21 The computational time for this
approach scales as N6, where N is the number of basis functions, thereby limiting its use to smaller
molecules.

2.1.2 TDDFT Calculations
Development
of density functional theory (DFT) has led to an enormous progress
in the understanding of properties of various systems. However, the
main drawback is its dependence on the choice of exchange–correlation
(XC) functional. Many different functionals are proposed for various
kinds of calculations and the number is still counting. The time-dependent
counterpart of DFT also uses the same functionals to investigate the
excited-state properties. Here, we have considered various standard
DFT XC functionals of various types to study the excited-state properties
and optical absorption in boron clusters. The set of functionals includes
(a) hybrid generalized-gradient approximation (H-GGA)—B3LYP,22−25 B3PW91,22,26 and PBE0,27−30 (b) global hybrid-meta GGA (HM-GGA)—M0631 and M06-2X,31 and
(c) long-range corrected—ωB97xD,32 CAM-B3LYP,33 and LC-ωPBE.34−37

A local or semilocal density functional approximation to the
XC functional often leads to a self-interaction error. Also, the XC
potential has incorrect long-range behavior. In molecules, the XC
potential of semilocal functionals decay exponentially as compared
to the −1/r⃗ form of exact asymptotic
behavior of the XC potential.36 Also, systems
with an odd number of electrons, open-shell systems, or delocalized
electrons are poorly described by local or semilocal density functional
approximations. These issues can be resolved by mixing a certain amount
of HF exchange into the DFT exchange and correlation functionals.
With this resolution, the XC potential decays as −a/r⃗ where a is the fraction
of HF exchange mixture. Also, the exchange component of DFT can be
split into two parts: (a) short range and (b) long range. A 100% HF
exchange is used in the long-range limit to compensate part of the
self-interaction error of DFT because HF exchange leads to an effective
potential that has the correct asymptotic behavior.38 Such a long-range-corrected class of functionals with an
empirical separation parameter will be useful in describing molecules
with delocalized electrons.34−36

The percentage of HF exchange
in the XC functionals B3LYP, B3PW91,
and PBE0 is 20%, 20%, and 25%, respectively. For Minnesota functionals
M06 and M06-2X, HF exchange contributes 27% and 54%, respectively.
The range-separated functionals have HF contribution depending upon
the interelectronic distances. For example, in CAM-B3LYP, 19% HF exchange
contributes in the short-range, whereas 65% HF exchange contributes
in the long-range. The functional ωB97xD with empirical dispersion
has 22% and 100% exact exchange for short- and long-range, respectively.
The performance of each of the above-mentioned functionals and other
wave-function-based methods is discussed in the next section.

3 Results and Discussion
In this section, we
present vertical excitation energies for each
cluster studied for different excited-state calculation methods, followed
by the description of the photoabsorption spectra of boron wheel clusters
studied. Graphical presentation of natural transition orbitals involved
in TDDFT calculations is also given below.

3.1 Vertical
Excitation Energies
Vertical
excitation energies of first few excited states for each cluster are
calculated. These values are reported separately in the Supporting Information. To get a comparative
insight, we have taken the differences in vertical excitation energies
of first four excited states for each method from the corresponding
values of the EOM-CCSD reference. In the case of B8 cluster,
the number of states considered is six because some of the states
are degenerate. Figures 2–4 show the graphical
presentation of these results for B7, B8, and
B9 clusters, respectively.

Figure 2 Vertical excitation energy differences
ΔΕυe = ΕυeQCM – ΕυeEOM for the first four excited states
of the B7 cluster.

Figure 3 Vertical excitation energy differences ΔΕυe = ΕυeQCM – ΕυeEOM for the first six excited states of the B8 cluster.

Figure 4 Vertical excitation energy differences ΔΕυe = ΕυeQCM – ΕυeEOM for the first four excited states of
the B9 cluster.

In the case of B7 cluster, the wave-function-based
methods
perform poorly because the deviation is too large from the reference.
B3LYP, B3PW91, PBE0, and M06-2X provide red-shifted results compared
to EOM-CCSD. A good compromise is made by CAM-B3LYP, M06, and ωB97xD
functionals because the deviation from reference is the least. PBE0
outperforms all other methods in the vertical energy calculations
for the B8 cluster. CIS consistently overestimates the Eυe and so does RPA. Rest of the methods
are within a fraction of an eV from the reference EOM-CCSD calculations.
CIS and RPA provide contrary results in the case of B9 clusters.
All DFT functionals studied here provide roughly the same red-shifted
deviation from the reference results in this case.

The comparison
of absorption peak positions with the largest oscillator
strengths obtained using various quantum chemical methods to the EOM-CCSD
reference (see Table S4) is graphically
shown in Figures 5 and 6. We have included cases of only B8 and
B9 because their spectra contain well-defined intense peaks.
In this study, a good performer will have ΔE value as close to zero as possible. It is clearly seen that the
wave-function-based methods largely overestimate the peak positions
in the optical absorption spectra. On the other hand, CAM-B3LYP and
ωB97xD perform excellently on par with the reference EOM-CCSD
calculations. Other hybrid-GGA functionals underestimate the energies
of intense peaks in the absorption spectrum, whereas the long-range-corrected
functional LC-ωPBE0 overestimates the energies.

Figure 5 Difference in the peak
energies corresponding to the largest oscillator
strength ΔE = EQCM – EEOM compared with the EOM-CCSD
spectrum of B8.

Figure 6 Difference in the peak energies corresponding to the largest oscillator
strength ΔE = EQCM – EEOM compared with the EOM-CCSD
spectrum of B9.

3.2 Calculated Photoabsorption Spectra of Various
Clusters
As evident in Figure 7, CIS largely overestimates the excitation energies
in the optical absorption spectra of B7 as compared to
the reference EOM-CCSD spectra. RPA shows similar behavior but has
smaller blue shifts as compared to CIS. Both CIS and RPA show higher
intensities in all energy bands than the reference one. An excellent
agreement is observed between EOM-CCSD and TDDFT results (see Figure 8) with ωB97xD
and CAM-B3LYP functionals. This agreement holds good on the grounds
of both excitation energies and oscillator strengths. However, ωB97xD
deviates from CAM-B3LYP spectra after 7 eV. M06 and M06-2X functionals
show consistently red-shifted absorption throughout the spectrum.
Other functionals, such as PBE0 and B3PW91, almost overlap each other
in the low-energy regime. However, the former shifts toward blue from
B3PW91 at higher energies. NTO analysis (see Figure 9) reveals that the nature of excitation for
the peak at 1.63 eV is π → π*, and at 5.72 eV,
σ → σ* dominates the excitation.

Figure 7 Linear optical absorption
spectrum of the boron wheel B7 cluster calculated using
EOM-CCSD, CIS, and RPA approaches. For
plotting the spectrum, a uniform linewidth of 0.01 eV was used.

Figure 8 Linear optical absorption spectrum of the boron
wheel B7 cluster calculated using the TDDFT approach using
various functionals
and compared to EOM-CCSD. For plotting the spectrum, a uniform linewidth
of 0.01 eV was used.

Figure 9 Natural transition orbitals (NTO) involved in the excited states
of the B7 cluster calculated using the PBE0 method corresponding
to the peak (a) at 1.63 eV with λ = 0.56 (Hα – 1 → Lα) and to the peak (b) at
5.72 eV with λ = 0.35 (H1α → Lα + 4). The parameter λ refers to a fraction of the NTO pair
contribution to a given electronic excitation.

The optical absorption spectrum of B8 (Figures 10 and 11) shows very few and well-separated peaks. When
compared with the
EOM-CCSD spectrum, CIS and RPA show a large overestimation of excitation
energies. Again, CAM-B3LYP and ωB97xD give an excellent agreement
on the absorption spectrum when compared to the EOM-CCSD counterpart.
At the strongest absorption peak, both energies and intensities of
the spectra of these functionals match very well with each other in
this case. M06 exhibits poor performance, with bands shifted to lower
energies. Also, there are extra peaks observed at higher energies
for this functional. M06-2X seems to correct the latter behavior while
retaining the red shift of bands. PBE0, B3LYP, and B3PW91 spectra
agree with each other at lower energies but start deviating afterward.
The long-range-corrected functional LC-ωPBE has the same intensity
profile as that of EOM-CCSD, but the peaks are generally blue-shifted
by 0.2–0.4 eV. A pair of σ → π* transitions
takes place at 1.77 eV, as seen from the NTO analysis in Figure 12.

Figure 10 Linear optical absorption

CIS, EOM-CCSD, and RPA approaches. For
plotting the spectrum, a uniform linewidth of 0.01 eV was used.

Figure 11 Linear optical absorption spectrum of
the boron wheel B8 cluster calculated using the TDDFT approach
using various functionals
and compared to EOM-CCSD. For plotting the spectrum, a uniform linewidth
of 0.01 eV was used.

Figure 12 NTO involved in the excited states of the B8 cluster
calculated using the PBE0 method corresponding to the peak (a) at
1.77 eV with λ = 0.99 (Hβ – 1 →
H1β and Hβ – 2 → H2β) and to the peak at 6.28 eV (b) with λ = 0.11
(Hα – 2 → Lα + 3),
(c) 0.25 (Hα – 1 → Lα + 2), (d) 0.29 (Hβ – 2 → Lβ + 1), and (e) 0.29 (Hβ – 1 → Lβ). The parameter λ refers to a fraction of the
NTO pair contribution to a given electronic excitation.

The optical absorption spectrum of B9 also has very
few intense peaks. Almost negligible absorption is seen at lower energies.
As seen in Figure 13, the blue-shifted spectra of CIS and RPA show a large overestimation
of the intensity. On the contrary, PBE0, B3LYP, B3PW91, M06, and M06-2X
underestimate the position of the energy bands (see Figure 14). The spectrum of B9 is extremely overestimated by LC-ωPBE both in the position
and in the intensities of bands. CAM-B3LYP and ωB97xD again
provide an excellent agreement on intensities and positions of energy
bands. The peak at 1.71 eV is dominated by σ → σ*,
and at 6.15 eV, σ → σ* transition takes place,
as evident from the NTO analysis shown in Figure 15.

Figure 13 Linear optical absorption spectrum of the boron
wheel B9 cluster calculated using CIS, EOM-CCSD, and RPA
approaches. For
plotting the spectrum, a uniform linewidth of 0.01 eV was used.

Figure 14 Linear optical absorption spectrum of
the boron wheel B9 cluster calculated using the TDDFT approach
using various functionals
and compared to EOM-CCSD. For plotting the spectrum, a uniform linewidth
of 0.01 eV was used.

Figure 15 NTO involved in the excited states of the B9 cluster
calculated using the PBE0 method corresponding to the peak (a) at
1.71 eV with λ = 0.99 (Hβ – 3 →
H1β), (b) at 6.15 eV with λ = 0.25 (Hβ – 3 → Lβ + 1) and (c) λ = 0.32
(Hβ – 2 → Lβ). The
parameter λ refers to a fraction of the NTO pair contribution
to a given electronic excitation.

The CIS method, in general, overestimates the excitation
energies
because it does not include electron correlation effects. RPA with
perturbative doubles slightly improves the excitation energies for
all three clusters. This means that sophisticated electron-correlated
methods, such as multireference configuration interaction method,
can perform better because of systematic inclusion of electron correlation
energies.18,19 Hybrid-GGA functionals with the same amount
of HF exchange contribution (i.e., B3PW91 and B3LYP) have almost overlapping
optical absorption spectra and differ slightly compared with the PBE0
spectrum that has 25% HF exchange. This indicates that a self-interaction
correction is necessary (in terms of inclusion of HF exchange). Minnesota
functionals have a larger share of HF exchanges but their spectra
are red-shifted. These functionals were originally optimized for thermochemistry
and reaction kinetics; so, they may not perform well for electronic
excitation calculations.38 Range-corrected
functionals perform better for optical absorption in planar boron
wheel clusters as compared to the hybrid or metahybrid functionals
because of extended nature of orbitals, where incorporation of HF
exchange at different interelectronic distances helps in describing
the correct asymptotic behavior. This is why spectra of CAM-B3LYP
and ωB97xD match very well with the EOM-CCSD spectrum. However,
the spectrum of LC-ωPBE differs from the rest of the range-corrected
functionals, especially at higher energies. This failure of the XC
functional with the correct asymptotic behavior can be due to inaccurate
transition dipoles between the valence states where only functionals
with lower HF exchange perform well.39

The nature of optical excitation can be classified into molecular-type
or collective/plasmonic-type depending upon the extent of mixing of
configurations to many-body wave functions of excited states contributing
to a particular peak. A strong mixing of configurations to the many-body
wave functions of excited states suggests a collective or plasmonic
excitation. On the other hand, a single dominant configuration contributing
to the excited state suggests a molecular type of excitation.40,41 The analysis of configurations contributing to EOM-CCSD many-body
wave functions (see Supporting Information) of various excited states contributing to peaks of absorption spectra
of these boron wheel clusters suggests that these excitations are
of the collective plasmonic type. This fact is also confirmed in the
NTO analysis of excited states, where several fractions (λ)
of the NTO pair contribution to a given electronic excitation have
comparable weights.

4 Conclusions and Outlook
The goal of the present study was to benchmark various single reference
quantum chemical methods for calculating optical absorption spectra
of planar boron wheel clusters. We sampled three wave-function-based
methods and TDDFT with eight different XC functionals. Wave-function-based
methods, such as RPA and CIS, consistently overestimate the excitation
energies and oscillator strengths as compared to the EOM-CCSD calculations.
The statistical analysis also reveals that the strongest peak positions
are quite scattered from EOM reference values. To improve the situation,
one should consider multireference methods because the test clusters
have open-shell ground states.

Hybrid-GGA functionals—PBE0,
B3LYP, and B3PW91—are
also poor performers because they tend to underestimate the excitation
energies. M06 and M06-2X are not indifferent in above-mentioned analysis.
Among the long-range-corrected functionals, CAM-B3LYP provides the
best agreement with EOM results both on the basis of oscillator strengths
and excitation energies.

Although this study neither
includes all functionals available nor are the test cases comprehensive,
it helps in providing a reasonable comparison between various single
reference methods and identifying the functionals that provide as
good a result as EOM-CCSD in light of optical absorption calculations.
These findings can be tested against more sophisticated multireference
calculations.18,19
