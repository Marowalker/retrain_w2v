We use time-resolved thermal lens (TL) experiments to
examine the convective heat transfer at microscale in the first eight
members of the homologous series of primary alcohols. TL measurements
enable a direct study of these primary alcohols without adding any
chromophore as a function of varying heat loads created via femtosecond
laser pulses at 1560 nm. Convective heat transfer leads to the asymmetrical
and reduced thermal gradient, which substantially weakens the TL signal.
The inflection in the time profile of the TL signal of methanol at
higher powers is attributed to the greater molecular convection in
methanol compared to other samples. This inflection dies out with
a decrease in laser power. Our results demonstrate that the convection
is more prominent at higher laser powers in all samples, and it modifies
the trend in the steady-state TL signal of different alcohols with
pump laser power. Methanol also has the highest steady-state TL among
the primary alcohol series at low laser powers. The maxima in the
TL signal are shifted systematically from methanol to ethanol and
then to propanol as the laser power increases. Semiempirical analysis
of time-resolved TL signal by using the latest theoretical TL model
enabled us to extract the coefficient of convective heat transfer
in methanol at different laser powers. In addition to that, analysis
of other members of alcohol series at the highest (7.3 mW) laser power
shows that convection is more facile in short-chain alcohols compared
to the long-chain alcohols.

1 Introduction
Alcohols are extensively
used in chemical, pharmaceutical, medical, and industrial sectors
depending on their physical and chemical properties. Therefore, the
study of the chemical and physical properties of alcohols has always
been an active area of research. Alcohols, water, and their binary
mixtures also play a crucial role as heat transfer fluids in different
industrial subdivisions, such as chemical and power plants, refrigeration
and air-conditioning units, transportation, and microelectronics.
With the aim of device miniaturization and process intensification
at industrial scale, performance improvement of heat transfer fluids
has been an objective of various investigations for a long time. Heat
removal methodology in numerous engineering disciplines, such as cooling
of electronic devices, relies on heat transfer by natural convection
due to its simplicity and reliability.

Convection is the transfer
of heat by collective motion of fluid driven by buoyancy force and/or
external forces. The convection led by buoyancy forces is called natural
convection, i.e., denser fluids sink while lighter fluids rise. Natural
convection has been studied extensively due to its presence in various
phenomena in nature. Convective heat transfer is more difficult to
characterize than conduction because not a single intrinsic property
of the material, like thermal conductivity for conduction, can be
defined to scale the process. Both thermal properties of fluids and
hydrodynamic characteristics of flow govern heat dissipation by convection.
In practice, convective heat transfer is often analyzed empirically
(by experimental measurement). Lasers can achieve contactless regulated
local heating with controlled intensity and beam profile. Natural
convection induced that way can be investigated using the thermal
lens (TL) technique. This technique relies on the measurement of the
refractive index gradient build up in the samples. When an absorbing
sample is irradiated with a laser, constituent molecules get excited
to higher-energy states. Nonradiative relaxation of these molecules
back to the ground states produces heat in the medium.

Consequently,
the temperature of the irradiated spot becomes higher than that of
its surrounding. Since refractive index of a medium changes with temperature,
a refractive index gradient is also formed in the sample. Thus, the
sample acts like a lens, which is called the thermal lens. It can
be probed by monitoring the alteration of the wavefront of the light
beam passing through it. Thermal lens effect was first observed by
Gordon et al., who used a single laser beam for both pump and probe
purposes.1,2 Over the years, thermal lens spectroscopy
has emerged as a highly sensitive tool to study photochemical reactions,3−5 thermo-optical properties,6−9 quantum
yield,10−12 low absorbance,13 trace analysis,14 nonlinear optical properties,15 and thermophoresis.16−18 Since the first observation of
the thermal lens effect, many different experimental configurations
and theoretical models19−23 have been developed
to improve the sensitivity of TL apparatus and the analysis of the
experimental signal. Unfortunately, these models are valid only for
small phase change of the probe beam and only for the conductive mode
of heat transfer. Only a few reports in the literature address the
effects of natural convection on thermal lens signal.24−27 Recently,
our group has shown the influence of molecular size and structure
on convective heat transfer.28,29 In so doing, we showed
the effect of molecular size on convection by changing the chain length
of primary aliphatic alcohols and the effect of molecular structure
on convection by taking different structural isomers of the butanol.
Convection has also been exploited in a variety of experiments in
the last few decades,30−40 for instance, for the guided motion of an
oil droplet on the surface of water using a laser beam39 and for DNA trapping and DNA stretching. Other
than the above biophysical applications, convection has also been
utilized for tailoring and manipulating two-dimensional colloidal
crystals.30,31 Besides these diverse applications of convective
flow induced in the system via laser heating, convective heat transfer
needs to be explored as a function of laser parameters.

In our
previous report,28 a new semiempirical
TL model was proposed and tested on a homologous series of primary
alcohols at one particular laser power where molecular size was the
major factor in the systematic study of convective heat transfer.
The low thermal conductivity of alcohols makes them a suitable candidate
for the thermal lens study.41,42 However, as the heat
load changes at different laser powers, the heat transfer process
can be different—a possibility that was not explored in our
previous work. In the present study, the rate of heat generation has
been investigated as the key factor in the systematic study of convective
heat transfer. Thus, this study explores an important missing parameter
from our last study and is not an extension of our previous work.
It is an exploration that builds on the understanding gained from
the previous work.28 In keeping with this
perspective, we choose the same series of alcohols as before and study
both the steady-state and time-resolved thermal lens signals to explore
the impact of laser intensity on convective heat transfer. Light intensity
provides us the necessary control over the rate of heat generation
in the sample. We show that the higher rate of heat generation with
increasing laser power is counterbalanced by an increased convective
heat transfer. Thus, the emphasis here is more on the rate of heat
generation. Convective heat transfer characterized by thermal lens
spectroscopy may be useful for future optothermal applications. This
study also explores the reliability of TL model for both low- and
high-absorbing samples. We find that the study works well for both
weak and strong thermal lensing systems.

2 Experimental Section
In this thermal lens
study, the dual-beam-mode-mismatched pump–probe scheme is used,
in which one beam acts as a pump beam, while the other beam is used
as a probe beam. Figure 1 shows the experimental setup used in this study. A mode-locked femtosecond
Erbium-doped fiber laser is employed, which generates femtosecond
laser pulses of the central wavelength at 1560 nm with 50 MHz repetition
rate. It also simultaneously produces laser pulses centered at wavelength
780 nm through the second harmonic generation of 1560 nm pulses. Pulse
widths for 1560 and 780 nm pulses are measured to be ∼300 and
∼100 fs, respectively. The 1560 nm beam serves the purpose
of a pump beam, whereas the 780 nm laser beam acts as a probe beam.
The average power of the pump beam at the sample position is varied
from 1.2 to 7.3 mW by using half-wave plate and polarizer combination,
whereas the average power of the probe beam is kept fixed at 6 mW.

Figure 1 Experimental setup for dual-beam thermal lens spectroscopy
with 1560 nm thermal pump and 780 nm probe.

In our mode-mismatched configuration, the probe beam passes through
the sample collinearly with the pump beam. The probe beam is kept
nearly collimated, while the pump beam is focused using a 5 cm lens.
The sample is taken in a 1 mm quartz cuvette, and it is put at the
focus of the pump beam. The central portion of the probe beam is selected
using a partially closed aperture placed at the far field from the
sample position. The intensity of the probe beam after the aperture
is detected by an amplified silicon photodiode (Thorlabs: PDA 100A-EC).
The signal is recorded by a 600 MHz digital oscilloscope (LeCroy WaverRunner
64xi). A mechanical shutter (SR-475) of <500 μs rise and
fall time is placed in the pump arm to measure time-resolved TL signal.
Open and close time windows of the shutter are sufficiently long (5
s) so that the equilibrium condition could be reached. The <500
μs rise and fall time is too short to have any consequential
impact on the details of the TL signal that arises in the order of
milliseconds. Similarly, the individual laser pulse width of 300 fs
does not affect our measurement as the TL signal is the cumulative
effect of millions of pulses within our measurement window of the
shutter open and close times.

Direct determination of Rayleigh
parameters of the pump and probe beams is usually tedious and cannot
be performed within the sample. So, we calibrated our experimental
setup using pure water as a reference sample. However, the beam radius
(ω1p) of the collimated probe beam at the sample
position is measured to be ∼1 mm using the knife-edge technique.
All samples are of spectroscopic grade and used without further purification.
Absorption spectra of these samples are measured by a spectrophotometer
(PerkinElmer Lambda900) to measure the absorption coefficient of the
samples.

3 Results and
Discussion
TL signals of homologous series of primary alcohols
starting from methanol to octanol are measured at different pump laser
powers ranging from 1.2 to 7.3 mW. Each alcohol shows strong absorption
bands in the near-IR region that originates from overtones of fundamental
and combination vibrations of the −OH group.43 The absorption spectra of all of the samples are shown
in Figure 2. Absorbance
in alcohols at 1560 nm wavelength is the highest for methanol, and
it goes down along the homologous series, whereas there is negligible
absorption at 780 nm wavelength. So, we use femtosecond laser pulses
centered at 1560 nm wavelength to excite these samples. Excited molecules
relax back from their excited state to ground state via nonradiative
relaxation pathway. A significant amount of heat generated in this
whole process creates a thermal lens in the sample. In our case of
high-repetition-rate lasers, the time between two successive pulses
is 20 ns, which is very short such that the heat generated by individual
pulse accumulates to a significant amount and gives rise to a very
strong TL signal. The thermal lens formed into these samples is defocusing
in nature due to the negative value of the thermo-optic coefficient
(dn/dT) of the samples. In our mode-mismatch
dual-beam technique, thermal lens is probed using another femtosecond
laser beam centered at 780 nm wavelength by passing through TL and
then through a partially closed aperture placed at far field. The
intensity of the probe beam after aperture changes, as TL modifies
its spatial phase. TL signal is defined as the relative change in
the probe beam intensity when the pump beam is “on”
to the probe beam intensity when the pump beam is “off”.    where I(t) and I(0) are the intensities of probe beam transmitted through an aperture
when pump beam is on and off, respectively. Until time t = 0, the pump beam is off, i.e., shutter is closed, and then the
shutter opens for time t = t, when
the pump beam is on.

series of primary alcohols.

3.1 Steady-State
TL Study
Figure 3 shows the steady-state TL signal of the first eight members
of the homologous series of primary aliphatic alcohols measured at
the focus of the pump beam for three different pump laser powers.
Steady-state TL signal at 1.2 mW laser power is maximum for methanol
and decreases along the higher members of the series. Interestingly,
the maximum of steady-state TL signal shifts to ethanol at 2.9 mW
power and, in turn, shifts to propanol among alcohol series at 7.3
mW laser power. It indicates that the TL signal does not hold the
linear relationship with pump laser power. It can be inferred more
clearly from Figure 4 showing the plot of steady-state TL signal of individual samples
vs laser power. Here, we can see that the steady-state TL signal of
the lower members of the alcohol series tends to saturate at high
laser power. This saturation suggests that the refractive index gradient,
as well as temperature gradient, remains same in spite of greater
heat generation with higher laser power.

It is because the heat
generated in liquids can be transferred by both conductive and convective
modes of heat transfer. Conductive heat transfer mode is predominant
when the thermal load in the sample is small. But the thermal load
is very high at high pump power. Therefore, convective heat transfer
also contributes significantly to heat dissipation, which diminishes
the temperature gradient and results in lesser TL signal. Newton’s
law of cooling relates convective heat transfer per unit time and
temperature difference, which is given as 1  where q is the amount of heat transfer (Joules), hc is the convective heat transfer coefficient
(W/(m2 K)), A is the area (m2), and dT is the temperature difference. Temperature
gradient induced through laser heating will increase with laser intensity
to match heat transfer rate with heat generation rate if hc and A are constant. In our experiment, A is constant as it is imposed by the spot size of the probe
beam at the sample position. But heat transfer coefficient “hc” is generally temperature-dependent
in the case of convection unlike thermal conductivity “k” in the case of conduction process. So, both temperature
gradient and convective heat transfer coefficient can vary with laser
intensity. When dT becomes constant, the rate of
heat transfer varies only due to changes in the heat transfer coefficient.
This situation is encountered in methanol at laser power more than
4 mW, where TL signal remains nearly same. In a similar situation
of laser-induced heating, z-integrated radial temperature
profile measurements for several laser powers using fluorescence thermometry
have been performed in water.44 They also
found that the temperature rise at the beam center is linear at low
laser powers and temperature starts to saturate at higher laser powers.
They rationalized transition from low to high laser power regime by
correlating the change in Peclet number (Pe), which
is the ratio of convection to conduction of heat, between low-power
and high-power regimes.

3.2 Time-Resolved TL Study
Time-resolved TL signal can
give more insight into the heat transfer process. In time-resolved
TL experiments, a mechanical shutter/chopper is used in the pump arm.
As the shutter opens at t = 0, TL starts to build
up in the sample, and consequently, probe beam intensity changes until
steady-state TL is formed. Time-resolved TL signal of methanol at
7.3 mW pump laser power is depicted in Figure 5. The TL signals are recorded for 5 s. This
figure clearly shows the inflection in the time-resolved TL signal
profile of methanol. Recently, we have revealed that this unusual
thermal lens profile of alcohols cannot be explained by the most widely
applicable TL model given by Shen et al.21 The mathematical expression of the TL signal derived by Shen et
al. is given as 2  where . θ contains all properties of a sample on
which the strength of TL depends, where dn/dT is the thermo-optic coefficient of the sample, λp is the wavelength of the probe beam, l is
the sample path length, α is the absorption coefficient, Pe is the average power of the pump beam, and m and V are the geometrical parameters
that are defined as  where ω1e is the pump beam
radius and ω1p is the probe beam radius at the sample
position; zc = πω0p2/λp is the Rayleigh range of Gaussian beam; tc = ωe2/4D is the characteristics time constant; and D is the thermal diffusivity.

Figure 5 Time-resolved TL signal
of methanol and water at 7.3 mW pump laser power.

Shen’s model
considers only the conductive mode of heat transfer. However, a distinctive
feature in the time profile of TL signal in liquids and gases, as
in methanol, shown in Figure 5, is attributed to convective flow induced as a result of
a large temperature gradient formed in the sample. High absorption
at 1560 nm and low thermal conductivity of alcohols lead to a large
temperature gradient. Robust theoretical models have been proposed
in the literature to accommodate the effect of convection in thermal
lens spectroscopy. But these models require numerical treatment to
calculate the TL signal. However, in many cases, it is advantageous
to have an analytical expression that substantially reduces the complexity
and required effort and still offer useful anticipation of the nature
of experimental TL signals. It is sometimes possible to adopt rather
pragmatic treatment based on some valid approximations. So, a new
mathematical expression incorporating both conductive and convective
modes of heat transfer was introduced by little modification in Shen’s
model.28 The following equation gives the
resulting expression for the time-resolved TL signal 3  where .

The quantities (m, V, θ1, θ2, A, λp, dn/dT, α, Pe, F, k, h, td) involved in the above
expression are discussed in detail elsewhere.28 The value of convective heat transfer factor “h” for alcohols is obtained by fitting time-resolved TL signals
into eq 3. It is important
to note that h is the magnitude of heat transfer
rate per unit length. So, the magnitude of heat transfer per unit
area would be “h2”, which
is equivalent to heat transfer coefficient “hc” in eq 1. The quantity h2 is more relevant
than h itself as h2 relates
convective heat transfer rate with dT. To ensure
dimensional consistency for the heat transfer coefficient hc, we consider a constant normalization of h2 by the ratio of the ideal temperature that
is equivalent to the specific laser intensity used for different laser
powers. This additional step ensures that we can now consider a scaled hc (referred to “Hc”) as being equivalent to h2 with the appropriate dimensionality of hc, which we refer to in our subsequent sections.

3.3 Setup Calibration
In
our experiments, instead of calculating the value of m and V via measuring the beam radius ω1e, ω1p, ω0p, and confocal
parameters, we prefer to obtain m and V directly from transient TL signal of water used as a reference sample.
Time-resolved TL signal of pure water along with methanol is depicted
in Figure 5. In spite
of having larger absorption at 1560 nm than methanol, water gives
very less TL signal than methanol. The high value of thermal conductivity
of water renders low thermal gradient that causes weak TL signal in
the water. Therefore, Shen’s model is fitted into the time-resolved
TL signal of water to obtain the values of m and V from best fitting. The values of m and V were found to be 8 and 66.96, respectively. The Shen model
fitted into time-resolved TL signal of water is shown in Figure 6.

time-resolved TL signal
of water at 7.3 mW laser power (black curve) and fits with eq 2 (solid red curve).

3.4 Time-Resolved TL Signal of Methanol
The time-resolved TL signal of methanol measured at different laser
powers is shown in Figure 7. It can be observed in Figure 7 that the inflection in the TL signal of methanol decreases
with decrease in laser power. The value of h at different
laser powers is obtained for methanol by fitting these TL signals
into eq 3. The fixed
quantities needed for fitting are given in Table 1. The values of h along
with other parameters obtained from fitting are listed in Table 2. Figure 8 illustrates the variation
of h with pump laser power.

polynomial fit of the h parameter values.

As we mentioned
above, Hc is equivalent to the convective
heat transfer coefficient; therefore, we also plot Hc vs laser power in Figure 9. Linear fit at laser power above ∼4 mW is expected
since dT is constant, which is inferred from the
saturation of steady-state TL signal of methanol after ∼4 mW
in Figure 4. The larger
rate of heat generation at higher powers (>4 mW) is balanced with
the larger rate of heat transfer through enhancement of convective
heat transfer coefficient. However, both temperature gradient (steady-state
TL signal) in Figure 4 and Hc in Figure 9 vary with laser power below ∼4 mW.

coefficient Hc for methanol vs pump laser
power. The solid line represents the linear fit.

3.5 Time-Resolved TL Signal
of the Alcohol Series
We also determine Hc for different members of homologous series of alcohols
at 7.3 mW laser power to rationalize the trend of steady-state TL
signal in Figure 3.
Time-resolved TL signal of alcohol series measured at 7.3 mW pump
laser power is shown in Figure 10. The values of h at different laser
powers are obtained for alcohols by fitting TL signals into eq 3. Parameters available
for fitting are given in Table 1. The values of h along with other parameters
obtained by fitting are given in Table 3. The convective heat transfer coefficient Hc for different alcohols is plotted in Figure 11. One can see from
this figure that the convective heat transfer coefficient is largest
for methanol and decreases along with chain length in series.

That is because convection relies on the directional flow of fluids
where heat is carried by the constituent molecules by transit from
one place to another. The motion of molecules is highly dependent
upon molecular size, shape, and intermolecular interactions. Small
chain molecules can drift more efficiently and lead to a considerable
amount of convection. Consequently, Hc decreases along the homologous series of the primary alcohols. Due
to a large amount of convection in short-chain alcohols, the steady-state
TL signal is reduced by a sizable amount for methanol at 7.3 mW laser
power and in turn for ethanol, propanol, and so on.

4 Conclusions
Convective heat
transfer process reduces the strength of the TL signal, which limits
the maximum TL at high pump laser power. The inflection in the time
profile of the TL signal of methanol at high power arises because
of high convection, which increases with pump laser power. Methanol
shows the highest TL signal at low pump power, whereas the TL signals
of methanol and ethanol get reduced at high power and hence, the maximum
of the TL signal is shifted to propanol because of high convection
in the short-chain alcohols.
