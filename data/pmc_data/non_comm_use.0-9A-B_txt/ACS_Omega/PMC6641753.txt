This
work uniquely reports the synthesis of ZnxMg1–xO nanowires and submicron
columns by utilizing a traditional carbothermal reduction process
toward forming ZnO nanowire ultraviolet detectors, while simultaneously
utilizing Mg3N2 as the source of Mg. To investigate
the relationship between Mg content in the ZnO lattice and the cutoff
wavelength for high spectral responsivity, the nanowires were annealed
in a series of designed conditions, whereas chemical, nanostructural,
and optoelectronic characteristics were compared before and after
treatment. Postanneal scanning electron micrographs revealed a reduction
of the average ensemble nanowire dimensions, which was correlated
to the modification of ZnO lattice parameters stemming from Zn2+ dissociation and Mg2+ substitution (confirmed
via Raman spectroscopy). The analysis of cathodoluminescence spectra
revealed a blueshift of the peak alloy band-edge emission along with
a redshift of the ZnO band-edge emission; and both were found to be
strong functions of the annealing temperature. The conversion of Zn2SiO4 to Mg2SiO4 (in O2) and MgSiO3 (in Ar) was found to correspond to
transformations (shifting and scaling) of high-energy luminescence
peaks and was confirmed with X-ray diffraction analysis. The tunability
of the cutoff photodetection wavelength was evaluated as the nanowire
arrays exhibited selective absorption by retaining elevated conduction
under high-energy UV-C irradiation after thermal treatment but exhibiting
suppressed conductivity and a single order of magnitude reduction
in both spectral responsivity (Rλ) and photoconductive gain (G) under UV-A illumination.
Noise analysis revealed that the variation of detectivity (D*) depended on the regime of ultraviolet irradiation, and
that these variations are related to thermal noise resulting from
oxygen-related defects on both nanowire and substrate surfaces. These
results suggest a minor design tradeoff between the noise characteristics
of thermally treated ZnMgO nanowire array UV detectors and the tunability
of their spectral sensitivity.

1 Introduction
Ultraviolet,
solar-blind communication systems that exploit atmospheric
scattering to propagate signals toward a nonline of sight receiver
(with ranges on the order of kilometers) have been examined extensively,
yet the detectors in these receiver systems have largely been dominated
by bulky and costly photomultiplier tubes.1−3 Semiconductor-based
deep-UV detectors have consequently become of great interest due to
their potential advantages of producing low-cost, low-power-consumption,
highly scalable solutions. Although ZnO nanowire (NW)-based photodetectors
have been heavily investigated, this material system only exhibits
a cutoff detection corresponding to the band-edge energy of ZnO in
the UV-A spectrum (3.10–3.94 eV).4−6 Substitutional doping
of Mg with ZnO, on the other hand, has been described as a means of
engineering the bandgap of a ternary ZnxMg1–xO system as high as a 5.8
eV for solar-blind photodetectors.7−10 Although Mg has been reported as a feasible
dopant to ZnO (due to the similar ionic radii of Zn2+ and
Mg2+),11,12 Mg/ZnO alloy systems have also
shown to phase segregate for high Mg content.13 Thus, the development of reliable techniques toward synthesizing
aligned ZnO nanowires, and appreciably incorporating Mg during synthesis
is of great significance. Prior work investigating ZnMgO nanostructures
have been reported based on deposition methods, which have ranged
from: molecular beam epitaxy,14 metal–organic
chemical vapor deposition,15,16 pulsed-laser deposition,17 hydrothermal techniques,8,18 radio
frequency magnetron cosputtering,19 and
vapor-phase transport.7,10,20 The vapor-phase transport technique yields highly crystalline nanostructures
and is a relatively straightforward synthesis route, able to encompass
equilibrium formation in one step, rather than necessitating ex situ
incorporation. Additionally, understanding the changes in optical
and physical properties due to postgrowth thermal treatment of ZnMgO
nanowires is of importance toward tuning the cutoff wavelength for
solar-blind photodetectors.

In this study, ZnMgO nanowires and
submicron columns were synthesized
on Si via two equilibrium processes occurring simultaneously: (1)
the carbothermal reduction of ZnO and (2) the incorporation of Mg
from dissociated Mg3N2, which to the best knowledge
of the authors has not been reported. Furthermore, a controlled post
growth annealing study varying annealing environment and annealing
temperature was conducted, demonstrating an evolution of the chemical,
spectral, and optoelectronic properties of the synthesized ZnMgO nanostructures.
Assessed both before and after thermal treatments, these modified
characteristics were investigated via field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray
diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, cathodoluminescence (CL), and
current–voltage (I–V) behavior. The structural changes of ZnMgO nanowires manifested
as modifications of the aspect ratio, while also correlating to modified
estimates of Mg incorporation due to each annealing condition. Analysis
of spectral responsivity and photoconductive gain between treatment
and control groups was conducted under dissimilar ultraviolet regimes
to numerically compare the differences within detector performance.
By exploiting the achieved controlled reaction kinetics from thermal
annealing, enhanced selective filtering of high-energy UV-C absorption
on the nanowire ensemble is demonstrated, accompanied by suppressed
conductivity under UV-A illumination. Additionally, analysis of detector
noise characteristics demonstrated that their variation from ultraviolet
irradiation was linked to the increase of thermal noise from increased
oxygen-related defects, presenting potential performance tradeoffs.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 2a shows
the scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the as-synthesized ZnMgO
nanowire arrays, with a zoomed view of a single nanowire in the inset.
The wires exhibited a vertical (yet regularly offset by a slight angle)
growth pattern with a characteristic coarse surface texture. Energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy mapping presented in Figure 2b further revealed the elemental composition
of the nanowires, confirming the incorporation of Mg. As seen in Figure 2d, EDX quantification
analysis shows that the Mg content relative to Zn extends as high
as 15% upon the initial synthesis. A growth mechanism that accounts
for the carbothermal reduction of ZnO with a Mg3N2 source yields reaction products of ZnxMg1–xO, ZnO, MgO, and Zn2SiO4, as illustrated in Figure 1. Upon subjecting the nanowires to each anneal
condition, the average relative composition of Mg in all anneal cases
widens in variance, and is most pronounced when annealed in O2 at 900 °C. In this case, the median Mg content relative
to Zn is found to be approximately 24%, as shown in Figure 2d. Similarly reported experiments have indicated that the
alloying Mg content reaches saturation due to phase segregation, despite
larger annealing temperatures.8 From Figure 2c the effect of annealing
on nanowire size (diameter and length) does not ostensibly appear
pronounced, however an analysis of variance (ANOVA) coupled with a
pairwise Tukey’s range test confirms a statistically significant
reduction in the distributions of both nanowire dimensions, especially
for higher temperature (see Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information). This reduction is explained by a modification
of the underlying ZnO nanostructure, with Zn2+ vaporizing
and dissociating from the nanowire,21 allowing
Mg2+ to occupy the vacancies and integrate within the crystal
lattice. As presented in Figure 2d, this process is evidenced by a decrease of relative
Zn/O content for all nanowire arrays, whereas Mg content is found
to increase relative to Zn, post annealing. In a similar study, Kim
et al. described coating MgO nanowire surfaces with particle-like
ZnO crystallites that sinter upon annealing, giving rise to increased
dimensions,22 and was further attributed
to an increase in oxygen vacancies that allowed for the relaxation
of interfacial strain.23 In our work, we
find that the ZnO lattice consumes Mg2+, and nanowire dimensions
decrease as the atomic exchange kinetics are reversed.

Presented in Figure 3a are the X-ray diffractograms of all annealed ZnMgO nanostructure
arrays, along with the as-synthesized case (labeled as control). From
the diffraction pattern of the as-synthesized nanowires, characteristic
peaks associated with ZnO, Zn2SiO4, and MgO
(JCPDS 05-0664, JCPDS 00-024-1469, and JCPDS 04-0849, respectively)
can be observed (which indicates a slight degree of phase segregation
between wurtzite ZnO and cubic MgO phases). Because the nanostructures
retain hexagonal form, cubic MgO is not as predominant a reaction
product as ZnO. Additionally, the formation of Zn2SiO4 is largely confined to the substrate, as confirmed by EDX
mapping. As shown in Figure 3b,c, annealing results in a right-shift of the ZnO a axis corresponding to the (100) plane (2θ = 31.7°),
as well as the ZnO c axis corresponding to the (002)
plane (2θ = 34.4°), by as high as Δ2θ = 0.3°
in both cases (note: the presence of bimodal peaks arises from dissimilar Kα excitation energies emitted from the diffractometer).
Principally, the combined effect of a smaller electronegativity and
electronic radius of Mg2+ (Pauling electronegativity: 1.31
and 0.57 Å radius) to that of Zn2+ (Pauling electronegativity:
1.65 and 0.60 Å radius) facilitates the formation of the Mg–O
bond and leads to the decrease of observed lattice parameters.12,24−27 Thus, Mg2+ is effectively substituting Zn2+ without significantly modifying the ZnO nanowire crystal structure,
which further explains the reduced nanowire size distributions from Figure 2c. However, when
these modified lattice parameters are scaled up to the average nanowire
dimensions, we find that this phenomenon alone does not completely
account for the observed reduction in array aspect ratio. Instead,
reduced radial and axial dimensions also stem from Zn2+ dissociating completely from the nanowires, which is especially
evident at high temperatures; and is supported by Zn deposits found
along the sealed ampoule walls. Nonetheless, a summary of the 2θ
peak shifts and lattice parameters is presented in Table 1. In addition to shifts of ZnO
related peaks, new peaks emerge due to reactions on the substrate
surface when annealed at high temperatures. Annealing in inert Ar
results in the formation of MgSiO3 (enstatite, JCPDS 01-088-1924),
whereas annealing in reactive O2 results in the formation
of Mg2SiO4 (forsterite, JCPDS 01-079-1490).
Notably, the diffraction pattern and luminescence spectra of these
mineral forms are a strong function of crystal structure and imperfect
stoichiometry, and these results are further discussed in the context
of cathodoluminescence analysis.

The presence of Mg2+ behaving as a substitutional ion
in a fundamentally ZnO nanostructure is supported by the Raman spectrogram
shown in Figure 4a.
Increasing temperature shifts the peak position of the 1LO phonon
mode from approximately 585 to 605 cm–1, as summarized
in Figure 4b. The modification
of the 1LO peak position is found to be a greater function of temperature
than that of the ambient gas environment, and is attributed to temperature-sensitive
contributions from the LO mode of MgO28 at 720 cm–1. Prior studies have reported that
the maximal Mg content that the ZnO crystal can accommodate is 30%,
corresponding to a Raman shift29 of 615
cm–1. A model that maps Raman shift to Mg content
was developed by Huso et al., utilizing
fine control of Mg in sputtered ZnO thin films to explain a bowing
feature in the Raman spectral response.29,30 By cross-referencing
the change in 1LO peak position to this model, as well as the modification
of 2θ peak diffractions of ZnO, the estimated Mg content incorporated
is demonstrably increased via annealing and agrees with EDX analysis.

The cathodoluminescence
(CL) spectra of all ZnMgO wires were measured
both in the UV-A range, presented in Figure 5a.1, and in the UV-C range, presented in Figure 5b.1. Although the
relative intensity of the band edge of ZnO (≈380 nm) dominates
all other peaks across the spectrum, the intensity of the peak is
found to decrease with increasing annealing temperature, given the
same level of CL excitation current. This is attributed to the increased
formation of O2 defects along the wires, leading to an
increased green-band emission (see Figure S.1, Supporting Information). The higher energy UV-C cathodoluminescence
response, as presented in Figure 5b.1, was normalized to the peak at 156 nm, corresponding
to the bandgap of MgO. From the normalized response, the relative
intensities of two other peaks can be compared, specifically those
between 165 and 183 nm (linked to the band energy ranges of Mg2SiO4 and MgSiO3)31,32 and at 230 nm (linked to the band energy of Zn2SiO4).33,34 The progressive attenuation of
the Zn2SiO4 peak intensity, shown in Figure 5b.3, and the increase
of the Mg2SiO4 and MgSiO3 peak intensity,
shown in Figure 5b.2,
illustrate a relative exchange in composition, directly resulting
from dissimilar anneal environments. Because molecules of Zn tend
toward vapor pressures lower than that of Mg, ZnO nanostructures and
Zn2SiO4 will more preferably dissociate into
Zn2+, O2, and SiO44– at higher anneal temperatures.21 Isolated orthosilicate ions must therefore react
to form forsterite molecules with Mg or equilibrate into silica if
reaction-limited. As previously discussed, Zn deposits were found
along the sealed ampoules, which indicate the vaporization and dissociation
of Zn2+ from the nanowire arrays. As O2 is a
reactive gas, Zn2SiO4 is found to have completely
converted into Mg2SiO4.31 This is validated by the fact that the relative CL peaks associated
with Mg2SiO4 rise considerably under an oxidizing
environment, until forming a close shoulder to the MgO band edge (in
other words, exhibiting a distinct species, rather than coalescing
with MgO). Annealing in Ar reduces the relative peak intensity of
the Zn2SiO4 peak to approximately 75% of its
original level and in the inert environment, must only react with
MgO in a kinetically limited manner to form half as much (molar ratio)
of MgSiO332 (see reactions of
both anneal environments in Figure 1). Mishra et al. have described a modification of the
orbital symmetries t1 and t2 of SiO44– ions,
which have been influenced by the oxidizing reaction mechanics, contributing
to a range of orthosilicate-ion peak position shifts found in Figure 5b.1. These results
are illustrated in Figure 1 and summarize the complex reaction kinetics of Zn2+ dissociation in conjunction with silicate formation as a function
of the annealing environment.

Current–voltage measurements
were conducted vertically across
the nanowire arrays for the as-synthesized case, shown in Figure 6a, and for samples
annealed at 900 °C in O2, shown in Figure 6b. Measurements were conducted
in the dark and in the presence of UV-A (365 nm) and UV-C (254 nm)
monochromatic illumination. The photoconductive properties of ZnO
nanowires have long been attributed to the size effect of nanostructures,
in correspondence with the adsorption/desorption of O2 molecules
along the nanowire surface, leading to surface band-bending and reducing
channel resistivity.35−37 The control case exhibited a negligible difference
in conductance regardless of UV illumination wavelength, which suggests
that band-to-band transition along the ZnO band edge largely contributes
to its photoconductive behavior. However, in the annealed case, UV-A
photoconduction is suppressed due to the increased formation of Zn
vacancies, as evidenced by the attenuation of the peak ZnO band-edge
luminescence, from Figure 5a.1. Specifically, the conductance was found to increase by
almost 2 orders of magnitude (126 times) when illuminated with a UV-C
source, as compared to a lower energy UV-A source, in which the annealed
nanowire array only exhibited an increase of conduction by a factor
of 11. 1   2  The spectral responsivity (Rλ) and photoconductive gain (G)
are key figures of merit that distinguish photodetector systems. These
figures are defined by the relationships expressed in eqs 1 and 2, where
ΔI represents the difference between the photocurrent
and dark current, P is the irradiation power, A is the area impinged by photons on the top surface of
the nanostructures, hν is the illumination
energy, and e is the elementary electronic charge.36 The results of both performance characteristics
are summarized in Table 2 for treated and untreated cases, compared between UV-A and UV-C
illumination. In agreement with the observed changes in photoconduction,
the most notable differences in Rλ and G occur for UV-A illumination (λ = 365
nm), in which at least a single order of magnitude difference is estimated
between the as-grown (Rλ|λ=365 = 1.70 × 10–5 A W–1, G|λ=365 = 5.79 × 10–5) and annealed cases (Rλ|λ=365 = 1.78 × 10–4 A W–1, G|λ=365 = 9.85 × 10–4), illustrating a suppression of UV-A photoconduction in the nanowire
ensemble. Likewise, these figures do not change appreciably with UV-C
illumination. 3   4  To further investigate detection performance
disparities, detector noise characteristics were calculated to distinguish
the sensitivity of ZnMgO nanowires before and after thermal anneal.
Noise equivalent power (NEP) and detectivity (D*)
were evaluated according to eqs 3 and 4, where k is
Boltzmann’s constant, T is the absolute ambient
temperature, Id is the dark current for
a specified operating voltages, Rv is
the device differential resistance, and f is the
amplifier bandwidth (taken as 1 kHz in this analysis).38 Along with detector performance characteristics,
detector noise metrics are also summarized in Table 2 and demonstrate a reduction of NEP for UV-A
illumination (due to decreased spectral sensitivity), whereas a slight
increase in NEP is observed for UV-C illumination. As highly sensitive
detectors tend to exhibit low NEP and high D*, the
sensitivity of ZnMgO detectors increases in conjunction with suppressed
photoconductive gain at λ = 365 nm. Because annealing was found
to reduce Zn content from the nanowire system, electrons from ZnO
become less effective at band-to-band transitions, which diminishes
the effect of surface band-bending from oxygen desorption.39 On the substrate surface, the formation of Mg2SiO4 results in stoichiometrically heterogeneous
MgO films, thereby increasing thermal noise. Annealing in oxygen was
shown to increase the incidence of O2 related green-band
defects (see Figure S.1, Supporting Information), which contribute directly to thermal agitation of charge carriers.40−42 However, this NEP increase is negligible in comparison to the modification
of spectral sensitivity under UV-A illumination, which suggests a
minor design tradeoff between noise and tunability.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, high-quality ZnMgO nanowires have been synthesized
utilizing a novel growth mechanism that incorporates Mg dissociated
from Mg3N2, in tandem with the carbothermal
reduction of ZnO. Modification of the size characteristics, crystal
lattice properties, and spectral response from annealing were found
to be internally consistent with measured Mg content. In particular,
EDX, Raman, and CL revealed a spectral evolution for each treatment
group of nanowire arrays, giving rise to increased Mg2+ incorporation, along with the dissociation of Zn2+. Statistical
inference (ANOVA paired with Tukey’s range test) was undertaken
to discern a reduction of nanowire dimensions, and was cross-referenced
to a modification of the ZnO lattice parameters, as well as the formation
of Zn vacancies.

Suppressed photoconductivity under UV-A illumination
with retained
photoconductivity under high-energy UV-C illumination was observed
for samples post thermal treatment. An order of magnitude difference
for both spectral responsivity and photoconductive gain between the
annealed and control cases confirms the tunable filtering of high-energy
ultraviolet spectral responsivity. Increased thermal noise from the
high-temperature O2 anneal process was associated with
the increase of oxygen-related defects contributing to thermal agitation,
which may present a design tradeoff in integrating ZnMgO as solar-blind
detectors. Thus, these results indicate that synthesized ZnMgO nanowires
demonstrate promising selective UV-C detection capabilities, in which
controlled postsynthesis thermal treatment may effectively tune for
selective, high-pass, solar-blind ultraviolet detection.

4 Experimental Details
ZnMgO nanowires were synthesized using
a vapor-phase transport
method comprised of a carbothermal reduction of ZnO in tandem with
the dissociation of Mg3N2 as the source of Mg.
In a single zone reaction tube furnace, a ceramic boat containing
a 1:1 molar ratio mixture of ZnO and graphite powder (total 3 g) was
placed upstream to another ceramic boat containing 10 g of Mg3N2 powder. Silicon (100) substrates were cleaned
in piranha solution (70% H2SO4, 30% H2O2) and were treated using a buffered oxide etchant (2%
hydrofluoric acid). Subsequently, a thin 10 nm ZnO film was sputtered
(Lesker PVD 250) atop substrates to form a catalyst seed. The samples
were then cleaned using acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and water before
being positioned downstream relative to the source materials. The
tube furnace was evacuated and brought to 500 °C. Upon reaching
the target temperature, Ar was introduced to the system at a flow
rate of 87.4 sccm, while maintaining a steady state pressure of 150
Torr throughout the process. At a rate of 500 °C h–1, the furnace temperature continued increasing up to 1100 °C,
upon which the temperature was held for 24 min. In the final 10 min
of this growth period, O2 was introduced to the system
at a flow rate of 7.5 sccm. Finally, the system was allowed to cool
naturally, without gas flow, under vacuum. This process produced a
conformal, coarse, light-gray deposition consisting of nanowire and
submicron columnar growth on the substrate surface. The sample was
then cleaved into five equally sized pieces, four of which were sealed
in separate quartz ampoules of Ar and O2 environments.
The sealed samples underwent a unique combination of thermal annealing
(650 and 900 °C), with a fixed anneal time of 30 min (conditions
summarized in Table 1). In all cases, a reflective metallic reduced Zn deposit (confirmed
with EDX) was found to have condensed along the ampoule walls. The
four samples, along with the unannealed “control” case,
were morphologically characterized with a field emission scanning
electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S4700-II, excitation 15 kV). A
postgrowth analysis of nanowire size distributions was conducted by
tracing radial and axial dimensions of a sample size of approximately n = 1000 nanowires, for each treatment group, along nine
equally spaced sample regions (corners, edges, and center) within
ImageJ (image processing) software. The relative Mg content was determined
using an energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy attachment by sampling the aforementioned
regions along each sample surface, at an excitation energy of 15 kV.
Modification of crystal structures was determined with a high-resolution
X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical XPert PRO XRD, Kα1 = 1.540598 Å, Kα2 = 1.544426 Å). Ultraviolet luminescence spectra were
ascertained using a JEOL JSM 630 SEM with an attached cathodoluminescence
(CL) system, operating at an excitation current of 0.5 nA for UV-A
analysis and 2 nA for UV-C analysis. Raman spectra were gathered with
a Renishaw InVia spectroscopy system with a 100× objective lens,
using a laser source of λ = 488 nm. Finally, conductance modification
subject to UV illumination (UVP EL Series Lamp, 45 mW cm–2) were determined with a Keithley 4200 Semiconductor Analyzer System
within a “light-tight” micromanipulator probe station,
utilizing tungsten-tipped soft probes. Postexperimental processing
of data which included cleaning, analysis, and visualization was performed
in R language with the ggplot2 library.
