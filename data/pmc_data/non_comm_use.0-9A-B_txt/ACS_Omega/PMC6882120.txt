In this study, a flexible and stable
pH sensor based on aluminum-doped zinc oxide nanosheets (Al-doped
ZnO NSs) was developed by a low-cost hydrothermal method. The results
obtained from this study indicated that Al ions could be doped successfully
into the ZnO nanostructure, which could change the morphology and
improve the pH-sensing properties. The pH sensitivity of Al-doped
ZnO nanosheets reached 50.2 mV/pH with a correlation coefficient of
around 0.99468 when compared with that of ZnO film (34.13 mV/pH) and
pure ZnO nanowires (45.89 mV/pH). The test range of pH values was
widened by Al-doping, and the Al-doped ZnO NS sensor could detect
the pH value ranging from 2 to 12. It was observed that in a more
acidic environment, especially at pH 2, the sensor, Al-doped ZnO nanosheet,
was strongly stable over 12 weeks of testing. It was noted that the
response time was utterly fast and the response time of the sensors
for each pH standard buffer solutions was around 0.3 s. Thus, the
response time and performance were quite stable. The microchannel
provided a novel testing method for the pH sensor, where the liquid
to be tested was just 5 mL. Hence, it was suggested to be useful for
many medical diagnoses and treatments. The benefits of Al-doped ZnO
nanosheet pH sensor were high sensitivity, good long-term usage, good
flexible property, and requirement of a small amount of test liquid,
which could make the sensors viable candidates for practical applications.

==== Body
Introduction
In recent decades, pH sensors
have attracted attention because of their practical application, such
as medical diagnosis and treatment. A lot of research reported that
the potential cancer factor had a direct relationship with the pH
value of blood. It was known that the tumor cells could change the
intracellular fluid to slightly acidic. This is because
of the reason that for tumor cells, it was potentially easier to change
glucose and other body substances into lactic acid (pH).1 The pH value of a cancer patient’s blood
was usually ranging from 6.2 to 6.9 when compared with healthy people
(7.3–7.4). Furthermore, the pH sensor could also be used in
many biochemical monitors that could be applied in our body.2

Metal oxide semiconductors have been used
interestingly in many research studies because of their exclusive
advantages,3 such as low cost, good integration
with the microfabrication of silicon, and excellent controllability.4 There have been a lot of studies reported on
numerous pH sensors based on metal oxides, such as zinc oxide (ZnO),5 tin(IV) oxide (SnO2),6 tungsten trioxide (WO3),7 and titanium dioxide (TiO2).8 Among these, ZnO has a wurtzite hexagonal structure with lattice
constants of a = 0.324–0.326 nm and c = 0.513–0.543 nm, a high band gap energy (∼3.4
eV), and a high exciton binding energy (60 meV) at room temperature.9 It was regarded as very suitable for the pH sensor
because of the high crystallinity of polar and nonpolar surfaces.10 Recently, a lot of
morphology of ZnO nanostructures, such as nanowires (NWs),11 nanorods (NRs),12 nanotubes (NTs),13 nanoflowers (NFs),14 and nanosheets (NSs),15 have been fabricated in which the microscopic sizes have been executed
by varying the physical and chemical properties, and high surface-to-volume
ratio. Ibupoto et al. studied the pH sensor based on immobilized ZnO
NRs with lactate oxidase which showed fast response time by the hydrothermal
method.16 Maiolo et al. reported that the
flexible pH sensor based on ZnO nanowalls could increase the sensitivity
of pH with a higher surface-to-volume ratio.17 Nanostructured ZnO has been fabricated by various methods, such
as plasma–enhanced chemical vapor deposition,18 microwave,19 and hydrothermally.20 Most of the research studies suggested that
ZnO nanostructures could improve the sensitivity of the pH value,
but however, ZnO nanostructures have been found to be less flexible
and stable. Lee and Chiu reported that the pH sensor based on ZnO
NR arrays obtained by the photo-electrochemical method could achieve
a high sensitivity at 53.55, whereas it was hard to use at a lower
pH value (<pH 4).21 Therefore, it was
noted that the property of the pH sensor could influence the stability,
durability, and flexibility of ZnO nanostructures. Previously, a formaldehyde
gas sensor based on aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) thin-film with
high stability and working function have been reported by Liu et al.,
which was fabricated with Al-doped ZnO.22 Lin et al. also reported that AZO could enhance the stability, repeatability,
and reusability for high humidity sensors.23 The similar
function was applied here due to gas sensing property, humidity detects,
and pH value sensing is the chemical reaction. Thus, it was expected
that the stability, durability, and flexibility of the ZnO pH sensor
would be improved by aluminum doping.

The method mentioned above
was applied in this work for the wider range of pH value detection,
long-term use, and reusability of sensors based on Al-doped ZnO NSs.
Additionally, one of the biggest drawbacks of the previously reported
pH sensor was that it usually used soaking methods to detect the pH
value, which could consume a large amount of solution to be tested.
The miniaturization of pH sensors paid great attention on the practical
application of the pH sensor, such as drinking water testing and clinical
medical application. Despite the fact that a lot of successful pH
sensors were already presented,24 the research
on miniaturization was still sparse. Thus, in our work, in order to
deal with this issue, microfluidic technology was applied to fabricate
the shrinking pH sensors, which could be portable and can test an
extremely small amount of liquid sample. Kunstmann-Olsen et al. reported
uniform droplet splitting and detection by microfluidic polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS).25 In 2017, Usta et al. studied
about recent advances of PDMS application to microfluidic technology,26 and Im et al. studied the PDMS-based turbulent
microfluidic mixer.27 According to PDMS
microfluidic technology, it was a good opportunity to combine with
the pH sensor for miniaturization. It was reported that PDMS could
not only have an easy fabrication method but also could have low cost
and good binding on the glass substrate. Additionally, it was noted
that a reference electrode of the pH sensor using silver–silver
chloride (Ag/AgCl) ink could replace the traditional Ag/AgCl glass
electrode, which could be feasibly produced very fast, and also it
was easy to coat on the metal electrode.28 The key technology of this work was that the prepared microfluidic
channel could overcome the drawbacks reported by previous research
studies and could also integrate the pH sensor with a microfluidic
channel. On the other hand, the unique morphology was applied to fabricate
the pH sensor based on Al-doped ZnO NSs with increased sensitivity
and durability.

Results and Discussion
Materials Characterizations
Figure 1 shows the comparison
of morphology of Al-doped ZnO NSs and pure ZnO NWs obtained by an
ultrahigh-resolution scanning electron microscope. Figure 1a displays the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) top-view image of the Al-doped ZnO NSs, which confirmed
that the NS structures were evenly distributed. The as-fabricated
Al-doped ZnO NSs were constituted by several irregular high walls,
with average thickness and length around 200 nm and 1 μm, respectively. Figure 1b compares the top-view
image of SEM of pure ZnO NFs, which demonstrated that the synthesized
ZnO NWs without Al-doping could possess the vertical, dense, and wire-like
morphology, with common diameters around 80 nm. The inset of Figure 11a,b shows the high-resolution
top-view image of SEM of Al-doped ZnO NSs and pure ZnO NWs, respectively,
the 45° view image of SEM of Al-doped ZnO NSs and pure ZnO NWs
are shown in Figure 1c,d, respectively. The inset of Figure 1c,d illustrates the SEM cross-section images
of the Al-doped ZnO NSs and pure ZnO NWs, respectively. It could be
seen that the average height of Al-doped ZnO NSs was 1.61 μm
and that of pure ZnO NWs was 2.18 μm. It was obvious that aluminum
doping could influence the morphology, density, and length of the
ZnO nanostructure, and this result was similar to that of the result
previously reported by Kim et al.29

SEM). The SEM 45-degrees images of (c) Al-doped ZnO NSs, and (d) pure
ZnO NWs. (Inset: SEM cross-section images).

The crystal phase of the Al-doped ZnO NSs, ZnO film, and pure ZnO
NWs was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as shown in Figure 2. The XRD patterns represented
that the sharp diffraction peaks were in good agreement with the characteristics
of the hexagonal wurtzite of ZnO (JCPDS no. 36-1451). According to
previous research studies, the diffraction peaks of the Al element
may not be presented in the XRD patterns, the possible reason for
that could be the low doping concentration of Al, and this trend was
similar to that of the result previously reported by Jantrasee.30 Upon comparison of all the samples, the ZnO
film showed the diffraction peaks centered at 2θ values of 34.4,
47.59, and 62,87° as shown in Figure 2a corresponding to the crystal planes of
the hexagonal wurtzite zinc oxide (002), (102), and (103) reflections,
respectively. Similar to the film, the diffraction peaks of pure ZnO
NWs were observed at 34.38, 47.54, and 62,83° corresponding to
(002), (102), and (103) reflections, respectively. The Al-doped ZnO
NS sample showed no diffraction peaks corresponding to the aluminum
element because of the reason that the Al element was well incorporated
within the ZnO lattice. The comparison of enlarged XRD patterns of
the Al-doped ZnO NSs and pure ZnO NWs is shown in Figure 2b. It was found that the intensity
of the (002) peak of Al-doped ZnO NSs was comparatively lower than
that of pure ZnO NWs, which could reduce the surface energy of ZnO
as Al replaced the Zn ions of the hexagonal wurtzite structure.31 It was evident from the XRD pattern of Al-doped
ZnO NSs that the peaks at 31.83 and 36.38° corresponded to the
(100) and (101) reflections, respectively, which indicated that the
Al-doping could influence the
orientation of ZnO nanostructure from the x-axis
changing to isotropic.32 On the other hand,
the (002) peak of ZnO NSs was significantly shifted to the larger
diffraction angle when compared to pure ZnO NWs because of the replacement
of Zn2+ ions (ion radius 0.74 Å) by smaller Al3+ ions (ion radius 0.53 Å).33

ZnO NSs, pure ZnO NWs, and ZnO film. (b) Enlarged XRD patterns of
the (002) peak.

The crystal phase of Al-doped ZnO was further confirmed by
a high-resolution transmission electron microscope as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3a shows the fragments of Al-doped
ZnO NSs scraped from the sample and the inset shows the high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images. Figure 3b shows the selected area of
electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, from which the lattice d spacing of the sample was calculated. The SAED pattern
of Al-doped ZnO NSs illustrated the polycrystalline nature of the
sample. The lattice d spacing was calculated by the
following equation34 1  where L is the length of the camera, λ is
the electron wavelength, and R is the radius of the
ring calculated from the bright ring of the center. The SAED pattern of
Al-doped ZnO NSs was calculated by eq 1, indexed as (100), (002), and (101) planes, corresponding
to the polycrystalline crystallography. It was found that the Al-doped
ZnO NS indexes of the SAED pattern were perfectly consistent with
the XRD result. Figure 3c shows a pink rectangular frame selected area of the Al-doped ZnO
NS as measured by HR-TEM elemental mapping. The sample illustrated
the uniform elements of aluminum (green), zinc (red), and oxygen (yellow)
element, which were consistent with the measurement of energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy as shown in Figure 3d. The EDX spectrum of Al-doped ZnO NSs examined
the elemental composition, which clearly illustrated that the calculated
atomic percentage of Zn, O, and Al was 37.69, 56.2, and 6.06%, respectively.

Microchannel pH Sensor Analysis and pH
Value Testing
First of all, the size of the microfluidic
channel of pH sensors was measured by a three dimensional (3D) measuring
laser microscope (OLS5000, LEXT), and the width and height of the
microchannel were around 258 and 39 μm, respectively, as shown
in Figure 4.

Figure 4 3D measuring
laser microscopy images of a microchannel of the pH sensor.

Figure 5 shows the
pH sensitivities of the Al-doped ZnO NS pH sensor tested by an extended
gate using different pH standard buffer solutions (from pH 2 to 12),
and the solutions were passed through a microchannel with a reference
electrode (Ag/AgCl). Figure 5a shows the source–drain current (IDS) output characteristics of the pH sensor with the constant
reference electrode voltage (VG) at 3
V. It was found that the IDS of the Al-doped
ZnO NS pH sensor increased as the pH value of the buffer solutions
decreased because of the reason that the voltage of Al-doped ZnO NSs
was influenced by the acidic conditions. Accumulating H+ ions of the solutions contributed an extra positive voltage of the
sensing material, while the IDS was decreased
by the accumulation of OH– ions, which corresponded
to an extra negative voltage. As a result, the IDS of the pH sensor could be affected by varying the pH value
of the buffer solutions. Figure 8b shows the source–drain current and reference
electrode voltage characteristics (IDS – VG) of the Al-doped ZnO NS
pH sensor with the constant source–drain voltage (VDS) at 0.2 V. It was found that the VG was shifted to higher voltages by increasing the pH
values, with relatively increased IDS current
from 0 A when injected into solutions with pH values ranging from
12 down to 2.

Figure 5 (a) Drain–source
current and drain–source voltage characteristics, and (b) drain–source
current and reference electrode voltage characteristics of the Al-doped
ZnO NS pH sensor with the microchannel.

Figure 6 shows the comparison of the calculated sensitivity of the
Al-doped ZnO NS, ZnO NW, and ZnO film sensor. The relationship between
the IDS and pH value of sensors could
be assessed by basic metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors,35 where the altered threshold voltage (VT) depended on pH value. The saturation region
was defined by the following equation36 2  and for the linear region 3  where Kn is the conduction parameter, VGS is the source–gate voltage that is related to the VG, and VDS is the
drain–source voltage. The dependence of VT on pH was presented by Chou et al.37Figure 6a represents
the three-round testing sensitivity of the ZnO thin film, which was
found to be 34.13, 32.21, and 33.48 mV/pH with correlation coefficients
of 0.99233, 0.9828, and 0.9815, respectively. Figure 6b shows the three-round pH sensitivity measurements
of the ZnO NW which was found to be 44.54, 45.35, and 45.89 mV/pH
with correlation coefficients of 0.99204, 0.99191, and 0.9919, respectively. Figure 6c shows the sensitivity
of Al-doped ZnO NSs by three-round testing results which was found
to be 49.62, 48.19, and 50.3 mV/pH with correlation coefficients of
0.99742, 0.99229, and 0.99468, respectively. It was found that the
ZnO NW could increase the sensitivity of the pH value, whereas the
stability and flexibility decreased. However, it was observed that
it could not sense the pH 2 solution. According to previous
studies, ZnO NWs can improve sensing performance because of a large
sensing surface-to-volume ratio, while the surface-to-volume ratio
leads the material to come in contact with many buffer solutions.
Also, zinc oxide is a material that is relatively easy to react with
the acidic solution; as a result, the ZnO NW pH sensor is destroyed
when pH 2 solution is tested, and this result is quite similar with
the previous research.38 The sensitivity
of Al-doped ZnO NSs was also improved and was higher than that of
ZnO NWs, and thus, it displayed better stability and flexibility over
the pH ranging from pH 2 to pH 12. Actually Al-doping caused the ZnO
nanostructure to be more flexible and stable.39 In addition, all the three-round testing sensitivities of the pH
value of each sensor almost showed the same results, where the potential
changes of the sensors were affected very little by testing several
pH levels. According to the previous reports, it was reported that
once the potential deviation of sensors was less than ±5 mV,
the applications of sensors would be valuable and reliable.40

Figure 6 Three-rounds
pH responses
of (a) ZnO film, (b) ZnO NWs, (c) Al-doped ZnO NSs from pH 2 to pH
12.

The response time of the pH sensor with
a microchannel was tested by the buffer solutions from pH 2 to pH
12 as shown in Figure 7. According to the previous reports, the response time of pH sensors
could be commonly defined as the time of 90% of the sensors reaching
a stable potential.41Figure 7 shows the response time of
the Al-doped ZnO NS pH sensor with the microchannel at pH 2 and pH
12. In the beginning, the current of sensors remain stable at zero,
after 0.2 s the pH solutions are injected to the sensors and the sensors’
reactions become stable at around 0.5 s. The total reaction time takes
around 0.3 s from the time of injection (0.2 s) to the chemical reactions
becoming stable (around 0.5 s). The time from the injection to reach
the stable potential was found to be 0.34 s for pH 2 and 0.28 s for
pH 12, where the pH sensors tested with a microchannel were extremely
faster than the soaking method. The statistical analysis of the response
time is shown in Figure 7c. It was observed that the response time of the pH sensor with a
microchannel was found to be 0.3 s for any pH value, all with the
same value for five rounds of testing in each pH which was very stable
and quick. The response time and reliability of pH sensors were necessary
for many applications such as biochemical monitors.

response time in several
buffer solutions with (a) pH 2 value, (b) pH 12 value, and (c) statistic
chart from pH 2 to pH 12.

Figure 8 compares the durability of ZnO film and Al-doped ZnO NSs
for a duration of 12 weeks. The source–drain current output
characteristics of ZnO film and Al-doped ZnO NSs in pH 2 was between
0 and 12 weeks. It was found that the ZnO NW could not response at
pH 2 because of a more acidic environment, and the ZnO film would
be unstable after 12 weeks; however, Al-doped ZnO NSs exhibited enhanced
stability and durability properties after 12 weeks. Thus, it was suggested
that both the reliability and long-term usage of pH sensors should
be considered for the applications.

Al-doped ZnO NSs in terms of 12 weeks in pH 2.

Mechanism of Al-Doped ZnO NS pH-Testing
Basically, the surface
of metal oxides was hydrolyzed by water and thus hydroxide was formed
on the surface. The surface would become rich in the polar hydroxyl
(−OH) groups as the polar water molecules were adsorbed by
the layer physically. Once the Al-doped ZnO NS has undergone a chemical
reaction with an electrolyte, the surface charge would be increased
by several reasons such as adsorption of ions, accumulation or consumption
of the surface charge from the surface of materials, and physical
adsorption of surface charge. The H-specific binding sites of the
material would be hydrogenated when the surface of Al-doped ZnO NSs
was in contact with the buffer solution, which could protonate or
deprotonate the binding sites of the material because of the increase
or decrease of the surface charge at different pH values of the solutions.42 In addition, the Al-doped ZnO NS could chemically
react with acidic and basic solutions because the material was an
amphoteric oxide. The chemical reaction of acidic and basic solutions
could be defined by the following eqs 4 and 5, respectively.

In
acid buffer 4  

In basic buffer 5  pH-sensing
tests of ZnO film, ZnO NWs, and Al-doped ZnO NSs were divided into
two probable ways for the pH values of solutions such as <pH 7
and >pH 7. In the acidic buffer, the potential difference of the
solutions was found to be higher than the materials, where the solutions
contained more H+ compared with the binding sites of the
materials. By contrast, in the basic buffer, the charged surface of
the materials would lose protons to form OH–, where
the surface of materials would become negatively charged.43 The pH-sensing property of Al-doped ZnO NSs
might be attributed for several reasons. First, the morphology effect,
that is, the surface to volume ratio of Al-doped ZnO NSs was much
higher than that of the others. The possible mechanism proposed for
pH-sensing of Al-doped ZnO NSs is shown in Figure 9. In the present work, Al doping caused a
change in the morphology of ZnO nanostructures, as shown in the SEM
images (Figure 1).
As we mentioned above, the pH-sensing chemical reaction occurred when
the electrolyte solution was in contact with the surface of the metal
oxides. Thus, the responses of pH sensors increased with the increase
of the surface to volume ratio. Second, the oxygen vacancies of Al-doped
ZnO NSs should also produce considerable effects on the pH-sensing
properties because the oxygen vacancies could influence the number
of binding sites for the pH-sensing reaction. In our previous study,
based on the EDX spectra it was reported that the Al-doped ZnO NS
possessed more oxygen vacancies,15 as shown
in Figure 3d. Upon
the formation of unsaturated dangling bonds at the surface, the surface
would produce more oxygen vacancies, which could lead the fast chemical
reaction. Thus, the ability of chemical adsorption and desorption
with the surface would increase.44Table 1 shows the comparison
of the pH-sensing property of pH sensors based on several metal oxide
materials with the pH sensors reported in previous studies. It was
thus suggested that the microfluidic Al-doped ZnO NS pH sensor possessed
good sensitivity, extremely fast response time, flexibility, long-term
utility, and reliability. Also, the pH
testing solutions are just needed a few due to microfluidic integrate
with the pH sensor.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a microfluidic pH sensor with
the novel morphology of ZnO nanostructures based on Al-doped ZnO NSs
by the hydrothermal method and the sensor showed flexible, reliable,
high response, and fast response time. The results illustrated that
the pH sensitivities increased from 34.13 mV/pH (ZnO film) to 50.3
mV/pH (Al-doped ZnO NS) and the sensitivities were very stable for
three-round testing. The pH-sensing response time was found to be
around 0.3 s, which was extremely fast. The flexible property of Al-doped
ZnO NSs was also improved, over the pH ranging from pH 2 to pH 12
and upon long-term use, and the sensor still remained stable after
12 weeks testing. A new detection method was thus provided by the
microchannel, where the testing solution required was just 5 mL only.
This study might provide a significant potential of pH sensors for
the applications in many biochemical monitors that could be applied
in our body.

Experimental Section
Fabrication of Al-Doped ZnO NSs and pH Sensors
The Al-doped ZnO NSs were fabricated in two stages: first, 50 nm
Al film as a seed layer was evaporated on a glass substrate by electron
beam evaporation. Second, a low-temperature hydrothermal process was
carried out using zinc nitrate hydrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O] and hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4, HMTA). To fabricate the Al-doped ZnO NSs,
aqueous solution of 60 mM zinc nitrate and 60 mM HMTA were mixed into
deionized water (DI water), and then stirred for 15 min at 90 °C.45 The prepared solution and the substrate were
transferred into a serum bottle and heated at 95 °C for 1 h.
After the reaction was completed, the serum bottle was cooled to room
temperature, then the glass substrate was washed with acetone and
DI water, and dried in air. The properties of three varieties of pH
sensors such as: (1) ZnO film, (2) ZnO NW, and (3) ZnO NS were compared. Figure 10 shows a schematic
representation and picture of the Al-doped ZnO NS structured pH sensor.
First, the glass substrate was washed with acetone, isopropanol, and
DI water with an ultrasonic cleaner for 15 min. Then, the platinum
(Pt) working and reference electrodes were evaporated by electron
beam evaporation. The chamber was evacuated down to 5 × 106 Torr and kept the voltage and current of the electron gun
over 4.5 kV and 15 mA, respectively, and platinum vapor was continuously
deposited on the substrate until the thickness was reached up to 100
nm. A definite region of the synthesized sensing film was controlled
by photoresist. The three different sensing structures were obtained
for the working electrode as mentioned above with a region of 1 cm
× 250 μm. The inset of Figure 10 shows the SEM image of Al-doped ZnO NSs.
The thickness of Ag/AgCl ink (cat#011464, ALS Co., Ltd., Japan) was
approximately 150 μm with a region of 1 cm × 250 μm
as a reference electrode, which was fabricated on the Pt electrode
by using a hot plate at 95 °C for 30 min.

Microfluidic System Development and Measurement System Setup
Figure 11 shows the fabrication process of a microchannel in
PDMS combined with the pH sensor. The main fabrication
of PDMS layer using traditional photolithography technology and expansion
of formerly presented researches.46 The
layout for masks was drawn by a computer-aided design program (AutoCAD
2011, Autodesk, the United States). A master formed on
a silicon wafer using a negative-tone UV photoresist (SU8-2100, MicroChem
Corporation, Newton, MA), which has thin flat layers with a microchannel
was fabricated. A curing agent and PDMS (cat#SYGARD-184AB, Goal Bio,
R. O. C.) at a 1:10 weight ratio were completely stirred. Then, this
mixture was degassed by a mechanical vacuum pump at 30 mTorr for 1
h, which could remove any air bubbles and make sure the mixing was
uniform. The prepolymer mixture was poured onto the master mold, and
then it was cured for 4 h at 100 °C in an oven. After curing,
PDMS was peeled off from the master mold and then bonded to the pH
sensor by oxygen plasma bonding. The width, height, and length of
the microchannel were 250 μm, 35 μm, and 3 cm, respectively.
Finally, a polytetrafluoroethylene tube with a needle was attached
to both sides of the microchannel and fixed with adhesive and clay.

the fabricating
process of microfluidic PDMS and bonding to the pH sensor.

Figure 12 shows
the measuring system of the microfluidic pH sensor. The sensing region
was connected to the gate of a commercial metal-oxide-semiconductor
field-effect transistor (MOSFET, CD4007UB). The pH sensor was measured
by the Agilent B2902A Precision source/measure unit with pH standard
buffer solution varied from 2 to 12 ± 0.02 (GREAT and BEST Co.,
Ltd, R. O. C.). The property of pH sensors was defined by the potentiometric
method, which was calculated from the potential difference between
the reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) and the sensing electrode. First
of all, the pH standard buffer solution was inspected by a pH meter.
(F-51, HORIBA, Ltd., Japan), then the buffer solution was injected
into our pH sensor by a syringe pump. After injection, the microchannel
was washed with ethanol and DI water at each testing. The pH sensor
with microfluidic was measured by the buffer solution from alkaline
(pH 12) to acidic (pH 2) for sensitivity, durability, stability, and
repeatability.

sensor testing.

Characterization
The morphology of Al-doped ZnO NSs, pure ZnO NWs, and ZnO films
were characterized by an ultrahigh-resolution scanning electron microscope
( Hitachi SU8000, Japan), and analyzed by XRD (18 kW Rotating Anode
X-ray Generator, Rigaku). The Al-doped ZnO NSs were measured by a
high-resolution transmission electron microscope and energy dispersive
spectrometer (JEOL JEM-2100F CS-STEM, Japan).
