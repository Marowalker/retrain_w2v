Li3TaO4 with a high melting point,
good thermal
stability, and higher lithium content has become a possible choice
for breeder materials, which have potential applications in future
fusion reactors. Perfect and defect crystal models of Li3TaO4 are set up, and all of the tritium-diffusion pathways
have been studied by the first-principles method. The activation energy
barriers of different diffusion pathways are calculated and analyzed
considering the pathway length and tritium–oxygen interactions.
The obtained minimum energy barrier for tritium diffusing in the perfect
Li3TaO4 crystal is only 0.34 eV. The minimum
energy barrier is less than 0.72 eV when tritium diffuses in the defect
Li3TaO4 crystal in the presence of a lithium
vacancy. Finally, the diffusion coefficients of tritium in the Li3TaO4 crystal are calculated, which further confirm
that it is easy for tritium to escape from the trap of the lithium
vacancy and diffuse in the crystal. Such a tritium-diffusion behavior
is in favor of the tritium-release process of the Li3TaO4 crystal and could provide theoretical guidance for the future
applications of Li3TaO4 materials.

1 Introduction
Lithium ceramic materials
have attracted much attention for their
potential applications as blanket materials in the nuclear fusion
reactor, mainly due to their favorable properties such as high melting
temperatures, low chemical reactivity, and high lithium (Li) densities.1−4 A number of lithium ceramic materials including Li2O,
Li4SiO4, Li2TiO3, Li2ZrO3, and LiAlO2 have being investigated
both theoretically and experimentally.5−11 In recent years, LiTaO3 has become one of the potential
ceramic breeder materials because of its high melting point and high
thermal conductivity.12,13 As we know, crystalline LiTaO3 is an outstanding material for its unique optical and ferroelectric
properties, which has been studied systematically and used in many
fields.14,15 In 2005, Naranjo et al. have found that
the deuterium–deuterium (D–D) fusion reaction could
be generated by gently heating the LiTaO3 crystal in a
deuterated atmosphere.12 It has been predicted
that LiTaO3 may have a higher tritium release rate than
Li4SiO4 and Li2TiO3, according
to the study of the behaviors of hydrogen isotopes in LiTaO3.13 However, the lithium density is quite
low in LiTaO3, which limits its practical application as
a blanket material. Therefore, Li3TaO4 with
a higher Li content has become a possible choice as a blanket material
due to its high melting point and good thermal stability.

Current
studies on Li3TaO4 mainly include
its crystal structure16,17 and fabrication.18−20 Considering its potential application as a blanket material, the
tritium-diffusion behavior in the Li3TaO4 crystal
is essential and important to understand the tritium-release process.
Besides, the tritium-release behavior is affected by various irradiation-induced
defects, especially the lithium vacancy, because lithium atoms are
constantly knocked out of their positions to generate tritium under
irradiation. Several tritium-diffusion behaviors have been studied
for Li4SiO4, Li2TiO3,
Li2ZrO3, and LiAlO2 crystals, and
the activation energies predicted by related experiments and theoretical
works normally range from 0.59 to 1.55 eV.21−27 However, there is no reported theoretical and experimental work
on the tritium-diffusion properties of the Li3TaO4 crystal so far.

In this work, a comprehensive first-principles
study of tritium
diffusion in the Li3TaO4 crystal is presented.
The perfect crystal model and the defect crystal model are set up
and considered, respectively. The energy barrier and diffusion pathway
of tritium in Li3TaO4 are calculated and analyzed
to explain the tritium-diffusion process. Such theoretical results
of tritium diffusion in the Li3TaO4 crystal
are of prime importance for the understanding of the tritium behavior
in the release process, which provides a theoretical guide for the
design of the tritium breeding blankets.

2 Theoretical Model and Methods
In our
study, according to the related experimental parameters,
a 2 × 1 × 1 supercell of Li3TaO4 was
employed, and then its geometry was optimized using density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. The calculations have been performed by
the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).28,29 The projector augmented-wave (PAW) method30 and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE)31 were implemented. Convergence tests
were conducted to determine the energy cutoff of the plane-wave basis
and the K-point grid. Then, the plane-wave cutoff
energy was set as 500 eV, and the geometry optimization was performed
with the 2 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst–Pack K-point grid. Our benchmark calculations indicate that the error of
total energy arising from this k-point sampling is
less than 1 meV/atom. All of the structures are fully relaxed until
the force on each atom is less than 0.003 eV/Å. All tritium (T)
atoms were treated as hydrogen atoms as they present the same electronic
properties within DFT calculations.

Besides, the formation energy EF(VLi) for the defect
model of Li3TaO4 is defined as follows32,33 1  Etot(VLi) is the total energy derived from a supercell containing
the defect of a neutral Li vacancy, Etot(Li3TaO4) is the total energy for the perfect
crystal using an equivalent supercell, and ELi-metal (−3.61 eV) is the mean atom energy of
the Li metal. Ef is the Fermi level, referenced
to the valence-band maximum (VBM, Ev)
in the bulk, and ΔV is the correction term
to align the reference potential in our defective supercell with that
in the perfect bulk.

The formation energy EF(TLi) of a tritium atom adsorbed
in a neutral Li vacancy,
namely the adsorption energy, is defined similarly to EF(VLi) 2  Etot(TLi) is the total energy of a Li3TaO4 supercell with tritium adsorbed in the Li vacancy, and Evac is the total energy of an equivalent Li3TaO4 supercell with a Li vacancy. ET is the chemical potential of a tritium atom (−1.12
eV). The rest of the items are identical to the equation of EF(VLi). Because
our studied defect is a neutral vacancy and the length of the supercell
is relatively large (≈10 Å), it is noted that the ΔV values in the above two equations are actually neglected
in our simulations.

Based on the above adsorption properties,
the energy barriers of
different diffusion pathways are further calculated with the climbing
image nudged elastic band (NEB) scheme.34−36 When the length of the
diffusion path is less than 2 Å, we use five images to ensure
the calculation accuracy of the energy barriers and increase to seven
images when the length is more than 2 Å.

3 Results and Discussion
β-Li3TaO4 is a monoclinic crystal within
the C2/c space group. Each primitive
cell contains 64 atoms of 24 lithium (Li) atoms, 8 tantalum (Ta) atoms,
and 32 oxygen (O) atoms, whose structure is presented in Figure 1. The labels of different
colors listed on the right of Figure 1 correspond to the different types of atoms, respectively.
It is noted that the blue tritium atoms in Figure 1 present the diffusion pathway, which will
be discussed in the next section. As shown in Figure 1, every Li atom or Ta atom bonds with the
neighboring six oxygen atoms, while each O atom bonds with the neighboring
six atoms, which include four Li atoms and two Ta atoms or five Li
atoms and one Ta atom. Initially, we relax the perfect crystal Li3TaO4 model, and obtain the lattice parameters of a = 8.5665 Å, b = 8.5607 Å, c = 9.4109 Å, and β = 116.94°, which are
close to the experimental results of a = 8.5080 Å, b = 8.5160 Å, c = 9.3380 Å, and
β = 116.87°.16,17

3.1 Tritium Adsorption and Diffusion in the Perfect
Li3TaO4 Crystal
First of all, the adsorption
and diffusion of tritium atoms in the perfect Li3TaO4 crystal are thoroughly studied. As we know, the diffusion
of a tritium atom takes place between different stable and metastable
sites, and thus, the adsorption of tritium in different sites should
be investigated first. Preliminary tests show that the T atom will
be adsorbed by the O atom to form a tritium–oxygen (T–O)
bond regardless of the initial positions. Therefore, the tritium adsorptions
on different types of O atoms are calculated and analyzed. Totally,
four types of O atoms (types A–D) have been plotted in Figure 1.

Around each
type of O atom, the tritium atom is placed at eight initial positions,
which are 1.1 Å away from the O atom, and then the entire system
is optimized by DFT calculations. The results show that the adsorption
energy varies from 0.21 to 0.57 eV, with the difference in different
types of O atoms less than 0.4 eV, and the length of the T–O
bond is about 0.98 Å, with the difference less than 0.01 Å.
At the same time, each O atom has multiple metastable adsorption sites,
with an energy difference of less than 0.3 eV. This fact implies that
the T atom could migrate between different metastable adsorption sites
on the same O atom at very low temperatures.

Based on the above
results, the tritium-diffusion pathways in the
perfect Li3TaO4 crystal are calculated. The
energy barriers in the considered pathways are treated with the climbing
image nudged elastic band (NEB) scheme.34−36 Considering the tritium
diffusion between all of the four types of O atoms (types A–D),
the T-diffusion pathways can be divided into 10 types, which are listed
in Table 1. For instance,
path 1 is the pathway A–A, which corresponds to the pathway
from one oxygen atom of type A to another oxygen atom of the same
type. For each type of diffusion pathway, a number of cases including
pathways between different metastable sites have been calculated,
and finally, the lowest diffusion energy barrier for each type of
pathway is obtained and presented in Table 1. As it is shown, the highest energy barrier
is 1.20 eV, which exists in path 1, and the lowest energy barrier
is 0.34 eV in path 5. To better display the diffusion properties,
path 5 has been plotted in Figure 1, which corresponds to the tritium diffusion from a
type A oxygen atom to a type B oxygen atom. To explain the energy-barrier
difference in different paths, the pathway lengths for all of the
paths are presented in Table 1 as well. It could be concluded that the energy barrier is
generally high when the path length is long and vice versa. When the
diffusion path is longer, the distance of the T–O bond gets
longer and the interaction is weakened, which may influence the distribution
of the potential-energy surface and finally lead to the high diffusion-energy
barrier.

Table 1 Lowest Energy Barrier for 10 Types
of Tritium-Diffusion Pathways in the Perfect Li3TaO4 Crystal
 	pathway	energy barrier
(eV)	pathway length
(Å)	
path 1	A–A	1.20	3.06	
path 2	B–B	0.36	2.26	
path 3	C–C	0.35	2.38	
path 4	D–D	0.68	2.53	
path 5	A–B	0.34	1.79	
path 6	A–C	0.83	2.86	
path 7	A–D	0.60	2.44	
path 8	B–C	0.42	2.23	
path 9	B–D	0.71	2.79	
path 10	C–D	0.58	2.74	
To further verify this fact, we analyze the local
density of states
(LDOS) of T and O atoms in the longest path 1 and the shortest path
5, which has been plotted in Figure 2. The corresponding O atoms are at both ends of the
diffusion paths 1 and 5, respectively. The LDOS in Figure 2a,b indicates that when tritium
diffuses in the longer path 1, the T–O bond breaks, which results
in the higher energy barrier. The peaks appearing near the Fermi level
in Figure 2c,d imply
that the T–O interaction is stronger during the tritium diffusion
in path 5 than in path 1. Thus, we could conclude that the energy
barriers for the different pathways are influenced by the pathway
length, which is related to the T–O interaction during the
diffusion.

Figure 2 LDOS of tritium (T) and oxygen (O) atoms in the diffusion path
1 (a, b) and path 5 (c, d).

It is worth noting that the diffusion pathway with
a high energy
barrier actually could be implemented by the combination of other
paths with a lower energy barrier. This means that the tritium atom
actually does not have to diffuse through the pathway with a high
energy barrier to migrate in the crystal. For example, path 1 from
A to A can be performed along the way of A–C–B–D–A,
which corresponds to path 6–path 8–path 9–path
7, and the highest barrier in these diffusion pathways is 0.83 eV.
Considering the combination of pathways, we conclude that the tritium
could diffuse in the perfect Li3TaO4 crystal
with a minimum energy barrier of 0.34 eV, which means that T could
migrate easily in the Li3TaO4 crystals at low
temperatures.

3.2 Tritium Adsorption and Diffusion inside the
Li Vacancy of Li3TaO4
Lithium vacancies
are considered as primary irradiation-induced defects in lithium-based
breeder materials, as lithium atoms are constantly knocked out of
their positions or consumed to generate tritium under irradiation.
In the Li3TaO4 crystal plotted in Figure 3a, there are three different
kinds of Li atoms, which correspond to three types of Li vacancies
(types I–III). The labels of different colors listed on the
right correspond to the different types of atoms, respectively. The
adsorption and diffusion inside each type of Li vacancy are simulated
and thoroughly analyzed in this section.

Figure 3 (a) Primitive cell of
the Li3TaO4 crystal.
(b) Defect model of the Li3TaO4 crystal with
type II lithium vacancies. (c) Sketch map of the octahedron configuration
of each type of Li vacancy.

To ensure the reliability of the results, the formation
energy
of each Li vacancy in the 2 × 1 × 1 supercell and 2 ×
2 × 2 supercell are calculated respectively. Comparing the results
in the two supercells, the formation energy difference is less than
0.15 eV. For instance, the formation energy of the type I Li vacancy
in the 2 × 1 × 1 supercell is 3.55 eV, while it is 3.41
eV in the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell. These results further validate
the reliability of our theoretical model. On top of this, the obtained
formation energies of three types of Li vacancies are 3.55, 3.40,
and 3.40 eV, respectively.

Same as in the previous section,
the adsorption properties of tritium
in the vacancies are studied first. In each vacancy, the dangling
bond of the O atoms generated by removing the Li atom will be the
best adsorption sites for the T atom. Hence, there are six adsorption
sites in each type of vacancy.

As shown in Figure 3b,c, each Li vacancy is actually
an octahedron composed of six O
atoms with dangling bonds. The obtained adsorption energies of T at
six sites in each type of Li vacancy are very close to each other,
which vary from −4.85 to −4.60 eV. At the same time,
in all cases, the optimized T–O bond length is 0.98 Å,
with differences of less than 0.01 Å, and all of the T–O
bonds point toward the approximate center of the Li vacancy. This
indicates the strong adsorption of the tritium atom in the vacancies.
The results predict that the lithium vacancies in Li3TaO4 have similar tritium-trapping capabilities.

Next, we
use NEB calculations to probe the tritium diffusion inside
each type of Li vacancy of the Li3TaO4 crystal,
respectively. The lowest energy barriers for all of the tritium-diffusion
pathways inside each type of Li vacancy are listed in Table 2.

Table 2 Lowest Energy Barrier for 15 Types
of Tritium-Diffusion Pathways inside Each Type of Li Vacancy
 	 	energy
barrier (eV)	
path	pathway	type I	type II	type III	
path 1	site 1–4	0.63	0.75	0.68	
path 2	site 1–6	1.09	0.75	0.59	
path 3	site 1–3	0.57	1.18	0.39	
path 4	site 1–5	0.66	0.65	0.94	
path 5	site 2–4	0.72	0.56	0.82	
path 6	site 2–6	0.49	0.65	0.60	
path 7	site 2–3	0.45	0.48	0.97	
path 8	site 2–5	0.73	1.29	0.61	
path 9	site 4–6	0.55	0.40	1.21	
path 10	site 6–3	0.45	0.99	0.47	
path 11	site 3–5	0.54	0.58	0.59	
path 12	site 5–4	1.11	0.65	0.66	
path 13	site 1–2	2.49	3.07	3.06	
path 14	site 3–4	2.58	3.09	3.06	
path 15	site 5–6	2.34	2.99	3.06	
For instance, path 1 in Table 2 is related to the pathway from the adsorption
site
1 to the adsorption site 4 in the Li vacancy as shown in Figure 3c. Path 9 inside
a type II Li vacancy has been illustrated in Figure 3b, which corresponds to the tritium diffusion
from site 4 to site 6. For each type of Li vacancy, 15 diffusion pathways
have been calculated. Paths 1–12 called “edge paths”
are pathways along the edge of the octahedral vacancy, while paths
13–15 called “diagonal paths” are along the diagonal
direction of the octahedral vacancy. These 15 pathways encompass all
cases when T diffuses inside the Li vacancy.

The energy barriers
of the three diagonal paths (paths 13–15)
in each type of vacancy are much higher than those of the edge paths.
This fact means that tritium prefers to move along the edge of the
octahedron when diffusing inside the vacancy. The energy barrier difference
in different paths is probably related to the lengths of the paths.
The mean pathway length of the edge paths is 1.85 Å, while the
average diagonal pathway length is 2.5 Å. This fact is consistent
with the results in the previous section.

Furthermore, it must
be considered that a diffusion pathway with
a high energy barrier could be achieved by combining diffusion paths
with lower energy barriers. For example, the pathway of path 12 is
from site 5 to site 4, and its corresponding energy barrier in the
type I Li vacancy is 1.11 eV in Table 2. This pathway could be achieved by combining path
8 (site 2–5) and path 5 (site 2–4), which reduces the
energy barrier to 0.73 eV.

Generally, we could obtain that the
minimum energy barrier of all
of the diffusion paths inside each type of vacancy as 0.45, 0.40,
and 0.39 eV, respectively. Therefore, it is found that the diffusion
behavior of the T atom moving inside the Li vacancy is similar to
that in the crystal, namely, the T atom can move easily in the crystal
or inside the vacancies.

3.3 Tritium Hopping out of the Li Vacancy of Li3TaO4
Only the diffusion behavior of T
in the perfect crystal and inside the Li vacancies does not fully
describe the diffusion process of T in Li3TaO4. How a T atom jumps out of a Li vacancy is a fundamental problem,
which will be discussed subsequently. In this section, we calculate
the energy barrier of a T atom diffusing from the adsorption site
inside the Li vacancy to the adsorption site outside the Li vacancy
to understand how the tritium atom escapes from the vacancy.

Preliminary tests have shown that the tritium atom is always adsorbed
to the oxygen atom after geometry optimization. We find that there
are eight saturated O atoms close to the Li vacancy in the crystal,
which are called “edge O atoms” and plotted as purple
balls in Figure 4.
The tritium adsorption energies at eight edge O atoms are from −4.22
to −3.99 eV, and the energy differences in three types of Li
vacancies do not exceed 0.23 eV. After a careful comparison of the
local density of states, it is found that these eight edge O atoms
have the same properties as the saturated O atoms in the perfect Li3TaO4 crystal. Therefore, the process of T atom
hopping out of the Li vacancy is actually the process in which the
T atom diffuses from the O adsorption site with a dangling bond inside
the vacancy to the adsorption site of the saturated edge O atoms close
to the vacancy.

Figure 4 (a) Primitive cell of the defect model of a Li3TaO4 crystal with a type II lithium vacancy. (b) Structure
formed
around the Li vacancy. (c) Sketch map of the quasi-cubic cage formed
by eight edge O atoms.

In Figure 4b, the
structure formed around the Li vacancy is plotted, in which the eight
purple edge O atoms form a quasi-cubic cage and the six black O atoms
with dangling bonds are present at positions close to the face center
of the cage. Each edge O atom has three nearest-neighboring O atoms
with dangling bonds, namely three nearest-neighboring O atoms inside
the Li vacancy. Therefore, there are 24 possible diffusion pathways
for each Li vacancy. All of these possible diffusion pathways are
calculated, and the related results are given in Table 3. Path 19 with a type II Li vacancy in Table 3 corresponds to the pathway from the edge
O atom 7 to the adsorption site 1, which has been plotted in Figure 4a.

The results in Table 3 show that among the three types of Li vacancies, the
minimum energy
barriers for tritium jumping out the vacancy are 0.72, 0.70, and 0.51
eV, respectively. This indicates that the energy barrier that the
T atom needs to jump out of the vacancy is a bit higher than the barrier
for the T atom to diffuse in the crystal or inside the vacancy. It
is easier for tritium to escape from the trap of a type III Li vacancy
compared with other vacancies.

3.4 Diffusion Coefficient
The diffusion
coefficient is further investigated to reveal the tritium-diffusion
behavior in the Li3TaO4 crystal. According to
the previous study of the γ-LiAlO2 crystal, the diffusion
coefficient D can be written as follows23,24 3  where l is the migration
distance, namely the length of the diffusion path; R0 is the attempt frequency; Z = 6 is
the coordination number; Eα is the
activation energy barrier; KB is the Boltzmann
constant; and T is the temperature. According to
the theory of Wert and Zener, R0 can be
written as37,38 4  and the diffusion coefficient can be written
as 5  To confirm the accuracy of this equation,
the diffusion coefficients in the previous study23 have been calculated, and the results are consistent with
it in the order of magnitude. Therefore, based on our calculated l and Eα, the diffusion
coefficient versus T for the perfect and defect models
of the Li3TaO4 crystal are then obtained by eq 5, which have been illustrated
in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Diffusion coefficient
for the perfect and defect models of the
Li3TaO4 crystal.

The curve with solid black squares in Figure 5 is the result for
tritium diffusing in the
perfect crystal, the curve with red circles corresponds to the result
for tritium diffusing inside the type III Li vacancy, and the curve
with solid blue triangles is related to the result for tritium hopping
out of the type III Li vacancy. The two vertical dashed lines mark
the two corresponding temperatures, 300 and 600 K, respectively.

As shown in Figure 5, the tritium diffusion coefficient D at 300 K in
the perfect crystal is much higher than those of the other two cases.
However, as the temperature increases, the magnitude difference of
the diffusion coefficient for the three curves is significantly reduced.
The summary of tritium activation energy barriers, migration distances,
and diffusion coefficients is presented in Table 4.

The detailed data in the above table have further
presented that
tritium prefers to diffuse in the type III Li vacancy because the
corresponding diffusion coefficients are lower in contrast to the
other two vacancies. This may due to the fact that tritium is easier
to escape from the trap of the type III Li vacancy compared with the
other vacancies in the previous section.

Besides, we compare
our results with those of other lithium ceramic
materials. In the latest theoretical study,23,24 the smallest activation energy barrier inside the Li vacancy is
0.3 eV for Li2ZrO3 and 0.63 eV for γ-LiAlO2, while our result is 0.39 eV in a type III Li vacancy of
Li3TaO4. The tritium diffusion coefficients
at 600 K are approximately 10–9, 10–12, and 10–10 m2/s in the above three
types of crystals correspondingly.23,24 In the previous
experimental study, the observed order of tritium diffusion coefficients
in different lithium ceramic materials was D (Li8ZrO6) ≈ D (Li4SiO4) > D (Li2O) > D (Li2ZrO3) > D (Li2SiO3) > D (γ-LiAlO2).39 Thus, from this point of view,
we
believe that Li3TaO4 could act as a potential
tritium breeder, and the diffusion energy barrier of tritium in the
Li3TaO4 crystal is not the major factor for
preventing tritium release.

4 Summary
In this work, the diffusion
behavior of a tritium atom in the perfect
and the defect Li3TaO4 crystals has been thoroughly
investigated using density functional theory calculations. All of
the diffusion pathways when tritium is diffusing in the perfect crystal,
inside the three types of Li vacancies, and hopping out of the vacancies
have been studied in detail. The obtained minimum energy barrier for
tritium diffusing in the perfect crystal is 0.34 eV, while it is 0.39
eV for tritium diffusing inside the Li vacancies and 0.51 eV for tritium
hopping out of the Li vacancies. By further investigation, we reveal
that energy barriers for the different pathways are influenced by
the pathway length, which is related to the T–O interaction
during the diffusion.

Considering both the energy barrier and
the pathway length, the
tritium diffusion coefficients are finally calculated and analyzed.
We find that it is relatively hard for tritium to escape from the
Li vacancy at room temperature, but this situation will be greatly
alleviated as the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient increases
when the temperature increases. In contrast to the previous study
of LiAlO2 crystals, our obtained diffusion coefficients
are basically higher, which is beneficial to the tritium diffusion
and release process. Our results could further help understand the
experiments and provide support for the use of Li3TaO4 as breeder materials.
