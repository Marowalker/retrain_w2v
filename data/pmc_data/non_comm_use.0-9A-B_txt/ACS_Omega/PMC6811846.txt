Graphene-like g-C3N4 nanosheets (NSs) have
been successfully synthesized with a modified polymerization process
of melamine by cocondensation with volatile salts. Volatile ammonium
salts such as urea–NH4Cl/(NH4)2SO4/(NH4)3PO4 were added
with melamine to modulate the thermodynamic process during polymerization
and optimize the structure formation in situ. The surface area, surface
structure, and surface charge state of the obtained g-C3N4 NSs could be controlled by simply adjusting the mass
ratio of the melamine/volatile ammonium salt. As a consequence, the
g-C3N4 NSs exhibited much higher activity than
bulk g-C3N4 for the photocatalytic degradation
of target pollutants (rhodamine B, methylene blue, and methyl orange),
and it also exhibited greater hydrogen evolution under visible light
irradiation with an optimal melamine/volatile ammonium salt ratio.
The as-prepared g-C3N4 NSs with melamine–urea–NH4Cl showed the highest visible light photocatalytic H2 production activity of 1853.8 μmol·h–1·g–1, which is 9.4 times higher than that
of bulk g-C3N4 from melamine. The present study
reveals that the synergistic effect of the enhanced surface area,
surface structure, and surface charge state is the key for the enhancement
of photocatalytic degradation and hydrogen evolution, which could
be controlled by the proposed strategy. The result is a good explanation
for the hypothesis that adding properly selected monomers can truly
regulate the polymerization process of melamine, which is beneficial
for obtaining g-C3N4 NSs without molecular self-assembly.
Considering the inexpensive feedstocks used, a simple synthetic controlling
method provides an opportunity for the rational design and synthesis,
making it decidedly appealing for large-scale production of highly
photocatalytic, visible-sensitizable, metal-free g-C3N4 photocatalysts.

1 Introduction
Graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is one of
the most promising photocatalysts and has gained much more attention
because of its high chemical stability, appealing electronic band
gap, and optical features as a metal-free, visible-light-driven semiconductor
photocatalyst for solar energy conversion and environmental remediation.1−5 However, bulk g-C3N4 still suffers from low
surface area and high recombination rate of photogenerated electrons
and holes, which result in low photocatalytic activity.6,7 Much effort has been made to enhance the photocatalytic activity
of g-C3N4, including doping with heteroatoms,8−11 compositing with other semiconductors and controlling morphology.12−15 Nevertheless, a simple development of highly efficient g-C3N4 still remains a significant challenge.16,17

Porous or nanosheet (NS) structures possess higher surface
area
and improved mass transferability compared to other types of photocatalysts,
which is favorable for enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency of
g-C3N4. Presently, different approaches have
been developed to prepare porous g-C3N4, and
hard-template or soft-template approaches are the two classic ways
to achieve this goal.18 Although the soft-
and hard-template methods have achieved good results in controlling
the shape, there are also some problems. For hard-template approaches,
some hazardous and poisonous substances such as hydrogen fluoride
(HF) and aqueous ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2) have been used to remove the silica template. On the other hand,
using conventional surfactants has required complicated post-treatments
and the residual carbon species were hard to completely remove, which
may influence the photocatalytic activity.19

Supramolecular chemistry provides a great opportunity for
the synthesis
of nanostructured materials without any further templating techniques.20 The structure of the final product can be controlled
by choosing the appropriate monomers and solvents for the synthesis.
Supramolecular aggregates of melamine with cyanuric acid,21,22 oxalic acid,23,24 barbituric acid,25 cyanuric acid and barbituric acid,26,27 cyanuric acid and urea,28 cyanuric acid
and ethylene glycol,29 or hydrogen peroxide
and ammonium chloride,30 connected by hydrogen
bonds, have been adopted to prepare nanostructured g-C3N4. A diverse morphology containing an ordered structure
and a relatively higher surface area with enhanced photocatalytic
performance by molecular self-assembly has become a hot topic. However,
the additive monomers and solvents or the supramolecular structure
itself may modify the polycondensation process, and the chemical structure
of g-C3N4 was rarely of concern or discussed.
To simplify the system and focus on the role of the monomer itself
in the polycondensation process and the chemical structure, monomers
without molecular self-assembly are needed. A hypothesis made herein
was that g-C3N4 with various morphologies and
surface charge states toward high photocatalytic performance would
be created through cocondensation of melamine with volatile salts.
The volatile salts could modify the polymerization process of melamine
by the bubbles that are generated at different stages of polymerization
through decomposition of the additive volatile salts and without molecular
self-assembly.

We hypothesized that if the decomposition of
volatile salts could
be in combination with the polymerization process of melamine and
bubbles can be generated at different stages of polymerization, then
g-C3N4 with different surface areas or different
surface structures should be obtained. To achieve this goal, designing
mixed volatile salts with different decomposition temperatures is
a critical step. Under prepolymerization of melamine at a lower temperature,
the volatile salt melts to exhibit flow dynamics and begins to partially
decompose, creating bubbles that could promote sufficient mixing of
the entire system and expand the prepolymerized precursor. Then, with
the continued polymerization of melamine at a higher temperature,
the viscosity of the system is further increased, and the volatile
salts encapsulated in the prepolymerization precursor with high decomposition
temperature begin to decompose to generate bubbles, which can effectively
avoid agglomeration of melamine in the high-temperature polymerization
process. Then, g-C3N4 with a large specific
surface area and different surface structures could be obtained. The
mixture of melamine–urea–inorganic ammonium salt was
chosen as the target system. In addition, the volatilization of urea
and ammonium ions can avoid the unnecessary metal-ion doping to the
structure. The melting points and decomposition temperatures of urea
and inorganic ammonium salt are different, which can effectively regulate
the polymerization process of melamine. In addition, the volatile
and decomposable properties of urea and inorganic ammonium salt can
also serve as gas bubble templates, which is favorable for producing
a higher surface area. As a consequence, the in situ method of cocondensation
of melamine and volatilized ammonium salt to modulate the thermodynamic
process during polymerization and optimize the structure is proposed.

Herein, we report a facile one-step method for the synergic achievement
of large-quantity and high-quality g-C3N4 NSs
by in situ polymerization of melamine–urea–inorganic
ammonium salt. Urea and volatile inorganic ammonium salts (NH4Cl, (NH4)2SO4, and (NH4)3PO4) were used as the additive monomers
that can modify the polycondensation process by faster mass transfer
and serve as the bubble template. The bubbles from the decomposition
of the additive volatile salts can continuously release gas such as
NH3(g),31 SO2(g),32 HCl(g),33 and H2O(g) during the polymerization process of melamine. The surface
area, surface structure, and surface charge state of g-C3N4 can be controlled by adjusting the mass ratio of the
melamine/volatile molten salt and the calculated temperature. The
g-C3N4 NSs synthesized by this method possessed
enhanced specific surface area and achieved improved electron transportability
as well as an efficient separation rate of electrons and holes. The
g-C3N4 NSs exhibit much higher activity than
bulk g-C3N4 in the photocatalytic degradation
of the target pollutants [rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB),
and methyl orange (MO)] and hydrogen evolution under visible light
irradiation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure and Morphology of Photocatalysts
Powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis was used to investigate
the crystal structure of the obtained g-C3N4-M-550, g-C3N4-M-600, g-C3N4-M-U-600, g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600, g-C3N4-M-U-S-600, and g-C3N4-M-U-P-600
(shown in Figure 1).
From Figure 1, it can
be seen that two obvious peaks were observed in all samples. The strongest
XRD peak (002) is at approximately 27.3°, which is attributable
to the interplanar stacking peak of aromatic systems. The lower-angle
reflection peak at 13.0° is derived from the lattice planes parallel
to the c-axis.34 It is
clear that the (002) peak intensity of g-C3N4-M-U-600, g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600, g-C3N4-M-U-S-600, and g-C3N4-M-U-P-600
clearly are weaker, compared with that of g-C3N4-M-550 and g-C3N4-M-600. In addition, the (002)
peak position slightly shifts toward a higher angle, which could be
attributed to the creation of the porous structure or the NS structure
observed in g-C3N4 by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis.18 The thermogravimetric (TG)–differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve of melamine and melamine–urea–NH4Cl is shown in Figure 2. In the DSC curve of melamine, the strongest endothermic
peak, at approximately 321 °C, corresponds to the sublimation
and thermal condensation of melamine.35 For melamine–urea–NH4Cl, about four strong
endothermic peaks appeared from 109 to 368 °C. Furthermore, the
TG analysis has been performed to illustrate the thermal behaviors
of melamine and melamine–urea–NH4Cl, as displayed
in Figure 2. For melamine,
it experiences most of the weight loss from 295 to 325 °C and
shows a single weight loss step. However, the curve of melamine–urea–NH4Cl shows the most weight loss from 197 to 375 °C and
presents multiple weight loss steps along the entire TG process, corresponding
to the continuous decomposition of the mixed precursor. A strong endothermic
peak appeared at 109 °C with nearly no weight loss from the TG
and DSC curve of melamine–urea–NH4Cl, indicating
melting of the mixture. The TG–DSC curve of melamine–urea,
melamine–urea–(NH4)2SO4, and melamine–urea–(NH4)3PO4 is also shown in Figure S1. It
is clearly shown that when the temperature ranges from 200 to 360
°C, nearly no obvious endothermic peaks appeared, which indicates
that the added (NH4)2SO4, (NH4)3PO4 salt cannot regulate the polymerization
process of melamine during this stage. Besides, the exothermic peaks
in the DSC curve of melamine–urea–(NH4)2SO4 or melamine–urea–(NH4)3PO4 at higher temperature may indicate part
of the g-C3N4 local structure self-combustion
decomposition reaction (shown in Figure S1).

the mixture.

The pore structure and N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of the as-prepared bulk g-C3N4 and
g-C3N4 NSs are shown in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3 and Table 1, g-C3N4-M-U-600, g-C3N4-M-U-S-600, and g-C3N4-M-U-P-600
exhibited an increased specific surface area (72.8, 53.5, and 47.4
m2/g, respectively) compared to bulk g-C3N4-M-550 (10.8 m2/g) and g-C3N4-M-600 (22.2 m2/g). Further, the specific surface area
of g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600 increased to 103.3 m2/g, which was 9.6, 4.7, 3.5, and 1.4 times higher than the
values of bulk g-C3N4-M-550, g-C3N4-M-600, g-C3N4-M-Cl-600, and g-C3N4-M-U-600, respectively. However, the specific
surface areas of g-C3N4-M-U-S-600 and g-C3N4-M-U-P-600 were lower than g-C3N4-M-U-600, which indicates that the properly selected monomer
is important for the improved surface area. Compared with the other
three samples, g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600 has a larger
specific surface area, which is reasonable. According to TG characterizations,
in the system of melamine–urea–NH4Cl mixture,
the decompositions mainly occurred in the temperature range between
200 and 360 °C. Because melamine polymerizes in this temperature
range, similar to a polymerization foaming process, the gases produced
by the decompositions should help to form bubbles in the system and
thus increase the specific surface area. However, also according to
the TG characterizations, in the other three systems, the decompositions
took place mainly in the temperature range between 400 and 550 °C,
when the melamine polymerization was largely finished and the melamine
polymer solidified. Therefore, it is imaginable that the gases formed
in the high temperature range have limited effects on the specific
surface area. The surface area of g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600
was as large as that of g-C3N4 obtained by the
supramolecular aggregates method (shown in Table 2).32,33,36 As a consequence, the cocondensation of melamine and volatilized
ammonium salt to modulate the thermodynamic process during polymerization
and optimize the structure by the in situ method was successful. In
addition, the raw materials were cheaper to obtain and easier to control
during the polymerization process of melamine compared with the supramolecular
aggregates method. This kind of enhancement reflects that a synergistic
effect could be obtained by selecting two suitable volatilized ammonium
salts that can serve as bubble-forming agents simultaneously. The
synergistic effect most likely resulted from the generation of gas
bubbles containing nitrogen oxides,17 NH3, and H2O16 continuously
that can then modify the polycondensation process of melamine.

The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared bulk g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 NSs samples
were characterized by TEM. As shown in Figure 4a–e, bulk g-C3N4 possesses dense and thick layers to construct a massive two-dimensional
sheetlike structure (Figure 4a,b), while the urea and inorganic ammonium salt as gas bubble-assisted
g-C3N4 NSs show a flaky structure with bubble-like
or irregular morphology and a significant decrease in thickness, as
shown in Figure 4c–f.
The TEM image of g-C3N4-M-U-600 in Figure 4c shows the characteristics
of a crinkly structure. This kind of crinkly structure could be preserved,
and a typical ultrathin NS-like architecture with a crinkly structure
could be observed for g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600 (Figure 4d). This phenomenon
was reasonable because of the continuous gases emitted during the
formation of g-C3N4 NSs with urea–inorganic
ammonium salt as the additive monomers. These results suggest that
large-scale thin g-C3N4 NSs with crinkly structures
were successfully prepared by the modified polymerization process
of melamine with urea–inorganic ammonium salt as the additive
monomer.

(e) g-C3N4-M-U-S-600, and (f) g-C3N4-M-U-P-600.

The proposed formation process of multistage polymerization design
for g-C3N4 NSs is showing in Figure 5. In the prepolymerization
of melamine–urea–NH4Cl at the lower temperature,
the volatile urea melts to exhibit flow dynamics and then partially
decomposes, creating bubbles that could promote sufficient mixing
of the entire system and expand the prepolymerized precursor. Then,
with the continued polymerization of melamine at a higher temperature,
the viscosity of the system is further increased, and NH4Cl encapsulated in the prepolymerization precursor with higher decomposition
temperature begins to decompose to generate bubbles, which can effectively
avoid the agglomeration of melamine in the higher-temperature polymerization
process. Then, the g-C3N4 NSs could be obtained.

formation process of multistage polymerization design

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried
out to reveal the surface chemical compositions of the obtained materials
and are shown in Figure 6a–d. The XPS survey spectrum in Figure 6a shows that the g-C3N4-M-550, g-C3N4-M-600, g-C3N4-M-U-600, g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600, and g-C3N4-M-U-S-600 samples contain only C, N, and O species
without other impurities, while g-C3N4-M-U-P-600
contains only C, N, P, and O species, which indicates that P could
be introduced. For the C 1s spectra (Figure 6b), most of the samples showed similar two
characteristic peaks located at 284.7 and 288.0 eV. The peak at 284.7
eV can be attributed to the signal of carbon impurities.38 The main peak with a binding energy of 288.0
eV can be identified as an sp2-hybridized carbon in an
N-containing aromatic ring (N–C=N).39 In addition, there is a higher peak located at 288.5 eV
in the C 1s spectrum for g-C3N4-M-U-P-600, which
is attributed to O–C=O.40 From the N 1s spectrum (Figure 6c), it can be seen that the major peak is located at
398.7 or 399 eV. The major peak located at 398.7 eV is assigned to
sp2-hybridized nitrogen in C-containing triazine rings
(C–N=C), whereas the peak at 399.0 eV is usually attributed
to the tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3 groups.38 The P 2p signal (Figure 6d) can be deconvoluted into three peaks located
at approximately 133.3, 134, and 134.9 eV, respectively. The peaks
at 133.3 and 134 eV are typical for P–N species,41,42 which indicates that the P atoms may replace C atoms in the C–N
framework of g-C3N4. The peaks at 133.3 and
134 eV can be attributed to the P–N and P=N bonds, respectively.38 In comparison, the peak at 134.9 eV can be correlated
with the P=O bond because of the reaction between P and O2 during the copolymerization reaction in air at high temperature,
which is generally denoted as P2O5 in the literature.43 The carbon and nitrogen XPS analyses further
confirm the triazine or triazine heterocyclic ring structure of the
obtained samples.

spectra, (c) N 1s spectra, and (d) P 2p spectra.

The Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectra are shown in Figure 7. In the spectrum
of the obtained g-C3N4 samples, three characteristic
bands were found similar to that of the typical g-C3N4 structure from the previous reports.44−46 The absorption
peak at 808 cm–1 corresponds to the characteristic
breathing mode of triazine units,44 while
the strong band at 1200–1600 cm–1 is associated
with the stretching vibration of the C–N and C=N heterocycles.45 The broad absorption peak in the region of 3000–3500
cm–1 is attributed to the stretching vibrations
of terminal N–H or N–H2 originated from uncondensed
amino groups.46 The peak centered at 980
cm–1 is clearly observed in the spectra of g-C3N4-M-U-P-600. This peak is assigned to the P–N
stretching mode or vibration mode, which suggests that phosphorus
atoms are doped into the crystal lattice of g-C3N4 successfully.47,48 The vibrations of the P-related
group were hardly observed in previous investigations, and when they
were observed, they were attributed to either the low phosphorus content
or an overlapping of its vibration by the C–N bond. The observed
obvious P–N-related peak indicates that a higher concentration
of P-doped g-C3N4 could be obtained by our method.
In addition, there is a distinct adsorption peak at 2170 cm–1 in g-C3N4-M-U-P-600 corresponding to the defects
of cyano group stretch caused by the incomplete polymerization and
the loss of ammonia, which indicates that the cyano groups were successfully
introduced into g-C3N4-M-U-P-600.49,50 The cyano groups were detected only in the FTIR of g-C3N4-M-U-P-600 that was prepared by melamine–urea–ammonium
phosphate, which indicates that the introduction of cyano groups is
related to the phosphate ions in (NH4)3PO4. This is the first report that the cyano groups can be introduced
by a phosphate anion, which is different from previously reported
cyano groups that were formed by cations such as Na+ or
K+ from NaCl or KCl/LiCl molten salt.49,50

2.2 Optical and Photoelectrochemical
Properties
of the g-C3N4 Samples
The optical property
of the obtained g-C3N4 samples were analyzed
by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra. As shown in Figure 8a, it can be clearly
observed that all of the samples had a strong absorption from UV to
visible wavelengths. Compared to the bulk g-C3N4-M-550 or g-C3N4-M-600, the absorption edges
of the g-C3N4 samples (g-C3N4-M-U-600, g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600, g-C3N4-M-U-S-600, and g-C3N4-M-U-P-600)
exhibited a systematically slight blue shift with the added urea and
volatile inorganic ammonium salt. Accordingly, the band gap energies
of g-C3N4-M-550, g-C3N4-M-600, g-C3N4-M-U-600, g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600, g-C3N4-M-U-S-600, and g-C3N4-M-U-P-600 were determined to be 2.55, 2.57,
2.71, 2.78, 2.68, and 2.65 eV, respectively (Figure 8b). This kind of blue-shift performance of
g-C3N4 NSs can presumably be ascribed to its
nanoporous or NS structure, which can result from the quantum confinement
effect.51,52

the as-prepared samples’
(a,b) relationship between (Ahν)1/2 vs (hν) for the band gap energy of g-C3N4 samples.

The charge carrier’s separation abilities of as-synthesized
samples were monitored by photoluminescence (PL) analysis. As depicted
in Figure 9a, it can
be observed that an obvious decrease can be observed with g-C3N4 by adding urea and a volatile inorganic ammonium
salt, which may be caused by the different structure. The g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600 and g-C3N4-M-U-P-600
samples exhibited the lowest PL emission intensity. Generally, the
lower PL intensity indicates a decrease in the recombination of photoinduced
electrons and holes.52 Therefore, the lower
PL emission intensity of g-C3N4 NSs is probably
related to the introduced surface defects, porous structure, and thin
NSs,18,53 which can improve the charge carrier transfer
rate and benefit the improvement of photocatalytic activity. For g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600, the thin NSs structure may reduce
the carrier diffusion distance and thus decrease the possibility of
recombination of the photoinduced electrons and holes. However, for
g-C3N4-M-U-P-600, the cyano groups were introduced
to the structure and the cyano groups as an electron-withdrawing group
may affect the surface charge distribution of the catalyst and then
inhibit photoinduced carrier recombination to some extent. From this
point of view, it is reasonable for the above two samples (g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600 and g-C3N4-M-U-P-600)
to own the lowest PL emission intensity.

the excited wavelength was 330 nm. (b)

400
nm) at 0.0 V vs SCE electrode.

Furthermore, the charge carrier transfer process and visible light
response were sequentially probed by transient photocurrent–time
plots. As shown in Figure 9b, all the samples exhibit a sensitive photocurrent response
under visible light illumination. In the first on–off switch,
the g-C3N4 samples prepared by adding urea and
a volatile inorganic ammonium salt show the higher photocurrent compared
with that of the bulk g-C3N4-M-550 or g-C3N4-M-600. When the on–off switch was operated
for a longer time, g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600 shows the
highest photocurrent, which is 4.4 times higher than that of g-C3N4-M-550. This observation indicates more efficient
transportation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs on g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600 than on that of bulk g-C3N4, which contributed to the enhanced photocatalytic activity.

2.3 Photocatalytic Activity of the g-C3N4 Samples
The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4-M-550, g-C3N4-M-600, g-C3N4-M-U-600, g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600,
g-C3N4-M-U-S-600, and g-C3N4-M-U-P-600 was evaluated by the degradation of RhB (20 ppm), MO (10
ppm), and MB (15 ppm), which are the hazardous dyes, under visible
light irradiation. As the prepared catalyst has different adsorption
characteristics for different dyes, the adsorption capacity for RhB,
MB, and MO is sequentially decreased. In order to maintain the concentration
of the system after adsorption, different initial concentrations are
set. In the process of comparison, each of the catalyst has been used
to test the degradation ability of the above three dyes. For a certain
catalyst prepared in the present study, it has different adsorption
capacities for different dyes, RhB, MB, and MO. To fix the effective
concentration of different types of dyes after the adsorption by the
catalyst, different initial concentrations of RhB, MB, and MO dyes
are used. However, for a certain dye of the three dyes, the initial
concentrations for the different catalysts are the same. Actually,
the relative catalytic activity of a certain catalyst was determined
by comparing the degradation activities of the different catalysts
for the same dye at the same concentration. Figure 10a shows the photodegradation of RhB solutions
of g-C3N4 obtained with different urea and volatile
inorganic ammonium salts under visible light irradiation. The RhB
solutions containing g-C3N4 NSs underwent significant
degradation and became nearly transparent within 50 min (shown in Figure 10a). It should be
noted that the sample g-C3N4-M-U-P-600 showed
the highest photocatalytic oxidation on RhB. After only 20 min of
irradiation with visible light, approximately 96% RhB was already
degraded by the catalyst (g-C3N4-M-U-P-600),
as shown in Figure 10a. However, the bulk g-C3N4 obtained without
adding any urea or volatile inorganic ammonium salt showed poorer
photocatalytic activity, only about 19 and 31% of RhB was degraded
by g-C3N4-M-550 and g-C3N4-M-600, respectively. The original strategy of adding urea and a
volatile inorganic ammonium salt into melamine to enhance the photocatalytic
was successful.

light irradiation in neutral suspension, (a) 20 ppm RhB, (b) 10 ppm
MO, (c) 15 ppm MB, and (d) removal efficiency of different dyes by
adsorption.

To further confirm whether the
obtained sample has a similar activity
for degradation of other dyes, we also compared the photocatalytic
activity of the degradation of MO and MB (shown in Figure 10b,c). Surprisingly, the trend
is not the same; it even showed opposite changes. For MO degradation,
g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600 showed the highest photocatalytic
activity. After 100 min of illumination under visible light, nearly
78% of MO was degraded by g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600.
However, the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4-M-U-P-600 was reduced to the same level of pure g-C3N4 (g-C3N4-M-550 or g-C3N4-M-600); approximately 53 and 46% MO were degraded by g-C3N4-M-U-P-600 and g-C3N4-M-600,
respectively. For MB degradation, g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600
still showed the highest photocatalytic activity, and approximately
98% of the MB was eliminated after 50 min. However, the photocatalytic
activity of g-C3N4-M-U-P-600 still decreased
to the same level of g-C3N4-M-600 and approximately
67% MB was degraded after 50 min.

This anomalous phenomenon
prompted us to think more deeply about
the reasons that led to this phenomenon. We realized that to explain
this phenomenon, we needed to consider the combination of the nature
of the dye itself, the specific surface area of the catalyst, and
its surface charge state. There is a mutual correlation between the
three factors and even the constraints. From the dye itself, we know
that MB, RhB, and MO typically represent the cationic dye, the amphoteric
dye, and the anionic dye, respectively. Therefore, the surface charge
state of the catalyst may affect the adsorption and degradation properties
of different types of dyes.

In general, high surface areas can
endow the catalysts with more
available active adsorption sites, thus resulting in a better adsorption
performance. The dye adsorption property of the obtained g-C3N4 NSs was investigated by removing the cationic dye MB,
the amphoteric dye RhB, and the anionic dye MO molecules from water
under dark conditions, and the results are shown in Figure 9d. In theory, the physical
adsorption of a dye by the surface of the catalyst should be similar
for different dyes if the surface area is similar. However, from Figure 10d, we can see that
significant differences exist for the different dyes. For example,
the BET surface area of g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600 is
2 times higher than that of g-C3N4-M-U-P-600.
However, the two samples show similar adsorption characteristics for
MB (77 and 68% at 30 min, respectively), while showing different trends
for RhB and MO. Although the BET surface areas of g-C3N4-M-U-S-600 and g-C3N4-M-U-P-600 are
the same, they show the different adsorption characteristics for MB
(57 and 68% at 30 min, respectively). From the above discussion, we
may suppose that except for physical adsorption, other factors need
to be considered, such as electrostatic attractive interactions.

To distinguish the type of surface charge of the obtained samples,
a zeta potential test for all the samples was carried out in deionized
water. From the zeta potential, we know that the surface charge is
−13, −31, −29, −22, −23, and −38
mv for g-C3N4-M-550, g-C3N4-M-600, g-C3N4-M-U-600, g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600, g-C3N4-M-U-S-600, and g-C3N4-M-U-P-600, respectively (shown in Figure S2). The zeta potential of g-C3N4-M-U-P-600 was the most negative, which indicates that
the incorporation of the P atom has greatly changed the electronic
properties of g-C3N4. This is reasonable; when
the P atom is inserted into the framework, four of the five electrons
form covalent bonds with the N neighbors to adopt into the planar
structure. The remaining lone electron of the P atom will delocalize
into the p-conjugated triazine ring, thus creating an electron-rich
state of the P-doped g-C3N4.34,38 From the tested negative zeta potential, we may guess that electrostatic
interactions could be strengthened between the cationic dye (MB) or
the anionic dye (MO), which may promote adsorption for the cationic
dye (MB) and reduce adsorption for anionic dye (MO) by electrostatic
attraction or repulsion interaction. This conjecture is confirmed
by the adsorption performance shown in Figure 8d and appropriately explains the abnormalities
observed in the experiment. From the above discussions, it can be
concluded that the improved adsorption and degradation ability of
the obtained g-C3N4 composites results from
the synergy of the BET surface area and the surface charge state.

The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 NSs
was also investigated by evaluating photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
under visible light. As shown in Figure 11a, the hydrogen evolution rates of g-C3N4-M-550 and g-C3N4-M-600
are 197.7 and 432.0 μmol·h–1·g–1, respectively. After the addition of urea and volatile
inorganic ammonium salt, g-C3N4-M-U-600 (1395.4
μmol·h–1·g–1),
g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600 (1853.8 μmol·h–1·g–1), g-C3N4-M-U-S-600 (1167.8 μmol·h–1·g–1), and g-C3N4-M-U-P-600 (1193.7
μmol·h–1·g–1)
all displayed enhanced H2 evolution activity that is greater
than that of g-C3N4-M-550 or g-C3N4-M-600. The g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600
sample showed the highest H2 evolution rate of 1853.8 μmol·h–1·g–1, which was 9.4 times higher
than that of g-C3N4-M-550. On the basis of the
above results, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 NSs can be ascribed to the synergetic effect of the
enhanced surface area, surface structure, and surface charge state.
From the above discussion, we know that both the synergy of BET surface
area and the surface charge should be considered for dye adsorption
and degradation. For hydrogen evolution, we find that the synergy
of the two still existed, and the BET surface area played a dominant
role.

Figure 11 (a) Photocatalytic H2 evolution as a function of reaction
time and (b) stability test of H2 evolution for g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600 under visible light for five circles.

Moreover, the hydrogen production rate over the
g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600 photocatalyst after constant
irradiation
for five cycles could be sustained, which shows good stability (Figure 11b). This high stability
without deterioration in the photocatalytic activity is indispensable
for practical applications of this photocatalyst.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, g-C3N4 NSs
that exhibit much
improved photocatalytic activity has been successfully synthesized
with the modified polymerization process of melamine by cocondensation
of melamine with volatile salts. The as-fabricated g-C3N4 NSs possessed high photocatalytic activity with variable
high specific surface areas and surface charge states, which can be
controlled by adjusting the mass ratio of urea–inorganic ammonium
salt and calcination temperature. The result is a good explanation
for the hypothesis that adding monomers can truly regulate the polymerization
process of melamine when there is no molecular self-assembly. Moreover,
the revelation of this phenomenon is that molecular self-assembly
is beneficial for the regulation of the ordered structure. However,
we also need to pay attention to the role of the additive monomers
and solvents; otherwise, the supramolecular structure itself may influence
the polycondensation process. With the properly selected monomer,
we can obtain excellent nanostructures of g-C3N4 by simply adjusting the polymerization process. Considering the
inexpensive feedstocks used and the simple synthetic controlling method
make it highly appealing for large-scale production of highly photocatalytic,
visible-sensitizable, metal-free g-C3N4 photocatalysts.
In addition, the obtained g-C3N4 NSs show good
stability and can be repeatedly used without significant reduction
in the photocatalytic activity.

All starting materials
were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Corp, P. R. China,
and used without further purification.

4.1.2 Synthesis
of g-C3N4 Photocatalysts
4.1.2.1 Synthesis of Bulk g-C3N4
Bulk
g-C3N4 was formed with
6 g of melamine. In a detailed experiment, 6 g of melamine was placed
into an alumina crucible with a cover and heated at 550 °C or
600 °C for 4 h in a semiclosed system with a ramp rate of 5 °C/min.
When the sample was cooled to room temperature, the sample was removed
from the muffle furnace. The obtained samples were called g-C3N4-M-550 or g-C3N4-M-600.

4.1.2.2 g-C3N4 NSs
g-C3N4 NSs were synthesized using 6 g of melamine,
10 g of urea, and 4 g of ammonium sulfate, which were called g-C3N4-M-U-S-600; g-C3N4 NSs
synthesized with 6 g of melamine, 15 g of urea, and 4 g of ammonium
phosphate were called g-C3N4-M-U-P-600; g-C3N4 NSs synthesized with 6 g of melamine, 15 g of
urea, and 4 g of ammonium chloride were called g-C3N4-M-U-Cl-600. In addition, the samples obtained with 6 g of
melamine and 15 g of urea, 4 g of ammonium sulfate, or 4 g of ammonium
chloride were called g-C3N4-M-U-600, g-C3N4-M-P-600, and g-C3N4-M-Cl-600,
respectively. The mixture was ground with an agate mortar. Then, the
mixture was put in an alumina crucible with a cover and heated at
600 °C for 4 h in air with a ramp rate of 5 °C/min. When
the sample was cooled to room temperature, it was removed from the
muffle furnace.

4.1.3 Material Characterization
Powder
XRD analysis was carried out using a Rigaku D/MAX 2500X X-ray powder
diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. TEM observations were conducted
on a JEOL-2010 electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200
kV. Zeta potentials of the samples dispersed in water were analyzed
by a Malvern zeta analyzer (ZS90-2026). XPS measurements were performed
on a PerkinElmer PHI 5000C ESCA with Al Kα radiation operated
at 250 W. BET-specific surface areas and porosity of the g-C3N4 samples were calculated based on nitrogen adsorption
isotherms measured at 77 K using a gas adsorption apparatus 3H-2000PS4.
The specific surface area was obtained by the BET method. Pore size
distribution (PSD) was calculated from the adsorption branch of the
isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model. Ultraviolet–visible
diffuse reflection spectra (UV–vis DRS, Cary Eclipse) were
recorded on an Agilent Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
in the range of 200–800 nm at room temperature. FTIR spectra
were recorded with KBr disks holding the powder sample with an FTIR
spectrometer (PE Spectrum Two). The PL spectra of the mesoporous g-C3N4 samples were examined at room temperature after
excitation with incident light of 330 nm by a spectrofluorophotometer
(Cary Eclipse), and the slit widths at the excitation and emission
of the spectroflurometer were 2.5 and 2.5 nm, respectively.

4.1.4 Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production
The photocatalytic
activities of bulk g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 NSs were compared by water splitting
for hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. Before the
hydrogen production, 6.4 mL of H2PtCl6 aqueous
(3 wt % Pt) solution, 20 mL of methanol, and 80 of mL deionized water
were combined. Then, 200 mg of the g-C3N4 sample
was added into the solution. Finally, the mixture was photo-reduced
in situ during the photocatalytic reaction for 1 h under full arc.
During the hydrogen production, 50 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed
ultrasonically in 100 mL of an aqueous solution containing 10 vol
% of triethanolamine solution as a sacrificial agent. Then, the system
was degassed, and the solution was agitated for 30 min. Next, the
solution was irradiated for 3 h with a 300 W xenon lamp (CEAULIGHT)
with a 400 nm cutoff filter. The gas was extracted every 30 min and
the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate was analyzed by a
GC-7900 (CEAULIGHT), using high-purity Ar as the carrier gas.

4.1.5 Photocatalytic Degradation Test
The photocatalytic
degradation test is also a way to evaluate the
photocatalytic properties of different samples. RhB (20 mg/L), MO
(10 mg/L), and MB (15 mg/L) were used as the target pollutants. In
each run, 100 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of the
target pollutant solutions. Prior to the photocatalytic degradation
test, the adsorption–desorption equilibrium was achieved by
stirring the mixture in a dark environment for 30 min (the dye adsorption
vs time in the dark condition of g-C3N4 shown
in Figure S3). A 300 W xenon lamp with
a 400 nm cutoff filter irradiated the dye solution for the purpose
of degradation. After a certain period of time, approximately 5 mL
of the suspension was removed for detection. The UV–visible
absorption spectra of the supernatant solution were analyzed by a
UV–visible spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2550).

4.1.6 Photoelectrochemical Measurements
Photoelectrochemical
measurements were performed using a PGSTAT204
(Metrohm) electrochemical analyzer, employing a three-electrode system
with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode.
A 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was employed
as the electrolyte. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp with a
400 nm cutoff filter. Then, 30 mg of samples was mixed with 1200 μL
of ethanol, 800 μL of isopropanol, and 100 μL of PEDOT:PSS
(Aladdin). The solution was then subjected to ultrasonication for
30 min. After 2 min, drops of the obtained solution were deposited
onto a clean fluorine-doped tin oxide glass electrode. Finally, the
electrodes were heated at 150 °C for 1 h under vacuum.
