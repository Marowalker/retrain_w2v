Biosynthesized nanoparticles are
gaining attention because of biologically
active plant secondary metabolites that help in green synthesis and
also due to their unique biological applications. This study reports
a facile, ecofriendly, reliable, and cost-effective synthesis of silver
nanoparticles using the aqueous leaf extract of Cucumis
prophetarum (C. prophetarum) and their antibacterial and antiproliferative activity. Silver
nanoparticles were biosynthesized using the aqueous leaf extract of C. prophetarum, which acted as a reducing and capping
agent. The biosynthesized C. prophetarum silver nanoparticles (Cp-AgNPs) were characterized using different
techniques, such as UV–visible spectroscopy, dynamic light
scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis (EDAX). Phytochemical analysis was performed to determine
the phytochemicals responsible for the reduction and capping of the
biosynthesized Cp-AgNPs. The antioxidant activity of the biosynthesized
nanoparticles was determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)
and 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assays. Their antibacterial
activity was checked against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) and Salmonella typhi (Gram-negative) bacteria. The biosynthesized nanoparticles showed
dosage-dependent inhibition activity with a significant zone of inhibition
and were more effective toward S. typhi as compared to S. aureus. Their antiproliferative
activity was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay on selected cancer cell lines. The IC50 values of Cp-AgNPs on A549, MDA-MB-231, HepG2, and MCF-7 were found
to be 105.8, 81.1, 94.2, and 65.6 μg/mL, respectively, and this
showed that the Cp-AgNPs were more potent toward MCF-7 as compared
to other cell lines used in this study. This work revealed that the
biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using C. prophetarum leaf extract were associated with good antibacterial activity and
antiproliferative potential against selected cancer cell lines. The
biosynthesized C. prophetarum AgNPs
can be further exploited as a potential candidate for antioxidant,
antibacterial, and anticancer agents.

Introduction
Nanotechnology has emerged as one of the
large and attractive areas
of research, offering unique features and extensive applications in
various sectors such as agriculture, food, and biomedicine.1 Properties associated with nanoparticles such
as their small size, large surface area to surface volume ratio, optical,
magnetic, chemical, and mechanical properties have made them candidates
for novel applications in the biomedical field as antibiotic, antioxidant,
and anticancer agents and are well documented.2 Nanoparticles of noble metals, such as silver, gold, platinum, copper,
zinc, titanium, and magnesium, have gained considerable attention
for biomedical applications due to their multifunctional theranostic
abilities.3 Even though chemical and physical
methods are employed in the synthesis of nanoparticles, they are associated
with hazardous chemicals exhibiting toxicity. Alternatively, plant-mediated
synthesis of metal nanoparticles is gaining attention because of the
low toxicity, cost effectiveness, ecofriendliness, and low time consumption.4 Further, plants are a good and easily available
source of bioactive plant secondary metabolites such as polysaccharides,
proteins, polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, tannins, alkaloids,
amines, ketones, and aldehydes, which act as reducing, stabilizing,
and capping agents in the conversion of metal ions to metal nanoparticles,
leading to the production of desirable nanoparticles with predefined
characteristics.5 Among various biosynthesized
metal nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have emerged as
the champion in the last two decades due to their unique biological,
chemical, and physical properties.6 Although
silver is toxic at higher concentrations, many studies have established
that a lower concentration of AgNO3 has higher chemical
stability, catalytic activity, biocompatibility, and intrinsic therapeutic
potential.7 Silver nanoparticles are reported
to have potential anticancer and antimicrobial activity.8 In fact, the slow and regulated release of silver
from silver nanoparticles is one of the most striking advantages of
these nanoparticles when compared with bulk metals and their salts.9 A combination of nanotechnology and traditional
medicine is the mantra of the new-age bio-nanoformulations.

Many studies have been done on the green synthesis of AgNPs using
leaves of plants, but biosynthesis of AgNPs using wild and indigenous
species exhibiting potential anticancer activity and antibacterial
activity has not been explored to a large extent. Cucurbitaceae are
herbaceous plants accounting for nearly 125 genera and more than 960
species, which include Cucurbita, Langenaria, Citrullus, Cucumis, and Momordica. This family is predominantly distributed throughout the tropic
and in temperate regions. Among the various plant families, the cucurbitaceae
family ranks the highest for a number and percentage of species used
as human food.10 Cucurbitacins found in
fruits exhibit potent anticancer activity against various cancer cell
lines.11 The diversity of cucurbitacin
activities, especially differential cytotoxicity toward renal, brain,
tumor, and melanoma cell lines, makes them potential species for further
exploration.12 With this background knowledge,
we have selected Cucumis prophetarum, commonly known as wild gourd or wild cucumber, which is associated
with potent medicinal properties. N-Trisaccharide
isolated from the aqueous extract of C. prophetarum fruits is known to possess antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and antidiabetic
properties.13 Along the same line of study,
we tried to explore the antibacterial and antiproliferative potential
associated with the leaves of C. prophetarum and silver nanoformulations. This study highlights the potential
use of the cucurbitaceae family species in combination
with nanotechnology for various biomedical applications.

Results and Discussion
This study investigated the biosynthesis of C. prophetarum silver nanoparticles (Cp-AgNPs) and evaluation of the antibacterial
and antiproliferative potential of nanoparticles using the aqueous
leaf extract of C. prophetarum.

Phytochemical
Analysis
Various phytochemical constituents
in the aqueous leaf extract of C. prophetarum responsible for the reduction and capping of silver nanoparticles
are qualitatively analyzed. From the phytochemical screening of the C. prophetarum aqueous leaf extract, it was found
to be a good source of secondary metabolites, as shown in Table 1. Phytochemical analysis
of aqueous leaf extracts of Cucumis sativus(14) and Cucumis Melo(15) has been reported with similar phytoconstituents.
These phytochemicals may be responsible for the reduction of silver
and acting as a capping agent to prevent aggregation of and provide
stability to the nanoparticles.16 The majority
of the phytochemicals extracted in polar solvents are polar in nature
and play a significant role in the synthesis of nanoparticles.17

Characterization of Cp-AgNPs
As the aqueous leaf extract
of C. prophetarum was added to silver
nitrate solution, the color of the solution changed from pale yellow
to reddish-brown after 3 h because of the process of reduction of
Ag+ to Ag° nanoparticles (Figure 1A), and this indicated the biosynthesis of
Cp-AgNPs. UV–vis spectra of the Cp-AgNPs and the aqueous leaf
extract give a sharp peak at 420 nm after 3 h incubation (Figure 1B). UV–visible
spectroscopy is one of the most widely used techniques for structural
characterization of nanoparticles. The presence of an absorbance peak
at about 420 nm clearly indicates the formation of AgNPs in the solution
due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) electrons present on the nanoparticle
surface.18 The SPR pattern is dependent
on the characteristics of the individual metal particles, such as
size and shape, as well as the dielectric properties of the medium
used for synthesis and the inter-nanoparticle coupling interactions.
The intensity of the SPR band increased with reaction time, indicating
the synthesis of the AgNPs.

change of the extract
from pale yellow to dark brown after incubation at room temperature
(RT); (B) UV spectra of the aqueous leaf extract and Cp-AgNPs synthesized
from the C. prophetarum leaf extract.

The hydrodynamic particle size distribution, polydispersity
index
(PDI), and surface charge (ζ-potential) of the biosynthesized
Cp-AgNPs were measured using the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique.
The nanoparticle samples were appropriately diluted to reduce the
background scattering. The size distribution graph shows the average
size of the synthesized Cp-AgNPs to be approximately 90 nm with a
low polydispersity index of 0.3 (Figure 2A), and the ζ-potential was observed
to be −36.7 mV (Figure 2B). The hydrodynamic size includes the hydration layer on
the surface of AgNPs; thus, this size is generally larger than the
size measured from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Additionally,
the phytochemicals in the leaf extract may contribute to the hydrodynamic
size. A nanoparticle size value below 150 nm and PDI values around
0.3 are adequate for uptake by cells.19 Different phytochemicals present in extracts are mainly responsible
for the various particle sizes. A similar range of particle sizes
was observed with silver nanoparticles synthesized using red apple
fruit extract.20 The higher the negative
or positive ζ-potential, the higher the stability, the better
the colloidal properties due to electrostatic repulsion, and the higher
the dispersity.21 The ζ-potential
of Cp-AgNPs was negative, suggesting that negatively charged functional
groups from the plant extract contribute to the colloidal stability
of the AgNPs.6

(A) size and PDI analysis; (B)
ζ-potential of the biosynthesized Cp-AgNPs.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to identify
the secondary metabolites involved in the reduction and capping of
Cp-AgNPs. The FTIR spectrum of the C. prophaterum leaf extract showed major absorption peaks at 3327.42, 2927.3, 1565.55,
1355.18, 1043.27, 832.05, 602.14, and 539.4 cm–1 (Figure 3A, red).
The FTIR spectrum of Cp-AgNPs showed major absorption peaks at 3309.15,
2927, 1602, 1075, and 538 cm–1, which signify the
presence of phytoconstituents that act as capping agents (Figure 3A, blue).

Figure 3 FTIR spectra
of the C. prophetarum leaf extract
(red) and Cp-AgNPs (blue) synthesized from the leaf
extract.

The FTIR spectra of the C. prophaterum leaf extract corresponding to Cp-AgNPs
showed major and minor shifts
of the peaks reasonably due to the reduction, capping, and stabilization
of the synthesized nanoparticles.22 A shift
is observed for the peak at 3327.42 cm–1 to a lower
wavelength of 3309.15 cm–1 due to the involvement
of the O–H or N–H stretching of phenolic compounds that
are present in the leaf extract;23 the
absorption peak at 2927.3 cm–1 is due to the C–H
stretching of the methylene group or aliphatic group, and it is also
a characteristic peak of triterpenoid saponins;24 the band at 1565.55 cm–1 shifted to a
higher wavelength 1602 cm–1 showing the involvement
of alkenyl or aromatic C=C stretch; the band at 1355.18 cm–1 showed the presence of the −C–O stretching
of phenol or tertiary alcohols; the band at 1043.27 cm–1 showed the O–H stretching of the phenol group;25 the band at 832.05 cm–1 was
because of the C–O stretch and C–S stretch or the involvement
of aliphatic chloro compounds;26 the band
at 602.14 cm–1 might be due to the C–H stretching
of the aromatic group; and the peak at 539.4 cm–1 showed the OH group of phenols. The majority of the peaks correspond
to the phenolic groups of the polyphenols, triterpenoids, alkaloids,
steroids, and tannins, adequately present in the leaf extract, which
help in the formation of Cp-AgNPs.27 These
findings are inconsistent with the phytochemical analysis performed
on the leaves of C. prophaterum.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the biosynthesized Cp-AgNPs
shows five diffraction peaks at 2θ = 32.18, 38.04, 46.13, 54.63,
and 77.08° (Figure 4). These major peaks in the spectrum, corresponding to the (111),
(200), (120), (202), and (311) planes, respectively, reflect the patterns
of the face-centered cubic (fcc) and crystalline structure of the
biosynthesized AgNPs. The peaks of the (111), (200), and (311) planes
were also observed in the biosynthesized AgNPs using Convolvulus arvensis extract.28 In addition, the peak of (120) was coincident with that
of the AgNPs synthesized from Excoecaria agallocha.29 The size of the nanoparticles will
significantly influence the XRD peak patterns.30 The presence of various reducing agents in the extract
is responsible for the stabilization of AgNPs and, thus, for providing
the crystalline structure of AgNPs, which was well studied in various
biosynthesized nanoparticles.31

Figure 4 XRD pattern
of the synthesized Cp-AgNPs using C.
prophetarum leaf extract.

The morphology of the green-synthesized Cp-AgNPs was examined using
SEM. The prepared Cp-AgNPs were found to be in polymorphic shapes;
some of them were irregularly granulated, ellipsoidal, and highly
aggregated, as shown in Figure 5A. Similar results were observed in the biosynthesis of silver
nanoparticles using Taraxacum officinale.(32) The size of Cp-AgNPs from SEM analysis
was found to be in the range of 30–50 nm (Figure 5A). Elemental analysis by EDX
results showed a strong absorption peak of silver at 3 keV, which
is due to silver being the major constituent33 (Figure 5B). Microscopic
analysis using a scanning electron microscope showed that the Cp-AgNPs
were uniformly distributed and also showed that the formed nanoparticles
were spherical in shape. Moreover, the high agglomeration of the biosynthesized
AgNPs was possibly induced by dehydration exerted during the preparation
of samples for SEM analysis.34 In the EDX
spectrum, the strong peak at 3 keV was due to the presence of the
silver element. Carbon and oxygen were also detected in the spectrum,
which were associated with the organic compounds of the leaf extract
on the surface of Cp-AgNPs and play an important role in the reduction
and stability of biosynthesized Cp-AgNPs.35

Antioxidant Activity Using
DPPH and ABTS Assay
The
in vitro antioxidant activity of the aqueous leaf extract of C. prophetarum and Cp-AgNPs was determined using
DPPH and ABTS assays. From the analysis, we can conclude that the
scavenging effect of the aqueous leaf extract and Cp-AgNPs on DPPH
(Figure 6A) and ABTS
radicals (Figure 6B)
was increased in a dose-dependent manner; ascorbic acid was used as
a standard. It was found that the Cp-AgNPs have higher free radical
inhibition percentage with IC50 values of 29.2 and 34.5
μg/mL as compared to the aqueous leaf extract with IC50 values of 46.6 and 50 μg/mL using DPPH and ABTS, respectively.

Figure 6 Free radical
scavenging activity of different concentrations of
the aqueous leaf extract of C. prophetarum and Cp-AgNPs using (A) DPPH scavenging effect and (B) ABTS assay.

The neutral and cationic radical quenching ability
of the nanoparticles
was assayed, which showed the capability of the Cp-AgNPs with stable
neutral radicals obtained from DPPH and free cationic radicals from
ABTS. Both applied tests presented different aspects of the antioxidative
mechanism. While the DPPH assay shows the capacity of silver nanoparticles
to transfer electrons to neutralize the free radicals of unstable
DPPH in the reaction medium,36 the ABTS
assay determines the cationic free radical scavenging activity involving
both electron and hydrogen transfer mechanisms.37

Antibacterial Activity Using Disc Diffusion
Assay
The
antibacterial activity of the aqueous leaf extract of C. prophetarum and biosynthesized Cp-AgNPs was checked
by the disc diffusion method against S. aureus (Gram-positive) and S. typhi (Gram-negative)
bacteria, as shown in Figure 7. Cp-AgNPs showed high antibacterial activity in terms of
zone of inhibition against S. aureus and S. typhi (Figure 7B,D) when compared to the aqueous leaf extract
of C. prophetarum (Figure 7 A,C). The maximum zone of
inhibition at the highest concentration of Cp-AgNPs was 18 and 20
mm against S. aureus (Figure 7B) and S. typhi, respectively (Figure 7D). Cp-AgNPs showed higher antibacterial
activity against S. typhi as compared
to S. aureus in a dose-dependent manner,
as shown in Table 2.

extract and (B) Cp-AgNPs against S. aureus and (C) aqueous extract and (D) Cp-AgNPs against S. typhi.

The zone of inhibition on all bacterial strains was measured after
24 h of incubation at 37 °C. The aqueous leaf extract showed
significant antibacterial activity and was found to be lower when
applied alone as compared with Cp-AgNPs (Table 2). Comparative antibacterial activities using
the leaf extract of Artemisia vulgaris also resulted in similar findings.36 The
diameter of the inhibition zone is larger for S. typhi as compared to S. aureus. The antibacterial
activity of AgNPs is more pronounced in the case of the Gram-negative
bacteria as reported.18 This minor difference
can be due to the difference in the composition of their cell wall,
as the cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria consists of a single
layer of peptidoglycan, while multiple layers of peptidoglycan are
present in the membrane of Gram-positive bacteria, which makes them
more rigid.38 The silver ions from nanoparticles
are attracted by the negative charge of the bacterial cell wall, and
when they experience some electrostatic attraction toward the bacterial
cell wall, they will move and get attached to the cell wall and lead
to a change in the composition of the cell wall by affecting its permeability.39 The DNA of microorganisms loses its replication
ability and also the expression of ribosome subunit proteins as well
as other cellular proteins, and most of the enzymes essential for
ATP production become inactivated upon treatment with Ag+ ions.40

Assessment of Antiproliferative
Activity on Cancer Cell Lines
To check the antiproliferative
activity of the green-synthesized
Cp-AgNPs, different concentrations of nanoparticles were added to
cancer cell lines, such as A549, MDA-MB-231, HepG2, and MCF-7, and
they were incubated for 24 h. The MTT assay result shows that there
is a gradual decrease in cell viability with increasing concentration
of Cp-AgNPs (Figure 8). The IC50 value of Cp-AgNPs for A549, MDA-MB-231, HepG2,
and MCF-7 was calculated to be 105.8, 81.1, 94.2, and 65.6 μg/mL,
respectively. At the IC50 concentration of Cp-AgNPs, the
morphology of the cells was observed under an inverted microscope
(Figure 9).

concentrations of Cp-AgNPs on the viability

comparisons; ****P-value signifies < 0.0001, ***P-value signifies < 0.001, **P-value

Figure 9 Morphology at the IC50 concentration
of Cp-AgNPs of
cancer cell lines (A) A549, (B) MDA-MB-231, (C) HepG2, and (D) MCF-7.

Depending on the results of the antiproliferative
activity analysis,
we may conclude that the biosynthesized AgNPs are more toxic toward
MCF-7 as compared to the MDA-MB-231, HepG2, and A549 cells, as shown
in Figure 8. Silver
nanoparticles synthesized using the leaf extract of A. vulgaris also showed an IC50 value
close to 60 μg/mL for MCF-7 cells.36 Our results are also in agreement with the effectiveness of the
aqueous leaf extract of C. sativus against
MCF-7 cells.41 Methanolic leaf extract
of T. officinale also exhibited enhanced
activity against MCF-7 cell lines.32 The
present work is the first comparative study that investigates the
cell viability of C. prophetarum leaf
extract-mediated biosynthesized AgNPs against different cancer cell
lines. Due to the enhanced cellular uptake and retention of NPs, the
Cp-AgNPs showed a difference in cytotoxicity toward different cell
lines. This is because the NPs can enter the cells via endocytosis
due to their small size and are not subjected to efflux by P-glycoprotein.42

Conclusions
The synthesis of AgNPs using C. prophetarum through a green chemistry approach with several advantages such
as an economic, efficient, and ecofriendly process, which is also
energy-efficient and cost-effective, results in healthier workplaces
and communities, protecting human health and the environment, leading
to less waste and safer products. The potentially active phytoconstituents
involved in the plant-mediated synthesis of nanoparticles are biocompatible
for a wide range of biomedical applications. Additionally, the nanoparticles
were studied to show their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria and antiproliferative effects on different
human cancer cell lines, which were A549, MDA-MB-231, HepG2, and MCF-7,
in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, this report adds another feature
to the medicinal hub plant C. prophetarum, i.e., its ability to successfully formulate AgNPs, which could
be used effectively for their antibacterial and antiproliferative
properties.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Silver nitrate (AgNO3), Muller
Hilton Agar, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid) (ABTS), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were procured from HiMedia.
All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and high purity
and were procured from reputed firms.

Collection of Plant Material
and Preparation of Extract
Leaves of C. prophetarum were collected
from the Central University of Rajasthan, Kishangarh, Ajmer. The specimen
sample was taxonomically identified and authenticated by the Department
of Botany, Rajasthan University, where a voucher specimen was deposited
(authentication no. RUBL No. 211677). The leaves were washed thoroughly
with distilled water and allowed to dry in the shade at room temperature.
The dried leaves were crushed using an electric lab blender to make
fine powder. For 25 g of leaf powder, 250 mL of distilled water was
added, and the mixture was heated at 80 °C for 3 h with continuous
stirring, and the resultant extract was then filtered through Whatman
filter paper no. 1. The extract was stored at 4 °C until further
use.

Preliminary Phytochemical Analysis
Preliminary phytochemical
analysis was performed to determine various phytoconstituents present
in the freshly prepared leaf extracts of C. prophetarum, such as phenol, triterpenoids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, and
alkaloids using standard phytochemical procedures followed by Cyril
et al.43

Green Synthesis of Silver
Nanoparticles
For the green
synthesis of silver nanoparticles, we used the aqueous leaf extract
of C. prophetarum prepared in the previous
step. For this, 10 mL of leaf extract was added to 90 mL of 1 mM aqueous
silver nitrate solution, followed by heating at 80 °C for 3 h
with constant stirring. The formation of the AgNPs was preliminarily
detected by the change in color from yellow to dark brown. The green-synthesized
nanoparticles were separated using centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. This process was repeated thrice to get rid
of free silver associated with Cp-AgNPs. The final green-synthesized
silver nanoparticles were denoted as Cp-AgNPs, which were freeze-dried
and then stored at 4 °C until further use.

Characterization
of Silver Nanoparticles
UV–vis Spectroscopic Measurements
UV–vis
spectra were recorded to check the reduction of silver nitrate with C. prophetarum leaf extract using an HMG Labtech
SPECTROstar Nano in the range of 220–700 and 1 nm resolution.

Particle Size, PDI, and ζ-Potential Measurements
The
average hydrodynamic particle size distribution, PDI, and ζ-potential
of the nanoparticles were measured using a Zetasizer nanoZS (Malvern
Instruments, Malvern, U.K.) by the dynamic light scattering (DLS)
technique. The size measurements were carried out at 25 °C, adjusting
the light scattering angle at 90°. The surface charge (ζ-potential)
of the Cp-AgNPs was measured using an electrophoretic cell under an
electric field. The sample was prepared by diluting the nanoparticles
with MilliQ water and ultrasonicating for 5 min to obtain a well-dispersed
suspension.

Functional Group Analysis by FTIR Measurements
The
functional groups present in the phytoconstituents responsible for
the reduction and capping of Cp-AgNPs were analyzed with an FTIR spectrophotometer
(PerkinElmer Spectrum Version 10.4.00, M/s PerkinElmer Co., Waltham,
Massachusetts) using the KBr pellet method. The scanning range of
the FTIR spectrophotometer was 4000–400 cm–1with a spectral resolution of 1 cm–1.

XRD Analysis
XRD was used to investigate the phase
and crystalline structure of the biosynthesized Cp-AgNPs. The analysis
was done on an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical-Empyrean) using Cu
Kα radiation with a wavelength of 1.540 A° at 40 kV and
30 mA, and a scanning rate of 0.02 cm–1 in the region
of 2θ ranging between 30 and 90°.

FESEM and Energy-Dispersive
X-ray Analysis (EDAX) of Cp-AgNPs
FESEM integrated with EDX
was used to examine the surface morphology,
size, and atomic content of metals in biosynthesized Cp-AgNPs. The
surface morphology of the Cp-AgNPs was measured using a scanning electron
microscope (EVO 18, ZEISS) at a magnification of 10 000×.
The samples were fixed on the tubular aluminum stub with double-sided
tape. The stub-supported samples were coated with gold. Finally, the
gold-coated samples were placed under the microscope to observe the
morphology.

Antioxidant Activity
DPPH Free Radical Scavenging
Assay
The antioxidant
activity of the aqueous leaf extract was evaluated using the DPPH
radical scavenging method.44 Briefly, 100
μL of various concentrations of Cp-AgNPs, plant extract, and
standard (ascorbic acid) (10, 20, 50, 75, 100, and 150 μg/mL)
were mixed with 100 μL of DPPH (0.1 mM in 80% ethanol) and incubated
in the dark for 30 min at room temperature (RT). The absorbance of
the reaction mixtures was measured using a BMG Labtech spectrophotometer
at 517 nm against a blank (80% ethanol). DPPH free radical scavenging
activity percentage was calculated using the formula given below  

The IC50 values of the extract
and nanoparticles were calculated from the graph using the equation Y = mX and the linear regression coefficient.

ABTS Free Radical Scavenging Assay
The ABTS radical
scavenging activity of different concentrations of the aqueous leaf
extract and Cp-AgNPs was estimated by a standard protocol.45 The stock solution of ABTS was prepared by mixing
ABTS (7 mM) with potassium persulfate (2.45 mM), and then the mixture
was incubated at RT in the dark for 16 h. After that, the working
solution was obtained by diluting the stock solution with methanol
to obtain an absorbance of around 0.85 ± 0.20 at 734 nm. Then,
20 μL of various concentrations (10, 20, 50, 75, 100 and 150
μg/mL) of the aqueous leaf extract and Cp-AgNPs were added to
180 μL of ABTS working solution. The mixture was left for 30
min at room temperature and the absorbance was measured using a BMG
Labtech spectrophotometer at 734 nm. Ascorbic acid was taken as a
standard. ABTS free radical scavenging percentage activity was calculated
using the following formula  

Antibacterial Activity Using the Disc Diffusion Method
The antibacterial activity of the aqueous leaf extract of C. prophetarum and biosynthesized Cp-AgNPs was determined
using the disc diffusion method.46 A bacterial
inoculum suspension was spread uniformly on solidified Muller–Hinton
Agar (MHA) using a sterile swab. The bacterial strains used in this
study were Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC96) and Gram-negative S. typhi (ATCC13076). A fixed volume of about 25 μL having different
concentrations of the aqueous leaf extract (50, 75, 100, and 150 μg/mL)
and green-synthesized Cp-AgNPs (20, 50, and 75 μg/mL) was added
into different discs and placed in Petri plates for incubation at
37 °C for 24 h. The obtained zones of inhibition were measured
in millimeters. A disc loaded with 10 μg of gentamycin was used
as the positive control and DMSO was used as the negative control.

Culturing of Cell Lines
Different types of cancer cell
lines, such as a lung cancer cell line (A549), breast cancer cell
lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), and a hepatic cancer cell line (HepG2),
were used for assessment of the proliferative effect of green-synthesized
Cp-AgNPs. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
was used to subculture the cell lines in a CO2 incubator
with 5% CO2. Cells were counted, and the cell viability
was checked by trypan blue using a hemocytometer. The cells were seeded
at 1 × 104 in a 96-well plate for performing MTT assay
for 24 h at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator.

Assessment
of Antiproliferative Activity on Cancer Cell Lines
A549,
MDA-MB-231, HepG2, and MCF-7 cell lines were treated with
different concentrations (10, 20, 50, 75, 100, and 150 μg/mL)
of biosynthesized Cp-AgNPs. The dilutions were prepared in DMSO. After
treatment, the cells were incubated for 24 h in the CO2 incubator. After 24 h, the morphology of the cells was observed
under a microscope, and then, 20 μL of the MTT reagent (5 mg/mL)
was added and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the
formazan produced was solubilized by the addition of 100 μL
of DMSO. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a 96-well plate
reader, and the cell viability was calculated as follows  

Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed in a grouped
analysis by ANOVA using GraphPad Prism software. P-value < 0.05 was considered as a significant level between treated
and control sets. The results were denoted as mean ± standard
deviation of three experiments.
