In
this paper, one imidazole macrocyclic divalent cation with a

of its conformation. Six novel organic–inorganic hybrid supramolecules
{([syn/anti-did](CdI4)(C2H3N)} (1), {([syn/anti-did](HgI4)(C2H3N)} (2), {([syn/syn-did](Pb2I8)(PbI5)} (3), {([syn/syn-did](Bi2I8)(BiI5)} (4), {([syn/syn-did](Ag4Br6)}n (5), and {([syn/anti-did](Ag2I4)} (6) [did2+ = (12z, 52z)-11H, 51H-1, 5(1, 3)-diimidazol-3-iuma-3, 7(1, 2)-dibenzenacyclooctaphane-13, 53-diium] have been synthesized through the self-assembly

reaction. These compounds have been unambiguously confirmed by powder
X-ray diffraction, IR, thermogravimetric and X-ray single-crystal
diffraction. Crystallographic analysis shows that the anions of compounds 1 and 2 are isostructural with mononuclear anion

cyclophanes of organic cations may exist in a syn/syn-conformation
in 3–5 or syn/anti conformation in 1, 2, 6, but tilting angles in compounds 1–6 were different. This article described
the photocatalytic degradation of organic dye in waste water and the
optical band gap of compounds 1–6. The calculated semiconductor band gap of compounds 1–6 is smaller than that of TiO2, so
compounds 1–6 have semiconductor
properties. Compound 1 has the smallest band gap value,
and the photocatalytic performance is the best.

Introduction
Cyclophane is an important
macrocyclic compound and has been receiving
much attention for many years.1 Supramolecular
formation often relies on macrocyclic compounds, such as cyclophanes,
which are composed of aromatic and aliphatic carbons, to achieve host–guest
chemistry.2 The imidazole and benzimidazole
cyclophanes have great significance, and there have been a lot of
studies about their synthesis, conformational behavior, anion recognition,3 and as precursors to N-heterocyclic carbene metal
complexes.4 These types of cyclophanes
can exhibit a fluxional behavior in solution involving the interconversion
of different conformers. On one hand, molecular fluxionality brings
conformational adjustability and better adaptability. On the other
hand, it also brings difficulties to research. For instance, Baker
group have done many excellent works by variable-temperature NMR,
to investigate the conformational behavior of the imidazole cyclophane
in the solid state and in solution.5−16 It is proved that the syn/trans conformation (imidazole rings mutually
syn, benzene rings mutually anti) of the imidazole cyclophane is dominant
and more stable. However, because of the conformational lability of
most cyclophanes and hard crystallization, many investigations can
only be performed in solution at room temperature via the analysis
of NMR spectroscopy and only at lower temperatures, the exchange processes
could be slowed sufficiently to enable particular conformations as
“frozen out”.15 Therefore,
conformation immobilization has become an important research topic.
It is reported that there are two specific methods for achieving immobilization
of fluid molecules: one is the use of covalent bonds such as calixarene
immobilization;17−20 the other would be the use of coordination bonds to realize carbine
immobilization.16 However, the use of electrovalent
bonds for the conformational immobilization of variable organics is
rarely reported. The advantage of this method is that the original
composition of organics remains untouched during the immobilization
and more conformation information and details can be found and studied.

In recent years, many organic–inorganic supramolecular assembling
bodies obtained through electrostatic driving have been synthesized
and achieved good results in photocatalytic degradation of organic
dyes.21−23 Under light conditions, organic pollutants were oxidized
by the supramolecular semiconductor catalysts to CO2, H2O, and other nontoxic inorganic small molecules to achieve
photodegradation.23 Many studies on the
crystallization of supramolecular hybrids formed by electrovalent
interactions between inorganic metal cluster anions and multivalent
organic cations have been reported in our laboratory.24−26 This provides a shortcut to study the conformational immobilization
of cyclophane and the structure–property relationship of them.

In this paper, the ortho-biimidazolium ring5−16,27−29 (did2+, Scheme 1) was selected
for the first time as a target model for conformational solidification
and six kinds of imidazolium-based macrocyclic supramolecular compounds
were synthesized by self-assembly. In compounds 1–6 containing the identified conformations of did2+, the imidazole units were mutually syn. There was a flip of the
benzene rings, which showed anti or syn conformers. Rotation of the
imidazolium rings about their N–N axis interconverted the two
different syn/syn conformers. Interestingly, exo-syn/syn and endo-syn/syn
conformation (the imidazole rings C2 are exo or endo with respect
to the cyclophanes skelet, imidazole rings are mutually syn, benzene
rings are mutually syn) coexisted in compounds 3–4 by a supramolecular recognition assembly in solution. Photocatalytic
properties and optical band gap of compounds 1–6 were also investigated.

Results and Discussion
Description
of Crystal Structures
Crystal Structure of Compounds {[did](CdI4)(C2H3N)} (1) and {[did](HgI4)(C2H3N)} (2)
X-ray single-crystal
diffraction shows that both compounds 1 (Figure 1a,b) and 2 (Figure 1c,d) crystallize
in a monoclinic system with space group P21/c. They are isostructural
and isomorphous, so we take compound 1 as an example
to illustrate the molecular structures. As shown in Figure 1a, the basic asymmetric structural
unit of compound 1 consists of (did)2+ imidazole
ring and (CdI4)2– anion. In (CdI4)2– anion, the central Cd atom coordinates
with four I atoms to form an irregular tetrahedral structure. The
Cd–I bond lengths are Cd1–I1 = 2.7492, Cd1–I2
= 2.7657, Cd1–I3 = 2.7639, and Cd1–I4 = 2.7777 Å,
and the I–Cd1–I bond angles range from 101.67(3) to
118.62(3)°. As shown in Figure 1b, there is hydrogen bonding between I atom and imidazole
ring (C–H···I = 3.023–3.062 Å).
Hydrogen bonds, van der Waals force, and electrostatic interactions
form a two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular structure. The cyclophane
of 1 existed in a single conformer, which is assigned
as a flattened syn/anti conformation (mutually syn imidazole rings,
mutually anti benzene rings).5−16,27−29

and anions in 2. Unnecessary H atoms were omitted for

Crystals Structure of {[did](Pb2I8)(PbI5)} (3) and {[did](Bi2I8)(BiI5)} (4)
Compounds 3 (Figure 2a,b) and 4 (Figure 2c,d) are supramolecular compounds with very
similar structures. Both
structures are monoclinic with space group P21/c. Let us take compound 4 as an example. As shown in Figure 2c, the asymmetric structure unit of compound 4 is composed of two (did)2+ cations, one (BiI2I8)2–, and one (BiI5)2– anion. (BiI2I8)2– contains two centrally symmetric (BiI4)− linked together by two bridged I atoms. In (BiI4)2– anion, the central Bi atom coordinates with four
I atoms to form a distorted octahedron configuration. Coordination
mode: Bi1 has coordinates with two t–I, two μ2-I, and two μ3-I. Bond lengths of Bi1–I are
between 2.8726(7) and 3.3713(7) Å. Bi2 has coordinates with three
t–I, two μ2-I and one μ3-I.
Bond lengths of Bi2–I are between 2.9345(8) and 3.3075(6) Å.
In the anion cluster (BiI5)−, Bi3 is
a pentacoordinate mode, which coordinates with three t–I and
two μ2-I. Bond lengths of Bi3–I are between
2.9593(8) and 3.215(7) Å. As shown in Figure 2d, four cations surround tetranuclear anion
octahedrons, which are arranged in a back-to-back organic cation gap.
Interestingly, there exist two different syn/syn conformations of
cyclophanes (mutually syn imidazole rings, mutually syn benzene rings)
in compounds 3–4: One is that the
imidazole rings C2 are exo with respect to the cyclophane skeleton
(rocking chair). The other is that the imidazole rings C2 are endo
with respect to the cyclophane skeleton (cradle type) (mutually syn
imidazole rings, mutually syn benzene rings).5−16,27−29 Accordingly,
the anion parts exhibit two different structural units. Organic cations
and anions are interlaced in layers that form a 2D supramolecular
structure by electrostatic interaction and van der Waals interaction.

structural unit of compound 3; (b)

anion is surrounded by an organic cation to form a sandwich structure.

omitted for clarity.

Crystal Structure of {[did](Ag4Br6)}n (5)
As shown in Figure 3a, it can be seen
from X-ray single-crystal diffraction that compound 5 belongs to the triclinic system. In 5, there is a single
exo-syn/syn conformation of organic cation, which is attributed to
a syn/syn conformation in which imidazole rings C2 are exo with respect
to cyclophane skeleton (rocking chair) (mutually syn imidazole rings,
mutually syn benzene rings).5−16,27−29 The space group
is P21/c, and the
asymmetric unit contain a cis-form of the imidazolium divalent organic
cation (did)2+ and an anion cluster (Ag4Br6)2–. The divalent anion (Ag4Br6)2– is composed of four silver atoms and
six bromine atoms. Ag1 is in a tetracoordinated mode, coordinating
with a t–Br, a μ2-Br, and a μ3-Br to form a tetrahedral configuration. Ag1–Br bond lengths
range from 2.562 to 3.052 Å. Ag2 is in a tetracoordinate mode,
coordinating with a t–Br, a μ2-Br, and two
μ3-Br. The range of Ag2–Br bond lengths is
2.687–2.797 Å. Ag3 is linked to a μ2-Br
and three μ3-Br. The 4-connecting mode of Ag3 atom
leads to a distorted tetrahedral configuration. Bond lengths are Ag3–Br4
= 2.720, Ag3–Br3 = 2.664, Ag3–Br6 = 2.657, and Ag3–Br5
= 2.809 Å. Ag4 is in a tetracoordinate mode, coordinating with
two μ2-Br and two μ3-Br to form
a distortion tetrahedron. The bond lengths are Ag4–Br3 = 2.631,
Ag4–Br6 = 2.572, Ag4–Br5 = 2.712, and Ag4–Br51 = 3.010 Å. As shown in Figure 3b, the Ag atoms are connected by bridged
Br atoms to form a one-dimensional chain. As shown in Figure 3c, the one-dimensional chain
of one (Ag4Br6)2– anion cluster
is surrounded by four imidazole ring cations and the four imidazole
ring cations are symmetrically distributed with respect to the anions.
As shown in Figure 3d, an anion chain and an organic cation are infinitely extended by
a hydrogen bond between C–H···Br to form a three-dimensional
(3D) supramolecular structure.

anionic one-dimensional chain structure of compound 5; (c) stacking diagram of compound 5; and (d) 3D stacking
diagram of compound 5. Unnecessary H atoms were omitted
for clarity.

Crystal Structure of {[did](Ag2I4)} (6)
It was found by
X-ray single-crystal diffraction
that the compound 6 belongs to the monoclinic system, P21/c space group, and the inorganic anion is a binuclear structure. As
shown in Figure 4a,
the asymmetric unit contains (did)2+ and (Ag2I4)2–. (Ag2I4)2– consist of two Ag atoms and four I atoms, of which
Ag1 and Ag2 are in tricoordinate modes: they are coordinated with
one t–I and two μ2-I, respectively, to form
a planar triangular configuration. The Ag1–I bond length range
is 2.6630(13)–3.0530(8) Å, where Ag1–Ag2 = 2.9527(15)
Å is less than twice the van der Waals radius of 3.44 Å,
indicating the presence of Ag–Ag. A study of 6 indicates that this cyclophane exists in a single syn/anti conformation
and was assigned as a flattened anti conformation in which the benzene
rings may simply lie closer to the “plane” of the cyclophanes
(mutually syn imidazole rings, mutually anti benzene rings) (Table S3).5−16,27−29 The imidazolium
divalent cation is trans configuration, and the two benzene rings
are separated on both sides of the imidazole ring. Organic cation
and anion are stacked together by electrostatic interaction and van
der Waals force to form a 2D supramolecular structure, as shown in Figure 4b.

unit of compound 6; (b)
stacking diagram of compound 6. Unnecessary H atoms were

Cyclophane Conformation Immobilization
Although the
small calixarene conformation can be immobilized by covalent bond
synthesis,17−20 it was difficult to immobilize the calixarene with a larger inner
cavity. It is not itself anymore after modification with alkane groups
(Scheme 2a) because
very small atomic steric changes can lead to different results let
alone with big alkane groups.30 In the
carbene complex,5−16,28,29 the cyclophane conformations were single exo-syn/syn with lack of
diversity due to the formation of coordination bonds and steric hindrance
(Scheme 2b).16 In this article, varying conformations of cyclophane
were “freezed” and immobilized by solvothermal synthesis
and supramolecular assembly near room temperature. There exists endo-syn/syn
or exo-syn/syn conformation in compounds 3–5 and syn/anti conformation in 1, 2, and 6. Diversified conformations in the compounds
induced anions to form different structures. Dihedral angles between
imidazole rings and dihedral angles between benzene rings were measured
(Table S3).5−16,27−29 Tilting angles
of compounds 1–6 were different (Scheme 3). The cyclophane
cation configuration is also different. Organic cation adapted to
different anions by rotation of the imidazole ring and ring flip of
the benzene rings. In compounds 1–6, these nearly untouched cations with different conformations also
offer opportunities for the research of a structure–property
relationship.

Scheme 3 Comparison of Some Important Conformational
Parameters of did2+ in Compounds 1–6
Powder X-ray Diffraction
(PXRD) and Thermogravimetric Analyses
(TGA)
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been used to confirm
the purity of the samples in the solid state and the stability of
compounds in water. For compounds 1–6, the as-synthesized PXRD patterns closely match the simulated patterns
generated from the results of the single-crystal diffraction data,
indicative of pure products in solid state, which are shown in Figure S1. From the PXRD data (Figure S1), we found that compounds 1–6 remained stable after being immersed in water for 24 h.

To investigate thermostability of compounds 1–6, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) experiments were performed
up to 800 °C in a flowing N2 atmosphere, as shown
in Figure 5. All complexes
are stable up to the temperature of around 300 °C (for 1 and 2: 302 °C, 3: 298 °C, 4: 278 °C, 5: 305 °C, and 6: 320 °C), indicating that they are a heat-resistant hybrid.31 The TG curves of compounds 1 and 2 are similar, which mainly undergo two stages of weightlessness.
Compound 1 undergoes a rapid and sustained weight loss
process after 302 °C mainly due to the thermal decomposition
of organic cations and the collapse of some organic skeletons. Compound 3 exhibits a rapid weight loss process in the range of 298–415
°C, mainly due to the thermal decomposition of organic cations,
with experimental value 23.45% (theoretical value 23.17%). The inorganic
anion pyrolysis process in the second step from 415 to 654 °C
and the subsequent weight loss process in the range of 654–800
°C are assigned to the decomposition of the inorganic skeleton.
The weight loss process of compound 4 is from 278 to
800 °C, which is attributed to the loss of organic cations and
the collapse of anionic structures. Compounds 5 and 6 have a common metal center, and their weight loss curves
are consistent. Compounds 5 and 6 have a
common metal center, and their weight loss curves are uniform. As
shown in Figure 5,
therefore, the stability of compounds 1–6 is relatively good.

Theoretical Calculation
We adopt Gauss View 6.0 program
and B3LYP method32−36 to investigate the electronic structure of the title compounds.
A Lanl2dz basis set was used for Cd, Hg, Pb, Bi, Ag, I, and Br atoms.
A 6-31G(d,q) basis set was applied in C, H, N, and O atoms. The energy
of title compounds is −1296.58 (1), −1291.24
(2), −2457.83 (3), −2469.69
(4), −3030.98 (5), and −1744.69
(6) au after one cycle of calculation. The dipole moment
of title compounds is 55.171857 (1), 49.619014 (2), 100.219505 (3), 100.481870 (4), 41.945372 (5), and 62.148060 (6) Debye,
indicating a non-centrosymmetric structure.

Calculations based
on density functional theory were carried out to obtain information
about the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) distributions of compounds 1–6 (Figure S3). The
molecular orbital amplitude of compounds 1–2 revealed that the HOMO was generally distributed in the
anion whereas the LUMO was distributed mostly in the imidazole ring
of the organic cation. For compounds 1–2, HOMO energies of the crystal orbit are −3.84 and −3.44
eV and LUMO energies are −3.55 and −2.93 eV. The molecular
orbital amplitudes of compounds 3–6 revealed that HOMO and LOMO are generally distributed in the anions.
HOMO energies of the crystal orbit for compounds 3–6 are −5.31, −5.64, −5.36, and −4.97
eV, and LUMO energies are −5.07, −5.36, −4.92,
and −4.38 eV. The energy band gaps calculated from the HOMO
and LUMO energy values (ΔE = ELOMO – EHOMO) for compounds 1–6 are 0.29, 0.51, 0.24, 0.28, 0.44,
and 0.59 eV. The occupied orbital energies of compounds 1–6 are all negative, indicating that the electronic
state is relatively stable. Compounds of the same main group metal
or adjacent main group metal are similar in structure. It can be seen
from the TG that the stability of the compound 1 is less
than that of 2, the stability of the compound 3 is less than that of 4, and the stability of the compound 5 is less than that of 6. So for structurally
similar compounds, the greater the energy level difference, the harder
it is for electrons to transition and the more stable is the molecule.

Morphological Study
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
is deemed to be the most effective method testing the tiny size of
the micro/nanomaterial.37−40 Scanning electron microcopy micrographs show the
resultant supramolecular formation for the six different experiments.
The SEM is based on secondary electrons and backscattered electron
imaging generated by the interaction between electrons and the sample. Figure 6 shows the SEM images
of the morphologies of the compounds 1–6 exhibiting a kind of block-shaped crystal owing to SEM’s
working mode, which generates charge accumulation in incident electron
bombardment and electron beam instability, resulting in high-light
areas on the surface of the sample. Among them compounds 1–2 appear as porous crystalline materials.

of compounds 1 (a), 2 (b), 3 (c), 4 (d), 5 (e),
and 6 (f).

UV–Vis Diffuse Reflectance Property and Calculation of
Optical Band Gap
Compounds 1–6 are formed by identical organic cations as a template for the formation
of a supramolecular structure, and their UV–vis diffuse reflectance
diagrams are shown in Figure 7. There is a UV absorption peak at 200–300 nm, indicating
that characteristic peaks are generated by π → π*
transition of the organic cation. UV absorption of each compound is
different after 300 nm because they have different metal centers and
a difference in charge transition (MLCT) between metal centers and
ligand occurs.

Figure 7 UV–vis diffuse reflectance diagrams of compounds 1–6.

The forbidden bandwidth is called the optical band gap (indicated
by Eg), which is an important parameter
for judging semiconductor materials. In this experiment, the corresponding
band gap values were calculated by measuring UV–vis of compounds 1–6. First, the reflectance R and the wavelength λ (nm) are obtained by scanning with an
ultraviolet spectrophotometer. The ordinate is according to the Kubelka–Munk
(K–M)41 equation: F = (1 – R)2/2R, and the abscissa is according to the energy formula Eg = hc/λ. Then, the curve of K–M
versus E, the energy value corresponding to the intersection
of the tangent and the abscissa at the maximum slope of the curve,
is the band gap value of the compound.42 The optical absorption associated with Eg can be assessed at 1.7109 ± 0.01, 2.0031 ± 0.01, 2.1686
± 0.01, 2.8282 ± 0.01, 1.8514 ± 0.01, and 1.8413 ±
0.01 eV for 1–6, respectively (Figure S4). This indicates that these compounds
are expected to be semiconductors when exposed to visible light and
have potential photocatalytic activity.43,44 Besides, 1 has the potential capacity for efficient sunlight harvesting
because the maximum photon flux of sunlight is around 1.7 eV.45

Photocatalytic Properties
Recently,
much attention
has been paid to the decomposition of organic compounds by a semiconductor
catalyst to purify waste water.46,47 We studied the photocatalytic
degradation behavior of compounds 1–6 on extensively used organic dyes such as methylene blue (MB) under
visible light irradiation using a 500 W xenon lamp. The reaction solution
was centrifuged, and the sample solution (3–4 mL) was detected
at different times (0, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min,
respectively) (Figure S5). After filtration,
the concentration of MB was detected by UV–vis spectrophotometry
(λmax = 663 nm). As shown in Figure 8, It can be seen that photodegradation activities
increase from 3% (without any catalyst) to 82.33% for 1, 69.51% for 2, 62.55% for 3, 51.36% for 4, 23.76% for 5, and 20.18% for 6. So compounds 1–6 have the ability
of catalytically degrading the organic dye MB. Compound 1 shows high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB, which
may result from its small band gap value among those of compounds 1–6.

Conclusions
In
this article, we successfully synthesized six new low-dimensional
inorganic–organic hybrid supramolecules using an imidazole
macrocyclic divalent cation-templated self-assembly. The conformation
immobilization of cyclophane cation was realized through different
metal anions’ recognition. Organic cation adapted to different
anions by rotation of the imidazole ring and ring flip of the benzene
rings. The conformation behavior of cyclophane in them was that the
imidazole rings were mutually syn, whereas the benzene rings were
mutually syn in compounds 3–5 or
mutually anti in compounds 1, 2, and 6. Exo-syn/syn and endo-syn/syn conformations coexisted in
compounds 3–4. The photocatalytic
properties of these compounds were studied, and they exhibit a certain
degradation effect on organic dye MB. Compound 1 with
syn/anti-cation conformation has the best degradation performance.

Supramolecular Syntheses and Conformation Immobilization
Synthesis
of {[did](CdI4)(C2H3N)} (1)
Compounds 1–6 were prepared
by solvothermal synthesis method. For compound 1, 1.5
mL of CH3CN solution of did·2PF6 (0.01
g) was added into CdI2 (0.01 g) dissolved
in 1.5 mL of CH3CN with excess KI. The mixture was constantly
stirred and reacted at 80 °C for 72 h and then cooled to room
temperature within 14 h. Colorless transparent needle-shaped crystals
of 1 were obtained with yield of 40%. IR (KBr, cm–1): 3530.69(w), 3125.29(m), 3066.93(m), 1553.40(s),

Synthesis of {[did](HgI4)(C2H3N)} (2)

was maintained for 96 h and dropped to room temperature within 24

X-ray Crystallography Study
The X-ray single-crystal
diffraction data of compounds 1–6 were recorded on the Bruckner SMART CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromatic
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293 K. Data reduction
and absorption correction were done using the SADABS software package.
After absorption correction, SHELXTL-97, OLEX-2 and other packages
were employed for analysis. The main bond lengths of the crystallographic
data of compounds 1–6 are shown in Tables S1 and S2. The purity of compounds 1–6 was studied by X-ray powder diffraction
(PXRD). Simulation of the PXRD spectra was carried out by the single-crystal
data and diffraction-crystal module of the Mercury (Hg) program available
free of charge via the internet at http://www.iucr.org.
