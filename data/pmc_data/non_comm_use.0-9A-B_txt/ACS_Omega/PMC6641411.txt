An azo-linked covalent
organic polymer, Py-azo-COP, was synthesized
by employing a highly blue-fluorescent pyrene derivative that is multiply
substituted with bulky isopropyl groups. Py-azo-COP was investigated
for its sensing and gas adsorption properties. Py-azo-COP shows selective
sensing toward the electron-deficient polynitroaromatic compound picric
acid among the many other competing analogs that were investigated. Apart from its chemosensing ability, Py-azo-COP (surface area 700
m2 g–1) exhibits moderate selectivity
toward adsorption of CO2 and stores up to 8.5 wt % of CO2 at 1 bar and 18.2 wt % at 15.5 bar at 273 K, although this
is limited due to the electron-rich −N=N– linkages
being flanked by isopropyl groups. Furthermore, the presence of a
large number of isopropyl groups imparts hydrophobicity to Py-azo-COP,
as confirmed by the increased adsorption of toluene compared to that
of water in the pores of the COP.

Introduction
Covalent organic polymers
(COPs) have gained increased attention
during recent years due to their high porosity, low mass density,
tunable structural properties, and more importantly, their unique
physicochemical stability arising from the entirely covalently bonded
networks.1 COPs have distinguished themselves
as a new class of materials for potential applications in catalysis,
gas storage and separation, chemosensing, and in drug delivery.1,2 In particular, the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in
the environment due to anthropogenic activities poses challenges to
design new porous materials for its effective and efficient sequestration.3 The amine solution employed in industry for the
capture and sequestration of CO2 demands high energy for
regeneration, and is further complicated by the corrosive nature of
the alkaline solutions toward equipment.4 Although porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) possess high crystallinity
and exhibit remarkable CO2 adsorption properties, the harsh
chemical environments of industry necessitate the development of other
classes of porous sorbents. Microporous COPs, though amorphous in
nature, can show remarkable stability toward acidic and alkaline environments,
and thermal treatment.1 By proper tuning
of the porosity parameters such as surface area, pore volume, and
pore width, COPs can be biased toward high CO2 uptake and
selectivity (CO2 vs N2). COPs with various functional
groups or linkages have been investigated for their selective adsorption
properties, however, the search for a favorable material to overcome
the challenges of both selectivity and high capacity is still on.
The introduction of CO2-philic functional groups such as
aminals,5 amines,6 imines,7 triazine,2a,3d,3e and benzimidazole7a,8 in
the COP framework is an alternative way to enhance CO2/N2 selectivity and loading capacity.

Because of their
tunable organic framework, COPs can be manipulated
to carry optically active functionalities. For example, material chemists
in the last few years have started designing π-conjugated luminescent
materials for use in various applications such as light harvesting,
light-emitting diodes, chemosensors, etc.9 One such chemosensing application is the sensing of polynitroaromatic
compounds (PNACs).10 Devices and explosives
derived from PNACs pose a great threat to national security in an
era of rising terrorism-related activities and are also harmful to
human health and the environment.11 Several
analytical methodologies have been developed for sensing nitroaromatic
explosives. However, many are found to be expensive and cumbersome.
On the contrary, fluorescent-based probes offer high sensitivity,
portability, and real-time monitoring at low cost.12,13 The best reported chemosensors for this purpose are the π-conjugated
systems, which utilize perturbation in fluorescence as the signaling
mechanism.7a,10a,14 Picric acid (PA) (or 2,4,6-trinitrophenol) is more explosive than
trinitrotoluene, although it finds useful applications as a reagent
in the dye, pharmaceutical, and leather industries. Further, it poses
severe risks to human health as an allergen and is known to affect
the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, kidneys, urinary
system, and liver.15 It is also considered
to be a potential carcinogen.16 In addition,
PA, being water soluble, easily pollutes ground water and soil. Although
most porous polymers (such as COPs) possess significant π-conjugation
and structural similarities with π-conjugated fluorescent organic
polymers, research on COPs has primarily focused on tuning the porosity
and high gas uptake, whereas studies on the photophysical properties
associated with sensing of PNACs are still in the early stages. While
most MOFs or COFs employed for the chemosensing of PNACs lack hydrothermal
stability, COPs usually possess better hydrothermal constancy.

Pyrene, a polycyclic π-conjugated molecule, being an excellent
fluorophore with long fluorescence lifetimes and a high quantum yield,
may serve as a good starting point to develop COPs for the simultaneous
applications of CO2 capture and nitroaromatics detection.17 In this context, we developed a new azo-linked
porous COP based on a pyrene platform appended with sterically encumbered
aniline and investigated its suitability as a chemosensor and CO2 adsorption material. The details of this study are presented
herein.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
A
pyrene substituted
with four 2,6-diisopropylaniline rings, 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(4′-amino-3′,5′-diisopropylphenyl)pyrene
(TADIPPy) (Scheme 1), was chosen as the monomer for the preparation of the azo-linked
COP in the present study. The bulky isopropyl substituents were placed
on the aniline part of the pyrene monomer for two reasons: (i) to
increase the stability of the resultant COP toward water, acids, and
bases through the expanded hydrophobic surface, and (ii) to enhance
nitroaromatics detection and CO2 adsorption by taking advantage
of the ability of these bulky substituents to make the surface of
the pores electron rich. This also ensured high CO2/N2 selectivity through enhanced Lewis acid–base interactions
with –N=N- linkages.3f,18

Scheme 1 Synthesis of TADIPPy
(2)
The synthesis of the tetradiisopropylaniline-appended
derivative
of pyrene, TADIPPy, was accomplished starting from (4-((diphenylmethylene)amino)-3,5-diisopropyl-phenyl)-boronic
acid19 and 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene.20 The monomer 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(4′-amino-3′,5′-diisopropylphenyl)pyrene
(TADIPPy) (2), was synthesized by Suzuki–Miyaura
cross coupling of amine-protected boronic acid with 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene
followed by deprotection of the ketamine (1) through
hydrolysis using dilute hydrochloric acid in tetrahydrofuran (THF)
and subsequent neutralization with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution
(Scheme 1). The polymer
Py-azo-COP (3) was synthesized by the CuBr catalyzed
homocoupling reaction of 2 using a catalytic amount of
pyridine in a THF/toluene solvent mixture (v/v = 1:1) using air as
the oxidant (Scheme 2).21 The reddish-brown precipitate obtained
after the reaction was washed thoroughly with water and THF, soaked
in concentrated HCl for 24 h, and then washed with 2 N aqueous NaOH.
The product was then washed with copious amounts of water and ethanol.
The sample was activated through solvent exchange with CHCl3 and dried under vacuum for 12 h at 120 °C. TADIPPy and Py-azo-COP
were exhaustively characterized by spectroscopic and analytical methods.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Py-azo-COP
(3)
The optical characteristics of the building units, 1 and 2, were established from absorption spectroscopy.
The absorption spectra of 1 and 2 show a
red shift of approximately 70–80 nm from that of the simple
pyrene (Figures S11 and S13). This large
bathochromic shift can arise due to multiple reasons. First, the introduction
of steric 2,6-diisopropylphenylamine groups at the 1, 3, 6, and 8
positions of the pyrene molecule is expected to lower the molecular
planarity and symmetry. Secondly, the lone pair of electrons on the
nitrogen atom of the amine groups conjugates with the aromatic system
by donating its electron density to the aryl rings. This kind of bathochromic
shift has been observed in many amine derivatives.22 Whereas 1 does not exhibit any observable
fluorescence (Figure S12), 2 exhibits a strong blue fluorescence (Figure S15) with a high quantum yield (0.92, standard = quinine sulfate
in 0.1 M H2SO4) and a lifetime of 2.8 ns in
THF solution (Figure S17). Although the
absorption spectra of 1 and 2 as a neat
film exhibit a small red shift (Figures S14 and S16), the emission spectrum of 2 as a neat film
show a bathochromic shift of 17 nm compared to that in the solution
phase, which can be understood due to the aggregation behavior in
the solid state (Figure S16). Solid state
CP-MAS 13C NMR spectroscopy of Py-azo-COP showed signals
from the −C–N=N–C– linkage at ∼147 ppm in the CP-MAS 13C
NMR spectrum (Figures 1 and S7), along with signals that correspond
to other carbon atoms in the repeating unit of the polymer. In the
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of 3, bands
were observed at 1166 and 1444 cm–1, which can be
attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of the −N=N–
bond (Figure S1). The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) of the activated Py-azo-COP shows a marginal weight
loss on heating under a dry nitrogen stream that is most likely due
to the presence of adsorbed gases, moisture, or low molecular weight
residual impurities (Figure S8).18a This is followed by slow decomposition on further
heating. The amorphous nature of Py-azo-COP was confirmed by powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Figure S9) and further by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure S10).

Detection of PA
The fluorescent pyrene moieties in
this azo-linked polymer, Py-azo-COP, provide a suitable platform for
the active detection of various kinds of electron-deficient nitroaromatic
explosives by a fluorescent quenching response. Application of this
kind of fluorescent porous architecture for the detection of nitroaromatic
explosives is on the rise.23 The fluorescence
spectrum of Py-azo-COP uniformly dispersed in THF exhibits a red shift
(relative to the monomer 2) with broad greenish emission
at around 485 nm, which tails up to 650 nm due extended π-conjugation
in the polymer (Figure S19). The fluorescence
quenching abilities of various analytes were investigated by dispersing
Py-azo-COP in THF followed by sonication for 10 min.

Five different
electron-deficient nitroaromatic compounds (PA, dinitrotoluene (DNT), p-dinitrobenzene (p-DNB), m-dinitrobenzene (m-DNB), and nitrobenzene (NB))
were employed in the fluorescence quenching studies. In addition to
these nitroaromatics, the dispersion of Py-azo-COP was also titrated
with electron-deficient molecules such as nitromethane (NM), hexafluorobenzene
(HFB), and pentafluorophenol (PFP) to evaluate the selectivity. In
all of the titrations, the fluorophore was excited at 415 nm. The
fluorescence of Py-azo-COP was quenched by the successive addition
of nitroaromatic compounds with different concentrations. Interestingly,
the fluorescence was quenched more significantly (60% after the addition
of 0.96 mM) by PA, compared to that of the other nitroaromatic compounds
(Figure 2). The fluorescence
intensity of Py-azo-COP diminished marginally after the addition of m-DNB and DNT whereas a slight decrease in intensity was
observed after the addition of p-DNB. This selective
detection of PA is highly promising for any practical application.

the solid lines are fits from the Stern–Volmer model. (c) Percentage

analytes (after addition of 0.96 mM). (d) Luminescence photographs
of the dispersion of Py-azo-COP in THF and of Py-azo-COP with various
analytes excited using a portable UV lamp (λ = 365 nm).

The quenching efficiency of Py-azo-COP
toward various analytes
was measured by employing the Stern–Volmer model (Figure 2b). The obtained
Stern–Volmer constant KSV was found
to follow the order PA ≫ p-DNB ∼ DNT
∼ m-DNB ∼ NB ≫ NM, HFB, PFP
for Py-azo-COP (Figure 2b and Table S3), and was moderate compared
to those of the fluorophores reported for PA sensing (Table S6). The linear Stern–Volmer correlation
observed suggests a static quenching mechanism is operating. To further
confirm this, a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) experiment
was conducted at the emission wavelength of 485 nm and excitation
wavelength of 440 nm in THF. Py-azo-COP exhibits a biexponential decay
with an average lifetime of 1.7 ns. After the addition of PA to Py-azo-COP,
the lifetime remains almost unaffected (τ0/τ
= 1), which indicates static quenching via ground state dark complex
formation (Figures 3a and S21 and Table S4).17b,23a Further, to ascertain the effectiveness of PA in quenching the fluorescence
of Py-azo-COP in the presence of other PNACs, an additional set of
experiments were performed. PA was added at regular intervals while
titrating Py-azo-COP with other PNACs. As can be seen in Figure 3b, when PA is added
during successive addition of other PNACs, there is a sharp decrease
in fluorescence intensity, signifying the selectivity of Py-azo-COP
toward PA.

the decays are included as solid lines (green). (b) Efficiency of
PA quenching of Py-azo-COP in the presence of other analytes. Red
circles indicate addition of PA instead of other PNACs.

Gas/Solvent Adsorption Measurements
The porosity of
Py-azo-COP was investigated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption
measurements. The N2 isotherm of Py-azo-COP at 77 K (Figure 4) exhibits a typical
type I isotherm with rapid N2 uptake at very low partial
pressures (0.0–0.1 bar) indicating predominant microporosity.
Further, a slender hysteresis observed in the low pressure region
suggests the presence of some mesopores in the Py-azo-COP framework.
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of Py-azo-COP
was estimated to be 700 m2 g–1, which
is comparable to other known azo-linked polymers (Table S5).3f,18,21,24 To evaluate the pore size distribution (PSD),
a nonlocal density functional theory method was used to fit the adsorption
branch of the nitrogen isotherm. The PSD study shows that Py-azo-COP
has three major peaks at 11.6, 14.8, and 19.7 Å (Figure 4, inset). This is due to the
rampant formation of pores during polymerization. The pore volume
of Py-azo-COP was calculated from the nitrogen gas adsorbed at P/P0 = 0.99 to be 0.41 cc g–1. The above results suggest that the pores in Py-azo-COP
would be accessible for hosting various guest molecules such as CO2, H2, etc.

at 77 K. Inset: PSD.

Because of its high thermal stability, micro/mesoporosity,
and
the presence of ample number of CO2-philic azo linkages,
Py-azo-COP was investigated for selective CO2 adsorption.
The CO2 isotherms measured at 273 and 298 K up to 1 bar
were found to be completely reversible, exhibiting an uptake capacity
of 8.5 wt % at 273 K (Figure 5a). This value of CO2 uptake is moderate as compared
to those of previously reported azo-linked polymers (see Table S5). The azo-linked polymers constructed
with flat aromatic platforms show higher selectivity toward CO2 due to the presence of −N=N– moieties
and π-clouds in the polymer framework, thereby imparting N2-phobic character to the material. However, in the present
scenario, the presence of a large number of isopropyl groups that
flank the −N=N– functionalities considerably
reduce the affinity of the polymer toward CO2.

component isotherm adsorption for CO2, N2, and
H2 at 273 K showing higher selectivity for CO2. (c) Isosteric heat of adsorption for CO2 uptake. (d)
Comparative plot for water (red) and toluene (green) vapor uptake
capacities of Py-azo-COP.

At zero coverage, the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) calculated from the Classius–Clayeperon
equation
is 25.8 kJ mol–1, derived from the adsorption data
collected at 273 and 298 K (Figure 5c), which is comparable to those of previously reported
azo-linked porous polymers (Table S5).
The unsaturation of CO2 uptake capacity at 1 bar prompted
us to measure the CO2 uptake at higher pressure. The high
pressure adsorption measurements show that CO2 adsorption
saturates at 18.2 wt % at 273 K and 15.5 bar and at 16.6 wt % at 298
K and 22.0 bar (Figures S26–S27).
Although the −N=N– functionalities in the polymer
are flanked by isopropyl groups, Py-azo-COP shows higher selectivity
toward CO2 adsorption as compared to that toward N2 and H2 at 273 and 298 K (Figures 5b and S25). The
H2 sorption isotherms are completely reversible, indicating
that the interaction between H2 and Py-azo-COP is weak.
The observed uptake of H2 at 77 K and 1 bar is 1.02 wt
% (Figure S24).

Ideal adsorbed solution
theory (IAST) was used to analyze selectivity
in binary mixture compositions of CO2/N2 (15:85)
and CO2/H2 (20:80) utilizing the experimental
single-component isotherms collected at 273 and 298 K.25 From a single-site Langmuir equation, the selectivity
of the CO2/N2 (15:85) binary gas mixture at
273 and 298 K (1 bar) was calculated to be 11.9 and 28.6, respectively
(Figure 6). These values
are moderate compared to those of other reported azo-COPs (Table S5), and can be understood from the presence
of isopropyl groups in the vicinity of the azo linkages. The selectivity
of the CO2/H2 (20:80) binary gas mixture at
273 and 298 K (1 bar) was found to be 45.0 and 63.1, respectively.
CO2/N2 selectivity was also calculated from
the pure component isotherms of N2 and CO2 by
an initial slope calculation method (Henry’s law) (Figures S28 and S29). It was found that CO2/N2 selectivity was 41.5 and 37.3 at 273 and 298
K, respectively.

Figure 6 (a) CO2/N2 and (b) CO2/H2 selectivity of Py-azo-COP measured by IAST technique
for CO2/N2 gas mixture of 15:85 and CO2/H2 gas mixture of 20:80 at 273 and 298 K, respectively.

To investigate the low uptake
of CO2 by Py-azo-COP due
to the presence of a large number of isopropyl groups, water and toluene
vapor adsorption measurements were performed (Figure 5d). The interaction between polar water molecules
and Py-azo-COP is weak, which can be seen from the shape of the water
isotherm (type III) accommodating 3.5 wt % of water vapor (Figure 5d).26 In contrast, the toluene uptake capacity of Py-azo-COP
is 20.8 wt % (6 times that of water uptake), which indicates its hydrophobic
nature. The toluene isotherm has a typical type I profile, and the
uptake saturates at P/P0 ∼ 0.24, which indicates very strong interaction with the
material. The presence of the alkyl group and π-cloud in the
framework is most likely the primary reason for the high uptake capacity
for toluene compared to that of water. CO2/H2O selectivity for the Py-azo-COP was found to be 3.1 (Figure S30).

Conclusions
We
designed and synthesized Cu(I)-mediated pyrene-based fluorescent
Py-azo-COP, which exhibits (a) significant porosity with a high surface
area of 700 m2 g–1, (b) stability, and
(c) high pore volume. The inherent fluorescent nature of Py-azo-COP
led to the efficient and selective sensing of PA among other polynitroaromatic
compounds such as DNT, p-DNB, and m-DNB, and other electron-deficient molecules. Because of the azo
group’s CO2-philic nature, Py-azo-COP exhibits a
CO2 adsorption uptake of about 8.5 wt % of CO2 at 273 K (up to 1 bar), which increases significantly to 18.2 wt
% at 15.5 bar at the same temperature. However, the presence of isopropyl
groups around the electron-rich azo linkages is detrimental to CO2/N2 selectivity. The present results suggest that
it would be interesting to investigate the gas sorption properties
and sensing capabilities of structurally similar COPs, specifically
by removing the bulky isopropyl substituents for further increased
porosity and possibly higher sensing capabilities. Work in this direction
is currently underway.

Caution:PA, DNB, and DNT are sensitive to external stimuli such
as shock, heat, electromagnetic radiation, static electricity, etc.
Although we did not face any kind of problems while working with them,
it is highly advisable to handle these materials with due care.

the compounds to the sample holder.

Field Emission Gun Scanning
Electron Microscopy (FEG-SEM)
The morphology of Py-azo-COP
was studied using FEG-SEM on a JEOL
model JSM-7600F FEG-SEM operating at an accelerating voltage of 0.1–30
kV. The sample was prepared by drop casting the powdered sample onto
a carbon substrate. The samples were sputtered with platinum prior
to imaging.

Photophysical Studies
The UV–vis
and fluorescence
spectra of the building blocks (monomers) and Py-azo-COP were recorded
at room temperature in THF solution and in suspension, respectively.
One milligram of powdered Py-azo-COP was suspended in THF (5 mL) and
sonicated for 10 min to obtain a homogeneous dispersion. The fluorescence
spectra of the suspensions were measured by successive addition of
polynitroaromatic analytes, keeping an excitation and emission slit
width of 10 and 10 nm, respectively. Py-azo-COP was excited at 415
nm. The emission intensity (I) was plotted against
wavelength to obtain quenching profiles. The values of the Stern–Volmer
constant (KSV) were calculated by fitting
the fluorescence data to the following equation.  where I0 is the
fluorescence intensity in the absence of the analyte, I is the fluorescence intensity in the presence of the analyte, and KSV is the Stern–Volmer constant. The
Stern–Volmer curves were obtained by plotting (I0/I) versus analyte concentration. The
slope of the curves yielded KSV.

The time-resolved fluorescence decays were collected with the emission
polarizer at a magic angle of 54.7° and analyzed by IBH DAS v6.2
software. The full width at half-maximum of the instrument response
function was 679 ps and the resolution was 56 ps per channel. The

Synthesis of TADIPPy (2)
Compound 1 (1.560 g, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in THF
(20 mL) and HCl
(2 N, 20 mL) was added. After the solution was stirred at 60 °C
for 12 h, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The white
solid was thoroughly washed with diethyl ether and cold THF to remove
the generated benzophenone and the hydrochloride salt was dried under
vacuum. To a suspension of the salt in diethyl ether (50 mL), an aqueous
NaOH solution (1.0 N, 50 mL) was added and stirred for 6 h at room
temperature. The mixture was then extracted with diethyl ether. The
ether extracts were collected and the product was further extracted
from the water phase with additional diethyl ether (30 mL). The organic
phase was combined and dried with anhydrous MgSO4. The
solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator to give a yellow solid
as the free amine. Yield: 0.52 g (90%), mp > 250 °C. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ 8.22 (s, 2H), 8.06
(s,
4H), 7.40 (s, 8H), 3.87 (s, 8H), 3.05 (sep, 8H), 1.35 (d, J = 6.6 Hz, 48H) ppm. 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100.61 MHz): δ 139.7, 137.9, 132.6, 131.6, 129.5, 127.9,

Synthesis
of Py-azo-COP (3)
To a solution
of 2 (280 mg, 0.30 mmol) in a mixture of THF/toluene
(v/v = 1:1, 30 mL), CuBr (21.5 mg, 0.150 mmol) and pyridine (83 mg,
10.5 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred under ambient
aerobic conditions for 24 h followed by heating at 80 °C for
2 days. The dark red reaction mixture was filtered and washed with
excess THF and water. The dark red powder thus obtained was treated
with aqueous HCl (100 mL, 4 M) for 24 h and then filtered and washed
with distilled water. The dried powder was then further washed with
aqueous NaOH (200 mL, 1 M) followed by further washing with distilled
water and ethanol. Yield: 205 mg (74%), mp > 250 °C. FT-IR
(KBr,
cm–1): 3404 (br), 2959 (vs), 2926 (s), 2871 (s),
1622 (s), 1600 (s), 1461 (vs), 1444 (s), 1384 (m), 1299 (w), 1250
(w), 1217 (w), 1166 (m), 1101 (m), 1068 (w), 882 (m). Anal. Calcd
for C64H70N4: C, 85.86; H, 7.88;
N, 6.26. Found: C, 78.86; H, 7.02; N, 5.23. The difference between
the observed and theoretical elemental analysis values is common among
porous organic polymers and is caused by incomplete polymerization
as well as the adsorption of water and gas molecules. This was further
confirmed by the initial weight loss of about 15% below 100 °C
in the TGA.
