The assay of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is important
in clinical
diagnosis because the abnormal expression of this enzyme is related
to many serious diseases. In this work, using a luminescent metal–organic
framework (MOF) as the sensor, a fluorescent method was developed
for the activity assay of ALP. With nanoscale particle size, the prepared
MOF sensor exhibited good dispersability and stable photoluminescence
in aqueous suspension. The emission of this MOF is inert to p-nitrophenylphosphate (NPP) but could be efficiently quenched
by its dephosphorylated product, p-nitrophenol. Taking
advantage of this feature, this MOF was added to the system of ALP-catalyzed
NPP dephosphorylation to transduce the proceeding of the reaction
real-timely to the fluorescent signal. The enzyme activity could be
calculated based on the recorded kinetic trace. This method presented
a low detection limit (2 × 10–3 U L–1) and a wide quantification range (0.6–90 U L–1) in our experiments, showing its quantification capability challenges
the best of current ALP analytical methods. As a practical application,
our method was successfully applied to the ALP analysis in human serum
samples.

==== Body
Introduction
Alkaline phosphatases (ALPs) are a group
of isoenzymes that catalyze
hydrolysis and transphosphorylation of monophosphates. This kind of
enzymes distribute widely in mammalian tissues and participate in
a series of important physiological processes.1 Clinically, serum ALP activity is routinely used as a diagnostic
biomarker for several serious diseases, including breast and prostatic
cancers,2,3 bone disease,4 liver dysfunction,5 and diabetes.6 Because of its importance, various methods have
been proposed for the activity measurement of ALP.7−12 Among these methods, fluorometric assay shows great potential because
of its intrinsic advantages in sensitivity, operability, and instrument
requiring. Until now, different kinds of fluorescent sensors, including
organic molecules8,9 and inorganic nanomaterials,10−12 have been applied to the activity assay of ALP.

As a novel
kind of inorganic-organic hybrid materials, metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) have shown great potential in fluorescent sensing
during the past decade.13 Besides structural
flexibility and porosity, MOFs also present low cytotoxicity and biodegradability,
which makes these kinds of materials extremely suitable for biological
analysis, particularly for the enzyme assay.14 With different responses to the substrate and the product, the MOF
sensor could transduce the proceeding of enzymatic reaction to fluorescent
signal real-timely. Recently, several research groups, including ours,
have developed a number of successful MOF-based sensing systems for
the activity measurement of different kinds of enzymes.15−17 These systems usually exhibit high sensitivity and can distinguish
the target enzymes from a series of interfering species.

In
this work, a luminescent MOF (In-atp) with particle size in
the nanoscale was synthesized. The study about the fluorescent response
of this material showed that its emission is insusceptible to monophosphate
but could be efficiently quenched by the hydrolysis product. With
this response difference, this MOF was successfully applied to the
activity assay of ALP.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of In-atp
In-atp was obtained as white
powder from the reaction between deprotonated 2-aminoterephthalic
acid (H2atp) and InCl3 in the mixed solvent
of dimethylformamide (DMF)/H2O (v/v = 4/1, Figure 1a). The coordination structure
of the product was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD).
Well-defined diffraction peaks recorded in the pattern shows the good
crystallinity of the sample (Figure 1b). The positions of these peaks are consistent with
the simulated pattern from the In analogue of MIL-68 (constructed
with the ligand of terephthalic acid),18 indicating that our sample is isostructural with it. In the Fourier
transform infrared spectrum (Figure S1),
the carboxyl groups give doublet peaks at 1556 and 1425 cm–1, while no characteristic absorption band is observed in the range
of 1690–1730 cm–1, indicating the complete
deprotonation of H2atp upon the construction of In-atp.
Elemental and thermogravimetric analyses (Figure S2) of In-atp gave the empirical formula of [In(atp)(OH)]·0.5H2O. These results further confirm the network structure determined
by PXRD. In this framework, the carboxyl groups of atp2– ligands coordinate with In3+ ions to construct the backbone
of MOFs, while their amino groups are left free to work as auxochromes.
The residual coordination sites of In3+ are saturated by
OH– ions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation
showed that the obtained sample is composed of irregular shaped particles
with size in the range of 100–200 nm (Figure 1c). This small particle size is good for
the dispersability of MOF in the suspension.

of the synthetic process, (b) PXRD pattern,
and (c) SEM image of In-atp.

Photoluminescence Property and Response
With fluorescent
atp2– as the ligand and closed-shell In3+ as the metal node, In-atp is promising in terms of photoactivity.
The photoluminescence of In-atp was directly examined with its aqueous
suspension (to be the same as the following enzyme assay experiments,
Tris-HCl buffer was added to maintain the pH at 8.0). As expected,
In-atp gave a ligand-centered fluorescence band with the maximum at
429 nm (Figure 2a).
The emission intensity of the MOF is nearly three times higher than
that of the free H2atp ligand. However, the fluorescence
quantum yield of In-atp (44.3%) did not show such high increase
extent (32.0% for H2atp). The suspension exhibited good
stability under experimental conditions. Placed in the cuvette of
fluorescence measurement, its emission showed no noticeable change
in 30 min (Figure S3), which is long enough
for normal kinetic measurements. We also tested the effect of medium
pH on the fluorescence spectrum and observed that the emission intensity
of In-atp gave a plateau in the pH range of 7–11 (Figure S4). This range covers the optimal pHs
of the ALPs from different origins (8–10),19−21 illustrating
the suitability of In-atp for the analysis of this kind of enzyme.

versus reaction extent, cNPP + cNP = 100 μM.

We selected p-nitrophenylphosphate
(NPP), which
is commonly used in the colorimetric assay of ALP, as the substrate
for enzymatic reaction. First, we tested the fluorescent responses
of In-atp to this compound and its dephosphorylated product, p-nitrophenol (NP) (Figures 2b and S5). It was observed
that, although both NPP and NP could induce the fluorescence weakening
of In-atp, the quenching efficiency of NP is much higher than that
of the substrate. For example, the emission of In-atp was nearly completely
quenched (87%) upon the addition of 100 μM NP, while the same
amount of NPP can only induce a small quenching percentage of 22%.
We attribute the higher quenching efficiency of NP to a resonance
energy transfer mechanism because the absorption of NPP exhibits a
large redshift upon dephosphorylation. As shown in Figure 2c, in contrast to the substrate,
the absorption spectrum of NP (with the maximum at 399 nm and extending
to 490 nm) overlaps much with the emission band of In-atp, so both
Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and inner filter effect
(IFE) are possible to happen in this sensing system. We used the equation
proposed by Parker to evaluate the contributions of these two processes.22,23 1  

In this equation, Iobsd is the observed
intensity, Icor is the corrected intensity
deducting IEF, Aex and Aem are respectively the quencher absorbances at the excitation
and emission wavelengths, and d (1 cm), g (0.4 cm), and s (0.1 cm) are the parameters depending
upon the geometry of the measurement. As shown in Figure S6, Icor is located between Iobsd and original intensity, showing that both
two mechanisms contribute to the quenching process. Based on the position
of the Icor plot, we estimated that ∼40%
of the observed fluorescent quenching is induced by FRET and the remaining
60% is caused by IEF.

It is noteworthy that the fluorescent
measurements were carried
out at pH = 8.0 and the pKa of NP is 7.15,
which means that NP would be deprotonated in the suspension. As discussed
above, the framework of In-atp is rich of coordinating OH– ions, which provides potential protonation sites to make the MOFs
positively charged. This deduction was confirmed by the dynamic light
scattering measurement of In-atp suspension, which gave a positive
zeta potential of 25.6 mV. With opposite charges, electrostatic attraction
would exist between the MOF backbone and NP, and this effect would
induce the enrichment of NP. Adsorption experiments confirmed this
anticipation (Figure S7). In the concentration
range of 0–130 μM (covering the range used in enzyme
assays), the adsorption amount of NP is proportional to its equilibrium
concentration. Based on this adsorption isotherm and the structure
of In-atp, we calculated that the local concentration of NP could
reach 358 times higher than its concentration in equilibrium solution.
Because the FRET efficiency is dependent on the distance between the
donor and the acceptor, this high enrichment ratio greatly enhances
the response sensitivity.

Activity Assay of ALP
Because the ALP-catalyzed dephosphorylation
of NPP is quantitative and releases the product with higher quenching
efficiency, it is expected that, if In-atp were added to the reaction
system, its emission would weaken with the proceeding of the reaction.
Because the quenching percentages of NPP and NP showed the biggest
difference at 100 μM (Figure 2b), we chose it as the initial concentration of NPP
to maximize the fluorescence change. Considering that the formed PO43– ion during the enzymatic reaction could
potentially induce the decomposition of MOFs, we evaluated the stability
of In-atp in the aqueous solutions with different PO43– concentrations. As shown in Figure S8, the immersed In-atp maintained its crystallinity when the
PO43– concentration was below 200 μM.
Therefore, at 100 μM of initial substrate concentration, the
formed PO43– cannot induce the collapse
of the MOF sensor. With the addition of 4 mg L–1 ALP, the emission of In-atp presented a continuous quenching in
the first 500 s and then leveled off, indicating that the dephosphorylation
had gone to completion (Figure 3a). The PXRD pattern of the used sensor showed that its structure
was unchanged (Figure 1b). We also tested the response speeds of In-atp to NPP and NP. In
these experiments, the emission intensities of MOFs were immediately
decreased to a steady value after the addition of these compounds
(Figure S9), which indicates that the responses
of In-atp to NPP and NP are fast enough to follow the enzymatic reaction.
The observed temporal change of In-atp emission in the reaction system
could be treated as a signal to reflect the kinetics of dephosphorylation.

Figure 3 (a) Change
of the fluorescence spectrum of In-atp in the ALP-catalyzed
dephosphorylation system of NPP. (b) Temporal change of In-atp emission
intensity (λem = 429 nm) and the kinetic curve of
the reaction. 50 mg L–1 In-atp, cNPP0 = 100
μM and 4 mg L–1 ALP, in 3 mL Tris-HCl buffer
(20 mM, pH = 8.0).

To determine the reaction rate, we still need the
correlation between
reaction extent and fluorescence intensity. Because the total amount
of NPP and NP was unchanged during enzymatic dephosphorylation, to
simulate the reaction media, we prepared a series of NPP–NP
mixed solutions with the total concentration of 100 μM but different
relative ratios and recorded the fluorescence spectra of In-atp in
these solutions (Figure S10). It was observed
that the logarithm of fluorescence intensity showed a good linear
relationship (R2 = 0.9989) with the concentrations
of NP and NPP (Figure 2d). The calibration curve could be presented as 2  

Considering that the relative measurement
error of fluorescent
intensity was about 0.4%, this equation means that even 0.8 μM
of reaction could be reflected as a remarkable fluorescent signal
(at 3σ level). With this equation, the recorded fluorescence
decay curve could be transduced to the kinetic trace of the enzymatic
reaction (Figure 3b).
By the fitting of the data points in the linear part of the reaction
(R2 = 0.9884), the initial reaction rate
was calculated to be 14 μM min–1. Thus, the
activity of ALP in the reaction system was 14 U L–1.

The accuracy and sensitivity of this assay were evaluated
by the
kinetic measurements of the reactions catalyzed by different concentrations
of ALP [0.17–26 mg L–1 (0.6–90 U L–1), Figure 4a]. The measured initial reaction rates presented a strict
proportional relationship with enzyme amounts (R2 = 0.9907, Figure 4b), proving that our method can precisely reflect the activity
of ALP. With the slope of this fitting line and the measurement error
of the reaction rate, the detection limit for ALP was calculated to
be 2 × 10–3 U L–1 (3σ/k), showing that the sensitivity of this system is superior
to most of the recently reported spectroscopic ALP assay methods (see Table S1 for a literature survey). It should
be noted that the serum ALP levels in adults are generally in the
range of 40–190 U L–1. Even considering the
dilution and pH modulation processes of raw serum samples before measurement,
the wide quantification range and high sensitivity of our method is
still sufficient for clinical diagnosis. Additionally, although several
MOF-based spectroscopic methods have been reported for the activity
assay of ALP, yet all of these systems used phosphate and/or pyrophosphate
ion as the mediator.24−27 The widespread presence of these two species in biological samples
makes these methods susceptible to the matrix effect in practical
analysis. Our method does not suffer from this problem because neither
the substrate NPP nor the product NP is a natural metabolite.

rates measured at different ALP concentrations.

Encouraged by the above results, we further applied
In-atp to the
analysis of real serum samples. The standard addition method was used
in this part of experiments to evaluate the accuracy. Three serum
samples were collected from healthy people. Considering that the quantification
range of our method is 0.6–90 U L–1 and the
normal serum ALP level is 40–190 U L–1, these
samples were diluted with Tris-HCl buffer by 50 times before measurement.
This dilution process also alleviated the effect of serum on the fluorescence
of In-atp (probably due to the components with UV–vis absorption)
to a negligible level. Although the fluorescence of In-atp in pure
serum was much weakened, its emission in 50-fold diluted sample could
reach 93% of the intensity in pure Tris-HCl buffer (Figure S11). After the spiking of a certain volume of standard
enzyme solution, these samples were measured by In-atp. At three different
ALP levels, the relative standard deviations of the repeated measurements
(n = 3) were below 8% and the average recoveries
were in the range of 95.6–102.9%, showing that In-atp is suitable
to analyze these kinds of samples (Table 1).

Conclusions
In summary, a fluorescent method was developed
for the activity
assay of ALP using an atp2– based nanoscale MOF
as sensor. Taking advantage of its stable emission in the suspension
and different responses to NPP and NP, this MOF sensor could transduce
the extent of ALP catalyzed dephosphorylation real-timely to fluorescent
signal. By the scan of this signal, we could follow the kinetics of
the reaction and thus obtain the activity of the enzyme. A low detection
limit of 2 × 10–3 U L–1 and
a wide quantification range of 0.6–90 U L–1 were presented by this method, showing its advantage over the current
ALP assay systems. The results of this work show the wide potential
of MOFs in enzyme assay.

Experimental Section
Reagents and Instrumentation
All chemicals were obtained
commercially and used as received without further purification. The
aqueous suspensions used in fluorescence measurements were prepared
with ultrapure water.

PXRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku
D/Max-2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406
nm) and samples were scanned at 60 kV and 300 mA. Elemental compositions
(C, H, and N) of samples were measured by using a PerkinElmer 240C
analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a
Rigaku standard TG-DTA analyzer from ambient temperature to 700 °C
with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 in the air,
and an empty Al2O3 crucible was used as the
reference. SEM images were taken by using a JEOL JSM-7500F scanning
electron microscope. Steady state fluorescence experiments were carried
out on an Agilent G9800A fluorescence spectrometer, and an SPVF-1X0
accessory was used to control the sample temperature at 25 °C.
A Rikakikai NTT-2200P accessory was used to control the temperature.
Absorption spectra were recorded by using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer.
Zeta potential was measured using a ZETAPALS/BI-200SM analyzer.

Synthesis of In-atp
H2atp (0.045 g) and
NaOH (0.22 g) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of H2O
(5 mL) and DMF (40 mL) and placed in ice bath. Then, 5 mL aqueous
solution of InCl3 (0.11 g) was added dropwise to it under
vigorous stirring. The mixture was stirred for 30 min under cooling
and further reacted for 2.5 h at room temperature. The formed yellow
precipitate of In-atp was separated by centrifugation, washed with
DMF, H2O, and ethanol in sequence, and dried at 60 °C
in air for 12 h. Anal. Calcd. (%) for [In(atp)(OH)]·0.5H2O (Mw = 319.97): C, 30.03; H,

Fluorescent Assay of ALP Activity
The powder of In-atp
(25 mg) was immersed in 500 mL Tris-HCl buffer (20 mM, pH = 8.0) which
contains ZnCl2 (1 mM) and MgCl2 (1 mM). This
mixture was ultrasonicated for 2 h and then left standing for a day
to get a stable suspension (50 mg L–1). Suspension
(3 mL) was placed in a 1 × 1 cm2 optical quartz
cuvette with continuous stirring at 25 °C. After sequential addition
of NPP and ALP, the fluorescence emission of the sample was monitored
continually (λex = 348 nm, λem =
429 nm, the excitation and emission slit widths were both set at 1.5
nm).
