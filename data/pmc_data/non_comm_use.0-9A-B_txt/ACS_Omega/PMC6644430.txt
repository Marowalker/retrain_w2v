We previously reported
that covalently joining an amide-based N-chloramine
with a quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) can
yield a new composite biocide with faster inactivation of various
bacteria. Importantly, the composite biocide was found to reduce the
risk for potential bacterial resistance associated with QAC. However,
similar to other N-chloramines and QACs, this high-performance
composite biocide becomes less potent against pathogenic bacteria
in the presence of high protein fluids. In this study, we substituted
the amide-based N-chloramine moiety in the previously
reported composite biocide with a secondary amine-based N-chloramine to improve the biocidal efficacy in biological fluids.
The N–Cl bond in the synthesized tetramethylpiperidine-based
composite biocides is more stable in a high protein medium (HPM) than
that in the hydantoin (amide)-based composite biocides. The composite
biocide, 2-[4-(1-chloro-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-4-yloxymethyl)-[1,2,3]triazol-1-yl]-ethyl-dodecyl-dimethyl-ammonium
chloride (6a), showed the best antibacterial activity
in both phosphate-buffered saline and HPM among various composite
biocides and benzyldodecyldimethylammonium chloride used in this study.

Introduction
Disinfection of hospital environment and
food processing facilities
has been an indispensable and valuable preventative measure for ensuring
human health. In the context of rising antibiotic resistance and cross-resistance
between antimicrobials and antibiotics,1−3 development of new potent
non-resistance-inducing disinfectants becomes even more pivotal.

Membrane active compounds, such as quaternary ammonium compounds
(QACs), account for a big portion of disinfectants. They have been
widely used in hospitals for infection control and by public for better
hygiene. Reports on bacterial resistance to QACs indicate a concerning
trend.4−7 In 2012, up to 83% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) isolates carry qac resistance genes
in comparison to 10.2% in 1992.4,5 A recent study suggests
that besides QacA efflux pump, membrane mutation also greatly contributes
to bacterial resistance against QACs. Such strategies as creating
multicationic centers have met with certain success in combating bacterial
resistance.8,9 Similarly, covalently joining QACs with
other disinfectants with different modes of action might also serve
as an effective strategy in thwarting bacterial resistance against
QACs.

Recently, we reported the synthesis of a series of composite
biocides
with both quaternary ammonium (QA) and N-chloramine
moieties.10,11 The potential of one composite biocide,
[3-(3-chloro-4,4-dimethyl-2,5-dioxo-imidazolidin-1-yl)-propyl]-dimethyl-tetradecyl-ammonium
chloride (compound 2), and its corresponding precursor,
[3-(4,4-dimethyl-2,5-dioxo-imidazolidin-1-yl)-propyl]-dimethyl-tetradecyl-ammonium
chloride, (compound 1), in inducing bacterial resistance
was studied.12 We were unsuccessful in
isolating Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants
with decreased susceptibility to compound 2 despite arduous
efforts of achieving the goal with two different strategies: recovering
mutants from the zone of clearing and isolating mutants through exposure
to gradually increasing concentrations of biocides. Interestingly,
the presence of N-chloramine moiety in compound 2 seems potentially overcome the risk of selecting mutants
of P. aeruginosa with reduced susceptibility
against the quaternary ammonium part.

The antimicrobial action
of N-chloramines occurs
via different pathways, such as formation of chlorine cover and attack
of the bacterial cell wall proteins, penetration into the bacterial
cell followed by attacking the intracellular vital component. N-chloramines attack various targets in living cells, particularly,
sulfur-containing amino acids, such as cysteine and methionine, interfere
with hydrogen bonding in proteins and affect protein functions governed
by their structures.13,14

On the other hand, the
attraction between the positively charged
nitrogen on QACs and negatively charged head groups of bacterial membrane
phospholipids kicks off the antibacterial action of QACs. As soon
as this bond forms, the long alkyl chain penetrates and integrates
into the membrane core.4 When the concentration
of QAC is high, the bacterial membrane destruction (or hole generation)
occurs due to micelles formation and aggregation.15 Also, QACs can disrupt and denature the structure of proteins
and enzymes.4 Covalently joining a QAC
with an N-chloramine can give a composite biocide
that could inactive bacteria through all of the above-mentioned modes
of action. This can not only minimize the chance of bacterial resistance
but also enhance the overall biocidal activity.

However, disinfectants
often encounter interfering substances,
such as proteins and carbohydrates, while fulfilling their tasks.
Specifically, N-chloramines can be quenched by proteins
through direct contact.16 This challenge
presents a need to develop new antimicrobials, which are more resistant
to interfering substances, such as proteins. Thiol-containing proteins
can reduce N-chloramines and therefore quench their
antimicrobial activity. Also, active chlorine (Cl+) in N-chloramines can transfer to amine, amide, and imide groups
in proteins. In chlorine-transfer reaction (transchlorination), the
oxidation capacity is a good measure for the ability of N-chloramines to exchange chlorine with another amine, amide, and
imide groups. The reactivity of the active chlorine in N-chloramines is in the following order: amines < amides < imides,
and therefore stability of N-chloramines follows
the reverse order.17 The above-mentioned
compound 2 contains an amide-based N-chloramine. Given the following stability sequence of N-chloramines: amines > amides > imides, an amine-based N-chloramine composite biocide was designed in this study
to present
improved antibacterial activity in a high protein medium (HPM) consisting
of 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The proposed mode of action of a composite
biocide with both N-chloramine and QA moieties is
that the composite biocide punches holes in bacterial membrane due
to the QA moiety (mode of action of QACs) and therefore facilitates
the penetration of the whole composite molecule into the bacteria,
allowing its N-chloramine component to exert oxidative
stress inside cells causing fast inactivation of the bacterial cell.
We hypothesized that an amine-based N-chloramine
can better escape the quenching action of proteins and therefore be
preserved to exert oxidative stress inside a bacterial cell to result
a fast kill after the whole biocide gets into the cell through the
holes in the bacterial membrane generated by the QA moiety (Scheme 1). Specifically,
a secondary amine-based N-chloramine was linked to
a QA moiety with an alkyl chain of 12 or 14 methylene units via a
triazole ring linkage, and the antibacterial activity of these compounds
was evaluated against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. This
strategy led us to antimicrobial agents, which may be better suited
for applications with high protein loadings, such as disinfection
of wounds or food contact surfaces (Scheme 1).

Results
Chemistry Synthesis
We previously
demonstrated the
antibacterial enhancement effect of covalently bonding long alkyl
chain QAC moieties to an amide-based N-chloramine
(compound 2 in Scheme 2).10 In this study, we joined
an amine-based N-chloramine to QACs with an alkyl
chain of 12 or 14 carbon atoms (6a, 6b in Scheme 2) with an intention
to improve the antibacterial efficacy of the composite biocide in
the presence of organic matters, such as proteins. [3-(4,4-Dimethyl-2,5-dioxo-imidazolidin-1-yl)-propyl]-dimethyl-tetradecyl-ammonium
chloride (compound 1), dodecyl-dimethyl-{2-[4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-4-yloxymethyl)-[1,2,3]triazol-1-yl]-ethyl}-ammonium
chloride (5a), dimethyl-tetradecyl-{2-[4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-4-yloxymethyl)-[1,2,3]triazol-1-yl]-ethyl}-ammonium
chloride (5b) are the corresponding N-chloramine precursors (i.e., containing only a QA moiety) of the
composite biocide, and benzyldodecyldimethylammonium chloride (BC) was used as a QAC control in antibacterial tests. The
chemical reactions pathway is represented in Scheme 3. An overnight reaction between long chain
alkyl bromides and 2-azido-N,N-dimethyl-ethanamine
led us to azido-functionalized QACs 3a and 3b. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)piperidine 4 was prepared using the method reported by Barnes et al.18 from 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinol. Piperidinol
derivative 4 and two QACs 3a/3b were then linked together via a triazole bridge to get 5a and 5b with Br− counterion. 5a, 5b and compound 1 with Br− counterion were passed through an ion-exchange resin
to replace the counterion Br– with Cl– followed by performing the chlorination reaction using t-BuOCl to obtain {2-[4-(1-chloro-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-4-yloxymethyl)-[1,2,3]triazol-1-yl]-ethyl}-dodecyl-dimethyl-ammonium
chloride (6a), {2-[4-(1-chloro-2,2,6-trimethyl-piperidin-4-yloxymethyl)-[1,2,3]triazol-1-yl]-ethyl}-dimethyl-tetradecyl-ammonium
chloride (6b), and [3-(3-chloro-4,4-dimethyl-2,5-dioxo-imidazolidin-1-yl)-propyl]-dimethyl-tetradecyl-ammonium
chloride (compound 2), respectively.

Copper Analysis
Cu(II) was used
as a catalyst in the
click reaction to link 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin with the long
chain QA moiety. It is known that copper ion possesses antibacterial
activity.19 To avoid unwanted interference
in the antibacterial activity of the new composite biocides, copper
ion was removed by using a chelating column made of Sorbtech CR20-01
beads. Cu327.395 in 5a and 5b was quantified to be 0.13 and 0.075 ppm, respectively. The amount
of Cu324.754 also was measured and appeared to be 0.127
and 0.068 ppm for 5a and 5b. The amount
of copper left in each compound found to be much less than the minimum
concentration of copper required for antibacterial activity, reported
to be 40 ppm by Gyawali et al.20

Redox
Titration
We proceeded to study the stability
of N-chloramines in the HPM (5% FBS in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS)) using a redox titration assay, and the results are presented
in Figure 1. The active
chlorine content of compound 2 (amide-based N-chloramine) dropped to 80% within the first 5 min of contact, and
the chlorine content reached a plateau at around 60% after 60 min.
On the other hand, both 6a and 6b compounds
(amine-based N-chloramines) were significantly more
stable (p < 0.05), and their chlorine content
was still maintained at >80% after 60 min. The loss rate of active
chlorine in HPM was significantly lower (p < 0.05)
for the two amine-based N-chloramines than the amide-based N-chloramine in the first 5 min. These results showed that
the N–Cl bond of secondary amines (6a and 6b) was less reactive with proteins in FBS than that of amides.

medium (HPM). Studies were performed at 23 °C and pH 7.4. Values

Antibacterial Evaluation of the Synthesized Biocides
Table 1 lists the
time needed (total kill (Tk)) for the
antimicrobial agents to inactivate all of the chosen bacteria (total
kill) in different solutions (PBS and HPM). The total kill is claimed
when the bacteria level is equal to or below the 1.82 log detection
limit and equivalent to 4.18 log bacterial reduction with the starting
bacterial concentration of 106 CFU/mL.

a Initial concentration of compounds
in PBS and HPM are 141.0 and 423.1 μM, respectively. n = 3 for all compounds.

As can be found in Table 1, when the medium was changed from PBS to
HPM, increase in Tk for 6a and 6b was
9 min on average, whereas Tk increase
in the case of compound 2 was 16 min (excluding data
of PA01). This means that the deterioration of antimicrobial activity
in the case of piperidine (a secondary amine)-based N-chloramine compounds (6a, 6b) was less
than compound 2. On the other hand, the performance of
compound 2 in PBS was better than compound 1, but their activity was almost the same in HPM, which indicates
that [Cl]+ on compound 2 is reduced in HPM,
and compound 2 is partially converted back to compound 1, as revealed in Figure 1.

Figures 2–5 present the quantitative
antibacterial results
over the contact time against four bacteria in various media. The
composite biocides appeared to be more effective against the Gram-negative
strains (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) than Gram-positive one (MRSA).

biocides and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in the high protein medium (HPM, 5% FBS in PBS) and PBS.
Studies were performed at 23 °C and pH 7.4. Values represent
the mean ± SD. n = 3 for all of the compounds
(the starting inoculum size is indicated in the bracket after each
compound in the legend).

Against MRSA (Figure 2), 6a and compound 2 showed the
best performance
in PBS. As expected, their activity deteriorated in HPM, but the extent
of deterioration varied with antimicrobial agents. Among all biocides
used in this study, compound 1 showed the best antibacterial
activity in HPM.

Biocides demonstrated different antibacterial
behavior against
Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and
MDR P. aeruginosa. The activity of
compound 2 against E. coli significantly dropped (p < 0.05) in HPM in comparison
to PBS (Figure 3).
However, 6a and 6b showed insignificant
change in their activity (p > 0.05) in two media
and were significantly faster in inactivating E. coli in HPM than compound 2 (Tk = 3, 5 versus 20 min). In the case of MDR P. aeruginosa (Figure 4), 6a and 6b illustrated significantly superior
killing than others in the first 5 min (p < 0.05)
in PBS. In HPM, 6a displayed the least decline in their
activity among the chlorinated biocides. compound 1 presented
a slow killing kinetics and the most severe deterioration of antimicrobial
activity in HPM against MDR P. aeruginosa.

biocides and E. coli in the high protein
medium (HPM, 5% FBS in PBS) and PBS. Studies were performed at 23
°C and pH 7.4. Values represent the mean ± SD. n = 3 for all of the compounds (the starting inoculum size is indicated

Wild-type P. aeruginosa was the
least susceptible strain among the tested Gram-negative bacteria.
All biocides, except 5a, were effective against this
strain in PBS and reached total kill within 5 min of contact (Figure 5). However, only 6a (in 20 min), BC (30 min) and 5b (60 minutes) reached total kill of
PA01 in HPM, and all other biocides failed to reach total kill in
HPM in the tested time frame (60 min). 6a clearly stands
out as the most potent biocide among all of the tested ones in both
PBS and HPM when being challenged with the least susceptible bacterium.

± SD. n = 3 for all of the compounds and results
are significantly different (p < 0.05) (the starting

MRSA, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and wild-type P. aeruginosa were also challenged by sodium hypochlorite
in PBS at 141.0 and
282.1 μM (equivalent to 5 and 10 ppm [Cl+]) and in
HPM at 423.1 and 864.3 μM (equivalent to 15 and 30 ppm [Cl+]) for 10, 20, 30, and 60 min. The initial bacterial concentrations
for the above bacteria were 4.2 × 106, 4.8 ×
106, 5.4 × 106, and 3.6 × 106 CFU/mL, respectively. No significant bacterial reduction was observed
at the tested concentrations within 1 h of contact of all of the bacteria
(p > 0.05) except for one case: 23% reduction
of
MRSA achieved by 282.1 μM sodium hypochlorite (equivalent to
10 ppm [Cl+]) in PBS within 60 min of contact (p = 0.027 < 0.05).

Discussion
Antimicrobial
efficacy of multiple QACs compounds was tested against
different bacteria in PBS and HPM. It was observed from Table 1 that in PBS, chlorinated compounds
(6a, 6b, and compound 2) performed
better than nonchlorinated ones (5a, 5b,
and compound 1). This indicates that the introduction
of either amide or amine-based N-chloramine boosts
the antibacterial activity of the whole composite biocides. However,
in HPM, the antimicrobial efficacy of all biocides (chlorinated and
nonchlorinated) (except compound 1 against MRSA) deteriorated,
and Tks of all of the tested biocides (except compound 1 against MRSA) increased in comparison to those obtained in PBS.
In the case of QACs, this deterioration in activity might be the result
of ionic and hydrophobic interactions between QAC and negatively charged
peptides and hydrophobic domains on proteins, which resulted in binding
of QAC molecules to proteins and deactivation of QAC.21 On the other hand, N-chloramines could
transfer their active chlorine to proteins through direct contact
or be reduced by sulfur-containing amino acids, such as cysteine and
methionine in HPM.22 The reaction kinetics
of N-chloramine with proteins varies from one compound
to another. Active chlorine loading on the composite biocides was
monitored as a function of time in PBS and HPM (Figure 1). It is confirmed that secondary amine-based
composite biocides (6a and 6b) are more
resistant to protein quench than their amide-based counterpart (compound 2). This correlates well with their superior activity against E. coli in HPM as compared with compound 2 (Table 1). But the
result that Tks of 6a against the other three bacteria
in HPM were significantly shorter (p < 0.05) than
those of both 6b and compound 2 reveals
the existence of other important factors affecting their antibacterial
activity in HPM. The proper balance of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity
in the composite biocide 6a with a C12 alkyl chain might
contribute to more effective membrane damage (mode of action of QACs)
and be one of the other factors. One more possible factor could be
associated with less protein binding of a QAC with a C12 alkyl chain
(6a) via hydrophobic interaction, as reported by Jono
and co-workers.21 They found that C14-benzalkonium
chloride was deactivated more than C12-benzalkonium chloride in the
presence of proteins. This led to less quench of the biocide by proteins
in HPM through the deactivation mechanism of QAC: electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions.

Gilbert and Moore15 have shown that
antibacterial activity of QACs is a function of their structure, alkyl
chain length, and strain of bacteria. For example, to be effective
against Gram-positive bacteria, the alkyl chain of QACs should consist
of 12–14 carbon atoms, however, in the case of Gram-negative
bacteria, the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain should be
between 14 and 16. N-chloramines are more hydrophobic
than their amine/amide precursors, and the added hydrophobicity in N-chloramine/QAC composite biocides might move the optimum
alkyl chain length against Gram-negative bacteria from 14–16
to 12.

In antibacterial test against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and P. aeruginosa, the antibacterial efficacy of 6a and 6b appeared to be less compromised by HPM than compound 2, whereas compound 2 and 6a showed similar
changes in antibacterial kinetics in two media (PBS and HPM) against
MRSA. These results still correlate with the stability of N-chloramine in HPM and can be explained using our hypothesized
mechanism. Proteins in HPM neutralize the amine-based N-chloramine at a slower pace than the amide-based N-chloramine so that the amine-based N-chloramine
is preserved to exert oxidative stress inside a bacterial cell after
the whole molecule diffuses into the cell through the holes in the
bacterial membrane due to the mode of action of the QA moiety. However,
to what degree this advantage of better preserved amine-based N-chloramine can be manifested is also dependent on how
effectively bacterial cells can adsorb the biocides, which is the
first step of QACs’ action of disrupting bacterial membranes. E. coli has a much higher number density of negative
charges (0.145 m–3 at pH 7) than S. aureus (0.025 m–3 at pH 7),23 which might be the reason why this advantage
of better preserved amine-based N-chloramine is not
clearly shown in the challenge test against MRSA in HPM (Figure 2). The thick cell
wall of MRSA might also play a role by delaying the interaction of
the positively charged biocides with bacterial cell membrane. As can
be seen from Figures 2 and 3, BC showed a faster killing
kinetics against E. coli than S. aureus.

5a and 5b were very ineffective against E. coli even in PBS (Figure 3). One possible reason is that the piperidine
functional group is very basic (pKa of
its conjugate acid is around 11)14 and
become protonated in pH 7.4 PBS, greatly increasing the hydrophilicity
of the whole molecules of 5a and 5b. QACs
act on bacterial membranes by inserting their hydrophobic tails into
the hydrophobic membrane core. The enhanced hydrophilicity due to
the protonated piperidine functional group might impede this interaction,
hence compromising the antibacterial potencies of both 5a and 5b. Chlorination of the synthesized QACs boosts
their antibacterial activity via two different mechanisms. First,
chlorine changes the hydrophilicity of QAC compounds by transforming
the positively charged piperidine functional group in biological pH
(7.4) to a neutral moiety (decreased basicity due to the presence
of chlorine). Therefore, the hydrophilicity of the compounds drops,
allowing QACs to better interdigitate into the bacterial membrane
and negatively impact on its osmoregulatory and physiological functions.24 Secondly, active chlorine also attacks targets
in bacterial cells. As reflected from the antibacterial results of
sodium hypochlorite, active chlorine [Cl+] alone at the
tested concentrations within the tested time frame (1 h) in either
PBS or HPM is not effective in killing those bacteria. This indicates
again that the N-chloramine moiety together with
the QA moiety attacks bacterial cells in a potentially synergistic
manner.

Conclusions
Nowadays, prevention of bacterial contaminations
in food industries
has become difficult due to long food production line, large production
volume of food, and antimicrobial resistance.25 Also, the number of effective antimicrobial agents with a good performance
in high protein containing environment is limited.26 In this study, two amine-based N-chloramine/QAC
composite biocides were synthesized. These synthesized biocides were
challenged with various bacterial strains, including Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria MRSA, E. coli, MDR P. aeruginosa, and wild-type P. aeruginosa (PA01) in both PBS and HPM. The results
indicate that when a secondary amine as opposed of an amide-based N-chloramine is used, the loss of active chlorine in high
protein-loaded fluids decreases, which results in less deterioration
of antibacterial activity. The composite biocide 6a demonstrated
the best antibacterial efficacy in both PBS and HPM among all biocides
studied in this study. The relatively better antimicrobial activity
of the amine-based N-chloramine (6a)
in HPM is due to the relatively high stability of the active chlorine
as compared to the amide-based N-chloramine. Transchlorination
between the amine-based N-chloramines (6a, 6b) and proteins in the medium occurs at a slow rate
as compared to the amide-based N-chloramine (compound 2). The amine-based N-chloramine then has
a better chance to exert oxidative stress inside a bacterial cell
after the whole molecule finds its way into the cell due to the membrane
disruption action of the QA moiety. Interestingly, the amine-based
composite biocide with a QAC unit of C12 alkyl chain (6a) is more potent in the protein medium than its counterpart with
a QAC unit of C14 alkyl chain (6b). This is opposite
to the general order of antibacterial activity of QACs with different
alkyl chain lengths: C14 > C12 previously reported18,27 due to the presence of the piperidine-based N-chloramine
moiety in the composite biocide. These interesting findings bring
us one step closer to the design and synthesis of more potentially
non-resistance-inducing biocides potent in real world where organic
matters might be inevitable.

Copper Analysis
Antibacterial effect of copper has
been reported in many studies.28 Copper
has been used as the catalyst for click reaction, and this copper
can interfere the antibacterial activity of compounds. Therefore,
copper removal to the noneffective concentration was crucial. To this
end, Sorbtech CR20-01 beads have been used. Copper concentration in
compounds was measured using ICP optical emission spectrometer, Varian
725-ES.

Redox Titration
Redox titration is a titration technique
in which a redox reaction takes place between an analyte and a titrant.19 A redox indicator and conductometer were used
during the titration. In this study, redox titration was carried on,
to track the chlorine lost in high protein-loaded fluid (5% FBS) for 6a, 6b, and compound 2.

To
this end, 0.25 mmol of each compound dissolved in 10 mL of Milli-Q
water to have an aqueous solution of each compound. Afterward, 50
μL of fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to 950 μL of
the prepared solution and mix them on an orbital shaker for different
time frames (1, 5, 20, 60, 90, and 120 min). Mixture (100 μL)
was added to a mixture of 30 mL of Milli-Q water, 2 mL of 5% acetic
acid buffer solution, 1 g (6 mmol) potassium iodide, and five drops
of freshly prepared 1% starch solution to get a solution with a dark
purple color. Sodium thiosulfate standard solution (0.001 N) was used
to titrate (dropwise addition) the mixture using buret. The titration
stopped when the solution color turned clear, and the chlorine content
was calculated as below  where Mw, m, and Vt stand for molecular
weight (g/mol), mass of the compound (g), and buret reading (mL),
respectively.

Quantitative Antimicrobial Assay (in PBS
and High Protein Medium)
A bacterial suspension was prepared
at a concentration of 108 CFU/mL in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4)
using 0.5 McFarland standard. After 100 times dilution, 20 μL
of diluted suspension was added to 60 mL of different broths based
on the bacterial strains, Tryptone Soy Broth in the case of MRSA and
Mueller Hinton Broth for P. aeruginosa and E. coli, followed by 18 h incubation
at 37 °C. After incubation, 50 μL of bacterial suspension
was added to a solution of 5 [Cl]+ ppm (141.0 μM)
to 20 mL of PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) and 15 [Cl]+ ppm (423.1
μM) to a solution of 5% FBS in PBS and incubated on the orbital
mixer at 37 °C. At each time point (1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 min),
150 μL of mixture was added to 150 μL of neutralizer solution
(PBS buffer consisting of 1.4% (w/v) l-α-phosphoatidylcholine,
10% (w/v) Tween 80, 1% peptone, and 0.316% sodium thiosulfate) to
deactivate antimicrobial agent. Bacterial suspension (30 μL)
and its serial dilutions were plated on Tryptone Soya Agar plates
and incubated for 24 h, followed by colony counting. To eliminate
the effect of bacterial growth in HPM and/or bacterial death due to
malnutrition in PBS at each time point, there was a negative control.
The bacterial log reduction was calculated as following  Lecithin, tween, and peptone
have been proven
to be effective in quenching QACs.11,29,30 We have also run adequate inactivation tests to confirm
thorough quenching of our biocides at the tested concentrations (141.0
and 423.1 μM). Specially, we plated bacterial suspensions of
one series of antibacterial experiments 30 and 90 min after mixing
with the neutralizer, and no further decrease of bacterial concentration
was observed from the enumeration results, indicating thorough quench
of all biocides.

To compare the antibacterial efficacy of the
synthesized biocides with free chlorine, an antibacterial test was
also conducted against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and wild-type P. aeruginosa using sodium hypochlorite at two different concentrations (5 and
10 ppm [Cl+] (141.0 and 282.1 μM)) in PBS and two
concentrations (15 and 30 ppm [Cl+] (423.1 and 864.3 μM))
in HPM.
