This
work reports the synthesis of nanosilica-coated magnetic carbonaceous
adsorbents (MCA@SiO2) using low-temperature hydrothermal
carbonization technique (HCT) and the feasibility to utilize it for
methylene blue (MB) adsorption. Initially, a carbon
precursor (CP) was synthesized from corn starch under saline conditions
at 453 K via HCT followed by the magnetization of CP again via HCT
at 453 K. Subsequently, MCA was coated with silica nanoparticles.
MCA and MCA@SiO2 were characterized using X-ray diffraction,
Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive
spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. The BET
surface area of MCA and MCA@SiO2 were found to be 118 and
276 m2 g–1, respectively. Adsorption
of MB onto MCA@SiO2 was performed using batch adsorption
studies and in the optimum condition, MCA@SiO2 showed 99%
adsorption efficiency with 0.5 g L–1 of MCA@SiO2 at pH 7. Adsorption isotherm studies predicted that MB adsorption
onto MCA@SiO2 was homogeneous monolayer adsorption, which
was best described using a Langmuir model with the maximum adsorption
capacity of 516.9 mg g–1 at 25 °C. During adsorption
kinetics, a rapid dye removal was observed which followed pseudo-first-
as well as pseudo-second-order models, which suggested that MB dye
molecules were adsorbed onto MCA@SiO2 via both ion exchange
as well as the chemisorption process. The endothermic and spontaneous
nature of the adsorption of MB onto MCA@SiO2 was established
by thermodynamics studies. Mechanism of dye diffusion was collectively
governed by intraparticle diffusion and film diffusion processes.
Furthermore, MB was also selectively adsorbed from its mixture with
an anionic dye, that is, methyl orange. Column adsorption studies
showed that approximately 500 mL of MB having 50 mg L–1 concentration can be treated with 0.5 g L–1 of
MCA@SiO2. Furthermore, MCA@SiO2 was repeatedly
used for 20 cycles of adsorption–desorption of MB. Therefore,
MCA@SiO2 can be effectively utilized in cationic dye-contaminated
wastewater remediation applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Textile industry being
the main consumer of
synthetic dyes, among several other industries like leather, paper,
food, rubber, and pharmaceuticals, discharges approximately 1000 tons
of dyes annually into different water bodies.1,2 Dye
waste from these industries not only increases the content of suspended
solids, biological and chemical oxygen demands, and toxicity of wastewater
but also makes water aesthetically unpleasant.3 This also interferes with the penetration of light, hence affecting
aquatic photosynthesis.4 Methylene blue
(MB) dye is a cationic thiazine dye having uses in different industries,
especially in the textile and dyeing industries.5 MB dye is also used in many pharmaceutical applications.6 The chemical structure of MB is shown under Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information. Short-term
exposure to MB is known to cause eye and skin irritation, whereas
prolonged exposure can result in nausea, breathing difficulty, increased
heart rate, gastritis, and mental confusion.5,7 Thus,
the complete removal of MB from the industrial waste prior to their
discharge is very important.

Various techniques have been employed
to remove dye contaminants from industrial wastewater. Among them,
the most popularly discussed methods include degradation either photocatalytic
or sonochemical, adsorption, membrane filtration, biosorption, Fenton-biological
treatment, oxidation, and coagulation–flocculation.8−10 The most advantageous method
is found to be adsorption, which is an equilibrium separation technique.
Its low cost, ease and flexibility of design, reduced sensitivity
to toxic contaminants makes adsorption the best technique for dye
removal as compared to other techniques.11−13 Adsorption
using economical adsorbents for
efficient decolorization has been studied in recent times.14−16 The high cost of the most commonly
used adsorbent, that is, activated carbon,17 has led to the use of several cheap and nonconventional adsorbents
like sawdust, sugar cane bagasse, rice husk, fruit shells, and different
gum polysaccharide-based hydrogels.1,18−21 However, their low mechanical strength does not allow them to be
used on an industrial scale. In recent years, substantial progress
has been made for using different nanomaterials especially metal oxide
nanoparticles such as ZnO, TiO2, Fe3O4, and SiO2 in different wastewater treatment applications.4,22−24 Therefore,
researchers are focusing on developing nanoadsorbents because of high
porosity and increased surface area for adsorption.25 Nanosilica-based adsorbents have attained special attention
because of low cost and easy synthesis process.26,27 Separation
of these nanoadsorbents after wastewater treatment is very difficult
but the addition of nanomagnets to these adsorbents is found to have
a positive impact on their separation from solution after adsorption.
Nanoadsorbents with a magnetic medium can be easily removed from solutions
using an external magnet.28 However, the
high cost of the synthesis of magnetic nanoadsorbents can be overcome
by using carbon precursors prepared from low-cost biopolymers.29

Biopolymers can be converted to carbonaceous
materials with water as the reaction medium via an ecofriendly thermal
conversion process known as hydrothermal carbonization technique (HCT)
under mild conditions and a temperature up to or below 523 K.30 In HCT reactions, wet biopolymers can be processed,
which reduces the extra cost of drying wet biopolymers; also, it has
almost the same conversion efficiency as pyrolysis at comparatively
higher temperatures.31 Low-temperature
HCT is advantageous as it involves one-step synthesis with mild and
environment-friendly conditions.32 However,
in general, biopolymers experience difficulty to undergo conversion
to carbonaceous materials at low temperatures except for particular
biopolymers like corn starch and corncob even at temperatures of approximately
453 K under saline conditions (common salts such as ZnCl2) as the hydrophilic ions present in these salts reduce the partial
pressure of water.22,29,33

Therefore, keeping in view the advantages of the low-temperature
HCT method for the preparation of carbonaceous materials at comparatively
lower temperatures than other existing techniques and the benefits
of using various nanomaterials in water purification applications,
in this research work, we initially synthesized carbonaceous material;
that is, the carbon precursor (CP), from low-cost starch using low-temperature
HCT at 453 K under saline conditions CP was further magnetized to
produce an MCA (magnetic carbonaceous adsorbent) again via low-temperature
HCT. Subsequently, MCA was successfully coated with nanosilica by
treatment with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and ethanol. The adsorption
efficiency of MCA@SiO2 for effectively decolorizing MB
in aqueous solution was tested and also its chemical, physical, and
structural characteristics were investigated. Different adsorption
parameters were optimized, and adsorption kinetics and isotherm experiments
conducted to best understand the adsorption mechanism of MCA@SiO2. Additionally, its applicability for industrial applications
was examined for 20 successive cycles of adsorption–desorption.
The dynamic and selective adsorption of cationic dye, that is, MB,
was also tested using column studies and from its mixture with methyl
orange (MO) (an anionic dye). The innovative approach of this work
is the use of low-temperature HCT technique for the preparation of
magnetic carbonaceous material and further their coating with nanosilica
and subsequently their use in water purification applications as an
adsorbent.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials and
Methods
FeCl3·6H2O (reagent grade,
purity ≥97%), ZnCl2 (ACS reagent, purity ≥97%),
corn starch, MB (dye content, ≥82%), MO (ACS reagent, dye content
85%), acetone (HPLC grade, purity ≥99.9%), TEOS (GC grade,
purity ≥99%), ammonium hydroxide (ACS reagent), ethanol (purity
≥97%) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, UAE.

2.2 Adsorbent Synthesis
2.2.1 CP and MCA Synthesis
CP as well as MCA were synthesized using corn starch as the starting
material via low-temperature HCT. The detailed procedure for the synthesis
of CP from corn starch and its magnetization using FeCl3·6H2O is reported in our previous publication.22 Briefly, 6.0 g of corn starch and 9.0 g of ZnCl2 were mixed thoroughly with 30 mL of deionized water in a
Teflon container using a magnetic stirrer. The Teflon container was
kept in an autoclave, tightly closed, and heated at a temperature
of 453 K for 6 h. The solid residue was collected by vacuum filtration
and excess ZnCl2 was removed by excessive washings with
deionized water. In the next step, CP (4 g) synthesized in the first
step was mixed and stirred with FeCl3·6H2O (2 g) in 50 mL of deionized water for 30 min. During stirring,
25 mL of NaOH (2.5 N) was added dropwise. Thereafter, the reaction
mixture was heated in a tightly sealed Teflon container at 453 K for
6 h. Finally, the prepared MCA was dried in a vacuum oven after repeatedly
washing with deionized water.

2.2.2 Synthesis
of MCA@SiO2
In the second step,
silica nanoparticles were coated on MCA via the Stöber method
using TEOS as the silica source and ammonia as a catalyst in homogeneous
aqueous-alcoholic medium. Initially, MCA particles (0.3 g) were dispersed
in an ethanol (42 mL) and water (4.5 mL) mixture with constant stirring
for 10 min followed by the addition of a silica source, that is, TEOS
(2.5 mL), to the suspension. Subsequently, aqueous ammonia solution
(2 M, 7.5 mL) was added dropwise under constant stirring to hydrolyze
the silica precursor. Hydrolysis reaction was continued at room temperature
for 24 h under stirring condition. Then, MCA@SiO2 was collected
via centrifugation and given successive washings with ethanol/water
mixture. Finally, MCA@SiO2 was dried in an oven at 80 °C
for 24 h. The detailed process for MCA@SiO2 synthesis is
presented in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Detailed Procedure
for MCA@SiO2 Synthesis by Taking Corn Starch as the Starting
Material
2.3 Characterization
The KBr pellet method
was utilized to record the Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra using a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrophotometer.
An X’PERT Powder PANalytical powder diffractometer (The Netherlands)
was used to obtain the (XRD) X-ray diffraction patterns. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) analysis using a Quanta FEG 250 scanning
electron microscope, FEI (USA), was done to capture SEM images of
the carbon-coated dried samples for examining the surface morphology.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs were obtained using
FEI, Tecnai T20, The Netherlands , transmission electron microscopy
with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (TEM–EDX). Surface properties
of MCA@SiO2 were evaluated via N2 adsorption–desorption
using Micromeritics ASAP 2020. For calculating pzc, that is, point
of zero charge, 0.05 g of MCA@SiO2 was added in aqueous
solution having pH in the range of 2–11 and agitated till constant
pH was obtained. A graph between the starting pH and the difference
between the starting and final pH was plotted to calculate the pzc.4 The concentration of free hydroxyl (−OH)
and carboxylic acid (−COOH) groups in MCA and after the coating
with silica nanoparticles were determined through Boehm titration.34 For these experiments, a fixed amount of both
the materials, that is, MCA and MCA@SiO2, were suspended
in 0.1 N solutions of NaOH and NaHCO3 in separate containers.
Thereafter, the supernatant of both the solutions (5 mL) were back-titrated
using 0.1 N HCl and the concentration of free −OH and −COOH
groups present in MCA and MCA@SiO2 were calculated based
on residual bases after back-titration.

2.4 MB Adsorption
To study the adsorption
performance of MCA@SiO2 for MB dye removal, adsorption
experiments were conducted using the batch equilibrium method. MB
dye solutions (50 mL, 100 mg.L–1, Co) and varied quantities of adsorbent were agitated at
400 rpm in glass bottles for 24 h. Subsequently, the solutions were
filtered and the residual dye concentration (Ce) was analyzed at λmax of MB (668 nm) using
UV–vis spectrophotometry (Varian Cary 5000, USA). Adsorption
efficiency was calculated using eq 1 1  

Isotherm experiments were conducted
with dye solutions of 50–500
mg L–1 concentration, whereas kinetics experiments
were performed with 50, 100, and 150 mg L–1 concentration
solutions of MB. Equilibrium adsorption capacity (qe) was calculated as 2  where V and m denote the solution volume and adsorbent
mass, respectively.

The dynamic adsorption behavior of MCA@SiO2 was also studied to examine its ability for the treatment
of industrial dye waste stuff and to act as a column filler. For these
experiments, 0.5 g L–1 MCA@SiO2 was filled
in a syringe to form a filter bed and MB dye solution (50 mg L–1) was passed through it, effluent was collected, and
analyzed using a UV–vis spectrophotometer.

Desorption
of already adsorbed dye molecules and regeneration of adsorption sites
of the adsorbent for adsorbing dye molecules again were performed
successfully for 20 consecutive sets of adsorption–desorption.
Acetone was used for desorption of MB dye molecules as well as for
regenerating the adsorption sites of MCA@SiO2. Before using
the adsorbent particles for the next cycle of adsorption–desorption,
adsorbent particles were dried at 60 °C after washing with deionized
water.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Characterization
To understand the successful synthesis of MCA via HCT and coating
of nanosilica on its surface, the FT-IR of MCA, SiO2, and
MCA@SiO2 were studied as shown in Figure 1a. In the case of MCA, the FT-IR spectrum
depicted peaks of the C–O bond (1247 and 1056 cm–1), C=C and C–H stretching related to the aromatic group
(1576 and 2943 cm–1, respectively), −OH group
stretching (3357 cm–1), and the peak representing
the presence of magnetic Fe3O4 particles deposited
on the sample surface (590 cm–1).22,35 However,
the FT-IR spectrum of SiO2 showed peaks of the surface
−OH group at 1630 and 2800–3700 cm–1, respectively, whereas the silicon dioxide structure was shown by
the presence of characteristic peaks at 952 (Si–OH stretching),
792 (Si–O bending), and 1050 cm–1(Si–O–Si
stretching).36 Nanosilica was successfully
coated onto the MCA surface, which was shown by the characteristic
peaks obtained in the FTIR spectrum of MCA@SiO2 at 1630,
3357, 1057, 966, and 784 cm–1.37 However, a peak at 590 cm–1 represented
the presence of magnetic Fe3O4 particles.38

and MCA@SiO2, (c) N2 adsorption–desorption

XRD patterns of MCA, SiO2,
and MCA@SiO2 are shown in Figure 1b. Characteristic XRD peaks of MCA observed
at 2θ = 30.01, 31.7, 35.4, 43.01, 45.42, 56.93, and 62.47°
indicated the formation of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles
on the CP surface.22,29 In the XRD spectrum of SiO2 nanoparticles, a broad peak at 22.83° reflected its
amorphous nature.37 The presence of the
peak at 2θ = 22.32° in the XRD pattern of MCA@SiO2 confirmed the successful coating of nanosilica on MCA.37 Intensities of MCA peaks in the XRD spectrum
of MCA@SiO2 were relatively lower than pure MCA, which
could be because of the coating of amorphous SiO2 on its
surface.

N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm
of CP, MCA, and MCA@SiO2 are presented in Figure 1c,d and different surface parameters
are compiled in Table S1, Supporting Information. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore
volume of CP improved significantly after the incorporation of Fe3O4 MNPs, which further improved after coating with
nanosilica. Therefore, MCA@SiO2 displayed a higher surface
area and pore volume than MCA and CP (Table S1, Supporting Information). According to Figure 1c, both MCA and MCA@SiO2 showed
a type IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop. However, the hysteresis
loop of MCA@SiO2 is more profound and distinct compared
to MCA. The hysteresis loop of MCA@SiO2 can be classified
as H2 type, indicating the existence of mesopores that
probably arise from carbon, iron, and silica interparticle vacancies.
The pore size distribution of the MCA@SiO2 sample exhibited
pores ranging from 2 to 25 nm with an average pore size centered at
10.8 nm (Figure 1d).
Overall, the assembling of carbon and iron-silica nanoparticles clearly
showed enhancement in the surface area and porosity improvement in
MCA@SiO2.

Free −OH and −COOH groups’
concentrations in MCA and MCA@SiO2 were determined using
Boehm titration and in MCA the concentration of free −OH and
−COOH groups was found to be 0.045 and 0.012 mequiv g–1, respectively. After coating with silica nanoparticles, the concentration
of −OH groups increased to 0.062 mequiv g–1, whereas the concentration of −COOH increased from to a value
of 0.015 mequiv g–1.

SEM images of MCA before
and after coating with nanosilica were investigated as shown in Figure 2a–c. The presence
of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles and carbon spheres
were observed in the SEM image of MCA and before nanosilica coating,
the MCA surface appeared to be smooth and homogeneous (Figure 2a). Figure 2b,c shows monodispersed clusters of nanosilica
on the MCA surface. Furthermore, the MCA@SiO2 surface was
heterogeneous in nature and trapped by SiO2 particles,
thereby confirming the successful coating of nanosilica onto the MCA
surface. The average particle seize of the composite materials, that
is, MCA@SiO2, was found to be 9.20 μm. Figure 2d shows elemental mapping of
MCA@SiO2 and the presence of different elements such as
silicon, oxygen, carbon, and iron onto the MCA@SiO2 surface
also confirmed the coating of MCA with nanosilica.

(e) MCA; (f,g) MCA@SiO2 at different magnifications, and
(h) energy-dispersive system spectrum of MCA@SiO2.

TEM images
of MCA and MCA@SiO2 are represented in Figure 2e–g. The TEM image of
MCA (Figure 2e) clearly
revealed the deposition of magnetic nanoparticles on the CP surface,
which have spheres like morphology.22 Furthermore,
TEM images of MCA@SiO2 also showed that the MCA surface
was covered by silica nanoparticles, which predicted the successful
coating of nanosilica onto the MCA surface (Figure 2f,g), which was further supported by the
Si peak present in the EDX pattern of MCA@SiO2 (Figure 2h).

3.2 Adsorption of MB by MCA@SiO2
Figure 3a shows the influence of MB
concentration on MCA@SiO2 performance, which was studied
by varying the MB concentration (50–500
mg L–1). Adsorption efficiency decreased progressively
with increasing MB concentration. The higher adsorption efficiency
at comparatively lesser MB concentration was because of the lower
ratio of adsorption sites of adsorbent to the number of dye molecules
to be adsorbed; on the other side, the lower adsorption efficiency
at a comparatively higher initial dye concentration was because of
the less availability of adsorption sites.39

solution pH = 7 and adsorbent dose = 0.5 mg L–1;
(b) MCA@SiO2 dosage with MB concentration = 100 mg L–1, dye solution volume = 50 mL and (c) solution pH

of different cations on adsorption efficiency with MB concentration
= 100 mg L–1, dye solution volume = 50 mL and adsorbent
dose = 0.5 g L–1.

3.2.1 Effect of MCA@SiO2 Dose
For
practical applicability of MCA@SiO2, it becomes very important
to adsorb a higher amount of target
pollutant at a comparatively lower dose. Therefore, the effect of
MCA@SiO2 mass on its adsorption performance was examined
with varied adsorbent dose (0.1–0.7 g L–1) for MB adsorption. The results reported in Figure 3b clearly demonstrate that the adsorption
efficiency for MB dye removal increased gradually with increased dose
of MCA@SiO2 and almost 80% dye was removed from bulk solution
with 0.5 g L–1 of MCA@SiO2. This increment
in the adsorption efficiency was assigned to the combined effect of
a larger surface area along with a higher concentration of adsorption
sites for dye molecules’ attachment.18,40,41 However, after attaining equilibrium adsorption,
further increase in MCA@SiO2 mass did not alter the adsorption
efficiency, which could be ascribed to the agglomeration of MCA@SiO2 particles at high concentrations which blocked some adsorption
sites, reducing the total available adsorption surface area.18,41

3.2.2 Effect of
Solution pH
MCA@SiO2 performance in the dye solutions
having varied pH was examined by altering solution pH from 2 (strongly
acidic) to 11 (strongly basic) Figure 3c. The performance of MCA@SiO2 for MB removal
or the adsorption efficiency was shown to be extremely low in highly
acidic pH conditions, that is, in the dye solutions having pH 2–4.
As the pH increased to 6, the adsorption efficiency increased to 90%
and achieved the equilibrium value of 99% at pH 7. This poor performance
of MCA@SiO2 in the highly acidic dye solutions was due
to the strong interference of free H+ ions, present in
a high concentration in the strong acidic solutions with the adsorption
of cationic dye molecules.4,22,40 These H+ ions reduced the number of available adsorption
sites of MCA@SiO2 for the attachment of dye molecules,
which ultimately affected the adsorption efficiency or the performance
of MCA@SiO2. But with changing pH of dye solution from
strong acidic to weak acidic and moving toward alkaline pH, the concentration
of H+ ions keeps on decreasing, which reduced competition
among cationic dye molecules and H+ ions and subsequently
increased available adsorption sites for dye adsorption and ultimately
increased the adsorption efficiency. Moreover, while changing solution
pH towards alkaline, protonated groups started becoming deprotonated,
which also increased the chances of the presence of electrostatic
interactions between MCA@SiO2 and MB.4,40 Equilibrium
adsorption efficiency was observed in neutral pH dye solution; however,
further increasing the solution toward strongly alkaline did not change
the adsorption efficiency and it remained almost constant. Adsorption
efficiency of any adsorbent also depends upon its pzc and for cationic
adsorbates higher adsorption is observed in solutions where pH >
pzc; however, for anionic adsorbates, it is reverse, that is, adsorption
is higher if solution pH < pzc.18 Here,@@@
in this case pzc of MCA@SiO2 was found to be 4.41 (Figure 3d), therefore, the
adsorption efficiency increased with increasing solution pH above
pzc value. For further adsorption experiments, solution pH was kept
neutral because approximately 99% dye adsorption was observed at this
pH.

3.2.3 Interference
of other Metal Cations of the Performance of MCA@SiO2
Further, to understand the adsorption mechanism of MB on MCA@SiO2 adsorption sites, the interaction between MB molecules and
binding sites of adsorbent were studied. MB solutions with different
metal cation strengths of NaCl and CaCl2 were used. As
the metal cation strength increased in the respective solution, adsorption
efficiency showed a gradual decrease (Figure 3e). Also, the performance of adsorbent for
the dye removal reduced to a higher extent in the solution having
Ca2+ ions (Figure 3e). These finding strongly support the possibilities of the
presence of electrostatic interactions between MCA@SiO2 and MB.40

3.2.4 Adsorption
Kinetics
The adsorption
time for removing pollutant is very critical especially in case of
dyes or heavy metal ions removal, therefore, adsorption kinetics were
conducted using MB solutions of 50, 100, and 150 mg L–1. A rapid adsorption of dye was observed for all the three concentrations
studied and the dye solutions became colorless very fast, 50 mg L–1 solution, became colorless within 3.5 min, whereas,
100 mg L–1 solution became colorless within 5 min
and in 150 mg L–1 solution became colorless within
7 min (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). This very fast and rapid dye adsorption was because of large concentration
easy availability of adsorption sites.

Furthermore, in starting,
the rate of adsorption was higher which progressively decreased while
moving towards the equilibrium. High adsorption rate in the starting
was because of easy availability of binding sites of MCA@SiO2, whereas, the slow and gradual decrease in the adsorption rate with
time was due to attaining saturation during the final steps of adsorption.4 Moreover, equilibrium adsorption reached much
faster in the dye solutions of lower concentration because stronger
adsorption driving forces were present in lower concentration solutions
which helped attaining equilibrium.27

To investigate adsorption kinetics and diffusion rate controlling
steps, experimental kinetics data was fitted using Elovich (Figure
S2b, Supporting Information), pseudo-first
and pseudo-second-order models (Figure 4a,b).41,42 Equations of these models and
various parameters related to them are discussed in Table S2, Supporting Information. Most suitably fitted
kinetics model was selected depending on the values of correlation
coefficient (R2), akaike (AIC) and bayesian
information criterion (BIC) (Table 1) which showed that the kinetics of adsorption for
MB removal using MCA@SiO2 followed pseudo-second-order
model (Table 1) predicting
the binding of dye molecules onto MCA@SiO2 adsorption sites
via chemisorption process involving the electrons sharing.43 Value of initial sorption rate (ho) obtained using pseudo-second-order model was also reasonably
higher predicting the presence of surface exchange reactions between
MB dye molecules and MCA@SiO2.44 Furthermore, kinetics data was also satisfactorily fitted to pseudo-first-order
model and showed reasonally higher value of R2 which was close to unity as well as qe,cal values of all the three dye concentrations were in very
much close proximity of qe,exp values
which further predicted applicability of pseudo-first-order model.
Therefore, the kinetics of MB adsorption onto MCA@SiO2 followed
both pseudo-first and pseudo-second-order models. Similar trends for
adsorption kinetics were also observed previously for remazol golden
yellow dye adsorption using orange peel45 and MB using activated carbon.46 Furthermore,
the value of R2 for Elovich model for
all the dye concentrations studied were also quite high (Table S1) suggesting that the dye molecules attached
to MCA@SiO2 particles via both ion exchange as well as
chemisorption.22

Dye transportation
from bulk solution to the internal porous structure of adsorbents
especially in case of hydrogels is a combination of different processes
including: (a) passage of adsorbate from solution to outer phase of
adsorbent surface (b) transportation of adsorbate from boundary layer
to interior adsorbent surface and (c) relocation of adsorbate molecules
to adsorption sites.14 The slowest step
out of the above mentioned steps controls overall diffusion rate of
adsorbate molecules. Therefore, to understand the diffusion mechanism,
adsorption kinetics data was further fitted using intraparticle diffusion
(Figure 4c) and liquid
film diffusion models (Figure 4d).41 The plot of intraparticle
diffusion model had two regions with their individual slopes which
ruled-out the possibility of dye diffusion solely governed by intraparticle
diffusion mechanism. These results also suggested the possible contribution
of film diffusion mechanism but the plot of liquid-film diffusion
model (Figure 4d) also
did not fulfilled both the conditions of not having slope and passing
through origin, therefore, it can be concluded from these studies
that the dye diffusion collectively followed intraparticle as well
as liquid film diffusion mechanisms.23 Similar
dye diffusion mechanism for MB dye was also reported for its adsorption
using hazelnut shell powder.47

3.2.5 Adsorption Isotherm
Applicability of different isotherm
models like Halsey, Jovanovich,
Temkin, Dubinin–Kaganer–Radushkevich (DKR), Freundlich,
and Langmuir models was checked for the experimental data at 25 °C
(Figure 5a), 35 °C
(Figure 5b) and 45
°C (Figure 5c).48,49

Figure 5 Plots
of different
two-parameter adsorption isotherm models at (a) 25; (b) 35 and (c)
45 °C where MB concentration = 50–500 mg L–1, adsorbent dose = 0.5 g L–1, solution pH = 7.0
and (d) vant’s Hoff plot for the determination of different
thermodynamics parameters for the adsorption of MB onto MCA@SiO2.

Values of different isotherm parameters
are tabulated in Table 2, however, the equations
of these models are compiled in Table S4, Supporting Information. Experimental data agreed well with Langmuir monolayer
model and exhibited maximum adsorption capacities of 516.9 (25 °C),
544.3 (35 °C) and 556.9 mg g–1 (45 °C)
(Table 2). Applicability
of Langmuir model predicted that the single layer of adsorbate (dye
molecules) uniformly covered MCA@SiO2 surface which have
identical adsorption sites to attach dye molecules.41 Moreover, the value of RL (between
0 and 1 for all three temperatures) further strengthened the Langmuir
model applicability (Table 2). In Temkin isotherm, increased value of β also suggested
the existence of evenly distributed binding energies sites on MCA@SiO2 surface.41 In Freundlich adsorption
isotherm, 1/n values were less than 1.0, which suggested
that the MCA@SiO2 was applicable over complete range of
MB dye concentration studied.23,41

Experimental isotherm
data was further fitted to three-parameter isotherm models namely
Redlich–Peterson, Radke–Prausnitz, BET, Koble–Corrigen,
Hill, Toth, Sips, Brouers–Sotolongo and Vieth–Sladek
models.48,49 Mathematical expressions of these models
are given in Table S4, Supporting Information. Plots of all these models at different temperatures are represented
in Figure S3, Supporting Information and
various parameters obtained are tabulated in Table S5, Supporting Information. On comparing the values
of different isotherm parameters obtained it was observed that the
dye adsorption on MCA@SiO2 followed Toth, Radke–Prausnitz
and Redlich–Peterson models among all three-parameter isotherm
models studied which further supported possibility of homogeneous
monolayer adsorption and applicability of Langmuir model.

3.2.6 Adsorption Thermodynamics
Study of the thermodynamics
for an adsorption process is very important
to find out either adsorption occurs spontaneously or not. Different
thermodynamics parameters were calculated using the following equations 3   4   5  where, KL represents distribution
coefficient; ΔS° denotes standard entropy
change, ΔH° denotes standard enthalpy
and ΔG° denotes standard free energy change.
Plot of ln KL versus 1/T was plotted (Figure 5d) to calculate values of ΔH° and ΔS°. Value of different thermodynamic parameters were
tabulated in Table 3. Negative and decreasing value of ΔG°
with increasing temperature predicted spontaneity of MB adsorption
onto MCA@SiO2 which was more favorable at comparatively
lower temperatures and have high affinity of adsorbate on adsorbent
surface.50 Furthermore, positive value
of ΔH° also suggested endothermic nature
of adsorption. Nature of adsorption process that is chemisorption
or physical adsorption also depends upon value of ΔH°. For chemisorption it should be 20.9–418.4 kJ mol–1 but for physical adsorption it should be 2.1–20.9
kJ mol–1.51 In this case,
the value of ΔH° is 51.81 kJ mol–1, therefore, MB was adsorbed onto MCA@SiO2 through chemisorption
process, which was also predicted by adsorption kinetics. Moreover,
positive value of ΔS° indicated increased
entropy and disorders at solid–liquid interface (Table 3).

Adsorption capacity
of MCA@SiO2 was compared with other adsorbents which are
already reported (Table 4). MCA@SiO2 showed good adsorption capacity as compared
to these adsorbents suggesting very good chances of its future applicability
in large scale industrial applications.

The ability of MCA@SiO2 for decolorization of MB dye
via adsorption process was also
compared with some other processes like enzymatic treatment, coagulation
coupled adsorption and combined chemical coagulation, electrocoagulation,
and adsorption processes (Table 5) for the decolorization of different dyes. It was
observed that the MB dye decolorization ability of MCA@SiO2 via adsorption process was quite good and gave good results when
compared with other methods of dyes decolorization.

3.2.7 Selective Adsorption
of MB
Selective adsorption of
MB onto MCA@SiO2 particles were
also examined by studying the adsorption behaviour of MCA@SiO2 for a mixture of cationic that is MB and anionic that is
MO dye in different concentration ratios (Figure 6). It was observed that the color of mixed
dye solution became green for both the mixtures that is 1:1 ratio
of MB and MO (Figure 6a) and 5:1 ratio of MB and MO (Figure 6b) but after adsorption color of both the solutions
again changed back to orange which was the original color of MO dye
solution. Furthermore, UV–vis spectra of dye mixture solutions
before adsorption showed peaks of both the individual dyes that is
MB (660 nm) and MO (464 nm) whereas, after adsorption peak of MB disappeared
but the peak of MO was still present at the same position having almost
the same intensity. Therefore, from these findings it can be concluded
that MCA@SiO2 have ability to adsorb cationic dyes selectively
from a mixture of different dye solutions.65

Figure 6 Plots
of the selective adsorption of MB onto
MCA@SiO2 from the mixture of MB and MO dyes having concentrations
(a) MB/MO = 1:1 and (b) MB/MO = 5:1.

3.2.8 Column Tests
The dynamic adsorption
performance of MCA@SiO2 to adsorb
MB was also tested using the column studies. MB solution of 50 mg
L–1 concentration became almost colorless after
passing through the column (Figure 7). Figure 7a shows the images of column packed with MCA@SiO2 before, during and after the filtration of MB. Almost 430 mL dye
solution of 50 mg L–1 concentration became colorless
and its concentration became zero, thereafter, the concentration of
effluent passed through the column started increasing slowly and after
passing 500 mL dye solution from column the concentration of MB filtered
became 1.9 mg L–1 (Figure 7b). Furthermore, the adsorption efficiency
of column increased continuously as the volume of MB increased which
is clearly seen in the Figure 7c. This increased adsorption efficiency with continuously
increasing effluent was attributed to the high adsorption capacity
of MCA@SiO2 along with the fast adsorption rate.65 The process of filtration of MB through column
packed with MCA@SiO2 is shown in Video S1, Supporting Information. Figure 7d also shows relationship between the concentration
of MB effluent after filtration and volume of effluent passed or filtered
through column packed with MCA@SiO2. In the figure red
line shows the initial concentration that is Co of MB passed through the column and it was observed that
even after passing 500 mL of MB the concentration of effluent after
filtration was as low as 1.9 mg L–1, therefore,
from these studies it can be predicted that MCA@SiO2 have
potential to treat larger quantities of MB contaminated wastewater
in industrial applications.

of column
of MCA@SiO2 for the adsorption of MB before, during and
after adsorption where MB concentration = 50 mg L–1; (b) UV–vis spectra of every 10 mL (up to 500 mL) of MB before
the filtration through the column packed with MCA@SiO2;
(c) plot of the adsorption efficiency of MCA@SiO2 vs dye
effluent volume and (d) relationship between volume of dye treated
and concentration of dye after filtration through column.

Furthermore, different concentration
solutions MB (50, 100, and 150 mg L–1) were also
passed through the column by applying an external force (see Video
S2, Supporting Information). For these
experiments, initially, 10 mL solutions of each 50, 100, and 150 mg
L–1 were quickly passed through column under the
influence of an external force, respectively (Figure 8). 10 mL of each MB solution became colorless
and their absorbance reduced nearly to zero which conforms the dynamic
adsorption behavior of MCA@SiO2.

plot of MB (10 mg L–1) before filtration and 50,
100 and 150 mg L–1 after filtration through syringe
column under pressure.

3.2.9 Regeneration
Studies
For the practical
utility of any adsorbent, its multiple time use is very crucial. Therefore,
the reusability experiments for the multiple time adsorption of MB
using MCA@SiO2 were performed for consecutive 20 cycles
of adsorption–desorption. Initially, MB dye was adsorbed onto
MCA@SiO2 particles then dye loaded adsorbent particles
were separated and dried in hot air over. Thereafter, these particles
were added in 50 mL acetone and agitated at 120 rpm for 60 min followed
by the separation. Adsorbent particles were washed repeatedly using
deionized water, dried and again used for adsorption–desorption.
It was observed that the performance of MCA@SiO2 particles
for MB adsorption remained constant that is almost 100% for the first
seventeen cycles, however, in the last three cycles the adsorption
capacity decreased little much which was also very less (Figure S4, Supporting Information), therefore, it can be
used again and again for the treatment of MB contaminated wastewater.

3.2.10 Adsorption Mechanism
Adsorption capacity
or the performance of any adsorbent not solely
depends upon the pore structure and specific surface area but also
influenced by many other factors like the nature of binding sites
of adsorbent, adsorbate–adsorbent interactions, charge of the
adsorbate surface at a particular solution pH. Mostly, adsorbate molecules
attach to adsorbent surface through interactions such as hydrogen
bonding, ion-exchange, dipole–dipole interactions, hydrophobic
interaction, coordination by surface metal cations and electrostatic
interactions.66 In case of dyes adsorption,
dye molecules mostly attach to the adsorbent surface through electrostatic
interactions, here in this case also we believe that MB dye molecules
attached to MCA@SiO2 surface through electrostatic interactions.
H+ ions ionized in the dye solution and MB+ ions
possible attach to (SiO)− ions present on adsorbent
surface using electrostatic interactions.55 In strongly acidic solutions, the adsorption was much less which
kept on increasing while changing pH from strongly acidic to weak
acidic and neutral (Section 3.2.2), which might be due to comparatively higher negatively
charged surface of adsorbent at higher pH solutions. This observation
also supports the electrostatic interactions between MB and MCA@SiO2. On the other hand, performance of MCA@SiO2 was
also good in weakly acidic pH solutions which also predicted the presence
of hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen atom of MB and silanol group
of MCA@SiO2.55,56 Furthermore, the presence
of Na+ and Ca2+ ions also reduced MCA@SiO2 performance for MB removal to a large extent (Section 3.2.3), which
further supported the idea of the presence of electrostatic interactions.
Therefore, these observations predicted that MB dye molecules were
attached to MCA@SiO2 surface via both electrostatic interactions
as well as hydrogen bonding. The possible adsorption mechanism showing
the presence of both electrostatic interactions as well as hydrogen
bonding is shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for the Adsorption
of MB onto MCA@SiO2 and the Presence of Possible Interactions
between MB Dye Molecules
and Binding Sites of MCA@SiO2
Figure S5a, Supporting Information shows
the FTIR of MCA@SiO2 after dye adsorption in which
intensity of some of the peaks reduced while some other peaks were
either shifted to some other positions or completely disappeared as
compared to the FTIR of MCA@SiO2 before adsorption. The
peak representing Si–O–H stretching, initially present
at 966 cm–1 reduced considerably suggested that
H+ ions ionized in dye solution and interactions of MB+ ions and (SiO)− through electrostatic interaction
mechanism.55 Moreover, peak intensities
representing Si–O–Si vibrations at 1057 and 784 cm–1 reduced considerably due to the reduced transmittance
of Si–O–Si bond because dye molecules covered MCA@SiO2 particles.55 These changes in
the FTIR spectrum of MCA@SiO2 suggested that MB molecules
attached to MCA@SiO2 via electrostatic interactions as
well as hydrogel bonding. In the SEM images of MCA@SiO2 after the adsorption of MB dye molecules (Figures S5b,c, Supporting Information), the presence some particles
covering the adsorbent surface was observed which might be possibly
due to the presence of MB dye molecules. Therefore, above studies
concluded that MB molecules attached to MCA@SiO2 via both
electrostatic interactions as well as hydrogen-bonding as shown in Scheme 2.

4 Conclusions
MCA were
successfully synthesized from starch using the low temperature hydrothermal
technique and nanosilica was successfully coated on its surface. Properties
of MCA especially surface properties were significantly improved after
coating with nanosilica. MCA@SiO2 was utilized successfully
as adsorbent for removing MB and the adsorption process followed homogeneous
monolayer Langmuir isotherm with 516.9 mg g–1 adsorption
capacity, whereas, very fast and rapid adsorption of dye was attributed
to the applicability of both pseudo-first and pseudo-second-order
rate equations. Adsorption mechanism mainly involved electrostatic
interactions and hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, diffusion of dye molecules
was collectively governed by intraparticle diffusion and liquid film
diffusion mechanism. MCA@SiO2 particles selectively adsorbed
MB from a mixture of cationic and anionic dyes. Column studies predicted
that MCA@SiO2 can used in large or industrial scale treatment
of MB contaminated wastewater. It was further used for continuous
20 cycles of adsorption–desorption. Therefore, from the aforementioned
studies it can be conclude that MCA@SiO2 have all the properties
to be used as modern adsorbents to effectively treat cationic dyes
contaminated wastewater.
