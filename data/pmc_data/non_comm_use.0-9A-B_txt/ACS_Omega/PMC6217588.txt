Diabetes
diagnosis and management majorly depend upon the measurement
of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Various factors influence HbA1c
levels such as the use of various analytical methods and the presence
of various clinical conditions. Plasma albumin levels were known to
be negatively associated with HbA1c. However, the precise mechanism
by which they affect HbA1c is not well understood. Therefore, we have
studied the influence of albumin levels and its glycation status on
hemoglobin glycation using erythrocyte culture experiments. Erythrocytes
maintained at low albumin concentration exhibited relatively increased
albumin and hemoglobin glycation as compared to that in those maintained
at higher albumin concentration. Increase in albumin glycation may
decrease its ability to protect hemoglobin glycation. This was demonstrated
by treatment of erythrocytes with N(ε)-(carboxymethyl)lysine-modified
serum albumin (CMSA), which failed to protect hemoglobin glycation;
instead, it increased hemoglobin glycation. The inability of CMSA
to reduce hemoglobin glycation was due to the lack of free lysine
residues of albumin, which was corroborated by using N(ε)-(acetyl)lysine serum albumin (AcSA) and clinical diabetic
plasma. This is the first study which demonstrates that the modification
of lysine residues of albumin impairs its ability to inhibit hemoglobin
glycation. Furthermore, correlation studies between HbA1c and albumin
levels or relative albumin fructosamine from clinical subjects supported
our experimental finding that albumin abundance and its glycation
status influence hemoglobin glycation. Therefore, we propose albumin
level and its glycation status to be quantified in conjunction with
HbA1c for better management of diabetes.

Introduction
Poorly controlled diabetes
leads to the development of complications
such as nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular diseases.1 Therefore, good glycemic control is critical
to prevent any such complications.2 Glycemic
status monitored by measuring blood glucose provides an instantaneous
level measure of its level; however, it varies throughout the day
depending upon the diet, work, and antidiabetic medicines.3 Considering the limitations in the measurement
of blood glucose, an International Expert Committee recommended the
measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), as it provides average
glucose level of preceding 120 days, the lifespan of erythrocytes.4,5 This recommendation of HbA1c measurement was subsequently adopted
by the World Health Organization. Furthermore, the usefulness of HbA1c
for prediction of diabetic complications was also established by Diabetes
Control and Complications Trial in type 1 diabetes6 and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study in type 2 diabetes.7 Thus, HbA1c has become a gold standard for the
assessment of chronic glycemic status in clinical practice. However,
quite a few studies also debate the usefulness of HbA1c because of
technical challenges in precise quantification of the N1-deoxyfructosyl
valine-β-Hb substance (HbA1c) by routinely used methods, such
as ion exchange8 and phenylboronate affinity,9 as well as the presence of other clinical conditions
including anemia, blood loss, splenomegaly, and iron deficiency, which
affect HbA1c levels.10

Apart from
these factors, human serum albumin (HSA) has been known
to influence HbA1c; however, it has not gained required attention
perhaps due to its abundance in the plasma, although it has been well
established that low albumin levels were negatively correlated with
HbA1c in a big cohort study comprising 4158 diabetic subjects.11 This association was corroborated in 610 Asian
Indian diabetic subjects.12 Furthermore,
it has been demonstrated in vitro that albumin can protect glycation
of other proteins such as insulin and apomyoglobin by its mere abundance.13 Additionally, low albumin levels were associated
with increased plasma protein glycation including albumin, fibrinogen,
apolipoprotein, heptaglobin, etc., as well as HbA1c in a streptozotocin-induced
diabetic mice model and in clinical subjects.14,15 Moreover, patients with low albumin levels are at higher risk of
development of cardiovascular complications.16 Hence, it was proposed that maintenance of albumin levels in diabetes
would be helpful to prevent the accumulation of advanced glycation
end products and delay the onset of complications.17 Despite the great significance of albumin in diabetes,
it is not routinely quantified in clinical diagnostics. However, glycation
of albumin and plasma proteins is quantified as total plasma fructosamine,
which is used to predict HbA1c. Discordance has been observed between
the predicted HbA1c and observed HbA1c, which is termed as glycation
gap, suggesting that HbA1c does not correlate to the total plasma
fructosamine levels.18 Because albumin
is the most abundant plasma protein, it is plausible that its glycation
status could influence the prediction of HbA1c using the plasma fructosamine
content. Moreover, albumin may act as a principal target for glycation
as compared with hemoglobin because it is freely circulated in plasma
and it has a large number of free lysine and arginine residues accessible
for glucose binding. However, hemoglobin is an intracellular protein
and for its glycation glucose needs to be transported into erythrocytes
through glucose transporter protein 1. Therefore, we hypothesize that
albumin glycation precedes hemoglobin glycation and hence albumin
concentration and its glycation status influences hemoglobin glycation
or HbA1c. To prove this, we have mechanistically demonstrated that
albumin levels and its glycation status indeed influence hemoglobin
glycation in erythrocyte culture. Furthermore, the association among
albumin, plasma fructosamine, and HbA1c was studied in clinical subjects.
The overview of complete study design is depicted in Figure 1.

Results
Establishment
of Erythrocytes as an In Vitro Model for Studying
Glycation
Erythrocytes maintained in normal or relatively
low glucose (LG) (5.2 mM) conditions had HbA1c of 6.1%, whereas it
increased to about 10.6% in erythrocytes maintained in high glucose
(15.7 mM) conditions. Aminoguanidine (AMG), a well-known glycation
inhibitor, reduced HbA1c to 6.8% when compared to that in erythrocytes
maintained at high glucose (Supporting Information Figure S1A). Protein glycation leads to the formation of both
fluorescent and nonfluorescent advanced glycation end products (AGEs).19 Therefore, fluorescent AGEs were quantified
by measuring AGE–hemoglobin fluorescence, and among nonfluorescent
AGEs, carboxymethyl lysine (CML) being the predominant AGE, CML modification
of Hb was monitored by anti-CML antibody Western blotting.20 Both AGE–hemoglobin fluorescence and
CML modification of Hb showed a similar trend as that of HbA1c (Supporting
Information Figure S1A–C).

Unmodified
Albumin Protects Hemoglobin Glycation
Previous
studies have shown that low albumin levels are associated with increased
HbA1c.11,12,14 To find out
the mechanistic insight into this association, erythrocytes were maintained
at varying levels of albumin (15, 20, and 25 mg/mL) in both low and
high glucose condition and hemoglobin glycation was monitored. Albumin
reduced HbA1c in a concentration-dependent manner. A higher level
of albumin (25 mg/mL) reduced HbA1c significantly as compared with
the lower level of albumin (20 or 15 mg/mL) or absence of albumin
in high glucose conditions. However, in low glucose condition, albumin
concentration of only 25 mg/mL reduced HbA1c significantly (Figure 2A). In addition,
albumin reduced advanced glycation of hemoglobin in a concentration-dependent
manner, as measured by AGE-Hb fluorescence, in both low and high glucose
conditions (Figure 2B). This trend was also observed in Western blotting with anti-CML
antibody (Figure 2C).
Furthermore, the effect of albumin on hemoglobin glycation was characterized
and quantified using information-dependent acquisition (IDA) and targeted
SWATH-MS approach, respectively. By using IDA approaches, a total
of 16 glycated peptides of hemoglobin were characterized. SWATH-MS,
a label-free quantitative approach allowed targeted extraction and
quantification of less abundant glycated peptides post acquisition
(Figure 3A,B; Supporting Information Data 1 and File 1). Among 16 glycated peptides, only 4 were
consistently present in all of the mass spectrometric acquisitions
and therefore these peptides were selected for targeted quantification
(Figure 3C). In particular,
VCMHLTPEEK, a carboxymethylated N-terminal valine-containing
peptide of the β subunit of Hb, was found to be the most intense
glycated peptide, as reported earlier.21,22 The area under
the curve (AUC) of these glycated peptides was higher in erythrocytes
grown in high glucose conditions as compared to that of those maintained
in low glucose conditions. Furthermore, in the presence of albumin,
the AUC of these glycated peptides was reduced in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 3C).
All of these data strengthen the fact that the presence of albumin
in erythrocyte culture reduces the glycation of hemoglobin.

to understand the effect of albumin and its glycation status on hemoglobin
glycation using both in vitro erythrocyte culture and clinical sample
analysis. (A) In vitro lysine modification and mass spectrometric

Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium containing either low glucose
(LG) (5.2 mmol/L) or high glucose (HG) (15.7 mmol/L). For different
experiments, erythrocytes were subjected to various treatments such
as aminoguanidine (AMG) 10 mM, unmodified serum albumin (SA) or carboxymethylated
serum albumin (CMSA) (15, 20, or 25 mg/mL), acetylated serum albumin
(AcSA) (25 mg/mL), and control and diabetic plasma (25 mg/mL plasma
protein). Hemoglobin glycation was assessed by measuring HbA1c level,
AGE-Hb fluorescence, Western blotting, and targeted SWATH-mass spectrometry
analysis. (C) Clinical study, Pearson’s correlation analysis

high glucose conditions. (A) Bar graph depicts HbA1c levels measured
using a Nycocard HbA1c analyzer. Albumin reduced HbA1c in a concentration-dependent

of albumin in high glucose conditions. (B) Bar graph shows AGE-Hb

to that of HbA1c and AGE-Hb fluorescence.

software. (C) Heat map of the area under the curve (AUC) of glycated
peptides of hemoglobin. The AUC of glycated peptides was higher in
erythrocytes maintained in high glucose conditions as compared to
that of those maintained in low glucose conditions. In addition, upon
albumin treatment, the AUC’s of these glycated peptides reduced
in a concentration-dependent manner. For example, the VCMHLTPEEK (CMV1-K8 of β-Hb)
peptide was found to be the most predominant glycated peptide among
all of the other glycated peptides of hemoglobin and albumin treatment
reduced the area under the curve (AUC) of glycated peptides in a concentration-dependent
manner. More or less all remaining glycated peptides showed a trend
similar to that of the VCMHLTPEEK (CMV1-K8 of β-Hb) peptide.

Low Albumin Concentration in Erythrocyte Culture was Associated
with Increase in Its Glycation
Unmodified albumin reduced
the hemoglobin glycation in a concentration-dependent manner in erythrocyte
culture, suggesting that it may competitively inhibit the glycation,
by itself getting glycated, because it has more number of freely accessible
lysine and arginine residues. To test this possibility, we analyzed
glycation of albumin using mass spectrometry. A total of 25 glycated
peptides were identified by the IDA approach, and 7 glycation-sensitive
peptides were consistently present in all of the acquisitions (Supporting Information Data 2 and File 1). Therefore, these peptides were selected
for targeted quantification.23,24 The area under the
curve (AUC) of glycated peptides was higher in high glucose than in
low glucose conditions. Furthermore, the area under the curve (AUC)
of glycated peptides was more at lower albumin concentration and vice
versa (Supporting Information Figure S2). This suggests that (i) at a higher concentration of albumin, relatively
more numbers of lysine and/or arginine are accessible for modification
and possibly not all of them get modified, thus leading to lower extent
of glycation, (ii) whereas at a lower concentration of albumin, relatively
lesser numbers of lysine and/or arginine residues are accessible for
modification and possibly majority of them get modified, thus leading
to higher extent of glycation. Hence, at a lower albumin concentration
due to increase in its own glycation, it may lose its ability to protect
glycation of other proteins. Conversely, a higher concentration of
albumin, due to its lesser glycation, may result in a better capability
to protect glycation of other proteins such as hemoglobin.

N(ε)-(Carboxymethyl)lysine-Modified Serum
Albumin (CMSA) Increases Hemoglobin Glycation
To corroborate
the role of albumin levels and its glycation status, albumin was modified
with glyoxylic acid to obtain CMSA and its ability to protect glycation
of hemoglobin was evaluated. CMSA was characterized mass spectrometrically.
A total of 25 CML-modified peptides of albumin were identified and
characterized (Table S1 and Supporting Information Data 3). Erythrocytes
maintained in the presence of various concentrations of CMSA at low
and high glucose concentrations were evaluated for hemoglobin glycation
by various methods. Unlike unmodified albumin, CMSA failed to protect
hemoglobin glycation as measured by HbA1c levels, AGE-Hb fluorescence,
Western blotting with anti-CML antibody, and mass spectrometry-based
quantification of glycated peptides of hemoglobin (Figure 4A–D). Instead, a strikingly
higher HbA1c level was observed with CMSA treatment as compared to
that with only low or high glucose treatment (Figure 4A).

glycation of hemoglobin from erythrocytes maintained at either low
or high glucose conditions with varying levels of CMSA (15, 20, and
25 mg/mL concentrations represented as L-CMSA, M-CMSA, and H-CMSA,
respectively) was monitored. (A) Bar graph represents HbA1c levels
measured using a Nycocard HbA1c analyzer. CMSA increased HbA1c levels
in a concentration-dependent manner. A higher level of CMSA (25 mg/mL)
increased HbA1c significantly as compared with lower levels of CMSA
(20 of 15 mg/mL) or absence of CMSA in high glucose conditions. (B)
Bar graph represents AGE-Hb fluorescence, which was monitored using
excitation and emission wavelengths of 308 and 345 nm, respectively,
and (C) Western blotting analysis of hemoglobin extracted from erythrocyte
culture was performed using anti-carboxymethyl antibody. The band
intensity of the glycated hemoglobin was higher in high glucose conditions
with 25 mg/mL CMSA treatment compared to that in low glucose conditions
with 25 mg/mL CMSA treatment. (D) Heat map of area under the curve
(AUC) of glycated peptides of hemoglobin. Glycated hemoglobin peptide
analysis was performed using targeted SWATH-MS analysis to validate
HbA1c analysis, AGE-Hb fluorescence, and Western blot analysis. The
AUC’s of glycated hemoglobin peptide was normalized with average
total ion count of all individual runs. The AUC of glycated peptides
were higher in erythrocytes maintained in high glucose conditions
as compared to that of those maintained in low glucose conditions.
In addition, upon CMSA treatment, the AUC’s of these glycated
peptides increased in a concentration-dependent manner.

Modification of Lysine Residues of Albumin
Impairs Its Ability
To Protect Hemoglobin Glycation
The above results suggest
that modification of lysine residues of albumin may impair its ability
to protect hemoglobin glycation, as treatment of CMSA led to an increase
in HbA1c levels. To examine the effect of lysine modification of SA
on its ability to protect hemoglobin glycation, lysine residues were
acetylated with acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) (aspirin). Acetylation
of lysine residues was confirmed mass spectrometrically. A total of
24 acetylated peptides with 24 lysine residues modified (Figure 5A; Table S2 and Supporting Information Data 4). Like CMSA, acetylated serum albumin (AcSA) failed to protect
hemoglobin glycation of erythrocytes maintained at high glucose concentration,
as measured by HbA1c levels, AGE-Hb fluorescence, and Western blotting
with anti-CML antibody, in comparison with unmodified albumin (Figure 5B–D). However,
AcSA was relatively less efficient compared with CMSA in increasing
hemoglobin glycation. These results unequivocally demonstrate that
albumin requires lysine residues to be maintained in an unmodified
state to protect the glycation of other proteins such as hemoglobin.

Figure 5 Modification
of lysine residues of albumin impairs its ability
to protect hemoglobin glycation. Erythrocytes were maintained in high
glucose (HG) media either with or without AcSA (25 mg/mL represented
as H-AcSA) or CMSA (25 mg/mL represented as H-CMSA). (A) MS/MS spectra

to reduce HbA1c in the erythrocytes maintained in high glucose media.
(C & D) AGE–hemoglobin fluorescence and Western blot analysis
performed for hemoglobin isolated from erythrocyte culture using anti-carboxymethyl
(CML) antibody showed a trend similar to that of HbA1c data.

Diabetic Plasma has Reduced
Ability To Protect Hemoglobin Glycation
Furthermore, we have
examined the effect of clinical plasma from
healthy and diabetic subjects on hemoglobin glycation in erythrocyte
culture. Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant plasma protein
and preferentially gets glycated in diabetes owing to its abundance,
as well as due to large number lysine and arginine residues accessible
for glycation.17 Therefore, the effect
of clinical plasma on hemoglobin glycation can be attributed to mainly
albumin and its glycation, although the effect of glucose, other metabolites,
and other proteins cannot be ruled out. Individual plasma obtained
from healthy control and diabetic subjects was analyzed for fasting
and postprandial blood glucose, HbA1c, plasma fructosamine, and albumin
levels (Table S3). Three individual plasma
samples from healthy control and diabetic subjects were pooled based
on fasting and postprandial blood glucose and HbA1c. The mean albumin
levels were relatively more in healthy control plasma (48.5 ±
3.6 g/L) than in the diabetic plasma (30.5 ± 4.7 g/L). However,
the mean plasma fructosamine in healthy control was 217.56 ±
14.7 μmol/L, whereas in diabetes, it was 410.4 ± 52.6 μmol/L.
Further glycation status of albumin was characterized and quantified
by IDA and SWATH-MS. Previously reported six glycation-sensitive peptides
were used for quantification (Figure 6A). The details of identification, characterization,
and quantification of glycated peptides are shown in Supporting Information Data 5 and File 1.23,24 The AUCs for these six glycated peptides
were significantly higher in diabetic plasma than in healthy control
plasma. Further treatment of healthy control plasma to erythrocytes
maintained in high glucose conditions reduced HbA1c levels. However,
diabetic plasma is relatively inefficient to reducing HbA1c. Although
both control and diabetic plasma reduced hemoglobin glycation of erythrocytes
maintained in high glucose conditions, as measured by HbA1c levels,
AGE-Hb fluorescence, and Western blotting (Figure 6B–D), the extent of decrease in hemoglobin
glycation was more with the treatment of control plasma than the diabetic
plasma. This data supports the fact that the albumin levels and its
glycation status influence hemoglobin glycation because albumin levels
were relatively low in pooled diabetic plasma, whereas its glycation
was relatively higher (Table S3).

Figure 6 Diabetic plasma
has reduced ability to protect hemoglobin glycation
erythrocytes were maintained in high glucose media either with healthy
control plasma or diabetic plasma. (A) Heat map represents the relative
quantification of AGE-modified peptides in serum albumin from clinical
plasma samples. Most of these glycated peptides were higher in diabetic
plasma than in control plasma, and, in addition, these were reported
as glycation-sensitive residue containing peptides in previous studies.
(B) Bar graph depicts HbA1c values. Erythrocytes maintained in the
presence of high glucose with healthy control plasma treatment showed
a significant decrease in HbA1c level as compared with erythrocytes
maintained only in high glucose media. However, treatment of erythrocytes
with diabetic plasma resulted in increase in the HbA1c level compared
to that from erythrocytes treated with healthy control plasma. (C
& D) AGE-Hb fluorescence and Western blot with anti-carboxymethyl
antibody showed a trend similar to that of HbA1c data.

HSA and HSA–Fructosamine are Negatively
and Positively
Associated with HbA1c, Respectively
Next, we investigated
whether the results of our in vitro experiments with erythrocyte culture
can be extended to clinical settings. A total of 75 blood plasma samples
collected from 25 subjects each of healthy control, prediabetes, and
diabetes were analyzed for various biochemical parameters such as
fasting and postprandial blood glucose, HbA1c, albumin, fructosamine
levels (Table S4 and Supporting Information File 1). The average HbA1c levels in
healthy control was 5.1 ± 0.2%, whereas in prediabetes and diabetes,
it was 5.9 ± 0.2% and 7.4 ± 0.9%, respectively. However,
the albumin levels were more in healthy control (46.49 ± 2.7
g/L) than in prediabetes (42.1 ± 2.4 g/L) and diabetes (39.1
± 3.0 g/L). Quantification of plasma fructosamine revealed that
it was maximum (570.3 ± 85.6 μmol/L) in diabetes followed
by prediabetes (457.2 ± 34.6 μmol/L) and healthy control
(304.1 ± 37.6 μmol/L). As plasma protein fructosamine reflects
the total plasma protein glycation, the relative plasma albumin fructosamine
(RAF), which is the contribution of albumin to plasma protein fructosamine,
was deduced from the ratio of albumin to total protein concentration
(Supporting Information File 1). The RAF
levels showed a trend similar to that of plasma protein fructosamine.
Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation was performed between HbA1c
and albumin, plasma fructosamine, or RAF levels, respectively (Figure 7A–C). HbA1c
and albumin levels showed a significant negative correlation (r = −0.6584, n = 75), as observed
in previous studies.11,12,14 However, plasma protein fructosamine (r = 0.7357, n = 75) and RAF (r = 0.6718, n = 75) showed positive correlation with HbA1c. The coefficients of
correlation between plasma protein fructosamine and RAF were more
or less same, suggesting that RAF contributes predominantly to plasma
protein fructosamine. Although it has been well established in many
previous studies that plasma protein fructosamine is positively associated
with HbA1c, we would like to hypothesize that RAF could determine
HbA1c outcome because it contributes predominantly to plasma protein
fructosamine.

of albumin,
plasma fructosamine, or relative albumin fructosamine (RAF). (A) Correlation
analysis showed significant negative correlation between HbA1c and
albumin levels (r = −0.6584 and p value (one-tail) <0.0001). (B) Correlation analysis showed significant

and (C) Correlation analysis showed significant positive correlation

Discussion
Glycated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) is considered as a gold standard for
the assessment of glycemic status in diabetes. It is important to
consider the confounding factors that influence HbA1c during treatment
and management of the disease. Many previous studies have shown that
various factors affect the HbA1c value, for example, the age and lifespan
of erythrocytes; intracellular glucose in erythrocytes; conditions
like anemia, splenomegaly, and pregnancy; ethnicity and gender; estimation
methods; chemical modifications such as glutathiolation and advanced
glycation such as carboxymethylation; antiglycation drugs such as
aspirin, etc.; iron-containing diet; and supplements (Table S5).10 Apart
from these factors, the plasma albumin level has been shown to be
negatively associated with HbA1c in a large cohort of diabetic subjects.11,12,14 The plausible explanation that
albumin could competitively protect hemoglobin glycation was derived
from previous studies where low albumin levels were associated with
increased glycation of plasma proteins including insulin, fibrinogen,
etc.13−15 In this study, we have unequivocally demonstrated
in erythrocyte culture that albumin levels influence hemoglobin glycation,
i.e., higher levels of albumin reduce hemoglobin glycation and vice
versa. At lower albumin levels, increased albumin glycation was observed,
which perhaps decreased its ability to reduce hemoglobin glycation.
This was substantiated by treatment of glycated albumin, i.e., CMSA,
which failed to reduce hemoglobin glycation; instead, it increased
hemoglobin glycation. The inability of CMSA to reduce hemoglobin glycation
was due to the lack of availability of free lysine residues of CMSA,
which otherwise competitively inhibited the glycation of hemoglobin.
This observation was corroborated by modifying lysine residues with
acetylation. For the first time, we demonstrate that modification
of lysine residues of albumin impairs its ability to inhibit hemoglobin
glycation. Furthermore, correlation studies between HbA1c and albumin
or RAF supported our in vitro experimental finding that albumin abundance
and its glycation status determine hemoglobin glycation in erythrocyte
culture. Therefore, it is quite plausible that albumin glycation precedes
hemoglobin glycation in vivo because albumin is the most abundant
protein in circulation with a large number of free lysine or arginine
residues accessible for glycation. Even though hemoglobin is 3–4
times more abundant than albumin, it is an intracellular protein and
has a relatively lesser number of lysine/arginine residues accessible
for glycation. Also, previous studies have shown that the percent
glycated albumin is relatively higher (control range (10–15%)
and diabetic range (18–30%)) than the percent glycated hemoglobin,
as measured by HbA1c (control 4–6% and diabetic 6.5–15%),25 which supports the hypothesis that albumin glycation
precedes hemoglobin glycation, although it is technically challenging
to prove this in clinical setting or in animal experiments. A cartoon
showing the relationship among albumin, glycated albumin, and HbA1c
levels is depicted in the TOC or graphical abstract figure. In vivo
glycated albumin can also increase HbA1c level by interacting with
the receptor for AGE, which causes oxidative stress, inflammation,
and insulin resistance, forming a vicious cycle.26

Conclusions and Outlook
This study demonstrates that
not only it is important to maintain
normal levels of albumin in diabetes but also this should be with
minimal glycation. This is the first study that highlights the role
of albumin and its glycation status in regulation of hemoglobin glycation
(HbA1c). Thus, we propose that quantification of albumin and glycated
albumin in conjunction with HbA1c has a great clinical significance
in management of diabetes.

Experimental Section
This study
was carried out to investigate the effect of albumin
abundance and its glycation status on hemoglobin glycation using in
vitro erythrocyte culture and clinical analysis. The overview of the
current study is depicted in Figure 1.

Chemicals
Bovine serum albumin (BSA),
glyoxylic acid,
sodium cyanoborohydride, dialysis membrane, and Penstrep were procured
from Sigma-Aldrich, MO. MS-grade solvents such as acetonitrile and
water were obtained from J.T. Baker, PA. Rapigest-SF was procured
from Waters Corporation, MA. Membrane cutoff filters of 3 kDa were
procured from Millipore, MA. RPMI-1640 medium was procured from GIBCO
Invitrogen. All other chemicals and reagents of analytical grade were
procured from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated.

In Vitro Synthesis
of CML-Modified Serum Albumin (CMSA) and
Acetylated Serum Albumin (AcSA)
Human serum albumin (HSA)
and BSA share a considerable amount of homology in their sequence
and structure;17 therefore, in all of the
experiments, BSA was used in place of HSA. CMSA was synthesized as
described earlier.27 Briefly, glyoxalic
acid (45 mM), BSA (50 mg/mL), and sodium cyanoborohydride (150 mM)
were dissolved in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated for
24 h in the dark at 37 °C. However, AcSA was synthesized as described
previously.28 Briefly, BSA (50 mg/mL) in
100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 10 mM acetyl salicylic acid (ASA)
was incubated for 24 h in the dark at 37 °C. Moreover, for unmodified
albumin, BSA was dissolved in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and
incubated for 24 h in dark at 37 °C. Consequently, both modified
and unmodified albumin were extensively dialyzed, followed by ultrafiltration
with 3 kDa cutoff membrane filters to remove the free glyoxalic acid/aspirin/salts
against sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 mol/L, pH 7.4, 350 μL).
The synthesis of CMSA and AcSA were confirmed by mass spectrometry
analysis, and the detailed mass spectrometry analysis procedure is
described below.

Erythrocytes Culture
Freshly drawn
human blood was
obtained from the Blood Bank. Blood was centrifuged (1500 rpm, 5 min
at 4 °C), plasma and buffy coat were aspirated, and the pellet
containing erythrocytes was washed thrice with 3 volumes of RPMI medium.
The washed erythrocytes (approximately 4 × 109 cells/mL)
were maintained in RPMI medium containing either low glucose (LG)
(5.2 mmol/L) or high glucose (HG) (15.7 mmol/L) concentration in a
T25 culture flask with antibiotic 1-X Penstrep.29−31 For different experiments, erythrocytes were subjected to various
treatments such as aminoguanidine (AMG) (10 mM), unmodified serum
albumin (SA) or carboxymethylated serum albumin (CMSA) (15, 20, or
25 mg/mL), acetylated serum albumin (AcSA) (25 mg/mL), and control
and diabetic plasma (25 mg/mL plasma protein) and were maintained
at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 7 days.

Measurement
of Hemoglobin Glycation
Hemoglobin glycation
was monitored by measuring HbA1c levels, AGE-Hb fluorescence, and
AGE-Hb by Western blotting with anti-CML antibody and mass spectrometry
analysis. The detailed procedure is given below.

HbA1c Analysis
For the measurement of HbA1c, the erythrocyte
pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 15 min at room
temperature to separate the medium. This pellet was used to measure
the HbA1c level by a Nycocard HbA1c analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
instruction.

AGE–Hemoglobin Fluorescence
Hemoglobin was isolated
from the erythrocyte pellet by vortexing with a buffer (7 M urea,
2 M thiourea, and 100 mM DTT in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer,
pH 8.3), followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. Thereafter, lysed
erythrocytes were centrifuged at 12 000g for
30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing hemoglobin was estimated
for protein concentration by Bradford’s assay. Hemoglobin (1.5
mg) was used for the measurement of AGE–hemoglobin fluorescence
with excitation/emission wavelength of 308/345 nm, respectively, using
a Varioskan flash multimode plate reader (Thermo Scientific) as described
earlier.32

Western Blot Analysis with
Anti-Carboxymethyl Antibody
Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
followed by Western blotting was performed with 5 μg of hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin was reduced and denatured by dissolving in Laemmli buffer
(5% β-mercaptoethanol and 10% SDS) and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE.
Then, the protein from the gel was transferred onto the polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membrane. For the confirmation of protein transfer,
Ponceau staining was performed and the stain was removed by washing
thrice with 1× PBS. The membrane was blocked using 5% skimmed
milk (HiMedia, India) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Then, the membrane
was probed with anti-carboxymethyl (1:2000) antibody (Abcam, Cambridge,
U.K.) for 2 h at room temperature. Following washing with PBS-T and
PBS, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody conjugated
to horseradish peroxidase (1:2500) antibody (Bangalore Genei, India)
for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were detected by chemiluminescence
using the WesternBright Quantum Western blotting detection kit (Bio-rad)
as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

Trypsin Enzymatic Digestion
of Proteins
Protein (100
μg); either hemoglobin isolated from erythrocytes or albumin
treated to erythrocytes/clinical plasma, or CMSA, AcSA; was diluted
to 100 μL with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer containing
0.1% RapiGest. Proteins were denatured at 80 °C for 15 min, subsequently
reduced with dithiothritol (100 mM) at 60 °C for 15 min, and
alkylated with iodoacetamide (200 mM) at room temperature in the dark
for 30 min. Proteins were digested with 2 μg of proteomic-grade
trypsin (1 μg/μL in 50 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate, Sigma-Aldrich)
at 37 °C for 14–16 h. Tryptic digestion was stopped by
addition of 2 μL of concentrated HCl. Digested peptides were
desalted using C18 Ziptips (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and
concentrated in a vacuum concentrator. Peptides were reconstituted
in 3% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid
for mass spectrometric analysis.27

Mass Spectrometric
Characterization of In Vitro Synthesized
CMSA and AcSA
Peptides (1.5 μg) of CMSA or AcSA were
loaded onto a reverse-phase C18 column (150 × 2.1
mm2, 1.9 μm) and separated on an UPLC (Accela 1250,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) online coupled to a Q-Exactive Orbitrap
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 350
μL/min for a duration of 45 min, using five gradient segments
(2–40% A for 35 min, 40–98% A for 2 min, held at 98%
A for 2 min, 98–2% A for 2 min, and held at 2% A for 4 min),
where A and B are solvent A (ACN (100%, v/v) with 0.1% formic acid
(0.1%, v/v)) and solvent B (aqueous water (100%, v/v) with 0.1% formic
acid (0.1%, v/v)), respectively. The mass spectra of eluted peptides
were acquired in a data-dependent manner using a hybrid quadruple
Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer in a positive acquisition mode,
with the precursor mass range of 350–2000 Da m/z (resolution at 70 000 with AGC target
1e6) and scan time of 120 ms. MS acquisition was performed
at precursor’s ion selection width of 2 Da m/z, under fill ratio of 0.3% and with dynamic exclusion
time of 15 s. The peptide fragmentation was achieved by high-energy
collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with 28 eV and fragment ion resolution
at 17 500 (MS/MS at m/z 400
Da) with AGC target 1e5 (MS/MS).27,33

Acquired mass spectral data was analyzed by Proteome Discover
software (PD 1.4.0.288, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Sequest-HT
as a search engine. The data were searched against bovine serum albumin
(UniProt IDs: P02769). Search parameters included trypsin as proteolytic
enzyme with two missed cleavages and 1% false discovery rate. Peptide
and fragment mass tolerance were set at 10 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively.
Search criteria included fixed and variable modifications as carbamidomethylation
(C) and oxidation (M), respectively. Additional variable lysine-specific
modifications included carboxymethylation ((CML) mass increment of
+58.0055 Da) and acetylation (mass increment of +42.0105 Da at lysine
residues).27,28,33,34 Carboxymethylated and acetylated albumin
peptides were manually validated for accurate mass shift in the precursor
ion due to modification and presence of fragment ions retaining modification,
and peptides with more than 1 XCorr value were considered as true
modified peptides.

Quantification of Glycated Peptides of Hemoglobin
and Albumin
by SWATH-MS Analysis
Mass spectral acquisition of glycated
peptides of hemoglobin and albumin was performed in using micro LC
200 (Eksigent; Dublin, CA) online coupled Triple-ToF 5600 (SCIEX)
in a high-sensitivity mode. For the development of spectral library,
mass spectral acquisition was done in an information-dependent manner
(IDA) and subsequently SWATH-MS was performed for relative quantification
of glycated peptides. Peptides (3 μg) were directly injected
onto an Agilent C18-RP HPLC column (100 × 0.3 mm2, 3 μm, 120 Å) and then separated using a 95 min
gradient of 3–40% mobile phase (mobile phase A: 100% water
(v/v) with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid; mobile phase B: 100% acetonitrile
(v/v) with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) at a flow rate of 8 μL/min.
Mass spectrometry parameters were set as follows: mass range from
400 to 1250 Da with an accumulation time of 0.25 ms at the MS level
and from 50 to 1999 Da with an accumulation time of 0.01 ms at the
MS/MS level. Fragmentation of peptides was done using rolling collision
energy of 28 kV.

For relative quantification, hemoglobin and
albumin peptides were individually analyzed in SWATH-MS (sequential
window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra) mode in three
biological and two technical replicates. Briefly, the peptide (1 μg)
was directly injected onto an Agilent C18-RP HPLC column
(100 × 0.3 mm2, 3 μm, 120 Å) and then separated
as mentioned in IDA data. In SWATH-MS mode, the instrument was specifically
optimized, the quadrupole settings for the selection of precursor
ion selection windows m/z of 25
Da wide with a 0.5 Da window overlap, a set of 34 overlapping windows
was constructed covering the precursor mass range of 400–1250
Da. SWATH-MS/MS spectra were collected from 50 to 1999 Da. The rolling
collision energy was optimized for each window with a spread of 25
kV. Dwell time of 70 ms was used for all fragment ion scans in high-sensitivity
mode, and for each SWATH-MS cycle acquired in high-resolution mode
for 100 ms, resulting in a duty cycle of 3.4.27

For the identification of glycated peptides of hemoglobin
or albumin
peptides listed from IDA acquisitions, the spectral data was analyzed
using ProteinPilot software (version 5.0; SCIEX) with respective database
by selecting the post-translational modification option. Identified
glycated peptides were manually verified for accurate precursor mass
and presence of modified fragment ions. Post SWATH-MS, the glycated
peptides were quantified extracting peak area using Peakview software
(version 2.2; SCIEX) by extracting precursor mass with an error of
0.001 Da and by retention time shift of ±1 min and the presence
of modified fragment ions was manually inspected. Considering all
of these parameters, the area under the curve (AUC) for glycated peptides
was obtained and normalized with average total ion counts for quantification.

Clinical Study
The blood samples were collected from
individual volunteers at Chellaram Diabetes Institute, Pune, with
an approval of Institutional Ethics Committee and patient written
consent, according to standard guidelines of American Diabetes Association
(ADA). Subjects with known history of cancer, hypothyroidism, hematuria,
and inflammatory diseases or any infection were excluded from the
study. This study involved 75 clinical subjects. After blood withdrawal,
biochemical parameters such as fasting plasma glucose, postprandial
glucose, hemoglobin, HbA1c, and lipid profile for each subject were
measured (detailed biochemical measurements are listed in Supporting
Information, Table S3). Subjects were divided
into three groups on the basis of glucose and HbA1c measurements:
(1) 25 controls (mean age 53.37 ± 11.27 years); (2) 25 prediabetes
subjects (mean age 56.8 ± 8.78 years); and (3) 25 controlled
diabetes subjects (mean age 58.74 ± 8.83 years). Remaining blood
collected was used for preparation of plasma using blood collection
tubes with K2EDTA (BD Vacutainer Plastic, Thermo Fisher
Scientific).

Total Plasma Protein Quantification
Plasma samples
were diluted 10-fold with Milli-Q water, and protein concentration
was determined by using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Protein
Assay: Bradford).35

Plasma Albumin
Measurement
Plasma albumin was estimated
using a bromocresol green-based colorimetric method (Sigma-Aldrich:
BCG (bromocresol green) albumin assay kit). Bromocresol green interacts
with albumin to form a chromophore, which was measured at 520 nm spectrophotometrically.11

Measurement of Plasma Protein Fructosamine
and Relative Plasma
Albumin Fructosamine (RAF) Level
Plasma protein fructosamine
was measured using a colorimetric fructosamine assay (Merck, NJ).
This colorimetric assay is based on the ability of ketoamines to reduce
nitrotetrazolium blue to formazan in an alkaline solution. The rate
of formazan formation is directly proportional to the concentration
of plasma protein fructosamine.11 The relative
plasma albumin fructosamine (RAF) was calculated by deducing from
the ratio of albumin to total protein concentration.

Statistical
Analysis
All in vitro erythrocytes experiments
were performed in three biological replicates and mass specta were
acquired in two technical replicates for library creation and in technical
triplicates for the SWATH-MS-based quantification, and to corroborate
the findings of in vitro erythrocyte culture experiments, albumin,
plasma fructosamine, relative albumin fructosamine, and HbA1c levels
were analyzed in clinical subjects (n = 75, technical
triplicates). All of the statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The values of HbA1c,
AGE-Hb fluorescence, and AUCs represent mean with standard deviation.
The statistical significance was calculated using two-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) analysis. p values were calculated
and the level of significance was set at p < 0.05
(ns—no significance (p > 0.05), *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001). The correlation between different variables
was estimated
using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and was examined with
an ANOVA model.
