For synthesizing glycerol carbonate
(GC) by a reaction between
glycerol (GL) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), a lipase immobilized on
magnetic organosilica nanoflowers was prepared and utilized as a biocatalyst. Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) was chosen as
a model enzyme for preparing an immobilized biocatalyst (CALB@nanoflowers).
The obtained CALB@nanoflowers was characterized using scanning electron
microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning
microscopy. Effects of GL/DMC molar ratio, biocatalyst amount, temperature,
surfactant and molecular sieve addition, and reaction time on the
conversion of GL and the selectivity of CALB@nanoflowers were investigated.
The optimal catalytic performance (yield of GC: 88.66% and conversion
of GL: 94.24%) was achieved under the condition of 1:20 molar ratio
of GL to DMC with 0.2 g of molecular sieves added at 50 °C for
24 h. After recycling seven times, the CALB@nanoflowers maintained
over 79% of its initial activity and the yield of GC was 70.31%.

1 Introduction
With
the biodiesel manufacture fast developed, a large amount of
glycerol (GL) was obtained.1,2 GL can be used in various
industries such as textiles, foods, drugs, and cosmetics, and it can
also be a platform molecule in high-value chemical synthesis after
purification.3 Recently, researchers have
transformed GL into a multitude of high value-added chemicals such
as ethers, propanediols, bulk chemicals, and glycerol carbonate (GC).3−6

GC (4-hydroxymethyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one) is one of the most
important
value-added products that can be derived from GL.5,7,8 Because of its ideal physicochemical properties
including low toxicity, high boiling point, nonflammability, and good
biodegradability, GC has been adopted as a green solvent for chemical
maquillages, skincare products, and medicine.9 GC was also used as an additive of chemical coatings, paints, and
detergents as well as a precursor of polycarbonates and polyurethanes.10,11 Studies for developing procedures of GC synthesis have drawn much
attention these years because of its potential industrial applications
in various sectors.12

In previous
reports, chemical catalysts were usually adopted for
transesterification of GL with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to produce
GC.7,13,14 However, the
drawbacks including high energy requirements, low catalyst recovery
rate, and high pollution of the environment are major disadvantages
in chemical catalyzed synthesis processes.12,15−17 Enzymatic transesterification of GL with DMC was
considered to be one of the compelling candidates of chemical catalysis
as a green catalysis route.18,19 According to the literature,
the reactions include transesterification, hydrolysis, and the further
intramolecular cyclization process, and then equimolar GL and DMC
are required by the reaction stoichiometry.20 However, the side reaction is influenced by various factors such
as the reagent ratio of GL/DMC, the type of catalysts, and temperature.21 Thus, various factors should be considered and
investigated in the process of GC synthesis.

Lipases (triacylglycerol
ester hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.3), a kind of
green catalyst, are widely used in hydrolysis, esterification, cyclo-esterification,
and transesterification reactions in consideration of their outstanding
chemo-, region-, and stereoscopic-selective performances.22,23 As we all know, lipases perform catalysis via a peculiar catalytic
mechanism known as interfacial activation. Interfacial activation
is the phenomenon that an oligopeptide blocks the active center of
lipases under the normal environment and exposes the activity center
under hydrophobic interface.24−28 However, free lipase was usually limited by easily deactivation,
poor use stability particularly that difficulties to be reusable.29 Fortunately, lipases immobilized onto solid
carriers could overcome these weaknesses effectively.30−32 Immobilization techniques can maintain the activity of enzymes and
improve their stability. If materials and methods can be properly
designed, immobilization can also improve many enzyme features, for
example, selectivity, specificity, thermal stability, and reusability.33−36

Up to now, various solid supports (e.g., silica, polymer,
carbon,
and some composite materials) have been demonstrated to be able to
immobilize lipases.23,37,38 It is worth mentioning that the activity and stability of the immobilized
catalysts can be increase a lot in nonaqueous solvents while the carriers
with hydrophobic surfaces due to the hydrophobic-cap structure and
interfacial effect of the lipase.39−41 Recently, a novel kind
of organosilica nanoflower with a magnetic Fe3O4 core and a flowerlike organosilica radial-wrinkle shell was reported
by our group.40 The remarkable properties
of novel magnetic organosilica nanoflowers make them perfect supports
for lipase immobilization: (1) The flowerlike organosilica with a
radial-wrinkle shell around the magnetic Fe3O4 core can reduce the inevitable aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles.42−44 (2) The hydrophobicity of organosilica can promote the catalytic
performance of lipases.45,46 (3) A large specific
surface area of the nanoflowers can enhance the enzyme loading and
promote the mass transfer. It has to be explained that a favorable
temperature and gentle stirring are important to gain a uniform flowerlike
organosilica radial-wrinkle shell.40 Additionally,
magnetic core–shell nanoparticles have been adopted as supports
for enzyme immobilization because of the ease of separation by magnetic
fields.42,43 When lipases are immobilized on magnetic
nanoparticles, the composites can be easily separated from the reaction
medium, which can improve the reusability of the enzyme.44

Thus, in this work, magnetic organosilica
nanoflowers have been
chosen as a carrier for immobilizing Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) via covalent binding method to construct nanobiocatalysts
named CALB@nanoflowers.40,47 CALB, a typical lipase,
has been commonly used as an industrial enzyme. The amphiphilic α-helix
in CALB, also called a lid, can shelter the active site from the substrate
or be removed in the hydrophobic environment for exposing the active
center to substrate.48 Then, CALB@nanoflowers
was used as a catalyst for the transesterification of GL with DMC
and the follow-up cyclo-esterification in the synthesis of GC for
the first time (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Preparation of CALB@Nanoflowers and Synthesis of GC Catalyzed
by
CALB@Nanoflowers
In particular, the transesterification of GL with DMC
is a kinetically
controlled reaction, which means that the enzyme properties and activation
of substrate may influence transient maximum yields.34,35,49,50 The magnetic CALB@nanoflowers was characterized by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal
laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Factors that would affect the yield
of GC and the selectivity of CALB@nanoflowers were investigated in
detail. Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of this catalyst was compared
with those of the reported biocatalysts. Reusability of the magnetic
CALB@nanoflowers was also appraised.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Nanoflowers
and CALB@Nanoflowers
As shown in the SEM image (Figure 1a), the nanoflowers
are particles that have a well-proportioned
size of ∼270 nm and an obvious flowerlike morphology. As shown
in Figure S1, the width of radial-wrinkle
perpendicular channels is about 14 nm, which was consistent with the
result of our previous report.40 The TEM
image showed that the nanoflowers had a core–shell structure
and the thickness of the organosilica shell was ca. 45 nm (Figure 1b). The results recorded
on a vibrating sample magnetometer verified the satisfactory magnetism
of nanoflowers (62 emu/g) and CALB@nanoflowers (37 emu/g).

of the silica nanoflowers; (b) TEM image of the silica
nanoflowers; (c) photographs of CALB@nanoflowers separated from aqueous
solution by a magnet; and (d) CLSM image of the FITC-labeled CALB@nanoflowers.

Similar to other magnetic nanoparticles,
the nanoparticles can
be separated easily by a magnet (Figure 1c) rather than a centrifuge, which may reduce
the costs of industrial application.51 To
verify the success of immobilization, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled
CALB (FITC-CALB) was immobilized by nanoflowers. As shown in Figure 1d, the fluorescence
of the immobilized enzyme particles proved the successful immobilization
of CALB on nanoflowers.52,53 Under the optimal immobilization
conditions, the maximum loading of CALB on the nanoflowers was 93
mg/gsupport while the specific enzyme activity was 244.1
U/mgprotein.40 Compared with
the specific enzyme activity of free CALB (647.6 U/mgprotein), the activity recovery is 37.69%.

2.2 Synthesis
of GC
The production of
GC was performed based on the transesterification reaction between
GL (1) and DMC (2) using CALB@nanoflowers as a catalyst. According
to the literature,20,21 the reaction mechanism is presented
in Figure 2. Interactions
between GL and DMC lead to a short-life intermediate (3) and methanol.
Further, intramolecular cyclization of the short-life intermediate
causes it to remove one molecular methanol and generate GC (4). Side
products of this reaction might be glycerol dicarbonate (GDC) (5)
or diglycerol tricarbonate (DGTC) (6).16

Figure 2 Scheme
of GC synthesis from GL with DMC catalyzed by a lipase.

The reaction was investigated in detail in the
presence of CALB@nanoflowers
under various reaction conditions for improving GL conversion and
catalyst selectivity and reducing side reaction. Otherwise, several
solvents were adopted to investigate the effect of solvents on the
conversion of GL and the selectivity of immobilized enzyme.16 As shown in Figure S2, the added organic solvents are adverse to the reaction. Thus, a
solvent-free system was adopted in the subsequent research.21

2.3 Effect of GL/DMC Molar
Ratio
The
influence of the molar ratio of GL to DMC on GL conversion and catalyst
selectivity is depicted in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 2, the reaction stoichiometry requires a molar ratio
of GL to DMC of 1:1 and 1 mol of GL can yield 1 mol of GC in theory.54 As presented in Figure 3, the transformation of GL increased from
44.01 to 87.03% with changing the GL/DMC ratio from 1:1 to 1:20. With
further increase of DMC, the transformation of GL increases negligibly.
GC was synthesized at a low GL/DMC ratio; subsequently, the side product
formed with increasing DMC amounts and the selectivity of the CALB@nanoflowers
decreased by raising the GL/DMC ratios from 1:1 to 1:20.

Figure 3 GL conversion
and the CALB@nanoflowers selectivity with different
GL/DMC molar ratios.

The reason might be that GL owns two types of hydroxyl and
the
two primary alcohol groups are more active than the secondary hydroxyl
group, and it also leads to higher selectivity.55,56 Otherwise, the turbidity of the reaction mixture increased with
the increase of DMC concentration, which reduces the interaction of
CALB@nanoflowers with GL, thereby reducing conversion.54 Especially, the conversion and selectivity seem
to change little while the GL/DMC ratio changes from 1:20 to 1:40.
Therefore, in the subsequent experiments, 1:20 ratio of GL to DMC
was chosen for attaining not only high transformation of GL but also
acceptable selectivity.

2.4 Effect of Biocatalyst Concentration
The biocatalyst concentration also exerts a significant effect
on
the conversion of GL. As shown in Figure 4, conversion of GL was increased from 48.63
to 86.78% as the CALB@nanoflowers concentration was increased from
2 to 10 g/L in a solvent-free system. The GL conversion was not significantly
increased from 86.78 to 89.32% with further increasing the CALB@nanoflowers
concentration from 10 to 40 g/L, whereas the selectivity suffers a
slight decrease in this range of biocatalyst concentrations (2–40
g/L).

Figure 4 GL conversion and the CALB@nanoflowers selectivity with different
biocatalyst concentrations.

The yield of GC decreased because the amount of enzyme is
excess
for achieving a maximum yield. Once the maximum yield has been achieved
under a 10 g/L catalyst concentration at 24 h, excess catalyst only
can be used to make side product during the transesterification reaction.57,58 Under this condition, part of the GC is converted to GDC or DGTC
by the excess catalysts, and then the GC yield did not increase, though
the conversion and selectivity changed slightly.59 A concentration of 10 g/L was chosen for achieving economy
application and sufficiently high performances in subsequent experiments.

2.5 Effect of Molecular Sieve Addition
To select
proper molecular sieve addition for GC production, different
amounts of molecular sieves (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 g) were used
in this experiment. As illustrated by the results in Figure 5, the conversion of GL was
increased from 71.96 to 86.78% with 0.2 g of molecular sieves being
added. Further increasing the amount of molecular sieves added to
1.6 g, GL conversion was decreased to 66.28%. The same phenomenon
was observed for the selectivity of the biocatalyst. As one of the
products, inevitably produced methanol has an inhibitory effect on
enzyme activity and stability. Although a certain amount of water
is required for acquisition and maintenance of lipase activity, excess
water also triggers many enzyme inactivation processes.60,61 Molecular sieves can remove excess water in the solvent-free system.
However, excess molecular sieves can reduce the reaction rate by adsorbing
the essential water, which can restrain the interactions between enzyme
and substrate.19 Thus, 0.2 g of molecular
sieves was enough to maintain essential water content in a microenvironment
and was selected in the further tests.

Figure 5 GL conversion and CALB@nanoflowers
selectivity with different amounts
of molecular sieve addition.

2.6 Effect of Temperature
Temperature
plays a significant role in affecting the viscosity of the reaction
mixture, activation energy of substrate, and the activity of enzyme.12 Thus, the reaction temperature was investigated.

As shown in Figure 6, conversion of GL increased from 46.25 to 94.24% with the temperature
being increased from 40 to 50 °C. With the temperature being
further increased to 70 °C, the conversion of GL decreased to
68.98% and the selectivity of CALB@nanoflowers was decreased from
97.81 to 74.60%. A high reaction temperature might lead to the loss
of enzyme activity and selectivity because of the thermal denaturation.16 Deactivation of the enzyme makes it difficult
to maintain a high GL conversion and also may reduce the yield of
GC. Therefore, 50 °C was chosen as an optimal temperature.

Figure 6 GL conversion
and CALB@nanoflowers selectivity at different temperatures.

2.7 Effect
of Reaction Time
The effect
of reaction time was researched in detail with the range of 1–27
h, and the results are shown in Figure 7. It can be found that a GL conversion of 38.05% and
a GC yield of 34.27% were obtained at 3 h. The increase of reaction
time to 6 h gave 67.67% conversion of GL and 60.40% yield of GC. As
the kinetically controlled synthesis reaction,49,50 under the optimal conditions from above experiments, the reaction
almost established kinetic equilibrium after 24 h (94.24% of GL conversion
and 88.66% of GC yield). Further lengthening of reaction time to 27
h had a slight influence on both the conversion and the yield. Thus,
24 h was used in the subsequent reactions.

Figure 7 GL conversion and CALB@nanoflowers
selectivity with different reaction
times.

2.8 Effect
of Surfactant Addition
In
the traditional process of GC production, the hydrophilic GL and the
hydrophobic DMC are nonmiscible. A surfactant that contains both hydrophilic
and hydrophobic components might solve the problem efficiently by
reducing the surface tension at the interface between the substrates
and helping reactants to mix well.62,63 Thus, to further
increase the GC yield, Tween 20, Tween 80, and Triton X-100 (10%,
v/v) were added during the reaction process.

As shown in Figure 8, the addition of
Triton X-100 enhanced the GL conversion from 94.24 to 96.25% and the
selectivity of CALB@nanoflowers was also increased, which was similar
to previous report.63 In contrast, the
conversion of GL and the selectivity of CALB@nanoflowers were decreased
by adding Tween 20 (68.93 and 82.86%) and Tween 80 (76.63 and 85.71%)
in comparison with the control experiments (94.24 and 94.08%). This
phenomenon might be due to the fact that the system viscosity was
increased, which caused the mass transfer resistance to increase,
while surfactants were added.62

and CALB@nanoflowers selectivity with different surfactants.

2.9 Reusability
of CALB@Nanoflower
The
reusability of the CALB@nanoflowers was researched at optimized condition
for GC production. For comparison, CALB immobilized on core–shell
magnetic pure silica spheres with a flowerlike morphology (named CALB@MMPS)
and Novozym 435 (N435) with the same initial activity were also tested
in the same condition. The results are depicted in Figure 9. After recycling seven times,
the CALB@nanoflowers maintained more than 79% of its initial activity
and the yield of GC was 70.31%, which were much higher than those
of CALB@MMPS (ca. 60 and 29.37%) and commercial N435 (ca. 17 and 9.898%).
The CALB@nanoflowers maintained about 84% of its initial selectivity
(94.13%), whereas the CALB@MMPS and commercial N435 maintained about
80 and 65% of their initial selectivity, respectively (90.25 and 93.15%).

Figure 9 Reusability
of CALB@nanoflowers and other immobilized lipases in
GC production.

The better reusability
of the CALB@nanoflowers than N435 in this
reaction can be due to the fact that immobilization of CALB on mesoporous
materials could prevent interprotein polymerization more availably
than the immobilization of CALB on macroporous materials.40 The performance of CALB@nanoflowers is obviously
superior to that of CALB@MMPS, which can be interpreted by the following
reasons. First of all, covalent immobilization is a better method
to link enzyme molecules to solid carriers, providing little leakage
than the adsorption method.64,65 Second, it can also
be attributed to the hydrophobicity of the nanoflowers.40,45 Hydrophobic nanoflowers have more appetency to attract hydrophobic
substrates than hydrophilic MMPS, which obviously increased the apparent
activity of the CALB@nanoflowers in nonaqueous phase reaction.39,41,46

2.10 Biological
Conversion of GL to GC Using Various
Biocatalysts
The comparison of the catalytic activity of
CALB@nanoflowers with those of other reported biocatalysts in the
conversion of GL into GC is provided in Table 1. It was found that N435 exhibited excellent
activity during the transesterification in a cosolvent system, but
the product was difficult to be separated from the substrate–solvent–product
mixture.55,62,67 For a solvent-free
system, various catalysts have been investigated for the GC synthesis,
including N435, cross-linked enzyme aggregate onto magnetic particles
(CLEMPA), Aspergillus niger (AN), and
lipase-linked magnetic macro-/nanoparticles (lipase-MP3).16,21,68−70 Compared with reported biocatalysts, CALB@nanoflowers had high catalytic
activity and even retained a high catalytic efficiency with a GC yield
of 70.31% after recycling seven times (Figure 9). The relatively high GC yield and high
recyclability demonstrated that CALB@nanoflowers was an efficient
biocatalyst for the transesterification of GL with DMC. These results
thereby suggested that CALB@nanoflowers had great potential in industrial
applications.

3 Conclusions
This work was contributed to optimize the condition
of enzymatic
production of GC from glycerolation of DMC catalyzed by an innovative
immobilized lipase (CALB@nanoflowers) in an eco-friendly route. At
the optimum conditions of the amount of enzyme (5 g/L), molecular
sieves (0.2 g), and GL/DMC molar ratio (1:20), the yield of GC was
88.66% at 50 °C after 24 h in the solvent-free system. In general,
these results implied that CALB@nanoflowers can efficiently be used
as a catalyst to develop an enzymatic route for GC synthesis.

4.2 Preparation of the Magnetic
Organosilica Nanoflowers
and CALB@Nanoflowers
4.2.1 Synthesis of Magnetic
Organosilica Nanoflowers
Briefly, an aqueous solution of
diaminomethanal (0.4 M, 100 g)
was added into a round-bottom flask with 0.3 g of the as-prepared
Fe3O4 particles. Then, a solution containing
CTAB (1.25 g), n-butyl alcohol (1.25 g), cyclohexane
(5 g), and a mixture of TEOS (0.875 g) and BTSE (0.375 g) were added
orderly at 25 °C under gentle stirring for 30 min. When the temperature
was raised to 70 °C, the reaction continues for another 24 h
under gentle stirring. To remove the templates, the nanoflowers were
dispersed in 250 mL of acetone, refluxed at 80 °C for 48 h, and
dried at 60 °C for 12 h.40

4.2.2 Synthesis of CALB@Nanoflowers
Before
the immobilization of lipase, the nanoflowers were amino-functionalized
by APTES and were activated by glutaraldehyde (0.4 wt %).40 The activated nanoflowers (glutaraldehyde nanoflowers,
100 mg) were dispersed in 5 mL of phosphate buffer solution (PBS,
0.1 M, pH 7.0) by ultrasonication for 10 min. Then, 5 mL of CALB solution
(4.128 mg/mL) was added, and the mixed solution was shaken (170 rpm)

followed by the addition of CALB@nanoflowers (30 g/L). The mixture
was incubated by a thermostatic shaker (170 rpm) at 60 °C and
kept for 24 h. Then, it was cooled to room temperature, and CALB@nanoflowers
was separated by a magnet.

For exact analysis, 0.1 g of tert-butanol was added as an internal standard to determine
the GC and GL. After diluting by 10 mL of tert-butanol,

°C at a 10 °C·min–1 rising rate and
ramping of 15 °C·min–1 up to 200 °C,
and lasted for 12.33 min. All computational formulas are detailed
in the Supporting Information.

4.4 Optimization of Reaction Conditions
4.4.1 Effect
of the Molar Ratio of GL to DMC
The effect of molar ratio
of GL/DMC on the conversion of GL and
the selectivity of immobilized enzyme was investigated at various
GL/DMC molar ratios (1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, and 1:40). In a solvent-free
system, the mixture of GL (2.5 mmol), DMC (different amount), CALB@nanoflowers
(30 g/L), and molecular sieves (0.8 g) was shaken in a thermostatic
shaker at 60 °C for 24 h.

4.4.2 Effect
of Catalyst Concentration
The effect of catalyst concentration
on the conversion of GL and
the selectivity of immobilized enzyme was investigated at various
enzyme concentrations (2, 6, 10, 20, 30, and 40 g/L). In a solvent-free
system, the mixture of GL (2.5 mmol), DMC (50 mmol), CALB@nanoflowers,
molecular sieves (0.8 g) was shaken in a thermostatic shaker at 60
°C for 24 h.

4.4.3 Effect of Molecular Sieve
Concentration
The effect of amount of molecular sieves on
the conversion of GL
and the selectivity of immobilized enzyme was investigated at various
amounts of molecular sieves (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 g). In a solvent-free
system, the mixture of GL (2.5 mmol), DMC (50 mmol), CALB@nanoflowers
(10 g/L), different mounts of molecular sieves was shaken in a thermostatic
shaker at 60 °C for 24 h.

4.4.4 Effect
of Temperature
To investigate
the effect of temperature on the conversion of GL and the selectivity
of immobilized enzyme, the reactions were performed at different temperatures
(40, 50, 60, and 70 °C). In a solvent-free system, the mixture
of GL (2.5 mmol), DMC (50 mmol), CALB@nanoflowers (10 g/L), molecular
sieves (0.2 g) was shaken in a thermostatic shaker at 60 °C for
24 h at different temperatures.

4.4.5 Effect
of Surfactant Addition
To
investigate the effect of surfactant on the conversion of GL and the
selectivity of immobilized enzyme, several kinds of surfactants (Tween
20, Triton X-100, and Tween 80, 10 v/v %) were added. In a solvent-free
system, the mixture of GL (2.5 mmol), DMC (50 mmol), CALB@nanoflowers
(10 g/L), molecular sieves (0.2 g), and surfactant (10 v/v %) was
shaken in a thermostatic shaker at 60 °C for 24 h.

4.4.6 Effect of Reaction Time
In a solvent-free
system, the mixture of GL (2.5 mmol), DMC (50 mmol), CALB@nanoflowers
(10 g/L), molecular sieves (0.2 g), and Triton X-100 (10%, v/v) was
shaken in a thermostatic shaker at 50 °C. The progress was computed
by measuring the amount of GL and GC during the reaction.

4.5 Reusability of CALB@Nanoflower
Reusabilities
of the CALB@nanoflowers and N435 were compared by repetitive uses
in the transesterification of GL with DMC at optimal conditions. CALB@nanoflowers
and N435 were magnetically and centrifugally recovered from reaction
media, respectively, followed by the washing with DMC several times
before being used in the next reaction batch.
