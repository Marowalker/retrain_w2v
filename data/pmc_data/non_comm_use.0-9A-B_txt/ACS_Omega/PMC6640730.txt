Nanoclays are small enough to appear
optically transparent, yet
they have large surface-to-volume and high aspect ratios that can
significantly inhibit water diffusion when incorporated into protective
coatings. Clear coatings, which minimally affect the aesthetics of
metalworks, are commonly applied to outdoor metalworks, such as sculptures,
to prevent and slow corrosion. In recent years, waterborne clear coatings,
rather than solvent-based clear coatings, are increasingly used in
many applications to reduce the quantity of volatile organic components
in the formulation, yet the performance of dry films produced from
waterborne colloidal suspensions is generally poorer. In this work,
we aim to improve the barrier properties of a highly weatherable waterborne
acrylic/polyvinylidene fluoride emulsion by adding a synthetic nanoclay,
Laponite, into the formulation. To improve clay–polymer compatibility,
the clay was covalently modified using an acetoxy or perfluoroalkyl
silane monomer that is reactive with the hydroxyl groups at the edges
of the Laponite platelets. Cation exchange on the clay faces using
phosphorylcholine was conducted to increase the stability in water
and characterized by zeta potential. Resulting changes in barrier
properties of the polymer nanocomposite films were characterized by
gravimetry, colorimetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
Surface ablation after accelerated artificial weathering was monitored
by attenuated total internal reflectance Fourier transform infrared
microspectroscopy and Raman microspectroscopy, thin film X-ray diffraction
(TF-XRD) and gloss and thickness
measurements. The composite films showed many improved properties:
reduced water sensitivity and ultraviolet-induced polymer degradation,
which increased the barrier properties and reduced the diffusion constants
over both short- and long-term weathering studies compared with films
without nanoclays. The diffusion constant measured for the highest
performing composite film showed that the performance gap between
relevant water- and solvent-borne coatings used to protect outdoor
metals was narrowed by half.

1 Introduction
With
protective coatings, it is possible to minimize corrosion
of outdoor metalworks, such as bridges, architectural elements, and
sculptures, by preventing or slowing the passage of water and ions
into the metal substrate. Protective coatings are often pigmented
because pigment particles can act to further slow mass transport of
corrosives through films. However, the use of optically transparent
coatings is preferable when the ability to see the substrate is a
critical feature for aesthetic and preventative maintenance reasons.
Previous work by us and others has shown that polymeric coatings containing
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) have longer working lifetimes than
polyacrylics and other polymers because of excellent chemical and
thermal stability.1−4 Yet, it has also been shown that water uptake into waterborne latex
coatings is greater than solvent-based coatings due to voids in the
film caused by spherical close-packing defects, resulting in both
a measurable decrease of barrier properties and visible water whitening
of the transparent film.5 In this work,
we aim to reduce mass transport into those films by incorporating
optically transparent nanoclays that have been chemically modified
with acetoxy or perfluoroalkylsilanes to lower their surface energies
and increase their dispersibility and compatibility within the coating.
Incorporation of nanoclays into the resulting dry film should create
a tortuous path that would slow diffusion of ions through the coating
to the metal substrate.6−8 Such composite films are expected to have increased
overall barrier properties, resulting in prolonged working lifetimes
and reduced corrosion of the underlying metal substrate. To our knowledge,
fluorinated nanoclays have not been incorporated into waterborne PVDF/acrylic
coatings. Most previous studies involving Laponite polymer nanocomposites
(PNCs) used styrene and butyl acrylate dispersions,9−11 which are not
as suitable as PVDF for long-term weatherability.

Incorporation
of nanosized inorganics into thermoplastic coatings
should result in films having increased hydrophobicity, film hardness,
and inhibited water diffusion, while retaining optical clarity and
easy spray application.12,13 Laponite is a synthetic
silicate nanoclay in the smectite family, depicted in Figure 1A. The unique properties of
clays come from their high aspect ratios (25), specific surface area
(350 m2/g), discoid single crystals, and charged surfaces.
They are often used as rheology modifiers because the charged interfaces
act to control diffusion in wet suspensions and as such have been
used to create a range of phases from sols to gels and charged glasses.14,15 Laponite and other smectite clays have a concentration-dependent
phase diagram, where the amount, pH, and dielectric constant of the
bulk solvent play an integral role in inhibiting or facilitating particle
interactions. These factors also affect the electrostatic interactions
when the clay is added to a colloidal organic polymer suspension.16 The density and organization of the charges
around the particle and thickness of the slipping plane can be measured
by the zeta potential, where high potentials (large in absolute magnitude)
lead to particle repulsion and low potentials (small in absolute magnitude)
lead to flocculation due to small slipping planes that are overcome
by attractive forces. At near-neutral pH values, expansion of sodium
cations out of the interlayer space induces a negatively charged face
and partial positive charge along the edge of the platelet, as depicted
in Figure 1B.17 The mobile interlayer sodium cations encourage
the clay to swell in water producing exfoliated (individual) 3-layered
(T–O–T) inorganic sheets. Like many clays, Laponite
is highly modifiable, in that it has both accessible hydroxyl groups
available for silanation on the sheet’s broken edge and exchangeable
cations that balance the negative faces.18−21

Figure 1 Single unit cell formula for Laponite
is Na0.7[(Si8Mg5.5Li0.3)O20(OH)4]. A typical 25 × 1.29 nm platelet,
abbreviated as LNa (a),
contains approximately 1000 unit cells per discoid. Chemical modification
of the clay surface (b) results in the covalent attachment of APTMS
(LA) or FOTES (LF) at the tetrahedral edge and ionic exchange on the
face with Pc (resulting in Laponite-APTMS-phosphoryl choline (LAPc)
or Laponite-FOTES-phosphoryl choline (LFPc)).

The relative strength of stacking (attractive) versus dispersive
(repulsive) forces must be carefully balanced to prevent nanoclay
agglomeration and promote exfoliation. To produce aqueous dispersions,
modification of the nanoclay was accomplished by (1) covalent reactions
with acetoxy or perfluoroalkylsilanes to increase the chemical compatibility
between clay and latex particles and (2) cation exchange reactions
using phosphorylcholine (Pc) to charge-stabilize the covalently functionalized
nanoclays. With surface modification, the balance of those attractive/repulsive
forces is altered, so the amount and type of surface coverage can
have a significant influence on the dispersibility. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy were used to verify surface
functionalization. Gallery spacing measurements were conducted using
wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). Particle–particle interactions
of wet suspensions of nanoclays and polymer were characterized by
zeta potential measurements.

If not well-formulated, mechanical
strain in composite films can
result in cracking upon drying and/or weathering due to increased
hardness and latex packing defects that increase the water volume
fraction of the material.22,23 Other voids and defects
in films are produced over time from the loss or surface migration
of inorganic fillers (such as pigments or clays). Although there are
both environmental and cost motivations to produce coatings from waterborne
polymeric dispersions, the resulting films are more permeable to water
due to their chemistry and film-formation mechanism.24 Adsorption of water droplets in voids that are sufficiently
large to scatter white light will whiten transparent films.5 In this work, mass transport was monitored using
colorimetry, gravimetry, and impedance spectroscopy.

To simulate
the effects of weathering, the films were exposed to
ultraviolet (UV) light and condensation cycles in an industry-standard
accelerated weathering chamber (QUV).3 Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a nondestructive technique for monitoring
dielectric properties of materials5,24−26 and has been shown to produce similar or more sensitive results
as attenuated total internal reflectance Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) or gravimetric methods for detecting water
uptake into polymers.27−30 Films that enable facile passage of water and electrolytes (i.e.,
corrosives) are more poorly protective, and such
films will have larger capacitances and larger diffusion constants
than those that are highly protective. By fitting
equivalent electrical circuits (EECs) to the EIS spectral output,
the data are dissected into frequency ranges where different circuit
elements are dominant. In addition, the values of each element are
monitored for changes over time. Because temperature and humidity
fluctuations during weathering eventually lead to coating failure
such as cracking, time-course EIS spectra of films are used to prove
insights into the electrochemical changes that occur leading up to
failure. Gloss and film thickness measurements provided insights into
bulk film changes.

During the lifetime of an outdoor coating,
significant chemical
changes may also occur that have a deleterious effect on its protective
quality. The acrylic component of the PVDF resin is chemically similar
to the polymer used in the primer coat of the PNCs. The acrylic polymer
is a commonly used solvent-based coating for the protection of bronzes
(Paraloid B-44).25,31−34 In previous work, we have observed
that loss of the ester functionality is the primary means of material
loss and is the pathway of the degradation for PMMA-co-PEA during outdoor and accelerated weathering.35 Although solvent-based acrylic coatings are commonly used
as protective coatings, their susceptibility to chemical degradation
during weathering is a notable reason to investigate more highly weatherable
substitutes that offer excellent corrosion protection at a lower ultimate
cost to society.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Applied Coatings
Preparation of bronze
and vinyl substrates is detailed elsewhere.5 Base coat primers were resin-dissolved in solvent [Paraloid B-44
resin, principally composed of poly(methyl methacrylate-co-ethyl acrylate), in 20% (w/w) toluene, Dow, Inc.]. The top coat
used was waterborne Kynar Aquatec FMA-12 latex [50:50, PVDF and poly(methyl
methacrylate) blend, Arkema, Inc.]. Substrates (bronze and vinyl)
were spray-coated with a Fuji HVLP Super 4 XPC for a dry film thickness
of approximately 10–15 μm for each layer (i.e., primer
base coats or PVDF top coat) for a total dry film thickness of approximately
30 μm. Coatings were annealed in an oven for 6 h at 60 °C.
Accelerated weathering was performed according to ASTM G154 Cycle
B: 4 h of UV-B exposure (60 °C, Ee = 0.71) and 4 h of condensation (50 °C, recirculating distilled
water). For whitening and mass uptake values, films on vinyl were
soaked in distilled water and analyzed at 4 and 72 h, with three trials
of each coating type. Coating masses were taken as the average of
three measurements (N = 3, M = 3),
and for grayscale measurements, the films were illuminated for imaging
according to ASTM D1729-96. Images were taken using a Nikon D40 camera
and converted to grayscale in Adobe Photoshop CC, where the average k value (N = 3, M = 9)
of the chart was obtained. Gloss and thickness measurements were acquired
as an average of five trials using a Gardco μ-Tri-Gloss meter.

2.2 Preparation of Nanoclays
Laponite
RD and S482 (Southern Clay Products, Inc.) and silylating agents 3-acetoxypropyltrimethoxysilane
(APTMS, Gelest, Inc.) and (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)
triethoxysilane (FOTES, Gelest, Inc.) were used as supplied. To obtain
covalently modified clays, toluene was distilled directly into a flask
containing Laponite RD (1 g nanoclay/100 mL solvent) under anhydrous
conditions in a closed system (δ+ N2 flow).
After 30 min of heating with stirring at 35 °C, the silane was
added to the toluene clay mixture (1 mmol/g clay), and the contents
in the flask were left to stir for an additional 4 h at the same temperature.
The covalently modified Laponite was isolated for diffraction analysis
by vacuum filtration with a 0.2 μm nylon membrane, washed extensively
with toluene and then dioxane, and dried for 12 h at 65 °C. The
aqueous dispersions of the modified clay [Laponite–APTMS (LA)
or Laponite–FOTES (LF)] were obtained by quenching the grafting
reaction with 50 mL of water and isolating the water-stable nanoclay
by liquid–liquid extraction in a separatory funnel. For cation
exchange, aqueous dispersions of LA and LF were diluted to 100 mL
and heated to 50 °C after which 1 equiv (CECLaponite = 0.75 mmol/g clay) of phosphocholine chloride calcium salt tetrahydrate
was added and stirred for 12 h. The exchanged/grafted clay Laponite-APTMS-phosphoryl
choline (LAPc) or Laponite-FOTES-phosphoryl choline (LFPc) was vacuum
filtered, washed with cold ethanol, and immediately redispersed in
DI water. Aqueous dispersions (2.6% w/w) of clays of LAPc, LFPc, or
Laponite S482 (LNa: unmodified sodic Laponite blended with peptizing
agent tetrasodium pyrophosphate) were added with high shear to freshly
prepared PVDF latex immediately after the preparation, and no aging/gelation
of the clay was observed at the time of incorporation.

2.3 Surface Characterization
Zeta potentials
were measured on filtered aqueous clay dispersions using a Malvern
Zetasizer Nano and disposable plastic cells. Thermogravimetric measurements
were acquired in platinum crucibles at a scanning rate of 20 °C/min
from 50 to −750 °C using a PerkinElmer TGA7.

All
X-ray studies were acquired using a Rigaku Ultima IV Multipurpose
X-ray diffractometer with a Cu kα radiation source (λ
= 1.542 Å) and step size = 0.002° for 12 s. Powder samples
were ground finely using an agate mortar and pestle and pressed into
a random orientation on a mirrored slide. Thin film spectra with or
without a 0.5° grazing angle were acquired in situ after alignment
of the sample in the x, y, and z directions. XPS measurements were performed on vacuum
dried clays using a Phi VersaProbe II with an Al Kα anode (10
μm spot size) and MultiPak software.

ATR-FTIR spectra
were acquired using a Nicolet
Continuμm FTIR microscope with a ThermoScientific iS10 infrared
spectrometer and a 50 μm MCT detector (4 cm–1 resolution) operated with Omnic. Spectra were acquired using a diamond
ATR objective to enable in situ analysis of a roughly circular area
with a 250 μm diameter. Data were transformed using an N–B
strong apodization function and Mertz phase correction. Raman spectra
were measured with a Horiba LabRam microscope using a 532 nm diode
laser (22 mW), 50× objective (200 μm confocal hole), 1800
g/mm grating, and LabSpec six software. Cross sections for maps were
sliced with a scalpel, mounted on a carbon tape, and mapped in a 5 ×
15 array with a 633 nm diode laser (16 mW).

2.4 Electrochemical
Characterization
A working electrode area of 14.6 cm2 was saturated with
an electrolyte (3% NaCl) for EIS analysis using a Gamry Reference
600 Potentiostat from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz with AC voltage 20 mV rms and
DC voltage 0.0 V versus open circuit potential (0 ± 200 mV).
EEC models were fit to area-normalized spectra with ZView to extract
values of individual circuit elements at each time point. Errors in
fit EEC models to the data were calculated as the sum of the residual
error where the fit differed from the experimental data. Capacitance
values (Ct) during the
immersion at time (t) for diffusion analysis were
calculated at 10 kHz according to eq 1: 1  where ω is the radial
frequency and Zi is the imaginary component
of the impedance.
The rate of diffusion (D) through the coatings by
the most mobile species (water) was determined by fitting the linear
portion of the relative uptake profiles to eq 2: 2  where C0 is the
capacitance of the film before the electrolyte immersion found by
extrapolation to t = 0 s, Cs is the saturated capacitance of the film, L is the thickness of the coating, and t1/2 is the square root of the immersion time.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Effects of Surface Modification
on Nanoclay
Stability
Covalent modification of Laponite with APTMS or
FOTES silanes occurs via a reaction between the hydroxyl groups on
the edge of the clay sheet and a silane bond to produce covalent siloxane
bonds, as illustrated by the products shown in Figure 1B. Initial grafting reactions produced organophilic
nanoclays that were not stable in water. To promote the exfoliated
state (aqueous isotropic), ionic exchange with Pc tetrahydrate was
carried out to create covalently modified and cation-exchanged nanoclays,
abbreviated as LAPc and LFPc. In addition to surface coverage and
grafting efficiency, the presence of chemical modifiers at each step
of modification was initially confirmed by ATR-FTIR35 and then investigated by XPS, WAXD, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy;
a summary of these data is presented in Table S1 and sections 1–3 of the
Supporting Information (SI).

Having hydrophilic nanoclays is
important to prevent flocculation or gelation upon addition to the
aqueous latex coating dispersion. Both the polar tail of Pc and the
occasional exchange of monovalent sodium for a divalent calcium counterion
can increase the hydration sphere and water sorption of the nanoclay
particles. Characteristic Raman peaks of the layered silicates are
shown in Figure 2 and
include a number of O–H stretches from metal–hydroxyl
complexes as well as water adsorbed in various conformations: 3710–15
cm–1 (Mg/Li–OH), 3688 cm–1 (Si–OH), 3620 cm–1 (inner sheet M–OH),
3425 cm–1 (amorphous H–OH, bulk water), and
3200 cm–1 (in-phase H–OH with crystalline
structure). Hydrophilicity was determined by the intensity ratio of
the Raman shift of bulk water (at 3450 cm–1) to
the silicon oxide lattice of the nanoclay (Si-O4 at 683
cm–1, shown in Figure S1).36 The hydroxyl stretching bands shown
in Figure 2 indicate
that the largest hydrophilicity ratio was observed for the unmodified
clay . Bulk water was reduced significantly upon
modification with organosilane and subsequently increased after the
cation exchange (LA = 0.18 to LAPc = 0.29 and LF = 0.12 to LFPc =
0.19).
Similar trends were observed by TGA where the unmodified clay LNa
had twice as much total water adsorbed by mass than that of LA or
LF (Figure S3). The higher water content
in the Pc-exchanged clays is consistent with having successfully transitioned
the covalently modified nanoclays from organophilic to hydrophilic
after the cation exchange.

Figure 2 Raman spectra of the hydroxyl and aliphatic
regions of unmodified
and functionalized nanoclays, normalized to the Si-O4 band
at 683 cm–1. There are typically 1.4 water molecules
coordinated to each Na+ and 4.4 water molecules coordinated
to each Ca2+ (the counterion for Pc used in the cation
exchange). There are two hydroxyl binding sites in the clay crystal
structure, M–OH denotes inner sheet hydroxyls attached to a
silicon (Si–OH) or magnesium (Mg–OH). The vibrations
of external hydroxyls are at higher frequencies as labeled.

Clays are considered to be stable
(i.e., unlikely to flocculate)
in dilute dispersions that have zeta potentials, ζ, more negative
than −30 mV.37 Unmodified LNa had
a ζ = −42.9 mV when dispersed in water at neutral pH.
The grafted/exchanged clays had slightly increased potentials of approximately
−38 mV for both LAPc and LFPc. We have previously used small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) when formulating the latex-clay suspensions
to ensure adequate exfoliation in both aqueous solutions and the polymer
latex suspension.35 In that work, it was
noted that cation-exchanged clays (LAPc and LFPc) were stable in water,
whereas those that had not been exchanged (LA and LF) were not stable
in water without the addition of a peptizing agent. From these combined
data, we demonstrate that such modifications to clays can result in
aqueous stable dispersions.

3.2 Barrier Properties of Waterborne
PVDF–Clay
Nanocomposites
3.2.1 Mass Transport of Fresh
and Annealed Coatings
The grayscale values of fresh and annealed
PNC films on a black
substrate measured after water-soaking for 4 and 72 hours are shown
in Figure 3, where
black = 0% for a transparent film and white = 100% for a completely
opaque film. After soaking for 4 h, the values were similar across
films. However, sustained soaking for 72 h showed that water whitening
was decreased by 50–65% for films with modified nanoclays compared
with those without soaking. These data suggest that the numbers and/or
volumes of light-scattering voids present in the final films were
reduced by adding modified nanoclays LAPc and LFPc into the wet suspensions
but not unmodified LNa.

Figure 3 Whitening of the fresh (F) or annealed (A) films
on black reference
substrates after soaking in the electrolyte for 4 and 72 h. The initial
grayscale values of all films were approximately 8%.

Permeability tests of the fresh (dry but not weathered)
films were
conducted by allowing each coated substrate to soak in the electrolyte
until saturation, and the capacitance was monitored as an impedance
measurement at 10 kHz, using the imaginary part of the impedance as
the capacitance. Relative capacitance (C/C0) of annealed films versus √t is plotted in Figure 4. The traces showed that diffusion through the films
occurred in two stages: initial linear uptake and then a slow percolation
until the films became saturated. The initial uptake profiles (35–200
s1/2) of annealed PVDF and PVDF + LNa are considered to
be type II Fickian diffusion, meaning that the pores are large enough
that they do not restrict the movement of ions. In contrast, the decreased
slopes of the films with LFPc and LAPc are indicative of a material
having a more constrained diffusion profile than for the other two
films. The diffusivity of each coating to water can be quantified
by the time it takes to saturate a film and the magnitude of the films’
capacitance.26−29 The diffusion coefficients of water  through the fresh and annealed films are
listed in Table 1.
The fresh PVDF coating with the unmodified clay LNa had the freest
ion transport, 5 × 10–9 cm2/s, and
developed visible pores on the coating surface upon extended soaking
times. Fresh coatings with LAPc and LFPc had diffusion rates that
were approximately 6 times slower than for fresh LNa- and PVDF-only
films. In annealed films, the incorporation of LFPc into the PVDF
coating halved its diffusion coefficient. The relatively free diffusion
observed in the LNa composite film compared to the film without clay
suggests that the high surface energy of the clay resulted in aggregation
in voids at the surface that are large enough to scatter light,38 decreasing the film whitening (as voids would
be filled with the clay) and increasing the mass uptake (as the unmodified
clays are highly charged). For comparison, diffusion through the best
performing film (LFPc) was larger than that of the industry-standard
solvent-borne acrylic coating by only a factor of 1.8. Calculations
have demonstrated that ion movement is restricted when pores are narrowed
to less than twice the diameter of the diffusing species.26,39,40 For water, having a diameter
of ∼0.3 nm, the size when movement becomes restricted is approximately
0.6 nm; therefore, the data suggest that any pores that exist in the
LAPc and LFPc films are approximately 0.6 nm or smaller.

of the two films. (b) Mass uptake percentage of various annealed coatings

Having
gained an understanding of the presence of light-scattering
voids and permeability profiles of the composite films, the entire
water content within the soaked films was measured by mass uptake
studies. The data shown in Figure 4b reveal that there is a much larger mass increase
for the annealed films of PVDF and PVDF + LNa than for those with
modified nanoclays after soaking for both 4 and 72 h. Aside from having
higher surface energy and clay-filled voids, LNa films absorbed significantly
more water than the other nanocomposite films may be because of a
nonreversible expansion of the mineral structure of LNa upon heating
(annealing) or soaking,41 which is a response
that should be reduced after the cation exchange (i.e., as in LAPc
and LFPc).
It is also possible that unmodified nanoclays are more easily washed
out during soaking, resulting in the production of voids formerly
occupied by the clays.

It is likely that films containing modified
nanoclays showed improved
barrier properties for two reasons. First, the nanoclay itself provided
a tortuous pathway for water. Second, the covalently linked molecules
have similar chemistry as the polymer (with APTMS being similar to
the acrylic portion and FOTES being similar to the PVDF portion),
reducing the surface energy difference between the polymer and clay
and encouraging the formation of an interpenetrating network in the
composite, rather than clay aggregation in the interstitial voids.
From the very small increase in the whiteness value observed after
72 h compared with 4 h soaking times of the modified composite films,
the data also suggest that annealing after application is not necessary
for those films contrary to previous results for this latex binder.5 Although a significant reduction in mass transport
was shown in modified composite films, remaining questions include
differentiating the effectiveness of the acrylic versus the perfluoroalkyl-modified
clays in corrosion prevention and evaluating the long-term performance
profiles of the composite films.

3.2.2 Impedance
and Circuit Values as Metrics
of Protective Quality during Weathering
To address these
questions, weathering of the films with characterization by EIS was
carried out to gain greater insight into the transport of electrolytes
through the films over time. Aggressive weathering conditions were
used to determine if either chemical-modification scheme provided
a significant improvement in long-term performance.

Total impedance
at low frequencies (|Z|0.1 Hz) is
usually dominated by the coating resistance (Rcoat) or charge transfer (Rct)
resistance when the |Z| is large. Decreases in the
value of the impedance at 0.1 Hz are correlated with decreases in
film barrier properties, where 10 MΩ is the minimum acceptable
value of protective films42 (or in our
cell setup, 146 MΩ·cm2). Impedance values for
the nanocomposite and control films are listed in Table 1 and plotted for more than 4500
h of weathering in Figure 5. Low-frequency impedance increased for all films upon QUV
weathering, likely because of annealing and other film morphological/chemical
changes, before it decreased from its maximum value after 1500 h of
exposure. By this metric, the LFPc film was the best protective coating
as it retained a high initial impedance of 4210 MΩ·cm2 at 0.1 Hz during weathering with a final value of 2390 MΩ·cm2 after weathering (−43%). The nanoclay-free PVDF control
film was the least protective with an initial impedance of 536 MΩ·cm2 and the most drastic decrease to 34.8 MΩ·cm2 (−93%), below the minimum acceptable value. The film
with added LNa had an initial impedance of 2910 MΩ·cm2, which showed improvement over PVDF without the nanoclay
and retained overall barrier properties during weathering. Although
a final impedance of 417 MΩ·cm2, a decrease
of −86% approached the minimum protective impedance value for
coatings. The coating with LAPc showed a similar performance to LFPc
films with a high initial impedance of 3490 MΩ·cm2 and a relatively small (−53%) decrease in barrier properties
yielding a final impedance of 1530 MΩ·cm2. As
predicted by the small mass transport values, this EIS data shows
that coatings with chemically modified nanoclays retained their protective
qualities the most during weathering.

without nanoclays. Plots

than 4500 h of QUV-B weathering, where the asterisk (*) marks the
transition to a more complex EEC, when percolation through the top
layer of the coating became measurable. Coating resistance (b) and
capacitance (c) are plotted using the “Before Weathering”
model in (d) until 3000 h for PVDF and 4000 h for PVDF + LNa; thereafter,
the “Failure after Weathering” model in (d) was used.
Dashed vertical lines in (b) mark the time point when corrosion on
the substrate became visible as small circular brownish dots on the
samples.

It is also useful to consider
changes in key EEC elements compared
with their initial values over time. From model-fit values of the
pore resistance and coating capacitance in Figure 5b,c, a similar trend to impedance values
is observed and is discussed in more detail in section 4 of the SI. The polymer-only film showed the smallest
relative pore resistance and largest relative coating capacitance,
whereas the polymer with added LFPc showed the largest relative pore
resistance and smallest relative coating capacitance. With the exception
of the LFPc film, small spots of corrosion appeared on the other coated
substrates at the indicated time points (dashed lines) in Figure 5b. Notably, the LNa
film showed corrosion at the earliest time point (1500 h), possibly
because of the loss of the clay from that film. In addition, each
increase in the impedance of the LNa film (2000 and 3500 h) was accompanied
by an increase in Rct, which indicated
that growth of a passivating layer of corrosion was filling in pores.
Similar observations were made for LAPc at a much longer exposure
time of 4500 h. Small layers of corrosion at the bottom of pore channels
offered limited protection, as their resistance was eventually overcome
during soaking studies. By all of these EIS measures, LFPc was the
only coating that did not develop visible corrosion and had a significantly
better performance than the other films during accelerated weathering.

Another measure of a film’s ability to prevent corrosion
is the time constant (Tcoat = CcoatRpore), which
is discussed for each film in section 4.1.3 of the SI. Both initially and throughout weathering, the resin-only
control film performed the poorest with respect to each circuit element
and had the lowest overall barrier properties. Addition of any clay increased the time constant to 5–45 times
that of the polymer-only coating.

3.2.3 Electrochemical
Stress Index Changes after
Weathering
Using maximum and minimum values from the time-course
EIS spectra of key elements in the EEC in Figure 5d, mechanical stress within a film can be
estimated by an electrochemical stress (ES) index43 shown in eq 3: 3  In this calculation, a resulting
value close to zero indicates low stress, whereas a value of 3 is
the theoretical maximum. By this metric, the PVDF resin (control film
without the nanoclay) had an ES = 2.66 after 4500 h of weathering,
which was the highest stress index in the study and makes this coating
the least weatherable. Incorporation of the nanoclay had positive
effects on reducing the stress index of the material: the unmodified
clay LNa had an ES = 1.48 and films with modified clays showed even
smaller changes where ES = 0.993 for LAPc and ES = 0.987 for LFPc.
From these data, incorporation of nanoclays reduces the stress index
of this PVDF coating, while the magnitude of that change was dependent
on the chemical modification of the nanoclay.

3.3 Photochemical Changes of Nanoclay Composites
during Weathering
The data presented thus far showed that
addition of chemically modified nanoclays significantly improves the
short- and long-term barrier properties of an already highly weatherable
coating. In an ATR-FTIR study, we observed that acrylic side groups
from the polymer were lost with weathering, as shown by the subtraction
spectra of PVDF/acrylic films in Figure 6, and that the losses were not equal across
all films. It is useful to note that many of the degradation products
of acrylic polymers are volatile and thus are not detected, especially
near the surface. In the IR subtraction spectra, each negative peak
is associated with the acrylic portion of the resin, whereas nearly
all positive peaks are attributed to the PVDF portion. Specifically,
loss of acrylic groups is readily observed by a large negative peak
at 1731 cm–1 associated with the carbonyl in the
acrylate (a functional group not present in PVDF). Additional loss
of aliphatic methyl character was observed at 2989 cm–1 (CH3 νas), 2877 cm–1 (CH3 νs), and 1472/1435 cm–1 (CH3 δas), whereas a loss of aliphatic
methylene character was observed at 2958 cm–1 (CH2 νas), 2847 cm–1 (CH2 νs), and 1450 cm–1 (CH2 δ scissor). The largest change in aliphatic groups
occurred with a negative peak at 2926 cm–1 and was
assigned as a methylene stretching band. A variety of C–F2 stretching vibrations were present from 1300 to 800 cm–1, all positive in the subtraction spectra. Large positive
peaks associated with the PVDF backbone were assigned to the CH2 scissor mode (1400 cm–1), CF2/CH2 twisting (882 cm–1), and CF2/CH2 skeletal-β twisting (840 cm–1). The increase in the PVDF vibrational modes indicates that the
component exists in greater proportions at the surface of the coating.
In fact, after 4000 h, the ATR-FTIR spectrum indicated that the surfaces
of the films without nanoclays were nearly devoid of any acrylic character
in the polymer and were nearly purely PVDF. The smallest difference
peaks were observed for the perfluoroalkyl clay composites using ATR-FTIR
spectroscopy. It has been hypothesized that smectites can act as free
radical quenchers during UV exposure,44 which could also explain the reduction in photodegradation observed
when the nanoclays were incorporated.

Figure 6 FTIR-ATR spectra of coated bronze panels
before and after 4000
h of weathering by QUV. The subtraction results were produced from
the weathered minus the initial (before weathering) spectrum and are
vertically offset by −0.1 a.u. for visual clarity.

Surface ablation of the coatings was confirmed
by thin film X-ray
diffraction (TF-XRD) (data
shown in Figure S5), where the spectra
show two important features: (1) a loss of film thickness and (2)
surface enrichment of crystalline PVDF. The film that thinned most
and showed the greatest increase in PVDF crystallinity after weathering
was the polymer-only film. TF-XRD data also showed that addition of
nanoclays reduced the film loss and changes in polymer crystallinity.
Material loss can also be monitored by relative changes in the film
thickness and gloss measurements, data for which are listed in Table 2 for each coating
after weathering by QUV. Contrary to what was predicted, addition
of the LNa clay did not appreciably affect gloss of the PVDF coating
before or after weathering but slightly prevented the film loss over
time. LFPc films had the lowest initial gloss compared with all of
the other films (having a more matte appearance is often considered
to be an aesthetic improvement for coatings, to reduce glare). LFPc
films also showed the least change in gloss and the smallest change
in the film thickness (<30%) after weathering. Because the chemical
functionality of the APTMS silane is more similar to that of the ester
pendant groups in the acrylic resin, modified LAPc clays may be more
susceptible to chemical degradation than clays of LFPc. If LAPc loses
chemical functionality, the clay could be washed out from the coating
matrix, resulting in a loss of the film due to the loss of radical
quenchers in the clay.

and after 4000 h QUV-B

PVDF	12.6 ± 1.1	–33.3 ± 2.9	–36.5 ± 9.8	
PVDF + LNa	12.6 ± 0.3	–35.7 ± 0.96	–29.4 ± 8.5

Structural changes in the polymer that result in an
increase in
the crystallinity should give rise to a film that has excellent barrier
properties. It has been observed in the literature that irradiation
is capable of inducing conformational changes in semicrystalline fluoropolymers.45,46 On the basis of our ATR-FTIR data, the percentage of PVDF at the
surface increased to near purity during weathering, and on the basis
of TF-XRD data, the films became more crystalline. The EIS stability
of particularly the LFPc film during weathering suggests that the
films weather in two phases: (1) microcrystalline PVDF-enriched domains
and (2) nanocrystalline-modified clays, with both phases having electrolyte/corrosive
impenetrable crystalline domains. It is also likely that the nanoclays
might (1) as suggested by others44 both
absorb and scatter incoming UV radiation, thus minimizing the amount
penetrating the coating, and (2) reduce photodegradation-induced mass
transport out of the film. Raman microscopy was used to investigate
these claims and produce cross-section maps of a polymer-only film
and a polymer + LNa film after weathering, both of which are shown
in Figure 7. The polymer-only
film showed a higher intensity (concentration) and a thicker enriched
layer of PVDF in the film (or, conversely, the acrylic-depleted layer
was thicker) compared with the nanocomposite film after weathering
for 4500 h. The acrylic base coat was significantly degraded and embrittled
when a polymer-only top coat was used as can be observed by the cracks
in the lower portion of the cross section in Figure 7c and by the accompanying heat map of the
ratio of key PVDF/acrylic Raman peaks.

Figure 7 Raman spectra before
weathering of the PVDF/acrylic top coat (a)
and acrylic PMMA/PEA primer coat (b) normalized to the band at 602
cm–1 (δ C–C). Cross sections of weathered
PVDF (c) and PVDF + LNa (f) were mapped by Raman spectroscopy, and
the intensity ratios of key PVDF/acrylic stretching bands are plotted
(I885/I1730) in (e) and (h). For comparison, the Raman maps were superimposed
over white light images in (d) and (g). After normalization, the maximum
intensity ratio was 3.0 and the minimum was 0.5. Measured intensities
were smoothed in both x and y directions
to create a cohesive map; the blue fringes at the top and bottom are
artifacts of smoothing to zero.

4 Conclusions
We have demonstrated that by incorporating chemically modified
nanoclays, the barrier properties of films produced from aqueous dispersions
of acrylic/PVDF lattices can be significantly improved over both the
short and long term. XPS and Raman data showed that (1) Laponite clay
was covalently modified with FOTES and cation exchanged with Pc; (2)
grafting efficiency was more than 100%, suggesting that each accessible
hydroxyl along the clay rim was covalently bound to one FOTES molecule;
(3) approximately more than 50% silanes remaining after washing were
covalently cross-linked to other FOTES molecules; and (4) cation exchange
with Pc increased the hydrophilicity of the covalently modified clay.
Covalently modified nanoclay particles were dispersible in aqueous
colloidal suspensions of a highly weatherable resin and with a much
smaller loading weight (0.6% of a dry film) than other studies have
reported.10,11,21

The
weathering performance of the nanocomposite films was better
in every measured parameter than in the films without the clay. All
composite films studied retained their high-performance barrier properties,
as measured by EIS and the stress index, after a substantial loss
of acrylic functionality near the surface and a loss of 10–40%
of the film thickness. However, the performance characteristics of
each differed considerably. Although the PVDF/acrylic waterborne resin
is an exceptional barrier top coat with long-term weatherability,
its performance can be substantially improved by the inclusion of chemically compatible nanoclays.

What accounts for
the better EIS barrier performance of LFPc compared
with LAPc composite films during weathering? It seems likely that
the interaction between the polymer resin and the organofunctionalized
clays may play a substantial role. The latex polymer used in these
studies was synthesized in a core–shell synthesis, with the
core and the shell having both acrylic and PVDF components but in
differing amounts.2,3 To enable dispersion in aqueous
media, the shell has a greater percentage of acrylic (hydrophilic)
than the core does. Given that the best barrier properties were observed
in films with added LFPc, it is possible that the LFPc clays facilitate
the formation of an interpenetrating polymer network better than those
with LAPc.

Good stability (both chemical and mechanical) was
observed by the
low stress index of chemically modified clays in the PVDF/acrylic
films. The LNa and LFPc clays had the highest degree of exfoliation
and the longest time constants for much of the weathering time. However,
the unmodified LNa composite film had a lower film resistance and
higher coating capacitance than the LFPc composite film. One explanation
for the LNa composite film’s diminished barrier properties
despite having a longer time constant may arise from the microstructural
arrangement of the clays in the interstitial spaces of the wet resin
during the film formation. Evidence suggests that although LNa was
exfoliated completely in water, there was little chemical compatibility
with the latex particles in the film, which can disrupt coalescence
of latex particles during drying. The result would be larger voids
between latex particles where migrating ion species are retained,
as was indeed suggested by the mass-transport studies. Chemical modification
of clays resulted in particles that retained their ability to be exfoliated
and improved their dispersibility in this highly weatherable resin.
The combination of the microstructural arrangement of clay particles,
the chemical compatibility between the perfluoroalkyl-modified clays
and the PVDF portion of the resin, and the excellent weatherability
of both perfluoroalkyl and PVDF functionalities likely accounts for
the superior corrosion resistance of the LFPc composite films throughout
weathering.
