Six terphenyl-bridged cyclometalated
ruthenium–amine conjugated
complexes 4(PF6)–9(PF6) were synthesized and studied. Three different substituents,
methoxy, methyl, and chloro, were used to vary the electronic nature
of the amine unit, and two terminal ligands 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine
(tpy) and trimethyl-4,4′,4″-tricarboxylate-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine
(Me3tctpy) were used to tune the electronic nature of the
ruthenium component. All complexes, except 7(PF6) with the methoxy substituent and Me3tctpy ligand, display
two well-separated redox waves in the potential range of +0.5 to +1.1
V versus Ag/AgCl. The regular electrochemical changes of these complexes
help to establish the oxidation order of ruthenium and amine and hence
of the direction of the electron transfer in odd-electron state. The
degree of electronic coupling was estimated by analyzing the donor-to-acceptor
charge transfer band in the near-infrared region obtained by oxidative
spectroelectrochemical measurements. Electron paramagnetic resonance
analyses and density functional theory calculations were performed
on the one-electron oxidized forms to obtain information on the spin
distribution of these complexes.

Introduction
Since
the pioneering work of Creutz and Taube,1 the ground-state electron transfer (ET) between redox-active
donors and acceptors has been extensively examined in the form of
mixed-valence (MV) compounds obtained by the one-electron oxidation
or reduction of symmetric precursors.2 These
studies are of importance in providing information on the fundamental
ET processes by electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and theoretical analysis.3 The presence of multistep redox processes of
MV compounds, accompanied by distinct changes of their electronic
and optical properties, make them useful for a number of optoelectronic
applications such as electrochromism,4 molecular
switches,5 and molecular electronics.6

Bridged bisruthenium complexes7 and
bis(triarylamines)8 are representative
compounds used in MV chemistry. To date, a large number of such symmetric
molecular materials have been synthesized and examined for the fundamental
ET studies.7,8 In these compounds, there is no free energy
change (ΔG0) between the initial
and final states of the ET reaction. In contrast, MV systems with
different terminal ligands or substituents on the termini lead to
redox asymmetry and free energy change.9 The great structure diversity of redox-asymmetric systems allows
us to further modulate the degree of charge delocalization and the
energy and shape of intervalence charge transfer (IVCT).9,10

The ET properties of MV compounds are normally analyzed by
the
classical Marcus–Hush or generalized Mulliken–Hush theory.11 This method could be further expanded for the
analysis of asymmetric MV compounds and systems with completely different
chemical structures of the donor and acceptor, if certain degree of
electronic coupling is present between them and similar charge transfer
transitions could be observed in the odd-electron state.12 The charge transfer transitions in these systems
are better to be called donor-to-acceptor charge transfer (DACT) bands,
instead of IVCT bands. We recently reported that the combination of
cyclometalated ruthenium and triarylamine gives rise to appealing
materials with strong charge delocalization and multistep redox processes.13 The presence of the Ru–C bond in these
compounds ensures strong coupling between cyclometalated ruthenium
and triarylamine. As a result, intense DACT bands are observed from
these compounds in odd-electron states both in the solution and thin
films.14 One interesting question remains
in these systems is that of the direction of ET. Because cyclometalated
ruthenium and triarylamine have very similar redox potential and 
often strong coupling between them, it is sometimes difficult to determine
the direction of ET in these compounds. For compounds with a short
linker, these compounds display a large degree of charge delocalization
and it is meaningless to discuss the direction of ET. We present herein
the synthesis, characterization, and ET studies of a series of para-terphenyl-bridged cyclometalated ruthenium–amine
conjugated complexes, 4(PF6)–9(PF6), with different substituents on the amine
group and different terminal ligands on the ruthenium component (Figure 1). The moderate length
of the para-terphenyl bridge allows us to observe
distinctly different electrochemical and spectroscopic properties
by substituent effects, providing reliable information for the determination
of the ET direction of these compounds.

Results and Discussion
Complexes 4(PF6)–9(PF6) were synthesized as outlined
in Figure 1. Methoxy,
methyl, and chloro groups were
used to tune the electronic properties of the amine unit, whereas
2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (tpy) and trimethyl-4,4′,4″-tricarboxylate-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine
(Me3tctpy) were used as the terminal ligands for the ruthenium
components. Ligands 1–3 with different
amine substituents were obtained in moderate yield by the palladium-catalyzed
Suzuki coupling of 3,5-di(pyrid-2-yl)phenylboronic acid with N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-p-(bromophen-4-yl)aniline, N,N-di(4-methylphenyl)-p-(bromophen-4-yl)aniline, and N,N-di(4-chlorophenyl)-p-(bromophen-4-yl)aniline,
respectively. According to the previous procedures,13,15 the reaction of 1, 2, or 3 with [Ru(tpy)Cl3] or [Ru(Me3tctpy)Cl3] with the aid of AgOTf, followed by anion exchange using KPF6, gave 4(PF6)–9(PF6). The yields of these reactions are moderate, ranging
from 49 to 74%. The synthesis and characterization of ligand 1 and compound 4(PF6) have been reported
by us recently.13b Other complexes have
been fully characterized by different analytical techniques, as given
in the Experimental Section. In addition,
two cyclometalated ruthenium complexes, 10(PF6) and 11(PF6), without the amine site were
used in the current study for the purpose of comparison (Figure 1).13a

The electronic properties of the previously mentioned
materials
were first examined by electrochemical analysis (Figure 2 and Table 1). In the anodic cyclic voltammetry (CV)
scan, ligand 1–3 all show one redox
wave at +0.73, +0.89, and +1.10 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively, attributing
to the amine oxidation process (the N•+/0 process).
The redox potential of the ligand shifts to the more positive region
as the substituent becomes more electron-deficient from OMe to Me
and Cl (Figure 2a).
The RuIII/II potential of the Me3tctpy-containing
model complex 11(PF6) (+0.74 V) is comparable
to the N•+/0 potential of 1. The RuIII/II process of the tpy-containing model complex 10(PF6) has the least positive potential (+0.56 V) among
these five compounds. This trend is also evident from the differential
pulse voltammograms (DPVs) as displayed in Figure 2d.

by subtracting 0.45 V. The ΔEp value
in the parenthesis stands for the peak-to-peak potential separation
of each redox couple. The relatively large ΔEp values are possibly caused by slow ET kinetics.

in the anodic region.

c Kc =
10ΔE(mV)/59.

Complexes 4(PF6)–6(PF6) possess the same tpy
ligand on the ruthenium component.
They differ only in the substituents of the amine site. Two well-separated
redox waves are observed for these compounds in the range of +0.5
to +1.1 V (Figure 2b,e). The first, less positive, redox wave of 4(PF6)–6(PF6) did not vary significantly,
locating at +0.58, +0.61, and +0.61 V, respectively. The potential
of this wave is comparable, yet slightly more positive, with respect
to the RuIII/II potential of the tpy-containing model ruthenium
complex 10(PF6) (+0.56 V). In contrast, their
second wave gradually shifted from +0.72 V for 4(PF6) to +0.88 and +1.10 V, for 5(PF6)
and 6(PF6), respectively. This positive-shift
trend is consistent with that of the N•+/0 potential
change of ligand 1–3. Indeed, the
potential of the second wave of 4(PF6)–6(PF6) is almost the same as the N•+/0 potential of ligand 1–3, respectively.
Based on these data, we can safely infer that the first redox wave
of these compounds is largely associated with the RuIII/II process, whereas the second one with the N•+/0 process.

Complex 7(PF6) displays an
unresolved two-electron
redox peak at +0.73 V. This is reasonable considering the corresponding
ligand 1 and the model ruthenium complex 11(PF6) possess a very similar redox peak at almost the
same potential. In contrast, complexes 8(PF6) and 9(PF6) show the presence of two well-separated
waves (Figure 2c,f).
This series of complexes share the same electron-deficient Me3tctpy auxiliary ligand on the ruthenium component and differ
in the substituent on the amine site. Again, the potential of their
first redox wave is comparable to the RuIII/II potential
of the Me3tctpy-containing model ruthenium complex 11(PF6) (+0.74 V) and their second wave change
in an ascending order from 7(PF6) (the second
wave overlaps with the first one) to 9(PF6). This leads to the same conclusion that the oxidation of the ruthenium
component of this series [particularly for 8(PF6) and 9(PF6)] occurs before the amine oxidation.

The potential splitting ΔE between the two
anodic redox waves of 4(PF6)–9(PF6) varies in the range of 140–490 mV.
Note that redox asymmetry, or the ET free energy change ΔG0, is largely responsible for the potential
splitting of these weakly-coupled complexes. Compound 6(PF6) has the largest redox asymmetry, and it also has
the largest potential splitting. The comproportionation constants, Kc, of these complexes were determined by Kc = 10ΔE(mV)/59, which reflects the relative thermodynamic stability in the one-electron-oxidized
state.

To probe the degree of electronic coupling of the previously
mentioned
complexes, they were examined by stepwise oxidative spectroelectrochemistry. Figure 3 shows the visible
(vis) and near-infrared (NIR) absorption spectral changes of ligands 1–3 on oxidation. Intensive absorption
bands between 600 and 1000 nm, assigned to the ammonium radical cation
(N•+) localized transitions,8,16 appeared
on amine oxidation. The main absorption band slightly shifts to the
low-energy region when the amine becomes more electron-deficient from 1 to 3.

Figure 3 Vis/NIR absorption spectral changes of ligand
(a) 1, (b) 2, and (c) 3 on
stepwise oxidative
electrolysis in 0.1 M nBu4NClO4/CH3CN. The applied potential was referenced vs
Ag/AgCl.

On stepwise oxidations, two distinct
vis/NIR spectral changes were
observed for 4(PF6)–9(PF6) (Figures 4 and 5). For instance, when the applied potential
was increased stepwise from +0.50 to +0.75 V versus Ag/AgCl in the
single-oxidation step, a broad NIR band with an absorption maximum
(λmax) at around 1300 nm appeared (Figure 4a). In accordance with the
previously mentioned assignment of ruthenium oxidation in the first
step, the metal-to-ligand charge transfer transition at around 500
nm significantly decreased. When we further increased the potential
to +1.0 V in the double-oxidation step, the NIR absorptions decreased
gradually. Meanwhile, a new intense absorption band between 600 and
1000 nm appeared (Figure 4b). This experiment suggests that the broad NIR absorption
in the odd-electron state belongs to the DACT band. The composition
of the intense band observed in the double-oxidation step could be
complicated, including the ligand-to-metal charge transfer, N•+-localized transitions, and the bridge-involved charge
transfer transitions. Similar two-step vis/NIR spectral changes were
observed for 5(PF6) (Figure 4c,d) and 8(PF6) (Figure 5c,d) with the appearance
of a broad DACT band in the NIR region.

For complex 6(PF6), an
absorption band
with a λmax at around 1000 nm appeared in the single
oxidation step (Figure 4e). However, during the double-oxidation step, this band did not
decrease. Instead, intense absorptions with λmax at
around 820 and 1110 nm showed up at exactly the same wavelength region
(Figure 4f). We have
no solid evidence at this stage to assign the absorption band at 1000
nm of 62+ to the DACT transition. For a complex
with a large redox asymmetry and weak coupling, bridge-involved charge
transfer transitions could also be observed in the odd-electron state.
Complex 9(PF6) has the same situation (Figure 5e,f). The absorption
band at 1000 nm observed for 92+ could not
be assigned to the DACT transition at this stage.

Although the
oxidations of the ruthenium component and the amine
unit of 7(PF6) occur at a very similar potential,
a weak and broad DACT band in the NIR region can still be observed
during the stepwise oxidation, which increases at the initial oxidation
stage and decreases at the second oxidation stage (Figure 5a,b). Considering the similar
oxidation potential of the two redox termini, we did not intend to
assign the direction of ET of this complex.

The previously mentioned
spectroelectrochemical measurements showed
that a distinct DACT band was observed for 42+, 52+, 72+, and 82+. This band was further fitted by Gaussian functions
as demonstrated in Figure 6. Corresponding DACT parameters are summarized in Table 2. The classical Hush
formula, Vab = 0.0206 × (εmaxυ̃maxΔυ̃1/2)1/2/(Rab),11 was used to estimate the degree of electronic coupling Vab. In this equation, εmax,
υ̃max, and Δυ̃1/2 stand for the molar absorption coefficient, wavenumbers of the absorption
maximum in cm–1, and the full width at half height
in cm–1, respectively. The ET distance Rab was taken to be 14.83 Å for all complexes from
the calculated Ru–N geometrical distance. As can be seen from Table 2, these complexes
have similar degree of electronic coupling. The Vab value is around a few hundreds of wavenumbers. The
relatively smaller value of 72+ could be partially
caused by the underestimation of εmax recorded during
the spectroelectrochemical measurements. The observed DACT band possibly
did not reach its maximum because of the overlapping N•+/0 and RuIII/II potentials in this complex. As the DACT
band of 62+ and 92+ has not been established in the current study, the degree of coupling
of these two complexes is not further discussed.

The above experimental data suggested
that the ruthenium component
of the previously mentioned complexes, except 7(PF6), was oxidized before the amine oxidation. We intended to
perform the EPR analysis to get some information on the spin distribution
of the one-electron oxidized samples. These samples were obtained
by oxidation of 4(PF6)–9(PF6) with 0.5 equiv of cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN)
in CH3CN. Surprisingly, only 42+ and 72+ show well-defined EPR signals (Figure 7). No distinct EPR
signals were observed from the other four samples under the same measurement
conditions. Complex 42+ displays a broad EPR
signal with the g value of 2.175. The previous interpretation
of this signal as an aminum radical cation could be inappropriate.13b This peak is more likely attributed to a ruthenium(III)-biased
species. In contrast, we observed a sharp EPR peak with the g value of 2.00 from 72+. The assignment
of this sharp peak to an aminum radical cation is reasonable. Because
of the overlapping N•+/0 and RuIII/II potentials in this complex, the ruthenium and amine oxidations are
expected to occur simultaneously with the addition of CAN and the
obtained sample 72+ contains both aminum radical
cation and ruthenium(III) species.

K. The samples were obtained
by oxidation of 4(PF6) and 7(PF6) with 0.5 equiv CAN.

In many MV and related studies, density functional theory
(DFT)
calculations have been proven useful in predicting the spin distributions
of molecular materials in different redox states.17 In the beginning, we performed the DFT calculations of
the one-electron oxidized forms 42+–92+ with the commonly used UB3LYP hybrid functional.18 The spin density distributions are displayed
in the left column of Figure 8. Complexes 42+, 72+, and 82+ show triarylamine-localized
spin density distributions and those of 52+ and 92+ are delocalized across the molecule.
Only complex 62+ is predicted to have ruthenium-localized
spin density distribution. These results have some discrepancy with
the previously mentioned experimental data, which suggested that the
spin of all complexes, except 72+, should
be localized on the ruthenium component.

Figure 8 DFT-calculated spin density
distribution of 42+–92+ using UB3LYP (left column)
or CAM-UB3LYP (right column) functional.

To improve the calculation results, we tried to perform the
DFT
calculations with the long-range-corrected CAM-UB3LYP functional.19 The spin density distributions obtained with
CAM-UB3LYP are displayed in the right column of Figure 8, which shows some improvements with respect
to those with UB3LYP. The tpy-series complexes 42+–62+ are all predicted to
have ruthenium-localized spin density distribution, in agreement with
the experimental data. However, the Me3tctpy-containing
complexes 72+–92+ are still not satisfactory. In particular, complex 82+ still shows wrong information with triarylamine-localized
spin density distribution, reflecting the limitation of DFT calculations
in predicting the electronic structures of these complexes.

Conclusions
In conclusion, six terphenyl-bridged cyclometalated ruthenium–amine
conjugated complexes were synthesized. The variation of the electronic
nature of the amine substituents and the terminal ligand of the ruthenium
component led to regular changes of the redox potentials and potential
splitting. This result, together with the spectroelectrochemical analysis,
helps to establish the oxidation order of the ruthenium component
and amine unit in individual complexes. This in turn determines the
direction of the ET in the odd-electron state of these complexes.
EPR data and DFT calculations provide some complementary information
on the electronic structures of these complexes. However, care needs
to be taken to interpret these data. Work is under way to search for
more reliable calculation methods and functionals to predict the electronic
structures of these organic–inorganic conjugated complexes.
