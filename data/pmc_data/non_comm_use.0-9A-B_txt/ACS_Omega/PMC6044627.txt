The use of particulate titanium dioxide
(TiO2) as an
active sunscreen ingredient has raised concerns about potential risks
from TiO2-mediated free radical formation. To date, remediation
attempts have concentrated on reducing the yield of free radical generation
by TiO2 upon sunlight exposure. The problem with this approach
is that given the band gap in TiO2, production of radical
and the ensuing reactive oxygen species (ROS) is completely normal.
Our strategy is based on a nontoxic, biocompatible shell that neutralizes
the free radicals by scavenging them with natural antioxidants before
they exit the particle. The new lignin@TiO2 composites
preserve the scattering and absorption properties of TiO2 because the particles retain their nanoscale dimensions as preferred
by the cosmetic industry. Although the target properties for photocatalysis
and sun-protection applications are opposite, we argue that exactly
the same knowledge is required to optimize either one.

Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a common ingredient in sunscreens
where its loading is frequently 2%–15%, whereas the allowed
“loading” of this material is up to 25%, the highest
for any sunscreen ingredient. The TiO2 form mostly employed
for these applications is anatase, which is also used in a broad range
of applications such as solar cells, photocatalysis, and sterilizing
coatings because of its high reactivity.1 TiO2 activity relates to the generation of HO• and O2–• radicals along with
other reactive oxygen species (ROS), including H2O2.2,3 Given these catalytic applications, it is
hardly surprising that the use of TiO2 in sunscreens has
been tainted by reports of enzyme inactivation and potential damage
to biomolecules, to the extent that its use in sunscreens has been
described as “a societal experiment.”4 Although there are a few indications that noncoated TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs)5 do not penetrate
either healthy or damaged skin, some authors emphasize that further
studies for the safety evaluation of the TiO2 NPs in sunscreens
must be undertaken to simulate real-world conditions, particularly
in sunburned skin and under UV exposure.6 The same controversial opinions are reported in different studies
that suggest the penetration7 or not8 of zinc oxide and its dangerous disposal.9 Moreover, whether or not TiO2 penetrates
the skin, there is evidence that hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen,10 two of its products of sunlight exposure, do.
Beyond the evaluation of titania toxicity on its potential adverse
health consequences, it is clear that any strategy that reduces the
ability of TiO2 to generate and release ROS, while preserving
or enhancing its desirable properties (i.e., light absorption and
scattering), would ease some of the concerns that society as a whole
and cosmetic manufacturing in particular may have. Whereas eliminating
the reactivity of TiO2 under illumination may prove to
be quite challenging, an alternative strategy that we use here is
to scavenge ROS and other species that may be formed before they diffuse
away from TiO2 and cause damage to either biomolecules
or other important sunscreen ingredients. Our approach is different
from the usual modifications of TiO2 using SiO2 or Al2O311 or from
the known attenuation of radical generation upon encapsulation in
large-pore zeolites.12 SiO2 or
Al2O3 shells are designed to increase the energy
band gap of TiO2 to make the formation of ROS more energetic
(less favored). Here, we do not attempt to reduce the generation of
ROS through band-gap alteration but to prevent them from being released
into the surrounding media. For this purpose, we decided to look for
an antioxidant organic shell.13 We demonstrate
here that by using lignin to construct a thin shell around TiO2 particles we can achieve this goal.

Lignin is a natural,
heterogeneous, and cross-linked phenolic polymer.14 It is the second most abundant biopolymer on
earth, mainly obtained as a waste product in the wood-pulp and sugarcane
milling industries. Additionally, lignin is also environment-friendly,
biocompatible, biodegradable, and harmless for human health.15 As mentioned above, the ROS photogenerated on
the surface of TiO2 can diffuse and thus react with the
surrounding medium, either biostructures or other organic ingredients
of the sunscreen formulations.16 Recent
studies have reported that lignin is a good UV-absorbent coating17 and is able to contribute as a sunblock, protecting
organic filters from photodegradation.18

The new hybrid material developed in this work takes advantage
of the free radical scavenging and antioxidant properties of lignin,13 which is effectively used as a sacrificial scavenger
for the ROS anticipated from TiO2. An earlier publication
demonstrated that when TiO2 is embedded in a lignin matrix,
the free radical activity of TiO2 is diminished, thus providing
a good indication that the lignin matrix can be an effective scavenger
for these radicals.19 Here, we managed
to shield TiO2 NPs using a very thin shell of lignin, a
nontoxic and extremely versatile product. Thus, a thin coating, rather
than a thick matrix, can provide enough protection while TiO2 retains the nanostructured features that have made it a broadly
employed material in sun protection and cosmetics.

To evaluate
the effect of a lignin shell on TiO2 reactivity
and its use as a potential ingredient in sunscreens and cosmetics,
several types of experiments were performed. Here, we present the
synthesis and characterization methods of different lignin@TiO2 hybrids. The reduced photocatalytic activity of the modified
TiO2 particles using the photo-oxidation of 2-propanol
to acetone as a test reaction19 and the
concomitant decrease in the TiO2-mediated photodamage to
enzymes are also described. Additionally, the photoprotection of other
sunscreen active ingredients by the lignin-modified TiO2 particles is shown.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Particles
Briefly, 10 (mg) (or 100 mg)
of lignin was solubilized in 5 mL of solvent [water or tetrahydrofuran
(THF), according to the solubility properties of the corresponding
lignin] and placed together with 10 mg of TiO2. The mixture
was kept in the dark overnight and then subjected to UVA (368 nm LED)
irradiation for 2 h under vigorous stirring. The slurry was separated
by centrifugation and washed three times. The resulting particles
were dried at 100–120 °C for at least 1 h; this should
eliminate any residual THF (bp 65 °C). The particles were characterized
using attenuated total reflection—infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy,
diffuse reflectance (DR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

Photocatalytic Oxidation
of 2-Propanol
The photoactivity
of the NPs was observed using the photo-oxidation of 2-propanol to
acetone as a reference reaction as previously reported.19 The reaction was carried out at 35–38
°C under combined UVA–UVB irradiation (10 UVA lamps and
4 UVB lamps). Control experiments under dark conditions were also
performed (TiO2, lignin, and lignin@TiO2) showing
no reaction. The conversion of 2-propanol in an aqueous solution (5
mM) under stirring was evaluated in the presence of TiO2 and several lignin@TiO2 NPs. For this, 1 mL aliquots
of particles were used to reach a final concentration of 0.4 mg/mL
in 5 mL, and the sample was collected at 1 h intervals for 5 h. Each
aliquot was centrifuged at 7000 rpm, 20 °C, for 10 min, and 800
μL of the supernatant was used to record the 1H NMR
spectrum using the water suppression sequence, with the presaturation
signal centered at 4.706 ppm (proton signal of H2O) in
the presence of 3-(trimethylsilyl)-2,2,3,3-tetradeutero propionic
acid (sodium salt) (TMSP) in D2O as the external standard
to analyze the degradation of 2-propanol over irradiation time using
a calibration curve previously fitted.

Enzyme Inactivation: TiO2-Mediated Photodamage
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
from the bovine intestinal mucosa (0.02
mg/mL) solution and particle suspension (0.25 mg/mL) were prepared
in a cold buffer (1.0 M diethanolamine with 0.50 mM magnesium chloride)
of pH 9.8 at 37 °C. The substrate solution of p-nitro phenylphosphate (PNPP) was prepared in water with a concentration
of 0.5 mM. The enzyme was subjected to UVA irradiation for 30 min
in the absence and in the presence of 50 μg/mL TiO2 or lignin@TiO2 under stirring. Then, the suspensions
were centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 15 min at 0 °C. Control
reactions under dark conditions were also performed. The enzymatic
assay was performed in a 96-well plate using the following final concentrations:
[PNPP] = 25 μM and [ALP] = 1.5 μg/mL. The enzyme activity
was followed by monitoring the absorbance changes at 405 nm, where
the dephosphorylated product has a maximum absorption.

Compatibility
with Avobenzone
An avobenzone aqueous
solution (24 μM) was prepared in a 1 mM Brij-10 solution (<0.04%
2-propanol). The mixture was sonicated for 3 h and stored in the dark
overnight. The reaction was carried out using 8 mL of this solution
in a quartz test tube placed in a photoreactor equipped with 10 UVA
lamps and 4 UVB lamps under stirring. TiO2 and several
lignin@TiO2 NPs were tested using three different avobenzone/particle
ratios: 1/13, 1/41, and 1/82 (w/w). Samples (1 mL) were collected
at 1 h intervals for 4 h and centrifuged at 7000 rpm, 20 °C for
10 min. Each aliquot was analyzed using UV spectroscopy, recording
absorbance at 362 nm.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
Different types of lignin
(see Supporting Information) were used
for the synthesis of the new material, ranging from water-soluble
lignin to lignin that can only be solubilized in organic solvents
(Table 1). The particles
can be easily synthesized under very mild conditions taking advantage
of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.3 Upon UVA irradiation of a mixture of lignin solution (organic
or aqueous solution depending on the type of lignin used) in the presence
of TiO2, lignin can be cross-linked over the particle surface
(because of the light-induced ROS generation) and can lead to lignin-coated
TiO2 NPs within a couple of hours. Here, the photocatalytic
activity of TiO2 generates radical species that can cross-link
the polymeric moieties of lignin on the surface of TiO2 thanks to UV radiation as suggested by Mukherjee et al.20

Figures 1 and 2 show the functionalization of TiO2 using
L1. Similar results were found for the other types of lignin used
(Figures S1 and S2). According to the IR spectrum of TiO2, the band
at 3400 cm–1 is due to the OH stretching, whereas
at 1630 cm–1 we can observe OH bending vibrations.
Between 1000 and 400 cm–1, the broad band is related
to the Ti–O–Ti stretching bonds. On the other hand,
the characteristic peaks of lignin are at 2900 cm–1 for sp3 C–H stretching, 1600 cm–1 for C=O stretching, and below 1500 cm–1 for the aromatic ring bending. In general, all particles clearly
show signals corresponding to both TiO2 and lignin. The
DR spectra in Figure 2 show that the particles can slightly extend the absorption of TiO2 to the visible light region (normally below 400 nm) because
of the presence of lignin. Note that the thin lignin coating makes
these compositions cosmetically acceptable not only in terms of light
absorption and scattering but also in terms of the visible color and
appearance (inset of Figure 2). In fact, lignin@TiO2 NPs show a very light tint
suitable for skincare formulations. Additionally, because the particles
are insoluble in water, they are effectively waterproof.

The high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image
in Figure 3 suggests
that an organic shell surrounds the TiO2 particles and,
more importantly, that the particles retain their nanometric size
(≤50 nm). Table 2 shows the amount of lignin found on each particle using TGA. The
organosoluble lignins generate particles with higher loadings, presumably
because of the presence of more conjugated structures in those types
of lignin that can interact better with the free radicals generated
by TiO2.21 In commercial formulations,
the presence of dispersants will normally reduce aggregation.

The stability of the particles in an aqueous solution
upon UVA–UVB
irradiation was monitored using UV spectroscopy, following the absorption
at the wavelength of maximum absorption of the corresponding lignin.
Thus, the absorbance due to leached or degraded lignin can be measured
in the supernatant of the mixture after 2 h of irradiation. Figure 4 shows that the particles
exhibit great stability under UVA–UVB exposure (Figure S4). As expected, the percentage of organosoluble
lignins (L1 and L2) released was lower compared with water-soluble
lignins.

irradiation for 2 h. The plot assumes that the absorption coefficient
of lignin is constant, that is, insensitive to exposure or release.
Data reproducible within ±5%.

Photocatalytic Oxidation of 2-Propanol
We evaluated
the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 by using the well-known
oxidation of alcohols to ketones as a test reaction.3 Here, we used an established methodology19 to evaluate the inhibition of the photocatalytic activity
of TiO2 when modified with lignin. The conversion of 2-propanol
in an aqueous solution was evaluated in the presence of TiO2 and several lignin@TiO2 NPs at 35–38 °C under
combined UVA–UVB irradiation. Control experiments under dark
conditions were also performed. Figure 5 shows the photocatalytic activities exhibited by the
different lignin@TiO2 composites compared to those of the
pristine TiO2. Notice that 2-propanol is totally consumed
after 3 h of irradiation in the presence of TiO2, but different
percentages of alcohol still remain when treated with lignin-modified
TiO2. Thus, although the strategy used to synthesize the
lignin@TiO2 is based on the photocatalytic activity of
TiO2, the new composites exhibit the capacity to inhibit
free radical reactions. This concept underlies the basic premise of
this work: understanding catalysis helps design sunscreens; that is, although the objectives of the materials designed are
opposite, the knowledge requirements are much the same. Indeed, the
particles showing the worst photocatalytic activity were chosen as
the best potential sunscreens. From Figure 5, L1@TiO2, L2@TiO2,
and L3@TiO2 were selected for further examination, although
L4@TiO2 also shows excellent performance.

L1@TiO2 (blue), and L2@TiO2 (red). (B) TiO2 (black), L3@TiO2 (blue), L4@TiO2 (red),
L5@TiO2 (green), and L6@TiO2 (violet).

Enzyme Inhibition: TiO2-Mediated Photodamage
In addition to the decrease
in the photocatalytic activity demonstrated
for the lignin-modified TiO2, the new composites also need
to be innocuous for future topical uses. To evaluate this, we tested
the enzymatic activity of ALP after exposure to different lignin@TiO2 NPs. It is well known that bare TiO2 can act as
an enzyme inhibitor through a process not yet fully understood22 but accelerated by UV light and most likely
radical-mediated.23 Hence, we carried out
an enzymatic assay using ALP pretreated with different particles under
light exposure and under dark conditions. Equation 1 shows the dephosphorylation reaction used
to determine the enzymatic activity, simply by monitoring the formation
of p-nitrophenol using UV–vis spectroscopy. 1  

The kinetic
traces (Figure 6) acquired
at 405 nm for the
formation of p-nitrophenol are a reflection of the
activity of the enzyme. Each curve is then fitted with the expression 2  where A is the absorbance
and t is the time. The coefficients a, b, and c are fitting parameters.
The derivative of this expression with respect to t is given by 3  which at t = 0 corresponds to b. That is, the first
coefficient (b) of the quadratic fit is the calculated
initial slope. These slopes have been used as a measure of the initial
enzymatic activity.

Figure 6 Kinetic slopes of the enzymatic activity of ALP acquired
at 405
nm for the dephosphorylation of PNNP. Traces recorded after the enzyme
pretreatment in the absence of particles (black) and in the presence
of TiO2 (blue) or L1@TiO2 (red). Circles represent
dark conditions, and diamonds represent UVA irradiation for 30 min.

Figure 7 shows the
initial rates calculated for the enzymatic activity of ALP after treatment
with TiO2 and lignin@TiO2 particles. As expected,
TiO2 can decrease the enzymatic activity simply by contact
(dark conditions), but exposure to UV light can
exacerbate this inhibition. Coating the TiO2 NPs with lignin
prevents the enzyme inactivation even under light irradiation. These
results indicate clearly that the UVA irradiation does not affect
the enzyme and, more importantly, lignin@TiO2 NPs are completely
innocuous for the enzymatic activity under dark conditions. The TiO2-mediated photodamage under UVA irradiation is highly reduced
in the presence of lignin, and the L1@TiO2 composite shows
no enzyme inactivation. Clearly, the changes that prevent alcohol
photo-oxidation also inhibit enzyme inactivation.

Figure 7 Initial rates calculated
for the enzymatic activity of ALP in the
dark and upon UVA irradiation in the absence (black/gray) and in the
presence of TiO2 (blue), L1@TiO2 (red), L2@TiO2 (green), and L3@TiO2 (violet).

Compatibility with Avobenzone
Finally,
to determine
the compatibility of these new particles with other sunscreen ingredients,
the photoprotection of avobenzone was tested. Avobenzone is a widely
used UVA protector, largely present in an enol form that photodegrades
readily upon UVA–UVB exposure through a mechanism involving
a photoinduced enol–keto transformation.24 Other sunscreens can stabilize avobenzone either by competitive
light absorption (or scattering) or by quenching its excited states.25 Given the ubiquitous use of avobenzone, we felt
that it was important to establish its compatibility with the new
hybrid materials to evaluate as to what extent they could be involved
in the process of photodegradation or photoprotection of avobenzone.

Figure 8 shows the
photodegradation of avobenzone after exposure to 2 and 4 h of UVA–UVB
irradiation using different amounts of particles. Notice that at lower
particle concentrations, TiO2 can act as a photoprotector
(graphs A and B), although when the TiO2 particle concentration
is increased this ability is lost. By contrast, the new particles
retain the photoprotection ability even at high TiO2 concentrations.
These results show that the new particles not only preserve the photoprotection
properties that TiO2 provides to avobenzone (graph A) but
also prevent the photodegradation of avobenzone when the amount of
TiO2 added generates a high concentration of ROS (graph
C). This opens the opportunity to increase the amount of TiO2 particles in formulations preserving the integrity of other organic
active ingredients.

particles:

upon UVA–UVB irradiation in the absence (black) and in the
presence of TiO2 (blue), L1@TiO2 (red), L2@TiO2 (green), and L3@TiO2 (violet).

Conclusions
Regardless of its great
light absorption and scattering properties,
there are some health concerns about the use of TiO2 because
of its intrinsic photocatalytic properties. Thus, TiO2 can
generate ROS in the presence of water upon UVA irradiation. The in
vitro studies reported here suggest that TiO2 particles
can be modified to decrease their photocatalytic activity, while retaining
the absorption and scattering properties desirable for sunscreens
and cosmetic applications. Thus, the potential risks from TiO2-mediated free radical generation can be mitigated by shielding
the particles with a good antioxidant; in our case, we use a nontoxic,
biocompatible lignin shell that scavenges the free radicals before
they can exit the new TiO2–lignin composites, preserving
the scattering and the UV absorption characteristics. For this purpose,
we demonstrated that this stable lignin@TiO2 composite
plays an important role in reducing the photocatalytic activity of
TiO2 in chemical and enzymatic reactions, improving the
photoprotection of the other ingredients even when they are present
at high concentrations. To the best of our knowledge, from the cosmetic
and public perception point of view, we believe that the particles
described here, showing a nanometric size and a very light color,
are promising candidates as ingredients in skincare formulations,
especially for sunscreens, given that they are nontoxic and waterproof.
Additionally, our approach regarding the use of a safe and extremely
versatile material, mainly a byproduct of the paper industry, also
contributes to the development of eco-friendly processes for the cosmetic
industry.
