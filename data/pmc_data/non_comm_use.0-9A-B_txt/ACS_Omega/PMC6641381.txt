Corrections

The published article contains an error in the sketches of the
projected hexagonal cells that have been used to indicate two particular
substrate grain orientations and to label associated data. In the published article,
the projected hexagonal cells indicating the substrate grain orientations
∼Ti{101̅0} (blue, label D, 50° ≤ Φ ≤
90° and 0° ≤ φ2 ≤ 15°) and
∼Ti{21̅1̅0} (green, label E, 50° ≤ Φ
≤ 90° and 15° ≤ φ2 ≤ 30°)
are interchanged in Table 1 and Figures 2–4. The labels used in
Figure 1 are correct. The error does not affect the scientific
interpretation of the work.

Figure 2 Chemical maps from Ti 2p3/2 (always left) and C 1s (always
center) photoelectron micrographs of TiOC, and EBSD maps (always right)
of the corresponding Ti substrates. (a) TiOC550, (b) TiOC650, (c) TiOC750, and (d) TiOC850. To
facilitate discrimination between the different TiOCs, the chemical
maps are differently colored. Table: approximate orientation of the
labeled grains. Standard triangle: color-orientation code of the EBSD
maps.

Figure 3 Spectra from Ti 2p3/2 (top) and C 1s (bottom) core-level
maps of TiOC, acquired on top of substrate grains with five different
orientations, as indicated by the hexagonal cells using the color-orientation
code. (a, e) TiOC550, (b, f) TiOC650, (c, g)
TiOC750, and (d, h) TiOC850. The spectra in
(b, c) are scaled to the TiO2 component height.

Figure 4 Micro-Raman spectra of TiOC550, TiOC650,
and TiOC750 on top of (a, b) ∼Ti{101̅0} and
(c, d) ∼Ti(0001) and of two spots on TiOC850 with
different optical appearance (black and gray spectra). Purple spectrum
in (a): as-grown anodic TiO2. (b, d) Spectral range marked
by the box in (a, c). Baseline correction: (a, c) subtraction
of fourth-order polynomial function; constant shift to a common level
at (b) 800 cm–1 and (d) 150 cm–1. (e) Photographs of TiOC specimen.
