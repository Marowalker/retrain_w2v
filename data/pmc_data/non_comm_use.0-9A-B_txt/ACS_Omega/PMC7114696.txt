Oral potentially malignant disorder
(OPMD) is associated with an
increased risk of progression to oral cancer. Patients with dysplastic
changes of the precancerous lesions have a higher malignant transformation
rate than those without dysplastic changes. Radiotherapy and surgery
are the traditionally preferred choices for OPMD treatment. However,
side effects caused by radiotherapy and surgery may reduce the willingness
of patients to accept therapy. Therefore, developing an Orabase-formulated
drug, which can be non-invasively administered, may provide an alternative
treatment choice. To find, verify, and develop a new anti-cancer drug
cost a lot of time and money, while drug repurposing can shorten both
time and cost. In this study, we utilized high-throughput screening
library to identify clinical drugs, which may have new bioactivities.
Herein, we report that benzalkonium chloride (BAK), an antimicrobial
preservative for pharmaceutical products, significantly induced reactive
oxygen species production and cell death in oral precancerous cells.
Additionally, our results showed that phosphorylation of STAT3 (Tyr705)
and Akt (Ser473) were involved in cell death caused by BAK in DOK
cells. According to animal studies, the development of DMBA-induced
oral precancerous lesions was inhibited by 2% BAK. In conclusion,
Orabase-formulated BAK may be a potential treatment for OPMD in the
future.

Introduction
Oral squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC) constitutes 90% of oral cavity
malignancies. More importantly, early diagnosis is associated with
improved prognosis and survival rate.1 Late
diagnosis and metastasis lead to a decreased 5 year survival rate
of 9% for OSCC.2 If OSCC patients are diagnosed
early and treated before lymph node metastasis, the survival rate
increases to between 60 and 85%.2,3 Oral potentially malignant
disorder (OPMD) consists of several phenotypes, including oral submucous
fibrosis, hyperplasia, leukoplakia, erythroleukoplakia, and erythroplakia.
The incidence of OPMD progressing into OSCC is between 4 and 22%.4 Notably, the risks of progression to OSCC are
42.2 and 95% for leukoplakia and erythroleukoplakia, respectively,
after 20 years of follow-up.5 Therefore,
early diagnosis and treatment is crucial for improving prognosis.6

Nowadays, the choices for OPMD treatment
include surgical excision
and CO2 laser, but both are invasive approaches. Although
surgical excision can remove more tissue area to prevent the progression
into OSCC, it may lead to scarring and contracture. CO2 laser offers the advantage of reducing scarring but does not provide
tissue specimens for histopathology assessment.7 More importantly, the recurrence rate after CO2 laser treatment is 17–34%, which is relatively high.8 Therefore, manufacturing a convenient and non-invasive
Orabase-formulated drug may improve the patient’s treatment
compliance.

Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is a quaternary ammonium
compound used
as a cationic surfactant and antimicrobial preservative.9 Solutions containing BAK are widely applied against
bacteria, yeast, and fungi.10,11 BAK has three main
uses including being a biocide, a cationic surfactant, and a phase
transfer agent.12 It is the most common
preservative in ophthalmic, nasal, and otic products. However, BAK
is rarely intended for other routes of administration, such as oral,
cutaneous, vaginal, and rectal. Moreover, the use of BAK in oral precancerous
lesions treatment has not been previously reported.

Recently,
finding new bioactivities from previously approved drugs
has been accomplished by high-throughput screening (HTS) library,
which is referred to as drug repurposing.13 In this study, a cell-based HTS assay was applied to screen clinical
drugs for new indications, which showed that benzalkonium chloride
(BAK) was able to kill oral precancerous cells in vitro and in vivo.

Results
Identifying
Compounds with Anti-Oral Precancer Activity Using
HTS
The primary screening process was performed in 1536-well
plates following optimization of various parameters, including number
of DOK cells (2000), incubation time (72 h) and FBS concentration
(2%) in order to screen 122,323 compounds (Figure 1A). Based on the activity profile of these
compounds, 2814 hits, which demonstrated an activity of <0.35,
were selected for IC50 determination (Figure 1B). A total 1164 compounds that showed good
dose-dependent activity were identified from these 2814 hits (R2 > 0.8) (data not shown). From the primary
screening process, 239 compounds were selected for secondary screening
to evaluate their IC50 in 384-well plates. At the end of
the secondary screening process, 41 compounds were found to fulfil
the following three criteria: high cytotoxic activity against oral
precancerous cells, potential for topical administration, and not
previously used for cancer treatment. After HTS screening, the selected
compounds were used for cell-based experiments, and the new Orabase
formulations were used for animal experiments. Because cisplatin is
a commonly used clinical drug for oral cancer, it was used as a control
to analyze the anti-precancer activity of the selected compounds.
According to the results from the primary and secondary screening
processes, the IC50 of BAK was 0.56 μM, which was
much lower than cisplatin (IC50 20 μM) (Figure 1C).

Evaluation of Anti-Oral Precancer Activity of BAK
The
chemical structure of BAK was presented in Figure 2A. We next assessed BAK-induced cell death
in DOK cells. The percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase was increased
from 5 to 30% when the concentration of BAK was increased from 5 to
15 μM (Figure 2B). To verify whether this was due to necrosis or apoptosis, we used
Annexin V staining to distinguish the form of cell death. 10 μM
BAK significantly increased the number of propidium iodide+/Annexin V+ DOK cells from 2 to 24 h (Figure 2C). Furthermore, we determined
the expression of apoptotic proteins after treatment of DOK cells
with 10 μM BAK. As seen in Figure 2D, the active cleaved forms of Caspase-7,
Caspase-9, Caspase-3, and PARP were significantly increased in a time-dependent
manner. In addition, the marker for DNA fragmentation, phospho-H2AX
(γH2AX), was increased from 2 to 24 h.

BAK Induced Oral Precancer
Cell Death through Stimulating ROS
Production and Suppressing pSTAT3 and pAkt
Next, we studied
the underlying mechanisms involved in BAK-induced apoptosis in oral
precancer cells. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
could result in increased level of γH2AX through causing DNA
breaks.14 Since we found that the level
of γH2AX was increased in BAK-treated DOK cells, we next determined
the intracellular ROS level using DCFDA and DHE assays. Our results
showed that treatment of DOK cells with BAK led to increased DCFDA
and DHE levels (Figure 3A). ROS production has been previously found to induce apoptosis
through suppressing the phosphorylation of STAT3 in hepatocellular
carcinoma.15 Therefore, we determined the
level of p-STAT3 (Tyr705) in DOK cells treated with BAK. As seen in Figure 3B, the level of p-STAT3
(Tyr705) was decreased following BAK treatment. To verify whether
STAT3 played a role in cell death induced by BAK, the STAT3 inhibitor
Stattic was used to suppress STAT3 activity (Figure S1). STAT3 inhibitor increased the cell death ratio from 50
to 70% in BAK-treated DOK cells (Figure 3C). It is also known that PI3K/Akt is an
important signaling pathway for cell survival.16 As seen in Figure 3B, the level of p-Akt (Ser473) in DOK cells was decreased,
following treatment with different doses of BAK from 5 to 15 μM.
Combined treatment of DOK cells with Wortmannin, a PI3K/Akt inhibitor,
and BAK resulted in increased cell death (Figure 3D).

BAK Suppressed Oral Precancerous Lesions Development In Vivo
We used hamsters as an animal model to investigate the effect of
BAK on the development of oral precancerous lesions. The preparation
of Orabase-formulated BAK and the experimental procedure for the hamster
model are described in the Methods section,
and the experimental protocol is presented in Figure 4A. The macroscopic features of the buccal
pouch between Group A (hamsters with no treatment) and Group B (hamsters
treated with BAK only) were similar (Figure 4B). Although oral lesions were seen in Group
C (hamsters treated with DMBA only), no obvious lesions were found
in Group D (hamsters treated with DMBA followed by 2% BAK) (Figure 4B). Additionally,
histological examination of Group C lesions demonstrated epithelial
hyperplasia and moderate to severe epithelial dysplasia. In contrast,
the histological examination of buccal pouch tissues from Group D
showed only slightly thickened lamina propria (Figure 4B). After treatment with BAK for 3 weeks,
the tumor volume in Group D was found to be smaller than Group C (Figure 4C). It was worth
noting that biomedical parameters and body weight did not differ significantly
between Groups C and D (Figure S2).

Discussion
In this study, we found by HTS screening
that the clinically used
drug benzalkonium chloride (BAK) exhibited apoptotic activity against
DOK oral precancer cells, which was mediated by ROS production and
inhibition of STAT3 and Akt signal transduction pathways. In addition,
we manufactured a new Orabase-formulated BAK, which suppressed oral
precancerous lesions development in hamsters.

HTS is a well-known
technology that has been used for identifying
new biological activities from clinical drugs over the past 20 years.
In particular, HTS has been applied in the discovery and development
of several FDA-approved drugs for cancer therapy.17 The HTS platform for small molecule screening has several
advantages, including low-volume assay, parallel data generation,
cost-effectiveness, and shortened development timeline for drug repurposing.18 In this study, we used the HTS assay to discover
a new indication for BAK in causing apoptosis of oral precancerous
cells.

In the field of oral diseases treatment, sustained release
drug
formulations with mucoadhesive characteristics can improve treatment
efficacy, decrease drug wastage, reduce systemic side effects, and
increase patient compliance.19,20 Due to these benefits,
topical oral gels have been extensively used as anti-inflammatory,
anti-fungal, and mucoprotective formulations.20 BAK has been commonly used in ophthalmic preparations as an effective
anti-bacterial and fungicidal agent since the 1950s.21 However, it has not been previously reported whether BAK
may be effective in cancer therapy, especially for OPMD. In this study,
we provide the first evidence that Orabase-formulated BAK may be an
effective treatment modality for OPMD.

Drug repurposing is beneficial
for identifying new clinical applications
from FDA-approved drugs.2 Because most
repurposed drugs have already completed the safety assessment and
preclinical testing stages, the time and cost for the approval of
drug repurposing are significantly reduced.22 According to our findings, we believe that this new formulation
of Orabase BAK is a potential local and non-invasive treatment for
OPMD.

Conclusions
Orabase-formulated BAK may be a potential
topical, non-invasive, and function-preserving therapeutic strategy
for OPMD lesions and may prevent their progression into oral cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
Human oral precancerous
cells (DOK) were
maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture
F-12 (DMEM/F12) with fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin/streptomycin
(100 U/mL), l-glutamine (1%) and non-essential amino acids
(1%) in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.

High-Throughput
Screening Assay
1536-well plates were
used for primary screening at the Genomics Research Center of Academia
Sinica, Taiwan. To determine HTS assay criteria, various culture media
and freezing media were evaluated, and the optimal condition was selected
for large-scale screening. For the HTS assay, various cell numbers
of DOK (100–5000 cells/well) in different FBS concentrations
were added into 1536-well plates. Following incubation for 48 or 72
h, Cell TiterGlo (Promega) was used to evaluate cell proliferation.
The CV% was determined as 8–10% and the Z′
value was determined as 0.63. The most effective primary hits were
identified for secondary screening to determine IC50 values.
DOK cells were treated with the compounds from primary hits at 10-point
3-fold serial dilutions, starting from 21 μM. After 72 h, Cell
TiterGlo (Promega) was used to determine cell proliferation, and the
values were used to calculate the IC50.

XTT Assay
First, 5 × 103 DOK cells were seeded
into 96-well plates and incubated overnight
to allow cells to attach. After treatment of DOK cells with different
drugs for 48 h, the XTT assay was used to analyze cell proliferation.
The detailed procedures were in accordance with a previous study.23

Cell Cycle Analysis
First, 1.5 ×
105 DOK cells were seeded into 6-well plates
and
incubated overnight to allow cells to attach. After treatment of DOK
cells with different doses of BAK (5, 10, and 15 μM) for 24
h, harvested cells were stained with a propidium iodide solution (0.2
g/mL RnaseA, 0.02 mg/mL propidium iodide, and 0.05% Triton-X 100 in
PBS) at room temperature for 10 min. The cell cycle distribution was
analyzed by BeckmanCoulterFC500 and Flow Jo software.

Propidium Iodide/Annexin
V Assay
First, 1.5 ×
105 DOK cells were seeded into 6-well plates and incubated
overnight. After treatment of DOK cells with BAK for 2, 8, and 24
h, harvested cells were stained with propidium iodide and Annexin
V-FITC in a dark environment for 20 min. Stained samples were evaluated
by BeckmanCoulterFC500 and Flow Jo software.

Western Blotting
First, 6 × 105 DOK
cells were seeded into 6 cm plates and incubated overnight. Following
the treatment of DOK cells with BAK, Stattic, or Wortmannin, cell
lysates were obtained and lysed in an RIPA buffer containing a proteinase
inhibitor. The protein lysates were loaded onto SDS-PAGE, and proteins
were transferred onto PVDF membranes and reacted with primary antibodies
followed by secondary antibodies (Jackson, USA). Finally, the signals
were amplified by ECL (Perkin Elmer, USA), imaged by ChemiDoc XRS+
System (BioRad, USA) and quantified by Image Lab software (BioRad,
USA). Primary antibodies against pSTAT3(Tyr705), STAT3, pAkt(Ser473),
Akt, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-7, cleaved
PARP, γH2AX, and beta-Actin (GeneTex, USA) were used for Western
blotting.

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Detection
First, 1.5
× 105 DOK cells were seeded into 6-well plates and
incubated overnight. DOK cells were treated with different doses of
BAK (5, 10, and 15 μM) for 4 h and stained with 10 μM
DCFDA or DHE in a dark environment for 30 min. The mean fluorescence
intensities were analyzed by BeckmanCoulterFC500 and Flow Jo software.

Orabase-Formulated Benzalkonium Chloride
HPMC4000 (5%)
(Shin Etsu, Japan), ethanol (10%) (Merck, Germany), carbitol (10%)
(Merck, Germany), BAK (2%) (Merck, Germany), and distilled water were
used to manufacture Orabase-formulated BAK. First, BAK was dissolved
in distilled water and mixed for >12 h, and then 5% HPMC4000, 10%
ethanol, and 10% carbitol were added into the mixture in sequence.
Orabase-formulated BAK was stored inside a brown bottle.

Animal Study
The animal study was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan.
Animal experiments were conducted according to the Animal Research:
Reporting in Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. We used 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene
(DMBA) (Merck, Germany) to induce oral precancerous lesions on the
hamsters’ buccal pouch (NLAC, Taiwan)24,25 followed by 2% BAK treatment once weekly with the experimental protocol
shown in Figure 4A.
First, 16 male Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricatus auratus), which
weighed 80–100 g were randomly allocated into four different
groups. Group A (n = 2) comprised hamsters with no
treatment. Group B (i = 2) comprised hamsters treated with 2% BAK
only. For the experimental groups (Groups C and D), 0.5% DMBA (in
mineral oil) was applied 10 times onto the buccal pouch three times
weekly for 9 weeks. Group C (n = 3) comprised hamsters
treated with DMBA only. Group D (n = 9) comprised
hamsters treated with DMBA followed by 2% BAK. At the 13th week, animals
were sacrificed by Zoletil injection followed by CO2 asphyxiation.
Tumor volume was determined once a week based on the following formula:
(width2 × length)/2.

Hematoxylin–Eosin
Staining
Excised buccal pouches
from hamsters were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and embedded
in paraffin. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Slides were washed briefly in distilled water and stained in a hematoxylin
solution for 10 min followed by washing in running tap water for 5
min, 1% acid for 30 s and running tap water for 1 min, 0.2% ammonia
water for 30 s, and washing was repeated as in the previous step.
Slides were rinsed in 95% alcohol, counterstained in an eosin–phloxine
solution for 30 s, and dehydrated in 95% alcohol twice for 5 min each.
Slides were finally washed in xylene and mounted for viewing.

Statistical
Analysis
All experiments were performed
at least three times. Quantitative data were presented as mean ±
standard error (SE) from three independent experiments. To compare
multiple groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
post hoc Tukey’s test was used. To compare two groups, the
independent t test was employed. Statistical significance
was defined as P value less than 0.05.
