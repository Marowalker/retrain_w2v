The equilibrium stabilities and the
folding rates of membrane-bound
proteins are determined by hydrophobic and polar intermolecular contacts
with their environment as well as by intramolecular packing and conformational
dynamics. The contributions of these factors, however, remain elusive
and might vary considerably among proteins. Mistic from Bacillus subtilis is a particularly intriguing example
of an α-helical protein that associates with membranes in spite
of its unusual hydrophilicity. In micelles, Mistic is stabilized by
hydrophobic and polar interactions with detergents, but it is unclear
whether and how these intermolecular contacts are coupled to structural
and dynamic adaptations of the protein itself. Here, we investigated
the packing and the conformational dynamics of Mistic as functions
of detergent headgroup chemistry and chain length, employing single-molecule
Förster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy and time-resolved
intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy. Surprisingly, in nonionic
detergents, more effective hydrophobic burial and, thus, greater protein
stability with increasing hydrophobic micellar thickness were accompanied
by a gradual loosening of the helical bundle. By contrast, Mistic
was found to assume a stable, compact fold in zwitterionic detergents
that allowed faster dynamics on the nanosecond timescale. Thus, intramolecular
packing per se is insufficient for conferring high
protein stability; instead, enhanced nanosecond dynamics and, consequently,
greater conformational entropy in the compact folded state account
for Mistic’s high equilibrium stability and fast folding rates
in zwitterionic micelles even at the expense of less effective hydrophobic
burial.

INTRODUCTION
The folded states of
membrane-associated proteins are stabilized
by both intramolecular interactions upon packing1−5 and intermolecular interactions in the form of contacts
with their membrane and water environment.4,5 For
integral membrane proteins, which are firmly attached to lipid bilayers
through very hydrophobic transmembrane segments, the contributions
of these factors to protein stability are increasingly well understood.4−6 By contrast, the situation is less clear for membrane-interacting
proteins that self-insert into the membrane and whose membrane attachment,
therefore, cannot rely on pronounced hydrophobicity. Moreover, the
role of protein dynamics and, hence, conformational entropy4,5 remains poorly understood for this class of proteins even though
it could be crucial because of the large entropic changes that accompany
coupled membrane binding and folding.7,8 A prominent
example of a self-inserting protein is Mistic9 from Bacillus subtilis, a small membrane-associated
protein essential for the regulation of bacterial biofilm formation.10 The protein contains 110 residues arranged into
four α-helices. In spite of its polar, charged surface with
a calculated pI of 4.5 and a net charge of −12 at pH 7, the
helical bundle is tightly associated with membranes in vivo9,11,12 and membrane-mimetic systems
such as detergent micelles in vitro.9,12−17 Lacking a signal recognition sequence, Mistic self-inserts into
the bacterial membrane without the need for a translocon machinery.9 Remarkably, polar and charged residues are distributed
all over the protein9 rather than being
clustered in distinct regions that could represent extramembraneous
domains flanking a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, as is the case
with canonical integral membrane proteins.

Consequently, the
question arises as to the nature of the interactions
that stabilize this unusually hydrophilic protein and promote its
association with membranes and membrane mimics. When solubilized in
detergent micelles, Mistic’s helical bundle is stabilized by
both hydrophobic burial in the nonpolar micellar core and polar interactions
with detergent headgroups, as borne out by protein-unfolding experiments
at both the ensemble13 and the single-molecule17 levels. By contrast, the secondary-structure
content of Mistic is virtually unaffected by the nature of the detergent
making up the micellar environment, as demonstrated by far-UV circular
dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.13 Yet, it
remains unclear whether and how changes in protein stability and intermolecular
contacts with the complex, anisotropic membrane-mimetic environment
are coupled to higher-order structural adaptations or to alterations
in the conformational dynamics of the protein itself.

To better
understand the interrelationship among protein compaction,
hydrophobic shielding, dynamics, and stability in different membrane
mimics, we have investigated the effects of hydrophobic thickness
and headgroup properties in various detergent micelles. To this end,
we employed single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer
(smFRET) spectroscopy and time-resolved intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy
at the ensemble level to investigate protein compaction and conformational
dynamics as functions of the micellar environment. Surprisingly, the
degree of compaction was found to be inversely correlated with the
protein’s equilibrium stability in nonionic micelles, whereas
faster conformational dynamics and, as a corollary, greater conformational
folded-state entropy in zwitterionic detergent micelles superseded
poor hydrophobic shielding to afford high equilibrium stability and
fast folding.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Structural adaptations
of Mistic to its micellar environment
We made use of smFRET
confocal spectroscopy to probe the overall
fold and, in particular, the degree of compaction of Mistic in response
to changes in its micellar environment. To this end, we created a
protein variant (Mistic3,110) that was site-specifically
labeled with acceptor (ATTO647N) and donor (ATTO532) dyes at positions
3 and 110, respectively (Figure 1a). To assess the influence of hydrophobic thickness,
we used alkyl maltoside detergents ranging in chain length from C8
to C12 (Figure 1b),
that is, n-octyl-β-d-maltopyranoside
(OM), n-nonyl-β-d-maltopyranoside
(NM), n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside
(DM), n-undecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside
(UM), and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside
(DDM). Moreover, to explore the influence of polar contacts and hydration,
we employed C12 detergents with amine oxide and phosphocholine headgroups
(Figure 1b), that is,
lauryldimethylamine N-oxide (LDAO) and n-dodecylphosphocholine (DPC), respectively. Each detergent was used
at a concentration of at least 1 mM above its critical micellar concentration
(CMC; cf. Table S1) to ensure the presence
of micelles.

on an
NMR structure of Mistic (PDB 1YGM) in the presence of LDAO with extrinsic acceptor (red, ATTO647N) and donor (green, ATTO532)
dyes attached to positions 3 and 110, respectively, as well as the
native Trp13 residue (blue). (b) Chemical structures
of detergents used.

Fluorescence bursts from
a large number of individual molecules
were analyzed to generate histograms of FRET efficiency, E (Figure 2a,b). For
the homologous alkyl maltoside series, all histograms revealed a unimodal
distribution that shifted monotonically from intermediate efficiencies
in long-chain detergents (i.e., DDM) to higher efficiencies in short-chain
detergents (i.e., OM; Figure 2a). The shift in peak position, Emax, was accompanied by a marked decrease in the width of the distribution,
as gauged by the FWHM of normal-distribution fits to the histograms
(Figure 2c, Table S2). This translates into a width of the
structural ensemble of 1.4 nm in DDM and 1.0 nm in OM with mean interdye
distances of 5.3 nm and 4.5 nm, respectively. Thus, in nonionic detergent
micelles, Mistic became more compactly folded and less broadly distributed
in terms of size with decreasing alkyl chain length. The peak broadening
observed in long-chain alkyl maltosides (i.e., DDM) can be attributed
to molecular-state heterogeneity as the width is in large excess of
that expected for shot noise alone (Figure S1a). Conversely, for short-chain alkyl maltosides (i.e., OM), the much
narrower distribution width coincides with the estimated shot-noise
width, indicating a compact conformational ensemble (Figure S1a). Recurrence analysis18 in DDM further showed that conformational transitions among substates
occur on timescales slower than 20 ms (Figure S2), so conformational heterogeneity can be traced back to
an ensemble of structures that interconvert on timescales much slower
than the observation time. Interestingly, conformational compaction
was thus found to anticorrelate with protein stability, as the molar
Gibbs free-energy change upon unfolding, ΔG°(H2O), drastically decreases on going from DDM (ΔG°(H2O) = 16.3 kJ/mol) to OM (ΔG°(H2O) < 7 kJ/mol).13

micelles. (a) Histograms of FRET efficiency, E, of

fits (black lines). (b) E histograms

at 24 °C; buffer: 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane (Tris),
50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4.

By contrast, in DPC and
LDAO, FRET distributions were shifted to
higher Emax values, with mean interdye
distances of 4.7 nm in DPC and LDAO, and were much narrower as compared
with those of DDM, with widths of 0.7 nm in DPC and 0.9 nm in LDAO.
This indicates that Mistic underwent considerable compaction when
solubilized in zwitterionic detergents. Moreover, the degrees of broadening
in DPC and LDAO were similar to that in OM (Figure S1b), indicating comparable levels of compaction and conformational
heterogeneity. In striking contrast with the case of OM, however,
protein compaction in zwitterionic micelles goes in hand with an increase
in stability, which amounts to ΔG°(H2O) = 18.5 kJ/mol in DPC and even results in resistance toward
complete unfolding in LDAO.13,15 Two other protein variants
fluorescently labeled at positions 3 and 88 (Mistic3,88, Figure S3) and at positions 30 and 110
(Mistic30,110, Figure S4) revealed
the same dependences on detergent chain length and headgroup chemistry,
thereby demonstrating that the above findings were not specific to
the Mistic3,110 variant but reflected a global, overall
compaction of the micelle-embedded protein with decreasing chain length
in nonionic alkyl maltosides and upon immersion in zwitterionic detergents.

In a next set of experiments, we followed intrinsic protein fluorescence
of the single tryptophan residue at position 13 in Mistic’s
first helix (Figure 1a) to study protein dynamics in the vicinity of the lone tryptophan
residue on the nanosecond timescale. To relate protein compaction
to the size of the protein/detergent complex, we performed time-resolved
fluorescence anisotropy measurements to probe the rotational diffusion
of Trp13. Experimental anisotropy decays were fitted using biexponential
functions reflecting two rotational correlation times (Figure S5, Table S3). Whereas the faster of the two rotational correlation times, θfast, is known to reflect the segmental mobility of the fluorophore,
the slower one, θslow, reports on the rotational
diffusion of the protein/detergent complex (eq S5).19 To enhance the robustness
of the fits, we reduced the number of floating parameters by fixing
θfast at 0.5 ns, a value typical of single-tryptophan
proteins.20 Accordingly, we used θslow to estimate the hydrodynamic volume of the protein/detergent
complex, V, that is, the volume of a (hypothetical)
sphere that would rotate with the same correlation time (eq S6).19 The volumes
thus estimated (Figure 3a, Table S3) are in reasonable agreement
with the values expected for spherical protein/detergent complexes
with radii of 2–3 nm.

Overall, V reproduced the trends
found for protein
compaction. In alkyl maltosides, V monotonically
decreased with decreasing chain length with values of 90 and 60 nm3 for DDM and OM, respectively. This dependence of the hydrodynamic
volume on detergent chain length is in good agreement with the reported
decrease in the overall molar mass of the protein/detergent complex.21 For Mistic in LDAO and DPC, V was significantly lower, at 47 and 51 nm3, respectively,
which goes in hand with the fact that protein-free LDAO and DPC micelles
are much smaller than DDM micelles, with molar masses of 17, 25, and
72 kg/mol for micelles composed of LDAO, DPC, and DDM, respectively.22 In conclusion, we found the degree of protein
compaction to strongly correlate with the size of the protein/detergent
complex, which, in turn, closely follows the size dependence of protein-free
micelles. This then indicates that the effective hydrophobic micelle
thickness, which becomes smaller for shorter alkyl chains and more
hydrated headgroups, dictates the extent of protein compaction.

We further wondered whether a more compact structure also indicates
more pronounced hydrophobic burial. To this end, we used time-resolved
acrylamide quenching experiments to estimate the accessibility of
Trp13 to the aqueous solvent.19 We quantified
quenching efficiencies in terms of the bimolecular quenching rate
constant, kq (Figure 3b, Table S4),
which was derived from the gradual decrease of fluorescence lifetime
with increasing quencher concentration (Figure S6; eq S9). Interestingly, when
solubilized in alkyl maltoside micelles, kq increased from 0.27 M–1 ns–1 (DDM) to 0.43 M–1 ns–1 (OM)
with decreasing chain length. This indicates that, despite the more
compacted fold in OM, Mistic’s Trp13 became increasingly exposed
to the aqueous solvent. Replacing the nonionic maltose headgroup with
a zwitterionic headgroup while retaining a C12 alkyl chain led to
a marked increase in kq (0.53 M–1 ns–1 for both LDAO and DPC). These results are
in line with the steady-state emission maximum of Trp13,13 which blue-shifts with increasing alkyl chain
length from OM (∼338 nm upon excitation at 295 nm) to DDM (∼333
nm) but is red-shifted in LDAO and DPC (∼339 nm and ∼337
nm, respectively) as compared with DDM. The differences in quenching
efficiency and steady-state emission spectra between nonionic and
zwitterionic C12 detergents are consistently explained by the extent
of water penetration into the micellar headgroup region, which is
much deeper in LDAO23 and DPC24 than in DDM.25

Taken together, the present smFRET, anisotropy, and quenching data
and our previous protein-stability experiments13 unveil contrasting behaviors of Mistic in nonionic vs.
zwitterionic micelles: Whereas polar headgroup contacts in small zwitterionic
micelles induce a compact fold that is thermodynamically stable in
spite of poor shielding from the aqueous solvent, Mistic readily sacrifices
tight intramolecular packing for the benefit of deeper hydrophobic
burial accompanied by greater stability as the size of nonionic micelles
is increased. Thus, although intramolecular interactions enabled by
protein compaction and the release of hydration water molecules upon
hydrophobic burial generally make important contributions to protein
stability,4,5 neither of these factors governs the thermodynamic
stability of Mistic.

Conformational dynamics of the protein/detergent
complex on
the nanosecond timescale
The absence of simple structural
predictors prompted us to dissect the role of dynamic processes in
determining protein stability in membrane-mimetic environments. To
this end, we measured time-resolved emission spectra (TRES) of the
native Trp13 chromophore of Mistic to extract time-dependent fluorescence
shifts (TDFSs). These serve as sensitive metrics of dipolar relaxation
and allow determination of the correlation time, τcor (eqs S14–S15), which reports on
the nanosecond fluctuations of the protein/detergent complex around
the tryptophan chromophore.26 Using τcor, one can thus infer the roughness of the underlying energy
landscape of the folded state of the protein embedded in the respective
micellar environment. For Mistic, we constructed TRES (eqs S10–S12) and followed the temporal
progression of the average emission energy (eq S13, Figure S7). Differences in
detergent headgroup polarity manifested markedly in the nanosecond
relaxation dynamics. With values of 5.7–6.5 ns, τcor was similar in all alkyl maltosides irrespective of chain
length, whereas DPC and LDAO exhibited considerably smaller values
of 4.9 ns and 3.7 ns, respectively (Figure 3c, Table S5).
Strikingly, the differences in τcor among DDM, DPC,
and LDAO observed on the nanosecond timescale parallel the differences
among the same three detergents previously found for the folding dynamics
of Mistic on the microsecond timescale, with folding time constants
of ∼700, ∼70, and ∼30 μs for DDM, DPC,
and LDAO, respectively.17 This correlation
suggests that the large-scale folding dynamics of Mistic in the microsecond
regime may be coupled to small-scale conformational dynamics in the
nanosecond regime.26 Molecular dynamics
simulations of Mistic in LDAO micelles show a drift in the arrangement
of the four protein helices that occurs on a timescale of 20–30
ns without significant changes in the secondary structure.27 Although the starting point in these simulations
is different from the photoexcited state probed here, similar timescales
imply that rigid-body motions of the entire helical segments might
explain the nanosecond relaxation dynamics of Mistic.

Taken
together, we found Mistic to assume a compact yet highly dynamic fold
in zwitterionic micelles. This can explain its high thermodynamic
stability13 and fast folding rate17 in zwitterionic micelles because such pronounced
residual dynamics in the folded state should considerably reduce the
loss in conformational entropy incurred upon folding.26 Changes in the residual entropy of folded proteins have
been recognized as major determinants of ligand-binding affinity.28−31 The present results then imply that for membrane-interacting proteins
the conformational entropy of the folded state similarly depends on
interactions with the membrane or membrane-mimetic environment, thereby
suggesting that it acts as a major driving force in stabilizing the
native fold.

CONCLUSIONS
A complementary suite
of fluorescence-based methods allowed us
to draw a detailed picture of how the conformational dynamics of the
helical-bundle protein Mistic in different membrane mimics are coupled
to structural adaptations of the protein, its intermolecular contacts
with the complex, anisotropic solvent, as well as its equilibrium
stability and folding kinetics. In nonionic detergents, Mistic achieves
higher stability with increasing micellar thickness by a gradual loosening
of its helical bundle that results in greater structural heterogeneity.
In the language of simple free-energy landscapes (Figure 4), this corresponds to a transition
from a narrow, moderately rugged folded-state minimum (Figure 4a) to a broader, heterogeneous
conformational distribution with significant free-energy barriers
(Figure 4b). By contrast,
in zwitterionic micelles, which offer less effective shielding from
water but promote richer polar contacts with detergent headgroups,
Mistic assumes a stable and compact yet dynamic fold with reduced
free-energy barriers within a narrow folded-state minimum (Figure 4c). Because Mistic
exhibits a similar equilibrium unfolding behavior in the anionic detergent
sodium dodecyl sulfate to that in LDAO and DPC,13 it appears very likely that the situation observed here
for zwitterionic detergents is representative of ionic detergents
as well. Furthermore, our results underpin the extraordinary relevance
of electrostatic interactions between the highly polar surface of
Mistic and (zwitter)ionic headgroups in stabilizing this unusual protein
within a membrane-mimetic environment. Future experiments on reconstituted
proteoliposomes of various lipid compositions will shed light on how
the membrane-associated state of Mistic is affected by different lipid-bilayer
properties and how this relates to differences in in vitro production
yields and folding efficiencies of Mistic in cell-free expression
systems.14 In summary, the present findings
imply that across various timescales and resulting from different
mechanisms, enhanced folded-state dynamics and, thus, increased conformational
entropy play a dominant role in reshaping Mistic’s free-energy
landscape, so as to endow the protein with high equilibrium stability
and fast folding kinetics.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Materials
All
chemicals were purchased with the highest
purity available. OM, NM, DM, UM, DDM, and DPC were from Glycon Biochemicals
(Luckenwalde, Germany) or Anatrace (Maumee, USA). LDAO was from Anatrace,
Tris from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), NaCl (AnalaR Normapur) from
VWR (Darmstadt, Germany) or Carl Roth, 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) from
Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), and N-propargyl-L-lysine
(PrK) from SiChem (Bremen, Germany). ATTO532 maleimide and ATTO647N
azide were from Atto-Tec (Siegen, Germany).

Protein preparation
Production and purification of
the wild-type protein and detergent exchange were performed as described
elsewhere.13 Briefly, Mistic was recombinantly
produced with a hexahistidine tag in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells using a pET-30 EK/LIC expression vector (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany). Cells were lysed by sonification, cell debris
was removed by centrifugation, and the tagged protein was purified
in LDAO by immobilized-metal ion affinity (IMAC) chromatography. The
tag was removed by digestion with enterokinase32 followed by anion-exchange chromatography (AIX). An additional
IMAC step was performed to collect tag-free protein in the flow-through.
Detergent was exchanged by AIX and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC).

For smFRET experiments, three protein variants (i.e., Mistic3,110, Mistic30,110, and Mistic3,88)
were engineered that contained the unnatural amino acid PrK and a
unique Cys incorporated at residues 3 and 110, 30 and 110, or 3 and
88, respectively. Recombinant protein production was performed in E. coli using the pEvol vector system (pEvol PylRS)
from Methanosarcina mazei for incorporation
of PrK.33 After purification following
published procedures,17,34 the protein variants were orthogonally
labeled with azide-functionalized acceptor (ATTO647N) and maleimide-functionalized
donor (ATTO532) fluorophores using alkyne–azide click chemistry
and thiol–maleimide coupling.17,34 Labeled proteins
were separated from unbound dyes by SEC.

smFRET spectroscopy
Observations of single-molecule
fluorescence were made using a custom-built dual-color, dual-polarization
epi-fluorescence confocal setup based on an inverted microscope (Eclipse
Ti-E, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), which was equipped with a high-numerical
aperture water immersion objective (CFI Plan Apo WI 60x, NA 1.2, Nikon,
Tokyo, Japan) and two linearly polarized 530-nm and 640-nm picosecond
pulsed laser sources (LDH-P-FA-530L and LDH-D-C-640, both from PicoQuant,
Berlin, Germany) for pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE). Emitted
donor and acceptor fluorescence were detected by single-photon-counting
avalanche diodes (τ-SPADs, PicoQuant) coupled to a time-correlated
single-photon-counting (TCSPC) module (HydraHarp 400, PicoQuant),
as detailed elsewhere.17 Measurements were
performed at 24 °C on freely diffusing molecules. Labeled Mistic
variants were diluted from stock solutions into buffer (50 mM Tris,
50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing the respective detergent at a micellar
concentration of 1 mM (i.e., CMC + 1 mM; Table S1) to a final protein concentration of ∼5 pM to obtain
burst rates under single-molecule conditions. The illumination power
was 110 μW for excitation of the donor dye and 90 μW for
direct excitation of the acceptor dye.

Data analysis was performed
with custom-written Matlab scripts (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) following
procedures described previously.17,34 Briefly, after
identification of bursts with a search algorithm (using maximum interphoton
time of 50 μs, minimum total number of 100 photons after background
correction, and a Lee filter of 4), histograms of FRET efficiency, E, with bin widths of 0.03 were constructed from bursts
exhibiting a stoichiometry ratio of S = 0.35–0.7
and an alternating laser excitation–two-channel kernel-based
density distribution estimator (ALEX-2CDE) score <10.35 Additionally, an asymmetric burst filter was
applied using a channel-asymmetry time of <50 μs.36E values were corrected for
background, direct acceptor excitation, channel cross-talk, as well
as differences in detector efficiencies and quantum yields between
the dyes, as described previously.34 Apparent
FRET efficiencies, E*, used in probability-distribution
analysis (PDA) were calculated without applying the aforementioned
corrections. E histogram distributions were fitted
with normal or log-normal distributions to extract E values at peak positions, Emax, as well
as the full-width at half-maximum height (FWHM). Distances, r, were estimated on the basis of the Förster equation, r = R0 × (1/E – 1)1/6, where R0 is
the Förster distance of the ATTO532/ATTO647N FRET pair (R0 = 5.9 nm),37 with
the assumption that the fluorophores can freely rotate at the labeling
site. Estimated histogram shot-noise-limited distribution widths (see Figure S1) were generated by simulation using
static PDA.38,39 Recurrence analysis of single
particles (RASP) (see Figure S2) was performed
as previously described.18,40

Tryptophan Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
General
Samples contained 4 μM
Mistic in detergent
at a micellar concentration of 5 mM (Table S1) in buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). 5 mM DTT was freshly
added prior to measurements to prevent dimerization through the lone
cysteine residue at position 3. For each detergent, three samples
were prepared and measured independently. Experiments were performed
at 20 °C in a 3 mm × 3 mm quartz glass cuvette (Hellma,
Müllheim, Germany) on a FluoTime 300 spectrometer (PicoQuant),
equipped with a PLS 280 pulsed laser diode (PicoQuant) emitting at
(281 ± 5) nm and a 334-nm short-pass filter (LOT Quantum Design,
Darmstadt, Germany). The emission bandwidth was set to 10 nm. Fluorescence
emission decays were recorded at 355 nm with a bin size of 25 ps until
a peak photon count number of 10’000 was reached. Excitation
and emission were polarized at 0° and 54.7° (i.e., the magic
angle), respectively, if not stated otherwise. Instrument response
functions were obtained by measuring light scattered by Ludox dispersion
with the emission wavelength set to the excitation wavelength. All
samples exhibited low optical densities of ∼0.1 or less, thus
avoiding issues due to the inner-filter effect. Analysis of fluorescence
emission and anisotropy decays was performed with the software FluoFit
(PicoQuant). Models and equations used are described in the Supporting
Information (eqs S1–S15).

In all cases, fluorescence decays were fitted very well on the assumption
of three lifetime components and, therefore, were parameterized using
triexponential fits (eq S1). Fluorescence
decays at an emission wavelength of (355 ± 5) nm were analyzed
to extract intensity-weighted average lifetimes, τ̃ (eq S2).41,42 The latter
were similar for all alkyl maltoside detergents, with values of ∼4.4
ns, but slightly higher for zwitterionic detergents, with 4.8 ns and
4.7 ns for LDAO and DPC, respectively (Table S6).

Time-resolved anisotropy
Anisotropy decays were determined
from fluorescence decays with excitation polarized at 0° and
emission polarized at either 0° or 90° for 300 s each (eqs S3 and S4).

Time-resolved quenching
Fluorescence decays were recorded
in the presence of increasing acrylamide concentration ranging from
0 to 0.25 M with a bin size of 50 ps (rather than 25 ps as for the
other experiments, to reduce the total measurement time in titration
series), one scan per acrylamide concentration, and in the absence
of DTT. In the presence of DTT, the quenching efficiency showed an
unexpected downward curvature when plotted against quencher concentration.
As experiments with the water-soluble Trp analogue, N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide (NATA), showed the same trend
(data not shown), we concluded that this unusual behavior was caused
by DTT, which therefore was omitted from all experiments involving
acrylamide quenching. As the results from time-resolved quenching
were in excellent agreement with those from steady-state fluorescence
spectroscopy and equilibrium denaturant-shielding measurements performed
in the presence of DTT,13 it can be concluded
that dimerization was negligible in the absence of DTT during the
time course of the time-resolved quenching experiments.

Time-resolved
emission spectra
TRES were determined,
analyzed, and interpreted as detailed elsewhere.26 Briefly, fluorescence decays were recorded in the wavelength
range of 310–450 nm with a step size of 5 nm, a bin size of
50 ps, and a data-acquisition time of 300 s per wavelength. Other
settings were as detailed above. Steady-state emission spectra were
recorded across the same wavelength range with the same spectral resolution,
an integration time of 1 s per data point, and excitation and emission
polarized at 90° and 0°, respectively. Each sample was scanned
five times, and steady-state spectra were further processed by averaging
and subtracting the corresponding blank spectrum of a protein-free
detergent solution.
