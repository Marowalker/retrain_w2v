As an example of molecular design
of new polymers, structures and
properties of poly(ethylene thionoterephthalate) (PET[S2]) and the related polymers have been predicted from calculations
of ab initio molecular orbital (MO) theory, rotational isomeric state
(RIS) scheme, and periodic density functional theory (DFT). The MO
calculations were confirmed by NMR experiments and introduced to the
RIS scheme for PET[S2] to yield its configurational properties,
which are compared herein with those of analogous polyester, polythioester,
and polydithioester. Configurational properties of randomly thiono-substituted
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), PET[SzO1–z], were also evaluated as
a function of sulfidity (z). On the assumption that
the crystal of PET[S2] can be expressed as an isomorphic
replacement of the PET crystal, the crystal structure was optimized
by a periodic DFT simulation and its Young’s moduli in the a-, b-, and c-axis directions
were, respectively, evaluated to be Ea = 0.94(7.20) GPa, Eb = 19.58(22.26) GPa, and Ec = 142.1(182.4) GPa, where the parenthetic values are those
of the PET crystal. There is a possibility that properties of PET[SzO1–z]
will be controlled between those of PET and PET[S2] by
adjusting the sulfidity. The potential practical applications of the
polythionoesters are also discussed herein. By purely theoretical
computations, the structures and properties of the not-yet synthesized
polymers were predicted quantitatively; that is, the theoretical molecular
design of new polymers has been achieved.

Introduction
When the primary structure
(constituent atoms and chemical bonds)
of a new polymer is suggested, if one could predict its higher-order
structures and physical properties, it would be considered to be a
molecular design.1 The present study has
aimed at the realization of such a molecular design.

In previous
studies, we investigated conformational characteristics
and structure–property relationships of aromatic polyester
and polythioesters expressed by chemical formulae given in Figure 1: X = Y = O, poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET);2 X = O and Y = S,
poly(ethylene dithioterephthalate) (PETS2);3−5 X = Y = S, poly(ethylene tetrathioterephthalate) (PETS4).3−5 In Table 1, their
conformational characteristics and configurational properties are
summarized. These polymers, because of lack in side-chain motions,
that is, poor in entropic advantages, are hardly soluble in common
organic solvents. PETS2 in particular is insoluble in any
solvent and decomposed at 346 °C without melting.3 This is because its S–CH2–CH2–S spacer mostly lies in extremely stable conformations
(g±tg∓) in both solid and liquid
phases, where t, g+, and g– represent trans, gauche+, and gauche- conformations,
respectively (for the Newman projections, see Figure 10). This nature can be seen from the small
configurational entropy (Sconf) and large
characteristic ratio (⟨r2⟩0 /nl2) (Table 1). Therefore, the rigid polythioester, even
if melted or dissolved, would not acquire sufficient thermodynamic
(entropic) benefit. PETS2 can be prepared by polycondensation
of terephthaloyl dichloride and ethanedithiol (Scheme 1a), whereas PETS4 was difficult
to synthesize (Scheme 1b). The monomer, tetrathioterephthalic acid protected with piperidinium
reacts as it is with 1,2-dibromoethane to yield PETS4,
which is decomposed at 220 °C.3

Figure 1 Polyester (X
= Y = O, PET), polythioester (X = O and Y = S, PETS2),
polydithioester (X = Y = S, PETS4), and polythionoester
(X = S and Y = O, PET[S2]) with terephthaloyl or thionoterephthaloyl
and ethylene groups. The Y–CH2–CH2–Y part is termed “spacer” herein. Poly(ester-thionoester)
(X1 = O, X2 = S and Y = O, PET[SO]) and randomly
thiono-substituted PET, PET[SzO1–z] (z, sulfidity), have also been
treated here.

There are four possible combinations
to position oxygen and sulfur
at the X and Y sites. Of them, this study has dealt with the remaining
polythionoester (X = S and Y = O, see Figure 2); the polythionoester with the O–CH2–CH2–O sequence, being represented
as PET[S2] herein, must also be difficult to synthesize,
because a thione-thiol rearrangement will readily change the −C6H4–C(=S)–O– part to
−C6H4–C(=O)–S–.6−10 However, a SciFinder search for O,O-diphenyl benzene-1,4-bis(carbothioate) (C6H5–O–C(=S)–C6H4–C(=S)–O–C6H5)11 gave a list of
relevant studies, in which the thionoester was mostly prepared with
Lawesson’s reagent12 from diphenyl
terephthalate. Therefore, it may be possible to prepare PET[S2] from PET using Lawesson’s reagent, Belleau’s
reagent,13 or a P4S10-pyridine complex.14 Unfortunately, PET
is insoluble in common thionation solvents, such as toluene, benzene,
xylene, acetonitrile, and dimethyl sulfone. Therefore, solvent-free
reactions using, for example, microwave heating may be usable for
the thionation.15,16 In actual fact, as illustrated
in Scheme 2, a model
compound of PET[S2], O,O’-(ethane-1,2-diyl)dibenzothioate (designated as model SS herein),
was prepared by microwave radiation from ethylene glycol dibenzoate
(EGDB), a model for PET;17 however, the
yield was very low (0.9%) and the major product (yield, 23%) was the
mono-sulfurated compound, 2-((phenylcarbonothioyl)oxy)ethyl
benzoate (termed model SO). Because of these experimental facts, the
microwave heating would not provide fully sulfurated PET[S2] but partially, moreover, randomly sulfurated PET[SzO1–z] (z, sulfidity, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1).

The
bonds are numbered so as
to be consistent with those of polymers (Figure 2). The concepts of (c) forward and (d) backward
directions were employed in the rotational isomeric state (RIS) calculations
on PET[SzO1–z] (See the Section “RIS calculation”).

As mentioned at the beginning,
this study has aimed at the molecular
design of new polymers; the objects are three polythionoesters: (1)
PET[S2]; (2) PET[SO] in which −C(=S)–
and −C(=O)– groups are arranged alternately;
(3) PET[SzO1–z] in which −C(=S)– and −C(=O)–
appear randomly. Conformational characteristics of PET[S2] and PET[SO] have been investigated via molecular orbital (MO) calculations
and NMR experiments on models SS and SO, respectively. Configurational
properties of PET[SzO1–z], including PET[S2] (z = 1) and PET (z = 0), have been evaluated as a
function of z from the rotational isomeric state
(RIS) calculations18−20 with the Bernoulli trial.21,22 Preliminary to the present study, crystal structures of models SS
and SO were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction17 and both molecules were found to lie in all-trans
conformations. It was earlier found that PET23 and its model, EGDB,24 also crystallize
in all-trans structures. On the basis of these facts, crystal structures
of PET[S2] and PET[SO] were predicted via simulations of
density functional theory (DFT) under periodic boundary conditions25,26 and crystalline moduli were evaluated for the optimized structures.

Herein, the conformational characteristics, configurational properties,
crystal structures, and physical properties of PET, PET[S2], PET[SzO1–z], PETS2, and PETS4 are compared with
each other and the effects of oxygen and sulfur positioned at the
X and Y sites on the structures and properties and, furthermore, potential
practical applications of the not-yet synthesized polythionoesters
are discussed to adduce evidence of the molecular design.

Results and Discussion
MO Calculations
Table 2 lists Gibbs
free energies of model SS, model SO, and
EGDB. In model SS, the tg±t conformations are the
most stable followed by tg±g± and
g±g±g±, and all conformers
including g±g∓ (so-called the pentane-effect-like)18 sequences are missing. Model SO has six major
conformers (tg±t, tg±g±, and tg±g∓), whose ΔGk values are close to each
other. Its g±g±t and g±g±g± conformers also show negative
ΔGk’s, and
no g±g∓ pairs appear in bonds 5
and 6. For EGDB, most stable tg±t and tg±g± conformers have similar ΔGk values. However, its ΔGk’s shown in Table 2 are a little different
from our previous ΔGk’s calculated at the MP2/6-311+G(2d,p)//B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)
level2 because the current study has employed
a larger basis set of 6-311++G(3df,3pd) in the MP2 single-point calculations.

From the ΔGk values, bond conformations of the three model compounds were
calculated
and only trans fractions (pt’s)
are given in Table 3 because the gauche fractions can be readily derived from pg+ = pg– =
(1 – pt)/2. The pt value around the C(=S)O–CH2 bond of model SS (model SO) ranges from 0.71(0.80) to 0.83(0.88),
where the data on model SO are bracketed. The CH2–OC(=O)
bond of EGDB (model SO) shows the pt values
of 0.39–0.47(0.31–0.40). On the other hand, all three
models exhibit marked gauche preferences (pt = 0.02–0.07) in the central CH2–CH2 bonds, whose pt values tend to
decrease with solvent polarity because all conformers with gauche
CH2–CH2 bonds except g±g±g± become still more stable in
polar media.

Figure 3 illustrates trans and cis orientations between two
C=X (X = S or O) groups bonded to the same benzene ring. Compared
with the cis orientation, the trans state is, in principle, only slightly
more stable, but the ΔGcis values
are so small (less than 0.1 kcal mol–1) that both
orientations are almost equally populated (pt = 0.50–0.55).

The model
compounds are termed model S–Bz–S (X1 = X2 = S), model S–Bz–O (X1 = S (O) and
X2 = O (S)), and model O–Bz–O (X1 = X2 = O).

In our previous study
on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, [−CH2–CH2–O−]x) and poly(ethylene
sulfide) (PES, [−CH2–CH2–S−]x),27 the natural
bond orbital (NBO) analysis28,29 was carried out and
their conformational characteristics were interpreted
in terms of vicinal bond–antibond (σ → σ*)
and lone pair–antibond (n → σ*)
interactions. As a result, it was found that the central CH2–CH2 bonds of both O–CH2–CH2–O and S–CH2–CH2–S parts essentially possess gauche preferences due to the
σC–H → σC–X* (X = O or S) interaction.
However, the steric repulsion between sulfur atoms of the S–CH2–CH2–S part forces the CH2–CH2 bond into the trans conformation. The sums
of the σ → σ* and n → σ*
stabilization energies of the ttt and ttg± conformations
were estimated to be in the order of ttt > ttg± (O–CH2–CH2–O) or ttt
< ttg± (S–CH2–CH2–S). Consequently,
tg±t are more stable than ttt and ttg± in O–CH2–CH2–O, whereas
g±tg± and g±tg∓ are dominant over ttt in S–CH2–CH2–S. In addition, the interaction between dipole moments
formed in the C–S–C bonds stabilizes g±tg∓ more than g±tg±. For all of the above reasons, the tg±t conformations
are the most stable in O–CH2–CH2–O’s of PET, PET[S2], and PEO and g±tg∓ has the lowest free energy in S–CH2–CH2–S’s of PETS2, PETS4, and PES.

NMR Experiment
Figure 4 shows 1H and 13C NMR spectra
observed from models SS and SS-13C along with the corresponding
simulations, which yielded vicinal coupling constants, 3JC(S)H, 3JHH, and 3JHH′ (see Table 4). In Figure 5, measured NMR spectra of models SO, SO–S-13C, and SO-O-13C are compared with the simulations,
from which four vicinal coupling constants 3JC(S)H, 3JC(O)H, 3JHH, and 3JHH′ were
obtained as in Table 4. Here, 3JC(X)H represents
the vicinal 13C–1H coupling through the 13C(=X)–O–CH2 (X = S or O) bond sequence.

According
to the procedures described in the section “NMR Experiment and Analysis”, the bond
conformations of the spacers of models SS and SO were derived from
the vicinal coupling constants and the obtained pt values are given for the individual solvents and temperatures
in Table 3. The pt values of the CH2–CH2 bonds of all models are in exact agreement with the MO data,
and those for C(=X)O–CH2 bonds are also consistent
with the MO calculations.

It has been well established that
conformational characteristics
of polymers depend on relatively short-range intramolecular interactions
between atoms or groups separated by up to several bonds and that
configurational properties of a given polymer in the unperturbed state
(without the excluded-volume effect) will be evaluated from RIS calculations
using the short-range intramolecular interaction energies that can
be derived from small model compounds with the same bond sequences
as those the polymer includes.18,19 It has been proven
above that the MO energies of model SS, model SO, and EGDB are reliable
enough to be applied to the RIS calculations on PET[S2],
PET[SzO1–z], and PET.

Configurational Properties of PET[S2]
In Table 1, configurational
properties of PET[S2] are compared with those of PET, PETS2, and PETS4. Of them, PET[S2] and PET
have the O–CH2–CH2–O spacer,
in which the tg±t conformations are the lowest in
ΔGk (Table 2): PET[S2], −2.1
to −2.5 kcal mol–1; PET, −1.1 to −1,6
kcal mol–1. Nevertheless, model SS,17 EGDB,24 and PET23 crystallize in all-trans conformations. The S–CH2–CH2–S spacers of PETS2 and PETS4 are most stabilized in g±tg∓ conformations,3,4 which are also crystal
conformations of these two polythioesters and their model compounds.30,31 The marked g±tg∓ stability of
PETS2 results in a large <r2>0/nl2 of 16.7 and a small Sconf of 4.87 cal K–1 mol–1. This is the reason why its melting point would be
higher than the decomposition temperature of 346 °C.3 Around the benzene ring (virtual bond), PET[S2], PET, and PETS2 adopt either trans or cis orientation
coplanar with the benzene plane, whereas PETS4 is forced
by steric hindrance between sulfur atoms to lie in one of six out-of-plane
orientations with similar free energies, and the orientational flexibility,
namely, quasi-free rotation around the benzene ring leads to a large Sconf of 8.9 cal K–1 mol–1.

Dependence of Configurational Properties
of PET[SzO1–z] on Sulfidity
In Figure 6, the
characteristic ratio (⟨r2⟩0 /nl2) and its temperature coefficient
(dln⟨r2⟩0/dT) and configurational entropy (Sconf) of PET[SzO1–z] are plotted against the sulfidity (z). Both
ends, z = 0 and 1, correspond to pure homopolymers,
PET and PET[S2], respectively. The ⟨r2⟩0/nl2 value
monotonously decreases with increasing z. The chain
dimension was calculated with a virtual bond (bond b) (Figure 2), thus being comparable only
with those of polymers including a benzene ring in the repeating unit,
such as PET, PET[S2], PETS2, and PET4. The configurational entropy markedly decreases as z increases. This can be explained as follows: the spacer of PET is
allowed to adopt a number of conformations with similar ΔGk’s, such as tg±t, tg±g±, tg±g∓, g±g±g±, and g±g±g∓, whereas
PET[S2] falls in two very stable states, tg±t (Table 2) and hence
its degree of conformational freedom is restricted, which results
in the small Sconf value and, furthermore,
suggests its high equilibrium melting point32 and poor solubility.

Figure 6 (a) Characteristic ratio (⟨r2⟩0 /nl2), (b)
its temperature
coefficient (dln<r2>0/dT), and (c) configurational entropy (Sconf) of PET[SzO1–z] at 25 °C as a function of sulfidity (z), calculated by the RIS scheme with different Gibbs free
energies: circle, gas; square, benzene; triangle; DMSO. z = 1 corresponds to PET[S2], and z =
0 to PET.

On the other hand, the temperature
coefficient tends to increase
with z. The dln⟨r2⟩0/dT value was found to be related
to the rubberlike property as33−39 1  where f is the tension (f) of a given elastomer
and composed of two terms due to
internal-energy (U) and entropy (S) changes 2  where 3  and 4  with T, V, and L being the absolute temperature, volume,
and length, respectively. Therefore, a large positive Tdln<r2>0/dT value, that is, a significantly positive fU/f suggests that the polymer
may behave like a rubber because fS is always positive. The energy term (fU) reinforces the entropic elasticity (fS). As the polymeric chain is extended (ΔL > 0), the conformational distribution will be shifted from the
stable
tg±t conformations to, for example, a unstable and
extended ttt state (ΔU > 0); thus, ΔU/ΔL ≈ (∂U/∂L)T,V = fU > 0.
The
nature is reflected by a positive dln<r2>0/dT. The PET[S2] chain
shows
an fU/f value of 0.19,
which is comparable to those of cis-1,4-polybutadiene
(0.10–0.17), polydimethylsiloxane (0.13–0.30), and natural
rubber (0.12–0.18).22,36 It is also suggested
that even PET, if it forms a completely amorphous network, has a comparatively
large fU/f value of 0.13. Therefore, it is expected that the amorphous PET[SzO1–z]
network would become more elastic with increasing sulfidity. In a
polar environment, however, this effect may be weakened as the DMSO
data indicate (Figure 6b).

Periodic DFT Calculation
Preliminary to the current
study, we determined crystal structures of models SS and SO by X-ray
diffraction.17Figure 7 shows the two crystallized molecules, together
with EGDB.24 As shown in Table 2, in the gas phase and solutions,
the tg±t states of model SS, model SO, and EGDB are
much lower in free energy than ttt, but nevertheless, all three models
crystallize in all-trans conformations. The crystallized PET chain
also lies in an all-trans conformation, being packed in a triclinic
lattice of space group P1̅.23 On the basis of the above facts, we have made
a hypothesis that the crystal structure of PET[S2] corresponds
to an isomorphic replacement of the PET crystal: the PET[S2] chain also keeps all-trans in a triclinc P1̅ lattice. On the other hand, the C=S and C=O
groups of model SO are not regularly arranged in the crystal and each
is randomly placed at either of two equivalent C=X sites of
the molecule (see Figure 7b).17 For the sake of comparison,
however, the PET[SO] chain was arranged with one-dimensional periodicity
of [-C(=O)C6H4C(=S)OCH2CH2O-]x and packed as an isomorphic
replacement of PET; however, the asymmetric unit corresponds to the
monomeric one and hence the space group has been assumed to be P1.

in all-trans conformations.

The lattice constants and atomic coordinates of PET being set initially,
the PET[S2] and PET[SO] crystals were subjected to the
structural optimization. Consequently, the lattice energies of both
polymer crystals were fully converged. The crystal structures thus
determined are depicted in Figure 8, the lattice constants are given in the figure caption,
and the fractional atomic coordinates are listed in Tables S3 and
S4 (Supporting Information). The intermolecular
close contacts that were detected by the PLATON program41 are explained in the caption of Figure 8. The length of the a axis corresponds to the π···π
distance: PET[S2], 5.750 Å; PET[SO], 4.639 Å;
PET, 4.45 Å.42 The sulfur atom with
a large van der Waals radius seems to extend the chain spacing.

and γ = 120.73°; (b) triclinic cell of space group P1, a = 4.639 Å, b = 6.283 Å, c = 10.779 Å, α

Intermolecular close contacts detected by the PLATON program:41 (a) π···π (Cg···Cg = 5.750 Å), C–S···π (S···π

= 3.839 Å); (b) π···π (Cg···Cg = 4.639 Å), C–O···π
(O···π = 3.498 Å), C–S···π

(C···S = 3.509 and 3.799Å). Cg is the centroid of the benzene ring. For the atomic
positions, see Tables S3 and S4 (Supporting Information).

The stiffness (C) and compliance (S) tensors of the PET[S2] and PET[SO] crystals are given
in Appendix B (Supporting Information).
From the S tensors, Young’s moduli in the a- (Ea), b-
(Eb), and c-axis (Ec) directions were calculated as follows: PET[S2], Ea = 0.94 GPa, Eb = 19.58 GPa, and Ec =
142.1 GPa; PET[SO], Ea = 2.67 GPa, Eb = 21.83 GPa, and Ec = 173.1 GPa; PET, Ea = 7.20 GPa, Eb = 22.26 GPa, and Ec = 182.4 GPa.42 In
general, the O → S replacement tends to reduce the crystalline
moduli in all three axis directions because the larger van der Waals
radius of sulfur expands the crystal lattice and hence interatomic
interactions are weakened. The stiffness along the fiber axis, Ec, which is, in principle, the largest Young’s
modulus of the polymer, was evaluated in the order of PET (182.4 GPa)
> PET[SO] (173.1 GPa) > PET[S2] (142.1 GPa). Figure 9 shows Young’s
modulus
distributions on the plane perpendicular to the c axis. All three plots are seen to form crosses, which exhibit the
maximum in the molecular plane and its normal directions. The cross
shapes are seen to become well-defined and sharp in the order PET
< PET[SO] < PET[S2] because Young’s modulus
in the a′ direction tends to be markedly reduced
in this order, that is, as the a-axis length increases.

The a’ and b’ vectors represent
the orthogonal projections on the plane. The grid spacing corresponds
to 10 GPa.

Possible Applications
As described above, PET[S2] may not be so stiff as PET.
This is because the sulfur atom
with a large van der Waals radius expands the crystal lattice and
weakens interchain attractions, especially the π/π interaction.
This can be seen from the large a-axis length of
5.750 Å and the small Ea value of 0.94 GPa. PET[S2] strongly prefers the
tg±t conformations; the −Uconf value of 1.84 kcal mol–1 suggests
that the crystalline state is of higher energy by −Uconf than the free (amorphous and molten) state
(cf. −Uconf of PET is 1.02 kcal
mol–1).

As mentioned in the Introduction,
it is difficult to synthesize pure PET[S2] in solutions.
Instead, solid-state thionation of PET by microwave radiation with
Lawesson’s reagent15,16 enables us to prepare
partly thiono-substituted PET, that is, PET[SzO1–z]. If the amorphous
phase is susceptible to the thionation, carbonyl-rich (PET crystallites)
and thiocarbonyl-rich (sulfurated amorphous) domains are formed in
the PET[SzO1–z] material.

As illustrated in Scheme 3, the thiocarbonyl unit, C=S, may
act as a cross-linking
site.8 If a radical species attacks and
bonds to the sulfur atom, a carbonyl double bond, C=O, will
be formed via a thione-thiol rearrangement, and, simultaneously, the
fragment terminated by a methylene radical will be left.8,10 If the methylene radical attacks another C=S group or combines
with a different radical species, an interchain cross-linking will
be formed. If sulfur is added together with a vulcanization accelerator,
vulcanized networks may be formed. If the amorphous phase can be plasticized
properly and, consequently, the glass transition temperature could
be reduced as needed, the material will behave as an elastomer because
PET[S2] has the potential ability to behave as a rubber
(the large positive fU/f of 0.19). Such PET[SzO1–z] materials as are composed
of PET-rich (hard), and rubberlike (soft) domains are expected to
be superior in impact resistance.43 Furthermore,
the polythionoesters exhibit a characteristic reddish color. The optical
property will be either an advantage or a disadvantage, depending
on the usage.

Conclusions
Structures
and properties of PET[S2], PET[SO], and PET[SzO1–z]
have been predicted from the MO, RIS, and periodic DFT calculations.
The spacer, O–CH2–CH2–O,
of PET[S2] strongly prefers tg±t conformations,
which results in a small chain dimension (<r2>0/nl2 = 2.05),
a low
degree of conformational freedom (Sconf = 5.02 cal K–1 mol–1), and potential
rubberlike properties (fU/f = 0.19). As the sulfidity, z, decreases, the configurational
properties of PET[SzO1–z] approach those of PET: <r2>0/nl2 = 2.47; Sconf = 7.13 cal K–1 mol–1; fU/f = 0.13. The crystal structure of PET[S2], assuming to
be an isomorphic replacement of the PET crystal, was simulated from
periodic DFT calculations to be a triclinic lattice of the space group P1̅, a = 5.750 Å, b = 6.509 Å, c = 10.726 Å, α
= 96.25°, β = 123.25°, γ = 120.73°, and
density = 1.533 g cm3. The sulfur atom with a large van
der Waals radius (1.80 Å) expands the crystal cell especially
in the a- and b-axis directions.
From the compliance tensor of PET[S2], Young’s moduli
along the a, b, c axes were evaluated to be Ea = 0.94 GPa, Eb = 19.58 GPa, and Ec = 142.1 GPa, respectively, being smaller than those of PET: Ea = 7.20 GPa, Eb = 22.26 GPa, and Ec = 182.4 GPa. The physical properties
of PET[SzO1–z] will be controlled between those of PET[S2] and
PET by adjusting the sulfidity. On the basis of the information thus
obtained, the practical applicability of the polymers has also been
discussed. Here, the structures and properties of the not-yet synthesized
polymers, PET[S2], PET[SO], and PET[SzO1–z], were predicted by
the purely theoretical scheme; therefore, the theoretical molecular
design for new polymers has been accomplished.

Methods
Molecular Orbital
Calculation
Molecular orbital calculations
on model SS, model SO, and EGDB were carried out with the Gaussian09
program.44 For each of all conformers that
can be enumerated under the RIS approximation, the geometrical parameters
were optimized and the thermochemical energies at 1 atm and 25 °C
were evaluated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations
at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level. For the optimized structure, the
electronic energy was calculated at the MP2/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level.
From the MP2 electronic and B3LYP thermochemical energies, the Gibbs
free energy was calculated for each conformer.

It is known that
the MP2 method occasionally overestimates π/π attractions
between aromatic groups.45 When we investigated
conformational characteristics of poly(trimethylene terephthalate)
(PTT) and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT),46 half of the MP3 term was added to the MP2 energy to compensate the
overestimated π/π attractions.47,48 Inasmuch as the benzene rings of PTT and PBT are connected by −O–(CH2)3–O– and −O–(CH2)4–O– chains, respectively, their
adjacent benzene rings can approach and attractively interact with
each other. In contrast, PET has shorter −O–(CH2)2–O– chains, and hence its benzene
rings cannot come close to each other. Therefore, the above correction
is unnecessary for PET. The PET[S2] and PET[SO] chains
and their model compounds include the same −O–(CH2)2–O– part, being free from the close
contacts of benzene rings. Therefore, their conformational energies
were calculated at the MP2/6-311++G(3df,3pd)//B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)
level.

The solvent effects on the MP2 electronic energy were
assessed
by the polarizable continuum model using the integral equation formalism
variant (IEF-PCM).49 The vicinal coupling
constants required for NMR analysis were also calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd)
level.50

Synthesis of Models SS-13C and SO-13C
Models SS and SO were synthesized
from EGDB and Lawesson’s
reagent by microwave irradiation at 500 W for 3.0 min, as described
elsewhere.17 Models SS-13C,
SO-S-13C, and SO-O-13C were similarly synthesized
as illustrated in Scheme 2; EGDB-13C that had been prepared previously2 was used as the starting material. Because models
SO-S-13C and SO–O-13C could not be isolated,
the mixture (model SO-13C) underwent the following NMR
measurements.

NMR Experiment and Analysis
1H and 13C NMR of models SS, SS-13C,
SO, and SO-13C were measured at 500 MHz (126 MHz) with
a JEOL JNM-ECA500 spectrometer
in the Center for Analytical Instrumentation. Each model compound
was dissolved in benzene-d6, chloroform-d, or dimethyl-d6 sulfoxide
(DMSO-d6) placed in a 5 mm glass tube
at a concentration of 0.06 M (model SS’s) or 0.12 M (model
SO’s), and the probe temperature was set at 15, 25, 35, 45,
or 55 °C. The pulse width, flip angle, and relaxation delay were
set equal to 7.25 μs (3.78 μs) and 45° (30°)
and 5.0 s (2.0 s), respectively. The 32 (128) free induction decays
(FIDs) were accumulated for model SS’s, zero-filled, and subjected
to a Fourier transform. For models SO’s, the FIDs were added
up 128 (256) times. Here, the values with and without parentheses
represent the 13C and 1H NMR parameters, respectively.
The NMR spectra thus obtained underwent the gNMR simulation51 to yield chemical shifts and scalar coupling
constants.

The vicinal 13C–1H coupling constants
(3JC(X)H’s) observed
from models SS-13C and SO-13C can be expressed
as a function of trans (pt) and gauche
(pg) fractions around the C(=X)O–CH2 (X = S or O) bond52 5  where the coefficients, JG, JT′, and JG′ (see Figure 10), were calculated from MO calculations at the B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd)//B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)
level to be 1.71, 7.51, and 4.81 Hz for model SS and 1.71, 7.57, and
4.62 Hz for model SO, respectively. By definition, the bond conformations
must fulfill 6  

Figure 10 Rotamers around the (a) O–CH2 and (b) CH2–CH2 bonds with definition of the coefficients
(vicinal coupling constants) used in eqs 5, 7, and 8.

Two vicinal 1H–1H coupling constants
(3JHH and 3JHH′) observed from two methylene units, CHAHA′ and CHBHB′ (for the hydrogen
designation, see Scheme 2 and Figure 10),
are related to pt and pg of the CHAHA′–CHBHB′ bond: 7  and 8  where the coefficients were adopted from those
often used for the O–CH2–CH2–O
bond sequences of ethers and esters: JG = JG′ = JG″ = 2.3 Hz and JT = JT′ = 11.4 Hz.53 The sum of pt and pg that eqs 7 and 8 directly gave were slightly different
from unity. Then, the two values were divided by the sum to satisfy eq 6.

RIS Calculation
The computer program for the refined
RIS calculations18−20 on PET[SzO1–z] (0 ≤ z ≤ 1) was
homemade, coded in FORTRAN, and compiled with Intel FORTRAN Composer
XE. The statistical weight matrices were formulated as written in
Appendix A (Supporting Information). The
geometrical parameters were extracted from the optimized conformers
of models SS and SO (Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information) and EGDB,2 and the Gibbs free energies of Table 2 were used for the conformational
energies.

The polymeric chain of x degree of
polymerization was imaginarily produced, and its C(=X) sites were
assumed to be randomly sulfurated by Bernoulli trials21,22 so as to fulfill a given sulfidity z0: the random numbers distributed uniformly between 0 and 1 were generated
by the subroutine random_number.
If the value was smaller than or equal to z0, the site was assumed to be sulfurated (C=S); otherwise,
a C=O group was put there. These procedures were repeated for
all nc chains included in the ensemble.
As the number of trials, 2x × nc, increases (a repeating unit has two C=X sites),
the sulfidity (z) generated by the software approaches z0. When x = 200 and nc = 100 were chosen, the discrepancies between z0 and z, defined as |z – z0|/z0 × 100 (%), were found to stay smaller than 0.5%;
therefore, x = 200 and nc = 100 were set in all computations. The cis energy and the geometrical
parameters around the benzene ring depend on the combination of X1 and X2 (see Figures 3 and 11): X1 = X2 = S, model S–Bz–S; X1 =
S (O); and X2 = O (S), model S–Bz–O; X1 = X2 = O, model O–Bz–O. The energy
and geometrical parameters of the spacer were chosen, depending on
the X2 and X3 pair: X2 = X3 = S, from model SS; X2 = S and X3 = O, from
model SO (forward direction, see Scheme 2); X2 = O and X3 =
S, from model SO (backward direction); X2 = X3 = O, from EGDB. In such a way, the energy and geometrical parameters
of the models were assigned to all x × nc monomeric units and the super generator matrices
were assembled and multiplied successively from one end to the other
to yield the configurational properties as a function of z.20

The configurational entropy can be obtained from32,54 9  Here, the partition function, Z,
is calculated from 10  where n is the number of
skeletal bonds, J* is the row matrix whose first
element is unity and the others are null, Uj is the statistical weight matrix of bond j, and J is the column matrix filled with
unity. The configurational energy Uconf corresponds to the difference in internal energy between the crystalline
and unperturbed states, derived from2 11  The positive (negative) Uconf means that the crystal conformation is
more stable
(unstable) by −Uconf than the unperturbed
state (melt, amorphous, and Θ solutions).

Periodic DFT
Calculation
Density functional theory
calculations with a dispersion force correction were carried out under
periodic boundary conditions using the CRYSTAL17 program.25,26 The Hamiltonian used here was B3LYP with a dispersion force correction
(DFC). The DFC term (Edisp) is based on
Grimme’s D2 formula55,56 12  where s6 is the
global scaling factor, Nat is the number
of atoms included in the system, C6ij is the dispersion
coefficient for atom pair ij, given by C6ij = (C6iC6j)1/2, and Rij is the distance between atoms i and j. Here, the damping factor is defined as 13  where d represents
the steepness of the damping function and Rr is the sum of van der Waals radii (RvdW) of atoms i and j. All above parameters except RvdW’s
were based on Grimme’s original.55 As Milani et al. pointed out,57,58 however, the following RvdW’s are more suitable than Grimme’s
for, at least, polymer crystals: H, 1.3013 Å; C, 1.70 Å;
O, 1.52 Å. Our previous studies42,59−61 have also confirmed Milani’s suggestion. Of the RvdW values, those of carbon and oxygen are equal to Bondi’s RvdW’s.62 Therefore,
we first examined which RvdW is more appropriate
for sulfur in polymer crystals, i.e., Grimme’s 1.683 Å55 or Bondi’s 1.80 Å.62 As the object of study, we have chosen poly(ethylene sulfide)
(PES, [−CH2–CH2–S−]xFigure 12) because its simple asymmetric unit includes only
four atoms (S, C, and H2) and hence the RvdW value of sulfur must affect the optimized structure
significantly. The lattice constants and atomic positions that were
determined by X-ray diffraction63 were
set as the initial structure and optimized by minimizing the total
lattice energy. In Table 5, the crystal structures due to RvdW’s of 1.683 and 1.80 Å are given and the discrepancy
from the experiment was quantified by two parameters: ΔLC for lattice constants and ΔSC for atomic
positions, which are defined in the footnotes of Table 5. The RvdW of 1.683 Å yielded ΔLC = 0.94% and
ΔSC = 0.011 and that of 1.80 Å gave somewhat
better results, ΔLC = 0.74% and ΔSC = 0.011. The crystal densities were calculated to be 1.432 g cm–3 (1.683 Å) and 1.405 g cm–3 (1.80 Å); the latter is closer to the experimental value (1.410
g cm–3). In general, the RvdW of 1.80 Å yielded more favorable results and hence
has been used for sulfur throughout this study.

which was calculated for sulfur and carbon atoms.

The crystal structures of PET[S2] and PET[SO] were simulated
by isomorphic replacement for the PET crystal: The repeating unit
of PET, whose one (PET[SO]) or two (PET[S2]) −C=O–
oxygen atoms were replaced with sulfur, was initially set as in the
PET crystal23 triclinic cell of space group P1 (PET[SO]) or P1̅ (PET[S2]) and optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level
with a modified Broyden method under default conditions except for
a Fock/Kohn-Sham matrix mixing of 80% and a shrinking factor of 4.26

Figure 12 Crystal structure of poly(ethylene sulfide) (PES) optimized
with RvdW of sulfur = 1.80 Å. As
in the PETS2 and PETS4 crystals, the spacer
of PES also adopts
g±tg∓ conformations that are the
most stable in the free state.27

The stiffness (S) and compliance
(C) tensors were derived from the ELASTCON routine64,65 included in the CRYSTAL17 program. The number of points to derive
the second derivative of the crystalline energy and the strain-step
size were 5 and 5×10–3, respectively. The Young’s
modulus E(l1, l2, l3) in an arbitrary
direction represented with the unit vector (l1, l2, l3) can be calculated from66 16  where suv (u and v = 1–6, Voigt’s notation)
is the element of the compliance tensor.
