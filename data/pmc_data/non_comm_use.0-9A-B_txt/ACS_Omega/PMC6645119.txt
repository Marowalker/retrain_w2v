Perovskites
form an interesting class of photocatalytic compounds
because of their chemical stability and exotic chemistry. Although
barium zirconates have been known for a long time, their photocatalytic
study in the literature is very limited. Herein, we have studied the
effect of structural disorder, oxygen vacancies and carbon dots (CDs)
on photocatalytic activity of BaZrO3−δ (BZO)
hollow nanospheres. High alkaline conditions during hydrothermal synthesis
lead to the formation of disordered states as well as oxygen vacancies
in BZO and create midgap states within the band gap of BZO. The midgap
states further shift its absorption onset toward visible light and
their presence and effects have been proved by ultraviolet–visible
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
and electron spin resonance analysis. A composite that consists of
CDs shows upconversion photoluminescence and charge-carrier transfer
properties to enhance the light absorption of a photocatalyst and
its activity. The photocatalytic efficiency of the compounds were
examined by H2 evolution and the degradation of methylene
blue (MB) dye. In this study, loading of 3 wt% CDs on BZO shows the
highest hydrogen evolution efficiency (670 μmol/h/g) with an
apparent quantum yield of ∼4% and the highest MB dye degradation
efficiency (∼90%) among all synthesized composites. The synergistic
effect of increased visible light absorption along with enhanced photogenerated
charge-carrier transfer efficiency in the presence of CDs and oxygen
vacancies in BZO contributes to the enhanced photocatalytic efficacy
of hybrid nanomaterials under visible light irradiation.

Introduction
To alleviate the rising
energy demand and threats posed by increasing
pollution level, improvement of sunlight-driven photocatalysis is
an encouraging and viable alternative to other conventional energy
sources such as fossil fuels. In order to convert solar energy into
chemical energy, photocatalytic H2 production via water
splitting is highly sought after as it is carbon-neutral, and considered
as the “holy grail” in chemistry, as only water is formed
as the byproduct in its combustion.1,2 Since the seminal
work of photoelectrochemical H2 production from water by
Honda and Fujishima in 1972, a wide range of scientific investigations
have been carried out in the quest for efficient photocatalyst materials.3 Although wide-band-gap metal oxide semiconductors
are extensively used for photocatalytic H2 production owing
to their low cost, easy synthesis process, and tunable morphologies,
they suffer from poor visible light absorption of the solar spectrum.
Among the oxide photocatalysts, perovskite oxides are a class of materials
with intriguing properties such as high thermal and chemical stability,
tunable electronic structure by doping of foreign elements, and so
forth. So far, a large number of perovskite oxide materials such as
SrTiO3, CaTiO3, KTaO3, and so forth
have been reported in photocatalytic H2 production.4 Perovskite oxide materials have general chemical
formula ABO3, where A and B represent a lanthanide or alkaline
or rare-earth metal ion and a transition-metal ion, respectively.
Ideally, perovskite oxides crystallize in the cubic phase with the Pm3̅m space group. In the unit cell
of a cubic perovskite oxide, the larger cation A resides on the corner
of the unit cell, whereas the smaller cation B forms a BO6 unit by residing at the center of the unit cell.5 A typical wide-band-gap perovskite oxide, barium zirconate,
BaZrO3, is a promising material with a wide range of applications
owing to its capability to host a wide range of dopants into its lattice
and its high conductivity value.6,7 Yuan et al. have shown
photocatalytic water splitting using BaZrO3 as a photocatalyst
without the assistance of any cocatalyst.8 Without any crystal defects, BaZrO3 can harvest only
ultraviolet light, which is only 4–7% in the solar spectrum
because of its large band gap. Light absorption ability of such wide-band-gap
materials can be tuned to the visible light by modifying their band
position, thus introducing oxygen vacancies or by doping different
foreign metals or anion dopants into their lattice. Recently, several
reports have proved that oxygen vacancies in oxide semiconductors
can improve the solar light absorption by narrowing their band gap,
thereby reducing the photogenerated charge-carrier recombination probability.9 The probability of electron–hole recombination
can be reduced by the presence of surface oxygen vacancies, which
act as trap states for photoinduced charge carriers.10 Trap states further induce midgap energy levels in the
material and thus allow fine-tuning of the electronic structure. Defect
or oxygen vacancy-mediated photocatalytic H2 evolution
has been reported for several semiconductors in recent literature.9,11 In the year 2010, Zou et al. have shown enhanced photocatalytic
H2 production of BaZrO3 doped with Sn(IV).12 Here, doping of Sn(IV) impurity decreases the
band gap of BaZrO3 by forming an additional impurity level
near the conduction band, thereby changes its charge-carrier excitation
process. Also, Díaz-Torres et al. have shown the shift in absorption
onset of BaZrO3 toward the visible light and enhanced photocatalytic
activity in Bi-doped BaZrO3.13

Since the report on fluorescent carbon nanoparticles, referred
to as carbon dots (CDs) herein, a new class of carbon-based zero-dimensional
(<10 nm) material has gained massive attention in numerous research
areas such as photocatalysis, photovoltaics, sensing, bioimaging,
optoelectronics, and so forth, owing to its ease in synthesis, processing
and functionalization, low cost, low toxicity, high water solubility,
exceptional photoinduced electron transfer ability, high surface area,
and so on.14−20 Because of these properties, CDs have been considered as a suitable
replacement for organic dyes and semiconductor quantum dots.21 CDs show tunable absorbance and luminescence
properties because of their surface modification. Apart from general
downconversion fluorescence properties, where the photoluminescence
(PL) emission wavelength is longer than the excitation wavelength,
some CDs also exhibit special type of optical properties called upconversion
PL or UCPL wherein they emit at a shorter wavelength when excited
at a longer wavelength.22 Owing to its
UCPL properties, CDs can enhance the light absorption of a semiconductor
to a visible or even near-infrared region.23 From preceding works, it has been found that the introduction of
CDs onto a photocatalyst can enhance its light absorption as well
as photogenerated charge-carrier separation.24 To date, there are several reports of enhanced photocatalytic activity
of CD-incorporated photocatalysts, such as enhanced photocatalytic
H2 production by carbon quantum dots/TiO2 composites,25 enhanced photocatalytic rhodamine B dye degradation
by carbon nanodots/WO3 photocatalysts,26 enhanced overall water splitting and dye degradation by
CDs/TiO2 nanotube arrays,27 and
enhanced methylene blue (MB) dye degradation by CDs/BiVO4 composites.28

The catalytic efficacy
of a photocatalyst can be improved by enhancing
its light absorption capability, as the first step in photocatalysis
involves a light-assisted excitation process. Hence, by improving
the light absorbance in the visible region of the solar spectrum and
efficiently separating the photogenerated carriers, the photocatalytic
efficiency of wide-band-gap materials such as BZO could be improved.
From preceding reports, it is known that semiconductor particles with
suitable inner voids can enhance the light absorption by multiple
reflections and scattering of incident light.29 For example, a TiO2 hollow sphere shows superior photocatalytic
efficiency compared to its dense counterpart.30 Therefore, the creation of hollow nanospheres through morphological
modification can enhance incident light absorption. Further, it is
known that carbon-based nanomaterials can pave an efficient way to
channelize the flow of photogenerated carriers owing to their superior
electron-accepting and -transport properties.24 Hence, the photocatalytic efficiency of a semiconductor could be
increased through the design of a composite with a carbon-based nanomaterial.
Herein, we have synthesized CDs and BaZrO3−δ hollow nanospheres by a facile hydrothermal process and their composites,
varying the percentage of CDs by the dispersion method. The best-performing
hybrid photocatalyst has been assessed by the photocatalytic H2 generation rate and MB dye degradation efficiency.

Results
and Discussion
The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern
of CDs is shown in Figure 1A and it exhibits
one broad peak centered at ∼25° and one less-intense peak
at ∼42°, which can be assigned to the (002) and (101)
planes of a highly disordered graphitic carbon, respectively.34Figure 1B shows the PXRD patterns of bare BZO and xC_BZO (x = 1–4) hybrid nanomaterials. It
is well observed that BZO is free from any impurity peaks and can
be indexed to the cubic phase with the Pm3̅m space group (no. 221) [JCPDS file no. 06-0399]. In the
hybrid compounds, we could not find any peak of CDs, which may be
due to a very low content of CDs in the hybrid compounds and high
crystallinity of BZO compared to CDs.28 No PXRD peak shifting has been observed for bare and hybrid compounds,
affirming the phase and structural retention of BZO in the hybrid
compounds.

The presence of different functional
groups in the as-synthesized
CDs is confirmed by its Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis
as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). A broad peak at ∼3150–3750 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching frequency of −O–H
and −N–H, the peak at ∼2940 cm–1 corresponds to the sp2–C–H stretching frequency,
and the two strong peaks at 1650 and 1558 cm–1 could
be because of =C–O stretching and −N–H
bending frequencies of secondary amines, respectively. The different
weak peaks at 1441, 1375, 1291, and 1048 cm–1 could
be attributed to different functional groups such as sp2 carbon, −C–N, and −O–H. The presence
of hydroxyl, amines, and carbonyl groups ensures high solubility of
CDs in water.35 The presence of different
groups such as sp2 carbon, secondary amines, and carbonyl
groups proves the formation of polyaromatic structures during the
synthesis of CDs.36

From the Raman
spectra in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), we notice two different peaks at 1325 and 1548
cm–1, corresponding to the D band and G band, respectively.
The D band appears because of out-of-plane stretching vibration of
sp3 carbon atoms of the disordered states, whereas the
G band arises from in-plane stretching vibration of sp2 carbon atoms inside the ordered aromatic region.37 Hence, as the D band corresponds to the number of disordered
states or defect sites and the G band corresponds to the number of
ordered states inside the CDs, the ratio of peak intensities between
these two bands, that is ID/IG, can give an idea to evaluate the extent of defects
in it.38 Hereafter, fitting these two peaks
by Gaussian distribution, we have found the ratio of ID/IG is 1.17, revealing a
considerable number of defect sites in the as-synthesized CDs.

To investigate the optical absorption profile of CDs, we have analyzed
the UV–visible spectrum of the as-synthesized CDs in aqueous
solution. From Figure 2, it can be seen that the absorption spectrum of CDs consists of
three distinct regions—a strong absorption peak at ∼240
nm, another intense strong peak at ∼340 nm, and a weak and
broad band at around 445 nm extended up to 600 nm. The high-energy
UV absorption at ∼240 nm, less-intense peak at 340 nm, and
the broad band peak extended in the visible region are attributed
to the π–π* transition of sp2-hybridized
carbons, n−π* transition of the carbon lattice, and different
surface states of the surface functional groups in the n−π*
band gap, respectively.39,40 Upon excitation at
340 nm, the aqueous solution shows a strong PL emission peak centered
at 460 nm, which indicates that the CDs are fluorescent in nature.

spectrum and emission spectrum excited at a 340 nm wavelength
of as-synthesized CDs in aqueous solution.

To further investigate the detailed optical properties of
the as-synthesized
CDs, PL studies were performed with variable wavelengths. Figure 3A shows the excitation-dependent
PL spectra of as-synthesized CDs recorded at different excitation
wavelengths (λex) with 40 nm increments from 320
to 480 nm in water. With the increase in excitation wavelength, the
emission maxima progressively shift toward the longer wavelength and
after the excitation wavelength exceeds 360 nm, the emission intensity
decreases. The reason behind the PL of CDs is not fully understood
yet. The excitation wavelength-dependent PL of CDs could be due to
several reasons, such as different size distributions, exciton of
carbons, emissive traps, free zig-zag sites, presence of heteroatoms,
surface defects, and so forth.41,42

spectra of CDs with 40 nm increment. Inset
to (A) is normalized spectra of (A) and (B) upconversion PL spectra
of CDs with 50 nm increments. Inset to (B) is normalized spectra of
(B).

Significantly, apart from strong
PL properties, these as-synthesized
CDs show remarkable upconversion PL properties. Figure 3B shows the PL spectra of CDs when excited
by low-energy light (700–850 nm). It is found that the upconverted
emission is located at 445–500 nm. Here, this upconversion
PL property of CDs could be due to the multiphoton process.19 Hence, the upconversion PL property of as-synthesized
CDs could be useful in designing an efficient photocatalyst with a
wide-band-gap material as a coupling of these CDs onto the photocatalyst
can utilize a wide spectral range.23

Figure 4A shows
the field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM) image
of a BZO hollow nanosphere. The contrast difference between the dark
edge and the light core of the BZO sphere proves the hollow nature
of the spherical nanoparticles. In hydrothermal synthesis, under the
influence of a high alkaline environment, the Ostwald ripening process
drives the formation of hollow spheres.30,43 The formation
of hollow structures can be discussed in several different stages,
such as hydrolysis, nucleation, and growth process, as reported previously.44 In the initial stage of the reaction, precursors
undergo hydrolysis to form corresponding metal hydroxides in aqueous
alkaline condition. With time, the concentration of the metal salts
increases owing to more hydrolysis of metal salts, and at a particular
time and temperature, the solution becomes supersaturated. The reaction
between the metal hydroxides in this supersaturated and hot solution
favors nucleation and forms tiny particulates by suppressing the grain-growth
process. Because of very small size, the particulates have a high
surface energy and agglomerate under the influence of van der Waals
forces to form larger particles with lesser surface energy. This process
of agglomeration continues until an electrostatic barrier layer is
established.45 Hence, BZO forms by hydrolysis
or decomposition of metal hydroxide monomers in the reaction medium.
During the course of the reaction, the dense spheres undergo recrystallization
to form crystalline hollow spheres by the Ostwald ripening process.
In this process, smaller crystallites from the core of the sphere
tend to dissolute more with time and relocate over the larger particles
on the surface of the spherical particles. Outward diffusion of the
smaller particles from the core of a sphere contributes to the edge
thickness, leading to a partial or complete void formation in the
core of the sphere.43 The products are
formed in the spherical shape to minimize the surface energy and owing
to the high concentration of OH– ions in the reaction
medium.46 The formation of the BZO products
can be explained by the following dehydration pathway

hollow nanospheres and (B) high-resolution transmission electron microscopic
image of BZO hollow spheres. The inset to (C) is the fast Fourier
transformed image of the highlighted portion in image (B), (C) shows

portion in image (F), (G) shows the inverse fast Fourier transformed
image of the masked fast Fourier transformed image shown in the inset
to (G) of CDs, and (H) shows the selected area electron diffraction
patterns of as-synthesized CDs.

The dehydration of the supersaturated solution under high
temperature
may retain a fraction of OH– ions and H2O molecules in the structure and thereby form defective crystals,
and the dehydration of the fraction of these retained OH– ions favors the formation of oxygen vacancies in the lattice of
BZO. Figure 4B shows
the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image
of a selected area of BZO, and Figure 4C shows the inverse fast Fourier transformed (IFFT)
image of the masked FFT shown in the inset to (C) of BZO. From the
IFFT image, the interplanar spacing is found to be 0.29 nm, corresponding
to the (110) lattice plane of BZO. The selected area electron dispersion
(SAED) pattern of BZO shown in Figure 4D proves the crystalline nature.

Figure 4E shows
the FETEM images of as-synthesized CDs. CDs are found to be spherical
in shape and of ∼2–7 nm in size and dispersed evenly
without much significant agglomeration. Figure 4F shows the HRTEM image of a single CD, and Figure 4G shows the IFFT
image of the masked FFT shown in the inset to (G). From the IFFT image,
the interplanar spacing is found to be 0.32 nm, corresponding to the
(002) lattice plane of CDs. The SAED pattern of BZO shown in Figure 4H indicates low crystallinity
of as-synthesized CDs.

To further confirm the homogeneous elemental
distribution of CDs
in xC_BZO (x = 1–4) hybrid
nanomaterials, elemental mapping of 3C_BZO was carried out. From Figure
S3A (Supporting Information), it is clear
that all the constituent elements of 3C_BZO are homogeneously distributed.
Figure S3B–F (Supporting Information) proves the presence of elements Ba, Zr, O, C, and N in this hybrid
nanomaterial. Although in TEM analysis, the used Cu grid has a thin
carbon coating, we have found that element carbon is also present
over the BZO nanospheres, which proves the presence of carbon in 3C_BZO.

Among many factors, the efficiency of a photocatalyst is highly
dependent upon its ability to absorb light, as the first step is to
generate photogenerated charge carriers in a photocatalyst. As shown
in Figure 5, the main
absorption peak of BZO is at 230 nm, which can be assigned to band-to-band
transition. A band tail with an absorption extended beyond 400 nm
is observed because of the presence of disordered states or defect
states or oxygen vacancies in the compound, as it is known that the
impurities or defect-state transitions give the band tail in absorption
spectra in semiconductors.47 In the Kröger–Vink
notation, different kinds of structural and electronic order–disorder
states in BZO are represented as [ZrO6]×, , , , where [ZrO6]× denotes the normal six-coordinate
Zr octahedron,  signifies
penta-coordinate Zr with two
electrons,  denotes penta-coordinate
Zr with one unpaired
electron, and  denotes penta-coordinate Zr with no trapped
electrons.48,49 Here, [ZrO6]× denotes normal octahedra and [ZrO6]′ acts as a donor.48,49 In the xC_BZO
(x = 1–4) hybrid nanomaterials, the absorption
onset of the compounds is red-shifted and the band tail absorption
intensity increases in the wavelength range of 350–800 nm with
progressive increase in CD amount. Increased light absorption by a
catalyst can increase the population of photogenerated charge carriers,
which can, in turn, increase their photocatalytic efficiency. Diffuse
reflectance spectra of synthesized CDs cover the whole spectral region,
indicating a small band gap, shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information).

BZO and xC_BZO (x = 0–4)
hybrid nanomaterials.

Surface properties and the core-level electronic structure
of the
constituent elements for CDs, BZO, and 3C_BZO were analyzed using
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data. Figure 6A depicts the XPS survey spectrum of as-synthesized
CDs with three intense peaks at binding energies (BE) of 285.6, 400,
and 531.2 eV corresponding to C 1s, O 1s, and N 1s, respectively,
indicating that the synthesized products are N-doped CDs. Upon deconvolution
of C 1s core-level spectrum of CDs, it could be fitted into three
different peaks at BE of 284.77, 286.16, and 287.83 eV, which are
attributed to aliphatic or graphitic (C–C/C=C), oxygenated
(C–O/C=O), and nitrous (C–N) carbon atoms, shown
in Figure 6B.50 The N 1s core-level spectrum shown in Figure 6C upon deconvolution
shows three peaks at BE of 399.1, 400, and 401 eV, which are attributed
to pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic nitrogen groups, respectively.37,38

core-level, and (C) N 1s core-level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic

Figure 7 represents
the O 1s core-level XPS spectra of BZO and 3C_BZO samples. Asymmetric
peaks of the O 1s spectrum of BZO and 3C_BZO upon deconvolution can
be fitted into two different peaks at BE of 529.3 and 531.5 eV for
BZO and at BE of 529 and 531.2 eV for 3C_BZO. These two O 1s peaks
indicate the presence of two surface oxygen species in the compounds.
The peak at a lower binding energy corresponds to the lattice oxygen
(Olatt.), whereas the peak at a higher binding energy is
due to surface hydroxyl or oxygen adsorbed on the material surface
or organic oxygen moieties (Oads.). This (Oads.) region is also known to be the signature of oxygen vacancies in
a sample.51 The number of oxygen vacancies
in a compound can be evaluated by calculating the relative peak area
ratio of Oads./Olatt..51 The value of peak area, relative peak area ratio, and peak position
of Olatt. and Oads. are tabulated in Table 1. From Table 1, we can see that the value
of the relative peak area ratio of Oads./Olatt. for 3C_BZO is much higher (1.69) than that for BZO (0.92), indicative
of increased oxygen vacancies with the incorporation of CDs onto BZO.
To get a clear insight into how CDs increase the number of oxygen
vacancies in the hybrid material, we have also analyzed the O 1s core-level
XPS spectrum of CDs. Figure S5 (Supporting Information) shows the O 1s spectrum of CDs, deconvoluted into two asymmetric
peaks with a calculated Oads./Olatt. value of
0.58. Hence, it is clear that some surface organic groups attached
to CDs may also suffer from oxygen vacancies. Incorporation of CDs
onto BZO nanospheres thus increases the amount of oxygen vacancies
in the hybrid nanomaterials. This phenomenon explains the reason behind
an increase in the intensity of the band tail absorption peak of hybrid
compounds, as seen in Figure 5.

and 3C_BZO.

The oxidation
states of Ba and Zr have been assessed from Ba 3d
and Zr 3d core-level spectra of BZO and 3C_BZO. In Figure 8A, Ba 3d core-level XPS spectra
of BZO appear at BE of 779.5 and 794.8 eV, corresponding to Ba 3d5/2 and Ba 3d3/2, respectively. In case of 3C_BZO,
Ba 3d core-level XPS spectra for Ba 3d5/2 and Ba 3d3/2 appear at BE of 779.4 and 794.7 eV, respectively. The difference
in binding energy between the two peaks (ΔBE) of Ba 3d core-level
XPS spectra for both the compounds is found to be ∼15.3 eV,
indicating that Ba is present in (+2) oxidation state in both the
compounds .52 The asymmetric Zr 3d core-level
XPS spectra of BZO and 3C_BZO are depicted in Figure 8B. Upon deconvolution, we observe three different
peaks at BE of 177.57, 181.56, and 183.93 eV for BZO and at BE of
177.21, 181.09, and 183.46 eV for 3C_BZO corresponding to Ba 4p3/2, Zr 3d5/2, and Zr 3d3/2, respectively.52,53 The binding energy difference (ΔBE) between the two peaks
of Zr 3d core-level XPS spectra for both the compounds is found to
be ∼2.37 eV, which proves the (+4) oxidation state of Zr in
both the samples. An energy shift in the XPS binding energy in CD-modified
BZO hybrid nanoparticles is observed, indicative of a strong electronic
interaction between CDs and BZO.

Figure 8 (A) Ba 3d core-level X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopic spectra
and (B) Zr 3d core-level XPS spectra of BZO and 3C_BZO hybrid nanomaterials.

XPS valence band spectra of BZO
and 3C_BZO hybrid nanomaterials
are shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). From Figure S6 (Supporting Information), it is clear that both the spectra have an identical valence band
edge with a clear band tail. From preceding reports, we know that
in any compound, this band tail in valence band spectra signifies
the presence of a lattice disorder.54 With
the incorporation of CDs onto BZO, we could not notice any shift in
the valence band position of 3C_BZO. Therefore, the enhancement in
light absorption in xC_BZO hybrid nanomaterials could
be explained by the effective electronic transition because of the
presence of midgap states or disordered states and upconversion PL
of CDs.

In our studied systems, the oxygen vacancy is an important
parameter
proposed for controlling photocatalytic activity; hence, it is important
to understand the nature of oxygen vacancies present in BZO and CD-incorporated
hybrid nanomaterials. From literature, it is known that three different
types of oxygen vacancies such as neutral, singly ionized, and doubly
ionized can be present in a compound. Among these vacancies, the number
of trapped electrons present are two, one, and zero in neutral, singly
ionized, and doubly ionized oxygen vacancies, respectively.55 Owing to their different spin states, electron
spin resonance (ESR) technique could be employed to determine the
nature of the oxygen species in these compounds. Among these three
different types of oxygen vacancies, singly ionized oxygen vacancy
gives a strong ESR signal as it has only one unpaired electron, and
neutral oxygen vacancy with two unpaired electrons gives a triplet
in ESR analysis. If the neutral oxygen vacancy has paired electrons,
then it cannot give any ESR signal.55 From Figure 9, we observe that
the BZO and 3C_BZO show a broad peak at around g—tensor
value of 2.005, which is due to singly ionized paramagnetic oxygen
vacancies ().56 Figure S7
(Supporting Information) shows the ESR
spectra of as-synthesized CDs in room temperature, and it shows an
intense ESR signal at g—tensor value of 2.005.
As seen from FTIR and Raman analysis, CDs have nitrous groups, carbonyl
groups, and surface defects on them. Hence, the origin of their ESR
spectra may be due to the presence of unpaired electrons in surface
defects and nitrous or carbonyl groups. Hence, from the UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy study, XPS analysis, and ESR study,
we can say that all the studied compounds have a certain amount of
oxygen vacancies and structural ordered–disordered states in
their structures, which could be beneficial for their photocatalytic
activities.

hybrid nanomaterials at room temperature.

To observe the charge-transfer and charge-recombination processes
in a photocatalyst, PL spectra have been widely used. It is notable
from the PL spectra shown in Figure 10A that upon photo excitation at 256 nm, both BZO and
3C_BZO hybrid nanomaterials emit at 396 nm. Bare BZO has high PL intensity,
which is attributed to the lattice disorder and trap states in BZO.57 In 3C_BZO, the PL intensity at 396 nm drops
significantly. This phenomenon could be owing to the reduction in
photogenerated electron–hole recombination. On introduction
of CDs onto BZO, the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band
of BZO move efficiently to the CD particles as CDs are excellent charge
carriers, thereby preventing their recombination with the photogenerated
holes present in the valence band of BZO.17 Hence, owing to efficient charge transfer, in the hybrid nanomaterials,
a sharp drop in PL indicates decreased recombination, which can in
turn enhance its photocatalytic activity.

at an excitation of 256 nm and (B) time-resolved
PL spectra of BZO and 3C_BZO hybrid nanomaterials at an excitation
of 375 nm and emission observed at 450 nm.

Time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectroscopic analysis was performed
to
further get an insight into the charge-transfer process between BZO
and CDs in the best-performing 3C_BZO catalyst. For comparison, TRPL
was also performed for BZO. The samples were excited at a wavelength
of 375 nm and the emission observed at 450 nm is shown in Figure 10B. PL decay profiles
are fitted with a biexponential function to calculate the exciton
lifetime, ⟨τ⟩. The decay profile exhibits biexponential
decay patterns, which infer multiple processes involved during the
decay of emissive excitons or the radiative transitions. The fitting
parameters (χ2) and detailed spectroscopic results,
exciton lifetimes (τ1, τ2), pre-exponential
factors (α1, α2), and average exciton

From the average lifetime values, a
decrease in average exciton
lifetimes for 3C_BZO is observed compared to BZO. The exciton lifetime
for 3C_BZO (1.49 ns) is found to be lower than that of bare BZO (1.72
ns), indicating the photogenerated electronic interaction and facile
charge transport from BZO to CDs in the hybrid nanomaterials.59

Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production
Photocatalytic H2 evolution from water by xC_BZO (x = 0–4) hybrid nanomaterials under
UV–visible
light and visible light was analyzed in the presence of a 0.25 M Na2SO3/0.35 M Na2S mixture as sacrificial
hole scavenger and is shown in Figure 11. In bare BZO, the valence band maxima and
the conduction band minima are more positive than the H2O/O2 redox potential and more negative than the H2/H+ redox potential, respectively.8 In photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction, a sacrificial
reagent can enhance the catalytic efficiency of a photocatalyst as
the sacrificial reagent (Na2SO3) can trap the
photogenerated holes of the semiconductor and leave the photogenerated
electrons in the conduction band, which in turn decreases the charge-carrier
recombination and thus boosts the charge separation.60,61 The role of the sacrificial reagent (0.25 M Na2SO3/0.35 M Na2S) in the photocatalytic H2 production can be explained by the following equations61 1   2   3   4   5   6  

Figure 11 Rate of photocatalytic H2 production from xC_BZO (x = 0–4) hybrid nanomaterials under
(A) UV–visible light irradiation and (B) visible light irradiation
with a 0.25 M Na2SO3/0.35 M Na2S
mixture as sacrificial reagent.

When the semiconductor is photoexcited by a light with energy
more
than or equal to its band gap energy, electrons are excited to the
conduction band, leaving an equivalent number of holes in the valence
band as shown in eq 1. With a high lifetime and charge mobility, these photogenerated
charge carriers may reach the surface of the semiconductor where they
can undergo redox reactions with the reactants adsorbed onto the semiconductor
surface. As shown in eq 2, electrons can produce H2 by reducing water. The holes
can produce S22– and SO42– ions by oxidizing the sacrificial ions, S2– and SO32–, respectively (eqs 3 & 4).
As described in eq 5,
S2– ions form optically transparent S2O32– ions by reacting with SO32– ions in solution. In this process, colorless
S2O32– ions are formed by
the reaction of S2– and SO32– ions with photogenerated holes, as described in eq 6.

In the present work, the
amount of H2 gas produced by
as-synthesized BZO under UV–visible light irradiation is 290
μmol per hour per gram. Compared to bare BZO, the CD-modified
photocatalysts exhibit superior catalytic activity, inferring the
vital role of CDs in BZO. The improved H2 production efficacy
can be attributed to the enhanced light absorption of the catalysts
in the visible light regime after CD loading and faster charge transfer
to CDs. From Figure 11A, we note that 3 wt % is the optimal CD loading concentration for
the highest amount of H2 gas evolution (670 μmol/h/g),
whereas 1C_BZO, 2C_BZO, and 4C_BZO produce 385, 480, and 405 μmol/h/g
of H2 gas, respectively. The calculated apparent quantum
yield (AQY) of BZO and 3C_BZO is ∼2 and ∼4%, respectively.
It is observed that beyond 3 wt% CDs loading, the H2 gas
production efficacy decreases. This could be due to the presence of
surplus CDs on the surface of BZO, which can effectively block the
active sites for photogenerated charge carriers to react with surface-adsorbed
species.62 These excess CDs then act as
charge-carrier recombination centers, which reduce the photocatalytic
efficiency of BZO. Thus, 3 wt % of CDs loading on BZO is optimal for
efficient photocatalytic activity. A similar trend in photocatalytic
H2 evolution is also found under visible light irradiation
when we use borosilicate glass reactor for photocatalytic experiments,
which is shown in Figure 11B. Under this condition, also 3C_BZO produces the highest
amount of H2 (250 μmol/h/g) from water, whereas BZO,
1C_BZO, 2C_BZO, and 4C_BZO give 87, 139, 222, and 186 μmol/h/g,
respectively. The photocatalytic H2 production efficacy
of these materials under visible light decreases as result of cutting
ultraviolet light by a glass reactor. The role of CDs in photocatalytic
H2 evolution from water by BZO is graphically illustrated
in Scheme 1.

Photocatalytic Dye Degradation
Besides
hydrogen production,
as-synthesized xC_BZO (x = 0–4)
hybrid nanomaterials also show effectiveness in degrading organic
dyes commonly found in industrial wastewater. Here, to examine the
degradation efficiency, we have chosen MB as the model system. Figure 12A shows MB dye
degradation of best performing hybrid catalyst 3C_BZO at pH 13. Monitoring
the peak at 664 nm of MB, the intensity of the peak was suppressed
with time, and within 1 h the intensity reduced to more than 90%.
Degradation efficiency of the catalysts was evaluated by comparing
the initial concentration of the dye (C0) with the final concentration (C) of the dye. Figure 12B shows the degradation
efficiency of xC_BZO (x = 0–4)
hybrid nanomaterials. It has been found that 3C_BZO has the highest
degradation efficiency of ∼90%, whereas degradation efficiency
of BZO, 1C_BZO, 2C_BZO, and 4C_BZO are ∼78, ∼85, ∼89,
and ∼80%, respectively. The enhancement in dye degradation
efficiency of xC_BZO hybrids compared to bare BZO
could be owing to the enhanced light absorptivity and superior charge-transfer
capability of the CDs. The photocatalytic dye degradation process
in BZO_CDs hybrid materials happens via several steps and in the first
step BZO and CDs absorb suitable energy light, which promotes electrons
to their respective conduction bands, leaving holes in the valence
bands. Owing to the superior charge-transfer ability of CDs, photogenerated
electrons from the conduction band of BZO tend to transfer to the
conduction band of CDs and reduce the probability of carrier recombination
between electrons and holes in BZO. Additionally, because of the upconversion
PL nature of the CDs, the emitted shorter wavelength light can also
photoexcite BZO and increase the carrier density in it. In the next
step, these electrons in the conduction bands of BZO and CDs can react
with O2 and form superoxide radical anions in the solution.
Similarly, photogenerated holes can react with water and produce hydroxyl
radicals. These hydroxyl radicals later combine and form hydrogen
peroxide. Finally, these hydroxyl radicals oxidize the dye molecules
and hydrogen peroxide regenerates hydroxyl radicals in the solution
by reacting with superoxide radical anions (Scheme 2).

Conclusions
In
summary, we have synthesized BZO and CDs by facile hydrothermal
synthesis. 1–4 wt % of C_BZO hybrid catalysts are synthesized
by dispersing CDs and BZO together. The synthesized products are found
to be an efficient catalyst for photocatalytic H2 production
and MB dye degradation. Synthesized samples were analyzed with the
help of several analytical techniques and it was found that the presence
of defect states, oxygen vacancies, and the addition of CDs onto BZO
lead to an increment of visible light absorption by the photocatalysts
and owing to the high charge-transfer rate of CDs, the photogenerated
charge-carrier recombination is reduced. We have observed that 3 wt
% CDs loaded onto BZO shows the highest efficiency in both photocatalytic
H2 production and MB dye degradation. The AQY of 3C_BZO
(∼4%) is doubled than that of the BZO (∼2%) under UV–visible
light irradiation. In brief, this work proves that CDs can considerably
enhance the photocatalytic activity of a wide-band-gap material such
as BZO, which provides a facile scheme to develop hybrid materials
that could be utilized in energy harvesting and environmental renovation.

Experimental
Section
Materials
All the chemicals used in the experiments
were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Citric
acid (Merck), ethylenediamine (Merck), zirconium oxychloride octahydrate
(Sigma-Aldrich), barium chloride dihydrate (Merck), potassium hydroxide
pellets (Merck), sodium sulfide (Sigma-Aldrich), sodium sulfite (Sigma-Aldrich),
glacial acetic acid (Merck), and MB (Merck) were used as received.
Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm) was used in all the experiments.

Synthetic Procedures
Preparation of CDs
Water-soluble
CDs were prepared
by following a facile carbonation process via the hydrothermal route.31 Citric acid (2.1 g) was dissolved in 20 mL of
water in a Teflon-made reactor by continuous stirring. After complete
dissolution of citric acid in water, 670 μL of ethylenediamine
was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. This solution was then
placed inside a stainless-steel jacket and kept inside a preheated
electric oven at 200 °C for 5 h. After cooling down to room temperature,
a brownish red solution was filtered through a 0.4 μm syringe
filter to separate larger particles. This filtrate was then dialyzed
using a dialysis bag (Da = 1000) and Milli-Q water for 1 day to remove
unreacted reagents. The water was changed every 4 h. As-synthesized
CDs were collected by drying the dialyzed solution at 80 °C overnight.

Preparation of BZO
Barium zirconate hollow spheres
were prepared by following a modified hydrothermal method.32 The reactions were carried out in a stainless-steel
autoclave with a Teflon liner at 200 °C and autogenous pressure.
Initially, a 20 M KOH aqueous solution was prepared in a round-bottomed
flask. This aqueous solution was kept under constant stirring until
it attained room temperature. Then, a stoichiometric amount of BaCl2·2H2O and ZrOCl2·8H2O were mixed with the as-prepared KOH aqueous solution in a 100 mL
Teflon-made reactor. The solution was vigorously stirred for 1 h and
then sealed inside a stainless-steel autoclave and heated inside an
electric oven at 200 °C for 24 h. The autoclave was allowed to
cool down to room temperature naturally after the reaction. To remove
the impurities, the obtained white precipitate of BZO was centrifuged
and washed several times by water, dilute acetic acid, and ethanol.
Finally, the washed BZO was dried at 100 °C inside an electric
oven overnight.

Preparation of CDs_BZO Hybrid Nanomaterials
To prepare x wt % CDs_BZO (x =
0–4) (hereinafter
referred to as “xC_BZO”) hybrid nanomaterials
with the different weight percentage of CDs, we have taken a certain
amount of BZO in a round-bottomed flask and to it added the calculated
amount of CDs. These compounds were then dispersed in ethanol at 45
°C for 2 h by sonication. By removing ethanol by a rotary evaporator,
we collected the different hybrid compounds.

Photocatalytic
Hydrogen Production Experiment
All photocatalytic
H2 production reactions for water reduction were performed
in a two-neck double-walled quartz round-bottomed flask and in a two-neck
double-walled round-bottomed flask made of borosilicate glass. Water
was constantly circulated through the outer jacket of the reactor
to maintain a constant temperature within the reactor. To prevent
gas leakage during photocatalysis experiments, open ports of the reactor
were sealed with a rubber septum. A 300 W tungsten-halogen lamp (OSRAM,
USA) having emission within 195–1100 nm kept 15 cm apart from
the reactor was used as the light source for photocatalytic experiments.
The catalyst (25 mg) was dispersed in 50 mL aqueous solution of sacrificial
hole scavenging reagents (0.25 M Na2SO3/0.35
M Na2S) followed by purging with pure N2 gas
for 15 min at a flow rate of 0.2 L/min to ensure anaerobic condition
within the reactor. After N2 purging, the reactor was degassed
by a vacuum pump to eliminate air and other gases from it. This process
of purging and degassing was repeated twice. During the light irradiation,
the photocatalyst-suspended solution was constantly stirred to ensure
a uniform light exposure of the photocatalyst particles and prevent
sedimentation of the catalyst. At a fixed time interval, 1 mL gas
from the headspace of the reactor was collected by a gas-tight syringe
and analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph
with a Molesieve column, thermal conductivity detector, and nitrogen
as the carrier gas). No considerable gas evolution was observed in
the absence of either photocatalyst or light irradiation, which confirms
the role of the photocatalyst in photocatalytic H2 gas
production. Under the same reaction condition, by using the following
equation, the AQYs of the photocatalysts were calculated5  

Photocatalytic
Dye Degradation Experiment
Photocatalytic
MB dye degradation experiments were performed in a 100 mL round-bottomed
quartz flask by illuminating with a 300 W tungsten-halogen lamp (OSRAM,
USA) kept 15 cm away from the reactor. The photocatalyst (50 mg) was
dispersed in 50 mL of 10–5 M aqueous MB solution
for the photocatalytic dye degradation analysis. The pH of the dye
solution was adjusted to 13 by adding the required amount of aqueous
NH3 solution. In order to achieve adsorption–desorption
equilibrium among the dye, catalyst particles, dissolved oxygen, and
atmospheric oxygen, the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes in the
dark. During 1 h light irradiation, 2 mL of solution was collected
from the photoreactor every 15 min. The collected dye solutions were
centrifuged for 5 min to settle the suspended photocatalysts and the
electronic absorption spectra of the supernatant dye solution were
recorded in the range of 200–800 nm. By monitoring change in
absorbance at 664 nm, the degradation of the MB dye was determined.
The photocatalytic degradation efficiency was calculated as follows  where C0 is the
initial MB dye concentration and C is the MB dye concentration in
the filtrates at a certain time after light irradiation.33

Characterization
A Rigaku X-ray
diffractometer (model
TTRAX III) with Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.54056 Å)
as the radiation source at 50 kV of operating voltage and 100 mA of
operating current was used to record the PXRD patterns. A JEOL JEM
2100 microscope was used to carry out the FETEM analysis and elemental
mapping of the compounds at an operating voltage of 200 kV. The UV–visible
diffuse reflectance spectra of the photocatalysts over a wavelength
range of 200–800 nm were measured in a JASCO V-650 spectrophotometer
with an integrating sphere of 150 mm and BaSO4 as an internal
reflectance standard. The absorbance spectra of MB solutions were
measured on a PerkinElmer LAMBDA 25 spectrophotometer. Laser micro-Raman
analysis was carried out in a HORIBA LabRAM HR spectrometer. PL spectra
were recorded in a HORIBA Scientific Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer.
TRPL measurements were performed on a LifeSpec II Edinburgh instrument.
FTIR spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer instrument with KBr
pellet. ESR spectra were measured on an X-band Microwave Unit, JES-FA200
ESR spectrometer at room temperature at 100 G amplitude (χ),
9.444 GHz microwave frequency, and 100 kHz modulation frequency. A
PHI 5000 Versaprob II, FEI Inc. instrument was used to carry out XPS
analysis of the samples. To compensate for the surface charging effect,
all the peaks were referenced with respect to the C 1s spectrum (284.77
eV). All the XPS core-level spectral data were analyzed and quantified
by using XPSPEAK 4.1 software and the background of all XPS spectra
were subtracted by employing the Tougaard background method.
