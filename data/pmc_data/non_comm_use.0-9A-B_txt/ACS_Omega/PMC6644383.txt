Amino acid-based surfactants are
used in academics and industry.
Sodium N-dodecanoyl sarcosinate (SDDS) is such an
amino acid-based surfactant having applications in pharmaceutical,
food, and cosmetic formulations. Although the surface properties of
this surfactant have been studied in the presence of univalent cationic
and anionic salts, there is no report on such solution in the presence
of higher valencies. In this experiment, critical micelle concentration
(CMC) of SDDS from tensiometry, conductometry, and fluorimetry has
been determined. In each case, CMC decreases with increasing salt
concentration. Counterion binding of micelles (β), diffusion
coefficient (D0), and surface properties,
e.g., Gibbs free energy for micellization (ΔGm0), Gibbs
surface excess (Γmax), area of exclusion per surfactant
monomer (Amin), surface pressure at CMC
(πcmc), etc., have been evaluated using methods such
as tensiometry, conductometry, and fluorimetry. The hydrodynamic radius
of SDDS in the presence of different salts was measured by the light
scattering method. Aggregation number and shape of micelle have been
determined by small-angle neutron scattering experiment. The nature
of amphiphilic packing and the aggregation numbers of the assemblies
have also been explored. The results from different experiments have
been rationalized and represented systematically.

1 Introduction
Amino
acid-based surfactants have immense importance in everyday
life, in almost every industrial area and academic research.1−5 These are long-chain N-acyl amino acid-based anionic
surfactants and are soluble in water. These surfactants, having long-chain
hydrophobic group and the carboxylic acid as the hydrophilic head
group, aggregate in aqueous solution and reduce the unfavorable interactions
with water6 due to their amphiphilic nature.
In the International Journal of Toxicology,7 there is a full report on the synthesis, properties, reactivity,
and usages of several N-acylamino surfactant salts.

There are disadvantages of using fatty acid-type surfactants owing
to their tendency to form precipitate in the presence of divalent
cations, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, etc. To avoid precipitation,
the carboxylate groups are modified by introducing some hydrophilic
chains, such as ethoxy and hydroxyl groups, etc. Sodium N-dodecanoyl sarcosinate (SDDS), used in this study, is a modified
dodecanoic acid at the α-position by an amidomethyl (−CONCH3) group. It is used as a component of toothpaste8 as it does not help in the dissolution of tooth
enamel and the inhibitory effect of fluoride on the dissolution process.9 It has several applications in cosmetic formulations
such as hair conditioning agent, as well as foaming and cleansing
agent used in shampoo, shaving, and wash products because of its soft
nature, better biodegradability, antimicrobial property, and stability
toward hard water.10−13 SDDS is nonirritating and nonsensitizing to the human skin, and
it possesses antimicrobial activities.14 It should not be used in such cosmetic products where N-nitrososarcosine, a known carcinogen, can be formed. It is also
used in formulating textile treatment agent. The surfactant is commercially
available as a colorless to slightly yellow liquid, as a 30% aqueous
solution, or as an anhydrous white powder with 97% purity.

There
are limited studies on the growth of micelle in the presence
of di- and trivalent cations,15−17 although studies are on the effect
of mostly unicationic and anionic salts on the different aggregation
properties of conventional surfactants.18−20 Instead of many applications
of SDDS in biological, medicinal, and industrial fields, studies on
its interfacial and bulk properties are limited. There is a report
on the self-aggregation behavior of the aqueous solution of SDDS in
different temperatures, pHs, acidity constants, and conformational
properties by our group in the presence of unicationic and anionic
salts.21 There is an important role of
Mg2+ on the solubilization of cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli by SDDS.22 Considering all of the uses of SDDS both in vivo and vitro,23−25 it is important enough to study the effect of higher valent cations
and anions on the aggregation properties of the surfactant. Here,
for the first time, we demonstrate the aggregation behavior of SDDS
surfactant in the aqueous solution of salts of higher valent cations
and anions. Here, aggregation occurs more rapidly and critical micellar
concentration (CMC) decreases abruptly in the presence of divalent
cations, which are not observed in salts of univalent cation and anion.19 It may be possible to formulate the composition
of different skin care products and toothpaste using SDDS as a component
along with the ions with higher valency, especially Mg2+ and Ca2+, as these cations are essential to human body.
The CMC is measured tensiometrically, conductometrically, and fluorimetrically,
from which average CMC is calculated. Counterion binding of micelles
(β) was calculated from the conductometric plot, and standard
Gibbs free-energy change (ΔGm0) was calculated from β
values. Aggregation numbers, which increase with increasing salt concentration,
have been evaluated fluorimetrically. Diffusion coefficient (D0) was calculated using the Stokes–Einstein
equation and hydrodynamic radius obtained from the dynamic light scattering
(DLS) method. Different surface properties, e.g., Gibbs surface excess
(Γmax), area of exclusion per surfactant monomer
(Amin), surface pressure at CMC (πcmc), etc., have been evaluated using the plot of tensiometry.
The standard Gibbs free-energy change due to adsorption of SDDS was
calculated for each concentration of salt. The micellar shape and
aggregation number of SDDS at a higher salt concentration were determined
by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurement. In fluorescence
quenching technique for determining the aggregation number, DLS measurement,
and SANS measurement, the concentration of SDDS used was much higher
compared to the CMC of SDDS, obtained at each and corresponding salt
concentrations. Higher concentration of surfactant is required for
better sensitivity and accuracy.26

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Critical Micellar Concentration
Different
salts have been used to measure the CMC and other physical properties
of SDDS solution using different techniques at 298 K. The determined
CMC values are close for different techniques, such as tensiometry,
conductometry, and fluorimetry. The CMC data of SDDS in the presence
of different cations and anions are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
CMC has been observed to vary with the sensitivity of the method applied.
However, the trends are found to be independent of methods. In the
γ vs log[SDDS] plot, minima have been observed. As the hydrophobic
part of the surfactant goes toward the surface, H-bonding network
of aqueous medium is destroyed and surface tension decreases up to
a specific concentration, CMC. At and above CMC, micelle is formed,
and at higher concentration of surfactant, the tendency of the formation
of micelle is higher and then surface tension of the whole solution
may slightly increase due to the presence of a higher number of micelles
in the bulk and so minima appear. CMC of SDDS decreases abruptly with
the increase of MgCl2 concentration (Figure 1 and Table 1),27 but in the case of
Na2SO4, the decrease is mild (Figure 2 and Table 2).28,29 The decrease in the
CMC of SDDS in the presence of MgCl2 is similar to that
in the presence of NaCl,13 but the rate
of decrease is abrupt. This fact is due to the higher positive charge
density and bigger size of hydrated Mg2+ compared to Na+.30 Some Na+ ions are
replaced by highly positive Mg2+ ions at the Stern layer
of SDDS micelles. Consequently, CMC decreases due to tremendous stability
and association ability.31−33 At a very high concentration
of MgCl2 (5 mM), there is no break in the κ vs [SDDS]
plot and, that is why, no CMC is obtained from the plot at 5 mM and
above. CMC measurement has been done in other MCl2 (M =
Ca, Sr, and Ba) solutions at 0.1 mM, and the values are found to be
increasing in nature from Mg2+ to Ba2+ (Figure S1 and Table S1). It is due to the fact
that the charge density decreases from Mg2+ to Ba2+. Susan et al. showed the effect of density of charge of hydrated
cations on the micellization of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution.34 The hydration ability35 of the alkali metal cations follows the decreasing order as Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Sr2+ > Ba2+. That
is why, the association capability and stabilizing ability of the
micelle of SDDS decrease from Mg2+ to Ba2+ for
self-association and hence the CMC value increases.36 This trend is followed by the Hofmeister series (Na+ > K+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+).37 In the presence of Na2SO4, the decrease in CMC is less compared to MgCl2; it is
possibly owing to the resultant of two opposite competitive effects
of Na+ and SO42–. Na+ ions have association capability and favor micellization by reducing
the repulsive interactions of pure SDDS monomers, whereas SO42– ions reduce counterions from the Stern layers,
following increase in the repulsive interactions. As a result, in
the presence of SO42– ions, the surfactant
association capability of Na+ decreases. But CMC decreases
sharply with SO42– ions as counterions
in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, as shown by Naskar
et al.28 In a similar way, the fixed salt
concentration of 5 mM has been used to measure the CMC in case of
Na3PO4, Na2S2O3, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate dihydrate (Na2-EDTA),
Na2-succinate, Na2-oxalate, and Na-gluconate
(Table S2). For Na2-EDTA solution,
the CMC value is lower compared to other CMC values. This may be ascribed
to its bolaamphiphilic nature.38,39 CMC and other thermodynamic
parameters of SDDS in different concentrations of MgCl2 and Na2SO4 are given in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
CMC vs [salt] profile is depicted in Figure 3A,B, which also shows the decrease of CMC
of SDDS with increasing [salt].

2.2 Counterion
Binding
Counterion binding
(β) is the fraction of counterion bound to micelle, which was
determined by the slope ratio method conductometrically. The equation
is β = 1 – S2/S1, where S1 and S2 correspond to the pre- and postmicellar slopes.18 The β value decreases with increase in
[MgCl2], which is quite unusual according to the literature.22 Mg2+, being highly positive in nature,
can replace two Na+ ions at the palisade layer of the micelle
(also discussed in the previous paragraph).40 Henceforth, the number of counterions decreases compared to only
aqueous SDDS. As a result, counterion binding (β) decreases
as the concentration of MgCl2 salt increases.15,31,42 When the β value in the
presence of 0.1 mM MgCl2 is compared to that of other salts
MCl2 (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba), a steady decrease in β
value is observed from Mg2+ to Ba2+. This fact
can be attributed to the hydration energy of the cations; lower the
size of the cation, higher is its hydration capacity, and for this,
higher hydration energy cation remains in the palisade layer.42 Arutchelvi et al. discussed the effects of different
divalent cations on the counterion binding of surfactin surfactant
in aqueous solution, and similar results were obtained.43 The trend of β is opposite to the β
values of SDDS in alkali metal cations.21 This is due to the kosmotropic behavior of order-maker of high charged
divalent cations, whereas the monovalent are chaotropic.44

All of the β values determined with
change in the concentration of MgCl2 and at a fixed concentration
of 0.1 mM of other cation-varied salts are listed in Tables 1 and S1, respectively. Changes of β values with [MgCl2]
are given in Figure 3A. With the increase in [Na2SO4], the β
vs [salt] plots are depicted in Figure 3B. In case of increasing [Na2SO4] up to 5 mM, β increases due to better Na+ condensation
at the Stern layer of micelle; but beyond this concentration, counterion
binding (β) decreases due to increasing polarizability of SO42– ions (Figure 4). At a fixed concentration
of 5 mM of Na3PO4, Na2S2O3, Na2-EDTA, Na2-succinate, Na2-oxalate, and Na-gluconate, it has been noted that β
is relatively lower compared to Na2SO4 owing
to the higher polarizability of the anions in the systems (Figure S2 and Table S2).21

mM MgCl2 and 5 mM Na2SO4.

2.3 Interfacial Parameter
The surface
excess of the surfactant SDDS at CMC (Γmax) was determined
from the Gibbs adsorption equation 1  where  is calculated from the slope
of the linear
surface tension (γ) vs log C plot and i is the number of dissociated ions, which is 2 for SDDS.
Other terms have the usual meanings.45−50 The minimum area of the surfactant head group at the saturated monolayer
at the air–water interface (Amin) was calculated from the equation 2  where N is Avogadro’s
number.

In the presence of MgCl2, the Γmax value increases with increase in salt concentration, and
consequently, Amin decreases (Table 1). The higher charge
density of cations, Mg2+, or other alkali metal ions decreases
the electrostatic repulsion of the head groups of SDDS and thereby
reduces the area per headgroup (Amin).15 But for Na2SO4, an opposite
trend is observed with increase in salt concentration (Table 2) due to highly polarizable
SO42– ions. Amin of SDDS at the same concentration of MgCl2 (0.814) and
Na2SO4 (0.933) is larger compared to the same
concentration of NaCl (0.671).21 Other
anions, such as phosphate, thiosulfate, succinate, and oxalate, are
highly polarizable due to high negative charge density, and as a result, Amin values are high.14 The data are given in Table S2.

The standard Gibbs free-energy change due to adsorption is given
by the equation48,49 3  where
πcmc is the surface
pressure and ΔGm0 is the free-energy change due to micellization. Table 1 shows that ΔGads0 values increase with increasing [MgCl2]. The higher negative
value of ΔGads0 indicates the higher efficiency of SDDS to
adsorb at the interface in the presence of MgCl2. Tables 2 and S2 show these values in the presence of other
salts.

The packing parameter P and structural
geometry
have been calculated by the Israelachvili equation33 4  where lc is the
critical chain length, A is the surface area of the
head group, and v is the critical volume of the critical
hydrophobic chain. Both lc and v for a saturated hydrocarbon chain with Cn number of carbon atoms can be obtained from the following
equations49 5   6  Israelachvili’s theory has
suggested
that for spherical assemblies, P ≤ 0.333.
In this study, sarcosinate ended up with P values
much lower than 0.333 at all salt concentrations, concluding that
spherical micelles were formed in all of the cases. This gets support
as ionic surfactants in general are reported to form spherical assemblies
close to their CMC values.

2.4 Energy of Micellization
The energy
of micellization, Gibbs free energy (ΔGm0), is given by
the following equation based on counterion binding (β) and Xcmc. CMC is expressed in mole fraction scale
as50,51 7  where R is the universal
gas constant and T is the temperature in absolute
scale. In each case, it has been observed that the energy change is
quite highly negative and comparable to each other. The ΔGm0 value increases with an increase in the concentration of both MgCl2 and Na2SO4 (Tables 1 and 2) owing to decreasing
β value, denoting less spontaneity of the micellization process.
The negative values of ΔGm0 indicate the spontaneity of the
micellization process as it was seen in case of NaCl-type salt.21 In higher concentration of MgCl2,
free-energy change cannot be evaluated due to lack of β value.
A similar change in ΔGm0 of SDS in the presence of Al(NO3)3 was
observed by Pereira et al.41 The negative
value of ΔGm0 is higher for SDDS in 5 mM Na2SO4 compared to SDDS in 5 mM NaCl,21 but lower compared to SDS at the same NaCl concentration.42 For other salts, the ΔGm0 value does
not change much (Tables S1 and S2).

2.5 Aggregation Number, Stern–Volmer Quenching
Constant, and Micropolarity
Aggregation number (Nagg), the number of surfactant molecules associated in
the CMC, can be determined by time-resolved fluorescence quenching
method, where the equations52,53 are 8   9  here, It and I0 are the fluorescence
intensities
at time t and 0, after the excitation, respectively;
τ0 is the lifetime of pyrene in micellar environment
in the absence of 1-dodecylpyridinium chloride (DPC); and kq and n are the rate constant
and molar ratio of quencher to micelle, respectively. Using a fitting
program, the fluorescence decay curves are drawn and n values are obtained. The Nagg values
are calculated by eq 9.

The Stern–Volmer equation is used to get the equilibrium
constant (KD) for the interaction of the
pyrene probe with the micelle that determines the bimolecular quenching
and unimolecular decay.6 10  where F0 and F are the fluorescence
intensities of the probe in the absence
and presence of the quencher (Q). In all of the studies, concentration
of SDDS was much greater than CMC. The aggregation number of SDDS
increases from 46 (without salt) to 52 (5 mM MgCl2) (Table 3), and a similar increasing
trend in aggregation number (74 in 1 mM and 92 in 5 mM CaCl2) is observed in the SDS system in the presence of different dicationic
salts.54 The increasing trend of aggregation
number in the presence of salts is because of the increase of SDDS
monomers associated with micelle. There is also a transfer of pyrene
molecules from bulk to micellar region.6,55 There are
also similar aggregation numbers in other salts (MCl2,
M = Ca and Ba) (Table S3). In case of Na2SO4, there is also increase in aggregation number,
but the rate of increase is less compared to MgCl2. Aggregation
numbers have been calculated also in the case of anionic polarizable
anions (PO43–, S2O32–, and EDTA2–). A linear plot
of F0/F vs [Q] gives
one kind of quenching process in the interacting systems. There is
no change in absorption intensity of pyrene when quencher is added
to the probe–SDDS micelle and time-resolved lifetime (τ)
changes with the addition of quencher in such a way that  relation followed.56 These facts prove the dynamic nature of quenching.
The Stern–Volmer
rate constant (KD) also increases with
increasing both [MgCl2] and [Na2SO4]. This is owing to the increase in solubilization of both pyrene
and quencher in the micellar region. Partition coefficient K has been calculated from the relation given below57 11  where I, Imax, and Imin are fluorescence
intensities of pyrene at intermediate, final, and no concentration
of SDDS, respectively, and ρ and α are the density and
core-forming fraction of surfactants, respectively. It has been observed
that K is higher in MCl2 solution compared
to aqueous SDDS (2.65 × 104 M–1),
and there is an increasing order of K with increase
in MgCl2 concentration (3.74 × 104 M–1). With increase in Na2SO4 concentration
(2.95 × 104 M–1 in 25 mM Na2SO4), there is also a trend in increasing the K value, but the value is lower compared to that of SDDS
solution in the presence of MgCl2. Change of K in both MgCl2 and Na2SO4 is consistent
with the change in aggregation numbers and KD.

Local polarity or micropolarity (I1/I3) is an important property because
changes in micropolarity can express structural changes in micellar
aggregates, and this was determined also from steady-state fluorescence
quenching study. Pyrene is used as it is preferentially solubilized
close to the palisade layer of the micelle; the polarity of the probe
senses the level of water penetration in this region of the micelle.58 All KD, N, and I1/I3 values for SDDS–MgCl2 and SDDS–Na2SO4 systems are presented in Table 3. There are plots of I1/I3 values versus concentration
of SDDS in the absence of salt and in the presence of different fixed
concentrations of salts in Figures 1C, 2C, S1D,E, and S2E,F. The I1/I3 value is approximately 1.5 in the absence of SDDS, which
decreases as SDDS is added and becomes constant at and after a certain
concentration of SDDS. The constant value indicated the formation
of micelles, uniform size distribution, and solubilization of pyrene
in the hydrophobic interior of the micelles.51 The I1/I3 values in MgCl2 and Na2SO4 aqueous
solutions are relatively lower (less than unity) compared to the NaCl-type
salt and aqueous SDDS.21 These indicate
the less polar environment of SDDS micelle in the aforesaid salt systems.48

2.6 Hydrodynamic Diameter (Dh), Diffusion Coefficient (D0),
and ζ-Potential (ζ)
The hydrodynamic diameter increases smoothly with increasing concentrations
of MgCl2 and Na2SO447 (Table 4). The hydrodynamic diameter of SDDS in the absence of any salt is
comparable to the values reported in the literature.59 With increasing salt concentration, the number of surfactant
monomers will be higher in micelle and, as a result, the hydrodynamic
radius increases. This trend is similar to the change of aggregation
number. In the presence of 0.1 mM MCl2 (M = Ca, Sr, and
Ba) and 5 mM anionic varied salts (Table S3), hydrodynamic radii are comparable to the values at 0.1 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM Na2SO4, respectively. The
diffusion coefficient of SDDS in different salt concentrations has
been calculated using the Stokes–Einstein equation60,61 12  where η and Rh are the viscosity coefficient and hydrodynamic radius of the solution,
respectively, at temperature T. It has been observed
that the diffusion coefficient of SDDS decreases with an increase
in salt concentration, which follows the opposite pattern to the hydrodynamic
radius. Electrostatic repulsion is higher as SDDS micelle has the
same negative charge on the Stern layer. But, SDDS micelles decrease
the Coulombic potential and the electrostatic repulsion decreases
with increase in salt concentration. For this reason, D0 decreases with increase in salt concentration.62 A similar change in D0 was observed by Mazer et al. for SDS in the increasing NaCl concentration.63 In Table S3, it is
observed that the D0 values of 5 mM anionic
varied salts and 0.1 mM MCl2 (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) are slightly
lower than those of 0.1 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM Na2SO4 respectively.

ζ-Potential (ζ) is the measure of repulsion of the
similarly charged aggregates and stability of the colloidal system.
SDDS forms anionic micelles having Na+ as positive counterions.
A negative ζ is usual for the micellization in the absence of
MgCl2. But, MgCl2 reduces the repulsion between
the micelles for the high positive charge density of Mg2+ and consequently ζ decreases. But, with the increase in Na2SO4 salt, ζ changes slightly due to the competitive
and opposite effects of sodium cation and sulfate anion.42

2.7 Steady-State Fluorescence
Anisotropy and Microviscosity
A steady-state fluorescence
anisotropy measurement furnishes the
information on local viscosity around the probe. The following equation
shows the relationship between two terms6,64 13  Different probes reside in different regions
of the micelle, indicating different microviscosity values. Depolarization
of some probes located in the micelles can also be possible by the
contribution of micellar rotation. A quantitative estimation of changes
in microviscosity at the micellar surface and micellar interior induced
by the addition salt was performed with a fluorescence anisotropy
measurement, using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) probe in micellar
solution of SDDS in different aqueous salt solutions. The fluorescence
anisotropy (r) can be defined as r = (Iv – GIh)/(Iv + 2GIh), and G factor is defined as G = Iv/Ih,
where Iν and Ih indicate the respective fluorescence intensities of the vertically
and horizontally polarized emissions when the sample is excited with
vertical polarized light. The G factor denotes the
ratio of the sensitivities of the detection system between vertically
and horizontally polarized light with fluorescence polarization anisotropy.64,65

DPH is a nonionic and hydrophobic probe that is insoluble
in water. That is why, DPH prefers palisade layer of the micelle.66 In the presence of both types of salts (MgCl2 and Na2SO4), anisotropy values increase,
indicating that more probes come to micellar core from bulk. These
results also indicate stronger probe–micelle interaction in
the presence of salts compared to aqueous micellar solution (Table 5). Table S4 indicates that compared to 0.1 mM MgCl2, both anisotropy and microviscosity values are higher in case of
0.1 mM MCl2 (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba). Again for other anionic
varied salts, anisotropy and microviscosity values are comparable.

2.8 Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS)
SANS
was employed to get the aggregation number of SDDS at different
aqueous salt concentrations. The dimension and shape are also important
parameters of the micelle. Figure 5 shows the fitted SANS profiles (the scattering cross
section (d∑/dΩ) vs accessible wave vector transfer (Q)) for SDDS micelles with salt concentration varying from
0 to 20 mM in case of MgCl2 (Figure 5A) and from 5 to 100 mM in case of Na2SO4 (Figure 5B). The micelles are fitted with the form factor of spherical/prolate
ellipsoidal shape and structure factor, as calculated by the Hayter
and Penfold analysis under mean spherical approximation for charged
microions.67 In this approximation, micelles
are assumed to rigid spheres of equivalent radii σ = (ab2)1/3 interacting through a screened
Coulomb potential. The radius (R) for spherical micelle,
semimajor axis (a), and semiminor axis (b) for ellipsoidal micelle and effective charge (Z) are the fitted parameters. The aggregation number (Nagg = 4πab2/3v, where v is the volume of a surfactant
monomer) and fractional charge α (=Z/Nagg) are the calculated parameters. Through
data analysis, the shape of the SDDS micelle in aqueous and less salt
solution was determined as nearly spherical, but at higher salt concentrations,
the shape is ellipsoidal. With increasing [salt], in the low-Q region, there is a broadening of the peak. The broadening
is greater for Na2SO4 compared to that for MgCl2, suggesting the screening of electrostatic interaction.68 The strength of the repulsive interaction is
set by the surface charge and the ionic strength of the medium. The
addition of a salt increases the ionic strength and hence decreases
the range of electrostatic interactions.60 Due to the high negative charge density of [SO4]2–, the repulsive interaction is more for Na2SO4 compared to MgCl2. At lower concentration
of both types of salts, the micellar shape seems to be spherical as
obtained by packing parameter calculation. But at higher salt concentration,
the shape of micelle tends to be prolate ellipsoidal.69,70 It has been observed that fractional charge decreases with increasing
salt concentration. The aggregation number of micelle increases smoothly
with increasing salt concentration, and these values are consistent
with the aggregation number obtained from steady-state fluorescence
quenching method. All of the fitted parameters are listed in Tables 6 and S5. Aggregation numbers and other values are
more or less comparable for SDDS in the presence of different salts.

3 Conclusions
In the study of aggregation behavior
of SDDS with different salts
of divalent cations and di- and trivalent anions, a number of micellization
parameters have been evaluated. It was observed that N-dodecanoyl sarcosinate interacts strongly with the bivalent cations.
Divalent metal chlorides abruptly reduce the CMC of SDDS due to higher
positive charge density of metal cations, but sodium salts of different
anions reduce the CMC due to the presence of sodium cations. EDTA
shows an exceptional behavior toward the micellization of the SDDS,
owing to its bolaamphiphilic nature. Counterion binding follows an
anomalous trend with increase in the concentration of divalent chloride.
The value of β decreases with increasing the concentration of
divalent metal chlorides, but increases up to 25 mM in case of sodium
sulfate. The energy parameter was found to be highly favorable for
micellization of SDDS in the presence of all salt solutions. In case
of increasing concentration of magnesium chloride and sodium sulfate,
free energy of micellization has the tendency to increase. There are
minor effects of the salts on the micropolarity of the micellar systems.
The aggregation number and the Stern–Volmer quenching constant
were found to increase with increasing both MgCl2 and Na2SO4 salt concentrations. The hydrodynamic diameter
of the micelle increased with an increase in the salt concentration,
whereas the diffusion coefficient decreased. The shape of SDDS micelle
determined from SANS experiment is spherical at low salt concentrations
(as obtained from the packing parameter calculation), whereas it tends
to prolate ellipsoidal at higher salt concentrations. Aggregation
numbers of SDDS were calculated from SANS measurement, which were
similar to those obtained from the time-resolved fluorescence quenching
method. Thus, the surfactant may work well as shampoo, shaving, and
different cleansing and cosmetic products in the presence of hardening
materials in water.

4 Experimental Section and
Methods
4.1 Materials
Sodium N-dodecanoyl sarcosinate (SDDS) (assay ≥97%, HPLC), purchased
from Fluka (Germany) was used as received. The salts MgCl2, CaCl2, SrCl2, BaCl2, Na2SO4, Na3PO4, Na2EDTA,
Na2S2O3, Na2-succinate,
and Na2-oxalate were purchased from Merck (Germany), whereas
Na-gluconate was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 1-Dodecylpyridinium
chloride (DPC) (assay ≥98%) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)
(assay ≥99%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Double-distilled
water (κ = 2–3 μS/cm at 30 °C) was used for
all types of sample preparation. D2O (99.4 atom % D) was received from Heavy Water Division, BARC, Mumbai,
for SANS experiment (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Structure of Sodium N-Dodecanoyl
Sarcosinate
4.2 Tensiometry
To measure the surface
tension (γ), a calibrated Krüss (Germany) tensiometer,
based on the du Noüy platinum ring detachment method, was used
at the air/solution interface of the surfactant solutions at 298 K.
The temperature was controlled by a water bath circulator of accuracy
±0.1 K. A highly concentrated surfactant solution (about 10–15
times the CMC) was added dropwise using a Hamilton microsyringe to
5 mL aqueous solution of salt. A 15 min time interval for equilibration
was given after surfactant addition and thorough mixing during all
such measurements. The CMC values were estimated from the break points
in the surface tension vs log[surfactant] plots.71 The average CMC from three measurements is presented here.
The determined surface tension (γ) values were accurate within
±0.1 mN/m.

4.3 Conductometry
The specific conductance
measurements were taken using a digital conductivity meter (Electronics
India) in a conductivity cell of unit cell constant. The concentrated
solution of surfactant was added to 8 mL of the aqueous salt solution
using a Hamilton microsyringe. A sufficient time was given before
each measurement for thorough mixing and for temperature equilibration.
The CMC values are the mean of three measurements and determined from
the break point in the specific conductance vs [surfactant] plot.
Carpena’s method was used for the determination of break point
(i.e., CMC) and β value at higher ionic strength of salt due
to less abrupt change in conductivity as a function of [SDDS].72 The method has been discussed in detail in the Supporting Information. The temperature of the
experiment was maintained at 298 K by a water bath circulator of accuracy
±0.1 K. The error in measured conductivity was within ±1%.71

4.4 Fluorimetry
Fluorescence
measurements
were taken using a PerkinElmer fluorimeter LS 55 of a 10 mm path length
quartz cuvette. Pyrene was used as fluorescence probe, and its concentration
was around 2 μM. The excitation wavelength was kept at 332 nm,
and emission was taken from 350 to 450 nm. The slit widths were fixed
at 12 and 2.5 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Mean CMC
values of three consecutive measurements are presented in Tables 1 and 2. CPC was used to find Stern–Volmer quenching constants
of different systems.

Time-resolved fluorescence decay was measured
by the time-correlated single photon counting technique in a HORIBA
Jobin Yvon FluoroCube fluorescence lifetime system using a NanoLED
of 330 nm (IBH, U.K.) as the excitation source for pyrene and a TBX
photon detection module as the detector. DPC was used as a quencher
to determine the aggregation number. The decay data were fitted using
IBH DAS-6 decay analysis software. The lamp profile was collected
by placing a dilute micellar solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate in
water as a scatterer in place of the sample. The solution was added
using a Hamilton microsyringe.73

The microviscosity was calculated from the equation involved with
anisotropy measurement by steady-state fluorescence method.6 For fluorescence anisotropy method, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene
(DPH) probe has been used. The excitation and emission wavelengths
were 335 and 436 nm, respectively. The mean value of six consecutive
measurements is presented for all anisotropy measurements. A fixed
temperature (298 K) was maintained by a water bath circulator of accuracy
±0.1 K.

4.5 Dynamic Light Scattering
(DLS)
DLS
measurements have been performed at 173° angle in a Malvern Zetasizer
NanoZS apparatus with a He–Ne laser of wavelength (λ)
632 nm at 25 °C. The sample cells are kept in a temperature-controlled,
refractive index-matched bath filled with cis–trans decahydronaphthalene.
ζ-Potential measurements are taken at 25 and 90° C angle
using a gold-coated copper electrode in the cell. The applied electric
field strength was 80 V/cm. All solutions are filtered two to three
times through Millipore membrane filters (porosity 0.25 μm)
to remove dust particles before the experiment. The mean values of
two repeat experiments are reported.28

4.6 Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS)
Small-angle
neutron scattering experiments were performed using a
diffractometer at the Dhruva reactor, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre,
Trombay, Mumbai. The experiments were conducted with an incident wavelength
of 5.2 Å and a resolution of about 15%. The angular distribution
of scattered neutron was recorded using a one-dimensional position-sensitive
detector. The accessible wave-vector transfer is , where 2θ is the
scattering angle
and the range of diffractometer was 0.017–0.035 Å–1. The samples were held in a quartz sample holder
of 0.5 cm thickness. The temperature was kept fixed at 303 K. The
measured SANS data were corrected and normalized to absolute units
(as cross section per unit volume) using the standard procedure.28 In SANS measurement, the differential scattering
cross section per unit volume (d∑/dΩ) as a function of
wave-vector transfer Q is measured. In the case of
a system of monodisperse particles in a medium 14  where n denotes the number
density of particles, ρp and ρs are,
respectively, the scattering length densities of particle and solvent,
and V is the volume of the particle. P(Q) is the intraparticle structure factor, while S(Q) is the interparticle structure factor. B is a constant term representing incoherent background
scattering, which is mainly due to the hydrogen present in the sample.
The data have been analyzed by comparing the scattering from different
models to the experimental data. The calculation and modeling of different
terms in equations are described in detail in the Supporting Information.
