Detection of cholesterol
and uric acid biomarkers is of great importance for clinical diagnosis
of several serious diseases correlated with their variations in human
blood serum. In this study, a new kind of well selective and highly
sensitive ratiometric fluorescent probe for cholesterol and uric acid
determination in human blood serum was innovatively developed on the
basis of the inner filter effect (IFE) process of nitrogen, cobalt
co-doped carbon dots (N,Co-CDs) with 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP). DAP
was the oxidative product during the oxidation reaction between o-phenylenediamine and H2O2. Fluorescent
magnetic N,Co-CDs possessing blue emission and magnetic property were
prepared through a facile one-pot hydrothermal strategy by using citric
acid, diethylenetriamine, and cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate as precursors.
N,Co-CDs exhibited good ferromagnetic property and excellent optical
properties even in extremely harsh environmental conditions, implying
the huge potential applications of such N,Co-CDs in biological areas.
On the basis of the IFE process between N,Co-CDs and DAP, N,Co-CDs
were applied to establish ratiometric fluorescent probes for the indirect
detection of cholesterol and uric acid that participated in enzyme-catalyzed
H2O2-generation reactions. The established IFE-based
fluorescent probes exhibited relatively low detection limits of 3.6
nM for cholesterol and 3.4 nM for uric acid, respectively. The fluorescent
probe was successfully utilized for the determination of cholesterol
and uric acid in human blood serum with satisfying results, which
provided an informed perspective on the applications of such doped
CDs to explore the specific and sensitive nanoprobe in disease diagnoses
and clinical therapy.

1 Introduction
As a rising star of functional carbon-based nanomaterial family,
carbon dots (CDs) have attracted numerous concerns in biosensing,
cell imaging, and nanomedicine due to their unique photochemical properties,
good photostability, and superior biocompatibility.1,2 Due
to the facile manipulating feature of heteroatom-doped CDs, metal
element-doped CDs become a promising powerful strategy to enhance
the photochemical performances and enlarge the potential application
capabilities of CDs.3−6 Recently, some strategies are developed
to prepare transition-metal element-doped CDs for different biological
applications.7,8 Yao et al. explored magnetofluorescent
CDs for targeted dual-modality cellular imaging and important drug
delivery.9 Jia et al. constructed magnetofluorescent
CDs for bimodal cellular imaging and photodynamic therapy.10 Besides these, magnetic CDs exhibit strong ability
in trapping and extracting pathogenic bacteria and cancer cells from
complicated sample matrixes, showing potential biological applications
in disease diagnosis and cancer therapy.11,12 Due
to the superior biological safety and good magnetic property of Co
element, Co element has been widely selected to dope into CDs for
obtaining fluorescent and/or magnetic CDs for magnetofluorescent dual-modality
bioimaging.8,13 On the other hand, nonmetal N element is
also the frequently used element to efficiently improve the photochemical
property of CDs.14 Although nonmetal N
element and metal Co element exhibit the most preferable influences
on the optical and magnetic properties of CDs and thus on their biological
application performances, synthetic pathways toward fluorescent magnetic
N and Co co-doped CDs (N,Co-CDs) are still rare. As far as we know,
relative biological application of fluorescent magnetic N,Co-CDs in
sensing areas is never reported. It is very necessary to create a
cost-efficient and high-output synthesis strategy for producing fine
fluorescent magnetic N,Co-CDs with superior optical-magnetic property
and explore their photochemical properties and potential applications
in biosensing.

Cholesterol and uric acid are essential and important
biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis of several serious diseases correlated
with their changes in human blood serum.15 A higher amount of cholesterol in blood is usually associated with
nephrosis and diabetes mellitus and so on, but a lower amount of cholesterol
in blood is often related with anemia, hyperthyroidism, Alzheimer’s
disease and so on.16,17 Moreover, an extra high amount
of uric acid in blood is closely related with metabolic disorders
but an extra low amount of uric acid may cause some serious diseases.18,19 Therefore, monitoring of the cholesterol and uric acid levels in
human blood serum is much important for the diagnosis of several serious
diseases. Numerous analytical methods were explored for the detection
of cholesterol and uric acid in different biological samples, including
electroanalysis,20,21 surface plasmon resonance,22 chemiluminescence,23 field effect transistor,24 and liquid
chromatograph.25 Although these methods
can effectively detect cholesterol and uric acid in several samples,
the requirement of expensive equipments and complicated sample pretreatments
limit their applications for simple and rapid determination. So, the
exploration of rapid, economic, sensitive, and effective detection
strategies for the detection of cholesterol and uric acid in human
blood serum becomes a vital public health objective.

Cholesterol
and uric acid can be catalyzed by their specific enzymes to produce
H2O2, so it is possible to develop efficient
strategies for the detection of H2O2 that can
be used for the indirect quantification of cholesterol and uric acid.
More attention has been unremittingly paid to the indirect detection
of cholesterol and uric acid through enzyme-catalyzed H2O2-generation reactions recently,16−19 since such
strategies can avoid influence from coexisting substances. Ratiometric
fluorescence strategy allows the simultaneous measuring of the ratio
variations in two well-resolved fluorescent intensities under one
excitation wavelength.26,27 Such ratiometric fluorescence
measurement can omit the drawback from single fluorescence measurement
efficiently and improve the sensitivity of the fluorescent assay drastically,
resulting in the exploitation of the practical applications of carbon-based
nanomaterials in biological areas.28−30 However, nonmetal element and metal element co-doped
fluorescent magnetic CDs are rarely utilized as ratiometric fluorescent
probes for the detection of cholesterol and uric acid through monitoring
H2O2 amount. Due to the good photochemical properties
of nonmetal element and metal element co-doped fluorescent magnetic
CDs, it is valuable and meaningful to establish doped CD-based ratiometric
fluorescent probes for specific and sensitive detections of cholesterol
and uric acid taking part in enzyme-catalyzed H2O2-generation reactions.

Inspired by such a situation, we innovatively
designed fluorescent magnetic N,Co-CDs as a ratiometric fluorescent
probe for cholesterol and uric acid detections in human blood serum.
As shown in Scheme 1, citric acid (CA), cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O), and diethylenetriamine (DETA) were used as
precursors for the convenient synthesis of fluorescent magnetic N,Co-CDs
through realizable one-pot hydrothermal method for the first time.
Because of the co-doping of nonmetal N element and metal Co element,
N,Co-CDs possess excellent optical properties and good ferromagnetic
property. In the detection process, colorless o-phenylenediamine
(OPD) can be oxidized by H2O2 under the catalysis
of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to produce fluorescent 2,3-diaminophenazine
(DAP). Since the absorption spectrum of DAP can partially overlap
with the emission spectrum of N,Co-CDs, DAP can quench the fluorescence
of N,Co-CDs through the inner filter effect (IFE) mechanism. As a
consequence, an ultrasensitive and highly selective ratiometric fluorescence
universal platform toward cholesterol and uric acid involved in enzyme-catalyzed
H2O2-generation reactions was developed. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first but selective and sensitive
assay for cholesterol and uric acid determination through the IFE
process between fluorescent magnetic N,Co-CDs and DAP, which is identified
as a valuable strategy in biomarker-related disease diagnosis and
clinical therapy.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structure
Characterizations of N,Co-CDs
As illustrated in Figure 1a, N,Co-CDs present
a primary orbicular shape and spread around evenly without obvious
aggregation in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). According to
the statistical analysis of around 200 particles, the sizes of N,Co-CDs
are in the range from 2.0 to 4.8 nm and the average size is 3.37 nm
(insert in Figure 1a), implying the relative smaller size of N,Co-CDs than those of
other reported N-CDs.15,31 These N,Co-CDs possess a clear
lattice structure and a discernible lattice spacing of approximately
0.21 nm (insert in Figure 1a), which is highly consistent with the value of the (100)
planes of graphitic carbon.32 As indicated
in Figure 1b, the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) pattern of N,Co-CDs shows an intense diffraction
peak 2θ at 24.5° that is often correlated with the C(002)
plane and the poor diffraction peak 2θ at 42.5° is assigned
to the C(100) plane, respectively.33 According
to the Bragg equation,34 the interlayer
distance (d-spacing value) can be calculated to be
0.36 and 0.21 nm for the diffraction peaks of C(002) plane and C(100)
plane, respectively, which matches well with the results obtained
from the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM).

distribution curve of N,Co-CDs. (b) XRD pattern of N,Co-CDs.

The structure and functional
groups of N,Co-CDs were continuously characterized by Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). As indicated in Figure 2a, two intense absorption peaks at 3370 and
3058 cm–1 are probably associated with the characteristic
stretching vibrations of O–H/N–H and C–H, respectively.13,15 Three absorption peaks located at 1705, 1647, and 1558 cm–1 are associated with the stretching vibrations of C=O, multiple
=C–H, and C=C bonds, respectively.6,15 Two absorption peaks located at 1428 and 1246 cm–1 are ascribed to the stretching vibrations of C–N and C–O
bonds, respectively.15 The absorption peak
at 1033 cm–1 is ascribed to the stretching vibration
of C–O–C bond.35 All of these
results imply the existences of multiple oxygenated and nitrous functional
groups in N,Co-CDs, suggesting their biological applications in targeted
drug delivery during clinical therapy.

(c) C 1s XPS spectrum, (d) N 1s XPS spectrum, (e) O 1s XPS spectrum,
and (f) Co 2p XPS spectrum of N,Co-CDs.

Detailed surface composition
and elemental contents of N,Co-CDs were investigated by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Figure 2b, the XPS survey spectrum of N,Co-CDs clearly exhibits
characteristic peaks of C 1s at 284.9 eV, N 1s at 400.0 eV, O 1s at
531.8 eV, and Co 2p at 782.5 eV, respectively. High-resolution XPS
spectrum of C 1s is divided into three contributions (Figure 2c), including C=C/C–C
at 284.51 eV, C–N at 285.94 eV, and C=O at 288.99 eV,
respectively.32,36 High-resolution XPS spectrum
of N 1s shows three contributions at 401.55, 400.12, and 398.83 eV
(Figure 2d), which
are attributed to C–N–C, N–(C)3, and
N–H, respectively.31 High-resolution
XPS spectrum of O 1s shows three contributions at 534.33, 532.37,
and 530.45 eV (Figure 2e), ascribing to Co=O, C–O–C/C–OH, and
C=O, respectively.13 From the high-resolution
XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Figure 2f), Co 2p3/2 at 782.80 eV and Co 2p1/2 at 800.60 eV are assigned to its spin–orbit splitting13 and the binding energies of 790.60 and 804.50
eV are ascribed to their shake-up resonance transitions, respectively.
All of these results provide a strong evidence of the existence of
Co2+ ions in the obtained N,Co-CDs backbone.13 According to the result of the elemental analysis,
N,Co-CDs are composed of C 38.90 wt %, H 7.63 wt %, N 18.94 wt %,
Co 8.06 wt %, and O (calculated) 26.47 wt % (Table S1a) and the empirical formula of N,Co-CDs is approximately
C25H56N10CoO12 (Table S1b). All of these results reconfirm not
only the successful doping of N and Co elements in N,Co-CDs but also
the existences of multiple oxygenated and nitrous functional groups
in these N,Co-CDs.

2.2 Optical and Magnetic Properties of N,Co-CDs
As shown in Figure 3a, N,Co-CDs show
an evident UV–vis absorption peak at 240 nm corresponding to
the π → π* electronic transition of aromatic sp2 carbon.15 The typical absorption
peak at 357 nm is assigned to the n → π* electronic transitions
of C=O, C=N, and other bonds in N,Co-CDs, resulting
in these N,Co-CDs emitting strong blue fluorescence under a handheld
UV lamp with 365 nm wavelength (insert in Figure 3a).37−39 These N,Co-CDs emit blue fluorescence according to the Commission
International d’Eclairage (CIE) 1931 2° chromaticity diagram
(Figure S1).40 As further shown in Figure 3b,c, the emission wavelength of N,Co-CDs red-shifts from 435
to 475 nm with the excitation wavelength increasing from 320 to 420
nm, suggesting the emission wavelength-dependent feature of these
N,Co-CDs.41 The maximum excitation wavelength
and emission wavelength of N,Co-CDs are 375 and 465 nm, respectively.
By using the integrating sphere, the absolute fluorescent quantum
yield of N,Co-CDs appearing at 465 nm upon a 375 nm excitation is
calculated to be 71.91%, which is much higher than that of some reported
doped CDs.13,15

wavelength. (b, c) Fluorescence spectra of N,Co-CDs with the excitation
wavelength increasing from 320 to 420 nm. (d) M–H behavior of N,Co-CDs.

The time-resolved fluorescence spectrum
of N,Co-CDs was recorded, and the fluorescent lifetime of N,Co-CDs
was measured according to time-correlated single-photo counting system.
The fluorescent decay traces are well-fitted by the following double-exponential
equation 1  Herein, τi is the
fluorescent lifetime of N,Co-CDs and bi is the normalized pre-exponential factor, respectively. It is clearly
shown in the insert table of Figure S2 that
N,Co-CDs exhibit two fluorescence decay components: τ1 (bi) of 7.39 ns (17.83%) and τ2 (b2) of 13.76 ns (82.17%), respectively.
The average fluorescent lifetime of N,Co-CDs is about 13.10 ns (excited
at 340 nm) (insert table of Figure S2)
that is much longer than that of some reported doped CDs.13,15,42 As further presented in Figures S3–S5, the fluorescence intensity
of N,Co-CDs remains unchanged obviously under long time UV light irradiation
(180 min) or in buffer solution with a wide pH value (3.0–11.0)
and extremely high NaCl concentration (3.0 M). The fluorescence of
N,Co-CDs remains almost constant even after 1 month storage at room
temperature. The excellent photochemical stability of N,Co-CDs under
extremely harsh environment conditions and long time storage promotes
their further application in biological analysis and live cell imaging.

Due to the doping of Co element, the as-prepared N,Co-CDs may possess
magnetic property.8 The magnetic property
of N,Co-CDs was measured at room temperature, and the field-dependent
magnetization (M–H) curve
is shown in Figure 3d. The magnetic hysteresis loop in the M–H curve of N,Co-CDs shows that the these N,Co-CDs exhibit
a ferromagnetic behavior with a saturated magnetization (Ms) value of 1.476 emu/g and a coercive force (Hc) of 9.68 × 103 Oe. Compared
with other transition-metal ion-doped CDs and some hybrid CD nanoconstucts,8,11,12 the Ms value of N,Co-CDs is much smaller, implying the relatively low magnetic
property of these N,Co-CDs. The ferromagnetism behavior of N,Co-CDs
is only attributed to the unpaired electrons and the magnetization
of the doped Co element. The extra low content of Co (8.06 wt %) in
these N,Co-CDs may result in the weak ferromagnetic behavior of N,Co-CDs.
Meanwhile, the spin canting effect in Co atom surface results in the
reduced magnetization of N,Co-CDs. For these N,Co-CDs with smaller
sizes, the magnetization is inclined to decrease at room temperature
after long time storage. Although numerous paramagnetic and super-paramagnetic
CDs are suitable for the magnetic resonance imaging, the ferromagnetic
property of N,Co-CDs makes them potentially applicable for trapping
and extracting pathogenic bacteria and cancer cells in complicated
sample matrixes.

Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded to
calculate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of N,Co-CDs and
N-CDs. CVs were carried out in tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate
solution by using the standard three-electrode system: working electrode
of CDs or N,Co-CDs coated glassy carbon electrode, counter electrode
of platinum wire electrode, and reference electrode of Ag/AgCl electrode,
respectively.43 HOMO and LUMO energy levels
in electronvolt as well as the electrochemical energy gap (Eg in electronvolt) of these CDs can be calculated
according to the following equations43,44 2  Herein, Eox and Ered represent the oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively.
It is clear from Figure S6 that the Ered values are determined to be −0.4064
V for N,Co-CDs and −0.4027 V for N-CDs, respectively. Therefore,
the LUMO energy levels are around −3.99 eV for N,Co-CDs and
−4.00 eV for N-CDs. Due to the irreversible oxidation behavior,
the HOMO energy levels can be calculated indirectly by the following
equations44 3  The optical energy band gap (Eg) is the
absorption edge of the absorption peak (357 nm) of CDs in the UV–vis
spectrum, and Eg is estimated to be 3.61
eV. So, the HOMO energy levels are −7.60 eV for N,Co-CDs and
−7.61 eV for N-CDs. As shown in Figure S7, both the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of N-CDs are approximately
equal to those of N,Co-CDs; thus, the spectral properties of CDs remain
almost unchanged before or after the doping of metal Co element (Figures S8 and S9).

2.3 Fluorescence Detection Mechanism
In this assay, a novel fluorescent magnetic N,Co-CD-based ratiometric
fluorescent probe for the detection of cholesterol and uric acid,
which responded to enzyme-catalyzed H2O2-generation
reaction, was developed. As shown in Scheme 1, CA, CoCl2·6H2O, and DETA are used to prepare N,Co-CDs with emission wavelength
of 465 nm by one-pot hydrothermal method. H2O2, which is the product in the oxidation reactions of cholesterol
and uric acid with O2 under the catalysis of their specific
oxidoreductases (cholesterol oxidase and urate oxidase), can oxidize
OPD to produce DAP with the catalysis of HRP. DAP with emission wavelength
of 540 nm can quench the fluorescence of several carbon-based fluorescence
nanomaterials through IFE.15,29 Therefore, such N,Co-CDs
with excellent properties can be used as the powerful ratiometric
fluorescent probes for indirect detection of cholesterol and uric
acid.

The possible fluorescence quenching mechanism in N,Co-CDs/DAP
system may be probably IFE.45 As seen in Figure 4a, DAP shows a strong
UV–vis absorption peak located at 430 nm and the absorption
spectrum of DAP can partially overlay with the emission spectrum of
N,Co-CDs. Our preliminary results showed that the molar absorption
coefficients of DAP at 375 and 465 nm were about 6.36 × 103 L/(mol cm) and 9.01 × 103 L/(mol cm) whereas
OPD exhibits almost no absorbance at both 375 and 465 nm. These results
suggest the strong absorption ability of DAP and the weak absorption
ability of OPD at these two wavelengths. As a consequence, DAP with
strong UV–vis absorption ability can absorb both the excitation
light and the emission light of N,Co-CDs whereas OPD may not affect
the emission light of N,Co-CDs at all. As indicated in Figures 4b andS10, N,Co-CDs show metal ion, amino acid, and carbohydrate insensitivity.
Obviously, other materials (OPD and HRP) during the enzyme-catalyzed
DAP-generation reaction exhibit no influences on the fluorescence
of N,Co-CDs. Thus, these N,Co-CDs are efficient fluorescence donor
agents in N,Co-CDs/DAP system based on IFE.

and emission spectra of N,Co-CDs. (b) Excitation spectrum of N,Co-CDs

DAP alone (100 μM). (c) Fluorescence decay traces of N,Co-CDs
before and after the addition of DAP. The test was made at the emission
wavelength of 465 nm. τ is the fluorescent lifetime of N,Co-CDs,
and b is the normalized pre-exponential factor.

To further understand
the detailed fluorescence quenching mechanism of N,Co-CDs/DAP system,
the fluorescent lifetimes of N,Co-CDs without DAP were recorded and
the results were displayed in Figure 4c. As exhibited in the insert table of Figure 4c, the corresponding average
fluorescent lifetime of N,Co-CDs with DAP is about 13.24 ns. The fluorescent
lifetime of N,Co-CDs remains almost constant, illustrating that there
is no significant electron or energy transfer process in N,Co-CDs/DAP
system.46 The ζ potentials of N,Co-CDs,
DAP, and N,Co-CDs/DAP system are all positive
(Figure S11), so the nonignorable electrostatic
repulsive force between N,Co-CDs and DAP exists. The distance between
N,Co-CDs and DAP is hardly shorter than 10 nm; thus, the Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) cannot occur in this system.47 All results suggest that the fluorescence quenching
mechanism in N,Co-CDs/DAP system is attributed to IFE rather than
photoinduced electron transfer or Förster resonance energy
transfer (FRET).

2.4 Fluorescence Detection of Cholesterol and Uric Acid
These
fluorescent magnetic N,Co-CDs are used as fluorescent nanoprobes for
the indirect determinations of cholesterol and uric acid through enzyme-catalyzed
H2O2-generation reaction. Before detection,
several important analytical parameters need to be optimized previously:
(a) amount of N,Co-CDs, (b) concentration of OPD, (c) amount of HRP,
(d) pH value of phosphate buffer (3.15 mM Na2HPO4 and 6.85 mM NaH2PO4), (e) incubation temperature,
(f) reaction time, (g) amount of cholesterol oxidase, and (h) amount
of urate oxidase. Fluorescence intensity of N,Co-CDs at 465 nm (I465) and that of DAP at 540 nm (I540) were recorded. According to the ratiometric fluorescence
signal I540/I465 shown in Figures S12–S14, the
following optimal analytical parameters are found to obtain the best
result: (a) 100 μg/mL N,Co-CDs, (b) 5 mM OPD, (c) 10 μg/mL
HRP, (d) pH 6.5 of phosphate buffer, (e) incubation temperature of
37 °C, (f) reaction time of 25 min, (g) 0.05 U/mL cholesterol
oxidase, and (h) 0.06 U/mL urate oxidase.

Under the optimized
analytical parameters (Figure S12), the
fluorescence spectra of the sensing platform were measured in the
presence of H2O2 with the concentration range
of 0.01 μM to 5 mM. As shown in Figure 5a, the I465 value
decreases gradually whereas the I540 value
increases correspondingly with the increasing concentration of H2O2 and the ratiometric fluorescence signal I540/I465 increases
accordingly (Figure 5b). As indicated in the insert of Figure 5b, when the concentration of H2O2 increases from 0.01 to 500 μM, a good linear
relationship exists between the I540/I465 value and the concentration of H2O2 with the linear equation I540/I465 = 0.00477[H2O2] (μM) + 0.1973 (n = 3, correlation coefficient
of 0.9982). The detection limit (LOD) of H2O2 is calculated to be 6.9 nM based on 3σ/K (σ
is the standard deviation of blank measurement, and K is the slope of the calibration graph), which is better than some
existing fluorescence probes for H2O2.15,30 Such a fluorescent magnetic N,Co-CD-based ratiometric fluorescent
probe exhibits ultrasensitive detection of H2O2, implying that this method can be used to detect cholesterol and
uric acid indirectly.

2.4.1 Sensitivity of Cholesterol and Uric Acid Detection
This
fluorescent magnetic N,Co-CD-based ratiometric fluorescence sensing
platform was used for the detection of cholesterol. Under the optimized
conditions (Figures S12 and S13), the fluorescence
spectra of this sensing platform were recorded after adding increasing
concentration of cholesterol from 0.01 to 500 μM. It is shown
that the I465 value decreases whereas
the I540 value increases gradually with
the increasing concentration of cholesterol (Figure 5c). The ratiometric fluorescence signal I540/I465 increases
according to the increment of the concentration of cholesterol (Figure 5d). As further shown
in the insert of Figure 5d, the ratiometric fluorescence signal I540/I465 exhibits a good linear relationship
to the cholesterol concentration in the range 0.01–150 μM.
The linear fitting equation is I540/I465 = 0.01258[cholesterol] (μM) + 0.1767
(n = 3, correlation coefficient of 0.9975), and the
LOD of cholesterol is 3.6 nM based on 3σ/K.

This fluorescent magnetic N,Co-CD-based ratiometric fluorescent
sensing platform was continuously used to detect uric acid. Under
optimized conditions (Figures S12 and S14), the fluorescence spectra of this sensing platform were recorded
after the addition of increasing concentration of uric acid from 0.01
to 300 μM. It is obvious that the I465 value decreases whereas the I540 value
increases gradually with the increasing concentration of uric acid
(Figure 5e). As shown
in Figure 5f, the ratiometric
fluorescence signal I540/I465 increases with the increment of the concentration
of uric acid. Furthermore, the ratiometric fluorescence signal I540/I465 shows a
linear relationship with the uric acid concentration in the range
of 0.01–100 μM (insert of Figure 5f). The fitted linear equation is I540/I465 = 0.01838[uric
acid] (μM) + 0.1672 (n = 3, correlation coefficient
of 0.9984), and the LOD of uric acid is 3.4 nM based on 3σ/K.

Comparing with other reported colorimetry, fluorescence
spectrometry, chemiluminescence, and electrochemical methods by using
other nanomaterials, our method exhibits ultra-wider linear ranges
and relatively lower detection limits for the detections of cholesterol
and uric acid. As shown in Tables S2 and S3, such N,Co-CD-based ratiometric fluorescence sensing platform shows
comparable or even superior sensitivity for the determination of cholesterol
and uric acid. Most importantly, these fluorescent magnetic N,Co-CDs
possessing magnetic property are expediently separated from the detection
system by using the magnet, which makes them reusable during this
detection strategy.

2.4.2 Selectivity and Practicability Investigations
To investigate
the selectivity of this ratiometric fluorescence universal platform
for the detection of cholesterol and uric acid, the interferences
of common ions, amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides, and proteins
on the ratiometric fluorescence signal I540/I465 were studied. As shown in Figure 6, when the concentrations
of cholesterol and uric acid are 50 μM whereas all of the concentrations
of other interferences are 100 μM, these interferences have
no significant influences on the ratiometric fluorescence measurement.
Although these N,Co-CDs are sensitive toward Ag+ and Fe3+ (Figure S10), the interference
of Ag+ on the detection system can be omitted due to the
generation of Ag3PO4 precipitate in the phosphate
buffer. This sensing platform is also insensitive toward Fe3+, which ascribes to the negligible background signal of such a ratiometric
fluorescence strategy by using the ratiometric fluorescence signal I540/I465 as the
detection signal.

Figure 6 Ratiometric fluorescence
signal I540/I465 with various concentrations
of different interferences for the detections of cholesterol (a, b)
and uric acid (c, d). The concentrations of cholesterol and uric acid
were 50 μM, and the concentrations of other interferences were
all 100 μM.

Due to the ultrahigh specificity of the enzyme–substance
reactions, the as-prepared sensing strategy exhibits excellent selectivity
for cholesterol and uric acid determinations. In the proposed sensing
method, enzyme-catalyzed H2O2-generation reaction
is the most important section for detection of signal transformation.
But in real human blood serum samples, the endogenous substances (ascorbic
acid, l-cysteine, and glutathione) can reduce and consume
the produced H2O2 to affect the detection results,
which is vital to the whole strategy. However, when these endogenous
substances coexist in cholesterol and uric acid, the ratiometric fluorescence
signal I540/I465 remains almost constant (Figure S15).
Since the amounts of ascorbic acid, l-cysteine, and glutathione
in real human blood serum samples are much lower than those of cholesterol
and uric acid, the influences of these interferences can be omitted.
These results confirm the good specificity and the potential biological
application of this ratiometric fluorescence sensing approach for
cholesterol and uric acid in real human blood serum samples.

The practicability of this ratiometric fluorescence universal platform
was investigated through detecting cholesterol and uric acid in human
blood serum by using the standard addition approach. As shown in Table S4, the amounts of cholesterol found in
these human blood serum are in accordance with the reported values
(2.86–5.98 mM).48 As indicated in Table S5, the amounts of uric acid found in human
blood serum are in accordance with the reported values (0.12–0.46
mM).19 The recoveries for cholesterol with
three different concentrations (5, 50, and 100 μM) in human
serum samples increase from 95.8 to 103.6%, and the relative standard
deviations are all lower than 1.3% for three replicate measurements.
The recoveries for uric acid with three different concentrations (0.5,
5, and 50 μM) in human serum samples increase from 98.6 to 103.7%,
and the relative standard deviations are all lower than 1.1% for three
replicate measurements. Therefore, this strategy is a promising design
for the detections of cholesterol and uric acid in real samples. All
of the results prove the good selectivity and the super practicability
of such N,Co-CD-based fluorescent probes for biomarker detections
in real biological samples.

3 Conclusions
In summary, N,Co-CDs were prepared
through a simple and convenient one-pot hydrothermal technique by
using CA, CoCl2·6H2O, and DETA as precursors.
Due to the co-doping of nonmetal N element and metal Co element, N,Co-CDs
showed excellent photochemical properties and ferromagnetic property.
On the basis of the IFE process in N,Co-CDs/DAP system, a N,Co-CDs-based
ratiometric fluorescent probe was established for the determination
of cholesterol and uric acid indirectly. The detection limits of cholesterol
and uric acid were 3.6 and 3.4 nM, respectively, which met the requirements
for the highly sensitive monitoring of low levels of cholesterol and
uric acid in human blood serum. The proposed N,Co-CD-based probing
platform is a desirable approach for biomarker monitoring in disease
diagnosis and clinical therapy.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents and Materials
CA, CoCl2·6H2O, DETA, OPD, HRP, uric acid, cholesterol, and cholesterol
esterase were obtained from Aladdin Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). DAP, cholesterol oxidase, urate oxidase, amino acids, and
all other biological substances were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co.,
Ltd. (St. Louis, MO). All chemical reagents were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All reagents were of
the highest commercially available purity and used directly as received.
Ultrapure water with resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was prepared
through Millipore-Q Academic purification system (Bedford).

4.2 Synthesis of N,Co-CDs, and
N-CDs
The fluorescent property of N,Co-CDs can be affected
by the amount of CA, the volume of DETA, the amount of CoCl2·6H2O, the reaction temperature, and the reaction
time. As shown in Figure S16, the optimal
conditions for synthesis of N,Co-CDs were as follows: 2.0 g of CA,
0.07 mL of DETA, 0.4 g of CoCl2·6H2O, 160
°C, and 8 h. Therefore, for the synthesis of N,Co-CDs, 2.0 g
of CA and 0.4 g of CoCl2·6H2O were first
dissolved in 20 mL of ultrapure water and then 0.07 mL of DETA was
added into the above solution. The solution was dissolved completely
by an ultrasonic method for 10 min. Thereafter, the solution was transferred
into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave chamber and reacted
at 160 °C for 8 h. After natural cooling to room temperature,
the solution was collected and dialyzed in a dialysis bag with a cutoff
molecular weight of 500 Da for 72 h. Finally, the outside solution
was collected and concentrated to be about 100 mL under rotary evaporation.
The solid powder of N,Co-CDs was finally obtained via vacuum freeze-drying
for 48 h. This N,Co-CD powder was stored at 4 °C for further
applications. The synthesis and purification processes of N-CDs are
all same as above just without the addition of CoCl2·6H2O.

4.3 Characterizations
of N,Co-CDs and N-CDs
TEM and HRTEM images were taken with
a JEM-2100F high-resolution transmission emission microscope (JEOL,
Japan). XRD spectrum was measured on a Bruker D-8 Advance Powder X-ray
diffractometer (Bruker, Germany). XPS spectra were taken with ESCALAB
250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
FT-IR spectrum was recorded on a Thermo Nicolet iS10 spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Elemental analysis was carried out on
a Vario EL/Micro Cube organic element analyzer (Elementar Analysensysteme
GmbH, Germany). Magnetic property was recorded by using a VersaLab
Vibration Sample Magnetometer (Quantum Design). UV–vis absorption
spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 Plus UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Fluorescence spectra were recorded
on a Thermo Scientific Lumina fluorescence spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Time-resolved fluorescence spectra were measured on a
Horiba Scientific QM-8075 high sensitivity steady-state transient
fluorescence spectrometer (HORIBA, Japan). ζ-Potential was recorded
on a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, U.K.). CV curves were obtained from
a Chenhua CHI-760E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China).
The pH values were mediated using a Sartorius PB-10 pH meter (Sartorius,
China).

4.4 Fluorescent
Sensing of Cholesterol and Uric Acid
For H2O2 detection, 500 μL of 30 mM OPD, 30 μL of 1 mg/mL
HRP, and 70 μL of different concentrations of H2O2 were mixed in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 6.5). The solution
was stored in the dark and incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. Then,
100 μL of N,Co-CD solution (3 mg/mL) was added into the mixture
and the solution was finally diluted to 3 mL with 10 mM phosphate
buffer (pH = 6.5). After additional incubation at 25 °C for 1
min, the fluorescence spectra were recorded under the excitation wavelength
of 375 nm and the ratiometric fluorescence signal I540/I465 was used to detect
H2O2.

For the fluorescent sensing of cholesterol
and uric acid, 500 μL of 30 mM OPD, 30 μL of 1 mg/mL HRP,
100 μL of different concentrations of cholesterol or uric acid,
and 50 μL of 3 U/mL cholesterol oxidase for cholesterol or 60
μL of 3 U/mL urate oxidase for uric acid were mixed thoroughly
in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 6.5). The solution was stored in the
dark and incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. Then, 100 μL of
N,Co-CD solution (3 mg/mL) was added into the mixture. The solution
was finally diluted to 3 mL with 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 6.5).
After additional incubation at 25 °C for 1 min, the fluorescence
spectra were recorded under the excitation wavelength of 375 nm. The
ratiometric fluorescence signal I540/I465 was utilized for the determination of cholesterol
and uric acid.

For cholesterol detection in human blood serum,
500 μL of a human blood serum sample was mixed with 10 μL
of 1 mg/mL cholesterol esterase to hydrolyze cholesterol ester to
produce free cholesterol and then diluted by 100 times by adding 10
mM phosphate buffer (pH = 6.5). For uric acid detection in human blood
serum, the human blood serum sample was diluted by 100 times by adding
10 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 6.5). The diluted human blood serum replaced
with standard samples was measured as described above.
