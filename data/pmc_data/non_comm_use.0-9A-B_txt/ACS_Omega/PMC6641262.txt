Targeted
degradation of individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
(PAH) constituents like anthracene, may offer cost effective and efficient
cleaning of coal tar-contaminated sites. Thus, a reductive degradation
procedure of anthracene using activated magnesium with anhydrous ethanol
at room temperature was developed and optimized. To determine the
optimum conditions for anthracene, such as effective magnesium concentrations,
glacial acetic acid volumes, and exposure time for the anthracene
reduction, the experiments were designed using the response surface
methodology based on the central composite design. The design also
minimized the number of experiments. The main product from anthracene
reduction is 9,10-dihyrdoanthracene. Optimum conditions for 98% degradation
capacity of anthracene (2.80 × 10–3 mmol) were
30 mg of Mg powder (1.20 mmol), 60 μL of glacial acetic acid
(1.05 mmol), and 30 min exposure time. When the optimized method was
tested on the coal tar specimen, twice as many reagents (i.e., Mg
and glacial acetic acid) were required to obtain a 90% degradation
of anthracene and fluoranthene from the coal tar. This method of using
activated Mg and anhydrous ethanol selectively reduces PAHs in coal
tar; in particular anthracene and fluoranthene are most efficiently
removed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of organic
compounds that consist of two or more fused benzene rings. PAHs are
lipophilic and have high desorption activation energy.1 They are colorless to pale solids and have low solubility
in water, high melting and boiling points, and low vapor pressures.2 PAHs are mainly produced from the incomplete
combustion of fossil fuel and organic materials, and the evaporation
of petroleum derivatives.3 Most PAHs do
not easily degrade in the environment and are classified as persistent
organic pollutants. They are also considered as carcinogenic, teratogenic,
and mutagenic.4 The United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has listed 16 PAHs as priority pollutants.5 Seven of these PAHs, namely benz[a]anthrance, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indo[1,2,2-cd]pyrene, and dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, are considered to be carcinogenic compounds.6 Therefore, conversion of PAHs into less toxic
products is one of the strategies in the remediation of PAHs contaminated
sites.7

Catalytic reduction is one
of the methods used for PAHs degradation.8,9 For
example, transition metals (e.g., rhodium, ruthenium, palladium,
etc.) have been successfully used as catalysts in degrading PAHs through
hydrogenation,10−18 but the procedure requires high temperature and pressure of hydrogen
to obtain relatively small nontoxic products. Thus, it is a relatively
expensive procedure of PAH reduction.19 Birch reduction has also been used for PAH reduction, which involves
the use of ammonia and alkali metals such as sodium or lithium.20 However, the Birch reduction has disadvantages,
such as the toxicity of ammonia, difficulty in handling reactive metals,
and scaling up.21,22

Therefore, it is necessary
to find an alternative metal/solvent
system effective for PAH reduction, which is cheap, easily handled,
and environmentally friendly. Magnesium with methanol can be such
a system because it is widely used in several organic synthetic procedures.23 Magnesium with acidified ethanol was successfully
used to remove polychlorinated biphenyls from painted surfaces.24,25 In addition, magnesium with a combined solvent of ethanol and ethyl
lactate (1:1, v/v) was used to reduce some PAHs, such as dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, fluorene, benz[a]anthracene,
9-fluorenone, 7H-benz[de]anthracene-7-one,
7,12-benz[a]anthracenequinone, and 9-fluorenol, from
spiked soil. The degradation was 79–88% of oxygenated PAHs
and 66–87% of PAHs after 24 h of reaction and at room temperature.
To effectively apply such a method in contaminated sites, like the
coal tar contaminant of the defunct steel mill processing plant in
Sydney Nova Scotia, the degradation of PAHs needs to be fast, so that
turnover can be multifold within a day.

In view of this, the
PAH reduction procedure was modified by using
activated Mg as the catalyst to increase degradation turnover. The
Mg was activated by glacial acetic acid with anhydrous ethanol as
a co-solvent to enhance the PAH degradation in coal tar. Therefore,
the objectives of this work were to investigate the ability of Mg
powder activated by glacial acetic acid with anhydrous ethanol to
effect PAHs reduction in coal tar at room temperature and to determine
the optimum conditions for PAHs reduction in coal tar.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Magnesium Activation
Using
a commercial Mg powder without activation was found to be ineffective
for the anthracene reduction, as shown in Figure 1, bar A. In addition, particle size has a
clear effect on the removal efficiency of anthracene, where small-size
Mg particles (≤150 μm) are more efficient for anthracene
reduction (>90% removal efficiency) than Mg turnings (∼50%
removal efficiency), as shown in Figure 1, bars B and C. This is due to the large
surface area of Mg powder that is available for reaction with anthracene
molecules.26 Activation of Mg powder using
glacial acetic acid is a necessary process to remove the formed layers
of magnesium oxide (MgO) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) from the Mg surface. These layers prevent the interaction between
Mg and the substrate (e.g., anthracene).27 Mg activation can be achieved by using methyl iodide or ethyl bromide,
but this method is not favored because a side reaction with the Mg
can occur through the Grignard reagent formation.28 Mercury chloride also can be used, but it is highly toxic.29 Stirring of Mg during the reaction is an important
process and helps to remove the oxide layers and reduces the reaction
time (<1 h), but it is not favored for large-scale reduction using
Mg turnings because the glass reactor can be damaged by abrasion,
whereas slower stirring is not effective with large-scale reductions.30 Acid treatment is another method to remove the
oxidized layers from Mg surface,31 by which
Mg is activated through increasing the active sites on the Mg surface.30 In this work, glacial acetic acid was used as
the activator because it is water-free, which improves the reaction
efficiency, easy to handle, and environmentally friendly.

in anhydrous ethanol at room temperature. (A) Noncatalyzed Mg powder,
(B) catalyzed Mg turnings, and (C) catalyzed Mg powder. The reaction
conditions are 250 ppm anthracene (Ci),
30 mg Mg, glacial acetic acid (30 μL), and 3 h reaction time.
Error bars represent the relative standard deviation (RSD)%, n = 3.

The Mg cleaning using
glacial acetic acid includes the reaction
between the acid and the oxide layers (MgO and Mg(OH)2),
as shown in eqs 1 and 2(27) 1   2  

2.2 Effect of Magnesium with Ethanol
Aprotic solvent (dried
acetonitrile) was used with Mg catalyzed by
glacial acetic acid for anthracene reduction to understand the role
of co-solvent in anthracene reduction, and to compare with anhydrous
ethanol (Figure 2).
The results indicate that ethanol is an essential co-solvent with
catalyzed Mg for anthracene reduction, whereas dry acetonitrile did
not show any efficiency in anthracene reduction. Anhydrous ethanol
works as a proton source, as shown in the reaction mechanism (Scheme 1). In addition, using
anhydrous ethanol as a co-solvent has several advantages, such as
being nontoxic, cheap, and a high ability to extract PAHs. Mg reacts
with anhydrous ethanol to produce hydrogen gas and magnesium ethoxide,
as shown in eq 3. Anthracene
degradation increases with increasing reaction time, where a high
conversion of anthracene (>90%) occurs at time ∼3 h (see
inset
plot in Figure 2). 3  Due to these side reactions shown in eqs 1–3, the amount
of Mg powder (1.20 mmol) and glacial acetic acid
(1.05 mmol) are used in excess compared to the amount of anthracene
used (2.80 × 10–3 mmol). Therefore, the reaction
is not stochiometric.

catalyzed

anthracene degradation using Mg/EtOH as a function of time. The reaction
conditions are 250 ppm anthracene (Ci),
30 mg of Mg powder, and 3 h reaction time. Error bars represent the
RSD%, n = 3.

by Glacial Acetic Acid, Which Is a Modification of Mechanism Earlier
Proposed by Elie28
2.3 Anthracene Reduction Mechanism
Reduction
of anthracene using activated Mg with anhydrous ethanol gives 9,10-dihydroanthtracene
as the main product. A proposed modified mechanism of this reaction
based upon that described by Elie28 is shown in Scheme 1. A single electron transfer (SET) is the
first step in the mechanism, where a single electron transfers from
Mg (the electron donor) to anthracene (the electron acceptor) to form
a radical anion (I) at position 9 or 10 of the anthracene molecule.
Then, (I) is protonated to form the protonated radical (II). The second
electron transfers from Mg to (II) to form anion (III), which in turn
is protonated by ethanol molecules to produce 9,10-didhydroanthracene
(IV).

2.4 Optimization of Anthracene Reduction
The single-factor-at-a-time approach is widely reported in the literature,
in which a single factor is studied and other factors remain constant.32 Nevertheless, that approach is not fully successful
because it ignores the interactions between the factors and requires
many experiments. However, the experimental design methodology reduces
the number of experiments and takes into account the interactions
between the factors.33

2.4.1 Screening
of Variables
The screening
variables of the anthracene reduction using the Mg catalyzed by glacial
acetic acid were achieved using four factors, namely Mg powder dosage,
glacial acetic acid, graphite, and time. Graphite was introduced as
a possible factor since Elie et al. reported a catalytic function
in their experiments.27 Using the data
shown in Table 1, the
significance of each factor was then determined by a Pareto chart
(Figure 3), in which
the significance of each factor is shown to be proportional to the
length of the corresponding line bar. For example, glacial acetic
acid and Mg have a significant effect (p ≤
0.05 at 95% confidence level), having values of 12.12 and 11.00, respectively.
However, graphite has an insignificant effect (p =
0.2199), as shown in Appendix (Table S1). This result was proven by other experiments,
designed to study the effect of the added graphite. For example, experiment
#4 in Table 1 was repeated
with graphite (30 mg), and experiment #8 was also repeated but without
graphite. There is no apparent effect on reduction of anthracene in
both the cases. Therefore, the three factors that have a clear effect
on removal % of anthracene reduction are Mg dosage, glacial acetic
acid, and time. Among them, glacial acetic acid has the highest effect
followed by Mg and time, respectively.

factors (Table 1) effecting
on anthracene reduction using
magnesium activated by glacial acetic acid with anhydrous ethanol

2.4.2 Optimization Using Central Composite Design
(CCD)
The use of response surface methodology (RSM) based
on CCD is widely reported in the literature because it is simple and
easy to use, minimizes the number of experiments, and provides useful
information on the effects of factors and their interactions.34 The experiments achieved for the optimization
of anthracene reduction using activated Mg with anhydrous ethanol
are listed in Table 2. Three factors (i.e., Mg powder, glacial acetic acid, and time)
were studied and each factor has three levels: low (−1), medium
(0), and high (+1). Increasing the Mg dosage increases the removal
% of anthracene. The same trend can be observed when the glacial acetic
acid volume increases. Using the highest Mg dosage and high glacial
acetic acid dosage gave the ability to obtain high removal % of anthracene
during a relatively short time (30 min). The results of analysis of
variance (ANOVA) of the CCD model are listed in Appendix (Table S2), where the p-values of the three factors (Mg powder, glacial acetic
acid, and time) are less than 0.05, which indicate that they have
a clear significant influence on anthracene reduction. In addition, F-values are large and the lack of fit is insignificant,
which leads us to conclude that the model is in a good agreement with
the data used.35 Depending on the ANOVA
analysis, the final mathematical equation, in terms of actual factors,
for removal calculation is as follows (eq 4) 4  The model validity was evaluated
by ANOVA analysis, where the correlation coefficient (R2) is 0.91 and the adjusted R2 is 0.89 at a confidence level of 95%. In addition, the standard
deviation is 7.1% and the lack of fit is not significant. The model
accuracy can be evaluated through the homogenous distribution of externally
studentized residuals and predicted probability values around the
straight line (Figure S1A). In addition, Figure S1B shows the distribution of the real
values obtained from experiments and the predicted values from the
model around the straight line (y = x), which explains a good agreement between the actual and predicted
values.36 Therefore, this model can be
used for optimizing the PAHs reduction using the Mg/ethanol system.
Depending on Figure 4, the optimum conditions for anthracene reduction are 30 mg of Mg,
60 μL of glacial acetic acid, and a reaction time of 30 min.
The result of the gas chromatography flame ionization detector (GC-FID)
analysis of the anthracene before and after the reaction using Mg
catalyzed by glacial acetic acid at the optimum conditions mentioned
above is shown in Appendix (Figure S2). Clearly, the anthracene reduction
using Mg catalyzed by glacial acetic acid gives the 9,10-dydranthracene
as the main product, which is also reported in the literature.28

2.5 Optimization of Coal Tar Reduction
The coal tar used
in this study consists mainly of light PAHs such
as naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene (Figure 5 and Table 3). The concentration of these PAHs extracted
from the coal tar using anhydrous ethanol was determined using standard
calibration curves and their concentrations are listed in Table 3.

The use of the optimum conditions
from anthracene reduction experiments
was found to be insufficient for obtaining high removal of some of
PAHs in the coal tar because it includes multiple PAHs. Use of 30
mg of Mg and 60 μL of glacial acetic acid gave 56% removal of
anthracene and 89% removal of fluoranthene. The sum of the concentrations
of anthracene and fluoranthene in coal tar is close to 500 ppm. Therefore,
the double dosage of reagents (Mg powder + glacial acetic acid) was
added to anhydrous ethanol extract of coal tar to increase the PAH
removal. Thus, increasing the dosage to 60 mg of Mg powder and to
120 μL of glacial acetic acid increases the anthracene removal
to 89% and fluoranthene to 90%. Triple dosage (90 mg of Mg powder
+ 180 μL glacial acetic acid) did not show any improvement of
PAH degradation (Figures 6 and 7; Table 4).

The reduction of PAHs using activated
Mg and anhydrous ethanol
is selective because only anthracene (9) and fluoranthene (14) in
the coal tar were reduced with high removal %. The main products from
anthracene and fluoranthene are 9,10-dihydroanthracene and 2,3-dihydrofluoranthene,
respectively. The light PAHs, such as naphthalene, 2-methylnapthalene,
1-methylnapthalne, phenanthrene, and pyrene, were not reduced by the
anhydrous ethanol with Mg catalyzed by glacial acetic acid under the
conditions used. The current reaction conditions can be described
as being mild conditions; therefore, reduction of the light PAHs (naphthalene,
2-methylnapthalene, and 1-methylnapthalene) requires harsher conditions,
or coordination of these PAHs with iron cyclopentadienyl cation to
be reduced.37

3 Conclusions
Activated Mg with anhydrous ethanol is an effective system to convert
some of the PAHs (e.g., anthracene and fluoranthene) to hydrogenated
PAHs with high removal (∼90%) during a relatively short time
(30 min). The experimental design approach is a useful methodology
that can be used to optimize the PAH reduction using activated Mg
and anhydrous ethanol. The PAH reduction is mainly affected by three
factors: Mg powder dosage, glacial acetic acid volume, and reaction
time. The order of these factors from the highest to the lowest significant
effect is as follows: Mg powder dosage > glacial acetic acid volume
> time. The products of the PAH reduction are less toxic compared
to their parent compounds. Therefore, Mg activated by glacial acetic
acid with anhydrous ethanol can be considered as a promising route
for environmental remediation for the removal of PAHs from PAH-contaminated
coal tar.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Chemicals
Anthracene (>90%) was purchased
from Alfa Aesar and used as received. Nitrobenzene (99%) as an internal
standard was purchased from Fisher Scientific (New Jersey), toluene
(99.5%) was purchased from Caledon Laboratories Ltd. (Georgetown,
ON, Canada), acetonitrile (high-performance liquid chromatography
grade, 99.9%) was purchased from ACP Chemicals (Montreal, Canada),
and anhydrous ethanol was purchased from Commercial Alcohols (Brampton,
ON, Canada). All of these chemicals were used without further purification
except acetonitrile, which was dried over molecular sieves for 2 weeks.
Glacial acetic acid (>99.85%), magnesium powder (≤150 μm,
98% purity), magnesium turnings (∼4000 μm, 98% purity),
and graphite (99.99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Canada. Coal
tar samples were collected from Sydney Tar Ponds, Nova Scotia, Canada,
according to the coal tar sampling methodology.38

4.2 Anthracene and Coal Tar
Reduction Experiments
Initially, anthracene was used as a
representative model compound
of PAHs and subjected to reductive degradation with Mg powder in anhydrous
ethanol. Then, the optimum conditions were used for PAHs reduction
in coal tar. The method used in this study is based on a procedure
used in a previous study.27 Briefly, a
2.0 mL solution of anthracene (250 ppm) in anhydrous ethanol, in a
20 mL poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) vial was added with a desirable
amount (0.010–0.030 g) of Mg powder, which was previously well
grounded using agate mortar and pestle. The reaction started by adding
a desirable volume of glacial acetic acid (10–60 μL),
which was used as an activator, and the reaction mixture was rapidly
stirred for various time intervals (0.5–3.0 h) at room temperature
(21.5 °C). The reaction was quenched by adding 2.0 mL of toluene,
then the mixture was sonicated for 15 min, and filtered using nylon
microfilter paper. For product separation, 4.0 mL of deionized water
was added, and then the mixture was centrifuged (3000 rpm) for 20
min. The toluene extracts were stored at 4 °C in 5 mL sealed
glass vials with PTFE-lined caps. The toluene extracts as well as
reductive degradation on the PAHs were confirmed using gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) and gas chromatography flame ionization
detector (GC-FID). For coal tar degradation, 0.200 g of coal tar was
dissolved in 60.0 mL of anhydrous ethanol, sonicated, then filtered
using nylon 0.45 μm PTFE CHROMIC. Approximately 40% of the coal
tar dissolved. A solution of 2.0 mL of coal tar in anhydrous ethanol
was added to 0.030 g of Mg and 60 μL of glacial acetic acid.
The reaction mixture in a sealed vial was stirred rapidly for 30 min.
Then, the reaction was stopped and the product was separated using
the same steps used for anthracene reduction.

4.3 Experimental
Design
The experimental
design for the anthracene reduction was achieved using the Design-Expert
9.0.0 software. This experimental design was carried out through two
stages: screening of variables and optimization using central composite
design. In the stage of variables screening, a half factorial design
(23) for four factors (magnesium dosage, glacial acetic
acid dosage, graphite dosage, and time) was investigated to determine
the importance of these factors. The factor that has a less significant
effect can be ignored to reduce the number of experiments. The stage
of screening variables includes eight runs listed in Table 1. In the screening of variables,
each factor has two levels: low and high, which were coded by −1
for low and +1 for high levels. The minimum and maximum values of
each factor were chosen according to the preliminary experiments and
literature.39 The second stage is optimization
using the response surface methodology (RSM) based on the central
composite design (CCD). RSM is a mathematical and statistical technique
used for modeling and analysis of experimental data via study of the
relation between the response (e.g., removal (%)) and the variables
(factors) to obtain the optimum response.40 In addition, CCD is a kind of RSM including central points with
factorial or fractional factorial design and it is widely used for
the second-order model.41 For optimizing
the anthracene reduction, three significant factors (i.e., Mg concentration
(10–30 mg), glacial acetic acid volume (10–60 μL),
and exposure time (0.5–3.0 h)) were investigated. Each factor
has three levels: low (−1), medium (0), and high (+1). The
experiments were 17 runs and conducted in triplicates (Table 2).

4.4 Samples
Analysis
To confirm degradation
of the PAHs, the samples were analyzed on GC–MS (Agilent 7683
series II, Wilmington) and GC-FID (Trace Ultra Thermo Scientific).
The GC–MS is equipped with an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector,
which was used at the operation conditions of 70 eV electron ionization
energy, 40–550 m/z scan range,
and 250 °C mass interface temperature. The GC column is a DB-5
capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 m film thickness)
with a helium flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The temperature of GC oven
was programmed at the initial temperature of 80 °C for 1 min
then was increased to 300 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min
and held for 2 min at the final temperature. The injection volume
and the injector temperature were 2 μL and 300 °C, respectively.
The analysis was achieved in splitless mode. For quantitative analysis,
calibration curves of PAHs were achieved in triplicates with good
linearity (R2 > 0.97). The compounds
were
identified by GC–MS through matching the spectrum obtained
with the reference spectra in the NIST library. GC-FID equipped with
the same column type of GC–MS is mentioned above. The detector
and the injector temperature were 300 °C. The GC-FID oven temperature
was programmed to be the same as that of GC–MS. The hydrogen
and air flow rates were 40 and 300 mL/min, respectively.
