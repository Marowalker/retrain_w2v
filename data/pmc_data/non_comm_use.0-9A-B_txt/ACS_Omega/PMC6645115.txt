Cryptand-containing alternative copolymers
were first made from copolymerization of styrenic derivatives and
maleic anhydride and then chemically modified in this work by grafting
methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG) onto the maleic functional groups.
These graft copolymers show interesting multistep soluble–insoluble–soluble
(S–I–S) transitions in acidic aqueous media at a cloud
point (Tcp) and a subsequent mixing temperature
(Tmix). Turbidity measurements and dynamic
light scattering studies indicate that such complex transitions may
be attributed to the entropic contribution associated with the dehydration
and aggregation of the MPEG groups and then the enthalpic contribution
associated with the hydrogen bonding between ethylene glycol and carboxylic
acid groups. More importantly, the phase transition temperatures and
insoluble temperature ranges are very sensitive to changes in subtle
hydrophobic–hydrophilic balance of the copolymers, such as
the variation of pH, the cryptand size, and the length of the MPEG
graft. The understanding of the S–I–S transition in
relation to the structure of the copolymers and the external conditions
may be useful in the design of smart materials and sensors.

Introduction
Stimuli-responsive polymers1−5 have
attracted much interest because of their potential applications in
drug delivery and gene carriers,6,7 tissue engineering,8,9 sensors,10,11 catalysis,12,13 and chromatographic
separation.14,15 Among all of the external stimuli,
temperature is the most convenient and effective stimulus in practical
applications.16−22 Efforts have been devoted
to omnipresent soluble to insoluble (S–I) transition in the
heating process. Raising the temperature breaks the hydrogen bonding
between the hydrophilic groups of the polymer and water, causing a
phase separation at a cloud point (Tcp) associated with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) because
of unfavorable entropy changes.23,24 In comparison, thermoresponsive
polymers with an insoluble to soluble (I–S) transition during
heating is less common and not as well known. At a mixing temperature
(Tmix), which is associated with the upper
critical solution temperature (UCST), the otherwise insoluble polymer
dissolves because of the specific enthalpy-driven interactions such
as electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonding.25−28 Such polymers
may be desirable in a variety of applications.29,30

This distinctly ambivalent S–I–S transition at certain
temperatures is a fascinating property useful in the field of molecular
devices.18−30 Polymers possessing both LCST and UCST in aqueous media are fascinating
materials with potential applications, but there are limited examples
of them in the literature. Recently, progress has been made in the
design and preparation of such polymers manifesting S–I–S
transitions.31−45 Although a number of polymers have been found to show the S–I–S
transitions, the polymers used are mostly limited to block copolymers
in structure, where each block is responsible for one of the transitions.46−50 For example, after the introduction of a
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block, an acrylamide–acrylonitrile
copolymer showed an S–I–S transition in water.50 Some random polymers also demonstrated S–I–S
transitions, maybe because of the subtle hydrophilic–hydrophobic
balance and specific interactions. In the case of an N-vinylacetamide-acrylamide random copolymer, poly(NVA-co-AA), the dehydration of the NVA units and their consequent hydrogen
bonding with the AA carboxyl groups were evidenced by Fourier transform
infrared measurements.51 However, to the
best of our knowledge, graft copolymers showing such a property have
not been reported yet.

We have designed and synthesized well-defined
linear cryptand-containing copolymers,52 and the understanding of their properties in aqueous media would
be important for their use as potential smart materials. By introducing
hydrophilic methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG) segments onto the
maleic anhydride units, a variety of amphiphilic cryptand-containing
graft copolymers can be obtained (as shown in Scheme 1). This represents the first examples of
such graft copolymers demonstrating a compelling S–I–S
transition in acidic aqueous media. In this work, we are able to tune
the transition temperatures (both Tcp and Tmix) and the insolubility range (ΔT) by varying the graft MPEG length, pH, and the cryptand
size. A mechanism involving multiple stepwise aggregation is also
proposed.

Results and Discussion
Polymer Characterization
The structural
variation of the copolymers is illustrated in Scheme 1. The chemical composition, molar masses,
and other characteristics of the copolymers have been studied, and
the results52 are listed in Table 1. We have made two series of
polymers with a shorter and a longer MPEG graft with 350 and 750 Da,
respectively. Each series has several grafting ratios, leaving different
numbers of free carboxylic acid groups.

MPEG-Dependent Thermoresponsive Behavior
At pH 3.0, the
carboxylic acid groups are protonated in water and the aqueous solution
of PDStPEG0MA10-g-MPEG350 at
0.5 mg/mL showed an S–I–S transition (Figure 1A). The polymer is soluble
at lower temperatures, and an S–I transition occurred from
10 to 20 °C during heating, showing a cloud point, because of
the disruption of hydrogen bonds between the polymer and water and
the hydrophobic aggregation and also the hydrogen bonding of the polymer
itself.53−55 If we continue
to heat the sample, the graft copolymer becomes soluble again at a
higher temperature, showing an I–S transition between 30 and
35 °C. This is rather unexpected and is the first example of
an alternating graft copolymer showing such a UCST-related property.
The I–S transition may be attributed to the disruption of inter/intramolecular
hydrogen bonds between ethyl glycol (EG) units and the carboxylic
acid groups of the polymer agrregates.53−55 When a longer and more hydrophilic MPEG (750 Da)
was grafted on the polymer, this S–I–S transition disappeared,
leaving only an S–I transition in acidic aqueous media. The
longer and more hydrophilic MPEG grafts enhance the solvation of the
polymer by water, and the polymer is water soluble at pH 1.0 and shows
a Tcp at ca. 20.2 °C (Figure 1B). This higher Tcp is also caused by the longer and more hydrophilic MPEG-750
side grafts. They further stabilize the milky emulsion above the Tcp (Figures 1B and S2) so that no further
I–S transition is observed at higher temperatures. Maleic acid
is known to have pKa values in the range
of 1.8–6.1 (pK1 = 1.83; pK2 = 6.07).56,57 The carboxylic
acid groups of the polymers are largely deprotonated at pH > 4,
which renders the polymers water soluble for the entire temperature
range (Figures 1B, S2 and Table S1).

The Tcps are higher and less pronounced
at higher pH, when the COOH groups become more deprotonated.

pH-Dependent Thermoresponsiveness
The degree of protonation
of the carboxylic acid groups on the copolymer chains strongly affects
their thermoresponsiveness, making it pH dependent. This is clearly
shown in Figure 2A
for the aqueous solutions of PDStPEG0MA10-g-MPEG350. This polymer has a Tcp of 14.2 °C at pH 3.0. At higher pH values, the partial deprotonation
of the carboxylic acid groups raised the Tcp to 15.7 °C at pH 3.5 and further to 18.2 °C at pH 4.8.
After further deprotonation at pH 5.0 and beyond, no phase transition
temperature was observed. As for the I–S transition, raising
the pH causes the gradual deprotonation of the carboxylic acid groups,
which disrupts the inter/intramolecular hydrogen bonding and causes
the electrostatic repulsion between the charged carboxylate groups,
leading to a lower Tmix. Figure 2B shows the phase transition
temperatures as a function of pH, demonstrating the importance of
pH in the Tcp and Tmix of such a polymer. The insoluble temperature range (ΔT = Tmix – Tcp) shrinks when the pH is raised. All results are summarized
in Table 2. At lower
pH values (pH < 4), the MPEG segments may form hydrogen bonds with
the carboxylic acid groups within the polymer and the excess MPEG
segments may be hydrogen-bonded also with water.54 These two functions affect the phase transition in opposite
directions, depending on hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance. Therefore,
the subtle S–I–S transitions of the polymers are highly
sensitive to the hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance of the polymer.

a ΔT is defined as the difference
between Tmix and Tcp during heating.

The thermodynamic concept based on the interactions in the aqueous
system26,27,58 may be used
to explain and estimate the shift of Tmix of such a polymer. The mixing and phase separation processes are
in equilibrium at Tmix, and thus the mixing
Gibbs energy ΔGm = 0. Tmix can then be expressed as  To explain the trend of Tmix, all possible contributions to ΔHm and ΔSm in the mixing should be
considered. With rising pH value, the entropic change ΔSm is similar in the mixing process for the protonated
and deprotonated states, while the enthalpic change of deprotonated
species is smaller than that of the protonated one (intra/intermolecular
hydrogen bonds between EG and carboxylic acid groups), which should
favor a lower Tmix.27,28,58−60

Cryptand-Size-Dependent
S–I–S Transition
The MPEG-350-grafted copolymers
illustrated in Scheme 1 all showed S–I–S transitions during heating (Figure 3). Upon cooling,
the solutions first became cloudy (S–I transition) and then
slowly transparent (I–S transition). The polymer solutions
all show a very similar behavior (Figure 3). Previously, amphiphilic PEG-grafted copolymers
based on poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) with
or without crown ether units53,54 showed only an S–I
transition. Therefore, the presence of the cryptand unit may be important
for the S–I–S transition behavior. Both Tcp and Tmix demonstrated an
upward trend with increasing cryptand size (Scheme 1, Figure 3, and Table 2). We also noticed that the increasing cryptand size leads
to an expansion of the insoluble temperature range (ΔT in Table 2).

diameters (Dh) measured by DLS at pH 3.0.

(B) PDStPEG2MA10-g-MPEG350,
and (C) PDStPEG3MA10-g-MPEG350.

As expected, the Tcp increases
with increasing number of EG units on the cryptand cavities (m from
0 to 3 in Scheme 1)
because of increased hydrophilicity. The larger size of the cryptand
makes the segments more flexible, resulting in more extensive hydrogen
bonding between EG and carboxylic acid units and thus a much larger
enthalpy to break the polymer–polymer hydrogen bonds. In comparison,
the hydrophobic interaction is entropic and less dominant. Therefore,
on the basis of the magnitudes of enthalpy and entropy,26,27,56Tmix demonstrates an increasing trend.

The effect of salt on the
unique S–I–S transition of the copolymers was also investigated
(Figure S4A). It is known that the addition
of NaCl could lower the Tcp of thermoresponsive
polymers because of the salting-out effect.61 Recent studies have shown that the complexation of the crown ether-like
cavity with alkaline ions may lead to salting-in effect, raising the Tcp of crown ether-containing polymer.62,63 In this work, the graft copolymer PDStPEG1MA10-g-MPEG350 showed only a relatively small decrease
of ca. 8.3 °C for its Tcp when the
NaCl concentration was raised from 0 to 1 M (Figure S4B). Such salt tolerance of these polymers for the S–I–S
transitions may be the result of combined salting-in and salting-out
effects.

Multiple Stepwise Aggregation
To understand the S–I–S transitions discussed above,
static and dynamic light scattering techniques were used to study
the multiple stepwise aggregation process. At lower temperatures,
PDStPEG1MA10-g-MPEG350 in water
is a clear solution but shows a hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) of ∼86 nm with a weight-average mass Mw,agg of 6.4 × 105. This indicates
that this polymer exists as micelles with an aggregation number Nagg of 34. Figure 3A shows that the Dh increases dramatically from 70 to 370 nm when the temperature was
raised from 34.2 to 45.0 °C (along with a dramatic increase of
the mass of the aggregates from 6.4 × 105 to ca. 1.7
× 108 for Mw,agg (Table 3)), corresponding
to the minimum of the light transmittance, suggesting that the polymer
changes from simple micelles to larger micellar aggregates, also as
confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 4A,B). During this
process, the MPEG segments dehydrated because of the disruption of
hydrogen bonds between the EG units and water.53−55 The shorter MPEG-350 segments may not be
sufficiently hydrophilic to stabilize the isolated micelles, especially
the micelles with high curvatures.26,50−56,64 Spontaneously,
some of the EG units may form intra/intermolecular hydrogen bonds
with the carboxylic acid groups, resulting in the formation of micellar
clusters with a loose structure. To confirm the effect of hydrogen
bonding, we further protected some of the carboxylic groups by allyl
groups (Figure S5). The I–S transition
disappeared (Figure S6), indicating the
importance of the carboxylic acid groups in the formation of micellar
clusters. Upon further heating, the aggregates become more dehydrated
with further disruption of hydrogen bonds with water, compacting the
larger and looser aggregates into smaller and denser ones with a Dh of 75 nm and a Mw,agg of ca. 1.6 × 106 (Figure 4C and Table 3). At this point, the solution becomes clear at Tmix. The aggregates are smaller but less uniform
in size, as shown by the TEM image (Figure 4C), still showing a clear solution. This
multistep aggregation process is illustrated in Scheme 2. During the process, the aqueous solutions
of the polymer changed from a clear and transparent solution at 25
°C (Dh ∼ 70 nm) to a milky
white suspension at 50 °C (Dh ∼
370 nm) and then to a bluish transparent solution at 80 °C (Dh ∼ 75 nm). In contrast, the longer MPEG-750
segments make the graft copolymer more hydrophilic and more soluble
in water, raising the Tcp of the MPEG-750
copolymers; they further stabilize the micellar aggregates after the
S–I transition (Figures 1B and S2) so that there is no I–S
transition observed.

Conclusions
Well-defined amphiphilic cryptand-containing copolymers were synthesized
from alternating copolymerization of styrene and maleic anhydride
and then modified by grafting different numbers of MPEG side chains
onto some of the maleic functional groups. The copolymers showed an
S–I–S transition in acidic aqueous media. The S–I
transition results from mainly the entropic contribution associated
with the dehydration and the aggregation of the MPEG segments, and
the I–S transition is attributed to the principally enthalpic
contribution caused by the disruption of intra/intermolecular hydrogen
bonds. The protonation state of the carboxylic acid groups and the
hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance also play decisive roles in
the S–I–S transition. The phase transition temperatures
(both Tcp and Tmix) and the insoluble temperatures ranges (ΔT) may be tuned by the pH, the cryptand size, and the length of the
MPEG grafts. A multiple stepwise aggregation process driven by temperature
is proposed, involving a successive three-step “micelles to
micellar clusters to aggregates” changes during the S–I–S
transition. The making and modification of these graft copolymers
and the understanding of such a multistep aggregation process should
help in the design of new responsive polymers for potential chemical
and biochemical applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Methoxy poly(ethylene
glycol)s (MPEGs, 350 and 750 Da) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) from Aldrich were used as received without
further purification. Deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6, 99.9%) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories.
Other reagents were used as received.

Instruments
1H NMR spectra were recorded on a
400 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer at room temperature with tetramethylsilane
as the internal standard. The turbidity measurements of the polymer
solutions were conducted on a Cary-300 UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Varian) at a wavelength of 500 nm, equipped with a Cary temperature
controller at a rate of 0.5 °C/min. The polymer concentration
was set at 0.5 mg/mL. The onset and the offset in transmittance curves
are hard to define, so the Tcp or Tmix representing the phase transition temperatures
are calculated as the equation d2T1 / dT22 = 0 from transmittance
(T1) and temperature (T2) during heating. The hydrodynamic diameters (Dh) of the samples were determined on a Nano
ZS Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments, U.K.) equipped with a He/Ne laser
light source (633 nm, 4.0 mW) at a scattering angle of 90° (back
scattering detection). Before the data were collected, the samples
were allowed to equilibrate for 2 min at each temperature. The stock
solutions were filtered through a Millipore 0.80 μm poly(vinylidene
difluoride) filter into a dust-free vial. The tested polymer concentration
was 0.5 mg/mL. Static light scattering (SLS) experiments were conducted
on a CGS-3 compact goniometer (ALV GmbH) equipped with an ALV-5000
multi-tau digital real-time correlator at selected temperatures using
a Science/Electronics temperature controller. The laser wavelength
was 632 nm. The angular range was between 30 and 150° with an
increment of 10°. The polymer solutions (0.5 mg/mL) were filtered
through a 0.2 μm filter (Millipore) directly into precleaned
10 mm tubes. The standard (toluene) and solvent (water) were used
to calculate molar mass. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
were taken using a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope
operating at 200 kV. Samples (0.5 mg/mL) were prepared by drop-casting
micelle solutions onto carbon-coated copper grids and then air-drying
at room temperature before measurement.

MPEGylation
The copolymers PDStPEGmMA10 (m = 0, 1, 2, and 3) were synthesized
by RAFT cyclopolymerization, as previously reported.51 MPEGs were grafted onto the backbone of PDStPEGmMA10 by the esterification reaction.
In a typical reaction, PDStPEG0MA10 (250 mg)
was first dissolved in 3 mL of DMF, and MPEG (350 Da, 3 equiv to maleic
anhydride units) was added into the solution. The mixture was immersed
in an oil bath at 110 °C for 48 h. After cooling down, the crude
product was precipitated in cold ethyl ether, filtered, and dissolved
in a dilute acid solution, followed by dialysis for a week. Next,
the aqueous solution of the polymer was freeze-dried, and the resulting
graft copolymer was noted as PDStPEG0MA10-g-MPEG350.

Allylation of
Carboxylic Acid Groups
PDStPEG0MA10-g-MPEG350 (50 mg) was first dissolved in 2 mL of
DMF, and excess K2CO3 (2 equiv to carboxyl groups)
was added into the solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 2 h. Then, excess allyl iodide (2 equiv to carboxyl groups) was
added and the mixture was stirred overnight. Afterward, the crude
product was precipitated in cold ethyl ether, filtered, and dissolved
in DMF/aqueous solution, followed by dialysis for a week (MWCO, 3500).
Next, the aqueous solution of the polymer was freeze-dried, and the
resulting graft copolymer was noted as PDStPEG0MA10-g-MPEG350-allyl.
