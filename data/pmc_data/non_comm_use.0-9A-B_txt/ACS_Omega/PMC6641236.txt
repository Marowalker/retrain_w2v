The restricted active space self-consistent
field method in the
26-electron/27-orbital active space and the 6-311(d) basis set has
been used to investigate the mechanisms of the photochemical isomerization
reactions concerning the model systems of 1,2,3-thiadiazole and 1,2,3-selenadiazole.
The computational works suggest that the preferred reaction paths
for both 1,2,3-thiadiazole and 1,2,3-selenadiazole are as follows:
reactant → Franck–Condon region → conical intersection
→ intermediate → transition states → photoproducts.
As a result, the structures of the conical intersections, which play
a decisive role in these photoisomerization reactions, are obtained.
In particular, the present theoretical evidences demonstrate that
the potential energy surfaces for the formation of 1,3-diradicals
are quite flat. This may explain why their experimental detections
are so difficult.

1 Introduction
1,2,3-Thiadiazoles
and their derivatives have attracted intense
interest because of their use in the study of fundamental chemistry
problems and potential applications.1 It
is well-accepted that various 1,2,3-thiadiazoles can exhibit biological
activity such as antibacterial,2 antiviral,3,4 antitumor,5 antiallergic,6 systemic acquired resistance,7,8 fungicidal,9−12 and insecticidal13 activity, as well
as being DNA photocleavers14 and reagents
in photolitography.15−21 Also, 1,2,3-thiadiazoles have been introduced into other active
compounds as an active moiety for lead discovery.22

The photochemistry of 1,2,3-thiadiazole (1) has been
the subject of many investigations over the past 50 years.23−42 The experimental observations by Krantz, Laureni, and many chemists
indicate that direct irradiation of 1 can produce thiirene
(2), thioketene (3), and ethynethiol (4).23−42 See Scheme 1. These
experimental results strongly imply that the product distribution
detected so far from direct photolysis is basically a characteristic
of reactivity associated with the 1,3-diradical (5).23−42 Its experimental detection, however, was anticipated could be very
difficult because the early studies revealed that the energy of the
intermediate (5) was computed to be much higher than
those of the final photoproduct species (2, 3, and 4).43,44 Moreover, these photoproducts
were proposed to be yielded directly in the thiadiazole-excited state,
in concert with nitrogen extrusion.45

Scheme 1 It is well-known that selenium compounds show broad similarities
with the corresponding sulfur analogues, that is, they offer utilizations
in the syntheses of dyes, pharmaceuticals, and various fine chemicals.46 Because the selenium element has a larger atomic
size in comparison with oxygen and sulfur, molecules including the
selenium atom always give an increased polarizability, which, in turn,
make them generally less stable than the sulfur analogues. In addition,
its physical properties make selenium-containing heterocycles desirable
materials in the growth of organooptic and organoelectronic materials.47−51 As a result, because 1,2,3-selenadiazoles undergo a wide variety
of reactions as 1,3-dipoles and develop the synthesis of different
organoselenium compounds, 1,2,3-selenadiazoles have also attracted
much attention in several laboratories.52,53 In fact, because
of the reason that 1,2,3-selenadiazoles are easily separated with
the loss of a nitrogen molecule and a selenium atom under both light
irradiation and thermal conditions, 1,2,3-selenadiazoles have drawn
attention as versatile intermediates for the preparation of alkynes.54−67

In contrast to the photochemistry of 1,2,3-thiadiazole (1) mentioned above, however, the photochemistry of 1,2,3-selenadiazole
(6) has been little explored.24,25,68,69 For instance,
until now, Krantz and co-workers reported that after irradiating samples
of matrix-isolated 1,2,3-selenadiazole at 8 K, the reactions were
monitored by IR spectroscopy.24−32 On the basis of comparisons with sulfur analogues, new absorption
bands for selenirene (7), selenoketene (8), ethynylselenol (9), and acetylene (10) were obtained (Scheme 2). It has to be noted here that the photoproduct 10 is not observed in the photolysis of 1. Presumably,
once a 1,3-diradical (11) is formed, it can easily rearrange
to selenoketene (8).24−32 Therefore, no acetylene (10) can be found in the photochemical
isomerization reactions of 6. Nevertheless, an intermediate
with a five-membered ring was proposed to lead to a reaction between
selenoketene (8) and the diradical (11).56,68,69

Scheme 2 The above experimental
results and discussion inspire this study.
The computation of the structures of the key points and the mechanisms
for the photochemical isomerization reactions of 1 and 6 are thus of great academic interest. To the best of our
knowledge, so far, there has been neither experimental nor theoretical
study for the photochemical mechanisms of both 1 and 6. It is astonishing how little is known about the mechanisms
of the photochemical reactions of 1 and 6 because these molecules are so important in bioorganic and organic
chemistry.1−69 Accordingly, using a more sophisticated quantum chemical theory,
the study of the potential energy surfaces of 1,2,3-thiadiazole (1) and 1,2,3-thiadiazole (6) systems is undertaken.
The goal of this study is to combine both observed experimental works
and theoretical examinations to provide a comprehensive understanding
of the excited-state behaviors of 1,2,3-thiadiazoles and 1,2,3-selenadiazoles.
From this, one may obtain the design of some useful related systems
and allow some practical applications.

However, one reviewer
indicated that the selenium derivative likely
seems to populate a triplet state because of the heavy-atom effect.
This assumption is based on a recent paper.70 Nevertheless, according to the available experimental reports,24−32,68,69 no species on the triplet state have been observed so far. Therefore,
the photochemical reactions studied in this work are all focused on
the singlet surfaces.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 1,2,3-Thiadiazole
To obtain the comprehension
of the photoisomerization mechanisms of 1,2,3-thiadiazole (1), its reaction profiles at the restricted active space self-consistent
field (RASSCF)(26,27)/6-311G(d) are summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1 also contains the relative energies of the
critical points with respect to the ground-state minimum 1. A general outline of the five p−π orbitals in unsubstituted
1,2,3-thiadiazole, which forms the basis for this study, is shown
in Figure A (Supporting Information). Some
important geometrical parameters for the key points are collected
in Figure 2.

(1). The abbreviations FC and CI stand for Frank–Condon
and conical intersection, respectively. The relative energies were
obtained at the RASSCF(26,27)/6-311G(d) level of theory. For RASSCF-optimized
structures of the critical points see Figure 2. For more information see the text.

Their relative energies are given in Figure 1. The corresponding RASSCF vectors are shown
in the inset. The heavy arrows indicate the main atomic motions in
the transition-state eigenvector. For more information see the Supporting Information.

In the first step, 1 is promoted to its excited
singlet
state by a vertical excitation, FC-1, as outlined on
the left-hand side of Figure 1. After this vertical excitation process, 1 is
situated on the singlet surface but still has the ground-state (S0) geometry. The RASSCF(26,27)/6-311G(d) result indicates that
this vertical excitation energy (S0 → S1(S0 geom)) is 113 kcal/mol. The experimental excitation
energy of 1 is reported to be 133–95.2 kcal/mol
(=215–300 nm),25,39 which is in agreement with this
computational value. Because of this agreement, it is therefore expected
that the same computational accuracy should be suitable to discuss
the mechanisms of photochemical isomerization reactions of 1 (vide infra).

From the FC-1 point, 1 relaxes to reach
an S1/S0 CI, from which the photoexcited 1 can
easily decay to S0 in a nonradiative way. The RASSCF computations
given in Figure 1 suggest
that the energy of CI-1 lies 63 kcal/mol above 1 and 50 kcal/mol lower in energy than FC-1.
Funneling through the CI-1 point, different reaction
pathways on the S0 surface can be anticipated by following
either the gradient difference vector or the derivative coupling vector
directions.71−75 As seen in Figure 2, the large contribution of the gradient difference vector is regarded
as S–N1 bond-breaking motion, whereas the derivative
coupling vector is in accord with stretching motions about both S–C2 and N1–N2 bonds, which results
in a vibrationally hot 1-S0 molecule. Accordingly,
following the gradient difference vector from CI-1 (Figure 2) leads to the production
of 1,3-diradical (5). As far as the author is aware,
this is the first theoretical verification that 5 can
be produced through the extrusion of nitrogen from the reactant molecule, 1.

From the 5 + N2 point, both
carbon and
sulfur atoms in the 5 species can automatically combine
together to form thiirene (2) possessing a three-membered
ring. It has to be mentioned here that attempts to find the transition
state between 5 and 2 using the RASSCF(26,27)/6-311G(d)
level of theory are always unsuccessful. It is thus concluded that
this transition state would not exist on the RASSCF(26,27)/6-311G(d)
potential energy surface. Moreover, a [1,2]-hydrogen migration can
occur via the transition state TS-2, which is computed
to be about 10 kcal/mol above 5 and nitrogen, from which
results in the final photoproduct 3 (thioketene). Also, Figure 1 shows that the other
1,2-hydrogen shift process can take place through the transition state TS-3, which has a higher activation barrier (15 kcal/mol)
than the energies of 5 and nitrogen. This pathway yields
the other photoproduct 4 (ethynethiol).

It has
to be emphasized that the activation barriers at TS-2 and TS-3 are computed, respectively, to be about 10
and 15 kcal/mol, which are much less than the energy difference of
67 kcal/mol between CI-1 and Int-1. In other
words, once reactant 1 is photoexcited to jump to the FC-1 point, then this molecule can easily relax to the singlet
ground state through the CI (CI-1). From CI-1 to Int-1, 1 can have an excess energy
of around 67 kcal/mol, which is greater than the energy difference
between 5 and TS-2 (10 kcal/mol) and 5 and TS-3 (15 kcal/mol). Accordingly, 1 can easily cross over the TS-2 and TS-3 barriers to yield the final products, 3 and 4, respectively. However, the available experimental observations
indicate that the existence of the intermediate 1,3-diradical (5) is still uncertain.23−42 According to the computational results represented in Figure 1, the barrier height from Int-1 to TS-1 is quite small (∼9 kcal/mol)
and the activation barriers from 5 to the final photoproducts
(2, 3, and 4) are small as
well (at most 15 kcal/mol). In other words, the theoretical evidence
strongly suggests that the potential energy surface for the formation
of the 1,3-diradical (5) is quite flat. As a result,
once 1,3-diradical (5) is formed, the final photoproducts
(2, 3, and 4) can be easily
obtained. The above theoretical result may explain why the experimental
detection of 5 is so difficult.23−42

Besides these, the RASSCF results schematically shown in Figure 1 reveal that finding
a transition state for producing acetylene from the 1,3-diradical
(5) is unsuccessful. The present theoretical examinations
therefore indicate that on the RASSCF(26,27)/6-311G(d) surface, no
transition states exist for the loss of a sulfur atom in the 1,3-diradical
(5) to yield acetylene. Indeed, until now, no experimental
observations about acetylene under the light irradiations of 1 have been reported yet.23−42

In consequence, the theoretical computations demonstrate that
the
mechanisms for the above pathways proceed as follows:

Path 1: 1(S0) + hν → FC-1 → CI-1(S1/S0) → Int-1 → TS-1 → 5 + N2 → 2 + N2

Path 2: 1(S0) + hν → FC-1 → CI-1(S1/S0) → Int-1 → TS-1 → 5 + N2 → TS-2 → 3 + N2

Path 3: 1(S0) + hν → FC-1 → CI-1(S1/S0) → Int-1 → TS-1 → 5 + N2 → TS-3 → 4 + N2

Furthermore,
as seen in Figure 1, the RASSCF computations demonstrate that the barrier
height increases in the order: TS-1 (5.8 kcal/mol) < TS-2 (10 kcal/mol) < TS-3 (15 kcal/mol), which
strongly implies that paths 1 and 2 are preferred over path 3. On
the basis of these theoretical evidences, it is thus anticipated that
thiirene (2) and thioketene (3) are the
main photoproducts in the singlet photoisomerization of 1,2,3-thiadiazole
(1). The quantum yields of the photoproducts should decrease
in the order: 2 > 3 > 4, which
agrees well with the available experimental observations.23−42

2.2 1,2,3-Selenadiazole
We next consider
the photorearrangements of 1,2,3-selenadiazole (6), as
indicated in Scheme 2. Similar to the case of 1, the entire potential energy
surface based on the RASSCF calculations is collected in Figure 3. The optimized structures
of the key points on the mechanistic pathways of Figure 3 are summarized in Figure 4. Again, the five
p−π orbitals in unsubstituted 1,2,3-selenadiazole, which
is the basis of the present study, are given in Figure B (Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Energy profiles for the
photoisomerization modes of 1,2,3-selenadiazole
(6). The relative energies were obtained at the RASSCF(26,27)/6-311G(d)
level of theory. All energies (in kcal/mol) are given with respect
to the reactant (6). The abbreviations FC and CI stand
for Frank–Condon and conical intersection, respectively. For
RASSCF-optimized structures of the key points see Figure 4. For more information see
the text.

Figure 4 RASSCF(26,27)/6-311G(d) geometries (in Å
and deg) for the
photoisomerization of 1,2,3-selenadiazole (6), transition
state (TS), and isomer products. The corresponding RASSCF
vectors are shown in the inset. The heavy arrows indicate the main
atomic motions in the transition-state eigenvector. For more information
see the Supporting Information.

The RASSCF(26,27)/6-311G(d) method has been used
to compute the
first vertical excitation energy of 1,2,3-selenadiazole (6) at the FC structure, which is from the singlet ground state (S0) to the lowest singlet excited state (S1). As
one can see FC-2 in Figure 3, this vertical excitation energy is computed
to be 104 kcal/mol, which is in good accordance with the experimental
findings (235–280 nm = 122–102 kcal/mol).24−32

Then, from the FC-2 point, 6 can
return
to the ground state via one radiationless path. As shown in Figure 3, the first step
of this route includes a CI S1/S0CI-2 and eventually
leads to the formation of several photoproducts. It is apparent that
the computed structure of S1/S0CI-2 given in Figure 4 is quite similar
to the geometry found for S1/S0CI-1 shown in Figure 2. As seen in Figure 4, the derivative
coupling vector71−75 for CI-2 agrees well with the Se–C2 and C1–N2 stretching motions, which
finally results in vibrationally hot species at the singlet ground
(S0) state. The gradient difference vector,71−75 however, fits in with the intramolecular formation of a ring-opening
species (Int-2). In other words, increasing the Se–N1 distance and following the gradient difference vector from S1/S0CI-2 can lead to the formation of the cis-butadiene-like intermediate (Int-2). From
the Int-2 point, this molecule can generate the singlet
1,3-diradical (11) with concomitant extrusion of nitrogen
via the TS-4, whose activation barrier was computed to
be 15 kcal/mol. Subsequently, four rearrangement pathways can take
place from the 1,3-diradical (11): (i) both selenium
and carbon atoms in the 1,3-diradical (11) can automatically
combine together to produce selenirene (7) product. However,
repeated attempts using the RASSCF(26,27)/6-311G(d) level of theory
to find the transition state between 11 and 7 always failed. It is thus concluded that the transition state would
not exist on the path (i) surface, (ii) one H atom of the CH group
transfers to the other CH group leading to the formation of selenoketene
(8) product via the TS-5, (iii) one H atom
of the CH group undergoes the 1,2-shift to attach to selenium to result
in ethynylselenone (9) product via the TS-6, and (iv) the 1,3-diradical (11) can extrude one selenium
atom to yield acetylene (10) product via the TS-7.

As a consequence, the theoretical examinations reveal that
the
mechanisms for the photochemical isomerization reaction of 6 should be represented as follows:

Path (i): 6(S0) + hν → FC-2 → CI-2(S1/S0) → Int-2 → TS-4 → 11 + N2 → 7 + N2

Path (ii): 6(S0) + hν → FC-2 → CI-2(S1/S0) → Int-2 → TS-4 → 11 + N2 → TS-5 → 8 + N2

Path (iii): 6(S0) + hν → FC-2 → CI-2(S1/S0) → Int-2 → TS-4 → 11 + N2 → TS-6 → 9 + N2

Path (iv): 6(S0) + hν → FC-2 → CI-2(S1/S0) → Int-2 → TS-4 → 11 + N2 → TS-7 → 10 + Se + N2

It
has to be noted that the geometrical structure of 11 shown
in Figure 4 is quite
analogous to the previously studied intermediate 5 given
in Figure 2. Both 1,3-diradicals
(5 and 11)
have an allyl-like structure with one unpaired electron lying on the
carbon and the other odd-electron on the group 16 atom (i.e., S or
Se, respectively). Also, as mentioned earlier, it was claimed that
the existence of the 1,3-diradical (11) is still not
experimentally confirmed.24,25,68,69 Our computational results based
on the RASSCF study suggest that the energy difference among Int-2, TS-4, and 11 is not much
(∼15 kcal/mol), and the activation barriers from 11 to the final photoproducts (8, 9, and 10) are not much as well (at most 23 kcal/mol). These facts
strongly imply that the 1,3-diradical 11 is kinetically
unstable and may rearrange spontaneously to the stable minima if 11 is produced. This could be the reason why the spectroscopic
signals of 11 have still not been experimentally detected
yet.24,25,68,69

Additionally, the computational results represented
in Figure 3 show that
on one
hand, 1,2,3-selenadiazole (6) possesses an energy of
about 73 kcal/mol because of its relaxation from CI-2 to the local minimum Int-2. On the other hand, the
theoretical examinations also demonstrate that the barrier heights
from Int-2 to TS-4 and from 11 to TS-5, TS-6, and TS-7 are
estimated to be 15, 11, 13, and 23 kcal/mol, respectively. Because
of a large excess energy (73 kcal/mol) acquired from the decay of CI-2 to Int-2, the above barriers can readily
be surmounted. As a consequence, 6 can easily cross over
the TS-5, TS-6, and TS-7 to
form the final photoproducts, 8, 9, and 10, respectively. Besides these, on the basis of the computational
results given in Figure 3, it is shown that paths (i) and (ii) are more favorable than paths
(iii) and (iv) from a kinetic viewpoint. Accordingly, these theoretical
findings anticipate that the quantum yields of 7 and 8 should be much larger than those for isomeric photoproducts 9 and 10. This prediction is verified by some
experimental reports.24,25,68,69

3 Conclusions
In this work, the photoisomerization reactions of 1,2,3-thiadiazole
(1) and 1,2,3-selenadiazole (6) have been
theoretically examined by using the RASSCF(26,27) method to obtain
a better understanding of their mechanisms. Their ground-state and
excited-state potential energy surfaces are schematically illustrated
in Figures 1 and 3, respectively.

The present theoretical investigations
demonstrate that upon photoirradiation,
both 1 and 6 are vertically promoted to
the S1 excited state. Subsequently, radiationless decay
from S1 to S0 occurs via a CI, which leads to
a rapid ring-opening process with concomitant extrusion of nitrogen.
Starting from these CIs, various kinds of photoproducts can be reached
on barrier-less ground-state relaxation paths. These theoretical findings,
based on the CI viewpoint, have helped us to better understand their
photochemical behaviors, which can support the available experimental
observations.23−42,56,68,69 Moreover, the theoretical examinations suggest
that both 1,3-radicals (5 and 11) play a
dominant role in the photoisomerization reactions of 1 and 6, respectively, whose existences are first verified
by the theoretical work. However, because the computed potential energy
surfaces around these 1,3-radicals are quite flat, it would be very
difficult to detect them using the experimental equipment.

4 Methodology
RASSCF76,77 calculations
were performed using the multiconfigurational
self-consistent-field program in GAUSSIAN 09.78 It is already reported that RASSCF has some advantages over correlated
methods, such as CASPT2 or multireference configuration interaction.76,77 As a result, the key point structures on the S0 and S1 surfaces were optimized at the RASSCF level of computations
using the standard 6-311G(d) basis set,79 that is, RASSCF(26,27)/6-311G(d). In other words, 26 valence electrons
in 27 valence orbitals are chosen as the active space for both 1,2,3-thiadiazole
(1) and 1,2,3-selenadiazole (6). RAS1 contains
all of the seven doubly-occupied σ orbitals, RAS2 is made up
of three doubly-occupied nonbonding orbitals and five π orbitals
(with six π electrons), and RAS3 is made up of seven σ*
and five π* orbitals. When the maximum force and its root mean
square were less than 0.00045 and 0.00005 hartree/bohr, respectively,
the optimization was determined. Localization of crossing minima,
transition states, and the minima is performed using Cartesian coordinates.
The computational results are thus independent of any specific choice
of internal variables. The Cartesian coordinates and energetics calculated
for the various points are available as Supporting Information.
