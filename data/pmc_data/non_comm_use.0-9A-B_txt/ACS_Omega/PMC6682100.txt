Three-dimensional
selective laser sintering printing was utilized
to produce porous, solid objects, in which the catalytically active
component, Pd/SiO2, is attached to an easily printable
supporting polypropylene framework. Physical properties of the printed
objects, such as porosity, were controlled by varying the printing
parameters. Structural characterization of the objects was performed
by helium ion microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray
tomography, and the catalytic performance of the objects was tested
in the hydrogenation of styrene, cyclohexene, and phenylacetylene.
The results show that the selective laser sintering process provides
an alternative and effective way to produce highly active and easily
reusable heterogeneous catalysts without significantly reducing the
catalytic efficiency of the active Pd/SiO2 component. The
ability to control the size, porosity, mechanical properties, flow
properties, physical properties, and chemical properties of the catalyst
objects opens up possibilities to optimize devices for different reaction
environments including batch reactions and continuous flow systems.

Introduction
During the last decade,
interest in utilizing additive manufacturing
for a wide variety of applications has increased rapidly.1−5 This has also fueled the development of three-dimensional (3D) printing
as one of the most promising technologies in the preparation of multifunctional
and effective catalysts6,7 Recently, techniques such as fused
deposition modeling or direct ink writing have been used to fabricate
active catalysts.8,9 In addition to these extrusion-based
methods, stereolithography has been used to produce catalysts for
multistep reactions.10 Furthermore, 3D
printing has been exploited in the preparation of highly sophisticated
reactors and reactionware that have the catalytically active material
directly embedded in their structures.11,12 However, despite
all of the aforementioned advances, most of the previously used 3D
printing-based techniques require postprocessing of the printed objects
and/or synthesis of multicomponent printing materials with specific
physical properties to obtain the final catalytically active object.
Such steps significantly limit the usability of 3D printing for catalyst
manufacturing in practice.

Selective laser sintering (SLS) is
one of the most commonly used
industrial 3D printing techniques, but it is currently practically
unutilized for the preparation of structured catalysts. In a typical
SLS process, a CO2 laser is used to sinter polymer powder
to the desired physical form by partially or completely melting particles
in order to fuse them together. If the particles are sintered in such
a way that their surfaces are only partially melted, a solid structure
containing accessible voids between the sintered grains is obtained.
Furthermore, by adjusting the printing conditions,13−16 the porosity, as well as other
physical and mechanical properties, of the printed object can be controlled
and even adjusted differently within different sections of the object.17 Such objects can be utilized directly in chemical
applications. For example, if a porous column is printed, a fluid
(liquid or gas) can flow through the object, interacting with the
surface of the partially fused particles.17 By mixing a chemically active component into an easily printable
polymer matrix, a range of chemically functional objects can be prepared.
3D printing opens up possibilities to design and manufacture objects
that not only exhibit desired catalytic properties but also meet specific
physical and mechanical requirements set by the reaction environment.

The advantages that porous SLS 3D-printed objects offer are obvious
when compared with typical powder-based catalysts. Catalyst powders
are commonly used in batch reactors where they must be carefully filtered
off after the catalytic reaction has taken place. Another option is
to pack the powder in a column and use it in a continuous flow reactor.
In the latter case, particular care must be taken when packing the
powder to prevent excessive channeling and formation of ineffective
regions in the reactor. However, it is always possible that some channeling
occurs when the reaction solution runs through the column. In contrast,
if the particles are sintered together by 3D printing, channeling
becomes impossible and the catalyst can be easily recovered from the
reaction vessel and reused.

Recently, we have shown that SLS
3D printing can be used to fabricate
solid but porous flow-through filters for selective capturing of Au,
Pd, and Pt from acidic leachate of electronic waste.17,18 In this paper, we utilized the SLS technique to produce printed
heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst for lab-scale batch reactions.
The printing material used in the work is a mixture of commercially
available Pd/SiO2 powder and polypropylene (PP). The impact
of the porous structure of the printed objects on the catalytic activity
was studied using advanced imaging technology, while the hydrogenation
activity of the 3D-printed catalyst is demonstrated by performing
a series of catalytic reactions in a batch reactor.

Results and Discussion
Palladium on silica (Pd/SiO2 with 5 wt % palladium)
was selected as the active component of the hybrid printing material
because of its well-known catalytic activity, high surface area, and
good thermal durability.19,20 On the other hand,
the highly inert PP was used as the supporting polymer matrix as it
is a fully saturated hydrocarbon, which allows also reductive chemical
reactions, such as hydrogenation, to be performed without the risk
of decomposition of the polymer framework itself. Loading of 10 wt
% of the Pd/SiO2 component was mixed into the supporting
PP powder, resulting in a powder mixture for SLS printing that contained
0.5 wt % of palladium. The concentration of palladium in the SLS 3D-printed
stir bar sleeves was confirmed by using microwave-assisted leaching,
followed by ICP–OES analysis (Table S1).

Catalytic reactions were carried out in an autoclave as
batch reactions.
The catalysts were introduced to the system as 3D-printed magnetic
stir bar covers (Figure 1). This provides a simple and practical way to use catalysts in lab-scale
reactors. We underline that when using SLS 3D printing, the catalytic
object can be of any shape or size, and therefore can be tailor-made
for different types of batch reactors or shaped as a flow-through
object for continuous flow reactors. By carefully fine-tuning the
3D printing parameters, such as laser power, printing rate, and the
printing temperature, a porous object with good mechanical properties,
such as durability, hardness, and rigidity, can be fabricated. After
experimenting with various settings, an optimal combination of parameters
was found (Experimental Details) and used
for all printed catalysts. When considering stir bar covers, the catalytic
object must be rigid enough to stay firmly around the stir bar during
the reactions. Hardness and durability are also crucial as the printed
covers need to resist abrasive forces that take place not only during
stirring but also during cleaning. In our system, no detectable wearing
or breakage of the catalytic objects was observed, thus, showing their
ability to withstand mechanical stress caused by the stirring.

stir bar sleeves (diameter of 6.5 mm and length
of 8.5 mm) used in hydrogenation experiments. Right: A concept of
an alternative catalysts design for the mechanical stirrer.21

The nonconducting nature of the used PdSiO2/PP
material
prevented the use of traditional imaging by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). However, this problem was solved by using helium ion microscopy
(HIM), where the charging effect of helium cations is neutralized
by a low-voltage electron beam. With this technique, even highly sensitive
and insulating materials like biological samples can be accurately
imaged without any loss of image quality.22 First, a HIM image of a pure SLS 3D-printed PP was taken to confirm
the resulting porous structure generated by the voids between the
partially melted polymer beads (Figure 2a). Similar porosity is also evident in the HIM images
of the top and break surfaces of the 3D-printed stir bar covers containing
10 wt % of Pd/SiO2 (Figure 2b–d). In the latter case, the additive Pd/SiO2 is clearly visible as pale colored areas with sharp edges.
Furthermore, the top and break surface images show that the additive
is evenly distributed and firmly attached only on the surface of the
PP matrix. Thus, the catalytically active component is not capsulated
inside the melted polymer and therefore remains available for catalytic
reactions. The porosity and the dispersion of SiO2 particles
within the 3D-printed objects was also confirmed by using X-ray tomography
and SEM–energy-dispersive system (EDS) analysis which further
showed the even distribution of the particles (Figures S1–S4 and Table S2)

top and break surfaces of SLS 3D-printed stir bar covers (b–d).
The Pd/SiO2 catalyst can be seen as pale colored areas
with sharp edges in images (b–d).21

Thermal analysis of the 3D-printed
stir bar covers containing 10
wt % of Pd/SiO2 was conducted using thermogravimetry and
differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) (Figure S5). The results show that there is a mass change of roughly
−88% as the temperature is increased to 500 °C, after
which only a minimal change in the mass of the sample is observed.
Thus, the thermal behavior of the hybrid PdSiO2/PP material
is fully comparable to that of pure PP plastic.23 Because of the high thermal stability of the active silica-supported
palladium, it did not have any impact on the thermal behavior of the
printed object within the analyzed thermal range. Further characterization
of the PdSiO2/PP was also carried out by conducting powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurement of the material. The analysis
clearly shows the characteristics peaks of PP and Pd, while SiO2 is not clearly visible. This is probably due to the amorphous
nature of the SiO2. It is also plausible that the peaks
are masked by the dominating PP peaks (Figure S6). Additionally, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was used
to monitor for any changes in the PP network prior to and after the
printing process (Figures S7–S9).
No detectable changes were observed.

The catalytic activity
of the 3D-printed stir bar covers containing
10 wt % of Pd/SiO2 was tested in hydrogenation reactions.
Styrene, cyclohexene, and phenylacetylene were chosen as substrates
to test different types of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The reactions
were performed in a Teflon-lined autoclave under a hydrogen pressure
of 10 bar at room temperature for 2 h. The catalyst loading in the
reaction mixture was adjusted to 0.1 mol % in each case and the performance
of the printed catalyst was compared with the nonprinted Pd/SiO2 powder to study the impact of the printing process on the
activity of the catalyst. The resulting reaction mixtures were analyzed
using gas chromatography (GC) and the results are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 Reactions of Styrene, Cyclohexene,
and Phenylacetylene Catalyzed with Both 3D-Printed Catalyst Stir bar
Sleeves and the Powdery Pd/SiO2 Catalyst21
The results in Table 1 show that the 3D-printed
catalyst is able to catalyze the hydrogenation
of the chosen substrates effectively. A comparison of the data to
that obtained for the nonprinted Pd/SiO2 powder shows that
3D printing has only a minor effect on the total activity in the case
of styrene and phenylacetylene. For styrene, a 92.7% conversion was
obtained with nonprinted pure Pd/SiO2 powder (Table 1, reaction 2), while
a 3D-printed stir bar cover gave a 76.7% conversion under the same
conditions (Table 1, average of reactions 3–5). In the case of phenylacetylene,
the 3D-printed catalyst even achieved a slightly better conversion
(Table 1, reaction
11) than the nonprinted Pd/SiO2 powder (Table 1, reaction 10), 77.1 and 64.3%,
respectively. These data show that the catalytically active component
in the printed object is well achievable by styrene and phenylacetylene.
However, when cyclohexene was used as the substrate (Table 1, reactions 13 and 14), the
nonprinted powdery catalyst performed considerably better than the
3D-printed catalyst with a conversion of 69.2% versus 36.4%. This
is most likely due to the more sterically hindered double bond in
cyclohexene, which affects its ability to interact with the active
catalyst inside the pores of the supporting PP matrix. It should be
noted that the structure of the 3D-printed catalyst was not optimized
for any particular substrate. Therefore, a higher conversion could
be achieved by optimization of the porous structure of the catalyst.
Alternatively, the difference in activity between the powder and 3D-printed
catalysts could be compensated, at least partially, by adjusting the
reaction conditions.

Reusability of the 3D-printed catalyst
was tested in three consecutive
runs by using the styrene substrate (Table 1, reactions 3–5). Nearly identical
conversions, ranging from 76.4 to 77.3%, demonstrate the constant
behavior of the catalyst. However, the freshly printed objects must
be carefully cleaned before use, to remove any residual, unsintered
material. Need for this arises because of the SLS technique, where
the powder bed is supporting the forming object during printing and
the object is formed inside the powder bed and is therefore covered
with an unsintered material.24 The entries
6–8 in Table 1, show the impact of insufficient cleaning. The conversion of 84.1%
was obtained when a fresh catalyst was used. The conversion in the
second run was 81.2% and the final activity of 76.5% was obtained
only in the third run after residual unsintered material was completely
lost during the first two runs.

Leaching of palladium from the
3D-printed catalysts was investigated
under two different environments. First, samples from reaction mixtures
from catalytic runs were analyzed using ultrasound-assisted acidic
leaching, to dissolve any palladium particles present, after which
the amount of palladium was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma
optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES). The analyses showed
that under actual reaction conditions, only roughly 0.10 to 0.57 wt
% of the palladium present in the fresh 3D-printed stir bar sleeves
was leached to the reaction mixture (Table 2). For comparison, a similar leaching behavior
was observed also with the unprinted Pd/SiO2 powder (Table 2). This means that
a certain amount of Pd was leached from the active Pd/SiO2 component whether it was printed or not. However, it was also observed
that in some cases when the printed catalysts were reused several
times, leaching of Pd was higher when the freshly printed catalyst
was used. As already discussed, this is due to a small amount of residual,
unsintered material that was released during the first run. After
the loss of the unsintered material, leaching was considerably lowered
and at the same level as leaching from Pd/SiO2 powder.
In fact, in some cases printing may even protect the catalysts reducing
the amount of the leached catalyst.

Table 2 Total Amount of Palladium
Leached
into Reaction Mixture During Catalytic Reactions When Using Either
3D-Printed or Powderous Pd/SiO2 Catalysta
a The amount of palladium is calculated
by comparing the amount of leached palladium to the mass of the palladium
present in the used catalyst.

The anchoring of Pd/SiO2 to the supporting polymer was
also tested by placing the stir bar covers onto a stirring bar that
was stirred vigorously in boiling water for 60 min. Samples of the
resulting solutions were again taken and analyzed using ultrasound-assisted
acidic leaching in combination with ICP–OES. The results showed
that only 0.26 wt % of the total amount of palladium present in the
3D-printed catalysts was leached into the boiling water, which illustrates
that the catalytically active Pd/SiO2 is firmly attached
to the supporting matrix. The results also demonstrate the good abrasion
resistance of the 3D-printed stir bar covers as no noticeable wearing
was seen during the experiments.

Conclusions
We
have shown that SLS 3D printing can be utilized to produce porous,
efficient, easy-to-use, and reusable heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts
from a mixture of Pd/SiO2 powder and PP beads. The manufactured
catalytic objects were simple stir bar covers suitable for lab-scale
batch reactions, but the same printing technique can be easily scaled
up to fabricate tailor-made catalytically active objects for other
type of reactors and reaction environments. The results also showed
that the employed printing process does not have a significant impact
on the catalytic performance of the catalytically active additive.
Furthermore, SLS sets only minimal requirements for the printing materials,
and both the catalytically active component, as well as the supporting
matrix, can be altered in almost any fashion imaginable. The printed
catalytic objects showed good thermal and mechanical properties along
with good resistance to leaching of the catalytically active palladium
metal. We believe that 3D-printing can change the way we produce our
catalysts in the future.

Experimental Details
Chemicals and Materials
All organic reagents and solvents
were purchased from Merck and used as received without any additional
drying. Palladium on silica (Escat 1351) was purchased from Strem
and used as received. PP was obtained from ADVANC3D materials and
used without any additional pretreatment.

3D Printing of the Catalytic
Objects
The catalysts
objects were printed with the Sharebot SnowWhite SLS 3D printer. The
printing material was prepared by mixing 10 wt % of commercial supported
Pd/SiO2 (5% of Pd) catalyst powder with commercial PP powder
(particle size 50 μm). Highly porous and durable objects with
a diameter of 6.5 mm and length of 8.5 mm (Figure 1) were obtained using following printing
parameters: powder temperature: 122 °C, 40% laser power (14 W,
CO2 laser), 64 000 pps (2560 mm s–1) laser speed and 0.1 mm layer height. The 3D-printed objects were
thoroughly cleaned of any nonsintered powder after the printing process.
The objects were further cleansed by stirring them in water for 10
min before any catalysis runs.

Catalytic Studies
In each reaction, 7 mmol of the substrate,
styrene, cyclohexene, or phenylacetylene was introduced into a Teflon-lined
autoclave with 2 mL of methanol and the stir bar equipped with the
catalyst sleeves. The total Pd loading was adjusted to 0.1 mol % for
each reaction. Hydrogenation reactions were performed under 10 bar
hydrogen pressure at room temperature. The reaction time was 2 h.
Same reaction conditions were used also for the pure, nonprinted Pd/SiO2 powder.

Gas Chromatography
The samples were
analyzed using
the Agilent 7820A GC system equipped with Agilent HP-5 column. GC
samples were taken directly from the reaction mixture, diluted with
dichloromethane and analyzed without further processing of the sample.

Palladium Leaching Studies
Palladium content of the
reaction products was analyzed by placing 1 mL of the reaction mixture
into 10 mL digestion tube along with 1 mL of aqua regia. Ultrasound-assisted
digestion (6 times 5 min at 60 °C) was performed. The sample
was then diluted and analyzed using PerkinElmer 8300 ICP–OES
using procedure further discussed in the Supporting Information. The results are presented in Table 2. Mechanical binding of the
Pd/SiO2 into the 3D-printed objects was studied by placing
the catalyst sleeves on a stir bar and inserting them into 10 mL of
boiling water for 60 min. After stirring the solution vigorously for
60 min, the stir bar was removed. Aqua regia (5 mL) was added into
the water and ultrasound-assisted leaching (6 times 5 min at 60 °C)
was performed to dissolve any palladium particles present in the solution.
About 0.26% of the total amount of palladium present in the 3D-printed
catalyst sleeves was found to have leached into the water after the
experiment.

For the ICP–OES analyses, argon gas flow
of 15 mL/min was used with a sample flow rate of 1.5 L min–1, nebulizer gas flow of 0.7 L min–1 and auxiliary
gas flow of 0.2 L min–1. RF power of 1500 W was
used. Calibration standards were prepared by diluting PerkinElmer
1000 mg L–l spectroscopy standard. Palladium was
analyzed using a wavelength of 340.458 nm.

Helium Ion Microscopy
Imaging was performed with a
Carl Zeiss ORION NanoFab helium ion microscope. The beam energy used
was 30 keV and the beam was set between 0.31 and 0.32 pA. Dwell time
of 0.2 μs was used for the scans with a working distance of
8.4 mm. Samples were not treated in any way before imaging aside from
the use of pressurized air to clear any remaining loose particles
from the surfaces of the samples.

Powder X-ray Diffraction
X–ray powder diffraction
data were acquired by the PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer
in Bragg–Brentano geometry using Cu Kα1 radiation
(Johannsson type monochromator, λ = 1.5406 Å, 45 kV, 40
mA). The sample was prepared with a back-load technique into a shallow
cavity (28 mm diameter) on a steel made sample holder. The data was
recorded from a spinning sample by a X’Celerator detector using
continuous scanning mode in the 2θ range of 6°–90°
with a step size of 0.017° and counting time of 400 s per step
(4 h 30 min overall time). Diffraction data were processed with the
Malvern PANalytical HighScore Plus v. 4.7 program.
