The
CD44 receptor is common among
many cancer types where overexpression is synonymous with poor prognosis
in prostate, glioma, and breast cancer. More notably CD44 overexpression
has been shown in a number of different cancer stem cells (CSC) which
are present in many solid tumors and drive growth, recurrence, and
resistance to conventional therapies. Triple negative breast cancer
CSCs correlate to worse prognosis and early relapse due to higher
drug resistance and increased tumor heterogeneity and thus are prime
targets for anticancer therapy. To specifically target cells overexpressing
CD44 receptors, including CSCs, we synthesized a pentameric nanocomplex
(PNC) containing gold nanoparticles, doxorubicin (Dox) conjugated
to thiolated hyaluronic acid via an acid-labile hydrazone bond, and
thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) DNA CD44 aptamer. In vitro drug release
was highest at 8 h time point at acidic pH (pH 4.7) and in 10 mM glutathione.
The PNC is almost an order of magnitude more effective than Dox alone
in CD44+ cells versus CD44 low cells. Functionally, the PNC reduced
CSC self-renewal. The PNC provides a therapeutic strategy that can
improve the efficiency of Dox and decrease nontargeted toxicity thereby
prolonging its use to individual patients.

Introduction
Targeting cell surface
receptors that are overexpressed only under
disease conditions is a common strategy used to specifically target
cancer cells for anticancer drug delivery.1 One such receptor is CD44, which is a transmembrane protein that
mediates communication and adhesion among cells, interactions between
cell and extracellular matrix, cell migration, and cell survival and
growth.2 This receptor,
which binds hyaluronic acid (HA), is overexpressed in many types of
cancers, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC),3,4 hepatocellular carcinoma,5 colon,6,7 head and neck,8 and ovarian.9,10 CD44 is also expressed in TNBC cancer stem cells (CSCs), and it
is known that the presence of CSCs has a high correlation with tumor
progression and early recurrence.4,10−14 Sole targeting of the tumorigenic regions is considered to be insufficient
for the treatment of aggressive tumors, especially in the case of
late stage cancers.15−18 Triple negative breast cancers make up 15–20% of all breast
cancers and are characterized by high rates of early relapse within
the first 5 years because of drug resistance and the heterogeneous
nature of the disease.19,20 Current treatment mechanisms
consisting of chemotherapeutics, such as anthracyclines, taxanes,
and platinum-based drugs, rarely achieve a pathologically complete
response (pCR) in patients with TNBC.21

Targeted nanoparticle delivery systems have the unique ability
to overcome the wide variations in tumorigenic cells along with negative
side effects of anticancer small molecules.22−26 One characteristic that makes the nanoparticle delivery
systems advantageous when compared with free drug treatment is passive
targeting through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR), where
circulating particles can readily accumulate in tumors due to their
porous epithelial cell lining.27 Specifically,
PEGylated gold nanoparticles (AuNP) have been shown to collect more
efficiently on the basis of their hydrodynamic size, with sizes ranging
from 60 to 80 nm being the most effective.28 To further accentuate specific cellular targeting, nanoparticles
have been designed to incorporate multiple functionalities, such as
photodynamic therapy,29 drug release through
sulfide ligand exchange,30 small molecule
acid-labile release,31,32 delivery of synergistic anticancer
drugs33 and cellular targeting through
conjugated aptamers and antibodies.34−36 Among the variations
of nanoparticles used for drug delivery, AuNPs have been used extensively
for their characteristic biological inertness,37 controllable size,38 and a thiolphilic
surface for ligand interactions.39

Because of the versatility in the number of ways HA can be used,
there are many reports of CD44-targeted nanoparticle complexes.40−43 Specifically, Hammond et al. used HA as a coating agent for CD44-targeted
layer by layer nanoparticles for the codelivery of chemotherapeutic
agents and siRNA.44 Other examples have
used HA as the scaffold for polymeric nanoparticles, which can deliver
conjugated small molecules45 and RNA.26 In recent years, nanoparticles have been used
to target CD44 overexpressing CSCs.5,46,47 However, a major drawback of most of the current
clinical strategies is their inability to effectively kill CSCs that
are instrumental in maintaining tumor drug resistance and a protumorigenic
microenvironment. We have designed and synthesized a pentameric nanoparticle
complex (PNC) for targeted drug delivery of doxorubicin (Dox) for
overexpressing CD44 tumorgenic cells and TNBC CSCs to achieve improved
cytotoxicity compared with the free drug. The five-component PNC looks
to combine strategies of inorganic and polymeric nanoparticles by
incorporating thiolated HA to stabilize AuNP and for increased drug
loading, while using a CD44 DNA aptamer for cellular targeting. We
believe that this will serve as a novel platform that could be used
to specifically target TNBC CSCs and potentially improve upon current
treatment strategies.

Results and Discussion
Establishing the Identity
of the Five-Part (Pentameric) Nanocomplex
To target the CD44
positive cancer cells and the triple negative
breast cancer stem cells (TNBC CSCs) we designed and synthesized a
PNC, so named because the nanocomplex is comprised of five components.
The PNC utilized optimized functionalities to address two major criticisms
common to effective drug delivery: (i) targeting of cancerous cells
to reduce potential life-threatening side effects and (ii) loading
enough drug molecules to elicit an effective dose response. A schematic
of the PNC is shown in Figure 1 consisting of Dox conjugated to the naturally occurring polysaccharide
hyaluronic acid (HA) and a thiol containing PEGylated CD44 DNA phosphorothioate
aptamer capable of specifically delivering small molecule drugs to
cells with overexpression of CD44. The CD44 phosphorothioate aptamer48 is a targeting ligand specifically selected
to bind to the CD44 receptor, enhancing the recognition of cells that
overexpress these receptors. The phosphorothioate-modified aptamer
was used to provide stability against nucleases, making it advantageous
for use with nanoparticle drug delivery with potentially long circulation
times.49 To maximize drug loading while
maintaining controlled intracellular release, the HA polymer was first
thiolated at the reducing end to facilitate binding onto the AuNP
surface and then conjugated to Dox that led to multiple drug loading
per polymer molecule. This scheme maximized the availability of functional
groups for drug loading in comparison to many of the previously reported
polymeric nanoparticle complexes, where available functional groups
were lost due to cross-linking.50 Our nanoparticle
complex also offers an advantage in terms of drug loading compared
with inorganic nanoparticles, which needs a mixture of stabilizing
ligands and drugs on the nanoparticle surface, resulting in the stabilizing
ligands occupying valuable drug binding sites. An acid-labile hydrazone
bond connects each of the drug molecules to the polymer, which preferentially
breaks in acidic pH environment found in lysosomal compartments of
cells. Additionally, cancer cells often have lower intracellular pH
(∼5.8–7) which may also help in the release of the drug
molecule.51 The complex combines the ability
of the AuNP to undergo high drug loading with the precision of aptamer
recognition of cell surface receptors for more efficient drug delivery.

borohydride reduction method. The average particle size was measured
as 4.2 ± 1 nm. Bottom right. Each component was mixed to form
the PNC (AuNP + HASH/Dox-PEGylated CD44 aptamer).

On the basis of previous reports, we decided to use a sub
5 nm
AuNP because of its desirable physical traits, which makes it suitable
to act as the core of the PNC. This smaller size has been shown to
be better for the post drug release excretion of the naked nanoparticles,
for example, clearance through the pores of the kidney that are 5
nm in diameter.52 We synthesized AuNP by
the reduction of HAuCl3 with NaBH4. The size
of the nanoparticles was determined by UV–vis spectrophotometry
(Figure S1), TEM (Figures 1(iii) and S2),
and dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Table 1). The TEM and DLS data indicate that the
synthesized nanoparticles were an average of 4.2 and 3.7 nm in size,
respectively. The size measurement from multiple preparations demonstrated
that the size of the synthesized nanoparticles is very similar, indicating
the reproducibility of our method (Table S1).

was tested in triplets using a Nanoanalyzer DLS machine.

To improve cellular specificity
of the nanoparticle complex, a
targeting aptamer for CD44 would have to be appropriately attached
to the nanoparticle, ensuring its availability to recognize the targeted
protein, the CD44 receptor. To accomplish this, a DNA aptamer was
synthesized with an amine-functionalized linker at the 3′ end
to facilitate conjugation via the −COOH of a bifunctional poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) (5 kDa) using an N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS)-ester cross-coupling.53 Successful PEGylation of the aptamer was detected (Figure 1(ii), lanes 2 and
3) by analysis on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel that showed
its slower migration in comparison to that of the free aptamer (Figure 1(ii), lane 1). The
slower migration of the PEGylated aptamer was expected because of
the addition of a 5 kDa PEG. A mutant version of the PEGylated aptamer
was synthesized using identical chemical strategy. Incorporation of
the thiolated-PEG-aptamer in PNC was detected by using a radiolabeled
version of the CD44 aptamer, which was then mixed with the “naked”
AuNP, followed by HASH-Dox (Figure 2). Analysis of the products on an 1% agarose gel showed
the presence of the free conjugated aptamer (Figure 2, lane 1), labeled PNC (Figure 2, lane 2) and unlabeled PNC
(Figure 2, lane 3).
A substantial reduction in the migration of the labeled PEG-aptamer
in lane 2 compared to that of the free radiolabeled PEG-aptamer in
lane 1 implies that its mostly a part of the PNC. Quantification using
Image J showed ∼1.35 nmol aptamer was complexed to approximately
each nmol of AuNP, indicating ∼90% loading. The same experiment
was performed except the order of polymer addition was switched, meaning
the labeled aptamer was added after the addition of the HASH-Dox (Figure S3). In this scenario, incorporation of
the aptamer into the complex was about 50%, indicating the importance
of the order of addition of each component during the preparation
of the PNC. To further establish that the PEG-aptamer is indeed a
part of the PNC, we compared the migration of AuNP-HASHDox versus
that of the PNC complex in 1% agarose gel (Figure S4). The PNC was observed to run slower than the AuNP-HASHDox,
which can be explained if we consider that the HASH-Dox is about 10
kDa, whereas the PEG-aptamer conjugate is about 14 kDa in size, presumably
creating a larger nanoparticle (as discussed later, the DLS data also
corroborates these data).

Figure 2 PEGylated CD44 aptamer is conjugated to the
PNC complex show though

PEGylated CD44 aptamer, the PNC complex with radiolabeled PEGylated
CD44 aptamer, and a nonlabeled PEGylated CD44 PNC complex ran in 1%
agarose gel. (Right) Phosphoimage of the same gel, showing the migration
of the labeled aptamer is dependent on AuNP conjugation.

For drug loading and stability of the PNC, we utilized
the naturally
occurring polysaccharide HA that has been used in a variety of biomaterial.54−56 To facilitate binding onto the AuNP, HA molecules were thiolated
at their reducing end and subsequently conjugated to multiple Dox
molecules via an acid-labile Schiff base linkage. Briefly, the −COOH
groups of HA were modified with adipic dihydrazide (ADH) and the azide
was linked to Dox, forming a Schiff base linkage (HASH-Dox, Figure 1(i)). This allowed
incorporation of two important functionalities: (i) a controllable
acid-labile release mechanism that results in limited release at physiological
pH during extracellular circulation thus potentially reducing nonspecific
drug cytotoxicity and (ii) more available functionalities for drug
loading outside the AuNP surface. The HASH-Dox loading was quantified
using the characteristic Dox peak at 490 nm measured by UV–vis
spectrophotometry (Figure S5). Also, HASH-Dox
polymer was shown to be fully loaded, as no visible HASH-Dox could
be assessed after dialysis. Together, these showed that there are
100 HASH-Dox polymers loaded per nanoparticle based on the conjugated
conditions and full loading. To further confirm conjugation of HA
to Dox, we used NMR and IR to verify the formation of the hydrazone
linkage between the two components in the final HASH-Dox polymer (Figures S6–S9). The presence of Dox on
the HASH polymer was observed via 1H NMR spectrum, which
showed the characteristic resonances for Dox at 1.2, 1.9, 2.2, 2.8,
and 2.9 ppm which were absent in the HASH 1H NMR spectrum
(see Figures S6 and S7).57−60 Additionally, IR spectrophotometry
has been performed on these complexes and the HASH-Dox showed characteristics
that can be ascribed to imine formation (see Figures S8 and S9). In the HASH-Dox polymer, peaks ranging from 1650
to 1750 nm were observed, whereas no increase at 1654 nm was detected
in the HASH-ADH polymer spectrum, indicating the Dox conjugation to
the adipic dihydrazide via hydrazone bonding. Many nanoparticle complexes
tether small molecules to the gold surface, creating potential competition
for nanoparticle space with the stabilizing ligands.29,61 For example, in a previous report Dox was directly loaded on 5 nm
AuNP and the loading was about 150 molecules per AuNP, whereas in
our case, using the HA for drug loading we detected about 270 per
AuNP (4.2 nm).61

For the conjugate
to be therapeutically viable, the PNC has to
remain stable at physiological conditions. Stability studies with
PNC in concentrations ranging from 10 mM to 1 M NaCl salt solution
were performed to increase the stringency of the assay. The aggregation
was assessed visually and via UV–vis spectrophotometry, where
the 515 nm peak was monitored. It has been observed that AuNP instability
and aggregation would cause a redshift and broadening of the AuNP
UV peak (Figure S10).62 All nanocomplexes showed stability in 1 M NaCl, which greatly
exceeds the blood salt concentrations (∼150 mM), showing the
HASH-Dox polymer is extremely stable even at high salt.63 Besides stability, the sizing of the nanoparticle
is also important for effective tumor and cell targeting. It has been
shown that polymer-coated gold nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter
of 60–80 nm collect most readily in tumor sites through EPR.64,65 Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), zeta potential, and polydispersity
index (PDI) were
used to verify the size and charge of the PNC after addition of each
component (Tables 1,S2 and S3). The low molecular weight
HASH showed a diameter of 160 nm when coated onto AuNP. Hyaluronic
acid is highly charged due to the low pKa of the free carboxyl groups having a zeta potential of −44.1
mV.66 However, the AuNP-HASHDox diameter
(50 nm) was distinctly smaller, perhaps due to interactions between
the conjugated Dox and unreacted HA functional groups. The primary
amine of Dox has been reported to have pKa1 from 7.86 to 8.4.67 At pH 6.5 it has
been reported that electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions
between the amine of Dox and intrapolymer carboxyl groups can occur,
which we believe is the case here between unconjugated HA carboxylate
and Dox.68 Packing may also occur due to
Dox–Dox stacking via π–π interactions.68 Presumably, the packing, along with other chemical
reactions described above resulted in the compacted size of the AuNP-HASHDox
(50 nm), which is in the same size range as that of the AuNP-PEG (48
nm). The increase in diameter of the PNC (60 nm), the only complex
with the aptamer, compared to that of the AuNP-HASHDox confirms not
only the conjugation of the aptamer to the PEG but also the positioning
of the aptamer, which most likely protrudes outside of the polymer
shell. This boded well for the aptamer function as it made it more
available, thus facilitating interactions with the targeted cellular
receptor. The PDI of the nanoparticle conjugates were calculated from
the DLS values and are shown in Table S3. The change in the zeta potential values provided further evidence
of the effect of conjugation resulting presumably from intramolecular
nanoparticle interactions (Table S2). The
conjugation of Dox to the HA polymer caused a decrease in the negative
charge of AuNP-HASH (from −44.1 to −18.5 mV). The full
complex had a zeta potential value (−29.0 mV) that is more
negatively charged than that of the AuNP-HASHDox because of the addition
of the DNA aptamer.

Pentameric Nanoparticle Complex Releases
Doxorubicin in a Controlled
Fashion
A prominent flaw in Dox and many cancer chemotherapeutic
agents is the nonspecific cytotoxicity of circulating drugs, for example,
the increased cardiovascular risk associated with Dox.69 The presence of the acid-labile hydrazone linkage
between HA and Dox provides a controllable release mechanism from
the PNC at lysosomal pH (∼pH 4.5) or lower intracellular pH
associated with cancer cells. The PNC contains thiol-linked components
(HASH-Dox) that can be released in the presence of the cellular glutathione
at intracellular levels of 10 mM in comparison to extracellular concentration
which is 1–3 orders of magnitude lower.70,71 Therefore, in vitro analysis mimicking conditions found in the cytoplasm
and intracellular compartments of the cytoplasm, such as early endosome
(pH 7.0 with 10 mM glutathione), lysosome (pH 4.5 with and without
10 mM glutathione), and extracellular conditions found in the blood
stream (pH 7.0) were performed. In each of the conditions mentioned
above, the PNC was centrifuged to pellet the nanoparticles and the
supernatant was measured by UV–vis spectrophotometry at 490
nm to determine the Dox concentration (Figure S11). At pH 7.0, minimal release was observed over the 8 h
period. However, at pH 4.5 there was increased release over all of
the time points tested when compared to the release observed at pH
7.0. Doxorubicin was released in higher amounts in the acidic conditions
compared to that in the intracellular condition of pH 7.0. The above
data indicated that the acid-labile release was more efficient than
the glutathione-mediated thiol exchange under cellular conditions.
At a condition that triggered both acidic and glutathione-mediated
release mechanisms, an additive effect was observed at 8 h of incubation
but not at the 4 h time point, suggesting that the breakage of the
acid-labile hydrazone bond happened more efficiently than the effect
of glutathione. The PNC was incubated with excess β-mercaptoethanol
to achieve full release of the thiolated polymers (HASH-Dox and PEG-aptamer)
from AuNP, and the amount of Dox was measured after 24 h. Interestingly,
the PNC samples incubated in pH 4.5 alone and pH 4.5 with 10 mM glutathione
released 66 and 95% of loaded Dox, respectively. These compared well
to the previously reported values obtained from a similar acid-labile
thiolated Dox release mechanism.61

Pentameric
Nanoparticle Complex Preferentially Taken Up by CD44-Expressing
Cancer Cells
The PNC was designed to specifically target
CD44 overexpressing cancer and stem cells. To test the efficiency
of cellular uptake of the PNC, we tested two cells lines, a known
CD44 positive cell line HeLa and NIH3T3, a cell line known for low
CD44 expression. The cells were incubated with Dox, HASH-Dox, PNC,
and mutant PNC (contained a randomized version of the DNA aptamer
sequence) for 12 h in 1 μM Dox. The cells were washed with full
media and immediately viewed under a confocal microscope to determine
the intracellular Dox signal. Doxorubicin, HASH-Dox, and the PNC all
showed substantially higher Dox signal in the CD44 overexpressing
HeLa cells, when compared to the Dox signal in the mutant PNC-treated
cells. The lower Dox signal in the mutant PNC-treated HeLa cells suggested
aptamer-mediated targeting (Figure 3). Without the targeting aptamer, the mutant PNC would
probably be too large for high levels of endocytosis.72,73 Additionally, the overall negative charge of the PNC is detrimental
to nonspecific cellular uptake.74 The targeted
delivery of the Dox was further investigated by treating the low CD44-expressing
NIH3T3 cells. Compared with Dox alone, all three Dox complexes (HASH-Dox,
PNC, and mutant PNC) exhibited substantially lower uptake (Figure S12), indicating the essential nature
of the CD44 receptor for the cellular delivery of conjugated Dox.
Thus, the use of the larger nanoparticle complex paired with a targeting
aptamer allowed for uptake comparable to that of free Dox with enhanced
cellular selectivity that has the potential to greatly reduce off
target side effects.

Figure 3 Cellular uptake of Dox is shown to be manipulated based
on availability
of CD44 aptamer and nanoparticle conjugation. Confocal images of HeLa
cells after 12 h of treatment with (top) doxorubicin and HASH-Dox
(bottom) PNC and mutant PNC at 1 μM.

Hyaluronic acid had been used as a targeting molecule because
it
is the cognate ligand for the CD44 receptor.75 However, in the PNC, the role of HA is to act as a drug loading
polymer and stabilizer of the AuNP. That the HA did not play any role
in cellular uptake of the complex was established by the observation
that the mutant PNC showed very little cellular uptake in CD44 overexpressing
cells. Thus, the enhanced uptake of the PNC is solely due to the presence
of the CD44 aptamer and not HA. Additionally, the increased drug loading
on the HA may also compromise the binding to the CD44 receptor. The
HA can also interact with the conjugated Dox, as discussed previously,
further reducing its ability to bind to the CD44 receptor. Thus, for
the reasons stated above, HA most likely acted as a polymeric drug-loaded
scaffold and not a targeting ligand.

Pentameric Nanoparticle
Complex Demonstrates Selective Cellular
Toxicity
To investigate the functional consequence of cell
specific targeting, we examined differences in cellular viability
when treated with the PNC, mutant PNC, and free Dox. Known CD44 overexpressing
tumorigenic cell lines SKOV-3, C13, and HeLa were used to test cell
specific toxicity, whereas NIH3T3 and SH-SY5Y cell lines were chosen
as negative controls. Cellular viability
assays using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium,
inner salt analysis showed that the PNC outperformed the mutant PNC
in CD44 overexpressing cell lines (Figure S13), whereas control cells showed similar viability in presence of
the compounds that were tested. In CD44 overexpressing cell lines,
SKOV-3 had a 4.5-fold increase in cell cytotoxicity based upon the
fact that the PNC and mutant PNC had IC50 values of 62
versus 270 nM, respectively (Figure S14). The PNC had a similar preference for the CD44 overexpressing C13,
a cisplatin-resistant A2008 ovarian cancer cell line, and HeLa when
compared with the mutant complex. The IC50 values for C13
were 168 and 462 nM (Figure S15), whereas
for HeLa they were 138 and 315 nM (Figure 4) for the active PNC and mutant, respectively.
However, virtually no differences in cell viability were observed
in the control cell lines. The IC50 values for PNC and
mutant PNC were found to be 57 and 59 nM in NIH3T3 and 600 and 700
nM SH-SY5Y cells, respectively (Figures S16 and S17), indicating virtually no difference in cytotoxicity of
the two nanocomplexes.

Figure 4 PNC complex is equally as cytotoxic as Dox in HeLa cells.
Cellular
viability study of HeLa cells treated with PNC, mutant PNC, and Dox.
Experiments were performed in triplicates and IC50 values
were calculated using a MTS assay 72 h post treatment.

Because of differences that may potentially exist
in the extent
of cellular endocytosis among different cell lines, IC50 values of the PNC were normalized against the IC50 values
for the free Dox for each of the cell lines that was tested (Figure 5, top). In the case
of the CD44 overexpressing cell lines, the PNC was equal to or more
efficient than free Dox. However, when comparing such values to low
CD44-expressing cell lines, the PNC showed values 2- and 5-fold less
than the values for free Dox, indicating that overall the PNC is better
in targeted delivery of the Dox to the CD44 overexpressing cell lines.
The comparison between the IC50 values of the PNC versus
the mutant complex further indicates the effectiveness of the CD44
aptamer (Figure 5,
middle). Cells lines that overexpressed CD44 showed that the PNC was
2–4 times more lethal than the mutant PNC; however, interestingly,
the two complexes were equally cytotoxic to the low CD44-expressing
cell lines. The cytotoxicity was observed to drop between 2- and 4-fold
in all cell lines when the values of the mutant PNC was compared to
those of free Dox, indicating that the mutant PNC has lower cytotoxicity
(Figure 5, bottom).
Together, these results showed two important paradigms that demonstrated
the functional effectiveness of this nanoparticle system. Doxorubicin,
along with many other chemotherapeutic small molecules, can passively
diffuse through the cell membrane, making entry favorable.76,77 The large size of the PNC most likely made normal endocytosis unfavorable
as the membrane presumably is not able to fully engulf the nanoparticles,78,79 which is bypassed by use of the CD44 aptamer to participate in a
receptor-mediated endocytosis. The nanoparticle system showed that
it can be advantageous in the reduction of passive diffusion of Dox
in nontargeted cells while being readily taken up in targeted cells.

Figure 5 PNC complex
is more cytotoxic than Dox in CD44 overexpressing cancer
cells while showing an aptamer-dependent reduction in toxicity in
low CD44-expressing CD44 cells. A comparison of MTS IC50 of the PNC, mutant PNC, and Dox in five separate cell lines varying
in the CD44 expression were compared. (Top) The PNC IC50 was normalized against Dox, signifying the PNC complex outperforms
Dox in cells with CD44 overexpression (+) and being less effective
in low CD44-expressing cells (−). (Middle) PNC was 2–4.2
times more effective in CD44+ cells while maintaining the same cytotoxicity
in low CD44-expressing cells, showing the dependence on the CD44 aptamer
incorporation in the PNC. (Bottom) Across all cell lines, Dox was
roughly 2–4.3 times more cytotoxic than the mutant PNC, representing
the potential reduction in nonspecific target cytotoxicity.

PNC Reduces Self-Renewal
On the basis of the reduction
in proliferation of CD44-expressing cancer cells, we wanted to evaluate
if self-renewal could be impacted by the PNC. We utilized a TNBC CSC
reporter system we developed whereby the CSC state is measured via
the activity of the NANOG promoter-driven green fluorescence protein
expression. When we treated CSCs with the PNC, we observed a reduction
in self-renewal and the stem cell frequency from 1 in 14.9 to 1 in
25 with 20 nM PNC and 1 in 23.6 to 1 in 43.6 with 200 nM PNC in CSCs
as compared with control treatment, with doxorubicin alone (Figure 6A). However, this
reduction was not observed in non-CSCs (Figure 6B). Taken together, these data suggest that
the PNC has the capacity to attenuate CSC self-renewal. As CSCs are
becoming increasingly important in understanding and treating the
tumorigenic environment, research on other therapeutic approaches
has been achieved. An investigation using a combinatorial EpCAM aptamer-siRNA
conjugate to sensitize CSCs showed improved Dox effectiveness in vivo.80 Another report explored a Docetaxel-modified
HA drug conjugate, showing a slight improvement in MCF-7 CSCs versus
normal MCF-7 cells but almost a 2-fold decrease in efficacy compared
to that of the free drug,81 wherein the
investigated PNC displayed the same efficacy compared to that of the
free drug at a 10-fold reduction in concentration in the tested TNBC
CSCs. This highlights the potential role the PNC has as an improved
vehicle for chemotherapeutic targeting of CSCs and its role in the
potential-improved tumorigenic treatment.

Figure 6 PNC is more cytotoxic
in CD44+ CSCs compared to free drug. The
limiting dilution assay performed on (A) CD44+ CSCs and (B) CD44–
CSCs in the presence of PNC and free Dox. The PNC complex showed similar
efficacy as that of Dox at a 10-fold reduction in concentration when
comparing sphere initiation frequency across concentrations.

Conclusions
In
summary, we designed and synthesized a PNC that is stable in
high salt and selectively delivers small molecule chemotherapeutics
to CD44+ cancer cells and CSCs. The naturally occurring polymer HA
helped increase the drug loading as well as provided stability to
the AuNP, preventing its precipitation in salt. By using a dual derivatized
HA polymer, we were able to eliminate competition for drug and polymer
loading on the gold surface while facilitating a controllable release
mechanism with acid-labile hydrazone bonds on the HA, which allowed
their release at low lysosomal pH and in the presence of physiologically
relevant glutathione concentration. Cellular uptake and cell viability
data demonstrated the role of the PEGylated DNA aptamer in targeting
CD44 cell surface receptor-containing cancer cells. Remarkably, the
active PNC showed almost an order of magnitude advantage between the
CD44+ cells versus the cells that express CD44 poorly. A 10-fold advantage
in Dox efficacy can be highly beneficial in its use, as the reported
cardiotoxicity limits its utility as an anticancer agent. Finally,
the PNC was able to show a distinct cytotoxic effect on the CSCs in
comparison with the mutant PNC. This will provide an additional benefit
in terms of anticancer efficacy of the PNC. Overall, a novel five-part
nanocomplex showed selective cytotoxicity toward CD44+ cancer and
CSCs in combination with its reduced cytotoxicity toward nontargeted
cells making the PNC a powerful anticancer drug delivery system.56

Experimental Section
High molecular
weight hyaluronic acid was purchased from Glycosan
Biosystems (Salt Lake, UT). Bifunctionalized poly(ethylene glycol)
with thiol and amine functionalizations, N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), sodium borohydride, deuterium
oxide (D2O), and bovine hyaluronidase were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich; doxorubicin hydrochloride, auric chloride (HAuCl3), and adipic dihydrazide were purchased from Fischer Scientific.
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 4.5 and
1 mg/mL l-glutamine, RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine,
fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Worldwide Medical Supplies.
CD44-directed DNA aptamer and the randomized version of the aptamer
sequence were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). The
Milli-Q water used in all experiments was obtained from a three-stage
Millipore Milli-Q plus 185 purification system (Millipore Corporation),
with a resistivity greater than 18.2 MΩ cm.

Preparation of Gold Nanoparticles
HAuCl3 (1.25 mL, 50 mM) in 125 mL of deionized water
was added to 1.4 mL
of a sodium borohydride (52 mM)–NaOH (500 mM) solution and
stirred overnight. The clear solution turned into a dark red color
characteristic of smaller size gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The solution
was then filter-sterilized using a 0.2 μm cellulose acetate
filter (Corning). Ten kilodalton membrane cutfoff 50 mL centrifuge
tubes were used to concentrate the nanoparticle solution to 2 mL.
The particle size was then analyzed by UV–vis spectrophotometry,
TEM, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). A known molar extinction
coefficient was used to obtain nanoparticle concentration via UV–vis
spectrophotometry.

Preparation of Thiolated Low Molecular Weight
Hyaluronic Acid
High molecular weight (∼500 kDa) HA
was subjected to degradation
by bovine hyaluronidase according to a previously published procedure.82 Briefly, 2 g of high molecular weight HA was
dissolved in 500 mL of phosphate-buffered saline pH 6.5 containing
bovine hyaluronidase (10 units/mg of HA). The digestion was carried
out at 37 °C for 24 h, after which the bovine hyaluronidase was
inactivated by heating the solution to 95 °C for 20 min. The
resulting solution was then filter-sterilized using a 0.2 μm
cellulose acetate filter. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed in
a 3.5 kDa MWCO cellulose acetate membrane to remove salts. The dialyzed
solution was then filtered using a 30 kDa Amicon filter. The collected
flow-through was then lyophilized overnight to obtain low molecular
weight HA, with an approximate size range of 3.5–30 kDa. The
low molecular weight HA was then thiolated at the reducing end using
a modified version of a previously published procedure.42 Forty five milligrams of 3.5–30 kDa HA
and 60 mg of cystamine were dissolved in 50 mL of borate-buffered
saline at pH 8.5 to facilitate the formation of the Schiff’s
base intermediate. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h, after which the Schiff’s base was reduced to the
stable imine by the addition of sodium cyanoborohydride (380 mg).
The reduction reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 24 h in the
dark. Cystamine disulfide linkages were then reduced by the addition
of 10 M equivalents of dithiothreitol with respect to cystamine. Salts
and excess reagents were removed by dialysis using a 3.5 kDa MWCO
membrane. The resulting end thiolated, low molecular weight HA solution
was lyophilized to obtain a white cotton-like solid. The level of
end thiolation of HA was then determined using Ellman’s method,
a colorimetric assay commonly used to detect free thiols, according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Scientific). The molecular
weight of the digested and filter HASH was assessed to be 10 kDa.

Synthesis of Modified Thiolated Hyaluronic Acid and Its Conjugation
to Doxorubicin
End thiolated HA was modified by reacting
to adipic dihydrazide. Hundred milligrams of HASH was added to 20
mL of 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer
(pH 4.4), 100 mg of EDC, and 1.2 g of adipic dihydrazide. The solution
was covered and stirred for 5 days. The reaction was then purified
through dialysis using 3.5 kDa cutoff dialysis bags for 3 days, changing
the water every 12 h. The remaining solution was then lypholized till
a dry product was formed, which is covered and stored at −20
°C. Fifteen milligrams of the product (HASH-ADH) was added to
5 mL of water, 50 μL of glacial acetic acid, and 2.5 mg of Dox.
The solution was covered and stirred for 5 days. Afterward, the reaction
was purified via dialysis using a 3.5 kDa dialysis bag for 3 days
against water, changing water every 12 h. The remaining solution was
then lyophilized till a dry product was formed, which was covered
and stored at −20 °C. UV–vis spectrophotometry,
NMR, and infrared spectrometry were performed to establish Dox conjugation
and Schiff base formation.

Poly(ethylene glycol) Aptamer Conjugation
3′-Amine-functionalized
CD44 thioaptamer (CCA*A*GGCCTGCA*A*GGGA*A*CCA*A*GGA*CA*CA*G/3AmMO/) and mutant aptamer (NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN/3AmMO/)
were purchased from IDT. A 1.5:1 molar ratio (PEG to DNA) was mixed
with excess of EDC and NHS in water over 24 h at room temperature
to perform a coupling reaction. The PEG-conjugated aptamer was purified
via 10 kDa MWCO centrifuge tubes. The conjugation was later established
via a gel shift assay.

Synthesis of the Pentameric Nanocomplex (PNC)
One AuNP
to 1.5 PEG-aptamer molar ratio was added and shaken for 15 min. Hundred
microliters of a 5 mg/mL solution of HASH-Dox was added to the solution
and shaken overnight. The PNC was purified by dialysis with 100 000
kDa MWCO centrifuge tubes (Millipore).

Dynamic Light Scattering
(DLS) and Zeta Potential Measurements
The nanoparticle size
was measured using a Nanopartica Nanoparticle
Analyzer SZ-100 (Horiba Scientific). For size measurement, 5 μL
of each sample (AuNP, AuNP-HASH, AuNP-HASHDox, PNC, and AuNP-PEG)
were diluted up to 2 mL with water (pH 6.5) in 3 mL cuvettes. Size
measurements were performed thrice with each trial done in triplicates,
which then were averaged. For zeta potential measurements, the samples
were diluted in water and dispersed in the zeta potential capsules.
The samples were measured by using a Nanopartica Nanoparticle Analyzer
SZ-100 (Horiba Scientific).

Detection of Nanoparticle Complexes by Agarose
Gel
The 5′-end-radiolabeled single-stranded oligonucleotides
were
prepared by reacting the DNA with T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) and
[γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer) for 45 min at 37 °C.
The radiolabeled DNA oligonucleotides were purified by 17% denaturing
PAGE and extracted from the gel via the crush and soak method. The
labeled aptamer was conjugated onto the nanoparticle. The samples
were analyzed on an 1% agarose gel. The gel was exposed to a phosphorimager
screen and then visualized by Typhoon Phosphorimager FLA 9500 (GE
Healthcare, Life Sciences).

Stability of the Pentameric Nanoparticle
Complex in Salt
Five microliters of the PNC was added to
varying concentrations of
NaCl solutions starting at 10 mM and ending 1 M. The samples were
incubated for 12 h at room temperature. Nanoparticle stability was
visually assessed in comparison to a no salt control, along with UV–vis
readings comparing any shifts at the AuNP peak maxima.

Release of
Doxorubicin from the Pentameric Nanoparticle Complex
Solutions
of the sample PNC (25 μL) were incubated with phosphate-buffered
saline (75 μL) at pH 7.4 and pH 5.0 or phosphate buffer (65
μL) at pH 7.4 and pH 5.0 with 100 mM glutathione (10 μL)
for various time points. To achieve full drug release, 25 μL
of the sample of PNC was incubated with 75 μL of β-mercaptethonal
for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged at 16 000 rpm to pellet AuNPs.
The concentration of the released doxorubicin in the supernatant was
then measured by UV–vis spectrophotometry. The percentage of
drug release for each sample was then calculated as the percent absorbance
at 490 nm (absorbance maxima of doxorubicin) compared to the full
drug release control.

Antiproliferative Activity of the Pentameric
Nanoparticle Complex
via MTS assay
Antiproliferative activities of the nanocomplexes
were tested using HeLa, SKOV-3, C13, NIH3T3, and SH-SY5Y cell lines.
SKOV-3 cells were cultured in RPMI media, C13 and SH-SY5Y were cultured
with Eagle’s minimal essential medium, and HeLa and NIH3T3
cells were cultured with low glucose DMEM. All media were supplemented
with FBS (10% by volume) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/mL).
The cells were seeded and grown overnight in a 96-well plate at a
density of 3000 cells per well at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in
a humidified incubator. Cells were then treated with media containing
various concentrations of nanocomplexes or Dox for 72 h. Cell viability
was then analyzed using the CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell
Proliferation Assay (MTS) according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Promega). All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Cellular Uptake
Detection by Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy
HeLa and NIH3T3
cells were seeded overnight at a density of 10 000
and 25 000 cells per well, respectively, in an eight-well chamber
slide. Cells were then treated for 12 h with media containing 1 μM
of either Dox, HASH-Dox, PNC, or mutant PNC. The cells were then washed
three times with full growth media and immediately analyzed for intracellular
Dox distribution under an Olympus 1000× confocal microscope.

Limiting Dilution Assay
MDA-MB-231 NANOG-GFP cells
were prepared as previously described4 and
sorted into GFP-positive and GFP-negative groups via flow cytometry
prior to use. The in vitro limiting dilution assay was performed,
as previously described, using the extreme limiting dilution algorithm.
In short, cells were plated at a density of 1, 5, 10, and 20 cells
per well in a 96-well plate and spheres were scored 10–14 days
after plating.
