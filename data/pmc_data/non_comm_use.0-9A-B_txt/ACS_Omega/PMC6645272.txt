The
addition of polyethylenimine (PEI) in the standard chemical
bath deposition (CBD) of ZnO nanowires has received an increasing
interest for monitoring their aspect ratio, but the physicochemical
processes at work are still under debate. To address this issue, the
effects of PEI are disentangled from the effects of ammonia and investigated
over a broad range of molecular weight (i.e., chain length) and concentration,
varying from 1300 to 750 000 and from 1.5 to 10 mM, respectively.
It is shown that the addition of PEI strongly favors the elongation
of ZnO nanowires by suppressing the homogeneous growth at the benefit
of the heterogeneous growth as well as by changing the supersaturation
level through a pH modification. PEI is further found to inhibit the
development of the sidewalls of ZnO nanowires by adsorbing on their
nonpolar m-planes, as supported by Raman scattering
analysis. The inhibition proceeds even in the low pH range, which
somehow rules out the present involvement of electrostatic interactions
as the dominant mechanism for the adsorption. Furthermore, it is revealed
that PEI drastically affects the nucleation process of ZnO nanowires
on the polycrystalline ZnO seed layer by presumably adsorbing on the
nanoparticles oriented with the m-planes parallel
to the surface, reducing in turn their nucleation rate as well as
inducing a significant vertical misalignment. These findings, specifically
showing the effects of the PEI molecular weight and concentration,
cast light onto its multiple roles in the CBD of ZnO nanowires.

Introduction
As a surface-scalable,
low-cost, and low-temperature deposition
technique,1 chemical bath deposition (CBD)
offers a powerful route to form ZnO nanowires (NWs) with high structural
quality for their integration into a large number of nanoscale engineering
devices.2 To improve the performances of
the present devices, it is typically required to thoroughly control
the density and vertical alignment of ZnO NWs as well as their dimensions
(i.e., length, diameter, and aspect ratio)2 when homoepitaxially grown on a polycrystalline ZnO seed layer.3 The selective area growth approach using advanced
lithography and etching in a cleanroom environment has a high potential,4,5 but its complexity and cost are not compatible with all the targeted
technologies. Alternatively, following the spontaneous growth approach,
the density and vertical alignment of ZnO NWs are basically governed
by the respective density and mosaicity of the c-axis-oriented
ZnO nanoparticles composing the polycrystalline ZnO seed layer.3,6,7 More recently, Cossuet et al.
also revealed that some of the ZnO NWs with a vertical misalignment
form on semipolar ZnO nanoparticles.8 In
contrast, the dimensions of ZnO NWs are specifically driven by the
chemicals in aqueous solution, including a zinc salt (e.g., zinc nitrate,
zinc acetate, etc.) and a source of hydroxide ions [e.g., ethanol
amine, hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), NaOH, etc.].2,9 The
heterogeneous formation of ZnO NWs proceeds according to the following
main chemical reaction:10 Zn2+ + 2 HO– → ZnO(s) + H2O. To monitor
the aspect ratio of ZnO NWs to a higher degree of precision, the introduction
of chemical additives in aqueous solution acting as capping agents
is of high interest. Polyethylenimine (PEI)11−13 and diamines
like ethylenediamine14,15 adsorb on the nonpolar m-plane sidewalls of ZnO NWs to promote their axial elongation
at the expense of the radial growth. In contrast, chlorine ions16 and citrate ions17,18 adsorb on
the polar c-plane top facet of ZnO NWs to inhibit
the axial elongation at the benefit of the radial growth. Joo et al.
also reported the competitive and face-selective adsorption of non-zinc
metal cations at a high pH to monitor the shape of ZnO nanostructures
from platelets to needles.19 The present
approach is highly dependent upon the pH via the involvement of specific
electrostatic interactions20 and further
results in the doping of ZnO NWs following a thermal activation by
annealing.21

In that context, the
use of PEI has been reported to grow ZnO NWs
with a large length as required for enhancing the performances of
many devices including dye-sensitized solar cells.11−13 PEI exists
in either a linear or a branched form, and its properties are strongly
dependent upon that nature.22−27 PEI in its more usual branched form is a nonpolar polymer consisting
of an organic chain with the intercalations of N atoms and the ramifications
of side amino groups (−NH2).2 It is positively charged over a broad range of pH, following the
protonation of its side amino groups. The protonation rate is dependent
upon the pH, reducing from 1 down to 0 in the pH range of 3–11.26,27

It has been suggested that the adsorption of PEI on the sidewalls
of ZnO NWs proceeds through the favorable electrostatic interactions
between its protonated −NH2 side groups and the
negatively charged m-planes at a high pH above its
isoelectric point (IEP) around 10.5,28 but
the present mechanism is still under debate. PEI has typically been
used as the only chemical additive11,12,28−34 or with the combination of ammonia.13,34−40 Ammonia is often introduced in aqueous solution to increase the
pH above 10.5 and to complete the action of PEI by further reducing
the homogeneous nucleation.34−40 The role of ammonia is expected to complement the role of PEI to
reach an even higher aspect ratio. However, at that high pH, the protonation
rate is below 0.1, which directly questions the mechanisms at work
for the adsorption of PEI.26,27 The effects of PEI
are thus much less pronounced at that high pH, and it is not straightforward
to distinguish them from the effects of ammonia. Investigating the
CBD of ZnO NWs with no ammonia, and thus at a lower pH, would enable
to gain some crucial insights into the adsorption mechanisms at work.

The amount of PEI added in aqueous solution and the related pH
are also expected to strongly affect the morphology of ZnO NWs. However,
no comprehensive investigation stating the effects of the PEI concentration
over a broad range or any study measuring the pH in an in situ manner
have been reported. It has been shown that a relatively low concentration
of PEI is able to strongly increase the aspect ratio of ZnO NWs,12,30,31 owing to its presumable coordination
with Zn(II) ions35,41,42 limiting the homogeneous nucleation in aqueous solution at the benefit
of the heterogeneous nucleation on the polycrystalline ZnO seed layer.
This is also favorable to retain a relatively low pH to obtain a high
protonation rate, but the potential electrostatic interactions are
not favorable here as the m-planes are positively
charged.

Furthermore, the effects of the molecular weight (Mw) of PEI, especially through its chain length,
on the
morphology of ZnO NWs, have never been investigated deeply, although
it is expected to play a significant role. The use of PEI with the Mw of 800,13,37,40 4000,28 4500,34,35 25 000,40 70 000,29 and 750 00032 has been reported, whereas many other reports did not notify it.11,12,30,31,33,36,38,39 The only investigation
was achieved with the Mw of 800 and 25 000
using also ammonia, which somehow superimposes its effects and hence
limits its impact on that specific aspect.40 Investigating the CBD of ZnO NWs with the addition of PEI over a
broad range of Mw would enable to understand
in more detail its roles in aqueous solution.

In this paper,
we disentangle the effects of PEI on the CBD of
ZnO NWs using zinc nitrate and HMTA by introducing a varying concentration
of PEI in the range of 1.5–10 mM and by measuring the pH in
an in situ manner. The effects of the Mw (i.e., chain length) of PEI on the morphology of ZnO NWs are further
investigated in detail to get a deeper insight into the physicochemical
processes at work.

Results
The structural morphology
of ZnO NWs grown by CBD using the addition
of PEI with the given Mw of 1300, 25 000,
and 750 000 in a broad concentration range from 1.5 to 10 mM
is shown by the cross-sectional view and top-view field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) images in Figures 1, S1, and S2.
It is clearly revealed that the morphology of ZnO NWs is strongly
dependent upon the PEI concentration and Mw. The corresponding mean length, diameter, related aspect ratio,
and deposited volume are presented in Figure 2 from the FESEM image analysis over a population
of more than 200 ZnO NWs.

of 0–10 mM and for a given Mw of
1300. The scale bars represent 1 μm.

and (d) deposited volume of ZnO NWs grown by CBD as a function of
the PEI concentration and for the given Mw of 1300, 25 000, and 750 000.

Effects of PEI on the Length and Deposited Volume of ZnO NWs
The evolutions of the length and deposited volume of ZnO NWs as
a function of the PEI concentration for the given Mw of 1300, 25 000, and 750 000 are presented
in Figure 2a,d. The
length of ZnO NWs drastically increases from 780 ± 100 to about
1500 ± 100 nm in the low PEI concentration range and then decreases
progressively, regardless of the Mw. Interestingly,
the largest length is achieved for an optimal low PEI concentration,
for which the value increases from 0.75 to 3 mM as the PEI Mw is decreased from 750 000 to 1300.

To account for the variation of the length of ZnO NWs, in situ pH
measurements as a function of time are presented in Figure 3 for all the PEI concentrations
and Mw. During the first 20 min, the pH
is significantly reduced, as typically reported in refs (9, 20, 21). As the
temperature of 60 °C is reached, HO– ions are
progressively released in aqueous solution, following the gradual
hydrolysis of HMTA as a source of HO– ions. This
most likely accounts for the pH saturation after 20 min, which is
further more pronounced as the PEI concentration is increased, regardless
of its Mw. The growth temperature of 90
°C is reached after 40 min, which corresponds to the pH stabilization.
The slight increase in the pH associated with the highest PEI concentration
is likely due to the large consumption of Zn(II) ions acting as the
limiting reactant species.9 In the present
configuration with a large c-plane surface over the
total surface ratio, the elongation of ZnO NWs is limited by the mass
transport of the reactants and not by the surface reaction rate.43,44 The diffusive transport of Zn(II) ions acting as the limiting reactant
in aqueous solution may somehow be hampered by the protonated PEI
through repulsive electrostatic interactions, and its magnitude may
depend on the PEI concentration and Mw.

Figure 3 Evolution of the pH during the growth as a function of time for
the different PEI concentrations and for the given Mw of (a) 1300, (b) 25 000, and (c) 750 000.

More importantly, the pH is significantly
higher as the PEI concentration
is increased from 1.5 to 10 mM, owing to the number of side amino
groups, regardless of its Mw. The increase
in the length of ZnO NWs in the low PEI concentration range is certainly
related to the drastic decrease in the homogeneous nucleation in aqueous
solution at the benefit of the heterogeneous nucleation, which originates
from the presumable coordination of PEI with the Zn(II) ions. In contrast
to the only case of HMTA in ref (9), the growth of ZnO NWs is here almost exclusively driven
by the heterogeneous nucleation. As the PEI concentration is further
increased, it is expected that the solubility is increased, by analogy
with the thermodynamic simulations in ref (20), considering the addition of ammonia with a
different volume. This may in turn decrease the supersaturation, progressively
reducing the length of ZnO NWs. The evolution of the length of ZnO
NWs and, correlatively, of its volume as a function of the PEI concentration
and of its Mw is thus governed mainly
by the presumable formation of PEI–Zn(II) ion complexes suppressing
the homogeneous nucleation and by the different supersaturation levels
depending on the pH.

Effects of PEI on the Diameter of ZnO NWs
The evolution
of the diameter of ZnO NWs as a function of the PEI concentration
for the given Mw of 1300, 25 000,
and 750 000 is presented in Figure 2b. As the PEI concentration is increased
from 0 to 3 mM, the diameter of ZnO NWs drastically decreases from
70 ± 3 to about 50 nm, regardless of the Mw. The present decrease in the diameter of ZnO NWs correlated
with the concomitant drastic increase in their length results in a
significant increase in their aspect ratio, as presented in Figure 2c. This unambiguously
indicates that PEI inhibits the development of the sidewalls of ZnO
NWs and thus limits their radial growth, even in the present low pH
range. The decrease in the diameter is much less pronounced as the
PEI concentration is further increased from 3 to 10 mM, and the diameter
eventually saturates down to 42 ± 3, 45 ± 3, and 53 ±
3 nm for the given Mw of 1300, 25 000,
and 750 000, respectively. A further increase in the aspect
ratio can be achieved by prolonging the growth time, increasing the
solution volume in the sealed beaker, or varying the concentration
ratio between zinc nitrate and HMTA.

The Raman spectra of the
as-grown and annealed ZnO NWs at 300 °C for 30 min under nitrogen
atmosphere are presented in Figure 4. On both Raman spectra, the lines pointing at 1295
(2TO + TA), 1373 (2TO + TA), 1450 (3TO), 1553 (3TO), and 1600 cm–1 (3TO) are assigned to the modes of the silicon substrate.45 The Raman line at 1145 cm–1 is assigned to a ZnO second-order mode.46 Interestingly, a vast number of Raman lines attributed to the antisymmetric
and symmetric stretching modes of the C–Hx groups occurs in the range of 2800–3000 cm–1, specifically pointing at 2880, 2907, 2936, and 2974 cm–1.47 These modes were previously associated
with the presence of residual HMTA molecules, following their adsorption
on the sidewalls of ZnO NWs.9 In contrast,
they are also very likely here the signature of residual PEI molecules,
following their adsorption on the sidewalls of ZnO NWs. Correlatively,
an additional Raman line around 3070 cm–1 is attributed
to the stretching N–H modes.48,49 This is also
related to the residual PEI molecules, as the present line is typically
not reported on the Raman spectra of HMTA.9 Its intensity further increases after annealing under nitrogen atmosphere
at 300 °C for 1 h. It should further be noted that the C–N–C,
C–H, and C–H2 modes in the range of 1000–1500
cm–1 may occur, but the related Raman lines cannot
be distinguished owing to the presence of the silicon and ZnO modes
in the same range of wavenumbers. Eventually, two broad Raman lines
arise at 3388 and 3570 cm–1. The more intense Raman
line at 3570 cm–1 is related to interstitial hydrogen
in bond-centered sites (HBC).50,51 The less intense Raman line at 3388 cm–1 is expected
to involve a larger number of contributions, originating from the
O–H bonds on the surface of ZnO NWs,48,50 as well as from the hydrogen-related species such as defect complexes
involving multiple O–H bonds in a zinc vacancy in the form
of (VZn-Hn), where n lies in
the range of 2–4.50,52,53 As discussed in ref (54), the intensity of the present two broad Raman lines is strongly
decreased as the annealing temperature is raised to 300 °C and
ends up vanishing at 500 °C. In the present case involving the
addition of PEI, it is also likely that stretching N–H modes
occur in the present Raman line, as shown in ref (55) reporting the adsorption
of NH3 on TiO2 nanoparticles. Overall, the present
Raman scattering analysis supports the adsorption of PEI on the sidewalls
of ZnO NWs, mainly through the presence of C–Hx and N–H modes.

and annealed ZnO NWs at 300 °C for
30 min under nitrogen atmosphere using the PEI concentration and Mw of 3 mM and 1300, respectively.

Effects of PEI on the Apparent Density of
ZnO NWs
The
evolution of the apparent density of ZnO NWs as a function of the
PEI concentration for the given Mw of
1300, 25 000, and 750 000 is presented in Figure 5. Whatever the PEI concentration,
the apparent density of ZnO NWs is much smaller than the density of
the c-axis-oriented ZnO nanoparticles, which is typically
larger than 100 μm–2, as deduced from the
FESEM image analysis and X-ray diffraction measurements following
the procedure described in ref (9). As the PEI concentration is increased from 0 to 1.5 mM,
the apparent density of ZnO NWs is significantly decreased from 62
± 3 to 57 ± 3, 51 ± 3, and 33 ± 3 μm–2 for the given Mw of 750 000,
25 000, and 1300, respectively. The present decrease in the
apparent density of ZnO NWs is not related to the variation of the
magnitude of coalescence process given that the length of ZnO NWs
is concomitantly increased strongly while their diameter is progressively
decreased. Instead, it is expected that PEI affects the nucleation
process of ZnO NWs on the ZnO seed layer by presumably adsorbing on
the ZnO nanoparticles oriented with the nonpolar m-planes parallel to the surface. The present adsorption may reduce
the nucleation rate of ZnO NWs on ZnO nanoparticles with the semipolar
or polar c-planes parallel to the surface acting
as nucleation sites by steric hindrance. Also, the verticality of
ZnO NWs was assessed by X-ray pole figures recorded on the (0002)
diffraction peak by measuring the corresponding full width at half-maximum
(fwhm), as presented in Figure 6. The ZnO NWs grown with no PEI have a typical mean tilt angle
of 5–10°. The addition of PEI is associated with a systematic
vertical misalignment of ZnO NWs, which exhibit a larger mean tilt
angle lying in the range of 10–25°. This may be an additional
indication for the effect of PEI on the nucleation process. Moreover,
the magnitude of the present process may also be affected by the Mw. As the PEI concentration is further increased
from 3 to 10 mM, the apparent density continuously increased to 56
± 3, 69 ± 3, and 70 ± 3 μm–2 for the given Mw of 1300, 25 000,
and 750 000, respectively. This increase is, to some extent,
related to the decrease in the length and diameter of ZnO NWs, reducing
in turn the magnitude of the coalescence process. This arises mainly
from the vertical misalignment of ZnO NWs, resulting in an apparent
density depending on the height at which it is measured.

the apparent density of ZnO NWs grown by CBD as a
function of the PEI concentration and for the given Mw of 1300, 25 000, and 750 000.

diffraction

Discussion
The
different roles of PEI as well as the effects of its Mw (i.e., chain length) are summarized in Figure 7. The addition of
PEI has a strong influence on the growth regime, suppressing the homogeneous
growth in aqueous solution via the presumable formation of PEI–Zn(II)
ion complexes at the benefit of the heterogeneous growth of ZnO NWs
on the polycrystalline ZnO seed layer. This is favorable for the elongation
of ZnO NWs, and hence their length drastically increases with the
addition of PEI and as its concentration is slightly increased. Further,
the addition of PEI modifies the pH, directly affecting the supersaturation
level in aqueous solution. As the PEI concentration is further increased,
the supersaturation level basically decreases, further reducing the
length of ZnO NWs. It is also very likely that the presence of protonated
PEI with a positive charge affects the diffusive transport of Zn(II)
ions by repulsive electrostatic interactions. The addition of PEI
also inhibits the development of the sidewalls of ZnO NWs, reducing
the radial growth and their related diameters. PEI is thus expected
to adsorb on the nonpolar m-plane sidewalls of ZnO
NWs, even at the low pH range investigated here. The adsorption process
of PEI is still under debate; however, electrostatic interactions
are ruled out in the present investigation, in which a large part
of PEI is protonated and thus positively charged in the low pH range,
while the m-plane sidewalls are positively charged
as well below the IEP. Alternative adsorption mechanisms involving
the formation of covalent and hydrogen bonding with atoms and/or defects
at the surface for instance may proceed. Eventually, PEI clearly affects
the nucleation process of ZnO NWs by presumably adsorbing on the ZnO
nanoparticles oriented with the nonpolar m-planes
parallel to the surface, reducing in turn their nucleation rate and
inducing a strong vertical misalignment. Owing to their pronounced
chain length, steric hindrance may occur and directly disturb the
nucleation process of ZnO NWs.

roles of PEI and the effects
of its Mw (i.e., chain length) on the
nucleation and growth of ZnO NWs by CBD.

Conclusions
In summary, the multiple roles of PEI in the
growth of ZnO NWs
by CBD have thoroughly been investigated by disentangling their effects
from the effects of ammonia and by simultaneously varying its Mw and concentration over a broad range of 1300–750 000
and of 1.5–10 mM, respectively. It is shown that the addition
of PEI significantly increases the aspect ratio of ZnO NWs by favoring
their elongation along the polar c-axis and by inhibiting
the development of their sidewalls. As the PEI concentration is increased,
the aspect ratio of ZnO NWs is initially increased significantly and
then saturates or decreased, depending on its Mw. The length of ZnO NWs is basically improved initially by
suppressing the homogeneous growth at the benefit of the heterogeneous
growth via the presumable formation of PEI–Zn(II) ion complexes.
It is then decreased by the change of the supersaturation level through
the pH modification that is dependent upon the PEI Mw and concentration. Correlatively, the inhibition of
the development of the sidewalls of ZnO NWs is achieved by the PEI
adsorption on their nonpolar m-planes, as further
supported by the Raman scattering analysis showing the occurrence
of modes attributed to the C–Hx and N–H groups. The adsorption operates even in the present
low pH range, which somehow rules out the present involvement of electrostatic
interactions as the dominant mechanism. Importantly, the addition
of PEI drastically affects the density of ZnO NWs and hence their
nucleation process on the polycrystalline ZnO seed layer by presumably
adsorbing on the nanoparticles oriented with the m-planes parallel to the surface. The present adsorption typically
reduces the nucleation rate of ZnO NWs and induces a strong vertical
misalignment, presumably via steric hindrance, whereas its magnitude
highly depends on the PEI Mw. These findings
reveal the multiple roles of PEI in the growth of ZnO NWs by CBD,
which are essential for the improvement of the overall performances
of the related nanoscale engineering devices.

Experimental Section
The 30 nm thick polycrystalline ZnO seed layers were deposited
by the sol–gel process using dip coating on top of the (0001)
Si wafer cleaned by an ultrasonic bath with acetone and isopropanol.
The solution of chemical precursors was composed of 375 mM of zinc
acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) mixed with 375 mM of monoethanolamine in pure ethanol. It was
stirred on a hot plate kept at 60 °C for a couple of hours and
then at room temperature for 24 h. The samples were slowly dipped
and gently pulled out at a withdrawal speed of 3.3 mm/s under controlled
atmosphere with a hygrometry lower than 15%. They were further annealed
on a hot plate kept at 300 °C for 10 min for evaporating the
residual organic compounds and then at 500 °C for 1 h for crystallization.
The growth of ZnO NW arrays was performed by CBD using an aqueous
solution containing 25 mM of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and 25 mM of HMTA. The samples
were put horizontally face down in a sealed beaker within a regular
oven kept at 90 °C for 3 h. The solution temperature was thus
raised progressively to 90 °C within 40 min. PEI in its branched
form and with the Mw of 1300, 25 000,
and 750 000 was added, with the concentration ranging from
1.5 to 10 mM. These Mw values correspond
to the so-called short, medium, and long chains, respectively, roughly
varying from a few micrometers to more than 1 mm through several tens
of micrometers.

The in situ pH measurements were performed during
the CBD of ZnO
NWs using the InLab Versatile Pro pH electrode from Mettler Toledo,
whereas the temperature was recorded with a temperature probe combined
with the present pH electrode. The top-view and cross-sectional FESEM
images were recorded with an FEI Quanta 250 field emission gun scanning
electron microscope to investigate the morphological properties of
ZnO NWs (i.e., vertical alignment, typical dimensions like length
and diameter, and density). Raman scattering was performed with a
Jobin Yvon/HORIBA Labram spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled
charge-coupled device detector. The 488 nm excitation line of an Ar+
laser was used, and the power at the sample surface was close to 3.75
mW. The light was focused on a spot size smaller than 1 μm2 using a 50 times long working distance objective. The Raman
spectra were calibrated using a silicon reference sample at room temperature
with a theoretical position of 520.7 cm–1. The X-ray
pole figures were obtained with a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using
Cu Kα1 radiation.
The apparatus was equipped with a four-circle goniometer (i.e. ω,
2θ, φ, and χ), 2.5° Sollers slits, as well
as a graphite monochromator and a scintillation detector. The complete
X-ray pole figure patterns were first recorded on the (0002) diffraction
peak and the second rebuilt for a chi angle in the range of −90
to +90°. For positive and negative chi angles, the intensity
was obtained by integrating the corresponding intensity for the phi
angle in the range of 0–180° and 180–360°,
respectively. Half of fwhm represents a quantitative measurement of
the mean tilt angle of ZnO NWs.
