Au
nanoparticles supported on alumina (Au/Al2O3) with average particle size of 3.9 ± 0.7 nm and surface plasmon
band centerned at 516.5 nm were prepared by deposition–precipitation
method, and their photocatalytic activities for the reduction of nitrobenzene
using either formic acid in acetonitrile (method A) or KOH in 2-propanol
(method B) were investigated. Even at room temperature, the Au/Al2O3 was found to be highly active and selective
for conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline when used with formic acid
in acetonitrile or to azobenzene when performed with KOH in 2-propanol
under irradiation with green light-emitting diode (517 nm).

Introduction
Since Haruta et al.
reported their pioneering work on Au catalysts
for the oxidation of carbon monoxide in 1987,1 research on Au nanoparticles has grown exponentially. The developments
of Au nanoparticles including their preparation, characterization,
theoretical interpretation, and utilization have produced numerous
breakthrough discoveries that will serve as fundamentals for future
innovations.2−14 Au nanoparticles possess surface plasmon resonance (SPR) property
in which their electrons oscillate in harmony with the irradiating
light. This unique behavior, only found in a few metals such as Au,
Ag, Cu, and Pt has been employed for many applications15 including surface-enhanced Raman scattering,16 spectroscopy,17 biosensor,18 and photocatalysis.19,20 The SP band is generally in the visible light region, hence, allowing
the utilization of sunlight as a clean and sustainable source of energy.
Despite having been exploited for various fields for a long time,
SPR-mediated catalysis of organic reactions has just been picking
up steam in the last few years and a number of researches have sprung
up as illustrated in various reviews.21−27

Reduction of aromatic nitro compounds is important because
it can
provide many products including aromatic amines and azo dyes, which
are essential for the pharmaceutical, pigment, and agrochemical industries.28 Industrially, aniline is produced by catalytic
hydrogenation of nitrobenzene using Cu, Pd, and Fe as a catalyst or
amination of phenol using ammonia in the presence of a silica–alumina
catalyst,28 while the production of azo
dyes includes diazotization and coupling, condensation of nitro compounds
with amines, reduction of nitro compounds, and oxidation of amino
compounds.29 When nitrobenzene is reduced,
aniline is the final product, while intermediates that include nitrosobenzene, N-phenylhydroxylamine, azoxybenzene, azobenzene, and hydrazobenzene
could also be obtained depending on the reaction conditions. Several
methods for reduction of nitroarenes have been reported as reviewed
by Kadam and Tilve.30 Some examples of
photocatalysts are Au/ZrO2,31 Au/TiO2,32 Au/CeO2,33 Au–Cu alloy,34 Au/TiO2 photocatalyst with an Ag co-catalyst,35 Pt-deposited amino-functionalized Ti(IV) metal–organic
framework (Pt/Ti-MOF-NH2),36 CdS/g-C3N4,37 uniform
CdS nanospheres/graphene hybrid nanocomposites,38 Ce2S3,39 CdS nanowires,40 and PbBiO2X (X = Cl, Br).41

The majority of
researches of nitroarenes reduction has been using
hydrogen gas, borohydride, and ammonium formate as a hydrogen donor.
Recently, formic acid (FA, HCO2H) has also been demonstrated
to be used as a hydrogen source for the reduction of nitrobenzene.42−44 Formic acid, industrially manufactured by methyl formate hydrolysis
and hydrolysis of formamide, is inexpensive, easily handled, and abundantly
available with nearly a million tons produced worldwide each year.45 A number of researches have also been focusing
on producing FA sustainably from biomass.46−50 These make FA another ideal source of hydrogen.

In this study, gold nanoparticles supported on γ-Al2O3 (Au/Al2O3) were prepared, characterized,
and explored for their photocatalytic activity under light-emitting
diode (LED) irradiation at room temperature for the reductions of
nitrobenzene using either FA in acetonitrile or KOH in 2-propanol.

Results
and Discussion
Au/Al2O3 was prepared
by deposition–precipitation
method.51 The prepared gold nanoparticles,
slightly purple in color, had an average particle size, measured by
transmission electron microscopy, of 3.9 ± 0.7 nm (Figure S1, Supporting Information (SI)). The
actual gold content, determined by inductively coupled plasma analysis,
was 1.85% w/w. The supported Au nanoparticles showed a broad surface
plasmon band centered at 516.5 nm typical for Au nanoparticles (Figure 1).3 a X-ray diffraction spectra
of both the supporting materials and the prepared Au nanoparticles
were measured (Figure S2, SI), but no obvious
peaks of Au were found. The X-ray photoelectron spectrum of Au/Al2O3 showed binding energy of Au 4f7/2 of Au(0) at 83.8 eV and of Au 4f5/2 at 87.5 eV (Figure S3, SI). These doublet Au 4f peaks are
similar to those of gold foil31,52 indicating that Au(III)
used to prepare the gold nanoparticles was reduced to Au(0).53−55

and the intensity spectrum of green LED used for photocatalysis.

The Au/Al2O3 was used for the reduction of
nitrobenzene in two methods, using FA in acetonitrile (method A) or
KOH in 2-propanol (method B) as shown in Scheme 1. Each of this method was also performed
both under green LED (the spectrum of the green LED emitter is shown
in Figure 1 by green
line and the LED reactor is shown in Figure S4 in SI) and dark condition to ascertain the enhancement of the reaction
by SPR.

Scheme 1 Two Methods of Nitrobenzene Reduction
For method A, as shown in Figure 2, using 1 mmol nitrobenzene, 3.5 mmol FA,b and 100 mg Au/Al2O3 at 23
°C,
the reaction in dark condition was much slower and only about 60%
of aniline was produced after 56 h while under LED irradiation 96%
of aniline was obtained at the same time. Nitrosobenzene as an intermediate
gradually increased in both condition and began to decrease after
about 36 h under LED irradiation. The reaction without the Au/Al2O3 gave no product at all. Using only Al2O3 also gave no product even under the irradiation. The
reaction in acetic acid or propionic acid also gave no product. Corma
et al. reported two-step reaction to produce azobenzene from nitrobenzene
using Au/TiO2.56 The second
step was oxidation of aniline. However, the present Au/Al2O3 was inactive for oxidation of aniline under oxygen
atmosphere.

Figure 2 Time courses of the reduction of nitrobenzene using Au/Al2O3 and formic acid in acetonitrile under LED irradiation
and dark condition. Reaction conditions: 1 mmol nitrobenzene, 3.5
mmol FA, 100 mg Au/Al2O3, 40 mL acetonitrile,
23 °C. The amount of each compound was determined by gas chromatography
(GC) (see SI for an example of the chromatogram, Figure S5) using naphthalene as an internal standard.

Next, the Au/Al2O3 was later used for reduction
of nitrobenzene using KOH in 2-propanol as in method B. Time courses
also revealed a significant enhancement by LED irradiation throughout
the reaction (Figure 3). The reaction of nitrobenzene into azobenzene under LED irradiation
completed in about 11 h while only 10% of azobenzene and 41% of azoxybenzene
was produced under the dark condition. The amount of azoxybenzene
intermediate rose much faster than that of azobenzene for both conditions
and began to decrease after 5 h under LED irradiation.

Figure 3 Time courses of the reduction
of nitrobenzene using Au/Al2O3 and KOH in 2-propanol.
Reaction conditions: 1 mmol
nitrobenzene, 3 mL 0.1 M KOH in 2-propanol, 50 mg Au/Al2O3, 37 mL 2-propanol, 23 °C. The amount of each compound
was determined by GC using naphthalene as an internal standard. Note
that small amounts of nitrosobenzene intermediate (up to 3%) and aniline
byproduct (up to 2%) are not shown.

In both methods, the Au/Al2O3 can selectively
reduce nitrobenzene to the target products, which are significantly
enhanced by the irradiation from green LED. In addition, using only
one catalyst, two reactions were successfully and selectively performed
to obtain the desired products by changing hydrogen source and reaction
conditions.

After excitation by light, Au nanoparticles can
cause cascading
changes in nearby particles through four possible pathways including
plasmonic heating, hole transfer, electron transfer, and antenna effects.25,57,58 Several factors could affect
the activation efficiency of Au nanoparticles including but not limited
to particle size, particle shape, dispersion of particles, amount
of Au deposited on the supporting materials, and their supporting
materials.59,60 The reported band gap of γ-Al2O3 is 8.7 eV.61 However,
after Au nanoparticles were deposited on its surface, its band gap
was reduced to 2.4 eV,62 making its band
gap in the semiconductor range and, therefore, their electrons can
be activated from their valence band to conduction band by light with
matched wavelength. The excited electrons, also referred to as hot
electrons,34 and holes can initiate the
organic transformation, in which reduction occurs at the surface of
Au nanoparticles while oxidation occurs at the supporting materials.
The gap between the calculated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) of nitrobenzene (−2.91 eV) and the Fermi energy level
of Au (−5.1 eV) is about 2.2 eV (Figure 4).34 The energy
of maximum absorption of the prepared Au/Al2O3 is about 2.4 eV. Therefore, the energy absorbed by the Au/Al2O3 would be sufficient to generate hot electrons
that will subsequently transfer to LUMO of nitrobenzene adsorbed on
the Au surface, breaking the N–O bond and starting the reaction.

Figure 4 Hot electron
transfer from Au nanoparticles to LUMO of nitrobenzene
(modified from Xiao et al. (34)).

The mechanism for the
electrochemical reduction of nitrobenzene
was proposed in 1898 (Scheme S1, SI).63 Corma et al. also reported that two routes are
possible for the reduction of nitrobenzene to N-phenylhydroxylamine
and the route skipping nitrosobenzene is a faster step since they
could not detect nitrosobenzene during the reaction.64 In our case, however, nitrosobenzene was detected in significant
amount during the reduction using the Au/Al2O3 and FA and, therefore, the second step into N-phenylhydroxylamine
is the rate determining step (Scheme S2, SI). Based on this information, the overall mechanism for the reduction
of nitrobenzene using Au/Al2O3 and FA has been
proposed (Scheme S3, SI). In general, hydrides
from FA molecules are abstracted by Au nanoparticles forming Au–H
species and releasing CO2 in steps 1, 3, and 5.65−67 In step 2, one of the oxygens from nitrobenzene then binds to these
hydrides and water and nitrosobenzene are produced. This nitrosobenzene
is then hydrogenated to become N-phenylhydroxylamine
in step 4. In the last step, one hydride binds to nitrogen while another
hydride binds to oxygen of N-phenylhydroxylamine
producing aniline and water. Overall, three molecules of FA are required
which is consistent with the results (Table S1, SI).

The mechanism of the reaction using KOH and 2-propanol
is also
proposed (Schemes S4–6, SI). With
large accumulation of azoxybenzene, the last step of the reaction
should be the rate determining step (Scheme S4, SI). KOH is believed to help in deprotonation of 2-propanol
to form the corresponding alkoxide binds to the Au nanoparticles.
Then β-hydride elimination produces acetone and Au–H
(Scheme S5, SI, and steps 1, 3, and 5 in Scheme S6). Once Au–H is formed the remaining
steps are similar to those of FA as follows. Oxygen from nitrobenzene
receives H from Au nanoparticles and nitrosobenzene and water are
formed in step 2. Hydrogenation of nitrosobenzene produces N-phenylhydroxylamine (step 4) which condenses with another
molecule of nitrosobenzene producing azoxybenzene (step 6).68 Finally, in step 7, oxygen of azoxybenzene receives
hydrogens, water, and azobenzene is produced.

Conclusions
In
summary, we found that Au nanoparticles supported on alumina
act as highly efficient and selective photocatalyst for the reductions
of nitrobenzene to aniline using widely available formic acid and
to azobenzene using KOH and 2-propanol, respectively. The Au/Al2O3 under the LED irradiation is capable of the
reactions at ambient temperatures which avoids generation of byproducts
or decompositions of the products or reagents at high temperature.

b The effect of FA on the reaction
was
investigated (Table S1, SI), and we found
that at least 3 equiv of FA were required. Note that when large excess
of FA was used at high temperature, for example, 80 °C, formanilide
was formed as the main product due to the reaction between FA and
formed aniline.
