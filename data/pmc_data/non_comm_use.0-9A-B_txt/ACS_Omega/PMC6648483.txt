CO2 emission is generally
regarded as the major contributor
to global climate change, and polyethylenimine (PEI)-based CO2 adsorbents are promising materials for the capture of low
concentration CO2. This paper deals with the deactivation
kinetics of PEI-based CO2 adsorbents used for the capture
of low concentration CO2. EA and TG analyses demonstrated
that thermal degradation and O2-induced deactivation of
the adsorbents occurred simultaneously under air exposure conditions.
It was found by N2 exposure experiments at the temperature
of 50–80 °C that the thermal degradation of PEI-based
adsorbents followed a first-order reaction model with an activation
energy of 80.98 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor of 6.055 ×
108 (h–1). The parallel reaction model
was employed to distinguish the O2-induced deactivation
from the thermal degradation of the adsorbents through air exposure
experiments within 50–80 °C. The O2-induced
deactivation exhibited a second-order reaction with an activation
energy of 74.47 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor of 6.321 ×
106 (%–1·h–1).
The results of simulating the overall deactivation of the adsorbents
by the parallel reaction kinetic model were well consistent with those
of the experiments, proving that the parallel reaction model was feasible
for the description of the deactivation of PEI-based adsorbents.

1 Introduction
CO2 emission
is generally regarded as the major contributor
to global climate change. Different approaches exploited for capturing
or separating CO2 include absorption into liquid solvents,1−3 permeation through membranes,4 and adsorption
on solids as well.5 Liquid absorption is
efficient for CO2 removal, but most often requires high
regeneration energy. The membrane separation process faces the challenge
of selectivity and the low permeation rates.6 The technology of adsorption has drawn particular attention because
of its high efficiency and lower energy consumption. The interest
in the use of amine-based adsorbents inspired by liquid amine solvent
technology has increased during the last few years.7,8 Amine-based
adsorbents capture CO2 by the chemical mechanism with the
virtues of high adsorption efficiency, easy regeneration, and tolerance
to water.9 Polymer amine-based adsorbents,
such as polyethylenimine (PEI), are achieving higher thermal stabilities
and a better adsorptive effect of CO2 compared to small
molecule amine adsorbents.10

Stability
or service life of the CO2 adsorbent is a
key index in the evaluation criterion of adsorbent properties.11 Physical conditions including adsorption/desorption
time, temperature, and pressure affect the stability of the adsorbents.
Moreover, chemical factors, especially the interactions between amine
and H2O,12 SO2,13 H2S,14 NOx,15 O2,16 and CO217 deactivate the amine-based adsorbents. In the
capture of low concentration CO2 such as direct air capture
(DAC) of CO2 from ambient air or closed cabins, H2O, O2, and CO2 are the likely ingredients that
deactivate adsorbents. The service life of CO2 amine-based
adsorbents is mainly determined by the stability of amines, which
could be concluded to four major factors:18 effective component loss subjected to physical effect, thermal degradation,
CO2-induced deactivation, and O2-induced deactivation.
Drage et al.19 observed a great loss in
CO2 adsorption capacity with concentrated CO2 as the regeneration purge gas at desorption temperatures of 110–140
°C, which attributed to the chemical reaction of CO2 with amines on PEI and the irreversible formation of urea at elevated
temperatures. Didas et al.20 evaluated the thermal instability of materials
with methyl amine functionality through the loss of organic content
at elevated temperatures. Calleja et al.21 found that nitrogen content decreased to a small extent for amine-functionalized
SBA-15 materials dried in air atmosphere at 110 °C, while the
materials showed a significant decrease in CO2 adsorption
capacity. Celedonio et al.18 validated
the lower stability of amine-based adsorbents under CO2/air than CO2/N2 conditions, indicating that
O2 accelerated the deactivation of the amine adsorbent.
Different groups22−24 have reported that primary and tertiary monoamines
kept stable during the long term adsorption/desorption cycles at different
temperatures while secondary monoamine was more liable to oxidative
degradation, and mixed amines were most sensitive. Based on the dominant
reactions between O2 and monoethanolamine (MEA), Percy
et al.25 constructed a dynamic mathematical
model from the first principles for the CO2 absorber column
to quantify the loss of MEA through oxidative degradation, demonstrating
that the concentrations of CO2, O2, and H2O affect the degradation rate of MEA. Svendsen et al.26 conducted the experimental studies on the oxidative
degradation of MEA and concluded that the temperature had a higher
impact on MEA loss than oxygen concentration. Deactivation kinetics
of amine has been studied in depth in association with CO2 absorption in amine solutions25,27 and the thermal stability
of PEI-based CO2 adsorbents had been explored at elevated
temperatures between 110 and 180 °C.19 However, few studies were reported on the deactivation kinetics
of solid amine adsorbents upon long term exposure to air, especially
for the adsorbent used in the DAC process that characterized with
low CO2 concentration and temperature. CO2 may
take part in the deactivation under high temperature and CO2 concentration, such as 100 °C with pure CO2.28 Considering the low concentration of CO2, it is reasonable to ignore the effect of CO2 on
the degradation of PEI-based adsorbents in this research. On the opposite,
the effect of O2 on the degradation of amine-based adsorbents
is much greater because the concentration of oxygen is 50–500
times that of carbon dioxide. Though the ignorance of the effect of
CO2 simplified the issue, a major problem rose from the
existence of a large amount of O2 was that the co-existence
of thermal degradation and O2-induced deactivation in the
system. Another problem was that the deactivation of the amine-based
adsorbent operated under mild conditions is a long term time-dependent
change. It had reported that little change in the properties of the
PEI-based CO2 adsorbent had been observed after 2000 adsorption/desorption
cycles under 20–30 °C.29 Surely,
it would be time and energy consuming if the study was conducted at
the working temperatures of the PEI-based adsorbent. The work was
an attempt to establish the kinetic model for the deactivation of
PEI-based adsorbents used at ambient temperature. A parallel reaction
model was employed in the work to resolve the thermal and O2-induced deactivations that occurred simultaneously. The deactivation
kinetics of the PEI-based adsorbent was then explored within a suitable
range of temperature so that the kinetic model could be extrapolated,
in a more practical and feasible way, to the temperature at which
the PEI-based adsorbent is operated.

The deactivation kinetic
of the PEI-based CO2 adsorbent
plays a significant role in determining the reaction mechanism, estimating
the influences of different operation conditions, and providing effective
methods to prevent the rapid deactivation of the adsorbents.30,31 Accurate kinetic models could be applied to evaluate adsorbent performance
and support the designs of reactors and processes. The model of the
deactivation kinetics established at reasonable temperatures is also
an approach for the prediction of the service life of the PEI-based
adsorbent used at 20–30 °C.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Experimental Temperature
TGA (TA
Instruments, SDT Q600) was employed to investigate the effect of temperature
on the stability of the PEI-based adsorbents. The weight loss curves
of the adsorbents and support, the porous polymer resin are presented
in Figure 1a and their
derivatives, in Figure 1b.

Figure 1 TGA (a) and derivative (b) curves of PEI-based adsorbents and the
support under N2 stream.

It could be seen from Figure 1 the support of the adsorbent started to decompose
around 200 °C, meaning the temperature of the deactivation study
should not be higher than 200 °C. Almost no signs of weight loss
are observed for both the support and PEI-based adsorbent below the
temperature of 100 °C, indicating the deactivation study can
be conducted below 100 °C in principle. However, the deactivation
mechanism of the PEI-based adsorbent may vary with temperatures. To
reduce as much as possible the likely bias caused by deviating from
the true deactivation mechanism, the experiment for kinetic studies
was conducted below 80 °C with the lowest temperature at 50 °C
to make sure of a reasonable deactivation speed.

2.2 O2-Induced Deactivation Reaction
On the
setup of Figure 8,
the deactivations of PEI-based adsorbents were performed
under different temperatures. The amino group losses measured by the
weighing method are presented in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Curves of adsorbent mass losses measured by
the weighing method
at different temperatures.

It shows from Figure 2 that the mass loss of adsorbents increases with exposure
time both
in N2 and simulated air atmospheres. Meaningfully, the
mass loss of adsorbents in N2 is generally greater than
that in simulated air at all the three temperatures.

It has
been reported that the weight change after oxidation treatment
did not appear to track the stability of the adsorbents for carbon
capture applications.23 The reason is mainly
due to the co-existence of thermal degradation and O2-induced
deactivation, and the latter is connected with oxygen addition and
weight gain. It is, thus, reasonable to speculate that some oxygen
addition reaction occurs when the PEI-based adsorbent is exposed to
simulated air. The speculation is supported by the literature observations
of the formation of urea and organic acids linkages at the expense
of amino groups.32

Evidence of the
oxygen addition reaction is also given by elemental
analysis (Elementar, Vario MICRO). The results of the elemental analysis
of PEI extracted from the adsorbents are presented in Table 1. It shows that 67 °C N2 exposure process results in higher contents of C, H, and
N than air exposure, and lower air exposure temperature, 67 °C,
results in higher contents of C, H, and N than higher temperature
(80 °C). Because few other elements except N, H, and C are introduced
into the system in the air exposure process, the declining of the
contents of C, H, and N in the adsorbent should be contributed by
the O-addition reaction.

80	simulated air	550	53.18	8.58	23.38	14.86	
The results above support that O-addition reaction
occurs with
thermal degradation when the adsorbent is exposed to simulated air.
It needs finding a way to distinguish the two reactions from each
other to establish a proper kinetic model of deactivation.

2.3 Data Collection
The weighing method
determines the amino group content for the process of single decomposition
of the PEI-based adsorbent, but is not applicable for the process
of air exposure deactivation because of the presence of O-addition,
which increases the weight of adsorbents by binding oxygen atoms.
On the other hand, CO2-adsorption method works for both
N2 and air exposure processes as it “titrates”
amino groups directly. However, the weighing method is not only convenient,
but also has better reproducibility than the CO2-adsorption
method, as long as the weighing method is applicable. Figure 3 presents the comparison of
the results of the two methods, showing that experimental datum points
by the weighing method result in even curves while those by the CO2-adsorption method are uneven. Thus, the weighing method is
favored whenever it is applicable in the study.

Figure 3 Amino group losses measured
by weighing and CO2-adsorption
methods.

Although the weighing method is
favored, some error of the weighing
method should not be ignored. Figure 3 shows that the in N2-exposure process,
the difference between the PEI losses measured by the two methods
is not very significant before 1000 h, but after 1000 h the bias increases
gradually with time. The systematic error of the weighing method is
introduced from the existence of a small amount of O2 in
the reaction system, which leads to significant O-addition when the
reaction time is long enough. For the air exposure process, the CO2-adsorption method is obviously more reliable because of the
existence of O-addition. Therefore, the data for kinetic studies are
collected on the setup of Figure 8 with both weighing and CO2-adsorption methods.
By applying the data to parallel-reaction mode, the thermal degradation,
and O2-induced deactivation processes are thus able to
be distinguished satisfactorily for the air exposure deactivation
of the PEI-based adsorbent.

2.4 Kinetics of Thermal Degradation
The
deactivation of the adsorbent under a nitrogen atmosphere is mainly
thermal degradation and thus O2-induced deactivation is
ignored because little oxygen exists in the reaction system. In this
case, the weight loss of adsorbents is contributed by PEI thermal
degradation and the degradation rate is determined with the data obtained
by the weighing method.

The foundation for the study of kinetic
data from the PEI loss curve is based on the basic rate equation 1  where k = the rate constant, 2  n = reaction order.

Substituting n = 0, 1, and 2 into eqs 1 and 2 gives 3  where t represents reaction
time, e, f, and g are constants.

The N2 exposure experiments of the
adsorbent at 67 and
74 °C are performed and the deactivation curves are presented
in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Deactivation
curves of N2 exposure experiments.

The values of thermal degradation rate constant kD under 67 and 74 °C for n = 0,
1, and 2 are listed in Table 2. Judged by the values of R2,
the coefficient of correlation, the thermal degradation of the adsorbent
is most likely of first-order (n = 1), namely 4   5

Substituting the thermal degradation rate constants
of 67 and 74
°C into the Arrhenius equation 6  where A is a pre-exponential
factor, Ea is activation energy, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), and T is the temperature in K. The activation energy (Ea) and the pre-exponential factor (A) of thermal degradation are 79.76 kJ/mol and 3.957 × 108 (h–1), respectively. Thus, the relationship
between reaction temperatures and thermal degradation rate constants, kD, is 7  

An experiment of N2 exposure of the PEI-based adsorbent
was conducted at 50 °C for the validation of the first-order
kinetic model. The curve of the thermal degradation via the weighing
method is shown in Figure 5. By eq 5, the
rate constant of the thermal degradation at 50 °C is calculated
as kD50°C = 4.916 × 10–5 (h–1) from the slope (R2 = 0.9959). Compared with kD50°C = 5.038 × 10–5 (h–1) calculated
by eq 7, the relative
error is about 2%. The simulation curve modeled by the 50 °C
thermal degradation with eq 5 is also shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that the first-order kinetic model
agreed with experimental data.

Figure 5 The comparison of 50 °C thermal degradation
and simulation
with the first-order kinetic model.

To improve the model’s reliability, the experiment
of 50
°C thermal degradation was introduced to determine the reaction
active energy. With k50°C, k67°C, and k74°C, the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor of the thermal
degradation are modified to 80.98 kJ/mol and 6.055 × 108 (h–1), respectively, on the basis of Arrhenius eq 6. The relationship between
reaction temperatures and thermal degradation rate constants is calibrated
as 8  

2.5 Kinetics of O2-Induced Deactivation
The deactivation data of the adsorbent exposed to simulated air
was obtained by the CO2-adsorption method. As thermal degradation
and O2-induced deactivation occurred simultaneously in
the air exposure process of the PEI-based adsorbent, the reaction
was then considered a parallel reaction shown as the following

kD of different temperatures
could be resolved by eq 8, while kO as well as the reaction order
of O2-induced deactivation are to be determined. According
to the general scheme for amine oxidation 9  the oxidation rate at a particular temperature
could be represented as 10  where kO is the
rate constant of O2-induced deactivation, PO2 is instantaneous O2 partial pressure
during adsorption, m and n are orders
of reaction with respect to O2 and amine, respectively.

There being little change in the air exposure process, PO2m is
taken as a constant and kOPO2m is lumped into
the rate constant, kO′, leading to 11  

The total rate of the loss of amino groups in the parallel reaction
is the sum of thermal degradation and O2-induced deactivation
rates 12  

Substitute eqs 4 and 11 into eq 12 gives 13  

Substituting the reaction
orders (n = 0, 1, 2)
of O-degradation into eq 13 and integrating gives 14-1   14-2   14-3  where p, q, and u are constants.

The air exposure experiments of the adsorbent at 60, 67, and 74
°C are performed and the deactivation curves are presented in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Deactivation curves of
amine-based adsorbent under air exposure.

The deactivation curves are fitted with eqs 14-1-14-2–14-3, and the resulting parameters are reported in Table 3. It is found that
the fitting of the second-order reaction, n = 2,
is the best in general by the values of R2. Thus, O2-induced deactivation rate, rO, and the content of the amino group in the adsorbent, cA, are expressed as 15   16  where w is constant.

Using the values of kO′ of 60,
67, and 74 °C reported
in Table 3, the activation
energy (72.99 kJ/mol) and the pre-exponential factor [3.751 ×
106 (%–1·h–1)]
of the pseudo second-order oxidative degradation are obtained based
on Arrhenius eq 6. The
relationship between reaction temperature T and rate
constant kO′ is then expressed as 17

An experiment of air exposure of the PEI-based adsorbent
was conducted
at 50 °C for the validation of the parallel reaction model. The
curve of the air exposure process obtained by the CO2-adsorption
method is shown in Figure 7. Substituting kD (50 °C)
calculated by eq 5 into eq 16 and plotting ekDt with kD/cA, kO′ (50 °C),
the rate constant of O2-induced deactivation at 50 °C,
is obtained as 5.733 × 10–6 (%–1·h–1) with a R2 of 0.9855 from the slope and intercept of the generated line. Compared
with kO′ (50 °C) = 5.960 × 10–6 (%–1·h–1) calculated by eq 15, the relative error
is about 4%. The simulation curve modeled by the 50 °C O2-induced deactivation with eq 16 is also shown in Figure 7. It can be seen from Figure 7 that the parallel reaction model consists
of first-order thermal degradation and second-order O2-induced
deactivation agrees well with the experimental data. The average of
absolute relative deviation of the simulation is 2.7% calculated by 18  where ŷi and yi are the predictive and experimental value, n is
the number of data points, and i represents the i-th data point. The validation confirmed that the parallel
reaction model is reliable in the description of the overall O2-induced deactivation of the PEI-based adsorbent.

Figure 7 The results
of 50 °C air exposure of the adsorbent and the
predictions by the parallel reaction model.

To make the parallel reaction model more reliable, the rate
constant
of O2-induced deactivation kO′ (50 °C)
= 5.733 × 10–6 (%–1·h–1) is introduced to determine the active energy. With kO′ (50 °C), kO′ (60 °C), kO′ (67 °C),
and kO′ (74 °C), the activation energy and the pre-exponential
factor of O2-induced deactivation are modified to 74.47
kJ/mol and 6.321 × 106 (%–1·h–1), respectively, on the basis of the Arrhenius equation.
The relationship between reaction temperatures and the rate constant
of O2-induced deactivation then becomes 19  

3 Conclusions
Studies of the N2 exposure of the adsorbent within 50–80
°C illustrated the thermal degradation of the PEI-based CO2 adsorbent, followed by a first-order reaction model with
an activation energy of 80.98 kJ/mol and pre-exponential factor of
6.055 × 108 (h–1). Under air exposure
condition, O2-induced deactivation and thermal degradation
of the adsorbent occurred simultaneously. Employing a parallel reaction
model into the reaction system, the O2-induced deactivation
was distinguished from the thermal degradation, and the O2-induced deactivation reaction of the adsorbent exhibited a second-order
reaction with an activation energy of 74.47 kJ/mol and pre-exponential
factor of 6.321 × 106 (%–1·h–1). The parallel-reaction kinetic model established
at elevated temperatures successfully predicted the overall deactivation
of the PEI-based adsorbent performed at 50 °C, proving it was
a feasible model to describe the deactivation of the adsorbent.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Preparation of the Adsorbent
Branched
PEI (Mw = 600, Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem
Technology Co., Ltd, China) dissolved in methanol (Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd, China) solution was impregnation liquor for porous
polyacrylamide microspheres (Knowledge & Benefit Sphere Tech.
Co., Ltd, China). Considering the CO2 uptake and the stability,
∼15 wt % PEI-loaded adsorbents were obtained by evaporating
the solvents.

The surface areas and pore structures of the adsorbents
were determined with a Quantachrome Autosorb-IQ2-MP apparatus and
the particle size distribution was evaluated on an LS-230 Coulter
Laser Granularity analyzer. The physical parameters of the adsorbent
were listed in Table 4.

4.2 Experimental Procedure
The deactivation
of PEI-based adsorbents was tested on the setup, as shown in Figure 8. The setup consists of mass flow controllers (D08-2F, Sevenstar
Electronics Co., Ltd, China), thermostat (1100-G1316A, Agilent Technologies
Co., Ltd., USA), and Φ16 × 100 mm stainless-steel tube
reactors (self-made) packed with ∼7 g of PEI-based adsorbent.
Adsorbents were pretreated in the reactor under 50 °C with 500
mL/min of nitrogen gas (99.99%, Hangzhou Jingong Specialty Gases Co.,
Ltd, China) for 24 h to remove small molecular components like H2O and CO2. The thermostat was then set to the required
temperatures under either simulated air (79% N2 + 21% O2, Hangzhou Jingong Specialty Gases Co., Ltd, China) or N2 for deactivation experiments.

Figure 8 Diagram of the setup
used for the deactivation of the PEI-based
adsorbent.

4.3 Methods
for the Determination of the Amino
Group
The amount of the remaining amino group of PEI on the
adsorbent was determined with weighing and CO2-adsorption
methods. The weighing method measured the loss of adsorbents and obtained
the weight loss curve of the adsorbent over time. Because the polymer
support is thermostable below its decomposition temperature, the weight
loss of the adsorbent was contributed by the deactivation of amino
groups. The CO2-adsorption method measured the change of
the CO2 adsorption capacities before and after the deactivation
was performed on the setup, as shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Diagram of the setup of the CO2-adsorption
method.

The setup consisted of mass flow
controllers (D08-2F, Sevenstar
Electronics Co., Ltd, China), thermostat (AT-950, Automatic Science
Instrument Co., Ltd., China), IR gas analyzer (GXH-510, Xibi Instrument
Co. Ltd., China), and Φ16 × 100 mm stainless-steel tube
reactor (self-made). In the system, the CO2 concentration
of the outlet of the tube reactor was monitored by an IR gas analyzer.

The presence of amino groups on the adsorbent clearly determined
the content of CO2 adsorption21 and the loss of CO2 adsorption capacity was primarily
due to the degradation of amino groups. The amino groups of PEI-based
adsorbents, therefore, were determined by the CO2-adsorption
method according to the following reaction: 20  

The CO2 adsorption capacity qa (mmol CO2/g adsorbent) on the adsorbent
over the adsorption
time is calculated by integrating the corresponding breakthrough curves 21  where T0 = 273
K, T is the adsorption temperature in K, ta is the adsorption time in min, Qa is the volumetric flow rate of the gas flow in mL/min, cin and cout are
the CO2 concentrations of the inlet and outlet gas flows
in vol %, ms is the mass of the adsorbent
in the tube reactor in g, and Vm = 22.4
L/mol.

CO2 uptake is mainly contributed by the amino
groups
of the adsorbent, and the maximum CO2/N ratio achievable
by the chemical reaction with solid amine adsorbents is 0.5 mol of
CO2/mol of N as eq 1. So the amino group content, cA (wt %), was calculated by 22  where cA0 is the content of amino groups after pretreatment in wt %,
Δm is the weight loss of amino groups in wt
%, and MPEI is the molecular mass of PEI
chain unit in g/mol.

The initial CO2 uptake of the
adsorbent for 0.4% (v)
CO2 at 20 °C is about 50 mg/g.
