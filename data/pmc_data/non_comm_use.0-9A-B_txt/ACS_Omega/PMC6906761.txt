TiOxNy/TiO2 was synthesized by nitriding of TiO2 in NH3 gas. TiOxNy/TiO2 generated hydrogen from methanol
aqueous
solution under visible-light irradiation. It was revealed by N K-edge
XANES and N 1s XPS measurements that the N species contributing to
visible-light responsiveness was the O-Ti-N species. The structure
of TiOxNy/TiO2 showing the photocatalytic activity was a double shell type
with thin layers of TiOxNy that covers the TiO2 core. Although N
content on the surface decreased during the photocatalytic reaction,
N was supplied from the deeper side to keep the TiOxNy phase at the surface and the
activity as well.

==== Body
Introduction
TiO2 is the most widely studied
photocatalyst in water
splitting or photodecomposition of organic pollutants in air and water.1,2 However, the band gap of TiO2 is too wide (3.2 eV) to
use visible light that is a major part of sunlight. Therefore, narrowing
its band gap is necessary to increase energy efficiency of utilization
of solar light. Many studies for the band gap narrowing of TiO2 have been reported such as doping of transition-metal cations
and partly reducing TiO2.3,4 Recently, oxynitrides
of Ti have attracted attention as visible-light responsive photocatalysts
because of their narrower band gap than TiO2.5 Zheng et al. have reported that the TiOxNy/TiN core–shell
structure synthesized by quick oxidation of TiN showed photocatalytic
activity for hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation.6 Since TiN is basically metallic, some modification
is mandatory to be an active photocatalyst.7 Li et al. have proposed to use mesoporous TiN microspheres with
an egg-shaped shell type structure.8 Yang
et al. have demonstrated that the heterojunction of TiOxNy and TiN on the TiOxNy/TiN composite
enhanced photocatalytic activity.9 In these
previous reports, the role and/or chemical state of N in TiOxNy/TiN or TiOxNy/TiO2 (referred to as oxynitride composites) having photocatalytic activity
has not been discussed in detail.

In addition, the stability
of the oxynitride composites under photocatalytic
water splitting or other reductive reactions is discussed.10−12 One is loss of activity caused by N removal during photocatalytic
reactions, and the other is the stability of the oxynitride composites
under some oxidation required for their industrial use such as calcination
or heat treatment in air.

These research situations of the oxynitride
composites as photocatalysts
motivate us to investigate the chemical state of N in the oxynitride
and its role for the photocatalytic water splitting and to examine
the stability of N in mild oxidation conditions.

Results are
reported in two series of papers. In this paper (referred
to as paper I) entitled as “Characterization of N in TiOxNy/TiO2 Photocatalyst”, we have
performed nitriding of TiO2 in NH3 gas to synthesized
TiOxNy/TiO2, which was used as a photocatalyst to generate hydrogen from
methanol aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation. TiOxNy/TiO2 was also subjected to detailed characterization with a particular
focus on the chemical state of N by means of XANES and XPS. In a succeeding
paper (referred to as paper II) entitled as “Degradation of
Photocatalytic Activity of TiOxNy/TiO2 with Mild Oxidation”,
the stability of N in TiOxNy/TiO2 and/or TiOxNy/TiO2 itself under mild
oxidation conditions was examined. To investigate the role of N in
TiOxNy/TiO2, the results of papers I and II were used comprehensively
in each discussion section.

Results
Water Splitting
Figure 1 shows an integrated hydrogen amount produced by the
water splitting for all samples. As seen in the figure, all samples
except Pt/JRC-TIO-7 (original anatase TiO2 sample) showed
catalytic activity. TON-850 showed an induction period of 1 h to detect
hydrogen evolution. This is probably because the electrons generated
by photoexcitation during the first hour were used to reduce deposited
nano-Pt particles to be metallic.13 Since
the activity of TON-950 or TON-1050 was higher than that of TON-850,
no induction period appeared. The nitriding samples continued their
catalytic activity for 5 h, showing a nearly constant hydrogen production
rate with larger rates for higher nitriding temperature. Hydrogen
evolution over TiN was negligible.

Figure 1 Hydrogen production from methanol aqueous
solution over JRC-TIO-7
(filled circle), TON-850 (triangle), TON-950 (square), and TON-1050
(diamond) under visible-light irradiation. On all samples, 1 wt% Pt
was deposited as the cocatalyst.

Characterization
Before Use (As-Prepared)
XRD patterns and TEM images
of all samples are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. As seen
in Figure 3a, the starting
material of anatase (JRC-TIO-7) was very fine particles, and accordingly,
its XRD pattern consisted of broad peaks of the anatase crystalline.
In XRD patterns, TON-850 exhibited only the anatase phase (ICSD #202243),
while TON-950 and -1050 showed an fcc phase of TiOxNy (ICSD #426340) additionally.
XRD patterns of the anatase phase became intense and sharper with
increasing nitriding temperature, indicating an improvement of crystallinity
and grain growth of the anatase phase.

Figure 2 X-ray diffraction patterns
of the samples: (a) JRC-TIO-7, (b) TON-850,
(c) TON-950, and (d) TON-1050. The right figure shows an expanded
XRD pattern from 41 to 46°.

Figure 3 TEM images of the samples: (a) JRC-TIO-7, (b) TON-850,
(c) TON-950,
and (d,e) TON-1050. The inset on the upper right in each image is
an enlarged one.

Both are evidenced by TEM observations in Figure 3. Growth of the particle
sizes is clear together
with the appearance of lattice fringes corresponding to a lattice
spacing of 3.4 Å for the (101) plane of the anatase in Figure 3a–d. It should
be noted that strong contrast appeared at the edges of the particles
in the TEM images of nitriding samples and the edge became darker
with increasing nitriding temperature. The edge of particles on TON-950
consisted of a dark small particle (see Figure 3c). Considering that TEM images become darker
with the increase of electron density, the darker small particles
are likely TiOxNy particles. Actually, TON-1050 (Figure 3d,e) shows a different lattice fringe with
a lattice spacing of 2.4 Å, corresponding to the (111) plane
of TiOxNy with
the fcc phase in addition to the (101) anatase fringe.

All the
above results are summarized in Table 1 together with the specific surface areas
of the samples after Pt loading. The surface area decreased with increasing
nitriding temperature, which well corresponds to the growth of the
particle sizes. This also supports that the nitriding and the grain
growth simultaneously proceeded.

Figure 4 shows the
UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra for all samples. The original
TiO2 (JRC-TIO-7) shows a clear cutoff at around 380 nm,
corresponding to the band gap of TiO2, while all nitriding
samples show absorption above 380 nm with its intensity stronger for
the higher nitriding temperature. The absorption in the wavelength
region from 500 to 800 nm has been attributed to Ti3+.14 This suggests that Ti4+ was reduced
by the nitriding corresponding to the formation of TiOxNy.

Figure 4 UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra of the samples: (a) JRC-TIO-7,
(b) TON-850, (c) TON-950, and (d) TON-1050.

Figure 5i,ii shows
the N 1s and O 1s XPS spectra, respectively, of TON-850, -950, -1050,
and TiN. In N 1s XPS spectra, a peak that appeared at 396 eV for TON-950
and -1050 is attributed to N bonded to Ti (Ti–N bond formation).
The O 1s XPS spectrum of JRC-TIO-7 shows three O 1s peaks at 530.1,
532.3, and 534.0 eV. The first and second peaks are assigned to Ti–O–Ti
bonding of lattice oxygen (OL) and OH groups on the surface
(OOH), respectively.15 The third
peak is most likely caused by C–O bonding (OC) in
some surface contaminants in air.16 With
increasing nitriding temperature, (OL) shifted to higher
binding energy, which is the indication of an increase in N content.
Actually, (OL) of TON-1050 showed almost the same binding
energy as that of commercial TiN whose surface was oxidized. The intensities
of (OOH) and (OC) increased until the nitriding
temperature was 950 K, and the intensity decreased in TON-1050. Such
intensity changes of (OOH) and (OC) are probably
due to the fluctuation of the intensity of the C 1s peak given by
the surface contaminants.

Figure 5 (i) N 1s and (ii) O 1s XPS spectra of the samples:
(a) JRC-TIO-7,
(b) TON-850, (c) TON-950, (d) TON-1050, and (e) commercial TiN.

All above characterization can be summarized as
follows. TON-950
included the fcc phase of TiOxNy, which covered most of its surface. TiOxNy was not well
crystallized and hence easily adsorbed surface contaminants. In contrast,
the TiOxNy phase on TON-1050 was more stabilized making thicker layers with
less surface contaminants.

The formation of TiOxNy on TON-950 and TON-1050
is also confirmed in normalized
N K-edge XANES spectra of TON-950 and TON-1050 given in Figure 6, in which appeared a double
peaked structure specified to the formation of O–Ti–N.

Figure 6 N K-edge
XANES spectra of the samples: (a) TON-850, (b) TON-950,
and (c) TON-1050. The arrows indicate the features of double peak
structures, which are attributed to O–Ti–N species.

Thus, the formation of TiOxNy on TiO2 is very likely
the cause
of photocatalytic activities of TON-950 and TON-1050 on the water
splitting under visible-light irradiation as will be discussed later.

After Use of the Highest Active Sample (TON-1050) for 5 h
Figure 7a–c
shows the XRD patterns, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra,
and N K-edge XANES spectra before and after the photocatalytic reaction
for the highest active sample of TON-1050, respectively. In Figure 7a,b, differences
between the two samples were small. In contrast, N K-edge XANES changed
significantly (see Figure 7c). In the TON-1050 after use, the intensity of the spectrum
decreased while maintaining the peak structure.

Figure 7 Comparison of TON-1050
before and after the photocatalytic reaction:
(a) XRD, (b) UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra, and (c) N
K-edge XANES spectra.

The difference was also appreciable in the N 1s
XPS spectra of
TON-1050 as shown in Figure 8a,b for before and after use, respectively. In the figures,
sequential changes of the spectra with Ar ion sputtering time corresponding
to depth are given. Although the peak intensity and structure did
not change in TON-1050 before and after use, in TON-1050 after use,
the intensity decreased with Ar sputtering time without changing peak
shape. Converting the Ar sputtering time to sputtered depth, the XPS
peak intensity ratios of N 1s to Ti 2p (not shown here) are plotted
against the sputtered depth in Figure 8c. In TON-1050 before use, N distributed homogeneously
into a depth of over 30 nm with an atomic ratio of N/Ti of around
0.35, while N concentration within 20 nm from the surface decreased
in TON-1050 after use. Considering no appreciable change in the shape
of N 1s XPS spectra, the surface of TON-1050 after use still kept
the TiOxNy phase with the same chemical state of N as that before use, and
hence, the photocatalytic activity was kept for a reaction time of
over 5 h.

Discussion
N Species Contributing to Visible-Light Responsiveness
As described above, nitriding of TiO2 under NH3 formed TiOxNy on the surface of TiO2. The N content in TiOxNy reached about 0.3
N/Ti ratio in TON-1050. The nitriding probably proceeds as follows.
At first, some O atoms in TiO2 are removed by H2 generated by decomposition of NH3 followed by substitution
of a remaining oxygen vacancy by N (Figure 5ii).17 With increasing
amount of substituting N atoms, nucleation or precipitation of fcc-phase
TiOxNy starts
on the surface of TiO2 because of quite small solubility
of N in TiO2 and followed by growth of the TiOxNy precipitates (as seen
in Figure 3b,c). Further
nitriding causes the growth of the thickness of the TiOxNy layers with growth
of particle size as seen in Figure 3d,e. Further nitriding at higher temperature proceeds
to substitution of O atoms in TiOxNy by N, which finally changes to TiN.18

In these nitriding processes, three types
of bonding of N have been reported: two types of N occupying the lattice
site of TiOxNy and/or TiN as N–Ti–N and O–Ti–N accompanying
some lattice distortion and one molecular type as O–N–O
species (NOx) and/or N2 substituting
an O site or enlarged interstitial sites. In addition, a very tiny
amount of N could be retained in the anatase phase. As expected from
the metallic nature of TiN, it was not active for the water splitting.
Therefore, contribution of N–Ti–N bonding for visible-light
responsiveness must be very low. In paper II, we have observed that
oxidation of TiOxNy produced NOx-like molecular
species, which inhibit photocatalytic activity rather than providing
visible-light responsiveness. In our previous study, we have found
that O–Ti–N species in TiO2 contributed to
visible-light responsiveness.19−21 Thus, the formation of O–Ti–N
bonding in TiOxNy is most likely the origin of the photocatalytic water splitting
under visible-light irradiation. Actually, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, higher nitriding temperature led to higher photocatalytic activity
with the increase in the intensity of the peak due to TiOxNy in XRD. However, full
nitriding at higher temperature to make TiN suppress the activity.

Stability of O–Ti–N Species in TiOxNy
The prepared
samples kept H2 evolution more than 5 h, while Pan et al.
reported that N in oxynitride was unstable during the photocatalytic
reaction.11 Therefore, we have characterized
the most active sample of TON-1050 before and after use. As seen in Figure 7a,b, the crystalline
structure and optical absorption of TON-1050 hardly changed; that
is, the bulk state hardly changed before and after the reaction. However,
the N content (given in N/Ti ratio) in near surface regions decreased
to 0.1 after use from 0.3 before use. This is a clear indication of
N removal as already reported by Abe et al.12 The cause was attributed to N2 evolution by the reaction
of the photogenerated hole (h+) and N in the surface region.
Nevertheless, catalytic activity was kept for at least 5 h. Considering
the observation that N kept the initial chemical state after use and
that the appearance of the concentration gradient of N from the deeper
side to the surface, N must be supplied by diffusion from the deeper
side. Namely, as far as the TiOxNy phase remains at the near surface region, the
photocatalytic activity would remain. This behavior is completely
different from the deactivation of TiOxNy given by oxidation in mild oxidation
conditions reported in paper II in which N was oxidized to form O–N–O
species (NOx) and remained near the surface
resulting in the deactivation. In the present work, there was no indication
of NOx formation and the catalytic activity
remained over 5 h. Nevertheless, loss of N would continue, and some
stabilization of TiOxNy is necessary for its practical use.

Conclusions
We have succeeded to prepare the N-doped
TiO2 photocatalyst
with activity for water splitting in methanol solution under visible
light and investigated the role of N on water splitting with various
characterization techniques. N doping was done by nitriding of anatase
(TiO2) under NH3 gas flow at a temperature ranging
from 850 to 1050 K. The N-doped TiO2, which shows the catalytic
activity for water splitting, exhibits two phase structures: the anatase
phase probably containing some N and the cubic structure of TiOxNy that grew on
the surface of the anatase.

The content of the TiOxNy phase in the samples
increased with nitriding temperature
accompanying the increase of hydrogen evolution. This indicates that
TiOxNy works
as visible-light responsiveness species for photocatalytic hydrogen
evolution. The chemical state of N in TiOxNy is characterized by N K-edge XANES
and found to be bonded directly to Ti and O atoms making N–Ti–O
species.

From depth profiling of N, N in the as-prepared samples
was homogeneously
contained more than 30 nm in depth, while the N content within 10
nm from the surface was reduced after 5 h of photocatalytic water
splitting; even at that time, the catalytic activity was maintained.
Nevertheless, loss of N would continue, and the photocatalytic activity
would reduce for a longer reaction time.5 Therefore, some stabilization of TiOxNy is necessary for its practical use.

In conclusion, N making O–Ti–N species in TiOxNy provided the
visible-light responsiveness for the water splitting. However, N is
removed from the surface during the reaction. If some N were supplied
from the inside to keep the cubic TiOxNy phase at the surface, the photocatalytic
activity would be continued.

Experiments
Synthesis of TiOxNy/TiO2 Photocatalyst Samples
Synthesis
of TiOxNy/TiO2, N doping in TiO2, and nitriding of TiO2 were done under NH3 gas flow at 850, 950, and 1050 K
for 3 h, respectively. As a starting material, anatase-type TiO2 (JRC-TIO-7, Japan Reference Catalyst) was used. Thus, obtained
samples are referred to as TON-X (X denotes nitriding temperature). Commercially available TiN (Mitsuwa
Chemicals) was also examined as one of the samples.

Characterization of the Samples
Diffuse reflectance
spectra of the samples were measured by a UV–vis–NIR
spectrometer (JASCO, V-670) in the wavelength range of 200–850
nm. The reflectance was converted to the absorbance by the Kubelka–Munk
function with BaSO4 as a standard. Crystal structures of
the samples were identified by X-ray diffraction analysis (RIGAKU,
RINT-TTRIII). Morphology of the samples was observed by a transmission
electron microscope (JEOL, JEM-2100F). The concentration and chemical
state of N in the samples were investigated by XPS (X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy) (Shimadzu, ESCA-3400HSE). N K-edge XANES spectra of
the samples were measured with the BL7U at Aichi Synchrotron Radiation
Center at room temperature in the total electron yield mode. The specific
surface areas of the samples were determined by the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller
(BET) method (MOUNTECH, Macsorb HM-1220).

Water Splitting under Visible-Light Irradiation
In
order to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the samples, the
half reaction of water splitting under visible light using methanol
aqueous solution was carried out. The reaction is referred simply
to as hydrogen evolution hereafter. 1 wt % Pt nanoparticles as a cocatalyst
was deposited on the samples by a photodeposition method.22 The sample (0.1 g) was put into 10 mL of 20
vol % methanol aqueous solution in a quartz cell under He gas flow
with a flow rate of 3 mL/min. Methanol was used as a hole acceptor.
The cell was irradiated with visible light (λ > 440) given
off
by a 300 W xenon lamp with cutting UV light by a cutoff filter, L-44
(Opto Sigma, SCF-50S-44Y). The produced hydrogen gas was analyzed
with a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, TCD-GC, GC-8A).
