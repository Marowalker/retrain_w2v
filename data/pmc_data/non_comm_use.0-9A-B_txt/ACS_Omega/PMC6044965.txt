Multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become one of the
major causes of various infections,
leading to morbidity in both healthy and immune-compromised populations
worldwide. Herein, we report a novel type of hybrid photosensitizer
based on amphiphilic block copolymer-functionalized gold nanoparticles.
The design of the nanoparticles provides a facile means to incorporate
hydrophobic photosensitizing molecules for use in aqueous media. The
hybrid photosensitizers display greatly enhanced singlet oxygen generation
and outstanding photodynamic inactivation (PDI) efficacy against MRSA
under light illumination. These hybrid photosensitizers greatly improve
the effectiveness of PDI against MRSA while not involving antibiotics.

1 Introduction
Many human and animal
diseases are caused by microorganisms.1−3 Over the last several
decades, treatments have been developed to
overcome this problem, and the development of antibiotics to treat
bacterial infections represents one of the most revolutionary advances
in the scientific field.4−7 However, bacteria have gradually developed resistance
to antibiotics over the time, and nowadays, many previously highly
effective antibiotics have failed to combat the pathogens. One of
the dangerous pathogens is the multidrug-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus, commonly known as MRSA. It
is a gram-positive bacterium, resistant toward multiple β-lactam
antibiotics such as methicillin, penicillin, oxacillin, and amoxillin.8−16 MRSA can cause infections ranging from skin conditions to life-threatening
pneumonia. According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention,
over 80 000 invasive MRSA infections and 11 285 related
deaths occur every year.17 Therefore, MRSA
has become a major concern of public health. As such, there is an
urgent need for the development of novel and convenient ways to combat
these drug-resistant pathogens.

Photodynamic inactivation of
bacteria (PDI) is considered as one
of the promising approaches to overcome the problem of drug resistance.
PDI utilizes a photosensitizer, oxygen, and light of appropriate wavelength.
The combination of these components produces reactive oxygen species
(ROS), such as singlet oxygen, which is highly toxic to pathogens,
including the drug-resistant bacteria.18−24 Furthermore, it is not known that bacteria develop resistance toward
ROS. Thus, PDI has drawn an increasing attention in recent years.25,26

Still, PDI suffers some shortcomings. For instance, most photosensitizers
are highly hydrophobic and tend to aggregate in the aqueous media.
Many photosensitizers show low-to-moderate quantum yield in generating
ROS and cannot be excited using long-wavelength light, such as red
or infrared light, which has larger tissue penetration depth than
blue or green light. These factors limit their use in clinical applications.27−29 Recently, we have reported nanoparticle-based hybrid photosensitizers,
which demonstrated highly efficient singlet oxygen generation because
of plasmonic resonance between the silver nanoparticles and the photosensitizing
molecules, and high efficacy in photoinactivating broad-spectrum bacteria.30−32 These hybrid photosensitizers also displayed broadened excitation
profile, allowing them to be excited by red/infrared light sources.

Herein, we report the development of a new hybrid photosensitizer,
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with a block copolymer (BCP)
loaded with Chlorin e6 (Ce6), for efficient antibacterial applications.
Our experimental results show that the hybrid photosensitizers display
greatly enhanced singlet oxygen generation and high efficiency in
photoinactivating the MRSA.

2 Results and Discussion
The schematic illustration of the synthesis of AuNP@BCP@Ce6 is
shown in Figure 1.
An amphiphilic BCP, poly(NIPAAm-b-styrene), is used
in this study. The AuNPs (∼40 nm) were first synthesized using
the citrate method according to the literature.33 Poly(NIPAAm-b-styrene) was then conjugated
to these AuNPs through its thiol end to the Au surface, forming AuNP@BCP,
which could be well-dispersed in water because of the hydrophilic
poly(NIPAAm-b-styrene) block of the polymer. The
photosensitizing molecule, Ce6, is hydrophobic and hardly soluble
in water. However, when mixing with AuNP@BCP in aqueous solution,
Ce6 can be entrapped in the hydrophobic styrene block of AuNP@BCP.
The resulting AuNP@BCP@Ce6 hybrids are stable for weeks in aqueous
solution without aggregation. This design facilitates Ce6 to be dispersible
in aqueous solution while simultaneously brings Ce6 close to the AuNPs,
which is required for the plasmonic effect described later.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of synthesis of BCP-functionalized, Ce6-entrapped
AuNPs (AuNP@BCP@Ce6).

AuNP, AuNP@BCP, and AuNP@BCP@Ce6 were characterized using
transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), particle size analysis, and ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectroscopy. TEM images show a uniform
distribution of AuNPs with an average size of ∼40 nm, whereas
AuNP@BCP@Ce6 hybrids show an average size of ∼100 nm (Figure 2). The change in
the overall nanoparticle size was likely due to the increased contrast
of the BCP coating after the loading of Ce6 molecules. The zeta potentials
were found to be −30 mV for AuNPs and −34 mV for AuNP@BCP@Ce6
hybrids, suggesting their good stability in aqueous solution.

Figure 2 TEM images
of AuNP (left, scale bar is 50 nm) and AuNP@BCP@Ce6
(right, scale bar is 20 nm).

UV–vis absorption spectra of pure Ce6, AuNP@BCP, AuNP,
BCP,
and AuNP@BCP@Ce6 are shown in Figure 3a. AuNP@BCP has a strong peak at ∼530 nm, typical
for AuNPs of the similar size. Ce6 has three peaks at around 400,
530, and 640 nm. The spectral overlap between AuNP@BCP and Ce6 indicates
the possibility of resonance coupling between the two in the AuNP@BCP@Ce6
hybrids. It is one of the reasons that Ce6 was chosen for this study.

Figure 3 (a) UV–vis
absorption spectra of Ce6, AuNP, BCP, AuNP@BCP,
and AuNP@BCP@Ce6 hybrid. (b) Fluorescence spectra of Ce6 and AuNP@BCP@Ce6
hybrid.

Fluorescence spectra of pure Ce6
and AuNP@BCP@Ce6 are shown in Figure 3b. The Ce6 concentrations
in both pure Ce6 and AuNP@BCP@Ce6 were maintained the same while taking
the fluorescence spectra. As shown, the fluorescence intensity of
pure Ce6 was much higher than that of AuNP@BCP@Ce6. This could be
due to self-quenching of the entrapped Ce6 in AuNP@BCP@Ce6.

The singlet oxygen generation was measured by monitoring its phosphorescence
emission at ∼1280 nm. As shown in Figure 4a, the singlet oxygen generation of AuNP@BCP@Ce6
was higher than that of pure Ce6 and AuNP@BCP under 400 nm excitation.
Note that in these measurements the concentration of Ce6 in both pure
Ce6 and AuNP@BCP@Ce6 was 0.24 μM and that AuNP@BCP and AuNP@BCP@Ce6
have the same amount of AuNP. Compared to pure Ce6, there is a ∼twofold
enhancement for AuNP@BCP@Ce6 in singlet oxygen generation. We attribute
the increase in singlet oxygen generation by AuNP@BCP@Ce6 compared
to pure Ce6 to the plasmonic effect of the AuNPs. In addition, the
singlet oxygen excitation spectra in Figure 4b show that the excitation profile for AuNP@BCP@Ce6
is broadened, extending into the red and near-infrared regions. This
has a great implication for applications requiring tissue penetration.

oxygen emission (a) and excitation (b) spectra of Ce6,
AuNP@BCP, and AuNP@BCP@Ce6 hybrid.

The cytotoxicity of the AuNP@BCP@Ce6 hybrids without light
illumination
was evaluated by a standard methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay
using MCF-7 cell line (ATCC HTB-22). Results shown in Figure 5 indicate that the AuNP@BCP@Ce6
hybrids at the concentrations used in the PDI assay display little
cytotoxicity toward the MCF-7 cells under ambient conditions.

Figure 5 Cell viability
of MCF-7 cells treated with various concentrations
of AuNP@BCP@Ce6 hybrids without light illumination.

PDI of bacteria was carried out using AuNP@BCP@Ce6,
pure Ce6, and
AuNP@BCP against MRSA (ATCC BAA-44) with or without light illumination.
From the results shown in Figure 6, none of the AuNP@BCP@Ce6, pure Ce6, or AuNP@BCP killed S. aureus at the tested concentrations without light
illumination. Under white light illumination for 3 min, pure Ce6 and
AuNP@BCP show negligible photoinactivation efficacy against S. aureus, whereas AuNP@BCP@Ce6 demonstrates much
higher photoinactivation efficiency under the same conditions. Note
that in all these PDI experiments, similar to the spectroscopic measurements,
AuNP@BCP@Ce6 and pure Ce6 have the same amount of Ce6 concentration
and AuNP@BCP@Ce6 and AuNP@BCP contain the same amount of AuNP. These
results demonstrate that the (1) photothermal effect of AuNP@BCP is
negligible under the experimental conditions and (2) AuNP@BCP@Ce6
displays a synergistic PDI effect as compared to pure Ce6 and AuNP@BCP.
The enhancement of PDI efficiency is defined as log10(enhancement)
= log10(AuNP@BCP@Ce6_killing) – log10(AuNP@BCP_killing) – log10(Ce6_killing). The results
for the enhancement of AuNP@BCP@Ce6 in PDI are shown in Figure 6c. It is worthwhile to point
out that AuNP@BCP@Ce6 demonstrates up to ∼6 orders of magnitude
in the enhancement of PDI efficiency against S. aureus when compared with AuNP@BCP and pure Ce6.

AuNP@BCP, and AuNP@BCP@Ce6 hybrid against

hybrid. Enhancement in bacterial killing efficacy is defined in the
text. Results are expressed as mean ± SD (n =
3, p < 0.05).

Note that the hybrid photosensitizer developed in this study,
AuNP@BCP@Ce6,
is different from another hybrid photosensitizer shown in our previous
report, AgNP@BCP@HP, where the Ag nanoparticles had to be synthesized
in the presence of the BCP.31 By contrast,
the AuNPs in AuNP@BCP@Ce6 can be synthesized independently, not necessarily
limited by the citrate method adopted in this study. This opens up
the possibility of screening AuNPs of optimal sizes to have high plasmonic
resonance with the photosensitizing molecule, Ce6, in this instance.
In essence, this type of hybrid nanostructures serves as a platform
to assemble plasmon-enhanced hybrid photosensitizers, where the two
key components, metal particles and photosensitizing molecules, can
be individually tailored to achieve a large degree of resonance coupling
and improve the singlet oxygen generation and overall PDI performance
of the hybrid.

In summary, we have reported the development
of a type of hybrid
photosensitizers, BCP-functionalized, Ce6-entrapped AuNPs, which display
greatly enhanced singlet oxygen generation, and significant PDI efficiency
against the MRSA under white light illumination. This design allows
to incorporate hydrophobic photosensitizing molecules for use in aqueous
media. These novel hybrid photosensitizers demonstrate great potential
as an alternative to antibiotics for antibacterial applications.

3 Methods
3.1 Chemicals and Reagents
Gold chloride
(99%), sodium citrate dihydrate, tetrahydrofuran (THF), Ce6, ethanol,
and phosphate buffer saline (PBS, 10× solution) were purchased
from Fisher Scientific. Trypticase soy broth (TSB) and Mueller Hinton
II broth were purchased from Becton Dickinson. S. aureus (ATCC BAA-44) and MCF-7 cell line (ATCC HTB-22) were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA). N-Isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm, 99%), 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile)
(99%), and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium borohydride was purchased
from Fluka. All chemicals were used as received.

3.2 Synthesis of BCP-Functionalized AuNPs
3.2.1 Synthesis
of AuNPs
The AuNPs (∼40
nm) were prepared using a citrate stabilized method based on the previously
published procedure.33 In brief, 125 μL
of gold(III) chloride was dissolved in 9.8 mL of water. The solution
was then heated to boil under stirring. Upon boiling, 100 μL
of 1 w/w % sodium citrate was added rapidly. The colloid was boiled
for 5 min to ensure complete reduction. The resulting AuNPs were pelleted
by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 20 min. The AuNPs were washed with
deionized (DI) water to remove excess ions and dispersed in DI water
for later use.

3.2.2 Synthesis of AuNP@Poly(NIPAAm-b-styrene) Nanoparticles
The poly(NIPAAm-b-styrene) polymer used in this study is the same as reported
in the
previous study, where the synthesis of poly(NIPAAm-b-styrene) was described in detail.31 For
the synthesis of the poly(NIPAAm-b-styrene)-stabilized
AuNP, 10.0 mg of poly(NIPAAm-b-styrene) was dissolved
in 1.00 mL of THF. While stirring, 1.00 mL of AuNP (∼40 nm)
solution was added to the THF solution. The mixture was stirred for
1 h at room temperature. The products were centrifuged at 14 000
rpm for 20 min and washed three times with DI water. The as-synthesized
AuNP@poly(NIPAAm-b-styrene) nanoparticles, noted
as AuNP@BCP, were dispersed in DI water for later use.

3.2.3 Synthesis of AuNP@BCP@Ce6 Hybrids
The freshly prepared
AuNP@BCP nanoparticles were used for the synthesis
of AuNP@BCP@Ce6 hybrids. In brief, 10.0 mg of Ce6 was dissolved in
2.00 mL of ethanol and centrifuged at 5000 rpm to collect the supernatant.
From the freshly prepared Ce6, 2.00 mL of supernatant was added into
the freshly prepared AuNP@BCP under vigorous stirring. The mixture
was stirred overnight at room temperature, and the resulting nanoparticles
were pelleted by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 20 min. The
resulting nanoparticles, noted as AuNP@BCP@Ce6 hybrids, were then
washed three times with the ethanol/water mixture (50/50) to remove
any excess of Ce6. The as-synthesized nanoparticles were dispersed
in DI water and stored at 4 °C for later use.

3.3 Characterization
The freshly synthesized
nanoparticles (AuNP and AuNP@BCP@Ce6) were characterized using a Phillip
BioTwin 12 TEM. A drop of the sample aqueous solution was placed and
dried onto a carbon-coated copper grid (300 mesh, EMS). A particle
size analyzer (Microtrac) was used to measure the zeta potential and
the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles.

A UV–vis
spectrometer (USB4000-ISS, Ocean Optics) was used to determine the
loading amount of Ce6 using an absorbance at 400 nm. A series of solutions
with different concentrations of Ce6 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
were used to establish a calibration curve. Then, the absorbance at
400 nm of a known amount of the Au@BCP@Ce6 hybrid was measured, and
the loading amount of Ce6 in the Au@BCP@Ce6 hybrid was calculated
using the calibration curve.

The fluorescence and phosphorescence
measurements were carried
out using a QM-40 spectrometer (PTI) equipped with a photomultiplier
tube and a high-performance InGaAs photodiode. Singlet oxygen generation
was detected by monitoring its phosphorescence emission at ∼1280
nm. The light source was a xenon arc lamp, and the output was passed
through an optical chopper operating at a fixed frequency. A long-pass
filter (850 nm cutoff) was used to remove higher-order artifact signals.
All fluorescence and phosphorescence measurements were done in a quartz
cuvette, and the samples were dispersed in the ethanol/water (50/50)
solvent. The excitation wavelength used to collect fluorescence and
singlet oxygen emission spectra of Ce6 was 402 nm.

3.4 PDI Assay of Bacteria
Overnight cultures
of MRSA (ATCC BAA-44) were prepared on a TSB medium. Typically, S. aureus was inoculated in the PBS buffer solution
(pH = 7.4) and mixed with different concentrations of AuNP@BCP@Ce6,
pure Ce6, and AuNP@BCP in PBS. All bacterial suspensions (200 μL,
∼107 cfu/mL), including nontreated controls, were
transferred to the wells of a 96-well plate and illuminated under
a white light source with an interchangeable fiber bundle (model LC-122,
Lumacare) for 3 min. The white light intensity was measured using
a laser power meter (model 840011, Sper Scientific) and found to be
408 mW/cm2. The irradiation fluence was 73 J/cm2. After light illumination, the plate count method was used to determine
the viable bacterial numbers (cfu/mL) in each suspension. Dark controls
were run in parallel. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
The data were presented as the means with standard deviations. Statistical
significance was analyzed using the two-sample t-test,
and the probability value of <0.05 was considered significant.

3.5 Cell Viability Assays
The in vitro
cytotoxicity assay for the AuNP@BCP@Ce6 hybrids was carried out using
a standard MTT assay on the MCF-7 cells without light illumination.
Briefly, the MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2
mM l-glutamine, 100 units per mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL
streptomycin at 37 °C, in a tissue culture incubator with 5%
CO2 atmosphere. The cells (100 μL) were seeded in
the wells of a 96-well plate at the density of 10 000 cells/well.
After overnight incubation in the tissue culture incubator (37 °C,
5% CO2), the cells were treated for 24 h with various concentrations
of the AuNP@BCP@Ce6 hybrids. Next, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide in the PBS solution (5 mg/mL) was added to the culture medium
to reach a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. After the cells were
incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, the supernatants were removed, and
the formazan dye was dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO. The absorbance
was measured on a microplate reader at 490 nm with a reference wavelength
at 650 nm. Each experiment was done in six wells in parallel.
