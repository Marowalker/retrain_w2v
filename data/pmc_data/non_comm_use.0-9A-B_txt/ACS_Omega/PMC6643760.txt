Two
luminescent lead phosphonates with two-dimensional (2D) layer
and three-dimensional (3D) framework structure, namely, Pb3[(L1)2(Hssc)(H2O)2] (1) and [Pb2(L2)0.5(bts)(H2O)2]·H2O (2) (H2L1 = O(CH2CH2)2NCH2PO3H2, H4L2 = H2PO3CH2NH(C2H4)2NHCH2PO3H2,
H3ssc = 5-sulfosalicylic acid, NaH2bts = 5-sulfoisophthalic
acid sodium) have been prepared via hydrothermal techniques. The two
compounds not only show excellent thermal stability but also remain
intact in aqueous solution within an extensive pH range. Moreover,
the atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis experiment indicates that
there does not exist the leaching of Pb2+ ions from the
lead phosphonates, which show they are nontoxic in aqueous solution.
In compound 1, the Pb(1)O4, Pb(2)O7, Pb(3)O4, and CPO3 polyhedra are interlinked
into a one-dimensional chain, which is further connected to adjacent
chain by sharing the Hssc2– to form a 2D layer.
Interestingly, compound 1 as a highly selective and sensitive
luminescent material can be used to detect the thymine molecule with
a very low detection limit of 8.26 × 10–7 M.
In compound 2, the Pb(1)O6 and Pb(2)O5 polyhedra are interlinked into a dimer via edge sharing,
which is further connected to adjacent dimer to form a tetramer via
corner sharing, and such a tetramer is then interlinked into a 2D
layer through bts3– ligands; the adjacent 2D layers
are finally constructed to a 3D structure by sharing the L24– ligand. Compound 2 can be applied
as an excellent luminescent sensor for sensing of VO3– anion. Furthermore, the probable fluorescent quenching
mechanisms of the two compounds have also been studied.

Introduction
In the last few years,
design of artificial receptors to specifically
target DNA, RNA, and related important small molecules in aqueous
solutions has been attracting great interest due to their potential
application in the mimic systems for enzymes and clinical trials.1−4 The recognition process for nucleobases has obtained particular
attention because they play major roles in increasing genetic diversities
and genome function and, thus, are critical for the survival and adaptability
of the species.5 Therefore, the detailed
recognition of nucleobases is necessary for the complete understanding
of the genetic and epigenetic regulation.6,7 The
abnormal change in the base of the organisms suggests the mutation
and deficiency of the immunity system, which can lead to various diseases.8,9 So, the quantitative detection of thymine has great significance
in biological sciences and clinical medicine. To date, many methods
have been used to detect thymine molecule, including high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC), HPLC–mass spectrometry, monoclonal
antibodies, and electrochemical analysis.10−12 However, some
drawbacks such as low sensitivity, long analysis time, and expensive
equipment also exist in these above-mentioned methods.13 So, the fluorescence probe method has obtained
wide attention due to their high selectivity and sensitivity compared
with other methods mentioned above.14,15 On the other
hand, vanadium has received considerable attention due to its dual
physiological properties as a nutrient at lower concentrations and
as toxic substance at higher concentrations. And, in general, the
content of vanadium in natural samples is often lower, so it is of
urgent need to obtain some highly sensitive and reliable measurement
methods.16 For instance, vanadium ion is
one of the most important trace elements in human body that is involved
in glucose metabolism and diabetes treatment and can decrease the
blood glucose and blood lipid in diabetic patients.17 So far, some analytical methods about sensing of vanadium
(V) ions have been found, including atomic absorption spectroscopy
(AAS), HPLC, spectrophotometry, and electrochemical methods.18−20 However, the main disadvantages of the above-methods are that they
are laborious and require expensive equipment. Therefore, it is vital
to prepare a variety of sensing material based on readily obtained
novel materials.21−23

In recent decades, metal phosphonates have
been extensively investigated,
as they have great influences on the catalysis, porosity and separation,
magnetism, ion exchange, and proton conductivity.24−29 Some metal phosphonates have been used to prepare fluorescent-sensing
material because the component unit of metal phosphonates, including
the metal and organic ligand, can generate the luminescence to be
used to probe molecules or ions.30−32 At present, there are
a few studies on ions or molecular recognition properties based on
metal phosphonates, which are mainly focused on the sensing of the
Fe3+, Cu2+ cations, CrO42–/Cr2O72– anions, amino acids,
nitroaromatic explosive molecules, etc. For example, Fu et al. reported
a terbium phosphonate, with a rapid and selective sensing of nitroaromatic
explosives, that has a low detection limit (66 ppb).33 Yang et al. reported two terbium phosphonates used as luminescent
probe to detect Cu2+ cations in aqueous solution, which
exhibited the photoluminescence switching behavior modulated by the
photoinduced electron-transfer reaction.34 Our group also constructed three cadmium(II) carboxyphosphonates
with mixed ligands, which showed the highly selective sensing of the
tryptophan molecule.35 Although a few investigations
on recognition properties of luminescent metal phosphonates have been
reported recently, there are still no reports for detecting thymine
molecule and VO3– anion. Therefore, it
is still a challenge to achieve the sensing of the environmental and
biological ions or molecules based on these materials. As an expansion
of our work, by employing O(CH2CH2)2NCH2PO3H2 (H2L1) and H2PO3CH2NH(C2H4)2NHCH2PO3H2 (H4L2) as the phosphonate ligand and 5-sulfosalicylic
acid (H3ssc) or 5-sulfoisophthalic acid sodium salt (NaH2bts) as the mixed ligand, two luminescent lead phosphonate
with two-dimensional (2D) layer and three-dimensional (3D) framework
structure, namely, Pb3[(L1)2(Hssc)(H2O)2] (1) and [Pb2(L2)0.5(bts)(H2O)2]·H2O (2) have been obtained. Furthermore, the two
compounds have the potential applications as the highly selective
fluorescent probes for sensing of the thymine molecule or VO3– anion through the fluorescent quenching effect.
To the best of our knowledge, it is the first example of the sensing
of thymine molecule or VO3– anion utilizing
luminescent metal phosphonate materials.

Results and Discussion
Structure
Description of Compound 1
Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated that compound 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1̅
(Table S1). There are three crystallographically
independent Pb2+ ions, one Hssc2– ligands,
two L12– ligands, and two coordinated
water molecules in the structure unit of compound 1 (Figure 1). The corresponding
coordination environment of the three Pb2+ centers are
different, with the Pb1 and Pb3 ions being four-coordinated environment,
whereas Pb2 ion being seven-coordinated environment. Three of the
four coordination sites for Pb1 or Pb3 ions are filled with three
phosphonate oxygen atoms (O1, O2A, and O8A for Pb1 or O3, O7, and
O9 for Pb3) from three separate L12– anions
and the remaining one-coordination site is occupied by the one oxygen
atom (O5) from one coordinated water molecule for Pb1 or one oxygen
atom (O14) from Hssc2– ions for Pb3 to form the
PbO4 tetrahedral geometry. However, the coordination sites
for Pb2 ions are surrounded by seven oxygen atoms from four L12– ligands (O1, O2, O3A, O7, and O8A), one
Hssc2– ligands (O11), and one coordinated water
molecule (O6).

All H atoms are omitted for clarity. Thermal ellipsoids are drawn
at the 30% probability level. Symmetry code: (A) −x, −y, −z + 1 and
(B) −x + 1, −y, −z + 1.

The phosphonate molecule
is described as a tridentate ligand, whereas
the Hssc2– anion can act as a pentadentate ligand,
and they both show only one coordination mode (Figure 2a). Notably, each phosphonate oxygen atom
works as a μ2-type bridge linking to two Pb(II) ions
and each Hssc2– anion combines one Pb2 ion and one
Pb3 ion through carboxylate oxygen atom (O11) and sulfonate oxygen
atom (O14) (Figure 2b). The coordination mode and the structural characteristics of 5-sulfosalicylic
acid imply that compound 1 may be considered as a candidate
for selective probing of organic small molecules and anions. As shown
in Figure 2c, the Pb(1)O4, Pb(2)O7, and Pb(3)O4 polyhedra are
interlinked to CPO3 tetrahedra via edge and corner sharing
to form a one-dimensional inorganic chain in the a-axis, with the morpholinyl groups of L12– grafted in this chain. The neighboring chains are further constructed
into a 2D layer by sharing the Hssc2– (Figure 2d).

Structure Description of Compound 2
Single-crystal
XRD analysis indicated that compound 2 crystallizes in
the triclinic space group P1̅ (Table S1). There are two crystallographically
independent Pb2+ ions, one L24– ions, one bts3– ions, two coordinated water molecules,
and one lattice water molecule in the structure unit of compound 2 (Figure 3). The Pb1 is a six-coordinated environment, whereas Pb2 is a nine-coordinated
environment. Two of the six coordination sites for Pb1 ions are filled
with two phosphonate oxygen atoms (O1A and O2) from two L24– ligands and the remaining four coordination
sites are occupied by the four oxygen atom (O8B, O9F, O10C, and O4)
from four bts3– ligands to form the PbO6 octahedral geometry. However, the coordination sites for Pb2 ions
are surrounded by nine oxygen atoms from two L24– ligand (O3A, O1D, and O2D), two coordinated water (O12 and O13),
and three bts3– ligands (O7D, O8D, O7B, and O4).

1, −y + 1, −z + 1;
and (F) x, y – 1, z + 1.

The phosphonate molecule
is described as a hexadentate ligand,
whereas the bts3– anion can act as a heptdentate
ligand, and they both show only one coordination mode (Figure 4a). Notably, each phosphonate
oxygen atom (O3) from the L24– ligand
and each carboxylate oxygen atom (O9 and O10) from the bts3– ligand behave as a μ1 metal-linker linking to each
Pb(II) ions, whereas each phosphonate oxygen atom (O1 and O2) from
the L24– ligand, each sulfonate oxygen
atom (O4), and each carboxylate oxygen atom (O7 and O8) from the bts3– ligand work as a μ2-type bridge
linking to two Pb(II) ions (Figure 4b). As shown in Figure 4c, two Pb(1)O6 octahedra and two Pb(2)O9 polyhedra are interlinked to CPO3 tetrahedra via
edge and corner sharing to form a tetramer, which is further assembled
into a 2D layer by sharing bts3– in the ac-plane, and the neighboring layers are finally constructed
in a 3D structure by sharing the L2– ligand in the ab-plane (Figure 4d).

Thermal and Chemical Stability
Thermal
gravimetric
analyses (TGA) are used to study the thermal stabilities of the two
compounds. There exist two steps of weight losses in compounds 1 and 2 (Figure S1). The first step started at 50 °C for 1 and 2 and was completed at 108 °C for 1 (90
°C for 2), corresponding to the loss of two coordinated
water molecule. When the temperature was increased, the curve did
not show weight loss until 333 °C for 1 and 358
°C for 2. Above that temperature, it gradually lost
weight until 631 °C for 1 and 548 °C for 2, which can be attributed to the decomposition of the two
compounds. The final residues of the thermal decomposition of the
two compounds are Pb3(PO4)2 based
on powder XRD (Figure S2). To further investigate
the thermal stability of the two compounds, powder XRD is achieved
at 25–290 °C for 1 and 25–280 °C
for 2. The results show that the retention of the framework
is up to 270 °C for 1 and 240 °C for 2 (Figure 5).

temperatures.

In addition, the chemical
stability of compounds 1 and 2 were examined
under different pH conditions.
The solid samples were immersed in the solution of specified pH for
24 h at room temperature, and the XRD tests were carried out to prove
the integrity of the frameworks after washing and drying. The material
keeps intact in an aqueous solution within an extensive pH range of
3–13 for 1 and 4–12 for 2 (Figure 6). The above experiments
show that the two compounds have high thermal and chemical stability.
Moreover, to determine the leaching amount of Pb2+ ions
from the lead phosphonates, the atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)
test was carried out on the two compounds. And, the experimental result
indicates that there does not exist Pb2+ ions in the filtrate,
so the two compounds are nontoxic in an aqueous solution, which can
been used to detect some environmental and biological ions or molecules.

and 2 (b) at different pH values.

Luminescent Properties
The luminescent properties of
compound 1, H2L1, and H3ssc were examined at the excitation wavelength of 325 nm at room
temperature (Figure S3). The H2L1 exhibits weak emission bands at λmax = 428 nm, whereas H3ssc exhibits a strong emission band
at λmax = 372 and 439 nm, which can be due to intraligand
n → π* and π → π* charge transfer
(Figure S3c). In the case of compound 1, a large red-shifted photoluminescence with the main emission
at 405 and 452 nm are observed, which are red-shifted about 33 and
13 nm compared to that of free H3ssc (Figure S3), which indicates that the luminescence behavior
is attributed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer between the delocalized
π bonds of the H3ssc group and the p orbit of Pb2+ ions, and the red-shifted effect may be due to both coordination
or excited metal-perturbed intraligand state.36 The solid luminescent properties of compound 2, H4L2, and NaH2bts were investigated at
the excitation wavelength of 325 nm at room temperature (Figure S4). H4L2 exhibits
weak emission bands at λmax = 442 nm and NaH2bts exhibits a strong emission band at λmax = 438 nm, which can be due to the π → π* transition
for NaH2bts. Compound 2 shows two fluorescent
emission centered at 380 nm and 400 nm, which can be due to ligand-to-metal
charge transfer between the delocalized π bonds of the NaH2bts group and the p orbit of the Pb2+ ions. Blue-shifts
of the emission band of 2 is observed when compared to
the emission band of NaH2bts, which indicates that the
luminescence behavior is closely related to the coordinated environment
of the Pb2+ ions.37

Recognition
Properties toward Thymine (T)
Recently,
the recognition of biological small molecules by metal phosphonates
has attracted considerable attention. To study the possibility of
compound 1 for sensing of the biological molecules, five
nucleobases as analytes are investigated. In the five kinds of nucleobases,
the guanine (G) and adenine (A) belong to the purine family with a
double-loop structure, whereas uracil (U), cytosine (C), and thymine
(T) belong to the pyrimidine compounds with six-membered heterocyclic
structures (Figure 7). To begin with, five kinds of different nucleobases were soaked
in NaOH aqueous solutions, and the suspensions were obtained by adding
2.0 mg powders of 1 into 2.00 mL NaOH aqueous solutions.
Then, 0.5 mL of the prepared nucleobases aqueous solutions (1 ×
10–2 M) was added into the above suspensions and
the luminescence spectra were measured. Interestingly, the luminescence
intensities of compound 1 show a degree of quenching
upon interaction with five nucleobases, whereas thymine causes the
most obvious changes (Figure 8a). Above 78% of QE (quenching efficiency: (I0 – I)/I0 × 100%, I0 and I represent the luminescence intensity of 1 before and
after the addition of nucleobases, respectively) can be obtained with
the addition of only 5 × 10–6 mol of T.

and sizes of five kinds of nucleobases.

μL) of thymine aqueous solutions; (c) the Stern–Volmer
(SV) plot of different nucleobases at different concentrations; and
(d) comparison of the luminescence intensity of compound 1 exchanging with 0.01M T in the presence of other nucleobases.

To assess the sensitivity of compound 1 toward T in
detail, the luminescence quenching of compound 1 shows
a regular variation following the piecemeal addition 1 × 10–2 M of T from 0 to 500 μL (Figure 8b), and other four analytes produce no obvious
changes (Figure S5). To further study the
correlation between the degree of fluorescence quenching and the T
concentration, the quenching effect is determined by the Stern–Volmer
(SV) equation: I0/I =
1 + Ksv[M] (Ksv and [M] represents the quenching rate constant and molar concentration
of nucleobases, respectively), and the Ksv is calculated from the curve of relative luminescence intensity
(I0/I) against the concentration
of nucleobases.38 For T molecule, the Ksv value is calculated as 1.75 × 103 M–1, the regularity of concentration and
fluorescence intensity for the other nucleobases was not obvious (Figure 8c). Interference
experiments for compound 1 are performed by the addition
of thymine into the mixed solutions of compound 1 and
other four analytes (Figure 8d). As a result, the quenching efficiency of T in the presence
of other four analytes remained nearly the same (Figures S6a–S9a). The Ksv value are calculated as 1.49 × 103, 1.43 ×
103, 1.67 × 103, and 1.58 × 103 M–1 for T into the mixed solutions of compound 1 and other four analytes by the above formula (Figures S6b–S9b). The results reveal that
the selective detection of T in the existence of other analytes solutions
makes compound 1 as a sensitive material for T. The change
in the luminescence intensity is linear related to the T amount at
low concentration, with the detection limit of the material calculated
to be 8.26 × 10–7 M (Figure S10).

Mechanism of Luminescence Quenching (T)
To better understand
the fluorescence quenching effect of compound 1 on thymine,
the quenching mechanism was studied. First, the powder XRD pattern
of compound 1 after sensing of the T was very well consistent
with the parent compound 1, ruling out that the collapse
of the main framework of compound 1 induces variation
in the luminescence intensity (Figure S11). Second, considering that uracil, cytosine, and thymine have smaller
sizes than guanine and adenine, the nucleobases with smaller size
may enter into the interlayer of compound 1 more easily,
thus showing fluorescence quenching ability to compound 1. The sizes of 5 kinds of nucleobases were measured with Gaussian
09 (Figure 7). Third,
UV–vis absorption spectra of compound 1 were observed
to appear as a new absorption band at 290 nm after adding pyrimidine
analytes (uracil, cytosine, and thymine), which indicates that they
form a ground-state complex between compound 1 and pyrimidine
analytes (Figure S12).39,40 However, when the concentration of thymine increases, no new emission
peaks appear, further indicating that the ground-state complex does
not emit luminescence (Figure S13). Compound 1 and thymine formed a ground-state complex, reducing the
concentration of compound 1, resulting in a decrease
in the fluorescence intensity of the system.41,42 The luminescent quenching caused by T may be due to three actions:
(1) the uncoordinated oxygen atoms in sulfosalicylic acid may form
hydrogen bonds with thymine;43 (2) thymine
has a planar structure that may form a π–π stacking
interaction with benzene ring in sulfosalicylic acid;44 and (3) it is noteworthy that T has more one methyl than
U, so C–H/π plays a very important role in molecular
recognition. Compared with other pyrimidine molecules, the methyl
of thymine molecule may form a C–H/π interaction with
the benzene ring of 5-sulfosalicylic acid (Figure 9).45−47

Recognition Properties toward VO3–
The powder sample of compound 2 (2 mg) was
immersed in 2 mL of deionized water and 0.5 mL salt solutions of sodium
(1 × 10–2 M) (OH–, NO3–, F–, SO42–, HCO3–, Ac–, C6H5COO–, Cl–, Hbts2–, SiO32–,
H2PO4–, S2O42–, CO32–,
WO42–, and VO3–) was added into the above suspensions, which were then tested by
luminescence analyses. The luminescent measurements indicate that
different anions have different influence on the luminescent intensity
of compound 2. The fluorescence intensity of compound 2 did not change significantly for fifteen anions (OH–, NO3–, F–, SO42–, HCO3–, Ac–, C6H5COO–, Cl–, Hbts2–, SiO32–, H2PO4–, S2O42–, CO32–, and WO42–), but the
decrease in the luminescence intensities could be observed in the
presence of VO3– anion. Compared with
the initial compound 2, the luminescence intensity of
VO3– @ compound 2 is reduced
by 92% in the same test condition (Figure 10a).

Figure 10 (a) Quenching efficiency of compound 2 in 15 kinds
of anions aqueous solutions; (b) fluorescence quenching experiments
of standard suspensions of compound 2 with the addition
of different concentrations of VO3–;
(c) the Stem–Volmer (SV) quenching plot presented as I0/I – 1 versus VO3– concentration; and (d) the luminescence
intensity of compound 2 upon the addition of different
ions followed by VO3– anion.

The fluorescence quenching of compound 2 is significantly
affected by gradual addition of VO3– (Figure 10b). To further
study the correlation between the degree of fluorescence quenching
and the VO3– concentration, the quenching
effect is determined by the Stern–Volmer (SV) equation: I0/I = 1 + Ksv[VO3–] (Ksv and [VO3–] represents
the quenching rate constant and molar concentration of VO3–, respectively), and the Ksv is calculated from the curve of the relative luminescence
intensity (I0/I) against
the concentration of VO3–. The Ksv value is calculated as 7.35 × 103 M–1 for compound 2, which
has a strong quenching effect (Figure 10c).48 To further
study the interaction between compound 2 and VO3– anion, we added compound 2 to the
other fifteen kind of ion solutions and then added VO3– anion to the mixed solutions. As a result, the intensity
of emission peak for compound 2 quickly reduces upon
further addition of VO3– (Figure 10d). The above results reveal
that the highly selective sensing of VO3– in the existence of other analytes solutions make compound 2 a sensitive sensor for VO3–.

Mechanism of Luminescence Quenching (VO3–)
As far as we know, the fluorescent quenching mechanisms
of detecting heavy metal anions were due to collapse of the main framework,
competitive absorption of energy or resonance energy transfer in the
metal phosphonates. So, we carried out the following experiments of
compound 2. First, the XRD of compound 2 after sensing of the VO3– anion was
performed; the skeletons of compound 2 remain intact
after detecting VO3– anion (Figure S14), ruling out that the collapse of
the main framework of compound 2 induces variation in
the luminescence intensity. Second, if the absorption band of the
analytes overlap effectively with that of compound 2,
the competitive absorption of the irradiated light can cause luminescent
quenching between the compound and the analytes. So, the UV–vis
spectra of various anions have been determined to check this mechanism.
The VO3– anion in an aqueous solution
shows a broad absorption band from 260 to 310 nm, which overlaps a
little with that of compound 2 (200–270 nm), indicating
that the VO3– anion could not absorb
the excitation energy of compound 2 (Figure S15).49 So, the competitive
absorption is not the main reason for the luminescent quenching of
compound 2. Third, the emission spectrum of the fluorophore
partly overlaps the absorption spectra of the analytes, so resonance
energy transfer may occur between fluorophores and analytes, which
can greatly reduce the luminescent intensity.50,51 As shown in Figure S16, the emission
spectra of compound 2 partially overlap with the absorption
spectra of the VO3– aqueous solution,
which indicates that the resonance energy transfer should be the main
reason for the luminescent quenching of compound 2. Moreover,
the fluorescence lifetimes of compound 2 were reduced
from 1.59 to 0.38 ns in the presence of 200 μL VO3– aqueous solution, further indicating that there
are interactions between compound 2 and VO3– anion (Figure S17).

Conclusions
Two luminescent lead phosphonates with 2D layer
and 3D framework
structures have been prepared via hydrothermal techniques. The two
compounds have good thermal stability and excellent chemical stability
with high acid and base resistance in a wide pH range. Moreover, the
AAS analysis experiment indicates that there does not exist the leaching
of Pb2+ ions from the lead phosphonates, which show they
are nontoxic in aqueous solution. Compound 1 emerged
as a highly selective and sensitive sensor to detect the thymine molecule
with a very low detection limit of 8.26 × 10–7 M. Furthermore, the material also can identify the thymine molecule
in the presence of other nucleobases. The quenching mechanisms may
be mainly attributed to the hydrogen bonds, π–π
stacking interactions, and C–H/π interactions between
thymine and H3ssc of compound 1. Meanwhile,
compound 2 can be regarded as a highly selective and
sensitive luminescent sensor for detecting VO3– through the fluorescent quenching effect, and it can identify VO3– at lower concentration (1.52 × 10–7 M) with the presence of other interfering anions.
The quenching mechanisms indicate that the resonance energy transfer
should be the main reason for the luminescent quenching of compound 2. This work will encourage us to design and synthesize some
novel metal phosphonates and investigate their structures and the
recognition properties in the future.

Crystallographic Studies
X-ray diffraction data for
the two compounds were collected on a Bruker AXS Smart APEX II CCD
X-diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα (λ
= 0.71073 Å) at 300 K. The structures were solved by direct methods
and refined on F2 by full-matrix least-squares
methods by using the SHELX 97 program.53 All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The H atoms
of organic ligands were refined isotropically as a riding mode. Details
of crystallographic data, selected bond distances, and angles of the
two compounds are listed in Tables S1–S3, respectively. CCDC 1587687 and 1843247 contain the supplementary
crystallographic data of this article.

Fluorescence Measurements
In a typical experimental
setup, five kinds of different nucleobases were soaked in NaOH aqueous
solutions, and the suspensions were obtained by adding 2.0 mg powders
of 1 into 2.00 mL NaOH aqueous solutions. The fluorescence
upon excitation at 325 nm of compound 1 suspension was
measured in situ after incremental addition of freshly prepared nucleobases
solutions (1 × 10–2 M, 50 μL addition
each time).

The powder sample of compound 2 (2
mg) was immersed in 2 mL of deionized water and then the salt solution
of sodium (1 × 10–2 M) (OH–, NO3–, F–, SO42–, HCO3–,
Ac–, C6H5COO–, Cl–, Hbts2–, SiO32–, H2PO4–, S2O42–, CO32–, WO42–, and VO3–) was added into the above suspensions, which
then were tested by luminescence analyses. The fluorescence upon excitation
at 280 nm of compound 2 suspension was measured in situ
after incremental addition of freshly prepared analyte solutions (1
× 10 –2 M, 50 μL addition each time).
