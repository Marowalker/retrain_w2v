Target
deconvolution of phenotypic assays is a hot topic in chemical
biology and drug discovery. The ultimate goal is the identification
of targets for compounds that produce interesting phenotypic readouts.
A variety of experimental and computational strategies have been devised
to aid this process. A widely applied computational approach infers
putative targets of new active molecules on the basis of their chemical
similarity to compounds with activity against known targets. Herein,
we introduce a molecular scaffold-based variant for similarity-based
target deconvolution from chemical cancer cell line screens that were
used as a model system for phenotypic assays. A new scaffold type
was used for substructure-based similarity assessment, termed analog
series-based (ASB) scaffold. Compared with conventional scaffolds
and compound-based similarity calculations, target assignment centered
on ASB scaffolds resulting from screening hits and bioactive reference
compounds restricted the number of target hypotheses in a meaningful
way and lead to a significant enrichment of known cancer targets among
candidates.

1 Introduction
Drug
discovery research is experiencing a renaissance of phenotypic
approaches.1,2 Especially high-content and phenotypic screening
assays have become a hot topic in recent years.3,4 It
is generally thought that phenotypic screens might produce leads that
are more relevant for addressing complex biology in vivo than other
compounds identified in target-based assays. Whether or not such expectations
might generally be true remains to be determined. Be that as it may,
phenotypic discovery is challenged by the need to identify—or
at least narrow down—cellular targets for compounds with interesting
phenotypic readouts, a process often referred to as target deconvolution.5,6 For compound selection and optimization as well as late-stage preclinical
evaluation, target knowledge continues to be required in many cases,
regardless of how candidate compounds have originally been identified.
In addition, there is strong scientific interest in identifying target(s)
whose inhibition in cellular environments might result in interesting
functional effects.

For target deconvolution from phenotypic
screens, different experimental
approaches have been developed or adapted,5−7 including, among
others, various proteomics techniques and the use of small molecular
probes with confirmed activity against selected targets. Moreover,
target identification has also become an attractive task for computational
analysis using different methods. For example, drug-target networks8,9 establish compound-based links between targets and help to better
understand complex interactions involving multiple compounds and targets.
For drugs, new targets can often be proposed on the basis of network
representations that might rationalize side effects.9 Such networks can also be generated for bioactive compounds
other than drugs and can be computationally analyzed. Furthermore,
machine-learning models combining small molecule and target information
(e.g., chemical descriptors and protein sequences) have been generated
to predict novel compound-target pairings.10,11 Moreover, targets of novel active compounds are often inferred from
molecular similarity between these compounds and known actives.12−14 For similarity calculations, a variety of chemical descriptors and
functions exist.15,16 Target hypotheses for new chemical
entities can be derived not only by molecular similarity calculations
producing numerical values but also by assessing substructure relationships
between compounds as a measure of similarity. For example, targets
can be predicted for new active compounds by identifying structural
analogues and comparing their target annotations17 or on the basis of molecular scaffolds,18 which are generated to capture core structures of compounds.19 As such, scaffolds often represent a series
of known active compounds sharing the same core. A systematic scaffold
analysis provides a structural organization scheme, and target annotations
of compounds containing the same scaffold can be assigned to each
scaffold.19 This approach generates activity-annotated
scaffold libraries to which new active compounds without known targets
can be mapped. If scaffolds of new actives match the existing ones,
target hypotheses can be inferred. The classical way of defining scaffolds
for medicinal chemistry applications is according to Bemis and Murcko,
which gave rise to BM scaffolds.20 These
scaffolds are obtained from compounds by the removal of all R-groups
while retaining the ring systems and linker fragments connecting the
rings.20 Various extensions of the BM scaffold
concept such as the Scaffold Tree21 have
been introduced. The Scaffold Tree decomposes BM scaffolds along tree
branches according to chemical rules until only individual rings remain
and thereby establishes structural relationships between the scaffolds.21 Herein, we report the application of a new scaffold
concept termed analog series-based (ASB) scaffold22 to computationally assign potential targets to hits from
cancer cell line screens, which are a major resource for phenotypic
discovery.23

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 ASB Scaffold Concept and
Substructure-Based
Similarity Assessment
Figure 1 compares the generation of ASB and BM scaffolds. Compared
with conventional scaffolds, ASB scaffolds were designed to further
increase the medicinal chemistry relevance by (i) omitting a formal
hierarchical distinction of ring systems, linkers, and substituent;
(ii) representing a series of analogues (rather than individual compounds);
and (iii) incorporating reaction rules.22 The definition of ASB scaffolds is thus more inclusive and restrictive
than compound-based scaffold concepts. From an ASB scaffold, all analogues
of the corresponding series can be regenerated following retrosynthetic
rules. The ASB scaffold contains all substructures that are conserved
within a series and a consensus substitution site where R-groups distinguish
different analogues comprising the series.

Figure 1 Generation of ASB and
BM scaffolds. For a compound series (A–C),
the generation of ASB and BM scaffolds is illustrated. Two unique
BM scaffolds were isolated from these compounds by removing substituents.
RECAP-MMP cores of compounds A–C are shown. The core shared
among all compounds (highlighted in orange) represents the ASB scaffold.

For a substructure-based similarity
assessment, all compounds represented
by the same (BM or ASB) scaffold were assigned to the scaffold and
classified as similar. For a compound-based similarity evaluation,
pairwise Tanimoto coefficient values for the chosen reference (ChEMBL)
and query compounds (from NCI screens) were calculated and a similarity
threshold was applied.

2.2 Analysis Concept and Protocol
A major
goal of our analysis was the evaluation of a new scaffold concept
for the assignment of potential targets to hits from cancer cell line
screens. This setup served as a model system for target deconvolution
from phenotypic assays. The underlying idea was that structurally
very similar active compounds are likely to share targets (which is
well-appreciated in medicinal chemistry). Therefore, analog series
were systematically extracted from combined screening and ChEMBL compounds
to comprehensively capture structural relationships, and the resultant
ASB scaffolds were collected. ASB scaffolds representing both screening
hits and ChEMBL compounds were prioritized, and known target annotations
of ChEMBL compounds were assigned to hits sharing the same ASB scaffold.
Then, target annotations were collected for each cell line. The analysis
was centered on ASB scaffolds to ensure that only close structural
analogues were considered for target transfer from known bioactive
compounds to hits. As such, ASB scaffolds provided a “meta
structure” for target deconvolution. The analysis protocol
that was systematically applied to all 73 cell line screens is illustrated
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Analysis scheme.
For a given cell line, screening compounds (hits,
colored in blue; inactive compounds, pink) and bioactive compounds
from ChEMBL (green) were pooled. From this compound pool, analog series
were extracted (depicted as clusters) and series yielding ASB scaffolds
(orange) identified. ASB scaffolds resulting from series containing
screening hits and ChEMBL compounds (i.e., ASB3 and ASB4) were determined. Target annotations of all bioactive compounds
represented by the shared ASB scaffolds were assembled and the union
of these targets (i.e., T1, T2, and T3) was assigned to screening
hits of this cell line.

The approach is conceptually based on molecular similarity
to derive
compound-target hypotheses, specifically on substructure-based similarity;
that is, compounds are classified as similar if they are represented
by the same scaffold. Accordingly, we have compared ASB scaffolds
and conventional BM scaffolds in the same analysis context and, in
addition, carried out conventional similarity searching as another
reference calculation. In the latter case, screening hits were used
as templates for similarity searching in ChEMBL. If similar compounds
were identified, their target annotations were assigned to the hits.

For our analysis, many properties assigned to scaffolds such as
promiscuity, selectivity, or privileged substructure characteristics
that are often discussed in medicinal chemistry19 are not relevant. Neither do we need to consider relative
contributions of core structures and R-groups to biological activity.
Rather, in the context of our analysis, the use of scaffolds for the
structural organization of active compounds becomes critically important,
which is only one of many aspects often considered in the scaffold-based
analysis of compound activity data.19

2.3 Scaffold and Compound Statistics
Our analysis
protocol identified 99 unique ASB scaffolds shared by
screening hits and ChEMBL compounds, 927 shared BM scaffolds, and
25 390 ChEMBL compounds classified on the basis of similarity
searching as being similar to screening hits (Table 1). Hence, there were many more compound-based
BM than ASB scaffolds and many more similar compounds than scaffolds.
For shared ASB and BM scaffolds, 7–40 and 56–388 scaffolds
were obtained per cell line screen, with a mean of 18.8 and 209.7,
respectively (Table 1). Thus, many scaffolds were detected multiple times in different
cell line screens. In addition, the number of similar compounds per
cell line ranged from 962 to 9465, with a mean of 4883.

statistics for
scaffold analysis and similarity searching. For ASB and BM scaffolds,
ranges (MIN–MAX), averages (AVG), and total numbers (TOTAL)
of scaffolds from screening hits and scaffolds that were shared with
ChEMBL reference compounds, corresponding targets, and cancer targets
are provided across all 73 cell lines. For similarity search calculations,
ranges, averages, and total numbers are reported for similar compounds,
all targets, and cancer targets.

Exemplary shared ASB scaffolds are shown in Figure 3 together with the compound series from which
they originated. These examples illustrate another important aspect
of the ASB scaffold analysis. In these cases, close screening compound
analogues were detected that were either active or inactive in the
cell line screen, thus providing immediate opportunities for reassessing
assay results by retesting selected hits and/or inactive compounds,
prior to the target analysis. In many other instances, shared ASB
scaffolds represented only active compounds, as illustrated in Figure 2.

Examples of shared ASB scaffolds (orange

cancer) cell lines together with corresponding hits (blue box), inactive
compounds (pink), and ChEMBL compounds (green). R-groups distinguishing
these analogs are shown in red.

2.4 Target Assignment
2.4.1 Global
Target Distribution
For
each cell line screen, the union of targets associated with shared
scaffolds was determined. The 927 shared BM scaffolds yielded a total
of 1130 unique targets across all cell lines, with a range of 595
to more than 1000 targets per line, as reported in Table 1. Thus, on the basis of BM scaffolds,
approximately 70% of all investigated human targets were assigned
to screening hits as potential targets. Similarity searching suggested
a larger number of unique 1249 targets of screening hits. However,
when ranges of targets over cell line screens were considered—instead
of total numbers of unique targets—BM scaffold analysis yielded
more targets than similarity searching, with an average 925 versus
756 targets per cell line, respectively (Table 1). Thus, on the basis of compound similarity,
individual targets were much less frequently detected than on the
basis of shared BM scaffolds. For similarity searching, the number
of similar compounds and the resultant targets might be reduced by
further increasing the similarity threshold value. Regardless, the
control calculations showed that generally applied compound similarity
criteria would not be suitable for target assignment across cell line
screens. At face value, implicating approximately 70% or more of all
preselected targets in activity signals from cell line screens—on
the basis of BM scaffolds or compound similarity—was considered
not realistic, despite variations observed across different cell lines.
By contrast, the structurally more conservative ASB scaffold approach
involving multiple compounds significantly reduced the number of target
assignments. On the basis of 99 identified shared ASB scaffolds (approximately
an order of magnitude less than shared BM scaffolds), a total of 232
unique targets were assigned, with a mean of 74 targets per cell line.
Thus, shared ASB scaffolds implicated only approximately 14% of all
targets in cell line screens and also controlled the number of targets
per line.

2.4.2 Cancer Targets
To specifically
focus observed differences in target distributions on the cancer cell
line screening, the assignment of known cancer targets was analyzed,
which represented a subset of all monitored targets. ASB scaffolds,
BM scaffolds, and similarity searching identified 108, 330, and 366
known cancer targets, respectively, as potential targets for screening
hits across all cell lines, with ranges of 14–62 (ASB), 197–303
(BM), and 147–311 (similarity) cancer targets per line (Table 1). With one exception
(macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor; CSF1R; ChEMBL TID
1844), the set of targets identified on the basis of ASB scaffolds
overlapped with the other sets. Table S2 reports the cancer targets assigned on the basis of ASB scaffolds
to each cell line screen.

ASB scaffolds assigned approximately
one-third of cancer targets compared with BM scaffolds and similarity
searching, although the number of all targets differed by more than one order of magnitude. This
corresponded to a significant enrichment of cancer targets among all
assigned targets, as illustrated in Figure 4. Although the application of ASB scaffolds
resulted in comparably low numbers of assigned targets (Figure 4a), the ratio of cancer targets
relative to all targets was higher for ASB than for BM scaffolds and
similarity searching (Figure 4b). Given that absolute target numbers were more realistic
for ASB than BM scaffolds and similarity searching, the observed enrichment
of cancer targets for ASB scaffolds was considered a significant finding.
The corroborating evidence for cancer target assignment was provided
by the frequent occurrence of established cancer targets across different
cell lines, which was clearly evident for ASB scaffolds, given the
reduced “target background”. For example, on the basis
of ASB scaffolds, well-known cancer targets such as P-glycoprotein
1 and tyrosine-protein kinases Fyn and Src were implicated in 73,
62, and 66 cell line screens, respectively. In total, for ASB scaffolds,
46.6% of all assigned targets were cancer targets, with an average
of 36.4% per cell line.

BM scaffolds (cyan),
and similarity searching (SIM, magenta), boxplots report the distribution
of (a) all targets and (b) the percentage of cancer targets for all
73 cell lines. Boxplots show the smallest value (bottom), first quartile

dots).

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have investigated a substructure-based similarity
approach to computationally deconvolute targets from 73 chemical cancer
cell screens used as a model system for phenotypic assays. Assigning
targets on the basis of ligand similarity is a major approach to target
identification in phenotypic discovery. The analysis was focused on
a recently introduced molecular scaffold definition, ASB scaffolds,
designed to further increase the medicinal chemistry relevance of
scaffolds as core structure representations. Calculations on the basis
of conventional BM scaffolds and whole-molecule Tanimoto similarity
served as references. ASB scaffolds are structurally more comprehensive
and conservative than other molecular representations for similarity
assessment, given their default dependence on compound series. As
a consequence, ASB scaffolds produced fewer target hypotheses than
BM scaffolds and similarity searching, thereby counteracting the “target
inflation” observed for ligand similarity-based target prediction.
Moreover, for ASB scaffolds, a significant enrichment of known cancer
targets among candidates assigned to screening hits was observed,
suggesting that the ASB scaffold approach provides a promising addition
to current computational target deconvolution methods.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Scaffolds
Conventional
BM scaffolds
were generated from active compounds by the removal of all R-groups
while retaining ring systems and linker fragments connecting rings.20 Furthermore, new ASB scaffolds22 were isolated from compounds. To generate ASB scaffolds,
analog series were first systematically identified by applying the
matched molecular pair (MMP) approach.24 An MMP is defined as a pair of compounds that are distinguished
only by a chemical change at a single site.24 As such, an MMP consists of a conserved MMP core structure and a
pair of exchanged substituents. MMPs were generated by applying an
algorithm that systematically fragments molecules at exocyclic single
bonds and stores resulting cores and substituent fragments in an index
table from which MMPs are enumerated.25 Retrosynthetic (RECAP) rules26 were applied
to fragment source compounds in which exchanged fragments conform
to chemical reactions (thereby replacing random fragmentation steps),
yielding RECAP-MMPs.27 From all RECAP-MMPs
of active compounds, a network was computed in which nodes represented
compounds and edges pairwise RECAP-MMP relationships.28 In this network, each disjoint cluster contained a unique
series of analogs28 from which ASB scaffolds
were isolated.22 A series of analogs often
yielded multiple MMP cores. Therefore, for each series, a computational
search was carried out for a core that matched all MMP relationships
within the series. If identified, the largest qualifying core then
represented the ASB scaffold of the series.22 The generation of ASB scaffolds is computationally efficient as
it relies on effective MMP enumeration. Therefore, ASB scaffolds can
be generated for large data sets comprising millions of compounds
(such as the entire ChEMBL database).22 The generation of BM and ASB scaffolds is schematically illustrated
in Figure 1. BM scaffolds
were calculated with an in-house implementation using the OpenEye
toolkit.29

4.2 Similarity
Calculations
As a control
for scaffold-based similarity assessment, similarity search calculations
were carried out using the extended connectivity fingerprint with
bond diameter 4 (ECFP4)30 and a similarity
threshold of 0.4 for the Tanimoto coefficient.16 This threshold value is often used for ECFP4 in virtual
compound screening.16

4.3 Cell Lines and Screening Data
The
human tumor cell line growth inhibition assay data from the National
Cancer Institute (NCI)31 were extracted
from PubChem.32 Only compounds screened
in confirmatory assays originating from NCI Developmental Therapeutics
Program (DTP/NCI) were considered. In total, 2 396 398
assay compounds were screened in 73 cell lines representing 10 different
neoplasia (including breast, CNS, colon, leukemia, melanoma, nonsmall
cell lung, ovarian, prostate, and renal cancers). Table 2 reports screening statistics
for each neoplasia type. Details for all cell lines are provided in Table S1. Assay compounds were designated as
active or inactive on the basis of PubChem records. In the following,
active compounds are also referred to as hits.

the 10 neoplasia types and corresponding screening data. For each
neoplasia, the name and number of cell lines are given. In addition,
the total number of assayed compounds (CPDs) and the number of active
and inactive compounds are reported.

4.4 Reference Compounds
For the scaffold-based
similarity analysis, reference compounds were assembled from ChEMBL
version 22.33 Only compounds for which
high-confidence activity data were available were considered. Therefore,
compounds with direct interactions (type “D”) with human
targets at the highest confidence level (ChEMBL confidence score 9)
were selected. Only assay-independent equilibrium constants (Ki values) and assay-dependent IC50 values were considered as potency measurements. Approximate measurements
(e.g., “>” or “∼”) were discarded.
If multiple Ki or IC50 values
were available for the same compound, their geometric mean was calculated
as the final potency annotation, provided all values fell within the
same order of magnitude. Otherwise, the measurements were discarded.
Applying these selection criteria, a total of 224 532 unique
compounds were obtained with activity against human 1687 targets.

4.5 Targets
The set of 1687 ChEMBL targets
(in the following referred to as targets) was used to assign targets
to screening compounds. The subset of known cancer targets was determined.
Therefore, known cancer targets were collected from the Therapeutic
Target Database,34 and targets implicated
in malignant neoplasm were identified on the basis of the ICD-10 code.35 The 1687 ChEMBL targets were found to contain
429 cancer targets.
