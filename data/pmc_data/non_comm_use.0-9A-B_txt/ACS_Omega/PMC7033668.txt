Alternative energy strategies based
on plant biomass-derived bioenergy
and biofuels rely on understanding and optimization of plant structure,
chemistry, and performance. Starch, a constitutive element of all
green plants, is important to food, biofuels, and industrial applications.
Models of carbohydrate storage granules are highly heterogeneous in
representing morphology and structure, though a deeper understanding
of the role of structure in functional behavior is emerging. A better
understanding of the in situ nanoscale properties of native granules
is needed to help improve the starch quality in food crops as well
as optimize lignocellulosic biomass production in perennial nonfood
crops. Here, we present a new technique called soft mechanical nano-ablation
(sMNA) for accessing the interior of the granules without compromising
the inner nanostructure. We then explore the nanomechanics of granules
within the ray parenchyma cells of Populus xylem, a desirable woody biofuel feedstock. The employed soft outer
layer nanoablation and atomic force microscopy reveal that the inner
structure comprises 156 nm blocklets arranged in a semicrystalline
organization. The nanomechanical properties of the inner and outer
structures of a single starch granule are measured and found to exhibit
large variations, changing by a factor of 3 in Young’s modulus
and a factor of 2 in viscoplastic index. These findings demonstrate
how the introduced approach facilitates studies of structure–function
relationships among starch granules and more complex secondary cell
wall features as they relate to plant performance.

Introduction
Plants, through photosynthesis,
produce food in the form of glucose.
The excess glucose is converted to starch (amylose and amylopectin)
and stored for later use by the plant. These food-storage carbohydrates,
occurring as water-insoluble starch granules, are a major food source
and industrial material.1 Much has been
gained in the understanding of the internal structure of the granules
in the past 5 decades of starch science2−4 with the advent of X-ray
diffraction,5,6 transmission electron microscopy,7 scanning electron microscopy (SEM),8,9 and atomic force microscopy (AFM).10,11 To characterize
the inner structure of the granules, the outer layer of the starch
is either digested or exploded using biological or chemical processes
such as enzymatic hydrolysis,8 lintnerization
(mild acid hydrolysis),10 dry powder partially
affixed with cyanoacrylate,11,12 or acid treatment.9 These techniques, in conjunction with SEM or
AFM, have provided valuable information, but require massive degradation
of the granules in order to access their inner structures, thus altering
their physical properties. As a less destructive alternative, the
probe tip of an AFM has been used as a mechanical “plow”
to abrase thin layers of the granule surface; however, individual
structures have not been observed at the abrasion sites.13,14

In the present work, we introduce an AFM-based soft mechanical
nanoablation technique, which we abbreviate as sMNA. We show that
sMNA allows the observation of the interior of the granules. Similar
to material removal using laser ablation, here, employing sMNA, localized
tip indentations are executed to precisely uncouple and displace the
outer layer of the granule, leaving the inner architecture intact
for further metrology. With the outer layer removed, we carry out
nanomechanical measurements and characterization of the exposed inner
layer, which, to our knowledge, have not been reported previously.
Specifically, we apply the minimally destructive sMNA to in situ native
starch granules of Populus and correlate
the results with those of starch chemistry and architecture obtained
from confocal Raman microscopy and SEM, respectively. Via the minimally
destructive sMNA, allowing the gentle removal of the outer material,
we identify and obtain evidence of highly ordered blocklets. Acquisition
and analysis of nanomechanical forces, presented for both outer and
inner regions of the granule, reveal a large difference in the extracted
Young’s moduli and viscoplasticities.

Macromolecules,
that is, very large molecules formed by polymerization
of smaller molecules or monomers, can be branched and thus have side
chains or branches growing from the main chain. It is known that starch
granules are highly complex macromolecular assemblies of two carbohydrate
macromolecules (polysaccharides), amylose and amylopectin.15 Although chemically not complex, the architecture
of the storage polysaccharide is a complex accumulation of d-anhydroglucose units linked by α-1-4 and α-1-6 glycosidic
bonds. Amylopectin, a major constituent comprising 75–90% of
the bulk, is a highly branched macromolecule containing α-1-4
linkages and α-1-6 branches (about 5%).16 The clustered organization of packed glucan side chains through
the α-1-6 glycosidic linkage is responsible for the partial
crystalline nature of amylopectin.8 Amylose
is a smaller macromolecule of α-1-4 linked chains with very
few branches (<1%) that tends to be tightly helical.16 The model of the starch structure is still ambiguous;
however, it is generally accepted that the branching and layout of
amylopectin is not random.1 For example,
X-ray scattering has shown that clusters of individual amylopectin
molecules and their side-chains stack in conservation, the cluster
units having a periodicity of 9–10 nm regardless of plant species.2 Upon partial digestion by α-amylase enzymes
during acid hydrolysis, such starch granules are observed to be composed
of growth rings (or shells) of alternating amorphous and semicrystalline
layers, with the surviving more resistant semicrystalline layers being
120–400 nm thick.8,17 Additionally, spherical
“blocklets” between 20 and 500 nm have been observed
in the semicrystalline layers,8 which might
be explained as a amylopectin super-helix.18 The blocklets are composed of alternating amorphous and crystalline
“lamellae” of pitch 9–10 nm relating to the amylopectin
side-chain clusters.2 Thus, whereas structural
features such as granules, growth layers (shells), blocklets, and
lamellae (clusters) have been identified, the starch structure continues
to be a topic of research because of a lack of a universally accepted
model. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that the molecular structure
and amylose/amylopectin ratio are profoundly related to the functional
starch properties of morphology (granular size and shape), gelatinization
and retrogradation, solubility, digestibility, thermal properties,
and paste properties.19

To what extent
the variations in structure play a role in the plant
characteristics is not yet a mature subject, with open questions such
as the interdependencies between the formation of starch and biosynthetic
enzymes,1 the role of starch architecture
in plant physiology and starch metabolism,20 how the structure of granules influences starch functionality in
foods and nutrition,21 and the potential
use of starch nanoelements for biocomposites.22 Moreover, understanding the role of seasonal variation in starch
granules in woody perennial plants and correlation to annual biomass
productivity23,24 is critical to the development
of sustainable biofuel crops1 that are
with optimized resource capture, allocation, storage, and utilization.
Starch granule formation and metabolism in ray cells are relevant
to wood formation, stem growth, and productivity in that those processes
impact cambial dormancy and reactivation, which are key to adaptation
of plants to such seasonal variations.25−27

Given the apparent
regularity of the side-chain amylopectin cluster
size,2 the size and structure of starch
granules vary greatly with plant group; additional research is needed
to capture the nanoscale variability between and within individual
species. Whether or not connections can be made between the starch
structures of woody feedstock, the physical and physiological processes
in biomass plant tissues and cells, and the challenges of ethanol
production have yet to be explored. Populus, being a nonfood source and one of the fastest growing trees in
the temperate latitudes, is a promising feedstock for biofuels.28 Whereas associations between Populus starch accumulation and the genotype are
being observed when studying the response to abiotic factors, such
as drought stressors,23,24 the role of starch structure
is unknown and in need of investigation (see section S5 in the Supporting Information for more discussion).

Results
and Discussions
Dimensional Quantification of in Situ Starch
Granules
Electron microscopy of the prepared plant materials
proves a useful
initial approach to nanometrology, as shown in Figure 1. Studying the images acquired for a stem
xylem structure, we observed certain morphological features agglomerated
on or near specific surface regions of the investigated cross sections.
Upon closer inspection, the features may be identified to be starch
granules,29 which are observed to be mainly
localized within the ray parenchyma (RP) cells of the stem sample.
One of the functions of the RP includes the storage and transport
of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs).

Figure 1 SEM of starch granules
(purple) in untreated Populus within
xylem region of the stem sample. Color was artificially assigned
to better visualize the structures. (a) Accumulation in ray RP cells
with simple (unbordered) pits (red arrows). (b) Substructures of ∼100–250
nm (inside the dashed yellow lines regions) are revealed within the
granules as dark speckles, possibly surface pores, or blocklets. A
yellow circle of 150 nm diameter marks one of the dark regions.

Depending on the location of the cross-sectional
cut of the sample,
the contents of RP cells may be only partially exposed (see Figures
S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). The external morphology of the starch granules takes polygonal
shapes of irregular size, shape, and number of facets. Analyzing the
SEM images of granules from several RP cells, we have evaluated their
dimensions by measuring the perimeter of their projected top facet,
assuming an elliptic shape. With an average top facet circularity
of 0.70 and perimeter of 4.7 ± 0.9 μm, the average diameter
is determined to be 1.5 ± 0.3 μm and the volume 1.75 ±
0.03 μm3 (see Figure S3 in Supporting Information). The diameter can range from less than 1 to 300
μm depending on the plant source, making Populus starch granules one of the smallest. In contrast to the observed
fairly uniform granule size, other granules (e.g., Norway spruce needles,
Wheat) have a wide ranging size, from 0.5 to 10 μm in diameter.13,14,30

Round substructures can
be observed through the partially transparent
outer surface (yellow dashed region in Figure 1b), with diameters of 100–250 nm.
The surface of the granule appears to be smooth with the dark speckles
residing under a thin layer. The distribution and size variation are
suggestive of evidence of surface pores31 or of blocklets.8 Furthermore, the observed
holes in the ray cell walls are identified to be pits, with nearly
round diameters of around 1 μm. Whereas bordered pits are found
in numerous species of woody dicotyledons, the pits in our sample
appear to be simple and nonbordered.

Chemical Signature of in
Situ Starch Granules
Multimodal
and correlative imaging and analysis of subcellular features and complex
systems, such as starch granules in woody xylem, are highly needed
measurement capabilities. Specifically, further studies by overlaying
the observed SEM-derived morphological features in Figure 1 with chemical information,
such as obtained from Raman spectroscopy,32 may prove useful. For example, principal component analysis of the
Raman spectra is a promising technique for quantifying amylose content.33,34 Similarly, employing confocal Raman microscopy, the characteristic
spectral features of major polymers of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose
have been shown to be sufficient in recognizing specific domains and
compositions34 of plant cell walls. Therefore,
here, we carry out Raman spectroscopy of a 20 μm thick cross
section of untreated raw stem to generate the needed spectral images.
As shown in Figure 2a, the processed Raman map reveals ∼2 μm diameter granules
(purple) in the RP with distinct red lignin-rich (lr), light blue
cellulose-rich (cr), and yellow ligno-cellulosic (lc) regions characteristic
of cross-sectional wood cells. A green region of low-signal (ls) is
due to the receding sample surface becoming out of focus with the
instrument.

Figure 2 Confocal Raman microscopy of untreated raw Populus. (a) Chemical identification of native starch (purple) is distinct
from cr (light-blue), lc (yellow), and lignin-rich (red) areas. A
yellow circle of 2 μm diameter is positioned over a granule.
(b) Average Raman signal for each cluster partition, offset in the y-axis for clarity. The lr partition is distinguished by
the 1670 cm –1 line, and the cr partition by the
2900 cm–1 line. The lc partitions contain both lines,
whereas ns is distinguished by the line at 482 cm–1.

The corresponding average spectra
for each cluster (Figure 2b) show lignin-rich regions
with the characteristic 1467 cm–1 (C=C stretching),
whereas cr regions are indicated by the peak at 2900 cm–1 (C–H stretching). The lc (yellow) regions contain both characteristic
peaks at 1673 and 2900 cm–1, however not as strong.
The Raman peaks of the purple native-starch (ns) cluster indicate
that the composition is neither lignin nor cellulose, having no major
peak at 1467 cm–1 or at 2900 cm–1. The new band 482 cm–1, seen in the skeletal-mode
region, is an indicator of starch. The C–H stretching region,
3100–2900 cm–1, is not expected to be dramatically
different between starch and the constituents of the cell wall. The
spectra are also compared to those of storage polysaccharides (starch
or polymeric carbohydrate molecules) extracted from potato and ergosterol
(sterol from cell membranes of fungi and protozoa). The strong peaks
of the purple cluster at 2913 and 482 cm–1 fairly
matched the potato starch at 2933 and 482 cm–1 (see
Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The lines relevant to carbohydrate are well-known.32,33,35 A further analysis of the native
starch spectra is shown in starch spectra shown in Figure 3 with major band assignments
listed in Table 1.
The α-1-6 linkage of the amylopectin chain is identified at
943 cm–1. We also found peaks at 1467, 1385, 1339,
1269 cm–1, glycosidic links (1129 and 1099 cm–1), and 873 cm–1 with shoulders at
1146, 1052, and 904 cm–1. Additionally, ring modes
(722, 772 cm–1) and the skeletal modes (380, 444,
482, 523, and 582 cm–1 with shoulders at 314 and
610 cm–1) were present. For our species of Populus, the observed starch marker peak at 482 cm–1 falls within the 475–485 cm–1 marker range for starch.

Physical Properties
of in Situ Starch Granules
Having
identified the chemical composition of the observed granular features,
we then examine their individual morphological and mechanical properties
using AFM in imaging and force measurement modes. As force mapping
is highly dependent on the AFM tip environment (contact surface),
granules are chosen with a flat top facet. To locate and select the
granules, we first acquired large-scale topographic images (Figure 4a). We then employed
sMNA to carve out a segment of the surface and mechanically expose
the interior of the granule (see Experimental section). In contrast to other cited methods, the sMNA does not alter the
integrity of the sample. Quantitative analyses were obtained on three
different granules from the same untreated Populus cross section.

Nanoablation for Morphological Investigation
Ablating
∼300 nm of the top surface (Figure 4c) was sufficient to remove the outer layer
and to expose the inner structure of a single granule. The higher-resolution
topographic measurements confirmed the presence of highly ordered
substructures (Figure 4d). By analyzing the cross-sectional profiles (red dotted curves
in Figure 4b), taken
at the dotted lines in Figure 4d, a highly ordered, close-packed structure is revealed and
interpreted to be blocklets. The surface roughness extracted from
topographic images was found to be ∼3 nm before ablation, shown
as the blue curve in Figure 4b. After ablation, the height of the cross-sectional surface
profiles at the red dotted curves were measured to be ∼30 nm,
neglecting the two large bumps considered to be debris from the ablation.
The high periodicity in both profiles confirms blocklet substructure
with dimensions of 160 ± 30 and 200 ± 30 nm, respectively
(Figure 4b), in agreement
with the reported range.8 We survey the
closed-packed arrangement by outlining the edges of the topography,
indicating a diamond-shaped packing of blocklets, as seen from the
top surface side of the inner layer (Figure 4e). In observing the orthogonal orientation
or cross section of the growth layer in the phase image in Figure 4f, the patterns in
the region demarcated with a black dashed line suggest a thickness
of a single blocklet to be ∼150 nm, indicated by the green
bar. Using a diameter of an amylopectin side-chain cluster of 9–10
nm and an average blocklet length of 150 nm, the blocklets are estimated
to contain 15–17 lamellae. Note that ring growths8,17 composed of alternating amorphous and semicrystalline layers were
not observed. The growth ring model is mainly used to describe large
starch granules (above 10 μm) and does not apply to the 1 μm-size Populus starch granules. Instead, our result suggests
a core–shell structure made of one ∼300 nm-size amorphous
outer layer and one ∼150 nm-size blocklet layer (see section
S4 in the Supporting Information).

An advantage of using the sMNA for the study of starch architecture
is the capability of obtaining highly controlled multiple views of
the starch structure. As a demonstration, two ablated areas (blue
and red) from two different granules are imaged showing the blocklet
substructure (Figure 4g). Even at a low resolution, the numerical (150 × 100 pixel2) zoom of the blue region (Figure 4h) indicates an organized substructure.38 The spatial frequency of the topographical features
is quantified from the (512 × 256 pixel2) zoomed (1
× 0.5 μm2) image (Figure 4i) of the red region in Figure 4g. From the associated Fourier
power spectral density, the periodicity of the observed nanostructures
is determined to be 156 nm, in agreement with the profile measurement.

Nanoablation for Nanomechanical Investigation of in Situ Starch
Granules
Nanomechanical properties, expressed in terms of
Young’s modulus (E) and viscoplasticity index
(PI)34 of the starch granules, may shed
further light onto the granule structure; however, few studies have
been conducted mainly because of the lack of accessibility to the
inner structure. Such information can be extracted from nanoindentation
by a sharp AFM tip34 into the granule and
its substructures. Force mapping was thus performed on both the outer
surface and the inner ablated surface exposing the substructure. Figure 5 displays both the
topographic and the mechanical properties extracted before (Figure 5a,b,e,f,i,j,m,n)
and after (Figure 5c,d,g,h,k,l,o,p) granule ablation. Topographical imaging of the outer
surface (Figure 5a)
is zoomed in to show nanometer-scale roughness (Figure 5b), with additional detail in the corresponding
phase images (Figure 5e,f). The topography of the inner surface (Figure 5c,d) is supported with corresponding phase
images that have strong features of the exposed substructures (Figure 5g,h). E mappings of the surfaces (Figure 5i,k) located by the marked yellow regions (Figure 5a,c) were extracted
from force–deformation curves measured during the tip–sample
interaction during indention (see Experimental section). Young’s modulus distributions, extracted from E mapping, illustrated as histograms in Figure 5j,l, were computed to determine the average E values for each case. The outer surface has a predominantly
homogeneous E with an average value of 10.8 ±
2.4 GPa (Figure 5i).
The inner exposed region, appearing in brown (Figure 5k), shows a large increase of E of 31.7 ± 9.9 GPa, reflecting the nanolayer-dependent mechanical
property differences of the granule. The difference in E may be suggestive of differences in the physical properties (e.g.,
density) of the amorphous top and semicrystalline inner layers.1

Figure 5 Mechanical properties of starch granules through nanomechanical
force measurements on a single granule. A comparison between the unablated
outer surface (a,b,e,f,i,j,m,n) and the region of the inner surface
after ablation (c,d,g,h,k,l,o,p) reveals differences in topography, E and, PI. In (a,c), the yellow squares on the topographical
images mark the zoomed regions in the outer surface (b,f,i,j,m,n)
and inner surface (d,h,k,l,o,p), respectively. The phase images (e–h)
provide additional detail to the topographical images (a–d),
where greater roughness is observed in the inner surface (h). The E mapping and the resulting distribution histogram of the
inner surface, (k,l), respectively, is a factor of 3 larger than the
outer surface, (i,j), respectively. The PI mapping and resulting distribution
histogram of the inner surface (o,p), respectively, is a factor of
2 larger than the outer surface (m,n), respectively.

The exposed inner blocklet regions are expected to be semicrystalline,
containing a higher ratio of amylopectin (a large macromolecule of
107 to 109 Da molecular weight with a density
of 1.5 g/cm), whereas the outer shell may be amorphous, composed of
more amylose (molecular weight 105 to 106 Da).
In addition, the blue-green zones surrounding the exposed region in
the E image (Figure 5k) can be associated with the outer surface and cell
wall materials. This change in mechanical properties over the exposed
area is also manifested in the phase imaging (Figure 5h), which is highly sensitive to viscoelasticity.39 Changes in adhesion energy, which could also
contribute to the change in the phase was shown to be negligible (see
Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). PI is an informative mechanical property that reflects the ratio
of elastic and viscoplastic deformations sustained by the granule
surface during the indentation measurements (Figure 5m–p). When PI equals 1, the material
behavior is fully viscoplastic, whereas for a PI equals 0, it is fully
elastic. Figure 5o
shows an increase of PI from 0.4 to 0.8 after granule ablation, implying
an increase of the viscoplasticity. Previous work using contact AFM
abrasion on unmodified wheat starch granules showed an increase in
the hardness by a factor of 4 before and after abrasion of the surrounding
gluten (protein) layer.13,14 However, in this work,
the blocklet structure was not distinguished, thus a direct comparison
cannot be made.

Conclusions
From the analysis of
the in situ images, the observed granular
features, resolved by electron microscopy, were measured to be 1.5
± 0.3 μm in size. The results from confocal Raman microscopy
showed that the observed features emit strong Raman radiation at 943
cm–1 because of the amylopectin chain of the starch.
From further morphological investigation using AFM, we confirmed that
the features, predominantly found in the ray RP cells, were starch
granules of young untreated woody xylem. It can therefore be concluded
that the molecular composition of the granules includes amylose and
amylopectin. The application of sMNA to the granule outer layer was
effective in precisely controlling mechanical exposure of the inner
layer without chemically treating or altering the sample, thus allowing
subsequent topographic analysis to reveal highly ordered blocklets
of ∼160 nm size. This new experimental evidence confirms that Populus starch granules possess nanometer-sized blocklets,
a potential biofuel feedstock. The previously reported formation layers
or growth rings, found inside large granules,8,9,15 were not observed in our samples, mainly
because of their small size (around 1.5 μm in diameter), but
a core–shell model structure is suggested. In addition, the
self-assembling of the blocklets was confirmed via Fourier image processing,
resulting in a periodicity of 156 nm and indicating that the ordered
inner structure is semicrystalline.

The sMNA facilitated the
observation of the remarkable topographical
detail of the semicrystalline blocklet structure, not seen previously
via other techniques. Furthermore, the quantitative mechanical measurements
provided information on the Young’s modulus and viscoplastic
index heterogeneity of the material at a nanoscale level, distinguishing
the inner and outer granule regions. We report a Young’s modulus
of 10.8 ± 2.4 GPa for the outer layer and three times larger
for the blocklet substructures, that is, E = 31.7
± 9.9 GPa. These differences could be due to the different distributions
of amylose and amylopectin, which have different densities. Importantly,
we found a much higher viscoplastic behavior for the internal layer,
providing new information on the starch granule structure. The demonstrated
ablation technique was proposed here as an integral part of a multimodal
nanoscale approach to achieving soft alteration of core–shell
materials with weak interlayer coupling without damaging the nanostructures
inside the granule. The presented results demonstrate a powerful application
of multimodal AFM for quantitative in situ determination of the properties
of a specific plant substructure here, starch granule, opening up
its potential to clarify more complex secondary cell wall features.
Application of this technique in the future to study starch granules
under biotic or abiotic stresses can aid in mechanistic understanding
of the relevance of genetically determined factors and external signals
in defining plant productivity and health.23−27,40

Experimental Section
Sample
Preparation
The samples of fresh Populus were harvested from stems of greenhouse-grown
plants rapidly growing Populus tremula × alba (clone 717) wild-type
plants, noting that starch granules are produced within the RP40 in spring and summer in field-growing plants.27 Though there is a small effect because of temperature
and light quality throughout the year, our greenhouse conditions remained
within the ambient range. Thus, greenhouse-grown plants, unlike field-grown
plants, do not necessarily synthesize, store, and mobile starch according
to seasons. The samples did not undergo fixation,
infiltration, staining, and processing steps but the sectioned samples
were still minimally processed. Freshly harvested stem samples were
embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek), quickly flash-frozen,
and sectioned immediately with a cryomicrotome (Leica Cryostat) using
a disposable blade to obtain 15 μm thick sections. To maintain
structural integrity of the cell walls, all samples were stored and
dried between glass slides. Initially, the freshly cut cross sections
were washed with DI water and some were set aside as UR (untreated
raw) samples.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
SEM
measurements were
performed using JEOL JSM-6340F equipment, at an acceleration voltage
of 3 kV. To get a better contrast with the SEM, the samples were slightly
coated with carbon using a 99.9% pure graphite source. This process
typically results in a few tens of nanometers (∼20 nm) sputtered
on the sample. The AFM images were not acquired from the coated samples.

Extraction of Granule Dimensions
Granule dimensions
were extracted from SEM images using ImageJ software. Because granules
have polygonal shapes of irregular facet numbers and dimensions, and
we have access to two-dimensional projections only, volume dimensions
cannot be determined accurately. Dimensions reported in the paper
have been approximated by measuring the perimeter of the top facet
of each granule and assuming an ellipsoid shape (see Figures S1–S3
in the Supporting Information).

Raman
Confocal Microscopy
Confocal Raman images of
the samples were acquired with a WITec Alpha500R near field scanning
optical microscope at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Raman spectra
was taken at a resolution of 4 cm–1. A 100×
objective provided ∼320 nm spatial resolution. Images were
obtained by raster scanning at a 200 nm step size and 0.5 s integration
time. K-means cluster analysis was used to create
Raman cluster images.

Atomic Force Microscopy
AFM and
spectroscopy were used
to extract topographic information and mechanical properties at the
nanoscale for starch granules. All measurements were obtained using
the NTEGRA AFM system from NT-MDT and AFM tips from Mikromash (NSC15,
resonance frequency f ≈ 150 kHz, apex radius r = 8 nm, spring constant in the range 30–35 N/m).
Note that prior to and after each measurement, the spring constant
was calibrated using the thermal noise method and measuring the cantilever
sensitivity by pressing the tip over a hard glass substrate. Mapping
of the Young’s modulus was extracted from the beginning of
unloading curves of discrete force curve measurements realized at
each point of a 120 × 120 array by using the Sneddon contact
mechanics, assuming a conical tip in contact with a flat surface.41 In all cases, the adhesion was found to be generally
smaller than 10% of the applied loading force and was considered negligible
in the model. Curves were obtained at a frequency of 1 Hz. Poisson
ratio was 0.4 for the sample.42 The viscoplasticity
index was obtained following the method reported in43,44 by considering the ratio of the areas below the loading and unloading
curves of the force measurements. A plasticity index of PI = 1 yields
a fully plastic material, whereas PI = 0 corresponds to a perfectly
elastic response. For E and PI mappings of (Figure 5i), an array of 40
× 40 discrete curves, covering a 1 × 1 μm2 region, was performed, whereas a 120 × 120 array was used in
(Figure 5k), covering
a 3 × 3 μm2 region.

Nanoablation Using AFM
We have developed a mechanical
nanoablation technique, named in analogy with laser ablation, in order
to separate the different layers of the core–shell starch granule.
Similar to indentation mapping, the AFM tip is used as a nanocutter.
The ablation is carried out by scanning the sample with the probe
with a force sufficiently high to cut the nonconnected shell layer
of the granule. In our experiment, a force of about 1.5 μN was
required to uncouple both layers. We note from Figure 5 that only the shell layer is affected by
the ablation, where the surrounding cell walls are unmodified.
