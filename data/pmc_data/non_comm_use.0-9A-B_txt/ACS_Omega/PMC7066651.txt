Selegiline,
an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B, is prescribed
during the early stages of Parkinson’s disease. The nutritional
herbal medicine Panax ginseng C.A.
Meyer has been reported to show potential neuroprotective activity;
however, the herb–drug pharmacokinetic interaction between
selegiline and P. ginseng extract has
not been characterized. Our hypothesis is that the ginseng extract
and selegiline produce pharmacokinetic interactions at certain doses.
To investigate this hypothesis, a validated ultraperformance liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS)
method was developed to monitor selegiline in rat plasma. Experimental
rats were divided into groups treated with selegiline alone (10 mg/kg,
i.v.; 30 mg/kg, p.o.), with the low-dose ginseng extract (1 g/kg,
p.o., for 5 consecutive days) or with the high-dose ginseng extract
(3 g/kg, p.o., for 5 consecutive days). The pharmacokinetic results
demonstrated that the oral bioavailability of selegiline alone was
approximately 18%; however, when rats were pretreated with low and
high doses of the ginseng extract, the bioavailability of selegiline
was 7.2 and 29%, respectively. These results suggested that the ginseng
extract may produce a biphasic pharmacokinetic phenomenon. In summary,
ginseng alters the oral bioavailability of selegiline, and these observations
might provide preclinical information concerning the pharmacokinetic
interactions between selegiline and herbal supplements.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Selegiline [l-(−)-deprenyl;
(−)-R-N,α-dimethoxy-N-2-propynyl-phenethylamine
hydrochloride], an irreversible monoamine oxidase subtype B (MAO-B)
inhibitor,1 has been used as a monotherapy
for the early treatment of Parkinson’s disease.2 Although levodopa is the standard drug for managing Parkinson’s
disease, several side effects, including dyskinesia, hallucinations,3 hypotension, and sleep disorders, have been observed.4 The combination of levodopa with selegiline has
been applied in the treatment of the advanced course of this disease
to delay the need for levodopa therapy and decrease the dose frequency
of levodopa required.5 MAO-I inhibitors
are effective for treating psychiatric disorders, especially depressive
disorders,6 because they inhibit the degradation
by monoamine oxidase of transmitter amines, including dopamine, serotonin,
epinephrine, and norepinephrine.7 Selegiline
is readily absorbed because of its lipophilic and slightly basic features
and is rapidly metabolized in humans through the liver cytochrome
P450 system. Then, selegiline is converted to l-methamphetamine,
of which l-amphetamine is a secondary metabolite that is
excreted as l-desmethyl-selegiline in urine.8

Panax ginseng C.A.
Meyer is used
widely as a supplement around the world and is one of the 40 top-selling
herbal supplements in the United States, with approximately 9.7 million
dollars in market sales, because of its restorative and tonic actions.9 Several healing effects of ginseng, including
hepatoprotective,10 aging prevention,11 immune system and central nervous system effects,
have been shown since the 1950s. Owing to the prevalent usage of herbal
remedies in Europe, China, the United States, and Taiwan,12 patients are likely to receive concurrent herbal
and standard drug medications. Ginsenosides were reported to possess
potential neuroprotective activity related to Parkinson’s disease;
it was demonstrated that the bioactive compounds in ginseng have protective
effects against MPP(+)-induced Parkinsonian syndrome and
prevent neuroinflammation to protect dopaminergic cells from oxidative
stress and to maintain dopamine levels in the brain.13P. ginseng C.A. Meyer was
shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of certain prescription medications
through cytochrome P450 enzymes.14 Thus,
it is important to evaluate the pharmacokinetic interactions between P. ginseng extract and selegiline.

There are
few reports in PubMed of analytical methods for the determination
of selegiline.15,16 Some reports were based on liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) using positive
electrospray ionization but did not provide LC chromatograms or mass
spectra,17 whereas other studies evaluated
selegiline and its metabolites in urine with SPE.18 Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)
is valuable because it is sensitive, rapid, and selective; however,
few bioanalytical methods with this technique have been developed.18

Because nutritional supplements derived
from ginseng extract possess
potential neuroprotective activity and as selegiline is used to reduce
symptoms in the early stage of Parkinson’s disease, it is possible
that ginseng and selegiline could be used together in therapies. Our
hypothesis is that ginseng extract and selegiline may interact via
specific pharmacokinetic mechanisms. To investigate this hypothesis,
a validated method for monitoring selegiline in rat plasma with ultraperformance
liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS)
was developed, and the preclinical pharmacokinetic interaction of
ginseng extract and selegiline was examined in this study.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optimization of UPLC–MS/MS
Conditions
A Waters Acquity UPLC system coupled with a Waters
Xevo tandem
quadrupole mass spectrometer with a positive ionization electrospray
interface were used to generate the product ion transitions. Optimization
was achieved with the software IntelliStart (Waters Acquity UPLC system
in MassLynx 4.1) and was modified by testing the cone voltage over
a range of 12–20 V. A cone voltage of 14 V produced the best
fragmentation for both selegiline and the noscapine internal standard
(IS). The monitored ion transitions were m/z 188.2 and 118.98 for selegiline and m/z 414.29 and 220.11 for noscapine (IS), and the
mass spectra are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Mass spectra of (A) selegiline at m/z 188.12 → 118.98 and (B) noscapine (IS) at m/z 414.29 → 220.11.

The analytes were separated on a C18 reverse-phase
column
(100 mm × 2.1 mm); the retention time of selegiline was 2.7 min,
and the retention time of noscapine was 2.38 min. Mobile phases of
0.1% formic acid, 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 10 mM ammonium acetate,
and 10 mM ammonium formate were tested. The mobile phase of 10 mM
ammonium formate resulted in the most intense chromatographic peaks
and was therefore selected as the mobile phase. To eliminate the interfering
peak from blank plasma, methanol was added to the mobile phase, for
a final mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium formate/methanol (20:80 v/v).
The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min, the injection volume was 10 μL,
and the total run time was 4 min. The chromatographic conditions resulted
in high sensitivity and peak intensity, and the peak shape is shown
in Figure 2.

MRM chromatograms of blank plasma without selegiline
and noscapine (IS), (B) blank plasma spiked with selegiline (100 ng/mL)
and (C) a plasma sample containing selegiline (99.55 ng/mL) collected
at 15 min after administration of selegiline (30 mg/kg, p.o.) with P. ginseng (3 g/kg, p.o., daily for 5 days); peak
1: noscapine (IS); peak 2: selegiline.

2.2 Optimization of UPLC–MS/MS Conditions
The linear range for selegiline was 5–500 ng/mL, and the
calibration curve was described by y = 0.0085x – 0.0214, with good linearity (r2 > 0.999). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ)
was
5 ng/mL with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) > 3. The matrix effect
and recovery in rat plasma were estimated at low (5 ng/mL), medium
(50 ng/mL), and high (500 ng/mL) concentrations and ranged from 83.4
to 90.9 and 97.1 to 105.85%, respectively (Table 1). The evaluation of the matrix effect (set
2/set 1) indicated that the plasma-based interferences and UPLC–MS/MS
interferences were low and acceptable. The high reproducibility of
the recovery demonstrated that protein precipitation was a reliable
approach for sample preparation and that the IS was suitable for use
in this analysis method.

The precision (% RSD) and accuracy

intraday and interday assays, which were conducted by spiking blank
plasma with selegiline at concentrations of 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500
ng/mL. The precision and accuracy are summarized in Table 2. The intraday precision ranged
from 1.99 to 5.72%, with an accuracy of −6.76 to 10.37%, whereas
the interday precision ranged from 0.26 to 13.95%, with an accuracy
of −4.05 to 20.17%. The mean bias (%) and RSD (%) for selegiline
in rat plasma varied within ±15%, but the LLOQ varied within
±20%, which was still acceptable according to the US Food and
Drug Administration (US FDA) bioanalytical method validation guidelines.
All the validation parameters demonstrated that replicate measurements
were dependent on the quantification of selegiline in the rat plasma
samples.

2.3 Stability
The
stability of the analyte
at low, medium, and high concentrations (5 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, and 500
ng/mL) was examined in triplicate after exposure to different conditions,
including autosampler handling, short-term storage, long-term storage,
and freeze–thaw cycles, as shown in Table 3. No significant degradation of selegiline
was observed in the autosampler or during short-term or long-term
storage conditions, but degradation was observed under freeze–thaw
cycle conditions. Repeated freezing and thawing should be avoided
during sample preparation of selegiline and similar analytes.

2.4 Pharmacokinetic Evaluation
The pharmacokinetic
herb–drug interaction of P. ginseng C.A. Meyer with selegiline following intravenous administration
of one dose (10 mg/kg) of selegiline or following oral administration
of one dose (30 mg/kg) of selegiline coadministered either with two
doses of P. ginseng C.A. Meyer extract
(1 and 3 g/kg for 5 consecutive days) or without ginseng extract was
used to calculate the bioavailability of selegiline.

The mean
concentration in rat plasma over time after the administration of
selegiline is provided in Figure 3. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 123.2 ng/mL in the selegiline-only group and
141.8 and 108.6 ng/mL in the coadministered ginseng extract group
(1 and 3 g/kg/day, respectively; Table 4). There was no significant difference in Cmax between the oral administration groups. The time required
to reach Cmax (Tmax) was 5 min, indicating that selegiline was rapidly metabolized
in the rats, similar to its metabolism in humans. The area under the
curve (AUC) for the concentration–time relationship was 2.52
and 10.22 μg/mL for the coadministration group (1 and 3 g/kg/day,
respectively) and 5.45 μg/mL for the selegiline-only group;
the selegiline-only value was intermediate between the values for
the coadministration groups. The clearance (CL) in the coadministration
group was opposite that in the selegiline-only group. The CL was lower
in the 3 g/kg/day ginseng coadministration group (3.72 L/min/kg) than
in the 1 g/kg/day ginseng group (12.47 L/min/kg). As a result, the
AUC was higher in the 3 g/kg/day ginseng group than in the 1 g/kg/day
ginseng group. After pretreatment with ginseng extract at 3 g/kg,
a decreased CL rate, an increased half-life (t1/2), and an increased mean residence time (MRT) were observed;
however, the group coadministered 1 g/kg ginseng extract appeared
to show stable trends characterized by significant decreases in the
above parameters.

groups
were treated with selegiline (30 mg/kg, p.o.) alone, with P. ginseng (3 g/kg, p.o., for 5 consecutive days)
and selegiline (30 mg/kg, p.o.), or with P. ginseng (1 g/kg, p.o., for 5 consecutive days) and selegiline (10 mg/kg,
i.v.).

We investigated the major metabolic pathways of selegiline
and
the effects of P. ginseng extracts
on CYP450 in rats and humans in a previously published paper.19,20 Cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6, participate
in the metabolism of selegiline, which forms desmethyl-selegiline
and l-methamphetamine. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved
in two major oxidative pathways, whereas CYP1A2 participates in the
formation of desmethyl-selegiline only.21 CYP2B6 showed higher affinity for the metabolism of selegiline than
CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in humans.22 However,
the amount and activity of CYP450 in different species should be taken
into consideration. In rats, the majority of the drug-metabolizing
CYP family involved in selegiline metabolism consists of CYP1A2 (major)
and CYP3A4 (minor), as explained in Figure 4.23 Alteration
of the activity of CYP450 by P. ginseng in rats was observed in other research, suggesting that P. ginseng significantly enhanced the activity of
CYP1A2 but reduced the activity of CYP3A isoforms, which may be consistent
with our findings about the pharmacokinetic herb–drug interaction
of P. ginseng and selegiline.24 In the low-dosage (1 g/kg/day) ginseng group,
which showed increased CYP1A2 activity, selegiline degradation resulted
in the formation of desmethyl-selegiline. However, the high-dosage
(3 g/kg/day) ginseng group showed inhibition of CYP3A4 in two major
oxidative pathways, which prevented selegiline degradation.

Figure 4 Majority of
the drug-metabolizing CYP family involved in the metabolism
of selegiline consists of the human CYP2B6 and rat CYP3A4 and CYP1A2
enzymes.

3 Conclusions
A validated UPLC–MS/MS analytical method was established
for quantifying selegiline in rat plasma and successfully applied
to determine the herb–drug pharmacokinetic interactions of P. ginseng extract with selegiline. The results indicated
that during the administration of P. ginseng extract (1 g/kg/day for 5 days), significant decreases in the AUC
and t1/2 for selegiline were observed
as well as an increase in the CL rate, which provides important clinical
information for the prescription of ginseng and selegiline.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Chemicals and Reagents
Selegiline,
noscapine, urethane, heparin sodium, and ammonium formate were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). LC–MS-grade methanol
was purchased from J.T. Baker, Inc. (Phillipsburg, NJ). Triple-deionized
water (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was used for UPLC–MS/MS analysis.
Selegiline was dissolved in methanol to prepare the standard solution
(1 mg/mL) and was diluted by methanol to generate the gradient series.

4.2 UPLC–MS/MS Conditions
A Waters
Acquity UPLC system combined with a Purospher STAR RP-18 end-capped
column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 2 μm, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany),
which was maintained in a column oven at approximately 40 °C,
was used for all analyses. The UPLC system was equipped with a Waters
Xevo tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in positive electrospray
ionization mode. All parent ion transitions, product ion transitions,
cone voltages, and collision energies were optimized and modified
with the MassLynx 4.1 software data platform (Waters Acquity UPLC
system, Milford, USA). Chromatographic separation was carried out
with isocratic elution by a mobile phase consisting of 10 mM ammonium
formate (pH 6.40)/methanol [20:80 (v/v)]. The total run time was 4
min, the injection volume was 10 μL, and the flow rate was set
at 0.2 mL/min. The MS conditions were as follows: electrospray ionization,
positive mode; capillary voltage, 2.9 kV; cone voltage, 14 V; collision
energy, 12 V; desolvation temperature, 400 °C; source temperature,
150 °C; desolvation gas flow, 800 L/h; cone gas flow, 60 L/h;
and collision gas, argon. The monitored ion transitions were m/z 188.2 and 118.98 for selegiline and m/z 414.29 and 220.11 for noscapine (IS).

4.3 Experimental Animals and Drug Administration
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks, 230 ± 20 g) were procured
from the National Yang-Ming University Animal Center, Taipei, Taiwan.
All experimental procedures were certified by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of National Yang-Ming University (IACUC no.
1070519) and were performed according to the National Research Council
guidelines. Rats were fed and housed with a 12 h light/dark cycle.
Laboratory rodent diet 5001 (PMI Feeds, Richmond, IN, USA) and water
were freely available at all times.

4.3.1 Intravenous
Administration of Selegiline
Urethane (1 g/kg) was used to
anesthetize rats via intraperitoneal
injection, and polyethylene tubing (PE50) was implanted at approximately
3–4 cm in both the right jugular vein for blood collection
and the left femoral vein for drug administration. A 150 μL
blood sample was collected at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240,
and 360 min from the left jugular vein after selegiline (10 mg/kg,
dissolved in normal saline, n = 6) was administered
intravenously. Blood samples were placed in Eppendorf tubes containing
heparin and centrifuged at 6000g for 10 min at 4
°C to acquire plasma. Plasma was stored at −20 °C
for analysis. The intravenous administration group was established
to evaluate the bioavailability through the formulation [(AUCp.o./dosep.o.)/(AUCi.v./dosei.v.)] × 100.

4.3.2 Oral Administration of
Selegiline
Selegiline hydrochloride capsules (5 mg) are intended
for administration
to patients. The maximum dose for humans is 10 mg per day, which was
converted to the dose for rats (2 mg/kg). However, during the pilot
study of this experiment, the content of selegiline in rat plasma
was found to be far lower than the LLOQ of the UPLC–MS/MS method.
Hence, the dose administered to the experimental rats was increased
to 30 mg/kg orally in this study.

P. ginseng extract was dissolved in triple-deionized water and administered
by gastric gavage at doses of 1 g/kg and 3 g/kg for 5 consecutive
days during the study. Each group contained six rats. On the fourth
day, after 1 h of ginseng extract administration, a rat was anesthetized
with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal administration,
and a PE 50 tube was catheterized in the right jugular vein for blood
sampling. The catheter was fixed on the dorsal neck region, bypassing
the skin, and capped with a stopper. After surgery, the rats were
allowed to recover in an experimental animal cage for 1 day before
drug administration. On the fifth day, P. ginseng extract was administered 1 h before selegiline administration, and
a 150 μL blood sample was collected from the right jugular vein
at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min after
selegiline (30 mg/kg, p.o.) administration. Blood samples were centrifuged
at 6000g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain plasma.
Plasma was stored at −20 °C until analysis.

4.4 P. ginseng Extraction
P. ginseng (300 g) was cut into
pieces and soaked in 50% ethanol (1 L) for 30 min. The solution was
then continuously boiled for 20 min, and another 500 mL of 50% ethanol.
This cycle was repeated three times. The resulting solution was centrifuged
at 6000g for 10 min, and the supernatant was filtered
through 90 mm filter paper. A rotary evaporator was used to remove
the ethanol solvent. Then, the extracts were freeze-dried to obtain
powder for experimental use.

4.5 Method Validation
The method validation
assays complied with the US FDA bioanalytical method validation guidelines.
The fundamental validation parameters, including the calibration curve,
matrix effect, recovery, accuracy, precision, and stability of the
plasma spiked samples, were determined accordingly.

The calibration
curve was obtained from a series of dilutions of the standard solution.
After spiking blank rat plasma, a series of dilutions at concentrations
of 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 ng/mL were processed with the protein precipitation
sample preparation method. The ratio of the selegiline peak area to
the noscapine (IS) peak area was calculated to verify that the correlation
coefficient (r2) was greater than 0.995.

The matrix effect and recovery were evaluated with three different
sets of samples containing low (5 ng/mL), medium (50 ng/mL), and high
(500 ng/mL) levels of selegiline and 10 ng/mL noscapine (IS) as follows.

Set 1. The standard solution (10 μL) and IS solution (10
μL) were mixed with methanol (180 μL). The solutions were
transferred into vials for UPLC–MS/MS analysis.

Set 2.
Blank plasma (50 μL) and methanol (150 μL) were
vortexed for protein precipitation and centrifuged at 6000g for 10 min at 4 °C. A total of 180 μL of supernatant
was transferred into an Eppendorf tube with the standard solution
(10 μL) and IS (10 μL). After mixing, the solution was
filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter for UPLC–MS/MS
analysis.

Set 3. The standard solution (10 μL), IS (10
μL), blank
plasma (50 μL), and methanol (130 μL) were vortexed for
5 min and centrifuged at 6000g for 10 min at 4 °C.
The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter prior
to UPLC–MS/MS analysis.

The accuracy and precision were
evaluated by analyzing six replicates
on the same day (intraday assay) and on 6 consecutive days (interday
assay). The precision [relative standard deviation (RSD %)] was defined
as the average difference between individual measurements and was
calculated as RSD % = [SD/Cobs] ×
100%. The accuracy (bias %) refers to the difference between the observed
value and the true value and was calculated as bias % = 100 ×
[Cobs – Cnom]/Cnom. The precision and accuracy
values should be within ±15%, whereas the LLOQs should be within
±20%.

4.6 Stability
To test
the stability of
selegiline at low (5 ng/mL), medium (50 ng/mL), and high (500 ng/mL)
concentrations within the linear range in rat plasma under different
conditions, the stability was assessed under four conditions: autosampler
storage, short-term storage, freeze–thaw cycling, and long-term
storage.

To assess the autosampler stability, a processed sample
was stored in an autosampler for 6 h at 10 °C. To assess short-term
stability, the standard solution was placed in blank plasma at room
temperature for 6 h and processed as described for the set 3 sample
preparation. To assess freeze–thaw cycle stability, three freeze–thaw
cycles were performed as follows: samples were frozen for 12 h at
−20 °C and then thawed at room temperature for 12 h. To
assess long-term stability, the standard solution was stored in blank
plasma at −20 °C for a month and then processed. All of
the processed samples were compared with freshly prepared samples,
and the standard deviation for each condition was required to be within
±15%.

4.7 Pharmacokinetic Analysis
WinNonlin
Standard Edition (Version 1.1, Scientific Consulting Inc., Apex, NC,
USA) was employed to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters. A noncompartment
model was used to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters in this
study. The main parameters included the AUC, Cmax, t1/2, CL, and MRT. The bioavailability
was calculated as [(AUCp.o./dosep.o.)/(AUCi.v./dosei.v.)] × 100. SigmaPlot (version 12.0)
was used to calculate the drug concentration versus time profiles
and to perform the statistical analysis. Each pharmacokinetic parameter
was further analyzed by Student’s t-test,
and a p value < 0.05 was regarded as statistically
significant. All data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 6).
