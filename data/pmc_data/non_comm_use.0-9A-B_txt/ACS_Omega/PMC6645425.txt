Introduction
It
is known that quinolin-2(1H)-ones and their
heterocycle-fused hybrid scaffolds exhibit biological and pharmacological
properties.1 Besides classical synthetic
methods for quinolin-2(1H)-ones,2 many transition-metal-catalyzed and -free synthetic versions
have recently been attempted as alternative methods from the viewpoint
of the wide availability of substrates. Several representative examples
are shown in Scheme 1. Larock and Jiao reported that N-substituted o-iodoanilines
and simple anilines undergo carbonylative cyclization with internal
alkynes in the presence of a palladium or rhodium catalyst to give
quinolin-2(1H)-ones (Scheme 1, route a).2−4 Inamoto and Doi reported
palladium-catalyzed intramolecular amidation of N-tosyl-3,3-diarylacrylamides via C(sp2)–H bond
activation for the synthesis of such a scaffold (Scheme 1, route b).5 Such a similar reaction through C–H activation was
shown by palladium-catalyzed coupling and cyclization of simple anilines
with ethyl acrylates (Scheme 1, route c).6 Fujiwara and Vadola
also demonstrated palladium- and gold-catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation
of N-aryl alkynamides leading to quinolin-2(1H)-ones (Scheme 1, route d).7 Acetanilides were
found to be coupled and cyclized with propiolates and acrylates in
the presence of a ruthenium catalyst along with a carboxylic acid
to form quinolin-2(1H)-ones (Scheme 1, route e).8 Such
a similar coupling and cyclization was also exemplified by the iridium-catalyzed
annulation of N-arylcarbamoyl chlorides with internal
alkynes (Scheme 1,
route f).9 Wang et al. have shown that
α-carbamoyl ketene dithioacetals react with o-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl triflate in the presence of a palladium catalyst
to give quinolin-2(1H)-ones (Scheme 1, route g).10 In
addition to these transition-metal-catalyzed synthetic methods shown
in routes a–g of Scheme 1, it is reported that quinolin-2(1H)-ones
also can be eco-friendly when synthesized by transition-metal-free
lactamization of 2-alkenylanilines under carbon dioxide atmosphere
in the presence of NaOtBu (Scheme 1, route h).11 Besides the abovementioned representative examples, many
other transition-metal-catalyzed and -free protocols for quinolin-2(1H)-ones have also been developed and documented.12 In connection with this report, as part of our
ongoing studies on cyclization reactions,13 we recently reported that aryl 2-bromobenzoates and their analogues
are readily cyclized by microwave irradiation to afford 6H-benzo[c]chromen-6-ones and their analogues, respectively.14 The present work arose during the course of
application of such a cyclization protocol to the reaction with amide
analogues, N-aryl-β-bromo-α,β-unsaturated
amides. Herein, this report provides transition-metal-free microwave-assisted
lactamization of such starting amides leading to quinolin-2(1H)-ones and phenanthridin-6(5H)-ones under
mildly basic conditions.

Scheme 1 Representative Synthetic Routes for Quinolin-2(1H)-ones
Results and Discussion
On the basis of our recent report
on microwave-assisted lactonization
of aryl 2-bromobenzoates and their analogues leading to 6H-benzo[c]chromen-6-ones and their 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro
analogues under mildly basic conditions, Table 1 shows several attempted results for the
lactamization of 2-bromo-N-phenylcyclohex-1-enecarboxamide
(1a), leading to 7,8,9,10-tetrahydrophenanthridin-6(5H)-one (2a).14 It
is known that N-aryl-2-halobenzamides are readily
cyclized into phenanthridinones under KOtBu and a catalytic amount of 1,10-phenanthroline.15 However, treatment of 1a in dimethylformamide
(DMF) at 100 °C for 0.5 h in the presence of K2CO3 (5 equiv) along with 1,10-phenanthroline under microwave
irradiation (100 W of initial power) did not afford 2a at all, and 1a was recovered almost completely (Table 1, entry 1). No cyclized
product 2a was also observed with changing 1,10-phenanthroline
to l-proline (Table 1, entry 2). The reaction temperature was critical for the
formation of 2a, and the yield of 2a increased
with the increase in temperature up to 150 °C (Table 1, entries 2–4). Prolonging
the reaction time up to 2 h was needed for the effective formation
of 2a with complete conversion of 1a (Table 1, entries 4–6).
As is the case for the lactonization of aryl 2-bromobenzoates and
their analogues, the reaction also proceeded in the absence of a ligand
(Table 1, entries 7–9).
During the same period of reaction time, the yield of 2a increased from 57% (60% conv of 1a) and 72% (81% conv
of 1a) to 89% (100% conv of 1a). A lower
yield of 2a and conversion of 1a were observed
with a lower amount of K2CO3 (Table 1, entries 10 and 11). The reaction
also proceeded using other bases such as KOH, Cs2CO3, K3PO4, and KOtBu, but the yield of 2a was generally lower than
that with the use of K2CO3 except for KOtBu, which exhibited a similar activity as
K2CO3 (Table 1, entries 12–15). A weak base is of great advantage
to a strong base in terms of tolerance for functional groups in an
organic transformation. Treatment of 1a under usual heating
for 24 h at 150 °C afforded 2a in only 23% yield
(Table 1, entry 16).
As a result, K2CO3 was shown to be the base
of choice and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy
analysis of commercial K2CO3 showed ND (Not
Detected, below method detection limit, 5–10 ppm) of transition
metals such as Co, Cu, Ni, Fe, and Pd.

Table 2 shows the
results for the cyclization of various N-aryl-β-bromo-α,β-unsaturated
amides such as N-aryl-2-bromo-1-cycloalkenecarboxamides
and N-aryl-3-bromoacrylamides under the optimized
conditions. The amides (1b and 1c) having
a methyl group at para- and ortho-positions to N on the N-attached
phenyl ring were also cyclized to give the corresponding 7,8,9,10-tetrahydrophenanthridin-6(5H)-ones (2b and 2c) selectively
in similar yields. The cyclization of 2-bromo-N-phenylcyclohex-1-enecarboxamides
(1d and 1e) having methyl and phenyl substituents
on a cyclohexene ring proceeded likewise to give 7,8,9,10-tetrahydrophenanthridin-6(5H)-ones (2d and 2e), irrespective
of the presence of such substituents on 1d and 1e. From the reaction of the amides (1f–i) having various ring sizes, the corresponding cyclized products 2f–i were also formed in the range of 74–86%
yields. For testing the effect of the position of bromide and carbamoyl
groups on benzo-fused amides, 1j and 1k were
employed. The cyclization took place irrespective of the position.
As is the case for the lactonization of benzo-fused phenyl 2-bromocyclohex-1-enecarboxylates,
in the reaction with 1k, in addition to the expected
product 2k, benzo[i]phenanthridin-5(6H)-one (2k′) was produced by dehydrogenation
of the initially formed 2k and/or initial dehydrogenation
of the starting 1k followed by cyclization under the
employed conditions.14 Such a similar dehydrogenation
was observed in our recent reports on transition-metal-catalyzed and
-free cyclization reactions.13a,16 A similar treatment
of 3-bromo-N-phenylacrylamides 1l–o under the employed conditions also afforded the corresponding quinolin-2(1H)-ones 2l–o, and the product yield
was lower than that when previously described N-aryl-2-bromo-1-cycloalkenecarboxamides
were used.

a Reaction conditions: 1 (0.3 mmol), K2CO3 (1.5 mmol), DMF
(3 mL),
150 °C, and 2 h, under microwave irradiation (100 W of initial
power) and N2.

The present protocol can be extended to the reaction with N-aryl-2-bromobenzamides, which eventually leads to phenanthridin-6(5H)-ones. Phenanthridin-6(5H)-ones are naturally
occurring scaffolds and exhibit a wide spectrum of biological activities.17 Many transition-metal-catalyzed and -free synthetic
methods have been attempted for the construction of such scaffolds,
and several representative synthetic routes are shown in Scheme 2 (routes a–h).17,18 Treatment of 2-bromo-N-phenylbenzamide (1p) under the optimized conditions shown in Table 1 afforded phenanthridin-6(5H)-one (2p) in 85% yield. With N-aryl-2-bromobenzamides
(1q and 1r) having the methyl group at para-
and ortho-positions to N on the N-attached phenyl ring, the cyclized
products (2q and 2r) were selectively formed
in similar yields as observed in the reaction with 1b and 1c. From the reaction of 2-bromo-N-m-tolylbenzamide (1s), the corresponding
cyclized products were obtained as a regioisomeric mixture (2s and 2s′), and the molar ratio was calculated
by the integration of clearly separated methyl signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.18a 2-Bromo-N-phenylbenzamides (1t and 1u)
having methyl and methoxy substituents on the bromoaryl moiety are
also cyclized to give the corresponding phenanthridin-6(5H)-ones (2t and 2u). Not shown in Table 2 is the reaction of
2-bromo-5-fluoro-N-phenylbenzamide having F at the
para-position to Br, which did not proceed at all toward the cyclization,
and the starting material was recovered intact.

Scheme 2 Representative Synthetic
Routes for Phenanthridin-6(5H)-ones
As to the reaction pathway, although it is not
yet fully understood,
this seems to proceed via an initial K2CO3-induced
single-electron transfer to produce 3 and subsequent
6-exo/endo-trig homolytic aromatic substitution (route a) in preference
to a 5-exo-trig ipso mode (route b, Scheme 3).14 When the
reaction was carried out with the addition of radical scavengers such
as 2,2,6,6-(tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl, galvinoxyl, or 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (equimolar amount to 1a) under the employed conditions, 2a was formed in only
15–29% yields. This experimental observation supports evidence
for the radical pathway. A similar radical pathway has been proposed
by us and others.14,15,19 We confirmed that treatment of 1a with 2 equiv of iodobenzene
(4) under the employed conditions gave 2a in 68% yield along with the cross-coupled product 5a (14% yield) and biphenyl (6) (5% yield) (Scheme 4). A similar treatment of o-methyl substituted amide 1v with 4 afforded the cross-coupled product 5b in 61% yield
along with 6 (6% yield). As reported in similar KOtBu-mediated radical cyclizations, the formation
of 5a or 5b indicates that the present reaction
proceeds via a radical pathway.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed a transition-metal-free synthetic
method for quinolin-2(1H)-ones and phenanthridin-6(5H)-ones by K2CO3-promoted radical
cyclization of N-aryl-β-bromo-α,β-unsaturated
amides and N-aryl-2-bromobenzamides under microwave
irradiation. The present reaction provides a new synthetic approach
for such lactam scaffolds, and a continuous study of synthetic applications
for carbo- and heterocycles using such a weak base-promoted transition-metal-free
cyclization under microwave irradiation is in progress.

Experimental
Procedures
General
1H NMR (500 MHz) and 13C NMR (125 MHz) spectra were recorded in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3. The melting points were measured with
a Stanford Research Inc. MPA100 automated melting point apparatus.
The high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data were recorded using
electronic ionization (EI, magnetic sector-electric sector double
focusing mass analyzer) at Korea Basic Science Center (Daegu). Microwave
reactions (CEM, Discover LabMate) were performed in a 5 mL sealed
tube, and the reaction temperature was maintained by an external infrared
sensor. The desired products were separated by thin-layer (a glass
plate coated with Kieselgel 60 GF254, Merck) chromatography
(TLC). The amides 1 were synthesized from the corresponding
carboxylic acids by subsequent treatment of oxalyl chloride and anilines.15,18n Commercially available reagents were used without further purification.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 2
To
a 5 mL microwave reaction tube was added 1 (0.3 mmol),
K2CO3 (0.208 g, 1.5 mmol), and DMF (3 mL). After
stirring at room temperature for 5 min followed by flushing with N2 and sealing the tube, the reaction mixture was stirred at
150 °C for 2 h by microwave irradiation at 100 W initial power.
The mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered through a
short silica gel column (dichloromethane/MeOH = 8:2) to eliminate
inorganic salts. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure
gave a crude mixture, which was separated by TLC (dichloromethane/MeOH
= 97:3) to afford 2. Spectroscopic data for all lactams
are shown below.

Experimental
Procedure for the Mechanism Study
To a
5 mL microwave reaction tube was added 1a or 1v (0.3 mmol), 4 (0.122 g, 0.6 mmol), K2CO3 (0.208 g, 1.5 mmol), and DMF (3 mL). After stirring at room
temperature for 5 min followed by flushing with N2 and
sealing the tube, the reaction mixture was stirred at 150 °C
for 2 h by microwave irradiation at 100 W initial power. The mixture
was cooled to room temperature and filtered through a short silica
gel column (ethyl acetate) to eliminate inorganic salts. Evaporation
of the solvent under reduced pressure gave a crude mixture, which
was separated by TLC (hexane/ethyl acetate = 2:1) to afford 5.
