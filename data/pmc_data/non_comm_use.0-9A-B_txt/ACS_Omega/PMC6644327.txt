In the recent years, polyborate anions
have been considered as
possible candidates for energy. In aqueous solutions, they have been
studied as either hydrogen carriers or anodic fuels. In the solid
state (as an alkali salt), they have been seen as solid electrolytes.
Herein, we focus on sodium 1-oxa-nido-dodecaborate
NaB11H12O, a novel possible candidate for the
aforementioned applications. The compound is soluble in water, and
its stability depends on pH: under acidic conditions, it readily hydrolyzes
while liberating hydrogen, and under alkaline conditions, it is stable,
which is a feature searched for an anodic fuel. Over bulk platinum,
gold, or silver electrode, oxidation takes place. The best performance
has been noticed for the silver electrode. In the solid state, NaB11H12O shows Na+ conductivity at a high
temperature of up to 150 °C. All of these properties are presented
in detail, and hereafter they are discussed while giving indications
of what have to be developed to open up more realistic prospectives
for NaB11H12O in energy.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Carbon as the main element of fossil fuels has played a central
role over the past decades. Nowadays, things are changing and alternative
energy sources and carriers are being taken into the 21st century.
Carbon will still play a role in the field but any fuel like formic
acid and liquid organic carriers will be renewable in order to get
closed carbon cycles.1−3 Search for alternative energy solutions has opened
opportunities for compounds made of other elements. Owing to its position
in the periodic table against carbon, boron was innately envisaged
and, as a matter of fact, boron-based materials have been much investigated
since the early 2000s.4−6

Boron-based materials have been first seen
as liquid-state and
solid-state hydrogen carriers. Typical examples are sodium borohydride
(NaBH4) and ammonia borane (NH3BH3). The former is mainly considered in aqueous solutions in such a
way that the couple NaBH4–4H2O has a
maximum gravimetric hydrogen capacity of 7.3 wt % (if the catalyst
weight is not taken into account) and the stored hydrogen is released
by catalytic hydrolysis.7 The latter material
has been also considered in aqueous solutions for hydrolytic dehydrogenation.8 However, it is more attractive for solid-state
hydrogen storage where most of the stored hydrogen (13 wt %) is generated
by thermolytic dehydrocoupling.9 Many other
boron-based materials (most being derivatives of NaBH4 and
NH3BH3) emerged as possible candidates for hydrogen
storage.4−6 One may cite as uncommon examples the polyborate
anions such as nido-B11H14–, closo-B10H102–, and closo-B12H122–; they may be hydrolyzed
in the presence of a rhodium-based catalyst at 80 °C.10

Boron-based materials like the aforementioned
NaBH4 and
NH3BH3are reducing agents. They (as alkaline
aqueous solutions) can therefore be used as anodic liquid fuels of
direct liquid-fed fuel cells. The former has been much more investigated
owing to a higher theoretical specific energy and a lower cost.11 Yet, the development of the direct borohydride
fuel cell is impeded by technical issues, one of them being the “unwanted”
heterogeneous hydrolysis of NaBH4 (then, in competition
with the expected oxidation).12 This prompted
us to explore the potential of more stable boron-based materials.
We first considered the aqueous solution of sodium octahydrotriborate
(NaB3H8) but, like for NaBH4, heterogeneous
hydrolysis took place in some extent. Accordingly, oxidation of B3H8– on platinum and gold electrodes
was found to generate effective numbers of electrons of about 5 and
10 out of a theoretical total of 18 electrons.13 We secondly considered oxidation of the highly stable aqueous
solution of sodium dodecahydro-closo-dodecaborate
(Na2B12H12). It was found to partially
oxidize over bulk electrodes (platinum, gold or silver), and much
attractively, heterogeneous hydrolysis does not occur.14

Boron-based materials have also shown
to be potential electrolytic
materials of all solid-state Li- or Na-ion batteries. A first example
is lithium borohydride (LiBH4). Its hexagonal P63/mmc phase, forming at about 110 °C,
was found to have a high electrical conductivity of the order of mS
cm–1.15 High Li+ conductivity (0.1 mS cm–1) can be achieved at
room temperature by confining borohydride in the pores of nanoporous
silica.16 A second example of the boron-based
electrolyte is Na2B12H12. The Na+ conductivity was measured as 100 mS cm–1 at 256 °C.17 Appreciable ionic conductivity
(0.5 mS cm–1) was achieved under room conditions
for a derivative, Na3(BH4)(B12H12), made of borohydride and dodecahydro-closo-dodecaborate
anions.18 With such performance, a number
of new compounds, most being the derivatives of the aforementioned
materials, have been developed.19

If the situation is briefly redescribed, it is arguable that boron-based
materials have shown to be compounds with prospectives in three energy
applications: namely, chemical hydrogen storage, anodic fuel of the
direct liquid-fed fuel cell, and solid electrolyte of the all-solid
battery. Of the materials investigated so far, alkali polyborates
have recently emerged and there is a growing interest in them. The
present work is viewed in this context. We initially focused on the
synthesis of sodium tetradecahydro-nido-undecaborate
NaB11H14 but because it is unstable in the basic
medium, we finally focused on the forming derivative, that is, sodium
1-oxa-undecahydro-nido-dodecaborate NaB11H12O. The compound was properly characterized and its
properties related to the aforementioned applications were assessed.
The results that are presented herein allow us to position NaB11H12O in the field of energy storage.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Toward NaB11H12O
Our preliminary objective was the synthesis
of the cluster NaB11H14. It was synthesized
according to a stepwise
process involving NaBH4 as the starting material.20,21 The 11B NMR spectrum (Figure 1a) is in good agreement with a previously
reported one,22 confirming the successful
synthesis of the pure compound. It is worth mentioning the absence
of peaks at δ > 0 ppm, discarding then the formation of B–O
bonds. The molecular structure of NaB11H14 was
further verified by 1H NMR (Figure 2b). All of the signals can be favorably attributed
to the 14 hydrogens of the polyborate anion, discarding the presence
of any other B–H bond-containing product. The signal of highest
intensity at δ 2.3 ppm is attributed to water and the intensity
is higher than that of CH3CN of the anhydrous deuterated
solvent (δ 2 ppm). A last analysis of the sample was performed
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Figure 1c). The fingerprint is typical
of a compound made of B–B and B–H bonds. The presence
of H2O is confirmed by, for example, the bands at 3800–3200
cm–1 (O–H stretching). It is therefore reasonable
to attribute these signals to H2O molecules, complexing
the cluster NaB11H14.

B atoms correlated to the observed peaks) and (b) 1H NMR

For a use as the anodic fuel of the direct liquid-fed fuel
cell,
NaB11H14 is expected to be stable in aqueous
alkaline solution (NaOH 0.1 M). A solution was prepared (to be stored
in an argon-filled glovebox) and the stability was followed by 11B NMR. After 2 h, several new signals at δ < −17
ppm and δ > −10 ppm were observed (Figure 1d), suggesting an evolution
of NaB11H14 in alkaline solutions. The instability
of the anion
B11H14– in aqueous alkaline
solutions was reported elsewhere: Ouassas et al. observed the formation
of the 1-oxa-undecahydro-nido-dodecaborate anion
(B11H12O–) by reaction of
O2 with an alkaline solution of B11H14–.23 Hence, in our conditions,
we waited for the complete oxidation of NaB11H14. The process took 21 days for a vial stored in the glovebox at room
temperature.

The 11B NMR spectrum of the as-formed
compound is shown
in Figure 2a. It is
in good agreement with the molecular structure of the anion B11H12O–.23 The FTIR spectrum of the oxidation product (Figure 2b) is comparable to that of NaB11H14, with the presence of the typical bands for the B–B,
B–H, and O–H bonds. There are also small differences
that are because of the presence of the B–O bond. NMR analysis
of the nucleus 23Na was performed (Figure 2c). The spectrum is featured by only one
signal at δ −7.5 ppm. This is in good agreement with
a cation Na+, compensating the negative charge of an inorganic
anion.24 As a last analysis, the molecular
weight of the product was determined by mass spectrometry (Figure 2d). An m/z value of 146.8 was found. It is comparable to
the molecular weight of B11H12O– (147 g mol–1), knowing besides that the isotopic
pattern score correlates with this anion. Another signal at m/z 126.5 was noted. It is ascribed to
B11H8–, which could be produced
by fragmentation of the parent anion during the analysis. To sum up,
all of the analyses reported above confirm the complete oxidation
of NaB11H14 into NaB11H12O when kept in alkaline solution for 21 days.

NaB11H12O is a white solid. It is crystalline.
Its X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern is reported herein for the first
time (Figure 3). Using
the pattern matching based on the PANalytical X’Pert HighScore
software and the available crystallographic databases (PDF-4+ v. 4.1403),
no matching was found for a screening using the constitutive elements
Na, B, O, and H. An extended search including the elements present
in the initial reactant revealed traces of both NaCl (ref. pattern
00-001-0993) and NaOH·H2O (ref. pattern 00-002-0706).
These observations suggest that the compound is a new crystalline
phase. A work is in progress to obtain a sample with a better crystallinity
and/or a monocrystal to solve the crystal structure and propose a
set of cell parameters.

NaB11H12O (λ = 1.540059 Å).

2.2 Hydrolytic
Stability of NaB11H12O
The stability
of NaB11H12O in aqueous solutions was verified.
Though formed in alkaline solution
(NaOH 0.1 M), a further test was performed for a higher NaOH concentration.
The solid was dissolved in a solution at 1 M NaOH to get a concentration
of 10–5 M and the as-prepared solution was stored
for 25 days under an argon atmosphere (in the glovebox) and at room
temperature. No evolution was observed (Figure 4), allowing to go further with this compound
as the anodic fuel, that is, for oxidation over bulk metal electrodes.

Figure 4 11B NMR spectra of NaB11H12O (10–5 M) in aqueous alkaline (NaOH 1 M) at 0 day (fresh
solution) and after 25 days of storage under argon atmosphere and
room temperature conditions.

The stability in the acidic medium was also envisaged. A
solution
of H2SO4 (0.1 M) was prepared. It was used to
dissolve NaB11H12O. Polyborate anions like B10H102– and B12H122– are known to be stable in the acidic
medium.25,26 In contrast, anions like B11H112–, B11H142–, and B9H92– are hydrolytically
unstable in the acidic medium.27,28 In our conditions,
NaB11H12O reacted violently in the acidic medium.
The reaction was characterized by immediate gas formation: hydrolysis
with generation of hydrogen took place. Like, for example, nido-B11H14–,10 this might open prospectives for chemical hydrogen storage because
NaB11H12O carries 6.7 wt % of hydrogen.

2.3 Oxidability of NaB11H12O
The
stability of NaB11H12O in alkaline
solutions is a required property for an anodic fuel. To the authors’
knowledge, oxidation of such a compound has not been reported before.
The discussion below is thus based on the literature dedicated to
NaBH4,29−31 NaB3H8,13 and NaB12H12.14

The oxidation of NaB11H12O
was first studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with bulk platinum as
the electrode and under natural diffusion conditions (Figure 5a). The concentration of NaOH
was set at 0.1 M and the concentration of the sample at 0.001 M. The
voltammogram resembles that recorded for NaB12H12 with the same electrode.14 For the forward
scan, there are two oxidation peaks. They are in the region of adsorption/desorption
of atomic hydrogen on the electrode surface: aPt1 at −0.73
V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and aPt2 at −0.6 V versus SCE. Dissociative adsorption of B11H12O– followed by oxidation of the adsorbed
hydrogen Hads would happen. Direct partial oxidation of
the anion is also likely to happen. At higher potential, in the region
of platinum oxides, there is no oxidation peak, maybe because of electrode
poisoning by adsorption of polyborate intermediates or desorption
of the same species. For the backward scan, there is one oxidation
peak (cPt1) at −0.69 V versus SCE. It is attributed
to the probable oxidation of Hads. The recorded current
densities are very low (<2 mA cm–2 for e.g. aPt1). Oxidation of B11H12O– over the platinum electrode seems to be tough, which might be explained
by difficult dissociation of B11H12O– on the metal surface and/or the absence of direct oxidation. Additional
CV experiments were performed with different rotation rates of the
platinum rotating electrode (Figure 5b). The oxidation waves were confirmed and the voltammograms
were compared to that recorded under natural diffusion conditions.
The current densities slightly increased with the increase of the
rotation rate. This may be explained by desorption of polyborate intermediates.

for a NaOH 0.1 M solution of NaB11H12O at
a concentration of 0.001 M. (a) Under natural diffusion conditions
(0 rpm); the voltammogram of 0.1 M NaOH (dashed lines) is shown. (b)
Under different rotation rates of the rotating disk electrode (500,
1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 rpm).

The oxidation of NaB11H12O was then
studied
by CV with bulk gold as the electrode and under natural diffusion
conditions (Figure 6a). The voltammogram shows one oxidation peak at +0.22 V versus SCE
(aAu1) during the forward scan and another one at +0.02
V versus SCE (aAu2) during the backward scan. The oxidations
are irreversible. They may be ascribed to direct oxidation of B11H12O– or oxidation of intermediates.
The current density of aAu1 (3.4 mV cm–2) is slightly higher than that of aPt1 but the oxidation
takes place at too positive potential, which makes it less attractive.
Gold does not generate current below −0.2 V versus SCE. It
would be unable to valorize possibly formed Hads species.
The rotation of the electrode (Figure 6b) has a positive effect. The current density for aAu1 increases up to 7 mV cm–2 at 2500 rpm.
Gold is thus less impacted by poisoning from adsorbed polyborate intermediates
than platinum is.

a concentration of 0.001 M. (a) Under natural diffusion conditions
(0 rpm); the voltammogram of 0.1 M NaOH (dashed lines) is shown. (b)
At different rotation rates of the rotating disk electrode (500, 1000,
1500, 2000, and 2500 rpm).

The oxidation of NaB11H12O was finally
studied
by CV with bulk silver as the electrode and under natural diffusion
conditions (Figure 7a). The forward scan is characterized by two oxidation waves: aAg1 at +0.16 V versus SCE and aAg2 at +0.46 V versus
SCE. Direct oxidation of B11H12O– and/or oxidation of intermediates seems to occur, oxidation being
promoted by the formation of surface (hydr)oxides. The backward scan
is featured by one reduction peak (cAg1) at +0.1 V versus
SCE. It implies that the oxidation process is, at least in part, reversible.
The current densities are higher than those measured with the gold
and platinum electrodes. For example, the value is 15.5 mA cm–2 for aAg2. Direct and potentially more
complete oxidation of B11H12O– is feasible on silver. At different rotation rates of the rotating
silver electrode (Figure 7b), the aforementioned oxidation and reduction processes were
confirmed. The current densities were found to slightly increase with,
for example, 21.3 mA cm–2 at 2500 rpm for aAg2. This suggests that the electrode would be less impacted
by surface poisoning caused by adsorbed oxidation/reduction intermediates.

a NaOH 0.1 M solution of NaB11H12O at

(0 rpm); the voltammogram of 0.1 M NaOH (dashed lines) is shown. (b)

The best electrode is bulk silver when the electrochemical
activity
(i.e. current density) is considered only. Oxidation takes place at
high potential; this is not really attractive for an anodic fuel.
From a fundamental point of view, this shows that oxidation occurs
in the metal-oxide region. Like for the anion B12H122–,14 these
results demonstrate the critical role of surface (hydr)oxides in direct
oxidation of B11H12O–. The
challenge would then be to develop multimetallic silver-based catalysts
showing decreased oxidation potentials. If B11H12O– is compared to the anion B12H122–, it has a lower electrochemical activity.

The oxidation products were qualitatively analyzed by mass spectrometry.
Additional CV experiments were performed for each electrode: 1000
cycles where the potential was positively scanned from −1.05
to +0.6 V versus SCE (no reverse scan) were realized. A fraction of
the electrolyte (1 mL) was collected every 100 cycles for analysis.
The analyzed fractions revealed the presence of several m/z values, indicating then a complex composition.
The possible species corresponding to these values were tentatively
denoted on the basis of the available literature.32−38 The results are summarized in Table 1. For the platinum electrode, six different species
were detected but the predominant one is B11H10O–, which presumably forms by oxidation of one
of the H of B11H12O– 1

and ••• as major/predominant product. For clarity,
the m/z values corresponding to
B11H12O– are not shown. The
signal with m/z 116.8 has not been
identified.

Partial oxidative
degradation is a minor path for this electrode.
The product identification allows better understanding of the low
electrochemical activity of platinum, which would be mainly associated
to oxidation of Hads. With respect to the gold and silver
electrodes, less and different species are formed. Three were detected
and identified: B8H10O– >
B7H7O– > B7H10–. The formation of the most abundant product
B8H10O– may be proposed to
take place as follows 2  

Some partial oxidative degradation of B11H12O– occurred on gold and silver. These observations
are in agreement with the CV results obtained with the three electrodes
(Figures 5–7).

2.4 Ionic Conductivity of NaB11H12O
Recently Duchêne et al. reported
a stable
3 V sodium-ion battery based on the use of a solid-state mixed polyborate,
namely Na2(B12H12)0.5(B10H10)0.5, as the electrolyte.39,40 The use of this material was motivated by an excellent thermal stability
up to 300 °C and a high Na+ conductivity of 0.9 mS
cm–1 at 20 °C. This is a promising achievement
that follows one of the first works about the use of thermally and
(electro)chemically stable sodium polyborates (e.g. Na2B12H12) as potential solid-state electrolytes.17−19

We measured ionic conductivities of NaB11H12O by using a broadband impedance spectrometer in a range
of frequency varying from 0.01 Hz and 1 MHz, with an applied ac voltage
of 1 V, and for temperatures from 150 to 0 °C. The results are
shown in Figure 8a.
Typically, the real part of the ac conductivity, σ(ω,T), results from the combination of three contributions 3  

Figure 8 (a) Bode representation of the conductivity
vs the frequency in the logarithm scale recorded at temperatures varying
from 150 to 0 °C. (b) Corresponding Arrhenius plot of conductivity
recorded for NaB11H12O; the dashed line corresponds
to the linear least-square fit.

The polarization component σ′(ω,T), corresponding to the increasing part of the signal observed
at
high frequency, arises from the local rearrangement of the Na+ charges causing dipolar reorientation. It is preponderant
in the electrical response recorded in the lower temperature domain.
The dc conductivity plateau σdc(T), resulting from the long-range redistribution of the Na+ ions, dominates the intermediate frequency region. Its contribution
increases with the temperature, in agreement with a thermally activated
process. The Maxwell Wagner Sillars contribution σMWS(ω,T), corresponding to the signal decrease
at a low frequency, is only observed for data recorded at high temperatures.
It is because of the charge accumulation at the sample/electrode interface
and actually supports the ionic features of the charge carriers. Compared
to Na2B12H12,17 the conductivity performances of NaB11H12O are comparable (σ < 10–5 S cm–1 at T > 150 °C). However,
unlike
other sodium polyborates (e.g. NaB11H14 with
σ between 10–2 and 10–1 S
cm–1 at 90–160 °C, and Na2B10H10 with ca. 8 × 10–2 S cm–1 at 150 °C),41,42 the conductivity performances of NaB11H12O
are quite low in relation with a lower density and/or lower mobility
of the charge carriers. This point is confirmed by the determination
of the activation energy (Ea) associated
with the ionic transport process. It was deduced from the linear fitting
of ln(σ × T) versus 1/T (Figure 8b), according
to the Arrhenius equation 4  

The energy Ea corresponds to 0.88 eV.
It is higher than that reported for the other super-conducting sodium
polyborates (0.41 eV for NaB11H14, and 0.47
eV for Na2B10H10).41,42

The conduction properties of NaB11H12O are
comparable to those reported for Na2B12H12,17 and for both compounds, the
conduction properties confine to high temperatures (<150 °C).
Better performance could be achieved through the development of new
materials (derivatives) based on NaB11H12O,
as it was in fact done for Na2B12H12 with Na3(BH4)B12H12.18

3 Conclusion
In the
present work, sodium tetradecahydro-nido-undecaborate
NaB11H14 was first synthesized
but it is unstable in the basic medium. It slowly oxidizes into another
alkali polyborate, namely, sodium 1-oxa-nido-dodecaborate
NaB11H12O. This alkali polyborate was then characterized
and assessed as the potential material for energy storage:(i) NaB11H12O is
not stable in the acidic medium. It hydrolyzes while liberating hydrogen.
It could be seen as the potential chemical hydrogen storage material
(i.e. hydrogen carrier), provided acidic water is used for hydrolysis
or metal-based catalysts are developed to accelerate the kinetics.

(ii) NaB11H12O in
an aqueous alkaline solution is hardly oxidized over a bulk platinum
electrode. The electrochemical activity is low, with less than 2 mA
cm–2 (at −0.73 V vs SCE). Better activity
is achieved with gold and above all silver. The current density is
higher than 15.5 mA cm–2 under natural diffusion
conditions with the latter electrode. Direct partial oxidation of
the anion B11H12O– (or of
intermediates) is likely to occur but the process takes place at a
high potential. Further works are necessary to improve the electrocatalytic
activity of silver, for example by combining it with other metals
toward the formation of multimetallic nanosized electrocatalysts.

(iii) The conductivity of
solid-state
NaB11H12O was measured between 0 and 150 °C.
It is low, with σ < 10–5 S cm–1 at T < 150 °C. The conduction activation
energy was determined as being 0.88 eV. Improved performances, even
at lower temperatures, could nevertheless be achieved by chemically
modifying/doping NaB11H12O.



In conclusion, the hydrolytic, oxidation, and conductivity
properties
of NaB11H12O have been investigated. It stands
out that the compound is not stable in the acidic medium, it is stable
in the alkaline medium, it is rather stable toward oxidation (over
Pt, Au, and Ag electrodes) in the alkaline medium, and it shows low
mobility of the charge carrier Na+. Though the current
performances are below the state of the art, there is a room for improvements
for NaB11H12O, especially by focusing on the
research avenues mentioned above.

4 Materials
and Methods
The synthesis of NaB11H14 was adapted from
a protocol reported elsewhere.20,21 In an argon-filled
glovebox (MBraun M200B, O2 <0.1 ppm, H2O
<0.1 ppm), 15 g of NaBH4 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 mL
of anhydrous diglyme (Sigma-Aldrich) were transferred into a three-necked
round-bottom Schlenk flask. The flask was connected to a vacuum-argon
line, a refrigerant, and an addition funnel containing 63 mL of boron
trifluoride diethyl etherate BF3·O(C2H5)2 (Sigma-Aldrich). The slurry was heated up to
105 °C. The reactant BF3·O(C2H5)2 was added dropwise over a period of 6 h. A yellow
precipitate was formed 5  

The precipitate was filtered and heated at
80 °C to evaporate
most of the solvent. Because of residual diglyme and impurities, an
aqueous solution (1.31 M) of trimethylamine hydrochloride (CH3)3NHCl (Sigma-Aldrich) was added onto the precipitate 6  

Most of the impurities were
dissolved in water, whereas the intermediate
(CH3)3NHB11H14 (s) was
in the form of a yellow precipitate. A last purification was done
by washing with acetone C3H6O (Sigma-Aldrich),
followed by addition of water at 57 °C (boiling temperature of
acetone). Owing to the miscibility of acetone in water and the insolubility
of (CH3)3NB11H14, a pure
compound was recovered by filtration and drying under vacuum. As a
final step, (CH3)3NHB11H14 (1 g) was reacted with an aqueous solution of NaOH (0.208 g) at
80 °C for 2 h. Cation substitution took place 7  

The yield was found
to be 80%. The purity was 99%. NaB11H14 was
not stable in alkaline aqueous solution (NaOH
0.1 M). It evolved into a new product, which was found to be NaB11H12O. A complete oxidation of NaB11H14 into NaB11H12O took 21 days
under an argon atmosphere.

The polyborate anions in aqueous
solution were analyzed by nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) on Bruker AVANCE-300: 1H (probe
head dual 1H/13C, 300.13 MHz, CD3CN, 30 °C), 11B, and 23Na (probe head
BBO10, 96.29 and 79.39 MHz, D2O, 30 °C). In the solid
state, NaB11H14 and NaB11H12O were analyzed by FTIR (Nicolet IS50 Thermo Fisher Scientific; 128
scans). The crystallinity of NaB11H12O was verified
by powder XRD. The experiment was performed on a PANalytical X’Pert
diffractometer equipped with an X’Celerator detector. The diffraction
pattern was recorded using a monochromatic wavelength (Cu Kα1 λ = 1.540593 Å) in the 2θ range 5°–100°
with an operating voltage of 40 kV and a beam current of 40 mA using
40 kV. The sample in the powder form was placed into a glass capillary
(1 mm diameter) sealed to prevent any decomposition under moisture
of ambient air.

Oxidation of NaB11H12O
was studied by CV
using a μAutolab Type III potentiostat using a three-electrode
cell. SCE was used as the reference electrode. The platinum wire was
used as the counter electrode. Platinum (Ø 2
mm) or gold (Ø 2 mm) or silver (Ø 4 mm) was used as the rotating disk working electrode. Outgassed
Milli-Q Water (18.2 MΩ cm, <3 ppb total organic carbon) was
used. For any new measurement, the glassware and electrodes were treated
with peroxymonosulfuric acid H2SO5 (Caro’s
acid) overnight and carefully washed with Milli-Q water; then the
working electrode surfaces were polished with diamond paste. The cell,
thermostated at 20 °C, was degassed with argon. In doing oxygen
reduction and carbonation of the electrolyte from ambient carbon dioxide
was avoided. In order to avoid water splitting, the voltage range
was: −1.05 to +0.6 V versus SCE. The electrolyte features were
as follows: 0.1 M NaOH and 0.001 M NaB11H12O.

Mass spectrometry experiments (MS; Waters Micromass, Wythenshawe,
Manchester, UK; Quattro Micro mass spectrometer with electrospray
ionization in negative mode) were performed to check the molecular
weight of the anion B11H12O– and to qualitatively analyze the oxidation by-products. Each sample
(in solution) was analyzed by direct injection (FIA: flow injection
analysis) using a Waters 2695 pump autosampler with a 20 μL
loop. The mobile phase was a 50/50 (vol %) mixture of water and acetonitrile
(both of HPLC grade). The spectrometer operated at a constant flow
rate such as 0.25 mL min–1. The detection conditions
were as follows: capillary potential 3.5 kV; cone potential 30 V;
source temperature 120 °C; desolvation temperature 450 °C;
cone gas flow 50 L h–1; and desolvation gas flow
450 L h–1. The nebulizer gas was N2.
The experimental spectrum of each identified chemical species (the
identification being made on the basis of the available literature32−38 and on assimilating the m/z value
to a molecular weight) was then compared to the modeled spectrum (calculated
from the supposed molecular weight) to confirm the identification
made.

Impedance measurements were performed on a broadband dielectric
spectrometer and Novocontrol alpha analyzer, over a frequency range
from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz with an applied ac voltage of 1 V. The temperature
of the sample was controlled by the Quatro Novocontrol system. Measurements
were collected from 150 to 0 °C on the anhydrous solid, obtained
by in situ heating at 150 °C for 2 h. The measurements were performed
on a pellet, with 0.5 and 12 mm of thickness and diameter, respectively,
and using the two-probe method.
