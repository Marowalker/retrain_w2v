A multidisciplinary
strategy, including both biochemical and biophysical
studies, was proposed here to evaluate the potential of lipid nanoaggregates
consisting of a mixture of a gemini–bolaamphiphilic lipid (C6C22C6) and the well-known helper lipid
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine
(DOPE) to transfect plasmid DNA into living cells in an efficient
and safe way. For that purpose, several experimental techniques were
employed, such as zeta potential (phase analysis light scattering
methodology), agarose gel electrophoresis (pDNA compaction and pDNA
protection assays), small-angle X-ray scattering, cryo-transmission
electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, fluorescence-assisted
cell sorting, luminometry, and cytotoxicity assays. The results revealed
that the cationic lipid and plasmid offer only 70 and 30% of their
nominal positive () and negative charges (),
respectively. Upon mixing with DOPE,
they form lipoplexes that self-aggregate in typical multilamellar
Lα lyotropic liquid-crystal nanostructures with sizes
in the range of 100–200 nm and low polydispersities, very suitably
fitted to remain in the bloodstream and cross the cell membrane. Interestingly,
these nanoaggregates were able to compact, protect (from the degrading
effect of DNase I), and transfect two DNA plasmids (pEGFP-C3, encoding
the green fluorescent protein, and pCMV-Luc, encoding luciferase)
into COS-7 cells, with an efficiency equal or even superior to that
of the universal control Lipo2000*, as long as the effective +/–
charge ratio was maintained higher than 1 but reasonably close to
electroneutrality. Moreover, this transfection process was not cytotoxic
because the viability of COS-7 cells remained at high levels, greater
than 80%. All of these features make the C6C22C6/DOPE nanosystem an optimal nonviral gene nanocarrier
in vitro and a potentially interesting candidate for future in vivo
experiments.

Introduction
Nucleic acids are nowadays
an attractive source of therapeutic
agents because of their intimate structure–activity relationships
and their highly specific mode of action, allowing exploitation of
the cellular machinery in a predictable fashion to either stimulate
or silence the expression of virtually any protein, with reduced toxicity
and lessened side effects.1−4 These aspects are the basis of gene therapy, an exciting
branch of medicine that aims to cure diseases at a molecular level
by either repairing damaged cellular DNA5−7 or silencing the expression
of abnormal genes.8−10 In the case of biomolecular drugs such as nucleic
acids, the carrier becomes a decisive protagonist, allowing the drug
to overcome the physiological barriers and reach its target in a fully
functional form to carry out the designed therapeutic function, given
that nucleic acids are easily degraded by nucleases in biological
fluids and their membrane-crossing abilities and cellular uptake are
seriously limited by their inherently large size, rigidity, and negative
charge.11,12 Gene carriers or gene vectors are usually
classified into two groups: viral and nonviral. Although viral gene
vectors are normally more effective, they may cause serious adverse
effects in the organism.13−15 Accordingly, researchers have
mostly focused their efforts on the development of nonviral carriers
capable of compacting, protecting, and transporting genetic materials
in an efficient and safe way by combining high transfection efficiencies
(TEs) with low cytotoxicity outputs.6,16−21

Among the nonviral gene vectors available, a wide series of
gemini
cationic lipids (GCLs), constituted by two hydrophobic chains and
two hydrophilic cationic heads linked by a spacer, have proven in
the last decade their capacity to compact, protect, and release DNA
in the cytoplasm of living cells.6,22−24 Together with these GCLs, another class of lipids, known as bolaform
or bolaamphiphilic (BA) lipids characterized by bearing two hydrophilic
(ionic or nonionic) heads separated by one, two, or three long hydrophobic
spacers (usually alkyl chains of 22–32 carbon atoms), have
also exhibited potential as gene vectors.25−29 Their peculiar structure means that, in general terms,
they tend to self-aggregate, forming monolayer-type membranes with
less permeability, greater rigidity, and better durability than the
lipid bilayer-type membranes typically formed from gemini lipids.
In fact, BA lipids have already been successfully used as nonviral
gene vectors in cases where at least one or both heads are positively
charged.30−41

In this work, we have evaluated the potential of a so-called
gemini–bolaamphiphilic
(GBA) lipid as a novel gene vector. The GBA lipid was synthesized
with a hybrid structure between that of a gemini lipid (GCL), insofar
it contains two secondary amine-type cation heads each of them attached
to short hydrophobic chains of 6 carbon atoms, and that of a BA lipid
in the sense that the cationic heads are connected by a long spacer
of 22 carbon atoms (referred to as C6C22C6, Scheme 1).
The disproportion between the short length of the hydrophobic chains
(6C) and that of the long spacer (22C) results in the latter, potentially
playing a leading role first in the self-aggregation process and then
in the formation of the lipoplex in the presence of DNA. As usual,
with this type of nanocarrier, the cationic lipid was mixed with 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), a well-known
fusogenic and helper lipid that promotes cellular uptake.42−44 The C6C22C6/DOPE mixed lipid vector
was used in this work to compact and transfect two DNA plasmids into
COS-7 cells: one encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (pEGFP-C3)
and the other one encoding luciferase (pCMV-Luc). Accompanying this
biochemical evaluation of the TE (fluorescence-assisted cell sorting
(FACS) and luminometry) and cytotoxicity (alamarBlue assay), a biophysical
study is included, comprising the size [dynamic light scattering (DLS)],
structural [cryo-transmission electronic microscopy (cryo-TEM), small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM)], and electrochemical
(zeta potential and gel electrophoresis) characterizations of the
optimal compositions of C6C22C6/DOPE–pDNA
lipoplexes, as previously determined from their biochemical performance.

in This Work and detailed structure of the C6C22C6 GBA lipid
Results and Discussion
Multidisciplinary and complementary
biophysical and biochemical
studies, as those reported herein, are needed to assess, with a wider
perspective, the ability of a given nanosystem to compact, protect,
transport across cell membranes and deliver the nucleic acids into
the cell interior, overcoming the physiological barriers that the
nanocarrier–DNA complex may find along such a remarkable journey.

The electrochemical evaluation of the C6C22C6/DOPE–pDNA system, consisting of electrophoretic
mobility/zeta potential and agarose gel electrophoresis assays (compaction
and protection of pDNA against degradation by DNase I), is shown in Figures 1 and 2 at different molar compositions of the cationic lipid in
the mixed lipid (α). These three experiments allowed us to (i)
check whether the vector was capable of compacting pDNA and at what
lipoplex compositions this compaction would occur (inset in Figure 1); (ii) accurately
determine the electroneutrality of the system and thus the effective
charges of both cationic GBA lipid and plasmid DNA (Figure 1); and (iii) confirm that the
nanocarrier is able to protect adequately the plasmid against the
degrading effect of DNase I (Figure 2). The inset in Figure 1 reports an agarose gel electrophoresis experiment,
where pDNA was loaded as a control in the first lane of the gel and
C6C22C6/DOPE–pDNA lipoplexes
at different mass ratios (mL/mDNA = (mL+ + mL0)/mDNA, where mL+, mL0, and mDNA denote
the masses of the cationic gemini lipid, zwitterionic helper lipid,
and nucleic acid, respectively) were loaded in lanes 2–4. The
two fluorescence bands observed in lane 1 are characteristic of the
coiled and supercoiled forms of plasmid DNA, whereas the absence of
such bands in lanes 2–4, together with the fact that pDNA remains
immobile in the well of the gel, is a clear indication of the effective
compaction of pDNA by the C6C22C6/DOPE lipid vector. In particular, at α = 0.5, compaction is
already achieved at a mass ratio of mL/mDNA = 0.8. Additionally, this indicates
that electroneutrality in this lipoplex must be reached at compositions
below 0.8 when α = 0.5. Figure 1 also shows the plot of zeta potential versus mL/mDNA, displaying
a typical sigmoidal profile at different molar compositions. From
the electroneutrality ratios, (mL/mDNA)ϕ, that is, the mL/mDNA ratios at
which charge compensation occurs and the zeta potential is zero, the
effective charges of C6C22C6 () and pDNA () were calculated by a procedure
developed
by us and fully described elsewhere.45,46 The cationic
lipid and plasmid were found to exhibit only 70 and 30% of their nominal
positive () and
negative () charges, respectively, which is a behavior
typically observed in this type of systems.46−48 It is well-known
that plasmids in supercoiled conformation are able to retain a significant
amount of Na+ cations under physiological conditions, ostensibly
reducing their anionic character. This fact may be advantageous for
our objectives because the lower the anionic character of the plasmid,
the smaller the amount of cationic vector necessary to compact it
and yield a net positive charge (necessary to cross the also negatively
charged cell membrane), thus reducing the overall cytotoxicity of
the nanocarrier. Such understanding of the effective charges allowed
us to work with effective charge ratios by using the following equation: 1

by ctDNA at several molar compositions of the cationic lipid in the
mixed lipids (α = 0.5, pink line) and with pDNA at α =
0.2, 0.5, and 0.7 (blue, red, and black lines), respectively. Inset:
agarose gel electrophoresis of C6C22C6/DOPE–pDNA at several mL/mDNA mass ratios and α = 0.5. Free pDNA
(lane 1) was used as the control.

Figure 2 Protection assay of pDNA against degradation by DNase I (gel electrophoresis
experiment): (a) pCMV-Luc plasmid, (b) pEGFP-C3 plasmid, and (c) a
visual guide. In both experiments: lane 1, pDNA; lane 2, pDNA–DNase
I; and lanes 3–6, C6C22C6/DOPE–pDNA
lipoplexes at different molar compositions of the cationic lipid in
the mixed lipids (α = 0.2 in lanes 3–4 and α =
0.5 in lanes 5–6) and different effective charge ratios of
the lipoplex, ρeff = 4 (lanes 3 and 5) and ρeff = 10 (lanes 4 and 6).

For a nanosystem to become a suitable gene vector, in addition
to being able to efficiently compact the plasmid and generate a purely
cationic entity, the system must be capable of protecting the nucleic
acid against the degrading effect of the DNases present in human serum.
This information is crucial when attempting to carry out in vivo studies.
As can be seen in Figure 2, where the protection experiments against DNase I are presented,
the mixed lipid system C6C22C6/DOPE
efficiently protects the two plasmids used in this work, one encoding
the GFP (pEGFP-C3) and the other one encoding luciferase (pCMV-Luc).
Thus, lane 1 (naked pDNA) shows the characteristic fluorescence bands
from the emission of ethidium bromide (EtBr) intercalated within the
double helix of the plasmid DNA in its coiled and supercoiled forms,
whereas lane 2 reflects the progress of the free plasmid along the
gel in the absence of a vector after digestion treatment with DNase
I. C6C22C6/DOPE–pDNA lipoplexes
at different compositions and effective charge ratios were loaded
in lanes 3–6 after digestion with DNase I and subsequent treatment
with an anionic surfactant [Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)], breaking
the lipoplexes and freeing the plasmid. The absence of fluorescence
bands in lane 2 and their presence in lanes 3–6 in both gels
(Figure 2a,b) demonstrate
that DNase I degraded the free plasmid in lane 2 but it did not have
access to the plasmid compacted by the vector C6C22C6/DOPE at any of the studied cationic molar compositions
of the mixed lipid (α = 0.2 and 0.5) and effective charge ratios
(ρeff = 4 and 10).

These observations allow
us to conclude that the C6C22C6/DOPE
lipidic system shows the required features
to be, at least potentially, a suitable nonviral gene vector, given
that it is capable of compacting, protecting from DNases, and transporting
pDNA through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm. To verify whether
this process could actually be carried out efficiently and safely,
transfection experiments and cell viability assays were performed
on COS-7 cells in the presence of 10% serum. Figure 3 shows the TE by means of the expression
levels of (a) GFP (for plasmid pEGFP-C3), given in terms of % GFP
(percentage of cells expressing GFP) and/or MFI (mean fluorescence
intensity per cell) obtained from FACS experiments, and (b) luciferase
(for plasmid pCMV-Luc), expressed in terms of nanograms of luciferase/milligrams
of protein, as obtained from luminometry experiments. In both cases,
the experiments were performed at two molar compositions of the mixed
lipids, α = 0.2 and 0.5, and at two different effective charge
ratios of the lipoplex, ρeff = 4 and 10, using Lipofectamine
2000 (Lipo2000*) as a positive control. Overall, the results presented
in Figure 3a for plasmid
pEGFP-C3 indicate that the TE levels are superior at ρeff = 4 to those at ρeff = 10, both at α = 0.2
and 0.5. In particular, the values of % GFP and MFI at ρeff = 4 and α = 0.2 or 0.5 are comparable to or even
slightly higher than those with Lipo2000*, whereas at ρeff = 10, they are equal to or slightly lower than those of
the control. On the other hand, Figure 3b shows that in the case of plasmid pCMV-Luc, there
is a clear superiority in the nanograms of luciferase expressed per
milligrams of protein obtained at ρeff = 4 than that
at ρeff = 10 at the two α values studied, the
levels of TE being comparable to those of the control only at α
= 0.5.

lipid in the mixed lipids (α = 0.2 and 0.5): (a) expressed as
% GFP (solid bars) and MFI (squared bars) for plasmid pEGFP-C3 and
(b) expressed as nanograms of luciferase per milligrams of protein
for plasmid pCMV-Luc. The experiments were performed in the presence
of 10% serum (FBS). The orange and green bars correspond to the effective
charge ratios of ρeff = 4 and 10 in the lipoplex,
respectively. The gray bar corresponds to Lipo2000*, used here as
the positive control.

Gene therapy protocols require vectors not only to be efficient
for the compaction, protection, transport, and delivery of plasmids
inside the cell but also to perform these functions in a safe way.
In this regard, the cytotoxicity of C6C22C6/DOPE–pDNA lipoplexes in COS-7 cells was evaluated
by the alamarBlue assay at the same molar compositions and effective
charge ratios used in the cell transfection experiments. Figure 4 reports the results
obtained with the plasmids pEGFP-C3 and pCMV-Luc. Viability percentages
above 60% were assumed to be reasonably acceptable, with values over
80% being the most desired. It is worth noting that the obtained cell
viability levels are above 80% in both cases for ρeff = 4 at both molar ratios of α = 0.2 and 0.5. However, at ρeff = 10, the viability clearly falls below 80% and in one
case even below 60%. Note that the cell viability of the Lipo2000*
control is around 90%; therefore, it can be concluded that the nanovector
used presents cellular viabilities comparable to those of the control
only at the effective charge ratio of ρeff = 4. These
results are consistent with other previously reported results48,49 and suggest that the viability of the cells is seriously compromised
at high ρeff values, that is, at high cationic lipid
contents, as one would expect.

Figure 4 Cell viability of COS-7 cells in the presence
of C6C22C6/DOPE–pDNA lipoplexes
at two molar compositions
of the cationic lipid in the mixed lipids (α = 0.2 and 0.5).
The plasmids used were (a) pEGFP-C3 and (b) pCMV-Luc. The experiments
were performed with 10% serum (FBS). The orange and green bars correspond
to the effective charge ratios of ρeff = 4 and 10
in the lipoplex, respectively. The gray bar corresponds to Lipo2000*,
used here as the positive control. The results were normalized to
those obtained for untreated cells (100%).

So as to correlate the cellular activity and viability results
with the structural characteristics of the studied lipoplexes, several
key factors, such as the size, structure, morphology, and pDNA–mixed
lipid interactions, were evaluated. For that purpose, DLS, SAXS, cryo-TEM,
and AFM experiments were performed at the optimum effective charge
ratio determined in the biochemical study (ρeff =
4) and at different compositions of the mixed lipid system. Table
S1 in the Supporting Information summarizes
the size (hydrodynamic diameter, Dh) and
polydispersity (PDI) values for the C6C22C6/DOPE–pDNA lipoplexes at α = 0.2 and 0.5. The
obtained sizes (in the range of 100–200 nm) and reasonably
good homogeneity (low polydispersities of 0.2–0.3) are in the
optimal range to cross the cell membrane and circulate in the bloodstream,
making these lipoplexes potentially suitable DNA nanocarriers. No
significant effect of the cationic lipid molar composition in the
mixed lipid or of the effective charge ratio in the lipoplexes was
observed on neither of these two parameters.

Figure 5 summarizes
the results of cryo-TEM (panels a and b) and SAXS (panel c) experiments
at ρeff = 4 and different molar compositions (α).
Both experimental techniques revealed that these lipoplexes self-organize
in multilamellar Lα phases of lyotropic liquid crystals,
as previously reported for other mixed lipid-type nonviral gene vectors.49−51 Notice the presence of clear fingerprint patterns (indicated with
a white point in the micrographs of panels a and b) regardless of
the composition α in the mixed lipid system. The periodic repetition
of lipid layers was studied by fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis
on certain zones of the micrographs (the yellow square in Figure 5a), where patterns
of multilamellar stacking were found. The inset in Figure 5a shows, as an example, a FFT
profile whose diffraction spots are typical of a lamellar structure.
Additionally, the Bragg maxima reported in the SAXS diffractograms
(Figure 5c) match adequately
the hkl Miller indexes characteristic of multilamellar
Lα structures, consisting of alternating layers of
mixed lipids and supercoiled plasmid DNA in a sandwich-type fashion
(see the scheme in Figure 5d), in total agreement with the cryo-TEM images. The interlayer
distance (d) related to the q factor
of the first maximum (d = 2π/q100) has an average value of 5.3 ± 0.3 nm, being
not appreciably influenced by the composition of the mixed lipid system
(α) within experimental error (Figure 5e). This distance, clearly shorter than the
typical one (∼7 nm) found in other systems composed of gemini
cationic/DOPE lipid mixtures,45,51 can be expressed as
the sum of two thicknesses: that of the region where the hydrophobic
chains of the lipids self-aggregate, traditionally denoted as dm, plus that of the aqueous region where the
plasmid DNA is located, known as dw. Given
the particular structure of the cationic lipid used (C6C22C6), two alternative arrangements can be
proposed for the mixed lipid layer, both compatible with the SAXS
results. The first one is a lipidic layer consisting of C6C22C6 cationic lipid molecules organized in
a monolayer fashion mixed with DOPE helper lipid molecules in a bilayer
disposition. In this case, the length of the C22 spacer
of C6C22C6 determines the thickness
of the monolayer, with the two hydrophobic C6 alkyl chains
oriented inwardly with the two cationic quaternary ammonium heads
exposed to both sides of the monolayer. This arrangement necessarily
imposes an important interpenetration (of around seven methylene groups)
of the hydrophobic chains of DOPE (18 carbon atoms) so that the system
can self-organize in a bilayer fashion, matching well the d value of 5.3 nm imposed by the spacer length of the cationic
GBA lipid. The second arrangement is the typical lipid bilayer consisting
of a mixture of C6C22C6 and the DOPE
helper lipid. In this case, the 22-carbon-atom spacer linking the
cationic heads of C6C22C6 is forced
to bend inwardly in a V-shaped manner so as to accommodate itself
in the bilayer and the DOPE chains have to necessarily overlap extensively
to fit the interlayer distance (5.3 nm) obtained from the diffractograms. Figure 6 shows a simplified
2D view of the Lα structure exhibited by these lipoplexes,
with the two options discussed above. In both cases, either as a monolayer
(Figure 6a) or as a
lipid bilayer (Figure 6b), the thickness according to the Tanford’s model52 was estimated to be dm ≈ 3.0 nm, which would lead to a dw value of ca. 2.3 nm, which is enough to host the plasmid DNA. Several
features can be highlighted: (i) both self-organization structures
are compatible with the experimental thickness of d = 5.3 ± 0.3 nm and with the observation that d is not influenced by the DOPE content (Figure 5e); (ii) both arrangements have been previously
reported for bolaform lipid systems27−29,33 and derived gemini cationic/DOPE lipid systems;45,47,51 and (iii) both arrangements provide an explanation
of why the thickness of the lipid layer (d) is notably
lower than that found in other GCL/DOPE mixed lipid systems forming
a bilayer with no interpenetration of the lipid hydrophobic alkyl
chains. Although the apparent lack of influence of the DOPE content
on d confers the same weight to both structural options,
the monolayer arrangement seems more feasible from a molecular interaction
point of view, although further experiments would be necessary to
confirm this.

pDNAs (pEGFP-C3 or pCMV-Luc) self-organized in a Lα multilamellar lyotropic liquid-crystal structure. The inset at the
bottom of the figure shows a magnified view of the yellow squared
zone of the lipoplex, with two possible arrangements compatible with
the SAXS and cryo-TEM results: (a) the 22C spacer of C6C22C6 forms a lipid monolayer and (b) C6C22C6 is organized in a typical lipid
bilayer, with the spacer oriented inward and the bilayer with a V
shape. In both cases, DOPE is organized in a lipid bilayer fashion,
with the hydrophobic chains displaying extensive overlapping to fit
the dimensions determined for the interlamellar distance (d).

Undoubtedly, the way
pDNA interacts with lipidic membranes is another
important factor affecting the efficiency of the transfection process.
AFM is known to be one of the techniques of choice to visualize these
interactions. Accordingly, AFM experiments were performed for C6C22C6/DOPE samples (at α = 0.2
and 0.5) in the absence and presence of pDNA at ρeff = 4 and several incubation times (Figure 7). In Figure 7a, the topographic image of a supported lipid bilayer
(SLB) of C6C22C6/DOPE at α
= 0.2 is shown. The SLB does not fully cover the mica surface and
exhibits a number of holes of ≥200 nm size (shown in red in
the image). Such holes allowed us to deduce the thickness of the layer,
showing a step height of 4.4 ± 0.4 nm from the mica surface to
the top of the lipid layer. It is possible to observe nonadsorbed
lipid structures as small yellow-white spikes. Upon injection of pDNA,
no significant modification of the shape of the structures was observed
at 60 min. After 180 min, although the margins of the holes remained
almost unmodified, some aggregates were deposited on the SLB, as observed
in the middle right region as white scratching marks. A different
behavior was observed for the C6C22C6/DOPE SLB at α = 0.5. Figure 7b depicts the topographic image of this SLB, showing
a structure similar to that in Figure 7a. In this case, the holes present a similar step height
than before (4.6 ± 0.4 nm), but wider holes of 1 or 2 μm
are observed. The mica surface in these wider holes is not flat but
contains some small lipid aggregates on it. Upon injection of pDNA,
some aggregates can be observed inside the wider holes but not on
the lipid layer. This fact suggests that these aggregates are weakly
attached to the lipid surface, thus possibly being swept away during
scanning. This effect is visible up to 60 min of incubation with no
significant changes on the edges of the small holes. After 180 min
of incubation, the small holes become slightly wider and, in some
regions, they merge to form wider structures. Such a different behavior
of pDNA with lipid membranes suggests specific interactions of pDNA
depending on the α value. The AFM studies revealed that pDNA
modifies the SLB morphology in a more effective manner at α
= 0.5 than at α = 0.2. Apparently, when pDNA molecules interact
with the SLB at α = 0.5, a reduction of the lateral pressure
between the lipids is observed, promoting the arrangement of the lipids
into an SLB, even when the lipids are adsorbed on a solid surface
such as the mica surface. This fact is evident for the rearrangement
of the lipids in the SLB, that is, the fusion of holes, without solubilization
of part of the SLB. When pDNA interacts with the SLB at α =
0.2, this effect is less evident. All of these findings allow us to
conclude the following. First, pDNA molecules seem to be more shielded
by mixed lipids when the amount of the GBA lipid is moderate. This
feature correlates well with the enhanced protection of the plasmid
from the degrading action of the DNase I enzyme, as pointed by the
more intense fluorescence detected in the gels at α = 0.5 compared
to that observed at α = 0.2 (Figure 2). Second, the pDNA molecules reduce the
interface tension of the lipids more effectively at moderate lipid
compositions, thus favoring more deformable lipid membranes. This
feature, together with a larger accumulation of positive charges at
α = 0.5, may promote the formation of multilayer structures,
in agreement with the SAXS and cryo-TEM results (Figure 5) and also with the higher
hydrodynamic sizes found for the lipoplexes at α = 0.5 than
at α = 0.2 (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information). Finally, the pDNA–mixed lipid nanostructures
seem to experience enhanced mobility at moderate lipid compositions,
which may, in turn, favor the efficiency of the transfection process.
This feature correlates well the slightly better TEs observed for
lipoplexes at α = 0.5 compared to those at α = 0.2 (Figure 3).

(t = 0 min) and

(b) α = 0.5. The Z scale bar is 20 nm.

Conclusions
It can therefore be
concluded that the cationic lipid C6C22C6 (with a hybrid structure between those
of a gemini lipid and a BA lipid) mixed with DOPE and a plasmid DNA
forms lipoplexes displaying a multilamellar nanostructure (Lα) with sizes in the range of 100–200 nm and low polydispersities,
very suitable for its durability in the bloodstream (a key property
for in vivo studies) and to cross the cell membrane (very important
in transfection processes). The ability of the C6C22C6/DOPE nanosystem to compact, protect (from the
degrading effect of DNase I), and transfect two DNA plasmids with
different characteristics into COS-7 cells has been demonstrated,
with an efficiency equal or even superior to that exhibited by the
universal control Lipo2000*, as long as the effective charge ratio
ρeff is maintained low. In addition, under these
conditions, the viability of COS-7 cells was maintained at levels
greater than 80%. Slightly better transfection performances were obtained
at moderate GBA lipid contents in the lipid mixture, correlated with
a better protection of the plasmid from the degrading action of the
DNase I enzyme and the enhanced mobility of the pDNA–mixed
lipid nanostructures at α = 0.5. In conclusion, C6C22C6/DOPE–pDNA lipoplexes are optimal
candidates for nonviral gene nanocarriers because of their low toxicity
and high biological activity in vitro, being therefore potentially
interesting candidates for in vivo experiments.

Experimental Section
Materials
1,22-Bis(hexyl dimethyl ammonium)docosane
(C6C22C6) was synthesized from the
corresponding α,α′-dibromide. 1,22-Dibromodocosane
was prepared by Kolbe electrolysis of 11-bromoundecanoic acid in methanol;
1,22-dibromodocosane (1.0 g) and anhydrous N,N-dimethyl hexyl amine (0.83 mL) in 50 mL of acetone were
boiled under reflux for 96 h. The material obtained after removal
of the solvent with a rotary evaporator was crystallized from ethanol–ether.
The obtained crystals were then dried in a vacuum desiccator at ambient
temperature to give the desired product (25% yield). 1H
NMR (300 MHz, D2O, 25 °C): δ = 3.28 (m, 8H),
δ = 3.11 (s, 12H), δ = 1.69 (brs, 8H), δ = 1.43–1.23
(m, 48H) and δ = 0.92 (m, 6H). MS (ESI): m/z calculated for [6-22-62+]2+, 283.83;
found, 283.829; calculated for [6-22-62+ Br–]+, 645.57; found, 645.579. The zwitterionic lipid DOPE
was purchased with highest purity from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.,
Alabaster, USA. The sodium salt of calf thymus DNA (ctDNA), as provided
by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA), was used as linear DNA to determine
the effective charge of the GBA cationic vector (C6C22C6). The pEGFP-C3 plasmid DNA (4700 bp) encoding
the GFP was extracted from competent Escherichia coli bacteria previously transformed with pEGFP-C3. The extraction was
carried out using a GenElute HP Select Plasmid Gigaprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich).
The pCMV-Luc VR1216 plasmid DNA (6934 bp) encoding luciferase (Clontech,
Palo Alto, USA) was amplified in E. coli and isolated and purified using a QIAGEN Plasmid Giga kit (QIAGEN
GMBH, Hilden, Germany). All reagents and solvents were of the highest
grade commercially available and used without further purification.

Preparation of Lipoplexes
Appropriate amounts of C6C22C6 and DOPE were dissolved in chloroform
to obtain the desired molar compositions of the cationic lipid (α)
in the lipid mixtures. After briefly vortexing the corresponding solutions,
the solvent was removed to yield dry lipid films. The resulting dry
lipid films were then hydrated with 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and homogenized
by means of a combination of vortexing and sonication. By a sequential
extrusion procedure explained in detail elsewhere,45,51 the multilamellar liposomes were transformed into the desired unilamellar
ones. Appropriate amounts of a stock solution of pDNA prepared the
day before were added to lipid suspensions to obtain the lipoplexes.
pDNA concentrations were chosen to fit the optimum conditions for
each experimental technique as follows: 1 mg/mL for zeta potential,
1 mg/mL for cryo-TEM, 200 μg/capillary (∼5 mg/mL) for
SAXS, and 1 μg/well (2 μg/mL) for biological studies.

Zeta Potential and Particle Size
The phase analysis
light scattering technique (Zeta PALS, Brookhaven Instruments Corp.,
Holtsville, USA) was employed to measure the electrophoretic mobility,
which was then used to obtain the zeta potential of the nanoaggregates.
The particle size was determined by a DLS method using a particle
analyzer (Zeta Nano Series; Malvern Instruments, Barcelona, Spain).
In both studies, samples were prepared with 40 mM HEPES buffer (pH
7.4) under experimental conditions of 25 °C, dispersant refractive
index of 1.33 (water), viscosity of 0.9 cP, and dispersant dielectric
constant of 78.5. Each zeta potential and particle size data point
was taken as the average of 50 and 30 independent measurements, respectively.
Measurements were carried out as a function of total lipid/DNA mass
ratio ((mL+ + mL0)/mDNA) and at
different molar fractions (α) of the cationic lipid in the GBA/DOPE
mixed lipids.

Gel Electrophoresis
DNA Compaction Assay
Lipoplexes along with uncomplexed
pDNA were loaded on 1% agarose gels (with 0.7 μL of GelRed)
and run for 30 min at 80 mV in 1× TAE buffer. Fully complexed
lipoplexes appeared as a fluorescence band in the wells of the gel,
whereas uncomplexed pDNA appeared outside the wells. The fluorescence
spectroscopy conditions were excitation at 302–312 nm and emission
at 600 nm. The fluorescence intensity of each band was measured using
the commercial Quantity One software and a Gel Doc XR instrument (Bio-Rad).

DNA Protection Assay
DNase I (1 U/μg pDNA) was
added to each mixed lipid sample and stirred for 30 min at 37 °C.
Then, 20 μL of 0.25 M EDTA was added to inactive DNase I, and
the samples were incubated for 15 min. Next, 15 μL of 25% SDS
was added and incubated for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed for
40 min under 80 mV in 1% agarose gel with 1 μL of EtBr. The
fluorescence spectroscopy conditions were excitation at 482 nm and
emission at 616 nm. The integrity of the plasmid at each composition
was compared with that of the untreated DNA as a control.

Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering
SAXS experiments were
carried out on a beamline NCD11 at the ALBA Synchrotron (Barcelona,
Spain). The energy of the incident beam was 12.6 keV (λ = 0.995
Å). Samples were placed in sealed glass capillaries. The scattered
X-rays were detected on a Quantum 210r CCD detector, converted to
one-dimensional scattering by radial averaging, and represented as
a function of momentum transfer vector. SAXS experiments were performed
for C6C22C6/DOPE–pDNA lipoplexes
at an effective charge ratio (GBA lipid/DNA) of ρeff = 4 and at several cationic lipid compositions of the mixed lipids,
α = 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.7. Measurements for each composition
were run in duplicate in two independent capillaries.

Cryo-TEM
Cryo-TEM experiments were carried out following
the standard procedure.53−55 In these experiments, perforated
Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 (a hole diameter of 1.2 μm) on a 400-mesh
copper grid was used. The images were obtained using a JEOL JEM 2011
cryo-electron microscope operated at 200 kV under low-dose conditions
and using different degrees of defocus (500–700 nm) to obtain
the adequate phase contrast. Images were recorded with a Gatan 794
Multiscan digital camera. Finally, the CCD images were processed and
analyzed with DigitalMicrograph. Cryo-TEM experiments were performed
with C6C22C6/DOPE–pDNA lipoplexes
at ρeff = 4 and at two cationic lipid compositions
in the mixed lipid, α = 0.2 and 0.5.

Atomic Force Microscopy
Supported planar bilayers for
AFM experiments were prepared as follows: 60 μL of a mixed lipid
sample with the desired composition in 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) was incubated
at 37 °C for 45 min on a freshly cleaved mica surface to ensure
liposome extension and subsequent formation of an SLB. After this
period, the sample was gently rinsed with buffer to eliminate all
nonadsorbed mixed lipids and mounted immediately on the top of the
AFM scanner. A minimum of 30 min was required to stabilize the sample
in the liquid to minimize any drift effects during scanning. AFM intermittent
contact mode images in liquid at 24.0 ± 0.2 °C were obtained
using a commercial NanoScope IV MultiMode microscope (Bruker, AXS
Corporation, Madison, USA) with MSNL-10 silicon tips with a nominal
spring constant of 30 pN/nm. The individual spring constants of the
cantilevers were measured using the thermal tune method, yielding
values similar to the nominal spring constant value. During scanning,
the vertical force was maintained at the minimum value, maximizing
the amplitude set point value while keeping the vibration amplitude
as low as possible. Images were scanned at a scan angle of 0°
and a scan rate of 1.5 Hz. After injection of a pDNA solution (0.1
μg/μL) and scanning of the first image, the tip was retracted
from the surface of the sample until the next image was obtained to
exclude side effects due to the proximity of the tip to the SLB. All
images were processed by the NanoScope Analysis software (Bruker AXS
Corporation, Santa Barbara, USA).

Cell Culture
COS-7
(African green monkey kidney) cells
(American Type Collection, Rockville, USA) were maintained at 37 °C
under 5% CO2 in a complete medium constituted by Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium—high glucose + GlutaMAX (Gibco BRL Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL).

In Vitro TE
Two methods were used to evaluate the TE:
luminometry for the pDNA encoding luciferase and FACS for the pDNA
encoding the GFP. In both methods, each measurement was carried out
in triplicate in three wells from three independent cultures. Lipofectamine
(Lipo2000*) was used as the positive control (1.5 μL of Lipo2000*/μg
of DNA).

Luminometry
Cells were seeded in a complete medium
in 48-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The medium was then removed, and 0.3 mL of the same medium
and 0.2 mL of the complexes were added to each well. After 4 h of
incubation, the medium was replaced by a complete medium and the cells
were further incubated for 48 h in a medium containing 10% FBS. The
cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysate
with 100 μL of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, USA)
at room temperature for 10 min, followed by two freeze–thaw
cycles. The lysate cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 12 000g to pellet the debris. Then, 20 μL of the supernatant
was assayed for total luciferase activity using the luciferase assay
reagent (Promega). A luminometer (Sirius-2, Berthold Detection Systems,
Innogenetics, Diagnóstica y Terapéutica, Barcelona,
Spain) was used to measure the luciferase activity. The protein content
of the lysates was measured by the DC protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Data
are expressed as nanograms of luciferase per milligrams of protein.

Fluorescence-Assisted Cell Sorting
Cells were seeded
in a medium in 48-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C
in 5% CO2. The medium was removed, and 200 μL of
trypsin (1×) was added to each well. After 2 min of incubation
at 37 °C, 400 μL of complete medium was added to neutralize
the trypsin. The samples were transferred to cytometer tubes and centrifuged
for 5 min at 1450 rpm and 4 °C. Finally, the pellets were resuspended
in 500 μL of a buffer containing PBS with 0.5% BSA and 2.5 mM
EDTA. Then, cells were sorted using a flow cytometer. FACS analysis
was performed using a Calibur 345 cytometer equipped with a 488 nm
laser and the BD CellQuest Pro software. The cells were first gated
using a forward scatter versus side scatter strategy to exclude any
debris (low events) and then specifically analyzed by their 530 nm
emission (FL1-H channel; the axis FL1-H shows the relative intensity
of the GFP fluorescence). The data were analyzed using the FlowJo
LLC data software. TEs were quantified by means of the percentage
of GFP cells, that is, the percentage of cells in which GFP expression
was observed, and the average intensity of fluorescence per cell (MFI).

Cell Viability
The cell viability was quantified by
a modified alamarBlue assay. Briefly, 1 mL of 10% (v/v) alamarBlue
dye in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium, supplemented with
10% (v/v) FBS medium, was added to each well 48 h after transfection.
After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 200 μL of the supernatant
was assayed by measuring the absorbance at 570 and 600 nm. Wells containing
medium and alamarBlue dye without cells were used as blanks. The cell
viability was calculated according to the following formula: (A570 – A600)treated cells × 100/(A570 – A600)control cells. Each sample was measured in three independent wells, and Lipo2000*
was used as the positive control (1.5 μL of Lipo2000*/μg
of DNA).
