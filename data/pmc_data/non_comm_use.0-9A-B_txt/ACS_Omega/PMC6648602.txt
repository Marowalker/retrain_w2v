A new
olefination protocol utilizing ethyl bromoacetate was highlighted,
in which magnesium enolate of the ester coupled with C20 dialdehyde 6, and double eliminations of the protected
hydroxyl groups and bromine atoms of the coupling bromohydrin product,
efficiently produced norbixin 1 after concomitant hydrolysis
of the ester. A new (C7 + C10 + C7) disconnection approach was demonstrated for the synthesis of norbixin
ethyl ester 2 by the Julia–Kocienski olefination
of novel C7 benzothiazolyl-sulfone 11 and
C10 2,7-dimethyl-2,4,6-octatrienedial (12).

Introduction
Annatto is a natural
colorant used for dying the yellow to orange
color of cheddar cheese and has been widely used for coloring other
foodstuffs such as sausage, salmon, candy, confectionery, beverage,
butter and margarine, and even for cosmetics.1 The annatto colorant is extracted from the seed of the tropical
bush Bixa orellana, which is ubiquitous
in a large part of South America. The seed contains ∼5% of
the colorant, which mostly comprises carotenoids, and 80% of that
is bixin.2 Bixin is hydrolyzed during extraction
with alkaline aqueous solution to give norbixin 1, which
shows the structural feature of a conjugated polyene acid; this endows
the natural dye with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.3 Unlike the general belief that this red pigment
has good water solubility, it is only sparsely soluble in water, which
allowed the isolation of the polar carotenoid by extraction from an
aqueous acidic solution.4

The organic
synthesis of norbixin ethyl ester 2 was
reported by the Wittig olefination of C20 crocetin dialdehyde 4 with phosphorus ylide 3 (79% yield),5 derived from ethyl bromoacetate (5c) (Figure 1). However,
preparation of the fully conjugated crocetin dialdehyde 4(6) was even more challenging, and the best
yield so far was only 21–24% from furan.6b We demonstrated that C20 dialdehyde 6, which can be succinctly prepared by double allylic oxidation of
the coupling product between geranyl sulfone and geranyl bromide (54%
yield in five steps from geraniol), is an excellent substitute for
the fully conjugated version 4 in the sulfone olefination
protocol.7 It was thus envisioned that
the sulfone-mediated olefination between α-benzenesulfonyl ester 5a(8) and C20 dial 6 would produce norbixin ester or norbixin. Unfortunately,
the bulky and stabilized ester enolate of 5a or 5b(9) containing phenyl sulfide did
not produce any coupling product with C20 dialdehyde 6. Searching for a proper anion-stabilizer X, which would
induce the coupling reaction with aldehydes and also serve as a leaving
group in the next stage, ethyl bromoacetate (5c) itself
was investigated for the olefination with C20 dial 6.

their synthetic strategies.

Results and Discussion
Ethyl bromoacetate (5c) has been used as a nucleophile
by activated zinc in the Reformatsky reaction,10 in which bromine atom was used for the Zn-enolate formation
of ester and removed during the coupling reaction with aldehydes.
A strong metal-amide base was necessary to generate α-bromoenolate
from 5c, and the covalency of the counter metal–oxygen
bond was also important to avoid epoxidation of the coupled bromohydrin
product. The coupling reaction between 5c and C20 dialdehyde 6 was carefully studied with a strong base
with several counter metal ions (Table 1).

a The reaction was carried out with
1 mmol of dialdehyde 6 and 5 equiv of ethyl bromoacetate
(5c) and 5 equiv of the additive, where it is applicable.

b No reaction, and starting dial 6 was recovered.

The enolate generated from 5c by LDA reacted with 6 at −78 °C to give the desired bromohydrin 7 in 46% yield together with mono- and diepoxide products 8 and 9 in 13% and 7% yields, respectively (Figure 2 and Table 1, entry 1). Even though only
one monoepoxide product 8 was shown in Figure 2 for clarity, the other monoepoxide
might be formed. These products, 7, 8, and 9, were separable in thin-layer chromatography, but full characterization
of each peak in 1H NMR spectra was difficult due to the
presence of stereoisomers from five chiral centers. Nevertheless,
identification of each product was possible by confirmation of the 1H NMR peaks at 4.15−4.46 ppm for bromohydrin and at
3.42–3.53 ppm for epoxide (see 1H NMR spectra in Supporting Information). The result that α-bromine
induced the coupling reaction of the ester enolate with aldehyde and
survived for the next olefination reaction was a stimulating finding.

Figure 2 Intermediate
structures in norbixin synthesis from ethyl bromoacetate
(5c) and C20 dial 6.

Optimization of the coupling reaction was necessary
to decrease
the epoxidation products 8 and 9 of the
initial bromohydrin coupling product 7, which did not
produce norbixin under base-promoted elimination conditions. Almost
the same result was obtained for the reaction utilizing less basic
LiHMDS (Table 1, entry
2). It was interesting to note that no coupling product was obtained
when potassium metal was used for the HMDS base (entry 3). Next, boron
and magnesium enolates were produced by a metal-exchange reaction
from the initially formed Li-enolate utilizing LDA and subjected to
the coupling reaction with C20 dial 6. When
BF3·OEt2 was used to generate the B-enolate,
the reaction did not provide any coupling products and dial 6 was recovered (entry 4). On the other hand, the Mg-enolate,
which was generated either by (i-Pr2N)2Mg or by MgBr2, successfully produced the bromohydrin
coupling product 7 exclusively in 76–77% yields
without epoxidation even at room temperature (entries 5 and 6).

Olefination can be performed by OH-protection of bromohydrin 7, followed by base-promoted elimination of all of the internal
hetero-functional groups to provide the fully conjugated polyene diester.
Methoxymethyl, 1-ethoxyethyl, and tetrahydropyranyl groups were generally
used for the protection of the hydroxyl group in the double-elimination
protocol.11 Protection of bromohydrin 7 by ethyl vinyl ether with catalytic PPTS in CH2Cl2 produced 1-ethoxyethyl ether 10, which
underwent an elimination reaction by excess KOMe (30 equiv) in refluxing
benzene and cyclohexane to directly produce norbixin 1 (Figures 1 and 2). Hydrolysis of esters was accompanied by this
olefination reaction.

The resulting potassium salt of norbixin
was completely soluble
in the alkaline solution. The reaction mixture was acidified, and
organic byproducts were removed by thorough extraction with Et2O. Norbixin was then extracted with CH2Cl2 from the acidified aqueous solution. The undissolved red-brown solid
in the aqueous layer, which was also identified as pure norbixin,
was combined. The total yield of norbixin 1 was 82% (two
steps from bromohydrin 7), which was further purified
by recrystallization from acetone or CH2Cl2. The
efficient bromoacetate olefination protocol with C20 dial 6 thus provided norbixin 1 in 63% yield (three
steps), which accounted for 35% of the overall yield (eight steps)
from the beginning geraniol.

Synthesis of norbixin ethyl ester 2 was next challenged
by the Julia–Kocienski olefination of novel benzothiazolyl
(BT) sulfone 11 and C10 dialdehyde 12(12) (Scheme 1). Julia–Kocienski olefination is the advanced
version of the Julia sulfone olefination protocol, in which BT-sulfone
(or tetrazol-5-yl sulfone) can be utilized in the coupling with aldehydes
to directly produce the olefination products through the Smiles rearrangement
instead of the three-step sequence of coupling, protection, and elimination
of the original protocol.13 Dienyl BT-sulfone 11 was designed for the quick assembly of the symmetrical
conjugated polyenyl esters. The Wittig reaction of the reported C5 BT-sulfide 13(6d) with
phosphorus ylide 3, prepared from ethyl bromoacetate
(5c), produced the chain-extended C7 dienyl
BT-sulfide 14 (91% yield). Oxidation of sulfide 14 by monoperphthalic acid, prepared in situ from phthalic
anhydride and urea-H2O2 in acetonitrile, produced
the corresponding all-(E)-dienyl BT-sulfone 11 (81% yield).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Norbixin Ethyl Ester 2 by Julia–Kocienski
Olefination
Julia–Kocienski
olefination of BT-sulfone 11 was sensitive to the reaction
conditions, especially the selection
of the base. LiHMDS, NaHMDS, KHMDS, t-BuOK, and Cs2CO3 were all no good in promoting Julia–Kocienski
olefination with C10 dial 12. However, DBU
worked out well for this olefination as Blakemore reported in the
synthesis of conjugated unsaturated esters from BT-sulfonyl acetate.14 The Julia–Kocienski olefination of BT-sulfone 11 and C10 dialdehyde 12 was thus
performed with DBU in CH2Cl2 at 25 °C to
produce mostly the mono-olefination product 15, in which
an all-(E)-configuration was observed presumably
due to the effective conjugation with an aldehyde. The best yield
of 15 (70%) was obtained when 2 equiv of BT-sulfone 11 was used. The mono-olefination product 15 was
still the major product (53% yield) even when 4 equiv of BT-sulfone 11 was used. Norbixin ethyl ester 2 was directly
obtained in only 12% yield by double olefination in this case. The second Julia–Kocienski
olefination of the mono-olefination product 15 and BT-sulfone 11 (2 equiv) with DBU as the base produced the all-(E)-norbixin ethyl ester 2 in 70% yield, which
accounted for an overall yield of 2 of 36% in four steps
from the conjugated aldehyde 13.

Conclusions
Two
practical synthetic methods for norbixin 1 and
its ethyl ester 2 were developed. Ethyl bromoacetate
can be utilized in the olefination reaction with C20 dialdehyde 6 to produce C24 norbixin 1 through
magnesium enolate, bromohydrin formation by coupling, and double eliminations
of the protected hydroxyl groups and bromine atoms of the bromohydrin
product. This protocol utilized an alcoholic base for elimination
and induced the concomitant hydrolysis of esters, which fitted well
with the direct preparation of norbixin. The overall yield of norbixin 1 was 35% in eight steps from readily available geraniol.

New C7 BT-sulfone 11 was devised for Julia–Kocienski
olefination with C10 dialdehyde 12 to produce
C24 norbixin ethyl ester 2, in which DBU promoted
the olefination under a mild condition without the hydrolysis of esters.
Norbixin ethyl ester 2 was obtained in 36% yield after
four steps from aldehyde 13. These two concise and practical
synthetic protocols enriched the synthetic repertoires of the polar
functionalized carotenoids with wide biological and industrial applications.

[Method A: from 15]: To a stirred
solution of BT-sulfone 11 (1.07 g, 3.04 mmol, 2 equiv)
and the monocoupled product 15 (0.46 g, 1.53 mmol) in
CH2Cl2 (40 mL), DBU (0.60 g, 3.97 mmol) was
slowly added under an argon atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at
room temperature for 24 h and quenched with 10% NH4Cl solution.
The mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2, dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by SiO2 flash column chromatography (5% EtOAc in hexanes) to give
norbixin ethyl ester 2 (0.47 g, 1.07 mmol) in 70% yield

(1.01 g, 6.68 mmol) was slowly added under an argon atmosphere. The
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h and quenched with
10% NH4Cl solution. The mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude
product was purified by SiO2 flash column chromatography
(5–15% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the monocoupled product 15 (0.24 g, 0.80 mmol) and norbixin ethyl ester 2 (80 mg, 0.18 mmol) in 53 and 12% yields, respectively, as deep-red
powders.
