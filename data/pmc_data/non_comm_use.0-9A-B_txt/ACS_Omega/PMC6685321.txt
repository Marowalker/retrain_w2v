There has been a trend toward the
use of microorganisms as the
biomaterial for removing dyes and metals from wastewater. However,
native microorganism cells have low mechanical stability, which limit
their further application in industries. In this study, chlorine dioxide
(ClO2), a high-efficiency, low-toxicity, and environmentally
benign disinfectant, was used for microorganism surface modification
to enhance the mechanical stability and metal ion adsorption of the
cell. ClO2 can either modify cell walls to improve their
metal adsorption capacity or modify cell membranes to improve their
mechanical stability. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis
indicated that several cell surface groups were involved in the cell
wall modification of Bacillus sp. Microscopic
observation indicated that ClO2 treatment could deter cell
membranes from forming vesicles in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous
solution, and freeze-etching showed that ClO2 treatment
could alter the erythrocyte membrane proteins which might also contribute
to improving the cell stability. The experimental results on Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Mucor rouxii show that ClO2 treatment may increase, or at least not reduce, the ability
of microbial cells to adsorb heavy metals, but it can significantly
improve the resistance of these cells to NaOH cleavage. It seems ClO2 is a promising auxiliary for biosorption of heavy-metal ions.

1 Introduction
Both dyes and heavy metals
are common contaminants in industrial
wastewaters and many of them are known to be toxic and carcinogenic.1,2 Hence, effective and thorough methods for remediating dye- and metal-contaminated
water are urgently needed. Of the various techniques employed for
the treatment of dye- and metal-bearing industrial effluents, biosorption
has become a favorable biotic method of choice because of its environmentally
benign approach, good performance, low cost, and large available biomass
quantities.3−5

Many raw microorganisms have been reported
to be capable of accumulating
dyes and/or metals.2,3 However, further research has
revealed that cell biomass can be pretreated to improve cell adsorption
capacity by surface group modification.4 A number of methods have been employed for cell wall modification,
among which NaOH treatment has been widely used because of its positive
effect on biosorption.6−9 NaOH has also been used for desorption or pretreatment to regenerate
the biosorbents, thus playing an important role in their further industrial
application.10

However, NaOH has
an intense cell lysis effect on the cells of
many organisms. Yan observed that NaOH pretreatment resulted in a
dramatic increase in metal adsorption capacity of Mucor
rouxii and a significant reduction in biomass compared
to an autoclaved biomass control.9 Other
reagent treatments such as NaCO3, CaCl2, HCl,
and H3PO4 have also demonstrated a significant
cracking effect on M. rouxii cells.11 Dow and Rubery found that cell walls of M. rouxii could be ruptured using NaOH.12 Fourest and Volesky reported that up to a 39%
biomass loss could be achieved by pretreating Sargassum
fluitans with NaOH.13 The
mass loss of biomass during pretreatment may lead to some confusion
during the quantitative assessment of the bioadsorption performance.14 In addition, the poor mechanical stability of
the native microorganisms may have limited their further application
under real conditions.15,16 Hence, it is important to improve
the stability of microorganisms before their further application in
industries. As far as the authors know, immobilization was the only
method to improve the mechanical stability of the microorganisms.17

In the current study, Escherichia
coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus sp., M.
rouxii, and erythrocytes, which represent Gram-negative
bacteria, Gram-positive
bacteria, fungi, and animal cells, respectively, were treated by ClO2. We demonstrate that ClO2, a high-efficiency,
low-toxicity, and environmentally benign disinfectant, could be used
for Bacillus sp. B26 and M. rouxii modification to improve their metal adsorption
capacity. More importantly, we were very lucky to find out that ClO2 can modify different kinds of cell membranes to enhance their
stability in an aqueous NaOH solution. Therefore, ClO2 is
a promising regeneration aid for those who use NaOH to treat biosorbent
materials for regeneration but are trapped by the degradation of the
cells by NaOH.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Culture Media and Harvesting Techniques
Bacillus sp. (Gram-positive bacteria), E. coli (Gram-negative bacteria), P. aeruginosa(Gram-negative bacteria), and M. rouxii (fungus) were purchased from Guangdong
Microbial Culture Collection Center (GMCCC, China). The growth medium
for Bacillus sp. was prepared as described
by Xu,18 which contained maltose 10.0 g/L,
casein peptone 10.0 g/L, beef extract 5.0 g/L, and NaCl 2.0 g/L, and
was maintained at pH 7.2 and 32 °C with an agitation speed of
200 rpm in a rotating shaker.17 The growth
medium for M. rouxii contained 50.0
g/L glucose, 20.0 g/L casein peptone, 2.0 g/L yeast extract, 4.0 g/L
KH2PO4, and 2.0 g/L MgSO4, and was
maintained at pH 4.5 and 28 °C with an agitation speed of 300
rpm in a rotating shaker. The growth medium for E.
coli and P. aeruginosa contained 10.0 g/L casein peptone, 5.0 g/L yeast extract, and 10.0
g/L NaCl, and was incubated at pH 7.0 and 37 °C with an agitation
speed of 120 rpm in a rotating shaker. Cells were harvested at a suitable
time by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min at 4 °C
and washed three times with double-distilled water (ddH2O), and then resuspended with ddH2O at a concentration
of 109 CFU/mL for subsequent experiments. Erythrocytes
were harvested from rabbit flesh blood by adding 5 mL of flesh blood
to 0.4 mL EDTA-Na2 (15 g/L). The fresh erythrocytes were
washed three times with physiological saline and adjusted to 2% concentration
(v/v) for subsequent use.

2.2 Metal Ion Adsorption Experiments
on ClO2-Treated Cells
For the treatment of cells
with ClO2, the bacteria suspension of 1 mL was transferred
to a centrifuge
tube. Then, the tube was centrifuged to pellet the cells and discard
the supernatant completely. The cells were resuspended with 1 mL ClO2 solution (150 mg/L) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature.
After that, the cells were washed with ddH2O to remove
the residual ClO2.

Uranium is one of the most seriously
hazardous heavy metals because of its high toxicity and some radioactivity.
Considerable amounts of uranium have found their way into the environment
through the activities associated with the nuclear industry. Wet biomasses
(0.01 g or an equal cell-immobilized matrix) were added to 30 mL solutions
containing UO22+ (300 mg/L, for Bacillus), Cu2+ (300 mg/L, for P. aeruginosa), and Fe3+ (300 mg/L, for M. rouxii). The suspensions were incubated at 25
°C and pH 6.0 in a shaker at 180 rpm and sampled periodically.
The collected samples were centrifuged at 6000g for
10 min and the supernatant was then filtered through a 0.45 μm
cellulose membrane. The residual uranium on the filter was measured
with a micro-uranium analyzer with a detection range of 3.0 ×
10–11 to 2.0 × 10–5 g/mL
and a relative standard deviation of less than or equal to 8%. Atomic
adsorption spectrometry was used for detection of Cu2+ and
Fe3+.

2.3 Fourier Transform Infrared
Analysis of Bacillus sp. B26 Biomass
Suspensions (2
mL in each centrifuge tube) of Bacillus sp. B26 were centrifuged at 4 °C, 8000g for
5 min, the pellets were washed three times and resuspended in lyoprotective
solution, stored at −70 °C for 2 h, and then lyophilized
for 12 h. Lyophilized biomass samples were characterized using Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) analysis to better understand the modification
effect of ClO2 on Bacillus sp. cells. Infrared spectra of the pure/uranium-bearing and ClO2-treated lyophilized Bacillus sp. biomass samples were recorded in the range of 4000–400
cm–1 on a Nicolet FTIR spectrophotometer using KBr
pellets.

2.4 NaOH Cell Lysis Experiments
The cell
sediments of Bacillus sp., E. coli, M. rouxii, and erythrocyte were subjected to NaOH additions of different final
concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 mmol/L and shaken in suspension
for 10 min. The NaOH-treated cells were harvested by centrifugation
and resuspended in distilled water (physiological saline for erythrocytes),
and then subjected to cell concentration determination by detecting
OD600 values (by UV–vis spectrophotometry at 600
nm, Beijing Puxi TU-1810) for Bacillus sp. and E. coli, and using a hematocyte
counter for M. rouxii and erythrocyte.

2.5 Resistance of ClO2-Treated Cells
to NaOH
The cell sediments of E. coli, M. rouxii, and erythrocytes were
subjected to ClO2 additions of different final concentrations
ranging from 0 to 150 mg/L and shaken in suspension for 10 min. The
suspensions were centrifuged to remove residual ClO2, and
the obtained cell sediments were treated with NaOH (100 mmol/L) as
described in Section 2.4.

An addition experiment was carried out to observe
NaOH cracking effects on ClO2-treated erythrocytes: erythrocytes
were treated by ClO2, ClO2 and NaOH, and NaOH,
respectively; then, the suspensions were centrifuged to observe the
volumes of sediments. The control erythrocytes were suspended only
in normal saline, ClO2 and NaOH concentration herein is
130 mg/L and 100 mmol/L respectively (normal saline as
solvent).

2.6 Microscopic Observation and Freeze-Etching
of Erythrocytes
A drop of erythrocyte suspension was dropped
on the glass slide, and a cover slip was added. The prepared sample
was observed under a phase contrast microscope. For freeze-etch experiments,
the various fixed erythrocyte samples were frozen in liquid Freon
22 (−150 °C), transferred to liquid nitrogen, fractured,
and then etched at −100 °C for 4 min in a high-vacuum
evaporator (HUS-5GB) device, which was described by Wise,19 and observed under an H-600 transmission electron
microscope.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Effect of ClO2 Treatment on Metal
Adsorption by Different Microorganisms
The results of the
time course experiments that examined metal adsorption with and without
pretreatment with ClO2 are shown in Figure 1. Bacillus sp. showed considerable adsorption of UO22+ within the first 30 min for both pretreated and untreated cells.
Maximum adsorption is reached at about 120 min with an adsorption
quantity of about 316.0 mg/L for the control group and 422.0 g/L for
the ClO2-treated group. This demonstrated a 33.5% higher
UO22+ ion adsorption capacity for the ClO2-modified Bacillus sp. cells
relative to the control group. The adsorption capacity of M. rouxii for Fe3+ was 18.7% higher than
that of the control at 180 min, whereas no difference in adsorption
of Cu2+ by P. aeruginosa was observed between the experimental and control setups. Therefore, Bacillus sp. was chosen as the type of strain to
study the cell wall modification mechanism by FTIR analysis.

microorganisms. Bacillus sp.: UO22+; P. aeruginosa: Cu2+; M. rouxii: Fe3+ (error bars represent standard deviation).

As the biosorption process consists primarily of
cell surface sequestration,
the modification of cell walls can greatly alter the metal ion-binding
mechanism.20 The modification results may
show enhancement or reduction in metal bioadsorption, depending on
the fungal strains and treatment procedures used.9 The most widely used modification methods are heating,
inorganic treatment (e.g. acid or caustic soda), and organic treatment
(e.g. methanol or formaldehyde).7,21−23 However, chlorine dioxide, a promising disinfectant with high biocidal
effects and low toxicity, has not previously been investigated to
our knowledge. Compared to other pretreatment reagents, chlorine dioxide
is more economical and more environmentally friendly.

3.2 FTIR Analysis of Bacillus sp.
Experimental Samples
To examine the effect on binding
of metals in the presence and absence of ClO2, Fourier
transformed infrared spectra of Bacillus sp. B26 biomass of three treatment conditions, no treatment cells,
UO22+-loaded cells, and ClO2-treated
cells, were examined. As shown in Figure 2A, the spectrum of the native biomass showed
a characteristic peak in the 3749 cm–1 region because
of the stretching of the O–H bonds in the carboxylic acid groups
present in the biomass.24 In the UO22+-treated spectrum (Figure 2B), this peak was shifted to 3751 cm–1, which could be attributed to carboxylic acid binding
to UO22+. In the ClO2-treated spectrum
(Figure 2C), the O–H
stretching peak was shifted to 3743 cm–1, indicating
its contribution to affecting the UO22+ adsorption
by affecting the O–H bond of carboxylic acids. A peak in the
3280–3320 cm–1 (3307, 3311, and 3294 cm–1 for the no treatment, the UO22+-loaded, and the ClO2-treated cells, respectively) was
observed because of the stretching of the N–H bond of amino
groups. This N–H stretching peak lies in a region occupied
by a broad and strong band (3200–3500 cm–1) that is due to the presence of γO–H of the hydroxyl
groups.25 For both the UO22+-treated and ClO2-treated samples, changes in
the peak position and shape in these spectra indicated that ClO2 treatment may have influenced the binding of uranium with
amino and hydroxyl groups. In the control spectrum, the complex adsorption
at 2900–3000 cm–1 is ascribed to the asymmetric
stretching of the γC–H bonds in −CH2 groups combined with that of the CH3 groups.26 Both peak position and shape changed in these
regions for the UO22+-treated and ClO2-treated samples. In the control spectrum, the peak at 2974 cm–1 is a little more intense than the peak at 2933 cm–1, whereas the 2933 cm–1 peak is
more intense than the 2974 cm–1 peak for the UO22+-treated and ClO2-treated samples.
There is a small shift in peak position from 1730 to 1732 cm–1 for the UO22+-treated and ClO2-treated
samples relative to the control.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of Bacillus sp. B26
biomass. (A) No treatment cells; (B) UO22+-loaded
cells; (C) ClO2-treated cells.

All three spectra revealed the presence of protein-related
bands.
The γC=O of amide I (1700–1600 cm–1) and δNH/γC=O combination of amide II (1600–1500
cm–1) bonds were prominent at about 1653 and 1541
cm–1, respectively.27 Compared to the metal-free control cells and ClO2-treated
cells, the spectrum for the UO22+-treated samples
showed a shift in the position of the 1653 cm–1 peak
to 1651 cm–1, indicating that ClO2 treatment
had no influence on sorption of U to the γC=O bond within
amide I. The strong adsorption peaks between 1000 and 1100 cm–1 also indicated the presence of carboxyl groups in
the bacterial polysaccharide structure. After metal binding by the
biomass, minor changes in the peak position (1055 cm–1 in the control compared to 1057 cm–1 in the UO22+-treated and ClO2-treated spectra)
in this region strongly suggest the involvement of carboxyl groups
in U sorption and ClO2 treatment.27 In the UO22+-treated sample, the distinct
peak at 906 cm–1 could be assigned to the asymmetric
stretching vibration of ν3UO22+. All peaks in the 1540–1000 cm–1 region
were consistent in position across the three sample spectra.

3.3 Lysis Effects of the NaOH Solution on Erythrocytes, E. coli, M. rouxii, and Bacillus sp. Cells
In order to understand the preliminary lysis effects of NaOH on cells,
four kinds of cells, erythrocytes, E. coli, M. rouxii, and Bacillus sp., were treated with NaOH at different concentrations. As shown
in Figure 3, the erythrocytes
began to lyse when the NaOH concentration reached 2 mmol/L, and cracked
completely when NaOH concentration reached 5 mmol/L. A much higher
concentration of NaOH was required to crack E. coli, with only 23% lysis occurring at about 30 mmol/L. The lysis rate
for E. coli reached a maximum at about
95% when the NaOH concentration reached 50 mmol/L, an order of magnitude
higher than that observed for the erythrocytes. The maximum lysis
rate for M. rouxii was about 42% when
the NaOH concentration was above 50 mmol/L, and the NaOH (ranging
from 0 to 100 mmol/L) appeared to have no significance lysis effect
on Bacillus sp. cells.

Figure 3 Lysis effect of NaOH
on different cells (error bars represent standard
deviation).

These four cell types
were chosen for the lysis experiments because
they represent four different cell surface structures. Bacillus sp. are Gram-positive bacteria comprising
a thick peptidoglycan layer and E. coli are Gram-negative bacteria comprising a much thinner peptidoglycan
layer.4M. rouxii are fungal, and thus different from bacteria, and comprise primarily
chitin, glucan, mannan, and protein layers, depending upon the species.28 Erythrocytes are membrane-naked because of the
absence of a proper cell wall and are more vulnerable to the external
environment. The results showed that the susceptibility of cells to
NaOH lysis decreases in the following order: erythrocyte > E. coli > M. rouxii > Bacillus sp. Erythrocytes, E. coli, and M. rouxii were chosen for the following study.

3.4 Tolerance
of ClO2-Treated Cells
to Cracking by NaOH
As shown in Figure 4, the ClO2 treatments had no significant
influence on the cell concentration of any of the three cell types
tested. In all cases, the ClO2 treatment had a positive
dosage-dependent effect on the tolerance of cells to cracking by NaOH.
In the erythrocytes group (Figure 4C), the cells showed dramatic tolerance to NaOH when
the ClO2 concentration reached 30 mg/L, whereas E. coli (Figure 4A) and M. rouxii (Figure 4B) only showed initial
effects of ClO2 dosages at 60 and 90 mg/L, respectively.
When treated with ClO2 at 130 mg/L, about 80% of the E. coli and erythrocyte cells were resistant to cracking
by NaOH, whereas M. rouxii cells were
100% resistant.

(B) M. rouxii; (C) erythrocytes (error

Figure 5 shows
images
of the erythrocyte cell sediment samples after treatment with different
reagents and centrifugation. There was no significant difference between
the control group (Figure 5A) and ClO2-treated group (Figure 5B) with both displaying a white-transparent
supernatant. Figure 5D had no sediment, indicating that all the cells were cracked by
NaOH. The weak color in the Figure 5C supernatant may have resulted from partial cracking
of cells or leakage of hemoglobin after treatment by ClO2 and NaOH.

(130 mg/L); (C) ClO2 treatment (130 mg/L) and NaOH treatment
(100 mmol/L); (D) NaOH treatment (100 mmol/L).

It is of great interest that the ClO2-treated
cells
showed resistance to cracking by NaOH without cell species specificity.
Because all three cell types have a biofilm composed of a phospholipid
bilayer in common, it seems likely that the resistance results from
membrane alteration. Jacobsohn reported that high or low pH may decrease
the stability of biomembranes by exposing their hydrophobic domain
to the aqueous phase, leading to changes in the membrane from a bilayer
structure to micro-capsule structure.29 As erythrocytes are immune to cell wall interference and are more
visible under the microscope, samples of erythrocyte were observed
and analyzed by a phase contrast microscope, flow cytometry, and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) to explore the action mechanism of ClO2 on cell membranes.

3.5 Action Mechanism Analysis
Figure 6 shows the
phase
contrast microscope morphologies of erythrocytes treated with different
reagents. The surface gloss of the erythrocytes changed greatly after
ClO2 treatment (Figure 6A,B). Many cracking cells were observed after treatment
with 30 mg/L ClO2 followed by treatment with 100 mmol/L
NaOH (Figure 6C), which
also testify an aspect of morphology changes in that high pH values
may lead to changes in the membrane structure from a bilayer structure
to a micro-capsule structure.30 As shown
in Figure 6D, the extent
of cell vacuolation decreased notably after treatment with a high
concentration of ClO2 (130 mg/L).

ClO2 treatment (130 mg/L); (C) ClO2 treatment
(30 mg/L) and NaOH treatment (100 mmol/L); (D) ClO2 treatment
(130 mg/L) and NaOH treatment (100 mmol/L).

Flow cytometry was used to investigate and detect erythrocytes,
and two detectors were aimed at the point where the stream passes
through the light beam: a forward scatter (FS) detector in line with
the light beam and several side scatter (SS) detectors perpendicular
to the light beam. By analyzing fluctuations in brightness at each
detector, it is possible to derive information regarding the physical
and chemical structure of each individual particle. The FS brightness
generally has a positive relationship with cell volume and the SS
brightness depends on the complexity of the particle, such as the
membrane roughness. As shown in Figure 7, the average SS brightness of the erythrocytes increased
significantly with the increasing ClO2 dosage, which, to
some extent, indicates a change in membrane roughness. The average
FS brightness of the ClO2-treated erythrocytes decreased
relative to that of the control, indicating membrane constriction
after ClO2 treatment.

(A) No treatment; (B) ClO2 treatment (30 mg/L); (C) ClO2 treatment (130 mg/L).

Figure 8 shows
examples
of freeze-etched profiles of normal erythrocytes and ClO2-treated erythrocytes. The extracellular fracture face (EF) and protoplasmic
fracture face (PF) were distinguished according to their particle
intensity: sparse ones are EF faces and intense ones are PF faces.31 The protein particles in normal erythrocytes
(Figure 8A) were small
(about 10 nm in diameter), whereas the ClO2-treated protein
particles (Figure 8B) were 2–3 times larger, possible due to denaturation of
proteins in the particles by ClO2 treatment. Some of the
ClO2-treated nearby particles seem to clump together. The
above results suggested that ClO2 treatment can greatly
alter the erythrocyte membrane proteins, which may in some way contribute
to its resistance to NaOH cracking. These findings also indicated
that the cause for resistance of microorganisms to NaOH lysis may
be primarily related to cell membrane alterations.

PF: protoplasmic fracture face.

With regard to the molecular mechanisms, not much is known
about
organic by-products formed after ClO2 treatment. As ClO2 oxidizes proteins and lipids, membrane resistance to cracking
could be enhanced by the ways in which the structures of membrane
proteins and lipids are altered.32 Gierer
reported that in the ClO2 oxidation process, radical cation
intermediates form immediately after the elimination reaction and
the charge-transfer complex, during which chlorous acid and hypochlorous
acid are produced.33,34 It is well known that cross linking
of proteins and lipids happens during lipid peroxidation of cells,
which is mediated by free radicals.35 On
the basis of previously published results, two proposed reaction pathways
are presented in Scheme 1. In both proposed pathways, the cross-linking reactions are initiated
by a hydrogen elimination reaction. In pathway A, the alpha carbon
of the amino acid residue connects with the carbon of the amide bond.
In pathway B, the peroxidized fatty acid cross links to another free
radical containing a fatty acid through C–O bonds. Therefore,
cross linking does not necessarily result in adsorption loss relative
to other functional groups like −NH3 or −COOH,
but rather leads to an enhancement of the cell membrane adsorption
capacity.

Scheme 1 Two Proposed Molecular Reaction Pathways
4 Conclusions
This study presents the first report of ClO2 in its
use in microorganism surface modification. FTIR analysis indicated
that several cell wall groups were involved in cell wall modification
of Bacillus sp. When treated with NaOH,
NaOH had an intense lysis effect on erythrocytes and E. coli, a notable lysis effect on M. rouxii, but no lysis effect on Bacillus sp. In all cases, the ClO2 treatment
had a positive dosage-dependent effect of prevented lysis, increasing
the resistance of cells to lysis with NaOH. Microscopic observation
indicated that ClO2 treatment could deter membranes from
forming vesicles in NaOH solution. Flow cytometry analysis indicated
that constriction of erythrocyte membranes occurs after ClO2 treatment. Freeze-etching showed that ClO2 treatment
could greatly alter the erythrocyte membrane proteins which might
help improve the cell resistance to lysis by NaOH. These findings
demonstrate that ClO2 has great potential to be applied
in microorganism modification to improve their dyes and metal adsorption
capacity as well as enhance their stability.
