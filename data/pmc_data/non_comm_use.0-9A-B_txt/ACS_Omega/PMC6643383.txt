Currently, platinum group metals
play a central role in the electrocatalysis
of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Successful design and synthesis
of new highly active materials for this process mainly rely on understanding
of the so-called electrified electrode/electrolyte interface. It is
widely accepted that the catalytic properties of this interface are
only dependent on the electrode surface composition and structure.
Therefore, there are limited studies about the effects of the electrolyte
components on electrocatalytic activity. By now, however, several
key points related to the electrolyte composition have become important
for many electrocatalytic reactions, including the ORR. It is essential
to understand how certain “spectator ions” (e.g., alkali
metal cations) influence the electrocatalytic activity and what is
the contribution of the electrode surface structure when, for instance,
changing the pH of the electrolyte. In this work, the ORR activity
of model stepped Pt [n(111) × (111)] surfaces
(where n is equal to either 3 or 4 and denotes the
atomic width of the (111) terraces of the Pt electrodes) was explored
in various alkali metal (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) hydroxide solutions. The activity
of these electrodes was unexpectedly strongly dependent not only on
the surface structure but also on the type of the alkali metal cation
in the solutions with the same pH, being the highest in potassium
hydroxide solutions (i.e., K+ ≫ Na+ >
Cs+ > Rb+ ≈ Li+). A possible
reason for the observed ORR activity of Pt [n(111)
× (111)] electrodes is discussed as an interplay between structural
effects and noncovalent interactions between alkali metal cations
and reaction intermediates adsorbed at active catalytic sites.

1 Introduction
The successful development
of electrocatalysts strongly correlates
with a detailed understanding of processes happening at the electrode/electrolyte
interface.1−5 Platinum and platinum group metals play a crucial role in catalyzing
numerous reactions, and one of the electrocatalytic reactions of great
importance, particularly for energy conversion and storage systems,
is the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).6,7 Several factors
determine the overall activity and selectivity of Pt and platinum
group metals toward the ORR: the electrode surface composition,8−10 electrode surface structure,11−16 and the electrolyte composition. Certain approaches and methodologies
such as Sabatier-type volcano plots3,17−19 or so-called coordination–activity relations20 can in many cases provide a good explanation of the observed
catalytic activity trends for various electrode materials. There have
also been studies regarding the influence of electrolyte components,21−29 which is less understood. For example, in sulfuric acid, sulfate
anions form strongly adsorbed layers on Pt electrodes, hamper the
adsorption of ORR intermediates, and decrease the electrode activity
toward oxygen electroreduction in comparison with HClO4 electrolytes.30,31 On the other hand, in HClO4 media, it has been recently shown that perchlorate anions
can interact with OH species adsorbed at the platinum surface and
likely influence the ORR active sites.32,33 However, there
is much less understanding of how certain cation “spectator
species” (such as Na+ or K+), which are
widely used as components of supporting electrolytes, affect the ORR
activity at different pHs and how they interact with the electrocatalytic
surface sites.

There are at least two concurrent hypotheses
proposed to explain
changes in the electrocatalytic activity of metal electrodes, for
example, if one switches the electrolyte pH from acidic to alkaline.
The first hypothesis is that the activity of an electrocatalyst simply
depends on the pH of the electrolyte because of entropy barriers at
the electrified interface34 or due to structuring
in the electrical double layer35,36 and/or different solvation
effects.37 The second hypothesis is based
on a big role of noncovalent interactions between the electrocatalyst
active sites and spectator species, for instance, the alkali metal
cations.25,27 In the case of the ORR activity at Pt(111)
electrodes in different alkaline solutions, the highest activity was
observed in 0.1 M Cs+-containing solutions, and it was
suggested that Cs+ exhibits the weakest stabilization of
the ORR intermediate, OH*,25 leading to
a near-optimal OH-binding energy for Pt(111) surfaces.

Herein,
we demonstrate that the ORR activity of well-defined high-index
model surfaces of Pt[n(111) × (111)] [where n = 3 for Pt(331), or n = 4 for Pt(221),
and denotes the atomic width of the (111) terraces of the Pt electrodes
with (111) step types] is significantly influenced by different alkali
metal cations, namely, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+. The particular choice of these
electrodes for this study is due to their exceptionally high ORR activities
in HClO4 media.21,38 We compared the results
obtained for the above-mentioned stepped single-crystal surfaces with
the similar ones for Pt(111) electrodes known from the literature.
The highest activity for the Pt(331) and Pt(221) electrodes was observed
in K+-containing electrolytes. However, the activities
of the high-index Pt surfaces appeared to be systematically lower
in alkaline than in acidic media, which is opposite to what is observed
for Pt(111) electrodes. The influence of the alkali metal cations
on the active sites located at the steps and terraces of Pt(331) and
Pt(221) electrodes is discussed.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Electrochemical Measurements
in Acidic and
Various Basic Solutions
Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of stepped
Pt(221) and Pt(331) single crystals were recorded in Ar-saturated
acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The resulting CVs in perchloric
acid solutions are shown in Figure 1A; CVs of Pt(111) single-crystal electrodes in 0.1
M HClO4 and 0.1 M KOH are also presented as a reference.
The voltammograms of stepped surfaces demonstrate distinctive features,
which are associated with different surface structures and the distribution
of adsorption sites as compared to Pt(111).21−23,43−45

Figure 1 (A) Typical CVs of Pt(221) and Pt(331)
electrodes obtained in Ar-saturated
0.1 M HClO4 together with the reference voltammogram for
Pt(111) in 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.1 M KOH as indicated in the
figure. Representative single-crystal surface structures are also
shown for clarity. Typical CVs of (B) Pt(221) and (C) Pt(331) electrodes
in Ar-saturated 0.1 M AM–OH (AM = Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) electrolytes.
The scan rate is 50 mV/s.

For all three electrodes, CVs obtained in 0.1 M HClO4 consist of clearly distinguishable regions with pairs of
reversible
peaks (Figure 1A).
In the case of Pt(111), adsorption/desorption of the underpotentially
deposited hydrogen species can be revealed between ∼0.1 and
∼0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Within the
same potential range, CV features in 0.1 M HClO4 are significantly
different for the Pt(221) and Pt(331) electrodes as compared to that
for Pt(111). Additional peaks appear at ca. 0.12 V versus RHE, which
are attributed to the adsorption of OH species on undercoordinated
sites at steps.39,40 Notably, in 0.1 M alkaline electrolytes
(Figure 1B,C), the
CVs in the potential region between ∼0.1 and ∼0.4 V
versus RHE for Pt(221) and Pt(331) are also considerably different:
the sharp peaks are shifted toward ∼0.25 V versus RHE. These
peaks can in principle be attributed to the adsorption/desorption
of the hydroxide species. However, there is no conclusive experimental
study confirming the nature of the adsorption species involved in
these processes in alkaline media. Most of the relevant studies were
carried out under ultrahigh vacuum conditions and did not consider
the influence of metal cations and other ions present in actual experimental
solutions (see ref (41)). Recently, Koper et al. suggested that coadsorption of cations
is the origin of the apparent pH dependence of hydrogen adsorption
on stepped Pt single-crystal electrodes.27

At the potential range between ∼0.35 and ∼0.65
V
versus RHE, the so-called double-layer region is observed (Figure 1), the width of which
is, however, noticeably different for Pt electrodes in acidic and
alkaline media. At the potential region more positive than ∼0.65
V versus RHE, even more drastic changes in the voltammetric behavior
are observed. Whereas for Pt(111), the reversible peaks related to
the OH adsorption at terraces are clearly observed between ∼0.6
and ∼0.9 V versus RHE, the hydroxyl anions adsorb significantly
weaker at similar sites of Pt(221) and Pt(331) electrodes. Notably,
the positive OH shift is more pronounced in the alkaline electrolyte.
Summarizing this part, it is important to admit that changes in the
electrolyte pH and composition drastically alter the adsorption properties
of Pt electrodes and would also likely influence the electrocatalytic
activity of these systems.

The ORR activities of stepped Pt(221)
and Pt(331) single crystals
were studied under the hanging meniscus rotating-disk electrode (HM-RDE)
configuration in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 and
0.1 M AM–OH (AM = Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) electrolytes. Typical anodic
polarization curves for Pt(221) are shown in Figure 2A. In Figure 2B, we show the activities of the Pt(221) electrodes
in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.1 M KOH and
for Pt(111) electrodes in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.1 M CsOH electrolytes taken from the study of Marković
et al.25 for benchmarking.

Pt(221) electrodes in O2-saturated
0.1 M AM–OH (AM = Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) electrolytes. The scan speed
was set to 50 mV/s, and the electrode was rotated at 1600 rpm. (B) iR-corrected RDE voltammograms of the Pt(221) electrodes

ref (25)). (C) Model
illustrating the location of the most active catalytic ORR centers
at the surface of Pt(221) in perchloric acid according to our previous
work (see ref (38)).
These centers have an optimal coordination in terms of so-called generalized
coordination numbers20 and are consequently
close to optimal binding toward the most important ORR intermediate,
OH*. Oxygen atoms, which permanently block the undercoordinated sites
at Pt(221), are represented as red spheres. Blue and black spheres
represent the hydrogen and platinum atoms, respectively.

It was reported that Pt(221) electrodes demonstrated
the highest
oxygen reduction activity among Pt single crystals in the 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte.21,38 In accordance with those results,
stepped Pt(221) crystals indeed show higher activity compared to Pt(111)
in acid (Figure 2B).
The reason for the increased ORR activity of Pt(221) is the maximal
density of surface catalytic sites with optimal coordination (in terms
of generalized coordination numbers)20,42 and consequently
the optimal binding toward the most important ORR intermediate, OH*,
as discussed in detail in ref (38). The most active ORR catalytic sites are “on-top”
sites located close to the concavities at steps, where the binding
to OH intermediates is ca. 0.093 eV weaker than that of the “on-top”
sites located at extended Pt(111) surfaces (Figure 2C).

For pristine Pt(111), the ORR activity
increases when the electrolyte
is switched from the acidic to some alkaline 0.1 M AM–OH (AM
= K+ and Cs+) electrolytes. It increases monotonously
from Li+- to Cs+-containing solutions, and the
activity of Pt(111) electrodes is significantly higher in 0.1 M CsOH
than that in 0.1 M HClO4 (Figure 2B).25 Marković
et al. suggested that the monotonous increase in the activity from
Li+ to Cs+ is a direct consequence of less OH
stabilization at (111) terraces of Pt(111) electrodes by “less-solvated”
Cs+ (and K+) ions compared to Li+.25 Interestingly, in contrast to Pt(111),
the opposite is observed for Pt(221) and Pt(331) electrodes: the ORR
activity is systematically higher for the stepped surfaces in the
acidic electrolyte compared to the basic ones, as summarized in Figure 3. Our data are also
consistent with the study by Rizo et al.23 where the ORR activities of stepped single crystals were lower in
0.1 M NaOH compared to that in the acidic solutions. In general, the
Pt(221) electrodes demonstrated higher ORR activities than Pt(331)
in all the basic electrolytes. The highest ORR activity for both stepped
single-crystal electrodes was observed in KOH in the following order:
K+ ≫ Na+ > Cs+ > Rb+ ≈ Li+.

densities for Pt(331)
and Pt(221) electrodes in 0.1 M AM–OH (AM = Li+,

electrolytes at the reference electrode potential 0.9 V versus RHE.
Dotted lines specify the activity of Pt(111) in 0.1 M HClO4, 0.1 M KOH, and Pt(221) in 0.1 M HClO4 for comparison.

Furthermore, Figure 4A shows the comparison of the
CVs of Pt(221) in 0.1 M LiOH and KOH
electrolytes. In the K+-containing solution, compared to
Li+-containing electrolytes, the adsorption of OH species
and oxide formation are observed at more positive potentials, and
the shape of the peak observed is slightly different, possibly because
of the different coverages of OH/O* species. Similar trends are observed
for the Pt(331) electrodes (Figure 4B). Because the OH species are also important ORR intermediates,
clearly not only pH but also the nature of the alkali metal cations
influence the properties of the adsorption sites (catalytic centers)
at the surfaces of high-index Pt single crystals, similar to the case
of Pt(111).25 Summarizing the observations
from Figures 1–4, one can assume that the observed activity of different
Pt electrodes in alkaline media is a result of the interplay between
structural effects and noncovalent interactions between alkali metal
cations and reaction intermediates adsorbed at active catalytic centers.

2.2 Influence of Alkali Metal
Cations on the ORR
Activity of High- and Low-Index Pt Electrodes
Activity measurements
for high-index Pt electrodes raise curiosity about the role of alkali
metal cations on the electrocatalyst active sites and what is the
role of the surface structure in the resulting ORR activity in alkaline
media. In other words, why introduction of steps increases the activity
in acidic media and decreases it when in basic solutions in the presence
of the alkali metal cations? We address this query in this section
by considering varying influences of alkali metal cations on different
active sites present at the surface of Pt electrodes in question.

There are nonequivalent OH-adsorption sites at the surface of Pt(111)
electrodes and the stepped single-crystal Pt surfaces, as schematically
shown in Figure 5A,B.
The OH-binding energies for these types of adsorption sites for Pt(111)
and Pt(221) surfaces are summarized in Table 1. These adsorption sites can also be considered
as the most probable catalytic centers for the oxygen electroreduction.
Taking a closer look at Figure 5A, one can see that for the Pt(111) surface, only one type
of “on-top” sites is possible (designated as type 1
in Figure 5A). For
the “on-top” centers at the Pt(111) surfaces in acidic
media, the corresponding OH-binding energy is ca. 0.1 eV stronger
than the optimal one (ΔEOH –
ΔEOH(optimum) value for type 1 in Table 1).

Alkali metal cations
seem to have another peculiar effect on the
amount of the OH adsorbed on the Pt(111) surface; the amount of OH
adsorbates seems to increase in the presence of alkali metal cations,
namely, K+ (Figure 5C,D). OH-adsorption isotherms for Pt(111) electrodes in 0.1
M HClO4 and 0.1 M KOH are shown in Figure 5C. Additionally, the OH-adsorption isotherms
normalized by maximal surface coverages are shown in Figure 5D. The surface coverages in
respective electrolytes were obtained by calculating the area (charge)
under the peaks (anodic parts) at the potentials between ∼0.55
and ∼0.85 V versus RHE from the CVs of Pt(111) in HClO4 and KOH shown in Figure 1A. In KOH solution, the obtained maximum coverage OH
charges are ∼2-fold higher than that in HClO4. This
observation could be explained by considering repulsive and attractive
forces between the same and oppositely charged molecules. Because
hydroxide molecules have repulsive forces between each other, they
cannot form a densely packed layer on the Pt(111) surface. However,
the presence of positively charged metal cations seems to alleviate
those repulsive forces. Because only reversible OH adsorption occurs
on the Pt(111) surfaces in alkaline media,43 one can assume that all adsorbed OH will participate in the reaction.
That is why the increased amount of adsorbed intermediates would directly
result in higher ORR activity, as observed for Pt(111) in alkaline
solutions.

Moreover, for the Pt(221) electrodes, there are more
nonequivalent
“on-top” locations as represented in Figure 5B; that is why the same above-mentioned
behavior in alkaline solutions is not observed for the high-index
stepped Pt surfaces. It seems that the nonuniform surface of Pt(221),
Pt(331) (steps and terraces as shown in Figure 5B,E) and the presence of several “on-top”
active sites inhibit/hinder the occurrence of the similar phenomena
in alkaline solutions. In order to clarify this, we should consider
structural and energetic characteristics of stepped Pt(221) and Pt(331)
surfaces. For the sake of simplicity, let us consider four types of
surface sites on Pt(221) (each corresponding to one of the four atoms
on the width of the (111) terraces of the Pt electrodes).

There
are two sacrificial surface sites: the first are permanently
blocked undercoordinated sites located on the top edges (Figure 5B) and the second
are hindered sites labeled as type 3 in Figure 5B. The existence of these sacrificial sites
is necessary for creating the highly active sites, shown as type 2
(Figure 5B). In acidic
media, the type 2 sites of Pt(221), as mentioned earlier, demonstrate
the most optimal OH-binding energy for the intermediates and are responsible
for the high ORR activity.

In other words, when there is only
relatively moderate influence
from the electrolyte components (like in perchloric acid media), the
site with an optimum binding energy is type 2 site on the Pt(221)
surface, which binds the OH intermediates only ca. 0.0075 eV stronger
than the optimum (see Table 1).

In the presence of alkali metal cations (in alkaline
solutions),
their prominent effects on the type 2 sites divert their OH-binding
energy from the near-optimal values. As a result, one always observes
lower ORR activity of the stepped Pt electrodes in basic electrolytes
compared to that in the acidic ones. Additionally, the reason why
Pt(331) shows lower activity compared to Pt(221) in the basic electrolytes
could be due to the absence of type 4 sites on Pt(331). The type 4
sites on the Pt(221) surface are similar to the type 1 sites of Pt(111)
(see Figure 5A,B),
and a comparable behavior (discussed above) in alkaline solutions
can be assumed.

There is another peculiarity, which distinguishes
the high-index
single-crystal Pt surfaces from Pt(111) in alkaline media, apart from
the fact that the ORR activity of Pt(221) and Pt(331) is systematically
lower than that in HClO4. The ORR activities of Pt(221)
and Pt(331) are nonlinear functions of the hydration energy of the
alkali metal cations (Figure 3), in contrast to almost a linear relation between these parameters
for Pt(111). According to the model proposed in ref (25), the hydrated alkali metal
cations should interact with the hydroxide ions adsorbed on the surface
via hydrogen bonds. The model assumes that alkali metal cations do
not lose their solvation shell and stay intact. Our findings on the
influence of different alkali metals on stepped Pt surfaces are mostly
consistent with that proposed model25 for
Pt(111). A schematic description of how the alkali metal cations can
interact with different adsorption sites at the Pt(221) surface is
shown in Figure 5E,
where possible three interactions of solvated alkali metal cations
with the Pt(221) active sites are depicted. Furthermore, in contrast
to the planar Pt(111) surface, where the cations can interact with
the whole first water layer unhindered, for stepped surfaces the step
edges can shield the terrace depending on the size of the solvated
metal cations. This shielding occurs because of the steric hindrance
resulting from the neighboring Pt atoms at the steps on the platinum
surface, which prevents the hydrated alkali cation to noncovalently
interact with some of the atoms at the surface. As a result, active
sites on the Pt(221) and Pt(331), especially type 2, will be affected
differently depending on the type of the metal cations. One can assume
the presence of an optimum metal cation hydration energy/shell size,
which correlates with the ORR activity of the electrocatalyst. For
instance, Li+ and Na+ might have too high hydration
energy and small hydration shell radii, whereas Rb+ and
Cs+ might have too low hydration energy and large hydration
shell radii, which results in lowering of the ORR activity. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the reason why the electrolytes containing
K+ result in a higher ORR activity compared to other metal
cations could be due to the hydration energy/shell size and/or due
to the divergent effect of each alkali metal on the OH*-binding energies
on the active sites of the high-index Pt surface.

In addition,
to demonstrate the possible negative activity role
of, namely, alkali metal cations, not only the pH effect the following
experiments were performed. It is mostly assumed that perchlorate
anions do not adsorb on the electrode surface and do not interact
with the reactants/intermediates. Taking this as a working hypothesis,
in a separate experiment we explored the effect of K+ concentration
on the activity of Pt(221) (Figure 6). The ORR kinetic current density of Pt(221) in 0.1
M KOH and in 0.1 M KOH + 0.1 M KClO4 electrolytes was measured
and shown in Figure 6A, and we also show the kinetic current densities at 0.9 V versus
RHE as a bar chart in Figure 6B. The activity of the electrocatalyst significantly decreased
with the increasing amount of K+ at the same pH further
explaining the difference in the activities between alkaline and acidic
media shown in Figure 3. However, additional influence of ClO4– anions cannot be excluded.

Figure 6 (A) Typical kinetic current density and (B)
bar chart showing the
kinetic current densities at 0.9 V vs RHE for Pt(221) electrodes in
0.1 M KOH and in 0.1 M KOH + 0.1 M KClO4 electrolytes.
The latter electrolyte was prepared by mixing HClO4 (where
the highest activity in acidic media is observed) and KOH (where the
highest activity in alkaline media is observed). The error bars are
from five different measurements.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the influence
of metal cations on the ORR activities
of the Pt(221) and Pt(331) surfaces was investigated in five different
AM–OH alkaline electrolytes (AM = Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+). We observed
that the influence of the nature of the alkali metal cations on the
ORR at Pt(221) and Pt(331) is different when compared to that of Pt(111).
For Pt(111), the activity increases when the solution is switched
from acidic to basic media. However, for Pt(221) and Pt(331), it is
noticeably decreased. The presence of several types of active sites
on high-index Pt single crystals interacting with the alkali metal
cations seems to have a key role in decreased ORR activity in alkaline
solutions. The ORR activity of the stepped Pt electrodes was strongly
dependent on the type of the metal cation in alkaline solution and
the trend was as follows: K+ ≫ Na+ >
Cs+ > Rb+ ≈ Li+. The Pt(221)
electrodes showed higher ORR activity than Pt(331) in all alkaline
solutions. In combination of the divergent effect of each alkali metal
cation on the OH-binding energies on the active sites of the high-index
Pt surface and the hydration energy/shell size of solvated metal cations,
our results confirmed that not only the pH but alkali metal cations
also play a decisive role in changes of the ORR activity of complex
Pt surfaces. Further research can be carried out on stepped Pt surfaces
with various terrace widths in order to endorse the proposed mechanism
of the alkali metal cation influence.

4 Experimental
Methods
Single crystals of bead type: Pt(331) (Icryst, Jülich,
Germany)
and Pt(221) (provided by Prof. Juan Feliu, Alicante, Spain) were used
in all of the experiments. For the preparation of the electrode surface
crystal structure, the single crystals were flame-annealed with an
isobutene gas flame and then cooled down in the mixture of CO (4.7,
Air Liquide, Germany) and Ar (5.0, Air Liquide, Germany). The electrode
surface structure quality was investigated by taking CVs in Ar-saturated
0.1 M HClO4 solution, which are proven to be extremely
sensitive to both miniscule electrolyte contaminations and surface
imperfections.44−46 Afterward, CVs of the Pt electrodes were recorded
in Ar-saturated 0.1 M solutions of alkali metal hydroxides (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+). Then, the electrode activities toward ORR were measured
under the HM-RDE configuration (see refs (47) and (48)) in O2-saturated (5.0, Air Liquide, Germany)
electrolytes. The electrodes were rotated at 1600 rpm for all measurements.
The similar experiments were performed in a solution containing 0.1
M KOH and 0.1 M KClO4.

All glassware and experimental
cells were cleaned with a 7:3 ratio
mixture of H2SO4 and H2O2 (both Suprapur and purchased from Merck, Germany). Afterward, they
were cleaned and rinsed several times with boiling ultrapure water
(Evoqua, Germany). A VSP-300 potentiostat (Bio-Logic, France) was
used for all of the electrochemical measurements. For an initial cycle
of each measurement, the working electrodes were introduced into the
solution under potential control at 0.05 V versus RHE.

A polycrystalline
platinum wire and a mercury–mercury sulfate
electrode (SI Analytics, Germany) were used as a counter and a reference
electrode, respectively. All of the reported potentials in this study
are referred to the RHE scale.

The solutions of perchloric acid
were prepared by diluting the
70% HClO4 (Suprapur, Merck, Germany) with ultrapure water
(Evoqua, Germany). The alkali metal hydroxide solutions were prepared
from LiOH·H2O (99.998%, TraceSELECT, Sigma-Aldrich),
NaOH (99.99%, semiconductor grade, Sigma-Aldrich), KOH (99.99%, trace
metal basis, Sigma-Aldrich), RbOH (99.9%, 50 wt % solution, Sigma-Aldrich),
and CsOH (99.9%, 50 wt % solution, Sigma-Aldrich). For the preparation
of the mixture solution of KClO4 + KOH, first, a 0.4 M
KOH solution and a 0.2 M HClO4 solution were prepared from
previously mentioned respective chemicals and subsequently mixed in
a 1:1 ratio.
