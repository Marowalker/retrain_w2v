Gluconobacter
oxydans plays an important role in the conversion
of d-sorbitol to l-sorbose, which is an essential
intermediate for the industrial-scale production of vitamin C. In
the fermentation process, some d-sorbitol could be converted
to d-fructose and other byproducts by uncertain dehydrogenases.
Genome sequencing has revealed the presence of diverse genes encoding
dehydrogenases in G. oxydans. However,
the characteristics of most of these dehydrogenases remain unclear.
Therefore, the analyses of these unknown dehydrogenases could be useful
for identifying those related to the production of d-fructose
and other byproducts. Accordingly, dehydrogenases in G. oxydans WSH-003, an industrial strain used for
vitamin C production, were examined. A nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD)-dependent dehydrogenase, which was annotated as xylitol dehydrogenase
2, was identified, codon-optimized, and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The enzyme exhibited
a high preference for NAD+ as the cofactor, while no activity
with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, flavin adenine dinucleotide,
or pyrroloquinoline quinone was noted. Although this enzyme presented
high similarity with NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase, it showed
high activity to catalyze d-sorbitol to d-fructose.
Unlike the optimum temperature and pH for most of the known NAD-dependent
xylitol dehydrogenases (30–40 °C and about 6–8,
respectively), those for the identified enzyme were 57 °C and
12, respectively. The values of Km and Vmax of the identified dehydrogenase toward l-sorbitol were 4.92 μM and 196.08 μM/min, respectively.
Thus, xylitol dehydrogenase 2 can be useful for the cofactor-reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide regeneration under alkaline conditions,
or its knockout can improve the conversion ratio of d-sorbitol
to l-sorbose.

Introduction
The genus Gluconobacter is a part of the group
of acetic acid bacteria that are characterized by their ability to
incompletely oxidize a wide range of carbohydrates and alcohols.1Gluconobacter strains have been
successfully used for the industrial production of food-related products,
pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, such as vitamin C,2 miglitol,3 dihydroxyacetone
(DHA),4 and ketogluconates.5 In particular, Gluconobacter oxydans has applications in the production of food additives and sweeteners
owing to its ability to synthesize flavoring ingredients from aromatic
alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, and 5-ketofructose.6 Besides, G. oxydans enzymes,
cell membranes, and whole cells are also used as sensor systems for
the detection of polyols, sugars, and alcohols.7 In recent years, some G. oxydans strains have been employed for the production of enantiomeric pharmaceuticals
and platform compounds; for example, G. oxydans DSM2343 has been employed for the reduction of various ketones used
in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products.8G. oxydans has been utilized
for l-erythrulose or l-erythrose production9 and9d-xylulose
and xylitol production.10G. oxydans DSM 2003 has been used for 3-hydroxypropionic
acid production.11 As all of these products
are related to the dehydrogenases of G. oxydans, identification of these enzymes in G. oxydans can expand the application of this bacterium.

Gluconobacter strains possess numerous dehydrogenases, some of which have been
identified, such as alcohol dehydrogenase, which could convert ethanol
to acetaldehyde,12 nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)-dependent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase,
which could convert acetaldehyde to acetate,13 pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent glucose dehydrogenase,
which could convert d-glucose to d-gluconate,12a gluconate dehydrogenase, which could convert d-gluconate to 2- or 5-ketogluconate,14 2-ketogluconate dehydrogenase, which could convert 2-ketogluconate
to 2,5-diketogluconate,12ad-sorbitol
dehydrogenase, which could convert d-sorbitol to l-sorbose or d-fructose,12a,15 sorbose/sorbosone
dehydrogenase, which could convert l-sorbose to l-sorbosone or 2-keto-l-gulonic acid (2-KLG),16 mannitol dehydrogenase, which could convert d-mannitol to d-fructose,17 quinate dehydrogenase, which could convert quinic acid to shikimic
acid,18 glycerol dehydrogenase, which could
convert glycerol to DHA,18c etc. In 2005,
the complete genome of G. oxydans 621H
was sequenced,19 which revealed 75 open
reading frames that encode putative dehydrogenases/oxidoreductases
of unknown functions. Identification of the functions of these unknown
dehydrogenases/oxidoreductases is important to expand the application
of G. oxydans. For instance, carbonyl
reductase (GoKR) from G. oxydans DSM2343
has been employed for the reduction of various ketones,8 and membrane-bound alcohol dehydrogenase (mADH)
and membrane-bound aldehyde dehydrogenase from G. oxydans DSM 2003 have been employed for 3-hydroxypropionic acid production.11

In G. oxydans, the central metabolic pathway, such as citrate cycle and Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas
pathway, is incomplete because of the absence of some genes encoding
succinate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, phosphotransacetylase,
acetate kinase, succinyl-CoA synthetase, succinate dehydrogenase,
isocitratelyase, and malate synthase,20 which may be the reason for the low biomass of G.
oxydans when cultured in rich medium. In a previous
study, sdhCDABE genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase
and flavinylation factor SdhE, ndh gene encoding
a type II reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase,
and sucCD from Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus encoding succinyl-CoA synthetase were expressed in G. oxydans to increase its biomass yield.20b However, G. oxydans biomass only increased by 60%, suggesting the presence of some unknown
bottleneck. Except for the tricarboxylic acid cycle, all the genes
were identified to encode enzymes involved in oxidative pentose phosphate
and Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathways.19 The pentose phosphate pathway is believed to be the most important
route for the phosphorylative breakdown of sugars and polyols to CO2 and provide carbon skeleton. It has been speculated that G. oxydans has the capability to uptake and channelize
several polyols, sugars, and sugar derivatives into the oxidative
pentose phosphate pathway; however, the gene involved in this process
is still unknown. Hence, in the fermentation of d-sorbitol
to l-sorbose for vitamin C production, some d-sorbitol
maybe get converted to d-fructose or other byproduct to enter
the pentose phosphate pathway for cell growth.19,21 Therefore,
it is crucial to balance and control the conversion of d-sorbitol
to l-fructose for cell growth and sorbose production.

Gene disruption and complementation experiments are often used to
verify one gene function. Some G. oxydans genes have been identify by using this method, such as PQQ-dependent d-sorbitol dehydrogenase responsible for the oxidation of 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)
amino-1-deoxy-d-sorbitol to 6-(2-hydroxyethyl) amino-6-deoxy-l-sorbose, which is the precursor of an antidiabetic drug miglitol,3 pyruvate decarboxylase that catalyzes the conversion
of pyruvate to acetaldehyde by decarboxylation,22 mADH, membrane-bound inositol dehydrogenase, membrane-bound
PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase, etc.23 However, some G. oxydans genes encoding
dehydrogenases are necessary for cell growth, and their knockout resulted
in the absence of growth (unpublished data). Besides, G. oxydans comprises numerous dehydrogenases, some
of which are isoenzymes, such as SldAB1 and SldAB2 of G. oxydans WSH-003,24 or
are often associated with a broad range of substrates such as GoKR.8 Hence, the use of gene knockout strategy to identify
the functions of some dehydrogenases of G. oxydans, especially the numerous unknown dehydrogenases of G. oxydans WSH-003, may not be appropriate. Therefore,
in the present study, we expressed numerous unknown dehydrogenases
of G. oxydans WSH-003 in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified the
products by one-step affinity chromatography with the Ni-NTA agarose
column to identify their functions. The results revealed a new xylitol
dehydrogenase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent xylitol
dehydrogenase 2) that could convert d-sorbitol to d-fructose. Kinetic analysis of the novel enzyme revealed some unique
traits that were quite different from the known xylitol dehydrogenases.
The optimum temperature and pH of the identified xylitol dehydrogenase
2 were 57 °C and 12, respectively. This novel enzyme provides
new insights into G. oxydans dehydrogenases
and could have potential applications in xylitol production.

Results
Gene Expression
and Purification of the Identified Dehydrogenase
The selected
dehydrogenase from G. oxydans WSH-003
was successfully expressed and purified. Sequence analysis revealed
that the purified enzyme, annotated as xylitol dehydrogenase 2, contained
a NAD(P)-binding motif and a classical active site motif belonging
to the short-chain dehydrogenase family. Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis analysis showed an expected single band with a
molecular weight of about 38 kDa (Figure 1A), which was consistent with the calculated
molecular mass based on the deduced amino acid sequence (36.6 kDa).
The optimum pH and the temperature of the purified xylitol dehydrogenase
2 were determined to be pH 12 (50 mM glycine–NaOH buffer) and
57 °C, respectively (Figure 1B,C), which are different from those for known xylitol
dehydrogenases.

Identification of
Cofactor of Xylitol Dehydrogenase 2
In general, dehydrogenases
require some cofactors as electron acceptors, such as NAD(P), flavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD)/flavin mononucleotide, or PQQ. Most of
the previously identified membrane dehydrogenases from G. oxydans have been reported to utilize PQQ or FAD
as the cofactor. According to the prediction of transmembrane domains,
xylitol dehydrogenase 2 from G. oxydans WSH-003 was noted to lack transmembrane domain. Therefore, the cofactor
of the identified dehydrogenase was verified by using purified enzyme
to catalyze reactions with different cofactors. The results showed
that xylitol dehydrogenase 2 was highly specific for NAD+ and no detectable enzyme activity was observed with NADP+, FAD, or PQQ as the cofactor (Figure 2).

cofactor of xylitol dehydrogenase 2. Catalytic reaction of purified
xylitol dehydrogenase 2 (A) without a cofactor, (B) with NAD+, (C) with NADP+, (D) with FAD, and (E) with PQQ.

Effect of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic
Acid (EDTA) and Metal Ions on Enzyme Activity
To determine
the effects of chelator and metal ions on NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase
2, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and various ions (0.5 mM
Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Cr3+, and Fe3+) were added to the reaction
system. EDTA elicited no obvious effect on NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase
2, indicating that the enzyme does not require a chelator for its
activity. However, the enzyme could be activated by Zn2+, Co2+, and Mn2+, among which Zn2+ improved the enzyme activity by 1.8 times. In contrast, Cu2+ could almost completely inhibit the activity of NAD-dependent xylitol
dehydrogenase 2 (Figure 3), while the rest of the examined metal ions had no obvious impact
on the enzyme activity.

Substrate
Specificity and Kinetic Constants
In recent years, xylitol
dehydrogenase has been used for the industrial production of xylitol,
and under enhanced NADH supply, NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase
can reduce d-xylulose to the desired xylitol. In the present
study, substrate specificity analysis of the NAD-dependent xylitol
dehydrogenase 2 revealed that the enzyme was highly specific toward d-sorbitol and xylitol, but showed limited activity toward d-mannitol, sorbose, and glycerol. Moreover, the enzyme showed
no activity when glucose, inositol, galactose, mannose, rhamnose,
xylose, fructose, glucuronic acid, glucolactone, 2-KLG, gluconic,
propanol, isopropanol, methanol, and ethanol were used as substrates
(Figure 4). To determine
the kinetic constants, the initial velocities of the enzyme were determined
in glycine–NaOH buffer (pH 12) with d-sorbitol (at
increasing concentrations from 1 to 500 mM) under standard assay conditions,
and Km and Vmax were noted to be 4.92 μM and 196.08 μM/min, respectively.

Discussion
In this study,
a xylitol dehydrogenase from 44 uncharacterized dehydrogenases of G. oxydans WSH-003 was identified and characterized.
This novel NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase 2 could convert d-sorbitol to d-fructose, indicating certain correlation
of this enzyme with pentose phosphate pathway.20b The optimum temperature and pH for the identified xylitol
dehydrogenase 2 revealed its unique characteristics, when compared
with some of the previously identified xylitol dehydrogenases. It
has been reported that d-fructose is the major byproduct
formed during the conversion of d-sorbitol to l-sorbose
by G. oxydans in industrial-scale vitamin
C production,21 and that knockout of genes
involved in d-fructose production can further improve the
conversion rate of d-sorbitol to l-sorbose. Owing
to its unique characteristics, the NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase
2 identified in the present study can be applied for the production
of d-xylitol.10a To characterize
all the dehydrogenases of G. oxydans WSH-003, the enzymes were predicted and heterologously overexpressed
in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Then,
the expressed dehydrogenases were purified by one-step affinity chromatography
with Ni-NTA agarose column. While most of the dehydrogenases with
obvious expression levels in E. coli showed no activities, NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase 2 could
efficiently convert d-sorbitol to d-fructose.

Previous studies have indicated that majority of the numerous dehydrogenases
in G. oxydans are membrane-bound, PQQ-
or FAD-dependent enzymes with more than one subunit; for example,
alcohol dehydrogenases have three subunits,25 aldehyde dehydrogenases have two subunits,26d-sorbitol dehydrogenases have one or three subunits,15a,15d,27 and polyol dehydrogenase have
two subunits.28 Most of the cytoplasmic-soluble
polyol dehydrogenases are NADP-dependent with more than one subunit;
for instance, NADP-dependent d-sorbitol dehydrogenase have
four subunits, NADP-dependent d-sorbitol dehydrogenase have
two subunits,29 and NAD-dependent ribitol
dehydrogenase have four subunits.30 However,
the xylitol dehydrogenase 2 identified in the present study was noted
to be NAD-dependent with only one subunit. The amino acid sequence
of the NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase 2 showed similarity to
those of the enzymes in the MDR superfamily. However, the optimum
pH and temperature for the oxidation activity of the NAD-dependent
xylitol dehydrogenase 2 were observed to be slightly higher than those
reported in earlier studies for the same reaction of xylitol dehydrogenases
isolated from different strains of G. oxydans.(31) The reason for this variation in the
optimum pH and temperature for xylitol dehydrogenase activity could
be due to different source strains from which the enzymes were isolated.

With regard to the substrate specificity of xylitol dehydrogenases,
xylitol dehydrogenase from G. oxydans ATCC 621 has been noted to present a higher catalytic activity toward
sorbitol and xylitol,32 whereas xylitol
dehydrogenase from Gluconobacter thailandicus CGMCC1.3748 has been demonstrated to exhibit catalytic activity
toward xylitol, d-sorbitol, d-mannitol, and d-fructose.31 Besides, while most
of the known xylitol dehydrogenases have been reported to be dependent
on cofactor NAD+, an NADP+-dependent xylitol
dehydrogenase has been found to increase ethanol production from xylose
in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae though protein engineering.33

In
most of the identified G. oxydans strains,
glycolysis, and citric acid cycle are incomplete owing to the lack
of phosphofructokinase and succinate dehydrogenase,19 which is the main reason for the low biomass yield of G. oxydans, when compared with other common bacteria,
and a major limitation to the use of G. oxydans whole-cell biotransformation. It has been reported that pentose
phosphate pathway and ED pathway are the main catabolic routes for
biomass and energy supply in Gluconobacter strains.34 Despite its industrial application for several
decades, the metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms of Gluconobacter spp. are not yet fully elucidated.35 To improve the biomass of G.
oxydans, Krajewski et al. knocked out the membrane-bound
glucose dehydrogenase and soluble glucose dehydrogenase and improved
the biomass by 271%.36 An understanding
of the mechanisms of catabolism of polyols, sugars, and sugar derivatives
into the pentose phosphate pathway is essential for increasing the
biomass and catalysis efficiency of G. oxydans strains. As d-sorbitol and l-sorbose cannot directly
enter into the pentose phosphate pathway, they must be catabolized
via some intermediates. The NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase 2
identified in the present study can catalyze d-sorbitol to d-fructose, which can directly enter the pentose phosphate pathway
through phosphorylation, suggesting that the overexpression of this
enzyme may increase the biomass of G. oxydans by utilizing more d-sorbitol.

In conclusion, a novel
NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase 2 from G. oxydans WSH-003 was identified in this study. Owing to its unique characteristics,
such as optimum pH and temperature, the identified dehydrogenase could
be used in the production of xylitol or fructose, or in regeneration
of cofactor under specific conditions. Although G.
oxydans WSH-003 has been mutated from wild-type strain
at least 90 times by different methods with reliable records to improve
the l-sorbose production and tolerance to saccharides and
alditols such as l-sorbose and d-sorbitol, generation
of d-fructose as the byproduct of the strain could not be
resolved. However, knockout of this xylitol dehydrogenase and similar
dehydrogenases could facilitate further increase in the yield of d-sorbitol to l-sorbose, which could be important for
the current industrial-scale production of vitamin C.

Materials and Methods
Genes, Plasmids, and Strains
The vector pMD19-T Simple and
pET-28a(+) were used for vector construction and protein expression,
respectively. E. coli JM109 cells were
employed for plasmid construction, and E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were used for protein expression. The dehydrogenase
gene (GenBank accession no. 29878874) was PCR-amplified from the genomic
DNA of G. oxydans WSH-003 using the
primer pair CCGGAATTCATGGCTCAAGCTTTGGTTCTGGAAC/CCGCTCGAGTCAGCCTGGAAGCTTAATTTGTAGCTTC,
purified, digested, and inserted into EcoRI/XhoI sites of pET-28a(+) to obtain pET-28a-XDH. The recombinant
plasmid pET-28a-XDH was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells for protein expression. All the sequences were
verified by Sanger sequencing (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). The
transmembrane domains of the protein were predicted by using TMHMM
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/).

Gene Expression and Purification of Dehydrogenase
The recombinant strain was cultured in 250 mL shake flasks containing
25 mL of terrific broth medium. After growth to log phase (OD600 = 0.6), the cells were precooled to 20 °C. Then, 0.5
mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to
induce protein expression, and the cells were incubated at 20 °C
for another 16 h for protein expression.

Subsequently, the cells
were collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min, washed twice
with binding buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer), and lysed by sonication
at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 7000 rpm at
4 °C to obtain a clear supernatant. The supernatant was passed
through a 0.45 μm filter and then applied to a 5 mL nickel-charged
Hi-Trap column pre-equilibrated with binding buffer. The column was
washed with 15 mL of binding buffer and then with washing buffer (50
mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM imidazole; pH adjusted
to 7.0) until no more protein was eluted. The column was eluted with
20 mL of eluting buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, and
500 mM imidazole), and the pH of the eluent was adjusted to 7.0. The
fractions were combined and dialyzed against dialysis buffer (50 mM
phosphate buffer).

Enzyme Assay and
Identification of Cofactor
The enzyme activity was measured
by determining the increase in absorbance of NADH at 340 nm. The reaction
mixture contained 2 mM NAD+, 20 mM sorbitol, 50 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 12), and enzyme solution to a total volume of 200 μL.
One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing
the formation of 1 μmol of reduced NAD+ per minute
at 30 °C under the given conditions.

Effect of Metal Ions and EDTA
In order to determine
the effect of the metal ions and the EDTA on the enzyme, various metal
ions (0.5 mM) and EDTA (5 mM) were added individually to the reaction
mixture. Relative activity was used to investigate, while the reaction
mixture without any additional treatment served as a control (100%).

Substrate Specificity and Determination
of Kinetic Constants
Substrate specificity of the identified
dehydrogenase was tested using 20 mM xylitol, glucose, d-mannitol,
inositol, sorbose, galactose, sorbitol, mannose, rhamnose, xylose,
fructose, glucuronic acid, glucolactone, 2-KLG, gluconic acid, propanol,
glycerol, inopropanol, methanol, and ethanol in the above-mentioned
buffers. For kinetics experiments, the substrate concentrations were
varied between 1 and 500 mM and the cofactor concentration was 2 mM.

Determination of Optimum Temperature
and pH for the Identified Dehydrogenase
To determine the
optimum pH, the enzyme activity was assessed in a pH range of 3–13
in the following buffers (50 mM): NaAc–HAc (pH 3.0–5.0),
phosphate-buffered saline (pH 5.0–9.0), Tris–HCl (pH
9.0–10.0), and glycine–NaOH (pH 9.0–13). Similarly,
the optimal temperature for the identified dehydrogenase was determined
by analyzing the enzyme activity to be from 20 to 70 °C.
