The interface structure
between NaCl crystal and its solution has
been investigated at the saturated concentration of 298 K by molecular
dynamics simulations. We have found that there are many fine structures
at this complex interface. Near the surface of crystal, most of Na+ only coordinate with water molecules, while almost all Cl– coordinate with Na+ in addition to water
molecules. An ion coordinating with more water molecules is farther
away from the epitaxial position of lattice. As approaching to the
interface, the first hydration shell of ions has the tendency of being
ordered, while the orientation of dipole of water molecules in the
first hydration shell becomes more disordered than that in the solution.
Generally, the first hydration shell of Na+ is less affected
by nearest Cl–, whereas the first hydration shell
of Cl– is significantly affected by nearest Na+.

Introduction
In nature and daily life, the solid–liquid
interface (SLI)
between ionic crystals and solutions is ubiquitous. Many important
physical phenomena and processes occur around SLIs, which are the
key to understand the properties of two-phase boundary,1−4 flotation,5−8 crystal dissolution,9−12 growth,9,12−15 etc. For a long time, scientists
have made great efforts to investigate the intrinsic feature of SLIs
by various experimental techniques and computer simulations.

Due to the strong influence of the periodic character of crystal
and long-range Coulomb interaction, the SLI between the ionic crystal
and solution is usually more complicated than that of simple metal
solid–liquid interfaces.1,3,4,7,16,17 Compared to experimental methods, computer
simulation is a powerful tool to obtain atomic scale information.
The previous simulations have made important progresses for understanding
the atomic scale structure of interfaces. It was found that both ions
and water molecules exhibit a layerlike structure in the direction
perpendicular to the interface.15,17−31 Besides, the water molecules19−21,24−26,28,30,32 and ions14,19,20,24,25,28,30,32,33 at the interface are laterally ordered with respect to the crystal
structure. The dipole moment of water molecules at the SLI also tends
to be ordered.17−19,21,24−26,34 Interestingly, ions
at an SLI have much complexed adsorption structures,18,20−24,27−29,31−33,35−37 which depends on the ions’ radius,19,23,25,27,29,31−33 valence,29,31 as well as the crystal surface
structure.21,27,29,30,38

Hydration
structures are the core structural unit for understanding
the structure and physical properties of solutions. On the one hand,
it is believed that the hydration shell still exists near the interface
between crystal and solutions.11,12,38−41 On the other hand, as approaching to interfaces, water molecules
may rearrange with certain order.7,17,34,42 It is not difficult
to imagine that the hydration structure at SLI will be more complex
under the two competing factors, namely, the tendency of maintaining
hydration shell and the ordering tendency of water molecules. In addition
to the impact on the structure, the ionic hydration shell is also
the key to understand the transport of ions.9,11,12,43 However, the
ionic hydration structure itself has not been investigated systematically.

Interface between the NaCl and its solution is a typical example
of this kind of SLI, which serves as a common system for studying
complex interfaces.4,7,11−14,17,34,42,44,45 In this work, the interfacial structure between NaCl
crystal and saturated NaCl solution has been studied by molecular
dynamics method. Our study has focused on the hydration structure
of ions, especially on how the crystal surface affects both ions distribution
and hydration structure and how the distribution of ions and ionic
hydration structure interplay with each other. We find that there
are many fine structures at the interface. The distribution of water
molecules in the ionic hydration structure around the interface is
strongly modified by the local environment of ions.

Results and Discussion
The density distribution of ions and oxygens along the z direction is shown in Figure 1. Large density oscillations and layerlike
structure are observed near the interface, which is universal in SLI
systems. According to the density distribution of Na+ and
Cl–, at least three layers can be identified. For
the convenience of the following discussion, we assume that the first
layer refers to the one closest to the crystal surface and next is
the second and third layer in turn. In the first layer, the number
of Na+ is obviously more than that of Cl–, which is consistent with previous work.17 As demonstrated by Yang et. al.,13 Na+ is easier to be adsorbed on crystal surface by replacing
water molecules than Cl–.

Figure 1 Density distribution
of H (green dot-dash line), O (red dash line),
Na+ (blue dot line), and Cl– (magenta
solid line) along the direction perpendicular to the interface, where
the vertical dash line marks the epitaxial lattice position.

In the first layer, the density distribution of
Na+ and
Cl– with different nw’s is presented in Figure 2a,b, respectively. One can see that, in the first layer,
Na+ prefers to coordinate with water molecules, while Cl– prefers to coordinate with Na+. Our calculations
show that, around 39.7% of Na+ coordinate with Cl– and water molecules at the same time, while the rest Na+ do not coordinate with Cl– but only with water
molecules (nc = 0). However, around 92.2%
of Cl– coordinate with Na+ and water
molecules at the same time and 7.8% of Cl– coordinate
only with water molecules (nc = 0). Evidently,
Na+ has stronger tendency to keep the hydration structure,
which is consistent with previous results.46

Figure 2 Distribution
of density of Na+ (a) and Cl (b) near the
interface with various nw and nc, where the vertical dash line marks the epitaxial
lattice position. nw denotes the number
of water molecules in the first hydration shell, and nc is the number of the nearest counter ions.

The first peak of the density distribution for both Na+ and Cl– does not locate at the epitaxial
lattice
position (marked as the vertical dash line in Figures 1 and 2). We find that
the shift of the first peak is closely related to the local environment
of ions, i.e., the coordination number of water molecules or counter
ions around an ion. From Figure 2a,b, one can see that for both Na+ and Cl–, the less water molecules in the first hydration shell
(FHS) are, the closer to the epitaxial lattice position is. If a Cl– is coordinated with more water molecules, it will
be further away from the crystal surface. By contrast, a Na+ will be closer to the crystal surface if it is coordinated with
more water molecules. The results can be roughly understood as follows:
the distribution of ions in the first layer is mainly determined by
two factors: (1) maintaining the ionic hydration shell and (2) driving
ions to the ideal lattice position. Because of the mismatch between
hydrate shell of ions and lattice structure, the former makes ions
deviate from the ideal lattice, while the latter drives ions back
to the ideal lattice. Therefore, with the decrease of nw, the ions will approach to the ideal lattice position
gradually. In principle, the structure of interface is the result
of competition between the energy and entropy. Our results show that
the energy seems to be superior to entropy at the interface, indicated
by the increased ordering tendency of both ions and water molecules.

From Figure 2, one
can find another interesting feature, namely, the first layer is composed
of a few sublayers. Each sublayer can be distinguished by the different nc or nw. We find
that the sum of nc and nw is approximately a constant, which can be seen from Table 1. For Na+ and Cl–, the sum is around 5 and 6, respectively.
In other words, if an ion coordinates with more counter ions, it will
coordinate with less water molecules. If the density profile of the
first layer is approximated by the Gaussian distribution, we find
that the major difference among sublayers is the position of peak,
not the half-width.

Table 1 Number of Water Molecules
in the First
Hydration Shell (nw) for Ions with Different
Coordination Number of Counter Ions (nc)
 	nc = 0	nc = 1	nc = 2	nc = 3	
Na+	5.0 ± 0.05	4.0 ± 0.07	3.0 ± 0.13	1.9 ± 0.23	
Cl–	6.0 ± 0.48	5.2 ± 0.32	4.3 ± 0.29	3.3 ± 0.69	
The ion-oxygen radial distribution functions (RDFs) in the first
three layers are shown in Figure 3a,b. For comparison, the ion-oxygen RDF in the solution
is also shown. The position of the first peak in RDFs corresponds
to the average radius of the FHS, and the area included by the first
peak is proportional to nw. For both cation
and anion, the interface has little effect on the average radius of
the FHS, which can be seen in the inset of Figure 3a,b. For Na+ and Cl– in the first layer, as shown by the green line in Figure 3a,b, the first peak of ion-oxygen
RDF is obviously lower than others, which indicates that the interface
has an unneglectable effect on nw. However,
this effect only works in the first layer, and for the second and
third layers, the first peak of ion-oxygen RDF is approximately equal
to that in solutions.

Figure 3 Ion-O RDFs. (a) Na+-O RDF in the first three
layers
and solution. (b) Same as (a) but for Cl–. (c) Na+-O RDF for two kinds of Na+ in the first layer,
namely, coordinating with (labeled as type I) and without (labeled
as type II) counter ions. Here, “total” denotes the
sum of type I and type II. (d) Same as (c) but for Cl– in the first layer. The insets show the focus view of the first
peak of ion-O RDF.

As mentioned above, ions
with different nc values may have different
local structures. To further clarify
this difference, we divide both Na+ and Cl– in the first layer into two classes, namely, coordinating with (hereafter
labeled as type I, namely, nc > 0)
and
without (hereafter labeled as type II, namely, nc = 0) counter ions. As shown in Figure 3c, the Na+-O RDFs for both type
I and type II are similar, and the main difference appears in the
first peaks. However, as shown in Figure 3d, there are some remarkable difference in
the Cl–-O RDF between type I and type II. First,
the first peak of Cl–-O RDF of type II is much higher
than that of type I, due to more water molecules around type II Cl–. Second, near the first minimum of the Cl–-O RDF of type II, a small peak appears in the Cl–-O RDF of type I. These results may be the explanation why the radius
of FHS of Cl– is different before and after dissolution.47 Third, around the second peak of the Cl–-O RDF of type II, a minimum and a small peak appear
in the RDF of type I.

The angle distribution of water molecules
is the most intuitive
physical quantity to describe the orientation of water molecules in
the FHS. The distribution of cos(α) and cos(γ) near the
interface is depicted in Figure 4. As expected, the water molecules uniformly distribute
around ions in the solution and have no preferential orientation.
However, as approaching to the interface, obviously the preferential
orientation of water molecules in FHS appears. In other words, the
FHS of ions tends to be ordered as approaching to the interface. When
a Na+ approaches to the crystal surface, there are obviously
two preferred directions, around cos(γ) = 0 and 1, and α
prefers to stay around cos(α)= 0 and ±1. For Cl–, the distribution of cos(γ) is similar to that for Na+. On the contrary, the distribution of cos(α) for Cl– seems to have five preferred values of 0.0, ±0.71,
and ±1.0, as approaching to the crystal surface.

Figure 4 Angle distribution for
water molecules in FHS. (a, c) Distribution
of cos(γ) and cos(α) of Na+. (b, d) Same as
(a) and (c), respectively, but for Cl–.

The discussion above implies that the water molecules have
certain
ordering in the FHS. This kind of order is also closely related to
the local coordination environment of ions. Figure 5 presents the distribution of cos(α)
and cos(γ) in the FHS for Na+ (a and b) and Cl– (c and d) in the first layer. The distribution of
cos(α) and cos(γ) is similar for type I and type II Na+. The peak of type II Na+ at cos(α)=0 is
sharper than that of type I, and the distribution of cos(γ)
for type II just slightly shifts to the right relative to that of
type I. However, coordinating with/without Na+ has a significant
effect on the orientation of water molecules in the FHS of Cl–. The distribution of both cos(α) and cos(γ)
for type I Cl– has more and sharper peaks than those
for type II Cl–, which indicates that the water
around type I Cl– is more ordered.

Figure 5 Distribution of cos(α)
(a) and cos(γ) (b) in FHS of
two types of Na+ in the first layer. (c, d) Same as (a)
and (b), respectively, but for Cl–.

Dipole orientation of water molecules is another important
physical
quantity to describe the ordering of water molecules in the FHS. The
dipole orientation of water molecules is characterized by φ
angles (see Figure 8), and the distribution of cos(φ) in the first layer is shown
in Figure 6. The dipole
of water molecules around both Na+ and Cl– in the solution prefers to point to a special direction, which is
consistent with the previous results.48,49 This special
orientation, which minimizes the Coulomb interaction between the central
ion and nearest water molecules, can be maintained in the interface
beyond the first layer. However, in the first layer, due to the strong
effect of crystal surface, the distribution of the dipole is no longer
confined to a sharp region and is broadened. Namely, the dipole orientation
of water molecules in the FHS is more disordered than that in the
solution. For both type I and type II Na+, the distribution
of cos(φ) in the first layer is similar, but different from
that in solutions: a new peak appears near cos(φ) = 0.78, as
shown in Figure 6a.
For type II Cl–, the distribution of cos(φ)
is similar to that in solution except a slight shift for the peak,
as shown in Figure 6b. However, for type I Cl–, the distribution of
cos(φ) is broadened remarkably relative to that of type II Cl–, and even some φ angles locate at the region
where the interaction between Cl– and dipole becomes
unstable locally.

Figure 6 Distributions of cos(φ) in the FHS of the first
layer (black
dot and red dash line) and of solutions (green solid line) for Na+ (a) and Cl– (b).

The change in the four angles is hard to explain within a simple
physical picture or model, but surely it is closely related to the
crystal surface because the most significant changes occur in the
crystal surface. Two factors may play the major role: (1) The structure
of the crystal surface. It promotes the ordered arrangement of ions,
thus destroying the hydration structure and leads to the redistribution
of water molecules. (2) The Coulomb field formed by anions and cations
in the crystal makes the water molecules at the surface to rearrange
with a specific orientation. These two factors, together with the
hydration structure of ions, lead to the ordering distribution of
water molecules in the FHS and slight disordering in dipole orientations.

As final remark, it should be point that, in the solution, the
water molecules appear uniformly around the ions in the means of time
average; however, the ordered arrangement of water molecules around
an ion at the interface is more likely pinned. This is because the
diffusion of ions and water molecules at the interface is much slower
than that in the solution.

Summary
The solid–liquid
interface between a NaCl crystal and its
solution along the (100) direction of crystal has been studied systematically
by using the molecular dynamics method. By calculating the various
distributions of structural parameters, especially by distinguishing
coordination environments of ions, we obtain the following main conclusions:
(1) In the first layer nearest to the crystal surface, both cation
and anion deviate from the epitaxial position of lattice. The magnitude
of deviations strongly depends on the local coordination environments
of ions. (2) The coordination between anions and cations has a little
effect on the FHS of Na+ but has a significant impact on
all aspects of the FHS of Cl–. (3) As approaching
to the interface, the hydration structure of ions tends to be ordered;
however, it is unconventional that the dipole orientation of water
molecules in the FHS has the tendency of disordering. The current
results may be helpful to further understand the thermodynamic and
dynamic behavior of ions at interfaces.

Computational Details
In this work, the interfacial structure between NaCl crystal and
its solution has been studied, in which the interface is parallel
to the (001) surface of NaCl crystal. The SPC/E model50 and the Joung–Cheatham (JC) model51 were used for water molecules and ions, respectively. The
JC model has been improved to reproduce the experimental hydration
free energies of ions and the lattice constants.51,52 The cross terms of the interaction potentials were calculated by
the Lorentz–Berthelot combination rules. The detailed potential
parameters are listed in Table 2.

All simulation in this
work was performed by the LAMMPS (Large-scale
Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) software package,53 which is a widely used molecular dynamics (MD)
code. The MD time step was taken as 1 fs, and the temperature in all
simulations was set as 298 K.

To set up the simulation system,
the following steps were performed:
(1) based on the saturated concentration (see below), a certain number
of water molecule and the corresponding number of anions and cations
were chosen. The ions were randomly distributed into water to form
a solution. (2) At 298 K and 1 bar, the solution was equilibrated
through long-time molecular dynamics simulation. (3) The solution
and a NaCl crystal are combined to build the interface system. Then,
an extensive simulation with the NPT ensemble was performed for 5
ns to equilibrate the system, in which the pressure was set as 1 bar
with the damping coefficient being 1000 time steps. Finally, a further
25 ns simulation at 298 K with NVT ensemble was used to calculate
the physical properties.

A snapshot of simulation system is
shown in Figure 7,
where three coordinate axes, x, y, and z, are
defined along the [100], [010], and [001]
directions of NaCl crystals, respectively. The solid–liquid
interface is parallel to the x–y plane, i.e., perpendicular to the z direction. In the current work, the origin
of z axis is defined as the position
of the outermost crystal layer. The system (57.8 Å × 57.8
Å × 151.2 Å) is composed of NaCl crystal (4000 Na+ and 4000 Cl–) and NaCl solution (1034 Na+, 1034 Cl–, and 9272 water molecules). The
concentration of the solution is 6.2 mol/kg, which is the saturation
concentration given by the JC model at room temperature (298 K)17 and close to the experimental value (6.16 mol/kg
at 298.15 K).17 The saturation concentration
has been thoroughly tested by others54 and
us. In fact, in our simulation of up to tens of nanoseconds, the system
does equilibrate at this concentration of room temperature.

Figure 7 Snapshot of
the interface system. The blue, magenta, green, and
red spheres represent Na+, Cl–, H, and
O, respectively. The x, y, and z axes are defined
along the [100], [010], and [001] directions of NaCl crystals, respectively.
The solid–liquid interface is parallel to the x–y plane, and perpendicular to the z direction.

To calculate the number density distribution along the direction
perpendicular to the interface ρ(zi), the system was equally divided into small bins with the width
of 0.2 Å along the z direction.
ρ(zi) reads  where the angle brackets
indicate the ensemble
average, and Ni, zi, and ΔV denote the number of atoms in the ith bin, the
central position of this bin, and the volume of a bin, respectively.
We have tested a few different widths of bin (from 0.2 to 0.6 Å)
and have not observed any evident effect on final results.

Regarding
the ionic hydration structure, the water in the first
hydration shell (FHS) has the most important influence on the structure
and properties of the system;48,49 thus, our studies will
only focus on FHS. The schematic illustration of FHS of an ion is
shown in Figure 8. The cutoff radius (Rc) for FHS is defined as first minimum of radial distribution
functions (RDFs) between ions and oxygens. We have found that Rc for Na+ and Cl– is 3.25 and 3.75 Å, respectively. To further characterize the
local environment of an ion, two coordination numbers (nc and nw) are defined, where nw denotes the number of water molecules in FHS,
the so-called hydration number, and nc is the number of the nearest counter ions. When calculating nc, the ions in the crystal are not taken into
account.

Figure 8 Schematic plot of FHS of an ion, in which the purple, red, and
blue spheres represent the central ions, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms,
respectively; n1 is a unit
vector from the central ion to an oxygen atom; n2 is another unit vector along the water molecule
dipole; the x, y, and z axes are defined in Figure 7. Rc is the cutoff radius of FHS.

As approaching to the interface, the spatial translational and
rotational symmetries of ions in the solution may be broken partially.
To characterize these effects, four angles (α, β, γ,
and φ), which have been marked in Figure 8, are defined based on two unit vectors (n1 and n2). n1 is the
unit vector from the central ion to oxygen atoms, and n2 is the unit vector along the dipole
of a water molecule. α, β, and γ were defined as
the angle between n1 and
three axes (x, y, and z), respectively. φ
is the angle between n1 and n2. The distribution of α,
β, γ, and φ was calculated as follows  where zi and Ni are the
positions of the ith bin and the number of ions in
this bin, respectively. nθ(cos(θ))
denotes the number of water molecules, whose cos(α) (or cos β),
cos(γ), and cos(φ) equal cos(θ). It needs to be
pointed out that, due to the symmetry of the current system, the distribution
of cos(β) is the same as that of cos(α).
