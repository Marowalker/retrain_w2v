Hydrate formation is a common challenge
in the oil and gas industry
when natural gas is transported under cold conditions in the presence
of water. Coatings are one of the solutions that have shown to be
a promising approach to address this challenge. However, this strategy
suffers from the intrinsic existence of a solid–liquid interface
causing a high rate of hydrate nucleation and high hydrate adhesion
strength. This proof-of-concept study highlights the performance of
a magnetic slippery surface to prevent hydrate adhesion at atmospheric
pressure using tetrahydrofuran hydrates. The coating consisted of
a hydrocarbon-based magnetic fluid, which was applied to a metal surface
to create an interface that lowered the hydrate adhesion strength
on the surface. The performance of these new surfaces under static
and dynamic (under fluid flow) conditions shows that the magnetic
coating gel can be a potential inhibitor for hydrate adhesion as it
reduced the torque value after the formation of hydrates.

1 Introduction
Gas hydrates are icelike
solids that form when water is combined
with a gas molecule such as ethane, methane, propane, or carbon dioxide
at low temperatures and elevated pressure.1−4 There are various deposits of
hydrates below the permafrost and on the seafloor. Extensive research
is being conducted to extract the gas that is trapped in the hydrates.
The estimated reserve of hydrates is enormous, making hydrates a potential
source of unconventional gas reserves.5 Although clathrate hydrates are a promising source of natural gas,
the nucleation of hydrates in pipelines and adherence to the walls
of subsea natural gas pipelines are major concerns.6,7 This
causes blockages of pipelines and production tubing, making necessary
the removal of the plug, which is a costly and complex process.8−10 In some extreme cases, the hydrate plugs may damage the gas transport
facilities, which poses a safety hazard.

To prevent hydrate
formation in subsea pipelines, chemical inhibitors
are used, which fall into two categories, thermodynamic inhibitors
and low-dosage hydrate inhibitors (LDHIs).11 Examples of thermodynamic inhibitors include methanol as well as
monoethylene glycol (MEG).12 LDHIs are
subdivided into kinetic inhibitors (KHIs) and antiagglomerants (AAs).13

When methanol or ethylene glycol is used
at sufficiently high concentrations,
hydrate formation can be prevented.12 However,
the required concentration of the thermodynamic inhibitors can be
as high as 50% based on the water phase. Thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors
are classified as inhibitors that prevent hydrate formation by elevating
the pressure and lowering the temperature of formation for hydrates,
which decreases the likelihood of hydrate formation.14 The advantage of using thermodynamic inhibitors is the
reliability of the approach and the relatively low cost of the chemicals;
however, this is offset by the volumes required and the need for recycling
facilities to regenerate the MEG.14−16

Overall, the cost
of methanol is lower than MEG per gallon; however,
the amount used to inhibit hydrate mitigation is significantly high,
making methanol injection costly, too.17−19 As stated above, the
concentration of thermodynamic inhibitors is also extremely high (60%
of the mass of water being produced).19 Furthermore, there are environmental and safety concerns surrounding
thermodynamic inhibitors. For MEG, the cost is higher than that of
methanol and the viscosity can cause issues with pumping the inhibitor,
which can increase capital costs.20

Insulating and heating pipelines is another approach, but this
requires high operating costs and often thermodynamic inhibitors are
required to inhibit hydrate formation but in a lower volume.1,2

Alternatively, LDHIs can be used including KHIs, which delay
the
hydrate formation, or AAs, which prevent the hydrate adhesion. KHIs
can be used as a substitute or in conjunction with thermodynamic hydrate
inhibitors like methanol or monoethylene glycol (MEG).21,22 Typically, KHIs are water-soluble polymers that delay nucleation.
There are various proposed mechanisms for KHIs with the water-soluble
polymer forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules, therefore inhibiting
hydrate formation.23,24 Examples of conventional water-soluble
polymeric kinetic inhibitors are poly(vinyl caprolactam) and poly(vinyl
pyrrolidone).23 The advantage of using
KHIs is the lower volume required when compared to thermodynamic inhibitors
(methanol or MEG). This significantly reduces the cost of regeneration
as well as the purchase cost of hydrate inhibitors.25 However, the performance of KHIs can be limited because
of the low inhibition properties of the KHIs during shut-ins, which
is a major disadvantage. This necessitates the use of secondary hydrate
control methods.11 Alternative LDHIs exist
called antiagglomerants (AAs), which do not prevent hydrate formation
but prevent hydrate adhesion, thereby preventing plugging.13,26 Therefore, AAs permit the formation of hydrates but keep the particles
well dispersed. LDHIs are the most expensive hydrate inhibitors by
per-gallon cost, even though the volume needed to be injected is far
lower as compared to the other chemical inhibitors, but LDHI still
makes up a huge amount as according to the previous work,11 the optimum amount of LDHI used 1 gal/bbl. of
water produced. Therefore, a cheaper and economical hydrate inhibitor
is necessary to be developed. Furthermore, due to the extended period
of shut-ins (2 weeks), an LDHI would not be able to inhibit hydrate
plug formation.27 Overall, existing LDHIs
do not meet all of the operational, performance, and cost demands,
so new approaches are required.

The aim of this study was to
explore an alternative approach to
chemical inhibition using a ferrofluid as a coating to create a liquid–liquid
interface that can prevent the adhesion of hydrates. This could be
applied in high-risk areas such as low spots of the tubing and pipeline.
The application of the ferrofluid in the pipeline can be done by pumping
the fluid into the gas pipeline, and once the magnetic fluid reaches
the designated low spot, magnets that are placed on the outer part
of the pipeline will attract the fluid onto the inner wall of the
pipeline, creating a liquid–liquid interface, preventing the
adhesion of hydrates. The concept is further illustrated in Figure 1. In the event of
pigging operations, the magnetic fluid can be easily removed from
the inner pipeline surface without unsettling the magnets on the outer
wall of the pipeline.

Figure 1 Illustration of application of a magnetic slippery surface
in a
gas pipeline.

The magnetic slippery surface
used in this study was created using
a ferrofluid, which consists of finely dispersed magnetic particles
in a carrier fluid, a conventional liquid with magnetic properties.28,29 The particles in the ferrofluid are dispersed uniformly through
the carrier liquid, even when a magnetic field or any other force
field is introduced.30 This permits the
application of ferrofluids in many fields such as ferrofluid sealing,
heat transfer enhancement, magnetic separation, biomedicine, and inertia
damping.31 There are a variety of ferrofluids
that have been prepared, which include hydrocarbon-based, water-based,
organic-liquid-based, and silicon-oil-based ferrofluids. This study
focuses on hydrocarbon-based ferrofluids. In addition, ferrofluids
have been investigated to prevent ice adhesion by forming an icephobic
coating,28 where the ferrofluid was extremely
effective. The magnetic field does not only form an icephobic surface
with the ferrofluid but also locks the ferrofluid in place. By locking
the ferrofluid in place, the magnetic fluid is able to withstand high
shear stresses from the production flow. Furthermore, production costs
can be lowered using hydrocarbon-based magnetic fluid due to the low
evaporation rate, which increases the longevity of the magnetic fluid.32 With the use of ferrofluids, a significant investment
must be provided to coat the low spot of the pipeline with the magnetic
fluid, but when compared in the long term, the cost of hydrate inhibition
will be lower. In a further study,33 a
hydrocarbon-based ferrofluid was employed as an antiscaling magnetic
slippery surface. Using a hydraulic circuit to test the magnetic fluid
portrayed prominent results where the formed scale did not adhere
to the pipe wall.33 The results from the
above work33 also support the conclusion
made by Irajizad et al.28 as well as convey
the excellent antiscaling property of ferrofluids.

For this
study, a hydrocarbon-based ferrofluid was used as a magnetic
slippery surface for inhibiting the adhesion of hydrates onto steel
substrates due to the interface between the hydrate and the ferrofluid.
The self-healing properties and the ability of the magnetic field
to latch the magnetic fluid in place enable the longevity of the ferrofluid
and the fluid to overcome high shear stress, respectively.29,34 More importantly, the magnetic fluid can be applied under conditions
of shear. However, the fluid can deplete over time; therefore, a ferrofluid
gel was also used to prevent the loss of the coating.33−35 The ferrofluid coating was studied with a model hydrate using tetrahydrofuran
(THF), which is commonly used for testing KHIs.23,28,36 Ideally, the ferrofluid would be tested
under pressure, but that is nontrivial, and a specially designed system
would be required, which is why THF hydrates were used. THF hydrates
have been used in numerous studies as a model for hydrate formation.
The use of THF hydrates is due to the simplicity of producing and
handling the hydrates formed as this is only a preliminary test to
determine the adhesion inhibition of ferrofluids.37−47

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Tetrahydrofuran (99% inhibitor
free) and polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. An oil-based ferrofluid with
a density of 1.21 g/cm3 was used, which consisted of iron
oxide, oil-soluble dispersants, and hydrotreated light was purchased
from Ferrotec Inc. The magnetic fluid used has flash and boiling points
of 95 and 223 °C, respectively. The precise composition of the
ferrofluid mixture is proprietary information, but the general composition
is as shown in Table 1.

2.2 Preliminary Test Procedure
to Determine the
Antiadhesion Properties
First, an experiment was conducted
to prove that the ferrofluid has a good icephobic surface. Hence,
a droplet of distilled water (30 μL) was placed on a 7 ×
0.5 cm2 N52 neodymium magnet coated with the ferrofluid
and placed in a freezer at −5 °C for 30 min. The magnet
was then removed and tilted at various angles to see whether there
was any solid–liquid interface formed due to the adhesion of
the formed ice to the surface of the magnet.

Tetrahydrofuran
(THF) hydrate was then used. THF is miscible with water and forms
hydrates at temperatures below 4.4 °C and atmospheric pressure
when a solution of 19.1% THF (by weight) in water is used.7 Therefore, a droplet of 19.1% THF solution was
placed on a 7 × 0.5 cm2 N52 neodymium magnet. The
magnet along with the droplet was then placed in the freezer at −5
°C for 30 min. The magnet was then removed and tilted at various
angles. The experiment was then repeated by coating the surface of
the neodymium magnet with the ferrofluid and diesel oil separately.

2.3 Mechanical Test of THF Hydrates
This
test was performed to determine how much force was required to overcome
the adhesion between the hydrate and the ferrofluid. A mold was created
by pouring 50 mL of distilled water in a steel cylinder along with
steel wires and placed into the freezer at −15 °C for
3 h. A total of 25 mL of 19.1 wt % THF solution was then added with
a cuboid neodymium magnet (7 × 0.5 × 0.5 cm3)
immersed at a depth of 0.5 cm and placed in the freezer for another
2 h. The mold was then inverted, and the open side of the magnet was
placed into 50 mL of distilled water with steel wires and placed in
the freezer for 3 h. The experimental configuration is shown in Figure 2. Water was then
added at 200 mL intervals into the pail until the magnet broke off
from the mold.

Figure 2 Schematic of the experimental configuration that was used
to examine
the force needed to overcome the hydrate adhesion force.

The volume of water was recorded and converted to the force
required
to overcome the hydrate adhesion force using Formula 1. 1  where F denotes the force,
ρ is the density of water used, Vl is the volume of water needed to overcome the adhesion force, mp is the mass applied to the coating, mice is the mass of the bottom mold, and g is the gravitational constant. The experiment was then
repeated by varying the immersion depth of the neodymium magnet bar
and later coating the neodymium magnet with the ferrofluid.

2.4 Torque Measurement of THF Hydrates on a Ferrofluid
Coating
This study was performed to examine the adhesion
inhibition properties of the ferrofluid under dynamic conditions (shear
flow). The experiment was carried out with the ferrofluid in both
liquid and gel forms. The gel ferrofluid was prepared by adding polystyrene-block-poly (ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (co-polymer) to the oil-based ferrofluid
at a ratio of 1:24 and preswollen for 20 h and then heated up at 120
°C for 2 h in an oven. The gel was prepared by stirring on a
hot plate at 110 °C for 1 h. The mixture was then cooled to room
temperature and later placed in an oven at 50 °C for 20 h. The
gel was then allowed to cool to room temperature.33 For the shear flow experiment, 30 mL of 19.1 wt % THF solution
was poured into a steel cylinder coated with 10 mL of the ferrofluid
liquid and placed in an insulated Styrofoam box filled with ice. An
overhead stirrer was then used to simulate a dynamic flow as the temperature
of the fluid decreased below the THF nucleating temperature. The torque
value was calculated by analyzing the change in revolutions per minute
(RPM) using Formula 2. 2  where T represents the torque, P is the power
supplied to the overhead stirrer, and ΔRPM
is the change in RPM from the initial value where 19.1 wt % THF was
stirred to the final value when hydrates had formed. The experiment
was then repeated by switching off the stirrer until the hydrate was
formed, which is approximately 1 h and then the stirrer was switched
on. This was done to test the adhesion inhibition properties of the
ferrofluid under shut-in conditions. The experiment was then repeated
by varying the amount of the liquid magnetic fluid coating and followed
by the magnetic fluid gel. The apparatus setup is as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Schematic of the experiment
configuration used to investigate the
adhesion inhibition properties of the ferrofluid and ferrofluid gel.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Preliminary Test on the Antiadhesion Property
of the Ferrofluid
This preliminary experiment was conducted
to prove the antiadhesion properties of ferrofluids under static conditions. Figure 4 shows the images
obtained from the experiments using water on neodymium magnets.

Figure 4 (A) Water droplet
on the ferrofluid-coated neodymium magnet; (B)
formed ice droplet on the ferrofluid-coated neodymium magnet.

Figure 4A,B shows
the formation of ice from the water droplet on the surface of the
magnetic fluid. Clearly, the ferrofluid does not prevent the formation
of ice, so the magnets were tilted to a maximum angle of 90°.
As can be seen from the images in Figure 5, at the angle of 90°, the ice formed
on the surface of the magnet does not drop, concluding that the adhesion
force of the ice onto the surface of the magnet is strong enough to
prevent the ice from falling. This is not surprising since ice adheres
strongly to surfaces. However, when the surface is coated with a ferrofluid,
the ice slides along the surface and falls onto the steel plate with
the slightest of movement, which is in line with previous research,28 where a magnetic slippery surface (ferrofluid)
is an excellent icephobic surface.

Figure 5 90° tilted ice droplet on a neodymium
magnet.

The experiment was repeated using
19.1 wt % tetrahydrofuran solution,
which showed that the ferrofluid does not prevent the nucleation of
hydrates, but when the magnet was tilted up to an angle of 90°
(Figure 6), the results
obtained were similar to the outcome of the water-only case where
the adhesion force is strong enough to prevent the hydrate from falling
off the magnet. When the test was repeated in the presence of a ferrofluid
coating, the hydrate did not stick to the surface of the magnet and
falls of as soon as the magnet is moved slightly. This demonstrated
that the ferrofluids do not prevent the formation of hydrates but
lower the adhesion of hydrates.

magnet.

The experiment was then repeated
by coating the neodymium magnet
with diesel oil as a control to eliminate the possibility of antiadhesion
due to hydrocarbons in the ferrofluid. The diesel-coated neodymium
magnet did not inhibit the formation of both hydrate and ice and the
experiment was continued with the tilting of the magnet to an angle
of 90° as shown in Figures 7 and 8.

Figure 7 90° inclined ice

Figure 8 90°
inclined THF hydrate on a diesel-coated neodymium magnet.

When the neodymium magnet was tilted at an angle of 90°
as
shown in Figures 9 and 10, both the hydrate and ice formed can be seen to
adhere strongly to the surface of the neodymium magnet. Hence, diesel
oil as a representative hydrocarbon35 is
a poor adhesion inhibitor and supports the initial claim of this research
that the magnetic properties (iron particles) contribute to the antiadhesion
properties of the fluid.

the ferrofluid.

liquid.

3.2 Mechanical
Test of THF Hydrates
To
quantify the strength of the adhesion between the hydrate and the
coating, a test was performed using the experimental configuration
shown in Figure 2. Figure 9 illustrates the
results obtained from testing the adhesion of hydrates. When the magnet
was immersed at depths of 0.5 and 1 cm, averages of 4 and 15 kg were
required to overcome the adhesion force the hydrate had on the magnet.

Meanwhile, when the magnet was immersed to 2 and 2.5 cm, 21 kg
of weight was insufficient to overcome the adhesion force between
the hydrate and the magnet. The maximum weight that could be used
was 21 kg, which was the volume limit experimental configuration;
in particular, the cable that connected the weight to the hydrate
failed. The main observation for these experiments without a ferrofluid
coating is the substantial force that is required to separate the
magnet from the hydrate mold. On the contrary, in the presence of
a ferrofluid coating on the neodymium magnet, the magnet did not adhere
to the hydrate as when removing the sample from the freezer, the magnetic-fluid-coated
magnet comes out with a minimal force. This indicates that a minimal
force was required to overcome the adhesion forces between the magnet
and the hydrate mold in the presence of the ferrofluid coating. Again,
this proves that the magnetic fluid is an excellent hydrate adhesion
inhibitor.

To have a better understanding of the effect of hydrate
adhesion,
the surface area that was adhered by the hydrate for each immersion
was calculated using the following procedure:1. The total surface area of the hydrate
adhered to the magnet was calculated using the below formula  where
∑S = the total
adhered surface area, cm2

; W =
the width of the magnet, cm (∼0.5 cm);

Δh = the depth of immersion, cm; and

L = the length of the magnet, cm (∼0.5
cm)

2. The average force
required to separate
the magnet from three repeat tests is shown in Table 1, where the force required to separate the
hydrate per surface area was calculated using the following formula

  where ∑S = the total
adhered surface area, cm2; F = the force
required to separate the neodymium magnet from the hydrate mold, N.

The results obtained are tabulated in Table 2.

Table 2 Force per Surface Area and Volume
for the Mechanical Test of THF Hydrates
depth of immersion Δh, cm	surface area, cm2	average force, N	force/surface area, N/cm2	
0.5	1.25	35.399	28.320	
1	2.25	143.427	63.745	
2	4.25	>206.010	>48.473	
2.5	5.25	>206.010	>48.473	
As seen in Table 2, the force per surface
area or pressure increases as the immersion
depth of the magnet increases in the absence of the ferrofluid. The
reason for the lower pressure value for the depth of immersion of
2 cm is justified due to the constraint mentioned previously. This
experiment demonstrates the amount of pressure required to detach
the hydrate from the walls of the pipeline.

When the magnet
was coated with the ferrofluid, a small amount
of force was required to detach the magnet, and this means that there
is minimal adhesion between the ferrofluid and the hydrates. This
offers a possible strategy to prevent hydrates from sticking to pipelines.
However, these experiments are under static conditions, so subsequent
experiments were performed under dynamic conditions.

3.3 Torque Measurement of THF Hydrates
The experiment was
conducted under shear flow (flowing), and a shut-in
condition was simulated by stopping the stirring. The amount of the
ferrofluid required to prevent hydrate adhesion was determined under
these conditions. The torque value obtained is the direct representation
of the level of the adhesion of hydrates; the higher the torque value,
the higher the force required for the stirrer to rotate. This is due
to the formation of THF hydrates in the steel cylinder and adherence
to the wall forming a solid and hence preventing the stirrer to rotate.
The results are tabulated for flowing and shut-in conditions in Tables 3 and 4 and the results are plotted in Figures 10 and 11, respectively.

As illustrated in Figures 10 and 11, when the
amount of the ferrofluid
increases in both cases, the change in RPM is lower, resulting in
lower torque requirement. This proves that using the ferrofluid as
a liquid–liquid interface hydrate adhesion can be prevented
when the correct amount of the magnetic fluid is used. When the amount
of the ferrofluid was too low, the ferrofluid was not able to coat
the steel cylinder completely with the hydrate adhering to the uncoated
surface. When the amount of the ferrofluid was increased, the surface
area for hydrate adhesion decreased, but some of the liquid ferrofluid
was found detached and mixed with the THF solution and forming dispersed
hydrates. This is because the shear force acting on the ferrofluid
from the stirring process is higher than the magnetic force acting
on the ferrofluid liquid. This causes an inaccurate reading of the
RPM measurements. At the end of the experiment, there were hydrates
adhering to the wall of the steel cylinder, indicating that most of
the magnetic fluid had mixed with the 19.1 wt % THF solution. Hence,
a more viscous ferrofluid gel was used, and the readings are as shown
in Tables 5 and 6. The data is also illustrated in Figures 12 and 13.

30	0.34	34.38	no adhesion of hydrates	
As shown in Figures 12 and 13, the torque required
in the
presence of the ferrofluid gel is much lower than the torque required
in the presence of the ferrofluid liquid. This is due to the fact
that the co-polymer used to thicken the magnetic fluid prevents the
ferrofluid from mixing with the THF solution, ensuring that the surface
area of the steel cylinder is completely coated with the antiadhesive
coating for longer periods. The previous research with ice also confirmed
these observations where a more viscous magnetic fluid reduced the
loss of fluid.33 In Figures 12 and 13, the minimum
torque required is 34 N cm when 25 mL and 30 mL of the ferrofluid
gel are used during shut-in conditions, and the minimum torque required
is 35 N cm during flowing conditions due to the mass of the hydrate
block formed adhering to the overhead stirrer.

Furthermore,
from the experiment conducted, the amount of the ferrofluid
required per cubic centimeter was also obtained. Using the ferrofluid
liquid alone, the required volume cannot be determined as the more
the magnetic fluid used, the more the magnetic fluid was lost to the
shear force. In Figures 11 and 12, the appropriate amount of
the magnetic gel required is approximately 25 mL for a surface area
of 86 cm2. This means that a ratio of 1:3 of the surface
area of steel to magnetic liquid is required to completely coat the
surface, ensuring optimum adhesion prevention from the deposition
of hydrates.

4 Conclusions and Recommendation
This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that a ferrofluid can
be used to prevent hydrate adhesion to a metal surface. The studies
were conducted at atmospheric pressure, and under these conditions,
the ferrofluid shows promising performance as an alternative to prevent
the adhesion of hydrates in pipelines. The liquid form of the magnetic
slippery surface shows exceptional antiadhesion characteristics under
static and dynamic conditions, but the long-term stability is an issue.
Therefore, when the system is gelled, the coating is more durable.
Further tests will focus on high-pressure conditions that simulate
conventional field operations more closely where the presence of produced
hydrocarbons may dilute the gel or the liquid. Hence, sensitivity
analysis of the optimum carrier fluid to be used with the iron particles
could be carried out. In addition, the effect of the shear stress
and strain that the hydrocarbon flow may impose on the ferrofluid
can be further investigated by utilizing the flow loop apparatus.
