Based
on the fact that β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) can solubilize
readily in water and bind many small hydrophobic molecules, a novel
nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg was developed by an antisolvent
precipitation method. After binding to β-lg, the solubility
of glabridin in aqueous solution was enhanced 21 times. Fluorescence
spectroscopy of β-lg revealed that the interaction of glabridin
with β-lg made the environment of Trp and Tyr residues on β-lg
more hydrophilic. The morphology and crystal form of the nanocomplexed
glabridin with β-lg was characterized and the changes in β-lg
conformation was also been investigated. In combination with molecular
docking modeling, the results revealed that glabridin was bound to
β-lg by hydrophobic forces and hydrogen-bond interactions. Furthermore,
the nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg had a better 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
radical-scavenging capacity and 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid radical-scavenging capacity compared to free glabridin at the
same concentration during in vitro tests. Thus, nanocomplexing with β-lg,
by virtue of its ability to enhance the solubility of glabridin in
aqueous systems, provides a suitable opportunity as a nanocarrier
molecule.

==== Body
Introduction
Glabridin (Figure 1a) is an isoflavonoid
found in the roots of Glycyrrhiza
glabra L. (Favaceae), commonly known as licorice.1 A wide range of pharmacological properties of
glabridin have been reported, including antioxidation,2,3 inhibiting melanogenesis,4,5 anti-inflammation,6 estrogen-like activity, antiproliferative activity
in regards to cancer cells,7,8 enhancing memory,9 etc. Glabridin has significant applications in
food, dietary supplements, and cosmetic markets. However, the practical
application of glabridin is extremely limited owing to its poor aqueous
solubility and, thus, poor bioavailability, as well as its unpredictable
stability.10

Figure 1 (a) Chemical structure
of glabridin and (b) three-dimensional structure
of β-lactoglobulin.

β-Lactoglobulin (β-lg, Figure 1b) is a bovine whey protein that has been
one of the most extensively investigated proteins due to its abundant
presence. It is consists of a polypeptide chain of 162 amino acid
residues and exhibits an average molecular weight of 18 400
Da, with a isoelectric point (pI) about pH 5.1–5.2.11 This small globular protein belongs to the lipocalin
family12 and has a three-dimensional structure
that constitutes a hydrophobic pocket consisting of eight strands
of antiparallel β-sheet twisted into a cone-shaped barrel.13 The special hydrophobic pocket structure provides
a high-affinity environment to small hydrophobic ligands such as lipid,14,15 fatty acid,16−18 aromatic compounds,19,20 and lipophilic
vitamins.21,22 Besides, there are also some other reported
binding sites on β-lg, such as the hydrophobic groove between
β-helix and β-barrel outer surface, the outer surface
site near the bottom of calyx in close proximity to Trp19 and Arg124,23,24 and near the cleft of dimerization interface.25 As a naturally occurring polymer, β-lg exhibits a
low toxicity and better biocompatibility and biodegradability compared
to synthetic polymers.26 Hence, β-lg
is an attractive candidate as a natural nanocarrier for delivering
important hydrophobic nutrients.

The purpose of the present
study was to characterize the interactions
of glabridin with β-lg to make a contribution to deeper understanding
of the molecular recognition properties of this lipocalin. The stability
and structural behavior of gliabridin complexing with β-lg were
investigated under different conditions such as pH, ionic strength,
and temperature and examined first by fluorescence spectroscopy. Then,
to obtain an in-depth understanding of binding mechanism at the molecular
level, the interactions of glabridin with β-lg were investigated
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD),
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), circular dichroism
(CD), and molecular docking. The solubility of the nanocomplexed glabridin
with β-lg in pure water was examined. In addition, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
(DPPH) radical-scavenging capacity and 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid (ABTS) radical-scavenging capacity of the formed nanocomplexed
glabridin with β-lg were tested and compared to free glabridin.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Glabridin (95% purity) was purchased from
Hunan Jiamu Biotechnology (Hunan, China). β-lg (90% in purity)
was obtained from Energy Chemical (Shanghai, China). 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
radical (DPPH, 96% in purity) and 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid (ABTS, 98% in purity) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company
(Shanghai, China). All other reagents were of analytical grade and
used without further purification.

High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography Analysis
Reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC, CBM-102 communications
bus module with a SPD-10A UV–vis detector) was used to quantify
glabridin. Separation was carried on a Diamonsil C18 analytical column
(4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm) with acetonitrile–2% acetic
acid (50:50, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
The ultraviolet (UV) detection wavelength was 282 nm.

Preparation
of Amorphous Nanocomplexed Glabridin with β-lg
A simple
antisolvent precipitation method was adopted to prepare
the amorphous nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg. Briefly, 300
mg of β-lg was completely dissolved in 100 mL phosphate-buffered
saline buffer (pH 7.4) as the antisolvent phase and 40 mg of glabridin
was completely dissolved in 10 mL ethanol as the solvent phase. Initially,
both the solvent and antisolvent phases were cooled to 4 °C.
After that, the solvent phase was added to the antisolvent phase while
continuously stirring at 800 rpm for 60 min at room temperature. The
resulting suspension was exposed to ultrasonic waves for 15 min. Finally,
the sample was evaporated under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator
at 40 °C to remove the solvent.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The binding and alignment
of glabridin with β-lg was investigated by fluorescence spectrophotometry,
according to the method of Liang et al.19 Protein fluorescence was measured at a constant β-lg concentration
(10 μM) in the presence of glabridin at various concentrations
(0–40 μM) following acclimatization at 37 °C in
a water bath for 20 min. The excitation and emission slit widths were
5 nm. Emission spectra were recorded over a range from 300 to 500
nm at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm by employing a Shimadzu RF
5000 spectrofluorimeter. Buffer and ligand backgrounds were subtracted
from the raw spectra. Moreover, variables including pH (3.0, 5.2,
7.4, and 10.0), temperature (25, 40, 50, and 60 °C), and ionic
strength (0, 100, 200, 300, and 400 mM), which effected the binding
fluorescence spectra of glabridin and β-lg, were also studied.

Solubility Study
Excess amount of glabridin (10 mg)
or nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg (20 mg) were added into
1 mL of water. The suspensions were then stirred at 37 °C for
72 h. After that, the samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm
membrane filter to remove excess insoluble substances and the filtrate
was diluted with ethanol. The amount of glabridin dissolved was calculated
using RP-HPLC.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The surface morphologies
of glabridin, β-lg, the physical mixture, and the nanocomplexed
glabridin with β-lg were recorded using a HITACHI S-4700 scanning
electron microscope (Japan). All the samples were fixed on a brass
stub using double-sided adhesive tape and then sputter coated with
a thin layer of gold for electric conductivity before analysis.

X-ray Diffractometry (XRD)
The X-ray diffraction patterns
of glabridin, β-lg, the physical mixture, and the nanocomplexed
glabridin with β-lg were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer
(D8 ADVANCE, Germany, Bruker) equipped with a copper target X-ray
tube. The voltage and current applied were set at 40 kV and 40 mA,
respectively. All the samples were measured over a diffraction angle
of 2θ ranging from 5 to 40° at a scan rate of 10°/min
and a step size of 0.2°.

Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FT-IR)
FT-IR
spectra of glabridin, β-lg, the physical mixture, and the nanocomplexed
glabridin with β-lg were measured on a FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet
6700) equipped with a DLaTGS detector. The spectral measurements were
carried out in the range of 4000 and 400 cm–1 with
the KBr disk method.

Circular Dichroism (CD)
Circular
Dichroism (CD) spectra
in the wavelength range 200–325 nm were recorded on a Jasco
J-810 spectropolarimeter and the measurements were carried out using
a 1 mm path length quartz cell. An average of three scans at a speed
of 50 nm/min with a bandwidth of 1 nm and a response time of 0.125
s were recorded. The concentration of β-lg used was 0.2 mg/mL,
and buffer background was subtracted from the raw spectra.

Molecular
Docking Study
In this study, a docking study
was carried out to visualize the binding configuration of glabridin
to β-lg using the AutoDock empirical free energy scoring function
and the Lamarckian genetic algorithm with local search. The docked
conformations of nanocomplexes were generated using the AutoDock 4.2.6
program package. The structure of β-lg was taken from RSCB protein
data bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). The AutoDock Tools 1.5.6 graphical interface was used to remove
water molecules from the structure of β-lg and to add polar
hydrogen atoms and partial charges using Gasteiger charges. Then,
the entire β-lg molecule was considered to be the search space,
and the center of the grid box was determined with a grid spacing
of 0.375 Å to allow the ligand to rotate freely.

DPPH Radical-Scavenging
Capacity
DPPH free radical-scavenging
capacities of glabridin and nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg
were evaluated according to the method of Shimada et al.27 Briefly, 2 mL aqueous solution of the test samples
(glabridin or nanocomplex) of various concentrations (0.5, 1, 4, 6,
10, and 13 μg/mL) were added to 2 mL ethanol solution of DPPH
radical (2 × 10–4 mol/L) and then the mixtures
were incubated in the dark for 30 min after vortexing. The decrease
in the absorbance at 517 nm was measured using a UV-2450 spectrophotometer
(Shimadzua, Japan) against an ethanol blank. The scavenging capacity
of the samples (SA %) on DPPH were calculated according to the equation  where Ai is the
absorbance of the mixture of 2 mL DPPH solution and 2 mL test sample
solution, Aj is the absorbance of the
mixture of 2 mL test sample solution and 2 mL ethanol, and A0 is the absorbance of the mixture of 2 mL DPPH
solution and 2 mL ethanol.

ABTS Radical-Scavenging Capacity
The ABTS radical-scavenging
activity was measured as described by Li et al.,28 with some modifications. The ABTS solution was produced
by mixing 0.2 mL ABTS diammonium salt (7.4 mM) with 0.2 mL ammonium
persulfate (2.6 mM). The mixture was kept in the dark at room temperature
for 12 h to allow completion of radical generation and then diluted
with ethanol until its absorbance at 734 nm was near 0.74 ± 0.03.
To determine the scavenging activity, 0.6 mL aliquot of ABTS reagent
was mixed with 150 μL of the sample ethanolic solutions (2–20
μg/mL). After incubation for 6 min, the absorbance at 734 nm
was measured on a spectrophotometer. The percentage inhibition of
the samples was calculated as  where A0 is the
absorbance at 734 nm without the test sample, whereas A is the absorbance at 734 nm with the test sample.

Statistical
Analysis
All the analytical experiments
were carried out in three replicates and the results were presented
as a mean ± standard deviation. One-way analysis of variance
was employed to identify significant differences (p < 0.05) between the data sets using the software Origin 8.5.

Results and Discussion
Fluorescence Spectra of β-lg with Glabridin
Bound
Proteins possess endogenous fluorescence due to the
existence of
chromophoric groups on a variety of amino acids such as phenylalanine,
tyrosine, and tryptophan. The maximum emission wavelength of various
amino residues on proteins are related to the hydrophobicity of their
own microenvironment. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity of any
fluorescent substance is reduced in the presence of a fluorescent
quencher such as glabridin. Therefore, the migration of the wavelength
can be used as a basis for judging whether the conformation of the
protein changes.29Figure 2 shows the fluorescence emission spectra
of β-lg in the presence of different concentrations of glabridin.
The intensity of the fluorescence emission of β-lg at around
325 nm gradually decreased and upshifted to 334 nm with an increase
in the glabridin concentration. Because β-lg has two tryptophan
and four tyrosine residues in its monomeric state that contribute
to the fluorescence, this result indicated that the interaction of
glabridin with β-lg made the environment of Trp and Tyr residues
more hydrophilic.30

Figure 2 Fluorescence emission
spectra of β-lg in the presence of
glabridin at different concentrations at the excitation wavelengths
of 280 nm in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 (a → f: 0, 5,
10, 20, 30, and 40 μM glabridin) at constant β-lg (10
μM).

The fluorescence spectra of the
nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg
under different conditions is shown in Figure S1. As the pH of β-lg solution increased from 3.0 to
7.4, a decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed, while an increase
at pH 10.0 (Figure S1a). This may be due
to the transformation in the β-lg structure above pH 7 exposes
more of the tyrosine and tryptophan residues.31 Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity of the nanocomplexed glabridin
with β-lg decreased with an increasing ionic strength (Figure S1b), whereas the fluorescence intensity
increased with an increase in temperature (Figure S1c). These changes in protein fluorescent intensities may
be related to the increasing structural stability the β-lg form
a stable nanocomplex in high ionic strength32 and changes in conformation of β-lg at elevated temperatures,
affecting the binding efficiency of glabridin.

Water Solubility
According to the HPLC result (Figure S2 and Table S1, the Supporting Information),
the calibration curve was linear over
the range of 20–100 μg/mL with a correlation coefficient
of R2 > 0.9998. The solubility measurements
showed that the solubility of the nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg
in deionized water was 0.231 ± 0.03 mg/mL, representing an increase
of about 21 times compared to that of raw glabridin (0.011 ±
0.02 mg/mL). Thus, the solubility of glabridin was improved after
complexing with β-lg. Aditya et al.33 reported similar results in regards to the complexing of β-lg
with curcumin. Hence, our results further contribute to a deeper understanding
of β-lg as an attractive natural carrier for delivering important
hydrophobic nutrients in aqueous systems.

Morphology and Crystal
Form of Nanocomplexed Glabridin with
β-lg
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed
to visualize the surface morphology of glabridin, β-lg, the
physical mixture, and the nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg
(Figure 3). Pure glabridin
(Figure 3a) displayed
prismatic crystals, whereas β-lg (Figure 3b) showed a blocky crystal morphology with
many different sizes. Both individual crystal forms of glabridin and
β-lg were observed in the SEM images of their physical mixture
(Figure 3c). However,
the nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg (Figure 3d) appeared as structurally distinct not
only from the free components but also from the physical mixture,
confirming the formation of a new solid phase. This was similar with
earlier result that has shown that β-lg had a marked effect
on the morphology of micromolecule after the formation of the nanocomplex.34

β-lg,
(c) the physical mixture, and (d) nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg.

Further evidence of the formation
of the nanocomplexed glabridin
with β-lg was provided by the XRD analysis. The XRD patterns
of glabridin, β-lg, the physical mixture, and the nanocomplexed
glabridin with β-lg are shown in Figure 4. Glabridin in its raw form (Figure 4a) exhibited strong and characteristic
peaks at angles 8.5, 14.7, 16.2, 17.8, and 19.5, consistent with previous
reports;35 however, no distinct peaks were
detected in the XRD patterns of β-lg (Figure 4b). Instead, the XRD patterns of β-lg
showed a broad baseline signal not atypical for proteins.36 In the diffraction peaks of the physical mixture,
glabridin and β-lg showed identical peak pattern to that of
glabridin in its pure form, but at a lowered intensity (Figure 4c). This lowered intensity
could be due to the fact that the presence of proteins (β-lg)
partially hindered the transmission of the X-rays. Conversely, the
nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg showed no evidence of the
XRD pattern associated with pure glabridin (Figure 4d). Instead, the signal was more typical
of the XRD pattern of the β-lg XRD spectrum (Figure 4b) and that of proteins in
their amorphous state,37 which essentially
translates in the total absence of any diffraction peaks corresponding
to raw glabridin. This outcome may be the result of the complete nanocomplexing
of free glabridin with β-lg, causing the absence of a typical
set of diffraction peaks corresponding to glabridin.

Conformation of β-Lactoglobulin
Loaded with Glabridin
FT-IR spectroscopy is a valuable method
to monitor changes in the
secondary structure of proteins and their dynamics when interacting
with other compounds.38,39 The FT-IR spectra of glabridin,
β-lg, the physical mixture, and the nanocomplexed glabridin
with β-lg are shown in Figure 5. Glabridin (Figure 5a) is characterized by distinct absorption peaks at
3340 cm–1 (for O–H stretching vibration),
1520 and 1480 cm–1 (for C=C stretching vibration
in aromatic ring), 2970, 2920, and 1370 cm–1 (for
CH3 group), and 1270 cm–1 (for stretching
of C–O–C). The peak position of the amide-I band of
β-lg (Figure 5b) occurred at 1647 cm–1 (for C=O stretching,
and representing an α-helix structure) and its amide-II was
displayed at 1539 cm–1 (C–N stretching coupled
with N–H bending mode, and representing antiparallel β-sheet
structures).40 The FT-IR of the physical
mixture (Figure 5c)
was simply the superposition of the spectra of the individual component.
The FT-IR spectrum of the nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg
(Figure 5d) showed
a similar spectrum to the β-lg protein with the disappearance
of glabridin, which was consistent with the XRD result. The peak position
of β-lg shifted to 1639 cm–1 for amide-I and
1551 cm–1 for amide-II after interaction with glabridin
signal. These results indicate a complex formation between β-lg
and glabridin, following changes in the secondary structure and chemical
microenvironments on the β-lg protein. Similar results were
observed during the interaction between β-lg and the aliphatic
compound bixin.41

Figure 5 FT-IR spectra of (a)
glabridin, (b) β-lg, (c) the physical
mixture, and (d) the nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg.

To investigate the specific changes
in the secondary structure
of β-lg, both Omnic 8.0 and Peakfit 4.12 were employed to interpret
the differences between the FT-IR data of pure β-lg protein
and the nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg in the range of 1600–1700
cm–1. The content of α-helix almost did not
change, with β-sheet and β-turn decreasing 3.8 and 2.8%,
respectively (Table S2). And, the content
of random coli increased 6.5%. This result confirmed that the conformation
of β-lg changed after reacting with glabridin. The secondary
structure of β-lg became loosen at the existence of glabridin’s
steric hindrance, which benefit to form hydrogen bonds between those
two molecules and exposure the sleeping residues of protein.

Circular dichroism (CD) has been proven to be a useful technique
to examine conformational changes that occur in the secondary structures
of protein42 as a result of changes in
the microenvironmental conditions such as those caused by the binding/complexing
of ligands.43 Glabridin does not exhibit
any CD bands in the aqueous solution (Figure S3). The CD spectrum of pure β-lg revealed a broad band with
a minimum at 218 nm, which is characteristic of the presence of a
prominent β-structure.43 Following
the nanocomplexing with glabridin, the band associated with the β-structure
shifted to a higher wavelength of around 239 nm and the minimum became
narrower and more negative. Furthermore, there were minor residual
bands at 221 and 230 nm, which might be the evidence of the presence
of noncomplexed β-lg. Changes in the CD spectra (Figure 6) suggest that the binding
of β-lg with glabridin changed the secondary structures of β-lg,44 which is consistent with the FT-IR result.

conformation and detailed view of the nanocomplexed
glabridin with β-lg.

Molecular Docking Studies
To get further insight into
and explain the experimental results obtained, a molecular modeling
study was carried out using the AutoDock 4.2.6 software package to
determine the potential mode of interaction between glabridin and
β-lg. The proposed nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg geometry
showing the lowest energy is displayed in Figure 6. The inhibition constant and free energy
of the binding of glabridin to β-lg were 883.92 nM and −8.26
kcal/mol, respectively. The molecular modeling also indicated that
nine amino acid residues were involved in the docking of glabridin
with β-lg. These included Ala139, Ala142, Met7, and Leu9, all
of which possess hydrophobic residues and were very closely aligned
with glabridin, meaning that there was substantial hydrophobic interaction
between β-lg and glabridin. Furthermore, the three hydrogen
bonds facilitated interactions between glabridin and β-lg. Specifically,
2′-OH and 4′-OH groups of the aromatic ring of the glabridin
bonded with O atom of Ala139 and Thr4 of β-lg, respectively,
where the OH group functioned as a hydrogen bond donor and the respective
amino acid acted as the hydrogen bond acceptor; 1″-O of glabridin
bonded with an amino group of Lys8 of β-lg, where the Lys was
the hydrogen bond donor and O atom was the hydrogen bond acceptor.
Based on our molecular modeling, it can be deduced that the interaction
of glabridin with β-lg is not only via hydrophobic interactions
but also through hydrogen bond formation.

In Vitro Bioactivity Assay
Natural compounds like flavonoids
that possess potent antioxidant activity are strong scavengers of
free radicals.45 To evaluate the effectiveness
of glabridin after nanocomplexing with β-lg as an antioxidant,
the DPPH and ABTS radical-scavenging capacities were carried out.
The DPPH radical-scavenging capacities of free glabridin and nanocomplexed
glabridin with β-lg are shown in Figure 7a. The results indicate that increasing the
concentration of glabridin in the range of 0.5–13 μg/mL
increases the scavenging capacities of both free and nanocomplexed
glabridin. More specifically, the nanocomplexed glabridin asserted
a greater radical-scavenging capacity compared to free glabridin alone.
The ABTS radical-scavenging capacities of both free and nanocomplexed
glabridin are shown in Figure 7b. The free radical clearance of free glabridin was 71.1%,
whereas that of the nanocomplexed glabridin was 80.3% under the same
concentration (12 μg/mL). Hence, both DPPH and ABTS radical-scavenging
tests revealed that the nanocomplexed glabridin retained and even
improved the free radical-scavenging capacity of glabridin (Figure 7a,b). The slight
increase in the free radical-scavenging of the nanocomplexed glabridin
maybe due to the notion that β-lg could control glabridin dosage,
thus protecting glabridin against rapid oxidation by free radical
and prolonging its antioxidant activity.

Figure 7 (a) DPPH radical-scavenging
capacities and (b) ABTS radical-scavenging
capacities of pure glabridin and the nanocomplexed glabridin with
β-lg.

In conclusion, β-lg
was used to as a carrier to encapsulate
glabridin with a simple method of an antisolvent precipitation. In
this study, changes in the β-lg fluorescence spectrum showed
that the inclusion of glabridin made the microenvironment of the β-lg
protein more hydrophobic. The results of SEM, XRD, FT-IR, CD, and
molecular docking revealed that the nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg
was in amorphous form and the conformation of β-lg was changed
after complexing with β-lg. Both hydrophobic interactions and
hydrogen bonding contributed to the successful interaction between
β-lg and glabridin. Based on the data obtained from in vitro
bioactivity assay, nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg retained
its DPPH radical-scavenging capacity and its ABTS radical-scavenging
capacity. Thus, β-lg can be considered as a good carrier and
the nanocomplexed glabridin with β-lg could be a useful model
of the drug–protein interaction. It would contribute to a deeper
understanding of the molecular recognition properties of this lipocalin.
