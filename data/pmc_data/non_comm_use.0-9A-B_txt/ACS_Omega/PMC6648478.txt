The motor dysfunction
featured by patients aggrieved by Parkinson’s
disease (PD) results from the reduction of dopamine (DA) availability
in the caudate nucleus (CN). Restituting CN DA levels is therefore
essential to ameliorate PD motor deficits. In this regard, nanotechnology
may offer solutions to restore CN DA availability. DA, however, can
be rapidly oxidized into toxic compounds if made available in situ,
unprotected. Then, we tested whether a semicrystalline TiO2 lattice, implanted into the CN of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned,
hemiparkinsonian rats, was able to release DA during a time window
sufficient to attenuate motor symptoms while protecting it from the
ongoing oxidation. Accordingly, implanted semicrystalline TiO2 lattices released incremental amounts of DA into the CN of
lesioned rats. Motor symptoms were already attenuated by the 1st month
and significantly reduced 2 months after implantation. These effects
were specific since TiO2 lattices alone did not modify
motor symptoms in lesioned rats. DA-unloaded or -loaded TiO2 lattices did not produce obvious symptoms of systemic or neurological
toxicity nor significantly increased CN lipid peroxidation in implanted,
lesioned rats at the time of sacrifice. Our results thus support that
loaded TiO2 lattices are capable of releasing DA while
protecting it from the ongoing oxidation when implanted into the brain.
Their implantation does not cause noticeable systemic or local toxicity.
On the contrary, they attenuated motor symptoms in hemiparkinsonian
rats.

1 Introduction
Parkinson’s
disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative
disorder that typically becomes symptomatic in people over 40 years
of age.1 It features a myriad of autonomic
and somatic signs and symptoms that worsen with disease progression.2 At intermediate stages, most of the people afflicted
by PD develop a motor syndrome characterized by tremor, akinesia,
and rigidity.3 This syndrome arises, in
part, as a result of a deficient modulation of the activity of the
corticostriatal excitatory input by dopamine (DA);4 in parkinsonian patients, DA concentration gradually decreases
in the caudate nucleus (CN) following the progressive degeneration
of dopaminergic projection neurons located in the substantia nigra
pars compacta (SNpc).5−7 Therefore, the restitution of DA concentrations in
the depleted CN must alleviate PD-related motor dysfunction. Accordingly,
the oral administration of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), a synthetic precursor of DA, attenuates motor dysfunction
in both PD patients6 and experimental animal
units that model PD, by increasing CN DA availability.8 Unfortunately, l-DOPA loses its pharmacological
actions with time as dopaminergic neuron death progresses;9 this pharmacological agent requires its enzymatic
conversion into DA by the corresponding enzymatic machinery located
in the still living dopaminergic neurons.10 Hence, other dopaminergic agonizts and nondopaminergic medications
(e.g., anticholinergic drugs) have been assessed. These agents have
had a limited clinical success when used chronically.11

Based on the previous discourse line, the restitution
of CN DA
levels still is the most sensible way to therapeutically approach
PD motor symptoms. Oxidative processes following their release from
nerve terminals, nonetheless, rapidly inactivate DA. This process
is not inert but potentially harmful since it gives rise to toxic
metabolites that increase neural damage.12,13 Consequently, therapeutic approaches aimed at reducing PA motor
symptoms must ensure providing DA in concentrations sufficient to
achieve their modulatory actions while avoiding its toxicity. Transplantation
of dopaminergic neurons obtained through different means has been
offered as an alternative treatment to deliver DA into CN from natural
sources. Even though cell grafts allow patients to recover some motor
control in the short term, long-term success is rather limited because
the implanted cells become diseased over time (reviewed14). Nanotechnological tools constitute another
stronghold of therapeutic resources. Particularly, nanohybrid composites
of dopamine, chitosan, and TiO2 have been synthesized by
sol–gel method and their release of the neurotransmitter has
been obtained by electrochemical determination and UV–vis absorbance
techniques.15 Furthermore, attempts have
been made to use nanostructured materials to deliver DA into the brain.
Jain et al. (1998)16 were among the first
to use DA entrapped in liposomes to ameliorate catatonia in rats,
following intraperitoneal administration. This work, nonetheless,
is short term, largely inferential, and provides no technical data
on brain liposome diffusion, DA levels, toxicity, and place specificity.
On a similar verge, Pichandy et al. (2010)17 used liposomes administered through the peritoneum to decrease PD-like
symptoms induced by haloperidol. However, this study is acute, the
specific entrance of dopamine into the CN is inferred and not confirmed,
the experimental animal unit chosen models some PD-like motor symptoms
with no association with neuronal death, DA oxidation is not evaluated,
and DA/liposome-related toxicity is not assessed. The work conducted
by Pillay et al. (2009),18 on the other
hand, tested the ability of a “nano-enabled [cellulose acetate
phthalate] scaffold device for the site-specific delivery of dopamine
(DA) as a strategy to minimize the peripheral side effects of conventional
forms of Parkinson’s disease therapy”. In this study,
DA release was monitored for up to 1 month, following intraparenchymal
implantation of the device into the frontal lobe of intact rats. Unfortunately,
this study was conducted in an animal experimental unit that does
not model PD, DA oxidation was not prevented or assessed, and the
toxicity of the device was untested. Most of the limitations highlighted
before with regard to previous studies were effectively overcome by
a pair of studies conducted by Trapani et al. (2011),19 who used chitosan nanoparticles as systemic DA carriers,
and by Pahuja et al. (2015),20 who used
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) to entrap DA. In both
cases, they succeeded in supplying in vivo DA in sufficient amount
to the striatum with low, local, and systemic toxic effects, following
intraperitoneal injections or intravenous infusions, respectively.
Unfortunately, Trapani et al. (2011)19 did
not test the therapeutic performance of DA/chitosan nanoparticles
in an experimental animal unit modeling Parkinson. Pahuja et al. (2015),20 on the other hand, did it. In fact, this group
reported, “These particles up-regulated and maintained the
dopamine levels in the striatum of through slow and sustained release.
This was accompanied by a decrease in dopamine receptor supersensitivity
and reversal of neurobehavioral deficits”. Although both works
undoubtedly represent significant advances in the field, they are
short term, a circumstance that limits the applicability of their
inferences on systemic and local toxicities, specificity, and therapeutic
potential when considering their long-term usage.

Having all
of these information in mind, the present work aimed
at evaluating the use of titanium dioxide (TiO2)-crafted
lattices as local DA storing/releasing implantable nanodevices. We
tested the ability of these lattices to release DA in sufficient amount
for a period appropriate to attenuate motor symptoms in 6-hydroxydopamine
(6-OHDA)-lesioned, hemiparkinsonian rats, an accepted animal experimental
unit to model PD motor symptoms. Because (1) unprotected, freed DA
may be rapidly metabolized to form toxic oxidative derivatives and
(2) TiO2 nanoparticles may cause oxidative damage, we monitor
lipid peroxidation as an index of local toxicity for both DA-unloaded
and -loaded matrices. Lastly, we preferred to test the effects of
TiO2 lattices after local administration to limit body
distribution, thus avoiding systemic toxicity and body accumulation
over time. Also, a reduced initial dose can be used since neither
organ-unspecific uptake is expected nor biological barriers must be
passed through. Overall, our results showed that TiO2 lattices
are physically stable and protect DA from oxidation. They also readily
release it after being implanted into the CN of hemiparkinsonian rats.
Motor deficits were greatly attenuated by DA release from the TiO2 lattices.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesizing and Loading Dopamine into the
TiO2 Lattice
DA-unloaded or -loaded TiO2 lattices were synthesized at room temperature, following the conventional
sol–gel method.21 Briefly, the working
solution was prepared by stirring titanium(IV) butoxide (Fluka) and
ethyl alcohol (1:14.1 molar ratio; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at room
temperature. A solution of ethyl alcohol in deionized water (1:1 molar
ratio; Hycel) was then dropped, and, after 15 min, a mixture of 1.11
mL of tetra-ethyleneglycol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.578 mL of crown ether
(15C5; Sigma-Aldrich) was finally added. The TiO2 solution
was stirred for 4 h at room temperature. The addition of 15C5 provided
an organic template,22 which, while binding
TiO2, favors the formation of nanometric crystalline zones
with anatase and rutile phases. In addition, we have previously found
that 15C5 also reduces the rate of DA oxidation.23 For DA-loaded lattices, dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich)
was dissolved (0.3 w/v %) in 10 mL of a TiO2 working solution
(TiO2 lattice); this mixture was stirred for 4 h at room
temperature in a light-protected jar. The final solution of DA-loaded
TiO2 lattices (TiO2/DA complex) acquired a yellowish
tint (Supporting Information, Figure S1A,B), a color that indicates that the DA’s enediol functional
group networked with TiO2 surface through a ligand-to-metal
charge-transfer interactions.24 No further
treatment was performed to the lattices before their implantation.

2.2 Physicochemical Analyses of Dopamine Antioxidative
Property of the TiO2 Lattice
2.2.1 Fourier
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR) Analyses
FTIR spectral analyses allowed us to evaluate
the antioxidative property of the TiO2 lattice. DA can
be rapidly oxidized to dopamine-quinone (DAq) and dopamine-chrome
(DAcr) when unprotected by the lattice. We identified the presence
of both oxidized DA species within the TiO2 lattice by
comparing the vibrational modes of the bonds established among the
atoms of the distinct DA species with those of the TiO2 lattice. FTIR spectra were obtained at different times following
DA loading of the TiO2 lattice with the aid of an FTIR
Spectrophotometer Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR, equipped with an attenuated
total reflection accessory using a range of 400–4000 cm–1 at room temperature. The measurements were directly
taken from liquid samples.

2.3 Structural
Analyses of Dopamine Antioxidative
Property of the TiO2 Lattice
2.3.1 High-Resolution
Transmission Electron Microscopy
(HRTEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analyses
We conducted
HRTEM and XRD analyses to determine the structure of the TiO2/DA complex and the size of TiO2 lattice crystalline nanoparticles.
The abilities of the TiO2/DA lattice to (1) protect DA
from being oxidized and (2) release it following a concentration gradient
partly depend upon its structural organization. In general, it is
expected that a “relatively loose” lattice formed by
amorphous and nanocrystalline phases combined would provide DA with
satisfactory protection and diffusion possibilities. The local structure
and crystal nanoparticle size of TiO2 lattices loaded or
not loaded with DA were determined by using HRTEM conducted in a JEM2010
FEG with a point-to-point resolution of 0.25 nm. For HRTEM images,
lattices were resuspended in ethanol and a drop of the mixture was
deposited on a copper grid. The diameter of 70 particles randomly
taken from three different samples was averaged to estimate the average
particle size. The structures of TiO2 lattices, whether
loaded or not loaded with DA, were evaluated by using XRD analyses.
Filmed liquid samples of the TiO2 lattices were placed
on glass wafers (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) and sprayed seven times at
a rate of 2700 rpm for 15 s using a spin coater (SCS G6P8). XRD diffraction
patterns were obtained by using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer
under a Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation. We used a step-scanning
mode with 0.02° steps in the 10–80° range in 2θ
and an integration time of 2 s.

2.4 Testing
in Vivo Dopamine Release from the
TiO2 Lattice
2.4.1 Animals
The
experiments described
below were conducted in young adult male Wistar rats (250–260
g) born and raised in the animal facility at the Instituto de Investigaciones
Biomédicas (IIB), Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México
(UNAM). Rats were caged individually in rooms having controlled illumination
(12 h light/12 h dark cycles), temperature (23 °C), and relative
humidity (50 ± 5%). Water and food were provided ad libitum.
Protocols of animal handling and experimentation were revised and
approved by the local animal rights committee at IIB, UNAM (CICUAL;
ID-221).

2.4.2 Animal Groups and Experimental
Procedures
Rats were subjected to stereotaxic surgeries aimed
at unilaterally
instilling, at the nigrostriatal pathway, ascorbic acid alone (AAc;
0.5 mg; Sigma-Aldrich; control group) or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA;
6 μg; Sigma-Aldrich; experimental group), each diluted in 5
μL of saline solution; 6-OHDA causes a retrograde degeneration
of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta
(SNpc), leading to a motor dysfunction associated with DA depletion
in the CN.25 Both AAc and 6-OHDA were administered
(10 μL) using pressure injections through a Hamilton syringe
at a rate of 1 μL/min. To reduce backflow, the syringe’s
needle was kept in place at the injection site for 20 min. To evaluate
the efficacy of 6-OHDA treatments, both AAc-treated (n = 4) and 6-OHDA-treated (n = 16) rats were subjected
to the turning behavior test following an intraperitoneal administration
of amphetamine (5 mg/kg of body weight; Sigma-Aldrich).25 For the case of 6-OHDA-treated rats, only those
having ≥200 turns per hour and have TH immunoreactivity significantly
reduced (see below) were included in the study. Turning behavior tests
were conducted in a custom-made, Plexiglas 60 cm diameter/45 cm height
cylinder placed under red light illumination; tests were all scheduled
to proceed between 9 and 12 AM. Turning sessions were recorded and
analyzed off-line. After ending the turning sessions, 6-OHDA-treated
rats were further subgrouped into those carrying DA (3.25 μg/L)-unloaded
(n = 8) or -loaded (n = 8) TiO2 lattices. From previous experiments, we determine that this
concentration is adequate to observe good responses, as will be shown.
DA-loaded or -unloaded TiO2 lattices were stereotaxically
introduced (5 μL) into the anterodorsal aspect of the caudate
nucleus at a rate of 1 μL/min through a 10 μL Hamilton
syringe. Surgery was conducted under anesthesia induced after intramuscular
injections of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg). Corneal
dryness was prevented using artificial tears. The stereotaxic coordinates
used for targeting the nigrostriatal pathway (AP = −4.5, ML
= −1.5, DV = −8.25) and the anterodorsal caudate nucleus
(AP = 0, ML = +3.2, DV = −4) were established based on the
Rat Brain Stereotaxic Atlas published by Paxinos et al.26 After surgery, rats were caged individually
in acrylic cages were they remained until further testing. Neither
analgesics nor antibiotics were required after the surgery. Finally,
two additional groups of animals were added to our experimental design.
They were unlesioned but carried DA-unloaded (n =
8) or -loaded (n = 8) TiO2 lattices. In
both cases, lattices were implanted as described above and kept in
the brain for 1 (n = 4/group) or 2 months (n = 4/group). The goal of these groups was to test systemic
and local implant toxicities through analyzing turning behavior and
the number of SNpc dopaminergic neuron number and CN lipoperoxidation,
respectively.

2.4.3 Immunocytochemistry
Immunocytochemical
studies were carried out to verify the degree of dopaminergic denervation
achieved after 6-OHDA treatments. The rats (n = 24)
used for carrying out these experiments were anesthetized with pentobarbital
(0.5 mg/kg of body weight) and perfused through the heart with saline
solution followed by a buffered solution of 4% paraformaldehyde. After
the perfusion, their brains were removed, cryopreserved in a buffered
solution containing 30% sucrose until they sank, frozen in 2-methyl-butane
prechilled with dry ice, and stored at −70 °C until use.
Cryostat sagittal brain slices (40 μm thick) were cut and incubated
with primary polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH; Cat. No. sc-14007; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted
1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 M; pH 7.4) and supplemented
with 0.3% Triton (PBSt) during 48 h at 4 °C. After a thorough
wash, slices were incubated with biotin-conjugated, secondary polyclonal
antibodies raised in goats against rabbit IgGs (Cat. No. BA-1000;
Vector Laboratories), diluted 1:200 in PBSt during 2 h at room temperature.
This step was followed by three washes in PBSt. Then, slices were
incubated with avidin–peroxidase as recommended by the supplier
(Standard Elite kit; Cat. No. PK-6100; Vector Laboratories) during
2 h at room temperature, washed in PBSt, and finally incubated with
a solution containing 2,2-diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide as
recommended by the supplier (Peroxidase substrate kit DAB; Cat. No.
SK-4100; Vector Laboratories). The slices were mounted onto gelatin-subbed
slides, counterstained with cresyl violet, and coverslipped with Cytoseal
60 (Cat. No. 8310-4; ThermoScientific). Slides were observed under
bright-field microscopy and representative digital photographs taken
at 10× using a Leica EZ4D stereomicroscope. Additionally, TH
immune-positive neurons were counted across six consecutive sections
of the SNpc obtained from brains of unlesioned (n = 3), 6-OHDA lesioned (n = 4), unlesioned carrying
DA-unloaded TiO2 lattice implants (n =
3), unlesioned carrying DA-loaded TiO2 lattice implants
(n = 3), 6-OHDA lesioned carrying DA-unloaded TiO2 lattice implants (n = 8), and 6-OHDA lesioned
carrying DA-loaded TiO2 lattice implant (n = 8) rats. In all cases, neurons counted always had clearly defined
somatic boundaries and near-central nuclei. SNpc located in both sides
of the mesencephalon were compared within and across groups.

2.4.4 In Vivo DA Release and Quantification
To assess whether
TiO2 lattices indeed released DA into
the denervated CN, we obtained tissue samples of this brain region
from rats implanted or not with DA-unloaded (n =
4) or -loaded (n = 8) TiO2 lattices. Animals
carried the implants during either 15 or 30 days. Rats were sacrificed
by overdosing them with pentobarbital, and the tissue samples were
rapidly obtained following decapitation. After removing the brains
from the skull, each brain was hemisected longitudinally, and the
CN was dissected, collected in centrifuge tubes, and sonicated in
200 μL of acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich). The homogenates were
then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm during 5 min at room temperature.
After centrifugation, the organic phase was evaporated and the pellet
resuspended in 100 μL of 0.1 M perchloric acid supplemented
with 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Each sample was then
stored at −70 °C until use. Protein quantification was
done using the bicinchoninic acid protein quantification assay kit
(cat 23225; Pierce). On the day of the experiment, 10 μL samples
were injected into the chromatographic column (Phenomenex Hyper Clone
ODS, 5 μm internal diameter and 120 Å pore, 4.6 mm ×
150 mm; No. 00F-4361-EO). The separation was achieved using an aqueous
mobile phase of 0.05 M ammonium acetate (supplemented with 0.66 M
glacial acetic acid to adjust the pH to a value of 3.5) and an organic
mobile, acetonitrile phase. The flow rate of the mobile phase was
1.0 mL/min at room temperature, and the separation was conducted following
a gradient-based protocol. DA was detected using a variable wave ultraviolet
(UV) light detector at λ = 270 nm; DA’s retention time
is 3.36 min (±0.15 min). The data were captured by a Waters e-SAT/IN
interface, processed using Empower 3 software and reported as ng/mg
of protein.

2.4.5 In Vitro DA Release and
Quantification
To assay DA release from TiO2 lattices
in vitro, a series
of DA-loaded TiO2 lattices (5 μL) were incubated
in 500 μL Eppendorf tubes, each filled with 250 μL of
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, 119 mM NaCl, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, and pH 7.4). The tubes were kept at 37 °C
under gentle shaking. Individual tubes were removed from the incubator,
one by one, at different times along 1 month. The concentration of
DA was estimated by HPLC, as described previously.

2.4.6 Lipid Peroxidation
DA, DAq, DAcr,
and TiO227 may induce oxidative
stress. We then tested whether TiO2 matrices alone or loaded
with DA increase polyunsaturated lipid peroxidation by using an assay
(TBARS Assay Kit, Cat. No. KA1381AB, Abnova) designed to detect malondialdehyde
(MDA), an end product of the lipid oxidative reaction chain. In this
assay, lipid peroxidation is estimated by colorimetric (532 nm) measures
following the formation of a pink product that results from the condensation
of MDA and thiobarbituric acid (TBA), after a nucleophilic attack
involving TBA’s carbon-5 and MDA’s carbon-1 of MDA.
The concentration of MDA–TBA product is proportional to the
MDA present. Hence, the intensity of the pink MDA–TBA product
available in the solution indicates the extent of lipid peroxidation.

Male Wistar rats (250 g) were used to estimate lipid peroxidation
in tissue samples obtained from animals stereotaxically implanted
in the CN (AP = 0, ML = +3.2, DV = −4) with 5 μL of TiO2 matrices unloaded (n = 5) or DA-loaded (n = 5). After 2 months, rats of both groups were euthanized
with pentobarbital and decapitated as previously described. Then,
their brains were obtained and hemisected. The exposed CNs were dissected
and processed precisely as recommended by the kit’s supplier.
In brief, 25 mg of CN was homogenized through sonication in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer (250 μL, supplemented with the complete protease
inhibitor cocktail (Cat. No. 4693124001, Roche) at 4 °C). The
samples were centrifuged (1600 g) for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants
were collected and used for estimating MDA concentration reported
as μM/25 mg of the tissue.

2.4.7 Statistics
Behavioral, morphological,
and biochemical results are all presented as mean values ± standard
error and compared between groups by using one-way ANOVA tests followed
by post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparison tests; all data passed
normality tests. In all cases, the p-value was considered
significant if reached <0.01. Graphs were generated, and the statistical
analyses conducted, using Prism software 6.0 (GraphPad, Inc.).

3 Results
3.1 Physicochemical Analyses
of DA-Unloaded or
-Loaded TiO2 Lattices
3.1.1 DA
Binds to the TiO2 Lattice
FTIR spectra of DA,
of the TiO2 matrix, and of the TiO2/DA complex
were obtained to establish the chemical interaction
taking place between TiO2 and DA. Results are shown in Figure 1. The analyses of
DA (Figure 1A) revealed
peaks between 2959 and 3373 cm–1 associated with
hydrogen bonds, at 1620 cm–1 related with N–H
bond bending and at 1585 cm–1 associated with the
C=C bond vibration modes within the aromatic ring, at 1319
and 1338 cm–1 produced by the C–N bond stretching
modes, at 1284 cm–1 produced by C–H2 bonds vibrational mode, at 1190 cm–1 arising from
the C–O bonds stretching vibration, and at 940 cm–1 corresponding to C–C–N bonds bending vibration. FTIR
analyses of the TiO2 matrix (Figure 1B) showed the presence of Ti–O–C
bonds resulting from the partial interaction between TiO2 with some carbons of the highly organized structure of 15C5. We
also observed peaks at about 439 and 474 cm–1 that
corresponded to the Ti–O–Ti stretching vibration bonds
of rutile and anatase crystalline phases, respectively. As we expected,
the presence of the organic template 15C5 during the synthesis of
the TiO2 matrix generated its partial crystallization favoring
the formation, at room temperature, of some anatase and rutile zones.
Ti–O bonds vibration mode was represented by a peak at 551
cm–1; documenting the presence of Ti–O bonds
is important since they decrease the metal ion biological toxicity.36 Spectra inflections at 761 and 839 cm–1 represent C–H bending vibration bonds from the 15C5 crown
ether, whereas those observed at 1014 and 1080 cm–1 arise from the νC–O vibrations. Ti–O–C
bonds are represented by the peak arising at 1160 cm–1; this peak results from the partial interaction between TiO2 with some carbons of 15C5 structure. Probably this interaction
between TiO2 molecules with the highly ordinated structure
of 15C5 gives rise to the semicrystallinity of the TiO2 once incorporated into the matrix.

Figure 1 Representative FTIR spectra of (A) DA,
(B) TiO2 matrix,
and (C) TiO2/DA complex. The vibrational modes corresponding
to DA and TiO2 are identified with black dashed lines and
black solid lines, respectively.

Finally, FTIR spectra of the TiO2/DA complex (Figure 1C) revealed remarkable
differences when compared with the spectra obtained from the unloaded
matrix. Most notably, the 15C5 structure-associated peaks are absent
in the former. Also, in TiO2/DA complex spectra, two new
peaks at 1067 and 1093 cm–1 appeared. These likely
arise from the presence of C–O–C bonds, which is itself
evidence suggesting that C–O groups from the 15C5 structure
are interacting not only with TiO2 matrix but also with
the CH groups of DA. In support of this notion, we also observed peaks
at 2430 and 2864 cm–1 ascribed to hydrogen bonds.
Furthermore, TiO2/DA complex spectra show the presence
of two new peaks at 509 and 568 cm–1 that presumably
represent the bonding between Ti and DA hydroxyl groups.37−39Table 1 depicts the
whole set of FTIR spectral peaks obtained for DA and DA-unloaded and
-loaded TiO2 matrices.

3.1.2 TiO2 Lattice
Prevents DA Oxidation
The vibrational modes corresponding
to the oxidation products DA-quinone
(DAq) and DA-chrome (DAcr) were identified by means of oxidized dopamine
FTIR spectrum and are shown in Figure 2A. DA oxidation process into the TiO2 matrix
was evaluated by FTIR (Figure 2B). At room temperature, DAq traces were detected at time
zero, as documented by the presence of low-amplitude peaks occurring
at 1375 and 1510 cm–1. These inflections correspond
to DAq’s C=O and C=C stretching bond modes.40 Thus, DA was lightly oxidized by the time it
was introduced into the matrix. After 456 h, two low-amplitude peaks
appeared at 1290 and 1456 cm–1. These peaks corresponded
to DAq’s C–O bonds and DAcr’s C=C stretching
vibration bonds,40 thus indicating that
a small fraction of DA became oxidized.

of DA into TiO2 matrix was recorded as a function of time.
The vibrational modes corresponding to DA-quinone (DAq) and DA-chrome
(DAcr) are identified with black dotted lines.

Finally, a low-amplitude peak ascribed to DAq’s C=O
stretching vibration bond modes was detected at 1652 cm–1.31 Interestingly, at all times recorded,
the amplitude of all peaks remains similar, thus indicating that DA
oxidation proceeds at a constant rate. Such a rate is temperature-sensitive
since it is greatly reduced by keeping DA-loaded matrix at 4°C
(Supporting Information, Figure S2); thus,
the matrix can be stored for several months after preparation and
before implantation.

3.1.3 TiO2 Lattice
Crystallinity Is
Preserved After DA Bonding
DA-unloaded or -loaded TiO2 matrices predominantly displayed an amorphous phase, as supported
by the presence of an undefined broad band at 2θ = 22.5°
under X-ray diffraction pattern analyses, as shown in Figure 3. However, crystallization
is partially present (semicrystalline structure) in both DA-unloaded
or -loaded TiO2 matrices with nanometric zones, as observed
by HTEM in Figure 4A,D. At these zones, the nanocrystal is practically spherical because
diameters Dmax and Dmin are almost equal (Figure 4G). In both cases, nanocrystals presented either rutile
phase (an interplanar distance of 0.205–0.207 nm, which corresponds
to the (210) reflection) (Figure 4B,E) or anatase phase (an interplanar distance of 0.184
nm, which correspond to the (200) reflection) (Figure 4C,F), as predicted by FTIR. The semicrystalline
structures of DA-unloaded and -loaded TiO2 matrices were
comparable. Hence, DA does not affect the semicrystalline morphology
of TiO2 matrices, an observation that implies that DA binds
to the surface of the TiO2. It has been reported that the
interaction between DA and crystalline TiO2 may be established
by bidentate modes (the molecule bonded to two Ti sites via its two
oxygen sites), a chelated mode (i.e., the molecule bonded to one Ti
site via its two oxygen sites), and a monodentate mode (i.e., the
molecule bonded to one Ti site via one oxygen site). However, since
the bidentate mode is the most favorable energetically,41,42 it is possible that the enediol ligands, interacting with the two
OH groups of DA, bind DA to the surface of TiO2 matrix,
resulting in a single surface-modified TiO2.

Decreased CN TH-Positive
Fiber Immunostaining and SNpc TH-Positive Neuron Number While Inducing
Motor Deficits
TH immunohistochemistry was used to corroborate
the efficiency of the CN dopaminergic denervation in lesioned rats.
As shown in Figure 5, control rats displayed intense CN and SNpc TH immunoreactivity
(Figure 5A), whereas
the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats had a noticeable reduction of this labeling
in both the CN and SNpC ipsilateral to the lesioned side (Figure 5B) but not in the
opposite side (not shown). In agreement with this result, 6-OHDA-lesioned
rats showed 10 times more contralateral turns after amphetamine treatment
(Figure 5C; see also
Supporting Information Video S1) and displayed
a marked reduction of the number of SNpc TH-positive neurons ipsilateral
to the lesioned side, regardless of whether they carried DA-unloaded
or -loaded TiO2 lattices (Supporting Information, Figure S3). Unlesioned rats implanted with DA-unloaded
or -loaded TiO2 lattices did not show altered numbers of
TH-positive neurons, thus supporting that implants loaded or not with
DA have no neurologic toxic effects for up to 2 months (Supporting
Information, Figure S3). In addition, rats
implanted with DA-unloaded or -loaded TiO2 lattices revealed
CN TH immunostaining equivalent to that seen in nonimplanted, 6-OHDA-lesioned
rats (Figure 5D), thus
indicating that neither lattice implantation nor DA released from
it promotes the regeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway.
It was also observed that implants remained relatively intact in place
at least after 2 months (Figure 5D), thus suggesting that systemic toxicity may be limited.

among groups were observed.

3.2.2 TiO2 Lattices Readily Release
DA in Vivo and in Vitro
To evaluate whether TiO2 lattices release DA into the CN and under in vitro conditions, we
measure DA content in CN homogenates and in liquid samples of tubes
filled with ACSF (Figure 5F), respectively, through HPLC. DA content in the CN samples
of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats implanted with DA-loaded TiO2 lattices,
but not in those implanted with DA-unloaded lattices, increased steadily
for up to 2 months following implantation (Figure 5E). In vitro, DA concentration rapidly increased
during the first 15 days and then dropped by day 30 of incubation
(Figure 5F). Clearly,
TiO2 lattices are capable of releasing DA when tested under
in vivo and in vitro conditions. Differences of the rate of DA release
between conditions likely reflect the technical variations inherent
to in vivo and in vitro testing.

3.2.3 TiO2 Lattices Unloaded or Loaded
with DA Did Not Increase CN Lipid Peroxidation
Lipid peroxidation
is an index used to estimate oxidative damage. DA, its metabolites,
and TiO2 may induce oxidative stress. We then estimated
the concentration of MDA to evaluate whether DA-loaded or -unloaded
TiO2 lattices induce oxidative stress following implantation.
Our results show that MDA concentration (Figure 5G) was similar in the CN of nonlesioned or
6-OHDA-lesioned, implanted rats regardless of whether the TiO2 lattices carried DA or not, at least after a month following
implantation, telling us that the implant does not produce oxidative
stress.

3.2.4 CN Implantation of DA-Loaded TiO2 Lattices Attenuates Motor Symptoms in 6-OHDA-Lesioned Rats
We tested the therapeutic effects of implanting DA-loaded TiO2 lattices into the CN of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Rats lesioned
unilaterally with 6-OHDA in the nigrostriatal pathway, but implanted
with DA-loaded TiO2 lattices, showed a significant reduction
of the number of amphetamine-induced turns, as compared with 6-OHDA-lesioned
rats carrying no implants (Figure 6; compare 6-OHDA and 6-OHDA/TiO2DA columns;
also see Supporting Information, Video S2). The effect seems cumulative over time because rats implanted with
DA-loaded TiO2 lattices displayed normalized amphetamine-induced
turning behavior by the end of the 2nd month of sustained treatment
(Figure 6; compare
6-OHDA/TiO2DA columns at 1 and 2 months following implantation).
The beneficial effect of implanting DA-loaded TiO2 lattices
seems specific since the implantation of DA-unloaded ones did not
attenuate amphetamine-induced, abnormal turning behavior in 6-OHDA-lesioned
rats (Figure 6; compare
6-OHDA/TiO2 columns versus 6-OHDA/TiO2DA column
at 1 and 2 months following implantation). Lastly, we introduced two
groups of control rats that carried one DA-unloaded (Figure 6; TiO2 columns)
and the other DA-loaded (Figure 6; TiO2/DA columns) TiO2 lattices
to evaluate implant toxicity. As shown in Figure 6, rats carrying implants loaded or not with
DA showed no abnormal turning behavior following 1 or 2 months after
implantation. These results suggest that neither neurological nor
systemic toxicity is induced by the implant regardless of whether
or not they carry DA, at least during the period evaluated.

4 Discussion and Conclusions
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative
disorder characterized, at intermediate stages, by the expression
of motor symptoms associated with the decrease of CN DA availability.
The restitution of CN DA concentration must then be at the core of
the therapeutic measures aimed at correcting PD-associated motor deficits.
Many have been the strategies developed over the years that procure
this goal. Unfortunately, most, if not all, have failed in providing
a long-term, reliable source of DA to the depleted CN. We think that
nanotechnological developments could improve our chances of accomplishing
such a goal. Accordingly, in this work, we describe the assembly of
a TiO2 semicrystalline lattice that readily releases DA
when implanted into 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. The DA released by the implanted
TiO2 lattice attenuated motor symptoms to various degrees
in this group of rats in a specific way since implanted DA-unloaded
TiO2 lattices did not attenuate the motor dysfunction.
In addition, we did not observe systemic or local toxicity associated
with the implantation of DA-loaded or -unloaded TiO2 lattices
during the periods evaluated. Hence, the use of implantable devices
designed to permit the frequent replacing of DA-loaded TiO2 lattices might prove to be an effective, long-term source of DA
for PD patients in the future. Even though such a device is not available
yet, we are currently working on the prototype.

DA, when released
free and exposed to the extracellular space,
is rapidly oxidized into the toxic metabolites DAq and DAcr that may
lead to oxidative stress. It is imperative, therefore, to evade as
much as possible DA oxidation when administering it into the brain
from external, non-neural sources. Accordingly, in this work, we showed
that TiO2 semicrystalline lattices reduce DA oxidation.
Indeed, the formation of DAq and DAcr was significantly decreased
when DA was contained into the TiO2 lattice. Even though
some oxidation may occur, its rate was low and remained constant for
months under in vitro conditions at room temperature. Although the
molecular interactions underlying the ability of TiO2 lattices
to protect DA from being oxidized are yet unclear, we think that the
charge-transfer complex formed between the DA and TiO2 crystalline
phases prevents DA from the ongoing oxidation; the structural stability
of TiO2–DA linkages depends on the bidentate binding,
as previously suggested.24 Furthermore,
we believe that the crown ether is situated, electrostatically, around
some of DA’s H atoms, also preventing DA to be oxidized. It
has been shown that 15C5 enhances the fluorescence emission of Eu2+ because the coordinating macrocyclic ligand protects these
ions of interactions with OH groups from water, which induce its nonradiative
decay.43 In a similar way, we also consider
that the 15C5 protects DA from interactions with external O2 ions, avoiding its oxidation.

DA must be readily available
in the extracellular space to exert
its modulatory actions. Its excess, nonetheless, might lead to toxic
effects. In our in vivo experiments, TiO2 lattices implanted
into the CN readily release, for up to a month, DA in amounts sufficient
to attenuate the motor symptoms displayed by 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.
During this time, however, DA concentration was several fold higher
in homogenates of implanted CN than that in reference CNs. Given these
concentrations, DA could have been toxic locally. We then tested this
possibility by estimating lipoperoxidation in the CN of unlesioned
rats and of rats implanted with TiO2 lattices loaded or
not with DA. We did not find significant differences in CN lipoperoxidation
among groups, thus suggesting that neither DA nor TiO2 lattices
are toxic alone or conjoint under the experimental conditions assessed
for up to 1 month. We complemented these results by evaluating turning
behavior and SNpc neuron number after implanting DA-unloaded or -loaded
TiO2 lattices into the CN of unlesioned rats. Both parameters
were found fully comparable to those observed in intact rats, also
suggesting that neither DA nor TiO2 lattices are toxic
alone or conjoint at the systemic level for up to 2 months. Our results,
nevertheless, cannot rule out DA and/or TiO2 lattice in
vivo toxicity if they are available for time periods longer than those
tested here. This is why, in the future, we advise that TiO2 lattice-containing devices must be capable of isolating lattices
from the host tissue and carefully dosing the amount of DA released
into the implanted CN. Also, since COX2 mediates DA conversion into
its oxidizing metabolites,44 the device
might be designed to corelease DA and an inhibitor of COX2. Also,
the dietary consumption of antioxidants and/or the oral administration
of COX2 inhibitors (e.g., meloxicam) could help prevent and/or attenuate
potential side effects associated with the use of DA-loaded TiO2 lattice devices to locally and chronically supply DA in PD
patients. Lastly, since DA released by the matrix likely diffuses
widely through the caudate nucleus (volume transmission for DA has
been estimated to be 14.7–9.3 nM),35 the final concentration at distinct points could be low enough to
avoid toxicity since DA-buffering mechanisms could take care of it.
Clearly, future experiments must assess the in vivo diffusion rate
and ratio of the DA freed by the implanted TiO2 lattices
by using radioactive DA. They may also establish the mechanism by
which DA is freed from the TiO2 lattice. We think, nonetheless,
that DA release from the TiO2 lattice might ensue following
the “rupture” of hydrogen bonds occurring predominantly
in the amorphous structure of the TiO2 lattice when placed
in aqueous media. In any event, it is fair to state that TiO2 lattices stand as a promising tool to release DA readily following
a concentration or electromotive gradient.

Finally, an intriguing
aspect of this work relates to the basic
aspects of brain function. The brain takes a great deal of time to
form rather specific connections among neuronal assemblies. This is
why we have a “connectivist” view of the brain morphofunctional
operation. The fact that DA is not released at specific synaptic sites
but rather freed widely in the extracellular space from the TiO2 lattices, and yet it remains capable of attenuating motor
dysfunctions in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, challenges the notion of a predominantly
connectivist brain. In this case, it appears that volume transmission
and the widespread activation of dopaminergic transmission with lack
of topographic specificity are sufficient to overcome the functional
morphological impairment associated with DA depletion of the CN in
hemiparkinsonian rats. It would then be necessary to explore the long-term
effects of volume transmission on the specificity of synaptic and
circuit operations to foresee potential negative effects.
