We herein investigated collision-induced
dissociation (CID) processes
of undecagold clusters protected by mixed ligands [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+ (X = Cl,
C≡CPh) using mass spectrometry and density functional theory
calculations. The results showed that the CID produced fragment ions
[Aux(PPh3)yXz]+ with a formal electron
count of eight via sequential loss of PPh3 ligands and
AuX(PPh3) units in a competitive manner, indicating that
the CID channels are governed by the electronic stability of the fragments.
Interestingly, the branching fraction of the loss of the AuX(PPh3) units was significantly smaller for X = C≡CPh than
that for X = Cl. We ascribed the effect of X on the branching fractions
of dissociations of PPh3 and AuX(PPh3) to the
steric difference.

1 Introduction
Atomically
precise metal clusters protected by organic ligands
(thiolates, phosphines, halides, and alkynes) have attracted the attention
of material scientists as building units of new functional materials,
owing to their unique physicochemical properties.1−4 To understand the origin of their
novel properties and to rationally design their functions, characterization
of their geometric and electronic structures is of paramount importance.
The atomic structures of the clusters that are crystallized have been
determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. By contrast, high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy5−7 and X-ray absorption spectroscopy8,9 have been successfully used for structural characterization of the
metal clusters that cannot be crystallized. The electronic structures
have been probed by optical spectroscopy,10,11 voltammetry,12−14 and laser photoelectron spectroscopy.15 These studies have demonstrated that the properties
of protected metal clusters are strongly dependent on the number and
arrangement of the constituent atoms of the metallic core.

Surface
modification is another key to tuning the electronic structures,
functionality, and stability of metal clusters. Anionic ligands such
as thiolates, halides, and alkynes play a role in adjusting the formal
number of valence electrons in the metallic core: they take one electron
from the metallic core.16 Chiral ligands
can impart chiroptical activity in the metal clusters.17−20 It was proposed that circular dichroic activity can be amplified
by placing the π-electron system near the metallic cores.21,22

Ligation of alkynes enhanced the catalytic activity23 and allowed electronic conjugation between the
metallic core and ligands.24 Geometric
structures of the ligands govern the coverage of the metallic core25 and the structures of the interface26 and the metallic core.27 Binding affinity of the ligands affects the thermal stability of
metal clusters against aggregation.28 It
was reported that [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ and Au11(PPh3)7Cl3 showed different reactivity in the ligand-exchange
reaction with thiols.29 Recently, collision-induced
dissociation (CID) mass spectrometry has proven to be a powerful tool
to characterize the bonding nature and stability of the ligand-protected
metal clusters in the isolated state in vacuum.30−38 Ligand-protected metal clusters that are internally excited upon
collision with rare gas atoms undergo unimolecular dissociation. Mass
analysis revealed the dissociation of RH, (RS)2, and Au4(SR)4 in the CID processes of thiolate-protected
Au clusters30−32 and dissociation of Ag3(SR)3 and Ag(SR) in the CID of thiolate-protected Ag clusters.33,34 Ligand loss, ligand activation, and core fission were observed in
the CID of phosphine-protected Au clusters.35−38

We herein conducted CID
mass spectrometry on one of the typical
protected gold clusters, [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+ [X = Cl, C≡CPh (phenyl acetylene,
PA)]. These gold clusters can be viewed as Au113+ superatoms having a closed electronic structure with eight electrons
protected by neutral (PPh3) and anionic (X–) ligands. The CID of [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+ provides molecular level information on
how the dissociation of the mixed ligands proceeds from the Au113+ superatom upon collisional excitation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+ Samples
Figure 1a shows
the positive-ion
electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra of [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+ (X = Cl, PA). The
single peaks in the mass spectra can be assigned to [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+ (X = Cl,
PA) by the isotope pattern analysis, indicating high purity of the
samples used in this study. Figure 1b shows the optical spectra of [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+ (X = Cl, PA). The
spectrum of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ agreed well with that reported previously.29 The spectral profile of the newly synthesized
[Au11(PPh3)8(PA)2]+ is similar to that of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+, suggesting similar structures. Figure 1c shows the optimized
structures of [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+ (X = Cl, PA) obtained by density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. The optimized structure of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ reproduced the crystal
structure reported previously;29 ten surface
Au atoms of the icosahedron-like Au11 core are completely
capped by eight PPh3 and two Cl ligands. The structure
of [Au11(PPh3)8(PA)2]+ newly synthesized in this study could not be determined crystallographically,
but the optimized structure was obtained by replacing Cl of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ with
PA while retaining the motifs of the Au11 core. These results
illustrate that the effect of anionic ligands on the geometric and
electronic structures is rather small.

(UV–vis) spectra, and (c) calculated structures of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ and

(Cl), and dark green (C). Phenyl groups of PPh3 and PA
ligands are depicted by black and green wireframes, respectively.
H atoms are omitted for simplicity.

2.2 Thermal-Induced Dissociation and CID of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+
Two fragments, [Au11(PPh3)7Cl2]+ and [Au10(PPh3)7Cl1]+, were observed in the thermal-induced
dissociation (TID) in the temperature range of 94–139 °C
(Figure 2). The formation
of [Au11(PPh3)7Cl2]+ involves loss of one PPh3 ligand. 1  

Figure 2 TID
mass spectra of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ measured at the capillary temperature
of (a) 94, (b) 115, and (c) 139 °C.

To confirm the energetical feasibility of eq 1 and to identify the most weakly
bound ligand,
we calculated the dissociation energy of the following reaction for
all possible ligands. Figure 3 shows the energy diagrams of the dissociation pathways of
PPh3. Isomeric structures of [Au11(PPh3)7Cl2]+ optimized are shown in Figure S1. The dissociation channels were categorized
into three in terms of energies depending on the positions of the
ligand lost (as categorized in the inset of Figure 3). It was found that the PPh3 ligand
bonded to the bottom site is the most weakly bonded. Although it is
not trivial to discuss whether this PPh3 is selectively
lost or not, it is safe to conclude that the loss of PPh3 is feasible under our TID conditions.

with the fragmentation of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ into [Au11(PPh3)7Cl2]+ (left)
and [Au10(PPh3)7Cl1]+ (right). Color codes in the inset: orange (Au), light green
(Cl), red, cyan, and yellow (P).

By contrast, there are two possible routes for the formation
of
[Au10(PPh3)7Cl1]+: loss of an AuCl(PPh3) unit (eq 2) or sequential loss of PPh3 followed
by AuCl (eq 3). 2   3  

To identify which
route is energetically plausible, the energies
for eqs 2 and 3 were calculated by DFT and are summarized in Figure 3. On the basis of
the calculation results for reaction 1, we limit
ourselves to consider the loss of PPh3 at the bottom. Optimized
structures of [Au10(PPh3)7Cl1]+ produced by eqs 2 and 3 and other fragments are
shown in Figure S2. The results show that
the loss of AuCl(PPh3) is energetically more favorable
than the sequential loss of PPh3 and AuCl. Namely, the
loss of Cl ligands is always accompanied by Au and PPh3 in the form of AuCl(PPh3), which corresponds to the synthetic
precursor of the clusters. In conclusion, the TID of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ proceeds
via the competitive loss of neutral fragments of PPh3 and
AuCl(PPh3).

The CID mass spectra of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ recorded
at various CID voltages are
listed in Figure 4.
Monocationic product ions assigned to [Aux(PPh3)yClz]+ (peaks 2–11)
are observed as a result of the CID of the precursor ions (peak 1), indicating that ligand fission was not involved. The (x, y, z) values for peaks 1–11 are listed in Table 1. The mass assignment was confirmed through
isotope pattern analysis. The important finding is that the formal
number of valence electrons is eight for all fragments observed. With
an increase in the CID voltage (i.e., nominal collision energy), the
values of (x, y, z) gradually decreased, as we expected.

According to the TID results,
CID of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ also proceeds via the competitive
loss of neutral fragments of PPh3 and AuCl(PPh3). Namely, the ionic fragments observed in Figure 4 can be viewed as the composites of the eight-electron
superatomic core of Au9+, neutral PPh3 ligands, and AuCl(PPh3) and can be formulated as Au9+(PPh3)n[AuCl(PPh3)]m. The (n, m) values for peaks 1–11 are listed in Table 1. CID proceeds according to eq 4 4  

The energetically
preferable dissociation pathways
of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ are considered
using the (n, m) representation.
The populations of fragments (n, m) (Figure 4) are plotted
as a function of the CID voltage in Figure S3. In this analysis, we ignore the fragments with populations smaller
than 3% at certain CID voltages. The populations of fragments with
smaller (n, m) values are increased
with the increase of the CID voltage, indicating that the release
of neutral species proceeds sequentially with the increase in the
collision energy. The fragments of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ are summarized in Scheme 1. To gain insight
into the major dissociation pathways, the maximum value of the population
of each fragment (see Figure S3) is represented
by the degree of contrast of the gray background: the dominant fragment
is indicated by greater contrast. Scheme 1 indicates that the fragmentation of neutral
fragments of PPh3 and AuCl(PPh3) from [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ proceeds
competitively.

Scheme 1 CID Pathway of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+
2.3 CID of [Au11(PPh3)8(PA)2]+
Figure 5 shows the CID mass spectra of [Au11(PPh3)8(PA)2]+ (peak 1) as a function of the CID voltage. All of fragment peaks 2–10 are assigned to [Aux(PPh3)y(PA)z]+, and the (x, y, z) values are listed in Table 2. The fragments correspond to
eight-electron superatoms and are formulated as Au9+(PPh3)n[Au(PA)(PPh3)]m, as in the case of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+.
The (n, m) values for peaks 1–10 are listed in Table 2. The populations of the fragments are plotted
as a function of the CID voltage in Figure S6, and the CID pathways are shown in Scheme 2. Obviously, the fragmentation pathway of
[Au11(PPh3)8(PA)2]+ was different from that of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+. In the case of [Au11(PPh3)8(PA)2]+, sequential loss of PPh3 ligands was much more favored
than that of the Au(PA)(PPh3) unit.

2.4 Effect
of X on CID of [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+
As demonstrated
in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, eight-electron superatoms Au9+(PPh3)n[AuX(PPh3)]m were obtained in the CID of
[Au11(PPh3)8X2]+ (=Au9+(PPh3)6[AuX(PPh3)]2) via competitive loss of PPh3 and
AuX(PPh3). Notably, we observed that the anionic ligand
X significantly affects the branching fractions of the two dissociation
channels, although it does not affect the electronic and geometric
structures of the Au113+ superatom. This section
focuses on the origin of the effect of ligand X on the branching fractions
of the CID processes of [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+. We first compared the energetics related
to the dissociation of PPh3 and AuX(PPh3) from
[Au11(PPh3)8X2]+. According to the calculation results in Figure S7, the minimal dissociation energies of PPh3 (−0.14
eV) and Au(PA)(PPh3) (−0.02 eV) from [Au11(PPh3)8(PA)2]+ are comparable
to those of PPh3 (−0.08 eV) and AuCl(PPh3) (0.19 eV) from [Au11(PPh3)8(PA)2]+ (Figure 3). Thus, the difference in the branching fractions of the
CID pathways is not due to the difference in energetics between X
= Cl and PA.

The major difference between the fragmentation
of PPh3 and AuX(PPh3) is that the former proceeds
via breaking of the Au–P bond, whereas the latter requires
significant rearrangement of the chemical bonds. In order that AuX(PPh3) is dissociated from collisionally excited [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+, the two
ligands X and PPh3 originally bonded to different surface
Au atoms must be transferred to a single Au atom. As shown in the
space-filling model of [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+ (Figure 6), the local environment of X is sterically crowded.
Under such circumstances, the formation of AuX(PPh3) is
retarded when X becomes bulkier. Although information on the structure
of the transition state is not presently available, we propose that
the bulkiness of the PA ligand contributes to the suppression of the
dissociation of Au(PA)(PPh3), thereby preferentially promoting
the loss of PPh3.

Figure 6 Space-filling models of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ (left) and [Au11(PPh3)8(PA)2]+ (right). Cl and PA are
depicted in green.

3 Conclusions
We studied the CID processes of undecagold clusters, [Au11(PPh3)8X2]+, protected
by mixed ligands of PPh3 and X (=Cl, PA), using mass spectrometry
and DFT calculations. Eight-electron superatoms formally described
as Au9+(PPh3)n[AuCl(PPh3)]m were obtained
via competitive loss of PPh3 and AuX(PPh3).
This result indicates that the CID channels are governed by the electronic
stability of the product ions. Interestingly, we observed that the
anionic ligand X significantly affects the branching fractions of
the two competing dissociation channels, although it does not affect
the electronic and geometric structures of the Au113+ superatom. We ascribed the suppression of dissociation of
Au(PA)(PPh3) to the kinetic retardation of the formation
of Au(PA)(PPh3) because of the steric hindrance of PA.

4 Methods
4.1 Synthesis and Characterization
Details
of the synthesis are provided in the Supporting Information. [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ was synthesized by a method reported previously
with slight modifications.29 [Au11(PPh3)8(PA)2]+ was newly
synthesized by the ligand exchange of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ with PA under conditions
similar to those for the synthesis of [Au13(diphosphine)5(PA)2]3+.24 The product was characterized by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
and ESI mass spectrometry.

4.2 Thermal-Induced Dissociation
Dissociation
reaction of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ was observed in a heated capillary of a home-built
ESI mass spectrometer. Details of the apparatus are available elsewhere.15 Briefly, the Au11 clusters dispersed
in acetonitrile (∼1 mg/mL) were electrosprayed at a flow rate
of 90 μL/h. Dissociation was induced by introducing them into
the capillary located at the entrance of the mass spectrometer and
resistively heated in the range of 93–139 °C. The cluster
ions injected into the capillary were thermalized by a sufficient
number of collisions with atmospheric molecules (>105)
before the dissociation. The fragments were monitored by a time-of-flight
(TOF) mass spectrometer.

4.3 Collision-Induced Dissociation
The
CID mass spectra were measured by using a JMS-T100LP (JEOL Ltd.) spectrometer
composed of an ESI source, an in-source CID assembly (Figure S8), and a TOF mass spectrometer. Acetonitrile
dispersion of the Au11 clusters (∼0.1 mg/mL) was
supplied to the ESI source at a flow rate of ∼2 mL/h. The pressure
of the region where CID occurred was ∼200 Pa. Voltage applied
to an electrode in the in-source CID assembly (CID voltage) was adjusted
within the range of 80–250 V (Figure S8). Under the above conditions, the collision energy of the ions with
a background gas (N2 in the nebulizer, the atmospheric
molecules, and the solvent) is expected to be higher than that in
the TID and increases with the CID voltage.

4.4 Theoretical
Calculations
The geometric
structures of [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ and [Au11(PPh3)8(PA)2]+ and possible candidates of the fragments
were studied by the DFT calculations on the B3LYP/LanL2DZ (Au) and
6-31G(d) (others) level. The spin multiplicities were fixed to a singlet.
Vibrational frequencies were calculated to confirm that the optimized
structures corresponded to local minimum structures. In the calculation
of the relative energies, the zero-point energies were taken into
account. The charge on each atom was estimated using natural population
analysis. All calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09
program.40 The results were visualized
through PyMOL.41
