Charged
molecular alloys and Zintl ions are of interest in synthetic
chemistry. However, their chemical bonding has seldom been elucidated
using modern quantum chemistry tools. Herein, we report on in-depth
chemical bonding analyses for a charged molecular alloy C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster
and its relevant Zintl ion C3v [P7]3– ligand, making use of
electronic structure calculations at PBE0/def2-TZVP level, natural
bond orbital and orbital composition analyses, canonical molecular
orbitals, and adaptive natural density partitioning (AdNDP). The computational
data show that C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion has three isolated,
negatively charged, bridging P sites. Such charges are largely P 3p
lone-pairs in nature, but they also participate in secondary P–P bonding
along the bridging sites. C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster is formulated
as [P7]2–[Zn]0[P7]2–, in which [P7]2– ligands maintain the structural and bonding integrity of [P7]3– Zintl ion despite their difference in
charge state. Two [P7]2– ligands collectively
bind with Zn center via four bridging P sites, resulting in a quasi-tetrahedral
ZnP4 core with the eight-electron counting. This bonding
picture can alternatively be rationalized using the superatom concept.
The Zn–P bonds are weak with a bond order of around 0.5, because
the P centers have partial nonbonding 3p character, akin to 3p2 lone-pairs albeit with a lower occupation number.

1 Introduction
During
the past decades, synthetic chemistry has witnessed fantastic
and fast-growing developments in Zintl ions, endohedral Zintl ions,
cage compounds, intermetalloid clusters, and charged molecular alloys.1−9 These compounds have unique molecular structures, intriguing (and
yet largely unknown) chemical bonding, and unusual chemical and physical
properties, with promising applications in materials science, catalysis,
and so forth. Among them, the so-called “charged molecular
alloys” are interesting, which use Zintl ions or relevant post-transition
metal or metalloid species as ligands to construct compounds with
a metallic core.4−6 These alloy clusters normally assume elongated dumbbell
or “polymeric” chain geometries, in which the Zintl
ion ligands maintain their chemical integrity. However, chemical bonding
in such compounds has seldom been elucidated in full detail, mainly
because the systems are quite large and complex so that analyses of
bonding via canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs) are challenging. Indeed,
this situation appears to be true even for naked Zintl ions.

Group 15 elements form stable homoatomic cage-like Zintl ions,
including heptapnictide trianions [E7]3– (E = P, As, Sb),10 which have rich chemistry
as reported in the earliest and most groundbreaking reactivity studies
on Zintl ions.5 The [E7]3– cages have nortricylane-like structures and are obtained
from dissolution of A3E7 alloys (A = alkali
metal; E = P, As, Sb) in polar nonprotic solvents (ethylenediamine
or liquid ammonia).1 A series of charged
molecular alloys, or binary intermetalloid clusters, were synthesized
with intact [E7]3– ligands. These compounds
can be sorted to two categories. In category one, transition-metal
atoms serve as links that connect [E7]3– anions. Here, the metal core is believed to be in the form
of an M2+ center or a Cu22+ and Au22+ dumbbell, such as in [(P7)Zn(P7)]4–, [(P7)Cd(P7)]4–, [(P7)Cu2(P7)]4–,11 and [(As7)Au2(As7)]4– compounds.12 Alternatively, the compounds may be viewed as
sandwich-type clusters. In the gas phase, sandwich hetero-decked clusters
were computed extensively by Yang and co-workers, which follow a versatile
scheme for assembly and stabilization.13−26 The other category is that the metal core fuses with [E7]3– ligands, leading to breakage of one E–E
bond in each [E7]3– ligand. Examples
are [(As7)Pd2(As7)]4– and [(Bi7)Ge4(Bi7)]4–.27,28 It should be noted that the exact nature
of bonding between metal centers and Zintl ion ligands in these compounds
remains to be understood, in light of limited knowledge in the literature.

In this contribution, we aim at understanding chemical bonding
of a synthetic charged molecular alloy cluster, C2 [P7ZnP7]4–,
using quantum chemical calculations. This cluster was crystallized
in the form of [K(2,2,2-crypt)]4[ZnP14]·6py
(py = pyridine) in 2010 by Goicoechea and co-workers,11 which consists of a bridging Zn center and two cage-like
[P7] ligands, assuming an overall dumbbell shape. The cluster
is presumably formulated as [P7]3–[Zn]2+[P7]3–. However, there has been
no computational study on this system so far, to our knowledge. Our
geometric optimizations and electronic structure calculations were
carried out using density functional theory (DFT)29 at the PBE0 level.30 To further
ensure computational reliability for a multiply charged anion, conductor-like
polarizable continuum mode (C-PCM) calculations31−34 were performed to take into account
solvation effects. Chemical bonding was elucidated using an array
of technical tools, including in particular the CMO (that is, Kohn-Sham
orbital) analysis and adaptive natural density partitioning (AdNDP).35 AdNDP turns out to be a powerful method to reach
an elegant bonding picture for C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster, as well as related
naked C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion. The bonding picture of the latter
is refined with respect to existing knowledge.

It is shown herein
that C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster features an eight-electron
quasi-tetrahedral ZnP4 core, which holds together the Zn
center and two P7 cage ligands with a formula of [P7]2–[Zn]0[P7]2–. The two cage-like ligands inherit the structure and bonding of C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion despite the difference in charge state. Overall, the eight-electron
bonding picture of C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster renders it a “superatom”,36−38 which underlies its stability as a synthetic charged molecular alloy.11 Furthermore, the Zn–P bonding is far
weaker than anticipated for an eight-electron tetrahedral system,
with a calculated bond order of around 0.5. This observation is ascribed
to the polar nature of the ZnP4 core, in which P centers
collectively contribute six electrons for Zn–P bonds with Zn
contributing the remaining two. In such a case, the P centers maintain
partial nonbonding 3p character and only a portion of around two electrons
(out of six) from four P centers actually participate in the Zn–P
bonds. This bonding situation is intriguing.

2 Results
2.1 Cluster Structure of [P7ZnP7]4–
We initially obtained the coordinates
of [P7ZnP7]4– cluster from
crystal data reported in the Goicoechea paper (Figure S1, Supporting Information).11 Full reoptimizations of the cluster were subsequently carried out
at the PBE0/def2-TZVP30,39 level. The ultimate optimized
structure has C2 (1A) symmetry,
as illustrated in Figure 1. All calculated structural parameters of [P7ZnP7]4– cluster are in line with experimental
data. For example, Zn–P bond distances are calculated to be
2.50 and 2.48 Å, which are virtually identical to crystal data
of 2.50 versus 2.47 Å, thus validating the computational method.

Figure 1 Optimized
structure of C2 (1A) [P7ZnP7]4– cluster using
the C-PCM calculations at PBE0/def2-TZVP level. Selected bond distances
(in Å; black color in boldface) are compared with experimental
crystal data from ref 11 (black color, in parentheses). Also presented are WBIs
(red color) and natural atomic charges (in |e|; blue color) via NBO
analysis.

The C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster can be
viewed as two [P7] cages interconnected via a Zn bridge,
which features an overall
dumbbell shape. At the core of the cluster is a ZnP4 structural
block. Approximately, the Zn center coordinates to four P atoms in
a tetrahedral fashion: two P atoms from each [P7] cage.
Herein, cage-like [P7] ligands possess similar structural
parameters with respect to naked [P7]3– Zintl ion,10 although the ligands in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– do not appear to be exactly in the charge state of [P7]3– (vide infra).

Optimized C3v (1A1) structure
of [P7]3– Zintl ion at PBE0/def2-TZVP
level is shown in Figure 2. The P sites are sorted into three subgroups
according to their coordination environments. P(i) represents one
apical P atom at top of the cage. Three P(ii) sites are located on
the waist of the cage, whereas three P(iii) sites form the base triangle.
Specifically, P(i) coordinates to three P(ii) atoms in a triangular
pyramid; P(ii) sites are dicoordinated, each bridging P(i) and one
P(iii) site; and P(iii) sites are tricoordinated. Overall, the [P7]3– Zintl cage has three exactly equivalent,
distorted P(i)P(ii)2P(iii)2 pentagons and one
equilateral P(iii)3 triangle. In dumbbell C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster
(Figure 1), the [P7] cages maintain their characteristic pentagonal and triangular
surfaces, for which the P10P12P14 and P11P13P15 triangles are the
bases, respectively.

Figure 2 Structure of C3v (1A1) [P7]3– Zintl ion
at PBE0/def2-TZVP level. Seven P atoms are sorted into three types:
P(i) for one apex atom at the top, P(ii) for three bridging P atoms
on the waist, and P(iii) for the basal three-membered ring. Bond distances
(in Å; black color) and natural charges (in |e|; blue color)
are shown.

The P–P distances in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– and C3v [P7]3– are 2.14–2.26 and 2.14–2.29 Å,
respectively (Figure
S2, Supporting Information). These numbers
are relatively uniform. According to the recommended covalent radii
by Pyykkö,40 typical single P–P
and double P=P bonds are around 2.22 and 2.04 Å, respectively.
Therefore, all P–P links in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster and C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion are roughly single bonds, making their bonding pictures
rather simple. In contrast, the Zn–P links in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster
have calculated distances of 2.48 and 2.50 Å (Figure 1), which are to be compared
with the Zn–P single bond of 2.29 Å,40,41 suggesting that the Zn–P links in [P7ZnP7]4– are far weaker than single bond. Note that
the present Zn–P distances are also longer than the mean Zn–P
distance (2.41 Å) from the Cambridge Structural Database.42

2.2 Wiberg Bond Indices and
Natural Atomic Charges
The above bond assignments for C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster and C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion are confirmed by Wiberg bond
indices (WBIs) from the natural
bond orbital (NBO) analysis, which gives bond orders of 0.85–1.16
and 0.80–1.20, respectively, for the P–P links. These
WBIs are close to single bonds, with the P(ii)–P(iii) bonds
in [P7]3– Zintl ion being moderately
beyond single bonds (WBIs: 1.20). For Zn–P links in C2 [P7ZnP7]4–, the calculated WBIs are 0.48/0.49 (Figure 1), which are indeed markedly smaller than
one.

As for the natural charges, bridging P(ii) sites in C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion carry the majority of negative charges (−0.64 |e|
per atom). The P(i) site has the least of charges (−0.19 |e|),
and the P(iii) sites each have −0.30 |e|. As a zero-order picture,
one can state that the charges in [P7]3– Zintl ion are located on three bridging sites (64% in total).
In other words, the Zintl ion has three P– bridging
sites and hence three sites with 3p2 lone-pair characters.
These largely localized charges are maintained in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster,
in which similar P centers each carry a charge of −0.51 to
−0.58 |e| (Figure 1). In contrast, apical P site in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– has a charge
of −0.11 |e| and the base P sites each carry −0.17/–0.18
|e|. Note that the Zn center is only moderately charged (+0.49 |e|; Figure 1).

3 Discussion
3.1 On the Nature of Bonding in C3v [P7]3– Zintl Ion
The [P7]3– Zintl
ion is an important ligand in synthetic chemistry,5,10 which
has gained accumulating knowledge in the literature. However, a detailed
bonding analysis based on CMOs is nonexistent for the species. Given
the importance of this ligand and the fact that relevant charged molecular
alloys are well-defined molecular systems, we believe it is valuable
to perform a thorough bonding analysis for C3v [P7]3– Zintl
ion (Figure 2).

The C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion is a 38-electron system with seven
P centers and nine P–P links, whose occupied CMOs are depicted
in Figure 3. Element
P has an electronic configuration of 3s23p3,
for which 3s2 electrons normally form lone-pairs. The set
of CMOs derived from P 3s atomic orbitals (AOs) are shown in Figure 3a. These seven CMOs
represent constructive/destructive combinations between top (triangular
pyramid) P4 and bottom (triangular) P3 segments.
Specifically, HOMO–12/HOMO–11, HOMO–10′/HOMO–8,
and HOMO–10/HOMO–8′ are constructive/destructive
pairs, which follow the building principles of CMOs43 and collectively recover three bonds for the top P4, as well as three for bottom P3. In addition,
HOMO–9 is attributed to top P4 fragment, being completely
antibonding between top P atom and three bridging P sites. The resultant
three bonds for bottom P3 fragment are in a combination
of bonding and nonbonding/antibonding, which further recombine as
three P 3s2 lone-pairs. Similarly, the four bonds in top
P4 fragment can be localized as four P 3s2 lone-pairs,
although the analysis is slightly more complex. Among these four bonds
for the P4 fragment, the bottom one is completely bonding
between all four P centers, the middle pair are nonbonding/antibonding
between three bridging P sites, while the top one (that is, HOMO–9; Figure 3) is antibonding
between the apical P atom and three bridging P atoms. The bottom and
top bonds can recombine first, which recover a P 3s2 lone-pair
for the apical atom, as well as a bond (formal and completely bonding)
for three bridging P atoms. The latter bond then recombines with the
middle pair to generate three P 3s2 lone-pairs for the
bridging sites.

PBE0/def2-TZVP
level. (a) P 3s2 lone-pairs. (b) CMOs that are approximated
to three bridging P 3p2 lone-pairs; see Table 1 and the text for further details.
(c) Two-center two-electron (2c-2e) Lewis P–P σ single
bonds.

A set of nine CMOs composed of
P 3p AOs are shown in Figure 3c. Among these, HOMO–7
and HOMO–3/HOMO–3′ are constructive combination
between top P4 and bottom P3 fragments, whereas
HOMO–5 and HOMO–4/HOMO–4′ are their destructive
counterparts. They collectively recover three bonds for top P4 and three for bottom P3, each in a typical bonding/nonbonding/antibonding
combination, which further recombine as two-center two-electron (2c-2e)
P–P σ bonds (six in total). The remaining CMOs, HOMO–2/HOMO–6/HOMO–6′,
are responsible for three P–P σ bonds on the waist, which
connect the P4 and P3 fragments. The above Lewis
elements (lone-pairs and 2c-2e σ bonds) use 32 electrons.

The three CMOs in Figure 3b appear to be tricky, which are mainly composed of 3p AOs
from three P(ii) centers by 72–79% (Table 1), oriented tangentially to the P(ii)P(ii)P(ii) triangle.
These CMOs also represent a bonding/nonbonding/antibonding combination,
readily localized as three P 3p2 lone-pairs (to a zeroth
order approximation), each on one bridge. Such a picture is routinely
discussed in synthetic literature,5,10 which can
be elegantly borne out from AdNDP analysis (Figure 4). Occupation numbers (ONs) are a quantitative
indicator on how an AdNDP bond is close to the bonding essence in
a molecular system. All ONs for 3s2 lone-pairs and 2c-2e
σ bonds are nearly perfect (1.91–1.95 and 1.96–1.99
|e|, respectively), whereas those for three 3p2 lone-pairs
on bridging P(ii) sites are 1.70 |e|. The latter ON values are less
than ideal, suggesting that this treatment is approximate. Although
we have clearly presented above that three 3p2 lone-pairs
on the P(ii) sites are only a zeroth order approximation (see also Table 1), one reviewer still
questions their lower ON values (Figure 4b). To fully accommodate the reviewer, we
offer here an alternative, refined AdNDP scheme for them (Figure 5), wherein the three
3p2 lone-pairs are refined as three P(ii)–P(iii)
π “bonds” with slightly enhanced ONs of 1.82 |e|.
It should be stressed that the two schemes do not differ fundamentally,
because even for the three P(ii)–P(iii) π “bonds”,
the relative contributions of P(ii) versus P(iii) are greater than
9 to 1. In other words, the effective π bond order is negligible
(less than 0.2) despite being called a π “bond”.

3p2 lone-pairs are expanded to three P(ii)–P(iii)
π bonds (from a local point-of-view), with enhanced ON values
from 1.70 to 1.82 |e|. Note that this scheme is intrinsically the
same as that in Figure 4b (see text).

a CMOs as depicted in Figure 3b. The three CMOs are routinely
viewed as P 3p lone-pairs on bridging P(ii) sites, which are only
an approximation.

b The P
sites are labeled in Figure 2.

Indeed, the corresponding
CMOs contain secondary (but nonnegligible)
components from P(iii) sites, by 20–24% (Figure 3b and Table 1), which contribute to extra P(ii)–P(iii) bridging
bonding. As a consequence, P(ii)–P(iii) distances are slightly
shorter than the P(i)–P(ii) or P(iii)–P(iii) ones: 2.14
versus 2.21/2.29 Å (Figure 2). The same trend is true for their WBIs: 1.20 versus
1.00/0.80. Therefore, we should conclude that the bridging P(ii) sites
in C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion each formally carry a negative charge
and yet a P 3p2 lone-pair herein is not completely pure,
which also partially participates in P(ii)–P(iii) bonding,
moderately boosting the bridging P(ii)–P(iii) links to beyond
single bonds (by a bond order of 0.2). This understanding updates
the existing bonding picture of C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion,5,10 which is relevant to its reactivities in synthetic chemistry. We
believe that the same is true for other relevant ligands, such as
[As7]3– and [Sb7]3–.

3.2 Charged Molecular Alloy C2 [P7ZnP7]4– Cluster:
An Eight-Electron “ZnP4” Core
Having
understood the structure and bonding of naked C3v [P7]3– Zintl
ion, those of C2 [P7ZnP7]4– as a charged molecular alloy cluster
become simpler. Note that with C-PCM calculations to account for solvation
effects, all occupied CMOs of C2 [P7ZnP7]4– are highly negative in
energy eigenvalues, of which the HOMO is completely binding by about
3.71 eV, indicating a robust electronic system despite multiple charges.
In addition, we have analyzed the wavefunction stability for [P7ZnP7]4–, and the result
indicates that the wavefunction is stable under the perturbations
considered. The C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster represents an alloy complex
between a Zn center and two cage-like P7 ligands. The latter
are not exactly [P7]3–; rather they appear
to be in the [P7]2– charge state.44 Nonetheless, because the frontier
CMOs of C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion are located on the P(ii) bridges
and primarily lone-pairs in nature (Figures 3 and 4), the skeleton
of P7 cage is robust and does not depend sensitively on
its charge state.

A couple of observations testify to the structural/chemical
integrity of P7 cages in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster. First,
the overall structural pattern of one apical P(i) site, three P(ii)
bridges, and a base P(iii)3 triangle is maintained. Specifically,
P2 and P3 are apical sites, whereas P10P12P14 and P11P13P15 are triangular
bases. Second, P–P distances in C3v [P7]3– are the shortest
for bridging P(ii) sites and longest for triangular P(iii)3 base: 2.21 Å for P(i)–P(ii), 2.14 Å for P(ii)–P(iii),
and 2.29 Å for P(iii)–P(iii). The corresponding P–P
distances in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– are 2.16–2.20, 2.14–2.17,
and 2.24–2.26 Å, respectively, which reflect the subtle
trend of C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion, except for slight distortions due
to lower symmetry of the charged molecular alloy cluster. Third, extra
charges in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster are also quite localized on the bridging
sites (−0.51 to −0.58 |e| per atom), as compared to
apical (−0.11 |e|) and base (−0.17 to −0.18 |e|
per atom) sites. Quantitatively, about 71% of negative charges on
a P7 cage ligand in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– are located on three
bridging sites, compared with 64% in naked C3v [P7]3– Zintl
ion. This observation further demonstrates that the bridging P sites
are electrophilic, although the resultant 3p lone-pairs are not necessarily
pure (Figure 4b and Table 1). In effect, each
P7 cage in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– collectively carries a charge
of −2.25 |e|, which deviates from C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion.

As an 86-electron system, CMOs of C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster are shown
in Figures S3 and S4 (Supporting Information), as well as Figure 6a. Briefly, each specific CMO of C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion forms
a pair of CMOs in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster via constructive/destructive
couplings, which can in turn recover two identical bonds, one on each
P7 ligand. Thus, all 32 CMOs in Figures S3b and S4 (Supporting Information) are P 3s2 lone-pairs
or 2c-2e P–P σ bonds, whereas two CMOs in Figure S3c
(Supporting Information) represent P 3p2 lone-pairs on P8 and P9 sites. Furthermore, the five CMOs
in Figure S3a (Supporting Information)
are primarily Zn 3d10 lone-pairs. These Lewis elements
consume 78 electrons.

Figure 6 Pictures of CMOs of (a) C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster that
are responsible
for Zn–P bonding in the ZnP4 core. Also shown for
comparison are those of (b) model D2d [ZnP4H8]2– cluster, (c) Td CH4, and
(d) Ne atom.

The key to chemical bonding
in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster lies in the ZnP4 core, which involves
only eight electrons. Their CMOs are
illustrated in Figure 6a, which consist of one completely bonding HOMO–23 between
all four Zn–P links and three bonding CMOs each connecting
two Zn–P links. The latter three CMOs are roughly equivalent
to each other, in the spirit of triple degeneracy in the Td system. The four CMOs can formally
be localized as four Zn–P σ bonds according to the building
principles, rendering a classical eight-electron system with quasi-tetrahedral
arrangement for C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster.

In summary, the P7 cages in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster appear
to be in formal charge state of [P7]2–, in which each ligand uses two P(ii) 3p based orbitals to interact
with Zn, forming an eight-electron bonding system. Here each ligand
offers three electrons via two bridging P sites, with the Zn center
balancing the remaining two electrons. The Zn center carries only
a positive charge of +0.49 |e| (Figure 1), which deviates markedly from the anticipated ionic
picture of [P7]3–[Zn]2+[P7]3–. Overall, the bonding between cage-like
P7 ligands and Zn center in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster is quite
“localized” in nature. In C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster, an isolated
Zn center interacts with two cage-like P7 ligands. Each
P7 ligand offers bonding via two isolated bridging P sites,
which have essentially nonbonding 3p electrons. These four P sites
in the ZnP4 core coordinate to Zn center in a quasi-tetrahedral
fashion with bond angles ∠PZnP of 82.8/122.4/124.9° because
of geometric constraints. For comparison, an ideal Td system has bond angles of 109.5°.
The AdNDP scheme (Figure 7) firmly confirms the above bonding picture for C2 [P7ZnP7]4–;
see below in Section 3.3 for further discussion on the essence of eight-electron ZnP4 bonding.

(c) Two P 3p2 lone-pairs on P8/P9 sites. (d) Eighteen 2c-2e

One reviewer suggests that we
further confirm the [P7]2– charge state
of cage ligands in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster
using additional computational tools. We stress that NBO analysis
is widely considered to be reliable for such a molecular system, and
therefore natural atomic charge of +0.49 |e| on Zn center indicates
that the cage ligands are roughly on [P7]2– charge state,44 rather than [P7]3–. We also reiterate that the [P7]2– or [P7]3– charge state
does not make a difference in terms of structure, stability, and bonding
of cage ligands (Figures 4 and 5; Table 1). To accommodate the reviewer, we have run
extended charge decomposition analysis (ECDA).45 We start with [P7]3–[Zn]2+[P7]3– in the ECDA calculation,
and the analysis shows that 1.48 |e| are donated from two cage ligands
to the Zn center. Thus, ECDA leads to a resultant configuration of
[P7]2.26–[Zn]+0.52[P7]2.26–, which is identical to the NBO data (see Figure 1) and closely in
line with our proposed bonding picture of [P7]2–[Zn]0[P7]2–.

3.3 Superatomic C2 [P7ZnP7]4– Cluster?
The quasi-tetrahedral,
eight-electron counting is a critical bonding
feature for C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster, which has been reached based on in-depth
bonding analyses. We believe that this magic electron counting underlies
the stability of C2 [P7ZnP7]4– as a synthetic charged molecular alloy
cluster.11 Superatoms or superatomic clusters
are a popular concept in cluster science,36−38 which may be
exploited to elucidate the structure and bonding of C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster.
To this end, we analyzed a model D2d [ZnP4H8]2– cluster
(Figure S5a, Supporting Information); the
latter is considered isoelectronic to C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster in terms
of bonding in the ZnP4 core. The D2d [ZnP4H8]2– cluster is a true minimum. Remarkably, it is virtually identical
to C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster in Zn–P distances, WBIs, and nature
charges (Figure S5 in Supporting Information versus Figure 1).
We can therefore use the simpler D2d [ZnP4H8]2– cluster
to mimic chemical bonding of C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster and to shed further
light on the bonding essence in the latter system.

CMO analysis
for D2d [ZnP4H8]2– cluster is relatively straightforward
(Figure S5, Supporting Information). This
is a 42-electron system. Five Zn 3d10 lone-pairs are clearly
identified, as are four P 3s2 lone-pairs and eight 2c-2e
P–H σ bonds, which use 34 electrons. The remaining eight
electrons are responsible for Zn–P bonding, whose CMOs (Figure 6b) show one-to-one
correspondence to those of C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster (Figure 6a), except that each CMO of [ZnP4H8]2– has uniform contributions from
all four Zn–P links due to its higher symmetry. Furthermore,
the bonding patterns are analogous to those in CH4 (Figure 6c) and even Ne atom
(Figure 6d), justifying
an argument that C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster can be considered a superatom,36−38 whose eight-electron quasi-tetrahedral ZnP4 core underlies
its electronic and structural stability.

We shall now make a
further comment on the nature of eight-electron
Zn–P bonding in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster, with the aid of model D2d [ZnP4H8]2– cluster. Owing to the polar nature of Zn–P
bonding and the fact that two P7 cages contribute six electrons
for the eight-electron system, in contrast to two electrons only for
Zn center, the four Zn–P bonds in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster is anticipated
to be polar as well. On the basis of this understanding, the recovery
of four 2c-2e Zn–P σ bonds in AdNDP analysis (Figure 7e) can be an overestimation
for the system. Note that the ON values amount to 1.80–1.86
|e| for such bonds, which are close to ideal and markedly higher than
their WBIs (0.48/0.49; Figure 1). One way to reconcile this discrepancy is to take a closer
look at the shape of such AdNDP bonds, as illustrated in Figure 8 using model D2d [ZnP4H8]2– cluster.

Figure 8 AdNDP schemes for model D2d [ZnP4H8]2– cluster.
ONs are shown. (a) The 5c-2e ZnP4 σ scheme. (b) Four
2c-2e Lewis Zn–P σ “single” bonds. (c)
A scheme that separates “nonbonding” vs “bonding”
components, whose combination recovers scheme (b), as illustrated
at the right side. Scheme (c) reflects the essence of bonding in the
system, which also works for C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster.

Four 2c-2e Zn–P σ bonds with ideal
ONs (1.99 |e|)
are shown in Figure 8b. However, the shape of each bond is nonsymmetric for Zn versus
P centers. Alternatively, one can first isolate the nonbonding P 3p
component in AdNDP. Such a component is in the spirit of a lone-pair,
but with a much lower ON (0.91 |e|; Figure 8c, top row). Subsequently, one analyzes the
two-center Zn–P σ component, yielding an ON of 0.87 |e|
(Figure 8c, bottom
row). The latter represents the genuine covalent Zn–P bonding,
in line with their low WBIs (0.48/0.49). The inset in Figure 8 shows that schemes (b) and
(c) are equivalent to each other, that is, addition of nonbonding
and two-center components generates the 2c-2e Zn–P σ
“single” bonds. We reiterate that such “single”
bonds are rather weak despite their ideal ONs in AdNDP analysis.

4 Conclusions
We report on in-depth chemical
bonding analyses for a synthetic
charged molecular alloy C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster. Our effort makes use
of electronic structure calculations, NBO analysis, and orbital composition
analysis. To elucidate the nature of bonding, we have performed extensive
CMO analyses and AdNDP. The latter approach offers an elegant bonding
picture, which was seldom exploited in synthetic works in the literature.
Structural, electronic, and bonding properties of cage-like C3v [P7]3– Zintl ion are also examined, showing that three isolated bridging
sites carry the majority of negative charges. Such charges have considerable
P 3p2 lone-pair characters, but also participate in secondary
P–P bonding along bridging sites. This bonding picture
refines existing knowledge on naked [P7]3– Zintl ion. Charged molecular alloy C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster can be
approximately formulated as [P7]2–[Zn]0[P7]2–, in which [P7]2– ligands inherit the structure and bonding of
Zintl ion except for a difference in charge state. Each [P7]2– ligand interacts with the Zn center via two
bridging P sites, forming a quasi-tetrahedral ZnP4 core.
The eight-electron counting underlies the stability of this charged
molecular alloy, which can alternatively be considered as a superatom
or superatomic cluster. The Zn–P bonding in C2 [P7ZnP7]4– cluster
is weaker than anticipated for an eight-electron tetrahedral configuration
because the P centers maintain partial nonbonding 3p character, which
is in the spirit of lone-pair albeit with a much lower ON. As a consequence,
the effective Zn–P bond order is around 0.5.

5 Methods Section
Geometric structures of [P7ZnP7]4– cluster were constructed based on experimental
crystal data11 and subsequently reoptimized
using DFT29 at the PBE0/def2-TZVP level.30,39 C-PCM calculations31−34 were carried out to take into account the solvation effects, whose
performance has been tested recently in charged molecular alloy compounds.27 The NBO analysis was performed to obtain WBIs
and natural atomic charges, which serve as a crude measure of the
P–P and Zn–P bonding, as well as charge distribution
in the system.

To elucidate chemical bonding, CMOs were fully
analyzed following
the basic building principles, which is a sophisticated process considering
that [P7ZnP7]4– cluster is
an 86-electron system. CMO analyses were aided with orbital composition
calculations; the latter offers quantitative data on how a CMO is
composed of specific AOs. To simplify CMO analyses, the [P7]3– Zintl ion was examined first. The bonding pictures
of [P7]3– Zintl ion and [P7ZnP7]4– cluster were independently borne
out from AdNDP analyses, performed using the AdNDP program.35 The CMOs and AdNDP data were visualized using
the GaussView46 and Molekel47 programs. All electronic structure calculations
were carried out using the Gaussian 09 package.48 Orbital composition analysis and ECDA45 were performed using the Multiwfn program.49
