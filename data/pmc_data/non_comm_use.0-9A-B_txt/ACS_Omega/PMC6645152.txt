Icephobic
coating and surfaces are essential for protecting infrastructures
such as transmission lines, transportation vehicles, and many others
from severe damages of excessive icing. The slippery liquid-infused
porous surfaces (SLIPS) are attracting escalating attention because
of their low-ice adhesion strength. Despite all of the encouraging
laboratory scale results, the SLIPS are still far from being applicable
in real environments owing to the key unsolved problem, namely anti-icing
durability. Inspired by the functionality of the amphibians’
skin, lubricant regenerability was introduced to conventional SLIPS
and realized by a facile and scalable fabrication route. A series
of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based skinlike SLIPS were designed
and fabricated by using a one-step method, the solvent evaporation-induced
phase separation technique. The obtained skinlike SLIPS were able
to regenerate surface lubricant constantly by internal residual stress
because of phase separation and survive more than 15 cycles of wiping/regenerating
tests. Thanks to the regenerability of the surface lubricant, the
new SLIPS demonstrated durable icephobicity, showing a long-term low-ice
adhesion strength below 70 kPa, which was only 43% of 160 kPa that
for the pristine PDMS (Sylgard 184), even after 15 icing/deicing cycles.
This work paves a new and facile way for achieving icephobic durability
of SLIPS.

Introduction
Ice accretion on surfaces
of infrastructures, transportation vehicles,
and many others can result in severe damages; large-scale extreme
examples of that are the 2008 Chinese winter storms and the Northeastern
United States blizzard of 1978. The traditional anti-icing methods,
including active heating and usage of antifreeze liquid or salt, are
either too costly or environmentally harmful.1−3 It is commonly
conceived that the new generation of passive anti-icing surfaces and
coatings holds a promise.2,4 The superhydrophobic
surfaces (SHS), surfaces with low surface energy, as well as micro-
and/or nanotopography, have been widely investigated because of their
icephobic potential of repelling coming water droplets, delaying ice
nucleation, and reducing ice adhesion strength.4−12 However, this type of surfaces were proven to lose their icephobicity
in high humidity atmosphere. The SHS cannot avoid moisture condensation
in their surface micro- and/or nanotexture, which leads to the wetting
transition from Cassie–Baxter state to Wenzel state and finally
a catastrophic increase in ice adhesion strength.13−17 The slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS)
have attracted increasing attention for the low-ice adhesion strength
they can achieve.18−22 The SLIPS rely on the high mobility of surface lubricant for super
icephobicity and thus are free of the problems suffered in the SHS.
However, the SLIPS may lose their icephobicity because of the lubricant
removal by ice, in extreme case, after only one icing/deicing cycle.23

One of the key unsolved issues of SLIPS
is to enable the surfaces
to survive icing/deicing cycles, that is, anti-icing durability.15,24−28 Most of the previous studies on SLIPS focused on their low adhesion
to ice, yet only limited work had devoted to improve their durability.
Recently, Liu et al. attempted to increase the durability of SLIPS
via chemical modification and nanoengineering. They investigated the
effects of the surface chemistry, length scale, and hierarchy of the
surface topography of the underlying substrates on their ability to
retain the lubricant during repetitive icing/deicing.26 The results showed that the heptadecafluorodecyl trimethoxysilane-fluorinated
hierarchically microstructured SLIPS are more durable than the ones
without nanostructure and/or fluorination. Unfortunately, the ice
adhesion strength of their SLIPS increased from ∼60 to 700
kPa after 20 icing/deicing cycles, which is excessively high for practical
applications. Taking another approach, Coady et al. incorporated UV-cured
polymer networks into SLIPS to prevent the removal of surface lubricating
oil and maintain ice adhesion strength below 100 kPa for 13 deicing
cycles.23 These studies indicate the feasibility
of enhanced durability of SLIPS by increasing capillary force and/or
suppressing the release rate of lubricant. Despite the unremitting
efforts, new approaches toward durable SLIPS are still desperately
in need.

Living organisms can secrete surface lubricant and
liquids, which
inspires the design and fabrication of durable SLIPS. One interesting
creature, the amphibians, can actively secrete mucus to maintain hydrated
body surface.29 The functionality of surface
hydration refilling of amphibians is ascribed to the mucus glands
that constantly wet the surface soft epidermis. It is desired to fabricate
novel SLIPS with relatively simple structures, surely not as complex
as skins of real animals but possess similar or same surface lubricant
regenerating ability.

Immiscible liquid and a soft substrate
with porous structures,
which can act as mucus and soft epidermis, respectively, are essential
for imitating the function of amphibian skins. Polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) is a competent candidate for fabricating porous soft substrate
because it is viscoelastic and moldable. There are a wide variety
of methods for preparing porous PDMS, including direct templating,30−32 emulsion templating,33 gas foaming,34 phase separation,35,36 3D printing
technique,37 and so on.38 Typically, fabrication of SLIPS requires a separate step
of infusing liquid into the porous substrate. Here, in this study,
a simplified approach via solvent evaporation-induced phase separation
for SLIPS was developed, as the details are schematically shown in Figure 1. A homogenous solution
made up of Sylgard 184, liquid paraffin (LP), and hexane is first
prepared. Sylgard 184 is one kind of commercial silicone rubber, which
is hydrophobic and serves as the soft substrate and continuous phase
of the resulting coating. LP is the nonsolvent of PDMS and can act
as the lubricant of SLIPS. The hexane is the cosolvent of PDMS and
LP, which can dissolve PDMS and LP to form a homogeneous solution.
Thanks to the volatility of hexane, which can evaporate at room temperature.
The evaporation of hexane induces nucleation, growth, and coalescence
of LP droplets, resulting in phase separation and a mixture of two
phases: a continuous phase of Sylgard 184 and a dispersed phase of
LP. New skinlike SLIPS were obtained after the curing process. The
structure of the new skinlike SLIPS was carefully studied for elucidating
the mechanism of surface lubricant regenerability. The icephobicity
of the new surface was also investigated in this study. Strikingly,
the new SLIPS were able to regenerate surface lubricant, LP droplets,
even after 15 wiping/regenerating tests, which led to long-term low-ice
adhesion <70 kPa after 15 icing/deicing cycles, outperforming many
other SLIPS.

Results and Discussion
Morphology of the Novel
Skinlike SLIPS
The as-prepared
skinlike SLIPS demonstrated a fine porous surface, as shown in Figure 2. The pores on the
surface were filled with lubricant, LP droplets, which were constrained
by the PDMS matrix. The size of droplets increased with increasing
LP content as expected. To further investigate the influence of LP
content on the pore size of the PDMS matrix, the skinlike SLIPS were
first immersed in fresh hexane to soak out the LP droplets and then
characterize the microstructure by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
As shown by SEM images with different scales in Figure 3, the pore sizes on the surface of the PDMS
matrix of three samples (Figure 3a,b,d,e,g,h) indeed increased with the LP content,
in agreement with the previous report.35 The pore sizes in the cross section (Figure 3c,f,i) of the samples showed the similar
pore size and same trend, which indicated that the pores evenly distributed
in whole PDMS matrix. The pore size was measured from the SEM images,
as the corresponding size distribution histograms shown in Figure 4. The distributions
of pore sizes in LP-0.25 and LP-0.50 were found to be close to unimodal
Gaussian distribution. In contrast, the pore size in LP-0.75 featured
a bimodal Gaussian distribution, which can be ascribed to the coalescence
of large LP droplets. The mean pore size increased from 0.80 to 3.78
μm with the increasing LP content (Figure 4d). High-concentrated LP is in favor of the
growth and coalescence of LP droplets, which is the reason of the
increasing pore size. The result indicates that the pore size of the
PDMS matrix can be tuned by simply controlling the amount of LP. It
should be noted that the pore size and distribution can be further
regulated by controlling the curing temperature and addition of the
surfactant.35

Regenerability of Lubricant Droplets of Skinlike SLIPS
The
most interesting property of the new skinlike SLIPS is the regenerability
of lubricant droplets. After the LP droplets on the surface was removed,
new droplets can regenerate, grow, and coalesce on the surface. To
study the regenerability of the as-prepared surfaces, an optical microscope
with an integrated camera was used to record the evolution of surface
morphologies after wiping off the LP droplets. As shown in Figure 5, the LP-0.25 was
taken as a representative of all three samples in the lubricant-wiping
experiments. Right after wiping the surface (Figure 5a), there were only some tiny droplets remaining
on the surface. After 10 min growth, the size of droplets became larger
with time (Figure 5b). From 10 to 30 min, the droplets kept growing and became much
larger and uniform (Figure 5c). More details for this regeneration process from 0 to 30
min are shown in Video S1 of the Supporting Information, which contain more frames of the evolution and demonstrated the
growth of droplets. The LP inside the PDMS matrix was squeezed out
leading to the growth of the droplets. When two or more adjacent droplets
grew to a certain size and contact with each other, they coalesce
to form a single large droplet. These coalescence events can be found
in Video S2 of the Supporting Information, indicating that coalescence also contributed to the growth of droplets.

micrographs of LP-0.25 at (a) 0, (b) 10, and (c) 30 min
after wiping the LP droplets off. The droplets grow larger and larger
with the time. Scale bar: 200 μm.

To further evaluate the durability of the skinlike surface,
repeated
wiping/regenerating test were conducted with all three samples. As
shown in Figure 6,
actively emerging LP droplets were still found on the surfaces after
15 wiping/regenerating tests, which indicates notable regenerability
of the skinlike SLIPS and the success of the biomimetics in this study.
Furthermore, the droplets size of LP-0.25 after 15 wiping/regenerating
tests is larger than that of LP-0.50 and LP-0.75. One of the reasons
for this is that more LP have been removed for LP-0.50 and LP-0.75
during wiping tests. Another reason is that the matrix of LP-0.25
can provide larger inner pressure to squeeze LP to the surface because
of smaller pore size.

LP-0.75
after 15 wiping/regenerating tests. Many LP droplets are found on
the surfaces after 15 wiping/regenerating tests. Scale bar: 200 μm.

The mechanism of surface lubricant
regenerability can be explained
based on Young–Laplace equation, as illustrated in Figure 7. The driving force
of the regenerability was the inner pressure (pi) of the PDMS matrix, which resulted from the residual stress
of fabricating process and larger than the atmosphere pressure (pa).39 The LP inside
the PDMS matrix was squeezed out by the inner pressure to form droplets
on the surface. With the growth and coalescence of droplets, the system
reached equilibrium state because of the Laplace pressure. After wiping
the LP droplets from the surface, the equilibrium state was broken;
then the LP will be squeezed out again until the equilibrium state
is reestablished. Hence, the regenerability can survive more than
15 wiping/regenerating test cycles.

Figure 7 Schematic equilibrium state of the skinlike
SLIPS. Laplace pressure
makes the system in a metastable state, where pi, pa, γ, and R are the inner pressure of the matrix, the atmosphere pressure, surface
tension of liquid, and curvature of the droplets, respectively.

Anti-icing Properties
Anti-icing properties of the
skinlike SLIPS were investigated by characterizing the ice adhesion
strength on the surfaces. There are many different methods to measure
the ice adhesion strength, including horizontal shear, tensile strength,
centrifugal shear, vertical shear, and so on.25,27,40−43 Here, the ice adhesion strength
on the skinlike SLIPS were tested by vertical shear test similar to
our previous reports.40−43 As shown in Figure 8, the ice adhesion of skinlike SLIPS, LP-0.25, LP-0.50, and LP-0.75
were measured to be 45.0 ± 16.4, 37.9 ± 13.3, and 58.9 ±
1.8 kPa, respectively. As the definition of icephobic surfaces was
suggested to have ice adhesion strength below 100 kPa,15,44 all of the three samples were below the threshold and were icephobic.
It should be noted that the ice adhesion strength on the skinlike
SLIPS was much lower than the value of Sylgard 184 with similar thickness
(300–400 μm). There are three factors which can influence
the ice adhesion strength: surface elasticity, surface topography,
and liquid extent.45 For skinlike SLIPS,
the low-ice adhesion strength can be attributed to modulus mismatch
between ice and PDMS matrix, and more importantly, the presence of
LP droplets, which can serve as lubricant and at the same time reduce
the real-ice contact area. In addition, mechanical interlocking may
result from the surface topography. For example, on comparing the
other two surfaces, LP-0.75 shows rougher surface, which can induce
mechanical interlocking; thereby, it displays higher ice adhesion
strength.

Figure 8 Ice adhesion strength of LP-0.25, LP-0.50, LP-0.75, and Sylgard
184.

Because of the high mobility of
surface lubricant, previous SLIPS
were not durable for anti-icing.26 To verify
the durability of the skinlike SLIPS, repeating icing/deicing experiments
were carried out, as shown in Figure 9a. All of the samples were found to maintain low-ice
adhesion strength below 70 kPa during 15 icing/deicing cycles, outperforming
many other SLIPS.23,26 The durability was expected,
given the regenerable LP droplets on the surface as well as the slow
release rate of LP because of high affinity between LP and PDMS.46 Moreover, we collected all of the ice adhesion
strength among the icing/deicing cycles and obtained the average value,
as shown in Figure 9b. The average value increased with the increasing LP content, which
is in agreement with the phenomenon in Figure 6 (the droplets size of LP-0.25 after 15 wiping/regenerating
tests is larger than that of LP-0.50 and LP-0.75). Besides, mechanical
interlocking effect is more significant in LP-0.75. In summary, the
results showed that the design of skinlike SLIPS with regenerable
lubricant indeed can improve the durability of SLIPS.

Conclusions
A series of new skinlike SLIPS inspired
by amphibians were fabricated
to solve the durability challenge by enabling the surface lubricant
regenerability. The lubricant regenerability of the new surface survived
more than 15 wiping/regenerating tests and resulted in a long-term
low-ice adhesion strength below 70 kPa, which is only 43% of 160 kPa
that for the pristine PDMS (Sylgard 184), after 15 icing/deicing cycles.
The low-ice adhesion strength resulted from not only the presence
of lubricant but also the modulus mismatch between ice and PDMS matrix.
The new SLIPS had simple composition, namely two key components of
LP and PDMS as lubricant and porous substrate, respectively, fabricated
by the one-step method based on the solvent evaporation-induced phase
separation technique. The fabrication process provided good control
on surface morphology and most importantly pore size for lubricant
regenerability, as well as upscaling potential. In addition, we believe
that better regeneration ability can be obtained by tuning the solvent,
lubricant, curing temperature, and so on. This work paves a facile
and scalable way for solving the icephobic durability issue toward
practical applications of SLIPS.

Experimental Section
Fabrication
of Skinlike SLIPS
The fabrication procedure
is described as follows. The homogeneous solution containing 2.5 g
of Sylgard 184 base, 0.25 g of LP, and 12.5 mL of hexane was first
prepared in a container, with 0.25 g of Sylgard 184 curing agent charged
into the mixture and stirred for 5 min. Afterward, 4 mL of the solution
was cast into a homemade mold, as depicted in our previous report.40 The solution was kept at room temperature for
60 min to allow the evaporation of hexane, followed by curing at 100
°C for another 60 min. The as-prepared surface was termed LP-x, where x is the weight (g) of LP. Herein,
three SLIPSs, LP-0.25, LP-0.50, and LP-0.75 with the thickness of
300–400 μm were prepared.

Characterization
Surface morphologies of skinlike SLIPS
and the evolution of surface morphologies after wiping LP droplets
off were recorded by a differential interference contrast microscope
with an integrated camera (Carl Zeiss, Zeiss Axioscope A1 for reflected
light). SEM was conducted in the field-emission SEM (FEI Apreo SEM)
to study the microstructure of porous PDMS substrates, which were
sputter-coated with a 10 nm platinum layer in advance. All samples
were immersed in hexane, which was refreshed every day, for 4 days,
to remove the LP from the pores before SEM. Ice adhesion strength
was tested in a vertical shear mode by Instron machine (model 5944)
equipped with a home-built testing system, as described in our previous
reports.41,42 Before the testing, 5 mL of deionized water
was first poured into a centrifuge tube, which was placed on the SLIPS.
The centrifuge tube was sealed by a pressure of 200 g of metal cylinder
to avoid water leakage. The specimens were then placed in a freezer
at −18 °C for more than 2 h to form ice on the surface.
Afterward, the specimens were transferred to the testing system and
stabilized at −18 °C for 30 min before loading. The force
probe was closed to the surface (<1 mm) and loaded with a speed
of 0.01 mm s–1. During icing/deicing cycles, the
samples were placed at room temperature for 30 min to recover before
the next icing process.
