A straightforward
protocol for the synthesis of functionalized
thieno[2,3-b]indoles by base-mediated [3 + 2]-annulation
of indoline-2-thione with Morita–Baylis–Hillman and
Rauhut–Currier adducts of nitroalkenes is described. Complete
regioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions
make this strategy very valuable. Moreover, the thieno[2,3-b]indoles comprising functional groups such as hydrazine
and ketoalkyl moieties are amenable for further synthetic elaboration.

Introduction
Organosulfur compounds
exhibit drug-like properties and thus they
have been widely exploited for medicinal chemistry applications.1 Thiophene and their fused analogues stand out
among various sulfur-containing compounds because of their excellent
medicinal properties.2 The indole-annulated
thiophene, particularly, thieno[2,3-b]indole, constitutes
a privileged structural motif and has gained considerable attention
among synthetic and medicinal chemists.3 Structures of some of the bioactive indole-annulated thiophene derivatives
are listed in Figure 1. The core structure, thieno[2,3-b]indole A exhibits antifungal activity4 and the substituted thieno[2,3-b]indoles have potential
medicinal applications for the treatment of neurological diseases
such as epilepsy, senile dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and
deficiencies of mental and motoric performance observed after conditions
of brain ischemia.5 Also, the natural product
thienodolin B has the same structural framework which
displays plant growth-promoting and -inhibiting activities in rice
seedlings.3,6 In addition to their pronounced pharmacological
properties, some of these scaffolds (D–G) are
also employed in organic electronics as electroluminescent materials7 and in the field of conducting polymers (H, Figure 1).8

functional materials (D–H) containing the thieno[2,3-b]indole
skeleton.

Owing to their wide range of biological
and electronic material
applications, various synthetic methods have been developed for the
synthesis of thieno[2,3-b]indole skeletons.9 The prominent strategies include deoxygenative
or palladium-catalyzed reductive cyclization of 3-(2-nitrophenyl)thiophenes,10 electrophilic cyclization of 2-alkyl-5-(2-isothiocyanoaryl)furans
in the presence of AlCl3,11 oxidative
cycloamination of benzothiophenes,12 radical
or palladium-catalyzed cyclization of 3-(2-bromoindol-3-yl)acrylonitriles,13 Paal–Knorr cyclization of oxindoles in
the presence of Lawesson’s reagent,14 and so forth. Recently, Deng et al. demonstrated efficient methods
for the regioselective synthesis of thieno[2,3-b]indoles
by Brønsted acid-promoted multicomponent reactions.15

Indoline-2-thione has been recognized
as a suitable binucleophilic
synthon for the synthesis of various indole-annulated heterocycles,16 and few reports are also available for the synthesis
of thieno[2,3-b]indoles starting from indoline-2-thione.17 Although many elegant methods are documented
in the literature, the development of novel and efficient diversity-oriented
strategies for the construction of functionalized indole-annulated
thiophenes are still desirable considering their synthetic and biological
significance.

Our group has long-term interest in the Morita–Baylis–Hillman
(MBH)18 and Rauhut–Currier (RC)19 reactions of nitroalkenes and their applications
toward the synthesis of several carbo- and heterocycles.20 Specifically, α-hydrazinonitroalkenes
prepared via MBH reaction of nitroalkenes with azodicarboxylates21 and an RC adduct of nitroalkene with MVK22 are well utilized as synthons for the preparation
of several functionalized carbo- and heterocycles.23,24 These are excellent Michael acceptors which participate in cascade
Michael addition–cyclization sequences.22−26 There is also the possibility of further exploitation
of the reactivity of hydrazino and ketoalkyl moieties that are retained
in the products. α-Hydrazinonitroalkenes were employed as substrates
for the synthesis of functionalized triazoles and arenofurans,23 whereas pyrazoles, furans, decalins, cycloalkanones,
spirocycles, and a bridged heterobicyclic compound epibatidine were
efficiently synthesized from RC-adducts.22,24,25 Very recently, we reported an effective
strategy for the synthesis of aminophenanthrenes and benzoquinolines
from RC-adducts of nitroalkenes using Hauser–Kraus reaction
of sulfonyl phthalide as the key step.26 As part of our ongoing program to synthesize functionalized heterocycles,
herein, we report a novel approach for the construction of indole-annulated
thiophenes from MBH/RC-adducts of nitroalkenes and indoline-2-thione.

Results
and Discussion
Our investigation commenced with a model reaction
between N-methylated
indoline-2-thione 1a and hydrazinated nitroalkene 2a in the presence of a mild base such as KOAc at room temperature
(Table 1, entry 1).
The desired product, fused thienoindole 4a, was formed
in 75% yield after 4 days of stirring. The role of inorganic and organic
bases was studied to improve the yield in short reaction time. When
the reaction was carried out in the presence of inorganic bases such
as K2CO3, Cs2CO3, and
NaOH, instead of the expected aromatized fused thienoindole, the dihydrothienoindole 3a was formed in 58, 27 and 62% yields, respectively, in a
relatively short reaction period (Table 1, entries 2–4). Subsequently, the
role of an organic base was evaluated by performing the reaction in
the presence of Et3N. In this case also the reaction exclusively
furnished the dihydrothienoindole 3a in 62% yield (Table 1, entry 5). Among
several bases screened, only KOAc delivered the desired product. After
successful screening of bases, we have investigated the effect of
solvents by using the optimized base KOAc. A brief evaluation of solvents
was then performed by conducting the reaction in tetrahydrofuran (THF),
methanol, and toluene (entries 6–8). Among the solvents screened,
THF and methanol provided the desired product 4a after
8 d of reaction, but the yield was inferior as compared to that in
CH3CN (entry 1). When the reaction was carried out in the
presence of 1 mol % acid additive, viz, acetic acid, the yield improved
to 78% and the reaction was completed in 4 days. These reaction conditions
were the best for this transformation (Table 1, entry 9).

After establishing the
best reaction conditions for this transformation,
we have investigated the generality of the reaction (Table 2). Various N-substituted indoline-2-thiones 1 and different hydrazinonitroalkenes 2 were
well tolerated, and the thienoindole derivatives 4 were
formed in moderate to good yields. The electronic nature of groups
present on the aryl ring of hydrazinonitroalkenes 2 did
not influence the product yield. The hydrazinonitroalkenes 2a and 2c bearing an isopropyl ester moiety and weakly
and strongly electron-donating para-substituted aryl groups on reaction
with 1a afforded the corresponding products 4a and 4c in 78 and 66% yield (entries 1 and 3), respectively.
Likewise, the hydrazinonitroalkene 2e having a weakly
electron-withdrawing aryl substituent also produced the product 4e in 66% yield (entry 5). Comparable to those bearing electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing aryl groups, a lower yield (58%) was obtained
in the case of the electron-neutral substrate 2b (entry
2). The methodology was further generalized with the heterocycle-substituted
hydrazinonitroalkene 2f, which also reacted smoothly
with 1a to provide the desired fused thienoindole derivative 4f in 40% yield (entry 6). Additionally, the bulky tert-butyl dicarboxylate-containing hydrazinonitroalkene 2d is also compatible for this transformation and delivered 4d in 75% yield (entry 4).

d Short reaction time allows isolation

e Complex mixture.

Next, the substrate scope with regard to N-substituted
indoline-2-thione
was studied. It was found that various N-protected thioindoles 1b–d, including ethyl, n-propyl, and
benzyl, reacted efficiently and provided the desired products in decent
to good yields (43–64%) (Table 2, entries 7–9). It is worth to stress that the
synthesis of desired aromatized thienoindoles requires a prolonged
reaction time (2–8 days), but it is impressive by considering
the outcome of the reaction. When the reaction was allowed to proceed
for short  time, for instance, the reaction of N-methylated indoline-2-thione 1a with hydrazinonitroalkene 2a under the optimized
reaction conditions provided dihydrothienoindole 3a in
46% yield after 3 h (Table 2, entry 10). Unfortunately, hydrazinonitroalkenes bearing
an alkyl group such as cyclohexyl as in 2g was not suitable
for our reaction (Table 2, entry 11).

The synthesized indole-annulated thiophene derivatives 4a–i were characterized by usual spectroscopic analyses.
In most cases,
these compounds showed signal broadening in the NMR spectrum because
of the presence of rotamers. The partial double bond character of
carbamate in the hydrazine moiety is responsible for the existence
of rotamers, and additionally, the quadrupolar effect of N-atoms present
in the hydrazine moiety complicates the NMR spectra (Scheme 1). To study this dynamic NMR
phenomenon, variable-temperature 1H NMR experiments were
conducted by taking 4g as the representative compound
(Figure 2). The spectra
were recorded in the range of 296–328 K, but only marginal
changes were observed in the spectral pattern. Although the signals
for most of the aromatic and N–Et protons were reasonably well
resolved and methyl protons of the isopropyl group remained unresolved
at all of the temperatures studied, gradual resolution of one of the
isopropyl methine protons resonating at 4.98–5.08 ppm was discernible
upon increasing the temperature. A similar resolution was observed
for two of the aromatic protons resonating at ∼7.50 ppm. The
two broad signals appearing at ∼7.00 and 6.85 ppm in approximately
2:1 ratio, assigned for the N–H of two rotamers, in the spectrum
recorded at 296 K coalesce at 313 K and become sharper at higher temperature.
Overall, the sharper signals observed for the protons upon increasing
the temperature are attributed to faster rotation about the C–N
bond. Furthermore, the structure and regiochemistry of both indole-fused
thiophenes and dihydrothienoindole were established by single-crystal
X-ray analysis of compounds 4h and 3a (Figure 3).

in the range 296–328 K.

Scheme 1 Possible Isomers of 4g
On the basis of the results
obtained and the literature precedents,16,17 a logical
mechanism for the formation of indole-annulated thiophene 4 is proposed in Scheme 2. The anion, generated from indoline-2-thione 1 by abstraction
of a proton from C-3 position, adds in a
Michael fashion to hydrazinonitroalkene 2, which
is activated by AcOH via H-bonding, leading to the formation of intermediate I. The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of the
hydrazine moiety participates in the elimination of the nitro group
in intermediate I and generates a transient acyliminium-type
intermediate II. Subsequently, the intramolecular cyclization
of II occurs in a 5-exo-trig fashion,
resulting in the formation of dihydrothienoindole 3 which
on air oxidation gives the desired aromatized thienoindole 4. Alternatively, the reaction can proceed in another pathway starting
from intermediate I. Thio-enolization of I followed by intramolecular 5-exo-tet cyclization and subsequent air oxidation results in the formation
of thieno[2,3-b]indole 4 (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Mechanism of Formation
of Thienoindole 4 from Hydrazinonitroalkene 2 and Indoline-2-thione 1
To further demonstrate the scope of the developed method
for the
synthesis of diversely functionalized fused thienoindoles, we employed
the RC adduct of nitroalkene 5 with MVK 5 as the reaction partner with indoline-2-thione 1. The
initial reaction was performed by treating 1a with the
RC adduct 5a under the established reaction conditions
(Table 3, entry 1).
As expected, the indole-annulated thiophene 6a was formed,
but the yield was quite low (20%) after 19 h stirring at room temperature.
To improve the yield of the reaction, optimization studies were conducted
by varying the bases, solvents, and additives by choosing 1a and 5a as the model substrates. Initially, we screened
several organic and inorganic bases in acetonitrile medium. When the
reaction was carried out in the presence of an organic base, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU), the yield slightly improved to 44% in 1 h (Table 3, entry 2). Subsequent screening
of milder inorganic bases such as K2CO3 and
Cs2CO3 and stronger inorganic bases such as
NaOH and KOtBu revealed that the milder
base K2CO3 promoted the reaction efficiently
and delivered the product in 71% yield in 15 h (entries 3–6).
Different solvents were then screened by selecting K2CO3 as the optimal base (entries 7–9). A considerable
decline in yield was observed when the reaction was performed in other
solvents such as THF, CHCl3, and toluene, and the initially
employed medium CH3CN was found to be suitable for this
transformation. Further, the loading of the base was varied which
resulted in the formation of the product in reduced yield upon decreasing
or increasing the amount of K2CO3 from 1 equiv
(entries 10 and 11). Few additional experiments were performed by
employing the additives such as LiCl and H2O (entries 12
and 13). The additive, LiCl was found to be inefficient for improving
the yield (entry 12). The reaction was complete in 8 h and the yield
improved (76%) when H2O was used as an additive (entry
13). When the reaction was performed under microwave irradiation at
40 °C, the reaction was complete in 15 min, but a substantial
drop in yield (43%) was observed (entry 14). Finally, in terms of
chemical yield and reaction time, entry 14 has been considered as
optimal for this transformation. It may be noted that unlike in the
reaction of thienoindole 1 with hydrazinonitroalkene 2, the aromatized fused thienoindole 6a was isolated
in all of the cases when RC-adducts of nitroalkene 5a was employed.

With the optimal reaction conditions in hand, the scope of the
reaction was investigated with different substituted RC-adducts of
nitroalkenes 5 and indoline-2-thiones 1.
Initially, we focused on studying the reactivity of various substituted
RC-adducts of nitroalkenes 5b–l, taking thienoindole 1a as the representative reaction partner, and the results
are summarized in Table 4. In general, the electron-donating substituents on the aryl group
of RC-adducts of nitroalkenes 5 afforded the thieno[2,3-b]indole derivatives 6 in low to moderate yields
(28–51%, entries 2, 3, 5, and 6). In some cases, fairly good
yields (59 and 70%) were obtained when multiple electron-donating
groups were placed at different positions (entries 4 and 7). RC-adducts
of nitroalkenes bearing weakly electron-withdrawing groups (5h–j) were also subjected to the reaction. While high
yield (63%) was observed in the case of 4-chloro-substituted RC-adduct 5i, modest yields were obtained from RC-adducts 5h and 5j containing bromo- and fluoro substituents (entries
8–10). The RC-adduct of nitroalkene 5k containing
bulky 1-naphthyl group also participated in the reaction and furnished
the corresponding fused thienoindole derivative 6k in
comparable yield. Notably, the heteroaryl-derived RC-adduct of nitroalkene 5l also reacted with 1a and delivered the product,
though in low yield (31%).

c 10–20% 1a and 5 was recovered; prolonged reaction led to a complex mixture.

Subsequently, the scope of indoline-2-thione 1 was
explored by reacting a representative RC-adduct 5a with
different N-substituted and aryl-substituted thienoindoles 1 under the optimized conditions (Table 5). Various N-protecting groups such as ethyl, n-propyl, and benzyl were tested. Among these, N-ethyl- and N-benzyl-protected indoline-2-thiones 1b and 1d afforded the product in excellent yields
(87 and 94%, respectively, entries 1 and 3), whereas the N-propyl derivative 1c provided the corresponding product
in much lower yield (entry 2). Indoline-2-thione 1e having
chlorine on the aryl group (located at C-5 position) was subjected
to reaction with 1a, and the expected product was isolated
in moderate yield (44%, entry 4). It is noteworthy that the unprotected
indoline-2-thione 1f is also compatible for this transformation
and furnished the desired product in 44% yield (entry 5). Finally,
the structures of thienoindoles 6a–q synthesized
from RC-adducts 5a–l were characterized by analysis
of their spectral data and further unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray analysis of a representative compound 6e (Figure 4). (Table 5

b After silica-gel column chromatography.

A plausible mechanism for the one-pot synthesis of
thiophene-annulated
indole derivatives 6 from RC-adducts is outlined in Scheme 3. The base-mediated
Michael addition of indoline-2-thione 1 to the RC-adduct 5 generates intermediate I. Subsequently, an
intramolecular thio-Mannich-type reaction occurs in a 5-exo-trig manner resulting in the intermediate II which undergoes elimination of HNO and H2O to
afford the aromatized product 6.

Scheme 3 Mechanism of Formation
of Thienoindole 6 from RC-Adduct 5 and Indoline-2-thione 1
Because the thieno[2,3-b]indole frameworks prepared
from hydrazinonitroalkene 2 and RC-adducts 5 consist of functional moieties such as hydrazine and ketone, there
exist enormous possibilities for further synthetic manipulation. The
synthetic potential of these compounds was then highlighted by exemplifying
a specific one-pot transformation of thieno[2,3-b]indole 4d containing a hydrazine ester moiety to pyrazole-tethered
thieno[2,3-b]indole 8 (Scheme 4). Acid hydrolysis of 4d followed by decarboxylation generated the corresponding
hydrazine derivative which on reaction in situ with acetyl acetone
(Knorr-pyrazole synthesis) provided 8, though in moderate
yield (48%).

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a convenient
one-pot strategy for
the synthesis of diverse functionalized thieno[2,3-b]indoles from easily accessible starting materials. The base-mediated
[3 + 2] annulation of indoline-2-thione and α-hydrazinonitroalkenes
derived from the MBH-reaction of nitroalkenes and azodicarboxylates
provided the functionalized indole-annulated thiophene motifs in moderate
to excellent yields. In a similar fashion, the RC-adducts of nitroalkenes
underwent cascade cyclization when reacted with indoline-2-thione
and afforded corresponding indole-fused thiophenes in moderate to
good yields. Although a prolonged reaction time was required for the
construction of thieno[2,3-b]indoles bearing a hydrazine
moiety (2–8 d), the mild and metal-free reaction conditions
make this protocol quite attractive. Moreover, the hydrazine moiety
on the thieno[2,3-b]indole skeleton could be transformed
to pyrazole, which further broadens the synthetic applicability of
the developed strategy. Studies to further extend the scope of the
developed method for synthesizing novel heterocycle-fused indoles
by employing various indolines and functionalized nitroalkenes are
currently underway in our laboratory.

The coupling constants (J values) are given in Hz.
IR spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer,

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Thienoindole (4)
To a stirred solution of indoline-2-thione 1 (0.7 mmol, 1 equiv), KOAc (104 mg, 0.7 mmol, 1 equiv), and AcOH
(0.4 μL, 1 mol %) in CH3CN (3 mL) at room temperature
was added the MBH adduct 2 (0.7 mmol, 1 equiv). After

To a stirred solution of indoline-2-thione 1 (0.75 mmol,
1 equiv) and K2CO3 (104
mg, 0.75 mmol, 1 equiv) in CH3CN/H2O (97:3,
3 mL) at room temperature was added the RC adduct 5 (0.75
mmol, 1 equiv). After the completion of the reaction (monitored by
TLC), the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo and the crude
residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography by gradient
elution with ethyl acetate/pet ether (10–25%).

Procedure for the Synthesis
of Pyrazole-Containing Thieno[2,3-b]indole (8)
To a stirred solution
of hydrazinothienoindole 4d (54 mg, 0.103 mmol, 1 equiv)
in MeOH (1.5 mL) was added 4N HCl in dioxane (0.77 mL, 3.093 mmol,
30 equiv) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for
10 min, and then, acetyl acetone 7 (21 mg, 0.206 mmol,
2 equiv) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 12 h. After completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the
solvent was removed in vacuo and the crude product was partitioned
between EtOAc (10 mL) and sat aq NaHCO3 (10 mL). The organic
phase was separated, washed with brine (10 mL), dried over anhydrous
sodium sulphate, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was
purified by silica gel column chromatography by gradient elution with
ethyl acetate-pet ether (15–20%).
