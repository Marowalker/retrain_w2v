This work describes the practical
production of novel indigo derivatives
from commercially available and economically friendly indigo and investigation
for their potential use as diesel markers. Introduction of solubilizing
long alkyl chains into an indigo molecule via formation of arylimino
moieties at its carbonyl sites and amidation at its amino groups greatly
enhances the solubility in diesel and several common organic solvents.
Effects of the number and position of the alkyl chains on the absorption
behavior of the compounds are discussed. Because of their superior
absorption in a region where the diesel cannot absorb, indigo N-arylimine and N-monoacyl-substituted
indigo derivatives can serve as diesel absorption markers at detection
wavelengths of 590 and 575 nm, respectively. UV–visible spectrophotometric
analysis suggested that this target marker is stable in diesel for
at least 3 months under ambient conditions. Furthermore, physical
testing according to the American Society for Testing and Materials
standards indicates that addition of these markers at a concentration
of 5 ppm does not significantly affect the physical properties of
the original diesel, thus confirming the applicability of these compounds
for marking of commercial diesels.

Introduction
Fuel tax is an excise
tax imposed on the sale of fuels according
to the government rates, depending on the types and applications of
the fuels. Nowadays, fuel tax fraud, for example, by adulterating
fuel products with low-cost components, diluting the higher taxed
fuels with the lower taxed ones, and illegal oil smuggling, has become
an increasingly serious problem. These illicit actions result in the
loss of revenue to governments, poor fuel performance, and possible
emission of harmful pollutants. One of the effective approaches to
tackle this problem is the addition of silent markers into fuel products
in order to track the sources of the fuels, to monitor the quality
of the fuels, and to specify the types of the fuels in markets. Other
than the possibility of low-cost scalable production, the required
properties of fuel markers include: (1) solubility in the fuel products;
(2) invisibility to the naked eye when added; (3) no adverse effect
on the properties of the fuel products; (4) stability in the fuel
products for at least 3 months, which is the average shelf-life of
the fuel products under ambient conditions; and (5) detectability
with good sensitivity by a simple analytical method.1 Many kinds of the markers have been proposed for using
in petroleum products,2 such as porphyrins,1,3 anthraquinones,4 coumarins,5 phthalocyanines and naphthocyanines,6 and diazo compounds.2 However, the current number of suitable fuel markers is still too
low to provide sufficient choices of markers to authorized organizations
for regular change of marker types.

Owing to its natural abundance,
strong extinction coefficients
in the visible region, high stability at the ambient atmosphere, and
amenability to structural modification via several well-established
chemical approaches, indigo and its derivatives are one of the most
well-known historic groups of organic compounds widely used for many
applications such as dyes and pigments,7 medical active compounds,8 semiconducting
materials,9,10 and so forth. According to previous studies,
the indigo N,N′-diaryldiimine,
or so-called “Nindigo,” and acyl-substituted indigo
derivatives exhibited absorption in the range of 500–750 nm
in which some kinds of fuels such as diesel does not absorb.11−13The incorporation of the aryl
and acyl groups in these compounds allows introduction of solubilizing
long alkyl chains into the indigo cores. Therefore, in this work,
these two series of the indigo derivatives, whose structures contain
the long alkyl chain, as shown in Chart 1, were synthesized and investigated for their
potential use as diesel markers.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Absorption
Properties of Target Indigo Derivatives
As shown in Scheme 1, compounds 1 and 2 were obtained in 28
and 20% yield, respectively, from condensation of indigo with 4-(octyloxy)aniline
in the presence of TiCl4 and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane
(DABCO). According to 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy, alkyl and aromatic protons of these compounds showed
signals at δ 0.78–1.80 and 6.59–7.81 parts per
million (ppm), respectively. The presence of peaks at 3.87–3.96
ppm, which corresponded to the −OCH2– protons,
confirmed the successful condensation of indigo with 4-(octyloxy)aniline. Moreover, two broad singlet
signals at 9.12 and 9.61 ppm observed in a 1H NMR spectrum
of compound 1 indicated the presence of amino protons
on an indolinimine and an indolinone rings, respectively. However,
a peak of the amino protons of compound 2 could not be
clearly observed, possibly because of the steric effect from both
long alkyl chains. 13C NMR spectra of compounds 1 and 2 showed the signals of sp3 carbons
on the alkyl chain at 14.1–32.0 ppm with the signal of a −OCH2– carbon at 68.6–68.7 ppm. The signals of aromatic
and C=C carbons appeared at 109.7–159.1 ppm, while the
C=N and C=O carbons showed the signals at 160.2–161.3
and 185.6 ppm, respectively. Furthermore, high-resolution electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (HR–ESI–MS) also confirmed
the successful formation of compounds 1 and 2 by showing their molecular ion peaks at m/z 466.2496 and 667.4011, respectively. As for the solubility,
unlike indigo, both target compounds were found to have a satisfactory
solubility (>15 mg/mL) in diesel and common organic solvents such
as CH2Cl2, hexane, and methanol.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Compounds 1 and 2
Compounds 3 and 4 were prepared
from
two-step one-pot amidation between indigo and octanoyl chloride, leading
to the formation of compound 4 in 14% yield (Scheme 2). Because of the
coexistence of unknown impurities having similar Rf values, compound 3 could
not be completely separated from the reaction mixture and was obtained
at >90% purity according to 1H NMR spectroscopy. Upon
extension
of the alkyl chains from C7 to C15 by using
palmitoyl chloride instead of octanoyl chloride under similar conditions,
compounds 5 and 6 could be purely isolated
as dark blue and dark purple solids in 10 and 11% yield, respectively.
The low yield was attributed to the indefinable side reaction(s) that
became more competitive and suppressed the yields of the target compounds
upon longer reaction time. However, approximately 20% of the starting
indigo could be recovered from these syntheses. Similar to compounds 1 and 2, compounds 4–6 exhibited good solubility (>15 mg/mL) in diesel and common
organic solvents.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Compounds 3–6
The formation of compounds 3–6 was confirmed by the presence of 1H NMR signals of the
alkyl chains and aromatic protons at 0.78–2.88 and 7.00–8.24
ppm, respectively. In the case of N-monoacyl-substituted
compounds 3 and 5, additional signals of
the amino protons on the indolinone rings were found at 10.01–10.02
ppm. In the 13C NMR spectra, all compounds in this series,
alkyl carbons, aromatic carbons, amido carbons, and carbonyl carbons
on the indigo cores exhibited signals at 14.0–37.1, 112.5–152.0,
173.7–174.5, and 180.4–188.5 ppm, respectively. Moreover,
their molecular ion peaks observed by the HR–ESI–MS
were consistent with the calculated values.

According to UV–visible spectrophotometry,
solutions of
compound 1 in toluene and diesel exhibited pronounced
absorption peaks at 595 and 590 nm, respectively, as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1. However, the solution of compound 2 in toluene showed a broad and weak absorption peak at 675
nm, which could not be clearly observed in the diesel. Such a great
difference in absorption behavior between these two compounds was
possibly because of the electron-donating effect originating from
the 4-alkoxyaryl groups as speculated by the previous study.11 As for compounds 3–6, their absorption in toluene and diesel could be observed
in the range of 570–575 nm. It was obvious that the length
of the alkyl chain did not significantly affect the absorption behavior
of the compounds in this series. Moreover, the introduction of the
long alkyl chains via the formation of the imino groups resulted in
the longer absorption wavelength than the N-acylation
on the indigo core. This bathochromic effect was attributed to the
extension of π-conjugated systems because of the imino groups.

weak absorption,

b The compound was investigated in
the crude form at >90% purity.

In overall, as compared to the absorption feature
of diesel, all
compounds showed the absorption out of the absorption range of the
diesel. In terms of absorptivity, compound 1 showed the highest molar extinction coefficient (ε) value in
toluene, whereas compound 5 showed the superior absorption
in diesel, among all compounds. Therefore, compounds 1 and 5 have been selected for further investigation
on their potential use as the diesel markers in the next sections.

Quantitative Determination and the Stability Test of Compounds 1 and 5 in Diesel
As mentioned above,
one of the requirements for the fuel marker is to be invisible to
the eyes when added in the fuel products. To determine an appropriate
working concentration of compounds 1 and 5 in the diesel, colors of the diesel samples containing compound 1 or 5 at the concentration of 5–10 ppm
were visually compared to that of the pristine commercial diesel.
The result showed that at the concentration of more than 5 ppm, the
colors of the marked diesel samples became distinctive from the original
diesel. Therefore, the concentration of compounds 1 and 5 for marking the diesel selected for this study was 5 ppm.

According to UV–visible spectrophotometry, standard calibration
equations of the diesel solutions containing compounds 1 and 5 at their absorption maxima were determined and
used for quantifying compounds 1 and 5 in
the marked diesel samples. To be in accordance with the regular storage
time of the commercial diesels in the market, a total period for this
stability test was 3 months. As shown in Table 2, the results showed that the concentrations
of compounds 1 and 5 in the diesel samples
observed during the period of 3 months under the ambient condition
were found to be almost constant, indicating the sufficient stability
of these two compounds in the diesel.

Effects of Compounds 1 and 5 on Physical
Properties of Diesel
In this study, physical properties of
the diesel containing 5 ppm of compound 1 or 5 were investigated following the American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM) test methods in comparison with those of the unmarked
diesel to ensure that the addition of compounds 1 and 5 will not adversely affect the properties of the original
diesel. The values in Table 3 indicated that the physical properties of the diesel marked
by compounds 1 and 5 were very similar to
those of the unmarked one, suggesting that compounds 1 and 5 did not significantly change the physical properties
and quality of the diesel when used at this concentration.

As compared
to the vast majority of fuel markers previously reported
in the open literature,1,2 our marker type appeared to be
one of a few practically useful kinds of markers1,2,14 that enabled onsite detection at a relatively
low concentration by simple inexpensive UV–visible spectrophotometry
without any extraction or sample preparation needed.

Conclusions
In this work, we successfully synthesized two series of the highly
soluble indigo derivatives bearing one or two long alkyl chains by
treating naturally abundant indigo with the commercially available
4-(alkyloxy)aniline and acid chloride via a simple one-pot process.
All target compounds showed satisfactory solubilities in diesel, but
only the monoalkyl-substituted derivatives of each series, that is,
compounds 1 and 5, exhibited a pronounced
absorption peak at 575–595 nm in toluene and the diesel, which
is out of the absorption range of the diesel. The number and the position
of the long alkyl substituents introduced on the indigo core played
a significant role in the absorption properties of the resulting compounds.
The proper working concentration of compounds 1 and 5 in the diesel was found to be 5 ppm to be uses as the silent
absorption markers. At this concentration, quantitative UV–visible
spectrophotometric analysis was carried out under the ambient condition
to ascertain their stabilities in the diesel over 3 months. Finally,
the effects of compounds 1 and 5 in the
diesel were investigated under the ASTM test method conditions. These
experiments showed that 1- and 5-marked
diesel samples exhibited similar physical properties to the unmarked
one and simultaneously passed all tests. These results suggest that
indigo derivatives 1 and 5 had potential
application in stealth marking of commercial diesels.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
All chemicals were of analytical
grade, purchased from commercial sources, and used as received, unless
noted otherwise. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra
were collected in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) at 400
megahertz (MHz) for 1H nuclei and 100 MHz for 13C nuclei. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm relative
to the residual CHCl3 peak (7.26 ppm for the 1H NMR spectra and 77.0 ppm for the 13C NMR spectra). Mass
analysis was performed by using a HR-ESI-MS technique. Absorption
spectra of the compounds were collected in toluene and the diesel
at room temperature, and the ε values were reported in M–1·cm–1.

Synthesis of Indigo Derivatives 1 and 2
Following a published method,11,12 a 1.0 M solution of TiCl4 in toluene (1.02 mL, 5.20 mmol)
was added dropwise to bromobenzene (53.4 mL) containing DABCO (2.26
g, 20.2 mmol) and 4-(octyloxy)aniline (0.496 g, 2.24 mmol), leading
to the immediate generation of a white fume and light-brown precipitate.
After the fuming subsided, indigo (0.588 g, 2.24 mmol) was added,
and the resulting dark blue mixture was refluxed overnight (approximately
14 h). The resulting red-brown reaction mixture was then filtered
while still warm, and bromobenzene was removed from the filtrate under
vacuum. After that, a crude product was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (400 mL), washed with deionized (ID) water (3 ×
200 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated
to dryness. Subsequent purification using column chromatography [silica,
CH2Cl2/hexanes (2:1)] yielded compounds 1 and 2.

General Synthesis Procedure
of Indigo Derivatives 3–6
Following a
published procedure,13 a solution of indigo
(0.803 g, 3.10 mmol) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP, 38.25 mL) was treated with sodium hydride (0.294 g, 12.2 mmol)
at room temperature for 2 h. Then, octanoyl chloride (1.984 g, 12.20
mmol) or palmitoyl chloride (3.364 g, 12.24 mmol) was added, and the
reaction was continued at room temperature for additional 24 h. After
that, the reaction mixture was poured into the deionized (DI) water
and extracted with ethyl acetate. To remove NMP, the organic layer
was washed with a saturated solution of NaCl and then with DI water.
The resulting organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated to dryness. Purification by a silica
column [hexanes/ethyl acetate (4:1)] yielded the desired compounds.

Investigation of Working
Concentrations of Markers 1 and 5 in Diesel
A 100 ppm stock solution of
each marker in diesel was prepared by dissolving compound 1 or 5 (0.005 g) with diesel in a 50 mL volumetric flask.
Then, this solution (0.25 and 0.50 mL) was further diluted with the
diesel in 5 mL volumetric flasks to obtain solutions with final concentrations
of 5 and 10 ppm, respectively. After that, the color of the resulting
solutions was visually compared with that of the commercial diesel.

Quantitative Determination and the Stability Test of Compounds 1 and 5 in Diesel
A series of calibration
solutions of compounds 1 and 5 in the diesel
was prepared at the concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, and 50 ppm
by diluting the aforementioned 100 ppm stock solutions (0.5, 1.0,
1.5, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 mL, respectively) with the diesel in 10 mL
volumetric flasks. The absorption spectrum of each calibration solution
was recorded by a UV–visible spectrophotometer. The calibration
equations for compounds 1 and 5 were obtained
from the slopes of plots between absorbance at 590 nm for compound 1 and at 575 nm for compound 5 (y-axis) and the concentration of compounds 1 and 5 in ppm (x-axis). These equations were used
to quantify compounds 1 and 5 in the solution
samples analyzed in the stability test.

The stability of both
compounds in the diesel was evaluated over a period of 3 months. A
set of nine sealed vials containing 5 ppm solutions of each compound
in the diesel (5 mL) was stored under the ambient condition. After
1, 2, and 3 months, the solutions from 3 vials were measured for their
absorbance at 590 nm for compound 1 and at 575 nm for
compound 5 by the UV–visible spectrophotometer.
The quantities of compounds 1 and 5 in the
diesel were then determined by the abovementioned calibration equations.

Effect of Compounds 1 and 5 on the
Physical Properties of Diesel
The 5 ppm solutions of compounds 1 and 5 in the diesel were prepared by dissolving
the aforementioned 100 ppm stock solutions (50 mL) with the diesel
in a 1 L volumetric flask. The physical properties of these marked
diesel samples were examined in comparison with those of an unmarked
one according to the ASTM test methods.
