Aromatic methoxymethyl
(MOM) ethers behave differently from aliphatic
MOM ethers upon treatment with trialkylsilyl triflate (R3SiOTf) and 2,2′-bipyridyl. The aromatic MOM ethers are first
converted to silyl ethers and subsequently deprotected by hydrolysis
to give the mother alcohols when the R3SiOTf used is trimethylsilyl
triflate (TMSOTf). Conversely, direct conversion of aromatic MOM ethers
to aromatic triethylsilyl (TES) ethers is possible when the R3SiOTf used is triethylsilyl triflate (TESOTf).

Introduction
Protecting the hydroxyl
group plays an important role in the multistep
synthesis of natural products. A number of protecting groups for hydroxyl
functions have been developed, such as the methoxymethyl (MOM) group,
which is a widely used one due to the MOM ether’s resistance
in strongly basic to weakly acidic conditions. Therefore, the deprotection
of the MOM group generally needs strong acidic conditions. Then, the
substrates with acid-labile functional groups usually need other protective
groups, whose deprotection does not need such acidic conditions. However,
development of a new mild deprotection method of MOM ether, which
does not effect the substrates having labile functional groups, can
broaden the range of the use of the MOM group.1

We have recently reported that aliphatic MOM ethers form bipyridinium
salt intermediates upon treatment with trimethylsilyl triflate (TMSOTf)
or triethylsilyl triflate (TESOTf) and 2,2′-bipyridyl in CH2Cl2.2 Because these
intermediates are cationic species, they are susceptible to nucleophilic
attack by H2O, which affords the corresponding deprotected
products via hemiacetal intermediates.2a The reaction proceeds under mild, nonacidic conditions, allowing
this method to be applied even to substrates bearing acid- and base-labile
functional groups. A further application of this method is the easy
and direct replacement of MOM ethers with benzyloxymethyl (BOM) or
2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl (SEM) ethers in a one-pot procedure
(Scheme 1).2b

Scheme 1 Reaction of Aliphatic MOM Ethers with TMSOTf
(or TESOTf) and 2,2′-Bipyridyl
However, aromatic MOM ethers have reduced reactivity under
the
same conditions compared with that of aliphatic MOM ethers. We then
explored the reaction of aromatic MOM ethers with trialkysilyl triflate
and 2,2′-bipyridyl in detail and found the remarkable effect
of CH3CN as a reaction solvent and that the reaction mechanism
of aromatic MOM ethers is completely different from that of aliphatic
ones. Thus, treatment of aromatic MOM ethers with TMSOTf and 2,2′-bipyridyl
gives deprotected phenols, whereas the use of TESOTf in place of TMSOTf
results in direct conversion of MOM ethers to TES ethers. These observations
also allowed us to develop a chemoselective transformation on molecules
containing both aromatic and aliphatic MOM ethers.

Results and Discussion
We first examined the effect of solvents on the reaction using
phenol methoxymethyl ether (1a) as a model substrate
for reaction with TMSOTf and 2,2′-bipyridyl at 0 °C to
room temperature for the first treatment and at room temperature for
the work-up (Table 1). The starting material 1a was not completely consumed
even after 14 h of reaction time in CH2Cl2 (entry
1). The reaction did not proceed in toluene, a nonpolar solvent, and
only 1a was recovered (entry 2). Although the deprotected
product 2a was obtained in 41% yield in AcOEt, 1a did not react completely after 27 h (entry 3). Even in
more polar solvents, such as 1,4-dioxane or tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1a was not completely consumed (entries 4 and 5). However,
to our delight, the use of CH3CN greatly improved the reaction
and 1a disappeared within 15 min and gave 2a in a high yield of 91% (entry 6). In every reaction except entry
2, the TMS ether was formed first,3 based
on thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and the mother alcohol was formed
by adding H2O for work-up, the details of which will be
discussed later (see Scheme 2). Although the reason why the reaction time is greatly shortened
in CH3CN is not clear, TMSOTf may be activated in CH3CN by the formation of a complex between TMSOTf and CH3CN as reported previously.4 In
fact, when 1H NMR and 13C NMR studies were conducted
for the reaction mixture of 2,2′-bipyridyl and TMSOTf in various
deuterated solvents (CD3CN, CD2Cl2, THF-d8), remarkable movement of signals
was observed only in CD3CN.5 This shows that CH3CN has a strong effect with the complex
([Bpy·TMS]+–OTf) formed by the reaction of
2,2′-bipyridyl and TMSOTf. Previously, we have already proposed
the formation of the complex from 2,4,6-collidine and TMSOTf.6 In this case, it is expected that a similar complex
is also formed (see Table 1).

a The first
stage of the reaction
did not proceed.

Next, we
examined the generality of this reaction in CH3CN by screening
different substrates (Table 2). In the case of aromatic MOM ethers having
an electron-donating group such as a methyl group (1b) or a methoxy group (1c), the reaction proceeded well
to give the corresponding products 2b and 2c in high yields without any problems. However, substrate 1e with an electron-withdrawing nitro group required a longer reaction
time and heating, although the yield of 2e was still
high. This reaction proceeded satisfactorily even with sterically
hindered substrate 1d, which had a bulky moiety next
to the MOM group. Substrate 1f, with an ester group,
gave the deprotected product 2f in good yield. The MOM
ether 1g, which had an acid-labile functional group,
namely, triphenylmethyl (Tr) ether, was also deprotected without any
undesired reactions to give 2g in high yield. This result
indicated that this reaction is very mild and nonacidic. In addition,
this method is also applicable to the MOM ether of naphthol 1h.

Table 2 Reaction of Aromatic MOM Ethers with
TMSOTf and 2,2′-Bipyridyl in CH3CN
a The first
stage of the reaction
was carried out at 50 °C for 4 h.

The mechanism of this deprotection reaction was found
to be different
from that of the aliphatic MOM ether deprotection, as shown by TLC
behavior (Figure 1).
The aliphatic MOM ether is first converted to a highly polar compound,
a salt intermediate, and then the deprotected alcohol forms upon addition
of H2O (eq A). On the other hand, the aromatic MOM ether
first gives a less polar compound accompanied by a more polar one,
presumably a salt intermediate. When water was added, the less polar
compound disappeared and phenol, which was identified by comparison
to be a standard phenol, appeared (eq B). The less polar compound
was unambiguously determined to be the TMS ether of phenol, as revealed
by NMR spectroscopy in CD3CN.3

Figure 1 TLC
behaviors of aliphatic MOM ethers (A) and aromatic MOM ethers
(B) in the deprotection reaction.

Based on these results, we proposed that the mechanism of
this
deprotection reaction proceeded as shown in Scheme 2. The complex ([Bpy·TMS]+–OTf) coordinates to the oxygen atom next to the aromatic ring and
compound A and salt intermediate C are formed.7 Then, compound A is hydrolyzed to
give phenol. In the case of aromatic MOM ethers, it is thought that
the complex ([Bpy·TMS]+–OTf) preferentially
coordinates to the more highly Lewis basic oxygen atom on the methyl
side of the acetal. But because of the equilibrium reaction, it is
presumed that some complex ([Bpy·TMS]+–OTf)
is also coordinated to the oxygen atom on the aromatic ring side,
and the reaction proceeds only when the complex is coordinated to
the aromatic side oxygen. Compared with aliphatic MOM ethers, the
difference in electron density between two oxygen atoms of an aromatic
MOM ether is considered to be a factor. This reaction mechanism reflects
the difference in reactivity depending on the substituents such as
when the substrate with a nitro group required longer reaction time
and heating relative to other substrates. This is probably because
it was difficult for the complex ([Bpy·TMS]+–OTf) to coordinate to the electron-deficient oxygen atom. In addition,
it can be said that the presence of 2,2′-bipyridyl is important
because this reaction did not proceed with TMSOTf alone.

Since
the binding energy between the aromatic oxygen and trimethylsilyl
group is not so high,8 it was readily hydrolyzed
to give the phenol products. Therefore, if we could form a stronger
O–Si bond, a stable silyl ether could be obtained. We then
conducted an experiment using TESOTf in place of TMSOTf and succeeded
in directly obtaining aromatic TES ethers, which is not possible with
aliphatic MOM ethers as shown in Scheme 1. The reactivity profile of the TESOTf reaction
was found to be similar to that of the TMSOTf (Table 3). Almost all the substrates 1a–h afforded the corresponding TES ethers 3a–h in excellent yields; substrate 1e, which has an electron-withdrawing nitro group that required
a longer reaction time and heating, still afforded TES ether 3e in moderate yield (63%). To the best of our knowledge,
such a direct conversion of MOM ethers to TES ethers has not been
reported so far.

TESOTf and 2,2′-Bipyridyl
a The reaction was
carried out at
0–80 °C.

b The
reaction was carried out at
0–40 °C.

This
interesting difference in reactivity between aromatic and
aliphatic MOM ethers was exploited by performing the reaction on substrate 4, which has both types of MOM groups (Table 4). The aromatic MOM ether was converted to
the corresponding TES ether, and after the addition of H2O, the aliphatic MOM ether was deprotected via the salt intermediate
to give hydroxyl TES ether 5a in 88% yield (entry 1).
When benzyl alcohol was added in place of H2O, product 5b, which had benzyloxymethyl (BOM) and TES ethers in the
same molecule was obtained in 81% yield (entry 2). Furthermore, the
use of trimethylsilylethanol as ROH gave product 5c,
which contains both trimethylsilylethoxymethyl (SEM) and TES ethers
in 78% yield (entry 3). Because many multistep reactions utilize MOM
ethers, we believe that this method will be useful and practical.

Conclusions
We found that aromatic
MOM ethers have different reaction pathways
than aliphatic MOM ethers under the conditions of TMSOTf (or TESOTf)
and 2,2′-bipyridyl. In other words, the aromatic MOM ether
was deprotected via TMS ethers rather than via salt intermediates.
This difference in reactivity also allowed us to develop an unprecedented
conversion of an aromatic MOM ether directly to a TES ether. These
are very mild conditions, so it can also retain the trityl ether,
which is removed under normal acidic conditions. Additionally, we
showed that the difference in reactivity could be exploited by performing
a chemoselective reaction on a substrate containing both aliphatic
and aromatic MOM ethers.

Reaction of Substrate with Aromatic and Aliphatic
MOM Ethers
(Table 4)
(Entry 1) TESOTf (0.45 mL, 2.0 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution
of MOM ether 4 (119.8 mg, 0.50 mmol) and 2,2′-bipyridyl
(390.5 mg, 2.5 mmol) in CH3CN (5.0 mL) at 0 °C under
N2 atmosphere. The solution was stirred for 1.5 h at room
temperature. Saturated NaHCO3 aq (4.0 mL) was added to
the reaction mixture and the resulting solution was stirred for 4
h at 50 °C. The organic compounds were then extracted with AcOEt,
and the combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue
was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to give 5a (117.3 mg, 0.44 mmol, 88%). 5a(20) is a known compound.
