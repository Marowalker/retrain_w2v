1 Introduction
In recent years, noble
metal atom(s) (including Rh, Pd, Pt, Au,
and Ag)-embedded single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), acting as
the catalytic center for gas interactions,1 have aroused considerable interest among the research community.
It has been reported that chemisorption could be achieved in systems
where noble metal-embedded CNTs were proposed for gas adsorption2 with a significant change in physicochemical
properties and enhanced adsorption behavior compared with intrinsic
CNTs which performs weak physisorption instead.3 Furthermore, the N-modified CNT was exploited not only
as an effective catalyst for gas adsorption4 but also as nanosupport anchoring metal atoms5 to obtain combined catalytic activity for gas interactions.
Increasingly, the existence of the pyridine-like N3 group
in the sidewall of single-walled CNTs has been demonstrated by electron
energy loss spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements.6 Moreover, it has been reported that the N3-CNT possesses desirable sensitivity and reactivity to various
gas molecules because of the introduction of novel states near the
Fermi level for CNTs by doping N atoms.7 In this regard, the pyridine-like N-modified CNT is regarded as
a promising support immobilizing certain noble metal atoms to gain
superimposed catalytic property toward gas interactions.

The
study of interactions between pyridine-like N3-doped
CNTs (N3-CNTs) and noble metal atoms is meaningful to understand
the transformations in structural and electronic behaviors of that
support induced by metal dopants and to exploit potential applications
for the metal-embedded structures. In this work, the physicochemical
behaviors of Rh-, Pd-, and Pt-decorated N3-CNTs (MN3-CNTs, M represents Rh, Pd, or Pt) along with adsorption behavior
of MN3-CNTs upon CO and CH4 molecules were comprehensively
investigated using the first-principles theory. Although there have
been experimental reports investigating the sensing behavior of novel
nanomaterials toward such two gases,8 to
the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study concerning
gas adsorption on MN3-CNTs at the molecular level. Results
indicated that the noble metal-embedded N3 group would
provide CNTs with enhanced performance for gas adsorption compared
with noble metal-embedded surfaces because of the improvement of chemical
activity and electron mobility in our proposed configurations. The
findings in this report would be beneficial for exploiting a possible
adsorbent for CO scavenging with excellent adsorbing ability and a
possible sensor for CH4 detection with good sensitivity
and recovery behavior.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Decoration of Rh, Pd, or Pt Atoms on N3-CNTs
For comparison, we analyzed the electronic
property for pure N3-CNTs. Results show that three N dopants
in the N3-CNT system perform as electron acceptors withdrawing,
from the tube, 0.265, 0.266, and 0.248 e, respectively, thus forming
highly localized acceptor-like states at the Fermi level because of
the existence of lone pairs of electrons.9 That is to say, the N3 group in the N3-CNT
would induce nonbonding electrons in the sp2 orbitals of
the CNT. Figure 1 depicts
the most stable geometric configurations and deformation charge distribution
(DCD) of Rh-, Pd-, and Pt-decorated N3-CNTs. It would be
worth mentioning that the geometric structure of MN3-CNTs
here is in good agreement with the previous report which demonstrates
that the most stable decoration configuration for a noble metal on
N3-CNTs is the middle vacancy site.10 Besides, three metal atoms are protruded outside of the
N3-CNT sidewall to various degrees because of different
binding forces of M–N bonds. Detailed analyses for these structures
are as follows.

Figure 1 Geometric structure and DCD for Rh-, Pd-, and Pt-decorated
N3-CNTs. (a) RhN3-CNT system; (b) PdN3-CNT system; and (c) PtN3-CNT system.

For the RhN3-CNT configuration in Figure 1a, the Rh dopant is captured
by the N3 group with three Rh–N bond lengths of
2.040, 2.038,
and 1.922 Å. The Rh atom acts as an electron donator releasing
0.232 e to the N3-CNT, while the electron distribution
of the N3 center is further enhanced as a result of its
strong electron-withdrawing property. Similarly, three Pd–N
bonds are measured to be 2.224, 2.225, and 2.044 Å in the PdN3-CNT system shown in Figure 1b, while three Pt–N bonds are measured to be
2.167, 2.147, and 1.982 Å in the PtN3-CNT system shown
in Figure 1c. It could
be found that the average bond length of Pd–N is the largest,
followed by Pt–N, and the shortest one comes to Rh–N.
In other words, the binding force of M–N could be ordered as
follows: Rh–N > Pt–N > Pd–N. Meanwhile,
Pd and
Pt dopants donate 0.279 and 0.212 e, respectively, to the supports,
which makes the N3 group more electron-centralized. These
confirm the strong electron-accepting property of N3-CNTs
and the active electron-donating behavior of noble metal atoms.2 Practically, this also could be concluded from
the DCD of three MN3-CNT systems, where metal dopants with
a deep red area around behave as electron donators, while the blue
area is mainly located on the N3-CNT, indicating that it
accepts electrons from the impure dopants.

The density of states
(DOS) analysis for Rh-, Pd-, and Pt-decorated
N3-CNTs was implemented as well to give further insight
into the electronic behavior of these structures. As shown in Figure 2, the partial DOS
curves of metal dopants (Rh, Pd, and Pt) and the N3 group
match well with total DOS curves of the related whole system, especially
those areas near the Fermi level, where the metal dopant in every
system even contributes more to the total DOS than the N3 group. That is to say, the electronic behavior of MN3-CNTs would be largely tuned by the metal dopants. From the partial
DOS, we could find that the Rh 4d, Pd 4d, and Pt 5d orbitals are strongly
hybridized with the N 2p orbital, leading to the large area of overlap
in their DOS curves. This means that the chemical interaction occurs
between Rh, Pd, or Pt atoms and N3-CNTs, causing evident
electron transfer and making the noble metal-decorated systems more
active.11

the Fermi level. (a) RhN3-CNT system; (b) PdN3-CNT system; and (c) PtN3-CNT system.

2.2 Adsorption of CO onto the Rh-, Pd-, or Pt-Decorated
N3-CNT Surface
The most stable configuration for
CO adsorption onto the MN3-CNT surface and the related
total charge density (TCD) are depicted in Figure 3. To begin with, one can see an obvious overlap
of electron cloud between MN3-CNTs and CO molecules, which
indicates a strong interaction in the three systems.

Figure 3 Adsorption configuration
and TED of MN3-CNT/CO systems.
(a) RhN3-CNT/CO system; (b) PdN3-CNT/CO system;
and (c) PtN3-CNT/CO system.

For the RhN3-CNT/CO system shown in Figure 3a, we can find that the Rh–N
bonds are stretched to 1.996, 2.145, and 2.090 Å, and the C atom
of the adsorbed CO molecule is attached by the Rh dopant with a bond
length of 1.897 Å. It is worth noting that the sum of single
bond covalent radii of Rh and C (2.00 Å)12 is even shorter than the obtained bond length Rh–C in this
configuration, which provides a potent evidence demonstrating the
strong binding force of Rh toward the CO molecule and the chemisorption
nature for the CO molecule onto the RhN3-CNT.13Ead in this system
is −2.00 eV and QT is 0.232 e transferring
from the gas molecule to the adsorbent surface. Both values are larger
than the reported ones of −1.94 eV for Ead and 0.20 e for QT in the Rh-CNT/CO
system,14 which indicates that the N3 dopant could effectively enhance the reaction activity of
CNTs and thus improve its adsorption ability toward the CO molecule.
In addition, the C–O bond of the CO molecule is somewhat elongated
to 1.161 Å after adsorption compared with the value of 1.142
Å for the isolated molecule, which means that the CO molecule
is activated during the interaction with the RhN3-CNT surface.15

Upon PdN3-CNT/CO and PtN3-CNT/CO systems
in Figure 3b,c, it
could be observed that, like the geometry of the RhN3-CNT/CO
system, the C atom of the CO molecule prefers to be adsorbed and trapped
by metal dopants with formed bond lengths of 1.893 Å for the
PdN3-CNT/CO system and 1.840 Å for the PtN3-CNT/CO system. It is interesting to illustrate that the bond lengths
of Pd–C and Pt–C in two adsorbed systems are both shorter
than the sum of covalent radii of Pd and C (1.95 Å) along with
Pt and C (1.98 Å), which confirms the strong binding force of
noble metal dopants (Pd and Pt) toward the CO molecule and leads to
the formation of chemical bonds in these systems. Moreover, a similar
phenomenon in these two configurations is that one M–N bond
is broken and the other two deform to various degrees after CO adsorption,
enlarging to 2.129 and 2.217 Å for the PdN3-CNT/CO
system and to 2.207 and 2.102 Å for the PtN3-CNT/CO
system. This is in agreement with the analysis in a previous reference
that metal dopants possess a strong binding force toward the CO molecule.16

The Ead values
are calculated to be
−1.90 and −2.94 eV, while QT values are calculated to be 0.197 and 0.178 e for PdN3-CNT/CO and PtN3-CNT/CO systems, respectively. It would
be worth noting that, according to previous reports, Ead and QT are −1.81
eV and 0.168 e for the Pd-CNT/CO system,2 while they are −1.73 eV and −0.12 e for the Pt-CNT/CO
system, respectively.17 This demonstrates
that the embedded MN3 group in the CNT would provide the
system with enhanced performance toward CO adsorption compared with
its metal-doped counterpart. Moreover, the C–H bond of the
CH4 molecule is elongated to 1.160 Å in the PdN3-CNT system and to 1.167 Å in the PtN3-CNT
system. This agrees with the adsorption performance order for MN3-CNT toward the CO molecule of Pt3-CNT > RhN3-CNT > PdN3-CNT.

The DOS distributions
for three systems are plotted as shown in Figure 4 to further elaborate
the electronic behavior of CO adsorption onto noble metal atom (Rh,
Pd, and Pt)-decorated N3-CNTs. We can see that the total
DOS and partial DOS of three systems are to some extent similar to
each other. Specifically, the total DOS curves of adsorbed systems
witness right shift toward a higher region above the Fermi level compared
with isolated MN3-CNT systems. This could put down to the
electron-withdrawing behavior of MN3-CNTs that results
in the improved effective Coulomb potential consequently.18 At the same time, the total DOS curves of adsorbed
systems have seen significant deformations in comparison with the
isolated counterparts because of the dramatic DOS contribution of
the activated CO molecule, especially at the areas around the Fermi
level, −6, −7, and −9.5 eV. Practically, these
areas are mainly where the DOS of the C 2p orbital exists. We can
see that there exist apparent overlaps between the Rh 4d, Pd 4d, or
Pt 5d orbitals and C 2p orbital around these areas, indicating strong
hybridization between the Rh dopant and CO molecule,19 confirming the obvious chemical interaction between the
metal (Rh, Pd, and Pt)-decorated N3-CNT and CO molecule.
This finding is in accordance with our previous analysis.

2.3 Adsorption
of CH4 onto the Rh-,
Pd-, or Pt-Decorated N3-CNT Surface
The most stable
configurations and related TCD for MN3-CNT/CH4 systems are portrayed in Figure 5. Unlike the CO system, few overlap of electron cloud
between the gas molecule and adsorbent could be found in RhN3-CNT/CH4 and PdN3-CNT/CH4 systems,
while just a small area of overlap could be found in the PtN3-CNT/CH4 system. These indicate the relatively weaker
adsorption performance of MN3-CNTs upon the CH4 molecule compared with that of CO systems.

Figure 5 Adsorption configuration
and TED of MN3-CNT/CH4 systems. (a) RhN3-CNT/CH4 system; (b) PdN3-CNT/CH4 system; and (c) PtN3-CNT/CH4 system.

Practically, from the adsorption
configurations and parameters
of MN3-CNT/CH4 systems, we could clearly find
out that the MN3-CNT has weak interactions with the CH4 molecule as well. In the RhN3-CNT system, the
nearest atom-to-atom distance (D) between the adsorbent
and gas molecule is measured to be 2.551 Å. Associated with the
calculated Ead of −0.23 eV and QT of 0.091 e, we assume that this is physisorption
in the RhN3-CNT/CH4 system. Although the adsorption
parameters of Ead (−0.46 eV), QT (0.187 e), and D (2.048 Å)
are somewhat increased in the PdN3-CNT/CH4 system,
obvious orbital interactions are not identified, given the lack of
electron cloud overlap between the CH4 molecule and adsorbent.
After comparison, the PtN3-CNT becomes the only candidate
with relatively good adsorption performance upon CH4 for
promising applications. One can find that the CH4 molecule
is captured by the PtN3-CNT with a Pt-to-H distance of
1.812 Å, which is the shortest distance for CH4 molecule
adsorption onto Rh-, Pd-, or Pt-decorated N3-CNTs. On the
other hand, the C–H bond of adsorbed CH4 in this
system is elongated to 1.163 Å, indicating the strongest activating
behavior among Rh-, Pd-, or Pt-decorated N3-CNTs toward
the CH4 molecule as well. The PtN3 structure
undergoes dramatic deformations with one Pt–N bond broken and
the other two elongated largely. All these accord to the large Ead of −0.67 eV and QT of 0.278 e consequently. It is interesting to note that
in all the CO- and CH4-adsorbing systems, electrons transfer
from the gas molecule to the MN3-CNT surface. This might
be attributed to the strong electronegativity of transition metals
that provides the decorated surface with strong electron-withdrawing
property.14 In addition, both the PdN3-CNT and RhN3-CNT show stronger performance upon
CH4 adsorption with larger Ead and QT compared with Pd-CNT (0.148 eV
and 0.072 e20) and Rh-CNT (0.253 eV and
0.075 e21) systems, which confirms the
conclusion that the N3 group could effectively enhance
the adsorption performance of metal-doped CNTs toward gas molecules
through the improvement of electron mobility and chemical activity.

For detailed comparison of the electronic behavior among MN3-CNT/CH4 systems, we plotted the DOS distributions
for three configurations as exhibited in Figure 6. It could be clearly seen that in the RhN3-CNT and PdN3-CNT systems, the DOS curves for configurations
before and after adsorption are basically overlapped, especially one
area where novel peaks are found because of the contribution from
the adsorbed CH4 molecule. The slight change in two DOS
distributions could be attributed to the weak interactions that lead
to small electron transfer and little electron redistribution for
the whole systems. On the contrary, pronounced deformations could
be identified in the PtN3-CNT system after CH4 adsorption. In addition, the DOS peak for the CH4 molecule
around −7 eV is dispersed into several small peaks that contribute
to the total DOS of the adsorbed system largely. At the same time,
the hybridization between Pt 5d and H 1s could be determined as the
strongest among three systems given the largest overlap between the
DOS of such two orbitals compared with those in other two systems.
These findings are in accordance with previous analysis which manifests
that the PtN3-CNT has better adsorption performance upon
the CH4 molecule compared with the RhN3-CNT
or PdN3-CNT.

2.4 Application of Noble Metal Atom (Rh, Pd, and
Pt)-Decorated N3-CNTs
We first investigated the
recovery time for the desorption of gas molecules from the MN3-CNT surface based on transition-state theory and van’t
Hoff–Arrhenius expression,22 expressed
as 1  where A is the attempt frequency
determined as 1012 s–1 according to previous
report,23Ea is the potential barrier of desorption that could be deemed as equal
with Ead, T is the temperature,
and KB is the Boltzmann constant (8.318
× 10–3 kJ/(mol·K)). It would be inferred
that the larger Ead would lead to the
harder process for gas desorption and the improvement of temperature
can accelerate that process effectively,24 although this, the desorption for the CO molecule from the MN3-CNT surface, even at high temperatures, would be difficult
because of the quite large Ead. On the
other hand, it would be easy for the CH4 molecule to desorb
from the same surface instead, given the small Ead.

Detailed analysis of the recovery time for two gases
desorbing from the MN3-CNT surface in various temperatures
is exhibited in Figure 7. In short, the RhN3-CNT and PdN3-CNT have
slight potential that can be exploited to use them as CO sensors with
superior sensitivity, but they have bad recovery property with a working
temperature of about 700 K for their reversibility. In other words,
CO sensing by Rh- or Pd-decorated N3-CNTs would be a one-off
operation, which is too much of a waste of material and its efficiency
is low. Given the even harder condition for CO desorption from the
PtN3-CNT surface, it is inappropriate as a CO sensor. In
this regard, we assume that Rh-, Pd-, and Pt-decorated N3-CNTs could behave as an excellent CO adsorbent, especially PtN3-CNT which has a strong performance toward CO adsorption,
for removal of such toxic gas from a specific environment.

Figure 7 Recovery time
for the MN3-CNT/CO and MN3-CNT/CH4 systems in various temperatures. (a) MN3-CNT/CO
systems and (b) MN3-CNT/CH4 systems.

On the other hand, we assume that only the PtN3-CNT
is a promising candidate for CH4 detection compared with
the PdN3-CNT or RhN3-CNT, given its desirable
adsorption and desorption behaviors for practical application at ambient
temperature. This allows the application of the PtN3-CNT
for CH4 sensing with simple working conditions. The sensing
mechanism would depend on conductivity increase of the PtN3-CNT-based device in the presence of CH4 according to
the enlarged Eg from 0.012 eV for pure
PtN3-CNT to 0.311 eV for the adsorbed system.25 It is hopeful that the detection accuracy would
reach the ppm level given the obvious change in Eg and whole interactions between the sidewall of the PtN3-CNT and CH4 molecules.

3 Conclusions
In this work, the first-principles theory is adopted to theoretically
investigate the geometric and electronic structure of noble metal
atom (Rh, Pd, and Pt)-decorated N3-CNTs, as well as their
adsorption behavior upon CO and CH4 molecules. The main
conclusions could be summarized as follows:(1) After decoration
of noble metal atoms
(Rh, Pd, and Pt), the MN3 group becomes more electron-centralized,
conforming the strong electron-accepting property of the N3-CNT and active electron-denoting behavior of noble metal atoms.

(2) The embedded N3 group in
CNTs would provide the system with enhanced performance toward gas
adsorption, leading to larger values of Ead and QT compared with isolated metal-doped
CNTs because of stronger orbital interactions and chemisorption between
the adsorbent and target gas.

(3) Rh-, Pd-, and Pt-decorated N3-CNTs could behave as an
excellent CO adsorbent, especially the PtN3-CNT which has
strong performance toward CO adsorption, for
removal of such toxic gas from a specific environment; while the PtN3-CNT is the promising candidate for CH4 detection,
given its desirable adsorption and desorption behaviors for practical
application at ambient temperature.



Our
calculation would be meaningful for providing fundamental knowledge
of the geometric and electronic structure of the noble metal atom
(Rh, Pd, and Pt)-decorated N3-CNT, as well as potential
applications of the MN3-CNT for CO scavenging or CH4 sensing.

4 Computational Details
The whole calculations in this work were performed on the DMol3 package.26 The intrinsic
(8, 0) single-walled CNT that possesses good sensitivity toward circumstance
was created with a supercell periodic boundary condition as 20 Å
× 20 Å × 8.5 Å in order to prevent interaction
between adjacent cells.3 The generalized
gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
was employed to address the electron exchange correlation functions.27 The Brillouin-zone was studied by using the
Monkhorst–Pack scheme, sampled into 1 × 1 × 9 k-point,2 while the core treatment
used Semicore Pseudopots.28 The density
functional computation adopted the double numerical basis set including
p-polarization function.29 The energy tolerance
accuracy, maximum force, and displacement were set as 10–5 Ha, 2 × 10–3 Ha/Å, and 5 × 10–3 Å,30 respectively,
with a smearing of 5 × 10–3 Ha. A large enough
global orbital cutoff radius of 4.5 Å was implemented to ensure
the accurate calculation of total energy. All calculations were spin-polarized.

To characterize the adsorption behavior, the adsorption energy
(Ead) of each process was defined by the
following equation31 2  where the EMN3-CNT/gas, EMN3-CNT, and Egas represent energies of the
adsorbed system, metal (Rh, Pd, and Pt)-decorated N3-CNT,
and isolated gas molecule, respectively. Apart from that the Mulliken
population analysis was adopted to analyze the charge transfer (QT) between the gas species and decorated surfaces,
characterized by the electron value carried by each gas molecule.
In addition, Tkatchenko and Scheffler’s method was employed
to deal with the long-range van der Waals force for gas adsorption.32 For basis set superposition errors, little impact
could be caused in the Dmol3 package33 and thus we would not analyze it in the following part.
