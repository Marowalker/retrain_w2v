Inspired
by the rampant digestive disorders and the vast bacterial
infections, this study aimed at fabricating nanofibers made of inulin/polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) composite nanofibers (CNFs) using the electrospinning
technique and testing their prebiotic and antibacterial activities.
The inulin/PVA CNFs were tested for prebiotic activity with Lactobacillus species while Escherichia
coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were used to assess the antibacterial potentiality. During the
fabrication of the CNFs, different electrospinning parameters have
been carefully controlled, in order to produce nanofibers with relatively
uniform diameter, fewer beads, and high integrity. The different parameters
included variable solution concentration (material ratio varied from
14 to 20 wt %), applied voltage (varied from 15 to 25 kV), and solution
flow (ranged between 0.005 and 0.5 mL/min). The chemical characteristics,
thermal stability, and morphology of the formed CNFs were comprehensively
characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric
analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. Selected CNFs, showing
the best diameter uniformity and integrity, were tested for the prebiotic
and antimicrobial activity. A 38% increase in prebiotic activity of
CNFs, compared to their bulk solution, was observed. The antibacterial
activity of the selected CNFs was enhanced, from ∼40% (pure
inulin) to 70% (inulin/PVA CNFs) against E. coli and 45% against S. aureus. This study
investigates the prebiotic and antibacterial activities of PVA/inulin
CNFs and provides the foundation for inulin/PVA CNF use in the healthcare
sector, as in disinfectants and/or digestive disorders.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Digestive
disorders affect millions of people worldwide with potential
impact on human health and patient’s quality of life. Most
digestive disorders arise from the introduction of nonendogenous pathogenic
bacteria to the gastrointestinal tract. Usually, these disorders are
treated with invasive procedures and/or chemotherapeutic agents. Recently,
it has become popular to treat digestive disorders by herbal therapy,
especially when traditional therapy fails to treat the disorders.
The interest in natural herbal products arises from demands for functional
food and drug-resistant infection.1 Functional
food such as prebiotics can modify the human gut microbiota by suppression
of pathogenic bacteria and stimulation of beneficial bacteria.2 Modification and stimulation of the gut microbiota
is important in treating various digestive disorders and improving
human health.3

Inulin is a natural
product reported to have potential for prebiotic
activity. It is commonly found in chicory, dahlia, bananas, and tubers.
Inulin has several medical applications, as in the control of high
blood fat, cholesterol, weight loss, constipation, and kidney function
test. In food industry, inulin is used to replace sugar in diabetic
patients. It is also used in ethanol production.4 Inulin is able to resist enzymes in human salivary glands,
stomach, and small intestines and only fermented by the microflora
in the colony.

Nowadays, nanofibers are at the forefront of
nanotechnology and
play an important role in human life. There are various methods for
nanofiber preparation including chemical, electrochemical, and electrospinning
techniques. Electrospinning has become the most convenient and attractive
method, given the ease and level of control of the formed nanofibers.
Electrospinning is characterized by its simplicity, ability to control
fiber diameter and shape, and low cost of nano–microfiber fabrication.
Electrospun nanofibers possess superior properties compared to nanofibers
fabricated by other methods and other nanomaterial forms where they
show high porosity, high surface area per unit mass, and so forth.
A wide variety of natural and synthetic polymers have successfully
been electrospun and have attracted great attention because of their
controllable properties and potential applications in various fields.
Examples of these applications are biomedical scaffolds, drug delivery,
wound dressings, batteries, and protective clothing.5

The properties of the electrospun nanofibers such
as fiber diameter,
fiber morphology, uniformity, and porosity are dependent on various
parameters. These parameters range from processing, solution, and
ambient parameters.6 Processing parameters,
which are considered as the controllable parameters, include the applied
voltage, solution flow rate, and the tip-to-collector distance. Appropriate
manipulation of these parameters would produce nanofibers with the
desired diameters and morphology.7 Moreover,
solution parameters include polymer molecular weight, solution viscosity,
and solution conductivity. These parameters have significant effect
on the electrospinning ability of the polymer solution. In addition,
ambient parameters such as temperature and humidity have significant
role in the successful fabrication of nanofibers.8

Natural polymers are frequently electrospun into
nanofibers, and
many examples of such natural polymers have been used to fabricate
nanofibers such as collagen,9 gelatin,10 chitosan,11 cellulose
acetate,12,13 and hyaluronic acid.14 They can be electrospun alone or in combination with other
polymers either natural or synthetic. On the other hand, synthetic
polymers are more widely used to fabricate nanofibers of desired properties.
Synthetic polymers include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),15,16 polyethylene oxide,17 poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid),18 and polylactide.19

PVA was selected in this study to assist
the fabrication of composite
nanofibers (CNFs) when mixed with inulin. PVA was selected because
it is a water-soluble polymer and approved by Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for use in medical applications.20,21 Additionally,
PVA is a biocompatible, nontoxic, and biodegradable polymer.22,23 Additionally, it is known for its fiber-forming capability and is
widely used in electrospinning of various blended fibers.24 After careful control of the processing and
solution parameters, the CNFs with the best uniformity and integrity
were selected for prebiotic and antibacterial testing against both
Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Chemical Analysis
2.1.1 Fourier Transform Infrared Analysis
The chemical structure
of the fabricated inulin/PVA CNFs was confirmed
by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Its representative
FT-IR spectra with comparison to its corresponding starting materials
are shown in Figure 1. The characteristic IR absorption bands of O–H stretching
of both inulin and PVA found around 3350–3400 and 3300–3500
cm–1, respectively, were found to be overlapped
forming a broader O–H absorption peak in the resulting inulin/PVA
CNFs. This might be because of the hydrogen bonding formed between
the OH groups of both blended materials. Additionally, the characteristic
peaks of inulin found around 1650 cm–1 and of PVA
around ∼1442 and ∼1716 cm–1 remained
the same in the resulted blended inulin/PVA CNFs with slight shifting
in the peaks, and this is might be because of the physical interaction
between the two materials.

with its starting
materials.

2.1.2 Thermogravimetric
Analysis
The
thermograms under a nitrogen atmosphere of the inulin/PVA CNFs in
comparison with the blended materials, inulin and PVA, are shown in Figure 2. The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) thermogram of the inulin/PVA CNFs showed a great enhancement
in the thermal stability of the inulin extract at which it started
to decompose at higher temperature range ≈ 338.9 °C, in
contrast to that of the pure inulin extract, which showed lower decomposition
temperature range ≈ 235 °C. Moreover, the CNF decomposition
temperature was observed to be closer to that of the PVA, which was
found to be around ∼323.19 °C. These results could be
because of inulin protection created by its incorporation within the
PVA nanofibers, in addition to the physical and chemical interactions
created between both the inulin and PVA.

CNFs in comparison with its starting
materials.

Loading capacity determination
using UV–vis spectroscopy
was carried out to determine the percentage of inulin inside the PVA
nanofibers. The results showed that each 100 mg of PVA contained 15.08
g of inulin, and the entrapment efficiency was determined and found
to be 87.52%.

2.2 Morphological Analysis
As mentioned
previously, different parameters have been changed through the nanofiber
preparation to achieve the most uniform nanofibers with least beads.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been used to investigate the
effect of different parameters on the morphology of the obtained nanofibers.

2.2.1 Effect of Concentration
The concentration
of the solutions used for electrospinning varied between 15 and 20%
w/w. During electrospinning of the solutions, dropping of the solution
occurred continuously at a concentration of 20 and 18% with no fiber
formation. However, upon decreasing the concentration to 16% (Figure 3a), fibers were formed
but dropping still occurred. Additionally, decreasing the concentration
further to 15% (Figure 3b) resulted in more uniform fibers and solution dropping decreased.
Accordingly, upon decreasing the solution concentration, nanofiber
formation was improved and solution dropping decreased. Furthermore,
as the concentration decreased below 15%, more uniform and less beaded
nanofibers were formed. These results were found to be in disagreement
with the results stated by Mit-uppatham, Nithitanakul, and Supaphol,
(2004),25 where solution dropping occurred
at low concentration, and increasing concentration resulted in the
formation of smooth nanofibers. At low concentrations, the viscoelastic
force is not large enough, resulting in the break-up of the solution
drop into smaller droplets (Mit-uppatham et al., 2004).25

flow rate
less than 0.1 mL/min and at applied voltage 16–18 kV from different
inulin/PVA blend solution concentration (w/w): (a) 15, (b) 16, (c)
18, and (d) 20% (w/w).

2.2.2 Effect
of Applied Voltage
Based
on the previous studies, the applied voltage is one of the most important
and crucial variables that affects the morphology of fabricated CNFs
as reported by Deitzel, Kleinmeyer, Harris, & Beck Tan, (2001).26 As the applied voltage was increased from 16
to 20 kV (Figure 4),
the monodispersity of the fabricated CNFs decreased and there were
broadening of the distribution of the CNF diameter. In addition, increasing
the applied voltage above 16 kV resulted in the appearance of few
beads, similar to previous reports (Zong, Kim, Fang, Ran, Hsiao, &
Chu, 2002).27 This could be attributed
to the formation of a Taylor cone from more amount of the solution
because of driving more solution through the syringe nozzle. Also,
the increase in the applied voltage causes rapid removing of the solution
from the needle tip (Deitzel et al., 2001).26 These results are in agreement with the results previously reported
by Li et al. (2007)28 and Kegere et al.
(2019)36 similarly reporting that at higher
applied voltage, a broad distribution in the nanofiber diameter is
produced where on the other hand, lower applied voltage assists uniform
nanofiber formation with narrower diameter distribution.

Figure 4 SEM images
(a,c,e,g,i) and their corresponding histograms (b,d,f,h,j)
of inulin/PVA CNFs from 15% w/w blend solution at different voltages;
16 (a,b), 17 (c,d), 18 (e,f), 19 (g,h), and 20 kV (i,j) at a solution
flow rate of 0.1 mL/min.

Therefore, in the current
work, several applied voltage values
ranging between 16 and 20 kV were varied; however, 16 kV resulted
in the best monodispersity and a narrower distribution of the nanofiber
diameter. As a result, 16 kV applied voltage was the best voltage
to fabricate uniform, monodisperse nanofibers with a narrower diameter
distribution.

2.2.3 Effect of the Solution
Flow Rate
The solution flow rate was one of the key factors
affecting the uniformity
and formation of beads in the resulted nanofibers. It was observed
that too low flow rate of 0.005 mL/min resulted in a slightly branched
and beaded nonuniform fabricated nanofibers as shown in Figure 5a. Moreover, a high flow rate
above 0.01 mL/min caused difficulty in electrospinning of the composite
solutions because of the overwhelming flow of the solution as well
as its high viscosity, resulting also in bead formation as shown in Figure 5e–i. Interestingly,
it was found that adjusting the solution flow rate at 0.01 mL/min
resulted in the disappearance of branching in addition to more uniform
nanofibers with much less beads as shown in Figure 5c.

histograms (b,d,f,h,j)
of inulin/PVA CNFs electrospun from 15% w/w blend solution at different
solution flow rates; 0.005 (a,b), 0.01 (c,d), 0.05 (e,f), 0.1 (g,h),
and 0.5 mL/min (i,j) at an applied voltage of 16 kV.

2.3 Physical Analysis
Inulin/PVA CNFs
were found to immediately dissolve when immersed in water, thus cross-linking
of the electrospun CNFs was required to prevent their water dissolution.
Inulin/PVA CNFs, electrospun from 15% w/w blend solution, were physically
and chemically cross-linked to select the best cross-linking method.
To investigate the effect of the different cross-linking applied on
the solubility stability of the obtained nanofibers, the water immersion
test was carried out as mentioned previously.

2.3.1 Physical
Cross-Linking Using Heat
Physical cross-linking of inulin/PVA
CNFs was performed by heating
the inulin/PVA CNFs at various temperatures (from 80 to 140 °C)
for 10 min. Then, the CNFs were immersed in warm distilled water at
37 °C for 2 and 24 h. Interestingly, the inulin/PVA electrospun
CNFs dissolved immediately, and the solution turned clear, once they
were immersed in water. On the other hand, the cross-linked inulin/PVA
CNFs shrunk and hardened but did not dissolve. Moreover, the water
stability improved where the weight loss % decreased as indicated
in Table 1 and Figure 6a.

Figure 6 (a) % weight loss of
physically crosslinked inulin/PVA electrospun
nanofibers after immersion in distilled water for 2 and 24 h. Different
heating temperatures were tested: (A) 80, (B) 100, (C) 120, and (D)
140 °C. (b) % weight loss of chemically crosslinked inulin/PVA

and (D) 120 min.

100	30	36	
120	28.7	34.1	
140	22.7	28.3	
By examining
the morphology of physically cross-linked inulin/PVA
CNFs at different temperatures from 80 to 140 °C, using SEM,
they appeared to be curved, and some fibers were merged together to
form bundles but still retained the fibrous structure as shown in Figure 7. These results were
found to be in agreement with the results reported by Kang et al.
(2010), in which the heat treatment of PVA nanofibers increased their
water resistance.

CNFs

2.3.2 Chemical Cross-Linking
Using Glutaraldehyde
Inulin/PVA CNFs were chemically cross-linked
by exposing the CNFs
to glutaraldehyde (GA) solution vapor at different exposure time intervals
(from 30 to 120 min). Following 2 and 24 h of immersion in warm distilled
water, the chemically cross-linked CNFs did not dissolve but they
shrunk and hardened. However, after chemical cross-linking of the
CNFs with GA, the water stability did not improve, as determined by
the unchanged weight loss before the chemical cross-linking as indicated
in Table 2 and Figure 6b.

Table 2 Weight Loss % of Chemically Cross-Linked
Inulin/PVA CNFs after Water Immersion
exposure time (min)	weight loss % (2 h)	weight loss % (24 h)	weight loss % (7 days)	weight loss % (14 days)	weight loss % (28 days)	
30	54.6	63.1	71.8	72.1	74.6	
60	51.2	60.7	65	67.2	70	
l90	49.7	58.1	63.4	64.5	69.4	
120	44.2	56	60	60.7	68.9	
Similar to the physical cross-linking, the chemically cross-linked
electrospun CNFs had a curved morphology, and bundles were formed
by the merged fibers while retaining the fibrous structure as shown
in Figure 8.

Figure 8 SEM images
of chemically cross-linked PVA/inulin electrospun CNFs
with different exposure durations: (a) 30, (b) 60, (c) 90, and (d)
120 min.

Comparing both cross-linking methods,
the water stability was improved
with the physical cross-linking and provided the optimal cross-linking
protocol for inulin/PVA CNFs. However, the chemical cross-linking
was not a feasible method, as the water stability of nanofibers did
not improve.

2.4 Microbiological Assessment
of Inulin/PVA CNFs
2.4.1 Prebiotic Activity
The prebiotic
activity of the electrospun CNFs was tested against Lactobacillus spp., and the colony forming units
(CFU) enumeration was recorded (Figure 9a). An increase in the total viable count following
24 h incubation with inulin/PVA CNFs, reaching 4 × 103 CFU/mL (3 × 103 CFU/mL for the control). However,
no increase in the viable count of inulin solution was observed (remained
at 2.9 × 103 CFU/mL). In addition, the pH and the
optical density (OD) of the culture inoculated with the tested materials
were measured before incubation and following 24 h incubation. The
results revealed that cultured inulin/PVA CNF solution showed a decrease
in pH to 5.7 compared to 6.3 for the control. However, the inulin
solution showed no decrease in the pH and remained at 6.2 (Figure 9b). Note that the
inulin/PVA CNFs recorded the highest OD reading, following 24 h incubation,
among the tested samples (Figure 9c).

Figure 9 (a) Total viable count, (b) pH, and (c) OD of Lactobacillus sp. culture containing PVA nanofibers,
inulin solution, inulin/PVA
CNFs, and water following 24 h incubation, and (d) growth curve of Lactobacillus sp. culture containing inulin/PVA CNFs.

It is likely that the pH of inulin/PVA CNFs decreased
because of
bacterial fermentation (Gibson & Roberfroid, 1995),29 and these findings are in agreement with the
results reported by Zubaidah and Akhadiana (2013),30 where inulin showed a decrease in the pH of fermented bacteria.
Also, there was an increase in the total viable count of the Lactobacillus sp., because of prebiotic activity
of the inulin. In Figure 7d, the growth curve showed that the growth of the culture
containing inulin/PVA CNFs is not substantially greater than the growth
of the control.

2.4.2 Antibacterial Activity
The antibacterial
activity of PVA/inulin nanofibers was evaluated by the disc diffusion
method and CFU method (in the Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2). The antimicrobial tests revealed zero activity
for pure PVA and high activity for inulin against Escherichia
coli. Inulin/PVA CNFs showed significant activity
against E. coli (Figure 10). However, both the pure
PVA and inulin had little activity against Staphylococcus
aureus, contrary to the inulin/PVA CNFs, which showed
moderate activity against S. aureus (Figure 10). The
antimicrobial activity of inulin and PVA/inulin nanofibers could be
because of the fructose units present in inulin, which have a natural
antibacterial property, resulting from fructose interference with
the physiology of the bacterial cell membranes and inability of the
bacteria to break it down. Although there was comparable results for
both pure inulin and PVA/inulin nanofibers, it is accepted that incorporation
of inulin in nanofibers greatly enhances the stability and thus enables
controlled release.

Figure 10 Antibacterial activity of PVA, inulin, PVA/inulin, and
vancomycin
against E. coli and S. aureus.

These results iterate the crucial role of the material shape in
bulk form versus nanoform on both prebiotic and antibacterial effects.
It is evident that one cannot ignore this fact when fabricating nanocoatings
and antibacterial scaffolds with superior properties.

3 Conclusions
In this study, electrospinning of inulin/PVA
composite solution
was carried out, and the prebiotic and antibacterial activities were
evaluated. A careful investigation to optimize the concentration of
the electrospun solutions, electrospinning applied voltage, and solution
flow rate was carried out. Inulin solution was not able to be directly
electrospun into uniform nanofibers at any concentration. However,
an improved spinning ability of inulin solutions was observed, upon
mixing inulin with the PVA polymer. In this regards, uniform electrospun
CNFs of inulin/PVA were successfully produced by electrospinning,
and fabricating inulin/PVA electrospun CNFs was successful.

After thorough investigation and characterization of the produced
inulin/PVA electrospun CNFs, the prebiotic and antibacterial activities
were assessed. The results of the prebiotic activity of the inulin/PVA
electrospun CNFs showed a 33% increase in the Lactobacillus sp. growth compared with inulin solution. Additionally, inulin/PVA
CNFs showed higher antibacterial activity with E. coli and S. aureus compared with inulin
solution. This clearly shows the unique antibacterial effect of the
nanoscale transformation of inulin solution versus inulin nanofibers
and their high application potentiality in diverse biomedical settings.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
PVA
(DP = 2800) and GA
solution (25 wt % in H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
Germany. Inulin from dahlia tubers was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
USA. Difco Luria Bertani (LB) agar medium and Difco LB broth medium
were purchased from Becton Dickinson Company, USA. The bacterial strains
used in this study are: S. aureus ATCC
6538, E. coli, ATCC 8739, and Lactobacillus sp. ATCC 33222.

4.2 Methods
As inulin is considered a
very interesting material to be tested and cannot be electrospun on
its own to form nanofibers, PVA was used in combination with inulin
to fabricate the required nanofibers. Both pure PVA and inulin/PVA
solutions in distilled water were prepared to be used for nanofiber
fabrication and testing of their physical and chemical properties
and microbiological activities. First different concentrations of
the solutions were prepared to examine the optimal one for electrospinning
experiments. Then, different types of crosslinking agents were applied
to the obtained CNFs to investigate their effects on the resulting
nanofiber stability. Finally, various electrospinning parameters including
applied voltage and solution flow rate were varied to achieve the
most uniform fibers with least bead formation.

4.2.1 Preparation
of PVA Nanofibers
Various
concentrations of PVA solutions (e.g., 15, 16, 18, and 20% w/w) were
prepared by dissolving the PVA in distilled water using a magnetic
stirrer at temperatures ≤100 °C for a period of less than
90 min to acquire a homogenous solution.

Each of the as-prepared
PVA solutions was electrospun into nanofibers using a commercial electrospinner
(E-Spin Tech, India) with a solution syringe pump and a high voltage
power supply (Gamma High Voltage power supply, USA). The solutions
were loaded into a plastic syringe connected to a sharp tip needle.
Electrospinning parameters were adjusted as follows: high voltages
between 16 and 20 kV and solution flow rates of 0.005–0.5 mL/min.
Aluminum foil sheets were used to cover the copper plate collector,
and the distance from the tip of the needle to the collector was adjusted
to 10 cm. Electrospinning of all solution mixtures was carried out
at room temperature. The preparation of PVA nanofibers is dependent
upon the parameters of the electrospinning, such as the solution concentration,
the solution flow rate, and applied voltage.

4.2.2 Preparation
of Inulin/PVA CNFs
The different concentrations of inulin/PVA
blend solutions were prepared
by adding 2–5% inulin in the form of aqueous solution to each
of the as-prepared PVA solutions mentioned previously and left to
stir until obtaining the required homogenous blended solution.

Each of the as-prepared solutions of inulin/PVA with different weight
blending ratios was electrospun into nanofibers using the same commercial
electrospinner with the same procedures used in the preparation of
the PVA nanofibers. The preparation of inulin/PVA CNFs is dependent
also on the parameters of the electrospinning, such as the solution
concentration, the solution flow rate, and the applied voltage.

4.2.3 Preparation of Cross-Linked Inulin/PVA CNFs
Physical and chemical cross-linking of the most acceptable inulin/PVA
CNFs was carried out to obtain the most reliable cross-linking method.
GA solution was used for chemical cross-linking of the inulin/PVA
CNFs. The CNFs were placed inside a closed desiccator occupied with
the vapors of 50 mL of GA solution. Exposure time to GA vapor varied from
30 to 120 min and was then thermally treated for 24 h in an oven at
70 °C under vacuum for enhancement of cross-linking and removal
of unreacted GA (Abdelgawad, Hudson, & Rojas, 2014). Physical
cross-linking was performed by thermal treatment of the inulin/PVA
CNFs in a vacuum oven (Jelotech, OV-11, and Korea) at temperatures
from 80 to 140 °C for 10 min (Kang et al., 2010).23

4.3 Analysis
4.3.1 Chemical Analysis
Chemical characterization
was carried out to obtain information about the chemical nature of
the materials as well as to determine the effect of blending them
into a composite to obtain useful information on the type of bonding
and functional group changes that are useful in their applications.
This test was done by FT-IR spectroscopy (Nicolet 380-Thermo Scientific,
USA). Condensed discs consisting of the material (powder/nanofibers)
and potassium bromide (KBr) were subjected to infrared radiation,
and absorption peaks were obtained. These peaks which gave characteristic
chemical details of the chemical composition of the material were
processed. Additionally, a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA Q50, TA
Instruments) was employed to reveal the thermal stability profiles
of the inulin/PVA CNFs in comparison with its starting materials in
order to study the thermal behavior resulted from the formulation
formed. To achieve this, few milligrams of each material were placed
in a platinum pan and tested under a 60 mL/min purge of nitrogen gas.
The samples were then heated up to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min.
UV–vis spectroscopy (Varian Cary 500, Agilent Technologies,
USA) was used to study the loading capacity and determine the percentage
of inulin in PVA nanofibers, following the procedure reported by Shetta
et al.35 Exploiting differences in solubility
with temperature PVA/inulin nanofibers were loaded into dialysis bags,
immersed in distilled water, and stirred at 400 rpm at room temperature
for 2 h. The resulting distilled water containing inulin, which dissolves
in water at room temperature, was analyzed using UV–vis spectroscopy.
The amount of inulin was estimated by the suitable calibration curve
of pure inulin in distilled water with an r2 of 0.995. The loading capacity was determined by eq 1. 1  

4.3.2 Morphological Analysis
Morphological
studies were carried out to determine the integrity of the fibers
being formed, their fiber diameter, bead formation, fiber alignment,
and length. This test was carried out by a scanning electron microscope
(FESEM, Leo Supra 55-Zeiss Inc., Germany). SEM samples were prepared
by cutting aluminum foil containing nanofibers into 0.5 cm2 and mounting them on stubs for SEM imaging.

4.3.3 Physical Analysis
Physical characterization
was carried out to determine the stability of nanofibers and the ability
to resist degradation by water or during processing and storage for
cross-linked nanofibers. Noncross-linked nanofibers are known to easily
disintegrate in solvents and may easily lose their integrity as a
result. This is minimized by crosslinking the nanofibers either by
chemical (GA) or physical (heat) means.

4.3.3.1 Water
Immersion Test
Nanofibers
were immersed in warm distilled water at 37 °C for 2 and 24 h.
Then, the CNFs were immediately weighed after removing the surface
water with a filter paper. The degree of weight loss of cross-linked
CNFs was calculated according to eq 2 (Yuan, Mo, Wang, Li, Zhang, & Shen, 2012).31 The weight before immersion in water (wi) and after immersion in water and drying (wf) was measured. 2  

4.3.4 Microbiological Assessment
Inulin,
as a natural food ingredient
(Niness, 1999), possesses prebiotic activity by balancing the bacterial
population in human gut health (Fotiadis, Stoidis, Spyropoulos, &
Zografos, 2008).32 The prebiotic activity
of the fabricated PVA/inulin CNFs was tested with Lactobacillus spp. The antibacterial activity of the fabricated CNFs was tested
against both S. aureus (Gram positive)
and E. coli (Gram negative). All the
experiments were carried out in triplicates. Inulin was weighed and
sterilized under a UV lamp at 365 nm for 30 min and then dissolved
in sterile distilled water. The previously prepared circular discs
of PVA and PVA/inulin CNFs were weighed individually. All of the weighed
CNFs were placed in sterile Petri dishes and left for 30 min under
a UV lamp at 365 nm (Berthomieu & Hienerwadel, 2009).33

4.3.4.1 Prebiotic Activity
The prebiotic
activity of inulin nanofibers was examined with Lactobacillus spp. (ATCC 33222) by measuring bacterial growth using total bacterial
viable count and OD of bacteria grown in liquid cultures, and any
pH changes were recorded. Individual bacterial strains were incubated
overnight in a shaking incubator at 37 °C after introducing a
single colony to fresh LB broth. Serial dilutions of the overnight
cultures were performed to attain dilution factors of 10–1 to 10–6. In brief, 1 mL of the culture was introduced
to 9 mL of fresh LB broth (Mandal, DebMandal, Pal, & Saha, 2010),34 and the test tubes were incubated with PVA nanofibers,
PVA/inulin CNFs, inulin solution, control, and water. Following 24
h incubation at 37 °C of the plated cells, the CFU were counted.
The total viable counts were carried out again for all tubes after
24 h incubation. Additionally, the OD and pH were measured at zero
and 24 h following incubation (Li, Q.; Jia, Z.; Yang, Y.; Wang, L.;
Guan, Z. ICSD ’07. IEEE International Conference on Solid Dielectrics,
2007).28

4.3.4.2 Antimicrobial
Assessment
The
CNFs were examined for their antibacterial activity against E. coli (ATCC 8739) and S. aureus (ATCC 6538) by the disc diffusion method. The cultured bacteria
were inoculated separately and after the agar solidification; plugs
were cut out with the cork-borer (10 mm diameter). The sterile CNF
discs were placed on the surface of seeded agar while solutions were
inoculated into the agar well. The plates were solidified at 4 °C
for 2 h and then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and the zones of
inhibition were measured.
