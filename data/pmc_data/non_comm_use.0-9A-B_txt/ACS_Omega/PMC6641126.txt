Considering
the absence of reports dealing with the perovskite-structured
orthochromites containing two A-site magnetic rare-earth ions, GdCrO3 and progressively Dy3+-substituted samples of
the series Gd1–xDyxCrO3 have been synthesized employing the
epoxide-mediated sol–gel procedure. The samples were characterized
extensively using high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction, thermal
analysis, Fourier transform infrared, Raman, and UV–visible
spectroscopies, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. Monophasic samples possessing
an orthorhombic perovskite structure emerged by calcining the xerogels
formed by the reaction of rare-earth nitrates, chromium(III)chloride,
and propylene oxide at 800 °C for 2 h. Uniform presence of wormlike
morphology was observed in both the field emission SEM (FE-SEM) and
TEM images of the samples. Zero-field and field-cooled magnetic measurements
using a SQUID magnetometer down to 4 K showed that the Neel temperature
of Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3 was 155 K, more
or less midway between the values observed for GdCrO3(169
K) and DyCrO3 (146 K). For the Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3 sample, a spin reorientation was observed at ∼38
K when measured under an applied field. Because the optical band gap,
determined by Kubelka–Munk function, of these chromites was
around 3 eV, their application as a catalyst for the photodegradation
of the aqueous rhodamine-6G dye solution was demonstrated, in which
the percentage of the total dye that was degraded varied with the
average ionic radius of A-site ions. A similar systematic trend was
observed even for the catalytic oxidation of the XO dye in the presence
of H2O2, with DyCrO3 influencing
the reaction to a greater extent followed by Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3 and GdCrO3. Both the photocatalytic
and catalytic reactions followed pseudo-first-order kinetics.

1 Introduction
Perovskite
structure with the general formula ABX3 is
very popular among solid-state chemists, condensed matter physicists,
and materials scientists and has been investigated extensively.1−3 The innumerable number of possibilities of substitutions at A and
B sites with ions of varying valence and ionic radii together with
the choice of anion from halide to oxide adore it to exhibit many
interesting properties such as high-temperature superconductivity,
piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity, multiferroism, colossal magneto
resistance, and catalytic functions.4−7 The recent demonstration of high solar cell
capability in organic–inorganic halo perovskites has added
a new dimension to the expanding list of multifunctions that one can
anticipate to be discovered.8,9 The multifunctional
character of rare-earth chromites (RECrO3) with a distorted
perovskite structure has invited extensive investigation by the research
community with special emphasis on the rare earths, influencing a
possible magneto-electric coupling.5,10−13 Essentially, three different magnetic spin interactions, Cr3+–Cr3+, Cr3+–RE3+, and RE3+–RE3+, with isotropic, symmetric,
and antisymmetric anisotropic exchange, respectively, exist in these
systems.14−18 The antiferromagnetic Neel temperature (TN) arising from Cr3+–Cr3+ interactions
has been found to increase with increase in the ionic radius of rare-earth
(RE3+), illustrating the influence of the A-site ion on
the ordering of B-site ions. A lot of deliberations have been found
to dominate the current literature, seeking the exact role of magnetic
RE3+ for the observed canted antiferromagnetism and polarization
in these systems.14−18 Studies dealing with sharing of the A-site with one magnetic ion
(such as Gd or Pr) and the other nonmagnetic ion (La or Y) are quite
common, whereas similar investigations with the A-site shared by magnetic
rare earths are limited.19−29 Also, in such studies, the effects of only a smaller concentration
of the second magnetic rare-earth ion (typically up to 10%) have been
focused. These studies employed the solid-state diffusion process
for preparing the samples.29

Given
the superiority of solution-based methods over the solid-state
reactions to efficiently cross the diffusion barrier rapidly at lower
temperatures,30−34 here we present the epoxide-mediated sol–gel method for the
generation of a continuous series of Gd1–xDyxCrO3 samples. Epoxide-mediated
sol–gel process has been demonstrated to be an alternate and
efficient synthetic method compared to other sol gel route such as
citrate sol gel or involving alkoxide.35 Further, it can be executed easily with high precision, beginning
with air-stable inorganic salts without the use of any intricate setups;
it will be a perfect method to study the solid solution of the type
Gd1–xDyxCrO3, wherein the metal ions from different blocks of
the periodic table with differing reactivities are present. Although
alkoxides of rare earths are commercially available, it is difficult
to control their rate of hydrolysis along with the hydrolyzable alkoxide
of chromium, which may lead to variation in the final stoichiometry.
Although a few studies state that gels could be formed only from GdCl3 and not from its nitrate salt, PrO2 has been successfully
synthesized employing praseodymium nitrate, demonstrating the complex
chemistry involved in the gelation of chemically equivalent metal
ions.36,37 These differences illustrate the requirement
of more studies employing the epoxide-based gel method so as to bring
out more clarity.

In the present study, GdCrO3, DyCrO3, and
a complete series of the solid solution between them have been synthesized
following the epoxide-mediated sol–gel method and have been
characterized extensively using an array of analytical techniques
including high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectroscopy, and magnetic measurements. Interesting
magnetic interactions and systematic variation of the catalytic efficiency
emerged in the series Gd1–xDyxCrO3 demonstrated the influence
of a second magnetic ion at the A-site to tailor its properties.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure, Morphology,
and Magnetic Properties
The intense green-colored xerogel
obtained from the reaction of
propylene oxide (PO) with the reactants was subjected to thermal analysis
experiments. The results from this experiment are presented in Figure 1. The gradual weight
loss with progressing temperature indicated the homogeneity of the
gels. Whereas the mass loss till 120 °C was due to the removal
of moisture and occluded water in the gels, the greater mass loss
after 120 °C and up to 400 °C could be attributed to the
decomposition of organic moiety from the gels. Both these steps were
exothermic in nature. Epoxide-mediated gels show exothermic events
for the observed mass losses in the differential thermal analysis
(DTA) because epoxide linkages are quite weak and prone to moderately
violent decomposition triggered by heat.39 Minimal weight loss beyond 750 °C with no observable thermal
events suggested that the samples can be calcined at temperatures
above this to obtain the mixed metal oxide. Pale green color powders
were obtained on heating these samples at 800 °C for 2 h in a
muffle furnace, followed by natural cooling to room temperature by
switching off the furnace. PXRD patterns of these samples indicated
the formation of the crystalline perovskite-structured oxide (Figure 2). Formation of any
other secondary phase such as Cr2O3 was not
observed, highlighting the homogeneous mixing and concurrent reaction
of the constituents. The observed reflections were indexed in an orthorhombic
symmetry, and successful Le Bail refinement of the PXRD pattern was
carried out in the Pnma space group using TOPAS3
software.38 The refined patterns and the
extracted lattice constants are provided in Figure S1 and Table 1, respectively. The subtle variation in the ionic sizes of Gd3+ and Dy3+ (VI coordination 0.930 and 0.912 Å,
respectively) because of the lanthanide contraction was evident from
the shift of all diffraction peaks toward the higher 2θ values
for the Dy-substituted samples as compared with GdCrO3 (Figure 2). All three lattice
constants of the orthorhombic unit cell showed a linear variation
with the increase in the concentration of Dy replacing Gd in the lattice,
as shown in Figure 3. This was in accordance with the Vegard’s law of the solid
solution of two constituents. The uniform presence of wormlike morphology
was observed in the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
images of GdCrO3, DyCrO3, and Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3 (Figure 4a–c). Apparently, this kind of morphology
is quite typical of samples synthesized either employing polyhydroxy
alcohol or through the formation of a metal hydroxide precursor, as
reported earlier in case of GdFeO3 and La0.5Sm0.5CrO3 samples.31,32,40 The wormlike morphology was also observed
for Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3 sample in its
TEM image (Figure 4d). From the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of this sample,
Gd/Dy/Cr was found to be in a ratio of 0.5:0.5:1, close to the starting
nominal composition (Figure 4e). This illustrated the effectiveness of this synthetic method
in minimizing the loss of any metal ions during processing and thus
aiding in the preservation of the nominal composition in the final
product. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectra of
GdCrO3, DyCrO3, and Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3 are presented in Figure 5a,b, respectively. In the FTIR spectra, band
present at around 430 cm–1 were due to the O–Cr–O
deformation vibrations. The peaks at around 480 and 660 cm–1 corresponded to the Ln–O and Cr–O stretching vibrations
(Figure 5a).41 As compared with the FTIR spectra, bands in
the Raman spectra are quite sensitive to the introduction of the second
rare-earth ion at the A-site.42,43 Following the group
theoretical predictions for an orthorhombic structure with Pnma space group with four formula units per unit cell,
24 vibration modes are Raman-active, namely, 7Ag + 5B1g + 7B2g + 5B3g are possible. Four different
types of distortions in the structure, namely, rotation of CrO6 octahedra, Jahn–Teller distortion, and shift of Ln
atom from its position, account for the appearance of Raman modes.
In the Raman spectra of GdCrO3, DyCrO3, and
Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3, a maximum of eight
modes were observed other than the band at around 830 cm–1 (Figure 5b). We did
not observe other bands because they were very weak to be observed
or at very low wave numbers below the current experimental cutoff.
The sharp and intense modes below 200 cm–1 arise
primarily from Ln-ion vibrations. With progressive substitution of
Dy for Gd, all of the observed modes, except a few, shifted their
positions to higher values as compared with the observed values for
GdCrO3. The two important modes A1g and B2g, arising from the distortion caused by the size of the rare-earth
ion on the CrO6 octahedra, at 550 and 325 cm–1 became sharp on the introduction of Dy for Gd in the structure,
confirming its inclusion at the crystallographic site. This was in
accordance with earlier reports, wherein the data in the range have
been provided up to 600 cm–1.12 The bands observed beyond this range have been reasoned
out to indicate the higher oxidation state of chromium in the samples.42,43 This was correlated with the oxidizing nature of epoxide as gelation
agent for the synthesis of these samples. Epoxide linkages are known
to cleave exothermically when heated, and the exothermic events observed
in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments of xerogels
of these samples suggest that smaller amounts of chromium in the structure
may be oxidized to higher states in addition to +3 during bulk synthesis.

In general, three types of magnetic interactions
dominate in rare-earth
orthochromites.14−18 Whereas the Cr–Cr interaction dominates in determining the
magnetic properties above 100 K, the Gd–Cr interaction defines
the magnetic properties below 100 K. The Gd–Gd interaction
results in ordering at around 2.3 K. At the Neel temperature, a paramagnetic
to antiferromagnetic phase transition can be observed, which is attributed
to the Cr3+–Cr3+ exchange. This is greatly
affected by the rare-earth ionic radius that can couple with the Cr3+ spin structure. The orientation of the rare-earth moments
with respect to Cr3+ spin depends upon the nature of the
effective magnetic field at the rare-earth site. Anisotropic magnetic
interactions between Ln3+ and Cr3+ ions are
known to result in spin reorientation. Such behavior is favorable
for inducing ferroelectric polarization. The temperature dependence
of the molar susceptibility of GdCrO3, DyCrO3, and Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3 from the SQUID
measurements carried out under zero field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled
(FC) conditions are presented in Figure 6. From the ZFC measurements, TN values for GdCrO3, DyCrO3, and
Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3 were extracted. Although
the TN values for GdCrO3 (169
K) and DyCrO3 (146 K) were close to the values reported
earlier,14−18 it was 155 K for the Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3 sample, suggesting its high homogeneity in terms of the presence
of two magnetic ions at the A-site. For GdCrO3, it can
be observed that magnetization becomes negative with the decrease
in the temperature. Such intriguing magnetic reversal behavior has
been reported earlier.31 GdCrO3 and DyCrO3 showed paramagnetic behavior at low temperatures
beyond TN. For the Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3 sample, a spin reorientation is observed
at ∼38 K in the FC measurements. Such a trend has been reported
earlier for SmCrO3 at 33 K.31 The observance of such spin reorientation highlighted the emergence
of interesting magnetic interaction induced by incorporating two different
magnetic ions at the A-site.

2.2 Optical, Catalytic, and
Photocatalytic Properties
The diffuse reflectance spectra
of GdCrO3, Gd0.9Dy0.1CrO3, Gd0.7Dy0.3CrO3, Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3,
Gd0.3Dy0.7CrO3, Gd0.1Dy0.9CrO3, and DyCrO3 and their absorbance
data in terms of Kubelka–Munk (K–M) function are presented
in Figures 7 and 8, respectively. In the UV–vis diffuse reflectance
data of GdCrO3 and DyCrO3, a sharp band at 274
nm was present, signifying the 8S7/2 → 6I11/2 transition of the Gd3+ ion. Other
maxima at 390, 800, and 901 nm were attributed to the transitions
from the ground state 6H15/2 to 4I13/2, 6F5/2, and 6F7/2 of the Dy3+ ion.34,44−47 Additionally, the DMSO-d6 transition
of Cr3+ was observed at 456 and 615 nm. The parity-forbidden
and spin-allowed transitions [4A2g (4F) to 4T2g, 4T1g (4F), and 2A2g → 2T1g, and 2A2g → 2E2g] of the
Cr3+ ion were observed at 691 and 730 nm, respectively.34,44−47 All of these bands were present in the progressively Dy-substituted
samples as well. The optical band gap of GdCrO3, Gd0.9Dy0.1CrO3, Gd0.7Dy0.3CrO3, Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3, Gd0.3Dy0.7CrO3, Gd0.1Dy0.9CrO3, and DyCrO3 (estimated
from the plot of K–M function as the absorption coefficient
and photon energy) was found to be 3.36 eV (for GdCrO3),
3.11 eV (for Gd0.9Dy0.1CrO3), 3.06
eV (for Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3), 3.03 eV
(for Gd0.3Dy0.7CrO3), 2.99 eV (for
Gd0.1Dy0.9CrO3), and 2.96 eV (for
DyCrO3). Although band gap value for DyCrO3 was
slightly above the reported value of 2.8 eV (for nanoplates),47 the decreasing trend of the band gap with the
substitution of rare earth of smaller size matched well with the literature.46

and Gd0.1Dy0.9CrO3 samples using
the K–M function.

As the observed band gap values fell in the range of wide
band
gap semiconductors, it prompted us to investigate their role as catalysts
for the degradation of aqueous rhodamine (Rh)-6G dye solution in presence
of visible radiation. Additionally, their catalytic role for the oxidative
degradation of the XO dye solution with H2O2 was examined.48,49 The results from the photocatalytic
degradation of Rh-6G dye under visible light with varying durations
of irradiation are presented in Figures 9 and S2. From
the plots of C/C0 versus
the irradiation time, it was observed that the percentage of Rh-6G
dye degraded by about 70, 75, 78, 84, and 90% in the presence of GdCrO3, Gd0.7Dy0.3CrO3, Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3, Gd0.3Dy0.7CrO3, and DyCrO3 samples, respectively,
within 60 min. Assuming pseudo-first-order, the rate constants for
these reactions were estimated to be 2.6 × 10–2, 3.52 × 10–2, 4.28 × 10–2, 6.24 × 10–2, and 8.12 × 10–2 min–1. This is exactly reverse to the trend observed
in case of rare-earth orthoferrites.50 One
of the possible reasons could be the existence of a narrow window
of band gap in orthoferrites consisting of rare-earth ions of differing
ionic radii compared with the reasonably wide window of band gap in
rare-earth orthochromites. Lattice distortion has also been found
to play a significant role in enhancing the photocatalytic property
of oxide systems because it could provide additional route to trapping
of holes and eventually decrease the recombination rate of electron–hole
pairs. Although in perovskite oxides the valence and conduction bands
are made up of 3d orbitals of B-ion and 2p orbitals of oxygen, the
sensitivity shown in the present case of orthochromites suggested
the active participation of the valence electronic structures of A-cations.
Whereas Gd3+ has half occupation of f-orbital situation,
its dilution with more than half-filled Dy3+ alters its
band gap and catalytic activity. The oxidative degradation of the
aqueous solution of the XO dye employing H2O2 as the oxidant and the synthesized samples as catalysts revealed
that the degradation of XO was indeed very sluggish in the absence
of a catalyst even after 45 min of reaction, as indicated by the slight
decrease in the intensity of λmax at 434 nm (Figures 10 and S3). Increasing the amount of H2O2 did not alter the kinetics. However, a drastic reduction
in the intensity of absorption peak was observed within 5 min after
the addition of 30 mg of GdCrO3, Gd0.7Dy0.3CrO3, Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3, Gd0.3Dy0.7CrO3, and DyCrO3 samples. The solution became completely colorless within
20 min, suggesting the catalytic role of the sample. To quantify this
oxidation reaction, C/C0 was calculated after generating a linear calibration curve (a straight
line) using the absorbance values of standard solutions of XO with
different concentrations. The concentration of XO in the presence
of a catalyst was then determined by fixing the absorbance versus
the concentration graph. From the C/C0 plot with the reaction time, it can be seen that 76.8,
87.3, 90.0, 92.4, and 94.0% of XO degraded within 20 min of reaction
in the presence of GdCrO3, Gd0.7Dy0.3CrO3, Gd0.5Dy0.5CrO3,
Gd0.3Dy0.7CrO3, and DyCrO3 samples, respectively. The amount of degradation of XO varied systematically
with the dilution of Gd with Dy, illustrating chemical reactivity
change brought about by A-site mixing of magnetic ions. To the best
of our knowledge, this trend has been reported for the first time
in rare-earth orthochromites. Assuming the reaction to follow pseudo-first-order
kinetics, the rate constants for these reactions were estimated to
be 4.80 × 10–2, 5.66 × 10–2, 8.62 × 10–2, 9.3 × 10–2, and 11.66 × 10–2 min–1.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the epoxide-mediated
gel synthetic approach has been
successfully demonstrated for the generation of perovskite-structured
GdCrO3, DyCrO3, and the entire set of A-site
shared by both the magnetic rare-earth ions from air-stable inorganic
salts. The presence of another magnetic ion (next neighbor in the
periodic table) at the A-site altered the TN arising from the Cr3+–Cr3+ interaction.
The observance of such spin reorientation highlighted the emergence
of an interesting magnetic interaction induced by incorporating two
different magnetic ions at the A-site. As the optical band gap of
GdCrO3 and progressively Dy-substituted samples was in
the visible range of the spectrum, they were demonstrated to degrade
the aqueous Rh-6G dye solution efficiently in the presence of visible
radiation, within which a systematic trend of increased efficiency
corresponding to the change in the ionic radius was observed. A similar
observation was made even when the samples were used as catalysts
for the oxidative degradation of XO. These results validated the fact
that not only the magnetic properties but also the catalytic and photocatalytic
functions of these systems can be fine-tuned just by altering the
A-site magnetic rare-earth ion. There appears to be an intrinsic cooperative
effect between Cr3+ and Ln3+, affecting the
catalytic properties of these systems. In our view, this can add another
dimension to the host of multifunctions exhibited by orthochromites.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis
Gd2O3 (Alfa Aesar 99%), Dy2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich 99.9%),
CrCl3·6H2O (99.5% CDH), absolute alcohol
(Merck), and PO (Alfa Aesar) were used as purchased for the experiments.
Gd2O3 (0.362 g, 1 mmol) and Dy2O3 (0.372 g, 1 mmol) were separately digested in a minimum amount
of nitric acid to prepare the respective metal nitrate salts in situ.
For the synthesis of xerogel, 0.266 g (1 mmol) of CrCl3·6H2O dissolved in absolute methanol was mixed with
both the nitrate solutions, followed by the addition of 1.4 mL (20
mmol) of PO slowly under stirring. The mixture was sonicated for nearly
2 min, after which a green-colored thick gel formed immediately. For
the synthesis of Gd1–xDyxCrO3, the following amounts of rare-earth
oxides together with 0.266 g (1 mmol) of CrCl3·6H2O were used: Gd2O3 (0.3256 g, 0.9 mmol)
and Dy2O3 (0.0372 g, 0.1 mmol), Gd2O3 (0.2534 g, 0.7 mmol) and Dy2O3 (0.116 g, 0.3 mmol), Gd2O3 (0.181 g, 0.5 mmol)
and Dy2O3 (0.186 g, 0.5 mmol), Gd2O3 (0.108 g, 0.3 mmol) and Dy2O3 (0.2604 g, 0.7 mmol), and Gd2O3 (0.0362 g,
0.1 mmol) and Dy2O3 (0.3348 g, 0.9 mmol). The
gels were obtained in a way exactly similar to the one described for
GdCrO3.

4.2 Characterization
PXRD patterns were
recorded using a PANanalytical X’Pert diffractometer equipped
with a PIXcel3D detector employing Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5418 Å) with a scan rate of 58.39 s/step and a step
size of 0.01313° over the range of 2θ = 10–70°
at 25 °C. The PXRD patterns were fitted using the Le Bail method
to obtain the cell dimensions using TOPAS3 software.38 The FTIR spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer 2000
FTIR spectrometer using KBr disks. The Raman spectrum was recorded
using a Renishaw spectrometer via a microscope system operating with
an Ar+ laser (λ = 488 nm). UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra of the samples in a solid form were recorded using
a UV–vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 35) equipped
with an integrating sphere. BaSO4 was employed as the reference.
Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of xerogels was carried out on a NETZSCH
STA-449 F3 instrument in the temperature range of 30–800 °C
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. FE-SEM micrograph and EDX analysis
of the sample were performed using Hitachi S-3700M and JEOL 660LV
microscopes, respectively. TEM analysis was carried out using an FEI
Technai G2 20 electron microscope operating at 200 kV.
Magnetic measurements of the powder samples were carried out using
a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (MPMS XL
Ever Cool) between 4 and 300 K.

4.3 Catalytic
Experimental Details
Photocatalytic
degradation was carried out in an immersion type, in-house fabricated
reactor under visible radiation employing a mercury vapor lamp with
125 W power (Philips, India). Thirty milligrams of the catalyst was
added to 50 mL of the aqueous dye solution of the dye Rh-6G with an
initial concentration of 10 × 10–6 mol/L at
room temperature. Prior to irradiation, the suspension containing
the catalyst and the dye solution was stirred in the dark for 40 min
so as to attain equilibrium adsorption. After shining the solution with the visible radiation, 5–6 mL of aliquots
was taken out from the reaction mixture periodically and centrifuged.
Thirty milligrams of the catalyst was added to 20 mL (100 × 10–6 mol/L) of XO solution and 10 mL of H2O2. The concentration of the solutions was determined by measuring
the absorbance at λmax = 542 nm (for Rh-6G) and 434
nm (for XO) using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 1800).
