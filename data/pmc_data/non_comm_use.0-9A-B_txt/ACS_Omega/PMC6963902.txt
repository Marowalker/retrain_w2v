In this mini-review, we summarize the solution syntheses
of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)-protected
metal
nanoparticles (NPs) and nanoclusters (NCs) and their use in catalytic
reactions. Representative examples are given of external-stabilizer/protectant-free
metal NP and NC syntheses by reduction with DMF. In this method, DMF
has three roles, i.e., a solvent, reductant, and protectant. Recent
applications of DMF-stabilized metal NPs are summarized. These applications
have enabled a versatile organic transformation such as cross-coupling
reactions, hydrosilylation, and methylation to be achieved. These
reactions proceed under low catalyst loadings and ligandless conditions.

1 Introduction
Metal nanoparticles (>100
nm) and nanoclusters (<2 nm) (M NPs
and NCs) have attracted significant interest as catalysts. The pioneering
work conducted by Haruta, which enabled low-temperature Au NP-catalyzed
CO oxidations, has had a significant impact on nanocatalysis.1 Because of their high surface to volume ratios,
nanocatalysts have high catalytic activities. The use of M NPs as
catalysts in organic transformations has greatly expanded because
of their activity, selectivity, and recyclability. In recent studies
by Jin and our group, atomically precise thiolate-ligand-protected
Au NCs [Aun(SR)m] were used to catalyze reactions such as CO oxidation, alkyne
semihydrogenation, and C–C coupling reactions2 and to synthesize propargylamines from amines, aldehydes,
and alkynes; these are referred to as A3 coupling reactions3 and hydroaminations.4 Tsukuda’s group5 used poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)-stabilized Au NCs to catalyze
hydroaminations and alcohol oxidations.

In general, M NPs and
M NCs are synthesized from metal precursors
by reduction in the presence of stabilizers in the liquid phase, i.e.,
the bottom-up method (Scheme 1a). The bottom-up approach has been used to access a variety
of M NPs with a size-controlled NP core in the presence of surface
stabilizers. However, stabilizers such as thiolate and phosphine surfactants
and polymers are needed to avoid undesired aggregation, which hampers
access to catalytically active surface sites.6 Surfactant-free synthesis provides a simple way to provide maximum
access to catalytically active sites. Surfactant-free means preparation
in the absence of added stabilizing agents. Such NPs are stabilized
by solvents or the ions of reducing agents or salts. In catalytic
applications of NPs, capping molecules act as stabilizers and also
affect the catalytic performance because of charge transfer between
the metal and stabilizer. The relationship between surface properties
and catalytic behavior is attracting considerable research interest
because of its potential importance in enabling new organic transformations
to be achieved. In this mini-review, we highlight recent advances
in the synthesis of external-surfactant-free N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)-stabilized M NPs and NCs (Scheme 1b) and their use
in versatile catalytic systems.

2 General Mechanism of Synthesis of DMF-Stabilized
Metal Nanoparticles
DMF is a well-known useful solvent in
organic chemistry.7 Because of its structure,
the use of DMF has
been explored in a wide range of applications, e.g., as a reagent
in colloidal synthesis. Because of the high oxidation potential of
DMF (1.9 V vs SHE),8 it can reduce metal
salts and form NPs in the solution phase.9 In the early studies of DMF-based reduction of metal precursors
and nanocrystal synthesis, Liz-Marzán and co-workers used PVP
as a capping agent.10 To date, surfactant-free
metal nanoparticles have been reported by using ethylene glycol and
methyl isobutyl ketone as reductant. In contrast, the DMF-reduction
method generated thermally stable M NPs/NCs with narrow size distribution
(<7 nm).9 The proposed reduction mechanism
is shown in eq 1; carbamic
acid is readily oxidized to CO2 and (CH3)2NH.8,9 In other reduction pathways, formic acid
generated from DMF decomposition serves as a reductant for the metal
precursor, and CO or H2 reduces metal ions (eq 1). 1  

DMF also acts as a protectant in surfactant-free
synthesis. Surfactant-free
Au NPs were first synthesized by Li and co-workers as fluorescent
quantum dots.10 Since 2011, Kawasaki and
our group have reported external-surfactant- and stabilizer-free syntheses
of various M NPs and their use as organic transformation catalysts.11 These metal NPs are stable in moisture and air,
and the catalytic reactions under rigorous inert atmosphere conditions
are not a prerequisite. Previously reported data are summarized in Table 1.

3 DMF-Stabilized Metal Nanoparticles and Nanoclusters
for Organic Transformations
3.1 Gold
Kawasaki and co-workers investigated
the catalytic activities and specific properties of Au NPs.12 The DMF-stabilized Au NCs consisted on average
of 13 Au atom clusters. FT-IR and 1H NMR spectroscopic
investigations showed a strongly coordinated DMF layer around the
Au NCs. These DMF-stabilized Au NCs catalyzed reduction of 4-nitrophenol
to 4-aminophenol by NaBH4 (eq 3). An induction time (∼3000 s) was observed,
which indicates that the DMF layer hindered access to the catalytically
active site. Thermally aged Au NCs had a shorter induction time (∼100
s at 80 °C for 8 h). 3  

Lang et al. reported DMF-stabilized
Au NPs of three different sizes (1.0, 2.5, and 5.5 nm).13 The solution temperature and nucleation time
were used to control the particle size. The catalytic activities of
these three Au NPs in the Ullmann homocoupling reaction were evaluated
(eq 4). 4  

The order of the catalytic activities
was Au (2.5 nm) > Au (<1
nm) > Au (5.5 nm). These Au NPs were stable. They were recycled
fewer
than three times, and their catalytic activity gradually decreased.

3.2 Palladium
DMF-stabilized Pd NCs were
synthesized from PdCl2. We reported the synthesis and cross-coupling
catalytic activities of DMF-protected Pd NCs. The Pd NCs showed high
catalytic activities in the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling and
Mizoroki–Heck reactions (eqs 5 and 6).14 High turnover numbers (TONs) were achieved, i.e., 4.5 ×
105 and 6.0 × 108. The DMF-stabilized Pd
NCs showed higher TONs than the precedent polymer micelles stabilized
by Pd NPs up to 2.8 × 105. The DMF-stabilized Pd NCs
were recyclable. The Pd NCs were separated from the substrates and
products by simple extraction with hexane/DMF (Scheme 2). The Pd NCs were recycled at least five
times without significant loss of activity. 5  

Scheme 2 Procedure for Recycling Pd NCs
In 2013, DMF-stabilized Pd NCs were used to
catalyze the Migita–Kosugi–Stille
coupling reaction (eq 7).15 Reactions of aryl halides with tributylphenyl-/tributyl-vinylstannane
gave the corresponding cross-coupling products. The Pd NCs were stable
in air and gave high TONs (up to 3.5 × 104). 7  

Recently, we reported cross-coupling
of aryl halides with hydrosilanes/disilanes
(eqs 8 and 9).16 Generally, silylations require
relatively high catalyst loadings.17 The
coupling reaction proceeded under phosphorus-ligand- and external-additive-free
conditions. The DMF-stabilized Pd NCs can be recycled five times under
hydrosilane/disilane reaction conditions. The catalyst recycling procedure
is similar to that for Suzuki–Miyaura cross-couplings. XPS
analysis showed displacement of DMF molecules surrounding the metal
center to N,N-dimethylacetamide.
DMF dissociation improved the catalytic performance. 8  

Indole derivatives are key motifs
in many bioactive compounds.
The reaction of 2-haloanilines with alkynes, namely, the Larock indole
synthesis, is a useful method for accessing indole motifs. DMF-stabilized
Pd NCs successfully catalyzed the synthesis of 2,3-disubstituted indoles
from 2-iodoanilines and internal alkynes under external-ligand-free
conditions at low catalyst loadings (0.3 mol %) (eq 10).18 The Pd NC catalyst can be reused at least three times. 10  

Sanda and our group achieved Sonagashira–Hagihara
(eq 11) and Mizoroki–Heck
coupling (eq 12) polymerization by using DMF-stabilized
Pd NCs as the catalyst.19 11  

The catalytic reaction provided poly(phenyleneethynylene)s
and
poly(phenylenevinylene) of moderate molecular weights (Mn 6700 and 5900). These results are similar to those achieved
with conventional PdCl2(PPh3)2 and
Pd(PPh3)4 complex catalysts. The ligand-free
Pd NC polymerization system avoids contamination of the growing polymer
by ligand-derived phosphorus impurities.

3.3 Copper
DMF-stabilized Cu NPs were
prepared from CuCl2. The particle size was determined by
HRTEM and DLS (2–7 nm). The catalytic activity in Ullmann-type
cross-coupling of aryl halides with phenol derivatives under ligand-free
conditions was evaluated (eq 13);20 the reaction of iodobenzene
(1.5 mmol) with 3,5-dimethyphenol (1.0 mmol) was used as a model reaction.
When this reaction was performed in the presence of DMF-protected
Cu NPs (0.2 mol %) and Cs2CO3 (2.0 mmol) in
DMF at 110 °C for 24 h under Ar, the corresponding product was
obtained in 92% yield. The DMF-stabilized Cu NPs showed high catalytic
activity (TONs up to 2.2 × 104). The Cu NPs can be
reused three times. 13  

The Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling
reaction is a powerful tool for obtaining acetylenes. The DMF-stabilized
Cu NPs showed high catalytic activity in this reaction (eq 14).21 In a typical procedure, a mixture of iodobenzene (0.5 mmol), phenylacetylene
(0.75 mmol), and PPh3 (10 mol %) in DMF (1 mL) was heated
at 135 °C for 24 h in the presence of DMF-stabilized Cu NPs (0.2
mol %). The corresponding product was obtained in 96% yield. The presence
of PPh3 or bipyridine (bpy) was necessary for this reaction.
TEM observations showed that the Cu NPs retained their single-nanosized
structure after the catalytic reaction. The DMF-stabilized Cu NPs
are themselves inactive, but they act as a catalyst precursor when
PPh3 and bpy are used as additives. Some of the DMF dissociates
from the Cu NPs and in situ generated PPh3-stabilized Cu
NPs catalyze the Sonogashira cross-coupling. 14  

3.4 Iron
Iron oxide NPs were prepared
from Fe(acac)3 under open-air conditions. The DMF-stabilized
Fe NPs were characterized by XANES and XPS. The Fe NPs were identified
as α-Fe2O3. The Fe2O3 NPs were efficient catalysts in hydrosilylation of alkenes (eq 15).22 In a typical reaction, 1-decene and phenylsilane were reacted
in the presence of DMF-stabilized Fe2O3 NPs
at 70 °C for 24 h to give the corresponding hydrosilylation products
in 84% yield. Various alkenes and primary/secondary hydrosilanes were
used under these conditions, and the corresponding hydrosilylation
products were obtained in moderate to good yields. Alkenes with various
functional groups were tolerated in this reaction (Scheme 3). The Fe2O3 NPs were recycled multiple times. Catalyst preactivation
was not needed prior to their reuse. The catalyst particle size and
photoluminescence characteristics were retained before and after the
reaction. Therefore, the Fe2O3 NPs can be recycled
at least five times without loss of considerable catalytic activity. 15

Hydrosilylation

3.5 Iridium
DMF-stabilized Ir NCs were
prepared from IrCl3. The particle diameter was determined
to be 1–1.5 nm from HR-TEM images. Ir complexes are generally
efficient catalysts in alkylations with alcohols, which involve a
hydrogen-borrowing reaction.23 In particular,
methylation is a widely used modification in medicinal chemistry.
Methylation uses hazardous reagents, e.g., (CH3O)2SO4 and MeI. Methylation using methanol as the C1 source
is a challenging transformation. However, methanol oxidation requires
harsh conditions. DMF-stabilized Ir NCs showed high catalytic activity
in promoter-free methylation of anilines by alcohols.24 In a typical procedure, the reaction of 1-phenyl-1-ethanol
with methanol (2 mL) in the presence of Ir NCs (0.1 mol %) and Cs2CO3 gave the desired dimethylated product in 94%
yield with high alcohol selectivity (eq 16). Iridium complexes, [Cp*IrCl2]2 and [IrCl(cod)]2, known to be efficient
catalysts for α-methylation resulted in the product in low yields
under these conditions (25% and 21%, respectively). Monomethylation
at the β-carbon (eq 17) and N-alkylation of anilines (eq 18)
were achieved under modified conditions. The DMF-stabilized Ir NCs
have high catalytic activity in N-methylation. A
high TON was achieved for N-methylation of anilines
(up to 310 000). 16  

4 Conclusions and Outlook
We have reported
the solution syntheses of a series of DMF-stabilized
M NPs/NCs and their use as catalysts in various organic transformations.
In these syntheses, DMF served as a stabilizer, reductant, and solvent.
In the DMF-stabilized M NPs and NCs, the DMF molecules surrounded
the surface of the metal center. A possible mechanism of high catalytic
performance of metal NPs is attributed to the generation of open sites
by heat-assisted liberation of the DMF molecules that may act as an
active catalyst in the organic reactions. The DMF-stabilized M NPs/NCs
are as thermally stable (>100 °C) as thiolate-stabilized M
NCs.
Stabilizers such as thiolates and phosphines strongly covered the
active site on the metal clusters, which led to a decrease in their
catalytic activity. In contrast, the DMF-stabilized M NPs/NCs generate
partially catalytically active open sites by liberation of DMF molecules.
The resulting M NPs were stable for a long time, which hampered aggregation
during catalytic reactions.

The DMF-stabilized M NPs showed
high catalytic activities (TONs
and selectivities). Partial liberation of DMF molecules from the surfaces
of the M NPs opened active sites to serve as the active catalyst in
various organic transformations such as cross-coupling reactions,
hydrogen borrowing reactions, and alkene hydrosilylation reactions.
In addition, the use of M NPs enabled catalyst recycling in various
reaction systems by using liquid–liquid extraction. Finally,
control of the M NP properties (shape, size, and capping state) will
provide new and specific reactivities. Innovative transformations
could be achieved by alloying NPs (e.g., Pd–Cu)25 to modify the catalytic properties of M NPs.
Heteroatom doping can control and improve catalytic activities, as
has been shown by photoluminescence properties. Further advances in
combining M NPs and NCs will play a key role in future progress in
organic chemistry. We hope that this mini-review will inspire readers
to explore further applications of stable, practical, and highly active
catalytic DMF-stabilized M NPs in organic chemistry.
