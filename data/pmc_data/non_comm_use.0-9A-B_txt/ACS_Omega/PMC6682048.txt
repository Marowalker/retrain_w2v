Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) has been utilized for
rapid analysis of uranyl ions (UO22+) on account
of its fast response and high sensitivity. However, the difficulty
of fabricating a suitable SERS substrate for in situ analysis of uranyl
ions severely restricts its practical application. Hence, we proposed
flexible and adhesive SERS tape decorated with silver nanorod (AgNR)
arrays for in situ detection of UO22+. The SERS
tape was fabricated through a simple “paste & peel off”
procedure by transferring the slanted AgNR arrays from silicon to
the transparent tape surface. UO22+ can be easily
in situ detected by placing the AgNR SERS tape into an aqueous solution
or pasting it onto the solid matrix surface due to the excellent transparent
feature of the tape. The proposed SERS tape with well-distributed
AgNRs effectively improved the reproducibility and sensitivity for
UO22+ analysis. UO22+ with
concentration as low as 100 nM was easily detected. Besides, UO22+ adsorbed on an iron disc and rock surface also
can be rapidly in situ detected. With its simplicity and convenience,
the AgNR SERS tape-based SERS technique offers a promising approach
for environmental monitoring and nuclear accident emergency detection.

Introduction
Uranium (19.2 g/cm3), as one of the key components in
nuclear resources, exhibits essential employments in the nuclear industry
and weapons.1 Operation of nuclear power
stations, nuclear tests, nuclear accidents, and uranium mining have
caused considerable uranium-related pollutions upon its release into
the environment, which brings long-term health threats to human beings.2,3 The uranyl ion (UO22+) is the most common
and thermodynamically stable form of uranium in the natural water
environment. It is highly toxic, migratory, and may very easily harm
body organs. Thus, rapid analysis of trace UO22+ in the environment has become an attractive issue, especially for
nuclear emergency detection when nuclear accidents happen.

Many
analytical methods have been developed for UO22+ detection such as electrochemical methods,4 fluorescence spectroscopy,5 UV–vis
adsorption spectrometry,6 ICP mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS),7 inductively coupled plasma atomic
emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES),8 and so
on. Despite providing concentration information, those methods lack
the capability of enforcing in situ analysis or require time-consuming
sample preparation, sophisticated equipment, expert operators, and
high cost, limiting their practical applications. Particularly, the
sample transportation with radioactivity from the on-site to the laboratory
may create security risks and change the sample status where the analytical
results cannot truly reflect the sample features. Therefore, it is
of great urgency to develop a simple analytic technique available
for in situ and real-time monitoring of UO22+.

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is able to detect
chemical
components with single-molecule sensitivity through their characteristic
vibrational fingerprint spectra.9 The high
sensitivity mainly originates from electromagnetic enhancement (EM)
produced by the noble metallic nanoparticles due to their localized
surface plasmonic resonance effect.10,11 The SERS technique
has unique core competence for rapid and trace analysis of chemicals
on account of its high sensitivity, fast signal response, and no sample
pretreatment. In SERS experiments, SERS substrates are the key and
indispensable component.12−14 An excellent SERS substrate should
have the features of good stability, sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility,
and molecular generality.15 Many efforts
have been made for SERS detection of UO22+ by
fabricating various SERS-active nanostructures, such as silver nanoparticles,16−18 modified silver nanoparticles,19,20 silver-doped
sol–gel films,21 silver nanorods22 or coated silver nanorods,23 gold nanoparticles,24 and so
on. Bhandari et al.25 fabricated silver
nanoparticles by vapor deposition on polypropylene filters for UO22+ analysis with an LOD of 58 nM. Leverette et
al.22 even detected 10 nM uranyl ions by
utilizing aligned Ag nanorod SERS substrates. Although some achievements
have been made for SERS analysis of UO22+, it
is difficult to detect uranyl ions adsorbed on solid surfaces. Most
importantly, the in situ detection is still quite deficient. The reason
is that the SERS substrates developed for UO22+ detection are rigid and opaque to light. Thus, developing a transparent,
flexible, adhesive, and homogeneous SERS substrate with high density
of SERS “hot spots” may be the key to solving the above
problem.

In this study, flexible and adhesive SERS tape decorated
with silver
nanorod (AgNR) arrays was utilized as the SERS substrate for in situ
detection of UO22+. The SERS tape was fabricated
by transferring the slanted AgNR arrays from silicon to the transparent
tape surface through a simple “paste & peel off”
procedure. Compared with those flexible SERS substrates reported recently,
such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS),26 adhesive
tape,27 and paper28 decorated with gold/silver nanoparticles where the morphology of
SERS-active nanostructures is usually hardly controlled, the SERS
tape proposed here has homogeneous nanostructures with high density.
What is more, the excellent transparency of the tape used here and
2D nanostructures arrays make nondestructive in situ detection possible.
UO22+ was in situ analyzed by placing the AgNR
SERS tape into an aqueous solution or pasting it onto solid matrixes
such as an iron disc or a rock surface. The whole fabrication, storage,
and utilization process of the SERS tape is very simple and convenient.
The results demonstrate that the AgNR SERS tape-based SERS technique
plays a crucial part in the nuclear accident emergency response process.

Results
and Discussions
Fabrication of the AgNR SERS Tape and Feasibility
for in Situ
Detection of UO22+
The fabrication
and analysis process of the AgNR SERS tape is illustrated in Scheme 1. Adhesive tape is
widely used in our daily life, such as encapsulating boxes, fastening
daily goods, and removing wrong characters from paper by the “paste
& peel off” procedure. Here, we used the transparent adhesive
tape to transfer the AgNR arrays deposited on the silicon substrate
through the analogous “paste & peel off” process.
Then, we placed the AgNR SERS tape on the analyzed solution where
UO22+ would be absorbed on the AgNRs due to
their strong interaction.25 Thus, UO22+ can be rapidly in situ detected by this simple
method.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of the AgNR SERS Tape Fabrication and
in Situ
Detection of Uranyl Ions in Aqueous Solution
To investigate the feasibility of the proposed strategy
for UO22+ detection, the SERS signal was collected
by
placing the SERS tape onto a 10–3 M uranyl nitrate
aqueous solution, and the results are shown in Figure 1. There is no SERS signal for water. However,
a strong, relatively broad, and asymmetric band was obtained centered
at 730–790 cm–1 for the uranyl solution,
which is attributed to the υ1 symmetric stretch of
the uranyl ion. As we can see, the normal O=U=O Raman
band of the uranyl nitrate is located at 870 cm–1. The very large shift of the uranyl peak can be explained by the
strong charge transfer from the silver to the equatorial plane of
the absorbed UO22+, weakening the axial U=O
bond intensity, which were also reported in the literature.16,19,25,29 The broad SERS peak of UO22+ with uncertain
peak values implies that the interaction between UO22+ and silver is complicated, and there may be several hydrolyzed
uranyl complexes absorbed on the silver surface, several interaction
modes between them, or both simultaneously. The charge transfer mechanism
between them needs further study. Interestingly, Wang et al.30 reported a photoinduced charge transfer enhancement
mechanism in the uranyl–Ag2O complex system where
the peak centered at 715 cm–1 is assigned to the
UO2+ band produced by the reduction of UO22+ through accepting one e–.
All in all, the result demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed
method for in situ detection of uranyl ions in aqueous solution.

ions in aqueous solution: (a) normal Raman spectrum of solid uranyl
nitrate, (b) SERS of the water showing no signal, and (c) SERS of
the 10–3 M uranyl nitrate aqueous solution showing

Morphology Characterization of the AgNR SERS
Tape
Figure 2 shows the typical
SEM images of the AgNR substrate and AgNR SERS tape. It is difficult
to deposit homogeneous SERS-active nanostructures with high density
of “hot spots” on the flexible substrates, while it
is rather easier to do on the rigid silicon surface. The slanted nanorods
are well separated and homogeneously distributed on the silicon by
the oblique angle deposition method (Figure 2a–c). The thickness of the nanostructures
is ∼245 nm with the length of a single nanorod approximately
600 nm. This AgNR array substrate exhibits excellent SERS performance.23,31−33 After being transferred by the transparent adhesive
tape through the “paste & peel off” method, the
nanorod structure of the SERS tape is still maintained and is dense
(Figure 2d,e), which
results in the high density of “hot spots”. Thus, the
flexible AgNR SERS tape with homogeneous SERS-active nanostructures
is easily constructed by this method. The ultrathin 2D nanostructures
and the excellent transparency of the tape material make the in situ
analysis of the AgNR SERS tape possible. We know that the AgNRs are
easy to oxidize or easily adsorb some impure molecules when placed
in air,34,35 increasing the storage cost of the rigid
AgNR substrate. However, the transparent tape can isolate the AgNRs
to prevent them from making direct contact with air for more than
1 month as long as we do not peel off the AgNR SERS tape from the
silicon when it is not used (see Figure S1), greatly improving the convenience of storage.

image of AgNR SERS tape, and (e) high-resolution SEM image of (d).

Analytical Performance
of the AgNR SERS Tape for UO22+
To
investigate the performance of the AgNR
SERS tape for UO22+ analysis, we measured the
uranyl nitrate solutions with different concentrations, as shown in Figure 3. The band intensity
for the symmetric stretching band of UO22+ remained
the same as the concentration was above 10–5 M,
demonstrating the saturated adsorption of UO22+ on the SERS tape. Also, the peak intensity varies with respect to
the logarithm of the concentration of aqueous uranyl solution from
10–5 M to 10–7 M (Figure 3b). The detection limit (LOD)
for uranyl ions is 100 nM. Table S1 lists
the comprehensive comparison results of the proposed SERS tape-based
method with others reported in the literature.22,25,36−38 The LOD of our proposed
SERS method is better than those of photometry (500 nM)36 and SERS based on modified gold nanoparticles
(800 nM),37 showing good sensitivity. The
sensitivity is lower than those obtained based on DNAzyme (2 pM)38 or rigid silver nanorod substrates (10 nM),22 while the advantages such as simplicity, rapidness,
and in situ function make it a forceful competitor in nuclear emergence
detection.

SERS tape. (b) Intensity variation of the uranyl ion symmetric stretching
band (centered at 730–780 cm–1, subtracted
with the blank signal) with respect to the logarithm value of its
concentration.

The apparent enhancement
factor (EF) of the AgNR SERS tape for
uranyl ions was also calculated from the difference of the UO22+ peak intensity between the SERS and the normal
Raman spectra of the uranyl ion solution. The background signal intensity
of the AgNR SERS tape was subtracted. The intensity was obtained according
to the peak area by using the self-contained calculation programs
of the Raman software. The EF value was obtained as the following
formula39  where I, N, T, and P represent the band intensity,
the number of absorbed analytes, the exposure time, and the laser
power, respectively. Here, we used their concentration to take the
place of the number of UO22+ by making the experimental
condition the same, that is, 0.05 M uranyl nitrate solution for Raman
and 10–6 M for SERS measurements, as shown in Figure 4. The calculated
EF for the SERS analysis of uranyl nitrate reaches up to 1.3 ×
106. The EF value is comparable with those of previously
reported ex situ methods (10–5 for Ag2O aggregates,30 3 × 105 for silver nanoparticle@rGO composites,19 and 1.02 × 106 for AgNR@HfO2 substrates34).

uranyl nitrate solution.
The exposure time is 10 s for Raman and 1 s for SERS.

To further evaluate the selectivity of the proposed
AgNR SERS tape-based
SERS strategy for UO22+ analysis, a series of
contrast experiments were performed including metals such as Na+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+, and the results are
shown in Figure 5.
These metal ion impurities did not cause the signal enhancement, indicating
good selectivity. To test the reproducibility of the proposed strategy
for uranyl detection, SERS measurements were performed for five different
samples at five different positions on each sample. The relative standard
deviations (RSDs) are 7.2 and 6.4%, respectively, showing good reproducibility.

Analysis of UO22+ in Tap Water
To
investigate the validity of the proposed AgNR SERS tape-based
SERS strategy to environmental samples, a solution of 10–5 M uranyl ions was added into the tap water sample. The measurement
result is shown in Figure 6. The strong SERS signal for the symmetric stretching band
of UO22+ was observed. This result indicates
that our proposed approach has great potential for rapid in situ analysis
of uranyl ions in the environmental samples.

Analysis of UO22+ Absorbed on the Solid
Matrix Surfaces
Uranyl ions are distributed not only in the
solution but also on the solid matrix surface under certain conditions.40,41 For example, the instruments or mechanical equipment running in
radioactive working places will inevitably adsorb uranyl compounds
when they are engage in nuclear-related works or nuclear accidents
happen, causing health hazard to the workers. Thus, in situ monitoring
of the uranyl ion absorbed on these surfaces is significant and meaningful.
Solvent extraction- or solid collection-based SERS methods cannot
meet the practical need of rapid and real-time monitoring. Hence,
we evaluated the application possibility of the AgNR SERS tape for
in situ detection of UO22+ from the iron discs.
The as-prepared uranyl nitrate solution (10 μL) was spread on
the iron disc and dried naturally in air. The SERS spectra were collected
by pasting the AgNR tape onto the iron disc surface and pressing the
SERS tape with a certain pressure for 4 s, as shown in Figure 7a. The iron disc shows no normal
Raman signal and neither in SERS. However, a strong main band centered
at 726 cm–1 for the 1 mM uranyl nitrate spread on
the iron disc was observed, which is assigned to the symmetric stretching
of UO22+ bonding on silver. This very large
shift indicates that a plasmon-mediated chemical reaction process
may happen, resulting in the reduction of UO22+ to UO2+ with the catalysis of plasmonic silver
nanorods.30 Since uranyl species adsorbed
on the iron disc have multilayers, there are only electromagnetic
enhancements for those UO22+ without direct
contact with silver nanorods. Thus, the shoulder peak at 812 cm–1 might be assigned to the UO22+ peak of the EM mechanism. This shift of wavenumbers may be mainly
attributed to the contribution of hydrolyzed uranyl complexes.42 The concentration of UO22+ down to 0.1 mM on the iron disc can easily be in situ detected using
the AgNR SERS tape. What is more, radioactive nuclides migrate with
the water and are adsorbed on the soil and rock surface when nuclear
accidents happen. To show the surface generality, the SERS spectra
of UO22+ from different surfaces, such as the
rocks, were also collected using the SERS tape. The Raman bands of
1 mM UO22+ are clear and can be easily identified
(Figure 7b), demonstrating
that the proposed AgNR tape-based SERS strategy can be utilized for
the qualitative detection of uranyl ions from various actual surfaces.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated the AgNR arrays SERS
tape-based SERS strategy
for the rapid in situ analysis of uranyl ions from actual environments.
The adhesive SERS tape decorated with AgNR arrays was fabricated via
a simple “paste & peel off” procedure. The uranyl
ion in aqueous solution was detected with the LOD of 100 nM. The uranyl
ion adsorbed on the iron disc and rock surface is easily detected
by pasting the SERS tape on the surfaces. Given the availability of
portable Raman spectrometers, uranyl ions can be rapidly and timely
analyzed on site with this simple way. It is expected that the AgNR
SERS tape-based SERS technique will play the key role in nuclear accident
emergency response and environmental monitoring.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Materials
Uranyl nitrate hexahydrate
(UO2(NO3)2·6H2O)
was bought from the China National Nuclear Corp. (Lanzhou, China).
It was dissolved in ultrapure water to make a 10–2 M stock solution and then diluted to the final concentration before
use. The adhesive transparent biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP)
tape was purchased from the local supermarket. The iron discs were
obtained from the laboratory, and the rocks were from the local environment;
they were washed three times with ultrapure water before use. All
reagents were used without further purification. Milli-Q-grade water
(conductivity >18.0 MΩ cm) was used throughout the experiments.

Fabrication of AgNR SERS Tape
Slanted AgNR arrays were
fabricated on the silicon substrate via the oblique angle deposition
(OAD) method.31 The electron-beam system
(GLAD, Thermionics Inc.) was used as the reaction cavity. The background
vacuum level was approximately 10–5 Pa. The incident
angle of the vapor flux was set at ∼86° off the Si, and
the deposition rate was set at 0.75 nm/s. When the thickness of nanostructures
reached 1000 nm as read using a quartz crystal microbalance, the deposition
process was stopped. To prevent the AgNR substrate from oxidizing
and adsorbing other impurities, the transparent adhesive tape was
pasted on the AgNRs as soon as it was prepared. The AgNR SERS tape
was fabricated by peeling off the tape carefully from the AgNR substrate
via using the strong adhesive force of the tape. Raman measurements
were conducted by placing or pasting the SERS tape onto the appointed
positions.

In Situ SERS Detection of UO22+ by the
AgNR SERS Tape
For detection of UO22+ in aqueous solutions, the AgNR SERS tape was peeled off from the
Si surface, cut into an area of ∼0.3 × 0.3 cm2, and placed onto the solution immediately. The Raman signal was
collected using a Raman spectrometer. For detection of UO22+ adsorbed on the solid iron disc and rock surface, 5
μL of the uranyl nitrate solution was dispersed onto the solid
surface, and the AgNR SERS tape was pasted on the surface for Raman
measurements. Due to the adhesion feature of the AgNR SERS tape, it
will tightly touch the surface, producing excellent sensitivity.

Characterization and Raman Measurements
A field emission
scanning electron microscope (ZEISS, MERLIN Compact) was used to obtain
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. All the SERS measurements
were done on a LabRam Xplora confocal Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin
Yvon). The laser excitation used in the experiment was 532 nm. The
laser powers are approximately 12.5 mW for in situ SERS analysis of
UO22+ in the aqueous solution with a collection
time of 1 s and 0.25 mW on the iron disc and rock surface with a collection
time of 10 s. The Raman scattering signal was collected with a numerical
aperture (NA) microscope objective from Olympus (50×, NA = 0.5).
