Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be found in different shapes and
sizes, which determine their chemical and physical characteristics.
Physical and chemical properties of metallic NPs can be tuned by changing
their shape, size, and surface chemistry; therefore, this has led
to their use in a wide variety of applications in many industrial
and academic sectors. One of the features of metallic NPs is their
ability to act as optothermal energy converters, where they absorb
light at a specific wavelength and heat up their local nanosurfaces.
This feature has been used in many applications where metallic NPs
get coupled with thermally responsive systems to trigger an optical
response. In this study, we synthesized AuNPs that are spherical in
shape with an average diameter of 20.07 nm. This work assessed simultaneously
theoretical and experimental techniques to evaluate the different
factors that affect heat generation at the surface of AuNPs when exposed
to a specific light wavelength. The results indicated that laser power,
concentration of AuNPs, time × laser power interaction, and time
illumination, were the most important factors that contributed to
the temperature change exhibited in the AuNPs solution. We report
a regression model that allows predicting heat generation and temperature
changes with residual standard errors of less than 4%. These results
are highly relevant in the future design and development of applications
where metallic NPs are incorporated into systems to induce a temperature
change triggered by light exposure.

1 Introduction
Nanotechnology is an interdisciplinary scientific field which involves
designing and manipulating atoms and molecules to form extremely small
structures.1 Some examples of these structures
are nanoparticles (NPs) which have gained extensive use in different
fields such as computer science,2 electronics,3,4 chemistry,5 biotechnology,6−8 and medicine.9−14 Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are among the most commonly used NPs
because of their unique physical and chemical properties, particularly
their lack of toxicity to biological systems, which allows them to
be compatible to be incorporated into diverse systems in the food
industry, cosmetics, optics, and biomaterial production.15 One of the most utilized properties of AuNPs
is their capability of converting optical energy of specific wavelengths
into thermal energy.

The ability of metallic NPs to convert absorbed light into heat
is due to the surface plasmon resonance exhibited only when the metal
is at the nanoscale. The NPs present electron–phonon and phonon–phonon
interactions, and part of the high-energy excited plasmon can decay
via a nonradiative process, leading to the release of thermal energy.
Ultimately, this thermal energy produced causes an increase in the
temperature of the surroundings of the nanostructure that diffuses
away from the surface of the hot metallic NPs. This effect happening
globally in a homogenous NP solution leads to an elevation in the
temperature of the bulk solution harboring the NPs.16−20 This physical property of the nanostructures has
led to their applications in cancer imaging,21 cancer cell ablation,22 spectroscopic
detection,23 photothermal therapy,24 and gene silencing.25

In each one of these applications, depending on the desired conditions
and aims, two forms of laser light [pulsed and continuous wave (CW)]
have been used to supply optical energy at a specific wavelength.
In spite of heat production required at the mentioned applications,
the lack of quantification in the heat generation in most of these
applications has led to methodological and experimental difficulties
in the operative procedure and additional applications to be developed.
Although, until now, both theoretical and experimental approaches
are used for evaluating and measuring photothermal heat generation
from the surface of the AuNPs, there have not been any regression
models developed to decipher the factors that affect heat generation,
which would lead to the ability of simulating optothermal energy conversion
in surfaces of nanostructures. Therefore, in this work, we have experimentally
measured the heat generation in AuNPs that have been exposed to continuous
LASER illumination and have analyzed the experimental results based
on a statistical method to further develop a mathematical model that
allows predicting AuNP heat generation and temperature changes in
the system. Furthermore, we statistically evaluated the effect of
different important factors such as laser power (consequently power
intensity), illumination time, AuNP concentration in an aqueous solution,
and their interactions. This led to the development of an accurate
mathematical equation that predicts the amount of heat generation
in a AuNP solution after being exposed to laser light.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 AuNPs Characterization
The initial
characterization of the AuNPs was done by UV–visible absorption
spectroscopy. For metallic NPs, absorption wavelengths in the range
of 300–800 nm are normally used for their characterization.26 However, the UV–vis spectra of the reaction
sample were recorded instantly after the synthesis, and the spectra
are shown in Figure 1a. As can be seen, the maximum absorbance of the synthesized AuNPs
is at 521.6 nm, which corresponds to the results obtained in the literature
for AuNPs.27−29

plasmon absorption of AuNPs with a maximum absorbance at 521.6 nm.
(b) TEM image of the synthesized AuNPs and (c) SEM image of the synthesized
AuNPs.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) were used for the size and morphological analysis of the synthesized
AuNPs. As can be seen from Figure 1b,c, the synthesized particles are mostly spherical
and homogenous in size.

Furthermore, a dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis showed that
the average mean size of the AuNPs was 31.25 nm (Figure 2a), while the particle size
distribution analysis driven from the analysis of NPs present in the
TEM images showed that the average size of the AuNPs was around 20.07
nm (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 Characterization of synthesized AuNPs. (a) DLS analysis of synthesized
AuNPs. (b) Particle size distribution driven from TEM images.

Results showed that more than 73% of the synthesized AuNPs (Figure 2b) are similar in
size (between 15 and 25 nm) and homogenous. This particle size difference
between the analysis of NPs from TEM images and DLS average size measurement
is related to the broad distribution formed by mixing two particles
in the DLS measurement.30 Furthermore,
Zhang et al.31 have reported that the average
size of NPs obtained from DLS is usually larger than the analysis
with TEM, and it is attributed to the influence of Brownian motion
of the particles in solution.

The surface scan spectra demonstrated the presence of Au and C
atoms according to their binding energies. The most prominent signal
in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum is the Au 4f
consisting of two spin–orbit components at 83.18 and 86.78
eV (Figure 3a).32,33 In the XPS survey spectrum of the sample surface (Figure 3b), in addition to peaks of
Au, photoelectron and Auger peaks of C, O, and Na are detected. Carbon
and oxygen are from the sample exposure to normal atmosphere, and
Na is from the precursor used in the synthesis. The high-resolution
spectrum of Au confirms that the NPs are in their elemental state.

potential of synthesized AuNPs.

Figure 3c shows
the zeta potential measurement of the synthesized AuNPs (with concentration
of 88 μg/mL) by the citrate method (no buffer was used in this
measurement). The results showed that the zeta potential value is
−39.4 mV, which demonstrates that the synthesized AuNPs are
considered to be strongly anionic which resulted from using citrate
as a capping agent. Moreover, the results show that these NPs have
high stability in solution.34

2.2 Effect of AuNP Concentration, Illumination
Time, and Laser Power on Temperature Changes of an Aqueous AuNP Colloid
In order to decipher the effective variables affecting temperature
increase in a AuNP aqueous colloid, a Pareto analysis was used, taking
into account three factors and their interactions. In this case, a
reference line exists in the chart that indicates statistical significance
of a factor. Indeed, bars that cross this reference line are considered
to be statistically significant.

The Pareto chart in Figure 4 shows that the main
effect of all factors was significant at a level of 0.05. In addition
to the mentioned effects, the effect of time × laser power was
the only significant interaction effect observed.

Figure 4 Pareto chart showing the main effects of the various factors and
their interaction on the temperature change of the colloidal AuNPs.

Next, in order to investigate how the variables affect the response
and what was the relationship between the variables and their response,
a regression analysis was performed. We applied the significant factor
identified from the Pareto interpretations, and the relationships
were identified between temperature, as a response or dependent variable,
and significant factor, as independent variables. The regression model
in terms of the coded factors in the form of a linear equation is
described as follows 1  where x1, x2, x3, and y represent the concentration of AuNPs solution, time illumination
of laser light, laser power, and temperature change, respectively.

ANOVA was also used in the model analysis, and the results can
be observed in Table 1. The ANOVA analysis was performed to compare the effect of a significant
factor by the parameter variance and an F-test. Statistically,
whenever the F value in ANOVA is bigger, the regression
coefficient will be bigger in the equation, and consequently, the
factor will be more significant and efficacious in response. According
to this, it can be observed that the laser power was the most effective
factor in a temperature change response in the AuNP colloid because
it had the largest coefficient in the model. The effectiveness of
laser power in the temperature changes of AuNPs can also be theoretically
confirmed from a physics aspect. The theoretical calculations show
that the maximum temperature at the surface of a small enough AuNP
(where retardation effects can be ignored) is obtained as follows35 2  where RNP and c is the radius of AuNPs and velocity of light, respectively,
omega is the frequency of the incident light, K0 is the thermal conductivity of the solution, ε(r) is the local dielectric constant, ε0 is the dielectric constant of the solution, and ε(ω)
is the frequency-dependent dielectric constant of AuNP. I0 is the intensity of the LASER beam directly proportional
to the LASER power. This equation shows that the temperature of single
AuNPs increases linearly with light intensity.

a P-values less than

In addition to the laser power, concentration of AuNPs solution
was the next most effective variable triggering a temperature change
in the bulk solution. The concentration effect can be explained theoretically
by considering the physics of ensemble heating. For an ensemble of
AuNPs with concentration c, the total volumetric
heat flux Q generated by all NPs can be approximated
as 3  where σabs is the absorption
cross-section of single AuNPs. As can be seen, the heat (and so the
temperature) is linearly proportional to the concentration. However,
LASER light is attenuated in the solution according to the Beer–Lambert
law. The characteristic time of NP cooling for the size of our structures
is of the order of picosecond to nanosecond.36 Furthermore time inversely depends on the surrounding medium heat
diffusion constant. High diffusion of the surrounding medium (here
water) makes this time very short. Consequently, the temperature increase
over the solution along the LASER path would be uniform when it comes
to time intervals in the order of minutes. The LASER intensity in
the solution is exponentially decreased with a decay constant of τ
= c·σabs. Considering these
two facts indicates that although increasing AuNPs concentration results
in a linear increase of the total heat, the intensity is attenuated
along with the solution with a higher number of AuNPs.37

Finally, the other factors including time × laser-power interaction
and time illumination were the next most effective variables in triggering
a temperature change response, therefore exhibiting the next biggest
coefficient value in the equation.

It should be noted that the positive sign of all significant regression
coefficients implied that all the terms had a direct relationship
with AuNP temperature change. It indicated that the mean of the dependent
factor tended to increase or decrease when the value of each independent
variable increased or decreased, consequently. Therefore, more temperature
changes and more intensity in the photothermal phenomenon of the AuNPs
solution were due to increasing values of each independent variable.

Likewise, the ANOVA regression results showed a statistical significance
of the applied model and the lack of fit was investigated by an F-test. Together, these results depicted that the obtained
linear model was highly significant (p-value <
0.0001) and a lack of fit showed no significance (p-value > 0.05).

Furthermore, both the correlation coefficient value (95.16%) and
adjusted R2 (94.15%), which indicate the
correlation between the model and experimental data, had a large enough
value. In other words, they were close to a value of 100% which corresponds
to a highly acceptable fit to a linear model from experimental data.

In order to validate the obtained regression model, predicted values
of ΔT were obtained based on an uncoded regression
model (Table 2). Then,
the average of experimental data was compared to predicted values
by calculating the RSE % (eq 4). The results of RSE % showed that the difference between
experimental and predicted values were no significant (RSE values
were lower than 4). However, there was a very good fit between the
linear model and the experimental data. Hence, the model can be used
to determine ΔT with good accuracy and precision
in the range of the values of the factors.

It should be highlighted that when water, as a negative control,
was exposed to the laser light, there was not a distinguishable change
in temperature. This means that all of the increased temperatures
shown in the AuNPs colloids were triggered by the optical properties
of the AuNPs.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, we designed an experiment based on a plasmonic photothermal
heating feature observed in AuNPs. These optical properties allow
the AuNPs to heat up their surroundings and have applications in diverse
systems, including biomaterial production and gene silencing.

In this manuscript, after the synthesis and characterization of
AuNPs, we experimentally measured the heat generation of AuNPs under
CW LASER illumination and made a temperature profile. Based on a statistical
evaluation, we identified different crucial factors that are effective
in temperature change of AuNPs solution. Our results indicated that
the laser power, concentration of AuNPs, time × laser power interaction,
and time illumination, were the most effective in achieving temperature
changes of AuNPs colloids. Further, we applied the significant variables
to present a regression model in order to predict the heat generation
amount from the same AuNPs surface. This model was chosen according
to the F test, lack-of-fit-test, and was adjusted
with the R2 value. The RSE % values observed
from our model were lower than 4%, demonstrating that the model accurately
describes ΔT of AuNP colloids within the range
of the values of the factors. In addition, these results were confirmed
and justified theoretically. The results and model reported in this
work will aid research in the development of systems that incorporate
localized heating through the exposure of specific wavelengths.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Gold trichloride ≥99.99%
trace metals basis (AuCl3) and trisodium citrate dihydrate
(Na3C6H5O7·2H2O) were purchased from Merck. Deionized water was used in
all experiments. A UV–vis spectrophotometer (LMAI-1-ES-3) from
Thermo Spectronic, professional multimeter RMS, and a continue wave
green laser (Quantum, model excel+mpc6000) with a peak wavelength
of 532 nm and beam size of 1.48 mm were used.

4.2 Synthesis of AuNPs
To synthesize
AuNPs, the Turkevich et al.38 method using
a citrate reduction was used.39 Aqueous
gold chloride solution (0.5 mM) (300 mL) was prepared in a beaker
and was boiled on heated stirred plate until boil. As soon as boiling
was observed, 30 mL of an aqueous 38.8 mM trisodium citrate solution
was added to the beaker and immediately after adding the trisodium
citrate solution, the colorless solution first turned dark violet-red
followed by a maroon color. Finally, the synthesized AuNP solution
was brought to room temperature to cool down, and the maroon color
solution slowly turned ruby red in color.

4.3 Characterization of the Obtained AuNPs
Among the different techniques to characterize NPs, UV–vis
spectroscopy,31 zeta potential analysis,
and transmission electron microscope are the most common. The UV–vis
spectroscopy technique is a very useful, applicable, and reliable
method for the primary characterization of synthesized AuNPs. Therefore,
the optical absorption spectra of colloidal AuNPs were measured using
this technique. TEM and SEM were also used for the characterization
of the AuNPs to determine their shape and morphology. DLS was used
to determine the size of the synthesized gold particles and estimate
the particle size distribution profile.

XPS was carried out
to investigate the elemental composition and chemical states of the
synthesized NPs. We used a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS instrument.
Finally, we used a Zetasizer (Nano ZS90 model) to determine stability
of the AuNPs in solution.

4.4 Setup of the Laser to Determine the Temperature
Profile Measurements
To obtain a complete temperature profile,
a CW green laser (532 nm wavelength) was employed to expose an aqueous
homogeneous dispersion of AuNPs (Figure 5). Suspensions (200 μL) of AuNPs were
loaded in a semimicro UV-cuvette (cat. no. 7591 50) and were directly
illuminated with the CW green laser. Moreover, deionized water as
a control experiment in the same volume (200 μL) was loaded
in the same cuvette and was also illuminated by the CW green laser
(532 nm wavelength). The temperature was measured before and after
laser illumination using a professional RMS Digital Multimeter sensitive
sensor, and then, the temperature changes between the initial and
final illumination time were recorded.

Figure 5 Experimental setup for measuring the temperature profile of AuNP
solutions.

4.5 Statistical Analysis
The experimental
design was carried out using the MINITAB statistical software version
18, and it was based on a full factorial design. Factorial designs
are preferred over the traditional one factor designs when involving
a time method because they offer better estimates on the effect of
each factor, and it allows the easy estimate of the interactive effect
between the factors, therefore offering more experimental information
using fewer resources (i.e., time, material).

In this study,
the design included three separate factors at several levels, and
they were performed in triplicates. The factors included the CW laser
with two different powers (100 and 300 mW), two AuNP aqueous concentrations
(the AuNP concentration were calculated by stoichiometries calculations
and checked with an online NP conversion calculator (www.nanocomposix.com)) at
44 and 88 μg/mL; and finally another factor tested at two levels
was the exposure time (10 and 20 min).

In order to identify the effective variables that induced a temperature
change in the AuNPs solution, the Pareto analysis was used. In order
to illustrate how these factors affect the temperature change registered
in the AuNPs solution, a regression model was developed, and the related
analysis was done. All of the experiments were analyzed at a 95% confidence
interval using the MINITAB statistical software.

In addition, in order to investigate the regression model performance,
five random tests were performed in three replicates and the residual
standard error percentage (RSE %) was calculated (eq 4) as follows40 4
