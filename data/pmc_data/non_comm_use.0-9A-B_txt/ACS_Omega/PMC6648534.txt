The quest for sustainable development
and green chemistry had led
to the design and synthesis of advanced adsorbent materials for efficient
removal of pollutants in industrial effluents. Magnetic halloysite
nanotubes with chitosan nanocomposite sponges were prepared by combining
solution-mixing and freeze-drying. Magnetic@chitosan/halloysite (Fe3O4–HNT/CS) and spongelike chitosan/halloysite
(HNT/CS) were used as adsorbents for the removal of Congo red dye
in aqueous solution in a batch process. The as-prepared composites
were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction, vibrating-sample magnetometry,
thermal gravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy. Data from kinetic study were analyzed
with pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models, whereas the
mechanism was analyzed using Bangham’s, Elovich’s, intraparticle,
and double-exponential diffusion models. The equilibrium data were
evaluated using Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich
isotherm models. The adsorption kinetics of dye removal followed the
pseudo-first-order model with average rate constants of 0.260 and
0.196 min–1 for Fe3O4–HNT/CS
and HNT/CS, respectively. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm best fitted
the equilibrium data with R2 > 0.9
with
maximum adsorption capacities of 41.54 and 54.49 mg g–1 obtained for HNT/CS and Fe3O4–HNT/CS,
respectively. Negative values of ΔG° obtained
from thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption process was
spontaneous. The values of ΔH° and ΔS° obtained for Congo red dye removal were 69.46 and
39.54 kJ mol–1 and 240.5 and 145.1 J mol–1 K–1 for HNT/CS and Fe3O4–HNT/CS, respectively. The results indicated that CS–HNT
is an excellent adsorbent; however, its magnetic modification further
improved its recyclability and enhanced the performance for the removal
of Congo red dye from aqueous solution.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Industrial and domestic
processes require water that is free from
colors and related compounds. On the contrary, however, effluents
from industries such as textile, paper and pulp, dye and dye intermediates,
pharmaceutical, tannery, craft bleaching, food technology, hair coloring,
rubber, paper, plastic, cosmetics, etc. contain dyes, organic colorants,
and phenolic compounds.1 These industries
consume majority of tens of thousands of chemically different types
of dyes that are currently manufactured.2 When untreated effluents from these industries are released in aquatic
environment, development of aquatic animals and plants is inhibited
because of outright blocking of sunlight, resulting in reduced photosynthesis,
increased biological oxygen demand, and reduced dissolved oxygen to
sustain the aquatic life. Furthermore, these pollutants exhibit toxic
effects on microbial and aquatic populations and become toxic and
carcinogenic to mammals when they enter the food chain.3

The first contaminants to be recognized
in wastewater effluents
are colorants, and the presence of a synthetic dye in water even in
a very small amount (<1.0 mg L–1) is typically
highly visible, affecting the aesthetic merit and transparency of
the water bodies. The complex structure and synthetic origin of dyes
made their removal through conventional wastewater treatment a colossal
task. Moreover, they are designed to resist breakdown with time and
defy exposure to harsh conditions such as sunlight, water, soap, and
oxidizing agents, thus making their removal challenging during wastewater
treatment. The Congo red (CR) dye is a sodium salt of 3,3′-([1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diyl)bis(4-aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic
acid), and it is the first synthetic dye produced with a complex chemical
structure and capability of dying cotton directly;4 hence, its application in a wide field of industrial processes
involve dyeing. Unfortunately, it metabolized to benzidine, a compound
implicated as a carcinogenic and a mutagenic agent,5,6 therefore,
exposure to this dye posed a potential danger of bioaccumulation and
allergy.

Various methods including physical, chemical, physicochemical,
and biological methods have been developed for the removal of dye
and other contaminants from wastewater. Adsorption has been the most
common physicochemical treatment method with potential applications
because of its low cost, effectiveness, and efficiency. Mostly, activated
carbon has been widely accepted in commercial systems as an adsorbent
for the removal of the contaminants in wastewater including dyes because
of its significant adsorption capacity; nevertheless, its high capital
cost, complicated synthesis process, low capacity, slow kinetics property,
and the harmful byproducts of the treatment process are major setback
for using activated carbon.7−9

The quest for sustainable
development and green chemistry had led
to the design and synthesis of advanced adsorbent materials for efficient
adsorption, separation, and purification. These include natural or
synthetic zeolite,10 organically modified
porous silica,11 natural or modified clays,12 macroporous polymeric adsorbents,13 and so on. However, high costs in terms of operation
and consumption time, low selectivity, limited adsorption capacities,
and difficulties in their regeneration and reuse are major challenges
for such materials. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical
significance to develop high-performance, low-cost, and recyclable
adsorbents.

Significant attention had also been paid to polymer–clay
nanocomposites, which are low-cost, environment-friendly, and abundant
materials with good chemical, mechanical, and structural stability.14,15 Most clays have cationic exchange capacity, thereby limiting their
applications to cationic pollutants; therefore, functionalization
is envisaged to confer enhanced performance. Halloysite (HNT), an
aluminosilicate clay with a hollow nanotube structure, has been used
as a nanocomposite, as a catalyst, in molecular hydrogen storage,
and as an adsorbent because of the presence of hydroxyl groups and
large pore volume and surface area.14 Chitosan
is a biopolymer derived from chitin, an abundant precursor, by deacetylation.
Its richness in hydroxyl and amino functional groups makes it one
of the substances that had been most exploited in the field of adsorption
of substances.16 Its use has been limited
by its pH sensitivity and low mechanical properties; hence, for practical
operations, these properties require improvement to increase the adsorption
capability of chitosan.17 The introduction
of clay into the polymer structure increases not only the adsorption
capacity of the adsorbent but also the mechanical and thermal stability,
thereby resulting in an adsorbent with superior properties compared
to those of either the clay or the polymer; nevertheless, the difficulty
encountered from separation of the suspended polymer–clay composite
after use is a big challenge. This challenge can be circumvented by
incorporation of iron oxide nanoparticles into the clay–polymer
moiety, thereby creating adsorbents with magnetic properties that
significantly impact the adsorption process on the surface with accelerated
separation and improved efficiency of water treatment.18 Although various reports on the use of the HNT/CS
composite are available in the literature, the inclusion of magnetic
particles is less reported.

This study reports the synthesis
and characterization of a biopolymer-grafted,
magnetically tuned halloysite composite (Fe3O4–HNT/CS) and its unmagnetized precursor. Their performances
as adsorbents for the removal of Congo red dye were also investigated.
The effects of the initial concentration of dye, contact time, pH,
and adsorbent dosage on Congo red dye removal as well as recyclability
were reported. Kinetic and equilibrium data as well as thermodynamics
data from the batch adsorption studies were analyzed with appropriate
models and reported.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the Adsorbent
The surface morphologies
of CS, HNT/CS, and Fe3O4–HNT/CS were
observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
presented in Figure 1. It is clear from the figure that the presence of HNT modified the
surface morphology of the CS (Figure 1a). The rough surface of the chitosan becomes more
collapsed, and the uniformly smooth surface is gradually transformed
to three-dimensional morphologies as HNT and Fe3O4 were incorporated into the composite.

Figure 1 SEM images of (a) CS,
(b) HNT/CS, (c) Fe3O4–HNT/CS, and (d)
Fe3O4–HNT/CS
after adsorption.

Energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) analysis of CS, HNT/CS, and Fe3O4–HNT/CS
is shown in Figure 2. The presence of O and C in chitosan was
revealed by Figure 2a and the incorporation of HNT was confirmed by the presence of Al
Na and Si in Figure 2b, whereas the presence of Fe in Figure 2c affirmed the incorporation of magnetic
particles into the structure of Fe3O4–HNT/CS.

Figure 2 EDX analysis
of (a) CS, (b) HNT/CS, and (c) Fe3O4–HNT/CS.

The decomposition process of CS/HNT
and Fe3O4–CS/HNT could be described in
three main steps as shown by
the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) curves in Figure 3a,b. The weight loss in TGA curves of CS/HNT
is shown at around 91, 285, and 527 °C. The weight loss at these
temperatures could be attributed to the dehydration due to loss of
surface and interlayer water, decomposition of the remaining low-molecular-weight
species, and dehydration and dehydroxylation of structural water.
Similarly, Fe3O4–CS/HNT displayed weight
loss at 108, 257, and 484 °C; whereas the first could be attributed
to the evaporation of adsorbed water, the last two stages could be
attributed to decomposition of the chitosan in the hybrid material.

TG analyses of (a) HNT/CS and (b) Fe3O4–HNT/CS.

The Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra of HNT/CS and Fe3O4–HNT/CS
before and after adsorption are
presented in Figure 4. The double peaks at 3600 cm–1 and above are due
to the stretching vibration of the surface hydroxyl group on the two
composites. The peaks at 471, 529, and 928 cm–1 in
HNT/CS and those at 464, 558, and 913 cm–1 in Fe3O4–HNT/CS were assigned to deformation of
Si–O–Si, Si–O–Al, and OH of inner hydroxyl
groups. The peaks at 1087 and 1014 cm–1 in HNT/CS
and Fe3O4–HNT/CS, respectively, are assigned
to Si–O. The NH2 vibration frequency could be assigned
to the peaks at 1588 and 1515 cm–1 of HNT/CS and
Fe3O4–HNT/CS, respectively, whereas the
peak at 594 cm–1 found in Fe3O4–HNT/CS is due to Fe–O. A shift in band position and
broadening of peaks were prominent after the adsorption, suggesting
further interaction between the dye and the adsorbents.

of HNT/CS and Fe3O4–HNT/CS
before adsorption and after adsorption.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of CS, HNT, HNT/CS, and Fe3O4–HNT/CS are presented in Figure 5. The characteristic peaks
of CS are shown at 14.4 and 20.5°. The XRD spectra of HNT/CS
showed that CS is well incorporated into the HNT as all of the peaks
in the individual samples were retained in their composite. The XRD
patterns of Fe3O4–HNT/CS displayed distinct
peaks at 2θ values of about 30.6, 35.9, 43.8, 57.2, and 63.1,
as marked in the figure. These peaks are characteristics of Fe3O4, thereby indicating that the composite had been
magnetically incorporated in agreement with previous studies.19

Figure 5 XRD spectra of the Fe3O4–HNT/CTS
composite.

Magnetic properties of the Fe3O4–HNT/CTS
composite are shown in Figure 6. The curves showed that magnetization increased with an increase
in the magnetic field, and also they displayed symmetrical nature
and passed through the origin. The hysteresis loop shows zero coercivity
with zero remanence, implying that the composite has a superparamagnetic
property.20,21 When compared with pure Fe3O4 with a magnetization value of 0.78 emu mg–1 (inset), Fe3O4–HNT/CS shows a lower
saturation magnetization of 0.12 emu mg–1, and this
can be attributed to the presence of larger fractions of CTS and HNT
in the composite.

composite.

2.2 Effects
of Contact Time and Initial Concentrations
on Adsorption Capacities
The effects of contact time and
initial concentrations on the uptake of CR by HNT/CS and Fe3O4–HNT/CS are presented in Figure 7a,b. A rapid adsorption of dye was noticed
in about 10–15 min of the experiment, then a quasi-equilibrium
was established, and the process displayed no significant increase
in dye uptake after 30 min in the solutions with the two adsorbents,
inferring a dynamic equilibrium (30–180 min). The adsorption
capacity at equilibrium increases from 9.2 to 35.0 and 8.7–30.9
mg g–1 for Fe3O4–HNT/CS
and HNT/CS, respectively, as the initial concentrations of CR increase
from 50 to 200 mg L–1.

Figure 7 Effects of contact time
and initial concentrations on adsorption
of CR by (a) Fe3O4–HNT/CS and (b) HNT/CS.

2.3 Effect
of pH on the Removal Efficiency of
the Adsorbent
The chemistry of the adsorption medium, to
certain extent, is a determinant in the adsorbent and adsorbate interaction,
thereby making adsorption highly pH-dependent. The efficiency of CR
removal from its aqueous solution as a function of pH between pH values
of 2 and 10 is presented in Figure 8. The pKa of CR is 4.1;22 therefore, at lower pH, the negatively charged
molecules of the dye predominate in the solution (Figure 8a), making part of the adsorbent
soluble and leading to inefficiency of the composite. As the pH increases,
the composite becomes more stable and the surface charge leads to
an increase in electrostatic interaction between the dye molecule
and the adsorbent. Fe3O4–HNT/CS adsorbed
slightly higher than the HNT/CS composite, which may be due to additional
surface charges provided by the magnetic nanoparticles.

for Fe3O4–HNT/CS and (b)
effect of pH on CR adsorption.

2.4 Effect of Adsorbent Dosage on Removal Efficiency
The effect of adsorbent dosage on the removal efficiency of CR
by Fe3O4–HNT/CS and HNT/CS is shown in Figure 9. The increase in
adsorbent dosages from 10 to 40 mg of Fe3O4–HNT/CS
led to a corresponding increase in adsorption efficiency from 97.9
to 99.6%, whereas the efficiency of HNT/CS increased from 96.07 to
97.85% as the dosage increased from 10 to 30 mg. These increase in
efficiencies may be attributed to increment in the number of adsorption
sites available for adsorption.23 However,
a further increase in adsorbent dosages led to reduced efficiency;
these observations may be a result of particle aggregation, leading
to a decrease in the total surface area of the adsorbent and an increase
in the diffusional path length.

of CR by Fe3O4–HNT/CS and HNT/CS.

2.5 Adsorption
Isotherms
Adsorption models
are mathematical and fundamental equations used to quantify and explain
the mechanism of the adsorbent–adsorbate equilibrium. In this
study, the equilibrium data were analyzed with nonlinear models of
Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin–Radushkevich, and Tempkin isotherms
presented in Table 1. The details of these models had been given elsewhere.24,25

The isotherm
models were fitted into the experimentally determined Qe vs Ce by nonlinear
regression using the Scientist 2.0 software package for Windows (Micromath
Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT). The adequacy and fitness
of the isotherm equation to the adsorption data were based on the
values of the correlation coefficients, R2.26Figure 10 shows isotherm fits for CR adsorption by
HNT/CS and Fe3O4–HNT/CS, and they were
obtained through the parameters presented in Table 2. From the figure, it is obvious that the
experimental and the theoretical data displayed a higher level of
agreement, which is evident in the values of R2 obtained for isotherm parameters. The Langmuir isotherm,
which proposed monolayer adsorption capacities of 41.54 and 54.49
mg g–1 for HNT/CS and Fe3O4–HNT/CS respectively, slightly increased the adsorption capacity
displayed by the magnetized composite, which could be attributed to
the presence of the magnetic particles. The values of RL obtained for the adsorbents implied that the duo displayed
favorable adsorption potentials toward CR. The empirical parameter,
1/n, of the Freundlich isotherm showed that the HNT/CS
sample displayed a lower surface heterogeneity than that of Fe3O4–HNT/CS and hence its higher affinity;
however, both adsorbents have 1/n values less than
1, confirming their favorable adsorption potentials toward CR.27 The Tempkin isotherm further confirms the earlier
observation of surface heterogeneity; the difference in energies of
these heterogeneous surfaces justifies the higher adsorption capacity
of Fe3O4–HNT/CS, which has lower energy
of adsorption, as shown in Table 2. The Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm allows the
estimation of the energy of adsorption on energetically heterogeneous
sites. This isotherm gave the lowest R2 when compared with others, and the value of energy obtained showed
that the adsorption of CR on HNT/CS and Fe3O4–HNT/CS is by chemisorption.

2.6 Adsorption Kinetics Studies
The description
of the adsorption rate at the solid/solution interface has been accomplished
using several kinetic models. The mechanism of adsorption and the
potential removal rate were analyzed by subjecting the kinetic data
to pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models.28 The intraparticle diffusion model was used to
investigate the diffusion-rate-controlling steps affecting the surface
reaction, to properly recognize the adsorption kinetics.29,30 The Elovich kinetic model was used to characterize the effect of
activated chemisorption on the adsorption kinetics,31 and the Bangham model was used to study the influence of
pore diffusion on the adsorption kinetics, whereas double-exponential
kinetic models properly analyzed the two-step adsorption mechanism,
i.e., the rapid and slow adsorbed fractions of the entire process.
The mathematical expressions of these models are presented in Table 3, whereas their extensive
discussion abound in the literature.24,25,30

The kinetic models were fitted into the experimentally
determined Qt vs t by
nonlinear regression,
as described for the isotherm fits. The adequacy as well as the fitness
of the kinetic equations to the experimental data was based on the
values of the correlation coefficients, R2, and sum square error function (% SSE).

The pseudo-first-order
fits (Figure 11a,b)
and second-order kinetic fits (Figure 12c,d) for the adsorption
of CR on Fe3O4–HNT/CS and HNT/CS are
presented, and the corresponding parameters are also shown in Tables 4 and 5. Pseudo-first-order adsorption kinetics by the Fe3O4–HNT/C composite displayed correlation coefficient, R2, ranging between 0.982 and 0.995 with the
experimental values of Qe showing a wide
deviation from the calculated values (Table 4). The pseudo-second-order parameter R2 ranged between 0.989 and 0.999, the experimental
values of Qe are a bit close to the calculated
values, and the %SSE showed that the adsorption process for this adsorbent
is best explained by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The rate
constant k2 is in the magnitude of 10–3; it decreases with an increase in concentration,
and the lower values obtained suggest a longer equilibrium time.32 The adsorption by HNT/CS displayed a contrary
mechanism (Table 5);
the %SSE and calculated Qe supported the
pseudo-first-order kinetic mechanism.

the adsorption of CR on Fe3O4–HNT/CS

The fitting results by the Elovich model (Figure 12a,b) and Bangham
model (Figure 12c,d)
were as displayed, whereas
the corresponding parameters are given in Tables 4 and 5. The Elovich
model displayed a better fit for adsorption by the two adsorbents;
variation in β was noted as the CR concentration increased,
which could be attributed to the relationship between the surface
activation energy and dye concentration; and the R2 and %SSE values showed that the model perfectly fitted
the data from the two adsorbents. The Bangham model displayed good
agreement with the experimental data from the adsorption processes,
and the Bangham constant kb depicts the
adsorption rate of the adsorbent. From the tables, it is obvious that
the rate increases as the concentration of the dye increases. The
correlation coefficient R2 and %SSE obtained
for this model indicate that the model perfectly explains the kinetics
of adsorption as pore-diffusion-controlled adsorption.32,33

The intraparticle diffusion and double-exponential models’
fitting results are displayed in Figure 13a–d for further understanding of
adsorption of CR on HNT/CS and Fe3O4–HNT/CS,
respectively. The corresponding parameters in the tables indicate
high correlation coefficient, R2, and
reasonably lower values of %SSE, suggesting better fittings. The intraparticle
model fitting and parameters for the two adsorbents show that the
curves do not pass through the origin, i.e., C1 ≠ 0, which is a confirmation that although the process
involved intraparticle diffusion, it is not the sole rate-controlling
step. The adsorption process is best described by the two-step mechanism,
as confirmed by the intraparticle diffusion model. Using the double-exponential
model, the fits from this model (Figure 13c,d) displayed good agreement with the data
and the process could be described as having the first step of rapid
dye uptake involving external and internal diffusion followed by a
prevailing slow step controlled by intraparticle diffusion adsorption
until equilibrium is reached.

Figure 13 Intraparticle diffusion (a, b) and double-exponential
model (c,
d) fits for the adsorption of CR on Fe3O4–HNT/CS
and HNT/CS, respectively.

2.7 Thermodynamics of the Adsorption Process
The thermodynamics of the adsorption processes was studied by subjecting
equilibrium data at various temperatures to respective thermodynamic eqs 1–3. These equations enable the determination of the free energies
(ΔG°), enthalpies (ΔH°), and changes in entropy (ΔS°)
associated with the adsorption processes.33 1  where m is the adsorbent
dosage, Qe is adsorption capacity at equilibrium,
and Ce is the equilibrium concentration
of the dye. 2   3  The van’t Hoff plot for the adsorption
of CR by Fe3O4–HNT/CS and HNT/CS is shown
in Figure 14, whereas
the thermodynamics parameters are presented in Table 6.

by Fe3O4–HNT/CS and HNT/CS.

343	4.316	–12.308	 	 	 	3.595	–10.251	 	 	 	
The thermodynamic
parameters obtained for the two adsorbents revealed
that the enthalpies of adsorption, ΔH°,
were positive, connoting an increase in the adsorption efficiency
with an increase in the process temperature, whereas the positive
values of entropies, ΔS°, indicated that
there was an affinity between the CR molecules and adsorbent surfaces
and that the degree of dispersion of the process increased with an
increase in temperature. The spontaneity of the adsorption of CR by
the adsorbents was revealed by the negative Gibbs free energy (ΔG) values obtained at various temperatures, suggesting favorable
adsorption of CR by the adsorbents at a higher temperature.

2.8 Regeneration Study
One of the important
factors usually considered for the selection of adsorbent is reusability;
the higher the reusability, the lower the cost.20 To investigate the reusability of Fe3O4–HNT/CS and HNT/CS, the adsorption regeneration test were
carried out according to the method described by Wang et al.34 The solution of Congo red dye was poured into
a syringe previously loaded with the adsorbents, and the syringe was
then inverted into a sample collection bottle (Figures 15a and 16). The solution
from outlet becomes clearer and the concentration of the dye in the
outlet by comparing its absorbance with that of dye solution. The
strong electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent and the dye
molecules makes it difficult for the dye to be eluted by deionized
water (Figure 15b);
however, squeezing with 0.1 M NaOH solution for about 30 s and washing
several times with distilled water until neutral pH restores the adsorbent
for reuse (Figure 15c). Similar processes were repeated for the magnetic composite (Figure 15d) with similar
observations. A series of compression and recycling procedures were
performed, and it is amazing to note that the adsorbents were recovered
with little or no deformation, with intact efficiency of the adsorbents
until after about 6 cycles when it was reduced to ≈95 and 87%
for HNT/CS and Fe3O4–HNT/CS, respectively.
This implied that the adsorbent exhibited excellent resilience, recyclability,
and durability with better reusability; therefore, the composites
are promising adsorbents and highly economical for CR removal.

3 Conclusions
The synthesis of Fe3O4–HNT/CS and
HNT/CS was successful according to the results of characterizations,
as well as their use as adsorbents for the removal of CR from aqueous
solution. However, the adsorption processes for the removal of CR
dye depend on the contact time, initial pollutant concentration, solution
pH, adsorbent dosage, and temperature. The isotherm fits well with
the adsorption data with the Langmuir isotherm model showing the maximum
monolayer adsorption capacities of 41.54 and 54.49 mg g–1 for adsorption of CR by Fe3O4–HNT/CS
and HNT/CS, respectively. The kinetic models showed that intraparticle
diffusion was not the sole rate-determination step for the adsorption
process; rather, rapid external and internal diffusion followed by
a prevailing slow step controlled the rate. The models are suitable
for the prediction of the adsorption processes. The thermodynamic
parameters of free energy, enthalpy, and entropy changes proved that
the present adsorption process is feasible, spontaneous, endothermic,
and random in nature. The overall analysis by kinetics, isotherms,
and thermodynamics suggested that the adsorption of CR by Fe3O4–HNT/CS and HNT/CS is through chemisorption involving
interaction between dye molecules and the functional groups present
on the adsorbent surfaces. Consequently, it is obvious that Fe3O4–HNT/CS and HNT/CS are effective adsorbents
for the removal of Congo red dye from aqueous solution.

4 Materials and Method
4.1 Materials
Halloysite
clay nanotube
(HNT), chitosan (90% deacetylation degree), iron(III) chloride hexahydrate
(FeCl3·6H2O), and iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate
(FeCl2·4H2O) (AR grade) were products of
Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide were procured
from Merck, India. Congo red dye was a product of Loba Chemicals,
India. Other reagents were of analytical grade, and MilliQ water was
used for all of the experiments.

4.2 Synthesis
of the Spongelike HNT/CS Composite
HNT was activated by suspending
4 g of the powder in 40 mL of NaOH
(24% w/v) and sonicated at 50 °C for 1 h. It was washed with
distilled water and dried at 105 °C overnight, and the resulting
solid was ground to <200 μm mesh size. CS was also activated
by dissolving 1 g of the powder in 25 mL of acetic acid (2% v/v) solution
under continuous stirring. Then, 1 g of the activated HNT was dispersed
into the solution of the chitosan sonicated for 25 min and stirred
further for 2 h. At that point, the arrangement was poured into a
round and hollow plastic shape. Subsequently, it was frozen into ice
at −20 °C, kept overnight in a freezer, and then lyophilized
at −80 °C using a freeze dryer. The product was washed
with distilled water until pH is neutral and dried in a vacuum oven
overnight at 60 °C.

4.3 Preparation of the Fe3O4–HNT/CS Composite
The mixed solution
of 2 mmol of
FeCl3·6H2O and 1 mmol of FeCl2·4H2O (50 mL) was prepared and stirred for 1 h, and
1 g of prepared HNT/CS was immersed in the solution mixture under
mechanical shaking. It was then transferred into 50 mL of ammonia
solution (35% v/v) to allow coprecipitation of the magnetic particles.
The mixture was transferred into a water bath at 60 °C where
2 mL of glutaraldehyde (25% v/v) was slowly dropped into the reaction
system and stirred for another 1 h. The product was washed thrice
with ethanol and distilled water and then dried overnight in a vacuum
oven.

4.4 Characterizations
The morphology
and elemental composition of the prepared spongelike HNT/CS and Fe3O4–HNT/CS were investigated using SEM (Hitachi,
Japan, S-3000H) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of these samples were obtained by an X-ray
diffractometer (PANalytical, X’Pert PRO, Netherlands) using
Cu Kα (γ = 1.54178 Å) radiation. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded from 400 to 4000 cm–1 in a TENSOR 27 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) using the KBr pellet
technique. The magnetic properties of the Fe3O4 and Fe3O4–HNT/CS composites were characterized
with a vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM) (Lake Shore, 735 VSM, model
7304), whereas thermal stabilities were evaluated using thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) recorded by an SDT Q600 V8.3 Build 101 simultaneous
DSC–TGA instrument.

4.5 Preparations of Aqueous
Solution of the Dye
A stock solution containing Congo red
dye was prepared by dissolving
accurately weighed solute such that the solution contained 1 g equivalent
of the dye in 1 L of MilliQ water, and working standard solutions
were then prepared from the stock by dilution. The pH of the working
solution was maintained with aliquot of HCl or NaOH prior to the adsorption
study.

4.6 Adsorption Studies
The batch equilibrium
and kinetic adsorption studies were conducted using Erlenmeyer flasks
containing 25 mL of dye solutions with a concentration range of 50–200
mL–1 and with 0.4 g L–1 adsorbents.
The contents were placed in a regulated water bath (30 ± 1 °C)
with a shaker at 150 rpm, samples were collected at pre-set time intervals,
and the dye concentrations in aqueous media were recorded by reading
the absorbance at 497 nm on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV–vis–NIR,
Varian 500 Scan Cary). The amounts of dye adsorbed (mg g–1) by the adsorbents as a function of time (Qt) and at equilibrium (Qe) were
estimated according to eqs 4 and 5 below 4   5  where Co, Ct, and Ce are the
initial, time t, and equilibrium concentrations (mg
L–1) of the dye, respectively; V is the volume (L) of the solution; and m is the
mass (g) of the adsorbent.
