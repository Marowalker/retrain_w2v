Cross-linked thermosets are investigated
by 13C solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine their structure
and to distinguish important epoxy resins and hardening agents. In
addition to the epoxy resin and hardening agent, the identification
of phosphorus-containing flame retardants is demonstrated by 31P solid-state NMR. These studies provide a spectral database
for routine use, which is finally applied to analyze commercial products
containing an unknown multicomponent system.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
outstanding physical–chemical properties of epoxy-based
thermosets make these materials very interesting for industry applications
in, for example, automotive or aerospace technology.1 These properties include a high resistance against chemicals
and corrosion, low cure shrinkage, excellent electrical insulation
behavior, and high thermal stability. Moreover, these materials have
a good compatibility with a large number of materials and no volatiles
are formed during curing processes.1,2 Although thermosets
have a widespread use in our daily life, detailed knowledge on their
complex composition and structure is limited up to now. This knowledge
is however of importance to optimize them for specific applications
and to understand their long-time stability. An uncured formulation
consists of at least two components, namely, (i) the epoxy resin that
typically contains reactive epoxy groups and (ii) a hardening agent
that contains different functional groups enabling a curing process
with the epoxy resin. Such hardening agents can be, for example, aliphatic,
cycloaliphatic, or aromatic amines. To form a highly cross-linked
network, commercial epoxy resins usually contain two or more epoxy
groups and the hardening agents two or four reactive groups per molecule.3 In addition to the selected epoxy resin and hardening
agents, different additives (modifiers) and flame retardants may be
mixed to change the properties of the thermoset.1,3 In
that way, thermosets can be designed to be rigid, filled or foamed,
fire-retardant, and resistant to heat and chemicals.1

To ensure an almost complete curing process, epoxy
resins and amine-containing
hardening agents have to be combined in a defined stoichiometric ratio.
For this purpose, the epoxy equivalent weight (EEW)4 and the amine hydrogen equivalent weight (AHEW)5 of the components have to be taken into account.
During the curing process, a 3D network is formed, which makes the
cured epoxy resins insoluble, durable, stable, and not meltable.2

Uncured epoxy formulations or partially
cross-linked epoxy resins
can be characterized by a number of analytical techniques including
spectroscopy, thermal analysis, or mass spectrometry. Specifically,
for the analysis of elastomers containing partially cross-linked epoxy
resins, pyrolysis GC–MS is mainly used to study their chemical
composition.6 Additives in elastomers can
be detached by means of Soxhlet extraction. Further separation of
individual compounds in the extract by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC)7 enables the identification of each
component by techniques, such as MALDI-ToF-MS,6 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).8

Thermosets, however, are usually fully
cross-linked. It is therefore
not feasible to dissolve the resin or components, which makes their
characterization more challenging. Up to now, pyrolysis GC–MS
has been used for the damage analysis of thermosets. Puype et al.9 have demonstrated that pyrolysis GC–MS
can be employed to analyze thermosets with respect to contained flame
retardants. As a result, the presence of a specific flame retardant
in the thermoset has been proven. However, no structural details about
the resin and hardening agent in the cross-linked thermoset are available
with this characterization technique.

To learn more about the
composition and structure of the cured
epoxy network, infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)10−13 and solid-state NMR (ssNMR)10−12,14−18 have been applied. For example, ssNMR has been successfully
used to investigate the nature of chemical reactions during the curing
process, including intramolecular processes taking place and the formation
of side products,10,14 or to determine the degradation
of epoxy resins under high energy irradiation.16 Moreover, the kinetics of the curing process has been studied
by means of ssNMR.15

Although these
works addressed the NMR signal assignment, studies
that compare different hardening agents and epoxy resins have not
been presented, and a spectral database for routine characterization
of systems with unknown composition is still missing. Thus, the aim
of this work is to investigate various cured epoxy resins with different
hardening agents by means of ssNMR to determine the original components.
This will be the basis to build a database for routine analysis of
thermosets with unknown composition.

To evaluate ssNMR for the
characterization of thermosets, model
systems containing the epoxy resins bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (DGEBA; Scheme 1 (I)) or bisphenol
F diglycidyl ether (DGEBF; Scheme 1 (II)) and various amine hardening agents are investigated
by 1H → 13C cross-polarization magic-angle
spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP MAS NMR). In a second step,
a flame retardant is added to some of the model systems. 1H → 13C and 1H → 31P CP MAS NMR experiments are applied to identify flame retardants
in cured epoxy-based thermosets. Finally, two commercial products
of unknown composition are investigated to determine the contained
epoxy resin, the hardening agent, and flame retardant.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 General Methods
Model systems of
fully cured epoxy-based thermosets were synthesized and analyzed via
ssNMR. For these model systems, the epoxy resins bisphenol A diglycidyl
ether (DGEBA; structure in Scheme 1; Sigma-Aldrich) and bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (DGEBF;
structure in Scheme 1; Sigma-Aldrich) were cured with different amine-containing hardening
agents, namely, triethylenetetramine (TETA; structure in Figure S5; Acros Organics), isophorendiamine
(IPDA; structure in Figure S6; Sigma-Aldrich),
diethyltoluenediamine (DETDA 80, an isomeric mixture containing 80%
of 3,5-diethyl-2,4-diaminotoluene and 20% of 3,5-diethyl-2,6-diaminotoluene;
structure in Figure S7; Haihang Industry),
4,4′-methylenebis(2,6-diisopropylaniline) (M-DIPA; structure
in Figure S8; abcr), or 4,4′-methylenebis(2,6-diethylaniline)
(M-DEA; structure in Figure S9; Sigma-Aldrich).
In addition to these components, the phosphorus-containing oligomeric
flame retardants for epoxy-based thermosets, which have been given
the trade names DOPO (9,10-dihydro-9-oxy-10-phosphaphenanthren-10-oxid;
structure in Figure S11a; HARKE Chemicals),
DXM (structure in Figure S11b; Metadynea),
HFC-X (structure in Figure S11c; Sigma-Aldrich),
and SPB 100 (structure in Figure S11d;
Haihang Industry) were added to some of the samples. Finally, to apply
our approach, two commercially available adhesives (C01 and C02) with
unknown composition and structure were investigated.

2.2 Synthesis of Cured Epoxy-Based Thermosets
To form epoxy-based
thermosets, a stoichiometric amount of the
appropriate epoxy resin and hardening agent were mixed, homogenized,
and cured in an oven with air ventilation. The cured epoxy resins
were pulverized by a cryogenic mill or by rasp and separated from
possible non-cross-linked components by Soxhlet extraction for 12
h with acetone yielding the epoxy-based thermosets.

The compositions
of the epoxy-based thermosets, which are addressed in this work, are
listed in Table 1.
The epoxy resin and amine-containing hardening agent have to be mixed
in a stoichiometric ratio to reach an almost complete curing of the
samples. For this purpose, the epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) and the
hydrogen equivalent weight (HEW) of the respective components, which
are listed in Table 2, were taken into account.

Assuming
that about 3 g of each sample has to be produced, specific
amounts of the epoxy resin and hardening agent according to the EEW
and HEW values were weighed (Table 2) and mixed.

Next to these epoxy-based thermosets,
additional ones were synthesized
containing various phosphorus-containing flame retardants. The compositions
of these samples are listed in Table 3.

For the curing process,
each sample was transferred into a small
aluminum tray and cured in a convection oven (Binder) employing the
curing programs listed in Table 4. The temperature was continuously increased at 1 °C/min
between each step in the curing program.

2.3 Characterization by Solid-State NMR
Approximately 50
mg of each pulverized thermoset sample was filled
in a 4 mm ZrO2 rotor for ssNMR analytics. All ssNMR measurements
were performed on a Bruker Avance III HD 300 spectrometer (Rheinstetten,
Germany) employing a 4 mm broad band H/X probe. Spectra were recorded
at 7 T, corresponding to a frequency of 121.49 MHz for 31P and 75.47 MHz for 13C, at 10 kHz spinning, respectively,
at room temperature. Spectra were referenced to phosphoric acid for 31P (0 ppm) and to TMS (0 ppm) for 13C using adamantane
(+38.5 ppm) as an external standard. The ramped CP MAS sequence19 was utilized with a contact time of 3.2 ms for 1H → 31P CP MAS and 3.0 ms for 1H → 13C CP MAS experiments. The recycle delay was
set to 2 s, and tppm decoupling20 employing
a 15° phase jump was applied during data acquisition. The acquisition
time for 1H → 13C CP MAS was set to 50
ms and that for 1H → 31P CP MAS to 25
ms. All spectra were recorded with 2048 scans. The radiofrequency
field strengths were 70 kHz for 1H, 50 kHz for 13C, and 28 kHz for 31P.

In addition to the model
systems, spectra of the pure epoxy resins, the hardening agents and
the flame retardants were recorded. In cases where these compounds
are liquids, 13C NMR spectra under static conditions were
acquired employing single pulse excitation. An excitation pulse length
of 3.5 μs was used, and the spectra were recorded with 1024
scans and a recycle delay of 2 s. The acquisition time for the single
pulse experiments was set to 30 ms.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Epoxy Component and Amine
Containing Hardening
Agent
Various samples were prepared from different combinations
of epoxy resin and amine-containing hardening agent and were investigated
by means of 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectroscopy
to analyze the resulting thermosets with respect to their components
and structure. The 13C resonances marked in Figure 1a with a plus sign (+) are
visible in all spectra shown in Figure 1a–e. They are attributed to the 13C nuclei of cross-linked DGEBA according to the literature.16 Similarly, the 13C resonances marked
with a number sign (#) in Figure 1f are visible in all spectra shown in Figure 1f–j. They are assigned
to 13C nuclei of cross-linked DGEBF according to the literature.17 Details on the chemical shifts of these resonances
and their assignments to structural groups of the epoxy resins are
given in Table S1, and the spectra of pure
DGEBA and DGEBF are shown in Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information. The signals at 70.4 and 61.8
ppm marked with a prime (′) appear for every amine-cured epoxy
resin. The underlying structural elements formed in each amine-cured
epoxy resin from the reaction of an epoxide with an amine are shown
in Scheme 2. Details
on the chemical shifts and their assignments to structural elements
are listed in Table 5.

samples a–j. On the left side, the specific signals of DGEBA
(a–e) are marked with a plus sign (+). On the right side, the
specific signals of DGEBF (f–j) are marked with a number sign
(#). Signals marked with a prime (′) are signals that appear
for every epoxy resin. Specific signals of the appropriate hardening
agent are marked with asterisks.

R′ represents aromatic
groups, and R″ represents aliphatic or aromatic groups.

Table 5 13C Chemical Shifts of
the Specific Signals of Structural Elements Formed in Each Amine-Cured
Epoxy Resin
Typically, three
signals are expected for this structure. However,
the calculated difference in the chemical shift between the carbon
atom 1 and the carbon atom 2 is only 2 ppm.
Since the line width of the signal at 70.4 ppm is about 560 Hz the
individual signals are not resolved and thus only one signal is observed
for the carbons 1 and 2.

By comparing
the spectra of samples containing different epoxy
resins and equal amine-containing hardening agent (e.g., Figure 1a compared with Figure 1f), specific signals
of the hardening agent can be identified, which are independent of
the epoxy resin. These signals are marked throughout the spectra with
an asterisk. Details on the chemical shifts and their assignments
to structural groups of the hardening agents are listed in Table 6. For comparison,
the spectra of the pure hardening agents are shown in Supporting Information, Figures S5–S9.
Note that only a few signals of the hardening agents are visible in
the spectra since the remaining signals are overlapped by signals
of the epoxy resins. In case signals of structural groups of the hardening
agents cannot be clearly identified in the spectra due to such an
overlay, it is indicated in Table 6. Spinning sidebands are not expected for these samples
as demonstrated exemplary for DGEBA + DETDA 80 (for details see Supporting Information, Figure S10).

Table 6 13C Chemical Shifts and
Corresponding Structural Groups of the Specific Signals of the Amine-Containing
Hardening Agents of Figure 1
The amine containing hardening
agents TETA (spectra a and f in Figure 1) and IPDA (spectra
b and g in Figure 1) are distinguishable by additional signals in the aliphatic region.
While TETA shows only one additional signal in the aliphatic region
at 56.7 ppm, IPDA shows five signals at 51.1, 36.9, 32.0, 28.3, and
24.9 ppm. By using the DGEBA resin, the signals at 32.0 and 28.3 ppm
of IDPA are overlapped by a signal of the resin. The spectra of cured
epoxy resins containing aromatic amine hardening agents (spectra c–e
and h–j in Figure 1) should be recognizable by differences in the aromatic region.
Due to an overlay of the four signals of DGEBA in the aromatic region
with potential signals of the hardening agents (spectra c–e
in Figure 1), only
for M-DIPA (spectra d in Figure 1), an additional signal in the aromatic region is obtained
at 148.4 ppm. This additional signal in the aromatic region is assigned
to the quaternary carbon of the −Cq(arom.)–CH–(CH3)2 moiety.

Luckily, all used aromatic hardening
agents contain additional
aliphatic substituents and thus show signals also in the aliphatic
region. These signals can be used as a fingerprint to distinguish
between different hardening agents. Comparing spectra c and h in Figure 1, there are three
signals at 23.9, 19.0, and 16.8 ppm, which are representative for
DETDA 80. For M-DIPA (spectra d and i in Figure 1), a broad signal is observed, which is split
into two signals at 26.9 and 25.5 ppm. Finally, for M-DEA (spectra
e and j in Figure 1), there are two specific signals in the aliphatic region at 24.5
and 15.6 ppm.

Using DGEBF as a resin, an additional signal in
the aromatic region
at 142.5 ppm (spectrum h in Figure 1) is observed for DETDA 80. For the hardening agent
M-DIPA (spectrum i in Figure 1), an additional signal at 140.2 ppm is found, which is overlapped
by signals of the resin when using DGEBA (spectrum d in Figure 1). By using the hardening agent
M-DEA (spectrum j in Figure 1), an additional signal at 143.8 ppm is observed. These additional
signals ease the distinguishing of DETDA 80, M-DIPA, and M-DEA in
case DGEBF is employed as a resin.

3.2 Phosphorus-Containing
Flame Retardants
Next to thermosets containing only epoxy
resins and amine hardening
agents, flame retardants are often added, which have to be also addressed
by ssNMR. As typical model systems, we studied the phosphorus-containing
flame retardants DOPO, DXM, HFC-X, and SPB 100. First, 1H → 13C CP MAS spectra of the pure flame retardants
were recorded (see Supporting Information, Figure S11), and the observed signals were assigned to the structural
motifs of the flame retardants. These spectra can serve as a reference
for the identification of flame retardants in epoxy resins. Following
the analysis of the pure flame retardants, thermosets consisting of
the epoxy components DGEBA or DGEBF, the amine curing agent IPDA and
the respective flame retardant were investigated by 1H
→ 13C CP MAS NMR. By comparing the 1H
→ 13C CP MAS spectra of the thermosets with those
of the pure flame retardant, characteristic signals of the flame retardant
have to be identifiable. Such a comparison is shown in Figure 2 for the flame retardant HFC-
X.

Figure 2 1H → 13C CP MAS spectrum of pure HFC-X
and spectra of samples containing ca. 10 wt % of the flame retardant
HFC-X, the hardening agent IPDA, and the epoxy resin DGEBA or DGEBF.

As seen in the spectra, many signals of the flame
retardant are
overlaid by signals of the epoxy resin or the hardening agent. The
signal at 149.3 ppm of the flame retardant can also be concealed by
other signals and is observed only in the spectrum of the model system
containing DGEBF. Because of the low amount of the flame retardant
(ca. 10 wt %) in the model samples, the intensity of the signal at
149.3 ppm in the model systems is low. This makes it difficult to
unambiguously identify the retardant by means of 13C ssNMR.

Since many flame retardants are derivates of 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide
(DOPO) and thus contain phosphor, 31P ssNMR studies are
employed to identify them and to shed more light on their structures. Figure 3 shows the 1H → 31P CP MAS spectra of the pure flame retardants
DOPO, DXM, HFC-X, and SPB 100 and the assignment of the 31P signals to different structural motifs, which allows us to distinguish
them.

Figure 3 1H → 31P CP MAS NMR spectra of the
phosphorus-containing flame retardants (a) DOPO, (b) DXM, (c) HFC-X,
and (d) SPB 100. Signals marked with tilde (∼) are spinning
sidebands.

For DOPO (Figure 3a), besides the main signal at 10.4 ppm (−O—P=O, 1), two signals with a lower intensity are observed at 13.5
and 23.2 ppm. The additional signal at 13.5 ppm most probably refers
to the phosphorous nucleus 1′ in 6-hydroxy-(6H)-dibenzo[1,2]oxaphosphorine (DOPO-OH) since DOPO-OH is
present in tautomeric equilibrium with DOPO.21 The signal at 23.2 ppm is attributed to the phosphorous nucleus 2′ of 2′-hydroxydiphenyl-2-phosphinic acid,
which is formed by the reaction of DOPO with water.22 In the 1H → 31P CP MAS NMR
spectrum of the flame retardant DXM (Figure 3b), the main signal is obtained at 5.6 ppm,
which is assigned to the phosphorous nucleus 1 in DXM.
In addition to this signal, a shoulder is visible at 2.5 ppm. This
signal probably refers to the phosphorous nucleus 1′ of (DOP)3Mel, which is the precursor for DXM.23

The 1H → 31P CP MAS NMR spectrum of
HFC-X (Figure 3c) shows
two specific signals at 31.1 and 3.9 ppm, which can be assigned to
the two different phosphorous nuclei 1 and 2 in HFC-X.

In the 1H → 31P CP
MAS NMR spectrum
of the flame retardant SPB 100 (Figure 3d), several 31P signals are observed, although
only one phosphorus species is expected for this flame retardant.
In addition to the main signal at 8.8 ppm, signals in the high field
range from −10.5 to −23.0 ppm appear. While the main
signal at 8.8 ppm is attributed to the phosphorous nuclei 1 in SPB 100, the additional signals ranging from −10.5 to
−23.0 ppm may refer to phosphorous (1′–5′) present in impurities of the precursors of SPB
100.24

Figure 4 compares
the 1H → 31P CP MAS NMR spectra of pure
HFC-X and the model systems DGEBA + IPDA + HFC-X and DGEBF + IPDA
+ HFC-X. According to the structural assignment of 31P
signals of different flame retardants in the previous paragraph, the
signals at 31.1 and 4.0 ppm clearly identify the flame retardant HFC-X
in the model systems. Such additional 1H → 31P CP MAS NMR studies are especially important in cases where
only small amounts of flame retardant (e.g., 1 wt %) are present in
a sample and the sensitivity of 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR experiments is too low to detect a signal of the retardant
or the signal is concealed by other signals of the system.

Figure 4 1H → 31P CP MAS NMR spectrum of pure
HFC-X and spectra of samples containing 10 wt % of the flame retardant
HFC-X, the hardening agent IPDA, and the epoxy resin DGEBA or DGEBF.
Signals marked with tilde (∼) are spinning sidebands.

This is illustrated in the Supporting Information, Figure S12 where 1H → 13C CP MAS
NMR spectra of model systems containing DGEBA, IPDA, and different
amounts of the flame retardant HFC-X are shown. No additional signal
is obtained for the sample containing 1 wt % of the flame retardant
HFC-X compared to the sample containing no flame retardant. Using
10 wt % of the flame retardant, an additional signal at 149.3 ppm
appears. Because of the concealing of this signal by other signals
(see Figure 2), this
signal at 149.3 ppm is however not specific enough to clearly identify
the flame retardant. Thus, it is necessary to measure 1H → 31P CP MAS NMR spectra for identification.

Two signals at 31.3 and 4.2 ppm are obtained in the 1H
→ 31P CP MAS NMR spectra (Figure 5) of the samples containing 10 and 1 wt %
of the flame retardant, respectively. According to the interpretation
of the spectra in Figures 3 and 4, these signals confirm the presence
of the retardant HFC-X in both these samples.

containing different amounts of the flame retardant HFC-X, the hardening
agent IPDA, and the epoxy resin DGEBA. Signals marked with tilde (∼)
are spinning sidebands.

3.3 Systems
Containing Several Hardening Agents
Since thermosets can
contain several hardening agents, it is also
important to analyze the ability of our ssNMR approach for such systems.
For this purpose, the multicomponent model systems DGEBA + M-DIPA
+ M-DEA and DGEBA + M-DIPA + DETDA 80 were synthesized and analyzed
by ssNMR.

Comparison of the signals of the three-component thermoset
DGEBA + M-DIPA + M-DEA on the left side in Figure 6 with the specific signals of the thermosets
containing only the hardening agents M-DIPA or M-DEA (Figure 1d and Figure 1e), it is obtained that specific signals
of both hardening agents are present in the multicomponent system.
The observed specific signals of M-DIPA are marked with blue bars,
and the specific signals of M-DEA are marked with red bars. Especially,
the signals of M-DIPA at 148.4 and 26.9 ppm and the signal of M-DEA
at 15.6 ppm are characteristic for this mixture and can be used as
probes to distinguish between the two hardening agents. On the other
hand, the signals at 24.5 and 26.9 ppm are too close to each other
and thus are insufficient for the differentiation.

Figure 6 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectra of different
three-component systems and spectra of the corresponding two-component
systems.

In the second sample, M-DEA was
replaced by DETDA 80 (right side
in Figure 6). The specific
signals of the hardening agents are obtainable for this sample similar
to the previous sample. The observed specific signals of M-DIPA are
marked with blue bars, and the specific signals of DETDA 80 are marked
with red bars. According to our interpretation of Figure 6, the signals at 148.4 and
26.9 ppm are characteristic for M-DIPA. In addition to this, two signals
at 19.0 and 16.8 ppm are obtained in the spectrum of the three-component
system (right side in Figure 6), which are attributed to DETDA 80. This clearly demonstrates
the feasibility to distinguish M-DIPA and DETDA 80 in a three-component
system by means of 13C ssNMR.

3.4 Characterization
of a Two-Component Commercial
Product
The previous analyses have been performed on model
systems with defined composition. To demonstrate that this type of
analysis is also applicable to “real-world” systems,
we carried out the analysis on a commercial two-component adhesive
as a proof of concept. In the first step, the epoxy component of the
adhesive has to be identified. For this, the 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectrum of the commercial product is compared
with the spectra of samples containing the typically employed epoxy
resins DGEBA or DGEBF and the common hardening agent TETA (Figure 7). For this comparison,
it is necessary to know the chemical shift values of all specific
signals of the epoxy resins, which are collected in the Supporting Information, Table S1. The corresponding
spectra are shown in Figure S1 for DGEBA
and in Figure S2 for DGEBF in the Supporting
Information.

Figure 7 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectra
of samples
containing the hardening agent TETA and the epoxy resin DGEBA or DGEBF
compared with the spectrum of a commercial product.

By comparing the 1H → 13C CP
MAS NMR
spectrum of the commercial product with the spectra of the model systems,
it is indicated that DGEBA was used as an epoxy resin in the commercial
product (C01). This is demonstrated by the fact that the 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectrum of the commercial product
shows signals with specific chemical shifts at 157.1, 144.0, 128.2,
117.7, 41.9, and 31.6 ppm (dotted lines) that are attributed to DGEBA.

After the successful determination of the resin, the used amine
containing hardening agent has to be identified. The comparison of
the 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectrum of the
commercial product with reference spectra of samples containing the
epoxy resin DGEBA and different amine-containing hardening agents
is shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectra of samples
containing the epoxy resin DGEBA and different amine-containing hardening
agents compared with the spectrum of a commercial product.

From Figure 8, it
is clearly seen that the spectrum of the commercial product (C01)
shows additional signals at 51.1, 36.9, and 28.3 ppm besides the signals
of DGEBA. These signals indicate the presence of the amine-containing
hardening agent IPDA (dotted lines). From this analysis, we can conclude
that the commercial product mainly contains the epoxy resin DGEBA
and the hardening agent IPDA. A quantification of the two components
would require the use of time-consuming direct excitation 13C MAS NMR experiments. Alternatively, a semiquantitative analysis
may be performed, which requires the measurement of 1H
→ 13C CP MAS spectra with different contact times
and their analysis to understand the cross-polarization process25 in the system. Both are beyond the scope of
the present work.

3.5 Characterization of a Multicomponent
Commercial
Product Containing an Additional Retardant
In a similar fashion,
we analyzed a second commercial product of unknown composition (C02).
Again, the epoxy component was determined by comparing the 1H → 13C CP MAS spectrum of sample C02 with the
spectra of model systems containing TETA and the epoxy component DGEBA
or DGEBF.

The 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR
spectra in Figure 9 demonstrate that the commercial product C02 contains specific signals
of the epoxy resin DGEBA (dotted lines). Thus, the epoxy component
in the unknown sample is identified as DGEBA. Similar to the previous
analysis on C01, the used amine-containing hardening agent is determined
by comparing the 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR
spectrum of sample C02 with reference spectra of samples containing
the epoxy resin DGEBA and different amine-containing hardening agents
as shown in Figure 10.

Figure 9 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectra of samples
containing the hardening agent TETA and the epoxy resin DGEBA or DGEBF
compared with the spectrum of an unknown sample C02.

Figure 10 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectra of samples
containing the epoxy resin DGEBA and different amine-containing hardening
agents compared with the spectrum of sample C02.

From Figure 10,
it is clearly visible that the spectrum of sample C02 does not match
completely to one of the reference spectra. This let us assume that
a third component is present in this sample. Detailed analysis of
the spectra shows that the specific signals of the amine-containing
hardening agents M-DIPA at 148.4 and 25.8 ppm (blue bars) and IPDA
at 51.1 and 36.9 ppm (red bars) match to the signals of sample C02,
which implies that C02 contains both M-DIPA and IPDA. Since, in addition
to the epoxy component and the amine-containing hardening agent, also
flame retardants may be present in the sample, the 1H → 31P CP MAS spectrum of C02 was recorded and compared with the
spectra of different pure flame retardants.

As shown in Figure 11, the 31P chemical shift of the signal in the spectrum
of C02 (10.5 ppm) matches with the signal obtained for the flame retardant
DOPO (10.4 ppm). This is a strong indication of the presence of DOPO
in the sample C02. These results clearly demonstrate that the composition
of the commercial product can be analyzed by a combination of 13C and 31P ssNMR.

pure flame retardants compared with the spectrum of sample C02.

4 Conclusions
The
present study examines the application potential of ssNMR spectroscopy
for the characterization of thermosets with regard to their original
components and structure. The evaluation was carried out on defined
model systems of epoxy resins and various amine-containing hardening
agents. Specific signals in the ssNMR spectra of each epoxy resin,
each phosphorus-containing flame retardant, and each used amine-containing
hardening agent tested here were identified. To show that the presented
analysis method is not only limited to model systems but can also
be applied to commercial products, the composition of two commercial
products was determined by our approach. The results showed that,
also for multicomponent samples of unknown composition, the identification
of the single components is feasible via specific signals within the
sensitivity of solid-state NMR. By combination of solid-state NMR
with dynamic nuclear polarization, sensitivity issues may be overcome
in the future.
