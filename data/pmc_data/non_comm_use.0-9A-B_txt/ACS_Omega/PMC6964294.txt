In modern biorefineries, low value lignin and hemicellulose
fractions
are produced as side streams. New extraction methods for their purification
are needed in order to utilize the whole biomass more efficiently
and to produce special target products. In several new applications
using plant-based biomaterials, the native-type chemical and polymeric
properties are desired. Especially, production of high-quality native-type
lignin enables valorization of biomass entirely, thus making novel
processes sustainable and economically viable. To investigate sulfur-free
possibilities for so-called “lignin first” technologies,
we compared alkaline organosolv, formic acid organosolv, and ionic
liquid processes to simple soda “cooking” using wheat
straw and aspen as raw materials. All experiments were carried out
using microwave-assisted pulping approach to enable rapid heat transfer
and convenient control of temperature and pressure. The main target
was to evaluate the advantage of a brief hot water extraction as a
pretreatment for the pulping process. Most of these novel pulping
methods resulted in high-quality lignin, which may be valorized more
diversely than kraft lignin. Lignin fractions were thoroughly analyzed
with NMR (13C and HSQC) and gel permeation chromatography
to study the quality of the collected lignin. The cellulose fractions
were analyzed by determining their lignin contents and carbohydrate
profiles for further utilization in cellulose-based products or biofuels.

Introduction
The rapid increase in the demand for materials
and energy has made
it necessary to find new sustainable sources of fine chemicals and
liquid fuels.1,2 Exhaustion of fossil fuels and
growing concern about greenhouse emissions drive the interest into
lignocellulosic biomass. As the most abundant source of concentrated
organic material, it can be processed into renewable materials, such
as textile fibers and platform chemicals for industrial processes.3,4 Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable carbon-neutral resource,
which makes it an lucrative option for various product streams. Carbohydrates
can be converted, for example, to biofuels, such as ethanol and butanol,
via saccharification and fermentation.5 Lignin side streams have potential to replace fossil-based aromatics
in production of phenolic substructures and larger phenolic materials,
for example, aromatic chemicals, antioxidants, phenolic resins, adhesives,
binders, carbon fiber precursors, biofuels, and fuel additives.6−8 Hemicelluloses have potential, for example, as hydrophilic swelling
agents in pharmaceutical, biomedical, and food industries. Other applications
include gels and biofilms in textile and paper industries as well
as in aerogels for thermal insulation materials.9,22

For valorization of biomass, it is necessary to break down the
recalcitrant cell wall structures that protect the plant from environmental
decay and assures resistance to both chemical and biological attacks.10 Currently, in pulp mills, the kraft process
is the most dominant pulping method for breaking down the wood cell
wall structures, enabling effective valorization of the plant carbohydrates
with concomitant formation of kraft lignin. This extremely complex
industrial process has required more than hundred years of technological
and methodological development.11 Even
though it is economically viable way to separate cellulose fibers,
it requires huge initial investments, and in the process itself around
half of the initial material, that is, lignin and hemicellulose, ends
up in the cooking liquor as nonvalue side stream. Kraft lignin is
mostly combusted for heat energy because worthwhile applications have
been lacking because of its heterogeneous nature. Thus, novel, straightforward,
technologically less demanding, and sulfur-free processing methods
are needed for pulping of wood (e.g., aspen) and agricultural crop
waste (e.g., wheat straw). In addition, the goal is to collect lignin
and hemicellulose as separate fractions, while reducing the costs
and complexity of the chemical recycling and still providing comparable
pulping results.12

Traditional sulfur-free
pulping methods, such as the soda (NaOH)
process, are very efficient in processing of annual plants such as
wheat straw. Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) has also
been used as an alkali to obtain comparable results when used in conjunction
with aqueous ethanol-based alkaline organosolv process. One example
of such a process involves impregnation of wheat straw in concentrated
solution of Na2CO3 followed by treatment with
hot gaseous ethanol, yielding a cellulose-rich material with a low
lignin content.13 Formic acid is another
interesting organosolv-type solvent that has been used to delignify
bamboo biomass efficiently in microwave-assisted extraction. However,
without irradiation, the delignification was incomplete.14 Formic acid has also been shown to promote the
cleavage of β-O-4-structure of oxidized lignin. The resulting
simple aromatic compounds could provide a stream of renewable aromatic
platform chemicals, solvents, and other useful aromatic compounds.15

Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have gained
lot of attention as “green” solvents
for biomass deconstruction and fractionation
because of their capability to dissolve biopolymers.16,17 Drawbacks with ILs include their high price and problems in recyclability
because of their nonvolatile nature. Even though distillable ILs have
been developed, and their prices have been significantly reduced over
the years, their estimated production costs remain relatively high.18 The potential of aqueous solution of protic
ILs for biomass processing has been discovered recently.19 This type of ILs (or their aqueous electrolyte
solutions) can have “self-cleaning properties” and their price can be close to common laboratory solvents
such as acetone or toluene.20

In
order to facilitate pulping, hot water extraction (HWE) has
been studied as potential pretreatment for delignification process.21 It is an intensive and quick extraction process,
which has been shown to release most of the hemicelluloses in lignocellulosic
biomass.22 Very recently, HWE of poplar
has been shown to result in only minor changes in the lignin structure
but still significantly decreases the cell wall recalcitrance.23 The method has been scaled up using the flow-through
system in the pilot scale for birch and spruce with high hemicellulose
yields.24

Microwave-assisted extractions
have been shown in several occasions
to increase the efficiency of biomass processing.25 Enzymatic digestibility of switchgrass has been increased
by utilizing microwaves instead of traditional heating.26 Microwaves generate the heat by direct interaction
with the heated material, which advantageously affect process times
and decrease energy inputs compared to traditional heating.27

In this paper, we studied processing of
wheat straw and aspen by
adopting various recently published methods including HWE pretreatment
and comparing those with traditional NaOH treatment utilizing a microwave
reactor for all procedures. Cellulose- and lignin-containing fractions
were isolated and analyzed by compositional analysis (e.g., acetylbromide
method and methanolysis), molecular weight distribution (MWD) analysis,
and structural analysis by NMR. We show that HWE enhances fractionation
of wheat straw and aspen into practically unaltered lignin together
with high molecular weight cellulose, which can be further refined.

Results and Discussion
The objective of the different
treatments was to produce materials
that can be efficiently valorized in order to utilize all the biomass
constituents in integrated biorefineries. After each treatment, isolated
hemicellulose fractions (A), cellulose fractions (C), and lignin fractions
(D) were separately analyzed using similar procedures to be able to
directly compare different treatment conditions (Figure 2). The yield and the composition
of the isolated fractions were determined to assess the performance
of the process. Structural characterization of resulting materials
can be used to evaluate their potential for further applications.

Figure 1 Changes
in the lignin phenylpropyl side-chain region with and without
HWE treated in mild organosolv conditions (5–6, wheat straw) and (14–15, aspen), and in formic
acid conditions (10–11 aspen). Carbohydrate signals
were weakened with HWE pretreatment.

Wheat Straw Hemicellulose Fraction (A)
Hemicellulose
content of original extractive-free wheat straw was determined to
be approx. 31% (w/w) by acid methanolysis. HWEs for wheat straw gave
an average yield of 16 wt % (w/w) for hemicellulose fraction (A),
which corresponds 53% of total hemicellulose content in untreated
wheat straw. The hemicellulose content in wheat straw mostly consisted
of xylose, arabinose, 4-O-Me-glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid,
and rhamnose originated from pectin (Table S4.1). HSQC-NMR spectra of fraction (A) indicated a significant hemicellulose
content with small amounts of lignin (Figure S8.1), which was evaluated to be 12% by Py–GC–MS.

Previously, HWE has been shown to increase the porosity of the cell
walls,28 enhancing accessibility of cooking
chemicals and effectivity of hydrolyzing enzymes in bioethanol production.
HWE induces autocatalytic reactions where hemicellulose acetyl groups
are partially released, resulting in formation of acidic conditions.29 Hemicelluloses of wheat straw and aspen consist
of xylan backbone with significant amount of acetylated units.30 Based on HSQC-NMR, HWE-treated samples (A) contained
acetyl signals at 2.0/20 ppm showing that acetyl groups survive in
HWE conditions (Figure S8.1). According
to literature, only basic conditions can release the majority of hemicellulose
acetyl-groups.31 In HWE conditions, thermally
labile hemicelluloses are simultaneously solubilized and degraded,
depending on the reaction conditions, to yield oligo- and monomeric
sugars. Mihiretu et al. showed that below 185 °C, only a small
amount of hemicellulose fractions were degraded to monomers, while
at higher temperatures and longer reaction times, more fragmented
sugars were formed.43 Gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) analysis of the fraction isolated after 5 min extraction at
185 °C showed bimodal MWD with high polydispersity, ranging from
0.5 to 50 kDa, which corresponds to weight average degree of polymerization
(DPW) 3–300 (Figure S2). The average hemicellulose DPW has been reported to
vary between 20 and 400,32,33 which suggests degradation
and solubilization of some fragments, and that the wheat straw hemicellulose
backbone was mostly left intact.

Wheat Straw Cellulose Fraction
Results of cooking treatments
for wheat straw and their impact on the yield of cellulose-rich fraction,
contents of residual lignin and ash, and DPW of cellulose
are presented in Table 1. Untreated extractive-free wheat straw contained 31% (w/w) hemicelluloses,
23% lignin, and 9% ash.

c Cellulose calculated
as 100% –
(hemicelluloses + lignin + ash)%.

Most of the pulping methods gave adequate cellulose
yields with
relatively low lignin contents. The ash contents, however, mainly
consisting of silicates, remained relatively high in all acidic, IL
(1–4) and mild alkaline (5–7) treatments, which may cause problems in further processing. Only
alkaline extractions (8–9) with high water content
seemed to efficiently remove silicates and other inorganics.

In formic acid and IL (triethylammonium hydrogen sulfate, [TEAH][HSO4]) treatments (1–4), HWE pretreatment
did not notably reduce the yields of cellulose fractions C, suggesting
that without HWE, most of the hemicelluloses end up in spent liquor
(Table 1). This is
confirmed by the fact that residual hemicellulose contents were not
notably reduced in comparison with HWE-treated samples (Table 1). HWE indeed seems to be a
rapid method to collect hemicelluloses as relatively pure fraction,
which is also supported by literature.21−24 As HWE was carried out at relatively
high temperature (185 °C), which can cause damage to the cellulosic
polymers, the MWDs of all cellulose fractions (C) were determined
by GPC.

The GPC chromatograms from cellulose fractions (Figure S1a) showed similar behavior for all cooks
in conventional
acidic conditions (1 and 2 with formic acid
and 8 using mild HCl). The MWDs of the carbohydrates
were slightly reduced, and the amount of low molecular weight part
was approximately half compared to caustic soda (NaOH) extraction
(9, Figure S1c). This is in
line with their residual hemicellulose contents (Table 1). The carbohydrate compositional
analysis revealed that acidic treatments removed almost all other
hemicellulose sugars except xylose and glucose (Table S4.1). Glucose can originate partially from cellulose
because acid methanolysis can depolymerize noncrystalline cellulose.
In alkaline conditions (5–7 and 9), the chromatograms have a bimodal structure including separate
lower and higher MW fractions with almost baseline separation. As
expected, the lower MW contained mostly hemicelluloses.34 The largest hemicellulose contents were found
in mildly alkaline organosolv treatments (5 and 7), which suggests that hemicelluloses were sparingly soluble
(Table 1). In alkaline
conditions, cellulose fractions (C) contained arabinose and 4-O-Me-glucuronic
acid (Table S4.1). In aqueous protic IL
cooks (3 and 4), the MWDs had one maximum
(Figure S1b), and the DPW values
were 1849 and 856, respectively. In all wheat straw experiments, HWE
pretreatment lowered the hemicellulose content but also reduced DPW of cellulose. The contribution of the HWE in removal of hemicelluloses
was either insignificant (2, 4) or large
(6) compared to corresponding experiments without the
HWE pretreatment (1, 3, 5).
The residual hemicelluloses in fraction C were predominantly xylose
and glucose, according to methanolysis. Sample dissolution procedure
in the GPC analysis for carbohydrates is commonly used for cellulosic
pulp samples. In present study, the dissolution was not complete but
this likely has no major effect on DPW values.

Wheat Straw Lignin Fraction
Isolation of lignin from
biomass modifies its natural structure, depending on the severity
of the treatment. Structural changes together with impurities that
travel with lignin affect further reactivity, for example, in depolymerization
reactions. The most important structure in lignin is β-O-4-ether
linkage, which typically enables chemical modification through the
free benzylic hydroxyl groups in lignin backbone (e.g., esterification,
etherification, crosslinking, copolymerization, and oxidation) later
in the biorefinery process stream.6 Structural
characteristics and lignin quality were assessed by HSQC-NMR. Full
area spectra of all samples and selected 13C NMR spectra
are presented in Figures S3 and S4. The
signals of β-O-4-ether linkage in HSQC are found at 6.1/74.2
and 4.6/80.5 ppm for phenylpropanoid side-chain Cα and Cβ
positions, respectively.35 Carbohydrates
were identified by the anomeric carbon signal at 4.5/100.3 ppm. Yields,
molecular weight averages, and qualitative analysis of lignin fractions
(D) are in Table 2.

Formic acid treatment was found to derivatize lignin
chemically
shown by the presence of formate ester signals at 8.1/160 ppm in the
HSQC NMR spectra. The labile formate groups improve lignin solubility,
which can be advantageous for processing. The IL procedures (3–4) yielded highly soluble lignin with the nonexistent
β-O-4-ether structure. Treatment with NaOH (9)
produced poorly soluble lignin in acetylation. The HSQC of the soluble
part contained strong signals for β-O-4 and carbohydrates, suggesting
the presence of lignin–carbohydrate complexes (LCCs).36,37

Interestingly, HWE pretreatment decreased the lignin yield
(Table 2) in all treatments
except in mild alkaline organosolv conditions (6). The
increased lignin yield was accompanied by reduction in hemicellulose
signals in HSQC (Figure 1). This suggests that by removing
the hemicelluloses by HWE pretreatment, alkali is able to permeate
the cell wall more easily and enhance lignin dissolution. According
to HSQC, the lignin β-O-4-signals in wheat straw fractions (D)
remained strong except in IL treatments. Carbohydrates were mostly
absent in all HWE-pretreated samples (2, 4, and 6, Table 2).

The average molecular weight of each lignin fraction
(D) was analyzed
by GPC (Figure S5). The HWE pretreatment
reduced Mw by 15% when combined with acidic
cooking in formic acid (1–2) and by 10% in IL
(3–4). The IL treatment provided the narrowest
distribution indicating most uniform product. The mild acid treatment
followed by mild alkali (8) showed similar Mw-value compared to HWE and formic acid treated sample
(2). In mild alkaline organosolv conditions, HWE did
not affect molecular mass distribution of lignin fractions (D) (5–6). The MWDs in general were very similar with all
alkaline treatments by NaOH and Na2CO3 (5–7). The soda-treated lignin (9) had
slightly lower MW than the alkaline organosolv-cooked samples.

Because delignification of wheat straw was almost complete with
nearly all cooking procedures, in order to produce an effective process,
the main parameters to consider are cellulose fraction yield and lignin
fraction purity. With that in mind, the mild organosolv with Na2CO3 combined with HWE pretreatment is the superior
process, where both yield and purity of the lignin fraction increased
without affecting the MWD.

Aspen Hemicellulose Fraction (A)
Approximate the hemicellulose
content of extractive-free aspen was determined to be 31% (w/w). HWE
for aspen gave hemicellulose fraction in an average yield of 25 wt
% (w/w), corresponding to 82% of total hemicelluloses. HWE treatment
produced hemicellulose fraction with only 5% lignin evaluated by Py–GC–MS
and HSQC-NMR. According to GPC results of hemicellulose fractions,
aspen HWE extraction gave structurally more uniform product without
the higher MW part present in wheat straw hemicellulose fraction.
The observed hemicellulose MW range was 0.5–8 kDa (DPW 3–50) with notably smaller Mw of 1.5 kDa compared to wheat straw (8 kDa) (Table S3). The smaller Mw, lack
of lignin fragments in the Py-GC-MS and HSQC-signals (Figure S8.2), suggests that aspen cell wall morphology
allows easier separation of its components than wheat straw.

Aspen Cellulose Fraction
Hemicellulose and lignin contents
for aspen cellulose fraction are in Table 3. Ash contents were not measured, as there
are insignificant amounts of inorganics in aspen. Extractive-free
aspen was determined to contain 31% (w/w) hemicelluloses and 19% lignin.

Aspen, a woody biomass, was more resistant to chemical
deconstruction
than wheat straw. Formic acid and IL procedures (10–13, Table 3) yielded
cellulose fractions (C) with low lignin contents while alkaline extractions
(14–18, Table 3) resulted in low delignification. Furthermore, in
alkaline conditions, the isolated cellulose fractions contained small
amounts of arabinose, rhamnose, and uronic acids (Table S4.2). HWE before organosolv treatment (15) removed most of other sugars except xylose and glucose. The cellulose
fractions after treatments 17 and 18 (Table 3) had the highest
lignin content, which suggests removal of mostly hemicelluloses during
the procedure.

HWE pretreatment lowered slightly cellulose fraction
(C) yield
in formic acid procedure (10–11), which indicates
that without HWE, most of the hemicelluloses dissolved in the cooking
liquor similar to wheat straw treatments. In the case of the IL solutions
(12 and 13, Table 3), the yields were around 35%, but the overall
cellulose yield and DPW were low compared to other treatments.
HWE seemed to improve pulping in mild organosolv (15),
however, the lignin content in fraction C remained relatively high
(Table 3).

MWDs
in aspen cellulose fractions (C) were determined by GPC. HWE
reduced substantially the DPW of aspen cellulose (Table 3, Figure S1d–f). This was in line with previous study,
which showed reduction of the cell wall recalcitrance of poplar by
reducing the cellulose DP when hydrothermal treatment was performed.23 Treatments in acidic conditions (10, 11 and 17) produced reduced DPs with
large PDIs (Figure S1d–f). In alkaline
treatments without HWE (14, 16, and 18), chromatograms showed a bimodal shape, which is indication
of both hemicelluloses and cellulose in the sample. HWE pretreatment
with organosolv (15) removed the low MW fraction with
concomitant induction of cellulose hydrolysis. Overall, the largest
DPW for cellulose (Table S2)
was obtained with the alkaline cooks. The IL treatments had the smallest
DPW (12–13), approximately one-third
of the highest DPW value (18) in soda-cooking
conditions. This suggests that cellulose was degraded during the treatments
presumably because the solution was strongly acidic. This was the
case in most of the acidic treatments (11, 17, Table 3). It is
noteworthy that the IL treatment produced relatively clean cellulose
fractions. The cellulose produced this way may be used in enzymatic
bioethanol production because reduced DPW allows for more
efficient reactions with cellulases.38

Aspen Lignin Fraction
Aspen lignin fractions were collected
following the same procedure that was used for wheat straw. Yields,
molecular weight averages, and qualitative analysis of the lignin
fractions are in Table 4.

NMR results (Figures S6 and S7) were
very similar between the two starting materials with the exception
of carbohydrates, and the amount of which was lower in aspen lignin
fractions (D). The IL treatment (12 and 13) caused the β-O-4-structure signals to disappear, while other
procedures left the structure practically intact (Figure S6). The side-chain structures were hydrolyzed because
of the highly acidic conditions in the protic IL. Soda treatment (18) yielded lignin fraction with low solubility, which most
likely indicates the presence of hemicelluloses similar to wheat straw
experiment (9).

Pretreatment with HWE lowered Mw of
aspen lignin in case of formic acid by 20% (10 and 11) or IL treatments by 28% (12 and 13) as shown by GPC analysis (Table 5). All these chromatograms showed a single maximum,
and distributions were narrower with HWE-treated samples. The IL-treated
samples (12 and 13) had lower average molecular
sizes and PDI than formic acid-treated samples (10 and 11) indicating lignin degradation in highly acidic conditions.
With mild organosolv conditions (14 and 16), the curve was bimodal but 16 contained fewer low-MW
and more high-MW components pointing to the presence of LCCs. Interestingly,
in carbonate organosolv with HWE (15), the MWD had one
clear maximum with larger molecular mass component removed suggesting
removal of hemicelluloses.

The results clearly demonstrate that with aspen, formic
acid cooks produced the highest
degree of delignification
(Table 3), even though
after the treatment lignin was not completely recovered by water precipitation.
The HWE improved yields of dissolved lignins in alkaline organosolv
conditions with both biomasses, but no improvement was observed with
soda cook. The results also suggest that alkaline cooking is not able
to create pores in the cell wall without HWE pretreatment to assist
penetration of solvents and reagents into the cell wall (Tables 4 and 5). This is in
good agreement with the results obtained by Duarte et al. 2011, who
demonstrated similar effect of HWE pretreatment on hardwood kraft
pulp fibers.28 To confirm the role of HWE
for alkaline cooking, additional experiments were made (Table 5) to study the effect of higher
alkali concentration (1 M) in the yield and constitution of lignin
fraction (D). These experiments confirmed that the lignin yields increased
when alkaline organosolv cook was combined with HWE.

More purified
lignin fraction is preferred for further processing
because carbohydrate impurities likely cause problems, for example,
in modification reactions by hindering solubility6,39 The
most complete separation of the biomass to the cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin was accomplished with the combination of formic acid and
HWE both for aspen and wheat straw.

Conclusions
In this study, the effect of HWE was examined
as a pretreatment
method when several potential pulping procedures for modern biorefineries
were compared to traditional soda cooking, using wheat straw and aspen
as starting biomaterials. For practical reasons, experiments were
performed applying microwaves as the heat source. Especially, HWE
was applied to examine the separation of carbohydrates and lignin
in the cooks.

For both biomasses, HWE pretreatment produced
relatively pure and
uniform hemicellulose fraction that can be further used, for example,
for chemicals and advanced material development. While this hemicellulose
fraction in wheat straw had noticeable lignin component, aspen hemicellulose
fraction barely contained detectable amounts of lignin. Hemicellulose
fractions also had some unusual properties, such as small molecular
weight and tendency to dissolve in organic solvents, for example,
acetone. This facilitates modification of hemicellulosic materials
and enables their application as value-added components in food additives
and pharmaceutical products because they have been produced without
toxic or harmful chemicals.

The HWE pretreatment also had a
positive effect on further separation
of lignin and cellulose in active cooks. It improved yields and purity
of lignin fractions in alkaline ethanol organosolv cook with both
biomasses. Interestingly, when HWE was applied to carbonate organosolv
cook, considered as environmentally cost-efficient and sustainable
method, reasonable delignification was obtained in wheat straw. On
the other hand, in combination with formic acid cook, HWE pretreatment
facilitated production of clean lignin fraction with almost completely
delignified cellulose fraction. In fact, the formic acid treatments
enable impressive delignification results for both biomasses regardless
of the HWE pretreatment. Our findings demonstrate that a separate
HWE is especially efficient in alkaline organosolv cooks.

The
enhanced efficiency of separating the wood components by HWE
allows the separation of the biomass into all main components of the
plant cell wall (hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin) with minimal
effects on their structural composition. Most of the pulping methods
examined retained the lignin native structure, which is promising
for lignin utilization in further chemical processing. This potentially
creates new business opportunities for biorefineries using agricultural
wastes such as wheat straw. The research is particularly topical,
considering the recent efforts to support circular bioeconomy and
bio-based innovations.

Experimental Section
Biomass Feedstock
Wheat straw was received from southern
Finland as 10–30 cm long stems. Remaining chaffs were removed
by hand, and the stems were fed to Wiley mini-mill (Thomas Scientific)
to pass 60 mesh. Extractives were removed from wheat straw with EtOH
and CHCl3:MeOH at room temperature (detailed procedure
in S1.1).

The naturally grown aspen was 23–24 year-old
wood with 7 cm diameter at breast height from southern Finland. The
Aspen was collected as wood and subsequently processed to sawdust
to simulate logging residues. Aspen sawdust was first sterilized by
briefly immersing at 90 °C in distilled water and washed with
acetone and finally dried in oven at 50 °C. The sterilized sawdust
was then fed to Wiley mill to pass 60 mesh. Extractives were removed
with acetone overnight (detailed procedure in S1.1).

Biomass Treatments
Selected treatment processes were
adopted into a microwave-assisted procedure using Biotage Initiator
2.0 and Anton Parr Monowave 450 microwave reactors in reported optimized
conditions. A silicon carbide reaction vessel was used in higher alkalinities.
The general scheme is presented in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Scheme on fractionation procedures on the biomass.

In HWE, 1.0 g of wheat straw or aspen powder was
extracted with
distilled water (5 min at 185 °C). Solids were filtrated and
washed with distilled water, dried, and subjected to a selected delignification
procedure, according to Table 6. The aqueous solution was collected and evaporated to yield
hemicellulose fraction A.

Aqueous formic acid,40 dilute
HCl followed
by dilute NaOH,41 aqueous IL triethylammonium
hydrogen sulfate ([TEAH][HSO4]),20 alkaline organosolv,42 and HWE43 procedures were compared to a traditional NaOH
extraction using the same instrument. Experiments 1–9 were
performed on wheat straw and experiments 10–22 with aspen.

General procedure for biomass treatment: mixture of 1.0 g extractive-free
wheat straw or aspen powder after HWE or straight after removal of
extractives in a microwave reactor vial with 20 mL solvent was placed
into the reactor with magnetic stirring. After reaction, the solids
were separated by vacuum filtration and washed with the compatible
solvent to produce fraction C in Figure 1. Lignin was collected from the liquid fractions
(fraction D in Figure 1). Alkaline solutions were acidified, lignin was left to coagulate
overnight, and the solids were filtrated. From the formic acid solution,
lignin was isolated by concentrating to few milliliters and then adding
it drop-wise to 40 mL of distilled water. In IL procedure, the solutions
of [TEAH][HSO4] were diluted with ethanol before filtration
(fraction C) to reduce viscosity. The liquids were evaporated to remove
volatiles, diluted to 80 mL with distilled water, and left to coagulate
overnight to recover fraction D.

Hemicellulose Carbohydrate Composition
Hemicelluloses
in extractive-free wheat straw and aspen and residual hemicelluloses
in cellulose fractions C were analyzed by acid methanolysis.44 Details of the analysis method are presented
in Supporting Information S1.2. Samples
were analyzed with gas chromatography (GC) using Shimadzu GC-2010
(Shimadzu, Japan) GC with HP-1 column (25 m, 0.2 mm, 0.11 μm).
Amount of sugars in samples is presented as anhydrosugars.

Lignin Content Analysis
The lignin content was analyzed
from fractions C with the acetyl bromide method, according to Hatfield
et al.,45 detailed procedure in S1.3.

Lignin NMR Characterization
A Bruker AVANCE III 500
MHz FT-NMR-spectrometer with the BBFO broadband probe was used for
all experiments. Details of analysis method are given in S1.4. Samples were acetylated and dissolved in
CDCl3. Spectra were processed using Bruker TopSpin 3.5pl7.

MWD Analysis
Lignin samples: GPC measurements were
performed according to Marinović et al.46 on Waters ACQUITY APC equipment using Acquity APCTM XT
45 Å (1.7 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm) and XT 200 Å (2.5
μm, 4.6 × 150 mm) columns (Waters Corporation, USA). GPC
Empower Software (Waters) was used for data processing to obtain Mn (number-average molecular weight), Mw (weight-average molecular weight) and polydispersity
PDI (Mw/Mn). Chromatograms were normalized.

Carbohydrate samples: measurements
were performed with Agilent Infinity 1260 LC-system with a refractive
index detector from the Agilent 1200 series. Separation was made with
a precolumn (Agilent PLgel guard 50 × 7.5 mm) and three analytical
columns (PLgel Mixed B, 10 μm, 300 × 7.5 mm). Sample preparation
for cellulosic samples was made according to Kakko et al.47 Agilent GPC add-on was used for calculations.
Weight average degree of polymerization (DPw) of cellulose
was calculated by Mw/AGU (anhydro glucose
unit = 162 g mol–1). Details of analysis methods
are given in S1.5.

Ash Content Analysis
Ash contents in wheat straw samples
were determined by thermally oxidizing the samples in a muffler oven
at 600 °C and measuring material loss.48 Details of the analysis method are given in S1.6.

Pyrolysis–GC–MS Analysis
Pyrolab2000
(Pyrolab, Sweden) analytical-scale equipment directly connected to
Bruker Scion SQ456-GC/MS equipped with an Agilent DB-5MS UI (5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane,
30 m × 0.250 mm × 0.25 μm l m) capillary column was
used for analysis. HWE-extracted fractions (A) were analyzed, and
