The ability of capturing metals and/or
radionuclides from large
amounts of water is important for radioisotope waste treatment and
environmental cleanup. We have developed an approach that rapidly
optimizes the capturing of radioisotopes in large-volume aqueous environments.
The approach was scaled up to capture beryllium-7 from 300 gallons
of cooling water associated with a linear accelerator. Solid supports
with the functional groups sulfonic acid, iminodiacetate, pyridine
amine, pyridine amine acid, or quaternary amine were incubated in
the cooling water for 1 week. One sulfonic acid solid support was
able to capture 2.1 mCi of Be-7. Subsequent studies with the sulfonic
acid solid support focused on the uptake over time of Be-7, scale-up
of capturing Be-7, and subsequent purification of Be-7. The uptake
over time of Be-7 was found to be linear in the first 24 h, with an
equation of Y = 4.11X (% uptake/time
(h)) (R2 = 0.998). The uptake of Be-7
reached the maximum at 24 h and was identical to the uptake at 168
h. To purify Be-7, the optimal purification approach was to release
the Be-7 from the solid support with 10 M HCl, which could be immediately
passed through an AG1 resin to remove radioimpurities. The radiopurity
of the purified Be-7 was greater than 99%, and this method was used
to purify 65 mCi of the isotope.

1 Introduction
Michigan
State University’s Facility for Rare Ion Beams
(FRIB) is currently being built and will be online in ∼2018.1,2 One mission of the facility is radioisotope production and harvesting
of radioactive metal ions from thousands of gallons of water. Capturing
or harvesting of important radioisotopes from hundreds of gallons
of cooling water represents an interesting scientific challenge. The
water conditions cannot be optimized for maximum retention of an isotope.
Setting up massive (50+ gallon) ion-exchange columns for routine purification
of important radioisotopes is not practical. Cooling water at FRIB
will have a flow rate of 25 gallons/min, which presents another challenge
for capturing radioisotopes.3

Similar
challenges were faced at Brookhaven National Lab’s
LINAC Isotope Producer (BLIP) to capture beryllium-7 (Be-7) from more
than 300 gallons of cooling water. Be-7 is produced in the cooling
water at BLIP in a C-12(p,x) Be-7
nuclear reaction. Be-7 has a half-life of 53.28 days and is used for
environmental studies.4 Purification of
Be-7 is typically carried out after the isotope run season, and BLIP
cooling water has an accumulated beam time in excess of 150 days.
The National Isotope Development Center manages and coordinates the
sale of Be-7, and the Be-7 product specifications are radiopurity
99%, in a radiochemical concentration of greater than 1 mCi/mL in
1 M HCl.5

A traditional approach
to purify Be-7 from BLIP cooling water was
to remove 10–20 gallons of BLIP water and then use ion-exchange
resins to concentrate and purify the isotope. The water was moved
to the target processing lab and pumped through a 5–10 mL column
of Chelex 100 resin. During the process, blue bands appear as a result
of either cobalt or copper. Be-7 was then removed from the column
with strong acids, and subsequent purification was performed to remove
radioimpurities. Handling the BLIP cooling water can be cumbersome,
lead to contamination, and exposure of higher doses to the isotope
production staff. Although this approach worked for small production
quantities less than 20 mCi, some scientists have requested 100+ mCi
of Be-7. An approach utilizing ion-exchange resins would be hard to
implement on a large scale, and the approach will also lead to increased
radiation dose and personnel time. In this research, we present a
novel approach to optimize the capture of radiometals utilizing multiple
functionalized solid supports with metal capturing groups. The solid
support approach is ideal for capturing radioactivity from large volumes
(>100 gallons) of water and could easily be adapted to capture
radioisotopes
and/or toxic metals from contaminated cooling pools and other waste
streams.

2 Experimental Hypotheses/Study Design
To overcome these challenges, we synthesized and evaluated different
metal capturing groups on the surface of SynPhase Lanterns (solid
supports) to capture radioisotopes from the BLIP cooling water. SynPhase
Lanterns (17 mm × 6 mm) are used in organic/peptide synthesis,
combinatorial chemistry, and to scavenge impurities during organic
synthesis.6−8 Technology developed for applications allow the SynPhase
Lanterns to be tagged for easy identification of surface groups.9 The split-pool approaches developed for combinatorial
chemistry were used by purification chemists to rapidly determine
the best purification conditions for a particular radioisotope or
metal.

The studies described herein represent the first time
that SynPhase
Lanterns have been used to harvest/purify radioactive metal ions,
and they provide a tremendous amount of flexibility to purification
chemists. Figure 1 outlines
the study design used to develop a purification approach of a radioisotope
from large bodies of water. In step A, the best metal capturing group
for a particular radioisotope was determined. Briefly, multiple SynPhase
Lanterns with different metal capturing groups were simultaneously
incubated in the radioisotope containing water, removed, processed
separately, and the uptake/retention of radioisotopes and nonradioactive
metals was determined for each SynPhase Lantern. In step B, multiple
SynPhase Lanterns with the optimal capturing group were used to capture
large amounts of the desired radioisotope or nonradioactive metal.
During this step, a timed study was performed to determine the optimal
time of incubation. Briefly, one SynPhase Lantern was removed at various
time points, processed, and the retained radioisotope and nonradioactive
metals were quantified. In step C, the optimal elution solvent was
determined. Briefly, some of the incubated SynPhase Lanterns from
step B were separated, incubated with different solvents, and the
eluted radioisotopes and nonradioactive metals were determined. This
approach was coupled with traditional ion-exchange resins for the
purification of a radioisotope to meet the purity requirements associated
with the application. This approach allowed the rapid development
of the optimal purification process and incorporated scale-up to capture
larger quantities of radioactive metals.

Figure 1 Study Design: split-pool
techniques were used to optimize the purification
approach to determine the best functional group on the solid support
to capture a specific metal (A), then scale-up (B) and/or testing
solutions to determine optimal release conditions (C). Briefly: (A)
the five different solid supports were incubated with a metal containing
solution and then separated; a solvent was used to release the metals
from the solid supports, and the metals were quantified. (B) Large-scale
uptake with the multiple solid supports with the best uptake. (C)
To optimize the release of the metal from the solid support, the solid
supports were processed separately with different solvents. Then,
the optimized purification approach can be used with all of the solid
supports to purify the metal of interest.

3 Results and Discussion
Capturing radionuclides
and metals from large bodies of water presents
problems as traditional approaches circulate the liquid through an
ion-exchange resin. This study evaluated capturing Be-7 from the BLIP
cooling water and purifying Be-7, so it could be available to the
research community. The goal of the study was not the complete removal
of Be-7 from the cooling water. This might be achievable by repeatedly
using the ∼40 sulfonic acid solid supports, using more solid
supports, or using larger solid supports with more functional groups.
Capturing and removing Be-7 from the 300 gallons of BLIP cooling water
by simply lowering the solid supports into the water present many
advantages for removing isotopes or other metals from large pools
of water. Various research projects are evaluating the ability of
functionalized SynPhase Lanterns of purifying radioactive metals from
irradiated targets and cooling water. All modified solid supports
used in the studies were synthesized from the same batch of aminomethylated
SynPhase Lanterns. The different functional groups on the solid supports
were synthesized and confirmed by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier
transform infrared (ATR-FT-IR).15,19 The capacities of the
iminodiacetate, pyridine amine, and pyridine amine acid for cobalt
were 9.4 ± 0.2, 4.1 ± 0.4, and 5.1 ± 0.1 mg/solid support
(n = 3), respectively. Cobalt was used to determine
the capacity of various functionalized solid supports as the metal
is a representative metal for the different studies currently being
evaluated. The differences in capacity of the functionalized solid
supports may reflect the overall charge of the cobalt moiety that
is retained on the surface. The diacid groups of the iminodiacetate
solid support would form a neutral cobalt moiety on the surface. This
should reduce charge repulsion between the surface of the solid support
that captured the cobalt and the positively charged cobalt in solution.
Both pyridine-modified solid supports would lead to a positive charged
surface when cobalt is complexed. This could result in charge repulsion
between the cobalt-modified solid support surface and the incoming
positively charged cobalt species in solution and result in lower
capacity. The capacity of the quaternary amine for zinc was 23.5 ±
3.1 mg/solid support (n = 3). Zinc was chosen for
the capacity study because quaternary amines have high affinity for
zinc in 2 M HCl.10,11 Capacity studies with copper
can be problematic as complete removal of all of the copper from the
solid supports was difficult.

A plastic target box was made
that held multiple solid supports
(>100) and fit in the target holder at BLIP (Figure 2). The objective of the experiments was divided
into four parts. First was to examine the uptake of Be-7 and other
isotopes in the cooling water on solid supports containing the following
metal capturing groups: sulfonic acid, iminodiacetate, quaternary
amine, pyridine amine, and pyridine amine acid (Figures 1A and 3). This collection
of functional groups on the solid supports represents a strong cation
resin (sulfonic acid), Chelex 100 (iminodiacetate), anion-exchange
(quaternary amine) resins, and two nontraditional resins. These metal
capturing groups should possess properties to capture most metals
from solutions. Second, a time versus uptake of Be-7 study was conducted
with the sulfonic acid solid support. Third, a large-scale study was
performed using multiple sulfonic acid solid supports to capture a
large amount of Be-7 on the solid support (Figure 1B). Fourth was to determine the best solvent
to selectively remove Be-7 from the solid support (Figure 1C).

Different quantities of metals
(mg) and radionuclides (μCi)
in the BLIP cooling water, retained on the different functionalized
solid supports and in the purified Be-7, are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The 300 gallons of cooling water contained 431 mCi of Be,
and the concentration was ∼1.66 mCi/gallon. One sulfonic acid
solid support was able to capture 2.11 mCi of Be-7 with ∼93%
radiopurity, and none of the other functionalized solid supports captured
more than 0.5 mCi. All solid supports had a higher uptake of Be-7
than that of any other isotope, but the pyridine amine functionalized
solid support had the highest uptake of vanadium (V-48). The sulfonic
acid functionalized solid support had no uptake of V-48. All proceeding
experiments were conducted with the sulfonic acid functionalized solid
support. The uptake of Be-7 over time was determined to be linear
with the following equation: Y = 4.11X (% uptake/time (h)) (R2 = 0.998). The
amount of Be-7 captured at 24 h was the same as the amount of Be-7
captured for the one week study.

a Nb, Be, Fe, and the empty cells
indicate that the metal was below the published quantification limit.10 Analysis by inductively coupled plasma-optical
emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

In the initial study, the iminodiacetate and sulfonic acid solid
supports were both aqua blue after incubation in the BLIP target cooling
water.12 ICP-OES analysis of the captured
metals indicated 3.1 mg of copper and 2.3 mg of nickel per sulfonic
acid solid support. The aqua blue color on the solid supports is the
result of concentrating nickel and copper onto the surface of the
solid support. The higher levels of copper in the BLIP water are the
result of a copper beam stop. Nickel in the BLIP water is the result
of using high nickel content Inconel target bodies for production
of various isotopes. The release of the metals was rapid in 10 M HCl,
and the color was removed from the solid supports surface within 15
s.12 The sulfonic acid solid supports captured
more elements in higher quantities that did the other solid supports.
Gallium had uptake on all solid supports and was the element captured
in the highest quantities for pyridine functionalized and quaternary
amine solid supports. The pyridine functionalized and quaternary amine
solid supports had very little uptake of other elements.

The
“used” solid supports that captured Be-7 were
used with HCl and ammonium chloride to evaluate the best elution solvent.
Both solvent systems were able to displace Be-7 from the solid supports
in varying amounts with similar purity that ranged from 88 to 95%,
so a second cleanup column would be required to meet Department of
Energy (DOE) specifications for Be-7.5 A
separation utilizing 15 mL of 1 M HCl released 94% of the Be-7 from
the solid support, and the remaining Be-7 was released with a second
15 mL incubation. The impure Be-7 required a second cleanup column,
so it became advantageous to elute Be-7 from the sulfonic acid solid
support with 10 M HCl, which could be directly loaded on an AG1 resin.
Loading the green solution on the resin resulted in a green band retained
at the top of the resin. The resin was rinsed with 10 M HCl, and the
activity and purity in the eluted load (10 M HCl) and rinse solutions
of 10 M HCl were 1.05 mCi (99.6%), 0.514 mCi (99.38%), and 0.09 mCi
(96.8%), respectively. The yield for the pooled solutions was 90%
with an acceptable purity (99%). The retention of Be-7 on new, used,
and crushed sulfonic acid solid supports was 2.11, 1.62, and 1.52
mCi/solid support, respectively. The comparable values indicate that
the solid supports can be reused for capturing radioactivity. The
10 M HCl solutions used to release the radioactivity from the three
different sulfonic acid solid support groups were combined. The green
solution required two 10 mL AG1 columns to purify the Be-7 and remove
the green color from the solution. The purified Be-7 solution meets
DOE specifications, and 65 mCi of Be-7 was purified. These approaches
were used to reduce the overall development time for the purification
process from 3 months to less than 3 weeks. The approach was able
to capture large quantities of radioisotopes and could be easily scaled
up by increasing the amount of solid supports.

4 Environmental
Implications
Ion-exchange chromatography has long been used
for the purification
of charged species from waste streams, radioisotope production, harvesting
or capturing radioactive metal ions, and removal of toxic metals from
water sources. To date, most approaches have been focusing on using
ion-exchange resins in a column chromatography approach to remove
metals of interest. However, this approach can be problematic with
large volumes of water when both positive and negative charged species
are present. The ability of capturing radioactive metals from a large
body of water has always been an issue for radioactive waste associated
with cooling systems and storage pools for nuclear reactors.13

It is not practical to pass large amounts
of water through ion-exchange
columns to clean up large bodies of water contaminated with metals
or radioactivity. For some systems, elaborate redesigns of the system
to allow capturing metals or radioactivity are not possible or economically
practical. In this work, we evaluated a new approach to capture radioactivity
from large bodies of water, and the approach can be easily adapted
to various systems.

Optimizing the characteristics of contaminated
water for best metal
uptake by a resin or solid support is not practical in many instances.
The approach used in this paper represents a process that could be
used to remove metals from any contaminated aqueous environment. The
solid supports used in the studies have a polystyrene core and are
designed for applications in organic solvents.8 They should be able to capture toxic metals and/or radioactive metals
from mixed waste streams. The approach would start with first identifying
the best functional group(s) on the solid support to capture the metal
of interest. Once the optimal functional group to capture a specific
metal is determined, large-scale purification or decontamination would
be performed either by purchasing or synthesizing large amounts of
the solid support with the desired functional group(s) or by reusing
the solid supports. Reusing the solid supports could drastically reduce
the cost for large-scale processes, making some decontamination efforts
more affordable. For other applications, the solid supports could
be used to capture toxins, toxic metals, or radioactive metals from
liquid waste streams, after which the solid supports could be disposed
of as solid waste.

The flexibility of the approach to use multiple
different functional
groups on the solid supports should allow for the capture of metals
that are present as different species and/or charges. The solid supports
can be used in both aqueous and organic environments, which could
allow decontamination of mixed hazardous radioactive waste streams.
One major advantage of solid supports over resins is when insoluble
materials are present. Because the solid supports are capturing the
metals on the surface, the presence of insoluble materials should
have minimal impact on the process. Solutions with insoluble materials
clog the resin columns and would require filtration of the solution
prior to addition to a column. Thus, to remove radionuclides and/or
metals from large volumes, the solid support method outlined herein
should be superior to methods involving traditional resins.

5 Experimental Section
The sulfonic acid and amine SynPhase
Lanterns were purchased from
Mimetopes (Australia). Type A SynPhase Lanterns were used, and the
surface area was 7.2 cm2. The literature value for the
capacity of the sulfonic acid SynPhase Lantern was 300 μmol/solid
support. The literature value for the capacity of the aminomethylated
SynPhase Lantern was 250 μmol. The solid support was used to
prepare solid supports with iminodiacetate, pyridine amine, pyridine
amine acid, or quaternary amine functional groups. Chemicals used
in the synthesis of the metal capturing groups on the SynPhase Lanterns
were purchased from Sigma Aldrich or Fischer Scientific. A Thermo
Scientific Nicolet iS50 FT-IR with a built-in diamond ATR detector
was used for IR analysis of modified SynPhase Lanterns. Inductively
coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) standards were
purchased from SPEX CertiPrep. ICP-OES and γ spectroscopy analyses
were conducted using previously published methods.14 γ ray analysis was performed on a calibrated high-purity
germanium detector, and an analysis library was set up for isotopes
in the BLIP water.15 Analysis of 3 mL of
BLIP cooling water provided an estimate of the total activity of each
of the radionuclides. In the scale-up experiment, three types of sulfonic
acid SynPhase Lanterns were used: new, used, and crushed. The used
SynPhase Lanterns had been used previously for multiple metal retention
studies.16,17 The crushed SynPhase Lanterns had been used
in other metal studies where surface analysis was conducted with ATR-FT-IR
and resulted in crushing of the SynPhase Lanterns surface.17 Metals were removed from 29 previously used
and crushed SynPhase Lanterns by incubation in 5 or 6 M HNO3 and/or HCl for 2–24 h and then incubated first in boiling
0.05 M Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (pH = 5.5) for 20 min and
then water for 24 h. The plastic target box to hold the solid supports
was three-dimensional printed from acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene
(ABS) with 0.1″ wide slots, and the ABS can withstand 108 rad γ dose.18

5.1 Synthesis and Characterization of Functional
Groups on SynPhase Lanterns
SynPhase Lanterns with the functional
groups iminodiacetate, pyridine amine, pyridine amine acid, and quaternary
amine were synthesized according to procedures similar to previously
published methods.19 Functional groups
were characterized by attenuated total reflectance-FT-IR and by capacity
testing. The following procedure modifications were made. The pyridine
amine functionalized solid supports were prepared with 2.5 mol excess
of 2-pyridine-carboxaldehyde. The shift base solid support intermediate
was yellow-brown compared with the yellow solid support associated
with the starting amine and reduced pyridine amine. The observed colors
are consistent with the synthesis of similar shift base compounds
from the literature.19 The pyridine amine
acid functionalized solid supports were prepared with a 2.5 mol excess
of bromoacetic acid. The iminodiacetate functionalized solid supports
were prepared with a 5 mol excess of bromoacetic acid. The quaternary
amine solid supports were synthesized by adding 10 mL of methyl iodine
to the primary amine solid support. The reaction was spun for 1 week,
the solution was removed, and the solid supports were purified. Purification: The functionalized solid supports were removed,
placed in 2 mL × 10 mL of ethanol for 20 min, removed again,
and then repeated with 2 mL × 20 mL of water. Capacity
Study: An excess amount of cobalt chloride was used to saturate
the binding ability of the functional groups on the surface of the
solid supports. This data was used to determine the number of binding
sites/functional groups or capacity per solid support. To a vial was
added ∼1 gram of cobalt chloride, and the solid was dissolved
in 20 mL of 0.5 M ammonium acetate with pH 6. Three pyridine amine
solid supports were added to the beaker, and the solution was stirred
for 4 days. The maroon solid supports were removed and placed in 20
mL of 0.5 M ammonium acetate with pH 6 for 20 min. The solid supports
were removed and dried by rolling the solid support on a chemwipe.
The chemwipe remained white with no visual signs of red/pink from
cobalt. To remove the cobalt from the surface, each solid support
was added to 4 mL of 4 M nitric acid and incubated for 1 h; then,
10 μL was removed, added to 4 mL of 2% nitric acid, and the
cobalt was quantified by ICP-OES. The same method was used to determine
the capacity for iminodiacetate and pyridine amine acid solid supports.
A similar capacity study was performed for the quaternary amine solid
support, but zinc in 2 M HCl was used to saturate the sites on the
solid support. The zinc was released from the solid support in 3 mL
of 0.001 M nitric acid, and the zinc was quantified by ICP-OES.

5.2 Determination of Uptake of Be-7 and Other
Isotopes on Solid Supports
Figure 2 outlines the target assembly with the target
box containing the solid supports. The BLIP water flow was 31.6 gallons/min,
with a supply pressure of 32.6 PSI, and the water temperature was
15.5 °C. Color-coded stems were used to identify the different
solid supports. In the initial study, 15 iminodiacetate solid supports
and one solid support of the sulfonic acid, pyridine amine, pyridine
amine acid, and quaternary amine were used (Figure 1a). The solid supports were kept in the cooling
water for 1 week and removed; γ spectroscopy of the solid supports
was conducted to determine the initial metals on the surface. The
metals were removed from the iminodiacetate solid supports by incubation
in 2 mL × 30 mL of 5 M HNO3, and the sulfonic acid,
pyridine amine, pyridine amine acid, and quaternary amine solid supports
were each processed separately with 2 mL × 10 mL of 5 M HNO3. The solutions were evaporated, the residues were redissolved
in 0.1 M HCl, and the activity of the radionuclides was determined.
The solid supports were checked for radioactivity with a dose meter,
and they were near background levels. ICP-OES was used to quantify
the uptake of 19 elements on the solid supports.14

5.3 Uptake, Purification, and
Scale-Up with Sulfonic
Acid Solid Supports (Figure 1B,C)
The 24 h and large-scale uptake studies were
performed simultaneously with the sulfonic acid functionalized solid
support. 24 h Uptake Study: To the target box was
added five new sulfonic acid solid supports, and the box was placed
in the BLIP cooling water. The box was removed at 30 min, 1, 3–4,
6–7, and 24 h, and one of the new sulfonic acid solid supports
was removed at each time point. Each solid support was processed separately;
the metals were removed from the surface as described above, and the
activity of each radioactive metal was quantified by γ spectroscopy. Purification of Be-7 Study (Figure 1C): seven used solid supports with captured
Be-7 were placed in different 15 mL solutions of 0.001, 0.005, 0.01,
0.05, 0.1, 0.5, or 1 M HCl. The amount and purity of Be-7 were determined
for the seven different conditions. The 1 M HCl sample was incubated
two times with 15 mL. A second elution solvent system was studied
with four other used solid supports incubated in 0.001, 0.01, 0.1,
or 1 M ammonium chloride. One of the used solid supports was added
to 15 mL of 10 M HCl; the sample was incubated for 30 min and the
activity was determined. The 10 M HCl solution with Be-7 was then
added to a 10 mL AG1X8 resin. After eluting the 10 M HCl solution,
the column was rinsed with 2 mL × 5 mL of 10 M HCl and the activity
and purity of Be-7 were determined. Large-Scale Uptake Study: During the 24 h uptake study, a large-scale study to capture Be-7
from the water was also conducted. For this study, 10 new, 17 previously
used, and 11 “crushed” sulfonic acid solid supports
were color coded and added to the target holder. After 24 h of exposure
to the cooling water, the solid supports were removed. The remainder
of solid supports were processed in three groups (new, used, and crushed)
with 50 mL of 10 M HCl, and Be-7 activity was determined. Then, all
of the 10 M HCl solutions used to release the metals from all of the
solid support solutions were pooled. The solution was passed through
two 10 mL AG1 columns, and the columns were rinsed with 2 mL ×
10 mL of 10 M HCl. The solutions were evaporated to dryness and dissolved
in 20 mL of 1 M HCl, and the purity and quantity of Be-7 were determined.
