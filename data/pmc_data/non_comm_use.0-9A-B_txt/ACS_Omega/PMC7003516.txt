While simulating
toe-to-heel air injection (THAI), which is a variant
of conventional in situ combustion that uses a horizontal producer
well to recover mobilized partially upgraded heavy oil, the chemical
kinetics is one of the main sources of uncertainty because the hydrocarbon
must be represented by the use of oil pseudo-components. There is,
however, no study comparing the predictive capability of the different
kinetics schemes used to simulate the THAI process. From the literature,
it was determined that the thermal cracking kinetics schemes can be
broadly divided into two: split and direct conversion schemes. Unlike
the former, the latter does not depend on the selected stoichiometric
coefficients of the products. It is concluded that by using a direct
conversion scheme, the extent of uncertainty imposed by the kinetics
is reduced as the stoichiometric coefficients of the products are
known with certainty. Three models, P, G, and B, each with their own
different kinetics schemes, were successfully validated against a
three-dimensional combustion cell experiment. In models P and G, which
do not take low-temperature oxidation (LTO) into account, the effect
of oil pseudo-component combustion reactions is insignificant. For
model B, which included LTO reactions, LTO was also found to be insignificant
because only a small fraction of oxygen bypassed the combustion front
and the combustion zone was maintained at temperatures of over 600°C.
Therefore, in all the models, it is observed that coke deposition
was due to the thermal cracking taking place ahead of the combustion
zone. During the first phase of the combustion, peak temperature curves
of models P, G, and B closely matched the experimental curve, albeit
with some deviations by up to 100°C between 90 and 120 min. After
the increase in the air injection flux, only the model P curve overlapped
the experimental curve. The model P cumulative oil production curve
deviated from the experimental one by only a relative error of 4.0%
compared to deviations in models G and B by relative errors of 6.0
and 8.3%, respectively. Consequently, it follows that model P provided
better predictions of the peak temperature and cumulative oil production.
The same conclusion can be drawn with regard to the produced oxygen
concentration and combustion front velocity. With regard to American
Petroleum Institute (API) gravity, it is found that all the three
models predicted very similar trends to the experiment, just like
in the case of the oil production rate curves, and therefore, no model,
in these two cases, can be singled out as the best. Also, all the
models’ predictions of the produced COX concentration prior to the increase in the air flux closely
match the experimental curve. There are, however, serious differences,
especially by model P, from the reported experimental curve by up
to 15% after the increase in the air flux.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Conventional in situ combustion (ISC) involves air injection into
an oil reservoir to oxidize the immobile carbonaceous fraction of
the bitumen/heavy oil in place. An advancing and expanding combustion
front is created and sustained with the continuous air injection via
a vertical injector well. The heat generated during the combustion
results in substantial viscosity reduction and significant upgrading
of the heavy oil. The mobilized oil has to travel over several hundreds
of meters before reaching the vertical production well. Toe-to-heel
air injection (THAI) is a variant of conventional ISC that uses the
horizontal well for heavy oil mobilization and production. In THAI,
the combination of heat from combustion reactions, mass and momentum
transfer, and gravity-assisted drainage is used to mobilize the heavy
oil to the surface.1−7The combustion front propagates continuously from the toe to the
heel of the horizontal producer (HP) well. During the process, typical
temperatures in the vicinity of the combustion region range between
500 and 700°C.1 The high temperature
is similar to that reported by Petrobank during their WHITESAND’s
field pilot project.4 Unlike in the case
of conventional ISC, the mobilized oil is continuously produced as
it gravity-drained and as it needs not bank and/or travel over hundreds
of meters. Therefore, THAI automatically falls into the category of
the short distance gravity drainage oil recovery and upgrading techniques.2 The full description of the advantages of the
THAI process is given elsewhere.5−7

The air injection enhanced
oil recovery technique is usually studied
by the use of either the combustion tube8−14 or three-dimensional (3D) combustion cell.1,15,16 The experiment allows the evaluation of
the likely mechanism of the physicochemical processes at the field
scale. Numerical models are then developed and validated against the
experimental results. The model is then upscaled for field scale evaluations.17 However, the kinetics of fuel deposition and
combustion reactions required to simulate the air injection enhanced
oil recovery process remains one of the main sources of uncertainty.
Not only that, oil pseudo-components must be used due to the complex
nature of hydrocarbons and the impracticality of developing kinetics
based on the total number of the individual compounds making up the
heavy oil. In addition to that, the main mechanism through which fuel
for the sustenance of high-temperature oxidation (HTO) is deposited
remains a contentious issue. Some authors consider fuel deposition
to be mainly as a result of low-temperature oxidation (LTO) of the
heavy oil,13,18 while others consider it to be
due to thermal cracking of the heavier fraction ahead of the combustion
zone.8,9,19 Alexander
et al.,20 however, observed that fuel deposition
via LTO is only significant during the start-up period (i.e., prior
to coke combustion). Therefore, the aim of this work is twofold: first
to present a brief review about the kinetics schemes used when simulating
ISC and the second is to present a comparative study of the numerical
simulation results of three different kinetics schemes validated against
experimental results. It should be noted that the rock–fluid
properties could also be one of the main sources of uncertainty when
simulating the THAI process. However, because they are not the subject
of this work, they are not considered here.

1.1 Chemical
Kinetics
1.1.1 Direct Conversion Thermal Cracking Kinetics
Thermal cracking reaction kinetics schemes, which are very similar
in terms of general representation and proposed for implementation
when simulating the air injection enhanced oil recovery process, are
shown in Figure 1.18,19,21−24 In all the schemes except that
of Wiehe,22 coke was considered to be formed
from asphaltene cracking after a certain induction period which depends
on the initial asphaltene content of the oil.22,25,26 In addition to the formation from asphaltene,
the coke was considered to be formed from thermal cracking of the
maltene pseudo-component by Gray et al.23 Radmanesh et al.24 also considered the
thermal cracking of both the light and heavy oil pseudo-components
to result in coke formation (Figure 1 and Table 1). The number of pseudo-components considered by Radmanesh
et al.24as been reduced by lumping the
“distillates” and “gas oil” pseudo-components
to form “light oil” in this study. In the case of Wiehe,22 in which thermal cracking kinetics of the Cold
Lake vacuum residue was developed, the coke generation was considered
to be the result of the formation of supersaturated solution of the
“asphaltene core”. The coke formed only when the solubility
limit of the “asphaltene core”, which was formed directly
from the heavy oil, was reached. Phillips et al.19 developed two sets of cracking kinetics schemes (referred
to “model A” and “model B”) for Athabasca
bitumen. In one of the models, (i.e.,“model A” which
is shown in Figure 1), the formation of light pseudo-components from “asphaltene”
was considered insignificant based on the assumption that the light
oil pseudo-component is formed from thermal cracking of the heavy
oil pseudo-component. The thermal cracking kinetics data fitted excellently
in “model A” compared to the fit obtained in the other
model (i.e.,“model B”) which had six pseudo-components.
These types of thermal cracking kinetics can be described as direct
conversion kinetics because the formation of any pseudo-component
has a different set of kinetics parameters and the stoichiometric
coefficient of the products is easily determinable.

1.1.2 Split Conversion Thermal
Cracking Kinetics
Split thermal cracking kinetics can be
described as those schemes
that consider coke formation to be the result of conversion of the
heavy oil pseudo-component into coke and light oil pseudo-components.
A single frequency factor, as well as activation energy, for the formation
of the two (or more) pseudo-components is associated with this kind
of scheme. The scheme does not take into account the induction period
before coke formation. A significant number of simulation studies
have used this kind of thermal cracking reaction scheme.9,14,26−31 A typical general representation is shown in Figure 2. Quite good matches were obtained using
this scheme. However, the main disadvantage with such a scheme is
its heavy dependence on the selected stoichiometric coefficients of
the products.

oil formation
from the heavy component.

1.1.3 Low-Temperature Oxidation
LTO is
an oxygen addition reaction which results in an increase in the asphaltene
content of heavy oil. The increase in the asphaltene content results
in an increase in the overall oil viscosity. Operating in an LTO mode,
which usually takes place in the temperature region of less than 380°C,32−34 has been reported to result in poor combustion propagation because
of restricted gas distribution.3,35 This is why an adequate
air injection rate must be maintained during combustion in order to
not allow the system to switch to the LTO mode. The kinetics of Athabasca
bitumen developed by Belgraveet al.18 considered
coke formation to be due to both thermal cracking (Figure 1 and Table 1), as described earlier, and LTO reactions.
In the LTO reactions, “maltenes”combined with oxygen
to form “asphaltenes”and “asphaltenes”
in turn reacted with oxygen to form coke. A typical LTO reaction is
shown in Figure 3.
For their model to be accurately accounting for the oxygen atoms that
combined with partially oxidized “asphaltenes” to form
solid coke (CH1.3), gaseous products must be produced directly
from the “asphaltenes”. This was represented by the
thermal cracking reaction 1 shown in Figure 1.

Figure 3 Typical representation of LTO reaction.

Jia et al.36 developed
a kinetics model
of thermal cracking and LTO reactions based on Athabasca bitumen.
Their model quite accurately predicted the thermal cracking products
obtained by Hayashitaniet al.37 The induction
period before coke formation took place was also closely predicted.
An experimental study of LTO of Athabasca bitumen performed by Millouret
al.32 showed that more coke was deposited
when bitumen was used as the starting material instead of any of the
pseudo-components. The coke formation was observed to take place after
some induction period. They also observed that at temperatures more
than 175°C, the LTO reaction order with respect to oxygen partial
pressure tended to zero, implying that once a certain high temperature
is reached, LTO becomes insignificant and hence has no effect on the
process. In another study carried out by Adegbesanet al.21 on LTO of Athabasca bitumen, the overall oxygen
consumption kinetics together with four different thermal cracking
reactions were developed. The first scheme showed that bitumen combined
with oxygen in the LTO region to produce products. However, no information
about what the products were was given. A good match was however obtained
when one of the thermal cracking kinetics, which did not take the
formation of coke from the LTO reaction into account, was validated
against experimental results.

1.1.4 High-Temperature
Oxidation
In HTO,
coke is combusted in the presence of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, and water. A typical HTO representation is shown
in Figure 4 below.
A detailed review about the reactions involved during in situ combustion
has been given elsewhere.38,39

Figure 4 Typical representation
of a HTO reaction.

Another set of reactions
often incorporated into the numerical
simulations of the in situ combustion process are the individual pseudo-component
combustion reactions. Typically, the oil pseudo-component is oxidized
to carbon oxides and water. Greaves et al.29 and Marjerrison and Fassihi40 have found
that the effect of these reactions on the simulation results is negligible.
This is because oxygen has to bypass the combustion front before oil
is burned. However, authors such as Lin et al.9 and Anaya et al.28 have included them
in their model and their influence have not been reported.

Overall,
what could be deduced from these different studies is
that the formation of coke, either due to thermal cracking or as a
result of LTO, is not an instantaneous process but requires an induction
period. The effect of LTO as a mechanism of fuel deposition as applied
to the THAI process has not been investigated. Moreover, in the literature,
to the best of my knowledge, two different kinetics schemes were validated
against the THAI experiment reported in Xia and Greaves.1 The first used the split conversion29 and the second used the direct conversion5 thermal cracking schemes, respectively. No comparison
between the predictions of each kinetics scheme was however made.
Given that the kinetics is one of the main sources of uncertainty
when simulating the THAI process, it is the aim of this work to investigate
how closely each of the three different kinetics schemes will history-match
the 3D combustion cell experimental results. The differences and similarities
among the predictions by the three different kinetics schemes are
discussed. The first numerical simulation model (i.e., model P) used
Phillips et al.19 direct conversion thermal
cracking kinetics scheme, which can also be found in Rabiu Ado et
al.5 and Ado,41,42 the second used modified Greaves et al.29 split conversion kinetics scheme (i.e., model G), while the third
used Belgrave et al.18 direct conversion
kinetics scheme with LTO reactions for fuel deposition and upgrading
(i.e., model B). The two former schemes (models P and G) included
combustion of oil pseudo-components together with HTO combustion reactions
while the latter considered HTO combustion reaction only.

2 Results and Discussion
After successful validation
of the three different models against
the 3D combustion cell experimental result, the prediction of peak
temperature, oil production rate, cumulative oil production, American
Petroleum Institute (API) gravity, produced oxygen mole percent, COX (i.e., combination of CO2 and
CO), and combustion front velocity by each model are compared.

2.1 Peak Temperature
A close match between
the simulated and experimental peak temperature is obtained over the
significant portion of the dry combustion period (Figure 5). All the peak temperature
predictions by the three models are better than that by Greaves et
al.29 However, the closest match is achieved
with the model P with the predicted peak temperature overlapping the
experimental one during most of the dry combustion period. Models
G and B deviated from the experimental peak temperature toward the
end of the dry combustion period just like in the case of Greaves
et al.29 The predicted spike in the peak
temperature by models P and G, which occurred when the combustion
front most likely reached the toe of the HP well and consumed the
large amount of coke, only lagged the experimental one by only 20
min. This is a significant improvement when compared to the prediction
by the model of Greaves et al.29 here the
discrepancy is more than six times that observed in the three new
models (Figure 5).
Furthermore, it should be noted that model B predicted multiple spikes
on the peak temperature (Figure 5) from around 170–220 min. This indicated that
there were different grid-blocks around the toe of the HP well that
contained different large coke amounts.

Figure 5 Peak temperature vs time.

All the models also, dynamically, respond to the
increase in the
air injection rate, as reflected in the increase in peak temperature
at 190 min. Because, during the experiment and as predicted by all
the models, the peak temperature is maintained above 600°C and
only small concentration of oxygen is observed to bypass the combustion
front in the case of model B, LTO reactions were found to be insignificant.
Thus, all the fuel deposition as predicted by each model was due to
thermal cracking ahead of the combustion front.

2.2 Oil Production Rate
As the bitumen
has no mobility prior to preheating, oil production begins only after
the first 18 min of the pre-ignition heating cycle (PIHC) (Figure 6). All the models,
including Greaves et al.,29 over predicted
the oil production rate over the 18–30 min period by 12–14
cm3min–1. The over prediction was observed
to be due to pressure build-up which is caused by significant thermal
cracking of oil around the preheated zone. Prior to the increase of
air injection flux by 33% (i.e., to 16 m3 m–2·h–1), the trends in the predicted and experimental
oil production rates matched closely. The Greaves et al.29 oil production rate curve slightly lies above
the experimental curve from 190 to 280 min. Thereafter, it lies below
the experimental curve up to the end of the dry combustion period.
The decrease in the oil production rate corresponds to the period
over which oxygen production was predicted to take place, as will
be seen in Figure 9. The oil production rate curves predicted by models G, P,and B lie
below the experimental curve from 190 min to the end of the dry combustion
period. On the whole, there is, however, a good agreement between
the models predictions and the experimental oil production rate, over
most part of the combustion period.

Figure 6 Oil production rate vs time.

2.3 Cumulative Oil Production
All the
models predicted a cumulative oil production of 4% of oil originally
in place at the end of the 30 min of the PIHC and thus exactly matching
the experimental value (Figure 7). It has been noted, however, that the trend in the predicted
curves did not follow the experimental one, which is caused by the
delay in oil production (Figure 6). This is because the mobilized oil has to reach the
HP first before being produced on the surface. On the overall general
trend, the closest match was obtained with model P, which under predicted
the experimental cumulative production by an overall relative error
of 4% (Figure 7). On
the other hand, models G and B under predicted the cumulative oil
production at the end of the dry combustion period by overall relative
errors of 6.0 and 8.3%, respectively. This means a significant improvement
over the prediction by the Greaves et al.29 model, which deviated from the experimental cumulative oil production
by a relative error of 7.2%, is realized by models P and G.

Figure 7 Cumulative
oilproduction vs time.

2.4 Oil Upgrading
The API gravity gives
the measure of the extent to which the bitumen is upgraded. The general
trend of the experimental API gravity is closely predicted by all
the three models (Figure 8). However, a significant deviation by up to 4 API points
between the experiment and the predictions can be observed over the
time period of 80–140 min. The deviation could be due to the
fact that the API gravity measured during the experiment is that of
oil collected over every 15 min period (sampling takes place every
quarter of an hour during the experiment). Therefore, unlike in the
case of the numerical predictions in which the API gravity of produced
oil over a fraction of a minute is reported, the variation in the
experiment was ironed out because of the low frequency of sampling.
After 150 min, all the model predictions closely match the experiment
up to the end of the dry combustion period. From Figure 8, it can be determined that
all the models predicted a very similar trend in the API gravity and
no particular model, just like in the case of the oil production rate
curves (Figure 6),
can be singled out as the best in terms of API gravity predictions.

Figure 8 API gravity
vs time.

2.5 Oxygen
Concentration
An accurate
prediction of oxygen utilization is critical to the safety and economics
of the THAI process. The experiment showed that oxygen production
started prior to the increase in the air injection flux (Figure 9). This is contrary to the explanation provided by Greaves
et al.29 that the oxygen production was
due to an increase in the air injection flux. One of the major improvements
realized over Greaves et al.29 model is
that the duration when oxygen production began is excellently predicted
by models P and G. However, in the case of Greaves et al.29 prediction, a serious delay by up to 105 min
can be observed (Figure 9). The trend predicted by model G is very similar to the experimental
trend over time periods of 175–275 min. Thereafter, the concentration
of the produced oxygen dropped from 1.00 mol% to about 0.86 mol% up
to 315 min (Figure 9). The increase in oxygen utilization is reflected in the corresponding
increase in peak temperature after 250 min. The trend predicted by
model P is essentially similar to the experimental one. However, there
is the occurrence of regular periodic cycles in the oxygen concentration
curve P which is as a result of propagating combustion along the HP
in zones of alternating low and high coke concentrations. However,
observing Figure 9 closely,
it can be seen that all the models predicted periodic cycles in the
oxygen concentration curves. Similarly, there are multiple minimum
and maximum points on the oxygen concentration experimental curve,
which are thought to be replicated by all the models. However, the
regular periodic cycles in model P are more pronounced compared to
the other models. The difference between the periodic cycles in model
P and the experiment could be explained by the fact that the flue
gas concentration was sampled discretely during the experiment and
as a result, the rate of sampling might not be sufficient to display
pronounced periodicity like that shown in model P. Because alternated
low and high coke concentrations along the HP well are thought to
cause the periodicity in all the models and the experiments, it can
be explained that the alternating low and high coke concentrations
along the HP are due to the variability (periodic cycles of crest
and trough) in the rates of oil production (see Figure 6) as the combustion and the mobile oil zone
propagated in a toe-to-heel manner. It could be that when there is
a decrease in the oil production rate (i.e., trough in the curve),
more of the oil is available to be converted to coke and when there
is an increase in the oil production rate (i.e., crest in the curve)
less of the oil is available to be converted to coke. In the case
of model B, it can be observed that the oxygen production began at
around 40 min and the concentration remained below 0.25 mol% up to
220 min. The cause of early breakthrough was observed to be as a result
of air bypassing the HTO combustion zone. However, despite that, LTO
is found to be insignificant. After 220 min, the combustion front
at the toe started to propagate along the HP. This is why the concentration
of the produced oxygen increased up to a maximum of 0.7 mol%. It follows
that model B deviated the most from the experiment.

Figure 9 Produced oxygen concentration
vs time.

2.6 Produced
COX Concentration
During the
first phase of the dry combustion when the air flux
was 12 m3 m–2·h–1, an excellent agreement between the models predictions and the experimental
COX composition is achieved (Figure 10). However, as
the air flux was increased to 16 m3 m–2·h–1, all the models predictions remained
between 17 and 18 mol% which is a deviation from the experimental
curve by a relative error of 10–15%. This is attributed to
the fact that the CO2/(CO2 + CO) ratio and thus
the stoichiometric coefficients of the combustion reactions were kept
constant in all the models. Therefore, it is acknowledged that all
the models are incapable of replicating the dynamic increase in the
COX concentration after the increase in
the air flux.

Figure 10 Produced COXconcentration
vs time.

2.7 Combustion
Front Velocity
Figure 11 shows the graph
of the distance against time for the three different models and for
the two different air injection fluxes of 12 and 16 m3 m–2·h–1. At an air flux of 12
m3 m–2·h–1, models
P and G predicted essentially the same combustion front velocity of
0.026 m·h–1 while model B predicted 0.035 m·h–1. As the air flux was increased to 16 m3 m–2·h–1, models P and B
showed an increase in the combustion front velocity as reflected by
the increase in the slope of the distance–time graph. However,
because of high fuel availability, no increase in the combustion front
velocity is observed in model G. The average combustion front velocity
predicted by model P is 0.039 m·h–1 which deviated
from the experimental one of 0.035 m·h–1 by
a relative error of 12%. Models B and G predicted an average of 0.041
and 0.026 m·h–1 which imply deviations from
the experiment by relative errors of 17 and 25%, respectively. This
shows that model P provides a better prediction of the experimental
result.

front velocity along the vertical middle plane and at the top of the
combustion cell as predicted by the three models.

3 Conclusions
From the brief literature review
carried out, it was determined
that the thermal cracking kinetics schemes can be broadly divided
into two: the split conversion thermal cracking scheme which heavily
depends on the selected stoichiometric coefficients of the products
and direct conversion thermal cracking scheme which does not depend
on the stoichiometric coefficients of the products. The split conversion
thermal cracking kinetics scheme depends heavily on the stoichiometric
coefficients of the reaction’s products and is of the form  such that, there are infinite numbers of possible
combinations of x and y, and hence,
the scheme is highly indeterminable, while the direct conversion thermal
cracking kinetics scheme does not depende on the stoichiometric coefficient
of the reaction’s products and is of the form  such that x has a single
value and is uniquely determined; similarly y has
a single value and is uniquely determined. It is therefore concluded
that by using the direction conversion thermal cracking kinetics scheme,
the extent of uncertainty imposed by the kinetics is reduced as the
stoichiometric coefficients of the products are known with certainty.
It was also determined that the mechanism through which fuel deposition
takes place was a contentious issue as a section of authors considered
it to be as a result of thermal cracking taking place ahead of the
combustion front while the other section considered it to be due to
LTO reactions.

Three different kinetics schemes have been successfully
validated
against a 3D combustion cell experiment. In models P and G which do
not take LTO into account, it is found that the effect of the individual
oil pseudo-component combustion reaction is insignificant. For model
B which included LTO reactions, it is shown that LTO was insignificant
because only a small fraction of oxygen bypassed the combustion front
and the combustion zone was maintained at temperatures of over 600°C.
Therefore, in all the models, it is observed that fuel deposition
was as a result of thermal cracking taking place ahead of the combustion
zone. This is a similar conclusion drawn by Yang et al.13

During the first phase of the combustion,
peak temperature curves
of models P, G, and B closely matched the experimental curve, albeit
with some deviations by up to 100°C between 90 and 120 min. After
the increase in the air injection flux, only the model P curve overlapped
the experimental curve during most of the second phase of combustion.
It is therefore concluded that model P provided the best prediction
of peak temperature compared to models G and B.

The model P
cumulative oil production curve deviated from the experimental
curve by only a relative error of 4.0% compared to deviations in model
G and B by relative errors of 6.0 and 8.3%, respectively. Consequently,
it follows that model P provided a better prediction of the cumulative
oil production. The same conclusions can be drawn with regard to the
produced oxygen concentration and combustion front velocity.

With regard to API gravity, it is found that all the three models
predicted very similar trends to the experiment, just like in the
case of the oil production rate curves, and therefore, no model, in
these two cases, can be singled out as the best. Also, all the models’
predictions of the produced COX concentration
prior to the increase in the air flux closely match the experimental
curve. There are, however, serious differences, especially by model
P, from the reported experimental curve by up to 15% after the increase
in the air flux.

4 Methodology
A 3D
model based on the THAI experiment conducted by Xia and Greaves1 was developed using Computer Modelling Group’s
thermal reservoir simulator (CMG’s STARS). The commercial thermal
simulator allows the incorporation of a discretized wellbore as a
representation of a HP. This allows the transient nature of the multiphase
flow and the heat transport to be modeled by discretization. The resulting
algebraic equations, because of discretization, were then coupled
with the reservoir reactive transport equations and solved using PARASOL,
which is a parallel processing solver available in STARS. The computer
used to run the models has two parallel processors each with 8 cores
(i.e., 16 cores and, thus, 32 threads in total). However, only 25%
of the CPU is used as the maximum number of threads that can be specified
to PARASOL is 8.

The physical model comprised the 0.6 m ×
0.4 m × 0.1
m combustion cell packed with virgin Athabasca bitumen (Figure 12). An electrical
heater was used to preheat the inlet zone around the horizontal injector
(HI), prior to air injection. During the physical experiment, air
was injected at a rate of 8000 Scm3 min–1 (i.e., a flux of 12 Sm3 m–2·h–1). After 190 min, the air injection flux was increased
by 33%, to 16 Sm3 m–2·h–1, and maintained up to the end of the dry combustion period (i.e.,
320 min).

4.1 Pressure, Volume, and Temperature Data
The pressure, volume, and temperature (PVT) data
used in models P, G, and B are shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4, respectively. LC, MC, and IC, which are shown
in Table 2, represent
the light, mobile, and immobile pseudo-components, respectively. LITE
and HEAV oil, which are shown in Table 3, represent the light and heavy pseudo-components,
respectively. MALT and ASPH, which are shown in Table 4, represent the maltene and asphaltene pseudo-components,

not exactly the same as those provided by Belgrave et al.18 The change was necessary in order to obtain
the best history match possible. The viscosity of the Athabasca bitumen
as function of temperature is shown in Figure 13a. The phase equilibrium K-values for the individual pseudo-components, which are required
to account for phase change, were estimated using the Wilson equation.43 They are presented as a function of temperature

4.2 Thermal Properties of the Oil Pseudo-Components
The PVT data were used in Aspen HYSYS in conjunction
with the Peng–Robinson equation of state to obtain the thermal
properties of the oil pseudo-components for each model. The equation
to obtain both the thermal conductivity α(W/m·K) and the specific heat
capacity C (kJ/kmol·K) using the coefficients
shown in Tables 5–10 is  where T is the temperature
in K.

4.4 THAI
Kinetics
The thermal cracking
kinetics scheme and the corresponding combustion reactions used in
model P are taken from Rabiu Ado et al.5 and are shown in Table 12. In this model, the combustion of the oil pseudo-component
was found to be insignificant. This is because at the high preheating
temperature (up to 900°C), there is no oil presence around the
preheated zone and oxygen did not bypass the HTO zone. Throughout
the combustion period, the combustion zone peak temperature remained
over 600°C implying that only HTO reaction is present.

Model G is based on the modified Greaves et al.29 model in which the stoichiometric coefficients
and the
kinetics parameters of the cracking reaction were adjusted (Table 13) in order to obtain
better prediction of the fuel availability and produced oxygen concentration.
In this model, the oil combustion reactions were also observed to
be insignificant for the same reasons given above.

Model B is based on Belgrave et al.18 kinetics schemes (Table 14). After running this model with the default Belgrave
et al.18PVT data and kinetics
parameters,
a significant deviation between the experimental and simulated peak
temperature, oil production rate, cumulative oil, and so forth was
observed. This is similar to the observation made by Yang and Gates.13 The LTO reactions were also found to be insignificant
despite the presence of oil around the preheated zone. Therefore,
to better represent the Athabasca bitumen in question, Aspen HYSYS
was used to generate the PVT data for the two oil
pseudo-components. Thus, it became necessary to tune the kinetics
parameters in order to obtain a better history match. After running
the model with slightly tuned parameters, it became obvious that the
model is most sensitive to the level of fuel available and because
of that to the kinetics parameters of the coke formation reaction
(i.e., thermal cracking). With peak temperature reaching up to 900°C
during the PIHC, all the oil present around the inlet zone of the
sandpack, where the heater was embedded, was displaced by the end
of the PIHC. As a consequence, only coke was observed to be present
around the HI. This means that only the kinetics parameters of coke
formation was tuned because the effect of LTO reactions was negligible.

In each model, the stoichiometric coefficient of COX is obtained using the combination of mole
and mass
balance. Each oil pseudo-component is assigned an atomic hydrogen
to carbon (H/C) ratio. From that, the molecular weight of hydrogen
contribution toward the overall molecular weight of the oil pseudo-component
was calculated and hence that of the carbon was by default obtained.
For the combustion of each of the oil pseudo-component, hydrogen and
carbon balances were used to obtain the stoichiometric coefficient
of the reactant oxygen. Because the ratio of CO2 over (CO
+ CO2) was reported from the experiment, it automatically
means that the CO2 to CO ratio is known. Additionally,
the mol% of CO2 was reported from the experiment, and thus,
the mol% of CO is also known. Through oxygen and carbon atom balances,
the values of X and the stoichiometry of COX are, respectively, obtained such that each reaction
was balanced in terms of mass.

4.5 Boundary
Conditions
To simulate the
combustion cell, no flow boundary condition is assumed all over the
cell boundary except via the HI and HP. The HI well is flow-controlled
with the air injection rate at the early stage set to 8000 Scm3 min–1 before it was increased by one-third
to12,000 Scm3 min–1 at 190 min and maintained
until 320 min. A bottom hole pressure of 200 kPa and a total liquid
production rate of 25 cm3 min–1 are,
respectively, specified as the primary and secondary boundary conditions
for the HP well. This allows the simulator to enforce either the pressure
or the flow, depending on which one is violated, as the primary constrain.
In all the three models, the HP well is assumed to contain no oil
as an initial condition. This is because at a typical reservoir temperature
of 5–15°C,45 the Athabasca
bitumen is virtually immobile and preheating must be performed in
order for the mobility to be established. Also, it is assumed that,
during the experiment, the heat loss only occurred from both the overburden
and underburden. Therefore, the heat loss parameters were selected
via trial and error until all the experimentally measured performance
parameters of the THAI process are matched. It should be noted that
because there is no material flow in or out of the overburden and
underburden, the heat loss only occurred via conduction.

4.6 Grid Sensitivity Study
In all the
three models, the sensitivity of the simulation results to the grid
size was investigated and an optimum number of grid blocks (GBs) was
chosen. In this case, 38,000 GBs after refinement were used in each
model with the dynamic grid refinement (DynaGrid) option enabled.
The DynaGrid option works by derefining the mesh (i.e., restoring
the parent GB size) when the temperature difference in the child grids
is less than or equal to 30°C and the global mole fraction of
any component is less than or equal to 3%. For the result of the sensitivity
study, see Rabiu Ado et al.5
