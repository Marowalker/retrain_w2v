Heavy
metal oxide tungstate-based tellurite glasses TeO2–WO3 (TW) containing Er3+/Yb3+ ions have
been prepared by the melting and quenching method. The
optical absorption and upconversion (UC) emission studies for the
doped/codoped glasses have been performed. The effect of the addition
of Pb3O4 and TiO2 to the Er3+/Yb3+:TW glass on its physical properties, optical absorption,
and UC emission spectra under 980 nm/808 nm excitations has been studied.
A significant enhancement in the UC emission intensity lying in the
green and red region has been observed on introducing Pb3O4 and TiO2 into the Er3+/Yb3+:TW glass. The improvement in the UC emission intensity and
full width at half maximum of the bands have been explained on the
basis of energy transfer, local field correction factor, and Urbach
energy. The non-color tunability in the color emitted from the prepared
Er3+/Yb3+:TWPTi glass upon near-infrared (NIR)
excitation at different pump power has been reported. Also, the color-correlated
temperature and color purity have been measured under both NIR excitations.

1 Introduction
The tellurite-based glasses
doped with rare earth (RE) ions are
the main subject of research because of their special optical and
physical properties such as high thermal stability, low phonon energy
(∼800 cm–1), low melting point, non-hygroscopic
nature, and high nonlinear refractive indices.1,2 The
hosts used to prepare the glasses should have high radiative emission
rates and low absorption coefficients within the wavelength range
of interest. In the tellurite glasses, tellurium dioxide (TeO2) is the main component as the conditional glass former, but
it cannot produce the glass itself. Therefore, to prepare the glasses,
other supporting metal oxides like WO3, Pb3O4, TiO2, etc. are used as the glass modifiers. The
heavy metal oxide-based tellurite (HMT) glasses have low phonon energy,
low melting point, high refractive index, and high infrared transmittance
when compared to the borate, silicate, and phosphate glasses.3−6 Because of their low phonon energy, the RE ion-doped glassy/crystalline
materials exhibit low non-radiative relaxations (NRRs) as well as
high probability of radiative transitions upon near-infrared (NIR)
excitation. Researchers all over the world are trying to investigate
such RE ion-doped crystalline powder or glassy hosts that show efficient
frequency upconversion (UC). The HMT glasses and various crystalline
nanomaterials doped with RE ions have great potential applications
in the field of photonics, biomedical and home appliances, etc.4,6−10

The absorption spectra of RE ion-doped/codoped glasses play
a vital
role in determining the Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters, experimental
and calculated oscillator strengths, transition probabilities, radiative
and NRR rates, absorption cross-sections, etc.6,11,12 Among all the lanthanide elements, the doping
of erbium oxide (Er2O3) is more sensitive than
other elements for the development of fluorescent materials. The erbium
(Er3+) ions in heavy metal oxide (HMO) glassy materials
are more interesting to produce UC emissions upon 808 and 980 nm excitation.
The 4I9/2 and 4I11/2 energy
levels of the Er3+ ion have energy around ∼12 376
cm–1 (808 nm) and ∼10 204 cm–1 (980 nm); therefore, the Er3+ ions easily absorb 808
and 980 nm laser photons to produce green and red UC emission bands
corresponding to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions.6,13,14 Infrared to visible UC emission spectra in the Er3+-doped
TeO2–WO3–Bi2O3 glasses with silver nanoparticles have been studied by de Campos
et al.15 The Yb3+ ions directly
absorb the 980 nm laser photons, because it has the energy levels 2F7/2 (ground level) and 2F5/2 (excited level) with an energy gap ≈ 10 204 cm–1. They have a very high absorption cross-section corresponding
to the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 absorption transition when compared to the 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 absorption transition of the
Er3+ ion.12,14,16 Li et al. studied the frequency UC emission upon 808 and 980 nm
laser excitations in the 32Nb2O5–10La2O3–16Zr2O3 glass activated
with Er3+/Yb3+.13 Ragin et al. reported the Er3+/Yb3+-doped/codoped
low hydroxide bismuth-germanate glass to enhance the mid-infrared
2.7 μm luminescence corresponding to 4I11/2 → 4I13/2 under 980 nm pump radiation
and concluded that the developed glass can be used in mid-infrared
applications.16 Because of their special
physical and chemical properties, the RE ion-doped HMO glasses have
potential applications in three dimensional color displays, fluorescent
biolabels, solid-state lasers, solar cells, NIR to visible upconverters,
temperature sensors, intrinsic optical bistability for optical switching,
etc.12−20 Oliveira et al.21 reported the frequency
UC of CW infrared radiation at 1.06 μm into the visible in the
Er3+/Yb3+:Ga2S3:La2O3 glasses followed by the energy transfer and
non-radiative phonon-assisted processes. The thermally induced three-fold
infrared to visible UC emission enhancement in the Er3+/Yb3+:Ga2S3:La2O3 glasses upon excitation at 1.064 μm is reported by
dos Santos et al.22 An enhancement observed
in the Er3+/Yb3+:PbO–GeO2 glass
containing silver nanoparticles under 980 nm excitation has been reported.
This has been explained on the basis of the energy transfer process
from the Yb3+ to Er3+ and the local field due
to silver nanoparticles.23 An enhanced
frequency UC emission in the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped
HMO-based glasses upon 980 nm excitation has been reported.6 Even after so many studies, research in this
area for different applications in different fields is still going
on. For practical applications, the concentration of the dopants should
not be very small. However, the problem of concentration quenching,
“which occurs at a high concentration of the dopants,”
limits their applications. Therefore, to reduce the problem of concentration
quenching at a high dopant concentration and to improve the spectroscopic
properties for practical applications, researchers are in the process
of finding a suitable host.

In view of the above discussion,
the present article reports the
frequency UC of 980 nm/808 nm radiations into visible and its related
processes in the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TeO2–WO3 (TW), TeO2–WO3–Pb3O4 (TWP), and TeO2–WO3–Pb3O4–TiO2 (TWPTi) glasses synthesized by the classical melting and quenching
technique.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Study
of Absorption Spectra
UV–vis–NIR
absorption spectra of the Er3+/Er3+/Yb3+-doped/codoped glasses within the 400–2000 nm region are shown
in Figure 1. Seven
absorption bands centered at ∼490, ∼522, ∼545,
∼800, ∼982, and ∼1506 nm are observed. These
observed absorption bands are due to the absorption transitions of
the Er3+ ions from its ground state (4I15/2) to different excited states such as 4F7/2, 2H11/2, 4S3/2, 4F9/2, 4I9/2, 4I11/2, and 4I13/2, respectively.6,14,24 The positions of absorption bands
are not altered significantly because of the shielding effect generated
by the 5s2 and 5p6 completely filled atomic
orbitals of the RE ion. However, because of the variation in crystal
field strengths, the observed absorption bands are inhomogeneously
broadened in all the synthesized glasses. In the codoped glasses,
the absorption band around ∼982 nm appears broader because
of the superposition of the 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 and 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 absorption transitions of Er3+ and
Yb3+ ions, respectively. The Yb3+ ions have
a large absorption cross-section corresponding to the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition when
compared to the absorption cross-section of the Er3+ ions
corresponding to the 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 transition in the developed HMT glasses.14,18 The absorption cross-section (∼14.87 × 10–18 cm2) corresponding to the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 (Yb3+) transition
is about seven times larger than that of the Er3+ ion corresponding
to the 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 transition (∼2.21 × 10–18 cm2) in the TW glass. The observed absorption band corresponding to
the 4I15/2 → 2H11/2 transition centered at ∼522 nm is observed the highest among
all other absorption bands because of its hypersensitive nature, and
because it follows the selection rule as |ΔL| ≤ 2 and |ΔJ| ≤ 2. In many
cases, hypersensitive transitions follow the selection rule |ΔL| ≤ 2, |ΔJ| ≤ 2, and
|ΔS| ≤ 0.6,25

2.2 Optical Band Gap and Urbach Energy Analysis
The absorption spectrum plays the key role in finding out the optically
induced transitions and calculating the optical band gap in the glass
materials. It also helps in finding out the absorption coefficient
(α) by using the Beer–Lambert law (or Beer’s law).26 The direct optical band gap has been investigated
(Figure 2) for all
the Er–TW, Er–Yb–TW, Er–Yb–TWP,
and Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses by using their respective absorption
spectra (Figure 1).
In the amorphous materials, the absorption edge is not well defined
and found to be less sharp when compared to that of crystalline materials.27

Figure 2 Estimation of the optical direct band gap in (a) Er–TW,
(b) Er–Yb–TW, (c) Er–Yb–TWP, and (d) Er–Yb–TWPTi
glasses.

The absorption coefficient (α),
optical band gap (Eg), and incident photon
energy (hν) are correlated by a relation and
are given by Tauc and Mott,28,29 1  where,
“A”
represents the proportionality constant and “r” is used for a particular real number, such as, r = 1/2 and 3/2 for direct allowed and direct forbidden transitions,
whereas r = 2 and 3 are used for indirect allowed
and indirect forbidden transitions, respectively.12 Therefore, to calculate the direct optical band gap in
all the RE ion-doped/codoped glasses, r = 1/2 has
been considered in eq 1. The curves between (αhν)2 versus incident radiation energy “hν (in eV)”
for all the doped/codoped glasses are shown in Figure 2. The optical band gap values have been examined
by extrapolating the linear portion of the plotted curves up to (αhν)2 = 0. For all the prepared Er–TW,
Er–Yb–TW, Er–Yb–TWP, and Er–Yb–TWPTi
glasses, the optical band gap values are found to be 2.94, 2.92, 2.76,
and 2.14 eV, respectively. In both the Er3+-doped and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW glasses, the band gap value is
found to be approximately the same, but it decreases up to 2.14 eV
on introducing the Pb3O4 and TiO2 into the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW glass. This
reduction in the optical band gap is basically due to the modification
in the local field around the RE ions, and hence, the structure of
the Er3+-doped TW glass remains the same on codoping the
Yb3+ ions but changes on introducing the Pb3O4 and TiO2.6

In the amorphous solid materials, there is a forbidden energy gap
which is called the Urbach energy of the material. The disorderness
in the structure of the amorphous material is measured on the basis
of Urbach energy. According to Urbach, in an amorphous material, the
relation between the absorption coefficient and incident photon energy
can be expressed as30 2  where, “B”
is another proportional constant. The exponential behaviour given
in eq 2 has been demonstrated
and the curves are plotted between logarithmic values of the absorption
coefficient versus incident photon energy for all the prepared RE
ion-doped/codoped Er–TW, Er–Yb–TW, Er–Yb–TWP,
and Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses, respectively (Figure 3). The reciprocal of the slope
of the linear portion of the curve between ln(α) versus hν (shown in Figure 3) provides the value of Urbach energy.31 The values of Urbach energy are found to be 0.31, 0.22,
0.48, and 1.23 eV for all the Er–TW, Er–Yb–TW,
Er–Yb–TWP, and Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses, respectively.
Therefore, on the basis of Urbach energy, it could be concluded that
the disorder in the structure of the codoped TW glass increases on
introducing the Pb3O4 and TiO2 HMOs,
respectively. The numerical values of the direct optical band gap
and Urbach energy of all the prepared glasses are listed in Table 1.

2.3 Study of Different Optical and Physical Parameters
2.3.1 Refractive Index
The refractive
indices of all the Er–TW, Er–Yb–TW, Er–Yb–TWP,
and Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses have been determined by using
Brewster’s angle polarization method. For this measurement,
a He–Ne laser of wavelength 6328 Å and output power of
5 mW was used as an optical source. In this experiment, the samples
are placed on the circular rotating angle measurement table scale
one by one in front of the polarizer. The He–Ne laser light
after polarizing through the polarizer is incident on the glass interface
making a zero angle with the normal. The rotating angle measurement
table scale is rotated unless the reflected wave from the glass interface
is observed with a minimum intensity. The angle at which the intensity
of the light wave reflected from the glass interface becomes minimum
is the Brewster’s angle (θp) (or polarizing
angle). The refractive indices of the glass samples have been determined
by applying the relation as μ = tan(θp). The
refractive indices of the Er3+/Yb3+ ion-doped/codoped
TW glasses are found to be approximately the same, but they increase
from ∼2.13 to ∼2.19 and ∼2.24 on incorporating
the Pb3O4 and TiO2 HMOs, respectively.
The numerical values of polarizing angles and their corresponding
refractive indices for all the Er–TW, Er–Yb–TW,
Er–Yb–TWP, and Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses, respectively,
are listed in Table 1.

The refractive index plays an important role in calculating
the optical and physical parameters such as reflection loss (RL), molar refraction (Rm), local field correction factor (χ), etc. The field
factor can be calculated as14,18 3  

The local
field correction factor increases from 2.19 to 2.44 after
incorporating the Pb3O4 and TiO2 materials,
respectively, into the codoped TW glass. This shows that the local
field correction factor around the RE ions is modified by 6.84 and
11.41% because of the incorporation of the HMOs Pb3O4 and TiO2 into the TW glass. The reflection (RL) loss from the glass surface can be determined
by using the following Fresnel formula32 4  

The calculated values of local field
correction factors and the
reflection loss in different glasses are reported in Table 1.

2.3.2 Density
Measurement
The density
(ρ) is an important factor to determine various parameters such
as molar volume (Vm), RE ion concentration
(NRE), molar refraction (Rm), etc. The density of all the prepared glass samples
has been determined by using an experimental setup based on the Archimedes
principle in which xylene was used as the immersion liquid6,14,18,33 5  where, “Wa” and “Wb” represent
the weight of the glass sample in air and xylene, respectively. The
density of xylene is 0.86 g (cm)−3. The density
of the Er3+/Yb3+-doped/codoped TW glass was
found to be ∼5.23 g/cm3. The density of glass samples
increases up to 5.48 and 5.86 g/cm3 on incorporating the
Pb3O4 and TiO2 materials, respectively.
It means that the degree of structural compactness of the geometrical
configuration of the glass matrix enhances on introducing the Pb3O4 and TiO2 HMO materials.18 The RE ion concentration (NRE) and inter-ionic separation between RE ions (RRE) in all the prepared glasses have been calculated
by using the following relations12,18,33 6  where, “NA” is the Avogadro
number (6.022 × 1023). In
the present case, the RE ion concentration and the inter-ionic separation
almost remain the same. The molar volume (Vm) and corresponding molar refraction (Rm) of each glass sample have been calculated with the help of their
respective densities by using the following equations6,33,34 7  where, “M”
represents the molecular weight of the corresponding glass sample
and other parameters have their usual meaning as explained above.
According to eq 7, the
molar volume depends on the molecular weight and density of the glass;
however, the molar refraction is directly proportional to its molar
volume. Because of this, some discrepancy is observed in the molar
volume and molar refraction for all the prepared glasses. The molar
electronic polarizability (αm) and metallization
criterion parameter (Mc) of the glass
samples can be determined6,11 as 8  

According to the theory of
metallization
of the condensed matter, the value of Mc becomes zero when Rm/Vm becomes unity (i.e. Rm/Vm = 1).11,35 Under this condition,
the electron in the material behaves like a mobile charge particle
and the system of material shows metallic properties. Therefore, for
the solid material with non-metallic nature, the ratio of molar refraction
to the molar volume should be less than unity (i.e. Rm/Vm < 1). In both the
Er3+/Yb3+-doped/codoped TW glasses, the “Mc” remains the same (0.73), but it slightly
decreases up to 0.71 on introducing the Pb3O4 and TiO2 materials into the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW glass. This means that the tendency of metallization
of Er–Yb–TW glass increases on incorporating the Pb3O4 and TiO2 HMOs. The numerical values
of densities, RE ion concentrations, inter-ionic separation of RE
ions, molar volumes, molar refraction, molar electronic polarizability,
and metallization criterion parameter for all the Er–TW, Er–Yb–TW,
Er–Yb–TWP, and Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses are
listed in Table 1.

2.4 UC Study
2.4.1 UC
by Using 980 nm Laser Excitation
Figure 4 displays
the recorded frequency UC emission spectra of the optimized 1.0 mol

Er–Yb–TW, Er–Yb–TWP, and Er–Yb–TWPTi
glasses upon 980 nm laser diode excitation at a fixed pump power density
(61.35 W/cm2) within the 400–800 nm region. The
spectra exhibit two strong green UC emission bands centered at ∼532
and ∼550 nm corresponding to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition and one broad red UC emission band centered at ∼669
nm corresponding to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition.

and (d) Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses upon 980 nm laser excitation.
Insets of this figure show photographs of the emitted light from the
glasses and the UC emission spectrum of singly Er3+ ion-doped
TW glass.

The discrepancy in the UC emission
intensity of the observed bands
is due to their different radiative transition probabilities, local
field correction factors, and oscillator strengths in all the Er–TW,
Er–Yb–TW, Er–Yb–TWP, and Er–Yb–TWPTi
glasses.6,18 On introducing the Yb3+ ions
into the Er3+-doped TW glass, the green and red UC emission
bands corresponding to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions
are enhanced ∼9 and ∼19 times under 980 nm laser diode
excitation. This enhancement in the UC emission bands of the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW glass is basically due to the
efficient energy transfer (ET1 and ET2) from the Yb3+ ions
to the Er3+ ions, because, in the present case, the absorption
cross-section corresponding to the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 absorption transition is ∼7 times larger
when compared to the 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 absorption transition of Er3+ ions.12,14 The large variation in the red UC emission intensity corresponding
to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition is because of energy transfer and cross relaxation (CR)
processes (4I13/2 + 2F5/2 ↔ 4F9/2 + 2F7/2). The intensity ratio of the green to red UC emission band (i.e. Igreen/Ired) is found
to be ∼10.36 and ∼4.75 in the Er3+:TW and
Er3+/Yb3+:TW glasses, respectively. Because
of the combination of these green and red UC emission bands, the color
emitted from the samples appears yellowish green to the naked eyes.
The photographs of the actual color emitted from the Er3+/Yb3+-doped/codoped TW glasses are displayed in the inset
of Figure 4a,b.

After the incorporation of Pb3O4 and TiO2 HMOs into the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW
glass, the UC emission bands corresponding to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (green) and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (red) transitions are found at the same positions
but the intensity of the UC emission bands is enhanced many folds
when compared to the Er3+/Yb3+ codoped TW glass.
An intensity enhancement of about ∼13/33 and ∼39/87
times corresponding to the green and red bands in the Er3+/Yb3+:TWP/Er3+/Yb3+:TWPTi glasses
when compared to the Er3+:TW glass has been observed. The
enhancement observed corresponding to different UC emission bands
along with full width at half maximum (fwhm) values in the prepared
glasses is given in Table 2. This enhancement in the UC emission bands of Er–Yb–TWP
and Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses could be because of the increase
in the local field correction factor and, hence, the local field modifications
around the RE ions (Table 1). This leads to the increase in the radiative transition
probabilities and branching ratios corresponding to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 emission transitions.6,14,18 Also, the increment in the value of Urbach energy
on introducing the Pb3O4 and TiO2 materials shows the variation in the disorderness (asymmetry) of
the doped/codoped TW glass (Table 1). The intensity ratio of both the green UC emission
bands corresponding to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (IH) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (IS) transitions (i.e. IH/IS) is determined to be 0.23
and 0.41 in the Er–Yb–TWP and Er–Yb–TWPTi
glasses, respectively. The intensity ratio of green to red emission
bands (i.e. Igreen/Ired) is measured to be ∼3.58 and ∼3.99 in the
Er–Yb–TWP and Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses, respectively.
No effective variation in the intensity ratio (Igreen/Ired) is seen in the TWP
and TWPTi glasses; therefore, the combination of these green and red
UC emission bands exhibits a yellowish green color that could be seen
by the naked eyes {inset of Figure 4c,d}.

Samples upon 980 nm Excitation

Er–Yb–TWPTi	(∼33, ∼87)	20.53 ± 0.04	21.45 ± 0.09	
Apart from the intensity enhancement in the TWP and
TWPTi glass,
the fwhm of the green and red UC emission bands also increases gradually
(Table 2). The enhancement
in the fwhm of the bands occurs because of the increment in the inhomogeneous
local field (local field correction factor) around the RE ions due
to the incorporation of the Pb3O4 and TiO2 HMOs.6,14,18

The UC emission intensity of all the observed bands increases
on
increasing the pump power density of the incident photons.18,36 The UC emission spectra of Er–TW and Er–Yb–TWPTi
glasses have been recorded at 13.19, 23.66, 34.90, 45.11, 55.89, 66.94,
and 81.24 W/cm2 pump power density of incident photons
under 980 nm laser diode excitation {Figure 5a,b}. The associated bar curves between the
integrated UC emission intensity versus pump power density for both
the green (2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and red (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) UC emission bands
of the same glasses are also shown in the insets of Figure 5a,b. On increasing the pump
power density, no significant variation in the intensity ratio (IH/IS) of the Er–TW/Er–Yb–TWPTi
glass has been observed.

2.4.2 UC by Using 808 nm Laser Excitation
Figure 6 shows the
frequency UC emission spectra recorded at room temperature in the
visible range between 400 and 700 nm for all the Er–TW, Er–Yb–TW,
Er–Yb–TWP, and Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses upon
808 nm laser diode excitation. In all the glasses, two strong green
bands and one weak red UC emission band (as observed under 980 nm
laser diode excitation) are observed corresponding to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions upon excitation at 808 nm. During the
experiment, the pump power density of the laser source was fixed at
600 mW.

(b) Er–Yb–TW, (c) Er–Yb–TWP, and (d) Er–Yb–TWPTi
glasses upon 808 nm laser excitation at 600 mW pump power. Insets
in the figure show the photographs of the emitted color from the glass
samples, respectively.

The singly Er3+-doped TW glass intensity of the
observed
UC emission band corresponding to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition is found to be ∼4 times large when compared to
that of the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW glass under
808 nm laser diode excitation [Figure 6a,b]. The decrement in the intensity of the green UC
emission band of the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW glass
is due to the back energy transfer (BET) process from the Er3+ to the Yb3+ ions. Because of this BET, the intensity
of the observed NIR band centered around ∼940 nm increases
corresponding to the superposition of the 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 and 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transitions in the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped glass upon 808 nm laser excitation.14 The color emitted from both doped and codoped
TW glasses upon 808 nm excitation is found effectively green because
of the large green to red UC emission band intensity ratio (Igreen/Ired) when
compared to that observed under 980 nm excitation. The photographs
of the actual color emitted from the Er–TW and Er–Yb–TW
samples are displayed in the insets of Figure 6a,b, respectively.

On introducing the
Pb3O4 and TiO2 materials, respectively,
into the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW glass, the UC
emission intensity as well as the fwhm
of the bands increase gradually because of the inhomogeneous local
field generation (Table 1) around the RE ions {Figure 6c,d}. The Igreen/Ired ratio for both the Er–Yb–TWP and Er–Yb–TWPTi
glasses at ∼600 mW pump power is ∼9.28 and ∼15.16,
respectively. Because of the large green to red band intensity ratio,
the color emitted from the samples is observed to be intense green
by the naked eyes. The photographs of the actual color emitted from
both the Er–Yb–TWP and Er–Yb–TWPTi samples
are displayed in the insets of Figure 6c,d, respectively.

A pump power-dependent study
has been performed for Er–Yb–TWPTi
and the Er–TW glasses. The UC emission spectra of the Er3+-doped TW and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TWPTi
glasses have been recorded at 6.8, 101, 306, 421, 523, 711, and 945
mW pump power upon 808 nm excitation {Figure 7a,b}. It is noted that the UC emission intensity
of the green and red bands corresponding to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions increases with the pump power in both the
glasses. The bar curves for the pump power versus integrated UC emission
intensity of both the green and red bands of the Er–TW and
Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses are also shown in the insets of Figure 7a,b.

of (a,b) represent the integrated UC emission intensity vs pump power
for green and red bands.

No significant change in the intensity (IH/IS) ratio on increasing
the pump
power in Er–TW and Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses is reported,
whereas the green to red band intensity ratio (i.e. Igreen/Ired) in both the glasses
increases on increasing the pump power (Table 3). It is found to be ∼58.60 and ∼18.27
in the Er–Yb–TWPTi and Er–TW glasses, respectively,
at 945 mW pump power.

The pump power-dependent UC emission spectra
(Figures 5 and 7) of the Er3+-doped TW and Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TWPTi glasses upon 980 nm 808 nm laser diode
excitations
are helpful to obtain the information on the number of pump photons
involved in the UC process. The plot between logarithmic values of
pump powers {ln(PPUMP)} versus corresponding
integrated UC emission intensity {ln(IUP)} of green and red bands gives the slope value (n) by using the relation IUP = k(PPUMP)n,14,18,37 where, “k” is the constant and “n” represents the number of photons participating in the UC
process. The slope values for the green UC band corresponding to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition are ∼1.71 ± 0.05 and
∼1.75 ± 0.06, whereas for the red band corresponding to
the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition they are ∼1.51 ± 0.12 and ∼1.69 ±
0.10 in the Er–TW and Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses, respectively,
upon 980 nm laser diode excitation {Figure 8a,b}. However, they are found to be ∼1.65
± 0.01 and ∼1.64 ± 0.04 for green bands as well as
∼1.32 ± 0.11 and ∼1.13 ± 0.09 for red bands
in both the respective glasses upon 808 nm laser diode excitation
{Figure 8c,d}. Therefore,
from these slope values, it is concluded that two photons are involved
in radiation of the green and red emissions from Er–TW and
Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses.

2.4.3 UC Emission Mechanism Explained Through
the Energy Level Diagram
The processes involved in the UC
emission transitions under the 980 and 808 nm laser diode excitations
could be easily explained using the energy level diagram (Figure 9). The energy of
the 980 nm (i.e. ∼10 204 cm–1) photon
is just equivalent to the integer multiple of energy of the 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 and 4I11/2 → 4F7/2 absorption
transitions of the Er3+ ion. Therefore, in the singly Er3+-doped glass the 4F7/2 level is populated
through the ground state absorption (GSA) and excited state absorption
(ESA) processes, and after that it relaxes non-radiatively to the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels. The
radiative transitions from these levels to the ground state emit green
and red lights corresponding to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (∼532
nm/550 nm) transitions. The 4F9/2 level is populated
because of the ESA process from the 4I13/2 level.
A radiative transition from the 4F9/2 level
to the 4I15/2 level emits red photons corresponding
to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. In the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW glass,
apart from the Er3+ ions, the Yb3+ ions also
have the ground state (2F7/2) and one excited
state (2F5/2). The excited state 2F5/2 has the energy just equivalent to that of the 980
nm (∼10 204 cm–1) laser photon. Therefore,
the 980 nm laser photons are easily absorbed by the Yb3+ ions corresponding to the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 absorption transition in the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped glasses. Because the absorption cross-section
corresponding to the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 absorption transition (∼14.87 × 10–18 cm2) of Yb3+ ions is about
∼7 times larger than the absorption cross-section (∼2.21
× 10–18 cm2) corresponding to the 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 transition
of Er3+ ions, the intensity of all the observed UC emission
bands in the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW glass enhances
because of the efficient energy transfer (ET) from the Yb3+ ions to the Er3+ ions in the form of ET1 and ET2 processes
simultaneously. In the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW
glass, comparatively more enhancement is observed in the red UC emission
band corresponding to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. This is because of the enhanced
population of Er3+ ions in the 4F9/2 level through the energy transfer from the Yb3+ to Er3+ ions as well as CR 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 4I13/2 (Er3+) → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 4F9/2 (Er3+) processes. On introducing the Pb3O4 and TiO2 HMOs into the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW glass, the UC emission intensity of the green
and red bands is further enhanced by several folds (as discussed earlier)
because of the energy transfer from Yb3+ ions to the Er3+ ions and the inhomogeneous local field generation around
the RE ions.

Figure 9 Simplified schematic energy level diagram with possible
transitions
of Er3+ and Yb3+ ions in the Er3+/Yb3+-doped/codoped glass upon 980 and 808 nm excitations.

However, for the UC emission under
808 nm excitation, it is found
that the energy gap between the levels corresponding to the 4I15/2 → 4I9/2, 4I13/2 → 2H11/2, and 4I11/2 → 4F5/2 absorption
transitions of Er3+ ions in singly doped glasses synchronizes
with the energy of the 808 nm photon (i.e. ∼12 376 cm–1) (Figure 9). Upon 808 nm (i.e. ∼12 376 cm–1) excitation, the higher lying excited levels (4F5/2, 4F7/2, 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2) of
Er3+ ions in the Er–TW glass are populated through
GSA, ESA, and NRR processes (Figure 9). The population of Er3+ ions in the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels partially
transits downward radiatively to the ground state by emitting the
green UC emission band centered at ∼532 and 550 nm corresponding
to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition. The remaining population in the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels decay
non-radiatively to the 4F9/2 level, which again
relaxes radiatively to the ground state by emitting a weak red emission
band peaking at ∼669 nm corresponding to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. In the
Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW glass, the UC emission
intensity of the observed bands decreases because of the BET from
the Er3+ ions to Yb3+ ions. On introducing the
Pb3O4 and TiO2 HMOs into the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TW glass, the UC emission intensity
under 808 nm excitation is enhanced further due to the modification
in the local field around the RE ions.

2.5 Nature
of Bonding between RE Ions and Surrounding
Oxygen Atoms
The nature of bonding between the RE ions and
their surrounding oxygen atoms in all the prepared Er–TW, Er–Yb–TW,
Er–Yb–TWP, and Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses has
been studied from the recorded absorption spectra (Figure 1). These slight variations
in the peak positions of absorption bands in all the prepared glasses
occur because of the modification in the environment around the RE
ions on complexion, which is called the “nephelauxetic effect”.6,38 Also, variation in the positions of absorption bands arises because
of the expansion of the partially filled 4f-shell, because in the
different glass compositions the charge is transferred from the ligand
to the core of central RE ions.14,39 The energy of the absorption
bands corresponding to the 4I15/2 → 4I13/2, 4I15/2 → 4I11/2, 4I15/2 → 4I9/2, 4I15/2 → 4F9/2, 4I15/2 → 4S3/2, 4I15/2 → 2H11/2, and 4I15/2 → 4F7/2 absorption transitions for all the prepared
Er–TW, Er–Yb–TW, Er–Yb–TWP, and
Er–Yb–TWPTi glasses are listed in Table 4. The average value of the nephelauxetic
ratio “β̅” is calculated by using the following
expression14 9  where, “N”
represents the number of observed absorption bands in the respective
glass matrix. The energies (in cm–1) corresponding
to these bands in each glass are represented by “νcomp” and “νfree ions”
is the energy of free ions.40

The covalency (δ) and bonding parameters (b1/2) have been evaluated by using the following

The calculated values
of “β̅”, “δ”,
and “b1/2” for all the Er–TW,
Er–Yb–TW, Er–Yb–TWP, and Er–Yb–TWPTi
glasses are listed in Table 4 and compared with those of the other reported Er3+/Yb3+-doped/codoped SPME and SPMEA0.1 glasses.41 The positive or negative value of “δ”
justifies the covalent or ionic nature of bonding between the RE ions
and their surrounding oxygen atoms. In the present work, the negative
value of the covalency parameter confirms the ionic character of bonding
between the RE ions and their surrounding oxygen atoms.

2.6 Study of the CIE Diagram through UC Emission
Data
The position of color coordinates in the CIE diagram
of the color emitted in the UC emission spectra from Er–TW,
Er–Yb–TW, Er–Yb–TWP, and Er–Yb–TWPTi
glasses upon 980 and 808 nm excitations at fixed pump power (944 and
600 mW upon 980 and 808 nm excitations, respectively) is shown in Figure 10a,b. As the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TWPTi glass produces intense UC
emissions, the position of color coordinates of the color emitted
from the Er–Yb–TWPTi glass at different pump powers
upon 980 and 808 nm excitations has been determined {Figure 10c,d}. All the observed color
coordinates under both the excitations are listed in Table 5. No significant variation in
the position of color coordinates lying in the green region at different
pump powers has been marked. Therefore, the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TWPTi glass material can be used in colorless tunable
pure green optical display devices under 980 and 808 nm laser excitations.14,37

Figure 10 (a,b) represent the color coordinates in the CIE chromaticity diagram
of Er3+/Yb3+-doped/codoped TW, TWP, and TWPTi
glasses at fixed pump power; whereas (c,d) show the color coordinate
of Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TWPTi glass at different
pump powers upon 980 and 808 nm laser excitations, respectively.

The color-correlated temperature (CCT) has been calculated for
all the samples at fixed and different pump powers upon 980 and 808
nm laser excitations by using the following mathematical McCamy empirical
formula 11  where, the sample
color coordinate (XS, YS) is listed
in Table 5 and the
coordinates of the epicenter (Xe, Ye) are (0.3320, 0.1858),6,18 which
helps in determining the parameter “p”
{=(XS – Xe)/(YS – Ye)}. The CCT values of all the codoped samples vary from
5690 to 5974 K under 980 nm laser excitation, whereas they vary from
5826 to 6111 K under 808 nm laser diode excitation. The light sources
available commercially have CCT values in the range from 2700 to 6500
K.6,42 In the lighting industry, the lamps have a CCT value
in the range from 2700 to 4000 K which provides warm light; however,
the lamps having a higher CCT value, in the range from 4000 to 6500
K provide cool light.18,43 On the basis of above investigations,
it has been concluded that the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped
TWPTi glass having CCT values 5974 and 6099 K, respectively, under
980 and 808 nm laser excitations can be applicable in fabricating
home appliances.18

To determine the
color purity (CP) of the emitted color from the
samples under the 980 and 808 nm laser diode excitations, the following
relation has been used6,18 12  where, the (Xi, Yi) represent the coordinates
of the
illuminant point (0.3101, 0.3162).6,18,44 (XS, YS) and (Xd, Yd) are the sample color coordinates (listed in Table 5) and the coordinates
corresponding to the dominant wavelength (i.e. 550 nm), respectively.
In the present work, the coordinates corresponding to the dominant
wavelength are found to be (0.28, 0.71) and (0.29, 0.70) upon 980
and 808 nm laser diode excitations, respectively. The values of CP
from the corresponding glass samples and corresponding pump powers
are given in Table 5. From Table 5, it
is concluded that the CP of the emitted color from the Er–Yb–TWPTi
glass increases on increasing the pump powers upon both the laser
excitations. The Er–Yb–TWPTi glass shows the maximum
CP, that is, 92.1 and 100% upon 980 and 808 nm laser diode excitations,
respectively. Therefore, the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped
TWPTi glass indicate the promising applications to develop the yellowish
green as well as pure green optical devices and solid state lighting.

3 Conclusion
The optical band gap, Urbach energy,
and nature of bonding between
the RE ions and surrounding oxygen atoms have been determined from
the recorded absorption spectra of the TW, TWP, and TWPTi glasses.
The improvement in the UC emission intensity observed upon 980 nm
excitation has been explained on the basis of energy transfer from
Yb3+ to Er3+ and local field modifications around
RE ions. The decrease in the UC emission intensity upon 808 nm excitation
in the Er–Yb–TW glass is explained on the basis of BET
from Er3+ to Yb3+, whereas the increase in the
UC emission intensity on introducing Pb3O4 and
TiO2 could be explained by the increase in the local field
correction factor and, hence, the local field modifications around
the RE ions. The bonding between RE ions and surrounding oxygen atoms
is noted to be ionic in nature. The intensity of all the observed
emission bands in the UC emission spectrum of the Er3+/Yb3+-codoped TWPTi glass is found to be maximum and the emitted
color from the glass is not tuned at different pump powers. Hence,
the Er3+/Yb3+:TWPTi glass can be used in fabricating
a NIR to green upconverter, optical display devices, and household
appliances with high CP.

4 Experimental Techniques and
Characterization
All the Er3+/Yb3+ ion-doped/codoped
glasses
synthesized by the melting and quenching technique18 are listed in Table 6. High purity raw materials have been used to prepare the

To prepare the Er3+/Yb3+-doped/codoped TW,
TWP, and TWPTi glass samples, proper amounts (in grams according to
the concentration) of the starting reagents are taken in the powdered
form. The raw materials corresponding to each composition (Table 6) are ground in an
agate mortar for up to 2.0 h to obtain a fine homogeneous mixture.
These homogeneously mixed compositions of each sample (3.0 g) were
poured in an alumina crucible one by one for melting purposes and
placed in a high-temperature electric furnace at 850 °C until
the liquid sample changed into the transparent form. The transparent
form of each sample was cooled quickly in the preheated brass mould
kept at 500 °C and covered by another hot thick brass plate.
After cooling, these glass samples were cut into a particular shape
of thickness 2.0 mm and polished carefully to find a smooth surface
for better optical characterization.

The refractive indices
of all the transparent glasses were determined
by using the Brewster’s angle polarization method in which
a He–Ne laser of wavelength 6328 Å (5 mW output power)
was used as an optical source. For density measurements, the Archimedes
principle experiment was used with xylene as an immersion liquid.
The absorption spectra have been recorded in the 400–2000 nm
wavelength range using a double beam UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
with a spectral resolution of 0.5 nm. The frequency UC spectra have
been recorded through a monochromator attached with a photomultiplier
tube under the 980 and 808 nm laser diode excitations. Photometric
characterization has been performed for all the prepared glasses.
All the measurements have been carried out at room temperature (27
°C). The CCT and CP were determined through the GoCIE software.
