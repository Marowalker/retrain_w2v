Due to the anisotropic nature of
charge transport through most
organic semiconductors, the orientation of the conjugated backbone
is of great relevance because it may affect final device properties.
Herein, we present a set of four nearly isostructural molecular organic
semiconducting materials whose orientation changes drastically with
a two-atom change in the conjugated framework. We investigate the
X-ray diffraction patterns of these materials in the thin film, both
as-deposited from solution and following melt-annealing. Following
melt-annealing of the films, crystallites of all four materials orient
edge-on with respect to the substrate, which indicates that this orientation
is thermodynamically preferred. We can infer that the initial face-on
orientation of some of the materials is due to kinetic trapping during
the spin-coating process. Previous observations from the literature
suggest that the edge-on orientation is the thermodynamically preferable
state for many organic semiconducting materials. However, a cohesive
explanation for this phenomenon remains elusive.

Introduction
The orientation of
molecular organic semiconducting materials is
important due to the anisotropic nature of charge transport through
π–π stacking, which can impact device performance.
For applications such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),
edge-on orientation relative to the substrate may be preferable.1,2 However, for applications in which charges move in the direction
normal to the substrate surface (e.g., diodes, organic light-emitting
diodes, organic photovoltaics), it is beneficial for the materials
to orient face-on, as the π–π stacking is in the
direction of charge transport.3−5 However, orientation with respect
to the substrate is not the single determining factor of charge carrier
mobility in a given direction.6−10 Factors, such as crystal structure, formation of connected networks,
grain boundaries, and intermolecular electronic coupling, play a role,
as well.11 Even though the degree by which
orientation impacts charge carrier mobility is under examination,
the forces and molecular features that impact the preferred orientation
have not been fully elucidated.

Previous reports12 demonstrated that
material orientation relative to the substrate can be controlled by
processing conditions. For the small molecule donor p-SIDT(FBTTh2)2, spin-coating the material with or without the
solvent additive diiodooctane results in face-on or edge-on crystallites
of the donor, respectively. In bilayer devices, improved performance
is due to an increase in open circuit voltage from 0.69 V to
0.84 V, attributed to improved π orbital overlap with the acceptor,
[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). The widely studied polymer N2200 has also been shown
to change orientation following annealing above its melting point.13 In the as-cast film, N2200 crystallites orient
face-on and flip to edge-on when melt-annealed. There have been several
examples of this behavior in the literature,14−16 but no unifying
mechanism exists so far. Other reports,17,18 in which poly(3-alkylthiophene)
polymers were studied, suggest that higher crystallinity and preaggregation
in solution favor the edge-on orientation; however, no chemical explanation
for this phenomenon is given.

In summary, it is understood that
orientation of a material can
be controlled by processing conditions, yet there is no explanation
for the relationship between chemical structure and the final organization
obtained from solution. Given the absence of modeling tools, a priori
knowledge or other approaches that allow one to predict molecular
orientation, this question remains open to investigation.

We
previously reported19 four isomorphic
organic semiconductors, Scheme 1 (full chemical structures in Scheme S1), whose crystallite orientation in the as-cast film depends on the
position of the pyridylthiadiazole (PT) acceptor fragment within the
conjugated backbone. It was found that the molecules with benzothiadiazole
(BT) acceptors in the inner positions assume an edge-on orientation,
whereas those with PT units at the same positions show face-on orientation.
The difference in crystallite orientation, especially in the isomers
N2a and N2b, raises the question of the origin of this phenomenon.

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures of the N Series Molecules
From
top to bottom: N0, N2a,
N2b, N4.

It is important to consider that
the differences in orientation
arise from very small (single atom) changes in chemical structure.
Are the face-on crystallites the thermodynamically preferred orientation,
or is it a case of kinetic trapping?20−23 This question is relevant due
to the impact of crystallite orientation on the preferred direction
of charge transport in the solid state, especially since a molecule
in this group has been shown to be able to withstand significant thermal
stress in an organic field-effect transistor (OFET) device architecture.24 Although previous studies relied on processing
conditions to modify crystallite orientation, we present a system
in which this determination is made based on chemical structure.

Using grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and
by in situ melt-annealing of films of these four isomorphic organic
semiconductors, we sought to obtain insight into the kinetic and thermodynamic
crystallite orientations of these materials.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 illustrates
the diffraction patterns obtained for a film of N0. Figure 1a is the diffraction pattern
of the as-cast N0 film. The two most distinct peaks are the lamellar
stacking peak (∼0.4 Å–1 along the qz axis) and the π–π stacking
peak (∼1.8 Å–1 along the qxy axis), whereas the off-axis area of the image contains
diffuse scattering. Overtones of the lamellar stacking peak are visible
along the qz axis. As is typical of a
spin-coated film, the diffraction peaks show some dependence of intensity
with respect to the azimuthal angle, χ, indicating that the
crystallite orientation is not perfectly uniform.25 Film-heating was achieved via a temperature-controlled
stage. Steps of 50–25 °C were taken below 200 °C.
Smaller increases in temperature of ∼10 °C were effected
as the films neared the melting point, as determined by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC).19,26 The temperatures at
which scattering peaks disappear roughly match the melting points
from DSC (258 °C, 269 °C, 259 °C, and
265 °C for N0, N2a, N2b, and N4, respectively), as seen in Figure S1. Diffraction from the fully amorphous
melt is characterized by the lack of any discernible peaks (Figure 1b). The broad peak
at [1.7, 1.2], seen in other images as well, is due to diffraction
from the underlying Si substrate. Finally, Figure 1c is the diffraction pattern of the N0 film
following cooling from the melt (melt-annealing). The stacking distances
corresponding to the peaks discussed earlier have not changed significantly.
The π–π stacking distance remains at 3.6 Å,
and the lamellar stacking distance changes from 15.5 Å to 16.0
Å, possibly due to unfolding of the alkyl chains or a change
of inclination of the molecules relative to the substrate normal.27 Compared to Figure 1a, the diffraction pattern of Figure 1c indicates a higher degree
of order within the crystallites or throughout the film. For instance,
the full width half-maximum of the lamellar and π–π
stacking peaks changed from 0.06 Å−1 to
0.03 Å−1 and 0.12 Å−1 to 0.07 Å–1, respectively. This corresponds
to a change in the crystalline correlation length (LC)28 from 95 Å to
171 Å for the lamellar stacking peak and 47 Å to 82
Å for the π–π stacking peak. It is unclear
whether this increase in the LC is due
purely to improved order within the crystallites or to larger crystallites
as well. There is also less intensity dependence with respect to χ,
indicating that the orientation of the crystallites has become more
uniformly edge-on. After melt-annealing, the off-axis area displays
distinct peaks, attributed to improved order within the crystallites,
likely due to the extra thermal energy and crystallization time afforded
by melt-annealing the film. There is also a new peak at 0.5 Å–1 along the qz axis, which
is indicative of a secondary lamellar stacking distance of 13.7 Å.
The new off-axis π–π stacking peak at [1.7, 0.4]
(q = 1.8 Å–1, corresponding
to ∼3.5 Å) suggests that there may be two coexisting polymorphs,
supported by the presence of multiple endotherms in the DSC heating
traces19 and a second lamellar stacking
peak. However, without the crystal structure, it is difficult to attribute
these new peaks to any specific interactions or changes in local packing.

at 250 °C and melt-cooled (c).

Similar observations can be made for films of N2a. Figure 2a shows the diffraction
pattern
of the as-cast N2a film. The lamellar stacking peak is at 0.4 Å–1 along the qz axis, along
with its overtones, and the π–π stacking peak is
located at 1.8 Å–1 along the qxy axis. Some diffuse scattering is also visible in
the off-axis area. The melt diffraction pattern of the N2a film is
not shown as it is the same as that of the N0 film (i.e., no visible
scattering peaks). The lamellar stacking distance in the melt-cooled
film (Figure 2b) increases
from 14.6 Å to 16.3 Å and the π–π
stacking distance does not change from 3.4 Å. As with the melt-annealed
N0 films, the LC increases from 97 Å to
182 Å for the lamellar stacking and 67 Å to 109 Å
for the π–π stacking. There is also less disorder
along χ, indicating more uniform orientation of the crystallites
relative to the substrate. The diffraction pattern of the melt-annealed
N2a film also shows the appearance of two groups of off-axis peaks.
The first group of peaks (qxy < 0.5
Å–1) is well defined along the qz and qxy axes and has
multiple overtones. This indicates that the reflections of the unit
cell responsible for this diffraction have a low degree of disorder.
The second group of off-axis peaks (0.5 < qxy < 1.5 Å–1) is well defined in
the qxy plane, but appears poorly defined
in the qz direction, indicating a higher
degree of stacking disorder in the out-of-plane direction.

Figure 2 GIWAXS diffraction
patterns of N2a as-cast (a) and melt-cooled
(b).

As previously discussed in the Introduction, the as-cast diffraction pattern of
the N2b film (Figure 3a) is noticeably different
from those of the previously discussed materials, N0 and N2a. The
face-on orientation of as-cast N2b crystallites is consistent with
previously reported data.19 The linecuts
in Figure 3 show that
following melt-annealing, the lamellar and π–π
stacking peaks have shifted by 90° so that the π–π
stacking peak is located along the qz axis,
whereas the lamellar stacking peak is located on the qxy axis. Although the axes along which
the stacking peaks appear have changed, their q values
have not. The π–π stacking peak is at 1.8 Å–1 and the lamellar stacking peak is at 0.4 Å–1. The diffraction peaks from the as-cast N2b film
are relatively broad and show some dependence of intensity with respect
to χ. Following melt-annealing, the new edge-on crystallite
peaks are located at 1.7 Å–1 along the qxy axis (π–π stacking) and
0.4 Å–1 along the qz axis (lamellar stacking). As with N0 (Figure S2), there is also a new lamellar stacking peak that appears
at 0.5 Å–1 along the qz axis. Similarly to the previous materials, the π–π
stacking distances do not change significantly, increasing from 3.6
Å to 3.7 Å, whereas the lamellar stacking distance
decreases slightly from 17.6 Å to 15.7 Å. The new lamellar
stacking distance (13.8 Å) is also consistent with that of N0
(13.7 Å). As observed with the other melt-annealed samples, the
degree of disorder decreases compared to the as-cast films. The LC for the π–π and lamellar
stacking peaks increases from 24 Å to 94 Å and from
36 Å to 175 Å, respectively. Off-axis peaks also appear
following melt-annealing, indicating improved intracrystalline order.
Melt-annealing of the molecule N2b, which has interior PT acceptor
fragments, therefore produces a drastic change in the diffraction
pattern of the film. The main diffraction peaks reorient and resemble
the melt-annealed diffraction patterns of N0 and N2a.

Figure 3 GIWAXS diffraction patterns
of N2b as-cast (a) and melt-cooled
(b). Plots show in-plane (c) and out-of-plane (d) linecuts of N2b
as-cast and melt-cooled. The inset in (d) highlights the two lamellar
stacking peaks of the melt-annealed film.

N4 exhibits the same behavior as N2b, both in the as-cast
film
and following melt-annealing. In the as-cast diffraction pattern (Figure 4a), the π–π
stacking peak is located at 1.8 Å–1 along the qz axis and the lamellar stacking peak is located
at 0.4 Å–1 along the qxy axis. Both peaks appear broad and show intensity dependence
with χ, indicating some disorder in the crystallite orientation.
Following melt-annealing (Figure 4b), the crystallite orientation flips from face-on
to edge-on. The π–π stacking diffraction peak is
now located at 1.7 Å–1 along the qxy axis, and the lamellar stacking peak is located
at 0.4 Å–1 along the qz axis. Stacking distances do not change significantly. There is no
change in the π–π stacking distance, and the lamellar
stacking distance decreases from 17.9 Å to 17.7 Å.
The LC increases from 26 Å to
122 Å for π–π stacking and from 34 Å to
131 Å for lamellar stacking. A secondary, much less intense,
lamellar stacking peak is observed at 0.40 Å–1 along the qz axis, corresponding to
a stacking distance of 15.8 Å. As observed in the previous examples,
the azimuthal dependence of the peaks decreases significantly, indicating
more uniform crystallite orientation with respect to the substrate.
Off-axis peaks also start to appear, though they are not sharp or
intense enough to characterize. This suggests that the degree of ordering
is improved as compared to the as-cast film, but not to the same extent
as in the other materials.

Figure 4 GIWAXS diffraction patterns of N4, as-cast (a)
and melt-cooled
(b).

The reorientation of N2b and N4
crystallites following melt-annealing
of the films indicates that the initial (as-cast) face-on crystallite
orientation is kinetically trapped. In the as-cast films, the relative
population of edge-on to face-on crystallites of N2a and N2b is very
high, whereas the relative population of face-on to edge-on crystallites
is significantly smaller (Figure S3 and Table S1). The lower relative population of face-on crystallites
in the as-cast N2b and N4 films suggests that the face-on orientation
is not as favorable as the edge-on crystallites in the as-cast N0
and N2a films. Following melt-annealing, the relative population of
edge-on to face-on crystallites is at least 8:1 in all four films,
indicating that crystallites of all four materials significantly prefer
the edge-on orientation. Although the mechanism for kinetic trapping
into face-on orientation of crystallites is not yet completely understood
(see relevant system in N2200),13−16 the possibility of there being a kinetic trap during
spin-coating is not out of the question. When comparing the lattice
parameters of the sets of materials (kinetically trapped and edge-on)
in Table 1, it is important
to note that there are some consistent trends, which could correlate
to the observed behavior. Following melt-annealing, the (primary)
lamellar stacking distances of all the materials converge to approximately
16 Å. This suggests that the thermodynamically preferred lamellar
stacking distance of all four materials does not vary significantly.
However, the as-cast lamellar stacking distances are different. The
lamellar stacking distances of as-cast N0 and N2a lattices are slightly
shorter than the equilibrium distance: 15.5 Å and 14.6 Å,
respectively. On the other hand, the lamellar stacking distances of
the lattices of as-cast N2b and N4 films are almost 2 Å longer:
17.6 Å and 17.9 Å, respectively. The LC of the as-cast N0 and N2a crystallites are also approximately
twice as large as those of the as-cast N2b and N4 crystallites, which
suggests that there is a larger degree of disorder in the latter.
These differences indicate that face-on orientation may be a quenched
metastable state. The degree of variation in the π–π
stacking distance is very small: a range of only 0.3 Å (approximately
2%). This is likely due to the relatively stronger π–π
interactions and the structural similarity of the four conjugated
backbones.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
shown that even though the four N series
molecules have different orientational preferences relative to the
substrate when kinetically trapped during spin-coating, their thermodynamically
preferred orientation is the same. As demonstrated by in situ GIWAXS
measurements, the molecules with inner BT units (N0 and N2a) are able
to achieve the thermodynamically preferred orientation during spin-coating.
However, the molecules with inner PT acceptor units (N2b and N4) are
kinetically trapped in the face-on orientation during spin-coating.
After annealing these films to the melt and then cooling, the resulting
crystallites are oriented edge-on relative to the substrate. Although
there is not yet a mechanistic explanation for the kinetically determined
orientational preferences observed in these organic semiconductors,
it is worth noting that crystallite orientation has been shown to
depend on processing conditions. This study shows such changes within
a series of closely chemically related materials, especially for two
isomers: N2a and N2b. Furthermore, the N series of molecular semiconductors
presents a well-defined, monodisperse system to study crystallite
reorientation that has previously been observed in polydisperse systems.
An understanding of the degree to which organizational preferences
under kinetic control can be preprogrammed through the chemical structure
of molecular semiconductors remains a formidable challenge. However,
it is worth re-emphasizing that such control would open opportunities
to optimize the charge carrier transport in the bulk and thereby relevant
electronic device properties.

Experimental Section
Silicon substrates
(with native oxide) were cleaned by sonication
in piranha solution (3:1 H2SO4/H2O2), acetone, and isopropanol for approximately 5 min
each. The substrates were subsequently dried in an oven at 130 °C
and cleaned via UV–ozone treatment for 30 min each. The substrates
were then brought into a glovebox under N2 atmosphere,
where the films were deposited via spin-coating at 1500 rpm for 60
s from chloroform solutions (10 mg/mL) of each material.

GIWAXS
measurements were taken at beamline 11-3 of the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource using a charge coupled device detector
with a beam energy of 12.4 keV. The films were melt-annealed by heating
the stage above the melting point of the material (confirmed by no
X-ray diffraction) and then allowing it to cool back down to ambient
temperature.
