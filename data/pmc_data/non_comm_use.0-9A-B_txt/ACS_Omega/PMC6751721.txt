The
hitherto unknown influence of 1,10-phenonthroline (1,10-phen)
and its derivatives on the weak chemiluminescence (CL) of periodate-peroxide
has been investigated, and a novel method for CL catalysis is described.
Herein, we have deconvoluted the variation in CL intensity arising
from the addition of various derivatives of 1,10-phen. Interestingly,
similar derivatives of 1,10-phen show interesting differences in their
reactivity toward CL. Electron-withdrawing substituents on 1,10-phen
boosted the CL signals, indicating a negative charge buildup on 1,10-phen
in the rate-determining step. The 1,10-phen derivatives having substitution
at the C5=C6 position resulted in no
CL signals due to the blockage of the reactive site. Mechanistic investigations
are interpreted in terms of free radical (H2O2 reaction), followed by the oxygen atom transfer via an electrophilic
attack of IO4– (IO4– reaction) on 1,10-phen resulting in dioxetane with enhanced CL emission.
Additionally, the relationship between electronic structures and photophysical
properties was investigated using density functional theory. Our results
are expected to open up promising application of 1,10-phen as a molecular
catalyst, providing a new strategy for metal-free catalytic CL enhancement
reaction. We believe that this would foster in gleaning more detailed
information on the nature of these reactions, thereby leading to a
deeper understanding of the CL mechanism.

1 Introduction
The
chemistry of 1,10-phenanthroline (1,10-phen) has got considerable
attention due to its interesting nature and numerous applications.1,2 1,10-Phen is an important chelating agent that can form coordination
compounds with a multitude of metal ions.3 Despite the rich chemistry, the oxidation product of 1,10-phen has
been challenging due to the competing reaction of the most reactive
C5th and C6th centers with N atoms present in
the ring. Its oxidation usually leads to the opening of the middle
ring or dearomatization. The unique behavior was due to the rigid
structure and limited space in the bay area of the 1,10-phen that
cannot accommodate two O atoms.2 Nevertheless,
peroxo compounds have been reported to typically results in the oxidation
of one N atom.2 This may be due to the
involvement of different poles of 1,10-phen in different reactions.
The 1,10-phen derivatives are dipolar organic molecules with strong
electron-withdrawing N atoms4 and low lying
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which act as single-electron-transfer
mediators.5 The cis-locked nature of the
1,10-phen core provides several distinct structural and chemical benefits.2,6 Phenanthroline-based compounds show high electron mobility7 and have been used as energy-transfer reagents.8,9

Enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) is a significant analytical
technique
in biological, environmental, and forensic analyses due to its sensitivity,
simple instrumentation,10,11 forgo excitation source,10,12 and higher signal-to-noise ratio.12,13 However, most
of the important CL systems suffer from challenges of weak CL intensity,
which limits their applications.11 Over
the last few years, we have been interested in the enhancement of
weak CL using nanomaterials.14−17 Among the weak CL systems, peroxide-induced systems
are most important, widely investigated, and extensively used.18,19 Despite the great progress, the assignment of CL properties to structural
features is often uncertain, and the understanding of the structural
and functional variations in a compound with their corresponding CL
behavior remains elusive. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge,
the interesting trends of 1,10-phen with varying degrees and patterns
of substitution on the CL study have not been thoroughly investigated.

Herein, the weak CL from the periodate–peroxide reaction
was greatly enhanced by the application of 1,10-phen and its derivatives.
The possible CL enhancement mechanism was discussed based on the electrochemical/optical
results, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), UV–vis
absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and CL spectra, as well as the
effect of radical scavengers on the 1,10-phen-catalyzed periodate–peroxide
CL system, suggesting that CL might originate from the catalytic activity
of 1,10-phen derivatives to decompose H2O2 to
hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and the reaction of these
radicals with the 1,10-phen derivatives to form dioxetane in the excited
state. This is the first example of 1,10-phen as a catalyst and unique
compared with the previously reported catalyst in CL. It is noteworthy
that the present system requires neither the participation of a metal
catalyst nor the use of complicated reagents. Furthermore, the catalytic
process that does not require a transition metal as a catalyst is
important because of its cost-effectiveness and metal-free nature.20 Moreover, the development of nanomaterial- and
metal-free processes is expected to significantly change the strategies
for CL enhancement.

(DCTB), and phenanthrene (Sigma-Aldrich) were purchased and used as
such. All solutions were prepared in distilled water.

2.2 CL Analysis
The CL kinetic curves
were obtained by batch experiments, which were carried out in a glass
cuvette. The CL profiles were displayed at 1300 V negative voltage
of the photomultiplier tube and integrated at 0.1 s intervals. For
the CL study, 50 μL of H2O2 and 50 μL
of 1,10-phen were premixed and then 50 μL of IO4– was injected by a microliter syringe from the injector
port, or otherwise specified. The CL studies of all compounds were
carried out in the same experimental conditions. Various parameters
influencing the CL signals, including the order of mixing reagent,
pH, and concentration, were optimized.

2.3 EPR Analysis
Electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was carried out using a JEOL JES-FA200
spectrometer (conditions: microwave power, 1.0 mW; modulation amplitude,
1.0 G; and receiver gain, 1.00e+05) by mixing H2O2, IO4–, DMPO, and 1,10-phen
derivatives in different mixing orders. The sample tube was filled
with the reaction mixture and the analysis carried out at room temperature
or otherwise specified temperature.

know the final product of the reaction mixture. The sample was uniformly
mixed with trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]-malononitrile
(DCTB) as a matrix. For MALDI analysis, the sample and matrix were
mixed in a 1:1 ratio. One microliter of the sample was spotted directly
onto a stainless steel plate and allowed to dry in air at room temperature.
Individual spectra of all reagents were recorded and compared with
those of the reaction mixtures.

measured with a BPCL luminescence analyzer (Institute of Biophysics,
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China). A F-7000 fluorescence
spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan) was used for the photoluminescence
(PL) study, and absorption spectra were recorded by a UV-3900s spectrophotometer
(Hitachi, Japan). Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis was performed
on a JEOL JES-FA200 ESR spectrometer (ESP-300E, Bruker, Japan). Mass
spectrometry was performed on MALDI-TOF-MS (Shimadzu Biotech Axima,
Japan). Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a Zahner
IM6 potentiostat (Zahner Elektrik GmbH & Co. KG-Kronach, Germany).
The CL spectra were recorded by a F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer
(Hitachi, Japan) at a closed light source in a flow cell connected
to peristaltic pumps.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 CL Profile of 1,10-Phen-Mixed Periodate–Peroxide
System
The weak CL from the periodate–peroxide reaction
was enhanced by 1,10-phen and the mechanism analyzed (Scheme 1). No CL signals were observed
in the mixture of 1,10-phen with IO4– or H2O2. The weak CL intensity of the IO4––H2O2 system
was increased approximately 30 times by 1,10-phen, which was further
boosted in a basic medium (∼160 times). Conversely, the acidic
medium caused a decrease in the CL signals (Figure 1a). The oxidation of 1,10-phen derivatives
is associated with the acid–base equilibria.1 Protonation of 1,10-phen is expected to hinder the oxidation,
making it less reactive.2 Presumably, the
higher sluggishness of Hphen+ compared to that of 1,10-phen
in neutral and basic media is a consequence of the low CL intensity,
which efficiently hinders the attack of oxidant on 1,10-phen.1,2 Second, a lower pH suppresses the production of free radicals and
reduces IO4–.18 On the other hand, the high stability of free radicals in a basic
medium boosted the CL signals. Likewise, the generation of free radicals
in the base-mediated transformation of IO4– to IO3–21 also contributed to the high CL signals.

Scheme 1 Mechanism of Enhancement
of Periodate–Peroxide CL System in
the Presence of 1,10-phen
(a) CL enhancement in the presence
of 1,10-phen proceeded through the •OH radical pathway,
followed by the complexation of IO4– resulting
in dioxetane with enhanced CL emission. (b) 1O2 reaction with 1,10-phen. (c) •O2– radical pathway for the CL enhancement reaction of
1,10-phen.

To know the effect of different
mixing orders on the CL intensity,
different injection orders were analyzed (Figure 1b). The highest CL intensity was obtained
when IO4– was injected into the H2O2–1,10-phen mixture due to the decomposition
of H2O2 on 1,10-phen. The injection of H2O2 into the IO4––1,10-phen
mixture resulted in the second highest CL intensity. Lastly, the injection
of 1,10-phen into the H2O2–IO4– solution resulted in very poor signals due to
the addition of 1,10-phen after the manifestation of the reaction.
However, the effect of an acid–base was very different in the
case of the order of injections. The maximum CL intensity was observed
when IO4– was injected into the 1,10-phen–H2O2 mixture in a basic medium, but very low signals
were observed in the case of the injection of H2O2 due to the unavailability of IO4– in
an alkaline medium (Figure S1). To better
understand the CL properties of the 1,10-phen-enhanced periodate–peroxide
system, the emitting species in the system were initially studied
by the CL spectrum by monitoring the CL intensity with respect to
the wavelength by continuously flowing the reagent into a flow cell.
The CL spectrum of the enhanced system has the same emission as that
of 1,10-phen, pointing out that the final emission is from 1,10-phen
(Figure 1c).

3.2 CL Mechanism
Before entering into
the mechanistic interpretations of our results, we enumerate briefly
the salient features observed in Result section. (1) The CL properties in the presence of a substituted 1,10-phen
are different than those of the parent 1,10-phen. (2) Not only the
substitution but also the position of N on 1,10-phen affects the CL
intensity of the system. (3) There are no CL signals for the 1,10-phen
derivatives in which substitutions are at the 5th and 6th C-atoms. (4) The CL signals decrease with electron-donating
groups and vice versa. (5) pH has a different effect on the CL properties
of different substituted 1,10-phen derivatives. The CL enhancement
obtained here is expected to follow a completely different reaction
route than the conventional metal- and nanomaterial-catalyzed systems.

It is well-known that the CL system usually requires the involvement
of oxidants, such as H2O2.11 To confirm that the CL behavior was only due to H2O2 or IO4–, separate effect
of each of these reagents with 1,10-phen was checked (Figure 1). No CL signals in the case
of only H2O2 or IO4– with 1,10-phen suggested that the combined effect of H2O2 and IO4– resulted in an
enhanced emission from the 1,10-phen-enhanced CL system. It could
be suggested that the role of H2O2 in the CL
emission was possibly associated with the generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS). In the reaction of H2O2, extensive
oxidation of the aromatic ring occurs,22 involving the cleavage of the peroxo (O–O) bond of H2O2 and the C–O bond formation. 1,10-Phen
facilitated the generation of radicals by electron transfer.20 However, for small molecules in solution, which
undergo electron transfer, Marcus theory is usually an effective model.23 1,10-phen derivatives are oxidized to radical
cations by the transfer of an electron to H2O2,22 producing –OH and •OH radicals, which, in turn, cause the oxidational
destruction of 1,10-phen at its most reactive C5=C6 bond to from 5,6-dihydro-1,10-phen-5,6-diol.

To thoroughly
understand the CL mechanism, radicals that may be
formed in the CL system, i.e., superoxide radicals (•O2–), •OH radical,
and singlet oxygen (1O2), which were identified
by EPR spectroscopy and free radical scavenger studies.24 The enhanced CL emission generally involves
the increased production of free radicals, i.e., •OH, •O2–, and substrate
radicals.18 The confirmation was done by
the addition of one equivalent ascorbic acid and thiourea (•OH radical scavengers), which completely inhibit the CL intensity
(Table S1). Ascorbic acid and thiourea
can be oxidized by radicals, utilizing the produced radicals, which
resulted in inhibited CL signals.11,22 Similarly,
the decrease in the CL signals in the presence of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) and nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT) also confirmed
the presence of free radicals in the system. The addition of 1,10-phen
to IO4–/H2O2/DMPO
mixture results in much lower CL intensities, confirming the efficient
utilization of the radicals by 1,10-phen.

In the IO4––H2O2 system, a four-line
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectrum with g = 2.0057 and a hyperfine splitting AN = 14.8 G with a 1:2:2:1 quartet peak (characteristic
of DMPO–•OH) was attributed to •OH radicals (Figure 2a).11,25 The addition of 1,10-phen to the IO4––H2O2 mixture
demonstrates a substantial decrease in radicals compared to the IO4––H2O2 mixture,
indicating that •OH radicals lead to the oxidation
of 1,10-phen. In other combinations, •OR radicals
were formed and the basic medium revealed a new signal with g = 2.0058 and AN = 8.5 G corresponding
to the DMPO/•OOH adduct (Figure 2b).25 Free radicals
were produced in the reaction of some 1,10-phen derivatives (Figure 2c), but the inability
of these radicals to form emissive species, due to the blockage of
the reactive site (C5=C6), resulted in
low CL signals. Therefore, not only the generation of free radicals
but also the reaction of these radicals to form emissive species is
critical for the enhanced CL emission. Therefore, pathway a in Scheme S1 is a prominent possibility. Conversely,
there are chances of synchronous concerted or merged mechanism, involving
simultaneous O–O′ and C5=C6 bond extensions followed by rupture of the former to form products
(Scheme S1b).26 The free radical studies reject this mechanism to be following here.

(d) Cyclic voltammetry of the CL system in different combinations.

As reported by Bokare et al., the oxidation of
organic diol involves
the formation of a cyclic diol–periodate monoester, which further
undergoes a base-catalyzed rearrangement to form an unstable intermediate
complex.21 The base-catalyzed cyclic rearrangement
needs alkaline conditions, thus the CL intensity increases in basic
conditions. The electrophilic attack of IO4– on the glycol oxygen of 5,6-dihydro-1,10-phen-5,6-diol (α-diol)
forms a transient intermediate as a cyclic complex. This uninegatively
charged complex undergoes a rearrangement to form dioxetane, which
spontaneously decomposes into products. The trans-β-H elimination
and reoxidation of 5,6-dihydroxy-1,10-phen-5,6-diol by IO4– coordination provide oxidation product (1,10-phen-5,6-diol).
This was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS, and the two new peaks appearing
at m/z 215.06 and 235.04 belong to H.1,10-phen(OH)2+ and Na.1,10-phen(O)2+, respectively,
in the reaction mixture of 1,10-phen with H2O2 and IO4– (Figure S2). The chemiexcitation relies on electron transfer,13 and the large activation entropies are characteristic
of 2e– oxidation, i.e., O-atom transfer.1,2 The 2e– oxidations require one molecule of IO4– in which an I atom is reduced from +7
to +5 (reduction to IO3–).

1,10-Phen
itself gives no redox reaction in cyclic voltammetry
(CV), but the addition of H2O2 changes the onset
of the current values (Figure 2d). The addition of IO4– significantly
changed the redox behavior of 1,10-phen with two reduction peaks at
−0.6 and −1 V, which correspond to the reduction of
IO4– (Figure S3). However, addition of IO4– to a premixed
1,10-phen–H2O2 solution resulted in a
higher oxidation current and a clear oxidation peak at 0.6 V, which
correspond to the new product formed. Furthermore, enhancement in
the oxidation current upon addition of IO4– to the 1,10-phen–H2O2 solution confirms
that H2O2 and IO4– promote the oxidation of 1,10-phen, which also supports our proposed
mechanism.

The intermediate to be concluded as a cyclic diester
of periodic
acid or its hydrated form, if not so, a liable charge-transfer complex
between IO4– and quinone, would conceivably
be the intermediate (Scheme 2i). The decomposition of the intermediate is rather sensitive
to acidity. Three paths of the decomposition of the diester intermediate
based on H+ and –OH ion concentrations
are proposed (Scheme 2ii−iv). The protonated form of the intermediate complex should
decompose more readily than the unprotonated one because the former
process does not correspond to dioxetane formation. The decrement
of the CL intensity in acidic media and vice versa proves the validity
of the –OH-catalyzed decomposition of intermediates,
hence a base-assisted H-bond cleavage was found to be the key step,
which was reflected in general base catalysis of the overall reaction.

It is also probable that excitation occurs directly
through the
interaction of 1,10-phen with 1O2, possibly
from the IO4––H2O2 reaction to produce CL.22 Dioxetane
could be formed from 1,10-phen by reaction with 1O2, the latter readily forms a dioxetane adduct with most double-bond
organic compounds.22 If so, the decrease
in the rate of 1O2 should decrease the CL intensity
and vice versa. It was noted that the CL intensity increased by the
addition of NaN3 (Table S1),
an inhibitor of 1O2. This excluded the possibility
that 1O2 was involved in the CL reaction (Scheme 1b).

It seems
to follow that the immediate radical, •O2–, is an active reducing agent; however,
it can also function as an oxidizing agent in oxidational destruction
of aromatic compounds. The proof of the participation of •O2– in the concerned reaction here was
obtained by studying the effect of NBT and DMPO, effective acceptors
of •O2–. Addition of
NBT and DMPO to the system suppresses the CL intensity (Table S1), which strengthens the assumption that
CL arises through the interaction of •O2– and •OH with 1,10-phen. The
reaction of 1,10-phen and •O2–, beginning with the addition at C5=C6 bond, proceeding reversibly to only a small fraction of 1,10-phen
existing in radical adduct form at any time, followed by rearrangement
of the adduct to peroxide. Subsequent disproportionation of two peroxide
radicals leads to the unstable dioxetane, which then breakdowns to
emit in a subsequent nonlimiting step (Scheme 1c).22 However,
the very low EPR signals of the •O2– radical revealed that the this pathway contributes
very little and occurs concomitantly with the main •OH radical pathway (Scheme 1a).

Lastly, the N-heterocyclic aromatic compounds convert
to N oxides
by reaction with peracids.22 It was, therefore,
possible that such oxides might be formed from 1,10-phen in our system.
The high steric repulsion between the “bay-region” and
the low CL intensity in the presence of 1,10-phen compounds with substitutions
at the 5th or 6th C-atoms (entries 1–4, Figure 1d) excluded this
possibility.

3.3 Effect of Various Derivatives
of 1,10-Phen
on CL
A broad range of 1,10-phen derivatives, including those
bearing high degree of functionality, are tried in the reaction to
track the effectiveness of various substituents on the electronic
and steric properties of the 1,10-phen derivatives with their oxidation
and consequently on CL intensity (Figure 1d). The electronic features affect the reactivities
of the 1,10-phen derivatives, and substitutions in different regions
explain the selectivity of the reaction site and thereby drastically
obvious CL signals. The presence of substituents at some critical
positions (5th, 6th C-atoms, i.e., entries 1–4
in Figure 1d) on 1,10-phen
covers the active site of oxidation, resulting in no CL signals, thus
providing the evidence of a reaction at this site. McCann et al. suggested
that increasing conjugation at 5- and 6-positions of 1,10-phen may
not be a suitable strategy for its activity.27 Likewise, the oxidation of phenanthrene exclusively occurs in the
K-region due to the most olefinic and less aromatic character of this
bond and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO located
in this region.28,29 Taking the olefinic nature of
the C5=C6 position into account, attack
of the •OH radical species across this region of
1,10-phen most likely occurs, and the subsequent deprotonation processes
(by IO4–) would afford the oxidation
product (Scheme 1a).

The lower CL signals of neocuproine put forward the role of two
methyl groups, which donate electrons. The electron-donating groups
decrease the acid strength compared to unsubstituted 1,10-phen.1 Moreover, the electron donor produces a multidirectional
charge transfer, which results in a high degree of electron delocalization
and the subsequent protonation of 1,10-phen.1 Conversely, the electron-withdrawing groups (−Cl, −OH)
on 1,10-phen resulted in high CL signals. The electron-withdrawing
groups decrease the electron density,3 increasing
the electron mobility and the nucleophilic nature7 of 1,10-phen to make it more acidic.30 Strong electrophilic substituents enhance the acidity of
the H atom on the C5=C6 position and
lead to enhanced CL signals. This is also consistent with base-catalyzed
reaction, i.e., a high pH increases the CL intensity and vice versa.
The CL enhancement induced by electron-withdrawing substituents on
1,10-phen is in accordance with what would be expected if 1,10-phen
acted as a nucleophile in the rate-determining step. The 4,7-Phen
has a pendant proton in close proximity to N, which is close to the
active site, generate an intramolecular H-bond and causes enlarged
resonance. The H bond stabilizes the high-energy transition state
and thus results in high CL signals. Likewise, in 4,7-dihydroxy-1,10-phen,
two hydroxyl substituents are spatially suitable for H-bonding with
the H of the reactive C atoms (C5=C6),
which are prone to chemical reactions.

3.4 Spectral
Studies
As a supplement
to CL study, a series of spectral studies were performed to better
understand the mechanism of the system. The absorption at ∼285
nm for all compounds31−33 was attributed to the electronic transition from
the ground state (π,So) to the excited state (π*,S1) of 1,10-phen.8,34 However, the absorption bands
at 330 nm of 5-nitro-1,10-phen and 298 of 1,10-phen-5,6-dione can
be attributed to the n−π* transition of the oxygen atom.32 A red shift from 1,10-phen to its electron-donating
substituted compound implies that the introduction of an electron
donor is beneficial to reducing the absorption energy.32 There was no peak in the visible region of all
mixtures, implying that there are no charge-transfer bands (Figure S4). Thus, it is clear that 1,10-phen
has no complexation, even at different combinations.

UV–vis
spectra showed two independent absorbing species in the reaction (Figure S4), and these experimental results are
consistent with photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Figure S5).2 In the PL study, the
emission spectra were obtained by monitoring the excitation wavelength
from 260 to 500 nm with 20 nm increment. On variation of the excitation
intensity, variable emission intensity was observed along with a bathochromic
shift. In the PL spectra, upon excitation at λ ≥ 260
nm, 1,10-phen produced luminescence, which decreased in intensity
with increase in excition wavelength. This emission was assigned to
the π–π* luminescence, derived from 1,10-phen moiety.35 Different emissions may be suggestive of different
origins.35

3.5 Theoretical
Studies
DFT calculations
were performed to further support the experimental outcomes (Figure 3). The complexation
of IO4– with 1,10-phen-5,6-diol is highly
exothermic and releases significant amount of energy, which provides
energy for the formation of high-energy excited state. The electron
densities in the HOMO are delocalized over the entire molecule, whereas
the distributions in the LUMO appear to be at the C5=C6 positions. The OH groups when substituted at the C5th and C6th positions in the 1,10-phen give the most stable
configuration. Similarly, the OH-substituted 1,10-phen was further
treated with IO4– and the results support
the fact that C5th and C6th give the most stable
products (Figure 3).

4 Conclusions
A new reactivity pattern in the
context of 1,10-phen as well as
a novel approach for CL enhancement using 1,10-phen as a catalyst
is described. The various derivatives of 1,10-phen led to enhanced
CL signals from the IO4––H2O2 reaction. The CL enhancement is due to the degradation
of 1,10-phen by •OH radical through a radical-based
mechanism. Importantly, the oxidation of 1,10-phen proceeds at a higher
rate in a basic medium compared to that in neutral and acidic media.
Consequently, the CL intensity increased in a basic medium and vice
versa. In the course of these studies, we determined that the C5=C6 bond of 1,10-phen is mainly responsible
for the CL reaction to results in the enhanced emission. The CL retardation
when substituents are attached at specific position (C5=C6 bond), blocking up the reaction site, resulted
in no CL signals. A reaction sequence initiated by single-electron
transfer from 1,10-phen to H2O2 produces •OH radical and its reaction with 1,10-phen, followed
by the reduction of the IO4–-bound 1,10-phen
complex, which then undergoes a rapid reaction to give dioxetane with
enhanced CL emission. The findings are a breakthrough in the CL catalysis
using organic materials and will encourage further consideration to
analyze certain chemical reactions, especially those involving organic
molecules in excited states. We believe that this will aid in the
development and search of more active catalysts.
