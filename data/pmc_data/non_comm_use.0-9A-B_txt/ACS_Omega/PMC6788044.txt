Several MnO2 catalysts,
promoted with Pb2+ ions and supported on a wash-coated
monolith (WMon), briefly, xPbyMn-WMon
(x = 0, 0.5,
1.0, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 and y = 8 wt %), were prepared.
The presence of Pb2+ affects the manganese oxidation state,
crystalline phase, thermal resistance, metal dispersion, and catalytic
performance. According to XPS spectra, XRD patterns and HRTEM images,
manganese was dispersed on the monolith surface as Mn3+ and Mn4+ species in both α and β crystalline
phases. The ratios of Mn4+/Mn3+ states and α/β phases were highly enhanced, and the desired PbxMn8O16 phase (coronadite)
was formed. Concentrations of the defect oxygen (Mn–O–H)
and oxygen vacancies, which improve the catalyst reducibility and
the MnO2 reduction temperature, were also increased. Further,
based on the H2 chemisorption analysis, the Pb2+ template would increase the manganese dispersion and the reaction
sites. Meanwhile, the average MnO2 crystallite size was
decreased from 13.26 to 8.15 nm. The optimum catalyst 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon
exhibited an activity 149% more than the manganese-only catalyst in
decomposition of H2O2. Evaluation of catalyst
stability in the presence of Pb2+ after 10 recycles showed
only a 6.8% decrease. The catalytic reaction was evaluated based on
different criteria.

1 Introduction
Considering the environmental protection consciousness, hydrogen
peroxide as an eco-friendly liquid is used in various industrial processes.
These include water and wastewater treatments, the oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) in electrochemical cells, power generation processes,
and as an oxidant in some oxidation–reduction processes.1−3 Therefore, catalyzing this reaction improves its efficiency and
industrial applications. Over many years, various metals have been
used as catalysts and facilitators for this reaction. Among them,
manganese with special properties like multivalance capability, nontoxicity,
high stability, and structural flexibility is known as a promising
catalyst.4

Manganese exists in different
valence states of 2+ in MnO, 3+ in
Mn2O3, and 4+ in MnO2. Through different
states of manganese oxide, MnO2 is the most stable phase,
which gives the lowest H2O2 decomposition activation
energy (∼50 kJ/mol).5 MnO2 adopts an amorphous or a variety of crystalline forms, depending
on the linkage and placement of MnO6 octahedral units.6 The crystalline forms of MnO2 include
α, β, γ, and δ that are described as [2 ×
2], [1 × 1], [1 × 2], and [1 × ∞] MnO6 unit tunnel structures, respectively.
These structural features are nicely discussed in ref (5). Studies on electrode materials
indicate that the MnO2 crystalline form controls the oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) and the parallel H2O2 decomposition kinetics in electrochemical cells.6

The most probable mechanism of H2O2 decomposition
over the manganese oxide catalyst is briefly described in the following
equations.7,8 In the first steps, Mn4+ changes
to Mn3+, and then the catalyst replenishment occurs in
the presence of the HO· radical, leading Mn3+ to convert to Mn4+ (eq 4). Nevertheless, at the beginning of the reaction,
due to the low concentration of radicals, the rate of the catalyst
replenishment is rather low. To accelerate this, the presence of the
optimum concentration of Mn3+ species and accelerating
the Mn4+/Mn3+ redox transition in the MnO2 catalyst are crucial.8 Thus, it
can easily be concluded that the activity of MnO2 depends
on its crystalline form, average oxidation state (AOS), Mn4+/Mn3+ redox transition ability, particle size, and surface
area that are controllable during preparation of catalysts.6,9

 1   2   3   4   5   6  During H2O2 decomposition, because of local
pressure and temperature rising, the catalyst undergoes mechanical
and thermal shocks, which cause its cracking and active-phase sintering.
To avoid the first case, use of macropore monoliths with cordierite
composition (2MgO·2Al2O3·5SiO2) has been suggested with regard to high mechanical, thermal,
and chemical resistance and low mass transfer limitations.10 Further, to decrease the manganese sintering,
the metal surface dispersion or metal–support interaction should
be improved. For this aim, aluminum oxide-wash-coated monoliths provide
a high surface area with active anchoring sites.11

On the other hand, calcination at high temperatures
may cause MnO2-phase sintering, transition from δ
to α and β,
and eventually formation of Mn2O3, an undesired
phase for H2O2 decomposition.12,13 As a matter of interest, studies on electrode materials have revealed
that the presence of cationic templates like H+, NH4+, Li+, K+, Na+, and Ba2+ during the synthesis can control the manganese
dioxide crystalline form and thus inhibits the undesired effects of
high calcination temperatures. Large cations like K+, Na+, Ba2+, and Ag+ can support the formation
of an α-MnO2 tunnel framework.14−16 It has been
shown that for instance, inserting a K+ template into the
α-MnO2 tunnel increases the phase transition temperature
up to 580 °C.17 Then, using a large
multivalence cationic template can support the α-MnO2 tunnel structure and improve the thermal resistance of MnO2 as well as the Mn4+/Mn3+ redox transition
in the α-MnO2 structure.17 Among the large cations, Pb2+ as a cost-effective and
multivalence cation could be an attractive option for the formation
of the α-MnO2 structure and for improving the Mn4+/Mn3+ redox transition, which is desired for hydrogen
peroxide decomposition.

In this research, different amounts
of Pb2+ templates
are used to control the MnO2 crystalline structure and
the AOS. Enhancement in the catalytic performance could be due to
the structural and electronic effects of Pb2+ on manganese
oxide. Accordingly, MnO2 catalysts, promoted with Pb2+ and supported on a wash-coated monolith (WMon), briefly, xPbyMn-WMon (x = 0, 0.5,
1.0, 1.5, 2, and 2.5, and y = 8 wt %), are synthesized
by the sequential wetness impregnation method, and their physicochemical
properties are properly investigated. The catalyst samples are evaluated
for H2O2 decomposition based on different criteria.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
Results of ICP,
BET surface area measurement, and textural properties of the support
and catalysts are listed in Table 1. The ICP analysis of fresh catalysts shows that the
amounts of Mn and Pb were fairly close to the nominal contents. Also,
to ensure the lack of lead in the reaction solution and thus its toxicity,
the ICP analysis for the used catalysts, after four times cycling,
was carried out. As Table 1 shows, a very low decrease in the metal content, within the
experimental errors, confirms the stability of synthesized catalysts.

According to the BET results, wash coating the support increases
the surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter that are due to the
high surface area of porous alumina, which is established by micro/mesopores.18 By adding manganese, the surface area and pore
volume decrease from 51.23 to 27.86 m2 g–1 for WMon and 0.27 to 0.14 m3 g–1 for
0Pb8Mn-WMon. This decrease denotes that some pores of the wash-coated
layer are blocked by manganese oxide clusters. This is because the
surface area of catalysts and pore volume are increased by adding
Pb2+, which may be due to the different spreading of Pb2+ and manganese oxide on the wash-coated monolith that prevents
manganese oxide-phase sintering and pore blockage.19 This result reflects the structural promoting effect of
Pb2+ on the manganese catalyst. Among the prepared catalysts,
the 1Pb8Mn-WMon catalyst gives the highest surface area and pore volume.
Further, according to the BET results, the average pore diameter increases
by loading Pb2+. This can be attributed to the blockage
of small pores or forming a new manganese oxide porous layer on the
support surface. Thus, the average pore diameter becomes larger than
that of the manganese oxide-only catalyst.

The XRD pattern of
the lead-free catalyst shows peaks related to
Mn2O3 and different crystalline phases of MnO2, marked in Figure 1.20 Since the matrix and the synthesis
method of catalysts and the used XRD device were the same for all
the samples, the intensity of peaks can be used to make a relative
comparison of the phases in the catalysts. By adding Pb2+, the peak intensity of MnO2 phases increases, while that
of Mn2O3 decreases. In fact, the decrease of
Mn2O3 peak intensity is attributed to the structural
promoting effect of Pb2+, which causes better manganese
dispersion and, in turn, improves the accessibility of the manganese
metal to the present surrounding oxygen during preparation and changing
the manganese state form Mn2O3 to MnO2.21 Comparing XRD patterns of 0Pb8Mn-WMon
and 0.5Pb8Mn-WMon indicates an increase in the α-MnO2 peak intensity and the formation of a new PbxMn8O16 phase (coronadite) where x is the number of Pb2+, determined by ICP, per
the structural formula of Mn8O16 in the prepared
catalysts (0.12 < x < 0.64). Indeed, the Pb2+ template can provide anchoring and nucleation sites for
MnO6 units to form α-MnO2 large tunnels
during the synthesis, then Pb2+ is absorbed in the α-MnO2 tunnel, and the coronadite phase is formed.14,22 The α-MnO2 peak intensity increases with Pb2+ loading up to 1.5 wt % and then decreases, while the intensity
of PbxMn8O16 was
constant after 1.5 wt %. Further, a new peak at 2θ = 53.2°
appears for 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon and 2Pb8Mn-WMon catalysts, which is attributed
to the PbO phase according to the X’pert reference database.23 This matter can happen because (a) almost the
entire support surface has been occupied by α-MnO2 and there has been no enough space for new α-MnO2 tunnels to absorb Pb2+ ions and (b) α-MnO2 reaches a maximum capacity of Pb2+ absorption. Under
this condition, some of the Pb2+ ions are stable on the
surface as a PbO phase, which occupies parts of the support surface
and shows an adverse effect on the manganese dispersion. This could
increase the probability of manganese agglomeration and thus Mn2O3 phase formation, which appears in XRD patterns.

of the different prepared catalysts.

Further information on the composition of the catalysts was obtained
from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The XPS
spectra of 0Pb8Mn-WMon and 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon reveal the existence of O,
Mn, Al, C, and Pb that are marked in Figure 2a,b. Detailed high-resolution XPS of Mn 3s
(Figure 2c,d), Mn 2p
(Figure 2e,f), and
O 1s (Figures 2g,h)
was carried out to determine the oxidation state of Mn and the concentration
of the oxygen vacancy in the samples.

Figure 2 XPS spectra of (a) 0Pb8Mn-WMon and (b)
1.5Pb8Mn-WMon catalysts;
Mn 3s spectra for (c) 0Pb8Mn-WMon and (d) 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon, Mn 2p spectra
for (e) 0Pb8Mn-WMon and (f) 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon, and O 1s spectra for (g)
0Pb8Mn-WMon and (h) 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon.

The AOS of Mn was estimated based on the spectrum of the Mn 3s
region and following the formula AOS = 8.956 – 1.126ΔES where ΔES is the binding energy difference between the doublet Mn 3s peaks.24 The ΔES values
of MnO, Mn2O3, and MnO2 are 6.0,
5.5, and 4.7 eV, respectively.25 The ΔES value determined in the current XPS spectrum
was 5.06 eV for 0Pb8Mn-WMon and 4.63 eV for 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon. These data
demonstrate that the AOS of Mn changes from 3.26 (in favor of 3+ oxidation
state) to 3.75 (in favor of 4+ oxidation state) in the presence of
Pb2+. The XPS spectra of the Mn 2p peak give rise to a
doublet at different binding energies of 641.8 and 653.4 eV, corresponding
to the Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 states.26 The Mn 2p3/2 XPS of 0Pb8Mn-WMon can
be fitted by three binding energies of 642.7 eV (correlated with Mn4+ in MnO2), 641.3 eV (correlated with Mn3+ in Mn2O3), and 636.8 eV (correlated with Mn2+ in MnO) with molar ratios of 35.7, 58.6, and 5.7, respectively.
Meanwhile, 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon shows only two peaks at 642.4 and 640.8 eV related to the Mn4+ and
Mn3+ with molar percentages of 67.9 and 32.1%. The AOS
of Mn according to the molar ratio of the deconvoluted peak of Mn
2p3/2 is 3.3 for 0Pb8Mn-WMon and 3.68 for 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon,
which confirms the Mn 3s XPS results as well as XRD results. In fact,
manganese decoration by Pb2+ can modify the electron density
around the metal, change the oxidation state, and increase the abundance
of surface Mn4+ as an electronic promoter.27

The O 1s spectrum is often used to determine the
types of surface
oxygen species on the oxides. There are three obvious peaks in Figure 2g,h, which correspond
to lattice oxygen (Mn–O–Mn) (Oα), defect
oxygen (Mn–O–H) (Oβ), and surface-adsorbed
water molecules (H–O–H) (Oβ’)
whose structures are nicely shown in Figure 3. For the samples, binding energies of 529.7–530.1,
531.2–531.8, and 532.4–533.2 eV are attributed to Oα, Oβ, and Oβ’.27,28 The oxygen distribution percentage, reported in Table 2, demonstrates that 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon
contains the most abundant defect oxygen and also oxygen vacancies
because water molecules are usually adsorbed at the oxygen vacancies
of an oxide material.27 As was reported
in the XRD patterns, the presence of Pb2+ supports the
formation of α-MnO2 and PbxMn8O16 phases. PbxMn8O16 maintains neutral charge by forming
Mn3+/Mn4+, Pb2+/Pb3+,
Mn4+/Pb2+, and Mn3+/Pb3+ redox couples and generates the optimal electron availability and
electron mobility at the surface that accelerates the Mn4+/Mn3+ transition and increases the oxygen vacancy.29

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to
determine thermal
stability of the products. The obtained TGA profile (Figure 3) can be divided into three
temperature zones: at temperatures below 200 °C, dehydration
of physically adsorbed surface water occurs; at temperatures within
200–480 °C, the chemisorbed water in the tunnel structure
of MnO2 is removed;30 and at
temperatures higher than 500 °C, the material undergoes decomposition
to form Mn2O3 and then Mn3O4 (MnO2 → Mn2O3 → Mn3O4), which is assigned to the release of the MnO2 lattice oxygen and complete transformation into Mn2O3.17,31 The amount of surface-adsorbed
water in these samples was from 1.15 to 2.2 wt % (Figure 3). In fact, adding Pb2+ to the manganese catalyst increases the surface area and the amount
of surface-adsorbed water. On the other hand, according to the XPS
result, the amounts of oxygen vacancies and the water molecules that
are usually absorbed at the oxygen vacancies increase, and consequently
the TGA mass loss increases. The lead-free sample showed the highest
amount of tunnel water content of 1.53 wt %. In the absence of Pb2+, more vacant tunnel sites are available for water to stabilize
the structure and balance the charge.17 Compared to the lead-free catalyst, the peaks corresponding to the
MnO2 transition to Mn2O3 shift to
higher temperatures, indicating that the lattice oxygen in the PbxMn8O16 phase is more stable
after Pb2+ cations reside in α-MnO2.16 Meanwhile, the mass loss percentage related
to the phase transition increases in the presence of Pb2+.

Figure 4 shows
the
TPR spectra of the prepared catalysts. For the lead-free (0Pb8Mn-WMon)
catalyst, two main peaks are observed. The first at 324 °C with
a shoulder at 375 °C is typically assigned to the reduction of
MnO2 to Mn3O4.32 This peak also includes the reduction of transition-state
Mn2O3, which appears like a shoulder at higher
temperatures. The second peak at 496 °C is typically due to reduction
of Mn3O4 to MnO.20,33 As shown in Figure 4, by adding the Pb2+ template and transfer of the β-MnO2 phase
to α-MnO2, according to XRD results, the reduction
temperature decreases, and catalyst reducibility increases. This electronic
promoting effect of Pb2+ occurs due to the existence of
abundant mobile surface oxygen species in α-MnO2 structures
that are identified in the XPS spectra. Also, the shoulder of the
first appearing peak is related to Mn2O3 phase
reduction that has a significant decrease in H2 uptake
up to 1 wt % Pb2+ loading and then tends to increase, consistent
with XRD patterns. The total H2 consumption for reduction
steps (appropriate to the surface area under each curve) is found
to have the maximum value at 1.5 wt % Pb2+, corresponding
to the higher number of active sites with this amount of Pb2+. TPR spectra of 2Pb8Mn-WMon show a broad peak at 324 °C due
to the probable PbO formation, and the phase reduction peaks overlap.34

Figure 4 TPR profiles of different prepared catalysts.

The results of TPD analysis, presented in Table 3, depict the metal dispersion
and the crystallite
average size. The results indicate that adding Pb2+ to
the manganese catalyst increases the hydrogen uptake, metal dispersion
on the surface, and the number of the manganese oxide crystallites,
which is in accordance with the TPR results. This trend continued
up to 1.5 wt % Pb2+ loading but stopped for an excess amount.
Thus, it implies that Pb2+ by enhancing the MnO2 dispersion provides space and anchoring sites for crystal growth
and forms α-MnO2 large tunnels as well as the coronadite
phase. Higher dispersions and smaller MnO2 crystallite
sizes in the presence of Pb2+ will increase the number
of accessible active sites for H2O2 decomposition.35

The FESEM images and EDX patterns of 0Pb8Mn-WMon as well as the
1.5Pb8Mn-WMon catalyst are shown in Figure 5. Catalysts show different morphologies as
cubic and spherical aggregates of nanoparticles. SEM images in Figure 5a,b reveal that the
Pb2+-loaded samples provide a better dispersion, lower
average size, and a porous layer on the wash-coated monolith surface.
To further explore the manganese distribution on the support surface,
elemental mapping analysis by FESEM was performed. Figure 5c,d shows that the manganese
in the 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon catalyst was distributed more uniformly. Spectra
obtained from EDX (Figure 5e,f) verified that 0Pb8Mn-WMon was made up of 50.27% Mn and
26.22% Al, Si, and Mg, with a mass ratio of Mn/O equal to 2.03, while
1.5Pb8Mn-WMon was made up of 57.69% Mn, 6.12% Pb, and 5.01% Al, Si,
and Mg, with a mass ratio of Mn/O of 1.85. In fact, enormous MnO2 was formed at the surface in the presence of Pb2+.

The TEM images (Figure 6 a,b) of 0Pb8Mn-WMon and 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon catalysts
show remarkably
uniform dispersion of manganese oxide crystals on the monolith surface
that is more obvious for the latter sample. HRTEM images were also
used to detect the interplanar d spacing data of
the MnO2 crystalline structure. In Figure 6c, the lattice fringes correspond to d spacings of 0.31 and 0.69 nm, characteristics of β-MnO2 (110) and α-MnO2 (110) facets, respectively.6,14,36 These results are in agreement
with the XRD pattern for the 0Pb8Mn-WMon catalyst. Also, in some zones,
crystal aggregation is observed. Meanwhile, HRTEM image of the 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon
catalyst (Figure 6d)
shows a smooth texture with one dominant crystalline form. In this
catalyst, the interplanar d spacing values in some
zones was estimated to be (∼0.75 nm), while the interplanar d spacing value for the α-MnO2 (110) facet
was 0.69 nm from observations in the HRTEM image of the lead-free
sample. Thus, it is highly possible that the host α-MnO2 tunnel extraction occurs due to the Pb2+ occupation
since the dimension of the tunnels in α-MnO2 is sufficiently
extensive to embed a guest ion.37

2.2 Activity
and Stability Analysis
The
performance of a manganese catalyst is related to the crystalline
form of manganese, the available surface active sites, the manganese
ability to interchange oxidation states (Mn3+/Mn4+), the manganese dispersion percentage, and metal oxide reducibility.38 Here, the prepared Pb2+-loaded and
the manganese-only catalyst performance was evaluated in the experimental
setup under atmospheric pressure and a 5 mL (70%) hydrogen peroxide
injection. The temperature was raised and maintained at 40 ±
3 °C by the cooling water flow. Data were obtained and expressed
in terms of H2O2 conversion (X), reaction constant rate (k), turn over frequency
(TOF), and turn over number (TON).38

H2O2 conversion () was calculated by the O2 mole ratio determined from the rejected water monitored by
a digital scale () to the O2 mole if hydrogen peroxide
was completely decomposed ().39 The ideal
gas law was used to calculate the number of released O2 moles. Here, p is the atmospheric pressure, V is the released O2 volume, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is ambient temperature.
Thus, 7  

Results indicate that H2O2 decomposition
over manganese behaves as a pseudo-first-order reaction for 30 s,
and the reaction rate constant (k) can be expressed
as 8  

In eqs 7 and 8, is the present mole of H2O2 in the solution at time t and is the initial mole
of H2O2.

The turn over frequency (TOF)
can be determined per mole of metal,
but the turn over number (TON) should be calculated per metal active
site according to the following equations23 9   10  where nmetal and NAc are the moles of
metal and the number of metal active sites on the catalyst, respectively.

Figure 7 shows decomposition
conversion of 5 mL of H2O2 in the presence of
different catalyst loadings of Pb2+. The reaction rates
are evidenced by the slopes of their H2O2 conversion
over time curves. Figure 8 shows the H2O2 decomposition conversion
of catalysts after 10, 20, 30, and 40 s using different prepared catalysts.
The activity of the manganese catalyst is remarkably promoted in the
presence of the Pb2+ template. The highest catalytic activity
and almost complete conversion were achieved with the 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon
catalyst where 149% enhancement in conversion (compared to only manganese
catalyst) was achieved after 30 s and a rather complete decomposition
after 40 s.

catalyst loadings of Pb2+.

Figure 8 H2O2 conversion versus different loadings
of Pb2+ at different times.

Table 4 presents
the H2O2 conversion and the reaction rate constant
(k) as well as TOF and TON, all after 30 s during
which the reaction corresponds to pseudo-first-order. From results,
it is obvious that all these criteria increase with Pb2+ content up to 1.5 wt %. Based on the described physicochemical characteristics,
the catalytic activity enhancement in the presence of the Pb2+ template can be attributed to the different structural and electronic
promoting effects as are discussed below.

First of all,
the higher metal dispersion and the more active sites
on the catalyst surface increase the H2O2 accessibility
to the reaction sites.35 However, if the
number of active sites was the only influencing factor, the 1Pb8Mn-WMon
catalyst would exhibit a greater k value than 2Pb8Mn-WMon
based on the TPR and H2 chemisorption results; however,
it was not. Thus, the other promotional effect of Pb2+,
that is, transformation of Mn2O3 into the MnO2 phase, appearing in XRD, XPS and EDX patterns, was relevant.8 According to the XRD patterns, the minimum Mn2O3 phase ratio was relevant to 1Pb8Mn-WMon, but
its activity still appeared to be less than that of 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon.
In this regard, apparently, the role of Pb2+ in increasing
the surface α-MnO2 and the PbxMn8O16 phase formation, which is reflected
by TON and TOF values, is principal.

As shown in Table 4, the 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon catalyst
with the highest ratio of α-MnO2 and PbxMn8O16 phases exhibits the
maximum TON value. Comparing the 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon
and 2Pb8Mn-WMon catalysts with approximately the same quantity of
PbxMn8O16 shows
that the TON value is slightly lower for 2Pb8Mn-WMon, despite a lower
α-MnO2 quantity and a higher Mn2O3 phase. This observation specifies the more important role
of PbxMn8O16 in
the catalyst activity.

Regarding the α-MnO2 phase, the increase of Mn–O–H
groups on the catalyst surface (according to the XPS results) improves
the manganese reducibility (TPR analysis) and the Mn4+ to
Mn3+ transition, which accelerates the H2O2 adsorption on the catalyst surface.40 Also, regarding PbxMn8O16 in which Pb2+ resides in the α-MnO2 tunnel and maintains neutral charge by forming Mn3+/Mn4+, Pb2+/Pb3+, Mn4+/Pb2+, and Mn3+/Pb3+ redox couples,
the optimal electron availability and electron mobility at the catalyst
surface is provided, which increases the oxygen vacancy (localized
Mn3+) in the structure and accelerates the Mn3+ to Mn4+ transition.29

The stability of 0Pb8Mn-WMon and 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon catalysts is typically
compared in Figure 9, for 10 usage cycles and after 30 s of reactions. For the 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon
catalyst, the H2O2 conversion decreased from
92.3 to 86.4 (6.4% decrease), whereas for the 0Pb8Mn-WMon catalyst,
the H2O2 conversion decreased from 37.1 to 17.6
(52.5% decrease). The decrease of catalytic activity could be attributed
to the active site agglomeration and active site occupation with the
intermediates that change the balance of Mn3+ and Mn4+ on the MnO2 crystalline surface.41,42 Based on the structural characterization results, the 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon
catalyst exhibits the best metallic dispersions and the smallest particle
size. Smaller active sites make a stronger interaction with the support
surface and provide anchoring sites, which can reduce the catalyst
mass loss during reaction and decrease the non-favorable metal site
agglomeration.41 Also, the 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon
catalyst with a higher number of oxygen defects and oxygen vacancies
(localized Mn3+) could postpone the active site occupation
and Mn3+ and Mn4+ balance changes and could
improve the catalyst replenishment.42,43

0Pb8Mn-WMon and 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon catalysts in recycles

2.3 Proposed Mechanism for Hydrogen Peroxide Decomposition
As was presented in the structural characterization, adding the
Pb2+ template to the manganese catalyst increases the AOS
and the amount of α-MnO2 phase. Also, the higher
number of oxygen vacancies and defect oxygens was observed in 1.5Pb8Mn-WMon,
which is due to the unique crystalline structure of α-MnO2 and PbxMn8O16 that could maintain the neutral charge in the presence of oxygen
vacancies. Meanwhile, the hydrogen peroxide decomposition is controlled
by the catalyst oxidation state, but the catalyst activity investigation
together with characterization showed that the surface chemistry is
the dominant phenomenon. Thus, the most important parameters to control
the H2O2 decomposition are the oxygen vacancy
(localized on Mn3+) and defect oxygen (Mn–O–H
groups).31,44 The oxygen vacancy facilitates the H2O2 adsorption and the O–O bond dissociation
to form two surface bound hydroxyl radicals (HO·).
Meanwhile, at the defect oxygen sites, the adsorbed H2O2 molecules can provide hydrogen transfer to the O–H
group of Mn–O–H, and a H2O molecule will
be produced as well as a surface bound hydroperoxyl radical (HOO·) from which H2O and O2 molecules
will be generated in the reaction with another adsorbed H2O2 molecule or with a hydroxyl group. Based on these,
the H2O2 decomposition steps on the MnO2 surface are depicted in detail in Figure 10.

on the prepared catalyst.

3 Conclusions
This study explored that the
presence of Pb2+ promotes
the structural and electronic properties of the manganese oxide catalyst.
The H2O2 decomposition activity of a monolithic
supported MnO2 catalyst reaches a maximum at 1.5 wt % Pb2+ loading. According to the physicochemical characterization,
incorporating Pb2+ templates into the manganese catalyst
improves the manganese dispersion, decreases the average particles
size and the number of blocked pores, and supports the formation of
an active α-MnO2 phase. Better dispersion changes
the oxidation state from Mn2O3 to MnO2 by modifying the metal accessibility to the surface oxygen species.
The most outstanding effect was the formation of a new PbxMn8O16 phase, which increases
thermal stability of α-MnO2 and favors the redox
decomposition process due to electron transfers in Mn3+/Mn4+, Pb2+/Pb3+, and Mn4+/Pb2+ couples, leading the oxygen vacancies to appear
at the surface. The new structural defects and the surface oxygen
vacancies accelerate the H2O2 adsorption and
greatly improve the reaction rate as well as the TOF and TON criteria.
The presence of Pb2+ was also relevant to much higher catalytic
stability.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Square channel cordierite
monoliths, as the support for the catalysts, were supplied by Delco
Co. The cylindrical monolith pieces had dimensions of 1 cm diameter
and 0.5 cm length. The support structure contained 600 cells per in.2, and the specific surface area was 37.6 m2 g–1. For making the wash-coat layer, the used γ
alumina (BET = 190 m2 g–1, 99%) and α-alumina
powders (BET = 13 m2 g–1, 99%) were the
products of US Research Nanomaterials, Inc. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA,
98%) for dispersing powders and Mn(NO3)2·4H2O2 (99.0%) and Pb(NO3)2 (≥99.0%)
for the catalyst synthesis were also Merck products. H2O2 solution (70%) was a Degussa AG product. Deionized
water was used for preparing solutions throughout the experiments.

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Catalyst Preparation
For preparing
the xPbyMn-WMon product, the xPbyMn catalyst was synthesized over the
wash-coated cordierite monolith support. Different composite catalysts
were prepared with different Pb2+ loadings of 0, 0.5, 1.0,
1.5, 2, and 2.5 wt %, while a constant Mn loading of 8 wt % was used
for
providing a nearly monolayer of Mn on the support. Before catalyst
preparation, the support was dried at 120 °C in a vacuum oven
overnight to eliminate impurities and humidity. To increase the surface
area of the monoliths and provide a chemically active anchoring site
for metal particles, the monoliths were coated by dipping into stock
aqueous suspensions of alumina prepared by dispersing γ and
α alumina powders and PVA with a 1.5:1:1 mass ratio in 25 mL
of deionized water.11 Stirring the mixture
overnight gave a homogeneous suspension. To achieve good adhesion
of the Al2O3 layer on the monolith substrate,
90% of the alumina powder diameters were less than 4 μm.45 In this way, the surface of the square channel
monoliths was fully covered by a layer of precursor, and then the
support was withdrawn from the stock suspension. After that, the support
was dried at 90 °C for 6 h in a vacuum oven and calcined at 700
°C for 3 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min–1 to eliminate the binder and impurities in a furnace.11

The catalysts were prepared by sequential
impregnation of the support in solutions with specified concentrations
of Mn(NO3)2 and Pb(NO3)2. After impregnation, the products were dried at 90 °C in a
vacuum oven for 10 h and then were calcined at 450 °C for 3 h,
with a heating rate of 3 °C min–1 in a furnace.
The weight of each catalyst piece was ∼200 mg. Figure 11 illustrates the different
steps of the catalyst preparation.

Figure 11 Schematic illustration of the steps of
preparing monolith-supported
catalysts.

4.2.2 Characterization
of Catalysts
The
weight percentages of Mn and Pb metals, deposited on the monolith
surface, were measured by the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) method
using a Varian VISTA-MPX CCD simultaneous instrument. The BET area,
pore volume, and average pore size of the support and prepared catalysts
were determined by the BET surface area and BJH pore size distribution
measurements using a Micromeritics ASAP-2010 system.

A Philips
analytical X-ray diffractometer (XPertMPD) with monochromatized Cu
Kα was used to record the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
the catalysts. Using the XRD pattern, the different formed metal phases
were identified. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were
obtained using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha system. The spectrometer
was equipped with a high-resolution Al Kα X-ray monochromator.
The XPS spectra were recorded under a source energy between 0 and
800 eV with reference to the C 1s peak (285.6 eV). Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was carried out by means of a Linseys STA-1600 apparatus
under air flow in a temperature range of 25–1000 °C at
a rate of 10 °C min–1.

The hydrogen temperature-programmed
reduction (H2-TPR)
analysis was performed using a Micrometrics TPD–TPR 2900 system
equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). First, trace
amounts of water and gases were removed from the catalysts under a
helium atmosphere at 140 °C. After cooling the catalysts, TPR
of samples was obtained in a stream of hydrogen under atmospheric
pressure and a linearly programmed heating of 10 °C min–1 up to 700 °C. The amounts of chemisorbed hydrogen on the catalysts
were also measured. First, the catalyst was reduced under a hydrogen
atmosphere, and then the flow of hydrogen was switched to argon gas
to remove the physisorbed hydrogen. Afterward, temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD) of the samples was performed by increasing the temperature.
The data were used to calculate the metal dispersion, average crystallite
size, and number of crystallites per catalyst mass according to the
following equations:46 11   12   13  where D is
the dispersion percentage of manganese, Ns is the number of surface atoms, Nt is
the total number of atoms in the bulk and on the surface, dVA is the volume-area mean particle size, vm is the volume of an atom, and am is the area occupied by a surface atom. Also, NAc is the number of active surface sites, wt
is the manganese weight per each gram of catalyst (0.08), M is the molar weight of manganese, and NA is the Avogadro number.

Finally, the morphology
of catalysts was observed through field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, MIRA3 Tescan), energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, MIRA3 Tescan at 20 kV), and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Philips Tecnai G2 F20) images.

4.2.3 Experimental Setup
An experimental
setup in which a sample of cylindrical monolith base was coated with
a catalyst was used to examine the hydrogen peroxide decomposition
by monitoring the changes in temperature and O2 production
over time. The setup was made of three main sections (Figure 12):The injection part comprised a delivery tank for holding
the hydrogen peroxide and a solenoid valve. A nitrogen supply was
used to force the hydrogen peroxide through the solenoid valve into
the vessel. The delivery tank was pressurized with nitrogen to a constant
pressure to ensure the complete injection of the hydrogen peroxide.
It was thought that the decomposition products, generated by a very
reactive catalyst, might cause a local increase in pressure. Then,
the injection pressure should be high enough to enter the hydrogen
peroxide impulsively into the decomposition vessel.

The reaction chamber was made of stainless steel with
an inner diameter of 50 mm and an internal height of 70 mm that can
withstand high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. A small vessel
with an internal diameter of 15 mm and a length of 55 mm was embedded
in the center of the reactor. First, a piece of prepared catalyst
was loaded (accurately weighted), then concentrated H2O2 was injected, and the gas products were conducted toward
the exit line. A pod was fixed close to the decomposition vessel to
measure the temperature using a K-type thermocouple. All reactions
were conducted at a temperature of 40 ± 3 °C via a controlled
cooling water flow in the provided jacket around the decomposition
vessel. To ensure compatibility with hydrogen peroxide and its products,
the whole assembly was manufactured with stainless steel grade 316.

In the analyzing section, the generated
gas came out
from the reactor through a brine solution trap for the separation
of H2O and non-converted H2O2, and
the released oxygen was conducted to a water-containing Erlenmeyer
flask where a connection from water to another atmospheric pressure
Erlenmeyer flask was provided and any excess pressure would provide
a flow of water to this Erlenmeyer flask, which was placed on a 0.001
g digital balance to measure the received water due to the oxygen
production. In this way, H2O2 decomposition
was monitored with time.
