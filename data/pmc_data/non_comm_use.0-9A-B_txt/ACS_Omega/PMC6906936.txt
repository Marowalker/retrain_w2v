In this work, poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-stabilized 3–5
nm Rh@Co
core–shell nanoparticles were synthesized by a sequential reduction
method, which was further in situ transformed into Rh-Co2O3 heteroaggregate nanostructures on alumina supports.
The studies of XRD, HAADF-STEM images with phase mappings, XPS, TPR,
and DRIFT-IR with CO probes confirm that the as-synthesized Rh@Co
nanoparticles were core–shell-like structures with Rh cores
and Co-rich shells, and Rh-Co2O3 heteroaggregate
nanostructures are obtained by calcination of Rh@Co nanoparticles
and subsequent selective H2 reduction. The Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 nanostructures demonstrated
enhanced catalytic performance for hydrogenations of various substituted
nitroaromatics relative to individual Rh/Al2O3 and illustrated a high catalytic stability during recycling experiments
for o-nitrophenol hydrogenation reactions. The catalytic
performance enhancement of Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 nanocatalysts is ascribed to the Rh-Co2O3 interfaces where the Rh-Co2O3 interaction
not only prevents the active Rh particles from agglomeration but also
promotes the catalytic hydrogenation performance.

1 Introduction
Catalytic hydrogenation
of substituted nitroaromatics has been
widely used to manufacture the corresponding substituted anilines,
the intermediates for syntheses of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and
dyes.1−4 Typically, supported noble metals such as Pd5,6 and
Pt7−10 are efficient catalysts for hydrogenations of substituted nitroaromatics
but with relatively low selectivity due to nonselective coordination
of functional groups. To improve the catalytic performance of noble
metals, bimetallic nanocatalysts are developed to exploit the metal–metal
interaction to improve the catalytic selectivity.11−15 For example, bimetallic PtSn nanocatalysts exhibit
enhanced selectivity of crotyl alcohol for hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde
due to the Pt-Sn synergic effect.16

Among various bimetallic nanostructures with enhanced catalytic
performances, nanostructures containing metals and metal oxides have
been intensively studied because the metal–metal oxide interfaces
are highly active for some hydrogenation reactions.7,17−21 In the traditional strong metal–support interaction catalysts
(SMSI), reducible supports such as TiO2,22−25 CeO2,26−28 and ZrO229−31 are usually employed, where reducible supports are
partially reduced by H2 at high temperatures and subsequently
the partially reduced support species migrate onto metal surfaces
to form metal–support interfaces that are highly active for
some types of hydrogenation reactions.32,33 However, the
requirement of reducible supports limits the use of readily available
nonreducible Al2O3 or SiO2 supports
in this system. To apply alumina or silica in SMSI catalysts, one
methodology is to prepare alumina- or silica-supported bimetallic
nanoparticles (NPs) where those bimetallic NPs are further transformed
into metal–metal oxide heteroaggregate nanostructures on supports.34−36

Here, we report the synthesis of alumina-supported Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 heteroaggregate
nanocatalysts
by in situ transformation of Rh@Co NPs. Rh has demonstrated excellent
chemical and electrochemical stability37,38 and has been
widely used in many catalytic and electrocatalytic reactions.39−41 However, Rh is rarely used in the catalytic hydrogenation of substituted
nitroaromatics due to its lower efficiency than those Pd or Pt catalysts.
In this study, to enhance its activity for nitroaromatic hydrogenations,
we prepared Rh-Co2O3 heteroaggregate nanostructures
by transformation of Rh@Co NPs. The 3–5 nm Rh@Co NPs were prepared
by a sequential reduction method, which was further in situ transformed
into Rh-Co2O3 heteroaggregate nanostructures
by calcination and following selective H2 reduction. Scheme 1 illustrates the
synthetic procedures of Rh-Co2O3 heteroaggregate
nanostructures. Hydrogenations of various substituted nitroaromatics
were chosen to investigate the correlation between catalytic performance
and catalyst structures. Compared with individual Rh/Al2O3 nanocatalysts, the Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 catalysts demonstrate enhanced catalytic activities
as well as selectivity for hydrogenations of a series of substituted
nitroaromatics. Characterization and catalytic results suggest that
the synergistic effect between Co2O3 and Rh
not only stabilizes the active Rh particles but also promotes the
hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization of Various
Materials
Rh@Co core–shell-like NPs were synthesized
by a seed-mediated growth method. PVP-stabilized Rh NPs were synthesized
by reduction of Rh2(COOCF3)4 using
EG as a reduction agent and a solvent, which was further used as a
seed to deposit Co onto Rh surfaces by reduction of Co(acac)2 using NaBH4 as the reduction agent. The Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 nanocatalysts were obtained
by in situ transformation of Rh@Co/Al2O3 through
calcination at 500 °C followed by H2 reduction at
250 °C.

Figure 1 presents XRD patterns of Rh NPs, Rh@Co NPs, and Rh-Co2O3 NPs. The Rh-Co2O3 NPs
are obtained by calcination of Rh@Co NPs at 550 °C and following
H2 reduction at 250 °C. As shown in Figure 1a, the Rh NPs show well-defined
fcc structures with characteristic diffractions at 41.0, 47.6, and
69.6°. While the Rh (111) diffractions in Rh@Co NPs are clearly
observed in Figure 1b, the Co diffractions are not observed, which possibly suggests
a core–shell-like structure with pure Rh cores and amorphous
Co shells. After calcination of Rh@Co NPs and following H2 reduction, the Rh diffractions in Rh-Co2O3 NPs appear without Co2O3 diffractions, indicating
heteroaggragate nanostructures consisting of Rh and amorphous Co2O3 phases. A similar phenomenon has been reported
in the literature.42 The absence of Co
diffractions in Rh@Co NPs and Co2O3 diffractions
in Rh-Co2O3 is due to the small sizes of Co
and Co2O3 phases with less crystallization,
and the enrichment of the Co element in outer layers will be confirmed
by HAADF-STEM with phase mappings and XPS studies.

Figure 1 XRD patterns: (a) Rh
NPs; (b) Rh@Co NPs; (c) Rh-Co2O3 NPs.

The TEM studies of Rh NPs, Rh@Co NPs, Rh/Al2O3, and Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 are
shown in Figure 2a–d,
respectively, and their corresponding particle size histograms are
presented in Figure 3a–d, respectively. As shown in Figures 2a and 3a, the Rh NPs
are relatively spherical with an average particle size of ∼4.0
nm. The inset of Figure 2a shows a lattice spacing of 0.228 nm, which is consistent with 0.227
nm of Rh (111) planes. The Rh@Co NPs in Figure 2b are spherical with an average particle
size of ∼4.2 nm. The inset in Figure 2b presents the Rh (111) lattice of 0.229
nm for Rh@Co NPs, suggesting phase-pure Rh cores. The TEM images/particle
size analyses of Rh/Al2O3 and Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 are illustrated in Figures 2c/3c and 2d/3d,
respectively. After calcination and following reduction, the Rh particle
size of Rh/Al2O3 increases from ∼4.0
nm (Figure 3a) to∼5.2
nm (Figure 3c), suggesting
a size increase after thermal treatment. In contrast, the average
particle size changes from ∼4.2 nm in Figure 3b to ∼4.3 nm in Figure 3d. Due to the small contrast between Co2O3 and Al2O3, the size analysis
in Figure 3d is ascribed
to the Rh size in Rh-Co2O3 nanostructures. The
nearly same particle size before and after high-temperature treatment
suggests that the Rh-Co2O3 interaction can prevent
the Rh NPs from agglomeration.

Figure 2 TEM images: (a) Rh NPs; (b) Rh@Co NPs;
(c) Rh/Al2O3; (d) Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3. Scale bars in panels (a–d) are
10 nm, and those in the insets
are 2 nm.

Rh/Al2O3; (d) Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3.

To further confirm the core–shell structure
of Rh@Co NPs,
HAADF-STEM studies with elemental phase mappings were performed. Figure 4a–d shows
the HAADF-STEM images of Rh@Co NPs and their corresponding Rh mapping,
Co mapping, and the combined Rh/Co mapping, respectively. It is apparent
that the Co mapping (Figure 4c) is bigger than the Rh mapping (Figure 4b), indicating the presence of Co in the
shells. Moreover, the combined Rh and Co mapping in Figure 4d clearly demonstrates a core–shell
structure of Rh@Co NPs with Rh cores and Co shells and is consistent
with the sequential reduction method using Rh seeds. The EDS linescan
of Rh@Co NPs is shown in Figure S1 and
is consistent with the phase mapping, further confirming the formation
of core–shell structures.

Figure 4 (a) HAADF-STEM image of Rh@Co NPs (the
red rectangle showing the
selected areas for phase mappings); (b) Rh phase mapping; (c) Co phase
mapping; (d) the combined Rh and Co phase mapping.

The XPS spectra of Rh@Co and Rh-Co2O3 are
shown in Figure 5a,b,
respectively, where Rh-Co2O3 is prepared by
calcination and following reduction of as-synthesized Rh@Co NPs. The
aforementioned samples were unsupported in order to obtain a better
XPS signal/noise ratio. The method of Doniach and Sunjic was used
for XPS curve fitting. The binding energy assignment is in accordance
with those in the literature.43−45 As shown in Figure 5a, the binding energies at
307.1/311.8 and 308.1/312.8 eV in Figure 5a can be ascribed to 3d5/2/3d3/2 of metallic Rh and oxidized Rh3+ species, respectively,
while the binding energies at 778.1/793.1 and 780.3/795.8 eV could
be assigned to 2p3/2/2p1/2 of Co0 and Co3+ species, respectively.46−48 In addition,
a broad satellite peak at 783.6/802.0 eV is assigned to 2p3/2/2p1/2 of Co2O3, suggesting that
the Co ions are primarily in a high-spin electronic state.47,49,50

Figure 5 XPS spectra: (a) as-synthesized Rh@Co
NPs; (b) Rh-Co2O3 NPs.

As for the XPS spectra of Rh-Co2O3 NPs in Figure 5b, the binding energies
at 307.1/311.9 and 309.0/313.7 eV can be assigned to 3d5/2/3d3/2 of Rh0 and oxidized Rh3+ species,
respectively. The Co binding energies at 781.2/796.7 and 784.7/802.4
eV are ascribed to 2p3/2/2p1/2 of Co3+ and Co3+ satellite peaks, respectively. The only presence
of Co3+ species is observed in Figure 5b, suggesting that calcination at 550 °C
results in the complete oxidation of Co species and the following
250 °C H2 reduction cannot reduce the Co3+ species.

Table 1 summarizes
the atomic ratios for different species. For Rh@Co NPs, 29.3% of Rh3+ species is observed due to the air exposure, while 77.1%
of Co atoms are in the oxidation state due to air exposure. It is
well known that Co is an active metal and the metallic Co NPs will
be oxidized to form cobalt oxide NPs due to air exposures. Therefore,
it is reasonable that the oxidized cobalt accounts for the largest
percentage in XPS studies. Similarly, 30.6% of Rh3+ species
is present in Rh-Co2O3 due to the surface oxidation
when NPs are exposed to air. The total Co/Rh ratios of Rh@Co and Rh-Co2O3 NPs by XPS analysis are 2.3/1.0 and 2.5/1.0,
respectively, while those by EDS analysis are 1.1/1.0 (1/1 ratio of
the starting materials). Since XPS is a surface-sensitive technique
and EDS is a bulk technique, the significantly higher Co/Rh ratios
for Rh@Co and Rh-Co2O3 suggest core–shell-like
structures of Rh@Co and Rh-Co2O3 NPs with nearly
pure Rh cores and Co-rich shells.

Table 1 Atomic Ratios of Co/Rh by XPS and
EDS Analysis
samples	Co0/Co3+	Rh0/Rh3+	Co/Rh (XPS)	Co/Rh (EDS)	
Rh@Co	22.9/77.1	70.8/29.3	2.3/1.0	1.1/1.0	
Rh-Co2O3	0.0/100.0	69.4/30.6	2.5/1.0	1.1/1.0	
Figure 6a shows
the TPO study of Rh@Co/Al2O3. The O2 consumption peaks appear below 500 °C, confirming the complete
oxidation of Co and Rh in Rh@Co NPs by 500 °C calcination.51−53 H2-TPR profiles of Rh2O3-Co2O3/Al2O3 are presented in Figure 6b. A consumption
peak at ∼77 °C is due to the reduction of Rh2O3.52,54,55 Moreover, H2 consumption peaks at ∼282, ∼422,
and ∼658 °C are the reduction peaks of Co2O3, Co3O4, and CoO, respectively.56,57 It is concluded that only Rh will be reduced to form Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 in the reduction of Rh2O3-Co2O3/Al2O3 at 250 °C with H2, which is consistent with
the XPS study of Rh-Co2O3 where only Co3+ species were observed for Rh-Co2O3 NPs.

Figure 6 (a) O2-TPO profiles showing Rh@Co/Al2O3 materials; (b) H2-TPR profiles showing Rh2O3-Co2O3/Al2O3 nanocatalysts.

Figure 7 shows DRIFT-IR
spectra with CO probes of Rh/Al2O3, Rh@Co/Al2O3, and Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3. As shown in Figure 7a (Rh/Al2O3), two characteristic
bands at 1906 and 2018 cm–1 are clearly observed:
the former is ascribed to bridge CO on Rh sites, and the latter can
be attributed to linear CO on Rh sites.58Figure 7b shows the
DRIFT-IR spectrum of Rh@Co/Al2O3. The 1885 cm–1 peak for bridge CO on Rh sites and 2019 cm–1 peak for linear CO on Rh sites are clearly observed, while the bands
at 1652 and 2177 cm–1 are the characteristic bands
of bridged and linear CO on Co sites, respectively.59−63 The copresence of CO bands on Co and Rh sites in Figure 7b indicates that
the shells are Co-rich (not pure Co). Accordingly, as shown in Figure 7c, after calcination
and subsequent reduction of Rh@Co/Al2O3, the
Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 shows the
bands at 1640 and 2183 cm–1, which can be attributed
to CO on Co sites, while the bands at 1885, 2019, and 2066 cm–1 are ascribed to CO on Rh sites.58 Again, the copresence of Co and Rh in Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 by the DRIFT-IR study indicates
Rh-Co2O3 heteroaggregate nanostructures with
some naked Rh surfaces.

2.2 Catalytic Performances of Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 and Rh/Al2O3 Nanocatalysts
Catalytic hydrogenations of various
substituted nitroaromatics over Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 were carried out with vigorous magnetic stirring
under the reaction conditions of 45 °C and atmospheric H2 pressure. The theoretical Rh loadings Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 and Rh/Al2O3 are both 0.5 wt %, and the real Rh loadings of Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 and Rh/Al2O3 are 0.40 and 0.47 wt %, respectively.

The hydrogenation
of m-chloronitrobenzene (m-CNB)
over Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 nanocatalysts
with Rh/Co ratios of 2/1, 1/1, and 1/2 is shown in Table S1, and we denote the abovementioned catalysts as 2/1-Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3, Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3, and 1/2-Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3, respectively. The major
product in catalytic hydrogenation of m-CNB is m-chloroaniline (m-CAN),64−66 and the main
by-products are the intermediates during the hydrogenation process
as well as the aniline from the hydrodechlorination reactions.67−69As shown in Table S1, compared with 2/1-Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 and 1/2-Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3, the Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 catalysts illustrate a
significantly enhanced performance with an m-CNB
conversion of 99.6% and m-CAN selectivity of 97.0%.
The comparison suggests that a ratio of Rh/Co of 1/1 is desired, and
higher or lower ratios of Rh/Co result in poor catalytic performance
due to a weaker Rh-Co2O3 interaction or less
exposed Rh surfaces, respectively. Therefore, Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 catalysts were selected for hydrogenations
of a series of substituted nitroaromatics. Moreover, as shown in Table S2, individual Co2O3/Al2O3 shows no activity, and the physical
mixtures of Rh/Al2O3 and Co2O3/Al2O3 show a similar activity to that
of individual Rh/Al2O3, indicating that any
catalytic enhancement of Rh-Co2O3 should originate
from the close-contact Rh-Co2O3 heteroaggregate
nanostructures.

Table 2 presents
the catalytic performance of Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. For o- and m-CNB hydrogenations, the Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 illustrates significantly enhanced activities
and selectivity relative to Rh/Al2O3. For example,
the Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 shows
a 99.0% o-CNB conversion with 99.8% of o-CAN selectivity even at a relatively low Rh loading, while the control
Rh/Al2O3 presents 20.7% of conversion with 76.3%
of selectivity. For hydrogenations of o- and p-NP, Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 also demonstrates enhanced activities and selectivity relative
to control Rh/Al2O3, confirming the beneficial
effect of Co2O3 on the catalytic performance
due to the Rh-Co2O3 interaction. This interaction
could induce a blockage effect18 where
the decoration of metal oxide onto active metals will selectively
facilitate the coordination of the desired functional groups, resulting
in enhanced selectivity.

%); Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 (real
Rh loading, 0.40 wt %).

b TOF is measured as moles of reacted
molecules per molar total Rh atoms per hour at a reaction time of
4 h.

The effects of reaction time on o-NP conversion
and o-AP selectivity over Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 nanocatalysts are shown in Figure S2. With increasing reaction time, the
conversion of o-NP increases from 8.0% at 0.5 h to
100.0% at 4.0 h, while o-AP selectivity remains at
nearly 100% during the hydrogenation process, suggesting a fast process
from the intermediates to the final product o-aminophenol.
The effects of temperatures and catalyst weights on catalytic hydrogenation
of o-NP over Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 nanocatalysts are presented in Figure 8 where the reaction time is
fixed at 2.0 h. As shown in Figure 8, the conversion obviously increases with increasing
temperature or catalyst weight, while the selectivity only shows a
slight dependence on temperatures or catalyst weights, further confirming
the fast transformation of intermediates to the final products.

2.3 Catalytic Stability of Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 Nanocatalysts
Recycling
experiments of o-NP catalytic hydrogenations were
performed to investigate the catalytic stability of Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3. During the process, no
fresh catalysts were added into the systems, and less solvents and
substrates are charged in the following cycles to fix the ratios of
solvent/catalyst and substrate/catalyst. As shown in Table 3, from cycles 1 to 5, the o-NP conversion and selectivity over Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 are highly stable with 100% of o-NP conversion and above 98.7% of o-AP
selectivity, strongly suggesting a good structural stability of Rh-Co2O3 heteroaggregate nanostructures.

3 Conclusions
In summary, Rh@Co core–shell-like
NPs were successfully
prepared by a sequential reduction method, and Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 heteroaggregate nanocatalysts
were synthesized by in situ transformation of Rh@Co NPs on Al2O3 supports. Various characterizations confirm
that the Rh@Co NPs consist of pure Rh cores and Co-rich shells, and
Rh-Co2O3 NPs are close-contact heteroaggregate
nanostructures. The Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 nanocatalysts show enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity
for the hydrogenations of o-CNB, m-CNB, o-NP, m-NP, and p-NP relative to the control Rh/Al2O3 nanocatalysts,
and the catalytic performance enhancement of Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 is ascribed to the strong Rh-Co2O3 interaction.

at 500 °C for 3 h were purchased from Qingdao Haiyang Chemical
Co., Ltd. All of the reagents were used as received without further
purification.

4.2 Catalyst Preparation
4.2.1 Synthesis of Rh NPs
Rh NPs were
synthesized by a reported method.70 In
a typical synthesis, 0.050 mmol of Rh2(COOCF3)4, 277.5 mg of PVP-K30, 1.0 mmol of NaCOOCF3, and 10.0 mL of EG were transferred into a 50 mL three-necked round-bottom
flask. The system was heated to 115 °C with vigorous magnetic
stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere. The color of the solution gradually
changed from light blue to black, indicating the reduction of Rh precursors.
After maintaining at 115 °C for 15 min, the system was further
heated to and maintained at 155 °C for 75 min. The mixture was
cooled to room temperature followed by centrifugation with acetone
and ethyl alcohol three times to collect black solids for further
characterization.

4.2.2 Synthesis of Rh@Co Core–Shell NPs
Rh@Co NPs were synthesized by a sequential reduction method. Rh
NP solids (0.05 mmol Rh) dispersed in 10.0 mL of TREG and 277.5 mg
of PVP-K30 were charged into a 50 mL three-necked round-bottom flask
with vigorous magnetic stirring under a N2 atmosphere.
The mixture was further heated to 175 °C, and then 0.05 mmol
of Co(acac)2 in 1.0 mL of absolute methanol was injected
into the system using a syringe followed by addition of 1.0 mmol of
solid NaBH4. The mixture was maintained at 175 °C
for 2 h to complete the reduction of Co precursors. The mixture was
further cooled to room temperature followed by centrifugation with
acetone and ethyl alcohol three times to collect black solids for
further characterization.

4.2.3 Synthesis of Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 and Rh/Al2O3 Nanocatalysts
The collected Rh@Co solids were redispersed in absolute ethanol
in a 100 mL three-necked round-bottom flask, and a calculated amount
of alumina (a Rh theoretical loading of 0.5 wt %) was added to the
abovementioned colloid. The resultant mixture was further heated to
60 °C and purged with N2 to remove ethanol to obtain
the gray Rh@Co2O3/Al2O3 materials, which was then calcined at 500 °C in air for 3 h
and subsequently reduced in H2 at 250 °C for 3 h with
a 50 v/v H2/N2 gas to give Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 nanocatalysts.

The
synthesis of Rh/Al2O3 nanocatalysts with a Rh
theoretical loading of 0.5 wt % was the same as that of Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 nanocatalysts except
that the redispersed Rh ethanol colloids are used. The real metal
loadings of Rh/Al2O3 and Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 were determined by ICP-OES.

4.3 Catalyst Characterizations
X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of Rh, Rh@Co, and Rh-Co2O3 NPs were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 20 to 90°.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images with energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) were obtained by using a JEOL 2100 transmission
electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The high-angle annular dark-field
scanning transition electron microscopy images (HAADF-STEM) with phase
mappings were obtained using a Talos F200x, which is operated at 200
kV with 0.16 nm resolution for STEM images. X-ray photoelectron spectra
(XPS) were obtained on an AXIS ULTRA DLD multifunctional X-ray photoelectron
spectroscope with an Al source. The instrument was calibrated by C
1s (284.8 eV), and the XPS data were processed using a Casa XPS software.
The studies of O2 temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)
of Rh@Co/Al2O3 and H2 temperature-programmed
reduction (H2-TPR) of Rh2O3-Co2O3/Al2O3 were performed on
an Auto ChemII 2920 instrument. The diffuse reflectance Fourier transform
infrared spectra (DRIFT-IR) with CO probes were obtained using a Nicolet-6700
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer with a resolution of 4 cm–1 and the number of scans of 32. At first, the materials
were pretreated with H2 at 100 °C for 20 min at a
gas flow rate of 20 mL/min followed by cooling down to 30 °C.
After the samples were purged with Ar at 30 °C for 20 min, the
DRIFT-IR background spectrum was recorded. The samples were further
treated with CO (99.99%) at a gas flow rate of 20 mL min–1 at 30 °C for 20 min and subsequently purged with Ar to remove
the free CO before the DRIFT-IR spectra were recorded. The product
analyses of catalytic hydrogenations of substituted nitroaromatics
over Rh-Co2O3/Al2O3 and
Rh/Al2O3 were performed by a GC 2060 gas chromatograph
equipped with a flame ionization detector.

4.4 Catalyst Activity Measurements
The
atmospheric H2 pressure and a vigorous magnetic stirring
at 500 rpm are employed for hydrogenations of various substituted
nitroaromatics with H2. Various substituted nitroaromatics
(1.0000 g), supported catalysts (0.1000 g), and absolute ethanol (25
mL) were charged into a 100 mL three-necked round-bottom flask. The
system was heated to and kept at a desired temperature under 0.1 MPa
H2 for the defined reaction time. After the reaction was
done, the solid catalysts were collected by centrifugation, and the
liquid products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph. For recycling
experiments, after each cycle, the solid catalysts were collected
by centrifugation, washed with ethyl alcohol several times, and further
dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. In the next cycle experiment,
the amounts of substituted nitroaromatics and solvents were decreased
according to the weights of recovered catalysts to keep the ratios
of reactant/catalyst and reactant/solvent constant.
