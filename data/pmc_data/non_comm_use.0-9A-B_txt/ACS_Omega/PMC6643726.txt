It
is of considerable interest to prepare weakly ligated, labile
ligand (WLLL) nanoparticles for applications in areas such as chemical
catalysis. WLLL nanoparticles can be defined as nanoparticles with
sufficient, albeit minimal, surface ligands of moderate binding strength
to meta-stabilize nanoparticles, initial stabilizer ligands that can
be readily replaced by other, desired, more strongly coordinating
ligands and removed completely when desired. Herein, we describe WLLL
nanoparticles prepared from [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 reduction
under H2, in acetone. The results suggest that H+Cl–-stabilized Ir(0)n nanoparticles, herein Ir(0)n·(H+Cl–)a, serve
as a WLLL nanoparticle for the preparation of, as illustrative examples,
five specific nanoparticle products: Ir(0)n·(Cl–Bu3NH+)a, Ir(0)n·(Cl–Dodec3NH+)a, Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n(Cl–H+)b, Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n, and the
γ-Al2O3-supported heterogeneous catalyst,
Ir(0)n·(γ-Al2O3)a(Cl–H+)b. (where a and b vary for the differently ligated nanoparticles; in addition,
solvent can be present as a nanoparticle surface ligand). With added
POct3 as a key, prototype example, an important feature
is that a minimum, desired, experimentally determinable amount of
ligand (e.g., just 0.2 equiv POct3 per mole of Ir) can
be added, which is shown to provide sufficient stabilization that
the resultant Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n(Cl–H+)b is isolable. Additionally, the initial
labile ligand stabilizer HCl can be removed to yield Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n that is >99% free of Cl– by a AgCl precipitation
test. The results provide strong support for the weakly ligated, labile
ligand nanoparticle concept and specific support for Ir(0)n·(H+Cl–)a as a WLLL nanoparticle.

Introduction
Transition-metal nanoparticles
are of significant interest within
the catalysis community.1−5 Because bulk metal is thermodynamically favored compared to metal(0)
nanoparticles, stabilizing ligands are needed to prevent agglomeration
of the resultant nanoparticles in solution.6 Unfortunately, many (albeit not all7)
common stabilizers bind strong enough to nanoparticle catalyst surfaces
to act as catalyst poisons.8,9 This includes many of
the ligands that have led to what are otherwise valuable advances
in the synthesis of size- and shape-controlled transition-metal nanoparticles.10−15

There have been many attempts to remove nanoparticle surface
ligands,
including extensive treatments such as thermal activation in N2, H2, and O2 environments,16−20 UV/ozone,21−25 O2/plasma,24 and neutron sputtering.26 Complete (100%) removal of nanoparticle-stabilizing
ligands and polymers without inducing nanoparticle agglomeration or
oxidizing the nanoparticle surface has proven largely unsuccessful,
not unexpectedly.17−21,23,24 A related problem of current interest is establishing and controlling
a precise nanoparticle surface composition,27 ill-defined and uncontrolled nanoparticle composition in turn affecting
key catalytic properties such as catalytic selectivity, activity,
lifetime, recovery, and recyclability.28

There have also been a number of reports attempting to prepare
putatively “naked” nanoparticles that, in at least the
literal interpretation of naked, would be devoid of any ligands, even
solvent.8,29−34 Although there have been claims of naked nanoparticles in the literature,35−37 nanoparticle surfaces will of course never be truly naked in solution
because even solvent-to-metal bond energies are 10 ± 3 kcal/mol
for even the extreme case of metal–alkane bonds, at least in
small-molecule organometallic complexes.38−41 Solvent-only stabilized nanoparticles
have been claimed in the literature,42−46 but often anionic ligands (such as Cl–, OAc–, or other anions present in the synthetic
precursor) are present but have not been tested, nor hence ruled out,
as actual sources of nanoparticle stabilization. For example, in a
recent report,35 Pt(0) nanoparticles generated
in acetic acid are claimed to be naked, but the high probability of
surface OAc– as a stabilizing ligand was not tested
nor ruled out. We discuss putatively naked nanoparticles more in the Supporting Information (SI) for the interested reader.

Hence, an
unrealized goal is to prepare nanoparticles that have
only relatively weakly bound, kinetically labile ligands, which provide
a near-minimum level of nanoparticle meta-stabilization, which we
have termed “weakly ligated, labile ligand” (WLLL) nanoparticles.6,38,47 Such nanoparticles could, then
and in principle, serve as a key synthetic structural unit/building
block—that is, as a (nanoparticle) synthon—for use in
the preparation of differently ligated nanoparticles and other nanoparticle
products, the word synthon having been coined by Corey in 1967.48 Such nanoparticles would then have a relatively
precise, well-defined set of (at least average) ligands, plus any
bound solvent, for applications in catalysts and other areas. It would
be valuable synthetically to be able to add pretty much any desired
ligand to a nanoparticle synthon, especially if sub-stoichiometric
amounts (ligand/metal ≪ 1) could be used thereby leaving surface
sites available—that is, providing coordinative unsaturation—for
catalysis or other applications and also opening up the use of the
ligand/metal ratio for nanoparticle size and catalytic activity control.49−52

Worth noting here is that minimally stabilized, meta-stable,
substitutionally
labile metal complexes that are (or behave as if they are) coordinatively
unsaturated are an important concept in classical organometallic chemistry.
Notable here are complexes such as Wilke’s classic “naked
nickel”, Ni0(1,5-COD)2,53 M(1,5-COD)2n+ or
(M(1,5-COD)Clx)y (M = Ir, Rh, Pt, Ru),54,55 M(NCCH3)xn+(BF4)n complexes (M = MnII, FeII, CoII, CuII, CuI, ZnII),56 as well as other examples
one can find in the literature.57,58 Indeed, Ir(1,5-COD)Cl2 is a key starting material in the present contribution. It
follows that development of lightly stabilized, meta-stable, effectively
coordinatively unsaturated, WLLL nanoparticles can be expected to
have an analogous, sizable, positive impact on nanoparticle science.

We previously reported that Ir(0) nanoparticles obtained from H2 reduction of [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 in acetone are formed
according to the balanced reaction in Scheme 1.59 By design,
this simple, clean reaction produces Ir(0) nanoparticles59,60 that have only two possibilities for surface ligands, H+Cl– and acetone solvent, that is, Ir(0)n·(Cl–H+)a(acetone)b—and
as such, they are a prototype example of WLLL nanoparticles. The formation
of discrete 1.8 ± 0.5 nm Ir(0)n nanoparticles
is evident from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of
a sample harvested at an early stage of the acetone hydrogenation
reaction, as shown in Figure 1 of the original paper.59

Scheme 1 Nanoparticle Formation Stoichiometry and Acetone Hydrogenation
Activity
of Ir(0)n·(Cl–H+)a(acetone)b WLLL Nanoparticles Starting
from [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 in Neat Acetone at 22 °C under
an Initial 3.7 atm of H259
Pleasingly, the Ir(0)n·(Cl–H+)a(acetone)b nanoparticles
proved to be an exceptionally
active and selective acetone hydrogenation catalyst (1.9 turnovers/s
at 22 °C to 95% 2-propanol; 16 400 total catalytic turnovers).59 The acid-assisted catalytic hydrogenation of
acetone was corroborated by the inhibition of catalysis (no catalytic
turnover) if H+ is scavenged from solution by using Proton
Sponge (1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene) as a strong, noncoordinating
base62 and by the unusual kinetics of the
reaction that were, however, explicable in terms of the HCl requirement
for acetone hydrogenation.59

The
above results, while encouraging and quite supportive of the
WLLL nanoparticle concept, left a number of additional, remaining
possible uses of the WLLL Ir(0)n nanoparticles
to be examined (Scheme 2). We note that others have already contributed to this scheme, notably
the ionic liquid studies from Dupont’s labs that will be referenced
and detailed in a later section.

Scheme 2 Formation and Possible Applications
of Ir(0)n·(Cl–H+)a(acetone)b as a Weakly Ligated,
Labile Ligand (WLLL) Precursor
The
Ir(0)n·(Cl–H+)a(acetone)b is shown as a true
synthon in the scheme to illustrate the concept; it should be noted,
however, that, in the present work, the Ir(0)n·(Cl–H+)a(acetone)b is not premade or
preisolated, but rather is formed in situ with the added ligands such
as R3N and POct3, or solid support, γ-Al2O3.

Herein, we report the
additional studies probing the WLLL nanoparticle
concept in the case of Ir(0)n·(Cl–H+)a(acetone)b of: (i) adding Bu3N to make Ir(0)n·(Cl–Bu3NH+)b nanoparticles; (ii) subsequently
removing H+Cl– to yield Ir(0)n·(NBu3)c nanoparticles; (iii) adding longer-chain Dodec3N to yield
Ir(0)n·(Cl–Dodec3NH+)b nanoparticles;
and importantly (iv) adding POct3 and removing H+Cl– to yield Ir(0)n·(POct3)d catalytically
active nanoparticles, where the ratio of POct3/Ir is small,
0.1–0.2. In addition, we report (v) adding γ-Al2O3 (and removing H+Cl–) to
yield Ir(0)n·γ-Al2O3 catalytically active nanoparticles. The results suggest
that Ir(0)n·H+Cl– can serve as a WLLL en route to composition- and surface ligand-controlled
nanoparticles for catalysis and other applications.

Results and Discussion
Bu3NH+Cl–-Stabilized
Nanoparticles from [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 Plus Bu3N
Starting with [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2, Bu3NH+Cl–-stabilized Ir(0)n·(Cl–Bu3NH+)a nanoparticles were synthesized
in acetone under H2 and now in the presence of 1 equiv
Bu3N (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Stoichiometry of Formation of Bu3NH+Cl–-Stabilized Ir(0)n Nanoparticles
The stoichiometry of the reaction
was confirmed via cyclooctane
evolution, where 1.0 ± 0.1 equiv per mole of Ir were evolved.
The reaction was monitored indirectly by having 1375 equiv of cyclohexene
(vs Ir) present, that is, by our well-precedented method of a cyclohexene
hydrogenation reporter reaction that reports the formation of catalytically
active Ir(0)n nanoparticles (Figure 1).59 Note that the evolution of 1.0 ± 0.1 equiv cyclooctane
per Ir and no detectible amount of cyclohexene after hydrogenation
(as determined by gas chromatography (GC) and NMR) indicate the complete
conversion of cyclohexene to cyclohexane. Hence, no cyclohexene remains
so that cyclohexene needs not be considered as a possible nanoparticle
surface ligand. The resultant Ir(0)n·Bu4NH+Cl– nanoparticles shown in Figure 2 have an average
size of 1.8 ± 0.6 nm.

Figure 1 (a) Hydrogen uptake vs time plot for the hydrogenation
of cyclohexene
plus acetone and concomitant formation of iridium(0) nanoparticles
starting with [(1,5-COD)IrCl]2 (1.2 mM Ir) and cyclohexene
(1.65 M) in acetone at 22.0 ± 0.1 °C. Both cyclohexene and
acetone undergo hydrogenation; the former is faster than the latter.59 (b) Loss of cyclohexene versus time curve in

mM Ir) and 1.2 mM Bu3N in acetone at 22.0 ± 0.1 °C.
A linear hydrogenation of cyclohexene starts with an initial turnover
frequency (TOF) of 1.1 s–1. The pressure rise in
the initial part of both curves (not shown), due to the solvent vapor
pressure reequilibration after 15 flushes of the reaction flask with
H2, has been corrected (and thereby removed from this curve
as) by the precedented procedure described elsewhere.61

Figure 2 TEM image of Ir(0)n nanoparticles sample
harvested after complete cyclohexene hydrogenation starting with [(1,5-COD)IrCl]2 (1.2 mM Ir) and 1.2 mM Bu3N in acetone at 22.0
± 0.1 °C. The average particle size is 1.8 ± 0.6 nm.

A control reaction, to test if
the hydrogenation is influenced
by mass-transfer limitations63 even though
the reaction is well stirred, was done in which the same [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 and Bu3N precursors were used, but each was concentration-doubled.
The results, given in Figure S1 of the
Supporting Information, show that the cyclohexene hydrogenation rate
is doubled in comparison to that given in Figure 1b, demonstrating that the reaction is not
under H2 gas-to-solution mass-transfer limitations.63

The Bu3NH+Cl–-stabilized
Ir(0)n nanoparticles are active cyclohexene
hydrogenation catalysts, providing an initial TOF of 1.1 s–1 at 22.0 ± 0.1 °C (Figure 1b). The nanoparticles can also be redispersed in acetone
solution, retaining a TOF value of 0.2 s–1 at 22.0
± 0.1 °C (Figure S2 in the SI)
and yielding 25 000 total turnovers (TTOs) for cyclohexene
reduction before deactivating via agglomeration (Figure S3 in the SI and in comparison to Figure S2). In short, compositionally relatively simple and
relatively well-defined, catalytically active Bu3NH+Cl–-stabilized Ir(0)n·(Cl–Bu3NH+)a nanoparticles have been prepared from the in
situ generated Ir(0)n·H+Cl– in the presence of Bu3N, as shown
back in Scheme 2.

Demonstration of H+Cl– Removal
from Ir(0)n·(Cl–Bu3NH+)a
To demonstrate the extent to which the weak, initially present labile
ligand H+Cl– could be removed from the
Ir(0)n·(Cl–Bu3NH+)a nanoparticles,
the solid particles were heated from 100 to 300 °C under He in
a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiment. The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) data in Figure 3 show a weight loss of 8.6% between 25 and 120 °C, indicating
that ≥98% of the HCl can be removed under the relatively mild
TGA, ≤120 °C conditions. (It is likely that the other,
≤2% of HCl, was removed when the solvent and cyclohexane (resulting
from the hydrogenation of cyclohexene) were removed under vacuum from
the sample at room temperature, prior to the TGA analysis.) The 16.6%
weight loss between 120 and 200 °C is attributed to partial removal
of the resultant Bu3N ligand (theoretical for the full
loss of Bu3N = 44.8%). Interestingly, the resultant Bu3N-stabilized nanoparticles are partially, albeit not completely,
stabilized against agglomeration when resuspended in acetone solution
(see Figure S2 in the SI for details).

Figure 3 TGA of
the Bu3NH+Cl–-stabilized
Ir(0)n nanoparticles formed during the
reduction of 3.6 mM [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 in the presence of
7.2 mM Bu3N in acetone at 22 °C and under an initial
pressure of 4.7 atm H2 along with concomitant hydrogenation
of an initial 1.65 M cyclohexene. The observed 8.6 wt % loss from
25 to 120 °C is attributable to the removal of ≥98% of
the HCl present (i.e., 8.6% weight loss vs a theoretical 8.8% loss).

Of note here is that these results
are interesting when considered
in light of classic heterogeneous catalysis literature, where removal
of Cl– from the active metal surface is important
because Cl– is well known to affect catalytic rates,
for example benzene hydrogenation over Ir/TiO2 catalysts.66 Additionally, Cl– removal
is crucial when trying to deconvolute trace Cl– effects
from the effects of changing facet ratios that accompany decreasing
nanoparticle size.65 In general, and despite
extensive efforts to remove Cl– quantitatively from
supported catalysts, complete Cl– removal from MClx·(H2O)n plus H2 (and which in principle generates M(0)·HCl,
not unlike the present syntheses) is a difficult task,66,64,67 with, for example, demonstration
of observable catalytic activity suppression at a Cl–/Au molar ratio as low as 0.0006.67 A
compounding problem is that the waters of solvation can change the
putative “MClx·(H2O)n” to a more complex speciation
that involves MClx–2yOy(H2O)n–y·2y(HCl),
not all of which are as readily or cleanly reducible to M(0) as is,
for example, the [(1,5-COD)IrCl]2 precatalyst employed
herein. However, by starting herein with the well-defined, already
partially reduced (to Ir(I)) precursor [(1,5-COD)IrCl]2 (which, for example, lacks undesired waters of solvation), the reduction
under H2 proceeds cleanly and quantitatively to Ir(0)·H+Cl– according to the stoichiometry shown
back in Scheme 1. The
resultant, volatile HCl is then readily removable under relatively
mild, ≤120 °C conditions (Scheme 4).

Extension to Longer-Chain Amine-Stabilized Nanoparticles: Dodec3NH+Cl–-Stabilized Nanoparticles
Ir(0)n·(Cl–Dodec3NH+)a from H2 Reduction of [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 in the Presence of Dodec3N
To demonstrate the ready extension of the WLLL
nanoparticle route to longer-chain amines that can, therefore, serve
as enhanced stabilizers or render different nanoparticle solubility,6 [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 was reduced under
H2 in acetone solution at 22.0 ± 0.1 °C in the
presence of tris(dodecyl)amine as an additional nanoparticle stabilizer
as well as in the presence of 1.65 M cyclohexene (that, again, is
completely hydrogenated as demonstrated by GC and NMR and, therefore,
not available as an olefinic ligand stabilizer; Figure 4).

Figure 4 Loss of cyclohexene vs time curve in the H2 reduction
of [(1,5-COD)IrCl]2 (1.2 mM Ir) in the presence of 1.2
mM Dodec3N in acetone at 22.0 ± 0.1 °C along
with concomitant complete hydrogenation of 1.65 M cyclohexene. The
pressure rise observed in the initial part of the curve, due to the
solvent vapor pressure reequilibration after 15 flushes of the reaction
flask with H2, has been corrected (and hence removed from
this curve) by the precedented procedure described elsewhere.61

Dodec3NH+Cl–-stabilized
Ir(0)n nanoparticles show cyclohexene
hydrogenation activity (initial TOF of ∼1.4 s–1) essentially the same as that of Bu3NH+Cl–-stabilized Ir(0)n nanoparticles
(initial TOF of 1.1 s–1) at 22.0 ± 0.1 °C
(Figure 4). The nanoparticles
can be redispersed in acetone solution, retaining a TOF value of 0.2
s–1 in the second run of cylohexene hydrogenation
at 22.0 ± 0.1 °C (Figure S4 in
the SI). The TEM image (Figure 5) shows that the Dodec3NH+Cl–-stabilized Ir(0)n nanoparticles have
an average particle size of 1.8 ± 0.6 nm, the same within experimental
error as the Bu3NH+Cl–-stabilized
Ir(0)n nanoparticles. These results demonstrate
that changing the alkyl chain length by eight carbons from butyl to
dodecyl has no significant influence on the particle size or catalytic
activity of the resultant R3NH+Cl–-stabilized Ir(0)n nanoparticles.

Ir(0)n nanoparticles harvested
after complete cyclohexene hydrogenation starting with [(1,5-COD)IrCl]2 (1.2 mM Ir) and 1.2 mM tris(dodecyl)amine, Dodec3N in acetone at 22.0 ± 0.1 °C. The average particle size
is 1.8 ± 0.6 nm.

POct3-Stabilized Ir(0)n Nanoparticles,
Ir(0)n·(POct3)a(Cl–H+)b, from [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 Plus POct3
Starting with [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 plus just
0.2 equiv POct3 per mole of iridium
in acetone, Ir(0)n·(POct3)a(Cl–H+)b nanoparticles were formed during the
cyclohexene/acetone hydrogenation under H2 at 22.0 ±
0.1 °C (Figure 6a). Trioctylphosphine was picked based on a suggestion from our collaborator
Prof. A. Karim and because it is a strongly binding ligand with a
perhaps surprisingly small Tolman cone angle of 107° (in comparison
to PR3 (R = Et, Pr, Bu) cone angles that are all 132°).68 Importantly, adding just 0.2 equiv POct3 per mole of Ir to the starting [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 precatalyst solution yields stable iridium(0) nanoparticles that
are still active hydrogenation catalysts. In short, the Ir(0)n·(Cl–H+)b WLLL concept leads to the ready preparation
of Ir(0)n·(POct3)a(Cl–H+)b nanoparticles with an approximately (low level)
minimum amount of added ligand, L = (POct3) in this case,
which yields a narrow, 1.5 ± 0.2 nm dispersion of catalytically
active Ir(0)n nanoparticles with no visibly
or TEM-discernable bulk metal.

hydrogenation of cyclohexene/acetone
and concomitant formation of Ir(0)n nanoparticles
starting with [(1,5-COD)IrCl]2 (1.2 mM Ir) plus 0.2 equiv
POct3 and cyclohexene (1.65 M) in acetone at 22.0 ±
0.1 °C. The pressure rise observed in the initial part of curve,
due to the solvent vapor pressure reequilibration after 15 flushes
of the reaction flask with H2, has been corrected (and
hence removed from this curve) by the precedented procedure described
elsewhere.61 (b) Bright-field scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image and (c) the corresponding
particle size histogram of Ir(0)n·(POct3)a(Cl–H+)b nanoparticles in the sample
harvested after 22 h hydrogenation (1.0 ± 0.1 equiv cyclooctane
had evolved as determined by GC). The mean diameter of Ir(0) nanoparticles
is 1.5 ± 0.2 nm (i.e., ±15%).

Figure 6b
shows
TEM image of the sample harvested after the complete hydrogenation
of cyclohexene and acetone (22 h) exhibiting the formation of highly
dispersed Ir(0) nanoparticles. The GC determination of 1.0 ±
0.1 equiv of cyclooctane evolution per mole of Ir after 22 h indicates
the complete reduction of the (1,5-COD)Ir(I)-containing precursor
to Ir(0) when the nanoparticle sample harvested. The average particle
size is 1.5 ± 0.2 nm according to the histogram in Figure 6c. The comparison of the particle
size of Ir(0)n·(POct3)a(Cl–H+)b to that of Bu3NH+Cl–- or Dodec3NH+Cl–-stabilized nanoparticles (1.8 ± 0.6 nm) is consistent with
the effect of the stronger binding POct3 phosphine ligand
yielding an on average smaller, ≥3 fold-narrower size distribution
of Ir(0)n·(POct3)a(Cl–H+)b nanoparticles.

Noteworthy here is that
ligand-based control of nanoparticle sizes
and size distributions is an important current research topic.9,45,69−71 The Ir(0)n·(POct3)a(Cl–H+)b system developed herein is important in this regard because
well-formed and size-controlled Ir(0)∼150 nanoparticlesa,72,73 are formed from even
low, 0.2 equiv ligand-to-Ir ratios—implying, in turn, that
ligand-to-Ir ratios between 0.2 and ≥1.0 should be studiable
by in-progress small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and other efforts.

Isolable, HCl-free, Minimally Ligated Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n Nanoparticles
Significantly, trioctylphosphine-stabilized
Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n nanoparticles, with only 0.2 equiv of P(Oct)3 and testing ≥99% free of HCl, could be isolated as
a powder by removing HCl and the acetone solvent under vacuum. It
is noteworthy that these isolated Ir(0) nanoparticles are redispersible
in acetone and other organic solvents with good catalytic activity: Figure 7a shows the H2 uptake versus time plot cyclohexene plus acetone hydrogenation
using the isolated Ir(0)n nanoparticles
formed from a first run of cyclohexene/acetone hydrogenation. Compared
to the Ir(0)n·(POct3)a(Cl–H+)b nanoparticles (Figure 6c, where the mean particle size is 1.5 ±
0.2 nm, i.e., ±15%), the Ir(0)n·(POct3)a nanoparticles do exhibit a
somewhat broadened size distribution (Figure 7c, the mean particle size = 1.4 ± 0.4
nm, i.e., ±28%), not unexpectedly because of some agglomeration
during the isolation and redispersion processes.

Figure 7 (a) Hydrogen consumption
vs time plot for the hydrogenation of
cyclohexene (the fast part of the H2 pressure loss curve)
then acetone (the slower, subsequent part of the hydrogenation curve)
using the redispersed Ir(0)n·(POct)0.2n nanoparticles formed from a first run
of cyclohexene/acetone hydrogenation (i.e., formed starting with [(1,5-COD)IrCl]2 (1.2 mM Ir) plus 0.2 equiv POct3 and cyclohexene
(1.65 M) in acetone at 22.0 ± 0.1 °C). The Ir(0) nanoparticles
were isolated by removing the volatiles including HCl in vacuum and
then redispersed in acetone for this second hydrogenation. The pressure
rise observed in the initial part of the curve, due to the solvent
vapor pressure reequilibration after 15 flushes of the reaction flask
with H2, has been corrected (and hence removed from this
curve) by the precedented procedure described elsewhere.61 (b) Bright-field STEM image of the sample harvested
after 22 h hydrogenation and (c) the corresponding particle size histogram
of Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n nanoparticles. Mean diameter of Ir(0)
nanoparticles is 1.4 ± 0.4 nm (i.e., ±28%).

However and significantly, HCl has been largely
removed as demonstrated
by the very slow hydrogenation of acetone seen in Figure 7 (∼0.91 psig H2 loss/h), HCl being a known requirement for facile acetone hydrogenation
(i.e., by the same precatalyst and under essentially identical conditions59).

Independently, confirming evidence for
the removal of HCl at the
>99% level (i.e., from HCl-containing, Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n(Cl–H+)b nanoparticles) to give
the novel, essentially HCl-free Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n nanoparticles
is provided by treatment of the isolated product with a 1.2 mM AgBF4 solution in acetone (the same concentration as the initial
[(1,5-COD)IrCl]2 precursor concentration). No visually
observable precipitation of AgCl is seen, confirming the expected
removal of HCl during the evacuation step to yield the HCl-free Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n product. To establish the limit of Cl– (and
thus HCl) detectability in the added Ag+ experiment, a
control was performed with 0.012 mM Bu4N+Cl– (i.e., 1% relative to 1.2 mM Ir) plus 1.2 mM AgBF4 in acetone: a readily visualized AgCl precipitate is seen,
in turn showing that even a 1% level of residual Cl– would have been easily detected by the above simple, effective,
AgCl precipitation test. Taken together, the results demonstrate that
the HCl has been removed at the >99% level from the Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n(Cl–H+)b nanoparticle sample. The resultant desired, isolable, and redispersible,
yet still highly catalytically active Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n nanoparticles
possess a by-design low level of ligation that, however, is sufficient
to allow the nanoparticles to be both isolated and then redispersed.

Note that a roughly average Ir(0)∼150 nanoparticle
has ca. 0.6 of its total Ir atoms on the surface of the nanoparticle
so that one expects the 0.2 equiv of POct3 present to be
tightly bound in the as-formulated, Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n nanoparticles.
While clearly much more remains to be done further characterizing
and studying the Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n nanoparticles, including
their quantitative poisoning behavior,74,75 there can
be little doubt that minimally ligated, WLLL-derived nanoparticles
such as Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n hold considerable promise in catalysis
and other applications. A wide range of other ligands, mixed ligand
combinations, and other surface-directed chemistry should now be possible
by the same route using the Ir(0)n·(Cl–H+)b WLLL approach,
as well as through further reactions of the isolable Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2n nanoparticles as Scheme 2 begins to make apparent. Ligands of interest include
those identified in prior, valuable studies by others.9,45,69−71

γ-Al2O3-Supported, Labile Ligand
Nanoparticles-Derived Ir(0)n/(γ-Al2O3)(Cl–H+)
The Ir(0)n·H+Cl– nanoparticle is also applicable to the synthesis of supported heterogeneous
catalysts76−81 (i.e., and as was hypothesized to be what was occurring when molecular
sieves were added to Ir(0)n·H+Cl– nanoparticles previously59). The work that follows closely mirrors our
previously published work,82−85 but ties it into the Ir(0)n·H+Cl– nanoparticle WLLL and synthon
concepts and, hence, is included in this report for the sake of completeness.

As before,82,83,85 a supported version of the precatalyst, [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]/γ-Al2O3, was isolated first and then reduced under H2, in acetone, and in the presence of cyclohexene (Scheme 5 (top)). A cyclohexene
reporter reaction, shown in the bottom half of Scheme 5, allows one to monitor the nanoparticle
formation reaction.82,83,85 The stoichiometry of the reaction was confirmed as before82 by demonstrating (gas–liquid chromatography
(GLC), and NMR) the evolution of 1.0 ± 0.1 equiv of cyclooctane.82

Reaction of Interest for Ir(0)n/(γ-Al2O3)(Cl–H+)-Supported
Nanoparticle Heterogeneous Catalyst Formation82
The observed sigmoidal kinetics
along with the fit to the Finke–Watzky
two-step mechanism of slow continuous nucleation (A → B, rate
constant k1), followed by fast autocatalytic
surface growth (A + B → 2B, rate constant k2) of this nanoparticle formation reaction,60 implies that near-monodisperse (≤±15%
size dispersion14) nanoparticles should
be formed.83,86 Indeed, the resultant supported
nanoparticles are 2.9 ± 0.4 nm (±14%) and are an active
(24 ± 5 turnovers/s at 22.0 ± 0.1 °C) and long-lived
catalyst (360 000 total catalytic turnovers of cyclohexene
hydrogenation).83 These results both verify
our prior work83,84 and demonstrate that the Ir(0)n·H+Cl– WLLL
nanoparticle approach is of value in preparing supported-nanoparticle
heterogeneous catalysts, specifically Ir(0)n/(γ-Al2O3)(Cl–H+).

These catalysts contain only H+Cl–, cyclohexane, acetone solvent, and the support as
possible ligands.
The controlled reaction stoichiometry82 and resultant product are therefore important aspects of the synthetic
route to the present WLLL nanoparticles. The WLLL nanoparticle synthetic
route and resultant supported nanoparticle have several advantages
(i.e., compared to first forming the nanoparticles, depositing them
on a support, and then trying—largely unsuccessfully16−25—to remove all of the stabilizing ligands86−88): (i) the WLLL
approach does not require the use of polymer or other, excessive or
strong-binding ligands that can poison catalysis and block surface
sites needed for other applications; (ii) the WLLL approach eliminates
separate nanoparticle isolation and deposition steps, and additionally
(iii) the fit of the sigmoidal kinetics to the two-step mechanism
imply that nine insights into the synthesis of nanoparticle catalysts86 should also apply to the resultant products,
including the following four chosen for illustration here: (a) the
formation of near-monodisperse particles;82 (b) the ability of the added ligands to attach to growing nanoparticle
facets and induce shape control,82 (c)
size control over the resultant supported-nanoparticle heterogeneous
catalyst;89 and (iv) rational syntheses
of all possible geometric isomers of, for example, bi- or multimetallic
nanoparticles.82 Overall, the results offer
strong support for the efficacy of the WLLL nanoparticle route to
supported-nanoparticle heterogeneous catalysts.83,85

Additional Possible Applications of WLLL Nanoparticles
A
look back at Scheme 2 shows a couple of additional—among many other conceivable—uses
of WLLL nanoparticles. One is to make the nanoparticles in ionic liquids,
well-known excellent stabilizers of nanoparticles, an application
that already has good precedent,34,90−94 particularly in Dupont and co-worker’s seminal studies starting
with [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 to form biphasic, ionic liquid-stabilized
Ir(0)n nanoparticle alkene hydrogenation
catalysts.91

Using volatile buffers
as meta-stabilizing ligands is another, interesting, conceivable way
to make a different version of WLLL nanoparticles (Scheme 2) vide supra. The idea here
is to use known volatile buffers, such as ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3) and ammonium hydrogen carbonate
((NH4)HCO3), as potential meta-stabilizers.
If they could provide sufficient meta-stabilization, then these salts
have the desirable, well-established property of being volatile (buffers)
so that they could, then and in principle, conceivably be readily
and completely removed under mild heat and vacuum conditions as shown
in eq 1 (neat ammonium
carbonate decomposing according to eq 1 at 60 °C and 1 atm, and in dodecane solution
at 100 °C, for example95,96) 1   2  This idea intrigued us enough that we tested
it experimentally, if just initially. The first problem we ran into
is that neither ammonium carbonate nor ammonium hydrogen carbonate
is soluble in acetone or propylene carbonate, the two organic solvents
we have emphasized for our nanoparticle preparations. However, using
(Bu3NH)2CO3 in acetone generated
in situ from [(1,5-COD)Ir(MeCN)2]2CO3 with 1 equiv Bu3N (added as the base needed to scavenge
H+ generated in the H2 reduction of the [(1,5-COD)Ir(I)+] moiety) followed by reduction under H2 did yield
a brown, nanoparticle-containing solution, which exhibited 2.2 ±
0.7 nm particles by TEM. Unfortunately, once taken to vacuum to isolate
them, the “Ir(0)n·(CO3)(Bu3NH)2” nanoparticles are
not redispersable in acetone (see the SI for details), and hence apparently not sufficiently stabilized to
be isolable. Accordingly, the “volatile buffer” approach
is labeled in Scheme 2 as “undemonstrated”, but included here because of
the interesting nature of the volatile buffer concept and the hope
that suitable variations of it might work based on the creative ideas
and efforts of others.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the example
of Ir(0)n·H+Cl– as a WLLL, isolable, yet
effectively coordinatively unsaturated nanoparticle system has been
illustrated and expanded herein based on H2 reduction of
a [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 precatalyst in acetone. The use of the
meta-stable Ir(0)n·H+Cl– as a valuable synthetic structural unit/building block
was illustrated by the preparation of five specific nanoparticle products:
Ir(0)n·(Cl–Bu3NH+)a, Ir(0)n·(Cl–Dodec3NH+)a, Ir(0)n·(POct3)a(Cl–H+)b, Ir(0)n·(POct3)a, and the γ-Al2O3-supported
heterogeneous catalyst, Ir(0)n·(γ-Al2O3)a(Cl–H+)b. In the case of the Ir(0)n·(Cl–Bu3NH+)a nanoparticles, it was shown
that HCl could be quantitatively (≥98%) removed by mild heating,
opening the door for removal of the volatile HCl in cases where doing
so is desired. Removing HCl from Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2(Cl–H+)b in vacuum at 30 °C yields
isolable and redispersible Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2 nanoparticles ≥99% free of HCl, nanoparticles
that can be weighed out as a solid for any desired application, and
nanoparticles that retain their high catalytic activity post redispersion
in acetone.

The case of the POct3-stabilized nanoparticles,
Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2, is especially
significant in that just 0.2 equiv of POct3 was demonstrated
to provide well-formed, reasonably well-stabilized, size-controlled
Ir(0)∼150 nanoparticles—thereby opening up
in-progress quantitative kinetic, mechanistic, SAXS, and other studies
of size control as a function of precisely known amounts of added
ligand, L, which start from ≪1 equiv of L per metal present
in Ir(0)n·(POct3)0.2.

Presented in Scheme 2 are additional possibilities for exploiting the WLLL
nanoparticle
concept, for example, the use of other, readily removable ligands
such as volatile buffers. The ready commercial availability of labile
ligand organometallic precursors/precatalysts analogous to [(1,5-COD)IrCl]2 such as [(1,5-COD)RhCl]2, (1,5-COD)PtCl2, Ru(COD)(COT),
as well as other precursors that one can imagine to labile ligand
nanoparticles fuels our hope that others will add to and expand the
examples and applications of WLLL nanoparticles in their own research.

Experimental
Section
Materials
All commercially obtained reagents were used
as received unless otherwise noted. All solvents were stored in a
≤1 ppm O2 drybox prior to use. Acetone packed under
nitrogen was purchased from Burdick & Jackson (water content <0.5%).
Cyclohexene (Aldrich, 99%) was freshly distilled over sodium metal
under argon and stored in a predried glass bottle. [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 (STREM), tris(dodecyl)amine (Aldrich, 97%), trioctylphosphine
(Aldrich, 97%), and tributylamine (Aldrich, ≥99.5%) were stored
in a drybox. Solutions (1.0 M) of proton sponge (Aldrich) in acetone
were freshly made. Acidic γ-Al2O3 (Aldrich)
with a surface area of 155 m2/g was dried at 160 °C
for 24 h and stored in the drybox prior to use. CD2Cl2 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) from 1 mL glass ampoules
were transferred into the drybox for NMR sample preparation. H2 gas was purchased from General Air in >99.5% purity and
passed
through O2 and H2O scavenging traps (Trigon
Technologies) before use to pressurize Fisher-Porter (FP) bottle reactors
(vide infra).

Analytical Instrumentation and Procedures
Unless otherwise
reported, all reaction solutions were prepared under oxygen and moisture-free
conditions in a Vacuum Atmospheres nitrogen-filled drybox. The O2 level (≤1 ppm O2) was continuously monitored
by a Vacuum Atmospheres O2 sensor. Gas–liquid chromatography
(GLC) was performed using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Series II GC with
an flame ionization detector equipped with a 30 m (0.25 mm i.d., 25
μm film) Supelco SPB-1 column coupled with a Hewlett-Packard
3395 integrator. The GLC parameters are: initial temperature, 50 °C;
initial time, 3 min; ramp, 10 °C/min; final temperature, 160
°C, final time, 16 min; injector port temperature, 180 °C;
detector temperature, 200 °C; and injection volume, 2 or 4 μL.
High-resolution 1H (300.115 MHz) and 13C (75.472
MHz) NMR spectra were taken on a Varian INOVA-300 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was carried out in a TA Instruments TA 2950 thermogravimetric
analyzer (with integrated Balzers mass spectrometer) using Pt pans,
in a He purged atmosphere. The ramping rate used was 2 °C/min
until the appropriate temperature was reached. TEM analysis was done
using a Philips CM-12 TEM with a 70 μm lens operating at 100
kN and with a 2.0 Å point-to-point resolution, and a JEOL JEM-2100F
transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV was used to take
bright-field STEM images of iridium(0) nanoparticles deposited on
an silicon nitride grid (Ted Pella, Inc.). TEM images were analyzed
by using Public-Domain Image-Processing Program.97 Typically, TEM pictures of each sample were taken at three
different magnifications (100, 200, and 430 K) to obtain information
about the sample.

Hydrogenation Apparatus and Data Handling
Hydrogenation
experiments were carried out in a custom-built, previously described73 apparatus to continuously monitor hydrogen pressure
loss. Briefly, the apparatus consists of a Fisher-Porter (FP) bottle
modified with Swagelok TFE-sealed quick-connects to both a H2 line and an Omega PX621 pressure transducer. The pressure transducer
is interfaced to a PC via an Omega D1131 5 V A/D converter with an
RS-232 connection. Pressure uptake data were collected using LabView
7.1 and analyzed using Origin 7.0 when the data could be fit to the
known two-step autocatalytic mechanism.60 The hydrogen uptake curves were converted to cyclohexene consumption
curves before analyzing via Orgin 7.0, which is done by using the
known 1:1 H2 to cyclohexene stoichiometry and the previously
established cyclohexene reporter reaction kinetic method.60

Preparation of Ir(0)n·H+Cl– Nanoparticles for Acetone
Hydrogenation
As previously described and reproduced as a
control experiment,59 in a 2 dram glass
vial, 1.2 mg (3.6 μmol
of Ir) of the precatalyst [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 was weighed
and dissolved in 0.5 mL (6.7 mmol) of acetone (added with a 1.0 mL
gastight syringe), to yield a clear, yellow solution. The solution
was then transferred via a disposable polyethylene pipet into a new
22 × 175 mm2 Pyrex culture tube containing a new 5/16
in. × 5/8 in. Teflon-coated stir bar. The culture tube was then
sealed inside the FP bottle, brought outside the drybox, placed in
a constant-temperature water-circulating bath at 22.0 ± 0.1 °C,
and attached via Swagelok TFE-sealed quick-connects to the hydrogenation
line described in the above section. Stirring was started (>600
rpm;
this stirring rate is important to avoid H2 gas-to-solution
mass-transfer limitations), and the FP bottle was then purged 15 times
with hydrogen (15 s per purge), stirred vigorously for an additional
30 s, and then t = 0 was noted.

Preparation
of Ir(0)n·Bu3NH+Cl–-Stabilized Nanoparticles
In the drybox,
1.8 μmol (3.6 μmol in Ir) [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 was
weighed into a 2 dram predried glass vial. Subsequently,
2.5 mL of acetone and 0.5 mL of cyclohexene were added via gastight
syringes to the 2 dram vial. Next, 3.6 μmol tributylamine was
added to the vial, and the resulting solution was mixed with a disposable
polyethylene pipette and transferred into a new borosilicate culture
tube (22 × 175 mm2) with a new 5/8 in. × 5/16
in. Teflon-coated octagon-shaped stir bar. A standard conditions hydrogenation
was performed following the previously developed procedure.73

Preparation of Ir(0)n·POct3-Stabilized Nanoparticles
Preparation
of trioctylphosphine
stock solution: In the drybox, 1.0 mmol POct3 was transferred
via a 1 mL gastight syringe from the bottle (Aldrich, 97%) into a
septum-sealed, 20 mL bottle by weighing the amount of transferred
liquid. Then, 9.6 mL of cyclohexane was added to the bottle. The total
volume of solution was 10.0 mL, and the concentration of POct 3 was 100 mM. A 100 μL aliquot of this solution was transferred
into a 5.0 mL volumetric flask, and the volume was completed to 5.0
mL by adding cyclohexane. The POct3 concentration of this
solution was 2.0 μmol/mL. A preselected aliquot of this solution,
to achieve the desired concentrations noted in experiments in the
main text, was then added to the precatalyst solution.

In a
2 dram glass vial, 1.2 mg (3.6 μmol of Ir) of the precatalyst
[Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 was weighed and dissolved in 2.14 mL of
acetone to yield a clear, yellow solution. The solution was then transferred
via a disposable polyethylene pipet into a new 22 × 175 mm2 Pyrex culture tube containing a new 5/16 in. × 5/8 in.
Teflon-coated stir bar. To this solution, a 360 μL aliquot of
the trioctylphosphine solution (360 μL × 2.0 μmol/mL
= 0.72 μmol POct3) and 0.5 mL of cyclohexene were
added. A standard conditions hydrogenation was performed following
the previously developed procedure.73

After the first run of hydrogenation, the FP bottle was taken into
the drybox. The solution in the culture tube was connected to vacuum
and brought to dryness for 3 h (10–1 Torr, 25 °C).
The residue in the culture tube was redispersed in 2.5 mL of acetone.
After addition of 0.5 mL of cyclohexene, the culture tube was then
sealed inside the FP bottle, brought outside the drybox, placed in
a constant-temperature water-circulating bath at 22.0 ± 0.1 °C,
and attached via Swagelok TFE-sealed quick-connects to the hydrogenation
line. A standard conditions hydrogenation was then performed following
the previously developed procedure.73

Catalyst Lifetime Experiments from [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 with
Added Bu3N
The catalyst lifetime experiment
was performed identically to those previously published.59 In the drybox, 0.72 μmol [Ir(COD)Cl]2 and 0.72 μmol Bu3N were dissolved in 4.5
mL of acetone added via a 10 mL gastight syringe. The resulting solution
was mixed using a disposable polyethylene pipette and transferred
into a new borosilicate culture tube (22 × 175 mm2) with a new 5/8 in. × 5/16 in. Teflon-coated octagon-shaped
stir bar. Next, 4.5 mL (44 mmol, corresponding to a maximum of 61 000
turnovers) of cyclohexene was added to the culture tube and then the
FP bottle was sealed and brought out of the drybox. The FP reactor
was purged and set to 40 psig, as described above.

The reaction
was monitored by periodically withdrawing aliquots of the reaction
solution for 1H NMR spectroscopy. This monitoring was accomplished
by sealing the FP bottle, disconnecting it from the hydrogenation
line and then transferring the vessel back into the drybox. Aliquots
were removed inside the drybox by using a 9 in. glass Pasteur pipette
inserted into the reaction solution and drawing out 0.05 mL of aliquots.
The aliquot was then added to 1 g of CDCl2 in an individual
glass ampoule and mixed using a Pasteur pipette, which was then transferred
to an NMR tube. The FP bottle was then resealed, taken out of the
drybox, reconnected to the H2 line, and the above-noted
purge cycle with H2 to restart the hydrogenation reaction
was repeated. The NMR tube containing the reaction aliquot was sealed
and brought out of the drybox, and a 1H NMR spectrum was
obtained.

Preparation of Ir(0)n/γ-Al2O3-Stabilized Nanoparticles
The precatalyst
solutions were prepared in the drybox using preselected [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]/support
weight-to-weight ratios following the procedure described elsewhere.82 Each individual sample was then transferred
via a disposable polyethylene pipette into the new borosilicate culture
tube (22 × 175 mm2) containing a new 5/8 in. ×
5/16 in. Teflon-coated octagon-shaped stir bar. A standard conditions
hydrogenation was performed following the previously developed procedure.73

Preparation of TEM Grids
Following
the hydrogenation
of cyclohexene (and acetone) and the formation of nanoparticles, the
FP bottle was sealed, disconnected from the H2 line, and
transferred into the drybox. The reaction solution was quantitatively
transferred with a disposable polyethylene pipette into a clean, 5
mL screw-capped glass vial. The solution was dried under vacuum of
<10–1 Torr at 30 °C for 3 h and then the
glass vial was sealed and brought out of the drybox. The dry nanoparticle
samples were sent as solids (in screw-capped glass vials) to Clemson
University for TEM investigation. There, 1 mL of acetonitrile was
added just before the TEM was obtained. A drop of this solution was
then redispersed on a chloroform-cleaned, carbon-coated Cu TEM grid.
Ir(0)n/γ-Al2O3 TEM samples were prepared by dipping a TEM grid into the resultant
nanoparticle solution for 5 s.

The solutions used for the preparation
of grids for bright-field STEM images were exactly the same ones prepared
in the respective sections above. At the end of complete hydrogenation
of cyclohexene (and acetone), the FP bottle was detached from the
hydrogenation line via its quick-connects, brought back into the drybox,
and its acetone solution was quantitatively transferred with a disposable
polyethylene pipette into a clean, 2 dram glass vial. A 0.2 mL aliquot
of the solution was added into 1 mL 2-butanone in the 2 dram vial
for dilution, 0.1 μL of the diluted solution was dropped via
a micropipette on a silicon nitride grid, and the excess liquid was
removed by quickly wicking away from the lower edge of grid. The grids
were left in the drybox for drying for a minimum of 2 h prior to start
with the electron microscopy analysis.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
Sample Preparation for [(1,5-COD)IrCl]2 with Bu3N
Two scaled up hydrogenations
containing 3.6 μmol [(1,5-COD)IrCl]2 and 7.2 μmol
Bu3N, 2.5 mL of acetone, and 0.5 mL of cyclohexene were
performed. The nanoparticle solutions were transferred into the drybox
and combined. The volatiles (acetone and cyclohexane) were gently
removed under vacuum of <10–1 Torr at 30 °C
in an effort to minimize the possible loss of Bu3N and
HCl in this necessary step. The black residue was then transferred
into an aluminum TGA capsule and sealed in the drybox by mechanical
press. Immediately prior to TGA analysis, a hole was placed in the
capsule and the sample pan was placed in the TGA for analysis.

a The average size of the iridium(0)
nanoparticles was estimated on the basis of an assumed face-centered
cubic structure for iridium: n = (N0ρ(4/3)π(D/2)3)/W,73 where n is the number of Ir atoms, N0 = 6.022 × 1023 mol–1, ρ
is the room-temperature density of iridium (22.5 g/cm3), D is the diameter of iridium nanoparticles, and W is the atomic weight of iridium (192.22 g/mol).72 This calculation yields Ir∼150 for an average diameter of ∼1.5 nm.
