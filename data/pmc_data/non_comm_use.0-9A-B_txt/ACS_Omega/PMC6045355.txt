Interactions between DNA and adsorbed
poly(l-lysine) (PLL)
on liquid crystal (LC) droplets were investigated using polarizing
optical microcopy and epi-fluorescence microscopy. Earlier, we demonstrated
that adsorption of PLL to the LC/aqueous interface resulted in homeotropic
orientation of the LC and thus exhibited a radial configuration of
the LC confined within the droplets. Subsequent adsorption of DNA
(single-stranded DNA/double-stranded DNA) at PLL-coated LC droplets
was found to trigger an LC reorientation within the droplets, leading
to preradial/bipolar configuration of those droplets. To our surprise,
subsequent exposure of complementary ssDNA to ssDNA/adsorbed PLL-modified
LC droplets did not cause the LC reorientation. This is likely due
to the formation of polyplexes (DNA–PLL complex) as confirmed
by fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy. In addition,
dsDNA-adsorbed PLL droplets have been found to be effectively useful
to displace (controlled release) propidium iodide (a model drug) encapsulated
within dsDNA over time. These observations suggest the potential for
a label-free droplet-based LC detection system that can respond to
DNA and may provide a simple method to develop DNA-based drug nanocarriers.

Introduction
Recently, micrometer-sized
liquid crystal (LC) droplets dispersed
in aqueous media have been exploited to the development of functional
materials for the realization of a new class of sensitive communicators
of targeted species.1−17 Because of having a large surface area with high spatial resolution
and a very high sensitivity, they offer routes toward advancement
of new passive biosensors. The detection principle is based on the
change in the configurational transition of the LC within the droplets
that can be easily visualized with the naked eye under an optical
microscope. For example, droplet-based LCs have been reported as a
sensing platform for developing immunoassays4 and detecting glucose,5 bacterial endotoxin
at the pg mL–1 concentration,6 bacteria and viruses,7 KB cancer
cells,9 cholic acid,10 and many more.11−14 Recently, we have shown that layer-by-layer (LbL)
coating of poly(l-lysine) (PLL) on LC droplets can provide
a simple design for cell-based sensors.17−19 In addition, these PLL-coated
droplets were shown to be useful for the detection of healthy and
apoptosis cells that are difficult to achieve via other analytical
techniques. In this paper, we have exploited the behavior of PLL-coated
LC droplets which could be particularly useful for sensitive detection
of DNA and can find applications in controlled release of drug molecules
from DNA-functionalized LC droplets. DNA has been widely offering
numerous applications in sensing, diagnostics, and gene therapy,20−22 and more recently, self-assembled DNA nanostructures have emerged
as promising candidates to serve as nanocarriers for drug delivery,
primarily because of their biocompatibility and the natural ability
of DNA to associate with several anticancer agents, for example, doxorubicin.23 Efforts are being made on developing relevant
designs to predict and study the drug release behavior as well as
release mechanisms applicable to a wide range of nanosized dosage
forms.24,25 As DNA-based drug delivery systems start
to advance toward clinical use, we wanted to further explore LC/aqueous
interface of PLL–LC droplets to develop new principles for
understanding and studying the real-time controlled release profile
of anti-cancer drugs encapsulated in DNA molecules.

A literature
survey reveals a wide range of approaches to detect
DNA using LCs.26−32 For example, Schwartz and co-workers showed that interactions between
ssDNA and a cationic surfactant led to changes of surfactant coverage
at the LC/aqueous interface and triggered an orientational ordering
transition of the LC from the homeotropic to a planar state.26,27 Subsequent hybridization with complementary ssDNA (c-ssDNA) governed
a reorientation of the LC at those interfaces. The same group also
demonstrated that the conformational change of the adenosine aptamer
upon binding with adenosine led to LC reorientation at the LC/aqueous
interface.28 Yang and co-workers developed
a new strategy of detecting DNA targets using self-assembled cholesterol-labeled
DNA probes at the LC/aqueous interface in a planar geometry.29 Tan et al. demonstrated that the conformational
changes of the DNA probe mediated by various metal ions cause the
reorientation of the LCs.30 Wu and co-workers
described the detection of a target gene in high sensitivity through
changes in the optical response of the LC caused by formation of self-assembly
of DNA dendrimers from hairpin DNA probes by the hybridization chain
reaction at the surfactant-doped LC/aqueous interface.31 Munir and Park demonstrated use of an LC-based
DNA biosensor for the detection of traces of myricetin that propitiate
the cleavage of DNA and thus results in an ordering transition of
the LC.32 Recently, Yang and co-workers
reported that the assembly of DNA–lipid amphiphiles could not
trigger the orientational ordering of LCs at the LC/aqueous interface.
However, in the presence of lipids, the DNA–lipids preferred
to form net-like structures which disappeared after hybridization
with the complementary DNA.33 However,
no efforts have been made till today that can exploit the speed and
sensitivity of LC droplets to detect DNA. In this paper, we first
demonstrated that PLL-coated LC droplets can be used to detect DNA
that are mediated by topological defects leading to configurational
transitions of those droplets. In addition, responsive DNA-functionalized
PLL droplets have been found useful to displace propidium iodide (PI),
a model drug, encapsulated in DNA over time, thereby providing a template
for controlled drug release.

The study reported in this paper
was motivated by two goals. First,
we sought to develop a simple design for the detection of DNA using
a droplet-based LC sensor that can be observed as changes in the optical
appearance of the LC using optical microscopy. The design builds from
our prior reports17−19 that demonstrated a simple LbL method to prepare
PLL-coated droplets in which PLL strongly interacts with the LC and
triggers a configurational transition of the LC from bipolar to radial.
We hypothesized that negatively charged DNA can strongly adsorb on
positively charged PLL-coated LC droplets, leading to LC reorientation
of those droplets. Second, we sought to demonstrate a simple template
that can displace a model drug encapsulated in DNA over time from
these LbL nano-films and can be a promising approach to develop new
and alternative way for drug delivery. We have been successful to
show that under physiological conditions, these DNA-adsorbed PLL droplets
exhibit release of PI encapsulated in DNA molecules over time.

Results
and Discussion
In our previous work, multilayer LbL coating
of alternate poly(styrene
sulphonate) and PLL, with PLL being the outermost layer on the LC
droplets, revealed the stabilization of the radial configuration of
the LC droplets.17 These PLL-coated LC
droplets have been found to respond to the cellular environment by
triggering the configurational transitions of the LCs from radial
to bipolar. Motivated by our prior studies,17−19 first, we aimed
to fabricate single PLL layer-coated LC [4-cyano-4-pentylbiphenyl
(5CB)/E7] droplets and sought to determine the ordering of the LC
within those droplets. In the presence of PLL, LC emulsion droplets
(at pH 7.0) undergo an ordering transition from bipolar to radial,
confirming adsorption of PLL at LC/aqueous interfaces. The stabilization
of radial droplets is primarily due to the intermolecular hydrogen
bonding between 5CB LC and PLL, as reported earlier.17 Under cross polarizers, they exhibited radial configuration
having a cross-like appearance (Figure 1a). This was further supported by a bright field micrograph
that shows a single-point defect at the center of the droplets (indicated
by the blue arrow in Figure 1c). These PLL-coated LC droplets were found to be stable in
the radial configuration for several months (as shown in Figure S1), and the zeta potential has been measured
as +25.0 mV, suggesting the coating of cationic PLL residues. It should
be noted that PLL-modified 5CB droplets showed coexistence of radial
and bipolar LC droplets below pH 7.0, which is consistent with the
previous report.17 Therefore, we carried
out the experiments at pH 7 and above to observe the interactions
of PLL with DNA (see below).

micrograph images
of PLL-coated LC droplets in contact with: (a,c) 0 μM ssDNA
and (b,d) 30 μM ssDNA. The LC droplets were in radial states
(a,c) before but transitioned to a bipolar/preradial state (b,d) 10
s after the addition of ssDNA. The insets within (a–d) indicate
the higher magnification version of the red arrow-marked LC droplet.
Blue arrows in (c,d) indicate the point defect in the center of a
radial droplet and two defects at the poles of a bipolar droplet,
respectively. Scale bar = 50 μm.

Our next experiment was sought to determine whether these
PLL-coated
LC micro-droplets would respond to the presence of anionic DNA. Interestingly,
the addition of 30 μM ssDNA on 5 μL (∼104 droplets) of PLL–5CB droplet emulsion resulted in a rapid
change (<10 s) in the director configuration of the LC molecules
from radial to bipolar/preradial when observed under crossed polars
(as shown in Figure 1b). Bright-field microscopy confirms the bipolar/preradial configuration
exhibiting twopoint defects at the poles of the droplets (indicated
by the blue arrows in Figure 1d). This experiment suggests that DNA is likely adsorbed on
PLL-coated LC droplets and the rapid ordering transition is likely
due to the strong electrostatic interaction between negatively charged
DNA and positively charged PLL (vide infra).

Adsorption of ssDNA
on the PLL-modified 5CB droplets was investigated
by the fluorescence and bright-field microscopy of PLL–5CB
droplets. The strong fluorescence on the surface of the 5CB droplet
(Figure 2a) confirmed
the presence and adsorption of FAM–ssDNA at PLL–5CB
droplets, and the bright-field microscopy image of the same droplet
(Figure 2b) reveals
bipolar configuration of the PLL-modified 5CB droplets which further
supports the adsorption of negatively charged ssDNA on positively
charged PLL–5CB droplets. These observations established that
the configuration transition mediated by topological defects of the
PLL–5CB droplets can be monitored to provide a fast and real-time
optical detection of ssDNA. This is primarily driven owing to strong
electrostatic interactions between negatively charged oligonucleotides
and positively charged PLL moieties at the interface.

image (a) and the corresponding bright-field
image (b) of a PLL-coated 5CB droplet following 60 min incubation
with 30 μM FAM-tagged fluorescent ssDNA. Green fluorescence
on the surface of the droplet supports the adsorption of ssDNA on
PLL-coated droplets. The bright-field image confirms the bipolar configuration
of the 5CB droplet. Scale bar = 10 μm.

In the next experiment, we sought to determine the effect
of varying
the concentration of ssDNA on the orientational ordering of the LC
within PLL–5CB droplets. Figure 3a,e and 3b,f correspond to the
polarizing optical microcopy (POM) images of the PLL–LC droplets
before and after 10 s of the addition of 10 and 5 μM ssDNA,
respectively. The corresponding bright-field micrographs are shown
in Figure 3c,g and 3d,h. A change in the configuration of the droplets
from radial to bipolar/preradial was observed in both cases. After
careful investigation of these images, it was found that when the
concentration of ssDNA is 10 μM (CssDNA = 10 μM), most of the PLL–5CB droplets are able to
induce the configurational transition of the LC within those droplets.
By contrast, introduction of 5 μM ssDNA (CssDNA = 5 μM) revealed co-existence of both bipolar and
radial LC droplets. Therefore, in the next set of experiments, we
sought to draw an analogy between the number of droplets demonstrating
radial-to-bipolar/preradial transition upon adsorption of varying
concentration of ssDNA. From the transition plot in Figure 3i, we observed that the number
of PLL–5CB droplets demonstrating radial-to-bipolar/preradial
transition decreases with the decrease in the concentration of ssDNA
added. More precisely, we note three key findings. First, for CssDNA ≥ 10 μM, all droplets (100%)
change their configuration from radial to preradial/bipolar. Second,
for 0.2 μM ≤ CssDNA <
10 μM, only a fraction of the droplets (10–90%) show
the radial-to-preradial/bipolar transition which decreases with the
decrease in the concentration of ssDNA (upto 0.2 μM). Third,
there is no configuration transition of the PLL–5CB droplets
observed when the concentration of CssDNA < 0.2 μM.

Figure 3 Polarized optical (a,b,e,f) and bright-field (c,d,g,h)
images of
the PLL–LC droplets before (a,c,e,g) and after 10 s of addition
of 10 μM (b,d) and 5 μM (f,h) ssDNA, respectively. The
insets within (a–h) illustrate the higher magnification version
of the arrow-marked LC droplet. Graph (i) shows % conversion of PLL–LC
droplet configuration from radial to bipolar/preradial on the addition
of varying concentration of ssDNA with a fixed amount of PLL–5CB
droplets (5 μL). Inset shows the enlarged view of the plot representing
the concentration of ssDNA less than 1 μM. Scale bar = 70 μm.

In Figure 4, zeta
potential (ζ-) measurements reveal that PLL–5CB droplets
have cationic charge density with a ζ-value of +49.6 mV, particularly
because of the cationic amino groups of the PLL chains adsorbed at
the LC/aqueous interface. This value decreases in magnitude with the
increasing concentration of ssDNA attaining a saturation value of
approximately −15.6 mV at CssDNA = 10 μM. The negative ζ-values can be attributed to
the anionic phosphate groups of the ssDNA backbone adsorbed at the
surface of PLL–5CB droplets. From the percent transition plot
and the ζ-measurements, we found that 10 μM ssDNA is the
minimum concentration of ssDNA required to show the configurational
transition of all radial 5CB droplets to bipolar/preradial. Below
this concentration, some PLL–5CB droplets show the bipolar/preradial
configuration while others remain in the radial configuration, likely
because of not enough adsorption of ssDNA on PLL–5CB droplets.

Figure 4 Zeta potential
of PLL-coated LC droplets with varying concentrations
of ssDNA. With increasing concentrations of ssDNA on PLL–LC
droplets, zeta potential values drop from positive to negative, suggesting
the adsorption of anionic ssDNA at the LC/aqueous interface.

It may be hypothesized that the
sensitivity of the PLL–5CB
droplets toward ssDNA can be increased by modulating the volume of
PLL–5CB emulsion. To verify this, the volume of PLL–5CB
droplet emulsion is reduced from 5 to 1 μL following the addition
of the constant volume (5 μL) of different concentrations of
ssDNA. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 5, the concentration of ssDNA required to
trigger the configurational transition (radial to bipolar/preradial
for all droplets) of the LC within the droplets is reduced to 1 μM.
We found that when the concentration of ssDNA is between 1 and 0.05
μM (1 μM < CssDNA ≥
0.05 μM), co-existence of the radial, preradial, and bipolar
droplets was observed. The number of bipolar droplets decreases with
the decreasing concentration of ssDNA. However, below 0.05 μM
of ssDNA (CssDNA < 0.05 μM),
no change in the director configuration was observed in the PLL–5CB
droplets. Therefore, we infer that the sensitivity of the PLL–5CB
droplets toward ssDNA can be increased to 50 nM by decreasing the
volume of emulsion of PLL–5CB droplets to 1 μL. The huge
decrease in the detection limit of ssDNA from 200 to 50 nM by decreasing
the volume of emulsion from 5 to 1 μL can be attributed to the
following two factors: first, the reduced number of droplets in the
sample which reduces the requirement of the amount of the anionic
ssDNA needed to trigger a transition in PLL–5CB droplets. Second,
the reduced volume of the emulsion results in the less dilution of
the ssDNA sample, thus ultimately raising the amount of ssDNA available
for adsorption at PLL–5CB droplets.

Figure 5 Graph showing % transition
of PLL–LC droplet configuration
from radial to bipolar/preradial on the addition of varying concentrations
of ssDNA with the fixed volume of PLL–5CB droplets (1 μL)
(with the limit of detection = 50 nM ssDNA with 20% change in droplets).

Next, we sought to monitor the
hybridization of ssDNA at PLL–5CB
droplets with its c-ssDNA sequence on those droplets. To our surprise,
the addition of c-ssDNA onto ssDNA-coated PLL–5CB droplets
does not trigger the reordering in the orientational transition of
LC molecules; these droplets remain bipolar or preradial as before
(Figure 6a–f).
This observation is contrary to the earlier findings by Schwartz and
co-workers which demonstrated that ssDNA and dsDNA impose different
orientational ordering of the LC molecular axis at the surfactant-laden
LC/aqueous interface.26,27 They proposed that the ionic
interaction between the anionic phosphate backbone of ssDNA and the
cationic surfactant along with the hydrophobic interaction between
nucleobases and LC are likely responsible for homeotropic to planar
orientational ordering of the LCs, while upon hybridization, the nucleobases
no longer remain exposed to interact with the LC, thereby allowing
more surfactant molecules to self-assemble at the LC/aqueous interface,
leading to the reorientation of the LCs to the homeotropic alignment.
In our case, the reordering of the LC does not take place in presence
of c-ssDNA. We propose a plausible event taking place in the ssDNA–PLL–5CB
system. First, ssDNA forms a very strong ionic complex with PLL (i.e., polyplex) at the LC/aqueous interface, thereby causing an
orientational transition of PLL–LC droplets from radial to
bipolar/preradial. Being a high-molecular-weight cationic polymer,
PLL can be expected to effectively neutralize the repulsion between
ssDNA and c-ssDNA and allow the hybridization to occur between nucleobases
of the two strands without disturbing the PLL–ssDNA interaction
at the droplet interface. Second, the hybridized dsDNA remains adsorbed
at the surface of PLL–LC droplets and maintains the anionic
charge density on the PLL–LC droplets required to retain the
bipolar/preradial configuration of those droplets. Therefore, we add
that perhaps hydrophobic interactions between nucleobases and LCs
do not play any significant role in determining the internal configuration
of the director of LCs inside the PLL–LC droplets. In addition,
hybridization could also be restricted because of formation of polyplexes
between ssDNA and PLL at the LC/aqueous interface.

Figure 6 LC response to ssDNA
adsorption and hybridization with c-ssDNA:
polarized microscopy images (a,c,e) and bright-field images (b,d,f)
of the PLL-coated 5CB droplets before (a,b), after subsequent adsorption
of 10 μM ssDNA (c,d) and after the addition of the 10 μM
c-ssDNA target (e,f). Scale bar = 50 μm.

To prove the above hypothesis, we carried out a series of
experiments.
First, we intend to visually locate c-ssDNA upon addition into ssDNA–PLL–5CB
droplets. When FAM–c-ssDNA–(ssDNA–PLL–5CB)
droplets were imaged under fluorescence and bright-field microscopy,
green fluorescence was spotted around the surface of the bipolar 5CB
droplets, confirming the presence of c-ssDNA on the ssDNA–PLL–5CB
droplets (Figure 7a,b).
Here, we would like to state that the fluorescence observed on FAM–c-ssDNA–(ssDNA–PLL–5CB)
droplets was less intense than that of the FAM–ssDNA–PLL–5CB
droplets (keeping the exposure time constant). This can be explained
by the restricted adsorption of FAM–c-ssDNA molecules on the
ssDNA–PLL–5CB droplets, primarily because of the less
exposed nucleobases of the ssDNA for H-bonding with c-ssDNA (after
ssDNA forms polyplexes with PLL), (vide infra) at the LC/aqueous interface.

Figure 7 Epi-fluorescence
microscopic image (a) and corresponding bright-field
image (b) of an ssDNA-adsorbed PLL–5CB droplet after incubation
with 30 μM FAM-tagged fluorescent c-ssDNA. Little fluorescence
at the surface of droplets shows the presence of c-ssDNA while the
bright-field image confirms the bipolar configuration of PLL–LC
droplet. Scale bar = 10 μm.

Our next goal was to determine the formation of polyplexes
between
ssDNA and PLL at the LC/aqueous interface. For that, 30 μM FAM–ssDNA
was incubated with PLL–5CB droplets in the presence of excess
PLL. Fluorescence microscopic and bright-field investigations in Figure 8a–c reveal
the intense fluorescent structures present at the bipolar droplets’
surface and in the surrounding solution. The observed fluorescent
structures in Figure 8b,c are proposed as a result of complex formation between ssDNA and
PLL, that is, polyplexes resulting probably due to the attractive
electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged phosphate
backbone of ssDNA and positively charged PLL.

Figure 8 Bright-field (a) and
corresponding epi-fluorescence microscopic
image (b) of a PLL–5CB droplet after adsorption of 30 μM
FAM-tagged fluorescent ssDNA in the presence of excess PLL. Epi-fluorescence
microscopic image (c) corresponds to another PLL–5CB droplet
after adsorption of 30 μM FAM fluorescent ssDNA clearly showing
the presence of fluorescent polyplexes at the surface of the droplet.

Our next goal was to characterize
the morphology of polyplexes
formed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). In Figure S2a, the AFM image of polyplexes shows the spherical-shaped
structures with their sizes ranging from ∼60 to ∼400
nm in diameter, which is consistent with the previous reports.34,35 When ssDNA or PLL alone was observed by AFM (Figure S2b,c), no such structures were observed, which confirms
the formation of compact nanocomplexes between PLL and ssDNA as shown
in Figure S2a. Further, to understand the
strength of the polyplex along with its ability to release ssDNA from
the polyplex, the effect of the polyplex on the orientational configuration
of PLL–5CB droplets was monitored. A preincubated mixture (5
μL) of 0.5 mg/mL PLL and 50 μM ssDNA was added to 5 μL
PLL–5CB droplets already placed on a glass slide. It was observed
that the radial configuration of the PLL–5CB droplets remains
unchanged upon introduction of polyplexes, suggesting the unavailability
of ssDNA to cause the configurational transition of the PLL–5CB
droplets (Figure 9a,b).
Moreover, when 30 μM of free ssDNA was added on the same PLL–5CB
droplets, the LC droplets changed their configuration from radial
to bipolar/preradial in less than 10 s (Figure 9c). These observations strengthen our proposition
that ssDNA forms a very stable and strong polyplex with PLL. As a
result, ssDNA is not freely released from the polyplex. Thus, it is
unable to interact with PLL at the surface of PLL–5CB droplets,
ultimately failing to trigger the configurational transition of the
LC droplets.

Figure 9 Polarized microscopy images of PLL–5CB droplets
(a) before,
(b) after the addition of a preincubated mixture of 0.5 mg/mL PLL
and 50 μM ssDNA and (c) after 30 s of subsequent addition of
free ssDNA. The polyplex fails to trigger the radial-to-bipolar configuration
of LC droplets, suggesting unavailability of free ssDNA; however,
subsequent addition of free DNA rapidly induces the director configuration
transition from radial to bipolar/preradial. Scale bar = 50 μm.

To further visually locate the
ssDNA in the polyplex on PLL-coated
5CB droplets, a fluorescent polyplex was prepared by adding 50 μM
FAM-ssDNA with 0.5 mg/mL PLL and then subsequently incubated with
PLL–5CB droplets for 30 min in the dark. As expected, PLL–LC
droplets were seen to retain the radial configuration with a single
defect at the center of the droplets as observed under bright-field
microscopy. In fluorescence microscopy, little fluorescence around
the droplet was observed, and intensely fluorescent polyplex structures
(highlighted in Figure S3a) were observed
near the 5CB droplet, suggesting that a very small amount of ssDNA
from the polyplex is adsorbed at the surface of the PLL–5CB
droplet. Besides, this amount of anionic charge density of ssDNA cannot
induce the bipolar/preradial configuration in PLL-coated 5CB droplets
(Figure S3). In addition, a literature
survey reveals how the PLL’s high affinity for DNA has been
the limiting factor in successful transfection during gene delivery.
High-molecular-weight PLL-based polyplexes have shown a reduced capacity
for dissociation than their low-molecular-weight counterparts which
dissociate readily and are more efficient in transfection.36 Our experiments add further insight in understanding
how the orientational ordering of the LC inside the PLL-coated 5CB
droplets are triggered by anionic charge density of DNA at the LC/aqueous
interface provided by either polyplex formation after adsorption of
ssDNA or c-ssDNA after hybridization at the LC/aqueous interface.

Next, we sought to verify the role of interactions of nucleobases
with the 5CB LC or PLL in decoding the orientational transitions of
PLL–5CB droplets. As a proof of concept, we chose dsDNA which
offers an anionic phosphate backbone and unexposed nucleobases and
further hypothesized that dsDNA would provide the similar orientational
response of PLL–5CB droplets as was seen with ssDNA. When 5
μL of 30 μM dsDNA was introduced on 5 μL PLL–5CB
emulsion droplets, initial radial droplets started changing their
configuration to bipolar/preradial within seconds of addition, and
100% droplets changed to bipolar/preradial within 10 min as observed
under POM and bright-field microscopy (Figure 10a–d). When fluorescently labeled
dsDNA was used, dsDNA was preferentially located at the surface of
the droplets, confirming the adsorption of dsDNA at the surface of
PLL–5CB droplets (Figure 10e,f). The configuration transition of PLL–LC
droplets upon adsorption of dsDNA reveals the importance of electrostatic
forces between DNA (ssDNA/dsDNA) and PLL over hydrophobic interactions
between nucleobases and 5CB molecules. This proves that hydrophobic
interactions between ssDNA and the LC are unlikely responsible for
configuration transition from radial to bipolar/preradial in PLL–LC
droplets.

with 30 μM dsDNA. The LC droplets were in radial states (a,c)
before but transitioned to a bipolar/preradial state (b,d) after the
addition of dsDNA. The insets within (a–d) indicate the higher
magnification version of the red arrow-marked LC droplet. Scale bar
= 50 μm. Bright-field microscopic (e) and corresponding epi-fluorescence

present on the surface of the droplets supports the adsorption of
FAM-tagged dsDNA. Scale bar = 10 μm.

After establishing the principles that trigger DNA-induced
configurational
transition in PLL-coated LC droplets, we planned to exploit the stronger
affinity of those PLL–LC droplets for DNA and sought to demonstrate
if our novel PLL-coated LC droplets could provide a platform to understand
and study the controlled drug release profile from dsDNA-based drug
delivery systems. For this, we propose that anticancer drug molecules
intercalated in dsDNA be released over time when the dsDNA–drug
complex comes in contact with PLL–LC droplets as a result of
competitive interaction between dsDNA and PLL–5CB droplets.
As a proof of concept, PI displacement assay was employed as PI and
ethidium bromide displacement fluorescence assay are the most commonly
used methods to investigate the binding of polyammonium cations to
DNA.37−40 This assay was employed because of the two important functions that
PI fulfills. First, PI binds to dsDNA only (not ssDNA) enhancing fluorescence
emission of PI (20–30 times more than that of the isolated
PI), providing a straightforward quantification of the PI encapsulated
in dsDNA (as confirmed in Figure S4). This
fluorescence assay rules out the contribution of fluorescence intensity
from the released PI present in the solution. Second, it (PI) intercalates
in between the dsDNA strands via noncovalent interactions such as
H-bonding and pi–pi stacking interactions with its nucleobases,
similar to the mechanism by which various antitumor drugs such as
doxorubicin bind to the DNA bases.41 Therefore,
PI presents itself as a best drug substitute in our study.

Motivated
by this, next, we designed experiments to observe the
effect of the dsDNA–PI complex on the configuration of the
PLL–LC droplets. Herein, PI-encapsulated FAM-labeled dsDNA
was incubated with PLL–LC droplets for 30 min prior to the
observation. In Figure 11a, bright-field microscopy reveals the bipolar droplets, confirming
the configurational transition of the PLL–LC droplets. Fluorescence
microscopy images (Figure 11b,c) reveals the direct correspondence between the location
of PI (red) and dsDNA (green) fluorescence at the surface of the droplets,
confirming the adsorption of the dsDNA–PI complex at PLL–LC
droplets. In particular, the fluorescent PI was favorably confined
at the LC/aqueous interface of the droplet where the green fluorescent
dsDNA was present.

epi-fluorescence
microscopic images (b) under 460 nm excitation filter and a 534 nm
emission filter showing green fluorescence of FAM–dsDNA and
(c) red fluorescence of PI on a PLL–5CB droplet following 30
min incubation with PI-intercalated FAM-tagged dsDNA. Scale bar =
10 μm.

Next, we sought to study
the behavior of the PI release profile
from DNA at room temperature upon interaction of the dsDNA–PI
complex with PLL–5CB droplets with time using steady-state
fluorescence. Herein, we used nonfluorescent dsDNA and incubated it
with PI so as to avoid the complexity in the system. The detected
fluorescence intensity of PI was plotted against the droplet incubation
time (Figure 12a).
In the presence of the PLL solution, it can be seen that fluorescence
intensity of PI upon the addition of PLL decreased to almost half
within 30 min and to minimum in 2 h, reflecting that PLL effectively
and swiftly displaces the PI from the dsDNA–PI complex, whereas
in the absence of PLL, the fluorescence intensity of PI remains approximately
the same over a period of 6 days, suggesting the stable intercalation
of PI in dsDNA strands over this period of time. This observation
is in agreement with the previous studies where binding of the various
PLLs to plasmid DNA has been studied using a fluorescence quenching
assay involving ethidium bromide.42,43 However, when
the dsDNA–PI complex was incubated with PLL–5CB droplets,
red fluorescence intensity of PI started decreasing gradually, dipping
to approximately its one-third value in 144 h (demonstrated by the
black plot in Figure 12a). These data show that PI-binding sites in DNA become gradually
unavailable with increasing PLL–DNA binding at the LC/aqueous
interface. The gradual decrease in the fluorescence intensity can
be explained by the limited effectiveness of the PLL bound on 5CB
droplets than the free PLL which rapidly displaces PI from DNA. Even
after 6 days, (DNA–PI)–PLL–5CB droplets were
found to retain their bipolar configuration, confirming the sustained
and stable adsorption of FAM-tagged dsDNA at PLL–LC droplets
(Figure S5). Hence, the PLL–5CB
droplets have been shown as a novel prototype where the LC (5CB) droplet
interface slowly induces drug release from DNA while maintaining the
adsorption of DNA at the interface which can be monitored by the internal
configuration of the LC droplets. Figure 12b shows the cartoon representation of the
orientational configurations of the PLL–LC droplets upon adsorption
of the DNA–PI complex and after the release of PI from the
complex induced by PLL–5CB droplets over time.

of PLL–LC droplets and PLL indicates the controlled and fast
release of PI from the DNA–PI complex, respectively. (b) Schematic

Conclusions
In summary, our study describes that PLL-coated
5CB droplets provide
a simple method to detect ssDNA/dsDNA at aqueous/LC interfaces. Our
approach is able to detect oligonucleotides through changes in the
configurational transition of the droplets from radial to bipolar
or preradial. The method is highly sensitive, and we believe that
electrostatic interactions between PLL and DNA (and not hydrophobic
interaction of nucleobases) play a major role for the ordering transition.
We also show that DNA-functionalized PLL-coated droplets can be used
as a simple measure to study the controlled drug (model) release from
the DNA–drug complex, utilizing the stronger competitive interaction
of DNA with PLL that weakens the interaction between DNA and drugs.
These findings demonstrated the use of PLL-coated LC droplets to study
other biological interactions and also open a new venture in further
development to study the controlled drug release from DNA-based drug
delivery systems.

Experimental Section
Materials
Oligonucleotide
sequences TGG TGA AGT AGA
TGT GTA (ssDNA), TAC ACA TCT ACT TCA CCA (C-ssDNA), TTT CGC AAT GAC
TGT ACT (NC-ssDNA), and FAM-TGG TGA AGT AGA TGT GTA (FAM-ssDNA) were
purchased from IDT Technologies. PI, 5CB, TBS, and poly-l-lysine (PLL) solution 0.1% (w/v) in H2O (mol. wt. 225
kDa) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The E7 LC was
obtained from Merck (Mumbai, India). Deionization of a distilled water
(DI water) source was performed using a Milli-Q system (Millipore,
Bedford, MA). Fisher’s Finest Premium grade glass microscopic
slides were obtained from Fischer Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA).

Preparation
of PLL-Modified LC Droplets
PLL-modified
LC (5CB or E7) droplets were formed as follows. First, 5CB droplets
were prepared by vortexing 10 μL of the LC in 1 mL of DI water,
followed by sonication for 5 min. The resultant emulsion was centrifuged
at 5000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was replaced by 1 mg/mL
PLL solution. The PLL–LC droplets were kept for 30 min at room
temperature for the adsorption of PLL on the LC droplets. Adsorption
of PLL on the surface of the LC droplets leads to the radial configuration
of the director of LC molecules inside the droplet. The PLL-modified
LC droplets were then washed with DI water through centrifugation
to remove the excess PLL and were re-suspended in DI water or TBS
at different pH for further experiments. To estimate the number of
droplets in the emulsion, 1 μL of the PLL–5CB droplet
emulsion was placed on a clean glass slide, and multiple POM images
were captured to illustrate the whole sample area. From the POM images,
the total number of droplets was counted to be ∼2 × 103 droplets per μL. The size of the polydispersed PLL-coated
LC droplets ranges from 5 to 40 μm as conceived from the POM
images.

Optical Characterization of PLL-Modified LC Droplets
The orientational ordering of the LC was determined using a Zeiss
polarizing microscope (Scope.A1 with cross polars with magnifications
×200 and ×1000). All images were captured using a AxioCam
Camera.

Adsorption of ssDNA
In experiments associated with
the adsorption of ssDNA on PLL-coated 5CB droplets, 5 μL of
the aqueous solution of ssDNA of different concentrations was added
on 5 μL of 5CB emulsion (if not stated otherwise) already placed
on a clean glass slide. The droplets were real-time imaged under polarized
optical and bright-field microscopes. For the transition curve of
adsorption of ssDNA, a fixed volume of PLL–LC emulsion droplets
(5 or 1 μL) was exposed to different concentrations of ssDNA
with a constant adsorption time (20 min), and the percent transition
of the droplets from radial to preradial/bipolar upon the addition
of ssDNA (calculated from three sets of experiments) was plotted against
the concentration of ssDNA (Figure 3i). Excess PLL-containing PLL–5CB droplets were
prepared by sonicating 10 μL 5CB in 1 mL aqueous solution of
PLL and used as such without removing the unbound PLL by centrifugation.
These experiments were also reproduced using PLL-modified E7 droplets
(data not shown).

Zeta Potential Measurements
Zeta
potential measurements
of the PLL-coated 5CB droplets were carried out using the Zetasizer
Nano ZS90 instrument (Malvern Instruments Inc.) at room temperature
under a cell-driven voltage of 30 V. In a typical experiment, 40 μL
of PLL–5CB droplets was diluted with DI water to a total volume
of 800 μL before transferring into the zeta potential cuvette,
and the average of 5 scans was taken for each measurement. For experiments
with ssDNA, 10 μL of stock solution of ssDNA was added to the
40 μL of PLL–5CB droplet emulsion to make the final required
concentration of ssDNA and incubated for 15 min before diluting to
800 μL aqueous solutions.

Epi-fluorescence Imaging
of the Aqueous/LC Interface of the
PLL–LC Droplets
PLL-coated 5CB droplets (50 μL)
were incubated with 30 μL of 30 μM FAM–ssDNA (final
concentration of ssDNA becomes 11.25 μM) for 60 min and washed
thrice with a buffer prior to fluorescence imaging performed with
a Zeiss (Scope.A1) fluorescence microscope. For experiments with c-ssDNA
on ssDNA–PLL-modified 5CB droplets, 30 μL of 30 μM
FAM-tagged c-ssDNA was introduced in 11.25 μM ssDNA-coated PLL–5CB
emulsion (80 μL) and incubated for 60 min prior to fluorescence
investigation. The samples were viewed using a fluorescence filter
cube with a 460 nm excitation filter and a 534 nm emission filter.
Images were obtained with an AxioCam camera attached to the microscope.

Steady-State Fluorescence of PI Encapsulated inside DNA on PLL–5CB
Droplets
All steady-state fluorescence measurements were
carried out on a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer from Horiba Jobin
Yvon at ∼25 °C. dsDNA was prepared by mixing equal volumes
of ssDNA and c-ssDNA of the same molar concentration for 12 h at room
temperature. Hybridization of the ssDNA and c-ssDNA has been confirmed
by the gel electrophoresis (see Figure S6). Encapsulation of PI with dsDNA was carried out by mixing together
150 μM dsDNA and 375 μM PI and incubated for 48 h in the
dark with occasional mild stirring. The stock mixture (6 μL)
containing 150 μM dsDNA and 375 μM PI was added in 200
μL TBS (pH 7.4) or 200 μL 0.5 mg/mL PLL or 200 μL
PLL-coated 5CB droplets emulsion suspended in TBS (pH 7.4) and kept
for incubation for 10 min in the dark at room temperature. Aliquots
from the samples were withdrawn at different time intervals, and the
fluorescence intensity of PI (three measurements) was collected at
the following parameters: λex = 540 nm, λem = 617 nm, excitation slit width = 1 nm, emission slit width
= 4 nm, and integration time = 2 s. All fluorescence data were acquired
using the FluorEssence software (provided with the instrument) which
were later re-plotted using Origin Pro version 9 software.

Atomic
Force Microscopy
Samples of PLL or ssDNA were
prepared by diluting 10 times the aqueous solution of 0.5 mg/mL PLL
or 50 μM ssDNA. The diluted sample (5 μL) was loaded on
a freshly cleaved, water-washed muscovite mica (Grade V-4 mica from
SPI, PA) and allowed to air dry for 15–20 min. Polyplexes were
prepared by mixing together the aqueous solutions of ssDNA and PLL,
yielding final concentrations of 50 μM ssDNA and 0.5 mg/mL PLL,
respectively, which was further diluted 10 times before proceeding
for AFM as described above.
