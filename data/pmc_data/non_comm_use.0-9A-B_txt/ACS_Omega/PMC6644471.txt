It is an urgent challenge
to develop low-cost and high-performance
catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We synthesized
nanoparticulate electrocatalysts consisting of cobalt-doped goethite-type
iron oxyhydroxide (α-FeOOH) with controlled Co/Fe ratios [CoxFe1–xOOH
(x ≤ 0.20)] based on our own wet process.
A Co0.20Fe0.80OOH-coated glassy carbon electrode
generated a current density (j) of 10 mA cm–2 at an overpotential (η) as small as 383 mV (1.61 V vs the
reversible hydrogen electrode) in an alkaline electrolyte, with a
small Tafel slope of 40 mV dec–1 and excellent durability,
whereas pure α-FeOOH required η = 580 mV to reach the
same current density. This can be ascribed to the effect of Co doping,
which resulted in an increase in electrochemically active surface
area and a decrease in charge-transfer resistance. The content of
cobalt, a scarce resource, in the catalyst is much smaller than those
in most of the other Fe-based catalysts reported so far. Thus, this
study will provide a new strategy of designing cost-effective and
high-performance catalysts for the OER in alkaline solution.

Introduction
Conversion of renewable
energy sources such as sunlight, wind,
and geothermal heat to clean and sustainable fuels has attracted much
attention because of the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and growing
environmental concerns. Hydrogen has a great potential as an energy
carrier because it does not exhaust carbon dioxide as a combustion
product. Hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting by
means of renewable energy is a promising approach. However, the slow
kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 2H2O →
4H+ + O2 + 4e–) taking place
at the counter electrode reduces the total efficiency of the water
electrolysis system and therefore needs a high overpotential to generate
adequate current.1,2 So far, most of the high-performance
electrocatalysts for the OER have been made of precious metals, that
is, MOx (M = Ru and Ir).3−5 However, their scarcity and toxicity limit their widespread use.
Accordingly, it is of prime importance to create cost-effective and
highly efficient catalysts composed of much more earth-abundant elements.
Over the past decades, tremendous efforts have been made to solve
this problem by the use of transition metals (e.g., Co, Ni, Fe, and
Mn) to substitute precious metal-based catalysts.6−8 Among transition
metals, iron, one of the most abundant metals in the earth, has gained
limited attention as a catalyst for the OER. Because iron oxyhydroxide
(FeOOH) has an open structure and is abundant in the environment and
inexpensive,9,10 it has been applied to not only
catalysts but also supercapacitors11,12 and rechargeable
batteries.13,14 However, the intrinsically poor
electrical conductivity of FeOOH (∼10–5 S
cm–1) remains the main obstacle to good performance
in its electrochemical applications.9 Pure
FeOOH is highly unstable in alkaline electrolyte at high anodic potentials
because of its oxidization to a soluble species, FeO42–.9 Doping is a commonly
used strategy to tune the electrical properties of transition-metal
oxides and (oxy)hydroxides, yielding hybrid materials with desired
properties in various applications.15−17 As a result, binary-metal
oxyhydroxides have exhibited an enhancement of the OER activity compared
to their parent single-metal species. For example, Swierk et al. reported
that iron-doped nickel oxyhydroxide [FexNi1–xOOH (x =
0.35)] afforded a current density of 10 mA cm–2 at
a small overpotential of 320 mV with a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec–1, although both values changed for the worse with
time.17 Zhang et al. synthesized CoxFe1–xOOH
(x = 0.54) nanoparticles with an akaganeite structure
(β-FeOOH) showing an overpotential of 390 mV to achieve a 10
mA cm–2 current with a Tafel slope of 47 mV dec–1.18 In both cases, the
contents of Ni and Co are larger than that of Fe in the binary-metal
oxyhydroxide. Considering that Ni and Co are also classified as scarce
metals, their use should be minimized in the design of catalysts.
Here, we aim to develop an outstanding OER catalyst consisting of
Co-doped iron oxyhydroxide whose Co content is lower than those of
any other Fe-based catalysts with comparable catalytic activity.

Results
and Discussion
A series of catalysts were synthesized with
different CoSO4 to FeSO4 molar ratios in solution.
The same molar
ratios were confirmed in the resulting products by inductively coupled
plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) measurements. X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of the products are depicted in Figure 1. A sample that was
synthesized without CoSO4 exhibited the pattern assignable
to goethite-type iron oxyhydroxide (α-FeOOH) (JCPDS no. 29-0173).
The same pattern was observed for the samples made with different
CoSO4 concentrations, where no peak shift was accompanied.
With an increase in the content of Co, all diffraction peaks were
broadened due probably to a decrease in crystalline size. No feature
associated with Co oxides/hydroxides was detected. This indicates
that Co ions were successfully doped into the lattice of goethite
(α-FeOOH) without forming any other phases. Hereafter, the obtained
Co-doped products will be denoted as Cox(Fe1–xOOH) (x = 0.09, 0.17, and 0.20).

different CoSO4/FeSO4 molar ratios where the
FeSO4 concentration
was fixed at 0.8 M: (a) 0, (b) 0.09:0.91, (c) 0.17:0.83, and (d) 0.20:0.80.

Morphology of the synthesized
CoxFe1–xOOH powders was investigated by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the obtained images are
displayed in Figure 2. Spindlelike particles, which are characteristic of α-FeOOH,
are seen in Figure 2a, which are ∼1 μm in length and ∼200 nm in width.
A similar shape appears in Figure 2b, the size of which decreases with the doping of Co.
The images in Figure 2c,d consist of the aggregates of finer particles. This observation
agrees well with the broadening of the diffraction peaks in Figure 1.

(a) FeOOH and (b–d) CoxFe1–xOOH, x = (b) 0.09, (c) 0.17, and
(d) 0.20.

Figure 3a shows
the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the CoxFe1–xOOH samples coated
on a glassy carbon (GC) rotating disk electrode (RDE) (rotation rate:
1600 rpm), which were recorded in an O2-saturated 1.0 M
KOH solution. Here, a slow scan rate of 1 mV s–1 was applied to minimize the capacitive current, while the iR drop between the working and reference electrodes was
corrected. For comparison, the commercial RuO2 powder was
subjected to the same test. The contribution from the carbon additives
was negligibly small. For OER performance evaluation, the operating
potential necessary to reach a current density (j) of 10 mA cm–2 is often compared.19 Pure α-FeOOH needed an overpotential of 580 mV to
achieve 10 mA cm–2, corresponding to low activity.
Contrary to this, when cobalt was introduced into the catalyst, the
overpotential decreased depending on its content, that is, 580 mV
(α-FeOOH) > 451 mV (Co0.09Fe0.91OOH)
>
404 mV (Co0.17Fe0.83OOH) > 383 mV (Co0.20Fe0.80OOH). Clearly, the doping of Co into α-FeOOH
enhanced its catalytic activity toward the OER. It is noteworthy that
the Co-doped catalysts showed a monotonous increase in the OER current
at more positive potentials, which was not true in the nondoped FeOOH
and commercial RuO2 catalysts. As expected, from the TEM
images in Figure 2,
the Co doping also led to smaller crystalline sizes and poor crystallinity,
which would result in a structure favorable for the diffusion of reactants
and products during the OER.

Figure 3 (a) LSV curves of CoxFe1–xOOH taken in an O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH
solution at a scan rate of 1 mV s–1 and (b) the
corresponding Tafel plots.

As indicated in Figure 3b, the linear portion of the Tafel plot was fitted
to the
Tafel equation (η = b log j + a, where η is the overpotential and j is the current density) to determine the slope. The OER
onset potential was determined from the beginning of linear portion
in the Tafel plot,19 and the values are
summarized in Table 1, together with η at 10 mA cm–2 and Tafel
slopes. The Co doping shifted the onset overpotential to less positive
values as the Co content increased. The smallest Tafel slope was measured
to be 40 mV dec–1 for Co0.20Fe0.80OOH, which is much smaller than those of pure α-FeOOH (77 mV
dec–1), commercial RuO2 (66 mV dec–1), and other Co-doped FeOOH samples (42–46
mV dec–1). Clearly, the Co doping into the goethite
lattice can kinetically facilitate the OER process. A further increase
in the Co content of the catalyst did not cause a significant improvement
in the OER activity. Considering the cost effectiveness, Co0.20Fe0.80OOH can be regarded as the best catalyst. Table
S1 (Supporting Information) summarizes
the OER performance of the electrocatalysts composed of pure and mixed
oxides and (oxy)hydroxides based on Fe, Co, and Ni, including our
catalysts.17,18,20−23 All data were acquired on the usual GC rod electrode. As seen from
this table, the present catalyst (Co0.20Fe0.80OOH) contains a larger amount of Fe than the others with comparable
performance.

To
further investigate the OER performance of the catalysts, turnover
frequency (TOF) was estimated for pure and Co-doped FeOOH samples.
TOF is generally defined as the number of produced molecules per mole
of the catalyst per unit time, which can be derived from the following
equation.24 1  where j is the measured current
density (mA cm–2) at η = 380 mV, which is
the overpotential required for Co0.20Fe0.80OOH
to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm–2, as described
above. S is the geometric surface area (0.196 cm2) of the working electrode, F is the Faraday
constant (96 485 C mol–1), and n is the total molar number of Co and Fe in the catalyst loaded on
the GC surface, which was determined based on ICP-AES measurements.
The faradaic efficiency for the OER is assumed to be 100%. From the
figure, the TOF value at η = 380 mV was enhanced with increasing
the Co content (Table 1), that is, FeOOH (0.00011 s–1) < Co0.09Fe0.91OOH (0.0013 s–1) < Co0.17Fe0.83OOH (0.0055 s–1) < Co0.20Fe0.80OOH (0.0103 s–1). The TOF value
of 0.0103 s–1 observed for Co0.20Fe0.80OOH is the same order of those obtained for Co0.54Fe0.46OOH (0.0225 s–1 at η = 390
mV) and Co0.67Fe0.33OOH (0.0142 s–1 at η = 300 mV) reported in very recent papers.18,25

It is generally accepted that when the crystalline size becomes
smaller, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) increases,
and as a result, the OER performance is improved. Thus, we estimated
the ECSA of pure and Co-doped FeOOH samples based on the electrochemical
double-layer capacitance (Cdl) taken by
using a simple cyclic voltammetry (CV) method because the Cdl is proportional to the ESCA.26Figure S1 shows the CV curves
recorded in the potential region where no faradaic current was observed.
The Cdl was estimated for each catalyst
by plotting the Δj (=ja – jc, where ja and jc are the anodic and
cathodic current densities at the mid potential, respectively) as
a function of the scan rate, as shown in Figure 4. The slope of the straight line is equivalent
to twice the double-layer capacitance. The ECSA can be determined
from the Cdl of the catalyst surface according
to eq 2. 2  where we used a typical Cs value of 0.040 mF cm–2, which was
reported for an atomically smooth metal electrode in an aqueous KOH
solution.26 The estimated Cdl and ECSA values of all catalysts are included in Table 1, along with their
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas. As seen
from Table 1, Co0.20Fe0.80OOH coated on a GC substrate provided Cdl = 0.80 mF cm–2, which is
4.7-fold larger than that (0.17 mF cm–2) of pure
α-FeOOH. However, Co0.20Fe0.80OOH yielded
91-fold larger current (10 mA cm–2) at 383 mV, whereas
pure α-FeOOH delivered a 0.11 mA cm–2 current
density. Therefore, the enhancement of the OER performance that we
observed cannot simply be associated with the increased ECSA but also
another factor as described below. The former can facilitate the access
of reactants (OH–) in the electrolyte to the active
sites as well as the fast diffusion of reaction products (O2).

Figure 4 Relationship between Δj and scan rate observed
for GC-supported pure FeOOH and CoxFe1–xOOH samples in an O2-saturated
1.0 M KOH solution.

To investigate the electron-transfer
kinetics of the catalysts,
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out. Figure 5 displays the Nyquist
plots of the indicated catalysts on a GC electrode obtained at η
= 300 mV [+1.53 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] in KOH solution,
where the reaction is governed by the electron transfer. An equivalent
circuit model composed of electrolyte resistance (Rs), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and constant-phase element was employed for each catalyst.27 The kinetics of the electrocatalysis taking
place on an electrode can be reflected in the charge-transfer resistance
(Rct), and a lower Rct value corresponds to a faster reaction rate.27 The EIS parameters obtained by fitting the Nyquist
plots are summarized in Table 1. The semicircles in the plots of Co-doped catalysts were
much smaller than those of the nondoped one, which indicates a much
lower charge-transfer resistance, and it decreased in size with an
increase in Co content. This is highly accordant with the result of
the Tafel slope, indicating that a fast electron transfer can be realized
by the doping of Co into the goethite lattice.

Figure 5 Nyquist plots obtained
for pure and Co-doped FeOOH catalysts coated
on a GC electrode at η = 300 mV in a 1.0 M KOH solution by fitting
the EIS data to the equivalent circuit model presented in the bottom.

Durability is another crucial
factor to assess an electrocatalyst.
The long-term stability of CoxFe1–xOOH was tested by chronopotentiometry at a constant
current density of 10 mA cm–2, in comparison with
pure α-FeOOH, as shown in Figure 6. During the measurements, the electrode was rotated
at a speed of 1600 rpm. In α-FeOOH, the potential started to
increase abruptly after about 1 h, and the catalyst film was peeled
off from the substrate. This can be associated with the oxidative
dissolution of FeO42– at the positive
potential. On the other hand, Co0.20Fe0.80OOH
exhibited a nearly unchanged potential over at least 12 h. FeO42– could not be formed at such a low overpotential. Figure 6b shows the consecutive
CV curves of the Co0.20Fe0.80OOH electrode obtained
at a scan rate of 20 mV s–1. All four curves overlapped
almost exactly, corresponding to the excellent stability of the catalyst.

Conclusions
We synthesized nanoparticulate
electrocatalysts composed of cobalt-doped
goethite-type iron oxyhydroxide (α-FeOOH) with the controlled
Co to Fe ratio by the simple procedure. The GC-coated Co0.20Fe0.80OOH catalyst yielded a current density of 10 mA
cm–2 at a small overpotential of 383 mV in KOH solution,
with a small Tafel slope of 40 mV dec–1. The OER
catalytic performance achieved in this study is comparable to those
of the FeOOH composites, which contain much more amount of scarce
metals. This can be attributed to the effect of Co doping into the
goethite lattice, which causes an increase in the ECSA and a faster
electron-transfer kinetics. The catalyst also exhibited excellent
durability, essential for practical use.

Experimental Section
Materials
All materials were used as received without
further purification. A Nafion solution (Nafion 117, ∼5% in
a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water) and acetylene carbon
black (99.99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Strem Chemicals,
respectively. All other chemicals were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals.
All solutions were prepared with doubly distilled water.

Synthesis of
Catalysts
All catalysts were synthesized
according to the procedure reported by Kurokawa et al. with minor
modification.28 In brief, a mixed aqueous
solution consisting of ferrous sulfate (0.8 M) and sodium carbonate
(1.6 M) was prepared, to which cobalt sulfate was added so that the
Co/Fe atomic ratio in the solution was from 0 to 0.25. The resulting
slurry was aged for 4 h at 47 °C. Nitrogen bubbling was carried
out at a constant flow rate of 50 dm3 min–1. The slurry was further warmed to 53 °C and aerated at a constant
flow rate, 90 dm3 min–1, for the purpose
of oxidation. The precipitate was filtered out, washed thoroughly
with water, and then dried at 120 °C for 3.5 h.

Structural
Characterization
XRD patterns were recorded
on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.154051 nm). The data were collected over the 2θ
range from 10 to 70° at a scan rate of 1° min–1, applying a beam voltage of 40 kV and a beam current of 40 mA. TEM
was performed using a JEOL JEM 100S microscope operated at 80 kV.
The amounts of Fe and Co were determined based on ICP-AES using an
ICAP6500 DuO (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All samples were dissolved
with a concentrated HCl/HNO3 mixture in a 3:1 volume ratio
to make an aqueous solution. The surface areas of the powder samples
were estimated by BET gas adsorption of the catalyst particles, where
a Quanta Chrome Multisorb 16 was used.

Electrochemical Measurements
All electrochemical measurements
except for electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) were conducted
on an HZ-5000 potentiostat (Hokuto Denko) in a standard three-electrode
configuration. The working electrode was a RDE made of GC (5 mm in
diameter) embedded in a Teflon sheath. A Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) and
a platinum mesh were used as the reference and counter electrodes,
respectively. Catalyst powder (5.0 mg) and 5.0 mg of carbon were dispersed
in a mixture of 95 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt %) and 700 μL
of water/ethanol (1:1 in volume) and sonicated for 60 min to form
a homogeneous ink. The homogeneous ink (7.8 μL, containing 20
μg of catalyst) was drop-casted onto the RDE with a geometric
area of 0.196 cm2 (mass loading ∼0.20 mg cm–2) using a micropipetter, followed by drying in atmospheric
conditions for 30 min. To examine the catalytic performance for the
OER, LSV measurements were made from the open-circuit potential to
+1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl at a slow scan rate of 1 mV s–1 in an aqueous solution of 1.0 M KOH. The electrolyte solution was
bubbled with O2 for at least 30 min. Here, the RDE was
rotated at a constant rate of 1600 rpm to minimize mass transport
effects. All LSV polarization curves were corrected with iR compensation. The measured potentials versus Ag/AgCl were calibrated
to the RHE scale via the Nernst 3 (eq 3) 3  

Chronopotentiometry
and CV were utilized
to further evaluate the catalysts in terms of TOF and long-term durability.
EIS was conducted in the same three-electrode configuration connected
to an SP-150 potentiostat/galvanostat (Biologic Science Instruments).
Here, a static GC disk electrode (3 mm in diameter) was used as the
working electrode. The homogeneous catalyst ink (2.8 μL) was
drop-casted on the GC surface for the same mass loading of 0.20 mg
cm–2. All measurements were carried out at an overpotential
of 300 mV (1.53 V vs RHE) with an ac amplitude of 5 mV in a frequency
range from 100 mHz to 100 kHz.
