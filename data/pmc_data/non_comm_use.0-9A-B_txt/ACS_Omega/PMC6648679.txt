Metal-induced
allergic contact dermatitis, particularly nickel,
affects over 10% of the general population. Herein, chitosan–glycerol
gel as protective barrier formulation was synthesized by neutralization
reaction with an aim to reduce metal-ion diffusion into the skin to
prevent allergy. Active functional groups in chitosan–glycerol
gel were able to capture allergenic metal ions present in artificial
sweat solution. The efficacy of the barrier formulation against nickel-ion
penetration was evaluated ex vivo using pig skin. We found that the
percutaneous absorption of nickel ion reduced by ∼98% when
chitosan–glycerol gel was used as a barrier formulation.

1 Introduction
Metal contact dermatitis
(MCD) or metal allergy is an inflammatory
disease that is caused by exposure to metal ions of nickel, cobalt,
chromium, palladium, etc.1 Common sources
of allergenic metals are belt buckles, buttons, doorknobs, jewelry,
laptops, mobile phones, wrist watches, etc.2−4 Being electrophilic,
metal ions can ionize and bind to carrier proteins causing allergic
responses typical of rashes, swelling, and pain.5 Topical barrier formulations are common prophylaxis measures
for MCD that function as a protective layer against metal allergens.
These barrier formulations contain active ingredients that scavenge
the metal ions to form stable metal complexes. The existing barrier
formulations contain molecular chelators such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (DTPA), and clioquinol,
or nanoparticle-based formulations of CaCO3 and CaPO4.6−8 However, molecular chelator-based formulations of
EDTA and clioquinol are allergens in themselves, hence not widely
preferred.9−11 Praveen et al. demonstrated CaCO3 and
CaPO4 nanoparticles affinity for allergenic metal ions
and was effective in preventing penetration of nickel ion.8 However, homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles
could be a challenge since nanoparticles tend to agglomerate due to
high surface area and absence of surface modification or stabilizers.

Chitosan is a polycationic natural polysaccharide derived by partial
deacetylation of chitin.12 Chitosan has
wide pharmaceutical applications due to its characteristic properties
such as biocompatibility, nontoxicity, and antimicrobial and tissue
regeneration properties.13 The reactive
amino and hydroxyl groups in chitosan aid in chelation of various
heavy-metal ions, and are thus used as adsorbent of toxic heavy-metal
ions.14 An ideal barrier formulation in
addition to its function as a protective skin barrier should also
help in hydration of skin to treat symptomatic effects of MCD such
as drying, scaling, and skin fissures.15 Chitosan–glycerol (Cs) gel as a barrier formulation was explored,
where chitosan functions as a scavenger of metal ions and glycerol
as humectant and plasticizer.16

2 Results and Discussion
Alloys of nickel, cobalt, chromium,
and palladium are important
material with extensive engineering applications. The ubiquity of
these alloys in our daily lives makes it practically impossible to
avoid its exposure. With increasing number of metal allergy cases
reported, it is imperative to find an efficient, cost-effective, and
safe prophylactic for metal allergy. In this study, we have evaluated
the scope of chitosan–glycerol gel as an active barrier formulation
against major allergenic toxic metals ions that causes metal contact
dermatitis.

The efficacy of the Cs gel was determined by analysis
of chelated
metal ions in chitosan matrix using energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS) (Figure 1). The
presence of nickel in Cs gel was confirmed with characteristic peaks
of Lα at 0.851 keV, Kα at 7.480 keV, and Kβ at 8.267
keV. Chromium was confirmed with characteristic peaks of Cr at Kα
at 5.415 keV, Kβ at 5.947 keV, and Lα at 0.573 keV. Similarly,
cobalt characteristic peaks were displayed at Lα at 0.776 keV
and palladium at Lα at 2.838 keV.

Figure 1 Energy-dispersive spectroscopy
of (a) Cs, (b) Cs–Ni, (c)
Cs–Cr, (d) Cs–Co, and (e) Cs–Pd (inset: scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images (scale bar 300 μm)).

The amount of chelated metal to
chitosan–glycerol gel was
quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS)
by calculating the difference between the initial and final concentrations
of metal ions present in the supernatant after 14 h incubation of
Cs gel in the artificial sweat solution containing metal ions.
The bar chart in Figure 2 shows that Cs gel was effective in absorbing >99% of the metal
ions
from the solution in the case of nickel, cobalt, and palladium and
lower in the case of chromium. The lower chelation efficiency in the
case of chromium can be explained by the dual competition between
CrO42– and OH– to the
surface of chitosan, where OH– is predominant.17,18 These results were superior to those of DTPA-based formulations
that had not been effective against chromium and palladium.19

gel.

The structural analysis of Cs
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Figure 3a displayed chitosan’s
characteristic narrow peak at 20°; however, the peak broadened
with minor increase in the case of chitosan–metal complexes,
suggesting disordered crystal structure after metal complexation.20,21Figure 3b shows the
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of chitosan and chitosan–metal
complexes of nickel, chromium, cobalt, and palladium. Chitosan characteristic
peaks are recorded at 3284 cm–1 corresponding to
−NH and −OH stretching vibrations, 2880–2934
cm–1 corresponding to C–H symmetric and asymmetric
stretchings, and 1031 corresponding to C–O stretching vibration.
After forming metal complexes, the peaks corresponding to −NH
and −OH stretching vibrations shift to a lower wavenumber,
i.e., 3267, 3252, 3272, and 3253 cm–1 for Cs–Ni,
Cs–Cr, Cs–Co, and Cs–Pd, resepectively. The shift
of peaks corresponding to −NH and −OH stretching vibration
is related to coordination bonding between the bonding electron pair
on the nitrogen atom in the −NH2 group and the electron
in vacant D orbital of transition metal. Metal-complexed chitosan
shows broader peaks in the range 900–1200 cm–1, which are also evidence of disordered structure with lower crystallinity.22,23 The material characterization studies confirm the formation of stable
metal–amine or metal–hydroxyl complexes in Cs
gel. However, the amine group in chitosan has a pKa of 6.3; hence, Cs remains soluble at weakly acidic solutions.24 In the present case, the metal chelation testing
was done in the artificial sweat solution (EN 1811:2011) at pH 6.5
considering that the applied gel will encounter only sweat on practical
application.

and metal-complexed
gel and (c) ex vivo quantification of percutaneous absorption of nickel
ion on pig skin.

Several authors have
reported the ability of various metal ions
to penetrate through the skin by in vitro model of franz diffusion
cell.25,26 The efficacy of the prepared barrier formulation
to prevent metal ions from diffusion through the skin was evaluated
by recording the metal ion absorbed in skin in the presence and absence
of barrier formulation. Results in Figure 3c display that a significant amount of nickel
ions was absorbed onto the pig skin in both uncoated and glycerol-coated
samples. The minor increase in percutaneous absorption of nickel ion
in glycerol-coated samples relative to uncoated sample can be attributed
to glycerol acting as permeation enhancer.27 The Cs gel-coated sample effectiveness of chitosan–glycerol
gel as barrier formulation was confirmed with the significant reduction
(∼98%) in percutaneous absorption of nickel ions. Also, similar
results are expected on metal ions of Co, Cr, and Pd that were proven
to have comparable affinity to chitosan–glycerol gel.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the synthesized active topical
barrier formulation
of chitosan–glycerol gel exhibits high affinity to allergenic
nickel, chromium, cobalt, and palladium ions. Ex vivo permeation study
demonstrates that chitosan–glycerol gel was effective in significantly
reducing the penetration of nickel ions into the skin, thus potentially
reducing the chances of metal allergy.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
Chitosan of medium molecular
weight (190 000–310 000 Da) with 75–85%
deacetylation was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Acetic acid, ammonium
hydroxide, lactic acid, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide pellets,
urea of ACS grade, and glycerol of SQ grade were obtained from Fisher
Scientific. Chromium(III) sulfate hydrate, cobalt(II) sulfate heptahydrate,
nickel sulfate hexahydrate, and palladium(II) sulfate dihydrate of
reagent grade were obtained from Alfa Aesar. All solutions were prepared
in Milli-Q water of resistivity not less than 18.2 MΩ cm–1.

4.2 Preparation of Chitosan–Glycerol
Gel
One part of acetic acid was mixed with three parts of
glycerol
to form 1% chitosan solution. The solution was neutralized (pH 7)
with NaOH to obtain chitosan–glycerol gel. The obtained gel
was further washed by centrifugation for 5 min to remove neutralized
salts and free solvents. The amino group in chitosan has a pKa of 6.3; hence, the Cs remains soluble in weakly
acidic solutions.

4.3 Metal Chelation Studies
NiSO4 (10 mL, 0.05 M), CrSO4 (7 mL, 0.05
M), CoSO4 (10 mL, 0.1 M), and PdSO4 (9.5 mL,
0.03 M) were
made in EN 1811:2011 artificial sweat solution (0.5 wt % NaCl, 0.1
wt % lactic acid, 0.1 wt % urea, pH 6.5 adjusted with NH3). The chitosan–glycerol gel (4 g) was added to each prepared
metal solution and kept under agitation for 14 h. Post incubation,
the samples were centrifuged and supernatants were analyzed by inductively
coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS, Thermo Scientific, XSeries
2). Chitosan–glycerol gel (Cs) and metal-complexed gels of
nickel (Cs–Ni), cobalt (Cs–Co), chromium (Cs–Cr),
and palladium (Cs–Pd) were washed thoroughly with Milli-Q water,
dried at 70 °C for 24 h, and powdered in a mortar and pestle.
Powdered materials were further characterized by energy-dispersive
spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy (EDS-FESEM,
Gemini, Ultra55), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance), and
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, PerkinElmer) to confirm
chelation of metal ions to Cs matrix. A 10 nm gold film was sputtered
onto to the sample and examined by EDS-FESEM at an electron accelerating
potential of 10 KeV. X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded from
10 to 30° with a scanning speed of 1.2° min–1 using Cu Kα radiation. The FTIR spectra were recorded in UATR
mode in the range of 400–650 cm–1.

4.4 Ex Vivo Permeation Studies
Percutaneous
absorption of nickel ions on pig skin was evaluated using Franz static
diffusion cell. The pig skin was obtained from local abattoir and
treated within 1 h after sacrifice. Subcutaneous fat was removed by
surgical blades, and the skin was cut into 2 × 2 cm2 sections. Franz static diffusion cell (15 mm diameter, Anton Scientific)
was washed with aqua regia and Milli-Q water before performing diffusion
experiments. The donor chamber of Franz diffusion cell was filled
with 2 mL of 0.05 M NiSO4 salt solution, and the receiver
chamber with Milli-Q water throughout the experiments. To test the
efficacy of chitosan–glycerol gel as barrier formulation, 1
g of the chitosan–glycerol gel was spread on the skin just
before the diffusion experiment was performed. All diffusion cell
experiments were done for 48 h, after which the skin was removed and
washed thoroughly with Milli-Q water to remove unbound nickel ion
and/or residual gel. Skin membranes were later digested using 10 mL
of concentrated nitric acid and 2 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide under
agitation for 12 h. The solution was heated at boiling point to vaporize
all of the liquids. The solid residue obtained was redissolved in
2% nitric acid and analyzed by ICP-MS. Untreated pig skin and pig
tissues with 500 μL of glycerol served as controls throughout
the diffusion experiments.
