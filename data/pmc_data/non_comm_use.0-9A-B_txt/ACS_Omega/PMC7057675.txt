We report on a high-brightness
ultraviolet (UV) nanoscale light
source. The light emission diodes are constructed with graphene/ZnO
nanowire/p-GaN vertical junctions, which exhibit strong UV electroluminescence
(EL) emissions centered at a wavelength of 397 nm at one end of the
ZnO nanowire. Compared to the horizontal heterojunction, the vertical
junction based on the ZnO nanowire increases the interface area of
the heterojunction along with a high-quality interface, thus making
the device robust under a large excitation current. In this structure,
transparent flexible graphene is used as the top electrode, which
can effectively improve performance by increasing the carrier injection
area. Moreover, by analyzing the relationship between the integrated
light intensity and applied bias, a superlinear dependency with a
slope of 3.99 is observed, which means high electrical-to-optical
conversion efficiency. Three electron–hole irradiation recombination
processes are distinguished according to the EL emission spectra.

1 Introduction
Increasing
demands for ever-increasing speed and functionalities
of the communication networks call for scaling down of devices. Nanoscale
light sources are promising for photonic and electronic devices, such
as seamless on-chip integration of photonics and electronics, ultrahigh-resolution
biomedical diagnostics, and unprecedented-capacity information storage.1 Semiconductor heterojunctions based on one-dimensional
(1D) nanostructures and p-type substrates are an ideal choice for
the high-performance nanoscale light source.2−4

ZnO has
attracted considerable attention for ultraviolet (UV) light
emitters because of their bandgap of 3.37 eV and exciton binding energy
of 60 meV.5−7 One-dimensional ZnO micro- and nanostructures with
good crystallinity, smooth boundaries, and excellent waveguiding properties
can be used as natural waveguides and resonant microcavities.8 However, it is still a challenge to obtain high-quality
p-type ZnO materials. Alternatively, high-quality p-GaN offers an
excellent platform to construct the p–n junction with n-ZnO.9−12

ZnO nanowires/p-GaN heterojunctions have sparked considerable
interest
for nanoscale solid-state light emitters.13,14 In the previous work, by simply placing ZnO nanowires on p-GaN thin
films with a Pt contact at one end of the nanowire, we obtain UV light.
In this structure, electrons could be injected from the small section
of the nanowire, and the current injection area is restricted by the
diameter of the nanowire.15 In the single-nanowire
electrically driven laser based on the n-CdS nanowire/p-Si heterojunction,
electrons can be injected into the CdS nanowire.16 A vertical injection structure based on ZnO-microrod/p-GaN
has been reported by Dai et al., who have realized the electrically
pumped Whispering-Gallery-Mode lasing.17 Among these structures, increasing the carrier injection efficiency
is crucial.

Graphene has attracted great research interest recently
because
of its unique properties of high mobility (as high as 26,000 cm2 V–1 s–1 at RT)18 and conductivity (sheet resistance of 200 Ω
per square),19 low optical absorption rate
of 2.3%,20 high chemical stability, as
well as high mechanical elasticity (elastic modulus of about 1 TPa).21 In contrast to opaque metal electrodes and indium
tin oxide electrodes,22 graphene sheets,
with extremely high optical transparency, good conductivity, and simple
damage-free fabrication, are suitable for applications in the fields
of nanoelectronics as transparent window materials and high-quality
electrodes.23−25

In this work, we report on a nanoscale light
source based on the
graphene/ZnO nanowires/p-GaN vertical junction. In this structure,
we used a vertical junction and transparent flexible graphene electrodes,
which can enfold the upper surface of the ZnO nanowire and increase
the carrier injection area. Moreover, it is found that the ZnO nanowire-based
light emitters exhibit stronger UV electroluminescence (EL) emission
of 397 nm at one end of the ZnO nanowire. This work provides a route
for developing a high-brightness UV nanoscale light source on the
basis of ZnO nanowires.

2 Result and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a typical ZnO nanowire
grown by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. A perfect hexagonal
cross-section and smooth side facets are observed, which means that
the ZnO nanowire is of high quality and can act as an optical waveguide. Figure 1b shows the optical
image of one typical device of the fabricated n-type ZnO nanowire/p-type
GaN film heterojunction with good contact. The detailed device structure
and the external test circuit are schematically illustrated in Figure 1c. In this device,
carriers can be injected into the ZnO nanowire from the top graphene
electrode and the bottom p-GaN film, respectively. By using flexible
graphene as an electrode which can enfold the upper surface higher
than the Al2O3 film of the ZnO nanowire, we
can effectively increase the carrier injection area.

ZnO nanowire with perfect hexagonal
cross-section and smooth surfaces as an optical waveguide; (b) optical
image of the fabricated n-type ZnO nanowire/p-type GaN film heterojunction;
(c) schematic of the basic structure of the graphene/ZnO nanowire/p-GaN
vertical junction and the test circuit.

As the devices are applied with proper forward bias, a very bright
emitting light can be observed directly by naked eyes. Figure 2a–f shows optical images
of the EL spot of the n-ZnO nanowire/p-GaN heterostructure device
under different forward biases from 0 to 200 V. The good performance
of the light source implies that the assembling procedure of a simple
direct contact between ZnO nanowire and p-GaN film is effective to
produce the interface of the ZnO nanowire and p-GaN for a high-quality
p–n heterojunction. As the forward bias increases, more and
more intense blue-violet emissions can be seen from the graphene/n-ZnO
nanowire/p-GaN heterojunction area, which is also the carrier vertical
injection area, as denoted by the yellow arrow in Figure 2c. A blue-violet emission can
also be seen at the end of the ZnO nanowire, which implies the ZnO
nanowire can serve as an optical waveguide and the end of the ZnO
nanowire can serve as a nanoscale light source, as denoted by the
red arrow. If the ZnO nanowire is damaged due to being pressed with
a glass needle tip at certain point, a blue-violet emission can also
be seen from this pressed point, as denoted by the green arrow.

device at different forward biases of (a) 0 V, (b) 30 V, (c) 50 V,
(d) 100 V, (e) 150 V, and (f) 200 V. The area of the graphene/n-ZnO
nanowire/p-GaN heterojunction, the terminal area of the ZnO nanowire,
and the damage area of ZnO nanowire pressed with glass needle tip
are pointed by yellow, red, and green arrows in (c), respectively.

Figure 3a shows
the EL spectrum of the n-ZnO nanowire/p-GaN heterostructure device
at room temperature obtained from the body of the nanowire enfolded
by graphene at different forward biases. The EL spectrum shows a broad
near-UV emission peak centered at ∼400 nm with the forward
bias from 20 to 100 V, and the emission band extends unsymmetrically
to 470 nm. Through Gaussian deconvolution analysis, the broad emission
is decomposed into three distinct emissions, as shown in Figure 3b, which correspond
to three different optoelectronic processes. To further confirm the
physical origin of the EL emission, measurement of the selected area
of photoluminescence (PL) under an incident laser of 325 nm was carried
out, as illustrated in Figure S1a in the
Supporting Information, with the illumination area given in the inset.
The energy barriers at the n-ZnO/p-GaN junction interface are formed.
The three recombination processes considering the interfacial barriers
are illustrated in the energy band diagram, as shown in Figure 3c. According to the analysis
of the interfacial energy band renormalization and the emission spectrum,
the barrier of 0.35 eV for electrons and 0.33 eV for holes are extracted.
Therefore, the EL is from the n-ZnO, p-GaN, and the interfaces of
the graphene/ZnO/GaN vertical junction.

graphene/n-ZnO/p-GaN vertical junctions
under different forward biases from 20 to 100 V. Inset: the spectrum

100 V; (c) schematic of energy band diagram of the n-ZnO nanowire/p-GaN
heterojunction with the corresponding three recombination processes
illustrated; and (d) the relationship between the integrated EL emission
intensity and the applied bias voltage.

A representative broad EL spectrum obtained from the body of the
nanowire at 100 V is decomposed by multipeaks Gaussian fitting referring
to the PL spectrum. Each spectrum includes three distinct subbands
centered at ∼393, 411, and 438 nm, respectively, as shown in Figure 3b. Compared with
the PL spectrum in Figure S1a, the UV emission
band at 393 nm is from the near-band-edge (NBE) recombination in the
ZnO nanowire, while the blue emission band at 438 nm is from recombination
between the electrons in the conduction band and the deep Mg acceptor
level in the p-GaN thin film. The emission band at 411 nm can be attributed
to the radiative interface recombination of electrons from n-ZnO nanowires
and holes from p-GaN films. As a result, the wide EL emission band
is attributed to the superposition of a strong ZnO NBE recombination,
a relatively weak interfacial radiation, and a very weak emission
from the p-GaN film. As the applied voltage increases, the focus of
the EL spectrum profile shifts to the UV direction. It is suggested
that light emitting will concentrate more in the ZnO nanowire with
the increasing applied biases, which is originated from the recombination
of excitons in ZnO.

Figure 3d shows
the relationship between the integrated intensity (L) of the EL peak and the applied biases (V). The
results are fitted well by the power law of L ∝ Vm, where m accounts for the influence of nonradiative defects on the light
emission characteristics.26 The L–V curve in Figure 3d shows a superlinear dependency at a low
voltage (<50 V) with m = 3.99 and then sublinear
dependency at a high voltage (>50 V) with m =
0.56.
In the previous work by Alivov and co-workers, the light–current
(L–I) characteristics of
the n-ZnO/p-GaN film junction show a similar superlinear dependency
for low currents (<10 mA) with m = 1.9, which
changes to a sublinear (m = 0.85) dependency for
higher currents (>10 mA).11 Experimental
investigation by Uji et al. on InGaAsP/lnP LEDs has demonstrated that
nonradiative recombination influenced strongly by the injected carrier
density is responsible for the output saturation.27 The turning point in the L–V curve corresponds to the voltage value, where the nonradiative
recombination is saturated and the energy conversion efficiency reaches
a maximum. In the L–V curve
fitted by the power law of L ∝ Vm, a superlinear phenomenon (m = 3.99) at low voltages suggests that the increased rate
of radiative recombination is much quicker than that of nonradiative
recombination. The sublinear dependency (m = 0.56)
under high voltages is due to the saturation in nonradiative recombination
and the decrease in electrical-to-optical conversion efficiency caused
by Auger recombination or by Joule heating effects.28

EL spectrum of the device at one end of the ZnO nanowire
at different
forward biases from 10 to 40 V is presented in Figure 4a. The profile of the EL spectrum does not
change much with applied biases. The mechanism of EL can be interpreted
by the same energy band diagram shown in Figure 3c, and a representative broad EL spectrum
obtained from one end of the ZnO nanowire at 40 V is also decomposed
with Gaussian functions referring to the PL spectrum. The superposition
of a strong interface radiation (408 nm), a relatively weak ZnO NBE
recombination (395 nm), and a very weak emission from p-GaN film (432
nm) were obtained, as shown in Figure 4b.

Figure 4 (a) EL spectrum at one end of the ZnO nanowire at different
forward
biases from 0 to 40 V. Inset: the spectrum collection area denoted
by the red arrow; (b) Gaussian fitting of three distinct subbands
in a representative EL spectrum at 40 V; (c) finite-difference time-domain
(FDTD)-simulated field distribution of four modes; and (d) relationship
between field amplitude of four modes and propagation length.

As we have seen in the experiment result, the ZnO
nanowire in the
light emitters appears to support the guide modes that propagate along
the c-axis though much of light leaked to the GaN
substrate because of its larger refractive index. The possible field
distribution of the guide modes and propagation loss are studied by
FDTD simulation. The degenerated HEmn modes splitting as
the nanowire is on a substrate with refractive index larger than air.
The two possibilities are labeled as HEmna and HEmnb. We find some lowest-order modes which have relatively less loss
comparing to the others though no stable-guided mode exists in the
ZnO nanowire/p-GaN structure. The field distribution of four modes
of them is shown in Figure 4c. The field amplitude versus propagation length are plotted,
as shown in Figure 4d. TM01 mode has the smallest propagation loss of about
0.090 dB/μm or 3.6 dB for the 40 μm length. The propagation
loss of HE11a, HE11b, and HE21b are
0.22, 0.17, and 0.18 dB/μm, respectively. These four modes have
relatively stable field distribution in tens of micrometers. Field
energy of TE01 and HE21a modes are quickly absorbed
by the GaN substrate in several micrometers whose mode patterns will
not be maintained in the nanowire. The other higher-order modes have
more propagation loss.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
the graphene/ZnO nanowire/p-GaN vertical junction
light sources have been demonstrated. Each individual device acts
as a high-performance nanoscale UV light source driven by a bias voltage.
The investigation of PL and EL spectra indicates that the emission
band has three distinct electron–hole recombination processes:
a strong UV emission band centered at around 393 nm from the NBE emission
in the ZnO nanowire, a relatively weak radiative recombination at
the n-ZnO/p-GaN interface, and a very weak emission from the p-GaN
film. This work reveals the physical mechanism and light output process
of near-violet EL in the vertical graphene/ZnO nanowire/p-GaN thin
film junction, and the demonstrated high-performance nanoscale light
source should be useful for the future optoelectronic integration
technology.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis
of ZnO Nanowires
ZnO nanowires
were synthesized by a simple CVD method in a horizontal quartz tube
furnace. Uniform mixture of high pure carbon powder and analytical
pure ZnO powder (the atomic ratio of C and O is 1:1) were used as
the zinc source. Mixed gases of Ar and O2 with 100 and
3.0 sccm, respectively, served as a carrier gas and an oxygen source.
The temperature was held at 1070 °C for 120 min and cooled step
by step with an interval of 200 °C for 60 min.

4.2 Synthesis of p-Type GaN Film
Mg-doped
p-GaN film was grown by metal–organic CVD. An intrinsic GaN
layer (2 μm) was first grown on a (0001) c-face
sapphire substrate. Then, Mg-doped GaN layer (1.75 μm) was grown
on the GaN buffer layer. The Mg-doped GaN layer was annealed at 750
°C in a nitrogen atmosphere for 20 min.

4.3 Device
Fabrication
The Mg-doped p-GaN
thin films were grown on c-plane sapphire substrates.
First, Ni (10 nm)/Au (50 nm) electrodes were evaporated on p-GaN,
followed by annealing at 500 °C for 5 min in an O2 atmosphere to form an Ohmic contact. The 100 nm thick Al2O3 insulator layer was evaporated on the p-GaN surface
through electron beam evaporation. Then, a series of 1–5 μm
wide grooves exposing p-GaN were formed using the standard electron
beam lithography technique. The CVD-grown high quality ZnO nanowire
was transferred from the as-grown substrate using the glass fiber
under an optical microscope and placed along the groove to form the
n-ZnO nanowire/p-GaN heterostructure. The evaporated Au micro-stamp
and the CVD-grown monolayer graphene micro-stamp were transferred
using site-specific transfer-printing technique with poly(methyl methacrylate)
as a carrier film.29,30 The graphene micro-stamp covered
the ZnO nanowire as the top electrode, and covered part of the Au
micro-stamp on the Al2O3 insulator layer to
connect the external circuit. Thus, part of the graphene contacted
directly with the ZnO nanowire, and another part of the graphene contacted
with the Au electrode on Al2O3. Because the
diameter of the ZnO nanowire was larger than the thickness of the
Al2O3, the flexible graphene was supported by
the ZnO nanowire and did not contact with the exposed p-GaN.

4.4 Characterization and Measurements
The PL spectra were
measured by a microzone confocal spectroscope
(Renishaw inVia microRaman system) using a He–Cd laser (325
nm in wavelength). The EL measurements were also carried out by the
same Renishaw optical system with a 20× optical microscope objective.
The EL spectrum was collected vertically to the junction region of
p-GaN and ZnO nanowires covered with transparent graphene electrodes,
and the electric power was supplied by an Agilent B2912A Precision
Source/Measure Unit. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the junction were
measured by a Keithley-4200 semiconductor parameter analyzer. All
measurements were carried out at room temperature. The forward biases
with positive voltage were applied on the p-GaN.
