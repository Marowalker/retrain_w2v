The
adsorption ability of chitosan (CS) usually decreases with
the introduction of magnetic particles, and thus magnetic CS has to
be chemically modified further to improve its adsorption performance.
Herein, a novel magnetic chitosan composite (Fe3O4–CS3) with porous structure and evenly distributed Fe3O4 was successfully prepared via the reduction
of the solubility of CS by ethanol (physical reaction), and followed
the coprecipitation of the mixture of FeCl3/FeCl2/CS by ethanol/NH3·H2O. Without any modification,
its maximum adsorption capacity toward Cr(VI) ions can achieve 242.1
mg/g (≈468.6 mg/g of CS). This significant progress could be
ascribed to the very fast precipitate rate of CS due to the decrease
in solubility induced by ethanol. Ethanol causes rigorous solidification
of CS, so that there is not enough time to densify, resulting in a
looser CS matrix with a larger pore size. After adsorption, this Fe3O4–CS3 could not only be easily separated
but also be effectively regenerated by NaOH solution in a rather wider
concentration range, showing great potential in the field of heavy
metal wastewater treatment.

1 Introduction
Magnetic
chitosan (CS) composite has been extensively investigated
for adsorbing heavy metal ions because of its characteristic of easy
magnetic separation,1−4 and the controllable modification of CS via the free amino and hydroxyl
groups for highly efficient removal.5,6 Its most used
preparation procedure is first to obtain the magnetic micro/nanoparticles,
followed by CS blending (labeled as method I).7,8 Meanwhile,
a few explorations appear in preparing magnetic CS by a simple one-step
method, which includes coprecipitating FeCl3/FeCl2/CS solution by alkali (labeled as method II).9,10 For
example, after adding a small amount of CS powder to FeCl3/FeCl2 mixture at 50 °C, alkali precipitation was
carried out once the aqueous ammonia was dripped, resulting in CS-coated
Fe3O4 nanoparticles.11 It seems that different ways of introducing magnetic particles to
CS influence the dispersion situation of the composites, as well as
their adsorption performance. Especially, if CS is in excess in method
I, the magnetic particles are inclined to aggregate or remain on the
surface of CS.12,13 Yu et al.14 added Fe3O4 nanoparticles into the
CS/FeCl3 solution to synthesize magnetic CS–Fe(III)
complex; its scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows that the
Fe3O4 spheres are anchored on the surface of
the CS–Fe(III) resins with high density. This is the main reason
why magnetic CS prepared by method I usually exhibits poor adsorption
capacity, and thus various chemical modifications were conducted to
improve its performance.15,16 On the other hand,
magnetic CS prepared by coprecipitation seems to show a better adsorption
capacity toward heavy metal ions. For method II, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles are relatively uniformly dispersed in
the continuous CS phase. For example, the maximum adsorption capacity
of Fe3O4–CS prepared by a facile one-step
method can reach 63.5 mg/g toward Cu(II).17 Although in the peer literatures based on method I, the maximum
adsorption capacities of CS-bound Fe3O4 nanoparticles18 and xanthate-modified magnetic CS19 are 21.5 and 34.5 mg/g toward Cu(II), respectively.
Unfortunately, there is no specialized research on the effects of
the introduction ways on the adsorption performance of CS toward heavy
metal ions in one single study.

Both for methods I and II, CS
should be dissolved in an acid solution
for the following blend with magnetic particles.20,21 In this step, the amino (−NH2) of CS is protonated
into −NH3+. To finally obtain solid-state
products, a CS-precipitated process, which could be divided into three
types based on the precipitation mechanism, is involved: cross-linking
reaction induced by cross-linker,22,23 deprotonation
of −NH3+ induced by alkali,24,25 and solubility decrease induced by alcohol.26,27 Among them, the former two are induced by chemical reactions, whereas
the latter is attributed to the physical reaction, which is common
in the fabrication of CS–metal ion complexes (such as CS–Fe(III)).28,29 Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate the effects
of the precipitation types on the adsorption performance of CS.

To the best of knowledge, there is no report on preparing magnetic
CS with alcohol. Herein, we report a facile in situ method to prepare
a magnetic CS composite (Fe3O4–CS3) with
enhanced adsorption performance toward Cr(VI) ions via coprecipitating
FeCl3/FeCl2/CS mixture by ethanol/NH3·H2O. The Fe3O4–CS3
shows better performance than that obtained by mixing pre-prepared
Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and than that precipitated
by NH3·H2O alone, respectively. This Fe3O4–CS3 can not only be easily separated
after adsorption, but also be effectively regenerated by NaOH solution
in a rather wider concentration range, showing a great potential in
the field of heavy metal wastewater treatment.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structure and Morphology
The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of Fe3O4–CS1, Fe3O4–CS2, Fe3O4–CS3, and pure
CS in Figure S1 show that CS was successfully
bounded with well-crystallized Fe3O4 in each
case. The SEM images of Fe3O4–CS1, Fe3O4–CS2, and Fe3O4–CS3
in Figure 1 show that
all of them present irregular microparticles. Comparatively, the particles
size of Fe3O4–CS3 around 10 μm
is much greater than that of Fe3O4–CS1
around 1 μm and that of Fe3O4–CS2
around 2 μm, respectively. Furthermore, Figure 1a2–c2 shows that Fe3O4–CS1 and Fe3O4–CS2 look
like dense microparticles, whereas Fe3O4–CS3
consists of loose, porous blocks with many fragments. This phenomenon
may result from the difference in the speed of precipitating CS among
glutaraldehyde (GLA), NH3·H2O, and ethanol.
From the point view of precipitation mechanism, cross-linking reaction
induced by glutaraldehyde and deprotonation of −NH3+ induced by NH3·H2O are chemical
changes, which require much energy to maintain. However, after adding
ethanol, the CS solubility decreases and simultaneously precipitates
because CS is insoluble in ethanol, and this physical precipitation
is much easier and faster than that of the other two precipitation
processes. This theoretical analysis agrees well with the experimental
observations: flocculent precipitate slowly developed in the case
of glutaraldehyde or NH3·H2O, whereas transparent
gel quickly filled the whole beaker once the ethanol was added. Fast
precipitate rate causes too hurried solidification of CS so that there
is not enough time to densify, resulting in loose, porous blocks with
large size, just like Fe3O4–CS3. Similarly,
CS–Fe(III) complexes precipitated by ethanol usually have many
cracks.14

of (a) Fe3O4–CS1, (b) Fe3O4–CS2, and
(c) Fe3O4–CS3, as well as the corresponding
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping of Fe
and N.

Furthermore, elemental mapping
of microstructures by SEM with energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was shown in Figure 1a3–c3 for element Fe (characteristic
element of Fe3O4) and Figure 1a4–c4 for element N (characteristic
element of CS). The presence of Fe and N further confirms the successful
preparation of Fe3O4–CS. However, the
uniform distribution of the elements in micronscale could not precisely
characterize the disperse state on the nanoscale. Their high-magnification
SEM images are shown in Figure 1a5–c5. The surface of Fe3O4–CS1
in Figure 1a5 is rough
and some tiny particles with diameters of about 15 nm (in circle 2#)
could be discernible on it, just like the particles scattered out
of the CS phase (in circle 1#). The literature also indicates that
if CS is in excess, the added magnetic particles are inclined to aggregate
or remain on the surface of CS.13,14 However, the surface
of Fe3O4–CS2 in Figure 1b5 is relatively smooth without extensive
attachments. Figure 1c5 clearly confirms that Fe3O4–CS3 consists
of loose, porous blocks with many tiny fragments.

Transmission
electron microscope (TEM) images in Figure 2 further clarify the distribution
of Fe3O4 in CS. Figure 2a shows that the well-defined Fe3O4 nanoparticles (∼15 nm) in Fe3O4–CS1 slightly aggregate, resulting in a nonuniform
dispersion. The high contrast ratio between Fe3O4 nanoparticles and CS matrix implicitly proves that Fe3O4 nanoparticles anchor on the surface of CS, indicating
that the particles in red circles (Figure 1a5) are Fe3O4. By comparison,
Fe3O4 nanoparticles in Fe3O4–CS2 and Fe3O4–CS3 uniformly
disperse without an obvious color difference. Furthermore, for samples
obtained from the two coprecipitation processes in Figure 2b,c, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles show irregularly shaped nanoparticles, just
like tiny fragments embedded in CS. The sizes of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in the two cases are both around 10 nm, which
is consistent with the calculation based on the Scherrer equation
(see the Supporting Information). The similar
TEM images of Fe3O4–CS2 and Fe3O4–CS3 show that addition of ethanol does not change
the distribution of Fe3O4 in CS.

magnifications of (a) Fe3O4–CS1, (b)

2.2 Formation Mechanism
As shown in Figure 3, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared by coprecipitating FeCl3/FeCl2 in the presence of ammonia as follows30 1   2   3   4  Then, after blending Fe3O4 with the CS solution, the mixture was cross-linked by Schiff’s
reaction between aldehyde group of glutaraldehyde (denoted as r-CHO)
with amine group of CS (denoted as R-NH2), resulting in
insoluble polymers31 5  Thus, Fe3O4–CS1
yielded. Different from injecting the Fe3O4 nanoparticles
to the acid CS solution directly, Fe3O4 nanoparticles
in Fe3O4–CS2 and Fe3O4–CS3 arose in situ. Before the formation of Fe3O4 in FeCl3/FeCl2/CS solution,
Fe3+ ions would first form a complex with the hydroxyl
group (−OH) of protonated CS via chelate bond, as shown in Figure 3b,c. In other words,
Fe3+ ions are uniformly fixed on the CS, and this limits
their mobility. Therefore, once Fe2+ and NH3·H2O were successively added, Fe3O4 nanoparticles in smaller size uniformly emerged, just following 1–4. At the same time,
the soluble protonated CS (denoted as R-NH3+) was deprotonated into insoluble CS (R-NH2) by NH3·H2O 6  Based on the two simultaneous processes, Fe3O4 nanoparticles uniformly embed into CS composite
(Figure 3b), resulting
in Fe3O4–CS2. While for the precipitants
of ethanol/NH3·H2O containing ethanol which is much easier and faster than
that of NH3·H2O to precipitate the aqueous
CS, ethanol dominates the precipitation process of CS by decreasing
its solubility seriously. Fast precipitate rate causes rigorous solidification
of CS, so that there is not enough time for Fe3O4–CS3 to densify, resulting in loose, porous blocks with large
size (Figure 3c). Meanwhile,
Fe3O4 nanoparticles arose by coprecipitation,
and protonated CS was deprotonated by NH3·H2O.

2.3 Adsorption Performance
2.3.1 Effects
of pH
The pH dependence
of adsorbing Cr(VI) is largely connected with the surface charge of
the adsorbent and the speciation of Cr(VI) ions. Effects of pH value
on the ζ-potentials of the samples are shown in Figure 4a. It is clear that, as the
pH increases, their surface potentials turn from positive charge to
negative charge at the isoelectric points (pHZPC). When
the pH < pHZPC, the amino group of Fe3O4–CS was protonated into −NH3+, making its surface electropositive. With increasing pH,
−NH3+ of Fe3O4–CS
would be gradually deprotonated, even negatively charged at pH >
pHZPC. The pHZPC of Fe3O4–CS2
and Fe3O4–CS3 are 9.74 and 9.08, respectively,
which are much higher than 5.01 of Fe3O4–CS1.
This could be attributed to the fact that the surface of Fe3O4–CS1 is seriously covered by Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which carry numerous electronegative hydroxyl
groups, resulting in low pHZPC. The high pHZPC of Fe3O4–CS2 and Fe3O4–CS3 can yield a stronger electrostatic attraction
between the adsorbents and the Cr(VI) anions, and thus their Cr(VI)
uptake efficiencies increase.

Figure 4 (a) ζ-Potential curves of Fe3O4–CS
at different pH, (b) effect of the initial pH on the adsorption of
Cr(VI) by Fe3O4–CS (adsorption conditions: C0 = 100 mg/L, V = 25 mL, m = 25 mg, t = 4 h, T =
25 °C), (c) FT-IR curves of Fe3O4–CS
before and after Cr(VI) adsorption, (d) vibrating sample magnetometer
(VSM) magnetization curves of Fe3O4–CS
(inset shows the photos of the adsorption system before and after
adsorption attracted by an external magnet).

Cr(VI) exists in various forms such as H2CrO4, HCrO4–, and CrO42–, depending on the pH.32 When the pH <
2, H2CrO4 and HCrO4– coexist; when the pH is between 2 and 4, primarily HCrO4– exists; at a higher pH, CrO42– appears and increases gradually; and when the pH > 9, HCrO4– disappears, leaving only CrO42–. Thus, the negatively charged Cr(VI) ions have
a
strong interaction with the positively charged adsorbents. The effect
of the initial pH on the Cr(VI) adsorption of Fe3O4–CS is shown in Figure 4b. It is obvious that with increasing pH, the adsorption
capacities of the three samples all decrease notably. Therefore, pH
= 2 was chosen as the optimum pH for the following experiments.

2.3.2 Adsorption Mechanism
The highly
pH-dependent adsorption process is mainly based on the electrostatic
attraction between HCrO4– and −NH3+ on the surface of Fe3O4–CS. To further elucidate the effect of functional groups
on the adsorption mechanism,33 the surface
interaction involved in the adsorption process was characterized by
FT-IR, as shown in Figure 4c and Table S2. Taking Fe3O4–CS2 as an example, its FT-IR after adsorption
exhibits a significant shift from 3447.7 to 3432.3 and 1633.5 to 1628.4
cm–1, whereas other peaks shift slightly. This reveals
that the amino groups may participate in the Cr(VI) removal process.
As mentioned earlier, the −NH2 on the surface of
Fe3O4–CS are easily protonated to a positively
charged −NH3+ under acidic condition
and favorable for anion adsorption through electrostatic interaction.
Another obvious feature after adsorption is that a new peak appears
at ∼940 cm–1, which is the characteristic
peak of Cr(VI)–O,34 indicating that
the adsorption process on Fe3O4–CS (R-NH2) is as follows35 7   8  

2.3.3 Magnetic Separation
The magnetization
curves of Fe3O4–CS1, Fe3O4–CS2, and Fe3O4–CS3 are
shown in Figure 4d.
Their corresponding saturation magnetizations are 51.48, 28.5, and
11.8 emu/g, respectively. Because of the nonmagnetic CS, its content
in Fe3O4–CS as well as the combination
between CS and Fe3O4 impacts the magnetic moment.
For Fe3O4–CS1, its CS content of 37.06%
(see Figure S2) is lower than 42.91% for
Fe3O4–CS2 and 51.66% for Fe3O4–CS3, and the Fe3O4 nanoparticles
are anchored on the surface of CS, resulting in the highest saturation
magnetization. However, compared with Fe3O4–CS2,
the agglomerate size of Fe3O4–CS3 is
much larger, and the porous structure further quenches the magnetic
moment, resulting in the lowest saturation magnetization. Even so,
the magnetic moment of Fe3O4–CS3 is large
enough for magnetic separation (see the inset of Figure 4d). The particles of Cr(VI)-loaded
Fe3O4–CS3 can be quickly separated within
30 s by the permanent magnet, and the solution became limpid accordingly.

2.3.4 Adsorption Kinetics
Adsorption
of Cr(VI) on Fe3O4–CS as a function of
the contact time is presented in Figure 5a. For the three adsorbents, the very fast
Cr(VI) adsorption at the initial stage (0–30 min) implies an
external surface diffusion; during the second period (0.5–1
h), the Cr(VI) adsorption is milder and more gradual, whereas the
last stage (1–8 h) is the equilibrium state. Furthermore, Fe3O4–CS2 requires a rather shorter time to
reach the adsorption equilibrium (within 1 h).

Figure 5 Adsorption kinetics (a),
the corresponding pseudo-first-order model
(b), pseudo-second-order model (c), and intraparticle diffusion model
(d) of Fe3O4–CS1, Fe3O4–CS2, and Fe3O4–CS3 (reaction
conditions: C0 = 100 mg/L, V = 100 mL, m = 100 mg, T = 25 °C).

To investigate the controlling
mechanism of the adsorption process,
the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models (see the Supporting Information) were used to assess the
data.36 The plots of the kinetic models
are shown in Figure 5b,c, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table S3. Because of the higher correlation coefficients (R2) and the closer values between qe and qe,exp, the adsorption
data fit the pseudo-second-order model better than those of the pseudo-first-order
model, indicating that the adsorption of Cr(VI) onto each Fe3O4–CS may be controlled by chemical adsorption.
Furthermore, in comparison with Fe3O4–CS1
and Fe3O4–CS3, the value of k2 for Fe3O4–CS2 shows faster
adsorption kinetics, which is consistent with the result of adsorption
equilibrium time.

To investigate whether surface or pore diffusion
is the controlling
step in the adsorption process or not, intraparticle diffusion model
(see the Supporting Information) was used.22 Three linear portions in the plots of qt vs t1/2 (Figure 5d) indicates that
the adsorption of Cr(VI) on Fe3O4–CS
occurs via three steps. As shown in Table S4, the intraparticle diffusion rate constant in each case follows
the same order: kid,1 > kid,2 > kid,3. The rate-limiting
steps could be described as follows: (1) the first sharp portion corresponded
to the surface diffusion stage, in which a large amount of Cr(VI)
ions from the bulk solution are quickly adsorbed onto the surface
protonated amino groups of Fe3O4–CS;
(2) when the surface active sites are completely occupied, the Cr(VI)
gradually enters the interior surface of the pores in the second stage,
in which the intraparticle diffusion (pore diffusion) is the rate-controlling
step; and (3) the intraparticle diffusion rate of the third portion
is almost zero, suggesting that the final equilibrium stage is reached.
As shown in Table S4, kid,1 and kid,2 of Fe3O4–CS3 are much higher than those of Fe3O4–CS1 and Fe3O4–CS2,
indicating that Cr(VI) adsorption on Fe3O4–CS3
is the fastest. Especially, kid,2 of Fe3O4–CS1, Fe3O4–CS2,
and Fe3O4–CS3 are 0.625, 0.743, and 1.596
mg/(g min)1/2, respectively, which are closely related
to intraparticle diffusion. However, it is Fe3O4–CS3 that spends the most time to reach its adsorption equilibrium.
On the one hand, the more Cr(VI) ions the adsorbent adsorbs, the more
time it takes. On the other hand, due to the biggest average pore
size of 10.03 nm and the largest pore volume of 0.04 cm3/g of Fe3O4–CS3, its adsorption toward
Cr(VI) ions greatly involves in pore diffusion (with high kid,2) and takes more time for Cr(VI) ions to
reach its pore surface.

2.3.5 Adsorption Isotherms
Their adsorption
isotherms at 25 °C are depicted in Figure 6a. With the increasing concentration of Cr(VI),
their adsorption capacities rise sharply and then tend to be saturated.
Obviously, Fe3O4–CS2 shows a much higher
adsorption capacity (152.5 mg/g) than Fe3O4–CS1
(82.1 mg/g). More interestingly, the adsorption performance of Fe3O4–CS2 could be significantly enhanced via
precipitating FeCl3/FeCl2/CS mixture by ethanol/NH3·H2O (i.e., the adsorption capacity of Fe3O4–CS3 can reach 235.4 mg/g). Langmuir and
Freundlich models (see the Supporting Information) were used to simulate the data,37 as
shown in Figure 6b,c,
respectively.

Figure 6 Adsorption isotherms (a), the corresponding Langmuir model
(b),
and Freundlich model (c) of Fe3O4–CS1,
Fe3O4–CS2, and Fe3O4–CS3 (adsorption conditions: C0 = 50–1000 mg/L, V = 25 mL, m = 25 mg, t = 4 h, T = 25 °C).

Langmuir model assumes that a
monomolecular layer is formed when
adsorption takes place without any interaction between the adsorbed
molecules.38 However, Freundlich isotherm
is an empirical equation that assumes that the adsorption process
takes place on heterogeneous surfaces or surfaces containing sites
of varied affinities.39 Their parameters
calculated from the models are listed in Table S5. It shows that the Langmuir isotherm fits better to the
data with all R2 > 0.98, indicating
that
the Cr(VI) adsorption of each sample is a monolayer adsorption. The
maximum adsorption capacities of Fe3O4–CS1,
Fe3O4–CS2, and Fe3O4–CS3 are 97.9, 156.2, and 242.1 mg/g, respectively. Compared
with CS, which contains numerous free −NH2 and −OH
groups, the contribution of Fe3O4 in the adsorbtion
of Cr(VI) is negligible. Considering that the CS contents (see Figure S2) in Fe3O4–CS1,
Fe3O4–CS2, and Fe3O4–CS3 are 37.06, 42.91, and 51.66%, respectively, it is of
great significance to describe their adsorption performance by calculating
the equivalent adsorption capacity of CS singly, which turns to be
264.16, 364.01, and 468.64 mg/g, respectively. In other words, the
CS in Fe3O4–CS3 shows the most efficient
adsorption toward Cr(VI). It is generally recognized that the greater
the surface area, the larger the saturated adsorption amount. Herein,
their Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas (see Table S1) from high to low are 47.7 m2/g (Fe3O4–CS1) > 32.4 m2/g
(Fe3O4–CS2) > 17.3 m2/g
(Fe3O4–CS3). However, their adsorption
capacities
follow the reverse order of the BET surface area. This anomaly may
result from their construction features. During the process of injecting
the Fe3O4 nanoparticles to the CS solution,
the tiny particles were inclined to anchor on the surface of Fe3O4–CS1, resulting in a high surface area
but leaving the valuable CS surface seriously covered. However, for
Fe3O4–CS2 prepared from coprecipitating
the FeCl3/FeCl2/CS mixture by NH3·H2O, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles
were uniformly dispersed in the continuous CS phase, making more CS
participate in the electrostatic adsorption reaction. This is the
reason why Fe3O4–CS2 shows a much better
adsorption performance than Fe3O4–CS1.
On the other hand, compared with Fe3O4–CS2,
the adsorption capacity of Fe3O4–CS3
was significantly enhanced via precipitating FeCl3/FeCl2/CS mixture by ethanol/NH3·H2O.
Fast precipitate rate induced by ethanol causes too hurried solidification
of CS, so that there is not enough time to densify, resulting in loose
blocks with large pore size, just like Fe3O4–CS3. Adsorption is a physicochemical process that involves
mass transfer of ions from liquid phase to the adsorbent’s
surface, as well as the inner side. So, too narrow pores are not favorable
for ion diffusion, especially for big ions such as HCrO4–. The BJH results reveal that the average pore
size (see Figure S3 and Table S1) of Fe3O4–CS3 (10.0 nm) is much bigger than that
of Fe3O4–CS2 (5.2 nm), and thus Fe3O4–CS3 shows a much better adsorption performance
toward Cr(VI) than Fe3O4–CS2.

A
comparison has been made between the prepared Fe3O4–CS and the previously reported CS-based adsorbents
for Cr(VI) adsorption (see Table S6). The
results show that without any modification, Fe3O4–CS3 gains advantage over many other similar adsorbents (even
the modified ones), indicating that the method we explored can greatly
improve the adsorption efficiency of CS, and thus provides a better
platform for the further chemical modification of magnetic CS.

2.3.6 Desorption and Reusability
Usually,
NaOH is used to regenerate heavy metal ions-loaded CS-based adsorbents
because OH– ionized from NaOH can neutralize the
protonated amino group of CS, resulting in the desorption of the adsorbed
ions. Taking Cr(VI)-loaded Fe3O4–CS as
an example, the desorption process could be proposed as follows. 9  Effect of concentration of NaOH solution on
the desorption of the Cr(VI)-loaded Fe3O4–CS
is shown in Figure 7a. It is obvious that the optimal desorption rates of Fe3O4–CS1, Fe3O4–CS2,
and Fe3O4–CS3 are 85.96, 96.97, and 94.75%,
respectively, at C(NaOH) = 0.05 mol/L.
Therefore, 0.05 mol/L was further used to evaluate their reusability
toward Cr(VI) (Figure 7b), and the corresponding adsorption–desorption cyclic process
is proposed in Figure 8. After three adsorption–desorption cycles, the adsorption
capacities of Fe3O4–CS1, Fe3O4–CS2, and Fe3O4–CS3
are reduced by 27.8, 16.4, and 13.6%, respectively. Therefore, Fe3O4–CS3 with slight losses after recycling
for three times possesses the largest potential for Cr(VI) removal.

capacity of Fe3O4–CS for Cr(VI) during

cycle of Fe3O4–CS.

3 Conclusions
Three
magnetic CS composites prepared from different blending/precipitating
processes show significant difference in terms of Cr(VI) removal.
For Fe3O4–CS1, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles incline to anchor on the surface of the CS,
resulting in high surface area but leaving the valuable CS surface
seriously covered. While for Fe3O4−CS2 prepared from precipitating the mixture of FeCl3/FeCl2/CS by NH3·H2O, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles uniformly disperse in the continuous
CS phase, making more CS participate in the electrostatic adsorption
reaction. Accordingly, it shows a much better adsorption performance
than Fe3O4–CS1. Most noticeably, Fe3O4–CS3, via precipitating FeCl3/FeCl2/CS mixture by ethanol/NH3·H2O, shows a significantly enhanced adsorption performance with
the highest adsorption capacity of 242.1 mg/g (≈468.6 mg/g
of CS). Fast precipitate rate induced by ethanol causes too hurried
solidification of CS, so that there is not enough time for Fe3O4–CS3 to densify, resulting in loose blocks
with large pore size.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of Fe3O4–CS
4.1.1 Fe3O4–CS1
Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared by a coprecipitation
method. Typically, 10 mmol FeCl3·6H2O and
5 mmol FeCl2·4H2O were added into 50 mL
deionized water under stirring for 30 min at 40 °C. Then, 10
mL ammonia solution was added into the above solution dropwise, and
the precipitate was separated by a magnet and washed by deionized
water and ethanol, respectively.

One gram of CS was dissolved
in 50 mL acetic solution (2% v/v) and then the as-prepared Fe3O4 nanoparticles were added into it. After the
mixture was sonicated for 30 min, 15 mL GLA (cross-linker) was added
into it for cross-link reaction under mechanical stirring for 2 h.
The precipitate was washed with ethanol and then distilled water and
dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C.

4.1.2 Fe3O4–CS2
One gram of CS was dissolved
in 50 mL FeCl3 aqueous
solution containing 10 mmol FeCl3·6H2O,
and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. Then, 5 mmol FeCl2·4H2O was added into the CS–Fe(III) solution
under stirring for 2 h at 40 °C. Then, 10 mL ammonia solution
was added into the above solution dropwise, resulting in Fe3O4–CS precipitate, which was separated by a magnetic
field, washed by ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C.
After complete grinding, it was redispersed in 50 mL of GLA/ethanol
solution (10 ml GLA + 40 mL ethanol) for a cross-link reaction under
mechanical stirring for 2 h. The precipitate was washed with ethanol
and deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C.

4.1.3 Fe3O4–CS3
Its preparation
process was similar to that of Fe3O4–CS2,
except that the mixture containing 10 mL ammonia
and 100 mL ethanol was added into the FeCl3/FeCl2/CS solution instead of “10 mL ammonia solution”.

4.2 Characterization
Detailed information
on the X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron
microscope (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET), ζ-potential, and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM)
are available in the Supporting Information.

4.3 Batch Adsorption Experiments
The
different concentrations of Cr(VI) ions were prepared from K2Cr2O7, and the pH value was adjusted by HCl
or NaOH. All the experiments were performed on a rotary shaker (180
r/min) at 25 °C. The residual Cr(VI) concentration was measured
by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-1240, Shimadzu, Japan). The
adsorption capacities (mg/g) of the samples were calculated as follows 10  where C0 and Ct (mg/L) are the Cr(VI) concentrations at the
initial time and time t, respectively; m (g) and V (L) represent the weight of the adsorbents
and volume of the solution, respectively; and qe (mg/g) and Ce (mg/L) are the
equilibrium adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and the equilibrium
concentration of Cr(VI), respectively.

The other adsorption
experiments were conducted in terms of the effects of pH, adsorption
kinetics, adsorption isotherm, desorption, and reusability, as described
in the Supporting Information.
