In this study, a
multicomponent reaction involving carbohydrates, β-dicarbonyl
compounds, and malononitrile was disclosed to synthesize a new class
of polyhydroxy compounds incorporating pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine, pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine and chromene
heterocycles under mild conditions. For the synthesis of this class
of compounds, glucose, galactose, arabinose, maltose, and lactose
were used as aldehyde component in the reaction with barbituric acid
and malononitrile to produce pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine
derivatives. By use of 1,3-cyclohexanedione instead of barbituric
acid, chromene derivatives incorporating carbohydrate moieties were
obtained. Also, the four-component condensation reaction between d-glucosamine, aldehyde, malononitrile, and barbituric acid
was efficiently provided polyhydroxy-substituted pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives. This new combinatorial approach
gave a range of carbohydrate-derived heterocycles in good to excellent
yields with high potential biological applications. The antioxidant
activities were evaluated using 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid) antioxidant measuring system, and the data were expressed as
Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity. All of these compounds display
significant antioxidant activity. The maximum and minimum antioxidant
activities were observed for 4j and 6b,
respectively. Our results indicated encouraging perspectives for the
improvement and usage of this type of synthetic compounds, indicating
significant levels of antioxidant activity.

Introduction
Carbohydrates are
recognized as environmentally friendly starting materials with several
key characteristics, including abundant availability, high water solubility,
and optical activity.1 Synthesis of biologically
active compounds, design of molecular recognition devices, and their
use as chiral auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis are discussed in
most of the utilization reports on carbohydrates.2−4 The existence of a large number of free
hydroxyl groups in the structure of carbohydrates caused their high
solubility in an aqueous environment. Thus, the water solubility of
a biologically active molecule can be tuned by incorporation of a
carbohydrate moiety in its structure. Due to these facts, there are
a lot of applications for carbohydrate derivatives in medicinal chemistry.
Several drugs based on carbohydrates for antibiotics, antiviral, protein
glycosylation, and glycosylation inhibitors have been developed.5−8

Moreover, carbohydrates have been used as reagent in organic synthesis
to obtain new organic molecules containing carbohydrate fragments.
Along this line, some of the heterocycles, including pyrazines, imidazoles,
quinoxalines, pyrazolo[3,4-b]-quinoxalines, and benzimidazoles,
have been synthesized using carbohydrates as reagent.9−15 For example, there are some reports on the use of
carbohydrate-based heterocycles as corrosion inhibitor of mild steels.16,17

One of the most important strategies to provide structurally
diverse natural productlike compounds is multicomponent reaction (MCR).18−20 MCR is a smart synthetic strategy,
because it is possible to make a complex product in a single step,
whereas molecular diversity can be simply achieved by the selection
of desired components. In this situation, MCRs are widely used to
generate new compounds based on carbohydrate derivatives. According
to the functionality of carbohydrate, it is possible to consider it
as a component in MCRs. For example, reducing sugars can be used as
aldehyde and amino sugars as amine component. The presence of a carbohydrate
as aldehyde or an amine component in MCRs opens our hands in the synthesis
of new carbohydrate-based library molecules.21−25

Aminocarbonitrile derivatives are an important
class of organic molecules that possess many applications in organic
synthesis. In this regard, preparation of aminocarbonitriles is very
attractive and MCRs are useful approaches in the synthesis of aminocarbonitrile
derivatives.26−31 More importantly, aminocarbonitriles also showed
interesting biological activities. For instance, there is a report
on anticancer activity of some 2-amino-chromene-nitriles.32

Oxidative stress causes an imbalance between
creation and accumulation of oxygen reactive species in cells and
tissue, playing a major role in the progress of various chronic and
degenerative illnesses, such as aging, cancer, cataract, autoimmune
disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative
diseases. The human body has several mechanisms to offset oxidative
stress by producing antioxidants, which are either naturally produced
in human body or externally provided through foods and/or supplements.33 However, without exogenous antioxidant compounds,
our endogenous antioxidant defense systems are incomplete. Hence,
there are continuous requests for exogenous antioxidants to prevent
oxidative stress.34

Previously, our
research group reported on the use of natural small molecules, including
carbohydrates, nucleosides, and curcumin, in MCRs for one-pot synthesis
of some biologically active
compounds.35−41 In continuation of our program
on the synthesis of natural product-based compound libraries, in this
study, we disclosed a new MCR between carbohydrates, β-dicarbonyl
compounds, and malononitrile. This combinatorial reaction afforded
synthesis of novel classes of pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine,
pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine, and chromene derivatives,
incorporating carbohydrate moieties. Also, the antioxidant activity
of the synthetic compounds was investigated, demonstrating that all
of them have reasonable antioxidant activity.

Results and Discussion
Initially, (+)-d-glucose
(1a) was reacted with barbituric acid (2a) and malononitrile (3a) in EtOH in the presence of
20 mol % para-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) to give
glucose analogue 4a as a white crystal in 85% isolated
yield (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 One-Pot Synthesis

on (+)-d-Glucose
Reaction conditions:
(+)-d-glucose (1 mmol), barbituric acid (1 mmol), malononitrile
(1 mmol), EtOH (5 mL), and PTSA (20 mol %).

To find the optimum condition for this reaction, different experiments
were done on the above reaction (Scheme 1) and results are shown in Table 1.

b Isolated
yield.

As shown in Table 1, low yield of product
was obtained in the absence of catalyst in reflux ethanol condition
after 24 h (Table 1, entry 1). The reaction yield was enhanced to 85% after addition
of 20 mol % PTSA as catalyst (Table 1, entry 2). An improvement in yield was observed by
use of 30 mol % of catalyst (Table 1, entry 3). There was no improvement in the reaction
yield with increasing the amount of catalyst to 35 mol % (Table 1, entry 4). Thus 30
mol % of PTSA as catalyst was recognized as optimum catalyst loading
for the reaction. For comparison, two other catalysts, including l-proline and Et3N, were also tested but no improvement
in reaction yield was detected (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). Other solvents including water
and acetonitrile were also checked, and no superiority in reaction
yield was observed (Table 1, entries 7 and 8). Decreasing the reaction temperature reduces
the reaction yield significantly so that at room temperature, only
35% of the product was isolated (Table 1, entries 9 and 10). Also, no improvement in the reaction
yield was observed by increase of the reaction temperature to 80 °C
(Table 1, entry 11).

After optimization study, to show the generality and scope of the
protocol, some new derivatives using different sugars were synthesized
and results are summarized in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 One-Pot Synthesis of a Pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine Derivatives
Using MCR of Sugars, Barbituric Acid, and Malononitrile
Reaction conditions:
sugar (1 mmol),
barbituric acid (1 mmol), malononitrile/diethyl malonate/ethyl 2-cyanoacetate
(1 mmol), EtOH (5 mL), and PTSA (30 mol %).

As shown in Scheme 2, this methodology is efficient for the synthesis
of diverse pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives using
different sugars and malononitrile/diethyl malonate/ethyl 2-cyanoacetate.
Since only the anomeric carbon engaged in the reaction, it is logical
that the enantiomeric centers remain unchanged in the product.

By the use of galactose instead of glucose in the reaction, compound 4b was obtained in 88% isolated yield. Arabinose as a pentose
was also used in the reaction and afforded compound 4c, incorporating a 4-hydroxy carbon chain. Lactose and maltose were
also used as disaccharide carbohydrate to show further applicability
of this method in the synthesis of other polyhydroxy-substituted pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidines (4d and 4e).

With this procedure, diethyl malonate was also obtained
and ester derivative of polyhydroxy-substituted pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine was synthesized in good to excellent yields
(4f–i). As shown, both monosaccharides
and disaccharides underwent the reaction to afford corresponding products
under optimized conditions.

Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate is another
reagent that was used in this protocol, and β-amino ester derivatives
of pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidines were obtained (4j and 4k).

In another attempt, cyclohexane-1,3-dione
was used instead of barbituric acid and this reaction resulted to
polyhydroxy-functionalized chromene-3-carbonitrile derivatives (Scheme 3). These experiments
resulted in the production of compounds 6a and 6b in 78 and 84% under optimized conditions, respectively.
Compound 6a was obtained from glucose and 6b was obtained from lactose.

Scheme 3 One-Pot Synthesis of Chromene-3-carbonitrile Derivatives Using MCR
of Sugars, Cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and Malononitrile
Reaction conditions:
sugar (1 mmol),
cyclohexane-1,3-dione (1 mmol), malononitrile (1 mmol), EtOH (5 mL),
and PTSA (30 mol %).

To show the generality and scope
of the reaction further, a four-component coupling reaction was conducted
between d-glucosamine, aldehyde, barbituric acid, and malononitrile.
This MCR resulted in the generation of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives in good to excellent yields (Scheme 4). In this reaction, it is
possible to synthesize different derivatives using a selection of
different aldehydes. Both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
aldehydes gave products under standard conditions. For aldehydes with
electron-withdrawing group such as nitro and cyano, more than 92%
of product was isolated (8a and 8d). As
shown in this reaction, d-glucosamine (an amino sugar) acts
as an amine component.

Scheme 4 One-Pot Synthesis
of a Class of Pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine Derivatives
Using a Four-Component Reaction of d-Glucosamine, Aldehyde,
Barbituric Acid, and Malononitrile
Reaction conditions: d-glucosamine
(1 mmol),
barbituric acid (1 mmol), malononitrile (1 mmol), aldehyde (1 mmol),
EtOH (5 mL), and PTSA (10 mol %). All yields refer to isolated products.

In view of the reaction mechanism (Scheme 5), according to the
literature,42,43 it seems that the first activated
dicarbonyl compound reacts with sugar as an aldehyde component to
form a Knoevenagel intermediate (A). Reaction of malononitrile
to the Knoevenagel intermediate resulted in the production of (B). Nucleophilic addition of hydroxy group in enol form with
cyano group resulted in the formation of intermediate (C). The tautomerization in this intermediate affords pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine and chromene derivatives.

Scheme 5 Proposed Mechanism for Polyhydroxy-Functionalized
Pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine and Chromene Derivatives
In the four-component
reaction (Scheme 6),42,43 the reaction proceeds with the formation of Knoevenagel intermediate
between barbituric acid and aldehyde (D). Michael addition
of malononitrile with the Knoevenagel intermediate led to the production
of an intermediate (E). It is proposed that in this stage, d-glucosamine as an amine component reacts with the intermediate
(E) and forms enamine (F), which is highly
disposed to undergo cyclization via reaction of amino group and cyano
group.

Scheme 6 Proposed Reaction
Mechanism for One-Pot Synthesis of Pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine
Derivatives Using d-Glucose Amine
After synthesis and characterization of the carbohydrate
derivatives, their antioxidant activity was evaluated and results
were expressed as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). The
higher TEAC value shows the higher antioxidant power of the compound,
as shown in Table 2. The results indicated that all of these synthetic compounds have
significant antioxidant activity, and among them, compound 4j with the TEAC value of 5.237 ± 0.053 μM displays the
most antioxidant activity than other synthetic compounds. Also, thereafter, 4k and 4c, respectively, stand in the second
and third positions on the basis of their antioxidant activity.

(SDs) were determined.

As shown in Table 2, the significant antioxidant properties were observed for the synthetic
compounds 4j, 4k, and 4c. The
antioxidant activity of these compounds changed with change of substructures.
When in a class of compounds a part is fixed, it is observable that
the antioxidant activity is changed remarkably, which can be attributed
to the reducing (electron-donating) power of that fragment. For compounds 4a–e (the heterocycle parts are pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine and aminocarbonitrile), results demonstrated
that compound 4c with arabinose carbohydrate is a superior
antioxidant.44 As shown in Table 2, the antioxidant activity of
compounds containing galactose is less than that of others (4b and 4i). With pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine compounds containing β-keto ester, the antioxidant
activity is to some extent more than that of pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidines incorporating aminocarbonitrile fragment, representing
that the role of β-keto ester moiety is effective than that
of aminocarbonitrile in antioxidant activity of these compounds.45 The high antioxidant activity was obtained for
the compounds containing aminocarbonitrile and β-amino ester
moieties (4j and 4k).46 Also, the lowest antioxidant activity was observed for
compound 6b with a TEAC value of 0.169 ± 0.019 μM,
which contains a chromene-3-carbonitrile moiety.47 For compounds 8a–d, which
are pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives containing d-glucosamine, the antioxidant activity depends on the type
of aryl ring, and for rings bearing nitro group (8d),
a relatively good activity was obtained.35

Also, data in Figures 1–3, are
in complete agreement with TEACs values (Table 2). The results presented in these figures
suggest that the higher antioxidant activity associates with more
reduction in the absorbance value at 734 nm. Antioxidant capacity
of the synthetic ligands was measured using the 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid) (ABTS) decolorization assay. To express antioxidant capacity,
we used the water soluble vitamin E analogue as a standard compound.
The reduction of the radical cation by the synthetic compounds was
measured as the percentage inhibition of absorbance at 734 nm. The
percentage inhibition curves were drawn as a function of concentration
of the test compounds. The slope of these curves was obtained and
divided with that of Trolox (4.87), and the final results were expressed
as TEAC.48

and 6b (hollow diamonds).

Conclusions
In summary, we have illustrated an efficient
multicomponent approach for the synthesis of a new library of polyhydroxy-functionalized
heterocyclic compounds using carbohydrates. In this protocol, reducing
sugars act as aldehyde component and amino sugars act as amine component
to participate in MCRs containing dicarbonyl compounds and malononitrile.
These MCRs afforded a range of novel pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine, pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine, and chromene
derivatives incorporating carbohydrate moieties and 3-aminocarbonitrile
unite under environmental conditions. The method is simple, and gave
the target products in good to excellent isolated yields and with
high purity. The diversity of molecules in this study achieved by
selection of carbohydrate (monosaccharide and disaccharide), dicarbonyl
compound, and malononitrile, suggests an interesting scaffold containing
both chiral polyhydroxy chain and biologically active heterocycles.
The synthetic compounds revealed excellent antioxidant effectiveness
in the ABTS system, which increases their potential therapeutic values.

Experimental Section
General
Chemicals were purchased from Fluka and Aldrich
chemical companies and used without further purification. The known
products were characterized by comparison of their spectra and physical
data with those reported in the literature. Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy (Shimadzu FT-IR 8300 spectrophotometer) was employed for characterization of the synthesized compounds. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 250 and 400 MHz, and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 62.5, 75, and 100 MHz in dimethyl
sulfoxide-d6 using tetramethylsilane as
an internal standard. Melting points were determined in open capillary
tubes in a Barnstead Electrothermal 9100 BZ circulating oil melting
point apparatus. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on
silica gel 254 analytical sheets obtained from Fluka. Column chromatography
was carried out on silica gel 60 Merck (230–240 mesh) in glass
columns (2 or 3 cm diameter) using 15–30 g of silica gel per
1 g of the crude mixture.

Chemistry
General Procedure for Preparation of 4a–k
A mixture of barbituric acid (1.0 mmol),
sugar (1.0 mmol), malononitrile/diethyl malonate/ethylacetoacetate
(1.0 mmol), and para-toluenesulfonic acid (30.0 mol
%) in EtOH (5.0 mL) at 50 °C was stirred for 20 h. Completion
of the reaction was confirmed by TLC (eluent EtOAc–MeOH). The
reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. Then, the reaction
mixture was filtered and the remaining mixture was washed with ethanol
(3 × 5 mL). Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure gave
almost pure products, which were further purified by recrystallization
from EtOH.

Procedure To Prepare
Compound 6a and 6b
A mixture of
cyclohexane-1,3-dione (1 mmol), sugar (1 mmol), malononitrile (1 mmol),
and PTSA (30 mol %) in EtOH (3 mL) at 50 °C was stirred for 15
h. Completion of the reaction was confirmed by TLC (eluent EtOAc–MeOH).
The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The extraction
and purification of products were same as compound 4a–k.

General
Procedure To Prepare Compound 8a–d
A mixture of barbituric acid (1 mmol), aldehyde (1 mmol), d-glucosamine (1 mmol), and PTSA (10 mol %) in ethanol (5 mL)
at 50 °C was stirred for 12 h. Completion of the reaction was
confirmed by TLC (eluent CH2Cl2/MeOH). The reaction
mixture was cooled to room temperature. The extraction and purification
of products were same as those for compound 4a–k.

Biology
The ABTS procedure assay followed the method originally suggested
by Re et al.49 The ABTS radical cation
(ABTS•+) was generated by reaction of ABTS solution
(7 mM) and (2.45 mM final concentration) potassium persulfate solution
at a molar ratio of 1:0.5. The mixture was held in dark at 25 °C
for 12–16 h before being used, and then it was diluted with
5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to obtain an absorbance of 0.7 ±
0.02 units at 734 nm using a T90+ UV–vis spectrophotometer.
An accurate amount of sample was added to 1 mL of the reagent and
incubated at 25 °C. Then, the decrease of absorbance at 734 nm
was measured at the end point of 6 min. A solvent blank was run in
each assay and a water soluble vitamin E analogue (Trolox) used as
the standard. The results were expressed as Trolox equivalent antioxidant
capacity (TEAC).
