In this study, hydrogels
were synthesized through the radical polymerization
of hardwood kraft lignin, N-isopropylacrylamide,
and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide.
Statistical analyses were employed to produce lignin-based hydrogels
with the highest yield and swelling capacity. The success of the polymerization
reactions was confirmed by NMR and Fourier infrared spectroscopy.
The lignin-based hydrogel was more thermally and rheological stable,
but exhibited less swelling affinity, than synthetic hydrogel. The
rheological studies indicated that the swollen hydrogels were predominantly
elastic and exhibited a critical solution temperature that was between
34 and 37 °C. Compared with the synthetic hydrogel, lignin-based
hydrogel behaved less elastic as temperature increased. In addition
to inducing a green hydrogel, the results confirmed that hardwood
lignin-based hydrogel would have different properties than synthetic-based
hydrogels, which could be beneficial for some applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Hydrogels are often described as three-dimensional
polymeric networks
formed from cross-linked hydrophilic homopolymers, copolymers, or
macromers.1−4 They are insoluble polymer matrices capable of retaining a large
amount of water in their swollen state; in some cases, up to a thousand
times of their dry weight. Their swelling capability allows them to
obtain the shape of their surroundings when confined.2,5,6

Depending on the source
of polymers, hydrogels may be synthetic,
natural, or hybrid.2 Hydrogels may be degradable
in aqueous environments, making them biocompatible in most cases and
a good carrier for nutrients to cells and their metabolic products.5 They have been deemed to be efficient in the
protection of cells and fragile drugs, such as peptides and proteins.5 Some hydrogels have exhibited stimuli-induced
swelling and deswelling capabilities without disintegration.7−9 The advantage of tunable properties has given hydrogels attention
for biomedical and environmental applications.10,11 Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) is a thermoresponsive
hydrogel.12−14 However, the applications of PNIPAAm hydrogels are
limited by their fragility.15,16 These applications
can be extended via enhancing their rigidity.

Recently, lignin
(LGN) has been incorporated into the production
of flocculants, dispersants, and hydrogels because lignin is biocompatible
and biodegradable with low toxicity.17−20 At a relatively low production
cost,21 lignin presents the greatest available
aromatic renewable resource worldwide, as well as a primary supplier
of soil’s organic matter.6,22 Lignin provides the
structural strength of plants by nature, which makes it a potential
candidate for PNIPAAm hydrogel modifications.

Previous studies
have been conducted on synthesizing hydrogels
using different types of lignin through free radical polymerization.
Acetic acid lignin was incorporated into N-isopropylacrylamide
(NIPAAm) for hydrogel production.23 The
kinetics studies indicated that the lignin-containing hydrogel retained
7.2% more water than the lignin-free hydrogel over 10 min of swelling.23 In another work, wheat straw alkali lignin was
cross-linked with acrylic acid and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAAm) via free radical polymerization.24 The addition of acid hydrolysis lignin was found
to greatly improve the surface morphology and swelling affinity of
the hydrogel.25 Yu et al. developed lignosulfonate-g-acrylic acid hydrogels by grafting acrylic acid onto lignosulfonate
with MBAAm as a cross-linker and lacase/tert-butyl
hydroperoxide as the initiator.26

It is well known that the type of lignin (i.e., hardwood vs softwood
vs nonwood) and its production process (i.e., enzymatic hydrolysis
vs kraft vs sulfite treatment) affect its structure and chemical properties,
which, in turn, affect its polymerization performance and end-use
applications.27−32 There is currently limited research on the use of hardwood kraft
lignin for hydrogel production following free radical polymerization.
As hardwood is vastly available for end-use applications, it is of
great importance to investigate the performance of hardwood lignin
for hydrogel productions.17−21

The first objective of this study was to evaluate the cross-linking
of hardwood-based kraft lignin with NIPAAm as the monomer and MBAAm
as the cross-linker. The second objective of this study was to investigate
the thermal and rheological properties of kraft lignin-based hydrogels,
as well as their swelling performance. The main novelty of this work
was the investigations on the use of hardwood kraft lignin as a commercially
available resource in hydrogel production and on the properties and
performance of the induced hydrogels under different scenarios.

Results
and Discussion
Polymerization
The free radical
polymerization for
producing lignin-based hydrogels is demonstrated in Figure 1. Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN)
first undergoes thermal decomposition to generate radicals, which
initiates the polymerization. Figure 1a demonstrates the thermal decomposition of the azo
compounds with heating, which produces two 2-cyanoprop-2-yl radicals
and nitrogen gas.33 In this case, 2-cyanoprop-2-yl
radicals can then be transferred to lignin, NIPAAm, or MBAAm present
in the reaction mixture. When the free radical is transferred to lignin,
it will abstract hydrogen from the hydroxyl group located on lignin’s
aromatic ring generating a phenoxy radical (I in Figure 1b) along with the corresponding
resonance structures (II in Figure 1b).33 The phenoxy radicals
will then attack the carbon double bonds of the NIPAAm monomers and
the cross-linker MBAAm to form the initial propagating chain, which
can then continue further to form the cross-linked structure (Figure 1c). The radical polymerization
is most commonly terminated through the combination of two active
chains.34 In addition, termination may
occur via adjusting pH (i.e., sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide).

and (c) cross-linking reaction.

Effect of Reaction Conditions
Taguchi L9 orthogonal
design is presented in Table 1. Typically, NIPAAm and MBAAm are used together to form hydrogels,
and only using one of them cannot facilitate hydrogel production.
Generally, the ratio of reactants affects the properties of the induced
products in reactions. Compared with other reactants in this polymerization
reaction system, lignin is more difficult to handle in terms of its
solubility, reactivity, and pH adjustment in solutions. Therefore,
to have a better control over the reactions, we decided to keep the
amount of lignin constant in the reactions but to change the quantity
of other components of the reaction. The range of analysis was optimized
by evaluating the signal-to-noise (SN) ratio to maximize the responses
of the model. The hydrogel sample of 2L was selected as the best hydrogel
sample based on the results achieved. The control sample (2C) was
produced following reaction conditions of 2L but without lignin.

Multivariate analysis (MANOVA) was
applied to determine whether
there are differences among the levels and factors. A 95% confidence
interval was selected, implying that the response is deemed significant
if the P-value is smaller than 0.05.35 Furthermore, post hoc analysis was applied to determine
where these significant differences exist when considering multiple
levels.36 Tukey’s test was selected
as an effective post hoc model to compare all the possible pairs of
means and determine where they differ within the data.36−38Table 2 demonstrates
the results of the MANOVA for the responses of lignin-based hydrogels.
It is observable that temperature presents a significant effect on
yield (F = 7.84, p = 0.011, η2 = 0.635) and maximum swelling ratio (F =
14.07, p = 0.002, η2 = 0.076). The
cleavage of the azo compounds may occur more rapidly at higher temperatures,
increasing the concentration of radicals present in the solution and
facilitating the reaction.39 This table
also shows that the reaction time presented a large effect with respect
to yield (F = 222.24, p < 0.001,
η2 = 0.980). This is because the time extension allows
for additional cross-linking to occur in the reaction, resulting in
a higher product yield. A significantly large decrease in yield (F = 43.00, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.905) and swelling capacity (F = 16.67, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.787) with increasing
NIPAAm content was determined between 18 and 24 g/g of lignin. The
higher incorporation of monomer into the hydrogels was found to improve
the hydrogel production. Furthermore, the yield (F = 50.89, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.919)
and the maximum swelling ratio (F = 32.00, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.877) exhibit a significant
effect between pH 2.0 and pH 2.5. This is most likely because concentration
of sulfate ions in the reaction mixture leads to the abstraction of
the terminated polymer chains, which, in turn, reinitiates the propagation
step.40

To determine which
lignin-based hydrogel sample exhibited the best
responses, the signal-to-noise (SN) ratio was determined in the Taguchi
analysis. Because the goal for this experiment was to maximize the
response values, the larger-the-better (LB) SN ratio equation, eq 1, was selected42 1  where n is the number of
experiments and yi is
the collected experimental data. The optimal level can then be determined
by selecting the largest SN ratio from each of the performance parameters.42Table 1 lists the signal to noise ratios for selected lignin-based
hydrogel samples, along with their responses (yield and maximum swelling
ratio). The SN values, which maximized both of these responses, were
found to be the highest for 2L. Thus, this sample was selected as
the optimum sample based on the results.

NMR Evaluation
Figure 2 illustrates
the 1H NMR spectrum for the
lignin-based hydrogels. The peak at 1.15 ppm corresponds to two methyl
protons of the N-isopropyl group (A). The proton
of the N-isopropyl group (E) is present at 4.1 ppm.
These large peaks are dominant over the others due to the large content
of NIPAAm within the hydrogels.43,44 The functional groups
for lignin are depicted by a cluster of small peaks from 5 to 8 ppm,
which may be due to the aromatic rings present in kraft lignin. The
peak of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is observable at 2.6 ppm, which
belongs to dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO, (D).43

Figure 2 1H NMR spectrum for lignin-based hydrogels (sample 2L).

Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR) Evaluation
The FTIR spectra of the selected
hydrogels with lignin, 2L, and
without lignin, 2C, are shown in Figure 3. The bands located between 1535 and 1639
cm–1 are attributed to the amide groups found in
NIPAAm as well as in N,N′-methylenebiscrylamide.45,46 These compounds also exhibit a broad spectrum between 3400 and 3200
cm–1, indicating the stretching of the N–H
bond.45,47,48 According
to Konduri and Fatehi,49 the presence of
kraft lignin’s aromatic compounds yields a broad peak between
1593 and 1510 cm–1, which is attributed to the benzene
ring vibrations. There are also absorption peaks present at 1130 and
1171 cm–1, which correspond to the stretching of
the C–O bond on the primary alcohol and ether of kraft lignin,
respectively.45 In addition, the C=O
and C=C stretching may be depicted by the bands located at
approximately 1200 and 1500 cm–1, respectively.
The CH stretching of methyl or methylene groups are also shown to
be present in the peaks between 2300 and 2400 cm–1.48 The peaks at 1535 and 1639 cm–1 were intense for both samples, indicating the presence
of NIPAAm. For this reason, the peaks for NIPAAm overshadow the peaks
at 1593 and 1510 cm–1 for aromatic structure of
lignin.

2C.

TGA Evaluation
The thermal decomposition behavior of
hydrogels of 2L and 2C are shown in Figure 4. An initial weight loss of 10% is generally
due to moisture removal. Afterward, lignin demonstrates a higher thermal
stability in comparison with the other samples, a desirable property
for additional end-use applications.49 Above
200 °C, lignin exhibits a gradual decrease in weight loss and
levels off at a 55% weight loss above 600 °C. This is because
the thermal breakdown of lignin occurs via two competing reaction
paths of the intramolecular condensation and the thermal depolymerization.50−52

Figure 4 Weight
loss and weight loss rates of control and lignin-based hydrogels:
(a) kraft lignin, (b) 2C, and (c) 2L.

Despite relatively similar trends, sample 2C is shown to
be slightly
less thermally stable than 2L. Sample 2C was found to exhibit a major
weight loss at approximately 415 °C, whereas sample 2L exhibited
a primary weight loss at around 420 °C. Zarzyka and co-workers
described that the use of N,N′-methylenebiscrylamide
allows for a higher cross-linking density, which, in turn, decreases
the chain mobility within the gels.53 Because N,N′-methylenebiscrylamide contributes
to cross-linking, it can be assumed that it was readily consumed during
the thermal decomposition reaction.

Surface Properties and
Swelling Behavior
The surface
area properties of the selected samples are shown in Table 4. The hydrogel without lignin,
2C, was found to have a higher surface area, pore volume, and pore
size compared to the lignin-based hydrogel, 2L. This indicates that
2C hydrogel has a more porous structure.23 Lignin-based hydrogel is expected to become less hydrophilic than
its synthetic form due to the incorporation of a hydrophobic polymer
(lignin). Therefore, this hydrogel (2C) exhibited a better swelling
performance in water, as presumably water molecules could diffuse
into its pores more effectively.

Previous studies showed
that the swelling performance of lignin
hydrogels varied in a wide range depending on the hydrogel components
(e.g., lignin types and monomers).6 For
example, lignin-based poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) hydrogels showed relatively
high swelling ratios of 400, 600, and 700 g/g for acid hydrolysis
lignin–PAA, alkali lignin–PAA, and lignosulfonate–PAA
hydrogels, respectively.24,25 The specific surface
area of alkali lignin–PAA hydrogel was reported to be as high
as 122.7 ± 4.51 m2/g.24 On the other hand, hydrogels synthesized by acrylamide and poly(vinyl
alcohol) with alkaline and kraft lignin had a swelling ratio of 8
and 1.5 g/g, respectively.29,52 When cross-linking
with NIPAAm, the hardwood kraft lignin-based hydrogel obtained in
this study exhibited a much higher swelling ratio compared to the
acetic acid lignin-based hydrogel.23

Rheological Behavior
The cross-linked structure of
hydrogels can be further characterized by applying dynamic oscillatory
experiment. A sinusoidal oscillation with a given deformation and
frequency can be applied onto a material to obtain sinusoidal output
for strain.53 Their viscoelastic properties
may be characterized by storage modulus (G′),
which describes the material’s elasticity, and loss modulus
(G″), which is attributed to the viscosity
of materials. The elastic component characterizes a material’s
solid-like ability to store energy (its stiffness), whereas the viscous
component is the liquid-like capability to dissipate energy.54,55

Figure 5 illustrates
the effect of frequency on storage (G′) and
loss (G″) modulus as well as on dynamic viscosity
(η) for both the control and lignin-based hydrogel samples.
Some loss modulus values were unable to be measured accurately at
low frequencies and are thus analyzed from 6.30 rad/s for both samples.56 The storage modulus is greater than that of
the loss modulus for both cases (Figure 5), indicating that the hydrogel samples exhibit
more elastic properties. This behavior is typical for hydrogels as
the solid-like mechanical properties of their cross-linked structure
are more dominant than the viscous properties, which is attributed
to the small amorphous part of the polymer network.53

Figure 5 Frequency sweep of the control and lignin-based hydrogels: (a)
moduli of 2C and 2L and (b) dynamic viscosity of 2C and 2L.

In addition, both storage and
loss modulus were found to increase
with increasing shear frequency, allowing for more energy to be dissipated.
Although frequency is shown to influence the moduli curves, its dependence
is largely insignificant, indicating that the hydrogels have a well-structured
three-dimensional network.57 Furthermore,
the dynamic viscosity is shown to linearly decrease with increasing
frequency, an attribute typical to hydrogels.53 The amount of energy dissipated was found to be slightly greater
for the control samples (2C) than for the lignin-based sample (2L).
This may be due to the incorporation of lignin resulting in a less
cross-linked structure. In other words, the network structure of the
control samples is more tightly cross-linked and is therefore better
able to dissipate energy.

For amplitude sweep test, linear viscoelastic
region (LVR) for
both samples are shown in Figure 6. The strain applied does not exhibit a strong effect
on the moduli, which serves as an indication of the hydrogels’
rigidity.58 In addition, the storage modulus
is shown to exhibit a greater plateau, indicating that the samples’
viscoelastic behavior.59

Figure 6 Strain amplitude sweep
of the control and lignin-based hydrogels:
(a) 2C and (b) 2L.

On the other hand, the
storage modulus is shown to significantly
decrease with increasing strain, indicating a disturbance within the
network structure. The loss modulus slightly increases before rapidly
decreasing to 100% strain. This maximum indicates the microscopic
failure within the hydrogel’s network structure, which indicates
breaking of the interaction present within the polymer matrix.60 At this point, the storage and loss moduli exhibit
a crossover where the hydrogel exhibits a phase change from primarily
elastic to primarily viscous.56 This indicates
the irreversible deformation of the three-dimensional network structure,
which provides the hydrogel its elasticity.54,61

The crossover for the hydrogel 2C was shown to occur at a
lower
strain rate compared to the hydrogel 2L. This increase in rheological
stability with applied strain is most likely due to the incorporation
of lignin.53 In addition, the LVR has a
larger width for the lignin-based sample compared with the control
sample, further supporting that the incorporation of lignin increases
the samples’ rigidity.

Figure 7 shows the
effect of the stress on the modulus resulting from amplitude sweep
tests. The initial plateau designates the LVR, for which the change
in modulus is denoted by the yield point (τy). As
the modulus exhibits a crossover from mainly elastic to mainly viscoelastic,
this crossover is known as the flow point (τf). These
results for both these points are summarized in Table 5. The flow point and yield point for the
lignin-based hydrogel were found to be greater than those for the
control sample, indicating that lignin improved the hydrogels’
rheological performance.

Figure 8 demonstrates
the rheological properties for both elastic and viscous moduli of
the hydrogel samples at different temperatures. At low temperatures,
the moduli curves dropped with increasing temperature. At approximately
34–37 °C, there is a slight valley in the moduli curves,
which is attributed to the lower critical solution temperature (LCST)
of NIPAAm (32–34 °C). At this temperature, the hydrogels
undergo a reversible phase transition from their swollen state to
a shrunken dehydrated state.23,47 Afterward, the difference
between the elastic and viscous moduli becomes smaller, but does not
reach a crossover temperature. In other words, the hydrogel samples
do not exhibit a phase transition, but rather undergo a plateau with
increasing temperature, indicating their thermal stability.57

Figure 8 Temperature ramp of the control and lignin-based hydrogels:
(a)
2C and (b) 2L.

The control hydrogel
(2C) exhibits a larger modulus than the lignin-based
hydrogel (2L), indicating that the control hydrogel has more elastic
properties even with increasing temperature. In addition, following
the LCST, the gap between the elastic and viscous modulus decreases
more significantly for the lignin-based hydrogels, which suggests
that the lignin-based hydrogels approach the sol–gel temperature
more readily than the control hydrogel.62

Conclusions
Hardwood lignin-based hydrogels were successfully
produced through
radical polymerization of lignin, NIPAAm, and MBAAm, as confirmed
by the NMR and FTIR analyses. Thermogravimetric analysis determined
that the hydrogels exhibited two decomposition stages attributed to
the breakdown of the aliphatic alkenes groups and the remaining carboxylic
and amine groups. Although lignin-based hydrogel had less swelling
affinity, as it possessed smaller surface area and more porous structure
than synthetic one, it was more thermally stable. The slightly greater
energy dissipated for the control hydrogel than for the lignin-based
hydrogel implied that the incorporation of lignin generated less cross-linked
hydrogel. Lignin tended to increase the rigidity and rheological stability
of hydrogel. Compared with the control hydrogel, lignin-based hydrogel
behaved less elastic as temperature increased. These results suggest
that hardwood lignin-based hydrogel can be produced, but its properties
are different from synthetic-based hydrogels.

Methodology
Materials
Mixed hardwood kraft lignin (LGN) was supplied
by FPInnovations’ pilot plant facility located in Thunder Bay,
ON. NIPAAm (97%), MBAAm (99%), azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, 98%),
acetone (97%), dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO,
99.9% atom D), and tetramethylthionine chloride (methylene blue) were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Sulfuric acid (98%) and sodium hydroxide
(97%) were also obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and diluted with deionized
water to 20 and 10%, respectively.

Reaction
In this
set of experiments, 0.1 g of kraft
lignin, 0.06 g of MBAAm, and varying concentrations of NIPAAm (1.2–2.4
g) were dissolved in round-bottom glass flasks with deionized distilled
water. The pH of the solutions was then adjusted with 20% sulfuric
acid and 10% sodium hydroxide to pH 2.0–3.0 before being purging
with nitrogen gas for 30 min. Water was added into the flasks to generate
the total mass of reaction (40 g), which includes the weight of the
reactants. The flask was placed in a water bath and heated to the
desired temperature before adding 0.08 g of the AIBN initiator. The
reaction was then allowed to proceed at the steady-state temperature
(65–85 °C), with a constant flow of nitrogen gas at 220
rpm. This procedure was repeated for samples with and without lignin.
After completion, the hydrogel samples were extracted from the flasks
and rinsed with acetone to remove unreacted monomers. The hydrogels
were then rinsed with water to prevent further degradation and freeze-dried
at −50 °C for over 24 h in a Labconco FreeZone 1L freeze-dryer.
The yield of the hydrogel production was calculated following eq 2 2  where WHydrogel is the total dry weight of the hydrogel (g) and WLGN, WNIPAAm, WMBAAm, WAIBN are the initial
weights of kraft lignin, NIPAAm, MBAAm, and AIBN, respectively.

The L9 Taguchi orthogonal design was performed with four factors
(each containing three levels) to investigate the effect of reaction
parameters on the responses (i.e., yield of reaction and swelling
ratio) for producing hydrogels.

1H NMR Spectroscopy
The freeze-dried hydrogel
samples were ground to powder before being dissolved in 0.5 g of deuterated
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6), and placed
into a 5 mm, 500 MHz glass NMR tube. The sample containing tubes were
inserted into the Varian Unity INOVA 500 MHz NMR machine. The 1H NMR spectra of the samples were acquired at a 15° pulse
flipping angle, a 4.6 μm pulse width, a 2.05 acquisition time,
and 1 s relaxation delay time.

Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy
Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was conducted for the selected
hydrogel samples (0.001 g) using a Bruker Tensor 37 (Germany, ATR
accessory). The IR spectra was recorded in transmittance mode within
the wave number range of 500–4000 cm–1 with
a 4 cm–1 resolution.

Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) Surface Analysis
The surface area of the hydrogel particles
was determined by using
a Quantachrome surface area analyzer, Nova 2200e, instrument. The
freeze-dried hydrogels were first ground to powder and passed through
multiple sieves. The particles with the size fraction between 150
and 300 μm were selected for analysis. For each test, 0.05 g
of the powder samples were taken into account for specific surface
area analysis according to Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
method via adsorption–desorption isotherms using nitrogen gas
at −180 °C with the relative pressure range of 0.01–0.99.

samples were placed in a desiccator overnight before undergoing thermal
analysis using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA i-1000 series, Instrument
Specialist Inc.). Approximately, 8 mg of sample was heated at a constant
flow rate of nitrogen (35 mL/min) from room temperature to 700 °C
at the heating rate of 10 °C/min.

Swelling Performance
The freeze-dried hydrogel samples
were cut and divided into samples weighing approximately 0.2 g. The
dried samples (with a known weight) were immersed into 200 mL of deionized
water for 24 h. The swelling ratio was determined by considering the
swollen weight of the hydrogel samples and the initial weight of dried
hydrogels following eq 3 3  where Wswollen is the
weight of the swollen hydrogel and Wdry is the initial weight of the dry hydrogel.

Rheology
A rheometer,
TA Instruments, Discovery HR-2,
with a Peltier temperature control system was used for analyzing the
viscoelastic properties of hydrogel samples. The upper geometry was
a 40 mm steel parallel plate with a gap of 1 mm and a loading gap
of 60 mm. The dynamic oscillatory measurements were carried out at
a constant temperature of 25 °C, unless stated otherwise. The
hydrogels were prepared for the rheology test according to the method
described elsewhere.53 The hydrogel samples
were saturated in deionized water before testing and were loaded onto
the Peltier plate to cover the surface area of the parallel plate.
Attempts have been made so that the same amount of the hydrogel samples
with similar thickness was loaded on the Peltier plate for each test.
Three tests of frequency sweep, amplitude sweep, and temperature ramp
have been applied on the samples in this set of experiments. The frequency
test was carried out at a shear stress of 0.2 Pa throughout the frequency
range of 0.2–20 Hz (1.267–125.7 rad/s). The amplitude
sweep was obtained at a constant frequency mode of 10 rad/s over a
strain rate range of 0.01–1000%. The temperature ramp was recorded
at a constant strain rate of 2%, with a low frequency of 10 rad/s
over a temperature range of 0–50 °C. The temperature ramp
rate was 5 °C/min.
