A novel bimetallic
and reusable Y2ZnO4 nanocatalyst
was synthesized by a simple coprecipitation method. The prepared nanocatalyst
exhibited dual catalytic activity and was characterized using X-ray
diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). The average crystallite and grain sizes were found
to be 17 ± 1 and 10 ± 2 nm, respectively. On the one hand,
the catalytic activity of the nanocatalyst was studied for the Knoevenagel
condensation reaction of aromatic aldehydes with active methylene
compounds, such as ethyl cyanoacetate and malononitrile, under microwave
irradiation and solvent-free conditions. On the other hand, the nanoparticles
also showed faster photocatalytic activity against methyl orange (MO)
compared to other dyes. The nanocatalyst was easily recoverable by
a simple filtration method and was recycled without any significant
loss of catalytic activity. The advantages of this nanocatalyst were
a simple workup procedure, high reaction yields, solvent-free conditions,
reusability, and a short reaction time under green reaction conditions.

Introduction
In recent years, nanocatalysts
have increasingly attracted attention
in the development of chemical reactions under green reaction conditions.
Some of the progressive areas of green chemistry are the solvent-free
and microwave conditions used for various types of organic reactions
with nanocatalysts as heterogeneous catalysts. Metal oxides and, particularly,
bimetallic oxide nanoparticles have several applications including
as catalysts,1 photocatalysts,2 antimicrobial agents,3 materials with magnetic properties,4 and
CT-DNA binding agents.5 The most attractive
feature of nanoparticles lies in the field of green chemistry as they
serve as green catalysts in organic reactions and have advantages
such as easy separation from the reaction mixture by simple filtration,
reusability, recyclability, and environmental friendliness.6,7

Many conventional organic reactions need high temperatures
and
long reaction times. However, microwave (MW) irradiation techniques
accelerated the rate of organic reactions dramatically, and the reactions
were accomplished within a shorter reaction time. Owing to these attractive
features, microwave-assisted functional group transformations and
chemical synthesis gained tremendous interest in the field of green
and sustainable chemistry. On the other hand, avoiding toxic and volatile
organic solvents is the most acceptable practice in green chemical
synthesis, and accordingly, development of solvent-free reaction conditions
is a highly desirable process in terms of cost and environmental benefits.8−21

The Knoevenagel condensation is one of the most important
reactions
in organic synthesis involving C–C bond-forming reactions.
The applications of the Knoevenagel reaction are enormous, including
the synthesis of fine chemicals, anticoagulants, antibacterial agents,
fungicides, pesticides, etc.22−25 The Knoevenagal condensation is facilitated mainly
in the presence of bases, a catalyst such as piperidine, pyridine,
sodium ethoxide, and ammonia, and other organocatalysts.26 Some metal oxides also serve as catalysts in
the Knoevenagal condensation, such as ZrO2,27 TiO2,28,29 Fe3O4,30 NiO,31,32 and CuO.33,34 However, most of the reported
works have one or several drawbacks, such as the use of toxic organic
solvents, long reaction times, and nonseparable, nonrecyclable, expensive,
and toxic catalyst systems. Thus, it was desirable to develop an efficient
catalytic approach for the Knoevenagel condensation under green reaction
conditions. In continuation of our research work toward the development
of efficient multifunctional and recyclable catalysts, we wish to
report an ecofriendly and green protocol for the Knoevenagel condensation
using the bimetallic oxide, Y2ZnO4, as a nontoxic
nanocatalyst under microwave and solvent-free reaction conditions.

The efficiency of the nanocatalyst was further demonstrated by
the photocatalytic degradation of a dye, methyl orange (MO), under
green conditions. Pollutant dyes come from different sources, such
as textile, paper, cosmetic, and plastic industries, and so on.35−37 Non-biodegradable dyes can cause a variety of diseases, such as
skin rashes, allergies, and liver and kidney damage.38,39 Therefore, non-biodegradable dyes must be removed from drinking
water.

In this work, we synthesized the Y2ZnO4 nanocatalyst
using a simple coprecipitation method, and it was characterized by
X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). The nanoparticles were used as a photocatalyst against
methyl orange (MO) and as a catalyst to perform the Knoevenagel reaction
between aromatic aldehydes with active methylene compounds, such as
ethyl cyanoacetate and malononitrile, under solvent-free, microwave
(MW) conditions.

Green Context
Bimetallic oxide Y2ZnO4 was used as a nontoxic and recyclable nanocatalyst
in both
Knoevenagel condensation and photocatalytic dye degradation under
green conditions. The use of microwave (MW) radiation dramatically
enhanced the reaction rate, and the Knoevenagel reaction was accomplished
in a shorter reaction time with high conversion and selectivity under
solvent-free conditions. The described methodology has several advantages
over conventional methods because in this green approach, the nanocatalyst
is easily separable and recoverable from the product. This approach
avoided the use of toxic organic solvents, and there was no formation
of byproducts as waste in the Knoevenagel condensation. Moreover,
degradation of the pollutant dye, methyl orange, was carried out using
the nanoparticles as the catalyst by following the concept of green
chemistry in the presence of sunlight.

Results and Discussion
XRD Analysis
The XRD technique was used to determine
and confirm the crystal structure of Y2ZnO4.
The intense diffraction peaks observed at 34.63, 36.48, 37.90, 45.88,
58.30, and 63.25° were indexed to the (100), (002), (101), (102),
(110), and (103) planes, respectively,3 as shown in Figure 1. The crystallite size of Y2ZnO4 was 17 ±
1 nm, measured using the Scherrer method.

Figure 1 XRD pattern of Y2ZnO4.

SEM and EDX Analysis
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
studies were performed on Y2ZnO4 to gain information
about the grain size. Figure 2 represents the SEM images of Y2ZnO4 at different resolutions. The SEM images show that the nanomaterials
are rod-shaped, paddy-seed-like particles and that they are arranged
in a well-ordered manner, with the average grain size of the nanoparticles
being 10 ± 2 nm. The elemental description of the sample was
obtained from energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and the % elemental
composition is shown in Figure S1 and Table S1. The peaks located at 1 and 2 keV are directly related to the characteristics
of zinc and yttrium.

Figure 2 SEM image of Y2ZnO4 at different
resolutions.

FT-IR Analysis
The FT-IR spectrum of Y2ZnO4 is presented in Figure S2. The
band observed at about 3436 cm–1 was characteristic
of the H–O bending mode of the hydroxyl groups present on the
surface due to moisture. The peak appearing at about 675 cm–1 was due to the bending vibration of the Zn–O bond.25b

Knoevenagel Condensation Using Y2ZnO4 as
the Nanocatalyst
The optimization of the Knoevenagel condensation
was performed using commercially available benzaldehyde 1a and ethyl cyanoacetate 2a in the presence of the synthesized
nanocatalyst, Y2ZnO4.

Initially, we carried
out the Knoevenagel reaction under solvent-free conditions at room
temperature using 10 mol % Y2ZnO4 nanocatalyst
and detected the formation of the Knoevenagel condensation product, 3a, as observed from the 1H NMR spectrum of the
crude reaction mixture. However, at room temperature, the reaction
was not completed after 5 h and the yield of the reaction was found
to be poor (Table 1, entry 1). With this encouraging result, we carried out the optimization
of the Knoevenagel condensation using Y2ZnO4 as the nanocatalyst and screened various reaction conditions, such
as room temperature, catalyst loading, solvent-free conditions, effect
of solvents, and conventional heating, followed by the effect of microwave
(MW) radiation. The optimization results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. When the reaction was performed at 70 °C, the yield
of the condensation product 3a was improved to 56% using
the same catalyst loading under solvent-free conditions (Table 1, entry 2). The Knoevenagel
product, 3a, was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopic
data and comparison with literature data.40−45 A decrease in reaction yield was noted when we performed the reaction
using a lower catalyst loading (Table 1, entry 3). Next, we studied the effect of solvent
on the catalytic reaction in the presence of 10 mol % nanocatalyst
(Y2ZnO4). It was observed that the yield of
product 3a was found to be better in ethanol and methanol
(Table 1, entries 7
and 11) than in other solvents under heating conditions. However,
conventional heating was found to be very slow and the reaction was
not completed even after 5 h. To improve the efficiency of the Knoevenagel
reaction and yield of 3a, we exploited the microwave
(MW) effect on the catalytic reaction using the nanocatalyst (Y2ZnO4). In recent years, microwave-assisted synthesis
has become highly attractive and useful for the development of green
and sustainable processes.8 Subsequently,
we further optimized the reaction under microwave irradiation, employing
the same nanocatalyst (10 mol % Y2ZnO4) under
solvent-free conditions. The optimization of the Knoevenagel reaction
under microwave irradiation is shown in Table 2. When the reaction mixture was irradiated
at 140 W, within a short period of time, the formation of 3a was observed and the NMR yield was found to be 70% (Table 2, entry 1).

%, 0.044 mmol, 13.6 mg) at room temperature (RT).

Unless otherwise
mentioned, the reaction was carried out with benzaldehyde 1a (0.530 mmol, 56.2 mg), ethyl cyanoacetate 2 (0.442

%, 0.044 mmol, 13.6 mg) under microwave (MW) and solvent-free conditions.

b Yield of 3a was
determined
by 1H NMR analysis.

A variation in reaction yield was observed when the microwave irradiation
power was varied. The reaction was found to be completed within 15
min when the microwave irradiation power was increased to 420 W, and
the yield was increased to 92% (Table 2, entry 3). The effect of microwave irradiation power
on the yield of 3a is depicted in Figure 3. Under the same reaction conditions, the
yield of 3a was decreased when the reaction time was
reduced to 10 min (Table 2, entry 4). Similarly, a reduced yield of 3a was
observed when the catalyst loading was increased to 20 mol % (Table 2, entry 5). Under
microwave irradiation, we achieved the best reaction condition at
420 W in the presence of 10 mol % nanocatalyst under solvent-free
conditions (Table 2, entry 3). The effect of microwave irradiation power on the yield
of 3a was studied, and we observed that the yield of 3a was increased by increasing the microwave power, as depicted
in Figure 3.

irradiation power on the yield of product 3a.

After the optimization of the reaction and determination
of the
best reaction condition using Y2ZnO4 as the
nanocatalyst under microwave and solvent-free conditions, as shown
in Table 2, entry 3,
we next evaluated the scope and efficiency of the Knoevenagel condensation.
Under the optimized condition, a range of aromatic carbonyl compounds 1 reacted smoothly with ethyl cyanoacetate 2a (R3 = CO2Et) and afforded
the corresponding Knoevenagel condensation products (3a–l) with up to 92% yield within a short period of time (Table 3).

a Reaction conditions: Unless otherwise
mentioned, the reaction was carried out with aromatic aldehyde 1 (0.530 mmol, 56.2 mg), ethyl cyanoacetate 2 (0.442 mmol, 50 mg), and nanocatalyst Y2ZnO4 (10 mol %, 0.044 mmol, 13.6 mg) under MW (420 W) and solvent-free
conditions.

c Yield of 3 was
determined
by 1H NMR analysis.

No significant difference in the rate of reaction was found between
various aromatic aldehydes containing electron-withdrawing and electron-donating
groups under our reaction conditions. However, an aromatic ketone,
such as benzophenone, reacted with a comparatively slower reaction
rate to afford the corresponding Knoevenagel product, 3h (Table 3, entry 8).
Under microwave conditions, heteroaromatic aldehyde furfural also
reacted efficiently with ethyl cyanoacetate and afforded product 3i via the Knoevenagel condensation, as shown in Table 3, entry 9. Next, the
substrate scope of the reaction was further evaluated using malononitrile
as the active methylene compound. Under the optimized condition, aromatic
carbonyl compounds reacted smoothly with malononitrile and afforded
the corresponding Knoevenagel condensation products (3j–l) within a short period of time, as shown in Table 3 (entries 10–12). The structure of
all products (3a–l) was determined by 1H NMR data and comparison with literature data.40−44 Compared to the reported methods, our method under
microwave conditions is environmentally friendly and has several advantages
including a short reaction time and solvent-free conditions with excellent
conversion and yields. Moreover, the reaction does not require any
additive or activators and the nanocatalyst used in the reaction is
easily recoverable and recyclable.

Reusability of Nanocatalyst
Y2ZnO4
After completion of the first
run, diethyl ether was added to the
reaction mixture and nanocatalyst Y2ZnO4 was
recovered by simple filtration. The recovered catalyst was washed
repeatedly with diethyl ether and dried at 100 °C in a hot air
oven for reuse. The recyclability of the catalyst was studied for
the Knoevenagel condensation under the optimized reaction condition.
The catalyst recovered in the first run was reused in two more subsequent
runs without any appreciable loss of catalytic activity (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Recycling of nanocatalyst
Y2ZnO4 in the Knoevenagel
condensation.

Before and after the catalytic
reaction, we studied the morphology
of the Y2ZnO4 nanoparticle using SEM. After
the reaction, the morphology was slightly changed, as shown in Figure 5; however, no loss
of appreciable catalytic activity was observed in the subsequent runs.
This is due to the high stability of nanocatalyst Y2ZnO4 under our reaction conditions.

reaction.

Mechanistic Pathway of
the Knoevenagel Reaction
According
to the literature6 and based on the above
experimental facts, a possible reaction mechanism of the Knoevenagel
reaction catalyzed by nanocatalyst Y2ZnO4 under
microwave (MW) conditions is proposed in Scheme 1. In the first step, benzaldehyde 1a is activated by forming a complex between the carbonyl oxygen and
the nanocatalyst. After that, the activated aldehyde complex 4 is attacked by the active methylene compound, ethyl cyanoacetate,
generating an intermediate 5. Intermediate 5 is then protonated and activated by the nanocatalyst through coordination
with a hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of complex 6. The elimination of water from intermediate 6 subsequently
affords the corresponding product 3a. The high catalytic
activity observed in this reaction is probably due to the large surface
area of the nanoparticles.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for the Knoevenagel Condensation
Catalyzed by
Y2ZnO4
Photocatalytic Activity
The photocatalytic activity
of nanocatalyst Y2ZnO4 against different types
of organic dyes, such as methyl orange (MO), methylene blue (MB),
naphthol orange (NO), and congo red (CR), was studied in the presence
of sunlight. The efficiency of a catalyst for the degradation of a
dye is defined in terms of C/C0, where C and C0 represent the final and initial concentrations of the dye (Figure 6a). Among all dyes,
MO was degraded faster compared with the other dyes and completely
decolourized within 65 min in the presence of nanoparticles and sunlight
(Figure 6a), whereas
the other dyes, MB, NO, and CR, were not degraded. This is due to
the lower energy band gap (2.7 eV) of nanocatalyst Y2ZnO4 calculated from optical spectra. According to Beer–Lambert’s
law, the concentration of MO is linearly proportional to the intensity
of the absorption peak of MO at 463 nm, and the efficiency of the
nanocatalyst for degradation of MO can be calculated using the following eq 1 1  where At and A0 are the absorbance of
the dye at time t and at the initial time, respectively.
The degradation
efficiency of nanocatalyst Y2ZnO4 is about 78.5%
against MO and the corresponding rate constant (k) is about 3.939 × 10–4 s–1. The absorption spectra of methyl orange at a constant time interval
were investigated and are shown in Figure 6b. The optical band gap was calculated according
to our previous publication.46 The optical
band gap value was 2.7 eV, which was supported by a literature review.3 The proposed mechanism pathway for the degradation
of MO in the presence of the nanocatalyst and sunlight is shown in Figure 7.

dyes by the nanocatalyst as a normalized

Conclusions
In
the above experiment, we synthesized a nanocatalyst Y2ZnO4 by a simple coprecipitation method. Nanocatalyst
Y2ZnO4 has excellent dual catalytic activity;
one of them is in the Knoevenagel reaction under microwave and solvent-free
conditions to afford a range of substituted alkenes and the other
one is as a photocatalyst for the degradation of MO. The reported
method for the Knoevenagel reaction is commercially highly interesting
because of several advantages, including mild reaction conditions,
a green process, easy recovery and reusability of the catalyst, excellent
yields, short reaction times, and an ecofriendly approach. The photocatalytic
activity of Y2ZnO4 helps degrade the dye molecules
and reduces harmful pollutants from the environment. Antimicrobial
activity and other applications of Y2ZnO4 will
be studied in further work.

Experimental Section
Materials and Apparatus
All required chemicals were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck. All chemicals were used without
purification.

The Knoevenagel reaction was performed under microwave
conditions. The microwave synthesis was carried out using a domestic
microwave oven (2450 MHz, 1050 W) in a screw cap glass tube. The crystal
structure of Y2ZnO4 was studied by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) at room temperature using a D8 Advance Bruker, equipped with
Cu Kα (1.54060 Å) as the incident radiation. The Scherrer
equation was used for the calculation of crystal size. The Scherrer
equation is D = Kλ/β cos θ, K = 0.9, D = crystal size (Å), λ
= wavelength of Cu Kα radiation, and β = corrected half-width
of the diffraction peak. The IR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu
FTIR-8400S spectrometer at room temperature. The fine structure of
the prepared samples was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (Carl Zeiss Germany, Model Supra-40). Energy-dispersion X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) of nanoparticles was performed on a Sigma ZEISS,
Oxford Instruments field emission microscope. The 1H NMR
spectra were recorded on a JEOL-400 MHz spectrometer using chloroform-D
(CDCl3) as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an
internal standard. The chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative
to TMS at δ 0.00 ppm. 1H NMR splitting patterns are
designated as singlet (s), broad singlet (br. s), doublet (d), triplet
(t), quartet (q), or multiplet (m).

Synthesis of Nanocatalyst
Y2ZnO4
The total synthesis of the nanocatalyst
was carried out by a coprecipitation
method. Y(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved
in a minimum volume of distilled water (set-1). ZnO was also dissolved
in minimum amounts of water and dil. HCl (set-2). Now, 20 mL of C2H5OH was added into set-1, and it was poured into
set-2 with constant stirring with a magnetic stirrer for 30 min. A
clear solution was obtained; then, NH4OH was added dropwise
to maintain the pH (8–9), and a white gelatinous precipitate
was produced, which was filtered. The precipitate washed with water
and dried at about 600 °C for 2 h. The yield was 81.7% with respect
to the starting materials.

General Procedure for the Knoevenagel Condensation
Using Y2ZnO4 as the Nanocatalyst
A
mixture of
benzaldehyde 1a (0.530 mmol, 56.2 mg), ethyl cyanoacetate 2 (0.442 mmol, 50 mg), and Y2ZnO4 nanopowder
(10 mol %, 0.044 mmol, 13.6 mg) was taken in a screw cap glass tube
and subjected to microwave irradiation at 420 W. The reaction was
monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using 10% ethyl acetate
in n-hexane. After 15 min, the reaction was found
to be completed. Then, the glass tube was cooled and diluted with
diethyl ether (5 mL). The catalyst was separated by filtration. The
catalyst was washed thoroughly with diethyl ether (5 mL) and dried
in a hot air oven for reuse. The combined ether was evaporated to
dryness to obtain the crude product. The yield of the product was
determined from the 1H NMR analysis of the crude reaction
mixture. The yield of product 3a was found to be 92%
(Table 3, entry 1).
All products shown in Table 3 were synthesized according to the above procedure and were
confirmed by 1H NMR spectral data and comparison with literature
data (see the Supporting Information).

Dye Degradation
Rhodamine B (RB), methyl orange (MO),
naphthyl orange (NO), and methylene blue (MB) were separately dissolved
in water. Then, 10 mg of the nanocatalyst was soaked in 10 mL of dye
solution and kept in sunlight. Furthermore, we examined the specific
photocatalytic activity, and readings from the UV spectrometer were
taken regularly.
