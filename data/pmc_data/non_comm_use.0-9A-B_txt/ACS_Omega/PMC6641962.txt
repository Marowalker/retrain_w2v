Catalysts
of iron oxide on γ-alumina and silica which were
prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation technique have been
investigated in an effort to understand how the surface chemical properties
are influenced by the nature of the supports. Surprisingly, this is
the first study to compare in depth the influence of the supports
on physicochemical parameters such as acidity, site nuclearity, and
reducibility. In this study, surface characterisation techniques including
N2 physisorption at −196 °C, ammonia temperature-programmed
desorption, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry,
temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen, CO-chemisorption,
scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and
NO adsorption by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy have
been performed to understand the different surface reactions occurring
over the two different supports. The aim of this study is to ascertain
the primary differences between these two catalysts using several
catalyst characterization techniques and correlate their chemical
and structural differences to their catalytic activity in the conversion
of 2-chlorophenol. The results disclose a higher density of acid sites,
a smaller particle size of iron oxide, stabilization of Fe(II) aluminate
after reduction on the alumina surface, and finally, the formation
of isolated iron cations on the surface of alumina which are notably
absent on the silica-supported catalyst.

==== Body
Introduction
Iron exists in several
oxidation states in the environment. Different
phases of iron, such as hematite, magnetite, and goethite (either
in their pure forms or supported on carbon, alumina, silica, and zeolite)
have been used as catalysts, for a myriad of commercially significant
chemical reactions. Iron oxide on various supports has gained particular
attention for catalysis applications because of its use in reactions
such as Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, synthesis of NH3, and the water gas shift reaction.1−4 However, these catalysts have also been
reported to catalyze the formation of a dangerous group of pollutants:
polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated
dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs, dioxins) under certain conditions where carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine (especially a precursor molecule such
as chlorophenol) are present in the reacting environment.5−8

In general, the type and structure of the support, method
of preparation,
and active site loading (e.g., iron percentage) are considered important
factors that influence the catalyst’s redox properties and
particle size, which in turn has a strong influence on the activity
and selectivity of the supported catalysts.9−19 In addition to these variables, the support used is likely to play
a vital role in the properties of the metal-supported catalyst. Thyssen
et al.,20 Zahaf et al.,21 Borgmann et al.,12 and Tanaka
et al.22 all studied copper/nickel (Cu/Ni),
platinum (Pt), cobalt (Co), and vanadium (V) catalysts over alumina
and silica. Thyssen et al.20 reported stronger
interactions of metal support with γ-alumina compared to those
supported on silica and noted formation of CuO and NiO on the surface
of both supports and formation of an additional species, NiAl2O4, on the surface of γ-alumina support;
Zahaf et al.21 showed different abundances
of Pt species on the surface of alumina and silica; Borgmann et al.12 detected Co3O4 species
on the surface of silica and CoO and CoAl2O4 species on the surface of γ-alumina, and finally, Tanaka et
al.22 reported the tetrahedral structure
of V on the γ-alumina support and square pyramidal on the silica
support.

It has been established that a relationship exists
between the
particle size of metal oxides and the pore diameter of the support.
Storsæter et al.23 studied the particle
size and dispersion of cobalt (Co0) and Co3O4 on different supports (γ-alumina, silica, and titania)
via H2-chemisorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively,
and reported an increase in the particle size of the same order of
magnitude as the average pore diameter of the supports. Similar findings
were reported by Jean-Marie et al.,24 who
found that clusters of Co3O4 particles reduced
in size formed on supports with a reduced pore diameter.

With
reference to the current available literature, there does
not appear to be a comprehensive study of iron catalysts on γ-alumina
and silica supports, prepared by the method of incipient wetness.
Only a limited body of literature exists on the relationship between
the iron oxide particle size and its dispersion on alumina and silica
supports. Some studies have been undertaken to investigate the effect
of the support used on the properties of oxidic iron particles. For
example, Wan et al.25 reported for amorphous
silica alumina that increasing the alumina/silica ratio enhances the
size of Fe2O3 crystals and the nature of the
Fe–SiO2 interaction, with the consequence that the
Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 reduction
reaction shifts to higher temperatures. Braga et al.26 observed a reduction in the particle size of Fe2O3 on the surface of alumina than on the silica support.
Park et al.11 reported a limited reduction
of larger particles of Fe2O3 on the surface
of alumina because of the smaller contact area of the metal with the
support. A number of techniques have been used to characterize the
size and nature of the surface sites of transition metal-containing
compounds. They include electron microscopy, XRD, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy27,28 to gain information on the size and structure (and also limited
information about the chemical nature) of transition-metal sites.
The chemical nature, dispersion, and also some structural information
can be obtained by adsorption and desorption techniques. Nitric oxide29−35 alone (or sometimes in combination with other adsorbates, particularly
carbon monoxide36−39) is widely applied as a probe molecule to study the oxidation and
coordination state of surface cations.

In our previous studies,6,7,40,41 we examined the catalytic conversion
of 2-chlorophenol (2-CPh, a dioxin precursor) on iron oxide deposited
on the surface of γ-alumina and silica. We observed that the
conversion of 2-CPh to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), dioxins,
and total oxidation products differs significantly on the surface
of γ-alumina-supported iron oxide compared to silica-supported
iron oxide. On the surface of the former catalyst, we consumed approximately
10 times more 2-CPh and were unable to detect any feed at the outlet
of the reactor for the first 3 h, during which we observed CO2, CO, HCl, and chlorobenzenes. After the first 3 h, the catalyst
changed color from orange to black, and we observed the feed and chlorinated
phenols in the outlet of the reactor. The yield of dioxins increased
dramatically once the color change was observed. However, 2-CPh conversion
on the surface of silica-supported iron oxide resulted in VOCs, dioxins,
and oxidation products from the first hour with a very low concentration
of the feed (50 ppm).

In another paper,42 we used two techniques
of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (in situ-FTIR) and
XPS to further study the catalysts’ behavior in these particular
reactions. In summary, we found that dioxin precursors (chlorophenolate/chlorophenoxy
compounds) were formed on the surface of silica-supported iron oxide
from the beginning of the experiment at very low pressures (0.01 μbar)
of 2-CPh, but over alumina-supported iron oxide, we observed the formation
of coke and formate species on the surface. As soon as active sites
on the catalyst were masked by oxidation products, dioxin precursors
were detected. XPS analysis of fresh catalysts revealed a higher surface
coverage of iron on the surface of alumina compared to the silica,
despite containing the same concentration of iron in the bulk of the
two supports. This indicates that oxidic iron species are present
in smaller clusters on the alumina surface compared to the silica
support. It was also found that significantly more carbon accumulated
on the surface of the spent alumina-supported iron oxide compared
to the spent silica-supported iron oxide. An additional chlorine species
was also found on the surface of the spent alumina-supported iron
oxide which can be specified as either metal chloride or a HCl bond.
Finally, reduction of iron(III) is evident in the all spent catalysts.

In the current study, we aimed to correlate the structural and
chemical properties of iron oxide on silica and γ-alumina to
their catalytic activity in the conversion of 2-CPh. To understand
more about the physical and chemical properties of the iron oxide
on silica and γ-alumina supports, other characterization techniques
such as N2 adsorption, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption
(NH3-TPD), inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometry (ICP–OES), temperature-programmed reduction with
hydrogen (H2-TPR), CO-chemisorption, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and NO-FTIR
analyses were applied.

Results and Discussion
N2 Adsorption
Table 1 lists the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area (m2 g–1), average
pore volume (cm3 g–1), and average pore
diameter (nm) obtained by N2 adsorption at −196
°C for γ-alumina, silica, and iron oxide on γ-alumina
and on silica catalysts. Typical nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms
are presented in Figures S2–S5 of the Supporting Information. The isotherms for the samples are type 4 which
is indicative of either nonporous adsorbents or adsorbents having
relatively large pores.

Table 1 BET Surface Area,
Average Pore Volume,
and Average Pore Diameter
oxide sample	surface area (m2 g–1)	BJH adsorption pore volume (cm3 g–1)	BJH average pore diameter (nm)	
γ-alumina	191	0.47	9.4	
silica	229	1.0	15.4	
iron oxide on γ-alumina	168	0.42	9.4	
iron oxide on silica	218	0.95	15.1	
According to Table 1, it was determined that the silica and silica-supported iron oxide
samples had a larger average pore diameter compared to the alumina
and alumina-supported iron oxide samples. In addition, the pore volume
of the silica and silica-supported iron oxide catalysts was significantly
higher than that of the alumina and alumina-supported iron oxide catalysts.
Similar observations have been reported for cobalt oxide supported
on γ-alumina and silica.12

Acidic
Properties of the Catalysts
Figure 1 presents the NH3-TPD profiles
of all catalysts. The profiles of alumina-supported
and silica-supported iron oxide were already published in our previous
paper42 and are included here to compare
with the data of the alumina and silica supports. Hall et al.43−45 have expressed the total acidity of catalysis in terms of extensive
and intensive factors. Extensive factors represent the total number
of acid sites and intensive factors indicate the strength of the individual
sites. Peak areas in the different temperature regions indicate the
relative concentration of acid sites on the surface of the catalysts
(extensive factor), and the maximum peak temperature signifies the
relative strength of the acid site (intensive factor). The classification
of the acid site strength is defined as follows: weak sites (150–300
°C), medium strength sites (300–500 °C), and strong
acid sites (greater than 500 °C).46 The γ-alumina support displays a considerably higher concentration
of acidic sites compared to silica, at least in terms of weak and
medium acidity strength regions. However, the strength of acid sites
is higher in the silica support. Ammonia desorbed at temperatures
of 300 and 541 °C from the surface of silica and at temperatures
of 215 and 470 °C from the surface of alumina. Further, the higher
intensity of the modified alumina and silica indicates that iron oxide
enhances the concentration of weak and medium acid sites. Table 2 presents the quantities
of acid sites of the γ-alumina, silica, and iron oxide on γ-alumina
and silica catalysts.

and

Temperature-Programmed Reduction with Hydrogen
The
reduction behavior of the two silica-supported and alumina-supported
iron oxide catalysts was studied by H2-TPR. Figure 2 presents the reduction profiles
of these two catalysts. In the case of the silica-supported iron oxide
catalyst, we observed three distinct stages of reduction.47−49 The first reduction region contains two partially overlapping peaks.
The peaks at 385 and 438 °C can be ascribed to the transformations
of Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 and Fe3O4 → FeO, respectively. The
third peak at 608 °C can be attributed to the transformation
of FeO → Fe. However, for the alumina-supported iron oxide
catalyst, we observed a two-stage reduction profile, a peak with a
shoulder. The shoulder at 275 °C can be assigned to Fe2O3 → Fe3O4, and the peak
at 370 °C can be attributed to Fe3O4 →
FeO or Fe(II) aluminate (FeAl2O4).50 It is apparent that this structure was stabilized,51 and reduction of Fe(II) to Fe metal was not
taking place. Reduction of Fe(III) on the silica support occurs at
higher temperatures compared to the one on the alumina support. This
can be due to different particle sizes of oxidic iron species and
different interactions between iron oxide particles with the two supports.52−54

iron oxide.

ICP–OES and CO-Chemisorption
Table 3 compares
the Fe loading, (the
sum of the bulk and surface iron atoms) of the catalysts based on
ICP–OES analysis and provides an estimation of the concentration
of accessible iron sites (from CO-chemisorption experiments on the
surface of the modified alumina and silica).

CO Chemisorption, Fe Dispersion,
and Fe Average Diameter

iron oxide
on γ-alumina	3.3	16.3	6.2	
iron oxide
on silica	3.2	4.27	1.95	
The dispersion of iron
on the surface of silica (1.95%) is less
than that determined for the surface of alumina (6.2%). Particle agglomeration
on the surface of silica compared to the alumina and the reducibility
of iron on the two supports provide possible explanations for this
difference. CO chemisorbed much better on the reduced form of iron.55−57 The catalysts were reduced under a flow of H2 at 450
°C prior to CO-chemisorption experiments. The color of reduced
alumina-supported iron oxide changed to greenish, which most likely
represents the transformation of the Fe3+ to Fe2+ species. However, a black color observed for silica-supported iron
oxide appears to represent a combination of Fe3+ and Fe2+ species on the catalyst.

SEM and TEM
SEM
and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) served
to study the morphology and elemental distribution of iron on each
of the supports. Figures S6 and S7 in the Supporting Information offer a typical SEM micrograph and an example of
EDX elemental mapping. From the SEM image, it is evident that particles
of iron oxide supported on the silica are on average larger in diameter
when compared to those on the alumina support. The alumina support
consists of various agglomerated, relatively small diameter particles
of a nearly spherical shape. Moreover, alumina contains smaller pores
compared to the silica catalyst. EDX analysis was employed to determine
the chemical compositions of silica-supported and alumina-supported
iron oxide (Figures S5 and S6, part c). TEM images and the particle size
distributions are shown in Figure 3. The lighter regions in the images are composed primarily
of the support, while the darker regions are iron particles. The majority
of iron oxide particles on alumina and silica supports are in the
range of 0.4–2 and 6–8 nm, respectively, as estimated
statistically from the TEM data. TEM also confirmed agglomerated and
larger particle sizes of iron oxide on the surface of the silica support.
The size of iron oxide particles on the surface can be explained by
considering the point of zero charge (PZC) of the two supports and
the pH of the impregnating solution. The PZC of silica and γ-alumina
are well-established in the literature, and these values range between
1.7 to 4.5 and 7 to 9,58−60 respectively. This is consistent with the published
PZC and NH3-TPD profiles of the supports (see Figure 1); PZC is related
to the extensive factor of catalyst acidity, and higher density of
acid sites was measured on the surface of alumina compared to the
silica support. We used an iron(III) nitrate solution with a pH of
1.0 ± 0.2 for preparing the silica-supported and alumina-supported
iron oxide by the incipient wetness method. Because the pH of the
solution was lower than PZC of the two supports, the surface of the
two adsorbents was positively charged. However, the surface of alumina
is more positive and enhanced by the electrostatic repulsive force,
suppresses the agglomeration, and subsequently reduces hydrodynamic
size of clusters.61,62 This explanation is in good agreement
with the smaller clusters measured, and even isolated cations on the
surface of alumina (vide infra) were disclosed. In addition, a higher
level of iron dispersion was observed on the alumina surface compared
to the silica surface with 6.2 and 1.95%, respectively, as measured
by CO-chemisorption (see Table 3).

iron oxide and (c) histogram plot of particle size distribution for

NO-FTIR
NO adsorption on catalyst
surfaces, in combination
with FTIR spectroscopy, is widely used for the characterization of
iron species. According to the literature, NO adsorbs more strongly
on Fe2+ sites in comparison with Fe3+ sites.63

NO Adsorption on Unmodified γ-Alumina
Support
The infrared spectra, corresponding to NO adsorption
on the surface
of alumina, as recorded at 30 °C, are presented in Figure 4. Bands in the range of 1250–1620
cm–1 have previously been denoted as strongly adsorbed
nitrito complexes, nitrite (NO2–), and
nitrate (NO3–) species, on an alumina
surface.64−70 At very low pressures of NO (less than 1 μbar), several bands
at 1231, 1320, 1350, and 1467 cm–1 were observed
(see Figure 4b). According
to previous studies on the adsorption of NO gas on the surface of
alumina, the bands at 1231 and 1320 cm–1 can be
assigned to a bridged nitrite species,66,71 while the
bands at 1350 and 1467 cm–1 have been attributed
to bidentate and monodentate nitrite species bonded to aluminium atoms,
respectively.66,70,72,73 Increasing NO coverage results in the appearance
and an increase in the intensity of several new bands at 1260, 1294,
1310, 1558, 1591, and 1620 cm–1. Similar results
have been reported from studies on the adsorption of NO2 gas on γ-alumina.67,73−77

Figure 4 (a)

alumina at 30 °C, (b) IR spectra in the range of 1200–1700
cm–1, the numbers correspond to NO adsorption at
low coverage on the surface, and (c) IR spectra in the range of 3200–3800
cm–1.

On the basis of assignments reported, in the adsorption of
NO2 on the surface of γ-alumina, bands can be attributed
to three types of nitrate species as follows: (i) monodentate (1558
and 1310 cm–1), (ii) bidentate (1591 and 1294 cm–1), and (iii) bridged nitrate (1620 and 1260 cm–1) species.74,78Scheme 1 presents the possible conformation of NOx species during adsorption of NO on alumina.
Nitrite species are formed at low NO gas coverages, and nitrate species
increase in concentration as the pressure of NO increases. The reaction
of labile surface oxygen originating from alumina has been postulated
as a reason for the formation of nitrate species. The nitrate species
were suggested to be formed from NO2.65 It is also possible that, as depicted in reactions 1 and 2, NO2 and
N2O arise in the gas phase at elevated pressures of NO
gas because of disproportionation. The formation of the absorption
bands on the catalyst suggests that the reactions 3 and 4 occur on the surface of the catalyst. 1   2   3   4  

Scheme 1 Structure of Various NOx Species on Alumina
According to the published literature,79 the band at 2234 cm–1 can be assigned
to an N≡N
stretching mode of N2O. Adsorbed N2O exhibits
a blue shift in comparison with the infrared spectra of gaseous N2O.80 As presented in Figure 4, the intensity of the absorption
band at 1961 cm–1 increased with the increasing
NOx coverage. This band can be assigned
to an adsorbed N2O3 species. The IR frequencies
of N2O3 are widely documented with characteristic
absorption bands at approximately 1950, 1300, and 1570 cm–1. The two bands at 1300 and 1570 cm–1 are a combination
of N2O3 stretching vibration bands overlapping
the bands of adsorbed nitrate species.

Absorption bands of a
nitrosonium (NO+) on the surface
of alumina are characterized by the appearance of the absorption bands
at 2264 cm–1.

The appearance of negative bands
within the 3650–3800 cm–1 region indicates
the interaction of isolated hydroxyl
groups on the surface of alumina with NOx. Five different bands at 3690, 3733, 3757, 3773, and 3791 cm–1 can be assigned to five different hydroxyl groups
with different coordination geometries. The most prominent band at
3733 cm–1 is attributed to hydroxyls groups which
are bound to two octahedrally coordinated Al3+ sites, present
in a bridging configuration. The shoulder around 3690 cm–1 and the band at 3791 cm–1 are associated with
hydroxyl groups bound to three and a single Al3+ sites
with octahedral coordination, respectively. The two remaining features
at 3773 and 3757 cm–1 are assigned to the terminal
hydroxyl groups adsorbed on a single Al3+ site with a tetrahedral
coordination that can exist on two different crystallographic orientations
[i.e., (111) and (110)] of the surface of δ-Al2O3.69,77,81

NO Adsorption
on Unmodified Silica Support
The IR spectra
of NO adsorption on the surface of silica are presented in Figure 5. It is readily observed
that the concentration of NO on the surface is much lower on silica
compared to the alumina support. Note that the thickness of the solid
wafers is very similar. A series of studies reported low adsorption
energy of NO and N2 on the surface of silica.36,80,82,83 In addition to the bands at 1480, 1525, and 1731 cm–1, the remaining features are possibly a result of relatively weak
adsorption of NOx on silica.

Figure 5 IR spectra
of adsorbed NO on the surface of vacuum-treated silica
at 30 °C.

According to the literature,
the absorption band at 1480 cm–1 is attributed to
monodentate nitrates and 1525 cm–1 is in the range
of bidentate nitrate.72,80 Kugler et al.84 assigned the bands at
1745 and 1875 cm–1 to adsorbed cis NO dimer (NO)2 during the adsorption of nitric oxide on silica-supported
chromium, and in another study by Ghiotti et al.,85 the single band at 1740 cm–1 was attributed
to the adsorbed trans NO dimer (NO)2. Moreover, Djonev
et al.86 assigned the band at 1744 cm–1 to weakly adsorbed N2O4 when
studying the adsorption of NO2 on silica-supported cobalt
oxide. This species could form through NO2 dimerization,
as discussed previously.

The appearances of negative bands in
3743 cm–1 indicate the interaction of isolated hydroxyl
groups on the surface
of silica with NOx.

NO Adsorption
on Alumina-Supported Iron Oxide Catalysts
The IR spectra
of NO adsorbed on supports (alumina and silica) are
recorded, in an effort to differentiate bands that are formed because
of the chemisorption of NO on the oxidic iron species (see Figures 6 and 7). Intense bands at 1816 and 1823 cm–1 are
evident, and the spectral region between 1800 and 1860 cm–1 is attributed to the formation of adsorbed nitrosyl species on reduced
Fe sites.

Figure 6 IR spectra of adsorbed NO on the surface of vacuum-treated alumina-supported
iron oxide at 30 °C.

Figure 7 IR spectra of adsorbed NO on the surface of vacuum-treated silica-supported
iron oxide at 30 °C.

Figure 6 presents
the adsorption of NO gas on the surface of alumina-supported iron
oxide. Importantly, it is well-documented that NO does not adsorb
strongly on Fe3+ sites; thus, the peak around 1816 cm–1 reflects bond formation between Fe2+ and
NO. The formation of an Fe2+ cation originates from auto-reduction
of the iron species; a similar phenomenon has been reported elsewhere.87 At very low concentrations of NO, a new spectral
feature at approximately 1816 cm–1 is observed.
Increasing the pressure of NO to a level greater than 1 mbar caused
an apparent shift of this band to higher wavenumbers. Concomitant
with this blue shift, we observe the appearance of nitrate (1250–1620
cm–1) and N2O3 bands (1959
cm–1).

NO Adsorption on Silica-Supported Iron Oxide
Catalysts
The IR spectra of NO adsorption on the surface
of silica-supported
iron oxide are illustrated in Figure 7. The adsorption of NO on Fe2+ species appears
at higher wavenumbers and at a notably decreased intensity compared
to alumina-supported catalysts. At low coverage of NO, a band at 1823
cm–1 appeared and, similar to NO adsorption on oxidic
iron on alumina, increasing NO coverage resulted in a blue shift of
the band to a higher wavenumber (1852 cm–1).

At low coverages, NO adsorbs on highly reactive, coordinatively unsaturated
Fe2+ species. However, increasing NO coverage results in
the formation and co-existence of NO and NO2 surface species.
Kayhan et al.88 reported the decomposition
of NO2 gas on Fe2+/Fe(3–x)+ sites, producing a surface oxygen atom and oxidizing
the reduced iron in the vicinity of the oxygen species. Thus, by increasing
NO coverage, the band indicative of reduced Fe sites decreases in
intensity and shifts to higher wavenumbers. To understand the nature
of these differences, we selected the spectrum obtained at 10 μbar
pressure to perform peak deconvolution of distinct surface species
assuming a Gaussian peak shape, in the range between 1750 and 1900
cm–1. Four species for the alumina-supported iron
oxide (with maxima at 1783, 1807, 1825, and 1841 cm–1) and three for the silica-supported iron oxide (with maxima at 1790,
1805, and 1825 cm–1) were fitted. The results are
presented in Table 4.

iron oxide and (b) silica-supported iron oxide.

On the basis of the curve-fitting analysis, alumina induces
an
increased number of Fe2+ sites available to NO adsorption
compared to silica, most likely because of the existence of isolated
Fe2+ species on the alumina-supported catalyst and the
larger dispersion of the adsorption sites (iron) on the alumina-supported
surface compared to the silica-supported catalyst.

Indeed, this
conclusion is consistent with the results of the investigation
by Chen et al.89 who studied the dispersion
of Fe2O3 on the surface of different metal oxides
by Mössbauer spectroscopy and XRD analysis. They reported that
the form and extent of dispersion of iron oxide on the surface of
the support depends on the number and availability of vacant sites
on the catalysts. They concluded that iron oxide forms crystalline
α-Fe2O3 on the surface of silica because
of the lack of vacant sites on the surface. This is in contrast to
other metal oxides studied, such as γ-alumina, ceria, titania,
and zirconia, which possess vacant surface sites, and where the Fe3+ first incorporates in these sites and only once these sites
are saturated with Fe3+ in its crystalline α-Fe2O3 form. In another studies, Popova et al.90 and Rangus et al.91 showed that the iron concentration in KIL-2 silica, prepared through
direct synthesis, influences the nature of metal species in the matrix.
They reported the presence of mostly isolated Fe3+ species
in samples with the low concentration of iron, Fe/Si ≤ 0.01,
while the formation of oligonuclear iron complex (FexOy) in samples with higher iron
content, F/Si > 0.01. In addition, Nechita et al.87 surmised the formation of different types of iron species
on an alumina surface compared to a silica surface.

Yuen et
al.,63 who investigated the
NO adsorption on silica-supported iron oxide, attributed the bands
at 1810 and 1750 cm–1 to the formation of dinitrosyl
and mononitrosyl species on low-coordination tetrahedral Fe2+/Fe(3–x)+ sites, respectively,
and the band at 1830 cm–1 to the formation of mononitrosyl
at high-coordination octahedral Fe2+/Fe(3–x)+ sites. They reported the low-coordination and
high-coordination Fe cations as strongly interacting with the support
and small particles of iron oxide on the surface, respectively. Mössbauer
spectroscopy disclosed the presence of both outer and inner doublets
in various catalysts with different proportions.89 The outer doublet is associated with the iron atoms on
the surface (high-coordination), while the inner doublet arises because
of iron atoms in the interior of crystallite (low-coordination). According
to Figure 7, the ratio
of iron as small particles of oxide on the surface to species, which
strongly interact with the support in the interior portion of the
catalyst, is greater for the silica-supported catalyst compared to
alumina. The absorption band at a wavenumber of 1841 cm–1 is assigned to NO adsorbed on isolated Fe2+ cations.33 No isolated Fe2+ was observed on
the surface of silica.

The overall intensity of the IR absorption
bands in the wavenumber
region of 1800–1860 cm–1 is higher for alumina-supported
iron oxide compared to silica-supported iron oxide. The reasons for
this could be either (i) stabilization of Fe2+ as FeAl2O4 during the formation of the catalyst in the
interaction of Fe2O3 with Al2O392 or (ii) improvement in the redox
property of Fe3+ due to a strong interaction between iron
oxide and alumina.93 The interaction inhibits
iron particle agglomeration, and as a result, the particle size distribution
is relatively narrow on the alumina support, but a significantly broader
particle size distribution is reported for iron nanoparticles on the
silica support. Moreover, the interaction of iron oxide with the silica
support is reported to be weaker than that observed with alumina as
a support.93,94

NO Adsorption on Oxidized
Alumina- and Silica-Supported Iron
Oxide Catalyst
Figure 9 illustrates the IR spectra of NO adsorption on the oxidized
alumina-supported iron oxide catalyst. Although the intensity of the
peak associated with NO adsorbed on Fe2+ decreases, it
highlights the presence of Fe2+ in the catalyst (oxygen-treated).
The remaining Fe2+ cations on the surface in the oxidized
state have been reported as stabilized compounds, such as FeAl2O4.92 The presence of
this structure has been confirmed by the H2-TPR experiment
in the alumina-supported iron oxide catalyst.

NO on the surface of oxygen-treated alumina-supported
iron oxide at 30 °C.

The presence of Fe2+ on the surface of the oxygen-treated
alumina-supported iron oxide catalyst was confirmed by studying the
adsorption of N2O on the catalyst surfaces. Grubert et
al.95 reported conversion of N2O to NO on the surface of Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-MCM-41-PS in which iron
cations are in their reduced form and iron is present exclusively
in the form of Fe2+ species. Figure 10 presents the IR spectra of the adsorbed
NO and N2O on Fe2+ cations on the surface of
oxygen-treated alumina-supported iron oxide. The peak at 2237 cm–1 is assigned to an N≡N stretching mode and
represents adsorbed N2O on the surface of alumina.

iron oxide/alumina after adsorbing (a) NO at 1 μbar pressure
and (b) N2O at 1 μbar pressure.

NO adsorption on the oxygen-treated silica-supported iron
oxide
is presented in Figure 11. The absence of a spectral feature in the region between
1750 and 1900 cm–1 indicates a lack of adsorption
of NO on the oxygen-treated silica-supported iron oxide, presumably
as a result of the oxidation of Fe2+ species to Fe3+.

silica-supported
iron oxide at 30 °C.

The differences between the iron oxide supported on alumina
and
silica for 2-CPh conversion and different VOCs and dioxin yields are
suggested to originate from different surface acidities as well as
the isolated cationic iron species observed on the alumina supported
catalyst. A lack of these species and lower acidity were observed
on the iron oxide supported on silica.

The pKa value of 2-CPh is 8.5; this
value includes solvent effects that are not considered in the adsorption
of basic molecules on the solid acids. Therefore, proton affinity
rather than the pKa value has been adopted
as an indicator of relative basicity.96 Proton affinity of 2-CPh and ammonia corresponds to 141097 and 857 kJ mol–1,98 respectively, at 25 °C. According to the
Brønsted–Lowry theory, a base is a proton acceptor, and
the higher the proton affinity, the stronger the base is. 2-CPh can
be considered as a base by comparing its proton affinity with that
of ammonia. Therefore, 2-CPh interacts with an acidic catalyst such
as alumina in our study more strongly than the silica catalyst which
possesses a less acidic characteristic compared to the alumina. In
addition, reducibility of transition metals plays a significant role
in the formation of dioxins from precursors.99 According to the TPR results, formation of FeAl2O4 species prevents the reduction of iron oxide on the alumina
support. It is also established that isolated iron cations, tetrahedrally
coordinated FeO4, exhibited higher catalytic activity compared
to iron oxide clusters and particles,100,101 and we propose
that the presence of isolated iron cations on the alumina support
could be responsible for significant decomposition of 2-CPh and accumulation
of a large quantity of carbon on the surface of the alumina-supported
iron oxide catalyst.

Conclusions
The type of supports
and catalysts’ preparation techniques
have a notable influence on the nature, acidity, dispersion, and reducibility
of the formed metal oxide species as well as on their catalytic activity.
Characterization and in situ FTIR analysis of catalysts confirms the
existence of significant differences between the two catalysts. Having
a larger pore diameter on the surface of silica enhanced agglomeration
of the iron oxide particle on that surface and the enhanced interaction
and vacant sites for iron on the δ-alumina results in formation
of isolated iron (Fe2+) species on this support. Moreover,
on the basis of the TPD analysis, the acidity of alumina-supported
iron oxide is significantly higher compared to that of the silica-supported
catalyst. Also, based on CO-chemisorption, the dispersion of iron
on the surface of alumina is greater than that determined for the
surface of silica. Finally, the reducibility of the two catalysts
of silica- and alumina-supported iron oxide is very different. The
former catalyst can reduce to Fe metal under reductant atmosphere;
however, the FeAl2O4 structure stabilized in
the latter catalyst and prevents further reduction of iron particles.
All these differentiation in chemistry between silica-supported and
alumina-supported iron oxide can explain the different observed behaviors
of 2-CPh conversion on the surface of these catalysts.

Methodology
Catalyst
Preparation
γ-Alumina-supported and
silica-supported iron oxide samples were prepared by adopting the
method of incipient wetness. A solution of iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate
(Chem-Supply) was mixed with alumina (Catal International Ltd) and,
in a separate preparation, the silica gel (Davisil grade 645) support,
in proportions designed to produce an approximately 3 wt % loading
of iron (with respect to the mass of the support) on the surface of
each of the supports. The solution was added to the supports drop-wise,
while mixing continuously until the mixture assumed paste-like consistency.
The sample was then dried at 110 °C and finally, calcined in
air at 450 °C for 5 h. The 3% loading of iron on the supports
is representative of the concentration of iron in most combustion
systems.102 In addition, we use this specific
iron concentration to compare our catalyst relative reactivities with
the same concentration of iron on the silica support studied by Nganai
et al.5

Catalyst Characterization
N2 Adsorption
The BET surface area (m2 g–1), average pore volume (cm3 g–1), and pore diameter (nm) of the samples were
determined by nitrogen adsorption at −196 °C using a Micromeritics
TriStar 3000 surface area analyser. Prior to any measurement, the
samples were degassed overnight at 150 °C using Micrometrics
VacPrep 061. The BET theory yielded the surface area of the samples,
and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method served to
estimate the pore-volume and pore-size distribution.

Acidic
Properties of the Catalysts
NH3-TPD
experiments were performed in a stainless steel apparatus, as described
previously.103 Desorption of gaseous species
during controlled heating of the sample was recorded by a Pfeiffer
Prisma quadrupole mass spectrometer, using the m/z signal at 16 for quantification of ammonia desorbing from
the catalyst during heating. In the TPD measurements, 0.1 g samples
were activated in situ, in the desorption tube at 450 °C for
half an hour. Following activation, ammonia gas adsorbed onto the
catalyst surface at 150 °C. Finally, the ammonia desorption experiments
proceeded with the sample being heated between 30 and 750 °C
at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1. Figure S1 represents the three primary m/z (17, 16 and 15) ions of ammonia desorbed
from the surface of alumina-supported iron oxide. As presented, the m/z = 17 ion current was affected by water
vapor at temperatures greater than 450 °C. Thus, the signal of m/z = 16 best reflects the desorption of
ammonia (NH2+), as this mass to charge ratio
is least contaminated with ions originating from water. For quantitative
analysis, ZSM-5 with Si/Al = 15 was used.

Inductively Coupled Plasma
Optical Emission Spectrometry
The elemental composition of
the catalysts was measured using ICP–OES
(Varian 715 ES spectrometer ICP–OES). Prior to analysis, samples
were dissolved in a solution containing 4.5 mL of HNO3 (65%),
4.5 mL of HCl (37%), and 3 mL of HBF4 (50%). Thulium (600
μL, 1000 ppmv) was added as an internal standard. To ensure
complete sample dissolution, the samples were digested in a Milestone
Start D microwave unit for a minimum of 2 h.

Temperature-Programmed
Reduction with Hydrogen
The
temperature-programmed reduction of the samples was performed using
10% H2 mixed with argon (Ar) with a flow rate of 32 cm3 min–1 as a reductant. A sample (600 mg)
was charged in a quartz tube, treated in a flow of Ar at 400 °C
for 1 h, and then cooled to room temperature. Finally, the sample
was heated to 800 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C min–1 under the reductant mixture. A thermal conductivity detector (Micromeritics
AutoChem II 2920) was used to measure the hydrogen consumption.

CO-Chemisorption
A static volumetric method allowed
measurement of the extent of metal dispersion and an estimation of
the active particle size of the metal on the surface of the support
using CO as the probe gas. Approximately 0.5 g of the sample was charged
into a sample holder placed in a temperature-controlled furnace. The
temperature of the sample was increased slowly to 450 °C under
a flow of He with a ramp rate of 5 °C min–1, the sample was then treated in the flow of H2 (50 mL
min–1) at 450 °C for 16 h, following purging
with He for 20 min. CO chemisorption was performed at 50 °C104 in the pressure range between 30 and 90 mbar.
Pfeiffer 362-TPG 261 Baratron and an acquisition program developed
in LabVIEW version 7.1.1 software were used. The program facilitated
vacuum measurements and data logging. Estimation of the dispersion
involved an assumption of one atom of CO molecule adsorbing onto two
iron surface atoms (Fes), thus the stoichiometric factor
used was CO/Fes–1 = 0.5.11,105−107 The Supporting Information presents the formula for estimating dispersion of the active particle
size (eq S1).

Scanning and Transmission
Electron Microscopy
Zeiss
SIGMA VP FESEM was used for the collection of SEM images of the catalysts
and supports. Images of the samples were taken by a secondary electron
and back-scattered electron detector at 15 kV. An EDX spectroscopy
detector enabled elemental analysis using Link Isis software.

A JEOL 2100 transmission electron microscope was used for TEM imaging
of supported catalysts. We measured the particle size by using Gatan
DigitalMicrograph software.

NO Adsorption Followed by in Situ FTIR Spectroscopy
All transmission spectra were recorded on a TENSOR 27 spectrometer
at a spectral resolution of 4 cm–1. The sample powders
were transformed into thin, self-supporting wafers, and transferred
into an in situ cell as described in a previous manuscript.108 Before the adsorption measurements at 30 °C,
samples were activated for 30 min at 450 °C under vacuum (vacuum-treated),
followed by 30 min in oxygen (oxygen-treated). Subsequent to these
treatment processes, NO absorption spectra were obtained over the
pressure range of 0.1 μbar to 10 mbar. Finally, difference spectra
are reported where the clean activated catalyst is subtracted from
the spectrum of the catalyst in contact with the probe molecule. All
spectra were recorded at the same temperature (30 °C).
