In
this work, pharmaceutically and biologically important compounds
containing imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine nuclei have been
synthesized via transannulation of N-heteroaryl aldehydes or ketones
with alkylamines using a graphene oxide-supported copper catalyst.
The nanocatalyst was fabricated by the covalent immobilization of
4-aminoantipyrine onto an amine-functionalized graphene oxide nanosupport
followed by its metallation with copper acetate. Structural analysis
by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction demonstrates
that the two-dimensional sheet-like structure of graphene oxide is
maintained even after the chemical modifications, whereas XPS revealed
crucial information related to elemental composition and surface electronic
states of the metal present in the catalyst. Apart from this, Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy helped in identifying the degree of
oxidation and the presence of oxygenated groups in graphene oxide
nanocomposites. As a heterogeneous catalyst, this graphene oxide-supported
copper complex showed moderate to good catalytic activity in the C(sp3)–H bond activation/amination of a variety of substrates.
This superior catalytic performance originated from the unique 2-dimensional
structure of graphene oxide-based material which provided space between
graphitic overlayers due to appropriate positioning of metal on their
basal planes, decreasing the diffusion resistances of reactant surfaces,
thus making it function as a nanoreactor. More importantly, this nanomaterial
could be recovered easily and reused repeatedly by simple washing
without chemical treatment with no appreciable loss in its catalytic
activity, showing good potential for increasing the overall turnover
number of this synthetically useful catalyst.

Introduction
Transition-metal-catalyzed
C–H amination represents an attractive
strategy for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds
as it provides undeniable benefits of high atom economy and reduced
waste generation, which cause such reactions to fall under the banner
of green chemistry.1−3 Although a noteworthy advancement in the C(sp2)–H bond activation strategy enabling C(sp2)–N bond formation has been witnessed in recent years,4−7 yet the catalytic functionalization of the relatively inert C(sp3)–H bonds which can provide a unique access to site-selective
C–N bonds remains a major challenge in synthetic organic chemistry.8−13 To accomplish C(sp3)–H bond activation, various
amine sources have been scrutinized which include arylamines and aliphatic
amines, amides, azides, haloamines, and so forth in the presence of
suitable transition-metal catalysts. Recently, N-heteroarenes have
proven their efficacy as an excellent amino source for the metal-catalyzed
C(sp3)–H amination.14−17

Imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine scaffolds are a class of
nitrogen-bridgehead-fused heterocycles, present in several pharmacologically
important molecules that unveil a broad spectrum of biological activities
such as antimicrobial, antineoplastic, antianxiety, anti-inflammatory,
and so forth.18−21 Apart from comprising intrinsic exceptional biological and pharmacological
properties, these compounds also serve as expedient predecessors for
a variety of functional group transformations. To date, a paucity
of approaches have been reported to construct imidazo[1,5-a]pyridines fundamentally relying on the Vilsmeier-type
protocol and Wallach imidazole synthesis.22−24 Nevertheless,
none of the methodologies enlisted in the literature are environmentally
benign because they inevitably involve the use of either excess amount
of additives, active starting materials, or multistep processes.25−30 Therefore, the development of new flexible, atom-economic, and proficient
protocols for these imidazo[1,5-a]pyridines is of
upsurge interest. In this direction, copper-catalyzed direct transannulation
of N-heteroaryl aldehydes or ketones with alkylamines that involves
a oxidative C(sp3)–H activation strategy has attracted
the synthetic pursuit of research studies as it represents one of
the most powerful gateways to obtain a diverse range of the substituted
imidazo[1,5-a]pyridines simply through one-pot condensation–amination–oxidative
dehydrogenation process.31−35 Though the homogeneous copper catalysts offer high conversion percentage,
selectivity, and yields under relatively mild operating conditions,
but their industrial applicability is hampered by the inherent problem
of catalyst separation from the reaction mixture and its recyclability.
Moreover, the presence of copper residues in the product stream renders
its commercial utility rather desolate in the pharmaceutical industries.
In view of these severe limitations, there is an urgent need to develop
novel retrievable catalytic systems that can surmount the challenges
of homogeneous catalysis and also preserve the best attributes of
both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for the generation of
a library of imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine nuclei.

The introduction of novel nanotechnologies has empowered the generation
of solid-supported heterogeneous nanoscale catalysts, which are effective
tools for controlling chemical reactivity as well as facile recovery.36−43 Amongst a multitude of solid nanostructures enlisted in the literature,
two-dimensional (2D) graphene oxide in particular offers excellent
prospects to provide a platform for such third-generation catalytic
systems owing to their exceptional structural properties such as nanometer
size, excellent chemical and thermal stability, good accessibility,
porosity, and large surface area-to-volume ratio. In addition, these
nanosheets provide the opportunity to tune the structure of the catalyst
via chemical modifications because of the presence of numerous hydroxyl,
epoxy, carboxyl, and carbonyl groups on its surface which allow the
immobilization of a diverse array of reagents and also intensify their
use in different chemical transformations.44−48

Our recent fast-growing research focused on
the development of
sustainable organic–inorganic hybrid nanomaterials motivated
us to come up with new graphene oxide-based retrievable 2D nanocatalytic
system that substantiated their efficiency in C(sp3)–H
activation for direct transannulation of N-heteroaryl aldehydes or
ketones with alkylamines using molecular oxygen as an oxidant.49−54 This novel nanostructured catalyst not only demonstrates benefits
such as the ease of product separation but can also be used for multiple
runs without any appreciable loss in its catalytic activity. The reason
behind the good catalytic efficacy can be attributed to chemically
modified graphene oxide that forms crumpled nanosheets/nanostacks
which provide engineered internal cavities creating unique incarcerate
nanoscale environments for chemical reactions. Moreover, utilization
of molecular oxygen as an environmentally benign oxidant to achieve
this oxidative transformation functions as a prevailing tool to enhance
the sustainability of chemical process as there is no formation of
side product. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first
example of atom economical and environmentally benign C–H amination
wherein a graphene oxide-based copper catalyst has been effectively
exploited for the synthesis of pharmaceutically and biologically significant
compounds.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
Graphite
flakes (Sigma-Aldrich),
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES, Alfa Aesar), and 4-aminoantipyrine
(AA) (Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd, India) were commercially procured. All
other reagents and solvents employed for the synthesis were of analytical
grade and used as received.

Characterization Techniques
Transmission
electron microscopy
(TEM) analysis was carried using a Tecnai G2 T30 microscope in order
to determine the morphology of nanosheets. Field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) images were obtained in order to derive
information about the morphological characteristics of nanosheets
using a Tescan Mira 3 FESEM instrument. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic
(EDS) analysis equipped with the FESEM (Zeiss FESEM) was achieved
for the elemental mapping of the nanocomposites. Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra were acquired through a PerkinElmer Spectrum
2000 using the KBr pellet method that was operative in the range of
4000–500 cm–1 under atmospheric conditions
with a resolution of 1 cm–1. Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) was carried out using a Rigaku Ultima (IV) diffractometer with
Cu Kα radiation at a scanning rate of 2° min–1 in the 2θ range of 8–80° (40 kV, 40 mA). Energy-dispersive
X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectroscopy was performed using a Fischerscope
X-ray XAN-FAD BC. The copper content in the nanocatalyst was estimated
by using a flame atomic absorption spectrometer (model no. N3180021
PinAAcle 500) using an acetylene flame. All of the derived products
were examined through the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) hyphenated technique that was conducted utilizing the
Agilent gas chromatograph (6850 GC) with a HP-5MS 5% phenyl methyl
siloxane capillary column (30.0 m × 250 μm × 0.25
μm) and a quadrupole mass filter equipped 5975 mass selective
detector using helium as the carrier gas.

Preparation of Organoamine-Functionalized
Graphene Oxide Nanocomposites
(APTES@GO)
GO was prepared by the oxidation of graphite powder
via the modified Hummers’ method.55 For obtaining amine-functionalized graphene oxide (APTES@GO) nanocomposites,
APTES (2 mmol) was added dropwise to a well-dispersed solution of
GO (1.0 g) in ethanol (200 mL) and stirred under reflux conditions
for 5 h.56 The resulting mixture was separated
via centrifugation, washed several times with ethanol to remove residual
APTES, and dried under vacuum overnight.

Synthesis of Graphene Oxide
Nanosheet-Based Copper Catalyst
(Cu@AA@APTES@GO)
The final synthesis of the Cu@AA@APTES@GO
nanocatalyst was carried out using a two-step procedure. First, organoamine-functionalized
graphene oxide (0.5 g) was dispersed in ethanol (30 mL) using an ultrasonic
bath. Thereafter, AA was added to suspension and stirred under reflux
conditions for 6 h in order to obtain AA@APTES@GO.57 In the next step, AA@APTES@GO was added to a solution containing
copper acetate (1.5 mmol) in acetone (100 mL) and stirred at room
temperature for 24 h. The resulting nanocomposites were removed through
centrifugation, washed thoroughly with ethanol, and dried under vacuum
to obtain the Cu@AA@APTES@GO nanocatalyst (Scheme 1).58,59

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration
for the Synthesis of Cu@AA@APTES@GO Nanocatalyst
General Procedure for the Reaction
A mixture of 2-acetylpyridine
(0.10 mmol) and benzyl amine (0.10 mmol) was refluxed at 80 °C
in the presence of the Cu@AA@APTES@GO nanocatalyst (15 mg) using acetonitrile
(2 mL) as a solvent and then stirred for the desired reaction time.
The progress of the reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(ethyl acetate–hexane). After completion of reaction, the mixture
was allowed to cool to room temperature and the nanocatalyst was recovered
via centrifugation. Then, the reaction mixture was quenched with water
and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were
separated and dried over Na2SO4, and the solvent
was removed under vacuum. The products obtained were thereafter analyzed
and confirmed by GC–MS.

Results and Discussion
Motivation
and Strategy
Considering the scarcity of
sustainable methods integrating efficiency, selectivity, and reusability
in a single platform, through the present work, we report graphene
oxide-supported copper catalyst for the synthesis of imidazo[1,5-a]pyridines. The utilization of the 2D heterostructure of
the catalytic material that provides intriguing confined space between
graphitic overlayers and metal surfaces enables it to function as
a nanoreactor, thereby playing an indispensable role in expediting
this reaction and affording the target products with good to excellent
yield. Also, the extremely high thermal conductivity of graphene oxide
allows conduction and diffusion of the heat produced during catalytic
reactions that makes it a good candidate for the support matrix.

FT-IR Spectroscopy
The FT-IR spectra of GO, APTES@GO,
AA@APTES@GO, and Cu@AA@APTES@GO are demonstrated in Figure 1. FT-IR spectroscopy identifies
the degree of oxidation and presence of the oxygenated species in
GO. In the spectrum of GO, the characteristic peaks at 3410, 1730,
1624, 1402, and 1062 cm–1 are due to the OH, C=O
in −COOH, aromatic C=C, carboxy C–O, and epoxy
C–O stretches, respectively, situated at the edges of GO nanosheets.60 Thereafter, the covalent functionalization of
the nanosupport with APTES is confirmed through the presence of additional
absorption band at 2930 cm–1 which is assigned to
stretching vibrations of C–H bonds, whereas the bands at 1622
and 3434 cm–1 that can be attributed to N–H
stretching and bending vibrations. The sequential introduction of
ligand (AA) to the silane terminal by condensation with apical amine
groups is verified by the appearance of a strong band at 1630 cm–1 which is associated with the stretching vibrations
of C=N. Consistent with this interpretation, a noticeable shift
(1626 cm–1) in the imine vibrations of the Schiff
base which can be accredited to electron delocalization of C=N
and coordination interaction with the copper metal.61 These results confirm the successful anchoring of copper
complex onto the GO surface as Cu@AA@APTES@GO.

GO, (b) APTES@GO, (c) AA@APTES@GO, and (d)

XRD Analysis
XRD
analysis was done in order to investigate
the phase structure and crystallinity of the nanocomposites. Figure 2 depicts that graphite
powder exhibits a high degree of crystallinity with an intense and
sharp diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.8° which corresponds
to the crystal plane (002) with an interplanar distance of 0.33 nm.62 In contrast, unmodified GO shows a lower degree
of crystallinity with a small broad diffraction peak at 2θ =
10.7° having d-spacing 0.825 nm corresponding
to the (001) crystal plane.63 Clearly,
the increase in the interlayer distance of graphene oxide indicates
the hydration and exfoliation of GO in an aqueous medium which revealed
the formation of various oxygen containing functionalities such as
hydroxyl, epoxy, carbonyl, carboxyl groups, and so forth. After the
immobilization of aminopropyl moiety on GO nanosheets, the diffraction
peak at around 10.7° does not disappear, suggesting that the
structure of GO is not destroyed; however, a decrease in the intensity
of this peak can be observed along with the appearance of a new peak
around 22°.64 Moreover, ligand-grafted
amine-functionalized graphene oxide and final nanocatalyst showed
further decrease in the intensity of both of these diffraction peaks.
The decrease in the intensity of the diffraction peak of GO with successive
surface modifications could be attributed to the intercalation of
functional groups, suggesting the decrease in ordered arrangement
of GO nanosheets.65−67

Morphology Analysis
FESEM and TEM are powerful magnification
tools which provide detailed information about the evolution of morphology,
composition, and texture of nanocomposites. The nanomaterials, both
before and after grafting, were also characterized by FESEM and TEM.
As displayed in Figure 3, it can be visualized that GO inherits twisted 2D planar morphology.
Further, as we move from GO to APTES@GO to Cu@AA@APTES@GO, the extent
of crumpling and protrusions increases which provide evidences for
enormous surface area of nanomaterials. Therefore, these lamellar
folded flakes (well-stacked layered structure) with wrinkles induce
not only high degree of active catalytic sites but also serve as a
versatile platform for efficient chemical transformations. Besides,
a thorough analysis of TEM micrograph of GO confirms the corrugated
sheet-like nature of material with a lateral dimension up to several
micrometers. Further, it is observed that even after the surface modification
with organic functionalization moieties, the corrugated sheet-like
structure of GO nanocomposites is maintained. Apart from this, the
selected-area electron diffraction pattern of GO shown in the inset
of Figure 3f shows
sharp diffraction spots indicating amorphous nature of GO flakes.68−70 Additionally, SEM and TEM images of the recovered nanocatalyst do
not show any change in their crumpled morphology, suggesting that
the catalyst is robust enough to withstand the applied reaction conditions
(Figures S1 and S2).

(a) GO, (b) APTES@GO, and (c) Cu@AA@APTES@GO

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron
spectra of Cu@AA@APTES@GO are presented in Figure 4. The surface electronic states and the interactions
of chemically modified GO were assessed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). The appearance of a band around 286.2 eV designates C–O–C
and C–OH bonds which indicate a considerable degree of oxidation
and the presence of different oxygen-containing groups. In addition,
the C 1s spectrum of the catalyst reveals two more bands at 284.7
that correspond to C–H and C–C bonds and 288.4 eV which
arises from O–C=O bonds. Besides, new bands at 399.4,
400.8, and 401.33 emerging in the N 1s spectrum are attributed to
C–N=C, C–N–H, and =N–, respectively
(Figure S3). Moreover, the presence of
a band at 102.1 eV accredited to Si–O arises in the Si 2p spectrum.
This designates the silylation reaction between silanol group of APTES
and GO surface hydroxyl groups. Further, the Cu 2p XPS spectrum of
the nanocatalyst shows two typical bands at 934.6 and 954.5 eV, which
correspond to the binding energies of copper(II). In addition, a Cu
2p3/2 satellite peak appearing at 943.5 eV explained the
coordination interaction between the ligand and the copper center.71,72

of the nanocatalyst.

Elemental and Compositional Analysis
The composition
of nanostructured GO-supported catalyst was also confirmed by EDS
(Figures 5, 6, and S4) and ED-XRF
spectroscopy (Figure S5). EDS elemental
mapping images of the graphene oxide-supported copper catalyst clearly
show the presence of all of the elements, that is, Cu, C, N, Si, and
O on the surface of the GO nanosheets which provides the evidence
for the successful organoamine functionalization, ligand grafting,
and metallation. Further, a well-resolved peak of copper in the ED-XRF
spectrum of Cu@AA@APTES@GO also confirms the successful metallation
of AA@APTES@GO.73 Subsequently, the quantitative
estimation of the copper content in the synthesized nanocatalyst was
done after digestion using atomic absorption spectroscopy, and the
corresponding copper loading was estimated to be 0.126 mmol g–1.

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy is a powerful
technique to study the structural and chemical changes in the obtained
nanomaterials. The Raman spectra of GO, APTES@GO, AA@APTES@GO, and
Cu@AA@APTES@GO are shown in Figure 7. The presence of two characteristic peaks centered
at 1597 and 1347 cm–1 is attributed to G and D bands
of GO which are associated with the vibrations of sp2 bonded
carbon networks.74,75 Further, chemical modifications
of GO are confirmed by comparing the intensity ratio of D and G bands
(ID/IG). The
increase in the ID/IG ratio from 0.98 to 1.01, 1.04, and 1.05 confirms the stepwise
covalent anchoring of aminosilane chain, ligand grafting, and metallation
onto the surface of GO.76

Optimizations
Initial optimization studies for transannulation
of N-heteroaryl aldehydes or ketones were carried out using 2-acetylpyridine
and benzyl amine as standard substrates. The presence of the catalyst
was found to be necessary because no appreciable amount of the product
was detected in its absence. Thereafter, we employed different catalysts
for affording the desired product (Table S1). The highest conversion percentage was obtained in the case of
the Cu@AA@APTES@GO nanocatalyst, suggesting the efficiency of the
graphene oxide-based copper nanocomposites for C(sp3)–H
amination (Figure S8).

Amount of the
Catalyst
The key parameter to evaluate
the catalytic performance is the effect of the amount of the catalyst.
In order to evaluate its effect on model reaction, we carried out
six experiments in which we simply increased the amount of the catalyst
from 5 to 30 mg. It was observed that the 100% conversion was obtained
when the amount of the Cu@AA@APTES@GO nanocatalyst was increased from
5 to 15 mg (Figure 8). Further, it was observed that the conversion percentage remained
same on increasing the amount of the catalyst up to 25 mg. However,
on increasing the amount of the catalyst to 30 mg, conversion percentage
decreased because of the low dispersity of the excess catalyst in
the reaction media which is caused due to steric hindrance of the
mass transfer between the active site and reagent. Therefore, the
best result was obtained when the reaction was performed using 15
mg of the nanocatalyst.

Figure 8 Effect of amount of the catalyst on the transannulation
of N-heteroaryl
aldehydes or ketones [reaction conditions: 2-acetylpyridine (0.10
mmol), benzyl amine (0.10 mmol), acetonitrile (2 mL), catalyst (x mg), 10 h, 80 °C].

Effect of Time
The catalytic efficacy of Cu@AA@APTES@GO
in the transannulation of N-heterocyclic aldehydes was studied at
different time intervals. The conversion percentage has been represented
as a function of time in Figure 9. A close comparison of results revealed that the conversion
percentage increased from 25 to 100% as time was increased from 2
to 10 h. Further, when the reaction was continued for 12 h, no significant
change was observed. Therefore, the reaction time for transannulation
of N-heteroaryl aldehydes or ketones was optimized as 10 h.

Figure 9 Effect of time
on the transannulation of N-heteroaryl aldehydes
or ketones [reaction conditions: 2-acetylpyridine (0.10 mmol), benzyl
amine (0.10 mmol), acetonitrile (2 mL), catalyst (15 mg), 80 °C].

Effect of Temperature
Temperature is one of the significant
parameters which play a vital role in influencing the thermodynamic
activities of the reaction. In order to determine the most favorable
reaction conditions using Cu@AA@APTES@GO as a catalyst, the test reaction
was carried out at diverse range of temperatures (40–80 °C).
The conversion percentage has been represented as a function of temperature
(Supporting Information Figure S6). Compared
with the results obtained at 80 °C, a lower conversion of 35%
to the desired product was obtained at 60 °C, suggesting that
the catalytic activity of the graphene oxide-based copper nanocatalyst
decreased by decreasing the reaction temperature. As expected, no
desired product was formed at room temperature. Notably, the optimized
temperature for the synthesis of imidazo[1,5-a]pyridines
was 80 °C.

Effect of Solvents
Nature of solvents
has a remarkable
impact on conversion percentage of the desired products. Therefore,
in order to study their effect on the concerned reaction, test substrates
were subjected to different polar and nonpolar solvents. First, the
test reaction was carried out in polar solvents (ethanol and acetonitrile)
which resulted in 73 and 100% of desired product, whereas in the presence
of nonpolar solvents (hexane and toluene), only 57 and 63% of conversion
percentage were obtained (Figure 10). In fact, lowest conversion percentage was observed
when the experiment was run in solvent-free conditions, even if the
reaction was carried out for a prolonged period of time. Therefore,
the order of reactivity in different solvents was found to be acetonitrile
> ethanol > toluene > hexane > solvent-free.

Figure 10 Effect of
solvents on the transannulation of N-heteroaryl aldehydes
or ketones [reaction conditions: 2-acetylpyridine (0.10 mmol), benzyl
amine (0.10 mmol), solvent (2 mL), catalyst (15 mg), 10 h, 80 °C].

Scope of Substrates
On the basis of these promising
screening results, we next scrutinized the scope of the current procedure
by testing several pyridine aldehyde or ketone derivatives and amines
using the graphene oxide-supported copper catalyst. First, we evaluated
the scope of amine derivatives bearing either electron-donating or
electron-withdrawing groups under the optimized reaction conditions,
and the results are demonstrated in Table 1. It was found that amines containing electron-withdrawing
or electron-donating groups gave moderate to good conversion percentages
of the desired products. Subsequently, a series of N-heterocyclic
aldehydes or ketones were examined as reaction partners. The results
indicated that a diverse range of N-heterocyclic aldehydes or ketones
were all compatible with this transformation showing moderate to good
conversion percentages. The most important feature of the present
approach is that this tandem reaction is devoid of unwanted side products.

Mechanism
A plausible catalytic cycle on the basis
of previous literature reports has been proposed and is shown in Scheme 2. First, the condensation
reaction between N-heteroarene aldehyde or ketone and alkylamine generates
complex A.32 In the next step, complex
B is formed via the coordinative interaction of copper(II) with the
pyridyl N-atom of complex A. Thereafter, oxidative dehydrogenation
of complex B in the presence of copper(II) generates complex C which
undergoes isomerization to give complex D that eventually eliminates
the imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine product by giving Cu species.
Finally, the catalyst is regenerated back via the removal of water.77

of N-Heterocyclic Aldehydes
and Alkylamines Using Cu@AA@APTES@GO as a Catalyst
Catalytic Activity Tests
Reusability
of a catalyst
is an important aspect from the commercial point of view as it increases
the potentiality of the catalyst. In order to take advantage of the
heterogeneous nature, the recyclability of the Cu@AA@APTES@GO nanocatalyst
was investigated for the test reaction. In order to do so, after completion
of the reaction, the catalyst was easily recovered from the reaction
media by means of centrifugation and used for the next catalytic cycles
without any additional treatment. Thanks to the high stability of
the graphene oxide-supported copper nanocatalyst that could catalyze
the full conversion of test substrates during all repeated cycles
without any significant loss in catalytic activity (Figure 11). This observation was further
supported by SEM, TEM, and FT-IR analysis of the recovered catalyst
(Figures S1, S2, and S7) which showed that
the structure of recovered catalyst remained unchanged in comparison
to fresh catalyst that provided a concrete proof of the excellent
stability of the catalyst.

of N-heterocyclic
aldehydes and alkylamines [reaction conditions: 2-acetylpyridine (0.10
mmol), benzyl amine (0.10 mmol), acetonitrile (2 mL), catalyst (15
mg), 10 h, 80 °C].

In order to verify that the observed catalysis was due to
the graphene
oxide-supported copper nanocatalyst rather than leached copper species
in solution, a hot filtration experiment of test reaction was carried
out. The solid catalyst was removed from the reaction mixture with
the assistance of centrifugation after 5 h (half the reaction time),
and the reaction was continued with the solid-free filtrate for an
additional 5 h. Subsequently, the supernatant was analyzed by GC–MS
in order to find out the conversion percentage, and it was observed
that the reaction had reached 62% completion at the end of 5 h. There
was no appreciable change in the conversion percentage of the desired
product when the supernatant was subjected to further stirring after
removing the solid catalyst from it. The GC–MS results showed
that the reaction was hard to occur even after prolonged time as the
removal of catalyst had stopped the reactivity. Thus, these results
demonstrated that there was no loss of catalytic components during
the course of reaction.

Comparison of the Catalytic Activity of Cu@AA@APTES@GO
with
the Previously Reported Catalytic Systems
In order to compare
the advantages of the present approach, an extensive study of previous
literature precedents was carried out for the transannulation of N-heteroaryl
aldehydes or ketones with alkylamines. It is important to note that
all of the earlier catalysts employed for the concerned reaction were
homogeneous and had serious limitations. A homogeneous catalyzed reaction
mixture could lead to the formation of inactive dimers or aggregates
which obstructed the catalytic active sites, thereby hampering its
activity. Besides, it is clearly evident from Table 2 that graphene oxide-based copper catalyst
revealed good catalytic results in comparison to other catalysts employed
till date. Moreover, homogeneous catalysts could not be recovered
as they undergo decomposition immediately after the completion of
the reaction and could not be reused for further cycles. On the contrary,
the graphene oxide-based copper nanocatalysts could be recovered easily
via centrifugation and recycled for six consecutive cycles without
any significant loss in its catalytic activity.

Cu@AA@APTES@GO with Other Catalyst Reported in the Literature for
Transannulation of N-Heteroaryl Aldehydes or Ketones with Alkylamines
Conclusions
In
summary, we have successfully developed a new heterogeneous
catalyst that is composed of exfoliated 2D graphene oxide-based nanomaterial
for transannulation of N-heteroaryl aldehydes or ketones with alkylamines.
We employed a simple and general route for the immobilization of copper
complex onto amine-functionalized graphene oxide nanosheets for the
synthesis of the Cu@AA@APTES@GO nanocatalyst. The presence of abundant
oxygenated hydroxyl functional groups on basal planes of exfoliated
2D graphene oxide nanocomposites provides very effective and powerful
sites for the loading of Schiff base metal complex. It exhibits significantly
improved catalytic efficiencies which could be accredited to the presence
of nanometer size of support material and 2D confinement that provides
a large number of catalytically active sites. Further, the efficacy
of the synthesized Cu@AA@APTES@GO catalyst can also be realized by
focusing on the results of various catalytic activity tests conducted
which include simple work up procedure, substrate scope, hot filtration,
and recyclability experiments. Consequently, this methodology offers
a new approach for the transannulation of N-heteroaryl aldehydes or
ketones with alkylamines using graphene oxide-supported copper catalyst
under mild reaction conditions.
