Dynamic viscosity
has been used to describe molecular resistance to flow under an applied
force. This study introduces the theory of biophysical viscosity,
the resistance of a region to molecular flow under environmental force
to define the rates of per capita anthropogenic chemical efflux into
the environment. Biophysical viscosity is an important intermediate
quantity, in that it can be used to calculate the chemical potentials
of single molecules for individuals in a population. Nonhypothetical
emission data was combined with chemical potentials of anthropogenic
tracers, to demonstrate that thermodynamic quantities can be used
as parameters to directly compare energies associated with individual
chemical emissions across geographic regions. These results indicate
that population density is not the only factor in the determination
of population-level chemical efflux and that biophysical viscosity
is a useful tool in determining the per capita chemical potentials
of anthropogenic chemicals for environmental risk assessment.

==== Body
Introduction
More than half of all accessible surface
freshwater on Earth is
allocated for human use.1 With unprecedented
release of anthropogenic micropollutants and their subsequent transformation
products (TPs) into depleting freshwater supplies, accurate monitoring
of the remaining water resources is necessary to ensure future environmental
and human health.2,3 The quantity and diversity of
organic chemicals consumed on a global scale has resulted in complex
TPs that conventional Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs) may
not be designed to eliminate.4 Biologically
active TPs may present toxicities greater than or equal to those of
their precursors yet go undetected by traditional analytical approaches.5 As the physicochemical treatment of compounds
in WRRFs is dependent on plant design, the removal efficiency of complex
TPs from potable water sources will vary between sites.6,7 As increasingly complex TPs present a challenge to future WRRF designs,
it is vital that analytical methodology be evolved to rapidly identify
potential contamination with chemical lifecycle models.

Caffeine
has been used as an anthropogenic marker for wastewater
contamination and has also been used in ambient water quality monitoring
as it frequently co-occurs with coliforms in contaminated surface
waters.8,9 The concentrations of caffeine found in
aqueous environments have been positively correlated with emerging
contaminants that affect important hormonal physiological processes.10,11 Molecular modeling studies have confirmed the stability of caffeine
complexes in aqueous solutions through purine stacking.12 Caffeine has been shown to influence the solubility
of other aromatic contaminants through intermolecular π-stacking,
which may influence the persistence of the TPs during WRRF processes
and subsequent biological uptake from WRRF effluents in urban environments.13,14 Application of environmental risk
assessment models that use aqueous caffeine concentrations can be
used as a method to prioritize samples for biological assay.15

Pharmaceuticals, including caffeine, have
been tracked through
wastewater treatment processes with gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS), and their potential molecular fates have
been reviewed.16,17 GC–MS is limited in its
capability to measure analytes that are heat-labile or distinguish
between enantiomers that possess different biological half-lives.
Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) has
been used extensively to identify emerging anthropogenic contaminants
of concern in sewage treatment plant effluents, surface water, and
sea water.18 Environmental persistence
of synthetic chemicals includes usage, disposal, and re-entry into
nutrient cycles in the biosphere. A conceptual basis to assess individual
molecular emissions by populations to the aquatic environment is needed
to actively monitor environmental and human health.

As a predictive
tool in the environmental fate of chemical species,
fugacity defines chemical potentials associated with the environmental
partitioning of compounds with similar functionalities.19 Although fugacity is sufficient for predicting
phase preferences of single molecules within an order of magnitude,
it is limited by the uncertainty in the emission rates of the parent
compounds in dynamic equilibrium with potentially more toxic TPs.20 Application of fugacity and thermodynamic activity
models requires that a compound’s fugacity capacity and solubility
be known.21 Fugacity ratios (a chemical’s
fugacity in an organism relative to that in its environment) have
been used in environmental risk assessment for commercial synthetic
molecules, but no approach has utilized units of energy to model point-source
chemical emissions of individuals that comprise a geographic area
adjacent to water bodies.21

Fugacity
is based on chemical potential (μ), which is defined
as the tendency of chemicals to react, transform, and migrate.22 Chemical potential can describe equilibria in
which two driving forces compensate for one other.22 An intrinsic dynamic equilibrium exists between human populations
that synthesize or concentrate chemicals and the greater environment
in which they are transformed or diluted (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Per capita μ depicting the dynamic equilibrium
of molecules
that are continuously anthropogenically concentrated and environmentally
diluted.

Chemical potentials are temperature-dependent
energies that can
offer insight into conditions that affect emerging contaminant behavior
in the face of climate change.23 The purpose
of this article is to provide a conceptual basis for monitoring the
changes in contaminants over time at the population level by coupling
thermodynamic principles with nonhypothetical anthropogenic chemical
concentrations in aquatic systems.

Theory/Calculation
Viscosity is a bulk property commonly used to describe a substance’s
resistance to flow, with dimensions of mass, distance, and time.26 Internal molecular forces, temperature, pressure,
and gravity are conditions that influence viscosity.26 The concept of viscosity is less applied to the diffusion
of individual molecules through the biophysical environment, from
a point source to an area of potential contamination.

Biophysical
viscosity of a point source can be viewed as a measure
of internal friction or resistance of molecular flow under environmental
force that is determined by physicochemical properties, the degree
of (a)biotic transformation, biological sequestration, and sorption
processes. A low biophysical viscosity would indicate that a point
source is able to disperse contaminants more readily than an area
with a higher biophysical viscosity. An analogy of biophysical viscosity
related to equilibrium systems is found in Gibb’s work, wherein
“anything that restricts the free movement of a component substance
is found to diminish the number of conditions necessary for equilibrium”.27

Independent of environmental molecular
path, the measured concentration
of anthropogenic tracers can be used to compare the rates at which
a given population deposits a molecular footprint on the surrounding
environment.

A conceptual schematic is shown in Figure 2, wherein the population density
of a geographic
region (A) is viewed as the average concentration of a molecule that
an individual is capable of releasing per unit area (B). (C) shows
the biophysical viscosity of
the molecule as it is transported from a given area of defined density
to the aquatic environment. Biophysical viscosity, η, can be
used as a metric to quantitatively compare the effect of population
density on contaminant flow over time and is defined in eq 1 1  where c is the average measured
analyte concentration (kg/m3), ρ is the population
density of the associated geographic area (persons/m2),
and Δt is the time (s) period over which the
measured concentration of a chemical is averaged. Equation 2 gives SI units for biophysical
viscosity in (kg/person m s). 2  There are many mechanistic
variables associated
with molecular transport in the chemical lifecycle; however, biophysical
viscosity can be used to derive chemical potentials associated with
equilibria between human populations and the environment. Anthropogenic
conditions placed on the environment have resulted in masses and concentrations
of chemicals that are entirely different in composition from those
of chemicals that have existed before. Calculating chemical potentials,
or the tendency of a system to yield particles, can provide a conceptual
framework to monitor the concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants
in equilibrium with the environment by calculating the per capita
energies associated with emission.

Figure 2 Concept of biophysical viscosity.

As there is a characteristic flow
rate and resistance to flow for
each molecule through the environment, flow rate Q (eq 3) and biophysical
viscosity η, can be used to derive the per capita chemical potential,
μ, in eq 4. The
SI unit for per capita chemical potential is shown in eq 5 in J/person 3   4   5  The per capita
chemical potential can be viewed
as the change in energy when one person is added/removed from a population
or the energy associated with per capita usage/disposal of a substance.
Quantitation of the energy associated with molecular movement from
a higher chemical potential in anthropogenic sources to a lower chemical
potential in the environment is a useful point of reference to simplify
contaminant flow modeling to energy units per person. This can also
be useful to objectively compare the chemical footprints of geographic
regions for individual molecules of concern in environmental risk
assessment.

Results and Discussion
Caffeine concentrations in the
San Marcos River (San Marcos, TX)
and rivers in Sao Paolo State, Brazil, were confirmed with LC–MS/MS.
GC–MS/MS data was used to determine Lubbock caffeine concentrations
at a water reclamation plant influent in a West Texas community, which
was used as a pilot facility for the fate of pharmaceuticals and personal
care products. The measured caffeine concentrations were initially
in μg/L and converted to kg/m3. The confidence limits
of caffeine measurements over a 6 month period are reported in Table 1, except for the site
at Campinas, BR (B), where caffeine was only detected once (n = 1) over the time course.

Population densities were used in conjunction with
mean contaminant
concentrations measured over a 6 month period, to evaluate per capita
human contributions of chemical efflux to local aquatic systems. Caffeine
was used here as a model compound to determine the viability of using
biophysical viscosity as a factor for comparing molecular footprints
of geographic regions of interest. Using eq 1, the biophysical viscosity was calculated
for seven cities in Brazil and Texas. Locations, sampling times, mean
caffeine concentrations, calculated biophysical viscosities, and associated
rankings are summarized in Table 1.

This model found that Rio Preto had the lowest
biophysical viscosity
per capita, indicating that it has a relatively low resistance to
biophysical flow of caffeine into the Rio Preto River. Campinas is
a city geographically connected with two main aquatic sources, the
Atibaia and Capiveri Rivers. In cases in which a single location is
treated as a point source of chemical emission with effluent streams
to various water bodies, biophysical viscosity varies depending on
the contaminant concentration within the water body.

Per capita
biophysical viscosity focuses on the transport of molecules
through the environment once it is emitted from a point source, it
does not address the chemical potential or fundamental energy associated
with the emission itself. Chemical potential is used here to define
the emission energy for an individual molecule from a single person
as an objective metric for comparing contaminants efflux across geographic
regions.

Chemical potential is derived from per capita biophysical
viscosity
and the flow rate of an individual molecule through an environmental
system (eq 5). Flow rates
of the rivers associated with cities in Table 1 were used to calculate the per capita chemical
potentials of caffeine (eq 5) and are summarized in Table 2.28

Calculations of the per capita chemical potentials
for caffeine
show large differences between San Marcos, TX, and cities that comprise
Sao Paulo State, Brazil. San Marcos, TX, was found to have a per capita
chemical potential value that is 2 orders of magnitude higher than
that of Baruieri, BR, even though Barueri has a population density
40 times greater than that of San Marcos. A higher chemical potential
would indicate that residents in San Marcos have a higher per capita
usage and disposal of caffeine. It is a common conception that increased
population density necessitates an increase in molecular consumption
and subsequent emission. These results indicate that population density
is not the only factor in the determination of population-level chemical
efflux and that biophysical viscosity is a useful tool in determining
the per capita emissions of anthropogenic chemicals.

Conclusions
It is known that there are many factors that influence molecular
flow through the environment. However, a first approximation biophysical
viscosity model calculates energies associated with individual contaminant
emissions in populations over time on the basis of simple expressions
and is non-data-intensive. These calculations demonstrate that biophysical
viscosity and chemical potential can be used as parameters to directly
compare energies associated with individual chemical emissions across
geographic regions. This model can accommodate for changes in population,
chemical concentration, speciation of metabolites, and environmental
flow rates over time. It is also useful for city planning, in that
there is a critical level of contaminant turnover that must be reached
to determine appropriate WRRF designs for water resource management
and reclamation. These thermodynamic parameters can be readily integrated
with chemical lifecycle models to provide real-time epidemiologic
data for application in environmental risk assessment.

Materials and
Methods
Details of all geographic locations, analytical standards,
reagents,
sample collection methods, sampling sites, and instrumental analyses
included in this study are discussed elsewhere.11,24,25 As a part of the São Paulo Researchers
in International Collaboration, anthropogenic tracers were measured
in both Texas and Brazil for evaluation of the criteria to prioritize
sampling in international water quality programs. Caffeine was chosen
as a representative anthropogenic tracer in all locations, as it has
been shown to be a useful indicator in assessing estrogenic activity
in both source and drinking water.13 LC–MS
measurement of caffeine is used here as a proof of concept for other
anthropogenic small molecules that may be used as biomarkers for modeling
potential disease states in populations.
