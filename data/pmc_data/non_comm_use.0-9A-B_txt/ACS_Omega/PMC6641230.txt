Little is known about
the detailed structural information at the
interface of Ptn cluster and γ-Al2O3(001) surface, which plays an important role
in the dehydrogenation and cracking of hydrocarbons. Here, the nucleation
and growth of Ptn (n =
1–8, 13) clusters on a γ-Al2O3(001)
surface have been examined using density functional theory. For the
most stable configuration Ptn/γ-Al2O3(001) (n = 1–8, 13),
Ptn clusters bond to the γ-Al2O3(001) surface through Pt–O and Pt–Al
bonds at the expense of electron density of the Ptn cluster. With the increase in the Ptn cluster size, both the metal–support interaction and
the nucleation energies exhibit an odd–even oscillation pattern,
which are lower for an even Ptn cluster
size than those for its adjacent odd ones. Both the metal–surface
and metal–metal interactions are competitive, which control
the nanoparticle morphology transition from two-dimension (2D) to
three-dimension (3D). On the γ-Al2O3(001)
surface, when the metal–support interaction governs, smaller
clusters such as Pt1, Pt2, Pt3, and
Pt4 prefer a planar 2D nature. Alternatively, when the
metal–metal interaction dominates, larger clusters such as
Pt5, Pt6, Pt7, Pt8, and
Pt13 exhibit a two-layer structure with one or more Pt
atoms on the top layer not interacting directly with the support.
Herein, the Pt4 cluster is the most stable 2D structure;
Pt5 and Pt6 clusters are the transition from
the 2D to the 3D structure; and the Pt7 cluster is the
smallest 3D structure.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, Pt-based catalysts have attracted particular attention
with respect to their catalytic performance toward the dehydrogenation
and cracking of hydrocarbons, ranging from energy-efficient and environmentally
friendly synthesis strategies to the replacement of petrochemical
feedstocks by abundant small alkanes.1−3 In this heterogeneous
catalysis, metal–support interaction is of great importance
because it can influence the heterostructural properties of metallic
nanoparticles (NPs), that is, the degree of dispersion, morphology,
and nucleation. Therefore, a fundamental question in catalytic research
is how to exploit metal–support interaction to optimize the
NP morphology to achieve good catalytic activity, selectivity, and
sintering suppression.

An important factor in Pt-based catalysis
is the size effect of
NPs. This has been nicely corroborated for the catalytic dehydrogenation
of hydrocarbons by Ptn0/+ cluster. Here, we discuss several
typical examples. Experimentally, it was discovered earlier that the
neutral Ptn clusters (n ≤ 24) can efficiently activate CH4, whereas Ptn (n = 2–5) clusters
are more reactive than the mononuclear platinum atom.4 Later, theoretically, it was reported that the neutral
clusters Pt2, Pt3, and Pt4 can activate
the first C–H bond of CH4 with small barriers, accompanied
by the breakage of the second C–H bond in CH4 as
the rate-determining step.5−7 More recently, we have studied
the competitive activation mechanism of C–H and C–C
bonds in C2H6 and/or C3H8 catalyzed by the Ptn (n = 1, 2, and 4) cluster8−12 and explained why the C–H insertion product is experimentally
observed while the C–C insertion product is not formed in observable
quantity8,9 and why both Pt2 and Pt4 clusters exhibit more promising catalytic performance toward C2H6 activation compared with the Pt atom.10,12 These experimental and theoretical studies emphasize that the size
of transition-metal clusters plays an important role in the catalytic
reactivity.

Another key factor in the Pt-based catalysis is
the metal–support
interaction that plays a crucial role in the deposition of size-selected
metal clusters onto a well-defined support surface. Tremendous progress
has been made in this direction. Experimentally, Vajda et al. deposited
size-selected Pt8–10 clusters on a porous aluminum
oxide support and found that they are over 40 times more active for
the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane than the conventional catalyst,
while retaining the high selectivity to propylene.2 Theoretically, several studies were devoted to understanding
the growth of Pt nanoclusters on supports such as α-Al2O3(0001),13 γ-Al2O3(100),14 γ-Al2O3(110),15 anatase TiO2(101),16−18 rutile TiO2(110),19 graphene,20−23 ceria CeO2(111),24 and boron
nitride (BN).25 The relatively large cohesive
energy of Pt makes it highly probable that atomic layer deposition
(ALD) will produce a dispersion of Pt NPs and formation of 3D islands
rather than thin films, as was found previously on several supports.13,16−18,24 However, the smallest
cluster size of NPs, above which the growth transforms from two-dimension
(2D) to three-dimension (3D), is generally the result of a delicate
interplay between the metal–metal and metal–substrate
interactions. These experimental and theoretical studies show that
the support plays a key role in the nucleation and morphology of the
Ptn cluster.

γ-Al2O3 is extensively used as the
support because of its acid–base properties and mechanical
and thermal resistance and plays an essential role in the catalytic
performance. It has been experimentally and theoretically reported
that about 70% of the exposed surface of γ-alumina can be represented
by a (110) termination with three-coordinated and four-coordinated
Al atoms.26,27 However, this surface is generally expected
to be strongly hydrated, even at high temperatures. Therefore, no
low-coordinated ions of the Al2O3(110) framework
are available for the interaction with the adsorbed transition-metal
particles.28 The remaining 30% of the exposed
surface are expected to feature mainly (111) and (001) terminations.26,27 The γ-Al2O3(001) surface is dominated
by five-coordinated Al atoms, with some four-coordinated Al atoms,
both of which are expected to be weaker Lewis acids.29 The γ-Al2O3(001) surface, as
the most stable surface, is assumed to interact mostly with the supported
NPs through low-coordinated anions of the support.28−30 So far, only
limited study has focused on the nucleation and growth of NPs on the
γ-Al2O3(001) surface.31,32 However, the nucleation and morphology of the Ptn cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface
is still not well-understood.

In this study, we will examine
the stability and nucleation of
different small Ptn (n = 1–8) clusters on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface by the density functional theory (DFT) method. The
goals are to find answers to the following four questions in particular:
(1) Which is the preferred adsorption configuration? (2) How do the
Ptn clusters bond to the γ-Al2O3(001) surface? (3) How does the metal–support
interaction depend upon size? and (4) Is there a transition from a
planar to a 3D structure and where does it occur?

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Gas-Phase Ptn Clusters
To understand the growth behavior
of Ptn cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface,
it is necessary to first describe the geometries and energies of gas-phase
Ptn clusters. For the gas-phase Ptn clusters, 1D, 2D, and 3D structures are
considered, and only the energetically preferred geometries and the
binding energy (EBE) are depicted in Figure S1. As shown in Figure S1, the Pt–Pt distances in the clusters are shorter
than that in the bulk structure (2.775 Å), which increase from
2.401 to 2.672 Å with n = 1–6, decrease
from 2.672 to 2.609 Å with n = 6–7, and
then increase from 2.609 to 2.621 Å with n =
7–8, far from the bulk value (2.775 Å). The calculated
bond distance of the dimer is 2.401 Å, which is close to the
experimental value of 2.333 Å.41 The
degree of bond contraction relative to the bulk follows an approximate n–1/3 (n = 1–6)
relationship,42 which has been characterized
experimentally for the Pt cluster by extended X-ray absorption fine
structure (EXAFS).43 As expected, the binding
energy increases as the cluster size increases because of increased
atomic coordination. The difference between the binding energy of
a cluster and the bulk binding energy scales approximately as n–1/3 (n = 1–8),
which is in good agreement with the reported result.42

2.2 Adsorption of Pt1–Pt4 Clusters—2D Growth
The side
and top views
of γ-Al2O3(001) are presented in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, there are two types
of Al atoms: four-coordinated and five-coordinated, denoted as Al4
and Al5, respectively. Moreover, there are two types of O atoms: one
connecting with one four-coordinated Al atom and two five-coordinated
Al atoms and another interacting with three five-coordinated Al atoms,
denoted as O2 and O3. By Hirshfeld analysis, the charges of Al4, Al5,
O2, and O3 are determined to be +0.562, +0.493, −0.334, and
−0.366, respectively. Taking into account the geometrical structure,
Al4 is expected to be far from the metal cluster, as it is located
in the hollow site. In addition, three possible adsorption sites can
be easily recognized, namely, Al5, O2, and O3. Table 1 summarizes the relevant structural parameters
and adsorption energies for the lowest energy configurations that
are most relevant to the nucleation process.

2.2.1 (Pt)1
For the adsorption
of a single Pt atom on the γ-Al2O3(001)
surface, the obtained most stable two configurations are depicted
in Figure 1.

As shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, the
preferential adsorption configuration is the atop-O3 site (Pt1-1)
with a binding energy of −1.67 eV/atom, which is 0.27 eV more
stable than the atop-O2 site (Pt1-2) with a binding energy of −1.40
eV/atom. Binding energies of the monomers and ordering of the different
adsorption sites can be rationalized by examining the optimum structures
and electronic properties. In the Pt1-1 configuration, the Pt atom
binds to O3 with a bond length of 1.988 Å and binds to two Al5
atoms with the average bond length of 2.608 Å. Similarly, in
the Pt1-2 configuration, the Pt atom connects to O2 with a bond length
of 1.993 Å and binds to two Al5 atoms with equal bond lengths
of 2.682 Å. It is apparent that there are two Pt–Al5 bonds
and one Pt–O3 bond in Pt1-1, and there are two Pt–Al5
bonds and one Pt–O2 bond in Pt1-2. The shorter bond lengths
of Pt–O and Pt–Al make Pt1-1 more stable than Pt1-2.
This can be ascribed to the fact that O3 (−0.366) is charged
more negatively than O2 (−0.334) on a pristine γ-Al2O3(001) surface. Charge analysis shows that there
is an electron transfer of 0.125e from Pt to γ-Al2O3(001) in Pt1-1 and an electron transfer of 0.107e in Pt1-2. The order of ET accords stability to the two
configurations. It is indicated that the atop-O3 site is more favorable
than the atop-O2 one. That is to say that the Pt atom interacts more
firmly with O3 than O2. This result may be ascribed to the more negative
charge on O3 than that on O2.

2.2.2 (Pt)2
On the basis of
Pt1/γ-Al2O3(001) configurations,
the introduction of the second Pt atom may form four possible configurations.
For the adsorption of a Pt2 cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, the obtained most stable two configurations
are depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Top and side views of the dimer adsorption configurations on the
γ-Al2O3(001) surface. The bond length
is in Å.

As shown in Table 1 and Figure 2, the
four stable configurations have a relative stabilization energy within
1.67 eV (see Table S1). The preferential
adsorption configuration is Pt2-1 with a binding energy of −2.77
eV/atom, which is about 0.83 eV more stable than Pt2-2, Pt2-3, and
Pt2-4, which have an equal binding energy of about −1.94 eV/atom.
Let us inspect their optimum structure and electronic properties.
As shown in Table 1 and Figure 2, in
the Pt2-1 configuration, the Pt dimer is positioned nearly across
the O3–O3 pair; whereas one Pt atom binds to two O3 atoms with
the average bond length of 2.085 Å, another Pt atom links to
two Al5 atoms with equal bond lengths of 2.604 Å. Next, in the
Pt2-2 configuration, the Pt dimer is adsorbed across the O2–O2–O2
pair, whereas each Pt atom connects to two O2 atoms with the average
bond length of 2.483 Å. Deformation energies mainly embody at
the γ-Al2O3(001) surface in the range
of 2.22–0.64 eV, whereas they vary little at the Pt2 cluster in the range of 0.20–0.04 eV. However, the Pt–Pt
bond length is elongated by about 0.07–0.28 Å. By charge
analysis, there is a charge transfer of 0.186e from
Pt2 to γ-Al2O3(001) in Pt2-1
and a charge transfer of 0.147e in Pt2-2.

2.2.3 (Pt)3
In the light of
Pt2/γ-Al2O3(001) configurations,
the introduction of the third Pt atom may result in six possible configurations.
For the adsorption of a Pt3 cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, the obtained most stable two configurations
are depicted in Figure 3. Six stable configurations are obtained with the relative energy
within about 1.10 eV (see Table S1).

Figure 3 Top and side
views of the trimer adsorption configurations on the
γ-Al2O3(001) surface. The bond length
is in Å.

As shown in Table 1 and Figure 3, the
lowest energy configurations are Pt3-1 and Pt3-2 with an equal binding
energy of −2.97 eV/atom. Now, it is necessary to investigate
their optimum structure and electronic properties. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 3, in Pt3-1, the Pt3 triangular plane is parallel to the γ-Al2O3(001) surface; whereas one Pt atom binds to one O3 atom with
the bond length of 2.159 Å, the other two Pt atoms link to two
Al5 atoms with equal bond lengths of 2.545 Å. Then, in Pt3-2,
the Pt3 triangular plane is perpendicular to the γ-Al2O3(001) surface through the vertex of the triangle;
whereas one Pt atom connects to two O3 atoms with the average bond
length of 2.130 Å, the other two Pt atoms are out of the γ-Al2O3(001) substrate. Hence, there are two Pt–Al5
bonds and one Pt–O3 bond in Pt3-1, and there are two Pt–O3
bonds in Pt3-2. It is indicated that the synergism of Pt with both
Al5 and O3 makes the Pt3-1 configuration more stable. Deformation
energies mainly reflect at the γ-Al2O3(001) surface in the range of 1.50–0.56 eV, with hardly any
at the Pt3 cluster. However, the average Pt–Pt bond
length is elongated by about 0.01–0.07 Å. In the light
of charge analysis, there is a charge transfer of 0.257e from Pt3 to γ-Al2O3(001)
in Pt3-1 and a charge transfer of 0.069e in Pt3-2.

2.2.4 (Pt)4
According to the
Pt3/γ-Al2O3(001) configurations,
the introduction of the fourth Pt atom may bring about eight possible
configurations. For the adsorption of a Pt4 cluster on
the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, the obtained
most stable two configurations are depicted in Figure 4. Eight stable configurations are obtained
with the relative stabilization energy within about 1.21 eV (see Table S1).

Figure 4 Top and side views of the tetramer adsorption
configurations on
the γ-Al2O3(001) surface. The bond length
is in Å.

As shown in Table 1 and Figure 4, the
most stable configuration is Pt4-1 with a binding energy of −3.23
eV/atom, followed by Pt4-2 with an almost equal binding energy of
−3.04 eV/atom. Next, let us discuss their optimum structure
and electronic properties. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 4, in Pt4-1, the Pt4 cluster is adsorbed
as a symmetric boatlike species on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface; whereas one Pt atom links to two O3 atoms and
the second Pt atom links to two O2 atoms, with the average bond length
of 2.297 Å, the remaining two Pt atoms link to two Al5 atoms
with equal bond lengths of 2.565 Å. Then, in Pt4-2, the Pt4 tetrahedral pyramid is deposited on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface; whereas one Pt atom connects to two O3
atoms, the second Pt atom connects to one O2 atom, the third Pt atom
connects to one Al5 atom, and the fourth one is in the second layer,
with average bond lengths of 2.163 Å for Pt–O and 2.631
Å for Pt–Al. Hence, there are two Pt–Al5 bonds,
two Pt–O3 bonds, and two Pt–O2 bonds in Pt4-1, and there
are one Pt–Al5 bond, two Pt–O3 bonds, and one Pt–O2
bond in Pt4-2. In view of the charge analysis, there is a charge transfer
of 0.256e from Pt4 to γ-Al2O3(001) in Pt4-1 and a charge transfer of 0.157e in Pt4-2.

In addition, the temperature effect was
taken into account on the
size and shape of the typical Pt4 cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, which may be the transition of
2D to 3D. The 2D Pt4-1 configuration is more stable than the 3D Pt4-2
configuration below 75 K, whereas the 3D Pt4-2 configuration is more
stable than the 2D Pt4-1 configuration above 75 K (see Figure S12).

2.3 Adsorption
of Pt5 and Pt6 Clusters—2D–3D
Transition
2.3.1 (Pt)5
In line with the
Pt4/γ-Al2O3(001) configurations,
the introduction of the fifth Pt atom may give eight possible configurations.
For the adsorption of a Pt5 cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, the obtained most stable two configurations
are depicted in Figure 5. Eight stable configurations are obtained with the relative energy
within about 1.18 eV (see Table S1).

Figure 5 Top and side
views of the pentamer adsorption configurations on
the γ-Al2O3(001) surface. The bond length
is in Å.

As shown in Table 1 and Figure 5, the
preferable lowest energy configuration is Pt5-1 with a binding energy
of −3.31 eV/atom, followed by Pt5-2 with a binding energy of
−3.26 eV/atom. Now, let us examine their optimum structure
and electronic properties. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 5, in Pt5-1, one Pt atom attaches to two O3 atoms, three
Pt atoms attach to three Al5 atoms, and the fifth Pt atom is in the
second layer, with average bond lengths of 2.073 Å for Pt–O
and 2.650 Å for Pt–Al. Afterward, in Pt5-2, one Pt atom
connects to two O3 atoms, one Pt atom connects to one O2 atom, three
Pt atoms connect to three Al5 atoms, with average bond lengths of
2.241 Å for Pt–O and 2.611 Å for Pt–Al. Hence,
there are three Pt–Al5 bonds and two Pt–O3 bonds in
Pt5-1, and there are three Pt–Al5 bonds, two Pt–O3 bonds,
and two Pt–O2 bonds in Pt5-2. The reason that Pt5-2 is 0.23
eV higher in energy than Pt5-1 may be attributed to the longer bond
lengths of Pt–O and Pt–Pt. In view of the charge analysis,
there is a charge transfer of 0.415e from Pt5 to γ-Al2O3(001) in Pt5-1 and
a charge transfer of 0.380e in Pt5-2.

2.3.2 (Pt)6
On the basis of
the Pt5/γ-Al2O3(001) configurations,
the introduction of the sixth Pt atom may produce six possible configurations.
For the adsorption of a Pt6 cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, the obtained most stable two configurations
are depicted in Figure 6. Eight stable configurations are obtained with the relative energy
within about 0.67 eV (see Table S1).

Figure 6 Top and side
views of the hexamer adsorption configurations on
the γ-Al2O3(001) surface. The bond length
is in Å.

As shown in Table 1 and Figure 6, the
most stable configuration is Pt6-1 with a binding energy of −3.40
eV/atom, followed by Pt6-2 with a binding energy of −3.39 eV/atom.
Now, let us look into their optimum structure and electronic properties.
As shown in Table 1 and Figure 6, in
Pt6-1, one Pt atom binds to two O3 atoms, four Pt atoms bind to four
Al5 atoms, and the sixth one is in the second layer, with average
bond lengths of 2.081 Å for Pt–O and 2.624 Å for
Pt–Al. In addition, in Pt6-2, one Pt atom links to two O3 atoms,
two Pt atoms link to two Al5 atoms, and the other three Pt atoms are
in the second layer, with average bond lengths of 2.107 Å for
Pt–O and 2.566 Å for Pt–Al. It is obvious that
Pt6-2 is only 0.08 eV higher in energy than Pt6-1. Such a low difference
in energy makes them to coexist thermodynamically. It is indicated
that the 2D–3D transition may take place in the Pt6 cluster. In a word, there are four Pt–Al5 bonds and two Pt–O3
bonds in Pt6-1, and there are two Pt–Al5 bonds and two Pt–O3
bonds in Pt6-2. Considering the charge analysis, there is a charge
transfer of 0.612e from Pt6 to γ-Al2O3(001) in Pt6-1 and a charge transfer of 0.360e in Pt6-2.

2.4 Adsorption of Pt7, Pt8, and Pt13 Clusters—3D Growth
2.4.1 (Pt)7
In the light of
the Pt6/γ-Al2O3(001) configurations,
the introduction of the seventh Pt atom may form eight possible configurations.
For the adsorption of a Pt7 cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, the obtained most stable two configurations
are depicted in Figure 7. Eight stable configurations are obtained with the relative stabilization
energy within about 1.37 eV (see Table S1).

Figure 7 Top and side views of the heptamer adsorption configurations on
the γ-Al2O3(001) surface. The bond length
is in Å.

As shown in Table 1 and Figure 7, the
preferable stable configuration is Pt7-1 with a binding energy of
−3.42 eV/atom, followed by Pt7-2 with a binding energy of −3.42
eV/atom. Now, let us inspect their optimum structure and electronic
properties. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 7, in Pt7-1, one Pt atom links to two O3 atoms, four Pt atoms link
to four Al5 atoms, and the other one is in the second layer, with
average bond lengths of 2.090 Å for Pt–O and 2.647 Å
for Pt–Al. Next, in Pt7-2, one Pt atom binds to two O3 atoms,
two Pt atoms bind to two O2 atoms, one Pt atom binds to the Al5 atom,
and the other three Pt atoms are in the second layer, with average
bond lengths of 2.174 Å for Pt–O and 2.568 Å for
Pt–Al. Moreover, there is a close relative energy between Pt7-1
and Pt7-2, indicating that they should coexist thermodynamically.
In short, there are four Pt–Al5 bonds and two Pt–O3
bonds in Pt7-1, and there are one Pt–Al5 bond, two Pt–O3
bonds, and two Pt–O2 bonds in Pt7-2. Concerning the charge
analysis, there is a charge transfer of 0.621e from
Pt7 to γ-Al2O3(001) in Pt7-1
and a charge transfer of 0.251e in Pt7-2.

As
depicted in Figure 7, the growth of a Pt heptamer island differs from the previous
cases. For the Pt heptamer, the preferable lowest energy configuration
is 3D in nature with five Pt atoms in the lower layer and two Pt atoms
in the upper layer, whereas for the previous Ptn/γ-Al2O3(001) (n < 7) heterostructures with at most one Pt atom in the second
layer. For comparison, the growth of Pt8 on rutile TiO2(110) and the growth of Pt5 on Mo2S(001)
showed a 3D nature with more than one atom residing in the second
layer.18,44

2.4.2 (Pt)8
In view of the
Pt7/γ-Al2O3(001) configurations,
the introduction of the eighth Pt atom may form four possible configurations.
For the adsorption of a Pt8 cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, the obtained most stable two configurations
are depicted in Figure 8. Four stable configurations are obtained with the relative stabilization
energy within about 2.21 eV (see Table S1).

Figure 8 Top and side views of the octamer adsorption configurations on
the γ-Al2O3(001) surface. The bond length
is in Å.

As shown in Table 1 and Figure 8, the
preferable lowest energy configuration is Pt8-1 with a binding energy
of −3.53 eV/atom, followed by Pt8-2 with a binding energy of
−3.51 eV/atom. Next, let us examine their optimum structure
and electronic properties. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 8, in Pt8-1, one Pt atom links to two O3 atoms, one
Pt atom links to one O2 atom, four Pt atoms link to four Al5 atoms,
and the other two Pt atoms are in the second layer, with average bond
lengths of 2.105 Å for Pt–O and 2.608 Å for Pt–Al.
Alternatively, in Pt8-2, one Pt atom binds to two O3 atoms, two Pt
atoms link to two O2 atoms, two Pt atoms link to two Al5 atoms, and
the other three Pt atoms are in the second layer, with average bond
lengths of 2.348 Å for Pt–O and 2.625 Å for Pt–Al.
In addition, there are four Pt–Al5 bonds, two Pt–O3
bonds, and one Pt–O2 bond in Pt8-1, and there are two Pt–Al5
bonds, two Pt–O3 bonds, and two Pt–O2 bonds in Pt8-2.
In view of the charge analysis, there is a charge transfer of 0.607e from Pt8 to γ-Al2O3(001) in Pt8-1 and a charge transfer of 0.439e in
Pt8-2, which may reflect the stability of the two configurations.

2.4.3 (Pt)13
Because the Pt13 cluster exhibits the highest stability among small clusters
because of its “magic number” on various substrates,
such as defective BN nanosheet25 or defective
graphene,45−47 it is very necessary to examine the adsorption of
the Pt13 cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface. On the basis of the growth trend of Ptn (n = 1–8) on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, the most stable 3D configuration
of Pt13/γ-Al2O3(001) was designed.
For the adsorption of a Pt13 cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, the obtained stable configuration
is depicted in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Top and side views of the Pt13 adsorption configuration
on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface. The bond
length is in Å.

As shown in Table 1 and Figure 9, the
preferable lowest energy configuration is Pt13-1 with a binding energy
of −3.76 eV/atom. In Pt13-1, one Pt atom links to two O3 atoms,
two Pt atoms link to one O2 atom, four Pt atoms link to four Al5 atoms,
and the other six Pt atoms are in the second layer, with average bond
lengths of 2.164 Å for Pt–O and 2.653 Å for Pt–Al.
Alternatively, in view of the charge analysis, there is a charge transfer
of 0.661e from Pt13 to γ-Al2O3(001).

2.5 Nucleation
of the Ptn Cluster on γ-Al2O3(001)
As shown in Table 1, the deformation energy exists mainly on
the γ-Al2O3(001) surface other than the
Ptn moiety. The trends of energy for the
most stable configuration
Ptn/γ-Al2O3(001) (n = 1–8) are drawn in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Binding energies (EBE), nucleation
energies (Enuc), metal–support
interaction energies (EMS), cohesive energies
(ECE), γ-Al2O3(001) deformation energies (ΔEdef,Al2O3), and a charge transfer for the most stable
configuration of the Ptn cluster on the
γ-Al2O3(001) surface.

As shown in Figure 10, with the increase in the Ptn cluster
size on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, both
the binding energy (EBE) and the cohesive
energy (ECE) decrease and the difference
between ECE and EBE gradually lessens. Furthermore, the binding energies are
smaller than cohesive energies. It is indicated that these clusters
could cause diffusion. For the Pt1 cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, the diffusion barrier is calculated
to be 0.16 eV (see Figure S10).

Alternatively,
both the γ-Al2O3(001)
deformation (ΔEdef,Al2O3) and the metal–support interaction (EMS) energies display an odd–even oscillation
pattern. That is, the γ-Al2O3(001) deformation
energy (ΔEdef,Al2O3) increases with the increase in the Ptn cluster size for both odd and even sizes, whereas it is higher
for an even Ptn cluster size than for
its adjacent odd ones. Thereupon, the metal–support interaction
(EMS) energy decreases with the increase
in the Ptn cluster size for both odd and
even sizes, whereas it is lower for an even size than for its adjacent
odd sizes. That is to say, the odd–even oscillation pattern
for ΔEdef,Al2O3 has an effect on the change in the metal–support interaction
energy. Moreover, the nucleation energy (Enuc) also shows an odd–even oscillation pattern, in which the
nucleation energy of the even Ptn cluster
size is lower than that of its adjacent odd ones.

Furthermore,
taking into account both the metal–support
interaction (EMS) and the metal–metal
interaction (ΔEbond,Ptn) energies, one can see that the EMS is lower than ΔEbond,Ptn for n = 1–4
and higher for n = 5–8. Both the metal–surface
and metal–metal interactions are competitive, which control
the nanoparticle morphology transition from 2D to 3D. It is indicated
that the cluster adopts a 2D nature for a small number of metal particles
(n < 5) when the metal–support interaction
governs, and the cluster gradually approaches a 3D morphology characteristic
for a large number of metal particles (n > 5)
when
the metal–metal interaction dominates. These results can be
echoed by the obtained stable geometric structures, as mentioned earlier.
Combining with the results of geometric structures, one can conclude
that Pt4-1 is the most stable 2D structure, Pt5-1 and Pt6-1 are the
transition from 2D to 3D, and Pt7-1 is the smallest 3D structure with
two Pt atoms in the second layer. Then, we will discuss the electronic
properties for Pt4-1 and Pt7-1 configurations infra.

As shown
in Figure 10, the
ET from the Ptn cluster to γ-Al2O3(001) increases with the increase in the Ptn cluster size number (n =
1–6) and varies little for n = 6–8.
The DOS and the corresponding contour plots of the differential charge
density for γ-Al2O3(001), Pt1-1, Pt4-1,
Pt7-1, and Pt13-1 are depicted in Figure 11.

Figure 11 Density of states (DOS) and the corresponding
contour plots of
the differential charge density for γ-Al2O3(001), Pt1-1, Pt4-1, Pt7-1, and Pt13-1. The Fermi level is set as
zero in black dotted lines. The charge accumulation region is gray,
and the charge depletion region is yellow. The isovalue is 0.05e Å–3.

As shown in Figure 11, for γ-Al2O3(001), the DOS is
characterized
with a sharp peak from the O 2p orbital in the vicinity of the Fermi
level (EF) and two sharp peaks from the
Al 3p orbital in the range of 4.0–6.0 eV. For Pt1-1, Pt4-1,
Pt7-1, and Pt13-1, it is apparent that there is a sharp peak from
the Pt 5d orbital near EF, indicating
strong hybridization between the Pt 5d orbital and the O 2p orbital.
Furthermore, for Pt1-1 and Pt4-1, the O 2p orbital peaks around the EF of the substrate are all shifted to low energy
levels, whereas they hardly vary for Pt7-1 and Pt13-1. This phenomenon
strengthens that there is a stronger metal–support interaction
in Pt1-1 and Pt4-1 than that in Pt7-1 and Pt13-1. In addition, the
Al 3p sharp peaks gradually decrease from γ-Al2O3(001), Pt1-1, and Pt4-1 to Pt7-1 and disappear at Pt13-1.
It is indicated that the Pt–Al interaction enhances by degrees
with the increase in the Ptn cluster size
after the Ptn cluster adsorption on γ-Al2O3(001). This result is in good agreement with
the geometric features as before. The above interactions of Pt–O
and Pt–Al can be explained by the fact that there is a clear
ET from the O2– 2p occupied orbital to the Pt 5d*
empty orbital and electron back donation from the Pt 5d occupied orbital
to the Al3+ 3p* empty orbital in the deposited Ptn cluster on the γ-Al2O3(001) surface, as depicted in Figure 10. The net result of the ET makes the Ptn moiety positively charged and the γ-Al2O3(001) moiety negatively charged. As shown in Figure 10, the electron
density difference map reveals that some Pt orbitals are depleted
upon adsorption on the surface. This depletion is balanced by an increase
in the electron density of the Pt–O and/or Pt–Al bonds
on the interfacial γ-Al2O3(001).

3 Conclusions
The stability and nucleation of different
small Ptn (n = 1–8,
13) clusters on
the γ-Al2O3(001) surface have been examined
using DFT. The following conclusions can be drawn from the present
study.

There are 47 stable configurations Ptn/γ-Al2O3(001) (n = 1–8)
obtained, in which the preferable adsorption configuration is ascertained
for each size of the Ptn cluster on the
γ-Al2O3(001) surface. For the most stable
configuration Ptn/γ-Al2O3(001) (n = 1–8, 13), Ptn clusters bond to the γ-Al2O3(001) surface through Pt–O and Pt–Al bonds
at the expense of the electron density of the Ptn cluster.

On the γ-Al2O3(001)
surface, with the
increase in the Ptn cluster size, all
γ-Al2O3(001) deformations, metal–support
interactions, and the nucleation energies exhibit an odd–even
oscillation pattern. The metal–support interaction and the
nucleation energies of an even Ptn cluster
size are lower than those of its adjacent odd ones, whereas the γ-Al2O3(001) deformation energy of an even Ptn cluster size is higher than that of its adjacent
odd ones.

Both the metal–surface and metal–metal
interactions
are competitive, which control the nanoparticle morphology transition
from 2D to 3D. On the γ-Al2O3(001) surface,
when the metal–support interaction predominates, smaller clusters
such as Pt1, Pt2, Pt3, and Pt4 exhibit a planar 2D nature. On the other hand, when the metal–metal
interaction governs, larger clusters such as Pt5, Pt6, Pt7, Pt8, and Pt13 prefer
a two-layer structure with one or more Pt atoms on the top layer not
interacting with the support directly. Herein, the Pt4 cluster
is the most stable 2D structure, Pt5 and Pt6 clusters are the transition from 2D to 3D, and the Pt7 cluster is the smallest 3D structure.

4 Computational
Details
All calculations were performed by using Materials
Studio 7.0 package.33 The generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) with the
PW91 functional34 is chosen together with
the doubled numerical
basis set and polarization basis set (DNP),35 using the DMol3 program.36 For the 5d transition-metal atom Pt, the scalar relativistic effects
(density functional semicore pseudopotentials, DSPP) were considered
for its core electrons.37 The DNP basis
sets have been successfully employed in the deposition of Pt clusters
on the defective hexagonal BN (h-BN) sheets.25 For the geometrical optimization, the forces imposed on each atom
were converged to be less than 0.002 hartree/Å, the total energy
was converged to be less than 1.0 × 10–6 hartree,
and the displacement convergence was less than 5 × 10–3 Å. The k-point sampling scheme is the Monkhorst–Pack
grid of 2 × 2 × 1. A Fermi smearing of 0.005 hartree for
orbital occupancy was used to improve the computational performance.

In addition, the properties of the isolated Ptn clusters were calculated using a 15 × 15 × 15 Å
cubic unit cell. In the present study, bulk parameters of the γ-Al2O3(001) surface model were first optimized according
to the values of the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD).38 The supercell was obtained by a lattice constant
of a = 7.887 Å, and a periodically reproduced
slab supercell was then applied to simulate the γ-Al2O3(001) surfaces. The stoichiometry of the slab is restricted
to Al2O3, with 32 aluminum and 48 oxygen atoms.
The simulation cell dimensions were fixed to a = b = 11.15 Å, c = 24.02 Å, and
α = β = γ = 90°, including three Al–O
layers and two tetrahedral Al layers. The top two floors up and down
are symmetrical. The vacuum region was set to 20 Å to separate
the slabs in the direction perpendicular to the surface. For the optimization
of the adsorption site, both the adsorbed Ptn cluster and all atoms of the uppermost layer of the γ-Al2O3 support were relaxed, whereas the remaining
atoms of the support were fixed. The charge transfer was calculated
using the Hirshfeld method.39 The electron
density difference was computed using the CASTEP program available
in Materials Studio 7.0 package.40 To gain
insight into the metal–metal stabilizing interactions of Ptn on the γ-Al2O3(001) substrate, the binding energy (EBE) per Pt is defined by using eq i i  where EPtn/Al2O3 is the energy
of the Ptn/Al2O3 heterostructure in the optimum geometry, EAl2O3 is the energy of the pristine γ-Al2O3(001), and EPt is
the energy of an isolated Pt atom in the ground triplet state. In
this expression of the binding energy, the negative values of EBE indicate stable adsorption configurations.

The energy (EMS) of the metal-slab
stabilizing interactions is computed by using eq ii ii  where the second term ΔEdef,Al2O3 (positive) measures the
γ-Al2O3(001) deformation energy, defined
as the energy penalty to deform γ-Al2O3(001) into the structure adopted in the bonding configuration, by
using eq iii iii  and the third term ΔEbond,Ptn (negative)
is defined
as the energy gain owing to the metal–metal bonds by using eq iv iv  where EPtn is the lowest Ptn cluster in energy on the surface.

The average cohesive
energy, ECE, for
the Ptn cluster in the gas phase is estimated
by using eq v v  where  is the total energy of the Ptn cluster in the gas phase and EPt is the total energy of a single Pt atom.

In addition, the
Ptn cluster deformation
energy (ΔEdef,Ptn), which is associated with the deformation in the structure
of the Ptn cluster between the gas phase
and the adsorbed state, is characterized by using eq vi vi  

Furthermore, to better understand the nucleation
or growth of Ptn clusters on the γ-Al2O3(001) substrate, the nucleation energy (Enuc), which is the energy gained (or lost) in
combining
an adsorbed monomer with a Ptn–1 cluster to form a Ptn cluster, is defined
as follows vii
