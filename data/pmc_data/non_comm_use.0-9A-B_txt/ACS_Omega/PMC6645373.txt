Ru/CexAly catalysts were synthesized
with impregnation of RuCl3 aqueous solution on CexAly (Al2O3–CeO2) and used in 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE)
oxidation. Characterization
by X-ray diffraction, Raman, NH3-temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD), CO2-TPD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
and H2-temperature-programmed reduction indicates that
CeO2 exists as a form of face-centered cubic fluorite structure,
whereas the chemical states and the structure of Ru species are dependent
on the Ce content. The reducibility and acidity of catalysts increase
with Ce/Ce + Al ratio. However, the latter is promoted only in a Ce/Ce
+ Al range of 0–0.25 and then decreases quickly. Ru/CexAly catalysts
have considerable activity for 1,2-DCE combustion. TOFRu of 1,2-DCE oxidation increases with strong acid, which is ascribed
to a synergy of reducibility and acidity. Ru greatly inhibits the
chlorination through the decreases in both Cl deposition and CH2=CHCl formation. High stability of Ru/Ce10Al90 maintains at 280 °C for at least 25 h with CO2 selectivity of 99% or higher. In situ Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy indicates that 1,2-DCE dissociates to form ClCH2–CH2O– species, which is an intermediate
species for the production of CH3CHO and CH2=CHCl, the former responsible for deep oxidation.

1 Introduction
Chlorinated
volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) continue to attract
considerable public concern because of their persistence in the environment,
bioaccumulation in the tissues, and potential toxicity as carcinogens
and teratogens.1 CVOCs are released together
with other unintentionally persistent organic pollutants from thermal
process such as incinerators and metal industries.2 Therefore, it is important to develop convenient, practical,
and cost-effective methods to remove atmospheric CVOCs. Among various
available techniques, catalytic combustion has been proven to be a
promising and emerging technology for the removal of CVOCs in waste
gases because of its highly effective character (between 250 and 550
°C) and low consumption of energy (without additional fuels)
when compared to a thermal process.3

For catalytic combustion of CVOCs, ceria-based catalysts were highly
active because of their easily breaking C–Cl bonds and possessing
good redox performance. In our previous work,4−6 a series of
ceria-based catalysts, that is, MnO2–CeO2, TiO2–CeO2, and V–CeO2, were found to be active catalysts for chlorinated aromatic oxidation.
However, many research studies on Ce-based catalysts were devoted
to ceria nanoparticles. For numerous industrial practices, Al2O3–CeO2 mixed oxides were very
important materials used for coating monolithic supports of the industrial
catalysts. There were wide studies on the relation of preparation
methods with surface properties of Al2O3–CeO2 catalysts. For three-way catalysts, Ce species in Al2O3–CeO2 coating promoted redox
capability, oxygen storage, the dispersion, and the resistance to
the sintering of noble metals. However, Cl species produced during
the decomposition of CVOCs adsorbed favorably on oxygen vacancies
of CeO2 so that the adsorption and activation of oxygen
molecules became difficult.7 Generally,
the stable activity of Ce-based catalysts was available at high temperature
where Cl species desorbed as HCl7 or Cl2. The chlorination of CVOCs on CeO2 cannot be eliminated
completely within the reaction temperature.5,6 Moreover,
some containing-chlorine organic compounds were less reactive on chlorinated
Al2O3.8,9 Chlorine deposited on
Al2O3 decreased the number and the acidic strength
of Lewis sites.10 Recently, it was reported
that the incorporation of precious metals could promote greatly the
performance of Al2O3–CeO2.
For example, Pt catalysts supported on Al2O3–CeO2 were highly active and stable during dichloromethane
(DCM) oxidation.11 As known, Ru species
possessed high activity for oxidation–reduction and good resistance
to poisoning by Cl,12 and thus Ru-modified
transition-metal oxide catalysts were widely used in oxidation of
CVOCs. It was found that the electron transfer from Ru 3d to Ce 4f
could occur, and thus, Ru/CeO2 catalysts presented high
reducibility.6 In order to design effective
industrial catalysts for oxidation of CVOCs, it is desirable to study
the effects of reducibility, acidity, and surface oxygen on the catalytic
performance of Ru/CeO2–Al2O3 catalysts. In this work, Ru/CexAly catalysts were prepared with impregnation
of RuCl3 aqueous solution on CexAly (Al2O3–CeO2) and investigated in 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) oxidation
kinetically and by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalyst
Characterization
2.1.1 Physical Properties
The pore distribution
curves calculated with the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method
according to the adsorption branch of N2 sorption isotherms
of CexAly samples
present two kinds of pores with radii of 3–4 and 6–7
nm (Table 1, Figure S1a). With the incorporation of Ce into
Al2O3, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) area decreases gradually from 330 m2/g for Al2O3 to 142 m2/g for Ce75Al25, indicating that the contribution from Al2O3 to matrix decreases. CeO2 presents the smallest
area, 86 m2/g. Similar N2 sorption isotherms
are observed on Ru/CexAly samples (Figure S1b). However,
Ru loading decreases the area by 14–26%, depending on the Ce
content (Table 1).
On X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CexAly samples with the Ce/Ce + Al ratio
below 0.5, the diffraction peaks ascribed to γ-Al2O3 are observed (JCPDS 10-0425) (Figure 1a). With further increase in the Ce content,
these peaks disappear and the peaks ascribed to the cubic fluorite
structure become strong. The size of CeO2 particles calculated
according to Scherrer equation applying ⟨111⟩ crystal
plane decreases with the Al content (Table 1). The area calculated according to the percentage
contribution from CeO2 and Al2O3 (the
values within parentheses) is smaller, suggesting that there is some
interaction between CeO2 and Al2O3. With Ru loading, new diffraction peaks are observed at 28.1°,
35.1°, 40.0°, and 54.3°, corresponding to the RuO2 phase (Figure 1b). At the same time, the diffraction peaks of cubic fluorite shift
slightly to high angles. A part of Ru4+ ions (rRu4+ = 0.62 Å) can enter the lattice of
CeO2 (rCe4+ = 0.94
Å), resulting in the formation of Ru–O–Ce structure
and thus the reduction of lattice parameters (Table 1). Moreover, CeO2 particles become
small (Table 1) because
of the distortion of lattice by Ru–O–Ce species.6 The size of RuO2 particles is in the
range of 22–28 nm, which is consistent with the disappearance
of 2–30 nm pores. The pore volume of Ru/CexAly samples becomes significantly
small (Figure S1b), suggesting that some
Ru nanoparticles stack the pores of CexAly particles (Table 1). Total Ru content determined by inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES) is 1.8
± 0.20 wt % (Table 1).

On Raman
spectra of CexAly, there appears a strong band at 460 cm–1 that is ascribed to F2g mode of fluorite phase. Several
weak bands are resulted from second-order transverse acoustic (2TA)
mode (258 cm–1), defect-induced (D) mode (597 cm–1), and second-order longitudinal optical (2LO) mode
(1172 cm–1) (Figure 2a).13 The νF2g band is due to oxygen lattice vibrations.14,15 The band at 598 cm–1, ascribed to oxygen vacancy,
becomes strong with Ce content. With the presence of Ru, the νF2g band is splitted into 450 and 460 cm–1 (Figure 2b), which
should be related to the formation of Ru–O–Ce species.
For RuO2, the bands are due to Eg (528 cm–1), A1g (644 cm–1), and
B2g modes and (716 cm–1)16 cannot be observed in the spectra of Ru/CexAly samples (Figure 2b), probably because
of them being too weak, compared to the bands assignable to CeO2. There appear two new bands at 697 and 930–980 cm–1, which cannot be ascribed to RuO3 (800
cm–1), RuO4 (822–881 cm–1), RuO42– (808 cm–1), and hydrated RuO2 (380–440 and 590 cm–1).17−19 These bands grow in intensity with Ce content, probably
because of the formation of Ru–O–Ce.20 This phenomenon is similar to that observed on the Raman
spectra of Pt/CeO2 with the structure of Pt–O–Ce.21 Therefore, these new bands are reasonably ascribed
to the Ru–O–Ce bond. DFT calculation suggested that
the incorporation of Ru species made lattice oxygen become active
through the formation of longer Ru–O and Ce–O bonds
than those in CeO2 and RuO2 and thus promoted
oxygen vacancy.22 As shown in Figure 2a,b inset, the band
at 598–617 cm–1, ascribed to oxygen vacancy,
grows in intensity. It can be expected that Ru will promote greatly
the reducibility of CexAly samples. For Ru/CeO2, a broad band with
the center at 330 cm–1 can be ascribed to hydrated
RuO2.18

2.1.2 Chemical
States and Reducibility of Catalysts
Figure 3 presents
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of O 1s, Ce 3d, and
Ru 3d for the samples. Ru/Al2O3 exhibits two
Ru 3d5/2 peaks at 279.5 and 281.4 eV that are assigned
to Ru0 and Ru4+ species, respectively.23,24 With the addition of Ce, the Ru0 peak becomes weak with
the increase in the binding energy (BE) of Ru 3d5/2 (up
to 279.9 eV for Ru/Ce75Al25). Moreover, there
appears one more Ru 3d5/2 peak at 283.8 eV, which could
be assigned to Ru6+. Positively charged Ru species increases
with Ce/Ce + Al ratio and possesses 80% or more for the catalysts
with Ce/Ce + Al ratio higher than 0.25, of which Ru4+ dominants
(Table 2). Ru0 species is formed due to self-decomposition of RuO2 during
calcinations. It is reasonable to deduce that the interaction between
Al2O3 and Ru species is weak so that RuO2 anchoring on Al2O3 readily decomposes.
The Ru0 content of Ru/CexAly samples calculated according to those on
Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/CeO2 is significantly
higher than experimental values (Table 2). The composition data show that the Ru/Ce + Al ratio
increases with the Ce/Ce + Al ratio, that is, Ru content on the surface
increases with Ce (Table 2), suggesting that a strong interaction between CeO2 and Ru species leads to high dispersion of Ru species. On O 1s spectra
of Ru/Al2O3, the oxygen species with a BE of
530.4 eV is assigned to lattice oxygen of Al2O3. For Ru/CexAly samples, there appears a new peak at about 528.9 eV, assigned
to lattice oxygen of CeO225. At the Ce/Ce +
Al ratio of 0.25–1, the peak at 531.1 eV can be ascribed to
adsorbed oxygen, hydroxyl, and carbonate.25 Ru/CeO2 presents the largest content of surface oxygen,
probably because of its best formation of Ru–O–Ce. This
phenomenon was observed during the incorporation of other ions into
the CeO2 lattice.26 On Ce 3d
spectra, 10 peaks resulting from the pairs of spin–orbit doublets
are identified through deconvolution. Six peaks at 916.6, 907.7, 900.1,
897.6, 888.7, and 882.4 eV arise from Ce4+ contributions
and four peaks at 902.6, 898.7, 884.6, and 880.2 eV from Ce3+ contributions.6 Ce3+ species
exist in the CeO2 phase or in the form of Ce3+–O–Al. The amount of Ce3+ is estimated to
be in a range of 20–23%.

H2 temperature-programmed
reduction (H2-TPR)
tests were carried out to investigate the reducibility of CexAly and Ru/CexAly samples within 100–800
°C (Figure 4).
For CexAly samples, the reduction of surface CeO2 occurs mainly
within 300–650 °C (Figure 4a), which is attributed to the abstraction of active
oxygen and the reduction of surface Ce4+ to Ce3+.25 H2 consumption is proportional
to Ce/Ce + Al ratio. With the incorporation of Ru, there appear two
or three reduction peaks at different temperatures, depending on the
Ce content (Figure 4b). For Ru/Al2O3, one reduction peak at 230
°C and one weak shoulder peak on the side of low temperature
are observed, which is similar to the result obtained over Ru/SiO2.27 The corresponding H2 consumption is 0.35 and 0.11 mmol/g. On the basis of RuO2 + 2H2 → Ru0 + 2H2O, the
theoretical H2 consumption for the reduction of 1.8 wt
% Ru for Ru/Al2O3 is 0.356 mmol/g, indicating
that Ru species in bulk is composed mainly of Ru4+ and
Ru6+, although XPS analysis shows that 38% Ru species near
the surface exists in Ru0. Ru/CeO2 is reduced
initially at 64 °C, and the peak temperature is 114 °C,
which can be related to the reduction of RuOx clusters or nanoparticles. The second peak at 161 °C
is resulted from the reduction of Ru–O–Ce species. H2 consumption for these two peaks is calculated to be 0.392
mmol/g, near to the theoretical value of Ru4+ reduction.
The third peak at 178 °C is related to the reduction of surface-active
oxygen and Ce4+ ions with H2 consumption of
0.46 mmol/g, closed to that of CeO2, 0.512 mmol/g. Moreover,
the reduction temperature shifts from 300 °C for pure CeO2 to 178 °C, indicating that Ru species increases greatly
the reducibility of CeO2, probably through the spillover
of atomic hydrogen from metallic Ru or relaxing Ce–O bond strongly
bounded with Ru species (Ru–O–Ce), similar to Au/CeO2.28 Lowering the Ce/Ce + Al ratio,
the reduction shifts to high temperature gradually, indicating that
the interaction of Ru with CeO2 makes Ru become more readily
reduced, and the Ru–O–Ce bordered by more Ce–O–Ce
maybe possesses better reducibility.

2.2 Acidity
and Basicity
NH3 temperature-programmed desorption
(NH3-TPD) profiles
of CexAly samples
are shown in Figure S2a. Temporarily, the
sections at 100–275 °C and 275–450 °C are
noted as NH3 desorption from weak and moderate strong acidic
sites, respectively, and the area under profiles corresponds to ammonia
amount.29 As shown in Table 1, the samples with the Ce/Ce
+ Al ratio below 0.25 present a similar total amount of acid but the
strong acid increases with Ce content by 20–60% and approaches
the maximum over Ce25Al75. As mentioned previously,
the crystal structure of mixed oxides, such as Ce1–xTixO2, became
defective, which is resulted from the increase in electronic unbalance
through the modification of Ti–O and Ce–O bond length,
and as a result, the acidity is promoted. Moreover, CeO2 is a basic solid, and thus further increase in Ce makes the acidity
of CexAly samples
to decrease quickly. Py-FTIR spectra present the peaks at ca. 1441,
1574, and 1601 cm–1 which can be ascribed to the
adsorption of pyridine at Ce3+/Ce4+ or Al3+ Lewis acid sites (Figure S4).30 The incorporation of Ru modifies the acidity
of samples to a small extent (Table 2, Figure S2b).

For
CexAly samples,
there appears one peak at
140–175 °C on CO2-TPD profiles (Figure S3a), ascribed to CO2 desorption
from weak basic sites. With further increase in Ce content, the second
CO2 desorption begins at 350 °C and the intensity
becomes strong. Obviously, Ce species contributes mainly to strong
basic sites. The total base amount reaches the most at Ce/Ce + Al
of 0.5 (Table 1). The
modification in length of Al–O and Ce–O bonds also contributes
to basicity. However, with the presence of Ru, a great decrease in
basicity can be observed, especially for the samples with low Ce content,
the amount of base drops by 90% (Figure S3b, Table 1). During
the impregnation with ruthenium(III) chloride aqueous solution, a
part of basic Al–OH or Ce–OH species can be substituted
by chloride ions. XPS data confirm the existence of a significant
amount of Cl species on the fresh Ru/CexAly samples.

2.3 Activity
of Catalysts
Figure 5 shows the activity of CexAly and Ru/CexAly catalysts
for 1,2-DCE oxidation as a function of temperature. Al2O3 presents low oxidation activity, and the conversion
to COx (CO + CO2) (the mole
number of 1,2-DCE transformed into COx/total mole number of 1,2-DCE entering into the reactor) cannot reach
25% up to 450 °C (Figures 5a and S6). For CexAly catalysts, 1,2-DCE conversion
curves shift to low temperature. As known, C–Cl dissociation
on Lewis acidic sites to form chlorinated methoxy, as the first step
of oxidation of DCM, occurred readily even at room temperature.31 In fact, the catalysts with low Ce content present
high activity for 1,2-DCE conversion (Figure S5). However, the main products below 300 °C are composed of 90%
of vinyl chloride (VC) (see later), which is less reactive because
of the conjugation of p-orbital of Cl atom with π-orbital of
C=C. With further increasing Ce content, T50 (the temperature needed for 50% conversion to COx) rises up, such as for Ce75Al25 and CeO2, to 374 and 396 °C, respectively
(Table 3). At 450 °C,
the conversion to COx over CexAly catalysts cannot
reach 90%. Additionally, the CO2/COx ratio increases quickly with Ce content because of CeO2’s high activity for oxidation. The CO2/COx ratio over Al2O3 is
below 58%, whereas those over the catalysts with high Ce content is
80% or higher (Figure 5a). Considering no activity at 310 °C over Al2O3, TOFCe according to the mole number of 1,2-DCE
converted per square meter per minute normalized by the Ce content
on the surface (Table 2) is used to compare the contribution from Ce species to activity.
As shown in Figure 5a inset, TOFCe increases directly with the content of
strong acid, indicating that Ce species cooperated with strong acidity
are more active for 1,2-DCE oxidation. Here, high reducibility of
Ce species and activation of VC on strong acid should be responsible
for high activity. Ce25Al75 has the highest
apparent oxidation activity, whose TOFCe is 0.79 μmol
m–2 min–1. With the incorporation
of 1.8 wt % Ru, T50 and T90 obtained over Ru/CexAly with Ce/Ce + Al of 0.10–0.25 decrease
to 287 and 322 °C, respectively (Table 3) and almost no CO is observed, really because
of a great increase in activity for oxidation. On the basis of the
fact that very small conversion to CO2 at 275 °C is
observed over CexAly catalysts (Figure 5a), the activity at 275 °C can be considered to correlate
with the Ru species or Ru–O–Ce species. TOFRu at 275 °C increases with the content of strong acid, and Ru/Ce25Al75 with the most strong acid presents the highest
TOFRu of 6.3 μmol m–2 min–1, which can be ascribed to the synergism between high reducibility
and considerable strong acidity. For Ru/Ce75Al25 and Ru/CeO2 with less strong acid, T90 increases up to 386–403 °C and TOFRu decreases down to 2.2–2.3 μmol m–2 min–1. The presence of Ru can increase the reducibility
of the catalysts, as shown in Figure 4, which is favorable for oxidation and removal of Cl
species from the surface,6 whereas strong
acid probably promotes the breaking of the second C–Cl to form
more reactive surface ethanediolate. Compromising surface area, acidity,
and reducibility, Ru/CexAly catalysts with the Ce/Ce + Al ratio of 0.10–0.25
present high apparent activity for complete oxidation of 1,2-DCE.

Without a significant
change in 1,2-DCE concentration in a range
of 10% conversion, Arrhenius reaction equation is applied to calculate
apparent activation energies (Ea’s)
with 95% confidence (Figure S7). Ea calculated from the rate for 1,2-DCE conversion
to COx decreases gradually with the increase
of Ce content. As shown in Table 3, Al2O3 and Ce5Al95 present high Ea of 235 kJ/mol,
whereas Ce75Al25 and CeO2, low Ea of 80.2 and 52.4 kJ/mol, respectively. Obviously,
the activity of CexAly catalysts is related to Ce species. Some containing-chlorine
organic compounds were less reactive on chlorinated Al2O3.8,9 Cl species adsorbed over Al2O3 decreased the number and the acidic strength
of the Lewis sites through the formation of Al–Cl species.10 CeO2 has been identified as highly
active catalysts for Deacon reaction (HCl + O2 →
Cl2 + H2O) at 350–450 °C, depending
on the surface oxygen content,32 and thus
the removal of Cl species from oxygen vacancy of CeO2 is
effective. With the incorporation of Ru, Ea for the oxidation of the catalysts with Ce/Ce + Al of 0–0.5
decreases greatly through both the increase in reducibility and the
reduction in Cl adsorption. However, Ru cannot present a significant
effect on Ea of Ce75Al25 and CeO2.

2.4 Distribution
of Products
Temperature-programmed
surface reaction (TPSR) experimental results show that the main products
are composed of COx, HCl, VC, and Cl2 (Figure S8). Cl2 is
produced through the oxidation of chloride ions. Over CexAly catalysts, Cl2 increases with Ce/Ce + Al ratio and the highest selectivity,
21%, is obtained at 391 °C. Over Al2O3,
Cl2 was almost not detected (Figure S9). Ru promotes the production of Cl2 over Ru/CexAly, especially
for the catalysts with low Ce content, on which 20% selectivity for
Cl2 is obtained at 300 °C. Main hydrocarbon product
containing Cl atom is VC. At 250–300 °C, the selectivity
for VC over the catalysts with low Ce content is higher than 90% (Figure 6), indicating that
the main reaction occurring on acidic sites is dehydrochlorination.
Generally, it was considered that Cl atom of 1,2-DCE interacted with
Lewis acidic site, and surface O2– species or hydroxyl
group nucleophilically attacked the corresponding carbon atom of 1,2-DCE,
which results in the dehydrochlorination.33 Raising temperature, VC can be further dehydrochlorinated on strong
acidic sites into ethyne (Figure S10).
For CexAly catalysts with high Ce content, the oxidation of VC becomes significant.
At the same time, the chlorination of VC is promoted and the highest
selectivity for cis- and trans-1,2-dichloroethlyene
and 1,1,2-trichloroethane (40%, at 300–400 °C) is observed
over CeO2 (Figures 6 and S10). According to the fact
that the initial chlorination temperatures are lower than those needed
for Deacon reaction, it can be deduced that Cl species adsorbed on
CeO2 species is responsible for the chlorination. In the
presence of Ru, the amount of chlorination products decreases to below
10 ppm (Figure S10), really because of
the decrease in Cl deposition (Table 3). The selectivity for VC decreases with Ce content,
and the highest VC content is below 10 ppm (Figure S10). For CexAly catalysts, the balance in carbon is 85% or higher, whereas
for Ru/CexAly catalysts, 99% carbon balance is available.

at different temperatures over CexAly and Ru/CexAly catalysts; the reaction
condition as described in Figure 5.

2.5 Catalyst
Stability
The stability
tests were carried out at different temperatures on the used catalysts
for standard evaluation for activity. CexAly catalysts present stable oxidation
activity at 300 °C within 600 min (Figures S11 and S12), indicating that Cl adsorbed on the surface can
reach equilibrium, probably because of high activity of Ce species
for chlorination and Deacon. For the representative samples, Al2O3 and CexAly were tested for another 25 h and no significant
changes in DCE conversion are observed. For Ru/Ce25Al75, the temperature needed for stable oxidation activity
within 25 h decreases down to 250 °C or lower (Figure 7). Raising the temperature
to 280 °C, there appears a 4 h induction for the activity of
1,2-DCE oxidation, within which the conversion increases from 40 to
68%. It can be seen in Figure S9 that 280
°C is the critical temperature for Deacon reaction, from which
the adsorbed Cl species can be removed as Cl2 from the
surface. Probably, the induction is related to Cl desorption with
time. Correspondingly, the chlorination product, 1,1,2-trichloroethane,
decreases from 2 ppm to zero. It is more important that Cl removal
directly leads to the increase in oxidation activity of catalysts.
The Cl adsorption can involve the sites for oxygen activation. For
Ru/Al2O3, the conversion at 250 °C decreases
gradually from 12% to almost zero within 15 h because of Cl strong
adsorption. A stable activity cannot be obtained until 280 °C.

2.6 Activity
in Wet Feed
The effect of
water on 1,2-DCE oxidation over CexAly and Ru/CexAly catalysts was investigated (Figure 8). For Al2O3 and Ce10Al90, the conversion is really
promoted by water and T50 decreases to
361 and 324 °C from >500 °C in dry feed, respectively.
Generally,
the desorption of Cl species in CVOC catalytic combustion could be
promoted effectively by water, and on the other hand, the surface
highly covered by hydroxyl groups is favorable for the interaction
of two Al–OH groups with two Cl atoms of 1,2-DCE molecule to
form ethanediolate, which is reactive to gas oxygen for Al2O3 and to surface oxygen for Ce10Al90. Thus, the formation of VC is reduced greatly (Figure S13). For CeO2, H2O can compete
more strongly for the adsorption sites, such as oxygen vacancy, with
oxygen molecules and it is expected that the activity decreases to
some extent. Using SRPES spectra, it was found that there still existed
hydroxyl groups on CeO2 up to 700 K.34 With the incorporation of Ru, the positive and negative
effects of water on 1,2-DCE conversion are observed, depending on
the temperature. When the temperature is lower than the critical value
for Deacon reaction, the activity is promoted through water’s
speeding the removal of Cl species. For Ru/Al2O3, Ru/Ce10Al90, and Ru/CeO2, T20 decreases to 269, 231, and 258 °C, respectively,
whereas T90 increases to 361, 342, and
>450 °C, respectively. Here, the decrease in strong acidity
makes
1,2-DCE activation to become difficult. As observed, water could reduce
the number of strong Brönsted acid sites for CB adsorption.35 On V2O5/TiO2 catalysts, water retarded CB adsorption through the decrease in
active sites.36 Moreover, the decrease
in surface oxygen due to competitive adsorption of water retards the
reaction to some extent. Product analyses (Figure S13) show that the chlorination can be inhibited greatly, and
only 1 ppm or less dichloroethlyene is observed over Ce10Al90 and CeO2. However, the selectivity for
1,1,2-trichloroethane is still high over Ru/CeO2, indicating
that 1,2-DCE is reactive for chlorination with Cl species adsorbed
on surface in wet feed.

2.7 In Situ FTIR Spectra
2.7.1 1,2-DCE
Adsorption
2.7.1.1 Al2O3
Figure 9a shows FTIR spectra
recorded at 50–450 °C for Al2O3 treated
with the flow of 1000 ppm 1,2-DCE balanced in Ar following flush with
Ar. At 50 °C, two strong bands at 2875 and 2945 cm–1 with one weak band at 3040 cm–1 are observed,
suggesting that there exist different types of C–H bonds. At
200 °C, the bands shift to high frequency, such as to 2899 and
2966 cm–1, because of the modification of chemical
environment. There appear negative bands centered at 3727 and 3686
cm–1, ascribed to surface hydroxyl groups. At the
same time, a weak positive band appears between 3630 and 3581 cm–1 (centered at about 3608 cm–1).
These spectra indicate that 1,2-DCE molecules adsorb on hydroxyl groups,
resulting in weaker hydrogen-bonded OHs.37,38 Raising temperature, the negative bands become strong.39 The reactivity of Al2O3 surface toward chlorinated organic compounds highly suggested that
the chloride ions can substitute surface OH groups, especially for
monocoordinated OH groups. Thus, the disappearance of hydroxyl bands
is related to the formation of Al–Cl bonds. In section of 1800–1000
cm–1, weak bands at 1160 and 1194 cm–1 (ascribed to ClCH2–CH2O−) are
observed at different temperatures. Compared with the bands for CH3–CH2O– (1075 and 1116 cm–1),40 these bands shift to higher frequency.
It was suggested that the nucleophilic substitution was the first
step in CH2Cl2 decomposition over Al2O3,31,32 during which Cl was abstracted
by a Lewis acidic site and the corresponding carbon bound with surface
oxygen, forming surface methoxy species and gas HCl.43 Here, the formation of ClCH2–CH2O– on Al2O3, as the first step of 1,2-DCE
adsorption, is a synergism between acidic Al3+ site for
abstracting of Cl atom and surface hydroxyl group for nucleophilic
attack. While the bands at 1400 and 1462 cm–1 (δas and δsym C–H of CClH2) are resulted from deformation modes of CClH2. Because
of the substitution of Cl for hydrogen, C–H bands shift to
high frequency slightly. At 50–200 °C, a strong band with
maximum at 1630–1665 cm–1 can be ascribed
to enolic species, similar to aldehyde adsorption on Al2O3 (not shown). Another evidence is that there appears
a strong band between 1644 and 1648 cm–1 in the
spectrum of syn-vinyl alcohol (CH2=CHOH) in the
gas phase.41,42 The bands in a range of 2939–2867
cm–1 ascribed to C=C and −CH–
are observed, confirming the production of enolic species.43 The bands at 1386, 1268, and 1605 cm–1 (assigned to δCH2, ρCH, and γC=C
of VC, respectively) become significant at 250 °C, where the
formation of VC is dominant in kinetic reaction. Additionally, the
new bands at 1680 and 1730 cm–1 (assigned to −C=O
group) appear. Generally, an adsorbed CH3CHO coordinated
to one Lewis acid site, CH3–CH=O–Al3+.33 The production of CH3CHO during 1,2-DCE decomposition at 260–360 °C was observed
by other group.44 Moreover, new bands at
1470 and 1356 cm–1 (assigned to monodentate bonded
carbonates),45 1268, 1425, and 1538 cm–1 (to asymmetric stretching vibration of carboxylates),31,46,47 and 1338–1356, and 1565
cm–1 (to carbonate bidentate) are observed at 250
°C or higher, and the formation of these species should involve
surface oxygen species, such as hydroxyl group. Additionally, other
bands at 1580 and 1475 cm–1, ascribed to the C=C
degenerate stretching vibrations of the aromatic ring,48 become stronger at 250 °C, where surface
enolic species disappears, indicating that enolic species could be
precursor of benzene species. Overbury et al. found with interest
5% benzene formation during the adsorption of CH3CHO on
shape-controlled CeO2 nanoparticles.

1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DCB)/Ar feed from 50 to 400 °C after
the treatment in Ar at 550 °C.

2.7.1.2 Ce10Al90 and Ru/Ce10Al90
For Ce10Al90, the bands ascribed to several types C–H bonds of 1,2-DCE
appear at 2875 and 2945 cm–1 (Figure 9b,c), consistent with those observed on Al2O3. The bands assigned to partial oxidized intermediates
such as monodentate bonded carbonates (1470 and 1348 cm–1), carbonate bidentate (1348 and 1565 cm–1), and
asymmetric stretching vibration of acetate (1268, 1425, and 1538 cm–1) are observed. The band splits in different sections
indicate 1,2-DCE adsorption on CeO2 and Al2O3. Compared with the spectra obtained on Al2O3, the bands at 1368, 1265, and 1605 cm–1, ascribed to VC, become weak. With Ru loading, the bands at 1400
and 1462 cm–1 (δsym and δas C–H of CClH2) resulted from deformation
modes of CClH2, 1386 and 1268 cm–1 (VC)
and 1630 cm–1 (enolic species), disappear. The negative
bands at 3708 cm–1 become weak, whereas the bands
at 1356 and 1560 cm–1 (carbonate bidentate) and
1730–1680 cm–1 (acetaldehyde species), strong,
indicating that the oxidation of 1,2-DCE is promoted by Ru.

2.7.2 1,2-DCE Oxidation
Adding oxygen
into the feed, the bands at 2879 and 2945 cm–1 at
100 °C over Al2O3 and Ce10Al90 are assigned to the vibration of C–H in 1,2-DCE (Figure 10a,b), similar to
the case of free-oxygen feed. At 200 °C, these bands almost remain
constant. Whereas the bands at 1160 and 1194 cm–1 assigned to ClCH2CHO become weak, and the one at 1630
cm–1 to surface enolic species, strong. Furthermore,
the bands at 1464–1469 and 1405–1434, and 1690–1750
cm–1, ascribed to −CH3 and carbonyl
group of aldehyde, grow in intensity greatly, indicating that aldehyde
species is an intermediate of 1,2-DCE oxidation, which is promoted
by the presence of gas oxygen. For Ru/Ce10Al90, the bands at 1160 and 1194 cm–1 are almost not
observed because of too weak intensity, whereas the band at 1690–1750
cm–1 becomes much stronger at 200 °C than those
on the other two catalysts, indicating that the presence of Ru maybe
change the reaction pathway. Combining a significant decrease in the
selectivity for VC caused by Ru species, it can be considered that
the formation of enolic species but aldehyde is related to VC. In
order to investigate the relation between VC and aldehyde or enolic
species, in situ FTIR analysis is conducted in VC oxidation. As shown
in Figure S14, there appear the bands at
1386, 1268, and 1605 cm–1, assigned to δCH2, ρCH, and γC=C of VC, respectively. The
bands at 1638 and 1400 cm–1 (C=C for C=C–O)
become strong with temperature. Obviously, Cl atom of VC can be abstracted
by strong acidic site, such as low coordination Al3+ site,
and the corresponding rest can be attacked nucleophilically by basic
oxygen species, such as hydroxyl group, surface oxygen, and lattice
oxygen, and converted into surface enolic species. The bands related
to aldehyde almost are not observed, confirming that aldehyde is not
resulted from VC oxidation. Indeed, in the presence of Ru species,
most ethoxy intermediate is oxidized into CO2 through the
formation of aldehyde, intermediate.

Figure 10 In situ FTIR spectra in 1100–4000
cm–1 region for Al2O3 (a),
Ce25Al75 (b), and Ru/Ce25Al75 (c) in a feed
of 1000 ppm 1,2-DCB, 20% O2 and Ar balance from 50 to 400
°C after the treatment in Ar at 550 °C.

On the basis of the above experimental results, it can be
postulated
that 1,2-DCE molecules interact with Lewis acid sites and surface
oxygen to form ClCH2–CHO intermediate. Over Ce10Al90 catalysts with poor reducibility, the rearrangement
of ClCH2–CHO results in the formation of VC, which,
in turn, interacts with a pair of acidic–basic sites to form
surface enolic species. During ethanol dehydration on Al2O3, an indispensable step was the rearrangement of CH3–CHO.49 At low temperature,
the availability of surface oxygen species is limited and the oxidation
of VC is difficult, whereas the chlorination of VC occurs easily under
the action of Ce species. At high temperature, more VC can be converted
into surface enolic species, which can be further oxidized. Ru increases
the reducibility of the catalysts, and thus the ethoxy intermediate
can be oxidized readily into aldehyde. As a result, the formation
of VC is retarded and chlorination cannot occur. A mechanism over
Ru/Ce10Al90 composed of six steps is schematized:
(1) the synergic interactions of Lewis acid sites and surface hydroxyl
groups with 1,2-DCE molecules to form ClCH2–CH2O intermediate; (2) the rearrangement of ClCH2–CH2O into aldehyde and benzene; (3) the adsorption and activation
of gas-phase oxygen on Ru or Ce species into surface active oxygen;
(4) surface-active oxygen’s attacking intermediate; (5) the
formation of oxygenate species; and (6) further reaction of oxygenate
species to form gas-phase reaction products (CO2, H2O, HCl, and Cl2).

3 Conclusions
A series of CexAly supports were synthesized using polyethyleneglycol (PEG 20000)
and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide as a template, on which 1.8 wt
% Ru was loaded by wet impregnation to obtain Ru/CexAly catalysts with various Ce/Ce
+ Al ratios. Characterization by XRD, Raman, NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD, XPS, and H2-TPR indicates that CeO2 exists as the form of face-centered cubic fluorite structure, whereas
the chemical state and structure of Ru species are depending on the
Ce/Ce + Al ratio. Ru4+ for Ru/CexAly catalysts increases with the
Ce/Ce + Al ratio. There is a strong interaction between Ru and Ce
species through the formation of Ru–O–Ce. The reduction
of Ru4+ or Ru6+ of Ru/CeO2 occurs
at lower temperature. At the same time, the reduction of Ce4+ is really promoted by Ru. Therefore, the reducibility of Ru/CexAly increases
with the Ce/Ce + Al ratio. A significant decrease in basicity can
be resulted from the incorporation of Ru, indicating that Ru species
anchors on the basic sites. Ru/CexAly catalysts present considerable activity
for 1,2-DCE decomposition. VC as a main product is observed over Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 at low temperature.
High activity for deep oxidation of Ru/CexAly can be resulted from a synergism
of acidity and reducibility. Ru greatly improves the activity for
deep oxidation and retards the chlorination through inhibiting the
formation of VC and decreasing Cl deposition on the surface. High
stability is observed at 280 °C within 25 h. In situ FTIR experiments
indicate that dissociative adsorption of 1,2-DCE results in the formation
of ClCH2–CH2O–, which is converted
into both aldehyde and VC through rearrangements on acid–base
sites. Aldehyde is intermediate species for deep oxidation, whereas
VC is responsible for enolic species.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Catalyst Preparation
CexAly mixed oxides with
various Ce/Ce + Al ratios were synthesized by the method as reference,50 where x + y = 100. CeO2 was synthesized by thermal decomposition
of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O at 550 °C
for 3 h in air. Ru was loaded on 2 g of CexAly with wet impregnation of ruthenium(III)
chloride (Ru 20 g mL–1) aqueous solution. The impregnated
solid was dried at 80 °C overnight and then heated in air to
450 °C which was maintained for 3 h. The Ru content of Ru/CexAly catalysts
is about 1.8 wt %.

4.2 Catalyst Characterization
The characterization
by XRD patterns, nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms, XPS,
Raman, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD was similar to the previously
reported work.7 TPD profiles of CO2 (CO2-TPD) were obtained on a Micromeritics 2920
apparatus equipped with a quadrupole mass (Q-MASS) detector.

4.3 Activity Measurements
Catalytic performance
of as-synthesized samples were evaluated in a fixed-bed microreactor
composed of a quartz tube (Φ = 3 mm). The grain catalyst (200
mg, 40–60 mesh) was placed in the fixed-bed. The feed was controlled
at 100 mL/min, and the corresponding GHSV = 30 000 h–1. For the standard test, the composition of reaction gas was 0.1%
1,2-DCE + 20% O2/N2. Reaction temperature was
controlled in a range of 150–500 °C. Using GC equipped
with FID, the organic chlorinated compounds at the outlet were analyzed
on-line. The activity and selectivity of catalysts were determined
in a range of 150–500 °C. The conversion was estimated
by the difference between outlet and inlet reactant concentrations
divided by the inlet reactant concentration. Cl2 was detected
by chemical titration of a 0.0125 N NaOH solution through which effluent
stream bubbles with ferrous ammonium sulfate using N,N-diethyl-p-phenylene-diamine
as an indicator.51

4.4 In Situ
FTIR
In situ diffuse reflectance
infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments were
conducted on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled
mercury-cadmium-telluride detector. The DRIFTS cell (Harrick, HVC-DRP)
fitted with ZnSe windows was used as the reaction chamber that allowed
samples to be heated to 650 °C. FTIR spectra for the synthesized
catalysts were recorded within a frequency range of 4000–1000
cm–1 at the resolution of 4 cm–1 and 64 scans. A given mass of catalyst was heated in Ar up to 550
°C to eliminate the contaminants and cooled down to 50 °C
in Ar. After being treated by the feed composed of 0.1% 1,2-DCE/Ar
or 0.1% 1,2-DCE + 20% O2/Ar at 50–400 °C and
followed by sweeping with Ar, the spectra of catalysts were recorded.
