Photocatalyst NaTaO3 with
a cube-shaped morphology and
an average particle size of 100 nm was synthesized using an effortless
hydrothermal method. The composite heterostructures of CdS/NaTaO3 with variable concentrations of CdS were fabricated after
the surface functionalization of bare NaTaO3 using 3-mercaptopropionic
acid. As-synthesized photocatalysts were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction
analysis, Raman spectroscopy, field-emission scanning and transmission
electron microscopies with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy furnished
with elemental mapping, multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET), and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Average
lifetime (τavg) of photoexcitons in heterostructures
was studied using photoluminescence (PL) empowered with the time-correlated
single-photon counting technique. The diminishing PL peak intensity
and reduced average lifetime (τavg) of photoexcitons
in heterostructures indicate the inhibition of photoexciton recombination
along with efficient photoexciton exchange between heterostructures.
As-synthesized heterostructures demonstrate enhanced visible-light
harvesting and appreciably increased the photocatalytic performance
toward the degradation of dye rhodamine B. This work highlights the
importance of heterostructures with new archetypes which may provide
a lead to develop highly capable and reusable photocatalysts to organic
dye degradation.

==== Body
Introduction
The dye pollutants
continue to be the major source of environmental
pollution; in particular, the effluents from the textile industries
contain approximately 15% nonfixed dyes.1 The conventional technologies are insufficient to reduce them down
to a nonhazardous level to protect the environment.2 Recently, the metal-oxide semiconductors (e.g., TiO2, NaNbO3, ZnO, and WO3) have attracted
wide attention because of their reasonable photo-oxidation of organic
pollutants under UV–vis irradiation.3−7 Among others, the perovskite-type metal oxides with
a simple perovskite unit ABO3 (A = Sr2+, Na+, Ba2+, Ca2+ and B = Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+) have garnered noticeable attention
to the degradation of organic dye pollutants;8,9 in
particular, tantalates exhibit a remarkable photocatalytic activity.10 Several tantalate nanomaterials have been employed
for the degradation of organic dye pollutants, for example, alkali
and alkaline earth tantalates KTaO3, NaTaO3,
LiTaO3 SrTa2O6, Ca2Ta2O7, and BaTa2O6.11−15 The promising photocatalytic performance of tantalates can be attributed
to two factors: (a) conduction band of Ta5d orbital situated
at a more negative potential as compared to others like Ti3d, Nb4d (pot. vs NHE) and (b) efficient photoexciton delocalization
produced by the proper orientation of TaO6 octahedra. These
factors are allied with the crystalline structure that is synthesis
route-dependent. With regard to the aforementioned, NaTaO3 is a prominent candidate with a distinctive perovskite-type structure
and some other useful properties including abundance, low environmental
impact, photochemical stability, and high crystallinity that directly
reduce the defects and recombination rate. Generally, NaTaO3 shows three very close synthetic route-dependent crystal structures—orthorhombic,
monoclinic, and cubic.16−20

As reported earlier, the monoclinic phase has the better response
to photocatalysis because of the following reasons: (a) Because of
indirect band gap, phonons are involved in the gap transition that
decreases the recombination rate of photoinduced excitons than that
in orthorhombic NaTaO3 which have a direct band gap. (b)
This phase has a larger number of effective high-density states close
to the band edges for the photoinduced excitons. (c) Monoclinic phase
of NaTaO3 is much closer to an ideal perovskite because
its Ta–O–Ta bond angle is near to 180° (i.e., cubic
phase) rather than a traditionally orthorhombic phase.21,22 However, owing to the large band gap of NaTaO3, most
of its photocatalytic applications are restricted to the UV-spectrum
range alone that makes it a poor photocatalyst for broad solar range
spectrum-based applications because of the fact that the solar spectrum
contains only 4–5% of UV light and visible light accounts nearly
to 45% of the solar spectrum.23−25 To utilize the NaTaO3 in the visible-light region, fabrication of heterojunction of NaTaO3 with other narrow band gap semiconductor materials has been
considered.26,27 Among other narrow band gap semiconductors,
CdS is a promising visible-light active and widely used photocatalyst
to combine with other wide band gap semiconductor oxides.6,7,28−30

Here,
we have synthesized two different phases (orthorhombic and
monoclinic) of NaTaO3, for structure comparison, using
two different methods (solid state and hydrothermal). Because of high
photoresponse shown by monoclinic NaTaO3,31 we have fabricated composite heterostructures with CdS
for monoclinic NaTaO3. 3-Mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) acts
as a surface-functionalizing reagent for bare NaTaO3 nanocubes,
which assured inherent combination with a uniform distribution of
CdS nanoparticles onto NaTaO3. These composite heterostructures
demonstrate enhanced photocatalytic performance compared to their
single corresponding counterpart in visible-light simulation. This
enhancement in photocatalytic performance could be associated with
the effective inhibition of photoexcited charge carrier recombination
and extensive absorption of light because of the fabrication of heterojunction.
The stability and reusability of the materials were further examined
and confirmed that photocatalyst heterostructures are reusable and
stable for real-world use in organic pollutant degradation. To our
knowledge, there are no reports on the photocatalytic performance
of CdS/NaTaO3 hetero archetypes, and this is the first
report on the synthesis, characterization, and investigation of CdS/NaTaO3. It is expected that this work may offer an upfront approach
for developing highly stable, effective, and recyclable hetero archetypes
for organic pollutant degradation.

Characterization
All of the photocatalysts synthesized in this study were assessed
in terms of phase composition, crystalline nature, and phase identification
by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray
diffractometer with a radiation source of Cu Kα (λ = 0.15418
nm), generated at 40 mA current and 40 kV voltage. The diffractometer
was equipped with a Ni-foil filter to produce monochromatic X-ray
by reducing the intensity of Kβ radiation. The data were collected
with a scanning speed of 0.02° s–1 in 10°–75°
2θ range. The room-temperature Raman spectra of the as-prepared
powder photocatalysts were recorded by using a Renishaw inVia Raman
spectrometric analyzer. The excitation source of the Ar+-ion laser was used with the 514.5 nm line and 2.5 mW laser power.
The recorded Raman spectrum exhibits a resolution of ∼0.5 cm–1. The morphology and composition of the materials
were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
(Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, with 10 kV accelerating voltage). The
microscopy was furnished with the detector of energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) for elemental mapping. Prior to scanning of specimens,
the samples were dispersed on carbon tape and sputter-coated with
a thin gold layer to avoid the charging effect on the sample. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM were used to determine detailed
morphology, gain insights, and study the surface of synthesized materials
by employing a transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 20) with 200 kV operating voltage. Samples for TEM/high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) were prepared after dispersing the sample powder in isopropyl
alcohol with the help of ultrasonication. Some drops of dispersion
were pipetted onto a holey carbon-coated copper grid of 400-mesh,
and then the grid was allowed to dry. Sample surface area and pore
size distribution were determined by a multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms
by employing a Quantachrome Autosorb-1C TCD analyzer with nitrogen
as an adsorptive gas. As per the imperative BET protocol, the samples
under vacuum were degassed at 80 °C for 10 h before studies.
The surface area and pore size distribution was estimated by BET equation
and Barret–Joyner–Halenda method at P/Po—0.99.32 A UV−vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (Shimadzu
UV-2450) was used to obtain the optical properties of samples over
the wavelength range 200–600 nm. The dried powder of BaSO4 was used as a 100% reflectance standard.33 The optical reflectance was converted by using the Kubelka–Munk
function (eq 1), where R is diffuse reflectance and F(R) is the Kubelka–Munk function. 1  

Further, the optical band gap of photocatalysts was calculated
using the following expression proposed by Tauc34,35 2  wherein A is a constant,
α is the absorption coefficient, h is the Planck
constant, ν is the frequency of vibration, Eg is the band gap of material, and n symbolizes
the type of the electronic transition. For indirect transition, n = 2, and direct transition, n = 1/2.
A plot with hν value on x-axis
and (α·hν)1/n on y-axis was drawn. Then, a linear extrapolation
of (α·hν)1/n to abscissa at zero provides an estimate of band gap energies.
At room temperature, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of the powder samples were collected using Horiba PTI
QuantaMaster 8450-11-C systems (Horiba Canada). The continuous wave
diode laser (with λex 250 nm) and pulsed nano light-emitting
diode (nano LED of 250 nm peak wavelengths with pulse duration <200
ps) were used for steady-state and time-resolved PL, respectively.

Results
and Discussion
PXRD and Raman Analysis (for Monoclinic and
Orthorhombic Phases)
To know the crystallinity, purity, and
phase composition of photocatalysts,
PXRD analysis was performed. After the qualitative scrutiny of both
patterns (monoclinic and orthorhombic) Figure S1a, it was found that there was no peak for any precursor
(Ta2O5, NaOH, and Na2CO3). The diffraction patterns of NaTaO3 (hyd.) and NaTaO3 (S.S.) were closely associated with the documented monoclinic
(ICDD 01-74-2479) and orthorhombic (ICDD 01-73-0878) phase of NaTaO3, respectively. Further, a detailed phase confirmation was
succeeded by a quantitative analysis of some principle peaks at 2θ
position of ∼40, 58, and 68 as shown in Figure S1a (inset). The NaTaO3 (hyd.) diffraction
peaks do not show any split like conventional orthorhombic NaTaO3 (S.S.). Monoclinic phase observed in the PXRD pattern might
be a result of a specific hydrothermal temperature and alkali concentration
(10 N) because the crystalline structure of NaTaO3 is synthetic
route-sensitive.36,37

Raman spectroscopy was
employed as an additional study to justify the difference between
the monoclinic and orthorhombic phase of NaTaO3 (hyd.)
and NaTaO3 (S.S.), respectively; graphs are shown in Figure S1b. Both the graphs were almost same,
showing perovskite-like structures. However, after a deep scrutiny
of the NaTaO3 (hyd.) spectrum, some extra bands were found
near 572 and 862 cm–1 which were in accordance with
previously reported work for the monoclinic structure of NaTaO3.38 The deconvolution fitting for
the 572 cm–1 band is demonstrated in the inset of Figure S1b, and the band at ∼862 is encircled.
Some extra distinguishable bands (encircled) were also observed in
spectra of NaTaO3 (S.S.), indicating an orthorhombic structure
of NaTaO3.38 This finding from
Raman spectroscopy analysis supports the above-discussed PXRD verdict
that NaTaO3 (hyd.) and NaTaO3 (S.S.) have monoclinic
and orthorhombic phases, respectively.

PXRD and Raman Analysis
of NaTaO3 (hyd.), CdS, and
Cd/Ta
The PXRD patterns of NaTaO3 (hyd.), CdS,
and all composites of the Cd/Ta heterostructure are shown in Figure 1a. Patterns of NaTaO3 (hyd.) and CdS show the close resemblance to the documented
monoclinic (ICDD 01-74-2479) and cubic phase (ICDD 01-075-1546), respectively.
Patterns of different millimolar ratio composites of Cd/Ta (1:1, 2:1,
4:1, 6:1, 8:1, and 10:1) heterostructures exhibit additional peaks
of CdS at 2θ ≈ 26.5 and 44° with a monoclinic diffraction
pattern for NaTaO3. These additional peaks of CdS, assuredly
indexed to the crystallographic planes (111) and (220) of cubic phase
CdS. The intensity of CdS peaks remarkably enhanced with the increasing
molar ratio of CdS in Cd/Ta heterostructures.

Figure 1 (a) PXRD patterns of
NaTaO3 (hyd.), CdS, and all composite
heterostructures of Cd/Ta. (b) Raman spectrum of NaTaO3 (hyd.), CdS, and 8 Cd/Ta.

The PXRD investigations revealed the existence of both phases
(cubic
CdS and monoclinic NaTaO3) in all of the Cd/Ta heterostructures
and the possible fabrication of composites of CdS and NaTaO3. Subsequently, Raman studies were carried out for NaTaO3, CdS, and composite 8 Cd/Ta heterostructures; the spectra are shown
in Figure 1b. Interestingly,
with subsequent growth of CdS nanoparticles onto NaTaO3 nanocubes, the heterostructures show the Raman bands of both CdS
and NaTaO3. In the composite’s spectrum, a band
near 303 cm–1 that originated from the CdS stretching
mode revealed the presence of CdS, and the band at 621 cm–1 was remarkably broadened because of the overlapping of Raman bands
of NaTaO3 with CdS. Additionally, the Raman bands of the
composite showed a blue shift toward higher wavenumber, indicating
the lattice contraction of the NaTaO3 (hyd.) nanocubes.
Thus, the results obtained by Raman spectroscopy studies show the
presence of composite heterostructures and support PXRD results. However,
the confirmation of composites fabrication was substantiated by additional
results.

FESEM Analysis
The morphology of bare NaTaO3, CdS, and composite 8 Cd/Ta was determined by the FESEM. NaTaO3 has a uniform cube-shaped morphology without secondary nanoparticles.
The average size of the nanocubes is of 100 nm with smooth surfaces,
as displayed in Figure 2a. CdS showed uniform spherical nanoparticles of 10 nm average size,
as shown in Figure 2b. After growing the CdS nanoparticles on NaTaO3 nanocubes,
the morphology of NaTaO3 nanocubes was still preserved
as shown in Figure 2c. However, compared to bare NaTaO3 nanocubes, the 8 Cd/Ta
heterostructures exhibit a larger cube size with the rough surface,
showing the successful decoration of CdS nanoparticles on NaTaO3 nanocubes.

Figure 2 FESEM images of (a) NaTaO3 (hyd.) nanocubes,
(b) CdS
nanoparticles, and (c) composite 8 Cd/Ta heterostructures.

Thus, the outcomes acquired from FESEM images display
the existence
of NaTaO3 nanocubes, CdS nanoparticles, and composite 8
Cd/Ta heterostructures which support the PXRD and Raman results.

EDS with Elemental Mapping Studies
To study the elemental
composition and distribution in 8 Cd/Ta heterostructures, EDS analysis
furnished with elemental mapping was performed. The EDS spectrum of
the selected cube area of the FESEM image is shown in Figure 3a, displaying very sharp peaks
for the entire constituent elements in Figure 3b. The mapping results (Figure 3c–g) of the selected
cube FESEM image clearly show the coexistence of elements Cd, S, Ta,
Na, and O in 8 Cd/Ta heterostructures. Distribution of elements is
homogeneously uniform, endorsing that NaTaO3 nanocubes
are uniformly wrapped by very tiny particles of CdS. FESEM results
support the PXRD and Raman data with indication of heterostructure
formation.

mapping of (c) Na, (d) Ta, (e) O, (f) Cd, and (g) S, in composite
heterostructures.

TEM/HRTEM Analysis
TEM analysis of NaTaO3 (hyd.) and 8 Cd/Ta further revealed
the cube shape of particles
with fine deposition of CdS on NaTaO3; images are shown
in Figure 4a,b. HRTEM
shown in Figure 4c
revealed the interface between the CdS and NaTaO3. The
calculated atomic spacing for NaTaO3 (0.38 nm) corresponds
to the (100) plane of monoclinic phase, and for CdS, (0.33 nm) corresponds
to the (111) plane of cubic phase. A further convincing proof of composite
8 Cd/Ta heterostructure formations was assured by the HRTEM studies.
Therefore, TEM/HRTEM analysis clearly reveals the cube morphology
with the monoclinic phase of NaTaO3 (hyd.) and the existence
of composite Cd/Ta heterostructures that support the PXRD, Raman spectroscopy,
and FESEM results.

BET Surface Area Studies
Higher surface area leads
to more adsorption of dye on the photocatalyst and improves transportation
of charge carriers that results in enhancement of the degradation
rate of organic dye pollutants.39 Therefore,
surface area and pore size studies of photocatalysts are two of the
important criteria. To estimate the surface area of powder photocatalysts,
nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded, and
results are displayed in Figure S2. It
is noteworthy that the bare NaTaO3 (hyd.) showed BET isotherm
type-2 which depicted nonporous type of samples. However, the composite
8 Cd/Ta showed an alteration in isotherm toward the isotherm type
4 and exhibits the mesoporous nature of the material. Further, the
pore size distribution in 8 Cd/Ta also indicated the occurrence of
increasing pores in comparison to NaTaO3 (hyd.). The details
of surface area, pore volume, and pore radius are compiled in Table 1. The obtained pores
were accountable to increasing surface area and pore volume of 8 Cd/Ta.
It is pertinent to note that after loading CdS nanoparticles on bare
NaTaO3 (hyd.) nanocubes, the surface area with pore volume
of resulting heterostructures greatly enhanced.

UV–Vis DRS Studies
The optical
properties of
the powder samples were studied using UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy. Obtained data of NaTaO3 (hyd.), CdS, and
all composite of Cd/Ta heterostructures are shown in Figure 5. As expected, NaTaO3 nanocubes and CdS nanoparticles show an obvious absorption at 253
nm in the UV region and at 440 nm in the visible region, respectively.
This absorption may be ascribed to the electron excitation from the
valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB).40 Integration of CdS nanoparticles with NaTaO3 nanocubes
resulted in a noticeable red shift of absorption onset of NaTaO3. This red shift may be credited to the interfacial interaction
between NaTaO3 nanocubes and CdS nanoparticles.41 This transformation was effortlessly distinguishable
from the color of NaTaO3-white to 8 Cd/Ta-yellow as presented
in the Figure 5 inset.

data of NaTaO3, CdS, and all Cd/Ta heterostructures;
inset shows the snapshots of NaTaO3 and 8 Cd/Ta heterostructures

The accurate estimation of semiconductor
photocatalyst band gap
is significantly important for the photocatalytic activity. The band
gap can be estimated from the Tauc plot, (α·hν)2 on y-axis versus the photon
energy (hν (eV)) on x-axis.
A linear extrapolation of (α·hν)2 to abscissa at zero provides an estimation of band gap. The
monoclinic NaTaO3 is reported to be an indirect band gap
semiconductor. It means that the optical transitions of NaTaO3 are not directly allowed,37 and
the value of n is 2 for the Tauc equation, whereas
the n value for directly allowed transitions of CdS
is 1/2.42 Band gaps of NaTaO3 and CdS using Tauc plots were estimated to be 4 and 2.48 eV, respectively,
as shown in Figure 6a. Assuming the composite heterostructures to be direct band gap
semiconductors, band gap energies from 2.9 to 2.59 eV were estimated
for composites Cd/Ta heterostructures, as shown in Figure 6b, and the detailed values
are tabulated in Table 3. From the DRS results, it is evident that
the band gap energy of all Cd/Ta composite heterostructures lies in
the visible region, and it decreases linearly as the millimolar ratio
of CdS is increased in Cd/Ta composites. Consequently, these heterostructures
were expected to perform the visible-light-driven photocatalytic activities.

and indirect band gaps of CdS and NaTaO3 respectively
and (b) band gaps of all Cd/Ta composite heterostructures and CdS.

PL Studies
To
appraise the performance of heterostructure
photocatalysts, the charge-transfer rate of photoexcitons between
heterointerfaces is one of the important factors and can be experimentally
studied using steady-state PL and time-resolved PL.28,43 To do so, we have performed both the characterization. Steady-state
PL emission intensity for all of the Cd/Ta composite heterostructures
was appreciably reduced in comparison to their counterparts, that
is, CdS and NaTaO3 shown in Figure 7a. Noticeably, the intensity of the only
last member of the composite series (i.e., 10 Cd/Ta) was further increased
because of the exceeding amount of CdS in composite leads toward the
increasing radiative recombination.

Figure 7 (a) PL spectrum of CdS, NaTaO3, and all Cd/Ta composite
heterostructures. (b) TRPL decay profiles of NaTaO3, CdS,
and all Cd/Ta composite heterostructures.

Figure 7b
represents
the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay profiles of CdS,
NaTaO3, and all Cd/Ta composite heterostructures that were
recorded at 488 nm with λex 250 nm. In the view of
quantitative evaluation, decay profiles were fitted with an exponential
function using eq 3,
and the average photoexcitons lifetimes were calculated using eq 4.44 3   4  Herein, I(t) is the intensity at the time t, n is the number of emissive species, τi is the excited state lifetime, and Ai is the excited-state intensity
associated
with ith component. The τavg is the average lifetime of photoexcitons. All of the decay profiles
were satisfactorily fitted using a biexponential decay function, and
the derived parameter values are tabulated in Table 2. In the broad spectrum, the obtained average
photoexciton lifetime depends on (i) radiative lifetime (τr) and (ii) nonradiative lifetime (τnr), which
can be articulated as 5  

Table 2 Summary of TRPL Profiles Fitting Parameters
and Average Lifetime of Photocatalysts, Calculated Using eqs 4 and 5
sample	A1	τ1 (ns)	A2	τ2 (ns)	τavg (ns)	
CdS	250	0.9	260	3.5	2.99	
NaTaO3	280	0.39	175	2.9	2.45	
Cd/Ta	250	0.35	165	2.85	2.44	
2 Cd/Ta	220	0.38	130	2.8	2.34	
4 Cd/Ta	200	0.29	110	2.65	2.25	
6 Cd/Ta	185	0.16	52	2.3	1.87	
8 Cd/Ta	180	0.15	30	0.9	0.52	
10 Cd/Ta	220	0.86	250	3.45	2.98	
Because the τavg of CdS is relatively
longer than
the obtained τavg for heterostructures, τavg was shortened because of the nonradiative decay (1/τnr), which can be credited to charge carrier transfer events
to the neighboring heterointerface. This argument may also justify
with steady-state PL spectra displayed in Figure 7a; here, the Cd/Ta PL emission intensity
is lower than that of CdS and NaTaO3.43,44 The physical origin of the nonradiative heterostructures transition
may be credited to adjustment of CB and VB of CdS and NaTaO3 portrayed in Figure 10.

The average photoexciton lifetime of Cd/Ta, 2 Cd/Ta, 4 Cd/Ta,
6
Cd/Ta, and 8 Cd/Ta heterostructures was shorter than the average lifetime
of their counterparts, that is, CdS and NaTaO3. Nonetheless,
the average photoexciton lifetime of 10 Cd/Ta heterostructures was
close to the average lifetime of CdS because of exceeding amount of
CdS. Among all composite heterostructures, 8 Cd/Ta showed the shortest
average lifetime which gave a clear indication of nonradiative photoexciton
transfer between heterostructures that occurred because of the fabrication
of the heterostructure junction between CdS nanoparticles and NaTaO3 nanocubes. Outcomes of TRPL were consistent with steady-state
PL graph displayed in Figure 7a, where CdS luminescence intensity was higher as compared
to NaTaO3 and all Cd/Ta composite heterostructures, showing
the higher possibility of photoexciton recombination in CdS nanoparticles.
Therefore, the photoexcitons could be effectively separated at the
heterostructures. Subsequently, the photoexcitons could travel more
efficiently to the surface of NaTaO3 and CdS nanoarchitectures.
These photoexcitons have high potential for organic dye degradation.
The abovementioned results clearly show the charge carrier injection
between heterostructures which produced the remarkable reduction of
photoexciton recombination.

Photocatalytic Activity
Organic
dyes are widespread
commercial materials that can cause noxious environmental pollution.45,46 The main discharge of organic dyes to the environment takes place
via dye wastes of textile industries. Organic dyes may go to anaerobic
degradation which may result in cancer-causing amines.47 Organic dye-based industrial waste treatment
is the most challenging work to protect the environment from dye pollution.
General methods concerning biological or physical remedies do not
attain considerable accomplishment.48,49 Nonetheless,
semiconductor photocatalysts are advanced alternative materials that
can successfully degrade dye pollutants by photocatalysis. Therefore,
to determine the photocatalytic efficiency of as-synthesized NaTaO3 (hyd.), CdS, and all of the Cd/Ta composite heterostructure
photocatalysts, rhodamine B dye was employed as a specific pollutant
of industrial wastewater. Before illumination, dye-photocatalyst dispersions
were kept in dark for 40 min to assure the equilibrium of dye-photocatalyst
adsorption–desorption. After every 10 min interval, the absorption
representative peak (∼554 nm) of dye was trailed to screen
the photocatalytic degradation of dye. It was observed that the height
of representative absorption peak reduced with time and almost disappeared
after 110 min. The decreased absorbance intensity of rhodamine B was
because of the dye chromogen.50 The temporal
progress of the spectral changes throughout the degradation of dye
with most active 8 Cd/Ta photocatalyst is a function of visible-light
irradiation time, as portrayed in Figure 8a. Furthermore, Figure 8a displays the significant absorption peak
step-by-step blue shift of about 55 nm without any new absorption
arose during the experiment, which may be credited to N-de-ethylation of rhodamine B.51−53 A proposed mechanism for N-de-ethylation and almost complete dye degradation is established
in the Scheme 1.

Figure 8 (a) Rhodamine
B degradation by 8 Cd/Ta. (b) Rhodamine B degradation
(C/Co vs irradiation
time) with different photocatalysts in visible-light irradiation.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for N-de-ethylation and Complete
Degradation of Dye
The photodegradation efficiency curves (C/Co vs time) of all of the as-synthesized
photocatalysts
are disclosed in Figure 8b and unveiled that the photocatalytic efficiency of dye degradation
by using composite heterostructures was much higher than their counterparts
[NaTaO3 (hyd.) and CdS]. Consequently, it was observed
that heterostructure efficiency increased with the increasing CdS
molar ratio from 1 to 8 in Cd/Ta, but after 8 Cd/Ta, it was reduced
because an exceeding amount of CdS leads to increase of recombination
of photoexcitons. This recombination of photoexcitons could be understood
from steady-state and time-resolved PL, as presented in Figure 7a,b, respectively. The photocatalytic
performance of 8 Cd/Ta heterostructures to degrade rhodamine B evidenced
from the color difference of rhodamine B dye aqueous solution is portrayed
in the inset of Figure 8b.

The degradation efficiency comparison of most active 8 Cd/Ta
and
its individual counterparts (NaTaO3 and CdS) in a visible-light
simulation is shown in Figure 9b. This figure clearly indicates that almost 97.2% of rhodamine
B was degraded after 110 min by using the composite of 8 Cd/Ta, whereas
only 1.2 and 57.2% of the rhodamine B was degraded when NaTaO3 nanocubes and CdS nanoparticles were used, respectively.
The summary of degradation efficiency for all of the as-synthesized
photocatalysts is tabulated in Table 3.

To make a useful assessment, the degradation
kinetics of NaTaO3, CdS, and all of the Cd/Ta composites
were fitted in a pseudo-first-order
model as expressed by eq 6, extensively used for photocatalysis dye degradation as the primary
concentration of the dye is low.54 6  where k is the pseudo-first-order
dye degradation constant and Co and C are the concentrations of rhodamine B before and after
irradiation time t, respectively. Graphs of rhodamine
B logarithmic concentration versus the irradiation time for all of
the photocatalysts were almost linear, showing the overall photocatalytic
kinetic of rhodamine B degradation consonance with the first-order
reaction. The photodegradation rate constant calculated from the slope
of rhodamine B for various photocatalysts is displayed in Figure 9a. The eventual authentication
of our results is that 8 Cd/Ta heterostructures are found to be a
highly efficient photocatalyst. The apparent degradation constants
estimated from the slope were used to correlate the photodegradation
performance of all of the samples, and data are tabulated in Table 3. The most apparent
degradation constant of 8 Cd/Ta heterostructures was 3.27 × 10–1 min–1, that was appreciably enhanced
as compared to other Cd/Ta composites and pure NaTaO3 and
CdS.

It is essential to elucidate the fundamental roots of efficiently
enhanced photocatalytic performance of Cd/Ta composite heterostructures,
which can be credited to the following factors.

High Crystallinity
Multiple factors can contribute
for the origin of remarkable enhanced photocatalytic efficiency on
composite heterostructures. First of all, it can be a credit to the
crystallinity of as-synthesized photocatalysts. Without any high-temperature
calcination or annealing, photocatalysts synthesized in this work
were highly crystalline as seen in PXRD patterns.

Expanded Visible-Light
Absorption
Visible-light photoactivity
of composites may mainly be due to the extended absorption in the
visible-light range. As reflected in optical analysis (Figures 6 and 7), the deposition of CdS nanoparticles onto NaTaO3 nanocubes
resulted in an extended photoresponse. In addition, a noticeable reduction
of band gap energy 4 eV to 2.59 eV gave an extraordinary potential
for visible-light harvesting, which results in higher photocatalytic
performance of the composite heterostructure.

High Surface Area
The surface area for photocatalyst
materials is one of the crucial efficiency deciding factors. The higher
surface area of composite heterostructures accounts for remarkable
dye adsorption. The higher surface area also offers higher diffusion
and transportation of rhodamine B resulting in considerable enhancement
of the photocatalytic performance of composites in the comparison
to its counterparts (NaTaO3 and CdS).

Efficient
Photogenerated Charge Carrier Separation
It is also one of
the most central factors, contributing to remarkably
enhanced photocatalytic activity of composites by the facile transportation
and separation of photoexcitons after fabrication of heterojunctions
between different band gap semiconductors. Band-banding with ECB and EVB potentials
for CdS and NaTaO3 is shown in Figure 10. Although it is not very easy to estimate the band edge positions
experimentally, a simple theoretical estimation was feasible by using
the following expressions.55 7   8  where EVB is the
valence band potential, ECB is the conduction
band potential, Eg is the band gap energy
of photocatalyst semiconductor, E° is the scale factor (E° = −4.5
eV for NHE), and χ is geometric mean of absolute electronegativity
of the constituent atoms. It is in general that for more positive
valence band potential, holes have more oxidative efficiency and for
more negative potential of the conduction band, electrons have more
reductive efficiency. According to expressions 7 and 8, the estimated potentials of ECB and EVB of pure
NaTaO3 (hyd.), CdS, and 8 Cd/Ta are tabulated in Table 4.

band alignment and specific charge transfer

From
this band alignment scheme of the composite heterostructure,
it was determined that when the Cd/Ta photocatalyst is dispersed in
rhodamine B aqueous solution and irradiated under visible-light simulation,
rhodamine dye and CdS work as sensitizers. These sensitizers absorb
visible light and get excited. Excited-dye molecule transfer charge
to CB of CdS which further generates active oxygen species (•O2–) that eventually attack on radical
cation dye (Rh-B•+, generated after charge transfer)
results in N-de-ethylation.51,56−59

Concurrently, photoexcited CdS transfer charge from the ECB of CdS to ECB of NaTaO3 possessed by lowered potential energy and contrariwise
holes transfer from EVB of NaTaO3 to the EVB of CdS. Consequently, photoexcitons
were parted at the Cd/Ta heterointerfaces, which results in the reduction
of their recombination possibility and sanctioned them effectively
to reach the surfaces of NaTaO3 and CdS.60 These photoexcitons (e– and h+) instantly perform reduction–oxidation and generate the active
radical species (•O2–/OH•); these species further degrade rhodamine
B.61,62 A query might be raised regarding the efficiency
of dye sensitization. It can be resolved by comparing the degradation
kinetics. In the presence of CdS only, it was 9.48 × 10–3 min–1, which is quite low as compared to the heterojunction
8 Cd/Ta-3.27 × 10–1 min–1. This comparison shows that light absorption by CdS plays the dominant
role. After considerations of the above statements, we have proposed
a plausible dye degradation mechanism for rhodamine B over Cd/Ta composite
heterostructures, as shown in Scheme 1.

Thus, the fabrication of heterojunctions speeds
up electron–hole
separation and inhibits the rate of recombination, which promotes
the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the above factors
including high surface area, expanded visible-light absorption, high
crystallinity, and formation of heterostructures are collectively
accountable for the extraordinarily enhanced photocatalytic performance
of 8 Cd/Ta composite heterostructures.

Stability and Recyclability
To check recyclability
of the photocatalyst, the used photocatalyst after washing was further
used to degrade rhodamine B. This experiment was repeated for two
more successive cycles to check the performance. As demonstrated in Figure S3a, the 8 Cd/Ta composite heterostructures
exhibit no major loss in the photocatalytic performance. The dye degradation
efficiencies of the composite heterostructures for subsequent cycles
of first, second, and third were found to be 97.2, 95.1, and 93.2%
respectively. The photostability of 8 Cd/Ta composite heterostructures
was also examined using the PXRD analysis. Figure S3b shows that no foremost alteration was found after three
consecutive photodegradation cycles as compared to unused pattern.
An important feature of 8 Cd/Ta photocatalysts was durability; contrarily,
CdS easily gets photocorroded and/or oxidized, which results in low
activity and stability.58 Thus, all these
recyclability experiments of 8 Cd/Ta composite heterostructures explicitly
support a foundation that the heterostructures can be used as a practically
feasible and stable photocatalytic material. Hence, this work is an
effort to develop capable alternatives for environment protection.

Conclusions
NaTaO3 nanocubes have been fruitfully
synthesized through
the hydrothermal method. Composite Cd/Ta heterostructure photocatalysts
with highly dispersed CdS nanoparticles on NaTaO3 were
fabricated through a wet chemical route. These heterostructure photocatalysts
showed the efficiently enhanced photocatalytic performance toward
degradation of rhodamine B aqueous solution underneath visible-light
simulation as compared to their individual counterparts. The composite
of 8 Cd/Ta displayed best photocatalytic efficiency which degrades
nearly 97.2% of rhodamine B after irradiation of 110 min. Relatively
small CdS nanoparticles (than separately synthesized) dispersed uniformly
on the surface of NaTaO3, which facilitates the maximum
contact between CdS nanoparticles and NaTaO3 nanocubes.
This maximum heterointerface contact effectively endorses the interfacial
charge injection and reduces the rate of recombination of photoinduced
charge carriers. Because of this, effective interfacial charge-transfer
accumulation of photoexcitons was prevented in CB and VB of CdS which
ultimately inhibit the corrosion of CdS that further results in the
enhancement of the stability of the photocatalyst. The visible-light
harvesting through wide band gap semiconductors was achieved by constructing
the heterostructures of semiconductors with the well-defined crystal
structure. This work offers a facile way to architect heterointerface
composites for efficient photocatalytic dye degradation.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of NaTaO3 Nanocubes
NaTaO3 nanocubes used for composite fabrication were synthesized
by the modified hydrothermal route63 using
analytical grade Ta2O5 (Alfa Aesar 99%, metal
basis) and NaOH (Alfa Aesar 98%) as the starting materials. In this
facile synthesis, first, Ta2O5 (1 g) was dispersed
in double-distilled (DD) water using magnetic stirring for 30 min,
and then, the dispersion was mixed with NaOH (10 N) solution. The
subsequent reaction suspension was transferred in a 50 mL Teflon cup
which was sealed in a stainless-steel autoclave. The sealed autoclave
was heated at 165 °C for 48 h in an oven to build autogenous
pressure in the autoclave. After completion of 48 h, the autoclave
was being air cooled down, and the obtained precipitate was simply
collected by centrifugal separation at 6000 rpm. This precipitate
was washed several times with DD water and then by absolute ethanol
thoroughly to remove excess amount of NaOH. Finally, the obtained
product was dried in an oven at 80 °C and named as NaTaO3 (hyd.).

Synthesis of Bulk NaTaO3
Bulk NaTaO3 with the conventional orthorhombic structure
was prepared
by a solid-state procedure for structural comparison.31 Na2CO3 (99.5% Alfa Aesar) and Ta2O5 (99%, Alfa Aesar, metal basis) were employed
as precursors. Dried starting precursors were taken according to the
stoichiometry along with 5% excess of Na2CO3 to recompense the volatilization loss of Na. Both materials were
mixed by an agate mortar pestle with the help of acetone. The mixture
was calcined at 1200 degree centigrade for 10 h in an alumina crucible
using a programmed furnace with controlled heating and cooling @ 3
°C/minute. Calcination was conducted repeatedly with intermediary
grindings three times to remove carbonate and other impurities completely.
Finally, the resultant product was named as NaTaO3 (S.S.)

Synthesis of CdS Nanoparticles
For comparative photocatalytic
studies, CdS nanoparticles were separately synthesized using the hydrothermal
method. Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (≥98.0%
Sigma-Aldrich) and NH2CSNH2 (≥98.0% Sigma-Aldrich)
were used as precursors.64 Both analytical
grade precursors were used without any further purification. Preparation
was started by dissolving both the precursors separately in ethylene
glycol and then mixing them together by using magnetic stirring. The
obtained reaction mixture was then transferred into a 50 mL Teflon
cup and sealed in a stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave was kept
in an oven and heated at 180 °C for 2 h and subsequently air
cooled naturally. The obtained yellow precipitate was collected after
centrifugation at 6000 rpm. The precipitate was washed many times
with DD H2O and absolute C2H5OH thoroughly.
Then, the obtained yellow product was placed in an oven for drying
at 80 °C.

Fabrication of CdS/NaTaO3 Composite
Heterostructures
To wrap the NaTaO3 nanocubes
with CdS nanoparticles,
NaTaO3 nanocubes were surface-functionalized by 3-MPA.65,66 To do this, as-synthesized NaTaO3 (hyd.) nanocubes were
dispersed in DD H2O, and then, 20 μL of 3-MPA was
added. The almost complete surface functionalization of nanocubes
was achieved by continuous magnetic stirring for 2 h. Then, solution
of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O was added slowly
dropwise to the reaction mixture under continuous room-temperature
stirring. To study the consequence of the CdS amount in composites,
different molar fractions of Cd/Ta (1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 6:1, 8:1, and 10:1
in millimoles) were taken. Finally, the required amount of sodium
sulfide nonahydrate solution was added drop-by-drop to the above reaction
mixture under continuous stirring. The resulting reaction mixture
was gradually turned to pale yellow, demonstrating the synthesis of
CdS nanoparticles. The obtained yellow products were extracted by
using centrifuge and washed repeatedly with DD H2O and
absolute C2H5OH. Washed products were kept for
drying in an oven at 80 °C. Details of all synthesized composites
(CdS wrapped NaTaO3 nanocubes) are given in Table 5.

Photocatalytic Experiment
The photocatalytic experiment
was carried out using 50 mg of the photocatalyst dispersed in 100
mL of solution of rhodamine B (1 μM). Before simulating in visible
light, first, the dispersion was placed in dark and magnetically stirred
at 400 rpm for 40 min to get the equilibrium of adsorption–desorption
between the photocatalyst and aqueous organic dye solution. Subsequently,
the dye-photocatalyst dispersion kept on a magnetic stirrer under
a xenon arc lamp (300 W) equipped with a running water cooling system
to keep stable temperature. In the course of the experiment, after
every successive 10 min, an adequate aliquot (2.5 mL) of the dispersion
was pipetted-out and centrifuged at 6000 rpm to remove out the photocatalyst
from dye solution. The photodegradation efficiency of the photocatalyst
was censored by collecting the UV–vis spectra of the centrifuged
aliquot to monitor the change in nature of the characteristic peak
of rhodamine B at ∼554 nm. The spectrometer of Shimadzu (UV-2450)
was used in this experiment. The photodegradation efficiency (D %) of photocatalysts was computed using the following eq 9.67 9  where Co is the
concentration of dye after the adsorption–desorption equilibrium
without irradiation and C is the concentration of
rhodamine B at different time intervals. Further, after completion
of dye degradation, the stability and recyclability of the photocatalyst
were examined by running other degradation cycles. Prior to the second
run, the photocatalyst was washed thoroughly with DD H2O and absolute C2H5OH and then dried at 80
°C.
