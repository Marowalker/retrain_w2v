Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a naturally
occurring polyphenol in the
human diet and plants, exhibiting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
activities. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of
CGA on intestinal development and health in weaned pigs. Twenty-four
weaned pigs were randomly assigned to two treatments and fed with
a basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with 1000 mg/kg CGA. After
a 14 d trial, samples were collected. Compared with the control group,
CGA supplementation decreased the serum tumor necrosis factor-α,
interleukin-6, and interleukin-1βIL-6 concentrations and elevated
the serum immunoglobulin G and jejunal secretory immunoglobulin A
concentrations. Meanwhile, jejunal villus height, duodenal and jejunal
villus width, and jejunal and ileal villus height/crypt depth were
increased by CGA. CGA not only decreased the number of duodenal and
jejunal cells in the G0G1 phase but also increased the number of jejunal
and ileal cells in the S phase. The percentages of late and total
apoptotic cells in jejunum and the ratio of B-cell lymphoma-2-assiciated
X protein to B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in duodenum and jejunum were
also decreased by CGA supplementation. Finally, CGA upregulated the
expression level of Bcl-2 in duodenum and jejunum, whereas it downregulated
the expression levels of caspase-3 in duodenum and jejunum, caspase-9
in jejunum, as well as Fas in jejunum and ileum. This study suggested
that the beneficial effects of CGA on intestinal development and health
are partially due to improvement in immune defense and suppression
in excessive apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells in weaned pigs.

==== Body
Introduction
Weaning is an unavoidable stressful event,
exposing young infants
to multiple stressful factors and often resulting in tremendous changes
in gastrointestinal physiology and immunology,1,2 because
the intestine of young infants is still not completely mature.1 Previous evidence in infants indicates that weaning
results in physiological inflammation of the gut and subsequently
causes the epithelial crypt hyperplasia.1 Furthermore, a recent study showed that weaning could also damage
the intestine by contributing to oxidative stress and eventually led
to enterocyte apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the small intestine
of weaned pigs.3 It is well-known that
the intestine plays important roles in the digestion and absorption
of nutrients, and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue is the largest
immune organ in the body.4 Therefore, how
to alleviate the negative effects of weaning stressors has become
an urgent problem for the healthy development of animals. Nowadays,
there is increasing interest in ameliorating the damage of animals
or poultry induced by stress through dietary supplementation with
certain plant polyphenols.5−7

Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is
one of the most abundant dietary polyphenols
formed by esterification of caffeic acid and quinic acid, which is
the major active ingredient found in various fruits and vegetables
such as pear, apple, and potatoes8 and
other daily drinks including coffee and tea.9 Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that CGA possesses numerous
health-promoting properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial,
and antiinflammatory effects.10−12 In addition, studies have shown
that CGA efficiently inhibited the apoptosis induced by acetaminophen
and methylmercury in vivo and in vitro models,11,12 respectively. Earlier work by Ruan et al. (2014)13 showed that CGA has been used as a feed supplement to protect
the intestinal morphology in LPS-challenged weaned rats. Therefore,
it has received considerable attention as a functional ingredient
to attenuate the stress-induced damages in animals and human beings.14−16 However, until now, there is extremely limited information about
the effects of CGA supplementation on intestinal development and health
in weaned pigs. It is well-known that intestinal inflammation and
unbalanced enterocyte cellular processes in the weaning period are
tightly linked to intestinal injury.1,17 Therefore,
we speculated that CGA can enhance the intestinal development and
health of weaned pigs by improving the immune function and suppressing
the enterocyte apoptosis. This study was conducted to verify this
hypothesis.

Results
Serum Immunoglobulin and Cytokines
Compared with the
CON group, the serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration was increased
(P < 0.05), whereas the serum tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)
concentrations were decreased (P < 0.05) in pigs
fed with the CGA-supplemented diet (Table 1). However, no significant difference in
serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) was observed
between pigs on the CGA group and the CON group.

Intestinal Morphology
The small intestinal morphology
of weaned pigs was presented in Table 3 and Figure 1. In the duodenum, dietary CGA supplementation did not affect
the villus height and crypt depth but increased (P < 0.05) the villus width and tended (P <
0.10) to increase the villous height/crypt depth ratio (VCR). In the
jejunum, pigs in the CGA group had higher (P <
0.05) villus height, villus width, and VCR than those in the CON group.
In the ileum, the VCR was increased (P < 0.05)
by CGA supplementation. However, no significant effect of dietary
CGA supplementation was detected on villus height, villus width, and
crypt depth.

Apoptotic Percentage
The percentages of apoptotic cells
in the duodenum of weaned pigs were not significantly affected by
dietary treatment (Figures 2 and 3). Compared with the CON group,
CGA decreased (P < 0.05) the percentages of late
apoptotic cells and total apoptotic cells in the jejunum. Furthermore,
pigs on the CGA group had an increased (P < 0.05)
viable cells percentage and tended (P < 0.10)
to have a decreased ileal late apoptotic percentage than those on
the CON group. However, no significant effects of dietary CGA supplementation
were observed on the early apoptotic percentage in jejunum, as well
as the early and total apoptotic percentages in ileum.

Discussion
To achieve the optimal herd performance,
early weaning has become
a conventional method used in the pig industry. After weaning, young
pigs usually encounter three aspects of stressors, including nutrition,
psychology, and environment changes, which frequently result in pathogen
invasion, intestinal inflammation and intestinal dysfunction, and
subsequently jeopardize their health severely.18 Therefore, efficiency strategy is urgently needed. CGA,
one of the most representative polyphenols, has been shown to possess
various biological effects,14−16 which promote the application
of CGA in animal production.

Numerous studies in vivo and in
vitro have confirmed that CGA possesses
strong anti-inflammatory effects.10,19,20 Cytokines play important roles in the immune and
inflammatory responses.21 Among these,
TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 are the most important cytokines
released from various porcine immune cells, and the systemic TNF-α
concentration is considered as an indicator to monitor the severity
of systemic immunity in stress-challenged pigs.22,23 Previous studies showed that the levels of inflammatory cytokines
were increased at the early weaning process of pigs and subsequently
induced the intestinal damage.24,25 In the present study,
we found that CGA could decrease the serum TNF-α, IL-1β,
and IL-6 concentrations in weaned pigs, which is in accordance with
the results of the previous study in LPS-challenged rodents,26 indicating that dietary CGA supplementation
may alleviate the overstimulation of the systemic immunity and early
immune response in weaned pigs. IgG is one of the main components
of serum, which is considered as the important indicator to diagnose
immunological disorders.4 In the present
study, we found that the serum IgG concentration in the pigs fed with
the CGA-supplemented diet was improved. On the contrary, Ying et al.
(2009)20 reported that there was no significant
effect of CGA on the serum IgA, IgG and IgM in weaned pigs. A previous
study reported that the efficacy of the feed additive might be partly
depended on the health status of weaned pigs.27 Therefore, a possible explanation is that the piglets used in our
experiment may be in a vulnerable health status because of the weaning
stress, indicating the availability of the CGA supply under the current
experimental conditions.

SIgA, secreted by intestinal lamina
propria plasmacytes, acts as
the first line of specific defence and plays an important role in
the mucosal immune system of the intestine.28 It has been reported that the concentration of SIgA in intestine
reduced with the increasing number of bacteria adhered to the mucosa.29 Therefore, the SIgA concentration in intestine
is closely related with the intestinal mucosal immunity. Previous
studies reported that the weaning stress could easily trigger intestinal
inflammation in pigs.30 In the present
study, the concentration of SIgA in the jejunum was higher in pigs
fed with the CGA diet than those fed with the CON diet, suggesting
that the intestinal mucosal immunity of weaned pigs could be enhanced
by CGA.

An integrated intestinal villus–crypt morphological
structure
is very important in the digestion and absorption of nutrients and
to the intestinal immune barrier.31 Obvious
intestinal morphological changes, characterized by villous shedding,
villus atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia, could result in pathogenic
bacteria invasion, influence the digestion and absorption of nutrients,
and consequently lead to the stunted growth.31 Thus, maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal morphology
is the premise of body health. However, the weaning stress has been
reported to damage the intestinal mucosal integrity of pigs.32 In the present study, the small intestinal mucosal
morphology has been elevated by improving the villus height and the
villus width, which is in line with the previous result in LPS-challenged
weaned rodents.13 Moreover, in the present
study, we found that the VCR, an important parameter in evaluating
the nutrient digestion and absorption capacity,33 was significantly increased in the jejunum and ileum of
pigs fed the CGA-supplemented diet. Therefore, we speculated that
CGA can improve the intestinal development partly by enhancing the
integrity of the intestinal mucosal morphology.

The villus atrophy
and crypt hyperplasia of the small intestine
are partly attributed to the decreased proliferation and differentiation
of villus epithelial cells.34 Cell apoptosis,
a physiological process, plays a critical role in maintaining the
epithelial turnover of the intestinal mucosa by eliminating abnormal
or damaged cells.3,35 However, excessive apoptosis
inversely breaks the tissue homeostasis in intestinal epithelium and
finally leads to the intestinal mucosal barrier damage and gastrointestinal
disorders.35 Thus, it has been reported
that the balance between the cell proliferation and cell death, mainly
the apoptosis, was closely associated with the tissue growth.36 However, the weaning stress has been reported
to induce the small intestinal enterocyte apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest in pigs by causing oxidative stress, achieved by disrupting
the physiologic equilibrium of the oxidant and antioxidant.3 The results of the current study showed that
dietary CGA supplementation decreased the percentages of late and
total stage apoptotic cells in the jejunum, which are in accordance
with the results of previous studies in acetaminophen-challenged mice11 and MeHg-challenged PC12 cells,12 suggesting that CGA could suppress the weaning stress-induced
excessive apoptosis of the small intestinal epithelial cells, which
might be the partial reason why CGA could promote the improvement
of the intestinal morphology in weaned pigs. It is well-known that
the cell proliferation is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases, which
regulate the progression of cells from the G0/G1 phase into the S
phase of the cell cycle.37 In the present
study, we observed that CGA elevated the cell proliferation of small
intestinal epithelial cells by decreasing the proportion of the G0G1
phase, as well as increasing the proportion of the S phase and the
PI value. Numerous studies in vitro and in vivo have confirmed that
CGA is a potential polyphenolic antioxidant.12,19 In addition, Ying et al. (2009)20 reported
that CGA could enhance the antioxidant ability of weaned pigs by improving
the levels of GSH-Px and CAT and decreasing the content of MDA, which
may partly explain why CGA can regulate the negative effects of the
weaning stress on the intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and
apoptosis in piglets.

To further explore the mechanism underlying
the suppression effect
of CGA on the enterocyte apoptosis in weaned pigs, the expression
levels of apoptotic and antiapoptotic genes were evaluated. Generally,
the apoptosis response is regulated by either the intrinsic pathway
(mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway) or the extrinsic pathway
(Fas-dependent apoptosis pathway) in cells.3 In detail, the intrinsic pathway is mediated by mitochondria and
mainly represented by the activation of caspase-9,38 whereas the extrinsic pathway is mediated by the activation
of membrane death receptors, especially Fas, and mainly characterized
by the activation of caspase-8.39 Caspase-3
is an executioner caspase, which could be activated by these two pathways
and thus initiates the process of apoptosis.39,40 Weaning could induce the enterocyte apoptosis by increasing the
expressions of apoptotic genes and decreasing the antiapoptotic genes.3 Previous studies in vivo and in vitro reported
that CGA could inhibit the apoptosis by downregulating the expression
levels of antiapoptotic genes.11,12 Similarly, our present
study found that the mRNA expression levels of Fas, caspase-3, and
caspase-9 in the small intestine were downregulated by CGA, which
might partly explain the antiapoptosis effect of CGA in weaned pigs.
In addition, except for the cytokines, a higher level of caspase-3
is also a marker of the inflammatory response in the intestine.41 Therefore, our result further supported the
notion that dietary supplementation with CGA is effective in preventing
the intestinal inflammatory response in weaned pigs.

The Bcl-2
family includes pro-apoptotic Bax and antiapoptotic Bcl-2,
which are the main regulatory proteins involved in the intrinsic apoptosis
pathway and play critical roles in stress-induced apoptosis.42,43 The Bax protein could form a heterodimer with Bcl2 and then induce
apoptosis.44 In particular, previous studies
have confirmed that the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 acts as an essential regulated
factor in determining the cell susceptibility to apoptosis, and a
decreased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio is the essential factor in the suppression
of apoptosis.45,46 In the present study, dietary
CGA supplementation decreased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in the duodenum
and jejunum, which further explained the beneficial effect of CGA
on rendering the intestinal epithelial cells resistant to excessive
apoptosis in weaned pigs. Taken together, our present study provided
the first evidence in a weaned pig model that CGA could suppress the
excessive apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. However, the specific
mechanisms need further research.

In conclusion, to the best
of our knowledge, this study provides
new insights into the beneficial effects of dietary CGA supplementation
on the intestinal morphology and intestinal health, and the mechanisms
of action might be associated with an improvement in immune defense
and the suppression in excessive apoptosis of intestinal epithelial
cells.

Materials and Methods
Animal Care and Experimental Design
The experimental
protocol used in this study was approved by the Animal Care Advisory
Committee of the Sichuan Agricultural University. Twenty-four DLY
(Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire) weaned pigs (6.83 ±
0.10 kg) were randomly allocated to 2 treatment groups with 12 replicates
per treatment group and 1 pig per replicate. The two treatment groups
were as follows: the CON group, in which pigs were fed a basal diet
and the CGA group, in which pigs were fed the basal diet supplemented
with 1000 mg/kg CGA. The CGA was provided by China Animal Husbandry
Industry Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). The basal diet was formulated
to meet or exceed the National Research Council (NRC 2012)47 recommendations for the nutrient requirements
of piglets. Ingredient composition and nutrient levels were presented
in Table 5. All pigs
were housed in individual metabolism cages (0.7 × 1.5 m) and
were given ad libitum access to fresh water and feed. Room temperature
was maintained at 25–28 °C, and the relative humidity
was controlled at 55–65%. The experimental period lasted for
14 days.

were then collected after centrifugation at 3000g for 15 min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C for further
analysis. The same 16 pigs were euthanized with an intravenous injection
of chlorpromazine hydrochloride (3 mg/kg BW), and then the abdomen
was immediately opened to remove the small intestine. About 2.0 cm
segments of the middle of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were quickly
isolated, gently flushed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
and then preserved in PBS for flow cytometry. This was followed by
isolating and fixing the tissues of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum in
4% paraformaldehyde solution for histological analyses. After that,
the mucosa of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum was collected by scraping
using a sterile glass slide, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then
stored at −80 °C until the further analysis.

Measurement
of Serum Immunoglobulin Subsets and Cytokines
The levels
of serum immunoglobulin subsets (IgA and IgG) and cytokines
(TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1β) were measured by the sandwich
ELISA kits (Beijing winter song Boye Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Beijing,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance
(450 nm) was determined using a BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader
(BioTek Instruments, VT). The minimum detectable levels were 1.0 μg/mL
and 1.0 pg/mL for immunoglobulin subsets and cytokines, respectively.

Analysis of Mucosa Secretory IgA
About 1 g of the frozen
mucosa sample of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum)
was weighed, homogenized in ice-cold physiological saline (1:9, wt/vol),
and centrifuged at 2500g for 10 min at 4 °C,
and then the supernatant was collected for the determination of the
mucosa SIgA. The concentrations of SIgA in duodenum, jejunum, and
ileum were determined using the sandwich ELISA kits (Beijing winter
song Boye Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The minimum detectable level was
1.0 μg/mL.

Small Intestinal Morphology Analysis
The morphology
of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum was conducted according to our previous
report.34 Briefly, paraformaldehyde-fixed
small intestine samples were dehydrated with normal saline, embedded
in paraffin wax, and then cut into ∼5 μm transverse sections,
followed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin and sealing with a
neutral resin size. Intestinal mucosal morphology including villus
height, crypt depth, and villus width was determined with image processing
and analysis system (Image-Pro Plus 6.0, Media Cybernetics, Inc.,
Rockville, MD, USA). A minimum of 10 well-orientated villi and their
adjoined crypts from each intestinal segment were measured in triplicate.

Apoptosis of Small Intestinal Epithelial Cell by Flow Cytometry
The epithelial cells of duodenal, jejunal, and ileal were isolated
to measure the proportion of apoptotic cells, which were assessed
by flow cytometry with the PE Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) as previously described.48 Briefly, the excised fresh mucosal layer of
duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were immediately isolated and then ground
and filtered to form a cell suspension. The cells were carefully washed
twice with the ice-cold PBS and suspended in PBS at the density of
1 × 106 cells/mL. After that, a total of 100 μL
of the cell suspension was taken and placed into 5 mL streaming tubes,
and then 5 μL PE Annexin V and 5 μL 7-AAD were added.
The mixture was incubated for 15 min in the dark. Finally, 400 μL
of Annexin V binding buffer (1×) was added into the reaction
tubes and then mixed thoroughly. The apoptotic cells were examined
using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) within
1 h and 30 000 cells were used in each acquisition reading.

Cell Cycle of the Small Intestinal Epithelial Cell by Flow Cytometry
Likewise, a total of 100 μL of the cell suspension was taken
and placed into a 5 mL streaming tubes, and then 1 mL Triton X-100
was added. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C and then
centrifuged. After washing twice with PBS, 5 μL of 7-AAD was
added and then the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in
the dark. Subsequently, 400 μL of PBS was added and then mixed
thoroughly. The cell cycle distribution was analyzed using a CytoFLEX
flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) within 1 h. The PI
was carried out by the formula: PI = (S + G2M)/(G0G1 + S + G2M) ×
100%.

Total RNA Extraction and Gene Expression Analysis
Total
RNA of the small intestinal mucosa (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum)
was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) following
the manufacturer’s protocols. The integrity of RNA was checked
by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. The concentration and purity
of RNA were determined from OD 260/280 readings (ratio = 1.8–2.0)
using a spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, DU 800; Beckman Coulter
Inc). Reverse transcription was performed using the PrimeScript RT
reagent kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The primers were synthesized commercially by Life Technologies
Limited and are shown in Table 6.

Quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted
to analyze the mRNA expression levels of Fas, Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3,
caspase-8, and caspase-9 in the small intestinal mucosa using the
CFX-96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Premix Ex
Taq II (Tli RNaseH Plus) reagents (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The PCR
reaction was run in a 10 μL reaction volume, which contained
5 μL of SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Tli RNaseH Plus), 0.2 μL
of ROX reference dye II (50×), 0.4 μL of each primer, 1 μLl
of the cDNA sample, and 3 μLl of double-distilled H2O. The PCR cycling parameters were as follows: initial denaturation
at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5
s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 5 min. A melting curve
analysis was performed following each real-time quantitative PCR assay
to verify the specificity of the reactions. Each sample was tested
simultaneously in triplicate on the same PCR plate. The relative levels
of the mRNA expression of target genes were calculated using the 2–ΔΔCT method,49 and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used
as the house-keeping gene.

Statistical Analysis
The normality
test was performed
by the Shapiro–Wilk test, and the analyses were performed by T-test using the statistical program SAS 9.4 (SAS Inst.,
Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Each pig was considered as an experimental unit.
The results were expressed as mean values and using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images. Statistical significance and a tendency toward
difference were considered as P < 0.05 and P < 0.10, respectively.
