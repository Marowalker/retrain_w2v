Different
bacterial types and their living environments can lead
to different saturations in the chains of their membrane lipids. Such
structural differences may influence the efficacy of antibiotics that
target bacterial membranes. In this work, the effects of acyl chain
saturation on the binding of an antimicrobial peptide G4 have been examined as a function of the packing density of lipid
monolayers by combining external reflection Fourier transform infrared
(ER-FTIR) spectroscopy and neutron reflection (NR) measurements. Langmuir
monolayers were formed from 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DPPG) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (POPG),
respectively, with the initial surface pressures controlled at 8 and
28 mN/m. A reduction in the order of the acyl chains associated with
the increase in the layer thickness upon G4 binding was
revealed from ER-FTIR spectroscopy, with peptide binding reaching
equilibration faster in POPG than in DPPG monolayers. Whereas the
dynamic DPPG-binding process displayed a steady increase in the amide
I band area, the POPG-binding process showed little change in the
amide area after the initial period. The peptide amide I area from
ER-FTIR spectroscopy could be linearly correlated with the adsorbed
G4 amount from NR, irrespective of time, initial pressure,
or chain saturation, with clearly more peptide incorporated into the
DPPG monolayer. Furthermore, NR revealed that although the peptide
was associated with both POPG and DPPG lipid monolayers, it was more
extensively distributed in the latter, showing that acyl chain saturation
clearly promoted peptide binding and structural disruption.

1 Introduction
Antibacterial
resistance is fast becoming a global healthcare issue
as the current stockpile of working antibiotics and reserves are dwindling.
Over the past 2–3 decades, few new antibiotics have been discovered,1 but resistant superbugs are on the rise, making
many potent antibiotic treatments less effective. We are once again
under great pressure to develop new antibiotic drugs with improved
performance against resistant strains.2

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising antibacterial
agents
because they kill bacteria by disrupting their membranes. This mechanism
of action makes it difficult for bacteria to develop resistance.3,4 Extensive studies have been undertaken to search for novel AMPs
from various origins and sources. Many natural AMPs, such as melittin,
have potent antibacterial effect, but they may also have high hemolytic
activity.5 Furthermore, natural AMPs often
have long and complex sequences with other known and unknown biological
functions. These aspects limit their practical use. Rational design
of new AMPs aims to achieve high bactericidal activity and low toxicity
while keeping the sequence simple and the length short.6 In this respect, we have designed, synthesized,
and examined a series of cationic AMPs with the sequence of G(IIKK)nI-NH2, where n denotes the number of α-helical repeats (n = 2–4, denoted as G2, G3, and G4, respectively).7,8 G3 and G4 peptides possess strong antibacterial activity against both
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria while remaining benign to
mammalian host cells under coculturing.9 They display minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs) as low as
many antibiotics, often in the region of 1–10 μM. Some
MICs against typical bacteria and EC50 values (concentration to induce
50% lysis) against human red blood cells (hRBCs) from G3 and G4 peptides, together with the molecular structure
and helical projection for G4 are shown in Figure S1; these values are compared to those
from the widely studied peptides, including LL37, melittin, magainin-2,
and ampicillin. G3 and G4 can clearly act as
effective bactericides while displaying attractive biocompatibility.
However, we still do not have the molecular level of understanding
about the exact mechanistic processes that lead to the selective killing
of bacteria. Neutron reflection (NR) in combination with deuterium
labelling helps unravel structural details about how AMPs interact
with model lipid membranes.10,11 Such structural information
provides direct insight into the mode of membrane disruption by AMPs,
which is important for developing more potent and more selective targets.

Most of the natural and designed AMPs reported so far are cationic.
As the physicochemical nature of membrane lipids is crucial in determining
the structure and properties of biological membranes, a higher proportion
of anionic lipids on the bacterial membrane surface, together with
the presence of lipopolysaccharides, and a significantly higher electrical
potential (−130 to −150 mV) as compared to mammalian
cell membranes are some of the key aspects that determine the selective
activity of many AMPs. However, the potency could be affected by many
other factors such as membrane structure and composition as well as
environmental conditions, including temperature, pH, and ions.12,13 Under normal physiological conditions, most phospholipids from Gram-negative
bacteria contain saturated and monounsaturated acyl chains and they
exist in a liquid-crystalline state to maintain the fluidity of the
membranes.14 Upon the influence of environmental
factors such as temperature, the bacteria regulate the fluidity by
changing the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids,15,16 acyl chain length,17 and lateral membrane
compressibility. Therefore, it is important to establish how these
changes influence their interaction with antimicrobial agents and
their selective responses to mammalian host cells.

Previous
studies have reported how alterations in the lipid acyl
chain saturation, head group, and packing density influence the interaction
between AMPs and membranes.18−20 For example, using Langmuir monolayers,
Ishitsuka et al.21 examined how membrane
properties affect the initial membrane selectivity of protegrin-1
(PG-1) by employing a constant pressure insertion assay and fluorescence
microscopy. By using lipids with different head groups and tail saturations,
they demonstrated that, besides the preferential peptide binding to
the anionic lipids, increase in acyl tail unsaturation led to the
enhancement of PG-1 insertion into the lipid monolayers. PG-1 binding
was, however, examined in their work by following the area expansion
at a constant surface pressure of 25–30 mN/m. This approach
has many limitations as the amount of bound peptide and the nature
of interactions can be very different. Other studies involving PGLa
(a helical 21-residue member of the magainin family) have shown that
the peptide changes its membrane alignment and insertion not only
in a concentration- or lipid composition-dependent manner,22,23 but they are also influenced by the lipid chain length and phase
state, with the membrane responding by changing the thickness depending
on the match of hydrophobic moieties of the lipid and peptide.24 Therefore, many factors affect how AMPs interact
with membranes, and apart from the influences from different AMPs,
the exact molecular structure and composition of the lipid model systems
can have a huge influence on the outcome of the experimental results.

To date, there have been more than 5000 AMPs reported.25 Against natural AMPs with long sequences and
complex structures, rationally designed ones are structurally simple
and thus allow easier structure–activity relations to be established.4 Among various AMPs examined by us, G3 and G4 are the most representative, possessing strong
antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria, with little hemolytic activities even at concentrations
of 10-fold of MICs. These AMPs adopt nonordered structures in aqueous
solution, but upon exposure to anionic membranes, they transform into
helical structures. This structural transition is thought to enhance
their membrane-disrupting propensity. In our previous studies on the
implications of lipid monolayer charge characteristics on their interactions
with G4, we showed that the peptide was largely associated
with the head group region of the 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) monolayer, whereas it was able to
penetrate the lipid acyl chain region of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DPPG,
sodium salt) monolayer as well and remove the lipids from the interface.
Thus, electrostatic interaction strengthened the hydrophobic interaction,
and the combined molecular interactive processes increased the power
of G4 in disturbing the charged membranes.26

Following our previous studies, we have recently
examined how lipid
packing and acyl chain saturation influence the selective interactions
between the G4 peptide and model lipid monolayers. Anionic
saturated DPPG and unsaturated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (POPG,
sodium salt), which contain one saturated and one unsaturated acyl
chain, have been used to form model lipid monolayers. By combining
the measurements from the surface pressure, external reflection Fourier
transform infrared (ER-FTIR) spectroscopy, and NR, we have examined
how these lipid monolayers were affected by G4 binding.
The results revealed some fascinating insight into the influence of
saturation on the amount and distribution of the G4 peptide
bound into different parts of the model lipid monolayers. These observations
provide useful missing information about the mechanistic processes
of the actions of AMPs into cell membranes bearing different extents
of acyl chain saturation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Surface Pressure Measurements
The
surface pressure–area (π–A) isotherms
for DPPG and POPG monolayers on the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
subphase are shown in Figure 1a. Both hydrogenous and deuterated DPPG monolayers present
a liquid-expanded (LE) phase at a low surface pressure, followed by
a liquid-expanded and liquid-condensed (LE–LC) coexistence
region. Further compression leads to an LC phase, characterized by
a longer ranged molecular order and lower compressibility.27 The small differences observed arise from the
slightly different interatomic interactions between hydrogenous and
deuterated acyl chains.28 On the other
hand, for the partially unsaturated POPG, neither h- nor d-lipid presents
any marked phase transition, consistent with the data reported in
the literature,29 and there are no differences
observed between the two isotopic analogues. Under the low lateral
packing condition at a surface pressure of 8 mN/m, DPPG gives an area
per molecule of ∼87 Å2 and POPG gives ∼100
Å2. Under high packing at a surface pressure of 28
mN/m, consistent with the lipid packing in real biomembranes, the
area per molecule was ∼45 Å2 for DPPG and ∼66
Å2 for POPG. As the head groups of the lipids are
the same, the physical state of the lipids is clearly influenced by
the type of the acyl chain, which may impact the interaction of the
peptides with the lipid monolayers.

Figure 1 (a) Surface pressure (π) vs area
per molecule for hydrogenous
and deuterated DPPG and POPG on the surface of PBS, with πi indicating the initial surface pressures at which the peptide
would be injected; (b) surface pressure against time showing the changes
in π after G4 injection under DPPG monolayers at
initial pressures of 8, 15 and 28 mN/m and POPG monolayers at initial
pressures of 8 and 28 mN/m; (c) maximum insertion pressure (MIP) of
G4 into DPPG and POPG monolayers.

The first binding studies between the peptide and the lipid
monolayers
were performed by monitoring the pressure changes over time after
peptide injection under the monolayers while keeping the area constant.
Changes in the surface pressure (Δπ) after peptide injection
are influenced by the association of the peptide into the lipid monolayer,30 where Δπ = πe –
πi, πe = equilibrium coadsorption
pressure, and πi = initial surface pressure. Figure 1b shows the different
binding kinetic processes under the initial injection pressures of
8 (just below the LE–LC coexistence region), 15 (just above
the LE–LC coexistence region), and 28 mN/m for DPPG (LC phase),
and 8 and 28 mN/m for POPG. In the case of POPG, peptide binding was
not studied at the initial pressure of 15 mN/m as POPG does not present
any marked transition region. The slowest kinetic process was observed
at a low initial pressure of 8 mN/m for both lipids, with the pressure
reaching equilibrium 40 min after injection. At a high pressure of
28 mN/m, the equilibrium was reached within 10 min, with the kinetics
presenting a transitional phase of pressure overshooting, followed
by subsequent relaxation. From the interactions between cardiotoxins
and phospholipids, Bougis et al.31 explained
the pressure state of overshoot by the initial quick change of the
bound peptide orientation from “flat” to “edgewise”
after adsorption and the subsequent membrane disorganisation.32 The different time period required for the pressure
increase to reach equilibrium suggests that the increase in the lipid
packing density promoted the binding and the association of the peptide
into the lipid monolayer.

Differences in Δπ from
peptide binding reflect the
influence of the initial surface pressure on the amount of peptide
inserted into the packed monolayers and subsequent interactions. Although
the main driving forces in the initial binding of G4 to
the DPPG and POPG are of electrostatic nature,26 the peptide could penetrate into the monolayer through
hydrophobic interactions, which is evident from the increase in the
surface pressure at each initial surface pressure.

Figure 1c shows
the plots of Δπ as a function of πi from
G4 binding to DPPG and POPG monolayers, from which the
MIP can be calculated by extrapolating the regression of each plot
to the π axis.33 Given that the MIP
corresponds to the surface pressure above which the peptide cannot
insert anymore into the monolayer, we can see that for both DPPG and
POPG, the MIP is around 43 mN/m. As this value is higher than the
lateral pressure in the biological membranes,34 we can examine how the G4 peptide inserts into and perturbs
the bacterial membranes. In a previous study, Chen et al.8 compared Δπ of G3 interacting
with DPPC and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC) at a final peptide concentration of 3 μM, injected at
the initial surface pressure of 30 mN/m. Δπ for DPPC was
3.5 and 10 mN/m for POPC. These changes are small, and when compared
with our observations on the G4 interaction with DPPG and
POPG, they show the dominant effect of electrostatic interaction from
anionic lipids. By contrast, increase in fluidity upon mixing must
have also favored peptide penetration.

2.2 Secondary
Structures Measured from ER-FTIR
Spectroscopy
ER-FTIR spectroscopy measurements were performed
to examine the structural implications arising from the influences
of lipid packing and the acyl chain saturation upon G4 peptide
binding to the lipid monolayers. We first measured the spectra from
the DPPG and POPG monolayers alone at surface pressures of 8, 15,
and 28 mN/m. The CH-stretching peaks provide information on the density
of the acyl chain region and are related to lipid ordering.35 The results shown in Figure S2 suggest an increase in the order and packing with increasing
pressure. However, at each of the pressures measured, the unsaturated
POPG layers present less order in the lipid tails than that from the
respective saturated DPPG monolayers. These results agree well with
the trend observed from the area per molecule values from DPPG and
POPG monolayers, as calculated from the π–A curves under these surface pressures (Figure 1a), showing a clear effect of unsaturation
on lipid packing.

Figure 2 shows the CH-stretching (Figure 2a,c) and amide I (Figure 2b,d) bands of ER-FTIR spectra before and
after G4 interaction with DPPG (Figure 2a,b) and POPG (Figure 2c,d) monolayers. The initial binding led
to a time-dependent process. The spectra shown in Figure 2 were recorded over the first
130 min period. The initial surface pressure at which the peptide
was injected was at 28 mN/m. It should be noted that in Figure 2a, the baseline has been slightly
corrected to make an easier comparison before and after peptide injection.
The CH-stretching bands of the DPPG monolayers before and after peptide
adsorption (Figure 2a) are characterized by the peaks observed for the CH2 asymmetric stretching (at 2918 cm–1), CH2 symmetric stretching (2859 cm–1), and CH3 symmetric stretching (2959 cm–1). However, the
peak areas in the case of CH2 asymmetric and symmetric
stretches decrease with time, with the time-dependent peak area changes
for the CH2 asymmetric stretching shown in Figure 3. The C=O stretching
band, which arose from the ester carbonyl groups of the lipids before
peptide injection, consisted of two bands at 1738 and 1724 cm–1. The more pronounced band at 1738 cm–1 corresponds to the C=O mode of the sn-1 chain with a trans-conformation
in the C–C bond adjacent to the ester group, whereas the C=O
frequency at 1724 cm–1 of the sn-2 chain corresponds
to the presence of a gauche band in that position.36 After peptide addition, the peak area of the C=O
band decreased, and the gauche conformation favoring the band at 1724
cm–1 became more pronounced, suggesting that peptide
penetration could induce a decrease in the molecular order of the
lipid structure by forcing the acyl chains to be more stretched.37

Figure 2 CH2 symmetric (2850 cm–1)
and asymmetric
(2920 cm–1) stretching bands obtained before (black
line) and at equilibrium after G4 adsorption (gray dashed
line) to DPPG (a) and POPG (c) lipid monolayers, with the peptide
injected at an initial pressure of 28 mN/m. The amide I band appearance
changes over 130 min time period for DPPG (b) and POPG (d), with the
gray dotted lines indicating the peak transitions over time from 1640
to 1647 cm–1.

Figure 3 Amide I and CH2 asymmetric stretching (as) peak areas
vs time plots for G4 adsorption to DPPG and POPG monolayers
at initial surface pressures of 8 and 28 mN/m. Time zero corresponded
to the values just before peptide addition.

G4 adsorption was observed by a gradual increase
in
the amide I band for 130 min (Figure 2b). A broadening and increase in the peak area has
been observed, together with the appearance of a shoulder and eventually
the main peak shifting from 1640 to 1647 cm–1. These
features can be explained in terms of a change from a completely random
coil conformation to an increased α-helix structure. The observations
regarding the conformational changes of G4 from a nonordered
to a more α-helical structure agree well with our previous circular
dichroism studies on the interactions of DPPC and DPPG liposomes with
the peptide, showing that the peptides remained unfolded when exposed
to DPPC vesicles but that they adopted α-helical structures
when exposed to negatively charged DPPG vesicles.7

ER-FTIR spectra of the POPG interaction with G4 injected
at an initial surface pressure of 28 mN/m are shown in Figure 2c,d. Similar to the DPPG monolayer,
the CH2-stretching bands of POPG underwent a decrease in
the respective peak areas. In addition, the CH3 band peak
area increased in contrast to an almost constant area, as observed
from DPPG, and a slight shift toward higher frequencies in all peak
positions was observed. The C=O stretching band underwent striking
changes, with the peak area decreasing until its complete disappearance.
The more intense band at 1738 cm–1 initially shifted
toward higher frequency and eventually disappeared. The amide I band
showed similar features to that for the binding of the peptide to
the DPPG monolayer, with a similar trend of peak area increase and
the appearance of a shoulder at 1646 cm–1, again
bearing the hallmark of α-helix structure formation.

The
results regarding the peptide effect over time on the appearance
of the CH2, C=O, and amide I bands from DPPG and
POPG monolayers injected at the initial surface pressure of 8 mN/m
are shown in Figure S3. The changes were
similar to those observed at a higher pressure for both lipids, with
the CH2 and C=O stretch peak areas decreasing and
the appearance of a second band at 1647 cm–1 in
the amide I peak, consistent with the gradual appearance of the α-helix
structure once associated with the lipid monolayers.

The dynamic
changes upon binding of G4 to DPPG and POPG
monolayers, as measured by monitoring the peptide amide I peak area
and CH2 asymmetric stretching peak area of the lipids,
are shown in Figure 3. The errors bars represent the uncertainty of the measurements and
are estimated to be 3–5%. For both lipid monolayers at initial
injection pressures of 8 and 28 mN/m, the peptide amide I bands appeared
in the first 3 min after peptide injection, showing its fast adsorption
to the lipid interfaces. In the case of DPPG monolayers, the adsorption
plateaued after approximately 40 min, and a slight increase of about
5% was observed over the entire time period of 130 min. The peptide
amide I peak area almost doubled as a result of the increase in the
initial surface pressure from 8 to 28 mN/m. This increase in peak
area could arise from either a higher amount or altered structural
conformation of the peptide bound to the lipid interface. In the case
of peptide bound to the POPG monolayers, however, the initial surface
pressure change over the same range did not have any effect on the
peptide amide I peak area, implying that the increased packing in
the POPG monolayer over this pressure range did not cause any measurable
difference in the amount or conformational change of the peptide.
These results together imply the important role played by the acyl
chain saturation in the interaction between the antimicrobial peptide
and the model lipid monolayer. By contrast, a decrease in the peak
area of the CH2 asymmetric stretching under these pressures
has been observed for all cases. As explained already, this could
arise from the reduced lipid layer order or even lipid loss upon peptide
binding.

2.3 Interfacial Structures before and after Peptide
Binding Measured from NR
2.3.1 Low Q Analysis of Peptide-Binding
Dynamics
To quantify how the surface concentrations of peptide
and lipids change with time during the initial binding processes,
we have followed reflectivity changes over the low-Q range using the isotopic contrasts of deuterated and hydrogenous
[or contrast-matched (“cm”)] lipids on null reflecting
water (NRW). Each NR profile was acquired at a low incident angle
of 0.62° over a duration of 4 min and was analyzed following
the procedures described previously.26Figure 4 shows the plots
of the surface concentrations against time for both peptide and lipids
at initial pressure values of 8, 15, and 28 mN/m for DPPG and 8 and
28 mN/m for POPG monolayers. The statistical error bars from the data
were estimated to be 2–5% of the final value for the lipids
and 10% of the peptide final value. The data show that in the case
of DPPG, equilibrium was reached after 45–60 min, with the
peptide amount increasing as a function of lipid packing. The final
peptide surface concentrations after 80 min for the peptide bound
to DPPG at the initial surface pressures of 8, 15, and 28 mN/m were
0.52, 0.73, and 0.96 μmol/m2, respectively. In the
case of POPG monolayers, the equilibrium-adsorbed amount was reached
much faster, after ∼20 min, and the peptide amount was independent
of the initial packing of the lipid monolayer, with values around
0.35 μmol/m2. These changes are in support of the
amide I peak area that changes over time in the ER-FTIR spectroscopy
measurements (Figure 2). When plotting the amide I peak area versus peptide surface concentration,
a linear relationship between the two quantities was observed (Figure S4).

Figure 4 Surface concentration values Γ vs
time showing the simultaneous
binding of G4 to the interface of DPPG and POPG monolayers.
The reduction in the surface concentrations of the lipids demonstrates
lipid loss. The data point at time = zero represents the Γ values
before peptide addition.

2.3.2 Structural Analysis To Lipid Monolayers
before Peptide Binding
The DPPG and POPG monolayer structures
at the initial surface pressures of 8 and 28 mN/m were determined
by NR, and the reflectivity profiles were recorded in 4 isotopic contrasts:
cm-lipid or h-lipid on NRW, d-lipid on NRW, cm-lipid or h-lipid on
D2O, and d-lipid on D2O. These neutron reflectivity
profiles were fitted assuming a two-layer model with the first layer
containing the lipid tail region in air and the second layer containing
hydrated head groups. Figures S5 and S6 show the model fits to the measured data from both DPPG and POPG
monolayers at the low and high initial surface pressures. The structural
parameters obtained from the fits are summarized in Table 1.

a The errors denote the range of variations
beyond which deviations in reflectivity fitting become noticeable.

The thicknesses of the acyl
chain layers (τ1)
for DPPG and POPG at the initial pressure of 8 mN/m were found to
be ∼13.5 Å, with a coverage of ∼70%. The thicknesses
of the head group layers (τ2) were also comparable,
with values around 7.5 Å, with 11–14 water molecules per
lipid head to fill the remaining space. At the initial surface pressure
of 28 mN/m, the DPPG tail thickness increased to 17.9 Å, close
to the value for the fully extended length of the dipalmitoyl chain,38 suggesting that the DPPG monolayers were in
an untilted condensed phase. By contrast, the acyl chain thickness
of the POPG monolayer was ∼14.5 Å, in agreement with the
results from Kučerka et al.39 and
Pan et al.40 for POPC and POPG lipid bilayers.
The thickness of the DPPG head group was ∼10.5 Å and was
associated with 7 water molecules, whereas POPG had a smaller head
group thickness of ∼9 Å, with 9.5 water molecules per
lipid. The area per lipid molecule was comparable with those calculated
from the π–A isotherms (see Figure 1a), with values of
88 ± 4 and 93 ± 4 Å2 at 8 mN/m, and 47.5
± 2 and 70 ± 2 Å2 at 28 mN/m for DPPG and
POPG, respectively. The errors quoted indicate the range of sensitive
changes in reflectivity beyond which visual deviations could be observed
between the calculated and measured profiles. These errors were larger
than the sum of statistical and fitting errors.

2.3.3 Structural Analysis of Equilibrium-Adsorbed
G4 To DPPG and POPG Monolayers
2.3.3.1 DPPG
Monolayer Structure after G4 Binding
A two-layer
model as described above was satisfactory
for the low lipid packing at the initial pressure of 8 mN/m after
G4 with peptide located in both the chain and head group
regions of the monolayer. But at the initial pressure of 28 mN/m,
the data had to be fitted using a three-layer model to account for
the distribution of peptide into the aqueous phase. The best fitted
parameters are summarized in Table 2. Figure 5 shows an example of the fitted NR data and the associated scattering
length density (SLD) profiles before and after exposure to G4 for two isotopic contrasts, contrast-matched lipids on NRW, and
tail-deuterated lipids on D2O. For a full set of four contrasts,
the model fits to the data for the equilibrium-adsorbed G4 to DPPG monolayers at the low and high initial surface pressures
are shown in Figure S7.

At the initial
surface pressure of 8 mN/m, peptide association
increased the thicknesses of both acyl chain and head group layers,
with the former increasing by 2 Å and the latter by 3 Å.
The lipid volume fractions decreased from 0.7 to 0.4 in the first
layer and from 0.46 to 0.21 in the second layer, with the head group
hydration increasing by 10%. The peptide occupied a volume fraction
of 0.52 in the first layer and 0.15 in the second layer. The final
surface concentration of peptide was calculated to be 0.52 μmol/m2, consistent with that from the low-Q analysis.
84% of the total peptide adsorbed was distributed in the acyl chain
region, and 16% of it was mixed into the head group region. However,
the lipid surface concentration decreased from 1.90 to 1.25 μmol/m2, confirming that almost 30% of lipids were removed from the
interface as a result of peptide binding.

At the initial surface
pressure of 28 mN/m, the thickness of the
acyl chain layer increased by 1.5 Å and that of the head group
layer increased by 3 Å. The thickness of the peptide-only third
layer was found to be 14 Å. Similar changes in the lipid volume
fraction and head group hydration were observed in the lower lipid
packing case. In the third layer, the peptide occupied a volume fraction
of 0.61, with the remaining space filled by water. The surface concentration
of the peptide was calculated to be 0.9 μmol/m2,
with 21% in the acyl chain region, 25% in the head group region, and
54% in the peptide-only layer. The DPPG surface concentration decreased
from 3.5 to 3.0 μmol/m2.

2.3.3.2 POPG
Monolayer Structure after G4 Binding
The two-layer
model as described above was found
to be satisfactory for both the initial surface pressures of 8 and
28 mN/m because of the low amount of the bound peptide. The best fitted
parameters are listed in Table 3. To keep the consistency with the DPPG monolayer at the same
initial surface pressure, the three-layer model was also used; but
the peptide layer (the third layer) had a high percentage of solvent
of some 90%. Figure 6 shows the best-fitted NR data and the associated SLD profiles from
two isotopic contrasts before and after exposure to G4,
that is, hydrogenous lipid on NRW and partially tail-deuterated lipids
on D2O. The model analysis for all four measured isotopic
contrasts and the associated SLD profiles under equilibrium G4 binding to POPG monolayers at the initial surface pressures
of 8 and 28 mN/m are shown in Figure S8.

to the POPG monolayers under equilibration before and after G4 binding at the initial surface pressures of (a) 8 and (b)

and deuterated lipids on D2O. The SLD profiles of the fits
as a function of distance are represented in the insets, where the
grey dotted line denotes the distribution of acyl chains and head
groups of POPG monolayer before peptide injection, and the black continuous
line represents the distribution of acyl chains, head groups and peptide,
after G4 binding to POPG monolayer.

Upon G4 binding, the acyl chain thickness
increased
by 1.5 Å in both cases of low and high initial lipid packing.
However, the thickness of the head group region increased by 2.3 Å
at 8 mN/m and by 9 Å at 28 mN/m. For the peptide injected at
the surface pressure of 8 mN/m, the reductions in the acyl chain and
head group layer volume fractions were similar to those observed from
the DPPG monolayers. The final surface concentration of the peptide
was 0.39 μmol/m2, with 85% in the first acyl chain
layer and 15% in the second head group layer, again similar to that
found in the DPPG monolayer. Upon peptide injection into the POPG
monolayer at the higher surface pressure, the final peptide surface
concentration was 0.35 μmol/m2 and thus remained
close to that observed at the low initial surface pressure; but the
peptide was distributed very differently, with 57% found in the acyl
chain region and 43% in the lipid head group region. It is thus clear
that the packing density within the POPG monolayer influenced the
peptide distribution even though the physical state of the POPG lipid
monolayer did not influence the bound peptide amount. This feature
is similar to what was observed from G4 binding to the
DPPG monolayer, but the peptide distribution was more extensive and
further stretched into the water phase because of greater peptide
incorporation.

From the binding of G4 to either DPPG
or POPG monolayers,
the acyl chain thicknesses increased by around 2 Å, suggesting
that the peptide interacted with the lipid tails and caused them to
be more extended. Also, as observed in FTIR spectroscopy measurements,
the tails become less ordered. By contrast, the changes in the head
group region vary with the tail saturation and monolayer compression.
At a low initial surface pressure of 8 mN/m, the head group layer
changes were similar for both DPPG and POPG. At a high surface pressure
of 28 mN/m, the changes were more striking, with the head group layer
almost doubling in thickness for POPG as a result of the peptide binding.
For peptide binding to the DPPG monolayer, a third layer of peptide
was clearly formed underneath an already thickened head group layer,
suggesting a higher affinity of the peptide toward the saturated and
more densely packed DPPG monolayer compared with POPG. Figure 7 shows schematic representations
of the equilibrium interfacial structures of G4 associated
with DPPG and POPG monolayers based on the ER-FTIR spectroscopy and
NR results.

Figure 7 Schematic representations of the interfacial structures upon G4 peptide binding to DPPG and POPG monolayers at the initial
surface pressures of 8 and 28 mN/m.

In spite of the different amounts and locations of the association
of the G4 peptide in the DPPG and POPG monolayers as unravelled
from NR, ER-FTIR spectroscopy revealed the formation of secondary
structures, characteristic of the α-helix conformation in both
cases. Interestingly however, these changes do not show any clear
correlation with the trend of surface pressure increase. As shown
in Figure 1c, the surface
pressure increase upon peptide binding decreases almost linearly with
respect to the initial surface pressure, and there is little difference
between DPPG and POPG, apparently showing little effect from saturation.
In light of the almost constant G4 adsorbed amount in POPG
monolayers at different initial surface pressures, the peptide must
interact with the lipid monolayers very differently to incur the observed
different pressure increases; a clear piece of evidence is from the
different peptide distributions under the two different initial pressures,
as revealed by NR. In the case of peptide binding to DPPG monolayers,
the amount of peptide associated was found to increase with the initial
surface pressure. This trend might be opposite to the intuitive expectation,
but shows the dominant entropic effect in driving peptide association
into the saturated acyl chain region.

In contrast to the ER-FTIR
spectroscopy and NR work reported here,
Ishitsuka et al.21 examined the binding
of PG-1 by following the area expansion under a constant pressure
of 25 mN/m. They observed that PG-1 binding to lipid monolayers with
greater unsaturation acyl chains led to enhanced area expansion than
to those with fully saturated acyl chains. On the basis of these observations,
they concluded that PG-1 preferred to bind to lipids with unsaturated
chains. Against the NR and ER-FTIR spectroscopy results from this
work and the discussion above, however, the actual situation could
be more complex with regard to the amount and location of the bound
peptide and the influence on its interaction with the lipid monolayer.
The outcome in the surface pressure increase or area expansion must
be system-dependent, as is evident from the differences observed between
PG-1 and G4.

3 Conclusions
Changes in the living environment can drive bacteria to regulate
the fluidity of their membranes by altering the ratio of saturated
to unsaturated fatty acids,15,16 acyl chain length,17 and membrane compressibility. Using a combination
of surface pressure measurements, ER-FTIR spectroscopy, and NR, this
work has examined how acyl chain saturation affects the binding of
the antimicrobial peptide G4 to spread DPPG and POPG monolayers
at different surface pressures. By following the symmetric and asymmetric
CH2-stretching bands, the ER-FTIR spectra revealed a reduction
in the order of the acyl chains and an increase in the layer thickness,
suggesting the thickening of both DPPG and POPG monolayers upon G4 binding. The increase in the amide I area upon peptide binding
to POPG monolayers was low, independent of surface pressure change,
and the process became equilibrated in 20 min. By contrast, peptide
binding to DPPG monolayers reached equilibration over a longer period,
and the process led to a greater increase in the amide I area and
was surface pressure-dependent, with the final amide I area doubled
as the initial pressure increases from 8 to 28 mN/m. These differences
clearly demonstrate a strong impact of acyl chain saturation. The
almost constant amide I area, as observed from the peptide binding
to the POPG monolayers, was consistent with the constant adsorbed
amount, as revealed from NR. In fact, all data of the amide I band
from the peptide obtained in this work could be linearly correlated
with the G4 adsorbed amount (see Figure S4).

A detailed structural analysis from NR revealed
very different
associations of the peptide to POPG and DPPG monolayers. The peptide
was associated with the POPG lipid monolayer, whereas it was also
distributed into the water underneath the DPPG monolayer at the highest
surface pressure measured. These differences in the amount and distribution
of peptide binding may be linked to different membrane disruption
power as a result of acyl chain saturation. Therefore, this work provides
a mechanistic basis to explain how changes in the acyl chain saturation
of membranes could influence their interaction with antibacterial
agents.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
The lipids were purchased
from Avanti Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification.
Tail-deuterated DPPG (sodium salt, d62-DPPG) and hydrogenous DPPG (sodium salt, h-DPPG) were dissolved
in chloroform/methanol (9:1). Partially tail-deuterated POPG (sodium
salt, d31-POPG) and hydrogenous POPG (sodium
salt, h-POPG) were prepared in chloroform solution. The G(IIKK)4I-NH2 peptide (G4) was supplied by Shanghai
Top-Peptide Bio Co Ltd with 98% purity and was synthesized using the
standard Fmoc method, with the method previously described by Hu et
al.,7 and was used as received. A schematic
representation of its structure is shown in Figure S1a–c in
the Supporting Information. The peptide
stock solution (0.2 mM) was prepared in PBS solution (10 mM, 137 mM
NaCl, pH = 7.4) using UHQ (Elgastat ultrapure water) grade water.
All other chemicals were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. MICs against typical
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and EC50 values against hRBCs
from G3 and G4 are compared to the values reported
for known peptides and ampicillin in Figure S1d.

4.2 Surface Pressure Experiments
Lipid
monolayers were created at the air/water interface using a custom-made
Langmuir trough (Nima Technology), as previously described.26 The trough was specially designed to facilitate
NR with sufficient flat beam footprint and a low liquid volume while
allowing simultaneous surface pressure monitoring. The experiments
were carried out at two initial surface pressures of 8 and 28 mN/m,
which account for low and high lateral lipid packings, respectively.
For the interaction measurements, the constant area method was used.
The monolayer was compressed to the required surface pressure, and
after it became stabilized, we fixed the barrier position, and a certain
amount of peptide stock solution was injected to reach a final peptide
concentration in the subphase of 3 μM. Peptide injection was
carefully operated underneath the barrier, and using a long and specially
bent needle, the liquid was gently and steadily injected over the
widest area possible to ensure the best mixing in the bulk while retaining
the minimum disturbance to the surface of the lipid monolayer. The
entire injection process was completed within about 1 min. The pressure
changes versus time were monitored for up to 3 h after peptide injection.
All experiments were repeated three times and were performed at the
room temperature of 21 ± 2 °C. In the NR experiments, when
performing the POPG monolayer measurements, the trough was placed
in a sealed box and purged with nitrogen to prevent the oxidation
of unsaturated POPG acyl chains.

4.3 ER-FTIR
Spectroscopy
ER-FTIR spectroscopy
measurements were performed using a Thermo Nicolet IS-50 instrument
(Thermo Scientific, Madison WI, USA) equipped with a mercury cadmium
telluride detector, which was cooled with liquid nitrogen, and an
air drier system (Peak Scientific, Scotland, UK) was used to purge
carbon dioxide and water vapor. The spectra were recorded with a resolution
of 4 cm–1, with 512 interferograms to give the time
resolution of 3 min. OMNIC software (Thermo Nicolet Nexus, Madison,
WI, USA) was used for data acquisition and analysis. All experiments
were repeated in duplicate. Details concerning lipid monolayer preparation
and control with and without G4 peptide loaded and the
facilitation of ER-FTIR spectroscopy measurements are given in the Supporting Information.

4.4 NR
The NR measurements were carried
out using the FIGARO reflectometer at the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble,
France).41 The time-of-flight instrument
was used with a chopper pair, which gave a neutron wavelength range
between 2 and 30 Å and a dλ/λ of 7.0%. The data were
acquired at two incident angles of 0.62° and 3.8°, giving
a momentum transfer range (Qz) from about 0.005 to 0.4 Å–1. The instrument
was calibrated using a clean D2O subphase. The background
was subtracted using a 2D detector.

Given that NR is a nuclear
effect and that substituting hydrogen with deuterium alters the scattering
length, we can use H/D substitutions to obtain different reflectivity
profiles for the same system. Variation in the SLD (ρ) along
the surface normal determines the specular neutron reflectivity. In
our experiments we have used either D2O or NRW (containing
8.1 vol % D2O, with SLD = 0) as the subphase. For lipids,
H/D substitutions were applied to lipid tails. In the case of DPPG,
we used “cm” lipids, a mixture of hydrogenous and deuterated
lipids, to obtain an SLD of the tails matched to air or NRW, that
is, to make them effectively invisible to the measurement probe. After
peptide injection, the reflectivity was updated every 4 min at the
incident angle of 0.62° to follow peptide adsorption dynamics.
A dynamic low-Q analysis of the peptide–lipid
monolayer interaction was then used to follow the changes in the peptide
and lipid surface amounts over time until equilibration. A detailed
explanation of the low-Q analysis method has been
previously described.42 Following the measurements
of reflectivity profiles from hydrogenous and deuterated lipids in
NRW, before and after peptide addition, a single layer model in the
low Q range was applied by using a set of equations,
which combined hydrogenous and deuterated contrasts according to the
following relation 1  where τ is the thickness, NA is the Avogadro’s number, Γ is the surface
concentration, and b is the scattering lengths for
the lipid or peptide. As the low-Q region is insensitive
to the interfacial structure, the one-layer model enabled us to precisely
calculate the surface concentrations of both the lipid in the monolayer
and the peptide associated.

A full Q analysis
was subsequently performed to
resolve the structure of the interfacial layer. In this approach,
we used four isotopic contrasts: d- and h- (or cm) lipids on NRW and
D2O. The reflectivity profiles for each data set were then
simultaneously fitted using Motofit,43 based
on an optical matrix formalism44 to fit
Abeles layer models to the interfacial structure. The simplest model
(i.e., the least number of layers) which fits the data adequately
was chosen. For the lipid-only systems, a two-layer model was used,
with the top layer for the acyl chain region and the bottom for the
hydrated head groups. More details on the neutron data analysis can
be found in the Supporting Information.

After peptide addition, the equilibrium-adsorbed peptide–lipid
interfacial structure was fitted using either two- or three-layer
models. Because the peptide might become associated with the lipid
tail and head regions, we must calculate the amount of peptide associated
with each layer. This can be done by calculating the peptide volume
fraction (φpeptide) 2  where φlipid is the lipid
volume fraction (heads or tails), ρlipid represents
the calculated values of the SLD of the lipid molecules (heads or
tails), ρpeptide is the calculated SLD of the G4 peptide, and ρfit is the fitted SLD value
of the layer concerned. The total volume fraction for each layer of
lipid, peptide, and water components is equal to unity. A roughness
value of 1 Å was used to fit the interfaces of the lipid-only
layers, and a roughness value of 2 Å was used to fit those of
the layers containing the peptide. After calculating the surface concentrations
of each component of the system (using eqs S1 and S2), their area per molecule (A) can be
calculated using 3  

The SLD
values for the lipid and peptide components used in the
NR data analysis are summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The molecular volume and SLD values
of the peptide were calculated using Biomolecular SLD Calculator developed
by ISIS Neutron Facility (http://psldc.isis.rl.ac.uk/Psldc/).
