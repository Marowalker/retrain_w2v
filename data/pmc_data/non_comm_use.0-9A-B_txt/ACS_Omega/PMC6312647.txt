Zika
virus is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that causes devastating
fetal outcomes in the context of maternal infection during pregnancy.
An important target for drugs combatting Zika virus pathogenicity
is NS2B-NS3 protease, which plays an essential role in hydrolysis
and maturation of the flavivirus polyprotein. We identify hydroxychloroquine,
a drug that already has approved uses in pregnancy, as a possible
inhibitor of NS2B-NS3 protease by using a Food and Drug Administration-approved
drug library, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations.
Further, to gain insight into its inhibitory potential toward NS2B-NS3
protease, we performed enzyme kinetic studies, which revealed that
hydroxychloroquine inhibits protease activity with an inhibition constant
(Ki) of 92.34 ± 11.91 μM. Additionally,
hydroxychloroquine significantly decreases Zika virus infection in
placental cells.

==== Body
Introduction
Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs
to the Flavivirus genus
and is a member of the Flaviviridae family. Recent
research has revealed that ZIKV is associated with microcephaly in
fetuses1,2 and neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré
syndrome in adults.3−5 The rapid spread of this virus, affecting over a
million people6 across multiple continents,
has spurred researchers to search for effective therapeutic intervention.
A broad-spectrum antiviral agent against shared flavivirus proteins
would be especially attractive, given the preponderance of related
flavivirus infections (such as dengue and West Nile viruses) in areas
where ZIKV has been most prevalent.

Zika virus is an enveloped
virus like other flaviviruses, encapsulating
a single-stranded, positive-sense, RNA genome7 encoding a single polyprotein precursor.8 It is hydrolyzed into three structural proteins (E, prM/M, and C)
and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B,
and NS5)8−10 by the host and viral proteases.10 Among these viral and host elements, the viral NS2B-NS3
protease is an attractive drug target due to its essential role in
the virus life cycle. The crystal structure of NS2B-NS3 protease reveals
that NS2B (only the hydrophilic part was taken in the construct for
crystallographic studies, approximately residues 49–95 of the
full-length NS2B protein constituting ∼130 residues) can be
found in two conformations. In the presence of inhibitor/substrate,
NS2B forms a β-hairpin and lies near the substrate binding site
of NS3 protease, adopting a closed conformation, but in the absence
of inhibitor/substrate, it adopts an open conformation.11−14 The NS2B-NS3 protease structure with PDB ID: 5LC013 (hydrophilic part, residues 49–95 of NS2B fused
via a Gly4–Ser–Gly4 linker to the N-terminal of the
NS3 protease) shows NS2B wrapping around NS3 in such a way that the
C-terminal residues of NS2B form a β-hairpin that contributes
to the S2 pocket of the NS3 protease.13−15 As reported NS2B protein
has a high abundance of disorder promoting residues containing a 37-residue
disordered region (62–98).16,17 The NS2B interaction
with NS3 protease facilitates NS3-mediated cleavage of polyprotein
thus, it acts as an important cofactor for the activity of NS3 protease.18 Generally, disordered proteins lead to functionality
only upon interaction with its binding partner such as transactivation
domain of cMyb, in which cMyb becomes functional only upon binding
its ordered counterpart, KIX.19−22 Together, NS2B and NS3 form the NS2B-NS3 protease
complex that hydrolyzes the ZIKV polyprotein into functional proteins
used for viral propagation and maturation.11

Viral proteases are considered excellent targets for the identification
of potential drug candidates, as protease plays an indispensable role
in viral replication.23−25 Recently, the NS2B-NS3 protease has been investigated
as a target to identify potential inhibitors.26−29 Repurposing approved drugs can
be an efficient method to identify drug compounds, which may be capable
of activating or inhibiting new targets.30 This approach has several advantageous features, including reduced
development time and expense and improved safety.30 In our study, we screened Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved drugs for their ability to target NS2B-NS3 protease.
We hypothesize that specific drugs in the library will show potential
to specifically target NS2B-NS3 protease of ZIKV, especially given
that some drug compounds are already being used to target NS2B-NS3
protease in other flaviviruses.31−33 Here, we use molecular docking
and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies to identify potential
drug candidates from the library based on their predicted ability
to target the active site of NS2B-NS3 protease. Our top hits include
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), mitoxantrone, miglustat, nadolol, carteolol,
and pindolol. Among these potential candidates, hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ) was shown in a recent study to have an inhibitory effect on
ZIKV in a mouse model of ZIKV infection during pregnancy.34 Therefore, we pursued further studies with HCQ
and showed that HCQ likely targets the active site of NS2B-NS3 protease;
thus, it may block its ability to hydrolyze the single polypeptide
product of ZIKV into functional proteins required for ZIKV survival
and replication. Molecular dynamic simulation reveals a significant
gain in stability associated with the binding of HCQ to the protease
complex, suggesting a strong binding affinity between HCQ and the
active site of NS2B-NS3 protease. Further, inhibition assays support
the inhibition of NS2B-NS3 protease by HCQ. Finally, a recent study
from our group demonstrated that ZIKV infection activates the cellular
recycling pathway, autophagy, and that HCQ treatment blocks this activation,
leading to a reduction in ZIKV vertical transmission.34 Also, HCQ shows antiviral potential in the treatment of
dengue virus infection35 by activating
the innate immune signaling pathways and inducing the production of
reactive oxygen species. However, the molecular mechanism of action
of HCQ against ZIKV infection is still unclear. Our work, which describes
the interaction between HCQ and NS2B-NS3 protease in great detail,
may provide a foundation to leverage this compound and other derivatives
in treating patients infected with ZIKV.

Results
Virtual Screening
of FDA-Approved Drugs
To identify
drug candidates with the potential to inhibit NS2B-NS3 protease, we
performed structure-based virtual screening employing in silico molecular
docking techniques. An X-ray crystal structure of ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease
(PDB ID: 5LC0) was utilized as an input in the docking process. Since
the dipeptide boronic acid acts as an inhibitor of the protease complex
as reported previously,13 we utilized the
same binding site as the active site of NS2B-NS3 protease for docking.
After extra precision (XP) docking, the top 25 compounds were selected
to go through induced fit docking (IFD) protocol. This docking protocol
considers the movement of highly flexible residues of the NS2B-NS3
protease complex upon binding of a drug compound at the active site.
The IFD scores of top six compounds, viz., mitoxantrone, hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ), miglustat, nadolol, carteolol, and pindolol, with NS2B-NS3
protease are shown in Tables 1 and S1. Mitoxantrone and HCQ are
associated with the highest docking scores of −12.785 and −10.725
kcal/mol, respectively (Table 1), indicating that they have high potential to bind to NS2B-NS3
protease and to fit in the active site pocket. Both these compounds,
along with miglustat, nadolol, carteolol, and pindolol, were stabilized
at the NS2B-NS3 protease active site by interactions with key amino
acid residues through H-bonds, pi interactions, and salt bridges (Table S1).

to NS2B cofactor.

IFD revealed
that mitoxantrone was associated with the highest
docking score. Mitoxantrone has a molecular weight (MW) of 444.5 g/mol,
and its interaction with the active site of NS2B-NS3 protease is established
by H-bonds (Ser81 and Phe84 of NS2B; Asp75 and Pro131 of NS3 protease),
pi–pi interaction (Tyr161 of NS3 protease), a pi–cation
interaction (Tyr161 of NS3 protease), salt bridges (Asp129 and Asp175
of NS3 protease), and hydrophobic interactions (Trp50, Val72, Tyr130,
Ala132, Tyr150, Val154, and Val155 of NS3 protease) (Figures S1A and S2A).

Interactions between HCQ (MW:
335.9 g/mol), the second highest-scoring
compound, and protease include H-bonds involving NS2B (Asp83) and
NS3 protease (Tyr130, Gly151, and Asn152). HCQ also forms a salt bridge
(Asp129 of NS3 protease) and pi interactions (pi–pi and pi–cation
interactions with Tyr161 of NS3 protease). Besides, some hydrophobic
amino acid residues (Phe84 of NS2B and Pro131, Ala132, Tyr150, and
Val155 of NS3 protease) contribute to the interaction between HCQ
and the active site of NS2B-NS3 protease (Figure 1). The binding pose of mitoxantrone and HCQ
show that the NS3 component of the protease complex has a higher number
of interacting amino acid residues than the NS2B cofactor does.

residues that belong to NS2B; B: residues 49–87 of NS2B are
denoted 49–87, while residues 15–167 of NS3 protease
are denoted 1015–1167].

The third-ranking molecule, miglustat (MW: 219.3 g/mol),
interacts
with NS3 protease using two H-bonds (Tyr130 and Ser135), one pi–pi
interaction (Tyr161), and one salt bridge (Ser135). The interaction
between miglustat and NS2B-NS3 protease is also established through
hydrophobic residues (Leu128, Pro131, Ala132, Tyr150, and Val162)
of NS3 protease (Figures S1B and S2B).

The fourth-ranking molecule is nadolol, (MW: 309.4 g/mol), which
interacts with NS2B through one H-bond (Asp83) and NS3 protease by
five H-bonds (Tyr130, Ser135, Asn152, Gly153, and Tyr161) and two
pi interactions (pi–cation at Hie51 and pi–pi at Tyr161).
Nadolol is also stabilized at the active site of NS2B-NS3 protease
by hydrophobic residues of NS2B and NS3 protease (Pro131, Ala132,
Tyr150, Val154, and Val155 of NS3 protease and Phe84 of NS2B) (Figures S1C and S2C).

Carteolol (MW: 292.4
g/mol), the fifth-ranking drug compound, interacts
with NS3 protease through four H-bonds (Asp75, Asn152, Tyr161, and
Tyr130), two pi interactions (pi–pi at Tyr161 and pi–cation
at Hie51), and a salt bridge (Asp75) (Figures S1D and S2D). Pindolol (MW: 248.3 g/mol), the sixth-ranking
drug compound, shows interactions with NS3 protease by means of four
H-bonds (Tyr130, Asn152, Gly153, and Tyr161) and one pi–pi
interaction (Tyr161) (Figures S1E and S2E). The interactions of both carteolol and pindolol with the active
site are also established through hydrophobic residues of NS2B (Phe84)
and NS3 protease (Pro131, Ala132, Tyr150, and Val155).

Molecular Dynamics
Simulation
To better understand
the stability of their binding interactions with NS2B-NS3 protease,
we subjected these top-scoring six compounds to molecular dynamics
simulation in order to monitor the conformational changes and dynamic
behavior of protein over the course of a 30 000 ps time period.
Changes in the structural integrity of the protease complex were analyzed
by calculating the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and the root-mean-square
fluctuations (RMSFs) over the backbone atoms of NS2B-NS3 protease,
which includes a series of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. The RMSD
plot revealed that the compound HCQ (Figure 2A) and mitoxantrone (Figure S3A) demonstrate greatest stability at approximately
1.5–1.8 Å, indicating that the interaction between HCQ
and the active site of the protease is stable throughout the simulation
period of 30 000 ps. The other compounds were observed to have
stability around RMSD of 1.5–2 Å over the simulation time
period (Figure S3). The root-mean-square
fluctuations (RMSFs) illustrate the distinction between the NS2B and
NS3 components of the ZIKV protease (Figures 2 and S3).

stability around 1.5–1.8 Å throughout the simulation period.

NS2B-NS3 protease; ps: picosecond; residues 49–87 of NS2B are
denoted 49–87, while residues 15–167 of NS3 protease
are denoted 1015–1167].

HCQ (Figure 2B)
and mitoxantrone (Figure S3B) exhibit the
least fluctuation and are associated with the greatest gain in stability
upon binding to NS2B-NS3 protease. Similar RMSFs are observed at residues
50–100 of the NS3 protease in the case of all of the compounds,
and this may be due to a change in the interacting residues. Further,
the radius of gyration (Figure 2C) reveals that bound HCQ maintains compactness during the
simulation period. The complex does not lose hydrogen bonds during
the simulation period. HCQ (Figure 2D) and mitoxantrone (Figure S3D) show no loss of hydrogen bonds throughout the simulation, and the
H-bond interactions were maintained during the simulation period.
Overall, the drug–protease complexes show significant stability
throughout the simulation, but compared to other compounds, HCQ and
mitoxantrone show the greatest stability over the 30 000 ps
time scale.

HCQ Inhibits NS2B-NS3 Protease Activity
Among the top-hit
compounds, we selected HCQ, an antimalarial agent that is considered
an FDA Pregnancy Class C drug, for further investigation. HCQ is also
utilized as a chronic suppressive treatment for rheumatological diseases,
such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Importantly, women
taking HCQ for SLE are recommended to continue their HCQ regimen throughout
pregnancy, and several studies illustrate the relative safety of using
this drug during pregnancy, for both the mother and the developing
fetus.36−38 A recent report on ZIKV transmission in pregnant
mice revealed that HCQ successfully inhibits maternal–fetal
transmission due to modulation of the autophagy pathway in the placenta.34 HCQ also acts as a potential inhibitor of dengue
virus infection by activating the innate immune signaling pathway.35 With these features in mind, HCQ was considered
to be a prime candidate for further experiments. Therefore, we pursued
further studies with HCQ and showed that HCQ likely targets the active
site of NS2B-NS3 protease. The kinetic parameters (Km, kcat, and kcat/Km) of active NS2B-NS3
protease were obtained using the Michaelis–Menten equation,
which showed Km, kcat, and kcat/Km to be 13.14 ± 1.702 μM, 0.9682 ± 0.0345
min–1, and 0.0737 ± 0.00989 min–1 μM–1, respectively (Figure 3A, B). To demonstrate the inhibitory potential
of the drug against NS2B-NS3 protease, we computed kinetic parameters
in the presence of HCQ (Figure 3C, D). Using the substrate–velocity curves, we determined
the inhibition constant (Ki) of HCQ to
be 92.34 ± 11.91 μM.

kinetic curves. LB plot in (D) represents the fitting of the data
through competitive inhibition.

HCQ Inhibits ZIKV Burden in Placental Trophoblast Cells
Given that ZIKV is transmitted from mother to the developing fetus
in a transplacental manner by damaging and killing placental cells
(trophoblasts), we tested the ability of HCQ to block ZIKV activity
in a placental trophoblast cell line, JEG3. A dose curve of HCQ (0–80
μM) was performed (data not shown). JEG3 cells were infected
for 48 h with ZIKV and treated with 80 μM HCQ, which led to
a highly significant reduction in ZIKV titers (Figure 4A). Next, we examined the localization of
the inhibitory activity of HCQ. Immunofluorescence analysis of ZIKV-infected
trophoblasts reveals that the virus can be found in large foci of
cells and that HCQ treatment reduces the number of foci as well as
the size of the foci of infected cells (Figure 4B).

cells. (A)

Discussion
The
rapid spread of ZIKV infection, its association with microcephaly
and neurological disorders,1−4 and its capacity for human-to-human transmission39,40 have produced an urgent need for an effective drug against ZIKV.
In the area of drug discovery, repurposing is an efficient approach
to screen drug molecules from an existing drug library for successful
inhibition of a new target,30 and in silico
drug modeling is a useful and cost-effective strategy to identify
drug candidates in a short period. Viral proteases are considered
excellent targets for the identification of potential drug candidates,
as protease plays an indispensable role in viral replication.23−25 This has been the case in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) research,
which has developed several drugs with the ability to inhibit the
HIV protease.41,42 Recently, NS2B-NS3 protease has
been investigated as a target to identify potential inhibitors against
other flaviviruses.26−28,43−45 In our study, we have used ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease as a target as
it plays a key role in processing a single polyprotein precursor into
functional proteins. Therefore, NS2B-NS3 protease is an attractive
target for identifying potential drug candidates against ZIKV.46,47

A previous report showed significant inhibition of the ZIKV
NS2B-NS3
protease by dipeptide boronic acid;13 hence,
the same active site can be utilized to broaden drug discovery research
to develop new therapeutic interventions. To explore potential new
inhibitors of the ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease, we employed molecular docking
and molecular dynamics simulation studies of FDA-approved drug molecules.
Among the top hit, we selected HCQ, an antimalarial and antirheumatic
agent that is considered an FDA Pregnancy Class C drug, for further
investigation. We identify a possible interaction of HCQ with the
NS2B-NS3 protease, where the interactions of certain key amino acid
residues of NS2B and NS3 protease are required to stabilize HCQ at
the binding site. Molecular docking reveals that HCQ exhibits considerable
affinity for the NS2B-NS3 protease active site. Also, refinement in
the binding affinity through induced fit docking confirms strong binding
of HCQ to NS2B-NS3 protease. The binding and stabilization of HCQ
at the active site of NS2B-NS3 protease requires the formation of
an H-bond with Asp83 of NS2B and Gly151 of NS3 protease, a pi interaction
at Tyr161, and a salt bridge at Asp129 of NS3 protease. A similar
mode of interaction has been seen in the NS2B-NS3 protease of Zika
virus, where the substrate interacts through Asp129, Gly151, and Tyr161
of NS3 protease and Asp83 of NS2B.48 Also,
there are some reports on the NS2B-NS3 protease of Zika virus and
West Nile virus, which demonstrated that a dipeptide boronic acid
compound (cn-716) acts as a reversible inhibitor of the NS2B-NS3 protease
complex.13,49 In the case of Zika virus protease complex,
arginine of cn-716 forms a salt bridge with Asp129 residue of the
NS3 protease, and this feature is conserved in other flavivirus protease
complexes. A similar kind of interaction has also been seen in the
crystal structure of West Nile virus NS3 protease complexed with an
inhibitor.50,51 This interaction provides a basis
for the strong binding hypothesized between HCQ and the active site
of NS2B-NS3 protease. Also, our molecular dynamics simulation result
shows the stabilization of the HCQ at the active site of NS2B-NS3
protease throughout simulation period. Further, enzyme inhibition
kinetics suggest that HCQ significantly inhibits the activity of NS2B-NS3
protease (Ki = 92.34 ± 11.91 μM).
Here, we show that HCQ blocks ZIKV protease activity. On the basis
of the previous report on chloroquine inhibiting proteolytic processing
of prM to M protein,52 we do not rule out
the possibility of other targets of HCQ in Zika virus, but these need
to be further explored. Previous studies documented the antiviral
properties of chloroquine and HCQ. They suggested that chloroquine
inhibits the early and late stages of viral replication, but the antiviral
effect of the drug is increased when added before infection compared
to post infection.53 From these studies,
it is clear that at early stages of viral replication, chloroquine
acts as an entry inhibitor. In our studies, we treated the trophoblast
cells with HCQ 3 h post infection (hpi); therefore, reduced viral
burden may have resulted due to inhibition of late-stage viral replication
such as the inhibition of viral particle maturation. HCQ may be inhibiting
the maturation of polyprotein by blocking NS2B-NS3 protease activity.
Since NS2B-NS3 protease plays an important role in the proteolytic
processing of ZIKV polyprotein, we can hypothesize that blocking protease
activity with HCQ will inhibit polyprotein processing and subsequent
viral assembly and maturation. In our recent report on ZIKV transmission
in pregnant mice, we revealed that HCQ successfully inhibits maternal–fetal
transmission due to modulation of the autophagy pathway in the placenta.34 Our study demonstrates that HCQ can additionally
inhibit ZIKV infection of placental trophoblasts possibly due to its
binding affinity to the ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease.

The five other
top-ranked compounds, viz., mitoxantrone, miglustat,
nadolol, carteolol, and pindolol, form stable interactions with the
amino acid residues of NS2B and NS3 protease at the active site. The
residues Asp129, Ser135, Gly153, and Tyr161 of NS3 protease and Asp83
of NS2B are involved in establishing the HCQ interaction, demonstrating
a similar mode of interaction between substrate/inhibitor as seen
in other flavivirus proteases.50,51,54 In summary, various amino acid residues are involved in stabilizing
drug molecules at the active site of the NS2B-NS3 protease of Zika
virus. Further studies will test the other top compounds for their
inhibitory effect against Zika virus.

Methods
System Configuration
Molecular docking and molecular
dynamics simulation studies were executed using a high-performance
GPU operated with CentOS V6.6 Linux operating platform and with hardware
configuration of the HPC GPU Super Micro Intel Xeon E5-620 v3 series
with 8-core processor, 64 GB DDR4-2133 ECC RDIMM of RAM, and graphics
card of NvidiaQuadroK2000 with 2 GB. The software specifications we
used for docking and molecular dynamics simulation are the commercial
version of Schrödinger software package, LLC, NY 2012, and
the all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS-AA)
force field academic-licensed molecular dynamics package of Desmond4.4.

Structure-Based Virtual Screening
The X-ray crystal
structure of the NS2B-NS3 protease (PDB ID: 5LC0) was retrieved from
the Protein Data Bank. The crystal structure of NS2B-NS3 protease
(dimer form, chains A and B) is crystallized with dipeptide boronic
acid (cn-716; ID: 6T8), where each monomer contains a cn-716. The
dipeptide boronic acid acts as an inhibitor, embedded at the substrate
binding site of the protease. Each monomeric unit comprises a C-terminal
fragment of NS2B (hydrophilic residues 49–95), fused via a
linker (Gly)4–Ser–(Gly)4 with
the N-terminus of NS3.13 The NS2B-NS3 protease
monomer was prepared using the Schrödinger suite protein preparation
wizard, which has two main functions: preparation and refinement.
These features of the preparation wizard perform various tasks, viz.,
assigning a bond order, adding hydrogen, creating zero-order bonds
to metals, creating disulfide bonds, filling in missing side chains,
and removing water molecules beyond 5 Å. Further structural optimization
was done at pH 7, and water molecules with fewer than three H-bonds
were removed. The embedded dipeptide boronic acid compound has been
used as a model to investigate catalytic drug binding. This site was
chosen as a prerequisite for receptor grid generation to protease
using the Grid generation panel of the Schrödinger suite Glide
Module. We used boronate inhibitor as a reference to create the size
of the grid (X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates as 81.82, 51.89, and 153.80 Å, respectively),
where the incoming ligand binds during the docking process. Receptor
grid scaling of van der Waals radii of receptor atoms was done with
a scaling factor of one unit and a partial charge cutoff of 0.25 to
soften the potential of nonpolar parts of the receptor. The FDA-approved
drug compounds were prepared using the Schrödinger suite Ligand
Prep module before they underwent ligand docking. This drug library,
consisting of 1861 compounds, was selected from the DrugBank database.55 The Ligand Prep module is able to generate different
structures of compounds based on stereoisomers, ring conformations,
and ionization states for each processed compound. Ligand preparation
of 1861 drug compounds produced 5323 structures that were processed
through the Lipinski filter (retaining structures with molecular weights
≤500 g/mol to make the screening more effective and to retrieve
the compounds that satisfy all conditions of filtration) and a reactive
filter. Out of 5323 structures, 2558 passed through the Lipinski and
reactive filters. To screen a potential candidate for inhibition,
FDA-approved drugs were processed using a Glide program. These drug
compounds were docked at the active site of NS2B-NS3 protease and
filtered using high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS), standard
precision (SP), and extra precision (XP) docking. First, we performed
high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS), which rapidly identified
the top 40% of input compounds based on docking score. These selected
molecules then underwent standard precision (SP) docking at the same
active site on the protease, again eliminating all but the top 40%
of input compounds. The next phase, extra precision (XP) docking,
selected only the top 10% of the input compounds.

the binding between protease and drug compounds more accurately, we
employed induced fit docking (IFD). IFD accurately predicts binding
poses of ligands to their receptors and occurrences of structural
changes at the receptor during ligand binding. It involves the Glide
module and Prime module to predict accurate binding, considering the
flexibility of both the ligand and receptor.56 We used a standard protocol that generates up to 20 poses using
automatic docking settings. It utilizes a receptor van der Waals scaling
of 0.50 and a ligand van der Waals scaling of 0.05, and it penalizes
nonpolar conformations for amide bonds and sample ring conformations
with 2.5 kcal/mol energy windows. Further refinement was done for
residues within 5 Å of ligand poses. Glide redocking into structures
within 30 kcal/mol of the best structure and within the top 20 structures
overall was performed with XP precision. Among different poses and
conformations, the best one was selected based on docking score.

Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation
The NS2B-NS3 protease−ligand
complex was subjected to a 30 ns molecular dynamics simulation to
further evaluate their stability. The intramolecular conformational
changes that occur in the protein structure have been well explained
by molecular dynamics simulation studies.57 Molecular dynamics of the NS2B-NS3 protease–FDA drug complexes
were simulated using the Desmond module of Schrödinger package.58 The docking score and the interaction analysis
were used to select compounds that would be carried forward to the
energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation studies with
the OPLS-AA force field.59 An orthorhombic
water box was created using the Desmond system builder, and preequilibrated
TIP3P water molecules and 0.15 M Na + Cl– were placed
in the system as neutralizing compounds.60 A distance of greater than 5 Å was maintained between the box
wall and protein, thereby ensuring that the protein could not directly
interact with its own periodic image. Energy minimization of the protein
complex in the prepared system for MD simulation was carried out to
a maximum of 3000 steps using the steepest descent until a gradient
threshold (25 kcal/(mol Å)) was reached. The periodic boundary
conditions were applied, and the long-range electrostatic interactions
were treated with Ewald sums.61 The molecular
dynamics simulation was performed at a constant temperature of 300
K and a pressure of 1.01 bar with a time interval of 2 fs.62,63 A cutoff radius of 9 Å was selected for the coulombic short-range
interaction cutoff method. At every 4.8 ps, the frames of the trajectory
were captured. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and root-mean-square
fluctuation (RMSF) of the backbone were obtained through the simulation
using the first frames as a reference.61

Gene Construct and Protein Purification
We chose an
expression plasmid vector, pET151/D-T, to insert a DNA fragment encoding
NS2B-NS3 protease of ZIKV. An Escherichia coli codon-optimized DNA sequence encoding NS2B-NS3 protease (amino acid
sequence taken from NS2B-NS3 protease structure 5LC0 from the Protein
Data Bank) was inserted in the vector in-frame with 6XHis tag and
TEV cleavage site (synthesized by Invitrogen). Restriction enzymes XhoI and NdeI were used to insert the gene
of interest into the vector. The NS2B-NS3 protease gene (with tag,
i.e., 6Xhis-V5 epitope–TEV cleavage site) is composed of 263
residues, and it has a molecular weight and a theoretical isoelectric
point of 27.99 kDa and 5.40, respectively, as determined by the ExPASy
ProtParam tool. This recombinant plasmid encodes a polypeptide whose
sequence from N- to C-terminus reads: 6Xhis-V5 epitope–TEV
cleavage site–NS2B-NS3 protease gene. Transformation of recombinant
plasmid was done in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells, and cells positive for the recombinant plasmid were used
to express NS2B-NS3 protease (in LB media and 0.5 mM IPTG at 20 °C
for 16 h). The cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 10
min) at 4 °C. Afterward, cell lysis was done using B-PER (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM) at 4 °C
(30 min incubation). The NS2B-NS3 protease was purified from the soluble
fraction through HisPur Cobalt Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using
Tris–HCl binding buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl, 300 mM NaCl,
40 mM imidazole, and 10% glycerol, pH 8.5) and elution buffer (25
mM Tris–HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, and 10% glycerol,
pH 8.5). Next, the tag of the purified NS2B-NS3 protease was removed
by tobacco etch virus protease (AcTEV, Invitrogen) while incubating
at 25 °C for 4.5 h. Hydrolysis by AcTEV produced a polypeptide
of 236 residues (24.837 kDa), where 230 residues are from the NS2B-NS3
protease reported as 5LC0,13 and the remaining
six residues (at the N-terminus of the polypeptide) are Gly–Ile–Asp–Pro–Phe–Thr.
The cleaved NS2B-NS3 protease was purified through HisPur Cobalt Resin
using 25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.5 containing 10% glycerol. The purity
of NS2B-NS3 protease (uncleaved and cleaved) was analyzed with sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%).

Activity Assay
Enzyme kinetics of the NS2B-NS3 protease
was determined in a reaction buffer containing 10 mM phosphate, 1
mM TCEP, 1 mM CHAPS, and 20% glycerol, pH 7 and 30 °C. In a 96-well
black plate, the substrate, benzoyl–norleucine–lysine–lysine–arginine–7-amino-4-methylcoumarin
(benzoyl–Nle–KKR–AMC; Sigma-Aldrich: 98.6% purity;
stock preparation: in water), was serially diluted in reaction buffer
(10 mM phosphate buffer, 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM CHAPS, and 20% glycerol;
pH 7) to achieve a concentration range of 1.56–200 μM.
Afterward, NS2B-NS3 protease was added into the wells to a 5 nM final
concentration. The fluorescence signal of released AMC was monitored
with an emission wavelength of 460 nm at 360 nm excitation using a
multiplate reader (infiniteM200PRO: TECAN), while gain was adjusted
manually to 80. The amount of released AMC at varying substrate concentrations
was determined via a standard curve of fluorescence signal produced
as a function of free AMC (concentration range: 0.025–12.8
μM; stock: 50 mM in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide). Further, the initial
velocity of the reaction was calculated in terms of the amount of
AMC produced per minute during 15 min. The data were fitted to the
Michaelis–Menten equation, V = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S]), to determine enzyme kinetic parameters
(Km, kcat,
and Vmax) using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software.
Measurement of data points was taken in triplicates, and data were
represented as a mean ± standard error with R2 = 0.95.

Inhibition Assay
For inhibition
studies, to determine
the enzyme kinetic parameters, we used the same reaction buffer and
substrate as we used to determine the activity of the NS2B-NS3 protease.
HCQ (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in water to prepare 50 mM stock
solutions, which were serially diluted in reaction buffer to make
a variable range of concentrations (0, 12.5, 25, 100, and 200 μM).
Subsequently, NS2B-NS3 protease (5 nM final concentration for 50 μl
reaction volume) was mixed with different concentrations of HCQ and
incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Afterward, the reaction was initiated
by adding 25 μl of substrate (to final substrate concentrations
of 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μM). The fluorescence
signal was monitored at 460 nm emission and 360 nm excitation wavelength
at every 5 min of interval. Further, the Ki was computed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software at 15 min. Experiments
were set up in triplicate, and values were represented as a mean ±
standard error with R2 = 0.95.

ZIKV Infection
and Measurement of Viral Burden in Vitro
The Brazilian strain
of ZIKV (Paraiba 2015) was used in this study.64 Studies with ZIKV were conducted under biosafety
level 2 (BSL2). JEG3, a human cytotrophoblast cell line from the ATCC
(HTB-36), was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
at 37 °C with 5% CO2. JEG3 cells were infected with
ZIKV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 for 3 h, washed twice with
warm phosphate-buffered saline, and then cultured in fresh media containing
0 or 80 μM hydroxychloroquine (Sigma-Aldrich). At 48 h post
infection (hpi), the cells were harvested for the measurement of viral
burden or were fixed for immunofluorescence using a ZIKV-specific
mAb, ZV-2, as previously described.64 After
48 h, supernatants were harvested for RNA extraction using the Viral
RNA Mini kit (Qiagen). ZIKV RNA levels were determined by one-step
quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on an
ABI 7500 Fast Instrument using standard cycling conditions. Viral
burden from supernatant samples was expressed on a log10 scale as viral RNA equivalents per mL after comparison with a standard
curve produced using serial 10-fold dilutions of ZIKV RNA. A published
primer set was used to detect ZIKV RNA:65 Fwd, 5′-CCGCTGCCCAACACAAG-3′; Rev, 5′-CCACTAACGTTCTTTTGCAGACAT-3′;
Probe, 5′-/56-FAM/AGCCTACCT/ZEN/TGACAAGCAATCAGACACTCAA/3IABkFQ/-3′
(Integrated DNA Technologies).

For immunofluorescence studies,
the cells were grown on Millicell EZ slides (Millipore Sigma), fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X. After
blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated overnight
with primary antibodies to the E protein of ZIKV,64 followed by fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM880
Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope with Airyscan. Images were processed
and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop and NIH Image J software.

GraphPad Prism 5.0 was used for all cell culture-related analyses.
The analyses of virologic data were conducted using a Mann–Whitney
test. Data with p-values <0.05 were considered
to be statistically significant.
