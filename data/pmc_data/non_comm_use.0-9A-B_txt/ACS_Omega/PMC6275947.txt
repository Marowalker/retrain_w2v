We show that micron-scale two-dimensional
(2D) honeycomb microwells
can significantly improve the stability of blue phase liquid crystals
(BPLCs). Polymeric microwells made by direct laser writing improve
various features of the blue phase (BP) including a dramatic extension
of stable temperature range and a large increase both in reflectivity
and thermal stability of the reflective peak wavelength. These results
are mainly attributed to the omnidirectional anchoring of the isotropically
oriented BP molecules at the polymer walls of the hexagonal microwells
and at the top and bottom substrates. This leads to an omnidirectional
stabilization of the entire BPLC system. This study not only provides
a novel insight into the mechanism for the BP formation in the 2D
microwell but also points to an improved route to stabilize BP using
2D microwell arrays.

Introduction
Photonic crystals (PCs)
form naturally through self-ordering of
spherical particles to create the iridescent colors in gem stones
such as opal,1 whereas the dynamic light
manipulation properties of PCs are clearly seen in nature, for instance,
in the vivid displays of cuttlefish.2 Hence,
the engineering of three-dimensional (3D) materials capable of actively
manipulating light for novel functional devices has attracted much
attention. Self-assembly methods have been pursued as an approach
to engineer these PCs initially using soft matter materials, such
as colloidal particles3 using hard sphere
packing4,5 and electrostatic repulsion6 even achieving dynamic control through electric fields.7 More recently polymers8 and liquid crystals (LCs)9 have been
shown to self-organize into wavelength scale structures. In fact,
a broad range of LCs with chirality possess a periodic structure and
exhibit strong wavelength and polarisation-dependent scattering including
chiral nematic phase (N*) or cholesteric LC (CLC) and blue phase (BP).
The BP is a mesophase between isotropic and chiral nematic phase,
where first the LC molecules self-assemble into double-twisted cylinders
(DTCs) with disclinations among adjacent DTCs, and then second these
cylinders stack into woodpile-like structures with period of the order
of the visible wavelength. By virtue of the adjustable periodicity
and the specific chirality for a BP structure, a tunable photonic
band gap (PBG) for circular polarizations with handedness the same
as that of the helix of the DTCs10 is formed.
This tunable PBG and its exceptional properties (e.g., submillisecond
response time) open opportunities for the BP to have application in
advanced photonic devices exploiting their 3D PC properties.11 However, BP usually exists in a very narrow
temperature range (a few degrees) because the formation of double-twisted
helical structure is energetically unfavorable and critical.12 To overcome this significant disadvantage, various
techniques, such as polymer stabilization,13 nanoparticle doping,14−16 photosensitive chiral doping,17 and molecular modification,18 have been proposed for stabilizing the BP structure and widening
its stable temperature range. The most common method to widen the
temperature range of BP is polymer stabilization. It has recently
been reported that polymer-stabilized BP can exhibit a wide temperature
range of more than 95 °C, leading to display applications.19

In this paper, we study the optical features
and dynamic growth
of the BP within a honeycomb microwell structure. Experimental results
indicate that the BPs enclosed in the micro-honeycomb structure are
significantly more stable than those out of the microwells. The BP
temperature range on cooling in the microwell is dramatically increased
(approximately fourfold) compared to BP outside the microwells. Additionally,
the thermal stability of the peak wavelength and the reflectivity
for the PBG in the microwell are both much improved. The results are
attributable to the omnidirectional anchoring forces provided by the
polymer walls of the microwell, and the sample substrates prevent
the secondary logpile structure from dispersing once it has been formed,
resulting in the significant improvement of optical features of the
BP. This study not only provides a novel insight into the mechanism
for the retention of BPs in two-dimensional (2D) microstructures but
also demonstrates a new approach of developing a stabilized BP device
for use in display devices or as an optical modulator.

Results and Discussion
A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) top-view image of the honeycomb
microstructure is shown in Figure 1. The minimum wall thickness and height are 5.4 and
6.4 μm, respectively, as shown in the inset of Figure 1. Each microwell cell in the
honeycomb microstructure has a maximum inner width of around 20 μm. Figure 1b shows the microscopic
2D image of the fabricated honeycomb microwell array. For identification
of hexagonal cells in the microstructure array, each cell is numbered
as Area 1 to Area 25, whereas the area out of the microstructures
is labeled Area 26, as shown in Figure 1b.

Figure 1 (a) SEM image of the micro-honeycomb structures fabricated
using
TPP lithography. The minimum wall thickness is 5.4 μm (inset,
scale bar, 2 μm), and the aspect ratio is 1.19 (height to wall
thickness). The scale bar is 10 μm. (b) Microscopic image of
the microstructure and the labeled areas, Area 1 to Area 25 in the
microwells and Area 26 out of the micro-honeycomb structure. The scale
bar is 20 μm.

After drop-casting the
BP mixture on the microstructure substrate
and enclosing it by directly placing a cover slip on the top of the
substrate, the obtained BP-filled microstructure sample is observed
by using a home-made transmission-type polarizing optical microscope
equipped with crossed polarizers and a hot stage (LTS120, Linkam)
and a temperature controller (T96, Linkam). The transmission-type,
rather than reflection-type, POM is selected herein for the identification
of the existence of BPs in the microwell cells. The colorful BP image
can be easily observed through the transmission-type POM with crossed
polarizers because the transmitted light with a certain color will
dominantly leak through the optical activity of the BP and then the
analyzer. In contrast the use of the reflection-type POM cannot assure
the existence of BP if the reflection planes of the BP crystals are
oblique relative to the observation direction. The sample was heated
to 53 °C, which is above the clear point of the BP mixture, and
then slowly cooled down at a rate of 0.1 °C min–1. The POM images of the sample observed at different temperatures
are shown in Figure 2. When the temperature is higher than 49 °C, the BP material
is isotropic and thus only the microstructure can be seen under the
POM with crossed polarizers (the image of an isotropic medium should
be completely dark under the POM with crossed polarizers, but the
exposure time of the camera was extended deliberately for clear observation).
The crystallization of BP begins to appear in the region out of the
microstructures at 48 °C, but at the same time only few areas
in the microstructure exhibit BP. However, crystallized regions grow
across all areas both inside and outside the microstructures until
all the observed regions in the microstructure are full of BP when
the temperature reaches 46 °C. As the temperature falls to 44
°C, the LC outside of the microstructures (Area 26) begins to
transition from BP to focal conic CLC, which appears as scattered
white-yellow, whereas all areas inside the microstructure (Area 1
to Area 25) remain in the BP state until 38 °C. Below 38 °C,
the LCs in more and more areas of the microstructure change from BP
to focal conic texture; however, some survive down to 23 °C,
where there are still four areas (Areas 1, 3, 6, and 19) where the
LC remains in the BP state. When the temperature is cooled to 18.4
°C, the LCs in all areas of the microstructure transit to the
focal conic state. The whole cooling process is recorded as Movie S1 in the Supporting Information.

POM images of the BP sample with the honeycomb
microwell structure at decreasing temperatures from 49 to 23 °C.
The polarizer and analyzer in the POM are set as crossed.

The experimental results in the first-round cooling
process in Figure 2 were used to calculate
the variations in the BP temperature range and displayed in Figure 3a. We see random
variations in the BP temperature range in different areas of the microstructure.
To investigate if this is truly random or associated with specific
microwells, we repeat the abovementioned cooling process. The associated
experimental results of the second round are summarized in Figure 3b. By comparing results
in Figure 3a,b, we
see that there are random fluctuations in the temperature range of
the BP in the microstructure but the enhancement of range is largely
independent of the microwell number. The average temperature range
of the BP in the microstructure is about 21 °C which is about
four times of that outside of the microstructure in area 26 which
is around 5 °C. We propose two main reasons for the different
temperature range of BP in different areas. The primary reason is
likely to be the slight variation in boundary conditions including
the surface conditions of the substrates and the polymer wall of the
microwells. A secondary reason might be slight variation of temperature
across the sample. The extension of BP temperature range in each area
is repeatable qualitatively but not quantitatively. As shown in Figure 3, the thermal properties
of the BP are independent of the position of the microwells. Only
one well, well 15, produces a consistently lower extension and even
then it is twice the stability width of Area 26. We suspect there
may be a small fabrication fault in well 15. A similar experiment
with reduced honeycomb size with a unit cell of 10 μm width
was performed, and the temperature range of BP in the microwells was
also wider than that outside the microwells. We have not tried larger
structures but expect to lose the effect if the unit cell is too large.

range measured in all areas of the microstructure
(Area 1 to Area 25). Area 26 is the area out of the microstructure.
(a) First-round and (b) second-round cooling processes.

To compare the photonic properties of the BP inside
and outside
of the microstructures at different temperatures, we further measured
the reflection spectra of four selected areas, three inside, in areas
2, 9, and 13, and the other outside in area 26. These are measured
at a range of temperature during the slow cooling process (0.1 °C
min–1) and the associated data are summarized in Figure 4a–d, respectively.
We have preconfirmed that the relation between the optical properties
of the BP with the temperature outside the microwells (Area 26) is
identical to those of the BP sample without microstructure. The horizontal
and perpendicular axes in the figures represent the temperature and
wavelength, respectively, and the color bar from blue to red represents
the reflectance of 0–50% in each measured reflection spectrum.
The reflection colors of the BPs are determined by the reflecting
lattice plane of the crystal, the lattice constant, and the plane
normal relative to the observer. In this paper, the reflections at
a central wavelength of ∼550 nm from the crystal plane of (110)
in the BPI crystal structure were measured. However, the other (200)
and (211) planes leading to reflections at 389 and 318 nm have not
yet been investigated. This is due to the fact that shorter wavelengths
are out of the measurable range of the spectrometer. Other areas in
the microwells show similar reflective properties to those shown in
Areas 2, 9, and 13. The temperature-dependent Bragg reflection of
the BP out of the microwells is shown in Figure 4d.

Figure 4 Temperature-dependent reflection spectra of
the BP in (a) Area
9, (b) Area 2, (c) Area 13, and (d) Area 26 in and out of the honeycomb
microwells, respectively.

This result highlights the differences between the temperature-dependent
photonic structures in the two areas, when we consider temperature
range, reflectance, and the peak wavelength for the reflection band
of the BP. First, as expected we see the temperature range of the
BP (ΔTBP) in Areas 2, 9, and 13
of the microwells is considerably wider than that in Area 26. The
isotropic–BP transition temperatures (TI–BP) measured in both areas are similar (between 48
and 49 °C) but the BP–CLC transition temperatures (TBP–CLC) measured in Areas 2, 9, 13 and
26 are, respectively, approximately 28, 24, 26, and 42 °C. That
is, the temperature range to sustain in the BP state in Area 9 is
about 4 times wider than that in Area 26 consistent with the results
shown in Figures 2 and 3. The result shows that the LCs tend to remain in
the BP state rather than reverting to the focal conic state under
the influence of the microstructure during cooling. Second, both the
average reflectance in Area 9 over the entire BP temperature range
and the maximum reflectance (approximately 35 and 49%, respectively)
are much higher than those in Area 26 (approximately 22 and 35%, respectively).
The higher reflectivity of BP in the microwell reveals the fact that
the BP is partially oriented by the walls of the microwell and thus
is closer to a single crystal.20 Third,
the peak wavelength of the reflection in Area 9 is much more thermally
stable than that in Area 26. The reflection band and peak wavelength
in both areas have a similar trend on cooling, showing an initial
blue-shift followed by red-shift just after the LC enters the BP state
below TI–BP. The small blue-shift,
concurrently with a low reflectance, can be explained by a slightly
unstable obliqueness of the reflection planes of the BP crystals at
the initial forming stage of the platelets around the TI–BP and the later red-shift concurrently with
an increased reflectance arises from the intrinsic property of negative
temperature dependence of pitch for a general BP system (i.e., dP/dT < 0). After the red-shift, the
peak wavelength of reflection in Area 9 remains constant around 558
nm for approximately 20 °C, whereas Area 26 effectively shows
no stable temperature region. The peak stability over 20 °C of
the BP state in Area 9 suggests high stability of the formed BP crystals
leading to high reflectivity over the entire range. All the abovementioned
results provide clear evidence that the structure of the honeycomb
microwells combined with the substrate boundary provides an omnidirectional
stabilization of the BP crystals significantly improving the photonic
features. The lowest energy state or stable state of LC can change
when LC is constrained by external microstructures21 as evidenced by previous work, which showed similar effects
in nematic LC using polymeric microscaffolds to extend the metastable
state.22 This supports our observation
of the large extension of the temperature range of the BP inside microstructures
presented in this work. These manifest improvements of the BP stability
in microstructures open up potential for applications outside the
laboratory, for example in displays and photonic switches.

To
verify the abovementioned omnidirectional stabilization effect
of the sample with the honeycomb microwells, we perform similar cooling
experiments based on two traditional BP samples with the same BP mixture
as that used in the abovementioned experiment but without the microstructure.
The two samples are divided into four regions with different boundary
conditions: regions 1 and 2 with nonrubbed and rubbed polyvinyl alcohol
(PVA) film, respectively, and 3 and 4 with nonrubbed and rubbed polyimide
(PI) film, respectively. Each rubbed sample was mechanically rubbed
three times. The transition points of TI–BP and TBP–CLC and ΔTBP at different regions of the two samples are
recorded and summarized in Table 1. The values of TI–BP and TBP–CLC measured in the four
regions of the BP samples are limited between 50 and 52 °C and
between 43 and 45 °C, respectively, such that the values of ΔTBP lie between 5 and 7 °C. This result
shows that the discrepancy of the BP temperature range for the four
regions of different alignment conditions is very small. According
to the previous literature,23−26 the general order for the azimuthal anchoring strength
in regions 1–4 (Wi, i = 1–4) would be W1 ≈ 10–7 to 10–6 J/m2 < W2 ≈ 10–5 to 10–4 J/m2 ≅ W3 ≈ 10–5 to 10–4 J/m2 < W4 ≈ 10–4 to 10–3 J/m2. Such a large difference of azimuthal anchoring strength,
for example, between W1 (isotropically
weak anchor) and W4 (anisotropically strong
anchor) can only lead to a very small difference of ΔTBP less than 1.0 °C. This result shows
that both the strength and directionality of the anchoring force arising
from the sample substrate alone has only a small impact on the transition
points and only effectively stabilizes the blue phase liquid crystal
(BPLC) molecules with orientations parallel to the substrate plane.
As the BP ordering involves large scale 3D structure, it seems logical
that stabilization in other directions will be necessary to maintain
a BP as the lowest free energy state.

In general, it is necessary to apply an electric field
or provide
an anisotropically strong anchoring force on the LC molecules from
the sample substrates during the formation of the BP crystals to obtain
more uniformly oriented BP crystals.27−29 Herein, although no
electric field or strong anchoring force from the aligned substrates
is exerted on the LC molecules, the results suggest that the hexagonal
microcell can lead to highly ordered crystal growth and high uniformity
of lattice plane orientation. In other words, the BPs in each microwell
of the microstructure have a higher probability to grow into a single-crystal-like
domain, unlike the polycrystalline BP outside the microstructure.
However, whether or not highly ordered crystal growth can contribute
to a wider BP temperature range, was not fully investigated. Further
studies will be performed to determine the relation between the condition
for crystal growth and the temperature range of BP.

Previous
literature has demonstrated that two kinds of nucleation
process probably occur in the crystal growth of BP: homogeneous and
heterogeneous nucleations,30,31 corresponding to nucleation
in the bulk and at the surface, respectively. We expect homogeneous
nucleation to lead to randomly ordered and oriented polycrystalline
BP, whereas heterogeneous growth from walls of the microstructure
should lead to the growth of ordered single crystals. To more clearly
identify the mechanism for the process of the crystal growth of the
BP in the honeycomb microwell cell, we focused the illumination light
into a single unit of the microwell to dynamically observe the reflective
image of BP in a single hexagonal microcell as it cooled from the
isotropic state to room temperature. The process is recorded in Movie S2 (refer to the Supporting Information)
and the images at some important moments of the movie are selected
and summarized in Figure 5. It should be noticed that the concentration of the chiral
dopant used in the experiment is reduced slightly (the concentration
of the chiral dopant becomes 32.5 wt %) to make more apparent color
change during the crystal growth process. When the sample is cooled
just below the clear point, the twisting force from the chiral dopant
begins to orient the LC molecules in a helical sense locally, and
thus randomly orientated DTCs form uniformly in the entire microcell.
These can be observed from the blue-green scattering of these DTCs,
as shown in Figure 5a. The bright blue-green DTCs tend to redistribute and aggregate
to the center and the six corners of the hexagonal microcell [Figure 5b]. With further
decrease of temperature, the DTCs at some corners of the hexagonal
microcell begin to stack with each other in an ordered way through
interaction with the polymer walls of the corners. In the heterogeneous
nucleation stage, red cubic BP crystals with the crystalline planes
normal to the substrate near these corners form, as shown in Figure 5c. These ordered
BP crystals then grow continuously from the corners to the center
of the microcell [Figure 5d] and eventually cover almost the entire microcell (the area
near the right corner of the microwell is overexposed in the camera).
The red BP crystals remain in a wide temperature range under the stabilization
of the polymer walls of the microcell until the temperature approaches TBP–CLC. Once arriving at TBP–CLC, the reflection color in the center of the
microcell starts to become emerald green [Figure 5e] and then diffuses to the boundary of the
microcell concurrently with the blue-shift to the final blue color
as the temperature is lower than TBP–CLC [Figure 5f,g]. From Figure 5e–g, we find
that the BP near the boundary of the honeycomb can be retained in
the BP state slightly longer before turning into a focal conic state
during the natural cooling process. This result is reasonable given
the stabilization from the polymer walls is weakest at the center.
The transient blue-shift of the reflection color is probably attributed
to the reorganization of the chiral dopants from 3D orientation in
BP with the double-twist structure to 2D orientation in the CLC phase
with the single-twist structure. Figure 5h is the final stage of the cooling process,
at which the LC material in the microstructure has become the stable
CLC focal conic phase completely.

conic state.

The data in Figure 5 suggest that the
polymer walls of the microcell can stabilize the
BP crystal structure for an extended temperature range. We have done
preliminary tests to see if the stability is the same on warming and,
so far, we see little or no extension of the BP stability range. This
supports the previous work32 which suggests
that the PC DTC rod structure is metastable and locked in place by
the microstructure once it has formed. However, the microstructure
does not change the temperature (∼48 °C) for the onset
of BP formation.

Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated
a micro-honeycomb structure by direct
laser writing (DLW) and found that it can significantly improve several
optical features of the BP including a dramatic extension of the stable
temperature range, much higher reflectivity, and much better thermal
stability of the reflection peak wavelength. The main factor contributing
to this result is the weak boundary force provided by the polymeric
microwell structure combined with the substrate of the sample which
helps to anchor and template the growth of uniformly oriented DTC
logpile crystals. Once these templated crystals have formed, it becomes
difficult for the DTC to unwind into the CLC phase under the stabilization
of the polymer walls. This statement is supported by warming experiments
and other studies25 where we find little
or no extension of the BP stability region. This microstructure stabilization
of the BP also triggers new inspiration about the academic research
into BP-based devices and their further industrial applications.

Experimental
Section
Sample Preparation
The 2D honeycomb microwell structures
in this paper were fabricated using a commercial DLW system (Photonic
Professional, Nanoscribe GmbH) based on the two-photon polymerization
(TPP) technique. A 780 nm femtosecond laser beam (with pulse width
≈ 120 fs and repetition rate ≈ 80 MHz) was focused into
a negative photoresist (IP-L 780, Nanoscribe GmbH) for triggering
TPP process by a high numerical aperture (NA = 1.4) oil immersion
objective lens (100×, Zeiss). There were no specific procedure
requirements regarding cleaning the microwells. The developed polymer
was rinsed in isopropyl alcohol and then dried in clean nitrogen.
Following this, the BP mixture was drop-cast onto the microstructure
filling the array. Then a coverslip without rubbing treatment was
directly placed on the top of the microstructure to enclose the BP
mixture. The height of the microstructure, 6.4 μm, is the thickness
of the LC layer. The BP mixture used in this study was composed of
nematic LC, HTW-114200-100 (Fusol), and chiral dopant, S811 (Merck),
in the ratio of 64.6:35.4 by weight. The material was first heated
to the isotropic state and injected into the 2D honeycomb microwell
structures on the substrate by drop-cast. During the injecting process,
the temperature of the substrate was controlled at 53 °C by a
hot stage for ensuring the isotropic state of the BP mixture. After
each hexagonal cell in the 2D honeycomb microwell structures was full
of the mixture, the excess of the mixture was removed and then a cover
slip is put on the top of the microwell for enclosing it. Following
the sample was cooled down with a slow cooling rate of 0.1 °C
min–1 for the growth of the BP crystals in the microstructure
cells.

Experimental Setups
Home-made transmission-type POM
was employed for observing the phases of the LC material in the sample
of microstructure array. For measuring reflectance, a setup was built
up separately as described below. Light from a halogen bulb was coupled
to a multimode fiber (with a core diameter of 300 μm) and collimated
by an objective lens (4×). The collimated light was focused by
a high numerical aperture (magnification: 63×, NA: 0.75) objective
lens on the sample to reduce the spot size around 20 μm, which
was smaller than the unit cell of the microstructure array. Reflected
light was collected by the same objective lens and picked off in a
50% beamsplitter followed by an achromatic lens which refocus the
reflection light to a detection plane, either a CMOS camera (Thorlab
DCC1645C) for imaging, or a detecting fiber with a core diameter of
200 μm and connecting to a spectrometer (USB2000, Ocean Optics)
for spectrometry.
