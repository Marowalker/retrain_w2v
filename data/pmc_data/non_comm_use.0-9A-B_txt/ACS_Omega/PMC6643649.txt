Mg–Al
mixed oxides with record-high surface areas and basic
site concentrations were synthesized from Mg–Al layered double
hydroxides with interlayer isethionate (Ise) or 3-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate
(HPS). Anion exchange of interlayer CO32– in synthetic hydrotalcites with the organic sulfonates induces disorders
in layer stacking as characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and
enables facile delamination in water. Thermal treatment of materials
anion-exchanged by Ise (MgAl–Ise) and HPS (MgAl–HPS)
in N2 and H2 resulted in the formation of Mg–Al
mixed oxides with marked enhancement in Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area relative to those treated in air. Treatment in
a flow of H2 is particularly effective, doubling the surface
area of mixed oxides derived from MgAl–Ise relative to those
obtained in a flow of N2. A higher degree of disorder in
layer stacking in MgAl–HPS than MgAl–Ise resulted in
the formation of Mg–Al mixed oxides with higher surface areas
than those from MgAl–Ise. As a result, thermal activation of
MgAl–HPS in a flow of H2 yielded Mg–Al mixed
oxides with the highest BET surface area (410 m2 g–1) and CO2 uptake (1.6 mmol g–1 at 25 °C and 100 kPa) in all samples. These values are significantly
higher than those obtained from the initial hydrotalcites as well
as those reported in the literature with similar Mg–Al ratios.
Investigation of the thermal activation steps by thermogravimetric
analysis and mass spectrometry indicates that the key factors to achieve
high surface area and CO2 uptake are to weaken interactions
between layers by inducing stacking disorders and to facilitate the
removal of interlayer sulfonates by preventing the formation of sulfates
from them via thermal activation under a reducing environment.

Introduction
Delamination of lamellar
materials forms nanosheets, which offers
an opportunity to synthesize high-external-surface-area materials
with highly accessible active sites.1 A
general challenge for this route is the restacking of nanosheets upon
drying and calcination.2 Layered double
hydroxides (LDHs) consist of brucite-like positively charged layers
and interlayer anions and possess the general formula of [M1–x2+Mx3+(OH)2]x+[Ax/nn–]·mH2O, where M2+, M3+, and
An– represent divalent and trivalent
metal cations and interlayer anions, respectively.3 These materials serve as precursors to materials used for
a wide range of applications such as catalysts and adsorbents.4−16 Anion exchanges of interlayer carbonates in Mg–Al LDHs with
isethionate (HO(CH2)2SO3–, Ise)17 and chlorides in Zn–Al
LDHs with dodecyl sulfate (CH3(CH2)11SO4– for Zn–Al LDHs)18 are known to allow facile delamination in water
and butanol, respectively. However, calcination of the resulting solids
in a flow of air to obtain mixed metal oxides converts interlayer
organic sulfur species to inorganic sulfate species.19 The interlayer sulfates graft on the surface of LDHs during
calcination, bridge neighboring nanosheet layers, and form metal salts.19,20 Consequently, the resultant mixed oxides possess only low porosity.
In addition, the removal of such sulfate species requires heat treatment
at temperatures ∼900 °C, where metal oxides inevitably
sinter and transform into different phases such as spinel.

We
have recently reported that thermal activation of Mg–Al
LDH possessing Ise (MgAl–Ise) in a flow of N2 facilitates the removal of interlayer Ise and enhances the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the resultant
mixed oxides by up to 8 times relative to that treated in a flow
of air.21 In this work, we report
two new findings: (1) anion exchange of synthetic hydrotalcite (MgAl–CO3) with 3-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (HO(CH2)3SO3–, HPS) induces a higher degree
of disorder in layer stacking than that with Ise. (2) Thermal activation
in a flow of H2 enhanced the BET surface area of Mg–Al
mixed oxides derived from MgAl–LDHs containing organic sulfonates
relative to those obtained using a N2 flow. Combining these
two findings led to the successful synthesis of Mg–Al oxides
with a record-high BET surface area of 410 m2 g–1 and a CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.6 mmol g–1 at 25 °C and 100 kPa. Both of these properties significantly
exceed the corresponding values for Mg–Al mixed oxides obtained
from conventional MgAl–CO3 used in this work as
well as those reported in the literature.

Results and Discussion
Anion
Exchange and Delamination
Anion exchange of MgAl–CO3 (scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) with
Ise or HPS white powder solids. The powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) pattern characterizing MgAl–CO3 (Figure 1) exhibits sharp
(00l) reflections characteristic of the layered double
hydroxide phase. This diffraction pattern shows well-separated (110)
and (113) peaks in the mid-2θ region, indicating the absence
of turbostratic disorder.22 After anion
exchange by Ise and HPS, the (003) reflection shifted to lower 2θ
angles, indicative of the expansion of the interlayer space, 1.1 nm
for MgAl–Ise and 1.2 nm for MgAl–HPS, by accommodating
larger molecules (∼0.7 nm for Ise and ∼0.8 nm for HPS)
than CO32– (∼0.3 nm). The PXRD
data characterizing both MgAl–Ise and MgAl–HPS show
significantly broader (003) reflections and asymmetric 0kl reflections in the mid-2θ region with the extent being higher
for the latter sample. These results indicate the turbostratic disorder
of Mg–Al double hydroxide layers and higher extent of such
disorder for MgAl–HPS than MgAl–Ise. The higher extent
of disorder in MgAl–HPS may be caused by a longer alkyl chain
length of HPS than Ise, which presumably weakens interactions between
nanosheets in MgAl–HPS relative to those in MgAl–Ise.
The small shoulder at a 2θ value of approximately 11° in
the PXRD data for MgAl–HPS may be caused by unexchanged layers.
The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum characterizing MgAl–CO3 (Figure 2)
shows a band at 1374 cm–1, corresponding to interlayer
CO32–.3 After
anion exchange with Ise and HPS, the band nearly disappeared for Ise
and the relative intensity became reduced for HPS. In addition, new
intense bands appeared at approximately 1190 and 1042 cm–1, which are assigned to νas(SO3–) and νs(SO3–) of organic
sulfonates, respectively.17 A weak band
at about 1420 cm–1 can be assigned to the bending
mode of CH2.17 These data indicate
the near-complete anion exchange for MgAl–Ise and some unexchanged
carbonates remaining in MgAl–HPS. Ion chromatography analysis
show that sulfur contents in MgAl–Ise and MgAl–HPS were
8.56 and 5.45 wt %, respectively. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis
data in Figure 3 show
that water contents in MgAl–Ise and MgAl–HPS, which
had been determined by the weight loss below 200 °C, were 2.5
and 6.2 wt %, respectively. On the basis of these results coupled
with the IR data indicating a fraction of unexchanged CO32– in MgAl–HPS, the chemical formulae for
these samples are represented as [Mg3Al(OH)8(HOC2H4SO3)](0.5H2O)
for MgAl–Ise and [Mg3Al(OH)8(HOC3H6SO3)0.6(CO3)0.2](1.4H2O) for MgAl–HPS.

MgAl–LDH (Mg/Al atomic
ratio = 3) bearing Ise is known to
readily delaminate in water, yielding transparent colloidal suspensions
that exhibit Tyndall effects.17 Iyi et
al. demonstrated the successful delamination of the MgAl–LDH
layers by showing that solids recovered from such a suspension consisted
of delaminated nanosheets approximately 2 nm in thickness through
atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization.17 They showed further that dispersion of MgAl–LDH
with an Mg/Al ratio of 2 in water yielded a suspension with lower
transparency, which had been caused by fewer degrees of delamination
(thicknesses of nanosheets were in the range of 2–6 nm as characterized
by AFM). Dispersing our MgAl–Ise and MgAl–HPS samples,
which had been prepared from MgAl–CO3 with an Mg/Al
ratio of 3, in decarbonized water at 0.1 mg-solid (mL-water)−1 yielded similar transparent solutions with no visible solids and
the solutions exhibited Tyndall effects (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Thus, we infer successful
delamination of MgAl–LDHs layers in water.

Thermal Decomposition
Steps of the Mg–Al LDHs Characterized
by Thermogravimetric (TG) Analysis and Mass Spectrometry (MS)
TG analysis identifies several key steps in thermal decomposition
of LDHs.23 The data characterizing MgAl–CO3 heated in air (Figure 3, bottom) show weight losses associated with desorption of
solvent molecules present on the external surface and gallery space
at <200 °C,24 dehydroxylation of
the surface hydroxyls at 200–400 °C, and decomposition
to mixed metal oxides at >400 °C. The TG data recorded in
flowing
air and N2 nearly overlap each other, indicating the absence
of effects of the gas atmosphere. In contrast, the TG profiles characterizing
MgAl–Ise and MgAl–HPS exhibit significantly different
weight changes above 300 °C when they were heated in air or N2 (Figure 3,
middle and top). The profiles of MgAl–Ise and MgAl–HPS
heated in air show a steep weight loss at >900 °C, whereas
those
of MgAl–Ise and MgAl–HPS heated in N2 show
the absence of such weight loss in this temperature region; the latter
profiles show that the corresponding weight loss occurs at <600
°C. The TG profiles obtained in air and N2 resulted
in the same final weight loss at 1200 °C, indicating the formation
of the same final phase at this temperature. When MgAl–Ise
and MgAl–HPS are heated in flowing air, reactions 1 and 2 are assumed to
proceed, both of which lead to the liberation of SO3,25 respectively. 1   2  The weight losses associated with
these conversions
are calculated as 54 and 52 wt %, respectively. These results are
consistent with the TG experiments that show a weight loss of approximately
51 wt %.

It is known that interlayer sulfates in LDHs graft
between layers and form metal sulfates upon calcination in air and
that decomposition of metal sulfates and desorption of sulfur oxides
occurs at ∼900 °C.19 Thus,
the results suggest that thermal treatment in N2 prevents
the formation of sulfates from Ise and facilitates the removal of
sulfur species at a relatively low temperature.21 The TG profile for MgAl–HPS in N2 shows
a much steeper weight loss at 400 °C than that of MgAl–Ise
in N2, suggesting that the removal of HPS may be more facile
than that of Ise because of the higher disorder in the structure of
MgAl–HPS. Both profiles for MgAl–Ise and MgAl–HPS
in N2 show only small weight losses above 600 °C,
indicating that the majority of sulfur species can be removed at temperatures
below 600 °C.

Because our TG instrument has a limited material
capability to
conduct experiments in H2 at elevated temperatures, similar
thermal activation experiments were conducted in flowing 10% H2 in helium, air, or helium, which can be considered as equivalent
to N2 in this experiment, in a quartz tubular reactor containing
MgAl–Ise while the exhaust from the reactor was monitored by
a mass spectrometer. The MS data recorded in flowing air (Figure 4) show mass signals
ascribed to sulfur oxides at 400, 600, and ∼1000 °C. In
contrast, the MS data collected in flowing helium and 10% H2 in helium show mass signals only at 300–550 °C. In addition,
the MS spectrum recorded in helium shows a small shoulder at approximately
500 °C, whereas that in 10% H2 in helium shows near
absence of such a shoulder. The results confirm that removal of sulfur
species is more facile in reducing gases like H2 or inert
gases like helium and N2 than oxidizing gases like air,
and that H2 facilitates removal of such species than
an inert gas.

Figure 4 Mass spectra (m/z 64,
SO2) of the effluent gases from the tubular reactor containing
MgAl–Ise in flowing air (green), helium (blue), or 10% H2 in helium (red). The data were normalized with respect to
the helium signal (m/z 4).

Grafting of Sulfates on
LDH Layers Characterized by PXRD
Some papers19,20 reported a larger contraction
in basal spacing and smaller gallery height of LDHs possessing interlayer
sulfates than those possessing other anions like CO32– when they were heated to 200 °C. Researchers
attributed these differences to the grafting of sulfates on the surface
of LDH layers. Because our TG data show different weight changes above
300 °C under different gas atmospheres, MgAl–Ise and MgAl–HPS
samples were treated in a flow of air, N2, or 10% H2 in helium for 3 h and the resultant materials were characterized
by PXRD. Samples treated in air (MgAl–Ise-A300 and MgAl–HPS-A300)
show smaller basal spacings than other samples (Figure 5). If the thickness of the brucite layer
(4.77 Å) is subtracted from the basal spacing for MgAl–HPS-A300,
a gallery height of 3.03 Å can be estimated. This value is much
smaller than the size of a sulfate ion (4.8 Å), indicating that
grafting of sulfates had occurred at 300 °C under an air flow.
In contrast, the samples treated in N2 and H2 show larger gallery heights. In particular, MgAl–HPS treated
in 10% H2 in helium (MgAl–HPS-H300) shows the largest
gallery height in all samples. Subtraction of the thickness of the
brucite layer from the basal spacing for this sample gives the gallery
height of 4.8 Å, which is essentially the same as the size of
a sulfate ion. These results indicate that thermal activation in H2 and N2 is effective to minimize irreversible grafting
of sulfates on LDH layers, which presumably led to more facile removal
of sulfur species in H2 and N2 than in air.

300 °C for 3 h in a flow of air (green), N2 (blue),
and 10% H2 in helium (red). The values show the basal spacings.

Porous Properties
Surface Area
After thermal activation above 300 °C,
all LDHs were converted into mixed oxides (or a mixture of metal oxides
and sulfates). The PXRD data for MgAl–CO3 and MgAl–Ise
treated in air or N2 were reported previously21 and those for MgAl–HPS are shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. All
of the PXRD data characterizing samples that were treated at 400–600
°C show two broad peaks that are indicative of periclase phase.
However, the samples exhibit significantly different porous properties.
N2 adsorption data show that MgAl–Ise calcined in
air at 400 °C (MgAl–Ise-A400) possesses a low BET
surface area (Figure 6d, BET plots are shown in Figure S4 in
the Supporting Information). Replacing air with N2 during
heat treatment significantly enhanced the surface area probably because
a higher fraction of sulfur species was removed during heat treatment,
as described in the preceding section. Using H2 instead
of N2 during thermal activation led to a further increase
in the surface area to approximately 350 m2 g–1. Increasing the duration of H2 treatment of MgAl–Ise
from 3 to 6 h yielded Mg–Al mixed oxide (MgAl–Ise-H400-H400)
that possesses nearly the same BET surface area (357 m2 g–1, adsorption isotherm shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) as MgAl–Ise-H400,
showing that treatment for longer than 3 h gives no enhancement in
the surface area.

in (a–c) correspond to adsorption and desorption branches,
respectively. The insets in (a–c) represent pore size distributions
determined by applying the data in adsorption branch to the Dollimore–Heal
method.

Calcination of MgAl–HPS
in air yielded Mg–Al mixed
oxides (MgAl–HPS-A400) with a BET surface area of 125 m2 g–1. This value is much higher than that
for MgAl–Ise-A400, which may be enabled by a higher degree
of stacking disorder in MgAl–HPS as characterized by PXRD (Figure 1). Changing the gas
atmosphere from air to N2 in the thermal activation resulted
in a significant increase in BET surface area, which exceeds that
of MgAl–Ise-H400. Furthermore, the sample obtained by the thermal
activation in H2 (MgAl–HPS-H400) exhibited the highest
BET surface area of 410 m2 g–1. This
value is ∼150 m2 g–1 higher than
mixed oxides derived from the original MgAl–CO3 and
those reported in the literature5,26−29 (Table 1). Thus,
the results demonstrate the significant effects of the combination
of stacking disorder of Mg–Al double hydroxide nanosheets that
had been induced by anion exchange by Ise and HPS, the different reactivity
of these interlayer sulfonates in different gas atmosphere, and the
proper conditions of thermal activation on the porous properties of
Mg–Al mixed oxides.

Porous Structure
Although understanding of thermal
activation behavior of LDHs is important,26 exact mechanism of the genesis of pores upon thermal activation
of LDHs generally remains elusive and the porosity of thermally activated
layered hydroxides is not well understood. Characterization by field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) shows that MgAl–CO3-H400 retained the sand-rose morphology, whereas MgAl–Ise-H400
and MgAl–HPS-H400 lost such morphology and sheets seem to have
curled and bent as shown in Figure S6 in
the Supporting Information. These changes were caused presumably by
stacking disorders of layers in the latter samples. The adsorption
isotherm data characterizing samples obtained from MgAl–Ise
and MgAl–HPS in N2 and H2 flow exhibit
type-IV isotherms like those characterizing samples derived from MgAl–CO3 (Figure 6a–c),
indicating that the samples are micro-mesoporous like many other Mg–Al
oxides derived from LDHs. The data show type H3 hysteresis,30 suggesting that slit-shaped pores formed between
platelike particles. Because the difference in the shape of the adsorption
isotherms resides mostly in the low-pressure region (relative pressure
<0.1) and the mesopore size distributions are similar among samples
except for MgAl–Ise-A400 (Figure 6, insets), we infer that the enhanced surface
area originates mostly from the increase in the number of micropores.
Because interlayer sulfonates caused the significant difference in
porous properties, we infer that these micropores originate from spaces
formed between nanosheets.

CO2 Adsorption
To examine potential application
of mixed oxides derived by the current method to CO2 adsorbents,
catalysts, and catalyst supports, CO2 uptakes were measured
at 25 °C. Mg–Al mixed oxides derived from MgAl–CO3 show CO2 uptakes at 1.0–1.2 mmol g–1 (Figure 7 and Table 1). Both MgAl–Ise-A400 and MgAl–HPS-A400 exhibit lowered
CO2 uptakes because of their low surface areas and the
existence of sulfate species that block basic sites. MgAl–Ise-N400
and MgAl–HPS-N400 exhibit significantly higher CO2 uptakes than those obtained by calcination in air because of the
higher fractions of the removal of sulfur species. However, areal
CO2 densities, which were calculated by dividing each CO2 uptake by the corresponding BET surface area, were both 1.9-CO2 nm–2. This value is less than the value
for MgAl–CO3-A400 (2.4-CO2 nm–2), suggesting the partial blocking of basic sites by sulfur species.
In contrast, both MgAl–Ise-H400 and MgAl–HPS-H400 exhibit
an areal CO2 density of 2.4-CO2 nm–2, demonstrating the beneficial effects of thermal activation in a
reducing environment. The high CO2 uptakes by MgAl–HPS-H400
relative to those for mixed oxides derived from MgAl–CO3 suggest that some of the micropores created between nanosheets
may be accessible more readily by CO2 (kinetic diameter
= 3.3 Å) than N2 (kinetic diameter = 3.6 Å).
MgAl–HPS-H400 exhibited the highest CO2 uptake because
of its high surface area, suggesting prospective applications to catalysts,
catalyst supports, and adsorbents.

Conclusions
In this work, a new strategy to synthesize
Mg–Al mixed oxides
with high surface area and concentration of basic sites is provided.
Anion exchange of MgAl–CO3 with Ise and HPS caused
expansion of interlayer with disordered stacking of Mg–Al double
hydroxide nanosheets, and HPS caused a higher degree of disorder in
layer stacking as indicated by the broader XRD reflections. The resultant
materials, MgAl–Ise and MgAl–HPS, can be dispersed in
water. However, subsequent drying and calcination in air yielded MgAl
mixed oxides with low surface areas because of the decomposition of
interlayer sulfonates to sulfates, which graft between layers and
form metal sulfates as indicated by the PXRD data. TG data confirm
that the removal of such sulfates requires temperatures ∼900
°C. In contrast, thermal treatments of MgAl–Ise and MgAl–HPS
in N2 and H2 facilitate the removal of interlayer
sulfur species at temperatures <600 °C. Consequently, treatments
in N2 and H2 led to marked increases in BET
surface area. Thermal activation in H2 is particularly
effective, enabling 2-fold enhancement in BET surface area of Mg–Al
mixed oxides relative to those obtained in flowing N2 in
the case of MgAl–Ise. When the thermal activation was applied
to MgAl–HPS, it yielded Mg–Al mixed oxides with the
highest BET surface area and CO2 uptake at 25 °C and
100 kPa in all samples. Further tailoring of the nature of interlayer
anions and thermal treatment conditions is anticipated to lead to
enhance these properties, which may open new applications of these
materials in the future.

Experimental Section
Materials
Hydrotalcite,
MgAl–CO3 (Kyoward
500PL, Mg3Al(OH)8(CO3)0.5·mH2O,) was obtained from Kyowa
Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. An SEM image of this material is shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information, showing
a sand-rose morphology. The chemical formula of MgAl–CO3 can be represented as [Mg3Al(OH)8(CO3)0.5·2.4H2O], as reported previously.21 Isethionic acid ammonium salt and 3-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic
acid sodium salt were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Japan, and used
as received. Ethanol (99.5%) and methanol (99.8%) were purchased
from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.

Anion Exchange of MgAl–CO3
MgAl–CO3 was anion-exchanged using
ammonium salt of Ise according
to the literature method.17 MgAl–CO3 (400 mg) was dispersed in 140 mL of ethanol in a 300 mL flask.
To this solution was added 380 mg of isethionic acid ammonium salt
in 60 mL of ethanol, which corresponds to a isethionates/carbonates
molar ratio of 2. The slurry was heated under a continuous flow of
N2 at 70 °C. After the slurry was stirred for 2 h,
the solids were collected by filtration and freeze-dried at a pressure
of 0.3 hPa and at a temperature of −10 °C overnight. The
anion-exchanged sample is abbreviated as MgAl–Ise. Anion-exchange
experiments with HPS were conducted by the same procedure as that
for MgAl–Ise except for using 440 mg of the HPS salts in methanol and
heating the slurry at 60 °C for 3 h. The anion-exchanged sample
is abbreviated as MgAl–HPS.

Thermal Activation Procedure
A photo of the experimental
setup was provided in our previous study.21 A MgAl–LDH sample (≈100 mg) was loaded on a ceramic
boat. The ceramic boat was loaded in a quartz tube reactor (2.5 cm
diameter and 65 cm length), and each end of the tube was fitted with
an Ultra-Torr-type fitting that is connected to a gas line and exhaust
line. MgAl–LDH samples were heated to 300–600 °C
at a ramp rate of 20 °C min–1 in flowing air,
N2, or 10% H2 in helium at a flow rate of 100
mL min–1 and held at the designated temperature
for 3 h. Then, the reactor was allowed to cool to ambient temperatures.
In some experiments, samples were treated again at the same temperature.
Samples are identified by a code of the form MgAl-Y-Zx-Zx or MgAl-Y-Zx, where x, Y, and Z stand for the temperature of thermal treatment,
type of anions (CO3, Ise, or HPS), and type of gases (A
= air and N = N2, H = H2), respectively. For
example, MgAl–Ise heated at 400 °C sequentially in flowing
H2 for 3 h and then in flowing H2 for an additional
3 h is denoted as MgAl–Ise-H400-H400. On the other hand, when
the same sample was heated only in flowing H2 at the same
temperature for 3 h, it is denoted as MgAl–Ise-H400.

Characterization
Elemental analysis for S was performed
at the Global Facility Center of Hokkaido University, using a Dionex
ICS1600 ion chromatography system. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
patterns were recorded on a Rigaku RINT Ultima IV equipped with a
Cu Kα source and a D/teX Ultra detector. Data were recorded
from 5 to 80° 2θ at a scan rate of 10° min–1. IR spectra of solid samples were collected on a JASCO Fourier transform
spectrometer (FT/IR-6100) equipped with an MCT detector cooled to
77 K by liquid N2. Powder samples were pressed between
KBr plates using a JASCO engineering Tablet Master series and loaded
into the sample chamber of the instrument. Data were recorded under
vacuum in transmission mode with a spectral resolution of 4 cm–1. Each spectrum is the average of 254 scans. Sample
morphology was characterized by a JEOL field emission scanning electron
microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6500F) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV.
Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C on
a MicrotracBEL BELSORP-max. Prior to analysis, a powder sample (∼40
mg) in a preweighed analysis tube was heated under dynamic vacuum
at 350 °C. After 2 h of heating, the analysis tubes were cooled
to ambient temperatures, filled with inert gas, and capped to prevent
the intrusion of air and moisture during transfer. The analysis tubes
containing activated samples were transferred to an electrical balance
and weighed to determine the mass of the samples. The tubes were transferred
back to the analysis port of the instrument and sorption isotherms
were collected using N2 gas (99.999% purity, Hokkaido Air
Water) with an initial dosing amount of 0.1 cm3 (STP) g–1. Specific surface areas were calculated using the
BET model,31 selecting initial low-pressure
points in the relative pressure range below 0.3 and assuming the cross-sectional
area of a N2 molecule to be 0.162 nm2. Pore
size distributions were determined by applying data in the adsorption
branch to the Dollimore–Heal method.32 CO2 adsorption isotherms were collected on a MicrotracBEL
BELSORP-max at 25 °C. Samples were pretreated under dynamic vacuum
at 350 °C for 2 h prior to adsorption experiments. To analyze
the thermal activation steps of MgAl–LDH samples, thermogravimetric
(TG) experiments were performed on a NETZSCH STA 2500 Regulus thermogravimetric
analyzer. Approximately 10 mg of a sample was heated to 1200 °C
in N2 or air flowing at a rate of 20 mL min–1. Analysis of thermal activation steps was also conducted using a
tubular reactor. Approximately 50 mg of a sample was held on a plug
of quartz wool within a quartz tubular reactor (10 mm I.D.) placed
in a resistively heated furnace (Asahi Rika, ARF-30K). Samples were
heated to 1000 °C at a ramp rate of 20 °C min–1 in 10% H2 in helium balance, air, or helium flowing at
a flow rate of 30 mL min–1, while the effluent gas
was analyzed by a MicrotracBEL BELMass quadrupole mass spectrometer.
