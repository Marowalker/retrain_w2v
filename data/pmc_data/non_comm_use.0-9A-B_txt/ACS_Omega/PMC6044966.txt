In the last years, outer membrane
vesicles have attracted a lot
of attention for the development of vaccines against bacterial pathogens.
Extracellular vesicles can be obtained in high yields by genetic mutations,
resulting in generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA). Methods
to check the quality, consistency of production, and stability of
GMMA vaccines are of fundamental importance. In this context, analytical
methods for size distribution determination and verifying the integrity
and possible aggregation of GMMA particles are strongly needed. Herein,
GMMA particle size distribution has been evaluated by means of three
different techniques. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), multiangle light
scattering (MALS) coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography–size
exclusion chromatography (SEC), and nanoparticle tracking analysis
(NTA) have been compared to characterize GMMA from different mutants
of Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis strains. We found that the
presence of O-antigen chains on GMMA determined higher Z-average diameters by DLS compared to size estimation by MALS and
that the hydrodynamic diameter increased with the number of O-antigen
chains per GMMA particle. In the case of SEC-MALS, the size of the
whole population better reflects the size of the most abundant particles,
whereas DLS diameter is more influenced by the presence of larger
particles in the sample. SEC-MALS and NTA are preferable to DLS for
the analysis of bimodal samples, as they better distinguish populations
of different size. MALS coupled to a size exclusion chromatography
module also allows checking the purity of GMMA preparations, allowing
determination of generally occurring contaminants such as soluble
proteins and DNA. NTA permits real-time visualization with simultaneous
tracking and counting of individual particles, but it is deeply dependent
on the choice of data analysis parameters. All of the three techniques
have provided complementary information leading to a more complete
characterization of GMMA particles.

Introduction
Outer membrane vesicles (OMV) are small
bilayered membrane structures
naturally released from the cell surface of the Gram-negative bacteria.
Simplicity of production and high immunogenicity of these particles,
which mimic those of the external surface of bacteria, have made OMV
particularly attractive for the development of vaccines against bacterial
pathogens.1 Extracellular vesicles can
be obtained in high yields2 by genetic
manipulation, resulting in generalized modules for membrane antigens
(GMMA).3,4 Further mutations are usually introduced
to reduce GMMA toxicity by modifying, for example, the acylation pattern
of lipid A.5,6 Recently, a bivalent formulation of Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella
enteritidis GMMA has been proposed as a vaccine candidate
against nontyphoidal Salmonella, the leading cause
of morbidity and death in sub-Saharan Africa, for which a vaccine
is not yet available.7

GMMA are complex
systems and an in-depth characterization is needed
to assure consistency of production and stability over time. Particle
size distribution is among the characteristics of GMMA to be investigated
for their full characterization.8,9

A number of techniques
are available for particle size measurement,10−12 including dynamic
light scattering (DLS), multiangle light scattering
(MALS), and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA).

DLS, also
known as photon correlation spectroscopy or quasielastic
light scattering (QELS), is a popular and routine technique used for
the measurement of size distribution of small particles in suspension
since 1960s.11,13,14 This technique is used to obtain a mean hydrodynamic diameter (Z-average diameter) and a polydispersity index (PDI), describing
the amplitude of the distribution. Hydrodynamic diameter is calculated
using the Stokes–Einstein equation, obtaining the diffusion
coefficient by measuring intensity
fluctuations of scattered light produced by particles as they undergo
Brownian motion. MALS represents a static light scattering technique.15,16 Depending on the analysis model, MALS determines, using the angular
dependence of the time-averaged scattering intensity, the geometric
radius (Rgeo) or the root-mean-square
radius, commonly known as the radius of gyration (Rg).

NTA is an alternative light-scattering technique
useful for the
evaluation of size and number of individual particles,17 ranging from 10 to 2000 nm in size, in liquids.8,18,19 As for the DLS, the particle
diameter is calculated using the Stokes–Einstein
equation, but by measuring directly the diffusion coefficient of particles
moving under Brownian motion, relating the rate of particle motion
to particle size.20,21

Here, DLS, HPLC-SEC/MALS,
and NTA were applied for determining
particle size distribution of GMMA produced by different S. typhimurium- and S. enteritidis-mutated strains. Advantages and limitations of each type of methods
are discussed.

Results and Discussion
Size distribution
analysis was performed on GMMA from different S. typhimurium- and S. enteritidis-mutated strains.
In particular, STm 1418 ΔtolR GMMA and STm
1418 ΔtolR ΔwbaP GMMA
were selected to see the differences between OAg-positive (OAg+) and OAg-negative (OAg–) GMMA. SEn 618
ΔtolR ΔmsbB ΔpagP GMMA and STm 2192 ΔtolR ΔpagP ΔmsbB represent the possible
candidate vaccines for use in humans, where the deletion of msbB and pagP was used to minimize reactogenicity.

Size Distribution
Analysis by DLS
SEn 618 ΔtolR ΔmsbB ΔpagP GMMA exhibited a Z-average diameter of 111.07 nm.
STm 2192 ΔtolR ΔpagP ΔmsbB and STm 1418 ΔtolR GMMA were characterized by a Z-average diameter
of 103.47 and 91.53 nm, respectively (Table 1, Figure 1A). No differences were found by analyzing the
samples at different protein concentrations (in the range 50–200
μg/mL). PDI values were in the range 0.15–0.19, indicating
a moderate polydispersity for the GMMA samples analyzed.

STm 1418
ΔtolR ΔwbaP GMMA were
characterized by a smaller size of 57.60 nm and a higher
PDI of 0.26 (Figure 1A, Table 1).

For SEn 618 ΔtolR ΔmsbB ΔpagP and STm
2192 ΔtolR ΔpagP ΔmsbB GMMA, three adjacent populations at different molecular
mass were separated by HPLC-SEC, and further analyzed by DLS. The Z-average diameter and the PDI values of the collected fractions
are summarized in Table 1.

High molecular mass (HMM) fractions, both for S.
enteritidis 618 and S. typhimurium 2192 GMMA, showed a particle size distribution similar to that found
for unfractionated GMMA. Fractions at the center of the distribution
(MMM) and low molecular mass fractions (LMM) showed decreased hydrodynamic
diameters with respect to the whole GMMA population.

Size Distribution
Analysis by SEC-MALS
All of the GMMA
preparations were analyzed by SEC-MALS by applying the “sphere”
model. The calculated diameters, averaged with different weights (2
× Rn, 2 × Rw, and 2 × Rz), are reported
in Table 2.

SEn 618 ΔtolR ΔmsbB ΔpagP, STm 2192 ΔtolR ΔpagP ΔmsbB, and STm
1418 ΔtolR GMMA were characterized by a similar
2 × Rz value (Table 2, Figure 1B).

Unlike DLS, showing one single population,
SEC-MALS analysis of
STm 1418 ΔtolR ΔwbaP GMMA revealed a bimodal distribution with the maxima at 2 × Rz = 55.40 and 101.80 nm, respectively (Figure 1B).

Samples
derived from HPLC-SEC fractionation of SEn 618 ΔtolR ΔmsbB ΔpagP and STm
2192 ΔtolR ΔpagP ΔmsbB GMMA were also analyzed by SEC-MALS.
Results relative to the collected fractions are summarized in Table 2.

Size Distribution
Analysis by NTA
All of the GMMA samples
were analyzed by NTA. Screen gain and camera level (shutter speed
and camera gain) were set at values 2 and 16, respectively, and selected
based on the visually brightest detection of particles without the
occurrence of abundant overscattering events.

After performing
a first set of experiments, we verified that the detection threshold
needed to be selected by the operator, according to the sample and
its dilution, to have consistent results both in terms of size and
particles counting.

Similar results, both in terms of size and
number of particles
per mg of GMMA proteins, were obtained by analyzing SEn 618 ΔtolR ΔmsbB ΔpagP GMMA at different dilutions (Table 3).

Similar data were collected for all of the GMMA samples

results are summarized in Table 4. Standard deviation (SD), D10, D50, and D90 percentile
values showed that GMMA samples were quite polydisperse.

The analysis of more homogeneous samples was performed
by analyzing
the MMM fractions from the SEC fractionation of GMMA (Table 4). More similarity was observed
between mean and mode hydrodynamic diameter compared to what was found
for the unfractionated GMMA. Lower SD and D90 and higher D10 values
clearly showed that a more homogeneous sample was obtained.

The mode diameters of the unfractionated samples were similar to
the mean values of the fraction corresponding to the central area
of the GMMA samples. NTA analysis of STm 1418 ΔtolR ΔwbaP GMMA revealed a high difficulty in
proper tracking and enumerating of the particles, probably due to
their smaller dimensions and higher polydispersity. Table 4 reports the mean and mode values
calculated for the entire population. However, NTA, similar to SEC-MALS,
was able to distinguish a major peak with a mode value of 55 nm and
a less abundant peak with a mode value of 85 nm.

Analysis of the whole GMMA populations
gave NTA mean diameters
similar to Z-average diameters by DLS. MMM populations,
obtained after the fractionation of GMMA samples, showed similar hydrodynamic
diameters, by DLS, and mean diameters, by NTA. Such values were also
similar to the NTA mode diameters of the corresponding whole populations.

For all of the OAg+ GMMA, the Z-average
size measured by DLS was higher compared to the 2 × Rz value obtained by SEC-MALS. The same behavior was not
found for ΔwbaP OAg– GMMA,
suggesting that higher values from DLS were not only due to the higher
weight of large particles in the average diameter calculation by this
method. The difference observed could be related to the presence of
the OAg chains displayed on the GMMA surface, which play a role in
determining the behavior of GMMA in the solution. OAg+ GMMA
were in fact characterized by different Z-average
diameters, but similar SEC-MALS diameters of around 70 nm (Table 5).

Number of
OAg chains per GMMA particle, OAg length, and structural
characteristics such as O-acetylation and glucosylation level, as
well as the amount of lipid A and its structure, could affect the
overall size of GMMA. By looking at these characteristics (Table 6), a correlation between
DLS diameters and average number of OAg chains per GMMA particle was
found (Figure 2A).
The size of OAg chains was similar for all of the OAg+ GMMA
tested, and no correlation was found between GMMA size and protein
or lipid A content (Figure 2B,C).

b Average number of OAg chains

and particles counting by NTA. Average number of lipid A molecules

Table 6 also reports
the ζ-potential values collected for different GMMA. All of
them can be considered approximately neutral in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS), with similar values for all of the OAg-positive GMMA
and a more negative value for the OAg-negative sample. DLS allowed
precise and reliable GMMA particle size analysis within few minutes,
with a rapid and simple sample preparation and instrument setup. A
major drawback of DLS is that it is inherently sensitive to the presence
of large particles in the sample used in the analysis,23 as verified by analyzing the unfractionated
and fractionated GMMA samples. It is expected that the DLS Z-average size distribution of polydisperse samples is biased
by even a small number of large particles because such particles scatter
light more efficiently than small ones.24,25 On the contrary,
with SEC-MALS, the diameter of the whole population better reflects
the size of the most abundant population.

SEC-MALS is also a
rapid and robust method for GMMA size characterization.
It allows separation and qualitative analysis of generally occurring
contaminants, such as free soluble proteins and DNA.

NTA is
an alternative light-scattering technology that simultaneously
but individually tracks and analyzes the trajectories of GMMA in suspension.
NTA can detect small, weakly scattering particles among large, strong-scattering
ones that would dominate the size distribution of a particle sample
analyzed by DLS. The mean size gives the average size of the whole
vesicles population and has a value similar to Z-average
diameter by DLS. But mode size characterizes the particle size that
appears most often within a given preparation.

NTA allows not
only size determination but also counting of the
number of particles. However, for NTA analysis, a range of parameters
need to be adjusted both for video capture (camera gain and shutter
speed) and data elaborations (filter settings, background subtraction,
removal of blurring, minimum track length, minimum expected particle
size, and detection threshold). This makes standardization of the
NTA technique, which is strongly operator dependent,17,23,26−28 difficult to
achieve.21 Our study confirmed that detection
threshold is one of the parameters that can strongly affect both size
and count of particles in NTA analysis.26 In particular, NTA analyses did not show an acceptable reproducibility
among experiments performed using scalar-diluted samples at a fixed
detection threshold value, both in GMMA size and concentration.

Conclusions
In conclusion, all of the three methods provide
size measurements
based on absolute analyses of the samples in solution, independent
of the calibration standards.

DLS is the most rapid method,
but SEC-MALS and NTA are preferable
in the case of bimodal samples, allowing better separation of populations
at different size. MALS coupled with SEC has also the advantage to
detect eventual presence of smaller mass impurities. NTA visualizes
and counts single particles also allowing determination of antigens
density on GMMA particle. In the specific case of S.
typhimurium GMMA, the number of OAg chains on the
GMMA surface affects the hydrodynamic radius determined by DLS and
mean size by NTA, but not Rgeo by MALS.

To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies describing the
use of NTA for OMV characterization29 and
comparing the use of different techniques for their size determination.
Complete characterization of OMV size is an important research topic
in the field of OMV vaccines development because it is essential to
check the consistency of production and stability of samples, and
to study differences among bacterial strains. All of the techniques
tested here provided useful information for a more complete evaluation
of the GMMA size.

Experimental Section
Strains for GMMA Production
S. typhimurium isolate SGSC1418
(LT-2 collection, University of Calgary), S. typhimurium 2192 (SGSC2192, SARA collection),
and S. enteritidis SA618 (CEESA EASSA
II collection of Quotient Bioresearch Limited) were used as parent
strains for GMMA production.22 Mutants
for GMMA production are described in Table 7 and were obtained as previously described.5tolR deletion increases the
GMMA release during bacteria growth, wbaP deletion
is associated with the loss of O-antigen (OAg) chains resulting in
an OAg-negative strain, whereas ΔpagP and ΔmsbB mutations have an impact on lipid A acylation pattern
and are introduced to have a pure penta-acylated lipid A detoxified
GMMA.5

GMMA Production
GMMA were produced
and purified as
previously described.5 After purification,
all of the GMMA samples were suspended in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) and then 0.22 μm filtered. GMMA content was estimated
as the total protein content by micro Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay
(BCA). OAg quantification was performed by high-performance anion
exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD)
analysis, and OAg size was calculated by HPLC-SEC analysis on a TSK
gel 3000 PWxl column using dextrans as standards. Number of lipid
A molecules were derived by HPLC-SEC/semicarbazide assay, as previously
described.7

Dynamic Light Scattering
(DLS)
DLS measurements were
performed with a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, Herremberg, Germany)
equipped with a 633 nm He–Ne laser and operating at an angle
of 173°. Scattering light detected at 173° was automatically
adjusted by laser attenuation filters. For data analysis, the viscosity
and refractive index (RI) of PBS buffer solution (at 25 °C) were
used. The software used to collect and analyze the data was the Zetasizer
software version 7.11. Temperature was set at 25 °C. Each sample
(80 μL) at 50, 125, and 200 μg/mL protein content was
characterized in duplicates in single-use polystyrene microcuvette
(ZEN0040, Alfatest) with a path length of 10 mm. The hydrodynamic
diameter of GMMA was expressed by a Z-average value
(general purpose algorithm) of three measurements for each replicate,
providing also a PDI of the size values calculated. Size distribution
by intensity was preferred to measurements by number or by volume
to have more reproducible results and because the RI values of GMMA
were not known, respectively.

Size Exclusion Chromatography
Coupled with Multiangle Light
Scattering (SEC-MALS)
GMMA samples were analyzed by HPLC-SEC
with Tosoh TSK gel G6000PW (30 cm × 7.5 mm) + G4000PW (30 cm
× 7.5 mm) columns in series equilibrated in PBS (PBS tablets,
Medicago) and with in-line UV, fluorescence emission, and MALS detectors.
A Wyatt Dawn Heleos II MALS equipped with fused silica cell and a
660 nm laser source were used. A volume of 80 μL of samples
with concentrations of 100 μg/mL protein content were injected
and eluted with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min (run time 70 min). All of
the dilutions were made in PBS. MALS data were collected using ASTRA
6 software (Wyatt Technology) with “particles” template
and analyzed using “Sphere” model. The size of GMMA
was expressed by the number average geometric radius Rn, weight average geometric radius Rw, and Z-average geometric radius Rz values.

Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis
(NTA)
NS300 Nanosight
instrument (Malvern) equipped with a CMOS camera and a 488 nm monochromatic
laser beam was used. Data acquisition and processing were performed
using NTA software 3.2 build 3.2.16. Automatic settings for the minimum
track length, the minimal expected particle size and blur setting
were applied. Viscosity settings for water were applied and automatically
corrected for the temperature used. Measurements were performed at
room temperature ranging from 22 to 25 °C. Particles movement
was analyzed by NTA software with camera level at 16, slider shutter
at 1300, and slider gain at 512. Different detection threshold values
were tested and adjusted for the sample appearance after dilution.
For each sample, five replicate videos of 30 s at 25 frames per second
were collected, generating five replicate histograms that were averaged.
Several dilutions of the samples were analyzed and duplicates were
recorded for every diluted sample. GMMA samples were PBS diluted in
low-binding Eppendorf tubes, and the dilutions were prepared just
before the analysis. Samples were gently mixed and slowly injected
in the sample chamber using a 1 mL syringe over 5–10 s. The
samples were recorded under controlled flow, using the NanoSight syringe
pump (speed 20). Each video was then analyzed to determine the respective
mean and mode (particle size that appears most often within a given
preparation) GMMA size. In addition to these values, standard deviation
(SD) and percentile undersize values (D10, D50, and D90) were collected.
SD, D10, D50, and D90 were measure of the spread of particles size
distribution within the samples. The concentrations of samples are
reported either as particles per mL or particles per frame.

HPLC-SEC
To obtain more homogeneous GMMA samples, a
volume of 100 μL with a concentration of 1000 μg/mL protein
content was fractionated by HPLC-SEC. Tosoh TSK gel G6000PW (30 cm
× 7.5 mm) + G4000PW (30 cm × 7.5 mm) columns in series equilibrated
in PBS (PBS tablets, Medicago) were used with in-line UV detector.
Samples were eluted with PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min (run time
70 min). GMMA peaks were fractionated in 1.7 mL low binding Eppendorf
tubes monitoring the 280 nm elution profile and collecting fractions
at the rate of one tube per minute.

ζ-Potential
ζ-potential measurements were
acquired on a Malvern Nano ZS instrument (Zetasizer software ver.
7.11) with the following sample settings: “Protein”
as material, “PBS” as dispersant, and “Smoluchowski”
as F(ka) selection model. The experiments were performed at 25 °C
with 120 s as equilibration time using a disposable folded capillary
cell (model DTS 1070) filled with 750 μL of sample. The measurement
duration was set as “automatic”, with a minimum and
maximum numbers of runs of 10 and 100, respectively, and a measurement
number of 3 with a 60 s delay. The attenuation and voltage of measurement
as well as the analysis model were set as automatic. The samples were
analyzed at 200 μg/mL protein concentration diluted in PBS.
