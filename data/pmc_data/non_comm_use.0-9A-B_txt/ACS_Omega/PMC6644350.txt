We present the structural properties
and electrochemical capacitance
of mesoporous MCo2O4 (M = Co, Zn, and Ni) rods
synthesized by a facile solvothermal route without necessity to use
templates. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface
areas of these mesoporous rods are found to be about 24, 54, and 62
m2 g–1 with major pore diameters of about
31, 15, and 9 nm for MCo2O4, M = Co, Zn, and
Ni, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction
studies reveal the phase purity of the samples with a predominant
spinel-type crystal structure. The spinel crystal structure with lattice
parameters of 8.118, 8.106, and 8.125 Å is obtained for MCo2O4, M = Co, Zn, and Ni, respectively. The transmission
electron microscopy study reveals that the mesoporous rods are built
by self-assembled aggregates of nanoparticles which are well-interconnected
to form stable mesoporous rods. The electrochemical capacitor performance
was investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge
cycling, and impedance spectroscopy in a three-electrode configuration.
As a result, the spinel-type MCo2O4 rods exhibit
high specific capacitances of 1846 F g–1 (CoCo2O4), 1983 F g–1 (ZnCo2O4), and 2118 F g–1 (NiCo2O4) at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. Furthermore, the mesoporous
spinel-type metal oxides show desirable stability in alkaline electrolyte
during long-term cycling with excellent cycling efficiency.

1 Introduction
Global demand for energy conversion and storage technology is anticipated
to rise rapidly because of the depletion of fossil fuels. Therefore,
researchers currently focus on developing electrochemical energy storage
technologies for sustainable energies by simple, effective, and eco-friendly
approaches.1−5 Supercapacitors are a new category of energy storage devices. They
have attracted much attention because of their fast charge/discharge
rate, high power density, high reliability, and long life cycle.6−9 RuO2 has been investigated extensively because of its
high specific capacitance (700 F g–1), high reliability,
and good reversibility.10,11 However, the high cost
and environmental harmfulness of RuO2 prevent its commercialization
in supercapacitors. Hence, various spinel-type binary metal oxides
A2+B23+O4 where A is a
divalent cation (Zn, Ni, Mn, Cu, etc.) and B is a trivalent cation
(Co, Fe, Mn, etc.) have been recently investigated as pseudocapacitors.12−21 Among the spinel-type metal oxides, the cobalt-based metal oxides
show better electrochemical properties.

Xiong et al. have investigated
the pseudocapacitor performance
of Co3O4 microspheres, and a specific capacitance
(Cs) of 92 F g–1 at
5 mA cm–2 is reported.15 Mousavi and co-workers have studied cauliflower-shaped nanostructured
CuCo2O4 with the Cs of 338 and 88 F g–1 at current densities of 1
and 50 A g–1, respectively.16 Krishnan et al. have studied the supercapacitance of nanostructured
spinel-type MCo2O4 (M = Cu, Mn, and Mg) obtained
by the molten salt method. The Cs values
of MgCo2O4, MnCo2O4, and
CuCo2O4 are 160, 288, and 152 F g–1, respectively, at a current density of 2 A g–1.17 Zhou et al. have fabricated one-dimensional
(1D) ZnCo2O4 porous nanotubes by electrospinning.
They have reported the Cs of ZnCo2O4 to be 770 F g–1 at a current
density of 10 A g–1 with excellent rate performance
and good cycling stability.18 Wu et al.
have investigated binder-free ZnCo2O4 nanorods
on a Ni fiber with a Cs of 10.9 F g–1 at 30 mV/s (scan rate).19 Dong and co-workers have reported a selective preparation route
for hierarchically mesoporous NiCo2O4 with a Cs of 1619.1 F g–1 at a current
density of 2 A g–1.20 Furthermore, the Cs of mesoporous NiCo2O4 was found to be 571.4 F g–1 at a high current density of 10 A g–1 with excellent
stability. Moreover, the nanostructured spinel-type metal oxides are
capable of delivering better electrochemical kinetics because of their
larger surface area and shorter paths for charge carrier movement
in comparison with their bulk counterparts. On the other hand, it
is found that metal oxides with appropriate porous or hierarchical
nanostructures can enhance the power density and also the cycling
stability of supercapacitors.20−23 Generally, mesoporous materials are fabricated by
using soft templates (surfactants or long-chain polymers) and hard
templates (mesoporous silica or carbon).24−26 However, some
complications occur for these methods because of the residual templates
in the final samples and the use of multistep procedures.

In
this work, we report the preparation of naturally self-assembled
porous spinel-type MCo2O4 rods (M = Co, Ni,
and Zn) by a facile solvothermal method. Structural properties of
these samples were investigated by means of powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) with selected area electron
diffraction (SAED), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
specific surface area analysis. The pseudocapacitance of the mesoporous
rods was comprehensively studied for all samples by cyclic voltammetry
(CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) cycling, and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy in a three-electrode configuration. KOH (6
M) was used as an electrolyte. The electrochemical capacitance Cs was 1846 F g–1 for CoCo2O4, 1983 F g–1 for ZnCo2O4, and 2118 F g–1 for NiCo2O4 at a scan rate of 2 mV/s, and an excellent cycling
stability was observed.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the TGA–differential thermal analysis (DTA) curves for the
MCo2O4 samples obtained at 80 °C. TG curves
show two well-distinct steps of weight loss for all samples. The first
weight loss occurs at temperatures up to 190 °C for CoCo2O4, 184 °C for ZnCo2O4, and 220 °C for NiCo2O4 which is due
to the evaporation of H2O. The second weight loss occurring
at temperatures up to 300, 405, and 405 °C for CoCo2O4, ZnCo2O4, and NiCo2O4, respectively, is associated with an exothermic peak
in the DTA curve (the DTA curve of CoCo2O4 only
shown for clarity) and is assigned to the decomposition of the anhydrous
oxalate into spinel-type metal oxides. The evaporation of CO and CO2 by decomposing the oxalates leads to the formation of porous
nanostructured materials. Furthermore, the distribution of pore size
and microstructure of the samples are investigated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) model and HR-TEM. The formation of mesoporous rods is schematically
illustrated in Figure 1b. During the initial synthesis process, the divalent (M2+ = Co2+/Ni2+/Zn2+) cations and trivalent
Co3+ cations are interlinked with ethylene glycol (EG)
and H2C2O4 molecules to form the
nanoclusters. Then, a large number of small crystals start to nucleate
and form the MCo2(C2O4)3 oxalates which is confirmed by XRD, as shown in Figure 1c. EG acts as a cross-linking
reagent to form the rod-shaped products.30 Finally, the rods are heated in air to transform to the porous spinel-type
metal oxide rods by the evaporation of CO and CO2.

of the formation of the mesoporous MCo2O4 rods
where M = Co, Zn, and Ni. (c) XRD pattern of the mesoporous MCo2O4 rods.

The XRD patterns of the MCo2O4 (M =
Co, Ni,
and Zn) samples obtained by a facile solvothermal approach and a post-annealing
approach at 450 °C for 2 h are shown in Figure 1c. All the peak positions at 2θ values
of 31.16°, 36.86°, 38.64°, 44.80°, 55.60°,
59.30°, 65.24°, and 77.42° match well with the spinel-type
structure (JCPDS #73-1701), and these peaks correspond to the following
Miller indices (hkl): (220), (311), (222), (400),
(422), (511), (440), and (533), respectively. These results reveal
that the samples contain exclusively the spinel phase. The unit cell
parameter a for all samples is determined using the
formula a = d(h2 + k2 + l2)1/2. The lattice parameters of 8.118, 8.106,
and 8.125 Å are obtained for the MCo2O4 rods where M = Co, Zn, and Ni, respectively. The (311) peak was
used for the calculation of the mean crystallite sizes (D) of the samples by the Debye–Scherrer formula31D = kλ/β
cos θ, where β is the full width at half-maximum of the
(311) peak, θ is the Bragg angle, k is the
structure factor, and λ = 0.1541 nm is the wavelength. The mean
crystallite sizes of 30, 17, and 8 nm are obtained for MCo2O4, M = Co, Zn, and Ni, respectively, which are confirmed
by TEM analysis.

The morphology of the samples was investigated
by SEM. The SEM
images of the MCo2O4 (M = Co, Zn, and Ni) samples
obtained at 450 °C are shown in Figure 2a–c. Bundles of porous rods (log-like
structure) are observed for CoCo2O4 and ZnCo2O4 (Figure 2a,b), whereas well-defined needlelike rods are observed for
NiCo2O4 (Figure 2c). The length of these rods is found to be 5–10
μm for all samples. Figure 3a–f reveals the microstructural features of
these samples investigated by TEM. The TEM images (Figure 3a–c) show the agglomerated
rods (thickness from few nanometers to few microns) with a length
of several micrometers. The SAED patterns (inset of Figure 3d–f) clearly reveal
bright spots on the diffraction rings, indicating the nanostructure
of the samples. The electron diffraction rings represent the (111),
(220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) planes of the spinel structure
which is in good agreement with the XRD results. Further, HR-TEM images
(Figure 3d–f)
also reveal that the rods are built by self-assembled nanoparticle
aggregates which are well-interconnected to form stable mesoporous
rods. The interplanar distances of MCo2O4 mesoporous
rods (inset of Figure 3d–f) are found to be 0.245 nm for CoCo2O4, 0.244 nm for ZnCo2O4, and 0.245 nm for NiCo2O4 which matches well with the (311) plane of the
spinel structure. The pore size distributions and specific surface
area for the MCo2O4 rods were evaluated using
the BET theory and the BJH model. The N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms and pore size distribution data for MCo2O4 (M = Zn and Ni) are shown in Figure 4. The BET data of CoCo2O4 are not included for the sake of clarity. The calculated BET specific
surface areas of CoCo2O4, ZnCo2O4, and NiCo2O4 were about 24, 54, and
62 m2 g–1, respectively. The average
pore sizes of CoCo2O4, ZnCo2O4, and NiCo2O4 are 31, 15, and 9 nm,
respectively. It clearly reveals the mesoporous structure of the samples.
The large surface area can effectively enhance the electrochemical
reaction and allow better penetration of the electrolyte for the faradaic
reaction.

Raman spectroscopy is used to
acquire details about the structural
changes, lattice disorder, and compositional changes owing to the
divalent cation replacement in the mesoporous cobaltite. Figure 5 shows the Raman
spectra of the mesoporous spinel-type rods. Raman active bands at
194, 482, 522, 618, and 690 cm–1 corresponding to
F2g, Eg, 2F2g, and A1g modes are identified for single-crystal Co3O4 by Hadjiev et al.,32 whereas Raman active
vibration peaks at 186, 460, 505, and 659 cm–1 corresponding
to F2g, Eg, F2g, and A1g modes, respectively, are reported for urchin-like structured NiCo2O4 by Umeshbabu et al.33 The shifts in the Raman active mode of urchin-like structured NiCo2O4 in comparison to those of single-crystal Co3O4 were ascribed to Ni substitution for Co and
the presence of the nanostructure. In this work, the vibrational peaks
of mesoporous CoCo2O4 rods are observed at 478,
520, 617, and 688 cm–1 corresponding to Eg, F2g, F2g, and A1g modes, respectively,
which are in agreement with the literature.34 For NiCo2O4 rods, the vibration peaks are
observed at 475, 516, 613, and 684 cm–1 corresponding
again to Eg, F2g, F2g, and A1g modes, respectively. Similarly, the vibrational peaks of
ZnCo2O4 rods are observed at 466, 510, 604,
and 678 cm–1. The vibrational peaks are shifted
toward lower wavenumbers with divalent cation substitution Co >
Ni
> Zn in the spinel structure. This result further supports the
presence
of the cubic spinel-type structure for the fabricated mesoporous rods.

The surface elemental composition and the component’s
oxidation
state of the different mesoporous rods were investigated by XPS, and
their respective metal 2p spectra are shown in Figure 6. The corresponding main O 1s peaks at 530.3,
529.9, and 529.8 eV are attributed to the spinel lattice oxygen of
CoCo2O4, ZnCo2O4, and
NiCo2O4, respectively, and are shown in Figure
S1 of the Supporting Information together
with the C 1s spectra to prove the only weak topmost contamination.35−37

Co3+ peaks and satellites: shaded and Co2+ peaks
and satellites: gray; (b,d) Zn2+ tetrahedral coordination:
gray and octahedral coordination: shaded; and (f) Ni peaks: shaded
and loss features: gray.

For the transition-metal 2p multiplet fitting, we agreed
to use
only the 2p3/2 component of the spin–orbit doublet
justified by the sufficient energy gap between both peaks. To address
the complex multiplet structure of the third-row transition-metal
photoelectron and loss feature multiplets, we follow the approaches
of Biesinger and Grosvenor for the interpretation of the Co and Ni
multiplets.38,39 In particular, we used templates
of pure Co2+ and Co3+ 2p multiplets to describe
the CoCo2O4 compound in Figure 6a. Because of the strong overlap of the respective
photoelectron peaks, the sole attempt to distinguish between the two
binding states is to utilize the respective satellite features around
785.6 eV (Co2+) and 789.7 eV (Co3+) as guiding
peaks for the respective multiplets. This is corroborated by the pure
Co3+ multiplet of ZnCo2O4 in Figure 6c. The overall Co
quantification for CoCo2O4 finally results in
a Co3+ amount of 62 at % which is close to the expected
content. The Co 2p spectrum of ZnCo2O4 in Figure 6c reveals, as already
stated above, a pure Co3+ multiplet justified by the absence
of the Co2+ satellite. By contrast, the corresponding Zn
2p3/2 multiplet in Figure 6d results in two Zn2+ components at 1021.4
and 1022.8 eV which indicate Zn2+ in tetrahedral and octahedral
oxygen coordination, respectively.40,41 This is supported
by the fact that in nanostructured oxide spinels often an almost random
arrangement of the different cations on the tetrahedral and octahedral
cation sites is observed.42,43 The chemical state
of Zn2+ is additionally corroborated by the Zn LMM Auger
peaks in Figure 6b.

The Co 2p spectrum of NiCo2O4 in Figure 6e was fitted according
to the procedure described for the CoCo2O4 compound.
In conclusion, we have to consider the presence of a certain amount
of Co2+ because of the pronounced satellite feature at
785.4 eV. Finally, the Co3+ concentration amounts to 59%
of the overall Co content. The corresponding Ni 2p spectrum in Figure 6f was fitted using
an adapted template used in the study of Grosvenor et al. and checked
by reference measurements using pure NiO (not shown);27 as for Ni2+ in pure NiO, the ratio between the
peaks at 855.9 and at 854.3 eV amounts to 1.5. In the case of the
NiCo2O4 rods, this ratio is about 2.8; hence,
in conclusion, a distinct amount of Ni3+ has to be considered
because the main peak for Ni3+ is expected at around 856.0
eV. However, because of the lack of appropriate Ni3+ reference
materials and, therefore, an unavailable template for the respective
multiplet, this cannot be assigned unambiguously. Nevertheless, the
assumption seems to be evidenced by the corresponding amount of Co2+, suggesting some Co/Ni exchange. From the results described
above, the following conclusions can be drawn: (i) The Co3+ content of 62% found for CoCo2O4 is to some
extent smaller than 2/3 and might hint at some oxygen deficiency.
(ii) NiCo2O4 shows mixed valences for both the
transition-metal elements which compensate each other. (iii) ZnCo2O4 shows site exchange for Zn and Co, that is,
a partially inverse spinel. The Co2+/Co3+ and
Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couples are the major active
sites for the electrochemical reactions.

The CV of MCo2O4 (M = Co, Zn, and Ni) mesoporous
rods with 6 M KOH as the electrolyte is performed to evaluate the
pseudocapacitor performance. Figure 7a–c shows the CV curves for the MCo2O4 mesoporous rods in a potential window of 0.0–0.6
V versus Ag/AgCl at different scan rates. The well-defined oxidation
and reduction peaks are observed in the cathodic and anodic scans
in all CV curves, revealing that the capacitance of the mesoporous
spinel-type metal oxide working electrodes is primarily based on the
redox reaction.16 All CV curves show an
almost identical shape, and the redox current increases with the scan
rate. The peaks in the CV are ascribed to the electrochemical redox
reactions associated with M–O/M–O–OH (M = Co,
Zn, and Ni).44 The most probable electrochemical
redox reactions can be described for the present mesoporous rods in
the alkaline electrolyte solution as 1   2

NiCo2O4. (d) Anodic peak current density against
the square root of the scan rate for mesoporous MCo2O4 rods.

With increasing scan
rate, the anodic and cathodic peak position
is shifted toward higher and lower potentials, respectively, which
indicates the faradaic reaction.12 The
charge stored in the mesoporous electrode is given by the area enclosed
by the CV curve. The Coulombic efficiency (η) is represented
as the ratio between the area of oxidation and reduction peaks. The
η of mesoporous MCo2O4 rods, where M =
Co, Zn, and Ni, estimated from the CV curves at 5 mV/s (scan rate)
is 95.23%. The η is enhanced up to 97.78% for a scan rate of
100 mV/s. The specific capacitance (Cs) of the mesoporous rods is determined from the CV data by using
the following equation9 3  where m is the mass of the
active material, ν is the scan rate, (E2 – E1) is the potential
window, and i(E) is the current
at each potential. The Cs values of these
mesoporous rods are found to be 1846 F g–1 for CoCo2O4, 1983 F g–1 for ZnCo2O4, and 2118 F g–1 for NiCo2O4 at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. The Cs values decrease to 1665 F g–1 for CoCo2O4, 1738 F g–1 for ZnCo2O4, and 1911 F g–1 for NiCo2O4 at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. It reveals that ion diffusion
is restricted in the surface of the active materials at higher scan
rate. Thus, the electric double layer capacitance dominates over the
pseudocapacitance at higher scan rate. The faradaic reaction dominates
at low scan rates (<10 mV/s) which leads to the enhancement of
the specific capacitance because of the more effective usage of the
active material in the working electrode. The diffusion of OH– ions is the rate-controlling process which is confirmed
by observing a linear relation between the anodic peak current and
the square root of the scan rate, as shown in Figure 7d. Among these mesoporous MCo2O4 rods (M = Co, Zn, and Ni), NiCo2O4 shows the highest specific capacitance because of larger surface
area with smaller pore size.

To further investigate the specific
capacitance of these samples,
GCD experiments were performed. Figure 8a shows the GCD curves of the working electrodes at
a given current density. The asymmetric shape of the GCD curves represents
the faradaic nature of the materials. The CoCo2O4 electrode is quickly charged to 0.4 V at 3.57 A g–1 in comparison with the charging time of ZnCo2O4 (3.52 A g–1) and NiCo2O4 (3.30 A g–1) electrodes (51, 160, and 130 s for
M = Co, Zn, and Ni, respectively). According to the BJH study, the
pore size of the CoCo2O4 rods is higher than
that of the other two samples and it facilitates ion movements into
the electrode for the electrochemical reaction or screening of the
external electric field. While comparing the discharge time of the
electrodes (53, 71, and 94 s for M = Co, Zn, and Ni, respectively),
the NiCo2O4 electrode shows the higher discharge
capacity because of the larger surface area in comparison to the other
two electrodes. This large surface area of the electrode allows to
store more charge or to access more active sites for the redox reaction.

curves of working electrodes (mesoporous MCo2O4 rods; M = Co, Zn, and Ni) at a given current density.

CoCo2O4, (c) ZnCo2O4,
and (d) NiCo2O4 at different current densities,
and the inset figure shows the specific capacitance vs current density
obtained from the discharge curves.

To determine the practical specific capacitance of these
electrodes,
the charge/discharge measurements at different current densities were
carried out, as shown in Figure 8b–d. All discharge curves exhibit three different
regimes: (i) initially, a rapid potential drop occurs owing to internal
resistance, (ii) a slow potential decay at intermediate times caused
by the faradaic redox reaction, and (iii) finally, a fast potential
decay owing to the electric double layer capacitance. Cs is estimated from the discharge curves by using the
following expression9 4  where I, Δt, m, and Δv are
the applied
current, discharge time, active mass, and potential difference, respectively.
The Cs values of CoCo2O4, ZnCo2O4, and NiCo2O4 are 473 F g–1 at 3.57 A g–1, 590 F g–1 at 3.52 A g–1, and
788 F g–1 at 3.30 A g–1, respectively.
The Cs of NiCo2O4 decreases with the current density, as shown in the inset of Figure 8d, and similar features
are observed for the other samples too. The Cs of the NiCo2O4 electrode is superior
in comparison with that of the other two electrodes. Considering the
BET and HR-TEM results, the larger surface area and highly porous
nature of NiCo2O4 are anticipated to result
in the higher Cs. A good cycling stability
is vital for real capacitor applications. Therefore, we have carried
out continuous GCD measurement for about 2000 cycles, as shown in Figure 9. A few continuous
GCD cycles for NiCo2O4 at a current density
of 3.30 A g–1 is shown in the inset of Figure 9. After 2000 cycles,
the MCo2O4 electrodes where M = Co, Zn, and
Ni are maintained at 94.93, 95.94, and 97.11% of their initial Cs, respectively. It reveals that the mesoporous
spinel-type metal oxide rods show the desirable stability in the 6
M KOH electrolyte during long-term cycling with excellent cycling
efficiency. In Table 1, we summarized the Cs values of the
samples from the present work in comparison with the Cs of 1D MCo2O4 where M = Co, Zn,
and Ni obtained by the template route in the literature.24,45−48 The Cs value of the present work is
superior to some pioneering 1D MCo2O4 electrodes
obtained by template routes. In particular, the porous nanorods are
built by the aggregates of nanoparticles, and thus, the electrolyte
can easily penetrate through the porous 1D structure which helps for
efficient redox reactions during the faradaic charge storage mechanism.
Hence, the majority of the electroactive sites of the 1D porous MCo2O4 electrodes are utilized efficiently, resulting
in higher specific capacitance with better cycling efficiency.

The electrochemical
impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements
were carried out before and after GCD cycles to investigate the charge-transfer
reaction mechanism of the electrodes. Figure 10a–c shows the complex impedance plots
of working electrodes before and after 2000 cycles at a given current
density. The following features are observed in the complex impedance
spectra. An offset in the real part of impedance (Rs) at high frequencies represents a sum of intrinsic resistance
of the active material, contact resistance, and electrolyte resistance.
A small semicircle is observed at high to intermediate frequencies.
It represents the faradaic charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrochemical reactions between the electrode
and the electrolyte. A straight line is observed in the low-frequency
region which originates from the diffusive resistance of anions (OH–) from the liquid electrolyte to the solid oxide electrode
surface. To quantify the bulk resistance and faradaic charge-transfer
resistance of the electrodes before and after the GCD cycles, the
EIS data were analyzed with electrical equivalent circuits (ECs) using
ZView (version 2.70) software. A representative EC is shown in the
inset of Figure 10d. In the EC, Rs, Rct, W, CPEdl, and CPEps refer to the bulk resistance, faradaic charge-transfer resistance,
Warburg impedance, constant phase element of double layer capacitance,
and pseudocapacitance, respectively. All electrodes show almost the
same bulk resistance before and after the GCD cycles, as shown in Figure 10d. However, the
bulk resistance of the NiCo2O4 electrode is
slightly higher than that of the other two electrodes (Figure 10d). It might be caused by
a larger grain boundary resistance between grains as expected because
of the smaller grain sizes. The charge-transfer resistance of the
CoCo2O4 and ZnCo2O4 electrodes
increased after the GCD cycling, indicating that the fading of the
faradaic electrochemical reaction may result from the formation of
inactive sites or a loss of adhesion of some active material to the
current collector. The resistance Rct of
the NiCo2O4 electrode increased slightly after
cycling. This could be the major benefit of this electrode which possesses
a highly porous structure that leads to fast ion/electron transfers
at the electrode/electrolyte interface.

3 Conclusions
The spinel-type MCo2O4 (M = Co, Zn, and Ni)
mesoporous rods were successfully synthesized by a simple solvothermal
route without surfactants and a post-annealing approach. The length
of these mesoporous rods is found to be of several micrometers. The
XRD measurements reveal a phase-pure spinel-type crystal structure
with lattice parameters of a = 8.118, 8.106, and
8.125 Å for MCo2O4, M = Co, Zn, and Ni,
respectively. The HR-TEM study reveals that the mesoporous rods are
built by self-assembled nanoparticle aggregates which are well-interconnected
to form stable mesoporous rods. The spinel-type MCo2O4 rods exhibit high specific capacitances of 1846 F g–1 (CoCo2O4), 1983 F g–1 (ZnCo2O4), and 2118 F g–1 (NiCo2O4) at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. The mesoporous MCo2O4, M = Co, Zn, and Ni, rods show an excellent
cycling stability with 94.93% at 3.57 A g–1, 95.94%
at 3.52 A g–1, and 97.11% at 3.30 A g–1, respectively, of their initial Cs even
after 2000 cycles. The mesoporous spinel-type metal oxides reveal
the desirable stability in the alkaline electrolyte during long-term
cycling with excellent cycling efficiency.

4 Materials
and Methods
The spinel-type MCo2O4 (M
= Co, Zn, and Ni)
mesoporous rods were fabricated by a simple solvothermal approach
without the assistance of surfactants. The NiCo2O4 mesoporous rods were prepared by mixing 1 mmol Ni(SO4)2·7H2O (Loba Chemie) and 2 mmol CoSO4·7H2O (Loba Chemie) and dissolving this mixture
in EG and deionized water (3:1 v/v ratio) under magnetic stirring.
H2C2O4 (3 mmol, Loba Chemie) was
added to this solution slowly under continuous stirring for about
1 h at room temperature (RT). The final mixture was poured into an
autoclave (Teflon-lined stainless steel) with a volume of 100 mL and
hydrothermally treated at 140 °C for 24 h in an oven. The products
were collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water several
times, and dried in air at 80 °C for 10 h. The ZnCo2O4 rods were prepared by mixing 2 mmol CoSO4·7H2O and 1 mmol Zn(SO4)2·7H2O (Loba Chemie), and the Co3O4 mesoporous
rods were synthesized by taking 3 mmol CoSO4·7H2O, while the other steps were identical to those of the NiCo2O4 rods. Finally, the product precursors were heated
at 450 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 and cooled down slowly to RT.

The powder XRD data of the samples
were acquired with a MiniFlex-II
(Rigaku) diffractometer with λCu = 1.541 Å operating
at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. The TGA–DTA were
performed using a simultaneous thermal analyzer (Hitachi, STA7000
series) at temperatures from 30 to 1000 °C at a heating rate
of 5 °C min–1 in air. The microstructural properties
were analyzed by SEM (JEOL JSM-6390LV) and TEM (Tecnai G220 S-Twin and Jeol JEM 2100) with SAED. The specific surface area
and pore size distributions were evaluated according to the BET theory
and BJH model, respectively (Quantachrome, QUADRASORB SI). The Raman
spectra were measured with a Renishaw laser Raman spectrometer.

The XPS measurements were performed using a K-Alpha XPS+ instrument
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, East Grinstead, UK). Data acquisition and
processing using the Thermo Avantage software is described elsewhere.27 The mesoporous rods were analyzed using a microfocused,
monochromated Al Kα X-ray source with 30–400 μm
spot size. The K-Alpha charge compensation system was employed during
the analysis, using electrons of 8 eV energy and low-energy argon
ions to prevent any localized charge build-up. The spectra were fitted
with one or more Voigt profiles. All spectra were referenced to the
C 1s peak of hydrocarbon at a 285.0 eV binding energy controlled by
means of the well-known photoelectron peaks of metallic Cu, Ag, and
Au. For intense peaks and/or peaks clearly evidenced by the peak shape,
the binding energy uncertainty was around ±0.1 eV. In the case
of weak peaks and no direct justification by the peak shape, the uncertainty
was set to ±0.2 eV. The analyzer transmission function, Scofield’s
sensitivity factors,28 and effective attenuation
lengths (EALs) for photoelectrons were applied for quantification.
The EALs were calculated using the standard TPP-2M formalism.29

The electrode slurry was prepared by mixing
the MCo2O4 (M = Co, Zn, and Ni) mesoporous rods
(80 wt %), activated
charcoal carbon black (SD FINE-CHEM, 10 wt %), polyvinylidene fluoride
(Alfa Aesar, 10 wt %) with N-methyl pyrrolidinone
(Loba Chemie) as a solvent. Initially, the Ni mesh (Alfa Aesar) substrate
was cleaned by ultrasonication. Then, the slurry of the electrode
materials was pasted on the cleaned Ni mesh substrate as a working
electrode, and it was dried at 80 °C for 24 h. Finally, the working
electrode was compacted with a hydraulic press (load of 5 t). The
working electrode area was 1 cm2 (geometrical area) with
an active electrode mass of ∼1 mg. The electrochemical performance
was investigated by CV, GCD cycling, and impedance spectroscopy in
a three-electrode configuration. KOH (6 M) was used as an electrolyte.
A potentiostat/galvanostat (Biologic, SP-240) was used for the electrochemical
measurements with EC lab software. Ag/AgCl was used as a reference
electrode and a platinum rod was used as a counter electrode.
