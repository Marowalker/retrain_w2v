In an attempt
to investigate the influence of many variables on the synthesis of
lanthanide coordination polymers (Ln-CPs) assembled from the ligand
3,3-dimethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, three different Ln-CPs
with formulae [La9(μ4-dcd)12(μ3-O)2(H)]n (1), [Gd4(μ4-dcd)6(H2O)]n (2),
and [Gd2(μ3-OH)2(μ3-dcd)(μ2-ac)2(H2O)]n (3) (dcd = 3,3-dimethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylate,
ac = acetate) have been hydrothermally synthesized and structurally
characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectrum, thermal analysis,
powder X-ray diffraction, and single X-ray diffraction techniques. 1 represents the first report of the three-dimensional (3D)
Ln-CPs based on nonanuclear lanthanide clusters, although it shows
extremely low gas uptakes. 2 exhibits one of the previously
reported 3D lanthanide wheel cluster-like frameworks. 3 characterizes a novel one-dimensional ladder-like chain [Gd4(OH)4]n decorated with
mixed ligand ribbons. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility
measurement reveals that the shortest Gd···Gd distance
in 3 induces the antiferromagnetic interactions between
adjacent Gd3+ cations within the hydroxyl-bridged binuclear
unit. Remarkably, magnetic investigation for 2 indicates
a unique metamagnetic transition from the antiferromagnet to ferromagnet.
Furthermore, magnetic studies for 2 also exhibit the
presence of significant magnetocaloric effect with a large magnetic
entropy change.

Introduction
Used as novel porous materials, lanthanide coordination polymers
(Ln-CPs) are often composed of lanthanide metal centers or clusters
connected with organic ligands. Recently, there has been a growing
interest in exploring Ln-CPs because of their unique and interesting
physical and chemical properties compared with transition-metal coordination
polymers.1,2 Particularly, the highly coordinated lanthanides
usually give rise to condensed framework structures in the microporous
range, which are beneficial in gas storage and separation.3,4 Apart from the characteristics of microporosity, Ln-CPs also possess
unique properties derived from f electrons such as magnetism and luminescence.5,6 Therefore, the synthesis of highly crystalline Ln-CPs with diverse
structures is always challenging in chemistry and materials science
fields.7−10

From a synthesis perspective, the design and
construction of Ln-CPs are based on the judicious selection of ligands
and metal ions. Among the different lanthanide cations, the Gd3+ ion is the best candidate for constructing magnetic Ln-CPs.
Taking this character into account, structural characterization and
magnetic studies for gadolinium-based coordination polymers have been
widely reported in the recent literature.11−13 However, the exploration of magneto-structural
correlations for the gadolinium-based coordination polymers is still
unsatisfactory. Many experimental data are also needed in order to
assess these aspects adequately.

Comparably, reasonable selection
of the ligands as linkers can be viewed as a well-suited way to synthesize
Ln-CPs with diverse structures. Numerous Ln-CPs are usually assembled
from aromatic carboxylic acids and their derivatives because the oxygen
atoms have affinities to lanthanide ions. However, few of the studies
focus on the alicyclic carboxylic acid (or its derivative) so far.14 Recently, we have adopted one of the alicyclic
carboxylate (3,3′-dimethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylate, denoted
as dcd) ligands as the organic linking ligand to construct lanthanide
metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) showing attractive topologies
and highly sensitive responses to sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate.15 The dcd ligand is a favorable organic linker
source for the construction of Ln-CPs because of its special clip-like
structure. On the other hand, although many Ln-CPs have been synthesized
up to now, the targeted syntheses of prospective Ln-CPs are still
difficult owing to the subtle synthesis requirements. Many factors
influence the final structure, including different ratios and raw
materials as well as the variable reaction conditions.

The basic
considerations of our synthetic strategy are to study the influence
of many variables on the final composition and structures for Ln-CPs
assembled from the ligand 3,3-dimethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic
acid. By blending the reactants 6,6-dimethyl-3-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,4-dione
and La2O3, the crystal product of [La9(μ4-dcd)12(μ3-O)2(H)]n (1) was formed
hydrothermally. In order to get other crystal lanthanide products,
we selected the same amounts of the mixture of 6,6-dimethyl-3-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,4-dione
and Ln2O3 (Ln = Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd) as the starting
reactants to further perform this investigation according to the similar
synthetic pathway with 1. Unexpectedly, no crystal products
isostructural with 1 can be found perhaps because the
ion radius of Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, or
Gd3+ is smaller than that of La3+. Apart from
the unspecific white precipitates for other lanthanides, only one
crystal product of [Gd4(μ4-dcd)6(H2O)]n (2) was
obtained. This experiment illustrates that the lanthanide contraction
effect may play a prominent instructing part in constructing different
Ln-CPs. Furthermore, it is known that the ingenious study of Gd-based
coordination polymers should contribute to their magneto-structural
correlations. Considering all these, we continue to try other synthetic
conditions by choosing the same amount of 6,6-dimethyl-3-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,4-dione
and Gd(ac)3·4H2O together with NaOH to
synthesize the crystal lanthanide products similar with 1. Unfortunately, one crystal product of [Gd2(μ3-OH)2(μ3-dcd)(μ2-ac)2(H2O)]n (3) was synthesized finally. The results show that the synthesized
diverse Ln-CPs from the ligand 3,3-dimethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic
acid are variable depending on the different controlled synthetic
conditions, which afford us new opportunities for studying various
Ln-CPs with interesting structures and properties in future. As a
contribution to the elucidation of structures of Ln-CPs, as well as
to better understand the nature of the physical property in these
systems, we present herein the synthesis, crystal structures, gas
adsorption, and magnetic properties of the diverse Ln-CPs built from
dcd ligands, [La9(μ4-dcd)12(μ3-O)2(H)]n (1), [Gd4(μ4-dcd)6(H2O)]n (2),
and [Gd2(μ3-OH)2(μ3-dcd)(μ2-ac)2(H2O)]n (3) (dcd = 3,3-dimethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylate,
ac = acetate).

Results and Discussion
Structural Descriptions
[La9(μ4-dcd)12(μ3-O)2(H)]n (1)
Single X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that compound 1 crystallizes in the trigonal space group of R3̅. It is a neutral three-dimensional (3D) Ln-CP assembled
from nonanuclear lanthanum clusters featuring a double-nested trigonal
antiprismatic configuration. Considering the charge balance, the asymmetry
unit for 1 contains two crystallographically independent
La3+ cations, two dcd ligands, one bridge-linking oxygen,
and one balanced hydrogen atom. Besides the normal occupancies, it
should be noted that the occupancies for La1, O9, and H9 are 1/2,
1/3, and 1/6, respectively.

Figure 1 shows that each of the La1 atoms is 10-coordinated
with 10 oxygen atoms from 6 different dcd ligands building a distorted
bicapped square antiprism. However, the environment of La2 is best
described as a distorted monocapped square antiprism, which is defined
by nine O atoms from five different dcd ligands and one oxygen bridge
group. The bond lengths of La1–Ocarboxylate and
La2–Ocarboxylate are in the ranges of 2.5279(33)–2.7734(27)
and 2.4995(31)–2.7548(22) Å, respectively. Compared with
the bond lengths of La1–Ocarboxylate and La2–Ocarboxylate, it is noticeable that a smaller La2–Obridge bond length of 2.3692(11) Å is presented in a trinuclear
unit formed by the ligation between one μ3-O bridge
group and three La2 ions. Furthermore, two crystallographically independent
dcd ligands can be found in the asymmetry unit of 1.
Both of them exhibit μ4-bridging linkers and adopt
the coordination modes of μ4-η1:η2:η2:η2 (for carboxylates
with C1 and C2, denoted as L1) and μ4-η1:η2:η1:η2 (for carboxylates with C3 and C4, denoted as L2), as shown in Figure 1.

Structurally speaking, each μ3-O9 group
ligates three La2 ions to form an incipient [La3(μ3-O)]4+ core with a La2···La2 distance
of 3.9515(5) Å. By sharing the joints of adjacent La1 ions, three
ligands adopting the L1 coordination mode join the [La3(μ3-O)]4+ core and three additional
La1 ions, giving rise to a La27 wheel cluster two-dimensional
(2D) layer with an entity of [La4.5(μ3-O)(dcd)3]5.5+ (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1). The distance between the
two parallel layers is 3.8083(1) Å. At the same time, every two
parallel 2D wheel cluster layers are pillared by a bunch of six dcd
ligands adopting the L2 coordination mode to give rise
to a final microporous 3D lanthanum framework containing an entity
of [La9(μ3-O)2(dcd)12]−, as shown in Figures S2 and 2a. On the other hand, by considering
the dcd ligands, bridge-linking oxygen atoms and La3+ ions
as nodes, the microporous 3D lanthanum framework for 1 can also be simplified into an unusual (3,4,4,6,6)-connected 5-nodal
network with (411·64)6(43·63)6 (43)2(44·62)6 (46·128·14)3 topology, as shown in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 (a) Microporous
3D lanthanum framework shown in the model of wires/sticks and (b)
topology for the equivalent 3D lanthanum framework.

Notably, the entity
of [La9(μ3-O)2(dcd)12]− should be neutral according to the charge-balanced
principle. In order to balance the charged entity of [La9(μ3-O)2(dcd)12]−, one resonant hydrogen atom may be encapsulated in the charged entity
center. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the bond length of La2–Obridge is 2.3692(11) Å, which is obviously smaller than
those of La1–Ocarboxylate [2.5279(33)–2.7734(27)
Å] and La2–Ocarboxylate [(2.4995(31)–2.7548(22)
Å]. Considering the charge balance and relatively short distance,
it is reasonable to average one resonant hydrogen atom to two symmetry-related
μ3-O9 bridge-linking groups, resulting in a neutral
entity of [La9(μ3-O)2H(dcd)12] finally.

By closer inspection, two kinds of the holes
including hexagonal-prismatic metal coordination cages (MCCs) and
close-packed one-dimensional (1D) open trigonal channels can be found
in the microporous 3D lanthanum framework containing the entities
of [La9(μ3-O)2(dcd)12]n. As shown in Figure 3a, six La2 ions and dcd ligands adopting
two coordination modes constitute one of the hexagonal-prismatic MCCs
with an inner diameter of 3.81 Å. Namely, six μ4-dcd ligands (see Figure 3a, labeled mauve color) first hook the peripheral
positions of the Ln6 core from the top down, giving rise
to a primal cage-like framework. Then, the primal cage-like framework
is further decorated by six μ3-dcd ligands (see Figure 3a, labeled green
color) through the clamping coordination. Seeing from the coordination
sites for the remnant La ions, both La1 and La2 ions are evidently
unsaturated. Both of them are finally bridged by other dcd ligands,
resulting in one of the close-packed 1D open trigonal channels with
aninner diameter of 8.67 Å along the c axis
(see Figure 3b).

one of the hexagonal-prismatic MCCs with the inner diameter of 3.81
Å and (b) one of the close-packed trigonal channels with the
inner diameter of 8.67 Å along the c axis.

It is remarkable that the 3D lanthanum framework displays a nonanuclear
lanthanum cluster with double-nested trigonal antiprismatic configuration
(see Figure 4a,b).
As far as we know, although many of the isolated nonanuclear lanthanum
clusters are synthesized,16−21 none of the 3D Ln-CPs based on the nonanuclear
lanthanum clusters has been reported so far. In order to understand
the structure well, topological analysis is further performed to the
3D lanthanum framework. By simply considering [La9(μ3-O)2H(dcd)12]n units as nodes, the 3D framework for 1 can be
topologically transformed into a uninodal six-connected cubic motif
with a cell length of 14.016 Å, as shown in Figure 4c.

antiprismatic configuration, and (c) primitive cubic topology network

Considering that the
microporous 3D lanthanum framework contains both the hexagonal-prismatic
MCCs and close-packed trigonal channels, its porosity is performed
through the PLATON analysis.22 The results
showed that the effective free volume of the microporous 3D framework
is about 1130.4 Å3, comprising 13.7% of the crystal
volume (1130.4 out of 8237.3 Å3 in each cell unit).

[Gd4(μ4-dcd)6(H2O)]n (2)
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis for 2 shows that it is isostructural to our reported MOFs.15 Compound 2 features an incipient
triangular pyramidal [Gd4(COO)3] core (Figure 5a). Six units of
[Gd4(COO)3] are connected through one kind of
dcd ligands into a Gd24 wheel cluster containing the distances
of 4.0851(2), 6.7431(4), and 3.8727(2) Å for Gd1···Gd2,
Gd2···Gd2B, and Gd2B···Gd2C, respectively
(Figure 5c). By sharing
the nearby six units, the Gd24 wheel cluster unit can be
transformed into a wheel cluster layer. Through the −AB– alternations along the c axis,
the parallel Eu24 wheel cluster layers are pillared by
the other dcd ligands, generating a final microporous 3D framework
(see Figure 5b).

cluster. Symmetry codes: A (1 – y, x – y, z), B (1
– x + y, 1 – x, z), C (1 + x – y, x, 1 – z).

[Gd2(μ3-OH)2(μ3-dcd)(μ2-ac)2(H2O)]n (3)
The single-crystal X-ray diffraction study shows that 3 crystallizes in the triclinic system, and the space group
is P1̅. Evidently, two Gd3+ ions
bridged by two hydroxyl groups, one dcd ligand, two acetate ligands,
and one coordinated water molecule can be found in the asymmetry unit.
As illustrated in Figure 6, with a distorted monocapped square antiprism, both of the
crystallographically independent Gd3+ ions are nine-coordinated.
The coordination environment for Gd1 is constituted by nine oxygen
atoms from two acetate and two dcd ligands and three hydroxyl groups.
However, for Gd2, nine oxygen atoms come from one dcd and two acetate
ligands, three hydroxyl groups, and one coordinated water molecule.
The bond lengths of Gd–Ocarboxylate, Gd–Oacetate, and Gd–Ohydroxyl are in the range
of 2.3567(42)–2.5768(49), 2.3898(50)–2.7250(48), and
2.3917(44)–2.4671(45) Å, respectively.

well as Gd ions in 2. Symmetry codes: A (1 – x, −y, 1 – z), B (−1 + x, y, z), C (2 – x, −y, 1 – z), D (1 + x, y, z).

As far as
the ligands are concerned, only one crystallographically independent
dcd can be found in 3 (see the aubergine parts in Figure 6). It can be used
as a μ4-bridge linking ligand with two carboxylate
groups adopting the μ2-η2:η1-chelate-bridging coordination modes. However, there are two
crystallographically independent acetate ligands, which exhibit two
different coordination modes: μ2-η2:η1-chelate-bridging mode and μ2-η1:η1-bis-monodentate mode (see
the blue and green parts in Figure 6).

It deserves to be noted that each of the two
crystallographically independent hydroxyl oxygen atoms (O9 and O10)
adopts the μ3-bridging mode to link three neighboring
Gd3+ ions with the distances of 4.0577(5), 3.7115(5), and
3.9328(5) Å for Gd2···Gd2A, Gd2···Gd1,
and Gd1···Gd1C, respectively, giving an infinite ladder-like
chain with the [Ln4(OH)4] cluster unit (see Figure 7a). Through the bridge-linking
ligands μ3-dcd and μ2-ac, these
tetranuclear cluster units are further connected by carboxylic groups
into a 1D Gd-hydroxyl ladder-like chain decorated with the mixed ligand
ribbons, as illustrated in Figures 7b–c and 8a.

with dcd ligands, and (c) ladder-like chain decorated with ac ligands.

equivalent topology framework for the 1D ladder-like chain.

Topologically,
both dcd and acetate ligands as well as hydroxyl groups could be viewed
as the linkers, and each Gd center serves as the connected node. As
shown in Figure 8b,
the equivalent 1D topology framework for 3 can be simplified
as a binodal (4,6)-connected motif, and the Schlafli symbol is (34·42) (35·45·53·62).

Thermogravimetric Analyses and Powder X-ray Diffraction Patterns
By using the polycrystalline samples 1 and 3, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in order to examine
their thermal stabilities (see Figure S3).

The TG curve of the sample 1 shows that there
is a plateau of stability from room temperature to 310 °C, and
no weight loss is observed before 310 °C, which indicates that 1 was anhydrous and stable up to 310 °C, being in accordance
with the single-crystal structure analysis for 1. From
310 to 640 °C, a weight loss of 53.87% should be ascribed to
the decomposition of the framework. Evidently, this value is well
consistent with the calculated one (53.56%) considering the final
product as La2O3. However, for compound 3, the first weight loss of 2.81% (calculated value 2.77%)
occurs in the temperature range 100–230 °C, which is due
to the escape of the coordinated water molecules. Furthermore, a plateau
of stability can also be found before 320 °C, demonstrating that
the framework of 3 has the ability to be stable up to
320 °C. Upon heating above 360 °C, the fast weight loss
of the framework occurred, giving rise to the final residue weight
of 50.6% (calculated value 50.1%) for Gd2O3.

For the as-synthesized samples 1, 2,
and 3, their powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns
were measured in the room temperature (see Figures S4–S6). Evidently, all measured PXRD patterns are consistent
with those simulated from single-crystal structural data, which indicate
that all compounds 1, 2, and 3 are obtained as a single phase, proving the purity of the bulk phases
further.

Gas Adsorption Studies for
Compound 1
Inspired by the microporous structures
with hexagonal-prismatic MCCs and close-packed 1D open trigonal channels
existed in the novel compound 1, it was selected to perform
the gas adsorption tests. The freshly isolated sample was first activated
at 210 °C under a dynamic vacuum, and its nearly intact crystal
state can be proved by the corresponding PXRD patterns (see Figure S7). Subsequently, different gas adsorption
measurements were carried out at a variety of temperatures. As shown
in Figures S8–S11, although an obvious
adsorption/desorption isotherm with a large hysteresis was observed
for N2 at 77 K, attempts to quantitatively evaluate the
mixed gas separation performance at 77 and 298 K were not successful
because of the extremely low uptakes of N2, H2, CO2, and CH4 in compound 1.

Considering the structural analysis above, it is clear that both
the hexagonal-prismatic MCCs indwelled in the 3D framework of 1 and channel-like space created by the regular arrangement
of the MCCs cannot be served as the main spaces for the gas adsorption,
perhaps because the inner spaces in 1 are not completely
accessible when the disordered methyl groups, cyclopropane frameworks,
and carboxylic groups appended on the open 1D channel partly block
the entrance of the gas molecules between the hexagonal-prismatic
MCCs and open 1D channels. All of these not only can be inferred from
the crystal structure but are also consistent with an extremely small
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area.

Magnetic Properties for Compounds 2 and 3
It is known that the strong magnetic
anisotropy of lanthanide ions is beneficial to the construction of
molecular magnetic materials.23−27 Considering
that the nature of magnetic interaction for Gd3+ ions can
be well estimated by the χMT versus T curve, the solid-state magnetic susceptibilities for compounds 2 and 3 were further measured. It should be pointed
out that although possessing the same structure with one of the reported
lanthanide wheel cluster organic frameworks,15 the magnetic behavior for 2 was not investigated previously.
In order to confirm the phase purity, the PXRD patterns for the crushed
crystalline samples of 2 and 3 were measured
(see Figures S5 and S6) before the magnetic
measurements. According to the crystal structures described above,
four Gd3+ cations in 2 are linked by three
carboxylate bridges, giving an incipient triangular pyramidal [Gd4(COO)3] core with the distances of 4.0851(2), 6.7431(4),
and 3.8727(2) Å for Gd1···Gd2, Gd2···Gd2B,
and Gd2B···Gd2C, respectively. However, for 3, four Gd3+ cations are connected through four hydroxyl
bridges into a cluster unit [Ln4(OH)4] with
the distances of 4.0577(5), 3.7115(5), and 3.9328(5) Å for Gd2···Gd2A,
Gd2···Gd1, and Gd1···Gd1C, respectively.
Evidently, the shortest Gd···Gd distance within [Ln4(OH)4] units for 3 is smaller than
that within [Eu4(COO)3] units for 2, which should be of interest for the study of magnetic interactions
between the adjacent Gd3+ cations. Consequently, compound 3 was first chosen as a representative to study its magnetic
susceptibility.

Figure 9 (denoted as red parts) shows the temperature dependence of
the χMT product for 3, where χM is the magnetic susceptibility per two
Gd3+ ions. It is evident that the value of χMT for 3 is equal to 15.69 cm3 mol–1 K at room temperature, which is as
expected for two magnetically isolated Gd3+ ions (χMT = 15.76 cm3 mol–1 K for SGd = 7/2 with g = 2.0). With decrease in the temperature, this value remains invariable
until 40 K. Proceeding to the next step, it continually decreases
to the value of 9.38 cm3 mol–1 K at 2.0
K. This feature obviously confirms the weak antiferromagnetic coupling
between the Gd3+ ions. For the measured magnetic data in
the range of 2.0–300 K, the Curie constant C = 15.742(3) cm3 mol–1 K and Weiss constant
θ = −0.66(3) K for 3 (see Figure 9 denoted as blue and green
parts) are obtained according to the Curie–Weiss fitting (χM = C/T – θ).
Similar to the observed χMT value
at room temperature (15.69 cm3 mol–1 K),
the C value for 3 is coincident with
the expected value for two Gd3+ ions. The profile of the
χMT versus T together
with the small negative θ value for 3 indicates
weak antiferromagnetic couplings between adjacent Gd3+ ions,
which is perhaps related with the shortest Gd···Gd
distance (3.7115 Å) within [Ln4(OH)4] units
for 3. All these features are similar to other widely
reported gadolinium-based coordination polymers.28−30

Figure 9 Temperature-dependent
χMT (red □) and χM–1 (blue ○) under a 1k Oe dc field
between 2.0 and 300 K for 3. The green line represents
the fitting result of the Curie–Weiss law (inset: the fitting
parameters).

Compared with 3, compound 2 displayed a quite different magnetic behavior. Figure 10 shows that the
χMT value at room temperature is
29.2 cm3 mol–1 K, which is little lower
than the expected value (31.52 cm3 mol–1 K) for four high-spin Gd3+ (SGd = 7/2 with g = 2.0) centers, thus indicating weak
antiferromagnetic Gd–Gd interactions in the triangular pyramidal
Gd4 unit. The temperature-dependent 1/χM obeys the Curie–Weiss law (χM = C/T – θ) with θ = 0.15
K (inset in Figure 10), and the positive θ value suggests the presence of weak ferromagnetic
interactions between the Gd3+ ions. Therefore, the weak
intermolecular ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings are synchronously
presented in 2, which can be partly confirmed by the
temperature-dependent χMT and χM. We know that if the χMT value increases with the decreasing temperature, it is certain that
the ferromagnetic coupling exists in lanthanide ions. As shown in Figure 10, the χMT value for 2 slowly increases
upon lowering the temperature and reaches a maximum (29.7 cm3 mol–1 K) at 70 K, determinately indicative of
the ferromagnetic Gd···Gd interactions. Then, the χMT value decreases sharply down to 27.3 cm3 mol–1 K at 2.0 K, perhaps being the evidence
of antiferromagnetic interactions according to Kahn’s model.31

magnetic coupling mode based on the Hamilton equation; the dots represent
the experiment values, and the solid lines are the best fitting results
based on the Hamilton equation for χM and the Curie–Weiss
equation for 1/χM.

Evidently, the ferromagnetic interactions
are tempered by the antiferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures.
On the other hand, the structural analysis reveals that a triangular
pyramidal Gd4 unit can be found in compound 2. Therefore, the magnetic interactions for the whole molecule can
be simplified as the isotropic Hamilton equation (eq 1) considering the magnetic coupling
in the Gd4 unit (inset in Figure 10) 1  J1 and J2 represent the equivalent
neighboring exchange parameters between two corresponding Gd3+ ions in the Gd4 unit. On the basis of the bond angle/distance
between the adjacent Gd3+ ions, the fitting of the χMT–T plot was further
carried out using the Origin 8.5 software package. The best fitting
result is g = 1.93, J1 = −0.14 cm–1, J2 = 0.14 cm–1 (T: 2.0–70
K) and g = 2.02, J1 =
−2.07 cm–1, J2 = 1.78 cm–1 (T: 70–300
K). This result further confirms the coexistence of weak ferro- and
antiferromagnetic interactions between the Gd3+ ions. Structural
determination for 2 has confirmed the existence of the
Gd4 units with the triangular pyramidal configuration and
two crystallographically independent dcd ligands. According to the
related reference,32 the bridging ligands
between the Gd4 units might play an important role in the
magnetic Gd···Gd interactions, being responsible for
this ferro- and antiferromagnetic coupling behavior. Quantitative
analyses for the coexistence of weak ferro- and antiferromagnetic
Gd···Gd interactions in 2 still need more
examples in future.

In the range of 0.0–7.0 T at 2.0–10.0
K, the field dependence of the magnetic measurements for 2 was also carried out (Figure 11a). It can be seen that the plot of M versus H shows a gradual increase with the increasing
field, showing a saturation value of 30 Nβ
for M at 2.0 K and 7.0 T, where N and β represent the Avogadro constant and Bohr magneton, respectively.
Considering the weak ferro- and antiferromagnetic coupling, the saturation
value for M is slightly larger than the expected
theoretical value of 28 Nβ for four uncorrelated
Gd3+ ions.

Figure 11 (a)
Field-dependent
experimental magnetization plots at different temperatures for 2 and (b) calculated changes of magnetic entropy for 2.

Furthermore, the Ln-CPs containing high
nuclear gadolinium clusters have recently attracted immense interest33,34 because they can be used as good candidates for designing efficient
magnetic refrigerant materials based on the Maxwell equation ΔSm(T)ΔH = ∫[∂M(T,H)/∂T]H dH and the experimental magnetization data.35,36 The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of the magnetic material is often
evaluated by using ΔSm. It can be
seen that with an increasing magnetic field and a decreasing temperature,
the observed −ΔSm values
for 2 increase (see Figure 11b), and a high value of 36.1 J kg–1 K–1 at 2.0 K and 7.0 T is obtained. Because of
the presence of ferro- and antiferromagnetic Gd···Gd
interactions in the deformed tetragonal Gd4 units or the
crystal field effects for the 3D structure, the maximal −ΔSm value observed for 2 is smaller
than the theoretical value of 43.7 J kg–1 K–1 (equivalent to 69.2 J·mol–1·K–1) for four uncoupled Gd3+ ions.
Although many complexes with the maximum entropy changes of higher
than 40 J kg–1 K–1 have been reported
in the literature,37−39 most
of them only belong to the high nuclear Gd clusters. Until recently,
a lanthanide cubane-based 3D MOF showing the maximal −ΔSm value of 64.0 J kg–1 K–1 (T = 3.0 K, ΔH = 9.0 T) has been synthesized via the self-assembly of the {Gd5} cluster with the squaric acid ligand.40 However, to the best of our knowledge, the −ΔSm value of 36.1 J kg–1 K–1 (T = 2.0 K, ΔH = 7.0 T) for 2 is still among the largest for the reported
high nuclear Gd wheel clusters, which is comparable to 39.66 J kg–1 K–1 (T = 2.5 K,
ΔH = 7.0 T) for {Gd36}41 and 40.6 J kg–1 K–1 (T = 2.0 K, ΔH = 7.0 T)
for {Gd16}42 but much larger
than 25.9 J kg–1 K–1 (T = 2.0 K, ΔH = 5.0 T) for {Gd18}43 and 26.6 J kg–1 K–1 (T = 2.2 K, ΔH = 7.0 T) for {Gd10}.44 Such a large MCE makes 2 a better magnetic refrigerant
containing {Gd24} wheel cluster.

Conclusions
Through rationally employing
one of the alicyclic dicarboxylic acids as the ligand, three different
Ln-CPs [La9(μ4-dcd)12(μ3-O)2(H)]n (1), [Gd4(μ4-dcd)6(H2O)]n (2), and [Gd2(μ3-OH)2(μ3-dcd)(μ2-ac)2(H2O)]n (3) have been synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction.
The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 presents a microporous 3D lanthanum framework with hexagonal-prismatic
MCCs, and the regular arrangement of each three MCCs also creates
many close-packed 1D open trigonal channels. The 3D lanthanum framework
for 1 also displays a nonanuclear lanthanum cluster with
double-nested trigonal antiprismatic configuration. This is the first
report of the 3D Ln-CPs based on the nonanuclear lanthanide clusters,
although attempts to quantitatively evaluate the mixed gas separation
performance were not successful because of its extremely low gas uptakes.
Compound 2 presents a 3D lanthanide wheel cluster-like
framework, which was previously synthesized by us through the different
synthetic route. Compound 3 displays a novel 1D decorated
ladder-like chain with the dcd and acetate ligands. Magnetic investigations
indicate that the antiferromagntic interactions exist in compound 3, which may be due to the short Gd···Gd separation
between adjacent Gd3+ cations within the ladder-like chain
[Gd4(OH)4]n. Remarkably,
magnetic investigation for compound 2 indicates a unique
metamagnetic transformation. Furthermore, 2 also presents
a significant MCE with a large magnetic entropy change (−ΔSm = 36.1 J kg–1 K–1 with T = 2.0 K and ΔH =
7.0 T). The study presented here demonstrates that the diverse synthesized
Ln-CPs from the ligand 3,3-dimethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid
are variable depending on the different controlled synthetic conditions,
affording us new opportunities for studying various Ln-CPs with interesting
structures and properties in future. At the same time, the related
study should be of interest in the design of new Ln-CPs based on other
alicyclic dicarboxylic acids, as well as in correlation studies including
geometric structures, gas adsorption properties, and magnetic interaction
mechanisms.

Experimental Section
General Remarks
The compounds were
synthesized in poly(tetrafluoroethylene)-lined stainless steel autoclaves.
All available reagents were of commercial origin with high-purity
grade, and ultrapure water was used in all experiments.

Physical Techniques
The elemental carbon
and hydrogen analysis was carried out on a PerkinElmer 2400 series.
IR spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectrometer. The PerkinElmer Diamond TG/differential thermal
analysis instrument was used for the thermogravimetric thermal analysis.
A Bruker D8 Focus Bragg–Brentano X-ray powder diffractometer
(Cu Kα, λ = 1.54184 Å) was used to measure the PXRD
patterns. A fully automated gas sorption analyzer Autosorb-iQ2-MP
(Quantachrome Instruments) was used to perform the gas sorption measurements.
A Quantum Design MPMS3 instrument was used to determine the magnetic
susceptibility.

Synthesis of Compounds
[La9(μ4-dcd)12(μ3-O)2(H)]n (1)
A mixture of 2.5 mmol La2O3, 5.0 mmol 6,6-dimethyl-3-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,4-dione,
and 20.0 mL H2O was first stirred in a beaker for 30 min.
Then, the obtained aqueous suspension was transferred into a 40 mL
Teflon-lined stainless-steel vessel and heated at 180 °C for
5 days. After the reactant mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature,
the colorless cube-like single crystals of 1 can be found
in the bottom of the vessel. Through filtering and washing with ultrapure
water, the crystals were finally dried in air (yields: ∼85%).

for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Crystal data were gathered
at 296 K with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.071073 nm) using
an Xcalibur Eos Gemini diffractometer. Decreasing data were completed
by the CrysAlisPro program. The direct method was used to handle the
construction by the SHELXL 97 program. The crystal structures were
refined with the full matrix least-squares method based on F2.45 By using the
software Diamond,46 the structural images
for all compounds were obtained. Furthermore, crystallographic data
for crystals 1, 2, and 3 were
stored in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. CCDC 1857980
(1), 1484198 (2), and 1857981 (3) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.
