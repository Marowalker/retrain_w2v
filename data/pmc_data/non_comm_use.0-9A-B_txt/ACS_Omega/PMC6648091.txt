The
reaction of the title lactams with triethyl phosphite prompted
by phosphoryl chloride provided six-membered ring heterocyclic phosphonates
or bisphosphonates. These novel scaffolds might be of interest as
building blocks in medicinal chemistry. The course of the reaction
was dependent on the structure of the used substrate. Thus, morpholin-3-one
and thiomorpholin-3-one readily provided the corresponding 1,1-bisphosphonates
(compounds 1, 2, 7, 14 and 16), whereas the protection of their nitrogen atom
resulted in the formation of dehydrophosphonates (compounds 5, 6, and 8). Piperazin-2-one reacted
differently yielding mixture of cis- and trans- piperazine-2,3-diyl-bisphosphonates (compounds 10 and 11). Since cytosine could be considered
as an analogue of piperin-2-one, its ditosyl derivative 18 was used as a substrate affording compound 19 being
a product of phosphite addition to double bond. In dependence of their
structures, hydrolysis of the obtained diethyl phosphonates resulted
either in corresponding cyclic phosphonic acids or in the degradation
of carbon-to-phosphorus bond.

Introduction
Heterocyclic
rings are key scaffold components in medicinal chemistry
and are the fundamental building blocks of many drugs. However, the
design and preparation of new heterocyclic building blocks is still
a challenging area in the early drug discovery phase.1 The extensive literature focused on the synthesis and functionalization
of azaheterocyclic phosphonates is mostly concentrated on aromatic
compounds,2 with heteroalicyclic ones being
less intensively studied.3a Anyway, numerous
synthetic procedures were elaborated for the syntheses of aziridin-,
azetidin-, pyrrolidin-, and piperidin-ylphosphonic acids and their
derivatives.3 Syntheses of heteroalicyclic
phosphonates bearing a second heteroatom in the ring have been scarcely
described so far,4 and there remains a
great need for further advance in this area.

Since simple lactams
upon reaction with triethyl phosphite prompted
by phosphoryl chloride, a version of Vilsmeier–Haack reaction,3h,5 readily provided cyclic aminobisphosphonates (Scheme 1), the enlargement of the scope of this reaction
is a logic alternative.

Scheme 1 Reaction of Lactams by Vilsmeier–Haack-Like
Reaction
Therefore, we studied
the course of this reaction using morpholin-3-one,
thiomorpholin-3-one, and piperazin-2-one as substrates.

Results and Discussion
Morpholin-3-one
and Thiomorpholin-3-one as Substrates
As expected, the reaction
of morpholin-3-one and thiomorpholin-3-one
with triethyl phosphite and phosphoryl chloride afforded the corresponding
bisphosphonates 1 and 2 in satisfactory
yields (Scheme 2).
These compounds decompose upon hydrolysis by concentrated hydrochloric
acid; therefore, the corresponding phosphonic acids 3 and 4 were obtained by classic dealkylation with trimethylbromosilane
followed by methanolysis of trimethylsilyl esters (Scheme 2). When the amide nitrogen
atom in both substrates was blocked with benzyl moiety, the reaction
afforded corresponding diethyl N-benzyl-2,3-dehydromorpholyl-3-phosphonate
(compound 5) and N-benzyl-2,3-dehydrothiomorpholyl-3-phosphonate
(compound 6) (Scheme 2) as major products.

Scheme 2 Reactions of Morpholin-3-one
and Thiomorpholin-3-one and Their Derivatives
These findings support the assumption that the mechanism
of this
reaction is similar to the one proposed earlier3h and is presented in Scheme 3 for morpholin-3-one.

Scheme 3 Mechanism of Reaction
of Mopholin-3-one and N-benzylmopholin-3-one
It is worth to mention that
we were able to isolate only bisphosphonate 7 as a product
of the analogous reaction of N-benzylvalerolactam.
This product was, however, obtained in low (20%)
yield accompanied by many side-products (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Reaction of N-benzylvalerolactam
Quite unexpectedly, the use of N-phenyl-morpholine-3-one
as a substrate provided monoethyl N-benzyl-2,3-dehydromorpholyl-3-phosphonate
(compound 8) (Scheme 3). Tetraethyl N-benzyl-2,3-morpholyl-3,3-bisphosphonate
(compound 9) was obtained with a good yield in a separate
reaction according to the procedure proposed recently by Wang (Scheme 5).6 Unfortunately, attempts to use this procedure for other
substrates gave unsatisfactory results yielding mixtures of the inseparable
products.

Scheme 5 Synthesis of tetraethyl N-benzyl-2,3-morpholyl-3,3-bisphosphonate
(9) by procedure of Wang et al.6
Piperazin-2-one and Its
analogues as Substrates
The
reaction of piperazin-2-one gave the mixture of products: tetraethyl cis-piperazine-2,3-diyl-bisphosphonate 10,
which is a meso compound and trans-piperazine-2,3-diyl-bisphosphonate 11, which is a racemic mixture of RR and SS stereoisomers
(Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Products
of the Reaction of Piperazin-2-one as a Substrate
The isomers were separated by means of column
chromatography. It
is worth mentioning that the 1H and 13C spectra
of both (cis and trans) isomers are significantly different (Figures S1.10 and S1.17 in the Supporting Information),
which enabled their easy differentiation upon separation.

We
speculate that the mechanism of the formation of a mixture of
compounds 10 and 11 conforms to the general
mechanism of the formation of bisphosphonates with the difference
being in a shift of keto-enol equilibrium toward enamine rather than
to imine upon the action of phosphoryl chloride. The addition of phosphite
to enamine favors the production of gen-bisphosphonates (Scheme 7).

Scheme 7 Presumable Mechanism
of the Formation of gem-bisphosphonates 10 and 11
The hydrolysis of compounds 10 and 11 with concentrated hydrochloric acid provided the corresponding
acids 12 and 13 in good yields (Scheme 6). Their structures
were unequivocally supported
by crystallographic studies (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Crystal structures for compounds 12 (left
panel) and 13 (right panel).

The use of 4-ethyl-piperazin-2,3-dione as a substrate quite
readily
provided corresponding tetraethyl 4-ethyl-3-oxopiperazine-2,2-diyl-bisphosphonate 14 (Scheme 7). The hydrolysis of this compound resulted in the degradation of
carbon-to-phosphorus bond and the product of this degradation, (N′-ethyl-2-aminoethyl)glycine 15, was
isolated and characterized by X-ray studies (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Crystal structure of the product of the degradation
of C–P
bonds upon hydrolysis of compound 14.

Similarly, the 3,4-dihydroqinoxline-2-one provided
low yield of
the corresponding bisphosphonate 16, which appeared to
be also unstable under hydrolytic conditions yielding products of
the breakage of the C–P bonds (Scheme 8). Such instability of benzoannulated bisphosphonates
has been observed earlier.3h

Scheme 8 Reactions
of Derivatives of Piperazin-2,3-dione
Finally, when using 3-methyl-piperazin-3-one as the substrate,
only the product of monophosphonylation 17 was isolated,
albeit in a very small yield (Scheme 9). The formation of this unexpected product suggests
that the reaction has, at least in part, radical mechanism.

Scheme 9 Reaction
of 3-methyl-piperazin-3-one
Cytosine as a Substrate
Cytosine could be also considered
as an analogue of piperin-2-one. Unprotected cytosine did not react,
but blocking of its amino groups by toluenesulfonyl chloride leads
to its ditosyl derivative 18, which reacted quite smoothly
yielding the product 19 of the addition of phosphite
to double bond (Scheme 10). Its structure, as determined by crystallography, is shown
in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Crystal structure
of compound 19.

Scheme 10 Addition of Phosphite to Double Bond of Ditosyl–Cytosine
This compound upon hydrolysis
with concentrated hydrochloric acid
yielded a mixture of unseparable products with 1-tosyl-2,4-dioxo-pirymidyn-6-ylphosphonic
acid 20 being one of the major components.

Conclusions
These, as well as previous studies, indicate that a version of
the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction of lactams with triethyl phosphite
prompted by phosphoryl chloride is a promising mean to synthesize
azaheterocyclic phosphonates. The course of this reaction is strongly
dependent on the structure of the starting lactam, and in some cases,
unexpected products are also formed. Thus, in the case of lactams
possessing unsubstituted nitrogen, the formation of amino-gem-bisphosphonates (compounds 1, 2, 7, 14, and 16) was observed
as the major products, whereas the use of N-substituted
lactams unusually resulted in dehydrophosphonates (compounds 5, 6, and 8). Piperazin-2-one and
2-methyl-piperazin-3-one and cytosine reacted differently yielding
unexpected products. All of the obtained compounds might be considered
as novel building blocks for medicinal chemistry.

Crystallography
Relevant crystallographic data for
the molecules and the full geometrical information are summarized
in Tables S2.1–S2.3 of the Supporting
Information

The single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments
were performed at 100.0(1) K (12, 13, and 19) and at 293(2) K (14) on an Xcalibur diffractometer
(Rigaku Oxford Diffraction, Sevenoaks, Kent, U.K.), equipped with
a CCD detector and a graphite monochromator (Rigaku Oxford Diffraction)
with Mo Kα radiation and furnished with an Oxford Cryosystem
N2 gas stream device. The reciprocal space was explored
by ω scans. The reflections were measured with a radiation exposure
time from 4 to 25 s, according to diffraction intensities. The detector
was positioned at a 60-mm distance from the crystal. Procession of
the diffraction data was performed using the CrysAlis CCD.7 Structures for compounds 12, 13, and 19 were solved in the triclinic crystal
system, P̅1 space group. Compound 14 solved in the monoclinic crystal system, P21/c space group (Table S2.1), by direct methods and refined by a full-matrix least-squares
method using the SHELXL14 program.8 Lorentz
and polarization corrections were applied. Nonhydrogen atoms were
refined anisotropically. In structures, H atoms were refined using
a riding model. The structure drawings were prepared using the OLEX2
program.9 The crystallographic data for
all compounds have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Centre as supplementary publication no. CCDC 1888865 (12), CCDC 1888866 (13), CCDC 1888867 (14),
