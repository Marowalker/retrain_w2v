Anethol
trithione (ATT) has a wide range of physiological activities,
but its use is limited due to its poor water solubility. To improve
the solubility of ATT, we synthesized and characterized a novel phosphate
prodrug (ATXP) relying on the availability of the hydroxy group in
5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiole3-thione (ATX),
which was transformed from ATT rapidly and extensively in vivo. Our
results showed that ATXP significantly improved drug solubility. ATXP
was rapidly converted to ATX and reached a maximum plasma concentration
with a Tmax of approximately 5 min after
intravenous (iv) administration. Furthermore, after the oral administration
of ATXP, the Cmax was 3326.30 ± 566.50
ng/mL, which was approximately 5-fold greater than that of the parent
drug form, indicating that ATXP has greater absorption than that of
ATT. Additionally, the oral phosphate prodrug ATXP increased the ATX
in the area under the plasma concentration vs time curves (AUC0–t = 3927.40 ± 321.50 and AUC0–∞ = 4579.0 ± 756.30), making its use in
practical applications more meaningful. Finally, compared to the vehicle,
ATXP was confirmed to maintain the bioactivity of the parent drug
for a significant reduction in infarct volume 24 h after reperfusion.
Based on these findings, the phosphate prodrug ATXP is a potentially
useful water-soluble prodrug with improved pharmacokinetic properties.

1 Introduction
Anethol
trithione (ATT) (Figure 1) is a sulfur heterocyclic compound that has attracted
attention due to its function as a slow-releasing H2S donor.1 Additionally, ATT possesses various pharmacological
properties. It has been used for decades for treating xerostomia by
enhancing salivary secretion and increasing muscarinic acetylcholine
receptors.2 It is a bile secretion-stimulating
drug or cholagogue that protects the liver via an increase in glutathione
levels and phase II detoxifying enzymes.3 ATT is a potentially efficacious chemoprevention agent for lung
cancer and exerts chemopreventive effects in several target organs,
such as the liver and colon, by increasing the detoxification rate
of carcinogens in these target organs.4−6 In addition, ATT protects
blood–brain barrier integrity following cerebral ischemia,
an effect largely mediated by significantly elevated serum H2S released by ATT.7 However, the use of
ATT is greatly restricted by its poor water solubility (0.38 μg/mL)
and limited oral bioavailability in vivo because of its extreme lipophilicity.8,9

Figure 1 Synthetic
protocol of ATXP phosphate prodrugs.

Some pharmaceutical methods have been used to improve the hydrophilicity
and oral bioavailability of ATT. Lipid-based formulations have been
explored to enhance the oral bioavailability of the poorly water-soluble
drug ATT, and the AUC0–8h and Cmax from the lipid formulations are 1.4- to 3.0-fold and
2.0- to 4.8-fold higher than those from suspensions, respectively.9 However, lipidic vehicles might influence CYP-mediated
metabolism in the liver; hence, the proportion of ATT metabolized
to 4-hydroxy-anethole trithione (ATX) was significantly reduced.10 Furthermore, water-soluble analogs of ATT were
synthesized by substituting the methyl group of ATT with the simple
hydrophilic alkylamino group, and the amine salt prodrugs have a solubility
of up to 20 mg/mL.11 The conversion of
this amine salt prodrug to ATX via O-demethylation
by O-demethylase was consistent with ATT metabolism.11,12 However, the activity of O-demethylase varies between
different populations, and reduced activity has been found in patients
with impaired liver function, which probably causes differences in
the conversion of the above prodrugs in different populations.13,14 This finding encouraged us to apply prodrug design methods based
on ATT’s active metabolite (ATX). However, ATX also has poor
solubility. To improve the solubility of ATX, the methyl group was
substituted with various lipid groups via ester linkage with the hydroxyl
group of ATX, but the solubility remained limited, only 660.6 ng/mL,
which was approximately 14 times that of ATT.15 Therefore, it is necessary to find a new method to greatly improve
the solubility of ATT while simultaneously avoiding any adverse side
effects on the human body.

Phosphate ester prodrug strategies
are widely used for improving
aqueous solubility for oral administration, especially for drugs intended
for parenteral administration.16 The active
parent drug molecule is rapidly released from phosphate prodrugs by
endogenous phosphatases, such as alkaline phosphatase, which is expressed
in many tissues throughout the body.17 The
solubility of the phosphate sodium salt of the acacetin prodrug was
more than 1.9 million timeshigher than that of the parent drug acacetin,
which would be suitable for developing an intravenous (iv) preparation.18 UNIL088 is a water-soluble prodrug of cyclosporine
A (CsA) developed for topical eye delivery.19 These phosphate prodrugs have significantly greater water solubility
than their parent drugs, thereby enhancing absorption, bioavailability,
and patient acceptance.

Based on previous studies, it is desirable
to improve the solubility
of ATT by using an ATX phosphate precursor. ATX has a hydroxyl group
that provides a place for intervention by phosphate precursors, thereby
controlling the properties of ATX. Notably, ATT has important physiological
activities, such as protecting the rat brain from focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
(IR) injury.7 Therefore, whether ATX prodrugs
retain these activities is worthy of attention and research.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Solubility
ATT
has extremely low
water solubility (0.38 μg/mL).9,10 After an oral
therapeutic dose, the plasma concentration of ATT becomes very low.
This low plasma concentration is observed because ATT is metabolized
rapidly in vivo into ATX via O-demethylation.10,12 Although the solubility of ATX was better than that of ATT, its
solubility remained very low (Table 1) and did not meet the requirements of iv administration.
In the present study, ATT was not directly used as a parent drug for
prodrug design; rather, its active metabolite ATX was used for prodrug
synthesis. As mentioned in the literature review, ATT is quickly metabolized
into ATX via O-demethylation by O-demethylase, which has a similar pharmacological activity to ATT.11,12 Therefore, it can be assumed that ATX is the active form of ATT.
Prodrug design strategies are based on the active metabolites, which
can reduce the difference in drug metabolism due to differences in
the expression and activity of individual O-demethylase
enzymes.13,14,20 Furthermore,
the presence of the hydroxyl group of ATX provides a handle for phosphate
prodrug intervention, whereby solubility can be improved. Thus, this
study aimed to assess the importance of the phosphate prodrug ATXP
in improving water solubility and retaining ATT activity. As expected,
the aqueous solubility of ATT was greatly enhanced by the prodrug
ATXP because this compound has a solubility of approximately 2.1 mg/mL
in ultrapure water, 1.5 mg/mL in NaCl solution (pH = 7.4), and 1.7
mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH = 7.4) (Table 1). Thus, the prodrug ATXP increases
ATX and ATT solubility by over 1800-fold, which could allow drug dissolution
in saline solution at concentrations useful for therapeutic applications.

2.2 Stability in Saline Solution
The
stability of the prodrug was assessed in saline solution at 37 °C.
Experiments showed that ATXP was highly stable, and the parent drug
ATX was not detected after incubation for 12 h in saline solution,
indicating that ATXP did not undergo spontaneous hydrolysis. ATXP
remained stable even after 30 days of continuous incubation in saline
solution (Figure 2A).
The stability of ATXP was an important foundation for the development
of a drug used for iv application. The above results also suggest
that ATX released from ATXP in plasma in the next experiment in the
present study was not due to poor stability but to hydrolysis of ATXP
by phosphatase.

Figure 2 ATXP can be hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase in vitro.
The concentration
of HP was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
(A) Stability of the prodrug was examined in saline solution at 37
°C and sampled at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 3 days, and 30 days. Then,
HPLC was applied to determine the amount of ATX released in the ATXP
saline solution. (B) ATX can be released rapidly from ATXP by alkaline
phosphatase and detected by HPLC. (C) ATXP (300 μM) was hydrolyzed
by alkaline phosphatase at pH 7.4, 37 °C with a half-life of
less than 5 s. (D) ATXP (80 μM) was hydrolyzed in human plasma
at 37 °C, and samples were determined at different time points.

2.3 Hydrolysis of ATXP in Alkaline
Phosphatase
Solution and Plasma
Evaluation of the alkaline phosphatase
hydrolysis of ATXP was carried out in a boric acid buffer solution
at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. ATXP was completely hydrolyzed into ATX
in less than 5 s (Figure 2B,C). The hydrolysis study revealed that ATX can be effectively
hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase, which is promising for further
drug development. In our previous study, the half-life (t1/2) value of the phosphate prodrug of honokiol was 8.9
s, and it was completely released by hydrolysis at approximately 20
s.21 This faster process may be the result
of fewer phosphate ester groups in ATXP. ATX has only one hydroxyl
group to form an ester with a phosphate group, whereas honokiol has
two groups that can undergo this reaction. This result also suggests
the possibility for prolonged hydrolysis time via increasing the number
of phosphate esters and for pharmacokinetic regulation.

However,
the alkaline phosphatase used in this experiment was derived from
the bovine intestinal mucosa. Due to the differences in species, we
used plasma to determine whether ATXP can be hydrolyzed to ATX by
phosphatase in plasma. As expected, the prodrug ATXP released ATX
in human plasma, but this hydrolysis process was milder than the above
enzyme buffer system and took nearly 24 h, with 25 μM ATX released
from ATXP (Figure 2D). The activity of alkaline phosphatase in plasma for these substrates
is obviously lower than that in many tissues; alkaline phosphatase
activity is especially abundant in hepatic, skeletal, and renal tissues.17,22 Thus, unsurprisingly, the hydrolysis rate of ATXP was relatively
moderate in plasma. Moreover, the complex components in plasma, such
as plasma proteins, affect the hydrolysis of prodrugs. For example,
the extremely slow hydrolysis rate of a prodrug can be induced by
the high plasma protein binding of the prodrug.23 In contrast, prodrugs showing low protein binding have
increased the availability of prodrugs for hydrolysis in plasma.24 Taken together, these findings strongly suggest
that the in vivo administration of the prodrug ATXP could rapidly
release the parent drug. Therefore, it was necessary to conduct pharmacokinetic
experiments with the prodrug ATXP.

2.4 Pharmacokinetics
of ATXP and ATT in Rats
The fast-enzymatic hydrolysis of
ATXP suggested that the prodrug
could be transformed into the active compound ATX promptly to exert
its biological activity in vivo. This quick hydrolysis was also reflected
in the pharmacokinetic parameters, such as Tmax. Our pharmacokinetics study demonstrated that after iv
administration, ATXP was rapidly converted to ATX with a Tmax of approximately 5 min (Table 2). Although there was a slow transformation
of the prodrug ATXP in the plasma incubation experiment in vitro (Figure 2C), once the drug
was administered in vivo, the hydrolysis process for the prodrug ATPX
was greatly accelerated due to the abundance of alkaline phosphatase
in tissues.

The effect of solubility
optimization is one of the key elements
of pharmacokinetic enhancement.25 The prodrug
approach is a promising molecular modification by which drug developers
and designers can modulate drug pharmacokinetics.26 This idea encouraged us to determine whether the pharmacokinetics
were improved after the oral administration of ATXP. As expected,
our pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that after the oral administration
of 25 mg/kg ATXP (equimolar with 17.1 mg/kg ATT), the Cmax of the ATXP-PO group was 3326.30 ± 566.50 ng/mL,
which was approximately 5-fold higher than that of the ATT-PO group
(709.77 ± 222.93 ng/mL, Table 2). Compared to the parent drug form, the oral phosphate
prodrug AXTP indeed resulted in improved absorption. This finding
also agrees with our earlier observations, which showed that the Cmax of the oral phosphate prodrug group was
10 times that of the parent drug PO group.21

Additionally, the ATXP-PO group (Figure 3B) showed a greater increase in ATX in the
area under the plasma concentration vs time curves (AUC(0–t) = 3927.40 ± 321.50 h·ng/mL) than did
the ATT-PO group (AUC(0–t) = 2364.49
± 216.11 h·ng/mL). Furthermore, the Tmax (0.30 h) of the ATXP-PO group was markedly shorter than
that of the ATT-PO group (0.52 h). In contrast, the t1/2 of ATX in the ATT-PO group (6.60 ± 1.92 h) was
longer than that in the ATXP-PO group (3.44 ± 1.63 h), reflecting
the slow absorption of ATT after PO dosing in the digestive tract.
Moreover, we concluded that the prolonged mean residence time (MRT)
of the ATT-PO group [MRT(0–∞) = 11.60 ±
2.95] was greater than that of the phosphate prodrug ATXP group [MRT(0–∞) = 3.09 ± 0.04].

Figure 3 Concentration of ATX
was determined by liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) after intravenous and oral administration
with equimolar amounts of ATXP and ATT in the plasma of rats in vivo
at several points. (A) Mean plasma concentration–time curves
of ATX after intravenous administration (ATXP-15 mg/kg); (B) mean
plasma concentration–time curves of ATX after oral administration
(ATXP-25 mg/kg, ATT-17.1 mg/kg). Each point represents the mean ±
SD (n = 3).

Our findings were inconsistent with those of previous studies,
which suggested that compared to the parent drugs, oral phosphate
prodrugs could hardly improve the absorption because the rapid parent
drug generation via intestinal alkaline phosphatase led to parent
drug precipitation.27 A possible explanation
from a previous study for this issue involves an increased absorptive
flux across the intestinal mucosa due to intraluminal supersaturation
of the parent drug released from intestinal dephosphorylation of the
prodrug.28 This inconsistency may also
be because ATX is directly released from the prodrug in the intestine,
while ATX in the plasma of the oral ATT administration group was converted
from O-demethylation by O-demethylase
in the liver after ATT absorption in the intestine. Based on these
findings, the phosphate prodrug design method for ATT was successfully
verified and ATXP was readily converted to ATX in vivo in rats for
iv or per os (po) administration with improved pharmacokinetic properties.
Hence, whether the prodrugs retained these pharmacological activities
deserves further research.

2.5 ATXP Ameliorated IR Injury
in Middle Cerebral
Artery Occlusion (MCAO) Rats
According to previous studies,
ATT plays protective roles during brain IR injury in rats by protecting
against damage to the blood–brain barrier through H2S released from inorganic ATT.7 Due to
the insolubility of ATT, it has been administered in a vehicle composed
of 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in corn oil.7 However, this vehicle cannot be used in actual clinical practice.
In the present study, the phosphate prodrug of ATX exhibits great
optimization of the solubility parameters and effective release of
ATX. Therefore, it was necessary to confirm whether ATX could maintain
its bioactivity to ameliorate IR injury after structural transformation.

In the present study, edaravone, a low-molecular-weight antioxidant
drug targeting peroxyl radicals among many types of reactive oxygen
species, was chosen as a positive drug control.29 Because of its capacity to scavenge free radicals, edaravone
iv infusion has been approved in Japan and China as a drug to treat
acute ischemic stroke.29,30 In addition, ATXP and edaravone
are freely soluble in saline (0.9%), while ATT has limited use due
to its poor water solubility. Therefore, we did not establish an ATT
experimental group. After 2 h of blood flow interruption and 15 min
of reperfusion, certain degrees of edema and damage occurred in the
brain tissue of rats. Compared to rats that received a vehicle, rats
that received ATXP (5 mg/kg) or edaravone (6 mg/kg) showed significant
reductions in infarct volume at 24 h after reperfusion (P = 0.0020 and 0.0489, respectively), as shown in Figure 4A,B. There was no significant
difference between the ATXP group and the edaravone group (P > 0.05). In addition, the neurological deficits were
determined
in all rats in the present study. Our results showed varying degrees
of deficit, with damaged sensorimotor ability in the vehicle group
and the protective role of ATXP and edaravone in reducing the neurological
deficit score (Figure 4C). In detail, all groups immediately exhibited an obvious neurological
damage phenotype after reperfusion (0 h), but only the neurological
deficit score of the vehicle group increased after 24 h of reperfusion
(P = 0.0379), reflecting that the neurological deficits
were further aggravated without the drug intervention. In contrast,
the ATXP- and edaravone-treated groups did not exhibit increased neurological
scores after 24 h of reperfusion (P = 0.671 and 0.4298,
respectively), indicating the inhibition of neurological damage by
the treatment strategy. Our results suggested that ATXP could indeed
protect against IR-induced brain damage and inhibit the further aggravation
of neurological impairment, consistent with the results of a previous
study on ATT.7

Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality,
and timely
treatment and intervention can minimize long-term disability by salvaging
the at-risk penumbra and consequently reducing the associated morbidity
and mortality, which requires the rapid onset of drugs.31 Hence, ATXP could be used to treat stroke via
iv injection owing to its great water solubility to achieve a rapid
onset. These results indicated that ATXP might be a potent neuroprotective
agent against focal cerebral IR injury.

3 Conclusions
Our phosphate prodrug design focused on using ATT active metabolites
(ATX) as the parent drug and masking the hydroxy group of ATX. As
the phosphate prodrug, ATXP greatly enhanced the aqueous solubility
of ATX or ATT. ATXP can readily release ATX in rats after both iv
and po administration. ATXP retained its desired biological activity
of ameliorating IR injury after structural transformation. In conclusion,
the phosphate prodrug ATXP is a potentially useful water-soluble prodrug
with improved pharmacokinetic properties that could merit further
development as a drug candidate.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
ATT was purchased from
J&K Scientific Ltd. (Beijing, China). Alkaline phosphatase was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Phosphorus oxychloride
and other reagents were obtained from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Company
(Chengdu, China).

4.2 ATX
ATX was synthesized
according
to a modified version of a previously described procedure.11 As shown in Figure 1, ATT (20.00 g, 83.20 mmol) and anhydrous
pyridine hydrochloride (57.80 g, 0.50 mol) were added to a round-bottomed
flask. The mixture was heated to 220 °C for 30 min under a nitrogen
atmosphere. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and
200 mL ethyl acetate and 200 mL water were added and stirred for 30
min at 50 °C. The suspension was filtered; next, the organic
layer was separated, washed three times with water, dried with Na2SO4, and then decolorized with activated carbon
overnight. The mixture was filtrated, the filtrate was concentrated
until solid precipitation occurred, and 50 mL petroleum ether was
added to the residue and then crystallized to provide ATX as an orange
solid (12.00 g, 64%; Figures S1–S3 Supporting Information). The purity (>95%) was determined by
HPLC
(Table S4 and Figure S8, Supporting Information).

4.3 ATX Sodium Phosphate (ATXP)
As shown
in Figure 1, ATX (10
g) was dissolved in 200 mL dichloromethane, and pyridine (21 g) was
added into the ATX dichloromethane solution. This mixture was lowered
to a temperature below −10 °C. Then, phosphorus oxychloride
(27 g) was added dropwise to the solution. The reaction mixture was
stirred for approximately 5 h at −5 to 0 °C until ATX
completely disappeared. After the reaction was completed, ice water
(200 mL) was added, and the mixture was stirred for another 30 min.
The compound (ATX phosphate) was deposited at the bottom of the bottle
as an oil. The supernatant fraction was dumped, and the residue was
washed twice with 1 N HCl (40 mL). The crude product was dissolved
in 100 mL tetrahydrofuran and dried with Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to provide the compound (ATX phosphate)
(12.00 g, 88.6%). For the ATX phosphate (10 g) solution in ethanol
(30 mL), the saturated sodium methoxide solution in methanol was added
dropwise at room temperature until neutral pH conditions were achieved.
The mixture was stirred for 30 min at 25 °C, filtered, and dried
to obtain the crude (ATXP) brown solid (9.17 g, 80.0%). Crude ATXP
(9.17 g) was dissolved in H2O (44 mL) at 70 °C and
then cooled to room temperature slowly. Anhydrous ethanol (88 g, 111
mL) was added to the above solution (in this process, an amount of
product precipitated). The suspension was stirred for 1 h, filtered,
and dried to provide the ATXP light red solid (disodium salt of ATX
phosphate, 5.83 g, 64%; Figures S4–S6, Supporting Information). The purity (>95%) was determined by
HPLC
(Table S3 and Figure S7, Supporting Information).

4.4 High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
HPLC analysis was performed on Waters 2695 apparatus coupled to
Waters 2996 on a photodiode array detector and analyzed by Waters
Empower 2 software (Waters, Milford, MA). HPLC was performed using
a Kro-masil 100-5 C18 column (5 μm, 250 mm × 4.6 mm), a
mobile phase of 75% methanol, and ultrapure water containing 1% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and a detection wavelength set
at 350 nm.

4.5 Detection of ATXP and ATX
Solubility
The aqueous solubilities of ATXP and ATX were
determined at 25 °C
in ultrapure water, 0.9% NaCl solution (pH = 7.4), and PBS (pH = 7.4),
respectively. Excess amounts of ATXP and ATX were added to 1.5 mL
polypropylene centrifuge microtubes containing 1 mL of the above solution.
The mixtures were incubated for 1, 24, and 48 h, sampled, filtered
(0.22 μm, Millipore, Billerca, MA), and analyzed by HPLC. The
experiments were repeated three times.

4.6 Stability
of ATXP in Saline
ATXP
was dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride solution (0.9% NaCl solution,
pH = 7.4) at 65 μg/mL and aliquoted after sterilization via
filtration. The prepared ATXP solution was incubated at 37 °C
and sampled at 0, 12, 24 h, 3, and 30 days. Then, HPLC was applied
to determine the amount of ATX released in the ATXP saline solution,
which reflects the stability of ATXP in saline. The experiments were
performed in triplicate.

4.7 Hydrolysis of ATXP by Alkaline
Phosphatase
To determine whether ATXP can be hydrolyzed in
alkaline phosphatase,
ATXP was dissolved in a boric acid buffer solution at pH 7.4 (final
concentration, 300 μM, in triplicate). After sterilization by
filtration, the vehicle control group and experimental group were
simultaneously preheated at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, excess alkaline
phosphatase was added to the above groups (5000 DEA units/L) and sampled
at 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 600 s, and 30 min. Finally, HPLC was used
to detect the amount of ATX released from ATXP by alkaline phosphatase.

4.8 Hydrolysis of ATXP in Human Plasma
The
blood donors were healthy individuals who provided informed consent.
Lithium heparin blood samples were centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min to remove cells and platelets, and the plasma was collected.
Subsequently, ATXP was added to the plasma (final concentration, 80
μM) and incubated at 37 °C for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12,
and 24 h. The plasma sample (200 μL) was mixed with precooled
ethyl acetate for 5 min in 1.5 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes,
and then the mixture was centrifuged at 6000g for
10 min. The clear supernatant was analyzed using HPLC by measuring
the concentration of ATX, which was released from ATXP. Data are from
representative experiments in triplicate.

4.9 Pharmacokinetics
Study
Male Sprague-Dawley
rats (7 weeks old, each weighing 220–250 g) were purchased
from Beijing WeiTong Lihua Experimental Animal Technology company
(Beijing, China). Rats were divided into three groups (n = 3 animals per group): ATXP intravenous treatment group (ATXP-IV
group, 12.5 mg/kg), ATXP oral treatment group (ATXP-PO group, 25 mg/kg),
and ATT oral treatment group (ATT-PO group, 17.1 mg/kg). Rats in the
ATXP-PO group and ATT-PO group were orally administered an equimolar
mass of ATX. For intravenous injection, the ATXP was dissolved in
saline (0.1% w/w polysorbate 80, pH = 7.0–7.4) at a concentration
of 2.5 mg/mL, and the injection amount was 5 mL/kg. For oral administration,
ATT was dissolved in 10% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD)
to obtain a concentration of 1.71 mg/mL, and the gavage volume was
10 mL/kg. ATXP was dissolved in saline water to obtain a solution
with a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL (0.1% w/w polysorbate 80), and the
gavage volume was 10 mL/kg. Blood samples were collected through a
cannulated tube at designated times of 0, 5, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 4,
6, 8, and 24 h into tubes containing heparin sodium. Plasma was separated
from the samples by centrifugation (2000g, 6 min,
2–8 °C; plasma samples were stored at −80 °C
before analysis). Finally, an aliquot of 200 μL of the supernatant
was analyzed by LC–MS/MS (Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information).

4.10 Establishment
of the Middle Cerebral Artery
Occlusion (MCAO) Model
The ethics committee of Chengdu Medical
College approved the experimental program, and all animal experiments
were conducted in accordance with the Chinese Animal Welfare Law.
Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing approximately 280
g (obtained from Beijing Weitong Lihua Experimental Animal Technology
company, Beijing, China) were anesthetized with halothane (3%) and
subjected to MCAO as previously described, with minor modifications
of the method established by EZ Longa.32 In brief, a 2 cm incision was made along the ventral midline, and
the shallow fascial muscle tissue of the right neck was carefully
dissected. The external, internal, and common carotid arteries (external
carotid artery (ECA), internal carotid artery (ICA), and common carotid
artery (CCA), respectively) were exposed in turn. Clamping the ICA
and then ligating the ECA makes it easier to mobilize the CCA. The
distal end of the CCA was tied, and a suture was placed around the
CCA at the proximal end to ensure that the blood vessels were not
blocked. Arteriotomy was performed between the two lines on the CCA.
A 4-0 monofilament nylon suture was inserted in the ICA ∼18
mm into the ECA incision site. Insertion of the suture was halted
when slight resistance was encountered. At this point, the suture
blocked the blood flow of the right MCA. Ischemic rats were placed
in an environment at 37 °C for 2 h; then, the sutures were carefully
removed to allow MCA reperfusion.

Rats were randomly divided
into three groups (n = 12 animals per group), and
the following drugs were intravenously administered: the control group
was treated with tail vein injection of 0.9% saline, the positive
control group was treated with a single dose of 6 mg/kg edaravone
immediately after reperfusion by tail vein injection, and the experimental
group was treated with a double dose of 5 mg/kg ATXP. The first dose
of ATXP was administered immediately after reperfusion, and the second
dose was given 5–6 h later. The control group was treated with
physiological saline, which was administered in the same manner as
ATXP.

4.11 Measurement of Infarct Volume
After
the treatment, the rats were euthanized. The skull cavity was carefully
removed to expose the entire brain. The brain was immediately placed
in a freezer at −20 °C until it was completely frozen.
The frozen brain tissue of each rat was cut into 2-mm-thick sections
for a total of six slices. Then, the slices were placed in 5% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and stained at 37 °C
for 15–20 min in the dark. Brain slices were removed for immersion
in a 4% formaldehyde solution protected from light. The noninfarcted
area was red after staining, and the infarcted area was white. Each
slice of the brain was placed on a piece of filter paper and photographed
with a digital camera. The infarct area was measured with ImageJ software
(https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The representative images of TTC staining are shown in Figure 4B.

4.12 Determination of Behavior Score
For all animals, a
researcher blinded to the experimental group performed
a series of behavioral tests before MCAO and after MCAO, and the neurological
scoring system was previously described.33 In brief, 0, no symptoms of neurological damage; 1, unable to extend
the contralateral forelimb fully; 2, inability to walk straight and
circling toward the ipsilateral side; 3, leaning to the affected side;
4, no spontaneous locomotor activity; 5, death. Therefore, higher
scores indicated more severe injuries.

4.13 Statistical
Analyses
Statistical
analysis was performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
Each result is shown as the mean ± SD. The difference between
the means of the control group and treatment group was measured by t-tests, and differences with a probability less than or
equal to 0.05 were considered significant.
