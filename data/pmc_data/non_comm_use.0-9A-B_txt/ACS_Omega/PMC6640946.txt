In Figures
3a and 3b we presented a subset of cryoTEM images acquired
from a 1 wt % aqueous solution of the μ-O(C2F2) terpolymer 10 weeks after preparation. While we have evidence
for micelles in cryoTEM images obtained from that sample, we certainly
cannot rule out the presence of ice in Figure 3, as suggested in a
personal communication with Dr. Marc Stuart at the University of Groningen
after publication of our work. The consistency of the size of putative
ice crystals in these images and the DLS measurements for this sample
in solution could certainly have contributed to a possible misinterpretation
of the cryoTEM images.

If the features in Figure 3 are not micelles
as we report, this
does not impact the main conclusions of the paper since the structures
that ultimately form from this sample at long annealing times are
raspberry micelles as shown in Figure 4, consistent with other miktoarm
star samples we have studied in the past (see for example: Li, Z.;
Hillmyer, M. A.; Lodge, T. P. Langmuir2006, 22, 9409–9417. DOI: 10.1021/la0620051).
Also, the unexpected formation of vesicles by another polymer sample
μ-O(C3F2) is also incontrovertible.

We thank Yaming Jiang and Peter Schmidt for helpful input on cryoTEM
imaging during the preparation of this correction.
