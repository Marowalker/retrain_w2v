Glipizide
(GLZ) is an oral hypoglycemic agent, which is
a weakly aqueous soluble drug. The solubility values of GLZ in various
neat solvents are scarce in the literature. Hence, the solubility
of GLZ in 12 different neat solvents, namely, “water, methanol,
ethanol, isopropanol (IPA), 1-butanol, 2-butanol, ethylene glycol
(EG), propylene glycol (PG), poly(ethylene glycol)-400 (PEG-400),
ethyl acetate (EA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and Transcutol-HP (THP)”,
at “T = 298.2–318.2 K” and “p = 0.1 MPa” was measured. The recorded solubilities
of GLZ were correlated by “van’t Hoff and Apelblat models”
using root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). The overall RMSD was obtained
as 1.21 and 1.40% for “Apelblat and van’t Hoff models”,
respectively. Different solubility parameters of all studied materials
including drug and solvent were calculated to find the best solvent
for GLZ. The solubilities of GLZ (expressed in mole fraction) have
been found highest in DMSO (2.81 × 10–2), followed
by THP, EA, 2-butanol, 1-butanol, IPA, PEG-400, ethanol, PG, methanol,
EG, and water (1.98 × 10–4) at “T = 318.2 K”. All investigated solubility parameters
of GLZ were recorded very close to the DMSO. “Apparent thermodynamic
analysis” showed an “endothermic and entropy-driven
dissolution” of GLZ in the 12 different neat solvents. The
highest molecular interactions were recorded in GLZ–DMSO compared
to other combinations. Overall, DMSO has been considered as the best
solvent for the solubilization of GLZ.

Introduction
Glipizide (GLZ) [chemical
structure: Figure 1; chemical name: N-[2-(4-{[(cyclohexyl
carbamoyl)amino]sulfonyl}phenyl)ethyl]-5-methylpyrazine-2-carboxamide;
molecular formula: C21H27N5O4S; molar mass: 445.53 g mol–1; and CASRN:
29094-61-9] was found as a white solid powder, and it has been reported
as stable at T = 298.2 K.1,2

Figure 1 Molecular
structure of GLZ.

It is a second-generation
sulfonylurea used as an oral hypoglycemic
agent for the treatment of type-II diabetes (non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus).3 It has been reported
as a class II drug, which has a low solubility and high permeability.
Class II drugs have oral bioavailability problems due to poor aqueous
solubility.4 The originator of GLZ is Pfizer.
The melting point of GLZ has been reported as 481.2–482.2 K.
Being a weak acid (pKa = 5.9), GLZ is
practically insoluble in water, sparingly soluble in acetone, and
soluble in dichloromethane.3 The log P value of GLZ was obtained as 1.91 in the n-octanol–water system. The terminal elimination half-life
of GLZ is 2–7 h, and the initial oral dosage of GLZ is 5–20
mg once daily. Compared to tolbutamide, it is 100 times more potent.
It acts to decrease the blood glucose level by motivating the pancreatic
β-cells liberation, which causes an increased insulin secretion.4 GLZ has also been reported as a significant anticancer
agent that acts by suppressing the tumor angiogenesis (obstruct the
formation and development of blood vessels), tumor growth, and metastasis.5 The anticancer efficacy of GLZ is neither because
of its antiproliferative effects nor due to its antidiabetic properties.
Rather, GLZ inhibits the migration and formation of endothelial cells
and tubular structures, respectively. Thus, it “inhibits angiogenesis
by upregulating the expression of natriuretic peptide receptor-A”.5,6 Because of the poor aqueous solubility and minimal dissolution,
the oral bioavailability of GLZ has been reported to be very low after
oral administration. Poor aqueous solubility causes reduced absorption
of the drug. The bioavailability of a BCS class II drug (e.g., GLZ)
depends on its solubility; therefore, in such cases, dissolution is
the rate-limiting step. Being an antidiabetic drug, GLZ should be
absorbed quickly; therefore, increasing the solubility is an essential
criterion for its enhanced bioavailability.

The solubility,
dissolution, and eventually the bioavailability
of GLZ can be improved by different techniques such as development
of liquisolid tablets by using poly(ethylene glycol)-400 (PEG-400)
as a liquid vehicle,4 polymeric microparticles,7,8 polymeric nanoparticles,9 co-solvent
solubilization approach,2 complexation
of GLZ with α and β-cyclodextrins,10−12 solid self-nanoemulsification,3 microemulsion technology,13,14 preparation of osmotically controlled oral drug-delivery system,15 solid dispersion,16−20 nanosuspension,21 microwave-generated
bionanocomposites,22 transdermal drug-delivery
system,23 floating bioadhesive drug-delivery
system,24 and microcrystallization.25 The solubility data of GLZ in various neat solvents
(NS) are scarce in research database. The solubility data of drugs
and pharmaceuticals in various neat solvents had a greater impact
in many industrial processes including “drug discovery process
and formulation development”.26−28 Hence, the solubility
of GLZ in 12 different neat solvents, such as “water, methanol,
ethanol, isopropanol (IPA), 1-butanol, 2-butanol, ethylene glycol
(EG), propylene glycol (PG), PEG-400, ethyl acetate (EA), Transcutol-HP
(THP), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)”, within the temperature
range “T = 298.2–318.2 K” and
pressure “p = 0.1 MPa” was estimated
by applying various experimental and computational approaches. The
investigated temperature range at the interval of 5 K was chosen randomly
based on the melting point of GLZ and boiling temperatures of each
investigated solvent. Therefore, the temperature range, i.e., T = 298.2–318.2 K, was chosen in such a way that
the maximum studied temperature, i.e., “T =
318.2 K”, should not exceed the melting point of GLZ and boiling
temperatures of each investigated solvent. The melting point of GLZ
was obtained as 484.21 K by thermal analysis. The maximum studied
temperature (T = 318.2 K) was much lower than the
melting point of GLZ and boiling temperature of each studied solvent.
Therefore, the studied temperature range was selected in this work.
Different solubility parameters were also determined for the evaluation
of the best solvent for GLZ. “Apparent thermodynamic analysis”
was performed to evaluate the thermodynamic behavior of GLZ. The molecular
interactions between GLZ and 12 different neat solvents were also
investigated. The solubility values, solubility parameters, and thermodynamic
parameters of GLZ recorded in the proposed work could be helpful in
“purification, recrystallization, drug discovery, preformulation
studies, and formulation development” of GLZ.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of GLZ
in Solid States
The characterization of GLZ in the solid
states of pure and equilibrated
GLZ was performed by “differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)”
analysis. The recorded DSC thermogram of GLZ in pure form is summarized
in Figure 2A, which
shows a sharp crystalline peak of GLZ at 484.21 K, suggesting the
fusion temperature (Tfus) of GLZ. The
molar fusion enthalpy (ΔHfus) for
pure GLZ was recorded as 63.33 kJ mol–1. The recorded
DSC thermogram of equilibrated GLZ (which was recovered from EA) is
summarized in Figure 2B, which also presents a sharp crystalline peak of equilibrated GLZ
at 482.24 K, suggesting the Tfus value
of equilibrated GLZ. The ΔHfus value
for equilibrated GLZ was recorded as 66.42 kJ mol–1.

Figure 2 DSC spectra of (A) pure GLZ and (B) equilibrated GLZ (recovered
from EA after slow evaporation).

The DSC thermograms and thermal parameters (Tfus and ΔHfus) of pure and
equilibrated GLZ were not changed significantly (P > 0.05), suggesting that the crystalline form of GLZ was not
changed
into the formation of solvent complexes, solvates, hydrates, polymorphs
etc. after solubility experiments/equilibrium. The Tfus value of GLZ was determined as 484.60 K by Dash et
al.3 Choudhary et al. determined the Tfus value of GLZ as 478.20 K.18 Shende and Fiske found the Tfus value of GLZ as 489.28 K.19 The determined Tfus value of GLZ at 484.21 K in the proposed
study was very close to that reported by Dash et al.3 However, it was little deviated from those reported by
Choudhary et al. and Shende and Fiske.18,19

2.2 Experimental Solubility Data of GLZ
The experimental
solubility (xe) values
of GLZ in 12 different neat solvents at T = 298.2–318.2
K and p = 0.1 MPa are summarized in Table 1. The solubility of GLZ in water
has been reported by many researchers. However, the quantitative solubility
values of GLZ in other studied neat solvents have not been reported.

The solubility of GLZ was determined
as 10.20 μg mL–1 (converted to 4.14 ×
10–7 in mole fraction)
at “T = 298.2 K” by Seedher and Kanojia.2 However, Manjila et al. found the solubility
of GLZ as 51.80 μg mL–1 (converted to 2.09
× 10–6 in mole fraction) at T = 298.2 K.25 On the other hand, the solubility
of GLZ was reported as 33.00 μg mL–1 (converted
to 1.33 × 10–6 in mole fraction), 7.79 μg
mL–1 (converted to 3.15 × 10–7 in mole fraction) and 4.46 μg mL–1 (converted
to 1.80 × 10–7 in mole fraction) at “T = 310.2 K” by Dash et al. (2015), Yang et al. (2009),
and Jadhav and Bharat (2012), respectively.3,20,29 The solubility of GLZ was recorded as 4.85
× 10–7 in mole fraction at T = 298.2 K, which was very close to that reported by Seedher and
Kanojia2 but deviated from that reported
by Manjila et al.25 The solubility of GLZ
at T = 310.2 K was not determined directly in the
proposed study, but it was estimated from the interpolation of graph
constructed between ln xe and 1/T. The solubility of GLZ in mole fraction at T = 310.2 K by interpolation of graph was obtained as 1.24 ×
10–6 in the present study. This value was found
to be close to that reported by Dash et al.3 but deviated from those reported by Yang et al.29 and Jadhav and Bharat.20

Overall, the xe values of GLZ increased
significantly with increase in temperature in all neat solvents evaluated
(P < 0.05). The xe values of GLZ were obtained highest in DMSO (2.81 × 10–2), followed by THP (2.40 × 10–3), EA (1.52 × 10–3), 2-butanol (8.98 ×
10–4), 1-butanol (8.23 × 10–4), IPA (6.61 × 10–4), PEG-400 (5.64 ×
10–4), ethanol (4.98 × 10–4), PG (3.26 × 10–4), methanol (3.38 ×
10–4), EG (1.37 × 10–4),
and water (1.98 × 10–4) at T = 318.2 K. The xe values of GLZ were
significantly higher in DMSO in comparison to other neat solvents
evaluated (P < 0.05). The solubility values of
GLZ in various alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, IPA, EG, PG, 1-butanol,
and 2-butanol were not significantly different, which could be possible
due to their similar polarities and Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs).

The highest solubilities of GLZ in DMSO were possible due to the
fact that different solubility parameters of DMSO were more close
to that of GLZ in comparison to other neat solvents evaluated. Based
on the present results, GLZ has been considered as freely soluble
in DMSO; slightly soluble in THP, EA, PEG-400, 2-butanol, 1-butanol,
IPA, ethanol, methanol EG, and PG; and practically insoluble in water.30

2.3 Computational Approach
for Calculation of
Various Solubility Parameters
Different solubility parameters
including HSPs of GLZ and 12 different neat solvents are tabulated
in Table 2. The HSPs
of GLZ and neat solvents were calculated using “HSPiP software”.
Total HSP for GLZ was found as 31.10 MPa1/2, suggesting
that GLZ had medium polarity. Although some solvents such as EG (total
HSP = 31.60 MPa1/2), methanol (total HSP = 30.30 MPa1/2), and PG (total HSP = 29.20 MPa1/2) have total
HSP very close to that of the GLZ, the experimental solubility of
GLZ was much lower in these solvents. This observation might be due
to the fact that dispersion, polar, and hydrogen-bonded HSPs of GLZ
were much different from EG, methanol, and PG. Moreover, three-dimensional
solubility parameter space (Ra) was recorded
>15.0 MPa1/2 in all neat solvents except DMSO, suggesting
a weak solubility of GLZ in these solvents. The literature suggests
that the solvents/excipients with Ra <
5.6 MPa1/2 are the most compatible for solubility of drugs.31,32 Although none of the studied neat solvents had Ra value in the above-said range, DMSO (Ra = 8.08 MPa1/2) was found to be the closest
to the above-said range. Hence, the maximum solubility of GLZ was
considered in DMSO. The “Van Krevelen and Hoftyzer”
solubility parameter (Δδ̅) was also obtained >15.0
MPa1/2 in many neat solvents, including water, EG, methanol,
PG, IPA, 1-butanol, 2-butanol and EA, suggesting the poor solubility
of GLZ in these neat solvents. The literature suggests that the materials
with Δδ̅ < 5.0 MPa1/2 could be the
most compatible for solubility of drugs and pharmaceuticals.33,34 Only DMSO (Δδ̅ = 7.21 MPa1/2) was found
to be closest to the above-said range. Other solubility parameters,
namely, Greenhalgh’s solubility parameter (Δδ),
were estimated to be higher in water, PEG-400, EA, and THP, suggesting
the weak solubility of GLZ in these neat solvents. The literature
suggests that the materials with Δδ < 7.0 MPa1/2 could be the most compatible for solubility of drugs and pharmaceuticas.35 Many solvents such as methanol, ethanol, EG,
PG, and DMSO have Δδ < 7.0 MPa1/2. According
to Greenhalgh’s theory, the neat solvents methanol, ethanol,
EG, PG, and DMSO were suitable for solubility with GLZ. Overall, DMSO
was selected the best solvent for solubility of GLZ.

a These values were calculated between
GLZ and respective neat solvent.

2.4 Ideal Solubilities and Activity Coefficients
The objective of determining the activity coefficient was to study
the interactions between the GLZ and various neat solvents at molecular
level to obtain the best solvent for solubility of GLZ. Activity coefficient
is related to the ideal solubility of the drug, and hence the ideal
solubility of GLZ was also determined. Hence, the ideal solubility
and activity coefficients of GLZ were determined to obtain the best
solvent for GLZ. The ideal solubility (xidl) values for crystalline GLZ are tabulated in Table 1. The xidl values
were recorded in the range of 4.88 × 10–4–1.35
× 10–3 at T = 298.2–318.2
K. The xidl values of GLZ were slightly
lower than its experimental solubilities in THP but slightly higher
than methanol, PG, ethanol, IPA, PEG-400, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, and
EA. However, the xidl values of GLZ were
significantly higher than its experimental solubilities in water and
EG (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the xidl values of GLZ were found to be significantly
lower than its experimental solubilities in DMSO (P < 0.05). Therefore, DMSO was found as the best solvent for solubility
of GLZ.

The activity coefficient (γi) values
for GLZ in 12 different neat solvents at T = 298.2–318.2
K are listed in Table 3.

DMSO	0.028	0.032	0.036	0.042	0.048	
The γi values for GLZ were calculated as <1.0
in DMSO and THP at all five temperature points studied. However, the
γi value for GLZ was found to be significantly larger
in water, EG, methanol, PG, ethanol, IPA, and PEG-400. On the other
hand, the γi value for GLZ was found to be >1.0
but
<2.0 in 1-butanol, 2-butanol, and EA. The γi values
of GLZ in all investigated neat solvents were not increased/decreased
significantly with respect to temperature (P >
0.05).
Based on the estimated values of γi, the maximum
solute–solvent molecular interactions were found in GLZ–DMSO
in comparison to other combinations of GLZ and neat solvent.

2.5 Computational Approaches for Solubility Correlation
Experimental solubilities of GLZ were validated and correlated
with two computational models, namely, “Apelblat and van’t
Hoff models”.36−38 The graphical correlation between ln xe and ln Apelblat solubility (xApl) values of GLZ in 12 different neat solvents against
1/T is summarized in Figure 3, which suggests a good correlation between
the ln xe and ln xApl values of GLZ in all 12 different neat solvents.
The results of “Apelblat correlation” are listed in Table 4. The root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) values for GLZ in 12 different neat solvents were
calculated as (0.43–2.24)% with an overall RMSD of 1.06%. The
regressed values of coefficient of determination (R2) for GLZ in 12 different neat solvents were estimated
as 0.9982–0.9999. The higher values of R2 and lower values of RMSD showed a good correlation of the xe values of GLZ with the “Apelblat model”.

The graphical correlation between xe and van’t Hoff solubility (xvan’t) values of GLZ in 12 different
neat solvents against 1/T is summarized in the Supporting
Information (Figure S1), which also shows
a good correlation between xe and xvan’t values of GLZ. The results of “van’t
Hoff correlation”
are listed in Table 5. The values of RMSD for GLZ in 12 different neat solvents were obtained
as (0.46–3.16)% with an overall RMSD of 1.40%. The regressed R2 values for GLZ in 12 different neat solvents
were estimated as 0.9954–0.9997. The higher values of R2 and lower values of RMSD again showed a good
correlation of xe values of GLZ with “van’t
Hoff model”.

2.6 Thermodynamic Analysis
The estimated
values of three different thermodynamic parameters and R2 for GLZ dissolution are summarized in Table 6. The “apparent standard
enthalpy (ΔsolH0) values”
for GLZ dissolution in 12 different neat solvents were found as (18.87–55.21)
kJ mol–1. The maximum “ΔsolH0 value” of GLZ was recorded
in water (55.21 kJ mol–1) with the minimum one in
DMSO (18.87 kJ mol–1). The minimum ΔsolH0 value of GLZ in DMSO was possibly
due to the highest solubility of GLZ in DMSO. The ΔsolH0 values of GLZ were generally higher
in neat solvents with poor solubilities. The “apparent standard
Gibbs free energy (ΔsolG0) values” for GLZ dissolution were found as (9.75–35.30)
kJ mol–1. The “ΔsolG0 value” of GLZ was also found to be
minimum in DMSO (9.75 kJ mol–1) and maximum in water
(35.30 kJ mol–1), due to the highest and lowest
solubilities of GLZ in DMSO and water, respectively. The positive
values of “ΔsolH0 and ΔsolG0”
for GLZ dissolution in all neat solvents indicated an “endothermic
dissolution” of GLZ.36,39 The “apparent
standard entropy (ΔsolS0) values” for GLZ dissolution were found as (29.60–91.22)
J mol–1 K–1, indicating an “entropy-driven
dissolution” of GLZ in all 12 different neat solvents.40 The average relative uncertainties in ΔsolH0, ΔsolG0, and ΔsolS0 for GLZ were obtained as 0.22, 0.33, and 0.26, respectively.
Overall, the dissolution behavior of GLZ was found as an “endothermic
and entropy-driven”.39,40

3 Conclusions
Both experimental and computational
approaches were used for the
solubility determination of a poorly soluble antidiabetic drug GLZ
in 12 different neat solvents in the proposed study. Different solubility
parameters including HSPs were calculated to find the best solvent
for GLZ. Experimental solubilities of GLZ were determined at T = 298.2–318.2 K and p = 0.1 MPa.
The experimental solubilities of GLZ were validated/correlated well
with “van’t Hoff and Apelblat” models. The solubility
of GLZ was enhanced significantly with the rise in temperature (P < 0.05). The data of activity coefficients showed maximum
solute–solvent interactions in GLZ–DMSO in comparison
to other combinations of solute and solvent. The solubility of GLZ
was recorded in the order of DMSO > THP > EA > 2-butanol
> 1-butanol
> IPA > PEG-400 > ethanol > PG > methanol > EG >
water at T = 318.2 K. Apparent thermodynamic analysis
showed an “endothermic
and entropy-driven dissolution” of GLZ in all 12 different
neat solvents. Based on various factors such as maximum solubility,
lower solubility parameters, lower activity coefficients, and lowest
values of apparent standard enthalpies and Gibbs energies, DMSO has
been considered as the best solvent for solubility of GLZ.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
THP
was obtained from “Gattefosse
(Lyon, France)”. GLZ, ethanol, IPA, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, EG,
PG, PEG-400, EA, and DMSO were procured from “E-Merck (Darmstadt,
Germany)”. Methanol was obtained from “BDH PROLABO (Leuven,
Belgium)”. The purified water was obtained by “Milli-Q
water purifier (Millipore, Lyon, France)”. The detailed information
of different materials is summarized in Table S1.

4.2 Quantification of GLZ
“Waters
Acquity H-class Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC)”
equipment equipped with a “Waters diode array-ultraviolet (DAD-UV)
detector (Acquity UPLC, Waters, MA)” was used to quantify GLZ
in this study. The proposed UPLC system contains “quaternary
solvent manager, sample manager (Acquity, UPLC Waters, MA) and a column
heater”. The injection volume capacity was 10 μL. The
separation of GLZ was executed using “Acquity UPLC BEH C18
column (2.1 × 50 mm2, 1.7 μm, Waters)”
maintained at T = 303.2 ± 1 K. The proposed
UPLC-UV technique was used to quantify GLZ with some modifications
in the reported HPLC-UV methods.41−44 In the proposed analytical methodology,
the mobile phase (composed of 80:20, v/v methanol and 10 mM KH2PO4 buffer of pH 4.2 adjusted with orthophosphoric
acid) was flowed with an isocratic mode. The flow rate and injection
volume were set at 0.08 mL min–1 and 5 μL,
respectively. The total time for analysis was 3 min. The quantification
of GLZ was performed in the UV mode at λmax = 230
nm. The retention time of GLZ was recorded as 1.684 min. “EMPOWER
software” was utilized for data analysis and interpretation.

The standard stock solution (SSS) of GLZ (200 μg g–1) was prepared in methanol by using DMSO as a co-solvent. From SSS,
the serial dilutions were made to obtain the concentration in the
range of 0.5–100 μg g–1. The calibration
curve was obtained between the concentrations of GLZ (μg g–1) and the peak areas of GLZ obtained through UPLC-UV
analysis. The calibration curve of GLZ was found to be linear in the
above concentration range with R2 of 0.9999.
The straight-line (regressed) equation for the calibration data was
found to be Y = 184 862x –
26 911, where Y is the peak UPLC area for
GLZ and x is the concentration of GLZ.

4.3 Characterization of GLZ in Solid States
The characterization
of GLZ in solid states was done by DSC. “DSC-8000
Instrument (PerkinElmer)” equipped with chiller (T = 253.2 K) and autosampler was used for this experiment. For DSC
analysis, approximately 4.50 mg of pure GLZ and 3.90 mg of equilibrated
GLZ samples were put into aluminum pans and the pans were sealed hermetically.
DSC thermograms of the pure and equilibrated GLZ samples were obtained
under a nitrogen purge of 20 mL min–1 at the heating
rate of 10 K min–1, and the temperature range was
kept from 298.2 to 623.2 K for pure GLZ and from 301.2 to 633.2 K
for equilibrated GLZ. DSC analysis was done to investigate various
thermal parameters and possible transformations (if any) of GLZ. DSC
was done on initial material (pure GLZ) as well as on the equilibrated
GLZ sample obtained from equilibrium sample (EA) by evaporating the
solvent at T = 298.2 K.40,45

4.4 Experimental Approach for Solubility Determination
The solubility of GLZ in all studied solvents was determined using
an experimental approach such as the “isothermal saturation
shake flask method” at T = 298.2–318.2
K and p = 0.1 MPa.46 The
operational conditions and experimental procedures were same as mentioned
in our previous work.40,45 Therefore, the experimental details
are not included in the present study. Experiments were carried out
in triplicate manner (n = 3). The content of GLZ
in the solubility samples of 12 different neat solvents was analyzed
by the UPLC-UV technique described above at λmax = 230 nm. The content of GLZ (μg g–1) was estimated using a calibration curve of GLZ. The xe values of GLZ were calculated by applying eq 1(26,27) 1  where m1 = mass
of GLZ; m2 = mass of neat solvent; M1 = molar mass of GLZ; and M2 = molar mass of neat solvent.

4.5 Computational
Approaches for Determination
of Solubility Parameters
If the solubility parameter of drug
is close to that of neat solvent, then it will show the maximum solubility
in that solvent.47 To obtain the best solvent
for the solubility of GLZ, different solubility parameters for GLZ
and 12 different neat solvents were estimated using various computational
approaches. The HSP (δ) value was obtained by applying eq 2(47−49) 2  where δ = total HSP; δd = dispersion HSP;
δp = polar HSP, and δh = hydrogen-bonded
HSP. The data of δ HSP, δd HSP, δp HSP, and δh HSP
for GLZ and 12 different neat solvents were calculated using “HSPiP
software (version 4.1.07, Louisville, KY)” by taking smiles
of GLZ and each solvent into the software.

The Δδ̅
value was calculated using eq 3(33,49) 3  It has been
reported that the possibility
of solubility between the drug and solvent is maximum if the value
of Δδ̅ < 5.0 MPa1/2.33,34

The Bagley solubility parameter (δv) was
estimated
by applying eq 4(50) 4  By applying
the Bagley concept, Ra was estimated by
applying eq 5(31) 5  where Ra indicates
the solubility between the drug and neat solvent. For the maximum
solubility, the value of Ra should be
<5.6 MPa1/2.31,32

The Δδ
value was estimated by applying eq 6(35) 6  According to this concept, the solubility
between the drug and solvents is maximum at Δδ < 7.0
MPa1/2, while the value of Δδ > 10.0 MPa1/2 has been considered for immiscibility between the drug
and solvents.35

4.6 Ideal
Solubilities and Activity Coefficients
The xidl value of GLZ was calculated
by applying eq 7(51) 7  where R = universal gas constant; Tfus = fusion temperature of GLZ; ΔHfus = fusion enthalpy of GLZ; and ΔCp = the difference in molar heat capacity of
the solid state with that of liquid state.51,52 It has been assumed that ΔCp can
be set approximately as the entropy of fusion (ΔSfus), and hence, ΔCp = ΔSfus.51,53 The ΔCp value for GLZ was estimated
by applying eq 8(51) 8  The Tfus and ΔHfus values for GLZ were determined as 484.21
K and 63.33 kJ mol–1, respectively, from thermal
evaluation. Using eq 8, the ΔCp value of GLZ was calculated
as 130.79 J mol–1 K–1. The xidl values for GLZ were estimated now by using eq 7.

The γi values for GLZ in 12 different neat solvents were estimated
by applying eq 9(51,53) 9  

4.7 Computational Approaches for Solubility Correlation
Various computational approaches were used for the validation of
experimental solubility data. Hence, the experimental solubilities
of GLZ in 12 different neat solvents were correlated by applying two
computational approaches, namely, Apelblat and van’t Hoff models.36−38 “Apelblat model solubility (xApl)” of GLZ was calculated using the modified Apelblat model
by applying eq 10(37,38) 10  where “A, B, and C” are the parameters
of
the Apelblat model, which were estimated by applying “nonlinear
multivariate regression analysis” of the xe values of GLZ tabulated in Table 1.36 The xe and xApl values
of GLZ were correlated using the RMSD and R2 values. The RMSD for GLZ was estimated by applying eq 11 11  where N = number of experimental
data points.

The xvan’t value
of GLZ was calculated using the “van’t Hoff”
model by applying eq 12(36) 12  where a and b are the parameters of the van’t Hoff model. These parameters
were estimated by plotting the ln xe values of GLZ against 1/T.

4.8 Thermodynamic
Analysis
To calculate
different thermodynamics parameters of GLZ in 12 different neat solvents,
an apparent thermodynamic analysis was carried out. Three different
thermodynamic parameters, such as ΔsolH0, ΔsolG0, and ΔsolS0, for the
GLZ dissolution were estimated by applying the “van’t
Hoff and Krug et al. analysis”.51,54,55 The ΔsolH0 values for the GLZ dissolution in 12 different neat solvents were
estimated at “mean harmonic temperature (Thm)” of 308 K by “van’t Hoff analysis”
by applying eq 13(51,54) 13  The ΔsolH0 values were obtained by the
van’t Hoff plots
made between the ln xe values of
GLZ and 1/T – 1/Thm.

The ΔsolG0 values
for the GLZ dissolution in 12 different neat solvents were also estimated
at Thm of 308 K using the “Krug
et al. analysis” by applying eq 14(55) 14  where the intercept values for GLZ in 12 different
neat solvents were estimated from the “van’t Hoff plot”
shown in Figure S2.

Finally, the
“ΔsolS0 values”
for the GLZ dissolution were estimated by
applying eq 15(51,54,55) 15  

4.9 Statistical Analysis
Experimental
solubility data of GLZ were compared by applying the “Kruskal–Wallis
analysis” followed by “Denn’s test” using
“GraphPad In Stat software (San Diego, CA)”. The estimated
values of P < 0.05 were considered as statistically
significant.
