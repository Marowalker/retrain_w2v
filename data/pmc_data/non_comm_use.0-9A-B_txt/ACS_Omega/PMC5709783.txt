Gelatin–hyaluronic acid (Gel–HA)
hybrid hydrogels
have been proposed as matrices for tissue engineering because of their
ability to mimic the architecture of the extracellular matrix. Our
aim was to explore whether tyramine conjugates of Gel and HA, producing
injectable hydrogels, are able to induce a particular phenotype of
encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells without the need for growth
factors. While pure Gel allowed good cell adhesion without remarkable
differentiation and pure HA triggered chondrogenic differentiation
without cell spreading, the hybrids, especially those rich in HA,
promoted chondrogenic differentiation as well as cell proliferation
and adhesion. Secretion of chondrogenic markers such as aggrecan,
SOX-9, collagen type II, and glycosaminoglycans was observed, whereas
osteogenic, myogenic, and adipogenic markers (RUNX2, sarcomeric myosin,
and lipoproteinlipase, respectively) were not present after 2 weeks
in the growth medium. The most promising matrix for chondrogenesis
seems to be a mixture containing 70% HA and 30% Gel as it is the material
with the best mechanical properties from all compositions tested here,
and at the same time, it provides an environment suitable for balanced
cell adhesion and chondrogenic differentiation. Thus, it represents
a system that has a high potential to be used as the injectable material
for cartilage regeneration therapies.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Many
tissues in the human body are not able to properly repair
themselves or can only repair small injuries, as in the case, for
example, of skin,1 heart,2 and cartilage.3 Tissue engineering
looks for solutions to these problems by using materials or scaffolds
as supports for the formation of new tissue. Before transplantation,
these scaffolds can either be seeded with differentiated or undifferentiated
cells or be acellular if neighboring cells can migrate to the site
of the implant inside the material. Other factors (e.g., growth factors)
or stimuli (e.g., mechanical, electrical, or magnetic forces) can
be applied to the scaffold-cell system to induce cell differentiation
and promote tissue repair.4

In this
study, we focus on material systems that recapitulate the
properties of soft tissues (e.g., cartilage, muscle, etc.). The cells
in these tissues are within a highly hydrated extracellular matrix
(ECM), which contains glycoproteins (such as collagen, elastin, and
fibronectin) and glycosaminoglycans [GAGs, such as hyaluronic acid
(HA), chondroitin 6-sulfate, and keratan sulfate], with a composition
and topology that is tissue-specific.5 For
this, we synthesized injectable hydrogels by combining different proportions
of gelatin (Gel) and HA, which are able to enzymatically cross-link.
Gel is obtained by denaturation of collagen and has accessible functional
groups that can react with other molecules. It contains the RGD sequence,
which allows integrin-mediated adhesion.6 HA is characterized by its high hydrophilicity, good lubrication
capacity due to its high water sorption and retention, good biocompatibility,
and low cell and protein adhesive properties.7

Different options have been studied for the cross-linking
or functionalization
of HA and Gel hydrogels by forming covalent bonds. These can be classified
into three groups: chemical, photochemical, or enzymatic cross-linking.8−11 Both chemical and photochemical cross-linking can produce inflammation
and cell death, and their surgical procedure is more invasive than
that required for enzymatic cross-linking,12,13 which allows in situ hydrogel formation; the precursor solutions
can be injected directly into the defect, where the enzyme starts
cross-linking without causing any cytotoxic effects.14

Previous studies combining Gel and HA have demonstrated
their noncytotoxicity
and potential for cell adhesion and spreading.7,15,16 Chen et al. embedded nucleus pulposus (NP)
cells in chemically cross-linked Gel–HA hydrogels for 1 week,
and their results showed good cell proliferation and cell synthesis
of collagen type II, aggrecan, and Sry-type high mobility group box
transcription factor 9 (SOX-9) (chondrogenic markers), biglycan and
decorin (proteoglycans for ECM integrity), and hypoxia-inducing factor-1
(marker of NP cells).16 Camci-Unal et al.
cultured human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells in methacrylated
mixtures of Gel–HA, obtaining different cellular responses
by changing the concentration of each component.17 These two references are examples of injectable materials
(see also refs (18) and (19)), which
intend to mimic the composition of the natural ECM by mixing Gel and
HA in different proportions. The most explored application of these
systems has been in articular cartilage, likely due to the potential
of HA to support chondrogenesis.20 However,
none of these studies explored the application of these Gel–HA
systems to trigger mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation. Rather,
they revealed that encapsulated chondrocytes kept their phenotype
within the gels but only in media containing chondrogenic growth factors,
such as TGF-β3.16,19 Other similar systems (collagen
type II-HA or HA–Gel), which are based on noninjectable chemistries,
have been used to investigate MSC differentiation in combination with
chondrogenic growth factors.11,21 Only a few reports
focused on the intrinsic chondrogenic potential of the matrices in
the absence of growth factors, as was the case with the collagen type
II-HA scaffolds reported by Murphy et al.22 or the cartilage decellularized ECM investigated by Burnsed et al.23 However, these are noninjectable preformed scaffolds
obtained by lyophilization or solvent casting of aqueous solutions
of macromolecules, followed by cross-linking.11,21,22 This initial drying not only generates some
porosity but also triggers the organization of the macromolecules
in a way that is very different from the one obtained in injectable
hydrogels and which is kept after the addition of the cross-linker.
Equilibrium water content (EWC), mechanical properties, and the way
the cells interact with these hydrogels are very different from those
of injectable hydrogels.24 Therefore, the
results obtained on MSC differentiation in noninjectable hydrogels
cannot be extrapolated to injectable hydrogels.

Encouraged by
the positive results obtained in our previous work
in enzymatically cross-linked Gel–HA hydrogels on myoblast
differentiation,25 in this work, we evaluate
the influence of hydrogel composition (proportion of Gel and HA) on
the differentiation of human MSCs (hMSCs) in the absence of growth
factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
injectable Gel–HA hydrogels have been investigated as matrices
for MSC differentiation without the addition of exogenous factors.
The hydrogels are firstly physically characterized (rheology, swelling,
and in vitro degradation), and their differentiation potential is
then studied with encapsulated hMSCs. We assess whether the combination
of both materials leads to an environment that promotes cell differentiation
more efficiently than pure components in a growth medium (GM), that
is, absence of specific complements such as growth factors.

2 Results
Tyramine conjugates of Gel and HA form hydrogels
by the covalent
bond of the phenol groups of tyramine when horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) are added.27 When both the conjugates are mixed, hydrogels with different amounts
of Gel and HA are obtained by the random reaction of Gel–HA,
HA–HA, or Gel–Gel chains, as illustrated in Figure 1. Gelation times
range from 2 to 4.5 min, with an increase in the gelation time with
the increase in the HA content.25 Gelation
time in tyramine conjugates and other similar injectable hydrogels
is usually not affected by the incorporation of cells,28 and we did not observe any significant change
in the presence of cells. However, to ensure complete cross-linking
of the hydrogels in the cell culture experiments, they were kept for
30 minutes at 37 °C before the addition of the culture medium.
Successful tyramine grafting, tyramine substitution degree, and mean
molecular weight of the tyramine conjugates of Gel and HA were determined
by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy,
and size exclusion chromatography, and the details can be found in
our previous publications.25,29

Figure 1 Enzymatic reaction of
Gel–tyramine and HA–tyramine
grafted composites by HRP and H2O2. When both
the tyramine conjugates are mixed, random cross-linking reactions
between Gel chains, HA chains, or Gel–HA chains are produced.

2.1 Mechanical Properties
The shear modulus
of the already cross-linked samples was measured. First, a strain
sweep measurement was carried out to obtain the hydrogel linear viscoelastic
range.30 No noticeable change was observed
in |G*| with the strain amplitude throughout the
whole amplitude strain range swept (0.01–15%) in any of the
gels (Figure S1). As can be seen, |G*| increases with the HA ratio, which has been reported
previously in similar systems.18 As a trade-off
between linearity and noise, subsequent dynamic frequency sweep tests
were performed for 1% strain. The dependence of G′ and G″ on the frequency for the
hybrid gels has been plotted in Figures 2A and 2B, respectively.
The storage modulus is the dominant contribution to |G*| because G′ ≫ G″ in all gels, as has also been reported in thiolated Gel–HA
hydrogels18 and in oxidized HA–Gel–adipic
acid dihydrazide hydrogels.16 No significant
dependence of G′ on the frequency is observed
for the experimental range of frequency swept. Again, the higher the
ratio of HA in the hybrid gel the higher the storage modulus. No noticeable
change was found in the loss modulus (with a value around 1 Pa, regardless
of the gel composition) until 2–3 Hz, but it did increase at
higher frequencies.

hydrogels (1% strain). All measurements were carried out at 37 °C.

(initial) and after 20–30% of degradation of the matrix (20–30%).
Legend in (B) is also valid for (A,C).

The value of G′ at 1 Hz appeared
in the
range of several hundreds of Pa and increased with the percentage
of HA from 172 to 789 Pa for pure Gel and HA, respectively (Table 1). Although the rheological
properties of hydrogels were determined in the absence of cells, no
changes in the shear storage moduli are expected when cells are incorporated.
This was demonstrated by Kolesky et al.31 using fibroblasts in methacrylated Gel and by Moshayedi et al.32 using neural progenitor cells in methacrylated
HA. As far as the loss factor is concerned, an extremely low value
(about 0.1°) was found for all hybrid gels, indicating a highly
elastic energy storing capacity (Table 1).

2.2 Enzymatic Degradation of Gel–HA Hydrogels
The degradation of Gel–HA hydrogels was studied by enzymatic
degradation with a 10 U/mL solution of hyaluronidase and 3 U/mL of
collagenase in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS),
these concentrations being within the range typically used before.11,17,33,34 A mixture of both the enzymes was used to reproduce a more relevant
physiological environment than just using a single enzyme.7 Degradation kinetics was studied as the mass
lost with time of immersion in the degradation solution (see Figure 2C). The Gel hydrogel
degraded very rapidly; after 7 h, there was no hydrogel left, whereas
a longer time (5 days) was needed for HA. This trend has previously
been reported by other authors.7 Gel–HA
hybrids needed intermediate times to degrade. 70/30 and 50/50 Gel–HA
hydrogels showed a degradation profile similar to the Gel hydrogel,
and 30/70 fully degraded after 28 h. These revealed an important role
of Gel in accelerating degradation (even with only 30% of Gel in the
gel) in comparison to pure HA. A reason for this could be that in
hybrid gels, Gel is first degraded by collagenase, leaving spaces
between some of the HA chains that improve the accessibility for hyaluronidase
to degrade this component faster than in the bare HA hydrogel (0/100).

To better understand how degradation influences the hydrogel structure,
the EWC of different hydrogels at 20–30% degradation was compared
with the EWC of hydrogels with no degradation (Figure 2D, Table 2). Initial hydrogel swelling showed an increased water
uptake with the higher HA content. This higher swelling is usually
related to the lower cross-linking density of the polymeric network
and chemical characteristics of the polymeric structure.6,7 EWC is increased in all compositions studied after degradation,
except in the case of pure HA.

2.3 hMSCs Proliferation
Cells encapsulated
within the hydrogels were viable during the time of the experiment,
as demonstrated by the LIVE/DEAD assay on day 14 (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). Cell morphology was
monitored during the cell culture experiment on days 2, 7, and 14
under the microscope. Figure 3 represents gels with embedded cells after 2 weeks in both
culture media [GM and chondrogenic medium (CM)]; the details for the
entire experiment (2, 7, and 14 days) are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S3.1 and S3.2).
In the Gel hydrogel, the cells adhered and showed an elongated morphology
in both culture media (GM and CM) from day 2 (Figures S3.1 and S3.2). In the case of HA and Gel–HA
mixtures, the cells remained rounded on day 2 after seeding (Figures S3.1 and S3.2). In the GM, 70/30 and
50/50 hybrids started to show elongated and better attached cells
on day 7 (Figure S3.1), whereas 30/70 hydrogel
facilitated cell-spreading later on as some elongated cells were observed
on day 14 (Figures 3 and S3.1). In the CM, some cell elongation
could be seen after 7 days of culture in Gel–HA hybrids (Figure S3.2). The pure HA hydrogel did not allow
good cell attachment and spreading in any of the cell culture media,
and the cells remained rounded during the entire experiment (Figures S3.1 and S3.2).

Figure 3 Phase contrast images
of Gel−HA hydrogels with hMSCs cultured
in GM and CM for 14 days. The scale bar is 100 μm.

3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay (Figure 4) demonstrated that the cells did not proliferate
in Gel in any of the culture media (GM and CM). However, a significant
proliferation was measured for the hybrid gels in the GM (Figure 4A). In the case of
pure HA, no proliferation was observed in the GM, and the number of
cells diminished with the culture time, probably due to cell migration
out of the hydrogel because of poor cell adhesion (Figure 4A). The presence of proliferating
cells in the Gel–HA mixtures together with the results of the
LIVE/DEAD assay showing a homogenous distribution of viable cells
across the gel volume on day 14 (Figure S2) suggest that there was no significant limitation in the nutrient
supply, even to the central part of the gels.

Figure 4 Cell proliferation in
Gel–HA hydrogels measured by the MTS
assay in the GM (A) and CM (B). The samples were compared by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA), and statistical differences at p < 0.05 are denoted by *, both in each Gel–HA
proportion at the different time points and among the different Gel–HA
compositions at the same time point.

As expected, proliferation was suppressed in all hydrogels
in the
CM (Figure 4B), and
the number of cells slightly decreased with the culture time for those
hydrogels rich in HA (50/50, 30/70, and 0/100).

2.4 hMSCs Differentiation
hMSCs were
encapsulated in the hydrogels to determine whether spontaneous differentiation
toward specific lineages (myogenic, adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic)
can occur in the absence of a differentiation medium.

Immunofluorescence
images after 14 days of culture for the adipogenic marker lipoproteinlipase
(LPL), osteogenic marker RUNX2, and myogenic marker MF20 in Figure 5 suggest that no
differentiation toward these cell lineages could be seen in the GM
in any of the Gel–HA hydrogels.

Figure 5 Immunofluorescence images
for LPL, RUNX2, and MF20 of hMSCs cultured
in Gel–HA hydrogels and in the GM for 14 days. Nuclei are stained
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), cytoskeleton is
stained in green, and the different antibodies are stained in red.
The scale bar is 50 μm.

Aggrecan was studied as a well-accepted marker for chondrogenic
differentiation. Aggrecan fluorescence staining was performed for
all Gel–HA compositions both in the GM (Figure 6) and CM (Figure S4.1) after 14 days of culture. MSCs cultured in Gel showed a negligible
expression of aggrecan, whereas the presence of HA stimulates the
expression of this marker for all compositions.35

Figure 6 Immunofluorescence images for aggrecan (Agg) and SOX-9 of hMSCs
cultured in Gel–HA hydrogels and in the GM for 14 days. Nuclei
are stained with DAPI in blue, cytoskeleton is stained in green for
Agg pictures and in red for SOX-9 pictures, aggrecan is stained in
red, and SOX-9 is stained in green. The scale bar is 50 μm.

As the hydrogel mixtures and HA
seemed to promote chondrogenic
phenotype, other chondrogenic markers were analyzed to further study
these hydrogels: SOX-9 and alcian blue staining and gene expression
for collagen type II in the GM and CM.

Figure 6 shows SOX-9
for cells cultured in all Gel–HA compositions in the GM (those
in the CM are represented in Figure S4.2), confirming the positive results of aggrecan staining.

Alcian
blue histologies are depicted in Figure 7, where glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are stained
in blue, cells are stained in red, and the background is pink or becomes
purple when the quantity of HA is increased (background of the different
hydrogel compositions without cells can be seen in the figure as the
acellular control). As expected, dark blue staining of cells in the
CM shows the presence of GAGs in all hydrogels. In the Gel hydrogel,
the blue color appears less dark and more spread than in the other
gels, which could be caused by better cell adhesion associated with
a higher Gel degradation rate that increases the cells’ capacity
to synthesize the ECM (including GAGs) into larger areas. For the
cells cultured in the GM, images obtained for the Gel hydrogel did
not contain any blue, indicating that no GAGs were synthesized under
this condition. In the case of Gel–HA and pure HA, blue areas
were observed around the cells (white arrows in Figure 7), confirming the presence of GAGs in these
gels.

Figure 7 Alcian blue histologies with nuclear fast red staining of hMSCs
cultured in Gel–HA hydrogels and in the GM and CM for 14 days
with scale bar 50 μm. White arrows indicate cells producing
GAGs for the samples cultured in the GM. Acellular controls show the
alcian blue histologies for the different hydrogels without cells;
here the scale bar corresponds to 100 μm.

Expression of collagen type II encoded by COL2A1 gene determined
by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is shown in Figure 8A. The results are
represented as a fold change in the expression relative to pure Gel
gels in the GM, to which a value of 1 was assigned in the graph. In
the GM, the cells within those hydrogels rich in HA, 30/70, and pure
HA express a significantly higher amount of collagen type II than
Gel in the GM. The same occurs in the CM, where the expression is
significantly higher compared to the GM for almost all samples, except
for the 70/30 sample.

Gel–HA hydrogels and cultured in the GM and CM for 14 days.
(A) Relative collagen type II gene expression from qPCR, represented
as a change in the expression relative to Gel in the GM, to which
a value of 1 was assigned in the graph. One-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test
was performed to find statistical differences; * for p < 0.05, ** for p < 0.01, and *** for p < 0.005. (B) Percentage of positive cells for aggrecan.
Mann–Whitney–Wilconson test demonstrated that groups
within a type of culture medium show statistically significant differences
between each other, except those marked with “ns” (not
significant). (C) Percentage of positive cells for SOX-9 obtained
from the immunofluorescence images. One-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test
was applied for samples cultured in the CM, and Kruskal–Wallis
nonparametric test was applied for samples cultured in the CM. * for p < 0.05, ** for p < 0.01, and ***
for p < 0.005. (D) Percentage of cells expressing
GAGs calculated from alcian blue images. Mann−Whitney−Wilconson
test demonstrated that groups within a type of culture medium show
statistically significant differences between each other, except those
marked with “ns” (not significant).

To quantify the levels of other chondrogenic markers already
observed,
immunofluorescence images as well as histological stainings were further
processed to calculate the percentage of cells expressing aggrecan,
SOX-9, and GAGs; the resulting graphs are shown in Figure 8.

Regarding the percentage
of aggrecan expression (Figure 8B), again the presence of higher
amounts of HA in the hydrogel composition increases the percentage
of cells expressing aggrecan. In both CM and GM cultures, statistically
significant differences were obtained between all groups, except between
the 50/50 and 30/70 Gel–HA samples. The highest percentage
of differentiation was obtained for pure HA hydrogel (0/100) cultured
in the GM, with 79%. This value was higher than that obtained for
the 0/100 sample cultured in the CM (24%), although the number of
cells in this hydrogel is quite low compared with all other hydrogel
compositions. Gel–HA 50/50 and 30/70 hybrids present similar
percentages of aggrecan differentiation with 56% for the CM culture
and 31% for the GM culture.

Aggrecan immunofluorescence images
were also used to calculate
the number of cells per area (Figure S5A), which gives us an idea of cell distribution within the different
hydrogels. The number of cells per area was seen to increase with
the quantity of Gel in the hydrogel, although there is a marked drop
in the number of cells when HA is present in the hydrogel composition.
Comparing 100/0 and 70/30 hydrogels, there is a decrease of 66% for
cells in the GM and 76% for cells in the CM. No significant statistical
differences were obtained between the 70/30 and 50/50 hydrogels in
either CM or GM or between the 50/50 and 30/70 hydrogels cultured
in the GM.

As regards the percentage of SOX-9 (Figure 8C) in the CM, more than 75%
of the cells
are positive in all Gel–HA mixtures and HA (with no significant
differences among the different hydrogels), whereas only 25% of the
cells are positive in pure Gel. The percentage of positive SOX-9 cells
in the GM is always higher than 45% and increases with the amount
of HA in the mixtures, showing statistically significant higher values
for those hydrogels rich in HA, 30/70, and HA samples.

The quantitative
analysis of the alcian blue staining allowed us
to calculate the percentage of cells expressing GAGs (Figure 8D), which was complemented
with the qualitative analysis determining the dark blue tone or level
and the blue area around the cell (Figure S5B). In the cell–hydrogel system cultured in the GM, the percentage
of cells synthesizing GAGs increased with the percentage of HA in
the hydrogel up to values of about 80% in the 30/70 mixture and HA
gel. No GAG expression was detected in the case of Gel in the GM.
A high percentage of cells (around 90%) cultured in the five types
of Gel–HA in the CM synthesized GAGs. In the qualitative analysis,
a smaller and darker area around the cell was obtained with increased
HA content in the GM, indicating a higher concentration of GAGs around
the cell (Figure S5B).

3 Discussion
Our study demonstrates that a combination of
tyramine conjugates
of Gel with tyramine conjugates of HA produces injectable hydrogels
with an enhanced shear modulus and hydration and where chondrogenesis
of MSCs without the need for growth factors is stimulated. This is
demonstrated by an increased expression of aggrecan, SOX-9, collagen
type II, and GAGs. The importance of having hydrogels that do not
need the supplement of growth factors in tissue-engineering applications
is multiple. As described in refs (23) and (36), chondrogenic growth factors can also induce osteogenesis;
therapies based on them are cost inefficient and not clinically attractive;37 and the release of growth factors from hydrogels
is usually not sustained unless they are chemically modified.20

Similar analogs of the ECM based on collagen
and GAG have demonstrated
that the range of stiffness similar to our matrices, 0.5 kPa, was
optimal to direct MSCs toward chondrogenic lineage.22 However, the same compositions with higher stiffness, 1.5
kPa, upregulated the osteogenic expression. Both cases were tested
in the absence of differentiation supplements. Having our composites
a lower stiffness than the one described as osteogenic could be the
cause of the negative RUNX2 expression in our hydrogels. MSCs myogenic
induction also needs a certain mechanical stiffness (10 kPa in ref (38)) and usually requires
the addition of several specific growth factors when MSCs are encapsulated
in hydrogels.39 Although adipogenesis is
promoted in softer hydrogels, MSCs in them usually need to be in very
high densities, which could be the reason our hydrogels did not show
LPL expression.40,41

Although pure Gel hydrogels
have been proposed for cartilage tissue
engineering, the adhesion of the encapsulated cells is very strong
and tend to have a stretched morphology with secretion of markers that are
not typical of articular cartilage, such as collagen type I and hypertrophy
markers.35 From the mechanical point of
view, Gel stiffness is too low (172 Pa of storage shear modulus, Figure 2A) and is not able
to counterbalance the traction forces exerted by cells, resulting
in a dramatic shrinkage during the in vitro culture, as previously
shown in ref (25).
These shortcomings and the fast degradation rate of Gel make the mixtures
more attractive materials.

The chondrogenic potential of HA
is well-known20 and has predominated in
the hydrogel mixtures that also
promoted chondrogenesis. During cell mitosis and migration, a thin
pericellular layer rich in HA is secreted by cells, which mediates
their detachment from the ECM and promotes cell rounding.42 In cartilage, the chondrocyte CD44 receptor
interacts with secreted HA chains, keeping the cells surrounded by
a gel-like environment that is crucial for maintaining the differentiated
phenotype.43 However, pure HA hydrogel
has some limitations because of the low or even null cell proliferation
and the fact that secreted ECM tends to remain in the pericellular
space and not distributed within the hydrogel.35 Our results show that although in HA, a rounded cell morphology
with the expression of chondrogenic markers is obtained in the GM
(Figure 6) and CM (Figures S4.1 and S4.2) (probably due to the interaction
of hMSCs with the HA chains by the CD44 receptor), the number of cells
is very low and decreases with the time of culture (Figure 3).

The hybrid Gel−HA
matrices mimic the composition of the
ECM and combine the cell adhesive chains of Gel (containing RGD sequences)
with HA chains that are more rigid than Gel, provide stiffness, have
a lower degradation rate than Gel, and induce chondrogenesis. The
in vitro cultures in the GM show that the percentage of cells synthesizing
aggrecan, SOX-9, collagen type II, and GAGs increases with the percentage
of HA in the hydrogel. Although pure HA seems to promote the chondrogenic
phenotype, it is not the best matrix for cartilage tissue engineering
as cell adhesion to this material is very poor, and it also does not
promote cell proliferation. 50/50 or 30/70 Gel–HA mixtures
seem to be better candidates for the encapsulation of hMSCs as they
allow both cell adhesion and proliferation and still benefit from
the presence of HA, enhancing cell differentiation into the chondrogenic
phenotype. Our results are consistent with others reporting that the
incorporation of HA in hydrogels promotes chondrogenic differentiation.19,28 In particular, Levett et al.19 demonstrated
that dedifferentiated chondrocytes encapsulated in three-dimensional
Gel–HA hydrogels containing small amounts of HA were able to
redifferentiate to chondrocytes.

As Gel resulted in a higher
substitution degree of tyramine than
HA,25 Gel network is more cross-linked
than HA, which is consistent with its lower swelling capacity in comparison
to HA (Figure 2D and Table 2), being the mixtures
between the values of pure networks. The apparent cross-linking density
was calculated elsewhere25 and was higher
for Gel (1.95 mol/m3) than for HA (0.69 mol/m3), having the mixtures cross-linking densities within these values
(Table 2). The apparent
cross-linking density of the degraded hydrogels (20–30% mass
loss) decreased for Gel and Gel–HA mixtures, obtaining a decrease
from 1.95 to 0.68 mol/m3 for pure Gel hydrogel (Table 2), as usually occurs
in bulk homogeneous degradation of networks.27 Internal hydrogel degradation creates a chain cleavage in the peptide
bond (for Gel)6 and in the β-1-4
glycosidic linkages (for HA),27 causing
reduced hydrogel cross-linking that creates loosened networks of higher
mesh size with more hydroxyl groups or bigger pores capable of absorbing
more water. Also, because Gel degrades first (Figure 2C), it will leave gaps or small pores that
will increase enzyme diffusion and hydrogel degradation. On the other
hand, no change in EWC was obtained after 30% degradation in the HA
hydrogel (Figure 2D).
As previously reported,44 the difficulty
of hyaluronidase diffusion inside the pure HA hydrogel provokes surface
degradation causing hydrogel mass loss without changing the apparent
cross-linking density, which seems to increase from 0.69 to 1.02 mol/m3 after 20–30% degradation (see Table 2) but with no significant difference from
the nondegraded sample (Figure 2C).

The mechanical stiffness of hydrogels depends on
the cross-linking
degree, the water content, the chemical composition, the rigidity
of the chains, and the water permeability coefficient. Because HA
has a lower cross-linking degree, it would be expected that hydrogels
with a higher HA content would have a lower shear modulus. However,
this is not the case because hydrogels with a higher HA content have
a higher mechanical modulus and a higher swelling degree (Figure 2A,D). The rigidity
of HA chains in water and the lower hydraulic permeability of water
from HA would explain an increase in the storage modulus of the hydrogels
from 172 Pa for pure Gel to 789 Pa for pure HA (Figure 2A)21,25 as the ratio of HA
in the mixtures increases.

Overall, the 30/70 Gel–HA
mixture shows characteristics
that are most suitable for regenerative therapies in cartilage damage.
It is the composite that had the lowest degradation rate but still
presented bulk degradation demonstrated by the lower cross-linking
density after 20–30% degradation. This means that those spaces
left in the hydrogel mesh after degradation would allow spreading
of secreted ECM, which would not occur in pure HA where surface degradation
was inferred from the swelling results after degradation. This mixture
still benefits from integrin adhesion cues provided by Gel that promotes
cytoskeleton development and cell proliferation. In addition, the
high HA content allowed to increase the mechanical stiffness up to
690 Pa, very close to that of pure HA, confirming the stability of
the network provided by HA in the mixtures, and most importantly,
it has been the composite that shows the greatest benefit from the
chondrogenic HA biochemical cues in the absence of differentiation
supplements. 30/70 Gel–HA hydrogel is the only mixture that
showed a significant difference of collagen type II expression and
SOX-9 positive cell percentage compared to Gel in the GM. Furthermore,
aggrecan and GAGs positive cell percentage of the 30/70 composite
is the highest among the mixtures and equal to the percentages found
in pure HA. The null proliferative potential, poor cell cytoskeleton
development, and surface degradation profile could be sufficient arguments
to defend that the HA hydrogel needs the combination with small amounts
of cell adhesive protein to optimize its chondrogenic potential, whereas
pure Gel results in insufficient mechanical stiffness and enhanced
cell adhesion inhibiting MSC chondrogenesis in three-dimension in
the absence of specific growth factors.

4 Conclusions
Enzymatically cross-linked injectable Gel and HA hydrogel hybrids
show a high potential as systems for the regeneration of articular
cartilage as chondrogenic differentiation is promoted even in the
GM. Including HA in the mixtures provides better mechanical properties
than pure Gel and adds stability in terms of degradability. Moreover,
the presence of HA stimulates aggrecan, SOX-9, collagen type II, and
GAG synthesis. Gel is needed in the hybrids to improve cell adhesion
and for their retention/proliferation over an extended period as very
few cells are found in the pure HA hydrogels.

5.2 Gel and
HA Hydrogel Synthesis
Hydrogel
mixtures with different proportions of Gel and HA were obtained by
enzymatically cross-linking their tyramine conjugates in the same
way as described in ref (25).

For tyramine grafting onto Gel, 2% (w/v) Gel in
50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (>99%,
MES) was dissolved at 60 °C under stirring. Then tyramine hydrochloride
(98%, Tyr) was added (2:1 Tyr/COOH molar ratio) and stirred for 20
min at room temperature (RT). The pH was adjusted to 6 and N-hydroxysucciniamide (NHS) (98%) was added and stirred.
EDC was then added, and the mixture was stirred for 24 h at 37 °C.
The molar ratios were 2:1 for EDC/COOH and 1:10 for NHS/EDC. The solution
was then dialyzed [dialysis tubing 12 400 molecular weight
cutoff (MWCO)] against deionized water for 48 h. Finally, the modified
Gel was lyophilized in a LyoQuest freeze dryer (Telstar Life Science
Solutions, Japan).

Before tyramine bonding with HA, the molecular
weight of HA was
reduced from 1.06 MDa to ∼320 000 Da by acidic degradation.25 For the tyramine grafting, 0.5 w/v % of the
low-molecular-weight HA was dissolved in 150 mM NaCl, 276 mM MES,
and 75 mM NaOH at pH 5.75. Subsequently, tyramine hydrochloride was
added (2:1 Tyr/COOH molar ratio) and stirred until dissolution, and
the pH was adjusted at 5.75. Afterward, EDC (1:1 EDC/COOH molar ratio)
and NHS (1:10 NHS/EDC molar ratio) were added and stirred for 24 h
until the reaction was completed. Finally, dialysis (dialysis tubing
of 3500 MWCO) against 150 mM NaCl was performed for 24 h and against
deionized water another 24 h, with three changes of dialysis solution
each day. The modified HA was dried in the lyophilizer.

To prepare
the hydrogels, solutions of pure tyramine-modified Gel
and HA at 2 w/v % in CF-KRB were made at 37 °C. For proper HA
dissolution, the solution was prepared 1 day early and left to dissolve
at 4 °C for 24 h. Gel solution (2 w/v %) was fully dissolved
after 30 min at 37 °C. Different volumetric proportions of Gel–HA
were obtained (100/0, 70/30, 50/50, 30/70, and 0/100). The hydrogels
were formed with 80 v/v % of the 2 w/v % Gel–HA mixtures, 10
v/v % HRP at 12.5 U/mL (1.25 U/mL in the final volume), and 10 v/v
% H2O2 20 mM (2 mM in the final volume) after
few minutes of adding the peroxide.

5.3 Mechanical
Characterization of Hydrogels by
Rheology
Shear deformation rheological experiments were performed
on a strain-controlled AR-2000ex rheometer (TA Instruments). A solvent
trap geometry of parallel plates (made of nonporous stainless steel,
diameter = 20 mm) was used to reduce the solvent loss during the experiment.
The gap between the plates was around 1200 μm. The sample temperature
was controlled and maintained by a Peltier device at 37 °C. The
mixtures of Gel, HA, and the enzyme (HRP) were arranged on the plate
at 37 °C and cross-linked by adding the correct amount of H2O2. After 20 min, the samples had been cross-linked,
and two different measurements were performed. First, the range of
strain amplitudes at which the gels exhibit a linear region of viscoelasticity
was determined. A dynamic strain sweep (with amplitudes ranging between
0.01% and 15%) was carried out at a frequency of 1 Hz to measure the
dynamic shear modulus as a function of strain. Second, to determine
the dependence of the dynamic shear modulus and loss factor on the
frequency, a dynamic frequency sweep test was performed between 0.1
and 10 Hz at 1% strain, corresponding to the hydrogel linear region.

The following data were obtained from the rheological measurements:
storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), complex modulus magnitude [|G*|, a measure of the hydrogel stiffness: |G*|2 = (G′)2 + (G″)2], and loss factor [tan δ ≡ (G″)/(G′), a measure of the
internal energy dissipation, where δ is the phase angle between
the applied stimulus and the corresponding response] as a function
of the strain amplitude or frequency.

5.4 Enzymatic
Degradation Study
After
the hydrogel synthesis, the hydrogels were left overnight in DPBS
with 0.02 w/v % sodium azide to remove unreacted substances and reach
equilibrium swelling. The in vitro degradation of Gel–HA hydrogels
was subsequently performed by incubating the hydrogels with hyaluronidase
and collagenase at 37 °C. Cylindrical samples (7 mm diameter
and 280 μL volume) were incubated in 10 U/mL of hyaluronidase
(type IV-S from bovine testes, Sigma-Aldrich) and 3 U/mL of collagenase
(type IA from Clostridium histolyticum, Sigma-Aldrich) solutions in DPBS with 0.5 w/v % sodium azide at
37 °C. Five replicates were conducted for each composition and
time point.

Degradation was followed by mass loss of the hydrogel
as a function of time. The initial swollen mass (ms,t0) was noted and measured
at different time points (ms,t), which provided mass loss by eq 1 1  

The EWC of
the hydrogel swollen in DPBS with 0.02 w/v % sodium
azide overnight, which was used for comparison after formation after
reaching 20–30% degradation, was obtained by eq 2 2  where ms,d is
the swollen mass at 20–30% degradation and md,d is the dried mass at 20–30% degradation.

5.5 Cell Culture in Gel–HA Hydrogels
BM-hMSCs were expanded in the presence of a GM consisting of Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), a high glucose-based medium
with 0.4% penicillin/streptomycin solution (stock solution, 10 000
U/mL penicillin and 10 mg/mL streptomycin), 1 mM l-glutamine,
0.05% FUNGIZONE (stock solution at 250 μg/mL), 100 μM
sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C and
5% CO2 in an incubator.

Gel (2 w/v %) and HA (2 w/v
%) solutions were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized powder in
DMEM with 1% P/S, 24 h at 4 °C for HA and 30 min at 37 °C
for Gel. HRP solution (12.5 U/mL) was then added to the prepared solutions
at a volume ratio of 10/80 (mL of HRP/mL Gel or HA solution), and
the obtained mixture was filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe
filter for sterilization. Then, solutions in different proportions
(100/0, 70/30, 50/50, 30/70, and 0/100 v/v) of Gel + HRP and HA +
HRP were prepared.

BM-hMSCs were detached from the flask using
trypsin ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, neutralized with the GM, centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 5 min,
resuspended in the GM, and counted with a hemocytometer. The required
amount of BM-hMSCs (passage 6–7) cells (1 × 106 cells/mL) was added to each Gel–HA mixture. Finally, 45 μL
of the Gel–HA cell suspension was cross-linked with 5 μL
of 20 mM H2O2 on each well of the cell culture
plate and left in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min to ensure hydrogel cross-linking. Finally, triplicates
of each composition were cultured in the GM and CM, the latter composed
of GM without FBS and with 100 nM dexamethasone, 1% ITS-X, 50 μg/mL
ascorbic 2-phosphate, 40 μg/mL l-proline, and 10 ng/mL
TGF-β3.26 The hydrogels formed a
drop of about 7 mm diameter at the bottom of the cell culture wells
(nonadhesive wells were used to prevent cell interaction with them),
which means that the maximum thickness of the hydrogels was 3.5 mm.
Cell culture was followed for 14 days, and the cell medium was changed
every 2 days.

5.6 Cell Proliferation Assay
(MTS)
Cell
proliferation was studied by analyzing the cell viability on days
2, 7, and 14 of culture using the MTS assay, following manufacturer
instructions. Briefly, the cell-cultured samples (four replicates)
were moved to a new cell culture plate and incubated with a fresh
culture medium without phenol red or FBS but containing the MTS reagent
(ratio 5:1) at 37 °C for 2 h in the dark. Thereafter, the absorbance
of 100 μL of supernatant transferred to a new cell culture plate
was measured at 490 and 690 nm with an Infinite 200 PRO plate reader
(Tecan, Switzerland). Absorbance at 490 nm is proportional to the
number of viable cells in each sample, whereas the absorbance at 690
nm is used to subtract the potential background signal of small pieces
of hydrogels inside each well.

5.7 Immunofluorescence
Study
After 14
days of culture, the samples were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde
for 15 min, and washed again with PBS to remove the formaldehyde solution.
After the fixing step, the samples were soaked overnight in 30 w/v
% sucrose in DPBS, embedded in OCT, and frozen with liquid nitrogen.
Finally, 40 μm sections were cut out with a Leica CM 1860 UV
cryostat.

Gel–HA gel sections cultured in the GM and
CM were immunostained for aggrecan and SOX-9, two characteristic components
of articular cartilage. First, the sections on the slides were washed
and rehydrated with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS
for 20 min at RT and given two 5 min washes with PBS. The blocking
buffer, formed by 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution in PBS, was
then added for 1 h at RT, and two washes with PBS were performed.
Primary antibodies were diluted 1:100 in the blocking buffer, and
two sets of samples were separately incubated with aggrecan and SOX-9
antibody solutions for 1 h at RT. Then, the samples were washed and
incubated with donkey anti-rabbit rhodamine secondary antibody solution
for aggrecan staining and with the donkey antimouse AF 488 secondary
antibody for SOX-9 for 1 h at RT, both secondaries diluted 1:200 in
the blocking buffer. Finally, two washes with PBS for 10 min were
carried out; actin was stained with BODIPY FL phallacidin (aggrecan)
or with rhodamine phalloidin (SOX-9) for 30 min at RT (both diluted
1:100 in PBS). The samples were washed, and the slides were mounted
with VECTASHIELD with DAPI.

For Gel–HA samples cultured
in the GM, other antibodies,
characteristic of other cell lineages, were tested to determine whether
the BM-hMSCs in these types of gels tend to differentiate into one
or the other cell lineage. For this, the hydrogel sections were washed
and rehydrated with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS
at RT, rinsed with PBS twice for 5 minutes, blocked in 1% BSA/0.1%
Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at RT, and rinsed with PBS. The following
primary antibodies were then incubated in the blocking buffer for
1 h at RT: rabbit polyclonal RUNX2, rabbit polyclonal LPL, and mouse
monoclonal MF-20. Two 5 min washes were performed, and the secondary
antibody Cy3 antimouse or antirabbit was incubated, according to the
primary antibody used, at 1:200 in the blocking buffer for 1 h at
RT. After two washes with PBS, actin was stained with BODIPY phallacidin
1:100 in PBS and washed twice for 10 min, and the stained sections
were mounted in VECTASHIELD with DAPI.

5.8 Alcian
Blue Histochemistry
Gel–HA
hydrogels without cells, as controls, and samples cultured for 14
days in the GM or CM were stained with alcian blue to localize GAGs
within the hydrogels. The hydrogel section slides were rehydrated
by washing with PBS twice for 5 min and then incubated in 1% alcian
blue in 0.1 N HCl at pH 1 for 30 min to stain sulfated GAGs, rinsed
with tap water and distilled water, and counterstained with 0.1% nuclear
fast red for 5 min. The slides with the sections were then rinsed
in tap water, rinsed with distilled water, and dehydrated with increasing
ethanol solutions (70 and 90%) and xylene for 1 min each wash. Finally,
the sections were mounted with the DPX mounting medium. GAGs positive
staining was documented by optical microscopy using bright-field illumination.

5.9 Gene Expression for Collagen Type II
RNA
was extracted from the gels after 14 days of incubation using
an RNeasy Micro kit; briefly, samples were washed with PBS, then lysed/homogenized,
mixed with 70% ethanol, and loaded onto a microcolumn and spun; then
the columns were washed, DNase treated, washed again, and finally
eluted in sterile water. After RNA concentration measurement and RNA
quality check on NanoDrop, cDNA was synthetized; preamplification
step was performed using a ProFlex thermocycler (Applied Biosciences),
and finally, qPCR was run on a CFX-96 thermocycler (Bio-Rad) using
GAPDH as the housekeeping gene. The primer sequences were as follows:
COL2A1-forward 5′-GGC AAT AGC AGG TTC ACG TAC A-3′;
COL2A1-revers 5′-CGA TAA CAG TCT TGC CCC ACT T-3′; GAPDH-forward
5′-AGG TCG GTG TGA ACG GAT TTG-3′; GAPDH-revers 5′-TGT
AGA CCA TGT AGT TGA GGT CA-3′. Results were analyzed with CFX
Manager software.

5.10 Statistical Analysis
For the statistical
studies, either Statgraphics or GraphPad Prism5 software was used.
Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test, one-way ANOVA with Tukey
post-test, Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test with Dunn’s
post-test, or unpaired two-tailed t-test was performed
where applicable.
