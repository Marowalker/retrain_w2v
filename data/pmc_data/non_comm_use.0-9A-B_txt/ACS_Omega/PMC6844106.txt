A serine protease inhibitor was extracted
from potato tubers. The
inhibitor was conjugated to soluble, prefractionated dextran and titanium
dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles. Conjugation to dextran was achieved
by periodate oxidation of the dextran, followed by Schiff base coupling
to inhibitor amino groups, and finally reduction, whereas the conjugation
to the oxide particles was carried out by aminosilanization and carbonyldiimidazole
activation. The inhibitory effect of the conjugated inhibitor was
compared to that of free inhibitor in solution and with gelatin gel
as a direct substrate. A certain degree of inhibitory activity was
retained for both the dextran-conjugated and particle-conjugated inhibitors.
In particular, the apparent Ki value of
the dextran-conjugated inhibitor was found to be in the same range
as that for free inhibitor. The dextran conjugate retained a higher
activity than the free inhibitor after 1 month of storage at room
temperature.

Introduction
Endogenous proteases,
such as the serine proteases trypsin and
chymotrypsin, are essential for the digestion in the host. However,
these enzymes can also cause medical problems such as skin inflammation
or acute pancreatitis.1,2 As a general protection, several
endogenous protease inhibitors are also expressed, such as the pancreas
trypsin inhibitor and α-1-antitrypsin. Protease inhibitors are
also present in seeds and tubers in various plant families, including Solanaceae, potato family. As an example, protease inhibitors
extracted from Solanum tuberosum, common
potato, have inhibiting effects on digestive enzymes such as trypsin,
chymotrypsin, and elastase.3−6 Inhibitory effects on cell growth have also been
observed.7,8 Protease inhibitors have already been successfully
tested clinically both in vitro and in vivo.9

The wide range of serine protease inhibitors that are expressed
in potato (S. tuberosum) and mentioned
above serve as a crucial defense mechanism against protein digestion
by self, fungal, and bacterial proteases.10,11 Among these inhibitors, a Kunitz-type inhibitor (potato serine protease
inhibitor, PSPI) is the most abundant11 and accounts for about 20% of the soluble proteins.12 The configuration of the reactive loop for PSPI is not
fully known, but some authors suggest that it represents a two-headed
reactive group type; it has also been shown that PSPI can not only
bind two different proteases at the same time, i.e., trypsin and chymotrypsin,
but also two trypsins due to its two independent binding loops.10,13,14 The inhibition effect of potato
serine protease inhibitor on endogenous proteases has been proven
as a remedy against severe dermatitis caused under certain conditions.15

A conjugation to selected carriers can
increase the convenience
of use in different applications,16−18 e.g., by inclusion in
skin protection formulas. Furthermore, conjugation can often have
favorable effects on the resistance to high temperatures and harsh
chemical environments and may improve the stability of the protein.
This study describes the conjugation of PSPI to dextran and to solid
carriers, i.e., zinc oxide and titanium dioxide particles, all of
which are used in medical and hygiene applications. To the best of
our knowledge, no immobilization protocol for PSPI has been reported
so far. Dextran is biocompatible19 and
has previously been documented as an excellent carrier for different
proteins and is here chosen for this purpose.20,21,24,25 Among the
different conjugation methods between dextran and proteins,24−31 the periodate oxidation method is effective, feasible, and thus
well-established.20 Furthermore, it does
not lead to a direct dextran–dextran cross-linking. In this
study, prefractionated water-soluble dextran with 150–190 kDa
molar mass was used to conjugate PSPI by the periodate oxidation method,
and the result of the conjugation was analyzed by a combination of
light-scattering, chromatography, and concentration measurements.21 The conjugation to the oxide particles was carried
out by aminosilanization followed by carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) activation.22,23

Our aims in the present work were to (1) establish conjugation
protocols for the protease inhibitor from S. tuberosum onto soluble and particle carriers and (2) characterize the stability
and kinetics parameters of the conjugated PSPI.

Results and Discussion
Dextran
Size Refractionation, Quantification, and Light-Scattering
Analysis
The dextran concentration and mass distribution
in the eluates of size exclusion chromatography are shown in Figure 1a, and the dextran
concentration in the major fractions was between 6 and 12.8 mg/mL.
The sensitivity limit of the sugar measurement by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic
acid (DNS) method is 0.3 mg/mL dextran based on a standard curve.
The light-scattering analysis of unfractionated dextran T70 (Figure 1b) displays a major
mass spread from 151 to 60 kDa. The fractionation by size exclusion
chromatography resulted, as expected, in a narrower size range. Oxidized
dextran displayed a generally later elution peak compared to the intact
dextran (Figure 1c).

The analyzed peak of
each sample is divided into front, peak, and
back to highlight the distribution of the molecular weight of each
sample in the peak. The value of each sample peak as a whole is also
included. The oxidation of dextran resulted in a decrease in molecular
weight from 68 to 17 kDa, indicating that a degradation has taken
place (Table 1), assuming
the same value for the specific refractive index increment dn/dc. An example of one conjugate (alt
1) is also shown in Table 1 to illustrate the larger molecular weight of the conjugate.
The theoretical mass averages for the total sample contents were calculated
using the well-known expressions below (eq 1). 1

Conjugation
of Oxidized Dextran and PSPI
The conjugation
was carried out using five different alternatives following the same
general principle. The alternatives differed in the ratio between
oxidized dextran and PSPI, time of incubation, amount of reducing
agent, and whether the alternatives were neutralized with HCl. All
data regarding the conjugation can be found in Table 2. In the analysis of the conjugation according
to alternative 1, the size-exclusion chromatography showed two elution
peaks (Figure 3a),
one for conjugate and one for nonconjugated inhibitor, probably due
to the considerably high PSPI/oxidized dextran molecule ratio (6.95)
and the initial presence of 0.1 M NaBH3CN. The sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis showed
that this conjugate stayed close to the top of the separation gel,
confirming a very large size (Figure 3a, lane 2) compared to that of the free PSPI (Figure 3a, lane 3). Light-scattering
analysis (Figure 3b
and Table 1) revealed
an average molecular weight of the same conjugate of approximately
400 kDa. It is obvious, both from scattering data and chromatogram
itself, that the conjugation resulted in a considerable increase in
molecule size and mass. This prominent increase in molecule size and
mass can not be explained by the formation of isolated complexes between
proteins and single dextran molecules but may reveal a degree of protein-mediated
cross-linking. As can be seen in Figures 2,5, and 6, there are 10 lysine residues (marked in magenta in the structure)
available for conjugation but thus also for cross-linking. The formation
of the bond between oxidized dextran and PSPI is shown in detail in
Figure 2.

In the
conjugation alternative 2, the molar ratio between PSPI
and oxidized dextran was 1.67. The size-exclusion chromatography showed
that only one peak, eluting generally somewhat later than the first
peak observed from alternative 1, but no separated free PSPI peak
was observed in the elution volume range expected for that (Figure 4). The SDS-PAGE analysis
further confirmed this, since the peak pools of the alternative 2
conjugate showed again a major material spread from close to the top
of the separation gel with a smear further into the gel, but all of
it migrating slower than the free PSPI (Figure 4, lanes 1–4). These results indicated
that all PSPI molecules were conjugated to the oxidized dextran. In
conclusion, the procedure in alternative 2 resulted in complete conjugation,
possibly due to the long overnight incubation. The conjugation alternatives
3–5 did also result in complete conjugation and a similar inhibitory
efficiency (Table 2). However, the data reveal, as expected, a certain degree of protein-mediated
cross-linking of the dextran carriers.

Inhibition Activity Analysis
of Free and Dextran-Conjugated
PSPI
The double-reciprocal plots were analyzed by linear
regression using GraphPad Prism 8. Ki was
calculated according to eqs 1–3, and the values are listed
in Table 2. Generally,
the apparent Ki of the dextran-conjugated
inhibitor molecules is approximately twice as high as that for the
free inhibitor.

The apparent Ki values
of the conjugates are obviously affected of which lysine(s) that serve
in the conjugation and how close the conjugation is to the active
site(s). It was earlier proposed13,32 that this
double-headed inhibitor could simultaneously bind two of the same
or different proteases at the same time. The binding of two trypsins
simultaneously to PSPI is definitely confirmed, whereas only one α-chymotrypsin
was bound.14 The active site(s) of PSPI
have not been unequivocally identified due to the lack of complex
structural data, but there are a number of theoretically proposed
active sites (Figure 5) that are most commonly found in the protruding
loops.

Figure 5 Sequence of PSPI where suggested active sites are marked in pink
(I: Asn45-Asp50, II: Ser71-Phe80, III: around Lys95) and the ten possible
conjugation sites are marked in magenta. Note that the proposed active
site Lys95 is also a possible conjugation site.

For monomeric Kunitz type serine protease inhibitor, it is most
common that the section Ser71-Phe80 serves as an active site loop,
with Phe75 being the P1 residue, so there is one proposed active site
in PSPI located around Phe75 and, for the same reason, one around
Lys95. It can be seen in Figures 5 and 6 that most of the possible conjugation sites most likely do not affect
the inhibition of the protease(s). Since Lys95 also is a possible
site for conjugation, the possible outcome that a number of the inhibitor
molecules are conjugated by means of this residue will obviously affect
the Ki value since that site is no longer
available on all molecules.

Figure 6 Model of PSPI where two of the possible reactive
sites (Phe75 and
Lys95) of this double-headed inhibitor are marked in pink. The possible
conjugation sites (lysine) are marked in magenta. The model is also
shown after a 180° flip to better demonstrate possible conjugations
sites. PDB ID: 3TC2.

The apparent Ki values are listed below
in Table 2, and the
apparent Ki values observed after 1 month
of storage at different temperatures can be seen in Table 3. The apparent Ki values for dextran–PSPI conjugates lie within
the same range (μM) and, compared to that of the free inhibitor,
the Ki values increased by a factor of
1.7–2.6, which as mentioned above could be due to cross-linking
and sterical hindrance. To evaluate the conjugates, we have chosen
to use the parameter efficiency as defined below. The efficiency is
easily regarded as the fraction of inhibitor molecules that are functionally
active, and the loss of efficiency can be ascribed to denaturation
and/or sterical inaccessibility. The efficiency is thus calculated
from the apparent Ki value observed, . After
the conjugation of PSPI to dextran,
the inhibitor still remains 39–58% active in the different
conjugation alternatives and remains 12–20% active after 1
month of storage. The SDS-PAGE analysis (supplement) of the stored
conjugates shows that they still remain intact and there are no traces
of released PSPI, irrespective of the temperature of storage. A control
experiment of free PSPI stored at RT for 1 month gave an apparent Ki value of 0.902 μM (Supporting Information Figure S6), which shows an efficiency of 0.11
relative the freshly made free inhibitor with an apparent Ki of 0.102 μM (Table 2). This shows that the conjugated PSPI are
roughly twice as stable at room temperature than the free inhibitor.

Inhibition
Activity Analysis of PSPI Conjugated to Activated
Particles
The amount PSPI conjugated to activated particles
was calculated to be 2.86 nmol/mg for TiO2 and 1.70 nmol/mg
for ZnO. During the conjugation, the conjugate of the particles and
PSPI was exposed to 65 °C for 5 h during the buffer removal stage,
and the conjugate still remains active with an apparent Ki value of 1.8 μM for the TiO2–PSPI
conjugate and 4.8 μM for the ZnO-PSPI conjugate (Table 4). A control experiment where
the free PSPI was exposed to the same environment for the same time
gave an apparent Ki value of 17 μM,
which clearly indicates that the conjugates are more resistant to
heat treatment. The efficiency (Table 4) of the conjugated inhibitor was thus calculated to
be 0.02 for ZnO-PSPI and 0.06 for TiO2-PSPI, which, however,
is better than that observed for free inhibitor subjected to the same
heat treatment.

Inhibition
Activity Analysis by the Gelatin Erosion Method
The gelatin
erosion method was chosen as an additional method to
evaluate the function of the conjugate since it mimics a process on
a surface that needs a protective cover layer. The free PSPI and −20
°C stored dextran–PSPI conjugate showed inhibition of
both trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion actions on gelatin in a 24-well
plate. The ratio (vi/v0) between the area increase rate in the presence of inhibitor
(vi) and the area increase rate for the
undisturbed enzyme (v0) was studied as
a function of free PSPI and dextran-conjugated PSPI. The ratio v0/vi (Figures 7 and 8) was a linear function of inhibitor concentration, which is in accordance
with competitive inhibition. The linear regression values extracted
from the v0/vi graphs revealed that the gelatin erosion method displays a very
similar behavior of the free and dextran-conjugated PSPI, which can
be seen in Table 5.
The results from the gelatin erosion method show that there is no
large difference between the conjugate and free PSPI. This indicates
that the conjugation itself of PSPI does not affect the mode of action
and that the conjugated inhibitor still can function similarly to
the free PSPI in this type of experiment. The mechanism itself (competitive
inhibition) is retained, since the v0/vi of the conjugate remains as a linear function
of inhibitor concentration.

Conclusions
The
SDS-PAGE analysis of the conjugates showed no traces of a band
corresponding to the free inhibitor, proving that the inhibitory effects
observed really depended on the conjugated inhibitor. The apparent Ki was influenced by the conjugation, most likely
by the sterical hindrance, but increased at most by a factor of 2.6
for the fresh dextran conjugate. Conclusively, half of the inhibitor
molecules are, on the average, still accessible. There are 10 lysine
residues, i.e., possible conjugation sites, on PSPI where one lysine
also is postulated as a possible active site. The Ki value is affected by this random linkage between PSPI
and activated dextran. Overall, the conjugation of PSPI leads to an
increase in the apparent Ki value but
still in an acceptable range. The conjugates showed an improved storage
stability compared to the free inhibitor. Similarly, it was found
that the conjugation of the inhibitor to the particles makes it more
resistant to harsh heat treatment. The different conjugates will thus
improve the applicability of the inhibitor both for medical/care purposes
and use in biotechnology processes. The change in apparent Ki does, most certainly, reflect the limited
availability of individual inhibitor molecules rather than a gradual
change of the intrinsic properties of the molecules regarding both
kinetics and binding equilibrium.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Potatoes and commercial household gelatin
powder (type A, from porcine source, Bloom number 220–240 g),
of the brand Törsleff’s “favorit gelatin pulver—extra
guld”, were purchased from the local food shop. 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic
acid (DNS), K-Na tartrate, Dextran T70, sodium periodate (NaIO4), sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN), sodium borohydride
(NaBH4), polyacrylamide, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250,
Nα-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride
(BAPA), titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, aminopropyltriethoxysilane,
carbonyldiimidazole, trypsin, and chymotrypsin were all purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Protein molecular weight standard kit (260–3.5
kD) was purchased from Norvex. All other chemicals were of analytical
grade.

Preparation of PSPI
The crude extraction and chromatographic
separation were principally carried out according to the study by
Pouvreau and Valueva.11,33 Potatoes were mixed with MQ water,
followed by the precipitation of ammonium sulfate. After heat-shocking
of the resuspension at 56 °C for 15 min, the supernatant was
reprecipitated by ammonium sulfate, and the resuspension was applied
to desalting, cation exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography.
The major fractions with high inhibition activity of PSPI in 0.1 M
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, were collected and stored
at −20 °C after the absorbance measurement at 280 nm.
A value of 27305 M–1 cm–1 for
the molar extinction coefficients was used for the calculation of
protein concentration.

Preparation of Dextran
Dextran Quantitation by
the DNS Method
DNS reagent
was prepared from 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS), K-Na tartrate,
and NaOH.34 Dextran T70 water solutions
with concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 30 mg/mL were used as standards
and MQ water as a control. Dextran samples (0.1 mL) were prehydrolyzed
by boiling for 1 h with 1 mL of 1 M HCl and neutralized with 1 mL
of 1 M NaOH after cooling. Then, 0.5 mL of the sample was mixed with
0.5 mL of DNS reagent. After boiling for 5 min and cooling, 4.5 mL
of deionized water was added to the mixture and the absorbance at
540 nm was measured.

Dextran Prefractionation
A volume
of 38 mL dextran
T70 with concentrations of 30 mg/mL in MQ water was fractionated by
size-exclusion chromatography on a sephacryl S-300 (2.6 × 60
cm2, GE Health Care, Uppsala, Sweden) column at a flow
rate of 0.2 mL/min (Figure 1a). The dextran concentration in the fractions was determined
by the DNS method.34 Two consecutive 7
mL fractions in the dextran peak were pooled and stored at −20
°C.

Dextran Mass Determination
Light-scattering
analysis
was performed by injecting 200 μL of dextran or dextran derivatives
solutions via a 200 μL of loop into a Superdex 200 column (10
× 300 mM) connected sequentially with an interferometric refractometer
(Wyatt technology, Optilab DSP), enhanced optical system (DAWN EOS,
Wyatt technology), and UV flow spectrometer to determine the molar
mass. A srii (dn/dc) of 0.144 mL/g
was used for the molar mass calculation. dn/dc is an easily measured change in n with
a change in c (weight concentration, g/mL).

Conjugation of PSPI to Dextran
The prefractionated
dextran pool was incubated with 50 mM NaIO4 for 1 h at
room temperature, and the oxidized dextran was separated from the
salts by gel chromatography on PD-10 columns using MQ water as an
eluent. PSPI was then mixed with the oxidized dextran and incubated
at selected times with or without the simultaneous presence of sodium
cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN) (Table 2).

Alternative 1: 10 mL of oxidized
dextran (5.3 mg/mL) from the 190 kD pool was mixed with 10 mL of potato
protease inhibitor at 194 μM. The reaction was carried out in
the presence of 0.1 M NaBH3CN at room temperature for 2
h and terminated by the addition of one-fifth volume of 1 M Tris–HCl,
pH 9.0.

Alternative 2: 10 mL of oxidized dextran (8.7 mg/mL)
from the 150
kD pool was mixed with 5 mL of PSPI at 194 μM. The mixture was
kept at room temperature overnight (20 h). NaBH3CN was
then added at a final concentration of 1 mM and the mixture was kept
at room temperature for further 2 h. The reaction was stopped by the
addition of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) at the final concentration
of 0.1 M for 30 min, followed by neutralization to pH 7.0 by the addition
of 1 M HCl. The resulting solution was filtered through a 0.2 μm
membrane and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl
S-300 at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The peak fractions were collected
in five pools (pool 1: 164–179 mL, pool 2: 180–203 mL,
pool 3: 204–243 mL, pool 4: 244–283 mL, pool 5: 284–307
mL). The absorbance at 280 nm of the fractions was measured, and those
in the first peak, corresponding to the dextran-conjugated PSPI, were
collected. The pools were stored at −20 °C.

Alternatives
3–5: PSPI at 194 μM was mixed with 8.7
mg/mL oxidized dextran at 150 kD with the volume ratios of 0.5:1,
0.25:1, and 0.1:1, respectively. The mixtures were incubated at room
temperature for 23 h, followed by the addition of NaBH4 and HCl as above. No NaBH3CN was used.

SDS-PAGE
Analysis
PSPI and dextran conjugates were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 13% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained
with 0.5 mg/mL Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in a solvent of 10%
(v/v) acetic acid, 40% (v/v) methanol, and 50% (v/v) MQ water and
destained using the same solvent. Molecular standard (260–3.5
kD) from Norvex was used.

Conjugation of PSPI to
Inorganic Particles
Derivatization of Particles
All
derivatization and
immobilization steps were performed at room temperature in plastic
falcon tubes. The inorganic particle carriers (TiO2 and
ZnO) (0.5 grams) were first silanized using 100 mM APTES in 10 mL
of ACN while stirring for 24 h. The silanized particles were then
centrifuged, followed by the removal of ACN, washing three times with
EtOH, one final time with acetone, and then drying at 65 °C overnight.
The particles were activated using 120 mg of CDI and 0.72 mmol triethylamine
in 5 mL of ACN while stirring for 3 h. Then, the particles were centrifuged
to remove ACN, washed three times with EtOH, one final time with acetone,
and then dried at 65 °C overnight.

Immobilization of PSPI
Immobilization of PSPI was carried
out according to Table 6. The particles were collected by centrifugation, and the absorbance
was measured at 280 nm for the supernatants. The remaining nonconjugated
protein was determined. The immobilization was terminated by washing
the particles with 0.1 M NH4HCO3 pH 7.52 followed
by drying at 65 °C for 5 h and storage at 4 °C until further
use.

Kinetics
Inhibition Activity Analysis
of Free and Dextran-Conjugated
PSPI
Kinetic parameters were obtained by measuring the initial
velocities in the presence of varying concentrations of BAPA (0–3
mM) mixed with free (0.18–0.34 μM) or dextran-conjugated
PSPI (0.18–0.34 μM). All reactions were performed in
0.1 M NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 7.52, and 0–5%
(v/v) DMSO. The reaction was monitored at 410 nm in a UV-1601 UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The apparent Ki was extracted after fitting the data to linear regression
in GraphPad Prism 8 according to the Lineweaver−Burk equation
(eq 2) and its extended
version (eq 3).

End
Point Measurements for Inorganic Particle Conjugates
Kinetic
parameters were obtained by incubating substrate, enzyme,
and conjugate in a plastic Eppendorf tube with an end-over-end rotation.
The concentrations of TiO2-PSPI varied between 2.65 and
5.71 μM, ZnO-PSPI between 1.70 and 3.40 μM, and BAPA between
0 and 2 mM. All reactions were performed in 0.1 M NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 7.52, and 0–5% (v/v) DMSO. One hundred
fifty microliters of aliquots were withdrawn at 5 time points from
each sample, and the reaction was stopped in 100 mM acetic acid, pH
2.8. Absorbance was measured at 410 nm in a UV-1601 UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The apparent kinetic parameter Ki was extracted after fitting the data to linear
regression in GraphPad Prism 8. 2  And its extended version 3  where Km,app = Km × (1 + [I]/Ki)

For
alternatives 3–5, Ki was calculated
according to the following equation 4  

Inhibition Activity Analysis by the Gelatin Erosion Method
The method was principally described earlier.35 Gelatin powder (type A, from porcine source, Bloom number
220–240 g) with a concentration of 0.04 g/mL was dissolved
in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4, at 38 °C. After cooling to 30 °C,
it was mixed with free or conjugated PSPI, 0.1 M PBS, and MQ water
to get a gelatin concentration of 0.02 g/mL and a series of PSPI concentration.
A volume of 1 mL of mixture was added to a 24-well plate in quadruplicates
for each PSPI concentration. After solidification at 4 °C for
1 h, a volume of 20 μL of 15 μM trypsin or 20 μL
of 15 μM chymotrypsin in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4, was pipetted on
the center of the gelatin layer and the plates were covered with lids
and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. The diameter of the erosion in
the well was measured and the specific enlargement of the erosion
area was calculated by subtracting the area that was observed when
20 μL of water was added instead of the enzyme solution.

The relative area growth rate (vi/v0) was analyzed as a function of the inhibitor
concentration by GraphPad Prism 8 using the one-phase decay algorithm
(eq 5). 5  where K is the rate constant.
