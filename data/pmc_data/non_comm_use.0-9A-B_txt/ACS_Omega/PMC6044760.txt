The
emergence of drug-resistant bacterial pathogens highlights an urgent need for new
therapeutic options. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a potential
alternative to antibiotics to kill bacteria, which has been used in
clinical settings. PDT employs photosensitizers (PSs), light, and
oxygen to kill bacteria by generating highly reactive oxygen species
(ROS). PDT can target both
external and internal structures of bacteria, which does not really
require the PSs to enter bacteria. Therefore, bacteria can hardly
develop resistance to PDT. However, most of the PSs reported so far
are hydrophobic and tend to form aggregates when they interact with
bacteria. The aggregation could cause fluorescence quenching and reduce
ROS generation, which generally compromises the effects of both imaging
and therapy. In this contribution, we report on a Zn(II)-tetradentate-coordinated
red-emissive probe with aggregation-induced emission characterization.
The probe could selectively image bacteria over mammalian cells. Moreover,
the probe shows potent phototoxicity to both Gram-negative bacteria
(Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive
bacteria (Bacillus subtilis).

Introduction
The emergence of drug-resistant
bacterial pathogens highlights
an urgent need for new therapeutic options.1 The dominant resistance mechanisms include alteration of antibiotic
targets, active efflux of antibiotics from the cell, and antibiotic
modification catalyzed by enzymes.2 Many
pathogens simultaneously harbor several mechanisms to achieve antibiotic
resistance. One comprehensive approach to overcome resistance is to
develop antibiotic adjuvants that contain both antibiotics and other
bioactive molecules.3 These adjuvants change
the physiology of antibiotic-insensitive cells, incur a synergetic
effect, and finally improve the treatment efficiency and inhibit resistance.
The alternative choice is through photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT
has emerged as a good and potential alternative to antibiotics to
kill bacteria that has been used in clinical settings.4 PDT employs photosensitizers (PSs), light, and oxygen to
kill bacteria by generating highly reactive oxygen species (ROS).5 PDT can target both external
and internal structures of bacteria, which does not really require
the PSs to enter bacteria.6 Therefore,
bacteria can hardly develop resistance to PDT.5a,7 In addition,
many PSs could aid in image-guided antibacterial studies, as they
also have intrinsic fluorescence. However, most of the PSs reported
so far are hydrophobic and tend to form aggregates when they interact
with bacteria. The aggregation could cause fluorescence quenching
and reduce ROS generation,8 which generally
compromises the effects of both imaging and therapy.

Fluorogens
with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics
have recently attracted great attention in biological sensing, imaging,
and therapeutic applications.9 AIE fluorogens
(AIEgens) generally show very weak fluorescence as free molecules
but can become highly emissive in the aggregated state.10 Moreover, strong ROS generation has been observed
for some AIEgens, which are effective for cancer-cell ablation under
light irradiation.11 So far, several positively
charged AIEgens have been reported to image and kill bacteria on the
basis of electrostatic interactions.12 To
endow the probes with a positive charge, ammonium salts13a and the zinc(II)-dipicolylamine (ZnDPA) coordination
complex13b,13c are often employed, among which ZnDPA is
the most popular as it has a stronger binding affinity with bacteria
due to its higher positive charge.13b,13c In our previous
work, we developed a zinc(II)-coordinated PS (AIE-ZnDPA) with AIE
and excited-state intramolecular proton transfer characteristics to
selectively image and kill bacteria over mammalian cells.14 Although successful, the probe has several limitations.
First, the used AIEgen absorbs mainly in the UV region, which makes
it difficult for the probe to produce ROS when white light is used
as the light source. Moreover, fluorogens with short-wavelength absorption
and emission possess severe interference from sample autofluorescence.15 Second, AIE-ZnDPA used DPA to coordinate zinc(II),
which served as an anchor to the negatively charged bacterial membrane.
However, the binding between DPA and zinc(II) is weak, with a Kd of around 5 μM (Figure 1).16 As Kd is the ratio between ([free ligand] ×
[ion]) and [the ligand–ion binding complex], a higher Kd indicates that more free ligands exist in
solution (eq 1 in Supporting Information). As the ligand–ion complex is the recognition element in
the probe, a larger amount of probes are needed to bind with bacteria.
This can also lead to a higher background signal, as more unbound
free probes exist in the detection system. To design a better zinc(II)-binding
ligand, we reviewed the literature and found that (1) electron-withdrawing
groups can decrease the electron density on the ligand, which significantly
reduces its binding affinity (L1 vs L2; Figure 1)17 and that (2)
additional binding positions could significantly increase the binding
affinity (L2 vs L3; Figure 1).18 We are specifically interested
in L3 because it could be readily synthesized by Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne
cycloaddition (CuAAC) and shows a very low Kd value, in the nanomolar range.18a Taking all of the above considerations
into account, in this work, we employ CuAAC to decorate a red-emissive
AIE PS (TPETH) to develop a new probe for bacterial detection and
killing. The probe is almost nonemissive in aqueous solution, but
it becomes highly emissive after binding to the membrane of bacteria.
In addition, the probe can efficiently generate ROS to kill bacteria.

constants.

Results and Discussion
The synthetic
route to the probes is shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, alkylation of bis-2-picolylamine
with propargyl bromide generated 1. A CuAAC-mediated
click reaction between 1 and 2 yielded intermediates 3, with one binding motif, and 4, with two binding
motifs. Intermediates 3 and 4 were treated
with zinc perchlorate to yield the probes TPETH-1Zn and TPETH-2Zn. All compounds were characterized by NMR and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) to confirm their high purities and right
structures (Figures S1–S15).

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route to the Probes
With the probes and their intermediates at hand, we first
measured
their photophysical properties. Compounds 3, 4, TPETH-1Zn, and TPETH-2Zn have similar
absorption spectra in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Figure 2A). However, their fluorescent
properties are very different. As shown in Figure 2B, 3 and 4 are
highly emissive in the mixture of water and DMSO (v/v = 100/1), whereas TPETH-1Zn has moderate emission and TPETH-2Zn is only weakly emissive under the same conditions. This indicates
that the binding between 3 or 4 and zinc(II)
increases the probe solubility in aqueous media, leading to decreased
background signals. The increased aqueous solubility after zinc(II)
binding was further confirmed by dynamic light scattering experiments.
Both 3 and 4 have a mean
hydrodynamic diameter of around 300 nm, whereas TPETH-1Zn exhibits a mean size of around 30 nm after zinc(II) binding, but
no hydrodynamic size can be detected for TPETH-2Zn (Figure S16), clearly indicating that zinc(II)
binding could largely improve the aqueous solubility of the probe.
Following this fluorescence change after binding with zinc(II), we
measured the dissociation constant (Kd) of TPETH-1Zn by fitting the fluorescence titration
data with a 1:1 association equation (Figure S17A). The Kd is calculated to be 16.7 nM
for TPETH-1Zn (Figure S17B), which indicates that the ligands in TPETH-2Zn can
bind to Zn(II) tightly.

absorption spectra

of ethyl ether. (D) Hydrodynamic diameter measured with laser light
scattering for TPETH-2Zn (10 μM) in a mixture of
acetonitrile/ether (v/v = 1/100).

Although TPETH-2Zn is almost nonemissive in
aqueous
media, its fluorescence is intensified in the mixture of acetonitrile
and ethyl ether when the ratio of ether increases (Figure 2C). When the ether-to-acetonitrile
ratio is above 90%, TPETH-2Zn becomes insoluble and emits
bright red fluorescence and forms aggregates with an average diameter
of 307 nm (Figure 2D). These results indicate that TPETH-2Zn is an AIEgen,
which could turn on its fluorescence upon aggregate formation, such
as upon binding to a bacterial surface.

After confirming that TPETH-2Zn was not emissive in
aqueous medium but was able to fluoresce
upon aggregate formation, we evaluated its performance in real-time
imaging of bacteria. Without any washing steps, the probe emits strong
red emission upon interaction with bacteria (Escherichia
coli and Bacillus subtilis), which is significantly brighter than that in PBS only (Figure S18). The fluorescence increase is dependent
on the probe concentration. The confocal image (Figure 3) indicates that both E. coli and B. subtilis are stained by TPETH-2Zn after 30 min of incubation. It is noted that no
washing is required for image acquisition. For B. subtilis, the probe lights up the whole bacterial cell, including the membrane
and inner parts. For E. coli, although
the probe stains the whole bacterial cell in the majority of E. coli, it stains only the membrane in some E. coli (arrow in Figure 3A). This small difference indicates that
it is easier for the probe to penetrate into B. subtilis than into E. coli, as the latter
contains an extra outer membrane.19 On
the other hand, TPETH-2Zn only slightly stains HeLa cells
under the same conditions (Figures 3C and S19), indicating that
the probe prefers bacteria to mammalian cells. Together, these data
demonstrate that E. coli and B. subtilis, with negatively charged membranes, could
anchor, uptake, and aggregate the positively charged probe, which
restricts the intramolecular motion, leading to fluorescence.

Figure 3 Confocal (A–C)
and bright-field (D–F) images of E. coli (A, D) B. subtilis (B, E), and HeLa
cells (C, F) after incubation with the TPEPH-2Zn probe
(20 μM) for 30 min without any washing steps. The red
signal is collected above 590 nm upon excitation at 458 nm. All images
share the same scale bar of 10 μm.

As reported, TPETH also has good efficiency to generate singlet
oxygen species (1O2) under light irradiation.20 Next, we tested whether TPETH-2Zn has a similar ability to generate singlet oxygen. 9,10-Anthracenediylbis(methylene)dimalonic
acid (ABDA), which quickly decomposes upon reaction with 1O2, was used as an indicator of 1O2 generation. White light irradiation of the mixture of TPETH-2Zn and ABDA in water greatly diminishes the absorbance of ABDA. After
light irradiation for 2 min, around 90% of ABDA was consumed (Figure S20). The singlet oxygen quantum yield
for TPETH-2Zn is 77.6%, measured using Rose Bengal as
the reference.21 It should be noted that TPETH-2Zn exhibited a similar singlet oxygen generation ability
even after binding to bacteria (Figure S21), indicating that the design of AIE PS could offer an effective
singlet oxygen generation ability in the aggregated state.

Finally,
we applied TPETH-2Zn to photoablate bacteria.
In the dark, the probe shows little toxicity toward E. coli but high toxicity toward B.
subtilis, as 20 μM TPETH-2Zn could
kill nearly all of the B. subtilis but
only less than 10% of the E. coli (Figure 4A,B). The same trend
was also observed in our previous report, mainly because E. coli contains an extra outer protective membrane
as an effective barrier to PSs.14,19 Under irradiation with
white light (100 mW cm–2), 10 μM TPETH-2Zn could photoinactivate all of the B. subtilis and 60% of the E. coli (Figures 4A,B, S22, and S23). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
results indicate that the membranes of bacteria are damaged after
probe treatment and light irradiation (Figure 4C). It should be noted that under the same
experimental conditions the previous probe (AIE-ZnDPA, 10 μM)
could only photoinactivate about 80% of the B. subtilis and 10% of the E. coli, which is
around fivefold less toxicity than that of TPETH-2Zn.
This toxicity difference could partially be ascribed to the lower Kd of TPETH-2Zn than that of AIE-ZnDPA,
which favors bacterial binding in this case. It should be noted that TPETH-2Zn could not cause any dark or light toxicity toward
HeLa cells (Figure S24), indicating that
the AIE probe could selectively kill bacteria over mammalian cells
due to the different binding affinities.

irradiation. (C) SEM images of E. coli and B. subtilis treated with TPEPH-2Zn, with or without light irradiation. All images share
the same scale bar of 1 μm.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we used click chemistry (CuAAC)
to readily synthesize
a light-up AIE probe (TPETH-2Zn) that tightly binds zinc(II),
selectively images bacteria over mammalian cells, and potently exerts
phototoxicity to bacteria. The AIE probe, TPETH-2Zn,
is not emissive in aqueous solution but is able to turn on its emission
upon aggregate formation. As most bacteria contain significant
amounts of anionic phospholipids, which make their membrane negatively
charged,22TPETH-2Zn could
tightly bind to the bacterial surface, but not mammalian cell membranes,
and fluoresce. Benefiting from its low background signal, TPETH-2Zn does not require additional washing steps, which largely simplifies
the imaging procedure and detection sensitivity. Possessing excellent
singlet oxygen generation ability even after binding to bacteria, TPETH-2Zn potentially serves as an effective theranostic probe
for killing bacteria, which shall open new opportunities for the treatment
of bacterial infections.

Bacterial Labeling
The bacterial suspensions (E. coli or B. subtilis) at an OD600 of 0.2
in 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer
were incubated with TPETH-2Zn (20 μM) for 30 min
at room temperature. After incubation, the bacteria were harvested
by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min, the unbound TPETH-2Zn in the supernatant was discarded, and the bacteria were re-suspended
in PBS buffer for absorbance measurements. To study the fluorescence
of TPETH-2Zn upon binding to bacteria, these bacteria
were transferred to a 96-well plate in a volume of 100 μL/well,
with an OD600 of 0.1. Designated concentrations of TPETH-2Zn were then added into each well. After 30 min of incubation, the
fluorescence intensity at 650 nm upon excitation at 458 nm was recorded.
PBS was used as a negative control.

Confocal Imaging Experiments
The prepared bacterial
(B. subtilis and E.
coli) solutions were incubated with 20 μM TPETH-2Zn in the dark for 30 min at 37 °C. Individual
aliquots of 10 μL of the prepared suspension were spotted on
polylysine-pretreated glass slides and immobilized with coverslips.
The specimens were imaged immediately under a confocal laser scanning
microscope (CLSM; Zeiss). Excitation wavelength: 458 nm (1% laser
power); emission filter: LP590 nm. For confocal images of HeLa cells,
the HeLa cells were seeded in an eight-well chamber at 4 × 104 cells/mL. After overnight culturing, the HeLa cells were
incubated with TPETH-2Zn at a concentration of 20 μM
for 30 min. The cells were immediately imaged under a CLSM without
washing, using the same setup for bacterial imaging.

Antimicrobial
Assay
The antibacterial activity of TPETH-2Zn was studied by plating the diluted bacterial suspensions
on a solid Luria–Bertani (LB) agar plate. The bacteria were
harvested and re-suspended in 1× PBS with an OD600 of 0.5. Then,
90 μL of the bacterial suspension was added to a 96-well plate
and TPETH-2Zn was added to each well to achieve final
concentrations of 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 μM. The total volume
was kept
at 100 μL, and the plate was incubated in the dark at 37 °C
for 30 min. For the photodynamic antibacterial assay, the samples
in the 96-plate were illuminated with white light for 5 min at 100
mW cm–2. After irradiation, the bacterial suspensions
were serially diluted 0.5–1 × 105-fold with
1× PBS. A portion (100 μL) of the diluted bacterial cells
was spread on the solid LB agar plate and incubated at 37 °C
for 16 h. The colonies formed were
counted, and the survival rates of the bacteria were determined from
colony-forming unit counting on the solid LB agar plate with the control
in the dark without TPETH-2Zn treatment. For the control
in the dark, the irradiation step was replaced by incubation in the
dark for 6 min.

SEM Measurements
On the basis of
the antimicrobial
experiments, the concentration of TPETH-2Zn was determined
to be 20 μM for SEM measurements. The bacteria
were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min to remove the 1× PBS,
followed by irradiation. They were then suspended in and fixed with
2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2–3 h at room temperature. The glutaraldehyde
was removed by centrifugation, and the bacterial pellets were re-suspended
in sterile water; then, 10 μL of the bacterial suspension was
spotted onto the SEM conducting paste. After natural drying in air,
the bacteria were dehydrated with a series of graded ethanol solutions
(30, 50, 70, 80, 90, and 100% for 6 min). After drying overnight,
the specimens were coated with platinum before SEM measurements.
