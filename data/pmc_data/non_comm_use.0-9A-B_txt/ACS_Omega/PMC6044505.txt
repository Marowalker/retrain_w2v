Simple
solution combustion synthesis was adopted to synthesize
ZnO–ZnS (ZSx) nanocomposites using zinc nitrate
as an oxidant and a mixture of urea and thiourea as a fuel. A large
thiourea/urea ratio leads to more ZnS in ZSx with
heterojunctions between ZnS and ZnO and throughout the bulk; tunable
ZnS crystallite size and textural properties are an added advantage.
The amount of ZnS in ZSx can be varied by simply
changing the thiourea content. Although ZnO and ZnS are wide band
gap semiconductors, ZSx exhibits visible light absorption,
at least up to 525 nm. This demonstrates an effective reduction of
the optical band gap and substantial changes in its electronic structure.
Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and secondary-ion mass spectrometry results show features
due to ZnO and ZnS and confirm the composite nature with heterojunctions.
The above mentioned observations demonstrate the multifunctional nature
of ZSx. Bare ZSx exhibits a promising
sunlight-driven photocatalytic activity for complete mineralization
of endocrine disruptors such as 2,4-dichlorophenol and endosulphan.
ZSx also exhibits photocurrent generation at no applied
bias. Dye-sensitized solar cell performance evaluation with ZSx shows up to 4% efficiency and 48% incident photon conversion
efficiency. Heterojunctions observed between ZnO and ZnS nanocrystallites
in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy suggest the reason
for effective separation of electron–hole pairs and their utilization.

1 Introduction
Band gap engineering of wide band gap semiconductor materials is
one of the current research areas to harvest maximum visible light
absorption1,2a,2b because of
its potential applications in clean and renewable energy and pollution
abatement. Among various semiconductor oxides, TiO2 and
ZnO are accepted to be the best because of their abundance, chemical
stability, nontoxicity, and the efficiency for degradation of hazardous
pollutants; the holes produced by photon absorption in these materials
exhibit high oxidizing ability.3a,3b,4 Although TiO2 is considered the most important photocatalyst,
ZnO is also a suitable alternative photocatalyst because of its similar
band gap energy (3.37 eV), low cost, and higher electronic mobility
than TiO2.5,6 Moreover, in certain cases, ZnO
has high quantum efficiency and photocatalytic activity than TiO2.7−9 Nonetheless, because of significant photocorrosion,
ZnO has not been explored as thoroughly as TiO2. The common
form of Wurtzite ZnO is a well-known material with a direct band gap
of 3.37 eV and employed as a photocatalyst.3 In the past few decades, many results have been reported on the
synthesis of nanoscale ZnS crystals because of their special properties.10−13 However, ZnS absorbs only UV light and hence is less attractive
for solar light harvesting. Indeed, the ZnO–ZnS (ZSx) core–shell nanostructure has been predicted to
exhibit a band gap of 2.07 eV.13b

Various schemes have been adopted to increase the absorption of
visible light, including doping of impurities, sensitization with
quantum dots,14 and formation of heterostructure
semiconductor materials. Doping of anions and/or cations into the
ZnO or ZnS lattice has been attempted by a number of research groups,15−19 and this helps to reach many sophisticated applications, as its
electronic structure and properties can be modified significantly.
There are many reports on nitride and/or sulphide doping, which can
reduce the band gap and lead to visible light absorption in the semiconductor
materials.19−23 Although nitride is the best candidate for p-type doping in ZnO,
there are controversies, such as its not-so-easily reproducible nature,
N-content, that still exist.23,24 Mapa and Gopinath used
simple solution combustion method (SCM) to introduce nitrogen in the
ZnO lattice, but N 2p states were reported to be in the forbidden
gap.16 Introduction of cations into the
lattice of metal oxide causes thermal instability and invariably introduces
mid-gap energy states between the valence band (VB) and the conduction
band (CB) which act as recombination centres.25 Visible light absorption in the wide band gap semiconductor materials
has been developed by solid solution materials.26−30 A few groups have studied solid solutions, where
a significant improvement in photocatalytic activity was reported
with solar light due to red shift in the absorption edge and also
modification of textural properties. In 2009, Mapa et al.26 prepared (Zn1–zGaz)(O1–xNx)(ZnO–GaN) solid solution
by SCM; ZnO–GaN exhibits absorption in the visible light region
because of formation of solid solution with a band gap reduction.
The same group subsequently prepared (Zn1–zInz)(O1–xNx) (ZnO–InN)30 and (Zn1–z–yInzGay)(O1–xNx)(ZnO–InGaN)27 solid solutions
by adopting the SCM. Later, one was demonstrated to show overall water
splitting in the visible light and significant photoconversion efficiency.
On similar lines, formation of ZSx was expected to
change the electronic structure along with changes in electrical and
optical properties; however, the large difference between the ionic
sizes of O2– and S2– limits the
solubility of ZnS in ZnO or vice versa, though they belong to the
same structure group.31 Also, the synthesis
of ZnO–ZnS heterojunction remains a challenge.

In the
present communication, we report on ZSx composites
with heterojunction as an optoelectronic material for
photocurrent generation, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), and direct
solar light-driven photocatalysis. ZSx was prepared
by a simple SCM and without using any template in less than 10 min.
It was also demonstrated to show high activity for degradation of
endocrine disruptors (ECDs), such as endosulfan (ES) (6,7,8,9,10,10-hexachloro-1,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9
methano 2,4,3-benzo dioxathiepine-3-oxide), 2,4-dichloro phenol (2,4-DCP),
in direct sun light. The visible light photocatalytic activity under
direct sun light has been explained on the basis of the synergetic
electronic interaction of wurtzite ZnO and ZnS semiconductors as well
as the hetreojunctions in ZSx composites. The present
work is a part of ongoing efforts in our laboratories to understand
solar energy harvesting/conversion aspects.32−37

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural
and Textural Properties
2.1.1 X-ray Diffraction Studies
The structural
aspects of all ZSx catalysts have been explored by
PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction) measurements. Figure 1a,b shows a full and enlarged (21–38°)
XRD pattern of the ZSx materials, respectively. Urea/thiourea
employed for ZSx preparation varied from 100:0, 75:25,
50:50, and 25:75 to 0:100, and the resulting materials are designated
as Z1, ZS1, ZS2, ZS3, and ZS4, respectively. Details of characterization
methods are given in S1. It reveals that
the as-prepared materials exhibit a hexagonal wurtzite structure and
its diffraction pattern changes with the urea/thiourea ratio in the
preparation mixture. For the comparison purposes, XRD patterns of
ZnO, ZnS, and ZnSO4 and JCPDS patterns of ZnSO3 and Zn3O(SO4)2 were also included.
XRD patterns of pure ZnO and ZnS show a hexagonal wurtzite structure,
whereas ZnSO4 is of orthorhombic structure, and Zn3O(SO4)2 shows a monoclinic structure.18 The XRD pattern of Z1 is very similar to that
of ZnO, except for lattice contraction because of the introduction
of N into the lattice.16 The ionic radius
of S2– (1.84 Å) is higher than that of O2– (1.4 Å);18 further,
with variation in the ratio of urea to thiourea, average combustion
temperature and amount of sulfur introduced also change as well. In
the case of ZS1, the urea to thiourea ratio is high at 3 and it leads
to complete and fast combustion with high combustion temperature because
urea is known to be a good fuel.38 Hence,
under this combustion condition, a significant amount of sulfur gets
oxidized to sulfite, oxy sulfate, and/or sulfate of zinc. A 100% intense
peak for ZS1 was indexed to the hexagonal ZnO structure with a space
group of P63mc. Low intense
peaks observed between 21° and 31° (Figure 1b) are attributed to a mixture of oxy sulfate
and sulfate of zinc (Zn3O(SO4)2 and
ZnSO4), with the former dominant on ZS1. Very broad and
low intensity ZnS features could be seen on ZS1 at 28.7°, corresponding
to the (002) facet of ZnS,4 indicating
the oxidation of surface ZnS to sulfate-related features (Figure 1b).

different ratios of urea, along with ZnO and ZnS. Z1 is prepared with
urea alone. (b) Enlarged XRD pattern of ZSx materials

a shift in ZnO features (101) to a higher angle and a lattice contraction.
* and $ indicate ZnS and Si features, respectively. Dotted and dashed
lines are a guide to the eye.

In the case of ZS2, peak intensity for ZnSO4,
Zn3O(SO4)2 was suppressed enormously,
and
the ZnS features begin to appear (dashed arrows in Figure 1b). With increasing thiourea
content in the preparation mixture, the reaction atmosphere changes
predominantly toward sulfides along with ammonia. This is partially
due to the presence of no oxygen in thiourea compared to urea and
hence, enough amount of oxygen was not available for combustion. The
lack of oxygen in thiourea does not allow the oxidation of sulfide
and significant the ZnS phase is retained in the product. In other
words, the material preparation furnace chamber becomes filled increasingly
with in situ-produced reductants, such as H2S and ammonia,
with very less oxygen, to interact with nascent ZnxOy clusters in a short span of
time (≤1 min) under combustion conditions. This is the critical
condition which leads to ZSx. Gas product analysis
by IR confirms the formation of H2S and NH3.
Unlike ZS1 and ZS2, ZnS and predominant ZnO features were observed
for ZS3 and without any sulfate feature. Nonetheless, in ZS4, equally
strong diffraction features of both ZnO and ZnS are found together
without any other impurities. Thiourea (100%) was used as the fuel
for ZS4, which is likely the reason for incomplete oxidation of ZnxOy (x/y ≈ 2) clusters and favors ZnS formation,
under SCM conditions, attesting the successful use of thiourea as
a source of S. Sulfide species are not oxidized, which helps to form
a large amount of the hexagonal ZnS wurtzite phase. Therefore, distinct
and strong ZnS features are observed in the XRD pattern along with
ZnO. It is reasonable to conclude that a large ionic radius difference
between S2– (1.84 Å) and O2– (1.4 Å) generates the ZnS phase along with ZnO in ZS2, ZS3,
and ZS4. It is speculated that the structural similarity of ZnS and
ZnO helps to form the heterojunctions in a 1:1 ratio; however, this
needs careful verification. Not only the diffraction pattern, but
also the relative intensity of the diffraction lines of as-prepared
materials varied with the changing thiourea content in the reaction
mixture. With no or low thiourea content, good crystallinity of Z1
and ZS1 can be observed, as they show very sharp peaks. However, with
increasing thiourea content (ZS2) in the preparation mixture, crystallinity
of the material decreases, and FWHM of the peaks increases, with the
significant peak broadening because of smaller crystallite sizes of
ZnS. However, this trend reverses with further increase in the thiourea
content, and the crystallite size of ZnS increases, as shown in Table 1. Indeed, this observation
demonstrates the possibility of fine tuning the ZnS crystallite size
as well as its amount in ZSx. A shift in ZnO diffraction
features to a higher angle from Z1 to ZS4 suggests a minor contraction
of lattice parameters.

c Crystallite size was calculated

d Crystallite size was measured after
calcination at 650 °C.

Thermal stability of ZSx was explored with XRD
after ex situ calcination of ZS4 and ZS1 at different temperatures
for 4 h in air, and the results are shown in Figure S1a,b, respectively. No significant change in the intensity
of ZnS and ZnO features was observed at ≤400 °C. However,
the intensity of ZnS peaks decreases, and a simultaneous increase
in the intensity of ZnO features occurs, especially for the materials
calcined at ≥500 °C. The above mentioned changes are attributed
to the systematic oxidation of ZnS to ZnO under air atmosphere with
an increase in calcination temperature. To have a better understanding
of thermal treatment, XRD patterns of ZS4 were recorded in situ at
temperatures between 480 and 700 °C, and the results are depicted
in Figure 2. Peaks
due to ZnS (ZnO) decrease (increases) in intensity as the temperature
increases >480 °C, with the occurrence of a simultaneous broadening
(narrowing) demonstrating a reduction (increase) in the crystallite
size. Maximum changes in intensity and peak broadening of ZnS features
occur between 560 and 650 °C, suggesting that the size reduction
is relatively fast in the above mentioned temperature regime; however,
a longer heating time at lower temperatures or heating in dilute oxygen
atmosphere is expected to generate similar changes in a controlled
manner. ZS4 at 700 °C shows only a trace amount of ZnS features,
suggesting an almost complete oxidation to ZnO. An important underlying
point in the above mentioned experiment is the controlled size reduction
of ZnS between 400 and 650 °C, which could be utilized to prepare
a controlled ZnS particle size in the ZSx matrix.
The above mentioned bottom-up approach is likely to control the crystallite
size better than other methods, especially in the solid state. A simultaneous
increase in the intensity of ZnO features further supports the oxidation
of ZnS to ZnO.

Figure 2 Powder XRD patterns of ZS4 recorded in situ between 480
and 700
°C show a systematic decrease in the crystallite size of ZnS.
An arrow mark indicates the formation of a new phase and it is yet
to be identified.

2.1.2 Surface
Area Analysis
Nitrogen
adsorption–desorption isotherms have been measured to investigate
the textural properties of porous ZSx materials. Figure 3a shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm results obtained at
77 K and analyzed by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method
for surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method
for pore size distribution in Figure 3b; surface area and porosity have been calculated,
and the results are given in Table 1. All materials show a type III adsorption–desorption
isotherm with a H3 hysteresis loop that demonstrates the presence
of mesopores and macropores.39 Predominantly,
mesopores are observed for ZS1 with a surface area of 5 m2/g (Table 1). An increase
in the amount of thiourea increases the surface area to 8 and 15 m2/g for ZS2 and ZS3, respectively, with marginal changes in
the pore size and pore volume (not shown). In the case of ZS4, the
surface area increases to 20 m2/g because of formation
of more pores, and it is fully supported by microscopy results.

at 77 K and (b) BJH-pore size distribution pattern for ZS1, ZS2, ZS3,
and ZS4 materials.

2.1.3 Thermogravimetric
Analysis
Figure 4 depicts the thermal
analysis of (a) ZS4 in air and N2 and (b) ZS1 and ZS2 in
air atmosphere and compared with that of ZnS and ZnSO4·7H2O (in b), respectively. ZS1, ZS2, and ZS4 shows about 2–3%
weight loss up to 150 °C because of the elimination of water
and adsorbed components. Between 150 and 570 °C, the ZS4 material
shows hardly any weight loss, and a sharp weight gain of 2.5% was
observed between 570 and 680 °C. Weight loss begins >680 °C
and continues up to 850 °C. On comparison of ZS4 results with
those of ZnS in air, it can be directly inferred that the weight gain
between 570 and 680 °C is mainly due to the oxidation of ZnS
to a sulfate/sulfite-like compound. Thermal analysis of a ZS4 material
in an N2 atmosphere shows no weight gain between 500 and
650 °C, and a rather minor weight loss was observed between 600
and 700 °C, which clearly suggest that any oxidation is fully
prevented in an N2 atmosphere. The thermogravimetry (TG)
result in air atmosphere is supported by the XRD of a calcined material
at different temperatures; however, no sulfate features observed in
XRD (Figure 2) are
attributed to the decomposition of sulfate species under in situ heating
conditions. Besides, this also suggests that the reaction temperature
under SCM conditions might be between 600 and 680 °C for sulfate
formation in the cases of ZS1 and ZS2, and lower than 570 °C
for ZS3 and ZS4. An exothermic peak observed in the differential thermal
analysis (DTA) curve of ZS4 at 690 °C similar to that of ZnS
at 660 °C supports the oxidation of sulfide. A significant shift
in the temperature of the above mentioned peak for ZS4 indicated a
relatively better thermal stability for ZSx composites
compared to bulk ZnS. However, a shift of +30 °C observed in
the DTA exotherm for ZS4 is likely due to the distribution of smaller
ZnS clusters in the well-protected ZnO host lattice. It is well-known
in the literature27,30 that the protected clusters,
like the above mentioned, exhibit better thermal stability. Weight
loss observed between 680 and 850 °C is due to decomposition
of sulfate and/or oxysulfates of zinc to ZnO and the distribution
of smaller clusters of ZnS in well-protected ZnO, and it is in good
correspondence with ZnSO4·7H2O results
(Figure 4b). No significant
weight loss occurs above mentioned 850 °C and supports a complete
removal of sulfur from ZS4. The weight loss pattern observed for ZS1/ZS2
materials is quite different in air atmosphere compared to that for
ZS4.

and ZnSO4·7H2O carried out in air (and
nitrogen for ZS4) atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
DTA of respective materials carried out in air atmosphere is given
in the corresponding insets.

TG–DTA results of ZnSO4·7H2O
given in Figure 4b
is worth comparing with those of ZS1/ZS2. For a pure ZnSO4·7H2O compound, there is an initial weight loss of
about 42% up to 250 °C in two phases; this is due to the loss
of water of crystallization. About 5–6% weight loss observed
up to 270 °C on ZS1/ZS2 is mainly due to adsorbed water. A sharp
weight loss of 29% observed between 700 and 880 °C for ZnSO4·7H2O is attributed to the decomposition of
sulfate to oxide. Indeed, the weight loss observed between 600 and
850 °C (Figure 4a) is due to the decomposition of ZnSO4 to ZnO. The loss
of SO2/SO3 leads to weight loss in TG. It is
to be noted the endothermic nature of ZnSO4 decomposition,
in contrast to the exothermic oxidation of ZnS to ZnSO4 followed by decomposition. In a similar manner, ZS1 and ZS2 show
a weight loss of 13 and 7%, respectively, between 550 and 850 °C.
Low weight loss with ZS2 hints at a low sulfate and high ZnS content.

2.1.4 SEM and HRTEM
The morphology and
the textural properties of ZSx materials were explored
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM). From the SEM images of as-prepared ZSx materials shown in Figure 5, it is clear that the materials exhibit pores of the
order of 1–10 μm, and they are macroporous in nature.
The porous nature of the materials was well-supported by surface area
analysis. It is also important to compare the morphology and textural
properties of Z1 to ZSx materials. Z1 shows a ordered
hexagonal pyramid without any pore.16 Indeed,
the well-ordered microcrystals observed in Figure 5a for Z1 highlights the compact micro crystals
of ZnO1–xNx; an enlarged image of a single hexagonal particle from the
top view is shown in the Figure 5a inset. Further, the surface area of Z1 is also very
low at 1 m2/g, which underscores the above mentioned point.
ZS1 shows a porous structure with a needle-shaped particle, highlighting
the role of thiourea in changing the surface and particle morphology.

Figure 5 SEM images
of (a) Z1, (b) ZS1, (c) ZS3, and (d) ZS4 and HRTEM images
of (e) ZS3 and (f) ZS4. Transparent white patches (indicated by blue
squares) observed on ZS1 are due to sulfate/sulfite. One-dimensional
needle-shaped particles observed on ZS1 change to V-shaped morphology
on ZS4. Z1 shows triangle and hexagonal prisms in panel (a). Inset
in panel (e) shows line profile analysis to show a progressive change
in the d value from ZnS to ZnO measured in the bottom-right side.
The number of heterojunctions is evident in ZS3 and ZS4 given in panels
(e,f).

Needle-shaped one-dimensional
particles observed predominantly
are attributed to ZS1 and ZS2, and transparent white patches observed
on ZS1 (at top left and bottom right above the scale bar on Figure 5b) are attributed
to sulfate-/sulfite-related compounds on the surface. On moving from
ZS1 to ZS4, the above mentioned sulfate-related compounds decrease
in content, and the particle morphology also changes drastically from
a one-dimensional needle to two-dimensional V-shaped arrays with an
edge size of about 1.5 μm at an angle of 72°. Indeed, the
surface area also increases from 5 to 20 m2/g from ZS1
to ZS4, respectively, indicating an increased porosity from ZS1 to
ZS4. EDX analysis was carried out to measure the material composition
as well as to find out the extent of uniform distribution over a large
surface area (1 mm2). Representative EDX results are given
in Figure S2 for ZS2 and ZS4, and they
support uniform distribution of all elements.

HRTEM results
of ZS3 and ZS4 are shown in Figure 5e,f, respectively. Distinct d-spaces
observed (0.29 and 0.26 nm) correspond to ZnS(101) and ZnO(002)
facets, respectively, in both panels. Careful analysis reveals the
abundant availability of heterojunctions between ZnO and ZnS and confirms
the formation of ZnO–ZnS heterojunctions. Indeed, many such
heterojunctions observed in several samples, prepared in different
batches hints at the reliability of the method and measurements. Line
profile analysis shown in the Figure 5e inset shows a clear change in the d value from ZnS to ZnO. The central rectangular box shows a gradual
change in ZnS to ZnO. In fact, this indicates a possibility of the
presence of solid solution to some extent. Thiourea and urea dissociate
to generate in situ ammonia and H2S gaseous products at
500 °C, which helps to form ZSx composites with
ZnO–ZnS heterojunctions.

2.1.5 Optical
Absorption
It is well-known
that anion doping affects light absorption characteristics of any
oxide material,19 and ZnO is not an exception.
Diffuse reflectance UV–visible spectra of ZSx composites are shown in Figure 6a and compared with reference materials [ZnS, ZnO,
and a physical mixture (ZnS–ZnO = 7:3)]. It is to be noted
that ZnS and ZnO show absorption cutoff around 340 and 375 nm, respectively.
However, the absorption cutoff is extended, at least, to 470 nm for
all ZSx materials; ZS4 shows absorption up to 550
nm. A red shift is observed with increasing ZnS content from ZS1 to
ZS4, and it is attributed to the modified chemical environment because
of the formation of the heterojunction of ZnS and ZnO. Further ZnS
crystallite sizes measured from XRD (Figures 1 and 2) suggest an
increasing size from ZS1 to ZS4 which is in good agreement with the
above mentioned red shift.

Figure 6 (a) Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra
of the ZSx materials along with ZnO, ZnS, and a physical
mixture
of ZnS and ZnO (7:3). A digital photograph is shown in the inset of
panel (a) for the color associated with ZSx. (b)
Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra of ZS4 (inset ZS1) materials
calcined at 550 and 800 °C and ZnO.

This is further confirmed from the absorption spectrum recorded
for a 7:3 physical mixture of ZnS–ZnO, which exhibits absorption
due to ZnS up to 340 nm and up to 375 nm due to ZnO, as expected.
A physical mixture of any ratio of ZnS and ZnO does not exhibit absorption
>375 nm supporting ZSx with heterojunctions between
ZnS and ZnO. Band gap energies calculated from the diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy results for ZSx show a prominent decrease
with increasing ZnS content. The band gap calculated from the absorption
spectral data for ZS4 is 2.67 eV, suggesting a significant band gap
reduction and changes in the electronic structure of ZSx composites compared to the pure components. However, a careful analysis
of absorption by ZS3 and ZS4 reveals that the former absorbs more
visible light with a considerably high absorption coefficient, especially
between 400 and 500 nm. The band gap diminution of the ZSx composites has been attributed to the formation of hybrid bands/orbitals
of ZnO and ZnS at the heterojunctions or interfaces. It is expected
that S 3p and O 2p are likely to overlap in the VB, and the extent
of overlap increases from ZS1 to ZS4 because of the increasing extent
of heterojunctions. Sulfur exists as an anion (S2–) in ZS3 and ZS4, and the top of VB might be predominantly composed
of S 3p energy levels, as they have higher orbital energies than O
2p levels. Thus, in the VB of ZSx, S 3p and O 2p
bands overlap and broaden the VB than in ZnO or ZnS. It is expected
that the CB of ZS1-ZS4 is formed by Zn 3d as well as S 3d orbitals.
Our experimental results are in good agreement with DFT predictions
by Schrier et al.13b for the ZnO–ZnS
planar superlattice with a band gap of 2.31 eV. ZS1 and ZS4 calcined
at high temperatures have been subjected to optical absorption studies,
and the results are shown in Figure 6b. They exhibit a systematic decrease in the visible
light absorption at calcination temperatures >550 °C.

2.1.6 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Core-level spectra
of S 2p and N 1s are compared in Figure 7, and the results from Zn 2p3/2, O 1s, and survey spectra are given in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). It can be
seen from Figure 7a
that the S 2p core level displays two different peaks at binding energy
(BE) around 168.5 and 161.5 eV. A comparison of the observed BE to
that of reported values for different sulfur compounds demonstrates
that the oxidation state of S at 161.5 eV is due to S2– as in typical sulfides, and at 168.5 eV is due to S6+ as in sulfate or oxysulfate.13 The peak
at 161.5 eV corresponds to ZnS and demonstrates the formation of ZnS
in ZSx. On ZS1 and ZS2, a characteristic, but broad,
peak for sulfide was found with low intensity, along with a majority
of sulfate on the surface. The sulfide feature increases in intensity
from ZS1 to ZS4 and directly supports the observation of XRD. The
above mentioned observation supports the oxidation of sulfide species
on the surface to sulfate under preparation conditions. Nonetheless,
sulfate formation is mostly restricted to the surface on ZS3 and ZS4,
and no feature corresponding to sulfate has been observed in any of
the bulk characterizations, such as XRD, Raman, and secondary-ion
mass spectrometry (SIMS). It is clear from Figure 7a that with increasing thiourea content in
the preparation mixture, the total sulfur content on the surface increases,
which was demonstrated in the elemental mapping of ZS4 (Figure S2f). This can be clearly seen in the
prepared material (in ZS3 and ZS4), where a prominent peak for sulfide
and some sulfate was observed. Because of combustion conditions, some
sulfate formation on the surface cannot be avoided; however, it can
be removed by simple washing with water.

spectra obtained from (a) S 2p
and (b) N 1s core levels of ZSx.

The N 1s core level appears at around 399.5 ± 0.2 eV
for all
ZSx (Figure 7b) materials, suggesting the nature of nitrogen on the surface,
especially that the charge density is similar to that of ammonia.16 It is also surprising that the nature of N remains
the same on all ZSx compositions and increasing ZnS
content did not change the nature. However, no nitride phase such
as Zn3N2 was found. Moreover, the amount of
surface nitrogen decreases from Z1 to ZS4, and it is also in correspondence
to the bulk N-content (Table 1) estimated by EDX. We attribute this trend to the N doping
in the ZnO lattice, and no significant role in photocatalysis is expected,
which is in line with ZnO1–xNx.16 The BE values
for the Zn 2p3/2 region was found at 1021.9 ± 0.1
eV, which is in agreement with literature values reported for ZnO
(1022 eV) and ZnS (1021.9 eV) (see the Supporting Information Figure S3).16,26 The O 1s core level
also shows a typical oxide feature for Z1 at 529.4 eV. Nonetheless,
the main O 1s peak appears at 531.8 eV for all ZSx materials uniformly because of sulfate, whereas the ZnO feature
was suppressed because of preferential sulfate formation.

2.1.7 Raman Spectra
Raman spectra of
ZSx materials along with Z1, ZnO, and ZnS were measured,
and the results are shown in Figure 8. Distinct Raman modes {E2, longitudinal
optical [A1(LO)] and transverse optical [A1(TO)]}
are observed for ZnO, ZnS, and Z1.39 ZnS
shows characteristic phonon modes with high intensity at 428 (2E2) and 711 cm–1 [A1/E1(2LO)], and two other features at 492 and 611 (2TO) cm–1. All the above mentioned four modes were observed for ZS1 to ZS4
materials. A strong and sharp peak observed at 433 cm–1 on all ZSx materials, 437 cm–1 on ZnO, and 429 cm–1 on ZnS is due to the typical
E2 (high) mode, and this mode is characteristic of the
wurtzite phase. Among the Raman modes, the E2 (high) at
437 cm–1 shows the strongest intensity in ZnO and
on all ZSx materials, indicating the high quality
of the material. The presence of the above mentioned mode in ZSx materials indicates that they exhibit the same local geometry.
Nonetheless, it is to be noted that all ZSx materials
exhibit the 2E2 mode at 433 cm–1 and
exactly in between the E2 modes of ZnO and ZnS, indicating
the strong interaction of ZnO and ZnS with the formation of the heterojunction
nature of ZSx materials. Broad-and low-intensity
features observed for ZS1 are likely due to sulfate species present
in it; however, no new mode for sulfate species was observed. Indeed,
it is surprising that first-order E2 and A1/E1(LO) phonon modes are not observed; rather second-order 2E2 and A1/E1(2LO) modes are observed with
high intensity for ZnS as well as ZSx. In addition
to the above, broad peaks are observed at 497 cm–1 on ZSx materials, which does not belong to the
first- or second-order structure of neither ZnO nor ZnS; further,
this mode is not observed for ZS1, suggesting that this is not due
to sulfate-related species also. Although XRD does not show prominent
ZnS features for ZS2, Raman results show the same, highlighting the
formation of ZnS in ZS2. Sharp peaks at 507 and 582 cm–1 in Z1 are attributed to A1(LO) due to N-doping.16,39

compared with
Z1, ZnS, and ZnO.

2.1.8 SIMS
Analysis
SIMS analysis results
obtained are shown in Figure 9. Initially, the recorded mass spectrum (not shown) demonstrated
the presence of different species, namely, Zn, S, ZnO, ZnN, ZnS, N,
and O with significant to high counts. Secondary-ion intensities of
the first five species are shown in Figure 9, as a function of sputtering time or depth.
No change in counts/intensity of any species with sputtering time
emphasizes the introduction of S throughout the bulk of ZSx and the uniformity of the distribution throughout the
bulk. Further, S-related fragments dominate over N-related fragments,
indicating that the N content is relatively lower. This is further
confirmed from the SIMS results from Z1, in which N and Zn–N
exhibit higher intensity than Zn–N in ZSx.16 Indeed, any species that exhibits 10 counts/s
and less is not considered because of low signal/noise and poor reliability.

Figure 9 SIMS results display secondary-ion intensities measured
as a function
of sputtering depth or time for (a) ZS1, (b) ZS4, and (c) Z1.

It is fully surprising that a
heavier element like S does compete
with N, and preferential ZnS formation occurs under combustion conditions.
Nonetheless, counts for all species were significantly different on
Z1, ZS1, and ZS4, indicating that the material characteristic has
changed significantly from each other. Higher count rates are observed
for Zn–N than Zn–O fragments, despite ZnO being the
host lattice in Z1, which is attributed to the different ionization
capacity of emitted species, and this is strongly dependent on the
local surface characteristics of the materials, known as the matrix
effect.40 Although the bulk N content in
ZS1 is half that of Z1, very low Zn–N fragments observed on
ZS1 reiterates that the ionization capacity varies for the same fragment
from material to material, especially when the nature of the materials
changed significantly. An important point to be mentioned here is
that no other N- and S-related species, such as N2, NO,
ZnNO, ZnSO, NHx, SOx (x = 1–4), and NS, are observed in
SIMS, which suggests that the status of N and S in ZnO1–xNx and ZSx materials is none of the above. It is also surprising to note the
absence of SOx, in spite of sulphate/sulphite
species observed in other methods. As indicated by other characterizations,
the nature of sulfur changes increasingly toward sulfide from ZS1
to ZS4.

2.1.9 Chronoamperometry
Photo-electrochemical
measurement was carried out using three electrode assemblies in a
0.5 M NaClO4 electrolyte to understand the light harvesting
character. A photoresponsive material was casted on a fluorine-doped
tin oxide plate and evaluated for photocurrent generation under illumination.
Chronoamperometry measurement (at 0 V vs Ag/AgCl) was carried out
to study the instantaneous photoresponse of the materials, and the
results are shown in Figure 10. Two types of measurements were carried out, namely, AM 1.5
(100 mW/cm2) and with a 400 nm (92 mW/cm2) cutoff
filter to follow the photocurrent change and efficiency of visible
light absorption. Among all catalysts, ZS4 generates an at least 4-fold
and 2-fold higher current than ZS1 or ZS2, and ZS3, respectively (Figure 10a) under irradiation
conditions. It demonstrates the effective absorption of light by ZS4,
and the large number of heterojunctions present helps achieve high
current than other compositions; in fact, the high surface area and
porosity associated with ZS4 helps this. No current was produced under
dark (shutter close) conditions, confirms the photofunctional behavior
of ZSx materials. The photocurrent-generated value
shows less in the visible light region than AM 1.5 (Figure 10a) because of no UV light
in the 400 nm filtered light (Figure 10b). This observation demonstrates the necessity to
utilize the small amount UV light (4–5%) in the solar radiation
(1 sun condition) to maximize solar harvesting. Further, 3.5-fold
higher current generation observed for ZS4 than ZS3 underscores the
effective absorption of visible light (Figure 10b) and charge separation
by ZS4. High photocurrent generated from ZS4 is attributed to better
necking between the particles, which is essential for electron conduction.
The extent of necking is relatively higher with ZS4 than ZS3, and
hence the former shows higher current. Because of high photocurrent
generation, ZS4 and ZS3 show better quantum efficiency in DSSC measurement
and high photocatalytic degradation of ECD than ZS1 or ZS2, which
is described below.

Figure 10 Photocurrent measurement under (a) AM1.5 (ZS1, ZS2, ZS3,
and ZS4)
and (b) 400 nm (ZS4 and ZS3).

3 Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells
Figure 11a and Table 2 show the J–V curves and the photovoltaic
(PV) performances of DSSC devices, respectively, based on the photoanodes
using ZnO and ZSx composites under 1 sun irradiation
(AM 1.5G solar simulation). Typical ZnO-based cells exhibit Voc—0.53 V, Jsc—4.95 mA/cm2, fill factor (FF)—59%, and
η—1.53%. The PV performance linearly increases by varying
the composition of sulfur from ZS1 to ZS4. ZS4 exhibits the best PV
performance (Voc—0.67 V; Jsc—8.45 mA/cm2; FF—69%;
and η—3.8%) than other ZSx materials
and bare ZnO. This was further confirmed by the incident photon conversion
efficiency (IPCE) spectra (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information), wherein bare ZnO shows 30% conversion
and ZS4 shows 48%. The SEM results reveal the porous nature and the
high surface area for ZS4, which induce the photogenerated carriers
to diffuse fast to the surface and react rapidly with the adsorbed
molecules. More interestingly, the effective transport of charge carriers
at the heterojunction between ZnO and ZnS helps to minimize the recombination
which is proven by high FF (69%) for ZS4.

ZnO, ZS1, ZS2, ZS3, and ZS4. (b) Nyquist plots of all PV cells under

dipped into 0.5 mM
of acetonitrile/tert-butanol (1:1) for 6 h.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) is a powerful tool
to investigate the internal resistance and the charge-transfer process
in DSSC.41 Charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of ZnO and the composites were obtained
from Nyquist plots (Figure 11b) under light illumination (100 mW/cm2) at the
photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. From the EIS analysis, Rct (Cμ) and
electron lifetime (τr) were calculated and are summarized
in Table 2. τr was calculated by the following equation; τr = Rct × Cchem; (Cchem = chemical capacitance).
τr reflects the response time constant for recombination
which is correlated with Voc. A ZS4-based
photoanode exhibited the smallest charge-transfer resistance (23 Ω),
with highest chemical capacitance (18 μF/cm2) and
electron lifetime (4.1 ms), indicating faster charge transport and
lower recombination across the interface of photoelectrode. Compared
to ZS4, all other ZSx composites show higher Rct, and τr and smaller Cchem. This underscores the better charge separation
characteristics associated with ZS4, which is expected to generally
increase the solar harvesting performance.

3.1 Photocatalytic
Degradation of 2,4-DCP in Direct
Sun Light
2,4-DCP can be considered as a model compound for
ECD, and its degradation was carried out as a model reaction to evaluate
the photocatalytic oxidation ability of ZSx. Figure 12 shows the UV–vis
absorption spectrum recorded for aqueous 2,4-DCP solution that was
irradiated under direct sun light for different time periods with
ZS3 (Figure 12a) and
ZS4 (Figure 12b).
Two absorption bands (broad band below 240 and at 285 nm) are observed
for 100% DCP or before the onset of degradation; the weaker band in
270–300 nm range corresponds to π–π* and
n−π* transitions that are characteristic of benzene and
its substituted derivatives.42 Significant
photocatalytic degradation is evident from the results observed in Figure 12 by ZS3 and ZS4.
A linear decrease in 2,4-DCP degradation is evident from the decrease
in the band intensity of both peaks. In fact, ZS3 and ZS4 show a similar
trend in activity. Although absorption intensity decreases in Figure 12, there is hardly
any mineralization of fragmented components to CO2. Nonetheless,
fragmented components can be mineralized relatively easier than the
parent DCP.

Figure 12 Absorption spectra of 2,4-DCP solution recorded at different
time
intervals following photodegradation with (a) ZS3 and (b) ZS4 catalyst.

The activity measurements were
also carried out with all ZSx materials in direct
sunlight. Necessary control experiments
were also carried out. Further, a UV lamp (λ = 240–400
nm; predominantly, 365 nm and 240–320 nm) or H2O2 (2 mL of 25% H2O2 in direct sunlight;
see Figure S5) was employed to measure
the 2,4-DCP degradation activity with ZS3. Figure 13 compares the activity of all catalysts
for 2,4-DCP degradation. Control experiments, such as pure ZnO and
ZnS, show low activity (20–25% degradation) in 10 h. However,
all ZSx catalysts show significant activity for 2,4-DCP
degradation in direct sunlight. The bulk heterostructure of ZSx leads to absorption of visible light and shows better
activity for 2,4-DCP degradation under direct sun light. The λ-max
at 285 nm for the absorption of 2,4-DCP (Figure 12) reduced as reaction time increased. Indeed,
complete 2,4-DCP degradation occurs in about 10 h with ZS2, ZS3, and
ZS4 catalysts under direct sun light as well as in UV light irradiation.
This underscores the visible light activity associated with ZSx materials. The activity of all other catalysts follows
the order given below: ZS3 > ZS4 > ZS2 > ZS1. High surface
area and
pore volume in ZS3 and ZS4 adsorb a large amount of reactants on the
catalyst surface; because of highly crystallinity and small particle
size, the photogenerated charge carriers diffuse fast to the surface
of the catalyst and react rapidly with 2,4-DCP and hence an effective
utilization of charge carrier for the oxidation.31 In the presence of H2O2, the reaction
was very fast, and 2,4-DCP degradation was completed in 3 h. It demonstrates
the formation of the hydroxyl radical from photocleavage of H2O2 during the light irradiation which increases
the oxidation of 2,4-DCP.20 This reveals
the importance of the hydroxyl radical for oxidation reaction and
assists the reaction. Indeed, without a catalyst or in the absence
of light, no activity was observed, which suggests that the degradation
reaction occurs under a photocatalytic reaction path way. There is
a finite difference in reactivity occurs between ZS3 and ZS4. ZS3
exhibits a small crystallite size (20 nm) with significantly high
visible light absorption, which is highly required for the decomposition
of ECD, whereas ZS4 shows a high crystallite size (50 nm) and a surface
area with good necking between particles, which enhance the electron
conduction and hence lead to high photocurrent generation. This underscores
the necessity to have optical absorption, electrical conduction, and
microstructural properties in a supplementing manner to achieve higher
activity as well as photocurrent. The corresponding first-order kinetics
plot and rate constant are shown in Figure S6, indicating the superior activity associated with ZS3 among ZSx catalysts. Indeed, either in the presence of UV light
or sunlight, peroxide increases the rate constant effectively.

degradation activity for 2,4-DCP with ZSx under direct
sun light and UV light.

3.2 Photocatalytic Degradation of ES
ES is a toxic chemical and was employed as a pesticide around the
globe in the past without realizing the harmful effects on human beings.
Till date, an ES-infested agricultural land could not be used in many
countries. ES exists as a mixture of α and β isomers,
and its consumption through farm products or inhalation creates genetic
problems in human beings and animals.43 A small amount (2 μg/mL) of ES is harmful for male fertility
and affects the endocrine system. Because of harmful effects, biodegradation
of ES was carried out by enzymes44 at a
specific pH. It requires several days to degrade ES into its fragments
and involves several steps to grow the microorganism in a suitable
environment.45 It is further limited by
low degradation efficiency with high toxic metabolites, and hence
a complete mineralization by cheap alternative methods, such as photocatalysis,
is required.46 Thomas et al., reported
photocatalytic activity studies of Ag- and Au-incorporated TiO2 for degradation of ES under solar light irradiation.46b,46c

There are few reports on photocatalytic degradation of ES
under UV light irradiation.46e−46i Sivagami et al.46f studied the photocatalytic
activity of TiO2 for the degradation of ES predominantly
under UV light (254 nm). Similarly, Tapia-Orozco and Vázquez
employed photoactive TiO2 films for ES degradation in UV
light.46g Very limited studies were carried
out so far, and complete mineralization is yet to be realized in a
sustainable manner. In the present study, photocatalytic degradation
of aqueous ES was carried out under direct sun light irradiation using
ZS3 and ZS4 without using any other component, such as noble metal
co-catalyst or peroxide, and the results are shown in Figure 14. Decomposition of ES was
indicated by UV–vis absorption and confirmed by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. A very similar pattern of photocatalytic
degradation of ES as a function of irradiation time is shown by ZS4
(Figure 14a) and ZS3
(Figure 14b). Virgin
ES shows an absorption band at 215–225 nm due to π–π*
transition. However, two new absorption peaks appear at higher wavelengths
as a function of direct sunlight irradiation time; new absorption
peaks appeared at 243 and 282 nm corresponding to π–π*
and n−π* transition from one of the fragments or the
decomposed product attesting the decomposition of ES into other products.
The absorption feature around 200 nm keeps increasing with increasing
illumination time, hinting the decomposition of ES into several products
or small fragments, which contribute to the high intensity at 200
nm. The absorption feature due to ES at 215 nm disappears gradually.
This observation demonstrates the formation of a new product increased
with irradiation time. Nonetheless, it was not possible to confirm
the complete degradation of ES and the nature of fragments or products
because of decomposition from absorption spectral studies. To explore
more on this aspect, GC–MS analysis was carried out for pure
ES and products or fragments that remain in solution after 60 h of
continuous solar irradiation over eight days with the ZS4 catalyst.

Figure 14 Absorption
spectra of aqueous ES recorded at different time intervals
following photodegradation with (a) ZS4 and (b) ZS3.

GC–MS analysis shows two isomer peaks of
ES α and
β at retention times (Rt) 16.4 and 17.6 min, as shown in Figure 15a (and Figure S7a). Corresponding mass spectra for ES α and β are given
in Figure S7b,c. After 60 h of sunlight
irradiation, no peak corresponding to α and β ES was observed
in GC (Figure 15b);
however, many new features are observed, which is attributed to the
various fragments from the decomposition of ES, and the corresponding
mass spectrum of each new fragment is given in Figure S8 (1–10). All possible products are listed
in Table S1. Rt = 3.378 min (Figure S8-1) shows mass fragmentations at m/z 118 (C9H10+), 103 (C8H7+), 91 (C7H7+), 77 (C6H5+), 44 (C2H4O+), and 32 (CH4O+);
chemical composition of this fragment is C10H12O, and the probability for the same is 97.9%. Figure S8-2 shows a typical mass fragmentation of α-methylbenzyl
alcohol from the feature at Rt = 4.128 min; the relative mass fragmentation observed at m/zs 122 (M+=C8H10O+), 120 (C8H8O+), 107 (M+–CH3), 105 (C7H5O+), 79 (C6H7+), 77 (C6H5+), and 44 (C2H4O+) supports this. It is well-studied that
benzene derivatives give a phenylium ion peak at m/z 77 and observed that the probability of α-methylbenzyl
alcohol is 50.1% by the NIST library.45Figure S8-3 shows the MS corresponding
to Rt = 4.225 min, and
it exactly matches with the m/z patterns
of acetophenone with a probability of 70%.45 The observed mass fragments are m/z = 120 (M+), 105 (M–CH3CO+; C7H5O+), 77 (C6H5+), and 43 (CH3CO+). The
mass spectrum of the next feature that appeared at Rt = 4.42 min (Figure S8-4) matches with that of 2-phenyl-2-propenol with a probability
of 92%; this feature shows a parent peak at m/z 136 (M+=C9H12O+), and the following fragment peaks appeared at m/z 121 (M+–CH3), 118
M+–H2O), 103 (C8H7+), 91 (C7H8+), 77 (C6H5+), and 43 (CH3CO+). Last two features are the major products observed in the GC pattern
because of ES degradation. Observation of these products attests dechlorination
of ES in the first step followed by formation of acetophenone or 2-phenyl-2-propenol.
Indeed, this is an important observation because dechlorination of
ES makes the resulting products to a simple organic molecule that
can be photocatalytically degraded easily. Further, it removes the
harmful nature that leads to endocrine disruption.

Figure 15 GC results obtained
for (a) ES and (b) ES fragments after 60 h
of irradiation under direct sunlight with a ZS4 catalyst. Corresponding
mass spectral patterns and identity are given in Figure S8 and Table S1, respectively.

A minor feature observed at Rt = 5.65 min can be attributed
to octanol from the mass spectrum
(Figure S8-5) with a chemical composition
of M+=C8H18O+ exhibiting
major mass fragments at m/z 111
(C8H15+), 97 (C7H13+), 83 (C6H11+), 69(C5H9+), 55 (C4H7+), 44 (C3H8+),
and 32 (CH4O+). Another minor feature at Rt = 8.2 min shows mass fragments
(Figure S8-6) at m/z 111 (C8H15+), 97 (C7H13+), 83 (C6H11+), 69 (C5H9+), 55 (C4H7+), 44 (C3H8+), and 32 (CH3OH+is likely due
to adduct formation with methanol used as a reaction solvent). Yet
another minor feature at Rt = 9.6 min (Figure S8-7) predicted
to be a norbornadiene derivative with chemical composition C8H7Cl3 (M+ = 208) exhibiting mass
fragmentations at 206 (M+–2), 191 (C7H2Cl3), 91 (C7H7+), 44 (C3H8+), 40, and 32.
A partially dechlorinated product from ES leads to norbornadiene;
very low intensity highlights the fast decomposition of them as well
as fast dechlorination as a whole. A fragment observed at Rt = 10.7 min (Figure S8-8) is attributed to diethyl phthalate, as the observed
MS pattern is in good agreement with that.47

A feature observed at Rt = 17.15 min shows mass fragments at 307 (C9H6Cl5O), 207 (C8H6Cl3+), 44 (C2H4O+), and
32 (CH4O+) (Figure S8-9); from the above mentioned fragments, it has been predicted that
the parent chemical composition is C9H6Cl6O (M+ = 342), and it is likely to be ES–ether.
GC results show a peak at Rt = 17.4 min (Figures S8-10), and
the corresponding MS results show a typical MS pattern of ES–diol;
C9H8Cl6O2 with a molecular
mass of 360 with a probability of 84.7%. The corresponding mass values
appeared at m/z 325 (C9H8Cl5+O2), 307 (C9H4Cl5+), 277 (C8H8Cl3), 207 (C8H6Cl2O2+), 170 (C8H5ClO2+), 44 (C2H4O+), and 32 (CH4O+). Other unidentified
products (trace amounts) were also observed on GC–MS. The above
mentioned discussions are consistent with the UV–visible absorption
spectrum of degraded products; the observed peaks at 243 and 282 nm
correspond to π–π* and n−π* transitions
of benzene derivatives attached with heteroatoms such as −OH
or keto groups. From the GC–MS and UV–visible results,
it demonstrates that ES was degraded through ES–diol, ES–ether,
α-methylbenzyl alcohol, and acetophenone pathway; it was further
degraded into smaller fragments. Importantly, the above mentioned
observations highlight the visible light activity associated with
ZSx catalysts. Indeed, without a catalyst or in the
absence of light source, no ES degradation was observed. A semiquantitative
calculation from the GC chromatogram recorded before and after the
60 h irradiation demonstrates that, at least 80% ES was completely
mineralized to CO2 through various fragments. Some of the
corollary experiments carried out for complete degradation of acetophenone
or 2-phenyl-2-propanol with ZS4 (not shown) in sunlight occurs in
16–20 h with 50 ppm concentration.

ZnO–ZnS heterojunctions
present in ZSx is
the prime reason for the visible light absorption and better activity.
The heterojunctions observed between ZnS and ZnO nanocrystallites
help in electron–hole pair separation, and facile mobility
of charge carriers allows for better photocatalytic degradation of
ES. The porous structure and high surface area induce the photogenerated
carriers to diffuse fast to the surface and react rapidly with the
adsorbed molecules and hence an effective utilization of charge carriers
for the degradation of ES.

4 Conclusion
ZnO–ZnS (ZSx) composites with heterojunctions
between the constituent components were prepared by the SCM and characterized
by a variety of physicochemical, spectral, and microscopy measurements.
ZSx were indexed to the wurtzite structure; however,
with an increase in the thiourea amount, an increase in the ZnS content
was also observed. An important point to be noted is the increasing
crystallite size of ZnS with increasing thiourea content in the reactant
mixture. Heat treatment in air between 450 and 650 °C decreases
the ZnS crystallite size, offering a method to fine tune the particle
size. The present method of preparation and the tuning of the ZnS
crystallite size in the solid state are important, and it is not available
at present in the solid state. Further, high thermal stability of
the present materials makes them flexible for several applications,
including catalysis.

The porous structure with needle- or V-shaped
particles with significant
macropore contribution underscores its potential in sensing and catalysis
applications. Raman, SIMS, TG, and XRD studies demonstrate the direct
bonding between Zn and S as in typical ZnS. Optical absorption studies
demonstrate a significant decrease in the band gap down to 2.3 eV
for ZSx compared to wide band gap for parent materials
(ZnO–ZnS). The band gap diminution of ZSx has
been attributed to the formation of hybrid orbitals in the VB and
CB. It is expected that S 3p and O 2p are likely to overlap in the
VB of ZSx at and around interfaces and heterojunctions,
and the extent of overlap increases from ZS1 to ZS4. Sulphur exists
as an S2– anion in ZSx, and the top of the VB might
be predominantly composed of S 3p bands, as they have higher orbital
energies than O 2p levels. Thus, S 3p and O 2p bands overlap and broaden
the VB compared to ZnO or ZnS. The above mentioned studies affirm
the nature of ZSx with heterojunctions between ZnO
and ZnS and ZSx as a potential candidate for PV application.

Photocurrent generation under 1 sun condition and heterojunctions
observed between ZnO and ZnS demonstrates the effective sunlight absorption
and separation of charge carriers. Probably, this is the first report
to demonstrate photocurrent generation under 1 sun condition by combining
two wide band gap semiconductors into a composite with heterojunctions.
Photocatalytic activity studies of ZSx (for complete
mineralization of 2,4-DCP and ES ECDs in direct sunlight) demonstrate
its potential to develop efficient visible light active photocatalysts.
We also suggest that ZSx composites might offer a
possible solution to eradicate the EDC contamination in the large
amount of farm lands in many countries. A simple mixing of ZSx with the soil in the presence of water and sunlight would
mineralize EDC in about a month’s time, and it is very likely
to make the land cultivable again. However, systematic and thorough
pilot plant studies will be required to evaluate the feasibility of
this option. These applications are depicted pictorially in Figure 16.

Figure 16 Possible applications
with ZSx composites are
depicted. (Right) ES-/ECD-infested land could be made fertile again
and (left) possible to generate power. Both applications are with
direct sunlight.

5 Experimental
Section
5.1 Synthesis of ZnO–ZnS Composites
All chemicals employed were of analytical grade and used as such.
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Merck) as a zinc
precursor and urea and thiourea (Loba Chemie) as fuels were used.
SCM30 was adopted to make ZSx, which is a simple process that requires short time and a laboratory
furnace. In a typical synthesis procedure, an equimolar (0.04 mol)
amount Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and fuel,
(but with a different ratio of urea and thiourea, varied from 100%
urea to 100% thiourea) were taken in a 250 mL beaker with 10 mL of
distilled water.

After thorough solubilization of reactants,
the solution was introduced into a preheated furnace at 500 °C.
Water evaporation takes place for up to 2 min, followed by ignition
of the reactant mixture, yielding a yellow solid. With 100% urea,
brown-colored ZnO1–xNx was obtained.16 The solid
product was collected after the completion of the combustion process.
Urea/thiourea was varied from 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, and 25:75 to 0:100,
and the resulting materials are designated as Z1, ZS1, ZS2, ZS3, and
ZS4, respectively. All the above mentioned materials were thoroughly
characterized, and the characterization methods and instruments are
described in the Supporting Information (S1).
