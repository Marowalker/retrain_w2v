Sampling and extraction of chemical
residues present on flat or
curved surfaces as well as touch-sensitive objects are challenging.
Hydrogels are characterized by high mechanical flexibility and water
content. Thus, they are an ideal medium for transferring water-soluble
analytes from a sampled surface to the next stage of an analytical
workflow. Here, we demonstrate gel-phase microextraction (GPME), in
which disks of blended hydrogels are utilized to lift traces of water-soluble
substances adsorbed on surfaces. The protocol has been optimized in
a series of tests involving fluorometric and mass spectrometric measurements.
Compared with the pure agarose hydrogel, most of the tested blended
hydrogels provide a higher efficiency for the sampling/extraction
of a model analyte, fluorescein. The blended hydrogel disks are incorporated
into three-dimensional (3D)-printed acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene
chips to create easy-to-use sampling probes. We exemplify the suitability
of this improved GPME approach in sampling chemical residues present
on the skin, glass, and daily use objects. In these tests, the extracts
were analyzed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer fitted with
an electrospray ion source operated in the positive- and negative-ion
modes. The method enabled the detection of diclofenac on excised porcine
skin fragments exposed to a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug and sweat residues (lactic acid) left on surfaces touched by
humans. The limits of detection for diclofenac and lactic acid in
hydrogel extract were 6.4 × 10–6 and 2.1 ×
10–5 M, respectively. In a model experiment, conducted
using the presented approach, the amount of lactic acid on a glass
slide with fingerprints was estimated to be ∼1.4 × 10–7 mol cm–2.

Introduction
The early steps of
most analytical workflows entail sampling real
matrices, capturing the target analytes, concentrating the analytes
in small volumes, and transferring them to detection systems. Sampling
is one of the key steps that affect analytical workflows, and, in
some cases, it constitutes a major bottleneck in analytical methodology.1,2 The sampled matrices can be present in different phases and have
different shapes and aspect ratios. It is always necessary to obtain
a representative portion of the sampled matrix with minimum perturbation
to the sampled objects.3,4 Perturbation can be limited by
decreasing the size of the sampling tool as well as minimizing mechanical
and chemical stresses imposed on the sampled object.

Two popular
microsampling techniques are solid-phase microextraction5 and single-drop microextraction.6 They utilize thin fibers coated with polymers or hanging
liquid droplets to capture analytes from the liquid or gas phase.
It is yet challenging to collect trace amounts of analytes present
on soft, flat, and curved objects. Hydrogel is a biocompatible, hydrophilic,
and flexible material. For example, cross-linkable solutions of dextran-methacrylate
were used to form hydrogels for sampling amino acids and deoxyribonucleic
acid from fingerprints.7 In previous studies,
we implemented agarose hydrogel micropatches to collect low-molecular-weight
compounds (metabolites, drugs) from the human skin surface.8−11 The main component of sweat is water. Water-soluble compounds can
readily diffuse to a water-rich hydrogel matrix. However, that procedure
involving single-component hydrogel micropatches showed practical
limitations related to sampling efficiency and long-term storage of
hydrogel probes. The goals of the present study are to improve the
sampling efficiency, to verify the possibility of implementing various
hydrogels for sampling analytes adsorbed on various surfaces, to increase
the maximum storage time of the probes, and to demonstrate alternative
applications of the method. Mixing two kinds of polymers is a simple
way to produce a blended material with the advantages of both constituents.12−14 Therefore, in addition to other modifications to the analytical
procedure, here, we have combined agarose with other water-soluble
polymers. One of the proposed applications concerns about the profiling
retention of a topical drug component (diclofenac15,16) on the skin. The short sampling time with hydrogel allows one to
conduct repeated sampling of the same specimen and temporal profiling
of dynamic processes such as absorption of a topical drug by the skin.
Another application concerns about the detection of human activity
by detecting skin metabolites on surfaces. Lactic acid is among the
most abundant metabolites present in human sweat.10,17,18 Thus, in another application, we aimed to
detect lactic acid in fingerprints present on solid surfaces.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 presents
the workflow of this study on gel-phase microextraction (GPME), while
method details are provided in the Experimental Section below. For this study, we chose several hydrogel-forming polymers
that are relatively biocompatible. In fact, they are used in food-related,
pharmaceutical, or cosmetic products. Fluorescein was used as a model
analyte in the initial tests because it is soluble in water and has
low molecular weight. Hence, it can enter the pores within the hydrogel
matrix. It could also be quantified at low concentrations by fluorescence
spectrometry (FS). Analyses involving other compounds were conducted
by mass spectrometry (MS).

Optimization
of GPME Sampling
Initially, we performed
a number of tests, in which hydrogels with different compositions
were submerged in fluorescein solutions (loading) and the absorbed
fluorescein was subsequently re-extracted to a solvent mixture (extraction).
All of the results for fluorescein concentrations in the extract vs
loading and extraction times show similar ascending trends (Figure 2). The dependencies
exhibit plateaus for the loading times exceeding 20 min and extraction
times exceeding 30 min. At long loading times, the hydrogel matrix
is saturated with fluorescein and the system is equilibrated 1  At long extraction times, an equilibrium is
established between the hydrogel matrix and the extraction solvent 2  Moreover, various kinds of hydrogels exhibit
different characteristics of loading analytes to and extraction of
analytes from the hydrogel. Most of the blended hydrogels provide
higher Cmax,L and Cmax,E than the single-component agarose hydrogel, although
blended hydrogels generally provide lower kL and kE (Figure 2A,B and Table S1). These differences may be due to the different character of intermolecular
interactions such as Coulombic repulsion, hydrogen bonding, and polar
forces (cf. ref (19)), as well as pore structure. The optimal component ratio for poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP)–agarose hydrogel was 1.5:1.0 and for poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG)–agarose was 3.0:1.0, while for poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)–agarose
and sodium hyaluronate (HA)–agarose was 2.5:1.0 (Figure 2C).

values from three replicates. Data points in (C) are average values
from six replicates. Standard deviations are shown. Note that the
results for pure agarose (1 and 5%) in (A) and (B) are the same and
are displayed in every graph for comparison.

By comparing the mass spectra of blank extracts from different
hydrogel disks, we found out that complex spectral background related
to the PVP–agarose hydrogel appears in the m/z range from 800 to 2000, while the spectral background
related to the PEG–agarose and PVA–agarose hydrogels
is in the m/z range from 500 to
2000 (Figure S1). Thus, using the PVP–agarose
hydrogel, one can detect analytes in the m/z range from 20 to 800 with only minor spectral interference.
Although the HA–agarose hydrogel exhibits a lower spectral
background, the extracted fluorescein concentrations are much lower
in this hydrogel than in the other blended hydrogels (Figure 2C). Therefore, we chose PVP–agarose
hydrogel with the component ratio of 1.5:1.0 for further work. The
extraction efficiency of fluorescein from the PVP–agarose hydrogel
to the liquid phase was estimated to be ∼48%.

To ensure
convenient sampling of solid surfaces, the hydrogel disks
were incorporated into 3D-printed bases. Sealing the probes in plastic
packs and storing them at 4 °C (Figure S2A,B) efficiently minimize water evaporation from the hydrogel for at
least two weeks (Figure S2C).

Application
of GPME in Kinetic Analysis of Exogenous Residues
on the Skin
Characterizing retention of chemical compounds
on the skin is important for the development of topical drug and cosmetic
products (cf. refs (20−23)). To test retention kinetics
of such products, we applied selected commercial products to excised
porcine skin and analyzed their residues at different time points.
GPME probes were used to lift the target analytes adsorbed on and
absorbed by porcine skin periodically. The active ingredient of the
tested nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) gel is diclofenac
sodium. In the negative-ion mode electrospray ionization–mass
spectrometry (ESI–MS), diclofenac gives high signals at the m/z 294 and 296 (in addition to others),
revealing the characteristic isotope distribution of chlorine (Figure S3). Note that some of the signals are
likely related to the excipients present in the NSAID pharmaceutical
formulation. The intensity of diclofenac ion at the m/z 294 in the spectra obtained for GPME probes exposed
to the porcine skin decreased with incubation time (Figures 3A and S3). All of the other diclofenac-related ions also decreased
with time. However, they were still detectable after 24 h incubation.
This long retention of diclofenac on excised porcine skin is in line
with the literature discussing retention of diclofenac in humans.15,16 Most detectable species from the tested cosmetic products were rapidly
absorbed by the skin, in some cases, even within one hour (Figures 3B–D and S4; for blank datasets, see Figure S5). Absorption of specific ingredients is likely affected
by the polymers added to the cosmetics.24 Based on the decay rate constants (k), the analytes
displayed dissimilar absorption kinetics in the porcine skin (Table S2). This can be attributed to different
physicochemical properties of various compounds and the resulting
different affinities to the skin matrix (cf. ref (25)).

NSAID gel; (B) moisturizing cream; (C) Nashi blossom moisturizing

were analyzed by electrospray ionization–triple quadrupole
mass spectrometry (ESI–QQQ-MS) operated in the positive-ion
(+) and negative-ion (−) modes [Q3 scan, average from 1 min
extracted ion current (EIC)].

To evaluate quantitative capabilities of the described method,
we prepared a calibration plot for diclofenac (Table S3 and Figure S6A). Acetaminophen was used as an internal
standard, and blank hydrogel extract was used as the solvent to simulate
matrix effect. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification
(LOQ) for diclofenac in the hydrogel extract were 6.41 × 10–6 and 2.14 × 10–5 M, respectively
(3.62 × 10–10 and 1.21 × 10–9 mol, respectively). The amount of diclofenac on the porcine skin
was estimated to be (2.26 ± 0.42) × 10–7 mole cm–2 at the time point “0 min”
(assuming that the extraction efficiency from the hydrogel to the
liquid phase was 48%, assuming that the extraction efficiency from
the specimen surface to the hydrogel was 100%, and taking into account
that the contact area between the hydrogel and skin was 0.28 cm2). The recoveries of diclofenac from the extract of individual
hydrogel disks (exposed to the porcine skin smeared with the NSAID
gel) were found to be in the range of 121–182%. The excipient
ingredients in the NSAID gel are most likely responsible for the observed
matrix effect.

In a recently disclosed sampling approach, a
polymer-based blotting
paper is used to lift topical residues from the skin prior to gas
chromatographic analysis.26 The advantage
of using GPME and direct infusion MS for analysis of topical residues
is that nonvolatile species can readily be detected.

Imaging Transfer
of the Analyte from the Sampled Surface to
the Hydrogel Disk
To further investigate the kinetics of
GPME sampling, the NSAID gel was spiked with fluorescein (final concentration,
10–3 M). The mixture (0.1 g) was spread onto the
porcine skin fragment (∼9 cm2). PVP–agarose
(1:5:1.0) hydrogel disks (without the base) were affixed onto the
porcine skin. The disks were removed periodically, placed under stereomicroscope,
and cut in half using a sharp metal blade. During the exposure of
the hydrogel disks to the porcine skin, fluorescein molecules diffused
into the hydrogel matrix. A band of these fluorescent species is clearly
visible near the edge of the hydrogel that contacted the skin surface
(Figure 4A). The G
values for pixels situated along six lines perpendicular to the disk
edge were averaged, the obtained pixel intensity versus distance profiles
were smoothed by the Savitzky–Golay algorithm (Figure 4B), and the areas under the
curves (AUCs) were computed (Figure 4C). The relation between AUC and sampling time (t, in minutes) is described by the equation 3  It is striking
that, after 50 min exposure
of hydrogel disks to the porcine skin, the absorbed fluorescein was
evenly distributed within the hydrogel matrix. However, it should
be noted that this sampling/extraction time was longer than the loading
time selected based on the previous experiments (Figure 2; with hydrogel disks submerged
in the solvent, in the presence of shaking). It is understandable
that molecular transport between the solution within the hydrogel
matrix and the external environment is faster if the hydrogel disk
is surrounded by the solvent. Nevertheless, to expedite the sampling
process, the loading/sampling time in the following experiments was
set to 20 min.

Application of GPME in the Analysis of Residues Present on Solid
Surfaces
A potentially interesting application of GPME is
tracing human skin metabolites present on surfaces with fingerprints.
Every time we touch a surface, we leave small amounts of endogeneous
and exogenous compounds.27 We have applied
the developed GPME probes to collect traces of molecules from the
daily use objects such as computer keyboard, mouse, and laboratory
bench. Subsequently, we implemented MS to analyze the resulting extracts
from hydrogel disks. The results show that it is possible to detect
various chemical species present on those target surfaces (Figure 5). The blank result
was prepared from a clean glass slide, sampled by the GPME probe,
and displayed as sample number 1. In one experiment, three volunteers
were asked to deposit fingerprints on clean glass slides for 5 min
and the fingerprints were sampled by GPME probes (sample numbers 2,
3, and 4). For example, the MS signals at the m/z 89, 171, and 247 were higher in the control and real sample
than in the blank. The signal at the m/z 89 was identified as lactic acid (for product ion scans, see Figure S7). The same signal appeared in the samples
obtained from daily use items, such as bench and computer peripherals.
While identification of other signals related to the species lifted
from solid surfaces by GPME is out of scope of this study, in principle,
such untargeted analysis could be carried out with the aid of a high-resolution
mass spectrometer.

Legend: black, m/z 89 (−);

by ESI–QQQ-MS operated in the positive- and negative-ion modes
(Q3 scan, average from 1 min EIC; n = 3; error bars
represent standard deviation).

Because the extracts of hydrogel disks that were in contact with
daily use objects do not contain a complex matrix (low matrix effect
in ESI–MS), the recoveries for lactic acid were in an acceptable
range (106–118%; Table S3 and Figure S6B). Thus, in some cases, the method could be applied for quantitative
determinations. For that purpose, we prepared a calibration plot for
lactic acid (Table S3 and Figure S6B).
Threonine was used as an internal standard, and blank hydrogel extract
was used as the solvent to simulate the matrix effect. The LOD and
LOQ for lactic acid in the hydrogel extract were 2.10 × 10–5 and 7.00 × 10–5 M, respectively
(1.19 × 10–9 and 3.96 × 10–9 mol, respectively). The amount of lactic acid on the glass slide
with fingerprints was estimated to be (1.43 ± 0.08) × 10–7 mol cm–2 (assuming that the extraction
efficiency from the hydrogel to the liquid phase was 48%, assuming
that the extraction efficiency from the specimen surface to the hydrogel
was 100%, and taking into account that the contact area between the
hydrogel and skin was 0.28 cm2). Note that the properties
of the support of the sampled analytes (surface hydrophilicity) should
affect the sampling efficiency. However, the anticipated application
of this method variant is in qualitative and semiquantitative analyses,
for example, to confirm human activity in a certain area revealed
by residues of skin excretions (here, lactic acid) left by humans
on daily use objects.

Conclusions
This study presents
the use of blended hydrogel as a medium to
transfer the water-soluble analytes from the target surface to the
detection step. The composition of the hydrogel matrix has been optimized
in a series of experiments. The PVP–agarose hydrogel with the
component ratio of 1.5:1.0 provided better loading efficiency than
other tested hydrogels. By incorporating hydrogel disks into a 3D-printed
base, one can easily produce a tool (GPME probe) for sampling water-soluble
analytes from various surfaces. The GPME technique can be utilized
to study the retention kinetics of drug/cosmetics on porcine skin.
It can also be used to sample chemical residues left by humans on
furniture and appliances. In perspective, this noninvasive sampling
method may also be applied for collecting clinical and veterinary
specimens containing skin excretions, topical drug residues, or toxic
compounds adsorbed on foodstuffs. Taking into account the rapid progress
in automation of MS,28 and the requirement
for fast sample processing and analysis, it is appealing to combine
the proposed GPME technique with automated MS workflows.

Preparation of Blended
Hydrogel Disks
The blended hydrogel
disks were prepared with five kinds of polymers: PVP, PEG, PVA, HA,
and pure agarose. The binary mixture solution was prepared by dissolving
agarose and another polymer in water. The weight percentage of agarose
in the hydrogel was in the range from 1.2 to 2.4 wt %, and the concentration
of another added water-soluble polymer was from 2.4 to 3.6 wt %. The
total polymer percentage in the aqueous solution was fixed at 4.8
wt % (following ref (13)). The mixture was gradually heated to ∼90 °C in a water
bath to facilitate dissolution of the polymers. During this process,
the appearance of the mixture changed from turbid to transparent.
Subsequently, 4 mL of the solution was pipetted into a glass Petri
dish (⌀ = 5 cm) and it was let to cool down to room temperature
(∼22 ± 3 °C). After ∼10 min, the sol phase
underwent transition to the gel phase. A glass tube (I.D., 0.6 cm)
was used to cut disks out of the hydrogel mass (⌀ = 0.6 cm, h = 0.2 cm) (Figure 1A). In the application-oriented experiments, the hydrogel
disks (2 or 3) were embedded in a miniature holder (⌀ = 0.6
cm, h = 0.2 cm), fabricated by a 3D printer (UP Plus
2; Tiertime Technology, Beijing, China) with an acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene
polymer filament, to produce GPME probes for sampling solid matrices
(Figure S8). The blended hydrogels were
inserted into the probe base. The probes were covered with glass slides
(18 × 18 mm2), packed in low-density poly(ethylene)
bags with the aid of a vacuum sealer (FM2000; Foodsaver, Oklahoma
City, OK), and refrigerated at 4 °C (Figure S2A).

Extraction Protocol
In the early
experiments, individual
hydrogel disks were incubated in 10–5 M fluorescein
solution in 10 vol % ethanol (Figure 1B). In the later experiments, involving mass spectrometric
detection (Figure 1C), the following solid objects were sampled: porcine skin, glass
slides with fresh fingerprints, laboratory bench surface, computer
keyboard, and mouse (Figure 1D,E). An exposed hydrogel disk was transferred into a 1.5
mL microcentrifuge tube by tweezers. An aliquot of the extraction
solvent was pipetted into the tube to re-extract the hydrogel disk.
The extraction solvent was 20 mM ammonium acetate in 10 vol % ethanol
in the case of FS and 20 mM ammonium acetate in 50 vol % ethanol in
the case of MS. The volumes of the extraction solvent were 1 mL for
FS and 0.5 mL for MS. To improve the re-extraction efficiency, the
tube was placed in a thermoshaker (ThermoMixer C; Eppendorf, Hamburg,
Germany) set to 37 °C and 300 rpm. Moreover, in the case of FS,
the extracts were diluted 3× with 20 mM ammonium acetate (in
10 vol % ethanol) to fill up the standard quartz cuvette (optical
path length, 10 mm).

Freshly excised porcine skin was obtained
from a local morning market (acquired from a slaughterhouse on the
same day; Hsinchu, Taiwan). It was rinsed with tap water for 5 min,
then deionized water for 5 min, and subsequently cut into smaller
fragments of ∼9 cm2 using scissors. The porcine
skin fragments were stored at −80 °C and used for experiments
during 7 days. Immediately before every experiment, the skin fragments
were cleaned again in deionized water and wiped with cellulose tissue
soaked in 70 vol % ethanol. The fragments were then placed on the
top of a 0.5 wt % agarose hydrogel layer in a glass Petri dish and
incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The purpose of the agarose hydrogel
layer under the skin was to assure skin hydration during the experiment
(Figure 1D). The temperature
of 30 °C was chosen because it is close to the average human
skin temperature.29 We applied 0.1 g of
a selected pharmaceutical or cosmetic product onto the surface of
porcine skin and spread it uniformly with a plastic spoon. The porcine
skin was repeatedly sampled with GPME probes for 20 min at different
time points following application of the product. Hydrogel disks were
transferred from the probes to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes by tweezers,
and 0.5 mL of extraction solvent was pipetted into the tubes. The
tubes were then placed in a thermoshaker (ThermoMixer C) set to 37
°C and 300 rpm for 30 min to re-extract analytes from the hydrogel
disks. The consecutive samplings were performed on different (previously
unsampled) skin areas to avoid the influence of analyte depletion
on the result.

Fluorescence Spectrometry
The extracts
containing fluorescein
were analyzed by means of the LS55 fluorescence spectrometer from
PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA) using FL WinLab (version 4.00, PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA). The excitation wavelength was 405 nm (slit, 10 nm).
The emitted light was scanned from 470 to 650 nm (slit, 10 nm). The
scan speed was 180 nm min–1. The final values were
average emission intensities for the wavelengths from 506 to 516 nm.
Fluorescein concentrations in the extracts were determined by building
calibration plots for six concentration levels, always on the same
day. The coefficients of determination (R2) for these calibration plots ranged from 0.992 to 0.999.

Mass Spectrometry
The extracts of complex matrices
were analyzed by means of an LCMS-8030 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
(Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) using LabSolutions software (version 5.82).
The electrospray ionization (ESI) interface was operated with a syringe
pump (Legato Nano; KD Scientific, Holliston, MA) infusing the sample
at a flow rate of 30 μL min–1. The nebulizing
gas (nitrogen) flow rate was 2 L min–1, while the
drying gas (nitrogen) flow rate was 15 L min–1.
The desolvation line temperature was 250 °C, while the heating
block temperature was 400 °C. The voltages of the ESI needle
were +4.5 and −3.5 kV in the positive- and negative-ion modes,
respectively. Depending on the experiment, the instrument was operated
in Q3 scan (m/z range, 20–2000),
product ion scan, or multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. In the
case of product ion scan and MRM modes, different collision energies
were tested: −10, −20, and −30 V for positive
ions and 10, 20, and 30 V for negative ions. MRM transitions: 294.00
→ 250.00 for diclofenac, 152.00 → 110.00 for acetaminophen,
89.00 → 43.00 for lactic acid, 120.00 → 74.00 for threonine.
Instrumental blank signals were recorded for ∼2 min, followed
by recording sample signals for ∼2 min. The extracted ion currents
were obtained for 1 unit intervals in the m/z scale. The final values correspond to the average of extracted
ion currents from 1 min recording.

Imaging Diffusion of Fluorescein
in Hydrogel Disks
RGB images of the hydrogel disk cross-sectional
area were viewed
under a stereomicroscope (SMZ745T; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a 2×
objective and a 10× eyepiece. A blue light-emitting diode (wavelength
range: 410–500 nm), positioned at an angle of 60° and
at a height of 1.5 cm, was used for excitation. The microscope objective
was covered with three layers of a dark yellow-green filter (Lee Filters
lighting gel sheet 090, wavelength range 460–590 nm; Knight
Sound & Lighting, Cuyahoga Falls, OH). The exposure time and ISO
value set in the digital camera (EM-1, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) were
2.5 s and 100, respectively.

Collection of Fingerprint Residues
Three volunteers
were asked to deposit their fingerprints by pressing fingertips on
clean glass slides for 5 min. Note that the surface of this glass
is hydrophilic (contact angle for water, 76°). In other tests,
residues from various solid surfaces (bench, computer peripherals)
were sampled. GPME probes were placed on the sampled surface for 20
min. Then, hydrogel disks were transferred from the probes to 1.5
mL microcentrifuge tubes by tweezers and 0.5 mL of extraction solvent
was pipetted into the tubes. The tubes were placed in a thermoshaker
(ThermoMixer C) set to 37 °C and 300 rpm for 30 min to re-extract
analytes from the hydrogel disks.

Data Treatment
The experimental datasets were processed
using OriginPro 8 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). The FS datasets
were fitted with exponential functions to determine rate constants
(min–1) of loading (kL) and extraction (kE) 4   5  where CL and CE are the experimentally
determined concentrations
of fluorescein in the final extracts (moles per liter), Cmax,L and Cmax,E are the maximum
concentrations of fluorescein for loading and extraction datasets
(moles per liter), respectively, and t is the time
(min).

In an experiment designed to study retention kinetics
of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products on porcine skin, the MS datasets
were fitted with the equation 6  where I is the ion
intensity
recorded by MS (Q3 scan, average of extracted ion current (EIC) from
1 min), I0 is the ion intensity extrapolated
to t = 0 h, k is the decay rate
constant (h–1), t is the time (h),
and b is the analysis baseline.
