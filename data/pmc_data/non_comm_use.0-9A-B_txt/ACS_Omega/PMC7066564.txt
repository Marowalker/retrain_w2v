The pH/redox dual-sensitive fluorescent
carbon dots (pHRCDs) with
the fluorescence quantum yield of 16.97% were synthesized by the pyrolysis
of l-glutamic acid
(l-glu) and dopamine (DA). Compared with the quantum dot
(QD)–dopamine conjugate, when the pH value of the solution
was changed from neutral to alkaline, the pHRCDs exhibited unique
optical phenomenon including red-shift of fluorescence peak and the
fluorescence intensity first decreasing from pH 7 to 10 and then increasing
from pH 10 to 13. The pHRCDs could be developed for a discriminative
and highly sensitive dual-response fluorescent probe for the detection
of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and ascorbic acid (AA) activity in
human blood. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the dual-response
fluorescent probe can detect GSSG and AA in the linear range of 1.2–3.6
and 27–35 μM with the detection limits of 0.1 and 3.1
μM, respectively. In addition, the pHRCDs demonstrated low cytotoxicity
and good biocompatibility, which can be well applied to in vitro cell
imaging, and the pHRCDs/GSH fluorescence system has been successfully
developed for the detection of AA in real samples.

Introduction
Biologically active
molecules such as ascorbic acid (AA) and oxidized
glutathione (GSSG) coexist in the serum and central nervous system
and play a crucial role in human metabolic processes.1,2 Glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide formed by cysteine, glutamic acid,
and glycine, is the most important tripeptide thiol found in the human
cell system and can be readily oxidized into its dimeric form in response
to oxidative stress within cells.3,4 The high concentration
of GSSG is associated with asthma, human immunodeficiency virus type
1 infection, and chronicle renal failure.5 Therefore, the change in GSH/GSSG ratio has become a key biomarker
in monitoring the overall health of the cells and their resistance
to oxidative damage. Ascorbic acid, a natural antioxidant, is one
of the most important neuromodulators in the central nervous system.6 It is often present in the entire physiological
system as an anion and plays a key role in various physiological/pathological
processes. Because of its reducing property, AA can remove free radicals
generated by endogeneity and prevent cellular damage induced by free
radicals and provide protection against diseases that involve oxidative
stress, such as enzymatic reactions, ischemic stroke, immune system
enhancement, olfactory dysfunctions, and so forth.7,8 Considering
the important roles of GSSG and AA in our daily life, it is critical
to determine the concentration of GSSG and AA in the body.

In
the past decades, many valuable methods such as colorimetry,9−11 electrochemical methods,12 liquid chromatography,13,14 mass spectrometry,15 and fluorescence
methods16,17 have been successfully developed for the
detection of GSSG and AA. For example, Zhang and co-workers designed
a method for detecting intracellular nitroxyl and GSH–GSSG
based on double-site fluorescent probe NCF.16 Shan and co-workers demonstrated the detection of cadmium(II) ions
and AA based on dumbbell-shaped CQDs/AuNCs nanomixtures as an effective
ratio of fluorescent probes.17 However,
most of these methods show some limitations, such as complicated processing,
high cost of instruments, and time-consuming operations.18 Carbon dots (CDs), as a new type of emerging
materials, are superior to the traditional semiconductor quantum dots
because of their excellent optical properties, such as biocompatibility,
anti-photodegradation, and low toxicity,19,20 and have been used in various applications such as in vitro and
in vivo imaging,21,22 disease diagnosis,23 drug carrier,24,25 fluorescent
probe,26 and so on.

Herein, a simple,
rapid, and environmentally friendly preparation
route was designed to prepare pHRCDs using DA and l-glu as
raw materials, wherein l-glu is taken as a carbon source
and DA provides catechol hydroxyl functional groups for pHRCDs to
achieve pH/redox dual-sensitive properties. As shown in Scheme 1, in the presence of GSSG,
catechol on the surface of pHRCDs could be oxidized by GSSG, and simultaneously
generated GSH was grafted onto the surface of nonoxidized pHRCDs by
the Michael addition reaction, which can significantly lead to fluorescence
intensity enhancement of pHRCDs and appearance of a new fluorescence
peak. When AA was added into the system, it was found that the fluorescence
intensity of the pHRCDs/GSH fluorescence system gradually decreased
with the increase of AA content, which may be due to the Maillard
reaction between AA and GSH to produce various aromatic compounds,
resulting in the fluorescence quenching of the pHRCDs/GSH fluorescence
system. The above-mentioned results demonstrate that the pHRCDs/GSH
fluorescence system possesses resplendent potential for application
in the detection of AA in real samples.

and pHRCDs/GSH Fluorescence System
Experimental
Section
Materials
l-Glutamic acid (l-glu), l-histidine (l-his), l-phenylalanine (l-phe), l-leucine (l-leu), and l-tryptophan
(l-try) were purchased from Tianjin Institute of Fine Chemical
for Guangfu (Tianjin, China). AA and Tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane
(Tris) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. Oxidized glutathione
(GSSG) was purchased from Shanghai Shifeng Biotechnology Co., Ltd
(Shanghai, China). Dopamine (DA) hydrochloride, phenethylamine, and
glutathione (GSH) were purchased from Adamas Co., Ltd. Dialysis membrane
(MWCO 500 Da) was purchased from Shanghai Sanggong Biotechnology Co.,
Ltd (Shanghai, China). Unless stated otherwise, all the chemical and
biological reagents were procured from commercial sources and used
without further purification.

Instruments
The
morphology of pHRCDs was investigated
using a JEM-2100Plus transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 200
kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded by
an ESCALAB 250 surface analysis system. Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Optics VERTEX 70 spectrometer.
The fluorescence and absorption spectra were measured with an F-7000
fluorescence spectrophotometer and a UV-9100A spectrometer, respectively.
Also, all pH measurements were obtained by a PHS-3W pH meter.

Preparation
of pHRCDs
l-Glu (0.09 g) and DA
hydrochloride (0.12 g) were added to a 50 mL three-necked flask, respectively.
First, by heating to 230 °C under reflux for 15 min and then
cooling to the room temperature, dark brown solid was obtained. Then,
10.0 mL of distilled water was added to the three-necked flask for
ultrasonic treatment for 10 min and then the solution was magnetically
stirred for 3 h. It is observed that the reaction mixture turned into
a reddish-brown solution with black precipitation at the bottom, which
is further centrifuged at 16 000 rpm for 20 min. Also, the
clarified reddish-brown supernatant was collected and dialyzed against
Millipore water (18.2 MΩ cm) via the dialysis membrane (MWCO
500). Finally, the resulting solution was stored at 4 °C for
subsequent experiments.

Detection of GSSG by pHRCDs
For
GSSG detection, different
amounts of GSSG were added in a series of 1.5 mL of a solution containing
20 μL of pHRCDs and 1480 μL of Tris-HCl (10 mM, pH 7.0).
Then, the solution was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The fluorescence
spectra were recorded between 350 and 700 nm wavelength range at the
excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The slit width of emission and excitation
were set at 5 and 10 nm, respectively.

Detection of AA by pHRCDs/GSH
Fluorescence System
For
the assay of AA, different amounts of AA were added in a series of
1.5 mL of a solution containing 20 μL of pHRCDs, 1412 μL
of Tris-HCl (10 mM, pH 7), and 68 μL of (0.1 mol/L) GSSG. Then,
the solution was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The fluorescence
spectra were recorded between 350 and 700 nm wavelength range at the
excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The slit widths of emission and excitation
were set at 5 and 10 nm, respectively.

Real Sample Assay
Aliquots of 100-fold diluted human
serum with Tris-HCl (10 mM, pH 7.0) were mixed with 68 μL (0.1
mol/L) of GSSG and 20 μL of pHRCDs was added, Subsequently,
different contents of AA were sequentially added to the above centrifugation
tubes and diluted to 1.5 mL with Tris-HCl (10 mM, pH 7.0). Then, the
mixtures were cultured in a constant temperature incubator at 25 °C
for 10 min. Finally, the fluorescence spectra were collected at an
excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The slit width of emission and excitation
were set at 5 and 10 nm, respectively.

Cell Cytotoxicity of pHRCDs
Hela cells were inoculated
into 96-well plates and cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
Subsequently, different concentrations of pHRCDs (0–1000 μg/mL)
were added to each well for 48 h and then 50 μL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) solution (1 mg/mL) was added to each well for 4 h. The
supernatant was removed and 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
was added to each well for 10 min. Finally, the absorbance was measured
using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules) at 490 nm.

Cell Imaging
To observe the influence of pHRCDs on
cell imaging, Hela cells were inoculated on six-well plates and cultured
under 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 h. Next, different concentrations
of pHRCDs (100 and 500 μg/mL) were added to each well. After
incubation for 4 h, the supernatant was removed by washing the cells
with PBS and then adding 4% polyformaldehyde. Fluorescent images of
living cells were acquired on an inverted fluorescence microscope
(Leica DMI8, Germany).

Results and Discussion
Characterization of pHRCDs
The pHRCDs were prepared
by high-temperature pyrolysis using l-glu and DA hydrochloride
as raw material. The morphology and size of pHRCDs were characterized
by means of TEM. As can be seen in Figure 1A and the inset, the average diameter of
spherical particles was calculated to be 6.45 nm, with the relative
narrow size distribution ranging from 5 to 9.5 nm, and lattice fringes
with a spacing of 0.21 nm were clearly observed from the HRTEM image
(Figure 1B), which
are ascribed to the (100) diffraction facets of graphite.27

pHRCDs.
(B) HRTEM image of pHRCDs.

The chemical structure information of pHRCDs was known from the
FT-IR spectra. Compared with the FT-IR spectra of pure l-glu,
the pHRCDs exhibit strong broad-band absorption at 1687 cm–1 (stretching vibration of C=O) (Figure S1), which is the characteristic performance of dehydration
and carbonization. We further performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements to determine the doping content and chemical state
of nitrogen and oxygen in the pHRCDs. The full XPS spectrum presented
in Figure 2A shows
three typical peaks: C 1s (283.6 eV), N 1s (401.6 eV), and O 1s (532.3
eV) giving contents of 67.02 atom % (C), 10.96 atom % (N), and 22.02
atom % (O), respectively. The N/C and O/C atomic ratios are 16.35
and 32.86%, respectively, indicating that the pHRCDs were highly doped
with N and O. In the high-resolution C 1s spectrum (Figure 2B), the band can be deconvoluted
into three peaks, corresponding to C–C/C=C (284.55 eV),
C–N (285.64 eV), and C–OH (288.12 eV). The N 1s band
can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 399.91 and 401.25 eV, representing
pyrrole N (54.08 atom %) and graphitic N (45.92 atom %), respectively
(Figure 2C). The O
1s band can be deconvolved into a peak at 531.9 eV, representing C–OH
(Figure 2D). The emission
peak of pHRCDs was red-shifted with the increase of excitation wavelength
in the range of 320–410 nm. The pHRCDs exhibit obvious excitation-dependent
fluorescence emission behavior, which was the hallmark nature of CDs.28 The strongest emission peak was obtained at
350 nm excitation wavelength (Figure S2).

Mechanism of Fluorescence
Color Change of pHRCDs
Because
DA is usually characterized by two inherent redox properties: a Nernstian
dependence of formal potential on pH and oxidation of hydroquinone
to quinone by O2 at basic pH, the synthesized CDs using
DA as a raw material have usually pH-sensitive properties.29,30 It has been reported that QD–dopamine conjugates exhibit
pH-dependent quenching of photoluminescence,31 which can be used as a pH sensor to detect changes in cytoplasmic
pH when cells underwent drug-induced alkalosis. Hence, according to
these previous reports, we infer that the pHRCDs would possess similar
pH-dependent characteristics induced by redox reactions on DA.

We first studied the influence of pH of the medium on the fluorescence
of pHRCDs in the open air. As shown in Figure S3, the color of pHRCDs solutions gradually change from colorless
transparent to yellow under sunlight (up), and under irradiation of
a UV lamp, the pHRCDs show a unique first blue-shifted and subsequently
red-shifted optical phenomenon with increasing pH (down). It is further
verified by their fluorescence spectra, as shown in Figure 3A, that the fluorescence emission
peak first blue-shifted and subsequently red-shifted with the increase
of pH value, which exhibited the pH-dependence of the pHRCDs over
the pH range 1–10, consistent with the pH-dependence of QD–dopamine
conjugates.31,32 A slight difference is that the
fluorescence intensity gradually increased when the pH exceeds 10,
and no fluorescence quenching occurs under strong alkali conditions
(Figure 3B). To explore
the fluorescence conversion mechanism, CoOOH nanosheets were used
as an oxidant to study the fluorescence changes of pHRCDs solutions.
It is found that with the increase of the CoOOH content, the fluorescence
intensity of pHRCDs gradually decreases and fluorescence quenching
occurs. The main reason is that CoOOH oxidizes catechol hydroxyl on
the surface of pHRCDs to o-quinone, resulting in
fluorescence quenching of pHRCDs (Figure S4).33 However, the CDs synthesized by phenethylamine
and l-glu have no pH dependence (Figure S5), and the fluorescence color has no blue-shifted or red-shifted
phenomenon with the change of pH of the medium (Figure S6).

between
the fluorescence intensity of pHRCDs and pH value. (C) Absorption
spectra of pHRCDs (inset: photographs of pHRCDs at different pH values
under visible (up) and UV light (down)). (D) FT-IR spectra of pHRCDs.

At the same time, by analyzing the UV–vis
absorption spectrum
as shown in Figure 3C, four distinct absorption peaks at 223, 246, 278, and 342 nm may
be attributed to the n−π* transition of sp2 aromatic conjugate domains, the n−π conjugation on
phenol, the π–π conjugation on benzene ring, and
the n−π* broadened absorption bands of C=O transitions
at pH 3,34,35 respectively. However, when the pH increased
to 12, the p−π conjugation on phenol and the π–π
conjugation on the benzene ring disappeared and a new absorption peak
appeared at 256 nm. It may be due to the decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) generated by oxygen at a strongly
alkaline, resulting in the production of a large number of hydroxyl
radicals (•OH), which can cause oxidative o-quinone cleavage (Figure 4).30,36 The composition and structure
of the pHRCDs at different pH values were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy.
As shown in Figure 3D, the carboxyl group was clearly recognized through the very broad
O–H stretching absorption at 3408 cm–1 and
the C=O stretching vibration at 1672 cm–1, the characteristic peak of the benzene ring disappears when the
pH value is 12, which further verifies the formation mechanism of
carboxyl groups produced by the oxidative pyrolysis of o-quinone. Also, compared with the CDs synthesized using phenethylamine
and l-glu as raw materials, it was found that the UV–vis
absorption peak (Figure S7) and FT-IR spectrum
(Figure S8) of the CDs did not change with
the change of the pH value.

Figure 4 Conversion mechanism of the change of the pH
value leading to the
change of the fluorescence color of the pHRCDs.

Optimization of Experimental Condition
To optimize
the detection conditions for GSSG and AA, we studied the effects of
incubation time, pH, and temperature on the fluorescence intensity
of pHRCDs. As shown in Figure 3B, when the pH was less than 7.0, the fluorescence intensity
of pHRCDs gradually increased with the increase of pH. However, when
the pH was between 7.0 and 10, the fluorescence intensity decreased
linearly with the increase of pH. Therefore, pH 7.0 of the Tris-HCl
buffer solution was used as the optimal experimental condition. The
optimum quenching efficiency is 35.8% at 25 °C. Therefore, 25
°C was chosen as the best experimental condition for the pHRCDs/GSH
fluorescence system (Figure S9). Moreover,
the CDs have good optical stability (Figures S10 and S11).

Based on the above optimization, the effects
of different biomolecules on the fluorescence intensity of pHRCDs
were studied. Figure S12 shows the relationship
between different biomolecules and fluorescence intensity of pHRCDs.
It was found that AA had little effect on the fluorescence intensity
of pHRCDs, and the fluorescence efficiencies of GSSG and GSH were
21.1 and 8.96%, respectively. However, the fluorescence quenching
efficiencies of the simultaneous detection of AA/GSSG and AA/GSH were
13.4 and 21.2%, respectively. Therefore, it can be used to detect
the content of GSSG and AA by fluorescence change.

Detection of
GSSG by pHRCDs
Under the above-mentioned
optimal conditions, the sensing performance of the pHRCDs system to
GSSG was studied. As shown in Figure 5A, at 350 nm excitation wavelength, the emission peak
of pHRCDs at 430 nm was gradually enhanced, and simultaneously a new
emission peak appeared at 504 nm with the addition of GSSG. The dual-emission
fluorescence intensity was gradually enhanced with the increase of
GSSG concentration. As seen from the inset of Figure 5A, the fluorescent color changes from cyan
to green with the increase of the GSSG content, and the inset of Figure 5B shows that there
was a good linear relationship between ΔF (ΔF = F – F0, F and F0 were the
fluorescence intensities of the sensing system in the presence and
absence of GSSG, respectively) and the concentration of GSSG was in
the range of 1.2–3.6 μM (the equation is y = 74.5032C – 54.0337, R2 = 0.9968) with a detection limit of 0.1 μM. Figure 5C illustration also
shows a good linear relation in the range of 0–4 μM (the
equation is y = 89.9290C + 7.6808, R2 = 0.9972), with a detection limit of 50 nM.
The detection limit was based on the equation LOD = 3σ/s, where σ is the standard deviation of the corrected
blank signals of the pHRCDs and s is the slope of
the calibration curve. Therefore, the pHRCDs can perform a dual-response
detection of GSSG in the range of 1.2–3.6 μM, with a
detection limit of 0.1 μM. Compared with the detection methods
of GSSG reported in different literatures (Table S1), these results show that the pHRCDs have great potential
as a highly sensitive platform for GSSG sensing. It can be seen that
the pHRCDs have better selectivity, as shown in Figure S13. In addition, AA was added to the pHRCDs/GSH fluorescence
sensing system, which showed obvious fluorescence quenching. Therefore,
the pHRCDs/GSH fluorescence sensing system can be further applied
to the detection of AA.

μM. Inset: a linear correlation of ΔF value versus the concentration of GSSG over the range from 0 to

Detection of AA by pHRCDs/GSH Fluorescence System
Under
optimal conditions, the sensing performance of the pHRCDs/GSH fluorescence
system against AA was studied. As shown in Figure 6A, the fluorescence intensity of the pHRCDs/GSH
fluorescence system gradually decreased with the increase of AA concentration,
and it can be seen from the inset of Figure 6A that the fluorescence color quenched with
the increase of the AA content. The main reason may be the Maillard
reaction between AA and GSH in solution, which produces a variety
of aromatic compounds and quenches the fluorescence of the pHRCDs/GSH
fluorescence system.37 Also, Figure 6B inset shows that there was
a good linear relationship between ΔF (ΔF = F0 – F, F0 and F are the fluorescence
intensities of the sensing system in the absence and presence of AA,
respectively) and the concentration of AA was in the range of 27–47
μM (the equation is y = 3.3686C + 223.1288, R2 = 0.9955) with a detection
limit of 3.1 μM, and Figure 6C also shows a good linear range of 12–35 μM
(the equation is y = 6.5971C + 150.7681, R2 = 0.9926), with a detection limit of 0.51
μM. Therefore, the pHRCDs/GSH fluorescent probe can perform
a dual-response detection of AA in the range of 27–35 μM,
with a detection limit of 3.1 μM. Compared with the detection
methods of AA reported in different literatures (Table S2), these results show that the pHRCDs/GSH fluorescence
system has great potential as a highly sensitive platform for AA sensing.

intensity against AA concentration within the range of 0–69
μM. Inset: a linear correlation of ΔF value versus the concentration of AA over the range from 12 to 35

Selectivity Study
The selectivity of the developed
pHRCDs/GSH fluorescent system was evaluated prior to the actual testing
in serum. In detail, two times of different biomolecules, including
GSH, AA, l-his, l-phe, l-val, l-leu, and l-try, were added to the pHRCDs/GSH fluorescent
system, respectively. Also, fluorescence intensity ratios (ΔF/F0) of pHRCDs at 350 nm were
recorded in the presence of different biomolecules. From Figure 7, it can be seen
that the fluorescence intensity of the pHRCDs/GSH fluorescent system
does not show an obvious change with the introduction of various interfering
biomolecules. Furthermore, the response of the pHRCDs/GSH fluorescent
system to AA was not disturbed by all of the interference. Only AA
exhibits a noticeable response, indicating that pHRCDs/GSH have good
selectivity to AA.

the presence
of other interference.

Detection of AA in Serum
To evaluate the practicability
of the process of detecting AA, the concentration of AA in bovine
serum was detected. Based on the comparison between the results of
three repeated tests and the content of AA added, as shown in Table 1, the recovery rate
of the sample was between 97.8 and 103.7%, and the relative standard
deviation is between 1.1 and 4.5%. The results in Table 1 show that the detection method
has good reliability, accuracy, and repeatability, indicating that
the pHRCDs/GSH sensing system has great application potential. The
results in Table S1 show that the detection
method has good reliability, accuracy, and repeatability, indicating
that the pHRCDs/GSH sensing system has great application potential.

In Vitro Imaging Using pHRCDs
To
study the cytotoxicity
of pHRCDs on living cells, Hela cells were selected as a simulation
system for detecting pHRCDs. By detecting the cell survival rate at
different concentrations of pHRCDs, it was found that the cell survival
rate was over 90% when the concentration of pHRCDs is as high as 1000
μg/mL (Figure S14). The higher cell
survival rate proved that pHRCDs had low toxicity and significant
biocompatibility. Then, the fluorescence of Hela cells at different
concentrations was determined (Figure 8), it can be clearly seen that cell imaging becomes
more and more obvious with the increase of material content. The first
column is bright-field image, the second and third columns show the
image obtained by the green channel and the combined image of the
first and second columns, respectively. These results indicate that
the intensity of fluorescence image is closely related to the concentration
of pHRCDs in the culture medium, which indicates that the probe has
a wide range of applications in biological imaging and biomolecular
detection.

concentrations of pHRCDs at 37 °C for 4 h: (a) 100 μg/mL

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a novel biocompatible
pHRCDs based on
DA, which could sensitively detect GSSG by one-excitation and dual-emission
method. Also, AA was selectively detected based on the constructed
pHRCDs/GSH fluorescent system. Under optimized experimental conditions,
the dual-response fluorescent probe can detect GSSG and AA in the
linear range of 1.2–3.6 and 27–35 μM with detection
limits of 0.1 and 3.1 μM. Moreover, the pHRCDs/GSH fluorescence
system was successfully applied to the detection of AA in the serum
samples with satisfactory results. The pHRCDs and pHRCDs/GSH fluorescence
systems have significant biocompatibility, low toxicity, high sensitivity,
and good selectivity, demonstrating the great application potential
in biological imaging and molecular detection.
