Mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) catalyzes the phosphorylation
of thymidine (dT) and deoxycytidine (dC) and is essential for mitochondrial
function in post-mitotic tissues. The phosphorylation of dT shows
negative cooperativity, but the phosphorylation of dC follows classical
Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The enzyme is feedback-inhibited
by its end products deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) and deoxycytidine
triphosphate (dCTP). In order to better understand the reaction mechanism
and the negative cooperative behavior, we conducted isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (ITF) quenching
studies with purified recombinant human TK2. Cooperative binding was
observed with dT but not dC by the ITC analysis in accordance with
earlier enzyme kinetic studies. The phosphate donor adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) did not bind to either dTTP-bound or dTTP-free enzymes but bound
tightly to the dT– or dC–TK2 complexes with large differences
in enthalpy and entropy changes, strongly suggesting an ordered binding
of the substrates and different conformational states of the ATP and
dT– and dC–TK2 ternary complexes. dTTP binding was endothermic;
however, dCTP could not be shown to interact with the enzyme. ITF
quenching studies also revealed tight binding of dT, dC, deoxythymidine
monophosphate, deoxycytidine monophosphate, and dTTP but not adenosine
5′-diphosphate or ATP. These results strongly indicate an ordered
sequential binding of the substrates and ordered release of the products
as well as different conformational states of the active site of TK2.
These results help to explain the different kinetics observed with
dT and dC as substrates, which have important implications for TK2
regulation in vivo.

==== Body
Introduction
Thymidine
kinase 2 (TK2) phosphorylates thymidine (dT) and deoxycytidine
(dC) to their respective monophosphate and a complete deficiency of
this enzyme is lethal.1−3 TK2
showed different kinetic behaviors with its natural substrates, that
is, the phosphorylation of dT showed negative cooperativity with biphasic
substrate saturation curves, but dC phosphorylation followed hyperbolic
Michaelis–Menten kinetics.4,5 Active native
or recombinant TK2 is present in the form of monomers, dimers, or
oligomers.4,6−8 Furthermore, the enzyme is feedback-inhibited by
deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) and deoxycytidine triphosphate
(dCTP).7 Recombinant TK2 contains enzyme-bound
dTTP, dCTP, and to lesser extent deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP).9 However, in a later study, only dTTP was found
to be present in an equimolar ratio in highly purified recombinant
TK2.10

The TK2 protein is expressed
at low level in all tissue types, and in cultured cells, the TK2 protein
concentration was upregulated in stationery phase cells, whereas in
rapidly dividing cells, the levels of TK2 were significantly lower.11 TK2 plays an important role in the synthesis
of a DNA precursor for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and in
repair of nuclear DNA.12,13 Deficiency of TK2 activity, due
to point mutations, deletions, or insertions in the TK2 gene, results
in devastating mitochondrial diseases with predominant mtDNA depletions
and in some cases with additional multiple mtDNA deletions.14−16 Initial studies showed that the
residual TK2 activity correlated with the severity of the disease
and also the time of onset; however, with more cases reported, this
correlation could not be verified.16−18 However, alteration in the TK2 substrate specificity
and loss of negative cooperativity have been observed in mutant TK2
enzymes identified in patients with severe mtDNA depletion syndrome
(MDS).7,15,19 Tissues that
have high energy demand are generally most affected by mtDNA depletion
or deletions, and therefore, TK2 deficiency predominantly led to skeletal
muscle myopathy, but multiple organ involvement has also been reported.16,20,21

Many pyrimidine nucleoside
analogues, such as zidovudine (AZT) and cytarabine (araC) used in
antiviral and anticancer therapy, are either substrates or inhibitors
for TK2 and often cause mitochondrial side effects. Inhibition or
downregulation of TK2 may play an important role in the observed mitochondrial
toxicities.22,23 The defect in TK2 overall activity
and/or alteration in kinetics can lead to mitochondrial dCTP and dTTP
pool imbalance and mtDNA depletion.18

In order to better understand the complex kinetic behavior of TK2,
we conducted isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and intrinsic
tryptophan fluorescence (ITF) studies with purified recombinant TK2
to elucidate the basis for its kinetic properties with different substrates
and feedback inhibitors.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
dT, dC, adenosine
5′-(gamma-thio) triphosphate (ATPγS), and 3′-fluoro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine
(FLT) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Stock solutions of dTTP and
dCTP (100 mM) were from Promega. 3′-Azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine
(AZT)
was from Carbosynth.

Enzyme Preparation
Recombinant human TK2, with an N-terminal truncation of 55 amino
acids, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by metal affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-Sepharose column. Purified TK2 contained an enzyme-bound dTTP at
1:1 ratio. In the case where the dTTP-free enzyme was needed, the
enzyme-bound dTTP was removed by incubation with dT and ATP and confirmed
by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis essentially as
described in the literature10 and dialyzed
against 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, and 1 mM MgCl2 overnight
at 4 °C with two buffer changes before being used in the subsequent
experiment. Protein concentrations were determined by the absorbance
at 280 nm and calculated using the TK2 subunit molecular mass.

ITC Studies
ITC experiments were carried
out by using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, GE Healthcare) at
25 °C. The TK2 protein (40 μM, dTTP bound or free) dialyzed
in buffer containing 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, and 1 mM MgCl2 was placed in the sample cell (1.4 mL) and titrated with different
concentrations of ligands. All ligand solutions were prepared in the
final dialysis buffer. The ligand concentration in the injection syringe
was 1–3 mM. A typical experiment consisted of a first control
injection of 2 μL, followed by 24 injections, each of 8 μL
and 16 s duration, at a 500 s interval.

Control experiment was
done by titrating the ligand into the dialysis buffer or titrating
the buffer into the enzyme. Raw data were collected, corrected for
ligand heat dilution, and integrated using the Microcal Origin 7 software
supplied with the instrument. A single-site binding model or two-site
binding model was used to fit the data by nonlinear regression analysis,
yielding the binding constants (KB), enthalpy
changes (ΔH), and entropy changes (ΔS). The best-fit model was chosen for each ligand. The Gibbs
free energy (ΔG) is calculated by the equation
ΔG = ΔH – TΔS. The equilibrium dissociation
constant (Kd) is calculated from the KB values (Kd = 1/KB).

ITF Quenching
Studies
The ITF studies were conducted by using a Varian
Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian) at 21 °C
in a buffer containing 10 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 0.2 M NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 2 μM TK2 (dTTP bound or free). Excitation was
carried out at 295 nm to avoid any influence by the fluorescence of
tyrosine residues. The fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded
between 305 and 400 nm with a slit of 5 nm. The effects of ligand
were measured by titrating known concentrations (0.05–4000
μM) of each ligand. In the absence of a quencher, the TK2 fluorescence
spectrum shows a maximum at 330 nm. The changes in fluorescence intensity
(ΔF = F0 – F) were measured as a function of the added ligand concentration.
Both background emission and ligand dilution effect were corrected.
Data were fitted using the Stern–Volmer equation F0/F = 1 + Ks*[Q], where [Q]
is the concentration of the quencher and Ks is the association constant, and the modified Stern–Volmer
equation F0/ΔF =
1/(faKa[Q])
+ 1/fa, where [Q] is the concentration
of the quencher, Ka is the quenching constant
of the accessible fraction, and fa is
the fraction of the initial fluorescence that is accessible to the
quencher.24

Equilibrium binding constants
were calculated by using nonlinear regression analysis of the fluorescence
data using the Prism 5 GraphPad software with an in-built equation
for binding the saturation model, for example, one-site specific binding
ΔF = ΔFmax*[S]/(Kd + [S]), where [S] is the ligand concentration
and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant.
Data are presented as the mean ± SD of four to six independent
measurements.

Results
Binding of dT but Not dC Exhibited Negative Cooperativity
dT and dC were titrated to the dTTP-bound enzymes, and in both
cases, binding occurred with negative ΔH and
ΔS values, which resulted in negative ΔG values (Table 1), indicating that the binding of dT and dC to TK2 is an energetically
favorable event and that dT and dC are able to compete out the enzyme-bound
dTTP because both dT and dC could bind to the dTTP-bound enzyme (Figure 1). These results
are in agreement with earlier studies demonstrating that incubation
with dT or dC releases enzyme-bound dTTP.9,10

c dTTP-bound
enzyme.

However, the binding of dT and dC to the dTTP-bound enzyme yielded
two distinct titration curves; the titration curves for dT binding
(Figure 1A) did not
show the commonly observed hyperbolic shape as was observed in the
case of dC binding (Figure 1B). Instead, it gave a sigmoidal trace of the heat data, with
a more complex behavior where the heat release increased with the
first few injection and then reached a maximum and subsequently decreased
(Figure 1A). The dT
binding isotherm was fitted using the two-site binding model, which
yielded two binding constants, one with high affinity (Kd1 = 0.55 μM) and the other with lower affinity
(Kd2 = 6.13 μM) (Table 1). Interestingly, the Kd values for dT and dC are in the same range
as the KM values determined using radiochemical 3H-Thd phosphorylation assays.7,25

ATP Does Not Bind to Either the dTTP-Free or dTTP-Bound
Enzyme but Binds to the Enzyme–Nucleoside Complexes
To study the binding capacity of ATP, the phosphate donor of the
TK2-catalyzed reaction, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, that is, ATPγS,
was used. ATPγS was titrated with either dTTP-bound or dTTP-free
TK2. As shown in Figure 2A, titration with ATPγS showed no heat response, indicating
that there is no specific interaction of ATPγS to either the
dTTP-bound or dTTP-free enzyme. However, when ATPγS was titrated
to the enzyme–dT (E–dT) or enzyme–dC (E–dC)
complexes, a typical binding isotherm was observed, which is exothermic
with large negative enthalpy changes (Figure 2B,C). The binding constants for ATPγS
to E–dT and E–dC were 1.1 × 106 and
5.0 × 105 M–1 and the dissociation
constants were 0.9 and 20 μM, respectively (Table 1).

Figure 2 Representative
ITC titration curves and binding isotherms of ATPγS titrated
to free enzyme (A) or E–dT (B) and E–dC (C) complex.

Because ATP did not
bind to the free enzyme but to the E–dT or E–dC complexes,
we propose that the binding of dT or dC induced a conformational change
of the enzyme, which allowed formation of an ATP–nucleoside–enzyme
ternary complex. To test if this binding order is common among deoxynucleoside
kinases, we titrated ATPγS to human recombinant dC kinase (dCK)
in the presence and absence of dC and found that ATPγS does
not bind to dCK alone but bind to the dCK–dC complex, similar
to what was observed here with TK2 (Supporting Information, Figure S1).

Binding
of Feedback Inhibitors
Both dTTP and dCTP are feedback inhibitors
of TK2 with Ki values in the micromolar
range.7 Purified recombinant TK2 has been
shown to contain enzyme-bound dTTP, dCTP, and to a lesser extent dATP
9, and in a more recent study, only dTTP was bound to the purified
TK2 enzyme.10 The enzyme-bound deoxyribonucleotide
triphosphates (dNTPs) could be removed by incubation with dT or other
nucleosides with or without ATP.9,10 In order to study the
binding affinity of feedback inhibitors, the dTTP-free TK2 was used.
The binding of dTTP exhibited an endothermic heat response (Figure 3A) with a positive
ΔH value; however, the large positive ΔS value upon dTTP binding resulted in a negative ΔG value (Table 1), which makes the binding of dTTP thermodynamically feasible
and also indicates profound conformational changes upon dTTP binding.
The binding constant is 2.8 × 104 M–1 and the dissociation constant is 36 μM, which is higher than
the Ki values (2.5 μM) determined
in enzyme kinetic experiments (Table 1).7 Titration of dCTP, however,
showed no heat changes in the isothermogram, which most likely represents
a typical unspecific interaction toward the macromolecule in an ITC
experiment (Figure 3B). These results are in accordance with our earlier study, which
showed that only dTTP was bound to the purified TK2.10

ITF Spectrometric Studies
Human mitochondrial TK2 possesses five tryptophan residues5 that can be used to monitor the fluorescence
quantum changes because of conformational changes induced by ligand
binding. The recombinant TK2 used in this study is an N-terminal truncated
form containing four tryptophans,5 and
all of them are conserved in the TK2 enzyme family. On the basis of
a TK2 structure model,15 three of them
are located at the dimer interface and one is located at one of the
two α-helices that form the lid region. These suggest that ITF
could be a useful technique to study the subunit interaction and/or
conformational changes in the TK2 structure upon substrate binding.
The TK2 fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded between 305 and
400 nm with a λmax of 330 nm. To study the effects
of ligand binding-induced conformational changes, the natural substrates
dT, dC, and ATP and their products deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP),
deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP), and adenosine 5′-diphosphate
(ADP), the feedback inhibitor dTTP as well as the nucleoside analogues
AZT and FLT were titrated to the dTTP-bound or dTTP-free TK2 in a
concentration range of 0.5–4000 μM. In addition, ATPγS
was used to study the ATP effects on dT and dC binding to the enzyme.
Addition of dT, dC, dTMP, dCMP, and dTTP as well as AZT and FLT caused
quenching of the fluorescence emission but not the addition of ATP
or ADP (Supporting Information, Figure
S2). A slight λmax shift (from 330 to 328 nm) was
observed when dTMP or dCMP was added to the enzyme.

The Stern–Volmer
plot, that is, a F0/F versus dT concentration plot, yielded a downward curvature at low
dT concentration (0.05–40 μM), which is a characteristic
feature of two fluorophore populations, one of which is not accessible
to the quencher, whereas the tryptophan residues close to the protein
surface are quenched. At higher dT concentration (40–4000 μM),
the Stern–Volmer plot is linear (Figure 4A and Supporting Information, Figure S2). Fitting the fluorescence data with the modified Stern–Volmer
equation, that is, F0/ΔF versus 1/dT concentrations, a fraction of the initial fluorescence
that was accessible to dT (fa = 25%) could
be identified, with a quenching constant of 0.16 μM–1 (Figure 4B and Table 2). The other ligands
dTMP, dC, dCMP, AZT and FLT, and dTTP gave similar quenching profiles
as dT (Supporting Information, Figure S2)
and a fractional initial accessible fluorescence of approximately
20–40% (Table 2). The λmax value and fa data (Table 2) indicate
that only one of the four tryptophan residues is involved in the initial
quenching of the TK2 fluorescence emission induced by ligand binding
at a low concentration range. The results also demonstrate that TK2
undergoes conformational changes upon ligand binding. The equilibrium
binding constant of each ligand was calculated by the nonlinear regression
fitting of the fluorescence changes (ΔF) in
the presence of ligands using the best-fit binding model (Figure 4C and Table 3).

Discussion
Conformational Changes
upon Substrate Binding and Negative Cooperativity
Cooperativity
is ascribed to the conformational changes in the macromolecular structure
induced by ligand binding. ITC is an ideal method to study cooperativity
because it can register even very small changes in enthalpy and entropy
and thus free energy changes that reflect both local changes, for
example, ionic, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions, and
global dynamic motions of a protein molecule interacting with a ligand.26

TK2 exhibits negative cooperativity with
dT and the dT analogue AZT but not with the alternate substrate dC
as shown in earlier enzyme kinetic studies,4,5,18 but the mechanism of this negative cooperativity
is not known. TK2 belongs to the deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), dCK,
and Drosophila melanogaster–deoxynucleoside
kinase (Dm–dNK) enzyme family, whose three-dimensional (3D)
structures have revealed one nucleoside binding site (phosphate acceptor)
and one ATP binding site (phosphate donor) per subunit. The two structural
elements for the binding of a phosphate donor, for example, the lid
region and the p-loop, undergo large conformational changes upon substrate
binding and during catalysis.27−29 Although the TK2 structure has not been solved, a TK2 structure
model, built based on sequence homology to and structure of the Dm–dNK,15,28 predicts one nucleoside (phosphate acceptor) binding site and one
phosphate donor binding site per subunit. Dm–dNK, dGK, and
dCK are dimers both in crystal structures and in the native state.27−29 TK2, however, has been shown
to occur as monomers, dimers, and tetramers in solution,6,7,9,30 which
support the observed cooperative behavior of multimeric enzymes. In
this study, we used two biophysical methods to determine the interaction
of TK2 with its substrates. The ITC studies showed a distinct difference
in isothermal grams of dT and dC binding to the dTTP-bound enzyme,
for example, a hyperbolic curve for dC binding and a sigmoidal curve
for dT binding, indicating that only the binding of dT shows negative
cooperativity. Similar binding isothermal grams have been observed
for the binding of MgATP or MgADP to the Archaeoglobus
fulgidus–GlnK2 protein and the binding of cyclic
AMP to hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated channels.
These binding isothermal results suggested the presence of more than
one ligand binding site per molecule with different binding affinities
for the same ligand that is negative cooperativity.31,32 Fitting
the dT binding data yielded two binding constants, suggesting that
there are two binding sites with different affinities, one with high
affinity and the other with low affinity. Because one TK2 subunit
contains only one dT binding site, it is most likely that binding
of dT to one subunit induced conformational changes on the adjacent
subunit and thus affects the binding affinity of the next incoming
dT, giving cooperativity. The large changes in enthalpy and entropy
values suggest that binding of dT results in both local and global
conformational changes of the TK2 structure. Binding of dC, however,
showed smaller changes in both enthalpy and entropy values and thus
less effect on enzyme conformation. These results suggest that dC
binds to a limited set of conformational states of TK2 as compared
to dT.

Intrinsic fluorescence spectrometry is a sensitive method
to study the protein–ligand interaction, where changes in accessibility
of tryptophan residues can reveal substrate binding-induced conformational
changes.24 Fluorescence quenching caused
by the addition of dT and other tested substrates/products showed
downward curvatures at low substrate concentrations but linear curves
at high concentrations in Stern–Volmer plots. This indicates
that at a low substrate concentration, apparently only one of the
four tryptophan residues is accessible, and furthermore, the λmax (330 nm) value suggests that Trp-188 located on the α-helix
that formed the lid region is involved in the observed fluorescence
quenching.28 These results also demonstrated
local as well as global conformational changes of TK2 upon ligand
binding.

We also observed a significant difference in the fluorescence
intensity (ΔFmax) of the dTTP-free
TK2 as compared with that of the dTTP-bound enzyme (Table 3), indicating that there is
a large structural (conformational) difference between the dTTP-free
and dTTP-bound TK2. We also found a large difference in the equilibrium
binding constant for dTTP obtained with ITF (3.64 ± 1.0 μM),
which is in the same range as the Ki values
(∼2.5 μM) determined by enzyme kinetic assays, but with
ITC, the Kd value was much higher (36
μM). The reason for this discrepancy between the two methods
is not known, but one explanation could be that a large fraction of
the dTTP-free enzyme is partly denatured during the ITC measurements
because the dTTP-free enzyme is not as stable as the dTTP-bound TK2.10 Furthermore, the duration of the ITC measurement
is much longer (∼4 h) than the ITF experiment (<1 min).
A much higher protein concentration is also used in the ITC experiment,
which may lead to increased denaturation of the TK2 protein.

Comparison of Equilibrium Binding Constants
with KM and/or S1/2 Values
Earlier studies using the radiochemical
method to study the steady-state reaction rate of TK2 by measuring
the formation of radiolabeled products over a period of time under
the conditions that one of the substrates is in excess, the KM or S1/2 values
were deduced by nonlinear regression fitting of data to the Michaelis–Menten
or Hill equation and represent the substrate concentrations at which
the reaction rate was 1/2 of the Vmax.
Therefore KM or S1/2 values are not true substrate binding constants. In this
study, we measured individual substrates or product binding constants
by using two different biophysical methods. The results from the ITC
studies showed that the binding constant of dT is 65 times higher
than that of dTTP, whereas the binding constant of dC is 12 times
higher than that of dTTP. Therefore, both dT and dC are able to displace
the enzyme-bound dTTP. The binding constant of dT, which is 5 times
higher than that of dC, explained why dT is more efficient in removing
the enzyme-bound dTTP, as shown in earlier study.10 With the dTTP-bound enzyme, the binding affinity of dT
is 3 times higher than that of dC, and thus, dT is the preferred substrate
(Table 1). Moreover,
the binding constants for dT and dC with the dTTP-bound enzyme are
in the same range as the KM values reported
earlier.5,7 The differences in dT and dC binding constants
can be explained by the larger enthalpy and entropy changes upon dT
binding compared to dC binding, which also suggest that dT binding
induced large conformational changes/rearrangements, whereas dC binding
induced minor and possibly different changes in the active site conformations
(Table 3).

It
was demonstrated in this study that ATP does not bind to TK2 in the
absence of nucleosides (the phosphate acceptors) using two different
methods. However, the presence of ATP did influence the binding affinity
of the phosphate acceptor as shown by the ITF method because significantly
different binding constants for dC in the absence and presence of
ATPγS were observed (Table 3). Furthermore, the binding constants for dT and dC,
determined using the ITF method in the presence of ATPγS with
the dTTP-bound enzyme, were similar to the KM values reported earlier using the radiochemical activity
assay.5,7 These results strongly suggest that formation
of a catalytically competent ternary complex is the rate-limiting
step in TK2 catalysis.

ITC studies using nonhydrolyzable ATP
analogue showed a larger change in the enthalpy and entropy values
upon binding of ATPγS to the E–dT complex than to the
E–dC complex, suggesting that binding of ATPγS to the
E–dT complex induced large conformational changes in E–dT
than to the E–dC complexes. The differences in ΔG values in ATPγS binding to E–dT as compared
to the E–dC complex may explain the higher catalytic efficiency
with dT as compared to dC.

Similar to TK2, the crystal structure
of TK1 contained the feedback inhibitor dTTP,33 and in the crystal structures of human dGK and dCK, the feedback
inhibitor, that is, dATP, was also present.27,34 These
results suggested that under physiological conditions, these kinases
are occupied by their feedback inhibitors, most likely because of
the fact that the in vivo dNTP concentrations are normally much higher
than deoxynucleoside concentrations.35 Therefore,
the overall activities of these nucleoside kinases toward each substrate
apparently depend on the concentration of and the ability of the nucleoside
substrates to compete with the bound feedback inhibitors, leading
to active enzymes. This process probably determines the initial catalytic
rates of the deoxynucleoside kinases in vivo.

TK2 Reaction Mechanism—Ordered Sequential Binding of
the Substrates and Ordered Product Release
Both ITC and ITF
studies provided evidence that substrate binding followed an ordered
sequential pathway because ATP did not bind to either dTTP-free or
dTTP-bound TK2 but only to the E–dT or E–dC complexes.
Therefore, the binding order must proceed with dT or dC binding first
to the enzyme and compete out the enzyme-bound dTTP, which is followed
by ATP binding to the E–dT or E–dC complexes (Figure 5). ITF studies also
showed that both dTMP and dCMP bind tightly to the enzyme, whereas
ADP does not, indicating that ADP is leaving the enzyme prior to the
release of dTMP or dCMP (Figure 5). Such an ordered reaction mechanism probably also
applies to the TK2 family of enzymes because this is also the binding
order of human dCK in the ITC experiment (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Earlier studies using the ITC method
showed that the Herpes simplex virus type 1 TK, with some structural
similarities to the dCK, dGK, and TK2 family of enzymes, has the same
binding order, that is, ATP binds only to the E–dT complex.36

Figure 5 Schematic representation
of the TK2 reaction mechanism—ordered sequential binding of
the substrates and order release of products. dT binds to either the
dTTP-bound or dTTP-free enzyme prior the binding of ATP; phosphorylation
occurred after binding of both substrates and products (ADP and dTMP)
formed; ADP released before the release of dTMP.

The kinetic mechanism
proposed earlier for human dCK and Mycoplasma dAK (deoxyadenosine kinase) based on steady-state kinetics suggested
that binding of ATP occurs before the binding of the phosphate acceptors.37,38 Structural studies by Hazra et al. showed that human dCK adopts
two conformational states: an open conformational state for substrate
binding and product release and a closed conformational state for
catalysis.39 From a 3D structure point
of view, it seems more plausible that the nucleosides bind to the
enzyme before ATP because the nucleoside binding site would be blocked
if ATP binds first.

Physiological
Implications
Alterations in TK2 activity or kinetic behavior
have been observed in mutant TK2 identified in human patients with
MDS. The H121N mutant TK2 has nearly 100% efficiency with dT but only
∼25% with dC, and it has lost the negative cooperativity with
dT, which resulted in an alteration in the ratio of dT and dC phosphorylation
at physiological relevant concentrations, which apparently led to
MDS.7,14 Additional TK2 mutations found in MDS patients,
for example, T77M and R161K19 and T230A
and R225W,15 also showed altered ratios
of dT and dC phosphorylation in addition to the drastically reduced
total TK2 activity. Furthermore, alterations of intracellular dT concentration
in the case of dT phosphorylase deficiency cause imbalanced dTMP and
dCMP production by TK2 because of the difference in kinetics and competition
between dT and dC.6 The resulting high
dTTP and low dCTP concentrations are the likely cause of mtDNA depletion
and deletions.40 Mouse model studies have
shown that a sustained systemic increase in the dC concentration could
restore dCTP levels in the mitochondria of mice with defect dT phosphorylase.
Furthermore, administration of dC and dT or dTMP and dCMP delayed
the disease onset, reduced the severity of the phenotypic manifestation,
and prolonged the survival of the TK2-deficient mice.41−43 These results indicate that coadministration
of deoxynucleosides could be used to reduce the mitochondrial toxicity
caused by antiviral and anticancer therapy.

Thus, detailed knowledge
of the structure and function of the TK2 enzyme will most likely increase
our capacity to develop personalized treatment options for the severe
mitochondrial disorders in the future.
