The Marcus–Hush theory has
been successfully applied to
describe and predict the activation barriers and hence the electron-transfer
(ET) rates in several physicochemical and biological systems. This
theory assumes that in the ET reaction, the geometry of the free Gibbs
energy landscape is parabolic, with equal curvature near the local
minimum for both reactants and products. In spite of its achievements,
more realistic models have included the assumption of the two parabolas
having not the same curvature. This situation is analyzed by the Nelsen’s
four-point method. As a benchmark to compare the Marcus–Hush
approximation to a precise calculation of the excitation energy, we
studied the non-ET process of the electronic excitation of the aluminum
dimer that has two local minima (3∑g– and 3∏u electronic states) and allows to obtain
analytically the Marcus–Hush nonsymmetric parameters. We appraise
the ability of the Marcus–Hush formula to approximate the analytical
results by using several averages of the two reorganization energies
associated with the forward and backward transitions and analyze the
error. It is observed that the geometric average minimizes the relative
error and that the analytical case is recovered. The main results
of this paper are obtained by the application of the Nelsen’s
four-point method to compute the reorganization energies of a large
set of potential π-conjugated molecules proposed for organic
photovoltaic devices using the above-mentioned averages for the Marcus–Hush
formula. The activation energies obtained with the geometric average
are significantly larger for some donor–acceptor pairs in comparison
with the previously employed arithmetic average, their differences
being suitable for experimental testing.

Introduction
The longstanding interest
on the electron-transfer (ET) process1−4 relies on its influence within a plethora
of physicochemical and
biological phenomena, such as electrochemical reactions,5−12 DNA damage and repair,13−16 interactions between peptides and other macromolecules,17−20 photosynthesis,21 biochemical processes,22−24 model systems,25,26 and the technological interest
on the exciton transfer in organic photovoltaics.27−55

Historically, the theoretical models to understand ET can
be traced
back to the pioneer work of Marcus5−8,56,57 and Hush.58,59 The Marcus–Hush
theory exhibits a mutual dependence of the ET rate (kET) and the reaction free energy (ΔG0).60 As a consequence, the
theory exhibits a maximum of the reaction rate when −ΔG0 is equal to the reorganization energy λ.
Thus, there exists a region where the increase of the reaction driving
force ΔG0 (reactants → products)
leads to an increase in kET, which is
known as the Marcus normal region. Additionally, the theory exhibits
a region where the increase of the driving force results in a decrease
in the reaction rate, that is, when −ΔG0 > λ, which is known as the Marcus inverted
region.60−62 Remarkably, the activation free energy ΔG† can be calculated from the reorganization
energy
λ and the driving force ΔG0.

A first assumption of the Marcus–Hush theory is to
consider
that the electron is transferred only when the reactant and product
states have the same energy, as required by the Franck–Condon
approximation and the energy conservation principle in the absence
of interaction with external energy sources (such as photons). This
equi-energetic situation (stabilization of products or destabilization
of reactants) required by the Marcus–Hush model is due to environment
fluctuations.63 The second assumption is
that the solvent response to variations in molecular densities is
linear around the relaxed state; hence, the free energy is quadratic.
This has two consequences. On the one hand, the free energies can
be modeled by two parabolas centered at the stable states of reactants
and products. On the other hand, these two parabolas have the same
curvature,64 indicating that the two reorganization
energies (products → reactants and reactants → products)
are the same.

Despite the hard assumption that both parabolas
have the same curvature,
the Marcus–Hush theory is both qualitatively and quantitatively
accurate for most systems. However, in general, it is known that the
solvent response is nonlinear and that it manifests through differences
between the curvatures of the parabolas.63 Even in such a situation, the Marcus–Hush theory fits as
a first approximation that can give consistent predictions.63,65,66 In spite of the previous mentioned
achievements, many important cases are known where the equal curvature
assumption fails and several attempts to generalize the Marcus–Hush
theory have been reported.8−12,63,65−69 The inclusion of different curvatures to account for nonlinear solvent
responses as well as other internal molecular features has been previously
discussed8−12,63,65−69 but is still an open problem.

The reorganization energy λ
is normally split into internal
(λi) and external or “outer” (λo) contributions. The internal reorganization energy λi accounts for changes in bond lengths and other structural
parameters of the molecules. In gas-phase reactions, it is the only
contribution to the system reorganization energy. In this sense, λi can be achieved by quantum mechanical calculations.31,70−76 The external term, λo, comes from the contributions
of the solvent molecules to the reorganization energy, and in condensed
phase reactions (liquids or solids), this term becomes dominant. Explicit
consideration of solvent–molecule interactions makes the system
quantum mechanically intractable, hence λo is often
calculated by means of classical dynamics methodologies or by employing
implicit solvent quantum mechanical models.

Regardless of this
complication in computing λo, an exceptional effort
has been done to calculate λi, and many quantum mechanical
schemes have been introduced.31,70−77 One of the methods most often employed is the four-point scheme
proposed by Nelsen,77 which has been extensively
applied because of its simplicity and it has been successfully proven
for many systems.72,73,78−90 Particularly, it has been used in the computation of electron self-exchange
reactions.83,85,90 In such a scheme, the Marcus–Hush theory provides a method
to find the intersection between the two parabolas by means of the
knowledge of just four points in the free energy surface. Two points
are the free energy of reactants and products in their respective
local minima geometry, and the other two points are obtained by computing
the free energy at the reactants’ geometry in the potential
energy surface (PES) of the products and vice versa. In this scheme,
the energetic differences between the molecules in their stable and
nonstable states are related with two reorganization energies (λ1 and λ2).

In this work, we analyze
several averages of these two reorganization
energies as a method to generalize the Marcus–Hush theory to
include parabolas with different curvatures, as has been tried in
previous reports.85,90 In such an attempt, we discuss
the error of employing the distinct averages in a model system of
an aluminum dimer, which has been extensively investigated both experimentally91 and theoretically.92 This simple model, while not an ET system, allows us to explore
analytically the reorganization energies as well as the driving force
by noting that the Marcus–Hush theory can be seen as a method
to find the intersection between the parabolas along the reaction
coordinate. The analysis of the relative error allows us to explore
novel donor and acceptor molecules used in organic photovoltaics by
means of the averaged reorganization energy.

The rest of the
paper is organized as follows. In section II, we outline the Marcus–Hush theory. In section
III, Results and Discussion, a simple diatomic
model is analytically solved and the ability of the Marcus–Hush
theory to recover the analytic solution is appraised, also we analyze
the ability of four different averages of the parabolic curvatures
to capture the analytic solution obtained for the aluminum benchmark
system. Next, we apply our findings to analyze the activation energy
prediction for photovoltaic donor–acceptor (D–A) pairs
and report results that can be relevant in applications. Finally,
in section IV, conclusions are presented.

Outline
of the Marcus–Hush Theory
The Marcus–Hush theory
schematic view of the system is shown
in Figure 1. The PES
geometry near the local minimum, for either reactants (red) or products
(blue), is approximated by a parabola with a defined curvature k. It is assumed that the species involved in the reaction
are structurally relaxed in their respective initial (x1) and final (x2) reaction
coordinate values. Moreover, the physical situation is the guess that
both local minima of reactants and products are connected along an
assumed reaction pathway, described by a complex N-dimensional specific reaction coordinate direction on the PES.

Figure 1 Idealized
parabolic PESs for reactants (G1(x), red) and products (G2(x), blue) in the electron self-exchange
process, M– ↔ M, as functions of the reaction
coordinate. The two parabolas have the same curvature near the respective
local minimum (x1 and x2). The activation energy ΔG† is given by the reorganization energy λ and
the driving force ΔG0 = G20 – G10.

In accordance with Figure 1, the corresponding parabolic equations are 1  and their intersection at x† defines the potential energy barrier as 2  with the definitions ΔG0 = G20 – G10 and λ = k(x2 – x1)2, where λ stands for the reorganization energy.
Application of the Marcus–Hush theory implies the knowledge
of merely k(x1 – x2) and remarkably not of the individual reaction
coordinates. The reorganization energy can be evaluated by 3  

Also, in
the case of two parabolas not having the same curvature
(k1 ≠ k2), the intersection between the curves can be analytically found.
In this case, the activation energy is strongly related both to the
reorganization energy previously mentioned λ1 (reactants
→ products) and to a new defined reorganization energy λ2 obtained in the reverse direction (products → reactants).

However, the analytical solution cannot be written in terms of
neither λ1 nor λ2. Rather the intersection
is related to the free activation energy ΔG†, so an approximate solution for k1 ≈ k2 can be achieved
by means of a Taylor expansion, giving the corresponding transition
state energy 4  

One can easily notice that eq 4 leads to the Marcus–Hush
formula (eq 2) when k1 = k2 = k3. Hence, the Marcus–Hush formula can
be seen as an approximation
to the analytical solution for small differences between λ1 and λ2. A detailed discussion on the analytical
and approximate solutions can be found in the Supporting Information.

To apply the above scheme to
an ET process, we first consider an
electron self-exchange reaction 5  and
denote by λI(M) and λII(M) the reorganization
energies
of the forward and backward
reactions, respectively, and the reaction driving force is ΔG ≠ 0, as depicted in Figure 2. The reorganization energy λI(M) is the required energy to reach the geometry of the products
from the geometry of the reactants without transferring the electron,
whereas λII(M) is the energy required to achieve
the positions of the atoms in the reactant complexes from the product
geometry without ET. Such reorganization energies are typically different,
as schematized in Figure 2. Those cases with very dissimilar λI and
λII are examples where one ET deeply influences the
relaxed geometry of the isolated donor or acceptor molecules.

Figure 2 Parabolic PESs
for reactants (red) and products (blue) in an electron
self-exchange process as a function of the reaction coordinate. Top:
M– ↔ M. Bottom: M– + M
→ M + M–. ΔG† is not obtained by only the value of λI, but a
new reorganization energy λII must be considered.

Computation of the activation
energy of reaction in eq 5 faces the disadvantage that the
curvature of the two parabolas could be different and that the application
of the Marcus–Hush formula is dubious; notwithstanding, we
could try to estimate the activation energy by the substitution of
either λI or λII in eq 2. However, a better approach is
to construct two parabolas of equal curvature to guarantee the validity
of eq 2. As can also
be seen in Figure 2, in this case, the equal curvature condition of the Marcus–Hush
theory is fulfilled by considering the electron self-exchange process 6  whose total reorganization
energy is the same
for the forward and backward directions and can be calculated considering
the adduct of the two molecules or by considering them as noninteracting
species. We adopt the second approach and compute an approximation
to this reorganization energy as the sum of their respective λI(M) and λII(M)85,90  while the driving force is ΔG0 = 0, thus substitution of λ(M) in eq 2 leads to ΔG† = λ(M)/4. Hence, a reliable option
to estimate the reorganization energy of the reaction in eq 5 is by means of different averages
of λI(M) and λII(M) (arithmetic,85 harmonic, or geometric) to use eq 2.

Let us now consider a general
ET reaction 7  with D and A denoting
donor and acceptor species,
respectively, and D– and A– their
ionized counterparts. This reaction can be split into two electron
self–exchange processes, and then the total free energy for
their respective local minima G10 and G20 is obtained as
the sum of both systems (donor plus acceptor).  and  where λ1 and λ2 denote the reorganization energies of the forward and backward
reactions, respectively, and the reaction driving force, ΔG0 ≠ 0.

The total reorganization
energy of this bimolecular system can
also be obtained as the different averages of λ1 and
λ2, similar to the electron self-exchange process.

Before we consider D–A systems, in the next section, we focus on a
system that can be solved analytically, followed by Marcus–Hush
parameters, and then we test the averages by computing the error with
respect to the exact result.

Results and Discussion
Analytic Marcus–Hush
Parameters for Al2
To study the relevant aspects
of the Marcus–Hush theory,
a simple diatomic aluminum system has been employed. This example
does not correspond to an ET reaction, but it helps to analyze the
case of two parabolas with different curvatures. It is worth to mention
that while the Marcus transition state theory is most broadly used
for ET, it is not limited to ET systems and is applicable to almost
any nonadiabatic process. Al2 has been observed to have
two local minima both experimentally91 and
theoretically.92 The spectroscopy experiment
reports a 3∏u electronic ground state
with a bond length of 2.7011 ± 0.0015 Å and a vibrational
frequency of 285.80 cm–1. Similarly, a 3∑g– electronic state with a bond length of 2.4665 ± 0.0024 Å
and a vibrational frequency of 350.01 cm–1 has been
reported. Figure 3 shows
an energy scan at the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof93/triplet zeta basis set94 theory
level as previously reported92 for the
triplet PES employing the Gaussian 09 suite,95 with two well-defined parabolas near each local minima. Despite
knowing that the energy order of the local minima for both electronic
states is wrongly predicted by density functional theory (DFT) methods,
we can analyze the local geometry as the normal modes are real91,92 after vibrational analysis. Both parabolic equations y = ax2 + bx + c can be easily obtained for their respective local minima.
The coefficients are summarized in Table 1, and the plots employing the coefficients
are shown in Figure 3 for both electronic states. The relevant Marcus–Hush parameters
were analytically obtained and presented in Table 2.

Figure 3 PESs employing the total energy (E, in mHa) and
the free Gibbs energy (G, in mHa) for Al2 as a function of the interatomic distance (r in
Å). For an easy visualization, an energy shift has been introduced
in the total energy (adding −18.5 mHa). Energy is referred
to the ground state.

a The curvature ki and the reorganization energy λi (in
Ha) are analytically obtained.

Starting from the 3∑g– electronic state, the bonding
distance can be increased to reach the intersection point. The energy
barrier is determined by the intersection point coordinates (x†, G(x†)). In this particular example, we need to know
only the dimer bond distance as the reaction coordinate results from
the knowledge of both analytical functions, and therefore, the reorganization
energy λ is not necessary to be applied in the Marcus–Hush
model.

The activation energy from the Marcus–Hush formula
can be
evaluated with different averages of the reorganization energies.
λ1 is used to estimate ΔG† when the system is going from reactants to products,
and λ2 appears when the system reaches the minimum
of the reactants starting from the PES of the products. We will consider
the arithmetic (λ̅1), harmonic (λ̅2), and geometric (λ̅3) averages, and
the arithmetic average of the first two (λ̅4) 8   9   10   11  

Because the reaction
coordinates in the λ = k(x2 – x1)2 equation are known for the Al2 system, for
the purpose of explaining the error of the different averages, we
will consider the curvature k and not the reorganization
energy λ as follows.

To delve into the general behavior
for arbitrary variations of
the ratio k1/k2 between parabolas and to analyze the error in such hypothetical
cases, defined as 12  we plot the relative error
(Figure 4) employing
the Marcus–Hush
formula for the different k’s as a function
of the curvature ratio of both parabolas (k2 = 0.057411 is fixed and k1 is varied).
For the Al2 system, the ratio k1/k2 ≈ 2.02. The error percentage
is obtained by multiplying the relative error by 100 and taking the
absolute value.

Figure 4 Top: Variation of the relative error in the calculation
of the
transition state energy (ΔG†) from the Marcus–Hush formula with different curvatures: k1, k2, k̅1, k̅2, k̅3, k̅4 as a function
of the curvature ratio, k1/k2, for fixed k2 = 0.05711.
Bottom: Detail of the previous plot. Percentage can be obtained from
the plots (see text).

It is observed that employing an average of the curvature k, the error is decreased in comparison with using either k1 or k2 (Figure 4), for k1/k2 ≤ 2, all the averages
give errors of less than 5%, whereas k1 and k2 separate immediately one from
the other. Besides, in spite of the fact that the relative error is
nonzero for all the curvatures explored, there are few regions where
the error decreases as seen in the bottom plot, where data with error
less than 5% and up to the ratio k1/k2 = 3 are displayed. It is also observed that
the geometrical average k̅3 and
the average of average k̅4 depart
slowly from zero error, specially they seem to be the best choices
for larger values of the ratio k1/k2. It is worth to mention that k̅4 is obtained from two averages. For a better understanding
of the error percentage, the activation energies ΔG† are computed (Table 3) for their respective reorganization energy
and compared with the analytical value obtained. It exhibits the good
agreement of the error obtained with k̅3 and k̅4 averages in comparison
to the previous error discussed. Employing either k̅3 or k̅4 averages, the
relative error is minimized and the closest value to the analytical
activation energy ΔG† is
obtained.

Organic Photovoltaic
Systems
One of the branches with
greater relevance to apply the ET Marcus–Hush theory is the
process between a donor and an acceptor molecule in an organic photovoltaic
(OPV) cell.31,75,76 In this work, a set of potential molecules (Figure 5) for OPV devices are employed to assess
the Nelsen’s four-point method and verify the best choice of
the reorganization energy in accordance with the Al2 dimer
discussion.

Figure 5 Structures in the set of representative π-donors and acceptors
used in this paper.

With this purpose, we
use the list of molecules compiled by Das
and Ghosh96 functionalized in all their
R-positions with methyls, and we did not consider another substituent.
Also, while it is known that only few of the possible pairs are suitable
D–A systems in the experiment,96 for the sake of completeness of our analysis, we considered all
possible combinations (120 D–A pairs). At the end of the section,
we present D–A pairs that have energy barriers potentially
attainable for practical applications; nevertheless, in the following
discussion, we do not restrict ourselves to these pairs.

The
total reorganization energies of the D–A system are
treated as two contributions separately.77 Each molecule is individually geometry-relaxed without considering
solvent interactions. Details of the computations are given in the Methods section at the end of this text. A summary
of the total energy and free Gibbs energy is reported in the Supporting Information, Tables S2 and S3.

The activation energy ΔG† is computed for each D–A system employing either λ1, λ2, or the arithmetic and geometric averages
λ̅1 and λ̅3, respectively
(the λ̅2 and λ̅4 averages
considered are reported in the Supporting Information). In Figure 6, it
can be observed that employing ΔG†(λ̅3) as our y-axis reference,
dispersion between ΔG†(λ̅1) and ΔG†(λ̅2) occurs for values higher than 2.0 eV. The activation energy
obtained by means of λ1 is in most cases lower than
employing λ2. Actually, there are several systems
where the ΔG†(λ2) is higher than all the other barriers obtained. Remarkably,
the ΔG†(λ̅3) shows an exceptional correlation for the 120 D–A
pairs with respect to ΔG†(λ̅1).

Figure 6 Comparison of ΔG† calculated
with λ̅1, λ1, or λ2 and those calculated with λ̅3. Linear
fit equations are as follows: f(x) = 1.023x – 0.028, with R2 = 0.997 (blue); f(x) = 1.049x + 0.097, with R2 = 0.909 (red); and f(x)
= 0.769x + 0.582, with R2 = 0.914 (orange). Main plot: Results for 37 pairs with ΔG† below 2.0 eV. Inset: results for all
the 120 pairs including unrealistic ΔG† up to 14 eV.

It is useful to mention that the arithmetic average λ̅1 has been previously employed in the computational model of
ET in a homogeneous oxidation of aqueous transition-metal ions by
dissolved molecular oxygen.85 In our analysis,
the arbitrary choice of either λ̅1 or λ̅3 seems not to represent a relevant difference and could be
indistinctly adopted to calculate the activation energy.

It
is instructive to analyze the components of ΔG† to explain the behavior displayed in Figure 6. The leading term
is proportional to the ratio between the squared free energy difference
and the reorganization energy, as is shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. In Figure S3, the term proportional to the reorganization energy
is shown. The influence of the chosen λ in the computations
is apparent through both figures, and their dispersions are consistent
with results presented in Figure 6, particularly that of the leading term.

On the
other hand, Figure S4 in the Supporting Information displays the poor correlation between ΔG† data computed with λ1 or alternatively with λ2, while Figure S5 shows the almost perfect linear fit among the data
computed with λ̅3 and with λ̅4. Such a linear correlation remarks the arbitrary choice between
λ̅3 and λ̅4.

At
this point, we discuss the predicted energetic barrier differences
when λ̅1 is replaced by λ̅3 in the four-point calculation scheme, as shown in Figure 7. Values calculated
with λ̅3 are larger than those using λ̅1, leading to a decrease in the predicted reaction rate. Such
energetic differences are suitable to be detected by experiments, as in most cases, that
is, in 64 pairs, energetic barrier differences are observed to be
larger than 10 meV, whereas in 54 pairs, differences are observed
to be larger than 20 meV. In D–A pairs (D2, D4, D5, D6, D7,
D8, D9)–A2, (D2, D4, D9)–A3, (D9, D10)–A5, and
(D2, D4, D9)–A11, we found differences larger than 100 meV.
To facilitate interpretation of the data, the numerical values plotted
in Figure 7 are presented
in Table S4 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 7 Energy differences ΔG†(λ̅3) – ΔG†(λ̅1) of the D–A pairs.
Differences larger than 10 meV are shown. The differences for the
pair A2–D9 (1.676 eV) and for the pair A2–D4 (0.542
eV) are not shown. Horizontal lines are displayed at 0.015, 0.03,
0.05, 0.075, 0.1, and 0.15, to facilitate interpretation.

Now, we analyze the qualitative behavior of our
results as a function
of the ratio λ1/λ2. With this aim,
we construct relative error plots using various references (assumed
true values). In these cases, we can neither calculate the error nor
make a variation of the reorganization energies, instead in Figure 8, we plot the error
(eq 12) with respect
to λ̅3. This plot is constructed under the
assumption that the only significant feature of the D–A pairs
is the ratio of the internal reorganization energies; this hard assumption
dismisses all other geometrical parameters that can influence reorganization,
such as the number of atoms.

Figure 8 Variation of the relative error in the calculation
of the activation
energy (ΔG†) from the Marcus–Hush
formula with λ1, λ2, λ̅1, λ̅2, and λ̅4 with respect to the reference λ3, as a function
of the reorganization energy ratio, λ1/λ2. Values for all the 120 D–A pairs are shown. Top:
λ1 < λ2 case. Bottom: λ1 > λ2 case.

In Figure 8, we
split the plot in two regions according to the relative value of λ1 with respect to λ2 (λ1 <
λ2 and λ1 > λ2),
showing that such an inequality does not influence the qualitative
behavior of the plots: both regions display very similar trends. We
observe that λ̅4 values are the closest to
zero error because of their almost perfect linear fit (see Figure
S5 in the Supporting Information), which
is also consistent with the Al2 dimer. Using the other
averages λ̅1 or λ̅2,
we get smaller errors than using the internal reorganization energies
λ1 or λ2, also in accordance with
the benchmark.

As discussed above, the activation energy computed
with λ1 is lower than that with λ̅3 for the
case λ1 > λ2 (negative relative
error, bottom plot in Figure 8), whereas it is larger for the case λ1 <
λ2 (positive relative error, top plot). Few exceptions
can be observed through the plots, but they do not alter the overall
behavior. The inverse situation is true for data computed with λ2, according to our discussion of Figure 6. Such a behavior is quite consistent with
the benchmark system, as can be assessed by comparing Figure 8 with Figure 4.

On the other hand, relative error
increases for all cases, with
the noteworthy exception of λ̅4 that lies close
to zero for all values of the ratio λ1/λ2 (Figure S5 can be used to understand
this behavior), also the benchmark displays such a feature: the values
calculated with λ̅3 and λ̅4 remain close to each other for smaller values of the ratio
(in particular, it is shown for the interval λ1/λ2 < 3, see Figure 4). It can be observed that in most cases, the ratio between
the λ’s shows that one is twice the other at most; this
situation prevails despite the dissimilarity of the considered molecules.

For the sake of completeness, we provide plots analogous to Figure 8 but with different
references in the Supporting Information. Figures S6–S8 display the relative
error data calculated when λ̅1, λ̅2, or λ̅4 are the references, respectively. Figures S9 and S10 display the data of λ1 and λ2 as references, respectively. The
same trends discussed for Figure 8 can be recovered from these plots.

To end this
section, we mention that in our exploration of the
methylated D–A pairs, we found 43 systems (36% of the considered
cases) with potential application to practical OPV devices because
they presented activation barriers smaller or around 2 eV. We present
these pairs and their activation energies in Table 4. Additionally, we display the energy differences
predicted by the use of the geometric average, λ̅3, instead of the arithmetic one λ̅1, and we observe that in 16 cases, such a difference is larger than
10 meV.

a Predicted activation
energy, ΔG†(λ̅3), differences
in activation energy from two different averages, ΔΔG† = ΔG†(λ̅3) – ΔG†(λ̅1), and ratio of predicted
rate constants at room T. All energies in electronvolt.

We analyze the impact of using
the geometric average on the ET
reaction rate in these cases. For such a purpose, we compute the ratio
between the rate constant computed with the geometric average, k(λ̅3), and the rate constant computed
with the arithmetic average, k(λ̅1), and present the results in the last column of Table 4. It can be observed
that many of the predicted energetic differences should lead to experimentally
detectable predictions in reaction rates because in many cases, the
factor is two or more, with respect to those rates calculated with
λ̅1.

Future work focused on finding species
with practical relevance
should consider several refinements of these data, as well as the
study of different substituents. A remarkable refinement would be
the consideration of quantum effects on the reaction rates, such as
in the Marcus–Hush–Jortner97−99 formalism.
Also, the consideration of solvent effects on the reorganization energies
through the inclusion of implicit solvent models could be important.
It is worth to mention that all these effects may lower the computed
energies and lead to technologically relevant findings.

Conclusions
The four-point Nelsen scheme to compute activation free energies
through the Marcus–Hush theory was appraised in two different
contexts with the purpose of explicitly considering differences in
the curvatures of the parabolas involved. This situation is very common
in its chemical and biological applications.

The first assessment
was performed in the context of the aluminum
dimer, Al2, a system that can be solved analytically under
the Marcus–Hush theory assumptions. We applied the four-point
Nelsen scheme involving different averages of the calculated parabolic
curvatures and then compared the results with the analytical solution.
The main result of this part is that the geometric average (λ̅3) and the composed average (λ̅4) drastically
diminish the error for all the considered values of the ratio between
the curvatures.

For a second assessment on more realistic systems,
we studied 120
D–A pairs with technological interest in the OPV field. For
these systems, we employed the four-point Nelsen scheme to compute
the free energy barriers associated with the ET reactions considering
different averages of the internal reorganization energies and found
that the computations strongly depend on our choice. In particular,
our interest was focused on the predicted differences between the
values calculated with the geometric and the arithmetic averages.
We found that predicted differences can be quite significant. In all
cases, an increase in the energetic barrier (slower ET) is predicted
when the geometric averages are employed.

On the other hand,
the overall trends displayed by both the geometric
and arithmetic averages on the 120 considered data are very similar
despite the differences predicted when each individual pair is considered.
Despite the hard assumptions of this work, we found an improvement
on the values that can be experimentally tested.

To validate
our choice of λ̅3 as the most
suitable quantity for the four-point Nelsen scheme, we built relative
error plots for the 120 D–A pairs, using different references.
All the relative error plots are very similar to those of the benchmark,
showing the strong dependence of the error on the ratio of the reorganization
energies. It must be stressed that this striking similarity occurs
under the hard assumption that the only relevant feature is the ratio
between the internal reorganization energies, hence dismissing any
other feature of the molecular systems. In all cases, the obtained
plots can be rationalized with the aid of Al2, where the
plotted values were computed analytically.

Finally, in 36% of
the considered cases, we predict activation
energies that may have practical relevance. Data calculated with λ̅1 and λ̅3 present reaction rates that
are different enough as to be discriminated experimentally.

Methods
D–A
OPV Systems
The Gaussian 09 suite95 was employed to perform the DFT computations.
The exchange and correlation including dispersion ωB97XD100 functional was employed. A correlation consistent
triple-ζ basis set cc-pVTZ101 was
employed. A vibrational analysis was performed to verify the local
minimum for each molecular geometry. As a first approximation, we
only considered the nuclear harmonic contributions to the partition
function for computation of the free Gibbs energy, and a future detailed
treatment would evaluate the influence of anharmonicity on the results.

To get the relevant parameters of the left parabola, we optimized
the neutral molecule to obtain G1(x1), following Figure 1, and then performed a single-point calculation
with this coordinates but changing the charge to get the anionic species
to compute G2(x1). For the right parabola, by an analogous procedure we obtain G2(x2) and G1(x2). We obtained
the reorganization energies through eq 3 and then used them and their averages, in addition
to the reaction driving force, ΔG0, in eq 2 to get the
corresponding activation energy barriers. In other words, what is
needed to apply the presently proposed technique is to calculate the
four-point Nelsen quantities and average them in the manner proposed
by eq 10 or 11.
