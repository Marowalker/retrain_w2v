In sprouting angiogenesis, a key process involved in
the development
and the intravasation of tumor tissues, the growth of vessel sprouts,
is determined by migration of single endothelial cells (ECs). This
paper presents an on-chip assaying method to investigate the migration
of individual ECs by simulating vessel sprouts with microchannels.
When chemical stimulus is present, ECs were observed to migrate individually
toward the source of factors instead of migrating collectively. The
validity of this method is shown by inducing EC migration with glioma
cell coculture and culture media doped with vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) 165. A positive correlation between cell displacement
and VEGF 165 concentration was observed. Difference in migrating ability
among cells was reflected by tracking single cells, which could reveal
cell heterogeneity in susceptibility to stimulus.

Introduction
Sprouting angiogenesis, the process where
new vessel branches are
generated from pre-existing ones, is an important process in cancer
development and metastasis for it enhances the oxygen and nutrient
supply of cancer tissues and provides a passage for tumor cell intravasion.
The vessel sprout generated in this process is led by an activated
“tip cell” that senses chemical factors and migrates
toward the gradient until it fuses with another sprout. This renders
its migration decisive for vessel guiding, and its speed reflects
the rate of sprout growth. A similar migrating behavior of ECs has
been reported to be induced chemically by factors or matrixes or mechanically
by shear stress.1−3 The mechanism of migration involves a list of sequential
events, including cell skeleton movement, forming of filopodia, and
sensing of factor gradient.1 Studies on
the effects of vessel endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), a main
angiogenic factor that induces EC migration through binding to receptor
VEGFR2, have revealed that this process involves a complex set of
components, including histone deacetylase 7.4 protein kinase D1,5 and regulator of
calcineurin 1.4,6 and the overall process
is still far from being clear. ECs are already known
to exhibit obvious heterogeneity in different tissue environments,7 so we may also expect heterogeneity from microenvironment
and intrinsic properties as well. As cells are known to exhibit notable
heterogeneity in their response to drug stimulations,8 considering the complex nature of the mechanism, this heterogeneity
may have a major impact on cell activation and migration, which would
affect the growth of vessel sprouts.

The deficits of in vivo
models, including limited throughput and
difficulty in manipulation and observation, urged in vitro models
on the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayer to
emerge.4,9 This led to the invention of scratch assay.
It is the most common method for migration assay by now,4,10 despite it simulates neither the geometry nor the scale of in vivo
scenarios nor is capable to sustain a gradient of angiogenic factors.
These deficiencies indicate a drastic difference in the microenvironment
that would lead to different cell behaviors. To overcome them, microfluidic-based
methods have been established, and to achieve better simulating accuracy,
most are combined with 3D culturing techniques to recreate an in vivo-like
tissue.11 Such a model was first established
by Zheng et al.12 where HUVEC cells in
collagen channels were reported to form tubes and invade into channel
walls. Nguyen et al.13 introduced angiogenic
factor gradient into the chip, inducing directed new branches to form
toward the angiogenic source. Bischel et al.14 utilized microchannels for vessel lumen generation. Kim et al.15 introduced glioma cell coculture into the model
for a more accurate microenvironment.

Recently, microfluidic
devices have been extensively utilized in
the development of single-cell analysis platform.16 Those in vitro models mentioned above have been successful
in simulating the angiogenesis process and are inspirational for single-cell
migration assays. However, extra effort is required as quantifying
by measuring the sprout length is no longer available. In addition,
cell interaction among EC tubes may conceal their individual properties.
Recently, it has been reported that this single-cell mode migration
can be triggered by highly degradable matrices where cell–cell
junctions were broken.17 This make culture
medium-filled microchannels desirable for single cell assays: microchannel
width hinders formation of cell–cell junctions, and culture
media impede cell migration less than gel matrices. While these properties
can achieve spatial separation of cells, they also enable the analysis
of the same cell on its response to a stimulation for a prolonged
time, which has been shown to be valuable for heterogeneity studies.8,18 In our previous works, we have utilized microchannels in cell migration
research studies.19,20 Exploiting this similarity, herein,
we combine previous on-chip models with microchannels and propose
an on-chip angiogenesis model for cell migration.

Results and Discussion
To achieve this, a chip, as
shown in Figure 1a,
was fabricated with poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) using soft lithography (Figure S1) with a uniform height of 120 μm. The chip has three chambers:
The middle holds an EC monolayer, such as HUVEC, mimicking the endothelium,
and the side chambers function as the source of angiogenic factors
where glioma cells such as U87 MG or angiogenic factors would be injected.
The 50 μm-wide microchannels were designed to simulate the microvessels
in their dimensions and, in addition, to restrict the horizontal EC
movement while allowing ECs to separate vertically. The chip design
is analogous with the in vivo situation, where the ECs form new vessel
sprouts toward the source of angiogenic factors.

Figure 1 Design of the microfluidic
device and the experiment scheme. (a)
Two sets of microchannels are symmetrically placed on the endothelial
cell culture chamber as control and treatment. The in vivo scenario
was illustrated to show the correspondence. (b) Channels are sealed
at first to allow independent cell growth in channels. They are later
made open and allow factors to form a gradient, and endothelial cells
would respond to the stimulus and migrate toward the glioma cell chamber.
Certain cells will break away from the bulk during this process, exhibiting
a single-cell migrating behavior.

When the gradient of chemical factors is generated
by diffusion,
the activated EC cells will migrate toward the source, that is, the
U87 MG/factor chamber, through the microchannels where they are nearly
not hindered as the microchannel is filled with the culture medium,
as is shown in Figure 1b. Compared to the 3D culture or in vivo situations, intracellular
connection on the 2D monolayer is much weaker, especially at low cell
densities, which would allow cells to break away from the majority
to display a single-cell migrating mode.

To seed the cells easily
and to control the application of chemical
factors on ECs, the content within the chambers needs to remain separated
until a certain amount of factors was generated. To address this,
the chip was made hydrophobic to prevent microchannels from opening
when the solution was introduced, which was done through a long-time
aging,21 causing the polar groups (mostly
silanol) on the surface generated by plasma washing to condense22 and in turn eliminate hydrogen bonds, as is
shown in Figure 2a.
Consequently, all surfaces within the chip would require extra energy
to be wetted. Because of the micrometer scale, the surface tension
would prevent the liquid from entering the microchannels and separate
the liquid apart (Figure 2b). As is shown in Figure 2b, 10 μg/mL fluorescein sodium was injected into
the main channels to test the effectiveness of this method, confirming
that no solute exchange happened at the interface.

Figure 2 Control of microchannels
through hydrophobic treatment of the surface.
Scale bars represent 100 μm. (a) PDMS surface becomes hydrophobic
after aging eliminates surface hydroxyls. (b–d) Scheme of microchannel control. (b) Air prevents solute exchange
between the main channels, shown by its bright field image with fluorescence
overlay. (c) Remaining air gradually solves into the liquid phase.
Image sample was obtained at 18 h. (d) Remaining air removed by 30–45
min of refrigeration, opening the microchannel.

When the liquid phase consists mostly of pure water,
the amount
of air within the microchannels does not decrease significantly over
time. However, in the case of culture media, the organic solutes make
it easier to wet and can moderately modify the surface hydrophilic.
Thus, the culture medium would gradually invade into the microchannels
and absorb the air in its way, causing a notable decrease in air amount
over time (Figure S2). Approximately at
18 h after culture medium injection, only a small amount of air would
remain, as is shown by the decreased length of air stored in the microchannels
in Figure 2c. At this
point, the remaining air can be completely removed through 30–45
min of refrigeration as air becomes more soluble at low temperatures
and could be completely absorbed into the liquid phase. This would
cause the microchannels to “open”, which allows the
chemical factors to diffuse into the EC channel and form a gradient
to stimulate EC cell migration (Figure 2d).

To test cell viability after refrigeration
and to test their behavior,
EC monoculture was performed with no angiogenic stimulus in which
no significant cell death was observed until approximately 42 h after
seeding (24 h after opening). During this process, despite the absence
of stimulus, multicellular migration of ECs toward the gas–liquid
interface in the microchannels was still observed, mostly in a multicellular
pattern, as is shown in Figure 3a. One possible explanation of this behavior is that the surface
in the microchannels was not occupied when it was first wetted, causing
the ECs to migrate for better nutrition. The shear force generated
by the flow of the culture medium when the liquid phase invaded the
microchannel may also contribute to this phenomenon. Such a migrating
behavior would cause a nonzero background, requiring control groups
for following analyses.

after the opening of microchannels. ECs in angiogenic environment
(left) migrate further than the control group (right), which is more
conspicuous among foremost cells (marked). Fluorescence images after
calcein live staining showed no observable death among migrating cells.

VEGF-A, the main angiogenic factors in this coculture
system, is
naturally secreted by U87 MG. It has been reported that in glioma
cell bulk culture systems, the total VEGF-A concentration undergoes
a dramatic increase within 72 h.23 To apply
a relatively stable migrating stimulus to the ECs, the VEGF-A concentration
should not change greatly within the time of interaction. To achieve
this, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was performed
on supernatant samples obtained from the on-chip U87 MG cell culture
at 6, 12, 24 h and was summarized, as is shown in Figure 3b. The result shows that the
concentration of VEGF-A significantly rises to about 1 ng/mL within
6 h after seeding, about 10-fold compared to the result obtained from
the petri dish at 24 h (0.1 ng/mL), possibly as a result from the
microliter scale volume. The VEGF-A concentration remains on a steady
increase from 6 to 24 h. This indicates that the latter period is
fully available for testing. Considering the time for the microchannels
to open and the potential risk of cell viability after 24 h, the time
for cell interaction was chosen to be 18 to 24 h after seeding.

Diffusion of the chemical factors also largely affects the migration
of the ECs: due to the peptide nature of these factors, it cannot
reach its equilibrium instantly as smaller molecules. Take the example
of VEGF165, the most abundant isoform of VEGF-A with a molecular weight
of 38.2 kDa, whose diffusion coefficient can be estimated from an
empirical formula24  

Substitute T with
37 °C and η with
0.6913 mPa·s, the dynamic viscosity of water at 37 °C. This
generates  

Making an approximation that the factors
can be instantly replenished
or drained at the openings of the microchannel, the spatial distribution
of concentration was determined by simulation. According to Fick’s
first law, the flux is proportional to the gradient of concentration,
so the proportion to original concentration (c/c0) can be used instead. The simulation result
is shown in Figure 3c: the gradient spans over the microchannel within approximately
30 min and becomes nearly uniform in about 1 h, which remains stable.
At 6 h, the final gradient does not deviate much from uniform distribution.
As Fick’s first law and the empirical formula suggest  with c/c0 and x remaining constant, a simulation
was done with 10 μg/mL fluorescein sodium (Figure S3), which reached a consistent result with the previous
simulation: diffusion of chemical factors completes rapidly and the
gradient becomes mostly uniform.

To test the chip’s ability
to reproduce in vivo scenario,
a coculture system with glioma cells, a natural source for angiogenic
factors, was established by loading U87 MG cells into a side channel.
The microchannels were opened at 18 h after seeding, and the EC migration
was observed at 6 h after the opening of microchannels (Figure 3d). To test the viability of
ECs in this coculture system, at the end of observation, 10 nM calcein
solution was injected into the EC channel and the chip was incubated
for 30 min. As is shown in Figure 3d, the displacement of foremost EC cells in the coculture
increases visibly compared to the control group where a nonangiogenic
culture medium was injected instead. The fluorescence image shows
that these migrating cells achieve good viability. This demonstrates
the ability of this in vitro model to simulate EC migration cell in
the glioma cell coculture.

To further examine the migration
process and to find out the impact
of angiogenic factor concentration on cell migration, an assay was
conducted with the culture medium dosed with 0.5, 1, 2 ng/mL VEGF165,
a common isoform of VEGF-A. The cells were observed at an interval
of 3 h. Cell migration tests were performed at different factor concentrations,
where the migrating cells was identified and tracked according to
their location and morphology (Figure S4). Tracing results of migrating foremost cells are shown in Figure S5 and summarized in Figure 4a, where a significant increase
was observed at higher VEGF165 concentrations, which establishes a
positive correlation between EC migration and the factor gradient.
This result reassures the validity of the model.

distance over 0–3 and 3–6 h time span. EC migration
increases significantly at higher VEGF concentrations. (b) Tracking
result of cells in a microchannel, showing cell difference in their

over time were marked with color to visualize the difference in migrating
ability. Scale bars represent 50 μm. (*) p <
0.05, (**) p < 0.01, and (***) p < 0.001.

Apart from the overall increase of migration under
an angiogenic
stimulus, certain cells display a distinct displacement as is marked
in Figure 3d and the
extreme data in Figure 4a, a phenomenon reminiscent of in vivo tip cell migration. In these
cases, the variation of response among individual cells is possibly
magnified by analogy to the in vivo tip-cell selection process, where
the activated cell suppresses the response of nearby cells through
intercellular communication: Binding of VEGF on VEGFR2 upregulates
the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (DLL4). This will activate the NOTCH1
receptor of nearby cells, promoting their VEGFR1 expression, which
competes with the binding to VEGFR2.25 If
an activated cell outcompetes nearby ones in this signaling pathway,
it would exhibit a more distinct migration.

Obvious individual
difference can be observed among cells, which
can be magnified by high VEGF concentrations, which in turn suggests
heterogeneity on migration at the cell level. Interestingly, the foremost
cell is not necessarily the one with highest displacement in a certain
microchannel, as is shown by 3–6 h in the last example of Figure 4b. Such a result
eliminates the possibility that the difference is caused by the factor
concentration alone as the concentration is always higher for foremost
cells. This suggests that the difference in cell activation is related
to their intrinsic properties, which implies that the ECs exhibit
heterogeneity on their susceptibility to angiogenic factors.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed an assaying method
of single EC migration
on an on-chip angiogenesis model. Its validity was proven by reproduction
of the in vivo scenario with glioma cell coculture. It was shown that
the angiogenic effect exerted by the glioma cell causes single cell
migration, as opposed to migration with adjacent cells. By further
testing its reliability by stimulating the EC cells with a series
of VEGF165-dosed culture medium, we confirmed its reliability by showing
that the migrating distance of cells is positively related to the
concentration of factors.

Furthermore, the heterogeneity of
EC cells can be revealed by its
migrating pattern. The difference in susceptibility, which has not
been shown in the previous studies, is shown here as assays of individual
cells can be more easily done within microstructures. The effect of
this heterogeneity is possibly amplified by intercellular communication
described before, resulting in a distinctive migration pattern among
certain cells. As the chip design in this work is similar to previous
angiogenesis studies, results obtained from this method would be comparable
with earlier findings on which future works may eventually unveil
the effect of EC heterogeneity on tip cell selection and migration.

Experimental Section
SU-8 2050 epoxy resist (MicroChem)
was spinned at 1500 rpm onto
a round silicon wafer with 7.62 cm diameter, generating a uniform
photoresist layer of about 120 μm. The wafer was baked at 65
°C for 2 min, 95 °C for 2 min, and then 65 °C for 2
min. The photoresist layer is exposed to ultraviolet light through
the mask in Figure S1b for 2 min. The wafer
was again baked at 65 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 2 min, and
then 65 °C for 2 min and was soaked into the developer solvent
while being stirred until the extra resist are removed. The surface
of the resist is further silylated through gas phase deposition in
a vacuum dryer with 10 μL of trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane
for 1 h.

Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) base and curing agent
(both Sylgard
184, Dow Corning) was mixed at approximately 10:1 (w/w), adequately
stirred, dried in vacuum for 30 min to remove bubbles and solved air,
filled onto the surface of the template, and is baked for 2 h. After
baking, the PDMS layer is disintegrated from the template. Desired
shapes are cut out and holes are punched. The PDMS moieties were later
cleaned under a plasma cleaner for 2 min and fixed onto the glass,
forming the desired channels and microchannels. The chip was then
incubated at 65 °C for at least 36 h to make the surface hydrophobic.

Fluorescein sodium powder (Wako) was added into deionized water,
producing a solution of 10 μg/mL. The solution was injected
into the side channels, and then water was injected into the middle
channel. Since the liquid will not advance in the microchannels, pressure
was added to the surface of chip to force the microchannels to open,
which would cause undesired mixing near the microchannels, resulting
in a nonzero background. Pictures were taken at 15 min and 1 h (equivalent
to ∼70 min and ∼5 h, respectively) upon the opening
of microchannels, where the fluorescence pictures are shown in Figure S3.

Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVECs) and U87 MG cells
(both from Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences) were
respectively chosen as the sample of ECs and glioma cells. These cells
were cultured using the minimum essential medium (MEM) (Corning) with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sijiqing) and 1% Penicillin−Streptomycin
(Corning) upon acquisition and was made into a suspension of about
106 cells/mL before injection.

ELISA kit was obtained
from Abbkine, lot number ABB-KET6033-48T.
The ELISA test was mostly performed according to the manual, except
the supernatant obtained from U87 MG dishes was not diluted due to
the low concentration. Ten microliters of U87 MG cells was injected
into each side channel of the chip. Twenty microliters of sample was
aspirated from each channel to ensure complete collection of VEGF,
respectively, at 6, 12, and 24 h after seeding. The samples were centrifuged
at 1000 g (3,800 rpm) for 20 min. Supernatant was separated and stored
at −20 °C until use.

After the heating described
above, 0.1 mg/mL poly-l-lysine
(PLL) was injected into the main channels and was removed after 15
min to coat the chip surface, which improves cell adhesion. This is
required as the previous heating destroyed the hydroxyl groups located
on the surface, thus causing great difficulty for cells to adhere.
With the complete removal of PLL solution, either by pipetting or
replacing it with the culture medium, HUVEC cells were seeded into
the middle channel. After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, the
U87 MG cell suspension was injected into the side channels. Liquid
seals were added after another 45 min. The chips were later refrigerated
at 4 °C for 30 min to allow the microchannels to open at exactly
18 h after seeding of U87 MG. Induction of significant EC migration
would spontaneously initiate within the following 6 h by the angiogenic
factors secreted by U87 MG and can be easily observed through tracing
of the cells during this period using a reverted microscope. At the
end of the observation, 10 nM calcein-AM (Dojindo) was injected into
the channels and the chip was incubated for 30 min, which will specifically
generate fluorescence within live cells. Cell viability was checked
through the fluorescence signal produced by the cells, which could
be used to determine the validity of the migration data.

The
VEGF165 (PeproTech) powder was diluted to 10 μg/mL using
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Corning) and was further made into
final concentrations of 500, 1000, and 2000 pg/mL with MEM. PLL modification
and HUVEC seeding were the same as described before. The operating
and observing procedures were almost identical to the cell coculture,
except the U87 MG cell suspension was replaced with the respective
solution of VEGF165: At 1 h after seeding, the contents on one side
was replaced by injecting and aspirating 10 μL of medium. The
liquid seal is broken between the side channel and the main channel
to prevent undesired mixing or diffusion, so the concentration of
VEGF165 within the channel was kept constant through the supply from
the liquid seal. The following steps are identical to the U87 MG-induction
test to replicate the result during the coculture. Images were taken
at an interval of 3 h, and cells were identified by morphology and
position, as is shown in Figure S4. The
displacements of foremost migrating cells at these concentrations
are summarized in Figure S5.
