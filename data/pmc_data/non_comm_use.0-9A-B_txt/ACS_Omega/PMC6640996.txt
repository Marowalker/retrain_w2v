Direct
C–H activation of pyromellitic diimide (PMDI) is
reported for the first time. The method avoids cumbersome pathways
involving bromination usually required for further cross-coupling.
Good to excellent yields of mono- and di-substituted PMDI derivatives
can be obtained under optimized reaction conditions. The reaction
scope was also explored, and the materials were characterized with
respect to their thermal, optical, and electronic properties.

Introduction
The formation of Ar–Ar
bonds is of major importance in all
areas of organic chemistry. Traditional synthesis routes for sp2 C–C bond formation rely on Kumada, Neigishi, Stille,
or Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, which require preparation of orgomagnesium-,
organozinc-, organotin-, or organoboron-functionalized monomers, respectively.1−4 This adds extra steps to the synthesis of the molecule under scrutiny.
In the case of Stille cross-couplings, the use of toxic and environmentally
harmful organotin reagents poses additional limitations. One possibility
of alleviating these drawbacks is to form aryl–aryl bonds using
C–H activation, also referred to as direct arylation (DA),
which allows us to access compounds in fewer steps, in less time,
in a more cost-efficient way, and with increased atom economy.5−8 Further benefits arise from the reduced toxicity compared to that
of Stille reactions and increased functional group stability compared
to that of, for example, Grignard compounds, which can be decisive
in large-scale workup, separation, and storage of building blocks.
Since the first reports on DA by Ames and Nakamura,9,10 C–H
activation strategies
have advanced to being one of the most researched topics, with ever
increasing activity and importance. A large number of structures have
been investigated with respect to aromatic C–H activation,
including π-systems such as benzene, thiophene, indole, thiazole,
tetracene, corannulene, or porphyrin.5−8,11,12 The diversity in C–H activation reactions
is obvious, considering the ubiquitous nature of the C–H bonds.
Although most of the π-systems investigated have been electron-rich
structures, electron-deficient skeletons have been much less explored.
Among them, tetrafluorobenzenes, thienopyrrolidones, and benzothiadiazoles
have been reported.13−16 Among the class of rylene diimides, perylene diimides (PDIs) have
been investigated with respect to C–H activation,17−22 and isolated reports dealing with the C–H activation of naphthalene
diimides (NDIs) have been disclosed.23

Herein, we report the DA of N-alkyl-substituted
pyromellitic diimide (PMDI). PMDI-based materials are less investigated
compared with their larger analogues24,25 but are, due
to their simplicity, of particular interest for molecular and organic
electronics and for sensing applications. From a polymer design point
of view, incorporation of aromatic diimides into conjugated polymers
allows n-type materials with low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) levels to be made, enabling efficient electron transport.26−28 However, compared to those on their NDI and PDI analogues, only
a few reports on PMDI-based materials have been disclosed. PMDI compounds
are commonly prefunctionalized via multistep syntheses involving cumbersome
bromination (Scheme 1a).26,28−35

Scheme 1 Pathways for PMDI Functionalization
Thus, omitting bromination not only increases atom economy
but
also reduces the number of steps required to make PMDI-based materials.
To the best of our knowledge, no direct functionalization of PMDI
has been reported. Here, we present a method for C–H activation
of PMDI and the reaction with aromatic halides (Scheme 1b).

Results and Discussion
As a parameter
set to start with, we selected symmetrically substituted N-ethylhexyl PMDI and an excess of 4-bromotoluene (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 DA of PMDI
The reaction was initially
conducted in tetrahydrofuran with Pd2(dba)3,
P(o-anisyl)3, PivOH, and Cs2CO3 as the typical reactants.13,36−38 Although the raw product showed the complete disappearance
of PMDI, an intractable mixture of compounds was obtained, which could
not be characterized sufficiently. We presumed that ring opening of
the PMDI moiety occurred under the reaction conditions used, leading
to the decomposition of PMDI. Fortunately, the use of mesitylene as
the solvent led to fully soluble product mixtures containing 36% asymmetric
4-tolyl-substituted PMDI (monosubstituted compound 2)
and 49% disubstituted target compound 3 (entry 1, Table 1). Mesitylene has
already proven to be a good solvent for the DA of NDI derivatives,
even though the functional groups are different.39,40 To further optimize the reaction conditions to the required level
also for even polycondensation reactions, a detailed parameter screening
was performed. Although temperature changes from 110 to 120 °C
did not lead to remarkable changes in yield (entry 2, Table 1), the reaction proved to be
extremely sensitive to subtle changes of other parameters. Specifically,
the PMDI concentration turned out to be important, with concentrations
of 0.2 M leading to the decomposition of PMDI even in mesitylene.
Good yields of compound 3 (65%) were obtained, with a
concentration of 0.05 M (entries 3 and 4, Table 1).

a All reactions
were performed in
mesitylene.

b The NMR ratio
between the starting
material and products, calculated by 1H NMR. PivOH: pivalic
acid, DMPP: tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)phosphine. Structures of the
catalysts are given in Scheme 3.

The influence
of the ligand in combination with Pd2(dba)3 was
investigated next under increased reaction times (entries
5–9, Table 1). A slightly increased yield of compound 3 (76%) was
obtained with P(o-anisyl)3, which is the
most widely used ligand for DA reactions due to its quite unique behavior.37,41

Increasing the amount of P(o-anisyl)3 from 1 to 2 equiv per Pd center did not lead to improved
catalytic
activity (entries 6 and 9). We also employed a variety of Pd precursors,
ranging from cost-efficient Pd(OAc)2 and its derivatives
and Pd2(dba)3 and its derivatives to highly
reactive Buchwald third-generation catalysts (entries 10–14, Table 1, Schemes 3 and 4).42 All Pd precursors gave good conversion of PMDI
except Pd2(dba-CF3)3, in which case
20% of the PMDI was still present after workup. The best conversion
was obtained with PdG3, with the formation of 88% of 3 (entry 10, Table 1).

Scheme 3 Pd Catalyst and Ligands Used
Scheme 4 Halide Substrates Used
The influence of the base was investigated next (entries
15–25, Table 1). Cs2CO3 is required to achieve good yields;
other carbonates yielded
drastically lower yields of PMDI (entries 15–16, Table 1). Drastically lower yields
also resulted when using pivalate instead of pivalic acid in combination
with Cs2CO3 (entries 17–18, Table 1). We also found the
amount of PivOH to be important for the outcome of the reaction (entries
23–24, Table 1). No reaction was observed in the absence of pivalic acid, with
only Cs2CO3 as the base (entry 25, Table 1). Finally, the catalyst
loading was varied to enable quantitative conversion of PMDI (entries
26−29, Table 1), revealing a strong dependence on the yield of 3.
The best result, with satisfying yields of 95% of 3 and
5% of 2 was obtained with 4 mol % PdG3 (entry 28, Table 1).

The effect
of the position of the methyl group is interesting,
as it causes torsion between the phenyl ring and the PMDI core. Considering
different bromotoluenes, 4-bromotoluene gave the highest yield (entries
1–3, Table 2). However, similar conversions were obtained even for 2- and 3-bromotoluene,
indicating a weak effect of the steric parameters of the substrate.
This can be ascribed to the use of P(o-anisyl)3, which is known to be suitable for cross-coupling of o-bromides.35 The reaction with
bromobenzene also exhibited good catalytic activity (entry 4, Table 2). The less reactive
chlorobenzene, 8, was also tested as a substrate (entry
5, Table 2) without
any loss of activity compared to that of bromobenzene, indicating
good reactivity.

a All reactions were
performed in
mesitylene ([PMDI] = 0.05 M) at 110 °C, additive = 1 equiv PivOH,
base = 3 equiv Cs2CO3, reaction time = 3 days.

b Conversion was calculated by 1H NMR. The structures of the substrates are given in Scheme 3.

Moreover, the electronic effects
of the substituent on the aryl
halide were tested. Compared to that of the model reaction with 4-bromotoluene,
the modification of the para-substituent led to a strongly different
outcome. Although the use of 4-methoxybromobenzene (9) and 4-trifluoromethyl-bromobenzene (11) gave the disubstituted
compound in 24 and 71% yields, respectively, the reaction did not
proceed with 4-cyanobromobenzene (10) (entries 6–8, Table 2). Also, increased
reaction times of up to 16 days did not lead to measurable conversion
of PMDI. Interestingly, this behavior cannot be explained by simply
classifying substituents as electron rich or electron poor, as good
conversion is seen with 11 (entry 8, Table 2) but no reaction occurred with 10 (entry 7, Table 2).

Finally, the coupling of PMDI with halides exhibiting
stronger
electronic modification was investigated. The use of bromopentafluorobenzene 12 only afforded a mixture of starting materials together
with insoluble products that could not be characterized (entry 9, Table 2). The synthetic protocol
was not efficient with heterocycles such as 2-bromopyrimidime (entry
10, Table 2), with
the raw mixture again containing PMDI together with an intractable
mixture of compounds.

Optical absorption of the disubstituted
PMDI derivatives in solution
is characterized by a weak donor–acceptor system, whereby both
the torsional angle between PMDI and the phenyl ring and the electron
rich or deficient nature of the halide are the main parameters governing
donor strength. The most red-shifted charge-transfer band is found
for the disubstituted PMDI with the least torsion and coupled to the
most electron-rich substrate, 9 (see Supporting Information). This trend is also confirmed by cyclic
voltammetry (CV) measurements, wherein a stronger donor increases
the LUMO energy level from −3.52 eV for substrate 11 to −3.36 eV for substrate 9 (see Supporting Information). Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) measurements of some of the crystalline disubstituted
PMDIs showed unconventional behavior, which is strongly dependent
on the position and nature of the substituent on the phenyl ring.
Most surprisingly, disubstituted PMDI made from 1 melted
at 111 °C and subsequently recrystallized at 239 °C during
the first heating cycle, indicating the formation of a different polymorph.
Further heating to the maximum applicable temperature of 300 °C
(for thermogravimetric measurements, see Supporting Information) did not lead to subsequent melting of the recrystallized
material. Accordingly, the cooling trace was entirely featureless.
Moving the methyl group from the para to the meta and ortho positions
weakened this behavior with respect to the ability to recrystallize
during heating. By contrast, the thermal behavior of the disubstituted
PMDIs derived from 7, 9, and 11, included simple melting and crystallization events during heating
and crystallization, respectively (see Supporting Information).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
presented a straightforward and thoroughly
optimized protocol enabling difunctionalization of electron-deficient N,N′-dialkylated PMDI via DA, with
excellent yield. The synthetic methodology makes commonly used bromination
of PMDI precursors redundant and thus shortens the synthetic pathways
to a variety of arylated PMDI derivatives. The near-quantitative formation
of disubstituted PMDI derivatives is a necessary condition for further
elaboration of this protocol toward the quantitative yield required
for polycondensation with dihalides, which might lead to highly simplified
two-step protocols toward efficient n-type copolymers for use in organic
electronics. The initial results regarding copolymerization of PMDI
and 1,4-dibromobenzene indicate that this is possible and also that
optimization is required to increase the molecular weight to an acceptable
level (see Supporting Information).

Experimental
Section
Materials
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma Aldrich
and used without further treatment unless otherwise stated. PMDI was
synthesized according to a previously reported method.43 Pd2(dba-R)3 complexes
were synthesized according to the literature.44

General Procedure for the Model Reaction of PMDI and 4-Bromotoluene
PMDI (20.00 mg, 0.04539 mmol, 1 equiv), 4-bromotoluene (77.64 mg,
0.4539 mmol, 10 equiv), Cs2CO3 (136.18 mg, 44.371
mmol, 3 equiv), PivOH (4.64 mg, 45.4 mmol, 1 equiv), PdG3 (1.34 mg,
1.82 mmol, 4 mol %), and tris(o-methoxyphenyl)phosphine
(1.28 mg, 3.63 mmol, 8 mol %) were charged in a dried vial containing
a stirring bar. The contents of the vial were degased for 30 min.
Then, 0.09 mL of degased mesitylene was added under a N2 atmosphere. The vial was sealed, placed in a preheated oil bath,
and stirred for 40 h at 110 °C. After cooling to RT, the mixture
was filtered through a short silica plug to remove any trace of mesitylene
and then extracted with pure dichloromethane (DCM). After evaporation
of the solvent, the residual material was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy to calculate the mole percentage of products 2 and 3 in the reaction mixture.

The products
could be purified via column chromatography using a mixture of DCM
and i-hexane (3:1).

General Procedure for Screening of the Reaction
Scope
The same procedure that is described above was used,
with an increase
in the reaction time to 3 days and with a PMDI loading of 200 mg instead
of 20 mg.
