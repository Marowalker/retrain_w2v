The use of electronic
cigarettes (E-cig) is popular because of
the perception that they are less addictive and safer compared to
the traditional cigarettes. Nevertheless, there are still harmful
effects associated with chemicals emitted from E-cig. Identifying
the sources of the emitted compounds can be challenging because of
the differences in the design of E-cig devices and the variability
in the composition of E-cig liquids used in these devices. In this
study, the emission profiles from impurity-free E-liquids containing
only propylene glycol and glycerol in various percentage ratios along
with two commercially available E-liquids were evaluated using gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). This study
approach allows the elucidation of the transformation pathways of
the major emitted compounds without the confounding effects of existing
impurities or flavor ingredients added to E-liquids. Analysis of the
vapor phases of E-cig emissions detected toxicants such as acetaldehyde,
acrolein, benzaldehyde, as well as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
and xylene (BTEX) compounds. The amount of glycerol in the E-liquids
has a major effect on the concentration of these hazardous compounds
emitted because the concentration of these chemicals increased with
increasing glycerol percentage in the E-liquid. Acetaldehyde and acrolein
increased by 175-fold and 28-fold, respectively, when the glycerol
composition was increased from 0 to 80%. Benzaldehyde, naphthalene,
diphenyl ether, and glycerol along with menthol and nicotine that
were present in the commercial E-liquids were also detected in the
aerosol condensates. The cascade impactor data on the distribution
of the nicotine and menthol in different size fractions from >2.5
to <2.5 μm allow the estimates of the extent of toxicant
deposition in different parts of the pulmonary system including the
oropharynx region, the trachea as well as inside the alveoli and bronchioles.
In summary, users of E-cig are exposed to harmful chemicals even if
the E-liquids contain only propylene glycol and glycerol without flavorings,
nicotine, or impurities. Furthermore, this study shows that E-liquids
containing higher percentages of glycerol will produce higher levels
of toxicants compared to E-liquids with similar percentages of propylene
glycol. This finding has important implications to E-cigarette vendors
and manufacturers, consumers, and regulatory agencies.

Introduction
Electronic
cigarettes (E-cig) are battery-powered smoking devices
that create aerosol containing nicotine and flavoring agents by heating
E-liquids. Currently, E-cig is very popular among youth and young
adults, with marked increase among middle and high school students.1 Popularity of E-cig is due to various reasons
and perceptions: (1) E-cig is safer compared to conventional cigarettes
because E-liquids are composed of different proportions of propylene
glycol (PG), glycerol, and flavoring substances that are classified
as “Generally Recognized As Safe” (GRAS) by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration, that is, FDA;2 (2) E-cig deliver less nicotine and other smoke-related toxins;3 (3) E-liquids come in various flavors that are
appealing to the youth;4 and (4) E-cig
use may aid in cessation of smoking.5 Apparently,
E-cig use has now become the most commonly used form of tobacco smoking
in the U.S., with 3.7% of adults (approximately 9 million) being regular
users of E-cig.6

Existing E-cig research
data are still relatively less comprehensive
compared to that of conventional cigarette smoke in which more than
6500 compounds7 with 150 harmful or potentially
harmful substances8 and more than 50 known
carcinogens9 have been confirmed. The toxicants
produced in the mainstream E-cig vapor include nicotine, glycols,
carbonyls, including dicarbonyls and hydroxycarbonyls, volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, tobacco-specific
nitrosamines, and metals.10−13 Many of these substances are known toxins, including
carcinogens such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.14 The types and concentrations of chemical constituents produced
in the E-cig vapor depend on the formulation and flavor of the E-liquids,
and the voltage used.14,15

Toxicants produced from
heating the E-liquids are found in the
vapor phase, particulate phase, or both. A vast majority of studies
investigating the E-cig vapor phase have used gas chromatography coupled
with mass spectrometry (GC–MS). In particulate phase analysis,
the Harvard compact cascade impactor,15 the Cambridge filter pads and glass fiber filter pads techniques
have been used to collect the total particulate matter for GC–MS
analysis.16 However, the particulate analysis
of filter pads does not yield information on the size-dependent distribution
of different E-cig particulate phase components. Many studies on the
analysis of E-cig vapor constituents are related to investigating
the effects of flavoring agents on the formation of E-cig vapor constituents.
Because there are thousands of different brands of E-liquids with
minor levels of flavor ingredients and various percentages of glycerol
and PG, it is nearly impossible to study all of them with regard to
their chemical transformation and distribution between the gas and
particulate phases. Therefore, it is the goal of this study to probe
the E-cig emission profiles based on the ratio of the two major E-liquid
components, namely, glycerol and PG, and menthol, one of the most
popular E-liquid flavors. This research approach will provide a better
understanding of E-cig emission characteristics for many commercially
available E-liquid products.

Among the various E-liquid flavors,
menthol is one of the most
popular flavors, especially among young adults4 and women.17 FDA regulates various flavoring
agents such as grape, clove, coffee, and cinnamon in tobacco except
for the menthol flavoring. Even though menthol cigarettes are used
as a starter product among youths,18 menthol
remains an unregulated tobacco flavoring agent.19 Thus, it is important to investigate the chemical compounds
produced from vaping of E-liquids containing menthol. This study identified
the compounds present in the vapor phase of E-cig using Fourier-transform
infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and GC–MS. The effects of addition
of menthol into the PG and glycerol base composition of E-liquids
were studied and compared to the commercial brand of zero nicotine
menthol-containing E-liquid. In addition, the total particulate phase
of the E-cig vapor was separated by size using a Sioutas cascade impactor
followed by GC–MS analysis to determine the concentrations
of E-cig vapor constituents in different size-dependent particulate
fractions.

Results and Discussion
Mist Emitted from E-Cigarette
E-liquids
are a mixture
of PG and glycerol at the various volume percentage ratios of 10:90,
20:80, 50:50, and 80:20 with flavoring additives and may or may not
contain nicotine. The visible puff or mist emitted from the E-cig
is composed of the vapor and aerosol phases that are distributed and
deposited in the respiratory system during inhalation. A previous
study has reported the concentration range of 0.161–0.477 mg/m3 for glycerol and 53–175 mg/m3 for PG in
the vapor phase of E-cig emission.13,20,21 These two major components of E-liquids were found
predominantly in the aerosol phase based on the comparison of both
the GC–MS data of aerosols collected with the cascade impactor
and the vapor phase samples in the Tedlar bags. This is consistent
with the low vapor pressures of glycerol and PG due to the strong
intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions within the fine aerosol
droplets. The infrared spectral data of E-cig emission based on their
different blend ratios show that PG was found at higher levels than
glycerol, even when the PG was present at only 20% in the mixture.
Short exposure to PG mist has been reported to cause acute effects
on the ocular and pulmonary system.22 Moreover,
the PG and glycerol are converted to carcinogenic carbonyl compounds
upon heating via the atomizer in the E-cig (Figures 1 and 2).

percentage ratios of glycerol (VG) and PG. All values were calculated
relative to 100% PG. (A) In the plot for carbonyl compounds, the acetaldehyde

Analysis of the Vapor Phase
Profile by GC–MS
The VOCs observed in GC–MS
results of the E-cig mist include
mostly compounds with two or three carbon atoms but can also include
larger molecular weight compounds like toluene and styrene. The harmful
or potentially harmful VOCs include formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and
acrolein, which are some of the toxic carbonyl compounds formed by
the thermally assisted reactions of PG and glycerol23−25 that are detected
in the vapor phase. The analysis of the E-cig vapor phase as a function
of the ratio of PG to glycerol in the E-liquids shows that most VOCs
were found to be at higher concentrations as the glycerol content
in the E-liquid based is increased (Figure 1). Figure 1A shows a 28-fold increase in acrolein concentration
as the glycerol is increased from 0 to 80%, which can be explained
by the dehydration reaction of the glycerol as shown in Figure 2B. A similar trend was reported
by Wang et al.26 that the acrolein level
increased in the E-cig emission as the E-liquid composition was changed
from pure PG to 1:1 VG/PG mixture and finally to pure glycerol at
the E-cig temperatures of 270 and 318 °C. An important distinction
of this study is that the carbonyl analysis was carried out on the
aerosol samples using DNPH derivatization with subsequent liquid chromatography
analysis and ultraviolet-diode array detection compared to the current
study of the vapor phase analysis of all VOCs using GC–MS over
a broader range of VG/PG ratios for the E-liquids. The subsequent
reaction of acrolein involves hydrogenation and cleavage to form formaldehyde
and ethylene. This glycerol-based pathway for formaldehyde formation
is more significant than the PG-based pathway because the experimental
data based on extracted ion chromatogram at the m/z value of 30 for GC–MS analysis show that
formaldehyde, with molecular mass of 30 amu, was found in the E-cig
emissions from E-liquids with 80% glycerol and 20% PG. This important
observation underscores the fact that “cloud chasers”
who favor the use of E-liquids with a high glycerol composition are
at a greater risk of developing adverse health effects due to the
higher exposures to acrolein and formaldehyde. Acrolein is considered
by the US Environmental Protection Agency27 as a hazardous air pollutant that can cause intense irritation of
the nasal cavity, cytotoxicity in airways, and increased mucus secretion
and a risk factor for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.28,29

In fact, many adverse health effects on the respiratory, gastrointestinal,
cardiovascular, neurological, and immune systems including exacerbation
of pre-existing conditions have been attributed to E-cig, some of
which are similar to effects seen with tobacco smoking.30−32 According to CDC and NIOSH, the revised immediately dangerous to
life or health (IDLH) concentrations for acrolein based on acute inhalation
toxicity in human is 2 ppm or 5 mg/m3, whereas for acetaldehyde,
the IDLH concentration is 2000 ppm based on data in animals. Although
the current study shows that the acrolein concentration emitted for
the E-liquid of 80% glycerol and 20% PG is 0.68 mg/m3,
which is below the IDLH level, it is above the permissible exposure
level (PEL) of OSHA at 0.1 mg/m3. Besides the IDLH and
PEL values that are associated with the protection of industrial workers,
the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) can also be used
to assess the toxicity of E-cig emission. For acrolein, the LOAEL
for inhalation reference dose is 0.9 mg/m3 (0.4 ppm),33 which is slightly above the measured level at
0.68 mg/m3 for the 80% VG/20% PG E-liquid. The International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has also classified benzene and
formaldehyde as a group 1 or known human carcinogen and acetaldehyde
a group 2B or a possible carcinogen for humans.34 For benzene, the estimate of carcinogenic risk from inhalation
exposure is in the range of 2.2 × 10–6 to 7.8
× 10–6 for the increase in the lifetime risk
of an individual who is exposed for a lifetime to 1 μg/m3 benzene in air.35 Based on the
measured benzene concentration of 68 ± 5 μg/m3 for the E-cig emission of the 80% VG/20% PG E-liquid, the cancer
risk is approximately 1 in 10 000.

The GC–MS results
on the study of the emissions based on
E-liquids with different VG/PG ratios also allow the reaction pathways
of the VOCs from the E-cig emissions to be proposed. The expanded
and revised schematic diagrams of reaction pathways, compared to those
of Bekki and co-workers,24 include additional
VOCs generated from PG and glycerol in E-cig emissions that are shown
in Figure 2A,B, respectively.
The schematic diagrams show reaction pathways consistent with the
detection of specific compounds emitted from the E-cig device filled
with only the glycerol/PG solvent mixture. As seen in Figures 1 and 2, the E-cig vapor produced from just the base liquid (without any
flavoring agent or nicotine) contains, in addition to acrolein, a
number of potentially harmful compounds including acetone, benzaldehyde,
methacrolein, acetaldehyde, 2-propenol, as well as benzene, toluene,
ethylbenzene, and xylene, which are collectively referred to as “BTEX”
compounds. Among these detected compounds, the concentration of acetaldehyde
increases most significantly by 175-fold as the concentration of glycerol
is increased from 0 to 80% in the E-liquid. This implies that the
formation of acetaldehyde is greatly influenced by the degradation
of glycerol rather than PG. This deduction is consistent with our
proposed reaction pathways for PG (Figure 2A) and glycerol (Figure 2B) because the GC–MS data show not
only the presence of glycerol-derived acrolein, which is the precursor
of acetaldehyde, but also the absence of methylglyoxal, an alternate
precursor of acetaldehyde produced via the PG pathway. Although it
is inferred that glycerol degradation contributes to elevated levels
of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, it is important to mention that
they have been determined to be present in E-liquids at the concentration
ranges of 0.114–2.92 μg/g for formaldehyde and 0.040–10.2
μg/g for acetaldehyde.36

The
presence of both 2-propenol and acetone in the emissions also
suggests the occurrence of the tautomerization reaction between the
enol and keto forms (Figure 2A,B) with the equilibrium favoring the formation of acetone,
which was found at 21–44 times the concentrations of 2-propenol
in the vapor phase emissions of E-liquids with the various ratios
of glycerol to PG. The 2-propenol and acetone tautomers can also be
formed indirectly via the intermediate product of isopropanol for
reaction pathways of either PG or glycerol. The similar relative concentration
ratios of acetone and 2-propenol (i.e., the comparison of vapors for
E-liquids of 80% VG/20% PG to 100% PG) of 12.4 and 11.9, respectively,
further corroborate the mechanism for the formation of these two compounds
via tautomerization in the reaction pathways for glycerol and PG.
As shown in Figure 2A,B, the hydrogenation of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde leads to
the formation of methanol and ethanol, respectively. Ethanol is the
VOC found at the highest concentration in the emissions of E-cig for
various E-liquid formulations. The measured concentrations of ethanol
in the vapor phase are highly variable and dependent on the sampling
conditions because ethanol vapor can be absorbed into the aerosol
droplets and undergoes a dynamic partition equilibrium between the
vapor and aerosol phases. In general, the gaseous ethanol concentration
decreases as a function of time as the E-cig mist is cooled to ambient
temperature, favoring ethanol condensation and absorption into the
aerosol phase or deposition onto the surface inside the Tedlar bag.
For the E-liquid of 80% glycerol and 20% PG, the vapor phase concentration
of ethanol was determined to be 28.6 mg/m3 or 15.2 ppm.
The measured ethanol concentration would likely be larger if the E-cig
device can be interfaced directly to the GC–MS system with
cryogenic pre-concentration for immediate analysis of VOCs in the
emissions.

Most studies focus on the adverse health effects
caused by the
flavoring agents and nicotine in the E-liquid, but the root of the
problem stems from the formulation of PG and glycerol as solvents
or the major components in the E-liquid. Figure 1B shows the increase of the relative concentrations
of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) as
the glycerol percentage increases in the VG/PG mixtures. Both methanol
and ethanol were also reported in other prior studies37 as byproducts of the oxidation and thermal decomposition
of glycerol in the E-liquid. The very high levels of ethanol in E-cig
emissions are of concern because of its intoxicating effect and tendency
to affect mental acuity. It is not known to what extent the absorption
of ethanol into blood via the inhalation pathway will accentuate the
inebriation due to drinking alcohols. MVK was formed via the dehydrogenation
reaction of acetaldehyde and ethylene.

The reaction products
shown in Figure 2 have
relatively high volatility and are
easily detected in the vapor phase of E-cig emissions by GC–MS.
It is important to note that the schematic diagrams of vapor phase
reaction pathways are complementary to those based on E-cig aerosol
analysis using the nuclear magnetic resonance technique. A detailed
account of the formation of polar compounds found in the aerosol phase
has been reported by Jensen et al.38 and
Strongin.39 These compounds existing predominantly
in the aerosol phase include PG hemiformal, glycerol hemiformal, glycidol,
dihydroxyacetone, acetol, acrolein, acetaldehyde, formic acid, and
allyl alcohol. The reaction pathways for vapor phase and aerosol phase
are intimately connected. For example, acetol or hydroxyacetone can
be converted into formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in the glycerol reaction
pathway. Likewise, acetaldehyde is converted into acrolein.38

Among the VOCs plotted in Figure 1A–C, the increase in
the relative concentrations
of aromatic or BTEX compounds emitted is significantly smaller than
those of the carbonyl compounds and alcohols. This can be explained
by the fact that the reaction pathways for the formation of aromatic
hydrocarbons involves more intermediate steps compared to the formation
of carbonyls and alcohols. Therefore, the effect of increasing the
glycerol percentage 8-fold from 10 to 80% glycerol in the E-liquid
mixture was relatively diluted or smaller for affecting the concentrations
of the aromatic hydrocarbons or BTEX compounds compared to the alcohols
and carbonyl compounds. Benzene is formed by successive reactions
of propylene, ethylene, and acetylene to form benzene initially via
1,3-butadiene as an important reaction intermediate. Detailed mechanisms
for the formation of benzene from 1,3-butadiene, which was detected
in the E-cig emissions for experiments using E-liquids of different
VG/PG ratios, have been described previously for experiments based
on thermally assisted aromatization,44 kinetic
modeling and reactor experiments under the conditions of 0.15% 1,3-butadiene
and 0.4125–3.35% oxygen in nitrogen,45 and molecular beam studies of ethynyl radicals and 1,3-butadiene
at the collision energy of 45.4 ± 2.1 kJ/mol.46 Propylene, ethylene, acetylene, and methane, which play
important roles in the formation of benzene and alkyl aromatics, were
observed by FTIR or GC–MS in this study, especially at high
power settings of E-cig devices when higher concentrations were observed.
An alternate pathway for the formation of benzene in E-cig emissions
based on the E-liquids containing benzoic acid and benzaldehyde additives
was proposed by Pankow et al.47 Three benzene
formation mechanisms cited include the decarboxylation of benzoic
acid, the oxidation and subsequent decarboxylation of benzaldehyde,
and the disproportionation of benzaldehyde to form benzyl alcohol
and benzoic acid that is decarboxylated to form benzene. The subsequent
reactions of benzene with methanol, ethanol, and formaldehyde eventually
lead to the formation of toluene and xylenes, ethylbenzene, and benzaldehyde,
respectively. Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene results in the formation
of styrene.

Acetaldehyde, acetone, acrolein, ethanol, benzene,
toluene, xylene,
and styrene that were detected in the vapor phase of this study were
also reported in the findings of Herrington and Myers43 using the thermal desorption tube method. Benzaldehyde
was detected by GC–MS in both the vapor phase and the different
size fractions of aerosol phase collected with Sioutas cascade impactor.
Glycerol, PG, and nicotine were detected in the aerosol phase via
the GC–MS analysis of cascade impactor samples. These compounds
with high polarity exist primarily in the aerosol phase and tend to
condense inside the sample tubings and Tedlar bags. Furthermore, they
do not show good recovery via the cryogenically cooled glass bead
and Tenax TA traps in the preconcentrator because of their very high
enthalpies of vaporization relative to other VOCs. Consequently, they
are not observed in the GC–MS analysis and their absence facilitates
the analysis of low-level VOCs with similar retention times to these
three major constituents of E-cig emissions.

Analysis of the Vapor Phase
Profile by FTIR
The GC–MS
analysis of E-cig emissions has yielded useful information on the
emission profile of VOCs that include C3–C8 hydrocarbons and oxygenated VOCs primarily. The use of GC–MS
with a cryogenic pre-concentration technique also allows the quantitative
analysis of toxic carbonyl compounds and flavor additives down to
the detection limits of 1–10 parts-per-billion by volume (ppbv)
in the vapor phase of E-cig emissions. Unfortunately, the GC–MS
method suffers from the drawbacks of analyte condensation inside sampling
bags or analyte absorption into the aerosol phase prior to sample
analysis. Furthermore, GC–MS analysis of small molecules with
molecular mass smaller than 35 amu is challenging because of the limitation
of the cryogenic pre-concentrator or the background interference of
the constituents of air. Hence, the emissions of smaller molecules
including CO2, CO, methane, ethane, ethylene, methanol,
ethanol, and formaldehyde emitted from an E-cig device operated at
500 °F (260 °C) and 600 °F (316 °C) were analyzed
by an FTIR spectrometer (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Comparison of FTIR spectra of E-cigarette emissions with
reference
standards. (A) E-cig vapor spectra at 500 and 600 °F are overlaid
with reference spectra of PG, methanol, and ethanol in the fingerprinting
region; (B) E-cig vapor spectra at 500 and 600 °F are overlaid
with the reference spectra of ethanol in the vapor and liquid phases
at the region of 2800–3600 cm–1; (C) E-cig
vapor spectra at 500 and 600 °F are overlaid with the reference
spectrum of carbon monoxide in the 2090–2220 cm–1 region; (D) E-cig vapor spectrum acquired at E-cig power of 60 W
is overlaid with the formaldehyde reference spectrum at 2745–2795
cm–1.

Figure 3A shows
the overlay of the infrared reference spectra of ethanol, PG, and
methanol with the sample spectra of E-cig emissions at 500 and 600
°F in the fingerprinting region of 800–1200 cm–1. The prominent spectral features of ethanol at the 1080, 1030, and
890 cm–1 in Figure 3A and 2955 cm–1 in Figure 3B shows that the ethanol signal
are easily recognizable by comparing them to those in the reference
spectra. The sample spectra in Figure 3B show the existence of ethanol as free gas phase molecules
in the C–H stretch band at 3000 cm–1 and
as the aerosol-bound liquid phase constituent at 3360 cm–1. The reference spectra of ethanol in both gas and liquid phases
are overlaid with the sample spectra to corroborate the partition
of ethanol in both phases at the E-cig setting of 500 and 600 °F.
The liquid phase spectrum of ethanol has the broad hydrogen-bonding
O–H band but not the sharp peaks of the C–H stretch
band, whereas the gas phase ethanol spectrum shows the opposite description.
It is important to note that the O–H vibrational band in Figure 3B is the composite
signal of ethanol and other less volatile alcohols including PG and
glycerol that exist in the aerosol phase. The C–H band is due
to the spectral overlap of ethanol and other VOCs including alcohols
like methanol, isopropanol, and 2-propenol that have the C–H
covalent bonds.

The average concentrations of ethanol at 500
and 600 °F correspond
to the 1236 ± 361 and 3250 ± 449 mg/m3, respectively.
These concentration values are significantly higher than those measured
by GC–MS because the E-cig emissions were generated for immediate
analysis by the FTIR method to avoid the condensation of ethanol vapor
and its absorption into the aerosol phase which was the case in GC–MS
analysis that was performed using samples that were allowed to cool
for 30 min in the Tedlar bags after the E-cig vaping. The waiting
period allowed the condensation and agglomeration of glycerol and
PG in the aerosol particles and therefore prevent their being drawn
into the preconcentrator and circumvent the need for the use of excessively
high desorption temperature or heating period for the Tenax TA trap
and their very intense GC–MS signals that affect the ability
to detect or quantify analytes that are at least 100-fold lower in
concentrations. The high levels of ethanol can be attributed to the
degradation of the E-liquid mixture of glycerol and PG as well as
the presence of ethanol as a component of E-liquids. Regardless of
whether ethanol is used as a solvent for flavorants or other additives
in E-liquids, it is important to determine ethanol concentration because
of its inebriating effect or possible conversion into acetaldehyde
that can induce adverse health effects. Analysis of ethanol in different
E-liquids has been reported by various groups.36,43,48 Varlet et al. reported that 30 of the 42
commercial nicotine-containing E-liquids contained ethanol in the
range of 6–3675 μg/g.36 Out
of 37 nicotine-containing E-liquids analyzed, Poklis et al. reported
that two samples contained ethanol concentrations > 100 mg/mL,
five
samples contained 10–100 mg/mL ethanol, and 17 samples contained
0.05–1.0 mg/mL ethanol.48 Therefore,
the presence of ethanol in commercial E-liquids could contribute to
the ethanol in the gas phase by vaporization. In addition, it is surmised
that the thermal degradation of glycerol must have played an important
role in producing ethanol because the ethanol vapor concentration,
as measured by GC–MS, increased by 4.5-fold for the 80%/20%
VG/PG mixture relative to the 0%/100% VG/PG mixture. This suggests
that glycerol is capable of further contributing to the thermally
assisted production of ethanol above the level attributed to the volatilization
of ethanol as an impurity in the E-liquids.

Figure 3C shows
the presence of CO at the level of 7.78 ± 0.06 ppmv or 8.91 ±
0.07 mg/m3 for the 600 °F emission experiment. This
CO value is smaller than the value reported in a recent article that
gave the measured CO concentration range of 76.7–2386.9 mg/m3 for a variety of atomizer filaments, coil configurations,
and surface areas at 125 W in sub-Ohm E-cig devices.41 The CO concentration of 943.7 mg/m3 or 40 480
ppmv for the 125 W experiment with a nickel coil is also higher than
the CO value of 34.6 ± 1.0 ppmv or 39.6 ± 1.1 mg/m3 for the analysis obtained at E-cig power of 60 W using a Kanthal
coil. These CO concentrations in each puff are higher than the National
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of CO at 35 ppm for the averaging
time period of 1 h. Therefore, it is likely that the indoor level
of CO in buildings with no restriction on E-cig puffing may exceed
the NAAQS level depending on the setting, the number of vapers, and
the puff frequency and duration.

Figure 3D shows
the presence of formaldehyde at the level of 22.7 ± 2.9 ppmv
or 27.9 ± 3.6 mg/m3 in the E-cig emission at the maximum
power setting of 60 W. The 60 W power setting was used to evaluate
the maximum emission exposure of vapers who use the sub-Ohm devices
(SODs) at high power levels. Furthermore, the data obtained using
the E-cig power of 60 W also allow comparison to a recently published
FTIR study of SODs at power levels ranging from 25 to 175 W.41 According to Misthub.com,49 the use of 50
W gives “a nice cool vape with good flavor” and 60 W
will yield “massive plumes of vapor with delightful flavor.”
For the emission measurement using the temperature setting mode at
600 °F, the formaldehyde concentration was found to be 0.374
± 0.157 ppmv or 0.459 ± 0.193 mg/m3, which is
near the detection limit of the FTIR method. At the temperature setting
of 500 °F, the formaldehyde level was below the FTIR detection
limit. Therefore, the results support previous assertion that as the
power setting is increased to achieve a higher vaping temperature,
formaldehyde will be formed at higher concentrations.50,51 Ogunwale et al. reported the formaldehyde concentration of 8.2–40.4
mg/m3 based on an E-cig power setting of 9.5 W for 10 puffs
with the puff volume of 91 mL.52 The decarbonylation
reaction of formaldehyde could explain the formation of carbon monoxide
according to a previous study of the decomposition of aldehydes on
palladium.53 It is possible that similar
decomposition could take place on the nickel filament used in the
E-cig device because both nickel and palladium are dehydrogenation
catalysts that belong to group VIII in the Periodic Table.

Aerosol
Profile
The aerosol phase of E-cig was sampled
with the Sioutas cascade impactor (SKC Inc. Eighty Four, PA) where
a series of five filter stages, designated as the A (inlet end), B,
C, D, and L (outlet end), fractionate the aerosol particles according
to sizes of >2.5, 1.0–2.5, 0.50–1.00, 0.25–0.50,
and <0.25 μm, respectively. Aerosol particles that are larger
than the mass median aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm are usually
deposited in the oropharynx region of the mouth, particles in the
range of 5–10 μm will be deposited in the central airway
of the respiratory system, and particles less than 5 μm can
reach the bronchioles and alveoli which are considered as the smallest
airways in pulmonary system.54 However,
multiple processes such as aerosol cooling, evaporation/condensation,
and coalescence of aerosol droplets can occur in the oral cavity and
alter the dynamics of the inhaled aerosol. This can impact the distribution,
deposition, and transfer of the aerosol within the respiratory system.55 The main constituents of the E-cig aerosol are
polar compounds with minimal volatility that include glycerol and
PG. Besides glycerol and PG that are originally in the E-liquids,
other compounds like benzaldehyde, diphenyl ether, diethyl phthalate,
and naphthalene were detected in the filters from stages A, B, C,
and D that fractionate particles ranging from >2.5 to 0.25–0.5
μm. The fairly uniform concentrations of these compounds in
different filters suggest that they were likely formed via condensation
induced by the adiabatic cooling of the aerosols as they experience
pressure changes while passing through the narrow slits of the cascade
impactor at the pumping speed of 9.0 L/min.56 Glycerol and diphenyl ether were also present in the outlet filter
L, which fractionates the particulate size fraction of <0.25 μm,
suggesting that these components will likely pass through the smallest
airways of the respiratory system.

Diethyl phthalate is commonly
used as a plasticizer for manufacturing polymer materials. It could
have been released via the thermal degradation of plastic components
used in the E-cig device. The thermal degradation most likely occurred
on the plastic cover attached on top of the heating coil in the atomizer
because the heat generated at the coil would accelerate the release
of diethyl phthalate or other plastic additives. Naphthalene has previously
been reported by Margham et al.57 as detectable
in E-cig emissions at 5.01 ± 1.2 ng/puff for puffs 1–100
and 5.87 ± 0.84 ng/puff for puffs 101–200, but these levels
are statistically indistinguishable from the method blank emissions.
A later publication58 shows that naphthalene
was determined to be present in various E-liquid products at 4.24–32.8
ng/mL and quantified as 1.79–3.07 ng/mL-puff in the E-cig emissions.
The detection of naphthalene, a group 2B or possible human carcinogen,
in the cascade impactor analysis of E-cig aerosol emissions shows
that naphthalene was produced in vaping because the high purity PG
and glycerol used to prepare the E-liquid were analyzed and did not
show the presence of naphthalene. Therefore, it will be important
to investigate if the formation of naphthalene takes place via the
reaction of benzene and either 1,3-butadiene or acetylene.

Diphenyl
ether could have resulted from the thermal degradation
of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that is used as a flame
retardant coating on plastic materials in the E-cig atomizers and
protective casing. Chung and co-workers59 reported finding PBDEs in E-cig aerosol and the amounts vary with
the brand of E-cig. It is possible that reductive debromination of
PBDEs on the metallic heating coil of the E-cig device has resulted
in the production of diphenyl ether because it has been reported that
iron can catalyze the conversion of BDE-209 or decabrominated diphenyl
ether to mono- to tribromo diphenyl ethers.60 Except for glycerol, none of the other four aerosol compounds detected
on the filters increased in concentration when the ratio of glycerol
to propylene glycerol was increased. However, when the glycerol in
the E-liquid was increased to 80%, the amount of benzaldehyde in the
vapor phase increased sharply by about 10-fold.

Menthol Flavoring
and Nicotine
Two commercially available
E-liquid products named Hangsen Menthol, one without nicotine and
the other with 18 mg nicotine/mL, are plotted as column charts of
VOCs emitted from E-cig in Figure 4. Because both Hangsen Menthol products are based on
10% VG/90% PG E-liquid formulation, the variation of their VOC concentrations
compared to those of the 10% VG/90% PG E-liquid base could be attributed
to menthol and/or nicotine. Figure 4 shows that the concentrations of acetone, ethanol,
and isopropanol are increased about 4-fold (i.e., relative concentrations
of greater than 4 on the Y-axis) in the menthol-containing
E-liquids compared to the corresponding measurements for the 10% VG/90%
PG E-liquid base. For the aromatic compounds, Figure 4 shows that there is not much difference
in their concentrations whether the E-liquids contain menthol or nicotine
and their relative concentrations are clustered in the narrow range
of 0.8–1.3 around the horizontal line at 1.0 and are unaffected
by the VG/PG ratio. For acetone, the presence of menthol alone contributed
to its 4.7-fold increase, whereas the addition of both menthol and
nicotine to the E-liquid contributed to an 8.3-fold increase. Isopropanol
was increased 6.5-fold with the addition of menthol alone, but the
increase dropped to 3.5-fold for the E-liquid with both menthol and
nicotine. Menthol also caused a smaller increase in the amount of
2-propenol in the vapor phase. Acetaldehyde concentration was found
to decrease for E-liquid with only menthol to the E-liquid but increased
by 2.7-fold for the E-liquid with both menthol and nicotine.

Figure 4 Relative concentrations
of VOCs emitted from E-cig using menthol-containing
E-liquids with 0 and 18 mg nicotine/mL, respectively. The relative
concentration ratios of emitted VOCs were based on the comparison
of vapor phase constituents from Hangsen Menthol and the E-liquid
base that are 10% VG/90% PG. The horizontal line at 1.0 in the three
charts represents the reference level above which the Hangsen Menthol
VOCs are increased and below which the VOCs are decreased relative
to the E-liquid base. The GC–MS analysis shows the menthol
concentrations of 3.70 ± 0.16 and 3.10 ± 0.27 mg/mL for
the Hangsen Menthol without and with nicotine, respectively.

Menthol is detected in the aerosol phase as opposed
to the gas
phase because of its high boiling point of 214.6 °C and relatively
high enthalpy of vaporization of 56.6 kJ/mol. The distribution of
menthol in the various size fractions of the aerosol phase was measured
by the Sioutas cascade impactor. The menthol distribution in the E-liquid
without nicotine is reported as 6% for the A-filter, 5% for the B-filter,
7% for the C-filter, 67% for the D-filter, and 15% for the L-filter.
For the E-liquid with 18 mg/mL nicotine, the menthol distribution
is similar with values of 7% for the A-filter, 7% for the B-filter,
13% for the C-filter, 57% for the D-filter, and 16% for the L-filter.
This distribution shows that a large proportion or 82–85% (i.e.,
sum of D- and L-filter contribution) of the emitted menthol can permeate
as far as the smallest airways based on their small aerosol particle
sizes of less than 0.25 μm. According to Yerger,61 menthol acts as a local anesthetic that can
mask the harsh taste of tobacco smoke as well as modulates the effects
of nicotine in ways that allow tobacco companies to adjust the delivery
of both to maximize nicotine addictive effects. The remaining 18%
of the emitted menthol that was retained in A, B, and C filters showed
that menthol can be deposited in the mouth and throughout the pulmonary
system. Therefore, it presents a soothing effect throughout, masking
any unpleasant sensation of vaping and allowing individuals to tolerate
long periods of vaping.

Nicotine from a 12-puff sample was deposited
in all the filters
of the Sioutas cascade impactor. Its percentage distribution is measured
as 12% for the A-filter, 11% for the B-filter, 42% for the C-filter,
1% for D-filter, and 34% for L-filter. This distribution shows that
nicotine is mostly found in the two size fractions of 0.50–1.0
and <0.25 μm for the C-filter and L-filter, respectively.
This means that a large proportion of the nicotine can be deposited
in the bronchioles and alveoli. While no nicotine was detected in
the zero-nicotine commercial Hangsen Menthol, the nicotine concentration
in the Hangsen Menthol E-liquid marked to contain 18 mg/mL nicotine
by the manufacturer actually has 20.3 ± 0.52 mg/mL of nicotine.
Using the previously published average E-liquid consumption rate of
9.29 ± 0.24 mg/puff62 and either the
measured or labeled concentrations of E-liquid constituents like nicotine
or menthol, one can estimate the mass of a given constituent per puff
in a specific aerosol size fraction. Based on the sampling conditions
of the Sioutas cascade impactor, one puff of E-cig aerosol emission
was found to contain 15.3 μg nicotine and 2.3 μg menthol
in the smallest aerosol size fraction of <0.25 μm. Future
work on the E-cig aerosol study will need to investigate the role
of the airflow rate of E-cig devices. The airflow rate has been shown
to modulate the toxicant profiles and the rate of E-liquid consumption.63

E-liquids are generally produced without
strict industry guidelines
and regulations with regards to amounts of flavorings and nicotine.
This 12.8% discrepancy in the nicotine concentration (i.e., measured
value of 20.3 mg/mL compared to the labeled value of 18 mg/mL) can
be attributed to the E-liquid being manufactured in local facilities
where there is a lack of rigorous quality control, sophisticated production
equipment, or trained professionals, resulting in the mislabeling
of nicotine content in the E-liquids. The accurate labeling of nicotine
concentration in cigarette products is of paramount importance because
nicotine is a highly addictive and psychoactive compound.64 Many users of E-cig rely on the accurate labeling
of nicotine content in the E-liquid as a guide in an effort to quit
smoking traditional cigarettes. The discrepancy in labeled and measured
nicotine levels in this study further corroborates similar inconsistencies
for E-liquids sold in New York,65 North
Dakota,66 and South Korea.67

Conclusions
A number of harmful
compounds including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde,
methylglyoxal, acrolein, acetone, benzaldehyde, as well as the BTEX
compounds were among the components detected in the vapor phase of
E-cig. These compounds were produced primarily by the oxidation and
thermal decomposition of glycerol and PG, the two components that
make up the carrier solvent in the E-liquid. The higher the percentage
ratio of glycerol to PG, the higher the concentrations of the carbonyl
compounds emitted especially the acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, acrolein,
and acetone. Similarly, the concentrations of the alcohols and BTEX
compounds were also increased but to a smaller degree compared to
the carbonyl compounds. Benzaldehyde, diphenyl ether, and diethyl
phthalate were also detected in the aerosol phases of E-cig containing
only the glycerol/PG solvent mixture. Nicotine and menthol in the
Hangsen Menthol E-liquid could be deposited in the mouth and throughout
the pulmonary system even when passing through the smallest airway
of the bronchioles and alveoli at the concentrations of 15.3 and 2.3
μg/puff, respectively. Other components emitted from E-cig that
could be deposited in the mouth and airways were glycerol, benzaldehyde,
diphenyl ether, diethyl phthalate, and naphthalene. Further study
is necessary to investigate if debromination of flame retardants based
on PBDEs occurred in the E-cig atomizer and produced a small amount
of diphenyl ether. Although E-cig was initially presented as an alternative
to tobacco smoking and as a substitute to help smokers quit smoking,
there is still a long list of health risks associated with its use.

Materials
and Methods
Reagents and Chemicals
Two bottles of 30 mL Hangsen
Menthol E-liquid (18 mg/mL nicotine and 0 mg/mL nicotine) with a base
composition of 10% vegetable glycerin/glycerol (VG) and 90% PG were
purchased from Madvapes.com. Glycerol (>99.5%) and PG (99.5%) used in the vapor phase study
and particulate measurements using the cascade impactor were purchased
from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) and VWR International
(Suwanee, GA), respectively. Other reagents and standards including
nicotine, menthol, acrolein, acetone, ethanol, isopropanol, benzaldehyde,
benzyl alcohol, acetaldehyde, and methylene chloride, with their purities
ranging from 95 to 99.9%, were purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO or Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA. E-liquids with
only the base formulations of 10% glycerol and 90% PG (10:90 VG/PG)
similar to the base formulation of Hangsen Menthol was prepared in
the laboratory and was used as control. Other E-liquid base compositions
such as 100% PG, 20:80 VG/PG, 50:50 VG/PG, and 80:20 VG/PG were prepared
in the laboratory. The commercial Hangsen Menthol E-liquids were diluted
10-fold with methanol for GC–MS analysis of the liquid.

Sampling
of the Vapor Phase
An Innokin Iclear 30S (Shenzhen,
China) E-cig with a 3 mL liquid tank volume, Iclear 30S atomizer coil
made of Kanthal (2.80–6.90 V), and Istick 30 W battery with
a variable voltage of 2.0–8.0 V was purchased from Smoke &
Mirrors House of Vapor, Murfreesboro, TN. The Innokin E-cig device
was used for the collection of both vapor and particulate phase samples
from E-liquids with various VG/PG ratios for GC–MS analysis.
The E-cig was operated at 4.80 V and vaped at 3 s per puff for a total
of 12 puffs. The vapor samples were collected in Tedlar bags (SKC
Inc, Eighty Four, PA) that were connected to an inlet port on the
inside of the Vac-U-Chamber (SKC Inc, Eighty Four, PA). The same inlet
port was also connected via tubing from the outside fitting of the
Vac-U-Chamber to the E-cig emissions. The outlet port of the Vac-U-Chamber
was connected to a sampling pump with a flowrate of 2.0 L/min, which
is a sampling flowrate used previously for the cigarette emission
study.14 Just before sampling, the valve
of the Tedlar bag was opened, the lid of the Vac-U-Chamber was closed,
and the pump was activated to create a partial vacuum inside the chamber
that allowed the E-cig smoke to be drawn into the Tedlar bag. The
smoke-filled Tedlar bags were kept undisturbed for at least 1 h to
let the aerosol phase deposited inside the bags so that only the vapor
fraction of the smoke could be injected into the GC column for analysis.

Sampling of the Particulate Phase
A Sioutas cascade
impactor (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA) was used to collect the size-dependent
particulate fractions of the E-cig emissions. Particles were deposited
onto five different filter pads with the size fractions of filter
A (>2.5 μm), filter B (1.0–2.5 μm), filter C
(0.50–1.0
μm), filter D (0.25–0.5 μm), and filter L (<0.25
μm). The discs of the Sioutas cascade impactor are made of anodized
aluminum with O-rings being Buna-N (nitrile) and filter retainers
acrylic. A 25 mm diameter SKC PTFE filter with 0.5 μm pore size
was placed between discs labeled A, B, C, and D, whereas a 37 mm diameter
SKC PTFE filter with 2.0 μm pore size was used for the filter
L. For sampling, a constant flow rate of 9.0 L/min was maintained
using the Leland Legacy Pump (SKC Inc, Eighty Four, PA). After sampling,
the impactor was disassembled in a dust-free environment, and all
the filters were placed in individual vials with 5 mL methylene chloride
for extraction. The extraction of analytes in the five particulate
fractions was done by sonicating the filters for 1 h in an ultrasonic
bath (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The extract volumes were
reduced to 1.5 mL by gently blowing nitrogen gas using a 6-position
solvent evaporator (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The concentrated
samples were filtered using Phenex 0.2 μm filters (Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA) prior to GC–MS analysis.

Sampling and Analysis of
Vapor Phase by FTIR Spectrometry
The vapor emissions of the
Joyetech eVic-VT E-cig device (www.joyetech.com) with the dual
selection modes of variable temperature (200–600 °F) and
variable power (1–60 W) were analyzed by FTIR spectrometry.
The mist from the E-cig device with a nickel heating coil was transferred
via a tubing with a filter pad into a pre-evacuated Tornado 10 m gas
cell from Specac (Orpington, England) before being analyzed using
a Varian FTS-7000 FTIR spectrometer with a mercury cadmium telluride
(MCT/A) detector. Spectra were acquired for 30 scans at a spectrometer
resolution of 0.5 cm–1 and processed without zero
filling and using the Norton-Beer apodization method. The Varian spectral
data files were exported to the Thermo OMNIC format for analysis.
The infrared spectra of the E-cig vapor phase were compared to infrared
reference spectra of carbon monoxide, methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde,
and ethylene. These reference infrared spectra for quantitative analysis
were downloaded from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory website
or retrieved from the infrared spectral library of infrared analysis
(Anaheim, CA). The absorbance values of the reference IR spectra with
known ppm-meter values were compared to those of the sample spectra
in order to calculate the analyte concentrations based on Beer’s
law. Peak areas were generally used for the quantitative analysis
of compounds at spectral regions with no spectral interference. In
a few cases, the peak heights were used to circumvent the difficulty
of the peak area integration due to the partial spectral peak overlap.

GC–MS Analysis of Liquid, Vapor, and Particulate Phases
The vapor phase was analyzed using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph
(GC) coupled to an Agilent 5973 quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS).
A 16-position autosampler for automated sequential mode analysis was
connected to the GC–MS via the NUTECH 8900DS preconcentrator.
The preconcentrator has three cryogenic traps, the glass bead trap,
Tenax TA trap, and the cryofocuser. An accessory called GC Chaser
from Zip Scientific (Fast GC Technology, Goffstown, NH) was used to
improve the GC oven ventilation during cool-down cycles. The preconcentrator
was set to preheat to 10 °C, whereas the cooling temperature
was set at −150 °C, the desorption temperature at 20 °C
with preheat time 2 s, and desorption flow at 15 mL/min with desorption
time 2 min. The GC separation was performed using the Rxi-1ms capillary
column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA) with the stationary phase of 100%
polydimethylsiloxane and column parameters of 60 m × 0.32 mm
i.d. and a film thickness of 1.00 μm. Initially, the oven was
set at 30 °C for 3 min. The GC oven temperature was then programmed
to ramp three times sequentially without any hold, from 30 to 100
°C at 5 °C/min, from 100 to 150 °C at 12 °C/min,
and finally from 150 to 220 °C at 15 °C/min. The final temperature
was held for 4 min. The GC inlet temperature was maintained at 320
°C, and the helium carrier gas flowrate was set at 28 cm/s. A
mass spectrometer was operated in the simultaneous full scan, and
selected ion monitoring (SIM) modes. The electron impact ionization
was operated with electron energy of 70 eV. The interface temperature
was set at 320 °C, and mass spectra were recorded in the m/z range of 29–350 amu.

The
Shimadzu QP2010S GC–MS was used in a splitless injection mode
to analyze 1.0 μL sample extracts from the cascade impactor
filters with different size fractions of the aerosol phase in the
E-cig emission. The GC column was a Phenomenex ZB5-HT (Bellefonte,
PA) polyimide-coated fused silica column 5% phenyl/95% dimethylpolysiloxane
30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm. Initially,
the oven was held at 50 °C for 3 min followed by three stages
of temperature ramp-up. First, the temperature was increased from
50 to 150 °C at 5 °C/min and held for 1 min, then to 220
°C at 15 °C/min and held for 3 min, and finally to 320 °C
at 25 °C/min and held for 5 min. The inlet temperature was maintained
at 250 °C, and the flowrate of carrier helium gas was set at
40 cm/s. The mass spectrometer was operated in the scan mode with
its GC interface temperature set at 320 °C and the MS ion source
temperature kept at 200 °C. Mass spectra were acquired in the
mass range of 35–450 amu.

The analytes from the vapor
and aerosol phases were identified
via mass spectral matching of sample spectra with reference spectra
from the NIST 2014 MS database. In cases of ambiguity in spectral
matches with compounds having similar match indices, the chemical
identity was confirmed by evaluating the degree of fit of the unknown
compound on the linear regression plot of the GC retention times and
the corresponding retention indices for a set of compounds analyzed
using the same GC method. The concentrations of E-cig smoke constituents
were determined using linear regression equations from standard calibration
plots based on the linear slope and non-zero intercept. Graphs were
prepared using GraphPad Prism V.5 software, and chemical structures
were drawn using ACD/ChemSketch V.2 software. Data are reported as
“mean ± 1 standard deviation” for triplicate analysis
of samples.
