A novel
long-wavelength turn-on fluorescent chemosensor CS based
on pyrene was synthesized to detect Hg2+. In the
presence of other metal ions, CS could effectively recognize
Hg2+ and produce the turn-on fluorescent emission at 607
nm. Also, the absorption spectrum exhibited red-shift. Meanwhile,
the change of the solution color from yellow to orange was directly
observed by the naked eye. The interaction between CS and Hg2+ was confirmed by the Job’s plot, electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, and density
functional theory calculations. It was found that the fluorescence
of CS could be reversible when I– was
added into the solution of CS and Hg2+. CS illustrated high selectivity and good sensitivity for Hg2+ with the limit of detection of 36 nm. Moreover, CS could be utilized as test strips and silica gel plates to identify
Hg2+.

==== Body
Introduction
It is well known that
Hg2+ is harmful to human health
and environment1−4 because it can cause deadly damages to organs of the human body
including the brain, nervous system, endocrine system, and kidneys.5,6 Therefore, it is necessary to develop some rapid and efficient methods
to identify Hg2+.

Compared to others methods, fluorescent
and colorimetric chemosensors
have attracted more and more attention owing to their obvious advantages.7−9 At present, a lot of chemosensors toward Hg2+ have been
designed, synthesized, and characterized.10−13 In these chemosensors, there
are three aspects to be improved: (1) many chemosensors recognize
Hg2+ through the “on–off” fluorescent
type. However, the type is easy to give false positive results.14−16 (2) Although some chemosensors can recognize Hg2+ by
the “off–on” fluorescent type, their emission
wavelength is not long enough when they interact with Hg2+. Hence, their selectivity and sensitivity have been restricted.
It is essential to figure out certain chemosensors with long-wavelength
emission when they combine with Hg2+.17−22 (3) The structures of several chemosensors are too complicated to
be synthesized.23,24 In order to solve the defects,
it is necessary to seek turn-on, long-wavelength, and easy-synthesis
chemosensors toward Hg2+.

In this paper, a novel
pyrene-based chemosensor CS (Scheme 1) has been
synthesized by one-step reaction, by which it is convenient to be
separated and purified. When CS interacts with Hg2+, a new emission peak at 607 nm arises. Also, the absorption
spectrum exhibits red-shift. The color change can be directly observed
by the naked eye.

Results and Discussion
By the absorption
spectrum and the fluorescence spectrum, the effect
of metal ions on the spectrum behavior of CS was studied.
It was clear that only Hg2+ could lead to the absorption
change, the maximum absorption peak of which shifted from 427 to 470
nm. It was interesting that the solution color change directly from
yellow to orange could be observed by the naked eye (Figure 1). Also, the solution of CS displayed weak fluorescence when it was excited by 470
nm. Once Hg2+ was added into the CS solution,
the new red emission peak at 607 arose immediately. The change did
not happen as other metal ions were added except Hg2+ (Figure 2). Based on the changes
of spectra, it indicated that CS would recognize Hg2+ selectively and sensitively.

According to competitive
experiments, it was found that CS could efficiently identify
Hg2+ in the presence of other
metal ions (Figures 3 and 4). These results suggested that CS could be used as the fluorescent chemosensor for detecting
Hg2+ with long-wavelength emissions.

In order to discuss the
interaction between CS and
Hg2+, the molar method and the continuous variation method
were carried out to explore their complexation ratios. As a result,
Job’s plot showed 1:2 stoichiometry for the interaction between CS and Hg2+ (Figures S3–S6, Supporting Information). By mass spectral analyses,
an ion peak was detected at m/z 811.0479,
which was in accordance with [CS + 2Hg2+ +
H2O]+ (Figure S2, Supporting Information). On the basis of the data, it was clear that the
stoichiometric ratio between them was 1:2 when CS interacted
with Hg2+. To make further efforts to understand the interaction
between them, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiments were
applied to examine the aggregation of CS and CS–Hg2+. To our surprise, the aggregation of CS transformed the spherical flower-type into layered porous
structure after CS interacted with Hg2+. Also,
there were a lot of evident needle-like synapses on the layered structures
(Figure 5). Besides,
the limit of detection (LOD) of CS toward Hg2+ was calculated to be 36 nm (Figure S7, Supporting Information).12,23 In addition, the comparative
analysis of CS with chemosensors, which have been reported
previously is displayed in Table 1.

To ensure the interaction between CS and
Hg2+, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were adopted by
use of the Gaussian 03 program.32,33 It was definite that
the molecular orbital structure of CS–Hg2+ was different from CS in Figure 6. The highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) was uniformly distributed over the entire molecule in CS–Hg2+. Also, the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) was mainly concentrated around the CS–Hg2+ binding point. The energy gaps between the HOMO and LUMO
in CS and CS–Hg2+ was
calculated to be 2.9604 and 2.7051 eV, respectively. The results also
proved the interaction mode between CS and Hg2+ (Scheme 2).

plots of HOMO and LUMO of the CS and CS–Hg2+.

Scheme 2 Proposed Interaction Mode Between CS and Hg2+
For chemosensors to identify metal ions, reversibility was very
important.12 Therefore, the anion fluorescence
response experiment was performed by adding different kinds of anions.
Interestingly, it was definite that none but I– could
reduce the fluorescent intensity of [CS–Hg2+] at 607 nm to minimum when different kinds of anions (10
equiv) were added into the solution of [CS–Hg2+] (Figure 7). It was because I– might react with Hg2+, which makes the fluorescence of the solution turn off. Therefore,
it hinted that CS could detect Hg2+ reversibly
with an “off–on–off”-type fluorescent
signaling behavior.

Figure 7 Fluorescence spectra response of CS–Hg2+ in the presence of various anions (F–,
Cl–, Br–, I–, S2–, SO42–, SO32–, HCO3–,
H2PO4–, CO32–, NO3–, NO2– and AcO–) containing Hg2+ in HEPES buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4)/CH3CN (30:70,
v/v).

For inspecting CS practicability, test strips and
silica gel plates were prepared by us in line with the literatures.9,12 When test strips were immersed in the solutions of Hg2+, the fluorescence enhanced at once under the 365 nm UV lamp irradiation
(Figure 8a,b). Meanwhile,
the obvious color change was perceived under sunlight (Figure 8c,d). In addition, under the
365 nm UV lamp irradiation, the red fluorescent “Hg2+” image appeared immediately after the Hg2+ solution
was dipped with a brush and written on a silica gel plate containing CS (Figure 7e,f). Consequently, chemosensor CS could be looked upon
as the potential fluorescent probe in practice.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, long-wavelength chemosensor CS could
effectively recognize Hg2+ with high selectivity and good
sensitivity in the presence of other metal ions, which was synthesized
easily by one-step reaction. Also, the LOD of CS toward
Hg2+ was calculated to 36 nM. When CS interacted
with Hg2+, the fluorescent emission peak appeared at 607
nm. Meanwhile, the color change of the solution was observed directly
by the naked eye. The interaction between them was studied based on
the Job’s plot, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS),
SEM, and DFT calculations. In addition, CS could detect
Hg2+ with the “off–on–off”
type fluorescent signaling behavior. Moreover, chemosensor CS showed good future applications in detecting Hg2+ in
test strips and silica gel plates made by ourselves.

Materials and Physical Methods
All the materials used
for synthesis were procured from commercial suppliers and all solvents
and materials used without further purification. NMR spectra were
performed on a Bruker at 500 MHz using tetramethylsilane as an internal
standard and DMSO-d6 and CDCl3 as the solvents. UV–vis absorption spectra and luminescence
spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer
and a Horiba FluoroMax-4-NIR spectrometer. HRMS data were obtained
with a Shimadzu mass spectrometer. SEM measurements were recorded
on a Carl Zeiss Sigma 500.

The solution of inorganic salt were
prepared from the nitrate salts of K+, Na+,
Ag+, Hg2+, Ni2+, Co2+,
Cu2+, Mg2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Ba2+, Ce2+, Pb2+, Fe3+, and Y3+. The solutions of anions (F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, S2–, SO42–, SO32–, HCO3–,
H2PO4–, CO32–, NO3–, NO2–, and CH3COO–) were
prepared from their sodium or potassium salts. The solution of CS was prepared in HEPES buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4)/CH3CN (30:70, v/v) and the ligand concentration was kept constant (1.0
× 10–6 M).
