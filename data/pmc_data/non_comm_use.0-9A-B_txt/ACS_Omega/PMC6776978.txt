The
product distribution of ethers formed from the reaction of
cinnamyl alcohol with orthoesters in the presence of indium (III)
triflate (InOTf)3 is dependent on both the reaction temperature
and catalyst loading. Carrying out the reaction at room temperature
under low loadings of the catalyst leads to a facile reaction generating
the unexpected secondary allyl ether as the major product. In contrast,
carrying out the reaction under higher catalyst loadings at elevated
temperatures provides the expected primary linear ether in high yield
and with excellent selectivity. The etherification reaction is also
effective in the presence of acetals and ketals in place of orthoesters
and allows for the development of the procedure to encompass a telescoped
etherification protocol in which the acetal is generated in situ.

Introduction
The continuing interest
in the development of transition metal-catalyzed
processes involving allylic substrates is testimony to the versatility
and utility in this area of chemistry. Since the pioneering work of
Tsuji and Trost, the scope of allylic substitution reactions has been
expanded significantly and has developed into a powerful tool for
the formation of carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom
bonds, encompassing a range of nucleophiles, substrates, and metal
catalysts.1,2 Furthermore, the extension of this reaction
to encompass asymmetric variants is an area of significant current
interest, and a number of recent reviews highlight the elegant developments
and applications of this chemistry.3−6 In general, the majority of examples reported
to date employ activated allylic substrates, which bear a good leaving
group such as allylic esters, carbonates, or halides.7 Processes that employ allylic alcohols directly are not
as widespread, although the recent recognition of the importance of
waste minimization and the necessity for more benign and economical
reaction processes has begun to address this imbalance.8,9 The synthesis of allyl ether products remains an area of considerable
interest due to their diverse reactivity, which makes them highly
versatile synthetic intermediates, particularly in natural product
synthesis.10−13 While extensive work has demonstrated the facile reactions of carbon
and nitrogen nucleophiles in transition metal-catalyzed allylic substitution
reactions, the corresponding formation of carbon–oxygen bonds
from both derivatized and underivatized allylic substrates remains
a considerable challenge due to the low nucleophilicity of alcohols.14,15 Furthermore, the activation of alcohol substrates to nucleophilic
substitution reactions has been identified as a key research area
for further development within the pharmaceutical industry,16 and it is not surprising that there has been
considerable interest in the development of methodology that produces
ethers directly from alcohols without the requirement for strongly
basic conditions or environmentally damaging alkylating agents (Scheme 1 and eqs 1–5).17−21

Scheme 1 Previous Etherification Strategies Employing Cinnamyl Alcohol (A–C)
With this in mind, we were intrigued by the
work of Kumar et al.,
who reported that cinnamyl alcohol 1 undergoes a nonselective
reaction with triethyl orthoacetate (TEOAc) at elevated temperatures
in the presence of a weakly acidic silicate catalyst to produce a
mixture of ether products 2a and 3a in a
moderate yield, in addition to the quantities of products derived
from dimerization 4 and acylation 5 (Scheme 2).22

Scheme 2 Reaction of Cinnamyl Alcohol in the Presence of TEOAc
The formation of significant quantities of the
branched secondary
ether product 3a observed here is also noteworthy, since
these products are not generally observed in reactions employing linear
primary allylic substrates except under highly specialized conditions
such as in the case of iridium catalysis.23,24 The direction of the equilibrium for allylic alcohols bearing phenyl
substituents, such as 1, is dictated by thermodynamic
considerations favoring the formation of the more conjugated linear
products.21,25−27 Similarly, allylic substrates
derived from the corresponding secondary alcohol typically give primary
addition products as the major component of substitution reactions,
except in special circumstances.14,28,29 We were intrigued as to whether this orthoformate-mediated
reaction could be developed to access an operationally simple allylic
etherification protocol employing very mild reaction conditions, which
would minimize isomerization and allow selective access to either
the branched or linear ether products. Herein, we report our initial
findings in this area, the extension of this methodology to the development
of an acetal-mediated allylic etherification-reaction protocol, and
our initial studies on the development of a catalytic process, which
exploits the facile in situ generation of acetal and ketals.

Results
and Discussion
We reasoned that the reaction would be achieved
more efficiently
employing a catalyst that was sufficiently acidic to catalyze the
etherification reaction but would not lead to significant isomerization
of the ether products. Furthermore, this would also allow the use
of reduced temperatures and hence minimize the corresponding thermal
isomerization of the ether products. With this in mind, we considered
a number of heterogeneous catalysts displaying a range of acidities
to ascertain their effect on the etherification reaction of 1 in the presence of triethyl orthoformate (TEOF). Our preliminary
studies employed nanoporous aluminosilicate materials, which we have
previously demonstrated to be efficient catalysts for dehydrative
etherification reaction at moderate temperatures.30−32 Thus, the reaction
of 1 with low loadings of the mildly acidic aluminosilicate
catalyst Al-13-(3.18) (see Table S1 for
catalyst properties) in the presence of stoichiometric quantities
of TEOF at 60 °C resulted in good conversions of 1 and provided ether products 2a and 3a as
a mixture of isomers (2:1), in addition to small quantities of dimer 4 (∼10%) (Table 1, entry 1). Reducing the reaction temperature led to an increase
in the quantities of 3a (1:1), suggesting that thermal
isomerization may be an important factor in determining product ratios
(entry 2). Reducing the temperature further to 0 °C gave little
change in the ratio of isomers, however, overall yields were significantly
reduced (entry 3).

c Reaction

d Reaction contains 10 mg Amberlyst-15.

In order to investigate the potential
for thermal isomerization
further, the crude reaction mixture from entry 2 was heated to 60
°C for an additional hour (entry 4). Analysis of this sample
showed that the mixture now consisted predominantly of the linear
ether 2a, indicating that significant thermal isomerization
had occurred. The large pore borosilicate catalyst B-13-(3.54),33 which displays predominantly Lewis acidity,
gave only low yields of ether products (entry 5), as did the use of
the small pore zeolite ZSM-5-30 (entry 5). Improved yields were obtained
on switching to Amberlyst-15, a strongly acidic macroreticular sulfonic
acid resin with large pores, which gave a product distribution favoring
linear ether 2a (entry 7). Reactions employing the plain
silicate material S-1-(3.42), which displays very low acidity, gave
no significant conversion to ether products at room temperature (entry
8).

These results highlight the importance of a judicious choice
of
catalyst and reaction temperature on the selectivity of the etherification
of 1, and while encouraged by these initial results,
we recognize that further improvements in overall conversions and
selectivity would not be possible with relatively weak acidic catalysts.
Since the thermal sensitivity of 3a precludes the use
of elevated temperatures to improve overall conversions, and to avoid
extended reaction times at room temperature that could lead to equilibration
under the conditions employed, we explored the use of strong Lewis
acids to ascertain their potential as catalysts in this transformation.
Metal triflate-catalyzed reactions are currently of significant recent
interest, and they have found use as highly effective, environmentally
benign, and water-tolerant catalysts.34 Of particular interest has been the development of protocols employing
indium(III) salts, and in particular, indium(III) triflate (In(OTf)3), which has emerged as a highly flexible and chemoselective
catalyst for a range of synthetic transformations.35−37

Our initial
reactions investigated the effect of catalyst loading
on product distribution employing stoichiometric quantities of TEOF
at room temperature. Under relatively high catalyst loadings of In(OTf)3 (5 mol %), the reaction proceeded rapidly, giving approximately
equal amounts of ether products 2a and 3a (Table 2, entry 1).

e Reaction contains 2 equiv of MeOH.

Subsequent heating of this
reaction mixture to 60 °C led to
complete thermal isomerization and selectively give the linear ether
product 2a in high yields (entry 2). Decreasing the catalyst
loading to 0.5 mol % provided modest selectivity (∼2:1) for
the branched ether product 3a (entry 3). Leaving the
reaction for extended periods of time (>18 h) led to little change
in the product ratios. At room temperature, we believe that the low
catalyst loading employed is sufficient to catalyze formation of the
branched ether product 3a, however, it is not sufficient
to fully catalyze the subsequent isomerization to the thermodynamically
more stable linear ether product 2a. A similar selectivity
pattern was observed on switching from TEOF to TMOF, providing access
to the methyl ether products 2b and 3b (entries
4–6). These results compare very favorably with previous literature
etherification protocols, giving high yields of ether products in
very short reaction times and under much milder reaction conditions.17−21 Furthermore, the reaction is operationally simple, employing a commercially
available catalyst and requiring no special precautions such as inert
atmospheres or anhydrous conditions. Importantly, the reaction of 1 in the presence of In(OTf)3 and methanol in place
of TMOF gave low yields of ether products even after extended reaction
times (>18 h) (entry 7), as did the reaction of cinnamyl alcohol
with
TEOF in the absence of the catalyst. Replacing In(OTf)3 with other commercially available metal triflate salts gave broadly
similar reaction profiles, albeit with reduced overall conversion
to ether products (entries 8–10).

With an effective catalyst
and conditions for the reaction identified,
we next considered the reaction of cinnamyl alcohol with acetals and
ketals in place of orthoester reagents. While the use of orthoesters
provides a simple and effective process, an obvious limitation is
the challenge of regenerating the orthoformate species in situ, limiting
overall atom efficiency. We have recently demonstrated that dehydrative
etherification reactions proceed efficiently in the presence of acetals
and ketals,32 an alternative approach that
is highly attractive since the carbonyl by-product is far more versatile
in terms of its potential to regenerate the acetal species under the
reaction conditions (Scheme 3). Importantly, In(OTf)3 has previously been demonstrated
to be a highly efficient catalyst for the generation of acetals and
ketals38,39 and for transacetalization reactions,40−42 and provides significantly more opportunities for fine-tuning of
the reactivity.

Scheme 3 Potential Catalytic Cycle for the Acetal-Promoted
Allylic Etherification
Reaction
Our initial studies in this
area considered the etherification
reactions of 1 employing benzaldehyde dimethylacetal
(BDMA) and dimethoxy propane (DMOP) in the presence of In(OTf)3. We were gratified to observe that each of these reagents
efficiently promoted the etherification reaction (Table 3). In the case of BDMA, overall
yields were reduced in comparison to reactions employing orthoester
(entries 1–3), reflecting the lower reactivity of BDMA in comparison
to TEOF or TMOF, even in the presence of an excess of acetal (entry
4). Thermal isomerization was again successfully achieved on heating
the final reaction mixtures to 60 °C, which provided ether product 2b as the sole product with high selectivity (entry 5). Reactions
employing DMOP proved more successful, and at higher catalyst loadings,
provided ether products in moderate to good yields (entries 6–9).
In this case, yields were increased on employing an excess of DMOP
(entry 10), and were further improved on changing the reaction solvent
to acetone, providing ether products in excellent yields (entry 11).
The reaction process could also be extended to encompass the reaction
of diethoxypropane (DEOP) to provide access to ether products 2a and 3a, again in excellent yield (entry 12).
Presumably, the increased reactivity of DMOP in comparison to BDMA
facilitates rapid acetal exchange and promotes the etherification
reaction.

Finally, we addressed the interesting possibility that the etherification
process could be extended to utilize the ability of In(OTf)3 to generate the acetal or ketal species in situ from a carbonyl
compound and an alcohol. There has been significant recent interest
in the development of reaction sequences where multiple synthetic
transformations are achieved without the isolation and purification
of intermediates, as they offer considerable improvements in both
efficiency and the overall atom efficiency.43,44 We have previously demonstrated that In(OTf)3 is a highly
efficient catalyst for the in situ generation of acetals and their
subsequent reaction, particularly where there is a significant difference
in the reactivity of the acetal and the carbonyl species.45−47 With this in mind, we initially investigated two approaches by which
the acetal species could be generated in situ. The first approach
exploits the facile nature of the etherification reaction of 1 in acetone, which is used in a large excess to function
both as a solvent and a reagent for acetal formation. We were gratified
to observe that the etherification reaction proceeded smoothly in
the presence of 10 mol % In(OTf)3, giving the corresponding
ether products in good yields from a range of primary and secondary
alcohols (Table 4;
entries 1–6).

Finally,
we investigated the in situ formation of acetals using
stoichiometric quantities of aldehydes in the presence of In(OTf)3 (Table 5).
Reactions at room temperature in the presence of a small excess of
methanol employing relatively low catalyst loadings (5 mol %) provided
moderate yields of ether products, albeit over extended reaction times
(entry 1). Switching to 4-anisaldehyde provided a small improvement
in the overall yield, presumably reflecting the faster rate of formation
of the acetal intermediate or the subsequent transacetalization reaction
(entry 2). Heating the reaction reduced overall reaction times, and
for reactions employing methanol at 40 °C, good conversions of 1 to ether products 2b and 3b were
achieved (entries 3 and 4). Reactions employing higher alcohols, however,
proved more sluggish and required higher catalyst loadings to obtain
moderate yields in acceptable reaction times (entries 5–9).
As said previously, thermal isomerization was successfully achieved
on heating the final reaction mixtures to 60 °C, which provided
the secondary ether product 2d with high selectivity
(entry 8).

It also proved possible to obtain
moderate yields of ether products
in the presence of sub-stoichiometric quantities of aldehydes under
these conditions. Reactions in the presence of 20 mol % of 4-anisaldehyde
proceeded to give yields similar to those employing stoichiometric
quantities, offering support for the catalytic nature of the acetal
in these reactions (entry 10). Consistent with previous results, yields
of ether products were significantly lower in the absence of aldehyde,
(entries 11–14).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
demonstrated that low loadings of In(OTf)3 catalyze the
allylic substitution reactions of cinnamyl alcohol
in the presence of orthoesters to produce the branched allyl ethers
as the major products in very short reaction times. The product distribution
of the reaction is easily reversed to provide the corresponding linear
ethers by employing higher catalyst loadings, or can be achieved selectively
at elevated temperatures. We have also demonstrated that etherification
proceeds in the presence of acetals and ketals, which also efficiently
promotes the etherification reactions of cinnamyl alcohol. In the
case of BDMA, this reaction proceeds more slowly than in the presence
of orthoesters, requiring longer reaction times, and reflects the
increased stability of the acetal. Ketals, such as DMOP, display broadly
similar reactivity patterns to orthoesters providing the branched
allyl ether products at low catalyst loadings. This protocol can be
further extended to encompass a telescoped protocol in which the acetal
is generated in situ from an aldehyde or ketone and a small excess
of alcohol in the presence of In(OTf)3.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
Commercially available materials
were used as received. Alcohol solvents were dried and stored over
activated 3 Å molecular sieves prior to use. Nanoporous aluminosilicate
catalysts were prepared as described previously and stored at 140
°C for at least 12 h prior to use as was ZSM-5-30. Amberlyst-15
was dried overnight under vacuum. All reactions were carried out in
a sealed batch reactor. Product mixtures were analyzed using 1H NMR spectroscopy and GC–MS. Percentage yields, percentage
conversions, and selectivity were determined using quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy employing para-xylene by integration of
the relevant signals. GC–MS analysis was performed in EI mode
using a Varian 450GC and Varian 300MS employing a VF-5 ms capillary
column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., and 0.25 μm) operating with a gradient
temperature profile with an initial temperature of 50 °C for
3 min rising to 280 °C at a rate of 20 °C min–1 followed by a 3 min hold time. All products gave spectroscopic data
consistent with previous literature reports.21,28,29,48
