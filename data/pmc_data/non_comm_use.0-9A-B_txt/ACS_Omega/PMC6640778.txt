Photocatalytic CO2 conversion to fuel offers an exciting
prospect for solar energy storage and transportation thereof. Several
photocatalysts have been employed for CO2 photoreduction;
the challenge of realizing a low-cost, readily synthesized photocorrosion-stable
photocatalytic material that absorbs and successfully utilizes a broad
portion of the solar spectrum energy is as yet unmet. Herein, a mesoporous
p-type/n-type heterojunction material, CuxO–TiO2 (x = 1, 2), is synthesized
via annealing of Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites mixed with a TiO2 precursor (TiCl4). Such an experimental approach
in which two materials of diverse bandgaps are coupled provides a
simultaneous opportunity for greater light absorption and rapid charge
separation because of the intrinsic p–n heterojunction nature
of the material. As detailed herein, this heterostructured photocatalyst
demonstrates an improved photocatalytic activity. With the CO2 reduction of our optimal sample (augmented light absorption,
efficacious charge separation, and mesoporosity) that utilizes no
metal cocatalysts, a remarkable methane yield of 221.63 ppm·g−1·h−1 is achieved.

1 Introduction
The
continuous increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration
is considered to be a key driver that induces climate change.1 The prospect of unwanted climate change or climate
heating–desertification has compelled investigations into the
means to normalize atmospheric CO2 concentrations. As is
well known, CO2 is a highly stable molecule, requiring
significant energy input for its reduction.2 In this regard, sunlight is considered to be the most useful energy
source for promoting CO2 conversion into useful hydrocarbon
products, such as methane or ethane, offering the possibility of turning
sunlight into fuels compatible with the current energy infrastructure.

During the past several decades, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has received much attention as a photocatalyst because of its abundant
availability, nontoxicity, photocorrosion resistance, and excellent
charge transport properties.3 However,
the TiO2 bandgap of 3.2 eV limits its absorption to the
ultraviolet region, making it utilize only 4% of the entire solar
spectrum. To reduce the TiO2 bandgap such that it absorbs
a greater portion of the solar spectrum energy while maintaining its
commendable properties, various strategies have been investigated,
such as anion doping,4 loading of noble
metals like Pt, Pd, Au, and so forth to act as cocatalysts,5,6 and coupling of TiO2 with low-bandgap semiconductors.7 Composites of CuxO and TiO2 have been utilized for hydrogen evolution,8 CO2 photoreduction,9 and photodegradation of volatile organic compounds10 and as visible light-responding photocathodes.11 Therefore, we believe that coupling TiO2 with a suitable low-bandgap semiconductor, our interest herein,
can result in a broad-spectrum visible light-absorbing material with
improved photocatalytic activities. The present hybrid photocatalyst
based upon CuxO–TiO2 showcases a performance better than those of the previously reported
studies on CuO–TiO2 for CO2 photoreduction
into methane.9,12

Herein, we report the synthesis
and the photocatalytic application
of a mesoporous p–n heterojunction composite material without
metal cocatalyst sensitization, as commonly used. Our material is
composed of p-type CuxO (CuO and Cu2O) with a bandgap of ∼1.35–1.7 eV,13 coupled with n-type TiO2. The CuxO–TiO2 photocatalyst is
prepared using a facile and inexpensive two-step process: briefly,
Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites are synthesized via thermal decomposition,
which are then vigorously mixed with titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) under an argon atmosphere,
forming a gelatinous solution. The calcination under air of this gelatinous
solution results in a mesoporous CuxO–TiO2 composite.

During the ambient-atmosphere calcination
process, (1) TiCl4 oxidizes to form TiO2; (2)
Cu/Cu2O
nanocomposites are oxidized, forming CuxO (CuO and Cu2O); and (3) organic ligands used in the
synthesis of Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites are removed, providing
a firm heterojunction formation between CuxO and TiO2 with a well-defined mesoporous morphology.
A schematic diagram showing our experimental approach is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic view of our
experimental approach for the synthesis of
the mesoporous CuxO–TiO2 photocatalyst.

We test the resulting
photocatalyst for its ability to promote
the ambient-temperature photoconversion of CO2 and water
vapor to hydrocarbons and to discover a high rate conversion of CO2 to, almost exclusively, methane without the use of noble
metal codopants. For the purpose of optimization, various samples
of CuxO–TiO2 are prepared
with various amounts of TiCl4 (TiO2 precursor),
namely, CT03, CT05, CT07, and CT09 corresponding to 0.3, 0.5, 0.7,
and 0.9 mL of TiCl4, respectively, mixed with 20 mL of
Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites dispersed in toluene. To the best
of our knowledge, for the first time, hybrid mesoporous p-type CuxO (CuO and Cu2O) coupled with
n-type TiO2 for photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels without using metal cocatalysts is introduced.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the
CuxO–TiO2 Composites
The X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD) patterns of pure CuO, pure TiO2 (synthesized
from TiCl4), and CuxO–TiO2 samples are shown in Figure 2.10 The XRD patterns of
the CuxO–TiO2 samples mainly
show, an intense peak at 2θ = 26.2°, corresponding to d101 of anatase TiO2, confirming the
presence of anatase TiO2 as well as a relatively small
amount of Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites in the CuxO–TiO2 samples. This result, we
assume, is likely due to the low crystallinity and high dispersion
of CuxO species on TiO2 surfaces.8,10 From the inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP-AES) analysis of the representative sample CT07, 2 wt % Cu is
determined, which corresponds to approximately 80% of the Cu content
obtained using the data from the field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) technique
(Figure S5).

Figure 2 XRD patterns of pure
CuO, pure TiO2 and CuxO−TiO2 samples.

Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM
(HR-TEM) images of the Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites and a representative
CuxO–TiO2 sample (CT07)
are shown in Figure 3. The as-synthesized Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites show excellent
size uniformity (Figure 3A) with the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern showing d111 planes for both Cu2O and Cu.
The HR-TEM image (Figure 3B) shows respective lattice fringes for Cu2O and
Cu metal, which are well-matched with the SAED pattern.10 To check the mesoporosity of the CuxO–TiO2 sample, FE-SEM and HR-TEM
images of the sample CT07 can be seen in Figures S2 and S3, respectively. Furthermore, the STEM image of the
sample CT07 (Figure 3C) confirms the readily discernible mesoporous nature of the CuxO–TiO2 samples. The STEM
elemental mapping of the CT07 sample further (Figure S4) confirms the presence of Cu and Ti. Figure 3D exhibits the HR-TEM image
of the sample CT07 showing well-defined lattice fringes of 0.28 and
0.35 nm, corresponding to the d110 plane
of CuO and the d101 plane of TiO2, respectively. The SAED pattern of an interface region (inset of Figure 3D) further confirms
the formation of CuO and TiO2 regions within the CuxO–TiO2 matrix with rings
indexed to the d110 plane of CuO and the d101 plane of anatase TiO2.10

of the photocatalyst can be clearly discerned, and (D) HR-TEM and

The UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS)
of pure TiO2 and CuxO–TiO2 samples (Figure 4A) exhibit two prominent changes: (1) pure TiO2 is unable to absorb visible light, whereas the UV−vis DRS
spectra of the modified samples exhibit a shift in the absorption
edge to longer wavelengths (400–600 nm), which is attributed
to the formation of a heterojunction between CuxO and TiO2;14,15 and (2) the absorption
band in the near infrared (600–1000 nm) is observed because
of the Cu loading and thus is attributed to a 2Eg →
2T2g interband transition in the CuII clusters
deposited over TiO2.16

Figure 4 (A) UV–vis
DRS of all samples showing red shift in the CuxO–TiO2 samples attributed
to the formation of a CuxO–TiO2 heterojunction and absorption in the 600–1000 nm range
because of CuxO intrinsic absorptions.
(B) Corresponding Tauc plots for the bandgap estimation of the CuxO–TiO2 samples.

The bandgap values of all samples are estimated
using Tauc plots
(Figure 4B) and are
listed in Table 1.
The variation in the bandgap can be attributed to the amount of Cu/Cu2O present. The bandgap of the composites gradually increases
with an increase in the TiCl4 content; the lowest value
was 3.09 eV for sample CT03 containing 0.3 mL of TiCl4 mixed
in a 20 mL Cu/Cu2O solution.

The photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of TiO2 (synthesized
from the TiCl4 precursor), Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites,
and the sample CT07 can be seen in Figure 5. Pure TiO2 depicts a sharp peak
around 385 nm because of emission from band-to-band recombination
with other peaks appearing in the range of 400–600 nm, attributed
to the electron transitions from the inter-bandgap defect levels.17,18 Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites exhibit a UV emission peak at
380 nm and a visible emission peak at 520 nm, attributed to the recombination
of electron–hole pairs in free excitons or deep-level defects
and photogenerated electrons in CuxO,
respectively.19,20 For the sample CT07, the visible
emission peak for CuxO at 520 nm is quenched
as compared to that of Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites, thereby
suggesting the formation of a p–n junction at the interface,
resulting in a reduced rate of recombination.

Figure 5 PL emission spectra of
pure TiO2, Cu/Cu2O
nanocomposites, and the sample CT07.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas
and
pore-size distributions are measured for all CuxO–TiO2 samples (Figure S6), with their values displayed in Table 1. CT07 shows the largest surface area (26.95
m2·g–1), approximately 2.4 times
higher than that of CT03 (11.05 m2·g–1). It is observed that on increasing the amount of TiCl4, the surface area decreases, possibly because of the increased aggregation
induced by the higher amounts of the Ti precursor.

Further evidence
for CuxO–TiO2 formation
comes from an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis of the sample CT07. Figure 6A shows the Ti 2p region with two intense
peaks at 457.6 and 464.0 eV, corresponding to Ti 2p3/2 and
Ti 2p1/2 states, respectively, ensuring the presence of
Ti4+ ions.21 The satellite shoulder
peaks appearing at higher binding energies are assumed to be because
of the Ti4+ state in the Ti–O–Cu structure.22 The Cu 2p region (Figure 6B) exhibits Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 main peaks appearing around 933.0 and 953.0 eV, with satellite
peaks at 942.5 and 962.5 eV, respectively. The main Cu 2p peaks are
further deconvoluted into four peaks, where peak 1 and peak 3 are
assigned to the Cu+ species (Cu2O), whereas
peak 2 and peak 4 are associated with the Cu2+ species
(CuO).14,23 The satellite peaks are attributed to the
ligand-to-metal charge transfer, an important indicator of the presence
of Cu2+ species24 by an open
3d shell,9 which is not observed for Cu+ or metallic Cu0 species because of their completely
filled 3d shell.10 Furthermore, the energy
gap between peak 2 and peak 4 is 20.0 eV, which matches well with
the standard value of 20.0 eV for CuO.23 The Cu 2p XPS data suggest the presence of two phases, that is,
CuO and Cu2O in the as-prepared samples. The O 1s region
(Figure 6C) reveals
the presence of three peaks located at 529.7, 531.2, and 532.3 eV
corresponding to Ti–O, O–H, and C–O bonds, respectively.8 The XPS spectra of all other synthesized samples,
namely, CT03, CT05, and CT09, are given in Figures S7, S8, and S9, respectively. All samples show characteristic
peak positions similar to that of the representative sample CT07,
confirming the successful formation of the CuxO–TiO2 heterojunction.

peaks located at 529.7, 531.2, and 532.3 eV corresponding to Ti–O,

2.2 Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 into Methane and Its Proposed Mechanism
Photocatalytic
CO2 conversion into hydrocarbon fuels is used to test the
CuxO–TiO2 sample. Pure
TiO2 (synthesized from the TiCl4 precursor)
and pure bulk CuO are used as reference samples. Analysis of the products
obtained from all samples using gas chromatography (GC) predominantly
shows methane as the main hydrocarbon product. Figure 7 shows that the methane production rate after
each sample is illuminated for 1 h of solar illumination. When CuxO is coupled with TiO2, all samples
show an increase in the CH4 yield. With an increasing amount
of TiCl4 for the synthesis of CuxO–TiO2, the amount of CH4 evolution
increases, reaching a maximum value with CT07. A further increase
in TiCl4 beyond CT07 decreases the CH4 yield,
which we believe is due to the low surface area of CT09 limiting active
sites to interact with the CO2 molecules. CT07 exhibits
a methane evolution of 221.63 ppm·g−1·h−1, a value which is 11.1 times and
22 times higher than for pure CuO (20.01 ppm·g−1·h−1) and TiO2 (9.94 ppm·g−1·h−1), respectively. It is
noted that this yield is better than those of our previously reported
photocatalysts utilized for CO2 conversion into methane.9,25−28

Figure 7 Rates
of CH4 evolution measured under simulated solar
irradiation for pure TiO2, pure CuO, and all CuxO−TiO2 samples. The sample CT07
shows the highest methane evolution rate of 221.63 ppm·g−1·h−1. The control test of the
CT07 sample in an Ar/H2O(g) mixture exhibits negligible
CH4 evolution.

The rate of CH4 production is calculated for all
CuxO–TiO2 samples using eq 7, as listed in Table 1. Control tests performed
by illuminating CT07 in an Ar/H2O(g) atmosphere under similar
irradiation conditions show a negligible amount of CH4 evolution.
Thus, it can be inferred from the control experiment that CH4 evolved during the normal experiments is due to the photoreduction
of CO2 and not because of the oxidation of surface-bound
organics.

The stability of the representative sample CT07 is
measured by
its repeated testing for five cycles (Figure S11). The representative sample CT07 shows good stability without any
acute decrease in the methane production rate: hence, one can see
that the rate of CO2 reduction on the fifth test is approximately
88% that of the first.

An elucidation based upon experimental
results and on the literature that reported the energy levels and
the suggested process for the conversion of CO2 and water
vapor into methane is shown in Figure 8. As revealed by XPS data, CuxO–TiO2 contains both Cu2O and
CuO, the conduction band edges of which are both more negative than
TiO2.29−31 Thus, upon illumination within the CuxO–TiO2 photocatalyst, generation
of electrons (e–) and holes (h+) takes
place, whereby the electrons in p-type CuxO can easily flow to the conduction band of TiO2 to contribute
to the photoreduction of adsorbed CO2, whereas the photogenerated
holes migrate in the opposite direction to oxidize the adsorbed H2O, releasing H+ and O2.

Figure 8 Schematic illustration
of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CH4 using CuxO–TiO2 heterojunction
samples.

The photoreduction of CO2 is a complex process. Initially,
the adsorption of CO2 takes place over the semiconductor
surface, leading to an activation of the CO2 molecule for
reduction. Although CO2 is a linear molecule, its adsorption
on a photocatalyst surface transforms it into a bent structure, with
a decrease in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level
of CO2, thus offering a lower barrier for accepting electrons
under illumination.32 When light is illuminated
upon the CO2-adsorbed photocatalytic material, the photoexcited
electrons generated are injected to the adsorbed CO2 to
proceed with the reduction reactions, with the formation of various
intermediate free radicals and products.33 Among the various CO2 photoreduction mechanisms proposed,
the carbene pathway is the most widely accepted pathway for yielding
CH4 and/or CH3OH as the main products.33 The literature for the carbene pathway mechanism
is well-defined and is considered reliable based on the investigations
made using electron spin resonance (ESR) and electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) experimental techniques.34−36 The carbene
pathway begins with the injection of a single electron into the adsorbed
CO2, forming an anion radical CO2•–.37 Such a single electron reduction of
CO2 to an anion radical CO2•– possesses a strong negative electrochemical potential of −1.9
V versus a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).36 Hence, with such a high potential required for this step, it seems
highly improbable for the semiconductors to proceed with the reduction.
Therefore, at this stage, it is considered that as soon as the CO2•– radical is formed, it reacts with
the protons H+ (provided by water oxidation via filling
holes) and photogenerated electrons to produce intermediate radicals
and products. Such a process is known as “proton-assisted multielectron
reduction” and is generally acceptable for the CO2 photoreduction process. The radicals and products produced at the
intermediate stages further undergo a series of proton-assisted multielectron
reductions, finally yielding CH4 as the main product. Thus
considering the proton-assisted multielectron reduction via the carbene
pathway, we propose a possible route for CO2 photoreduction,
a schematic view of which is shown in Figure 8. Photogenerated electrons (e–) and holes (h+) are generated at the active sites of
the CuxO–TiO2 photocatalyst
(eq 1). The holes (h+) react with the adsorbed H2O to produce hydroxyl
radicals (OH•) and protons (H+) (eq 2). The surface-adsorbed
CO2•– radical generated by the
injection of a single electron (eq 3) reacts with e– and H+, producing CO (eq 4), which undergoes a further reduction process forming the surface-adsorbed
C (eq 5). This surface-adsorbed
C reacts with 4e– and 4H+ to yield CH4 (eq 6) as a
main product. The proposed reactions involved in the CO2 photoreduction to CH4 can be described by eqs 1–6. 1   2   3   4   5   6  

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Synthesis of Mesoporous CuxO–TiO2 Heterostructured Composites
The synthesis of mesoporous
CuxO–TiO2 heterostructured
composites was carried out using a simple
impregnation step. An already prepared Cu/Cu2O nanocomposite
solution (6 mL) (details in Supporting Information) was dispersed in 20 mL of anhydrous toluene in a rubber-capped
vial and degassed for 30 min under vacuum to remove any air dissolved
in the solution and filled with an inert gas (Ar). The degassed solution
was transferred into the glove box, followed by a dropwise addition
of a certain amount of 1 M titanium(IV) chloride solution (0.3, 0.5,
0.7, and 0.9 mL of TiCl4) to the degassed solution. The
color of the solution changes from dark green to dark yellow. After
1 h of reaction,
a well-dispersed solution mixture of dark yellow Cu/Cu2O nanocomposite and TiCl4 was formed and is allowed to
oxidize spontaneously in air for 30 min under stirring. A change in
the color of the mixture from dark yellow to reddish brown is observed.
The gel-type mixture of Cu/Cu2O nanocomposite and TiCl4 was dried under air at 70 °C and then subsequently calcined
in a tubular furnace at 400 °C, at a ramping rate of 6 °C/min
under air flow (20 cc/min) for 3 h. The annealing process oxidizes
both the Cu/Cu2O nanocomposite and TiCl4 forming
CuxO–TiO2 (where x = 1 or 2), a well-known oxidation process that has been
reported earlier.38−40 The CuxO–TiO2 samples obtained with
0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 mL of TiCl4 were labeled as CT03,
CT05, CT07, and CT09, respectively.41

3.2 Photocatalyst Characterization
XRD
studies were performed using a Panalytical, Empyrean diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) in the range of
2θ = 10°–90° at 1°/min. Surface morphologies
and composition were observed using a field emission scanning electron
microscope (Hitachi S-4800) equipped with an EDS attachment. High-resolution
images were obtained using a field emission transmission electron
microscope (FE-TEM, Hitachi HF-3300) operating at 300 kV, where the
samples were prepared on a Ni grid.

The surface areas of the
products were analyzed using the BET method (Micromeritics ASAP 2000
apparatus) at −196 °C. XPS (Thermo VG, K-alpha) with Al
Kα line operating at 148 606 eV as the X-ray source was
used to study the surface composition and oxidation states of CuxO–TiO2. The optical properties
of the samples were studied using UV–vis DRS Cary series (Agilent
Technologies) with an attached diffuse reflectance accessory. PL was
measured using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent
Technologies), λexc = 300 nm for all samples. The
copper content in the photocatalyst was deduced using the ICP-AES
analysis using a Thermo Scientific iCAP 7400 duo ICP-AES instrument.

3.3 Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion
In the photocatalytic CO2 conversion experiment, an
empty photoreactor (stainless steel; volume = 15.4 cm3)
was purged with CO2 gas (1000 ppm in He) and vacuum simultaneously
to remove any air or other impurities before and after the loading
of the photocatalyst.41 The photocatalyst
(50 mg) was loaded into the photoreactor; moist CO2 gas
(1000 ppm in He) was passed through a water bubbler, which then enters
the photoreactor. The photocatalyst-loaded photoreactor, filled with
a mixture of CO2 and H2O vapors mixture, was
then illuminated by a 100 W Xenon solar simulator (Oriel, LCS-100)
with an AM1.5 filter for 1 h, and the reaction products (500 μL)
were analyzed using a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph (Restek Rt-Q
Bond column, ID = 0.53 mm, and length = 30 m) equipped with flame
ionization (FID) and thermal conductivity (TCD) detectors. Figure S1 shows the schematic of the experimental
setup for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The hour-normalized
photocatalytic CH4 evolution rate is calculated using eq 7. 7  Five cycles of CO2 photoreduction
were performed to test the stability of the same sample; after every
test, the photoreactor was purged with Ar gas and vacuum, then re-filled
with CO2 gas (1000 ppm in He), followed by a 1 h illumination
for the next testing cycle.

4 Conclusions
In summary, hybrid CuxO–TiO2 photocatalysts are prepared via a facile experimental approach
comprising two steps, that is, synthesis of Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites
followed by mixing with TiCl4 and subsequent oxidation.
The as-prepared samples are characterized using analytical techniques
including XRD, TEM, UV–vis DRS, PL, BET, and XPS. A red shift
in the light absorption is observed for the CuxO–TiO2 samples, mainly attributed to the
formation of nanoscale heterojunctions between CuxO and anatase TiO2, providing a better charge separation
and an increase in the optical absorption. Among the CuxO–TiO2 samples, the sample CT07
produces the highest CH4 yield with production rates, 11.1
and 22 times higher than pure CuO and TiO2, respectively.
The improved photocatalytic activity can be attributed to (1) the
improved light absorption with a significant red shift in the absorption
wavelength; (2) formation of p–n heterojunctions with suitable
band edge positions for the improved separation of the photogenerated
charge; and (3) large surface areas to promote interfacial reactions.
A further increase in the TiCl4 amount, sample CT09, resulted
in a decrease in the CH4 evolution rate, which we believe
is due to a reduced surface area and a wider bandgap.

Our material
synthesis strategy of hybrid CuxO–TiO2 recommends coupling of low-bandgap
materials with large-bandgap materials as an efficient approach for
the design of high-performance photocatalysts.
