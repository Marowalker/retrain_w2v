Herein, we describe the synthesis
of novel light-emitting liquid-crystalline
(LC) compounds bearing pentafluorinated bistolane-based luminophores
with a V- or a Y-shaped molecular geometry and the evaluation of their
LC and photophysical characteristics. The V- or Y-shaped compounds
exhibited a unique LC phase and showed photoluminescence (PL) behavior
under various circumstances, such as in dilute solution or in the
solid state. Notably, PL characteristics were observed even under
high-temperature conditions with a crystal (Cr) to LC phase transition,
although the PL efficiency (ΦPL)
was gradually reduced because of thermal molecular motion. Interestingly, ΦPL was found to be completely recovered
through the LC → Cr phase transition during the cooling process;
the PL characteristics of the V- or Y-shaped compounds were sensitively
changed by external thermal stress, giving these compounds the ability
to act as thermoresponsive PL sensing materials.

Introduction
Solid-state light-emitting
materials1 have attracted enormous attention
for use as a source of illumination
in organic light-emitting diodes2 or polymer
light-emitting diodes.3 However, most organic
luminescent compounds do not emit luminescence in aggregated states,
such as the solid state, because of the aggregation-caused quenching
effect,4,5 even though intensive emission has been
observed in the dilute solution state. Therefore, the exploitation
of light-emitting materials in the solid state has become increasingly
demanded.

Because of the seminal findings of Tang, that is,
aggregation-induced
emission6 and crystallization-induced emission
(CIE),7 the exploitation of such solid-state
light-emitting compounds has accelerated, and a number of luminous
compounds, including solid-state luminophores, have been successfully
produced thus far. From the extensive studies on solid-state luminescent
compounds, two important factors in controlling the luminescence color
have emerged: (i) the molecular aggregation in the condensed phase8 and (ii) the electron-density distribution of
the whole compound.9 Our group produced
nonliquid-crystalline tolane and liquid-crystalline (LC) bistolane
derivatives (1, Figure 1A) with a pentafluorinated aromatic scaffold and revealed
that the emission behavior in the crystal dramatically changed depending
on the length of the alkoxy chain substituted at the molecular terminal.10 Additionally, modulating the electron-density
distribution on the pentafluorinated bistolane derivatives by substituting
a more electron-donating amino group for the terminal alkoxy substituent
was found to cause a significant photoluminescence (PL) color change
from deep blue to green (2, Figure 1A).11 The former
results made us envision that various PL behaviors, such as PL intensity
and color, could be obtained if the molecular aggregation of 1 could be successfully controlled by the application of an
external stimulus.

bistolane derivatives. (B) Conceptual illustration of the molecular
design for light-emitting liquid crystals. (C,D) Schematic illustration
of the novel molecular designs with V- or Y-shaped geometry.

The use of organic LC molecules
to precisely control molecular
aggregation is attractive because the aggregated structures of such
compounds can change reversibly via thermal phase-transition between
the crystal (Cr) and isotropic liquid (Iso) in response to external
stimuli, for example, heat or electric fields. Therefore, organic
luminescent compounds possessing LC characteristics, known as light-emitting
liquid crystals, have received considerable interest. Light-emitting
liquid crystals show intriguing optical characteristics in various
molecular arrangements formed through phase transition by applying
external heat or an electrical stimulus.12,13 Among such light-emitting liquid crystals, our LC bistolane derivative
(1) demonstrated to show intriguing switching of their
PL behavior through the phase transition between the Cr ⇄ LC
phases.10b,14 The temperature-dependent PL switching was
likely attributable to a dynamic change in molecular aggregation via
a thermal phase transition. The pentafluorinated bistolane derivatives
are light-emitting liquid crystals, that is, thermoresponsive PL compounds,
which could become promising PL-sensing materials, such as fluorescent
thermometers.

On the basis of these accumulated results, as
shown in Figure 1B,
molecular structures
possessing both LC and PL characteristics can be easily designed by
combining the following elements: (i) an extended π-conjugated
structure for the light-emitting characteristics, (ii) an alkoxy-substituent
at the longitudinal molecular terminal for LC properties, and (iii)
a fluorinated aromatic moiety to determine the electron-density distribution
of the molecule. To develop novel light-emitting liquid crystals,
we then directed our attention toward dramatically changing the molecular
geometry from a linear to a V- or Y-shaped geometry (Figure 1C,D) because bent molecules
are known to form unique LC phases15 and
to show PL characteristics in solution or in the solid state.16 In this article, the synthesis of V- and Y-shaped
organic compounds bearing a pentafluorinated bistolane fragment as
a luminophore and the evaluation of their LC and photophysical properties
are disclosed in detail.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
Our
target structures for this study were
the V-shaped molecules V-3 with an isophthalate-based
core17 and the Y-shaped analogues Y-4 with a 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate-based core,18 both of which contain pentafluorinated bistolane-based
luminophores on their arms. The V-shaped V-3 and Y-shaped Y-4 were prepared from readily accessible 4-[3-(methoxymethoxy)propyloxy]phenylacetylene
(5a) or 4-[6-(methoxymethoxy)hexyloxy]phenylacetylene
(5b), respectively, according to the procedure shown
in Scheme 1.

Procedure for the Novel V-Shaped Molecules V-3 and Y-Shaped
Molecules Y-4
Thus, 5a, which contained a propylene linker
and was
readily prepared from 4-bromophenol, participated in a Sonogashira
cross-coupling reaction with 1-bromo-4-[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyn-1-yl]benzene
under the influence of a catalytic amount of Cl2Pd(PPh3)2, PPh3, and CuI in Et3N
at 100 °C for 20 h to give the corresponding coupling product 6a in 59% yield, which subsequently underwent C–Si
bond cleavage under basic conditions to provide the corresponding
terminal acetylene 7a in 66% yield. 7a was
subjected to the Sonogashira cross-coupling conditions described above
with iodopentafluorobenzene followed by immediate deprotection of
the acetal moiety under acidic conditions to obtain the corresponding
pentafluorinated bistolane 2a with a 3-hydroxypropoxy
substituent with a 59% two-step yield. Similarly, pentafluorinated
bistolane 2b, which contained a 6-hydroxyhexyloxy-substituent,
was successfully obtained in four reaction steps in a similar efficiency.
Finally, the condensation of isophthaloyl chloride with the bistolane-luminophore-bearing
alcohol 2a or 2b in the presence of a catalytic
amount of N,N-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP) and an excess amount of Et3N in CH2Cl2 at room temperature for 14 h gave rise to the corresponding
V-shaped compounds V-3a and V-3b in 23 and
79% yield, respectively, after double purification by silica gel column
chromatography, followed by recrystallization using a 1:1 ratio mixed
solvent system (good solvent: CH2Cl2, poor solvent:
MeOH). Under similar condensation conditions, the use of 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl
trichloride rather than isophthaloyl chloride allowed the formation
of the corresponding Y-shaped analogues Y-4a and Y-4b in 19% yields, respectively, just after the double purification
technique. The chemical structures of the four compounds were fully
characterized by 1H, 13C, and 19F
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and
high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The 1H and 13C spectra confirmed that the compounds were sufficiently
pure for evaluation of their LC and photophysical properties.

Phase-Transition
Behavior
First, the phase-transition
behavior of the novel V-shaped compounds V-3 and Y-shaped
compounds Y-4 bearing pentafluorinated bistolane luminophores
was evaluated using a polarizing optical microscope (POM) and differential
scanning calorimeter (DSC). The phase sequences, temperatures, and
optical textural images observed are listed in Table 1.

Cr: crystalline,
NX: unusual nematic, N: nematic, Iso: isotropic phases.

temperature was determined using DSC measurements (5.0 °C min–1, N2 atmosphere) of the second cycle.

c Polarized optical micrographic
images
observed during the second cooling process.

d DSC measurement was performed at
a scan rate of 10 °C min–1 under an N2 atmosphere.

e Phase and
transition temperature
were determined using POM because of a less exothermal heat value.

f Not determined because of a
low
heat quantity.

POM observation
clearly revealed that all of the V- and Y-shaped
compounds bearing pentafluorinated bistolane luminophores were enantiotropic
liquid crystals that showed an LC mesophase between the Cr and Iso
phases during both the heating and cooling processes. Careful observation
of the phase transitions of all samples during the second cooling
process revealed that four-brushed schlieren or droplet textures,
which are typical for nematic (N) LCs, were observed at temperatures
slightly lower than the clearing temperature (Tc), indicating that all of the V-3 and Y-4 compounds exhibited an N LC mesophase just before the Iso phase.
For the propylene-linker compound V-3a, gradual cooling
from the N phase caused direct crystallization at 160 °C. In
contrast, the other compounds, that is, V-3b, Y-4a, and Y-4b, exhibited smecticlike textures in the POM
images with a fluidity intermediate between that of the N and Cr phases,
in which the bright-viewing textures changed dramatically to the dark-viewing
field after adding shear stress. To further characterize the LC phase,
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out at various temperatures
during the second cooling cycle for the three compounds V-3b, Y-4a, and Y-4b. Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns obtained for the
hexylene-linker compounds V-3b and Y-4b at
20 °C intervals from 200 to 60 °C during the second cooling
process.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of (A) V-3b and (B) Y-4b measured
at various temperatures between 200 and 60 °C during
the second cooling process. Gray: crystalline, green: NX, blue: N, and red: Iso phase.

The XRD measurements showed that a significantly different
diffraction
pattern was observed below 100 °C; only halo peaks were found
for both compounds V-3b and Y-4b above 100
°C, whereas well-defined diffractions were observed when the
sample was cooled below 100 °C. As noted previously, optical
textures observed under the POM suggested a smectic-like structure,
whereas the XRD measurements did not exhibit any diffraction signal
in the small-angle region at all, strongly indicating a mesophase
with a nematic character without any long-range positional order.19,20 Judging from the results of the XRD and POM measurements, the LC
phases observed in V-3b, Y-4a, and Y-4b can be assigned as an unusual N phase, denoted as an
NX phase, rather than a smectic phase.

Comparing
the phase-transition temperatures of the samples summarized
in Table 1, the molecular
geometry and length of the flexible unit clearly influenced the stability
of the Cr and LC phases. The melting temperature (Tm), which is defined as the temperature at which the phase
transition from the Cr to the LC phase occurs, indicated that V-3 had a more stable Cr phase than Y-4. In addition,
the compounds with propylene linkers, V-3a and Y-4a, possessed much higher Tm values than the corresponding hexylene-linker compounds V-3b and Y-4b. The Tc values
showed the opposite trend, with compounds Y-4 having
higher temperatures for the phase transition from the N to the Iso
phase compared to the corresponding V-3 compounds. Moreover,
the flexible chain length seemed to affect the stability of the LC
phases in comparison with the corresponding short-linker compounds V-3a and Y-4a; compounds V-3b and Y-4b with long flexible units exhibited phase transition from
the N to the Iso phase at temperatures approximately 40 °C lower
because of the destruction of the directionally ordered structures
by the dynamic molecular motion. Considering the relationship between
the molecular geometry, the chain length of the flexible unit, and
the phase-transition temperature, the stability of the Cr phase can
be attributed to the V-shaped molecular geometry owing to its more
symmetric structure, whereas greater LC phase stability can be obtained
with the Y-shaped molecular geometry; LC phases were observed over
a broad temperature range for the Y-shaped compounds. In terms of
the length of the flexible chain, compounds with short flexible units
showed enhanced stability in both the Cr and LC phases owing to their
relatively rigid structures, which favored the maintenance of molecular
order in the aggregated state. Thus, it can be concluded that not
only the molecular geometry but also the length of flexible unit are
important criteria to control the phase-transition characteristics
of LC compounds.

UV–Vis Absorption and PL Behavior
in Solution
Subsequently, the photophysical properties of V-3a, V-3b, Y-4a, and Y-4b in dilute CH2Cl2 solution were determined.
The absorption and
PL properties of CH2Cl2 solutions of these compounds
were measured using a UV–visible spectrometer and fluorometer. Figure 3 shows the absorption
and PL spectra of the present compounds, photographs of their PL in
CH2Cl2 solution, and the PL colors plotted on
a Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) diagram. For
comparison, the absorption and PL spectra of the linear analogues 1a and 1b are also included in Figure 3A,B. The photophysical data
obtained are summarized in Table 2.

As shown in Figure 3A, in CH2Cl2 solution
(ca. 10–5 mol L–1), the propylene-linker
compounds V-3a and Y-4a absorbed UV light
with a single
absorption band, of which the maximum wavelengths were 330 and 331
nm; this absorption involved electronic transition from the ground
to the excited states. The exciton was observed to be immediately
deactivated with light-emission at similar maximum wavelengths (V-3a: λPL = 406 nm; ΦPL = 0.99, Y-4a: λPL = 407 nm; ΦPL = 0.95) with high efficiency. Similarly, the hexylene-linker
compounds V-3b and Y-4b also showed effective
absorption characteristics at a maximum absorption wavelength (λabs) of 334 nm and intense PL with maximum λPL values of ca. 410 nm and a high ΦPL (Figure 3B). The λabs, λPL, and spectral shapes of the V- and Y-shaped compounds
were almost identical to those of the previously reported linear analogues 1a and 1b,10b indicating
that the presence of the isophthalate or 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate
central core in compounds V-3 and Y-4 had
no effect on their absorption and PL properties in dilute solution.
As can be seen in Figure 3C, the PL of V-3 and Y-4 in CH2Cl2 solution was observed to be an intense deep
blue by the naked eye; their PL colors were quantitatively visualized
using the CIE diagram (Figure 3D). Moreover, the difference between λabs and λPL on the energy
scale, which is called the Stokes’ shift,21 was relatively large, ranging from 5550 to 5672 cm–1, which may be because of the excited state relaxation
from locally excited to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states
caused by stabilization through the solvent reorientation.

To
confirm that the PL of the present V- and Y-shaped compounds
originated from the ICT state, we evaluated the solvatochromic PL
properties of the propylene-linker compounds V-3a and Y-4a as a selected example; their PL behavior was measured
in five more solutions of ethyl acetate (AcOEt), acetone, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO), and acetonitrile (MeCN), which have different polarities,
and the parameter ET(30) was used as a
quantitative measure of solvent polarity.22 The PL spectra of these compounds in different solvents and the
CIE diagram of the PL color are shown in Figure 4A,C.

Figure 4 (A,C) Normalized PL spectra of V-3a and Y-4a in AcOEt (blue), CH2Cl2 (light blue), acetone
(purple), DMF (yellow), DMSO (red), and MeCN (green). Values in parentheses
are the ET(30) value, which is an indicator
of solvent polarity. Inset: CIE diagram calculated from the PL spectra.
(B,D) Lippert–Mataga plot calculated from the physical properties
of the solvent and the dipole moment change (μe – μg) between
ground state and excited state derived from the Lippert–Mataga
plot.

As shown in Figure 4A,C, both V-3a and Y-4a showed PL in a
more polar-solvent acetone (ET(30) = 42.2),
DMF (ET(30) = 43.2), DMSO (ET(30) = 45.1), and MeCN (ET(30) = 45.6), and their λPL values
in these solvents were expectedly shifted approximately 20–30
nm toward longer wavelengths in comparison with their λPL values in CH2Cl2 (ET(30) = 40.7), whereas the less polar solvent, AcOEt (ET(30) = 38.1), resulted in a short-wavelength
shift of ca. 20 nm. As a result of this emission wavelength shift,
a slight PL color change was observed depending on the solvent polarity
(inset of Figure 4A,C).
To gain additional experimental evidence for the PL from an ICT state,
the Stokes’ shift (νabs – νPL) was plotted as a function of the orientation
polarizability (Δf), which is known as a Lippert–Mataga
plot,23 to estimate the dipole moment (μe) in the excited state for V-3a and Y-4a. As shown in Figure 4B,D, the Stokes’ shift (νabs – νPL) was
found to exhibit a relatively linear relationship to the Δf of the solvent by means of linear approximation with a
least-square method. The difference in the dipole moment (μe – μg) between the ground state and the excited state, which could
be calculated from the slope of the linear approximation, was found
to be 24.3 D for V-3a and 26.7 D for Y-4a, respectively. On the basis of the ground-state dipole moment (μg) calculated using a density functional theory (DFT) in Gaussian
09 (Figures S35 and S36),24,25 both compounds clearly possessed a large dipole moment in the excited
state: μe = 28.2 D for V-3a and 31.3
D for Y-4a. As a consequence, it can safely be concluded
that the PL behavior of the V- and Y-shaped compounds occurred through
radiative deactivation from an ICT state.26

PL Behavior in the Solid State
To investigate the PL
behavior of the present V- and Y-shaped compounds in condensed phases,
their PL spectra were measured in the solid state after recrystallizing
the compounds from a CH2Cl2/MeOH (1:1) mixed
solvent system. Figure 5 shows the PL spectra, photographs of the compounds under UV irradiation,
and the CIE diagram of the PL colors. The photophysical data are tabulated
in Table 3.

To our delight, all of the compounds with V- and Y-shaped
molecular
geometry exhibited PL behavior, even in the solid state, with moderate
PL efficiency (ΦPL). The PL spectra
were found to be completely different from those in dilute solution;
not only were the spectral bands significantly broadened, but also
the λPL values in the solid state
showed long-wavelength shifts of 10–50 nm compared to those
in the solution state (Figure 5A). The broadening of the PL band in the solid state is a
typical phenomenon related to various intermolecular interactions
formed in condensed phases, which can be clearly understood from the
dramatic difference of the excitation spectra for the solid and solution
states (Figure S33). The very different
excitation spectra in the solid state strongly suggest the existence
of multiple molecular aggregates with various intermolecular interactions
in the excited states. As shown in Figure 5B, all of the compounds exhibited light-blue
PL visible to the naked eye under UV irradiation (λex = 365 nm); the PL color is quantitatively plotted in
the CIE diagram (Figure 5C). Moreover, compared to the solid-state PL spectra of the linear
propoxy-containing 1a, the PL spectra of both propylene-linker
compounds V-3a and Y-4a were slightly shifted
toward the long-wavelength region, whereas the PL band for the hexylene-linker
compounds V-3b or Y-4b showed a shift toward
shorter wavelength or remained almost the same in comparison with
their linear analogue 1b, which contains a hexyloxy flexible
chain. However, the specific origin of the shifts in the emission
maxima remains unclear, and we are not able to propose a reasonable
explanation at present.

Temperature-Dependent PL Behavior in LC Phases
As mentioned
previously, the compounds V-3 and Y-4 were
found to be thermotropic LC compounds that exhibited LC phases, specifically,
NX and/or N phases, between the Cr and Iso phases, which
indicates that the formation of the LC phase may cause switching behavior
of the PL induced by a dramatic change in the molecular aggregation.
To investigate the influence of thermal stress on the PL, we subsequently
focused on temperature-dependent PL behaviors through the Cr ⇄
LC phase transition. The PL behavior of the hexylene-linker compounds V-3b and Y-4b was evaluated as a selected example
using an absolute quantum yield spectrometer with a temperature-control
unit, and the PL spectra for temperatures of 45–180 °C
during the second cooling process are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Temperature-dependent PL behavior of (A) V-3b and
(B) Y-4b during the second cooling process. Gray: crystalline,
green: NX, blue: N, and red: Iso phase.

For V-3b, during the first heating–cooling
cycle between 45 and 180 °C, the emission maximum wavelength
(λPL) in the Cr phase shifted to
444 nm (a long-wavelength shift of 11 nm, Figure S34, and Table S2); this shift may
have been induced by the reformation of molecular aggregation via
the fluidic N phase at 180 °C. In the subsequent second heating
from 45 to 180 °C, λPL was
observed to shift toward the shorter wavelength region by 14 nm, resulting
in a λPL of 430 nm at 180 °C,
and the PL efficiency (ΦPL) also
dropped from 0.18 at 45 °C (Cr) to 0.09 at 180 °C (N). Interestingly,
as shown in Figure 6A, during the second cooling from 180 to 45 °C, the λPL value completely recovered to 444 nm
and was accompanied by the recovery of the PL efficiency (ΦPL = 0.18). In the case of Y-4b, similarly, the λPL and ΦPL values were observed to change with
the temperature from 415 nm (ΦPL = 0.011) at 180 °C to 455 nm (ΦPL = 0.043) at 45 °C (Figure 6B and Table S3). The observed temperature-dependent PL behavior suggested that
the phase transitions among the Cr → NX →
N phases induced the appearance of fluidity with directional anisotropy
and dramatically altered intermolecular interactions, resulting in
changes in the PL properties, for example, λPL and ΦPL. Notably,
a significant decrease in ΦPL during
the heating process is a typical phenomenon because of the significant
promotion of nonradiative deactivation through the dynamic molecular
motions induced by thermal energy.

In terms of practical application
to thermosensing materials, for
example, fluorescence thermometers,27 at
this stage, it would be still challenging to apply the compounds V-3b and Y-4b in fluorescence thermometers because
of their insufficient PL efficiencies and narrow PL wavelength shifts.
However, the fact that the PL properties of V-3b and Y-4b did not change significantly during the repeated heating–cooling
processes can confidently be attributed to their LC characteristics,
which allow their aggregated structures to be precisely tuned depending
on the thermal stimulus, which represents a significant advantage
for reusable fluorescence thermometers.

Conclusions
Novel
V- and Y-shaped organic compounds bearing two or three pentafluorinated
bistolane-based luminophores connected to the core by propylene or
hexylene linkers were successfully synthesized via a facile four-step
manipulation from readily accessible 4-[3-(methoxymethoxy)propyloxy]phenylacetylene
or 4-[6-(methoxymethoxy)hexyloxy]phenylacetylene. POM and DSC measurements
demonstrated that the present novel V- and Y-shaped compounds displayed
LC characteristics, which brought about the formation of a distinct
LC phase owing to their unique molecular geometry in comparison with
the previously reported linear analogue. The LC properties, for example, Tm, Tc, and the temperature
range for the LC phase, changed depending on the molecular geometry
as well as the length of flexible chain moiety, which could allow
control of the LC behavior by means of a precise tuning of the primary
molecular structure. In addition, both the V- and Y-shaped compounds
with the pentafluorinated bistolane-based luminophore showed PL properties
under various conditions, such as in solution and in the solid state.
The PL behavior, for example, λPL and ΦPL, was very similar for
all of the compounds, with a slight difference in the λPL being observed with changing molecular geometry or
the length of the flexible unit, which is likely because of the dramatic
change in the molecular aggregated structures in the solid state.
Notably, these compounds were found to emit PL even in LC phases,
with decreasing emission efficiency (ΦPL) at higher temperature, which clearly demonstrates that
the present V- and Y-shaped luminophores function as light-emitting
liquid crystals. Further improvement of the thermal sensitivity of
PL characteristics of the bistolane-type luminophores, including ΦPL and the maximum wavelength shift, could
lead to practical utilization as useful thermosensing materials, such
as fluorescence thermometers.

Methods
General
1H and 13C NMR spectra
were obtained using AVANCE III 400 NMR spectrometer (1H:
400 MHz and 13C: 100 MHz) in chloroform-d (CDCl3) (Bruker, Germany), and the chemical shifts are
reported in parts per million based on the residual proton signal
of the NMR solvent. 19F NMR (376 MHz) spectra were obtained
using AVANCE III 400 NMR spectrometer in CDCl3 with CFCl3 (δF = 0 ppm) as an internal
standard (Bruker, Germany). Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded using
the KBr method with FT/IR-4100 typeA spectrometer (JASCO, Japan);
all spectra are reported in wavenumbers (cm–1).
High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on JMS-700MS spectrometer
(JEOL, Japan) using the fast-atom bombardment (FAB) method.

Materials
Starting materials for the preparation of 1 were obtained
from the following commercial source; 4-bromophenol,
3-bromopropan-1-ol, 6-bromohexan-1-ol, chloromethyl methyl ether,
triethylamine, and pentafluoroiodobenzene were purchased from FUJIFILM
Wako Pure Chemical Corporation. Trimethylsilylacetylene was obtained
from Apollo Scientific Ltd. A palladium catalyst, that is, Cl2Pd(PPh3)2, was purchased from Aldrich
Fine Chemicals. PPh3 and CuI were also purchased from FUJIFILM
Wako Pure Chemical Corporation. Column chromatography was carried
out on silica gel (Wakogel 60N, 38–100 μm), and thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) analysis was performed on
silica gel TLC plates (Merck, Silica gel 60F254). All reactions
were carried out using dried glassware and magnetic stirrer bars.
Typical synthetic procedures for V-3a and Y-4a and spectral data for the V-3 and Y-4 are
described below. In the Supporting Information are summarized all synthetic procedures and spectral data for other
compounds.

Isophthalate (V-3a)
In a 100 mL two-necked round-bottomed
flask was placed 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoro-1-[2-[4-(2-(4-(3-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl)ethyn-1-yl)phenyl]ethyn-1-yl]benzene
(2a, 0.49 g, 1.1 mmol), isophthaloyl chloride (0.10 g,
0.52 mmol), and CH2Cl2 (48 mL). To the solution
was added slowly Et3N (1.3 mL, 9.4 mmol) at 0 °C,
followed by the addition of DMAP (12 mg, 98 μmol) in one portion.
The whole was stirred at room temperature. After 14 h, the resultant

crude product was then extracted with AcOEt (three times), and the
combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4, filtered, and the solvent was removed
using a rotary evaporator. The resulting residue was subjected to
column chromatography to obtain the title compound V-3a in 23% (0.12 g, 0.11 mmol) as a white solid.

X-ray Diffractometry
Powder XRD measurement was performed
using a Rigaku SmartLab (Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 20 °C intervals from 200
to 60 °C during the second cooling process.

Photophysical
Properties
UV–vis absorption spectra
were recorded using a JASCO V-500 absorption spectrometer (JASCO,
Japan). Steady-state PL spectra were obtained using a Hitachi F-7000
(Hitachi, Japan) or a JASCO FP-8500 fluorescence spectrometer (JASCO,
Japan). PL quantum yields (PLQYs) were estimated using a calibrated
integrating sphere system attached to a JASCO FP-8500 fluorometer.
PLQYs during the heating/cooling processes were measured by using
a Quantaurus-QY spectrometer (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan).

Thermal Properties
Phase-transition properties were
observed by POM using an Olympus BX53 microscope (Olympus, Japan)
equipped with a cooling and heating stage (Linkam Scientific Instruments,
10002L, UK). The thermodynamic behavior of each compound was determined
using DSC (SHIMADZU DSC-60 Plus, Shimadzu, Japan) at heating and cooling
rates of 5.0 or 10 °C min–1 for the V-shaped 3a and 3b and Y-shaped 4a and 4b.

Computation
All computations were
performed using DFT
with the Gaussian 09 (rev. C.01) program package,24 and the geometric optimizations were executed using the
CAM-B3LYP hybrid functional25 and the 6-31G(d)
basis set. Vertical excitations were also calculated using a time-dependent
DFT method at the same level of theory.
