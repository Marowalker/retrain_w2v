The
luminescence of coordination polymers of Pr3+, Nd3+, and Lu3+ with tetrafluoroterephthalate and camphorate,
[Ln2(Fbdc)3(DMF)2(H2O)]2 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Lu) and [Ln2(Camph)2(NO3)2(MeOH)]4 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Lu), was studied.
Ligand-centered and/or metal-centered emissions appear, which depend
on the excitation wavelength, ultimately allowing the emitted light
color to be adjusted. Low-efficiency ligand-to-metal energy transfer
leads to a difference between the excitation spectra of the tetrafluoroterephthalate-
and camphorate-Pr3+ compounds, arising from a primary filtering
effect on the ligand-centered excitation, by Pr3+ absorption.
A secondary inner filter effect significantly changes the shape of
the luminescence band, allowing a wide variation in the emission color,
producing, for instance, a purple color, which is not the normal spectral
emission. The low-efficiency energy transfer renders tetrafluoroterephthalate
and camphorate ineffective as traditional “antenna”
ligands for Pr3+ and Nd3+.

Introduction
Elevated current interest
in luminescent lanthanide complexes results
from their emission characteristics, i.e., the high purity and reproducibility
of their emission colors, which are necessary for the potential application
of these compounds as materials for sensors, biological markers, solid-state
lasers, components of luminescent films, and markers for protection
of documents against falsification.1 Lanthanide–organic
frameworks (LnOFs) constitute one of the most promising classes of
luminescent compounds.1−3 LnOFs usually contain at least two potential light-emitting
centers: an organic ligand and the Ln3+ ion. The occurrence
and intensity of luminescence arising from the linker ligand or metal
ion depends on their ability to absorb excitation energy, the probabilities
of ligand-to-metal and metal-to-ligand energy transfers, and the possibility
of radiationless deactivation of excited states. The relative efficiencies
of these processes and, hence, the emission quantum yields are strongly
dependent on the electronic structures of the organic ligand and the
Ln3+ ion and govern the luminescence spectrum of the compound.
This allows such compounds to cover almost the full visible spectral
range of emission color by appropriate combination of different ligands
and metals in the LnOFs. However, the prediction of luminescence characteristics
(intensity and color) of such compounds is as yet far from facile.

The stability of Ln3+-ion complexes with O-donor ligands,
combined with the wide variety of available carboxylates, has led
to the generation of a large number of LnOFs with aromatic carboxylates,4−6 terephthalate being a typical component of many known luminescent
LnOFs, such as {[Tb(bdc)1.5(H2O)]·(DMF)(H2O)}n (bdc2– =
terephthalate dianion),7 [Eu2(bdc)3(H2O)4]n,8 and [Ln2(bdc)3(H2O)(DMF)3]n (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu).9 These complexes,
including [Pr2(bdc)3(H2O)(DMF)3]n and [Nd2(bdc)3(H2O)(DMF)3]n, possess intense metal-centered emission, while bdc2– has a triplet state energy of 23 300 cm–1 and plays the role of an antenna ligand in these compounds.9 For this work, two different carboxylates were
chosen on the basis of the following points. It has been shown10,11 that, generally, substitution of C–H by C–F in ligands
leads to an enhancement of the luminescence intensity, so tetrafluoroterephthalate
(Fbdc2–) is used as a counterion in this study.
As the electronic structures of aliphatic and aromatic ligands differ
significantly, the emission properties of their Ln3+ complexes
thus also vary.3,12 The main reason for choosing
camphorate (Camph2–) was that its triplet state
energy is 23 700 cm–1,13 which is very close to the respective value for bdc2–.9 The triplet state energies
of tetrafluoroterephthalate (24 700 cm–1)13 and camphorate (23 700 cm–1)13 are both higher than the energies
of emission levels of most lanthanides, which display emission in
the visible and NIR regions; so camphoric acid, with its rigid cyclic
structure, can be considered in this sense as an appropriate aliphatic
analogue of tetrafluoroterephthalic acid. Moreover, lanthanide complexes
with these ligands, namely, [Pr(Fbdc)3(DMF)2(H2O)]214 and [Nd2(Camph)2(NO3)2(MeOH)]4,15 possess similar crystal structures,
with two-dimensional polymers formed by dinuclear “building
blocks” linked by −O2C–R–CO2– bridges in two directions (type 2B2 according to
the classification in ref (14)), arranged in almost “grid”-like layers.
This provides an additional resemblance between the tetrafluoroterephthalate
and camphorate dianions.

On the other hand, the lanthanide compounds
possessing luminescence
in the visible region, which have been most studied so far, are those
of Tb3+ and Eu3+, with green or red metal-centered
emission, respectively.1,16,17 To extend the luminescence color range by increasing the likelihood
of the additional appearance of ligand-centered emission, which may
lead to the production of different colors, longer-wavelength emitting
Pr3+ and Nd3+ and nonemitting Lu3+ ions have been chosen from the lanthanide row for this work. The
logic of such a choice is based on (i) the probable ligand-centered
emission of Lu3+ compounds, which acts as a luminescence
reference and (ii) the characteristic near-infrared (NIR) luminescence
of compounds of Pr3+ and Nd3+ and their just
weak (if any) metal-centered emission in the visible range, which
potentially leads to the appearance of ligand-centered luminescence.10,16,17 Moreover, amongst lanthanide
ions, Pr3+ and Nd3+ have the most intense absorption
due to their Laporte-forbidden f–f transitions,18 and in different spectral ranges: i.e., Pr3+ absorbs blue and orange light, and Nd3+ absorbs
in the green and orange regions. Thus, partial absorption of ligand
emission by Pr3+ and Nd3+ (i.e., inner filter
effects) may broaden the color range of ligand-centered emission.

Hence this work is based on the hypotheses/ideas that (i) the use
of longer-wavelength emitting Pr3+ and Nd3+ and
the nonemitting (reference 4f10) Lu3+ will lead to significant ligand-centered emission; (ii)
the consequent inner filter effects caused by Pr3+ and
Nd3+ will noticeably change the luminescence color range;
(iii) use of tetrafluoroterephthalate, rather than its nonfluorinated
analogue, will enhance the metal-centered emission because of suppression
of the vibrational relaxation associated with C–H bonds.

Therefore, the aims of this work are to describe the luminescence
of Pr3+, Nd3+, and Lu3+ coordination
polymers with tetrafluoroterephthalate and camphorate, [Ln2(Fbdc)3(DMF)2(H2O)]2 (LnFbdc, Ln = Pr, Nd, Lu) and [Ln2(Camph)2(NO3)2(MeOH)]4 (LnCamph, Ln = Pr, Nd, Lu), to provide an implicit contrast with the known
Eu and Tb systems,13 and to detect any
influence of the Ln3+ ions’ absorption in these
compounds on their ligand-centered emission and the color of the emitted
light.

Results and Discussion
Electronic Spectra of LnFbdc and LnCamph
Broad bands
in the UV region appear in all the complexes’ electronic spectra
(Figure 1b). These
bands are similar within each ligand’s series of metal complexes
and are assigned to absorption by the organic ligands (Figure 1a). For the LnFbdc complexes, ligand absorption (Fbdc2–) is due to
aromatic π → π* transitions,13,19 with a maximum around 280 nm, whereas for the LnCamph complexes, the Camph2– absorption13,20 displays three resolved components at 220, 260, and 290 nm, assignable
to the carboxylate π → π*, n → σ*,
and n → π* transitions, respectively.19

Figure 1 Diffuse reflectance spectra of (a) Gd3+-carboxylates13 and (b, c) LnFbdc and LnCamph. Band assignments were made by comparison of the spectra with known
ones for Pr3+ and Nd3+ compounds.21−25

Sharp bands characteristic of
Pr3+ and Nd3+ f–f transitions are present
in the spectra of the complexes
with these metals (Figure 1b,c). The positions and shapes of these bands are as commonly
seen in the electronic spectra of Pr3+ and Nd3+ compounds;21−24 the bands’ assignments are given in Figure 1b,c.

Photoluminescence Properties
The luminescence properties
of Ln3+ compounds depend substantially on the relative
positions of the ligand triplet level and the excited state of the
Ln3+ ion.1,4,17 The
Fbdc2– and Camph2– triplet level
energies have been determined earlier as 24 700(100) and 23 700(300) cm–1,13 respectively. These values are higher than the
excited level energies of Pr3+ (3P0, near 20 700 cm–1, 3P1, near 21 200 cm–1 and 1D2, near 16 400 cm–1)9,10,25 and of Nd3+ (4F3/2, near 11 300 cm–1);10,23 therefore, ligand-to-Ln3+ energy
transfer should be anticipated. In the case of Pr3+, this
transfer is associated with levels of the same multiplicity and hence
is allowed. It might be noted that reverse energy transfer from Pr3+ to ligand would also be allowed.

PrFbdc, NdFbdc, PrCamph,
and NdCamph Metal-Centered Emission
Metal-centered emission
is observed for PrFbdc, NdFbdc, PrCamph, and NdCamph. For
the Pr3+ complexes, this emission arises by excitation
at 445 nm, corresponding to the Pr3+-centered 3H4 → 3P2 transition (Figure 2). Since the Pr3+ ion possesses three emissive states, the interpretation
of its luminescence spectrum is hardly straightforward, but tentative
assignments may be made (Figure 3). The emission spectra of PrFbdc and PrCamph are similar (Figure 2) and display several Pr3+-centered bands
near 525, 610, and 640 nm corresponding to the 3P1 → 3H5, 3P0 → 3H6, and 3P0 → 3F2 transitions, respectively.25,26 In the spectrum of PrCamph, additional bands at 486
and 542 nm attributed to 3P0 → 3H4 and 3P0 → 3H5 are observed.25,26 The apparent absence
of these bands in the emission spectrum of PrFbdc can
be accounted for by their being overwhelmed by the more intense ligand
luminescence, which dominates this region. The Pr3+ emission’s
sharp lines contrast with the broad ligand emission bands. No NIR
(850–1500 nm) emission is observed for PrFbdc or PrCamph.

Nd3+ compounds
illustrating excitation and emission processes. Wavy lines indicate
nonradiative transitions.

In the excitation spectra (Figure 2) of PrFbdc and PrCamph measured
at the 3P0 → 3F2 transition emission maximum of Pr3+ ions (λem = 640 and 642 nm for PrFbdc and PrCamph, respectively), broad bands are observed in the UV region. These
are assigned to (i) the edge of the ligand absorption for Fbdc2– or Camph2– 13 (for PrFbdc or PrCamph, respectively)
and (ii) the Pr3+ 5d → 4f transitions.27,28 Although the excitation spectra of PrFbdc and PrCamph were measured for wavelengths related to Pr3+-centered emission, no Pr3+-centered luminescence was
observed upon excitation at wavelengths of the maxima in the excitation
spectra, i.e., λex = 317 and 370 nm for PrFbdc and λex = 367 nm PrCamph, vide infra.
This is a consequence of the ineffectuality of energy transfer from
the ligand to Pr3+ and the overlapping of Pr3+-centered and ligand-centered emission, so that the excitation spectrum
is the result of a simple superposition of Pr3+ and ligand
excitation spectra.

The excitation spectra of PrFbdc and PrCamph are somewhat dissimilar in the region typical
of Pr3+ absorption (440–500 nm): three minima are
found in the excitation
spectrum of PrFbdc, whereas three maxima appear at the
corresponding wavelengths in the spectrum of PrCamph.
The positions of these extrema coincide with the positions of the
f–f bands in the absorption spectrum (Figure 2).21,22,25 The presence of local minima in an excitation spectrum in what is
normally an absorption region is unusual. Their nature can be accounted
for by the interplay of two effects: (i) the lower intensity of ligand-centered
emission caused by a primary filtering effect of the Pr3+ ion: i.e., Pr3+ f–f transitions absorb significantly
in that same region where the ligand absorption is of relatively low
intensity29,30 and (ii) the normal maxima in the excitation
spectrum for a Ln3+ ion associated with its absorption.21,25 This rationalization is supported by (i) the absence of Pr3+ emission by excitation with λex less than 440 nm,
and (ii) by the broadening of the minima in the excitation spectrum.

Metal-centered emission is observed for both NdFbdc and NdCamph (Figure 4). Three bands near 895, 1060 and 1330 nm, which can
be assigned to the 4F3/2 → 4I9/2, 4F3/2 → 4I11/2, and 4F3/2 → 4I13/2 transitions (Figure 4), respectively, are seen in the luminescence spectra
of these complexes.31,32 In the excitation spectra of NdFbdc and NdCamph (monitored for 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 emission),
several sharp bands appear, attributable to Nd3+ absorption.23,33

nm (green), emission spectrum excited with λex =
310 nm (red), and diffuse reflectance spectrum (black) of NdFbdc. (b) Excitation spectrum monitored for λem = 1062
nm (green), emission spectrum excited with λex =
305 nm (red), and diffuse reflectance spectrum (black) of NdCamph.

It should be noted that the energy
gaps between the lowest potentially
emissive state and the highest spin–orbit (J) level of the nonfluorescent state are just 3900 cm–1 (3P0 → 1D2) or
6950 cm–1 (1D2 → 1G4) for Pr3+ and 5400 cm–1 (4F3/2 → 4I15/2) for Nd3+ ions.11,34 These energy gaps are
close to the first ligand O–H and C–H vibrational overtone
frequencies (6800 and 6000 cm–1 respectively),35 which usually leads to efficient nonradiative
deactivation processes.11,15,34 Although the Ln3+ in LnFbdc has a coordinated
water molecule, and in LnCamph a methanol molecule is
coordinated, all Pr3+ and Nd3+ complexes studied
here, nonetheless, display metal-centered emission.

LnFbdc and
LnCamph Ligand-Centered Emission
LnFbdc and LnCamph (Ln = Pr3+, Nd3+,
Lu3+) display a broad emission band (Δν1/2 > 3000 cm–1) in the 320–550
nm
region, attributed to ligand-centered UV-excited luminescence (Figures 5 and 6). Indeed, for the Lu3+ complexes, no sharp minima
or maxima are observed in conjunction with these bands (Figures 5 and 6); the corresponding emission band shape for the Pr3+ and
Nd3+ compounds is similar. This ligand-based emission assignment
is supported by the fact that Ln3+ f–f transitions
have narrow bands (Δν1/2 < 500 cm–1);18 near-UV/visible region charge-transfer
transitions are unusual for these ions, and these observed bands appear
in the same energy region within each ligand’s metal complexes.
The appearance of ligand-centered bands in the emission spectrum indicates
that ligand-to-metal energy transfer is ineffective. The different
positions of the emission bands in the spectra of LnFbdc with λex = 317 nm (λem = 350 nm)
and 370 nm (λem = 450 nm) may be caused by dominant
emission from the S1 and T1 excited states of
Fbdc2–, which also agrees with the estimated energies
for these levels.13

and LuFbdc (black) with (a) λex = 317
nm and (b) λex = 370 nm.

Figure 6 Ligand-centered emission spectra of PrCamph (green), NdCamph (red), and LuCamph (black) with λex = 367 nm.

Sharp minima are observed
on the ligand-centered emission bands
in the spectra of the Pr3+ and Nd3+ compounds,
which probably correspond to reabsorption of emitted light by Ln3+ ions, followed by deactivation of their excited state—i.e.,
a secondary inner filter effect.30,36,37 This may be observed when a compound’s emission
overlaps with some other moiety’s absorption and the emission
and absorption process probabilities are comparable. Since absorption
by Ln3+ ions is usually caused by Laporte-forbidden f–f
transitions and is not intense, only a minority of lanthanide ions
exhibit this effect,1,29,31,36−44 and usually it appears when organic species and lanthanide ions
are not chemically bonded (mechanical mixtures, doped diureasils,
or xerogels).1,29,37,40−44 To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few
examples where this effect has been observed in coordination compounds.31,36,38,39 Moreover, the inner filter effect caused by Ln3+ ions
usually appears as small dips on the organic fragment’s emission,
and little attention has been paid to their influence on the perceived
emission color. Nevertheless, if emission and absorption process probabilities
are comparable, the inner filter effect can significantly change the
shape of an emission band and, hence, the color of the emitted light,
and this may allow the production of colors, such as purple, which
are otherwise normally absent in the spectrum but obtainable by combining
red and blue, as an alternative to its production by additive combination
of emission wavelengths from two different, unconnected luminophores.

The colorimetric coordinates have been estimated for all spectra
in this work (Figure 7). These coordinates differ significantly among the ligand-centered
emission of the Pr3+, Nd3+, and Lu3+ compounds as a result of “tuning” of the color by
partial absorption of the emitted light. The emission color of NdFbdc depends significantly on the excitation wavelength,
and in the case of λex = 370 nm, it is purple, due
to absorption of green wavelengths by Nd3+ f–f transitions.
The luminescence colors of PrFbdc and PrCamph also vary with excitation wavelength, which is attributed to the
changeover from ligand-centered emission (λex = 317
or 370 nm) to a metal-centered one (λex = 445 nm),
as the spectra reveal. So for lanthanide compounds with Fbdc2– and Camph2– in this work, the emission color can
be tuned over a wide range by changing the metal ion and excitation
wavelength.

and LnCamph (b). 1—Ln = Pr, 2—Ln = Nd,

Conclusions
The luminescence properties of Pr3+ and Nd3+ coordination polymers with tetrafluoroterephthalic and camphoric
acid anions have been studied. The Pr3+ and Nd3+ compounds possess ligand-centered or metal-centered emission that
depends on the excitation wavelength and allows controllable changes
in the color of the emitted light. This is enabled by low-efficiency
ligand-to-metal energy transfer and shows that Fbdc2– and Camph2– are not very effective as traditional
“antenna” ligands for Pr3+ and Nd3+. In addition, an inner filter effect appears in the ligand-centered
emission for PrFbdc, NdFbdc, PrCamph, and NdCamph, which significantly changes the shape
of the emission band and allows variation of the emission color over
a wide range, producing a color (purple), which is not based on the
normal spectral emission. The excitation spectra of the tetrafluoroterephthalate-
and camphorate-Pr3+ compounds are significantly different,
which may arise from a primary filtering effect of Pr3+ absorption on the ligand-centered emission.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
Commercially available reagents
and solvents (Aldrich and UkrReaChim) were used without further purification.
Camphoric acid (H2Camph) and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid
(H2Fbdc) were purchased from Acros Organics and lanthanide
nitrates from Aldrich. C, H, N-microanalyses were performed with a
Carlo Erba 1106 analyzer. X-ray powder diffraction data were collected
on a Bruker X9 diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation). Diffuse reflectance
spectra were measured on a Specord M-40 at room temperature and were
recalculated to absorption using the Kubelka–Munk function.45,46 The photoluminescence measurements were performed for solid samples
of pure compounds at room temperature with a Horiba Jobin-Yvon Inc.
Fluorolog FL 3-22 luminescence spectrometer.

Synthesis and Crystalline
Constitution
[Ln2(Fbdc)3(DMF)2(H2O)]2 (LnFbdc, Ln = Pr, Nd,
Lu) were prepared as described previously,20 whereas the compounds, [Ln2(Camph)2(NO3)2(MeOH)]4 (LnCamph, Ln
= Pr, Nd, Lu), were obtained similarly to the complexes with
Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb.13 Crystal structures of LnFbdc and LnCamph have been described previously.14,15 The isomorphism of our LnFbdc and LnCamph with those calculated for the known coordination polymers, PrFbdc(14) and NdCamph,15 was confirmed by coincidence of their
X-ray powder patterns (Figure S1, Supporting
