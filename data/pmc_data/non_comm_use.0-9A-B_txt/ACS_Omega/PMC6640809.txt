Growth of Ge by molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) on top of the silicene
monolayer on the Ag(111) surface results in either a dispersed adlayer
or a two-dimensional (2D) ordered structure depending on the silicene
phase. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images show that the ordered
adsorbed Ge atoms on (3 × 3)Si domains occupy a position
directly on top of down atoms in the buckled silicene layer, similar
to the adatom positions on the Ge(111)-c(2 × 8) surface. By contrast,
no long-range ordering of Ge adatoms is observed on the  domain, possibly partly because of the
interference effects of the Ag substrate. Results herein suggest that
the deposited Ge atoms tend to build an additional three-dimensional
bulk layer on the silicene monolayer and that the growth of the 2D
germanene/silicene heterostructure may not be achieved in a straightforward
manner.

I Introduction
The rich electronic features
of graphene and its possible novel
applications have led to the extensive search for an equivalent of
graphene for silicon and germanium, that is, silicene and germanene.1−8 Germanene, silicene, and graphene share several very peculiar and
interesting electronic properties. The electrons near the K and K′ points of the Brillouin
zone behave as relativistic massless particles known as Dirac fermions.
Certainly, some differences exist between these 2D allotropes of the
group IV elements. For example, the honeycomb lattice of graphene
is fully planar, whereas the honeycomb lattices of freestanding germanene
and silicene are buckled.2,9 Additionally, because
of the larger atomic number of germanium and silicon as compared with
that of carbon and the buckling structure, germanene and silicene
have a much stronger spin–orbit coupling and consequently lead
to the opening of a small band gap of 1.55 and 23.9 meV at the Dirac
points, respectively.10 As a result, only
silicene and germanene can practically exhibit the quantum spin Hall
state.

Experimentally, silicene has been synthesized and observed
on various
substrates including Ag(111),7,11−16 ZrB2(0001),17 Al(111),18 and Ir(111).19 Because
of a strong interaction with the substrate, the silicene monolayer
is strongly modulated into a structure that is more complex than that
of the simple flat honeycomb organization. Examples of experimentally
observed structures on the most widely studied substrate Ag(111) include
(3 × 3)Si, , (4 × 4)Ag, , (3.5 × 3.5)Ag, and .12,16,20−22 The subscript “Ag” refers to the Ag(111)
surface lattice vectors; the subscript “Si” indicates
a possibly incommensurate silicene structure with respect to that
of Ag(111); and the Wood’s notation refers to the silicene
lattice vectors.

Similarly, germanene has been synthesized on
several metallic substrates
and MoS2.23 Li et al. reported
the growth of germanene on Pt(111) by germanium MBE at room temperature
(RT) followed by a 30 min annealing at 600–750 K.24 Using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED)
and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), they found a  ( for short) periodicity
with respect to
the Pt(111) lattice. A density functional theory (DFT) calculation
revealed that a  unit cell of a buckled
germanene 2D layer
is commensurate with a (3 × 3)Ge cell with respect
to germanene unit vectors,24 whereas Sumiya
et al. suggested
that the  reconstruction on Pt(111)
is actually a
surface alloy composed of Ge3Pt tetramers.25 Davila et al. have grown 1.0 ML germanene on Au(111) at
200 °C and identified three different phases using LEED: a  phase, a (3 × 3)Au phase,
and a  ( for short) phase.26 On the basis of STM observations and DFT calculations, the authors
attributed the  phase as a  germanene layer commensurate with a  super cell. Bampoulis et al. studied the
growth of Pt on a Ge(110) substrate.27 The
deposition of a few monolayers of Pt on Ge(110) followed by annealing
at temperatures around 1100 K led to the formation of three-dimensional
(3D) nanocrystals on the Ge(110) substrate. The surface of the 3D
crystals had a buckled honeycomb structure, which was suggested to
be germanene. On the Al(111) surface, Deviraz et al. found a (3 ×
3) phase with respect to the Al(111) lattice vector ((3 × 3)Al).4 Using DFT calculations, a
buckled (2 × 2) germanene unit cell ((2 × 2)Ge) is shown to overlay on a (3 × 3)Al unit cell.

Formation of multilayer silicene, the silicon analogue of graphite,
upon increasing the Si coverage beyond a full layer has been explored
for Si growth on the Ag(111) surface. The structure observed is a
honeycomb-like ( for short) structure.28−31 However, several studies have
revealed that the so-called multilayer silicene on Ag(111) is actually
a thin film of bulklike silicon
and that the  surface is chemically
the same as that
on Ag/Si(111)-.32−37 Similar efforts have been made for the synthesis of few-layer germanene.
For example, Dávila et al. performed the MBE growth of Ge on
Au(111) at ∼200° and found that a  reconstructed germanene cell coincides
with an (8 × 8) supercell of Au(111).26

Recently, the rapid advance of the research on 2D materials
has
led to the fabrication and device applications of various vertical
and horizontal heterostructures based on these atomically thin crystals.
Tunneling diodes with negative differential resistance, tunneling
transistors, photovoltaic devices, and so on have been demonstrated
to be operational.38−40 Also, the strain and the breaking of sublattice symmetry
between the heterostructures of silicene, germanene, and graphene
often enlarge the energy band gap by tens of meV,9 which can help the realization of quantum spin Hall effects
at RT. This study initiates an
attempt to grow vertical heterostructures of silicene and germanene.
We have performed Ge growth by MBE on top of the silicene monolayer
on the Ag(111) surface and found that, on the (3 × 3)Si silicene domains, Ge adatoms coalesce into a 2D ordered overlayer
with the same (3 × 3)Si superstructure. In contrast,
no long-range ordering of Ge adatoms is observed on the  domains. The atomic model of the observed
features suggests that the bonding sites of Ge adatoms are similar
to those observed on the Si(111)-(7 × 7) surface. No germanene
is formed under the explored growth conditions.

II Experimental
Details
The STM experiments were conducted in an ultrahigh
vacuum (UHV)
chamber, with a base pressure of 2 × 10–10 Torr.
The Ag(111) substrate, with a surface area of 16 × 3 mm2, was cleaned by several cycles of Ar+ sputtering (1.0
kV and 1 × 10–5 Torr) and subsequent annealing
by electron beam bombardment at 500 °C for 20 min. Temperature
calibration of the sample above RT was performed by bringing a tiny
type-K thermocouple into contact with the sample. Below RT, a type-T
thermocouple was used. The error in temperature measurements was estimated
to be within ±10 °C. Silicon was deposited in situ at a
rate of ∼0.05 ML per min by passing a direct current through
a piece of Si wafer located about 10 cm away from the Ag(111) substrate
maintained at 250 °C, which is much lower than the typical homoepitaxial
growth temperature for Si. The coverage of Si is specified in terms
of the site density of the Ag(111)-(1 × 1) surface: 1 ML = 1.38
× 1015 cm–2. Ge atomic vapor is
generated from an e-beam-heated crucible. The sample LT-STM measurement
was carried out at 77 K in a constant-current mode.

III Results and Discussion
The STM images taken after the deposition
of nominal 0.8 ML Si
at a substrate temperature of ∼190 °C
show that the surface is largely covered by a silicene monolayer with
the  ( for short) structure (∼80% of surface
area), the (3 × 3)Si structure (∼15%), and
other minor structures (a few percentage). Both (3 × 3)Si and  phases consist of a complete
silicene lattice
with different ordering in the buckling of Si atoms.20,41Figure 1a depicts
a surface area that consists of (3 × 3)Si on the left
side of the image and  on the right side. The lattice constants
as measured by the Fourier transform analysis (Figure 1b) are ∼1.16 ± 0.03 and ∼1.05
± 0.03 nm for (3 × 3)Si and , respectively. The angle between the two
pairs of unit cell vectors is ∼18.3 ± 1.0°. Aside
from the smaller intrinsic  ordering, an apparent moiré-pattern-like
superstructure is also discernible, likely because of the lateral
interference effects between the substrate and the overlayer lattice.20,42 All of the above-mentioned observations are consistent with the
previous experimental findings.

point to first-order diffraction spots corresponding to the unit cell
vectors in the insets of (a).

After examining the silicene monolayer in the LN2-cooled
STM chamber
shroud, the substrate was transferred to the preparation chamber for
Ge deposition and back to the STM stage for imaging. The manipulator
in the preparation chamber has no cooling setup, and the sample warms
up from ∼77 K to RT during the sample transport to and on the
manipulator. Our
calibration shows that the sample temperature increases after the
sample transport changes from about −100 to −7, −1,
and 5 °C, respectively, for a deposition time of 20, 30, and
40 min. STM images taken after 30 min of Ge deposition (Figure 2a) show that Ge atoms form
patches of ordered 2D islands on the (3 × 3)Si areas,
but not on the  areas. On the  areas, Ge atoms cluster into 3D islands
around the edges. The formation of 2D Ge overlayer on the Si film
suggests that the Ge adatoms upon adsorption are mobile well below
RT. As shown in Figure 2b , the areas of the ordered 2D islands on the (3 × 3)Si areas increase initially with the coverage. However,
as shown in Figure 2c, further additions of Ge do not cover the entire surface but cluster
into 3D islands and even patches of the (3 × 3)Si areas
are still available for adsorption. Because the sample temperature
increases to near RT at a later part of the 120 min deposition process,
the 3D island formation can also be due in part to the enhanced mobility
of Ge adatoms at around RT.

Figure 2 STM images of the surface shown in Figure 1 after a (a) 30 min,
(b) 60 min, (c) 120
min deposition of Ge. Vs = −1.50
V; It = 1.0 nA; size: (a) 60 × 60
nm2 and (b,c) 60 × 30 nm2. Regions labeled  are surface areas with the  structure. Typical heights for the 3D Ge
clusters (i.e. bright protrusions in (b) and (c)) are between ∼0.25
and ∼0.45 nm and roughly proportional to their lateral size.

Figure 3a,b shows
the zoomed-in images on the (3 × 3)Si and  areas, respectively. In Figure 3a, patches of ordered adsorbates
are clearly seen on the upper right corner. The white rhombus mesh
outlines the (3 × 3)Si lattice net. In each unit cell,
a 
protrusion labeled VS can be located on one side of the
half-unit cell (HUC), indicating that the overlayer has the same (3
× 3)Si structure as that of the silicene monolayer
underneath. Some protrusions (labeled VC, H′, showing
reddish rings in Figure 3a) occupy different positions in a (3 × 3)Si cell
and have larger apparent heights by about 0.6 Å than that of
most protrusions VS in the periodic lattice as shown in Figure 3c. All filled-state
and empty-state images taken at bias voltages between 0.50 and 1.50
V exhibit similar features and the apparent height of adsorbates.
The VC and H′ protrusions are typically more isolated
from other adsorbates. These observations indicate that the VC and H′ adsorbates have configurations different from
that of VS and that adsorbate–adsorbate interactions
play a role in the formation of the ordered structure and in the bonding
configurations of adsorbates. By contrast, each of Ge adsorbates in
the  domain, as shown in Figure 3b, occupies a slightly
different position
in each HUC. It is likely that the interference effects between the
substrate and the silicene lattice lead not only to the moiré-pattern-like
superstructure but also to the adsorption configurations of Ge adatoms.

Figure 3 14.0 ×
10.0 nm2 zoomed-in images on the (a) (3
× 3)Si and (b)  areas, areas of same surface shown in Figure 2a. The protrusions
labeled VS, VC, and H′ are Ge adsorption
sites. The white rhombus mesh is a guide for eyes for the unit cells. Vs = −1.50 V; It = 1.0 nA (c) Z-height profile along the solid line
in (a).

To elucidate the atomic configuration
of Ge adsorbates, a comparison
of the atomic model and atomic-resolved images is needed. Figure 4a shows that the
(3 × 3)Si phase has a characteristic hexagonal arrangement
of triangular structures around dark centers. Each unit cell consists
of two equilateral triangular HUCs, and each HUC consists of three
protrusions. In the well-developed (3 × 3)Si structure
model shown in Figure 4b, the three protrusions in each HUC in the STM images correspond
to the upper-buckled Si atoms [labeled US (S denoting “side”)
and UC (C denoting “corner”)], which are
roughly on top of the Ag atoms. The six blue balls surrounding the
three edges of each HUC represent lower-buckled Si atoms (3 DS and 3 DC). Thus, in the total 18 Si atoms in each
(3 × 3) UC, only six are upper-buckled.

6.2 nm2 zoomed-in image on the (3 ×
3)Si areas for the surface shown in Figure 2a and an overlay of the ball-stick model
of the silicene structure. Each white rhombus encloses a unit cell. Vs = −1.50 V; It = 1.0 nA (b) top view of a unit cell for the (3 × 3)Si honeycomb lattice of monolayer silicene on Ag(111). Red and blue
circles represent the upper (U) and lower (D) basis atoms, respectively.
Subscripts C and S denote “corner” and “side”,
respectively. The position at the center of the three upper-buckled
atoms in a HUC is labeled H (denoting “hollow”). H′
is located at the midway between H and UC. The gray mesh
represents 4 × 4 the underlying Ag(111) lattice.

To identify the precise positions for the Ge adsorbates,
the (3
× 3)Si structure model is overlaid on the STM image,
as shown in Figure 4a. All four protrusions near the middle left part can be seen located
close to the top of a lower-buckled atom near the boundaries between
two HUCs, that is, DS. This site, called VS,
or a side-valley site, is analogous to a T4 site on the
top bilayer of an ideal Si(111)-(1 × 1) bulk-terminated surface,43 or the Ge(111)-c(2 × 8) surface,44 which does not have a stacking-fault reconstruction
of Si(111)-(7 × 7). As shown in Figure 3c, a VS protrusion has an apparent
height of ∼0.7 Å above the (3 × 3)Si background
and a full width at half-maximum of ∼0.7 nm. The two values
are close to that observed for a Ge adatom on Si(111)-(7 × 7).45,46 As mentioned earlier, it exhibits one hump under various bias voltages.
Therefore, a VS protrusion likely consists of one adsorbed
Ge atom. Each adsorbed Ge in a VS site forms three bonds
with the surrounding US, UC, and DS atoms. It also interacts with the atoms directly below it (DS). On free-standing silicene, the valley site is a preferred
adsorption site for several transition metals.47 Zhao et al. have shown that a high-coordination site G,
which is near the midway between H and a hexagonal ring atom, has
the lowest energy for Ge adsorption on Si(111)-(7 × 7) and that
the T4 site has the second lowest one.46 By comparing the relative positions of the protrusions
in Figure 3a, it can
be established that the adsorption sites in the ordered (3 ×
3)Si areas are regular arrays of the VS site
and many dispersed
(reddish) adsorbates occupy the sites H′, which is also a high-coordination
site like a G site in Si(111). In other words, the bonding configurations
of adsorbed Ge atoms on the (3 × 3)Si areas of the
silicene monolayer near RT is similar to that found for Si(111)-(7
× 7). Apparently, the Ge adatom density on the (3 × 3)Si areas is quite low, with only one atom per (3 × 3)Si unit cell. The difference in Ge adsorption configurations
(a H′ site for an isolated Ge adatom and VS sites
for ordered arrays of Ge adatoms) and the low adatom density indicate
that substantial adsorbate–adsorbate interactions exist, likely
with the modifications of silicene monolayer upon adsorption.

IV Conclusions
In summary, we have studied the MBE growth
of Ge on the silicene
monolayer on the Ag(111) surface below RT. High-resolution LT-STM
images reveal the detailed adsorption configurations and very different
degrees of ordering on the two complete monolayer silicene phases:
(3 × 3)Si and . On the (3 × 3)Si silicene
domains, 2D ordered overlayer with the same superstructure is formed
below a surface coverage of ∼40%. STM images show that each
of the ordered adsorbed Ge atoms occupies a valley site, which is
directly above the down-atoms in the buckled silicene layer, similar
to the adatom positions on the Ge(111)-c(2 × 8) surface. The
atomic ratio of Ge and Si on this ordering phase is very low, only
1/18, suggesting a strong adsorbate–adsorbate interaction.
On the  phase, no apparent ordering of Ge adsorbates
is observed, possibly partly because of the interference effects between
the silicene layer and the Ag substrate. These observations suggest
that the adsorbed Ge adatoms tend to build a 3D bulk layer on silicene.
These results indicate that novel approaches are needed to realize
2D germanene/silicene heterostructures.
