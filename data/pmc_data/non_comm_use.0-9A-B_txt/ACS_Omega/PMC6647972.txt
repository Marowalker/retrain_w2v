Synthesis of a novel phosphorus and
triazole-functionalized flame-retardant
(FR) monomer (PTFM) using azide–alkyne “click”
reaction between triprop-2-ynyl phosphate and 2-azidoethanol that
can impart intumescent FR property to polyurethane foams (PUFs) has
been reported. Polyurethane triazole foams (PUTFs) were prepared using
the as-synthesized PTFM and a hydroxylated castor polyol with a hydroxyl
value of ∼310 mg KOH/g for application as reactive FR rigid
foams. PTFM and the castor polyol were characterized for structural
elucidation using Fourier transform infrared and 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR. PUTFs with a varying loading content
of PTFM were subjected to the lab-scale flame test, cone calorimetry
test, Underwriters Laboratory 94 Vertical burning test (UL 94V), and
limiting oxygen index (LOI) test. A significant increase in the char
yields, reduction in heat release rates, V-1 rating, and 27% of LOI
were observed for PUTFs compared to PUFs and proportional to the percentage
loading of PTFM. The cumulative effect of nitrogen and phosphorus
in PUTFs on their intumescent behavior was evident from the thermogravimetric
analysis and scanning electron microscopy micrographs, which were
further supplemented by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies,
indicating expulsion of N2 and overall improvement in compression
strength as well. Such environment-friendly reactive FRs can be good
replacements to the halogenated ones.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, development of nonhalogenated flame retardants
(FRs) has been an emerging area of research because of the blanket
ban on halogenated FRs in view of the environmental and health concerns.1,2 Organophosphorus-based FRs find scope as one of the alternatives
to halogenated ones.3 FRs can be either
added to the polymer as an additive or inserted into its backbone
during the course of polymerization popularly known as reactive FRs,
which offer the advantage of nonleaching. Typical reactive organophosphorus-based
FRs that have been reported are 2-carboxyethyl(methyl)phosphonic acid
and 2-carboxyethyl(phenyl)phosphonic acid in polyesters,4 bis(4-carboxyphenyl)phenyl phosphine oxide in
polyamides,5 and diethyl(methacryloyloxy)
methyl phosphonate and diethyl p-vinylbenzene phosphonate
in polyacrylates and vinylic group of polymers.6 Similarly, oligo(1,3-phenylenemethyl phosphonate), bis(aminophenyl)alkyl
phosphine oxide, and hyperbranched poly(aminomethyl phosphine oxide-amine)
were reported for use in epoxy resins,7,8 whereas in
polyurethanes, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)methyl phosphonate and 3,3′-(butylphosphoryl)dipropan-1-ol
have been used.3 Further, use of polypyrrole-functionalized
nanomagnetite for making epoxy nanocomposites and silicon-based polyborazine
with phenol-formaldehyde resin in FRs was also reported.9,10

Phosphorus-based reactive FRs with nitrogen are reported to
offer
synergistic effects and enhance flame retardancy,11,12 such as 2,2-diethyl-1,3-propanediol phosphoryl melamine, azide-terminated
phosphonate, alkyl/aryl phosphonates, and alkyne-terminated polyols
in rigid PU foams,13,14 hexa-[4-(glycidyloxycarbonyl)phenoxy]cyclotriphosphazene
in polyamide 6 polymers,15 amino-functionalized,
aromatic-substituted tricyclophosphazenes in poly(butylene terephthalate),16 and phosphorus, nitrogen, and silica FR polypropylene
systems.17 Further advantages of these
compounds emanating less smoke, vapors, and carbon monoxide gas under
combustion were highlighted.18,19 In order to achieve
this synergistic impact of flame retardancy, one can design a new
class of monomers with both phosphorus and nitrogen, which can be
incorporated in the backbone of the polymer by adapting suitable synthetic
organic chemistries. Among them, azide–alkyne “click”
chemistry is well recommended for its simple reaction conditions,
ease of solvent selection, higher yields, nil or fewer byproducts,
and so on.20,21 The 1,2,3-triazole moiety helps
in exclusion of nitrogen—a noncombustible gas upon combustion
that is useful in flame retardancy.22 Hence,
the design of a monomer with P and N that can be inserted into the
polymer chain will be beneficial in contributing to the FR properties
of polymer foams.23,24

In the present work, we
aimed to prepare a novel monomer [phosphorus-
and triazole-functionalized FR monomer (PTFM)] with P- and N-containing
moieties for imparting FR properties to polyurethane triazole foams
(PUTFs) for application as FR rigid foams. PTFM was prepared via azide–alkyne
click reaction under thermal conditions in the absence of a catalyst
yielding 1,4 and 1,5 isomers of triazole. The objective behind the
design of PTFM (Figure 1) has been (a) phosphate ester group for promoting char, (b) nitrogen-rich
1,2,3-triazole moiety for the swelling of char because of the release
of N2 gas and (c) hydroxyl groups for polymerization. PTFM
with varying contents was reacted with hydroxylated castor oil and
polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) to prepare PUTFs.
Polyurethane foam (PUF) with nil PTFM was also prepared for comparative
studies. All the foams were evaluated for FR performance by subjecting
to FR testing by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UL 94V, limiting
oxygen index (LOI) tests, cone calorimetric tests, and lab-scale flame
tests.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Thermal Analysis
The thermal stability
of the PUTFs and control foam (PUF) was evaluated by using TGA. The
onset decomposition temperature (TON),
25 and 50% weight loss temperatures, weight loss at 500 °C, and
percentage of weight residue at 700 °C of all the samples are
tabulated in Table 1, and the decomposition pattern can be seen in Figure 2. The small decomposition with negligible
weight loss is observed at 50–100 °C, which corresponds
to the removal of adsorbed moisture and traces of other solvents.25 The TON of PUF is
noticed at 277 °C, whereas the TON values of PUTF-50 and PUTF-100 are noticed at 237 and 240 °C,
respectively. The TON values of PUTFs
were found to be low compared to the TON of PUF. This is due to the fact that phosphorus-containing polyurethanes
are thermally less stable than pure polyurethane as the phosphorus
segment present in PUTFs is easily decomposable. In the next step,
a thermally stable polyphosphate layer is formed as a molten layer
that reduces the rate of decomposition of the second step corresponding to urethane segment decomposition.26 The phosphate layer formed acts as a physical
obstruction that avoids heat and mass transfer between the condensed
and gas phase.13 Even though the difference
in TON between PUTF 50 and PUTF 100 is
not significant, the increase in char yields and the decrease in total
weight loss were found to be proportional to the percentage of PTFM.
The decomposition curve between 300 and 350 °C is observed in
all the foam specimens and corresponds to depolymerization of polyurethane,
which involves cleavage of urethane linkages wherein the production
of moderately less volatile polyol constituents and production of
nitrogen-rich volatiles take place.27 The
decomposition between 300 and 400 °C is attributed to the decomposition
of polyol.18,28 The rate of decomposition pattern
for the PUTFs was noticed to be lower than for PUF, which may be attributed
to the formation of phosphoric acid derivatives from PTFM and their
interaction with polyurethane to form stable intermediates. The char
yields are found at 3.68, 20.84, and 30.82 wt % corresponding to PUF,
PUTF-50, and PUTF-100, respectively. The findings clearly indicate
a significant rise in the char residue for PUTFs compared to PUF and
support their FR performance with respect to PTFM loading.

2.2 Lab-Scale Flame Test
The lab-scale
flame test was performed on foam specimens prior to ASTM standards
of flammability tests such as UL 94V, LOI, and cone calorimetry. Foam
specimens with dimensions 40 × 40 × 40 mm3 (length
× width × thickness) were taken, and a butane flame was
applied continuously over all the foam specimens for two times, viz.,
first ignition (t1, 15 s) and second ignition
(t2, 15 s). In the case of control foam,
there was no second ignition (t2) as it
had shown melt dripping after the first ignition, whereas PUTF-50
and PUTF-100 were ignited two times (t1, t2) and it was observed that after t1, both the PUTFs self-extinguished immediately.
After t2, PUTFs started to burn and there
was no dripping observed for both PUTF-50 and PUTF-100. It was observed
that the burning took place on the periphery of the foams but not
in the internal parts. Moreover, it was observed that the burned thickness
of the foam was lowered for PUTF-100 than for PUTF-50, which could
be due to the higher weight percentage of PTFM in PUTF-100. The dripping
pattern of PUF and peripheral burning of PUTF-50, as well as PUTF-100,
can be clearly seen from Figure 3.

and (c)
PUTF-100.

2.3 UL 94
Vertical Burning Test and LOI Test
The flame-retarding behavior
of PUF and PUTFs was studied by UL
94V analysis. According to UL 94V, materials are classified into three
major types such as V-0, V-1, and V-2.29 In the present study, all the PUTFs are classified as V-1, whereas
no rating is given to PUF as it shows complete melt dripping over
combustion. Thus, the control PUF does not exhibit FR property. The
total time taken for flaming combustion was recorded as 46 s for PUF
with single ignition (t1), whereas PUTFs
were subjected to two ignitions t1 and t2 and the average values of flaming combustion
times for five samples of PUTF-50 and PUTF-100 are 44 and 38 s, respectively.
This pattern of combustion behavior with less than 30 s for PUTFs
per ignition complies with the requirement for V-1 rating and hence
implies their superior FR performance compared to PUF. The observations
and ratings of UL 94V are tabulated in Table 2.

According to LOI standards, the
materials with less than or equal
to the oxygen content value 21% are flammable.30 The measured LOI values of PUF and PUTFs are listed in Table 2, and it is found that the PUTFs have LOI
values of 23 and 27% corresponding to PUTF-50 and PUTF-100, respectively,
whereas it is found that the control PUF has the LOI value of 19%
and is flammable. The increase in LOI values for PUTFs reflects enhanced
FR property with respect to the higher quantity of PTFM in the foam.

2.4 Flammability and Cone Calorimeter Studies
The flammability of PUF and PUTFs was studied with the help of
cone calorimeter experiments. The data of the peak heat release rate
(PHRR), total heat release (THR), average heat release rate (AHRR),
time to ignition (TTI), carbon monoxide (CO) yield, carbon dioxide
(CO2) yield, total smoke release (TSR), and total smoke
production (TSP) were obtained from cone calorimeter studies and are
tabulated in Table 3. The time taken for igniting the sample is one of the parameters
to evaluate the flame retardancy of a material.31 Materials with higher TTI values have good FR property.
The TTI of the control PUF is 3 s, whereas the TTI values for PUTF-50
and PUTF-100 are 8 and 12 s, respectively. The delay in TTI was solely
credited to the loading of PTFM into PUTFs and was directly related
to the loading percentage of PTFM. Further, the decrease in PHRR values
from PUF to PUTFs also indicates the contribution of PTFM to FR property.
The reduction in PHRR of PUTF-50 and PUTF-100 is about 60 and 61%,
respectively, compared to that of the control PUF. From the HRR profile
of Figure 4, it can
be observed that PUTF-50 releases heat up to 200 s, whereas PUTF-100
releases heat up to 100 s only. This indicates that PUTF-100 extinguishes
the flame in less time compared to PUTF-50 and is attributed to the
high loading of PTFM into PUTF-100.

PUTF-100	82.65	235.80	25.18	0.0091	0.18	761.7	6.7	13.0	12	
In addition, the AHRR values of PUTFs
are found to be low compared
to that of PUF and are directly proportional to the weight percentage
of PTFM loading. The overall reduction in AHRR of PUTF-50 and PUTF-100
compared to that of the control PUF is about 70 and 86%, respectively.
The THR of PUTF-100 is found at 13.0 MJ/m2, whereas PUTF-50
and PUF are found at 28.3 and 59.5 MJ/m2, respectively.
From the values, it is found that the reduction of THR is 77% for
PUTF-100 and 53% for PUTF-50 with reference to PUF. The THR patterns
of the foam specimens can be seen from Figure 4. The reduction in PHRR and THR values of
PUTF-100 is due to the higher loading of PTFM, in which the phosphate
group, as well as triazole, has shown an intumescent and cumulative effect in firefighting mechanism
(Figure 5).

Figure 5 Photographs
of char residues of foams after the cone calorimeter
test of (a) PUF, (b) PUTF-50, and (c) PUTF-100.

The yields of combustible products, viz., CO and CO2, are found to be directly proportional to HRR. From Table 3, it is evident that the yields
of CO and CO2 were decreased with an increase in the loading
of PTFM from control to PUTF-100. The reduction in TSR and TSP of
PUTFs over control PUF is attributed and is directly proportional
to the percentage loading of PTFM. The TSR profile of foam specimens
is depicted in Figure 6, and the values are found to be 1497.6, 1258.0, and 761.7 m2/m2 corresponding to PUF, PUTF-50, and PUTF-100,
respectively. Moreover, a similar trend has been observed in TSP values
wherein 13.2 m2 is attributed to control PUF, whereas 11.1
and 6.7 m2 are accredited to PUTF-50 and PUTF-100, respectively.
It is noted that the percentage of reduction in TSR compared to that
in control PUF of PUTF-100 is 49.14% and of PUTF-50 is 15.99%. The
percentage of reduction in TSP of PUTF-100 and PUTF-50 compared to
that of PUF is 49.24 and 15.90%, respectively. This could be due to
the intumescent effect of PTFM that involves phosphate char formation
as well as exclusion of nitrogen gas from the triazole moiety,22 which in sequence forms a foaming char at the
cell walls of the foam upon burning. This could reduce the pore size
of foam and retards the permeability of combustible gases as well
as the product gases (CO, CO2). This mechanism is supplemented
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of foam specimens before and after the
cone calorimeter test (Figures 7 and 8). Photographs of char residues
of foams after the cone calorimeter test can be seen from Figure 5.

specimens.

specimens (a) before exposure to flame
and (b) after exposure to flame.

2.5 XPS Analysis
The N (1s) and P (2p)
signals were recorded by XPS for the foam specimens [before (A) and
after burning (B)] with their corresponding binding energies and intensities
shown in Figure 7,
and the values of N (1s) are tabulated in Table 4. The spectrum for all A foams exhibits the
peaks at the binding energy ∼398 eV corresponding to N (1s)
of urethane (−NH−) and triazole at (=N−).32,33 The exclusion of nitrogen gas from PUTF upon combustion was confirmed
by the significant decrease in the intensity of N (1s) peak in PUTF’s
B samples (PUTF-50 = 21 824.13 cps and PUTF-100 = 17 577.16
cps) proportional to the content of PTFM in them, while negligible
change is seen for the B sample of PUF. Thus, the XPS findings clearly
correlate the advantage of the triazole ring in the PUTFs in support
of the cumulative contribution from both N and P on the intumescent
behavior and FR property.

2.6 Morphology and Compression Strengths
From the SEM micrographs,
it is observed that the control PUF exhibits
an open cell structure, whereas PUTFs exhibited no specific cell structure
having both open cell and closed cells. This could be due to the incorporation
of PTFM into PUTFs. The higher loading of PTFM into the polyurethane
network led to the rupture of the cell wall, which results in an increase
in a cell window. It was also observed that the size of the cell window
of PUTF-100 is greater than that of PUTF-50 and PUF. The cell window
of PUF was noticed at ∼150 μm, whereas PUTF-50 and PUTF-100
have the cell window at ∼300 and ∼450 μm, respectively.
The intumescent behavior of PUTFs was clearly observed by SEM analysis
and can be seen in Figure 8. The thickness of strut of PUTFs was increased upon burning,
and the thickness is highest for PUTF-100 over PUTF-50. This observation
reiterates the concept of the cumulative effect of nitrogen and phosphorus
as explained earlier. The control foam exhibited no intumescent behavior,
which is due to the melt dripping upon exposure to flame in which
shrinkage of cells was observed. SEM micrographs of all foam specimens
are depicted in Figure 8.

The densities of the foams were measured at foam specimens
with 40 × 40 × 40 mm3 (length × width ×
thickness) dimensions by weight to volume ratio. The densities of
the foams are 30.29, 50.65, and 82.65 kg/m3 corresponding
to PUF, PUTF-50, and PUTF-100, respectively, and are directly proportional
to the loading of PTFM into PUTFs. This is due to the dual role of
PTFM that acts not only as the FR monomer but also acts as the cross-linker
in the foam formation. Thus, the increasing density and flame retardancy
are solely credited to PTFM only. From Figure 9, it can be seen that the compression strengths
of the foam specimens increased and are directly proportional to the
loading of PTFM. The stress values experienced at 10% deformation
of the foam samples are 0.076, 0.134, and 0.144 MPa corresponding
to PUF, PUTF-50, and PUTF-100, respectively. The density effect on
stress has been reflected as 0.175 and 0.138 MPa for PUTF-100 and
PUTF-50, respectively, at 25% deformation while insignificant at 10%.
The typical stress (σ) and strain (ε %) curves of foam
specimens are shown in Figure 9.

3 Conclusions
A novel phosphorus- and
triazole-containing FR reactive monomer
(PTFM) was prepared via azide–alkyne “click”
chemistry, and its flame retardancy was studied with respect to its
loading into PU foams. Increase in char yields for PUTFs above 700
°C was inferred from the characteristic char formation by the
phosphate group upon combustion. The intumescent behavior due to the
cumulative impact of N in the 1,2,3-triazole moiety and phosphorus
in PTFM was clearly observed in terms of reduction in THR, PHRR, and
HRR. The intumescent behavior of PUTFs was further supplemented by
the foaming char formation and was also observed in SEM micrographs
and XPS analysis. The lab-scale flammability experiments also substantiated
the results obtained from both SEM and cone calorimetry. The flame
retardancy of PUTFs was supported by the V-1 rating of UL 94V and
27% of LOI. Hence, the synthesized novel reactive FR monomer (PTFM)
opens a wide scope of its application as an eco-friendly alternative
to FR additives and halogenated FRs in rigid PU foams.

4.3 Synthesis
of Triprop-2-ynyl Phosphate
In a 500 mL round-bottom flask,
propargyl alcohol (10.9 g, 0.195
mol) and triethyl amine (19.7 g, 0.195 mol) were taken along with
100 mL of toluene. Then, the reaction mixture was heated at 50 °C
for 30 min with continuous stirring to get a clear solution. Later,
the reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C, and phosphoryl chloride
(10 g, 0.065 mol) was added dropwise along with 20 mL of toluene.
Then the reaction mixture was left overnight with stirring at room
temperature. The resultant mixture was filtered, and toluene was removed
from the filtrate under reduced pressure. The orange colored liquid
product with 65% yield was collected (Scheme 1).

4.4 Synthesis
of 2-Azidoethanol
In our
previous publication,34 we reported the
synthesis of 2-azidoethanol. In brief, in a round-bottom flask, 2-chloro
ethanol and sodium azide were dissolved in water. Sodium azide must
be added in small portions while stirring to avoid accidents as it
is an exothermic reaction. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 24
h with continuous stirring. Later, the product was extracted with
dichloromethane, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure.
Once the compound was isolated, it was immediately stored in dark
and below room temperature to avoid accidents as the product has high
N/C ratio (3:2).

was heated at 85 °C for 12 h. The product settled at the bottom
of the flask was separated by decanting the solvent, and the viscous
product was washed with ethyl acetate, followed by chloroform. The
trace amounts of solvents were removed by high vacuum, and the product
was collected with ∼98% yield. The reaction was monitored by
FTIR as the peak at 2100 cm–1 (azide stretching

three-neck round-bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer,
dry castor oil (10 g, 0.033 mol) was taken. Then, a mixture of formic
acid (0.759 g, 0.0165 mol) with sulfuric acid (0.042 g, 2 wt % of
HCOOH + H2O2) was added at 0 °C. After
10 min, the required amount of hydrogen peroxide (1.3503 g, 0.0397
mol) was added dropwise. After addition, the temperature increased
to 55 °C, and the stirring was continued for 5 h. The reaction
temperature was then raised to 90 °C and maintained for 5 h.
The hydroxylated castor oil was extracted with ethyl acetate and washed
with brine solution. Then the combined organic layer was dried over
sodium sulfate. Finally, ethyl acetate was removed from hydroxylated
castor oil under reduced pressure (Scheme 2). The hydroxyl value (OHV) of castor polyol
was calculated by ASTM standard D 4274-94, and the OHV of the castor
polyol was 310 mg KOH/g. It is known from the literature that castor
oil is a triacylglycerol comprising 90% of ricinoleic acid and 10%
of a variety of fatty acids and glycerol.35,36 The ester of ricinoleic acid and glycerol has been reported as the
castor oil structure in Scheme 2 and Figures S7 and S8.

4.7 Preparation of PUF and
PUTFs
In a
beaker, castor polyol was taken along with PTFM (0, 50, and 100 wt
% with respect to castor polyol, and resulted foams were named as
PUF, PUTF-50, and PUTF-100, respectively). The above mixture was heated
at 50 °C for 10 min to get a uniform mixture. The mixture was
cooled to room temperature, and a required amount of dibutyltin dilaurate
(DBTL) (catalyst), TEGOSTAB (surfactant), and water was added. To
the above mixture, the calculated amount of polymeric MDI (corresponding
to NCO/OH 1.2:1 ratio) followed by n-pentane was added and mixed thoroughly with a mechanical stirrer
at 2000 rpm. Then the mixture was poured into molds to get free-rise
foams, and the resulted foams were cured at ambient temperature for
24 h. Recipe for the preparation of PUF and PUTFs is tabulated in Table 5, and free-rise foams
in paper cups are shown in Scheme 3.
