The
epithelial integrin αvβ6 is expressed by many malignant
carcinoma cell types, including pancreatic cancer, and thus represents
a promising target for radionuclide therapy. The peptide cyclo(FRGDLAFp(NMe)K) was decorated with different chelators (DOTPI, DOTAGA,
and DOTA). The Lu(III) complexes of these conjugates exhibited comparable
αvβ6 integrin affinities (IC50 ranging from
0.3 to 0.8 nM) and good selectivities against other integrins (IC50 for αvβ8 >43 nM; for α5β1 >238
nM;
and for αvβ3, αvβ5, and αIIbβ3
>1000 nM). Although different formal charges of the Lu(III) chelates
(ranging from 0 to 4) resulted in strongly varying degrees of hydrophilicity
(log D ranging from −3.0 to −4.1),
biodistributions in murine H2009 xenografts of the Lu-177-labeled
compounds (except the DOTPI derivative) were quite similar and comparable
to our previously reported αvβ6 integrin positron emission
tomography tracer Ga-68-avebehexin. Hence, combinations of existing
Ga-68- and Lu-177-labeled c(FRGDLAFp(NMe)K) derivatives
could be utilized for αvβ6 integrin-targeted theranostics,
whereas our data nonetheless suggest that further improvement of pharmacokinetics
might be necessary to ensure clinical success.

Introduction
Integrins,1 a family of 24 heterodimeric
transmembrane receptors primarily mediating cell adhesion, have been
in the focus of pharmaceutical research for a long time.2 Despite up-regulation of several integrin subtypes
is related to pathological conditions,3 the development of specific inhibitors as well as molecular imaging
agents has been predominantly focused on the subtype αvβ3
for decades because of its long-known key role in (tumor) angiogenesis4,5 However, more recently, other integrins have attracted considerable
interest in view of their involvement in cancer pathogenesis.6 In particular, the subtype αvβ6 is
poorly expressed by normal adult epithelia, but upregulated in a variety
of carcinomas. It is also linked to poor prognosis and furthermore
has been found to promote carcinoma invasion.7,8 Therefore,
the αvβ6 integrin is an attractive target for molecular
imaging and therapy of cancers.

Consequently, a number of radiolabeled
αvβ6 integrin
ligands for in vivo imaging of the αvβ6 integrin expression
have been developed in recent years.9−15 Along these lines, we recently synthesized a small series of positron
emission tomography (PET) imaging agents based on the metabolically
stable and αvβ6 integrin-selective cyclic nonapeptide
cyclo(FRGDLAFp(NMe)K).16 One to three peptide moieties were conjugated to the chelator TRAP
(1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-tris[methylene(2-carboxyethyl)phosphinic
acid])17 and labeled with the positron
emitter 68GaIII (t1/2 = 68 min). Because of its pronounced hydrophilicity promoting rapid
renal clearance, the monomeric peptide conjugate 68Ga-avebehexin18 (see Chart 1) exhibited the most favorable image contrast (tumor-to-blood/muscle
ratio) in μPET scans of subcutaneous murine H2009 (αvβ6
integrin-expressing human lung adenocarcinoma) xenografts. For this
compound, we furthermore noticed a particularly low unspecific uptake
in the pancreas, corresponding to the complete absence of αvβ6
integrin in the normal pancreatic tissue according to immunohistochemistry.
On the other hand, the αvβ6 integrin is overexpressed
by the tumor cells of almost 90% of all pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas
(PDACs)19−21 and thus represents a highly promising target for
theranostics of PDAC. The fact that PDAC is one of the most lethal
cancers with a five-year survival rate of only 8%,22 causing more annual deaths than prostate carcinoma,23 points at an unmet clinical need and the necessity
to develop improved therapies particularly for this malignancy, whereas
a substantial curative value for other cancers frequently expressing
β6 integrin, such as head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma,24 can be anticipated as well.

Chart 1 Chelator conjugates
of the αvβ6 integrin-selective cyclic
nonapeptide cyclo(FRGDLAFp(NMe)K)
However, although TRAP is suitable for elaboration
of 64Cu25 and particularly of 68Ga radiopharmaceuticals26,27 because of
its pronounced
selectivity for small metal cations,28 it
is not applicable for complexation of established therapeutic radionuclides,29 that is, β–- or α-emitting
radiometal ions such as 177LuIII, 90YIII, 213BiIII, or 225AcIII, thus restricting the applicability of avebehexin
to imaging. Hence, we synthesized a second series of conjugates with
chelators for lanthanide-type ions shown in Chart 1, aiming at the corresponding therapeutic
agents required for αvβ6 integrin addressing theranostics.

Results
and Discussion
Because we previously found that conjugation
of biomolecules to
TRAP-type chelators can be done very conveniently by means of CuI-mediated azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) followed
by removal of TRAP-bound copper by competitive demetalation with 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic
acid (NOTA),18,30 we again utilized this approach
to decorate the alkyne-functionalized peptide c(FRGDLAFp(NMe)K(pentynoic acid)) with azide-equipped cyclen-based chelators
DOTPI,31 DOTAGA, and DOTA (Chart 2).

Chart 2 Azide-decorated chelators
for conjugation to alkyne-functionalized
peptides by means of click chemistry (CuAAC)
We found that for all these chelators, transchelation indeed
proceeds
as expected.32 However, in contrast to
Cu–TRAP and Cu–DOTPI complexes, Cu removal from DOTA
and DOTAGA remained incomplete because the slightly higher thermodynamic
stabilities of the respective CuII complexes prevented
a sufficient shift of the equilibrium toward the Cu–NOTA side.
Hence, the complete removal of Cu from the DOTA and DOTAGA conjugates
ultimately afforded the use of sulfide, resulting in fairly low yields
(7 and 18%) which are frequently observed for this method. Because
of this situation and to elucidate the influence of the triazole moiety
in the linkers, the latter two chelators were also conjugated directly
via amide bonding (57 and 65% yield). Furthermore, an analogue of
avebehexin featuring the TRAP-type chelator NOPO33 has been prepared to expand the set of conjugates amenable
to 68Ga labeling for a preliminary, comparative 68Ga-PET study.

The selection of the chelators followed the rationale
to equip
the peptide with radiometal chelate moieties featuring different net
charges, resulting in varying degrees of polarity and, therefore,
distinctly different pharmacokinetics. As we previously observed that 68Ga-avebetrin, which contains a twofold negatively charged 68GaIII chelate, exhibited a lower background uptake
compared to a radiolabeled c(FRGDLAFp(NMe)K)-NODAGA
conjugate featuring an uncharged 68GaIII chelate,18 we expected that a similar beneficial effect
of negatively charged chelates might be observed for the therapeutic 177LuIII complexes. Table 1 shows that indeed, the charge has the most
pronounced influence on polarity (expressed as octanol–water
distribution coefficients, log D, at pH 7.4), whereas
the effect of the triazole is less substantial. A similar, systematic
pattern is however not observed for the 68GaIII complexes, presumably owing to the fact that the respective hexacoordinate
chelates are zwitterionic34 and the formal
charge is less well-correlated to the actual number of charged atoms
contained.

Notably, we observed that for c(avb6)-Trz-DOTA, the triazole linker
actually affected radiolabeling, not only with 68Ga but
also with 177Lu. Whereas the labeling of all other compounds
under standard conditions (see Experimental Section) proceeded as expected and typically resulted in products with >98%
purity according to radio-thin-layer chromatography (TLC), the triazole-DOTA
precursor showed markedly inferior labeling yields and reduced radiochemical
purity (90% and less). We hypothesize that close proximity of the
additional triazole nitrogen donor thwarts the formation of the thermodynamically
stable, kinetically inert “in-cage” chelate by stabilizing
the initially formed, kinetically labile “out-of-cage”
encounter complex.35 Hence, the usage of
the CuAAC-conjugated DOTA-monoamide building block cannot be recommended
for radiometalated compounds, at least not in the particular structural
setup with a C3 alkyl chain between the chelator and azide/triazole
functions.

Table 2 shows that
the nature and the charge of the chelate have no substantial influence
on the αvβ6 integrin affinities (expressed as 50% inhibition
concentrations, IC50). Values in the similar sub-nanomolar
range are invariantly observed for LuIII as well as for
the GaIII complexes. The same applies to selectivities;
despite somewhat larger variations, affinities to other integrins
are low enough to rule out a significant degree of binding in an in
vivo setting. An exception is observed for the NOPO conjugate, although
an IC50 of approx. 2 nM is still to be considered absolutely
sufficient for imaging.

Figure 1 shows that
the results of ex vivo biodistribution studies of the 177Lu-labeled compounds in H2009 (αvβ6 integrin positive
human lung adenocarcinoma) xenografted severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID) mice are remarkably similar, except for the heavily charged
DOTPI derivative which showed markedly higher activity in the kidneys
and strongly reduced organ/tissue uptakes. For the other compounds,
tumor uptakes are also comparably low, which is however rooted in
a fairly low αvβ6 integrin expression density of the tumor
model (approx. 25% positive tumor cells in the solid tumor mass).18 Likewise, the substantial uptakes in several
organs (lung, stomach, and intestines) are resulting from a low-level
αvβ6 integrin expression in the respective murine organs
and have been proven to be specific (i.e., fully blockable) in the
context of preclinical evaluation of 68Ga-avebehexin.18

Figure 1 Tumor-to-organ/tissue ratios (top) and biodistribution

% injected dose per gram tissue) of approx. 2 MBq of the 177Lu-labeled c(avb6)-peptide conjugates in H2009 xenografted SCID mice,
90 min p.i. (mean ± SD, n = 3–5; for
data in the numerical form, see Tables S1 and S2.). Literature data for 68Ga-avebehexin18 are plotted as a reference.

Because of similar biodistributions,
none of the investigated compounds
clearly stands out in terms of tumor-to-organ ratios, although the
two DOTAGA derivatives appear to be somewhat favored. The actual extent
is however low, and it remains questionable whether these results
in murine models would translate to the human setting. Data for natLu-c(avb6)-Trz-DOTA are reported for the sake of completeness
but should be considered less relevant because of the above-mentioned
irregularities in terms of radiolabeling.

Although not being
the primary focus of this study, we also performed
a preliminary comparison of PET imaging properties of the corresponding 68Ga-labeled compounds. Figure 2 shows that the image contrast is quite similar for
all tracers, however slightly favoring our previous lead candidate 68Ga-avebehexin18 which features
a particularly low background uptake. As an exception, 68Ga-c(avb6)-Trz-DOTA shows high blood pool activity (indicated by
hotspots in the regions of heart and carotid), which is most likely
caused by radiometal dissociation, consistent with our hypothesis
that this chelate is actually present as a kinetically labile “out-of-cage”
complex (see above). Furthermore, substantial variations of absolute
tumor uptakes are observed in contrast to the 177Lu-labeled
species, which however cannot be fully explained on the basis of our
limited data set.

c(avb6)-peptide conjugates in H2009 tumor-bearing SCID mice (approx.
12 MBq, 60 min p.i.). Images are scaled for similar visual intensity
in the tumor (positions indicated by white arrows), resulting in different
upper limits (% injected dose per milliliter) of scale bars.

Discussion
As inferred from previous
studies,16,18 cyclo(FRGDLAFp(NMe)K) was
found to tolerate a variety of functionalizations
without substantial impact on the integrin affinity profile. Contrary
to our expectations, however, the fourfold negatively charged 177Lu-DOTPI derivative actually showed inferior in vivo properties,
namely, a comparatively low uptake in tumor and αvβ6 integrin
expressing organs but a much higher activity accumulation in the kidneys.
The first observation is explained by the fact that an increased polarity
accelerates blood clearance and owing to fewer tissue passages, reduces
target accumulation of a tracer. However, it is surprising that the
presence of several negative charges multiplies kidney retention because
one would expect a more rapid and complete excretion instead. Presumably,
the specific configuration of the monoconjugated DOTPI complex is
subjected to a specific reabsorption mechanism. Irrespective of different
chelators and formal charges of radiometal chelates (0 and −1),
biodistribution of the other 177Lu-labeled species is remarkably
similar and furthermore matches the in vivo properties of the PET
imaging agent 68Ga-avebehexin. Hence, combinations of these 68Ga and 177Lu radiopharmaceuticals are, by principle,
applicable as αvβ6 integrin-targeted theranostic pairs.

However, in contrast to the imaging agents which should primarily
exhibit a high target-to-background ratio to ensure a good image contrast,
clinical applicability of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals ultimately
depends on the delivered radiation dose per tissue volume, which should
be as high as possible. In this context, we consider it problematic
that the tumor uptake of the 177Lu-labeled c(FRGDLAFp(NMe)K) derivatives is low and by far does not match the
usual values known from clinically successful radiopeptides and theranostics,
such as sst2 ligands or prostate-specific membrane antigen inhibitors.
In principle, this does not implicate a general unsuitability for
therapeutic purposes, particularly in view of the above-mentioned,
comparatively low target expression density in the subcutaneous tumor
models, which might not truly reflect the clinical situation.

We nevertheless hold the opinion that even our preliminary data
set clearly indicates a yet unsatisfactory performance and a lot of
room for improvement, suggesting that the properties of these simple
peptide–chelate conjugates do not warrant clinical transfer.
This applies even more because past experience has shown that the
premature clinical transfer of nonoptimal compounds sometimes hampered
or even inhibited subsequent clinical implementation of more advanced
agents, ultimately compromising patient welfare. A plethora of strategies
for the optimization of pharmacokinetics and tuning of in vivo properties
have been developed over the decades, for example, the introduction
of pharmacokinetic modifiers into the molecular frameworks. In the
present case, such approaches should be systematically exploited to
obtain compounds with more adequate properties before taking the next
steps.

Against this background, we also decided to refrain from
a more
extended in vivo evaluation of the 177Lu labeled and particularly
of the 68Ga-PET agents. Despite the low animal numbers
and the absence of control experiments limit the significance of our
study and may render it methodically weak, it appears to be the most
appropriate decision with respect to the 3R-rule (reduce, refine,
and replace). In the context of an increasingly critical public opinion
towards animal experiments and a growing societal awareness for animal
welfare, the number of animals necessary for a given experiment should
probably not be characterized by strict adherence to statistics. In
view of the logical proposition that a theory cannot be proven by
any finite data set but be refuted by a single experiment, even a
small trial may already supply enough information to experienced researchers
to enable them to predict a long-term failure and to adjust a study
plan accordingly. We nonetheless believe that examples of such data
(e.g., Figure 2) deserve
to be disseminated to help others to avoid the same pitfall, ultimately
resulting in a more responsible use of resources and animals.

Conclusions
In summary, the αvβ6 integrin-selective peptide cyclo(FRGDLAFp(NMe)K) can be equipped with different chelators and subsequently
labeled with the therapeutic radionuclide 177Lu, without
substantial loss of target affinity and selectivity. Notwithstanding
this, the in vivo properties of the resulting therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals
are essentially not satisfactory, particularly in terms of absolute
tumor uptake, not warranting immediate clinical translation. Further
modification of the structures, aiming at the optimization of tumor
uptake and retention, is required before the potential of c(FRGDLAFp(NMe)K)-based αvβ6 integrin-targeted radiopharmaceuticals
that can be harnessed for cancer therapy in a clinical setting.

Experimental
Section
General
Unless otherwise noted, all commercially available
reagents and solvents were of analytical grade and were used without
further purification. 3-Azido-1-propylamine, Cu(OAc)2·H2O, 4-pentynoic acid, diisopropylamine (DIPEA), and sodium
ascorbate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany).
NOTA was purchased from Macrocyclics, Inc. (Plano, Texas, USA). DOTA-tris(tBu)ester and DOTAGA anhydride were obtained
from CheMatech (Dijon, France). HATU was obtained from Bachem Holding
AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). The chlorotrityl chloride resin was purchased
from Iris Biotech GmbH (Marktredwitz, Germany). N-terminal Fmoc-protected
amino acids were purchased from Iris Biotech GmbH, Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe,
Germany) and Carbolution Chemicals GmbH (St. Ingbert, Germany). The
Solid-phase peptide synthesis was performed in 20 mL syringes by B.
Braun (Melsungen, Germany) equipped with an additional frit. NOPO,36 DOTPI,37 as well
as cyclo(F-R-G-D-L-A-F-p-(NMe)K(pentynoic acid)),
TRAP(azide)1, and avebehexin18 were synthesized as described previously.

Analytical and preparative
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were performed on Shimadzu
gradient systems, each equipped with a SPD-20A dual wavelength UV–vis
detector (λ1 = 220 nm, λ2 = 254
nm). For analytical purposes, a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with a Nucleosil
100-5 C18 column (125 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size) was
used for linear gradients in 15 or 20 min. A mixture of acetonitrile
(J.T.Baker Ultra Gradient HPLC grade, supplemented with 5% H2O) and purified water (from Millipore system) was used as an eluent,
containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); gradient A: 15–65% MeCN in 15 min, gradient B: 0–40%
MeCN in 20 min. Preparative HPLC purification was performed with a
Multospher 100 RP 18-5μ column (250 × 10 mm, 5 μm
particle size) at a flow rate of 5.0 mL/min in 15 min or with a Multospher
100 RP 18-5μ column (150 × 10 mm, 5 μm particle size)
at a flow rate of 3.0 mL/min in 20 min. Mass spectra were acquired
on an expressionL CMS mass spectrometer with electrospray
ionization and a quadrupole analyzer (Advion Inc. Ithaca, USA). NMR
spectra were measured on an AVHD 300 (Bruker, Billerica, USA) device
at 300 K. Determination of pH values was done using a calibrated SevenEasy
pH meter from Mettler Toledo (Gießen, Germany). For lyophilization,
an Alpha 1-2 lyophilization apparatus (Christ, Osterode, Germany)
with a rotary vane pump RZ-2 (Vacuubrand, Wertheim, Germany) was used.
Centrifugation was done using a Heraeus Megafuge 16R centrifuge (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA). Quantification of tissue activities
was done using a 2480 WIZARD2 automatic γ-counter (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, USA).

Integrin Binding Assays
IC50 values were
determined as described previously,37,38 using the
following compounds as internal standards: cilengitide39 (αvß3—0.54
nM, αvß5—8 nM, and α5ß1—15.4 nM), the linear RTD-peptide
RTDLDSLRT40 (αvß6—33 nM and αvß8—100
nM), and tirofiban41 (αIIbß3—1.2 nM). Briefly, the flat-bottom 96-well
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (BRAND,
Wertheim, Germany) were coated with the respective extracellular matrix
protein in a carbonate buffer (15 mM Na2CO3,
35 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6) at 4 °C overnight. After washing
the plates with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-T-buffer (PBS/Tween-20),
free binding sites were blocked by incubation with TS-B-buffer (Tris-saline/bovine
serum albumin). Dilution series of the respective inactive LuIII and GaIII compounds (20 μM to 6.4 nM)
were prepared and incubated in 1:1 mixtures with the respective integrin.
Surface-bound integrin was detected by subsequent incubation with
a specific primary antibody and a secondary peroxidase-labeled antibody
(antimouse IgG-POD, Sigma-Aldrich). After the addition of the dye
SeramunBlau (Seramun Diagnostic, Heidesee, Germany) and quenching
of the reaction by the addition of 3 M H2SO4, the absorbance at λ = 405 nm was measured with a microplate
reader (Genius, Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). The IC50 value for each compound was determined in duplicate, and
the inhibition curves were analyzed using OriginPro 9.0 software.
All determined IC50 values were referenced to the activity
of the respective internal standards.

Metal Complexation and
Radiochemistry
For the synthesis
of the nonradioactive GaIII and LuIII complexes,
50 μL of 4 mM aq solution of Ga(NO3)3 or
LuCl3 were added to 100 μL of 2 mM aq solution of
the respective chelator conjugate. The reaction mixture was stirred
at room temperature (rt) (GaIII, 5 min) or 90 °C (LuIII) for 5 min (DOTPI) or 30 min (DOTAGA and DOTA conjugates).
The purity of all synthesized chelates was determined by analytical
reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC and mass spectrometry (MS) and was always
≥95%.

Radiometal incorporation and radiochemical purity
of labeled compounds was determined by radio-TLC on the instant TLC
silica-impregnated chromatography paper (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA;
eluents: 0.1 M trisodium citrate or a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 1 M ammonium
acetate and methanol) and analyzed using a scan-RAM radio-TLC detector
by LabLogic systems Inc. (Brandon, USA). 177Lu-labeling
experiments were performed by mixing a 1 mM solution of the precursor
(0.5–4 nmol) and 10 μL of an aqueous NH4OAc
solution (1 M) to adjust pH to 5.9. Subsequently, 10–24 MBq
of [177Lu]LuCl3 (0.8 GBq/mL, 0.04 M HCl(aq), as obtained from ITG, Garching, Germany)
was added, and the solution was diluted with tracepure water to attain
a final volume of 100 μL. The mixture was heated for 30 min
at 95 °C. The labeling efficiency was determined by radio-TLC
and was always ≥99%. 68Ga-labeling experiments were
performed using a fully-automated on-site system (GallElut+ by Scintomics, Lindach, Germany) as described previously.42 Briefly, the eluate of a 68Ge/68Ga generator with a SnO2 matrix (by IThemba LABS,
SA; 1.25 mL, eluent: 1 M aq. HCl, containing approx. 500 MBq 68Ga) was adjusted to pH 2 by the addition of aq. N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) buffer (450 μL, 2.7 M) and applied for labeling
of 2 nmol of the NOPO or TRAP conjugate, respectively, for 2 min at
95 °C. In the case of the DOTA and DOTAGA compounds, the generator
eluate was adjusted to pH 3 by the addition of aq. HEPES buffer (900
μL, 2.7 M) and applied for labeling of 5 nmol of the respective
ligand for 5 min at 100 °C. The radiolabeled peptides were trapped
on Sep-Pak C8 light solid-phase extraction cartridges, which were
purged with water (10 mL). The product was eluted with 2 mL of aq.
EtOH (50%). After evaporation of the ethanol, the labeling efficiency
was determined by radio-TLC and was always found to be ≥96%,
except for 68Ga-c(avb6)-Trz-DOTA (<90%).

Radio-HPLC
of the 177Lu-labeled compounds was performed
on a Nucleosil 100-5 C18 column (125 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle
size). A mixture of acetonitrile (J. T. Baker Ultra Gradient HPLC
grade, supplemented with 5% H2O) and purified water (from
Millipore system) was used as an eluent, containing 0.1% TFA. For
linear gradients in 15 min, a Sykam S2100 HPLC gradient system (Sykam
GmbH, Eresing, Germany) was utilized with a linear UV–vis detector
(λ = 220 nm) by Linear Instruments Corp. (Reno, USA) and by
an ACE Mate 925-SCINT scintillation counter with a multichannel analyzer
by EG&G Ortec Inc. (Oak Ridge, USA). Radiochemical purity was
always ≥98%.

Determination of log D Values
For
the determination of n-octanol-PBS distribution coefficients
(log D7.4), 500 μL of 1-octanol
and 500 μL of PBS were combined in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.

of the 68Ga-labeled compound was added and vortexed vigorously
for 3 min. The samples were centrifuged (9.000 rpm, 5 min), and the
activities in 200 μL of the organic phase and 20 μL of
the aqueous phase were quantified in a γ-counter. Each experiment
was repeated eight times.

Animal Studies
All animal studies
have been performed
in accordance with general animal welfare regulations in Germany and
the institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals. To establish
xenograft models, three- to four-month-old female CB17 SCID mice (Charles
River, Sulzfeld, Germany) were injected subcutaneously with 0.8 ×
106 H2009 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC CRL-5911;
American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) in Matrigel (CultrexBME,
Type 3 PathClear, Trevigen, GENTAUR GmbH, Aachen, Germany). Mice were
used for biodistribution and PET studies, when tumors had grown to
a diameter of 4–9 mm (8–30 d after inoculation).

PET Imaging
H2009 tumor-bearing SCID mice were anesthesized
with isoflurane for intravenous administration of the 68Ga-labeled compound. The administered activity per mouse ranged between
11 and 16 MBq (50–340 pmol, depending on variations in timing
of production and administration). PET imaging was performed on a
Siemens Inveon small-animal PET system, 60 min p.i. with an acquisition
time of 20 min. Data were reconstructed using Siemens Inveon Research
Workspace software, employing a three-dimensional ordered subset expectation
maximum algorithm without scatter and attenuation correction.

Biodistribution
For biodistribution studies, 0.8–2.2
MBq (approx. 100–350 pmol) of the 177Lu-labeled
compounds was injected into the tail vein of H2009 tumor-bearing SCID
mice. The mice were sacrificed 90 min after injection, a blood sample
was taken, and the organs of interest [heart, lung, liver, spleen,
pancreas, stomach (empty), small intestine (empty), large intestine
(empty), kidneys, adrenals, muscle, eye, tumor, and tail] were dissected.
Quantification of the activity in weighted tissue samples was done
using a γ-counter. Injected dose per gram tissue (% ID/g) was
calculated from the organ weights and counted activities.
