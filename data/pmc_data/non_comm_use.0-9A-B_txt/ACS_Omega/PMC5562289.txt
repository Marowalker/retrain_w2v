Homogeneous
monolayer epitaxial graphene (EG) is an ideal candidate
for the development of millimeter-sized devices with single-crystal
domains. A clean fabrication process was used to produce EG-based
devices, with n-type doping level of the order of 1012 cm–2. Generally, electrical properties of EG, such as
longitudinal resistivity, remain unstable when devices are exposed
to air due to adsorption of molecular dopants, whose presence shifts
the carrier density close to the Dirac point (<1010 cm–2) or into the p-type regime. Here, we report experimental
results on the use of amorphous boron nitride (a-BN) as an encapsulation
layer, whereby EG can maintain its longitudinal resistivity and have
its carrier density modulated. Furthermore, we exposed 12 devices
to controlled temperatures of up to 85 °C and relative humidity
of up to 85% and reported that an approximately 20 nm a-BN encapsulation
thickness is sufficient to preserve their longitudinal resistivity
to within 10% of the previously measured value. We monitored the electronic
properties of our encapsulated and nonencapsulated EG samples by magnetotransport
measurements, using a neodymium iron boron magnet. Our results have
essential importance in the mass production of millimeter-scale graphene
devices, with stable electrical properties.

1 Introduction
Graphene
has been given significant attention over the recent years,
in part for its desirable set of electrical properties.1−3 It has been shown that graphene grown on silicon carbide (SiC) displays
properties most useful for the development of millimeter-sized, single-domain
devices, particularly in the field of metrology.4−11 Experiments performed on millimeter-scale devices indicate that
epitaxially grown graphene (EG) can provide uniform transport properties
over large areas, a prospect most promising when it comes to development
of much larger graphene-based devices.12 Although properties of EG such as the longitudinal resistivity,
carrier density, and mobility are generally good figures of merit
to determine epitaxial graphene quality,13 these properties are desired to be controllable if such devices
are to be mass produced.

When stored in air, the longitudinal
resistivity of unprotected
EG changes unpredictably with time,14−17 so it becomes necessary, specifically
for electronic applications, to find an appropriate encapsulating
material to both preserve the longitudinal resistivity of EG devices
and to enable possible carrier-density control of the devices. The
various studies addressing some of the effects of encapsulation on
epitaxial graphene only address the effects from polymers and oxides.18−22 Millimeter-scale encapsulation with boron nitride has not been explored
mainly because with commonly used techniques involving mechanically
exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride flakes, flake sizes do not typically
exceed a few hundred micrometers, which does not satisfy the requirement
of millimeter-sized coverage. Contrary to mechanical exfoliation,
the technique of encapsulation with amorphous boron nitride (a-BN)
by pulsed laser deposition23−25 can be used for millimeter-sized
areas of EG and is performed at temperatures around 200 °C. Here,
we will report on the effectiveness of a-BN as an encapsulation material
on EG on the basis of transport measurements.

EG is grown on
square SiC chips diced from 76 mm 4H-SiC(0001) semi-insulating
wafers (CREEa) of miscut similar to that in
previous studies.12 Samples are prepared
with a hydrofluoric acid rinse and cleaned with deionized water. They
are then oriented such that the silicon face makes close contact to
the polished pyrolytic graphite substrate (SPI Glas 22a), wherein the closeness is defined by the observation of
Newton’s rings. Epitaxial growth is then performed using a
graphite-lined resistive-element furnace (Materials Research Furnaces
Inc.a), with heating and cooling rates of approximately
1.5 °C/s. The processing begins with a substrate cleaning at
1050 °C in a forming-gas environment (96% Ar, 4% H2) at 100 kPa for 30 min. The forming-gas cleaning serves to hydrogenate
the surface of the SiC chips.26,27 Processing continues
with a chamber flush with Ar gas and filling with 100 kPa Ar from
a 99.999% liquid Ar source before annealing at 1900 °C.

Once EG is grown, the chips are placed in a home-built vacuum chamber,
which is pumped down to at least 10–6 Pa. Encapsulation
of the EG with a-BN occurs via low-temperature pulsed laser deposition.
The growth of the stoichiometric a-BN thin films has been extensively
described in previous manuscripts23,25 and allows
for a thin film of insulating, high-quality boron nitride to be deposited
on a multitude of substrates, including graphene. The process involves
the use of a KrF laser to ablate a high-purity amorphous BN target
in 6.66 Pa of ultrahigh-pressure nitrogen gas. The stoichiometric
formation of the films is made possible by the gas phase reactions
occurring between the ablated plasma and nitrogen background gas at
that pressure, delivering the precursor gases to the substrate at
precisely the right concentration and energies.28 The thickness of the BN film is controlled by the number
of laser pulses striking the target, with a growth rate of approximately
1 nm BN growth per 10 pulses. The substrate stage during growth was
heated to 200 °C, and upon completion of the a-BN deposition,
the samples were allowed to cool to room temperature before removal
of the EG/a-BN material stack. All encapsulations had thicknesses
of approximately 20 nm. Device fabrication follows a similar procedure
as in the previous work.14 A detailed description
of the fabrication procedure can be found in the Supporting Information.

All EG samples (and later, completed
devices) were characterized
by optical microscopy before and after deposition and after the experiment.
Images were taken with a Nikon MM400a optical
microscope and filtered to show high contrast at the SiC(0001) terrace
boundaries, which form naturally during growth. On the basis of Figure 1c, the additional
20 nm of a-BN does not appear to significantly alter the quality of
the images. Shortly, after graphene growth, atomic force microscopy
(AFM) is used to determine the general coverage of EG. An Asylum Cyphera was used to gather AFM images in tapping mode, one
of which can be seen in Figure 1d. In addition to the topography of EG, phase images are also
acquired. Topographic and phase images were acquired with a scan rate
of 1 Hz and have a scan size of 15 × 5 μm2.

Figure 1 (a) An
illustration of a Hall bar and the location at which optical
and AFM images are taken. (b) Optical image, taken at 100× magnification,
of an unprotected EG device (labeled S2D1) prior to the start of the
experiment. (c) Optical image, taken at 100× magnification, of
an encapsulated EG device (labeled S3D2) prior to the start of the
experiment. Within the dotted green region shown, (d) an AFM topographic
image is acquired. (e) A phase image is also acquired to verify the
coverage. (f) From the AFM topography, a line profile is shown to
demonstrate the general sloped flatness of the terraces.

Raman spectra were recorded before deposition,
after deposition,
and at the end of the experiment, using a continuous-wave laser excitation
at 514.5 nm, with a commercial Renishaw InVia Ramana microscope. The purpose of the Raman spectra was to verify
that the deposition of BN did not either destroy or completely deteriorate
the EG quality. Each spectrum for the five samples shown in Figure 2 is the average of
a spectral map that was acquired to ensure reproducibility. The maps
were collected at roughly the same location shown in Figure 1a, with 20 μm steps,
forming a 5 by 3 raster-style grid. There is no significant change
in the D modes for the three chips encapsulated with 20 nm a-BN. Although
the positions of the 2D (G′) mode mostly remained within a
few wavenumbers (2725 cm–1) during the experiment,
the deposition of a-BN appears to slightly shift the mode down by
approximately 20 cm–1 for samples three and five,
which indicates a slight increase in the electron density and an introduction
of strain on the single crystal.29,30 The width
of this mode for S5 is the only parameter that changes by more than
a few wavenumbers (≈30 cm–1). Tables for
values of the Raman positions and widths are provided in the Supporting Information. In the case of S4, the
growth of graphene was much lower compared to that of S3 and S5. Therefore,
one can expect that the susceptibility of S4 to Raman shifts is minimal
due to the lower total surface area (more will be discussed on the
impact of lower EG coverage).

Figure 2 Raman spectra are shown for each of the five
samples taken before
(black curve) and after (red curve) the experiment, and in some cases,
the Raman spectra are shown for the samples prior to a-BN deposition
(blue curve). Curves are smoothed with an adjacent average of five
points. The SiC background around the 2D (G′) mode is low,
removing the need for subtraction. The inset shows the Raman spectral
range around the D band of graphene. The inset curves have been subtracted
with a background SiC Raman spectrum, taken with the same measuring
parameters, to enhance clarity of the D mode seen at approximately
1365 cm–1. Each curve is the average of a Raman-map
acquisition consisting of 15 curves. The shifts for S2, S3, and S5
are shown as gray vertical lines.

Although data from the spectral range shown in the main part
of Figure 2 had a low
background,
data from the spectral range of the G band is overwhelmed by the Raman
response of the silicon carbide substrate. And on the other hand,
the D band can be more easily extracted if the SiC background is subtracted,
given that the background is not as strong in the spectral range neighboring
the D band. When the SiC background is subtracted from each of the
samples, one would expect either a flat spectrum or the D band at
approximately 1350 cm–1. However, our Raman data
show a broad peak, about 50 cm–1 in width, at the
average peak position of 1364.6 ± 3.3 cm–1.
This data is shown as an inset to Figure 2. It is likely that this is a shifted D band29,31 because Raman data collected from an unprotected sample shows this
peak, whereas data for a blank SiC chip deposited with a-BN lacks
this peak.

2 Results and Discussion
Once devices
are fully fabricated and have their Raman spectra
measured, they are prepared for magnetotransport measurements at room
temperature. The setup is a four-point probe station, with an adjustable
magnetic stage and a built-in microscope. With the addition of a Teflon
block and neodymium iron boron (NIB) magnet, we can produce room temperature
magnetic fields of up to ±240 ± 2 mT (see Figure 3 for setup). Measurements and
mapping of the B-field for this magnet were performed
with a Lakeshore Gauss metera and are provided
in the Supporting Information. The Hall
voltage (Rxy) is measured
by aligning the device to the same marked spot on the NIB magnet,
and using Labviewa to run a script that collects I–V curves from the probes and multimeter,
with a maximum current of 1 and 0.05 μA increments. By measuring Rxy multiple times at each of
the several magnetic-field points, one can extract the carrier density
using 1  Here, e is the
electron charge
and the derivative is replaced by a slope, ΔRxy/ΔB, taken from
the best-fit line of all of the Rxy voltages measured with a varying B-field.
The longitudinal resistance, which we seek to stabilize and is marked Rxx, is measured in a similar electrical fashion,
with probes being moved to new spots on the contacts. Each value is
measured at least three times and averaged. Unlike Rxy, measurements at zero B-field are enough to determine the longitudinal resistivity, ρxx. One divides Rxx by a length-to-width ratio that reflects the size and configuration
of the Hall bar. In all cases for this experiment, the value of the
length-to-width ratio is 2. Additionally, to obtain the mobility of
the device, one uses the following equation, which requires both the
carrier density and longitudinal resistivity (note that the resistivity
can be replaced by resistance, width W, and length L of Hall bar) 2  These measurements are
repeated for each of
the 12 devices after various forms of environmental exposure. After
a device is first measured electrically, we expose it to a series
of varied environmental conditions, which include changes in both
temperature and relative humidity. We use a Thermotrona testing chamber to expose samples. For temperatures and relative
humidities, the chamber can maintain a particular parameter within
0.1% of the desired value, and so the used values are listed in Table 1.

NIB magnet separated from the magnetic
stage by a Teflon block in a four-point probe station. The NIB magnet
is used to induce a strong-enough magnetic field for room-temperature
measurements of the Hall voltage. The north and south maxima are measured
to be ±240 ± 2 mT.

When the carrier densities are measured, as shown
in Figure 4, a comparison
is made between
the two types of device, those that are unprotected (S1 and S2) and
those that are encapsulated with a-BN (S3, S4, and S5). Graphs with
no breaks are provided in the Supporting Information. What becomes evident in the case of the unprotected EG is that
although changes do occur with exposure to various environmental conditions,
the changes are generally less than half of an order of magnitude.
In the case of the a-BN-encapsulated devices, carrier densities can
be tuned such that they reach and exceed an order of magnitude, depending
on the device. However, in more ambient conditions, such as longer
time frames of 62–158 h and 201–321 h, the effects of
environmental conditioning allow for repeated tuning of the carrier
density. The changes in the carrier density can be attributed to the
adsorption of water molecules on the edges of the device. Furthermore,
water molecules can find their way into the EG/a-BN interface from
the edges due to the hydrophilic buffer layer between EG and SiC.32 The ability of the a-BN encapsulation to assist
in gateless modulation of the carrier density by use of extreme weathering
is realized. Further studies with more varying parameters, such as
thicker a-BN films, colder temperatures, and many additional devices
are required to make a more definitive statement regarding the precision
to which the carrier density can be modulated without a gate.

Figure 4 A semilogarithmic
plot of the carrier density of 12 devices as
a function of time is shown, with identical vertical scales. The top
half of the graph shows the six unprotected EG devices as dashed curves,
whereas the bottom half shows the six encapsulated devices as solid
curves. Note that for the solid green curve (S3D1), the carrier density
represents a hole density, as that device exhibited heavy p-doping
after the fabrication process. The uncertainty of each point is smaller
than the corresponding symbol used to indicate the value.

Measurements of the longitudinal resistivity show
that the a-BN
encapsulation successfully preserves the value to within 10% of the
previously measured value, regardless of the type of environmental
exposure performed here. Figure 5 showing longitudinal or surface resistivity is graphed
in a similar way, and Table 2 gives the initial values for the longitudinal resistivity,
ρxx. This stable behavior is expected
because the number of potential contaminants that could bind to the
EG surface is no longer able to bind due to the presence of a-BN.
It is worth noting that a pair of devices on a fourth chip were fabricated
after the deposition of 10 nm of a-BN, but these devices failed to
show stability and resembled the changes experienced by the unprotected
devices. For more information, please see the Supporting Information.

Figure 5 Graphs are shown for measurements of the
percent change of longitudinal
resistivity (ρxx) as a function
of time. The six unprotected and six encapsulated EG devices are represented
in the top half (dashed curves) and bottom half (solid curves) of
this graph, respectively. The greatly improved stability of ρxx is demonstrated after each environmental exposure.
The uncertainty of each point is smaller than the corresponding symbol
used to indicate the value, and the vertical scales are identical
to accentuate the improvements achieved with encapsulation.

In the
top half of Figure 5, we observe a large change in the longitudinal resistivity,
ρxx in the unprotected EG devices.
The values are shown as percentage changes from the previously measured
values of ρxx. The sharpest drop
in ρxx occurs when devices are exposed
to 85 °C and 85% relative humidity conditions for 23 h. Two of
the unprotected devices were introduced slightly later into the experiment
(at 62 h) to give us more statistics on general unprotected device
behavior. The devices coated with a-BN, made from samples S3, S4,
and S5, are in the bottom half of Figure 5. Unlike their unprotected counterparts,
the encapsulated devices show a strong resistance to change when exposed
to the same conditions, a feature that can be seen more clearly because
the vertical scales of Figure 5 are identical for the top and bottom halves.

Five of
the six devices did not deviate from this trend of sustained
preservation of ρxx. The sixth,
however, demonstrated a strange behavior at the start of the experiment.
During 0–21 h, with an exposure to 85 °C and 0% relative
humidity, S3D2 developed bubbles on the surface, which seemed to be
trapped by the thin film of a-BN (see Supporting Information for images and more details). With the formation
of bubbles on the Hall bar, the corresponding drop of resistivity
was from 1054.8 ± 4.9 to 752.8 ± 4.0 Ω. As the experiment
progressed, continued formation did not occur, and the device remained
within the 10% change-per-condition range. For this reason, the initial
point was omitted and the curve renormalized but can be seen in its
full form in the Supporting Information. The bubble formation decoupled a-BN from the EG surface and prevented
any interfacial interactions, thus changing the resistivity for this
initial measurement. Given that unprotected devices can change up
to 35% of their previously held value, it is shown that approximately
20 nm of deposited a-BN is sufficient to encapsulate EG to preserve
its longitudinal resistivity. Additionally, and to compare our results
to another type of encapsulation, Parylene C is used to coat the two
devices. In the case of the pinhole-free polymer, a film thickness
greater than 500 nm was required to improve stabilization of the longitudinal
resistivity. Another advantage a-BN has as an encapsulation material
over other polymers, such as Parylene C, is that due to the thinner
layer needed to achieve encapsulation, it could be applied to more
devices in which top gates are implemented. More details on these
measurements are presented in the Supporting Information.

By combining the data for ρxx and carrier density, the mobility of each device can be monitored
for each set of measurements performed. The resulting curves are shown
in Figure 6 and follow
similar trends to the carrier density. Although ρxx does not change very much, as described earlier,
we cannot expect the same from the mobility because it is mathematically
dependent on the carrier density, which has been shown to be tunable
with environmental conditioning. One also notices that the mobility
is lower for some of the EG chips. Because of a poor miscut of the
underlying SiC substrate, two of the encapsulated chips had a visibly
lower yield of growth on the surface. Three encapsulated EG chips
are shown in Figure 7, with optical images that were filtered to enhance the contrast
between a single layer of EG and the substrate. Such stunted growth
can easily lead to lower mobility and increased initial surface resistivity,
as measured and shown in Table 2 of the main text. S4 has the highest longitudinal resistivity
(by about an order of magnitude) compared to that of other samples.

Figure 6 Carrier
mobility for all 12 devices is represented here, with the
long-dash dotted lines as the unprotected devices (top half) and the
solid lines as the encapsulated devices (bottom half). The mobility
at each point is calculated using the formula shown in the main text,
using the data acquired for the electron density and longitudinal
resistivity. The uncertainty of each point is smaller than the corresponding
symbol used to indicate the value. The horizontal scale is kept fully
intact for clarity.

Figure 7 Sample regions are shown
for an example device on each of the three
EG chips which were deposited with a-BN. The three chips had different
conditions of EG growth and the overall coverage varied from chip
to chip. (a) The general coverage of EG on S4 was partially compared
to that on S5 and S3. The inset is a zoom-in of a region of EG that,
due to insufficient growth time, grew as nanoribbons that branch out
and slowly converge into a uniform single crystal of graphene. (b)
The same phenomenon is seen on S5 (as shown with a blue dotted line),
but the growth shows significantly more coverage over the chip. (c)
S3 shows no indication of the incomplete EG growth. On the contrary,
the bright, vertical, edgelike features on the right half of the image
are bilayers beginning to form along SiC terraces.

In Figure 7, images
are acquired, for example, on the devices on S3, S4, and S5 at the
left drain contact, with the orange dotted line indicating the region
just outside the boundary, wherein the EG edge and evidence of etched-away
graphene is clearly noticeable. The matching contrast outside the
Hall bar to the regions within the Hall bar show the SiC substrate.
A closeup is provided in Figure 7a to show the stunted growth of the graphene on S4
and, by extension, on S5.

To show the extent of potentially
controllable, gateless modulation, Figure 8 presents mobility
as a function of carrier density for each device. Apart from a single
data point, most curves for the unprotected EG devices remain relatively
confined to the neighborhood of the inherent value of the carrier
density and mobility. By having eventual control over the amount of
carrier modulation, every device can be optimized to user-desired
values regardless of the inherent value.

Figure 8 Graph plots the logarithm
of mobility against logarithm of carrier
density. Generally, the unprotected EG devices, represented by dashed
lines and triangular data points, are confined to a smaller region
of tunable mobility and carrier density, as opposed to the encapsulated
devices, represented by dotted lines and circular data points. An
inset is included to zoom in on the local parameter space behavior
of three of the devices. S3D1 is excluded because of its p-doped behavior.
The uncertainty of each point is smaller than the corresponding symbol
used to indicate the value.

3 Conclusions
We performed experiments to determine
whether the use of a-BN as
an encapsulation layer is sufficient to preserve the longitudinal
resistivity of EG. Post deposition, we exposed six encapsulated devices
and six unprotected devices to controlled temperatures of up to 85
°C and relative humidity of up to 85%. Overall, a-BN encapsulation
thickness of approximately 20 nm is sufficient to preserve the longitudinal
resistivity within 10% of its last-measured, post-deposition value.
Furthermore, data taken for carrier densities suggest a potential
controllable method to tune carrier density by use of an environmental
chamber. Our results have immediate applicability in the mass production
of millimeter-scale graphene devices, with stable and optimized electrical
properties for a wide range of engineering purposes.
