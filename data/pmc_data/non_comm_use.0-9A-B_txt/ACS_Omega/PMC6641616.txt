The excellent O-regioselectivity of the glycosidation
of the ambident 2-O-substituted 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) via the silver
salt method is computationally investigated at the MP2/6-311++G(2d,p):DZP//B3LYP/6-31+G(d):DZP
level of theory. The reactions studied are those between 1-bromo-1-deoxy-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-α-d-glucopyranose and the silver
salts of 5-FU, 2-O-butyl-5-FU, and 2-O-benzyl-5-FU. Two pathways are considered as follows: (A) one where
the silver and bromide ion do not interact, and (B) another where
the silver and bromide ion interact in the transition states. Because
the O-reaction barriers are much lower (by 13.3–22.2 kcal/mol)
than N-reaction barriers in both pathways, the O-regioselectivity
of the silver salt method can be satisfactorily explained by either
path A or path B. Furthermore, path B, where Ag and Br interact consistently,
has lower activation barriers than the corresponding path A (by 6.8–17.4
kcal/mol) in both N- and O-reactions. This computational result can
be attributed to the following reasons: (1) the speeding-up effect
in Koenigs–Knorr reactions due to the addition of silver carbonate
into the reaction mixture; (2) the halogens being pulled away by silver
ions from halides, as proposed by Kornblum and co-workers; and (3)
the oxocarbenium ion involvement in the glycosidation reactions. The
large energy difference between N- and O-transition states originates
from the association between Ag and N–(O−) of the ambident
unit (−N3–C4=O4) that shows significant covalent
character so that the O-reaction transition states of the silver salt
method benefit from favorable ionic interaction (C+···O–) and favorable covalent interaction (Ag···N).
These two favorable interactions are in agreement with the hard and
soft acids and bases principle; the former is a hard–hard interaction
and the latter is a soft–soft interaction.

==== Body
Introduction
Uracil is one of the
four bases found in RNA, and it metabolizes
into thymine (5-methyl-uracil) in DNA. The replacement of 5-H in uracil
by fluorine introduced the novel property of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
as an anticancer drug through irreversible inhibition of thymidylate
synthase.1−3 Although 5-FU has high antitumor activity, its therapeutic
index is low due to its side effects. Many new 5-FU derivatives, e.g.,
the glycosides of 5-FU, were synthesized to develop more effective
and more selective drugs.4−6 These glycosides are deemed promising
as both sugar and 5-FU units are well-known biologically important
compounds.

The silver salt method is used to synthesize O-glycosides of 5-FU or 2-O-substituted 5-FU (Scheme 1), in which the protected (by
acetyl groups)
and activated (by Br) reacting glucose 1 are α-anomers
and the products 3 are β-anomers. This method has
also been successfully applied to synthesize glycosides of other sugars,
e.g., xylose, methyl glucuronate, and galactose.5,7,8

Scheme 1 Experimental Pathway for the Synthesis of
the O-Glycosides
from 1-Bromo-1-deoxy-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-glucopyranose
and 5-Fluorouracil or 2-O-Substituted 5-Fluorouracil
The silver salt method is based upon the well-known
Koenigs–Knorr
reaction (Scheme 2),7 wherein silver carbonate is added to the substitution
reaction of a glycosyl halide with an alcohol to synthesize a glycoside.
It is observed that the silver carbonate accelerates the rate of the
reaction. However, because an equivalent amount of silver salt is
typically needed, the silver (or other heavy metal) salts are more
appropriately referred to as “promoter” or “coactivator”
rather than catalyst. In the silver salt method, the 2-O-alkyl 5-FU is directly converted into the corresponding silver salt.
The silver salt of the 2-O-substituted 5-FU acts as a glycosyl acceptor
that reacts in nonpolar solvents (usually xylene mixture) with a glycosyl
donor, a protected sugar with a leaving group (usually Br) at its
anomeric center, to form a glycoside. The reactions are heterogeneous
and yield the O-glycoside products (33.2–54.3%
yield).5,8

Scheme 2 Koenigs–Knorr Reaction
The more-than-a-century old
Koenigs–Knorr reaction is still
widely used and continuously modified in pursuit of more effective
syntheses of glycosides.8−10 The silver salt method also plays
an important role in the reactivity of ambident nucleophiles, as the
silver salt method provides the opposite regioselectivity to methods
involving the alkali salts or anions of ambident nucleophiles.11−14 In late 1960s and early 1970s, Tieckelmann and co-workers investigated
alkylations of heterocyclic ambident anions.11 For the alkylation of 2-pyridone salts, the control of the alkylation
site was achieved by manipulation of a few simple variables. Alkylation
was 95–97% on a nitrogen atom in the reaction of the sodium
salt of 2-pyridone with MeI and PhCH2Br in dimethylformamide
(DMF), whereas alkylation was 97–100% on an oxygen atom for
the reaction of the silver salt of 2-pyridone with MeI and PhCH2Br in benzene. In a following study of 4-hydroxypyrimidines,
Tieckelmann et al. observed that the silver salt method gave products
with the O4/N3 alkylation ratio of approximately 5:1, although the
overall yield was only 20–30%.11a Significant steric influence was observed to increase alkylation
at the O4 position at the expense of alkylation at N3. In another
study on the alkylation of 5-carbethoxy- and 5-nitro-2-pyridone salts,11d Tieckelmann and co-workers found that the alkylation
of silver salts in DMF was a homogeneous reaction that yielded both
the N- and O-alkylated products, whereas the corresponding reaction
in hexane and benzene was heterogeneous and resulted in O-alkylation
exclusively. In agreement with the work of Brower et al.,15 Tieckelmann concluded that the deviation of
one reactive path from another occurred at or beyond the transition
state (TS). In 1974, Stein and Tan investigated the alkylation of
the alkali metal and silver salts of formanilides12 and observed results similar to those in the Tieckelmann
studies.

The mechanistic studies on the reactivity of ambident
nucleophiles
have been very active in the past 60 years. In 1955, Kornblum and
co-workers studied the reaction of silver nitrite with alkyl halides13 and suggested that the silver ion most likely
pulls the halogen away from the alkyl halide, thereby enhancing the
carbonium character of the transition state and also enhancing the
O-regioselectivity. Kornblum also proposed the SN1/SN2 borderline mechanism, in which the silver salt method induced
the SN1 reactions due to the formation of carbocation and
the reaction on the oxygen site. In 1968, Pearson summarized experimental
results on the stability of complexes and proposed the hard and soft
acids and bases (HSAB) principle.16 The
HSAB principle gained popularity over the years as it explained many
types of chemical phenomena, including the ambident reactivity. Very
recently, Mayr and co-workers studied the kinetics of the reactions
between benzhydrylium ions and quinone methides and several N- and
O-ambident anions, specifically, nitrite ion, pyridone anions, and
imide and amide anions.14 Mayr et al. also
used alkali salts and the silver salt of these anions to study the
product ratios. In most cases, the reactions happened at the soft
site of the ambident nucleophiles, even in cases where one of the
reactants was a hard carbocation. After reviewing experimental results
on ambidient reactivity, Mayr and co-workers found that the HSAB principle
was wrong in about 50% of the cases and subsequently suggested that
the HSA principle be totally discarded for the study of reactivity
of ambident nucleophiles.17 However, the
silver salt method consistently obtained the O product (with reaction
at the hard site on N/O-ambident nucleophiles). Mayr and co-workers
explained that the O-regioselectivity was due to the blockage of N-attack
through Ag coordination with N-site, but Ayers and co-workers showed
that the HSAB theory could still be used to rationalize ambident reactivity,
as proven by simple chemical potential derivations.18

The oxocarbenium ions from sugars were also found
to be biologically
important. Amyes and Jencks experimentally determined the lifetime
of the oxocarbenium ion of glucose in aqueous solution to be approximately
∼10–12 s.19 Over
the years, Woerpel and co-workers studied and proposed the involvement
of oxocarbenium ions in the syntheses of glycosides.20

The N-regioselectivity of the phase-transfer-catalysis
method was
investigated extensively in a previous publication.21 In this article, we computationally investigated the reactivity
of the N- and O-ambident nucleophiles to account for the observed
O-regioselectivity of the reactions between 1-bromo-1-deoxy-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-glycopyranose (1) and 5-FU, 2-O-butyl-5-FU and 2-O-benzyl-5-FU (2a–c in Scheme 1). The 2-O-butyl-5-FU itself
is an antitumor drug,22 and the benzyl
group of 2-O-benzyl-5-FU serves as a protecting group
in the glycosidation reactions for it can be removed under H2/Pt-C at room temperature after the glycosides are synthesized.23 The substituents are chosen according to their
biological and chemical properties, and there are no detailed experimental
results on their effect on the N/O product ratio. A second objective
is to collaborate relevant aspects of silver salt methods, such as
(1) the speeding-up effect of the Koenigs–Knorr reaction, (2)
the involvement of oxocarbenium ions in the reactions, and (3) the
HSAB principle. Two pathways were considered in the computational
studies: (A) one without any interaction between Ag and Br and (B)
the other wherein Ag and Br interacted in the transition states.

Results
The results are presented in the following order for reactions
between 1 and all three silver salts of 5-FU (2a–c). First, the structures and energies of silver
salts are shown. Second, two reaction pathways are considered: (A)
one wherein the Ag and Br ions do not interact in the transition states
and (B) another wherein the Ag and Br ions interact in the transition
states. The structures and energies of all initial complexes, transition
states, and products for the two pathways are presented. Without a
substituent at O2, 2a is likely to use the ambident unit
of −N1–C2=O2. Only path A is considered for reactions
of 1 + 2a using the ambident unit N3–C4=O4
to make a comparison with reactions of 2-O-substituted 5-FU (2b and 2c). The density analysis results for 2a and 2b, as well as the atomic coordinates
for all species, are provided as the Supporting Information.

Reaction between 1 and the Silver
Salt of 2a
The negative charge of 5-FU anion 2a delocalizes among three atoms (O2, N3, and O4), and the
three structures
optimized at the B3LYP/6-31+G*:DZP level associate the Ag+ separately with O2, N3, and O4 (Figure 1). The expected interactions are shown by
bond critical points (BCPs) between atomic pairs. Both 2a-Ag1 and 2a-Ag3 possess a second BCP separately between
O4 and Ag and between F and Ag, indicating that Ag acts as a bridge
in these two minima, but only the Ag–N and Ag–O have
sizeable electron densities (0.09–0.10e) at
the BCPs. In addition, the geometrical parameters of 2a-Ag1 are very close to those of the 5-FU anion, whereas 2a-Ag3 shows significant changes from 5-FU anion in geometry: the N3–C4
bond length decreases from 1.37 to 1.32 Å, whereas the C4–O4
bond length increases from 1.25 to 1.30 Å (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structures of the 5-FU anion (2a) and its three corresponding
silver salts (2a-Ag1–3) optimized
at the B3LYP/6-31+G*:DZP level. Bond distances (green) were in units
of angstrom.

The 2a-Ag1 is the most stable structure, whereas 2a-Ag2 and 2a-Ag3 are significantly higher in
Gibbs energy (by 39.1 and 26.0 kcal/mol, respectively, Table 1). Therefore, the structure
with Ag···N3 association enhances the amide structure
and provides the thermodynamic stability of the salt of 5-FU anion.
Perron et al.24 and Tao et al.25 obtained crystal structures of the silver salt
of succinimide to model the interaction between silver(I) and the
uracil residue, wherein silver was attached to nitrogen. Only 2a-Ag1 is considered in following calculations.

The silver salt of 5-FU forms complexes
with 1 primarily
through the interaction between the silver ion and the acetyl oxygen
on C3′ (Figure 2). The two optimized reactant complexes are overall similar, except
for the conformation of the acetoxy group on C4′ and the orientation
of fluorine on 5-FU: the N3 complex has a downward C4′ acetoxy
group and an upward fluorine atom, whereas the O4 complex has an upward
C4′ acetoxy group and a downward fluorine atom. The relative
Gibbs energy of the N3 complex with respect to that of the O4 complex
is about 5.0 kcal/mol at the MP2/6-311++G(2d,p):DZP//B3LYP/6-31+G*:DZP
level of theory (Table 2). In two complexes, the distances for Ag···N3 and
Ag···O (the carbonyl O of acetoxy group on C3′)
are ∼2.02 and ∼2.06 Å, respectively, and BCPs are
located between the associated atoms.

In the N3 transition state (TS),
Ag+ moves away from
N3 and comes closer to O4, enabling N3 to react with C1′ (Figure 2). In addition, Ag
maintains the short distance with the acetoxy group on C3′
(2.06 Å), as it does in the initial complex (2.06 Å). In
principle, the O4 transition state (TS) could be formed without losing
Ag···N3 interactions in the O4 complex (Figure 2). However, the optimized O4
TS shows that the silver ion also moves away from N3 and locates between
O2 (rAg···O2 = 2.07 Å)
and the carbonyl oxygen of the acetoxy group on C4′ (rAg···O(=C) = 2.11 Å).
In the meantime, O4 moves closer to and stays above the reaction center
C1′ (Figure 2). The parameters around the C1′ reaction center are similar
for the two transition states: (i) the sum of three angles around
C1′ (∠HC1′C2′ + ∠HC1′O +
∠C2′C1′O; note that the H on C1′ is not
shown in Figure 2)
were both 356°, indicating the near-planarity, (ii) the C1′–O5′
bond distances in N3 and O4 TS were relatively short (1.34 and 1.32
Å, respectively), (iii) both transition states are “loose,”
that is, the C1′···N3 (C1′···O4)
distance is 1.99 Å (1.91 Å), whereas the C2′···Br
distances are 2.96 and 3.04 Å, respectively, and (iv) the ambident
N3–C4=O4 group is also very similar in structure for
both transition states: rC4–N3 =
1.36 Å for N3 TS and 1.35 Å for O4 TS, whereas rC4–O4 = 1.27 Å for both TS structures. Thus,
it is not surprising that the energies also turned out to be similar
for N3 TS and O4 TS (the N3 TS is only 1.4 kcal/mol higher in Gibbs
energy when compared with O4 TS) (Table 2).

In the N3 product and O4 product,
the C1′–N3 bond
and C1′–O4 bond are separately formed between the sugar
ring and the ambident N3–C4=O4 group. The N3–C4=O4
geometrical parameters are markedly different between the two products: rC4–N3 = 1.41 Å and rC4–O4 = 1.23 Å in the N product, as opposed
to rC4–N3 = 1.31 Å and rC4–O4 = 1.32 Å in the O product.
The relative G (N3- minus O4-) value was −22.9
kcal/mol (Table 2 and Figure 2).

It turned
out that the significant energy and parameter changes
occur only when Ag+ associated with different centers of
the ambident N3–C4=O4 group. In the case of the silver
salt of 2a, the structure 2a-Ag1 (with Ag···N3
bond) was 26 kcal/mol lower in energy than the structure 2a-Ag3 (with Ag···O4 bond). For the reaction transition
states, both N- and O-transition states lost Ag···N3
association. Coincidently, two transition states are close in energy
(N TS is 1.4 kcal/mol higher than O TS). In the products, the C1′–N3
bond and C1′–O4 bond are formal covalent bonds between
C1′ and the ambident centers of the −N3–C4=O4
unit so that the association with Ag+ was only a secondary
interaction. Overall, the Gibbs activation energies for N- and O-reactions
are similar: ΔGN‡ = 43.4 kcal/mol and ΔGO‡ = 47.0 kcal/mol (Table 3).

Reaction between 1 and the Silver Salt of 2b
The negative charges in 2-O-butyl-5-FU
anion 2b delocalize between N3 and O4, and two structures 2b-Ag1 and 2b-Ag2 attach
their Ag+ separately to N3 and O4 (Figure 3). The BCPs
are also located between Ag···O4 in 2b-Ag1 and between Ag···F in 2b-Ag2, resulting in bridged structures in both cases. However, these secondary
Ag···O4 and Ag···F associations
are much weaker than the primary ones, as verified by the electron
densities at the BCPs that are only one-third to one-half of those
primary associations (Table S3c). The association
of Ag strongly affects geometrical parameters of the N3–C4=O4 ambident unit (rCN = 1.39 Å and rCO = 1.25 Å in 2b anion; rCN = 1.38 Å and rCO =
1.26 Å in 2b-Ag1; and rCN = 1.34 Å and rCO = 1.30 Å
in 2b-Ag2; Figure 3). The 2b-Ag1 (with the Ag–N3 bond) was 20.4 kcal/mol lower in Gibbs energy than 2b-Ag2 (with the Ag–O4 bond) (Table 4). Again, only 2b-Ag1 is considered
as a reactant in the subsequent calculations.

The silver and bromine ions will
not interact when they are on
the opposite sides of the sugar ring (path A, Figure 4). The silver salt of 2b retains its basic structure
of 2b-Ag1 after it forms the reactant complex with 1. The silver ion attaches to the nitrogen in the 2b anion and also interacts with an oxygen atom in the acetoxy group
at C3′. The structural parameters for the two complexes are
similar; however, there is a 6.9 kcal/mol difference in Gibbs energy
between the two reactant complexes (Table 2). This difference can be attributed to the
different conformations associated with the orientation of the acetoxy
group on C4′ and the n-butyl group in 2b (Figure 4).

transition states (TSs), and products for the reaction between 1 and the silver salt of 2b (path A: noninteracting
Ag and Br). The typical color convention is used to represent carbon
(gray), nitrogen (blue), oxygen (red), fluorine (cyan), bromine (dark
red sphere), and silver (light blue sphere). Bond distances (green)
are in angstrom, and the MP2/6-311++G(2d,p)//B3LYP/6-31+G* relative
(N3- minus O4-) Gibbs energies are in kcal/mol. The Ag and Br ions
are noninteracting.

Two transition states
are located in pathway A, both of which have
an imaginary frequency of i327 cm–1, but independently
lead to the N-glycoside and the O-glycoside. In the transition states, the N- (or O-) center attacks
the anomeric carbon C1′ and expels Br– from
the opposite side of C1′. The two transition states have very
similar structural parameters for the sugar unit and show SN2 characteristics: (1) C1′–Br is approximately 3.0
Å and C1′–N3 (or C1′–O4) is 1.95
Å (or 1.85 Å); (2) the anomeric C1′ has a near-planar
structure (the sums of the three angles around C1′∠HC1′C2′
+ ∠HC1′O + ∠C2′C1′O are 354–355°);
(3) the Hirshfeld charges also show that the ring oxygen has a relatively
small negative charge (−0.12e), whereas C1′
has a relatively small positive charge (0.19–0.20e). As expected, most of the negative charge is found on the Br ion
(∼−0.70e). The main difference between
the two TS structures lies in the long-distance interactions between
Ag+ and the ambident −N3–C4=O4 unit:
(1) in the N3-reaction transition state, the C1′···N3
interaction is coupled with a Ag–O4 bond; (2) in the O4-reaction
transition state, the C1′···O4 interaction is
coupled with a Ag–N3 bond. Although the atomic distances for
the coupled interactions are similar (1.85–2.09 Å), the
Ag···N3 and Ag···O4 interactions share
more electron density at BCPs than those involving C1′: the
electron densities at the BCPs are separately 0.112e and 0.098e for the Ag–N3 and Ag–O4
bonds and 0.083e and 0.081e for
C1′···N3 and C1′···O4
bonds, respectively. The relative G of the N3 TS
(with Ag–O4 bond) with respect to that of O4 TS (with Ag–N3
bond) is 26.5 kcal/mol (Table 2 and Figure 4).

For the products in pathway A, the C1′–N (or
C1′–O)
bond is a typical covalent bond. The silver ion maintains its interactions
with O4 and with the carbonyl oxygen atoms in the acetoxy groups on
C3′ and C6′ in the N product and with N3 and the carbonyl
oxygen in the acetoxy group on C3′ in the O product. However,
the Ag–N3 and Ag–O4 bonds are much weaker than the C1′–O4
and C1′–N3 bonds in the products (Table 7). The Gibbs free energy of the amide N product
is −20.1 kcal/mol compared to that of the imidate O product
(Table 2 and Figure 4).

An alternate
pathway (path B with interacting Ag and Br) requires
not only that the ambident centers be positioned toward the anomeric
C1′ but also that the Ag and Br ions move closer in the reactions.
Two such complexes are located either through an Ag···O
type interaction involving the ring oxygen atom (N complex) or through
Ag···Br type interaction (O complex). It is noticeable
that the orientation of the butyl group is different in two complexes
and the N complex is 3.7 kcal/mol lower than O complex (Table 2 and Figure 5).

Figure 5 B3LYP/6-31+G* optimized structures of the N3-
and O4-reactant,
transition states, and product complexes for the reaction of 1 with the silver salt of 2b (path B with interacting
Ag and Br). The typical color convention was used to represent carbon
(gray), nitrogen (blue), oxygen (red), fluorine (cyan), bromine (dark
red sphere), and silver (light blue sphere). Bond distances (green)
were in angstrom, and the MP2/6-311++G(2d,p)//B3LYP/6-31+G* relative
(N3- minus O4-) Gibbs energies were in kcal/mol.

The Ag is allowed to approach the leaving Br, whereas one
of the
ambident centers is allowed to approach anomeric C1′ in the
transition states. Two transition states are found to possess tiny
single imaginary frequencies (i35.6 and i37.7 cm–1 separately for O TS and N TS). The transition states are more “exploded”
(looser) than transition states in pathway A wherein Ag and Br did
not interact: The C1′···O and C1′···N
distances are in the range 2.57–2.70 Å, and the C1′···Br
distances are in the range 3.33–3.63 Å, but the Ag···Br
distances are relatively short (2.397–2.431 Å). Thus,
both oxocarbenium ion 4 and AgBr molecule are developed
to give a character of 4 + 2b + AgBr with two unique features in these transition states: (1) the oxocarbenium
ion 4 does not have the neighboring-group participation
from acetoxy group on C2′; (2) the Ag end of AgBr still attaches
to one of the ambident centers. Although Ag···Br distances
are short in the transition states, the Ag···N and
Ag···O distances are even shorter (2.016–2.055
Å). At the MP2/6-311++G(2d,p):DZP//B3LYP/6-31+G*:DZP level of
theory, the Ag–N3 or Ag–O4 interactions share more electrons
at the BCPs (0.11e) compared with the Ag–Br
bond (∼0.08e). The O TS with Ag···N3
association is 15.4 kcal/mol lower than the N TS with Ag···O4
association.

The C–N3 or C–O4 bonds are
fully formed covalent bonds in the products (Figure 5), which are much stronger than the Ag–N3
and Ag–O4 interactions. The N3 product is an amide, and the
O4 product is an imidate. The free energy of the N-glycoside is 6.3
kcal/mol higher than that of the O4-glycoside at the MP2/6-311++G(2d,p):DZP//B3LYP/6-31+G*:DZP
level of theory.

For the reaction kinetics, the activation barriers
in pathway B
for the N-reaction and O-reaction are 29.8 and 10.7 kcal/mol, respectively,
and the corresponding activation barriers in pathway A are 47.2 and
27.6 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 3). One could describe such a reaction in pathway B
as being “prompted” by Ag···Br interactions
as opposed to pathway A.

Reaction between 1 and the Silver
Salt of 2c
Again, the negative charges in 2-O-benzyl-5-FU anion 2c delocalize onto N3 and
O4 and the geometry optimization of the silver salt of 2c yields two stable structures (Figure 6). In 2c-Ag1, the silver ion
attaches to N3 and bends slightly toward O2 but
the BCP is not located between Ag and O2. In 2c-Ag2, the silver ion attaches to O4 and bends toward fluorine.
A BCP is found between Ag and F, giving this second minimum a ringlike
feature (Figure 6 and Table 5). The association
of Ag with either N3 or O4 center of the −N3–C4=O4–
ambident unit influences the stability of silver salts. The 2c-Ag1 with the Ag–N3 bond, in particular, was −20.6
kcal/mol lower in Gibbs free energy than that of 2c-Ag2 with the Ag–O4 bond (Table 6). Once again, only 2c-Ag1 is considered
in the subsequent calculations.

Two pathways are considered for 1 + 2c + Ag+ reactions: (A) a pathway
wherein the silver and bromide ions are noninteracting (Figure 7) and (B) the other pathway
wherein the silver and bromide ions are interacting (Figure 8).

states, and products for the reactions between 1 and
the silver salt of 2c (Ag+ and Br– were noninteracting). The typical color convention was used to represent

(dark red sphere), and silver (light blue sphere). Bond distances

relative (N3- minus O4-) Gibbs energies were in kcal/mol.

Figure 8 B3LYP/6-31+G*:DZP optimized structures of initial complexes,
transition
states, and products for the reactions between 1 and
the silver salt of 2c, with interacting Ag+ and Br– ions (path B). The typical color convention
was used to represent carbon (gray), nitrogen (blue), oxygen (red),
fluorine (cyan), bromine (dark red sphere), and silver (light blue
sphere). Bond distances (green) are in angstrom, and the MP2/6-311++G(2d,p)//B3LYP/6-31+G*
relative (N3- minus O4-) Gibbs energies are in kcal/mol.

In path A that has noninteracting Ag and Br ions,
Ag+ is stabilized by interactions with the carbonyl oxygen
on the acetoxy
group on C3′ or C2′, whereas Br– is
positioned far away from Ag+ on the opposite side of the
sugar ring (Figure 7). This arrangement is seen in all reaction intermediates, namely,
in the initial reactant complexes, transition states, and products
for both N- and O-reactions.

Both N3- and O4-reactant complexes
of path A possess short Ag···N3
bond lengths (2.03 and 2.02 Å, respectively). Furthermore, the
Ag···O (carbonyl oxygen on C2′ acetoxy group)
bond length is 2.11 Å in the N3-reactant complex and 2.05 Å
in the O4-reactant complex (Figure 7). These results suggest that the silver ion acts as
a bridge to form initial complexes. The free energy of the N-reactant
complex is 8.8 kcal/mol higher than that of the O complex (Table 2 and Figure 7), and the conformational difference
of the acetoxy and benzyl groups is most likely responsible for this
energy difference.

In the N3-TS structure of path A, the silver
ion loses Ag···N3
interaction but establishes two new Ag···O interactions
with (i) the carbonyl oxygen of the C3′ acetoxy group and (ii)
O4 of 5-FU to facilitate the optimal orientation for N3 to attack
C1′ and expel Br–. In the O4 TS structure,
the Ag···N3 and Ag···O (carbonyl oxygen
of the C3′ acetoxy group) associations from the reactant complex
are preserved, and O4 of 5-FU is found to be in closer proximity to
C1′. In addition, the C1′–Br bond length of both
N3 and O4 transition states increases to ∼3.0 Å as Br– continues with its departure. The Ag···N3
interaction possesses the largest electron density at the BCP of 0.107e, when compared with the electron density at the Ag–O4
BCP (∼0.083e) and at the partially formed
C1′–N3 and C1′–O4 bonds (0.085e and 0.093e, respectively). The electron
density at the BCPs of the C1′–Br bonds in both N3 and
O4 TS structures is even smaller (∼0.020e)
(Table 7). The N3 TS structure (without the Ag–N3 bond)
is 22.1 kcal/mol higher in free energy than the O4 TS (with the Ag–N3
bond) (Table 2 and Figure 7).

b Path A: the Ag and Br do not interact,
cf. Figure 7.

In both N3 and O4 products, the
Ag and Br ions are still located
on opposite sides of the sugar ring and the silver ion is still stabilized
by the Ag···O (carbonyl oxygen of the C3′ acetoxy
group) interaction but the N3 product forms a formal C–N bond
and the O4 product forms a formal C–O bond, significantly affecting
the structural parameters of the ambident unit (−N3–C4=O4).
The N3 product is 14.6 kcal/mol higher in Gibbs energy than the O4
product. It is possible that the steric effect contributes to the
lower stability of the N product when compared to that of the O product.

In the path B wherein Ag and Br are allowed to interact, two complexes
are obtained from properly oriented reactants (Figure 8). The Ag···O distances in
the initial complexes are in the range 2.25–2.30 Å and
both involve oxygen on the sugar ring (either the ring O between C5′
and C1′ or the O of the acetoxy group on C6′). The significant
Gibbs energy difference between the two complexes is possibly due
to different conformations of the benzyl group, as well as an electron-correlation
effect (N complex is 11.3 kcal/mol lower than O complex).

The
transition states of pathway B are “loose”: the
C1′···N and C1′···O distances
are in the range 2.61–2.68 Å, and the C1′···Br
distances are in the range 3.25–3.75 Å, which lends support
to the possible formation of oxocarbenium ion 4. The
Ag···Br distances are in the range 2.39–2.45
Å, which is in agreement with the formation of the AgBr molecule.
The single imaginary frequencies are i26.1 and i51.1 cm–1 for N TS and O TS, respectively. Again, two unique features are
noticeable for the transition states: (1) the oxocarbenium ion does
not have the neighboring-group participation from acetoxy group on
C2′, (2) the Ag end of AgBr attaches to either N- or O- of
the ambident −N3–C4=O4 unit (2.02–2.08
Å). The O4 TS structure with the Ag···N3 interaction
is 11.9 kcal/mol less in Gibbs energy than the N3-TS structure with
the Ag···O4 interaction at the MP2/6-311++G(2d,p):DZP//B3lYP/6-31+G*:DZP
level of theory (Table 2 and Figure 8).

The AgBr unit still attaches to N3 in the O4 product (O4 in N3
product), but the Ag···N3 and Ag···O4
interactions are much weaker (i.e., electron density at the BCPs are
0.088e and 0.083e) than the newly
formed C1′–N3 and C1′–O4 (i.e., electron
densities at the BCPs are separately 0.250e and 0.246e, Table 8). The Gibbs free energy of the N product is 9.6 kcal/mol higher
than that of the O product (Figure 8 and Table 2). This significant difference is once again possibly due
to the steric effect that is more pronounced in the N product than
in the O product.

b Path B: with interacting Ag and
Br, cf. Figure 8.

The overall
activation barriers in pathway B are 37.1 and 13.9
kcal/mol for the N-reaction and O-reaction (Table 3), respectively. These values are lower than
those of the corresponding activation barriers in pathway A (43.9
and 30.6 kcal/mol, respectively). Once again, the interaction between
Ag and Br increases reaction rates for both the N- and O-reactions
in the case of 1 + 2c + Ag+.

Discussion
Oxocarbenium Ion
The free oxocarbenium ion 4 (carbocation) can be stabilized
by two factors (Figure 9): (1) participation of the
neighboring acetoxy group at C2′; (2) delocalization of the
lone electron pairs on the ring oxygen to the cationic C1′
center. Indeed, the optimized structure of 4 showed (1)
an additional five-membered ring structure and (2) a rather short
C1′–O bond (1.34 Å).

Figure 9 Lowest-energy oxocarbenium
ion structure optimized at the B3LYP/6-31+G*
level, with the hydrogen atoms excluded for clarity and bond distances
(green) in angstrom.

Efforts are made to investigate the neighboring-group participation,
such as Figure 9 in
the transition states (Figures S1 and S2). If oxocarbenium ion 4 exists in its most stable structure
as in Figure 9, it
can form oxocarbenium ion complexes with 2b-AgBr (or 2c-AgBr), then obtain the products via very shallow transition
states. The optimized transition states do not have the five-membered
ring; the C1′···O (carbonyl O of acetoxy group
on C2′) distances are in the range 2.08–3.23 Å,
and no BCPs were located for this interaction. The results indicate
that the neighboring group (acetoxy group on C2′) can trap
the oxocarbenium ion but the N3- or O4-reactions will still prevent
the participation of the neighboring group. Such transition states
are hard to locate on the potential energy surface for some reactions
due to the complication of methyl rotations and weak interactions,
so the oxocarbenium ion complexes are used to estimate the activation
barriers for 4 + 2b-AgBr (Figure S1), and the N3 TS structure for 4 + 2c-AgBr is obtained from the optimization at B3LYP/3-21G level
of theory (Figure S2). The reaction activation
barriers are 30.7 and 12.2 kcal/mol for N3-reaction and O4-reaction
in the case of 4 + 2b-AgBr, respectively.
These energies are slightly higher than those (29.8 and 10.7 kcal/mol, Figure 5 and Table 3) obtained for pathway B of 1 + 2b + Ag+ reaction (with no participation of the acetoxy group on C2′).
In the case of the 4 + 2c-AgBr reaction (Figure S2), the activation barriers are 55.3
and 10.1 kcal/mol for N3-reaction and O4-reaction, respectively. The
former is overestimated because the transition-state structure is
adopted from a lower-level optimization (B3LYP/3-21G). The activation
barriers are 37.1 and 13.9 kcal/mol separately for N3-reaction and
O4-reaction, respectively, from pathway B without the participation
of the neighboring acetoxy group at C2′ (Figure 8 and Table 3). Although oxocarbenium ion 4 with its
most stable form (Figure 9) leads to two important conclusions: (1) the N3-reactions
are also much less favorable than O4-reactions; (2) the product glycosides
will be β-anomers, it is not required that oxocarbenium ion 4 is stabilized by neighboring-group participation in the
transition states because these two conclusions are also satisfactorily
explained by pathway B.

Two other reasons may also give argument
against the involvement
of the neighboring acetoxyl group (as in Figure 9) in the transition states: (1) the involvement
of the acetoxy group in the transition states requires a conformational
rearrangement of the acetoxy group (from an upward to a downward position
on the ring) to form the oxocarbenium ion 4 in Figure 9; (2) there will
be significant repulsion between the downward acetoxy group on C2′
and the leaving Br atom before the reactions reach the transition
states. This reasoning suggests that the oxocarbenium ion 4 forms in the transition states of pathway B but does not rely on
the neighboring acetoxyl group participation, even though free oxocarbenium
ion 4 is apparently stabilized by the neighboring-group
participation effect (Figure 9).

Conformation, Steric, Electron-Correlation,
Solvent, and Association
Effects
The energies of N-reactant complexes are typically
very similar to those of O-reactant complexes owing to the absence
of strong interactions between the 5-FU and sugar units. The strong
interactions would have otherwise pulled the sugar unit closer to
either the N3 or O4 center. This lack of strong interactions may explain
why the free-energy differences between N complexes and O complexes
are usually less than 8.0 kcal/mol. In some cases, conformation effects
noticeably affect the Gibbs energy differences between the N complex
and the O complex; the biggest difference of 11.3 kcal/mol was found
between the N and O complexes for pathway B of the Ag–Br-interacting
reaction (1 + 2c + Ag+) (Table 2 and Figure 8).

The ambident unit in the N3 product with the C1′–N3
bond is an amide (−C1′–N3–C4=O4),
whereas the ambident unit in the O4 product with the C1′–O4
bond is an imidate (−C1′–O4–C4=N3−).
The amide product is generally more stable than the imidate product;
however, the steric effects experienced by the N3 product can reverse
the relative stability due to the more hindered nature of the two
big units brought together by rather short C1′–N3 bonds
(1.4–1.5 Å). Thus, the relative single-point energies
of N products can be both negative and positive (−24.6–11.9
kcal/mol) when compared with O products at the MP2/6-311++G(2d,p):DZP//B3LYP/6-31+G*
level of theory. The biggest positive single-point energy difference
between the N3 and the O4 products is 11.9 kcal/mol in the 1 + 2c + Ag+ reaction
(pathway A, without free-energy correction, Table 2).

At the B3LYP/6-31+G* level of theory,
the free-energy corrections
from total electronic energy are usually small (−1.7–3.0
kcal/mol) for the differences of complexes, transition states, and
products, whereas the solvent effect corrections give similar contributions
(−1.6–3.5 kcal/mol). The biggest solvent effect was
found in the initial complexes for pathway B of 1 + 2c + Ag+ reactions, in
which the solvent effect contributes 11.0 kcal/mol to the energy difference
between the N complex and the O complex (Table 2). Interestingly, the biggest electron-correlation
effect (−11.3 kcal/mol) was also found for the initial complexes
for pathway B of 1 + 2c + Ag+ reaction (Table 2).

The obvious association effect is
demonstrated in the stability
of the silver salts of 2-O-substituted 5-FU and the relative energies
of N- and O-transition states. The association of Ag with N- or O-
usually makes an energy difference in the range of 11.9–26.5
kcal/mol (Table 2)
in these two situations, i.e., the association effect has the greatest
impact on reaction kinetics among a variety of factors.

Nature of the
Association Effect
The silver ion was
found to associate with the ambident N- and O-centers in initial complexes,
transition states, and products. These associations have noticeable
electron density at BCPs (0.05–0.111e) that
is different from that of typical ionic bonds; these interactions
also have positive Laplacian values at BCPs that are indicative of
electron density depletion, whereas the typical covalent chemical
bonds have negative Laplacian values at the BCPs that are indicative
of an electron density accumulation. Figure 10 shows the density contours and Laplacian
plots of the N transition state for a model reaction (HN–CH=O)Ag
+ CH3–F. It is clear that all long-distance interactions
have positive Laplacian at the BCPs (Figure 10b) but Ag–O bond has the largest
density at the BCP, judged from the contour values (Figure 10a).

Figure 10 (a) Electron density
(the values from outmost to inner contours
are 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 au,
...), (b) Laplacian of the electron density (solid lines correspond
to negative values, and dotted lines correspond to positive values)
for N transition state of the (HN–CH=O)Ag + CH3–F reaction optimized at the CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ:DZP//MP2/6-31+G*:DZP
level. The bond critical points (BCPs) are crossing points between
bond paths and vector lines. Although this transition state shows
an additional BCP between Ag and C, it is very close to the ring critical
point, making this BCP insignificant.

The “exploded” (loose) nature of the transition
states
signifies the importance of the association effect. In pathway A wherein
the Ag+ and Br– ions do not interact,
the partially formed C1′···N3 (1.96–1.99
Å) and C1′···O4 (1.85–1.91 Å)
bonds are rather long and the atomic distances of the Ag···O4
(2.02–2.07 Å) and Ag···N3 (∼2.04
Å) interactions that accompanied these partially formed C1′···N3
and C1′···O4 bonds, respectively, are similar
in length. Both Ag and C1′ are interacting with N3 (O4) but
attaching to the opposite ends of the N3–C4=O4 unit
in the transition states. In pathway B where the Ag+ and
Br– interact, both the oxocarbenium ion and AgBr
molecule are nearly formed in the transition states. The atomic distances
of Ag···O4 (2.02 Å) and Ag···N3
(2.079 Å) interactions remained around 2.0 Å, but the C1′···N3
or C1′···O4 distances increase to 2.61–2.68
Å. It is noticeable that the Ag···N3 and Ag···O4
distances were close to those in silver salt of 2-O-substituted 5-FU.

The stability of O4 TS structures can be attributed to two factors
as follows: (1) the electrostatic interactions between C1′
and O4 and (2) the covalent interactions between Ag and N3. The fact
that the anomeric carbon C1′, N3, and O4 have charges in the ranges of 0.155–0.250e, −0.131e to −0.229e, and −0.195e to −0.362e, respectively (Tables S2b–S4b, S7 and 7), suggests that the electrostatic attractions are in favor
of the C1′···O4 interactions over C1′···N3
interactions. Furthermore, because the electron densities at the BCPs
were found to be higher in the Ag···N3 (0.096–0.107e) and Ag···O4 (0.087–0.099e) bonds than in the C1′···O4 (0.023–0.094e) and C1′···N3 bonds (0.020–0.086e) and the density at the BCP of Ag–Br bond is in
between 0.071e and 0.080e (Tables S2c–S4c and 8), this suggests that covalent interactions exist between Ag and
N3. Consequently, the O-reaction transition states have the strongest
Ag···N3 associations amongst all of the long-distance
associations, which in turn possess the strongest “amide”
character in the ambident unit (N3–C4=O4) among all
transition states.

Reaction Mechanism of the Silver Salt Method
The theoretical
results satisfactorily explained the O-regioselectivity in the synthesis
of glycosides of 5-FU using the silver salt method (1 + 2b + Ag+ and 1 + 2c + Ag+), as the O-reaction barriers were calculated to be much lower (by
13.3–22.2 kcal/mol) than N-reaction barriers for both paths
A and B. Although the blockage of N-site by Ag can also explain the
O-regioselectivity, our results further support the well-known observations
and advantages of silver salt methods: (1) the speeding-up effect
due to the addition of silver carbonate in the Koenigs–Knorr
reaction; (2) Kornblum and co-workers’ proposal on silver salt
methods; (3) the involvement of the oxocarbenium ion in the synthesis
of glycosides of 5-FU; and (4) the successful application of the HSAB
principle in interpreting the silver salt method.

Path B effectively
produces oxocarbenium ion in the transition states and possesses lower
(by 6.8–16.9 kcal/mol) activation barriers than corresponding
activation barriers of path A. The addition of Ag2CO3 could speed up the glycosidation reaction in the Koenigs–Knorr
method, which can be attributed to the interaction between Ag and
Br in path B. Because a stoichiometric amount of Ag2CO3 is usually needed, the one-on-one association more likely
happens in the Koenigs–Knorr reactions.

In the alkylation
with the silver salt method, Kornblum proposed
that the silver pulled the halogen and enhanced the carbonium ion
contribution to the transition state.15 The geometry parameters of transition states support the interpretation
using SN1/SN2 borderline mechanism. The C1′–N3/O4
and C1′–Br distances are shorter in pathway A than in
pathway B, and the oxocarbenium ions are effectively formed in the
transition states of pathway B. Therefore, the transition states of
pathway A have more SN2 characteristics and the transition
states of pathway B have more SN1 characteristics. However,
SN1/SN2 borderline mechanism only focuses on
C1′ interactions and neglects the Ag interactions in the transition
states. It is the association effect of Ag that significantly affects
the energetics of transition states and in turn determines the O-regioselectivity
in silver salt methods.

The Ag prefers the N site over O site
of the ambident unit, which
is supported by current calculations on all silver salts of 2-O-substituted
5-FU and by some reported crystal structures: (1) For silver salts
of 2-substituted 5-FU, the structures with Ag–N3 bond have
a large energy preference over those with Ag–O4 bond (by ∼20
kcal/mol); (2) the crystal structure of the silver salt of succinimide
showed Ag–N3 connection.43,44 These results are in
perfect agreement with the HSAB principle: the Ag···N
interaction is favorable soft–soft interaction and Ag···O
interaction is less favorable soft–hard interaction. Our calculations
further show that the O-reaction transition states benefit from two
favorable factors: (1) the C1′···O ionic interaction
and (2) the strong Ag···N covalent interaction. The
results again appear to be in good accord with the hard soft acids
and bases (HSAB) principle: (1) the C1′···O
interaction is of ionic character, which is hard–hard interaction;
(2) the Ag···N interaction is of covalent character,
which is soft–soft interaction.

Conclusions
Because
of the conformational flexibility, significant size of
the substituent groups, the formation of complexes, and the impact
of different reaction media, many factors affect the reaction kinetics:
conformation effect, steric effect, electron-correlation effect, solvent
effect, and association effect. The association effect has the greatest
impact on reaction kinetics among a variety of factors.

The
effect of 2-O-substitutional groups (in the order of no-substitution,
butyl, and benzyl) is small, but the greatest hindering effect (the
highest barrier) is found with the butyl group in the N-reaction,
and the trend of increasing barriers is noted in the O-reactions in
the order of none, butyl, and benzyl group.

The synthesis of
glycoside of 2-O-substituted 5-FU with the silver
salt method may proceed through two pathways: (A) there is no interaction
between Ag and Br in the transition state; (B) Ag and Br interact
in the transition states. Because the O-reaction barriers are much
lower (by 13.3–22.2 kcal/mol) than N-reaction barriers in both
path A and path B, the O-regioselectivity with the silver salt method
is satisfactorily explained by either path A or path B.

The
results of the barriers of pathway B (Ag and Br interact) being
lower than the barriers of pathway A (by 6.8–16.9 kcal/mol)
can further explain three points: (1) the speeding-up effect in Koenigs–Knorr
reactions due to the addition of silver carbonate to the reaction
mixture; (2) the halogens are pulled away by silver ion from halides;
and (3) the oxocarbenium ion is involved in the glycosidation reactions
but the neighboring acetoxyl group participation is not found in the
transition states.

Kornblum and co-workers’ proposal
of SN1/SN2 borderline mechanism focused on hard–hard
interaction
between C1′ and ambident NH–CH=O– unit and neglected the soft–soft Ag···N interaction.
The O-reaction transition states benefit from both hard–hard
C1′···O interaction and soft–soft Ag···N
interaction, and the soft–soft interaction is more important
due to the significant covalent character of Ag/N-(O-) interactions
in the “loose” transition states.

The hard and
soft acids and bases (HSAB) principle can be used
to explain the stability of the transition states for the glycosidation
reactions in the silver salt methods. The explanation that the Ag
ion blocks the N-site agrees with experimental results; however, it
is unable to provide information or insight on the kinetics of the
reaction.

Computational Methods
Usually, the sugar ring in 1 adopts a chair form and
the butyl group in 2 adopts zigzag conformers. This trend
is also confirmed by conformational search using the MMFF94 force
field26 and the Global-MMX steric energy
minimization program in PCMODEL.27 In addition,
the unit 2 is positioned properly through the Ag bridging
between acetyl groups of 1 so that there is favorable
interaction (or no interaction) between Ag and Br. The actual structures
of initial complexes, transition states, and products are fully optimized
using the Becke three-parameter Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP)
functional28 paired with two double-zeta
basis sets: B3LYP/6-31+G*:DZP. The basis set notation denoted the
use of Pople’s standard 6-31+G* basis set29 for the C, H, N, O, F, and Br atoms and the DZP basis set
for Ag.30 The latter was obtained from
the EMSL website.31 The frequency calculations
are also performed at the same level of theory to verify that each
optimized structure is either a minimum with no imaginary frequency
or a transition state with one imaginary frequency, i.e., first-order
saddle point on the potential energy surface. The frequency calculations
provide the thermal corrections to the Gibbs free energy (Gcorr) that already incorporates the zero-point
vibrational energy.32 The quadratic synchronous
transit approach by Schlegel and co-workers33 that requires a reactant and product as its input (QST2) or the
reactant, the product, and an initial guess for the transition state
as input (QST3) is used to optimize transition-state structures.

Single-point energies are additionally calculated using both density
functional theory34 and conventional ab
initio techniques incorporating electron-correlation effects such
as the Møller–Plesset second-order (MP2) perturbation
theory.35 Specifically, single-point energies
are evaluated using the M06-2X Minnesota global hybrid functional36 with 6-311++G(3df,2p) or 6-311++G(2d,p)37 (for C, H, O, N, F, and Br) and DZP basis sets
(for Ag). The double forward slash “//” in M06-2x/6-311++G(3df,2p):DZP//B3LYP/6-31+G*:DZP
denotes the computation of the M06-2x/6-311++G(3df,2p):DZP energies
of the structures optimized at the more cost-effective B3LYP/6-31+G*:DZP
level. The M06 suite of functionals requires fine integration grids
to obtain correct reaction energies,38 so
an ultrafine integration grid with 99 radial shells and 590 angular
points per shell was used in the M06-2X calculations in this study.
Single-point energies were further evaluated at the MP2/6-311++G(2d,p):DZP//B3LYP/6-31+G*:DZP
level. The atomic charges are obtained from a Hirshfeld population
analysis.39

The SMD solvation model
of Truhlar and co-workers40 is used to
obtain the corresponding reaction and activation
free energies in xylene mixture (dielectric constant of 2.3879). Because
geometrical parameters and energies of the conformers of the ionic
test cases are not significantly impacted by the inclusion of solvents,
the gas-phase free energies are utilized all throughout in assessing
the preference for the O over the N product. Nevertheless, the solvated
single-point free energies of the complex, transition state, and product
are presented in all tables, alongside their gas-phase counterparts.

The density analysis was done within the framework of the quantum
theory of atoms in molecules.41,42 In this approach, a
chemical bond was defined by a bond path through total density analysis
rather than by an arbitrary line. Bond critical point (BCP) is a point
on the bond path that has the minimal density on two directions and
maximum density on one direction, i.e., it has a ranking of (3, −1)
in the topology of density. The density and the Laplacian of the density
at the bond critical points (BCPs) indicate the magnitudes of shared
electrons and bond characters, either by way of accumulating density
(a negative number of Laplacian) or depleting density (a positive
number of Laplacian).

All ab initio calculations are carried
out with GAUSSIAN program
packages.43 Wavefunction files obtained
from GAUSSIAN program are used for the density analysis AIMPAC44 suite of programs.
