A strategy
toward the integration of highly functional microporous materials, such as metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs), in composites via biochemical recognition interactions
is presented. Postsynthetic modification of zeolitic-imidazolate framework-8
MOF nanocrystals with a maltose-exposing biocompatible surfactant
(the so-called “Glyco-MOFs”) was performed to confer
affinity toward lectin protein concanavalin A. The addition of small
amounts of concanavalin A to the colloidal Glyco-MOF dispersion triggers
the aggregation of these units into self-limited size supramolecular
architectures directed by specific sugar–lectin binding interactions.

Introduction
Recently,
a new class of organic–inorganic crystalline porous
materials, known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), has emerged.
MOFs are highly ordered structures that can be described in terms
of metal ions as centers (or metal-containing clusters), connected
coordinately by multidentate organic chelating agents acting as linkers.1−4 Due to the overwhelming number of organic linkers and metal combinations
possible, a broad variety of materials with many different features
can be obtained. Among many interesting characteristics, MOFs exhibit
high surface areas, a wide range of pore sizes and shapes, and a great
variety of chemical functionalities exposed in the pore.5 Zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (or ZIFs) constitute
a particularly well-characterized and studied MOF subclass. ZIFs can
be described as M–Im–M tridimensional porous networks,
where M stands for tetrahedrally coordinated Zn2+ or Co2+ metal ions and Im represents an imidazolate or imidazolate-derived
N-bidentate organic linker.6,7 Due to its straightforward
synthesis methods, high surface areas, and relatively high stability
(both thermal and toward hydrolysis in neutral aqueous solutions),
ZIF-8 (constituted by Zn2+ ions and 2-methylimidazole (HmIm)
bidentate linker) is an appealing material widely used for water-based
applications, including many examples related to biomedicine and nanobiotechnology.8−17

Much effort has been devoted in MOF research to the development
of strategies allowing modification of their bulk structure and pore
surface chemistry, to, e.g., confer differential affinity toward energy
or environmentally relevant adsorbates,18 or introducing structural defects, which could act as catalytic
sites or create some degree of mesoporosity in an otherwise strictly
microporous framework.19 Modification of
external surface in MOF films and nanocrystals has received relatively
less attention,20−26 although it provides an ideal tool for many interesting applications,
as increasingly recognized by the nanobioscience research community.27 To mention one of the many examples, it has
been recently reported that an immune system recognition response
decrease was caused by surface-confined positioning of a biopolymer
on MOF nanocrystals.28,29

Carbohydrates and carbohydrate-containing
polymers constitute a
predominant class of biologically relevant molecules acting in a multitude
of biochemical processes, such as cellular recognition, inflammation,
and signal transmission. The ability of carbohydrate-exposing synthetic
materials to mimic such functional response has attracted increasing
interest of the biomaterials community.30,31 Carbohydrates
can form many hydrogen bonds, an interesting feature for further developments
as a tool in supramolecular chemistry, due to the possibility of interaction
with other carbohydrates and proteins.32 The presence of multiple surface-exposed carbohydrates increases
the binding strength conferred by individual interactions to yield
synergetic multivalent interactions.33,34 Supramolecular
assemblies exposing carbohydrates in their surface include among other
organic macrocycles (such as cyclodextrins (CDs)), glycoclusters and
glycodendrimers, and glycopolymers.35 Particularly,
in recent years, we have witnessed an increased interest in the combination
of nanomaterials and carbohydrates. Research efforts on this matter
are often referred to as glyconanotechnology, a term popularized by
Penadés and co-workers.31 Great
strides in glyconanotechnology have been made as a result of the creation
of different bioactive glyconanostructures for various health-related
applications, such as drug delivery, gene therapy, pathogen detection,
toxin inhibition, and lectin-based biosensors.36−40 In this sense, advances oriented to the incorporation
of such functionalities in MOFs and MOF-containing composites have
been focused on replacing usual organic linkers with carbohydrate
supramolecular assemblies, such as cyclodextrins (CDs), yielding edible
porous materials, the so-called CD-MOFs.41−44

Alkyl-polyglucosydes (APG)
are nontoxic, sugar-based surfactants45 with low surface tension and good electrolyte
tolerance. An example of APG is the n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM). DDM adsorbs strongly over hydrophobic surfaces
forming monolayers.46 DDM monolayers allow
its use as a stabilizing agent for colloidal suspensions of nonpolar
nanoparticles in polar solvents, adding the interesting feature of
surface positioning of hydrophilic maltoside residues.

In this
work, we have used a simple and straightforward noncovalent
surface modification of ZIF-8 MOF nanocrystals to create surface-exposed
sugar moieties, which are meant to confer the lectin-recognition properties.
Our studies were aimed to explore the possibility of forming colloidal
sugar-modified ZIF-8 nanocrystals, which can offer the possibility
of recognition-driven assembly in the presence of concanavalin A (Con
A), a well-studied lectin protein commonly used for in vitro biological
essays.35,37 We demonstrate that DDM serves as a suitable
dispersing and stabilizing agent for ZIF-8 colloids; furthermore,
its presence significantly affects the interactions between ZIF-8
nanocrystals and Con A. Due to the presence of sugar moieties exposed
at ZIF-8 surface, the addition of small amounts of Con A to the colloidal
dispersion triggers the aggregation of functionalized ZIF-8 nanocrystals
as a result of specific sugar–lectin binding interactions.

Results
and Discussion
Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
Glyco-ZIF-8
colloidal
suspensions formation was in situ monitored via DLS. Figure 1 shows the final size distributions
obtained for the following systems: (a) 2 mM DDM, (b) ZIF-8 formed
by direct mixing as discussed below, and (c) a mixture of ZIF-8 colloidal
suspension obtained in (a) with DDM for the same final concentration.

Figure 1 Hydrodynamic
diameter distribution measured by DLS for: (a) 2 mM
DDM solution, which yields monodisperse micelles; (b) ZIF-8 nanocrystals
formed after direct mixing of precursors; and (c) ZIF-8 nanocrystals
colloidal suspension obtained in (b) with 2 mM DDM solution. For each
plot, a schematic illustration of the system obtained is also presented.

Shortly after mixing ZIF-8 colloidal
nanocrystals suspension and
DDM solution for a final 2 mM concentration, a remarkably size-monodisperse
population emerges, with mean hydrodynamic diameter slightly larger
than that measured for ZIF-8 alone. Furthermore, DDM micelles of approximately
9 nm presented in Figure 1a disappear, which suggests that DDM micelles spontaneously
disassemble and adsorb onto ZIF-8 nanocrystals, yielding Glyco-ZIF-8
colloidal suspensions.

To explore the effect of lectin–sugar
affinity on the possibility
of creating supramolecular aggregates, we added Con A to the colloidal
suspension of Glyco-ZIF-8. DLS results of such experiment can be observed
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Hydrodynamic
diameter distribution measured by DLS of Glyco-ZIF-8/Con
A supraparticles for different lectin final concentrations: (a) 0.4
nM Con A (solid line −), 0.4 nM Con A added after addition
of 100 nM d-mannose (dashed line --), (b) 7 nM Con A, and
(c) 11 nM Con A.

It can be clearly observed
from Figure 2a (solid
line) that the addition of Con A
(even at nanomolar concentrations) leads to the formation of self-assembled
Glyco-ZIF-8/Con A supraparticles showing a self-limited growth. Understanding
why and how the self-assembly process occurs in a self-limited fashion
requires a detailed assessment of the driving forces operating between
building blocks.47 In this regard, Kotov
et al. demonstrated that this interesting behavior can be described
in terms of a delicate interplay between repulsive and attractive
forces, i.e., thermodynamically controlled growth reaches a limit
when repulsive interactions between formed supraparticles and nanoprecursors
exceeds the attractive forces leading to formation in the first place.
Different from the commonly used kinetically controlled template-assisted
supraparticle growth, the above-described strategy allows for fine
tuning via environmental variables (e.g., pH, temperature, ionic strength).48,49 This control strategy was tested for the formation of all-inorganic
supraparticles and hybrid supraparticles, where the driving forces
for the assembly were repulsive electrostatic interactions and attractive
van der Waals interactions. Recently, the approach has been extended
for the synthesis of glycoenzyme–lectin self-limited supraparticles
that presented lectin–carbohydrate recognition and electrostatic
interaction as the main attractive and repulsive forces, respectively.50 To evaluate the importance of lectin–carbohydrate
recognition interactions in the Glyco-ZIF-8/Con A supraparticles assembly,
we studied the process in the presence of 100 mM d-mannose,
acting as competing agent for the Con A binding sites (Figure 2a, dashed line). When mannose
is added before Con A, lectin/Glyco-ZIF-8 assembly results were inhibited,
which strongly suggest the crucial role of carbohydrate recognition
for supraparticle formation. An important parameter for the assessment
of further applications of these supraparticles is the association
constant (Ka), which can be expected to
lie in the range of 1 × 107–1 × 109 M–1 based on already reported values for
the affinity between maltose-grafted nanoparticles and Con A protein.51,52 Due to the effect of multivalent recognition, the observed affinity
between maltose-grafted nanoparticles and Con A can be several orders
of magnitude higher than the values observed for interaction between
free maltose and Con A (Ka = 2.1 ×
103 M–1).53

ζ-Potential measurements were carried out to explore
the
effect of surface modifications on ZIF-8 nanocrystals. Figure 3 shows the observed evolution
of surface charge. According to what can be expected from surface
functionalization, after DDM coating, surface charge diminishes due
to partial shielding; further decrease can be observed as Con A is
added to the Glyco-ZIF-8 colloidal suspension forming supraparticles.

Figure 3 ζ
potential measurements of ZIF-8, Glyco-ZIF-8 prepared with
DDM, and Glyco-ZIF-8/Con A supraparticles with a final Con A concentration
of 0.4 nM.

It should be noted that Glyco-ZIF-8
supraparticles remain positively
charged, whereas lectin protein is negatively charged for the conditions
used in the experiments. Because of the presence of oppositely charged
constituents, it would be expected that only attractive (van der Waals,
electrostatic, and biorecognition) forces participate, rendering it
very difficult to achieve a self-limited growth. Nevertheless, we
found that the extent of agglomeration, i.e., the hydrodynamic diameter
and the ζ potential of the supraparticles, strongly depends
on the [Con A]/[Glyco-ZIF-8] ratio (Figures 2 and 3). In particular,
we observed that self-limited and stable colloidal systems were obtained
when the [Con A]/[Glyco-ZIF-8] ratio leads to positively charged supraparticles.
For example, the addition of 0.4 nM Con A resulted in supraparticles
with a ζ-potential value of +20 mV. By increasing Con A concentration,
ζ-potential of the supraparticles decreased while average size
increased (see Figure 2a–c).

Above 11 nM Con A concentration, the resultant
ζ potential
of the supraparticle approaches zero and full agglomeration can be
expected as actually occurred. Similar behavior was observed by other
authors for the self-assembly of positively charged proteins and negatively
charged Au nanoparticles, which was discussed in detail by Moerz et
al. in terms of electrostatic repulsion and van der Waals attractive
interactions.54Scheme 1 shows a representation of recognition-driven
self-assembly as discussed above.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
TEM images confirming
the morphology and size distribution of the colloidal suspensions
measured after DDM functionalization were obtained. Figure 4 displays an example of such
size distributions, and particle size analysis shows a monodisperse
population centered at 83 ± 13 nm diameter.

7 nM Con A addition. (Bottom) Distance between two Glyco-ZIF-8 nanocrystals
in the presence of Con A (left), and size distribution (right) for
the same experiment (7 nM Con A) calculated using the longest distance
between any two points on the supraparticle.

Furthermore, calculated size distributions of Glyco-ZIF-8
after
Con A addition in Figure 4 are bimodal; this result is in line with the presence of
both populations of nanoprecursors and supraparticles, as observed
in DLS (see Figure 2). Another interesting observation that can be extracted from typical
TEM images, such as those presented in Figure 4, is an estimation of the interparticle distance
between Con A-assembled Glyco-ZIF-8 unit, which is in the range of
≈10 nm. Although the ex situ character of TEM measurements
does not allow for a direct comparison with actual values inferred
from DDM and Con A molecular dimensions, both the determined size
of supraparticle assemblies and the interparticle distance in Glyco-ZIF-8
are in line with in situ DLS measurements and agree reasonably well
with the expected values for DDM-Con A spacers, ≈7 nm (see Scheme 1).50,55 To further characterize the chemical composition of DDM-functionalized
ZIF-8 nanocrystals observed by TEM, we performed energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and measured elemental composition (Zn, N,
and O) profile along a transversal direction, as shown in Figure 5. The presence of
Zn and N inside the nanocrystals correlates well with the known chemical
composition of metallic center (Zn) and the linker (2-methylimidazolate)
constituting ZIF-8 structure. It is interesting to note that (although
rather weak due to the number of DDM molecules present on the nanocrystal
surface), in line with DLS and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) experiments,
there is a signal attributable to oxygen, which provides further indication
of DDM surface positioning.

and (right) elemental
line profile along the path shown in TEM image obtained from EDS.

Crystalline Structure via
X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA) Experiments
X-ray diffractograms were carried
out to characterize the crystalline structure of synthesized materials
and to assess its stability toward aqueous environments used in the
supraparticle assembly; Figure 6 summarizes the results obtained. A comparison with calculated
ZIF-8 diffractogram from reported structure is also presented, which
further confirms the presence of the material after the assembly procedure.

Figure 6 X-ray
diffractograms obtained for the as-prepared material, DDM-functionalized
(Glyco-MOF), and Con A-assembled supraparticles (Glyco-MOF + Con A).
In all cases, structures can be safely assumed to retain ZIF-8 characteristic
reflections and thus crystal structure.

Figure 7 allows
for a comparison between the weight loss profiles observed in TGA
experiments for ZIF-8 alone and DDM-functionalized ZIF-8 nanocrystals.
It is expected that when a labile component is present in the structure,
an earlier weight loss would appear (DDM surfactant decomposition);
this was observed in Figure 7 with DDM decomposition between 200 and 300 °C.

profile and its corresponding derivative for ZIF-8
nanocrystals and DDM-functionalized ZIF-8. Earlier weight loss between
200 and 300 °C points toward the presence of DDM, which is not
present in ZIF-8 thermograms.

Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) Experiments
To bring
further support to the proposed lectin–carbohydrate-driven
assembly of Glyco-ZIF-8 units, the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)
technique was used. Initially, mannosylated crystals prepared using
the protocols described in the Experimental Section below were incubated with Con A solution to position a lectin monolayer
on the sensor surface. After rinsing with Milli-Q water and drying
with N2, the Con A adsorption resulted in a frequency decrease
of −18 Hz. Frequency change (Δf) measured
using QCM can be converted to surface mass coverage (Γ) using
the Sauerbrey equation, and the measured value translates to 318 ng/cm2, which is in good agreement with the previously reported
values for Con A layer (ΓConA) formation.56,57 Subsequently, the Con A-modified crystal was incubated in Glyco-ZIF-8
colloidal suspension. Figure 8 shows Δf time evolution during the
assembly of the DDM-functionalized ZIF-8 nanocrystals mediated by
lectin–carbohydrate recognition. A rapid assembly process can
be seen since most of the Glyco-ZIF-8 adsorption occurs in less than
2 min (compared to the time range observed for similar mediated assemblies
of ZIF-8 nanocrystals, which take more than 2 h to reach final stages).20

MOF assembly onto a Con A-modified crystal (left). Frequency change
(Δf) time evolution.

The Glyco-ZIF-8/Con A architecture
showed good stability during
immersion in deionized water. The frequency change between the Glyco-ZIF-8/Con
A-modified crystal and the Con A-modified crystal (both measured in
dry conditions) was −60 Hz, i.e., a ΓMOF of
1060 ng/cm2.

Conclusions
Conditions for stability
and surface functionalization of ZIF-8
MOF nanocrystals using a biocompatible surfactant (DDM) were determined.
As a proof of concept, Glyco-ZIF-8 units thus synthesized (i.e., maltose-exposing
ZIF-8 nanocrystals) were assembled using affinity of lectin protein
Con A toward maltose. The supraparticles obtained display a self-limited
size as a result of lectin–carbohydrate recognition, and accordingly,
the interactions governing the process were found to be not only effective
but also specific (QCM control experiments carried out using ZIF-8
nanocrystals without DDM surface modification were observed to produce
frequency changes nearly an order of magnitude lower than that obtained
using DDM-modified ZIF-8).

Having in mind that ZIF-8 was proven
in the past to possess a number
of interesting features (e.g., its ability to selectively adsorb O2 from aqueous environments, or the possibility of placing
different guest molecules on the available porosity), the hereby presented
possibility of synthesizing Glyco-ZIF-8/Con A self-limited supraparticles
opens the path for a number of interesting applications in the field
of functional nanobiomaterials. With little modifications, the approach
presented can be applied to different recognition-driven systems,
using diverse MOFs and biomolecules.

Experimental Section
Materials
Used, Synthesis, and Procedures
All reagents
were used as supplied by manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich), namely, zinc
nitrate hexahydrate, 2-methylimidazole (HmIm), n-dodecyl
β-d-maltoside (DDM), concanavalin A (Con A) from Canavalia ensiformis (Jack bean), α-d-mannopyranosyl-phenyl-isothiocyanate, cysteamine hydrochloride, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), and d-mannose (Sigma-Aldrich). Gold-coated
quartz crystal QCM substrates were provided by Stanford Research Systems.
DLS and QCM experiments were carried out at 20 °C. A 1 μM
Con A stock solution was prepared in the presence of 100 mM KCl, 20
mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM CaCl2, and 0.5 mM MnCl2.

Glyco-ZIF-8 Synthesis
ZIF-8 nanocrystals were prepared
by mixing aqueous solutions of the precursors. Briefly, 4.5 mL volume
of 50 mM HmIm solution was quickly added to 0.5 mL of 25 mM metal
precursor solution to obtain ZIF-8 nanocrystals colloid after 45–60
min total reaction time. Afterward, 10 mM stock solution of DDM was
used to modify the ZIF-8 colloidal suspension (DDM final concentration
in the mixture, 2 mM) to yield Glyco-MOF nanocrystals.

Synthesis of
Con A/Glyco-MOF Supraparticles
Supraparticles
made of Concanavalin A (Con A) and Glyco-MOF were assembled in aqueous
media by dropwise addition of Con A solution to a colloidal suspension
of Glyco-MOF obtained as stated above and under smooth stirring.

QCM and E-QCM Experiments
QCM measurements were performed
with a QCM200 Quartz Cristal Microbalance equipped with Gold QCM25
5 MHz oscillators (sensitivity factor: 56.6 Hz cm2/μg)
(Stanford Research Systems). Determinations were performed with quiescent
solutions in a Teflon cell. The crystals were cleaned by immersion
into a 1:1:5 volume ratio solution of hydrogen peroxide (30%), ammonia
(25%), and deionized water kept at 75 °C for 5 min. Then, gold
surface was modified with mannose motif as previously reported.50 To study the assembly kinetics, the frequency
was in situ monitored during adsorption of each component (Con A and
ZIF-8 nanocrystals). Moreover, the mass surface coverage (Γ)
was estimated by comparing the frequency before and after the assembly
in dry conditions and assuming that the system can be understood in
terms of Sauerbrey’s model.58

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) Experiments for Size and ζ-Potential
Determination
Hydrodynamic diameters and polydispersity were
determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments using a Malvern
Zetasizer ZS apparatus. We used a 633 nm He–Ne laser and backscattered
detection optic arrangement, i.e., detector placed at 7° with
respect to the incident light beam. All of the measurements were carried
out in 7 mM HEPES pH 7.4 buffer containing 35 mM KCl. ζ potential
measurements were determined from three independent experiments to
ensure reproducibility, using capillary cells (Malvern Instruments)
with a drive cell voltage of 30 V. For the ζ potential calculations,
the Smoluchowski approximation of the Henry equation was employed.

TEM and EDS
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images were obtained with a JEM 1200 EX II (JEOL Ltd.) equipped with
a digital camera Erlangshen ES1000 W, model 785 (Gatan Inc.). The
samples were observed under an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Energy-dispersive
spectrum (EDS) mapping was carried out using a Talos TEM (FEI; Talos
F200X 80–200). Size distributions and image analysis were carried
out using BioImageXD software.59

Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
Thermogravimetric
analysis was carried out using TGA Q500 (TA Instruments), with a N2 flow of 20 mL/min, at 5 °C/min heating rate with Pt
pans.

X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Calculated X-ray diffraction
patterns were obtained from Cambridge Crystallographic Data Base ZIF-8
files using Mercury software.60 Diffraction
experiments on the synthesized materials were recorded at room temperature
under ambient conditions on a Phillips X’Pert-1 diffractometer.
