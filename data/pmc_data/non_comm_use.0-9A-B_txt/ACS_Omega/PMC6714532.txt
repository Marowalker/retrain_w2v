Chronic
inflammation and progressive bone damage in joints are
two main pathological features of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We have
synthesized a gold cluster with glutathione (Au29SG27) (named GA) that can effectively suppress both inflammation
and bone damage in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. Thus,
gold clusters showed great potential for the therapy of RA. However,
the optimal therapeutic dose remaining has to be determined. Therapeutic
effect and safety are largely relying on drug dosage. Specifying the
dose-dependent effects of GA on both therapy and biosafety can facilitate
its clinical transformation research. Therefore, in this study, we
comprehensively evaluated the dose-dependent efficacy of GA on the
30-day toxicity and RA treatment in rats. Results showed that continuous
intraperitoneal injection of GA at a dose of 15 mg/kg (Au content)
for 30 days resulted in slight hematological abnormalities and increases
on organ coefficients of kidney and adrenal gland, while 10 mg Au/kg
did not cause any obvious toxicity and side effects. In the treatment
of CIA rats, only when the dose of GA reached 5 mg Au/kg, the symptoms
of RA could be significantly improved. With regard to the histopathological
analysis, although a lower dose of GA can suppress inflammation and
bone damage to some extent, only the 5 mg Au/kg treatment could restore
them to a state close to the normal control group. Therefore, we infer
that 5 mg Au/kg is the optimal dose of GA for RA therapy in rats,
which provides a theoretical basis for further preclinical research.

Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the
most common autoimmune
and chronic inflammatory diseases, afflicts about 0.5 to 1% of the
world’s population.1,2 Chronic synovial inflammation
and progressive cartilage/bone destruction in joints are two major
pathologic features of RA.2 Bone erosion
is the major cause of disability that severely reduces the life quality
of patients, carrying a tremendous burden for both the individual
and society.1,3 Despite that a therapeutic revolution
for RA treatment in the past decade has improved the disease outcomes,
there is still many patients who do not respond to current therapies
or do not benefit from them due to severe side effects.1 Especially, there is still no established effective
therapeutics for preventing joint damage in the long term.4 Therefore, the design of novel therapy strategies
to suppress inflammation and reduce joint destruction simultaneously
is urgently required.

Chrysotherapy has been used to treat RA
patients for more than
70 years and was considered as an important disease-modifying antirheumatic
drug (DMARDs) with well-documented anti-inflammatory activity.5−7 Moreover, some monovalent gold drugs showed potential activity on
bone metabolism in vitro.8 However, the non-negligible high toxicity and adverse side effects
of these gold drugs led to discontinuation in up to 45% of treated
patients, which resulted in a dramatic decline of chrysotherapy use
in RA clinical practice.5,9,10 Therefore, more studies are needed to develop novel gold drugs with
higher activity and minimal side effects.

In recent years, Au
clusters (especially the peptide-templated
Au clusters) have attracted much attention for their excellent biocompatibilities
and intrinsic biomedical activities.11−14 The ease of synthesis and the
unique biological properties of peptide-templated Au clusters make
them ideal candidates for translation from the laboratory to the clinical
use in humans.11,15

In a previous study, we
have proven a peptide-templated Au cluster
named GA (Au29SG27), which is synthesized with
glutathione as the thiolate ligand and seems to be a very promising
anti-arthritic formulation in RA management.16 The Au cluster could effectively diminish the inflammation symptoms
and prevent joint damage in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats,
without any obvious side effects.16 It
is worth noting that the Au cluster showed more efficacy in bone protection
than the clinical anchor drug for RA therapy, methotrexate. As a result,
the Au cluster may provide an alternative to traditional antirheumatic
drugs with more effectiveness and safety.16,17

Efficacy and safety are two of the most critical concerns
in drug
development, and there is a balance between them.18,19 The objective of this study is to identify the optimal dose of GA,
which effectively suppresses inflammation and bone damage in CIA rats,
without any toxicity and side effects. The results reported in this
work will be helpful to understand the not yet complete clarified
toxicological and pharmacodynamic effects of gold clusters and facilitate
their clinical use in the future.

Results
Synthesis and
Characterization of Au Clusters
The Au
cluster was synthesized by using HAuCl4 and glutathione
(GSH) as we reported previously.16 The
GSH tripeptide was used as a thiolate ligand to anchor the produced
Au clusters via strong Au–S bonds in aqueous solution, under
mild conditions. The purified Au cluster was named GA and has excellent
water solubility, and the aqueous solution showed a light yellow color.
When excited by UV light, the solution containing GA emitted a strong
red fluorescence (Figure 1A). The peaks of the excitation and the emission spectra are
located at 380 and 602 nm, respectively, consistent with our previous
reports (Figure 1B).
The precise molecular formula and structure of the Au cluster have
been determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and density
functional theory calculations in our previous study, which can be
expressed as Au29SG27.16

Dose-Dependent Toxicity of GA in Normal Rats
The decline
in the clinical use of traditional gold drugs was due to serious side
effects, which mainly include hematological toxicities (leukopenia,
thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia) and organ damage (pulmonary,
hepatitis, and kidney).5 Therefore, biosafety
of the Au cluster is our main concern in this study. Preliminarily,
a 30-day toxicity assessment of the Au cluster was conducted. We found
that the half lethal dose (LD50) of GA injected intraperitoneally
in SD rats was 288.9 ± 13 mg Au/kg.16 According to the standard methods for measuring chronic toxicity,
we choose a dose of 15 mg Au/kg as the initial assessment dose, which
is about 1/20 of the LD50. Simultaneously, a higher dose
of 20 mg Au/kg and a lower dose of 10 mg Au/kg were chosen to assess.
A control group was also set by injecting an equal volume of saline.
The indicated doses of GA were intraperitoneally injected to normal
male SD rats every 2 days for 30 days. In the 20 mg Au/kg treated
group, one rat died after the third injection, so this dose was totally
abolished. At the end of the 30-day administrate, all treated rats
showed comparable body weight gains with the control group. The changes
in blood parameters and organ coefficient as well as the histopathological
changes of main organs were systemically evaluated. First, a routine
hematological examination were performed, and the results indicated
no significant difference in the hematological index compared with
control rats after the treatment with 10 mg Au/kg of GA, but the 15
mg Au/kg treatment induced increases in the percentage of Gran (Gran%)
and hematocrit (HCT) and decreases in the number and the percentage
of Mid (Mid# and Mid%), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration
(MCHC), and thrombocytocrit (PCT) (Table 1). In the serum biochemistry assays, no obvious
change occurred in either 10 or 15 mg Au/kg GA-treated rats, compared
with the control group (Table 2). Then, organ coefficients, including heart, liver, spleen,
lung, kidney, testis, adrenal gland, and thymus, were calculated.
Results indicated that the 15 mg Au/kg treatment increased the coefficients
of the kidney and adrenal gland, while 10 mg Au/kg did not cause any
significant changes in all detected organs (Table 3). Next, these organs were sectioned and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. No
notable pathological abnormalities were found in either 10 or 15 mg
Au/kg treated rats (Figure 2). These results indicate that 15 mg Au/kg of GA will induce
slight toxicity to normal rats, especially considering some hematological
index and organ coefficients, while 10 mg Au/kg of GA did not cause
any unexpected side effects.

Dose-Dependent
Therapeutic Effect of GA in Collagen-Induced
Arthritis Model
To determine the optimal dose of GA for RA
therapy in rats, a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, the most
commonly used model for RA therapeutic evaluation, was used in this
study.20,21 On the basis of the 30-day toxicity assessment
of the Au cluster, we chose 0.5 mg Au/kg (1/20 of 10 mg Au/kg) as
the initial treatment dose and then gradiently increased to 5 mg Au/kg
per day. After the RA model was completely established (day 22 post
primary collagen immunization), rats were injected every day with
0.5–5 mg Au/kg of GA (0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mg Au/kg) for 42 days
and compared with saline-treated CIA rats. Non-immunized rats injected
intraperitoneally with an equal volume of saline were served as the
normal control. The change of body weight in each group was monitored
during the whole course of treatment. Data revealed that CIA decreased
the body weight of normal rats, but GA treatment did not further aggravate
this reduction in all dose groups (Figure 3A). During the test, swelling of the joints
was assessed by measuring the ankle circumference of each rat every
week, and the clinic arthritis index was scored (0–4 point)
according to clinical observation. Statistics on mean ankle circumference
suggest that the swelling of the joints was induced by CIA and sustained
for the whole time after the model was established (Figure 3B). Among the GA-treated groups,
only the dose of 5 mg Au/kg significantly alleviated the swelling
from the fourth week, while other low doses slightly improved symptoms
without statistical significance (Figure 3B). The clinical score on arthritis showed
similar results to the mean ankle circumference evaluation. Only 5
mg Au/kg of GA significantly remitted the swelling and tenderness
compared with the model group from the third week (Figure 3C). Other low doses of GA did
not significantly improve the clinical symptoms of arthritis (Figure 3C). Representative
photographs of the hind claws of each group at the beginning, middle,
and end of administration were shown in Figure 3D, which provides visible evidence for the
therapeutic effect of GA.

Dose-Dependent Efficacy of GA on Inflammation Suppression in
CIA Rats
Subsequently, histopathological sections of hind
claws were assessed after the rats were sacrificed to evaluate the
inflammation within periarticular soft tissues and synovial tissues.
Histopathological observation indicated that CIA induced obvious synovium
hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration around the rheumatic
joints (Figure 4A).
Both 2.5 and 5 mg Au/kg of GA can attenuate the synovial inflammation
effectively, but not the lower doses (Figure 4A). Statistics of histology score supported
the observation judgment that 2.5 mg Au/kg (p <
0.05) and 5 mg Au/kg (p < 0.01) of GA significantly
suppress the CIA-induced synovial inflammation, while the lower doses
did not (Figure 4B).
The chronic inflammation of RA was mainly conducted by sustained high
levels of proinflammatory factors, including TNF-α, IL-1β,
and IL-6. The effect of GA on these biochemical parameters in the
serum of CIA rats was determined by radioimmunoassay. Results showed
that CIA increased all of these cytokines in serum, while GA treatments
reduced this increase in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). According to the significant
examination, only 2.5 mg Au/kg (p < 0.05) and
5 mg Au/kg (p < 0.01) of GA could significantly
inhibit the upregulation of all three proinflammatory factors, which
is consistent with the histopathological observation.

Dose-Dependent Efficacy
of GA on Bone Destruction Prevention
in CIA Rats
The most deleterious effect caused by RA is bone
erosion in joints. The effect of GA on the progression of cartilage/bone
destruction was evaluated by histopathological analysis and microCT
scan on the ends of metatarsal. Histopathological observations within
joints showed that the CIA model induces serious damage in both cartilage
and bone, while the higher doses of GA treatment could attenuate the
erosion obviously (Figure 4A). Histological score analysis of cartilage and bone damage
showed that exceeding 1 mg Au/kg of GA could significantly prevent
CIA-induced cartilage/bone erosion in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4B). Results of microCT
analysis also revealed that CIA induced very serious damage to articular
bones and caused many bone resorption pits and holes in joints, while
higher doses of GA treatment could effectively attenuate this destruction
(Figure 5A). Most noteworthy,
the 5 mg Au/kg GA treatment almost restored the bone damage to the
normal state, while the lower dose groups still had some erosion pits
(Figure 5A). Bone mineral
density (BMD) analysis, consistent with the microCT observations,
showed that only 5 mg Au/kg of GA can attenuate the CIA-induced bone
loss to a significant extent.

group (n = 5 per group) of CIA mice treated with

erosion is marked by the dotted box (pit) and dotted circle (cavity).

At the end of treatments, histopathological
changes in the main
organs of CIA rats were examined to determine whether any damage was
induced by GA treatment. The observation indicated that the 42-day
continuous administration of GA did not induce any noticeable damage
to organs in CIA rats at these doses (Figure 6). These results suggested that, considering
the anti-inflammatory and osteoprotective activity as well as the
biosafety in the treatment of RA, 5 mg Au/kg of GA is the optimal
dose in rats.

Discussion
Rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) is characterized by the presence of inflammatory
synovitis and progressive cartilage/bone destruction, but the pathogenesis
is still not completely understood.1 Joint
destruction is the most severe outcome of this disease and the major
cause of disability.3 Conventional DMARDs
usually aim to inhibit the inflammation, and very few treatments aim
to improve RA-associated bone loss.3,20 Although the
prospects for most patients are currently favorable, a large number
of patients are still suffering from severe dysfunction in arthritic
joints.1 Among conventional DMARDs, gold
drugs appear to be very potent inhibitors of inflammation and showed
some potential influences on bone metabolism in vitro.6,8 However, the serious side effects of gold drugs lead
to a decline of clinical applications in recent years.5,22 Therefore, more research is needed to develop innovative gold drugs,
which not only retain the activity of chrysotherapy but also have
minimal side effects.

In recent years, several studies have
reported that nonmodified
gold nanoparticles exhibit potential RA therapeutic activity in CIA
rats without serious toxicity and side effects.23−26 For example, prophylactic intra-articular
treatment with 13 or 50 nM gold nanoparticles in the early stage of
arthritis can significantly inhibit joint swelling and cartilage erosion.23,26 In established arthritis of rats, continuous intra-articular treatment
of these two nanoparticles can also effectively ameliorate the symptoms.24 However, this local injection is not conducive
to a comprehensive assessment of its biosafety. In another study,
continuous intraperitoneal injection of gold particles about 15 nM
in diameter showed effective anti-arthritis activity in CIA rat models,
but its biosafety was not assessed in this study.25 In addition, the mechanisms of the anti-arthritis activity
of these gold nanoparticles are still not very clear. In these studies,
the beneficial response of gold nanoparticles was attributed to the
suppression of inflammatory mediators and inhibition of VEGF (vascular
endothelial growth factor) or antioxidant properties.23−26

As novel gold nanomaterials, gold clusters synthesized with
biomolecules
(especially for peptides) have attracted much attention for their
excellent biocompatibilities and synergistic biomedical properties.11,12 We have prepared a Au cluster composed of 29 gold atoms and 27 GSH
peptides in each molecule, named GA (Au29SG27).16 The LD50 of GA injected
intraperitoneally in SD rats was nearly 39 times higher than that
of auranofin.7,16 In a previous study, we found
that the gold cluster could markedly inhibit RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis
and LPS-induced proinflammatory secretion in vitro and attenuate arthritis and bone destruction in a CIA rat model.16 In CIA rats, the cluster exhibits similar anti-inflammatory
activity to methotrexate, the first-line clinical anchored antirheumatic
drug, and is superior to methotrexate in preventing cartilage/bone
destruction.16,27 Therefore, peptide-protected
gold clusters have shown fine therapeutic activity for RA in preclinical
studies and revealed great potential for future clinical applications.

The efficacy and safety of drugs are closely related to dosage,
which is a very crucial issue in clinical transformation research.19,28 Therefore, the dose-dependent efficacy of the GA cluster on RA therapy
and biosafety was comprehensively assessed in this study. We found
that continuous intraperitoneal administration of 20 mg Au/kg of GA
resulted in individual animal death, but 15 and 10 mg Au/kg did not.
However, compared with saline-treated rats, 15 mg Au/kg of GA induced
several changes in hematological parameters (Gran%, HCT, Mid%, MCHC,
and PCT) and organ coefficients (kidney and adrenal gland) during
a 30-day toxicity assessment, while 10 mg Au/kg of GA did not induce
any significant toxicity and side effects. Despite the slight increase
in renal organ index induced by 15 mg Au/kg of GA, no obvious pathological
damage was observed from histopathology observations. Considering
the tissue distribution of Au after the GA treatment reported previously,
gold is highly distributed in the kidney.16 Therefore, we speculate that this phenomenon is caused by the accumulation
of gold. These data indicate that the continuous administration of
GA at doses below 10 mg Au/kg will be safe in vivo of rats. Then, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of a series
of doses of GA in a rat RA model, including 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mg
Au/kg, to determine the lowest dose that can significantly suppress
both inflammation and bone damage. Results showed that there is a
dose-dependent therapeutic effect of GA in this range. Assessments
on joint circumference and clinic arthritis score showed that only
5 mg Au/kg of GA could significantly improve RA symptoms. This conclusion
was further proved by histopathological examination and microCT analysis.
These data showed that 1 mg Au/kg of GA can significantly inhibit
inflammation but not obviously suppress cartilage/bone destruction.
Although 2.5 mg Au/kg of GA could significantly suppress both inflammation
and bone damage, only 5 mg Au/kg of GA could restore the joint state
to near normal control. Detection of proinflammatory factors in the
serum also showed that 5 mg Au/kg of GA had the highest activity in
suppressing inflammation. A previous study proved that the bone destruction
in RA was initiated by several pro-inflammatory cytokines produced
by macrophages, such as TNF-α and IL-1β.29 These cytokines increase the expression of receptor activator
of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) to promote the differentiation
of bone-resorbing osteoclasts.6,30 In a previous study,
we found that the gold clusters not only inhibited the overexpression
of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages but also
directly inhibited the differentiation of osteoclasts induced by RANKL in vitro.16 In this study, lower
doses of GA showed significant improvement in bone damage, but not
in inflammation suppression, such as the dose of 1 mg Au/kg. These
results suggest that GA not only protects the bone by inhibiting inflammation
but also plays a direct role in preventing bone destruction. Furthermore,
5 mg Au/kg GA treatment for 42 days did not induce a significant influence
on the gain of body weight and the histopathology of main organs in
CIA rats, which indicated its high biosafety. Therefore, we conclude
that the dose of 5 mg Au/kg is the optimal dose of GA for RA therapy
in rats. We hope that this study could facilitate the clinical transformation
of such active gold clusters in the near future.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Glutathione (GSH = γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) and
HAuCl4·3H2O were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(USA). Bovine type II collagen and incomplete Freund’s adjuvant
were purchased from Chondrex, Inc. (USA). All Sprague–Dawley
(SD) rats were purchased from Hua Fukang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing,
China). Deionized water of Milli-Q purity grade (18.2 MΩ·cm)
was obtained with a Milli-Q water system (USA).

Synthesis and
Characterization of Au29SG27 Clusters
The Au29SG27 clusters were
synthesized and purified according to a previously reported method.16,31 In brief, an equal volume of freshly prepared 30 mM GSH aqueous
solution and 20 mM HAuCl4 aqueous solution were mixed under gentle
stirring (500 rpm) for 10 min at 25 °C. Next, the reaction mixture
was heated to 70 °C for 12 h under mild stirring (500 rpm) and
then kept at room temperature for another 12 h in the dark. Subsequently,
the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min to remove
the precipitated large particles and then purified by adding a 3-fold
volume of ethanol to the as-synthesized clusters. The solution was
fully mixed and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min to discard the
supernatant containing free GSH and gold ions. Retained precipitation
was washed three times with 75% ethanol. Purified clusters were re-dissolved
in ultrapure water with the assistance of sodium hydroxide. The solution
was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min to remove the insoluble components.
The cluster solution was further purified using an ultrafiltration
tube (Millipore, MWCO: 3 kDa) to remove the free ions. The fluorescence
spectrum of purified clusters was detected to verify the products
by using an RF-5301 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).
An aliquot of purified cluster was detected by inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (Thermo Elemental X7) to quantify the Au
content, and the rest was sealed and stored in the dark at 4 °C.

Toxicity Assessment
Twenty male SD rats with an average
body weight of 200 g were randomly assigned to four groups, each consisting
of five animals: control group, saline injected; low dose group, 10
mg Au/kg of GA injected; medium dose group, 15 mg Au/kg of GA injected;
and high dose group, 20 mg Au/kg of GA injected. All groups were intraperitoneally
injected with corresponding drugs every 2 days for 30 days. The rats
were given food and water freely during the experimental procedures.
The body weight of each mouse was closely monitored every week. At
the end of the treatment, blood sample was collected from each rat
for hematological and biochemical analyses. The major organs, including
heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, testis, adrenal gland, and thymus,
were harvested after the rats were sacrificed and weighed following
their dissection. Then, these organs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin, embedded into paraffin routinely, and sectioned to 8 μm
slices. The obtained slices were stained for histopathological examination
by using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and analyzed under a microscope.
All animal care and experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Ethic Committee at the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(approved no. SYXK (jing) 2014-0023).

Collagen-Induced Arthritis
(CIA) Model and Treatment Protocols
All animal care and experiments
were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Ethic Committee at the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(approved no. SYXK (jing) 2014-0023) and carried out in accordance
with the National Act on the use of experimental animals (China).
Native bovine type II collagen was dissolved in 0.1 mM acetic acid
at 4 °C overnight, and the immune emulsion (2 mg/mL) was prepared
by emulsifying with an equal volume of Complete Freund’s Adjuvant.
Five- to 6-week-old SD male rats (180–200 g) were subcutaneously
injected at the base of the tail with 0.2 mL of the emulsion containing
400 μg of type II collagen. Seven days after the primary immunization,
rats were boosted subcutaneously with 200 μg of type II collagen
immune emulsion once again. Rats were closely monitored for arthritis
disease progression by assessing ankle circumference and clinical
arthritis score. The clinical arthritis score of each paw was assessed
by using semiquantitative scoring of five grades (0–4) according
to the degree of erythema and swelling: 0 = no erythema or swelling;
1 = slight erythema or swelling of one toe or finger; 2 = erythema
and swelling on more than one toe or finger; 3 = erythema and swelling
of ankle or wrist; and 4 = complete erythema and swelling of toes
or fingers and ankles or wrists.32 Every
claw was graded, and a mean score was calculated for each animal.
At day 21 after the first immunization, the rats with clinical scores
of 3 and 4 were randomly assigned to five groups to initiate the treatment,
each group contained five rats: group I, saline-treated CIA rats;
group II, CIA rats treated with 0.5 mg Au/kg/day of GA; group III,
CIA rats treated with 1 mg Au/kg/day of GA; group IV, CIA rats treated
with 2.5 mg Au/kg/day of GA; and group V, CIA rats treated with 5
mg Au/kg/day of GA. Five saline-treated non-immunized rats served
as a normal control. Saline and GA dissolved in saline were intraperitoneally
injected once a day and continuously administered for 6 weeks (42
days). During the treatment period, ankle circumference and clinical
arthritis score as well as the body weight of each rat were measured
every week. At the end of the treatment, blood sample of each rat
was collected and centrifuged to obtain the serum for conducting proinflammatory
cytokine detection. The concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β,
and IL-6 in the serum were determined by radioimmunoassay in Fraser
Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Then, rats were sacrificed
by excess CO2 inhalation, and the hind limbs of each rat were harvested
for three-dimensional microfocus computed tomography (microCT) analysis
and histopathological examination. The major organs including the
brain, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, testis, adrenal gland, and thymus
were dissected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathological
examination.

MicroCT Analyses and Histopathological Analysis
The
hind limb of each rat was harvested after sacrifice and analyzed with
microCT (IVIS Spectrum CT, Perkin Elmer, USA) at a voltage of 90 kV
and an electric current of 88 μA. The scan mode is high resolution,
and the scanning resolution is about 72 μM. The bone mineral
density (BMD) was analyzed using AccuCT software (Perkin Elmer, USA).
For histopathological analysis, hind paws were fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin and decalcified in 5% formic acid, embedded in paraffin,
sectioned to ∼5 μm-thick slices, and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin. Histopathological changes in periarticular tissue, synovium,
cartilage, and bone were described and scored by using semiquantitative
scoring of four grades (0–3) according to the severity. Major
organs were also isolated and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin,
embedded in paraffin, sectioned to 5 μm-thick slices, and stained
with HE for histopathological examination.

Statistical Analyses
Statistical analysis was carried
out by using SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS, USA). Data are described as
mean ± standard deviation (SD). Data were first tested for homogeneity
of variance by using Levene’s test. Statistical significance
of overall differences between multiple groups was assessed by one-way
ANOVA, and p < 0.05 was regarded as significant.
