A mechanical route using a grinding
apparatus such as a planetary
ball mill is a simple and scalable method to produce powder materials.
However, the control of the particle shapes is difficult. In this
paper, we report a wet mechanical process in water to synthesize NH4MnPO4·H2O (AmMnP) with various
shapes (plates, flakes, rods, and nanoparticles). This process involves
planetary ball milling of inexpensive raw materials (NH4H2PO4 and MnCO3) at room temperature.
Morphology-controlled AmMnP particles can be obtained by only adjusting
the milling conditions such as milling time, ball size, and centrifugal
acceleration. Furthermore, the conversion of AmMnP into LiMnPO4 with two different approaches (solid-state and hydrothermal
reactions) has been investigated to evaluate its future applicability
as a cathode for lithium-ion batteries. As a particle synthesis with
a unique morphology can be attained based on a dissolution–precipitation
mechanism in a solution via a suitable combination of raw materials,
the study results will promote wet mechanical processes to be widely
used as classic but advanced particle synthesis method.

1 Introduction
Ammonium
transition metal phosphates, NH4MePO4·H2O (AmMeP, Me2+ = Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu),
have been widely employed in industrial applications such as fertilizers,
pigments, and fire-retardants for a long time.1−3 These constituent
elements are an indispensable component for plant growth. Because
AmMeP with its layered crystal structure can exhibit ion channels,4 recent scientific interest in these materials
is toward their functional applications such as supercapacitors and
magnetic materials.5−8 The tuning of the constituent metal elements, including a replacement
of the NH4+ ions by other monovalent cations,
can lead to unique redox reactions. The resulting materials potentially
exhibit superior electrochemical performances.

Another important
application of AmMeP compounds is as a precursor
for the preparation of olivine-type cathodes (e.g., LiFePO4, LiMnPO4 (LMP), LiCoPO4, NaMnPO4) for lithium/sodium-ion batteries.9−14 The topology of the metal phosphate layer in the ac plane of AmMeP matches that in the bc plane of
olivine-type LiMePO4.15 Therefore,
morphology-controlled LiMePO4 and NaMePO4 cathodes
can be prepared through ion-exchange or calcination reactions. Most
approaches for the synthesis of AmMeP particles are based on a precipitation
method from aqueous solutions, reported by Bassett and Bedwell in
1933.16 Zeng et al. developed a general
method to prepare multinary metal ammonium phosphate microspheres
constructed with nanoflakes grown via a hydrothermal (HT) treatment.17 The crystal growth of AmMeP in a solution tends
to form two-dimensional shapes such as sheets, plates, and flakes
owing to the layered crystal structure. In the solution-based synthesis
methods, concentrated or strongly basic solutions are often used for
the control of the pH value and precipitation of products. Following
the increasing demand for environmental-friendly particle synthesis,
a milder preparation route using acid–base reactions between
solids at low temperatures was reported by Yuan et al.18,19 However, the aging time of the mixed powder must cover minimum 12
h because of the slow ion diffusion at the interface.20 Moreover, the solid-state (SS) synthesis restricts the
shape control of particles compared with a solution synthesis. The
development of a scalable, environmental-friendly, and low-cost synthesis
method for morphology-controlled AmMeP particles is crucial not only
for the conversion application for olivine-type cathodes but also
for the acquirement of a new synthesis strategy for functional particles.

In this paper, we report a wet mechanical process in water to synthesize
NH4MnPO4·H2O (AmMnP) particles
with various shapes (plates, flakes, rods, and nanoparticles) using
inexpensive raw materials (NH4H2PO4 and MnCO3). We used a planetary ball mill to effectively
prepare products by grinding the raw materials, dissolving them in
water, and forcing their precipitation in the solution. Despite the
milling process, morphology-controlled AmMnP particles can be obtained
by adjusting the milling time, ball size, and centrifugal acceleration.
The formation mechanism of AmMnP particles via ball milling is discussed
based on a dissolution–precipitation mechanism. The advantages
brought by a wet mechanical process are mainly that reaction processes
from grinding, mixing, and dissolution of starting powders in a solution
to precipitation of products are achieved in one step, that fine particles
can be obtained while dispersing in a solution, and that a nonequilibrium
reaction may occur locally, allowing the formation of metastable materials.
Achieving the morphology control of particles by a physical approach
such as ball milling in a solution may lead to breakthroughs in particle
synthesis of advanced materials. Furthermore, we investigated the
conversion reaction of AmMnP into LiMnPO4 with two different
approaches, i.e., solid-state and hydrothermal reactions, to evaluate
the inheritance of the particle shape and particle growth through
the conversion process.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization of AmMnP via
Wet Mechanical Process
The planetary ball milling of NH4H2PO4 and MnCO3 in water
was carried out to prepare AmMnP (Figure 1a). Under 10 G and with ϕ = 2 mm balls,
AmMnP was easily obtained even after a short milling time of 0.25
h (15 min). The diffraction peak intensity of MnCO3 decreased
with increasing milling time (Figure 1a, inset). A single-phase AmMnP powder was obtained
after milling for 3 h. The tiny diffraction peak at around 8°
is due to a Kβ line of the strongest (010) diffraction of AmMnP.
The unknown peak at around 12° was detected at the initial stage
but almost disappeared after milling for 1 h. Compared with the traditional
room-temperature mixing methods,19,20 the formation
efficiency and crystallinity of AmMnP were improved. It is noted that
NH4H2PO4 is soluble in water, whereas
MnCO3 is insoluble. Though we tested other manganese sources
as raw materials, AmMnP was not formed. Soluble manganese sources
such as MnSO4 and Mn(NO3)2 hydrates
resulted in no precipitates, whereas insoluble MnO2 still
remained after milling. The formation mechanism of AmMnP in water
from a combination of NH4H2PO4 and
MnCO3 is discussed later.

infrared (FT-IR) spectrum and (c) thermogravimetry–differential
thermal analysis (TG–DTA) curves of synthesized AmMnP powder
(milling time, 5 h).

To characterize the AmMnP powder synthesized in the wet mechanical
process, FT-IR and TG–DTA measurements were carried out. Figure 1b shows the FT-IR
spectrum of the product obtained via milling at 10 G with ϕ
= 2 mm balls for 5 h. The band at 3430 cm–1 corresponded
to the O–H stretching vibration of hydrated water molecules,
whereas the peak of the bending mode of the O–H group is located
at 1637 cm–1. The broad bands below 3235 cm–1 and the bands in the 1400–1500 cm–1 region were attributed to the N–H stretches and N–H
bending mode of NH4+, respectively. The sharp
bands in the region below 1150 cm–1 corresponded
to both the vibrations of PO43– and librations
of water. All detected bands matched with reported data.21Figure 1c shows the TG–DTA curves of the AmMnP powder. The
TG curve recorded two-step weight losses with a steep region from
150 to 250 °C and a gradual region up to 550 °C. The weight
losses at these steps were 18.4 and 4.6%, respectively. The thermal
decomposition of AmMnP consists of the co-elimination process of NH3 and H2O and the subsequent dehydration condensation.22 1   2  These decomposition steps lead to weight losses
of 18.9 and 6.0%, respectively. The observed values were close to
the theoretical values. We confirm that the thermally treated products
at 300 and 500 °C for 1 h were amorphous MnHPO4 and
crystalline Mn2P2O7, respectively
(Figure S1). Consequently, AmMnP is first
decomposed to amorphous MnHPO4 phase with an endothermic
reaction and is then crystallized to Mn2P2O7.

2.2 Particle Shape Changes through Milling
We investigated the relation between the particle shapes of AmMnP
and the milling conditions including centrifugal accelerations, times,
and ball sizes. Figure 2 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the AmMnP
powders synthesized at 50 G for 2 h with different ball diameters
(ϕ = 1–5 mm). The use of the smallest balls with ϕ
= 1 mm produced nanoparticles with sizes below 100 nm. In contrast,
rod-like particles, having a length of a few hundred nanometers to
more than 1 μm, were obtained using larger balls of more than
ϕ = 2 mm. The morphology of these products was the same (Figure 2b–d). The
formed rod-like AmMnP particles possessed a gnarled surface and consisted
of bundles.

Figure 2 SEM images of AmMnP powders obtained via milling at 50 G for 2
h with (a) ϕ = 1 mm, (b) ϕ = 2 mm, (c) ϕ = 3 mm,
and (d) ϕ = 5 mm balls.

A further widespread synthesis under milling conditions of
10–50
G for 1–5 h with ϕ = 2 and 5 mm revealed the formation
of AmMnP with various particle shapes (Figures S2 and S3). Based on the SEM observations, we could create
a particle shape diagram. Figure 3 presents the particle shape diagram of AmMnP produced
via the wet mechanical process using balls of ϕ = 2 and 5 mm.
In the case of ϕ = 2 mm, AmMnP particles with plate/flake shapes
were formed under relatively mild milling conditions at a low centrifugal
acceleration for a short time. Rod-like particles and nanoparticles
were obtained by milling at a higher centrifugal acceleration and
for a longer time, respectively. By using ϕ = 5 mm balls, the
formation region of AmMnP with plate/flake and rod shapes expanded.
Further, AmMnP nanoparticles did not form for milling under 50 G for
5 h. The changing particle shapes from plates to rods during the milling
could be observed for products treated with 20 G with ϕ = 5
mm balls. Figure 4a–c
shows the SEM images of the AmMnP plates obtained for 1–5 h.
The (010) plane of AmMnP was well developed owing to the layered structure.
However, the surface of the AmMnP plates became rough with increasing
milling time. These plate particles were segmented (like needle ice)
from edges during the collisions with balls. The later collected segments
exhibited rod shapes. As shown in Figure 2, the use of smaller balls resulted in the
formation of nanoparticles. In general, the collision frequency of
smaller ball sizes is larger than that of bigger balls. When rod particles
receive further mechanical actions via smaller ball sizes or excessive
milling, the rod particles will be ground to nanoparticles (Figure 4d). From these results,
the mechanism for the change of particle morphology of AmMnP at different
milling conditions can be summarized as follows: first, reflecting
the layered crystal structure, relatively mild milling conditions
at a low centrifugal acceleration for a short time or the use of bigger
balls form AmMnP particles with plate/flake shapes. This is probably
because the subsequent grinding step after particle formation does
not occur yet; second, AmMnP particles formed with two-dimensional
morphologies receive a mechanical force with increasing centrifugal
acceleration and milling time, resulting in a one-dimensional rod
shape. The use of smaller balls is also effective in reducing the
particle size. Lastly, relatively severe milling conditions at a high
centrifugal acceleration for a long time bring nanoparticles without
a specific morphology. Therefore, the formation of AmMnP particles
through the wet mechanical process provides shape changes from two-dimensional
particles such as plates and flakes to nanoparticles via the grinding
of one-dimensional rod particles.

= 2 and 5 mm balls.

obtained via milling at 20 G with ϕ
= 5 mm balls for (a) 1 h, (b) 3 h, and (c) 5 h. (d) Schematic illustration
of particle shape change of AmMnP through milling.

To evaluate the grinding behavior after the formation
of AmMnP,
we analyzed the specific surface area of the products. Figure 5 shows the specific surface
areas of the products obtained by milling for 3 and 5 h with balls
of ϕ = 2 and 5 mm. As explained above, the use of smaller balls
with ϕ = 2 mm promotes the grinding of the powder, resulting
in an increase in the specific surface area. The equivalent particle
size can be calculated from the specific surface area (Sw): dBET = 6/(ρ·Sw), where ρ is the theoretical density
(2.49 g/cm3). The AmMnP particle size of 116 nm at 10 G
was reduced to 67 nm after milling at 50 G for 5 h. A different grinding
behavior was observed for the ϕ = 5 mm balls. Although the specific
surface area increased with increasing centrifugal acceleration, it
showed signs of leveling off at approximately 30 m2/g (80
nm). As shown in Figure 3, the rod shape of the products was maintained. The origin of this
behavior can be that the formed rod particles can flow in a relatively
large interspace between balls in the solution. By adjusting the milling
conditions (centrifugal acceleration, time, and ball size), the synthesis
of morphology-controlled AmMnP powders despite a milling process was
achieved. Meanwhile, the thermal property did not depend on the particle
shape of AmMnP. Although the TG curve shown in Figure 1c was recorded with AmMnP plates, the rod-like
particles and nanoparticles exhibited almost the same weight loss
behavior except for a low-temperature shift slightly at nanoparticles
(Figure S4).

mm balls.

2.3 Formation
Mechanism of AmMnP
The
formation of AmMnP in the NH4H2PO4 solution was achieved using MnCO3 as the manganese source;
MnCO3 is insoluble in water (6.5 mg/100 mL) but slightly
soluble in an acid solution. The initial approximate pH value of 4.1
for the NH4H2PO4-dissolved solution
is a key factor for the dissolution of MnCO3 and subsequent
formation of AmMnP. The dissolution of MnCO3 caused an
increase in carbonate ions in the solution. Accordingly, the pH value
of the solution increased with the milling time (Figure S5). The subsequent precipitation of AmMnP occurs via
the reaction of NH4+ and MnPO4– in water. The formation reaction can be described
as follows 3   4   5  A key step for producing products via this
method is a gradual dissolution process of the raw material in the
solution. Recently, we successfully synthesized Li1.81H0.19Ti2O5·xH2O and Sr3Al2(OH)12 through
the same wet milling method in water.23,24 In each case,
a combination of water-soluble materials (LiOH and Sr(OH)2) and insoluble materials (TiO2 and Al2O3) was employed. The insoluble oxides can gradually dissolve
in the basic solution in which each hydroxide is dissolved. As the
reactant of MnCO3 is continually supplied by the precipitation
of AmMnP, the rate-determining step of the formation of AmMnP is the
dissolution of MnCO3 in water. Further, the grinding of
raw materials via wet milling causes an acceleration of the dissolution
in the solution. The use of high-energy mills such as a planetary
ball mill is suitable for an improvement of the reaction rate.

2.4 Conversion of AmMnP into LiMnPO4 via Different Approaches
Investigations of the conversion
reaction of AmMnP into olivine-type cathodes are crucial for industrial
applications of lithium/sodium-ion batteries because battery performances
depend on the shapes and structural modifications of cathode particles
prepared via different conversion methods. Here, we compared the powder
properties of three converted LiMnPO4 powders originating
from AmMnP rod particles: a solid-state reaction with LiOH (SS-LMP);
a hydrothermal reaction in an LiNO3 solution (HT-LMP);
and an annealing treatment of HT-LMP (HTA-LMP). Figure 6 shows the Rietveld refinements of the XRD
patterns of the three products; LiMnPO4 was obtained via
both conversion routes (solid-state and hydrothermal reactions). Both
products exhibited an orthorhombic olivine structure (Pnma). The reaction with lithium sources at high temperatures leads to
the formation of impurity phases.11 The
SS-LMP powder in this study also contained tiny amounts of Mn2O3 as a byproduct, whereas HT-LMP was phase pure.
The Rietveld analysis was carried out for all phases except the impurity phase. Compared with the
diffraction peak intensities of SS-LMP and HT-LMP, the (101) and (020)/(211)
reflections of SS-LMP were relatively high. Furthermore, sharper diffraction
peaks were detected in HT-LMP. The lattice parameters after the refinements
are summarized in Table 1. The a-axis of HT-LMP was slightly elongated. These
results imply that LiMnPO4 converted via a solid-state
reaction experienced a particle growth at high temperatures. Figure 7 shows the SEM images
of the SS-LMP and HT-LMP powders. Although the rod shapes of AmMnP
were maintained in both conversion methods, the aspect ratio of the
SS-LMP particles seemed to be low. This is caused by a particle growth
at high temperatures. The hydrothermal treatment with the Li+ solution can cause an ion-exchange reaction of NH4+, thereby maintaining the original particle shape. The plate-like
AmMnP particles, in addition, were also converted to LiMnPO4 while maintaining the particle shape (results not shown). Therefore,
a hydrothermal conversion route is suitable for the preparation of
olivine cathodes via the conversion of AmMeP with specific particle
shapes. Koleva et al. reported that the annealing of LiMnPO4 converted from AmMnP leads to an anisotropic crystal growth.15 In this study, the annealing of HT-LMP at 600
°C (HTA-LMP) resulted in an increase in the intensities of the
(210) and (020)/(211) reflections (Figure 6c), which resembled the XRD pattern of SS-LMP.
Although annealing improves the cation order in crystals after the
initial crystallization, a particle growth is inevitable for nanocrystals.25 Annealing conditions such as temperature and
holding time should be controlled to improve the cathode properties
while maintaining the particle shape of olivine compounds after a
hydrothermal conversion from AmMeP.

the process of evaluating the electrochemical
performances of olivine cathodes converted from AmMeP for lithium-ion
batteries. The developed method can enable the synthesis of various
metal phosphates. The results of the cathode applications will be
reported in a future manuscript.

3 Conclusions
Ammonium manganese phosphate (AmMnP) was synthesized via planetary
ball milling of NH4H2PO4 and MnCO3 in water at room temperature. The obtained particles possess
various shapes (plates, flakes, rods, and nanoparticles) depending
on the milling conditions. This water-based synthesis method including
a dissolution–precipitation mechanism is in contrast to the
solid-state synthesis of AmMnP, which occurs at the particle interface
and forms isotropic particles. The conversion to LiMnPO4 via the reaction with lithium compounds was investigated to elucidate
the effect of preparation approaches on the powder properties. The
hydrothermal treatment of AmMnP in a lithium solution can maintain
the original particle shape. However, a subsequent heat treatment
at high temperatures (e.g., annealing) leads to particle growth. The
classical mechanical process in a solution can produce fine particles
with a unique morphology by combining grinding and precipitation steps.
Further investigations on the dynamics in the milling pot such as
ball movement and flow of particles and solutions between balls will
help the development of local reaction fields to control particle
morphologies.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis Procedure of AmMnP
The
raw materials NH4H2PO4 (purity: 99.0%;
Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan) and MnCO3 (99.9%; Kojundo
Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd., Japan) were used for the AmMnP synthesis.
These powders (3 g; molar ratio of NH4H2PO4/MnCO3 = 1.2:1) and distilled water (20 mL) were
processed in a planetary ball mill (High-G BX254E; Kurimoto, Ltd.,
Japan). They were put into a stainless steel vessel (170 cm3) with Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 balls
(100 g; diameter, ϕ: 1–5 mm; Nikkato Corp., Japan). The
vessel was sealed and then rotated for 0.25–5 h under centrifugal
accelerations of 10–50 G. The centrifugal acceleration was
controlled via the revolution speed, and the ratio of rotation/revolution
speeds was fixed to approximately 0.5. After the wet milling, the
product was collected via centrifugation, washed several times with
distilled water, and dried in an oven at 100 °C.

4.2 Conversion of AmMnP to LiMnPO4
AmMnP with
rod shapes was converted to an LiMnPO4 olivine-type
cathode through different approaches: solid-state reaction and hydrothermal
reaction.

4.2.1 Solid-State Reaction
The mixture
of AmMnP and LiOH·H2O (>99%; Kanto Chemical Co.,
Inc.)
in a molar ratio of 1:1.15 was prepared by grinding it with an agate
mortar and adding a small amount of ethanol. The mixed powder was
heated at 500 °C for 2 h under an Ar flow. The resulting product
was washed with distilled water and ethanol and dried in an oven.
The LiMnPO4 powder converted via the solid-state reaction
is denoted as SS-LMP.

4.2.2 Hydrothermal Reaction
The AmMnP
powder (0.5 g) and 1 M LiNO3 (20 mL; Wako Pure Chemical
Corp., Japan) were put into a Teflon-lined autoclave (50 cm3) and heated at 120 °C for 6 h under stirring. After the reaction,
the product was collected, washed, and dried. This resulting powder
is denoted as HT-LMP. Additionally, the HT-LMP powder was annealed
at 600 °C for 10 h in air (denoted as HTA-LMP).

4.3 Characterization
The crystalline
phases of the products were characterized via powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD; D2 PHASER, Bruker AXS K. K., Japan) using Cu Kα radiation
generated at 30 kV and 10 mA. The diffraction patterns were acquired
with steps of 0.02° (2θ) and a counting time of 1 s/step.
The structures of the converted LiMnPO4 were refined using
the Rietveld method with the RIETAN-FP program.26 The molecular structure of AmMnP was analyzed via diffuse
reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR; IRPrestige-21,
Shimadzu Corp., Japan). The powder sample (1 mg) was mixed with dry
KBr (100 mg; IR spectroscopy grade, Merck KGaA., Germany) and filled
into the sample holder. A thermogravimetric–differential thermal
analysis (TG–DTA; TG/DTA6200, SII Inc., Japan) was carried
out in air at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The particle morphologies
of the products were observed using a field-emission scanning electron
microscope (FE-SEM; SU-70, Hitachi Ltd., Japan). The specific surface
area of the product was estimated from N2 adsorption measurements
(3Flex, Micromeritics Ltd., Japan). Prior to each measurement, the
powder was outgassed under vacuum at 120 °C for 3 h. The specific
surface area was calculated via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method.
