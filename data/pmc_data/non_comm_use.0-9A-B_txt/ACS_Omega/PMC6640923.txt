Rapidly
responding stimuli-responsive materials can have a benefit
in a myriad of applications, for example, sensing and biosensing,
actuation, and in drug delivery systems. Thermo- and pH-responsive
materials have been among the most widely studied, and can be triggered
at physiologically relevant temperatures and pH. Here, we have used
a “homologous series” of acids based on the acrylic
acid (AAc) backbone and incorporated them into N-isopropylacrylamide
(NIPAm)-based microgels. Specifically, the acids used were AAc, methacrylic
acid (MAAc), ethylacrylic acid (EAAc), and butylacrylic acid (BAAc),
which have pKa’s in the range of
4.25–7.4. The resultant microgels were characterized by optical
microscopy, and their responsivity to temperature and pH studied by
dynamic light scattering. The microgels were subsequently used to
generate optical devices (etalons) and their pH and temperature response
was also investigated. We found that the devices composed of BAAc-modified
microgels exhibit unusually fast response kinetics relative to those
of the rest of the devices. We also found that the speed of the response
decreased as the length of the acid pendant group decreased, with
AAc-modified microgel-based devices exhibiting the slowest response
kinetics. Finally, we showed that the kinetics of the device’s
temperature response also decreased as the length of the acid pendant
group decreased, which we hypothesize is a consequence of the hydrophobicity
of the acid groups, that is, increased hydrophobicity leads to faster
responses. Understanding this behavior can lead to the rational design
of fast responding materials for the applications mentioned above.

Introduction
Stimuli-responsive
polymers (or simply responsive polymers) that
respond to their environment by undergoing changes in their chemical
and/or physical properties have been known for a number of decades.
Specifically, responsive polymers have been developed that respond
to changes in solution pH,1−5 temperature,5−10 ionic strength,11,12 and the application of an electric
field,13 magnetic field,14 and/or light.6,15 Of the various stimuli-responsive
polymers, those that respond to changes in temperature are the most
extensively studied, and poly (N-isopropylacrylamide)
(pNIPAm) has emerged as the most popular polymer over the past few
decades.10 Since its first discovery in
1968,16 pNIPAm has been used for numerous
applications including: sensing and biosensing,17,18 drug delivery,19−21 tissue engineering,22 antifouling
coatings,23 and “smart” optical
systems.8 This is partially a result of
pNIPAm’s volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) of 32 °C,
which is near the range of physiological relevance. Specifically,
below this temperature, pNIPAm exists as a random coil (extended state),
and transitions into a globular conformation (collapsed state) above
32 °C. Furthermore, pNIPAm is “hydrated” below
the VPTT and “dehydrated” above the VPTT; this transition
is fully reversible over many cycles.

Cross-linked polymer networks
composed of pNIPAm can also be generated,
and exhibit behavior similar to that of pure pNIPAm. That is, the
materials (hydrogels) are swollen with water below the VPTT, and deswollen
above the VPTT. Hydrogel particles (microgels) can also be synthesized,
and behave similarly to hydrogels; they have also found numerous applications.24−26 Their relative “ease” of synthesis and the ability
to vary the microgel chemistry/responsivity via simple copolymerization,
has made the use of microgels very attractive. For example, to make
pNIPAm-based microgels pH responsive, a weak acid/base can be copolymerized
into the network. A common pH-responsive monomer that is used is acrylic
acid (AAc), which has a pKa of ∼4.25.
Upon copolymerizing with NIPAm, the network becomes responsive to
pH due to the ionization of AAc at pH > pKa, which causes the gel to swell as a result of charge–charge
repulsion and an increase in the material’s osmotic pressure.27 The network returns to its initial state at
pH < pKa. This phenomenon has been
exploited for pH sensing,28 ion sensing,
and drug delivery.19 Other pH-responsive
comonomers have been studied including MAAc,29,30 maleic anhydride (MA),31 vinyl acetic
acid (VAA),29 and N,N′-dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA).32 Although these responsive materials are well
known, their application has been limited by their relatively slow
response time to solution pH changes. Hence, new materials with fast
response times to solution pH are desired to realize new applications.

Our group is interested in fabricating pH sensors from responsive
polymers composed of monomers with pKa values covering the entire pH scale. In the process of fabricating
these pH sensors, we observed that variations in the alkyl chain length
of the pendant group on AAc-based comonomers shifts the pKa toward more physiologically relevant pHs, which is similar
to what was observed by Grainger et al.33 More importantly, we observed that the speed of the response was
significantly improved as the length of the pendant alkyl chain increased.
As mentioned before, materials with fast response kinetics to pH changes
are needed for various applications, such as: actuators for chemical
valves,34 artificial muscles,35 and “on/off” switches for controlling
chemical reactions.36 To achieve such materials,
Zhang et al.37 reported on the fabrication
of a comb-type grafted hydrogel, by grafting free pNIPAm and pDMAEMA
chains onto the backbone of a cross-linked pNIPAm-co-pDMAEMA network. They reported a faster swelling rate and higher
swelling degree (at lower pH) for the grafted hydrogels compared to
that of the native cross-linked pNIPAm-co-pDMAEMA
hydrogels. In another example, Yan et al.38 copolymerized a polymeric surfactant, poly(2-(methacryloyl-oxy)decyl
phosphate), with pNIPAm to generate gels with improved response kinetics.
They observed an 88% swelling ratio within 30 min and a complete collapse
within 120 min (from the swollen state) in response to temperature.
This is in contrast to the 24% swelling ratio within 30 min for the
unmodified pNIPAm gels. To obtain macroscopic gels with fast response
to external stimuli, Richtering and co-workers39 embedded pNIPAm-based microgels in a polyacrylamide hydrogel
matrix. The embedded microgels rendered the microgel–polyacrylamide
composite thermo-responsive, yielding a faster response relative to
the hydrogels themselves. Several other studies have been devoted
to improving the response time of pH/thermo-responsive systems using
various grafting approaches.40−42

In this investigation,
we demonstrate that the pH-dependent response
kinetics could be varied by manipulating the chain length of the pendant
group attached to the second carbon of AAc. Specifically, the response
kinetics to solution pH changes become faster as the alkyl chain length
increases. To investigate this, we synthesized a series of acid modified
microgels via free radical precipitation polymerization. The weak
acid monomers differed from one another by the length of their alkyl
group, that is, AAc, methacrylic acid (MAAc), ethylacrylic acid (EAAc),
or butylacrylic acid (BAAc). The resultant microgels were characterized
by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy and dynamic
light scattering (DLS) at various solution temperatures and pH. Similar
to microgels made of AAc, the microgels composed of MAAc, EAAc, and
BAAc could be ionized at solution pH above their respective pKa of 5.5, 6.3, and 7.4.33

We go on to show that optical sensing devices (etalons43) could be constructed from these microgels and
used to monitor real time solution pH. This was accomplished by constructing
layered materials composed of two thin Au layers sandwiching the pNIPAm-based
microgels. A schematic of the structure of the etalons can be seen
in Figure 1a, and these
were generated by depositing a thin layer of Au (typically 15 nm)
on top of a glass substrate followed by the deposition of the microgel
layer and a subsequent layer of Au on top of the deposited microgel
layer. This device exhibits color, and the multipeak reflectance spectra
can be seen in Figure 1b. This is due to light impinging on the device resonating in the
microgel-based cavity, leading to constructive/destructive interference,
which allows certain wavelengths of light to be reflected, according
to eq 1 1  where m is
the order of a
“reflected” peak, λ is the reflected wavelength
at a given order of reflection, n is the refractive
index of the dielectric medium, d is the distance
between the two Au mirrors, and θ is the angle of incident light.
In our experiments, θ was maintained at 0°, and with negligible
change in n, and for a particular order m, we see a direct relationship between λ and d. Therefore, any stimuli that can change the etalon’s d-spacing will result in a color change, which can be used
for sensing applications. Although these devices exhibit optical properties
that depend on temperature due to the thermo-responsive behavior of
the pNIPAm-based microgels, the presence of AAc, MAAc, EAAc, and BAAc
in the microgels also affects the device’s color dependent
on pH. That is, when the surrounding solution has a pH > pKa, the microgel’s acid groups are ionized,
resulting in their swelling and a change in (d) and
the wavelength of light reflected from the device, leading to a color
change. We observed the response kinetics to be much faster for the
BAAc microgel-based devices compared to those of the others. Specifically,
the BAAc microgel-based devices respond to pH changes within 2 s,
whereas the others respond in 30 min (AAc), 3.5 min (MAAc), and 6.5
s (EAAc). The fast response of the BAAc microgel-based devices could
be a result of the relatively long pendant alkyl group of the BAAc
and its increased hydrophobicity. This creates a larger interstitial
space between the chains, which increases chain mobility and yields
faster shrinking/swelling kinetics.44,45 This fast
response can be used for various potential applications, for example,
the fabrication of rapid smart sensors and actuators, and rapid drug
delivery systems.

spectrum from a microgel-based etalon showing multiple peaks as a

Results and Discussion
pH-responsive pNIPAm-based microgels
were generated from the respective
pH-responsive monomers (structures shown in Scheme 1a) using free radical precipitation polymerization
at the conditions detailed in Scheme 1b. We point out that BAAc was synthesized following
the synthetic route shown in Scheme S1,
which yielded clear oil. Figure 2a–d shows the DIC microscopy images of the synthesized
pNIPAm-based microgels. The resultant microgels were spherical with
homogeneously distributed sizes without observable aggregates present.
DLS was also used to determine the microgel diameter and the change
in diameter as a result of solution pH changes. We expected to observe
an increase in microgel diameter at pH > pKa of the corresponding comonomers due to acid ionization and
further,
we expect the diameter to decrease at pH < pKa due to subsequent acid neutralization. As can be seen in Figures 2e and S3, PNIPAm-based microgels are not responsive
to pH changes, however microgels composed of AAc, MAAc, EAAc, and
BAAc exhibit the expected pH response. That is, the pH-responsive
microgels exhibit an increase in diameter at pH > pKa, and return to their initial diameter at pH < pKa. The observed decrease in average diameter
between pH 4–6 and above pH 8 for BAAc, above 6 for AAc, and
above 7 for EAAc could purely be an artifact of the DLS instrument,
although we are not certain of the source.

Used for This Study and
(b) Polymerization Scheme Used To Generate Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-butylacrylic Acid) (pNIPAm-co-BAAc) Microgels
A similar approach
was used to
generate all microgels used in this investigation.

Next, we constructed etalons from the microgels synthesized above.
This was done by painting the microgels on a Au-coated glass substrate
followed by the deposition of another Au layer on top of the formed
microgel layer. This process has been described in the Experimental Section and in numerous previous publications.48 As can be predicted from eq 1, an increase in d-spacing
as a result of the deprotonation of the COOH groups (into COO–) leads to an increase in the wavelength of light reflected
from the device (i.e., a red shift). Multiple reflected wavelengths
are expected from the devices as a result of the various orders of
reflection (m in eq 1), which can be seen in Figure 1b. Hence, pH responses and response kinetics
can be determined and compared by monitoring the position of a reflected
peak of a given order as a function of time. To evaluate the responses
of the devices to changes in solution pH, each device was immersed
in an aqueous solution with a pH far above the pKa of the acid comonomers, and the pH instantaneously decreased
to well below the pKa by fast addition
of acid at a stir rate that was constant between experiments. The
response kinetics for the devices to transition from a fully swollen
to a fully collapsed state and vice-versa are shown in Figure 3. For applications such as
smart actuators for chemical valves,34 and
on/off switches for chemical reactions,36 a large-magnitude instantaneous response to the applied stimulus
is desired. Impressively, it took less than 2 s for the pNIPAm-co-BAAc device to transition from a fully swollen state
to a fully collapsed state. In comparison, pNIPAm-co-EAAc, pNIPAm-co-MAAc, and pNIPAm-co-AAc took relatively longer times; about 6.5 s, 3.5 min, and 30 min,
respectively. Movies showing the fast response of pNIPAm-co-BAAc in comparison to that of pNIPAm-co-EAAc are
shown in the ESI. It must be pointed out
that all four microgels differ structurally due to the different lengths
of the pendant alkyl groups on the AAc backbone (Scheme 1a). Hence, any difference in
response can primarily be attributed to the pendant group chain length.
We hypothesize that the “packing density” for a given
“mass” of the microgels is higher for pNIPAm-co-AAc (due to the relatively smaller size of the AAc group)
relative to that of the pNIPAm-co-BAAc microgels,
which we predict will have a less dense internal structure due to
the larger BAAc. The implication of this hypothesis is that the diffusion
rate of water in and out of the microgels increases with increasing
chain length of the pendant group of the microgels. This also permits
rapid ionization and neutralization of the corresponding acid groups
in the microgels.

(b) pNIPAm-co-EAAc, (c) pNIPAm-co-MAAc, and (d) pNIPAm-co-AAc etalons to solution
pH changes. The main figure in each case depicts the response kinetics
going from high pH (10) to low pH (4 for (a); 3 for (b–d)).
The insets represent the reverse, from low pH to high pH. In all cases,
the solution pH was adjusted by addition of 1 M HCl or NaOH. The different
data symbols represent data from different devices, and the arrows
point to the critical time that the devices completed their response
to pH.

We further explored the possibility
of using the pNIPAm-co-BAAc etalon as a fast responding
pH and temperature sensor.
The pH range at which the device has the greatest response (highest
sensitivity) was examined by immersing the device in a solution of
low pH and gradually increasing the pH by addition of 0.1 M NaOH whilst
monitoring the peak position. As can be seen from Figure 4a, the device responds to pH
over the range of pH 6–9 and hence it can be used over the
physiologically relevant pH range. We observed that the wavelength
(λmax) increased gradually below pH 6 (protonated
form COOH) and sharply between 6 and 9 (deprotonated form COO–), and plateaued beyond pH 9 (fully deprotonated) (Figure 4a). The reversibility
of the device’s response to pH was also probed as the pH was
decreased by the addition of 0.1 M HCl. A phenomenon similar to the
above has been observed in copolymers composed of AAc,3,12,48,49 MAAc,50 and propylacrylic acid (PAAc)51 with NIPAm (pNIPAm-co-AAc,
pNIPAm-co-MAAc, and pNIPAm-co-PAAc,
respectively). We also investigated the device’s response to
repeated solution pH changes. This was done by immersing a single
device in a solution of pH 2, allowing it to stabilize, and recording
the spectrum. After stabilization, the pH was increased instantaneously
to 11 by addition of 1.0 M NaOH, and again allowed to stabilize and
a spectrum recorded. This process was repeated multiple times. As
can be seen in Figure 4b, the device’s response to repeated solution pH changes was
highly reproducible, with a low standard deviation for the magnitude
of the responses between devices. The ability to reuse a single device
many times and still maintaining its performance is practically ideal
from an economic point of view. Again, for the device to still maintain
its performance between these extreme pH ranges suggests that the
device can survive harsh pH conditions.

for the pNIPAm-co-BAAc etalons: (□) increasing
pH and (Ο) decreasing pH. (b) The repeatability of the pNIPAm-co-BAAc etalon’s response to solution pH. Each data
point is the average obtained from three separate etalons with the
error bars showing the standard deviation.

As pNIPAm is a well-known thermo-responsive polymer, we expected
that copolymers composed of NIPAm should maintain their thermoresponsivity.10 As shown in Figure 5 (and in Figures S3 and S4), the pNIPAm microgel-based devices maintained their thermoresponsivity.
Specifically, as can be seen in Figure 5a, increasing solution temperature from 25 to 41 °C
at pH 3 led to the expected blue shift of the peaks in the reflectance
spectrum. The blue shift is a result of the decreased spacing between
the two gold mirrors due to the collapse of the microgels. In Figure 5a, we have also shown
the spectra for 25, 31, 35, and 41 °C for clarity. Figure 5b shows how the position of
the reflectance peak depends on temperature. The wavelength decreased
gradually as the temperature increased from 25 °C and then decreased
sharply near the transition temperature of ∼31 °C. Above
the transition temperature, the microgels are in their collapsed state;
hence, no further decrease in wavelength was observed as the temperature
was further increased above the primary transition temperature. Upon
decreasing the solution temperature, the devices returned to their
initial state, and the process can be repeated multiple times as can
be seen in Figure 5c. We point out that the abrupt thermoresponsivity is observed at
pH where the pNIPAm-co-BAAc microgels are in the
protonated state (pH 3). At this pH, the microgels have no charge
and can freely collapse and swell as the temperature is increased/decreased,
respectively.52 On the contrary, at higher
pH > pKa of BAAc, the pNIPAm-co-BAAc microgels are negatively charged and are swollen
due to Coulombic
repulsion of like charges and osmotic pressure build up within the
microgel.27 Therefore, any further attempt
to change the microgel’s diameter with temperature does not
yield any significant transition, as the Coulombic force of repulsion53 is greater than the entropy-driven collapse
of the microgels. This is shown in Figure 5d for the pNIPAm-co-BAAc
etalon device and in the Supporting Information for all of the microgels investigated here.

etalon at (Ο) pH 10 and (□) pH 3, well above and below
the pKa of BAAc, respectively.

We also investigated the response kinetics of the
pNIPAm-co-BAAc and pNIPAm-co-AAc
microgel-based
etalons to temperature. Here, the temperature control system was set
to increase the solution temperature from ∼23 to 60 °C
at a heating rate of 0.6 °C s–1. The full response
curves for both the pNIPAm-co-BAAc and pNIPAm-co-AAc microgel-based etalons to this increased solution
temperature are shown in Figure 6. We point out that a single device was used for multiple
heating cycles and each curve in Figure 6 represents one heating cycle. As can be
seen in Figure 6a,
a rapid transition from the swollen to collapsed state (i.e., a blue
shift in reflectance peak position) was observed for the pNIPAm-co-BAAc etalon, whereas the pNIPAm-co-AAc
etalon (Figure 6b)
exhibited much slower response kinetics at the same heating rate and
solution pH. This observation further supports our hypothesis above
that the hydrophobic effect (with increased void space) can lead to
an increased diffusion rate of water in and out of the microgels with
increased chain length of the pendant group (BAAc). These points taken
together lead to the enhanced response kinetics.

each case, and the data obtained as a function of the (□) first,

Conclusions
We have synthesized
pH-responsive microgels that exhibit responses
over a broad pH range. Furthermore, we have generated optical devices
composed of the microgels that exhibit optical properties that depend
on solution pH. As a result of these studies, we found that some of
the devices exhibited unusually fast response kinetics that we found
to depend on the length of the pendant group on the acid incorporated
in the microgels. Specifically, the response to pH was the fastest
for the pNIPAm-co-BAAc etalon, whereas the pNIPAm-co-AAc etalon exhibited the slowest response. We hypothesized
that this enhanced response speed can be attributed to: (1) the increased
hydrophobicity of the pNIPAm-co-BAAc microgel, which
can lead to a faster transition to its deswollen state; and/or (2)
the length of the butyl group on BAAc creating a lower packing density
and a less dense internal structure, resulting in a larger interstitial
space between chains and increased chain mobility and faster shrinking/swelling
kinetics. These hypotheses were further supported by an investigation
of the temperature response kinetics, which were improved for the
pNIPAm-co-BAAc etalon relative to those of the pNIPAm-co-AAc etalon. With this knowledge, low cost and easy to
use pH (and related) sensors could be developed for a wide variety
of applications where rapid response time is of great importance.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Unless otherwise specified, all reagents
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada). NIPAm was
purified by re-crystallization from hexanes and vacuum dried. N,N′-methylene(bisacrylamide) (BIS),
ammonium persulfate (APS), AAc, MAAc, EAAc, piperidine, formaldehyde,
ethanol, n-butylmalonic acid, ethyl acetate, and
anhydrous MgSO4 were used without further purification.
2-BAAc was synthesized following the procedure reported by Pratt et
al.46 with some modifications. A pH meter
(JENCO 6173 pH, San Diego, CA) was used to prepare solutions with
known pH, using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl)
to adjust the pH. A conductivity meter (Orion Star A212, Indonesia)
was used for conductivity measurements. Millipore water (18.2 MΩ
cm) from a Milli-Q Plus system (Z00QSVC01; Fisher, Toronto, ON, Canada)
was used for all experiments. A Rotovap RV 8 (IKA, Wilmington, NC)
was used to remove organic solvents.

Synthesis of BAAc
BAAc was synthesized using a modified
version of what was reported by Pratt et al.46 Specifically, piperidine (7.5 mmol, 0.74 mL) and formaldehyde (31.3
mmol, 2.3 mL) were added to a solution of n-butylmalonic
acid (6.2, mmol, 1.00 g) in ethanol (11.6 mL). The solution was heated
to 85 °C under reflux with stirring, during which a white precipitate
appeared and steadily re-dissolved over 1 h. The mixture was stirred
at 85 °C (under reflux) overnight and then cooled to room temperature.
The solvent was removed under reduced pressure using rotoevaporation.
The residue was then dissolved in ethyl acetate (12 mL) and transferred
into a separatory funnel. The mixture was washed successively with
1.0 M HCl and brine (5%), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and
vacuum-filtered (Whatman #1 filter paper) yielding a clear oil. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz): δH 6.27
(s, 1H), 5.63 (s, 1H), 2.32–2.28 (m, 2H), 1.49–1.23
(m, 4H), 0.91 (t, 3H). Mass spectrometry (MS) was also used to characterize
the BAAc, and revealed the molecular ion peak of (M – H) at
127.0764, see Supporting Information. Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of both BAAc and pNIPAm-co-BAAc are also shown in the Supporting Information, and exhibit the expected vibrational frequencies
at 2960 cm–1 (O–H), 2875 cm–1 (=CH), 1697 cm–1 (C=O), and 1629
cm–1 (C=C).

Synthesis of pNIPAm-Based
Microgels
The microgels were
synthesized by free radical precipitation polymerization, similar
to a previously published procedure.47,48 NIPAm (11.928
mmol) and BIS (0.702 mmol) were weighed into a 250 mL beaker with
99 mL of deionized (DI) water. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h and
filtered through a 0.2 μm filter into a 3-necked round bottom
flask. A reflux condenser was added to the flask, along with a N2 gas inlet (needle) and temperature probe. The solution was
bubbled with N2 gas and allowed to heat to 70 °C over
1.5 h. One of the acids, for example, BAAc/EAAc/MAAc/AAc (1.403 mmol),
was added to the heated reaction mixture in one aliquot, and the polymerization
was immediately initiated by the addition of APS (0.2 mmol) dissolved
in 1 mL of DI water. The solution turned white/cloudy after ∼1
min, showing successful initiation. The reaction was then allowed
to proceed at 70 °C for 4 h under a blanket of N2 gas.
The resulting suspension was allowed to cool overnight, followed by
filtration through glass wool to remove any large aggregates. The
microgel solution was then distributed into centrifuge tubes and purified
via centrifugation at ∼10 000 rpm for ∼30 min
to form a pellet, followed by removal of the supernatant and resuspension
in DI water; this was repeated 6×. The purified microgels were
stored for further use. The actual amount of ionic comonomers in the
microgels was estimated by potentiometric and conductometric titrations,
as shown in the Supporting Information.

Preparation of Etalons
Etalons were fabricated according
to our group’s previously published “paint on”
protocol.43 Briefly, Au-coated coverslips
(etalon underlayer) were fabricated by depositing 2 nm of Cr and 15
nm of Au onto a 25 × 25 mm2 ethanol-rinsed and N2 gas-dried glass coverslip (Fisher’s Finest, Ottawa,
ON) via thermal evaporation at a rate of 1 and 0.1 Å s–1, respectively (Torr International Inc., thermal evaporation system,
model THEUPG, New Windsor, NY). The Cr/Au substrates were annealed
at 250 °C for 3 h (Thermolyne muffle furnace, Ottawa, ON, Canada)
and cooled to room temperature prior to microgel film deposition.
The annealed glass slides were rinsed with ethanol and water followed
by N2 gas drying. The concentrated microgel pellets obtained
via centrifugation were vortexed to loosen and homogenize the microgels,
and a 40 μL aliquot of concentrated microgel was spread onto
the annealed 25 mm × 25 mm Au-coated glass coverslip. The film
was allowed to dry on a 30 °C hotplate for 2 h followed by rinsing
of the excess microgels with DI water. The samples were soaked overnight
at 30 °C in a DI water bath. The samples were then rinsed with
DI water, dried with N2, and another Au overlayer (2 nm
Cr for adhesion, followed by 15 nm Au) was deposited under the same
conditions as the underlayer. The completed device was soaked in DI
water overnight at 30 °C, after which the etalon assembly (Figure 1a) was ready for
spectral analysis.

Characterization
DIC microscope
images were acquired
on an Olympus inverted research microscope (IX71), at 100× magnification.
Hydrodynamic diameters were measured on a Malvern Instruments (Westborough,
MA) Zetasizer Nano ZS equipped with a 633 nm laser. NMR spectra were
collected using an Agilent/Varian Inova four-channel 500 MHz spectrometer
(Santa Clara, CA), with CDCl3 as solvent. Reflectance measurements
for the etalons in response to solution pH and temperature were obtained
using a Red Tide USB650 spectrometer, a LS-1 tungsten light source,
and a reflectance probe from Ocean Optics (Dunedin, FL). The spectra
were recorded using Ocean Optics Spectra Suite Spectroscopy Software
over a wavelength range of 350–1000 nm. A custom-built temperature
controlled chamber (Electronic Department, University of Alberta)
was used to maintain solution temperature and hold the etalon in a
stable position. We point out that a 0.6 °C change in temperature
was observed as a result of the neutralization reaction required to
change the solution pH. Despite this, this temperature change is not
significant enough to contribute to the observed kinetics. Additionally,
the experimental conditions for all of the devices were constant,
and therefore the temperature effect can be ignored, and the response
kinetics to solution pH changes can be directly compared. Videos were
recorded using a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, 16 MP OIS (F1.9). Infrared
spectra were collected on a Thermo Nicolet 8700 FTIR Spectrometer,
and MS was run on an orthogonal acceleration TOF6220 ESI in negative
ion mode (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) operating in full
scan mode.
