Acidophilic highly-photoluminescent
ionic liquid (IL)-modified
carbon dots (CDs) were fabricated directly from polyethylene glycol-2000
(PEG2000N) by a simple one-step hydrothermal method in
a system containing an IL (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide [C4mim]Br) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). In this process, PEG2000N works as the carbon source, [C4mim]Br as the
modifier, and HCl as the accelerator. CDs with low photoluminescence
(PL) intensity and quantum yields (QYs) were generated in the system
without H+, but CDs with high PL intensity and QYs could
be prepared after H+ was introduced. Moreover, with the
increase of H+ concentration, the QYs of the prepared CDs
increase subsequently, and the highest QY reaches up to 43%. The formation
mechanism was explored, and the results showed that H+ changes
the surface groups of the CDs generated without H+ into
those that exist on the CDs generated with H+, which further
improves the PL performance of the CDs. Different from most CDs reported
in the literature, the as-prepared CDs can still exhibit high PL intensity
even under strong acidic condition.

Introduction
In recent years, carbon
dots (CDs), one novel type of “zero-dimensional”
carbon nanomaterials, have received much attention owing to their
low cost, superior chemical stability, alluring optical properties,
and high biocompatibility.1,2 Owing to these attractive
merits, CDs have recently been regarded as one of the most promising
nanomaterials for bioimaging, fluorescence sensors, drug delivery,
optoelectronic devices, and so forth.3−8 During the last decades, many methods have been proposed to prepare
CDs, and they can be generally classified into two approaches including
“top-down” and “bottom-up”. The former
involves cleaving or breaking down of carbonaceous materials via chemical,
electrochemical, or physical approaches. The latter is realized by
pyrolysis/carbonization of small organic molecules or by a stepwise
chemical fusion of small aromatic molecules.9 However, the CDs obtained from the above methods still required
further surface passivation or oxidation to improve their fluorescence
properties. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a simple method for
the synthesis of self-passivated CDs.

During the formation process
of CDs, acids usually work as the
oxidation reagent or the catalytic reagent,10,11 and the concentration of acids has been demonstrated to be a decisive
factor in governing the photoluminescence (PL) properties of the obtained
CDs.12,13 However, the effect and function of acids
added to the reaction systems have rarely been investigated.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a hydrophilic linear polymer and the
most popular surface-passivating material. Moreover, PEG has been
widely used to functionalize CDs for improving their PL performance.14,15 However, the research on the CDs made from PEG as the carbon source
has been rarely reported, and the obtained CDs usually suffer from
low quantum yield (QY) and are easily quenched under strong acidic
condition. For example, Fan et al.16 used
PEG with different molar weights (PEG400N, PEG1500N, and PEG6000N) as the carbon source to prepare CDs by
a simple hydrothermal method, and their QYs were lower than 4%. Chen
et al.17 synthesized different CDs directly
from PEG400N by a one-pot thermal treatment under different
times, and the QYs were lower than 4%. Li et al.18 reported an electrolytic method to synthesize three CDs
from different PEGs with different molecular weights (PEG200N, PEG600N, and PEG800N), and their QYs were
in the range of 30–38%. However, the PL intensity of all of
these CDs would be quenched under strong acidic condition. Thus, it
is a very challenging goal to improve the QYs of the prepared CDs
using PEG as the carbon source and to maintain their PL stability
under strong acidic condition.

Ionic liquids (ILs) are organic
salts consisting of entire ionic
species, and they have been gaining great attention because of their
unique characteristics.19−22 ILs have some obvious advantages in the synthesis
of nanomaterials.23 For example, they can
increase the nucleation rate because of their low interfacial tension.
Consequently, particles with small sizes can be easily generated in
them. In addition, ILs have the capacity to stabilize the particles
because of their low interface energy and designable structures, which
can prevent aggregation among nanoparticles effectively. Besides,
ILs can also be adopted as doping agents to synthesize high PL CDs
without additional doping agents or processes because of their heteroatom-containing
structures.

Herein, we report a facile and low-cost route to
prepare highly
fluorescent CDs by a one-pot hydrothermal treatment. In this process,
PEG2000N plays a role as the carbon source, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
bromide ([C4mim]Br) as the modifier, and H+ as
the accelerator. The obtained CDs not only emitted bright blue fluorescence
in water but also showed green fluorescence in common organic solvents.
Compared with other CDs synthesized from PEG, the obtained CDs have
the highest QY (43%) to our knowledge and could exhibit high PL intensity
under strong acidic condition.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
[C4mim]Br (≥99.0%)
and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C4mim]Cl, ≥99.0%)
were purchased from Lanzhou Institute of Physical Chemistry, China.
PEG-2000 (PEG2000N) was obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry
Co., Ltd., Japan. H2SO4 (95.0–98.0%),
HCl (36.0–38.0%), HBr (40.0%), K2HPO4·3H2O (≥99.0%), KH2PO4 (≥99.0%), and H3PO4 (85.0%) were obtained
from Luoyang Haohua Reagent Co., Ltd., China. NaOH (96.0%) and NaCl
(99.5%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation, China,
and Nanjing Reagent Co., Ltd., China, respectively. All chemicals
were used as received without further purification.

Apparatus
Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorption spectra and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a TU-1900
UV–vis spectrophotometer (Purkinje, Beijing) and an FP-6500
fluorescence spectrophotometer (JASCO, Japan), respectively. Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were carried out on a spectrum 400F
spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Instrument Co., Ltd, America). The
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 XRD
diffractometer with Cu Kα as the incident radiation (Bruker,
Germany). The morphology and size dimension of the CDs were analyzed
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images using a JEM-2100
electron microscope (JEOL, Japan). The X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra
were performed on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using Al Kα
as the X-ray excitation source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, America).

Synthesis
A series of CDs were synthesized through
a one-step hydrothermal method. In brief, 0.3 g [C4mim]Br
and 0.9 g PEG2000N were mixed, respectively, with 0/20/40/60/80/120/140/160/180/200
μL of concentrated HCl (12 mol/L), and then the solution volumes
were fixed at 2 mL with deionized water. Each mixture obtained was
sealed into a 15 mL Teflon stainless steel autoclave and subjected
to heat at 200 °C for 12 h. The resultant orange liquids were
neutralized by NaOH and HCl solution, and then they were dialyzed
against water using dialysis membranes (retained molecular weight:
3500 Da) for 48 h to remove impurities. Finally, dry brown CDs were
obtained by heating the dialysate, and the CDs prepared with different
concentrations of HCl were denoted as CDs-0, CDs-0.12, CDs-0.24, ...,
and CDs-1.20, respectively.

QY Measurements
The QYs of the CDs
were determined
by comparing the integrated PL intensity of the CDs (excited by 410
nm) with the absorbance values (at 410 nm) of the samples using quinine
sulfate as the standard. The QYs were obtained by the following equation24,25  where Φ is the QY, m is the
slope of integrated fluorescence intensity versus absorbance,
and η is the refractive index of the solvent. The subscripts
ST and S refer to the standard and the sample, respectively.

Results
and Discussion
Optimization of the Experimental Conditions
The digital
images of different CD suspensions under sunlight are shown in Figure S1a, and the corresponding digital images
taken under UV light are displayed in Figure S1b. It can be seen from Figure S1a that
the solution color hardly changed under sunlight. All CD suspensions
exhibited blue fluorescence when exposed to an ultraviolet lamp unit
at 365 nm (Figure S1b). The PL intensity
first increases with the increase of HCl concentration and then remains
unchanged. The QYs of all of the CDs are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the QYs
increase obviously with the increase of HCl concentration up to 0.96
mol/L, and the highest QY is 43%, which is higher than the QYs of
most CDs prepared from PEG (Table S1).16,17,26 On the basis of the QYs, other
reaction conditions were optimized, and the selected optimal conductions
were as follows: 0.3 g [C4mim]Br, 0.9 g PEG2000N, and 0.96 mol/L HCl were heated at 200 °C for 12 h.

Structures
CDs-0.96 with the highest QY were selected
for further investigation. The size and morphology of CDs-0.96 were
investigated by TEM. The TEM image (Figure 1a) shows that CDs-0.96 have quasi-spherical
morphology with relatively uniform sizes distributed within 1.0–5.4
nm, and their average diameter is 2.5 nm. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
image (Figure 1b) shows
that CDs-0.96 have complicated structures. Most of the CDs-0.96 are
amorphous carbon particles without any lattices, whereas rare CDs
possess well-resolved lattice fringes. The carbon structure of CDs-0.96
can be confirmed by the XRD pattern (Figure 1c). Figure 1c displays two diffraction peaks centered at around
11.8° (0.75 nm) and 19.7° (0.44 nm), which are ascribed
to highly disordered carbon atoms.27

(b) HRTEM image, and (c) XRD pattern of CDs-0.96.
Inset of (a) is the size distribution of the CDs.

The elemental compositions of CDs-0.96 were determined by
XPS.
The XPS spectrum (Figure 2a) indicates that CDs-0.96 are composed of carbon (C1s, 284.3 eV), nitrogen (N1s, 401.3 eV), oxygen (O1s, 531.7 eV), and bromine (Br3d, 67.3 eV), with atomic
percentages of 90.66, 1.50, 7.38, and 0.45%, respectively. The high-resolution
scan of the C1s region (Figure 2b) exhibits three main peaks at 284.1, 284.7,
and 287.4 eV, corresponding to C=C, C–OH, and C=N/C=O,28,29 respectively. Two peaks at 401.1 and 401.5 eV in the N1s spectra (Figure 2c) are attributed to N–H and C=N groups,28,29 respectively. The O1s spectra in Figure 2d exhibit two peaks at 531.4 and 532.4 eV,
which are assigned to C=O and C–OH/C–O–C
species, respectively.30

C1s, (c) N1s, and (d) O1s peaks of
CDs-0.96.

FTIR spectrum was used to get
more information about the functional
groups present in CDs-0.96 (Figure 3). The peaks at 3366 and 1696 cm–1 are ascribed to the stretching vibration of −OH and C=O.31 Three characteristic peaks at 2960, 2930, and
2872 cm–1 are attributed to the stretching bands
of C–H,32,33 whereas the peak at 1384 cm–1 belongs to the symmetric carboxylate stretch, confirming
the existence of rich −OH and −COOH groups.34 The asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations
of C–O–C29 appear at 1086
and 1040 cm–1. The peaks at 1572, 3146, and 3088
cm–1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations of
N–H,35 and the peaks at 1640, 1454,
and 1167 cm–1 represent the absorptions of C=N,29 C–N, and −COOR,36 respectively. For comparison, the FTIR spectra of CDs-0.96,
PEG2000N, and [C4mim]Br are also shown in Figure 4. Apparently, in
the spectrum of CDs-0.96, most of the peaks from PEG2000N have disappeared, whereas those from ILs remained, indicating that
PEG2000N decomposed while [C4mim]Br survived
and worked as the surface modifier linked to CDs-0.96 during the pyrolytic
process.

Optical Properties
Figure 5a shows the
UV–vis and PL absorption
spectra for CDs-0.96 dispersed in water. In the UV–vis absorption
spectrum, a peak at around 205 nm is attributed to the π–π*
transition of aromatic sp2 domains. Meanwhile, the maximum
excitation/emission wavelengths are located at 410/455 nm, respectively.
From the fluorescent emission spectra of CDs-0.96, down-conversion
fluorescence properties have been observed. The maximum emission peaks
red-shift from about 465 to 540 nm with the increasing excitation
wavelengths from 415 to 495 nm (Figure 5b). This common phenomenon may be attributed to the
complicacy of surface-excited states and allows for multiple colors
to be emitted under different excitation wavelengths.37 Meanwhile, the up-conversion PL behaviors are also exhibited
in CDs-0.96 suspension, which red-shift from 410 to 435 nm with decreasing
excitation wavelengths from 750 to 680 nm (Figure 5c). The up-conversion PL is a well-known
nonlinear optical process of converting low-energy incident radiation
into higher-energy output radiation, which shows considerable promise
for applications in areas of 3D luminescent displays, optical storage
disks, optically written displays, and photovoltaic cells.38

spectra,
(b) down-conversion PL properties, and (c) up-conversion PL properties
of CDs-0.96. Insets of (a) are images of the CDs under sunlight and
UV irradiation.

Subsequently, we investigate
the effects of pH, ionic strength,
irradiation times under a UV lamp, and solvent species on the PL properties
of CDs-0.96. As shown in Figure 6a, the PL intensity of CDs-0.96 remains high even at
low pH values and decreases sharply at pH = 9. The PL intensity of
CDs-0.96 remains invariant when exposed to UV laser for 150 min, showing
that the CDs are highly resistant to photobleaching (Figure 6b). In addition, CDs-0.96 show
excellent stability when exposed to environments with high concentrations
of NaCl (Figure 6c).
Interestingly, the as-synthesized CDs exhibit more favorable solubility
in organic solvents (such as ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol,
and dichloromethane) than in water, which may be due to their small
sizes and multitudinous functional groups on their surfaces.29 Different from being dispersed in water, CDs-0.96
have an optimal excitation/emission wavelength at 479/550 nm when
dispersed in all organic solvents (Figure 6d). This strong red shifting is attributed
to the solvation occurring in the organic solvents. The dipoles of
the organic solvents could rotate to align with the excited fluorophore,
which reduces their interaction energy and thus lowers the energy
of the excited fluorophore. Therefore, the results of the solvent
relaxations cause the red shifting of fluorescence.39

strength, and (d) solvent species on the PL intensity of CDs-0.96.

Influence of H+ on Structures and Properties of the
CDs
Four CDs (CDs-0.48, CDs-0.72, CDs-0.96, and CDs-1.20)
were chosen to further explore the influence of H+ concentration
on their structures and properties of the prepared CDs. The FTIR spectra
of these four CDs are collected and shown in Figure 7a. Obviously, they have almost the same functional
groups on their surfaces. More information about the surface functional
groups was further provided by XPS analysis (Figure 7b). The results show that all of these CDs
have the same elemental compositions. However, the contents of each
element in different CDs are different (Table S2). As shown in Table S2, CDs-0.96
and CDs-1.20 have higher N content and QYs. Accordingly, the doped
nitrogen enhances the emission of the CDs through introducing a new
kind of surface state which could induce an upward shift of the Fermi
level and electrons in the conduction band.40 Moreover, the nitrogen bonding to carbon disorders the carbon hexagonal
rings and creates emission energy traps for the CDs through the radiative
recombination induced by electron–hole pairs.41−44

Figure 7 (a)
FTIR spectra and (b) XPS spectra of CDs-0.48, CDs-0.72, CDs-0.96,
and CDs-1.20.

The optical properties
of other three CDs in Figure S2 (CDs-0.48,
CDs-0.72, and CDs-1.20) are similar to
those of CDs-0.96: (1) the optimal excitation/emission wavelengths
of these three CDs are nearly identical to that of CDs-0.96; (2) all
four CDs have similar UV–vis absorption at about 205 nm; (3)
just as CDs-0.96, the three CDs also exhibit down-conversion and up-conversion
PL behaviors during the same wavelength regions (Figure S3). These results clearly indicate that these four
CDs should have the same PL origin.45

From the above results, it can be found that the concentration
of H+ just slightly influenced the surface states of the
prepared CDs but did not change their PL origin.

Formation Mechanism
of the CDs
It is very challenging
to study the formation mechanism of CDs from the bottom-up method
because of their complicated reaction progresses. Here, we try to
propose a formation mechanism of the CDs based on the available characterization
data of the prepared CDs. Initially, a large number of polymer nanoparticles
form because of the aggregation among PEG2000N during heating.
Then, the polymer nanoparticles shrink because of continuous intramolecular
dehydration.46 A number of −COOH/–OH
groups form at this stage, and simultaneously aromatic clusters are
produced inside the polymer nanoparticles.36 When the concentration of the aromatic clusters in some local areas
in the polymer nanoparticles reaches the critical supersaturation
point, the nucleation of the CDs takes place.47 The nuclei grow up with the enhancement of aromatization degree
of the polymer nanoparticles to form the original CDs. Finally, the
imidazole rings are linked to the surface of the CDs through dehydration
between H atoms of imidazole rings and −COOH/–OH groups,
which makes the CDs to be functionalized.

To further confirm
the formation mechanism, we constructed four control experiments:(1) A system
(0.9 g of PEG2000N and 0.3 g of [C4mim]Br) free
of H+ was heated
at 200 °C for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature; the system
showed an extremely weak fluorescence. Subsequently, we introduced
HCl into this system (0.96 mol/L HCl) and continued to heat it at
200 °C for 12 h; strong blue fluorescence in this system was
observed, and the QY increased to 26%. Obvious changes resulting from
the addition of HCl were also observed from the PL and UV–vis
absorption spectra: the optimal excitation/emission wavelengths exhibited
a large red shift after H+ was introduced into the system;
no UV–vis absorption was observed before HCl was introduced,
but a peak located at 199 nm appeared after HCl was added into the
system (Figure 8a).
The UV–vis absorption and excitation/emission wavelengths of
the CDs obtained after the introduction of H+ were approximate
to those of CDs-0.96. These results indicate that the CDs generated
without HCl have surface states different from that with CDs-0.96,
but those prepared after the introduction of HCl have surface groups
similar to that with CDs-0.96. It implies that the presence of HCl
changes the surface groups, emitting weak PL into those generating
strong PL. On the basis of the experimental phenomenon, we can deduce
that HCl accelerates the formation of −COOH/–OH groups
which can react with [C4mim]Br and thus enhances the degree
of functionalization.

(2) A system (0.3 g of [C4mim]Br
and 0.96 mol/L HCl) free of PEG2000N was heated at 200
°C for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature. Subsequently,
0.9 g of PEG2000N was added into the system, and the system
was continually heated at 200 °C for 12 h. The results showed
that before PEG2000N was introduced into the system, very
weak fluorescence was observed, whereas strong blue fluorescence was
generated and the QYs increased to 28% after PEG2000N was
introduced into the system. Figure 8b shows that the UV–vis absorption blue-shifted
from 203.0 to 198.5 nm, and the optimal excitation/emission wavelengths
remained unchanged before and after PEG2000N was introduced
into the system. Also, the UV–vis absorption and excitation/emission
wavelengths of the obtained CDs before and after PEG2000N was added were similar to those of CDs-0.96. These results indicate
that the CDs generated without and with PEG2000N have surface
states similar to that with CDs-0.96, implying that [C4mim]Br just works as a modifier during the formation process.

(3) Similar to the above two
control experiments,
a system (0.9 g of PEG2000N + 0.96 mol/L HCl) was treated
before and after [C4mim]Br was introduced into the system,
and their performances were also measured. Similar to the first control
experiment, the optimal excitation/emission wavelengths of the CDs
prepared before and after [C4mim]Br was added into the
system remain nearly unchanged, and their UV–vis absorption
blue-shifted from 229 to 198.5 nm (Figure 8c). Their QYs increased from 32 to 37%. The
UV–vis absorption of the CDs obtained before [C4mim]Br was added was different from that of CDs-0.96. These results
indicate that PEG2000N works as the carbon source during
the formation process of the CDs.

(4) Another IL ([C4mim]Cl)
was adopted as the modifier, and two inorganic acids (HBr and H2SO4) were adopted as the accelerator to prepare
CDs through the one-step method. The experimental results showed that
only very weak fluorescence of the CDs without acids (H2SO4/HBr) could be observed, but strong blue emission could
be generated with H2SO4/HBr similar to that
with HCl; when [C4mim]Cl was used instead of [C4mim]Br, the CDs with strong PL could also be obtained (Figure S4). On the other hand, all CDs prepared
with acids have optimal excitation/emission wavelengths (Figure S4) and QYs (Table S2) similar to CDs-0.96. Consequently, we can conclude that
the H+ cation works as the accelerator instead of the anions
of acids (Cl–, SO4–, and Br–) and that [C4mim]+ cations of ILs work as the modifier instead of anions (Cl–/Br–).



Figure 8 UV–vis absorption
and fluorescence excitation/emission spectra
of the CDs prepared without and with (a) HCl, (b) PEG2000N, and (c) [C4mim]Br.

In summary, the above results show that during the formation
process
of CDs, PEG2000N works as the carbon source, H+ as the accelerator, and [C4mim]+ as the modifier,
which is consistent with the formation mechanism deduced by the FTIR
spectra in Figure 4. H+ accelerates the formation of the −COOH/–OH
groups on the original CDs and then enhances their functionalization
degree, which improves subsequently the PL performance of the CDs.

Conclusions
Herein, we have successfully synthesized novel
CDs using PEG2000N as the carbon source, [C4mim]Br as the modifier,
and HCl as the accelerator. The as-prepared CDs exhibit down-conversion
and up-conversion fluorescence properties and could disperse in both
water and organic solvents, which could enlarge their application
fields. Meanwhile, the prepared CDs also had the highest QY compared
with other CDs prepared from PEG as the carbon source, and they can
also exhibit strong PL under strong acidic condition. Some control
experiments confirmed that the H+ cation in acids works
as the accelerator to enhance the PL performance of the as-prepared
CDs. This work provides a novel method for effectively improving the
performance of CDs.
