A new experimental
procedure to calculate all equilibrium constants
of the multistate of species of anthocyanins and related compounds,
including those in basic medium, is reported. The procedure is based
on a series of pH jumps monitored by stopped flow from an extended
pH range of solutions at pseudo-equilibrium (when there is no significant
formation of trans-chalcones) or at equilibrium to
pH = 1.0. The experimental procedure is described for the anthocyanin
model compound 4′-hydroxyflavylium, which exhibits a peculiar
behavior in moderately acidic medium, because the quinoidal base,
hemiketal, and cis-chalcone have similar mole fractions
at pseudo-equilibrium, permitting good discrimination among these
species. The experimental procedure can be extended to the copigmentation
phenomenon and allow the calculation of the 1:1 copigmentation constants
of the flavylium cation, quinoidal base, hemiketal, and cis- and trans-chalcones (this last from the equilibrium)
and their respective ionized forms. The method was applied to calculate
the copigmentation constants of the model compound 4′-hydroxyflavylium
as well as malvidin-3-glucoside with caffeine. In the last compound,
the strongest interaction takes place with the quinoidal base (K = 303 M–1) and flavylium cation (K = 134 M–1) and, to a lesser extent,
with the ionized quinoidal base (K = 43 M–1) and cis-chalcone (K = 17 M–1). The caffeine interaction with the hemiketal and
the other ionized species is negligible.

1 Introduction
The wide range of colors in the plant kingdom (e.g., flowers, vegetable,
and fruits) results from the great structural diversity of natural
pigments and, in particular, anthocyanins.1,2 These
water-soluble pigments are responsible for the red, blue, and violet
colors in many plants and food products derived from them. In addition
to the structural diversity, anthocyanins are present in aqueous solutions
in a very complex network of equilibrium forms, with different colors,
which are directly affected by several factors such as pH and also
complexation with metals and other compounds (copigmentation phenomena).3−5Scheme 1 summarizes
the different chemical species interconverted by means of pH changes
(from here on designated as multistate) of malvidin-3-glucoside (oenin),
the most abundant pigment in red Vitis vinifera grapes and wines.

Scheme 1 Multistate of Malvidin-3-Glucoside (Oenin)
At sufficiently acidic medium,
flavylium cation, AH+, is the only stable
species because the system converges to this species (see red arrows); k2 and k3 refer to
the rate constants of the kinetic steps observed in moderately acidic
solutions after direct pH jumps (see below). This complex system is
reduced to a simple triprotic acid AH+ in
equilibrium with the conjugate bases CB, ([A] + [B] +
[Cc] + [Ct]), CB– ([A–] + [B–] + [Cc–] + [Ct–]), and CB2– ([B2–] + [Cc2–] + [Ct2–]). At relatively high concentrations of [OH–],
the di-ionized species are formed directly from the hydroxylation
of A after a direct pH jump. The di-ionized species in
common anthocyanins are not stable.

In spite
of its complexity, the system can be dramatically simplified,
and all equilibrium constants can be calculated. In this work, we
report a mathematical approach and an experimental procedure that
permits accomplishment of this objective.

At sufficiently acidic
medium, the flavylium cation (AH+) is the
sole observed species. The other components
of the multistate appear at higher pH values. A convenient way to
study the system is to carry out direct pH jumps, defined by the addition
of a base to acidic solutions, generally at pH = 1.0, and reverse
pH jumps that are performed by addition of an acid to equilibrated
solutions at higher pH values. As the distribution of the multistate
species is dependent on the pH, after the pH jump, the system is out
of the new equilibrium, and the respective relaxation processes give
crucial information that permits characterization of the multistate
(Scheme 1). Most of
the kinetic steps take place in the timescale of seconds and subseconds,
and stopped flow is an indispensable tool to take into account for
the study of anthocyanins and related compounds.

The sequence
of reversible reactions in acidic medium reported
in Scheme 1 from the
first to the second row (from AH+ to CB) was firmly established after the work of Brouillard and
Dubois,6,7 who made a breakthrough when they discovered
that the quinoidal base (A) does not hydrate in acidic
medium. Within other relevant contributions, McClelland and co-workers
have rationalized the kinetics of the synthetic flavylium compounds
in which the role played by trans-chalcone (Ct) in the multistate in particular was concerned.8,9 In a direct pH jump, the first species to be formed is A, a process that occurs during the mixing time of the stopped flow.
The subsequent kinetic steps are much slower than proton transfer,
and consequently AH+ and A behave
as a single species. The faster observed kinetics is constituted by
two reactions: hydration of the flavylium cation (in equilibrium with
the quinoidal base) to give a hemiketal (B) followed
by ring opening (tautomerization) that leads to cis-chalcone (Cc). In the pH range accessed by direct pH
jumps, the hydration occurs in several minutes, while the tautomerization
occurs in subseconds. This makes the hydration the rate-determining
step of this kinetic step (k2 in Scheme 1). The system equilibrates
through the slowest cis—trans isomerization to give trans-chalcone (k3 in Scheme 1). The pseudo-equilibrium is defined by the transient state where
all species are in equilibrium before significant formation of Ct; see Scheme 1. The existence of the pseudo-equilibrium presupposes that the isomerization
is always the slowest step of the multistate including the case of
the ionized species. In some other flavylium-based multistates, the cis—trans isomerization is not the
slowest kinetic step, and different mathematical expressions to account
for the respective kinetic steps have been reported.10

In spite of the fact that most of the studies regarding
anthocyanins
have been carried out in acidic medium (because common anthocyanins
are not stable in basic medium), there are many and interesting exceptions,
for example, the morning glory anthocyanin,11−13 oaklins,14 pyranoanthocyanins, and their respective derivatives15 as well as many synthetic flavylium compounds,16 which imply the extension of the experimental
work to basic medium. In some flavylium-based multistates, it was
reported that after a direct pH jump in basic medium, there is hydroxylation
of the quinoidal base that leads directly to the mono- and di-ionized
species without passing through the flavylium cation.10

In this work, we profited from the recent rationalization
of a
simple experimental procedure that allows the determination of the
mole fraction distribution of the anthocyanin multistate of species.17 The new experimental approach and the respective
mathematical model here developed were applied to 4′-hydroxyflavylium
and malvidin-3-glucoside (oenin). The former was chosen because it
is very stable even in more basic medium and possesses at moderately
acidic pH values similar mole fractions of the quinoidal base and cis- and trans-chalcones, an ideal situation
to check the discrimination capacity of the model.

The approach
is based on a set of reverse pH jumps followed by
stopped flow. Reverse pH jumps were previously used but only recently
in a more systematic way.8,17 In the appendixes in
the Supporting Information, the straightforward
deduction of the mathematical expressions used through this work is
presented. The procedure was extended to the copigmentation phenomenon
in the presence of caffeine. Caffeine was chosen as a copigment model
because it is a natural compound, exhibiting the same chemical structure
in a wide range of pH values, and has been described by many authors
as having a high affinity for complexing with anthocyanins.3,18

2 Results and Discussion
The experimental procedure
was applied to the compound 4′-hydroxyflavylium
and subsequently to the anthocyanin oenin in the presence and absence
of caffeine as a copigment.

The equilibrium of 4′-hydroxyflavylium
in acidic medium
takes a long time to be reached,19 and
the species quinoidal base, hemiketal, and cis-chalcone
have similar mole fraction distributions at pseudo-equilibrium, an
ideal situation to test the model response to the copigmentation with
different species of the multistate.

2.1 4′-Hydroxyflavylium
in the Absence
of Copigment
The species observed in the case of 4′-hydroxyflavylium
are represented in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Multistate of Species of the Anthocyanin Model Compound
4′-Hydroxyflavylium
The set of equilibrium equations regarding the pseudo-equilibrium
in the case of 4′-hydroxyfflavylium is described from eqs 1–15.

2.1.1 First Global Acid–Base at Pseudo-Equilibrium
This is the equilibrium between the first and second rows in Scheme 2.  

This set of equations can be simplified
considering a global equilibrium involving AH+ and its apparent conjugate base CB^, eqs 4 and 5 (see Supporting Information). 4   5  

Equations 1–3 can be
described by a single acid–base
equilibrium, eq 4, with
acidity constant Ka^.

2.1.2 Second Global Acid–Base
Pseudo-Equilibrium
This equilibrium considers the second
and third rows in Scheme 2.

When the
pH reaches neutral to moderately basic values, the neutral species
can deprotonate, Scheme 2 and eqs 6 and 7. These acid–base processes can be also
simplified considering a second global deprotonation step according
to eqs 8 and 9.  with Ka^^ given by eq 10 10  

2.1.3 Third Global Acid–Base
Pseudo-Equilibrium
This equilibrium concerns the third and
fourth rows in Scheme 2.

At very basic
pH values, a second deprotonation occurs, eqs 11 and 12  and the system is simplified by eqs 13 and 14 13   14  

with 15  

The complete deduction of these equilibrium
constants is shown
in Appendix 1 in the Supporting Information.

Summarizing, the complex system reported in Scheme 2 (identical to Scheme 1) and described through eqs 1–15 is reduced to a single triprotic acid  

This is a dramatic
simplification of the complex systems of anthocyanins
and related compounds. The following mathematical treatment is based
on this interesting property of the anthocyanin multistate.

The pH-dependent absorption spectra of the model compound 4′-hydroxyflavylium
at pseudo-equilibrium are shown in Figure 1a. Representation of the absorbance as a
function of pH shows three inflection points corresponding to the
equilibrium constants of eq 4a, 8a, and 13a, (Ka^, Ka^^, and Ka^^^); see inset of Figure 1a. The mole fraction distribution
of the species that constitute this single triprotic acid, the species AH+, CB^, CB^–, and CB^2– (Figure 1b), can now be obtained
from eqs 16 and 17; see Appendix 1 in the
Supporting Information for the respective deduction. 16   17

species AH+, CB^, CB^–, and CB^2– at pseudo-equilibrium calculated from eqs 16 and 17. The precise
contribution of each species to CB, CB^ and CB^^ can only be determined by
reverse pH jumps; see below.

As shown in Appendix 1 in the
Supporting
Information, the mole fraction distribution of the 4′- hydroxyflavylium
at pseudo-equilibrium can be described in terms of the respective
equilibrium constants presented in eqs 1–15. 18   19   20   21  

Inspection of the absorption spectra of Figure 1a (corroborated by
the mole fractions of Figure 1b) shows the characteristic
absorption spectrum of the flavylium cation (red line) at very acidic
pH values. Around pH = 6, the quinoidal base is in equilibrium with
the hemiketal and cis-chalcone ([CB^] = [A] + [B] + [Cc]), (blue line). At pH = 12 (green line), the absorption is basically
due to Ct2– and a very
small contribution of B2–, ([CB^2–] = [Cc2–] + [B2–]). At pH = 9, the absorption
is due to the species that constitute CB^–, ([CB^–] = [B–] + [Cc–]) with contributions
from the neutral and di-ionized species (Figure 1b). The precise contribution of each species
to CB, CB^–, and CB^2– can only be achieved by the reverse
pH jumps; see below.

2.1.4 Reverse pH Jumps from
the Pseudo-equilibrium
The experimental procedure that permits
the calculation of all
equilibrium constants is based on the reverse pH jumps followed by
stopped flow from pseudo-equilibrium and also from equilibrium; see
below. The set of solutions used to obtain the spectra in Figure 1 (at pseudo-equilibrium)
was reverted to the flavylium cation at pH ≈ 1.

Two examples
of the traces obtained at two different pH values are shown in Figure 2. At pH = 6.45, the
pseudo-equilibrium is basically established between the species A, B, and Cc. At pH = 8.86, there
is a mixture of the mono-ionized species (B– and Cc–) with contributions
of the neutral species and also a small one from the di-ionized B2– and Cc2–. When the reverse pH jump is carried out, the ionized species are
immediately transformed into their respective neutral forms (during
the mixing time of the stopped flow), but their relative ratio is
a function of the mole fraction of the species at the starting pH
of the jump. The traces should be taken at a wavelength where the
flavylium cation is the sole absorption species, which is easy to
accomplish because the flavylium cation absorption band (450 nm) is
red-shifted in comparison with the other species.a Independent of the initial pH of the reverse pH jump, the first
absorption refers to the quinoidal bases (in this case, just one)
that are transformed into the flavylium cation during the mixing of
the stopped flow as well as the contribution from the flavylium cation
present previously in the jump at starting pH values that are more
acidic (Figure 1b).
The system evolves to the complete conversion into the flavylium cation
by two kinetic steps: (i) the faster is the conversion of the hemiketal
speciesb and (ii) the conversion of Cc species via B (Figure 2).8 Taking this data into
account, it is possible to decompose the species CB^, CB^–, and CB^2– in terms of the quinoidal base, hemiketal, and cis-chalcone components according to eqs 22–25 (Appendix 1 in the Supporting Information). 22   23   24   25  with D as
defined in eq 25 and
the mole fractions given by the coefficients a0 + b0 + c0 = 1, b1 + c1 = 1, and b2 + c2 = 1 because the amplitude of the traces should be normalized.
The coefficients an, bn, and cn are the normalized
amplitudes of the quinoidal base (and its ionized species), hemiketal
(and its ionized species), and cis-chalcone (and
its ionized species), respectively. When normalized, they are coincident
with the mole fraction of the respective species.

Figure 2 (a) Reverse pH jump from
pH = 6.45 to pH = 1 and (b) the same from
pH = 8.86. The amplitudes of the traces should be normalized in order
to have A + B + C = 1 and A + (B + B–) +
(Cc + Cc–) = 1.

The key step of the procedure
reported in this work is that the
mole fraction distributions can be described by two different sets
of equations: (i) in terms of the equilibrium constants, eqs 18–21 and (ii) in terms of the mole fractions obtained through
the reverse pH jumps, eqs 22–24.

Considering that the
term D is the same in both
representations, comparing eqs 18 and 19 with eq 22 26  

Comparing eq 20 with 23 27  and comparing eq 21 with 24 28  

In Figure 3, the
fitting with eq 16 (for AH+, CB^, CB^–, and CB^2–)
and eq 22 to eq 24 is shown. This procedure
permits achievement of the mole fractions of all species. The fitting
was achieved for the flavylium cation plus the quinoidal base, hemiketal, cis-chalcone, and respective mono- and di-ionized species
for a0 = 0.36, b0 = 0.34, b1 = 0.15, b2 = 0.08, c0 = 0.3, c1 = 0.85, and c2 = 0.92.

species at pseudo-equilibrium; flavylium cation plus quinoidal base
(violet), hemiketal and ionized hemiketal (green), and cis-chalcone and its mono and di-ionized species (orange). Fitting was
achieved with eqs 22–24 for the following parameters: a0 = 0.36, b0 = 0.34, b1 = 0.15, b2 = 0.08, c0 = 0.3, c1 = 0.85, c2 = 0.92.

According to eqs 26–28, once the equilibrium constants Ka^, Ka^^, and Ka^^^ (obtained from Figure 1 and in accordance with the fitting of Figure 3) and the coefficients an, bn, and cn are calculated, all equilibrium constants
of 4′-hydroxyflavylium as shown in Scheme 2 can be calculated (Table 1).

b Approximated
values.

Verification of
the goodness of the data can be done by recalculating
the global equilibrium constants Ka^, Ka^^, and Ka^^^ from eqs 4, 10, and 15, respectively, using
the data from Table 1.

The data from the reverse pH jumps followed by stopped flow
are
equally valid if some trans-chalcone was already
formed because the only effect is to reduce the amplitudes of the
reverse pH jumps but not their normalized values. At very basic pH
values, the plateau is achieved between an equilibrium involving Cc2– (major) and B2–(minor). The formation of this last species is only explained
by deprotonation of the OH group in position 2.

2.1.5 The Equilibrium
The equilibrium
is treated as in the case of the pseudo-equilibrium by adding the
contribution of the trans-chalcones. 29   30   31  

The system at the
equilibrium is again equivalent to a triprotic acid with the species AH+, CB, CB–, and CB2–, eqs 32–39. 32   33   34   35   36   37   38   39  

The mole fraction distribution of trans-chalcone
and its ionized species can be written as eq 40 40  with D defined
by eq 41 41  

Similar to the pseudo-equilibrium,
the mole fractions of the species AH+, CB, CB–, and CB2– are given by eqs 42 and 43 42   43  

The fact that the equilibrium in
the case of the compound 4′-hydroxyflavylium
is extremely slow was previously reported.9,20 However,
the prediction that could take years was re-evaluated since the observation
is that the cis—trans isomerization is catalyzed
in extremely acidic values.20 In Figure 4, the mole fraction
distribution of the species at the equilibrium is shown.

Figure 4 (a) Equilibrium
absorption spectra of the compound 4′-hydroxyflavylium
(2 × 10–5 M) at representative pH values: pH
= 1, flavylium cation (red); pH = 5, trans-chalcone
(blue); pH = 9, mono-ionized trans-chalcone with
contributions of the neutral and di-ionized analogues (orange); pH
= 12, di-ionized trans-chalcone (green line). (b)
Mole fraction of the trans-chalcones, eq 51, is represented by the green line,
showing that the equilibrium is established between the flavylium
cation and the trans-chalcones.

Due to the extremely slow cis—trans isomerization at pH ≈ 1, pKa′ =
3.3 is
an estimation. For higher pH values, the equilibrium is reached in
several days for pKa″ = 8.1 and pKa‴ = 9.25.
The equilibrium constants regarding trans-chalcones
are now calculated by comparison of the data from the equilibrium
and pseudo-equilibrium, eq 44; the value of Ki is obtained, eq 45. 44  

Rearranging eq 44 and substituting the
values from Table 1 45  

Rearranging eq 36 and
substituting the respective values from Table 1 46  

Finally, from eq39 47  

The mole fraction distribution of the species at equilibrium
is
given by eqs 48–51 48   49   50   51  with D defined
in eq 43.

The
mole fraction distributions of the species Ct, Ct–, and Ct2– given by eq 51 are
represented in Figure 4b (green lines). The equilibrium is basically established between
the flavylium cation and the trans-chalcones. This
precludes in this compound the use of reverse pH jumps from the equilibrium
to calculate any other species except trans-chalcones,
an alternative when the trans-chalcones are not the
sole species of CB, CB–, and CB2–.

2.2 Application of the Reverse pH Jumps to the
Copigmentation: 4′-Hydroxyflavylium in the Presence of Caffeine
The pH-dependent absorption spectra of the compound 4′-hydroxyflavylium
(1.8 × 10–5 M) in the presence of caffeine
(0.058 M) at pseudo-equilibrium are shown in Figure 5. The spectral variations are compatible
with an equilibrium between AH+, CB^, CB^–, and CB^2– and their complexes with caffeine with pKa(CP)^ = 4.1, pKa(CP)^^ = 8.8, and pKa(CP)^^^ = 9.1 (Figure 5b).

(1.8 × 10–5 M) at pseudo-equilibrium in the

pH = 6.2 (blue); absorption spectrum of CB^2– (essentially Cc2–), pH = 12 (green); the
spectrum at pH = 9 is a mixture of CB^ and CB^2– (not emphasized); inset: fitting of
the absorbance at two representative wavelengths was achieved for
pKa(CP)^ = 4.0, pKa(CP)^^ = 8.8, and pKa(CP)^^^ = 9.1. (b)
Mole fraction distribution of the species AH+, CB^, CB^–, and CB^2– at pseudo-equilibrium
calculated from eqs 16– 20.

The absorption spectra of Figure 5 are similar to those of Figure 1, but the absorption of the
quinoidal base
(blue color) is clearly higher.

The same procedure used to calculate
the equilibrium constants
in the absence of a copigment was used in the presence of caffeine.
When the reverse pH jump followed by stopped flow back to pH ≤
1 takes place from the pseudo-equilibrium, the initial amplitude is
given by the transformation of A (and its ionized species)
and the respective complexes with caffeine into AH+ and its caffeine complex (AH+–Caffeine). At lower pH values, the flavylium cation and its
complex with caffeine prior to the equilibrium also contribute to
the initial absorbance of the reverse pH jumps. The approximation
requires that the complexation with all species is labile enough to
permit the rearrangement (formation of AH+ and its complex with caffeine) during the mixing time of the stopped
flow.c The second step is the formation of more
flavylium and its respective complex from the hemiketal and its complex,
and finally, in a slower process, cis-chalcone and
its complexes give more flavylium cations (and its complex). Representation
of the three amplitudes of the reverse pH jumps in the presence of
caffeine is shown in Figure 6, and the respective equilibrium constants are shown in Table 2.

and di-ionized species (orange). Fitting was achieved respectively
with eqs 22–24 for the following parameters: a0 = 0.68, b0 = 0.12, b1 = 0.07, b2 = 0.05, c0 = 0.2, c1 = 0.93, c2 = 0.95.

Comparing Figure 3 and Figure 6, the

2.3 New Experimental
Procedure Based on Reverse
pH Jumps To Calculate All Copigmentation Constants
The anthocyanin
copigmentation has been extensively studied, and mathematical models
to account for this phenomenon have been reported.21−24 The copigmentation with a flavylium
cation can be straightforwardly studied at pH ≤ 1 because it
is the only species in solution. However, when higher pH values are
used, the system becomes very complex due to the existence of more
species in competition. A copigmentation model that considers the
interaction with the flavylium cation and quinoidal base was published,19 but extension of this model to copigmentation
with more species is not possible due to the number of variables to
be fitted.

Here, we describe an alternative based on the reverse
pH jumps from the pseudo-equilibrium that permits the calculation
of the total fraction of flavylium cations (and its complexes including
those of high stoichiometry), and the same was done for the quinoidal
base, hemiketal, and cis-chalcone. In the case of
the trans-chalcone, the measurements should be made
at equilibrium. We restricted the calculations of the copigmentation
with the flavylium cation and the neutral (CB^) and the
mono-ionized species (CB^–) because
it is the interesting pH range in the case of anthocyanins. Moreover,
the calculations were made for 1:1 complexation. The interaction of
the flavylium cation and trans-chalcone of 4′-hydroxyflavylium
with caffeine fits the 1:1 requirement (see Figure 7), with the existence of isosbestic points.
In the case of the interaction of the flavylium cation with caffeine,
the system is not strictly 1:1 (Figure 10), but a good fitting with a 1:1 stoichiometry
was obtained, and the respective constant equal to 134 M–1 can be considered a good approximation.

Figure 7 (a) Spectral variations
of the model compound 4′-hydroxyflavylium
(1.8 × 10–5M) in the presence of added concentrations
of the copigment caffeine at pH = 1.0; KAH+CP = 18 M–1. (b) Spectral variations
of the trans-chalcone ( from model compound 4'-hydroxyflavylium
)
in the presence of added concentrations of caffeine at pH = 6.0, KCtCP = 47 M–1. The spectral variations are
compatible with a 1:1 complex.

Comparing the data from Figure 3 and Figure 6, the following equations can be deduced as shown in Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information 52  where a0(CP) and Ka(CP)^ are the mole faction distribution and
global constant, respectively, as above in the presence of the copigment.

Substituting KAH+CP obtained
at pH = 1 in eq 52 gives KACP since Ka was
previously obtained in the absence of caffeine.

Regarding hemiketal
species, the procedure is mutatis mutandis the same
above 53   54  

From eq 53 and the
data of Table 1, KBCP is calculated. On the other hand, from eq 54 and Table 1, the acid base constant KBCP/BCP– is calculated as
well as the copigmentation constant of the ionized species with the
hemiketal (KB–CP) due
to the relation shown in eq 55 55  

Using an identical
procedure for the cis-chalcone 56   57   58  

In conclusion, if KAH+CP is known, the reverse pH jumps in the presence and absence of the
copigment permit the calculation of all copigmentation constants of
the system except those of trans-chalcone.

2.3.1 Copigmentation of 4′-Hydroxyflavylium
with Caffeine at pH = 1.0 (Calculation of KAH+CP)
In order to apply the present procedure
to the copigmentation of 4′-hydroxyflavylium with caffeine
and get the respective copigmentation constant KAH+CP, the absorption spectra were collected after
titration with different concentrations of caffeine at pH 1 (Figure 7). The respective
association constant KAH+CP = 18 M–1 was calculated through the fitting of Af and KAH+CP by means of eq 59.d 59  where A0 and Af are the
initial and final
absorbance, respectively. In this case, the final absorbance cannot
be reached, limited by the caffeine solubility and the relatively
small value of the copigmentation constant.

As shown above,
the data from Figure 7 and eqs 52–58 allow the calculation of the copigmentation constants
with A, B, and Cc (Table 3).

2.3.2 Equilibrium
of 4′-Hydroxyflavylium
in the Presence of Caffeine
The equilibrium absorption spectra
at representative pH values, together with the respective mole fraction
distribution of the species AH+, CB, CB–, and CB2–, are shown in Figure 8. Three inflection points when the absorbance is represented
as a function of pH give the equilibrium constants pKa′ =
3.15, pKa″ = 7.8, and pKa‴ = 10.2.
When Figure 8 is compared
with Figure 4, it is
clear that in the absence of caffeine, CB is basically
equal to Ct and in the presence of caffeine, there is
a significant fraction of the quinoidal base (A). This
permits us to conclude that A possesses a copigmentation
constant strong enough to shift the equilibrium from Ct to A.

Figure 8 (a) Equilibrium absorption spectra of 4′-hydroxyflavylium
(1.8 × 10–5 M) in the presence of caffeine
(0.058 M) at representative pH values: pH = 1, flavylium cation (red);
pH = 5.6, CB (blue); pH = 9.3, CB–, with contributions of CB and CB2– (orange); pH = 12, di-ionized trans-chalcone
(green line). (b) Mole fraction of the trans-chalcones, eq 51, is represented by the
green line, showing that the equilibrium is established between the
flavylium cation and the trans-chalcones. pKa′ = 3.15, pKa″ = 7.8, and pKa‴ = 10.2.

The generalization to the equilibrium
(adding the terms that correspond
to Ct) is straightforward. 60  and 61   62  

Considering that K(CP)′ is an experimental value, the
parameter Ka′(CP) is obtained because KAH+CP was previously calculated in Figure 7a. On the other hand, eq 62 permits calculation
of KCtCP (Table 3).

2.3.3 Application
to Malvidin-3-Glucoside (Oenin)
The model established before
for 4′-hydroxyflavylium was
applied to an abundant natural anthocyanin, malvidin-3-glucoside (oenin).

We observed that in the pH range ∼7 < pH < 9, the
hydration becomes slower than isomerization, and the kinetics upon
a direct pH jump to this range is monoexponential (hydration control).
Such an effect was previously reported for cyanidin-3-glucoside.18 Moreover, for pH > 7, the equilibrium cannot
be well defined because some decomposition takes place, yellow band
in Figure 9. In the
direct pH jumps up to pH = 6, the kinetics is biexponential with the
pH-independent slowest rate constant (isomerization) equal to 0.0004
s–1. The rate and equilibrium constants were determined
following the established procedure,7,16 and the respective
values are reported in Table 4. These values are in good agreement with those previously
reported except for Kt. As reported previously,25 the measurement of Kt in the case of oenin and other monoglucosides has some uncertainty.
The present value was obtained after 13 different measurements in
the pH range of the neutral species.

Figure 9 (a) Mole fraction distribution of malvidin-3-glucoside
in the absence
of the copigment obtained by reverse pH jumps from the pseudo-equilibrium.
Fitting was achieved for a0 = 0.06, b0 = 0.67, and c0 = 0.27 for the neutral species and a1 = 1, b1 = 0, and c1 = 0. This last set of parameters regarding the ionized species
is an estimation because of the slow decomposition processes. (b)

of caffeine (0.058 M). a0 = 0.42, b0 = 0.38, and c0 = 0.2 for the neutral species and a1 = 1, b1 = 0, and c1 = 0. For pH > 7, the pseudo-equilibrium and equilibrium
are
not well defined due to decomposition and the fact that hydration
becomes slower than isomerization. Only for more basic pH values does
the hydroxyl attack increase the rate of the hydration, but at these
pH values, this anthocyanin is very unstable.

The interaction of anthocyanins
with caffeine was previously reported
in the literature.3,18,25,27,27 In Table 5, the respective constants
in water are shown.

b 1:1 stoichiometry.

c 1:2
stoichiometry.

The mathematical
procedure used throughout this work, similar to
most of the copigmentation models widely used in the literature, is
deduced for a 1:1 complexation. In particular, the copigmentation
constant of malvin previously described25 (Table 5) was calculated
with this 1:1 assumption. However, it is known from the literature
that in anthocyanins, this requirement is not strictly observed.18,25 In the case of oenin, the titration of the flavylium cation at pH
= 1 by addition of caffeine (Figure 10a) shows that the
isosbestic point is not maintained. Nevertheless, a good fitting considering
a 1:1 stoichiometry with a constant of 134 M–1 (Figure 10b) was achieved,
and consequently this is a reasonable approximation to interpret in
a semiquantitative perspective the effect of the caffeine copigmentation.
Moreover, it allows the comparison with other copigmentation constants
reported in the literature obtained within the same approximation.
The present mathematical approach, just like the other models published,
does not take into account the self-aggregation of the anthocyanin.
However, this phenomenon is minimized by the low anthocyanin concentrations
used throughout this work.e,16,28

Figure 10 (a) Spectral variations of malvidin-3-glucoside (1.7 × 10−5) at pH = 1.0 as a function of caffeine addition;
(b) fitting was achieved for a 1:1 stoichiometry (KAH+CP = 134 M–1)

According to Figure 8 and Table 5, the
colored species of oenin are those interacting strongly with caffeine,
and the greater copigmentation effect takes place with the quinoidal
base, as was observed for 4′-hydroxyflavylium. The interaction
of caffeine with the ionized species is negligible except for the
ionized quinoidal base. Since in this pH range, there is no competition
of the ionized quinoidal base for the interaction with caffeine, the
complex of the ionized quinoidal base is the dominant species, and
the color of the solution around neutrality is essentially blue.

3 Conclusions
The study of complex systems
involving anthocyanins and related
compounds has become very accessible through the experimental procedure
reported in this work. Not only can all equilibrium constants of the
anthocyanin multistate of species be measured, but also all copigmentation
constants of the multistate are obtained when the experiments are
made in the presence of a copigment and compared with those in its
absence. This work confirms in a quantitative way that caffeine interacts
preferentially with quinoidal bases and in particular has a negligible
interaction with the hemiketal, which in most anthocyanins is the
major species in moderately acidic medium.

These achievements
are very important because they greatly contribute
to better clarifying the color stability of the anthocyanin in aqueous
solution and to understanding the physicochemical mechanisms behind
the effects of copigmentation present in many natural systems that
are responsible for the stabilization of color in the plants and foods
derived from them such as jams, red fruit drinks, wines, and so on.

4 Materials and Methods
The flavylium compound 4′-hydroxyflavylium
was synthesized
as described in ref (9). Malvidin-3-glucoside (oenin) was extracted from young red wine
(V. vinifera L. cv. Touriga Nacional)
by semipreparative chromatography using a reversed-phase C18 column
(250 mm 4.6 mm i.d.), as described elsewhere.29

Stock solutions of 4′-hydroxyflavylium (1.2 ×
10–3 M) in 0.1 M HCl, malvidin-3-glucoside (1.2
×
10–3 M) in 0.1 M HCl, caffeine (0.1 M, Alfa Aesar
Co. Ltd.) in Theorell and Stenhagen’s universal buffer (pH
7), and caffeine (0.1 M) in water were prepared. For the calculation
of pKa^, pKa′, and pKa values of the ionized forms, direct pH jumps kinetics were monitored
after mixing the flavylium stock solution, NaOH to neutralize the
amount of HCl added, buffer at desired pH (with and without caffeine),
and water (or 0.1 M caffeine in water). Reverse pH jumps were performed,
adding enough HCl (with or without caffeine) to equilibrated or pseudo-equilibrated
solutions to reach pH = 1. pH was recorded on a Radiometer Copenhagen
PHM240 pH/ion meter (Brønshøj, Denmark).

UV–vis
spectra were recorded on a Varian-Cary 100 Bio or
a 5000 spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA, USA). The reverse pH jumps
from pseudo-equilibrium were monitored on an SX20 (Applied Photophysics;
Surrey, UK) spectrometer equipped with a PDA.1/UV photodiode array
detector. A filter of 435 nm was used to prevent the photochemical
reactions that could take place from Cc or B.

a The quinoidal base is even more red-shifted
than the flavylium cation but protonates immediately to give this
last one in the final pH values of the reverse pH jump.

b At very acidic pH values, the hydration
becomes faster than tautomerization (change of regime).

c This is corroborated by NMR because
only a single peak of each species and the respective complex with
caffeine appears in accordance with a fast exchange rate.

d The use of the Benesi–Hildebrand
equation is another alternative.

e In the case of NMR measurements, higher
concentrations are usually needed.
