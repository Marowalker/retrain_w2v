Strain-engineered
two-dimensional (2D) SiGe is predicted to be
a topological insulator (TI) based on first-principle calculations.
The dynamical and thermal stabilities were ascertained through phonon
spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. 2D SiGe remains
dynamically stable under tensile strains of 4 and 6%. A band inversion
was observed at the Γ-point with a band gap of 25 meV for 6%
strain due to spin–orbit coupling interactions. Nontrivial
of the TI phase was determined by its topological invariant (υ
= 1). For SiGe nanoribbon with edge states, the valence band and conduction
band cross at the Γ-point to create a topologically protected
Dirac cone inside the bulk gap. We found that hexagonal boron nitride
(h-BN) with high dielectric constant and band gap can be a very stable
support to experimentally fabricate 2D SiGe as the h-BN layer does
not alter its nontrivial topological character. Unlike other heavy-metal-based
2D systems, because SiGe has a sufficiently large gap, it can be utilized
for spintronics and quantum spin Hall-based applications under ambient
condition.

1 Introduction
Topological
insulators (TIs) are novel quantum spin Hall (QSH)
insulators that are characterized by boundary states within a bulk
insulating gap and maintain time-reversal symmetry due to spin–orbit
coupling (SOC).1−4 Thus, the low-energy scattering of the edge states is robust by
time-reversal symmetry, which leads to dissipationless transport edge
channels. TIs have many potential applications, such as in spintronics
and quantum devices.5 TI phase in graphene
has been predicted due to very weak spin–orbital coupling (SOC)
that opens a gap at the Dirac point.6 In
the last decade, several new two-dimensional (2D) TIs have been theoretically
predicted and also experimentally confirmed mostly in elements with
strong spin–orbit coupling.7−11 However, these materials have very small bulk band gaps and hence
experimental observation of a QSH insulator has been rather difficult
other than at ultralow temperature. Consequently, there is a strong
interest to search and design suitable 2D TIs at the normal temperature
with large bulk gaps. Very recently, theoretical calculations have
predicted 2D TIs phase.12−32 Unfortunately, most of these theoretically predicted structures
would be extremely difficult for translating into devices due to the
presence of the heavy atoms, which are known to be toxic. Among these
systems, Bi4Br4 and ZrTe5/HfTe5 appear to be highly promising because they exist as layered
crystals and have significant band gaps. Also, IV–VI 2D materials
seem attractive as calculations indicate TI in their rocksalt structures.33−36

To design a large-band-gap two-dimensional topological nontrivial
phase, different techniques have been utilized to achieve QSH effect.
One widely used approach is applying a perpendicular external electric
field, that is, applying an electric field to multilayers of black
phosphorus to convert it from a normal insulator (NI) to TI. The nontrivial
phase originates from the external electric field, whereas SOC opens
the band gap at the Dirac cone to realize TI phase.31 Strain modification is another approach for switching a
NI in TI.37,38 Furthermore, low-buckled silicene and germanene
also show QSH effect and band inversion due to the effect of spin–orbit
coupling.39

Herein, using density
functional theory, we predicted that 2D SiGe
undergoes phase transition from NI to TI under a strain of 6%. The
dynamical stability of SiGe was proven by phonon dispersion calculations.
The band structures and the parity of occupied bands under strain
confirmed trivial and nontrivial topological phases before and after
the band inversion, respectively. The gapless bands of the topological
edge states are achieved within a zigzag nanoribbon (with L = 8.837 nm) of SiGe. Most interestingly, hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) is shown as an excellent substrate for supporting 2D
SiGe and yet preserving its nontrivial topological phase. Hence, SiGe/h-BN
is predicted as a room-temperature TI for QSH phase applications.

2 Computational Details
All calculations were carried
out using the Vienna ab initio simulation
package (VASP).40 The exchange-correlation
term was described within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
parameterized by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.
Vacuum region was set as 20 Å along z-direction
of the sheets to minimize the interaction between the monolayers using
periodic boundary conditions. Kinetic energy cutoff for plane-wave
expansion was 500 eV. Atoms in the unit cell are relaxed until the
force per atom falls below 0.001 eV/Å. A 11 × 11 ×
1 Monkhorst–Pack41k-point mesh is used to sample the Brillouin zone. The modified tensile
strain is described as ε = Δa/ao, where ao is the
equilibrium lattice and Δa + ao is the strained-modified lattice. Spin−orbit
coupling (SOC) effect was included consistently up to the second-order
(LS coupling).42 The phonon spectra were
implemented by the PHONOPY code43 using
density functional perturbation theory method in VASP. Molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations were carried out to determine the room-temperature
stability of 2D SiGe. MD simulation was achieved for 10 ps with a
time step of 1.0 fs at T = 300 and 500 K.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Dynamical Stability and
Electronic Structures
The 2D SiGe monolayer has an out-of-plane
puckered geometry within
a hexagonal structure, in which the height of buckling, Si–Ge
bond length, and bond angle (θ) are 0.58, 2.36 Å, and 113.9°,
respectively, as shown in Figure 1a (see Table ST1). We have
previously shown that doping of silicene with Ge atoms increases its
buckling height to about 0.69 Å, and also the lattice constant
increases with increasing doping concentrations in agreement with
Vegard’s law.44 Interestingly, 2D
SiGe has two polymorphic forms: (i) phase-separated lattice, in which
the Si and Ge atoms are localized in opposite sides. This form shows
quantum confinement and band offset for nanowires.45,46 (ii) Honeycomb lattices for which Si and Ge are alternatively bonded,
as shown in Figure 1a. The total energies are compared without and with SOC at different
strains, as shown in Figure 1b. The dynamical stability of 2D SiGe was confirmed by the
absence of imaginary frequencies in their phonon dispersions.

The computed phonon dispersions for tensile strains
of 4 and 6%
corresponding to the cases prior and subsequent to band inversion
are shown in Figure 1c,d respectively. Absences of imaginary frequencies indicate that
the SiGe monolayer at 4 and 6% strains was dynamically stable. The
thermal stability of 2D SiGe was further investigated by performing
ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. We utilized a sufficiently
large 4 × 4 supercell for thermal equilibration. After heating
at 300 and 500 K for 10 ps with a time step of 1 fs, we observed no
structural reconstruction, indicating that 2D SiGe is thermally robust.
The snapshots of atomic configurations of 2D SiGe structure for MD
simulation with a time step of 1 fs at T = 300 and
500 K are reported in Figure S1, and the
corresponding total energy, average bond length, and temperature fluctuation
with time during the simulation are illustrated in Figure 2a–c. The average Si–Ge
bond length is 2.41 Å and average dihedral angle ⟨ϕ⟩
is 42° (cf. ⟨ϕ⟩ ≈ 47.1° at 0
K for GGA–PBE calculations), which clearly indicate that the
2D SiGe remains thermally stable at room temperature (i.e., T = 300 K).

3.2 Band Structures of Strain-Modified SiGe
The electronic band structures of 2D SiGe can be tuned through
an external tensile strain as plotted in Figure 3a–h without and with SOC. This is
indeed gratifying considering that doping with Ge atoms does not alter
the band gap in silicene.44 As shown in Figure 3a,e without and with
SOC, respectively, the π and π* bands cross the Fermi
level at the Γ-point. The Fermi level is dominated mainly by
the pz atomic orbitals of Si and Ge atoms.
Analogous Dirac cones at K point have been observed
in pristine silicene, germanene, and graphene. The origin of the band
gap in 2D SiGe was the effect of hybridization of the orbitals under
strain with SOC. Because of strain, bands gaps of 47 and 89 meV are
observed without SOC for ε = 2 and 4%, respectively, at Γ-point,
as presented in Figure 3b,c. When SOC is considered, band gaps of 28 and 69 meV are observed
at the Γ-point for ε = 2 and 4%, respectively, as shown
in Figure 3f,g. Clearly,
even a small tensile strain (ε = 2–4%) is sufficient
to open the band gaps at Γ-point. As shown in Figure 3d, at ε = 6% without
SOC, the valance band and conduction band (CB) come close to each
other at Γ-point, thereby demonstrating a semimetal behavior.
We then turn on the SOC, which lifts the degeneracy of orbitals, resulting
in an indirect band gap of 25 meV. This causes the nature of the wave
function of the valence band (VB) and CB to invert, as shown in Figure 3h. Therefore, the
observation of “m” shape in the VB at the Γ-point
for 6% strain arises entirely due to SOC.

Figure 3 Band structures without
and with SOC, respectively, at (a, e) 0%
strain, (b, f) 2% strain, (c, g) 4% strain, and (d, h) 6% strain in
2D SiGe. K (1/3, 1/3, 0), Γ (0, 0, 0), M (1/2, 0, 0), and K (1/3, 1/3, 0) refer
to special points in the first 2D Brillouin zone in reciprocal space.

To further understand the electronic
properties, the partial density
of states of 2D SiGe is also computed under different tensile strains,
as shown in Figure S4. Interestingly, both
the maximum of valance band and the minimum of conduction band get
localized and charge-transfer states are observed. Evidently, s-orbital
crosses the Fermi level as the tensile strain increases and the pz orbital is lifted to the conduction band as
a result of SOC. Further increase in strain to 6% makes the s-orbital
lower in energy than the pz orbital, as
observed by projecting the density of states and bands onto different
atomic orbitals. This explains the inversion of the s–p orbitals
under the tensile strain due to the presence of SOC, as presented
in Figure 5e–h.

We now focus on optical spectra because the dielectric function
depends on the electron band structure of the crystal. The origins
of optical transitions are traced to core excitation from valance
band to high-energy conduction band. The prominent optical transitions
are obtained at 7.83, 8.02, 8.12, and 8.23 eV for ε = 0, 2,
4, and 6%, respectively, as shown in Figure 4 for the polarization of light perpendicular
to the SiGe monolayer. Clearly, the absorption spectrum is blue-shifted
with increased tensile strain vis-à-vis unstrained SiGe.

ε = 0% (black line), ε = 2% (red line), ε = 4% (blue
line), and ε = 6% (green line). Note that the polarization of
light is perpendicular to 2D SiGe monolayers.

3.3 Nontrivial Topological Phase in Strain-Modified
SiGe
To unambiguously determine the nontrivial topological
features of 2D SiGe, we investigated the topological Z2 invariant (ν) during band inversion and prior
to it. At a strain of 6%, we find the Z2 invariant ν = 0 (trivial phase) without SOC and ν =
1 (nontrivial phase) with SOC. We have used the parity criteria predicted
by Fu and Kane;1−3 the presence of inversion symmetry helps calculate
the Z2 parameter directly from the parities
of eight occupied bands. For SiGe, there are four time-reversal invariant
momenta (TRIM) points in the 2D Brillouin zone, one Γ-point
and three M points (see Figure S4). The Z2 topological invariant,
ν, is calculated as  where δ(Ki) is the product of parity
eigenvalues at TRIM points,
ξ = ±1 denotes parity eigenvalues, and N is number of the occupied bands. The parities of eight occupied
bands at time-reversal momenta are shown in Figure 5a,b. When 6% strain was applied without SOC, SiGe behaves
as a semimetal, as presented in Figure 5c. The s-orbital touches the Fermi level and the pz orbital dominates the valence band maximum
(VBM), as shown in Figure 5e,f.

(b) nontrivial
state for 6% strain with SOC. Band structure (c) without SOC and (d)

minimum (CBM) without SOC, (f) VBM without SOC, (g) CBM with SOC,
and (h) VBM with SOC. The isosurface refers to isovalues of 2.279
× 10–3 electrons/bohr3.

In the presence of SOC, the band inversion observed,
as presented
in Figure 5d, switches
normal insulator to topological insulator as a result of strain increasing
the greater hybridization of atomic orbitals (s, px, py, pz), as shown in Figure 5g,h. Consequently, SiGe undergoes trivial to nontrivial phase transition
as the strain is increased to 6% in presence of SOC. We have verified
the parities of occupied bands of SiGe, which proves a nontrivial
phase (ν = 1). The products of the parity eigenvalues at the
Γ and M points are +1 and −1, respectively,
for 6% strain. When strain is applied without SOC, the calculated Z2 topological invariant is a trivial phase (ν
= 0), topologically speaking.

Additionally, for 2D SiGe as topological
insulator, a unique property
is the presence of a single of Dirac-like edge state (one-dimensional
gapless edge) within the bulk gap. For further understanding the nature
of nontrivial TI at ε = 6%, we analyze the existence of edge
states. A symmetric edge within a zigzag nanoribbon is constructed,
and the dangling bonds at the edges were passivated by hydrogen atoms.
The width of the SiGe nanoribbon is 8.837 nm, which is sufficiently
large to avoid electron correlations between the two edges on either
ends, as shown Figure 6a. We explicitly recognize that the Dirac-like edge states (green
lines) cross at the Γ-point linearly within the bulk gap, thereby
confirming unequivocally the existence of a topologically nontrivial
phase at ε = 6% strain with SOC, as shown in Figure 6b.

ε = 6%. The edge is passivated by H atoms. (b) Electronic band

states (green lines) can be clearly seen within the bulk gap). (c)

Band structure of SiGe deposited on h-BN substrate with 6% SOC strain.

To have practical application
as an electronic device, pristine
forms of silicene and germanene are too unstable and air-sensitive.
Therefore, monoatomic 2D layers of Si and Ge are typically deposited
on substrates. Recently, experimental syntheses of hydrogenated graphene,47 germanene,48−50 and silicene51−55 have been successfully undertaken on various substrates. Hence,
it is imperative that the topological nontrivial phase has to be fabricated
over substrates for their eventual experimental observation. h-BN
monolayer is a large-band-gap insulator with Eg = 4.6 eV with a high dielectric constant and has been experimentally
well characterized as a substrate.56−59 Therefore, we choose h-BN as
a substrate support for 2D SiGe monolayer. The lattice mismatch between
SiGe and h-BN is quite small (Δ = 0.04 Å), and the interlayer
distance, dSiGe/h-BN = 4.12 Å,
results in a stable van der Waals heterostructure. The binding energy
is 0.02 eV per unit cell, which again confirms the weak interaction
between SiGe and h-BN monolayer, as presented in Figure 6c. Interestingly, the band
structure for SiGe/h-BN as shown in Figure 6d, which clearly indicates that the “m”-shape
of the valance band at the Γ-point for ε = 6% remains
unperturbed. Therefore, there is no charge transfer between the h-BN
and SiGe monolayer, which is also supported from the Bader charge
analyses.

Generally, most of the 2D TIs predicted to date are
with heavy
metals, which have strong SOC effects, including Pb, Hg, Sn, Sb, and
Bi. Although, in some light elements, QSH effect has also been observed,
the very small gaps induced by SOC are insignificant for thermally
mobilizing the edge states. For example, the gaps are ∼10–3 meV for graphene,60,61 silicene (1.55–2.9
meV),39 germanene (Eg = 23.9–108 meV),29,32,39 arsenene (Eg = 696 meV),13 and few-layered phosphorene (Eg = 1.5–2.2 eV).31

In this context, we predicted the 2D SiGe band gap of 25 meV at
ε = 6%. Interestingly, the gap for SiGe is also comparable to
thermal energy at room temperature.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have predicted a new 2D TIs for SiGe through tensile
strain engineering. The absence of imaginary frequency at 6% strain
indicates dynamical stability. Thermal stability for the SiGe monolayer
is also confirmed by ab initio MD at 300 K. A band inversion has been
observed at the Γ-point at ε = 6% due to spin–orbit
coupling interaction, which opens a significant band gap of 25 meV.
The nontrivial phase was additionally verified by the topological Z2 invariant, υ = 1. The topologically
protected edge states in SiGe nanoribbon cross at the Γ-point
inside the bulk gap. We also predict that hexagonal boron nitride
(h-BN) with high dielectric constant and large band gap acts as an
ideal substrate to support SiGe for the experimental detection of
its topological nontrivial phase. Also, the absence of heavy-metal
atoms and significant topological gap makes 2D SiGe an excellent candidate
for exploring its TI property.
