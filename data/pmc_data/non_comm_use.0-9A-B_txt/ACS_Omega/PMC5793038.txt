Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic
used for the treatment
of serious infections by Gram-positive pathogens. Vancomycin inhibits
cell wall biosynthesis by targeting the d-Ala-d-Ala
terminus of peptidoglycan (PG). The highly cross-linked heptapeptide
aglycon structure of vancomycin is the d-Ala-d-Ala
binding site. The first residue of vancomycin is N-methyl-leucine, which is crucial for the dipeptide binding. The
removal of N-methyl-leucine by Edman degradation
results in desleucyl-vancomycin devoid of antimicrobial activities.
To investigate the function of N-methyl-leucine for
the dipeptide binding in vancomycin, molecular dynamics simulations
of vancomycin and three N-terminus-modified vancomycin derivatives:
desleucyl-vancomycin, vancomycinNtoC, and vancomycinSar, binding to a PG unit of the sequence l-Ala-d-iso-Gln-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala with
an intact pentaglycine bridge structure attached to the bridge link
of l-Lys were carried out. Glycopeptide–PG binding
interactions were characterized by root-mean-square-deviation contour
analysis of atomic positions in vancomycin and its three analogues
bound to a PG unit. The overall sampling space for four glycopeptide–PG
complexes shows four distinct distributions with a continuous change
between the conformational spaces. The hydrogen bond analyses show
that multiple hydrogen bonds between the d-Ala-d-Ala and the vancomycin aglycon structure strengthened the dipeptide
binding. The simulations revealed that the removal or chemical modification
of N-methyl-leucine significantly weakens the dipeptide
binding to the aglycon structure and provides interesting structural
insights into glycopeptide–PG binding interactions.

1 Introduction
Vancomycin (Figure 1a, R1) is a glycopeptide antibiotic
isolated in 1956 from the fermentation
of a soil actinomycete, Amycolatopsis orientalis. Since its discovery, vancomycin has been one of the most effective
therapeutic agents for the treatment of serious infections by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.1 Vancomycin inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding with the d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptide of the peptidoglycan (PG)-stem
unit (Figure 1b).2 The d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptide of
PG binds to the aglycon structure of vancomycin, which is a highly
cross-linked rigid cage-like structure formed by the phenolic ether
linkages between the hydroxyphenylglycines at the second and sixth
amino acid positions and between the phenolic hydroxyl residues at
the fourth, fifth, and seventh positions (Figure 1a).3 The solution
NMR structure of vancomycin complexed to acyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala shows that five hydrogen bonds between the heptapeptide
backbone of aglycon to the d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptide
are involved in the glycopeptide–PG binding.4 In vancomycin-resistant enterococci, the d-Ala-d-Ala of the PG stem is replaced by a depsipeptide d-Ala-d-Lac, which replaces one of the hydrogen bonds with
an electrostatic repulsion.5 The depsipeptide
substitution reduces the vancomycin binding affinity (Kd) from micromolar for the dipeptide to millimolar, enabling
vancomycin resistance in enterococcal
bacteria.6

derivatives, and PG.

numbers shown in superscript. (b) Chemical structure of S. aureus PG-peptide stem unit without a disaccharide
GlcNAc-MurNAc. A pentapeptide stem consists of the sequence l-Ala-d-iso-Gln-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala,
and a pentaglycine (dotted box) is attached to the ε-nitrogen
side chain of l-Lys. The d-Ala-d-Ala (circles)
of the PG stem is the known vancomycin-binding site. Three distance
restraints were applied in the simulations: (1) “(a)O7-(b)C1
3.5 Å” which means that the distance between O7 in glycopeptide
(a) and C1 in PG (b) is restrained to 3.5 Å; (2) “(a)N7-(b)C2
5.1 Å” for the restrained distance of 5.1 Å for internuclear
distance between N7 in glycopeptide (a) and C2 in PG (b); and (3)
“(a)N7-(b)C3 4.8 Å” for the restrained distance
of 4.8 Å between N7 in (a) and C3 in (b).

To investigate vancomycin–PG interactions, glycopeptide
binding to a series of peptide analogues of the bacterial cell wall
were characterized using capillary electrophoresis, fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations under different
buffer systems.7 One of the key residues
that was identified as essential for the d-Ala-d-Ala binding was N-methylleucine found at the first
position of the heptapeptide-core structure in vancomycin. N-methylleucine is not part of the dipeptide binding site.4 Nevertheless, the removal of N-methylleucine by Edman degradation8 results
in desleucyl-vancomycin (Figure 1a, R4) devoid of antimicrobial activity.9 Because N-methylleucine is not
directly involved in the dipeptide binding, the mechanism of loss
dipeptide binding by desleucyl-vancomycin remains elusive. In this
study, MD simulations of glycopeptide complexed to the PG-peptide
repeat unit (Figure 1b) were carried out to provide structural and dynamic insights for
understanding the glycopeptide–PG interactions at atomic resolution.2 The role of the N-methylleucine
was elucidated by the MD simulations of PG binding by vancomycin and
N-terminus-modified vancomycin derivatives: vancomycinNtoC, vancomycinSar, and desleucyl-vancomycin. In vancomycinNtoC, the N-methyl in N-methylleucine
of vancomycin is replaced with an ethyl moiety (Figure 1a, R2), and in vancomycinSar,
the N-methylleucine is replaced by sarcosine (N-methylglycine) (Figure 1a, R3). Because the leucine side chain substitution
by sarcosine in vancomycinSar significantly reduces the
hydrophobicity, we hypothesized that the stability of the glycopeptide–PG
complex will gradually transition from vancomycin, vancomycinNtoC, and vancomycinSar to desleucyl-vancomycin
toward the unbound state.

2 Results
2.1 Root-Mean-Square
Deviation (rmsd) Analysis
The rmsd of vancomycin (V1) and
its three analogues: vancomycinNtoC (V2), vancomycinSar (V3), and desleucyl-vancomycin
(V4) complexed with PG-peptide units for four independent simulations
(s1 to s4) is plotted in Figure 2. The stabilities and flexibilities of the complexes
of vancomycin and its analogues bound to the peptide can be estimated
by rmsd values, where a small rmsd indicates high stability and low
flexibility, and vice versa for a large rmsd.

Figure 2 rmsd plots of MD simulations.
The rmsd plots for the complexes
of vancomycin/PG (a), vancomycinNtoC/PG (b), vancomycinSar/PG (c), and desleucyl-vancomycin/PG (d). Independent simulations
for each system are labeled as s1, s2, s3, and s4. The black dashed
line represents the averaged rmsd in each system.

Overall, vancomycin/PG and vancomycinNtoC/PG complexes
exhibit more fluctuation patterns and a lower rmsd range compared
to the vancomycinSar/PG and desleucyl-vancomycin/PG complexes,
as shown in Figure 2, which suggests that the former two complexes have a lower flexibility
and possibly a higher stability than the latter two. The average rmsd
value for the vancomycin/PG is 5.48 Å (Figure 2a). In comparison, the average rmsd value
for desleucyl-vancomycin/PG is 6.29 Å (Figure 2d), for vancomycinNtoC/PG is 5.22
Å (Figure 2b),
and for vancomycinSar/PG is 5.27 Å (Figure 2c).

To explore and compare
the conformational distribution of MD simulations
of vancomycin and desleucyl-vancomycin complexes, 2D contour plots
are generated to illustrate the conformational distribution of these
two complexes (Figure 3). The reference structures for vancomycin/PG (red) and desleucyl-vancomycin/PG
(green) complexes are shown in Figure 3b with a shared aligned peptide structure. Vancomycin
and desleucyl-vancomycin complexes have significantly different conformational
space, which is suggested by two completely different attraction basins
on the 2D contour plot with very little overlap between the distributions
(Figure 3a). In addition,
the distribution for vancomycin/PG (V1) is much narrower than that
of desleucyl-vancomycin/PG (V4). This is consistent with the observation
that the simulations of the vancomycin/PG complex have generally lower
rmsd than those of the desleucyl-vancomycin/PG complex (Figure 2). For the vancomycin/PG rmsd
distribution (V1), only a single attraction basin is observed at (5.5,
8.5 Å). This is in contrast to the multiple basins observed for
the rmsd distribution of the desleucyl-vancomycin/PG complex (V4)
centered at (8.5, 4.5 Å), (8.5, 6.5 Å), and (9, 6.5 Å)
(Figure 3a). The broad
distribution with multiple basins for the desleucyl-vancomycin/PG
complex supports that the PG binding by desleucyl-vancomycin is more
flexible than that by vancomycin.

and desleucyl-vancomycin.

and desleucyl-vancomycin MD simulations. The contour lines represent

complexes as references for rmsd (Å) calculation. For each frame
of simulations, two rmsd (Å) values are calculated and plotted
in regard to the reference vancomycin/PG and desleucyl-vancomycin/PG
complex structures.

To further characterize
all four glycopeptide–PG complexes,
the comparative 2D rmsd distributions of vancomycin/PG (V1) and vancomycinNtoC/PG complexes (V2) are shown in Figure 4a, V1 and vancomycinSar/PG (V3)
in Figure 4b, desleucyl-vancomycin/PG
(V4) and V2 in Figure 4c, and V4 and V3 in Figure 4d. While the rmsd distributions for V1 and V2 show a significant
overlap with attraction basins of each complex being close to each
other (Figure 4a),
the V1 and V3 distributions show only a minimal overlap with increased
separation between the basins (Figure 4b). This indicates that the binding mode of the vancomycinNtoC/PG complex resembles more closely to that of vancomycin/PG
than that of the vancomycinSar/PG complex. By contrast,
the plots of vancomycinNtoC/PG (V2) and desleucyl-vancomycin/PG
(V4) complex distributions show no overlap (Figure 4c). This suggests that the binding mode of
vancomycinNtoC and PG resembles more closely to that of
the vancomycin/PG complex than that of the desleucyl-vancomycin/PG
complex. The desleucyl-vancomycin/PG complex distribution (V4), which
overlaps with about one-third of the vancomycinSar/PG complex
(V3) (Figure 4d), shows
that these two complexes share significant conformational space.

in regard to the reference structure, which is the initial structure
for the MD simulation of each complex. The contour lines represent
the density of trajectories that are located within the area.

2.2 Conformational
Space for Glycopeptide–PG
Complexes
To elucidate the relationship among these four
glycopeptide–PG complexes, the simulations of all four complexes
are plotted on a same 2D rmsd plot using vancomycin/PG and desleucyl-vancomycin/PG
complexes as the reference structures to characterize their distribution
in overall conformational space. One of the advantages of this analysis
is that it reveals the total conformational space for all glycopeptide–PG
complexes. The overall shape of distributions is similar to the combined
distribution of 2D rmsd plots shown in Figures 3 and 4. Four major
clusters were identified from the overall distribution using k-means clustering analysis10 (Figure 5a). The
shape and position of four clusters suggest some corresponding relations
to the four glycopeptide–PG complexes.

Figure 5 Overall sampling space
and distribution of four glycopeptide–PG
complexes. (a) Distribution of four glycopeptide–PG complexes
in regard to vancomycin/PG and desleucyl-vancomycin/PG complexes as
reference structures. The overall distribution is divided into four
clusters (a, b, c, and d) using k-means clustering
analysis. (b) Percentile of the contribution to each cluster in the
panel (a) from simulations of each glycopeptide–PG complex:
van, red (vancomycin); des-van, green (desleucyl-vancomycin); vanSar, yellow (vancomycinSar); and vanNtoC, blue (vancomycinNtoC).

The percentile contribution from the simulations of each
glycopeptide–PG
complex was calculated for each cluster and plotted in Figure 5b. Cluster “a” primarily corresponds to the conformational space
of the vancomycin/PG complex (V1), as shown in Figures 4 and 5a. Thus, the
vancomycin/PG complex distribution is the dominant contributor to
cluster “a” (90%) with a minor contribution
arising from the adjacent cluster “b”.
In cluster “b”, the vancomycinNtoC/PG complex, which closely resembles the vancomycin/PG
complex more than any other analogues, is the major contributor (65%)
with minor contributions from the adjacent clusters “a” and “c” (3% to
each). In cluster “c”, the vancomycinSar/PG complex distribution is the dominant contributor (61%).
The contribution from cluster “d” to
the complex (21%) is significantly higher than that of cluster “b” (11%). Finally, in cluster “d”, the desleucyl-vancomycin/PG complex is the dominant contributor
(79%) with 21% contribution from the vancomycinSar/PG complex.

Interestingly, with an exception of vancomycin, which contributes
to clusters “a” and “b” only, all three vancomycin analogues complexed
with PG contribute to three clusters. For example, vancomycinNtoC contributes to clusters “a”,
“b”, and “c” and vancomycinSar and desleucyl-vancomycin both
contribute to clusters “b”, “c”, and “d”. This
indicates that the vancomycin/PG complex has the narrowest distribution
among all four complexes, and this suggests that it is also the most
stable. This sequential distribution patterns exhibited by the vancomycin
analogues, vancomycinNtoC and vancomycinSar (Figure 5b), are consistent
with the vancomycin analogues representing the intermediate states
for progressive transition in PG binding from vancomycin to desleucyl-vancomycin
that results in the loss of PG-dipeptide binding.

2.3 Interaction between PG and Vancomycin Analogues
A crucial
insight into the molecular interaction for vancomycin
and desleucyl-vancomycin with PG-peptide stem units is obtained from
the detailed analysis of key atomic pairs found in the model structures.
Model structures of vancomycin and desleucyl-vancomycin bound to the
PG representing the centers of attraction basins in contour plots
of these two simulations are illustrated in Figure 6a,b, respectively. The distribution of two
pairs of key atomic distances, between N5 from desleucyl-vancomycin
and N5 in d-Ala-d-Ala of PG (N5v−N5p) and
between O6 from desleucyl-vancomycin and O5 in d-Ala-d-Ala of PG (O6v–O5p), from the simulations is co-plotted
for both vancomycin/PG (V1) and desleucyl-vancomycin/PG complexes
(V4) in Figure 6c.
The N5v–N5p and O6v–O5p distances represent key interactions
between the aglycon structure of vancomycin and the bound d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptide of PG. The distributions of V1 and
V4 do not co-localize on the 2D contour plot, indicating that vancomycin
and desleucyl-vancomycin have an intrinsic difference in their interactions
with d-Ala-d-Ala. The vancomycin/PG complex (V1)
has a narrower distribution for N5v–N5p and O6v–O5p
distances centered around (6.5, 6 Å) than desleucyl-vancomycin/PG
(V4) centered around (9, 11 Å). The result from pair distance
distribution simulations is consistent with the evidence that the
conformational space distribution of vancomycin interaction with the d-Ala-d-Ala moiety of PG is narrower and significantly
stronger (Figure 5b)
than that of desleucyl-vancomycin. This provides molecular insights
into the loss of antimicrobial activity in desleucyl-vancomycin as
evidenced in the model structures shown in Figure 6. While vancomycin adopts a binding pocket
conformation that is favorable for binding the d-Ala-d-Ala moiety of PG (Figure 6a), the glycon structure of desleucyl-vancomycin adopts
an extended conformation that is not amenable for the dipeptide binding
(Figure 6b).

2.4 Hydrogen Bonds, Entropy,
and Binding Free
Energy
The total number of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) in each
of four analogues/PG complexes was estimated using VMD 1.9.2 with
the donor–acceptor distance defined as within 3 Å with
the angle cutoff as 20° within a linear (180°) configuration.
Only the H-bonds with greater than 1% occupancy (stable for more than
1% of the simulations) were considered for the analysis. The total
number of H-bonds formed during the simulations of four glycopeptide–PG
complexes ranged from 10 to 13 (Figure 7a). Our simulations show that the vancomycin/PG complex
had the largest number of H-bonds (five H-bonds) among all four complexes.
The five H-bonds in the vancomycin/PG complex showed high occupancy
(up to 27.97%) (Table 1), consistent with multiple H-bonds stabilizing the binding of the d-Ala-d-Ala to the aglycon of vancomycin. By contrast,
the desleucyl-vancomycin/PG complex had the least number of H-bonds
(one H-bond) with a relatively low partial occupancy (up to 14.74%)
(Table 2). The specific
hydrogen bonds with occupancy higher than 3.00% are listed in the Tables 1 and 2.

Figure 7 (a) Number of hydrogen bonds found in the simulations of vancomycin,
vancomycinNtoC, vancomycinSar, and desleucyl-vancomycin
binding with PG. Only the hydrogen bonds that have more than 1% occupancy
(being stable for more than 1% of the simulations for each complex)
are considered in the analysis. (b) Configurational entropies of Van

the standard deviation from four independent simulations.

We also calculated
the configurational entropies of the four complexes
(Figure 7b and Table 3). For the comparison,
the configurational entropy for each of the vancomycin analogue and
PG was calculated separately. Interestingly, vancomycin has the largest
configurational entropy (836.6 cal/mol·K) among four analogues
with desleucyl-vancomycin as the least (706.4 cal/mol·K). Although
vancomycinNtoC has greater number of atoms than vancomycin,
it has smaller entropy than vancomycin. The calculated entropies show
the decreasing trend from vancomycin, vancomycinNtoC, and
vancomycinSar to desleucyl-vancomycin. A similar trend
is also observed for the normalized entropies, where the calculated
entropies are divided by the number of atoms or by the atomic mass
of each analogue (Table 3), revealing intrinsic properties of these analogues. The calculated
entropies in Table 3 are for the glycopeptides only without PG binding, whereas the calculated
rmsd values in Figures 2 through 5 are for the glycopeptide–PG
complexes. We observed that vancomycin with the highest entropy when
bound to PG results in a vancomycin/PG complex with the lowest rmsd.
Likewise, the desleucyl-vancomycin with the lowest entropy when bound
to PG results in a desleucyl-vancomycin/PG complex with the highest
rmsd. Hence, the low entropy of a glycopeptide does not necessarily
correlate with the low rmsd in glycopeptide–PG complexes and
vice versa.

The
binding free energy was calculated using the molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann
surface area (MM/PBSA) method to further compare the stability of
vancomycin and desleucyl-vancomycin binding with PG. The use of distance
restraints during the simulations prevented the accurate calculation
of the binding free energy; however, all simulations were subjected
to the same distance restraints, and thus the effects of distance
restraints on the binding free energy are likely to be comparable
for all complexes. The estimated binding free energies of vancomycin/PG
and desleucyl-vancomycin/PG complexes are −37.84 ± 2.16
and −11.17 ± 16.07 kcal/mol, respectively. Hence, PG binding
to vancomycin is significantly more favorable than to desleucyl-vancomycin
by a ΔΔG of approximately −27
kcal/mol. Despite the error in the binding free energy calculation
associated with large variance in trajectories, a significant difference
in ΔΔG is consistent with the stable
vancomycin/PG complex compared to the desleucyl-vancomycin/PG complex.

3 Discussions
The X-ray crystal11,12 and solution NMR structures of
vancomycin and related glycopeptides, with an exception of ristocetin,13,14 are found as dimers or oligomers. Hence, drug dimerization is thought
to play an important role in glycopeptide mode of action.15,16 However, the in situ characterization of disaccharide-modified glycopeptides,
including oritavancin that readily forms drug dimers in solution,
when complexed to intact whole cells and isolated cell walls of S. aureus are found as monomers without dimerization.17−24 Glycopeptide antibiotics binding to PG in cell walls as a monomer
is due to complex multivalent interactions among the cell wall glycans
with drug sugar disaccharide and glycopeptide interactions with the
non-d-Ala-d-Ala segment of the PG-stem structure.25 To characterize the monomeric glycopeptide–PG
interactions, MD simulations of vancomycin and its three N-terminus-modified
vancomycin derivatives bound to a PG-stem unit, l-Ala-d-iso-Gln-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, with
a (Gly)5 bridge attached, were carried out.

The first
amino acid in type I glycopeptide antibiotics, which
include vancomycin, chloroeremomycin, and eremomycin, is N-methyl-leucine. N-methyl-leucine is essential for
the dipeptide binding, where the removal by Edman degradation results
in a hexapeptide26 with 100-fold reduction
in dipeptide binding affinity and the loss of antimicrobial activities.27 Accordingly, our simulations show that the desleucyl-vancomycin/PG
complex in general is less ordered than the vancomycin/PG complex.
For example, the average rmsd value for desleucyl-vancomycin/PG simulation
was significantly larger and had much broader rmsd distribution than
that for vancomycin/PG simulation (Figure 2). This indicated that the desleucyl-vancomycin
had greater conformational space with more flexible PG binding than
vancomycin. Moreover, rmsd distributions in the 2D contour plot of
desleucyl-vancomycin and vancomycin did not share a common space,
indicating that desleucyl-vancomycin has a distinct binding structure.
The desleucyl-vancomycin/PG complex, in comparison to the vancomycin/PG
complex, showed reduced binding energy of approximately 27 kcal/mol
(Figure 3). The key
atomic distance distributions of selected atoms in the bound dipeptide
to the aglycon structure of vancomycin and desleucyl-vancomycin (Figure 6c) further reveal
that the d-Ala-d-Ala moiety of PG has a much tighter
binding mode with vancomycin than desleucyl-vancomycin. The superimposed
model structures of vancomycin and desleucyl-vancomycin bound to PG
(Figure 6b) show that
the binding cleft of desleucyl-vancomycin exhibits an extended conformation.

The peptide core of vancomycin is highly cross-linked to form a
rigid structure. By contrast, the side chain of Asn and N-methyl-Leu is highly flexible in the absence of d-Ala-d-Ala binding. This flexibility is crucial for the dipeptide
binding as these side chains are thought to function as “flaps”
to swing into the ligand-binding site as a surrogate in the absence
of a ligand.11 The partial occupancy of
the binding cleft by the Asn and N-methyl-Leu side
chains is thought to prevent the hydration of the aglycon structure.
In the presence of a ligand, the side chains of Asn and N-methyl-Leu facilitate the desolvation of the binding cleft necessary
for the d-Ala-d-Ala binding.12 Following the d-Ala-d-Ala binding, the
side chains of Asn and N-methyl-Leu become rigid.28 Our rmsd distribution analysis shows that the
replacement of N-methyl-Leu by a shortened side-chain
length significantly diminished PG binding and its stability. The
order of the most stable to the least stable glycopeptide–PG
complexes are: vancomycin, vancomycinNtoC, vancomycinSar, and desleucyl-vancomycin. In the case of vancomycinSar, replacing the positively charged N-methyl-leucine
with an ethyl moiety in the aglycon structure interferes with the
binding to the carboxyl terminus of the PG dipeptide.28 The calculated glycopeptide stability correlated with the
overall strength of hydrogen bonding interactions with the highest
for the vancomycin/PG complex and the least for the desleucyl-vancomycin/PG
complex (Figure 7a).
The changes in entropy, despite the shared hydrogen bonds, indicated
that the highest entropy, corresponding to the lowest free energy,
could be the crucial determinant for ligand binding. We anticipate
that the glycopeptide–PG interactions are not local but involves
multiple interactions between the aglycon structure and the non-d-Ala-d-Ala segment of the PG-stem structure that are
likely to be cooperative and critical for the overall effectiveness
of PG binding by the glycopeptide antibiotics. Our study provides
a new approach to characterize the complex interactions between the
PG and glycopeptide antibiotics that will facilitate the design and
development of novel antibiotics against the emerging multidrug-resistant
Gram-positive pathogens.

4 Conclusions
In this
study, we built simplified simulation models to study the
molecular mechanism of vancomycin as an antibiotic through binding
with bacterial cell wall structures. The Edman degradation of vancomycin
cleaves the first residue from the aglycon structure, resulting in
desleucyl-vancomycin with a damaged binding pocket and devoid of any
antimicrobial activities. To reveal the atomic details of vancomycin
and cell wall peptide structure interactions, two vancomycin derivatives
with chemical modification of the first residue in the aglycon structure
were built as intermediate analogues between vancomycin and desleucyl-vancomycin
and referred to as vancomycinNtoC and vancomycinSar. Using MD simulations, we show that the binding in vancomycin/PG
is the tightest among all four analogues. The rmsd distribution analyses
revealed the continuous conformational distribution among these four
analogues from vancomycin to desleucyl-vancomycin. Through atomic
distance analyses, it is also suggested that the d-Ala-d-Ala segment of the PG-stem structure binds more favorably
with vancomycin than its desleucyl analogue. The calculated entropies
and binding free energies of four complexes also displayed a consistent
trend from the most favorable binding of vancomycin against the cell
wall peptide to the least favorable binding of desleucyl-vancomycin.
Overall, the MD simulations provided a new approach to provide insights
for the development of novel glycopeptide antibiotics with improved
antimicrobial activities against the evolving glycopeptide resistance
in pathogens.

5 Computational Methods
5.1 MD Simulations
The structures of
vancomycin and its derivatives (Figure 1) complexed with the PG-peptide repeat unit were based
on the computational models from a previous study25,29 and optimized to the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory using the
Gaussian09 program package.30 The CHARMM
General Force Field (CGenFF) for the simulation system was generated
using the online server ParamChem (https://cgenff.paramchem.org/).31 Atomic charges of the simulation
system were taken from the Gaussian calculations. All systems were
solvated in a water box using a TIP3P model32 with the addition of sodium and chlorine as charge-balancing ions.
Simulation box sizes, number of ions, and the ionic strength are listed
in Table 4. The following
equation was used to calculate the ionic strength based on the simulation
box size and number of ions 1  where i is the ion identification
number and z represents the charge of the ion.

Table 4 Ionic Strengths of Vancomycin/PG,
VancomycinNtoC/PG, VancomycinSar/PG, and Desleucyl
Vancomycin/PG Complexes
 	vancomycin	vancomycinNtoC	vancomcyinSar	desleucyl-vancomycin	
ionic strength (mol·L–1)	84.9	84.8	85.2	71.0	
number of ions	4Cl–,
6Na+	4Cl–,
6Na+	4Cl–,
6Na+	4Cl–,
6Na+	
box size (Å)	46.1	46.1	46.0	48.9	
The simulation boxes were subjected
to 200 steps of the steepest
descent energy minimization and then further energy was minimized
using the adopted basis Newton–Raphson method until the total
gradient of the system was lower than 0.03 kcal/(mol·Å).
Subsequently, the minimized simulation systems were subjected to 24
ps of the MD simulations at a temperature of 300 K as the equilibrium.
Then, the MD simulation of the system was run for 30 ns via an isothermal–isobaric
ensemble at 300 K and 1 atm. The time step for MD simulations is 2
fs, with all the bonds associated with hydrogen being fixed during
the simulation. The cutoff distance for the nonbonded interaction
is 12 Å and using a Nosé–Hoover thermostat33,34 to keep the temperature of the system at 300 K for 30 ns. The leapfrog
Verlet scheme was used for the integration of the atomic velocities
and coordinates in simulations. All simulations used periodic boundary
conditions, and electrostatic interactions were modeled using the
particle mesh Ewald method.35 Three atomic
pair distance restraints were applied during the simulations based
on solid-state NMR experiments.36,37 All simulations were
carried out using a MM simulation program, CHARMM version 40b1.38

5.2 Root-Mean-Square Deviation
(rmsd)
The rmsd is used to measure the difference of the
conformation for
each snapshot of the MD simulations from the reference structure.
For a molecular structure represented by a Cartesian coordinate vector ri (i = 1 to N) of N atoms, the rmsd is calculated as
follows 2  

The Cartesian coordinate vector ri0 is the ith atom in the reference
structure. The transformation matrix U is defined as
the best-fit alignment between the vancomycin/PG complex structures
along trajectories in respect of the reference structure.

5.3 Cross-Correlation Matrix
The correlation
of motion between all atomic pairs in each simulation was measured
through a cross-correlation matrix. The element Cij of the cross-correlation matrix C, which measures the correlation between the movement of
atoms i and j in the simulation,
is defined as 3  where ri and rj are Cartesian
coordinate vectors from the least-square fitted structures in MD simulation
trajectories. It should be noted that the least-square fitting of
the MD trajectory effectively project out the translational and rotational
motions of the vancomycin and its analogues complexed with the peptide.
The normalized matrix elements Cij have their values ranging between −1 and 1. A positive Cij value associates with an
overall positive correlation between atoms i and j, and a negative value corresponds to a negative correlation.

5.4 Configurational Entropy
Entropy was
estimated for the simulation systems using quasi-harmonic approximations
based on MD simulations. Quasi-harmonic analysis was carried out through
the inversion of the cross-correlation matrix C 4  

In eq 4, Fij is
the element of the force constant matrix F describing
the quasi-harmonic potential,39kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Configurational entropy Sconfig of
the simulation system could be calculated using the vibration frequency
ω of the molecule with N atoms 5  ℏ is the reduced Planck
constant.

The vibration frequency ω in the quasi-harmonic
model of
the molecule on the effective quasi-harmonic potential can be calculated
through the solution of the secular equation 6  where M is the mass matrix of
the molecule.

5.5 MM/PBSA Binding Free Energy
Calculation
Total free energy of binding ΔGbinding was computed using the MM/PBSA method. This method
uses a thermodynamic
cycle to calculate the free energy of binding for vancomycin and its
analogues against the PG peptide. The free energies of binding are
computed using the equation 7  where ΔGbindingsol is the
total free energy of binding in solution and ΔGcomplexsol,
ΔGvansol, and ΔGPGsol are free energies
in solution of the complex, vancomycin/analogues, and PG, respectively.
The free energy in solution of each entity (ΔGsol) is calculated by the following equations 8   9   10  where ΔGgas is the
free energy in gas phase and ΔGsolvation is the solvation energy. ΔGgas is the sum of the internal energy (Einternal), van der Waals (EvdW) and Coulombic
(Eelectrostatic) interactions,
as well as entropic contributions (ΔS). The
internal energy includes bond stretching, bond angle, and torsional
contributions to the total MM energies. The solvation energy ΔGsolvation includes polar (ΔGPB) and nonpolar (ΔGnonpolar) contributions.
