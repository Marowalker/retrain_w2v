The
corrosion inhibition performance of propanediyl-1,3-bis(N,N-dimethyl-N-dodecylammonium
bromide) and propanediyl-1,3-bis(N,N-dihydroxyethyl-N-dodecylammonium bromide), abbreviated
as PDDB and PDHDB, respectively, for carbon steel in 1.0 mol·L–1 hydrochloric acid solution was investigated using
the gravimetric method and various electrochemical techniques, together
with scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometry.
Results show that PDHDB always has a better inhibition performance
relative to PDDB, which can be attributed to the introduction of hydroxyl
groups at the hydrophilic headgroups, thereby causing an extra interaction
between inhibitors and the metal surface and favoring its adsorption.
These findings highlight that the modification to the headgroups of
Gemini-type inhibitors may be another effective approach to improving
their inhibition performance.

1 Introduction
Carbon
steel is very often applied in diverse industrial fields,
including building; chemical processing; oil/gas storage and transportation;
process vessel, equipment, and pipeline; and so forth, due to its
low cost, incredible mechanical workability, and easy availability
for constructing various vessels.1,2 Nevertheless,
any environment containing water has a notable potential to generate
corrosive activity, since it can inevitably dissolve gases (e.g.,
O2 and CO2) and mineral salts. For instance,
in petroleum and natural gas industries, oil field formation water
always contains high-concentration chlorides, carbonates, sulfates,
and dissolved gases, such as H2S and CO2, thereby
causing massive economic loss. Also, in many industrial processes,
acid solutions are widely used for cleaning, pickling, descaling,
etching of metal, and oil well acidizing. Unfortunately, carbon steel
is dramatically sensitive to being corroded in contact with various
aggressive media, especially in the acidic environment.3 To address acid corrosion, the use of inhibitors
is one of the most effective and practical methods to prevent carbon
steel from the corrosion and reduce the corrosive attack. In principle,
inhibitors normally function by adsorbing on the metal surface and
then forming a compact barrier layer, thereby protecting the metal
against corrosion; moreover, the adsorption interactions can generally
be classified into two categories: physisorption via electrostatic
interactions and chemisorption via the formation of coordinate covalent
bonds.3 Among various inhibitors, Gemini
surfactants are considered to be a promising candidate in the anticorrosion
applications due to their unique molecular structures and outstanding
surface properties.4,5 To date, bis(quaternary ammonium)-type
Gemini surfactants have widely been investigated in anticorrosion
applications as inhibitors.4

As effective
inhibitors, the used organic compounds are generally
required to contain heteroatoms bearing lone-pair electrons, such
as S, P, O, N, etc., multiple (double and/or triple) bonds, and conjugated
aromatic circles, since the chemisorption, having a stronger interaction
relative to physisorption, can be facilitated by the charge sharing
or transfer from such electron-rich functional groups to the metal
surface.6,7 Accordingly, various heteroatoms or aromatic
rings should be introduced into one of three moieties (structural
variables) in such bis(quaternary ammonium) Gemini surfactants, i.e.,
the spacer, hydrophobic tail, and hydrophilic head, due to the possibility
of forming coordinate bonds, to improve their adsorption effectiveness
and inhibition efficiencies (IEs).8−15 However, the current interest has so far concentrated mainly on
modifying the spacer of Gemini-type inhibitors by means of using heteroatoms
or double/triple bonds, with the exception of using the hydroxyethyl
to replace the methyl at the quaternary ammonium headgroups.10 Moreover, among such inhibitors, the quaternary
ammonium salt was commonly chosen as the headgroup. In essence, the
high-efficiency inhibition action is thought to originate from the
tightly packed layer of inhibitors that can cover the metal surface
and isolate the metal from the aggressive medium.16−19 In spite of its popularity, many
fundamental questions surrounding the adsorption of Gemini inhibitors
remain to be answered.4,20 Particularly, the role and the
size of heteroatom-containing substitutes have not been firmly established
yet.4,10 Therefore, in the present work, our primary
objective of introducing an electronegative heteroatom into the headgroups
in such bis(quaternary ammonium) Gemini inhibitors was twofold: (i)
to assess its influence on the inhibition performances and (ii) to
judge the role that the modified functional groups play.

To
address these issues, a new cationic Gemini-type surfactant,
propanediyl-1,3-bis(N,N-dihydroxyethyl-N-dodecylammonium bromide), abbreviated as PDHDB (Chart 1), was synthesized
as an inhibitor. To shed more light on the inhibitory action, an analogous
counterpart, propanediyl-1,3-bis(dimethyldodecyl-ammonium bromide),
referred to as PDDB (Chart 1), was also included in this work. The inhibition performances
of both surfactants were investigated and compared carefully by means
of the gravimetric method, potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) measurement,
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. Results
show that the introduction of hydroxyl groups into the headgroups
does favor enhancing the IE value. Our findings highlight the need
for taking a wide range of the combination of structural variables
in inhibitors into consideration when designing their molecular structures
and optimizing their inhibition properties.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Gravimetric Measurements
The gravimetric
measurement is a reliable method to judge the effect of the concentration
of inhibitors on IEs. All results obtained from gravimetric measurements
in the HCl solution without inhibitors and with PDDB or PDHDB at different
concentrations, including IEs, corrosion rate, and surface coverage,
are compiled in Table 1. Herein, the corrosion rate (v in millimeters per
year, mm·y–1) of carbon steel in the absence
and presence of PDDB or PDHDB with different concentrations was determined
in terms of the mass loss values after 6 h immersion at 25.0 °C,21 which was calculated via eq 1 as follows 1  where K is a constant (8.76
× 104); Δm (g) and ρ
(g·cm–3) are the mass loss of carbon steel
specimens and the carbon steel density (7.86 g·cm–3), respectively; and S (cm2) and t (h) are the exposed surface area and the immersion time,
respectively.

On the basis of the calculated corrosion rates, the
IE (η)
values were calculated according to eq 2 2  where v0 (mm·y–1) and v (mm·y–1) are the corrosion rates
of carbon steel coupons in a 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl
solution in the absence and presence of inhibitors,
respectively.

Since the inhibitory corrosion action was based
on adsorption,
in which most of the electroactive sites had been effectively blocked
by adsorbed inhibitors, the corrosion rate could be considered as
a measure of the number of free corrosion sites remaining. If assuming
that the corrosion only took place at such free sites and the blocked
site had a negligible contribution to the total corrosion rate, the
IE values were thus correlated with the surface coverage (θ)
directly.22 Accordingly, a widely used
relation between θ and η had been proposed, given in eq 3(23) 3  Figure 1 shows the
variation profiles of IEs, coupled with corrosion
rates, with the logarithmic concentration (C) of
PDDB and PDHDB. Obviously, in the range of lower concentrations of
inhibitors, the IE values increase sharply with increasing concentrations,
whereas these values gradually level off as the concentrations are
raised. By comparison, the change in the corrosion rates shows an
opposite tendency: initially decreasing rapidly, then leveling off.
That is to say, the IE value increases with the incremental concentrations
of inhibitors, while the corrosion rate decreases. These changes in
IEs and corrosion rates can be ascribed to the adsorption of PDHDB
and PDDB, where the adsorption amount increases with increasing concentrations
of inhibitors, thereby forming a protective film of inhibitor adsorbed
and retarding the corrosion.

Figure 1 Variations of IEs and corrosion rates of carbon
steel with the
logarithmic concentrations of PDDB and PDHDB in 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl.

In the present work,
both PDHDB and PDDB present a good inhibitive
performance in relatively low-concentration ranges, even when the
concentration was as low as 1.0 × 10–5 mol·L–1. More importantly, as expected, in the entire concentration
range, PDHDB shows better inhibitive performance than PDDB. This can
be attributed to the introduction of the hydroxyls at the headgroups
in the former case, thereby causing a strong interaction between inhibitors
and the metal surface, which can be further confirmed by the following
characterizations and analyses.

2.2 Adsorption
Isotherms
The adsorption
of inhibitor molecules at the metal surface/solution interface can
routinely provide information about their interactions with the metal
surface and interactions among the adsorbed inhibitors themselves
as well. Since the adsorption of inhibitors is of a quasi-equilibrium
nature, an appropriate adsorption isotherm can be allowed to represent
this procedure. In the present study, the surface coverage values
were obtained from the gravimetric data and the Langmuir adsorption
isotherm model was used to fit these experimental data of PDDB and
PDHDB, affording high regression coefficients of R2 = 0.99888 and 0.99970, respectively, and slope values
slightly larger than unity (1.116 and 1.086 for PDDB and PDHDB, respectively),
as given in Figure 2 and Table 2. The
former suggests that the experimental data are well described by the
Langmuir adsorption isotherm, that is, the adsorption process of PDDB
or PDHDB conforms to the Langmuir isothermal adsorption. The latter
denotes that such a deviation in the slope from unity is a likely
consequence of the presence of an intermolecular weak interaction
among the adjacent adsorbed molecules, since this interaction is theoretically
ignored during deriving the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.24,25

adsorption isotherms of PDDB or PDHDB on the surface of
carbon steel in 1 mol·L–1 HCl.

Table 2 Thermodynamic Parameters of PDDB and
PDHDB Adsorbed on Carbon Steel in 1 mol·L–1 HCl
inhibitor	Kads/×103 L·mol–1	ΔGads/kJ·mol–1	R2	
PDDB	651.68	–43.14	0.99888	
PDHDB	845.59	–43.79	0.99970	
In the Langmuir model,
the surface coverage, θ, can be correlated
with the inhibitor concentration, C, in terms of eq 4(26) 4  where Kads denotes
the adsorption equilibrium constant in the adsorption process. Herein, Kads, obtained from the intercept of the Langmuir
isotherm, displays much higher values, given in Table 2, meaning that PDDB and PDHDB can preferentially
adsorb on the carbon steel surface and thus deliver great IE values.

The equilibrium constant, Kads, could
be applied to determine the standard Gibbs free energy of the adsorption
process, ΔGads, by means of eq 5(27) 5  where the
value 55.5 (mol·L–1) represents the molar concentration
of water in solution, R (J·mol–1·K–1) is the universal gas constant gas of
8.314, and T (K) is the absolute temperature. In
this work, the ΔGads values of PDDB
and PDHDB were calculated
to be −43.14 and 43.79 kJ·mol–1, respectively,
which are also given in Table 2.

The negative values of ΔGads demonstrate
that their adsorption is a spontaneous process and both of them can
adsorb on the carbon steel surface and form a defensive film. In general,
when the physisorption process takes place, the corresponding ΔGads values are usually close to or less than
−20 kJ·mol–1 in virtue of the electrostatic
interaction; in contrast, if the chemisorption process occurs, ΔGads displays a more negative value, i.e., close
to or higher than −40 kJ·mol–1, due
to the formation of a coordinate covalent bond.6,23,28 Herein, PDHDB and PDDB present more negative
values, i.e., −43.79 and −43.14 kJ·mol–1, respectively, which are in a good agreement with those of analogues
reported recently.22,29 In these two studies, Gao et
al. and Mobin et al. attributed the more negative ΔGads values (less than −40 kJ·mol–1) to cationic Gemini-type inhibitors having the special molecular
structure, hence endowing themselves with a high adsorption ability
and in turn forming a strong protective film.22,29 However, as discussed elsewhere,17,30−32 the adsorption of inhibitors on metal surfaces cannot only be considered
to be pure physisorption or chemisorption. Except for the chemisorption
(if it does), inhibitors can also be adsorbed on the metal surfaces
by means of physical interactions. As a result, in the present work,
it is concluded that: (i) considering the fact that a PDDB molecule
can dissociate into only one bivalent cation and two Br– anions, the adsorption of PDDB molecules on the carbon steel surface
is an integrated type of physical and chemical adsorptions, but with
a predominant electrostatic interaction (physisorption), and (ii)
on the basis of the difference in the molecular structures and the
IEs between PDDB and PDHDB, the presence of hydroxyethyl groups in
PDHDB can contribute to the chemisorption to some extent.

2.3 Open-Circuit Potential (OCP) versus Immersion
Time
Figure 3 shows the variation of the open-circuit potential (EOCP) of working electrodes versus the Ag/AgCl electrode
as a function of immersion time in the aerated and unstirred 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl solution in the absence and presence of PDDB
or PDHDB with a concentration of 3.0 × 10–5 mol·L–1. Herein, the EOCP value in the blank HCl solution anodically shifted to more
positive potentials and then gradually leveled off after an immersion
time of 1500 s. This can be attributed to the initial dissolution
process of the air-formed oxide layer at the carbon steel surface
and the attack on the bare metal as well. By contrast, the addition
of PDDB or PDHDB led to the fact that the steady potentials were attained
more readily; moreover, the steady state presented a slight positive
(PDDB) and negative (PDHDB) shift in EOCP, which is a likely result of forming a protective film on the metal
surface and thus impeding the anodic or cathodic sites.33,34 However, the maximum shift in EOCP was
less than 20 mV after adding PDDB or PDHDB, denoting that both of
them behave as mixed-type inhibitors.

time for carbon steel in
1.0 mol·L–1 HCl solution in the absence and
presence of 3 × 10–5 mol·L–1 PDDB and PDHDB.

2.4 Potentiodynamic
Polarization (PDP) Measurements
Figure 4 shows the
PDP curves for the carbon steel in 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl solution without and with the addition of various concentrations
(from 1.0 × 10–6 to 3.0 × 10–5 mol·L–1) of PDDB (A) and PDHDB (B). To shed
more light on the kinetics process of the carbon steel dissolution,
the related electrochemical parameters, such as corrosion potential
(Ecorr), corrosion current density (Icorr), anodic (βa) and cathodic
(βc) Tafel slopes, and IEs (η), were determined
and are compiled in Table 3. The η values of PDDB and PDHDB were calculated using eq 6 6  where Icorr and Iinh are the corrosion current densities in mA·cm–2 before and after adding inhibitors, respectively,
derived from extrapolating the cathodic and anodic Tafel lines to
the corrosion potential.

steel in 1 mol·L–1 HCl without and with different

 	3 × 10–5	–425.3	0.0233	0.0755	–0.1476	88.8	
As is apparent, a concentration-dependent shift in both the anodic
and cathodic branches toward lower values of current density was observed;
moreover, the higher the concentration, the more prominent the shift
becomes. That is to say, the addition of PDDB and PDHDB leads to a
dramatic reduction in the Icorr values:
the Icorr values shift from 0.2081 mA·cm–2 (blank) to 0.0235 mA·cm–2 for
PDDB and to 0.0233 mA·cm–2 for PDHDB, at the
concentration of 3.0 × 10–5 mol·L–1. This means that in aggressive media, both cathodic
hydrogen evolution and anodic dissolution reactions are dramatically
inhibited with the increase in concentrations. In Table 3, both the βc and βa values present only a slight variation,
indicating that PDDB and PDHDB both function by blocking the contact
of HCl with the metal surface due to their adsorption but do not significantly
alter the mechanism of the corrosion reaction.30 Furthermore, there is no definite trend in the shift of
the corrosion potential (Ecorr) in the
presence of PDDB and PDHDB with their increasing concentrations, and
the absolute value of the maximum shift in ΔEcorr is nearly less than 15 mV, suggesting that the inhibition
action may stem from the geometric blocking effect.33 Taken together, the reduction in anodic and cathodic current
densities and the slight variation in βc and βa slopes denote that both PDDB and PDHDB, together with the
shift in Ecorr, behave as mixed-type inhibitors,
consistent with the OCP result, and act on both the cathodic hydrogen
evolution reaction and the anodic metal dissolution reaction,35−37 thereby yielding an increase in the IE values. In addition, it is
noteworthy that the variation of IEs with the concentration obtained
from gravimetric and PDP measurements presents a good agreement; moreover,
the IE value of PDHDB is always better than that of PDDB in the entire
concentration range.

In this work, the IEs nearly reach separately
up to 89% for PDDB
and PDHDB, based on PDP data, suggesting that both inhibitors have
a good inhibition action, especially in their low- and moderate-concentration
ranges. To address this issue, an IE comparison between our inhibitors
(PDDB and PDHDB) and analogous bis(quaternary ammonium)-type Gemini
inhibitors reported previously was conducted, as given in Table S1.

2.5 Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
EIS measurements can provide
the exact and rapid information on
the kinetics of electrochemical processes and the surface properties
of the investigated systems without destroying the adsorbed layer,
thereby allowing one to better understand the corrosion mechanism
taking place at the electrode/solution interface. In Figure 5 (for PDDB) and Figure 6 (for PDHDB) are presented
Nyquist plots (A) and Bode and phase angle plots (B) for carbon steel
in a 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl solution without and with
different concentrations of inhibitors. From Nyquist plots in Figures 5 and 6, two typical features can be acquired. First, all of the
impedance spectra almost present a single capacitive loop with a progressive
increment in their diameters with increasing concentrations of PDDB
and PDHDB, which implies that the corrosion of carbon steel in 1.0
mol·L–1 HCl without and with the addition of
two such inhibitors is commonly related to the double-layer behavior
and primarily dominated by a charge transfer process. Moreover, a
better protective film is formed on the metal surface due to the increasing
diameters, accompanied with the incremental inhibitor concentrations.38,39 Second, all semicircles, illustrated in a complex plane, exhibit
a slightly depressed nature, all of the centers of which are located
under the abscissa, attributed to the dispersion in the frequency
of the interfacial impedance during the corrosion due to the different
physical phenomena, such as the surface roughness, impurities, inhomogeneous
electrode surface, adsorption of inhibitors, etc.40 As a result, a frequency-distributed constant phase element
(CPE) is, generally, introduced to replace the real double-layer capacitance
(Cdl) at the metal/solution interface
in the equivalent circuit, to accurately determine the impedance parameters
and to precisely understand the effects of the roughness and other
inhomogeneities.41

(B) Bode and phase angle plots for carbon
steel in 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl containing different
concentrations of PDDB.

Figure 6 (A) Nyquist plots and
(B) Bode and phase angle plots for carbon
steel in 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl containing different
concentrations of PDHDB.

In all EIS diagrams,
Nyquist and Bode plots only exhibited a semicircle
capacitive loop and one peak, respectively, indicating the existence
of one-time constant (single relaxation process) in all electrochemical
processes, which was correlated with the formation of the electrical
double layer at the electrode/solution interface.42Figure 7 gives a simple one-time-constant electrical equivalent circuit,
which is employed to analyze the impedance data. In this equivalent
circuit, a solution resistance (Rs) is
in series connected with a parallel combination of a CPE and a polarization
resistance (Rp). Herein, Rp, corresponding to the difference in real impedance at
lower and higher frequencies, contains charge transfer resistance Rct, diffuse layer resistance Rd, accumulation resistance Ra and film resistance Rf, i.e., Rp = Rct + Rd + Ra + Rf.43Figures 5 and 6 also show all fitted results, which are described quite well using
this equivalent circuit.

Figure 7 Electrochemical equivalent circuits used to
fit the impedance data.

The impedance of CPE
(ZCPE) in the
equivalent circuit is defined as eq 7(44) 7  where Y0 represents
the admittance of the CPE in sn·Ω–1·cm–2, j is the imaginary unit,
ω is the angular frequency in rad·s–1, and n is the CPE exponent, as an indicator of
the inhomogeneity or roughness of the electrode surface. Herein, the
double-layer capacitance, Cdl, can be
calculated using eq 8(45) 8  Then, the
IE (η) values can be obtained
from eq 9(46) 9  where Rp0 and Rp are the polarization resistance values without and with
PDDB or
PDHDB, respectively. All of the impedance parameters derived from
the fitting analyses of EIS profiles are summarized in Table 4.

η values exhibit a prominent tendency, i.e., a successive increase
with the inhibitor concentration, while the Cdl values display an opposite change, i.e., a consecutive decrease.
Herein, the Rp values increase from 80.36
Ω·cm2 (blank) to 681.25 Ω·cm2 (PDDB) and 702.40 Ω·cm2 (PDHDB); meanwhile,
the maximum η values reach up to 88.2 and 88.6% for PDDB and
PDHDB, respectively, at the concentration of 3.0 × 10–5 mol·L–1. These results are a likely consequence
of the adsorption of more inhibitors on the carbon steel surface as
the inhibitor concentration is raised, leading to a higher surface
coverage and thus enhancing the inhibition efficiency. In contrast,
the reduction in the Cdl values is a likely
consequence of the increase in the thickness of such adsorbed films
and/or the decrease in the local dielectric constant.29,47,48 Therefore, the variation in Rp, Cdl, and η
with the PDDB or PDHDB concentrations lends further support to the
fact that these inhibitor molecules can fabricate a protective layer
via adsorbing on the electrode surface and protect the carbon steel
surface from the attack of corrosive media.

One final issue
that deserves comment is that the changing trend
of η values with the concentrations of PDDB or PDHDB, obtained
from the EIS method in Table 4, is also consistent with the results from gravimetric and
PDP measurements. In particular, over the entire concentration range
studied, PDHDB still exhibits slightly higher IE values than PDDB,
especially at low concentrations, implying that the former has a better
anticorrosive performance than the latter. This is further confirmed
by the quantum chemical calculations. Density functional theory (DFT)
results suggest that PDHDB would adsorb on the metal more easily than
PDDB and more effectively prevent the metal from corrosion (for more
details, see Figure S6 and Table S2).

2.6 Surface Characterization
Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and the corresponding energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) images for the freshly polished carbon steel coupons
in the absence and presence of PDDB or PDHDB are shown in Figure 8. Herein, the EDS
images were obtained from the specimens corresponding to the SEM images.
The SEM image in Figure 8B gives a rougher surface, derived from the inhibitor-free solution,
compared to those in the presence of PDDB (Figure 8C) and PDHDB (Figure 8D) with the inhibited system. This lends
direct support to the inhibition action of PDDB and PDHDB in the aggressive
media. In Figure 8B,
the EDS result of the carbon steel in the uninhibited solution presents
the lower characteristic signals of Fe, Mn, and Cu, compared to those
of freshly polished or inhibited carbon steel. Herein, Fe peaks are
dramatically suppressed and the Fe content is reduced from 96.60%
(for freshly polished carbon steel coupon) to 88.57% (for carbon steel
in 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl solution without any inhibitor).
By comparison, the peak corresponding to the O element appears, suggesting
the formation of iron oxide in 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl
solution. These results indicate that the carbon steel surface is
covered with the oxide film in the absence of inhibitors. On the other
hand, in the presence of PDDB (Figure 8C) and PDHDB (Figure 8D), the EDS images show an identical result to that
of the initial carbon steel. In this work, the mass ratio of Fe almost
returns to the initial value, from 88.57% (blank) to 96.54% for PDDB
and to 96.48% for PDHDB; meanwhile, the peak of the O element cannot
be observed. SEM and EDS results, taken together, indicate that both
PDDB and PDHDB can adsorb on the carbon steel surface and significantly
retard the corrosion rate of carbon steel so that the chemical composition
on the surface almost remains intact.

EDS images (right) obtained

the absence of inhibitor, (C) in the presence of 3.0 × 10–5 mol·L–1 PDDB, and (D) in the
presence of 3.0 × 10–5 mol·L–1 PDHDB.

2.7 Adsorption
Mechanism
In this work,
the gravimetric, electrochemical, and morphological data, in connection
with the isothermal adsorption analysis, illustrate that the addition
of PDDB and PDHDB does play a critical role in determining the resultant
inhibition performance of the carbon steel in 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl solution; moreover, over the entire concentration range studied,
PDHDB displays a superior inhibition performance relative to PDDB,
which is attributed to the introduction of the hydroxyl groups, allowing
the former to have a potential to produce chemisorption to some extent
on the carbon steel surface. According to these results, an inhibition
mechanism of PDDB and PDHDB is proposed, as shown in Figure 9. In brief, as for PDDB and
PDHDB, the dissociated quaternary ammonium bivalent cations can adsorb
on the metal surface via the Coulombic attraction with the initially
adsorbed anions, like chloride and/or bromide ions; in the case of
PDHDB, the electronegative O heteroatom in hydroxyl groups bears lone-pair
electrons, which are favorable for the formation of the coordination
interactions on the metal surface.

interactions of PDDB and
PDHDB on the carbon steel surface.

3 Conclusions
In this work, the effect of introducing
hydroxyls at the headgroup
of cationic Gemini-type inhibitors on the resultant inhibition performance
was investigated. Several results are obtained via comparing the inhibitory
properties between PDDB and PDHDB.1. PDDB and PDHDB can serve as an effective
corrosion inhibitor, the IEs of which increase with their concentrations.

2. PDDB and PDHDB can act
as a mixed-type
inhibitor and form a protective layer on the carbon steel surface,
resulting in a retarded corrosion rate.

3. PDHDB always displays a better inhibition
performance for the carbon steel in 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl solution than PDDB, denoting that the introduction of the hydroxyls
at the headgroups of such bis(quaternary ammonium) Gemini inhibitors
is helpful for enhancing their inhibition action indeed.

4. The adsorption of PDDB and PDHDB conforms
to the Langmuir isotherm model, and their ΔGads values are close to −43.0 kJ·mol–1, indicating that both of them can spontaneously adsorb on the carbon
steel surface.



At a more fundamental
level, our findings suggest that the modification
to the headgroups of Gemini-type inhibitors may be another effective
approach to improving their inhibition performance.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Solution
All chemicals
used in this work were of analytical grade and used as received without
further purification. The N80 carbon steel applied has the following
chemical composition (wt %): 0.35 C, 0.23 Si, 1.46 Mn, 0.011 P, 0.005
S, 0.08 Cu, 0.01 Ni, 0.08 Cr, 0.16 Mo, 0.11 V, 0.024 Al, and balance
Fe. All carbon steel coupons, cut from a carbon steel bar, are a three-dimensional
cuboid with a length of 5 cm, breadth of 1 cm, and thickness of 0.3
cm, unless specified otherwise.

The simulated corrosion solution
of 1.0 mol·L–1 hydrochloric acid (HCl) was
prepared by diluting an analytically pure concentrated HCl in a mass
fraction of 37% with double-distilled water. This solution was also
used as a blank sample for comparison. In this work, the concentrations
of PDDB and PDHDB ranged from 1.0 × 10–6 to
3.0 × 10–5 mol·L–1.

4.2 Synthesis of Inhibitors
In this work,
the synthesis of PDDB was similar to the procedure reported by Zana
et al.,49 while PDHDB was synthesized using
a modified method reported by Wang et al.50 Their chemical structures were characterized by Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR), 1H, and 13C NMR spectra. The
detailed synthesis and spectrum results are given in the Supporting Information.

4.3 Gravimetric
Measurements
Gravimetric
measurement was carried out using an analytical balance with a precision
of ±0.01 mg. Prior to each experiment, the surface of coupons
was mechanically abraded with 600, 800, and 1200 grades of emery papers
in turn, degreased with acetone, then successively rinsed with ethanol
and distilled water, and finally derided in warm air flow. After weighed
accurately, three coupons were then immersed in a 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl solution of 500 mL in the absence and presence
of PDDB or PDHDB at different concentrations for 6 h. The system temperature
was controlled at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C using an ultrathermostatic
bath. After that, to clean rust products, a chemical method was used,
where coupons were immersed in 100 mL of a 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl solution containing 0.8 g of hexamethylenetetramine under sonication
for about 180 s; rinsed thoroughly with distilled water, acetone,
and ethanol in turn; and then dried in warm air flow and weighted
accurately again.51 In this work, average
weight losses were obtained from two to three independent measurements
for the same sample.

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
In this
work, all electrochemical measurements were conducted using a conventional
three-electrode system on a PARSTAT 4000 electrochemical workstation
(Princeton Applied Research). Herein, a carbon steel rod, a platinum
wire, and a Ag/AgCl (with 3.5 M KCl) electrode were utilized as the
working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. As working
electrodes, a carbon steel rod with a diameter of 1.0 cm was embedded
into a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) holder and the void was sealed with
epoxy resin so that a flat metal surface with a 0.785 cm2 surface area was allowed to expose to the aggressive solution. The
pretreatment of working electrodes was similar to the procedure used
in the gravimetric measurements, in which the end surface of the carbon
steel rod was first ground and then degreased, rinsed, and dried finally.
Prior to each measurement, the working electrode was immersed in the
acid media at the open-circuit potential (OCP) for a fixed time span,
30 min, until a steady state was reached. To check the reproducibility,
measurements were independently repeated at least three times for
the same specimen. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra
were acquired within the frequency range of 100 kHz to 50 mHz, where
a sine wave with a 10 mV peak-to-peak amplitude was employed to perturb
the testing system. In this work, the corresponding EIS data were
carefully fitted and processed with ZSimpWin software. Potentiodynamic
polarization (PDP) curves were recorded via varying the potential
automatically from −250 to +250 mV versus the OCP at a scan
rate of 0.25 mV·s–1. For electrochemical measurements,
the cell temperature was also controlled at a constant value of 25.0
± 0.1 °C using with an ultrathermostatic bath.

4.5 Surface Analysis
Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) were used
to assay the surface morphologies and the composition as well. For
the surface characterization, the coupons with a size of 1 cm ×
1 cm × 0.15 cm were cut from parent plates. After 24 h of immersion
in a 1.0 mol·L–1 HCl solution without and with
3.0 × 10–5 mol·L–1 PDDB
or PDHDB, the coupons were rinsed using distilled water and ethanol
in turn, dried, and then immediately subjected to SEM/EDS analysis.

4.6 Quantum Chemical Calculations
Quantum
chemical calculations were performed on PDDB and PDHDB using Gaussian
09 program package. Herein, the Becke three-parameter hybrid functional
together with the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional
(B3LYP) with 6-31G(d,p) basis set was used to geometrically optimize
the molecular structures by density functional theory (DFT).
