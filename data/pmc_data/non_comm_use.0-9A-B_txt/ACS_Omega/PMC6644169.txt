Adsorption method
was first introduced into the propene oxide production
via hydrogen peroxide process to remove the microimpurity in the propylene
oxide (PO) product solution. It could replace the reactive distillation
in separating acetaldehyde with less energy consumption and PO loss.
A series of adsorbents (e.g., 3A, 4A, 5A, 10X, and Y) are first used
to remove the impurity (i.e., acetaldehyde). It is found that 5A molecular
sieves shows the best performance due to uniform porous channels with
suitable pore size. Various techniques such as X-ray diffraction,
scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier
transform infrared, and N2 physisorption are employed to
investigate the structural properties of the adsorbent. Furthermore,
effects of space velocity and temperature are also investigated. Cyclic
desorption and adsorption tests indicate the PO yield is 92.2%, and
96.3% of acetaldehyde was removed. The acetaldehyde concentration
of PO product was 0.0187%, indicating this method can produce industrial-quality
PO that meets the first-level technical requirements.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The conversion of hydrogen
peroxide to propylene oxide (HPPO) has
become more popular in recent years1 and
is considered a crucial method for the environment-friendly production
of propylene oxide (PO)2,3 owing to the method’s safe
reaction conditions, catalytic efficiency, and low production of polluting
byproducts.4 A pilot plant designed to
showcase this novel HPPO process via the production of 1500 tons per
annum (t/a) was built, and propylene epoxidation was performed in
methanol (CH3OH) over TS-1 molecular sieves as catalysts.5 This facility has successfully been in operation
since its establishment and produces fewer pollutants than plants
using alternative methods.

The composition of the crude PO product
being purified at the 1500
t/a pilot plant is illustrated in Table 1.

Table 1 Crude PO Product
species	wt %	
propylene oxide	49.0–49.8	
CH3OH	50.1–50.6	
acetaldehyde (CH3CHO)	0.12–0.25	
H2O	<0.25	
To recover the solvent
(methanol), a distillation step was incorporated
into the processing of the crude product (Table 1), and Table 2 shows the composition of the PO product following
the solvent recovery process. When PO purity exceeded 99% in simple
distillation, the relative volatility of methanol and PO was close
to l, indicating the need for a large reflux ratio to further reduce
the methanol content. On one hand, the larger the reflux ratio, the
more energy and investment are consumed. On the other hand, acetaldehyde
has a boiling point of 20.8 °C, similar to that of PO (34 °C).
It means that light components will accumulate at the top of the tower
as the reflux ratio increases, which substantially increases the acetaldehyde
concentration in PO.

Table 2 PO Product Composition
species	wt %	
propylene oxide	>99.33	
methanol	<0.07	
acetaldehyde	<0.5	
water	<0.01	
Many
U.S. patents6−9 have introduced various extractive distillation solvents for PO
purification, and some U.S. patents10−13 include methods for separating
methyl formate from PO. Although these patents include the removal
of selected PO impurities, none addressed the removal of aldehydes,
particularly acetaldehyde. Rueter14 disclosed
the purification of PO-containing methanol by extractive distillation
with a polar extraction solvent with a hydroxy functionality. The
process also removes a portion of acetaldehyde present in the crude
PO product. Rueter15 used methanol as the
extraction solvent to remove acetaldehyde from PO, but the solvent
itself becomes a close-boiling PO contaminant. Koji and Toshio16 washed the PO product with water, extracted
the aqueous phase with a hydrocarbon solvent, and then distilled the
resulting solution. Because these techniques are impractical for the
improvement of the existing plants, reactive distillation using additives17 was incorporated into the purification process
to remove acetaldehyde from the PO product after recovering methanol
(Table 2). However,
during the actual operation, the results showed that the additives
could react with PO, resulting in a PO yield of only 90% after reactive
distillation. Schmidt18 believed that chemical
reactions that interfere with the normal mass-transfer steps may be
occurring during distillation, thereby producing anomalous results.
It is therefore necessary to discover a novel separation method of
removing aldehyde impurities to reduce the loss of PO during product
purification.

Separation engineering relies heavily on liquid
phase adsorption.19,20 When screening adsorbents in
the purification process, the properties
of both adsorbates and adsorbents must be considered, with a focus
on examining how operational conditions influence the dynamic liquid–solid
adsorption.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Adsorbent
Screening
Physical adsorption
is greatly influenced by the molecular diameter and polarity of the
adsorbate. Table 3 illustrates
the differences in molecular property between two adsorbates as simulated
in Materials Studio 8.0 (MS).

Table 3 Molecular Dimensions
and Dipole Moments
of Adsorbates
species	molecular
diameter (10–10 m)	dipole

(D)	
propylene oxide	6.0	1.9	
acetaldehyde	5.0	2.7	
As shown in the table, acetaldehyde is smaller and
more polar than
PO. Molecular sieves are suitable for adsorbing polar molecules and
are able to sieve adsorbates based on the size and configuration of
the molecules. Table 4 illustrates the pore sizes of several common molecular sieves.

Table 4 Pore Size of Molecular Sieves
molecular
sieves	pore dimension (10–10 m)	molecular
sieves	pore dimension (10–10 m)	
3A	2.1–3.2	10X	8.0–9.0	
4A	4.1–4.6	13X	9.0–10.0	
5A	4.9–5.6	Y	9.0–10.0	
Several common
adsorbents shown in Table 4, as well as activated carbon, were selected
as alternative adsorbents. Simulated PO product with 0.22 (wt %) CH3CHO was prepared following the values given in Table 1. The static liquid–solid
adsorption apparatus was used to examine the efficacy of alternate
adsorbents. The mass of PO solution was 16 times that of the adsorbent.
The adsorption results are given in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Comparison of adsorbent performance.

As shown in Figure 1, the 3A and 4A molecular sieves as well as the activated
carbon
adsorbed almost no acetaldehyde from the simulated PO product. However,
the 10X, Y, and 5A molecular sieves effectively reduced the acetaldehyde
content of the solution, and the 5A molecular sieves were most efficient.
After 5 h, the 5A molecular sieve had adsorbed 100% of acetaldehyde,
whereas the Y and 10X molecular sieves had adsorbed 72.0 and 58.1%
of acetaldehyde, respectively. The 3A and 4A molecular sieves and
the activated carbon removed less than 15% of acetaldehyde in 5 h
because the pore sizes of 3A and 4A are smaller than acetaldehyde,
which prevents adsorption. Activated carbon is nonpolar, making it
unsuitable for adsorbing polar molecules.

The simulated PO product
with 0.42 (wt %) CH3CHO was
prepared in accordance with the values given in Table 2. The static liquid–solid adsorption
apparatus was used to further screen the adsorption of acetaldehyde
from PO. The mass ratio remained 1:16, and the results are illustrated
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Comparison
of adsorbent performance.

As illustrated above, 5A, Y, and 10X molecular sieves were
somewhat
effective at adsorbing acetaldehyde in the simulated PO product, though
5A sieves proved more effective than either Y or 10X. After 6 h of
absorption, the 5A sieves had removed 100% of acetaldehyde, whereas
the Y and 10X sieves had removed only 56.9 and 49.9%, respectively.
This is because the diameters of the pores of the Y and 10X sieves
are larger than those of PO and acetaldehyde molecules, meaning that
not only the molecules of acetaldehyde but also PO can enter the adsorbents’
channels. As the concentration of PO is highly greater than that of
acetaldehyde, plenty of porous space will be occupied by the molecules
of PO, restricting the adsorption capacity of acetaldehyde on the
Y and 10X sieves.

2.2 Effect of Space Velocity
on Adsorption
The 5A molecular sieves were chosen as the
primary adsorbent for
separating acetaldehyde from the PO product. Liquid weight hourly
space velocity (LWHSV) is a significant parameter of liquid adsorption.
The dynamic liquid–solid adsorption apparatus was used to examine
the effect of LWHSV at 20 °C. For an adsorbent to be considered
effective, the amount of acetaldehyde remaining should be below 0.02
(wt %).

The breakthrough curves shown in Figure 3 and the mass ratios of PO solution/adsorbent
shown in Table 5 demonstrate
that increasing the LWHSV could decrease not only the penetration
time but also the adsorption capacity of the simulated solution. Although
the penetration time when the LWHSV was 0.5 h–1 was
more than twice the penetration time at 1 h–1, the
treatment capacity of the PO solution and the adsorption capacity
of acetaldehyde were both only slightly increased. Therefore, the
optimal LWHSV should be 1 h–1 in operation.

Figure 3 Breakthrough
curves at various LWHSV.

Table 5 Effect of LWHSV on Adsorption Capacity

2	5.5	11.0	0.0541	
4	2	8.0	0.0438	
2.3 Effect of Temperature on
Adsorption
The effect of adsorbing temperature was determined
using the dynamic
liquid–solid adsorption apparatus (LWHSV = 1 h–1), and the results are illustrated in Figure 4 and Table 6.

Figure 4 Breakthrough curves under various temperatures.

Table 6 Effect of Temperature
on Adsorption

20	14	14	0.0694	
25	13	13	0.0642	
30	11	11	0.0540	
When the temperature of the adsorbent
bed was set between 15 and
20 °C, the concentration of acetaldehyde in the exudates stayed
below 0.003 (wt %) over the course of the 10 h of adsorption period,
and it ultimately reached 0.02 (wt %) after 14 h. When the adsorption
temperature was increased to 25 °C, the concentration of acetaldehyde
increased even though the penetration time was still 13 h. In addition,
when the temperature was further increased to 30 °C, the penetration
time only fell to 11 h, and the adsorption capacity of acetaldehyde
continued to decrease.

As illustrated in Table 6, the treatment capacity of the simulated
PO product decreased
as the temperature increased, and lower temperatures proved most effective
for adsorption. However, too low a temperature increases the cost
of refrigeration, meaning the optimum temperature range for absorption
is 15–20 °C.

By examining the effects of LWHSV and
temperature on absorption,
the optimum operational conditions for separating acetaldehyde from
PO are as follows: the LWHSV of the feed should be 1 h–1 and the temperature should be 15–20 °C.

In separation
processes meant for practical use, it is extremely
useful to be able to reuse the adsorbents. Desorption can not only
restore the adsorption capacity of adsorbent to the adsorbate but
also recover any adsorbate adsorbed by the adsorbent. In this way,
the desorption operation of the adsorbent is very important for the
realization of adsorption and separation.

2.4 Exploration
on the Desorption Process of Impurity
Acetaldehyde
Water vapor desorption is one of the more common
methods of molecular sieve desorption. However, in the preliminary
desorption test, a certain amount of propylene glycol was detected
in the desorption distillate. Some studies have reported that propylene
glycol is produced by PO and water even in the absence of catalyst
and hydrogen peroxide so that the propylene glycol in the desorption
distillate was the residue in the adsorbent bed and the product generated
from PO and high-temperature water vapor. Because the formation of
propylene glycol affected the yield of PO, high-temperature inert
gas was used for desorption.

After the adsorbent bed was penetrated,
the adsorbed 5A molecular sieve was subjected to thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), and the results are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 TG curve of adsorbed 5A molecular sieve.

The quality of the adsorbent decreased
rapidly as the temperature
began to rise, indicating that the adsorbed substances were blown
off after the surface of the adsorbent was wetted by the solution.
As shown in Figure 5, the quality of the adsorbent exhibited two apparent decline processes
with increasing temperature. Between 50 and 80 °C, the mass of
the adsorbent decreased by about 5.12%, which was because the adsorbed
PO was gradually desorbed. Between 160 and 200 °C, the mass of
the adsorbent decreased again, by about 9.56%, indicating that acetaldehyde
was also desorbed by nitrogen blowing when the temperature was more
than 160 °C.

The desorption experiment was carried out
on the desorption apparatus.
Nitrogen gas was introduced into the bed, and the temperature was
gradually increased. The initial temperature was 40 °C and held
for 15 min. The heating rate was 20 °C h–1,
and the desorption outflow was collected and cooled for each 20 °C
temperature increment. The composition of the desorption outflow was
analyzed by chromatography, and the results are shown in Figure 6. The substance with
a retention time of about 1 min was acetaldehyde, and the substance
with a retention time of about 3 min was PO.

Figure 6 Chromatogram of desorbed
exudate under different temperatures.

As can be seen from Figure 6, when the desorption temperature was below 80 °C,
the
chromatogram of the desorption outflow only showed the peak of PO.
As the temperature rose above 100 °C, the peak area of PO gradually
decreased, the peak of the acetaldehyde began to appear, and the peak
area of acetaldehyde increased gradually with increasing temperature.
When the temperature exceeded 160 °C, the chromatogram of the
desorption outflow only showed the peak of acetaldehyde. According
to the results of TGA and the desorption experiment, the desorption
conditions were as follows.(1) First, the adsorbent bed temperature
was increased directly to about 70 °C, and the adsorption bed
was purged with nitrogen to remove some of the adsorbed PO. Condensed
liquid could be used as a refined PO product.

(2) Then, the adsorbent bed temperature
was increased directly to 160 °C, and the adsorption bed was
purged with nitrogen to remove the acetaldehyde impurity adsorbed
by the 5A molecular sieve and the remaining PO. The condensed desorption
outflow was a solution enriched with acetaldehyde impurity, which
was subjected to a centralized adsorption and separation process.



2.5 Cyclic Desorption and Removal
of Acetaldehyde
Impurities
With a LWHSV of 1 h–1 and a
temperature of 15 °C, 120 g of 5A molecular sieve was used to
adsorb the acetaldehyde impurity from the simulated PO product solution
containing 0.5% acetaldehyde, and the adsorption outflow was collected
every 0.5 h to analyze its composition. The composition of the adsorption
outflow collected in the sample collection tank was analyzed at every
0.5 h, and the feed was stopped when the average concentration of
acetaldehyde in the adsorption outflow was close to 0.02 (wt %). After
the adsorption outflow had flown for 3 h, the desorption of adsorbent
was carried out, and then the desorbed 5A molecular sieve was used
to adsorb acetaldehyde in the simulated PO solution (the number of
cycles: N = 8). The change in acetaldehyde concentration
in the outflow from the cyclic desorption is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Concentration of acetaldehyde
in adsorbed exudate of cyclic desorption
and adsorption.

The outflow of the nth adsorption was recorded
as AEXn, the PO solution obtained by nitrogen purging
and desorption at 70 °C was recorded as DPOn, and then the fine PO product after N times of
desorption was PPON = ∑n=1NAEXn + ∑n=1NDPOn. The outflow of the nth desorption at 160 °C was recorded as Daldn, and the solution enriched with acetaldehyde after N rounds of desorption was SaldN = ∑n=1NDaldn. The acetaldehyde concentration in PPON and SaldN were measured, and the performance
of using the cyclic desorption to remove acetaldehyde impurity from
the simulated PO solution is shown in Table 7.

and Adsorption Results

8	15.0	127.0	15.0	127.0	0.0187	7.74	92.2	
As shown in Table 7, under the optimized adsorption operating
conditions, 1 g of fresh
5A molecular sieve could be used to treat 17 g of simulated PO solution.
The acetaldehyde impurity concentration in the resulting PO product
was 0.0171%, and the PO yield was 92.9%. After the first desorption,
16.5 g of simulated solution could be processed by 1 g of adsorbent,
and the processing capacity was 97.1% that of fresh adsorbent. After
eight cycles, 15 g of simulated solution could be processed by 1 g
of adsorbent in one adsorption, and the processing capacity could
still reach 86.2% that of fresh adsorbent, suggesting that the 5A
molecular sieves had a good adsorption capacity after cyclic desorption.
After eight cycles of desorption operation, the cumulative amount
of simulated PO solution that could be processed by 1 g of adsorbent
was 127 g, and the yield of PO was 92.2%. The condensate collected
each time was enriched with the impurity acetaldehyde and could be
used for centralized adsorption and separation treatment. Both PO
and acetaldehyde were recovered as products, which was conducive to
improving the yield of PO.

After eight cycles of desorption,
the concentration of acetaldehyde
impurity in the PO product was 0.0187%. The calculated removal rate
of acetaldehyde was 96.3%, which met the technical requirement for
the first level of aldehyde impurity in industrial PO. The acetaldehyde
content in SaldN was 7.74%, 15.5 times higher
than that before adsorption. The effect of the impurity enrichment
was significant. Because some of the PO was removed by the noncondensable
gases in the process of condensing, desorbing, and outflowing, the
concentration of acetaldehyde in SaldN was slightly
higher than the theoretical value.

2.6 Structural
Characterization of Adsorbent
After eight cycles of desorption
operation, the durations of adsorption
and desorption for 5A molecular sieve were 127 and 48 h, respectively.
The fresh 5A molecular sieve sample was labeled Fresh sample and the
5A molecular sieve sample after eight cycles of desorption was labeled
as Desorbed sample. As shown from the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of the two samples in Figure 8, the crystallinities of the two samples
were good and the crystal forms were similar and complete.

Figure 8 SEM photographs
of Fresh sample and Desorbed sample of 5A molecular
sieve. (a) Fresh sample and (b) Desorbed sample.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fresh 5A molecular
sieve sample and the 5A molecular sieve sample after cyclic desorption
are shown in Figure 9. As shown in the figure, the characteristic diffraction peaks of
the 5A molecular sieve crystals after cyclic desorption did not change,
indicating that the adsorption and desorption processes did not affect
the crystal structure of the molecular sieve.

Figure 9 XRD patterns of Fresh
sample and Desorbed sample of 5A molecular
sieve.

Figure 10 shows
the adsorption isotherm of N2 in fresh/desorbed 5A molecular
sieve samples. The equilibrium adsorption capacity of N2 on desorbed 5A molecular sieve was slightly lower than that of the
fresh sample.

sieves
fresh sample (■, adsorption; □, desorption) and desorbed
sample (▲, adsorption; △, desorption).

As shown in Figure 11, the pore size distribution of the adsorbent
after cyclic desorption
was similar to that of the fresh adsorbent. Based on the distributions,
there were three types of pores in the sample: the intracrystalline
pores sized around 0.5 nm, the intercrystalline pores sized 10–100
nm, and the pores sized 2–5 nm probably exist among the binder
and zeolite grains.

sample
of 5A molecular sieve. Test range for dp: 0.3–200 nm. Vp: Pore volume; dp: Pore diameter.

The specific surface area, pore volume, and average pore
size in Table 8 indicated
that the
specific surface area and pore volume of the 5A molecular sieve after
cyclic desorption were slightly decreased, and the average pore size
was slightly increased and essentially recovered to the level of fresh
adsorbent.

There were two reasons for the change in microstructure
take place
through the separation. On one hand, the acid sites of 5A molecular
sieve could catalyze the ring opening and polymerization of PO, and
the retention of polymers blocked parts of pores in smaller size.
On the other hand, partial binder, which was broken under high temperature,
led to the variation in pores sized (2–5) × 10–9 m, and it could also block some micropores.

According to the
microstructure analysis results, the micropores
of 5A sample sized (4.9–5.6) × 10–10 m were smaller than the molecular diameter of PO (6 × 10–10 m) but larger than that of acetaldehyde (5 ×
10–10 m). In this case, the acetaldehyde molecules
could enter the microscale pores of 5A but the PO molecules could
not (Figure 12). Therefore,
acetaldehyde could be filtered from PO by uniform zeolite channels
with high separation efficiency. When the samples were processed by
the variable temperature desorption by purging with N2,
the macro- and mesoscale pores benefitted the diffusion of PO molecules
with low resistance, whereas acetaldehyde in the micropores could
not be desorbed easily.

Figure 12 Selectivity of 5A molecular sieves to acetaldehyde.

The results of SEM, XRD, and microstructural
data showed that the
adsorption and desorption operations did not generally affect the
microstructure of 5A molecular sieves, which exhibited a good recovery
of the adsorption performance after desorption and retained a consistent
microstructure with the fresh adsorbent, showing that the adsorption
and desorption operations did not affect the performance of 5A molecular
sieve and the adsorbent could be reused multiple times.

3 Conclusions
Based on the results of static liquid–solid
adsorption experiments,
5A molecular sieves were chosen to separate acetaldehyde from PO.
The conditions for adsorbing acetaldehyde were optimized using dynamic
liquid–solid adsorption experiments, and the ideal conditions
were found to be an adsorption temperature between 15 and 20 °C
with an LWHSV of 1 h–1.

The desorption conditions
were determined according to the results
of thermogravimetric analysis. First, the adsorbent bed was purged
with nitrogen at 70 °C, and the condensed liquid could be used
as a refined PO product. Then, the adsorption bed was purged with
nitrogen at 160 °C to remove the acetaldehyde impurity and the
remaining PO.

After eight cycles of adsorption and desorption,
96.3% of the acetaldehyde
had been removed. The concentration of acetaldehyde impurity in the
PO product was 0.0187%, which meets the first-level technical requirements
for aldehyde content in industrial PO. The characterization of the
adsorbent showed that the adsorption and desorption procedures did
not affect the structure of the 5A molecular sieves, and the adsorbent
could be reused multiple times.

4.1 Calculating Molecular Diameter and Dipole
Moment
This study uses simulations carried out in the Materials
Studio 8.0 (MS) software package published by Accelrys Software, Inc.
Density functional theory (DFT) using DMol3 code was used to estimate
the dipole moment of the molecules. Molecular diameter simulations
were then carried out using Forcite code under the following conditions:
force field: COMPASS II,21 ensemble: NPT
and NVT, time step: 1 fs, total time: 300 ps. Ewald and atom-based
summation methods were used for electrostatic interactions and van
der Waals forces, respectively, and all atom–atom interactions
were added together to a 15.5 Å direct cutoff distance.

4.2 Static Liquid–Solid Adsorption
Figure 13 illustrates
the setup used for determining the static liquid–solid adsorption.
The apparatus featured a temperature control mechanism capable of
keeping the system within ±1.0 °C. A magnetic agitator was
used in the main body of the apparatus. The feed pump transferred
PO product into the vessel, and a condenser was placed at the connection
point.

Simulated PO product containing a predetermined percentage
of acetaldehyde
was prepared. A predetermined quantity of adsorbent was added to the
vessel before it was sealed. The temperature was set to 20 °C.
Once the temperature stabilized, the feed system was activated and
the timer was started. The samples were gathered from the condenser
outlet.

4.3 Dynamic Liquid–Solid Adsorption Experiments
The simulated PO product containing 0.5 (wt %) acetaldehyde was
prepared. A water jacket was used to control the reaction temperature,
the condenser was situated at the outflow connection point. Once the
temperature stabilized, the pump was activated, and the solution was
fed into the adsorbent bed at controlled liquid weight hourly space
velocity (LWHSV). The timer was activated when the solution first
contacted the bed. Figure 14 illustrates the dynamic liquid–solid adsorption apparatus.
The adsorbent bed was 20 mm in diameter, and 120 g of adsorbent was
used. The samples were taken every 30 min.

4.7 Characterization of Adsorbent
X-ray diffraction (XRD): The crystal
structure was determined by a Rigaku D/max-2550 VB/PC apparatus using
Cu Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM): The crystal
morphology of the product was examined using a JEOL Model JSM-6360
LV (Japan) system. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA): The curves were
recorded on a Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e (Mettler) using atmospheric nitrogen.
The microstructure of the product was analyzed on a Micromeritics
ASAP 2020 system, and parameters including Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area, pore volume, and pore length distributions in
the range of 0.3–200 nm were determined.1
