The
development of transition-metal-catalyzed borylation reactions is
of significant importance for the fields of organic synthesis and
medicinal chemistry because of the versatility of organoboron functional
groups. Herein, we report the direct decarbonylative borylation of
amides by highly selective carbon–nitrogen bond cleavage by
palladium catalysis. The approach capitalizes on the ground-state
destabilization of the amide bond in N-acyl glutarimides
to achieve Pd-catalyzed insertion into the amide N–C bond and
decarbonylation (deamidation). Mechanistic studies and the utility
of this methodology in orthogonal sequential cross-couplings of robust,
bench-stable amides are reported.

1 Introduction
Transition-metal-catalyzed
cross-coupling of amides has recently emerged as a powerful platform
for the functionalization of the traditionally inert amide bond (nN → πC=O* donation, barrier to rotation in planar amides
of 15–20 kcal/mol).1−3 The capacity of the amide bond
to support selective insertion of a transition metal into the N–C
bond by ground-state destabilization4 enables
an array of new approaches for the synthesis of important motifs in
organic synthesis.5 In this context, there
are two general pathways for metal-catalyzed cross-coupling of amides
(Figure 1): (i) direct
acyl coupling and (ii) decarbonylative cross-coupling, involving formation
of the acyl metal complex and CO extrusion to afford aryl-metal intermediates6 fulfilling the criteria of classical metal-catalyzed
cross-coupling reactions.3

Figure 1 Acyl and decarbonylative
cross-coupling of amides.

Unfortunately, although great progress has been made in acyl
cross-couplings of the amide bond,7 the
corresponding decarbonylative manifold remains much less developed.8−15 In particular, palladium-catalyzed decarbonylative cross-couplings
have remained a challenging goal, with very few examples of such reactions
(cf. Ni) reported to date.14 The versatility
of Pd catalysis,16 including the broad
industrial use of Pd-catalyzed processes,17 makes this approach attractive in decarbonylative amide bond cross-coupling.

Herein, we report the direct decarbonylative borylation of amides
by highly selective carbon–nitrogen bond cleavage by palladium
catalysis (Figure 2).18 The method represents a rare example
of using less nucleophilic Pd (cf. Ni) to promote efficient metal
insertion into the amide N–C bond and decarbonylation.6 The method capitalizes on the ground-state destabilization
of the amide bond in N-acyl glutarimides4 to achieve high selectivity of the decarbonylation.
Mechanistic studies and the utility of this methodology in orthogonal
sequential cross-couplings of robust, bench-stable amides are reported.
This user-friendly methodology can be used for the construction of
the organoboron functional group from bench-stable amides using commercially
available and air-stable reagents.19

Figure 2 Palladium-catalyzed
redox-neutral decarbonylative borylation of amides (this study).

The reaction is fundamentally
different from decarbonylative borylation of carboxylic acids reported
by our group:18f (1) the present study
addresses activation of a N–C versus O–C bond; (2) the
underlying activation principle hinges upon amide bond twist and geometric
distortion of the amide bond2b,4 (cf. steric-control
of regioselectivity and reversible insertion); (3) the catalyst system
radically differs in the use of a mono- versus bidentate phosphine
ligand; (4) amides can be prepared from fundamentally different precursors
than carboxylic acids, including primary amides. Principally, the
method constitutes the first example of Pd-catalyzed synthesis of
aryl boronates from amides, and as such represents a potentially significant
advance in the construction of C–B bonds by N–C decarbonylative
coupling akin to the classic Miyaura borylation of aryl halides and
pseudohalides.20 Given the prevalence of
amides in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry, potential future
applications range from Pd-catalyzed functionalization of biomolecules
to the synthesis of specialty and bulk chemicals.

2 Results and Discussion
Drawing from our studies in the decarbonylative
cross-coupling of amides,6a,9a,14b,14c we envisioned that Pd-catalyzed
decarbonylative borylation of rotationally inverted N-acyl glutarimides could be achieved by applying a catalyst system
that would favor decarbonylation. We commenced our studies by investigating
the cross-coupling of electronically unbiased 1-(4-toluoyl)-N-glutarimide with bis(pinacolato)diboron as the boron source
(Table 1).20

Although initial attempts were unsuccessful,
after very extensive survey of the reaction conditions, we identified
a catalyst system that provided a significant improvement in the cross-coupling,
furnishing the desired decarbonylative borylation product in 77% yield
(Table 1, entries 1–28).
Several optimization results are worth noting. The choice of the phosphane
ligand had a significant effect on the cross-coupling (entries 1–11).
We identified PCy3 as the preferred ligand for this transformation,
presumably because of facile activation of the N–C bond to
form the acyl-metal intermediate. In the evaluation of different bases,
Na2CO3 proved optimal (entries 12–17).
Various Pd catalysts were tested, and Pd(TFA)2 showed the
best activity (entries 18–24). Further improvement of the reaction
efficiency was achieved by careful adjustment of the reagent stoichiometry
(entries 25–28), presumably to match decarbonylation with the
transmetalation step. Importantly, the reaction proceeds with a complete
selectivity for N–C(O) acyl bond decarbonylation, with products
corresponding to the acyl coupling and unselective cleavage of the
endocyclic C–O bonds not observed. Furthermore, as an important
synthetic advantage, the method utilizes commercially available, bench-stable
reagents and does not require preparation of the activated boron source
or co-catalytic metal additives.9b,9f Furthermore,
we note that the cross-coupling of N-benzoylsuccinimide
proceeds in an unoptimized 45% yield.8c,8d At this stage
of reaction development, other amides have not been tested.

With the optimal conditions for cross-coupling, the scope of the
reaction was briefly investigated (Table 2). We were pleased to find that the reaction
readily tolerates unbiased neutral (entries 1–2), electron-withdrawing
(entry 3), and electron-donating (entry 4) arenes, affording the desired
organoboranes in 61–71% yields. In contrast, Ni-catalyzed cross-couplings
are often limited to the use of conjugated π-systems to favor
insertion/decarbonylation.6b,9c Electron-donating oxygen
heterocycles that are important in medicinal chemistry applications
such as dioxolane (entry 5) are well tolerated. Furthermore, amides
containing Bpin bonds are also competent substrates (entry 6), resulting
in formal double borylation by exploiting orthogonal electrophilicity
of aryl halide and amide functional groups. Notably, conjugated arenes
that are typically prone to reduction under decarbonylative conditions
also delivered the corresponding borylated products in good yields
(entries 7–8). Finally, the method could be applied to biaryl
amides to generate the desired conjugated adducts, containing synthetically
useful C–B handle for further cross-coupling functionalization
(entries 9–10, vide infra).

Borylation of Amidesa
a Conditions: amide (1.0 equiv), B2pin2 (1.2 equiv), Pd(TFA)2 (5 mol %), PCy3HBF4 (20 mol %), Na2CO3 (1.0 equiv), dioxane

While the method establishes an
important precedent in the Pd-catalyzed borylation by selective N–C
bond cleavage of amides, several limitations should be noted. (1)
At the present stage, the method is not compatible with heteroaromatic
amides (<20% yield) and ortho-substituted amides (<5% yield).
(2) Aliphatic amides undergo decarbonylation/β-hydride elimination
to give olefins. This is in agreement with a recent report by Shi
and co-workers on Ni-catalyzed retro-hydroamidocarbonylation
of aliphatic amides.9g,9h (3) In general, halogens are
not compatible with the decarbonylative cross-coupling manifold of
amides. We further note that primary and secondary amides are unreactive
under the present conditions, while N-methoxy amides
undergo decomposition by the N–O cleavage pathway. Meta-substituted
amides have not been tested because they are not at the conjugating
position. Studies to address these limitations and the design of more
selective catalyst systems are currently underway.

To gain insight
into the reaction mechanism, intermolecular competition experiments
were conducted (Scheme 1). To this end, intermolecular competition experiments with 4-substituted
amides revealed that electron-deficient amides react preferentially,
consistent with facility of metal insertion (Scheme 1A).4 Further competition
experiments established that conjugated π-systems such as naphthalene
couple preferentially (Scheme 1B). Furthermore, competition experiments established that
π-conjugated arenes react preferentially over biaryls (Scheme 1C).6b

Scheme 1 Intermolecular Competition Experiments in Decarbonylative
Borylation of Amides
Overall, the mechanistic studies highlight that (i) electrophilicity
of the amide bond and (ii) capacity of the acyl-metal intermediate
to influence the relative reactivity of amides in this decarbonylative
(deamidative) cross-coupling.

In recent years, orthogonal cross-couplings
have been an area of significant interest due to permitting versatile
disconnections in organic synthesis.21 An
attractive feature of the present methodology is the enabling nature
for orthogonal cross-couplings (Scheme 2). As shown in Scheme 2, the amide bond in N-acyl glutarimides
displays orthogonal electrophilic reactivity to the traditional Pd-catalyzed
cross-couplings.3,19,20 The amide group is not reactive toward Pd(0)-orthogonal Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reactions, highlighting a powerful opportunity for
sequential Pd-catalyzed C(sp2)–C(sp2)
cross-coupling/Pd-catalyzed decarbonylative cross-coupling in organic
synthesis.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have documented the first palladium-catalyzed decarbonylative borylation
of amides by selective carbon–nitrogen cleavage for the synthesis
of versatile organoboranes. The method exploits the ground-state destabilization
of the amide bond in N-acyl glutarimides to achieve
Pd-catalyzed insertion into the amide N–C bond and decarbonylation.
Although the yields are good to modest, the reaction is synthetically
useful because it employs commercially available and air-stable reagents.
Furthermore, the method sets an important precedent for decarbonylative
borylation of amides using versatile Pd-catalysis. Moreover, the potential
of the amide N–C bond disconnection has been demonstrated in
orthogonal cross-couplings using palladium. Additional studies directed
at decarbonylative cross-coupling of amide electrophiles, including
extension to other nucleophiles, as well as structural mechanistic
investigations and studies on the development of improved reaction
conditions and catalyst systems are in progress in our laboratory
and will be reported in due course.
