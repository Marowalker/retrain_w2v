Hydrothermal experiments aiming at
the crystal growth of stishovite
near ambient pressure and temperature were performed in conventional
autoclave systems using 1 M (molar) NaOH, 0.8 M Na2CO3, and pure water as a mineralizing agent. It was found that
the hydrothermal metastability of stishovite and coesite is very different
from the thermal metastability in all mineralizing agents and that
because of this fact crystals could not be grown. While stishovite
and coesite are thermally metastable up to 500 and >1000 °C,
respectively, their hydrothermal metastability is below 150 and 200
°C, respectively. The thermally induced conversion of stishovite
and coesite leads to amorphous products, whereas the hydrothermally
induced conversion leads to crystalline quartz. Both stishovite and
coesite are minerals occurring in nature where they can be exposed
to hydrothermal conditions. The low hydrothermal stability of these
phases may be an important factor to explain the rarity of these minerals
in nature.

==== Body
Introduction
Stishovite,
a high-pressure polymorph of SiO2 with a
rutile structure, is the hardest oxidic material with a hardness of
about 33 GPa and has been the subject of intense studies.1−14 Despite this extraordinary property and its thermal metastability
up to ca. 500 °C at ambient pressure, it has not found applications
as an ultrahard material for abrasive, cutting, and ceramics applications.
The reason is that stishovite is thermodynamically stable only above
ca. 8 GPa, which poses severe limitations with regard to the scalability
of the synthesis. Thus, an economic synthesis of stishovite is currently
unavailable.

Kinetically controlled synthesis allows for the
access of materials
far from chemical equilibrium. Diamond has been produced in kinetically
controlled chemical vapor deposition processes from diamond seed crystals
near or below ambient pressure.15−17 We set out to develop a kinetically
controlled synthesis for stishovite near ambient pressure using stishovite
seed crystals. The fact that stishovite is an oxide inspired us to
conceive a kinetically controlled hydrothermal synthesis from the
solution phase in a temperature gradient near ambient pressure. Essentially,
this synthesis would work analogously to the commercial quartz growth
process; however, instead of quartz seed crystals, stishovite seeds
would be used. Industrially, quartz is hydrothermally grown at pressures
of ca. 0.1–0.2 GPa and temperatures of ca. 300–350 °C
in temperature gradients between 2 and 25 °C using a mineralizer,
typically a 1 M NaOH or a 0.8 M Na2CO3 solution.18 At that temperature, stishovite is known to
be thermally metastable. If stishovite was also hydrothermally metastable,
conversion of the stishovite into a lower-density phase could be avoided,
and stishovite may be grown as a metastable phase from a supersaturated
solution. If not, fundamental insights into the hitherto unknown hydrothermal
metastability of stishovite would be obtained.

Experiments, Results, and
Discussion
To test this hypothesis, we first synthesized
stishovite seed crystals
thermodynamically controlled at 12 GPa and 400 °C from SBA-16,
an ordered mesoporous form of silica. These conditions allow for the
synthesis of discrete, nonagglomerated, nanosized (ca. 300 nm) single
crystals of stishovite that are described in structural detail in
a previous publication.19 The use of nanosized
single crystals seemed particularly attractive to us because of the
high surface-to-volume ratio of the nanocrystals. In an initial experiment,
2.8 mg of the nanocrystals was pressed into a silver crucible (8 mm
length and 5 mm diameter) having four 1 mm diameter holes drilled
halfway around the side, and a silver lid was placed on top of the
crucible. This setup ensured that the seeds were accessible by the
solution, but the seeds could not be washed out by convection (it
was verified in a reference experiment using quartz powder as seeds
that this setup is suitable for crystal growth). The crucible was
placed in the growth zone of a custom-made autoclave (High Pressure
Equipment Company) made of 4340 alloy steel having a modified Bridgman-type
seal. The autoclave body was 41.61 cm (16.38 in.) tall and had an
outer diameter of 6.35 cm (2.50 in.) and a volume of 100 mL. Its upper
pressure limit was 0.2 GPa (30 000 psi) at 400 °C. To
ensure safe operation, the autoclave was housed in a detonation-proof
chamber (Fluitron). The temperatures in the dissolution and the growth
zone were measured with two J-type thermocouples, which were inserted
into the walls of the autoclave body. The autoclave was connected
to a Viatran XL 570 pressure transmitter via a ca. 50 cm long stainless-steel
high-pressure tubing having an outer diameter of 0.32 cm (1/8 in.).
The autoclave was heated with two 17.78 cm (7 in.) long band heaters
separated by a mica sheet as well as a bottom heater underneath the
autoclave. The heaters were heated with three programmable proportional–integral–derivative
temperature controllers having a maximum power of 400 W each. The
setup is shown schematically in Figure S1. Quartz particles with a diameter of around 5 mm (donated by Sawyers,
Inc) were used as the nutrient, and 1 M NaOH was chosen as the mineralizer.
A temperature of 375 °C was chosen for the dissolution zone,
and the temperature of the growth zone was 350 °C. The heating
rate was 4 °C/min. The two zones were separated by a baffle with
a 10% opening. The fill rate of the autoclave was 75%, the final pressure
in the autoclave was 43.49 MPa (6308 psi), and the growth time was
48 h (Table S1). After the experiment was
completed and the autoclave had cooled down, it was opened. The weight
of the sample in the silver capsule was determined, and the phase
was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku MiniFlex
II microdiffraction system with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ
= 0.15405 nm). It was found that the mass of the sample had slightly
decreased by 0.2 mg (7%), suggesting that crystal growth did not occur
(Table S1). XRD showed reflections for
quartz except a very small peak at 30.1° 2θ, which is the
100% peak for stishovite (Figure 1a). In view of these results, we decided to lower the
growth temperature to see if the hydrothermal metastability was achieved
then and if crystal growth rates were large enough to measurably grow
stishovite. Additional experiments were performed at growth temperatures
of 300, 250, and 160 °C. For experiments performed at growth
temperatures of 300 and 250 °C, the temperature gradient was
25 °C. At 160 °C, the maximum temperature gradient that
could be achieved was 15 °C (Table S1). At 300 and 250 °C, well-crystalline quartz was obtained,
whereas at 160 °C, the stishovite became largely noncrystalline
(Figure 1b–d).
The results show that under all the chosen hydrothermal conditions,
stishovite was not metastable but converted into quartz. This behavior
is different from the thermal behavior of stishovite near ambient
pressure. Under purely thermal conditions, stishovite amorphizes at
the temperature of ca. 500 °C.

A 1 M sodium hydroxide solution is strongly basic.
We hypothesized
that the strong basicity of the solution may be the reason for the
low hydrothermal stability of stishovite. Na2CO3 is also known as a good mineralizer in quartz crystal growth but
is a far weaker base. We therefore decided to replace the 1 M NaOH
solution by a 0.8 M Na2CO3 solution in our experiments.
A dissolution temperature of 275 °C and a growth temperature
of 250 °C were chosen for an initial growth experiment in 0.8
M Na2CO3 (Table S2). The XRD pattern of the material obtained after a growth time of
2 days revealed well-crystalline quartz, showing that the hydrothermal
metastability of stishovite in 0.8 M Na2CO3 is
also lower than the thermal metastability (Figure 2a). The mass of the recovered sample significantly
increased by 139%; however, this mass increase is not due to crystal
growth. It was noticed that a gel-like material, presumably amorphous
silica, precipitated out of the supersaturated solution upon cooling
covering the interior of the autoclave crucible and seed crystal surfaces,
which explains the mass increase. To get further insights into the
hydrothermal stability of stishovite in Na2CO3 solution, we carried out additional experiments at growth temperatures
of 150, 111, and 105 °C and dissolution temperatures of 175,
137, and 125 °C, respectively (Table S2). At 150 °C, semicrystalline quartz was obtained together with
small residual amounts of stishovite (Figure 2b). The semicrystalline nature of the product
together with the different intensity ratios of the diffraction peaks
indicates that the phase transformation into quartz is still incomplete
at this temperature. At 111 and 105 °C, XRD showed stishovite
only, showing that the hydrothermal metastability of stishovite is
between 111 and 150 °C (Figure 2c). A mass increase of 45, 16, and 25% was seen for
these experiments, respectively. Similar to the experiment performed
at 250 °C, it was noticed that a gel-like material had precipitated,
which suggests that the mass increase was not due to crystal growth.
To get further insights, we performed transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) on the material obtained at 111 °C (Figure 3). The TEM images showed that the crystal
sizes did not significantly change during the experiment (ca. 100–400
nm), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) confirmed the crystallinity
of the investigated particles. A very thin (∼5 nm) layer with
brighter electronic contrast was noticed on the surface of the crystals,
indicating that either a lower-density noncrystalline phase had precipitated
on the surface of the crystals or the surface of the stishovite crystals
had begun to convert into a lower-density noncrystalline phase. Overall,
TEM supports that the stishovite crystals did not grow.

Further experiments were carried out in pure water as the
mineralizer
(Table S3). At a growth temperature of
250 °C, the stishovite became completely noncrystalline (Figure 4a). A mass loss of
88% was measured, showing that a substantial amount of stishovite
had actually dissolved. Further experiments were carried out at growth
temperatures of 150 and 100 °C. In these cases, pure stishovite
was obtained according to XRD (Figure 4b,c). This result shows that the hydrothermal stability
of stishovite in water is slightly higher than in Na2CO3 and NaOH. For the experiment at 150 °C, a mass loss
of 69% was observed, indicating stishovite dissolution. For the experiment
at 100 °C, there was neither a significant mass increase nor
loss, showing that stishovite remains practically inert at this temperature.

Because of the limited hydrothermal metastability of stishovite,
it was decided to grow stishovite in extreme temperature gradients
(>50 °C) at temperatures at which stishovite is hydrothermally
stable. The hypothesis was that the large temperature gradient may
lead to sufficiently large crystal growth rates because of the extreme
oversaturation of the solution. NaOH (1 M) was used as the mineralizer
because it is known that spontaneous nucleation of crystals from such
a solution does not occur, and there is no precipitation of noncrystalline
silica from the supersaturated solution upon cooling. To achieve a
very large temperature gradient at the growth temperature of ∼120
°C, the growth zone needed to be actively cooled. To achieve
this, a 0.635 cm (1/4 in.) outer diameter copper tubing was wound
around the growth zone of the autoclave and connected to a Neslab
RTE 111 chilling apparatus with a cooling capacity of 375 W (BTU/h),
and the apparatus was set to the lowest temperature, which is −30
°C. A shorter 8.89 cm (3.5 in.) long band heater was used to
heat the dissolution zone. The distance between the cooling coil and
the band heater was 5.08 cm (2 in.). The setup is schematically shown
in Figure S2. The maximum dissolution temperature
that was achieved at a growth temperature of 116 °C was 230 °C,
corresponding to a temperature gradient of 114 °C (Table S4). However, even at this very large temperature
gradient, no measurable stishovite crystal growth was achieved.

Coesite is another high-pressure polymorph of silicon dioxide.
In contrast to stishovite, which has octahedral SiO6 building
units, it is made of interconnected SiO4 tetrahedra. The
thermal metastability of coesite (>1000 °C) is known to be
much
higher than that of stishovite (∼500 °C).20 Our hypothesis was that because of the higher thermal metastability
of coesite, the hydrothermal metastability of coesite may also be
higher and that this may allow for the kinetically controlled hydrothermal
growth of coesite near ambient pressure at temperatures sufficiently
high to achieve reasonably large crystal growth rates. Moreover, coesite
is thermodynamically stable already from ca. 2 GPa, and thus, the
growth conditions would not be far from equilibrium. This is an important
consideration because the free energy of the supersaturated solution
must be higher than that of the seed crystals to produce a driving
force for crystal growth. In an initial experiment, at a growth temperature
of 200 °C and a temperature gradient of 50 °C, we found
that coesite was completely converted into quartz within 24 h in a
1 M NaOH solution (Figure 5a). At 190 °C, there was the still conversion into quartz,
but at 180 °C, coesite remained stable (Figure 5b,c). No crystal growth occurred, showing
that crystal growth rates are too small at the temperature coesite
is hydrothermally metastable (Table S5).

Conclusions
In conclusion, our study
is the first report on the hydrothermal
metastability of coesite and stishovite near ambient pressure. Previously,
only the thermal metastability was known. It was found that the hydrothermal
metastability of these phases is significantly different from their
thermal metastability. While stishovite and coesite are thermally
metastable up to 500 and >1000 °C, respectively, their hydrothermal
metastability is below 150 and 200 °C, respectively. The thermally
induced conversion of stishovite and coesite leads to amorphous products,
whereas the hydrothermally induced conversion usually leads to crystalline
quartz. The difference between the thermal and the hydrothermal metastability
is explained by the fact that an aqueous solution can act as a phase
transformation catalyst because water (and base) can chemically attack
SiO2. Both stishovite and coesite are minerals occurring
in nature where they can be exposed to hydrothermal conditions. The
low hydrothermal stability of these phases may be an important factor
to explain the rarity of these minerals in nature. Coesite and stishovite
are mostly formed because of meteorite impacts, which can lead to
hydrothermal conditions. Because the high pressure produced by the
shock of the impact can return to ambient conditions more quickly
than the high temperature, any coesite and stishovite formed due to
this shock may be exposed to hydrothermal conditions near ambient
pressure. Our data indicate that minutes to hours are sufficient to
convert coesite and stishovite to quartz at temperatures as low as
150 °C. At room temperature, it can be assumed that coesite and
stishovite are near indefinitely metastable.
