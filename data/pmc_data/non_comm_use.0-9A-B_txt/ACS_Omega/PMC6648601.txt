The literature data
on solubilities and water–solvent partition
coefficients have been used to obtain properties or “Absolv
descriptors” for zwitterionic α-aminoacids: glycine,
α-alanine (α-aminopropanoic acid), α-aminobutanoic
acid, norvaline (α-aminopentanoic acid), norleucine (α-aminohexanoic
acid), valine (α-amino-3-methylbutanoic acid), leucine (α-amino-4-methylpentanoic
acid), and α-phenylalanine. Together with equations that we
have previously constructed, these descriptors can be used to estimate
further solubilities and partition coefficients in a variety of organic
solvents and in water–methanol and water–ethanol mixtures.
It is shown that equations for neutral solutes are inadequate for
the description of solubilities and partition coefficients for these
α-aminoacids, and our equations developed for use with both
neutral and ionic solutes must be used. The Absolv descriptors include
those for hydrogen-bond acidity, A, and hydrogen-bond
basicity, B. We find that both of these descriptors are
far smaller in value than those for compounds that contain the corresponding
ionic groups. Thus, A for α-alanine is 0.28, but A for the ethylammonium cation is 1.31; B for
α-alanine is 0.83, and yet B for the acetate anion
is no less than 2.93. The additional descriptors that we developed
for equations that involve ions, J+ and J–, are very significant for the α-aminoacids,
although numerically smaller than for ionic species such as EtNH3+ and CH3CO2–.

==== Body
Introduction
The α-aminoacids are one of the
most important series of
compounds in the chemical and biological sciences, and there has been
a very large number of experimental and theoretical studies on this
series. Campen et al.1 have shown that
there are some 517 distinct scales of aminoacid properties. Even so,
there are notable omissions in α-aminoacid properties. The most
common methods2−4 for the estimation of water–solvent partition
coefficients only apply to the water–wet octanol system and
not to any other water–solvent system. The EPI method for the
estimation of solubility4 applies only
to solubility in water and not to any other solvent. Most surprisingly,
there are no estimations of the hydrogen-bond acidity or of the hydrogen-bond
basicity of α-aminoacids. The hydrogen-bond acidity of glycine
might be supposed to be close to that of the ethylammonium cation,
and the corresponding hydrogen-bond basicity close to that of the
acetate anion, but no information on these important hydrogen-bond
properties is available.

It is our aim to use known physicochemical
properties of zwitterionic
α-aminoacids such as water–solvent partitions and solubilities
in a range of solvents to obtain “descriptors” of these
aminoacids. Together with equations that we have previously obtained,
these descriptors can be used to estimate further partition coefficients
in various water–solvent systems and further solubilities in
various solvents. Crucially, these descriptors include the hydrogen-bond
acidity and hydrogen-bond basicity so that it will then be possible
to compare values for α-aminoacids with those for other species,
both charged and uncharged.

Methods
Over the past few years,
we have developed a system of properties
or descriptors of solute molecules, known as Abraham descriptors or
as Absolv descriptors,5 and have constructed
a data base of these solute properties, now available in the public
domain.6 In conjunction with this data
base, we have assembled a complementary set of equations for physicochemical
and biological properties of solutes, so that a combination of solute
descriptors and equation coefficients can be used to predict various
physicochemical and biological properties, as set out in a number
of reviews.7−11 This work3−11 dealt only with neutral species, but was extended to cover charged
solutes, specifically ions such as K+ and Cl– and ionic species, defined as protonated base cations and deprotonated
acid anions,12−21 as recently reviewed.22 The total method,
for neutral and ionic species, has already been applied to a number
of systems.23−30 Although we had descriptors for a large number of charged species,22 we have not investigated the α-aminoacids
that are electrically neutral but with an internal charge separation,
that is, zwitterions. Our study on betaine, Me3N+CH2CO2–, showed31 that it could not be treated as a “neutral”
molecule, but that it was essential to include ionic descriptors.
Since our analysis of betaine was reasonably successful, we applied
the same method to the α-aminoacids.

Our general method
for the analysis of neutral solutes makes use
of the two linear free energy relationships, eqs 1 and 2. 1   2  Equation 1 is used when the dependent
variable, SP, refers to a property
such as a water–solvent partition coefficient, as log P, for a series of solutes in a given system. Equation 2 is used when SP refers to
a gas to system partition, as a log K value,
where K is the gas to system partition coefficient.

The independent variables in eqs 1 and 2 are solute descriptors
as follows:7−11E is the solute excess molar refractivity in units
of (cm3 mol–1)/10, S is
the solute dipolarity/polarizability, A and B are the overall or summation hydrogen-bond acidity and basicity, V is the McGowan characteristic volume in units of (cm3 mol–1)/100, and L is the logarithm
of the gas–hexadecane partition coefficient, at 298 K. The
coefficients in eqs 1 and 2 are obtained by multiple linear regression
analysis and serve to characterize the system under consideration.
In the case of ionic solutes, we could not use eq 2 and so only eq 1 is relevant. This equation can be extended to ionic
solutes by incorporation of two new terms, as in eq 3. The j+J+ term refers to cations, and the j–J– term refers
to anions. Cations have J– = 0, anions
have J+ = 0 and neutral compounds have J– = J+ = 0, so
that the equation coefficients c, e, s, a, b, and v are the same for neutral molecules, ions, and ionic species.
Thus, for neutral molecules, eq 3 reverts to eq 1. 3  To apply eqs 1 or 3 to
a given α-aminoacid,
values of the dependent variable, SP are needed. The most direct source
is a directly determined water–solvent partition coefficient, P, as log P, although for many α-aminoacids,
partition coefficients are restricted to the water–wet octanol
system, Poct/w. Partition coefficients
can also be obtained indirectly from solubilities, in mol dm–3, in water, Cw, and a given (usually
dry) solvent, Cs, through eq 4. 4  Then, if enough values of log P, direct or indirect, are available for a given α-aminoacid,
they can be combined with the corresponding equations, eq 3, and the unknown descriptors calculated
by solving the set of simultaneous equations. The Microsoft “Solver”
add-on is particularly useful, and any set of simultaneous equations
can be solved to give a “best-fit” solution. Coefficients
in eq 3 for the ionic
equations that we have obtained so far are given in Table 1.

Results
We first studied the homologous series of α-amino-n-carboxylic acids, because we thought that it is reasonable
to expect that the various solute descriptors would vary regularly
with the number of carbon atoms in the aminoacids, and that this would
help in the assignment of descriptors.

Glycine
Values
of directly determined water to (wet)
octan-1-ol and water to (wet) butan-1-ol are available.2,32 We have the coefficients in eq 3 for partition into both of these solvents, see Table 1. There are a large number of
recorded solubilities for glycine in water and various dry solvents,
as given in Table 2(2,32−46) in terms of log C, where C is the molar solubility. There are some very large discrepancies
among the recorded solubilities. For example, values of log C vary from −1.959 to −3.638 in solvent
propan-1-ol and from −2.40 to −3.745 for in solvent
propan-2-ol. In Table 2, we give the corresponding partition coefficients derived through eq 4, with log Cw taken as 0.49; Cw is the
molar solubility in water at 298 K.32−39 The values of log P obtained through eq 4 are also in Table 2, and it is these values that
we use to derive descriptors for glycine.

in the ionic equation, eq 3, see Table 3. We
combined the various solubilities to obtain log P values from methanol to water–methanol mixtures and from
water to water–ethanol mixtures, using our selected log P values for partition to 100% methanol and 100% ethanol,
for consistency. The log P values that we
obtained are in Table 4.

There were a number
of solvents, 2-methoxyethanol, dioxane, and
1,2-dimethoxyethane, for which we had coefficients only for neutral
species. However, we were still left with log P values for 35 solvents or solvent mixtures. The log P values for water to propanone and water to butan-1-ol
(and hence the corresponding solubilities) were quite out of line,
and so we were left with 33 values. We obtained a value of E = 0.476 for the neutral species NH2CH2CO2H from a refractive index calculated by the ChemSketch program.3 Judging from our results on base cations and
acid anions, we can take E for the zwitterionic species
as that for the neutral species. Similarly, we take V = 0.5646 for the neutral species as that for the zwitterion. Then,
we have five descriptors, S, A, B, J+, and J– to obtain from 33 simultaneous equations. The descriptors in Table 5 yield a standard
deviation SD = 0.241 log units between observed and calculated log P values. The number of data points used is N. In view of
the large discrepancies in the solubilities of glycine, the SD value
is as small as could reasonably be expected. The calculated log P values for the water–methanol and water–ethanol
mixtures are in Table 4, and the calculated log P values for the
organic solvents are in Table 2. We also used exactly the same 33 equations to obtain descriptors
through the neutral eq 1, that is with j+ and j– taken as zero. The SD now rises considerably
to 0.348 log units, see Table 5.

α-Alanine (α-Aminopropanoic
Acid)
For α-alanine,
there is also a substantial data available. As for glycine, water
to (wet) octan-1-ol and water to (wet) butan-1-ol partition coefficients
are known.2,32 The solubilities of l-α-alanine
and dl-α-alanine in water are almost the same, with
log Cw = 0.260.34−37,39,44−48 Solubilities are also known in organic solvents,34−36,38,39,41−48 water–methanol mixtures33,36 and water–ethanol
mixtures.33,36,37 We used log Cw = 0.260 to convert solubilities into values
of log P through eq 4, see Tables 6 and 7. We obtained E = 0.460 and V = 0.7055 as for glycine and then had
five descriptors to obtain from 30 simultaneous equations. The best-fit
descriptors are in Table 5. Together with the corresponding equations for log P, these yield the calculated log P values in Tables 6 and 7. The descriptors in Table 5 give SD = 0.206 log units between
observed and calculated log P values. If the
neutral equation, eq 1 is used, the SD is considerably increased to 0.345 log units, see Table 5.

α-Aminobutanoic Acid
There is less data for α-aminobutanoic
acid, but log P values into wet octan-1-ol2 and wet butan-1-ol are available,32 and solubilities in water,45,46,49,50 organic solvents,41,42,44,45 and water–ethanol37 mixtures have
been determined for dl-α-aminobutanoic acid. Values
of log C and derived values of log P are in Table 8, the latter using a value of 0.333 for log Cw for water. There are 17 values of log P, for which we have the corresponding equation coefficients.
We take E = 0.455 and V = 0.8464, obtained
as for glycine and α-alanine. If we omit the value for dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), we are left with a set of 17 simultaneous equations.
These yield the descriptors given in Table 5 and the calculated values of log P, as shown in Table 8. The observed and calculated log P values yield SD = 0.180 log units. If the set of 17 simultaneous
equations is solved using the neutral equations, the SD rises to 0.331
log units, with the descriptors given in Table 5.

Norvaline (α-Aminopentanoic
Acid)
Values of log P from water
to wet butan-1-ol and wet octan-1-ol are known
for norvaline,2,32 and solubilities of dl-norvaline are available in water, log Cw = −0.168,44,45 and in a limited number
of organic solvents,41,42,44−46 as shown in Table 9. Wang et al.51 have determined
solubilities of l-norvaline in methanol, ethanol, and their
aqueous mixture but not in water itself. Klimov and Deshcherevsky52 determined that log Cw = −0.153 for l-norvaline, and we obtain
values of log P using log Cw = −0.168 and −0.153 for dl-norvaline
and l-norvaline, respectively, see Table 9. We take E = 0.454 and V = 0.9873; if the datum in DMSO is neglected, we have 27
equations and derive the remaining descriptors, see Table 5, with an SD of 0.138 log units.
If the neutral equations are used to obtain descriptors, the SD rises
to 0.214 log units, see Table 5.

Norleucine
(α-Aminohexanoic Acid)
Values of log P from water to wet butan-1-ol and wet octan-1-ol are known
for norleucine,2 and solubilities are available
for dl-norleucine in water–ethanol mixtures38 and in a few organic solvents,38 as set out in Table 10. We took E = 0.449 and V = 1.1282, calculated as before. Then, using log Cw = −1.062, we obtained the given log P (obs) values. The log P value
for propanone was considerably out of line, but the remaining log P values yielded 17 simultaneous equations from which we
could calculate the descriptors shown in Table 5. The set of equations and calculated solute
descriptors yield observed and calculated values of log P with SD = 0.153 log units.

Valine (α-Amino-3-methylbutanoic Acid)
log P values for partition to wet octan-1-ol
(−2.26)
and to wet butan-1-ol (−1.14) are known,2,32 and
solubilities are available in water, organic solvents,34,35,37,43 water–methanol,34,36,45 and water–ethanol mixtures.37,53 The solubilities
of l-valine and dl-valine differ somewhat. In water,
values of log C are −0.122,35,36,43 and −0.243.37 However, log P values
to water–ethanol mixtures as calculated from solubilities of l-valine and dl-valine in water and water–ethanol
mixtures37,53 are essentially the same for both isomers,
as expected. In Table 11 are given values of log P as obtained from
solubilities of l-valine in water and organic solvents or
from solubilities of dl-valine in water and organic solvents.
The total of log P values is in Table 11. We took E = 0.439 and V = 0.9873, as before, and used
27 simultaneous equations to obtain the descriptors given in Table 5; the value of A = 0.32 was fixed by comparison to other aminoacids. For
the 27 observed and calculated values of log P in Table 11, SD
= 0.204 log units.

Leucine (α-Amino-4-methylpentanoic Acid)
Dey
and Lahiri36 report solubilities of l-leucine in water, water–methanol, water–ethanol,
and water-propan-2-ol mixtures. The derived log P values for water to pure solvents are in Table 12. Cohn et al.37 also determined solubilities of l-leucine in water–ethanol
mixtures, but the value of log P from water
to ethanol is −2.13, as compared to that of −1.54 by
Dey and Larhiri.36 Pal et al.35 listed similar data in water-tert–butanol mixtures, and the log P value
from water to tert-butanol itself is in Table 12. Also given2,32 are log P values from water to wet octan-1-ol
and wet butan-1-ol. Gekko54 has determined
solubilities in water–methanol mixtures, and his values in
water and pure methanol lead to a log P value
of −1.05, as compared to the value of −1.48 from Dey
and Lahiri.36

The derived log P values in Table 12 for partition from water to
methanol and ethanol are very inconsistent. In addition, those for
partition into propan-2-ol and tert-butanol are far
out of line by comparison with those for the other α-aminoacids.
The only way that we could assign descriptors to leucine was on the
basis of the already obtained descriptors for the other α-aminoacids
listed in Table 5.
The suggested descriptors for leucine are in Table 5 and lead to the calculated log P values in Table 12. Clearly, more data on leucine are needed.

Phenylalanine
Solubilities have been determined for
both l-phenylalanine and dl-phenylalanine. In water,
at 298 K, values of log Cw are
−0.762 for l-phenylalanine33−36,54,55 and −1.065 for dl-phenylalanine.56−59 We use the values of log Cw =
−0.762 and −1.065 to convert solubilities of l-phenylalanine33,54 and dl-phenylalanine40 in solvents to the corresponding log P values; details are in Table 13. Gomaa60 has
determined solubilities of phenylalanine in several solvents. There
is no indication of which isomer was used, but we have simply calculated
log P values from the given solubilities in
solvents and in water, see Table 13. There should be no difference in the log P values for l-phenylalanine and dl-phenylalanine

We calculated E = 1.15 in the same way
as for glycine,
and we took V = 1.3133 the same as the corresponding
neutral species. We have data for 30 solvents, including aprotic solvents,
and derive the descriptors in Table 5 with an SD of 0.144 log units as between observed
(taken) and calculated log P values. If the
analysis is carried out with the neutral equations, SD rises to 0.330
log units.

Discussion
There are a number of
other zwitterionic α-aminoacids to
those in Table 5 for
which solubility data are available. The latter invariably refer only
to hydroxylic solvents and water–solvent mixtures. In these
cases, the set of simultaneous equations for a given aminoacid can
still be solved, but there then exists numerous solutions that have
nearly the same statistical quality, so that no definite set of descriptors
can be obtained. Unless data in a number of aprotic solvents such
as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, and also propylene
carbonate are available, it is difficult to use our method of simultaneous
equations to determine descriptors. Exceptions are norleucine, valine,
and leucine that are structurally so close to other α-aminoacids, Table 5, that it is possible
to estimate some of their descriptors.

One complication is that
many α-aminoacids exist as optical
isomers (especially as the l- or dl-forms). Although
the l- and d-isomers will have the same solubilities,
the dl-form may have different solubilities to the l- and d-forms. Then, application of eq 4 requires that log Cs and log Cw refer
to the same isomer. Of course any value of log P obtained through eq 4 or directly determined will be the same for an l- or dl-isomer.

An objective of this work was to establish
if the properties of
α-aminoacids could reasonably be estimated using our simple
equation for neutral species, eq 1, or whether the more complicated “ionic” equation, eq 3 should be used. For the
five α-aminoacids in Table 5 for which we have reliable descriptors, the average
SD as between observed and calculated values of log P is 0.182 log units, which suggests that we can predict
further values of log P to about 0.20 log
units. Once a given value of log P has been
estimated through a combination of descriptors and equation coefficients,
the corresponding value of log Cs can be obtained from log Cw, eq 4. If the neutral equation eq 1 is used, the average SD
for the five α-aminoacids rises to 0.314 log units. However,
we expect that the SD from an equation with five descriptors will
be larger than the SD from an equation with seven descriptors. We,
therefore, carried out a multiple linear regression of the 33 log P values for glycine against the five solvent descriptors E, S, A, B, and V and found that the Fisher F-statistic was
172.2. For a regression against the seven solvent descriptors E, S, A, B, V, J+, and J–, we found that F = 206.0, so that even when taking
into account the extra two descriptors, the equation with J+ and J– is preferred.
We conclude that use of eq 3 with the J+ and J– descriptors is necessary for the analysis of partition
and solubility of α-aminoacids by our method.

In the solution
of a set of simultaneous equations for a given
solute, the solute descriptors are all determined in the same analysis,
so that the individual errors in the descriptors are not obtained.
However, the overall errors in the analyses, Table 5, are larger than the errors we usually find
with neutral compounds for which we have estimated descriptor errors
to be around 0.02 units. We suggest that descriptor errors for the
α-aminoacids could be 0.03–0.04 units. The obtained descriptors
for α-aminoacids, Table 5, are of some interest, especially in that the α-aminoacids
appear to have remarkably small values of the hydrogen-bond descriptors A and B. It is useful to compare some of the
α-aminoacid descriptors with those for other charged species,
as shown in Table 14, with α-alanine as an example. There are some very notable
differences between the α-alanine descriptors and those for
charged species that might be suitable models. Both α-alanine
and the ethylammonium cation contain the C-NH3+ group, and yet A is only 0.28 for α-alanine as
against 1.31 for the cation. α-Alanine, betaine, and the acetate
ion all contain the C-CO2– group, and
yet B values are 0.83, 2.00, and 2.93, respectively.
The hydrogen-bond acidity and hydrogen-bond basicity of α-alanine
are far less than expected by comparison to these particular charged
species. Alagona et al.63 have used the
Monte Carlo simulation to show that glycine has an intramolecular
hydrogen bond and a quantum mechanics, molecular mechanics simulation
by Tuňón et al.64 yields
a similar result. The existence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond
would at least partially explain the relatively small values of A and B for the α-aminoacids. It is interesting
that betaine, which would not be expected to have an intramolecular
bond, has a much larger value of B than have the α-aminoacids.
Tsai et al.65 have suggested that zwiterionic
α-aminoacids are far less hydrophilic than expected
from the presence of two charged groups; the small values of A and B would certainly lead to this result.
α-Phenylalanine has substantially larger values of A and B than the other aminoacids in Table 14. Possibly, the presence of
the phenyl group interrupts the intramolecular bond that reduces the
values of A and B in the other α-aminoacids.
This interruption results in a B-value just short of
that in betaine, which can have no intramolecular bond.

As we have shown, above, the ionic descriptors J+ and J– are very
significant
for the α-aminoacids, although they are numerically smaller
than those for the ionic species EtNH3+ and
MeCO2–. This parallels the situation
with the descriptors A and B and suggests
again that the charged groups in the α-aminoacids
cannot be compared directly with those in typical anionic and cationic
species.

A feature of the log P values
for the α-aminoacids
is that the observed log P is more negative
than calculated in mixtures with a high proportion of alcohols and
the observed log P is more positive than calculated
in mixtures with a high proportion of water. It is worth pointing
out that these differences are quite small. For the glycine/methanol/water
system, the errors between observed and calculated log P are −0.18 log units (95% methanol) and + 0.06 log
units (10% methanol), see Table 4. For methanol itself, observed values of log P range from −2.43 to −2.86, a difference
of 0.43 log units, and for ethanol itself, observed values range from
−2.56 to −3.90, a difference of no less than 1.34 log
units (Table 2). In
view of the errors in observed values, we just note the (rather small)
variation of log P with alcohol/water content.
