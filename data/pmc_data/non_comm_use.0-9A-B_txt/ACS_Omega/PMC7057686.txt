Perovskite solar
cells based on multiple cations have shown excellent
optoelectronic properties with high power conversion efficiency. Herein,
the structural, electronic, and optical properties of mixed-cation
mixed-metal perovskites MA1–xCsxPb0.25Sn0.75I3 were studied by employing the first-principles calculations for
the first time. Our calculated results reveal that these perovskite
materials possess direct band gaps in the range of 1.0–1.3
eV. Moreover, these compounds show excellent photovoltaic performance
in terms of strong optical absorption coefficients compared with MAPbI3. Particularly, they also exhibit good structural stability
and decrement of lead content. These results demonstrated that mixed-cation
mixed-metal perovskites may be potential candidates for high-efficiency
light-absorbing materials.

Introduction
Lead halide perovskites have emerged as
highly promising materials
for photovoltaic applications in the past 10 years because of their
excellent properties such as suitable band gap, strong optical absorption,
high carrier mobility, and long charge-carrier diffusion length.1−4 The certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) was rapidly increased
from 3.8% in 20095 to 25.2% in 2019,6 which is comparable to conventional silicon solar
cells. The perovskite structure has a general chemical formula of
ABX3, where A is usually occupied by monovalent cations
such as Cs+, CH3NH3+ (MA+), or CH(NH2)2+ (FA+), B is occupied by divalent metal cations such as Pb2+, Sn2+, or Ge2+, and X is occupied by halide
anions such as Cl–, Br–, or I–. Unfortunately, the perovskite solar cells with high
PCE usually contain the toxic lead and the poor stability, which seriously
restricts their commercial applications. The development of stable
lead-free hybrid perovskites is still a big challenge to obtain high
photovoltaic performance.

With regard to the all-inorganic lead
perovskite CsPbX3, CsPbI3 is the best candidate
because of the improved
stability and suitable band gap (1.73 eV).7 However, α-CsPbI3 is unstable below 634 K, and
it can easily transform to a yellow nonperovskite δ-phase under
room temperature.8 A theoretical study
showed that a two-dimensional layered Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite
Cs2PbI4 may not be a good material for photovoltaic
applications owing to its low carrier mobility and poor optical absorption.9 CsPbBr3 was shown to have good charge
transport properties,10 and it has significant
potential in ferroelectric applications.11 Moreover, the Mos2/CsPbBr3 heterostructure
can effectively retain some of the excellent properties of individual
MoS2 and CsPbBr3.12

A series of Ge-based halide perovskites have been synthesized,
and the theoretical results indicate that Ge is a suitable substitution
to replace the toxic Pb.13 MAPb0.25 Ge0.75I3 can become a promising candidate
for perovskite solar cells because of the proper band gap, lower effective
masses, and better optical absorption.14 The photovoltaic performance of the mixed halide perovskite MAGeI3–xClx was
investigated, and the transport and optical properties can be improved
by increasing the concentration of I.15 The geometrical, electronic, and optical properties of the mixed
metal perovskite RbGe1–xSnxI3 were systematically studied.16 The results found that RbGe0.50Sn0.50I3 has superior transport and optical properties.16

Some investigations have been carried
out to explore alternative
lead-based hybrid perovskites, involving analogous Sn-based perovskites.17−19 Sn is an ideal candidate element to replace lead, which is located
in the same periodic table. Moreover, they have similar ionic radius.
However, the Sn2+ ion is highly unstable and can be easily
oxidized to Sn4+,17 which leads
to a great reduction in photovoltaic performance. The PCE of Sn-based
perovskite solar cells is reported to be about 6%.17−19 Recently, the
use of mixed MAPb1–xSnxI3 perovskites for photovoltaic applications
has been reported by experimental and theoretical works.20−25 The results have revealed that partial replacement of Pb with Sn
can reduce the band gap, extending the absorption spectra toward the
midinfrared region of the solar spectrum.20 The higher PCE of 9.8% has been reported for such perovskite materials,
which leads to the consideration of their application to reduce the
use of toxic Pb in perovskite solar cell devices.25

In light of the potential applications of mixed Sn–Pb
hybrid
perovskites in replacing lead-based materials, it is valuable to explore
good stability and lead-less perovskite materials and to improve the
photovoltaic performance. In this work, we employed first-principles
calculations to investigate the electronic and optical properties
of mixed-cation mixed-metal halide perovskites. The choice of mixed
Pb–Sn perovskites is motivated by the fact that these materials
have broader optical absorption in the visible light region. Moreover,
the amount of toxic Pb would be greatly reduced in these materials.
Interestingly, our calculated results indicate that the band gaps
of the mixed perovskites are slightly decreased by doping the Cs cation.
The optical absorption can be further enhanced in the long-wavelength
region of 600–1000 nm. In addition, these mixed perovskite
materials possess better structural stability.

Results and Discussion
Geometry optimization of MA1–xCsxPb0.25Sn0.75I3 compounds has been carried out using the MAPbI3 tetragonal I4/mcm experimental
cell parameters.18 The optimized structures
of the MA1–xCsxPb0.25Sn0.75I3 series are
shown in Figure 1.
The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is usually used
to evaluate the crystallographic stability of perovskites. The formula
is as follows26 1  where RA, RB, and RX are effective
ionic radii for A, B, and X, respectively. The value of the tolerance
factor t should be in the range of 0.81–1.11.27 Our calculated t values are
variable from 0.84 to 0.87. These results preliminarily show that
these mixed halide perovskites are stable.

To further examine the effect of Cs substitution, we have evaluated
the formation energy of the mixed halide perovskites according to
the following equation 2  where E(MA1–xCsxPb0.25Sn0.75I3), E(MAI), E(CsI), E(PbI2), and E(SnI2) are the energy of MA1–xCsxPb0.25Sn0.75I3, MAI, CsI, PbI2, and SnI2, respectively. x is the ratio of Cs+ doping, and we adopted
the x value of 0, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, respectively.
Our calculated (ΔH) value for MAPbI3 is 0.01 eV/f.u., which is well consistent with the previous theoretical
values of −0.0128 and −0.02
eV/f.u.29 The results indicate that MAPbI3 is marginally stable and it can decompose to MAI and PbI2 under ambient condition. The calculated formation energies
of the predicted perovskites are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that all of our predicted
mixed perovskites are highly stable.

Figure 2 Calculated formation energies of MA1–xCsxPb0.25Sn0.75I3.

As a photovoltaic material for solar cells, the band gap is crucial
to the optical absorption in the visible light region. We have calculated
the band structure to explore the electronic properties of predicted
perovskites by using the optB86b-vdW and HSE06 functionals. The band
gaps of perovskites calculated by the two functionals are shown in Figure 3. The band gap value
of MAPb0.25Sn0.75I3 with the optB86b-vdW
functional is 0.71 eV, which is much lower than its experimental value.
The band gap value of MAPb0.25Sn0.75I3 with the HSE06 functional is 1.24 eV, which matches well with the
previous theoretical value of 1.20 eV23 and reaches the experimental values of 1.2321 and 1.17 eV.20 The results of two methods
demonstrate clearly the same tendency that the values of band gaps
slightly decrease when the proportion of Cs+ increases.
The band gaps of mixed-cation halide perovskites are in the range
of 1.0–1.3 eV. Moreover, both the valence band maximum (VBM)
and conduction band minimum (CBM) of these perovskite materials are
located at the same high symmetry point in the Brillouin region from
optB86b-vdW calculations, indicating that these materials exhibit
a direct band gap feature. MA1–xCsxPb0.25Sn0.75I3 with ideal band gaps in the visible absorption region
can be potential candidates of lead-less photovoltaic materials.

Figure 3 Calculated
band gap trends with different methods of MA1–xCsxPb0.25Sn0.75I3 with the experimental value.

It is important to explore the intrinsic reason for the variation
of band gaps in halide perovskites. The band gaps of halide perovskites
are mainly affected by structural distortion, and the key factor is
the Pb–I–Pb bond angle.30 The B–I–B (B = Pb or Sn) bond angles of these mixed
perovskites are listed in Table 1. The larger distortion of the B–I–B
bond angles is from the ab plane. For MAPb0.25Sn0.75I3 and MA0.75Cs0.25Pb0.25Sn0.75I3, the ab plane distortion may play an important role in tuning the band gap
compared with MAPbI3. However, both the ab plane and the c-axis distortion should be crucial
to tune the band gap for MA0.50Cs0.50Pb0.25Sn0.75I3 and MA0.25Cs0.75Pb0.25Sn0.75I3.

Figure 4 illustrates
the density of states (DOS) and projected DOS for these mixed perovskites,
calculated by the HSE06 functional. The results show that the compositions
of DOS for the four materials are very similar. The VBM is mainly
constituted by I-5p orbitals, while the CBM is mainly constituted
by Sn-5p orbitals. The Cs/MA cations cannot affect the electronic
states because they are far from the band edges.

functional.

The optical absorption is important
to photovoltaic material in
applications. The optical spectra of these mixed perovskites can be
calculated through the complex dielectric function by the following
equation31 3  Here, ε1 and ε2 are the real and imaginary parts
of dielectric function,
respectively, and ω represents the frequency of light. The absorption
coefficient I(ω) was given below32 4  

We used the optB86b-vdw
functional along with the scissor correction
in band gap calculation to gain as accurate as that of the HSE06 functional.
The band gap is usually underestimated in Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) calculations and overestimated for the dielectric properties.
Based on the scissor correction, we compare the optical absorption
of Cs-doped MAPb0.25Sn0.75I3 with
that of the pure structure MAPbI3, as shown in Figure 5a. When the wavelength
is located in the range of 200–300 nm, the optical absorption
of the studied perovskite materials is stronger than that of MAPbI3, and the optical absorption coefficient can reach over 10–6 cm–1. Moreover, their light absorption
is also considerable in the long-wavelength region between 600 and
1000 nm, as shown in Figure 5b. These mixed perovskites exhibit good structural stability,
strong optical absorption in the visible light region, and the decrement
of toxic Pb. Therefore, MA1–xCsxPb0.25Sn0.75I3 has the potential to become the absorbing layer of perovskite solar
cells.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
systematically studied the structural stability,
electronic structures, and optical properties of MA1–xCsxPb0.25Sn0.75I3 by employing the first-principles calculations
to reveal their photovoltaic applications for the first time. These
four compounds are direct band gap semiconductors and have good structural
stability. The band gap values of these materials are in the range
of 1.0–1.3 eV, which are suitable for photovoltaic devices.
It should be noted that these compounds show excellent optical absorption
coefficients in the visible light region. The above-mentioned performances
clearly show that mixed-cation mixed-metal perovskite materials can
serve as potential candidates for perovskite solar cells. Our calculations
can provide theoretical guidance for the development of novel lead-less
and stable perovskites for photovoltaic applications.

Computational
Methods
The structural optimization and electronic properties
of perovskite
materials were calculated using density function theory as implemented
in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.33 The interaction between electron and ion was described by the projector-augmented
wave method,34 while the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) of the PBE functional was used to describe the
electron exchange correlation.35 The kinetic
energy cutoff was 550 eV. The energy and force convergence criteria
were set to be 10–5 eV and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively.
The Monkhorst–Pack k points used in the structural
optimization and electronic properties were 6 × 6 × 6 and
8 × 8 × 8, respectively. The optB86b-vdW functional was
applied to account for dispersion interactions in all calculations.36 It is well known that GGA–PBE usually
underestimates the band gaps of halide perovskites. In order to obtain
more accurate band gaps, we used Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
(HSE06) hybrid functional calculations.37 The precise Hartree–Fock exchange contribution for the hybrid
functional was set to 30% in order to repeat the experimental value.
