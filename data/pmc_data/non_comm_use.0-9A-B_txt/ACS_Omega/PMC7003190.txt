Owing to the properties of low density,
large surface areas, excellent
loading capacity, high permeability, and interstitial hollow spaces,
hollow nanostructures have been widely applied in many important research
fields, such as catalysis, drug-controlled release, confined synthesis,
optics and electronics, and energy storage. This work provided a simple
platform for hollow Cu2O nanostructure synthesis based
on the surfactant controlling methodology, which is under the supposed
mechanism of ion-pairing behavior at the initial nucleation stage.
Thus here, we explore our system in two different directions: (1)
we get different types of hollow Cu2O nanoparticles by
controlling the surfactant concentration during the synthesis step
in colloids, which is critical to the novel structure design and potential
application in many different areas and (2) we explore the method
to Cu2O hollow particle synthesis to test the hypothesis
of the ion-pairing behavior during the initial nucleation by tuning
the solvent ratio, cation concentration (such as NH4NO3 addition amount difference in the synthetic step), and selective
etching. By tuning the synthetic conditions as well as designing control
experiments, we hope to provide a solid understanding of the crystal
growth mechanism. Our improved understanding in similar systems (both
Cu2O and ZnO systems) will make it easier for interpreting
nanostructure formation in new discoveries and, more importantly,
in rationally designing various complex nanostructures based on a
bottom-up strategy.

Introduction
Hollowing behavior
is important to nanomaterial application because
it could improve the surface area, porosity, and volume of nanomaterials.1 People studied the hollowing behavior of nanomaterials
for decades to control it better. Hollow nanostructures show great
potential advantages in applications, such as catalysts, batteries,
and solar cells, because of their large surface area and large volume.2 Especially, the hollow oxide nanomaterials, such
as silica, Ti2O, Cu2O, and ZnO, have been used
in many different areas because of their unique physical and chemical
properties.3 More and more studies are
focused on the hollowing behavior of oxide nanostructures in order
to synthesize efficient materials for applications. For example, the
electrode materials, depending on their
structure, morphology, particle size, and guest ions, may display
pseudocapacitive or battery-like behavior whose porosity and diffusion-controlled
processes are critically important to the real application.4

There are normally three main mechanisms
for the oxide hollowing
behavior: surface-selective etching under protection,5 Ostwald ripening,5 and surface
redeposition.6,7 For example, Yin’s group
has reported that poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) can protect the outmost
silica layer from etching while PVP is absorbed on the silica nanoparticle
surface.5 It cannot protect the inner layer
because the PVP molecule size is larger than the silica pore size
to diffuse inside.8,9

In our previous work, we
synthesized the sol–gel silica
nanoparticles and analyzed the silica composition via elemental analysis
and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, and we found that
certain amounts of N and C are trapped within the silica nanoparticles,
which shall be from the incorporation of ammonia cations and unhydrolyzed
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and solvent isopropanol. The ion-pairing
mechanism was introduced to explain the phenomenon. NH3 not only catalyzed the hydrolysis of TEOS but also functionalized
as a deprotonating agent to facilitate the formation of ion pairs
with silicate species, which has a great influence on the formation
and dissolution of silica nanoparticles. The ion-paired silica species
with a longer chain length will preferentially precipitate out in
nonpolar solution (alcohol) and form aggregates. These silica aggregates
can function as the seeds for further growth of silica species with
a short chain length in the monomer addition mode. When they are transferred
to an aqueous solution for etching, the inner part of silica can dissociate
into soluble species, while the outer layer is cross-linked and not
etchable, which eventually leads to the formation of hollow silica
nanoparticles.10

Here, we report
a method to synthesize hollow oxide nanostructures
by using PVP as a surfactant/ligand. The porosity as well as the morphology
of the nanostructures could be controlled by tuning the PVP concentration,
solvent ratio, and growth solution environment. These parameters are
critical to the synthetic control, which could give novel nanostructures
showing unique physical properties, such as high porosity, large surface
area, various morphologies, and so on.

Results and Discussion
First, Cu2O nanoparticles were synthesized in colloids.
Typically, DI water containing PVP (different concentrations of 0–12
mg/mL) aqueous solution was added to a 20 mL glass vial heated at
60 °C by using an oil bath to dissolve PVP to give a homogeneous
clear solution. Then, CuCl2 aqueous solution and NaOH aqueous
solution were added in sequence under vigorous stirring to mix the
solutions quickly. The NaOH solution was added to tune the pH of the
solution. Finally, a hydrazine hydrate solution (reducing agent) was
added by dropping (droplet addition) with vigorous stirring. To study
the hollowing mechanism in the ion-pairing hypothesis, different parameters
were changed in the synthesis step, such as the ligand/surfactant
concentration, salt concentration, and solvent ratio.10−12 All the nanocrystals have been characterized by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and XRD to confirm
the structure here.

For the Cu2O nanocube synthesis,
we find that the surfactant
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) concentration is critical to the final
morphologies. A PVP concentration increase from 0 to 12 mg/mL could
lead to surfactant micelles and different adsorption on the primary
nucleation seed surface, which might be embedded inside the crystal.13,14 As shown in Figure 1, hollow Cu2O nanocubes were collected at a high concentration
of PVP solution during the synthesis. The Cu2O nanocubes
synthesized at a lower PVP concentration or without any PVP addition
show a high density with a regular cubic shape. However, the nanoparticle
morphology changed with PVP addition, especially the void that appeared
in the center of the nanoparticles (Figure 1a–f). Also, the cubic shape changed
from a cubic morphology to a not regular cubic one. Here, it is clear
that the PVP and copper ions form a kind of cluster/template at the
initial stage of the crystal nucleation, which is similar to the ionic
polymer (polyelectrolyte) behavior.14 With
knowledge of ionic polymers, the stability of the polymers in a solution
is highly related with the concentration of counterions and solvent
polarity in the growth solution. The counterionized polymers could
be precipitated out under a nonpolar or lower polar environment and
trap more organic molecules (or oligomers) to give hollow/porous nanostructures.
Especially, when the surfactant concentration is very high (higher
than 8 mg/mL), the nanocube would be heavily hollowed. The HRTEM data
in Figure 2 show that
it is a mesocrystal-like crystal. Here, this kind of control has never
been reported for the Cu2O nanocube synthesis. As it has
been reported that PVP could be used as a template to synthesize some
porous/hollow nanoparticles,15 systematically
studying the PVP concentration effects on porous morphology has never
been done (PVP–copper clusters showing polyelectrolyte-like
properties). Also, this unique understanding demonstrates a series
of control experiments to test the ion-pairing hypothesis, such as
the addition of counterions in the synthesis, change of the solvent
polarity, and using different types of surfactants in the synthesis.

synthesized at different surfactant PVP concentrations of (a) 2, (b)
4, (c) 6, (d) 8, (e) 10, and (f) 12 mg/mL. Heavier hollowing at higher
PVP concentration is clear.

of the sample in panel a showing the porous property of the nanoparticle

a. (f) EDX color maps of the Cu2O hollow crystal shown
in Figure 1f.

As shown in Figure 2a,b, the clear (111) and (110) lattice fringes of Cu2O
nanocrystals can be observed, and the XRD spectrum in Figure 2e also confirms the presentation
of the nanocrystal phase. Interestingly, the EDX maps shown in Figure 2f (also, see the Supporting Information) clearly present the hollow
morphology of the cube synthesized in the presence of PVP aqueous
solution, identifying the successful synthetic control of hollow/porous
metal nanocrystals in colloids. In order to clarify the porous nanoparticle
formation, we conducted a EDX line scan to the final hollow nanoparticles,
as shown in Figure S5 where Cu distribution
shows the trajectory of the porous morphology, while carbon distribution
is homogeneous in the whole area, which may be contributed by the
carbon contamination as well as the TEM grid (carbon layer on the
grid).

For the Cu2O nanocube coating another spherical
layer
of Cu2O, we have tried to introduce the salt (NH4NO3) into the synthesis, which will help us to know whether
the counterions can affect the oxide formation and hollowing, just
like how it happens in the silica nanoparticle formation process.
As the hypothesis shows above, the presence of ion pairs plays a very
important role in pore formation and cube morphology, which is attributed
to surface crystallization dynamic difference caused by polyelectrolyte-like
cluster formation. Therefore, by changing the nature of ion pairs,
we may further tune the solubility of cluster-like species in the
primary nucleation stage. Intentionally, we added certain amounts
of salts like NH4NO3 under the synthetic condition.
Because the NH4+ ions can be counterionized
with negatively charged PVP–copper polyelectrolyte-like clusters,
they immediately aggregated to form oligomers. These are more likely
to aggregate due to a lower solubility and fast deposition kinetics
in different polar solvents, as shown in Figures 3 and 6a.

Figure 3 TEM images showing the purified products of Cu2O nanocubes@Cu2O spherical shell at different salt (NH4NO3) concentrations of (a) 0, (b) 2, (c) 4, and (d) 8 mM. It
is clear that a higher salt concentration gives a heavier hollowing
of core–shell nanoparticles.

According to Figure 3, it is clear to see that the spherical Cu2O shell morphologies
are different at different salt (NH4NO3) concentrations.
Typically, the core–shell nanoparticle was the final product
without any NH4NO3 addition; it will be lightly
hollowed at the interface of the nanocube core and the spherical shell
when the salt (NH4NO3) concentration is 2 mM;
the heavily hollowed shell would be observed when the salt (NH4NO3) concentration is increased to 8 mM or higher.
The trend between the salt (NH4NO3) concentration
and the spherical shell morphology is clearly seen there.15,16 We think it is possible that ion doping caused by the ion concentration
difference might affect the shell morphology.17−19 Previously,
van Blaaderen and Kentgens investigated the structure of the siloxane
network in silica particles by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
which revealed the existence of a small amount of clusters (oligomers)
due to incomplete hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS. Similarly,
PVP–Cu ion groups not only change the homogeneity in the internal
structure of oxide particles but also affect the external morphology,
as shown in this work.20,21

From a polyelectrolyte
(or ionic polymer) point of view, the stability
of the polymers/clusters in solution is highly related to the counterion
concentration and solvent polarity. Based on its physical property,
the solvent polarity can also have a great influence on the ion-pairing
kinetics and also the surface nucleation. Since the solvent is a mixture
of water and ethanol, different ratios between the two can give a
different polarity, which shall lead to different deposition kinetics
of Cu2O nanoparticles.

The solvent ratio control
experiments (Figure 4) of the nanostructure formation during the
synthetic step show the trend clearly: at higher water content (EtOH/water
= 1:4), the main product is the dense nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 4a. However, with
an ethanol concentration increase in the solvent mixture, there would
be heavier porous nanoparticle formation, as shown in Figure 4b,c. The trend of nanoparticle
shell thickness (as well as size) change with the solvent ratio (ethanol/water
volume ratio) change is shown in Figure 4d, which could tell the solvent polarity
effect clearly. Theoretically, the higher the solvent polarity is,
the easier the PVP–Cu ionic polymer to precipitate out. As
for cluster species like monomers, dimers, or trimers, they will deposit
on the precipitates in a manner that is quite different from the traditional
crystallization (also called the polymer-trapped process, as shown
in Figure 6a). This
explains both the void/pore formation in the center of the nanoparticle
and the cube-to-sphere overall nanoparticle morphology change.

Figure 4 TEM images
showing the purified products of Cu2O nanocubes@Cu2O spherical shell at different solvent volume ratios of EtOH/water:
(a) 1:4, (b) 1:1, and (c) 4:1. (d) Shell thickness of Cu2O nanoparticles at different solvent ratios. It is clear that lower
polarity of the mixing solvent leads to heavier hollowing while giving
a thinner shell for the Cu2O nanocubes@Cu2O
spherical nanoparticle.

Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) data shown in Figure 5 also support our
hypothesis. For the Cu2O nanoparticles synthesized at a
lower salt (NH4NO3) concentration, the BET data
show that it has a smaller surface area (68.74 cc/g); for the Cu2O nanoparticles synthesized at a higher salt (NH4NO3) concentration, the BET data show that it has a large
surface area (83.15 cc/g). The result means that at a higher salt
concentration, the Cu2O nanoparticle porosity would be
higher compared to that at the lower salt concentration. It can be
explained under the ion doping mechanism, which means that a higher
salt concentration might lead to a heavier ion doping inside the Cu2O nanoparticles by quick precipitation, which would trap more
counterions inside. Then, there would be more defects inside the Cu2O nanoparticles leading to high porosity. However, the PVP–Cu
clusters have more condensation time to grow into higher cross-linking
clusters with higher crystallization, which in turn gives crystals
with lower or no defect, showing a perfect cubic morphology and a
dense solid domain without visible voids inside.

purified products of Cu2O nanocubes@Cu2O spherical
nanoparticle at different salt (NH4NO3) concentrations
of (a) 0 and (b) 4 mM. Corresponding

surface areas of the two samples: (c) 0 and (d) 4 mM.

To understand the scenario of copper oxide morphology evolution
at different stages, a key observable trend should be the shape transformation
gallery, as shown in Figure 6a,b. As a common sense for polyelectrolytes,
the solubility of the ion-paired polymer-like species should depend
on the solvent polarity, positively charged ion concentration, and
the primary cluster chain length, which are also variable at the different
stages of Cu2O nanocrystal formation. Considering the higher
concentration of precursor at the initial stage, it is expected that
a large size polymer chain would form. They would preferentially nucleate
due to their low solubility, wrapping in with them a large number
of counterions as well as PVP molecules. In contrast, the outer layer
was built up from the subsequent addition of the leftover monomers
and short-length polymers. These shorter polyelectrolytes retain less
counterions and eventually give more cross-linked shells by crystallization.
Hence, the dramatic difference between the two stages leads to an
abrupt boundary of different deposition dynamics, which could give
a hollow/porous structure after the addition of a high concentration
PVP (cluster size is larger), higher positively charged ion concentration
(concentrated ion-pairing formation), or higher ethanol/water ratio
(lower polarity solvent leads to fast cluster precipitation with rich
defects). We also characterize the intermediates of the crystal formation
process, as shown in Figure 6b, by trapping the intermediates. It is clear to see that
there are polymer-like species at the initial stage of nucleation
(5 min after the reducing agent addition), which is an amorphous-like
material (with the presence of the PVP). This trend supports our hypothesis
of ion-paired polymer-like formation.

Figure 6 (a) Schematics illustrating the significant
role of ion pairing
in the formation of hollow Cu2O nanoparticles. (b) TEM
images showing the primary nucleation–crystallization-selective
etching steps of the Cu2O crystal.

With the above knowledge, we could enrich the structure map of
Cu2O by adjusting the critical parameters, which could
affect the ion-pairing behavior. Hence, in Figure 7, we summarized the hollow and porous nanoparticle
formation, which is dependent on the experimental environments. With
a higher PVP concentration, as shown in Figure 7a, more polymer-like amorphous material formation
gives hollow-like particles. Similarly, a highly porous particle was
the main product when a high cation concentration is present in the
synthesis solution, as shown in Figure 7b, which could lead to more ion-pairing behavior at
the initial stage of nucleation to trap more noncrystals within the
nanoparticle domain. Finally, the water content (solvent volume ratio
of ethanol/water) also plays an important role in the ion-pairing
process, as shown in Figure 7c; a lower water concentration will lead to more amorphous
polymer-like species formation at the initial stage of nucleation,
which gives a porous-like nanoparticle rather than dense single- or
polycrystalline nanoparticles. All these control experiments support
our hypothesis of ion-pairing behavior during the Cu2O
formation in different solutions. Here, to explore this mechanism
with other metal oxide synthesis, ZnO nanoparticle synthesis was chosen
as another model study. As shown in Figure S6, ZnO hollow nanoparticles were observed when PVP was introduced
in the synthetic step under different concentrations or under different
solvent ratios (Figure S7), which shows
a similar trend with Cu2O synthesis. As a comparison, we
found that the ZnO nanoparticle hollowing behavior also depends on
its ion-pairing behavior. We believe that it is helpful to the hollow
mechanism study although it might be at a different level for different
systems.

Figure 7 Cu2O nanoparticle morphology changes when these nanoparticles
were synthesized under different conditions. TEM images of the Cu2O nanoparticles synthesized under (a) different PVP concentrations
as shown in the chart flow ([PVP] = 2, 6, and 16 mg/mL, respectively),
(b) different NH4NO3 concentrations as shown
in the chart flow ([NH4NO3] = 0, 4, and 8 mM,
respectively), and (c) different water concentrations as shown in
the chart flow (ethanol/water volume ratio = 1/8, 1/1, 8/1, respectively).

Conclusions
In summary, we report
a facile method to prepare hollow/porous
copper oxide nanoparticles by controlling the ion-pairing behavior.
By playing with the surfactant concentration, solvent ratio, and cation
concentration, we achieved different types of hollow/porous nanoparticles,
suggesting a new pathway in nanomaterial design. Our proof of concept
is that the ion-pairing polymer-like behavior in the synthetic approach
can create new morphologies of copper oxides (as well as ZnO), which
is a clear demonstration for the porous/hollow nanoparticle design
as well as its potential applications in catalysts, batteries, sensors,
and so on.22−27

Experimental Section
Materials
Copper chloride (CuCl2, 98%, Aldrich),
hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O,
99.8%, Alfa Aesar), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3, Aldrich), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw of 40,000, Aldrich), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 98%, Aldrich) were
used as received without any further purification. All glassware for
nanoparticle syntheses was treated with aqua regia (a mixture of HCl
and HNO3 with a volume ratio of 3:1), thoroughly rinsed
with water, and dried under N2 gas immediately before use.
Nanopure water (18.2 MΩ·cm at 25 °C) purified using
a Milli-Q Advantage A10 system was used for all washing and solution
preparation.

Synthesis of Cu2O Nanoparticles
(Different PVP Concentrations)
In order to test PVP concentration
effects, the typical synthesis
procedure was as the following that 9.0 mL of pure DI water and 7.7
mL of DI water containing PVP (with different concentration from 0
to 12 mg/mL) were sequentially added into a 20 mL glass vial. The
mixture was heated at 60 °C by using an oil bath. Then, 0.1 mL
of 0.15 M CuCl2 aqueous solution and 0.1 mL of 0.1 M NaOH
aqueous solution were added under vigorous stirring (600 rpm) in that
order. The NaOH solution was added drop by drop under stirring. Finally,
0.15 mL of 0.25 M N2H4 solution (reducing agent)
was added by dropping (droplet addition) with vigorous stirring. The
final mixed solution was aged in an oil bath for another 1 h. The
as-synthesized nanoparticles were purified by centrifugation at 8000
rpm for 8 min three times to remove the impurities.

Synthesis of
Cu2O Nanoparticles (Different Solvent
Ratios)
To the solvent ratio control experiments, 9.0 mL
of ethanol/water mixed solvent (at different volume ratios) was added
at the beginning, instead of using pure water. For the synthesis experiments
under different solvent ratios, every step is the same as above except
the usage of 9 mL of pure water, which was replaced by the mixture
of water and ethanol.

Synthesis of Cu2O Nanoparticles
(Different Ion Concentrations)
To test the positively charged
ion effect on ion-pairing behavior,
ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) was added into the
solution to give a solution with different cation molar concentrations
(0, 2, 4, and 6 mM) at the beginning of the synthesis. Then, 0.1 mL
of 0.10 M CuCl2 aqueous solution and 0.1 mL of 0.1 M NaOH
aqueous solution were added under vigorous stirring (600 rpm), whose
following procedure is the same as above sections.

Characterization
TEM images were collected from a JEM-1400
(JEOL) transmission electron microscopy operated at 100 kV. High-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) images were taken from
a JEOL 2100F field emission transmission electron microscope at 200
kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Bruker D8-Advance
θ–2θ diffractometer in reflectance Bragg–Brentano
geometry employing Ni-filtered Cu Kα line focused radiation
at 1600 W (40 kV, 40 mA) power and equipped with a Na(Tl) scintillation
detector fitted with a 0.2 mm radiation entrance slit. All samples
were ground to ensure monodispersity in the bulk and then mounted
onto a zero-background sample holder by dropping powders from a wide-blade
spatula, and the sample surface was then leveled with a razor blade.
BET surface area and pore size measurements were conducted with N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K on a Micromeritics
ASAP 2020 v3.04 H instrument.
