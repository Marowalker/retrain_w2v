Novel amphiphilic Zn(II)phthalocyanines
(ZnPcs) peripherally substituted
with four and eight dimethylaminopyridinium units (ZnPc1 and ZnPc2) were synthesized by cyclotetramerization
of the corresponding phthalonitriles. The effect of aggregation and
photophysical (fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes) and photochemical
(singlet oxygen generation and photodegradation under light irradiation)
properties was investigated. The chemosensing ability of ZnPcs toward
explosive nitroaromatic compounds was explored in aqueous medium.
This study demonstrates that ZnPc1 and ZnPc2 show fluorescence quenching behavior upon interaction with different
nitro analytes and show unprecedented selectivity toward 2,4,6-trinitrophenol
with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.7–1.1 ppm with a high
quenching rate constant (Ksv) of 1.6–2.02
× 105. The near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence in thin
films was quenched efficiently because of the photoinduced electron-transfer
process through strong intermolecular π–π and electrostatic
interactions. The sensing process is highly reversible and free from
the interference of other commonly encountered nitro analytes. Further,
experiments were performed to demonstrate the use of ZnPcs as efficient
heterogeneous photocatalysts in the reduction of nitro explosives.
The smart dual performance of multicharged ZnPcs in aqueous media
quantifies them as attractive candidates in developing sensor materials
at the NIR region and to possibly convert the toxic explosives into
useful scaffolds. These results provide an interesting perspective
toward elaboration of stable fluorescent systems for the selective
sensing behavior of nitro explosives and their facile heterogeneous
catalytic behavior in the reduction reactions.

Introduction
In recent years, significant
research efforts have been made to
develop chemical sensors for explosive compounds toward security and
environment protection. Long-term disposal of explosives such as nitroaromatic
compounds, related nitrated explosives, and their degraded products
has shown detrimental effects on the human health and also enhanced
the toxic levels of soil and groundwater.1,2 For
example, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) [also known as picric acid (PA)]
was extensively used in the manufacture of rocket fuel, fireworks,
textile industry, and astringent for the medical purpose. TNP and
its biologically transformed products such as picramic acids have
been identified as highly toxic species to biota and lead to chronic
diseases such as sycosis and cancer.3 Different
analytical techniques have been employed for the detection of explosives,
such as ion mobility spectroscopy, neutron activation analysis, chromatography,
infrared spectroscopy, electrochemical detection, surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray imaging.4−9 Most of these methods pose difficulties in the trace detection of
explosives, complicated manipulation, preconcentration prior to the
analysis, and operation difficulty. Currently available detection
devices cannot be assembled in a small and low-power package for field
analysis, thus restricting the popularization toward the recognition
of explosives. Recently, optical methods based on colorimetric and
fluorescence changes have gained much attention because of their high
selectivity and fast detection in both solid and liquid phases and
can be easily incorporated into inexpensive and portable microelectronic
devices. Suslick and Lin have developed an array-based colorimetric
sensor system for triacetone triperoxide and other explosive analytes
with different redox indicators by a color recognition pattern with
a limit of detection (LOD) below 2 ppb.10 Different fluorescent probes such as conjugated polymers, small
fluorescent molecules, quantum dots, metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs), and covalent organic frameworks were used for the detection
of explosives.11−14 The predominant detection mechanism and high sensitivity are endorsed
because of strong π–π interactions, inter/intra molecular
hydrogen bonding, Meisenheimer complex, and electrostatic interactions
between fluorophores and explosive analytes.15−18 Xu et al. have developed an infrared
emission probe DNSA-SQ, which shows turn-on fluorescence upon interaction
with PA by intramolecular charge transfer along with protonation of
the dimethylamine group by PA.19 Ghosh
et al. have developed a porous UiO-68@NH2 MOF containing
pendant Lewis basic amine recognition sites. The obtained MOF show
high selective recognition for TNP in a few seconds with 23 times
high quenching rate than 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and (O2NNCH2)3. The phenolic −OH of TNP undergoes
electrostatic interactions with the −NH2 unit of
MOFs along with the energy-transfer mechanism.20 Bhalla et al. have developed nanoaggregates of supramolecular
assembly of a hexaphenylbenzene derivative modulated with Hg2+ ions, which show remarkable selectivity for TNP because of transfer
of protons of hydroxyl groups to the basic N,N-dimethylamino group to make an electrostatic complex between
host and guest.21 Literature studies in
the field of explosive sensors have allowed the realization of highly
sensitive sensors; however, novel functionalization of amphiphilic
molecular ensembles for selective detection of explosive analytes
in aqueous medium at the near-infrared (NIR) region with high sensitivity
is very limited. Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are a class of high π-conjugated
systems with an intense absorption at the visible and NIR region with
high photostability/thermal stability, which makes them active photosensitizers
in photodynamic therapy.22,23 Because of low solubility
of Pcs in common solvents, their physico-chemical properties are prevented
from being extensively used in technological applications. However,
their solubility can be improved by attaching some functional groups
such as −COOH, −SO3H, −PO3H2, ammonium, long alkyl, alkoxy, phenoxy groups, and
crown ethers at peripheral and nonperipheral positions and/or by inserting
some metal atoms in the inner core of the ring.24−27 Modified metallo phthalocyanines
(MPcs) were exploited toward optical sensors for volatile organic
compounds. MPcs modified with fluoroalkyl substituents and the metal
ion showed an increased sensitivity and selectivity toward TNT by
the quartz crystal microbalance method.28 The high planar nature of Pcs promotes strong interactions with
acceptor molecules by formation of strong π–π stacking
interactions, leading to dramatic changes in the Q-band absorption
and emission properties. Introduction of a varied number of amine
functionalities on Zn(II)phthalocyanines (ZnPcs) shows selective sensing
behavior of TNP, which arises because of increase in the donating
strength on ZnPcs for efficient π–π stacking with
TNP in chloroform and vapor-phase methods.29 However, the aqueous phase detection of TNP becomes an imperative
aspect for the design of potential sensors because of its high water
solubility (∼14 g/L at 20 °C) and low octanol–water
partition coefficient (log Kow = 1.6).30 To the best of our knowledge, the design of
explosive chemical sensors in aqueous medium at the NIR region is
very limited. The fluorescent sensors at the NIR region has significant
advantages over the visible region because of lower photo damage and
reduced light scattering and can effectively avoid background interference
to enhance the selectivity and sensitivity. In this work, we describe
a facile synthesis of novel amphiphilic Zn(II)Pcs with varied number
of dimethylaminopyridinium (DMAP) units at peripheral positions. Nucleophilic
substitution of DMAP units on Zn(II)Pcs imparts positive charge on
the macromolecule to enhance the solubility in aqueous medium and
extended conjugation by strongly influencing the photophysical properties
at the near NIR region. The compounds show high photostability and
could be able to generate high singlet oxygen (1O2). The chemosensing ability of ZnPcs with different explosive nitroaromatic
compounds (NACs) is demonstrated in aqueous and vapor-phase methods.
ZnPc2 shows unprecedented selectivity toward TNP and
shows turn-off fluorescence by efficient π–π interactions
and intramolecular charge processes by protonating the dimethylamine
group. Moreover, the utility of ZnPc2 as a photocatalyst
in the reduction of TNP is demonstrated with an emphasis of dual behavior
of the molecular ensemble for the selective sensing behavior of nitro
explosives which are converted into useful building blocks to develop
macromolecules.

Results and Discussion
The detailed
synthetic methodology adopted for the preparation
of water-soluble ZnPc derivatives with four and eight units of 4-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP) (ZnPc1–2) is described in Scheme 1. Precursor mono- and disubstituted
dimethylaminopyridinium phthalonitriles (1 and 2) were obtained by
the nucleophilic substitution of DMAP with corresponding halogenated
phthalonitriles in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) at 80 °C
under N2 atmosphere for 12 h. The formation of the precipitate
was observed during the reaction, which indicates the nucleophilic
substitution of the DMAP unit on phthalonitriles.32 The cyclotetramerization of 4-dimethylaminopyridinium phthalonitriles
was carried out in 2-dimethylaminoethanol at 120 °C in the presence
of anhydrous ZnCl2 and catalytic amount of DBU under N2 atmosphere. The reaction mixture was precipitated by adding
acetone and methanol solvent mixtures. The peripheral 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine-substituted
ZnPcs1–2 were obtained in good yields (58–63%),
which exhibit good solubility in water. A detailed synthetic procedure
is described in the Supporting Information. ZnPc1 was obtained in a mixture of four possible structural
isomers. The four probable isomers can be designated by their molecular
symmetry as C4h, C2v, Cs, and D2h.33 The structure of the final target
compounds was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR), and mass analysis. The 1H NMR
spectrum of phthalonitrile, 1, shows a singlet peak of
−N(CH3)2 at δ 3.21 ppm and two
doublet peaks of DMAP at δ 8.03 (Py-o-H) and
8.01 (Py-m-H). Phthalonitrile, 2, shows
two doublet peaks at δ 8.38 (Py-o-H) and 7.21
(Py-m-H) corresponding to the aromatic region of
DMAP and a singlet peak at δ 3.27 corresponds to −N(CH3)2. The electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(MS) spectra show the molecular ion peaks at 249.1 and 370.2 [M+], corroborating the proposed structure of phthalonitriles.
The 1H NMR spectrum of ZnPc1 in DMSO-d6 shows four different multiplets corresponding
to four different isomers. The pyridyl protons of Py-o-H, Py-m-H, and Pc-H (α and β) appear
as broad multiplets at δ 8.24–8.18, 7.95–7.86,
7.58–7.44, and 6.97–6.92 ppm and of −N(CH3)3 groups appear as a singlet peak at δ 3.17
ppm. Because of the symmetrical nature of ZnPc2, the
aromatic protons of pyridinium groups appear as doublets at δ
8.27 (Py-o-H) and 7.03 ppm (Py-m-H). The proton signals of Pc-α-H appear as broad peaks at
δ 8.75 and 7.36 ppm and of −N(CH3)3 groups appear at δ 3.23 ppm. The high-resolution MS spectra
of ZnPc1 and ZnPc2 show molecular ion peaks
at 268.10730 and 265.10732, respectively, corresponding to [M + 1]4+ and [M – (DMAP)4]4+, corroborating
in tandem the structural features of the desired compounds (Figures
S1–S10, Supporting Information).

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route for the Preparation of DMAP-Appended ZnPcs
The FT-IR spectra of phthalonitriles
show a −C≡N
stretching band at ca. 2248–2236 cm–1, which
disappeared in the macrocycle, indicating the complete conversion
of phthalonitriles into ZnPcs. For ZnPc1 and ZnPc2, the characteristic macrocycle torsional and wagging vibrations
of C–H groups appear at ca. 2924–2930 cm–1, and C=C modes appear at 1649 cm–1. The
absorption of variant C=N in the phthalocyanine ring observed
at 1572 cm–1 and C–C isoindole ring stretching
vibrations are in the range of ca. 1394–1341 cm–1 (Figure S11, Supporting Information).
The UV–visible absorption spectra of Zn(II)Pcs exhibited characteristic
absorptions in the Q-band region at 680–710 nm, which are attributed
due to π → π* transitions from the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) of the complexes. The B-band appeared at 300–360 nm,
which arises from the deeper π → π* transition
of HOMO (a1u and a2u) to LUMO (eg). Both ZnPc1 and ZnPc2 are well soluble
in water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and DMF and partially soluble
in ethanol. Figure 1a shows the absorption spectra of ZnPcs1–2 in
water and DMSO solutions. ZnPc1 shows an intense absorption
band at 678 nm along with another band at 609 nm. ZnPc2 shows Q-band absorption at 683 nm along with a broad shoulder peak
at 616 nm, indicating that compounds are exhibited in monomeric form
in water.34 In DMSO, the Q-bands were broadened
and slightly red-shifted. ZnPc2 exhibits an ∼20
nm red shift in comparison to ZnPc1. On the other hand,
ZnPcs1–2 show B-band absorption at ca. 345–362
nm with variations in the absorption coefficient. The absorption peak
at 281–291 nm is in correlation to the absorption of DAMP because
of transitions from the deeper π-levels.

of ZnPcs in different solvents. (b) Emission
spectra of ZnPcs upon excitation at λex = 630 nm.

Fluorescence emission spectra
of ZnPcs were recorded in DMSO and
water upon excitation at λex = 630 nm (Figure 1b). The emission spectrum of
ZnPc1 shows emission maxima at 684 nm, and ZnPc2 shows a red-shifted emission at ca. 15 nm in comparison
to ZnPc1, which reveals that increase in the number of
DMAP units on ZnPc increases its conjugation and furnishes a bathochromic
shift in the absorption and emission spectra. In DMSO, the emission
intensity is broadened and shows emission maxima at 693 and 696 nm
for ZnPc1 and ZnPc2, respectively. The fluorescence
lifetime of ZnPc1 and ZnPc2 exhibits 2.890
± 0.03 and 2.78 ± 0.02 ns, respectively, using the time-correlated
single-photon counting (TCSPC) method (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Quantum yields (Φf) of the ZnPc derivatives were measured in the DMSO solution with
reference to ZnPc. The quantum yields were found to be 0.11 and 0.16
for ZnPc1 and ZnPc2, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the photophysical
data of ZnPcs in DMSO.

The aggregation behavior of ZnPcs
was studied in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and DMSO as a function of the concentration, and changes
in B- and Q-band absorbance were monitored. Figure S13a (Supporting Information) shows the absorption
spectra of ZnPcs in DMSO at different concentrations (2–20
μM). A linear increase was observed in the intensity of B-band
and Q-band at 299, 360, and 681 nm for ZnPc1. Interestingly,
ZnPc2 shows a new broad peak at 759 nm. The intensity
of peak gradually increased with an increase in the concentration
of ZnPc2, revealing the formation of J-aggregates. The
intensity of both B- and Q-bands at 281, 359, and 701 nm increased
linearly. The inset shows the change in the Q-band intensity for different
concentrations. For both compounds, the Q-band absorbance increases
linearly by following Beer–Lambert’s law with the rate
constants of 3.7 × 104 and 3.8 × 104. Under similar concentration ranges, these compounds showed a decrease
in the Q-band intensities in the PBS solution, and the intensity of
both B- and Q-bands followed a linear relation with the concentration
(Figure S13b, Supporting Information).

The singlet oxygen generation (1O2) was studied
by the chemical method using 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as a
singlet oxygen scavenger. Change in the absorbance of DPBF was monitored
upon irradiation of light in both the presence and absence of ZnPcs.
During photolysis, we have not observed any significant changes in
the Q-band intensities, confirming that ZnPcs do not undergo photodegradation
during singlet oxygen formation and are quite stable under light irradiation.

The assays of stability and photostability of ZnPc1 and ZnPc2 upon irradiation with white and red lights
(150 mW cm–2) were carried out, and the results
are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Both the compounds were able to produce 1O2, and the photosensitizing ability was found to be higher for ZnPc1 than for ZnPc2. ZnPc1 shows 89%
decrease in the DPBF absorbance over a total irradiation period of
25 min (Figure 2).
The variation in 1O2 is due to the formation
of aggregates in ZnPc2. Since, the aggregation lowers
the photo activity of molecules through dissipation of energy by aggregates
in the excited state furnishes decrease in the formation of 1O2.34

Figure 2 Time-dependent decomposition
of DPBF (50 μM) photosensitized
by ZnPcs in DMF/H2O (9:1) upon irradiation with white light,
filtered through a cutoff filter for λ < 540 nm at an irradiance
of 9.0 mW cm–2 with (tests) or without (control)
ZnPcs (0.5 μM). Values correspond to the average of three independent
experiments.

The electrochemical properties
of ZnPcs were investigated by cyclic
voltammetry with Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode (Figure 3). ZnPcs show reduction
onset potential with quasi-reversibility of two one electron-transfer
processes: one in the region of ca. −0.57 to −0.97 V
and the other in the region of ca. −1.18 to −1.08 V.
The onset reduction E1/2 values with respect
to NHE are found to be −0.94 and −1.16 V for ZnPc1 and −0.64 and −1.11 V for ZnPc2, respectively. The reduction potential of ZnPc2 is
less negative than that of ZnPc1, indicating that LUMO
levels are significantly decreased by the increase in the number of
DMAP units on ZnPcs, which facilitates more favorable electron-transfer
process with acceptor molecules.

Figure 3 Cyclic voltammogram of ZnPcs (0.250 mM)
in water.

To obtain a deeper insight into
understanding the electronic structures
and the energy levels of ZnPcs, density function theory (DFT) calculations
were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31g* basis set using Gaussian 16 package.35 From the optimized geometry, the HOMO electron
density is mainly localized on the macrocycle backbone and the LUMO
electron density is distributed on the DMAP units present at the periphery.
The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels are found to be −1.76
and −1.17 eV for ZnPc1 and −0.91 and −0.49
eV for ZnPc2, respectively. The obtained energy levels
from DFT studies are consistent with the electrochemical data. For
ZnPc2, the LUMO energy levels decreased dramatically,
leading to a decrease in the HOMO–LUMO gap (0.48 eV) and favoring
easy transfer of electrons from ZnPcs to the acceptor molecule (Figure
S14, Supporting Information).

The
rich π-electronic nature and emission of ZnPcs in the
red region, energy levels, and good solubility in aqueous medium provoke
us to explore their potential application as fluorescent chemosensors
at the NIR region. To study the interaction between nitro explosives
and ZnPcs, fluorescence titration experiments were performed by adding
aliquots of various analytes to the aqueous solution of ZnPcs. NACs
are high electron-deficient compounds, which can undergo efficient
π–π and H-bonding interactions, furnishing a differential
change in the emission properties. Different NACs such as nitrobenzene
(NB), 4-nitrotoluene (NT), 4-nitrophenol (NP), 2,4-dinitrotoluene
(DNT), 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), TNT, TNP, and nitromethane (NM) were
treated with ZnPcs. Because of electron-deficient nature of the NACs,
the fluorescence intensity of ZnPcs was readily quenched because of
facile electron transfer between the fluorophore and NACs. However,
the degree of quenching significantly varied with the nature of nitro
analytes. The fluorescence titration experiments were carried out
upon incremental addition of various nitroaromatics (with a concentration
of ∼1 × 10–6 to ∼2 × 10–4 M) to the solution of ZnPcs (∼2 × 10–5 M). Figure 4a,b shows the change in the emission intensity of ZnPc1 and ZnPc2 (in H2O) upon addition
of TNP. For both compounds, we have observed ∼10% decrease
in the emission intensity upon addition of 10 μM solution of
TNP. The emission intensity changed dramatically upon initial addition
and then reached a plateau. Upon addition of 100 μM solution
of TNP, we have observed 87 and 89% decrease in the emission intensity
for ZnPc1 and ZnPc2, respectively. With
further increase in the concentration, we have observed a plateau
with no change in the emission intensity. Figure 4c shows the variation in quenching efficiency
of various NACs toward ZnPcs. This study reveals that ZnPc2 has superior quenching performance (by 1.15 times) toward NACs,
and both compounds show good selectivity toward TNP. As seen from Figure 5c, the emission intensity
of ZnPc2 was quenched by 60% as the concentration of
TNT reached to 100 μM, whereas the quenching efficiencies of
2,4-DNT, 2,4-DNP, 4-NP, 4-NT, and NB are 22, 19, 9, 8, and 5%, respectively.
It is also revealed that increase in the number of nitro groups enhances
the electron deficiency in nitroaromatic molecules and thus the extent
of fluorescence quenching. Additionally, the acidity of the phenolic
group increases with an increase in the number of the nitro group,
furnishing the formation of electrostatic interactions between ZnPcs
and TNP. The trend in the quenching effect of ZnPcs follows the order:
NM < NB < NT < NP < DNT < DNP < TNT < TNP. Figures
S15 and S16 (Supporting Information) show
changes in the emission spectra of ZnPcs treated with different nitro
analytes. Figure S17 (Supporting Information) shows changes in the quenching efficiencies of ZnPcs at different
concentrations of the nitro analytes. The LOD was obtained by measuring
the emission intensities plotted against the concentration of TNP.
The final LOD was measured using the formula LOD = 3.3 × σ/m, where σ is the standard deviation and m is the slope. From the experiments, it was found that the LODs of
TNP were found to be 0.7 ± 0.1 and 1.1 ± 0.1 ppm (Figure
S18, Supporting Information). The LODs
are found to be lower than the standard detection limits of TNP described
by Environmental Protection Agency in water.36

Figure 4 Change
in the emission intensities of ZnPcs upon addition of different
concentrations of TNP (a,b). (c) Change in the quenching efficiency
of ZnPcs upon addition of different nitro analytes.

Figure 5 SV plot of ZnPc1 (a) and ZnPc2 (b) treated
with different nitro analytes.

Further, the quenching behavior of ZnPcs with different nitro
derivatives
was quantitatively analyzed with the Stern–Volmer (SV) equation Io/I = 1 + Ksv[Q], where Io and I represent the fluorescence emission intensity before and
after addition of a quencher, [Q] is the molar concentration of the
quencher, and Ksv is the SV rate constant. Figure 5 shows the SV plot
of ZnPcs with different nitro derivatives. The Io/I value is found to be linearly increased
with increase in the concentration of TNP, indicating that the static
quenching mechanism is more predominant. The quenching of emission
is consistent with the photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) mechanism
for which the electron present in the excited state of ZnPcs is transferred
to the LUMO of the nitro analyte. Because the analyte is nonemissive,
the emission is lost via nonradiative relaxation. Figure S19 (Supporting Information) shows the absorption
and emission spectra of ZnPc2 and TNP. From the spectra,
it is observed that there is no overlap of emission of ZNPc2, and absorption of TNP indicates that the electron-transfer process
is more predominant. Interestingly, for TNP, the SV plot shows a linear
relationship at lower concentrations and exhibits an upward hill at
higher concentrations, indicating that both static quenching and dynamic
quenching exist for TNP. Remarkably, the upward curvature of Io/I values was well fitted
in the Perrin static quenching model ln(Io/I) = Kap[Q], where Kap is the apparent static quenching constant.
This type of static quenching occurs between randomly distributed
fluorophores and quenchers that are in proximity. Fluorophore molecules
in contact with Q at the instant of excitation will not fluoresce.37

The SV rate constants of ZnPcs treated
with different nitro analytes
are summarized in Table S2 (Supporting Information). ZnPc2 exhibits a high quenching rate constant of 2.02 × 105 for TNP and 1.40 × 105 for TNT. Other nitro
derivatives were found to have relatively lower rate constants. ZnPc1 shows 1.6 × 105 for TNP and 5.9 × 104 for TNT. To get more insights into the formation of adducts
between the nitro derivatives and ZnPcs, we have carried out absorption
titration experiments. The absorption spectra of ZnPc2 upon addition of different concentrations of TNP show that the Q-band
intensity increases along with the Soret band by formation of an intercalating
adduct between ZnPc2 and TNP (Figure S20, Supporting Information). As described earlier,
ZnPc2 tends to form aggregates; however, these aggregates
were disrupted by TNP molecules by intercalation and exhibit ZnPc2 in a monomeric form and lead to the formation of adducts.
Because of the presence of regioisomers for ZnPc1 and
existence of monomeric forms, we have observed only decrease in the
Q-band intensity. On the other hand, the Soret band intensity increased
because of overlap in the absorption of Q-band and TNP at 375 nm.

To understand the effect of pH on the sensing behavior, we have
carried out fluorescence titration experiments of ZnPc2 with TNP by adjusting the pH of the solutions using 0.1 M NaOH and
0.1 M HCl.38,39 Under high acidic conditions
(pH ≈ 1–3), we have observed the formation of precipitates
because of aggregation. Hence, titration experiments were performed
from mild acidic to basic medium (pH 5–pH 12). Figure S21 (Supporting Information) shows change in the quenching
behavior upon addition of different concentrations of TNP at pH 5
and pH 12. Upon addition of 2 μM TNP to ZnPc2,
we have obtained the quenching efficiency of 29.4 and 41.8% at pH
5 and pH 12. At higher concentrations of TNP (200 μM), the quenching
efficiencies of 95 and 93% were achieved. The variation in the quenching
efficiencies arises because of different solvent environments. ZnPc2 showed good response at two different pH regions, and the
quenching efficiency is slightly lower than that of the neutral medium.
At pH 5 and lower pH, the emission maxima dramatically decreased because
of protonation of dimethylamine units of DMAP rendering ICT process.
The quenching efficiency was strongly enhanced between pH 5 and pH
12 because the pH of the medium reaches neutral and basic medium because
of formation of efficient electrostatic interactions of adduct formation
between ZnPcs and TNP. Upon addition of TNP to ZnPc2 (5
× 10–5M) at pH-5, electrostatic interactions
associated with the acid medium. Appreciable quenching efficiencies
were achieved in slightly acidic, neutral, and basic media indicative
of effective function as chemosensors in the wide pH ranges.

To further validate the electrostatic interactions between ZnPcs
and TNP, we have performed 1H NMR studies upon addition
of different concentrations of TNP to ZnPc2 (Figure S22, Supporting Information). Upon addition of TNP,
we have observed two significant characteristic features. In the first
step, ZnPc2 undergoes protonation at dimethylamino groups,
which hinders the intramolecular charge transfer from dimethylamino
groups to the macrocycle core and further leads to electrostatic interaction
between the protonated form and the picrate anion. Second, because
of the highly acidic character of the phenolic moiety in TNP, the
pyridinium nitrogen may also get protonated at higher concentrations,
furnishing high fluorescence quenching. The −N(CH3)2 proton signal at δ 3.22 ppm undergoes a downfield
shift of Δδ = 0.06 ppm on addition of TNP, which demonstrates
the protonation of the dimethylamine unit. The doublet peak of meta phenyl ring protons of the DMAP unit at δ 7.095
ppm converted into multiplets with a downfield shift of δ 0.03
ppm, whereas the doublet peak of the ortho phenyl
ring protons at δ 8.289 ppm converted into triplets at 1:0.5
equivalent of TNP. At higher concentrations of TNP, the triplet peaks
further interconverted to multiplets with a downfield shift of δ
0.09 ppm. On the other hand, we have observed a newly generated broad
singlet peak appearing at δ 10.781 ppm equivalent of TNP with
a more downfield shift of δ 11.438 ppm, leading to the protonation
of quaternary pyridinium nitrogen of ZnPc2. The broad
proton signals of ZnPc2-α-H become sharper with
a split in the downfield shift, indicating π–π
stacking interaction between them by formation of the ZnPc2-TNP adduct.

To further understand the role of electrostatic
interactions, a
control experiment was carried out by methylation on ZnPcs using dimethyl
sulfate and treated with different nitro analytes.32 Under similar experimental conditions, the methylated ZnPc2 shows 59% decrease in the emission intensity upon addition
of 100 μM of TNP, which is 30% less than ZnPc2,
as the dimethylamino moiety is no longer available for ICT owing to
its methylation. We have observed a similar behavior for other nitro
compounds treated with ZnPc1.

Figure S23 (Supporting Information)
shows the quenching efficiency of methylated ZnPcs treated with different
nitro compounds. From these results, it is clearly evident that the
picrate anion interacts with the protonated form of N,N′-dimethylamine and pyridinium moieties
through electrostatic interaction along with π–π
interactions, playing a major driving force for the fluorescence quenching
process.40Figure 6 shows the schematic representation of possible
mode of interactions between ZnPc2 and PA.

Figure 6 Schematic illustration
of possible mode of interactions between
ZnPc2 and TNP.

Toward the real-time applications, selective detection of
the analytes
is quite important. Hence, the selectivity of ZnPcs toward the detection
of TNP in water in presence of other nitroanalytes was investigated
by the competitive fluorescence quenching assay. In a typical experiment,
the emission spectrum of ZnPcs was initially recorded. To this solution,
TNT (10 μM) solution was added and allowed to effectively access
interactions with ZnPcs, and the emission spectra were recorded. We
have observed no significant changes in the fluorescence quenching
upon addition of TNT. To this solution, the same quantity of TNP was
added, which resulted in a significant change in the fluorescence
quenching efficiency. The experiment was repeated upon addition of
different concentration cycles of TNT and TNP.

We have observed
that with an increase in the concentration of
TNP, fluorescence quenching significantly decreased. The experiment
was repeated for other nitro analytes with the addition of TNP solutions,
and change in the quenching efficiency is summarized in Figure 7. The stepwise decrease in
the quenching efficiency clearly demonstrates the unprecedented selectivity
of ZnPc2 toward TNP in the presence of other competitive
nitro analytes in aqueous medium. Similar trend in the quenching efficiency
of ZnPc1 was observed in the presence of other competitive
nitro analytes, furnishing its high selectivity toward TNP over all
the congener nitro analytes.

Figure 7 Competitive fluorescence quenching efficiency
of ZnPc2 upon addition of different nitro analytes, followed
by TNP.

For field applicability and real-time
analysis, the sensing behavior
was studied in drinking water and river water samples. Upon addition
of drinking water (obtained from SRMIST common source point) to ZnPc2, we have not observed any significant changes in emission
spectra, indicating that drinking water does not have trace amounts
of TNP. We have also tested river water obtained from the banks of
Palar river near Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu. The river water was used
as an analyte and a solvent medium. In the first experiment, different
amounts of river water are directly added to the ZnPc2 solution, and changes in the emission maxima are monitored. Upon
addition of 100 μL of river water, we have observed 11% quenching
of emission maxima (Figure S24a, Supporting Information). In the second experiment, we have prepared the stock solution
of TNP using river water and treated with ZnPc2. Interestingly,
upon addition of 150 μM of TNP, we have observed 84% quenching
efficiency that reflects the potential applicability of ZnPc2 for the real-time analysis (Figure S24b, Supporting Information).

Toward the solid-state sensors
for explosives, we have prepared
thin films of ZnPcs by the spin-coating method on quartz substrates
as described earlier.41 The solid-state
emission spectra of ZnPcs in thin films showed that the peaks are
slightly broadened and red-shifted by 8 ± 2 nm compared to that
in aqueous media. The fluorescence response of thin films upon exposure
to saturated vapors of different nitro compounds was monitored as
a function of time. Interestingly, we have observed that ZnPcs exhibit
high fluorescence quenching toward TNP vapors. Figure 8a shows change in the emission intensity
of ZnPc2 to TNP vapors. The fluorescence intensity gradually
decreased with respect to the time of exposure without change in the
position of peak maxima. The emission intensity remarkably decreased
initially and showed slower response for the prolonged time of exposure.
Upon exposure of thin films to TNP vapors for 240 s, ZnPc2 exhibits the quenching efficiencies of 28.6, 9.8, 9.2, and 7.5%
toward TNP, TNT, DNP, and DNT vapors, respectively. Upon exposure
of thin films to TNP vapors for 18 mins, we have observed the quenching
efficiency of 80.7% and reached a plateau. With further increase in
the exposure time, no remarkable changes in emission were observed
(Figure 8b). ZnPc1 exhibits ∼49.1% decrease in the quenching efficiency.

Figure 8 (a) Change
in the fluorescence intensity of ZnPc2 upon
exposure to the saturated vapors of TNP at different time intervals.
(b) Change in the quenching efficiency of ZnPcs with TNP vapors at
different time intervals. (c) Quenching efficiency of ZnPcs to different
vapors of NACs.

The overall order of
quenching efficiency was found to be TNP >
TNT ≈ DNP > DNT > NP > NT > NB, indicating that
ZnPc2 exhibits high selectivity toward TNP and is found
to have 1.6 times
higher sensitivity than ZnPc1 (Figure 8c). The variation in the sensitivity may
arise due to variations in the structures of ZnPc and morphology of
the films in the solid state. The DFT-optimized structure of ZnPc2 shows a bowl shape structure, which allows for easy encapsulation
of guest molecules, whereas ZnPc1 exhibits a nonplanar
distorted structure. The scanning electron microscopy image of the
films shows spherical and ordered crystalline structures for ZnPc1 and ZnPc2, respectively (Figure S25, Supporting Information). The variations in the
morphology of ZnPcs and increase in the number of DMAP units facilitate
to have better interactions and furnish variations in the selectivity
toward NACs vapors. The ordered crystalline morphology provides large
contact area to capture more analyte molecules and trigger larger
signal change. Although the vapor pressure of NB (4 × 105 ppb) and TNT (7.7 × 10–3 ppb) is higher
than that of TNP (7.7 × 10–3 ppb), ZnPcs exhibit
good interactions through π–π and electrostatic
interactions with the acidic nature of the TNP vapors.

Figure 9 shows confocal
fluorescence microscopy image of ZnPcs before and after exposure to
the vapors of TNP. The red fluorescence in the films is completely
diminished in ZnPc2 films, indicating its potential use
to design infrared-based fluorescence detectors because of their diffusion
ability. The reversibility and recycling ability of the films were
further evaluated by exposing the films to TNP vapors for 15 min and
washed with methanol and dried under N2 gas flow for 10
min. From Figure S26 (Supporting Information), the emission intensity of the virgin film decreased upon exposure
to TNP vapors and retains the emission after washing with methanol.
We have observed only 6% decrease in the emission intensity even after
8 cycles and presumably attain the efficient quenching process, indicating
that ZnPc films exhibit high reversibility and recycling ability.42

saturated vapors of TNP (scale bar 20 μm).

Our major research emphasis is to design the novel molecular
materials
toward the detection of explosive compounds and to in situ convert
them into fine chemicals. Nitrophenolic compounds are known to undergo
reduction in the presence of NaBH4 and other reducing agents
to form a corresponding aminophenol thermodynamically.43 Some of MPcs and double decker lanthanide Pcs
were used directly and impregnated with TiO2 and other
metal oxides toward the photocatalytic degradation in aqueous suspension.44−46 In this regard, we anticipated that developed ZnPcs have the ability
toward selective detection of TNP and could also possibly act as a
photocatalyst for the degradation of TNP. In a typical experiment,
TNP was mixed with NaBH4 in a 3 mL quartz cuvette in ethanol
solution. The solutions immediately turned bright yellow (λabs = 396 nm) from light yellow (λabs = 354
nm), which indicates the formation of phenolate ions. ZnPc2 (3 mg) was added to the resulting solution and irradiated under
white light (9.0 mW cm–2). Changes in the absorbance
were monitored by an absorption spectrophotometer.

The absorption
maxima at ∼396 nm is gradually decreased
as a function of time with appearance of a new absorption peak at
263 nm, indicating the formation of 2,4,6-triaminophenol (TAP).47Figure 10 shows that the absorption at ∼396 nm decreases and
shows the conversion rate of 30% for an exposure period of 24 h. With
further increase in the exposure time, we have not observed any substantial
changes in the conversion process. A control experiment was carried
out without addition of ZnPc2 to understand the role
of a photocatalyst. In the absence of ZnPc2, we have
not observed any significant changes in the absorption maxima at ∼396
nm, indicating the significant role of ZnPc2 as a photocatalyst
in the reduction process by formation of singlet oxygen (1O2). Further, optimization of the reaction conditions
with an increase in the dose of the catalyst, power, and hydrogen
source for phenolate to improve the catalytic conversion of nitro
phenol analytes with faster reaction kinetics in the reduction process
without altering the sensing ability and selectivity of ZnPcs is under
investigation.

of
NaBH4 and ZnPc2 in ethanol solution under
the irradiation of white light.

Conclusions
Novel water-soluble ZnPcs with four and eight
DMAP units at the
periphery were synthesized and characterized. The photophysical properties,
singlet oxygen generation, and stability/photostability were investigated.
Increase in the number of DMAP groups on ZnPc enhances the conjugation
and showed a significant effect in the photophysical properties. ZnPc2 exhibits J-type aggregates at higher concentrations, and
both compounds show high singlet oxygen generation. Fluorescence studies
of ZnPc1 and ZnPc2 treated with different
NACs show a fluorescence quenching behavior with unprecedented selectivity
toward TNP in the aqueous medium. The quenching rate constants were
found to be 1.6 × 105 and 2.02 × 105 for ZnPc1 and ZnPc2 with LODs of 1.1 ±
0.1 and 0.7 ± 0.1 ppm, respectively. By corroborating fluorescence
and NMR studies, the PET process through donor–acceptor π–π
interactions and electrostatic interaction between the dimethylamine
unit of DMAP and TNP is predominant for the quenching process. The
vapor-phase studies demonstrate that ZnPc2 shows 1.6
times higher sensitivity than ZnPc1, which may be due
to variation in the morphology in the solid state, and the bowl shape
of ZnPc2 furnishes cavity-based selectivity in terms
of the size and efficient interaction of nitro analyte vapors. The
preliminary heterogeneous photocatalytic studies demonstrate that
developed compounds show 31% of catalytic activity in the reduction
of TNP to corresponding TAP. This work provides an interesting perspective
on the elaboration of unique fluorescent molecular systems, which
can show selective sensing of specific nitro analytes and convert
them into useful chemicals. Current efforts are now being made toward
the design of fluorescent receptors, which act as selective sensors
as well as heterogeneous catalyst/photocatalysts in the efficient
reduction of nitro analytes.

Materials and Methods
All chemicals
of analytical grade were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
and used as received. Solvents were purified by distillation, and
reagents were used without further purification. The 1H
and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in a Bruker NMR equipment
(300.13 and 75.47 MHz). Chemical shifts are reported in parts per
million. The final mass of the compounds was confirmed by a MALDI-Micromass
Q-TOF2 equipment. UV–vis spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000
UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer. Steady-state fluorescence
emission studies were carried out on a Jobin-Yvon FluoroMax 3 spectrofluorometer.
Fluorescence quantum yields were determined using the unsubstituted
ZnPc (ΦF = 0.20) as the reference.31 Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were carried out
with the TCSPC method with a picosecond LED (635 nm, pulse width <200
ps) being used to excite the samples. Photostability, stability, photobleaching,
and singlet oxygen studies were carried out as described in the literature.32 Thin films of ZnPcs were prepared by a spin-coating
method by dissolving 1 mg of compound in 200 μL, which was spin-coated
on the quartz substrate. Thin films were annealed at 70 °C overnight
and stored in the vacuum desiccator. Solid-state fluorescence quenching
studies were performed by exposing the films to the saturated vapors
of nitro analytes, and emission data were collected by the front face
method. Confocal microscopic images of thin films were obtained in
LSM 710 Carl Zeiss laser scanning microscope. Caution: TNP, TNT, and other NACs used in the present study have explosive
nature and should be handled only in small quantities.
