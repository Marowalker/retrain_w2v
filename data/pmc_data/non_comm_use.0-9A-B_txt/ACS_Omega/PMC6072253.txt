IIIM-290, a semisynthetic
derivative of natural product rohitukine,
is an orally bioavailable Cdk inhibitor, efficacious in the xenograft
models of colon, pancreatic, and leukemia cancer. Its low aqueous
solubility (∼8.6 μg/mL) could be one of the reasons for
achieving optimal in vivo efficacy relatively at a higher dose. Being
a nitrogenous compound, salt formation was envisaged as one of the
ideal approaches to enhance its solubility and dissolution profile.
Thus, herein, a solubility-guided miniaturized 96-well plate salt
screening protocol was devised for identification of the suitable
salt form of this preclinical candidate. The solubility-guided strategy
has resulted in the identification of hydrochloride as the most favorable
counterion, resulting in 45-fold improvement in aqueous solubility.
The HCl salt was then scaled up at a gram size and characterized using 1H and 13C NMR, scanning electron microscopy, powder
X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared, and differential scanning
calorimetry studies. The HCl salt displayed enhancement in the in
vitro dissolution profile as well as improved plasma exposure in the
pharmacokinetic study. The oral administration of the IIIM-290·HCl
salt in BALB/c mice resulted in >1.5-fold improvement in areas
under
the curve, Cmax, and half-life. The prepared
salt also did not alter its cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-2 and Cdk-9
inhibition activity. This biopharmaceutically improved lead has a
potential to investigate further in preclinical studies. The solubility-guided
salt screening strategy implemented herein could be utilized for other
preclinical leads.

==== Body
Introduction
The solubility of a
drug molecule containing an ionized functional
group is frequently enhanced by preparing its suitable salt form.
Usually, the salt form of a drug is more soluble in an aqueous medium
than its nonionized form and is an effective method for increasing
the dissolution rate of drugs. A suitable salt form can modulate physicochemical
properties and thus in vivo performance of many drug candidates.1 Selection of an optimized or appropriate salt
form is a crucial step in the drug discovery and development process
as it has a profound impact on biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical
properties.2−6 The selection of a right salt form during the discovery program
also reduces the development timeline of a new drug candidate.7 The salt screening and solid form selection in
early drug discovery has a major impact on both preclinical and clinical
developments of the lead candidate.8 In
a typical organic chemistry laboratory, the preparation of salt of
any organic compound requires atleast 50 mg quantity of the compound.
Thus, optimization of a suitable counterion using such a strategy
in a chemistry lab would require a larger amount of compound, may
be up to 1–2 g. However, gram-sized quantities are only available
when the molecule enters in the developmental stages.9 To address this need, researchers have attempted to miniaturize
screening procedures such as high-throughput methods to identify potential
salts.10−13

Rohitukine is a chromone alkaloid isolated from Indian medicinal
plant Dysoxylum binectariferum Hook.
(Meliaceae).14−16 This natural product has inspired the discovery of
two clinical candidates, viz. flavopiridol17,18 and riviciclib,19 among which the former
has also received orphan drug status from U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia18 and acute myeloid leukemia.20 Recently, our group has discovered an orally bioavailable preclinical
candidate, IIIM-290, from this scaffold.21,22 IIIM-290, (1′R,2′S)-2-(2,6-dichlorostyryl)-5,7-dihydroxy-8-(3-hydroxy-1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)-4H-chromen-4-one (Figure 1), is a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase-9
(Cdk-9) exhibiting in vivo efficacy in colon, pancreatic, and leukemia
xenograft models. It inhibits Cdk-9 with IC50 of 1.9 nM
and exhibits cellular antiproliferative activity with the GI50 of 1.0 μM in leukemia and pancreatic cancer cell lines. In
spite of its potent in vitro activity profile, the optimal in vivo
efficacy was obtained at 50 mg/kg dose, which is relatively higher
than the theoretical requirement.21 It
is a basic compound (pKa = 5.4) with moderate
solubility in water and in biorelevant media (pH 1.2–7.4).
The experimental octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) and distribution coefficient (log D) of IIIM-290 are 3.09 and 1.65, respectively. The inadequate aqueous
solubility could be one of the reasons for its poor in vitro–in
vivo correlation. To address the low solubility concern of this compound,
the identification of an appropriate salt form of IIIM-290 was planned.
Hence, we aimed at developing a screening procedure to identify the
optimum salt form/s to improve its solubility and dissolution, which
in turn is expected to modulate the in vivo exposure.

Figure 1 Chemical structure of
IIIM-290 and its physicochemical and efficacy
data.

The present study describes miniaturized
salt screening with various
counterions to identify a suitable salt of IIIM-290. The solubility-guided
screening was performed for the selection of appropriate counterions.
With this screening approach, we focused on maximizing the hit rate
in terms of solubility, its selection for scale-up, and subsequent
characterization. The impact of optimum salt form/s on the solubility
and dissolution of IIIM-290 was studied. The identified salt form
was prepared in gram quantity and was completely characterized for
its physicochemical parameters, in vitro dissolution profile, in vitro
efficacy, and oral pharmacokinetics in mice.

Results and Discussion
Identification
of Appropriate Counterion/s via Solubility-Guided
Salt Screening
The developed solubility-based miniaturized
protocol for the identification of a suitable counterion utilized
a very small amount of compound (∼100 mg), which can be manageable
at the drug discovery stage. Therefore, it can be applied to early
drug discovery and development where efforts on the preclinical candidate
are required to make it druggable. The counterions for the salt screening
experiment were chosen based on the criteria of pKa difference of ≥2 between the counterion and IIIM-290.
On the basis of the pKa values of counterions,
phosphoric acid (PA) (2.15,
7.21, 12.32), maleic acid (MA) (1.9, 6.07), malonic acid (MlnA) (2.83,
5.69), oxalic acid (OA) (1.2, 4.2), HCl (−7), 4-aminobenzoic
acid (4-ABA) (2.38), succinic acid (SA) (4.2, 5.6), fumaric acid (FA)
(3.5, 4.5), formic acid (FoA) (3.77), hippuric acid (HA) (3.59), toluene
sulfonic acid (TSA) (−2.8), and citric acid (CA) (3.73, 4.76,
6.4) were selected for primary salt screening with the possibility
of formation of salt with IIIM-290 (pKa = 5.4). Upon addition of counterion solutions and reaction solvents
to the wells preloaded with IIIM-290, it was observed that the orange
color of IIIM-290 turned to yellow in all wells except for 4-ABA and
SA, which provided an indication of the chemical reaction between
the respective counterion and the compound. The product formed in
the wells was solid except for those wherein acetone/isopropyl alcohol
(IPA) (50:50 v/v) and EtOH/acetonitrile (ACN) (50:50 v/v) were used
as reaction solvents. These solvents yielded a solvated mass at the
bottom of the well. Therefore, these two solvent combinations were
omitted during secondary screening experiments. Furthermore, the in
situ determination of thermodynamic equilibrium solubility data showed
improved solubility of IIIM-290 in the wells loaded with HCl, FoA,
and HA as counterions (Figure 2a). The average water solubility values of IIIM-290 in the
presence of equimolar concentrations of HCl, FoA, and HA were found
to be 483.87, 496.96, and 506.1 μg/mL, respectively. The data
was statistically analyzed using Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
test (P < 0.05) using GraphPad Prism 6.01.

(b). Effect of different ratios of IIIM-290 to counterions on water

On the basis of the observation
from primary screening, IIIM-290
in combination with HCl, FoA, and HA was studied for improvement in
the solubility of IIIM-290, if any, using different molar ratios,
viz., 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4. Reaction solvents acetone/IPA (50:50 v/v)
and EtOH/ACN (50:50 v/v) were exempted during secondary screening
as they yielded solvated mass during primary screening. The average
solubility of all of the experiments performed during secondary screening
is depicted in Figure 2b. There was no proportionate increase in the aqueous solubility
of IIIM-290 with counterions HA, HCl, and FoA in 1:2 and 1:4 ratios.
The reason behind this observation was attributed to the fact that
IIIM-290 contains only one site required for salt formation (piperidine
ring containing single N). Formic acid was also eliminated from further
scale-up studies because it does not fall under the category of salt
forms that were approved by the FDA.23 Hence,
the scale-up of hydrochloride and hippurate salts of IIIM-290 was
considered for further studies.

Scale-up Synthesis of Selected
IIIM-290 Salts
The solubility
of IIIM-290 in methanol was only ∼0.5 mg/mL and is the limiting
factor for scale-up synthesis. Hence, a combination of MeOH with water
and CHCl3 was tried to find out the optimum reaction solvent
mixture that is suitable for scale-up synthesis. The process was optimized
from 25 to 2000 mg scale. In the experiments involving hippuric acid
as the counterion, various combinations of reaction solvents were
used viz. MeOH/H2O (80:20 v/v), MeOH/CHCl3 (25:75
v/v), MeOH/CHCl3/H2O (70:20:10 v/v), and MeOH/CHCl3 (75:25 v/v). Solubility of IIIM-290 was >10 mg/mL in the
MeOH/CHCl3 (75:25 v/v) mixture. However, the product obtained
using all solvent combinations as mentioned above showed amorphous
melting between 120 and 140 °C. Furthermore, the product obtained
by reacting IIIM-290 with hydrochloric acid in the presence of MeOH/H2O (80:20 v/v), MeOH/CHCl3 (25:75 v/v), and MeOH/CHCl3 (75:25 v/v) as reaction solvents showed the melting point
of 312–315 °C. The obtained products were characterized
and confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. Briefly, MeOH/CHCl3 (75:25
v/v) was identified as the optimum reaction solvent for scale-up of
IIIM-290 salt/s.

1H NMR and 13C NMR
The quaternization
of the tertiary nitrogen atom in any organic compound gets reflected
in the 1H NMR spectrum as a downfield shift in δ
ppm values of hydrogen present on adjacent carbons. As expected, the 1H NMR spectroscopy of the IIIM-290·HCl salt showed a
downfield shift in δ ppm values of the hydrogens of the piperidine
ring. The difference in the chemical shifts of protons near the nitrogen
atom in the 1H NMR spectrum of the free base and HCl salt
was observed (Figure 3a). In general, a trend of downfield shift of chemical shift values
of protons present near the tertiary nitrogen was observed in the
HCl salt in comparison to that in the free base. The notable differences
include the N–CH3 group and the −CH2 groups connected with a tertiary amine. The chemical shift value
of the N–Me group in the free base was 2.56 ppm, which was
downfield-shifted by 0.18 ppm in the HCl salt (to 2.74 ppm). One proton
of the 6″-CH2 group appears at 1.50 ppm in the free
base; however, it has been downfield-shifted by 0.18 ppm in the HCl
salt (to 1.87 ppm). The region of 2.79–3.43 ppm for other methylene
protons from the piperidine ring (H-3″, H-5″, H-1″,
H-6″) has also been shifted downfield (to 3.15–3.53
ppm) in the case of the HCl salt. The −CH proton (H-2″)
of the piperidine ring has been slightly downfield-shifted by 0.05
ppm (shifted from 4.04 to 4.09 ppm) in the HCl salt. Interestingly,
the H-3 and H-6 protons of the chromone ring were significantly downfield-shifted
in the HCl salt. The H-3 proton appearing at 5.81 ppm in free base
has been downfield-shifted by 0.59 ppm (shifted to 6.40 ppm in the
HCl salt). Similarly, the H-6 proton appearing at 6.33 ppm in free
base has been shifted by 0.22 ppm (shifted to 6.55 ppm in the HCl
salt). There was no change in the chemical shift values of the styryl
ring. 1H chemical shift perturbations observed for the
IIIM-290·HCl salt are shown in Figure 3b. The 1H NMR spectrum of IIIM-290
hippurate did not show any change in chemical shift values of piperidine
ring protons, indicating no quaternarization on the tertiary nitrogen.
We also compared the 13C NMR spectra of the free base and
HCl salt (Figure S10, Supporting Information).
There was around 2 ppm shift in chemical shift values of all six carbons
(region of δ 22.62–66.39 ppm) present in the piperidine
ring (including N–Me). However, the aromatic region (δ
99.81–182.71 ppm) of the 13C NMR spectrum was not
affected by salt formation. Thus, the NMR study confirmed the successful
formation of the HCl salt; however, no such observation was noted
in the case of the hippurate form, which indicated no any chemical
interaction and thus no salt formation. It led to the formation of
only an amorphous mixture.

the IIIM-290·HCl salt.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-Transform Infrared
(FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Powder X-ray Diffraction
(p-XRD) Analyses
The increase in the melting point of the
salt form is usually accompanied by enhanced thermodynamic stability,
easier processing conditions, and improved relative compatibility
with formulation excipients.24 The thermal
features of salts were revealed from DSC thermograms, as shown in Figure 4. DSC data of both
IIIM-290 and IIIM-290·HCl showed a sharp melting endotherm at
247 and 324 °C, respectively. The IIIM-290·HCl salt showed
a much higher melting point (∼77 °C) than that of its
free base. The physical mixture of IIIM-290 and hippuric acid showed
no amorphous transformation, which was evident due to their melting
endotherm at 255 and 192 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the absence
of melting endotherm in IIIM-290 hippurate indicated conversion of
IIIM-290 to an amorphous state.

Figure 4 DSC curves of IIIM-290 and its salt forms.

The moisture in salts is one of
the important developability parameters
and has direct correlation with its chemical stability.5,25 The moisture contents in IIIM-290, IIIM-290·HCl, and IIIM-290
hippurate form, at the end of 6 months, were determined by the loss
on drying method. The % moisture contents of IIIM-290, IIIM-290·HCl,
and IIIM-290 hippurate form were found to be 3.5, 5, and 8.2% w/w,
respectively. The FTIR spectra of IIIM-290·HCl (Figure S12) and IIIM-290 hippurate forms (Figure S13) showed broad peaks at 3418 and 3400 cm–1, respectively, accounting for the moisture associated with it. IIIM-290
as a free base also showed the peak at 3416 cm–1, for the −OH functionality present in its structure; however,
the enhanced intensity of this peak in the HCl salt and hippurate
form indicated moisture in the samples. The endotherm at 100 °C
in the DSC spectrum of IIIM-290·HCl further confirmed the presence
of moisture.

FTIR measurements of IIIM-290 and its salt forms
were compared
(Figures S11–S14). The assignments
of some characteristic absorption bands are summarized in Table S1. The peaks in “region 1”
due to the O–H stretching were absent in IIIM-290 hippurate,
indicating amorphous transformation. The C–H and C–N
stretching absorptions for IIIM-290 and its HCl salt, in region 2
and 4, indicated distinguished vibrations.

The morphology of
IIIM-290, IIIM-290·HCl, IIIM-290 hippurate
form and the physical mixture of IIIM-290 with hippuric acid was assessed
by SEM. Intense morphological difference was observed between IIIM-290
(Figure 5a,b) and IIIM-290·HCl
salt (Figure 5c,d)
in SEM images. SEM micrographs revealed a rod-shaped (10–20
μm) morphology of IIIM-290, elongated needles (30–70
μm) of IIIM-290·HCl, and flakelike irregular aggregates
(2–10 μm; Figure 5e,f) of the IIIM-290 hippurate form, indicating mixture of
crystalline and amorphous particles. The physical mixture of hippuric
acid and IIIM-290 showed a mixture of rods and flakes.

free base (a, b), IIIM-290·HCl (c,
d), and IIIM-290 hippurate form (e, f).

Their physical state was also evaluated by powder XRD (Figure 6). The p-XRD patterns
of IIIM-290 and its HCl salt were distinctive, with the appearance
of new, sharp, and characteristic peaks indicating the formation of
a pure crystalline solid, and this was in agreement with 1H and 13C NMR data. The physical mixture of IIIM-290 and
hippuric acid retained crystallinity in comparison to that of the
IIIM-290 hippurate form, wherein the p-XRD pattern indicated reduced
crystallinity of IIIM-290.

forms.

Solubility, Partition Coefficient,
in Vitro Dissolution, Kinetic
Solubility, and pH-Solubility Profile
Solubility and partition
coefficient (log P) are important preformulation
parameters that have a direct impact on the absorption of orally administered
drugs. Salt formation is one approach to improving the solubility
of the poorly soluble drug candidate. IIIM-290·HCl and IIIM-290
hippurate demonstrated high water solubility as compared to that of
free base (8.61 ± 1.8 μg/mL). The thermodynamic equilibrium
solubility values of IIIM-290·HCl and hippurate were 362.23 ±
38.39 and 360.02 ± 13.19 μg/mL, respectively. There was
∼40-fold improvement in water solubility of both forms in comparison
to that of the free base. The solubility data was in agreement with
log P value, which is a measure of lipophilicity.
Log P of IIIM-290·HCl was 1.82 ±
0.14, indicating the hydrophilic nature of salt over the free drug
(log P = 3.1 ± 0.22). Interestingly,
the IIIM-290 hippurate form showed enhanced solubility; however, no
change in log P was observed with that of
the free base. The plausible reason for significant improvement in
solubility of IIIM-290 is the formation of a eutectic mixture between
IIIM-290 and hippuric acid. Furthermore, 1H NMR data confirmed
no chemical interaction between IIIM-290 and hippuric acid. When 1H NMR of the IIIM-290 hippurate form was compared with that
of IIIM-290, no change in chemical shift was observed, which ruled
out the possibility of formation of cocrystals of IIIM-290 with hippuric
acid. If cocrystals have formed, due to the hydrogen bonding between
IIIM-290 and hippuric acid, the chemical shift of participating atoms
should have moved downfield because of increase in electron density.

For poorly soluble drugs, in traditional dissolution methods, sink
conditions are recommended to discriminate the dissolution profiles
of the poorly soluble compound/active pharmaceutical ingredient and
its formulations. Dissolution testing of any solid oral dosage form
involves either the basket or the paddle apparatus, which is based
on the principle of operating under “sink conditions”.26 The standardized conditions are chosen to provide
a gentle hydrodynamic regimen. “Physiological” media
or solutions incorporating surfactants are preferred over water/organic
solvent mixtures. According to pharmacopoeial and regulatory considerations,
the sink condition is defined as an excess solubilizing capacity of
dissolution medium, wherein the concentration of the compound in dissolution
media is 3–10 times higher than the saturation solubility of
the compound.27−29 Particularly, in this case, the saturation solubility
of IIIM-290 in water is ∼8.61 ± 1.8 μg/mL; thus,
different concentrations of surfactants, namely, sodium lauryl sulfate
(SLS), Tween 80, and Tween 40, were attempted to identify appropriate
sink conditions. The saturation solubility of IIIM-290 and its sink
index at different concentrations of surfactants is shown in Figure 7a,b, respectively.
There was no linear increase observed in the solubility of IIIM-290
in Tween 80 and Tween 40. A linear increase in solubility of IIIM-290
was noted in 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5% w/v SLS solutions. The sink
index was calculated, and for dissolution experiments, 0.25% w/v SLS
was added to physiological media to maintain sink conditions.

Figure 7 (a) Saturation
solubility in surfactants, namely, SLS, Tween 80,
and Tween 40. (b) Plot of sink index against surfactant concentrations.

The in vitro dissolution profiles
of IIIM-290, HCl salt, and hippurate
form under sink conditions (0.25% w/v SLS) are depicted in Figure 8. The results are
summarized in Table 1, and their dissolution performance can be more objectively compared
using the areas under the curve (AUC) obtained from the concentration–time
profiles. Enhancement in the dissolution and AUC0–t of IIIM-290·HCl in comparison to those of the
free base was observed in water as well as in physiological media,
namely, HCl (pH 1.2) and phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). However, the IIIM-290
hippurate form showed a lower dissolution rate and AUC0–t than those of the free base. The comparatively low
dissolution rate of the IIIM-290 hippurate form may be attributed
to the coformer, hippuric acid. The dissolution values of IIIM-290,
HCl salt, and hippurate form in water at the end of 120 min were 49,
78, and 12% w/v, respectively (Figure 8a). Similarly, as shown in Figure 8b, the % drug dissolved in HCl buffer (pH
1.2) at 30 min for the IIIM-290·HCl salt was 99% in comparison
to that for its
free base (83%) and hippurate form (71% w/v). The same observation
was noted down (Figure 8c) when dissolution was performed in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). At
the end of 60 min, the HCl salt showed a higher dissolution (84%)
compared to that of IIIM-290 and its hippurate form (63 vs 26% w/v).
At acidic pH 1.2, which corresponds to a fasting state of the stomach,
both components, viz., IIIM-290 and its HCl salt, were highly soluble,
as might be expected (Figure 8b).

or IIIM-290 hippurate form.

However, whether a drug is acidic or basic, most of its absorption
occurs in the small intestine (pH 6–8)30 and hence the dissolution at pH 6.8 is more relevant. In summary,
the dissolution enhancement is due to the salt formation as typically
seen for pharmaceuticals.3

The time-dependent
solubility of the free base and its HCl salt
at 37 °C was determined to find out their extent of supersaturation
state in water. The HCl salt of IIIM-290 allows it to remain in the
solution state for a longer period in comparison with the parent compound
(Figure 8d). The HCl
salt form of IIIM-290 evidenced to inhibit its crystallization for
a prolonged period of time (the “parachute” effect).31 The sustained parachute effect provides high
apparent solubility, which is responsible for the improvement in its
efficacy.

The experimental and calculated pHmax values
were determined
from the pH-solubility profile of the IIIM-290·HCl salt. pHmax is the pH value above which the salt can potentially convert
to its free base form. The pHmax was calculated using formula
pHmax = pKa + log(sol FB/sol
HCl). The calculated and experimental pHmax values for
the IIIM-290·HCl salt were 3.59 and 3.0, respectively, which
were in accordance with each other (Figure 9). The pH shift after solubility determination
in water was also monitored, and it was 3.6. The pHmax is
crucial to determine the instability issue of salt during developmental
stages and thus excipients which will elevate microenvironmental pH
above the pHmax can be avoided during formulation development
of salts.

In Vitro Inhibition of Cdk-2/A and Cdk-9/T1
and Pharmacokinetics
of the IIIM-290·HCl Salt
To test the potency of HCl
salt of IIIM-290, the kinase inhibition of Cdk-2/A and Cdk-9/T1 was
studied in comparison to the free base at a concentration of 500 nM.
The % inhibition data is depicted in Table 2, which supported retained biological activity
by the HCl salt form.

The pharmacokinetics of IIIM-290 and its HCl salt was evaluated
in BALB/c mice following a single 50 mg/kg dose administration by
oral route. The exposure (Cmax and AUC0–∞) of the IIIM-290·HCl salt was higher
than that of the free base and was found to be 1030 versus 656 ng/mL
and 3710 versus 2570 ng h/mL, respectively. The elimination half-life
(T1/2) values were found to be 1.92 and
5.06 h, respectively, for the free base and IIIM-290·HCl salt.
This indicated decreased clearance of IIIM-290 when administered as
a salt form. Overall, the pharmacokinetic exposure following oral
administration of the IIIM-290·HCl salt was higher compared to
for the free base. The data presented in Table 3 indicated improved ADME parameters of the
HCl salt over IIIM-290 as a free base. Furthermore, the AUC0–t ratio obtained from the in vitro dissolution result
was in agreement with the pharmacokinetic studies of IIIM-290·HCl
with respect to its free base (1.47 vs 1.44).

Conclusions
The oral route is the
most preferred way of drug administration.
However, solubility and dissolution of the drug candidate are the
limiting factors for its oral absorption. Our investigation enabled
successful development of the HCl salt of IIIM-290 with improved solubility
and dissolution with better pharmacokinetic exposure. This research
enabled successful development of solubility-based miniaturized 96-well
plate salt screening methodology. The protocol was used for the identification
of a suitable counterion required for the preparation of the salt
of preclinical candidate, IIIM-290. The hydrochloride salt was identified
and prepared up to 2 g scale. The characterization by p-XRD, 1H and 13C NMR, FTIR, SEM, and DSC analyses confirmed
the formation of a new crystalline form. The HCl salt exhibited better
physicochemical properties such as high water solubility and decreased
log P value compared to those of the free
base. It also led to dissolution enhancements in different physiological
buffers (pH 1.2–6.8). Time-dependent solubility also proved
that the HCl salt allows IIIM-290 to remain in the solution state
for a longer period. The pharmacokinetic exposure of the IIIM-290·HCl
salt by the oral route in BALB/c mice was higher and comparable with
the free base.

Materials and Methods
Materials
The
preclinical candidate, IIIM-290, was
synthesized21 in the laboratory up to 60
g scale with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purity
of ∼99.7% w/w. Counterions, viz., phosphoric acid (PA) and
formic acid (FoA), were purchased from RFCL Limited (RANKEM), India.
Maleic acid (MA), succinic acid (SA), fumaric acid (FA), hippuric
acid (HA), 4-aminobenzoic acid (4-ABA), and toluene sulfonic acid
(TSA) were procured from Alfa Aesar, India. Malonic acid (MlnA) and
hydrochloric acid (HCl) were purchased from S. D. Fine Chem. Ltd,
India. Oxalic acid (OA) and citric acid (CA) were received from Merck
Ltd., India, and Sigma-Aldrich, India, respectively. HPLC-grade methanol
and water (Fisher Scientific, Mumbai) were used throughout the study.
HPLC (Shimadzu, LC-6AD), Chromolith performance RP-18e (100–4.6
mm, Merck) HPLC column, vortex (IKA vortex Genius 3), microplate shaker
(Eppendorf, ThermoMixer, Germany), microcentrifuge 5430R (Eppendorf),
sonicator and micropipettes (Eppendorf) were used for the study.

1H NMR spectrum was recorded on a Bruker-Avance DPX FT-NMR
400 MHz instrument. FTIR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer IR
spectrophotometer. Melting points were recorded using a Buchi melting
point M-560 apparatus. Differential scanning calorimetry was performed
using TA Instruments Q-10 DSC. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements
were carried out on a PANalytical’s X-ray diffractometer. Dissolution
studies were performed using the paddle method on a dissolution apparatus
(Labindia DS 8000) (Indian Pharmacopeia, 2007).

Primary Screening
for Selection of Counterion
Solutions
of IIIM-290 and respective counterions were loaded in a 96-well plate
in the equimolar ratio as shown in Figure 10. Into the 96-well plate, 50 μL of
methanolic solution (25 mM) of IIIM-290 was loaded, and the plate
was shaken at 50 °C and 300 rpm for evaporation of methanol.
The plate was further subjected to overnight drying by keeping it
in the desiccator. This exercise was performed to load accurately
a very small quantity of IIIM-290 (∼570 μg) into each
well. In the next step, 50 μL of 25 mM methanolic solution of
all counterions was prepared except for HCl, formic acid, and phosphoric
acid. Aqueous solutions (10 μL) of 125 mM volatile acids, viz.,
HCl, formic acid, and phosphoric acid, were used for the study. Furthermore,
200 μL of reaction solvents, as depicted in Figure 10, was added to the corresponding
wells. The 96-well plate was shaken at 300 rpm for 6–7 h, while
maintaining the temperature at 50 °C. This provided sufficient
time for the reaction to occur and for evaporation of the solvent.
Furthermore, the plate was stored in a vacuum desiccator for 24 h
for complete removal of solvent/s, if any. The physical characteristics
like change in the color and mass distribution pattern of the solid
mass formed in the wells were noted down. The equilibrium saturation
solubility of the product formed in each well was determined as per
our previously published protocol.32,33 Briefly, 200
μL of water was added to each well and the plate was shaken
at 300 rpm at 25 °C for 24 h. The obtained solution was transferred
to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 16 000 rpm at 25
°C. The supernatant was diluted appropriately with methanol and
analyzed by HPLC.

Secondary Screening To
Identify Optimum Counterion Ratio and
Reaction Solvent/s
On the basis of the solubility improvement
of IIIM-290 in primary screening, the counterions, viz., hippuric
acid, HCl, and formic acid, were selected further to identify the
optimum ratio of counterions with the compound, IIIM-290. Three different
molar ratios, viz., 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4, of the compound, IIIM-290,
and counterions were chosen. The compound and respective counterions
were loaded into the 96-well plate as mentioned in the above section.
The visual observation and the obtained solubility values are depicted
in Figure S15 (Supporting Information).
Reaction solvents such as the mixture acetone/IPA (50:50 v/v) and
EtOH/ACN (50:50 v/v) were not considered during the selection of the
optimum reaction solvents. The reason being they yielded solvated
material. The plate was dried overnight in the desiccator, and visual
observations of the product formed in each well were noted down. The
saturation solubility of all samples was determined as mentioned in
the earlier section.

Scale-up Synthesis of HCl and Hippurate Salt
of IIIM-290
For scale-up of HCl and hippurate salt of IIIM-290,
the reaction
vehicle comprising methanol in mixture with another solvent was selected
on the basis of the nature of the reaction mixture formed in the well.
The limiting factor for scale-up experiments was the low solubility
of IIIM-290 (0.5 mg/mL) in methanol. Hence, we tried CHCl3 in combination with MeOH to select the optimum reaction solvent
for scale-up of both the salt forms of IIIM-290. Various combinations
of reaction solvents, viz., MeOH, water, and CHCl3 with
each other, viz., MeOH/H2O (80:20 v/v), MeOH/CHCl3 (25:75 v/v), MeOH/CHCl3/H2O (70:20:10 v/v),
and MeOH/CHCl3 (75:25 v/v), were tried. The product formed
using different solvent combinations was characterized by the melting
behavior and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The initial experiments
were performed up to the scale of ∼25 mg.

On the basis
of the observations from above experiments, MeOH/CHCl3 (75:25
v/v) was selected as the solvent for scale-up studies. The batch size
was varied from 25 to 2000 mg with the solvent volume of 75 mL for
1 g of IIIM-290. Briefly, ∼1 g of IIIM-290 was dissolved in
75 mL of MeOH/CHCl3 (75:25 v/v). To this solution, the
respective counterion was added in equimolar quantities and the mixture
was stirred at 50 °C for 2 h, which was followed by evaporation
of solvent under reduced pressure. The obtained product was purified
by washing with CHCl3/C6H14 (70:30
v/v). The product yield was >95% w/w. The obtained salt forms were
stored in a vacuum desiccator till further characterization.

HPLC Method
for Estimation of IIIM-290 Concentration
The reversed-phase
HPLC method for estimation of IIIM-290 involved
reversed-phase C18 Chromolith performance RP-18e (100–4.6 mm)
column using a photodiode detector (SPD-M20A, Prominence, Shimadzu).
For gradient elution, CH3OH and 0.1% v/v formic acid in
water as a mobile phase
were pumped with the flow rate of 1 mL/min through pumps A and B (LC-6AD
Shimadzu), respectively. The gradient comprised 70% B for 0–2
min, 70–30% B for 2–10 min, 30% B for 10–12 min,
30–70% B for 12–17 min, and 70% B for 17–20 min.
The injection volume was 3.0 μL (SIL-20A HT Prominence auto-sampler).
The column oven (CTO-10ASVP) temperature was 37 °C. The calibration
curve was obtained by injecting methanolic solutions of IIIM-290 using
different concentrations, viz., 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 μg/mL
(r2 = 1.0; RSD < 6%). The retention
time of the compound was 11.99 min. Each analysis was performed in
triplicate.

1H NMR and 13C NMR
Analyses
The
chemical interaction, if any, among IIIM-290, counterions, and their
respective salt forms was studied by 1H NMR. Briefly, 1H NMR spectra of IIIM-290 along with its HCl salt and hippurate
form were recorded using a Bruker-Avance DPX FT-NMR 400 MHz instrument
using deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6). 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 125 or 100 MHz.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Thermal behavior
of IIIM-290 and its salt forms were recorded using a Q-10, TA Instruments
thermoanalyzer, which was equipped with Trios V4.1 software. The instrument
was calibrated using indium for temperature and enthalpy change. For
thermal analysis, 3–5 mg of the sample was placed in a sealed
aluminum pan and scanned from 40 to 400 °C at the heating rate
of 10 °C/min. The onset temperature and enthalpy change for each
thermal event were calculated.

Fourier-Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy
FTIR analysis
was performed using a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrophotometer equipped
with spectrum software version 10.03.06. FTIR spectra were obtained
from 16 scans over the range of 4000–700 cm–1. KBr disks were prepared by grinding 2 mg of the sample with 200
mg of KBr and the pellet was directly compressed by applying pressure
of 2–3 t for 2 min.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Representative SEM
images of IIIM-290 samples were taken using a scanning electron microscope,
JEOL JSM-IT300, with gold coating. For the SEM observations, each
sample was fixed on an aluminum sample holder using double-sided carbon
tape.

Powder X-ray Diffraction
Powder X-ray diffraction measurements
were carried out on a PANalytical’s X’Pert Pro X-ray
diffractometer. For X-ray radiation source, a Cu Kα (λ
= 45 kV, 40 mA) anode was used, ranging 2θ between 5 and 50°
with 0.5 s/step scan rate with 0.017° increment.

Solubility
and Partition Coefficient Determination
The thermodynamic
equilibrium solubility in water and partition coefficient
(log P) of HCl and hippurate salt of IIIM-290
were determined using our previously published protocols.32 For determining solubility in water, briefly,
in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, an excess of the sample was added
to 500 μL of water, which was mixed using a vortex mixer for
5 min. The samples were further shaken at 300 rpm at 25 °C for
24 h. Eppendorf tubes were centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10
min, and the supernatant was analyzed using the developed HPLC method
to find out solubility of samples. Furthermore, the log P value was determined by our previously reported and validated
miniaturized shake flask method.33 Briefly,
in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, 200 μL of the stock solution
of IIIM-290 and its salt forms (1000 μg/mL prepared in n-octanol) was added. The volume was made up to 1 mL with
300 μL of presaturated n-octanol and 500 μL
of presaturated water. Eppendorf tubes were shaken overnight at 500
rpm and centrifuged at 16 000 RCF (G-force) for 20 min to separate
aqueous and organic layers. The concentration of the compound in both,
organic and aqueous, phases was determined by the HPLC method, as
mentioned in the above section. The presaturated solutions were used
wherein the organic phase consisted of n-octanol
saturated with water and the aqueous phase consisted of water saturated
with n-octanol.

Determination of Solubility
and Sink Conditions for Dissolution
Studies
Sink conditions were determined by measuring saturation
solubility of IIIM-290 using different concentrations of surfactants
(0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1% w/v) such as sodium lauryl sulfate
(SLS), Tween 80, and Tween 40.34 The sink
index was calculated for 10 mg of IIIM-290 in 250 mL of dissolution
media using the following equation  where Cs and Cd are the saturation solubility and concentration
of the compound in the dissolution medium, respectively.

Dissolution
Tests
All dissolution tests were carried
out at 37 ± 0.5 °C at 50 rpm using a USP dissolution apparatus
(Labindia dissolution tester, model: DS 8000; type 2, paddle) with
250 mL of dissolution medium. Sampling for all dissolution tests was
performed manually at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 360 min. Dissolution
of IIIM-290 and its salts was determined in water under sink conditions
using 0.25% w/v SLS. Apart from this, to mimic conditions of stomach
and intestine, in vitro dissolution was carried out under sink conditions,
as mentioned above, in HCl buffer (pH 1.2) and phosphate buffer (pH
6.8). At each sampling time, 1 mL of medium was removed and filtered
through a 0.45 μm poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) syringe
filter (Millex-HV, Bedford, Massachusetts), substituting 1 mL of fresh,
prewarmed medium to maintain the 250 mL volume. The obtained filtrate
was diluted appropriately with methanol and analyzed by the HPLC method.
All dissolution tests were performed in triplicate. The area under
the curve (AUC) was determined using trapezoidal rule integration
to the last time point (AUC0–t).
The maximum concentration (Cmax) and time
to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax) were also obtained. The extent of dissolution enhancement was quantified
from the AUC ratio ([AUC0–t,sample]/[AUC0–t,IIIM-290]).35

Kinetic Solubility Assessment
The
solubility of IIIM-290
and its HCl salt was also investigated over a period of 120 min. All
experiments were carried out using the HPLC method as described earlier.
The time-dependent solubility profile of IIIM-290 and the selected
salt form was measured in water at 37 °C. An excess of the compound
was added to 10 mL of water under shaking at 300 rpm. An aliquot of
1 mL was taken out at 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 120 min. The samples
were filtrated through a 0.45 μm PVDF syringe filter, diluted
with methanol, and analyzed by HPLC to find out solubility.

pH-Solubility
Profile of the IIIM-290·HCl Salt
The solubility of the
HCl salt of IIIM-290 was determined, as given
in the above section, at different pH values. Eight different USP
buffers were used: hydrochloric acid buffers pH 1.2 and 2.0 and phosphate
buffers pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0.36 The pH-solubility curve was plotted to determine the pHmax of the IIIM-290·HCl salt.

In Vitro Biological Activity
and Oral Pharmacokinetic Studies
The Cdk inhibition assay
was carried out using a radioactive (33P-ATP) filter-binding
assay at the International Centre for
Kinase Profiling, U.K. The assay for Cdk-2 and Cdk-9 was performed
as per our published protocol.21 The %
enzyme activity remaining in comparison to control was determined.
The data is reported as % inhibition, which is calculated as (100
– % enzyme activity).

Oral pharmacokinetic
studies of IIIM-290 and its HCl salt were carried out in BALB/c male
mice of age 8–13 weeks, by administering compounds orally at
a dose of 50 mg/kg in a selected vehicle (1% v/v Tween 80 + 0.5% w/v
sodium CMC q.s.). Blood samples were collected (n = 3/time point) at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h, postdose.
At each time point, about 120 μL of blood was collected by retro-orbital
sinus puncture into a labeled microfuge tube containing 2.4 μL
of 200 mM K2EDTA solution. The blood samples were processed
to obtain the plasma samples within 30 min of scheduled sampling time.
All plasma samples were stored below −60 °C until bioanalysis.
The plasma samples were analyzed for IIIM-290 using a fit-for-purpose
liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method with
a lower limit of quantification of 5.05 ng/mL. The PK parameters of
IIIM-290 were calculated using the noncompartmental analysis tool
of validated Phoenix WinNonlin software (version 6.3). The PK studies
were conducted at Eurofins Advinus Ltd., Bengaluru, on a commercial
basis (Institutional Animal Ethics Committee number: ATL-43_PKM-035/Jun-2017).
