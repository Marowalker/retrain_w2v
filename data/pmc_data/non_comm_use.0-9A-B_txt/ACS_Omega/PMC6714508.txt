The demand for rare earth elements
(REEs) has increased since the
1990s leading to the development of many mining projects worldwide.
However, less is known about how organisms can handle these metals
in natural aquatic systems. Through laboratory experiments, we assessed
the chronic toxicity and subcellular fractionation of yttrium (Y),
one of the four most abundant REEs, in three freshwater organisms
commonly used in aquatic toxicology: Daphnia magna, Chironomus riparius, and Oncorhynchus mykiss. In bioassays using growth as
an end point, C. riparius was the only
organism showing toxicity at Y exposure concentrations close to environmental
ones. The lowest observable effect concentrations (LOECs) of Y assessed
for D. magna and O.
mykiss were at least 100 times higher than the Y concentration
in natural freshwater. A negative correlation between Y toxicity and
water hardness was observed for D. magna. When exposed to their respective estimated LOECs, D. magna bioaccumulated 15–45 times more Y
than the other two organisms exposed to their own LOECs. This former
species sequestered up to 75% of Y in the NaOH-resistant fraction,
a putative metal-detoxified subcellular fraction. To a lesser extent, C. riparius bioaccumulated 20–30% of Y in
this detoxified fraction. In contrast, the Y subcellular distribution
in O. mykiss liver did not highlight
any notable detoxification strategy; Y was accumulated primarily in
mitochondria (ca. 32%), a putative metal-sensitive fraction. This
fraction was also the main sensitive fraction where Y accumulated
in C. riparius and D.
magna. Hence, the interaction of Y with mitochondria
could explain its toxicity. In conclusion, there is a wide range of
subcellular handling strategies for Y, with D. magna accumulating high quantities but sequestering most of it in detoxified
fractions, whereas O. mykiss tending
to accumulate less Y but in highly sensitive fractions.

Introduction
The global demand for
rare earth elements (REEs) is increasing
since the 1990s1,2 as a result of their use in almost
all activity sectors, from high technology and electrification of
transport to medicine and agriculture.3 Therefore, contamination of water ecosystems by these metals from
mining activity, agriculture, and the disposal of urban and electronic
wastes is of growing concern for environmental protection agencies.
Contamination of freshwater ecosystems by REEs has already been reported.4,5

The REE complexes formed with carbonates and organic matter
are
the dominant species of REEs in solution.6 These metals also have a strong affinity for clays7 and usually the solubility of REEs is very low.8 Weltje et al.9 have
reported that 99% of the REEs present in aquatic environments are
either related to a suspended matter or sediment. Dissolved concentrations
of REEs in these environments are therefore often very low, ranging
from 2.9 to 714 ng L–1 for Ce and 0.04–7
ng L–1 for Lu.10

Some studies on REE toxicity in freshwater organisms concluded
that even if REEs are a group of metals with similar chemical properties,
toxicity differences have been observed between heavy REEs (HREEs)
and light REEs (LREEs).11,12 Among the four most
abundant REEs, yttrium (Y) is the only one classified as a HREE. Nevertheless,
to our knowledge, in comparison with lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce),
and neodymium (Nd), Y toxicity has received less attention so far.
Yet, Y is needed in many high-technology applications such as optical
fiber and light-emitting diodes.3 Furthermore,
a recent study reported cytotoxicity linked to Y.13

Animal sensitivity toward metals and their handling
strategies
depend, among others, on the considered metal and species. Animals
can develop different combinations of strategies based on the regulation
of metal assimilation, excretion, and depuration. They can also handle
metal contamination at a subcellular level.14 Indeed, metal assimilated by an organism is partitioned between
subcellular components that can be operationally isolated through
procedures involving centrifugation, heating, and chemical digestion.15,16 Some of these components such as mitochondria and heat-denatured
proteins (HDP) such as enzymes appear sensitive to metals, and the
accumulation of metal in these metal-sensitive fractions (MSF) may
be related to their malfunction. On the contrary, metals accumulated
in other subcellular components, such as heat-stable proteins (HSP;
also called metallothionein-like proteins), and metal-rich granules
(MRG), such as lysosomal residual and phosphate-based bodies which
are included in the NaOH-resistant fraction, are considered by many
authors as metal-detoxified fractions (MDF).17 The proportion of bioaccumulated metals recovered between MDF and
MSF may explain the differences in sensitivity to metal accumulation
between organisms for a given metal.17,18

Hypotheses
and concepts related to metal thresholds for these two
kinds of fractions have been investigated in ecotoxicology since 2003.15 For example, the concept of “spillover”
assumes that a given metal only begins to accumulate in MSF when its
concentration in MDF exceeds a threshold.19 Similarly, the tissue residue approach considers that adverse toxicological
effects occur in organisms when a metal reaches a concentration threshold
on MSF.20

This study aims (1) to
evaluate Y chronic toxicity to three species
commonly used in aquatic toxicology—the water flea (Daphnia magna), the harlequin fly (Chironomus riparius), and the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)—and to define the lowest
observable effect concentrations (LOECs) and (2) to determine Y subcellular
distribution in each organism along exposure gradients including these
LOECs. LOECs are compared with the existing data on Y and REE concentrations
in freshwater ecosystems to better understand the actual ecotoxicological
risk induced by this metal on the environment. Also, the Y subcellular
detoxication strategy of each organism is discussed in light of their
strategies for other metals.

Results and Discussion
Toxicity and Bioaccumulation
in the Three Aquatic Animals Studied
The exposure conditions,
including Y concentrations, in the D. magna, C. riparius, and O. mykiss bioassays are presented
in the Supporting Information, Tables S3,
S4, and S5, respectively.

Daphnia magna
Yttrium Toxicity to D. magna
After 7 days of exposure to Y, a decrease of D.
magna relative size as a function of exposure was
observed at a hardness of 130 mg L–1 of CaCO3 (Table 1).
Indeed, a significant loss of 26% of D. magna relative size was measured at 798 μg L–1, corresponding to the LOEC of this test. With respect to mortality,
no daphnids survived an exposure to 1187 μg L–1 Y (Table 1). Both
mortality and LOECs were reached at lower exposure levels for the
tests conducted in water with lower hardness (Supporting Information, Figure S4). For example, 100% mortality
was reached for an Y exposure level of 706 μg L–1 at 90 mg L–1 of CaCO3. In addition,
a significant decrease of D. magna size
was observed from 191 μg L–1 of Y at 66 mg
L–1of CaCO3 (Supporting Information, Figure S4). The negative correlation between water
hardness and Y toxicity observed has also been reported for other
REEs from bioassays performed on Hyalella azteca,11,24Daphnia carinata,25 and Daphnia pulex.24 Depending on hardness conditions,
the LOEC for D. magna ranged from 191
to 798 μg L–1 of dissolved Y (Table 1 and Supporting Information, Figure S4). For comparison, Ma et al.26 have reported an LOEC close to 400 μg
L–1 of dissolved Ce for D. magna growth at a hardness of 252 mg L–1of CaCO3. Also, a significant mortality of D. carinata was observed by Barry and Meehan over a 6-day exposure to 39 μg
La L–1.25 Both studies
were performed in water with higher hardness than our maximal one,
130 mg L–1 of CaCO3. This could suggest
that HREEs, similar to Y, are less toxic than LREEs. This trend had
already been reported for H. azteca.11 Nonetheless, other authors measured
a positive correlation between REE toxicity and their atomic number,27 lutecium being the most toxic. Thus, further
investigations would be required to compare HREE and LREE toxicity.

# Y nominal concentration
(Y-dissolved
measurements were not performed at this exposure level). &The relative body size is the ratio of the average body size for
a given exposure concentration divided by that measured for the controls
(lowest exposure concentration). Different letters indicate a significant
difference of relative body size or Y bioaccumulation for a given
organism among Y exposure level (ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s
pairwise comparison test; p < 0.05). *The dissolved
Y concentrations over the 28-day exposure of O. mykiss are given in the Supporting Information, Table S5. Because these values showed strong variations, we also
indicate the nominal values here and use these nominal values for
the discussion.

The LOECs
measured in our study and others mentioned before are
far higher than the REE concentrations which have been measured in
aquatic ecosystems. For instance, Amyot et al.28 have reported an average concentration for the sum of REE
of 0.9 μg L–1 and 0.1 μg L–1 of Y in 14 lakes of southern Quebec (Canada). Weltje et al.9 have measured for the sum of REE dissolved concentrations
ranging from 0.003 (Lu) to 0.7 (Ce) μg L–1 in several freshwater ecosystems. Finally, in the Rhine, a river
contaminated by anthropogenic La and Gd,4 a dissolved total REE level of 0.21 μg L–1 was recorded, which is 1000 times lower than our LOEC.

Yttrium
Bioaccumulation in D. magna
With respect to bioaccumulation, with the control Y exposure
level (0.2 μg L–1) being excluded, the D. magna Y content ranged from 33 ± 21 to 45
± 66 mg Y kg–1 ww, but no trend was observed
with the exposure concentration (Table 1). This bioaccumulation is 11–141 times higher
than the ones measured for the other two organisms. Such high bioaccumulation
values for an REE in zooplankton have already been observed before
in the laboratory,29 but they are more
than 2 orders of magnitude higher than those reported on average in
the field. For instance, the mean Y concentrations in temperate28 and arctic30 freshwater
zooplankton reached 0.2 ± 0.1 and 9.2 mg kg–1 dw, respectively.

Chironomus riparius
Yttrium Toxicity to C. riparius
A significant decrease of 10–18% of C. riparius body relative size was measured as a
function of Y concentration in the sediments (Table 1). At the maximal level of Y exposure, 465
mg kg–1, the survival rate only reached 72 ±
1%, our lowest value for this bioassay (Table 1). Few studies have tested the REE toxicity
as a function of sediment concentrations, and none on chironomids.
An LOEC of 50 mg La kg–1 sediment for Caenorhabditis elegans, a value close to our LOEC
for C. riparius (53 mg kg–1 dw), was reported.31 In addition, a Microtox
test performed with sediments from Northern Quebec32 determined the IC10 value for total REE (inhibition
concentrations causing a 10% reduction in the end point) ranging from
0.45 to 48 mg kg–1.

In natural environment,
the concentrations of REEs in sediments that have already been measured
can be very close to these ecotoxicological values. Concentrations
ranging from 63 to 253 of mg kg–1 dw for Ce, the
most abundant REE, and up to 39 mg kg–1 dw for Y
in the sediments from 26 freshwater ecosystems sampled around the
world were reported.33 Also, averages of
154 ± 69 and 18 ± 6 mg kg–1 dw, of total
REE and Y, respectively, were measured in the sediments from temperate
lakes.28 However, note that the dissolved
Y concentration in water measured at our LOEC in sediment (2.2 ±
0.7 μg L–1; Supporting Information, Table S4) remained around 20 times higher than
the concentrations reported in freshwater ecosystems.28,30

Yttrium Bioaccumulation in C. riparius
Unlike D. magna, a significant
increase in Y accumulation by C. riparius was measured as a function of exposure concentrations. Yttrium accumulated
after 10 days ranged from 120 ± 34 μg kg–1 ww at the lowest exposure level to 2088 ± 209 μg kg–1 ww at the highest one (Table 1).

Bioaccumulation values close to
ours have been observed in natural freshwater ecosystems. Ranges of
total REE levels in benthic invertebrates from arctic lakes30 and temperate lakes28 of 0.22–42 (mean: 4.6 ± 12) and 0.47–37 (mean:
4.6 ± 5.7) mg kg–1 dw, respectively, were reported.
Furthermore, Y reached on average 0.61 ± 0.54 mg kg–1 dw in chironomids from temperate lakes.28 These bioaccumulation values are expressed by dw–1, whereas ours are in ww–1. To be converted in
dw, our bioaccumulation values should be at least multiplied by 4.34 However, even with this factor, they remain
close to the ones measured in natural environment.

Oncorhynchus mykiss
Yttrium Toxicity to O. mykiss
When exposed to a nominal exposure
level of 1000 μg
L–1, no trout survived more than 10 days (Table 1). Moreover, a significant
decrease in the relative body size at the end of the bioassay was
observed at 500 μg L–1 (Table 1). At this exposure level, a loss of 9 ±
4% of O. mykiss body size was determined
(Table 1).

Watson-Leung35 observed no toxic effect of La on O. mykiss exposed for 96 h up to a dissolved concentration
of 63.3 mg L–1. This threshold concentration reached
0.13 mg L–1 in a 96 h bioassay for the crimson-spotted
rainbow fish, Melanotaenia duboulayi.36 This last threshold is not far from
our LOEC, which is about 0.08 mg L–1 of dissolved
Y (Supporting Information, Table S5).

Yttrium Bioaccumulation in O. mykiss
Similar to C. riparius and
unlike D. magna, O.
mykiss bioaccumulated more Y with increasing Y exposure.
The Y levels in this organism at the end of the bioassay ranged from
0.001 ± 56 to 3.1 ± 16% mg kg–1 ww (Table 1). The exposure concentration
for this maximal value corresponds to our LOEC: 500 μg L–1.

To our knowledge, the high bioaccumulation
value of REE measured in our whole fish has never been observed in
natural freshwater ecosystems and is at least 5 times higher than
those reported on the field. For instance, among tissues from 10 freshwater
fish species from a reservoir in the state of Washington, a maximum
REE level of 0.69 mg kg–1 ww of Catostomus
catostomus including 0.057 mg kg–1 ww of Y was reported.37 Furthermore,
the ranges of 10 times lower bioaccumulation values of REE were assessed
in four freshwater fish species sold in 17 cities of China38 (from 0.034 to 0.038 mg kg–1 ww) and in 6 from Canadian temperate lakes28 (from 0.70 to 59 μg REE kg–1 dw including
0.041 to 7.4 μg Y kg–1 dw).

Yttrium Subcellular Fractionation by Species
Daphnia
magna
For all
Y exposure levels, more than 70% of Y was recovered in the NaOH-resistant
fraction of D. magna with an average
Y content of 38 ± 14 mg kg–1ww in this fraction
(Figure 1). In addition,
this fraction was the only one above our quantification limit (QL)
(0.022 ± 0.006 mg Y kg–1 ww) for our control.
The fraction containing mitochondrial membranes and lysosomes contained
6–18% of the total amount of Y (Figure 1). Overall, the Y subcellular distribution
in D. magna appears constant over our
exposure range. Note that in a complementary experiment for a short
exposure period of 24 h (Supporting Information, Figure S6), a significant decline of the proportion of Y in organelles
(mitochondrial membranes, lysosomes, and microsomes), from 21 ±
6 to 7 ± 1%, concomitantly with an increase in the NaOH-resistant
fraction, from 62 ± 13 to 88.1 ± 0.1%, was observed over
the exposure range.

Figure 1 Bioaccumulation of Y in each validated fraction of D. magna (mean ± SD; in μg kg–1 ww of the total sample; n = 3) following the exposure
level. Different letters indicate a significant difference of Y accumulation
among fractions for a given Y exposure level (ANOVA; F(5,12) = 18, 92, and 8 for exposure at 198, 396, and 795 μg
L–1, respectively; followed by Tukey’s pairwise
comparison test, p < 0.05). The absence of a letter
indicates that there is no significant difference. QL: 8 ng L–1.

The accumulation of Y
mainly in NaOH-resistant fraction, a putative
MDF, may explain why D. magna was able
to bioaccumulate Y at concentrations far higher than the two other
organisms.18 Few other studies have reported
metal fractionation in daphnids, and Y is the first metal found to
be mainly sequestered in daphnid NaOH-resistant fraction. In contrast,
around 28% of Ni39 and less than 1% of
Zn40 were found in this fraction in previous
studies. Nevertheless, an accumulation of more than 70% of a metal
in the NaOH-resistant fraction has been previously reported in other
crustaceans—U in Procambarus clarkii(41) and Pb in Gammarus fossarum(42)—but also in bivalves: Cd and
Ag in Saccostrea cucullata,43 Cr and Fe in Scrobicularia plana,44 Zn and Cu in Pyganodon
grandis,(19) and Pb in Dosinia exoleta.45

The NaOH-resistant fraction is presumed to contain organelles such
as MRG that are defined as detoxified. Nevertheless, we have strong
suspicions that it also contains debris from the chitinous exoskeleton
of D. magna. Indeed, several authors
have used a similar NaOH treatment to isolate Daphnia exoskeletons from its soft tissues.46 Also, it is well known that the REE present a strong antagonism
with Ca, which accumulates in crustacean exoskeleton in the form of
calcium carbonate.47,48 The REE can be absorbed at Ca
uptake sites and can inhibit calcium ion channels, with stronger inhibition
being reported for REE with shorter ion radius, such as Y.49 Moreover, analysis of the distribution of REEs
in crabs (Ucides cordatus) revealed
a higher accumulation in the shells50 and
has already led authors to assume a replacement of Ca during moulting.
The same assumption could be made for D. magna. It could explain why there is no apparent relationship between
exposure concentration and bioaccumulation in D. magna as well as its capacity to accumulate relatively more Y than the
other model organisms.

Several authors have reported that the
proportion of a given metal
accumulated in MDF increased with the level of exposure to that metal.51 This would suggest a progressive subcellular
detoxification of the metal in response to its level of exposure.
Although this mechanism was not observed during the 7-day exposure
to Y (Figure 1), it
was present in the 24-h exposure of D. magna to Y (Supporting Information, Figure
S6).

Even if the classification of lysosomes in either MDF or
MSF can
be debated, it is well established that mitochondria belong to the
sensitive group. Similar to Y, the mitochondrial and organelle fraction
was the MSF in which a higher relative metal proportion was found
in D. magna with 40% for Zn40 and 5 and 8% for Ni and Tl, respectively.39 It could suggest that the metal toxicity mechanism
for this crustacean, in general, is related to an interference in
its mitochondrial functions.

Chironomus
riparius
Cellular debris fraction was the
main one that bioaccumulated the
Y in C. riparius (Figure 2). From 34 to 51% of Y was
recovered in this fraction through our exposure range. Like D. magna, NaOH-resistant and mitochondrial membrane
fractions are, respectively, the first putative MDF and MSF that bioaccumulated
the Y in C. riparius cells (Figure 2). The first fraction
contained from 20 to 30% of Y and the second from 11 to 20%. Along
our exposure range, Y distribution between fractions appeared stable,
except for our maximal exposure level (465 mg kg–1 dw). Indeed, between this exposure level and the previous one (93
mg kg–1 dw), less Y was found in the cellular debris
fraction while more was found in both NaOH-resistant and the mitochondrial
membrane fractions. Y levels increased 4- and 5-folds in these latter
fractions between these two exposure levels versus only twice for
cellular debris (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Bioaccumulation of Y in each validated fraction of C. riparius (mean ± SD; in μg of Y in
the fraction per kilogram of the total wet weight of the sample; n = 3) as a function of exposure concentration. Different
letters indicate a significant difference of Y accumulation among
fractions for a given Y level exposure (ANOVA; F(5,12)
= 46, 23, 73, and 59 for exposure at 15, 53, 99, and 465 mg kg–1, respectively; followed by Tukey’s pairwise
comparison test, p < 0.05). The absence of a letter
indicates that there is no significant difference.

Strategies of Y subcellular detoxification in C.
riparius seem to differ from that of other metals
already assessed for this species. If less than 15% of Y was found
in the HDP and in the HSP fractions over our exposure range, these
two fractions appeared as the top MSF and MDF, respectively, for the
accumulation of Ni,52 Se,53 Cd,54 and Hg55 in Chironomus sp. However,
most of the Se and Ni were found in cellular debris, with more than
a third of the relative distribution in C. riparius. This fraction should therefore be considered important to understand
metal subcellular management in this species. Toxicological significance
of metal accumulation in cellular debris is not currently well defined
and most authors do not include this fraction while interpreting metal
subcellular distribution.56 Nonetheless,
others suggest that a metal-sensitive compartment integrating the
cellular debris may be more relevant.57 Furthermore, it was established that metal binding to nucleic acid
inside the nucleus (found in the debris fraction) could modify both
transcription and DNA replication and induce genotoxicity.58 Also, Huang et al.59 have reported that La, Ce, and Nd accumulated in the nuclei and
mitochondria of mice hepatocyte and induced oxidative damages. As
a result, given the large proportion of Y accumulated in cellular
debris for C. riparius at the end of
our bioassays, we must assume that Y bound to this fraction likely
contributes to its toxicological effects on this organism.

Note
that the C. riparius debris
fraction likely included its exoskeleton and the associated Y. To
reduce the contribution of Y from this tissue to Y in the debris in
future studies, the heavily chitinised head capsule of C. riparius could be removed before subcellular fractionation.

The significant accumulation of Y in the mitochondrial fraction
of C. riparius at our maximal exposure
level relative to lower exposure levels (Figure 2) is consistent with the “spillover
hypothesis” observed by many authors for other metals.19 Thus, the cell capacity to detoxify Y by accumulation
in the NaOH-resistant fraction would be exceeded at our maximal exposure
level, leading to a spillover of Y in mitochondrial membranes, an
MSF.

Oncorhynchus mykiss
Liver cells were targeted for fractionation in O.
mykiss because yttrium from water would first enter
through the gills, reach the kidney, and eventually the liver, which
is usually considered an important site of detoxification. Yttrium
in O. mykiss liver cells was mainly
present in mitochondrial membranes; this fraction represented between
34 and 39% of the total accumulated Y (Figure 3) and reached a maximal concentration of
4.0 ± 0.4 mg Y kg dw of the fraction (Supporting Information, Table S7). The remaining bioaccumulated Y was
divided between the HDP and the microsomes fractions. They contained
from 19 to 26% of Y each and accumulated statistically identical amounts
of Y. Unlike D. magna and C. riparius, in O. mykiss liver, MDF represented less than 15% of the total amount of bioaccumulated
Y. Also, there were no significant differences between the amounts
of Y bioaccumulated in the NaOH-resistant and the HSP fractions (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Bioaccumulation of Y
in each validated fraction of O. mykiss liver (mean ± SD in μg of Y
in the fraction per kilogram of the total wet weight of the sample, n = 3) as a function of exposure concentration. Different
letters indicate a significant difference of Y accumulation among
fractions for a given Y exposure level (ANOVA; F(5,12)
= 5.7 and 21 for exposure at 250 and 500 μg L–1, respectively; followed by Tukey’s pairwise comparison test, p < 0.05). The absence of a letter indicates that there
is no significant difference. QL: 8 ng L–1.

Several authors studied metal distribution inside
fish liver cells.
For instance, from 37 to 48% and from 20 to 30% of Cu was accumulated
in the organelles (mitochondria + lysosomes/microsomes) of O. mykiss liver cells60 and Cyprinus carpio liver cells61 respectively, in previous studies. Thus, as
well as Y, the organelles appear as the first putative MSF that accumulated
Cu in O. mykiss liver.60,61 In addition, the low percentage of Y accumulated in MDF fraction
was also observed for Hg in Salvelinus alpinus liver,62 and less than 15% of the accumulated
Hg was in the MDF. However, in S. alpinus liver, Hg tended to accumulate more in the HDP than in the organelles
fraction.62 Moreover, at least 30% of Cd
inside the liver cells of O. mykiss(60) and Perca flavescens(63) was found in MDF, suggesting an effective
subcellular detoxication strategy for these metals in contrast to
Y.

Comparison of Y Subcellular Detoxication between Species
For both invertebrates, considering the MDF, Y was mostly found in
the NaOH-resistant fraction. HSP was the second fraction which is
also included in the MDF and represented less than 10% of total Y
in all our organisms (Figure 4). Hence, Y binding to granules is likely the main route of
Y detoxification in cells. Racine (2016) also reached this conclusion
for REE subcellular fractionation in an alga, Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii.64 However,
further investigations to confirm this assumption will be required
in invertebrates. Also, it could be interesting to extend the analyses
to evaluate which type of granules is involved in the Y detoxification.
Indeed, Hopkin65 defined four types of
granules depending on the ligands that compose them. Considering the
Y ability to be bound with calcium-binding proteins,66 we hypothesize that Y-rich granules are most likely constituted
of calcium carbonate. Note that Hopkin65 considered that this type of granules is unlikely to be used for
metal detoxification but as resoluble temporary stores of calcium.

Figure 4 Percentage
of Y recovered in each fraction as a function of the
amount of bioaccumulated total Y in each organism: MDF, MSF, HSP,
and HDP.

Among the MSF, Y was mostly found
in mitochondria in all our organisms
(Figure 4). The interaction
of Y with mitochondrial functions could thus, at least partly, explain
the toxic effects of Y in our organisms. Gao et al.67 suggested that a way for Eu3+ and La3+ to accumulate inside plant cells was to bind to membranes of mitochondria,
chloroplasts, and cytoplasts via Ca2+ channels. Besides,
several authors have measured adverse effects which can be linked
to accumulation in mitochondria. For instance, oxidative damages on
mitochondria of mice hepatocytes following an exposure to La, Ce,
and Nd were observed.59 Moreover, a decrease
of the Ca2+-dependent basal respiration rate in rat heart
mitochondria following an exposure to Y was also observed.68

This study represents a first attempt
to compare an REE subcellular
handling between different organisms at exposure levels with measured
adverse effects. It emphasizes the importance of the NaOH fraction
and mitochondrial membrane in understanding Y detoxification and toxicity
mechanisms. It also underlines species-specific Y subcellular management
like D. magna capacity to accumulate
much higher proportion of Y in its MDF than C. riparius and O. mykiss. This study contributes
to improve our knowledge about REE risk assessment and provides first
insights into their subcellular handling.

Materials and Methods
Toxicity
Bioassays
D. magna and C. riparius were cultured in
house at the Centre d’expertise en analyse environnementale
du Québec (CEAEQ, Quebec City, QC, Canada). O. mykiss individuals were purchased from the Pisciculture
des Arpents Verts (Sainte-Edwidge, QC, Canada) and acclimated to laboratory
conditions for at least 3 weeks prior to use. A solution prepared
with a Y standard (10 000 μg/mL Y in 3% HNO3, TraceCERT, FLUKA) was used to spike the water and the sediment.
The exposure range for each bioassay was not chosen to approximate
the environmental concentrations reported to date for Y but to include
concentrations with and without observed effects.

Unless otherwise
mentioned, all exposure concentrations were determined as described
in the section “Yttrium Measurements and
Quality Control”. Detailed descriptions of each bioassay
are given in the Supporting Information. Also, monitoring of Y dissolved in the exposure media are presented
in Tables S3–S5, respectively, for D. magna, C. riparius, and O. mykiss and Y speciation at
the beginning of each test is presented in the Supporting Information, Table S6. Briefly, the initial exposure
solution pH and hardness comprised between 7.4–7.9 and 45–130
mg L–1 of CaCO3. No organic ligands were
added and, in these conditions, Y was mainly present in the form of
YCO3+ (61–80%) and Y(CO3)2– (8–36%).

Daphnia
magna
A 7-day D. magna growth test was performed in semistatic
conditions (water renewed daily) at a hardness of 130 mg L–1 of CaCO3 and a pH of 7.9. The reconstituted water and
the adjustment of its hardness were made according to USEPA protocols21 (Supporting Information, Table S1). D. magna neonates (<24
h) were exposed individually (one individual per experimental unit,
10 experimental unit per treatment) in reconstituted water at five
nominal Y concentrations (0, 200, 400, 800, and 1200 μg L–1) with 10 replicates per treatment. Additional experiments
at 66 and 90 mg CaCO3 L–1 were also performed.

Chironomus riparius
A 10-day
sediment growth test with a sediment collected from Lac
Croche at the Station de biologie des Laurentides (QC, Canada), spiked
with Y (52, 144, and 450 mg kg–1 dry weight, dw),
was carried out with C. riparius as
described elsewhere.22C.
riparius were exposed by groups of 30 individuals
with 3 replicates per treatment. Hardness and pH in the water medium
were set at 45 mg L–1 of CaCO3 and 7.5,
respectively. Details of the preparation of the Y-spiked sediment
and of the characteristics of the natural sediment are given in the Supporting Information.

Oncorhynchus
mykiss
A 28-day growth test with five Y concentrations
(0, 250, 500, 1000,
and 2000 μg L–1) was conducted with O. mykiss according to the international standard
ISO 1022923 with some modifications. For
each concentration tested, 10 individuals of O. mykiss were exposed in 20 L of Y-spiked reconstituted water (Supporting Information, Table S1), in semistatic
conditions, 80% of the test water being renewed every 48 h. The water
hardness was set at 45 mg L–1 of CaCO3 and pH at 7.7. Trout were fed twice daily at a rate of 2% of body
weight per day with a commercial feed (see the Supporting Information for details). Fish consumed all the
food provided in less than 1 min during our experiments, so it is
unlikely that dietary uptake was significant. Further, we measured
Y in the food before exposure and it contained low concentrations
of Y that were not comparable with the high concentration of Y administered
through aqueous exposure.

Subcellular Fractionation
Protocol
Each organism was
rinsed with a 1 mM EDTA solution to remove the Y adsorbed to the surface
of its body before sampling for subcellular fractionation. Samples
of each organism were partitioned into six subcellular fractions with
the fractionation protocol developed by Wallace et al. customized
for our three species.15,16 Figure S1 in the Supporting Information presents the fractionation
protocol with the customization applied for each species. In a previous
publication, we validated the location of mitochondria (membrane and
matrix), lysosomes, and cytosol between fractions (Supporting Information, Figure S1) by performing enzymatic
biomarker assays on the separated fractions.16 Thus, a distinction is made between these validated fractions and
those predicted from the literature for which, to our knowledge, no
relevant method of validation has been developed so far. These predicted
fractions are the cellular debris (e.g., nuclei and membranes), the
NaOH-resistant fraction, microsomes, the HDP, and the HSP.

Briefly,
for each organism, 60–100 mg of tissue (whole organism: D. magna, C. riparius; liver: O. mykiss) was sampled and
suspended in Tris-HCl (25 mM; OmniPur) and sucrose buffer (250 mM;
pH 7.4; Sigma-Aldrich) at a final ratio of 1:8 (weight [mg]: buffer
volume [μL]). Samples were homogenized on a motorized Potter-Elvehjem
homogenizer equipped with a Teflon pestle at 570 rpm (Fisher Scientific)
and, except for C. riparius, were sonicated
(22 W, 20%) (Branson 250, with a 4.8 mm diameter microtip probe) over
a second homogenization step. After each homogenization, an aliquot
of 40 μL was collected for estimating the total Y burden of
the sample and the rest was centrifuged at 800–1500g for 15 min at 4 °C to separate the debris fraction
from the other fractions (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The resulting supernatant was collected and subjected
to a second centrifugation step at 15 000–25 000g for 30 min at 4 °C (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The mitochondrial pellet was then
isolated, and an ultracentrifugation step was performed on the remaining
supernatant at 100 000–190 000g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was separated from the supernatant
at this step (Supporting Information, Figure
S1). This supernatant was heated at 80 °C for 10 min, cooled
for 1 h at 4 °C, and finally centrifuged at 50 000g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate the HSP from the HDP.
To separate cellular debris from the NaOH-resistant fraction, the
debris fraction was filled with 500 μL of Milli-Q water and
vortexed. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 2 min, then 500
μL of NaOH 1 N (99.998%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and the temperature
was set at 80 °C for 1 h. Finally, the suspension was centrifuged
at 10 000g for 10 min at 20 °C (Supporting Information, Figure S1).

Because
of the presence of a cuticular exoskeleton, arthropods
were more difficult to be homogenized and fractionated than O. mykiss liver. The accumulation of Y in the debris
fraction, which likely collects this exoskeleton and can be a significant
site of metal accumulation, must therefore be considered with caution.

Yttrium Measurements and Quality Control
To minimize
Y accidental contamination, all labware was soaked in HNO3 (15%, v/v, Optima grade, Fisher Scientific) and rinsed seven times
in Milli-Q water before use.

Centrifuged pellet fractions resulting
from the subcellular partitioning (NaOH-resistant fraction, mitochondrial
membranes, microsomes, and HDP), aliquots sampled as homogenate, and O. mykiss remaining parts were freeze-dried for 24
h, weighed, and stored at −80 °C. The freeze-dried fractions
and the two other ones (debris and HSP) were digested at 65 °C
in 500 μL of HNO3 (70%, v/v), whereas O. mykiss body remaining parts, representing heavier
mass, were subjected to the same procedure but in 4 mL of HNO3. Then, 9.5 and 45 mL of Milli-Q water were added in the digestates
of subcellular fractions and body remaining parts, respectively.

Concentrations of Y in subcellular fractions, homogenates, water,
and sediments were measured with an inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectrometer (Thermo Elemental X Series). To ensure the quality of
these measurements, samples of similar weight of a certified standard
reference material, BCR 668 (mussel tissue, Institute for Reference
Materials and Measurements), underwent the same digestion procedure
and analysis. Mean [±standard deviation (SD)] recoveries of BCR
668 reference sample (n = 9) were within the certified
range for Y (103 ± 10%). For sediments, the method detection
limit was 2 ng kg–1, and for water, it was 3 ng
L–1. The homogenate (40 μL) sampled over the
fractionation procedure was analyzed to confirm metal recovery following
subcellular fractionation. Recoveries were expressed as the ratio
of the sum of the Y burden in the six fractions divided by the total
sample Y burden assessed from the 40 μL of the homogenate, multiplied
by 100. The mean (±SD) recovery values of Y were 90 ± 11%
(n = 12) for D. magna, 70.0 ± 0.1% (n = 12) for C.
riparius, and 87 ± 22% (n =
9) for O. mykiss. Note that it was
assumed by Cardon et al.16 that around
25% of C. riparius samples were probably
not efficiently homogenized with the subcellular fractionation procedure
performed on this species. It could explain why we obtained lower
recovery values for C. riparius.

Calculation and Statistical Analysis
To assess the
effect of Y on growth, the relative size of animals was calculated
as the size of the organism for a given Y exposure level divided by
the mean size of the controls.

Yttrium concentrations in every
subcellular fraction were expressed as the Y burden in the fraction
divided by the total sample wet weight (ww) (mg kg–1 ww). The yttrium burden in a given fraction was divided by the sum
of Y burden in all fractions and multiplied by 100 to assess the relative
contribution of each subcellular fraction to the total Y burden in
terms of percentages (%).

Data are expressed as means ±
coefficient of variation (CV)
for Y total bioaccumulation and relative organism size, and as mean
± SD for Y exposure measurements and Y bioaccumulation in fractions.
Significant differences of organism size at the end of the bioassays
or of Y burden in a given fraction/organism between Y exposure levels
were tested with analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s
pairwise comparison test (p < 0.05). The assumptions
of normality and homoscedasticity were verified by Shapiro–Wilk’s
and Levene’s tests, respectively. Statistical analyses were
performed using R software version 3.4.4.
