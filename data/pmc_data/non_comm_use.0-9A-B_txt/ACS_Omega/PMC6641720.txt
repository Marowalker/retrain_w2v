Despite their unique
advantages, the full potential of molecular
probes for fluorescent monitoring of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates
has not been fully exploited. This limited utility stems from the
lack of knowledge about the hydrophobic interactions between the molecules
of Aβ probes, as well as those between the probe and the Aβ
aggregate. Herein, we report the first mechanistic study, which firmly
establishes a structure–signaling relationship of fluorescent
Aβ probes. We synthesized a series of five fluorescent Aβ
probes based on an archetypal donor–acceptor–donor scaffold
(denoted as SN1–SN5). The arylamino
donor moieties were systematically varied to identify molecular factors
that could influence the interactions between molecules of each probe
and that could influence their fluorescence outcomes in conditions
mimicking the biological milieu. Our probes displayed different responses
to aggregates of Aβ, Aβ40 and Aβ42, two major isoforms found in Alzheimer’s disease: SN2, having pyrrolidine donors, showed noticeable ratiometric
fluorescence responses (Δν = 797 cm–1) to the Aβ40 and Aβ42 samples
that contained oligomeric species, whereas SN4, having N-methylpiperazine donors, produced significant fluorescence
turn-on signaling in response to Aβ aggregates, including oligomers,
protofibrils, and fibrils (with turn-on ratios of 14 and 10 for Aβ42 and Aβ40, respectively). Mechanistic investigations
were carried out by performing field-emission scanning electron microscopy,
X-ray crystallography, UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, and
steady-state and transient photoluminescence spectroscopy experiments.
The studies revealed that the SN probes underwent preassembly
prior to interacting with the Aβ species and that the preassembled
structures depended profoundly on the subtle differences between the
amino moieties of the different probes. Importantly, the studies demonstrated
that the mode of fluorescence signaling (i.e., ratiometric response
versus turn-on response) was primarily governed by stacking geometries
within the probe preassemblies. Specifically, ratiometric fluorescence
responses were observed for probes capable of forming J-assembly,
whereas fluorescence turn-on responses were obtained for probes incapable
of forming J-aggregates. This finding provides an important guideline
to follow in future efforts at developing fluorescent probes for Aβ
aggregation. We also conclude, on the basis of our study, that the
rational design of such fluorescent probes should consider interactions
between the probe molecules, as well as those between Aβ peptides
and the probe molecule.

Introduction
Amyloid-β
(Aβ) aggregates are assembled superstructures
of misfolded Aβ peptides.1,2 The genesis and progress
of Aβ aggregation are characterized by dynamic changes in the
heterogenic population of different forms of Aβ, including monomers,
low- and high-molecular-weight oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils.3−9 A growing amount of evidence has indicated that different individual
species of Aβ aggregates have different effects on the pathology
of Alzheimer’s diseases (AD).8,10−19 To understand the detailed role of Aβ aggregates in AD pathogenesis,
chemical tools capable of detecting Aβ aggregation have been
developed and employed.20−28

Among the available chemical tools, fluorescent probes are
the
most suitable for monitoring Aβ species with respect to sensitivity,
dynamic ranges, and ability for real-time imaging. Various fluorescent
probes have been designed on the basis of the structures of traditional
stains for Aβ fibrils, such as thioflavin-T (ThT).2,29,30 Several molecular strategies
have been employed to shift emission wavelengths bathochromically,
with these strategies having included extending π-conjugated
backbones,31−38 and introducing an electron donor (D) and an electron acceptor (A)
at each terminus of a π-conjugated framework.24,39−70 These designs entailed enhancing the lipophilicity of probes, which
could be beneficial for increasing their affinity for hydrophobic
Aβ aggregates and their ability to cross the blood–brain
barrier.41,53

Increasing the lipophilicity of a
probe may, however, result in
the spontaneous aggregation of the probe molecules in aqueous media.
Actually, this cohesion is unavoidable for the majority of fluorescent
probes because they are based on rigid, planar π-scaffolds,
such as polyenes or fused aromatics.26−28 The self-association
of probe molecules makes it difficult to predict and to interpret
the fluorescence response to Aβ aggregates, posing significant
challenges in the rational design of Aβ probes. This notion
is supported by previous observations with the enhancement or quenching
of fluorescence emission attributed to subtle differences between
the structures of the self-associated and monomeric probe molecules.71,72 Note that previous research has mainly focused on binding interactions
of probe molecules with hydrophobic clefts of Aβ proteins but
has mostly ignored the multitude of other intermolecular interactions
present in various ensembles of probes and Aβ peptides. The
resulting limited knowledge has impeded the exploitation of the full
potential of fluorescent probes for monitoring Aβ aggregation.

Herein, we report the association and Aβ detection properties
of a novel series of D–A–D fluorophores, denoted as SN1–SN5, with demonstration of molecular
level mechanisms for their fluorescence responses to Aβ aggregation.
The fluorophores consisted of p-(N,N-disubstituted amino)styryl donors and a pyrone
acceptor (Figure 1).
Fluorescence responses of the SN compounds to aggregation
processes of two major isoforms of Aβ, Aβ40 and Aβ42,5 were monitored.
By carrying out photophysical and X-ray crystallographic experiments,
we found SN1 and SN2 to spontaneously organize
into slipped J-stacks in buffered aqueous solutions. Further mechanistic
studies of these fluorophores, including studies involving steady-state
and transient photophysical measurements, were performed to elucidate
the molecular origin of their fluorescence responses to Aβ aggregates.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Fluorescence Studies of the
Molecular Probes for
Aβ Aggregation
The molecular constructs of the SN compounds were based on a bent D–A–D scaffold.
This design was chosen because the presence of a permanent dipole
moment in such a scaffold can bolster molecular stacking. Five SN compounds (SN1–SN5) were
prepared, each through a condensation reaction between pyrone and
a p-aminobenzaldehyde in the presence of sodium ethoxide.
Structures of the p-amino entities were varied and
included N,N-dimethylamine (SN1), pyrrolidine (SN2), N,N-diphenylamine (SN3), N-methylpiperazine
(SN4), and morpholine (SN5). Synthetic details
and spectroscopic identification data of the SN compounds
are summarized in the Supporting Information (SI, Figures S1–S10). The SN compounds displayed
yellow to orange fluorescence when dissolved in organic solutions.
For instance, SN2 was observed to be moderately fluorescent
in CH3CN, with an emission peak wavelength (λem) of 559 nm and a fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) of 0.011. Photophysical data for the SN compounds
are compiled in Table 1.

The ability to use the SN compounds for fluorescence
monitoring of Aβ aggregation was investigated by employing Aβ42 and Aβ40, two major Aβ isoforms found
in the AD-affected brain (Figures 2 and 3, and SI, Figures S11–S13).5,7,74 The generation of both Aβ42 and Aβ40 aggregates was tracked using the ThT assay,
dot blot assay, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Figures 2a–c and 3a–c). In the case of Aβ42, a rapid onset of the elongation phase of aggregation occurred (Figure 2a), whereas the aggregation
of Aβ40 exhibited a slightly longer lag phase (Figure 3a). In addition,
the dot blot assay using two different anti-Aβ antibodies (i.e.,
6E10 for Aβ species7,75 and A11 for structured
oligomers76) indicated the formation of
A11-detectable structured oligomers after 2 and 1.5 h incubation of
Aβ42 and Aβ40, respectively (Figures 2b and 3b). The morphologies of Aβ aggregates obtained from
different incubation time points were also monitored through TEM (Figures 2c and 3c). Fibrilization of both Aβ42 and Aβ40 was identified at longer incubation time (10 and 24 h).
The distinct aggregation characteristics of Aβ42 and
Aβ40 observed through three different methods were
consistent with the results reported previously.5,13,77,78 Note that
we applied the Aβ species generated upon aggregation to our
probes because the isolation of specific Aβ species is difficult
due to multiple aggregation pathways and sensitivity on experimental
conditions for forming Aβ aggregates.8

[Aβ40] = 20 μM; [SN2 or SN4] = 2 μM; pH 7.4; λex = 399 and

We measured the fluorescence responses
of SN1–SN5 to the aggregation of
Aβ42 and Aβ40 (10 equiv). The fluorescence
spectra of both SN2 and SN4 were observed
to be considerably affected by
the progress of Aβ aggregation (Figures 2d,e and 3d,e), whereas SN1, SN3, and SN5 did not produce
such responses (SI, Figure S11). When Aβ
aggregates were treated with SN2 and SN4 followed by being imaged using a confocal microscope, noticeable
fluorescence signals were observed, indicative of the interaction
between Aβ aggregates and our probes (SI, Figure S12). In particular, ratiometric fluorescence monitoring
of Aβ aggregation was found to be possible when using SN2 as the fluorescence probe: (i) SN2 yielded
a hypsochromic shift (λem = 618 → 588 nm),
along with a 3.6-fold enhancement in the fluorescence intensity, upon
interacting with Aβ42 species that were pre-incubated
for 4 h (Figure 2d,
left); and (ii) the fluorescence intensity decreased with a small
bathochromic shift (λem = 588 → 600 nm), when SN2 was treated with Aβ42 species preincubated
for 6, 10, and 24 h (Figure 2d, middle). Similar ratiometric fluorescence responses to
Aβ40 were also observed. As depicted in Figure 3d, SN2 showed the most enhanced (2.6-fold) and blue-shifted (λem = 618 → 589 nm) fluorescence emission in the presence
of the Aβ40 species preincubated for 5 h. In contrast,
fluorescence turn-off responses with a bathochromic shift (λem = 589 → 600 nm) were observed in the presence of
Aβ40 aggregates generated by longer durations of
incubation (i.e., 24 h). For both Aβ42 and Aβ40, the turn-on ratiometric fluorescence responses of SN2 were found to be more discernible when treated with the
Aβ samples that contained oligomeric aggregates than those mainly
having monomers and fibrils (Figures 2d and 3d). Such specificity
for oligomers could have resulted from greater hydrophobic interactions,
because, compared to mature fibrils, oligomeric species have been
suggested to have more exposed hydrophobic groups.79−82 The detailed mechanisms of the
fluorescence responses are discussed in the following section (vide
infra).

In the case of SN4, fluorescence turn-on
responses
were observed upon interactions of this probe with Aβ42 and Aβ40 species. As shown in Figures 2e and 3e, the fluorescence responses of SN4 were characterized
by monotonic increases in intensities in proportion to the preincubation
time of the Aβ peptide. Maximum turn-on ratios for Aβ42 and Aβ40 were measured to be 14 and 10,
respectively, and the responses were devoid of noticeable chromic
shifts. SN4 preferentially interacted with Aβ aggregates
(e.g., larger Aβ aggregates, including protofibrils and fibrils,
especially for Aβ40) over Aβ monomers. Note
that the fluorescence responses of both SN2 and SN4 to Aβ42 were observed to be distinct
from those to Aβ40. Compared to Aβ40, Aβ42 was found to elicit a greater change in fluorescence
at shorter preincubation times. Such specificity could have resulted
from the different structural and aggregation properties of Aβ42 relative to Aβ40: Aβ42 tends to aggregate faster than Aβ40, producing
a diverse range of oligomers, including dodecamers.5,77,78

Furthermore, SN2 and SN4 produced no
noticeable response to ubiquitin, a competing protein, whereas SN1, SN3, and SN5 did slightly respond
to ubiquitin (SI, Figure S14). Both SN2 and SN4 could detect Aβ species in
a mixture of Aβ aggregates (20 μM) and ubiquitin (20 μM;
SI, Figure S15). Moreover, when SN2 and SN4 were added to the solutions containing 5 and
10 h preincubated Aβ aggregates and neuro-2a neuroblastoma (N2a)
APPwt cell lysates that included various proteins, both compounds
presented their fluorescent responses to Aβ species (SI, Figure S15). Taken together, the fluorescence
experiments with Aβ demonstrated the feasibility of using SN2 and SN4 to monitor Aβ aggregation.
The fluorescent responses to the Aβ species depended distinctively
on the molecular structures of the probes; SN2 showed
ratiometric fluorescence changes, whereas SN4 produced
fluorescence turn-on responses. Moreover, both SN2 and SN4 (2 μM) were not shown to be toxic in living cells
for a short incubation time (i.e., 1 h); however, with longer incubation
(24 h), SN4 noticeably indicated cytotoxicity (SI, Figure S16).

Molecular Origin for the
Fluorescence Responses to Aβ
Aggregation
We hypothesized the contrasting responses of
the SN probes to Aβ aggregates to be due to different
preassociation structures formed by the probes. To validate this hypothesis,
we investigated the photophysical properties of all of the SN compounds in aqueous solutions. As shown in Figure 4, an enhancement in fluorescence was observed
for SN2 upon the addition of H2O into the
CH3CN solution. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) experiments revealed the formation
of globular nanoparticles of SN2 (Figure 4a,b). The nanoparticle suspension was found
to be very stable, as neither particle agglomeration nor precipitation
was observed within 3 days of preparation. An enhancement in Φf by 1 order of magnitude was observed upon nanoparticle formation
(Φf = 0.12 in 1:19 v/v CH3CN/H2O; λem = 599 nm; Table 2). This increase was accompanied by a nearly
1 order of magnitude increase in the fluorescence lifetime (τobs) of SN2, from 0.31 ns (CH3CN) to
1.1 ns (1:19 v/v CH3CN/H2O), and by an increase
and a decrease, respectively, of the corresponding radiative rate
constant (kr, kr = Φf/τobs) and nonradiative rate
constant (knr, knr = (1 – Φf)/τobs; kr, 3.6 × 107 to 1.1
× 108 s–1; knr, 3.21 × 109 to 8.0 × 108 s–1; Tables 1 and 2). The results suggested
that the fluorescence enhancement was due to the system operating
under both radiative and nonradiative control. Upon forming nanoparticles, SN2 showed bathochromic shifts in its UV–vis absorption
(by 2560 cm–1) and fluorescence (by 1190 cm–1; Figures 4d,e). These spectroscopic signatures were indicative of J-assembly
formation, which involved slipped unidirectional arrangement of SN2 (vide infra). J-assemblies are beneficial for luminescence
applications as they exhibit strong fluorescence emission due to high
allowance for radiative transition.71 Such
J-emission was retained in an aqueous solution buffered at pH 7.4
(25 mM piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic
acid) (PIPES), 100 mM KCl), demonstrating that the amphiphilic buffer
molecules (i.e., PIPES) did not interfere with the SN2 assembly (SI, Figure S17).

The J-assembly depended on subtle
differences in the structures
of the amino entities in the SN compounds: SN1 was found to display J-fluorescence emission similar to that of SN2, whereas the other tested molecules (i.e., SN3, SN4, and SN5) did not produce such behaviors
(see Figure 4c). The
UV–vis absorption and fluorescence spectral measurements revealed
the presence of a J-transition in the SN1 nanoparticles,
whereas such a behavior was absent for SN3, SN4, and SN5 (SI, Figure S18). The inability of SN3 to participate in J-assembly
formation was likely due to increased steric hindrance by N,N-diphenylamino groups, and the inability
for SN4 and SN5 was ascribed to the presence
of additional basic atoms. On the basis of the results taken together,
the SN compounds are classified into two groups: (i)
those forming highly fluorescent J-assembly, i.e., SN1 and SN2; and (ii) those not forming J-assembly, i.e., SN3, SN4, and SN5. The photophysical
parameters of the aggregates of the SN compounds are
summarized in Table 2.

To investigate the structural origin
of the J-fluorescence of SN1 and SN2, we
obtained single crystals of SN1. Several attempts to
grow the crystals of SN2 suitable for X-ray crystallographic
analysis were unsuccessful.
As shown in Figure 5a, SN1 adopts a near planar structure having distortion
angles between the pyrone core and two phenyl rings to be 8.00 and
3.72°. The molecular stacking structure reveals the presence
of short intermolecular contacts of 2.960 and 3.843 Å, which
correspond to C–H···π and π–π
interactions, respectively. Geometric parameters for the crystal of SN1 are piled in SI, Tables S1 and S2. The overall stacking geometry of SN1 was characterized
by a zigzag alignment, where dipolar interactions between the two p-(N,N-dimethylamino)styrylpyrone
entities provided a key driving force. In this molecular arrangement,
transition dipole moments were calculated using the time-dependent
density functional theory method and found to be oriented at an angle
of 15.2° relative to the stacking axis (Figure 5b, bottom). This angular alignment met the
requirement for J-type exciton coupling (i.e., <54.7°), providing
compelling evidence for J-assembly formation. In particular, note
that the single crystal of SN1 yielded a fluorescence
spectrum and Kubelka–Munk function (F(R)) displaying peak wavelengths essentially identical to
those obtained for the nanoparticle suspension (1:19 v/v CH3CN/H2O; SI, Figure S19). This
identity supported the claim that J-assembled nanoparticle formation
was responsible for the enhanced fluorescence emission with the large
bathochromic shifts. Taken together, the photophysical and structural
results revealed the preassociation of SN1 and SN2 into J-assemblies prior to their interactions with Aβ
species. In contrast, the other SN compounds did not
form such J-assemblies in their preassociation states.

To elucidate a mechanism for the fluorescence responses of SN2 and SN4 to Aβ species, we performed
morphological and spectroscopic investigations of the assemblies of SN2 and SN4 in the absence and presence of Aβ
species. We examined whether the probe particles would disaggregate
upon interacting with the hydrophobic Aβ species, which has
been proposed in previous studies.19,60 As shown in Figure 6a, SN2 nanoparticles (2 μM in buffered aqueous solutions containing
20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) yielded
UV–vis absorption spectra displaying no discernable change
after a 10 min incubation with Aβ42 aggregates that
had been pre-incubated for 4 h. Longer incubation of SN2 nanoparticles with Aβ42 aggregates for a period
of a week did not lead to disassembly of the SN2 J-nanoparticles,
as revealed by the retention of the J-absorption band (SI, Figure S20). In addition, globular probe particles
were found in the TEM images of SN2 and SN4, each in the presence of Aβ42 aggregates (SI, Figure S21). These results indicated that the
nanoparticle structures of the probes were retained upon their interaction
with Aβ aggregates. Furthermore, no detectable difference of
forming Aβ aggregates in the absence and presence of SN2 or SN4 was indicated by TEM and the dot blot assay
(SI, Figures S22–S24), revealing
that the SN probes did not interfere with Aβ aggregation.
These results taken together indicated that the fluorescence responses
of SN2 and SN4 to Aβ species were
due to neither disaggregation of the probe J-assemblies nor probe-induced
changes in the aggregation of Aβ and Aβ aggregates’
morphology.

(red) and presence (blue) of 100 mM CTAB. (f) The Lippert–Mataga

To gain insight into photophysical
aspects of the mechanism of
the fluorescence responses of SN2 to Aβ species,
fluorescence decay traces of SN2 nanoparticles (2 μM)
were acquired employing time-correlated single-photon counting techniques
before and after incubation with Aβ42 aggregates
in a buffered aqueous solution (pH 7.4, 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl).
An increase in τobs upon the interaction of the SN2 nanoparticles with the Aβ aggregates was evident,
as shown in Figure 6b. Specifically, τobs increased from 0.84 ns in
the absence of the Aβ42 aggregates to 1.32 ns after
a 10 min incubation with the Aβ42 aggregates. Also,
the values of kr and knr correspondingly decreased, with a greater change observed
for knr (Figure 6c). The greater decrease in knr enabled us to propose that Aβ species impeded
nonradiative transitions of the probe nanoparticles. Similar behaviors
were also observed for SN4 (SI, Figure S25), corroborating this hypothesis.

To provide additional
evidence for this hypothesis, we obtained
fluorescence spectra of SN2 and SN4 with
the addition of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), an amphiphilic
surfactant, to form a hydrophobic layer shielding against fluorescence
quenchers, such as water. This protective role of CTAB was expected
to mimic the interaction with Aβ species. As expected, the addition
of 100 mM CTAB into an aqueous solution of SN2 nanoparticles
evoked a ratiometric fluorescence response, similar to that observed
for Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Figure 6d). Likewise, CTAB elicited
a fluorescence turn-on of the SN4 nanoparticles (Figure 6e). These results
supported the idea that the fluorescence responses of SN2 and SN4 to Aβ species were due to abolition of
deleterious quenching at the nanoparticle surface. An additional effect
of the surface shielding was a hypsochromic shift of the fluorescence
emission of the J-assemblies of SN2 (Figure 6d). The chromic shift can be
explained on the basis of hydrophobic interactions. The large positive
solvatochromism of SN2 corroborated this explanation
(Figure 6f).

On the basis of the morphological and photophysical
results, we
devised a plausible mechanism for the fluorescence responses of SN2 and SN4 (Figure 7). According to this mechanism, the SN2 molecules spontaneously formed J-assembled nanoparticles
in the aqueous solutions. Although J-type exciton coupling enhanced
the fluorescence intensities, emission quenching at the surface of
the J-assemblies was still present, facilitating nonradiative deactivation.
Aβ species effectively protected the surface against the nonradiative
processes, producing turn-on fluorescence responses. In addition,
the hydrophobic environment provided by the Aβ species induced
a hypsochromic shift in the fluorescence emission. In the case of SN4, the probe did not self-organize into ordered molecular
assemblies. The absence of J-assemblies resulted in fluorescence quenching
of SN4 nanoparticles, which is typically observed for
organic molecules. Nonetheless, hydrophobic interactions of the SN4 nanoparticles with Aβ aggregates turned on fluorescence
emission to a considerable extent, an effect similar to that of SN2.

fluorescence
responses of the SN2 (top) and SN4 (bottom)
nanoassemblies to Aβ species.

Summary and Conclusions
Prior to the current work,
intermolecular interactions of lipophilic
probes for Aβ species and the fluorescence outcomes of these
interactions had not yet been studied because such studies were a
significant challenge. Herein, we investigated preassociation behaviors
of a series of D–A–D molecules (SN compounds)
and utilized the preassemblies for monitoring Aβ aggregation.
Of the five SN compounds investigated, SN1 and SN2 spontaneously formed highly fluorescent J-assembled
nanoparticles in a buffered solution. Spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic
investigations specifically revealed the formation of intermolecular
J-stacks. We successfully demonstrated the visualization of Aβ
aggregation processes, employing J-type assemblies of SN2 and non-J-type aggregates of SN4, which produced ratiometric
and turn-on fluorescence signals, respectively. This example of the
ratiometric fluorescence assay of Aβ aggregation using J-assembled
nanoparticles is the first example, to the best of our knowledge.
Photophysical and TEM investigations indicated that the probe nanoparticles
did not undergo disaggregation upon interactions with Aβ species.
Transient photophysical measurements provided evidence that hydrophobic
interactions with Aβ species abolished fluorescence quenching
at the particle surface. Experiments using a CTAB surfactant, an Aβ
aggregate mimic, supported this notion. Overall, our studies provide
a promising alternative to monitor Aβ aggregation pathways.

Methods
Materials and General Methods

Merck KGaA) and by adjusting the pH to 7.4 with standard KOH (45 wt
%, Sigma-Aldrich) and HCl (1 N, Fluka) solutions. KCl (100 mM) and
NaCl (150 mM) were included in the PIPES and HEPES solutions, respectively,
to simulate the ionic strength of the biological milieu. Trace metal
contamination was removed from buffers and solutions used for the
experiments with peptides by treating the buffers and solutions with
Chelex (Sigma-Aldrich). Aβ40 (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVV)

X-ray Crystallography
Crystals suitable
for X-ray crystallography
were obtained by performing a slow diffusion of hexane onto a dichloromethane
solution of 0.15 M SN1. Single crystals of SN1 were picked from the solution with a nylon loop (Hampton Research
Co.) at room temperature and mounted on a goniometer head in an N2 cryostream. Data from a single SN1 crystal were
collected using a Bruker, SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer equipped
with a monochromator for an Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å)
beam. The charge-coupled device data were integrated and scaled using
the Bruker-SAINT software package, and the structure was solved and
refined with SHEXTL V 6.12. Hydrogen atoms were placed on the calculated
positions. Nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal
parameters. Crystal data for SN1: C25H26N2O2, monoclinic, P21/n, Z = 4, a = 7.8531(5), b = 7.4811(4), c = 34.767(2) Å, β = 91.880(3)°, V = 2041.5(2) Å3, μ = 0.080 mm–1, ρcalcd = 1.257 g cm–3, R1 = 0.0800, wR2 = 0.1275 for 4023 unique reflections, 267 variables.
These crystallographic data for SN1 are also summarized
in SI, Table S1, and Table S2 in the SI lists the selected bond distances and angles.
CCDC 1558038 for SN1 contains the supporting crystallographic
data for this paper.

Preparation of Nanoparticles of SN1–SN5
A nanoparticle suspension of each SN compound was prepared by slowly adding Milli-Q grade water
into
a vigorously stirred CH3CN solution containing the SN compound until the total volume of the mixture reached
10 mL. The final concentration of the SN compound was
10 μM. The stirred solution became cloudy when the water volume
fraction exceeded 90 vol %. Typically, water volume fractions of greater
than 97.5% were prepared for spectroscopic measurements.

Preparation
of Aβ Aggregates and Ubiquitin
Aβ
peptides were dissolved in hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) and sonicated
for 30 min. After removal of HFIP, the Aβ peptides were redissolved
in NH4OH (1% w/v, aq; 10 μL) and then diluted in
doubly distilled water (ddH2O). The concentration of Aβ
was determined by measuring the absorbance of the solution at 280
nm (ε = 1450 M–1 cm–1 for
Aβ40; ε = 1490 M–1 cm–1 for Aβ42). A buffered solution (20
mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) was used to prepare the Aβ samples.
The Aβ samples (20 μM) were incubated at 37 °C for
various durations with constant agitation. The ubiquitin peptide was
prepared by dissolving it in ddH2O. The concentration of
ubiquitin was determined by measuring the absorbance of the solution
at 280 nm (ε = 1280 M–1 cm–1). The ubiquitin solution was diluted to 20 μM with the buffered
solution (i.e., 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl).

Steady-State
Photoluminescence Measurements
Photoluminescence
spectra were obtained using a Photon Technology International, Quanta
Master 400 scanning spectrofluorometer at room temperature (CH3CN) or at 37 °C (buffered solutions). The temperature
was maintained by employing a water circulator. The 10 μM solutions
were used for the measurements, otherwise mentioned. Excitation wavelengths
were 417 nm (SN1), 399 nm (SN2), 409 nm
(SN3), 404 nm (SN4), and 396 nm (SN5). The fluorescence quantum yields (Φfs) were relatively
determined according to the following equation: Φf = Φf,ref × (I/Iref) × (Aref/A) × (n/nref)2, where A, I, and n are the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, integrated
photoluminescence intensity, and the refractive index of the solvent,
respectively. 9,10-Diphenylanthracene in toluene was used as the external
reference (Φf,ref = 1.00).73

Fluorescence Lifetime Measurements
Solutions (2 or
10 μM) in Ar-saturated CH3CN or buffered solutions
were used for determination of the fluorescence lifetime (τobs). Photoluminescence decay traces were acquired on the basis
of the time-correlated single-photon counting techniques using a PicoQuant,
FluoTime 200 instrument after picosecond pulsed laser excitation.
A 377 nm diode laser (PicoQuant) was used as the excitation source.
The photoluminescence signals at the emission peak wavelengths were
obtained through an automated motorized monochromator. Photoluminescence
decay profiles were analyzed (OriginPro 8.0, OriginLab) using single-
or double-exponential decay models. In the case of biphasic decays,
τobs values were calculated from the relationship
τobs = ∑Aiτi2/∑Aiτi (i = 1–2),
where Ai and τi are the preexponential factor and the time constant, respectively.

Dynamic Light Scattering Experiments
Distributions
of particle diameters of 10 μM nanoparticle suspensions were
determined through dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments using
a Photal Otsuka Electronics, ELS-Z1000 instrument at room temperature.
Data analyses were performed by employing the software provided by
the manufacturer.

Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope
Experiments
An aliquot of 10 μM nanoparticle suspensions
was placed on
a 1 cm × 1 cm glass substrate and dried under dark. The field-emission
scanning electron microscope images of the nanoparticles were obtained
using a Carl Zeiss, SUPRA 55VP equipment after platinum coating (120
s) using a Leica, EM ACE200.

Determination of the Partition Coefficient
(clog P)
The same volumes of n-octanol
and a buffered solution (10 mM PBS, pH 7.4) were stirred for 24 h
and transferred into a separatory funnel for complete phase separation
at room temperature (presaturation process). SN solutions
(20 μM) in n-octanol (saturated with water)
were used for determination of molar absorbance (ε) values by
employing the Beer–Lambert law. A 15 mL of n-octanol and a magnetic stir bar were put into a 40 mL vial. A 15
mL of a PBS solution was added into the vial, after which the saturation
and the phase separation process were repeated. The concentration
of the SN compound in the organic layer (Co) was quantified by UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy.
The concentration of the SN compound in the aqueous layer
(Cw) was calculated from the equation Cw = 20 μM – Co. The partition coefficient (clog P) was determined from the relationship clog P = log(Co/Cw).

Solvatochromism
Fluorescence spectra of 10 μM SN2 solutions were acquired under a photoexcitation wavelength
399 nm, and peak wavenumbers of the spectra were determined. The Lippert–Mataga
plot was constructed as a function of polarity parameter (f); f = ((ε – 1)/(2ε
+ 1)) – ((n2 – 1)/(2n2 + 1)) (ε, dielectric constant; n, refractive index). f: toluene, 0.0135;
chloroform, 0.148; ethyl acetate, 0.200; 2-methyltetrahydrofuran,
0.210; dichloromethane, 0.218; N,N-dimethylformamide, 0.275; acetonitrile, 0.305.

ThT Assay
The kinetics of the formation of β-sheet-rich
Aβ aggregates was monitored by applying the ThT assay. Each
Aβ sample (20 μM), obtained after different incubation
time points at 37 °C with constant agitation (in 20 mM HEPES,
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl), was treated with 20 μM ThT. After 20 min,
the fluorescence intensity of ThT was measured using a Molecular Devices,
SpectraMax M5e microplate reader at λex = 440 nm
and λem = 490 nm.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM) Experiments
Aβ samples for TEM measurements were
prepared following previously
reported methods.83−87 Glow discharged grids (Formvar/Carbon 300 mesh, Electron Microscopy
Sciences, Hatfield, PA) were treated with samples (5 μL) of
(i) SN compound-free Aβ aggregates and (ii) Aβ
aggregates incubated with the SN compounds for 2 min
at room temperature. Excess sample was removed with filter paper,
and the grids were washed with ddH2O three times. Each
grid was stained with uranyl acetate (1% w/v ddH2O; 5 μL)
for 1 min. Uranyl acetate was blotted off, and the grids were dried
for at least 20 min at room temperature. Images of samples were taken
using a JEOL, JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (200 kV; 25 000×
magnification; UCRF, Ulsan, Republic of Korea).

Dot Blot Assay
Aβ aggregates with and without
treatment of SN2 and SN4 (2 μL), generated
with various durations of preincubation, were spotted on a nitrocellulose
membrane, and the membrane was blocked with a solution of bovine serum
albumin (BSA; 3% w/v; RMBIO, Missoula, MT) in Tris-buffered saline
containing 0.01% Tween 20 (TBS-T) at room temperature for 1.5 h. Then,
the membrane was incubated with a primary antibody, 6E10 (1:2000,
Covance, Princeton, NJ) or A11 (1:2500, Millipore, Billerica, MA)
in a solution of 2% w/v BSA in TBS-T for 1.5 h at room temperature.
After washing with TBS-T three times (7 min each), the horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (for 6E10) or goat anti-rabbit
(for A11) secondary antibody (1:5000, Cayman Chemical Company for
6E10; 1:2500, Promega for A11) in the solution of BSA (2% w/v in TBS-T)
was added to the membrane and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
A homemade ECL kit88 was used to visualize
the results on a Bio-Rad, ChemiDoc MP Imaging System. The same membrane
was stripped by treating it with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 30 min at room temperature, washed four times with TBS-T
for 10 min each, blocked with the solution of 3% w/v BSA in TBS-T,
and incubated with the primary antibodies (6E10 and A11).

Images of
Aβ Aggregates by Our Probes
Large-sized
Aβ aggregates were generated by incubating Aβ peptides
(370 μM for Aβ42; 260 μM for Aβ40) for 36 h at 37 °C with constant agitation. The resulting
Aβ species were treated with SN2 and SN4 (37 μM for Aβ42; 26 μM for Aβ40; final concentration of DMSO, 1% v/v) for 10 min prior to
imaging using a confocal microscope [Carl Zeiss, LSM 780 (KAIST Analysis
Center for Research Advancement, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea)].
The images were obtained with a 405 nm laser (2.0% power; 0.39 μs
as the pixel dwell; 89.6 μm as the pinhole size; 63× objective).
The emission was collected from 550 to 630 nm for SN2 and from 480 to 600 nm for SN4.

Preparation
of Cell Lysates
N2a APPwt neuroblastoma
cells were the generous gift of Professor Gopal Thinakaran (University
of Chicago). Cells were seeded in a six-well plate and incubated for
48 h. After removing media, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed
with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150
mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
1% Triton X-100) containing 1× protease cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 1 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride. The total protein concentration
in cell lysates was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay.

Fluorescence Detection of Aβ Aggregates
The fluorescence
responses of each probe (SN1–SN5;
2 μM; final concentration of DMSO, 1% v/v) to Aβ40, Aβ42, and ubiquitin (20 μM) were recorded
after 10 min incubation in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl (λex = 417, 399, 409, 404, and 396 nm for SN1, SN2, SN3, SN4, and SN5, respectively).

Cell Viability Assay
N2a neuroblastoma
cell line was
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA). The cell line was maintained in media containing 50% Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium and 50% Opti-MEM (Gibco), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U
mL–1 penicillin, and 100 mg mL–1 streptomycin (Gibco). The cells were grown and maintained at 37
°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cell viability
upon treatment of the SN compounds was determined using
the MTT assay (MTT = 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide, Sigma-Aldrich). N2a cells were seeded
in a 96-well plate (8000 and 3000 cells in 100 μL per well for
1 and 24 h incubation, respectively). The cells were treated with
compounds (1, 2, and 5 μM, 1% v/v final DMSO concentration)
and incubated for 1 and 24 h. After incubation, MTT (25 μL;
5 mg mL–1 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH
7.4, Gibco)) was added to each well and the plate was incubated for
4 h at 37 °C. Formazan produced by the cells was solubilized
using an acidic solution of N,N-dimethylformamide
(50% v/v, aq) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 20% w/v) overnight
at room temperature in the dark. The absorbance was measured at 600
nm using a microplate reader. Cell viability was calculated relative
to cells treated with an equivalent amount of DMSO. All experiments
were carried out in triplicate.
