Novel silver(I),
gold(I), and palladium(II) complexes were synthesized
with bidentate heteroditopic carbene ligands that combine an imidazol-2-ylidene
(nNHC) with a 1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene (tzNHC) connected by a propylene bridge. The silver(I) and gold(I) complexes
were dinuclear species, [M2(nNHC-tzNHC)2](PF6)2 (M = Ag
or Au), with the two bidentate ligands bridging the metal centers,
whereas in the palladium(II) complex [Pd(nNHC-tzNHC)2](PF6)2, the two
ligands were chelated on the same metal center. Because of the presence
of two different carbene units, isomers were observed for the gold(I)
and palladium(II) complexes. The molecular structures of the head-to-tail
isomer for gold(I) complexes, with a twisted or folded-syn conformation of the bridge between the carbene units, were determined
by X-ray diffraction analysis. The study was completed with a systematic
structural investigation through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
For palladium(II) species, the head-to-head form was structurally
characterized. The dinuclear gold(I) complexes were emissive in the
solid state in the blue region (PLQY up to 8%); time-dependent density
functional theory (abbreviated as TD-DFT) calculations disclosed that
the absorption bands have metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer character
and evidenced that the emission occurs from the T1 level
(phosphorescence).

Introduction
Since the isolation
of the first imidazol-2-ylidene in the early
90s,1 the interest of the scientific community
toward N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) has continuously increased.
Nowadays, NHCs are employed as efficient organocatalysts,2,3 although their main use remains as ligands for transition-metal
centers,4−9 and the resulting NHC complexes have found application in several
research areas, that is, catalysis, bioinorganic chemistry, and material
science.4,8,10−13 Also, bidentate di-NHCs have received quite a bit of attention,14−16 especially considering that, in this latter case, it is possible
to tune the stereoelectronic properties of the ligand by changing
the wingtip and backbone substituents of the heterocyclic ring, but
also by modifying the linker between the carbene units. Furthermore,
the nature of the bridge between the heterocyclic moieties can be
a key element in influencing the bridging rather than the chelating
coordination mode of the ligand to the metal centers: with short or
constrained linkers, a bridging coordination of the ligand between
different metals gives polynuclear structures, whereas with more flexible
bridges, the chelating coordination occurs preferentially.17,18 The majority of the examples reported in the literature regards
di-NHC based on two imidazol-2-ylidene rings (nNHC)
connected by an aliphatic or aromatic bridge; however, several heterocyclic
scaffolds are available to prepare heterocyclic carbenes, spanning
from the classical imidazole-, imidazoline-, or benzimidazole-ylidene
to other five-member rings, like pyrazole-, triazole-, or tetrazole-ylidene,
to six-, seven-, or four-member rings, or to more exotic ones.19,20 Among them, it is interesting to mention the 1,3,4-trisubstituted-1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene
compounds (tzNHCs), whose triazolium salt precursors
can be easily isolated via a click reaction, that is, the copper-catalyzed
alkyne azide cycloaddition (CuAAC), followed by the alkylation of
the nitrogen in the N-3 position.21 The
synthesis of heteroditopic carbene ligands, that is, ligands combining
two types of N-heterocyclic carbenes, is appealing because, in principle,
it should allow one to isolate original heterobimetallic species,
taking advantage of the different acidity of the heterocyclic rings.22−25 Moreover, the properties of a complex having a bidentate ligand
with mixed donors might not be intermediate with respect to those
of the corresponding homoditopic compounds. For example, a palladium(II)
complex with a dicarbene ligand having two different NHC donors was
found to display enhanced catalytic properties with respect to the
corresponding complexes with the homodicarbene ligands; this was explained
in terms of “electronic asymmetry” in the complex.26,27

In this work, the influence of a mixed nNHC-tzNHC dicarbene ligand was evaluated on the photoemission
properties of the corresponding dinuclear silver(I) and gold(I) complexes.
The employed ligands were designed with a propylene linker between
the nNHC and the tzNHC donors because
we demonstrated that this bridge has the right length and flexibility
to promote intramolecular metallophilic interactions, thus influencing
the luminescence properties28 and the reactivity
of the gold(I) complexes.29 The coordination
of these mixed dicarbenes was also extended to a palladium(II) complex,
which, compared to the gold(I) complexes, should present a different
coordination geometry (square planar vs linear) and a chelate coordination
of the ligand rather than a bridging one. The synthesis of the gold(I)
and palladium(II) complexes was readily achieved through transmetalation
of the dicarbene ligand from the corresponding silver(I) complexes.
Interestingly, in the case of homobimetallic gold(I) complexes, as
well as for the mononuclear palladium(II) complex, two isomers were
observed in solution. For gold(I) complexes, the luminescence properties
as well as the nature of the different possible isomers were investigated
through relativistic DFT and TD-DFT calculations.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of the Imidazolium–Triazolium Proligands
Two different
proligands with imidazolium and 1,2,3-triazolium
rings, connected by a propylene bridge, were successfully synthesized
following the procedure reported by Liebscher and described in Scheme 1.30,31

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the Proligands 1-PF6 and 2-PF6
The procedure involves three steps from 1-(pent-4-ynyl)-1H-imidazole: (i) formation of the triazole ring via the
CuAAC reaction; (ii) methylation of both the imidazole N3 and triazole
N1 nitrogen atoms using excess of methyl iodide, providing 1-I and 2-I; and (iii) anion exchange between I– and PF6– to give 1-PF6 and 2-PF6. The last step favors the solubility of the proligands in polar
solvents (DMSO and mostly CH3CN). The formation of the
desired imidazolium/triazolium salt was easily assessed by the 1H NMR spectra, which present two different signals located
at δ > 8.0 ppm attributable to the protons in position 2
of
the imidazolium moiety and in position 5 of the triazolium ring.

Synthesis of Silver(I) Complexes
The silver(I) di(N-heterocyclic
carbene) complexes 3 and 4 were synthesized
by reaction of the proper diazolium bis(hexafluorophosphate) salts, 1-PF6 and 2-PF6, respectively, with excess of silver(I) oxide in acetonitrile
at 85 °C for 48 h (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Silver(I) Complexes 3 and 4
Complex 4 was obtained as a stable off-white solid,
whereas complex 3, although spectroscopically pure, is
an oil that slowly decomposes. The disappearance of the signals at
δ above 8.0 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra is consistent
with the deprotonation at the positions C2-H of the imidazole moiety
and C5-H of the triazole ring. In the 13C NMR spectra,
two different signals are present at δ ca. 165 and 180 ppm,
attributable to the carbene carbons of the tzNHC-Ag
and nNHC-Ag moieties, respectively, in the typical
range reported in the literature.32 Finally,
the presence of the peak corresponding to the fragment [Ag2L2PF6]+ in the electrospray ionisation
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectra confirms the dinuclear dicationic
structure of the complexes, with the experimental isotopic distribution
in agreement with the simulated one. All these data suggest a dinuclear
structure for the silver complexes, with the two dicarbene ligands
bridging two different silver(I) centers; the structure with an nNHC facing a tzNHC appears the most probable
by analogy with related complexes reported in the literature,33 although a dynamic behavior in solution involving
more than one isomer cannot be excluded.

Synthesis of Gold(I) Complexes
Gold(I) complexes were
synthesized via two methods: (i) transmetalation of the dicarbene
ligand from the corresponding silver(I) complexes 3 and 4 using a Au/Ag 1:1 ratio, or (ii) deprotonation of the diazolium
salt with sodium acetate in the presence of the gold(I) precursor
AuCl(SMe2). The transmetalation procedure was employed
starting from both silver(I) complexes (Scheme 3), although with the ligand having the benzyl
substituent at the triazole ring, the reaction was performed in situ,
that is, without the preisolation of silver(I) complex 3, considering its oily nature and instability. For these reasons,
the gold(I) species, analogous to silver(I) complex 3, was also synthesized via deprotonation of the diazolium salt (Scheme 4).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Gold(I)
Complexes 5/5′ and 6/6′
Scheme 4 Synthesis of Gold(I) Complexes 5/5′
Interestingly, the NMR experiments
of the isolated solids via transmetalation
show two sets of signals in a close to 1:1 ratio, both in the 1H and in 13C NMR spectra, likely due to the presence
of the two isomers associable to the different coordination modes
of the heteroditopic ligands. An analogous result was also obtained
from the deprotonation reaction starting from the diazolium salt although
the observed ratio was 5:1 (complex 5 as the major isomer).
This difference in the molar ratio registered in the two synthetic
procedures can be ascribed to the different reaction temperatures,34 which should favor the formation of the most
stable isomer.

Due to the intrinsic ditopic nature of the ligands
and the possible
orientations of the propylene linker in the ligand, several isomers
could be figured out. The main difference regards the coordination
sphere around the metal centers (constitutional isomerism, Chart 1a): (i) in the head-to-tail
species, each gold(I) center is coordinated by one nNHC and one tzNHC; (ii) in the head-to-head species,
one gold(I) coordinates two nNHC and the other one
binds the two tzNHC. We labeled the crude mixture
of complexes 5/5′ and 6/6′, where the apostrophe indicates the head-to-head
isomer. Furthermore, considering the possible arrangements of the
bridge of the bidentate ligand, these two coordination isomers may
be present at least in four conformations (conformational isomerism):
the twisted (t), the folded-syn (fs), the folded-anti (fa), and the
stretched-out ones (s) (Chart 1b, represented only for the head-to-tail coordination).

Chart 1 Schematic Representation of the Possible Isomers for the Gold(I)
Dinuclear Complexesa
a (a) Head-to-head and head-to-tail
constitutional isomers and (b) the conformational isomers (twisted,
folded-syn, folded-anti, and stretched-out)
represented only for the head-to-tail coordination.



From this point of view, the two sets of signals might be associated
with two species differing in the arrangement of the bridge in the
bidentate ligands34,35 (conformational isomerism) or
in the head-to-head or head-to-tail coordination (constitutional isomerism).
In our opinion, the latter appears more convincing considering the
following factors. (i) The 1H NMR spectrum registered after
heating the solution of the mixture 6/6′ at 70 °C in an NMR tube remains unchanged and also the relative
ratio of the two sets of signals remains constant; if the two species
differ on the conformation of the bridge, upon increasing the temperature
a conversion or an exchange between the two species is expected, considering
the flexibility of the propylene linker. The unchanged spectra support
indirectly the presence of two constitutional isomers, which cannot
convert upon heating. (ii) The different conformations of the bridges
might not be retained in solution.36 (iii)
A similar di(nNHC) gold(I) complex, that is, [Au2(MeIm(CH2)3ImMe)2]2+ (Im = imidazole-2-ylidene), presents the same NMR spectrum profile
in the folded-syn or twisted conformation (Chart 1b).28,37 (iv) Starting from the mixture 6/6′, we were able to crystallize complex 6 (head-to-tail
coordination of the ligand with folded-syn conformation
of the bridges; see further in the text) and characterized it in solution.
Complex 6 is stable in solution, and no conversion to
the second species was observed; furthermore, the 1H NMR
analysis of the remaining solution, where the crystals were grown,
confirmed an increase of the 6′/6 ratio, thus supporting the presence of two different species like
two constitutional isomers are. (v) During a slightly modified synthesis,
the head-to-head isomeric form was isolated by crystallization (see
below and the structure of complex 7).

The formation
of the gold(I) complexes could be confirmed by the
presence of signals at ca. δ 170 and 185 ppm related to the
carbene carbons in positions 2 and 5 of the nNHC
and tzNHC, respectively, slightly downfield-shifted
from those observed for the related silver(I) complexes and in the
range of ppm reported in the literature for nNHC
and tzNHC gold(I) complexes.32,38 The dinuclear dicationic structure of complexes 5/5′ and 6/6′ was confirmed
by ESI-MS spectra, which present a signal attributed to the species
[Au2L2PF6]+ with the L
= nNHC-tzNHC dicarbene ligand.

By slow diffusion of diethyl ether into a solution of the mixtures 5/5′ and 6/6′ in acetonitrile, few crystals were obtained, and the molecular structure
of the crystallized compound was determined by X-ray diffraction.
In both cases, that is, starting from mixture 5/5′ or 6/6′, only crystals
of the head-to-tail isomer were isolated. Complexes 5 and 6 have a dinuclear dicationic nature with two dicarbene
ligands bridging the two gold atoms, and the two gold(I) centers are
coordinated to one tzNHC and one nNHC.

The ORTEP views of the cationic complexes are shown in Figures 1 and 2 together with the atomic numbering scheme. Relevant bond
distances and angles are reported in the captions. The flexible propylene
linkers allow a backfolded conformation of the bridges in both structures;39 however, in complex 5, they adopt
the folded-syn conformation (fs, Chart 1b), whereas in compound 6 the observed conformation is the twisted one (t, Chart 1). From this point
onward, also the arrangement of the bridge will be specified in the
notation of the complex. In the crystals of the cationic compound 5(fs), PF6– anions are present, whereas in those of 6(t), acetonitrile solvent molecules are also found. Both
cationic complexes present a dinuclear structure, with the two gold(I)
centers linearly dicoordinated, a geometry usually observed for metal
centers having a d10 electronic configuration. The bond
angles Ccarb-Au-Ccarb are close to the linearity
[176.1(2)° in 5(fs) and 176.7(3) and 175.5(3)° in 6(t)], and the bond distances are comparable to those reported for analogous
di(NHC) gold(I) complexes.28,40 The torsion angle Ccarb-Au···Au-Ccarb in 5(fs) is 20.2(1)°, and
in 6(t) it is close orthogonal [79.0(4) and 83.1(4)°].
Moreover, the Ccarb-Au···Au angle is close
to orthogonal in 6(t) [89.3(2), 94.5(2), 94.6(2), 82.8(2)°]
and bigger than 90° in 5(fs) [111.7(1)°]. This affects the Au···Au
separation, which is significantly different in the two complexes:
in 5(fs),
the gold atoms are separated by 3.3479(4) Å, whereas in 6(t), the 3.0680(5) Å gold-to-gold distance, being much
below the sum of the van der Waals radii for gold metal, is one of
the shortest ever observed in analogous di(NHC) gold(I) complexes
so far.40 This clearly suggests the presence
of aurophilic interaction between the two metals. In both structures,
the mean planes of the two imidazol rings coordinated to the same
Au atom are slightly twisted, the dihedral angles being 30.8(1)°
in 5(fs) and
18.6(1) and 17.7(1)° in 6(t). In the molecular and
crystal structures of 5(fs) and 6(t), no stacking is observed between
the planar ring moieties, except between the phenyl and triazole rings
in 6(t) labeled by atoms C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C16
and N8, N9, N10, C24, C25 (evidenced in Figure 3 by the ball and stick drawing). In fact,
these groups lie on almost parallel planes [dihedral angle of 8.1(4)°]
at a distance between the centroids of the rings of 3.764(6) Å.
The bridging coordination mode of the dicarbene ligands imposes coordination
chirality to complex 6(t). Nevertheless, the complex
crystallizes in the C2/c space group
and so both enantiomers are present in the crystals.

the parallel planes of the phenyl ring and the triazole one.

As stated above, the gold complexes 5/5′ were synthesized without isolation
of the silver complex, and, in
particular, the gold precursor AuCl(SMe2) was simply added
to the acetonitrile solution of the silver complex 3 once
filtered from the silver oxide in excess. In one of the first attempts
to synthesize the gold complexes, we performed the same reaction but
adding the gold(I) precursor directly to the reaction mixture, still
containing the silver oxide. By slow diffusion of diethyl ether in
the final acetonitrile solution, very few single crystals of 7 adequate for X-ray diffraction analysis were formed. In
the crystals of 7, two slightly different molecules of
trinuclear bimetallic compounds (molecule A and molecule B) of formula
[Au2(nNHC-tzNHC)2Ag(CH3CN)2]3+, PF6– anions, and diethyl ether molecules are present.
The crystal structures of the two cationic compounds are shown in Figure 4, together with a
selected atomic labeling scheme. Relevant bond distances and angles
of the two molecules are also reported in the caption. The trinuclear
compounds are composed of two gold and one silver metal atoms; interestingly,
the two gold atoms are linked by two head-to-head ligands in a twisted
conformation, and the fragment Ag(CH3CN)2 interacts
with one of the two Au centers. The Ag(CH3CN)2 fragment in the two molecules presents different geometrical parameters:
in fact, in molecule A, the two acetonitrile molecules are disposed
in a nearly linear mode (N–Ag–N bond angle 167.3(6)°),
whereas in molecule B, the same fragment presents a nearly trigonal
planar arrangement (N–Ag–N bond angle 129.6(8)°).
This affects also the Ag···Au distance, which is longer
in molecule A (2.8860(16) Å) than in molecule B (2.7165(18) Å).
The Au···Au distances (3.1195(8) Å and 3.0516(8)
Å for molecules A and B, respectively) are very similar in both
complexes and in agreement with the values measured in analogous bimetallic
dicarbene gold(I) complexes.28,37,39−41 The two molecules are adjacent in the crystal structure
with terminal Au2 atoms at a distance of 3.4295(7) Å. Moreover,
the imidazole rings of the ligands are stacked in almost parallel
planes (dihedral angle of 9.6(5)°), and the distance between
the centroids is 3.834(6) Å. The Au and Ag atoms of both molecules
are aligned on the same twofold crystallographic axis. Thus, the complexes
are symmetric, with one-half of both structures being correlated with
the other half by the twofold axis. A disordered diethyl ether molecule
separates the two stacked molecules. In both molecules, the benzyl
substituents of the bridging ligands point toward the Ag(CH3CN)2 fragment to minimize the steric hindrance. The imidazole
rings coordinated to the same Au atom (Au2A and Au2B) are slightly
twisted with dihedral angles of 34.3(6) and 29.7(16)°, whereas
the triazole rings coordinated to the same Au atom (Au1A and Au1B)
are almost coplanar [8.7(1) and 8.8(6)°].

Luminescence Properties
The photoluminescence properties
of silver(I) complex 4 and gold(I) complexes 5(fs) and 6(t), the isomers isolated by crystallization,
were analyzed at room temperature in the solid state as films obtained
by drop casting from acetonitrile solutions on a quartz substrate.
The silver complex 4 was found to be non-emissive, and
a darkening of the sample was observed after the analysis, consistent
with the known sensitivity of silver compounds to light exposure.
Both gold complexes displayed instead intense blue luminescence (Figure 5). The emission maximum
of 5(fs), centered at 430 nm, is blue-shifted of 50 nm
with respect to that of 6(t). We observed comparable
absolute emission quantum yields with maximum value of 8% for 6(t) that has also the shorter Au···Au distance
(3.068 Å, Table 1). This suggests a stronger aurophilic interaction than for 5(fs).

(PL,

b The emission follows a three-component
exponential decay; the reported τ is the average of the three
values.

The photoluminescence
excitation spectra (PLE, Figure 5) are centered in the UV region
with a low energy tail extending in the visible up to ca. 420 nm for 6(t) and are attributed to metal-to-ligand transitions, as
confirmed also by TD-DFT calculations of the lowest electronic absorption
(see below). In the case of complex 6(t), PL and PLE
bands are red-shifted relative to those of the corresponding diimidazolium
salt 2-PF6 (Figure S1). This is mainly ascribed to the perturbation provided
by coordination of the ligand to the metal centers. Instead, 1-PF6 did not show appreciable luminescence.
The emission decay curves of both 5(fs) and 6(t) were interpolated with
a three-exponential function, resulting in average lifetimes of 0.23
and 1.21 μs, respectively.

In the solid state, the emission
wavelength can be correlated to
the aurophilic interaction, which in turn might depend on the Au···Au
distance found in the single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. In
fact, a stronger aurophilic contact is expected to lead to a lower
emission energy. Accordingly, we observed the emission band of 6(t) red-shifted compared to that of 5(fs).

The emission properties
of gold(I) complexes depend both on the
extent of aurophilic interactions and on molecular stacking in the
lattice that can be tailored by the ligands thanks, for example, to
the presence of supramolecular interactions. In this case, we did
not observe the formation of particular supramolecular arrangements
in the solid state: in the dinuclear complex 6(t), the
Au···Au distance (3.068 Å) is indeed shorter than
that observed in highly emissive samples (PLQY = 96%, 3.272 Å)
having however a peculiar staggered arrangement in the unit cell.28 The absence of similar spatial arrangement of
the complexes in the crystals of 5(fs) and 6(t) could account for the
moderate quantum yields registered for these complexes. These results
further support the difficulty to foresee the extent of the luminescence
of this type of complexes because several factors (aurophilicity,
crystal packing, π–π interactions, etc.) play a
role preventing any a priori prediction.

DFT Analysis
As
described in the previous sections
and in particular in the description of the single-crystal structures,
the dinuclear gold(I) complexes can differ not only for the coordination
around gold (head-to-tail or head-to-head coordination of the heteroditopic
ligand) but also for the relative orientation of the propylene bridges:
twisted (t), folded-syn (fs), folded-anti (fa), and stretched-out (s) (Chart 1). Consequently, at
least eight isomers might be obtained for each gold(I)–gold(I)
complex. First, we optimized the structures of the four possible conformers
(t, fs, fa, s) of the head-to-tail
complex 6 at the ZORA-BLYP/TZ2P level of theory (Figure S2a). For complex 6(t), the
crystallographic coordinates were used as initial guess, whereas the
remaining three conformers were built manually. The twisted and both
the folded (syn and anti) conformers
(6(t), 6(fs), and 6(fa)) are close in energy, differing by ca. 3 kcal mol–1, whereas the energy of the stretched-out 6(s) is 11.3 kcal mol–1 higher than the most stable
one, 6(t). Importantly, this last complex is also the
one isolated by crystallization. Considering these results and the
obtained crystal structures, reported in the previous section, the
complexes 5, 5′, and 6′ were also optimized at the ZORA-BLYP/TZ2P level of theory but considering
only the twisted and folded-syn conformation of the
bridges (Figure S2b). For 5(fs), the crystallographic
coordinates were used as initial guess, whereas the other structures
were built manually. The comparison between the computed and crystallographic
structures reveals a nice agreement; the Au–Au distance is
only slightly overestimated. In all the complexes, the Au–Au
distance is in the range 3.01–3.29 Å. The position of
the propylene bridges affects the overall geometry since it imposes
a more spherical shape (twisted conformer) or a hemispherical shape
(folded-syn species), leading to an antiparallel
and an almost parallel orientation of the C-Au-C axes, respectively.
Notably, the shortest Au–Au distances (3.01–3.17 Å)
are calculated for the twisted structures [5(t), 5′(t), 6(t), and 6′(t)] and the longest ones (3.24–3.31 Å) in the remaining
complexes. In general, the antiparallel orientation of the C-Au-C
axes (twisted conformer) increases the stability of the complex; only 5(fs) lies 2.0
kcal mol–1 below 5(t), as reported
in Table S1. In fact, besides aurophilicity,
the secondary interactions of the bulky ligands must be taken into
account (see Figure S3 and comments in
the Supporting Information for details).
The unexpected stability of 5(fs) compared to 5(t) is likely due
to the pronounced shift of the Au biscarbene moieties and the onset
of two Au−π interactions with both phenyl rings (the
distance between the metal and the centroids is 3.7 Å), which
are arranged so that the overall molecular symmetry is almost perfectly
C2 (binary axis orthogonal to the Au-Au axis).

Focusing
on complexes 5(fs) and 6(t), the presence of symmetry in the former
reflects in a greater stability in terms of the HOMO–LUMO gap
(Table 2). The frontier
Kohn–Sham MOs in 6(t) have strong metal (HOMO)
and strong ligand (LUMO) character, respectively; conversely, in 5(fs), HOMO lobes
are significantly expanded on the ligands (51.01% Au nuclei and 28.28%
ligands), whereas LUMO is strongly ligand centered (Figure 6).

analysis for all the

b Only the relevant contributions
are summed, explaining why the total sum is not 100%.

To understand the luminescence properties
of 6(t) and 5(fs), we first
calculated their absorption spectra in the gas phase with the aim
of identifying the lowest and strongest excitations from the ground
state. The SAOP model combined with all-electron TZ2P basis sets was
employed, and scalar relativistic effects were taken into account.

For 6(t), the lowest singlet–singlet absorption
(S1 ← S0) falls in the near-visible region
at 390.6 nm (f = 0.09) and corresponds to an almost
purely monoelectronic HOMO–LUMO transition (98.3%) with net
metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer (MLCT) character. A bunch of absorptions
at close wavelengths is then found in the range 375–346 nm.
In these transitions, the MLCT character is less pronounced because
the filled MOs of the couples involved in the dominant excitations
have a significant ligand percentage contribution. Another group of
close peaks falls in the range 346–328 nm with similar or even
pure ligand-to-ligand character. The strong absorption at 310 nm is
due to ligand-based transitions, but the lack of dominant contributions
precludes a precise assignment.

The lowest absorption in the
UV–vis spectrum of 5(fs) is blue-shifted if
compared to that of 6(t); it is computed at 378 nm (f = 0.002). It is ascribed to an almost pure HOMO–LUMO
monoelectronic transition (99.4%) with net MLCT character as observed
for 6(t). Another absorption of similar intensity (f = 0.004) is computed at 365 nm and has monoelectronic
composition HOMO – 1 – LUMO + 1 (99.4%) with ligand-to-ligand
character. In the transitions corresponding to the intense peaks computed
at 337, 322, and 315 nm, the MLCT character decreases since the contributions
of the Au lobes on the involved filled MOs are rather small. Finally,
the very intense absorptions at 289 and 283 nm (f = 0.07 in both cases) involve couples of delocalized MOs with significant
metal and ligand contributions.

The composition of the lowest
singlet–triplet absorption
(T1 ← S0) is almost identical to the
singlet–singlet one, that is, 99% HOMO–LUMO, and falls
at 384 nm (5(fs)) and at 397.3 nm (6(t)). Both 5(fs) and 6(t) were
fully optimized in the lowest triplet state, and the phosphorescence
wavelengths were estimated subtracting the energy of the ground state
(level of theory: ZORA-BLYP/TZ2P). Emission as phosphorescence is
calculated at 384 nm (5(fs)) and 431 nm (6(t)). These wavelengths
are blue-shifted with respect to the experimental ones, but their
separation is in very good agreement (experimental 47 nm vs calculated
50 nm), considering also that the SAOP potential, which is optimized
for excited states, was not used because it not available for the
triplet geometry optimization.

The Au···Au interaction
is greatly enhanced in the
T1 excited state, with much shorter Au···Au
distances compared to those measured in the ground state (see Table S3). This was already observed in other
dinuclear gold(I) complexes having bridging dicarbenes or diphosphines
coordinated to the metal centers.28,37,42

Synthesis of Palladium(II) Complex
The study on the
coordinating properties of this type of nNHC-tzNHC ligands was also extended to palladium(II), a metal
center characterized by a coordination geometry different from linearity,
with the aim to explore the possibility of obtaining isomers even
when this type of ligands is in a chelate fashion. The transmetalation
of the dicarbene ligand was successfully used for the syntheses of
palladium(II) complexes 8/8′ starting
from the silver(I) complex 4. [PdCl2(COD)]
(COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) was used as the palladium precursor due
to the labile nature of the diene ligand, and the reaction was performed
in acetonitrile at room temperature for 3 h with an Ag/Pd 2:1 molar
ratio (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of the Complexes 8/8′
As already observed for gold
complexes, two sets of signals can
be detected in both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra,
associable to the two isomers 8 and 8′ (Scheme 5) in a 3:2
ratio (referred to the CH3 signals). This might be explained
with a different stability of the two species, related to the different
steric hindrance around the metal center. In fact, in complex 8′, the phenyl rings are in close proximity, and therefore
this conformer is expected to be less stable.

The chelating
coordination of the ligands on the metal center is
supported by the presence of several multiplets associated with the
CH2 protons of the bridge as a consequence of the formation
of a rigid 8-membered metallacycle. The 13C NMR spectrum
further supports the coordination of the dicarbene ligand to the palladium(II)
center: the nNHC carbene carbon signal is observed
at δ ca. 171 ppm, coherent with the literature.43−45 The ESI-MS spectra accredit the coordination of two ligands on the
same metal center due to the presence of the fragment [PdL2PF6]+ (with L = nNHC-tzNHC dicarbene ligand) at m/z 813.19.

By slow diffusion of diethyl ether into an acetonitrile
solution
of complexes 8/8′, single crystals
were obtained; the crystal structure was solved by X-ray diffraction
studies. In Figure 7, the molecular structure of the palladium complex 8 is shown.

C9–Pd1–C1 87.6(2). Code for atoms: ′ = −x, −y, −z.

It confirms the dicationic nature
of complex 8 with
two dicarbene ligands chelating on the palladium center and forming
two 8-membered rings. The cationic compound crystallizes with the
PF6– anion and acetonitrile solvent molecules.
The structure of the cationic complex is centrosymmetric, with the
metal atom located on the inversion center. The palladium(II) presents,
as expected, a square planar configuration: the C1-Pd1-C9 and C9-Pd1-C1
deviated slightly from the ideal 90° value (92.4(2) and 87.6(2)°).
The distances between the palladium(II) center and the carbene carbon
atoms are 2.062(6) Å (nNHC) and 2.058(5) Å
(tzNHC), in the expected range of distances for this
type of compounds.26,46−48 The dihedral
angle between the phenyl substituent and the triazole ring is twisted
by 71.84°, thus minimizing the steric hindrance.

Conclusions
Gold(I) and palladium(II) complexes based on bidentate heteroditopic nNHC-tzNHC dicarbene ligands were successfully
synthesized via transmetalation of the dicarbene ligand from the corresponding
silver(I) complex. The gold(I) complexes are dinuclear species with
the two bidentate ligands bridging the two metal centers, whereas
the palladium(II) complex is mononuclear with the two dicarbene ligands
chelating the metal. In the case of gold(I) and palladium(II) complexes,
two isomers, that is, head-to-tail or head-to-head, were obtained
due to the two different carbene moieties on the ligand. The stability
of the other plausible gold(I) isomers was analyzed through DFT calculations,
which confirm that the species that crystallize are the most stable
ones. The presence of the two isomers was not evident for silver(I)
complexes probably because of the well-known dynamic behavior of the
silver carbene species.34 Interestingly,
the gold(I) complexes were found to emit (PLQY 8%) in the blue region;
the comparison between the measured luminescence and the results of
the DFT calculations for the S0 ← T1 transition
is in good agreement.

Considering the presence of two different
carbene functions on
the ligand, we are currently working on the possibility of obtaining
heterobimetallic complexes via step-by-step deprotonation of the azolium
rings of the dicarbene proligand.

Materials
and Methods
Reagents and solvents were high-purity
commercially available products and generally used as received. All
manipulations were carried out using standard Schlenk techniques under
an atmosphere of argon or dinitrogen. NMR spectra were recorded on
a Bruker Avance 300 MHz (300.1 MHz for 1H, 121.5 for 31P, and 75.5 for 13C) or on a Bruker DMX 600 (599.98
MHz for 1H NMR and 150.07 MHz for 13C NMR) or
on a Bruker DRX 400 (400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13C); chemical shifts (δ) are reported in units of ppm
relative to the residual solvent signals. High-resolution mass spectroscopy
(HR-MS) analyses were performed in the ESI mode using a microTOF instrument
(Bruker Daltonics). ESI-MS analyses were performed using an LCQ-Duo
(Thermo-Finnigan) operating in the positive ion mode. Compounds were
dissolved in acetonitrile, and the sample solutions were directly
infused into the ESI source by a syringe pump. Elemental analyses
were carried out with a Thermo Scientific FLASH 2000 apparatus. 1-(Pent-4-ynyl)-1H-imidazole, proligand 1-I was prepared according
to the literature procedure.31 In a few
cases, the elemental analysis results exceed the range accepted for
establishing the analytical purity of a compound, but they represent
the best obtained values. The purity of the compounds was also established
on the basis of NMR spectra (the products are completely soluble in
the NMR solvent, and only the signals of the analyzed species are
recorded) and HR-ESI measurements.

A mixture of sodium acetate (0.015 g, 0.183
mmol), the diimidazolium salt 1-PF6 (0.048 g, 0.082 mmol), and AuCl(SMe2) (0.024 g,
0.082 mmol) in dimethylformamide (10 mL) was heated and maintained
at 120 °C for 3 h. The mixture was then filtered on Celite, and n-hexane (70 mL), dichloromethane (10 mL), and diethyl ether
(50 mL) were added to the filtrate, affording a white solid. The precipitate
was filtered and dried under vacuum (yield 77%). The 1H
NMR spectra show two sets of signals, attributable to the complexes 5 and 5′, in a ca. 4:1 ratio. Crystals
of complex 5 were obtained by slow diffusion of diethyl
ether into an acetonitrile solution of the crude mixture.

Crystal Structure Determination
of Compounds 5, 6, 7, and 8
The crystallographic
data for compounds 5, 6, 7,
and 8 were collected on a Bruker Apex II single-crystal
diffractometer working with monochromatic Mo Kα radiation and
equipped with an area detector.49 The structures
were solved by direct methods and refined against F2 with
SHELXL-2014/7 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen
atoms,50 except the carbon and oxygen atoms
of the diethyl ether solvent molecule in compound 7 that
have been refined isotropically. In some cases, the propyl chains
of the ligands have been found disordered in two positions and refined
with the appropriate occupancy factor. Idealized geometries were assigned
to the hydrogen atoms. For the molecular graphics, Program ORTEP-3
for Windows has been used.51 Crystal data
for the four compounds are reported in Table 3. Crystallographic data have been deposited
with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as supplementary publication.
Copies of the data can be obtained free of charge on application to
the CCDC, 12 Union Road, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, U.K. (fax, (+44) 1223

Luminescence Studies
Luminescence
spectra were recorded
at room temperature on films obtained by drop casting a sample solution
in acetonitrile on a quartz substrate using an optical fiber bundle
coupled to the spectrofluorimeter (Fluorolog-3, Horiba JobinYvon)
equipped with a double-grating monochromator on both the excitation
and emission sides. A 450 W Xe arc lamp and an R928P Hamamatsu photomultiplier
were employed as the excitation source and the detector, respectively.
The emission spectra were corrected for detection and optical spectral
response of the spectrofluorimeter supplied by the manufacturer. The
excitation spectra were corrected for the spectral distribution of
the lamp intensity using a photodiode reference detector. Absolute
photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) were measured by means of
a Spectralon-coated integrating sphere accessory (4″, F-3018,
Horiba Jobin-Yvon) fitted in the fluorimeter sample chamber. Three
independent measurements were carried out on each sample, and the
error on PLQY was 20%.

Photoluminescence decay curves were obtained
through single-photon experiments using a 295 nm pulsed LED as excitation
sources (Horiba NanoLED). The collected data were analyzed with Horiba
DAS6 Decay Analysis Software.

Computational Details
Density functional theory (DFT)
calculations were carried out with the Amsterdam density functional
(ADF) program.52−54 The BLYP55−58 density functional was used, and the Grimme dispersion
was added (BLYP-D3(BJ)).59 The zeroth-order
regular approximation (ZORA)60 was chosen,
including the scalar relativistic effects, as recommended in the presence
of heavy nuclei.61−63 The TZ2P basis set, which is a large uncontracted
set of Slater-type orbitals (STOs), of triple-ζ quality and
augmented with two sets of polarization functions on each atom (2p
and 3d in the case of H, 3d and 4f in the case of C and N, 6g and
7h in the case of Au), was employed. The frozen-core approximation
was used for the core electrons: up to 1s for C and N and up to 4d
in the case of Au. For the numerical integration, the Becke grid was
used.64,65 This level of theory gave reliable results
in recent studies on gold complexes.66−68 TD-DFT calculations
were performed on the optimized geometries of 5(fs) and 6(t) in the
gas phase using all-electron TZ2P basis sets for all of the atoms.
SAOP, which is an appropriate exchange-correlation potential with
the statistical averaging of (model) orbitals, was chosen to calculate
the excitation energies69,70 because it reliably
describes the excited states of organometallic compounds.71−73 The lowest 30 singlet–singlet as well as singlet–triplet
excitations were computed. The lowest triplet states of 5(fs) and 6(t) were fully optimized in order to estimate the phosphorescence wavelengths
of 5(fs) and 6(t); the BLYP-D3(DJ) functional combined with the TZ2P small
core basis set for all the atoms was used in these unrestricted calculations;
scalar relativistic effects were included with the ZORA formalism.
