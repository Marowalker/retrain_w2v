Investigation
into the interactions between biomolecules DNA/RNA
and carbon nanomaterials is very important for applications in bioassays
and bioanalysis. Graphene and graphene oxide (GO) have been successfully
adopted by exploiting the binding affinity difference between single-stranded
oligonucleotides (ssDNA) and double-stranded oligonucleotides (dsDNA)
to graphene sheets. In this work, we describe the electrochemical
DNA oxidation with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to understand
the interaction between dsDNA (and corresponding ssDNA) and reduced
graphene oxide (rGO). The electrochemical oxidation rate of guanine
bases of ssDNA bound to rGO by electrochemically generated [Ru(bpy)3]3+ was much slower than those unbound to rGO.
Our study revealed that ssDNA constrained on rGO was significantly
protected from the electron transfer to [Ru(bpy)3]3+ because of π,π-stacking interaction between
nucleobases and rGO. On the other hand, the oxidation rates of 11-,
20-, and 27-mer dsDNA bound to rGO increased relative to those of
dsDNA alone, demonstrating that the guanine bases of dsDNA on the
interaction with rGO became more accessible to [Ru(bpy)3]3+. Our electrochemical data illustrated that dsDNA could
be totally or partially dehybridized and bind to rGO to form ssDNA/rGO.
Furthermore, absorption, circular dichroism spectra, and fluorescence
measurements of ethidium bromide using ssDNA and dsDNA with rGO supported
the dehybridization of dsDNA in the presence of rGO.

1 Introduction
The
nanobio interfaces between nanomaterials and oligonucleotides
have been fabricated and studied for fundamental significance and
practical importance in materials science, biosensing, and biomedicine.1−3 Recently, the integration of single-stranded and duplex DNA with
nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene, graphene
oxides (GO), and metal nanoparticles, has been substantially advanced.1,2 For example, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was shown to adsorb on
CNT, thereby enhancing the water solubility of CNTs.4,5 DNA-/CNT-based devices were developed for biosensing and biomedical
applications.5,6 In addition, ssDNA was used to
wrap on CNTs and then separate metallic CNT.7

Luminescence and electrochemical methods have been often used
to
study the interaction of DNA with carbon nanomaterials such as CNT,
graphene, and GO. Among these studies, the interaction of DNA with
GO was investigated with great interest. In recent works, ssDNA interacted
strongly with graphene or GO, while double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and
folded ssDNA (such as G-quadruplex and hairpin structures) showed
much lower affinity.8−11 Overall, ssDNA readily adsorbed onto graphene by π,π-stacking
interactions between graphene and nucleobases, which were supported
by molecular simulations about the fundamental interactions between
graphene materials and ssDNA.12 However,
the interactions between dsDNA and carbon nanomaterials need to be
studied more, even though dsDNA interacts weakly with graphene and
GO. Because of these unique interaction properties of ssDNA and dsDNA
with graphene complexes, the application of graphene materials in
biosensing and other bioengineering has recently attracted significant
attention. For examples, complexes of ssDNA and GO were studied for
new biomedical and bioassay platforms. DNA aptamers were well protected
by GO from enzymatic cleavage during cellular transport.9,13 Such different properties of ssDNA and dsDNA on the interaction
with GO will be utilized more in DNA and protein analysis, gene and
drug delivery, etc.

In the fluorescence studies, the most common
strategy is to utilize
fluorescence quenching of fluorophores covalently attached to a probe
DNA on GO.14,15 Then, the fluorescence of the
probe is recovered after the formation of dsDNA with a target strand,
which is detached from GO by hybridization. As reported elsewhere,
the binding energy by base pairs in dsDNA was greater than the π,π-stacking
interaction energy of a single-stranded oligonucleotide with GO. Therefore,
their data were interpreted that the probe DNA strands on GO were
desorbed to make double strands upon treatment with a target strand.
However, GO was also reported to protect dsDNA from enzymatic digestion
by forming dsDNA–GO complexes or a partial deformation of the
double helix.10−16 Therefore, further study is required to clarify the interactions
of dsDNA with graphene and related nanomaterials.

Electrochemical
studies of DNA nanomaterials have been reported
to understand the interaction between DNA and nanomaterials and develop
biosensors.4,17,18 Many kinds of nanoparticles, such as metals, metal oxides, and semiconductor
nanoparticles, have been used for constructing electrochemical sensors
and biosensors. These nanoparticles play different roles in different
sensing systems, such as the immobilization of biomolecules, the catalysis
of electrochemical reactions, the enhancement of electron transfer
between electrodes and biomolecules, the labeling of biomolecules,
and even acting as a reactant.19,20 Recently, we reported
the direct electrochemical oxidation of oligonucleotides attached
to Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) using a tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)
complex, Ru(bpy)32+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine).18 Depending on the size of AuNPs, the oxidation
rates of the oligonucleotides varied because of different curvatures
of ssDNA at the AuNP–water interfaces. In terms of carbon nanomaterials,
carbon nanotubes having poor solubility in both aqueous and nonaqueous
solvents were wrapped with 50-mer thymine bases to make carbon nanotubes
(CNT) soluble in buffer solution, and the electrochemical oxidation
of CNT was studied by a molecular Ru mediator. However, to the best
of our knowledge, the oligonucleotide-mediated assembly of rGO, interactions
of rGO especially with dsDNA, and electrochemical studies have not
been reported up to now.

Ru(bpy)32+ has
been used in electrochemical
studies to detect oligonucleotides.18,21−23 As Ru(bpy)32+ has the high oxidation potential
at 1.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl), the electrochemically generated Ru(bpy)33+ can oxidize guanine bases in DNA (shown in equations
below). The oxidative scan of Ru(bpy)32+ in
the presence of DNA containing guanines affords big catalytic currents
because of the oxidation of guanines to regenerate Ru(bpy)32+ from Ru(bpy)33+ during the scanning
time. On the basis of this concept, detection of target DNA strands
and adenosine using a specific DNA probe was reported in buffer solutions.21−23 However, the electrochemical oxidation of ssDNA and dsDNA in the
presence of graphene nanomaterials has not been reported up to now
to understand their interaction properties.    Herein, we first report the electrochemical
study to understand the interaction of single- and double-stranded
oligonucleotides with rGO and behavior of oligonucleotides at the
rGO–water interface. The oxidation rate of guanine bases in
DNA by [Ru(bpy)3]3+ slowed down as ssDNA was
adsorbed on rGO. On the basis of our electrochemical and spectroscopic
studies, we found that dsDNA was significantly dehybridized on the
interaction with rGO. We believe that this work could help to understand
the properties of such DNA–rGO hybrid materials and thus will
advance the research of DNA–graphene materials for applications
in biosensors and bionanotechnology.

2 Results
and Discussion
Three different DNA sequences containing guanine
bases were used
to prepare DNA–rGO hybrid materials and study their interaction
and electrochemical properties (Table 1). The electrochemical oxidation of single-stranded
G11 was first studied with Ru(bpy)32+ (bpy =
2,2′-bipyridine) in the absence of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
in a phosphate buffer at room temperature. G11 alone afforded a big
oxidative current enhancement at 1.1 V at a scan rate of 25 mV/s,
as reported with other oligonucleotides containing guanine (Figures 1a and S1). The current enhancement in the presence
of G11 is due to the catalytic oxidation of guanine bases by Ru(bpy)33+ electrogenerated in the process of oxidative
scan. However, the catalytic current with dsDNA G11//C11 alone was
lower than that with G11 because the accessibility of the Ru mediator
to the guanines of the double-stranded DNA became lower in solution,
as reported elsewhere (Figures 1b and S1).21−23 The other strands,
G20 and B24G3, also showed similar trends (Figure S1). As reported earlier, the number of guanines in oligonucleotides
affected the catalytic current. The oxidative current with G20 turned
out the biggest, followed by G11 and B24G3 (Figures S1 and S2).

and G11//C11–rGO (red solid line) in phosphate buffer solution
with 50 μM Ru(bpy)32+. The cyclic voltammogram
of 50 μM Ru(bpy)32+ alone was plotted
as a black dashed line. The stock solution of rGO was 0.6 mg/mL, and
the scan rate was 25 mV/s. No current enhancement was observed for
rGO alone when Ru(bpy)32+ was used.

Then, when G11 was incubated with
rGO, it could interact with rGO
by the π,π-stacking interaction and then the hybrid material
G11/rGO was formed (Figure 2). Under the conditions in Figure 1, the amount of rGO was for a compete adsorption
of DNA based on the electrochemical and emission measurements. We
tried to observe a difference in the guanine oxidation current by
Ru(bpy)33+ between G11 and G11/rGO. The oxidation
current of G11/rGO significantly decreased (Figure 1a). The current decreased progressively with
increasing rGO (Figure S3). Because rGO
was not oxidized by Ru(bpy)33+ under the conditions
(Figure S4), the reduction of the catalytic
current derived from a relatively slow electron transfer from the
guanine bases of G11/rGO to Ru(bpy)33+. The
phosphate backbone of G11 in G11/rGO is directed to the aqueous solution,
and the guanine bases are toward rGO for stacking interaction. Then,
the electron transfer from the guanines of G11 to Ru(bpy)33+ was slowed down because of the slow electron transfer
rate due to the low accessibility to guanines. In a control experiment,
C11/rGO prepared with C11 and rGO afforded no significant current
increase. The catalytic current with G11/rGO was confirmed to derive
from the oxidation of guanines, not rGO. However, it was reported
that CNT wrapped with T50 was oxidized by electrochemically generated
Ru(III) species having a lower redox potential than Ru(bpy)32+, indicating the oxidation of CNT.4 Therefore, our data demonstrate that rGO should be less
easily oxidized than CNT because rGO was not oxidized by Ru(bpy)33+.

DNA and
reduced graphene oxide, showing the formation of G11/rGO, G11/C11–rGO,
and G11/rGO/C11. (b) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of G11/rGO (top) and G11/C11–rGO (bottom), and the corresponding
energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping images of C and
P.

Then, G11//C11 was used to observe
changes in current when interacted
with rGO. It was reported that ssDNA was bound to GO with a high affinity,
while dsDNA or well-folded ssDNA (such as G-quadruplex, etc.) exhibited
much lower affinity. According to these observations, the current
with G11//C11 would be expected to be almost the same as that with
a mixture of G11//C11 and rGO because G11//C11 would remain the same
even in the presence of rGO. In practice, when G11//C11 was treated
with rGO, the current interestingly increased (Figure 1b). The current obtained with G11//C11–rGO
was almost the same as that with G11/rGO. The current enhancement
meant that G11//C11 was completely dehybridized and the dehybridized
C11 and G11 were attached to rGO (Figure 2a). The TEM images of G11/rGO and G11/C11–rGO
were obtained, and the corresponding EDS mapping images indicated
the presence of DNA (Figure 2b). In a control experiment with a G11/rGO/C11 sample in which
G11 was incubated first with rGO and then with C11, a similar current
was obtained as that with G11//C11–rGO (Figure S5). These observations implied that the solvent accessibility
of G11//C11 should be lower than that of G11//C11–rGO. It seems
that the binding energy between G11 and C11 formed by hydrogen bonding
would be lower than the π,π-stacking interaction energy
between rGO and the single strands of G11 and C11. These results were
somewhat different from those observed in other studies using fluorescence
measurements, showing that dsDNA interacted more weakly with graphene
and stayed without a change. Recently, the partial deformation of
21-mer dsDNA was also reported on the interaction with GO, on the
basis of enzymatic activity studies of dsDNA.16 The reasons for the different observations in the interactions of
ssDNA and dsDNA with carbon nanomaterials might derive from the use
of different graphene materials, such as graphene and GO in their
studies, instead of rGO. Further detailed studies using carbon nanomaterials
are needed to make two different observations clear.

Because
the binding energy between two single strands of a dsDNA
depends on the number of bases, 20- and 27-mer dsDNA, such as G20//C20
and B24G3//B24C3, were used in the presence of rGO for the electrochemical
study. For both dsDNA, similar results were obtained in that the oxidative
current with dsDNA increased on the interaction with rGO (Figures S6 and S7). These results demonstrate
that the 20- and 27-mer dsDNA were also dehybridized on the interaction
with rGO to afford the higher solvent accessibility to the Ru mediator.
Especially, B24G3//B24C3 containing GGG in the middle of the sequence
was also deformed with rGO and the GGG part of B24G3/rGO became more
readily exposed to the solvent relative to those in dsDNA. These results
indicated that the double-stranded DNA of 27-mer was also significantly
dehybridized because of the π,π-stacking interaction with
rGO.

Then, absorption spectra of G20, G20//C20, G20/rGO, and
G20//C20–rGO
were recorded to understand the interaction of DNA with rGO further
and check the deformation of G20//C20 by rGO. When G20 was adsorbed
on rGO, the absorbance of G20/rGO decreased at 260 nm relative to
G20 alone, as reported in other studies with CNT and AuNPs (Figure 3a).18,24 Absorption spectra of G20//C20 and G20//C20–rGO were also
recorded to check the extent of dehybridization of G20//C20 in the
presence of rGO (Figure 3b). The absorbance of G20//C20–rGO also decreased at 260 nm.
However, the absorption spectrum of G20//C20–rGO was very similar
to that observed with G11/rGO but exhibited a little higher absorbance
at 260 nm. These results also supported that G20//C20 was deformed
on the interaction with rGO and then two single strands would bind
to rGO.

Figure 3 Absorption spectra of (a) 5 μM G20 (black dashed line), G20/rGO
(red solid line), and rGO (blue dotted line), and (b) 5 μM G20//C20
(black dashed line), G20//C20–rGO (red solid line), and rGO
(blue dotted line) in 0.1 M Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).

To study the interaction of duplex DNA with rGO
further, circular
dichroism (CD) spectra were investigated for B24G3//B24C3 and rGO.
Duplex DNA had two peaks on the CD spectrum, a positive peak at about
275 nm and a negative peak at about 246 nm (Figure 4). Upon the addition of increasing amount
of rGO (20 and 40 μL of a stock solution), a consistent decrease
was seen both for the negative and the positive peak, indicating that
the duplex DNA was dissociated. The CD spectrum of B24G3//B24C3–rGO
sample was similar to that of B24G3/rGO, implying that dsDNA was dehybridized
on the interaction with rGO. CD experiments with G20//C20 and rGO
also afforded similar results (Figure S8). Such CD spectral changes were also observed with other dsDNA sequences
with GO, which were interpreted as a partial deformation of dsDNA.25,26

dichroism (CD) spectra of B24G3//B24C3 (black dashed line)
and B24G3//B24C3–rGO (20 μL rGO, orange solid line; 40
μL rGO, red solid line) in 0.1 M Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).

In addition, photoluminescence
(PL) study was carried out to understand
further the interaction between dsDNA and rGO using the strong intercalating
property of ethidium bromide (EtBr) into dsDNA. EtBr intercalated
into dsDNA exhibits strong characteristic fluorescence. The PL spectra
are recorded for EtBr alone, and EtBr with rGO, G20, G20//C20, and
G20//C20–rGO (Figure 5). G20//C20 treated with EtBr showed a strong emission at
590 nm on excitation at 480 nm, as expected from a well-established
intercalation property of EtBr into dsDNA. EtBr alone had no significant
emission in buffer solution, and G20 with EtBr afforded much smaller
intensity than that of G20//C20. G20//C20–rGO also afforded
a much lower emission, relative to that with G20//C20. The lower intensity
with dsDNA in the presence of rGO could be interpreted as the conformational
change of dsDNA on the interaction with rGO, which leads to the deformation
of the duplex DNA. In a control experiment, the emission spectrum
of G20–rGO–C20 was almost the same as that obtained
with G20//C20–rGO. These data demonstrated that G20//C20 was
dehybridized and the single-stranded G20 and C20 were adsorbed on
rGO by π,π-interaction.

3 Conclusions
On the
basis of this study, we found that single-stranded DNA interacted
strongly with rGO to form stable ssDNA/rGO hybrid materials in aqueous
solution and ssDNA bound to rGO was effectively protected from guanine
oxidation by electrochemically generated [Ru(bpy)3]3+. Such strong interaction of ssDNA with rGO also derived
from π,π-stacking interaction well reported in other studies
with graphene and GO.11,12 The current enhancement of dsDNA–rGO
solution relative to dsDNA alone implied that dsDNA was deformed and
would bind to rGO as single strands. In studies reporting no significant
interaction of dsDNA with graphene-based materials, and desorption
of ssDNA from graphene materials by a complementary strand, various
lengths of DNA were used, from 12-mer to 50-mer oligonucleotides.9,11,12,16,27 Consequently, it seems not just a matter
of DNA length. Several factors, such as DNA sequence, length, hybridization,
heterogeneous structure of graphene materials, etc., should be considered
for complete understanding of such interesting and complex biointerfacial
systems. Further studies are necessary to understand interaction properties
between DNA and graphene-based materials in aqueous solution.

In addition, absorption, CD, and fluorescence studies suggested
that ssDNA and dsDNA of 11-, 20-, and 27-mer oligonucleotides would
be promptly bound to rGO forming strong noncovalent interactions and
a significant dehybridization of dsDNA occurs in the presence of rGO.
Under the similar conditions in aqueous solutions, we observed that
the oxidation potential of rGO was much higher than that of CNT.4 As shown in our findings, conformational changes
of DNA on the interaction with nanomaterials can afford different
electrochemical signals to have potential for biomolecular recognition
and sensing because graphene-based materials have been utilized in
various electrochemical sensors. This study connects the biomolecule,
DNA, with a two-dimensional carbon nanomaterial, reduced graphene
oxide, demonstrating that the unique electrochemical properties of
the DNA/rGO platform may inspire applications in biotechnology, biosensors,
and biomedical research works.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Instrumentation
Water
was purified with a Milli-Q purification system. Oligonucleotides
were purchased from GenoTec Inc. (Deajon, Korea) and purified by high
performance liquid chromatography (Youngin Instrument, Korea, Acme
9000) using a Thermo Hypersyl Gold Column (0.46 × 25 cm2). The oligonucleotide concentrations were measured on a BioSpec-nano
spectrophotometer (220 V, 40VA Shimadzu, Japan). The working electrode
was tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) obtained from Delta Technology, Inc.
The ITO electrodes were cleaned by sequential 10 min sonications in
Alkonox, 95% ethanol, and water twice, and finally the desired buffer.
[Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was prepared using graphene oxide (GO)
obtained from a graphite powder using a modified Hummers method.28−30

Voltammetry was carried out using a CH instrument galvanostat/potentiostat
(CHI630C) with a single-compartment voltammetric cell equipped with
the ITO working electrode (area = 0.32 cm2), a Pt wire
counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Circular dichroism
(CD) measurements were performed with a JASCO J-810 spectrometer with
temperature control at room temperature, unless otherwise specified.
Samples were freshly prepared using 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer
(SPB, pH 7.4). UV–vis measurements were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard
8453 spectrophotometer.

4.2 Preparation of DNA–rGO
To
prepare DNA–rGO materials, the solutions of oligonucleotides
and rGO of appropriate concentrations were incubated for 15–30
min at room temperature in 0.1 M SPB (pH 7.4) with 50 mM NaCl right
before each experiment.

4.3 Electrochemical Oxidation
of DNA and DNA–rGO
A buffer solution containing 50
μM Ru(bpy)32+ and oligonucleotides was
scanned at 25 mV/s from 0.0 to
1.3 V (vs Ag/AgCl). A freshly cleaned ITO electrode was used for each
experiment. Before each experiment with rGO, the DNA was mixed with
different amounts of rGO and incubated for 15–30 min. Then,
Ru(bpy)32+ (50 μM) was added right before
each measurement.

4.4 UV–Vis Measurements
A buffer
solution containing 5 μM DNA and 50 μL rGO was stirred
and incubated at room temperature for 15 min before each measurement.

4.5 Fluorescence Experiments
A buffer
solution containing 5 μM DNA and ethidium bromide was stirred
for 5 min, and then the measurements were performed. In the case of
experiments with rGO, the buffer solution containing 5 μM DNA
and 40 μL rGO was stirred for 15 min at room temperature, after
which 5 μM ethidium bromide was added. The solution was further
incubated for 5 min, and then the spectra were recorded.
