Mixed organic–inorganic
halide perovskite solar cells have
reached unprecedentedly high efficiency in a short term. Two major
challenges in its large-scale deployment is the material instability
and hazardous lead waste. Several studies have identified that lead
replacement with its other alternatives does not show the similar
assurance. In this manuscript, we introduce the concept of recycling
of the degraded perovskite film (PbI2), gaining back
the initial optoelectronic properties as the best possible solution
to avoid lead waste. The simple recycling procedure allows the utilization
of some of the most expensive (fluorine-doped tin oxide), primary
energy-consuming (TiO2), and toxic (Pb) parts of the solar
cell, reducing the payback time even further. This addresses
the major issues of instability and expensive toxic lead disposal,
altogether. We have demonstrated the comparative study of feasibility
of recycling in degraded perovskite films deposited by three different
standard fabrication routes. Films fabricated via acetate route shows
efficient recycling compared to the other routes, i.e., chloride and
sequential deposition routes. Moreover, recycling in sequentially
deposited films needs further optimization.

Introduction
In the last 5–6 years, mixed organic–inorganic
halide
perovskite materials such as methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) has been
proved to be highly efficient light harvesters with photoconversion
efficiency (PCE) exceeding 23%, comparable to other commercial technologies
such as CIGS, CdTe, and Si.1,2 This remarkable increase
in PCE of metal halide perovskite has its root in the exceptional
properties of high absorption coefficient (α = 5 × 104 cm–1 in red (1.7 eV)),3 large charge diffusion length as long as 1 μm,3,4 direct band gap of 1.55 eV at room temperature, and ambipolar charge
transport due to small and balanced effective masses of charge carrier
and high charge carrier mobilities.3−5 Easy and cheap processability
via spin coating, dip coating, and spray casting adds on to the merit.

The main hurdles to the commercialization of this technology despite
all of the benefits mentioned above is the fact that MAPbI3 is unstable when exposed to illumination, moisture, and high temperature.3,6 Experimental evidences have proved that the presence of humidity
is both beneficial and prejudicial depending on the circumstance.
A restricted amount of humidity (∼30%) has an advantageous
effect on the perovskite film properties during the crystallization
phase,7,6 improving the performance of the cell,8,6 whereas exposure to ambient environment with humidity above 50%
after crystallization has a detrimental effect on the perovskite solar
cell.9 Solving the issue of instability
and degradation can conduce the technology to outcompete in photovoltaic
marketplace.10

Another key challenge
that needs to be addressed is the toxic Pb
waste out of the damaged panels. Lead is cancerous and can disrupt
the entire ecosystem if it enters the food chain.2 The high cost of disposal of hazardous chemical waste (about
$1.10/kg) adds on to the urge to uproot its usage.2 According to Hailegnaw et al., about 30 t of Pb is required
for 1 GW solar plant.11 To resolve this
issue, researchers worldwide have been trying hard to fabricate some
efficient perovskite materials based on lead alternatives, but the
idea has not seen the light of the day. Although there are various
papers discussing about lead-free perovskite films, they fail to achieve
similar optoelectronic properties. The highest efficiency with lead
alternative is achieved using tin halide-based perovskite, which is
7%, but with even higher moisture sensitivity than MAPbI3.1212 Research
worldwide on alternatives of Pb, using Sn, and Pb–Sn alloys
had proved that complete elimination of Pb deteriorates the device
performance.13

Cost analysis of perovskite
solar cell modules with similar architecture
has shown that a major fraction (around 40–60%) of the material
embedded cost is borne by fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate.2 Owing to the high cost of FTO, researchers have
tried to derive its alternatives and found that indium tin oxide/glass,
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate can be used
but compromising the photoconversion efficiency.14 Other significant contributors to material cost are the
hole transporting material 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9’-spirobifluorene
(Spiro-OMeTAD) and gold top electrodes. According to Binek et al.,
the estimated costs of Spiro-OMeTAD and gold required are $40/m2 and $25/m2, respectively.2 Some alternatives of Spiro-OMeTAD have proven to be quite promising,
which can smoothly replace it on large-scale commercialization of
the technology.15,16 Expense of top electrodes can
also be scaled down on large-scale production as it has been proved
that there are competitive alternatives like silver that can replace
them with not much compromise with efficiency.17 Electron transport layer comprising compact titanium dioxide
(TiO2) although is not very cost-intensive, but its high-temperature
sintering (∼500 °C) consuming a large fraction of primary
energy makes it a profound consideration. If this layer can be reused
along with FTO, it serves the purpose of saving a lot of energy and
time. Production of large-scale perovskite modules also involves essential
cost of encapsulation, glass plates, interconnection busbars, sealant,
laminating film, edge-sealing frame, a junction box, and wiring.10 These, known as balance of module (BOM) components,
constitute more than 70–80% of the total module cost.10

There have been some reports on the idea
of reusing the FTO/TiO2 layer for device fabrication dissolving
the perovskite layer
completely in dimethylformamide (DMF).18,19 Xu et al.
showed a recycling study, wherein they optimized thermal decomposition
of CH3NH3PbI3 film into PbI2 on m-TiO2-based architectures and then recycled the thermally
decomposed PbI2 film back to the perovskite.20 In this manuscript, we discuss effectively the
recycling of perovskite film in which we do not scratch out the perovskite
film or dissolve anything but leave it as it is and recycle the existing
degraded perovskite film.

In this manuscript, we have shown
that by recycling the perovskite
film, we not only cut down the cost by half reducing the payback time,
but also reused lead devising it less problematic for the ecosystem.
The same lead can then be reused a number of times without loss of
its optoelectronic properties. Recycling of the same film numerous
times also reduces the cost of technology further as the same FTO
along with compact TiO2 layer can be reused without impacting
the device performance much. This will move the technology a step
ahead in the path of commercialization. Here, we study the feasibility
of recycling process in perovskite films fabricated via different
methods. It has been detected that perovskite films fabricated via
different routes have different morphologies and crystal properties
and hence different optoelectronic properties. Therefore, in this
study, to analyze the feasibility of the recovery mechanism, the perovskite
films deposited by single-step chloride, single-step acetate, and
sequential deposition routes were degraded in ambient environment
for 26 days under humidity ranging from 25 to 35%. Various structural
and optical characterizations were done to examine the nobility of
the idea. Recycling of the perovskite solar cell can also bring about
a path to reuse BOM, channelizing the technology ahead of the game.

Results
and Discussion
Degradation of MAPbI3 Perovskite
This is
a well-noted fact that sensitivity of MAPbI3 perovskite
to moisture is the biggest challenge, which needs to be urgently addressed.
Exposure to moisture and sunlight leads to the complete corrosion
of MAPbI3 into PbI2. MAPbI3 in the
presence of excess H2O dissociates into methylammonium
iodide (MAI) and PbI2 (eq 1), and then after MAI decomposes into CH3NH2 and hydroiodic acid (HI) (eq 2).21,22 On exposure to illumination
and oxygen, HI breaks down further into its constituents generating
I2 (eqs 3 and 4) 1   2   3   4  It has been documented extensively as to how
different fabrication routes lead to perovskite films with varying
optoelectronic properties and hence different device efficiencies.23 To prove the fact that the decomposition byproduct
is PbI2, degradation study of MAPbI3 films fabricated
via three different routes, i.e., single-step chloride, single-step
acetate, and sequential deposition, was conducted. The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns in Figure 1a–c show the structural changes during degradation
of the films fabricated by three different deposition routes.

Figure 1 XRD patterns
showing the degradation of (a) single-step chloride
route, (b) single-step acetate route, and (c) sequential deposition
route. (d) Crystal structure schematic showing the decomposition of
MAPbI3 into PbI2 upon exposure to humidity.

The X-ray diffraction pattern
indicates that the fresh perovskite
films in all of the three routes show the characteristic peaks at
14.13°, 28.43°, and 31.84° corresponding to the (110),
(220), and (114) lattice planes of MAPbI3.21,24,2521,24,25 The film fabricated via single-step chloride route
shows an additional low-intensity peak at 15.6°, corresponding
to the (100) plane of the MAPbCl3 phase.26−28 The formation
of MAPbCl3 intermediate phase in chloride-containing precursors
has been reported in mixed-halide MAPbI3–xClx perovskite.27 It is detected in single-step chloride film that upon exposure
to humidity, a hydrated phase is formed along with the perovskite
phase, which is corresponded by the peak at around 7.2°.29,30 On further exposure to humidity, the peak corresponding to PbI2 starts to appear at around 12.6° along with the perovskite
and hydrated perovskite peaks.31 After
prolonged exposure, perovskite and the hydrated peaks eventually disappear
leaving behind only PbI2 peak as can be ascertained from
the XRD patterns shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1b,c shows the XRD patterns for single-step acetate and sequential
deposition routes, respectively. Both of them show that on exposure
to humidity, the PbI2 peak starts to appear along with
the characteristic perovskite peak. As the time of exposure increases,
the intensity of the PbI2 peak enhances and the perovskite
peak is diminished, which ultimately disappears leaving behind just
the PbI2 peak. So, XRD analysis testifies the fact that
in around 20 days of exposure to 25–35% humidity, MAPbI3 is converted completely into PbI2.

Thought
behind recycling is that the remnant of degraded perovskite
is PbI2, which can easily be converted back into MAPbI3 on reacting it with MAI. In this study, we have established
a greater understanding on the feasibility of reverting PbI2 into MAPbI3, in terms of the optoelectronic properties
and overall morphology of the film.

Recycling of MAPbI3 Perovskite
In Figure 2, we show the schematic
representation of the entire process steps involved in the degradation
and recovery of MAPbI3 films deposited via single-step
chloride, single-step acetate, and sequential deposition routes.

Figure 2 Schematic
showing the recycling process for MAPbI3 film
deposited by (a) single-step chloride and single-step acetate route
and (b) sequential deposition route.

To study the structural changes during degradation and to
assess
the degree of recovery by recycling process, we performed various
structural and optoelectronic characterizations at different stages
of degradation and after the recycling. In Figure 3, we show the X-ray diffraction pattern comparison
of the fresh, degraded, and recycled perovskite films deposited via
single-step chloride, single-step acetate, and sequential deposition
routes.

Figure 3 XRD patterns showing the fresh deposited perovskite film, degraded
perovskite film left with PbI2, and the recycled perovskite
film for (a) single-step chloride, (b) single-step acetate, (c) sequential
deposition route, and (d) the corresponding pictures of the films
deposited by the three different routes at various stages of deposition,
degradation, and recycling.

In all three fabrication routes (i.e., single-step chloride,
single-step
acetate, and sequential deposition), upon exposure to ambient environment
and under humidity for 26 days, characteristic perovskite peaks have
diminished, while peaks pertaining to PbI2 have appeared
at around 12.6°, as ascertained from Figure 1.31 Over time,
the conversion of deep brown MAPbI3 film into a yellow
film shows that the perovskite film is now completely degraded, leaving
behind a yellow film of PbI2, as shown in Figure 3d. Experimental evidences have
already proved the degradation of MAPbI3 into PbI2 on exposure to humidity.21,32

It is evident
from Figure 3a that
the characteristic peak intensity of fresh MAPbI3 film
deposited via the single-step chloride route is quite
high, which signifies that the perovskite film is highly crystalline
and well oriented. Then, after degradation of this film into
PbI2 peaks become less intense. This clearly shows that
crystallinity is ablated upon degradation in single-step chloride
films. Contrary to this in single-step acetate, the situation is transposed
as can be seen from Figure 3b that upon exposure to humidity, peak intensity in the degraded
film is slightly increased, thereby showing enhancement in the crystallinity
of the film. XRD pattern of film deposited via sequential deposition
shown in Figure 3c
elucidates that upon exposure to ambient environment, crystallinity
of the PbI2 formed upon degradation of MAPbI3 is drastically enhanced compared to the bare PbI2 film
annealed at 70 °C. These degraded samples were then processed
through a recycling process by reacting the perovskite remains (i.e.,
PbI2) with MAI. Interestingly, on coating the solution
of MAI (10 mg/mL), the characteristic perovskite peaks reappeared
with the disappearance of PbI2 peak. For films fabricated
from single-step chloride and single-step acetate routes, the PbI2 peaks completely disappeared, confirming a complete recovery
of the respective degraded perovskite films. However, on the other
hand, in sequentially deposited films, peaks corresponding to both
MAPbI3 and PbI2 are present in recycled film
XRD pattern, indicating that PbI2 is not completely consumed
upon recycling, as seen in Figure 3c. It can also be seen in Figure 3c that there is a large amount of unconverted
PbI2 in the recycled film. It has been reported that a
small percentage of remnant PbI2 is advantageous for solar
cell as it acts like a blocking layer between TiO2 and
perovskite inhibiting backinjection and recombination of electrons.33 However, a higher amount of unconverted PbI2 is not preferable as it deteriorates the device performance.

The UV–vis absorption measurements were conducted to investigate
the optical properties of the perovskite films shown in Figure 4a–c. Optical absorption
spectra of perovskite film fabricated via all of the three routes
range from 400 to 800 nm, which is consistent with the typical absorbance
spectra of MAPbI3 reported previously.21,24 After degradation, absorption intensity between 520 to 800 nm is
observed to be decreased, whereas absorption in the range of 400 to
520 nm, which corresponds to the PbI2 absorption range
(band gap ≈ 2.4 eV) is retained.33 Interestingly, degraded perovskite films regained their lost absorption
onset to its entire range upon recycling. This is in good agreement
with the results observed from the XRD measurements. In all of the
films, the recycled film absorption baseline is slightly higher, suggesting
that the films have become coarser over the time.

(f) sequential deposition routes showing the fresh deposited perovskite
film, degraded perovskite film containing PbI2, and the
recycled perovskite film.

Steady state PL studies were carried out to assess the
photoactivity
of the perovskite films before and after recycling. Figure 4d–f shows
the PL spectra corresponding to the fresh, degraded, and recycled
perovskite films of single-step chloride, single-step acetate, and
sequential deposition routes. The signature peak of MAPbI3 perovskite is observed at around 776 nm for single-step chloride,
770 nm for single-step acetate, and 764 nm for sequential deposition.21 It is observed that the PL intensity of the
fresh perovskite film of single-step chloride is much higher than
that of single-step acetate and sequentially deposited film. Note
that the film thicknesses of all three films were maintained to a
similar range. The observed higher photoactivity of the single-step
chloride films can be attributed to large grain domains in the films
in comparison to the other two routes (single-step acetate and sequential
deposition).

In all three cases, once the perovskite films are
degraded, their
PL peak around 770 nm diminishes, corroborating the degradation of
MAPbI3 phase. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the respective
degraded films have confirmed its composition as PbI2 phase.
By the recycling process, the same degraded perovskite film (i.e.,
PbI2) is converted back to MAPbI3 phase perovskite
film. The yellowish degraded perovskite film (i.e., PbI2) eventually becomes brown/black with reappearance of the signature
PL peak at 770 nm of MAPbI3 crystal.

However, PL
peak intensity of recycled single-step chloride film
is almost negligible compared to the fresh perovskite film from the
same method. This confirms that the photoactivity of the original
perovskite film fabricated via the single-step chloride route
could not be recovered to a considerable degree after recycling. However,
the XRD patterns confirmed the recovery of MAPbI3 phase
to a great degree. This is in concordance with the highly attenuated
crystallinity of the film upon degradation, as observed from the XRD
patterns, resulting in deterioration of photoactive properties upon
recovery.

On the contrary, in the case of other two processing
routes, i.e.,
single-step acetate and sequential deposition, as we show in Figure 4e,f, the photoactivities
of the recycled films have fully recuperated to an extent of their
respective original perovskite film. Interestingly, in the case of
single-step acetate recycled film, PL emission intensity is slightly
increased and a blue shift of about 6.04 nm is observed compared to
the fresh single-step acetate film (Figure 4e). This could be due to passivation of electronic
defect states, which is again beneficial accounting for superior optoelectronic
properties.

Figure 4f shows
that the characteristic perovskite PL peak is regained on recycling
in sequential deposition case. However, the conversion of PbI2 into perovskite is not complete in this particular case,
as ascertained from XRD patterns. Despite that, the converted perovskite
is showing photoactivity comparable to the fresh film. The increase
in the crystallinity of the degraded film in sequential deposition
explicates the fact behind regaining the photoactivity.

To explore
the changes in the surface morphology of the films during
the whole mechanism of degradation and recycling, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) was carried out (Figure 5a–j). The key behind getting a highly
efficient solar cell lies in the fact that the film should be uniform
pin hole-free and with good optoelectronic properties.24,31,34

Figure 5 SEM images showing morphology of MAPbI3 perovskite film
deposited by single-step chloride route (a) fresh MAPbI3, (b) degraded film, and (c) recycled film; MAPbI3 perovskite

annealed at 70 °C, (h) fresh perovskite film deposited by
sequential deposition route, (i) degraded sequentially deposited film,
and (j) recycled sequentially deposited film.

Figure 5 shows
the
SEM images of films deposited via the three different routes at the
various stages of deposition, degradation, and recycling. In Figure 5a, we show a perovskite
film fabricated from single-step chloride method, which is pin hole-free
and with larger grain domains of sizes in the order of micrometers.
The intense PL emission that we observed in Figure 4d can be attributed to the large grain domains
in the film, which might result in lower recombination rate.7 Upon degradation of the single-step chloride
film, the grain size in the leftover PbI2 film is heavily
reduced accompanied by pin holes. This explicates grounds for the
observed decrease in crystallinity of the degraded film insured from
the XRD pattern shown in Figure 3a. This decrease in the crystallinity also accounts
for the aforementioned decrease in the PL intensity of the recycled
perovskite compared to the fresh perovskite film in single-step chloride
case. Release of H2 and I2 gases under illumination
due to decomposition of HI is one of the chemical reactions that takes
place while the degradation process in perovskite, could be the reason
for the appearance of the voids in the degraded film of single-step
chloride perovskite. Although introduction of MAI leads to transformation
of PbI2 into MAPbI3 with increased domain size
after recycling. In the case of single-step acetate, the domain
size is increased after degradation compared to the fresh perovskite
film. The aforementioned increase in the PL intensity of the recycled
single-step acetate film is probably due to enhanced crystallinity
of the degraded film (PbI2). We have also shown a comparison
of the morphology of the sequentially deposited film starting from
the very first step of PbI2 deposition to the recycled
film (Figure 5g–j).
SEM image of PbI2 film annealed at 70 °C shown in Figure 5g shows large and
diffused grains. Figure 5h depicts that upon conversion of this PbI2 film into
perovskite, the grain size is reduced, which is retained after degradation.
During this whole process, the grains in the degraded film might have
strongly oriented, which may account for the observed exceptional
increase in the crystanillity of the degraded film witnessed from
its XRD pattern (Figure 3c). It is already been constituted previously that degraded perovskite
film morphology will govern the morphology and hence the optoelectronic
properties of the recycled perovskite film. It is observed that upon
degradation, the film morphology is deteriorating in single-step chloride
and meliorating in the single-step acetate and sequentially deposited
films. Recycling is thus more efficient in single-step acetate film
without any loss in the optoelectronic property, while not much effective
in single-step chloride as the film quality is worsened to an extent
that cannot be retrieved. Similarly, sequential deposition route is
also efficient in recycling; however, converting the entire degraded
perovskite (i.e., PbI2) film has proven difficult so far.

Importance of Decomposed PbI2 Layer in Efficient
Recycling
The process of recycling is analogous to the sequential
deposition method, in which a predeposited PbI2 is converted
into perovskite films by introducing MAI.35,24 The morphology and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film
grown by sequential deposition method are dependent on the morphology
of PbI2 film to a great extent, which was already established.35 So, the feasibility of recycling will also depend
upon the morphology and crystal properties of the degraded film, i.e.,
PbI2. Therefore, it becomes critical to understand the
crystal structure changes in the degraded PbI2 films compared
to fresh PbI2.

Figure 6a shows the structural comparison of PbI2 films collected after degradation of perovskites deposited via single-step
chloride, single-step acetate, and sequential deposition routes. We
also show X-ray spectra for a fresh PbI2 film deposited
from a freshly prepared PbI2 solution in DMF deposited
by spin coating on glass substrate, followed by annealing at 70 °C
to draw a comparison with the various degraded PbI2 films. XRD
peaks at 2θ values 12.6°, 25.5°, 38.5°,
and 52.2° corresponding to the (001), (002), (003), and (004)
planes of hexagonal 2H polytype PbI2 are recorded in the
degraded films.36 Degraded single-step
chloride, single-step acetate, sequential deposition, and fresh film
PbI2 show preferred orientation along the (001) plane.36 Degraded film of single-step acetate route
shows similar crystal orientation to the fresh PbI2film
with much diminished peak intensity. In single-step acetate,
there is one additional peak at 27.85° corresponding to the (109)
plane of PbI2 (JCPDS card 73-1287). The X-ray pattern
of the degraded single-step chloride film shows peaks at 12.6°,
21.39°, 24.09°, 30.75°, 34.21°, 37.23°, 38.79°,
39.64°, and 52.47° corresponding to the (001), (005), (102),
(015), (106), (107), (003), (110) and (004) planes (JCPDS card- 73-1752),
as depicted in the crystal structure shown in Figure 6b. It can also be ascertained
from Figure 6a that PbI2 film obtained by degradation of sequentially
deposited film is the best oriented film with enhanced crystallinity
and retains an identical orientation to the fresh PbI2 film.

Figure 6 (a) Comparison
of XRD patterns of the bare PbI2 film
annealed at 70 °C with those of the degraded films of single-step
chloride, single-step acetate, and sequential deposition routes, i.e.,
PbI2 (inset: single-step chloride, single-step acetate
peaks on zoomed scale). Crystal structures of PbI2 obtained
from (b) degraded singe-step chloride film and (c) degraded single-step
acetate and sequentially deposited film.

The peak intensities in degraded single-step chloride
film
are the least among the other two, indicating a complete distortion
of the crystal structure. Also, there are many very low-intensity
peaks apparent in the XRD patterns indicating that the PbI2 film produced upon degradation of films deposited via single-step
chloride route are randomly oriented unlike single-step acetate and
sequential deposition cases, as depicted in the crystal structures
shown in Figure 6b,c.

Single-step chloride and single-step acetate routes show easy conversion
to perovskite on introduction of MAI in the degraded films, as observed
in Figure 3a,b. This
is again in good agreement with the aforementioned observations. Since
their crystallinity is greatly reduced compared to the fresh PbI2 film, it is easy to convert these films back into perovskite.
Contrary to this, crystallinity in sequentially deposited film is
enhanced enormously upon degradation compared to the fresh PbI2 film (Figure 6a). With the increased crystallinity, it becomes difficult for the
MAI to penetrate deep inside the bulk of degraded PbI2 film,
resulting in incomplete conversion into perovskite (Figure 3c). However, if this highly
crystalline film can be completely converted into perovskite, then
it can lead to greatly augmented optoelectronic properties.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that the recycling of degraded perovskite
film is possible while retaining considerable order of PL efficiency
and crystal structure. Our results show that the films deposited via
single-step acetate route can be recycled more effectively than its
single-step chloride and sequential deposition counterparts. Single-step
chloride film is deteriorated to the extent that it cannot be
recovered back to attain similar optoelectronic properties it
exhibited initially. The PL intensity of the film from the single-step
acetate route instead increased after recycling with a slight blue
shift in its peak position compared to the fresh film, which shows
rather advantageous effect on the film quality upon recycling for
this particular case. Due to tremendous enhancement in the crystallinity
of degraded PbI2 film in sequential deposition with exposure
to ambient environment, it cannot be completely transformed into MAPbI3. Some method needs to be devised for the complete conversion
of this highly crystalline PbI2 film into perovskite, as
that can lead to altogether superior grade of optoelectronic properties
than its fresh counterpart. Fabrication of solar cells by reusing
the degraded perovskite film itself will uproot the major environment
lead contamination issue and will also reduce the fabrication cost
and time, making the technology more agonistic.

Experiments and Method
Perovskite
Solution Preparation
Methylammonium Iodide (MAI) Preparation
To prepare
MAI, first, 24 mL of methyl ammine (MA 33 wt % in absolute ethanol,
Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 40 mL of ethanol (reagent grade).
Then, 10 mL of hydroiodic acid (HI, Merck, 57% in water) was slowly
added to this mixture while continuously stirring in an ice bath.
After that, the solution was crystallized by keeping it undisturbed
at 90 °C, followed by washing with diethyl ether three to four
times. This solution was then redissolved in ethanol and kept in a
refrigerator for recrystallization and subsequently dried.

Single-Step
Acetate Route
To prepare the perovskite
precursor solution, MAI and lead(II) acetate trihydrate (Pb(Ac)2·3H2O, Merck) in 3:1 molar ratio were dissolved
in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) at room temperature with a final mass
concentration of 28 wt %.

Single-Step Chloride Route
To make
the perovskite precursor
solution, MAI and lead chloride (PbCl2) were dissolved
in DMF in 3:1 molar ratio at room temperature with a final mass concentration
of 40 wt %.

Sequential Deposition Route
Lead
iodide solution (PbI2, 0.7 M) was prepared by dissolving
in DMF adding 50 μL
of HI per mL of solution under constant stirring. A solution of MAI
in propan-2-ol (IPA) (10 mg/mL) was made at room temperature.

Perovskite Deposition
Glass slides were cleaned sequentially
with labolene solution, followed by ultrasonication in deionized water,
acetone, and IPA. This was done to remove all organic impurities on
the glass slides. Single-step chloride perovskite films were deposited
by spin-coating the precursor on the glass slides at 2000 rpm for
30 s in an air-filled dry box maintaining nearly 30% relative humidity.
After spin coating, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 2.5
h.

Single-step acetate perovskite films were deposited by spin
coating the precursor on the glass slides at 2000 rpm for 30 s in
an air-filled dry box. After that, the films were left for drying
for 10 min, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min.

Sequential deposition route perovskite films were deposited by
first spin coating the precursor solution of PbI2 in DMF
at 3000 rpm for 30 s. These films were then annealed at 70 °C
for 30 min. After that, in the second step, 800 μL of MAI in
IPA (10 mg/mL) solution was spin-coated on the PbI2 film
at 2000 rpm for 60 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 40
min for the complete conversion of PbI2 into perovskite.

These MAPbI3 perovskite films fabricated via three different
routes were then left in the ambient environment for degradation to
study the feasibility of the recycling process.

Recycling
Degraded perovskite films left with PbI2 were recycled
by spin coating 800 μL of MAI in IPA
solution (10 mg/mL) at 2000 rpm for 60 s, followed by annealing at
100 °C for 40 min.

Measurement and Characterization
UV–vis absorption
measurements were conducted using a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 spectrophotometer.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a Rigaku
Ultima IV diffractometer for structural analysis at a scan speed of
8°/min and step size of 0.02° using Cu Kα target.
Photoluminescence was measured using an Agilent Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer to examine the photoactivity of the samples. Surface
morphology was observed using a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss
EVO 50 & EVO 18 Special) operating at 20 kV.
