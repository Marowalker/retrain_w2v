Here, we report flexible
thermal sensors based on organic field-effect
transistors (OFETs) that are fabricated using polymeric channel and
gate-insulating layers on flexible polymer film substrates. Poly(3-hexylthiophene)
and poly(methyl methacrylate) were used as the channel and gate-insulating
layers, respectively, whereas indium-tin oxide-coated poly(ethylene
naphthalate) films (thickness = 130 μm) were employed as the
flexible substrates. Aluminum-coated polymer films were attached on
top of the channel parts in the flexible OFETs to block any influence
by light illumination. The present flexible OFET-based thermal sensors
exhibited typical p-type transistor characteristics at a temperature
range of 25–100 °C, while the hole mobility of devices
was linearly increased with the temperature. The drain current could
be amplified at various temperatures by adjusting the gate and drain
voltages. In particular, stable sensing performances were measured
during the repeated approaching/retreating cycle with a heat source.
The flexible OFET thermal sensors attached on human fingers could
sense heat from human fingers as well as from approaching objects.

1 Introduction
Temperature
is one of the most important indicators in our daily
life because it provides useful information on environmental changes,
human body conditions, and so forth.1−3 Recently, the temperature
sensing has become crucial for the safety control of various mobile
electronic devices with rechargeable batteries such as smart watches,
smart phones, smart pads, and notebook computers.4−6 Since early
attempts for the measurement of temperature, a variety of thermal
(temperature) sensors have been invented because of the development
of the material and device technology.7−11

Thermal (temperature) sensors can be classified into two categories,
contact type and noncontact type, according to the method of temperature
measurement. The contact-type thermal sensors need to directly contact
the sensing parts to target objects, whereas the noncontact-type thermal
sensors measure the heat radiated from the objects.12−15 However, most of the conventional
thermal sensors are fabricated with metals and/or inorganic materials,
which in principle lack inherent flexibility and require high-temperature
processes, so that they have limitations as a flexible thermal sensor
for various applications in the flexible electronics era.

In
this regard, organic electronic devices are considered to be
a good approach for flexible thermal sensors because they can be fabricated
using flexible plastic film substrates at low temperatures.16−20 Of various organic electronic devices, organic field-effect transistors
(OFETs) have been widely applied for sensors and detectors because
of their advantages in signal amplification by adjusting gate voltages
in the presence of the third (gate) electrode.21−30 However, no detailed study has been so far reported on the flexible
thermal sensors based on OFETs.

In this work, we have attempted
to fabricate the flexible OFET-based
thermal sensors using 130 μm thick poly(ethylene naphthalate)
(PEN) film substrates. In particular, the present flexible OFET thermal
sensors consist of polymeric channel and gate-insulating layers, poly(3-hexylthiophene)
(P3HT) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), whereas aluminum-coated
polymer films were employed to prevent any influence of light from
the surrounding environments. The performance of the flexible OFET
thermal sensors was examined by varying the temperature of heat sources,
while their sustainability was tested through the continuous measurement
of drain current by repeating the approach of heat sources to the
channel region. The possibility of practical applications was demonstrated
by attaching the flexible OFET thermal sensors on human fingers to
measure the internal heat from the human body as well as external
heat from heat sources away from the fingers.

2 Results
and Discussion
The flexible OFET thermal sensors were fabricated
by employing
the transistor configuration of bottom-gate and top-source/drain electrodes,
as shown in Figure 1a. The PMMA gate-insulating layers were first spin-coated on the
indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated PEN substrates, followed by thermal
annealing to make a hard layer that can withstand the attack of toluene
(solvent) from the P3HT solutions during the channel layer coating
(see details in the Experimental Section).
After coating the P3HT channel layers, the source and drain electrodes
were formed by the thermal evaporation of silver in a vacuum chamber.
Finally, the aluminum-coated PEN films were attached on top of the
OFETs to block light from outside because the P3HT channel layer is
very sensitive to the light illumination.31−35 As shown in Figure 1b, the flexible OFET thermal sensors exhibited a typical
p-type transistor behavior when it comes to the output and transfer
curves. The output curves clearly showed a saturation in drain current
(ID) as the drain voltage (VD) increased negatively at a fixed gate voltage (VG). The transfer characteristics of the present
flexible devices delivered the hole mobility (μh)
of ∼7.3 × 10–3 cm2/V·s
and the threshold voltage (VTH) of 5.4
V (see Figure S1).

Figure 1 (a) Flexible OFET thermal
sensors fabricated on the ITO-coated
poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) substrate. P3HT and PMMA were used
as a channel layer (CL) and a gate-insulating layer (GIL), respectively.
The aluminum (Al)-coated PEN films were mounted on the channel layers
to avoid the influence of light (note that the heat source can approach
either the PEN side or the Al-coated PEN film side). (b) Output (left)
and transfer (right) curves of the present flexible thermal sensors
at room temperature (inset: photograph with connected wires for measurements).

The output characteristics of
devices were measured by varying
the temperature in the channel layer (see Figure 2). As the temperature increased from 25 to
100 °C, the output curve was gradually shifted toward the negative
drain current direction irrespective of gate voltages that are negatively
higher than the threshold voltage (VTH = 5.4 V in Figure 1b) (see Figure 2a).
However, the shape of the output curves was well-maintained even in
the presence of the large increase in drain current, according to
the temperature increase. This result basically indicates that the
charge transport in the channel region could be improved by the increased
temperature.36−38 In addition, it is considered that the injection
of external charge carriers was also enhanced by the improved contact
resistance between the P3HT layer and the Ag electrodes.39,40 As shown in Figure 2b (see Figure S2 for all temperatures),
the output curves were obviously shifted toward the negative drain
current direction by increasing the gate voltages when the channel
temperature was kept constant. Here, it is worthy to note that the
drain current level at the same gate voltage was gradually increased
as the temperature increased.

Figure 2 (a) Output curves according to the change in
temperature (25–100
°C) at different gate voltages (VG = 0 to −30 V). Note that ΔVG–TH denotes the difference between gate and threshold voltages to understand
the actual electric field between source and gate electrodes. (b)
Output curves according to the change in gate voltages (VG = 0 to −30 V) at a fixed temperature (25, 40,
60, 80, and 100 °C).

Then, the transfer characteristics of devices were examined
by
varying the temperature in the channel layer from 25 to 100 °C.
As shown in Figure 3a, the transfer curves were gradually shifted toward the higher drain
current direction, irrespective of drain voltages, when the temperature
in the channel layer increased. The extent of drain current increase
became more pronounced as the gate voltage increased at a constant
drain voltage. This result supports that the increased temperature
can improve the charge transport in the channel region, as discussed
above. A close investigation finds that the threshold voltage was
almost linearly increased as the temperature increased (see the inset
graphs). In particular, it is worthy to note that the shift of threshold
voltage (VTH = 6.8–9 V) was not
much affected by the drain voltage but by the temperature (see Figure S3). As observed from the transfer curves
in Figure 3b (see Figure S4 for all temperatures), the drain current
increase was steeper as the drain voltage increased negatively irrespective
of the temperature. This trend reflects that the present flexible
devices function properly at the temperature tested in this work.

Figure 3 (a) Transfer
curves according to the change in temperature (25–100
°C) at different drain voltages (VD = −5 to −30 V). Inset graphs show the change in threshold
voltage (VTH) as a function of temperature.
(b) Transfer curves according to the change in drain voltage (VD = −5 to −30 V) at a fixed temperature
(25, 40, 80, and 100 °C).

To understand the overall trend of drain current change according
to the temperature change, the drain current from both output and
transfer curves was plotted as a function of temperature in Figure 4. Interestingly,
as shown in Figure 4a, the change in drain current from the output curves was linearly
proportional to the temperature irrespective of drain voltages. However,
the slope (ratio of drain current to temperature, ΔI/ΔT) was increased (negatively) as the drain
voltage increased at a fixed gate voltage. A similar trend was measured
for the trend of drain current from the transfer curves (see Figure 4b). The higher ΔI/ΔT at higher voltages can be attributable
to a better charge transport at higher drain and gate voltages, as
given by the trend of hole mobility according to the temperature in Figure 4c. In addition, the
hole mobility was found to have a linear correlation with the temperature
(Δμh/ΔT = 2.34 ×
10–5 cm2/V·s·°C), which
may support the major role of temperature on the performance of the
present flexible devices (note that the capacitance was also linearly
increased with the temperature, as shown in Figure S5). Here, the linear dependence of hole mobility on the temperature
can be theoretically explained by the linear relationship of carrier
mobility with both the drain current and the capacitance of gate insulators
(see the charge carrier mobility equation in Figure S1).

different drain voltages (VD = −5,
−10, −20, and −30 V) at VG = −30 V. (b) Drain current as a function of temperature
according to the different gate voltages (VG = −5, −10, −20, and −30 V) at VD = −30 V. (c) Hole mobility (μh) as a function of temperature at VD = −30 V. Note that the ratio of drain current to temperature
(ΔID/ΔT)
and the ratio of mobility to temperature (Δμh/ΔT) are given in each graph.

On the basis of the detailed investigation on the
temperature-dependent
characteristics above, the performance of the present flexible OFET
thermal sensors was examined by the repeated measurement of drain
current change to the approaching heat sources (see Figure 5a). Three different temperatures
in the channel region were controlled by adjusting the power of heat
sources, while the approaching distance was fixed 0.5 cm for all cases.
As shown in Figure 5b, the drain current was increased when the heat source approached
the PEN side of the flexible OFET thermal sensors. Upon retreating
the heat source, the drain current was decreased immediately in the
presence of a relatively longer tail compared with the drain current
shape in the approaching case. The longer detail in the retreating
event can be ascribed to the heat remaining in the devices after retreating
the heat source. It is also noticeable that the drain current signals
were quite stable upon the approaching and retreating events of heat
sources irrespective of the temperature (see Figure S6 for the extended measurement). To briefly investigate the
response of the present devices, the elevated signals in Figure 5b were fitted with
a single exponential equation so as to extract the response time.
As shown in Figure S7a, the fitting was
carried out separately at around the boundary (inflection) point by
considering the approaching time (approximately 1.5 s) of heat sources.
The extracted response time was linearly decreased with temperature
for both parts (see Figure S7b). Considering
the data acquisition resolution time (ca. 200 ms) of the present measurement
system, the actual response time of approximately 50–100 ms
at 100 °C can be obtained for the present flexible OFET thermal
sensors.

Figure 5 (a) Illustration for the thermal sensing sequence by approaching
and retreating the heat source in the PEN substrate direction of the
flexible OFET thermal sensors (note that the closest distance was
set to 0.5 cm for all cases). (b) Change in drain current (VG = −5 V and VD = −5 V) at three different temperatures (channel region)
according to the thermal-sensing sequence set in (a). “A”
and “R” denote “approaching” and “retreating”,
respectively (see green arrows).

Finally, the flexible OFET thermal sensors were attached
on human
fingers to test the feasibility of monitoring body temperature as
well as surveilling (sensing) the approaching objects with heat. As
shown in Figure 6a,
the drain current was negatively increased as soon as the flexible
OFET thermal sensor attached on the finger. Interestingly, while the
flexible sensor was steadily placed on the finger, the drain current
was quite well-maintained for about 200 s. Upon removing the flexible
sensor from the finger, the drain current went back to the baseline.
Then, as shown in Figure 6b, when the heat source approached the flexible OFET thermal
sensor on the finger, the drain current was quickly increased (negatively)
from its level by the body temperature. Although the heat source did
steadily dwell near the flexible sensor for keeping 50 °C in
the channel region, the drain current was well-maintained in the presence
of marginal oscillations. Then, the drain current was quickly decreased
as soon as the heat source was retreated suddenly. It is worthy to
note that the drain current signal was greatly affected by the ambient
(room) light for the devices without the light-blocking layers when
it comes to the already increased initial current level as well as
the continuously increasing trend of the drain current (see Figure S8).

sensor attached on
a human finger (left) and the change in drain current before, during,
and after attachment (right). (b) Photograph for the temperature measurement
of a heat source approaching the flexible OFET thermal sensor attached
on a human finger (left) and the change in drain current by approaching
(0.5 cm) and retreating the heat source. The drain and gate voltages
were fixed at VD = −5 V and VG = −5 V, respectively.

3 Conclusions
The
flexible OFET thermal sensors were fabricated by coating polymeric
channel and gate-insulating layers (P3HT and PMMA) on the ITO-coated
plastic film substrates (PEN), followed by attaching the aluminum-deposited
polymer films for light blocking. The flexible devices exhibited a
typical p-type transistor behavior with a hole mobility of approximately
7.3 × 10–3 cm2/V·s. Both output
and transfer curves were gradually shifted to a (negatively) higher
drain current direction as the temperature applied increased from
25 to 100 °C, while they were obviously changed by varying the
gate and/or drain voltages even at higher temperatures. The change
in drain current and hole mobility was linearly proportional to that
of temperature. The ratio of drain current to temperature became larger
as the gate and drain voltages increased. The present flexible devices
exhibited a stable sensing performance during the repeated approaching/retreating
test with a heat source. In particular, the flexible OFET thermal
sensors attached on human fingers could sense heat from the human
fingers as well as from the approaching objects. Hence, the present
flexible OFET thermal sensors are expected to be used as a sensory
component for a variety of applications including medical instruments,
artificial skins for humanoid robots, surveillance systems, and so
forth.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
and Solutions
P3HT (weight-average
molecular weight = 30 kDa, polydispersity index = 1.7, regioregularity
> 97%) was supplied form Rieke Metals (Lincoln, NE, USA), whereas
PMMA (weight-average molecular weight = 120 kDa, polydispersity index
= 2.2) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). The P3HT powders were
dissolved in toluene (concentration = 10 mg/mL). The PMMA solutions
were prepared using chlorobenzene (concentration = 85 mg/mL). The
P3HT and PMMA solutions were vigorously stirred at 60 °C before
spin-coating.

4.2 Device Fabrication
ITO-coated PEN
substrates were patterned to make the 30 mm × 1 mm ITO stripe
as a gate electrode, followed by cleaning in acetone and isopropyl
alcohol. After drying, the ITO/PEN substrates were treated with UV–ozone
(28 mW/cm2) for 20 min. Then, the PMMA gate-insulating
layers were prepared by spin-coating the PMMA solutions, followed
by thermal annealing at 120 °C for 30 min to make them dense
for withstanding the attack of toluene (solvent) in the P3HT solutions.
Then, the P3HT channel layers were spin-coated on the PMMA layers
and further annealed at 120 °C for 15 min. These samples were
transferred into an argon-filled vacuum chamber for the deposition
of source/drain electrodes (thickness = 65 nm) through a shadow mask
in a vacuum of approximately 1 × 10–6 Torr.
The top light-blocking films were prepared by depositing aluminum
(thickness = 100 nm) on one side of 60 μm thick PEN films. Finally,
the sticky adhesive side of the Al-deposited PEN films was attached
on the channel parts of devices (see Figure 1a). A diode-type device (ITO/PMMA/Al) was
fabricated to measure the capacitance of the gate-insulating layers
(PMMA).

4.3 Measurements
The performance of transistors
was measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (model 4200SCS,
Keithley), whereas a surface profiler (Alpha-Step 200, Tencor Instruments)
was used for the measurement of the film thickness. Thermal sensing
experiments were performed using a home-built sensor measurement system
equipped with a probe station (PS-CPSN2, ModuSystems) and a heat control
part (TZ4ST, Autonics). A loadlike heat source was used and controlled
to approach the flexible OFET thermal sensors. An infrared thermometer
(62 Mini, Fluke) and a temperature-sensing unit (NI 9211, National
Instrument) were used for the measurement of accurate temperatures
near the channel region in the flexible OFET thermal sensors. The
capacitance of diode-type devices (ITO/PMMA/Al) that were placed inside
a temperature-controlled sample chamber was measured using a potentiostat
(VersaSTAT 4, AMETEK).
