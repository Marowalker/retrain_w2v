Gas-phase reactions
of atomic gold anions and small gold cluster
anions, Aun– (n = 1–4), with CH3I were investigated
to clarify the effect of the cluster size on C–I bond activation
and to elucidate the key properties of Au clusters that govern the
reactivity. AunI– identified
by mass spectrometry was observed as a common reaction product. Photoelectron
spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations revealed that
Au2I– has a linear structure in which
the I atom is bonded to Au2, and Au3I– and Au4I– take a two-dimensional structure
in which the I atom is bonded to triangular Au3 moieties.
Pseudo-first-order kinetic analyses of the reaction revealed the inverse
correlation of the reactivity of Aun– toward CH3I and the electron affinity of
Aun, indicating the reductive activation
of the C–I bond. Especially, Au2– showed the highest reactivity to form Au2I– as the main product, whereas the adduct compound Au2CH3I– was hardly formed, in sharp contrast
to the reaction of Au– reported previously. On the
basis of theoretical calculations, we propose that the reaction proceeded
dominantly via the I atom abstraction pathway (attack of Au2– from the I atom side), which is highly preferential
from the viewpoint of both the energetics and a steric factor. This
study demonstrates that not only the reactivity but also the reaction
mechanisms and products are governed by the cluster size in C–I
bond activation by Au clusters at the smallest size region.

1 Introduction
Metal
clusters exhibit size-specific chemical properties owing
to unique electronic and geometric structures,1−3 making them
promising candidates as reaction centers of innovative catalysts.3−6 Research on the reactions of bare metal clusters in the gas phase
provides a molecular-level understanding of the mechanism of how small
molecules are catalytically activated by the clusters in a size-specific
manner.7−11 For example, studies on the adsorption of O2 and CO molecules
to atomic gold or small gold cluster anions, Aun– (n = 1–3),7,8,12 have been inspired by the discovery
of CO oxidation by heterogeneous gold catalysts.13 It was clarified that only Au2– reacted with O2 to form Au2O2– at 100 K, while neither Au– nor
Au3– afforded any product ions. The size-specific
reactivity of Au2– was ascribed to the
electron transfer from Au2– to O2 because the electron affinity (EA) of Au2 (1.95
eV) is lower than that of Au (2.30 eV) and Au3 (3.84 eV).14,15 A similar mechanism was proposed for the high reactivity of larger
even- and magic-numbered Aun– clusters with an O2 molecule. Photoelectron and infrared
photodissociation spectroscopic studies on the isolated AunO2– clarified that molecular
O2 is reductively activated in a superoxo- and/or peroxo-like
forms.16−18 It was demonstrated that the catalytic CO oxidation
on bare Au2– proceeds via the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
mechanism.8 Although the above mechanism
does not explain the CO oxidation catalyzed by supported Au nanoparticles
mainly because of the difference in the environment but accounts for
aerobic oxidation reactions by negatively charged Au clusters stabilized
by an electron-donating polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone.19,20 This correspondence suggests that studies on fundamental chemical
properties of bare metal clusters will provide us with a guiding principle
for the rational design of novel catalysts.19

We previously demonstrated that atomic Au– can
activate the C–I bond of CH3I;21 the reaction of Au– and CH3I yielded AuCH3I– and AuI– as major and minor products, respectively. Photoelectron spectroscopy
and theoretical calculations revealed that two types of the adducts,
[CH3–Au–I]− and [Au–I–CH3]−, were formed by the following pathways,
respectively 1   2  

The major product [CH3–Au–I]−, corresponding to the oxidation addition product,
is formed exothermically
by the SN2 attack of Au–, followed by
the migration of leaving I– to Au (eq 1). In contrast, the minor product
[Au–I–CH3]−, corresponding
to an intermediate of I atom abstraction to form AuI–, is formed by the bonding of Au– to the I atom
of CH3I (eq 2). Branching fractions of the two pathways are determined by the
direction of Au– approaching toward CH3I.

In this study, we extended the scope of this reaction to
Au cluster
anions, Aun– (n = 1–4), to reveal how the electronic and geometric
structures of Au clusters affect the C–I bond activation. In
contrast to the case of atomic Au–, AunI– was obtained exclusively in
the reaction of Aun– with n ≥ 2. The structures of AunI– were determined by photoelectron
spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. An
inverse correlation was found between the reactivity of Aun– toward CH3I and the
EA of Aun, suggesting that the electron
transfer is involved in the C–I bond activation. Suppression
of oxidative addition in the cluster reactions was explained in terms
of steric effect. This study sheds light on the remarkable size dependence
of C(sp3)–I bond activation by Au clusters at the
smallest size region.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Mass Spectrometric Observation of Products
Figure 1a shows
a typical mass spectrum of laser-ablated Aun– (n = 1–4) before
the reaction with CH3I. Mass peaks of Aun– with n = 1–4 were
clearly observed with even–odd alternation, similar to previous
reports.22,23 With an increase in the concentration of
CH3I in the cell, the peak intensities of Aun– were gradually decreased because
of the reaction with CH3I (Figure 1b,c). On the other hand, several products
including AuCH3I– and AunI– (n = 0–4)
were generated after the reaction (Figure 1b,c). Observation of AuI– and AuCH3I– is consistent with the
previous study on the reaction of atomic Au–.21 In contrast, to the best of our knowledge, this
is the first report on the generation of AunI– with n = 2–4.
The peak intensity of Au2I– is much higher
than that of the other products, AunI– (n = 1, 3, and 4), which is consistent
with a marked decrease of Au2– as compared
to other Aun– (n = 1, 3, and 4). This correspondence indicates that AunI– is produced in the reaction
of Aun– with CH3I 3

We discuss the electronic and
geometric structures of the AunI– products in Section 2.2, followed by
the cluster size dependence of the reactivity with CH3I
in Section 2.3 and
the reaction mechanism focusing on Au2– toward CH3I in Section 2.4.

2.2 Structures of AunI– (n = 1–4)
Figure 2 compares
the photoelectron
spectra (PES) of Aun– and AunI– (n = 1–3) recorded at the photon energy of 4.66 eV.
PES of Au3I– were recorded without deceleration
because of weak intensity but that of Au4I– could not be obtained even without deceleration. The spectral profiles
of Aun– well reproduced
those of previous studies.15,23−25 The electron vertical detachment energy (VDE) for the first band
of AuI–, Au2I–, and
Au3I– was determined to be 2.25 ±
0.03 (XP1), 4.20 ± 0.02
(XP2), and 2.99 ± 0.02 eV
(XP3), respectively, by fitting
the spectra in Figure 2 with a Gaussian function. Table 1 summarizes the experimental VDE (VDEexp) values of AunI– (n = 1–3) and those of Aun– determined in a similar way. In the following,
we discuss the structural candidates of AunI– reproducing the VDEexp values with
the help of DFT calculations. Table 2 summarizes the optimized structures of AunI– (n = 1–4)
together with their spin states (2S + 1), relative energies (ΔE), binding energies (BEs) of the I atom, and theoretical
VDEs (VDEtheo).

2.2.1 AuI–
Three bands, XP1, AP1, and BP1, are observed
in the PES (Figure 2a). The VDEexp value of band XP1 (2.25 ± 0.03 eV) is comparable to that of Au– (2.31 ± 0.05 eV), as previously predicted by
a theoretical study.26 The VDE value of
AuI– is also similar to that of AuCl– (∼2.35 eV)27 reported previously,
implying that the VDEs of AuX– (X: halogen) are
comparable regardless of X. A similar phenomenon was found in AgX– (X = Cl, Br, and I); their adiabatic EAs (AEAs) are
concentrated in the range of 1.59–1.62 eV regardless of X.27 Our DFT calculation identified one structural
candidate (1-1), which gives a VDEtheo value
(2.35 eV), comparable to the experimental value (2.25 ± 0.03
eV) (Table 2). The
Au–I bond length and net charge on each atom [evaluated from
natural bond orbitals (NBO)] of 1-1 given in Table 2 reproduced those
predicted by a more accurate calculation using the CCSD(T) method.26 This assignment is further supported by the
vibrational spacing (26 ± 5 meV) observed in the PES recorded
with a 532 nm laser (inset of Figure 2a), which agrees well with that theoretically calculated
for 1-1 (24.5 meV). Bands AP1 and BP1 are probably
associated with electron detachment from 1-1 to form
neutral AuI in electronically excited states; exploration of the excited
states of 1-1 is beyond the scope of the current study,
which would require precise treatments of spin–orbit coupling
effects.28,29

2.2.2 Au2I–
Two bands, XP2 and AP2, are observed in the PES (Figure 2b). The VDEexp of
band XP2 (4.20 ± 0.02 eV)
is remarkably larger than that of Au2– (1.98 ± 0.05 eV), in sharp contrast to the small difference
in the VDE values of Au– and AuI– (ΔVDEexp = −0.07 eV). Our DFT calculations
gave three optimized structures (Table 2): two linear structures in a singlet spin state (2-1 and 2-2) and one triangle structure in a
triplet spin state (2-3). The I atom is attached to a
Au2 unit in 2-1, whereas it is inserted into
the Au–Au bond in 2-2. The structure of 2-2 agrees well with that reported previously by Li.30 Based on the ΔE and VDE
values calculated for the three isomers (Table 2), band XP2 was assigned to the most stable isomer, 2-1.
The high stability of 2-1 is associated with the ionic
nature of the Au–I bond as revealed by the NBO charges (Table 2). The much larger
VDE value of Au2I– as compared with that
of Au2– is attributed to the hybridization
of the 6s and 5d orbitals of Au atoms as revealed by the analysis
of the Kohn–Sham orbitals (Figure S1). Band AP2 observed at ∼4.45
eV with a vibrational spacing of 24 ± 1 meV (inset of Figure 2b) is not assigned
to another isomer but is associated with the photodetachment from 2-1 to the corresponding neutral species in an electronically
excited state because isomers 2-2 and 2-3 are significantly less stable than 2-1 and their VDEtheo values are much smaller than the VDEexp values.

2.2.3 Au3I–
The
PES exhibited two bands, XP3 and AP3. The VDEexp of band XP3 (2.99 ± 0.02
eV) is significantly smaller than that of Au3– (3.87 ± 0.02 eV), in sharp contrast to the behavior found in
AuI– and Au2I–. Four
optimized structures in a doublet spin state were obtained as shown
in Table 2. The most
stable isomer, 3-1, is constructed by the bonding of
an I atom to one of the Au atoms of an equilateral triangular Au3 moiety. The second most stable isomer, 3-2,
is constructed by the bonding of an I atom to a terminal Au atom of
a slightly bent Au3 chain. The stabilities of 3-1 and 3-2 are comparable within our level of calculation.
In the third isomer, 3-3, a Au atom and Au2 unit are bonded to a single I atom to form a bent structure. In
the least stable isomer, 3-4, an I atom is bonded to
the central Au atom of a bent Au3 chain. From a comparison
of VDE values, it is most plausible to assign band XP3 to 3-1. Interestingly, the PES
data exclude the possibility of the formation of 3-2 even
though it is energetically comparable to 3-1, and the
Au3 moiety of 3-2 has a similar structure
to that of the reactant Au3– (D∞h symmetry).31 Band AP3 was tentatively assigned to electron detachment from 3-1 to form the corresponding neutral Au3I in an electronically
excited state because the VDEtheo values of the other isomers
cannot explain the band position.

2.2.4 Au4I–
Because the PES could not be
recorded, we considered the structures
based solely on DFT calculations. Four stable structures are shown
in Table 2. The first
and second most stable structures, 4-1 and 4-2, are constructed by adding one Au atom to 3-1 and 3-3, respectively. The large VDE values (>∼4.3 eV)
for 4-1 and 4-2 are consistent with the
insufficient PES signals at 4.66 eV. Thus, structure 4-1 and/or 4-2 are the most probable candidates for Au4I–.

2.3 Size
Dependence in Reactivity of Aun– (n = 1–4)
As discussed in Section 2.1, the intensity
of the mass peak of Au2– decreased in
the reaction more prominently than those of Aun– (n =
1, 3, and 4), which implies that Au2– is the most reactive among them. Because the pressure of CH3I (P(CH3I)) is significantly higher
than that of Aun– (P(Aun–)) in
our experimental conditions, the reactions can be treated as a pseudo-first-order
reaction with respect to P(Aun–), where P(CH3I) is regarded as a constant during the reaction. Then, the rate
constants of Aun– (kn) are given as follows 4  where P0(Aun–) and P(Aun–) represent the
pressures of Aun– before
and after the reaction, respectively, and t represents
the reaction time. The values of P0(Aun–) and P(Aun–) were determined
based on the intensities of the mass peaks of Aun–. If we further assume that t is independent of P(CH3I) and n, the kn values
can be estimated from the slopes of the plots of ln(P(Aun–)/P0(Aun–))
versus P(CH3I) according to eq 4 (Figure S2). Figure 3a shows
the relative rate constants thus obtained with a reference to k2. As expected, k2 is the largest among kn (n = 1–4), which indicates the highest reactivity
of Au2–. In contrast, Au3– shows the lowest reactivity; the chemical inertness
of Au3– is further confirmed by the presence
of Au3– even in the reaction with an
excess amount of CH3I, while Au–, Au2–, and Au4– were totally consumed (Figure S3). Figure 3b shows the AEAs
of Aun (n = 1–4)
reported in literature studies.14,15 A clear inverse correlation
between kn and EA was
observed: Au atoms/clusters with low EA show high reactivity toward
CH3I, and vice versa, when they are negatively charged.
This correlation is similar to that observed in the reactions between
Aun– and an O2 molecule.7,8,19 Therefore,
we conclude that the reaction between Aun– and CH3I proceeds via reductive activation
of the C–I bond of CH3I; it is well known that CH3I undergoes dissociative electron attachment to form I– and CH3.32 Electron
transfer from Aun– to
CH3I is supported by the smaller negative charge on the
Aun core of AunI– (−0.37|e| to −0.54|e|) compared to that of the reactants Aun– (−1.0|e|).

2.4 Reaction Mechanism
2.4.1 I Atom
Abstraction
In the reaction
of Aun– (n = 2–4) with CH3I, I atom-abstracted products AunI– were observed as the
sole products via eq 3. However, the adduct products [Aun–I–CH3]− corresponding to the intermediates were
not detected (Figure 1b,c), in contrast to the detection of [Au–I–CH3]− in the reaction with Au–. To explain the reason for this difference, we theoretically studied
the reaction mechanism of I atom abstraction by using Au2– as an example. First, we could not obtain any
optimized structures for [Au2–I–CH3]− despite an intensive survey of the initial structures
at our calculation level [B3LYP/LanL2dz (Au, I), 6-31+G(d,p) (C, H)].
Then, we examined the profile of the potential energy surface of [Au2···I···CH3]− in a colinear configuration as defined in Figure 4a. The I–C–H angles, C–H
distances, Au–Au distance, and orientation of the Au2 unit were optimized at every distance of Au2–I
(R(Au2–I)) and C–I (R(C–I)) in the calculation. Figure S4a,b shows the three-dimensional plot of the potential energies
and the contour plot of the energy surface as a function of R(Au2–I) and R(C–I),
respectively. Figure 4b shows the contour plot in mass-weighted coordinates, Q1 and Q2, defined in eqs 5 and 6, respectively 5   6  where mAu2, mI, and mCH3 represent
the masses of Au2, I, and
CH3, respectively. In the mass-weighted coordinates (Q1, Q2), the original
coordinates (R(Au2–I), R(C–I)) are shown as skew coordinates with the skew
angle θ represented in eq 7. 7  

Figure 4 (a) Colinear configuration of [Au2···I···CH3]− with the definition of R(Au2–I)
and R(C–I). (b)
Contour plot of the potential energy surface represented in mass-weighted
coordinates (Q1 and Q2). Contours are shown for every 0.1 eV. The lower right
and the upper left of the panel correspond to the reactant (Au2– + ICH3) and the product (Au2I– + CH3), respectively. The
black dotted line is an eye guide for indicating the minimum energy
path. The calculation was performed at the B3LYP/LanL2dz (Au, I),
6-31+G(d,p) (C, H) level without vibrational zero-point energy corrections.

The skew angle θ in this
system is 73.6°, which is close
to 90° and is typical for “light-heavy-heavy” reacting
systems. In Figure 4b, no stationary point is found and the minimum energy path directly
connects the reactant (Au2– + CH3I) and the product (Au2I– + CH3). This energy profile implies that Au2– + CH3I can be converted to Au2I– + CH3 without any barrier if Au2– approaches CH3I from the I side. This pathway is not
only barrierless but is also highly exothermic (0.91 eV, Figure 5) because of the
closed electron configuration of Au2I–, in sharp contrast to the endothermic process in the reaction of
Au– to form AuI– (eq 2).21 The
exothermicity for the formation of Au2I– + CH3 was calculated to be comparable (0.90 eV) by taking
into account the dispersion correction using the B3LYP-D3 functional.33 The energetics are consistent with the experimental
results where Au2I– was abundantly produced
(Figure 1b,c). Based
on these results, we propose that Au2– preferentially reacts with CH3I in the I atom abstraction
pathway to form Au2I–. Probably, the
reaction K + CH3I → KI + CH3 is the representative
I atom abstraction reactions extensively studied using the crossed
molecular beam technique: K abstracts I from CH3I via backward
scattering.34,35 The empirical potential energy
surface calculated for the K–I–CH3 system
showed large exothermicity (∼0.9 eV), an almost negligible
activation barrier (∼0.1 eV), and no existence of a “collision
complex” along the I atom abstraction pathway,36,37 as is the case for the present study.

(C, H) level. Color codes: yellow = Au, purple = I, gray = C, and
white = H.

2.4.2 Oxidative
Addition
In the reaction
of Aun– (n = 2–4) with CH3I, the oxidative addition products
[CH3–Aun–I]− were not detected (Figure 1b,c), in contrast to the detection of [CH3–Au–I]− (eq 1) in the reaction with Au–. To explain the reason for this difference, we theoretically studied
the reaction mechanism of oxidative addition by using Au2– as an example. In the reaction of atomic Au–, [CH3–Au–I]− is formed by the SN2 attack of Au– on
the methyl side of CH3I, followed by the migration of leaving
I– to Au (eq 1).21Figure 5 shows the calculated energy profiles along
the intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRCs) for the reaction of Au2– and CH3I using the B3LYP functional,
where a similar SN2 mechanism to form [CH3–Au2–I]− was assumed. Table S1 summarizes the structural details (bond distances
and NBO charges) of each intermediate. The relative energies and structures
of the intermediates were not affected significantly by taking into
account the dispersion correction using the B3LYP-D3 functional,33 as shown in Table S2. At the beginning, CH3I is electrostatically bound to
Au2– by the charge–dipole interaction
([Au2–···CH3I]), and Au2– attacks CH3I from the CH3 group to afford [Au2CH3···I–]. Then, I– migrates to the Au2 side to form [CH3–Au2–I]−. The oxidative addition product
[CH3–Au2–I]− has two isomers: one has CH3 and I ligands on one of
the two Au atoms (ΔE = −1.51 eV) and
the other has two ligands on individual Au atoms (ΔE = −1.73 eV), as shown in Figure 5. These two isomers can be transformed to
each other via a single transition-state (TS) structure. The overall
potential energy profile for the oxidative addition pathway was energetically
downhill from the reactant (Au2– + CH3I). This profile implies that the oxidative addition product
[CH3–Au2–I]− should be easily formed once the SN2 step proceeds. However,
almost no type of adducts including [CH3–Au2–I]− was observed in the experiment
as mentioned above (Figures 1b,c and S3). One possible explanation for this discrepancy
is that [CH3–Au2–I]− once formed inevitably dissociates into Au2I– and CH3 before the mass analysis. If this is the case,
the formation of Au2I– will be suppressed
in the reaction with bulky haloalkanes. However, the reaction with t-C4H9I yielded as much Au2I– as the reaction with CH3I (Figure S5). Another plausible explanation would
be a steric factor arising from the anisotropic structures of the
reactants Au2– and CH3I. In
order for the SN2 reaction to take place, Au2– should approach CH3I from a small
core angle of the CH3 group with a configuration in which
the Au–Au axis is parallel to the C–I bond. Thus, the
predominant branching to I atom abstraction over the SN2 pathway is ascribed to the much larger frequency factor for the
former reaction.

3 Summary
Gas-phase
reactions of CH3I with Au atom/cluster anions
Aun– (n = 1–4) were investigated using mass spectrometry, photoelectron
spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. AunI– were identified as common products. The most
probable structures of AunI– were proposed based on the VDE values and relative stabilities:
a linear structure for Au2I– in which
the I atom is bonded to Au2; two-dimensional structures
for Au3I– and Au4I– in which the I atom is bonded to triangular Au3 moieties.
Au2– showed higher reactivity than the
clusters with other sizes (n = 1, 3, and 4), based
on pseudo-first-order kinetics, to afford Au2I– as a major product. The size dependence of the reactivity is correlated
with the EA of the Au clusters, indicating that reductive activation
is the key to the production of AunI–. The adduct species AunCH3I– was hardly observed, in sharp
contrast to our previous report on the reaction of Au–.21 Based on the theoretical surveys of
possible mechanisms for Au2– as an example,
we concluded that the reaction probability is small for the SN2 attack on CH3I but is rather large for the I
atom abstraction pathway to form Au2I– and CH3 radicals as a neutral product. The difference
in the branching fractions between Au– and Au2– is explained by the following two factors:
(1) a barrierless feature and high exothermicity for the I atom abstraction
pathway by Au2– and (2) quenching of
the SN2 pathway for Au2– due
to a steric hindrance, which are not the case in the reaction of Au–. The present study reveals the remarkable size dependency
in the C–I bond activation by Au clusters at the smallest size
region and raises the possibility that Au clusters can be used as
catalysts that can control the products or can enhance the selectivity,
by precise tuning of the cluster size at the atomic level.

4 Methods
4.1 Experimental Section
The experimental
apparatus used in this study consists of a laser ablation ion source,
a reaction cell, a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and a magnetic
bottle-type photoelectron spectrometer (MB-PES). Details are described
elsewhere.21,38 Briefly, the Au atom/cluster
anions Aun– (n = 1–4) were generated by irradiating a target Au
rod with a focused second harmonic output from a Nd:YAG laser operated
at 10 Hz (Spectra-Physics, INDI-40-10-HG). To efficiently produce
the cluster anions (n ≥ 2), we reduced the
laser power (typically 3–4 mJ/pulse) and used a fresh surface
of the as-purchased Au rod. The generated ions were carried by pulsed
helium gas with a backing pressure of 4.5–6.0 atm. Then, the
ions were guided into a reaction cell and were allowed to react with
a pulsed gas mixture of CH3I (1–5%)/He with a backing
pressure of 0.8–1.2 atm. The flow rate of the reaction gas
was finely tuned by a metering valve.

After the reaction, the
anionic species were extracted perpendicularly to the initial beam
direction, accelerated up to 3.0 keV, and analyzed by a linear time-of-flight
mass spectrometer (length = 1.59 m). The product anions of interest
were further studied by photoelectron spectroscopy. The mass-selected
target anion was decelerated and irradiated with second (532 nm, 2.33
eV) or fourth (266 nm, 4.66 eV) harmonic output (<0.5 mJ/pulse)
from a Nd:YAG laser (Spectra-Physics, INDI-40-20-HG). Kinetic energies
of the photoelectrons were measured by a MB-PES (length = 1.47 m)
and calibrated by known photoelectron peaks of Au– and I–.14,39 Photoelectron signals
were accumulated for 10 000–60 000 laser shots
after background subtraction. The energy resolution of the MB-PES
was ∼50 meV for electrons with a kinetic energy of 1.0 eV.

4.2 Computational Section
Electronic
and geometrical structures of the detected species and possible intermediates
were studied by DFT calculations using the Gaussian 09 program.40 The hybrid functional B3LYP was used, which
has ever been used for several gold-alkyl halide systems.21,38,41−43 Basis sets
used were aug-cc-pVTZ-PP for Au and I atoms and aug-cc-pVTZ for C
and H atoms (from the EMSL Basis Set Exchange Database)44,45 for the structural determination of AunI– products (Section 2.2), whereas LanL2dz (Au, I) and 6-31+G(d,p)
(C, H) were used for the discussion on reaction mechanisms (Section 2.4) because of
the computational costs. Structural optimization was carried out followed
by frequency calculations to check whether the optimized structure
was located at the local minimum (LM) of the potential energy surface.
Total electronic energy of each structure is shown after the vibrational
zero-point energy correction, unless otherwise noted. Atomic charges
were evaluated by natural population analysis based on NBOs. To compare
the calculated structures with the experimental PES, VDEtheo values of each LM structure were calculated as the energy difference
between the ground state of an anion and that of the neutral species,
while the structures were fixed at anion’s ground state.

To acquire insight into the reaction mechanisms, TS structures and
IRCs were explored using the Gaussian 0940 and GRRM11/14 programs.46−49 In the calculation of potential energy surfaces as
a function of the selected interatomic distances (Section 2.4), the Z-matrix coordinates were used instead of the redundant internal coordinates
both for the design of the initial molecular structures and for structural
optimization. The selected distances were scanned at 0.1 Å intervals,
whereas other coordinates were optimized at every distance.
