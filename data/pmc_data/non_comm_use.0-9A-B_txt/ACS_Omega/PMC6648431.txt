Superparamagnetic
iron oxide nanoparticles were developed as positron
emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) bimodal
imaging agents. These nanoparticles (NPs), with a specific nanoflower
morphology, were first synthesized and simultaneously functionalized
with 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (LDOPA) under continuous
hydrothermal conditions. The resulting NPs exhibited a low hydrodynamic
size of 90 ± 2 nm. The functional groups of LDOPA (−NH2 and −COOH) were successfully used for the grafting
of molecules of interest in a second step. The nanostructures were
modified by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and a new macrocyclic chelator
MANOTA for further 64Cu radiolabeling for PET imaging.
The functionalized NPs showed promising bimodal (PET and MRI) imaging
capability with high r2 and r2* (T2 and T2* relaxivities) values and good stability. They were
mainly uptaken from liver and kidneys. No cytotoxicity effect was
observed. These NPs appear as a good candidate for bimodal tracers
in PET/MRI.

1 Introduction
Magnetic
iron oxide NPs have received huge attention in biomedical
applications such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),1,2 hyperthermia,3 and drug delivery.4 In particular, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
(SPIONs) are widely used as in vivo transverse relaxation (T2 and T2*) contrast
agents in molecular and cell imaging to differentiate diseased from
healthy tissues.5

However, since
each imaging modality possesses its own strengths
and weaknesses, one single imaging technique is often not enough to
evaluate the biological structure properties and information concerning
a pathology or an injury with accuracy and in real time.6 More particularly, MRI has low sensitivity and
is not appropriate for molecular imaging.5 To overcome these drawbacks, multimodal imaging approaches, combining
MRI with a complementary imaging technique, such as positron emission
tomography (PET), are very interesting. Indeed, such a strategy allows
to apply an effective treatment as soon as possible. In one step,
the mechanisms of pathologies are indicated. A rapid, specific, and
appropriate treatment can be consequently applied on the patient.7

Magnetic iron oxide NPs are nowadays used
as potential multimodal
imaging probes7−10 such as PET/MRI,6 MRI/ultrasound (US),11 MRI/computed tomography (CT),12 or PET/near-infrared fluorescence/MRI.13 It can be highly beneficial to combine PET with MRI. PET
is highly sensitive and particularly well suited for molecular imaging.5,7 The simultaneous use of MRI and PET imaging leads to high spatial
resolution, high sensitivity, high technical maturity, and low radiation
doses.6,9 Thus, a radiolabeled MRI probe such as radiolabeled
SPIONs may show great potential as an innovative, powerful, and promising
tool to enhance the noninvasive diagnosis and treatment of patients.

Iron oxide NPs have been studied and modified to develop multifunctional
contrast agents with high biocompatibility and stability over a wide
range of pH.2,13 They should satisfy several requirements
such as a good long-term stability, a high efficiency for imaging
or drug delivery, and nonspecific interactions between the NP surface
and the biological media. Many strategies have been developed to improve
these characteristics. They consist in the grafting of electrostatic
and/or steric agents on the surface of the NPs.14−23 Some studies reported that catechol derivatives such as LDOPA,24 dopamine,25 and nitrodopamine26 have a strong affinity to metal oxides and can
be used as a platform to graft other molecules such as poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) and acyclic chelators, owing to their multiple functional
groups (−NH2, −COOH, −OH).22,27−29 Macrocyclic bifunctional chelating agents can also
be advantageously used because they form more stable complexes with
radiometals used for PET imaging, thus preventing transchelation or
transmetallation phenomenon.30 Different
shapes and sizes of macrocycles are used to complex various metallic
radioisotopes such as 64Cu2+, 67/68Ga3+, 111In3+, etc. For examples,
the most widely used macrocyclic derivatives are those of the 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic
acid and the one of 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid known
as DOTA and NOTA respectively. However, only a few PET/MRI bimodal
imaging contrast agents based on iron oxide NPs have been developed.6,13,21,31−36 Patel et al. reported a PET/MRI imaging contrast agent using iron
oxide NPs coated with DOTA to chelate Cu2+.6 Lee et al. developed a tumor-specific iron oxide probe
for early clinical tumor detection using PET/MRI multimodal imaging.34 More recently, Rosales et al. used a different
strategy by developing functionalized bimodal PET/MRI NPs including
molecules containing dithiocarbamate groups (sulfur derivatives of
carbamate functions) aiming at the chelation of 64Cu.31 This radioactive isotope is a very good candidate
for PET imaging owing to its 12.7 h half-life, which allows to record
images and until 24 h after injection.37−42

In our study, we aimed to develop for the first time a dual
PET/MRI
imaging nanoprobe based on SPIONs initially synthesized and modified
by LDOPA under continuous hydrothermal conditions. In a second step,
NPs were conjugated with PEG (MW = 2000 Da) and to a promising macrocyclic
chelator 2,2,2-(2-{[2-(4-isothiocyanatophenyl)acetamido]methyl}-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triyl)triacetic
acid (p-NCS-Bz-MANOTA) to complex 64Cu2+.42 MANOTA appeared recently as
a very good candidate for copper-64 radiolabeling of antibody fragments.43 The use of optimized chelators of 64Cu2+ is crucial because recent studies have shown that
Cu(II)–DOTA or 1,8-N,N′-bis-(carboxymethyl)-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane
complexes can undergo metal release in vivo and high accumulation
in kidneys and liver.38−40,44,45 In vivo applications of iron oxide NPs synthesized using a continuous
hydrothermal process, functionalized with p-NCS-Bz-MANOTA
on their surface, have not been reported yet. The resulting bimodal
agents showed a significant stability in suspension, no cytotoxicity
(in vitro tests) on liver cells (HepG2 cells), and a high contrast
on mouse imaging (PET and MRI), highlighting the high potential of
these systems for PET/MRI future bimodal applications.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemical Characterization
of the Functionalized
NPs
2.1.1 Fe3O4–LDOPA
NPs Synthesized by the Hydrothermal Continuous Process
The
Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs synthesized by continuous
hydrothermal process have been investigated. The (220), (311), (222),
(400), (422), (511), and (440) planes on X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern46 (Figure 1a) and A1g transition47 observed in the Raman spectrum (Figure 1b) indicate the cubic inverse spinel structure
of magnetite (Fe3O4, ICDD: 19-0629). Moreover,
in the Raman spectra, maghemite peak at 720 cm–1, which corresponds to a partial oxidation of NPs, is not observed.48 The lattice parameter determined from the XRD
results is a = 8.396 ± 0.003 Å and confirms
that Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs obtained by this
continuous process are nonoxidized. Fe3O4–LDOPA
NPs exhibit a specific nanoflower structure (Figure 1c) as described in previous reports.49,50 Briefly, these nanoflowers (small aggregates) are composed of small
crystallites (ØXRD = 14.9 ± 0.3 nm
in Figure 1a) organized
in a flower-shaped aggregate structure with a mean size of 39 ± 12
nm (Figure 1d).

(b) Raman spectra, (c) transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image, and (d) TEM diameter distribution of Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs.

LDOPA ligands on the surface of NPs are detected by IR spectroscopy.
The characteristic vibrations at 1485 cm–1 (ν(CC)
of the benzene ring),51 1590 cm–1 (COO– groups),52 and
1345 cm–1 (ν(CC) and ν(CO))51 confirm the grafting of LDOPA on the surface
of NPs (Figure 2).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements confirm also the
grafting of LDOPA on the surface of iron oxide NPs (Figure 3a). As previously reported,49 the characteristic peaks of LDOPA are observed
on C 1s (π → π* contribution at 291.4 eV and COOH
contribution at 288.3 eV) and on N 1s (NH2 group, 399.7
eV) levels.

Figure 2 Fourier transform infrared spectra collected from 4000 to 750 cm–1 on Fe3O4–LDOPA, Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG, and Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA NPs.

Figure 3 XPS spectra of curve-fitted C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s peaks
recorded
on (a) Fe3O4–LDOPA, (b) Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG, and (c) Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA NPs.

2.1.2 Functionalized Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG and Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs
The different functionalizations were analyzed thanks
to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to characterize the grafting ratio
of PEG and MANOTA at the surface of SPIONs–LDOPA (Figure S1). Mass losses increased as additional
organic moieties were added at each successive step of grafting leading
to 2.49 LDOPA, 0.07 PEG2000, and 0.04 MANOTA nm–2 on the surface of SPIONs. The details of the equation
are given in Figure S2. It should be noted
that the specific surface area of SPIONs–LDOPA was (SBET = 147 ± 2 m2 g–1). It was considered that SBET remained
the same for all following steps.

XPS measurements indicate
an evolution of C 1s, O 1s, and N 1s contribution when samples are
modified by PEG and MANOTA, as can been seen in Figure 3. The π → π* contribution
of C 1s peak concerning the Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG
NPs disappeared (Figure 3b). It can be explained by the new layer of PEG around the nanoparticle.53 Moreover, the proportion corresponding to COH/COC/CN
groups of C 1s level improves from 30% for the Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs to 46% for the Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG NPs as the O–C contribution of O
1s level from 4% for Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs
to 12% for Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG NPs.
These observations are attributed to the large number of COC groups
in PEG (MW: 2000 Da). Furthermore, the O2– contribution
(structure oxygen from NPs) of O 1s level and COOH contribution of
C 1s level decrease for Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG
NPs compared to Fe3O4–LDOPA. Finally,
a shift of binding energies concerning COOH and O–C contributions
of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG NPs compared
to Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs are observed. These
shifts to low binding energy are equal to 0.2 and 0.7 eV (COOH and
OC, respectively). The COOH shift indicates a modification of the
electronic environment around this group. It is due to the covalent
linkage between COOH of LDOPA and NH2 of MeO–PEG–NH2. The last shift comes from the large number of COC in PEG.
The N 1s contribution is not modified for Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG sample because the NH2 group
of LDOPA is not again modified. These results confirm that a PEG organic
shell covers the NPs surface.

Some changes in the Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
sample are also observed (Figure 3c). The COH/COC/CN proportion increases from 46% (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG NPs) to 55% for (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA NPs).
The COOH contribution also increases from 18% (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG NPs) to 21% (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA NPs). These observations come from the large number of COOH groups and
CN bonds in MANOTA derivatives. The O–C and O=C–OH/OH
proportions concerning the O 1s level increase as well. They increase
from 33% (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG NPs)
to 49% (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs) and from 12% (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG
NPs) to 25% (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs). It is due to the COOH groups of MANOTA-NCS and confirms the
presence of the chelator on the surface of NPs. Moreover, the O2– contribution decreases to 26% for Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA NPs. The COOH contribution
of the C 1s level is modified. A shift to high binding energies from
288.1 eV (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG
NPs) to 288.4 eV (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs) is observed. A shift to low binding energies of the O−C
contribution is also highlighted in the O 1s level, showing a decrease
from 532.5 eV for Fe3O4−LDOPA−PEG
NPs to 532.0 eV for Fe3O4−LDOPA−PEG−MANOTA
NPs This can be explained by the CO groups of MANOTA. Finally, we
also observed a modification of the N 1s level: after the conjugation
of p-NCS-Bz-MANOTA with the NH2 group
of LDOPA, a slight shift to high binding energies is observed. This
increase from 399.7 eV (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG
NPs) to 400.0 eV (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs) can be attributed to the CN contributions of MANOTA cycles, which
have similar (cyclic) structure to other polyazamacrocycles for which
similar behavior has already been observed in literature.54 XPS data confirm the grafting of p-NCS-Bz-MANOTA on the NPs surface (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG).
These results show that NH2 and COOH groups of LDOPA (after
the continuous hydrothermal synthesis of magnetite NPs) are free and
available for grafting other molecules, like in this case PEG and
MANOTA, both present on the surface of NPs.

In the IR spectra
of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG
and Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs, new vibration bands are observed compared to that of Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs (Figure 2). The vibrations at 2960, 2920, and 2890
cm–1 correspond to the asymmetric stretching of
CH2, stretching of CH (CH, symmetric CH3), and
symmetric stretching of CH2 groups from PEG, respectively.55 The bands at 1105 and 1050 cm–1 are assigned to ether asymmetric stretching.55,56 The CN, CO, and CC bonds, which compose MANOTA, have the same vibration
bands as PEG. The vibration bands of LDOPA are also kept after the
grafting of PEG and MANOTA on the surface of NPs. The IR spectroscopy
also confirms the grafting of PEG and MANOTA on the NPs’ surface.

The ζ-potential measurements (Figure 4) also confirm the grafting of PEG and MANOTA.
Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs indicate an isoelectric
point (IEP) of 2.8 and a ζ-potential of −30 mV at physiological
pH (pH = 7.4). A screening of the ζ-potential and a shift of
the IEP are observed when the NPs are functionalized by PEG. The IEP
and the ζ-potential at physiological pH of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG NPs are pH 6 and −8 mV, respectively.
This screening is due to the presence of PEG on the NPs surface; the
absence of charge on this polymer and the presence of covalent bond
between the COO– terminal group of LDOPA and the
NH2 terminal group of MeO–PEG–NH2 contribute to this effect. This new bond tends to modify and more
precisely cancels the electronic charges on the COO– of LDOPA. The latter is corroborated by the new IEP and confirms
this grafting. The IEP is shifted to 9.1 (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA NPs) due to the presence of
MANOTA molecules. The ζ-potential range of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA is the same as that
of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG. These results
confirm the grafting of MANOTA on the NPs’ surface.

Figure 4 Zetametry of
Fe3O4–LDOPA, Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG, and Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs.

IR spectroscopy, XPS, and ζ-potential
measurements prove
that the NH2 groups and COO– of LDOPA
of Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs, which are synthesized
by a hydrothermal synthesis, are available and active for the grafting
of PEG and p-NCS-Bz-MANOTA.

Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurements reveal a shift of the
hydrodynamic diameter of the NPs in Figure 5. More precisely, a slight increase of the
hydrodynamic diameter is observed from 90 ± 2 nm (Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs) to 119 ± 6 nm (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA NPs). The hydrodynamic
size does not increase significantly after the grafting of MANOTA.
This observation suggests that there is no cross-linking between NPs
from carboxyl groups of MANOTA. Grafted PEG molecules participate
in the prevention of this phenomenon by a steric effect. The organic
layer surrounding the metal oxide increases upon grafting of PEG and
MANOTA on the surface of NPs: PEG contributes to a steric hindrance
around the NPs. Consequently, this layer extends the hydrodynamic
diameter. Moreover, the average hydrodynamic size is under 200 nm,
which is efficient for nanoprobe delivery.57 Moreover, the colloidal stability of SPIONs–LDOPA–PEG2000 NPs has been evaluated in several media. The hydrodynamic
diameters are as follows: NaCl 10–2 M (95 ± 2
nm), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1× (115 ± 4 nm),
minimal essential medium (MEM, 106 ± 1 nm), and albumin 60 mg
mL–1, 24 h at 37 °C (120 ± 2 nm). We can
see that the hydrodynamic size remains almost the same whatever the
conditions.

Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs in PBS (0.1 M).

2.2 In Vitro
Cytotoxicity Test
The cytotoxicity
of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs is evaluated on HepG2 liver cells (Figure 6), which are exposed to a wide range of NPs
concentrations from 2.34 to 300 μgFe3O4 mL–1. Positive cells exposed to a toxic
agent (sodium dodecyl sulfate 3%) and negative controls (without exposition)
are realized. Whatever the NPs concentration, the cell viability is
approximately 80–90%, which is not statistically different
from the negative control. Indeed, we evaluate with this test a high
concentration of NPs (until 300 μg mL–1) compared
to those mentioned in the reported literature.58,59 No dose effect is observed in the present study. The mitochondrial
enzymatic activity of HepG2 cells is maintained when they are exposed
to the functionalized NPs during 24 h. Thanks to these results, an
in vivo evaluation of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs on animals (mice) was performed.

assay after exposure

24 h. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (three
independent experiments). Statistical difference was checked using
a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Dunnett test
(p < 0.05).

2.3 In Vivo Evaluation
2.3.1 Radiolabeling
and PET/CT Imaging
In vivo PET imaging application of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs on an animal model (mice) was performed to test the stability
of the 64Cu–MANOTA complex in a first set of experiments.
Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
was radiolabeled with 64Cu with satisfying specific activity
(3 MBq μmolFe–1). Radiolabeling
yield was only 60% before purification, which may be explained by
complexation of iron ions present in solution, leading to a competition
between iron and copper chelation.

An amount of 0.8–1.2
μmolFe per mouse with an initial activity (at t0) of 2.5–3.7 MBq per mouse (64Cu) is injected. Then, images are acquired 1 and 24 h after injection
(Figure 7). After
1 h, a large uptake of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA–64Cu NPs is observed in the liver, spleen, and bladder. In
addition, a small activity is observed in lungs and digestive system.
After 24 h, most of the radioactivity disappeared. Nevertheless, a
scale up of the image after 24 h allows to show the low remaining
activity in the liver with a weak signal in the spleen and digestive
system. Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA–64Cu NPs are progressively eliminated from the body after 24
h.

Figure 7 Whole-body PET imaging of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA–64Cu NPs on mouse 1 and 24 h after injection with a scale up
at 24 h. Labels: B = bladder, DS = digestive system, Li = liver, and
Lu = lungs.

A biodistribution study
of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA–64Cu NPs was performed to determine the potential of these
NPs as a bimodal PET/MRI in vivo probe. First, several blood samples
were analyzed (Figure 8). After 1 h, the activity of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA–64Cu NPs in the bloodstream decreases quickly from ∼8
to ∼2%. As demonstrated in Figure 8, the blood clearance of SPIONs was fast.
This phenomenon is due to the particle charges (+6 mV) and their
relatively large size (119 ± 6 nm). Another reason would be their
surface coating. Longer circulation half-life has been noted on 64Cu-labeled magnetite NPs60 (37%
of the injected dose remained in blood after 1 h), maybe due to the
PEGylated phospholipids coating of these nanoparticles or to smaller
hydrodynamic sizes (20.3 ± 1.9 nm).

Figure 8 Evaluation of the injected
dose (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA–64Cu) per gram (tissue) in blood circulation on three mice
during 2 h following intravenous injection.

Then, we observe that the radioactivity is mainly localized
in
the liver (9% ID g–1), spleen (6% ID g–1), lungs (6% ID g–1), and kidneys (5% ID g–1) with a low activity in the heart (3% ID g–1) after 48 h (Figure 9). These results confirm the PET images (Figure 7). A previous study reveals
that a hydrodynamic size of 85 nm also induces a rapid clearance.36 Moreover, it has been previously reported that
positively charged nanoparticles can lead to nonspecific internalization
rate and short blood circulation half-life.61 Nevertheless, after 48 h, a small activity in blood (1% ID g–1) and heart (2% ID g–1) is still detected (Figure 9). This low activity in bloodstream (heart and lungs, both
of which are heavily vascularized tissues) shows that NPs followed
the pattern of blood retention.60 Our biodistribution
study is in accordance with a previous study with different 64Cu-labeled superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs for PET/MRI imaging (NOTA
macrocycle).33 These observations seem
to prove that MANOTA does not desorb from the surface of NPs. By adding
the activities obtained by the γ-counting of all organs and
carcasses to the data, we determine the remaining activity in the
animal at the time of euthanasia. Fifty percent of the injected dose
is eliminated after 48 h. These results show that we can deliver high
doses in liver and spleen. These bimodal contrast agents can be very
interesting for some liver pathologies that lack precision of current
imaging procedures, such as infections62 or cystic lesions,63 for which multimodal
imaging may improve early diagnosis and takeover. Moreover, we show
and confirm that MANOTA has a high efficiency to complex 64Cu with good stability as recently reported.43 Indeed, we have also analyzed, via magnetic susceptibility method
(Figure S4), the urine of the injected
animals and found some signal demonstrating the presence of SPIONs
in the bladder and urine. It is possible that due to the polydispersity
of our nanoparticles, the smallest ones could have been excreted in
urine, explaining the presence of radioactivity in this organ without 64Cu decomplexation from particle surface during circulation.
Thus, we proved that when radioactivity was observed in urine, the
presence of SPIONs was also proven, demonstrating that these nanohybrids
were excreted intact.

48 h after intravenous injection in mice. Values represent the mean
± standard deviation of the percentage of the injected dose per
gram of tissue in different organs (n = 4).

Consequently, the Cu64-radiolabeled Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs are detectable
by PET imaging, with a rapid elimination from the body and main metabolism
in liver. The fast clearance as well as the imaging capabilities confirm
that a novel NP-based PET imaging probe was successfully developed.
MANOTA, a recently developed macrocycle, was grafted for the first
time and with a high efficiency on the surface of prefunctionalized
NPs (Fe3O4–LDOPA) synthesized thanks
to a continuous hydrothermal process. No previous study reports the
grafting and the study of this macrocycle (MANOTA) on magnetite NPs
for an in vivo application. For this reason, we decided to further
investigate our compounds, and we could carried out a second in vivo
set of experiments combining MRI and PET imaging to test the bimodal
potential of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs.

2.3.2 In-Line PET/MRI Imaging
The Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA NPs show
a high transverse relaxivity (r2 = 360
± 10 mMFe–1 s–1), which confirms that these NPs are an excellent probe for T2 and T2*-weighted
MRI. We conducted thereby a PET/MRI imaging study, using a new and
innovative apparatus, which allows to perform MRI and PET sequentially
within the same imaging session without the transfer of mice between
each imaging technique. MR signal variation was evaluated in the cortex
of the kidneys and the liver for this experience. Three-dimensional
(3D) T2*-weighted MRI images were performed
before, 1 and 24 h after injection of the particle suspension and
PET imaging was performed after 1 and 24 h. MRI images show a clear
negative contrast effect in the renal cortex (outer structure of kidneys)
1 and 24 h after injection compared with images before injection (Figure 10a). The observed
signal variations in the kidneys could be distinguished on MRI images
as a gradual darkening of the renal cortex signal (Figures 10a). PET imaging (Figure 10b) also shows
activity in liver after 1 and 24 h. These observations combined
with the previous study confirm that Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA–64Cu NPs have bimodal imaging properties with high transverse
relaxation and radioactive property. Moreover, PET studies combined
with MRI show that 64Cu is not dissociated from its complex
with MANOTA macrocycle grafted on the surface of NPs, which has already
been observed for 64Cu–DOTA and TETA complexes.60,64 Indeed, 64Cu, detected thanks to PET, was localized in
the same organs than SPIONs, detected thanks to MRI. Biodistribution
data and PET/MRI images show that Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA–64Cu NPs are efficient for liver, kidneys, and spleen evaluation.

and 24 h (24 h post-iv) after injection of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA–64Cu NPs
in a mouse.

3 Conclusions
In this study, for the first time, we succeeded
in grafting PEG
and MANOTA chelator on prefunctionalized iron oxide NPs (Fe3O4–LDOPA) synthesized under continuous hydrothermal
conditions (150 °C and 25 MPa) for bimodal PET/MRI imaging. The
characterization of the functionalized NPs (XPS, IR, ζ-potential,
and DLS analyses) confirmed that it is possible to graft PEG and MANOTA
on COOH and NH2 groups of LDOPA, respectively. The hydrodynamic
size of the NPs under 200 nm is relevant for use as an in vivo contrast
agent. The functional groups of LDOPA remain available after the continuous
hydrothermal synthesis. Bimodal imaging PET/MRI experiments are encouraging,
as these NPs are detectable in both PET and MRI with a high contrast.
They highlight an activity in the liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys
with a gradual elimination from the body. NPs showed a high contrast
between tissues without NPs and tissues with functionalized NPs. These
results are promising and point out the potential benefits of MANOTA-labeled
iron oxide nanoparticles as a good candidate for a bimodal PET/MRI
tracer. Additionally, a specific targeting may be envisaged with the
grafting of proteins on the surface of NPs to develop a diagnostic
imaging agent.

LDOPA (98%), N-hydroxysuccinimide (98%) N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) (99.5%), and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Demineralized water
(conductivity, σ = 2.2 μS cm–1) was used for the hydrothermal synthesis. Phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) 1× solution was purchased from Fisher Bioreagents. Extra
dry dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO > 99.7%) was purchased from
Acros. MeO–PEG–NH2 (molecular weight, MW
= 2000 Da) was purchased from Iris Biotech GmbH. 2,2,2-(2-{[2-(4-Isothiocyanatophenyl)acetamido]methyl}-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triyl)triacetic
acid (p-NCS-Bz-MANOTA) was synthesized as previously
described.4264Cu copper chloride
(64CuCl2, 1 in 0.1 N HCl) was purchased from
Arronax (Saint-Herblain, France). The radiolabeling yield and the
absence of free 64Cu in the labeled constructs were determined
using instant thin layer chromatography impregnated with silica gel
(ITLC-SG) strips (Agilent, Santa-Clara, CA).

4.2 Characterization
4.2.1 Powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Characterization
XRD
pattern was collected using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer
with Cu Kβ radiation (λ = 1.39222 Å). Scans
were acquired over a 2θ range of 20–59° with a step size of 0.03° and a scan speed of 150 s per angle.
Diffract-AT software was used for the data analysis (curve fitting).
Correction of instrumental broadening was carried out using a standard
reference material (Quartz). The mean crystallite size of the samples
was calculated using Halder and Wagner method by XRD line-broadening
technique.65 The lattice parameter of the
powder was deduced from the XRD line positions using a least-squares
refinement method (in-house software taking into account the effect
of sample gap).

4.2.2 Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM) Observations
TEM measurements were performed
using a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope
operating at 200 kV (point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm). A diluted
suspension of NPs in deionized water was evaporated on a carbon-coated
copper grid. The average size of crystallites was calculated by counting
100 individual nanoparticles. The size distribution curves were calculated
using a Gaussian fit.

4.2.3 Surface Area Measurements
Specific
surface area measurement was performed with a Micromeritics Tristar
II apparatus and calculated with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method (SBET) from N2 gas adsorption. The samples were first outgassed in situ (20 mTorr;
100 °C; 16 h).

4.2.4 ζ-Potential Measurements
and Dynamic
Light Scattering (DLS) Measurements
ζ-Potential and
DLS measurements were carried out with Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS supplied
with DTS Nano V7.12 software. For each ζ-potential measurement,
powders were dispersed in 12 mL of NaCl aqueous solution (10–2 M). pH titrations were performed using HCl (0.1 M), NaOH (0.1 M),
or NaOH (0.01 M) aqueous solutions. The DLS measurements of suspensions
were performed at 25 ± 0.1 °C in NaCl (10–2 M). The samples were filtered (0.45 μm filter) to remove possible
pollutants or large agglomerates. The DLS curves were derived from
intensity calculations.

4.2.5 Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy
Measurements
IR spectroscopy measurements were performed
on ATR mode using Thermofisher
Iz10. The IR spectra were collected in the wavenumber range of 4000–750
cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1.

4.2.6 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Measurements
XPS measurements were carried out using a PHI 5000 Versaprobe instrument
with an Al Kα monochromatic radiation (EKα(Al) = 1486.7 eV with a spot size 200 μm in diameter).
The powders were pressed on an indium sheet. Data were analyzed with
CasaXPS processing and MultiPak software. Neutralization method was
employed to minimize the charging effects and the carbon C 1s peak
at 284.5 eV was used as the reference. As LDOPA, PEG, and MANOTA are
insulators, neutralization process is required. A Shirley background
was subtracted and Gauss (70%)–Lorentz (30%) profiles were
used. Full width at half-maximum was fixed between 1.5 and 2.4 eV
except for the fitted C 1s (π–π*) peak (2.3 eV).
The MultiPak software was employed for the quantitative analysis.

4.2.7 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) Measurements
The powders were analyzed using Discovery TGA-TA Instruments with
a nitrogen flow rate of 25 mL min–1. A temperature
ramp of 5 °C min–1 from 25 to 800 °C was
employed.

4.2.8 Relaxivity Measurements
The particle
transverse relaxivity (r2 in mMFe–1 s–1) was calculated according
to the following method.66 Water proton
transverse relaxation time (T2) measurements
at 3 T were carried out at 298 ± 1 K with a Siemens Magnetom
Trio TIM using a commercially available birdcage head coil. Relaxation
time measurements were performed on test tubes containing SPIONs in
acrylamide gel at different concentrations (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10
μgFe mL–1). For T2 determination, a multi-echo spin-echo pulse sequence
was used, with a repletion time (TR) of 5000 ms, a matrix of 256 ×
204, a FOV of 100 × 80 mm2, and a slice thickness
of 5 mm. Images were acquired at 32 echoes, from a TE of 8 ms to 256
ms with a 8 ms interval. Image analyses were performed using ImageJ
(image analysis software developed by NIH). The signal-decay curve
was fitted using a nonlinear function with an equation of S(TE) = A e(−TE/T2), and
the relaxivity, r2 (in mMFe–1 s–1), was determined by fitting
the curve of relaxation rate (1/T2) versus
the iron concentration in μgFe mL–1.

4.2.9 Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements (MSM)
Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on a Bartington
MS3 magneto-susceptometer at 300 K. A MS2G monofrequency sensor was
used for around 1 mL cells operated at 1.3 kHz. Before every measurement,
a control cell with the same media or material without any SPION was
measured and subtracted as background.67 A calibration curve realized with LDOPA–SPIONs was used to
determine the quantity of nanoparticles in different media/organs.

4.2.10 In Vivo PET-CT and PET-MR Imaging
All
animal studies were conducted in accordance with the legislation
on the use of laboratory animals (directive 2010/63/EU) and approved
by accredited Ethical committee (C2ea Grand Campus no. 105). Female
CD-1 mice (20–25 g, Charles River, France) were used.

In the first set of experiments, PET-CT imaging was performed using
BioPET-CT preclinical imaging system (Bioscan). Whole-body CT scan
was acquired using the following parameters: 150 μA, 45 kV,
360 projections, and 8 shots/projection. Whole-body 45–60 min
static PET image was obtained using 250–700 keV energy window.

In the second set of experiments, a sequential MRS-PET system (MR
solutions, U.K.) was used. This system associates a 3T cryogen free
magnet MRS 3000 with a clip-on SiPM PET ring. PET (250–700
keV) and MRI acquisitions (scout images followed by a gradient echo
sequence—FLASH-3D: TE 5 ms; TR 40 ms; 0.5 mm slice thickness—acquired
in the coronal plane) were performed sequentially. Animal respiration
was monitored with abdominal pressure sensor and dedicated software
(PC Sam, SAII, Stony Brook).

Finally, the PET-CT and PET-MR
fusion images were obtained using
VivoQuant (Invicro, Boston). Each scan was then visually interpreted.

For biodistribution evaluation, the mice were euthanized, organs
were collected and weighed, and radioactivity was measured with a
scintillation γ-counter (Cobra 4180, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).

4.3 Methods
4.3.1 Fe3O4–LDOPA
NPs Synthesis
The Fe3O4–LDOPA
NPs were synthesized using a hydrothermal continuous process previously
reported.49 Briefly, at 20 °C, a solution
of ferrous and ferric ions (8 and 16 mM, respectively) with a 1:2
molar ratio in aqueous solution (High Pressure Pump 1, HPP 1), 0.33
M of NaOH solution (HPP 2), and preheated demineralized water (HPP
3) was introduced in the counter-current reactor. LDOPA, 24 mM, was
added to the metallic salt precursors. The suspension was then quickly
cooled to stop the growth of NPs in two steps by the addition of water
(HPP 4) at 20 °C and using a cooling bath. The experiment was
conducted at 150 °C and 25 MPa in the whole apparatus with a
total flow rate of 80 mL min–1 (4 × 20 mL min–1). The product was washed by dialysis (Cellu·Sep
tubular membranes of 3500 Da) and ultrafiltered (Amicon UltraCell
30 kDa) until the dielectric constant value of demineralized water
was obtained (2.2 μS cm–1). Dry powder was
obtained by lyophilization for subsequent analysis. A small amount
was saved in suspension for DLS and TEM measurements.

4.3.2 Conjugation of Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs
with PEG
Fe3O4–LDOPA
NPs, 17.5 mg, were suspended in 5 mL of DMSO. The suspension was placed
in a sonic bath for 3 min (30 W) and then using an ultrasonic probe
for 10 s (80% of a 400 W Branson Ultrasonic device). EDC, 76.85 mg,
and then NHS, 113.92 mg, were added to the suspension and placed in
a sonic bath for 10 s (30 W). An orbital shaker was then applied for
15 min. The product was mixed with 100 mg of MeO–PEG–NH2 (MW: 2000 Da) and 700 μL of DIEA. Finally, the suspension
was placed under an orbital shaker for 3 h. The suspension (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG) was purified by ultrafiltration
(Amicon UltraCell 30 kDa). A schematic view of the conjugation chemistry
between the Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs with PEG
is presented in Figure 11.

Figure 11 Schematic view of the conjugation chemistry between Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs with PEG and p-NCS-Bz-MANOTA.

4.3.3 Conjugation
of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG NPs with p-NCS-Bz-MANOTA
Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG
NPs, 10.1 mg,
were suspended in 5 mL of DMSO. The suspension was placed in a sonic
bath for 3 min and then under an ultrasonic tip for 10 s (80% of a
400 W Branson Ultrasonic device). Seven hundred microliters of DIEA
were added. p-NCS-Bz-MANOTA, 7.9 mg, were added
to the suspension, which was placed under an orbital shaker for 3
h. The final suspension (Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA)
was purified by ultrafiltration (Amicon UltraCel 30 kDa). A schematic
view of the conjugation chemistry between Fe3O4–LDOPA NPs with PEG and p-NCS-Bz-MANOTA
is presented in Figure 11.

4.4 Radiolabeling of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA NPs by 64Cu
64CuCl2 (94 μL),
116 MBq, was mixed with
an equal volume of 1 M CH3CO2NH4 buffer,
resulting in a final pH of 5.6. 333 μL of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA (20 μmol Fe,
52 μL) were then added and the mixture was stirred for 45 min
at 37 °C. After incubation, 35 μL of 50 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) in 0.1 M AcONH4 was added to chelate the possibly
free copper-64. The resulting 64Cu–EDTA was then
removed by ultrafiltration with 30 kDa Amicon Ultra, and the product
was diluted in PBS, pH 7.4 prior to injection. ITLC was performed
to determine the radiolabeling yield and to assess the absence of
free 64Cu. ITLC-SG strip was eluted with sodium citrate
0.1 M, pH 5 and the strip was then analyzed using an AR-2000
radiochromatograph (Eckert & Ziegler, Berlin, Germany) (Rf = 0 for radiolabeled nanoparticles,
whereas Rf = 1 for small 64Cu-chelates (i.e., 64Cu–EDTA or 64Cu–AcO)).

4.5 In Vitro Cytotoxicity Study
4.5.1 Cell
Culture
The human hepatocellular
carcinoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from ECACC (European collection
of authenticated cell cultures). Routine monitoring has shown the
HepG2 cells to be mycoplasma free (MycoAlert PLUS detection kit from
Lonza). The cells were grown in a monolayer culture in minimal essential
medium (MEM) supplemented with 1% stable glutamine (PAA), 1% nonessential
amino acids (PAA), and 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v) (FBS from PAA)
in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C containing 5% CO2. Continuous cultures were maintained by subculturing flasks every
7 days at 2.106 cells/75 cm2 by trypsination.

4.5.2 Test Plate Preparation
After washing
with sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS), the cells were detached
by trypsinization (0.05% trypsin/EDTA from Gibco). Twenty-four hours
before exposure, HepG2 cells were seeded into 96-well plates (Dutscher,
France) in 200 μL of complete culture medium at a final concentration
of 1.104 cells per well for resazurin assay.

4.5.3 Treatment of HepG2 Cells
The HepG2
cells were grown at 37 °C for 24 h and then exposed to varying
concentrations of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs between 2.34 and 300 μg mL–1. The cytotoxicity
was checked at 24 h.

4.5.4 Resazurin Assay
The cell viability
was assessed using resazurin assay. This dye is taken up in cells
by passive diffusion and reduced in mitochondria. Continued growth
maintains a reduced environment and causes the redox indicator to
change from oxidized form (Resazurin: non-fluorescent, blue) to reduced
form (Resorufin: fluorescent, red). HepG2 cells were seeded into 96-well
plate (Dutscher, France) in 200 μL of complete culture medium
with 10% FBS at a final concentration of 1.104 cells per
well. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the medium was removed and
the cells were exposed to Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA
NPs in complete medium with 0.5% of FBS. The plates were then returned
to incubator for 24 h. Medium was removed and replaced with 100 μL
resazurin per well and dissolved in MEM 1× without phenol red,
yielding a final concentration of 100 μg mL–1. Plates were then placed in the incubator for 3 h and the fluorescence
was recorded on a plate reader (Chameleon IV, ScienceTech) (excitation
544 nm, emission 590 nm). The value of the wells containing only MEM
and nanoparticles were subtracted from the raw data to take into account
the natural fluorescence of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA.
Viability was expressed as %, calculated from fluorescence value emitted
by treated cells compared to control (medium or vehicle only), and
fixed at 100%. Mean and standard deviations were generated from three
independent experiments. The comparison of means was made between
different concentrations tested and negative control. Various statistical
tests were performed with the GraphPadPrism software. Intergroup comparisons
were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s
test (p < 0.05).

4.6 In Vivo Studies
In the first set
of experiments, four mice were intravenously injected with 2.5–3
MBq of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA–64Cu NPs under isoflurane anesthesia. One mouse was imaged
by PET-CT at 1 and 24 h after injection. Three other mice were used
for blood sampling (one drop harvested at the lateral tail vein, i.e.,
20 μL samples) at 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and
4 h postinjection times for γ-counting and evaluation of circulating
Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA–64Cu NPs levels. At 48 h postinjection time, the four mice
were euthanized and organs collected for γ-counting and biodistribution
quantification.

In the second set of experiments, after MRI
baseline imaging, three mice were intravenously injected with 5–8
MBq of Fe3O4–LDOPA–PEG–MANOTA–64Cu NPs under isoflurane anesthesia. The three mice were imaged
by PET-MRI at 1 and 24 h postinjection. At 48 h postinjection, the
three mice were euthanized and organs collected for γ-counting
and biodistribution quantification.
