The surface of gold nanorods (Au
NRs) has been appropriately engineered
to achieve a suitable interface for bioconjugation with horse heart
cytochrome c (HCc). HCc, an extensively studied and
well-characterized protein, represents an ideal model for nanoparticle
(NP)–protein conjugation studies because of its small size,
high stability, and commercial availability. Here, the native state
of the protein has been demonstrated for the first time, by means
of Raman spectroscopy, to be retained upon conjugation with the anisotropic
Au nanostructures, thus validating the proposed protocol as specifically
suited to mostly preserve the plasmonic properties of the NRs and
to retain the structure of the protein. The successful creation of
such bioconjugates with the retention of the protein structure and
function along with the preservation of the NP properties represents
a challenging but essential task, as it provides the only way to access
functional hybrid systems with potential applications in biotechnology,
medicine, and catalysis. In this perspective, the organic capping
surrounding the Au NRs plays a key role, as it represents the functional
interface for the conjugation step. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-coated
Au NRs, prepared by using a seed-mediated synthetic route, have been
wrapped with polyacrylic acid (PAA) by means of electrostatic interactions
following a layer-by-layer approach. The resulting water-dispersible
negatively charged AuNRs@PAA NPs have then been electrostatically
bound to the positively charged HCc. The bioconjugation procedure
has been thoroughly monitored by the combined analysis of UV–vis
absorption, resonance Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies,
transmission electron microscopy microscopy, and ζ-potential,
which verified the successful conjugation of the protein to the nanorods.

Introduction
In the recent years,
new perspectives have been offered by anisotropic
gold nanoparticles (NPs) such as nanorods [gold nanorods (Au NRs)]
because of their interesting optical properties, which have been exploited
especially in biomedical diagnostics, in photothermal therapy, and
as dark field imaging contrast agents and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopic
(SERS) substrates.1−8 Au NRs are characterized by two surface plasmon bands, namely, a
transverse surface plasmon mode located in the visible region around
520 nm and a longitudinal surface plasmon mode at longer wavelengths,
which can be tuned from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR) region
by varying the aspect ratio (length-to-width ratio) of the Au NRs.9−11 Bioconjugates of Au NRs are exceptionally promising candidates for
important biomedical applications, especially when the resonances
of the NRs are tuned to the NIR, where biological tissues are relatively
transparent. In particular, NP–protein hybrid systems have
already demonstrated their potential for many applications in research
and diagnostics, for example, optical biosensing,12 imaging of tissues, cells, or macromolecules,5,13,14 and physicochemical manipulation
of biological systems.15 In this perspective,
it is fundamental that the functional properties of the bioconjugates
are maintained during the preparation. To accomplish this bioconjugation
task, the nature of the NP interface and the adsorption are crucial,
as they can determine conformational changes, denaturation, or undesirable
protein orientations with respect to the substrate16 that endanger their activity. To overcome these problems,
NPs have been modified with small molecules17 or polymeric matrixes18−20 and characterized by means of
bioanalytical techniques involving transduction of protein-based signals
for detection, including electrochemistry,21 and SERS22 to verify the native state
of protein. The goal of this work is to bioconjugate water-dispersible
Au NRs, coated with the positively charged surfactant stabilizer [cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB)], to horse heart cytochrome c (HCc),
while preserving the nanostructure geometry-dependent properties and,
at the same time, the protein structure. Generally, three approaches
have been proposed in the literature to link proteins to Au:23 (i) direct anchoring on the CTAB coating of
Au NRs by exploiting electrostatic adsorption, provided that the protein
is negatively charged; (ii) interposing a negatively charged layer
as a “glue” between CTAB and the protein;24 and (iii) using as intermediate linkers bifunctional
molecules containing a functional group with strong or good affinity
for the metal surface [i.e., cyano (−CN), mercapto (−SH),
carboxylic acid (−COOH), and amino (−NH2)
groups] to, at least partially, displace the native bilayer and, on
the other side, a functional group that interacts with the protein
by means of covalent or noncovalent bonds.23 HCc is used here as a protein probe, being a small, single chain,
mitochondrial protein that plays an important role both in electron
transfer and in programmed cell death (apoptosis). The identification
of a strategy suited to bioconjugate HCc on Au NRs can be of great
interest for biological applications and can allow the refinement
of new operating procedures for protein bioconjugation. A possible
direct covalent interaction of horse heart HCc with the bare Au NRs
surface is not viable because of the lack of functional groups able
to covalently bind the Au surface. Furthermore, HCc exhibits a positively
charged domain around the exposed heme edge25,26 that hampers any direct electrostatic interaction with the positively
charged CTAB-capped Au NRs. In addition, a surface functionalization
step to replace the pristine CTAB coating with bifunctional molecules
more suited for subsequent binding of HCc could cause irreversible
aggregation of Au NRs or a continuous release of the residual CTAB,
thus endangering the protein stability also.27 A reliable strategy, typically used to modify the surface chemistry
and simultaneously protect the native NR coating from possible detachment
of CTAB molecules is based on polyelectrolyte wrapping,27 that endows the nanostructure surface with functional
groups that enable their conjugation with biomolecules, including
DNA, peptides, antibodies, and proteins by means of either electrostatic
or covalent interactions.28 We herein investigate
the viability of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAA) which, being
a weak polyelectrolyte, allows the interaction between HCc and Au
NRs to be modulated by controlling ionic strength and pH, thus obtaining
a suitable wrap for the Au NRs.

Recent studies have shown that
the conformation of HCc adsorbed
on Au NPs depends on surface coverage and NP size.29 To date, preservation of the native structure of HCc has
been achieved on electrodes by using appropriate self-assembled monolayers,26,30 but bioconjugation of colloidal Au NPs has mostly resulted in protein
denaturation.22,31−35 In particular, the conjugation of HCc to Au NPs has
been found to preserve the HCc structure only when the structure has
been decorated with aggregated Ag nanospheres.22 The bioconjugation of Au NRs with proteins is even more
difficult. In fact, the functionalization of Au NRs becomes more crucial
because of the geometrical features of the nanostructures, as NRs
are particularly sensitive to self-assembly and aggregation problems36 and to the possible toxicity issues arising
from the capping molecules that may detach from the nanostructures.27 Herein, “as prepared” CTAB-capped
Au NRs have been functionalized by using the electrostatic layer-by-layer
approach to proceed with their subsequent decoration with HCc. Namely,
the NRs have been coated with a negatively charged polyelectrolyte,
PAA, which effectively enables the interaction of the NRs with HCc,
which is positively charged because of the presence of Lys residues
in its structure. The bioconjugation of the resulting AuNRs@PAA NPs
with HCc, thoroughly characterized by means of ζ-potential,
UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopies,
has demonstrated, for the first time, that the native state of the
protein is preserved. The overall results indicate that the proposed
protocol is specifically suited to accomplish an effective interface
engineering of the Au NRs to bioconjugate HCc, enabling the design
of hybrid nanosystems with a precise control of the inorganic geometry-dependent
properties and the final biological functionality.

Results and Discussion
The characterization of the surface interactions between Au NRs
and proteins is of importance for many potential applications. However,
it has been proven that it is very difficult to achieve protein binding
without damaging the native structure or modifying the NR plasmonic
properties. Furthermore, neither of the two moieties have specific
anchor points that facilitate covalent binding; therefore, the task
represents a significant challenge. To overcome such difficulties
and attain effective bioconjugation of the probe protein HCc, the
surface properties of the Au NRs have been modified by means of a
layer-by-layer electrostatic functionalization procedure. Herein,
CTAB-coated Au NRs with an aspect ratio of 4.2 ± 0.4 (diameter
= 14.1 ± 1.6 nm; length = 58.5 ± 5.8 nm) have been synthesized
by using the seed-mediated approach, which results in NRs that have
the surface coated with a bilayer of CTAB molecules, which ensures
a very good particle dispersion in water, thus minimizing the risk
of aggregation phenomena. Au NRs were prepared by reducing the Au(III)
precursor at room temperature to Au(0) in the presence of CTAB as
a surfactant.

The UV–vis spectrum of colloidal Au NRs
is reported in Figure 1 (black line) and
shows the typical two plasmon bands located at 516 and 800 nm, corresponding
to transverse and longitudinal plasmon modes, respectively. Moreover,
the longitudinal plasmon band is quite narrow and intense compared
with the transverse band, suggesting a high yield of nearly monodisperse
Au NRs.

Figure 1 Evolution of normalized UV–vis absorption spectra of “as
prepared” Au NRs (black line), Au NRs coordinated by PAA (red
line), and HCc-conjugated Au NRs (AuHCc, green line). The inset shows
a zoom of the spectra within the 350–450 nm wavelength range.
The calculated HCc concentration of the AuHCc solution is about 10–6 M (molar absorptivity 1.06 M–1 cm–1).37 A sketch presenting
the multiple functionalization process of Au NRs with HCc is also
included.

Moreover, the ammonium-terminated
polar heads of the surfactants
interact with water molecules in the surrounding environment, conferring
a positive charge to the Au NRs, as demonstrated by the ζ-potential
measurements (Table 1, Figure S1).

index.

The positively charged
quaternary ammonium head of the CTAB molecules
coating the Au NRs promote the electrostatic binding of the positively
charged HCc by interaction with the negatively charged PAA (see the
sketch in Figure 1).
Such a polyelectrolyte wrapping of the NRs is, in principle, able
to limit the possible release of the CTAB molecules of the bilayer
coating the NR surface, thus representing a safe “glue”
compatible with the presence of biomolecules. The most investigated
polyelectrolyte to electrostatically link HCc has been polystyrene
sulfonated (PSS). However, the strong electrostatic interaction with
the negative charges of PSS has been found to cause extensive disruption
of the native structure of HCc.26,38 Conversely, PAA, being
a weak polyelectrolyte, allows the interaction between HCc and Au
NRs to be modulated by the tuning of ionic strength and pH, thus obtaining
the most-suited wrap for the Au NRs. In fact, this process has been
demonstrated to be affected not only by the polymer charge density
and the initial charge distribution on the CTAB-capped Au27 but also by the balance between polymeric unit–NP
attraction and repulsion among polymeric units.39 The charge density of PAA is a function of the solution
pH and, therefore, affects the arrangement of the chains and their
conformation upon surface adsorption.40 In fact, for pH > pKa (PAA, pKa = 4.8), many of the PAA carboxylic groups
are deprotonated, thus inducing stretching of the polymeric chains
because of reciprocal electrostatic repulsion.41 In this study, PAA has been incubated in solution with
the Au NRs at pH 7, obtaining a complete surface coverage. This is
demonstrated by the inversion of the ζ-potential value (Table 1 and Figure S1) from the initial positive charge of the Au NRs
(+36.4 mV) to the negative charge of AuNRs@PAA (−37.9 mV).
The ionic strength of the PAA solution has been left unchanged although,
in principle, tuning this parameter could help optimize the electrostatic
screening of the polyelectrolyte in solution. Nevertheless, any addition
of salt would be detrimental, as it is known to cause aggregation
of Au NRs.42 As can be seen in the absorption
spectrum of the AuNRs@PAA sample, after the purification procedure,
the coverage with the PAA layer does not induce any significant change
in the position of the longitudinal plasmon band (Figure 1, red line). At this stage,
the AuNRs@PAA solution has been incubated with an excess of positively
charged HCc for 1 h to promote electrostatic anchoring of the protein
on the Au NRs (AuHCc sample). The unbound HCc has been removed by
centrifugation cycles, to precipitate and isolate only functionalized
Au NRs. The experimental conditions are decisive not only to control
the amount of protein anchored on the Au NRs surface by simply varying
the incubation time of the protein in the AuNRs@PAA solution but also
to modulate the strength of the interaction between HCc and AuNRs@PAA,
that may affect the extent of protein denaturation at the NR surface.31,43 In addition, it has been reported that a higher protein coverage
could result in an overcrowded arrangement and thus enhance the protein–protein
and protein–NRs interactions that, consequently, may affect
protein folding and, ultimately, its activity.44,45 Therefore, to maintain constant the number of free carboxylates
of PAA coating the Au NRs, the AuNRs@PAA solution has been washed
and redispersed in phosphate buffer solution at physiological pH (pH
7). The presence of HCc in the Au NRs solution is clearly shown by
the absorption spectrum of the AuHCc sample. The appearance of the
Soret band of native HCc (Fe3+) at 409 nm, concomitant
with the slight red shift of the longitudinal plasmon band because
of modification of the chemical environment, is clearly evident (Figure 1, green line). Remarkably,
because of its low molecular weight, the free HCc in solution does
not precipitate along with the bioconjugated Au NRs upon numerous
washing cycles of the sample by centrifugation. In fact, no precipitate
is observed when pure HCc solution was centrifugated in the same experimental
conditions as the bioconjugated sample. The shoulder on the longitudinal
plasmon band observed at higher wavelengths can be ascribed to minor
aggregation phenomena arising from the purification/centrifugation
cycles.

The ζ-potential value after incubation with HCc
(Table 1, Figure S1) decreases because of the reduction
in the number
of free PAA carboxyl groups, which confirms that the protein is well-anchored
and also indicates a good stability of the prepared NRs. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of as-synthesized Au NRs (a), Au
NRs coordinated by PAA (b), and HCc-conjugated Au NRs are reported
in Figure 2. The TEM
micrograph in Figure 2a shows that the shape and size distribution of the Au NRs is quite
uniform with an aspect ratio of 4.2 ± 0.4 (Figure 2g). The TEM analysis of the aspect ratios
of the particles for AuNRs@PAA and AuHCc (Figure 2h,i), performed on the TEM images (Figure 2b,c), shows that
they are 4.2 ± 0.5 and 4.1 ± 0.5, respectively. This confirms
that the Au NRs preserve their size and shape after the polyelectrolyte
wrapping and HCc binding steps. Therefore, the slight modification
of the longitudinal plasmon band position observed in Figure 1 can be safely ascribed to
the modification of the chemical environment of Au NRs. Interestingly,
TEM images of the negatively stained samples (Figure 2d–f) highlight the modification of
the Au NRs organic coating, that passes from a uniform and thin layer
for Au NRs to an inhomogeneous coating of about 2.5 nm for AuNRs@PAA,
consistent with the less compact structure of a polyelectrolyte layer.
Such features are even more evident when the HCc is anchored to the
Au NRs. Furthermore, the diameter analysis by dynamic light scattering
(DLS) (Table 1, Figure S2) shows that the Au NRs are characterized
by an equivalent spherical shape and rather homogeneous in size: 86.1
± 0.5 nm for Au NRs, 127.2 ± 3.0 nm for AuNRs@PAA, and 160.2
± 1.6 nm for AuHCc, whereas their diameters are higher than those
observed by TEM. This discrepancy can be explained by taking into
account that DLS probes the hydrodynamic diameter, which includes
the hydration shell due to the PAA coating. In addition, the DLS analysis
of anisotropic particles, such as Au NRs, has to be interpreted cautiously
because of the possible occurrence of multiple diffusion modes and
must be considered only qualitatively. Nevertheless, such values are
reliable enough to provide a useful indication of the size evolution
trend of the nanostructure along the overall functionalization process.
The diffusion of rod-like NPs is more complicated to describe than
that of nanospheres because the presence of two geometrical parameters
(length l and radius R) requires
that both the rotational and the translational diffusion coefficients
be taken into account for the treatment of the rod-like particle hydrodynamics.
In addition, the overall translational diffusion coefficient is determined
by a suitable combination of the diffusion coefficients for motion
parallel (D∥) and perpendicular
(D⊥) to the long axis of the NR.46,47

images of as-synthesized Au NRs (a), Au NRs coordinated by
PAA (b) and HCc-conjugated Au NRs (c) (100 nm scale bar). The TEM
images of the same samples captured in negative staining mode are
shown in (d–f). (50 nm scale bar). The corresponding aspect
ratio statistical analyses of the particles are presented in (g–i).

The bioconjugation process has
also been monitored by FTIR investigation
(Figure 3, Table S1). The intense signal at 1702 cm–1 and the broad band with medium intensity at 1248
cm–1 are typically associated with ν(C=O)
and ν(C–O) stretching modes of carboxylic group dimers.
The weak bending δ(O–H) mode at 814 cm–1 further confirms the presence of carboxylic group dimers in PAA.
In addition, the asymmetric stretching ν(C–O) mode,
associated with –COO– at 1558 cm−1, is coupled with the weaker symmetric ν(C–O) mode at
1408 cm–1, indicating the presence of carboxylate
ions.48 Therefore, this suggests that at
the pH used (pH 7), the carboxylic groups of the PAA stock solution
are not completely deprotonated and thus both dimers and carboxylate
ions coexist. Remarkably, when PAA interacts with CTAB to wrap the
Au NRs, the intense band at 1702 cm–1 significantly
decreases, leaving the intense band at 1558 cm–1 of the carboxylate ions, which interacts with the ammonium heads
of CTAB (Figure 3B).
The binding of HCc to the PAA layer results in the appearance of the
typical band at 1652 cm–1 (Figure 3D), assigned to the ν(C=O) stretching
mode of amide I of the protein (Figure 3C) that is a very sensitive probe of protein linkages.35 In fact, the intensity of this signal slightly
decreases when HCc electrostatically interacts with PAA.

Figure 3 ATR–FTIR
spectra of PAA (A), AuNRs@PAA (B), HCc (C), and
AuHCc (D).

Therefore, the overlap of the
HCc and PAA bands in the 1500–1700
cm–1 region does not permit any further considerations
on the bioconjugation event. However, any denaturation of the protein
can be ruled out, as indicated by the lack of a band at 1635 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum of AuHCc, typically ascribed
to denatured HCc (Figure 3D).49

The AuHCc RR spectra
(Figure 4, red) show,
for both 406.7 (b) and 514.5 (a) nm excitation,
the coexistence of the oxidized and reduced HCc forms. For 406.7 nm
excitation, in resonance with the HCc Soret bands of both the ferric
(409 nm) and ferrous (417 nm) forms, the spectra are dominated by
the totally symmetric modes of native HCc. In fact, for the Fe2+ form, ν4, ν3, ν2, and ν10 bands are observed at 1363, 1492,
1592, and 1622 cm–1, and for the Fe3+ form, ν4, ν3, ν2, and ν10 bands are observed at 1372, 1502, 1585,
and 1637 cm–1, respectively. The full assignment
is reported in Table S2. Complete HCc oxidation
has been achieved by adding a minimum amount of K3[Fe(CN)6] solution to the AuHCc solution (Figure 4, violet), without any change in the position
of the Au plasmon bands and the HCc Soret band (data not shown). This
suggests that the reduced species represents only a small amount of
the total HCc bound to the NRs, even though it is clearly visible
in the Raman spectrum. This apparent discrepancy probably results
from different resonance intensification factors and cross sections
of the core-size marker bands of the reduced form compared with the
oxidized species. Moreover, the treatment with K3[Fe(CN)6] did not induce any detachment of the protein from the NRs,
as verified by subsequent centrifugation and washing of the sample
(Figure S5). Nevertheless, after the washing,
the reduced species appears again in the Raman spectrum. Upon 514.5
nm excitation (Figure 4, a), in resonance with the Q band transitions of HCc (β-band
at 530 and 520 nm for the ferric and ferrous forms, respectively),
the spectrum is characterized, as expected, by B1g, A2g, and B2g modes. The bands at 1313, 1402, and
1585 cm–1 are assigned to ν21,
ν20, and ν19 of the ferrous form,
respectively. However, the coexistence of the reduced and oxidized
forms causes some changes in the relative intensity ratios of the
bands compared with the spectra of the pure species50,51 (Table S2).

and AuHCc after addition of K3[Fe(CN)6] (violet)
obtained with the 514.5 (a) and 406.7
(b,c) nm excitation wavelengths. The bands assigned to (Fe2+) and (Fe3+) HCc are indicated in green and black, respectively.
Experimental conditions: laser power at the sample 40 (a) and 10 mW
(b,c); average of 15 spectra with 2 h 30 min integration time (a),
4 spectra with 40 min integration time (b), and 8 spectra with 80
min integration time (c). The spectra have been shifted along the
ordinate axis to allow better visualization.

The HCc adsorbed on the NRs retains its native conformation
(i.e.,
the heme iron is bound to the His18 and Met80 internal ligands), as demonstrated by the close correspondence of
the difference spectra obtained by subtracting alternatively the native
HCc (Fe2+) (Figure 5, b-c) and the native HCc (Fe3+) (Figure 5, b-a) from the spectrum of
AuHCc (Figure 5b).
In fact, the core-size marker band frequencies are identical to those
of the native protein in solution, indicating that no changes in the
heme distortion, and hence ligation,52,53 have been
induced by bioconjugation. This conclusion is confirmed by the “fingerprint”
region between 300 and 450 cm–1 that shows that
features are typical of a Met–Fe–His species (Figure 6). Indeed, previous
reports found that upon denaturation the disruption of the Met80–iron bond occurs concomitantly with the loss of the
secondary structure and the increase in the molecular size under equilibrium
unfolding conditions.54 The replacement
of the Met80 heme ligand with other residues should cause
marked changes both in the positions and in the relative intensities
of the Raman bands. In particular, specific iron–ligand stretching
vibrations have been identified for His18–Fe–Lys
and His18–Fe–His misligation as well as specific
band patterns for His18–Fe–OH– and His18–Fe–H2O conformations.55−99 Because the band frequencies and the intensity pattern of AuHCc
(Figure 6b, red) are
identical to those of the oxidized protein in solution (Figure 6a), with some minor changes
due to the presence of a small percentage of the reduced species (Figure 6b), the HCc structure
and heme ligation are fully conserved on the Au NR surface.

laser power at the sample 10 mW, and average of 48 spectra with 4
h integration time; and (c) 413.1 nm excitation wavelength, laser
power at the sample 5 mW, and average of 4 spectra with 20 min integration
time. The intensities are normalized to that of the ν4 band. The spectra have been shifted along the ordinate axis to allow
better visualization.

(a,c) and 10 mW (b); average of 5 spectra with 25 min integration
time (a), 18 spectra with 3 h integration time (b), and 4 spectra
with 20 min integration time (c). The spectra have been shifted along
the ordinate axis to allow better visualization.

No SE(R)RS effect has been observed for both 406.7 (Figure S6) and 514.5 nm excitation because the
intensity of the HCc signals is the same (or marginally lower) as
that of a pure HCc buffer solution at 10–6 M (Figure S3), that is, the calculated HCc concentration
from the spectrum in Figure 1 (green line). Excitation with the 632.8, 647.1, 785, and
1064 nm laser lines has been also checked. However, no HCc signals
have been observed (data not shown).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, this work has demonstrated that water-dispersible
CTAB-coated Au NRs, prepared by means of a seed-mediated synthetic
route, can be wrapped with polyacrylic acid (PAA) by exploiting the
electrostatic interactions between CTAB and PAA, without modifying
the NRs optical properties. This layer-by-layer preparation scheme
has been then used also to accomplish the electrostatic binding of
positively charged HCc on the negatively charged AuNRs@PAA NPs. The
thorough characterization of the bioconjugation procedure has established
that the native state of the protein has been retained upon conjugation
with Au NRs and that the plasmonic properties of the Au NRs have also
been mostly maintained. This result, confirming the success of the
proposed protocol, represents the first example of HCc bioconjugation
with anisotropic Au NPs. Hence, it is now possible to envisage the
design of similar systems for biomimetic applications and for integration
in bioelectronics devices.

General Protocol
for the “Seed-Mediated” Synthesis
of Au Nanorods
CTAB-capped Au NRs with a longitudinal plasmon
band at 800 nm were prepared using a suitably modified literature
procedure commonly known as the seed-mediated growth method.61,62 Briefly, a “seed” solution containing CTAB-stabilized
Au NPs (<3 nm) was prepared by reducing the Au precursor, HAuCl4·3H2O (5 mL, 5 × 10–4 M), with NaBH4 (0.01 M) in CTAB (5 mL, 0.2 M) and then
was kept under vigorous stirring for 2 h. At the same time, the Au
NR growth solution was prepared: 8.5 mg of AgNO3, 18.22
g of CTAB, and 100 mg of HAuCl4·3H2O were
dissolved in 500 mL of deionized water (CTAB dissolution was assisted
by sonication). This mixture was kept at room temperature under continuous
stirring. After 3 min, 7 mL of a 0.0778 M aqueous solution of ascorbic
acid was added dropwise to the above mixture.61 The mixture became colorless (indicative of the reduction of Au(III)
to Au(I),63 and then, 0.8 mL of the “seed”
solution was added to the entire growth solution. A dark-red color
developed within 10 min. After preparation, cycles of centrifugation
were performed at 7000 rpm for 20 min to wash the Au NRs eliminating
uncoordinated CTAB.

Functionalization of Au NRs with HCc
The Au NRs were
functionalized with HCc by exploiting electrostatic interactions in
a layer-by-layer fashion (see the sketch in Figure 1). In the first step, the “as prepared”
Au NRs were coated with PAA by incubation of 1 mL of Au NRs (2 ×
10–9 M) and 1 mL of PAA (1.6 mg/mL, pH 7) for 20
min under gentle stirring. Then, this mixture was centrifuged two
times at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to wash the Au NRs and eliminate
free PAA. The AuNRs@PAA that precipitated upon centrifugation were
dispersed in a phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7) to ensure deprotonation
of the PAA carboxylate groups and confer negative charges to the NR
surface. Thus, in the second step, 200 μL of the HCc solution
(0.5 mg/mL) in 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was added to the as
prepared AuNRs@PAA solution (5 × 10–10 M),
and this mixture was kept under gentle stirring for 1 h. Finally,
the obtained HCc-conjugated Au NRs (AuHCc) solution was centrifuged
at 7000 rpm for 10 min, and washed with phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH
7) to remove free HCc until no further decrease of the Soret band
absorbance was observed. To ensure complete oxidization of the HCc
adsorbed on the NRs, 2 μL of a K3[Fe(CN)6] solution (1 grain in 1 mL) was added. The resulting solution was
characterized by optical and morphological measurements to monitor
the functionalization process.

Sample Characterization
UV–Visible
Spectroscopy
UV–vis absorption
spectra of solutions of the as prepared NRs and layer-by-layer multilayer-modified
substrate were recorded at room temperature using a Varian Cary 5000
UV–vis–NIR scanning spectrophotometer in the 300–1200
nm range or a Cary 60 (Agilent Technologies) with a 1 mm cuvette and
a 600 nm/min scan rate. Absorption spectra using a 5 mm NMR tube with
a 300 nm/min scan rate were measured both prior to and after RR measurements
to ensure that no degradation had taken place under the experimental
conditions used. The HCc concentration was determined using the molar
absorptivity (ε) of 106 mM–1 cm–1 at 409 nm.37

IR Spectroscopy
Mid-infrared spectra were acquired
with a PerkinElmer Spectrum One FTIR spectrometer equipped with a
deuteratedtryglicinesulfate detector. The spectral resolution used
for all experiments was 4 cm–1. For attenuated total
reflection (ATR) measurements, the internal reflection element (IRE)
used was a three-bounce 4 mm diameter diamond microprism. Cast films
were prepared directly on the IRE by depositing the solution of interest
(3–5 μL) onto the upper face of the diamond crystal and
allowing the solvent to evaporate.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM analyses were
performed with a JEOL JEM-1011 microscope operating at 100 kV. The
specimens were prepared by depositing a few drops of aqueous NP dispersions
onto a carbon-coated copper grid and then allowing the solvent to
evaporate. The samples were stained with a 2% (v/v) phosphotungstic
acid solution for 30 s. A statistical analysis of NR size distributions
was performed on the basis of low-magnification TEM images with the
help of ImageJ software. At least 150 NPs were counted for each sample.

Particle Size, Size Distribution, and ζ-Potential Measurements
The average hydrodynamic diameters (z-average),
size distribution (polydispersity index, PDI), and ζ-potential
were determined using Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments Ltd.,
Worcestershire, UK. Size and size distribution were measured by DLS
after suspension in demineralized water at a suitable concentration
(≈0.1%, w/v NRs concentration). The ZP was determined by laser
Doppler velocimetry after a suitable dilution of the samples with
KCl 1 mM (≈0.01%, w/v NRs concentration).

RR Measurements
RR spectra were recorded using a 5
mm NMR tube and 406.7 (Kr+ laser, Innova 300 C, Coherent,
Santa Clara, CA) and 514.5 nm (Ar+ laser, Innova 90 Coherent,
Santa Clara, CA) excitation wavelengths. Backscattered light from
a slowly rotating NMR tube was collected and focused into a triple
spectrometer (consisting of two Acton Research SpectraPro 2300i and
a SpectraPro 2500i in the final stage with a grating of 3600 or 1800
grooves/mm) working in the subtractive mode, equipped with a liquid
nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device detector. A spectral resolution
of 1.2 cm–1 and spectral dispersion of 0.4 cm–1/pixel were calculated theoretically on the basis
of the optical properties of the spectrometer for the 3600 grating;
for the 1800 grating, used to collect the RR spectra with the 514.5
nm excitation wavelength, the spectral resolution was 4 cm–1 and spectral dispersion 1.2 cm–1/pixel.

The RR spectra were calibrated with indene and carbon tetrachloride
as standards to an accuracy of 1 cm–1 for intense
isolated bands. All the RR measurements were repeated several times
under the same conditions to ensure reproducibility. To improve the
signal-to-noise ratio, a number of spectra were accumulated and summed
only if no spectral differences were noted. Because the spectra of
the HCc-conjugated Au NRs (AuHCc) solutions were characterized by
a strong fluorescence background and a broad intense water band in
the region 1550–1700 cm–1 on which the weak
HCc signals were observed, for both excitation at 406.7 and 514.5
nm, a blank sample spectrum (AuNRs@PAA in buffer solution, see Figure S7) was subtracted from all spectra. All
spectra were baseline-corrected.
