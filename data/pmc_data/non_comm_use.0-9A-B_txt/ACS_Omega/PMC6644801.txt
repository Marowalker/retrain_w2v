Precise positioning
of molecular objects from one location to another
is important for nanomanipulation and is also involved in molecular
motors. Here, we study single-polymer-based positioning on the basis
of the exact solution to the realistic three-dimensional worm-like-chain
(WLC) model. The results suggest the possibility of a surprisingly
accurate flyfishing-like positioning in which tilting one end of a
flexible short polymer enables positioning of the other diffusing
end to a distant location within an error of ∼1 nm. This offers
a new mechanism for designing molecular positioning devices. The flyfishing
effect (and reverse process) likely plays a role in biological molecular
motors and may be used to improve speed of artificial counterparts.
To facilitate these applications, a new force–extension formula
is obtained from the exact WLC solution. This formula has an improved
accuracy over the widely used Marko–Siggia formula for stretched
polymers and is valid for compressed polymers too. The new formula
is useful in analysis of single-molecule stretching experiments and
in estimating intramolecular forces of molecular motors, especially
those involving both stretched and compressed polymer components.

1 Introduction
Precise positioning of molecular objects by rationally designed
molecular devices1−4 is emerging as a new method for nanomanipulation. Notably, a recent
study1 by Funke and Dietz finds that position
resolution near Bohr radius (∼0.04 nm) is feasible using a
DNA origami device. The conventional tools like atomic force microscopy
(AFM), optical or magnetic tweezers, and scanning tunneling microscopy
are all intrusive methods as they involve microscale tips or beads.
The molecular device-based method is nonintrusive and has found applications
in calibrating AFM,3 engineering nanocavity
emission,4 and delivering of molecules.2 The positioning devices reported to date are
all rather rigid structures made of multiple molecular components
or even bigger DNA origami. This paper reports an exact worm-like-chain
(WLC) study suggesting the possibility of fairly accurate remote positioning
(within 1 nm resolution) by a single short and rather soft polymer.

Besides, soft oligomer-based molecular relay from one location
to another is used by track-walking bipedal molecular motors from
biology5,6 and nanotechnology.7−10 From the perspective of first
passage time,11−14 a better positioning accuracy results in a higher rate for site-specific
binding and hence a higher speed for a motor. Intramolecular force
of the relaying oligomer is important for uphill processes within
a motor or in a crowded environment. On the basis of the exact WLC
study, we also obtain an empirical formula for the intramolecular
force of a polymer versus its end-to-end distance that applies to
stretched as well as compressed polymers. This formula is not available
before but is important for studying molecular motors15−17 that involve stretched and compressed states of the same polymer
component.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Single-Polymer
“Flyfishing”
by a Local Alignment at One End
A prominent example of polymer-based
positioning is found in a bipedal biological motor called kinesin,
which is capable of hand-over-hand walking toward the plus end of
a linear cytoskeletal track (microtubule). When this motor has one
leg bound to the track and the other leg diffusing, fuel binding to
the track-bound leg triggers a zippering-like alignment5 of the interleg soft peptide linker at this leg
toward the track’s plus end. This zippering effect throws forward
the diffusing leg at the linker’s other end toward the next
binding site for the walker’s hand-over-hand walking. Such
a polymer “zippering” had been suggested5 to provide a forward bias for kinesin’s leg binding.
Whether this polymer effect really contributes to directionality of
a chemical motor like kinesin is questioned18 later, but the effect certainly improves19 speed and power output of motors like kinesin. In this paper, we
study the zippering-like effect not for directional rectification
in a motor but as a potentially general mechanism of polymer-based
positioning of a molecular agent (e.g., the diffusing leg of kinesin
biped) at one end of the polymer by controlling the position and orientation
of the other end. This study will be focused on the positioning accuracy
for its importance for molecular position/delivery in wider applications
beyond molecular motors. The positioning accuracy also affects the
leg binding rate and thereby speed of bipedal motors like kinesin.

The polymer-based positioning is a fine interplay among the conformational
entropy and bending energy of the polymer. Therefore, we prefer for
this study a general and rigorous polymer theory that counts the conformational
entropy and bending energy accurately and allows the study of positioning
mechanisms in a generic, conceptually clear way. Such a general framework
will be particularly useful in providing guidelines for developing
molecular positioning devices from scratch. Previous theoretical studies
of device/motor-relevant polymer effects focus on specific molecular
systems14,20−27 (mostly biological motors and associated peptide systems) or are
based on approximate solution of polymer mechanics.28−30 A good candidate
for developing the general framework is the WLC model for semiflexible
polymers. On the one hand, the exact solutions to the WLC model from
the path integral scheme31,32 and the green function
scheme33−38 become available recently to allow a precise counting of the conformational
entropy, which remains difficult for other methods like atomic simulations.
The new solutions are already applied to study polymer brush36,38 and diblock copolymer melt.37 On the
other hand, the WLC model has only two parameters: contour length
as a measure of the maximum stretch of a polymer and persistence length
as a measure of the polymer’s bending rigidity. Both parameters
can be extracted by fitting experimental data, potentially making
the WLC model a realistic working model for any polymeric building
blocks of molecular devices.

In this study, we extend the method
in refs (31) and (34) for solving the WLC model
in two dimensions to three dimensions (see the Methods section) and then apply the exact solution to study the zippering-like
polymer-based positioning. Figure 1 presents the probability distribution of one free
end of a three-dimensional WLC polymer when the other end is located
at the origin of the z axis and has different orientations
for its tangent: the end at the origin either has free orientation
or is aligned toward an angle θ = 90, 45, 0° with reference
to the positive z direction to mimic the zippering
effect (following a treatment of Spakowitz and Wang in ref (34)). For the free orientation
and the vertical orientation (θ = 90°), the free end has
two symmetric most probable positions at a positive and a negative z value. When the fixed end is tilted from 90 to 45°
and further 0°, the probability peak at negative z values virtually vanishes but the peak at the positive z value rises.

Figure 1 Mechanics of a worm-like-chain polymer with its one end
located
at the origin (x = 0, y = 0, z = 0) and the other end diffusing to reach a location on
the z axis. The probability distribution of the free
end along the z axis, Q(z) = Q(0, 0, z), and the
free energy F(z) = F(0, 0, z), the intrachain force f(z) = F′(z) derived are shown. The results are for two scenarios: the end at
the origin either has free orientation or is aligned at a fixed angle
θ with respect to the z direction. The polymer
has a contour length lc = 10 nm and a
persistence length lp = 4 nm.

Distinct patterns are observed by examining the
extent of accuracy
by which aligning the end can position the other free end to a certain
location. First, the full width at half maximum (fwhm) of the probability
peaks becomes as small as ∼2 nm for the zero-degree alignment
(Figure 2). This suggests
the possibility of positioning the free end to the most probable location
(zc) within an error of ∼1 nm for
a polymer with a contour length of 10 nm. Second, such a precise site-selective
positioning may occur for rather flexible polymers with lp/lc = 0.3–0.4, not
necessarily require a rigid molecular rod (lp/lc > 1). Indeed, the probability
for locations around zc peaks at intermediate
values of persistence length (lp) for
a certain contour length (lc) (Figure 3). In addition, the
fwhm becomes largely flat when lp/lc changes from 0.3 to 1 (Figure 4). Hence, a flexible polymer of lp/lc ≈ 0.3–0.4
already accesses the regime of precise positioning. Third, the precise
positioning can be modulated by adjusting the end alignment and polymer
rigidity. Changing the end alignment from 90° to 0° shrinks
the fwhm of the probability peaks monotonically (Figure 2) and hence improves the positioning
accuracy. The most probable location of positioning (zc) may be modulated too by the alignment (Figure 2) or by changing the polymer
rigidity (Figure 4),
which may be done by adjusting the solution conditions like ion concentrations,
pH values, temperature, and so forth.

Figure 2 Most probable end location and the fwhm
probability vs the angle
of alignment at the other end for the polymer of Figure 1. The results (symbols) are
extracted from the Q(z) = Q(0, 0, z) distributions in Figure 1.

Figure 3 Dependence of the end probability, free energy and intrachain force
on persistence length for WLC polymers as for Figure 1 for the alignment angle θ = 0. The
polymers have the same contour length lc = 10 nm but different persistence length (lp). The exact solutions are shown by symbols with the lines
to guide eyes.

Figure 4 Most probable end location
and the fwhm probability vs persistence
length for WLC polymers. The results for the scenarios of the end
at the origin having free orientation or being aligned parallel to
the z axis (θ = 0) are shown. The polymers
have the same contour length (lc = 10
nm) but different persistence length (lp). The results (symbols) are extracted from the Q(z) distributions as in Figure 1. In the left panel, a fitting is also shown
for the results for one scenario (the nonlinear part for lp > 2.5 nm is fitted by a polynomial function for spline
interpolation, and the part for lower lp is fitted by a linear line).

Hence, aligning a flexible polymer of lp/lc = 0.3–0.4 and lc = 10 nm at one end positions the other free
end to a
most probable position of zc ≈
8 nm within an error of ∼1 nm along the path parallel to the
alignment. Such a surprisingly precise positioning to a unique, remote
location (relative to the length of the polymer) is achieved by controlling
the flexible polymer at one end, essentially resembling the art of
flyfishing but at molecular level. The speed of a bipedal nanomotor
is largely decided by the position-selective binding of its legs,
which is in turn affected by the mechanics of the interleg polymer
linker. Fine-tuning a nanomotor into the regime of molecular “flyfishing”
may improve the motor’s speed by accelerating forward binding
of its legs: from the free or vertical orientation to zero-degree
orientation, the fwhm drops by a factor of ∼2 (Figure 2) and two most probable positions
merge into one. This amounts to a drop of a factor of ∼4 for
the search volume of a diffusing leg at the linker’s free end.
A rough estimation for the first passage time11−14 suggests more than twofold increase
in the leg’s forward binding rate by the flyfishing. The single-polymer
flyfishing likely plays a role in biological nanomotors. This is consistent
with the observation of zippering in biomotor kinesin, which is the
smallest bipedal motor found in biology but has a rather high speed39 of a few micrometers per second.

2.2 Reverse Detachment by Intrachain Force and
a New Force–Extension Formula
If the polymer’s
free end is captured at the most probable location, for example, via
a binding agent there or equivalently an attractive binding potential,
the polymer’s both ends are bound and the polymer enters the
state with the lowest free energy and the lowest intrachain force
(Figure 1, bottom panels).
When the orientation control at the previously fixed end is removed,
both ends remain to be fixed in location but become free for orientation.
Then, the polymer enters a state with elevated free energy and higher
intrapolymer force (Figure 1, top panels). Similar intrachain forces occur in the interleg
linkers of bipedal biomotors in a two-leg bound state on their tracks
and have been suggested to be a cause24,40,41 for leg dissociation in biomotors (i.e., reverse
process of the flyfishing-enabled leg binding). The leg dissociation
induced purely by an intrachain force in the interleg polymer linker
has also been successfully implemented in artificial DNA bipedal nanomotor15−17 not only for a stretched linker but also for a compressed one. However,
the widely used force–extension formula for polymers, including
the Marko–Siggia formula and later improvements,42 apply only to stretched polymers which have
an end-to-end distance larger than the thermodynamically most probable
extension. To facilitate molecular motor studies, we use the exact
solution to three-dimension WLC polymers to produce an empirical force–extension
formula that is conveniently usable for both stretched and compressed
polymers.

The intrachain force of a polymer depends on the end-to-end
distance as well as the polymer’s persistence length and contour
length. We obtain an analytical formula capturing these dependencies
by fitting the force–extension results from the exact WLC solution
for 0 ≤ z < lc 1  

This new formula
recovers the empirical Marko–Siggia formula,43, at the limit β = lc/lp → ∞, which
corresponds to soft or long polymers. At this limit, the second term
of eq 1 vanishes and
the first term decays to the Marko–Siggia formula. For short
chains with small β values, namely, rod-like polymers near the
other limit β = lc/lp → 0, the new formula captures the exact WLC solution
better than the Marko–Siggia formula for stretched polymers
(Figure 5, positive
values for the intrachain force) and also captures the exact WLC solution
for compressed polymers (Figure 5, negative values for intrachain force). At the limit
β = lc/lp → 0, the first term of eq 1 vanishes as it is proportional to β. This implies
a dropping importance of the entropy effect for increasingly more
rigid polymers, as the entropy effect is reflected in the Marko–Siggia
formula. The second term, namely, , yields a force that changes its sign when
the end-to-end extension drops beyond a threshold (approximately z/lc ≈ 0.83). This is
a typical behavior for rigid rods under a compressing or stretching
force. As can be seen clearly in Figure 5, the rod-like behavior and the entropy-dominated
behavior are both captured by the exact WLC result as well as by eq 1.

Figure 5 New approximate formula
for the force–extension relation
of WLC polymers. The force–extension relation from the exact
solutions in three dimensions for a lc = 10 nm polymer in comparison with the predictions by the new formula
(eq 1) and the Marko–Siggia
formula are shown. Both ends of the polymer have free orientation.

Being valid for both long and
short polymers, the new force–extension
formula of eq 1 is useful
not only for nanomotor studies but also for interpreting single-molecule
mechanical experiments, which had motivated Marko–Siggia formula.
The formula applies not only to stretched polymers but also to compressed
polymers that have an end-to-end distance smaller than the most probable
extension.

For a polymer of a certain contour length, changing
its end-to-end
distance and persistence length switches the polymer between the stretched
and compressed regimes, resulting in different directions and magnitudes
of the intrachain force. Quantitative details of these patterns from
the exact solution are well captured by the new formula (Figures 5, and 3, lowest panels). The new force–extension formula (eq 1) also yields the most
probable end-to-end distance, which occurs at zero intrachain force
and matches the exact WLC result (Figure 4, left panel).

3 Conclusions
In summary, a precise, flyfishing-like control is possible in which
tilting one end of a flexible polymer enables positioning of the other
diffusing end to a remote location within an error of ∼1 nm.
The location and accuracy of this single-polymer flyfishing can be
modulated by adjusting the tilting angle and the chain rigidity. The
single-polymer flyfishing likely plays a role in biological nanomotors
and might be used in artificial nanomotors (for speed improvement)
and in molecular devices for precise positioning of molecular objects.
To facilitate these applications, a new force–extension formula
is obtained from the exact solution to the realistic three-dimensional
WLC model. The new formula has an improved accuracy over the widely
used Marko–Siggia formula for stretched polymers, and also
is valid for compressed polymers. Thus, the new force–extension
formula is useful in analysis of single-molecule stretching experiments
and in estimating the intramolecular force of molecular motors, especially
those involving both stretched and compressed polymer components.

4 Methods
The simplest model for describing semiflexible
polymers without
self-avoidance is the so-called WLC model.44 In this model, the polymer is modeled as a continuous curve—a
configuration C—that can be specified by a d-dimensional (d > 1) curve x(s) (0 ≤ s ≤ lc), with s the arc-length parameterization
of the curve and lc is the contour length
of the polymer. The unit tangent vector to the chain at s is denoted as t(s) = dx(s)/ds(|t(s)|2 = t(s)·t(s) = 1), and the curvature
of the polymer at s is given by κ(s) = |dt(s)/ds|.
For the simplicity of notations, we suppose that one end of the polymer
is tethered to the origin, that is, x(0) = 0, and
the other end x(lc) = r is tagged. As the polymer configuration changes with thermal
agitation, the location r of its tagged end fluctuates.
The quantity we want to compute is Q(r), which is the probability distribution for the location r of the tagged end, and the free energy F(r) which is defined as the change in Q(r) if the tagged end is pulled from r to r + dr. Thus, Q(r) is directly related to the force–extension
relation of the polymer, that is, intrachain force f(r).

4.1 Probability Distribution Q(r)
Different analytical, asymptotic,
and
numerical methods have been proposed in the literature31,34 for solving the WLC model. Here, we extend the method for solving
the WLC model for a two-dimensional case31 to a full three-dimensional case. For a given three-dimensional
curve C: x(s) (0
≤ s ≤ lc) of a polymer, we have  and the bending energy
of the polymer is  with A the bending modulus.
To compute Q(r), we need to sum
over all polymer configurations C which end at r, with a Boltzmann weight or the partition function according
to the Boltzmann’s law 2  where kB is the
Boltzmann constant and T is temperature. This is
a standard counting problem in statistical mechanics and can be naturally
addressed in the language of path integration by considering the Brownian
motion in the space of the tangent vectors t(s) (0 ≤ s ≤ lc). The advantage of this approach is that the tangent
vectors form a unit sphere and thus the problem reduces to studying
Brownian motion on the unit sphere, which can be handled by the standard
operator techniques familiar from quantum mechanics.

Denote tA = t(0) and tB = t(lc)
as the two unit tangent vectors at the two ends of the configuration C, respectively, of the polymer, and let lp = A/kBT be the persistence length of the polymer and denote the
dimensionless parameter β = lc/lp. Then, Q(r) with tA and tB two given unit vectors for the configuration C can be expressed by the path integral representation31,34 3  where δ3() is the Dirac function
in three dimensions and N is a normalization constant
such that all polymer configurations C which end
at r with different tA and tB are counted. We remark here that Q(r) = 0 when |r| > lc. To find Q(r), we define its generating function P̃(k) through the Laplace transform 4  From eqs 3, 4 and the inverse
Laplace transform,
using the change of variable k = −iu/β with , we get 5  

Plugging eqs 3 into 4 and using the change of variable s = ilpτ and denoting t̃(τ) = t(s) = t(ilpτ), we obtain 6  

In this
equation, if τ and (dt̃/dτ)2/2 + k·t̃ are
viewed as time and Lagrangian, respectively, then it can be interpreted
as the path integral representation for the kernel of a quantum particle
on the unit sphere at inverse temperature β. Thus, we can express P̃(k) for k = (k1, k2, k3)T ∈ C3 as the quantum amplitude to go from an initial tangent
vector state tB to the final tangent vector
state tA in the imaginary time with length
β in the presence of an external potential −k1 sin θ cos φ – k2 sin θ sin φ – k3 cos θ with (θ, φ) the spherical coordinates of
the unit sphere. Therefore, eq 6 can be written as a “vacuum persistence amplitude” 7  where 8  is the corresponding Hamiltonian with 9  In addition, gA := gA(θ,
φ), gB := gB(θ, φ)
are the distribution functions of the unit vectors tA and tB over the unit sphere,
respectively.

Let Ylm := Ylm(θ, φ) (l ≥
0 and |m| ≤ l) be the standard
spherical harmonic functions, then we have 10  where L is an integer chosen
numerically for the truncation, U and V are two column vectors with components ⟨gA|Ylm⟩ ≔
∫0π∫02πgA(θ, φ)Ylm(θ, φ) sin θ dφ dθ
(|m| ≤ l and 0 ≤ l ≤ L) and ⟨Ylm|gA⟩ (|m| ≤ l and 0 ≤ l ≤ L), respectively. Here, for example, if
the end A of the polymer is aligned at a fixed unit direction, that
is, tA = (sin θA cos
φA, sin θA sin φA, cos θA) with θA and φA two fixed angles, then gA(θ,
φ) = δ(cos θ – cos θA)δ(φ
– φA); if the end B of the polymer is free,
that is, tB is uniformly distributed on
the sphere, then gB(θ, φ)
= 1/4π. G is a matrix with entries ⟨Yl′m′|Hk|Ylm⟩ = ⟨Yl′m′|H0|Ylm⟩ – k1⟨Yl′m′|H1|Ylm⟩ – k2⟨Yl′m′|H2|Ylm⟩ – k3⟨Yl′m′|H3|Ylm⟩ (|m|, |m′| ≤ l and 0 ≤ l, l′ ≤ L). By using the properties of the standard spherical harmonic Ylm, we can find for |m|, |m′| ≤ l and l, l′ ≥ 0 that        

In practical
computations, we choose the integer L large enough
such that the truncation error in eq 10 can be negligible and choose the
distribution functions gA(θ, φ)
and gB(θ, φ) for the two unit
vectors tA and tB, respectively, based on the assumption of the chain, for
example, both end free or one end free, the other end fixed, and so
forth. Then, we can compute the matrix G and the
two vectors U and L in eq 10. Then, the matrix exponential
e–βG is computed numerically
via the Páde approximation and P̃(k) can be evaluated by matrix multiplication. Finally, Q(r) is obtained from P̃(k) through eqs 4 and 5. To check the method and
our code as well as to compare it with existing results, we consider
a WLC polymer with one end located at the origin and aligned toward
the z direction, that is, tA = (0, 0, 1)T and the other end
free. After we compute Q(r), we
display the distribution in the x–z plane for different y values (Figure 6). The results agree very well with those
obtained in ref (34) by a different method.

Figure 6 Probability distribution Q(x, y, z) at different y planes
for the diffusing end of a WLC polymer with its other end fixed at
the origin of the x, y, z axes and aligned in parallel to the z axis. The polymer is characterized by different values of β
= lc/lp. The x, y, z values shown in
the figure are in unit of lc.

4.2 Free Energy F(r) and Intrachain Force f(r)
On the basis of the probability distribution
function Q(r), we can derive the
thermodynamic quantities
such as the free energy F(r) and
the intrachain force f(r). In fact,
the free energy of the ensemble F(r) can be computed as 11  

To keep the free end staying at the
position r, a force must be applied, that is, intrachain
force f(r) which can be computed
as 12
