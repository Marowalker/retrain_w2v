H3PO2 has emerged as an indispensable reducing
agent for electroless nickel plating. Commercial preparation of H3PO2, with high purity and low cost, is a great
challenge. In this work, a novel technique by the integration of bipolar
membrane electrodialysis (BMED) with ion-exchange absorption was designed
to prepare high-quality H3PO2 aqueous solution.
The critical parameters, such as voltage drop, NaH2PO2 concentration, and different types of anion-exchange membranes,
were systematically investigated. Continuous experiments indicated
that a high yield of up to 80.06% with a low energy consumption of
4.99 kW h/kg was achieved under optimal operation conditions (voltage
drop of 20 V, feed concentration of 15 wt % NaH2PO2, and anion-exchange membrane of AHA). Moreover, leakage of
Na+ ions through the bipolar membrane was observed. By
using T-52H cation-exchange resin, the final concentration of Na+ ions in H3PO2 aqueous solution was
reduced to 20.91 mg/L. Subsequently, a long-term experiment was performed
to evaluate the stability of the BMED stack, and the concentration
of H3PO2 in the acid compartment reached 4.15
mol/L. Under optimal conditions, the H3PO2 production
cost was estimated at $0.937 kg–1, which was competitive
and economically friendly for industrial application.

1 Introduction
Hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2) is a colorless
water-soluble inorganic acid with strong reducibility, as two H atoms
are directly attached to P.1 The chemical
structure of hypophosphorous acid is shown in Figure 1, revealing the presence of one acidic H
atom and a monoprotic acid. H3PO2 has been widely
applied in industries as a reducing agent in electroplating industry,
as a catalyst in esterification and phosphated steel manufacturing,
as refrigerants for cooling water-treatment manufacture, for the decolorization
of polymers, and so forth.2,3 The H3PO2 products such as 50 wt % aqueous solution and industrial
grade products are commercially available now.1 Simultaneously, the purity of H3PO2 aqueous
solution should be controlled strictly at a low grade of impurities.

Figure 1 Chemical
structure of H3PO2.

Currently, the main techniques to prepare H3PO2 are electro-electrodialysis and ion-exchange.4 Electro-electrodialysis has proven to be a promising, high-efficient,
and convenient method for the production of H3PO2.4,5 Conventionally, the principle of producing H3PO2 by electro-electrodialysis is mainly as follows:
H+, which is generated from decomposed water in the anode,
combines with hypophosphite ions (H2PO2–) to form H3PO2. Chen successfully
applied electro-electrodialysis to prepare high-purity H3PO2.6 However, the drawbacks
of the electro-electrodialysis technique are low yield and high energy
consumption, which is mainly due to the oxidization of H3PO2.2 In addition, the large
amounts of H2 and O2 generated from the electrodes
is also a potential risk for industrial-scale H3PO2 production. For the ion-exchange technique, the cation-exchange
resin characterized by unique functional groups was used to remove
Na+ ions from high-concentration sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) solution.7 Nevertheless,
the ion-exchange technique has been demonstrated to be an effective
method for removing microamounts of interfering ions from aqueous
solution, but it is not suitable for NaH2PO2 aqueous solution with a high concentration.8 This is mainly because the amount of resin is proportional to the
concentration of the solution. The NaH2PO2 solution
with a high concentration requires voluminous cation-exchange resins,
and the time of resin regeneration would be prolonged accordingly.
Furthermore, this process often generates a large amount of wastewater
washed from the resin, which is a pollutant to the environment. Therefore,
the treatment of high-concentration NaH2PO2 solution
by ion-exchange technique would make H3PO2 a
rather costly commodity, which is not suitable for large-scale industrialized
production.3

Bipolar membrane electrodialysis
(BMED) is a well-developed, efficient,
and environmentally friendly technology, which can be used to produce
bases and acids from neutral salts.9,10 The BMED technique
is an integration of bipolar membrane (BM) with conventional electrodialysis.
Meanwhile, the BM comprises an anion-exchange layer, an intermediate
catalytic layer, and a cation-exchange layer. When the voltage drop
is applied on the BMED stack, water will be dissociated into H+ and OH– ions because of the potential gradient
bias in the middle layer of the BM. Hence, the acid and base can be
produced from the salt without other additives through the BMED stack.11 Currently, owing to its unique advantage of
low energy consumption, BMED technique is being successfully applied
in various industrial productions, such as recycling of waste in the
environmental protection industry,12 preparation
of vitamin C and organic salt in the pharmaceutical industry,13 organic acids and bases production in the chemical
industry, and so forth.14,15 Chen et al. investigated
the BMED technique to produce alkali for CO2 adsorption.16 Davis et al. studied the BMED technique for
acids and bases production from dilute salt solutions.17 Yang et al. presented BMED to obtain high-purity
NaOH and acid byproducts by treating Ca2+/Mg2+ brine.18 Unfortunately, the permeation
of salts through the BM is still an inevitable problem, which significantly
affects the purity of the product.19

Herein, a novel process integrating BMED with ion-exchange absorption
was adopted to produce high-quality H3PO2 aqueous
solution. Specifically, a lab-scale BMED setup was used to treat high-concentration
NaH2PO2 solution for the production of H3PO2. Our proposed method proved to be feasible,
and various key parameters such as current density, H3PO2 concentration, energy consumption, yield, and current efficiency
during the BMED process have been systematically investigated.20 The phenomenon of Na+ ions leakage
through the BM was analyzed and processed. Moreover, a long-term experiment
was conducted to investigate the stability of the BMED stack. Compared
to the conventional ion-exchange technique for the production of H3PO2 from NaH2PO2, this study
presented a cost-effective process by using T-52H cation-exchange
resin to treat the interfering Na+ ions in the BMED effluent
of H3PO2, which was demonstrated by the calculation
of process economics.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Impact of Voltage Drop
Voltage drop
is a vital parameter in the BMED process because it determines the
current efficiency, energy consumption, and yield. A series of constant
voltage (CV) drops (10, 15, 20, and 25 V) were used to investigate
the influence of voltage drop on H3PO2 production
with BMED stack. FBM/AHA/CMB/FBM were used in the BMED stack as membrane
pairs, and the initial NaH2PO2 concentration
was 15 wt % in the feed compartment. The effect of voltage drop on
the current density, concentration of H3PO2,
energy consumption, current efficiency, and yield is illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Effect of different voltage
drops across the BMED stack on (a)
current density, (b) concentration of H3PO2,
(c) energy consumption, and (d) current efficiency and yield.

Figure 2a shows
the impact of current density on the BMED stack. The curves show an
upward tendency during the first 10 min, which may be due to the migration
of ions between different compartments. Specifically, the H2PO2– ions migrate to the acid compartment
and Na+ ions migrate to the base compartment, and thus
the electrical resistance of the stack system decreases accordingly.
According to Ohm’s law, the current density increases sharply
at first and then approaches a maximum value. Afterward, when the
H2PO2– ions and Na+ ions in the feed compartment are exhausted, a sharp decrease of
current density can be observed because of increase of electrical
resistance in the BMED stack. In addition, the voltage drop is inversely
proportional to the experimental time. According to the Second-Wien’
effect, ionic mobility increases with the increase of voltage drop
across the BMED stack.21 Therefore, higher
voltage drop causes shorter experimental time. In contrast, the maximum
current density at the voltage drop of 10 V maintains approximately
for 120 min. This phenomenon suggests that the depressed voltage drop
results in a sharp drop in the ionic mobility, and therefore a longer
experimental time is obtained.

Figure 2b exhibits
the change of H3PO2 concentration in the acid
compartment. The curves are almost linear in the initial experiment,
which is ascribed to the constant driving force by the voltage drop
applied on the BMED stack. Moreover, the linear curves indicate that
the migration rate of ions between the feed compartment and the acid
compartment (H2PO2– and H+ ions) could reach equilibrium state. This is due to the limited
processing capacity of the ion-exchange membrane inside the BMED stack.
Particularly, the ionic mobility is limited at the lower voltage drops,
and thus the concentration curve of H3PO2 exhibits
a smaller slope at the voltage drop of 10 V. The result is consistent
with the previous report by Ji et al.22 Additionally, at higher voltage drops, the slope of the H3PO2 concentration curve increases, and therefore the experimental
time is shorter. However, a slight decrease of the slope of curves
is observed as the experiment progressed, which is mainly due to the
change of the concentration gradient between the feed compartment
and the acid compartment.23 Because the
relatively high concentration gradient between the feed compartment
and the acid compartment prevents the migration of H2PO2–, the H3PO2 concentration
slowly increases and approaches a maximum value at the end of the
experiment.

The effect of voltage drop on energy consumption
is shown in Figure 2c. It suggests that
the energy consumption increases with the increase of voltage drop,
which demonstrates a proportional relationship between the energy
consumption and the voltage drop. Furthermore, at higher voltage drops,
there is higher loss of energy consumption on the nonreversible joule heat.

Figure 2d displays
the effect of voltage drop on the yield and current efficiency. The
measured current efficiency increases when the voltage drop is less
than 20 V. At the voltage drop of 25 V, the current efficiency slightly
drops. The main reason is that the protons with a small hydroradius
transport through the AHA anion-exchange membrane (AM), and thus the
current efficiency is on the decline.24,25 Simultaneously,
the change of H3PO2 yield at different voltage
drops is consistent with the current efficiency. This is because the
selectivity for counterions of the AM decreases with the increasing
voltage drop. Furthermore, the increase of voltage drop accelerates
the generation of H+ ions by the BM, leading to more leakage
of H+ ions through the cation-exchange membrane (CM). Considering
all factors described above, an appropriate voltage drop of 20 V was
selected in the following experiment to maintain a higher current
efficiency and yield.

2.2 Influence of NaH2PO2 Concentration
The concentration of NaH2PO2 solution is a critical factor that may affect
the preparation
of H3PO2 from NaH2PO2 by
the BMED stack. To investigate the influence of NaH2PO2 concentration, a series of concentrations of NaH2PO2 (10–30 wt %) were applied to the feed compartment
with a CV drop of 20 V. FBM/AHA/CMB/FBM were used in the BMED stack
as the membrane pairs. The changes in the current density, concentration
of H3PO2, energy consumption, current efficiency,
and yield at different concentrations of NaH2PO2 solution are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Effect of different NaH2PO2 concentrations
on the (a) current density of the BMED stack, (b) concentration of
H3PO2, (c) energy consumption, and (d) current
efficiency and yield.

Figure 3a
shows
that the current density increases with the concentration of NaH2PO2 during the the first 10 min of the experiment.
The curves display a similar maximum current density with the NaH2PO2 concentration of 15, 20, 25, and 30 wt %. However,
the maximum value of current density is achieved at different times.
This is mainly ascribed to the different conductivities in the initial
feed compartment and the increase of feed concentration, which causes
the current density to be stable for a longer time. In short, with
a higher NaH2PO2 concentration, a longer experimental
time is required at the same voltage drop. Additionally, when the
NaH2PO2 concentration is 10 wt %, the maximum
value of current density is the lowest. It may be due to the extremely
lowest contents of H2PO2– and
Na+ ions in the feed compartment, resulting in the highest
electrical resistance.

As shown in Figure 3b, the concentration of H3PO2 increases with
the experimental time. At the end of the experiment, the concentration
of H3PO2 approaches a maximum value, which can
be ascribed to the existence of concentration diffusion that hinders
the migration of H2PO2– and
Na+ ions. Simultaneously, a similar trend of energy consumption
is observed in Figure 3c. This is due to the increase of concentration of H2PO2– and Na+ ions in the feed compartment,
which causes longer experimental time for the migration of H2PO2– and Na+ at the same
voltage drop of 20 V. Furthermore, the slope of the curves gradually
decreases over time, which is due to the decrease of electrical resistance
of the BMED stack with the increase of NaH2PO2 concentration.

Figure 3d presents
the effect of NaH2PO2 concentration on the current
efficiency and yield. The current efficiency decreases when the concentration
of NaH2PO2 is higher than 20 wt %. The possible
reason is that the protons pass through the AM into the feed compartment.
The highest yield reaches over 80% with a NaH2PO2 concentration of 15 wt % because a higher concentration (20, 25,
and 30 wt %) of NaH2PO2 promotes a higher concentration
of H3PO2. At the end of the experiment, reverse
osmosis of H+ ions will occur, and there is a higher degree
of H+ ion leakage from the acid compartment to the feed
compartment through the AM, which reduces the yield of H3PO2.26 As a consequence, it
can be confirmed that the NaH2PO2 concentration
of 15 wt % is optimal for further explorations.

2.3 Effect of AM Type
The AM is a crucial
factor for the migration of H2PO2– ions. Therefore, a suitable AM should be selected to evaluate the
performance of the BMED stack. In this section, three different AMs
(AHA, FAB, and JAM-II-05) were investigated to prepare H3PO2 with the BMED stack. On the basis of the experimental
results described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the voltage drop of
20 V and the NaH2PO2 concentration of 15 wt
% were used in this experiment. The purpose was to study the effect
of AM on the current density, H3PO2 concentration,
energy consumption, current efficiency, and yield.

As shown
in Figure 4a, all curves
exhibit a similar trend over time. However, it can be observed that
the current density of the AHA membrane stack is higher than those
of the other two membrane stacks, which is mainly due to the lowest
membrane resistance of the AHA membrane. Therefore, the increase of
H3PO2 concentration with the AHA membrane stack
is higher than the other two membrane stacks throughout the experiment,
as shown in Figure 4b. Conversely, the H3PO2 concentration curve
with the FAB membrane stack presents a relatively smaller slope in
the first 25 min. The possible reason is that the ion-exchange capacity
of FAB membrane is lower than those of AHA and JAM-II-05 membranes. Figure 4c displays the effect
of AHA, FAB, and JAM-II-05 membrane stacks on energy consumption.
It suggests that the energy consumption of AHA membrane stack is lower
than those of other membrane stacks. This is possibly due to the relatively
higher membrane resistance of FAB and JAM-II-05 leading to a higher
electrical energy loss.

Figure 4 Effect of AHA, FAB, and JAM-II-05 AMs on the
(a) current density
of the BMED stack, (b) concentration of H3PO2, (c) energy consumption, and (d) current efficiency and yield.

Figure 4d presents
the comparison of yield and current efficiency with the AHA, FAB,
and JAM-II-05 membrane stack. It is obvious that the current efficiency
of the BMED stack with the AHA membrane is higher than those with
the other two membrane stacks. This is ascribed to the higher membrane
resistance of the FAB and JAM-II-05 membranes. However, the H3PO2 yield of the BMED stack with the FAB membrane
is the highest, which is mainly due to the higher transport number
of the FAB membrane. Through the comprehensive comparison between
energy consumption, current efficiency, and yield, the AHA AM is selected
for the production of H3PO2.

2.4 Integration of BMED with Ion-Exchange Absorption
According
to the configuration of the BMED stack, the Na+ ions may
diffuse from the feed compartment into the acid compartment,
which greatly reduce the quality of H3PO2 aqueous
solution. Therefore, the migration of Na+ ions needs to
be further investigated. In this section, FBM/AHA/CMB/FBM was used
as the BMED stack membrane pairs; a voltage drop of 20 V and a NaH2PO2 concentration of 15 wt % were used in this
experiment.

Figure 5a shows the variation of Na+ ion content in the
acid compartment. It indicates that the content of Na+ ions
increases with the experimental time, however, an inflection point
occurs at 20 min. This is mainly due to the leakage of Na+ ions from the electrode compartment in the initial 20 min. Subsequently,
when the Na+ ion content in the base compartment increases,
it may migrate into the acid compartment through the BM leading to
a higher slope of the curve.

Figure 5 (a) Variation of Na+ ion content
in the acid compartment.
(b) Comparison of the Na+ ion content existing in the BMED
effluent and the column effluent.

Figure 5b
reveals
the content of Na+ ions existing in the column effluent,
which is comparable to commercial H3PO2 aqueous
solution in the electroplating industry. Taking into consideration
the removal rate of 90.12% for Na+ ion content, the T-52H
resin is promising for H3PO2 aqueous solution
purification. After the adsorption of T-52H resin, the recycled H3PO2 aqueous solution was concentrated to 51.86
wt % by vacuum evaporation.

2.5 Long-Term Evaluation
Considering
the performance variation of the BMED stack in practical applications,
a long-term experiment was conducted to investigate the stability
of the BMED stack. In this section, the acid tank and base tank were
filled with 500 mL of deionized water before the experiment. NaH2PO2 solution with a concentration of 15 wt % and
volume of 500 mL was used as the feed solution under the batch mode
(feed and bleed). The experiment was operated at a CV drop of 20 V
by using FBM/AHA/CMB/FBM as the membrane pairs.

As illustrated
in Figure 6a, the curve
exhibits a sharp increase in the first 20 min, which is ascribed to
the deionized water in the acid compartment and base compartment.
Therefore, the migration rates of H2PO2– and Na+ ions are extremely high at the
beginning of the experiment. Simultaneously, the electrical resistance
of the BMED stack gradually decreases with the increment of the solution
concentration in each compartment, and thus the current density curve
shows a continuous increase with time. However, the voltage drop is
maintained at a relatively stable value in the last stage of the experiment.
This is due to the high concentration gradient between the feed compartment
and the acid and base compartments inside the BMED stack, resulting
in the extremely slow migration of H2PO2– and Na+ ions. As shown in Figure 6b, the curves are nearly linear
with time in the first 140 min, which suggests that the BMED stack
was running under an almost stable state. Subsequently, the curves
tend to be stable at the end of the experiment, which is mainly due
to the phenomenon of the concentration gradient. Additionally, the
concentration of NaOH is higher than the concentration of H3PO2 over the course of the experiment. This is due to
the intrinsic mobility of H+ ions higher than OH– ions, resulting in the higher leakage of H+ ions.27 Furthermore, the concentration of H3PO2 in the acid compartment reached 4.15 mol/L, whereas
the concentration of NaOH in the base compartment was 4.32 mol/L at
the end of the experiment. The above results suggest that the CMB
and AHA membranes exhibit superior permselectivity under extreme base/acid
circumstances.

experiment;
(b) concentration of H3PO2 and NaOH change with
time under long-term experiment.

2.6 Process Economic Evaluation
The cost
of H3PO2 production can be estimated from the
proposed experimental design. As summarized in Table 1, an estimation of the overall process cost
was listed, including the energy cost and investment cost.28,29 Meanwhile, the energy consumption consists of the BMED setup and
vacuum evaporation. The membrane stack cost and the peripheral cost
were multiplied by a coefficient of 1.5. The result shows that the
cost of producing 1 kg of H3PO2 aqueous solution
from NaH2PO2 is $0.937. Furthermore, the process
cost will be lower in the industrial scale, which is mainly due to
the decrease of energy cost and investment cost as the process capacity
increases.

In contrast, Table 2 illustrates the cost
of ion-exchange for H3PO2 production in the
total process rather than integrated BMED, and
a part of the calculation refers to Wang et al.15 The interest was calculated by the total investment cost
multiplied by a coefficient of 0.08. The cost of maintenance was calculated
by the total investment cost multiplied by a coefficient of 0.10.
As shown in Table 2, the cost of preparing 1 kg of H3PO2 from
NaH2PO2 is approximately $1.859, which is higher
than $0.937 in Table 1. Consequently, it can be confirmed that the integration of BMED
with ion-exchange is an economical choice to produce high-quality
H3PO2, which lays a foundation for the pilot
scale production.

3 Conclusions
A novel technique by the integration of BMED with ion-exchange
absorption was established for producing high-quality H3PO2. The performance of BMED stack was evaluated by the
current density, H3PO2 concentration, energy
consumption, current efficiency, and yield. The experimental conditions
were optimized, such as the voltage drop, concentration of NaH2PO2, and AM. Under optimal conditions, a high yield
of H3PO2 up to 80.06% with a low energy consumption
of 4.99 kW h/kg was achieved. Furthermore, the concentration of Na+ ions in the H3PO2 aqueous solution
decreased to 20.91 mg/L by using T-52H cation-exchange resin. The
BMED stack exhibits superior stability during the long-term experiment,
and the concentration of H3PO2 in the acid compartment
approached 4.15 mol/L. The total process cost was estimated to be
approximately $0.937 kg–1 with the lab-scale equipment,
demonstrating the economic feasibility of H3PO2 production by using BMED in combination with ion-exchange.

4.2 Experimental SetUp
Figure 7a illustrates the schematic
diagram of the setup in this experiment. Each compartment of the BMED
stack was connected to a 1 L tank. Na2SO4 solution
(500 mL, 3 wt %) was used as the supporting electrolyte in the electrode
tank. The feed solution of 500 mL of NaH2PO2 aqueous solution was added into the feed tank. Both acid tank and
base tank were fed with 500 mL of deionized water in the initial experiment.
Between the solution tank and the compartment of the BMED stack, the
solution of each compartment was circulated for 20 min to eliminate
the air bubbles trapped on the membrane surface.30 All solutions were circulated at a constant flow rate of
40 L/h.

Figure 7 (a) Schematic diagram of the experimental device for the preparation
of H3PO2; (b) configuration of the BMED stack;
(c) the experimental device for the purification of H3PO2.

Figure 7b presents
the scheme of a three-configuration BMED stack. The BMED stack consisted
of five repeating units, each unit installed with a BM, an AM, a CM,
and a BM in series. A spacer with 0.7 mm thickness was used to separate
each membrane. The dimension of each membrane area was 297 cm2 with an active membrane area of 189 cm2. The electrodes
were made of a graphite cathode and an anode of titanium coated with
ruthenium. Moreover, a CV/constant current (CC) regulated power supply
(WYL3010S, from Hangzhou Siling Electrical Instrument Ltd., China)
was connected to the electrodes. Driven by the CV drop applied to
the BMED stack, H2PO2– ions
migrated through the AM and combined with H+ ions in the
acid compartment. Simultaneously, Na+ ions migrated through
the CM and combined with OH– ions in the base compartment.31,32

To further optimize the purity of H3PO2 aqueous
solution, a certain amount of cation-exchange resins was used to absorb
the interfering Na+ ions. Figure 7c shows the schematic diagram of the column
mode system. The height of the exchange layer was 40 cm, and the setup
was equipped with 200 mL of T-52H resin. H3PO2 aqueous solution (500 mL) obtained from the BMED effluent was pumped
into the inlet of the column through a peristaltic pump (BT600-2J,
Baoding Longer peristaltic pump, China). Moreover, the H3PO2 aqueous solution was controlled at a rotational flow
rate of 2 BV/h (bed volume per hour) to maintain the liquid level
constant. The Na+ ions in the H3PO2 aqueous solution were replaced by H+ ions released from
the resin reactive groups. After the experiment, the purified H3PO2 aqueous solution was collected from the outlet
of the column. Then, the resin was washed by deionized water and followed
by regeneration using 4 wt % HCl solution.8

4.3 Analytical Methods
A conductivity
meter (S220 type, Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland) was used to measure
the conductivity of the samples from the BMED stack compartment. The
concentration of the acid and base was titrated with NaOH and HCl
standard solutions, respectively. The content of Na+ ions
was determined by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry
(Elan DRC-e, PerkinElmer, USA). The current across the BMED stack
was directly recorded from the CV/CC regulated power supply.

4.4 Data Processing
The current efficiency
was calculated by eq 1(33) 1  where C0 and Ct (mol/L)
correspond to the
molar concentration of H3PO2 at time 0 and t, respectively; V0 and Vt (L) represent the recirculated
volume of H3PO2 in the acid compartment at time
0 and t, respectively; F is the Faraday constant
(96 485 C/mol); N is the number of repeating
units (N = 5); and I (A) is the
current applied.

The energy consumption was calculated by eq 2(33) 2  where Ut refers to the voltage drop across the BMED stack
at time t; Vt (L) is
the volume of H3PO2 in the acid compartment
at time t; and M represents the
molar weight of H3PO2 (65.99 g/mol).

The
production yield was calculated by eq 3 3  where nt (mol) is the molar mass of H3PO2 at
time t and n0 (mol) represents
the molar mass of NaH2PO2 at time 0.

The
removal rate was calculated by eq 4 4  where C (mg/L) is the content
of the Na+ ions in the column effluent and Cm (mg/L) is the content of the Na+ ions in
the BMED effluent.
