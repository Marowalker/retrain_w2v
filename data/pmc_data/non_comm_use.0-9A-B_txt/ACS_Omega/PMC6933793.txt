Magnesium-based alloys are the most widely used materials
for degradable
metallic implants and have considerable potential for bone applications
owing to their excellent stimulating effect on osteogenesis. However,
their high corrosion rate limits their structural stability and causes
oxygen deficiency and an excessive increase in the pH around the defect
area during bone healing. Magnesium oxides, which are the main corrosion
products of Mg, are nontoxic materials with useful effects on new
bone formation and pH neutralization. Metal–phenolic networks
were introduced recently as a cost-effective and efficient surface
modifier and were fabricated by deposition of nanosized metal oxides
on different types of substrates using the chemical reaction between
phenolic groups and metallic ions. In this study, magnesium oxide
films were formed successfully on a Mg-based substrate using Mg–phenolic
networks. The effects of various coating parameters on the surface
morphology, corrosion resistance, degradation behavior, wettability,
and osteocompatibility of degradable metallic materials after surface
modification with Mg–phenolic networks were thoroughly investigated
for the first time. The results showed that the initial concentration
of Mg ions was the main parameter affecting the corrosion resistance,
which was almost as much as 3 times that of uncoated samples. Additionally,
cytotoxicity and viability assessment and observation of the morphological
changes in bonelike cells showed that the in vitro osteocompatibility
was significantly enhanced by coatings with Mg concentrations of 2.4–3.6
mg mL–1. Finally, in vivo animal studies using the
rat calvarial defect model confirmed that the proposed coating method
mitigated the formation of gas cavities around the implantation area
by reducing the corrosion rate of the Mg-based implant. The nanosized
metal oxides produced by the Mg–phenolic network significantly
improved the biodegradability and osteocompatibility of Mg alloys,
suggesting a potential approach to advancing the clinical application
of Mg alloys.

1 Introduction
Magnesium-based alloys
are the most widely used degradable bone-related
implant biomaterials for orthopedic applications.1−3 In addition
to the structural capability of these alloys to provide mechanical
stability, Mg contributes to the metabolism of bone regeneration.4,5 When Mg is implanted in bone defect areas, the contact between the
Mg surface and blood plasma (the main component of blood that contains
mostly water) results in a chemical reaction (see eq 1(6)). Consequently,
Mg ions (Mg2+) are released into the surrounding blood.
It has been proved that the Mg ions effectively enhance the proliferation
and differentiation of osteogenic stem cells, which can support new
bone formation.7 However, the release dosage
of Mg2+ ions should be controlled to prevent toxicity to
the cells in the implantation area.8 Most
of the released Mg2+ ions react with hydroxide ions (OH–) and form a porous Mg(OH)2 film on the
surface of the Mg substrate, which can change to MgO in the absence
of water. Mg(OH)2 is relatively insoluble in water and
has been used as an inorganic nontoxic medicine for pH neutralization
of sour stomach.9 Additionally, as the
main degradation product of magnesium alloys in bone applications,
Mg(OH)2 stimulates osteogenesis and reduces osteoporosis,
resulting in a mature bone with a higher density.10,11 Furthermore, it can be applied as an antibacterial agent with a
high loading capability.12 1  The low standard electrode potential of Mg
makes it very reactive in the presence of electrolytes in blood plasma
or other aqueous solutions.13 Mg(OH)2 and/or MgO oxide films are not dense enough to protect Mg-based
implants against the high corrosion rate in the physiological environment,14 which causes an increase in crack initiation
and propagation and ultimately decreases the mechanical stability
in the defect zone.1,15 According to eq 1, hydrogen gas (H2) is
another corrosion product resulting from Mg degradation. The flow
rate of blood in bone tissues is not naturally high enough to remove
the insoluble H2 bubbles that are released. Therefore,
H2 cavities are formed around Mg implants and prevent the
arrival of sufficient oxygen and other necessary nutrients for adhesion,
proliferation, and differentiation of bone cells at the implant surface,
ultimately killing the cells before bone mineralization begins.6,16,17 Hence, controlling the high corrosion
rate of Mg will reduce the negative consequences of H2 cavity
formation, especially in the days immediately following implantation,
allowing the nutrient effect of the valuable corrosion products of
Mg [i.e., Mg2+, Mg(OH)2] to stimulate bone ingrowth.

Apart from the design of new biocompatible Mg alloys by adding
alloying elements such as Zn, Mn, and Ca18,19 to reduce the corrosion rate of pure Mg, surface modification has
been used as the most effective approach to passivate the surface
of Mg-based alloys and enhance their corrosion resistance. Biomimetic
degradable coatings such as calcium orthophosphate,14,20 collagen,21 and biocomposite coatings
have been shown to be suitable approaches not only to delay the corrosion
of Mg but also to generate a biocompatible interface for bone formation.22 These strategies prolong the corrosion period
by enhancing corrosion resistance of Mg alloy and providing barriers
to corrosion electrolyte.23 Recently, silk
fibroin (SF) coating endowed Mg alloys with superior biocompatibility
and significantly enhanced corrosion resistance as evidenced by a
rabbit spine test for 180 days.24 SF could
also be composited with K3PO4 to form a self-healing
coating on Mg alloys with pH sensitivity, preferable corrosion resistance,
and osteogenic activity.23 However, the
main drawback of these surface passivation methods is that the positive
role of Mg oxides in bone mineralization becomes negligible. Therefore,
deposition of Mg(OH)2 and MgO coatings by various methods
such as ion beam deposition,25 physical
vapor deposition,26 anodization,27 and pulse direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering28 has been proposed to protect Mg alloys. However,
most of these methods require special and expensive equipment to deposit
Mg oxides on the Mg-based substrate. Furthermore, some of them can
be applied only to substrates with simple geometries. Therefore, a
cost-effective, simple, flexible, and efficient method to coat Mg-based
substrates with Mg oxides could offer significant advantages over
the methods mentioned above.

Metal–phenolic networks
(MPNs) were recently introduced
as a flexible and cost-effective surface modification method for deposition
of multiple types of nanoscale biointerfaces on various substrates.29 MPNs are generally formed by dynamic chemical
reactions between metal ions and phenolic molecules using tannic acid
(TA) or phytic acid, which are the two main natural polyphenol products.30,31 Chen et al.32 proposed a Mg-ion-integrated
phytic acid coating to form three-dimensional (3D) networks of Mg
oxides. They found that a bonelike structure formed on the Mg substrate,
which can effectively improve the corrosion resistance and osteocompatibility,
simultaneously stimulating the bioactivity of bonelike apatite precipitation
and osteoblast cell adhesion and proliferation in vitro. Although
some studies have investigated MPNs as surface coatings on Mg alloys,33,34 the effects of experimental parameters such as the type and concentration
of the Mg ion source and phenolic molecules, the number of coating
cycles, and the characteristics of the intermediate layer on the morphology,
density, homogeneity, and stability of the deposited film are not
fully understood. Furthermore, the effects of those parameters on
the degradation behavior, release of Mg ions, corrosion resistance,
cytotoxicity, and cell differentiation need to be elucidated to obtain
an osteocompatible surface.

In this research, Mg–phenolic
networks were deposited on
a Mg–Zn alloy and the effects of coating variables such as
the concentration of Mg ions and number of coating cycles on the surface
morphology and characteristics, corrosion resistance, biodegradability
(i.e., ion release), and cytotoxicity were studied to identify the
optimal coating parameters for surface passivation of Mg-based implants.
Finally, samples were fabricated using the optimal coating parameters
and in vivo animal studies were conducted to compare their degradation
behavior with that of uncoated (raw) samples.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Mg–Phenolic Networks
2.1.1 Surface Morphology
The surface
morphologies of the coated samples after the coating processes are
presented in Figure 1a. The initial step of the coating process using the NaOH solution
produced a uniform nanosized porous film with tiny scales on the surface.
The effect of Mg concentration on the morphology after three coating
cycles is obvious. The tiny scales on the intermediate layer of step
1 were successfully thickened at the lowest Mg concentration (0.6%).
The tiny scales formed in step 1 acted as an intermediate passivation
layer that reduced Mg substrate corrosion by allowing Mg ions to react
with TA to form the 3D phenolic structure. Additionally, the gaps
between the tiny scales were almost filled in 0.6%Mg@TA. When the
initial concentration of Mg was increased from 0.6 to 1.2%, the gaps
in the intermediate layer were completely filled by Mg–phenolic
networks. For the 2.4% Mg group, a cauliflower-like structure was
formed and ultimately became connected to form a uniform secondary
layer as the concentration increased to 3.6%. Moreover, the image
to 0.6%Mg@TA sample shows the formation of cracks on the surfaces
of the coated samples after three cycles of coating at this concentration.
The micro- and nanocracks indicated release of Mg ions from the substrate
and subsequent corrosion. This result indicated that Mg ions at the
initial concentration of 0.6% did not react with the free oxygen ions
of TA. The remaining oxygen ions would react with the substrate, resulting
in a lack of Mg ions and fewer Mg–phenolic networks. Figure 1b compares the thickness
of the coating layer in different samples using backscattered electron
(BSE) imaging. There was no significant difference between the NaOH-
and 0.6%Mg@TA-coated samples. Moreover, the thickness of the coating
layer was increased from 6 to 7.5, 9, and 10 μm by increasing
the initial concentration of Mg during step 2 of the coating process
from 0.6 to 1.2, 2.4, and 3.6%, respectively.

Figure 1 Scanning electron macrographs
of (a) surface morphology of the
coated samples in different process parameters using a secondary electron
detector (SED). (b) Cross section of the coated samples using backscattered
electron scanning.

Figure S1a,b illustrates
the effect
of cycle number on the coating morphology of the 3.6% Mg sample. The
thin scales resulting from step 1 were filled after the first cycle
(Figure 1a); they were
further thickened by Mg phenols and became denser at the end of cycle
two. Figure S1b shows that the cauliflower-like
networks and then began to appear. Thus, step 2 of the coating process
led to filling and thickening of the intermediate layer, initiation
of the formation of the 3D Mg–phenolic structure, and the further
formation of a uniform, dense coating.

2.1.2 Chemical Composition Analysis of the Mg–Phenolic
Film
Figure 2a shows the chemical composition of the NaOH- and 3.6%Mg@TA-coated
samples, as representative of the results of steps 1 and 2 of the
coating procedure (Figure 10). C, O, Mg, and Zn were present in both coatings. Figure 2b shows the high-resolution
Mg 2p spectra of the coating after steps 1 and 2. The Mg 2p spectra
of the NaOH sample showed that step 1 introduced a mixture of MgO
and Mg(OH)2. In contrast, MgO was the main component of
the 3.6%Mg@TA sample owing to the chemical reaction between free O2– ions from TA and Mg2+ ions, which led
to the formation of cauliflower-like Mg–phenolic networks.

spectroscopy (XPS) results: (a) wide scan spectrum, (b) corresponding
Mg 2p high-resolution spectrum; (c) average surface roughness (Sa); (d) water contact angle; significance is
shown as *** and +++ p < 0.001 compared to raw
and NaOH samples, respectively.

2.1.3 Surface Roughness
Figure 2c summarizes the average roughness
(Sa) of various samples observed by atomic
force microscopy (AFM) in a scanning range of 20 × 20 μm2. The average Sa value was approximately
10 nm for the polished raw samples and increased to 23 nm after step
1 of coating. The roughness of the samples completely coated with
Mg–phenolic networks increased to 88, 90, 107, and 116 nm for
the 3.6%Mg@TA, 2.4%Mg@TA, 1.2%Mg@TA, and 0.6%Mg@TA samples, respectively.
The roughness values of the 2.4%Mg@TA and 3.6%Mg@TA samples were quite
similar. Moreover, the surface roughness decreased as the initial
concentration of Mg increased owing to smoothing at higher concentrations.

2.1.4 Wettability
The results of wettability
assessment are shown in Figure 2d. The average water contact angle of the raw samples was
∼88°. The NaOH coating decreased the water contact angle
by 41% compared to that of the raw samples (p <
0.001). It is also clear that regardless of the initial Mg concentration,
the addition of Mg–phenolic networks enhanced the hydrophilicity.
Hydrophilic surfaces with water contact angles of 20–40°
can reportedly provide the highest levels of cell attachment.35−38 As shown in Figure 2d, all of the coated samples exhibited moderate water contact angles
of 21–27°, which were significantly different from that
of the raw sample (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the
deposited Mg–phenol networks also significantly increased the
hydrophilicity compared to that of the NaOH coating (p < 0.001).

2.2 Corrosion Resistance Analysis
Figure 3a,b shows the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization (PDP)
curves. The Nyquist impedance spectra clearly show the kinetics of
electrochemical corrosion of the samples. Figure 3c shows the corresponding equivalent circuit
for the coated samples,39−41 where Rs, Qdl, Rct, Qp, and Rp represent the solution resistance, double-layer capacitance,
reaction resistance associated with the interfacial charge-transfer
reaction, coating capacitance, and coating resistance, respectively.
For the raw sample, Rct, Qp, and Rp were ignored. Using
the equivalent circuit and obtained EIS curves, curve fitting analysis
was performed using EC-Lab software; the corresponding data for each
element of the circuit were extracted and are summarized in Table 1. Rct is known to have the largest effect on the impedance
of the corrosion reaction.32 As shown in Table 1, the Rct value of the 0.6%Mg@TA sample was even lower than that
after the first step of coating (i.e., coating with NaOH), possibly
owing to cracking during the coating process (Figure 1). The increase in the Mg concentration caused
an increase in Rct. Therefore, it can
be concluded that the porous coating of Mg–phenolic networks
with the optimal Mg concentration can significantly enhance the corrosion
resistance of Mg-based alloys. The obtained curves from PDP tests
(Figure 3b) and the
corresponding values for the Ecorr and Icorr extracted from the polarization curves
using the Tafel method (Table 1) had almost the same trend as that of EIS curves (Figure 3a) and the Rct value among the considered samples (Table 1). The 2.4%Mg@TA and
3.6%Mg@TA samples delivered the lowest value for the corrosion current
density (Icorr) among all of the samples
(Table 1). The value
of the Icorr for these samples is almost
5 times lower than that of the raw sample. As far as Icorr is directly proportional to the corrosion activities,42 we can claim that the Mg–phenolic networks
with a proper coating procedure deliver proper electrochemical stability
and promote anticorrosion performance of the Mg-based substrate kinetically.
Moreover, the free corrosion potential (Ecorr) of the coated samples shifted toward the more positive potentials,
indicating the thermodynamic reaction activity of the coated samples
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was more suppressed compared to
that of the uncoated sample.42

samples.

Taken together, all of these results can be considered
as convincing
evidence to prove that performing Mg–phenolic network strategy
with a proper initial Mg concentration during the coating procedure
can serve a proper corrosion protection for the Mg-based substrate.
Furthermore, the Rct and Icorr values of the 2.4%Mg@TA and 3.6%Mg@TA samples were
all almost similar (Table 1), indicating that initial Mg concentrations exceeding 2.4%
would not further improve corrosion resistance.

2.3 Degradation Behavior
Figure 4a,b shows the Mg concentration
and the volume of H2 gas evolution within 3 weeks and at
five time points during immersion of the samples in PBS solution at
37 ± 0.5 °C, respectively. The raw sample clearly released
the highest quantity of Mg ions and hydrogen evolution, indicating
that it had the highest degradation rate. With increasing initial
Mg concentration in the coating procedure, the degradation rate decreased
that led to less release of Mg ions and hydrogen evolution. Additionally,
for all of the samples, the Mg concentration in the extracted solution
increased dramatically from day 1 to day 3 and then gradually increased
from day 3 to day 7. The reason may be the formation of insoluble
salty clusters on the sample surfaces, which decreased after the surface
area was exposed to the solution.43 It
is worth mentioning that the trend of changing in the quantity of
the measured hydrogen evolution (Figure 4b) are in agreement with that of the Mg concentration
(Figure 4a) in all
of the considered time points.

Figure 4 Variation of four different parameters
during 3 weeks degradation
of different samples in PBS solution at 37 ± 0.5 °C: (a)
concentration of released Mg element, (b) hydrogen gas evolution,
(c) pH value, (d) surface morphology; (e) energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) spectrum and weight% elemental quantitative data representative
of the insoluble cluster, the hydroxide layer, and substrate fragments.

Figure 4c shows
the pH of the collected PBS solution after immersion of the samples.
The differences in the degradation rates of the samples resulted in
differences in the hydroxide ion (OH–) release and
pH.4 The pH for the raw and 0.6%Mg@TA samples
reached 8.75 owing to the absence of a suitable passivation layer
for the raw sample and cracking that occurred during coating of the
0.6%Mg@TA sample. The NaOH-treated and 1.2%Mg@TA samples produced
moderate increases in pH to 8.70 and 8.74, whereas the 2.4%Mg and
3.6%Mg samples caused the smallest pH changes, to 8.34 and 8.40, respectively,
on day 1. As the immersion time increased to 3 days, the pH of all
of the samples increased. When the immersion time increased to 7 days,
a temporary hydroxide passivation layer that was thermodynamically
stable at pH values above 8.3 may have formed (Figure 4d).43 This layer
caused the degradation rate to increase more slowly and protected
against significant changes in the pH, especially for the raw sample. Figure 4d shows the surface
morphology of the samples after 7 days of immersion in PBS. Although
a more slatelike structure formed on the surface of the raw sample,
it still had a larger contact area than the coated samples owing to
severe cracking. Figure 4e shows the EDX profiles of the insoluble cluster shown in Figure 4d. Despite the formation
of cracks with submicron widths, the Mg–phenolic films with
different initial Mg concentrations were quite stable and decreased
the corrosion rate, especially for the 1.2%Mg@TA, 2.4%Mg@TA, and 3.6%Mg@TA
samples. Even the NaOH-treated sample maintained its nanoscale porous
coating on day 7 (Figure 4d). After day 7, the samples exhibited different degradation
rates. The Mg ion release of the raw sample continued to increase,
but the amount of release tended to be steady at days 15 and 21. For
the NaOH-treated sample, the release of Mg ions increased more slowly,
indicating better corrosion resistance compared to the raw sample.
For the samples coated with the Mg–phenolic networks, the degradation
rate decreased from day 7 to day 21. Figure 4e shows the EDX profiles of these hydroxide
films. However, the presence of dissolved chloride ions (Cl–) at high concentrations in the PBS solution, which mimicked that
of blood plasma,44 would accelerate the
corrosion rate of Mg and convert some of the temporary hydroxide coating
into soluble MgCl2, further increasing the exposed area.14 At high pH values, formation and dissolution
of the hydroxide layer are typically competing processes. Free Cl– ions played a prominent role in the increase in pH.
Furthermore, the cracks on the substrate released more Mg ions and
thus increased the pH to 9.23, 9.22, 9.24, 9.11, 9.06, and 9.0.3 for
the raw, NaOH, 0.6%Mg@TA 1.2%Mg@TA, 2.4%Mg@TA, and 3.6%Mg@TA samples,
respectively. The pH of the raw samples reached 9.36 at day 15, whereas
the pH of the modified samples decreased compared to that on day 7.
Insoluble salty clusters formed on the surface of the raw sample.
Despite the cracking, the coating layer was present and connected
to the substrate of the 2.4%Mg@TA and 3.6%Mg@TA samples. In contrast,
the Mg–phenolic networks were separated from the intermediate
layer of the 1.2%Mg@TA samples. A uniform porous oxidized layer was
formed on the surface of the 0.6%Mg@TA and NaOH-treated samples. However,
the 0.6%Mg@TA sample was more severely corroded than the NaOH sample
owing to its highly porous surface. This result indicates that the
Mg–phenolic coating was not stable enough to passivate the
substrate at day 15.

The cracks on the surfaces of all of the
samples were wider on
day 21 (Figure 4d),
and more phosphate-based cluster structures had formed. The 2.4%Mg@TA
and 3.6%Mg@TA samples still had stable Mg–phenolic networks.
In the 1.2%Mg@TA samples, the Mg–phenolic networks had begun
to peel off from the intermediate layer. The tiny and large clusters
of the 0.6%Mg@TA samples decreased the corrosion activity. The NaOH-treated
samples were divided into coated and uncoated areas as the intermediate
coating layer was removed from the Mg substrate. As on days 7 and
15, the morphology of the raw sample consisted of the oxidized substrate
and cluster structure. The pH of all of the samples on day 21 was
lower than that on day 15 owing to the precipitation of more insoluble
salty clusters containing phosphate on the surface of the samples
resulting from the high concentration of phosphate in the PBS solution.43 Furthermore, part of the Mg–phenolic
passivation film was still present on the 2.4%Mg@TA and 3.6%Mg@TA
samples.

Overall, the changes in Mg ion release, H2 gas evolution,
and pH were clearly consistent. In light of the surface morphology,
the intermediate and Mg–phenolic layers as well as the formation
of insoluble phosphate-based clusters were the main factors affecting
the degradation behavior.

2.4 In Vitro Osteocompatibility Assessment
2.4.1 Short-Term Cytotoxicity Assessment
Figure 5a summarizes
the results of short-term cytotoxicity assessment of the MC3T3-E1
cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay after 6, 12, and 24 h. Among all of the groups, the 2.4%Mg@TA
and 3.6%Mg@TA samples showed an acceptable level of viability during
the first 24 h of incubation of the bonelike cells, indicating that
they provide a suitable physiological ambient for stimulating cell
adhesion and proliferation. Figure 5b shows the pH values of the culture media containing
MC3T3-E1 cells added to the samples during 24 h. The initial pH value
of the control group (i.e., the clear medium with cells only) was
7.77 and varied between 7.78 and 7.92 during that time period. The
2.4%Mg@TA and 3.6%Mg@TA samples clearly caused the least fluctuation
in the pH of the culture medium, and the corrosion rate was stable.
Culture media with alkaline pH values of 8.40–8.50 support
the highest osteoblast viability in vitro.45−47 The average
pH values of the 2.4%Mg@TA and 3.6%Mg@TA samples during the first
day of cell culture were 8.42 and 8.39, respectively.

2.4.2 Morphology Assessment of MC3TC-E1 Cells
The morphological changes in the seeded MC3T3-E1 cells on the samples
were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging
to compare the effects of the Mg–phenolic coating on the adhesion
and proliferation of the bonelike cells.

Figure 6 presents SEM micrographs showing the morphology
of MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on the samples at the end days 1 and 3.
On day 1, the 3.6%Mg@TA, 2.4%Mg@TA, and 1.2%Mg@TA samples showed high
osteocompatibility, with cell attachment and suitable spreading owing
to the stable moderately alkaline pH and suitable surface wettability
of the protective coating.

Figure 6 SEM images of the morphology of MC3TC-E1 cells
cultured on different
samples at day 1 and day 3 of incubation.

On day 3, the morphology of cells cultured on the
samples indicated
cell proliferation. A few cells became attached to the raw and 0.6%Mg@TA
samples, indicating that they could not provide a suitable biocompatible
physiological environment for cell proliferation. In contrast, the
3.6%Mg@TA, 2.4%Mg@TA, 1.2%Mg@TA, and NaOH-treated samples exhibited
improved biocompatibility, with more cells and acceptable levels of
proliferation. Specifically, the 3.6%Mg@TA and 2.4%Mg@TA samples showed
the best osteocompatibility among all of the groups. The above results
were consistent with the short-term cytotoxicity assessment (Section 2.4.1), wettability
results (Section 2.1.4), and corrosion resistance experiment (Section 2.2). That is, the 3.6%Mg@TA
and 2.4%Mg@TA samples with the proposed porous osteocompatible Mg–phenolic
networks exhibited acceptable corrosion resistance by mitigating the
negative effect of excessive release of H2 bubbles and
exhibited suitable wettability for adhesion and proliferation of bonelike
cells.

2.4.3 Indirect Viability Assessment
Surface
properties such as roughness and wettability, the pH of the culture
medium, the concentration of Mg ions, and oxygen deficiency due to
the release of H2 gas bubbles can be considered to be the
four main parameters directly affecting the in vitro viability, in
particular, the medium-term cytocompatibility, of the Mg alloys. Indirect
viability assessment is a common method of evaluating the in vitro
medium-term osteoblastic cytocompatibility of such alloys and their
capacity to mitigate the effects of these surface properties, increase
of pH, and H2 gas evolution. That is, indirect viability
assessment can provide better information about the medium-term influence
of the degradation of Mg-based alloys on the surrounding physiological
environment in vitro. Therefore, to focus on the effect of the release
of Mg2+ ions on the viability of osteoblast-like cells,
indirect viability assessment of extracted media mixed with 1×
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) at a 1:1 ratio
was performed. The average pH values of the media collected from the
3.6%Mg@TA, 2.4%Mg@TA, 1.2%Mg@TA, 0.6%Mg@TA, NaOH-treated, and raw
samples were 8.12, 8.18, 8.25, 8.39, 8.30, and 8.41, respectively. Figure 7 shows the results
of the MTT assay after 1 and 3 days of cell culture with the prepared
culture medium for each group. The absorbance of all of the samples
obviously differed significantly from that of the control group (p < 0.001) on day 1. This finding confirms the stimulating
effect of Mg corrosion products (especially Mg2+ ions)
on the proliferation of bonelike cells reported by Wu et al.7 Furthermore, Galow et al.46 have reported that culture media with alkaline pH enhance
the viability of osteoblast-like cells in vitro. They claimed that
higher pH values of up to 8.4 cause the higher viability.

Figure 8 shows confocal
images of the morphology of the cultured MC3T3-E1 cells in the media
extracted on day 1. Among all of the groups, the highest numbers of
adhered and proliferated cells were observed on the raw and 0.6%Mg@TA
samples, which is consistent with the MTT results (Figure 7). On day 3, the same trend
as day 1 was observed for MTT results. There was still a significant
difference between the control group and the other groups (p < 0.001). The increase in the absorbance of all of
the groups from day 1 to day 3 indicates enhancement of the proliferation
mechanisms of the cells. The confocal images of the cells on day 3
are shown in Figure 9. The cells clearly proliferated well. The differences in cell proliferation
among the groups can be explained in terms of the difference in the
medium pH.

tomography (μCT) images obtained at 4 weeks after implantation
surgery. The blue circle indicates the initial size of the defects.

In summary, the indirect viability test showed
that the dose of
Mg ions from uncoated Mg-based alloys (i.e., the raw sample) resulted
in an alkaline pH in vitro, enhancing proliferation. Furthermore,
the 3.6%Mg@TA and 2.4%Mg@TA samples have not only an effective coating
of Mg–phenolic networks and the most osteocompatible surface
among all the groups, which results in reduced cytotoxicity, but also
can still release corrosion products, improving the viability of the
biological fluid in the zone around the implantation area.

2.5 In Vivo Implantation of Mg Disks in Rat
After the implantation surgery according to the procedure describes
in Section 4.8.2 (Figure 9a) and during
the 4 week period before the final surgery for harvesting the skull
bone blocks, all of the rats were in good health and showed wound
healing without any severe side effects.

2.5.1 Observation of Subcutaneous Hydrogen Gas
Cavity
For Mg-based implants with a higher degradation rate,
subcutaneous hydrogen gas cavities can be easily observed in the region
around the implantation area.6,16,17 Regardless of the size of the Mg-based implant, the formation of
such cavities can be considered convincing evidence for the high degradation
rate and undesirable corrosion resistance, which can limit the biocompatibility
of such biomaterials. In previous studies, for example, in Lin et
al.,48 photographs of the shaved skin covering
the defects in the calvarial region have been used to compare the
degradation behavior of different Mg-based implants. Figure 9b compares the formation of
subcutaneous hydrogen gas pockets in the uncoated and coated Mg implants
4 weeks after implantation. An obvious gas cavity formed in the implantation
area of the uncoated Mg disk. In contrast, no obvious gas pockets
formed near the Mg disks coated with Mg–phenolic networks,
indicating that the passivation coating decreased the degradation
rate of the Mg implants, allowing sufficient time for blood flow to
remove the created hydrogen gas bubbles in the implantation area and
prevent accumulation of these bubbles. Preventing or at least mitigating
the formation of H2 gas cavities can increase the oxygen
supply to the defect area and improve the biocompatibility of Mg-based
implants.

2.5.2 Micro-CT Findings
Figure 9c compares focused front and
back views of the reconstructed micro-CT images of defect area with
uncoated and coated Mg implants as well as the sham control group
obtained 4 weeks after implantation. Regardless of the volume of bone
formed around the Mg implant, the difference in the degradation of
the uncoated and coated samples is obvious. In the uncoated Mg implant,
some localized corrosion pits and/or holes were formed, indicating
a higher corrosion rate than that of the implants coated with Mg–phenolic
networks, on which there were no obvious voids or holes. The accumulation
of hydrogen gas near the uncoated sample can be attributed to these
corrosion features (Figure 9b). As the degradation rate increased, the formation of subcutaneous
gas pockets became more likely.

3 Conclusions
In this research, nanostructured
Mg–phenolic networks were
formed on a Mg-based alloy by dip-coating in a solution containing
Mg and phenol groups. The two main goals were to enhance the corrosion
resistance and osteocompatibility of Mg-based degradable implant materials.
The following results were obtained:(1) The concentration of Mg ions in the
coating solution was found to be the main factor affecting the performance
of the coating. The corrosion resistance increased with increasing
concentration of Mg ions in the coating solution. The corrosion resistance
of the 3.6%Mg@TA and 2.4%Mg@TA samples increased by 180% compared
to that of the raw sample.

(2) Observations of the degradation behavior
showed that the Mg–phenolic network coating can be quite stable
in the first few weeks of immersion in PBS solution.

(3) Direct short-term cytotoxicity assessment
indicated that the 3.6%Mg@TA and 2.4%Mg@TA coatings significantly
decreased the cytotoxicity of the Mg-based substrate in the first
day after implantation.

(4) SEM images of the morphology of osteoblast-like
cells showed that the Mg-based substrate with a suitable coating of
Mg–phenolic networks had an osteocompatible surface that significantly
enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation in the first few days after
cell seeding.

(5) Indirect
medium-term viability assessment
showed that the media extracted from even the samples with the highest
Mg concentration in the passivation coating (i.e., 3.6%Mg@TA and 2.4%Mg@TA)
enhanced the viability of the bonelike cells.

(6) In vivo animal experiments revealed
that coating Mg-based implants with appropriate passivation layers
containing Mg–phenolic networks can control the degradation
rate of the implants and mitigate the formation of subcutaneous hydrogen
gas cavities in the implantation area.



Overall, passivation of Mg-based alloys with 3.6%Mg@TA
and 2.4%Mg@TA
coating solutions produced a surface with excellent osteocompatibility
that protected the alloys from severe degradation and prevented the
formation of excessive H2 gas bubbles and the resulting
oxygen deficiency. Thus, our coating procedure with Mg–phenolic
networks shows promise for widening the application of Mg-based degradable
implants for bone regeneration.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Substrate Preparation
Casted ingots
of Mg–2.8%Zn alloy were extruded to billets with a diameter
of 10 mm. Then, the samples with a diameter of 6 mm and a thickness
of 1 mm were machined from the extruded billets. All of the mentioned
fabrication processes were carried out in Shaanxi Key Laboratory of
Biomedical Metal Materials of Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal
Research (Xi’an, China). Afterward, the disks were polished
with SiC papers down to 4000 grit. Then, all of the samples were ultrasonically
cleaned in 100% acetone (10 min) and 100% ethanol (10 min) and finally
rinsed in deionized (DI) water to remove any surface contaminations.49

4.2 Mg–Phenolic Network Deposition
The coating procedure is summarized schematically in Figure 10. The Mg–phenolic networks were coated on disk samples
in two steps. In the first step, the prepared Mg–2.8%Zn disks
were immersed in NaOH with a pH of 10 for 90 min. A uniform nanosized
film of Mg oxides [both Mg(OH)2 and MgO] can form on Mg
substrates immersed in NaOH solution.32,50 Then, the
samples were dip-coated in a prepared solution containing 1 mg mL–1 TA (analytical grade, purity = 99%, Sigma-Aldrich)
combined with MgCl2 (analytical grade, purity = 99%, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Australia) at four concentrations (0.6, 1.2, 2.4,
and 3.6 mg mL–1) in NaOH solution (pH = 10). After
30 min, the samples were removed and washed 3 times with the NaOH
solution to remove any salty liquid from their surfaces. In the second
step, this procedure was repeated using a fresh solution to perform
the second and third cycles and to form a uniform Mg–polyphenolic
network surface. To reduce undesirable oxidation, the coated samples
were kept in a vacuum desiccator. The NaOH + 1% TA + 3.6% MgCl2, NaOH + 1% TA + 2.4% MgCl2, NaOH + 1% TA + 1.2%
MgCl2, NaOH + 1% TA + 0.6% MgCl2, and NaOH coating
solutions and the samples coated with them are denoted 3.6%Mg@TA,
2.4%Mg@TA, 1.2%Mg@TA, 0.6%Mg@TA, and NaOH, respectively.

of the assembly of Mg–phenolic networks on Mg-based
alloys.

4.3 Surface Morphology Assessment of the Mg–Phenolic
Film
To observe the surface morphology of the coated samples
after the coating procedure mentioned in Section 4.2, the samples were coated with a thin layer
(∼10 nm) of gold using a sputter (EM SC005 Gold Coater, Leica).
Then, the surface morphology of the different samples was observed
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 7001F, Japan). A secondary
electron detector (SED) was used to capture the detailed shape and
surface information. Parallel samples were prepared to observe the
cross-sectional view of the coated samples. To that aim, the samples
were mounted inside the epoxy resin and after the cutting and polishing
procedures the cross section of the samples was coated with a very
thin layer (∼4 nm) of platinum using a sputter (EM ACE600 Platinum
Coater, Leica). Finally, the cross-sectional view of the coating layer
of the different samples was captured using SEM (SEM, JEOL 7001F,
Japan). Backscattered electron (BSE) imaging was applied to extract
chemical contrast information.

4.4 Surface Characterization of the Mg–Phenolic
Film
The chemical composition of the sample surfaces was
examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using the XPSpeak
4.1 package to analyze the high-resolution spectra and fit the peaks
to bonding states. The wettability of the surfaces was assessed by
conducting a simple water contact angle test at room temperature and
50% relative humidity using the sessile-drop method on an inclined
plate. The roughness of the samples was quantified by atomic force
microscopy (AFM) in a scanning range of 20 × 20 μm2. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times for statistical
analysis.

4.5 Corrosion Resistance Assessment
The
effect of the Mg–phenolic coating on the corrosion resistance
was examined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with
an electrochemical unit (VSP, Bio-Logic Science Instruments, France)
sample as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode as
the reference electrode, and a platinum foil as the counter electrode.
Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution was used as the electrolyte.
The side and bottom surfaces of the disk samples were covered by silicon
glue, and only the top surface (28.3 mm2) was exposed to
the electrolyte. All of the tests were performed at 37 ± 0.5
°C. The EIS data were recorded from 200 kHz to 100 mHz with a
10 mV sinusoidal perturbing signal.33

Accordingly, the potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) tests were conducted
at a scanning rate of 1 mV s–1. Then, the Tafel
method with linear extrapolation of the active polarization zone in
the cathodic polarization section of PDP curves was applied to extract
the current density (Icorr) and corrosion
potentials (Ecorr).32 The EC-Lab software package (V11, Bio-Logic Science Instruments,
France) was applied to analyze the EIS and PDP results.

4.6 Degradation Behavior
The degradation
behavior was examined by immersing the samples in PBS solution (pH
= 7.4) for 3 weeks at 37 °C. The surface/volume ratio was 56
mm2 mL–1. The time checkpoints were set
as day 1, day 3, week 1, week 2, and week 3. The PBS solutions were
refreshed every 2 days with 500 μL of a fresh solution using
a method similar to that mentioned in refs (51) and (52). At the end of each interval, the concentration of Mg2+ ions released into the extracted PBS solution was determined
using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES
700, Agilent) after measuring the pH value of the extracted using
a pH meter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in each time checkpoints. Parallely,
similar samples were prepared to measure the evolution of H2 gas during the degradation of the samples in PBS with a test area
of 0.283 cm2 using an eudiometer and based on the methodology
presented in ref (32). For surface morphology assessment, the samples were ultrasonically
washed with distilled water for 5 min to remove the salty crystals
deposited on the surface from the PBS solution. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy
were used to assess the surface morphology and chemical composition
of the samples, respectively. Three samples were tested for each interval.

4.7 In Vitro Biological Tests
4.7.1 Osteoblast Cell Morphological Analysis
To study the in vitro osteocompatibility of the coated samples,
the cell morphology, adhesion, and proliferation of the MC3T3-E1 osteoblast
cell line (Sigma-Aldrich) on the coated samples were monitored. A
suspension of 8 × 103 cells in 1× Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum as well as 1% pericyte growth supplement was seeded on
the surfaces of the samples, which were held under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After the samples were cultured for 3 days, the culture
medium was extracted, and all of the samples were washed with PBS,
fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde for 30 min, and then washed again 3 times
with PBS. Next, the samples were dehydrated according to previous
protocols.53 Finally, the morphology of
the cells was observed using SEM (JEOL 7001F, Japan).

4.7.2 Direct Cytotoxicity Assessment
Three timelines (6, 12, and 24 h) were used, and 1.6 × 104 MC3T3-E1 cells were directly seeded on the samples.32 The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich, Australia) assay was conducted to assess
the cytotoxicity.54 Briefly, after cell
seeding, the samples were kept in the incubator at 37 °C and
5% CO2. Then, 15 μL of the MTT solution with a concentration
of 5 mg mL–1 was added to each well and incubated
at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h. Next, 150 μL of
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Fisher Scientific, U.K.) was added to each
well and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Finally, a microplate
reader (Benchmark Plus, Bio-Rad) at 570 nm was applied to measure
the absorbance. Simultaneously with the cell culture experiments,
parallel samples were prepared to measure the pH value of the culture
medium using a pH meter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to investigate
the change in pH with time.

4.7.3 Indirect Viability Assessment
The
MTT assay similar to that described in Section 4.7.2 was conducted to assess the cell viability.
Each sample was first soaked in 150 μL of the prepared culture
medium for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Then, the extracted
media were diluted with 1× DMEM to a 1:1 ratio and used for subsequent
experiments, including fixed-cell confocal imaging and viability assessment.
For confocal imaging, 1.6 × 104 MC3T3-E1 cells were
seeded on a round coverslip slide. At the same time, 8 × 103 MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded on a 96-well plate. Three wells
were used per group for each experiment. Fresh media were used as
the control groups in both experiments. The cells were cultured for
1 and 3 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2. At the end of each
timeline, the viability of each group of samples was assessed, and
the absorbance was measured using the procedure described in Section 4.7.2.

To investigate the cytoskeletal arrangement of the cells using multiphoton
confocal microscopy, similar samples in different groups were prepared
using the fixation protocol presented by Guo et al.55 and Marchesano et al.56 Briefly,
at the end of each time point, the culture medium was extracted and
the MC3T3-E1 cells were washed with 1× PBS and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde. Next, 0.1% Triton-X was added to permeabilize the
cells (1 h). Then, the cells were kept in tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated
phalloidin for 1 h. Finally, the cell nuclei were stained by incubation
in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 10 min at room temperature.

4.8 In Vivo Animal Tests
A total of 10
albino rats of the Wistar strain with initial weights of 350–375
g were used in the present work. Each rat was kept and housed in a
separate cage and fed with a standard diet and water. All animal procedures
including animal selection, preparation, and surgical protocol were
conducted based on protocols approved by the local ethical committee
and laboratory animal administration rules of China.

4.8.1 Study Design
On the basis of the
results of the material characterization and in vitro experiments,
an in vivo animal study was designed to investigate the effect of
the Mg–phenolic network coatings on the corrosion resistance
and biocompatibility of Mg-based implants using the rat calvarial
model. Two critical-sized defects each 5 mm in diameter were created
in the parietal bone of each rat calvarium. One defect was used as
the sham group, and a Mg disk was implanted on the other. Two types
of Mg disks were used: uncoated (raw) and coated with Mg–phenolic
networks at a Mg concentration of 3.6 mg mL–1. Five
rats were allocated to each of the two Mg implant groups for 4 weeks
of observation after surgery.

4.8.2 Surgical Procedure
The surgical
procedure was based on the steps mentioned in refs (48) and (57). The surgical procedure
was based on the steps mentioned in refs (40) and (41). Briefly, the rats were sedated in a chamber with 4% isoflurane
in 100% O2 and then anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection
of 15 mg kg–1 Zoletile and 10 mg kg–1 Rompun. Under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine hydrochloride containing
1:100 000 epinephrine, after disinfection with povidone iodine,
a middle skin incision was made on a shaved skin area on the skull
and a full-thickness flap was reflected. Under copious saline irrigation,
two standardized round defects each 5 mm in diameter were created
on the left and right lateral parietal bones of the rat skull using
a trephine bur. After the two critical-size calvarial bone defects,
a Mg disk with a diameter of 5 mm and thickness of 0.8 mm was implanted
in the right defect and the left defect was used as the sham group.
Then, the periosteum and shaved skin were repositioned and sutured
properly. After a healing period of 4 weeks, five rats in each group
were euthanized in a CO2 chamber. Subsequently, block sections
of the rat skull will were collected and fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde
solution.

4.8.3 Observation of Subcutaneous Hydrogen Gas
Cavity
Photographs of hydrogen gas accumulation in the implantation
area of the Mg disk and any subcutaneous hydrogen gas cavities that
formed within 4 weeks after implantation were obtained before the
animals were harvested.

4.8.4 Micro-CT Analysis
A micro-computed
tomography (μCT) scanner was chosen (μCT 40, Scanco Medical,
Brüttisellen, Switzerland) to assess the harvested and fixed
rats’ cranial bone blocks at an isotropic voxel size of 18
μm. The X-ray source voltage and current were controlled at
90 kV and 110 μA, respectively. Finally, the images were reconstructed
and processed using CTVox volume rendering software (Bruker).

4.9 Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analyses were performed via one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using
SigmaPlot ver13.0 (Systat Software, Inc.) software package.
