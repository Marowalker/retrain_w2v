This paper describes a disposable
amperometric biosensor for simple
and sensitive determination of miRNA-21. The bioplatform consists
of gold nanoparticles-nanostructured electrode surfaces on which a
direct hybridization assay involving the immobilization of a specific
thiolated DNA capture probe and recognition of the formed DNA–miRNA-21
heteroduplex by a specific antibody is implemented. The antibody is
further recognized through its Fc region by a commercial bacterial
protein containing 40 units of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (ProtA-polyHRP40).
The amperometric detection of the hybridization process using the
H2O2/hydroquinone system allows quantification
of the target miRNA in the 0.096–25 pM linear range with a
detection limit of 29 fM (0.29 amol in 10 μL of sample). The
bioplatform offers excellent selectivity against noncomplementary
sequences and very acceptable against sequences with an unpaired base
(only 30% of the response obtained for the target miRNA). In addition,
the bioplatform was shown to be useful for the determination of the
endogenous content of the target oncomiR directly in blood serum from
breast cancer patients and in breast cancer cells using only 10 ng
of total extracted RNA.

1 Introduction
Nanostructured electrodes
with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have
demonstrated unique properties in the development of nucleic acid
electrochemical biosensors with improved analytical performances.
The catalytic activity of the AuNPs together with their large surface
area and excellent biocompatibility make these nanostructured surfaces
more conductive and allow the immobilization of large probe loadings
with optimal orientation and spacing for efficient hybridization,
keeping their biological activity and storage stability.1−4 The resulting bioplatforms exhibit also interesting advantages in
terms of simplicity, cost, assay time, and applicability in different
environments. These characteristics make AuNPs-involved bioplatforms
especially attractive compared to conventional methodologies for their
implementation in routine determinations.

These properties have
been successfully harnessed to develop electrochemical
platforms for the determination of biomarkers of high clinical relevance,
such as miRNAs,5,6 a class of endogenous and small
noncoding RNAs that play a relevant role in many diseases, particularly
in human cancers.7,8 Alterations in miRNA expression
levels are involved in the initiation and progression of human cancers,
and minimal signature profiles have been identified for various types
of human cancers, where miRNAs can be regulated both upward and downward.
Therefore, the determination of regulatory patterns is of great importance
since they can provide relevant information about tumor initiation,
invasion, and metastasis processes.

However, the determination
of miRNAs is highly complex due to their
short sequence, low concentration level, and high sequence similarity
between members of the same family. Conventional available methods
for miRNAs determination, such as northern blotting,9,10 in situ hybridization, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction,11−13 and miRNA microarrays,14−17 suffer from important limitations (use in centralized
laboratories, expensive, laborious, require specialized personnel,
and poorly portable instrumentation), which make the development of
more simple and rapid alternative strategies highly desirable.

In recent years, several electrochemical platforms have been reported
for the single or simultaneous determination of miRNAs either using
integrated formats4,18−22 or involving magnetic beads (MBs).23−27 However, many of these biosensors require amplification
strategies, which demand complex and/or long protocols to achieve
the required sensitivity. This is an important restriction for their
wide use in clinical practice by unskilled personnel. In this context,
particularly attractive and relatively simple electrochemical strategies
have been reported recently with acceptable sensitivity using commercial
capture and detector bioreceptors with high affinity toward RNA homohybrids
(viral protein p194,28−31) and heterohybrids (anti-DNA–RNA
hybrid antibodies19−21,23,25,26).

This paper describes
a novel electrochemical bioplatform for miRNAs
determination, which combines the simplicity of a direct DNA–RNA
hybridization format with the advantages of disposable AuNPs-nanostructured
platforms and the high specificity and affinity of anti-DNA–RNA
hybrid antibodies. To achieve high sensitivity, an easily implementable
amplification strategy using a multienzyme bacterial protein able
to recognize the Fc region of the anti-DNA–RNA hybrid antibody
is used. The hybridization reaction is monitored amperometrically
with the H2O2/hydroquinone (HQ) system. The
resulting biosensor exhibits interesting performance in terms of sensitivity,
selectivity, and reduced fabrication and assay times. It was successfully
applied for the reliable and accurate determination of the selected
target miRNA-21 (a relevant onco-miRNA32) directly in a five-times diluted human blood serum from breast
cancer patients as well as in breast cancer cells using the lowest
amount of total extracted RNA reported to date for an electrochemical
biosensor.

2 Results and Discussion
The developed
strategy is displayed in Scheme 1. It involves direct RNA–DNA hybridization
implemented on disposable carbon surfaces nanostructured with AuNPs.
The target miRNA was selectively captured on the nanostructured surfaces
by efficient hybridization with a complementary thiolated DNA probe.
The resulting heterohybrid was recognized with an antibody with high
affinity for these heteroduplexes, which was labeled with a bacterial
binding antibody protein (ProtA) conjugated with a homopolymer containing
40 horseradish peroxidase (HRP) units. The extent of the hybridization
reaction and thus of the miRNA-21 concentration was monitored by amperometry
in the presence of the H2O2/HQ system. Interestingly,
both the nanostructured disposable surfaces and all necessary reagents
involved in this strategy are commercially available.

Figure 1 shows the
comparison of the amperometric traces recorded in the absence and
presence of the target miRNA at unmodified AuNPs/SPCEs and modified
with HS-DNA and HS-RNA capture probes. Negligible and similar amperometric
responses were observed in the absence of miRNA-21 on HS-DNA/AuNPs/SPCEs
and in the presence of 20 pM miRNA-21 on AuNPs/SPCEs with no immobilized
HS-DNA capture probe immobilized and on complementary HS-RNA/AuNPs/SPCEs
(Figure 1b). These
results confirmed that the amperometric responses were due to the
efficient hybridization of the HS-DNA capture probe with the target
miRNA, the negligible nonspecific adsorption of anti-DNA–RNA
hybrid antibody and ProtA-polyHRP40 on the AuNPs/SPCEs surface, and
the specificity of the antibody for the selective detection of DNA–RNA
heterohybrids.33−35

20 pM synthetic miRNA-21 at AuNPs/SPCEs with and without immobilized
HS-DNA probe (a) and in the presence of 20 pM miRNA-21 at AuNPs/SPCEs
modified with HS-DNA or HS-RNA probes complementary to miRNA-21 (b).

2.1 Optimization of the Experimental
Variables
The most relevant experimental variables affecting
the behavior
of the designed bioelectrode were optimized. The current measured
in the presence of 20 pM (signal, S) and in the absence (noise, N)
of the target miRNA-21 as well as the corresponding ratio (S/N ratio)
were used as selection criteria. The results obtained are shown in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 1. Apart from these,
other variables used involved in the modification of AuNPs/SPCE, such
as the HS-DNA probe concentration, the hybridization time with the
target miRNA,4,22 the pH value, the detection potential,
and the concentrations of H2O2 and HQ, were
taken from previous works.36−38

Figure 2a,b shows
the effect of the concentration of bioreagents used to carry out the
heterohybrid recognition and the enzymatic labeling on the biosensor
response. The 1/1000 and 1/50 dilutions of the anti-DNA–RNA
hybrid antibody and ProtA-polyHRP40 conjugate provided larger S/N
ratios, and therefore, they were selected for further work.

In an attempt to simplify the whole working protocol and reduce
the assay time, the influence of the number of steps involved in the
preparation of the biosensor on its analytical behavior was checked;
30 min incubation steps were assayed in all cases starting from the
preparation of HS-DNA/AuNPs/SPCEs. Figure 2c shows a comparison between the results
obtained with the following working protocols:One single incubation step with a mixture solution consisting
of the target miRNA, anti-DNA–RNA antibody, and ProtA-polyHRP40.

Two successive incubation steps: first with
the target
miRNA and thereafter with a mixture solution containing anti-DNA–RNA
antibody and ProtA-polyHRP40.

Three successive
incubation steps with the target miRNA,
anti-DNA–RNA antibody, and ProtA-polyHRP40.



Figure 2c shows
clearly that the protocol involving two successive incubation steps
provided a larger S/N current ratio. These results suggest that the
mixing of all of the bioreagents worsened the efficiency of the hybridization
process, whereas the anti-DNA–RNA antibody was better recognized
by ProtA-polyHRP40 when both reagents were incubated in homogeneous
solution. Once the optimal working protocol was selected, the influence
of the incubation time with the mixture of anti-DNA–RNA antibody
and ProtA-polyHRP40 to label the DNA/miRNA heteroduplex captured on
the electrode was evaluated. As it is shown in Figure 2d, there were no significant differences
for the nonspecific responses, but the specific current increased
notably with the incubation time up to 60 min. Accordingly, this incubation
time ensured an efficient labeling of the immobilized heterohybrids
and was selected for further studies.

2.2 Analytical
Characteristics
Figure 3 shows the amperometric
responses obtained for different concentrations of the synthetic target
miRNA as well as the corresponding calibration plot. As expected for
a direct hybridization assay, the Δi values
(measured as described in Section 4.5) increased linearly (correlation factor r: 0.998) with the miRNA-21 concentration from 0.096 to 25 pM, with
a slope value of 378 ± 7 nA pM–1. The limit
of detection (LOD), defined as the concentration of the analyte that
gives a signal that is significantly different from the blank, was
estimated from the signal of the blank plus 3 times the standard deviation
of the signal values for 10 independent amperometric measurements
obtained without target miRNA. The resulting LOD was 29 fM (0.29 amol
in 10 μL sample).

the standard deviation of three replicates.

A comparison of the analytical performance of the developed
biosensor
with that of other electrochemical biosensors reported for the determination
of miRNAs using also DNA–RNA heterohybrid-specific antibodies
is shown in Table 2. The LOD value provided by the developed biosensor is notably better
than that achieved with biosensors involving the use of magnetic microbeads23,26 and similar to that claimed using electrodes nanostructured with
carbon nanomaterials.19,20 Importantly, no application is
reported for this latter approach. The achieved LOD is also higher
than that given for the sensor using AuNP-modified glassy carbon electrode
(GCE) and applied for the determination in RNAt extracted
from rice seedlings.21 However, both the
fabrication and assay time of the developed sensor are remarkably
shorter than those required using these more sensitive strategies
(Table 2).

b % of the response obtained in comparison
to that of the target miRNA.

Interestingly, the designed bioscaffold provides about 7-times
enhanced sensitivity (55.3 vs 378 nA pM) and a 34-times lower LOD
value (0.29 vs 10 amol) than the performance exhibited by a magnetic
microbeads-based biosensor involving the same bioreagents.26 The improved performance can be attributed to
the inherent conductivity and catalytic activity of AuNPs and the
enhanced immobilization of nucleic acid probe with an adequate orientation
and spacing to improve the target accessibility at the nanostructured
surfaces.1−4 Indeed, the LOD achieved with this biosensor is rather similar to
the values claimed for other biosensors reported recently for the
amperometric determination of miRNAs at AuNPs/SPCEs using competitive
and direct RNA/RNA hybridization assays using Strep-HRP and the viral
protein p19, respectively.4−22 Importantly, as shown below, the sensitivity achieved is sufficient
to allow quantification using a significantly small amount of extracted
RNAt. Moreover, the higher stability of DNA probes compared
to RNA probes can be considered as another relevant practical advantage
of the developed methodology.39

The
reproducibility of the measurements carried out with the developed
bioplatform was checked by comparing the currents obtained for 1 pM
miRNA-21 with nine different biosensors prepared in the same manner.
A relative standard deviation value of 2.9% was calculated to show
an excellent reproducibility in both the biosensor preparation and
amperometric measurement procedures.

Regarding the storage stability
of the bioplatforms, the currents
measured with HS-DNA/AuNPs/SPCEs, which were stored at 4 °C in
a humidified chamber (after incubation with 1% (w/v) bovine serum
albumin (BSA)), for 0 and 1.0 pM miRNA-21 showed that they remained
within the set control limits over a 2 month period (no longer times
were tested) (Figure 4). This attractive storage stability, in good agreement with the
behavior observed for bioelectrodes involving thiolated RNA probes
at disposable AuNP-nanostructured scaffolds,4,22 is
attributed to the great biocompatibility and major role played by
AuNPs in keeping the activity of the biomolecules immobilized onto
their surface.

Figure 4 Storage stability of HS-DNA/AuNPs/SPCEs at 4 °C in
a humidified
chamber. Amperometric signals provided by biosensors prepared with
the bioplatforms stored at different times in the absence and presence
of 1 pM synthetic miRNA-21. Control limits were set at ±3 ×
SD of the mean current values measured with five different sensors
prepared on the first day of the study.

2.3 Selectivity
Due to the high sequence
homology between miRNA family members, a very important feature of
miRNAs biosensing platforms is the selectivity toward other nontarget
and mismatched miRNA sequences. Figure 5 displays amperometric traces provided by the HS-DNA/AuNPs/SPCEs
in the absence and presence of the synthetic target miRNA, a single-central
base mismatched (1-m) and a fully noncomplementary miRNA (miRNA-451).
A very small response similar to that measured without target miRNA
was obtained for the noncomplementary sequence. The 1-m sequence provided
a 30% response of that obtained for the target miRNA. These findings
are of particular interest for the applicability of the method in
challenging samples, such as raw cellular RNAt, where the
target miRNA is present with many other nontarget miRNAs. The selectivity
achieved toward 1-m sequences (30% hybridization efficiency assigning
100% for the target miRNA) is better than that demonstrated for other
electrochemical biosensors using anti-RNA–DNA hybrid antibodies
(4826 and 51%23) requiring similar assay times, while it is slightly worse (30 vs
14%) than that claimed for the strategy requiring an assay time 3
times longer.21

Figure 5 Amperometric traces recorded
with HS-DNA/AuNPs/SPCEs in the absence
of the target miRNA and in the presence of 20 pM miRNA-21, 1-m and
noncomplementary (miRNA-451) sequences.

2.4 Determination of the Endogenous Content of
miRNA-21 in Serum from Breast Cancer Patients and RNAt Extracted
from Breast Cancer Cells
The practical suitability of the
developed methodology was tested by determining the endogenous content
of miRNA-21 directly in blood serum from breast cancer patients and
in raw RNAt extracted from breast cancer cells.

Figure 6a shows the amperometric
traces recorded with the developed biosensors for the three serum
samples analyzed (one from a healthy individual and two from patients
diagnosed with breast cancer). The samples were five-times diluted
and heated, as described in Section 4.6. These results are in agreement with those
reported by other authors40 showing that
miRNA-21 expression is about 3–4 times larger in breast cancer
patients that in healthy individuals using an indirect highly liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (MS)/MS method.41 No significant differences were found for the
slope values of the calibration plot constructed with miRNA-21 standards
(Figure 3, 378 ±
7 nA pM–1) and of the calibration graphs constructed
for five-times diluted and heated sera from the healthy individual
(374 ± 8 nA pM–1) and the breast cancer patients
353 ± 8 nA pM–1 spiked with growing amounts
of synthetic miRNA-21 up to 20 pM. This made the determination of
the endogenous concentration of the target miRNA in serum feasible
by simple interpolation of the Δi values measured
for the diluted samples into the miRNA standards calibration plot.
The concentrations of miRNA-21 obtained were 2.0 ± 0.2, 8.0 ±
0.3, and 7.3 ± 0.4 pM in the serum samples from the healthy individual
and breast cancer patients 1 and 2, respectively.

Figure 6 Amperometric responses
measured with HS-DNA/AuNPs/SPCEs in the
absence of the target miRNA and for five-times diluted and heated
serum samples (a) or 10 ng raw RNAt extracted from breast
cells (b).

Regarding the determination of
miRNA-21 in cellular extracted RNAt, Figure 6b
shows the amperometric traces provided by the HS-DNA/AuNPs/SPCEs showing
the expected miRNA-21 3–4 times higher expression in the tumorigenic
(MCF-7) compared to the nontumorigenic (MCF-10A) cells according to
the oncogenic role of this miRNA.41,42 Similar to
that observed in diluted and heated serum samples, no statistically
significant differences were found between the slope values of the
corresponding calibration plots constructed with the synthetic target
miRNA-21 both in buffered solutions and in the presence of 10 ng of
RNAt extracted from MCF-10A cells 354 ± 9 nA pM–1, thus confirming the absence of apparent matrix effect
in the cellular RNAt analysis. Interpolation in the miRNA-21
standard calibration plot provided concentrations of 0.82 ± 1.05
and 2.97 ± 3.22 amol ng–1 RNAt in
MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells, respectively. These results are in complete
agreement with those reported previously with concentrations ranging
from 0.8 to 1.0 amol ng–1 RNAt in MCF-10A
and from 2.3 to 3.3 amol ng–1 RNAt in
MCF-7 cells.4,23,43,26 These results demonstrate the bioplatform
usefulness for the accurate and selective determination of the target
miRNA in the presence of many other nontarget miRNAs. Importantly,
this determination can be accomplished using the lowest amount of
raw RNAt reported so far with electrochemical biosensors,4,24,26,27,29,30,44 which required between 50 and 1000 ng of RNAt extracted from cells to perform the target miRNA determination.

3 Conclusions
This work reports a novel amperometric
bioplatform to determine
miRNA-21. Combining the inherent advantages of disposable surfaces
nanostructured with gold nanoparticles with the use of selective antibodies
to DNA–RNA heteroduplexes and bacterial immunoglobulin-binding
protein conjugated to multiple HRP units made this determination possible
with an LOD as low as 29 fM and good discrimination toward sequences
with a single unpaired base. Interestingly, this bioplatform is able
to accurately determine the endogenous content of miRNA-21 directly
in human blood serum from breast cancer patients and in breast cancer
cells using very small amount of RNAt. It should be emphasized
that no target miRNA amplification steps are required with this strategy.
In addition, all of the reagents and disposable electrodes used are
commercially available, making this bioscaffold particularly attractive
to be handled by nonspecialized personnel and even on an outpatient
basis for routine determinations.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Apparatus and Electrodes
Amperometric
measurements were performed with a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT M204 electrochemical
workstation using Nova v1.11 software. The transducers, purchased
from Dropsens S.L. (Oviedo, Spain), were AuNP-modified screen-printed
carbon electrodes (ref DRP-110GNP) consisting of a 4 mm diameter working
electrode, a carbon counter electrode, and a Ag pseudoreference electrode
and the specific cable connector with the potentiostat (ref DRP-CAC).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization studies carried
out both by us and by the electrode supplier company confirm the presence
of AuNPs homogeneously distributed over the whole surface with a mean
diameter of 30 nm.

A Bunsen AGT-9 Vortex, a Raypa steam sterilizer,
a Telstar Biostar biological safety cabinet, an Optic Ivymen System
incubator shaker (Comecta S.A., Sharlab), and a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
were employed.

4.2 Reagents and Solutions
Highest available
grade reagents were used. NaH2PO4, Na2HPO4, NaCl, and KCl were purchased from Scharlab. Tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
hydrochloride (Tris–HCl), mercaptohexanol (MCH), hydroquinone,
H2O2 (30%, w/v), ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Germany).

ProtA-polyHRP40, a native ProtA labeled with a homopolymer
containing 40 HRP molecules (antibodies-online), and an anti-DNA–RNA
hybrid antibody (AbS9.6) from Kerafast (Boston, MA) were commercially
available. A commercial blocker solution, consisting of a phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) containing 1% w/v purified casein, from Thermo Scientific
(Waltham, MA) was also used.

The buffer solutions were prepared
with Milli-Q water (18 MΩ
cm at 25 °C) and sterilized after their preparation to avoid
RNase degradation. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) consisted of 0.01
M phosphate-buffered solution containing 137 mM NaCl and 2.7 mM KCl
(pH 7.5), Tris–EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) formed by mixing 10 mM
Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.3 M NaCl (pH 8.0), and phosphate
buffer (0.05 M, pH 6.0) were used.

The synthetic oligonucleotides
used (sequences shown in Table 3) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). Once received, they were reconstituted in
nuclease-free water to give a final concentration of 100 μM
and stored at −80 °C divided into small aliquots.

4.3 Preparation of HS-DNA/AuNPs/SPCEs
Immobilization of HS-DNA onto AuNPs/SPCEs was carried out following
the protocol described in our previous works.4,22 Briefly,
a 10 μL aliquot of a 0.05 μM DNA capture probe solution
was incubated over the working electrode in a humidified chamber (8
h, 4 °C). After washing thoroughly with water and drying with
nitrogen, the HS-DNA/AuNPs/SPCEs was treated with 10 μL of 0.1
mM MCH and 1% (w/v) BSA solutions (both prepared in Tris–EDTA,
pH 8.0) for 5 min and 1 h, respectively.

4.4 Hybridization
with the Target miRNA and Labeling
of the DNA/RNA Heteroduplex with Anti-RNA–DNA Antibodies and
ProtA-PolyHRP40
A 10 μL aliquot of the synthetic target
miRNA or the sample (heated and diluted serum or RNAt extracted
from cells, all in sterilized PBS, pH 7.5) solution was incubated
onto the HS-DNA/AuNPs/SPCEs at room temperature for 30 min to hybridize
the target miRNA with the immobilized DNA probe. Thereafter, electrodes
rinsed with sterilized water and dried with nitrogen were 60 min incubated
with 10 μL of a mixture solution containing anti-RNA–DNA
hybrid antibody and ProtA-polyHRP40, 1/500 and 1/25 diluted, respectively.
This mixture solution, prepared in blocker casein solution, was preincubated
for 30 min in an incubator shaker (30 °C, 950 rpm). The modified
bioelectrodes were rinsed with sterilized water and dried with nitrogen.
To prevent miRNA degradation by RNases, all manipulations, except
the amperometric measurements, were made in a laminar flow cabinet.

4.5 Amperometric Detection
Amperometric
detection at an applied potential of −0.20 V versus Ag pseudoreference
electrode was carried out in stirred solutions by immersing the prepared
bioelectrodes into an electrochemical cell containing 10 mL of 0.05
M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and freshly prepared 1.0 mM HQ. Once the
background current was stabilized, 50 μL of a 0.1 M H2O2 solution was added and the current was recorded for
about 100 s until reaching the steady-state current. The Δi values given corresponded to the difference between the
currents measured in the presence and absence of the target miRNA
and are the average of three replicates (α = 0.05).

4.6 Application for the Analysis of Serum and
Breast Cells-Extracted RNAt
The developed bioplatform
was used for the determination of the endogenous miRNA-21 content
directly in human serum samples (without previous RNAt extraction)
and in RNAt extracted from epithelial nontumorigenic and
tumorigenic breast cells. Blood serum samples were provided by Prof.
Besma Loueslati (Department of Biology, University of Tunis El Manar)
and collected from informed consenting patients according to ethical
guidelines. Serum samples corresponded to healthy individuals and
breast cancer patients. A serum aliquot was five-times diluted with
the sterilized PBS (pH 7.5) solution and heated for 15 min at 95 °C
(in a Stuart block heater) to release the miRNAs from microparticles
and exosomes.18 Subsequently, a 10 μL
aliquot of the diluted and heated sample was cast onto HS-DNA/AuNPs/SPCEs
and the protocol described in Section 4.4 for the synthetic target miRNA was followed.

Cell culture and RNAt extraction were performed following
protocols described previously.29,30 The quality and concentration
of the extracted RNAt were confirmed by measuring the absorbance
at appropriate wavelengths.
