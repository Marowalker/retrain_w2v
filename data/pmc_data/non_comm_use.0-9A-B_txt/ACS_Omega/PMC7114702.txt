Poly(ethylene
glycol) passivated graphene quantum dots (PEG-GQDs)
were synthesized based on a green and effective strategy of the hydrothermal
treatment of cane molasses. The prepared PEG-GQDs, with an average
size of 2.5 nm, exhibit a brighter blue fluorescence and a higher
quantum yield (QY) (up to approximately 21.32%) than the QY of GQDs
without surface passivation (QY = 10.44%). The PEG-GQDs can be used
to detect and quantify paramagnetic transition-metal ions including
Fe3+, Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Mn2+. In the case of ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) solution as a masking agent, Fe3+ ions can
be well selectively determined in a transition-metal ion mixture,
following the lowest limit of detection (LOD) of 5.77 μM. The
quenching mechanism of Fe3+ on PEG-GQDs belongs to dynamic
quenching. Furthermore, Fe3+ in human serum can be successfully
detected by the PEG-GQDs, indicating that the green prepared PEG-GQDs
can be applied as a promising candidate for the selective detection
of Fe3+ in clinics.

Introduction
GQDs are well known
as a distinguished candidate for metal-ion
analysis due to its small size, good biocompatibility, and easy chemical
modification of the surface, which implies a good potential application
in the fields of environmental detection, biological imaging, drug
carrier, and photocatalytic and electrocatalytic technology.1−5

Toxicity presents a common practical problem in traditional
QDs
containing CdS, CdSe, CdTe, and PbS that limit their application in
biomedicine.6−8 Therefore, it is necessary to choose a green and
nontoxic material as a carbon resource to prepare GQDs. Some biomass
materials such as durian,9 rice husks,10 etc. are chosen as carbon resources owing to
their low price, easy access, and eco-friendliness.

GQDs can
be prepared by top-down and bottom-up approaches. The
“top-down” synthesis involves stripping large carbon
sources into very small quantum dots by physical or chemical means.
The “bottom-up” synthesis, as opposed to the top-down
synthesis, uses very small carbon materials such as molecular or ionic
states to produce quantum dots.11,12 The characteristics
of luminescent color adjustment, dimensional dependence, pH dependence,
excitation wavelength dependence, and solvent dependence associated
with these preparation methods have been reported.13 Although the research on GQDs has made tremendous progress,
many problems need to be solved. The design of high-fluorescence quantum
yield (QY) GQDs and the improvement of physicochemical properties
of GQDs remain a challenging research task, which severely limits
its practical application. To enhance the performance of GQDs, surface
treatment is present to revise the GQDs surface with chemicals with
functional groups. Surface treatment with various molecules has been
developed as a facile and cost-effective approach to manipulate the
properties of GQDs in recent years.14,15 Sun et al.16 reported that the QY of GQDs modified with amino
groups is six times higher than that of unmodified GQDs. The results
show that only a few defect-free GQDs generate band gap fluorescence
in the limited size sp2 region, and most GQDs inevitably
introduce surface defects in the preparation process. These defects
on the surface will form many level traps or surface state energy
levels, which will become nonradiative recombination centers of electron
and hole, leading to a decrease in luminous efficiency. The surface
of quantum dots was usually modified to eliminate the defect state
luminescence caused by surface defects and improve luminous efficiency.

Ferric ion (Fe3+), as the main form of iron elements,
can be combined with a variety of proteins. However, Fe3+ is detrimental when present in excess in vivo, causing a variety
of diseases. Hence, the monitoring of Fe3+ is of great
significance in life. So far, a variety of methods have been introduced
and developed for the detection of Fe3+, involving REDOX
titration, gravimetric method, and spectrophotometric method. However,
the shortcomings of these methods, such as long test cycle, multiple
analysis steps, wastage of reagents, and interference of impurities
in the determination results, limit their usage. Therefore, effective
improvement in terms of detection technology is essential.

In
this paper, we report our work on the preparation of GQDs using
cane molasses, an environment-friendly as well as economically inexpensive
natural waste biomass, as carbon source, and surface modification
of PEG (PEG-GQDs) was carried out by a facile and rapid method. The
modified GQDs show stronger fluorescence, higher QY, and better stability
than the unmodified synthetic GQDs. Moreover, the fluorescence quenching
and the selectivity of PEG-GQDs for the detection of Fe3+ were also investigated.

Results and Discussion
Morphology and Composition
of the PEG-GQDs
Different
conditions were tested for the best performance of GQDs, and it was
found that a volume ratio of 1:16 (Vcane molasses/Vultrapure water), reaction temperature
of 190 °C, and the reaction time of 24 h yielded the best result,
so this condition was used throughout the present work (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of the synthesized GQDs and PEG-GQDs
in Figure 1 demonstrate
that both GQDs and PEG-GQDs are present with nearly spherical morphology.
The average particle size of PEG-GQDs (Figure 1b) appears to be similar to that of GQDs
(Figure 1a), but the
dispersion of PEG-GQDs is better than that of GQDs. The GQDs exhibit
an average diameter of 2.2 nm when counting about 100 particles ranging
from 1.1 to 3.2 nm (Figure 1c). For PEG-GQDs, the particle size was found to range from
1.5 to 3.5 nm with an average lateral size of about 2.5 nm (Figure 1d). High-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) images show that the graphitic lattice of both GQDs (the
inset of Figure 1a)
and PEG-GQDs (the inset of Figure 1b) possesses a lattice spacing of 0.21 nm, which are
assigned to the (100) of graphitic carbon, suggesting a highly uniform
crystallinity of the produced GQDs and PEG-GQDs.17

of (c) GQDs and (d) PEG-GQDs; and (e) atomic force microscopy (AFM)
image of GQDs.

The AFM image in Figure 1e displays that the maximum
thickness of the GQDs is no more
than 2.7 nm, corresponding to three to eight layers of graphene.

Figure 2a displays
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of GQDs and PEG-GQDs,
with assignments of functional groups of the GQDs and PEG-GQDs labeled.
The broad band in 3402 and 3302 cm–1 corresponds
to the stretching vibration of O–H. The weak peaks at 1631
and 1656 cm–1 are related to C=C skeletal
vibrations.18,19 Compared to the GQDs FTIR spectrum,
three additional peaks at 2875, 1346, and 1079 cm–1 emerge in PEG-GQDs in the FTIR spectrum, which is due to the stretching
vibration, bending vibration of C–H, and the stretching vibration
of C–O, respectively.20,21 These results verified
that hydroxyl, carbon–hydrogen bond, and carbon–oxygen
were present in the PEG-GQDs sample.

of PEG-GQDs recorded for progressively longer excitation wavelengths
from 280 to 480 nm. (h) Diameter histogram of the effect of adding
an amount of PEG on the fluorescence emission spectra of PEG-GQDs.

The XPS survey scan spectrum of the PEG-GQDs is
shown in Figure 2b,
which displays
two binding energy peaks at 285 and 532 eV, corresponding to C 1s
and O 1s, respectively. The C 1s spectrum shown in Figure 2c can be deconvoluted into
three components at 284.2, 285.3, and 286.6 eV, which are attributed
to the C–C/C–H, C–OH, and C=O, respectively.22 The O 1s spectrum (Figure 2d) shows two major components at 531.5 and
532.2 eV, which are related to the O=C and HO–C groups,
respectively.20 These functionalities of
PED-GQDs are consistent with the infrared spectroscopic analysis results,
indicating that PEG was coated effectively on the surface of GQDs.

Optical Properties and Stability of PEG-GQDs
UV–vis
absorption and fluorescence spectra of the PEG-GQDs were also collected
at room temperature to study the effect of surface modification of
PEG on optical properties, and the results are shown in Figure 2e. Both GQDs and PEG-GQDs have
an absorption peak near 260 nm, which is assigned to the π–π
* transition of the C=C bond.21,23 In contrast,
the absorption peak at 260 nm of the PEG-GQDs has a more obvious variation
tendency, which may be due to the fact that the polarity of water
is stronger than that of PEG, since the strong polar solvent may entail
the spectrum fine structure from the vibration effect to disappear
and produce a wide peak.24

The excitation
and emission fluorescence spectra of the GQDs and PEG-GQDs are displayed
in Figure 2f. A fluorescence
emission peak was observed at 440 nm for GQDs, and a fluorescence
emission peak was observed at 445 nm when PEG-GQDs were excited at
376 nm. The emission peak position of PEG-GQDs appeared to shift to
red compared to the GQDs emission peak, which suggests that the electronic
state of the GQDs was affected by the coating of PEG. The electrons
on the GQDs layer can easily jump to the PEG layer. However, the holes
that should have been paired with these electrons can only stay on
the surface of the GQDs, resulting in a relatively small separation
of electrons from the holes. This small separation reduces the binding
energy of excitons formed, leading to the red shift of PEG-GQDs peak
position.25

The relationship between
the fluorescence emission peak position
of GQDs and PEG-GQDs and the excitation wavelength was investigated
by exciting at different excitation wavelengths from 280 to 480 nm
in an interval of 20 nm. The emission wavelength positions are found
to red shift with increasing excitation wavelength, and the fluorescence
intensity shows an increasing trend from 280 to 380 nm then decreasing
from 380 to 480 nm. The GQDs can reach the maximum fluorescence intensity
at an excitation wavelength near 360 nm (Figure S2a, Supporting Information); nevertheless, the maximum excitation
wavelength of PEG-GQDs is around 380 nm (Figure 2g). Thus, both GQDs and PEG-GQDs also show
a typical excitation wavelength dependence of the luminescence.

The fluorescence intensity of PEG-GQDs was found to increase by
40% in comparison to that of GQDs. PEG is selected to modify the defected
surface of GQDs to eliminate the defect state luminescence and to
create more exciton luminescence, thereby improving the luminescence
efficiency of GQDs. Some studies have shown that different GQDs luminescence
colors are related to multitudinous carbon sources (such as carbon
fiber, graphite, and graphene oxide).26−28 The luminescence of
PEG-GQDs derived from cane molasses in the present work is dominated
by indigo blue light. The inset in Figure 2f is the fluorescence photographs of the
PEG-GQDs on the right side and the GQDs on the left side under the
UV lamp (λ = 365 nm); as can be seen, PEG-GQDs can emit brighter
indigo blue fluorescent light in comparison to GQDs. The highest fluorescence
QY of the obtained PEG-GQDs was determined to be 21.32%, which is
much higher than that of the GQDs (10.44%) and the previous report
of C-dots (5.8%),29 which also focuses
on cane molasses as a carbon source. This implied that the effective
passivation of GQDs surfaces with PEG significantly enhanced the fluorescence
QY of GQDs. Moreover, the PEG capping on the outside of GQDs was found
to change the fluorescence decay lifetime of GQDs. The fluorescence
lifetime of GQDs is prolonged from 2.09 to 2.25 ns (as shown in Table 1). This may be the
result of the conjugated aromatic structure of GQDs being modified
by PEG, forming an electron delocalization field by combining the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PEG ligand
with the conductive band-edge energy of GQDs. The excited electron
of PEG-GQDs with a more stable environment was supplied from the electron
delocalized field, thus the fluorescence lifetime of PEG-GQDs is prolonged.30

PEG-GQDs-Fe3+	1.36	4.17	36 188.45	2212.06	1.80	
To explore the effect of PEG addition on the luminescence
efficiency
of PEG-GQDs, different dilution factors were chosen to passivate the
surface of GQDs. It was found that the fluorescence intensity was
the highest when the GQDs solution was diluted 50 times with PEG (Figure 2h). It seemed that
a complete encapsulation of GQDs defects was not achieved when the
PEG content is too low, and the excessive amount of PEG may affect
the emission of the characteristic peak of GQDs, giving rise to lower
fluorescence intensity.

PEG is widely used in the field of biomedicine
because of its biocompatibility,
nontoxicity, antigen-free, and nonimmune characteristics.31 PEG comprises two chemical groups: one is hydrophilic
polar groups and the other is oily nonpolar groups.32 When the surface of GQDs is modified by PEG, the nonpolar
pro-oil groups are adsorbed to the surface of GQDs by the exchange
of coordination bonds, which allows good permeability and good biocompatibility
of cells. The polar hydrophilic group is compatible with water; the
surface modification of GQDs by PEG can also reduce the surface tension
of the GQDs, which changes its surface properties and makes the PEG-GQDs
more stable. On the other hand, the long tail end can form spatial
resistance to water molecules on the surface of PEG-GQDs, which results
in PEG-GQDs in the water to have a large repulsive volume, thus preventing
the agglomeration of GQDs.33 Thus, the
surface modification of PEG can also result in good water solubility,
good dispersion, and few defects in luminescent materials, which contribute
to improving the stability and the fluorescence efficiency of GQDs;
the function mechanism of PEG is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Schematic illustration of the function of PEG
for GQDs.

ζ-potential is an important
index to characterize the stability
of product dispersion. The lower the absolute value of the ζ-potential,
the more molecules or particles in the system coagulate.34 The ζ-potential plot in Figure 4a shows that PEG-GQDs show
two peaks at 30 and 70 mV in the positive electric region, while GQDs
display only one peak at −7 mV in the negative electric region.
Clearly, PEG-GQDs show a bigger potential than the negatively charged
GQDs in terms of absolute value, indicating that PEG-GQDs have better
stability compared to that of GQDs. Figure 4b demonstrates the fluorescence intensity
change of PEG-GQDs and GQDs within 35 days, the less change in the
fluorescence intensity of PEG-GQDs further demonstrates that the stability
of PEG-GQDs is significantly better than that of GQDs.

Figure 4 (a) ζ-potentials
of GQDs and PEG-GQDs. (b) Stability of GQDs
and PEG-GQDs for 35 days. (c) Fluorescence emission spectra of passivated
GQDs under different modifiers.

To further test if the above mechanism is rational and universal,
methanol (MT), ethanol (EtOH), n-butyl alcohol (NBA),
glycerol (GI), ethylene glycol (EG), PEG-400, and PEG-600 were respectively
selected for the fluorescence emission spectrum testing experiments.
As can be seen in Figure 4c, the fluorescence intensity of GQDs modified by these passivators
was found to increase compared to that of the unmodified GQDs, indicating
that the surface of GQDs can be passivated by passivators with a hydroxyl
group. Among all the passivators in this experiment, GQDs passivated
by PEG-200 show a much higher fluorescence intensity than other alcohols,
probably because its long-chain polymer structure can achieve a tighter
coating of the inner layer GQDs, which is in contrast to micromolecules
without a long-chain structure, such as MT, EtOH, NBA, GI, and EG,
and because the hydroxyl values for PEG-400 and PEG-600 are far less
than that of PEG-200.35 PEG-200 is thus
considered to be the best choice for passivating GQDs in this paper.

Sensitivity Detection of Metal Ions
The characterization
of PEG-GQDs promises the feasibility of an application. Here, to develop
a fluorescence quenching method for metal ions sensing, the fluorescence
emission spectra of PEG-GQDs and GQDs homogeneous solutions containing
400 μM various single-metal ions (Cr3+, Ca2+, Al3+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Mn2+, Ag+, Ba2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Hg2+, Fe3+, Mg2+, Ni2+) were scanned with a 376 nm excitation wavelength,
respectively. The (F0 – F)/F0 bar diagram of the PEG-GQDs
and the GQDs with the above ions is shown in Figure 5a, where F and F0 refer to the fluorescence intensities in the presence
and absence of metal ions, respectively. As can be seen in Figure 5a, the fluorescence
of PEG-GQDs is greatly quenched by several paramagnetic transition-metal
ions such as Fe3+, Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Mn2+, among which the quenching
degree of Fe3+ is the highest. Figure 5a also shows that the quenching degree of
the PEG-GQDs by all metal ions screened in the present work is greater
than that of GQDs.

solution. (d) Calibration curves of the degree of fluorescence quenching

in the presence of EDTA, respectively. (h) Stern–Volmer curve
for fluorescence quenching of PEG-GQDs by Fe3+ at different
temperatures.

The fluorescence intensity changes
of the GQDs and the PEG-GQDs
in the solutions with different concentrations of Fe3+ are
displayed in Figure 5b,c, respectively. A continuous decreasing trend with gradual increase
in the concentration of Fe3+ in the solution from 0 to
240 μM for the GQDs and from 0 to 60 μM for the PEG-GQDs
was observed, suggesting that the fluorescence intensity of the GQDs
and the PEG-GQDs is sensitive to Fe3+. The calibration
curves of the degree of fluorescence quenching (F0 – F)/F0 of both GQDs and PEG-GQDs versus the concentration of Fe3+ ions are illustrated in Figure 5d, which displays a good linear relationship
for the GQDs in the concentration range of 40–200 μM
with a correlation coefficient (R2) of
0.97, and a good linear concentration range and R2 value for PEG-GQDs are 24–52 μM and 0.98,
respectively. The limit of detections (LODs) of Fe3+ are
estimated to be 30 μM for GQDs and 15 μM for PEG-GQDs.
The Fe3+ detection limit was defined as LODs = 3σ/m,
where σ is the standard deviation and m is the slope of the
line in the linear response region of the calibration curve. Similarly,
the detection limit of other metal ions are also determined using
the above computing method with the PEG-GQDs system. The linear concentration
range for the detection of Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, and Pb2+ by PEG-GQDs in single-metal
ion solution is 20–52, 40–70, 60–180, 120–190,
and 100–280 μM, respectively, and the corresponding LODs
are 15.73, 23, 59.60, 80.69, and 93.95 μM, respectively (Figure S2b–f, Supporting Information).

Selective Detection of Fe3+ for PEG-GQDs
Iron
is an indispensable element for the normal operation of life.
Hence, it is very crucial to be able to conduct selective and quantitative
detection of Fe3+ ions in a solution mixture with multiple
metal ions. To avoid interference from other ions, the experiment
was carried out by adding EDTA in both PEG-GQDs and GQDs sensing systems
with single metal ions, respectively. EDTA plays the role of a complex
agent to mask the effects of other metal ions. Figure 5e shows that in the presence of 4 mM EDTA,
all metal ions (0.01 M) in our experiment except for Fe3+ have little effect on the fluorescence of both PEG-GQDs and GQDs,
which demonstrates that the sensing systems have high selectivity
for Fe3+.

Quantitative analysis results of Fe3+ in multifarious metal ion solution (Cr3+, Ca2+, Al3+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Mn2+, Ag+, Ba2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Hg2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, 0.01 M) in the presence of 4 mM EDTA for PEG-GQDs and GQDs
are shown in Figure 5f,g, respectively. In the PEG-GQDs system, the linear concentration
range for Fe3+ detection is 8–24 μM, with R2 of 0.99, and the LODs can reach 5.77 μM,
which is even higher than that in the case of Fe3+ alone
and the previous report by Ananthanarayanan et al. (LODs ≈
7.22 μM).36 For the GQDs system,
the linear concentration range is 12–32 μM, with R2 of 0.97, and the LODs can reach 10.78 μM,
which also shows high selectivity and sensitivity like PEG-GQDs.

Fluorescence Quenching Mechanism of PEG-GQDs
To study
whether the above-mentioned fluorescence quenching mechanism of PEG-GQDs
by Fe3+ is dynamic or static, the effect of temperature
on the quenching constant, fluorescence lifetime, and UV–vis
absorption spectra were also studied in the present work. Dynamic
quenching is associated with diffusion, the viscosity of the solution
decreases, and the motion of the molecule accelerates when the temperature
increases, resulting in an increase in diffusion coefficient and thus
an increase in the molecule quenching constant. According to the Stern–Volmer
equation F0/F = 1 + KSVτ0 [C] (where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities
of PEG-GQDs in the absence and presence of Fe3+, respectively, KSV is the quenching constant, τ0 is the lifetime of PEG-GQDs without Fe3+, [C] is the
concentration of Fe3+), KSV increases with temperature if it is dynamic quenching. Besides,
since the collision of fluorescence molecules and quenching agent
only affects the excitation state of fluorescence molecules, the absorption
spectrum of fluorescence molecules will not change, while the lifetime
of the excitation state of fluorescence molecules will change in the
presence of quenching agent.37Figure 5h shows that the
slope KSV rises from 0.009 to 0.027 when
the temperature is elevated from 25 to 40 °C. The weighted average
fluorescence lifetime calculated from the fluorescence decay curves
(Figure S3a, Supporting Information) of
PEG-GQDs and PEG-GQDs-Fe3+ systems is 2.25 and 1.80 ns
(Table 1), respectively.
So, the characteristics of the increase of KSV, the decrease of fluorescence lifetime and the almost invariant
UV–vis absorption spectra of PEG-GQDs (Figure S3b, Supporting Information) can demonstrate that the
mechanism of quenching of PEG-GQDs by Fe3+ is dynamic.

In the case of a dynamic quenching process, the excited-state molecule
of the fluorescent material loses its excitation energy by the mechanism
of energy transfer or charge transfer through the collision with the
quenching agent molecule and returns to the ground state. Hence, this
fluorescence quenching phenomenon may be ascribed to the energy transfer
caused by the collision of the PEG-GQDs and metal ions, during which
the energy of PEG-GQDs is transferred from the conduction band to
the metal ions, leading to a decrease in the fluorescence intensity,38 as shown in Figure 6. In addition, the −OH groups on the
surface of PEG-GQDs are able to coordinate with metal ions forming
metal hydroxides,39,40 which results in aggregation
between PEG-GQDs, giving rise to decrease in fluorescence intensity.
These features of PEG-GQDs could contribute to higher sensitivity
in the detection of metal ions compared with GQDs.

metal ions of PEG-GQDs.

Detection of Fe3+ in Healthy Human Serum
To explore the feasibility of the
PEG-GQDs as a tool for the quantitative
analysis of Fe3+, healthy human serum was used for verification
in this experiment under the above-mentioned optimal conditions. The
average recovery of adding standard sample is close to 100% and the
RSD is less than 5%, as shown in Table 2, indicating the synthesized PEG-GQDs can meet the
requirements of detecting Fe3+ in serum.

Conclusions
In summary, the blue
fluorescent PEG-GQDs were smoothly synthesized
using cane molasses as the source of carbon by the hydrothermal method,
followed by passivation. PEG-GQDs showed more uniform and dispersed
spherical morphology, higher stability, longer fluorescence lifetime,
and higher fluorescence intensity and quantum yield than GQDs. The
PEG-GQDs can selectively detect Fe3+ in a mixture solution
with multiple metal ions in the presence of EDTA, which can be realized
by the detection of Fe3+ in serum. The GQDs passivated
by PEG with high QY can meet the requirements for the multifunctional
applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
Cane
molasses was provided by Ganhua Group
Co., Ltd., Guigang, Guangxi, China. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) including
PEG-200, PEG-400, and PEG-600, methanol (MT), ethanol (EtOH), n-butyl alcohol (NBA), glycerol (GI), and ethylene glycol
(EG) were purchased from Xilong Scientific, Guangdong, China. Analytical
grade EDTA and AgCl, AlCl3, BaCl2, FeCl3, CdCl2, Co(NO3)2, CrCl3,
CuCl2, FeCl3, Hg(NO3)2, MgCl2, MnCl2, Ni(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2, and (CH3COO)2Pb were also purchased from Xilong Chemical, Guangdong, China. All
chemicals in our work were used strictly according to regulations.
All experiments used ultrapure water (UP water). PEG-200 was used
in all experiments except those in which the type of poly(ethylene
glycol) was specified. Blood sample (provided by the inspection department
of Guilin University of Technology Hospital) was centrifuged at high
speed (3500 r/min) for 10 min, and serum was collected for Fe3+ analysis.

Synthesis of GQDs and PEG-GQDs
Typically,
GQDs were
prepared by the hydrothermal method. Cane molasses (1.8 mL) was dissolved
in 28.2 mL of ultrapure water to form a homogeneous aqueous solution
and then ultrasonicated and centrifuged, each for 10 min, respectively.
Twenty milliliters of cane molasses supernatant was then transferred
to a 30 mL steel high-pressure reactor and heated in a hot-air oven
at 190 °C for 24 h. After completion of the hydrothermal process,
the reactor was allowed to cool down, and the obtained carbon slag
residue was separated from the initial product by filtration using
a 0.2 μm filter paper to acquire GQDs primary liquid. GQDs solution
was then obtained by diluting the GQDs primary liquid with UP water
for 50 times. PEG-GQDs solution with high-fluorescence QY for metal
ions detection was produced by diluting the GQDs primary liquid with
PEG-200 for 50 times.

Characterization Methods
Various
physicochemical techniques
were used to determine the surface morphology, chemical component,
and optical properties of the synthesized GQDs and PEG-GQDs. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was executed on a JEM-2100F TEM at 200 kV.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) observation was executed with Ntegra
Prima SPM. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected
using a Thermo Nexus 470FT-IR spectrometer (KBr disk). X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using ESCALAB250Xi. The fluorescence
lifetime of the synthetic samples was collected using an FLS980 fluorometer.
UV–vis absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded by
a UV-3600 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer and a VARIAN
Cary 100 fluorospectrophotometer (the voltage is set to 550 V and
the slit widths of excitation and emission are both set to 5 nm).
Fluorescence quantum yield (QY) was detected using quinine sulfate
as the standard (QY = 54% in 0.1 M H2SO4). The
ζ-potential of GQDs and PEG-GQDs was collected on a Malvern
Zetasizer Nano ZS (ZS 90, UK).

Fluorescence Detection
of Metal Ions
In the experiment
of sensing capability of PEG-GQDs toward metal ions, 100 μL
GQDs primary liquid was mixed with 200 μL of metal ions (Cr3+, Ca2+, Al3+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Mn2+, Ag+, Ba2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Hg2+, Fe3+, Mg2+, Ni2+) solutions (0.01 M), respectively.
Then, the solution was fixed to 5 mL with PEG as the diluent with
vigorous shaking at room temperature. Fluorescence emission spectra
of each mixture solution were collected with an excitation wavelength
at 376 nm to verify the responses of the above ions to the fluorescence
of PEG-GQDs after 10 min. As a reference, the sensing capability of
GQDs toward Fe3+ was also investigated using UP water as
the diluent following the same procedure.

For the masking experiment
phase, the difference from the experiment of sensing capability of
PEG-GQDs and GQDs toward metal ions is the addition of 200 μL
of EDTA (0.1 M) to prove the masking effect before adding different
metal ions. One hundred microliters of healthy human serum was diluted
to 5 mL with PEG after adding 200 μL of EDTA (0.1 M) at room
temperature to quantify the amount of Fe3+ by the standard
addition method, which means that a certain amount of Fe3+ is added to the serum. More detailed experimental procedures can
be seen in the Supporting Information.
