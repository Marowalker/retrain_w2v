Raoult’s law, published in
1887, is taught in chemistry
and chemical engineering fields as a first approximation to the vapor
pressure and activity of solutes and solvents in mixtures. In ideal
solutions, it is exact but many solutions are known to have substantial
deviations from Raoult’s law as conventionally interpreted.
In 1908, Callendar showed that water hydrated to the solute can explain
some of the departures from Raoult’s law in aqueous solution.
Here, we show that by simply assuming equilibria between the free
water in solution and its hydrated forms, Raoult’s law and
Callendar’s extension are valid over the full range of concentrations,
while also showing how water and solutes interact in solution. This
model of solutions has importance in highly concentrated solutions
common in atmosphere aerosols relevant to climate change and air quality,
and in numerous industrial processes.

==== Body
Introduction
Highly concentrated solutions occur in
a wide range of industrial
and natural processes including brines, carbon capture, atmospheric
aerosols, and food drying. These solutions are typically labeled as
exhibiting nonideal behavior because the vapor pressures of the solute
and solvent and their corresponding activities in solution are not
proportional to their mole fraction. Raoult first proposed this linear
mole fraction–vapor pressure relationship in 18875 and Raoult’s law has become a paradigm
in chemistry and chemical engineering. For dilute solutions, this
relation holds but deviations grow as the solution becomes more concentrated.
In 1908, Callendar6 explained some of the
deviations from Raoult’s model by positing that in aqueous
solutions, solute molecules are hydrated such that some of the water
is bound to the solute, so it does not contribute to the vapor pressure.
That is, only the so-called “free water” contributes
to the vapor pressure. This paradigm extended the validity of Raoult’s
law to higher concentrations but it still failed at yet higher concentrations.
In 1973, Stokes and Robinson7 extended
this paradigm further by assuming that for electrolytes there is an
equilibrium between the free and bound water and a power law relationship
between the equilibrium constants. As the concentration of the solution
increases, the water activity decreases and some of the bound water
falls off the solute and becomes free water.

Starting in 2011,
we published a series of papers that used statistical
mechanical techniques to describe solutions over the full range from
the infinitely dilute limit to the pure solute limit.8−10 These models were successful at describing solutions of organics
and electrolytes in water by assuming that one water was bound to
the solute or ion, the next water bound to that water, and so on.
Although a huge step forward, this model has a shortcoming of not
necessarily capturing hydration the way we understand it. From the
prior work of Callendar,6 Stokes and Robinson,7 and many others, we know that multiple waters
can bind to solute molecules. They may also bind to each other in
a secondary layer, but the single stacked water model of Dutcher and
colleagues does not capture what is known from the physics and chemistry
of these solutions. For instance, raffinose is thought to have a hydration
number (the average number of water molecules bound to the solute
molecule in dilute solutions) in excess of 10 but we do not expect
10 waters to be stacked on top of each other to hydrate raffinose.

Results
and Discussion
Here, we apply two assumptions to derive equations
that describe
the “nonideality” of solutions to show that they are
actually ideal and fit Raoult’s law:

Assumption 1: Raoult’s
law applies rigorously. That is,
the ratio of partial pressure to vapor pressure, the activity of all
constituents, ai, be
they pure solute, hydrated solute, or free water, is simply their
mole fraction given by 1  where ni is the number
of moles of constituent i in
solution and nt is the total number of
moles of all of the constituents in solution. These constituents consist
of free water, bare solute, and hydrated solute.

Assumption
2: Each solute may be hydrated and this hydration is
governed by the following equilibria 2.1   2.2   2.3  ... 2.4  where aw is the
activity of water, aijw is the activity of solute i hydrated with j water molecules, and Kijw is the equilibrium constant between the solute hydrated with j water molecules and (j – 1) water
molecules. All activities are given by eq 1. We will now use eqs 1 and 2.1–2.4 to calculate the water associated with each solute.

First, we multiply all of these equilibria in eqs 2.1–2.4 by each other,
so that the activities of the hydrated solutes cancel, except for
the most hydrated solute, giving 3  Multiply both sides by nt and applying eq 1, we obtain the number moles of each hydrated solute
in terms of
the number of moles of free solute, water activity, and the equilibrium
constants 4  where the number of moles of each constituent, nijw, contains one mole of solute i and j moles of water.

By adding
all of these together plus the number of moles of bare
solute, we obtain the total number of moles of solute i in solution 5  where Si is the total number of moles
of solute i per
mole of unhydrated solute i and is only a function
of water activity. Similarly, the total amount of water hydrated to
solute i is given by 6  where Wi is the total
number of moles of water hydrated to solute i per
mole of bare solute i and like Si is only a function of water
activity. Dividing eq 6 by eq 5 gives the hydration
number as a function of water activity 7  That is, Hi(aw) is the total number of water
molecules hydrated to all of the hydrated forms of solute i per total number of moles of solute i. The hydration number defined by Callendar (1908) is the value of Hi at the limit of infinite
dilution, Hi(aw = 1). Marcus11 used
isothermal compressibility to deduce how hydration number depends
on concentration fitting a linear curve through his data.

Equation 7 is the
number of bound water molecules per solute molecule. We also need
to know the number of free waters in solution. Starting with the definition
of water activity from eq 1 8  where ∑iniT is the total number
of all solutes in solution regardless of their hydration state. Remember
that nt is the total number of moles of
free water, free solute, and hydrated solute in solution. Solving eq 8 for the number of moles
of free water gives 9  The term aw/(1
– aw) appears in other derivations
of the thermodynamics of solutions, such as that by Dutcher and co-workers.8−10 Here, we see that it represents the number of moles of free water
per mole of solute.

Now, we have the tools that we need to derive
the relationship
between molality and water activity. The simplest case is an aqueous
solution containing a single solute A that does not
dissociate or associate. Many alcohols and sugars fit this description.
The total amount of water, nwTot, in a
solution containing solute A, its hydrated forms,
and free water is 10  Combining this with eqs 7 and 9 gives 11  Noting that the molality of solute in solution
is given by Mwm = nAT/nwTot, where Mw is the molar mass of water, yields an equation
for the molality as a function of water activity 12  The denominator is the amount of free water
per total solute plus the amount of water bound in hydrates per total
solute. The solute activity is obtained by taking the total number
of constituents in solution 13  Dividing both sides by nt and combining
with eq 5 to obtain 14  which can also be obtained using the Gibbs–Duhem
equation, eq 12, and
noting that WA = awdSA/daw.

The values of the equilibrium
constants, Kiqw, govern
the performance of eqs 12 and 14 via
the functions HA(aw) and SA(aw). For each water hydrated to
each solute, there is a Kiqw so that say for raffinose that has a hydration number of
about 12, at least 12 Kiqw values are needed. For organic solutes, we expect that roughly one
water molecule will hydrogen bond to each of the OH moieties and that
the equilibrium constant will be roughly the same for each hydrogen
bond. As a result, the Kiqw values should be roughly the same until q (the
number of hydrated waters) reaches a value, where all of the bonding
locations are taken, then it should precipitously drop in value to
zero. The logistic function neatly captures this behavior 15  where Kiwx is the equilibrium
constant for each water hydrogen bonded to the
solute, q0 is the number of bound waters
where the value of Kiqw is half Kiwx, and Δq governs how rapidly Kiqw drops to zero as q increases. Since we expect
the value of Kiqw to
drop precipitously to zero when q becomes larger
than the number of hydrogen bonding sites, q0, we set Δq = 0.1, an arbitrary but
small value. We now have only two fit parameters, Kiwx and q0, instead
of the 12 or more equilibrium constants needed for say raffinose. Figure 1 shows the fit for
raffinose. For this and subsequent solutes, osmotic coefficient defined
as φ = −ln(aw)/(Mwm) is displayed on the y-axis because it is a very sensitive indicator of deviations between
activity data and fits to these data. The square root of the solute
mole fraction is displayed on the x-axis to better
show the behavior at low concentration, which is not relevant for
raffinose but is for other more-soluble solutes.

Figure 1 Osmotic coefficient as
a function of solute mole fraction for raffinose
in water. Freezing point depression data from ref (2). Kiwx was fixed at 2, the fit value for q0 is 13.8, and the resulting hydration number is 12.3.

Due to scatter in the raffinose
data, many combinations of Kiwx and q0 fit the data well, so here we
picked Kiwx = 2 and just fit q0.
For glycerol and NaCl, the values were simple fits to the data. The
fits minimized the sum of the squared error in osmotic coefficient
between the model and the data.

Figure 2a shows
the fit for glycerol that is miscible in water, so data exist for
the full range of solute mole fractions. For both raffinose and glycerol,
the hydration number deduced from these fits agrees well with the
values reported in the literature. Figure 2b shows the change in hydration as a function
of water activity for glycerol. The corresponding figure for raffinose
and NaCl is not shown because the change over the water activity range
is extremely small.

Figure 2 (a) Osmotic coefficient as a function of solute mole fraction
for
glycerol in water. Data from triangle,3 diamond.4 Parameter values are Kiwx = 0.553 and q0 = 5.1; the resulting hydration number is 1.0. (b) Predicted
hydration as a function of water activity for glycerol using the same
parameters as in (a).

For two or more solutes in solutions A and B, what kind of mixing rule applies? The total amount of
water in solution is now 16  Dividing both sides by nwTot and rearranging
gives 17  Comparing this to eq 12, we see that the square-bracketed quantities
in the denominator are simply the single-solute molalities; that is,
the numerator in each term is the molality in the solution mixture,
whereas the denominator is the molality in the single-solute solution.
This is the ZSR mixing rule posited independently by Zdanovski12 and Stokes and Robinson,13 which has been shown to be valid for a wide range of solutes
that do not associate in solution. It also shows the role that free
water aw/(1 – aw) and hydrated water HA play. In the work of Dutcher and colleagues,9 free water was assumed to be associated with each solute.
Here, we obtain the same result without assumption.

Electrolytes
can be thought of as multicomponent solutions, wherein
the salt dissociates into its ionic components and each of these ions
comprises a solute in solution. In contrast to mixtures of nonionic
solutes, the ions project their electrostatic fields beyond the vicinity
of the ion altering the thermodynamics of the solution. This effect
was first recognized by Debye and Hückel in 1923.14,15 Pitzer16 evaluated a number of forms
for representing these long range forces and found that it is well
represented by 18  where I is the ionic
strength, Ax = 2.917 at 298 K and ρ
is a fit parameter
related to the ion size and charge. The factor KwDH modifies the
water activity in the equations derived here. Employing the stoichiometry
of the electrolyte, the equations derived above and this Debye–Huckel
term yield an expression for the molality as a function of water activity
for electrolytes 19  where vA and vB are the
number of cations and anions in the electrolyte, respectively, assuming
that the electrolyte is only comprised of one type of cation and one
type of anion. More complex electrolytes are an easy extension. Figure 3 shows the fit for
NaCl to saturation.

Conclusions
In summary, the theory
presented here shows that Raoult’s
original idea, that the activity of solutes in solution is proportional
to the mole fraction, needs no correction if we consider the hydrated
forms of the solute in solution as Callendar suggested and employ
simple equilibria between the hydrated forms.

Most models of
solutes in solution use one of the forms derived
by Pitzer17 because they accurately model
the molality–activity relationship over a wide range of conditions.
For instance, the Clegg and Pitzer formulation is employed by E-AIM,
our popular model of aerosol thermodynamics that performs about 100 000
calculations annually for scientists worldwide working in the fields
of air pollution and climate change. The shortcoming of the Pitzer
family of models is that they do not extrapolate well to concentrations
higher than the available data because they are semiempirical. In
fact, beyond the physical data, they can give unphysical results.
The formulation by Dutcher and co-workers8−10 extrapolates
well at concentrations beyond the available data but does not capture
conceptually how we understand that solutes hydrate in solution. The
model presented here, based on the work published more than 100 years
ago, extrapolates well to concentrations higher than the available
data, represents hydration of the solute realistically, covers both
organic and electrolyte solutes in water, and due to its simplicity
shows the role of free and bound water in solution.
