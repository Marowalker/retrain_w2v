Wetting
of solid surfaces occurs when the intervening air film
between a water droplet and a solid surface ruptures. Although this
rupturing phenomenon is well known, the underlying mechanism has not
yet been well understood. In this work, the rupture of intervening
air films is systematically studied by measuring the spatiotemporal
thickness profiles of the air films between droplets of deionized
water and flat solid surfaces using a synchronized triwavelength reflection
interferometry microscope. It has been shown that the critical rupture
thickness of the air film (hc) depends
on the surface hydrophobicity of solid surfaces. The hc value was increased from 50 nm on a hydrophobic surface
having an equilibrium water contact angle (θw) of
96° to 1.42 μm on a hydrophilic surface having a θw of 25°. In addition, an increase in the critical rupture
thickness with decreasing surface hydrophobicity was found to be applicable
not only to chemically treated quartz surfaces but also to a variety
of natural mineral surfaces. By determining the pressure within the
air films, we have shown that a strong attractive force is present
between water droplets and hydrophilic surfaces, thereby accelerating
the draining of air films. The measured forces might be of electrostatic
origin, and the forces become less attractive with increasing hydrophobicity
of solid surfaces. The present result provides a fundamental insight
into the rupture of air films from the perspective of surface forces.

1 Introduction
The
impact of water droplets on solid surfaces is not only important
from a fundamental perspective,1 but also
relevant to many technological applications, including dust control,2 spray coating,3 and
pesticide control.4,5 On superhydrophobic surfaces,
falling water drops bounce off the surfaces.6 On hydrophilic surfaces, water drops wet the surfaces readily.7 Depending on the nature of the applications,
wetting processes may or may not be beneficial. For dust suppression,
it is desirable to have dust particles wetted by liquid so that they
settle to the ground.

The drop impact phenomena were first studied
by Worthington.8 Since then, numerous research
efforts have been
devoted to tracking the impact dynamics of drops.9 Impact of a liquid drop on a solid surface and/or a free
surface is a complex process,10,11 as it involves splashing,12,13 crown formation,14 spreading,15 and bouncing.16 During
the impact, an air film is formed between the water droplet and the
solid surface. The presence of the intervening air film has significant
effects on the impact dynamics of liquid drops.17−20 The draining of the intervening
air film builds up pressure within the air layer,21 flattening the bottom of the droplet prior to coalescence.
This leads to a delay in the wetting/merging process.10,22 During the later stage of the impact, the intervening air film collapses,23,24 resulting in a spreading of liquid drops on solid surfaces, or a
merging of two free surfaces.

Despite of numerous investigations
into impacts of drops on surfaces,
very few studies were devoted to directly measuring the thickness
profile of the air films during impact.22,25,26 Previous studies have been focused on the instability
of thin liquid films (TLFs).27−30 It has been found that the rupture thicknesses of
TLFs are on the order of 100 nm.31−35 The rupture thickness of the air film was found to
be larger on the order of a few hundreds of nanometers, up to a few
micrometers. The thickness of the air film has been previously measured
using interferometry36,37 and total internal reflection
microscopy.38 Using these techniques, it
has been found that the air film ruptures at a thickness of 200–500
nm when two free silicon oil surfaces are brought closely together.36,39 The authors claimed that at this distance or below, the van der
Waals force becomes dominant and is responsible for the film rupture.
For a water droplet impacting on a microscope glass slide, the critical
rupture thicknesses of the air films are in the range of 250–400
nm.40 Follow-up studies indicate that the
critical rupture thickness remains the same regardless of the hydrophobicity
of solid surfaces and surface tensions of aqueous liquid drops.37 The exact value of the critical rupture thickness
depends on the size of surface irregularities.

The rupture of
the air films might be attributed to several mechanisms.
Intermolecular force may be considered the major driving force for
the film rupture.37 In this case, the film
rupture occurs when the separation distance is within the acting range
of attractive intermolecular forces. There might be two types of forces
acting within the air gap between the two surfaces. The van der Waals
force is monotonically attractive, which might be responsible for
bringing the two surfaces into a contact.36 Another type of attractive force leading to the film rupture might
be an electrostatic interaction between two oppositely charged surfaces.
Other mechanisms/factors might include surface asperity,37 which effectively reduces the actual distance
between the free water surface and the solid surface. However, no
research has been conducted to accurately determine the intermolecular
force between water droplets and solid surfaces across air films.
The mechanism leading to the breakup of the air film is still elusive.

An accurate determination of the spatiotemporal thickness profile
of a fast-evolving air film is a prerequisite to characterize the
dynamics of air film draining and subsequently, to determine the intermolecular
force between two surfaces. This analysis involves a determination
of the order of each interference pattern. The authors of the present
work previously improved the dual-wavelength interferometry technique
by including a third synchronized and high-speed camera that recorded
interference fringes at a third wavelength.41 The synchronized triwavelength reflection interferometry microscopy
(STRIM) technique improves the accuracy of film thickness measurements
to 10 nm or better over the range of 0–4 μm, which is
suitable to investigate highly unstable air films. Coupled with high-speed
cameras, the synchronized triwavelength reflection interferometry
microscope is able to reconstruct the spatiotemporal thickness profiles
of the air films.

In the present work, measurements have been
carried out on polished
solid surfaces of varying hydrophobicity by bringing water droplets
toward flat solid surfaces at an approaching speed of approximately
600–1000 nm/s. During the course of approaching, the spatiotemporal
thickness profiles of the air films are determined from the fast-evolving
interference fringes. The film profile data are then analyzed to determine
the critical rupture thickness and the kinetics of the approach. From
the kinetics data, the interaction force is determined. To further
test the hypothesis that the water–solid interaction is sensitive
to surface hydrophobicity, experiments are carried out on the basal
surfaces of various layered minerals. These mineral surfaces exhibit
varying surface hydrophobicity, and they are all atomically flat.
The force results are discussed in the context of electrostatic forces.

2 Results
2.1 Water Versus Quartz
Figure 1 shows both
a side view (a)
and a bottom view (b) of the interaction between a water droplet and
a flat solid surface in air. The bottom view was shown as a set of
the interference fringes recorded at λ = 460, 527, and 620 nm,
respectively (Figure 1b). In one experiment, a water droplet was brought toward a flat
hydrophobic quartz surface by an external drive at a nominal velocity
of approximately 600 nm/s. When the two surfaces were brought in a
close proximity on the order of 100 nm to a few micrometers, the water
droplet plunged onto the solid surface manifested by a rupture of
the air film. The rupture of the air film was followed by a spreading
of the three-phase contact line. The spreading process occurred within
a few milliseconds or less, and a finite contact angle was formed
as shown from the side-view images (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 Side view (a) and bottom view (b) of the interaction
between water
droplets and hydrophobic quartz surfaces.

The obtained three-wavelength interference fringes were analyzed
to determine the separation distance. Figure 2 shows the spatiotemporal thickness profile
of the air film between a water droplet and a hydrophobic quartz surface
having a water contact angle (θw) of 96°. The
data points in blue, green, and red represent the experimental data
obtained at λ = 460, 527, and 620 nm, respectively. The solid
lines at each spatial profile were obtained using a polynomial fit.
It was found that the fitted curves matched with the experimental
data well. The difference (Δh)/error between
the experimental data and the polynomial fit is shown in Figure 2.
The maximum Δh is 20 nm and the root mean square
(rms) error is 5.93 nm. The profile shows that the water droplet maintained
a spherical shape during the interaction with the solid surfaces,
validating the approach taken to determine the interaction force as
described in the Materials and Experiments section. On the hydrophobic quartz surface of θw = 96°, the critical rupture distance was found to be 45 nm.

Figure 2 Spatiotemporal
thickness profiles of the air film between a drop
of deionized (DI) water and a flat quartz surface having a θw of 96° and the difference (Δh) between the experimental data and the polynomial fit.

Figure 3 compares
the spatiotemporal profiles of the separation distances on quartz
surfaces having different surface hydrophobicities. These quartz substrates
exhibited water contact angles of 96°, 65°, 35°, and
25°, respectively. The lines shown in the profiles are polynomial
fits to the spatial thickness profile data. The t = 0 is when the closest separation distance is 4 μm. As shown,
the critical rupture distance (hc) was
found to be 226 nm on the weakly hydrophobic quartz surface having
a θw of 65°. The hc values were increased to 865 and 1428 nm on quartz surfaces having
θw = 35° and 25°, respectively. Our statistical
study conducted on over 50 substrates shows that the hc values increased with decreasing surface hydrophobicity
of solids, confirming the accuracy of the experimental data reported
in this work (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Effect of surface hydrophobicity on spatiotemporal profiles of
the air films between water droplets and quartz surfaces.

Note that the critical rupture distance was found to be above
2
μm on very hydrophilic surfaces having θw <
20°. At this distance or above, the interference fringes were
barely visible and therefore, a determination of the rupture thickness
became challenging. In this communication, the result obtained on
very hydrophilic surfaces will not be discussed.

Other characteristics
of the spatiotemporal profiles include the
kinetics of approach. The two adjacent spatial profiles were collected
at an interval of 1 s. As shown in Figure 3, the water droplet accelerated toward the
hydrophilic solid surfaces as reflected by a wider gap between two
adjacent spatial profiles obtained on the hydrophilic surfaces than
those obtained on the hydrophobic surfaces. To further quantify the
kinetics of approach, Figure 4 shows the effect of surface hydrophobicity on both the kinetics
of approach (h vs t) and the approaching
velocity (V vs t). The result shows
that the approaching velocity remained constant on hydrophobic surfaces
of θw = 96° during the course of approaching.
The kinetics of approach was decelerated as the two surfaces were
brought closer together. On the hydrophilic surface having θw = 25°, however, the kinetics were accelerated with a
maximum velocity of approximately −3800 nm/s. This result suggests
that the kinetics of approach increases with decreasing surface hydrophobicity
of solids.

Figure 4 Effect of hydrophobicity on the kinetics of film thinning (a) and
approaching velocity (b).

Table 1 summarizes
several characteristics of the rupture of air films, including water
contact angle (θw), critical rupture distance (hc), critical rupture velocity (ΔVc), and critical rupture time (tc). The critical rupture velocity is defined as the difference
between the terminal approaching velocity and the external driving
velocity prior to film rupture, as ΔVc = Vt – dhe/dt. The ΔVc value is influenced dominantly by the interaction force between
the two surfaces. It has been found that the ΔVc was increased by reducing surface hydrophobicity of
the solid surfaces. The negative value obtained on the hydrophobic
surface having θw = 96° might be associated
with repulsive electrostatic forces (Coulombic force), which will
be discussed in detail in the following paragraphs.

Table 1 Characteristics of the Rupture of
Air Films Formed between the Water Droplet and Solid Surfaces
θw (deg)	tc (s)	hc (nm)	ΔVc (nm/s)	
96	7.07	45	–133	
65	6.30	226	58	
50	4.52	679	312	
35	2.99	865	1800	
25	2.36	1428	3200	
The critical rupture time (tc) is defined
as the total time spent from the initial closest separation distance
of 4 μm to the critical rupture distance. As shown, the critical
rupture time decreases with decreasing surface hydrophobicity. The
reduced tc with the decreasing θw might be attributed to two reasons: (1) an increase in critical
rupture thickness, and (2) an accelerated kinetics of approaching.
Evidently, all characteristics signify an increase in attraction forces
between water drops and solids with decreasing surface hydrophobicity.

To better understand the underlying mechanisms involved in faster
thinning kinetics observed on hydrophilic surfaces, the interaction
force was determined using eq 7. In eq 7, μ
= 1.825 × 10–5 kg/m·s at 20 °C, the
radius of curvature (a) was determined by fitting
individual spatial profiles using eq 4, and dhe/dt = −600 nm/s. Figure 5 shows the interaction forces between water drops and solid
surfaces having different water contact angles. The result shows that
the interaction force is attractive with hydrophilic quartz surfaces.
The force becomes less attractive with increasing surface hydrophobicity
of the quartz substrates. On hydrophobic surfaces having θw = 65°, the interaction force becomes almost zero, with
a weak attraction at a distance of below 500 nm. The interaction force
becomes net repulsive on very hydrophobic surfaces (θw = 96°). Evidently, the result on interaction forces between
water droplets and solid surfaces across air films is consistent with
the result for kinetics of approach.

Figure 5 Effect of surface hydrophobicity on the
interaction forces between
water droplets and silica surfaces across air films.

2.2 Water Versus Minerals
To further
test the hypothesis that both the interaction and the rupture thickness
of the air films are relevant to the surface hydrophobicity rather
than surface functional groups, the second part of this work is to
study the interaction forces between water droplets and natural mineral
surfaces. A variety of layered minerals were used as the model surfaces,
including muscovite mica, molybdenite, and talc. These mineral surfaces
exhibit different degrees of surface hydrophobicities. Mica is naturally
hydrophilic, while molybdenite and talc are naturally hydrophobic.
The measurements were conducted on the basal planes of mineral surfaces
which were atomically flat.

Figure 6 shows the spatiotemporal profiles obtained
when water droplets approach three mineral surfaces at a nominal approaching
velocity of 1000 nm/s. As shown, the water droplet steadily approached
a talc surface and plunged onto the surface at a closest separation
distance of 43.5 nm. The critical rupture distance was determined
to be 1767 and 288 nm on mica and molybdenite surfaces, respectively.

Figure 6 Spatiotemporal
profiles of water droplets against layered mineral
surfaces.

Also shown from the spatiotemporal
profiles (Figure 6)
is the kinetics of approach. It has been
shown that the kinetics was faster on mica surfaces than obtained
on molybdenite and talc surfaces. Figure 7 compares the kinetics of approach obtained
on three different mineral surfaces. The external driving velocity
was 1000 nm/s. As shown, the kinetics curve was linear on talc surfaces
with no significant accelerations during the course of approach. On
molybdenite surface, acceleration occurred at a closest separation
distance of below 2000 nm. On mica surface, which is very hydrophilic,
an accelerated approaching was evident at a distance of above 3000
nm.

Figure 7 Thinning kinetics of air films between water droplets and mineral
substrates.

Table 2 summarizes
several characteristics of natural mineral systems, including θw, hc, tc, and ΔVc. The result suggests
that (1) the hc value decreases with increasing
surface hydrophobicity (θw), and (2) the kinetics
of approach increases with decreasing θw. All data
signify that the results obtained with natural mineral surfaces coincide
with that obtained with chemically functionalized quartz surfaces,
indicating that the water–solid interaction is sensitive to
the surface hydrophobicity of solids rather than the surface functional
groups.

of Air Films between Water Droplets and Different Mineral Surfaces

Figure 8 shows the
interaction forces between water droplets and mineral surfaces. The
results were determined from the spatiotemporal profiles shown in Figure 6 using eq 7. As shown, the interaction force was weakly attractive between water droplets
and talc surfaces and became more attractive on less hydrophobic surfaces
such as molybdenite and mica. The interaction force result is in a
good agreement with the surface hydrophobicity data, as the intermolecular
force became more attractive with decreasing the surface hydrophobicity
of mineral surfaces.

of natural
mineral surfaces.

3 Discussion
As presented in the Results section, the
critical rupture thickness of the air film between a water droplet
and a solid surface increases exponentially with decreasing surface
hydrophobicity. This finding was also found to be applicable to natural
mineral surfaces regardless of surface functional groups. For instance,
chemically hydrophobized quartz surfaces expose hydrocarbon when immersed
in water. The basal surface of talc is composed of a silicon–oxygen
tetrahedral, with magnesium–oxygen/hydroxyl octahedral in between.
The basal surface does not contain hydroxyl groups which render the
surface hydrophobic.42 The basal plane
of Molybdenite has sulfur elements exposed on its surface. When immersed
in water, the basal surface of molybdenite exhibits natural hydrophobicity.43 All of these hydrophobic surfaces exhibit a
critical rupture distance of less than 300 nm when in close proximity
to a water droplet.

The increase in the critical rupture thickness
with decreasing
surface hydrophobicity of solid surfaces might be explained using
the thermodynamic principle and the mechanical mechanism. Thermodynamically,
the free energy change (ΔG) associated with
the wetting of solid surfaces by water is given as44 1  where γsl, γs, and γlv are the interfacial tensions between
solid
and water, between solid and air, and between liquid and air, respectively.
Using Young’s equation, it might be modified to 2  where θ is
the water contact angle of
solid surfaces. According to eq 2, the free energy change (ΔG) becomes
more negative when decreasing the surface hydrophobicity of solid
surfaces (i.e., increasing cos θ), indicating that hydrophilic
surfaces can be wetted by water more easily than hydrophobic surfaces.
The free energy change reaches a maximum of −2γlv on hydrophilic surfaces with θw = 0°. This
thermodynamic analysis provides perspectives on the critical rupture
distance.

Mechanically, the wetting of solid surfaces by water
might occur
when the gradient of the interaction force exceeds the spring constant
or effective elastic constant of a water free surface.45,46 For the case of drops, the spring constant is proportional to surface
tension of liquid.47 Prior to the rupture
of an air film, the elastic force balances the interaction force,
maintaining the water droplet spherical. When the attractive force
exceeds a critical value, the air film ruptures followed by spreading
of water on a solid surface. Both Figures 5 and 8 suggest that
the rupture of air films might occur when the gradient of interaction
force exceeds in the range of 9.7 and 20 mN/m for water droplets having
radii of 400–550 μm. For very hydrophobic surfaces (θ
> 80°), we have shown that the rupture of air films occurred
at a closest separation distance of below 100 nm, where the total
force might be slightly attractive or repulsive. At this distance
or below, the bridging of water droplets and solid surfaces might
be attributed to additional factors, for example, surface asperity,
despite of great efforts to minimize surface contaminations during
the surface preparation.

Another characteristic of the water–surface
interaction
is the kinetics of approach. It was found that the kinetics of approach
increases with decreasing surface hydrophobicity of the substrates.
The fast approach kinetics observed on hydrophilic surfaces is attributed
to a strong attractive force. Figures 5 and 8 show the total interaction
force between water droplets and flat solid surfaces that have different
degrees of hydrophobicity. The total force is consisted of surface
force and hydrodynamic force. The viscosity of air is two orders smaller
than that of water (μ = 1.825 × 10–5 kg/m·s
at 20 °C), and therefore, the hydrodynamic force between two
surfaces in air at a low approach speed (i.e., 600–1000 nm/s)
is considerably negligible. In this regard, the measured force is
mainly contributed from surface forces.

The calculated forces
are fitted to an F = c/h function, where c is
a constant and h is the separation distance. Figure 9 shows the fitting
result with c values listed. It was found that the
use of a c/h function fits the force
data well, indicating that the measured surface force between two
surfaces might be an electric force following Coulomb’s law.48 These water droplets might carry opposite charges
from hydrophilic solid surfaces, while the hydrophobic surfaces might
carry similar charges as water droplets.

Figure 9 Fitting of obtained force
curves on quartz plates with the F = c/h function.

Water drops used in this study were formed by passing DI water
from a syringe through a microsized stainless steel needle. Electrical
double layers are formed when DI water flows through a metal needle.
Because the inner surfaces of the stainless steel tubing are negatively
charged, this results in positive charges on the surfaces of water
droplets. The carried charges by the water droplet are achieved because
of the charge separation when a water droplet is released from a stainless-steel
needle to the quartz plate (i.e., an insulator). In this regard, the
water droplet might carry excess hydrated protons on the surfaces
of water droplets in the formation of H9O4+, H3O+, or H5O2+, causing the droplets to carry charges up to 4.5 ×
10–6 C/m2.49,50

Negative
charges on hydrophilic surfaces might be attributed to
the adsorption of water molecules on their surfaces.51 Under ambient conditions, water molecules might adsorb
on solid surfaces to form pitches or islands with a few nanometers
in thickness.52−55 The adsorption of water molecules renders the solid surfaces negatively
charged because of the OH– ion transfer. We have
also shown that the negative charges on solid surfaces decrease with
increasing the hydrophobicity of solids. Hydrophobic surfaces have
difficulty adsorbing water molecules; however, the mechanism for which
the hydrophobic surfaces carrying positive charge is still not clear.

4 Conclusions and Summary
In this work, we have studied
the kinetics of thinning and rupture
of air films formed between liquid droplets of DI water and mineral
surfaces using the newly developed STRIM technique. The spatiotemporal
thickness profiles of the air film during the interaction between
water droplets and flat solid surface were determined with a 10 nm
resolution over a distance of 0–4 μm. The effect of surface
hydrophobicity on the critical rupture thickness of the air film was
studied. By determining the evolution of the pressure within the air
gap, we have determined the interaction force between water droplets
and solid surfaces across an air film for the first time.

The
results showed that water droplets spread on solid surfaces
spontaneously, regardless of the surface hydrophobicity. The critical
rupture thickness of the air films increases exponentially with decreasing
the surface hydrophobicity of solid surfaces. The critical rupture
thickness was found to be above 2 μm on a very hydrophilic quartz
surface having a water contact angle of below 20°.

An acceleration
of approaching was found between water droplets
and hydrophilic solid surfaces. The acceleration in the film thinning
was attributed to the presence of attractive surface forces. These
interactions were strongly attractive on hydrophilic surfaces, and
became less attractive with increased hydrophobicity of the surfaces.
These attractive forces might be electric forces. The charging status
was found to be more relevant to the hydrophobicity of surfaces, indicating
that the charges on solid surfaces might be associated with the adsorption
of water molecules on surfaces. This work provides fundamental insights
into the wetting of solid surfaces by water drops, and the surface
forces revealed between water droplets and solid surfaces across an
air film are new additions to the field of surface forces.

5 Materials and Experiments
5.1 Materials
Polished
fused quartz plates
were used as substrates in this study and were obtained from Technical
Glass Product. The rms roughness of the quartz plates was less than
0.3 nm. Prior to the hydrophobization process, the substrates were
cleaned in a freshly prepared piranha solution (H2SO4/H2O2 = 3:1, by volume) at a temperature
of 80 °C for 15 min. The substrates were then cleaned with amounts
of DI water to remove acid residue on surfaces and dried in an ultrapure
N2 stream. The obtained quartz plates were free of contaminants,
hydrophilic, and could be wetted by water completely. Mineral samples,
including molybdenite, mica, and talc, were obtained from various
sources. These mineral samples were well crystallized. A freshly exposed
surface was prepared on each of the minerals by peeling off the top
layer with an adhesive tape. DI water was supplied by a Barnstead
water purification system (Thermo Fisher). The resistance of the DI
water was above 18.2 MΩ·cm.

Hydrophobic quartz surfaces
were prepared through a methylation process. Methyltrichlorosilane
(95%) and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS, 95%) were used as the chemicals.
In this experiment, cleaned and dried quartz plates were immersed
in a freshly prepared silane-in-toluene solution. The surface hydrophobicity
was controlled by varying the concentrations of chemicals and immersion
times. The hydrophobized quartz plates were taken out of the toluene
solution and were cleaned with chloroform followed by isopropanol
solutions in an ultrasonic cleaner for 0.5 h to remove residual chemicals
on surfaces. The plates were then dried in an ultrapure N2 stream in a fume hood and stored temporarily in a clean glass container.
All chemicals used were of ACS grade. The toluene solution was dehydrated
using 3 Å beaded molecular sieves (Alfa Aesar) before use.

5.2 Experimental Setup
Figure 10 shows a schematic diagram
of the experimental set-up used for studying the interaction between
water droplets and solid surfaces. In this experiment, a water droplet
is brought toward an upper flat solid surface at a constant nominal
velocity. As it approaches, the separation distance between the two
surfaces is determined using the STRIM.41 STRIM records multicolored interference fringes of an air gap between
a hemispherical water droplet and a flat solid surface. The fringe
patterns are then used to determine the spatiotemporal thickness profile
of the air film which reflects the dynamics of water droplets under
the influence of surface and hydrodynamic forces. In addition, a side-view
camera is used to capture the contact angle images as well as the
evolution of the moving contact line. Experiments are conducted under
ambient conditions (70 °F and 30–55% humidity).

Figure 10 Schematic
drawing of an experimental set-up for measuring the spatiotemporal
thickness profile of air films between water droplets and flat solid
surfaces.

In using the STRIM technique,
colored light beams are generated
using three high-power color LEDs. These colored light beams are collimated
and combined using beam combiners. A 20× infinity-corrected long
working distance objective (Mitutoyo) is used. The incident light
beam illuminates and then gets reflected at two adjoining interfaces
of an air layer between the water droplet and the solid surface. The
two reflected beams interfere and form a “Newton rings”
pattern. The fringe pattern exits the microscope and is separated
by dichroic mirrors to the interference patterns of different wavelengths.
Three cameras are synchronized to capture images simultaneously at
a rate of 150 frames per s. Short-pass optical filters are placed
at the front of each camera to create a monochromatic image.

Image processing of the interference fringes is conducted using
a self-programmed MATLAB code based on the principle of interferometry.56 Details can be found in the previous publication.41 The recorded patterns are processed to obtain
spatiotemporal profiles of the air film between water droplets and
solid surfaces. The analysis of fringe images starts with a determination
of the film thickness at the symmetric axis (i.e., r = 0). In this analysis, the orders of the fringes are determined
when the thickness curves obtained at three distinct wavelengths overlap
with each other. By solving for the distance (h)
along the radial coordinates (r), the spatiotemporal
thickness profile of the air film, h(r,t), is obtained. The critical rupture distance
(hc) is defined as the minimum separation
distance prior to the coalescence. The spatiotemporal thickness profile
of the air film is also referred to as the spatiotemporal shape profile
of the water droplet, because the solid surface is nondeformable.

5.3 Experimental Procedure
In each experiment,
a water droplet is placed on a polished fused quartz plate. The water
droplet is created using a gas-tight micro-syringe with a stainless
steel micro-needle. The radii of the water droplets are in the range
of 440–570 μm. To form a hemispherical droplet on the
surface, the quartz surface is rendered hydrophobic by immersing the
substrates in a 10–3 M OTS-in-toluene solution for
1–3 h. The hydrophobized quartz plate is rinsed with chloroform
followed by isopropanol to remove residue chemicals on its surface.
The hydrophobized quartz plate exhibits a water contact angle of above
90°. The quartz plate sits on a customized piezo-controlled z-stage, with a 1.5 in. ID aperture. This configuration
allows light beams to pass through a piezoelectric z-stage and illuminate the air film directly. The piezo stage can
travel at a maximum of 7 μm at a nominal velocity of 0–2
μm/s.

A series of experiments are conducted by bringing
a water droplet toward a flat mineral surface across an air film.
Initially, the mineral surface is lowered manually to a closest separation
distance of 5–10 μm. At this distance or below, the interference
fringe becomes slightly visible. This is followed by bringing the
water droplet toward the upper surface at a nominal velocity of 600–1200
nm/s, while recording three-colored fringes simultaneously. Each experiment
generates three sets of monochromatic fringe images at λ = 460,
527, and 620 nm, respectively. The images are processed to determine
spatiotemporal profiles, which can be used to determine the interaction
forces using the method described in the following paragraphs.

5.4 Force Calculation
The interaction
force between a water droplet and a flat surface across an air film
is determined by solving the pressure distribution in the thin gap
formed between the two surfaces. The pressure gradient within the
gap is governed by the Reynolds lubrication equation57,58 3  where μ is the viscosity of air, h is the
separation distance, r is the
radial position, and t is time. The water droplet
remains spherical during the process as reflected by the experimentally
obtained spatiotemporal profiles, and therefore, the separation distance
can be represented as 4  where h0 is the
closest separation distance, a is the radius of curvature, and s = r/(2ah0)1/2. By substituting eq 4 into eq 3, one obtains 5  

By integrating eq 5, one obtains the pressure distribution along
the radial position under one boundary condition p = p∞ at r = a 6  where dhe/dt is the approaching velocity at the outer region
(r = a). The dhe/dt is equal to the external approaching
velocity.
Therefore, the forces due to the interaction between two surfaces
can be determined by integrating the pressure distribution over the
total area 7  

In eq 7, both h0 and dh0/dt can be determined from the spatiotemporal
profiles obtained
experimentally from interference fringes. The a value
can be determined using eq 4. The force data are presented as a function of the closest
separation distance h0.
