We report an easily
recoverable and reusable versatile magnetic
catalyst (Fe3O4@CS_AgNi, where CS = chitosan)
for organic reduction reactions. The catalytic system is prepared
by dispersing AgNi bimetallic nanoparticles on the magnetite core–shell
(Fe3O4@CS). The as-synthesized catalyst has
been characterized by spectroscopic techniques, such as IR, UV–vis,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and analytical tools,
such as thermogravimetric analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
adsorption, FEG–scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), inductively coupled plasma-atomic
emission spectroscopy, and magnetic measurements. HR-TEM studies indicate
the core–shell structure of Fe3O4@CS
and confirm the presence of AgNi nanoparticles on the surface of Fe3O4@CS spheres. IR spectral and XPS studies lend
evidence for the occurrence of a strong chemical interaction between
the amino groups of CS and AgNi nanoparticles. The nano-catalyst Fe3O4@CS_AgNi rapidly reduces p-nitrophenol
to p-aminophenol using NaBH4 as the reductant
within a few minutes under ambient conditions (as monitored by UV–visible
spectroscopy). The utility of this catalytic system has also been
extended to the reduction of other nitroarenes. A strong interaction
between Fe3O4@CS and AgNi nanoparticles impedes
the leaching of AgNi nanoparticles from the core–shell support,
leading to excellent reusability of the catalyst.

Introduction
Our environment is
greatly endangered by the accumulation of various
toxic pollutants that are incessantly produced through industrialization
and inevitable human needs. Nitroaromatic (NA) compounds are a type
of pollutants for which industrial waste water and agricultural waste
are the major sources.1 NAs can cause severe
health issues, such as carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, mutagenicity,
and residues in animal products. Apart from this, nitrophenols are
listed as the priority pollutants by the United States Environment
Protection Agency (US EPA). Because of these reasons, an immediate
action is required for the treatment of NAs.2 Reduction of NAs into their corresponding amino compounds could
be a productive approach, owing to the widespread applications of
the resultant amino compounds in drug syntheses.

Zerovalent
noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) have gained considerable
attention as catalysts for the reduction of NAs because of their quantum
confinement and high surface area to volume ratio.3 Though all the noble metal NPs (Ru,4 Rh,5 Pd,6 Ag,7 Os,8 Ir,9 Pt,10 and Au11) can catalyze the reduction of NAs, Ag NPs are
of special interest owing to their ease of preparation, low cost,
and better performance. However, the bare Ag NPs are prone to self-agglomeration
and oxidation, which in turn suppress the catalytic ability. These
issues can be rectified by dispersing the freshly prepared Ag NPs
into or onto inorganic supports, such as SiO2, TiO2, SnO2, Al2O3, and CeO2.12

Metal NPs, however, usually
tend to leach out of these inorganic
supports, resulting in poor reusability. To avoid the leaching of
metal NPs, the functionalized catalytic supports are used, which can
hold the metal NPs through genuine chemical interactions.13 Recently, Chen et al. have suggested that the
amino functionalization of the surface of the support greatly minimizes
the agglomeration of metal NPs.14 However,
drastic reaction conditions required for the functionalization of
above-mentioned inorganic supports demand the need for new catalytic
supports that can be functionalized under mild reaction conditions.
Natural polymers, such as egg-shell membrane, cellulose, cotton textile,
chitin, and chitosan (CS), have recently been utilized as catalytic
supports in the field of heterogeneous catalysis because of their
inherent functional groups.15 These low-cost
natural polymers are abundant, non-toxic, eco-friendly, and biodegradable.16 Owing to the reactive amino groups, CS has become
a vibrant catalytic support compared to other natural polymers.17

Combination of natural polymers and Fe3O4 can afford interesting magnetic support for
hassle-free recovery
of catalysts.18 With the design of the
core–shell structure (Fe3O4@polymer),
the surface functionalities of the polymers can be made easily accessible
to the metal NPs.19 In the literature,
for the reduction of NAs, only very few catalysts have been prepared
using CS and Ag NPs, such as CS_Ag,15e CS_multiwalled
carbon nanotubes_Ag,17e and TiO2_CS_Ag NPs.20 As these catalysts do not
contain Fe3O4, they cannot be easily recovered
using an external magnet. To overcome this disadvantage, Ayad et al.
have reported a new Fe3O4-based catalyst (polyaniline_CS_Fe3O4_Ag). This catalyst, however, loses its efficiency
immediately after the third catalytic cycle.21 Subsequently, Xu et al. have reported Fe3O4_CS_Ag NPs, which exhibit both high catalytic efficacy and reusability.
However, the synthetic procedure employed for the preparation of this
catalyst is tedious and involves the use of a lot of chemicals.22 Hence, it is obvious that certain improvements
are still needed to prepare an effective catalytic system that comprises
CS, Fe3O4, and Ag NPs. An additional point to
note is that all the earlier reported catalysts for the p-nitrophenol reduction do not contain a core–shell structure.
It is well known that bimetallic NPs do exhibit better catalytic activity
than monometallic NPs because of the synergistic effect.23 Taking into consideration the above points,
we present in this contribution a facile synthetic route to the Fe3O4@CS core–shell support for the fabrication
of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi composite, which is a bimetallic
catalytic system. This composite has been well characterized before
employing it as a catalyst for the reduction of various NAs. The details
are discussed in this article.

Results and Discussion
The synthesis
of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi has been achieved
in four different steps. In the first step, Fe3O4 is prepared through a solvothermal reaction of iron(III) chloride
hexahydrate with sodium acetate in ethylene glycol. The second step
involves the formation of the Fe3O4@CS core–shell,
in which CS is coated on the surface of Fe3O4. To achieve this, to an acetic acid solution of CS, Fe3O4 is added under sonication. After the required amount
of sonication, CS is allowed to precipitate over Fe3O4 by neutralizing acetic acid with sodium hydroxide under mechanical
stirring. Thus formed, Fe3O4@CS is purified
by repeated washing with water and methanol to remove sodium acetate
and excess sodium hydroxide. The third step deals with the preparation
of AgNi NPs by the reduction of a mixture of the metal salts (silver(I)nitrate
and nickel(II)nitrate hexahydrate) using NaBH4 in ethylene
glycol. In the fourth step, the freshly prepared AgNi NPs are anchored
over the Fe3O4@CS core–shell under sonication
followed by mechanical stirring. These synthetic steps are schematically
illustrated in Scheme 1. Catalytic systems Fe3O4@CS and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi have been characterized using multiple techniques,
as discussed below.

Scheme 1 Facile Synthesis of Fe3O4@CS
and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi
IR spectra of Fe3O4, CS, Fe3O4@CS, and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi
are shown in Figure 1a. The characteristic
peaks of Fe3O4 are not visible in the IR spectra
of Fe3O4@CS and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi
as they are buried inside the typical peaks of CS.24 The distinctive peaks of CS are invariably present in the
IR spectra of Fe3O4@CS and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi. The broad band in the range 3700–3000 cm–1 is attributed to the overlapped −OH and −NH
stretching vibrations. The −CH and asymmetric C–O–C
bridge bands are observed at 2895 and 1040 cm–1,
respectively. The presence of β(1–4) glycoside bridge
of CS is evidenced by its vibrations appearing at 1162 and 894 cm–1. Anchoring AgNi NPs on Fe3O4@CS causes a significant change in the position of the −NH
deformation peak of CS (1563 cm–1). Remarkably,
the intensity of −NH deformation peak decreases and shifts
to 1538 cm–1 because of the interaction of amino
groups of CS with AgNi NPs (Figure 1b).25

Figure 1 (a) IR spectra of Fe3O4, CS, Fe3O4@CS, and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi; (b) IR
spectra of CS, Fe3O4@CS, and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi in the wavenumber region 1800–1300 cm–1; (c) PXRD patterns of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CS, and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi.

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
patterns of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CS, and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi are given in Figure 1c. The strong diffraction
maxima observed at 2θ
= 30.3, 35.6, 43,2, 53.5, 57.1, and 62.8° in the PXRD pattern
of Fe3O4 are because of [220], [311], [400],
[422], [511], and [440] planes, respectively, of the face-centered
cubic Fe3O4 (JCPDS no. 19-629). The PXRD pattern
of Fe3O4@CS exhibits a new weak diffraction
at 21° corresponding to amorphous CS.3a On loading AgNi NPs, the PXRD pattern of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi exhibits new significant peaks at 38.3, 44.3, 64.6, and
77.6° along with the characteristic peaks of Fe3O4 and CS. These new diffraction peaks are indexed to AgNi bimetallic
NPs according to the JCPDS data file (JCPDS no. 01-087-0718).

The UV–visible spectrum of Fe3O4 exhibits
a broad band in the range 500–800 nm because of the d–d
transitions of Fe3+/Fe2+.26 This characteristic band is also present in the electronic
spectra of Fe3O4@CS and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi (see the Supporting Information; Figure S3). In the case of Fe3O4@CS, a new
band is observed around 300 nm because of the n−π* transition
emanating from CS. For Fe3O4@CS_AgNi, another
new band centered at 385 nm is observed. This new band is a characteristic
of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Ag NPs. This SPR peak of Ag
NPs appears to be broader than those observed in normal cases, which,
however, is an attribute of AgNi bimetallic NPs.27

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of
Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CS, and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi are given in Figure 2. The XPS spectrum of Fe3O4 shows two major characteristic peaks at 724.6 and 711.1 eV
because of the spin–orbit split doublet of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively. It is interesting to note
that, after modification with CS, the intensities of these peaks become
weak owing to the confinement of Fe3O4 in the
CS shell. No satellite peak is found at 718.8 eV, supporting the complete
conversion of iron(III) chloride hexahydrate during the preparation
of Fe3O4.28 Although
the O 1s peak of Fe3O4 (530 eV) has disappeared
in the XPS spectrum of Fe3O4@CS, the O 1s peak
of CS (533 eV) is seen because of the formation of the core–shell.
There is no change in the positions of C 1s and N 1s peaks of Fe3O4@CS after the loading of AgNi NPs. However, a
new N 1s peak is found at the lower energy region in the XPS spectrum
of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi because of the interaction
between amino groups of CS and AgNi NPs. The core-level binding energies
that emerged at 367.0 (Ag 3d5/2) and 373.8 eV (Ag 3d3/2) in the XPS spectrum of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi
are in good agreement with the values of Ag metallic NPs. The binding
energy of Ag 3d5/2 in the XPS spectrum of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi appears at the lower region than the expected
value of monometallic Ag NPs (378 eV) because of the synergistic effect
emerging in bimetallic AgNi NPs.23b Binding
energies corresponding to Ag 3p are 573 and 603.7 eV. Ni NPs exhibit
their characteristic peaks at 856 and 861.6 eV corresponding to Ni
2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively.

Fe3O4@CS_AgNi; (b) representative
peaks of Fe 2p, O 1s, C 1s, N 1s, Ag 3d, and Ni 2p.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) traces of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CS, and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi are illustrated in Figure 3. TGA of Fe3O4 exhibits
9% weight loss because of the removal of water molecules and surface
hydroxyl groups (Fe–OH),29 whereas
that of Fe3O4@CS contains two weight losses
in the range 220–320 and 520–620 °C. The first
weight loss is attributed to the dehydration of saccharide rings and
depolymerization of CS, whereas the second weight loss is because
of further decomposition of CS, which leads to carbonaceous residues.30 In the case of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi,
though the first weight loss begins at 220 °C (as in Fe3O4@CS), the second weight loss begins much earlier. This
difference might be because of the coordination of AgNi NPs with the
amino groups of CS, suggesting that 7% of AgNi NPs have been loaded
on Fe3O4@CS.31 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of Fe3O4, CS, Fe3O4@CS, and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi are shown in the Supporting Information (see Figure S4). These isotherms resemble the type IV isotherm with
H3 hysteresis loops that appear at relatively high p/p0, supporting the mesoporous structure
of the prepared materials. Pore diameter and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area values of the samples are given in the Supporting Information (see Table S1). The surface
area is increased after the loading of AgNi NPs on Fe3O4@CS, which may be because of the increase in surface roughness
by the anchoring of AgNi NPs.

30–800 °C.

Magnetic properties of the prepared samples have been studied
at
room temperature by plotting the graph between magnetization (M) and
applied magnetic field (H) (Figure 4). The magnetic saturation point of pure Fe3O4 is observed at 77.9 emu/g with negligible coercivity
and remanence. These data are in accordance with the standard magnetization
value of nanosized Fe3O4.32 This magnetic saturation point of Fe3O4 significantly decreases after the formation of the core–shell
structure with CS, as evidenced by the M–H curve of Fe3O4@CS. The obtained magnetic saturation points
for Fe3O4@CS and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi are 32.09 and 28.97 emu/g, respectively, which can contribute
to the easy dispersion of the samples in the absence of magnetic field
under mechanical agitation and quick separation under the influence
of external magnetic field.32b

and Fe3O4@CS_AgNi

Fe3O4@CS is visualized through the
high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images (see Figure 5b, inset). The thickness of
the CS shell that is coated over Fe3O4 particles
is ∼20 nm. Figure 5c clearly depicts the presence of AgNi NPs on the surface
of Fe3O4@CS, where the size of the bimetallic
NPs is around 20–25 nm. In Figure 5d, the HR-TEM image of magnified AgNi NP
shows the multiply twinned nanostructures oriented in different directions.
The lattice fringes of AgNi NPs are noticed with the d-spacing value of 0.24 nm. This is consistent with the (111) plane
of AgNi bimetallic NPs.33 The EDX spectra
of the samples are given in the Supporting Information file, confirming the presence of expected elements in the studied
samples. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy analysis
exhibits the presence of 90% Ag and 10% Ni in the bimetallic AgNi
NPs.

Though p-nitrophenol
reduction is thermodynamically
favorable in the presence of NaBH4, its kinetic barrier
prompts investigations on metal-based catalysts, such as Ag NPs for
facile and rapid reduction.34 Consequently,
in the present study, we have employed Fe3O4@CS_AgNi as a heterogeneous catalyst for the p-nitrophenol
reduction. As p-nitrophenolate and p-aminophenolate anions show their distinctive absorption peaks at
400 and 300 nm, respectively, in their UV–visible spectrum,
electronic spectroscopy was employed to investigate the reduction
process as a function of time. Prior to the experiment, 2 mg/mL (w/v)
stock solution of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi was prepared
by dispersing Fe3O4@CS_AgNi in deionized water
under sonication. 2 mL p-nitrophenol (0.125 mM) was
taken in a clean quartz cuvette and the spectrum was recorded. To
this, the required volume of catalyst stock solution and 0.1 mL NaBH4 (0.5 M) solution were sequentially added. UV–vis spectra
of the resultant catalytic mixture were recorded at 2 min intervals,
and the obtained spectra are presented in Figure 6.

reduction; (i) bare p-nitrophenol, (ii) p-nitrophenol + Fe3O4@CS_AgNi + NaBH4, and (iii) separation of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi using

solution); (f) the plot of ln(Ct/C0) vs reaction time (t) when different amounts of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi are used.

Figure 6a shows
the color changes that occur during Fe3O4@CS_AgNi
catalyzed p-nitrophenol reduction. The yellow solution
turned colorless within few minutes of the addition of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi and NaBH4. Using different amounts
of the catalyst stock solution (2 mg/mL), the optimal catalyst dose
was identified. The catalytic activity increased with the increase
in the catalyst amount (e.g., from 0.1 to 0.2 mL) of the catalyst
stock solution. However, further increase in the catalyst dose significantly
reduced the efficiency of the catalytic system, probably owing to
the agglomeration of the particles. As seen in Figure 6, the time required for the complete reduction
of p-nitrophenol is 20, 6, 12, and 14 min when 0.1,
0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mL of the catalyst stock solutions are utilized,
respectively. These results suggest that 0.2 mL of the prepared catalyst
stock solution is the optimal catalytic dose. As described earlier
by other researchers, we have considered the pseudo-first-order kinetics
for the p-nitrophenol reduction because excess NaBH4 has been used.16,35 The apparent kinetic
rate constant (kapp) of the reaction is
calculated by plotting the values of ln(Ct/C0) against the reaction
time (t) according to eq 1. A linear fit as shown in Figure 6f confirms pseudo-first-order
kinetics. From the slopes of the linear fits, the rate constants have
been derived as 0.14, 0.56, 0.31, and 0.22 min–1, respectively, for the reactions when 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mL
of the catalyst stock solutions are employed. 1  where C0 is the
initial concentration of p-nitrophenol and Ct is the concentration of p-nitrophenol at time t.

We have
also compared the catalytic efficiency of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi with Fe3O4@CS, Fe3O4@CS_Ni, and Fe3O4@Ag under
identical conditions for the first 10 min of the p-nitrophenol reduction (Figure 7). In all of the experiments, 0.2 mL of the catalyst
stock solution was used because better results were obtained for Fe3O4@CS_AgNi (see above). Fe3O4@CS does not show any effect in p-nitrophenol reduction,
as can be seen from Figure 7a, primarily because of the absence of catalytic metal NPs.
It is obvious from Figure 7b that Fe3O4@Ni is also equally sluggish
in reducing p-nitrophenol. Thus, although it takes
90 min for the complete reduction of p-nitrophenol
by Fe3O4@Ni, the nickel-free Fe3O4@CS does not exhibit any significant result even after 30
min (see the Supporting Information). On
the other hand, Fe3O4@CS_Ag leads to the complete
reduction within 8 min (Figure 7c). A comparison of Figures 6 and 7 reveals that bimetallic
NPs (AgNi) are better catalysts than their monometallic NPs (Ag or
Ni) because of the synergistic effect. According to the results of
UV–vis, XPS, and HR-TEM studies, this synergistic effect is
attributed to the changes occurring in the geometric, electronic,
and morphological properties of Ag NPs during the formation of bimetallic
NPs with Ni.27,23b−23d,33 The calculated values of kapp are 0.02 min–1 (Fe3O4@CS), 0.03 min–1 (Fe3O4@CS_Ni), 0.42 min–1 (Fe3O4@CS_Ag), and 0.56 min–1 (Fe3O4@CS_AgNi). This signifies the effectiveness and importance
of bimetallic NPs, rather than the constituent monometallic NPs, in
the current catalytic system.

In view of the excellent activity
of the present catalytic system,
in the present work, Fe3O4@CS_AgNi has been
employed as the catalyst in the reduction of a range of nitroarene
compounds at room temperature in the presence of NaBH4.
The conversion (%) and selectivity (%) of the accomplished reactions
have been calculated from eqs 2 and 3, respectively. The obtained results
are given in Table 1. 2   3

b calculated using GC–MS results.

Maximum conversion (100%) has
been achieved for most of the nitroarene
substrates employed, except nitrobenzene (77%), o-chloronitrobenzene (70%), m-nitroaniline (65%),
and 2,4-dinitrophenol (90%). Almost 100% selectivity is attained for
all of the cases except for few nitroarenes, which have other reducible
functional groups in their structure along with the nitro group.

The reusability of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi has also
been explored by taking simple nitrobenzene as the substrate (Figure 8). After each catalytic
run, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture simply using
the external magnet and washed with deionized water and methanol for
the repeated times. After drying in the oven, the catalyst was used
in the next catalytic run. Seven successive catalytic runs that have
been carried out show that the present catalyst is persistent in its
action throughout the reusability study. This noteworthy reusability,
hassle-free catalyst recovery, and adequate catalytic efficacy make
Fe3O4@CS_AgNi a competitive catalyst for the
reduction of nitroarene compounds. Interestingly, AgNi NPs have been
found to remain intact on the surface of Fe3O4@CS even after seven catalytic runs (Figure 8b,c), presumably because of the chemical
interaction of AgNi NPs with the amino groups of Fe3O4@CS. This chemical interaction inhibits the leaching of AgNi
NPs from the support and thereby helps the catalytic system to maintain
the catalytic activity even after seven cycles.

The catalytic efficacy
of the present catalyst has been compared
to the activity of similar catalysts, which are already reported in
the literature for p-nitrophenol reduction on the
basis of kapp values (Table 2). Though the present catalyst
is better than monometallic (Ag- or Ni-based) NPs, it is not much
effective compared to the previously reported AgNi NPs-based catalysts.
However, the use of biopolymeric shell (CS) and hassle-free separation
of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi makes the current catalytic
system more advantageous than the rest of the AgNi catalysts. It is
also interesting to note that the reusability of the current catalytic
system is better than the reusability of other biopolymer (such as
cotton and cellulose)-supported Ag NP catalysts.15c,36 Like earlier reports, the electron relay mechanism is proposed for
the reduction of p-nitrophenol, which precedes via
the metal NPs from BH4– to p-nitrophenolate.1b,37

Conclusions
In summary, a core–shell catalytic support (Fe3O4@CS) has been prepared by the facile method using the
biopolymer CS and subsequently utilized to anchor AgNi NPs for the
synthesis of easily retrievable reduction catalyst Fe3O4@CS_AgNi. The inherent amino groups of CS form the significant
chemical interaction with AgNi NPs. Fe3O4@CS_AgNi
has been employed as the efficient catalyst in p-nitrophenol
reduction in the presence of NaBH4 and led to 100% conversion
within 6 min. We have calculated the apparent rate constant (kapp) for the present catalytic system as 0.56
min–1 using UV–vis spectroscopy. Further,
Fe3O4@CS_AgNi has been employed as the catalyst
in the reduction of various nitroarene compounds showing 100% conversion
and 100% selectivity in most of the cases. Through our substrate scope
study, we have come to know that Fe3O4@CS_AgNi
is also effective in catalyzing the reduction of carbonyl groups.
Fe3O4@CS_AgNi demonstrates very good reusability
as it loses only 5% of its catalytic efficiency even after seven consecutive
catalytic runs. The chemical structure and morphology of the catalyst
do not collapse during reusability study. Hassle-free recovery, adequate
catalytic efficiency, and excellent reusability of Fe3O4@CS_AgNi can make a sustainable and promising catalytic system
for the various kinds of organic reduction reactions. Significantly,
the inclusion of CS shell in the core–shell structure is believed
to be attractive in future as its amino groups can be further functionalized
for various applications, and currently, we are working on this area.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Metal salts and solvents were procured from
Merck. Millipore Milli-Q water was used in this present work. All
chemicals and solvents were used as received without further purification.

Synthesis of Fe3O4
Fe3O4 nanospheres were prepared by a solvothermal reaction.
Typically, ferric chloride hexahydrate (1.4 g) and sodium acetate
(3.7 g) were stirred for 1 h in ethylene glycol before transferring
them into a Teflon-lined steel autoclave. This autoclave was kept
at 200 °C for 8 h under autogenic pressure. The as-formed Fe3O4 spheres were magnetically separated using neodymium
(Nd) magnet and washed with distilled water several times before drying
at 110 °C.

Synthesis of Fe3O4@CS
To prepare
Fe3O4@CS core–shell particles, initially
CS (100 mg) was dissolved in 0.53% (w/v) acetic acid solution. After
sonication, to this, Fe3O4 (75 mg) was added
and again sonicated for 1 h. Subsequently, 1.66 M NaOH (8 mL) was
added, and the resultant solution was allowed to stir mechanically
for further 30 min. The formed Fe3O4@CS core–shell
particles were easily separated with Nd magnet and repeatedly washed
with water and methanol. The obtained core–shell particles
were finally dried at 70 °C.

0.1 mmol each of the metal precursor (silver(I)nitrate and nickel(II)nitrate
hexahydrate) was simultaneously charged. After the dissolution of
metal salts, NaBH4 (1 mmol) was added and stirred for 30
min. The obtained NPs were separated using the ultracentrifuge method
(5000 rpm) and washed repeatedly with water and methanol.

Synthesis of
Fe3O4@CS_AgNi Catalyst
100 mg Fe3O4@CS core–shell particles
were taken in 40 mL methanol and sonicated for 15 min. To this, a
freshly prepared methanolic dispersion of AgNi NPs was added and further
sonicated for 15 min. After sonication, this mixture was mechanically
stirred for 1 h. Fe3O4@CS_AgNi catalyst was
magnetically separated using Nd magnet, washed with water and methanol,
and finally dried at 70 °C.

Characterization
IR spectra of the KBr diluted samples
were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum One IR spectrometer in the
range 4000–400 cm–1 with 4 cm–1 resolution. The thermogravimetric analysis of the samples was carried
out in a PerkinElmer Pyris Diamond thermogravimetric analyzer under
a constant flow of N2 gas at the heating ramp of 10 °C
min–1. UV–vis spectra of the samples that
dispersed in water were recorded on Varian Cary UV 100 UV–vis
spectrophotometer. PXRD analysis of the samples was accomplished on
a Philips X’Pert Pro (PANalytical) diffractometer using Cu
Kα radiation (λ = 1.54190 Å). FEG–scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the platinum-coated samples were
collected on a ZEISS Ultra-55 scanning electron microscope. HR-TEM
300 kV of the Tecnai G2-F30 model was used to take the TEM images,
and prior to TEM imaging, samples were dispersed in water and placed
on holey carbon grids. XPS analysis was carried out on a Thermo VG
Scientific Multilab 2000 Photoelectron Spectrometer under an ultra-high
vacuum environment. The Quantum Design PPMS equipped with a VSM setup
was used to perform the magnetization measurements. N2 adsorption–desorption
studies of the mesoporous materials were carried out on a Quantachrome
Autosorb-1C analyzer.

P-Nitrophenol Reduction
Monitored by UV–Vis
Spectroscopy
2 mL aqueous solution of p-nitrophenol
(0.125 mM) was taken in a quartz cuvette along with the required amount
of catalyst and aqueous NaBH4 (0.5 M). The same cuvette
was placed in the UV–vis spectrophotometer, and the absorption
spectra were recorded at 2 min intervals. The progress of the reaction
was monitored by the disappearance and appearance of the characteristic
absorption peaks of p-nitrophenolate and of p-aminophenolate, respectively.

Nitroarene Reduction
For the reduction of nitroarenes,
0.1 mmol substrate was taken in 3 mL acetonitrile-water (5:1) solvent
mixture. To this, 0.25 mL of catalyst stock solution was added followed
by the addition of 0.5 mmol NaBH4. The resultant catalytic
mixture was sonicated for 1 h, and the obtained products were quantitatively
identified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)
analysis under the flow of helium carrier gas.
