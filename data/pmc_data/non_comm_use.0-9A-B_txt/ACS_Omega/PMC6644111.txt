Using molecular simulation
techniques, we investigate the storage
capabilities of H2 gas by the clathrate of hydroquinone
(HQ). Quantum mechanics calculations have been used to assess structure
and interactions at the atomic scale and molecular dynamics to model
the HQ clathrate at successive equilibriums during the processes of
capture and release of H2, as well as the diffusion of
H2 inside the clathrate structure. The thermodynamic conditions
of the simulations performed try to reproduce closely the corresponding
experimental procedures, with results that are in good agreement with
literature observed trends. The results obtained contribute to depict
a more complete and better substantiated image of the mechanisms involved
in stability and in the processes of capture and release of H2 by the HQ clathrate.

1 Introduction
Hydrogen is undoubtedly
an environmentally friendly source of energy
because its oxidation product is water.1,2 Its high availability
and almost zero emissions make H2 one of the most desirable
potential combustibles for the future. Nevertheless, its widespread
use is still hindered by a number of challenging technical issues.
Among them, the tremendous reactivity of H2 with atmospheric
oxygen must be outlined, limiting its implantation. Enhancing the
safe storage, transport, and controlled release of H2 represents
then a crucial step to ensure its feasibility as combustible.3 Nowadays, there are three main methods implemented
to store H2. Gas compression at 300 bar and liquefaction
at 20 K and 700 bar are the best two known ways. The problem with
these strategies is that around 20 and 30–40%of the stored
energy are lost during the condensation processes. In addition, these
methods have an important associated risk because of the high pressures
involved.4 The third method is the storage
inside metal hydride matrices. The main issues involved here are the
rather low mass storage ratio, about 2–5% (m/m), and the high
cost of the metals used, such as La, Ti, Ni, or Pt. A feasible alternative,
that a priori might combine safety and higher storing ratios, is the
use of organic clathrates.5 See, for instance,
the interesting review about hydrogen-storage materials by Schlapbach
and Züttel.6

Clathrates are
nonstoichiometric inclusion compounds, with a solid
crystalline lattice containing voids (cages) where small molecules
can be trapped (enclathrated).7,8 The substance building
up the solid lattice of the clathrate is called the host, and any
substance trapped inside the voids of the lattice is denoted as guest.
Usually, guests are not completely confined inside the cages, therefore
the use of trapped term instead of confined, but have some spaces to move inside the host from one cage to another.
Hosts can be of inorganic or organic nature. The best characterized
family of clathrates is inorganic and corresponds to water. Water
clathrates are commonly termed as hydrates,9 with the CH4 hydrate being abundant in nature, appearing
either along large areas below the seabed or as an important part
of the soil in permafrost regions.10

Among the organic substances able to form clathrates, the benzene-1,4-diol,
commonly known as quinol or hydroquinone (HQ), is particularly interesting.11 From a theoretical perspective, this clathrate
belongs to the category of H-bonded materials, and from a practical
viewpoint, its high availability is a major competitive advantage.
Nevertheless, the main reason supporting ongoing studies of HQ clathrates
is their potential use as selective containers for substances of industrial
or strategic interest. For example, the HQ clathrate could be used
as a solid source of radioactive materials12 or for H2 storage.13−16 The HQ clathrate with C60 as the guest was recently
proposed for H2 enhanced storage.17 Lee et al. have investigated the controlled separation of gas mixtures
using clathrates,18−22 finding a remarkable selectivity of the HQ clathrate for CO2 molecules. This fact suggests the application of HQ clathrates
as CO2 scrubbers23 for decarbonization-related
processes. An extensive characterization, including structural and
spectroscopic properties, phase equilibria, dynamics, occupation rate,
and selectivity of CH4 and CO2 HQ clathrates,
can be found in a dedicated series of works by Torré et al.24−29

The empirical formula for HQ clathrates in a unit cell is
3C6H4(OH)2·θG, where G
is the
guest molecule enclosed in the clathrate structure and θ the
occupancy rate.25 HQ can occur at least
in four known crystalline structures: α-HQ is the stable form
of pure HQ at ambient conditions;30 β-HQ
is the structure of the lattice in clathrates,11,31 formed when HQ crystallizes in the presence of some potential guest;
γ-HQ is metastable, and it is obtained by rapid evaporation
in ether or sublimation;32,33 and finally, the δ-HQ
structure appears in pure HQ at high pressures.34

As β-HQ is the structure of the stabilized
clathrates, in
the following we will concentrate in this structure containing H2 as the guest molecule. More details related with the different
forms of HQ and other guests, specially in the context of molecular
simulation, can be found in a previous paper35 and the references therein. Although β-HQ is the clathrate
structure, α-HQ can also accommodate small guests as H2, in a process called solubilization, with a maximum Nguest/Nhost molecule
ratio of 1:18. The corresponding ratio for β-HQ with full single
cage occupancy is 1:3. Three types of β-HQ have been investigated
so far,11,31,36,37 denoted, respectively, as β-HQ types I, II,
and III. The type of structure depends to some extent on the process
of formation, but it is mainly determined by the dimensions of the
guest molecule, corresponding type I to the smaller
guests, as is the H2 case, and type III to the larger ones.
Symmetry is reduced accordingly from rhombohedral R3̅ in type I to R3 in type
II and P3 in type III. These structures are related
by smooth transformations, and recrystallization is not required to
transit from one type to another. If the guest is exchanged by another
one with different dimensions, the lattice can adapt to the new molecules
changing the type of structure, as discussed previously.35

Classical molecular dynamics (MD) provides
a theoretical framework
for the study of thermophysical and phase equilibria phenomena and
has been widely used in the investigation of some kinds of clathrates.
In particular, there is extensive literature about clathrate hydrates
(also called water clathrates), but this is not the case for HQ clathrates.
For example, Burnham and English38 in a
recent work use MD to benchmark several polarizable and nonpolarizable
water models in the context of sI and sII type clathrate hydrates.
Phase equilibria and stability have been determined using MD for methane39,40 or carbon dioxide41 hydrates. More extensive
revisions of the field can be found in several reviews.42−44 There are many interesting research studies about hydrogen storage
in type II clathrate hydrates using MD.45,46 Adding a promoter
such as tetrahydrofuran was shown to improve the stability and the
storage capacity of hydrates.47−50 Studies about calculations of the intercage hopping
barriers of hydrogen molecules in clathrate hydrates were made using
MD in combination with QM calculations.46,51,52 The first investigations that explored β-HQ
thermodynamics with MD were published by Dang and Pettitt,53,54 followed by Santikary et al.55 These
works considered noble gases enclathrated in a solid lattice of HQ.
MD simulations of H2 as the guest have also been published,
and in particular, it is worth citing the work of Daschbach et al.56 More recently, quantum ab initio calculations
have also been employed not only with small guests as H257 but also with Ne and HF.58

The objective of the present work is to
contribute to the understanding
of the capture, storing, and release processes of H2 in
the β-HQ clathrate at the molecular scale. To this aim, electronic
density functional theory (DFT) calculations, combined with the quantum
theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) framework, have been applied
to determine the paths for guest molecules to diffuse within the HQ
lattice and the overall geometric structure. In addition, DFT will
help us to calculate the charges and equilibrium geometric parameters
of HQ35 and H2 subsequently
used in MD calculations. These MD calculations will be shown to describe
adequately the dynamic processes of capturing and releasing the guest
molecules and their internal diffusion. The simulations will follow
closely the experimental setup whenever possible.

1.1 Nomenclature
Clathrates are characterized
by a crystal lattice with voids containing guests, as pointed out
previously. Therefore, an intuitive way to name them is using the
formula of the guest followed by the @ character and then the host
formula. In this case, we will use H2@HQ and will omit
β in the name of the structure because this is the stable form
of HQ with H2 as the guest at moderate conditions.

The geometry of the crystal voids in clathrates is well defined,
and usually, some (or all) of them are communicated with others in
their vicinity. Therefore, we will use the term void or cage interchangeably to express the space where
the guest molecule gets trapped, and when a series of cages are connected
in the same spatial direction, we will talk of a channel.

The spaces that the guest has to pass through when going
from one
cage to another are, in this case, very well delimited by a ring of
OH groups forming a regular H-bonded hexagon (see Figure 1). Because of its similarity
with a polygon, in addition to the name ring, we
will also refer to it as face or hexagon.

Figure 1 Cross section of the β-HQ initial structure for our simulations,
viewed along the z axis (lattice parameter c, perpendicular to the paper). Atoms are represented as
spheres (C, black; O, red; and H gray) and H-bonds as dashed lines.
Full molecules are included for better clarity. One individual unit
cell is highlighted in the left bottom corner of the structure with
crystal axes. Channels arrange in the z axis direction
and are delimited by the OH hexagons connected by H-bonds. There are
three channels per unit cell, shown with blue circles.

The occupation can be described using several forms:
the stoichiometric
ratio (Nguest/Nhost), mass ratio (w/w), or as we will prefer in the following, the number
of guests by cage, θ. The latter is perhaps the most intuitive
and informative at the molecular scale because of the fact that a
dissociated lattice will not conserve the cage structures but will
have the same number of molecules and, therefore, the same corresponding
mass.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 QM Study
of the Guest Channel
We
carried out a QM study of the β-HQ channels, previous to MD
simulations of release and capture processes. In this part, we calculated
the overall geometry, the topology of the charge density, and the
transition barriers between adjacent cages.

Initial coordinates
for our simulations were taken from the crystallographic data of the
β-HQ clathrate with CO2 as the guest, obtained experimentally
by Torré et al.59 using X-ray diffraction.
This structure pertains to the R3̅ symmetry
group, and its unit cell is characterized by the following parameters: a = b = 16.207 ± 0.006 Å; c = 5.780 ± 0.002 Å. From the initial coordinates,
we built up a convenient structure consisting of only one channel
with four aligned cages. Two independent systems were actually built
up, called, respectively, 1L and 2L. The first one is made of one
layer of HQ molecules (338 atoms), and the second one consists of
two concentric HQ layers (540 atoms). A representation of the 2L system
is shown in Figure 2. The resulting structures were first optimized to obtain the optimal
local geometry, fixing the position of the outer oxygen atoms. This
way, it is possible to retain approximately the shape and volume of
the crystal cells and to allow some degree of flexibility in the structure.
This type of approximation was successfully applied to a system of
two cages in the sI clathrate hydrate for studying the intercage transition
of CH4 and CO2 in a previous work.60 Then, one of the central cages of 1L and 2L
systems was filled with a single H2 molecule, with the
aim to determine the optimal position of the guest. The resulting
optimal geometry of just one occupied cage is illustrated in Figure 3.

Figure 2 Systems 1L and 2L used
in DFT calculations shown along the z axis. C atoms
are represented in black, O in red, and
H atoms in gray. H-bonds are shown as red dashed lines. The O atoms
fixed during geometry optimization are marked with a blue circle.

Figure 3 One cage of the H2@HQ clathrate structure,
made up of
12 HQ molecules and 1 molecule of H2. C atoms are represented
in black, O in red, and H in white. The guest molecule is represented
as bigger white spheres. H-bonds are shown as red dashed lines. (A)
Frontal view, approximately along the axis of the H2 bond
axis, (B) lateral view.

After reoptimization, H2 is placed in the central
part
of the cage and the orientation of the molecule is not parallel to
the channel axis, as it was observed with other similar systems, for
example, CO2 in the water clathrate.61 The H2 center of mass is located at 212 pm from
the OH ring planes and the H–H axis is tilted, oriented toward
one of the O atoms in the ring, with about 47° of deviation from
the channel axis. These results confirm that a non-negligible interaction
between the guest and the host occurs, in addition to the dispersive
one that maintains the guest trapped inside the cage. Orientation
toward the O atom suggests that the cause of the interaction is the
H2 multipole moment, as it was the case for CO2 in water.

With the aim of clarifying how this interaction
affects the transition
of a guest molecule from cage to cage, we studied the topology of
the electronic density in the QTAIM framework and the energy barriers
associated with the transition. The plane of the OH ring face was
examined under the light of QTAIM, and critical points (CPs) and relevant
paths were obtained. Results of our analysis are summarized in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Electronic density contour
plot in the plane of the hexagonal face
formed by the OH groups ring. Side views of the corresponding geometries
are shown on the upper right quadrant of the figure. In the center
of each one is the hexagonal face viewed laterally (red lines). Three
systems are shown: (a) HQ without guest; (b) H2 transiting
across the ring, with one H atom in the same plane of the face; and
(c) H2 transiting, with the BCP of H2 in the
plane of the face.

Electronic density, ρ(x), is represented
in sections along the plane of the OH ring for three systems: (a)
without guest; (b) with an atom of H of the H2 molecule
in the center of the ring; and (c) with the center of mass of H2 in the center of the ring. Conventional molecular models
corresponding to these three situations are also represented in the
upper right quadrant. CPs connected with the atomic nuclei (NCPs)
are represented by bigger orange dots, with O nuclei in the vertex
of the hexagon and H nuclei over the side between two oxygens. Smaller
orange dots correspond to CPs connected with the center of a ring
(RCPs). Blue dots represent the CPs connected with the central point
of a bond (BCPs), the place in the bond path where the electronic
density is a minimum, that is, the weaker part of the bond. Bond paths
are depicted as bold brown lines. Contour lines of ρ(x) are in dark gray and gradient lines in light gray. It
is clear from the figure that the transition of H2 produces
a substantial modification of the electronic density distribution
inside the ring, but the external part remains largely unaffected.
Bond paths appear during the transition connecting O atoms in the
ring with the H2 molecule. These paths, although not straight,
are fully contained in the plane of the ring when an H atom is placed
in the center (Figure 4b). In addition, even the part that corresponds to O atoms remains
in that plane when the center of mass of H2 is placed in
the center of the ring (Figure 4c). From the BCPs present in the figure, these bond paths
continue above and below the plane of the paper toward each H nucleus
in H2. These results confirm the existence of guest–host
interaction and its nature. This interaction is internal to the cages
and affects mainly the guest molecules, which was an expected result
because of the relatively small mass of H2 compared with
the mass of the cage and the small volume compared to the span of
the hexagonal ring.

It is noteworthy that the departure from
a straight line observed
in the radial bond paths happens in the same direction for all oxygen
atoms. It illustrates that the H nucleus of an OH group is not at
the center of the bond path between two oxygens because of the H-bond.
More interestingly, it also implies the coupling between all the OH
groups forming the hexagonal ring, which is expected to enhance the
stability of the structure. The turn orientation can be clockwise
or anti-clockwise, and this fact cannot be determined a priori. Even
both orientations can be interchanged directly by proton-transfer
processes. Therefore, the use of some kind of chirality parameter
in the description of these systems would be of interest. Using the
same level of theory, we calculated the potential energy profiles
for the transition of an H2 molecule from cage to cage,
following the path of minimal electronic density obtained from the
previous QTAIM analysis. This path links the CPs connected with the
center of a cage (CCPs) of adjacent cages, passing through the RCP
of the OH ring in the middle of the cages, and results in an almost
straight line in this case. Calculated values along the path of minimal
density of charge are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Energy profiles, in electronvolt, of H2 passing
through
the hexagonal OH ring in the 1L system, calculated at the PBE/6-31g*
level. X axis is the position, in angstrom, normal
to the plane of the ring. Hollow circles correspond to the H2 molecule oriented perpendicularly to the ring plane, and solid circles
correspond to H2 oriented parallel to the ring plane.

In the 1L system, the barriers
obtained from the potential energy
profiles are of the order of 0.1 eV for the H2 most favorable
orientation (normal to the ring plane) and of 0.12 eV for the less
favorable one (H2 parallel to the ring plane). In the 2L
system, the values are higher, approximately 0.35 eV. The reason for
this discrepancy is that in the 1L system, the fixed external O atoms
restrict the mobility of all HQ molecules, but in the 2L system, because
of the additional external layer, the molecules forming the channel
do not have any atom fixed. This results in a slight contraction of
the channel in the 2L system when compared with that in 1L.

To our knowledge, there is no previous literature in which the
H2 intercage transition was specifically calculated for
H2@HQ systems using QM methods. Nevertheless, if we focus
our attention on the particular subsystem implied in the barriers,
we can put our results into perspective by comparing them with other
theoretical calculations. The hexagonal face consists essentially
of six OH groups linked with H-bonds. These H-bonds, as we have observed
in previous paragraphs, are concerted, providing additional stability
to the structure. The ideal OH hexamer defined in this way can be
directly compared with the equivalent structure happening in the hexagonal
face of a planar water hexamer. The water hexamers are well-known
structures because of their ubiquity. For example, Hjertenæs
et al. have recently studied the planar isolated water hexamer with
the motivation of its application to clathrate hydrates.62 They use a post Hartree–Fock QM approximation:
counterpoise-corrected coupled cluster including up to (perturbative)
triple excitations CCSD(T) method in combination with the correlation
consistent aug-cc-pVTZ basis set, which provides very accurate energy
values. In addition, they benchmark several DFT popular functionals
against their CCSD(T) reference values to assess the relative quality
of them. Their reference value for the transition barrier of H2 passing through the water hexamer is 18 kJ/mol (0.187 eV).
Our values in the 1L system, from 0.1 to 0.12 eV, deviate between
46 and 36% from it, and our values for the 2L system (contracted channel)
rise to about the double. This is a quite reasonable result, provided
that among the other functionals in their study, for example, B3LYP
presents an error in the transition barrier of 33.8%, BLYP-D2 of −22.2%,
or M06-2X of-56.9%.

The planar isolated water hexamer is far
from describing the complete
structure of the channels in clathrates, though. In addition to it,
we can also consider whole cages of clathrate hydrates, where we have
a lattice structure, and about which the literature is abundant. As
a reference, we can take the activation (transition) barrier of 3
± 1 kJ/mol (0.3 eV) at 250 K, obtained experimentally by Okuchi
et al.49 using the pulsed field gradient
NMR technique. There are several computational studies reproducing
this value, within the error margins. For example, Alavi et al.51 calculated H2 cage-to-cage transitions
through hexagonal faces (water hexamers) in rigid structures of sII
clathrate hydrates obtaining transition barriers of 5–6 kcal/mol
(0.22–0.26 eV) using B3LYP and MP2 with 6-311++g(d,p) basis
set. Román-Pérez et al.500 found a diffusion activation energy of 0.2 eV for H2 using
ab initio Van der Waals density functional formalism
in equivalent systems. More recently, Trinh et al.52 obtained barriers of 10 kJ/mol (0.1 eV) with occupation
θ = 1 and 12 kJ/mol (0.12 eV) with occupation θ = 2, using
ab initio MD (BLYP with the local DZPM basis set) at 100 K and values
of 22 kJ/mol (0.23 eV) and 29 kJ/mol (0.3 eV), respectively, at 0
K. Our values agree very well with all of those described for both
1L and 2L systems, although using a lower level of theory because
of the big size of our systems. If we compare H2 with larger
guest molecules, the barriers obtained for CO2 or CH4 in clathrate hydrates60 were 0.59
and 1.16 eV, respectively, around an order of magnitude higher than
the values discussed above.

2.2 MD Study of H2 Release and Capture
For MD simulations, we started from
the molecular model used in
previous works to describe CO2 and CH4 HQ clathrate.35 This model uses OPLS-AA force field standard
parameters but recalculates the equilibrium geometries of the molecules
involved and their point atomic electric charges, as explained in
more detail in Section 4.2. The β-HQ system used in simulations consists of 2
× 2 × 8 crystalline unit cells, containing 12 channels of
8 voids long each, as shown in Figure 1. For modeling the bulk crystal, an infinite lattice
was supposed using periodic boundary conditions (PBCs).

For
simulating the release process with MD, a box was built by enlarging
three times, with empty space, the HQ system box along the X coordinate (i.e., along the channels’ direction).
This way, we are emulating the experimental vacuum applied to the
clathrate samples for releasing guest gases. Our ideal vacuum would
be equivalent to 0 bar in the initial state. The HQ inside the enlarged
box was filled with H2 molecules at a rate of one guest
molecule per cavity. The resultant system was then allowed to evolve
freely to simulate the migration of guests from inside the clathrate
to the void portions of the simulation box at the chosen thermodynamic
conditions, until the system reached the equilibrium. Following the
experimental conditions for releasing, the simulations were performed
at constant mole number, volume, and temperature (NVT or canonical ensemble)63 and within an interval of temperatures from 100 to 400 K. Successive
equilibriums were initially spaced with a step of 10 K, and afterward,
a denser mesh was applied, with a step of 5 K in the interval from
200 to 250 K to better describe the fastest part of the release process.
In Figure 6, three
stages of these simulations are represented, where the progressive
migration of H2 molecules is shown outside the β-HQ
structure. Occupation rate values are represented in Figure 7 along with a fit to a logistic
curve. The fitting serves both as a guide to the eye and as a mean
to calculate the lower limit to occupation. The releasing process
starts at about 170 K and stabilizes near 300 K, with a minimum occupancy
rate of approximately θ = 0.1.

Figure 6 Three stages of the NVT simulations set corresponding
to the H2 release. The simulation box is represented by
a blue rectangle and is viewed along the x axis (lattice
parameter a). The clathrate is placed at the center
of the box, surrounded laterally by empty spaces. From top to bottom:
the starting clathrate structure completely filled at a rate of 1
guest per cage; system at 10 ns of simulation, where some molecules
of gas left the clathrate; and end structure at 500 ns, where only
a small percentage (≈10%) of H2 remains inside the
β-HQ structure.

Figure 7 Guest release process: occupancy rate (θ) vs temperature
(K). Points correspond to NVT simulations, and the
solid line is a sigmoidal fit of them.

The capture process was modeled in a similar manner. In this
case,
it starts with an empty box of the HQ clathrate, in contact with a
reservoir of H2 gas molecules. We chose 96 molecules of
gas to equate the number of crystal voids inside the HQ box. Following
again the corresponding experimental procedure,59 simulations were performed at constant mole number, pressure
(1 bar), and temperature (NPT or isothermal–isobaric
ensemble(63)). The range of temperatures
tested was from 100 to 300 K, and the simulation times were about
50 ns. Figure 8 shows
the results of these simulations. As in the release process, the overall
shape corresponds to a two-state system with a soft transition, reason
why we fitted the data again to a logistic curve, also depicted in Figure 8. Gas capture starts
at about 170 K and ends at approximately 210 K.

Figure 8 Guest capture process:
occupancy rate (θ) as a function of
temperature (K). Points correspond to NPT simulations,
and the solid line is a sigmoidal fit of the points.

In addition to the processes of capture and release,
we have studied
the H–H orientation distribution inside the HQ clathrate channels.
To do so, we perform a 200 ns NVT simulation at 250
K of an HQ box with occupation rate θ = 1. Then we used the
MD trajectories to obtain the orientation histograms of the H–H
bond with respect to the box coordinate axes X, Y, and Z. X and Z axes are coincident with the crystal parameters a and c, respectively, but Y is not coincident with b. Nevertheless, we have
preferred the box Y axis over b because
of the symmetries of the system. a and b directions are equivalent, but Y is in the direction
where the interchannel distance is minimum, whereas the distance available
inside the channel is maximum (compare the b green
arrow with a vertical imaginary Y axis in Figure 1). The results are
illustrated in Figure 9 in three plots corresponding to each axis, where the orientation
distributions were first normalized by the corresponding homogeneous
distribution, and then to total probability that is equal to 1. The
most prominent feature of this representation is the near equivalence
of X and Y in spite of not being
equivalent directions when considering the crystal symmetry. This
implies that the orientations of the H2 bonds are correlated
mainly with the Z axis. In fact, the preferred orientation
of the H2 molecule is along the Z axis:
we observe peaks at 90 in X and Y distributions corresponding to the peaks of 0 and 180 in the Z graph. Additionally, a region of diffuse peaks of around
30–40 of tilt with respect to the main peaks is present in
the three distributions. These secondary peaks are in good agreement
with the calculated orientation using QM optimization as described
previously, with the H2 molecules pointing at the O atoms
in the hydroxyl hexagons dividing the clathrate cages.

Figure 9 Normalized distributions
of the H–H molecule orientations
with respect to X, Y, and Z coordinate axes.

MD allows to study the diffusion of H2 molecules
inside
the HQ clathrate through the determination of the mean square displacement
(MSD). MSD is related with the diffusion coefficient D and can be obtained directly from the analysis of MD trajectories. Figure 10 shows the log–log
plot of MSD with time at 300 K and at low occupancy rate (θ
= 0.125), considering only one guest molecule per clathrate channel.
The graph can be divided into three parts: the first one, below approximately
0.1 ns, corresponds to anomalous diffusion with almost zero slope,
the second, in the central part of the graph, is a smooth transition
between the two main regions, and the third, above 1 ns approximately,
is a region of Fickian diffusion. This is the expected behavior of
a system as the H2@HQ clathrate, where the gas is free
to move at small distances (inside each cage) but is confined at intermediate
distances (the limits of the cage), and some friction appears at larger
distances as a consequence of passing through the hexagonal faces.
Therefore, at distances approaching the cage size, the behavior transits
from an ideal gas regime to a Fickian regime. A very interesting and
comprehensive study of this behavior in type II clathrate hydrate
of H2 has been presented by Cao et al.48 They use a two regime model and obtain D as one of the parameters of the fit. In our case, we selected the
MSD values in the Fick regime to estimate the diffusion coefficient D directly from the slope of a linear fit. A dashed line
in Figure 10 represents
the curve predicted by the fit. The resulting diffusion coefficient
is D = 8.49·10–12 m2 s–1. This value is of the order of magnitude of D values in the article of Cao et al. and directly comparable
with some of the particular cases they studied. At this point, this
result came as no surprise, provided the notable similarities we observed
between hydrate and HQ clathrates of H2.

H2 molecules inside the β-HQ clathrate channels.
The dashed line represents the linear fit from which the diffusion
coefficient was estimated.

Figure 11 Atom index in Table 1.

We have also noticed that the
free evolution of the filled system
at the occupation of θ = 1 led to an internal redistribution
of the guests resulting spontaneously in cages with double occupancy.
This was observed only occasionally, so we considered that the overall
occupancy rate is not affected. Rozsa et al.16 have experimentally obtained double and triple occupation at pressures
above 1.4 and 3 GPa, respectively. In the cited work, they also describe
a nontrivial relation between the pressure of the cages and the number
of occupation. These results are compatible with the observed behavior
and suggest the convenience of future computational studies about
the capacity of the HQ to enclathrate H2 to assess the
theoretical maximum and the dependence with pressure.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, we have studied the storage
ability of H2 by the HQ clathrate by means of molecular
simulation. The particular
objective is to assess the adequacy of the HQ clathrate as the H2 storage medium, as a feasible alternative to other conventional
methods. The results presented provide interesting hints, which need
to be corroborated by further experimental studies, but undoubtedly
evidence a promising alternative. Moreover, the results presented
contribute to the understanding of the involved processes in H-bonded
materials in general. As a previous step to perform MD simulations,
the structure of the HQ clathrate containing H2 was described
within a quantum mechanical (QM) approach, including geometric parameters,
effective point charges, and topological analysis of the electronic
density. The HQ lattice is stable around the crystal voids and, therefore,
around the channels resulting from aligned voids. The structure is
flexible enough to allow the transport of molecules larger than H2 along the channels, as it had been previously shown.35 Transition between different β-HQ structures
is smooth, with the HQ lattice adapting to the guest shape. H2 interacts with the lattice, having its equilibrium position
center of mass displaced from the geometric center of the cage and
being its axis oriented at about 47° from the channel axis, aligned
with one of the O atoms defining the boundary between neighboring
cages. We have also obtained a first estimation of the intercage transition
barriers, about 0.1–0.34 eV depending on the rigidity of the
channel, in good accordance with QM calculations for similar structures
in vacuum and inside clathrate hydrates.

Using MD, we have observed
the diffusion of H2 inside
the HQ lattice and also the occurrence of spontaneous double occupation
per void during our simulations. The diffusion coefficient was estimated
from MD through the guest determination of the MSD. This is a preliminary
estimation, as this coefficient should be temperature- and occupancy-dependent,
so its precise characterization needs further studies, applying the
proposed methodology.

We have obtained the curves for capturing
and releasing processes
of H2 by HQ, trying to reproduce the experimental conditions.
These nonlinear curves resemble and are well fitted to logistic functions.
The interval of temperatures, explored between the pressure ranges
from vacuum to atmospheric pressure, is about 100 K for maximum release
but only 40 K for capture, and there is a minimum occupancy value
of about 0.1, in good agreement with experimental results in the literature.59 The processes of capturing and releasing the
guest H2 molecules are produced then within a narrow temperature
interval, which is well below the temperature of dissociation of the
clathrate structure in this pressure range. This fact underlines the
ability of this material to be potentially used as the H2 storage medium, with the possibility of operation in cycles.

The potential use of the HQ clathrate for the H2 storage
presents several advantages, as the high volumetric capacity, as well
as the mild thermodynamic conditions involved in the processes of
guest capture and release, with pressures near the atmosphere. Bearing
these advantages in mind, our results support the feasibility of the
HQ clathrate as a promising material for H2 storage, representing
an alternative to current strategies. Additionally, the presented
results and conclusions emphasize the convenience of further advancing
the search for optimal candidates among the family of H-bonded materials.

4 Methods
4.1 QM Methods
For
all QM calculations
in this work, we have employed the Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE)
exchange–correlation DFT functional64 in combination with the 6-31g* Pople type basis set.65

We have chosen PBE functional because
of its good behavior in describing structures containing H bonds.66−73 It is a generalized gradient approximation type functional where
the exchange and correlation contributions, in the original version,
are directly included without any fitting parameter but derived from
a Monte Carlo74 calculation. DFT is based
on the theoretical work of Hohenberg and Kohn.75 Their theorems postulate that the electronic energy of
the ground state can be fully described as a function of the electronic
density (p(r⃗)) alone. The
types of calculations performed in this work make use of two common
approximations: independence of time and the Born–Oppenheimer
approximation.76 The latter states that
the movement of electrons can be considered independent of the nuclei,
in virtue of the huge mass differences between them. The level of
theory is limited to common hybrid DFT and a small Pople basis because
of the big size of our systems. As we will see in more detail in Section 2.1, we considered
two systems of 338 and 540 atoms, respectively. Yet nowadays, these
numbers of atoms are huge to be properly treated with more accurate
QM methods.

For the determination of the optimal transition
paths and the study
of the channel structures, the QTAIM framework77 has been used. QTAIM uses a topological analysis of the
total electronic density to describe, for a given molecule, the particular
role of its component atoms. In particular, the whole electronic density
of the molecule can be obtained by the juxtaposition (not linear combination)
of the corresponding atomic regions or basins. QTAIM rigorously describes
characteristic points of the molecule, called NCP, BCP, RCP, and CCP,
and also the paths connecting them, as, for instance, the bond lines,
or as in our case, the transition paths between points of minimum
energy. In QTAIM analysis, signature of the second derivatives (Hessian)
of the electronic density is used to identify the type of CP. Electronic
density, ρ, is a function of just the three space coordinates,
ρ(x,y,z),
and this fact permits to identify easily the CP types. Thus, if the
point is a local maximum in all three (intrinsic) coordinates, it
will be a NCP, if it is a maximum in two of them and a minimum in
the other one, it will be a BCP, a minimum in two and a maximum in
the other one, a RCP, and finally, a minimum in the three dimensions
will correspond to a CCP.

QM calculations of the electronic
structure were made using Gaussian
09 computational chemistry suite.78 QTAIM
calculations were performed with Multiwfn79 tool, starting from wave functions previously calculated using Gaussian
09 at the level of theory described above. For the representation
of molecules, we used VMD80,81 with the tachyon82 ray tracing system.

4.2 MD Methods
Release and capture of
H2 by HQ are dynamic processes where we can neglect overall
effects of bond reordering or charge transfer, and therefore, they
can be effectively modeled using MD. This technique is actually semiclassical,
that is, it does not solve quantum equations but uses quantum foundations
to set the effective interaction parameters. Cendagorta et al.83 reported that below 50 K, quantum effects are
significant in H2 hydrates, and at even lower temperatures,
namely 25 K, quantum energy barriers for the diffusion of H2 between adjacent cages overcome the classical ones. In our calculations,
the range of temperatures for the release and capture starts at around
150 K, much higher than 50 K, and therefore, we consider that the
classical treatment is appropriate here.

The force field used
in this work for MD calculations is based in OPLS-AA84,85 force field, where the only difference is that geometric equilibrium
parameters and partial charges were obtained for our particular structures
using QM calculations. The partial charges of each atom were recalculated
using charges from electrostatic potentials using a grid-based method
scheme.86 The parameters for the HQ molecule
have been described in detail in a previous work35 where the model was tested. The geometry and intramolecular
force parameters were obtained automatically with the MKTOP utility87 and subsequently checked. Force field atom type,
charges, and masses used are shown in Table 1. The H2 model used here is rigid. It consists of two
centers of mass located at the H nucleus positions and three centers
of charge, calculated using the cited scheme, two of them of 0.4932e in the same positions than the masses, and the third one
of −0.9864e in the center of the molecule
at 74.14 pm of each nucleus. This way, the mass and total charge are
the same as the neutral H2 molecule and, at the same time,
the quadrupole moment of the molecule is also described.

a OPLS-AA atom type,
charge, and mass
considered for each atom in the molecule topology are listed.

The standard values of charge in
the original OPLS-AA force field
are acceptable for macromolecules and, for these cases, the computational
cost for recalculating them at the quantum level would be very high.
The opposite is true for small molecules as HQ or H2: the
corresponding computational cost is very affordable, and the recalculated
values improve the original molecular model significantly.

Simulations
were performed either in the NVT (or
canonical) ensemble, with fixed mole number, constant volume, and
temperature, or in the NPT (or isothermal–isobaric)
ensemble, with constant mole number, pressure, and temperature. Temperature
was fixed with the thermostat introduced by Bussi et al.88 based in velocity rescaling. For the NPT simulations, pressure was kept constant by the Parrinello–Rahman
barostat.89,90 The gas–clathrate interfaces in our
simulation box are orthogonal to the x axis, being
the response to changes in pressure different in x direction than in y and z. To
take this fact into account, we chose the semi-isotropic pressure
coupling scheme, with double coupling constant in x than in y, z directions. The maximum
time step in all calculations was 2 fs. As usual, the periodicity
of the crystal bulk was modeled using PBCs and the minimum image convention.
Cutoff values for Coulombic and Lennard-Jones intermolecular interactions
were set to 1.1 nm, limited by the simulation box. Coulombic and Lennard-Jones
interactions were evaluated using the four-order particle mesh Ewald91,92 method. To describe crossed interactions, we used the geometric
mean of Good and Hope93 for equilibrium
distances in the Lorentz–Berthelot scheme of combining rules.

All MD simulations have been carried out using GROMACS 5.1.4 software.94−101 Occupation rate values, shown in Figures 7 and 8, were obtained
directly from the MD trajectory files. As there is no available standard
tool in GROMACS for counting occupied sites, we coded an ad hoc tool
in Python 3.6.4 using the module MDAnalysis.102,103
