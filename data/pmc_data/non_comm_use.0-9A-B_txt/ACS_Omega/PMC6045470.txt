Polybrominated diphenyl
ethers (PBDEs) are “emerged” contaminants that were
produced
and used as flame retardants in numerous consumer and industrial applications
for decades until banned. They remain ubiquitously present in the
environment today. Here, a unique set of >200 biotic samples from
the Antarctic was analyzed for PBDEs, including phytoplankton, krill,
fish, and fur seal milk, spanning several sampling seasons over 14
years. PBDE-47 and -99 were the dominant congeners determined in all
samples, constituting >60% of total PBDEs. A temporal trend was
observed
for ∑7PBDE concentrations in fur seal milk, where
concentrations significantly increased (R2 = 0.57, p < 0.05) over time (2000–2014).
Results for krill and phytoplankton also suggested increasing PBDE
concentrations over time. Trends of PBDEs in fur seal milk of individual
seals sampled 1 or more years apart showed no clear temporal trends.
Overall, there was no indication of PBDEs decreasing in Antarctic
biota yet, whereas numerous studies have reported decreasing trends
in the northern hemisphere. Similar PBDE concentrations in perinatal
versus nonperinatal milk implied the importance of local PBDE sources
for bioaccumulation. These results indicate the need for continued
assessment of contaminant trends, such as PBDEs, and their replacements,
in Antarctica.

==== Body
Introduction
Antarctica is one of
the most pristine places on the planet. However,
even in this remote region, anthropogenic effects are measurable.
Scientific exploration in Antarctica has occurred for decades and
in the summer season, the continent hosts over 100 active facilities
operated by 30 different nations.1 Although
pollution in Antarctica has typically been orders of magnitude lower
than concentrations reported elsewhere around the globe, organic contaminants,
particularly (semi-) volatile ones, have reached the region via long-range
environmental transport by processes of global fractionation and cold
condensation.2 Legacy contaminants, such
as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides
(OCPs), have been reported along with more recent contaminants, such
as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluoroalkyl substances,
in numerous environmental matrices from the region.3−9 Some of this contamination has also been found to originate from
research stations themselves.10,11

Polybrominated
diphenyl ethers are “emerged” contaminants
that have been used as additive flame retardants for decades in a
wide range of consumer and industrial applications (e.g., upholstery,
electronics) and are easily leached from these manufactured goods
into the environment, food webs, and ultimately reaching humans.12 PBDEs, like many legacy persistent organic pollutants
(POPs) (e.g., PCBs), are hydrophobic and lipophilic. The height of
PBDE production was dominated by three different commercial mixtures
(penta-, octa-, and deca-BDE).13 In 2009,
penta- and octa-PBDE mixtures were listed by the Stockholm Convention.13 However, production of the deca-BDE has persisted
in many countries and a massive reserve of products that contain PBDEs
exist around the globe and will continue to leach them into the environment.5,14−16

Several studies have reported PBDE concentrations
starting to decrease
over the last 5–10 years. For example, time trends of PBDEs
in samples collected from Swedish mothers indicate a decreasing trend
for most PBDEs, except for BDEs 153 and 209, from 1996 to 2010.17 PBDEs also decreased in Baltic herring over
the last decade.18 Across the Great Lakes
in North America, PBDEs in fish started to decline in 1999–2000.19 So far, no consistent set of Antarctic samples
has been available to document time trends of PBDEs in Antarctic marine
biota, although several previous studies have detected PBDEs in the
Antarctic environment.3,4,9,10,20

Kelly
et al. in 2008 presented evidence from a Canadian Arctic
marine food web in which many PBDEs appeared to exhibit negligible
biomagnification, with the exception of BDE-47, which did demonstrate
food web biomagnification, albeit at a much lower level than PCBs.21 Yet in the same study, PBDEs in macroalgae were
excluded from the trophic magnification factor calculation as their
concentrations exceeded those from other trophic levels by 5–10
times.

We obtained a unique set of biotic samples from West
Antarctica
(Figure 1), including
phytoplankton, krill, fish, and fur seal milk, spanning several years
(2000–2014). A previous paper reported generally declining
trends of several but not all PCBs and legacy OCPs in these fur seal
milk samples; PBDE concentrations were not measured at the time.6 We used these samples to assess the presence
and trophic transfer of PBDEs in the West Antarctic food web and to
identify the PBDE temporal trends in this region either from yearly
averages or in the case of repeatedly sampled fur seals, from individual
trends over time. The food web structure was assessed using stable
isotopes of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N).

Specific goals in this research
were to (i) determine which PBDEs
are being detected in different Antarctic biota; (ii) establish temporal
trends of common PBDE congeners over a time period where global regulations
and restrictions on production had been implemented (i.e., 2000s);
(iii) contrast trends of PBDEs in Antarctic fur seal milk to those
from the Arctic; and (iv) assess the difference of milk sampled before
and after fur seals begin foraging locally in waters off the Antarctic
Peninsula.

Materials and Methods
Sample Collection
Milk samples were
collected from
Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) approximately 100 km off the Antarctic Peninsula at Cape Shirreff,
Livingston Island (62.47°S, 60.77°′W) over the austral
summers of 2000/2001, 2001/2002, 2004/2005, 2009/2010, 2010/2011,
2011/2012, 2012/2013, and 2013/2014 (Figure 1 and Tables S1–S8). Most seals were multiparous females in their perinatal stage (i.e.,
the seals had all bred prior to the year of sample collection and
milk was collected during the perinatal period, 1–2 days postpartum,
prior to initiation of offshore foraging trips), except for the 2011/2012,
2012/2013, and 2013/2014 samples, which consisted of both perinatal
and nonperinatal (i.e., after initiation of foraging cycles) milk
samples (Tables S6–S8). Seals were
assumed to have had at least one pup prior to the breeding season
sampled as all seals were age 5 or older, with the majority being
over the age of 7. Seal capture was performed following methods described
in Polito and Goebel and as reported in Brault et al.6,22 In brief, seals were captured with hoop nets, sedated with 5 mg
of midazolam, and anesthetized with isoflurane. Milk was collected
after an intramuscular injection of oxytocin (0.25 mL, 10 UI/mL) in
precleaned vials and stored at −20 °C until analysis.6,22 Temperature loggers sampling every 10 min were kept with samples
to confirm storage temperature.

Phytoplankton samples were collected
in a region of Antarctica that spans from the West Antarctic Peninsula
to the Ross Sea (64.78°S, 64.07°W to 78.64°S, 164.30°W, Figure 1) over the austral
summers of 2007/2008, 2009/2010, and 2010/2011 using ring net tows
(Table S9). Phytoplankton samples consisted
largely of diatoms (Antarctic Peninsula) and Phaeocystis sp. (Amundsen and Ross Seas). Further specifics on sample collection
can be referenced in Brault et al.6,23

All
krill and fish samples were collected from within the Palmer
Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) grid survey region (approx. 66.99°S,
69.28°W to 61.94°S, 73.78°W, Figure 1) via 700 μm ring net tows (taken at
oblique angles, Table S10). Krill samples
consisted predominantly of Euphausia superba and were collected during the austral summers of 2007/2008 and 2010/2011
and split into three size classes (juveniles, adults (including mature
females), and gravid females). Fish samples consisted of either silverfish
(Pleuragramma antarcticum) or myctophids
(Electrona antarctica) and were collected
in the same manner as krill (Table S11).

Sample Extraction
Fur seal milk extraction was conducted
in two batches. The first batch (n = 59), which consists
of samples from the five austral summers spanning from 2000/2001 to
2010/2011, was extracted at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science
(VIMS) following previously established POP procedures as reported
in Geisz et al.24 In short, fur seal milk
was freeze-dried, homogenized, subsampled (1 g of dry weight), solvent-extracted
(65:35 dichloromethane/acetone), and analyzed for several POPs (e.g.,
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT),
PCBs, and chlordane) as well as lipid content.6 Sample extracts were shipped to the University of Rhode Island’s
Graduate School of Oceanography (URI-GSO) for PBDE analysis.

The second batch of fur seal milk samples (samples from 2011/2012,
2012/2013, and 2013/2014, n = 71) was extracted at
URI-GSO, as detailed in the Supporting information (SI). Briefly, 2 mL of fur seal milk was spiked with PBDE surrogates,
extracted three times with 20 mL each of n-hexane/acetone
(2:1), treated with concentrated sulfuric acid to denature lipids,
and cleaned on solid-phase extraction cartridges. Percent lipid was
measured separately.

Phytoplankton, fish, and krill samples
were also extracted at VIMS.
Samples were manually homogenized with a Virtis “45”
tissue homogenizer (Virtis Co. Inc.), freeze-dried at −80 °C
for approximately 72 h, and solvent-extracted. Further details on
sample preparation can be gathered from Brault.23 Following analysis at VIMS for several legacy POPs,6 phytoplankton, fish, and krill, sample extracts
were shipped to URI-GSO to be analyzed for PBDEs.

PBDE Analysis
All samples were analyzed for mono- through
hepta-brominated congeners (BDE-2, -8, -15, -30, -28, -49, -47, -100,
-99, -154, -153, and -183) via gas chromatography (GC) tandem mass
spectrometry (MS) on an Agilent 6890N GC coupled to a Waters Quattro
Micro MS/MS under electron ionization/MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring
mode using a DB-5MS column (Agilent J&W GC Columns, 122-5532,
length 30 m, i.d. 0.250 mm, film 0.25 μm) and splitless injection
(for more details, see SI). Analysis of
BDE-209 was conducted separately, and procedures are detailed in the SI.

Sample extracts were spiked with 10
μL of a 5 ng/μL 13C12-labeled PBDE
surrogate (13C12 BDEs-28, 47, 99, 153, and 183,
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) for a total concentration of 50 ng
and 5.0 μL of a 5.0 ng/μL injection standard (p-terphenyl-d14, AccuStandard)
for a total concentration of 25 ng. To the samples originally extracted
at VIMS, the surrogate was added postextraction. These samples were
corrected for the average recoveries of previously analyzed POPs (e.g.,
DDT, PCBs, and chlordane), which were 79 ± 3.7% for phytoplankton,
69 ± 1.8% for krill, and 78 ± 1.8% for fur seal milk. The
second batch of fur seal milk samples (2011/2012, 2012/2013, and 2013/2014)
was spiked prior to extraction at URI-GSO directly with 20 μL
of a 2.0 ng/μL PBDE surrogate standard in nonane. Results presented
below are only for compounds that were detected >30% of the time.

Quality Control
Laboratory blanks of a hydromatrix
material were initially extracted alongside real samples, and any
blanks included in the vial files for shipment from VIMS to URI-GSO
were analyzed for PBDEs. All samples were blank-corrected; main detected
congeners were BDE-47 and -99 with concentrations averaging 0.18 ±
0.20 ng (standard deviation (SD)) and 0.18 ± 0.23 ng, respectively
(Table S12, SI). For BDE-209, amounts in
blanks were similar to fur seal milk results, so results are not reported
here.

At URI-GSO, laboratory blanks, matrix spikes (n = 8), blank spikes (n = 4), and duplicates
of fur seal milk (n = 10) were included. Limit of
detection (LOD) was calculated as the average detected blank concentrations
+ 3 times the standard deviation (Table S13). For congeners that were not detected, the noise was used to derive
LODs (Table S14); LODs ranged from 0.011
ng/g lipid (BDE-2, 15) to 0.16 ng/g lipid (BDE-99). Recoveries of
the surrogate standards ranged from 83 ± 2.4% (BDE-183) to 94
± 3.1% (BDE-47). Recoveries of the congeners in the matrix and
blank spikes generally ranged from 92% (BDE-2) to 102% (BDE-47), as
shown in Table S15. Relative percent difference
for the duplicates ranged from 6.2% (BDE-100) to 21% (BDE-2).

δ13C and δ15N Analysis
δ13C and δ15N stable isotopes for
the majority of samples were determined via an elemental analyzer
isotopic ratio mass spectrometer at VIMS, as described elsewhere (Figure S1).6 Some
plankton samples were analyzed at the University of California, Santa
Cruz (UCSC) on a Carlo Erba EA 1108 elemental analyzer coupled to
a Finnegan Delta-Plus isotopic ratio mass spectrometer. Average values
were −29 ± 0.40‰ for δ13C and
1.6 ± 0.50‰ for δ15N.

Statistical
Analysis
Data were tested for normality
using the Shapiro–Wilks test in RStudio, IBM SPSS Statistics
22, and SigmaPlot 12 software packages. Concentrations were natural
log transformed to make data have a normal or near-normal distribution.
Linear regressions were performed for each congener with >30% detection
against fur seal age, breeding season, δ13C, and
δ15N. Any difference between PBDE concentrations
in perinatal and nonperinatal milk was tested using a student’s
two-sample t test assuming unequal variances. A student’s t test was used to compare between detected PBDE concentrations
in the krill samples of 2007 and 2011. Similarly, the one-way repeated
analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to compare between detected
PBDE concentrations in (i) the different krill samples (juveniles,
adults, and gravid); (ii) phytoplankton samples collected in 2007–2011;
and (iii) between the calculated trophic levels for the different
seal samples collected in 2000, 2001, 2004, 2009, and 2010.

Results
and Discussion
PBDE-47 and -99 were the dominant congeners
determined in all samples,
generally constituting >60% of total PBDEs. Phytoplankton samples
displayed the highest overall concentrations, followed by fur seal
milk, krill, and lastly fish, in which no PBDEs were detected (Table 1). The lower brominated
congeners (BDE-2, -8, -15, and -30) and BDE-183 were not regularly
detected until 2011/2012. These trends could, at least partially,
be explained by the switch in extraction procedures between VIMS (2000/2001–2010/2011)
and URI-GSO. To ensure consistency across the various samples, we
focus on the seven most routinely detected congeners (BDE-28, -49,
-47, -100, -99, -154, and -153), which were also summed (∑7BDEs).

Fur Seal Milk
Lipids in fur seal
milk were high with
an average value of 64 ± 9% (SD; range 14–84%). PBDEs
were detected in all fur seal milk samples (n = 130; Tables S15–S22). The ∑7PBDEs in all fur seal milk samples ranged from 0.14 to 17 ng/g lipid
with a mean ± SD of 2.1 ± 1.9 ng/g lipid (median of 1.7
ng/g lipid). BDE-47 was the most dominant congener with a range of
0.14–12 ng/g lipid and a mean of 1.3 ± 1.4 ng/g lipid
(median of 0.95 ng/g lipid). BDE-99 was the second most dominant congener
but showed less variability with a range from <LOD to 2.7 ng/g
lipid, mean of 0.36 ± 0.36 ng/g lipid (median of 0.27 ng/g lipid).
Similar PBDE concentrations of around 1.5–2.0 ng/g lipid (Table 1) have been reported
for Antarctic Weddell seal blubber.28,29 For comparison,
ringed seal blubber in the Canadian Arctic contained more elevated
∑15PBDEs at 11–14 ng/g lipid.30

Stable isotope analysis was only available
for fur seal milk collected during the first five austral summers
(2000/2001–2010/2011, n = 59). Both δ13C and δ15N demonstrated variability: δ13C ranged from −26 to −20‰ with a mean
± SD of −23 ± 1.4‰; δ15N
ranged from 8.0 to 14‰, with a mean ± SD of 10 ±
1.2‰.

Fur Seal Milk Trends
In fur seal
milk, the dominant
congeners BDE-47 and -99 showed no significant correlation with age,
similar to results for legacy POPs, implying that older animals did
not display greater concentrations.6 No
significant relationships were found between fur seal milk PBDE concentration
and δ13C value from regression analysis. Few significant
trends were observed between PBDE concentration and δ15N value; most notably in 2000/2001, BDE-47 and ∑7PBDEs versus δ15N both demonstrate significantly
negative trends (i.e., decreasing concentration with increasing δ15N value or trophic level). We have no explanation for this
trend, but note that it disappears when looking at all fur seal milk
results from 2000/2001 to 2010/2011 combined.

∑7PBDE concentrations for the 2011/2012 breeding season were significantly
greater than for the other breeding seasons, except for 2009/2010
and 2013/2014 (one-way repeated ANOVA, p < 0.001).
Additionally, a temporal trend was observed for ∑7PBDE concentrations (Figure 2), where concentrations significantly increased (R2 = 0.57, p = 0.03) over time (from 2000
to 2014). We note that the (increasing) slope of PBDE concentrations
over time was not significantly different when considering either
all 8 sampling years or just the first 5 years (those extracted at
the VIMS).

austral summers sampled. Bars represent standard deviation. The first
five austral summers (2000/2001–2010/2011) have had a recovery
correction of 77.86% applied. (b) Average percent composition of PBDEs
in fur seal milk from 2000/2001 to 2013/2014.

Fur Seal Milk Trends in the Same Individuals
The previous
discussion was based on average values from randomly sampled female
fur seals over time. Milk samples from 18 of these individuals were
collected twice with at least 1 year between sampling times. From
11 seals, only perinatal milk was obtained, from 3 seals only nonperinatal
milk was obtained, and from four seals both perinatal and nonperinatal
milk was obtained. Ratios for individual BDE congeners were calculated
as the more recent concentration divided by the previous concentrations
(Figure S3). No clear trends of changes
in PBDE concentrations over time were discernible across all paired
milk samples. These results contrast with time trends observed for
PBDEs in the northern hemisphere.

In the Great Lakes, PBDE concentrations
in fish peaked mostly from 1999 to 2000.19 Further away from source regions, PBDE concentrations in ringed
seals in East Greenland started to decrease in the early 2000s,30 a trend reported for most Arctic biota.31 PBDEs also decreased in Canadian seabirds with
a significant and rapid decline after 2003.32 An analysis of PBDE mass flows in the U.S. and Canada predicted
penta and octa-BDEs stocks to peak in their use around 2004, whereas
BDE-209 stock peaked in 2008.15 These diverging
trends between the northern hemisphere and our results for the Western
Antarctic suggest that transport of PBDEs to the remote Southern Hemisphere
has been delayed by a decade or so relative to the Arctic region,
which is closer to the primary source region (Figure 3). The vast majority of PBDEs were produced
and used in the northern hemisphere;33 while
they are certainly present in the southern hemisphere, it is unclear
whether PBDEs in Antarctica are predominantly reflecting southern
or northern hemisphere sources.

fur seals (red dotted

dashed line, both left axis), and ratios of BDE concentrations in
fur seal milk sampled twice over several years (blue solid line).

Perinatal vs Nonperinatal
Milk
After breeding, female
fur seals from Cape Shirreff spend up to 8 months away at one of three
foraging grounds (off the Chilean coast, Patagonian shelf break, or
around South Georgia) during the austral winter.34 Perinatal milk thus represents PBDEs accumulated during
the winter migration. In contrast, nonperinatal milk reflects PBDEs
accumulated while foraging offshore Cape Shirreff’s breeding
beaches and any mobilization of PBDEs from lipid reserves. Across
all fur seal milk samples, there were few significant differences
in PBDE concentrations between perinatal and nonperinatal milk. The
exception was for the 2012/2013 sampling period, in which mean ±
SD concentrations of BDE-49 (0.33 ± 0.34 ng/g lipid) and BDE-99
(0.28 ± 0.19 ng/g lipid) in nonperinatal milk were significantly
higher than those in perinatal milk (0.19 ± 0.15 and 0.15 ±
0.10 ng/g lipid, respectively; Mann–Whitney rank sum test p < 0.05). This is consistent with expectations based
on the maternal body burden of lipid-bound pollutants being passed
onto the pup during lactation, particularly in the case of the first
pup.35

The previous discussion was
based on average values from randomly milked fur seals both perinatally
and nonperinatally. Again, milk from several fur seals was sampled
twice during the same season (n = 10: nine from 2011/2012,
one from 2012/2013). We thus compared PBDE concentrations in perinatal
and nonperinatal milk collected from the same individuals, typically
6 weeks apart. There was no significant difference in individual PBDE
congener concentrations between perinatal and nonperinatal milk (Figure 4). On average, fur
seals accumulated similar BDE concentrations during their winter migration
and feeding away from Cape Shirreff as they did while foraging offshore
Cape Shirreff’s breeding beaches. This implies that within
their breeding area and foraging region PBDEs are present in similar
concentrations and/or the importance of mobilizing PBDEs from their
lipid reserves while at Cape Shirreff.

Figure 4 Comparison of BDE concentrations
in perinatal and nonperinatal
milk sampled from fur seals sampled twice during the same season (n = 10). Error bars represent one standard deviation.

The average values mask a wide
range of individual changes in PBDE
concentrations (note large standard deviations in Figure 4). For two fur seals, PBDEs
decreased about 2-fold over the course of their foraging trips around
Cape Shirreff, whereas it increased for two other seals about 2-fold
over this period. Median ratios of nonperinatal divided by perinatal
milk were greatest for BDE-183 and BDE-99 implying preferential accumulation
of these congeners off Cape Shirreff and/or their less-efficient biodilution
within that time period. Overall, profiles of PBDEs in perinatal and
nonperinatal milk were very similar (Figure 4), suggesting similar uptake/metabolism of
these chemicals in fur seals.

In summary, there is a wide range
of trends of BDE concentrations
in individual fur seal milk sampled approximately 9 weeks apart. On
the contrary to expectations, there were no significant trends of
decreasing concentrations once fur seals started feeding off Cape
Shirreff (Figure 4).
This might indicate that fur seals, in some years, forage locally
prior to coming ashore to give birth.

Phytoplankton
Lipid values in phytoplankton were very
low ranging from 0.1 to 6.7%; only samples with lipid values >0.5%
are presented here to avoid biasing PBDE concentrations high.

Phytoplankton ∑7PBDEs ranged from 3.8 to 320 ng/g
lipid with a mean ± SD of 53 ± 76 ng/g lipid (median of
26 ng/g lipid, Table S23). BDE-47 and -99
were the two most prevalent congeners (Figure 5), with detection 97 and 91% of the time,
respectively. Previously reported PBDE concentrations in plankton
in 2005 were 2–3 times lower (Table 1).5 Macroalgae
in the Canadian Arctic similarly contained ∑15PBDEs
at 320 ng/g lipid.11

Figure 5 Average ∑PBDEs
(ng/g lipid) in (a) phytoplankton and (b)
krill per sampling season. Note the uneven interval between years.

Stable isotope analysis of δ15N on phytoplankton
samples resulted in a wide range of values from −1.1 to 6.1‰.
We note that although the dominant composition of the plankton samples
were identified as phytoplankton (i.e., diatoms or Phaeocystis sp.), samples may have some microzooplankton present despite efforts
to remove any nonphytoplankton species. The δ13C
values of phytoplankton also had a large range, spanning from −33
to −19‰, with a mean of −29 ± 0.61‰
(median of −31‰).

Phytoplankton Trends
Few significant correlations were
detected between PBDE phytoplankton concentrations and δ15N values except for the 2010/2011 season, where almost all
congeners detected showed a negative trend of decreasing concentration
with increasing δ15N value. BDE-47, -100, -99, -154,
-153, and ∑7PBDEs versus δ15N all
had significantly negative trends (p < 0.05).

Correlations of phytoplankton PBDE concentrations versus sampling
time were only significant for the 2010/2011 sampling season, in which
all congeners with >30% detection (BDE-28, -49, -47, -100, -99,
-154,
-153, and ∑7PBDEs) have significantly negative trends;
i.e., PBDE concentrations decreased toward the end of austral summer
(p < 0.05). The austral summer 2010/2011 sampling
season, spanning the period from December to March, was longer than
the 2007/2008 or 2009/2010 seasons. The temporal trend in the 2010/2011
austral summer may reflect a spike in concentrations picked up from
the snow/ice melt early in the austral summer, with either a fading
signal or dilution occurring as the season progressed. Legacy organic
contaminants (e.g., PCBs, DDT, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) have
been detected in snow packs and glacial ice from both Arctic and Antarctic
environments, and it has been proposed that in colder regions, where
the timing of the melt may be more concentrated as compared to a temperate
environment, there is a stronger pulse of organic contaminants released
to the surrounding water column.36 Chiuchiolo
et al. in 2004 detected various OCPs and BDEs (-47, -99, and -100)
in phytoplankton and suggested that phytoplankton incorporated POPs
from snow and ice melt. Furthermore, POPs may be removed from the
water column via sedimentation and organic carbon particle export,
which occurs in a relatively short time following phytoplankton blooms
in this region (i.e., December and January).5 Additionally, Geisz et al. in 2008 present further evidence of glacial
meltwater acting as a source of, at least, DDT to the Antarctic marine
food web.24

There was a significant
difference (p < 0.05,
one-tailed two-sample t test assuming unequal variances)
between diatoms and Phaeocystis for BDE-28, -47,
-100, -153, and ∑7PBDEs, with Phaeocystis sp. having greater mean concentrations than diatoms. Similarly,
the mean PBDE concentrations in phytoplankton (δ15N values < 2‰) were greater than the mean of phytoplankton
with possibly greater microzooplankton contamination (δ15N values > 2‰) for BDE-153 (p =
0.036)
and with lower significance for ∑7PBDEs (p = 0.059).

Krill
Average lipid % in krill ranged
from 14 to 33%,
much greater than for phytoplankton. PBDEs were detected in all krill
samples, with lower concentrations and less variation in contaminant
concentrations than was observed for phytoplankton. The average ∑7PBDEs ranged from 0.14 to 3.5 ng/g lipid with a mean ±
SD of 0.61 ± 0.57 ng/g lipid (median of 0.49 ng/g lipid). BDE-47
was the dominant congener present in all size classes of krill, averaging
around 70% of the total composition (Table S24, SI), followed by BDE-28 and -99, respectively. For ∑7PBDEs, juvenile krill (n = 9) had the highest
concentrations among E. superba age
classes with a mean of 0.65 ± 0.27 ng/g lipid, followed by adult
krill (n = 18) with a mean of 0.51 ± 0.78 ng/g
lipid, and gravid krill (n = 7) with a mean of 0.35
± 0.19 ng/g lipid (Figure S2). The
two Thysanoessa sp. krill samples displayed fairly
high concentrations at ∑7PBDEs of 1.2 and 0.66 ng/g
lipid. Previously reported PBDE concentrations in krill in 2005 were
at least 10 times greater than what we measured, possibly indicating
contamination (Table 1).5

Stable isotope analysis was
performed on a subset of each size class of krill, with the exception
of Thysanoessa sp. The δ15N values
(mean ± SD) were similar among the different size classes: 4.0
± 0.58‰ for juvenile krill, 4.2 ± 0.19‰ for
adult krill, and 4.1 ± 0.43‰ for gravid krill. There was
slightly more variability for δ13C values among the
krill age classes; δ13C values (mean ± SD) were:
−24 ± 1.41, −25 ± 0.47, and −23 ±
0.68‰ for juvenile, adult, and gravid krill, respectively.

Trends of Krill
No significant relationships were found
between krill concentration and δ13C or δ15N value. No significant differences (p <
0.05) were found between krill concentration means from the two sampling
years of 2007/2008 and 2010/2011 (Figure 5). When comparing different size classes
of krill (i.e., juveniles vs adults, adults vs gravid, gravid vs Thysanoessa sp.), BDE-47 and ∑7PBDEs were
both found to be significantly higher in juveniles than adults (p < 0.05).

Fish
Lipid values in fish ranged
from 22 to 52%. PBDEs
were not detected in any of the five fish samples. Low masses of BDE-47
and -99 (0.1–0.2 ng/sample) were initially determined, however,
after blank corrections, all PBDEs in fish samples were <LOD (Table 1). Previous studies
have detected PBDEs in Antarctic fish samples, though they have generally
been able to extract larger amounts of tissue.3,4,9,10,37,38 The total ranges of
δ15N and δ13C values for fish samples
were 9.2 to 11 and −24 to −21‰, correspondingly.
For the myctophid fish species, the mean ± SD of δ15N values was 9.5 ± 0.42 and −24 ± 0.24‰
for δ13C. In comparison, the mean ± SD of Antarctic
silverfish δ15N and δ13C values
were both higher (11 ± 0.63 and −21 ± 1.1‰,
respectively) than those of the myctophid fish species.

Implications
Biota from other parts of the world, primarily regions closer to
industrialized areas, have started to see a reduction in PBDE concentrations
as a reflection of their phase-out.17,18,30,32 Time trends of PBDEs
in Antarctic biota strongly demonstrate that a decrease of PBDE concentrations
in Antarctic biota over the last decade has not (yet) occurred. These
surprising results indicate the need for further research to see if
and when PBDE concentrations in the Antarctic will start declining
as reported in the Arctic. Similarly, the phase-out of PBDEs has led
to various novel flame retardants being detected in the environment.39,40 As of yet, it is unclear whether these new flame retardants have
been transported to Antarctica and have been accumulating in Antarctic
biota. This will be an important research area in the near future.

Comparing trends of PBDEs in milk from randomly selected fur seals
over several years were by and large similar to trends of the same
fur seals milked years apart. Results show that there are large variations
in PBDE trends in individuals over time, highlighting the need for
large sample sets to determine representative trends. A better understanding
of time trends in individual seals is warranted but would require
a concerted effort to resample the same individuals over several years,
ideally collecting both perinatal and nonperinatal milk.

The
high concentrations of PBDEs in phytoplankton compared to the
upper trophic level Antarctic fur seal were unexpected but not unprecedented
and illustrate the complexity of the Antarctic food web and sampling
under challenging circumstances (Table S25). For the phytoplankton sample collections on board a ship, we cannot
rule out the possibility of contamination by PBDEs during sampling.41,42 Trends of PBDEs in biota are further complicated by the presence
of point sources, such as snow and ice melt, which can release pollutant
pulses in the austral summer. Finally, the differences in geographic
sampling of biota (which were logistically constrained) and the migratory
nature and diverse diet of Antarctic fur seals further add complexity
to understanding PBDE trends in biota. Monitoring emerging pollutants
in remote regions, such as Antarctica, can highlight important global
trends of contaminants of concern and further our understanding of
long-range transport and global response times to pollutant dynamics.
