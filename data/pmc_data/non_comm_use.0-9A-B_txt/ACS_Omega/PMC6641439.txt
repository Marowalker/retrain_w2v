Accurate
description of solvation structure of a hydrophobic nanomaterial
is of immense importance to understand protein folding, molecular
recognition, drug binding, and many related phenomena. Moreover, spontaneous
pattern formation through self-organization of solvent molecules around
a nanoscopic solute is fascinating and useful in making template-directed
nanostructures of desired morphologies. Recently, it has been shown
using polarizable atomistic models that the hydration shell of a buckminsterfullerene
can have atomically resolved ordered structure, in which C60 atomic arrangement is imprinted. In analyzing any peculiar behavior
of water, traditionally, emphasis has been placed on the long-ranged
and orientation-dependent interactions in it. Here, we show through
molecular dynamics simulation that the patterned solvation layer with
the imprints of the hydrophobic surface atoms of the buckminsterfullerene
can be obtained from a completely different mechanism arising from
a spherically symmetric, short-ranged interaction having two characteristic
lengthscales. The nature of the pattern can be modified by adjusting
solvent density or pressure. Although solute–solvent dispersion
interaction is the key to such pattern formation adjacent to the solute
surface, the ordering at longer lengthscale is a consequence of mutual
influence of short-range correlations among successive layers. The
present study thus demonstrates that the formation of such patterned
solvation shells around the buckminsterfullerene is not restricted
to water, but encompasses a large class of anomalous fluids represented
by two-lengthscale potential.

1 Introduction
Understanding
many important phenomena like protein folding/misfolding,
drug binding, molecular recognition, and micelle and bilayer formation
requires accurate description of water structure around a nanoscopic
solute. Recently, carbon nanotubes (CNT)1−3 and buckminsterfullerene
(C60)4−9 have attracted huge attention in the field of nanomaterials and
nanomedicines because of their unique structures and nonreactive nature.
The use of fullerenes as biosensors8,9 and drug-delivery
agents4,5 requires knowledge on the behavior of fullerenes
in their aqueous solution. Moreover, as proteins have nanoscopic,
hydrophobic patches in contact with water, the nanoscopic fullerene–water
or CNT–water interface is generally used as a model system
in the investigations of hydrophobic hydration and dewetting-induced
aggregation.10−20 In depicting the solvation structure of a fullerene or a CNT, the
azimuthally averaged radial density of the solvent particles around
the solute is generally evaluated and thus the effect of detailed
atomic arrangement of the surface atoms of the solute on the solvation
structure is neglected. In a recent study, using molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation, Levitt and co-workers,21 however, have observed azimuthally resolved C60 hydration
shell with remarkable patterns arising due to self-organization of
water molecules around the fullerene molecule.

Although pattern
formation22−27 through self-organization is well known in Langmuir monolayers,24 lipid monolayers,25 and polymer films,26,27 the same at the nanoscale can
have many technological applications in nanolithography and other
related techniques.28 The formation of
a self-organized structure with specific patterns is generally a consequence
of a competition between two different interactions.29 Many a time, this competition arises between short-range
attractive interactions and long-ranged Coulombic repulsions, as in
the case of magnetic materials.30 When
a solute with a specific surface structure is immersed in a solvent,
arrangement of the solvent molecules surrounding the solute is governed
by a competition between solute–solvent and solvent–solvent
interactions. The patterned hydration layers of the fullerene molecule
have been obtained21 using highly sophisticated
polarizable atomistic models for water and C60. It has
been shown that the pattern formation in the immediate vicinity of
the fullerene molecules is due to solute–water attractive dispersion
interaction and that the same at longer lengthscale is due to long-range
interaction arising from polarization.21 As the water molecules are polar and have orientation-dependent
interactions, it is natural to associate31,32 such pattern formation with the specific properties of water. It
is therefore challenging and intriguing to examine whether a spherically
symmetric model with two characteristic lengthscales can yield such
a patterned solvation structure. It is now well researched that a
spherically symmetric core-softened (CS) pair potential with two lengthscales
corresponding to a hard core and a soft corona can reproduce many
anomalous properties of water.33−42 Initially, a discontinuous water model with a hard core and a repulsive
ramp, parameterized by Jagla,33,34 was shown to exhibit33−40 waterlike structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic anomalies.43 The continuous version of the CS potential,
originally designed by Hemmer and Stell,41 and subsequently parameterized by many groups, has been shown to
exhibit41,42,44−46 a waterlike cascade of structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic anomalies.43 Recent simulations demonstrated that the CS
potential can give rise to different types of phase transitions, such
as liquid–liquid phase transitions35,37 and isostructural solid–solid transitions,47 which are generally unusual for spherically symmetric one-component
fluids. The CS model also captures beautiful stripe formation in a
two-dimensional (2D) material.29 Not only
that the bulk anomalous properties and unusual phase transitions are
exhibited, waterlike solvation thermodynamics48 of nonpolar solutes has also been mimicked by the coarse-grained
(CG) core-softened potential. More remarkably, the study48 has been successfully extended to polymeric
hard-sphere system, for which microscopic density fluctuations do
not obey Gaussian statistics. Apart from reproducing bulk properties
of waterlike fluids, the CS potential has recently been applied to
mimic various nanoscopic hydrophobic solutes in water49−52 as well. Given that the spherically symmetric two-lengthscale potential
can predict bulk as well as interfacial properties of waterlike fluids
reasonably well, we expect it to be successful in reproducing patterned
solvation layers around a fullerene (C60) molecule immersed
in a CS fluid. In essence, our main objective here is to verify whether
a simple, spherically symmetric, two-lengthscale model for waterlike
anomalous fluids can reproduce hydration patterns around the fullerene
molecule as obtained from polarizable atomistic water model. Moreover,
the long-range order observed by Levitt and co-workers21 was due to polarization, and it is therefore
of interest whether the present nonpolar model can reproduce the long-range
order. If such pattern formation at a longer lengthscale is observed
for the present nonpolar model, then the mechanism of forming such
long-range order will also be of interest.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Imprints of the C60 Atomic Structure
on Its First Solvation Layer
It is quite common to consider
the surface of a C60 molecule to be homogeneous53−56 and thus the conventional C60–solvent radial distribution
function (RDF)56 is generally used to gauge
the ordering of the solvent particles around the fullerene molecule.
However, C60 has a truncated dodecahedron (soccer ball)
structure, in which there are 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal faces.
It is therefore of interest to know whether the present CS model of
fluid can depict the effect of the truncated dodecahedron structure
of C60 on its surrounding solvation layers. To account
for this effect, we apply a newly developed21 concept of azimuthal distribution function (ADF), which is a modified
version of the spatial distribution function (SDF) developed earlier57,58 (see Models and Methods). The ADFs of solvent
particles in a thin layer of 0.1 Å thickness around the C60 (at a distance r* = 2.09 (6.625 Å)
from the center of the C60) are shown in Figure 1 for different solvent densities
at a fixed temperature of T* = 0.25. At the lowest
density ρ0 = 0.07 considered here (Figure 1A), remarkable azimuthal ordering of solvent particles
is observed with solvent particles preferentially occupying all of
the hexagonal faces of C60, keeping all of the pentagonal
faces unoccupied (20 bright spots in Figure 1A correspond to high-density regions at the
middle of 20 hexagonal faces). It is important to note that these
high-density spots are at the middle of the hexagonal faces. At an
increased density of ρ0 = 0.16 of the solvent, because
of increased pressure, solvent particles occupy the middle of all
of the pentagonal faces as well, but the density at the middle of
the pentagonal faces is lesser than that on the hexagonal faces (see
20 brighter spots on the hexagonal faces compared to 12 not so bright
spots on pentagonal faces in Figure 1B). Similar results have been observed by Levitt and
co-workers21 with their sophisticated polarizable
models for water and C60. With further increase in bulk
density to ρ0 = 0.24, all of the hexagonal and pentagonal
faces are occupied by the solvent molecules with almost equal probability
(see 32 equally bright spots in Figure 1C). At ρ0 = 0.4, due to increased
pressure, more and more solvent particles occupy positions corresponding
to the middle of both the five- and six-membered rings (Figure 1D). However, the solvent particles
on the hexagonal faces are distributed over a region of triangular
shape. At even higher densities (Figure 1E), similar picture remains, but now on each
of the hexagonal faces there are three vertices (of a triangle) pointing
toward other high-density vertices in the neighboring six-member rings.
We observe that the vertices are not directed toward the adjacent
five-membered rings. At ρ0 = 0.8, both the pentagonal
and hexagonal faces are occupied by the solvent particles. It is interesting
to observe that even at this high density, the positions corresponding
to all of the carbon atoms and C–C bonding regions of the C60 molecule remain unoccupied (Figure 1F) by the solvent particles. Thus, the imprint
of the C60 surface structure is clearly visible to the
solvation layer adjacent to the fullerene surface. It transpires from
the above observations that at lower densities hexagonal faces are
preferred to pentagonal faces by the solvent particles. To examine
it, the solute–solvent potential energy map is calculated by
placing a CG waterlike solvent molecule over the entire surface of
a bare fullerene molecule (no solvent–solvent interaction is
taken into account), and it is shown in Figure 2A. Darker and larger spots at all of the
hexagonal faces in the energy map indicate (see Figure 2A) that the fullerene–solvent van
der Waals attractive well is wider and deeper at the middle of the
hexagonal face compared to that at the pentagonal face (see that the
dark black spot is present at the middle of the hexagonal face but
not at the middle of the pentagonal face). Average number of solvent
particles ⟨N⟩ in the first solvation
shell (boundary is defined by the first minimum of C60–solvent
RDF) as a function of bulk solvent density and C60–solvent
RDF gC60–solv(r) for different bulk densities of the solvent are shown
in Figure 2B,C respectively.
The average number of solvent particles ⟨N⟩ in the first solvation shell increases linearly at lower
bulk densities until it reaches a plateau at higher bulk densities.
The RDF plots show that the nature of the C60–solvent g(r) is almost the same for ρ0 up to 0.24 (see Figure 2C), and for bulk densities more than 0.4, a new peak
develops at r* = 3.0. In Figure 2D, we show the energy map considering both
C60–solvent and solvent–solvent interactions
obtained from a configuration, in which each of the pentagonal and
hexagonal faces (except the one on which we place a test solvent molecule)
is occupied by a solvent particle (see Models and
Methods).

Figure 1 Short-range ADFs for local density of waterlike solvent
in front
of the first solvation shell of C60. The 60 carbon atoms
of C60 are shown as black dots. Solvent densities are calculated
by considering waterlike solvent particles in a spherical layer of
width 0.1 Å around the C60. The middle of the spherical
layer is at 6.63 Å (r* = 2.09) (corresponding
to the first vertical dotted line in Figure 2C) from the C60 center, and the
local waterlike solvent density patterns shown in (A)–(F)
are for different bulk densities of the CG waterlike solvent. The
pattern formation due to preferential solvation of the C60 surface is evident. (A) For bulk density ρ0 = 0.07,
local waterlike solvent density is only on the 20 hexagonal faces,
whereas all of the 12 pentagonal faces of C60 remain empty,
giving rise to an icosahedral pattern of peaks.21 (B) At ρ0 = 0.16, all of the hexagonal
and pentagonal faces are covered with CG waterlike solvent particles,
but the density on the hexagonal face is higher than that on the pentagonal
face. (C) At ρ0 = 0.24, both the hexagonal and pentagonal
faces are covered with almost equal-density waterlike solvent leading
to 32 vertex object known as a pentakis dodecahedron.21 (D–F) At higher densities, the pattern is different
from that in (A)–(C). The ADF presented in the present study
is scaled by the highest density.

solvent particles occupying the centers of the remaining faces of
the C60. In the inset, the energy map inside a six-membered
ring is enlarged to show three low-energy wells (green spots) forming
a triangular shape with each vertex directed toward the nearest six-membered
ring. The black dots are the carbon atoms of C60.

2.2 Long-Range
Azimuthal Ordering
It
is interesting to examine whether the azimuthal ordering observed
in the close vicinity of the solute surface (at a distance of r* = 2.09, i.e., 6.63 Å from the C60 center)
is long-ranged and extends throughout the first solvation shell. In Figure 3A–F, the ADFs
of solvent particles in the entire first solvation shell (i.e., considering
all of the solvent particles in the first solvation shell) at different
solvent densities are shown. A similar pattern to that observed in Figure 1A–C is observed
for bulk densities ρ0 = 0.07, 0.16, or 0.24 (see Figure 3A–C), revealing
that the same order as that observed in a thin layer surrounding the
C60 molecule (at r* = 2.09) persists throughout
the first solvation shell. However, the pattern changes for bulk densities
of ρ0 = 0.4 and above (Figure 3D–F). Looking at the plots of average
number of solvent particles in the first solvation shell ⟨N⟩ as a function of density (see Figure 2B), it is evident that at ρ0 = 0.24, there are almost 32 solvent molecules around the
C60. Because there are 32 faces on a C60 surface,
one can assume that the middle of all of these 32 faces is filled
by the solvent particles. It is corroborated by the existence of almost
equally bright spots on all of the 32 faces of the dodecahedron, as
shown in Figure 3C
at ρ0 = 0.24. However, the pattern changes significantly
at and above the bulk density of 0.40. The change in the pattern at
and above the bulk density of ρ0 = 0.24 is caused
by the preferential accumulation of additional (in excess of 32) solvent
particles in the first hydration shell. We see that the value of ⟨N⟩ in Figure 2B at ρ0 = 0.4 and above is more than 32.
At ρ0 = 0.4, all of the pentagonal sites are of the
same solvent density (see Figure 3D) as those in case of ρ0 = 0.24.
The solvent particles in excess of 32 are, therefore, have accumulated
preferentially in the hexagonal face, but not distributed uniformly.
The solvent particles are arranged in an alluvial fan-shaped (Y-shaped)
pattern (see Figure 3D) on the hexagonal face. We note that this pattern is formed due
to the growth of high-density vertices (cf. Figure 1E) toward the same in the adjacent six-membered
rings (see Figure 3D). In the inset of Figure 3D, the enlarged view of the high-density region on top of
one of the six-membered carbon rings is shown. It is consistent with
the observed triangular shape of the low-energy region on top of a
six-membered ring, as shown in the inset of Figure 2D. The additional particles at even higher
bulk density of ρ0 = 0.6 are then accumulated along
the line joining the centers of two adjacent six-membered rings and
thus we observe the high-density lines joining centers of all of the
hexagonal faces surrounding a pentagonal face (see red and purple
contours in Figure 3E). At ρ0 = 0.8, the solvent particles are spread
all over the surfaces except for the positions corresponding to carbon
atoms and bonding regions of C60. To gain further insight,
we dissect the first solvation shell for ρ0 = 0.4
into three layers (Figure S2 of Supporting
Information (SI)) of equal width. The ordering observed in Figure 3D,E is a consequence
of accumulation of additional particles in the subsequent layers within
the first solvation shell (see Figure S2B,C). It is also important to note that the accumulation of solvent
particles at different sublayers of the first solvation shell is complementary
to each other (see Figure S2 and the corresponding
discussion in the SI). It suggests that the azimuthal ordering in
subsequent layers proceeds due to short-range correlation arising
due to excluded volume effect. The triangular density pattern (Figures 1D,E and 3D,E) at the hexagonal faces suggests that this face
is not energetically homogeneous; instead, a triangular low-energy
region exists on this face. However, the energy plot in Figure 2A obtained by considering only
C60–solvent interaction (neglecting solvent–solvent
interaction) suggests that the middle of both the pentagonal and hexagonal
faces is energetically homogeneous (as we have found all spots circular
in Figure 2A). This
is true for a low-density system, in which interparticle distances
are large and thus the solvent–solvent interaction is negligible.
That is why, at lower bulk densities, we observe circular bright spots
on both the pentagonal and hexagonal faces, indicating that the solvent
particles are homogeneously distributed on the central region of the
pentagonal or hexagonal face, if occupied. For a high-density system,
in which solvent–solvent correlation is significant, both C60–solvent and solvent–solvent interactions are
to be considered and therefore we have calculated a modified energy
map by considering only a single layer of 32 solvent particles (one
particle is placed on the middle of each face) on the C60 surface. We remove one solvent molecule from a particular face and
place a test solvent particle at different positions on that face
(keeping other 31 solvent particles in the prefixed positions) and
calculate the energy of the test solvent particle with the remaining
31 solvent particles as well as with all of the carbon atoms of the
C60 molecule. We repeat the calculation for all of the
faces. The two-dimensional energy map is shown in Figure 2D. Now, we observe (see Figure 2D) the triangular
region of low energy on the hexagonal faces. Thus, it justifies the
triangular pattern on the hexagonal faces in the ADFs at higher densities
(cf. Figures 1D,E and 3D,E), where solvent–solvent interaction is
important.

2.3 Does
Azimuthal Ordering Extend beyond First
Solvation Shell?
To examine whether this azimuthal ordering
extends beyond the first hydration shell, we have analyzed the density
map of a 0.1 Å slice of solvent layer in the beginning of the
second/third hydration shell at around r* = 3.78,
i.e., 11.98 Å (shown by second dotted line on the RDF of Figure 2C) and found (Figure 4A,B) that for ρ0 = 0.07 and 0.16 the azimuthal ordering persists and the ordering
is complimentary (as the pentagonal faces are now denser than the
hexagonal faces) to that in the first solvation shell (cf. Figure 1A,B). At ρ0 = 0.24 and 0.4, the long-range order ceases to manifest and
a randomized solvent structure with almost homogeneous density over
the entire surface is observed (see Figure 4C,D). It will be clear if we look at the
RDF plots of Figure 2C. At bulk densities up to ρ0 = 0.16, the region
between the first (at r* = 2.12) and second (at r* = 4.25) g(r) peaks
is devoid of any solvent particles (see Figure S3 in SI) and thus the effect of the azimuthally ordered structure
of the first solvation shell extends up to the second solvation shell,
giving rise to a complimentary order at the second solvation shell.
At ρ0 = 0.24 and 0.4, some solvent particles occupy
the interlayer region, but with no specific ordering and due to these
randomized solvent particles, the effect of the ordered first solvation
shell does not extend up to the second solvation shell and therefore
we cannot have azimuthally ordered second shell. However, at densities
ρ0 = 0.6 and above, a new peak (at r* = 3) originates between the first peak and the one at r* = 4.0 in the RDF (cf. Figure 2C). Because of these radially ordered water molecules
at r* = 3.0, a significant but different pattern
is observed (see Figure 4E,F) in front of the second solvation shell (at a distance r* = 3.78 from the C60 center). The reemergence
of the pattern at ρ0 = 0.6 and 0.8 is a result of
short-range correlation arising due to the intervening solvation layer
at r* = 3 at higher densities. It is important to
note that the long-range order seen by Levitt and co-workers21 was a consequence of long-ranged interaction
due to polarization, whereas the long-range azimuthal ordering observed
in the present study is due to short-range correlation.

solvent densities are calculated for CG waterlike solvent in a spherical
shell of 0.1 Å thickness around the C60. The middle

= 3.78) from the center of the C60. (A–F) ADFs at T* = 0.25 for different bulk solvent densities (ρ0) as indicated in the legend.

2.4 Role of C60–Water Attractive
Dispersion Interaction
It is important to assess the role
of small attractive C60–water attractive dispersion
interaction, which is generally thought59 to be inconsequential in determining liquid structure, on the pattern
formation. We performed a new simulation of the C60–solvent
system, in which the interaction between the carbon atom of the C60 and the solvent particle is made purely repulsive (λ
= 0 in eq 2; see Models and Methods and SI) and the density of the solvent is considered to be ρ0 = 0.07. The ADF of the solvent molecules in a thin layer
of width 0.1 Å at a radial distance of r* =
2.09 from the C60 center is shown in Figure 5. No azimuthal ordering in the ADF in this
case (see Figure 5)
has been observed. Thus, the pattern on the C60 surface
is a consequence of solute–solvent attractive van der Waals
interaction, and the same has been shown earlier.21

Figure 5 Short-range ADF for local density of waterlike solvent particles
present in front of the first solvation shell of C60 at
a bulk density ρ0 = 0.07 when the interaction between
the carbon atoms of C60 and the CG waterlike solvent particle
is purely repulsive (λ = 0 in eq 2). No pattern (randomized waterlike solvent particles
all over the C60 surface) observed in this case indicates
the importance of C60–waterlike solvent particle
van der Waals interaction in the pattern formation in the immediate
vicinity of the solute.

3 Conclusions
In essence, using a simple,
spherically symmetric, two-lengthscale
model for water, we are able to demonstrate beautiful pattern formation
on the solvation layer of C60 and, more importantly, the
pattern can be modified by changing the bulk density of the solvent.
The effect of solute structure on the surrounding solvent ordering
extends up to a distance of 11.98 Å from the C60 center.
It is demonstrated that although the attractive solute–solvent
van der Waals interaction is responsible for such pattern formation
in the immediate vicinity of the solute, the change in the pattern
at higher densities is a consequence of both solute–solvent
and solvent–solvent interactions. Contrary to earlier study,21 in which the long-range effect of the surface
structure of the C60 molecule was shown to be a consequence
of the long-range interaction due to polarization, in the present
investigation, as we have used nonpolar and nonpolarizable models,
the long-range azimuthal ordering observed is due to short-range correlation
among the adjacent radially ordered layers. Thus, the core-softened
model not only reproduces anomalous bulk properties33−42,44−46 and solvation
thermodynamics,48 but also captures the
formation of remarkable patterns on the solvation layers of a fullerene
molecule and the long-range nature of the pattern formation. The core-soft
model not only reproduces properties of waterlike hydrogen-bonded
(HB) liquids, but also represents a large class of non-HB materials
with anomalous behavior, e.g., Te, Ga, S, Bi, Ge15Te85, graphite, silica, phosphorous, silicon, and BeF2. This pattern-formation ability at the nanoscale can therefore be
utilized to generate patterned layers of any of these materials using
a structurally patterned template like fullerene. The present study
will pose a challenge to experimentally observe such patterns at the
nanoscale. The nonpolarizable, classical–mechanical description
adopted in the present study excludes any possibility of charge transfer
as observed60 in a recent DFT study on
the C60–water system.

4 Models
and Methods
Here, we consider an atomistic C60 immersed in a box
of solvent molecules interacting with each other through a spherically
symmetric two-lengthscale potential. We use a coarse-grained model
for the solvent (water or any anomalous liquid), and the solvent–solvent
interaction is represented by a spherically symmetric model potential
with two lengthscales. This potential was originally designed long
back by Hemmer and Stell41 by combining
the Lennard-Jones potential with a Gaussian function, and the dimensionless
form of this model potential form can be expressed as 1  where a and c, respectively, are
dimensionless parameters associated with the
height and width of the Gaussian part of the potential. The parameter
σ in the above equation is the usual size parameter. We have
considered a = 5.0, c = 1.0, and r0/σ = 0.7, which represents a two-lengthscale
potential, consisting of a hard core and a soft corona (see labels
in Figure S1a) represented by a repulsive
shoulder (see Figure S1a of the Supporting
Information (SI)). This potential of water represents most of the
structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic anomalies of real water.33−42,44−46,48−52 The fullerene molecule is however described by atomistic model,
in which a C60 molecule consists of 60 carbon atoms. Each
carbon atom of the C60 molecule is modeled as an uncharged
sp2 carbon atom with nonbonded potential parameters taken
from the literature.53 The dimensionless
interaction potential Uuv(r) between the carbon atom of C60 and the CG solvent particle
is modeled by 2  where the parameter λ tunes the attractive
interaction between the atoms of the C60 with the CG waterlike
solvent particle and thus dictates hydrophobicity of the C60 molecule. The solute–solvent potential Uuv(r) with λ = 0 represents a purely
repulsive C60–water system with maximum hydrophobicity
(see red curve in Figure S1b) and that
with λ = 1 corresponds to full van der Waals dispersion interaction
corresponding to force-field parameters for the carbon atom σC = 3.47 Å and εC = 0.2765 kJ/mol53,61 (see blue curve in Figure S1b). The interparticle
potentials Uvv(r) and Uuv(r) with λ = 0 and
1 are shown in Figure S1a,b respectively.
All of the quantities are made dimensionless by suitable scaling,
e.g., distance r* = r/σvv, temperature T* = kBT/εvv, density ρ0 = ρσvv3, pressure P* = Pσvv3/εvv, and where kB is
the Boltzmann constant and εvv and σvv are the energy and length parameters of the solvent, respectively.
For scaling, we use water parameters σvv = 3.17 Å
and εvv = 0.6502 kJ/mol corresponding to nonbonded
parameters of water oxygen according to SPC/E model.62 The cross parameters are obtained using the Lorentz–Berthelot
mixing rule. All of the simulations in this study were performed using
an MD simulation code developed by us. A box of solvent molecules
corresponding to a particular density ρ0 is simulated
in NVE ensemble, and the temperature of the system is fixed by applying
velocity scaling technique. During simulation, periodic boundary conditions
and minimum image conventions are employed in all three directions.
In each simulated system, the velocity scaling is performed in the
first 50 000 steps and after that velocity scaling is stopped
and additional 150 000 steps running in normal NVE simulation
are discarded for equilibration. In each of the systems, a production
run of 107 steps with the trajectories saved at an interval
of 20 steps is used for final analyses.

4.1 Azimuthal
Distribution Function (ADF)
A three-dimensional (3D) representation
of solvent densities around
a solute of any arbitrary shape can be obtained from the spatial distribution
function (SDF) introduced by Kusalik and Svishchev.57,58 In this method, particles are accumulated in a three-dimensional
bin using polar coordinates of solvent particles with respect to the
solute and finally density in each bin is calculated with a proper
normalization. However, to get a complete spatial arrangement of solvent
molecules with respect to the arrangement of surface atoms of the
C60, a two-dimensional bin at a particular radial distance
with azimuthal resolution is essential. Recently, Levitt and co-workers21 have introduced a modification of SDF known
as azimuthal distribution function (ADF). They used the concept of
Sanson–Flamsteed projection, also known as the Mercator equal-area
projection method,63 which is generally
used to draw geographical maps. For details, the reader is referred
to ref (21) and its
Supporting Information. Here, we have used the same technique to account
for azimuthal ordering, if any, in the surrounding solvent of a buckminsterfullerene.

For calculating the ADF for the front of the first solvation shell,
a 0.1 Å spherical shell of solvent molecules situated at a distance
of r* = 2.09 (6.625 Å) measured from the center
of the C60 is considered. In case of ADF beyond the first
solvation shell, a spherical shell of 0.1 Å thickness around
a distance of r* = 3.78 (11.98 Å) is considered.
Apart from these two cases, we have also considered the entire first
solvation shell (defined by the first minimum in the C60–water RDF) for ADF calculation. For comparison among the
ADFs at different densities, all azimuthal density values are scaled
by the highest value of the same at a particular bulk density. The
positions of the carbon atoms of the C60 are also mapped
onto the same θ–ϕ plane.

4.2 Energy
Maps
The energy map considering
only solute–solvent interaction is shown in Figure 2A. It is obtained by placing
a test solvent molecule everywhere in a spherical layer (over the
C60 surface) at a distance of r* = 2.09
from the center of C60 and calculating the interaction
of this solvent molecule with all of the atoms of the C60 (no other solvent molecules than the test molecule are considered).
Finally, these energy values are mapped in the θ–ϕ
(corresponding to latitude and longitude) plane in the same way as
the density values are mapped in the case of ADF along with the positions
of carbon atoms of C60. The neglect of the interwater interaction
in calculating the energy map is a good approximation for systems
with lower bulk densities. However, at larger bulk densities, it is
important to consider water–water interaction along with C60–water interaction when calculating the energy map.
Therefore, we consider a representative configuration with water molecules
occupying the centers of all of the faces of C60. Then,
we remove a water molecule from one face, on which we place a test
water molecule at different positions on that face and calculate the
interaction energy of the test water molecule with all of the other
31 water molecules and 60 carbon atoms of C60. The same
procedure is followed for all of the faces of C60. These
energy values are then mapped onto the θ–ϕ plane
along with the positions of the carbon atoms of C60. The
energy map thus calculated is shown in Figure 2D.
