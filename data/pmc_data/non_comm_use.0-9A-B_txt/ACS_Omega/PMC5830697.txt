Organic
semiconductors (OSCs) are promising materials for cost-effective
production of electronic devices because they can be processed from
solution employing high-throughput techniques. However, small-molecule
OSCs are prone to structural modifications because of the presence
of weak van der Waals intermolecular interactions. Hence, controlling
the crystallization in these materials is pivotal to achieve high
device reproducibility. In this perspective article, we focus on controlling
polymorphism and morphology in small-molecule organic semiconducting
thin films deposited by solution-shearing techniques compatible with
roll-to-roll systems. Special attention is paid to the influence that
the different experimental deposition parameters can have on thin
films. Further, the main characterization techniques for thin-film

1 Introduction
Organic semiconductors
(OSCs) have emerged as promising materials
for cost-effective production of new flexible electronic devices because
they can be processed from solution and at temperatures compatible
with polymeric substrates. Traditionally, thin films of small-molecule
semiconductors were deposited employing vacuum-based processes and
investigated as active materials in organic field-effect transistors
(OFETs). Nonetheless, the advances in the design of new small molecules
with higher solubility have allowed depositing them with solution-based
methods.1 Hence, OFETs fabricated utilizing
different solution deposition techniques have been reported in the
last few years exhibiting impressive field-effect mobility values.2−11 To raise industrial interest, though, it is crucial that such deposition
techniques are simple, cheap, and compatible with scalable and high-throughput
processes such as roll-to-roll. In this direction, solution-shearing
techniques are highly appealing (Figure 1).12,13

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of some of the most common solution-shearing
deposition techniques that are mentioned in this paper.

Another critical issue in the field of organic
electronics is achieving
high device-to-device reproducibility. The charge transport in OSCs
is ruled by anisotropic intermolecular interactions, and hence controlling
thin-film morphology and molecular packing is essential.14 Because organic molecules are held together
by weak nondirectional van der Waals forces, they are expected to
exhibit many alternative packing arrangements, with minor differences
in structure and energy, leading to polymorphism. Different polymorphs
can have electronic performances that differ by orders of magnitude.15−17 Access to each polymorph depends on both kinetic and thermodynamic
parameters and stems from the weak molecule–molecule and molecule–solvent
interactions that are established, which depend on parameters such
as the crystallization rate or temperature applied.18 Thin-film morphology also plays an important role as it
determines the number of grain boundaries and its anisotropy.

In this perspective article, we focus on controlling crystallization
and thin-film morphology in small-molecule organic semiconducting
thin films prepared by solution-shearing techniques. It will be shown
that the modification of the deposition parameters has a strong influence
on the thin-film formation, which in turn affects the electrical characteristics
of the device. The progress in the understanding of this complex scenario
will result in the fabrication of more highly performing devices with
higher reproducibility, key for the future of organic electronics.

2 Solution-Shearing Techniques
In general terms, the
solution-shearing method consists of dragging
a solution meniscus formed in between a substrate and a top element,
such as a bar, blade, or nozzle, by the movement of the substrate
or the top element. Typically, both the dragging speed and the substrate
temperature can be controlled. In Figure 1, some of the most common specific techniques
used in the literature are schematically represented. In the zone-casting
technique, the solution is supplied continuously by a nozzle at a
casting rate in the range of micrometers per second obtaining highly
oriented crystalline films.19−21 The slot-die-coating technique,
widely used in the paint industry, allows the continuous deposition
of a high volume of solution through a slot in a determined crystal
growth direction.22 The deposition by hollow
capillary writing is accomplished by allowing the solution microdroplet
at the end of a hollow pen to contact the surface and then laterally
translating the pen, typically at a rate of 0.1–4.0 cm·min–1.23 Recently, the well-known
wire-bar-coating technique, where a wired bar in contact with a substrate
is used to spread a solution, has been adapted for the deposition
of OSCs. For instance, the bar coating makes use of a smooth cylindrical
bar placed a few hundred microns above a heated substrate.24 Another derived technique is the blade coating,
which consists of shearing a solution placed between a heated substrate
and a blade, typically with a tilt angle of 8°.5,6,25

3 Thin-Film
Preparation
The basic parameters that can be tuned in a solution-shearing
experiment
are the substrate temperature and the shearing speed, that is, the
rate at which the substrate or the top bar/blade/nozzle is dragged
(Figure 2). Such parameters
have a strong influence on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the
OSC crystallization. Undoubtedly, parameters such as the device materials
used, surface treatments, and solution formulation also determine
the film morphology and crystallinity. Further, the application of
external stimuli such as an electric field during the deposition process
can cause some alterations. In the following section, we overview
the impact that all of these experimental parameters can have on the
thin-film structure and morphology. Post-treatments13 such as solvent or temperature annealing have not been
considered here because they are, in principle, less appealing for
fast device manufacturing.

3.1 Coating Shearing Speed
The coating
shearing speed has a strong influence on the crystallization and nucleation
processes. The most obvious effect is related to the thin-film texture.
In several works, it has been demonstrated that at low speeds in the
convective regime, oriented nearly single-crystalline films can be
produced because the crystallization takes place at the meniscus contact
line as the solvent is evaporated.8,21,22,26−32 However, at higher speeds, the crystallization occurs thanks to
nucleation and coalescence from a supersaturated solution. This tendency
can be clearly observed in Figure 2b–f.8 In this work,
the OSC 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethinyl)pentacene) (TIPS-Pen) is
deposited via blade shearing at speeds ranging from 0.4 to 8 mm·s–1, leading to thin-film morphologies that vary from
comet-shaped long crystals to isotropic spherulitic crystalline domains.
Such single-crystal-like films were also previously achieved using
the zone-casting technique, where a solution of an OSC was supplied
through a stationary flat nozzle onto a substrate moving very slowly
at 0.02–0.03 mm·s–1.21,30,33 The electrical anisotropy was investigated
in a zone-casted thin film of a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivative
giving higher field-effect mobilities (μ) along the casting
direction with an anisotropy ratio (μ∥/μ⊥) of up to 102.34

In addition to tuning the grain structure, the solution-shearing
speed can also have an impact on the OSC lattice strain.18 Giri et al. reported that increasing the shearing
speed in the deposition of TIPS-Pen films at elevated temperatures
induces a decrease in the π–π stacking distance
from 3.33 to 3.08 Å (Figure 2g).8 Accordingly, the charge
carrier mobility increased from 0.8 cm2 V–1 s–1 for unstrained films deposited at 0.4 mm·s–1 to a high mobility of 4.6 cm2 V–1 s–1 for a strained film prepared at 2.8 mm·s–1 (Figure 2h), which was attributed to an improved electronic coupling
between molecules. This was rationalized in terms of how the crystallization
took place. In a deposition experiment where the solvent evaporates
slowly, such as in drop-casting, the crystallization occurs near the
substrate–liquid interface and the crystal growth is fed by
molecules from the bulk of the solution (Figure 3a). On the contrary, under fast drying conditions,
typically, the crystallization initiates at the air–liquid
interface and proceeds toward the substrate, spatially confining the
crystallization (Figure 3b).26 Generally, during solution shearing
in the convective regime, the liquid film thickness decreases as the
solution-shearing speed increases. In thinner films, there is a steeper
gradient of temperature between the surface that is exposed to the
ambient and the heated substrate. Further, in thinner films, the evaporation
rate is also faster and thus the solution flows toward the growing
crystalline film, without reaching the thermodynamic equilibrium.
Hence, the authors hypothesized that all of these factors promoted
the kinetic trapping of metastable polymorphs above a specific solution
rate.

low evaporation rate and (b) a fast evaporation rate deposition experiment.

In a similar experiment, Headrick’s group investigated
in
situ the crystallization of TIPS-Pen films deposited by the hollow
capillary writing technique using a heated substrate.27,29 They proposed that the large variation in mobility found as a function
of the writing speed in the convective regime was primary because
of the elimination of strain-induced defects, whereas lattice strain
effects played a smaller role. The authors argue that because the
films solidify before reaching the thermal equilibrium with the substrate,
strain is imparted in the films because of the large thermal expansion
coefficient of the solid film compared with the substrate. Such a
strain can be relieved only by cracking or buckling. Because these
effects are dependent on the film thickness, at higher writing speeds,
when thinner films are achieved, buckling and cracking can be eliminated.

We recently demonstrated that the modification in the coating speed
during the deposition of the organic semiconductor dibenzo-TTF (DB-TTF)
blended with polystyrene (PS) by bar-assisted meniscus-shearing method
(BAMS)24,35 at 105 °C can lead to the formation
of either the kinetic or the thermodynamic polymorph (Figure 4a).31 Indeed, X-ray data revealed that the thin-film structure obtained
at 1 mm·s–1 corresponded to the more thermodynamically
stable α-polymorph, whereas the kinetic γ-phase was formed
at higher coating speeds (Figure 4b).36 Morphologically, three
different regions were distinguished depending on the coating speed.
The first region was at the lowest coating speed (1 mm·s–1) where the thickness and roughness were higher and
the domains were smaller because of the high number of nucleation
points giving long but very thin crystallites. The coating speeds
ranging from 3 to 10 mm·s–1 gave rise to very
smooth and thin films characterized by large crystallites. Finally,
in the region with coating speeds above 10 mm·s–1, the films were thicker and the crystallite size domain was smaller.
Plotting film thickness versus coating speed gave a U-shaped curve
in agreement with the three different regimes (Figure 4c). The low coating speed region corresponds
to the capillary or convective regime of the deposition, and it is
governed by the evaporation rate. The viscous drag regime was found
at the highest coating speeds (i.e., above 10 mm·s–1), which is related to the Landau–Levich model.37,38 An intermediate regime, described by both intermixed regimes was
identified,39 which gave the thinner films
with larger crystalline domains. The best device performance was found
in this intermediate regime, achieving a maximum mobility of around
0.25 cm2 V–1 s–1 at
7.5 mm·s–1 (γ-phase). The mobility of
the devices prepared at 1 mm·s–1 that corresponded
to the α-phase of DB-TTF was of the order of 0.05 cm2 V–1 s–1, that is, five times
less than that of the γ-polymorph.

3.2 Substrate Temperature
Substrate temperature
is one of the most used parameters to control the deposition of active
layers in OSCs using thermal evaporation or the drop-casting technique.40−45 In solution-shearing deposition processes, the temperature is selected
based on the boiling point of the solvent used to control the crystallization
rate. However, there are not many examples reporting a systematic
study of the influence of the stage temperature on the thin-film crystallization.31,46 Galindo et al. reported that by adopting a constant solution-shearing
speed (10 mm·s–1) and varying the substrate
temperature in the range of 25–120 °C, the DB-TTF polymorph
purity could be controlled.31 The authors
found a crystal-phase mixture of DB-TTF (i.e., α + γ)
at a low substrate temperature, but above 100 °C, a temperature
close to the solvent boiling point (i.e., PhCl), only γ-phase
was found (Figure 4a,b). Hence, when the substrate temperature is high, the thermodynamic
equilibrium is not reached during the deposition process and only
the kinetic phase is formed. On the contrary, below 100 °C, the
films are still somewhat wet after spreading the solution on the substrate,
and then, the thermodynamic α-phase also coexists with the γ-phase.
Importantly, it was observed that the phase mixture and the grain
boundaries between domains of different phases had a clear negative
impact on the device performance.

It is known that TIPS-Pen
exhibits two polymorphic forms. Form I is formed at a low temperature,
but it shows a bulk phase transition at 124 °C, giving form II.47 By modifying the substrate temperature when
depositing TIPS-Pen by hollow capillary writing, it is also possible
to control the TIPS-Pen polymorph formed.27,48 Form I is formed when the OSC is deposited at room temperature or
at 50 °C, whereas form II is formed at 135 °C. Importantly,
it was demonstrated that form II can be stabilized at room temperature
if the film thickness is below the critical thickness for cracking,
and form I does not show a phase transition when heated to 135 °C.27

3.3 Ink Formulation
Considering the ink
formulation, the choice of the OSC clearly determines the device performance.35 However, other parameters of the ink formulation
also have a key role. The concentration of a given material has a
direct impact on the film thickness (i.e., lower concentration, thinner
films). Hence, the same effects that have been previously observed
by modifying the shearing speed can also be realized by controlling
the concentration of the solution.26,28,29

In general, the solvent is selected to ensure
a good enough solubility of OSCs. Commonly, high boiling point solvents
are chosen (e.g., chlorobenzene, toluene, and tetralin) to control
better the evaporation rate, which is also defined by the substrate
temperature applied.46 Lower evaporation
rates will more efficiently permit the migration and reorganization
of the molecules during the crystallization. Also, the solvent can
have an impact on the nucleation and crystallization depending on
the OSC solubility, molecule solvation, and molecule–solvent
interactions. In the preparation of organic single crystals, it has
been widely known for a long time that different polymorphs can be
obtained depending on the nature of the solvent.49 In solution shearing, this has also been proved in the
blade shearing of TIPS-Pen.26 The authors
found that solvents with a larger molar volume led to the metastable
polymorph, whereas solvents with a smaller molar volume negated almost
completely the effects of the spatial confinement. An interesting
approach is the use of a mixture of two solvents. Playing with a mixture
of anisole and toluene, thin films of TIPS-Pen were prepared by slot-die
coating.22 This OSC has a good solubility
in toluene but not in anisole. Further, toluene has a lower boiling
point. The modification of the ratio between solvents could be exploited
to control the crystallization to achieve an optimized device performance.

The use of a mixture of solvents has also been very recently used
to compensate for the Marangoni flow caused by a temperature-dependent
surface tension gradient near the meniscus line.50 This has a negative impact on the thin-film deposition
and its electrical properties. Interestingly, the authors demonstrated
that by preparing solutions of the OSC with two good solvents exhibiting
different volatilities and surface tensions, it is possible to control
the surface tension gradient at the meniscus to assist the mass transport
of the OSC molecules toward the contact line. In this way, ultrathin
films with better film coverage and showing an improved device performance
could be achieved at higher shearing speeds.

A very powerful
strategy employed in the last few years to fabricate
crystalline OSC thin films of small molecules is the use of polymeric
blends, usually mixing the OSC with an insulating polymer that acts
as a matrix.2,7,9,51,52 This facilitates
the processability of the OSC because the polymer acts as a binder
and helps to overcome issues related to dewetting, which hampers the
film uniformity. Further, the use of blends also promotes the OSC
crystallization that takes place, induced by a vertical phase separation
of the two materials. Solution shearing of blends of OSCs has also
been reported recently, demonstrating that it represents a very successful
route to achieve high OFET performance.24,25,35 In these blend-based inks, more parameters can be
tuned that can have an important influence on the resulting films.
In addition to the type of polymer employed, the molecular weight
(Mw) of a polymer might have a remarkable
effect on the thin film and hence the electrical device characteristics.
The Mw determines the viscosity, solubility,
and miscibility and might cause different stratification processes.
Niazi et al.25 observed that blade-sheared
films of blends of 2,8-difluoro-5,11-bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene
(diF-TES-ADT) and PS revealed higher mobilities when increasing the Mw of PS, which was mainly accounted for the
higher viscosity of the solution that gave rise to crack-free and
smoother crystalline domains (Figure 5a). In the same work, the authors also reported that
the use of solvent mixtures (i.e., a polar and nonpolar solvent) in
which the two components of the blend show different degrees of solubility
can be modified to optimize the thin-film crystal domains.25 Moreover, it has been shown on the blends of
DB-TTF and PS that the ratio OSC/PS can be critical not only to the
film morphology but also to the type of polymorph formed.31 Thin films deposited from blends with more than
50 wt % of DB-TTF content showed oriented crystals along the casting
direction, but they corresponded to a mixture of crystals from the
α and γ polymorphs. On the other hand, thin films deposited
from 1:1 blends or blends containing less than 50 wt % of DB-TTF were
more homogeneous with an isotropic plate-like crystalline domain and
belonged to the γ-polymorph. Finally, it should also be highlighted
that blending the OSC with insulating polymers also offer other advantages
such as the reduction of charge traps at the dielectric/OSC interface53,54 and an enhanced device stability.24,55

3.4 Device
Configuration
During the deposition
of OSCs, a common challenge is to overcome surface dewetting issues
that result in poor film homogeneity or low substrate coverage. This
effect is determined by the surface energy. One of the most commonly
used strategies to control the wettability of silicon dioxide (the
most employed dielectric) is treating it with ozone or argon plasma,
which results in an increase of the surface hydrophilicity that is
often required to ensure solution wettability. Miskiewicz et al. reported
the influence of the SiO2 surface energy on the performance
of TTF-based transistors deposited by zone-casting.56 The authors concluded that a smaller mismatch in surface
energy may result in better molecular packing and consequently more
efficient charge transport. However, higher hydrophilic surfaces are
generally detrimental to the electrical performance of the device
because they generate charge traps. Hence, another approach is to
modify the SiO2 substrate with molecular self-assembled
monolayers (SAMs) that can tune the surface energy depending on the
molecular functional group.57 In solution-shearing
experiments, the meniscus formation and wetting/dewetting aspects
are determined by the surface energy of the substrate and the blade/bar.
Therefore, the growth of SAMs is often applied both on the substrate
and on the oxide-based blades.58 Alternatively,
changing the material of the bar has also been demonstrated to be
a promising route to modify the solution meniscus and hence the resulting
film homogeneity and coverage. Indeed, it was previously shown that
the deposition by BAMS of a blend of the p-type semiconductor meso-diphenyl tetrathia[22]annulene[2,1,2,1] with PS was
successfully achieved only when the metallic bar was replaced with
a highly hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene bar.53 Problems related to dewetting are also encountered when
employing hydrophobic polymeric substrates. When Parylene C and poly(vinylidene
fluoride) were used as dielectrics in devices prepared by solution
shearing of the OSCs, surface treatments with ozone or argon plasma
were required.59,60

In bottom-contact devices,
gold source and drain electrodes can also be modified by SAMs. This
has commonly been done to modify the work function of the electrode
to improve the charge injection, which in turn reduces the contact
resistance, enhancing the device electrical characteristics.61 However, modification of the electrodes can
also affect the morphology of the OSC layer adjacent to the SAM-covered
electrodes. The first nanometers of the OSC layers are highly affected
by the surface affinity and the chemical composition of the SAMs,
which consecutively affects the upper film. The chemical composition
mainly affects the interaction and induces extra nuclei, whereas the
surface affinity affects the drying/crystallization time and thickness
of the film.61 Previously, it was reported
that the use of gold electrodes modified with a pentafluorobenzenethiol
(PFBT) SAM dramatically improved the crystallization of TIPS-Pen and
diF-TES-ADT in spin-coated films.62−65 It was observed that, because
of the contact-induced crystallization, crystals grew from the contacts
and extended 10 μm into the transistor channel (Figure 5b). However, in thin films
of TIPS-Pen and diF-TES-ADT fabricated by blade shearing at 1.5 mm·s–1, PFBT SAMs disrupted the formation of spherulitic
crystalline structures.62 Thus, the authors
concluded that strongly interacting contacts were not suitable for
achieving larger crystalline domains typically obtained by solution-shearing
techniques. In stark contrast, when the same materials were deposited
by BAMS at 10 mm·s–1, it was found that PFBT
SAMs lead to more homogeneous and interconnected crystallites, which
in turn resulted in higher-mobility OFET devices.35 Remarkably, such crystalline domains extended along the
whole channel (in the range of 25–100 μm) (Figure 5b). The discrepancy between
these results can be attributed to differences in the coating speed
and in the solution confinement between the two techniques.

Crystal growth defects are very often observed in rapid solution-coating
processes, such as in solution shearing, where voids or dendritic
growth are found to be detrimental to the charge carrier transport.
This is caused by mass transport limitations. A very interesting approach,
namely, FLUENCE (i.e., fluid-enhanced crystal engineering), was recently
reported aiming at gaining control on the fluid flow to enhance the
crystallization and nucleation during the deposition process.6 FLUENCE consists of introducing specifically
designed three-dimensional micropillars on the blade to induce recirculation
of the ink (Figure 5c). Solution shearing mainly drives mass transport in the coating
direction. The use of micropillars permits a rapid flow expansion
of the solution, improving the lateral mass transport, which is perpendicular
to the shearing direction, causing a more homogeneous crystal growth.
Furthermore, the introduction of micropillars in the blade was combined
with the addition of patterns on the substrate with solvent wetting
and nonwetting regions using SAMs. The design was carried out considering
that nucleation takes place preferentially at highly convex points
along the contact line. Hence, the manipulation of the curvature of
the contact line allows for the control of the crystal nucleation.
Using FLUENCE, the fast coating of TIPS-Pen was demonstrated to give
centimeter-long highly aligned single-crystalline films with a metastable
crystal structure that led to an unprecedented average mobility of
8 cm2 V–1 s–1 (Figure 5c).

As previously
mentioned, depending on the experimental conditions,
anisotropic films can be prepared. In these cases, therefore, the
coating direction, that is, the direction of the solution shearing,
with respect to the channel length is pivotal. An exhaustive study
of the influence of the shearing direction was performed by Lee et
al. in a solution-sheared naphthalene diimide derivative film.32 The devices prepared with the channel length
direction perpendicular to the shearing direction (i.e., angle of
90°) showed a maximum mobility of 0.41 cm2 V–1 s–1, whereas devices with parallel orientation
(0°) exhibited almost one-third of the mobility. The worst mobility
was found in the devices prepared at 45°. This mobility anisotropy
was accounted to be dominated by the grain boundaries and cracks.
In another report, a blend of TIPS-Pen and PS was bar-coated parallel
and orthogonal to the channel length on a Parylene C dielectric with
gold source/drain electrodes.60 It was
observed that the crystal domain dimensions were much smaller on the
devices prepared with the solution-shearing direction parallel to
the channel length, which was ascribed to the step between the gold
contacts and the Parylene C (ranging around 60–80 nm) and also
to the different wettabilities of these materials. Surprisingly, the
change in domain sizes did not make an impact on the mobility of the
two types of devices; however, it caused important differences in
their response to mechanical deformations.

3.5 External
Stimuli: Electric Field
The application of an external stimulus
during deposition can offer
a promising tool to control the packing structure of a given OSC.66 This route has hardly been explored in solution-shearing
processes, although external perturbations during deposition could
potentially have a strong impact. Recently, Molina-Lopez et al. reported
that the application of alternating electric fields can be exploited
to modify the molecular packing of solution-sheared OSCs, specifically
TIPS-Pen and 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene
(C8-BTBT).67 The setup employed is sketched
in Figure 6. A sharp
blade moving at a steady velocity was used to cast the OSC solution,
whereas a difference of electrical potential was maintained between
the blade and the substrate. In this system, voltage and frequency
could be modulated. Strong dielectropheretic (DEP) forces (FDEP) and torques (TDEP), which can cause translational and rotational motion of the molecules,
are expected near the blade edge where nucleation and crystallization
takes place. The experiments were limited to low coating velocities
and low temperatures to give the molecules enough time to move in
the solution. Interestingly, the authors observed a gradual transition
between polymorphs as the DEP force increased, and metastable polymorphs,
some of them unprecedented, were trapped. As a consequence, a twofold
enhancement in the OFET mobilities was found for TIPS-Pen along the
transport direction, and a threefold decrease was observed in the
C8-BTBT films accompanied by an increase in anisotropy.

4 Thin-Film Characterization
To progress
toward the understanding of the influence of morphology
and crystal structure on the charge transport properties, it is of
paramount importance to advance the development of characterization
techniques. The study of the thin-film morphology and the identification
of polymorphs can be realized employing a variety of techniques. POM
is a very accessible tool that gives information about the morphology
of the film as well as its crystallinity. Such information can be
complemented by other microscopy techniques such as AFM, which can
bring out additional information regarding the film thickness or the
terrace heights. To determine the crystal structure, X-ray techniques
are obviously the most powerful ones.68 They provide information related to the crystal packing and also
the orientation of the crystals with respect to the surface. Polarized
absorption and Raman spectroscopies can also be used to find out about
the in-plane orientation of the molecules in thin films.27,34,69 Lattice-phonon confocal Raman
spectroscopy has also been proved to be a highly prevailing tool to
identify OSC polymorphs in thin films because it is very sensitive
to intermolecular interactions.36,70−72

For the characterization of OSCs, thin films are of great
interest
to gain information about the molecular ordering of the molecular
layer close to the substrate. It is known that such a buried interfacial
layer, which might have a different packing than the top layers,73−75 is mainly responsible for the charge transport properties in OFETs.76 Near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy
combined with thin-film delamination77,78 as well as
vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy79,80 has been utilized to investigate such an interfacial layer. More
recently, the combination of Raman spectroscopy and surface-enhanced
Raman scattering has also been shown to afford useful information
related to the interfacial packing of OSCs.28

To be able to predict the polymorph formed in some given experimental
conditions or to optimize the deposition parameters for a certain
material, it is crucial to understand the crystallization mechanisms
that take place.81 For this purpose, it
is hence necessary to develop in situ characterization tools. This
is extremely challenging in solution-shearing processes because OSC
deposition and crystallization occur very rapidly. The introduction
of very powerful laboratory X-ray sources, mainly a synchrotron radiation
source, permits faster measurements due to the higher intensity and
more sensitive diffraction analysis because the wavelength can be
adjusted at Armstrong distance.82 In the
last few years, in situ characterization of the nucleation and crystallization
taking place in solution-sheared thin films have been reported using
microbeam grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (Figure 7 (left)).26,83,84 Acquisition of the reciprocal
space region probed by a fast two-dimensional (2D) X-ray detector
gives information regarding the evolution of the crystallization process
and the formation of transient structures. These studies are often
combined with in situ high-speed POM measurements that are useful
to observe the morphology and crystallinity changes.26,83 Further, in situ optical spectroscopy in the reflection mode has
also been used to investigate the growth mechanism and thermal stability
of solution-sheared TIPS-Pen.27 Spectra
were obtained in the supersaturated region at the meniscus and in
the solid film and evaluated using the setup shown in Figure 7 (right). The response is highly
sensitive on the molecular packing and thermal expansion effects.
Here, the authors concluded that it was likely that the crystallization
process proceeds by the incorporation of molecular aggregates instead
of individual molecules. The progress in in situ characterization
techniques along with suitable theoretical models is definitely of
high importance to progress in this field and achieve a controlled
material crystallization.

5 Outlook
In the area of organic electronics,
it is imperative to find routes
for processing OSCs at high speed while ensuring high device-to-device
reproducibility. OSCs are highly prone to polymorphism because of
the weak intermolecular van der Waals forces. Thus, the access to
different polymorphs depends on the competition between thermodynamics
and kinetics. Further, because of the anisotropic character of the
intermolecular interactions, the electron coupling in the different
directions might vary significantly. Therefore, gaining control of
the thin-film morphology (i.e., domain alignment and gain boundaries)
and the polymorphism is essential. Previously, we discussed some of
the parameters that can be exploited as a tool box to modulate the
thin-film crystallinity and morphology, such as substrate temperature,
speed, ink formulation, and so forth. We tried to address all these
factors separately with the aim of understanding their specific influence.
However, all of these parameters are strongly interrelated, making
this panorama very complex. For instance, depending on the boiling
point of the solvent chosen, different temperatures will be applied,
or achieving an immediate evaporation of the solvent will depend on
both temperature and speed of the bar/blade. The combination of all
these variables determine the driving crystallization regime. It also
seems that adding external stimuli during solution shearing, quite
an unexplored approach, could also bring new tools to control the
resulting thin films.66 Further, technological
advances aimed at achieving a patterned OSC film with a controlled
morphology and structure will probably be a focus of research in the
near future.85 Undoubtedly, to progress
in the control of thin-film structure, it is also key to develop in
situ characterization techniques. Another critical issue that has
been quite overlooked is the study of the time stability of the different
polymorphic forms because they are often metastable, that is, the
thermodynamic form is not the one formed. Further, it should be noticed
that even a low degree of polymorphs mixture, which is sometimes
difficult to detect, can have a very negative impact on the device
performance. Only when the thin-film polymorphism and morphology can
be controlled at will, it will be possible to fabricate highly reproducible,
durable, high-performing organic-based devices.
