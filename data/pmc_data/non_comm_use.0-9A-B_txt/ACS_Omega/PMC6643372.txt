Organic–inorganic perovskites,
(RNH3)2PbX4, have attracted much
attention as one of the most
promising light-harvesting and light-emitting materials. The present
work investigated the steric effects of the organic parts on the perovskites
by varying the alkylamine type and chain length. Primary, secondary,
and tertiary amines with various chain lengths were introduced into
organic–inorganic perovskites. Extending the chain length raised
the phase transition point and shortened the absorption wavelength.
In addition, the introduction of secondary and tertiary amines resulted
in red- and blue-shifting of the absorption peaks, respectively.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide-based
perovskite compounds
have attracted significant attention since the report of their application
to photovoltaic devices by Miyasaka et al. in 2009.1 As the study of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has progressed
over the last several years and new methods of fabricating perovskite
materials and devices have been developed, the power conversion efficiency
of PSCs has increased from 3.8% to more than 20%.2−9 The main advantage of perovskite compounds is the tunability of
their chemical and physical properties, which in turn is derived from
the wide range of possible structures. Typically, three-dimensional
(3D) perovskites having the general formula AMX3 (A = CH3NH3+, Cs+, CH(NH2)2+; M = Pb2+, Sn2+;
X = Cl–, Br–, I–) are composed of corner-sharing metal halide octahedra that connect
in all dimensions with small cations situated in the voids of the
octahedra. Such 3D compounds have been widely studied as light harvesters
in PSCs owing to their outstanding properties, including high extinction
coefficients, moderate band gaps, small exciton binding energies,
and long exciton and charge diffusion lengths.10−12 However, 3D
perovskites are unstable in the presence of moisture and thus rapidly
decompose. Therefore, it is necessary to improve their stability to
permit their use in commercial applications.

Two-dimensional
(2D) perovskites with the general formula A2PbX4 (A = RNH3+; X = Cl–, Br–, I–) naturally
form layered structures consisting of 2D sheets of [PbX6]4– octahedra and organic alkylammonium (RNH3+) layers. Owing to the presence of these hydrophobic
organic layers, such materials exhibit significant stability in the
presence of water. These compounds also show exceptional optical properties
due to the formation of quantum wells. The organic alkylammonium layers
have wide band gaps, whereas the band gaps of the inorganic [PbX6]4– layers are considerably smaller. Consequently,
excitons are confined in the inorganic layers such that these perovskites
behave as ideal 2D materials. This results in unique optical properties
and significant potential for applications in optical devices such
as light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and lasers. These 2D compounds
are often synthesized using simple primary alkylamines, such as butylamine,
pentylamine and hexylamine.13,14 Single X-ray crystallographic
analysis of these compounds revealed that crystal structure of 2D
perovskite with short alkylamines was orthohomobic (Pbca) or monoclinic (P21/a) at room
temperature (r.t.).15 Secondary and tertiary
amines have been rarely applied in iodoplumbate systems, and so the
effects of the type of amine remain unclear. It would be helpful to
investigate such materials, because the influence of additional methyl
groups around the amine sites would be expected to produce a steric
effect at the organic–inorganic interface and so could affect
the optical properties. In the present study, we introduced primary,
secondary, and tertiary alkylamines with chain lengths of 6 or 18
into a 2D perovskite compound to assess the effects of the type of
amine. Furthermore, to examine the effect of chain length, a series
of perovskites was synthesized using primary amines with varying chain
lengths (n = 6, 12, 14, 16, or 18) (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Material employed in
this study to examine the effects of alkylamine
type and chain length.

Results and Discussion
Hydroiodides based on primary, secondary,
or tertiary amines, CnH2n+1NH3I (n = 6, 12, 14, 16, or 18),
CnH2n+1NH(CH3)HI (n = 6 or 18), and CnH2n+1N(CH3)2HI (n = 6 or 18), were obtained by reacting equivalent
amounts of the
corresponding amines, CnH2n+1NH2 (n = 6, 12, 14,
16, or 18), CnH2n+1NH(CH3) (n = 6 or 18), or CnH2n+1N(CH3)2 (n = 6 or 18), with hydroiodic
acid, respectively. Perovskite solutions were prepared by reacting
stoichiometric amounts of these hydroiodides with PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Films of the
resulting (CnH2n+1NH3)2PbI4 (abbreviated as CnPbI), (CnH2n+1N(CH3)H2)2PbI4 (NCnPbI), and (CnH2n+1N(CH3)2H)2PbI4 (NNCnPbI) were fabricated on preheated glass substrates at 100 °C by
spin-coating at 2000 rpm.

Figure 2a shows
the out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of CnPbI films
having n values of 6, 12, 14, 16, and 18. A series
of diffractions corresponding to the interlayer d-spacing between the inorganic layers was clearly observed for each
film. The d-spacing values for CnPbI were 16.3 Å
(n = 6), 24.4 Å (n = 12), 26.9
Å (n = 14), 29.4 Å (n =
16), and 31.9 Å (n = 18), respectively. The d-spacing values along the c-axis increased
in a linear manner with increases in n. Figure 2b presents the UV–vis
absorption spectra of the CnPbI spin-coated films. All CnPbI spin-coated
films generated an exciton absorption band around 500 nm, suggesting
the formation of stable excitons.12−16 However, although C6PbI produced an exciton absorption peak at 514
nm, the peaks of those films having longer alkyl chain lengths (n ≥ 12) appeared in the vicinity of 490 nm.

X-ray diffraction patterns and (b) UV–vis
absorption spectra of CnPbI spin-coated films with n =
6, 12, 14, 16, or 18.

The structural transitions of the perovskite compounds were
investigated
by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Figure 3a shows the DSC curves acquired from CnPbI microcrystals fabricated by a precipitation process using DMF as
a good solvent and dichloromethane as a poor solvent. All compounds
exhibit two phase transition points above r.t., which shift toward
higher temperatures with increasing chain length. These phase transitions
are denoted as I and II.

12, 14, 16, or 18 during the second heating cycle. Photographic images

The associated enthalpy changes determined in this study
are almost
equal to those reported by Billing et al.17 The enthalpy changes for phase transition I were almost
constant regardless of the chain length, whereas the phase transition II enthalpies increased along with chain length. These results
indicate that phase transitions I and II are associated with structural changes in the inorganic and organic
layers, respectively. At r.t., C6PbI was in a different phase from the other compounds.
As the quantum confinement structures in each perovskite were affected
by the inorganic phase transition, the optical properties of C6PbI were different,
as shown in Figure 2b. Each CnPbI film showed color change at its phase transition point,
with the exception of the C6PbI. As shown in Figure 3b, the C12PbI film was yellow at r.t. and turned to orange above 50
°C because of the phase change at 42 °C. On the other hand, C6PbI was orange at both
r.t. and 50 °C, as shown in Figure 3b.

Figure 4a,b shows
the out-of-plane XRD patterns of CnPbI, NCnPbI, and NNCnPbI spin-coated
films having n values of 6 or 18. A series of diffractions
are observed for each sample, indicating that the compounds formed
layered structures. The d-spacing values calculated
from the diffraction peaks are summarized in Table 1. The interlayer spacing of the NNC18PbI was greater than that
of the C18PbI and NC18PbI. Similarly, the NNC6PbI had the largest
interlayer spacing among the three n = 6 samples.
The tertiary amine was larger than primary amine owing to having the
two additional methyl groups around the N atom, and the resulting
steric effects evidently increased the d-spacing.
As for the secondary amines, the effect of an additional methyl group
on the d-spacing value is larger for NC6PbI compared to that for NC18PbI. Although the d-spacing of NC18PbI and NNC18PbI is almost similar, the value of NC6PbI is about 3 Å larger than that of NNC6PbI. This may be
due to the difference of relaxation properties and packing of alkyl
chain.

Table 1 Major XRD
Diffraction Peaks (Less
Than 15°) and d-Spacing Values for CnPbI, NCnPbI, and NNCnPbI (n = 6 or 18)
Figure 5 shows the
in-plane XRD profiles of CnPbI, NCnPbI, and NNCnPbI spin-coated
films. C6PbI showed
a diffraction peak at 14.2° (6.4 Å). The distance between
the Pb and I in this material was 3.2 Å, whereas the distance
to the nearest neighboring Pb ion was 6.4 Å.18 Thus, the octahedra in this compound shared corners with
one another to form an inorganic sheet parallel to the substrate.
In contrast, the NNCnPbI generated a diffraction peak at 11.3°
(7.8 Å), which is larger than that of corner-shared octahedra
(6.4 Å). This implies the distortion of octahedra networks in NNCnPbI. As previously reported,19−21 various modes of octahedral tilting
of perovskite compounds exist. Also, some perovskites with larger
amines formed hybrid structure in which corner-sharing and face-sharing
network of octahedral networks coexsisted.22 The face-sharing octahedra have larger Pb–Pb distance than
that in corner-sharing ones. Therefore, NNCnPbI might have a face-sharing
structure. NC6PbI and NNC6PbI gave
diffraction peaks at 3.1 and 4.3°, which attributed to the interlayer
spacing values between inorganic layers, respectively. This suggests
that the crystalline growth of NC6PbI and NNC6PbI spin-coated films was partially perpendicular to the substrate.

XRD profiles of a series of perovskite films: (a) C18PbI, NC18PbI, and NNC18PbI. (b) C6PbI, NC6PbI, and NNC6PbI.

Figure 6 presents
the UV–vis absorption spectra of CnPbI, NCnPbI, and NNCnPbI spin-coated films. Exciton absorption peaks attributed to quantum
confinement structures were observed for each of the compounds. This
result suggests the formation of stable excitons in the perovskites.
As noted, the CnPbI produced an absorption peak around 500 nm. However,
when the secondary amines were introduced into the perovskite, the NC6PbI and NC18PbI peaks were shifted toward
longer wavelengths by approximately 7 and 33 nm, respectively. Conversely,
including tertiary amines, as in NNC6PbI and NNC18PbI, shifted the absorption toward shorter wavelengths
by about 89 and 54 nm, respectively. Presumably, these shifts in optical
properties were caused by rearrangements of the iodoplumbate frameworks
and affected the band gaps on perovskite. It has been reported that
perovskite with face-sharing octahedra shows blue-shifted peaks than
a standard layered structure.22 By taking
into consideration that NNCnPbI series have face-sharing octadedra
as shown in XRD, the blueshift of absorption bands is reasonable.
We believe that the steric effect of the additional methyl group modified
the quantum confinement structures.

Conclusions
Several 2D perovskites were fabricated, having
primary, secondary,
or tertiary amines with various chain lengths. Our results demonstrate
that the phase transition points increased and the absorption peaks
appeared at shorter wavelengths with increases in the chain length.
Introducing secondary or tertiary amines into the perovskite red-shifted
or blue-shifted the absorption peaks, respectively. These shifts are
attributed to tilting of the inorganic framework due to the steric
effects of the additional methyl groups. These results indicate that
the optical properties of such materials can be modified while retaining
the quantum confinement structure, by changing the type of amine.
Our research could be one of the clues to reveal the influence of
the structure of A-site cation on 2D-layered perovskite for further
applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
Hydroiodic
acid (HI, 57 wt % aqueous solution)
and DMF (super dehydrated) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Ltd. and used as received. Dichloromethane was purchased
from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc. All other chemicals were obtained from
Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. Amine hydroiodides, CnH2n+1NH3I
(n = 6, 12, 14, 16, or 18), CnH2n+1NH(CH3)H2I (n = 6 or 18), and CnH2n+1N(CH3)2HI
(n = 6 or 18) were synthesized by neutralizing CnH2n+1NH2 (n = 6, 12, 14, 16, or 18), CnH2n+1NH(CH3) (n = 6 or 18), and CnH2n+1N(CH3)2 (n = 6 or 18) with stoichiometric amounts of hydroiodic acid, respectively.

Sample Preparation
CnH2n+1NH3I and PbI2 were
dissolved in DMF at 50°C for 1 h to obtain the precursor solutions
for the preparation of [CH3(CH2)n−1NH3I]2PbI4. The concentrations of these solutions were 40 wt % (for X-ray diffraction
measurements) and 10 wt % (for UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
measurements). Similarly, precursor solutions of (CnH2n+1N(CH3)H2)2PbI4 and (CnH2n+1N(CH3)2H)2PbI4 were prepared. Films were fabricated on preheated
hydrophilic substrates by spin-coating at 2000 rpm using a Mikasa
1H-D7 spin coater. The substrates were heated at ca. 100 °C during
the spin-coating process to obtain high-quality films because of the
high boiling point of DMF. Microcrystalline powders were obtained
by pouring the precursor solutions into dichloromethane. After vacuum-drying,
orange powders (n = 6) and yellow powders (n = 12, 14, 16, or 18) of [CH3(CH2)n−1NH3I]2PbI4 were obtained.
