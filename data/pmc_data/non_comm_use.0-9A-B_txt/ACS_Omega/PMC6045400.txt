Here,
we describe a rapid and efficient synthetic method of peptide-conjugated
perylene diimide (P-PDI) using solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS).
Due to severe insolubility of perylene dianhydride (PDA) as a starting
material of perylene diimide (PDI), PDA was initially conjugated with
amino acids to obtain soluble PDI derivatives. Target peptides were
synthesized on a 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin using the SPPS method
and then conjugated with the amino acid-appended PDI. Various conditions
such as loading levels, reaction times and solvents were optimized
for introducing the peptides to both sides of the amino acid-appended
PDI. The final P-PDI was obtained with a maximum yield of 80% in 12
h. Its singlet oxygen-derived phototoxicity on cells was confirmed,
which could be applicable to photodynamic therapy.

1 Introduction
Photodynamic
therapy (PDT) is an efficient method for treating
various types of cancers.1−5 The viability of a cancer cell is suppressed easily by reactive
oxygen species produced by photoactive molecules in the presence of
light. Compared to other radiation therapy, the mechanism of PDT allows
noninvasive cancer treatment. In PDT, various photosensitizers, such
as porphyrin, phthalocyanines, porphycenes, and squaraines, have been
used so far.6−9 Among them, perylene diimide (PDI) has received considerable attention
due to its structural versatility, high fluorescence intensity, and
prominent photochemical stability.10,11 In particular,
water-soluble PDIs have been successfully utilized for biological
studies. For example, PDIs functionalized with β-cyclodextrin
or amino acids show improved hydrophilicity and have been applied
in bioimaging or for therapeutic purpose.12−14 Moreover, PDIs
have absorption and emission maxima of above 500 nm, which can minimize
a background autofluorescence in cells.15

Another promising method for enhancing biological activity
is the
conjugation of peptides to PDIs where peptides are coupled by incorporating
natural or unnatural amino acids sequentially according to their purpose.
As peptides have various functions and are highly biocompatible, these
properties suit well to the necessary conditions in disease detection
and control. In this regard, specially designed bioactive peptide-conjugated
PDIs can function as promising molecules for bio-application with
multiple purposes.

Methodologically, peptides could be directly
condensed to PDA molecules
in molten imidazole.16,17 However, both the N-terminus
of a peptide and the side chain of amino acids can be involved in
the condensation reaction, leading to undesired byproducts. To overcome
such a problem, Tovar et al.18 suggested
a method that could conjugate a diverse array of semiconductor molecules
with peptides through the solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) method
on Wang resin. However, in the case of PDA molecules, an extreme harsh
reaction condition (135 °C, 26 h, refluxing pyridine), together
with the insolubility of PDA and the use of Wang resin as a solid
support, has led to a very low yield of less than <30%.

In
this work, we developed a highly efficient detour method to
overcome the problems in conjugating peptide to PDI by SPPS. Our method
can provide peptide-derived PDI bolaamphiphiles in high yields by
using 2-chlorotrityl chloride (CTC) resin under mild conditions. The
method can be employed in developing various kinds of peptide-conjugated
PDIs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
of Soluble PDI Derivatives
Firstly, insoluble PDA was condensed
with L-alanine
(A), glycine (G), or β-alanine (β-A) in molten imidazole
to produce soluble PDI derivatives (Scheme 1a). Among the products (PDI-[A]2, PDI-[G]2, and PDI-[β-A]2), only PDI-[A]2 was readily soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Both PDI-[G]2 and PDI-[β-A]2 showed poor solubility in
DMF at room temperature. We assumed that the steric hindrance by the
chiral methyl side chain of L-alanine overrode the
π–π interaction between perylene moieties, preventing
the stacking of the perylene core and increasing the solubility of
PDI-[A]2. To figure out the correlation between the π–π
interactions and the solubility of PDI derivatives, we obtained temperature-dependent 1H NMR spectra (Figure S1). With the increase of temperature,
the intensity of perylene core-related peaks (8.4–9.0 ppm)
of PDI-[β-A]2 increased, which means that the solubility
of PDI-[β-A]2 in DMSO became higher,19 while that of PDI-[G]2 remained unchanged. In
addition, with increasing temperature, different propensities in the
change of chemical shift of the perylene core-related peaks were observed
in PDI-[G]2 and PDI-[β-A]2; e.g., PDI-[G]2 showed a down-field shift, while PDI-[β-A]2 showed a slight up-field shift, respectively. The reason for the
different propensity of NMR peak shifts depending on temperature is
unclear. We believe that the result can provide important information
in terms of solubility behavior in the amino acid-conjugated PDI.
We propose that in PDI-[G]2, high temperature induces segregation
of the aggregated perylene cores, whereas in PDI-[β-A]2, increased temperature leads to solubilization of small-sized π-stacked
molecules, such as dimers, trimers, etc. On the basis of this result,
PDI-[A]2, having good solubility in DMF or DMSO, was chosen
as a PDI derivative for further peptide coupling reactions.

2.2 Optimization for the Synthesis of Peptide-Conjugated
Perylene Diimide (P-PDI)
Bolaamphiphilic PDI peptides were
synthesized by the standard SPPS method with a two-step coupling protocol:
(1) assembling of bioactive peptides on CTC resin followed by (2)
coupling of PDI-[A]2 (Scheme 1b). First, 0.5 equiv of PDI-[A]2 was coupled to the N-terminus of a peptide, which was assembled
on the CTC resin, in DMF overnight at room temperature. Then, the
resin was washed and allowed to undergo further coupling reaction
without extra addition of PDI-[A]2 to induce maximal dimerization.
After acidic cleavage from the resin and trituration with ether, a
peptide-conjugated perylene diimide (P-PDI) bolaamphiphile was obtained.

To explore optimal conditions for synthesizing the P-PDI bolaamphiphile,
various parameters were controlled, including loading levels, reaction
times, and solvents. For the experiment on PDT, we introduced a tripeptide
sequence into PDI as a model peptide ligand, specifically Arg–Gly–Asp
(RGD). RGD is a well-known cell attaching sequence applied in various
biological studies.20−22 First, the coupling and dimerization yields between
PDI-[A]2 and the peptide on the CTC resin were compared
at different reaction times and loading levels (Figure 1). The loading levels were adjusted by controlling
the amount of first amino acid coupled to the CTC resin. DMF was selected
as a solvent due to its high solubility on PDI-[A]2. After
obtaining the RGD peptide-appended PDI from the resin, product yields
were compared using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
A peak at around 10.8 min is the diRGD-appended product, and at around
14.8 min is the monoRGD-appended PDI, confirmed by electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Figures S2 and S3). As shown in Figure 2, the product yields were monitored by HPLC. Most of the coupling
and dimerization reactions were completed within 1 h. As the reaction
time proceeded up to 12 h, the yields from the reaction with 0.1,
0.4, and 0.9 mmol/g of peptide loadings increased to about 66, 70,
and 80%, respectively. As expected, higher peptide loading favored
dimerization, resulting in a higher yield. It can be assumed that
dimerization was directly influenced by the concentration of peptides
on the resin. Thus, it can be concluded that the longer reaction time
and higher peptide loading (>0.9 mmol/g) provided a favorable result
through the symmetric coupling of PDI molecules to the N-terminal
of the RGD-conjugated resin.

Figure 1 Coupling and dimerization yield vs reaction
time depending on the
loading level of the CTC resin (black square: 0.1 mmol/g, red circle:
0.4 mmol/g, blue triangle: 0.9 mmol/g).

Figure 2 (a) UV spectra and (b) fluorescence spectra (λex: 532 nm) of PDI-[ARGD]2 in the DMF–H2O mixture of different ratios.

The solvents can affect the swelling property of the CTC
resin,
and thus DMF and two other mixed solvents (tetrahydrofuran (THF)/DMF
and dichloromethane (DCM)/DMF) were tested. The loading levels and
the reaction times were fixed to 0.9 mmol/g and 1 h, respectively.
Within the system of the tested solvents, there were not much difference
in the product yield. We expected to observe a direct relationship
between the resin swelling and the synthetic efficiency of the P-PDI
bolaamphiphile by controlling the distance between the reaction sites
within the resin matrix.23 As shown in Table 1, although there was
a tendency of increasing dimerization yield with an increase in resin
swelling, swelling did not appear to be a critical factor in this
instance.

2.3 Optical Properties of PDI-[ARGD]2
Currently there is no standard guideline of an optimal
laser source for PDT, and the light sources are usually chosen corresponding
to the absorption peaks of a representative dye, porphyrin.24−26 In porphyrin, the Soret band (400–410 nm) shows the highest
peak, and the Q band appears from 505 to 635 nm. Both bands have their
own pros and cons for PDT, but the longer wavelengths within the Q
bands can penetrate into the skin more deeply.27−29 The Q bands
require a higher energy level, but this weakness could be overcome
in PDI-[ARGD]2. UV–vis spectra of PDI-[ARGD]2 showed three distinct absorption bands at 532, 490, and 460
nm in the DMF–H2O mixture with the highest peak
occurring at 532 nm (Figure 2a). The 532 nm band is within the Q band range, whereby deeper
light penetration using lesser energy is possible with PDI-[ARGD]2. Since the environment where PDT is conducted is an aquatic
condition, the effect of water on the optical properties of PDI-[ARGD]2 should be confirmed. Upon increasing the amount of water,
the absorption peak was shifted to a longer wavelength, and the level
of absorbance was decreased. This result suggests that water can partly
trigger packing of the PDI core.30 Fluorescence
spectra also showed a tendency similar to that of the UV–vis
spectra (Figure 2b).
When the ratio of water increased in the DMF–H2O
mixed solvent, the intensity of the fluorescence peak decreased slightly
and shifted to a longer wavelength. Although slight quenching (21.5%)
of excitons occurred with the stacking of the PDI core, total quenching
could be blocked by the hydrophilic functionalization of PDI. The
result suggests that PDI-[ARGD]2 can be used as an effective
photosensitizer in PDT.

2.4 Singlet Oxygen Generation
(SOG) of PDI-[ARGD]2
Singlet oxygen (1O2) generation
of PDI-[ARGD]2 was estimated by ρ-nitrosodimethylaniline
(RNO) bleaching assay in the presence of histidine.31 The absorbance change of RNO was monitored at 440 nm under
laser irradiation at 532 nm. PDI-[ARGD]2 was well dissolved
in deionized water to produce 1O2 that enabled
RNO bleaching via photochemical oxidation (Figure 3a). Furthermore, the 1O2 generation ability of PDI-[ARGD]2 and PDI-[A]2 was compared based on the derived slopes of RNO absorbance plots
(−ln A440) (Figure 3b).32 As demonstrated, there was no significant influence of the conjugated
amino acids on the 1O2 generation capacity of
PDI. For both compounds, 60 min laser irradiation was enough for the
complete bleaching of RNO. Thus, difference in the cellular uptake
would be the discriminating factor for the successful PDT application.

(532 nm, 200 mW/cm2). (b) Comparison of the RNO absorbance
at 440 nm (−ln A) using PDI-[ARGD]2 and PDI-[A]2.

2.5 Cellular Uptake of PDI-[ARGD]2 and
Cell Viability under Laser Irradiation
First of all, we have
confirmed that PDI-[ARGD]2 is a stable compound in the
physiological environment. Photoluminescent (PL) stability of PDI-[ARGD]2 was well-preserved in a buffer (pH 7.4) containing 25% human
serum for up to 12 h (Figure S6). In addition,
the compound was noncytotoxic to NIH-3T3 cells in the concentration
range of 0.1–100 μM (Figure S7). Since the cellular uptake of a photosensitizer is essential for
an effective PDT treatment, we studied the cellular uptake of PDI-[ARGD]2 by NIH-3T3. As a control, PDI-[A]2 was used which
has no integrin binding moiety. As expected, the fluorescence of PDI
could be clearly observed in the cytoplasm of NIH-3T3 cells when treated
with PDI-[ARGD]2, whereas very weak signals of PDI were
detected in the PDI-[A]2-treated cells (Figure 4). These results support the
fact that the incorporated RGD sequence actively increased the cellular
uptake of PDIs, which could allow more effective PDT.

Figure 4 Confocal microscopy images
of NIH-3T3 cells after the uptake of
PDI-[ARGD]2 (top, 0.1 mM) and PDI-[A]2 (bottom,
0.1 mM) (green: PDI, blue: 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)).

On the basis of the cellular uptake
behavior of the PDIs in NIH-3T3
cells, dark toxicity and phototoxicity of the PDI-[ARGD]2 and PDI-[A]2 were assessed by the CCK-8 assay (Figure 5). After treating
NIH-3T3 cells with PDI-[ARGD]2 or PDI-[A]2 for
2 h, cell viability was measured with or without laser irradiation
under 535 nm. No toxicity was observed in the dark, regardless of
the peptide sequence incorporated into PDIs. However, under laser
irradiation, PDI-[ARGD]2 was demonstrated to be more phototoxic
on the NIH-3T3 cells than PDI-[A]2. Since the cellular
uptake of PDI-[A]2 was hardly observed, only a moderate
level of phototoxicity was observed. However, the phototoxicity of
PDI-[ARGD]2 was evidently stronger owing to its active
targeting ability. Altogether, PDI-[ARGD]2 showed
reasonable cellular uptake and phototoxicity as an effective PDT agent.

and PDI-[A]2 (0.1 mM) against NIH-3T3 cells.
Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer was used as a control. The
error bars indicate the standard deviations based on five samples
per group.

In conclusion, we have developed
an efficient synthetic method
which can provide a P-PDI bolaamphiphile in high yield (80%). By introducing
a spacer amino acid, L-alanine, into PDA in molten
imidazole, the solubility of perylene in organic solvent was improved
greatly. Thus, the rest of the amino acid sequences can be easily
conjugated to PDI-[A]2 via the SPPS method. As a model
peptide sequence, Arg–Gly–Asp (RGD), which can mediate
cell attachment, was chosen for cell target therapy. We found that
the reaction time and the loading level were the critical factors
for obtaining the P-PDI bolaamphiphile in high yield on the CTC resin.
Phototoxic effects of PDI-[ARGD]2 was tested on cells and
was found to exhibit good performance, which suggest that PDI-[ARGD]2 has a great potential in the field of photodynamic therapy.

3 Methods
3.1 Materials and Instrument
All starting
materials for syntheses were purchased and used without further purification.
All reactions were tracked by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with
0.25 mm Merck silica gel plates (60F-254) under UV irradiation (UV-lamp,
254 nm). The NIH-3T3 cell line, fetal bovine serum (FBS), antibiotics
(penicillin–streptomycin), and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. UV–vis absorbance
was measured by using an Optizen 2120 UV (Mecasys, Korea). Fluorescence
images were obtained using an LSM 780 confocal laser scanning microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Germany). For SPPS, a fritted pressure equalizing (PE)
tube (Libra Tube) was used as a reactor, which was shaken by using
an SI-600R shaker (JEIO Tech., Korea). The purity of the synthesized
peptide was analyzed by using an LCQ LC/MS system (Thermo Finnigan).
The silica gel C8-reversed phase (Sigma-Aldrich, 40–63
μm) was used for column chromatography purification. 1H NMR and 13H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance
AVIII-500Q spectrometer in deuterated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-d6, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) with
tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Reverse-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography was performed using an Agilent 1260 Infinity
LC System with a Kromasil C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm). Mass spectra
were recorded using an AB SCIEX 3200 QTRAP LC/MS/MS system combined
with an Agilent HPLC. Elemental analyses were performed using an elemental
analyzer (Elementar Vario EL III, Germany). Fluorescence images were
obtained using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LEICA, Germany).
Absorbances for cell cytotoxicity test were measured using a SpectraMax
M2 (Molecular Devices).

3.2 Synthesis of Amino Acid-Conjugated
Perylene
Diimides (PDIs)
Glycine (2 mmol), L-alanine
(2 mmol), or β-alanine (2 mmol) was mixed with 1 mmol of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic
dianhydride and 2 g of imidazole in a round bottom flask, respectively.
The reaction mixtures were stirred for 30 min at 130 °C under
a nitrogen atmosphere. After 30 min, the temperature was lowered to
90 °C and 5 mL of distilled water (DW) was added. After 10 min,
the resulting red solids were filtered to remove the unreacted starting
materials. Then, 2 M HCl (10 mL) was added to convert the ionized
product into a free acid form. Final products were collected by centrifugation
and washed with DW several times until the supernatant solution became
nonacidic. The collected products were dried in a vacuum oven overnight,
yielding dark red solids (Scheme 1a; glycine (1), 88.2%; L-alanine (2),
91.5%; and β-alanine (3), 89.2%).

3.3 Synthesis
of PDI-[ARGD]2 by the
SPPS Method
Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-Asp(OtBu)-OH
(0.3, 0.6, or 0.9 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine
(DIPEA) (4 equiv) in 10 mL of DMF were introduced into the 2-CTC resin
(1 g, 1.04 mmol/g) and shaken overnight in fritted PE tubes to make
different loading levels. After the reaction, the remaining chloride
groups in the CTC resin were capped by treating with 10 mL MeOH and
DIPEA (4 equiv) for 3 h. The loading level was calculated by Fmoc
titration. To continue the next amino acid couplings, the resin was
treated with 10 mL of 20% piperidine/DMF for 20 min to remove the
Fmoc groups. Then, Fmoc-Gly and Fmoc-Arg(pbf) were sequentially coupled
to the Asp-loaded resin with hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) (2 equiv),
2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) (2 equiv), and DIPEA (4 equiv) in DMF for
3 h, and deprotected with 20% piperidine/DMF for 20 min after each
coupling. The final peptide-coupled resin, H-Arg(pbf)–Gly–Asp(tBu)–CTC
resin, was divided into four groups (200 mg each) to find out optimal
reaction times and loading levels. The resins were coupled to PDI-[A]2 (0.5 equiv) with HOBT (1 equiv), HBTU (1 equiv), and DIPEA
(2 equiv) in DMF for 30 min, 1, 2, 4, and 12 h, respectively. The
resins were washed with DMF, DCM, and MeOH until no fluorescence appeared
from the washing solution. For on-bead dimerization, the same coupling
condition was applied, including HOBT (1 equiv), HBTU (1 equiv), and
DIPEA (1 equiv) in DMF. The dimerization time was the same as in the
previous reaction. The final product was cleaved from the resin by
treating it with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/triisopropylsilane/H2O (95:2.5:2.5) for 1 h and recovered as red solids after trituration
with diethyl ether. The yields and the purities of the products were
compared by HPLC and ESI-MS data. For HPLC analysis, a gradient of
buffer (buffer (A) deionized water containing 0.1% TFA; buffer (B)
acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA) with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min was
applied as an eluent as shown in Table S1. To find out the swelling effect of the resin on synthesis, different
kinds of solvents—DMF and two mixed solvents (THF/DMF and DCM/DMF)
were used for SPPS. The loading level and the coupling reaction time
were fixed at 0.9 mmol/g and 2 h, and the results were also compared.

3.4 Purification of PDI-[ARGD]2 by
Reverse-Phase Silica Gel Column Chromatography
After the
structure of each peak was confirmed through HPLC and ESI-MS, C8-reverse-phase
silica gel column chromatography was applied to purify the final product.
A reverse-phase TLC plate was also used to obtain reasonable Rf values for separation. Under MeCN/0.1% TFA
in a H2O (40:60) solvent system, we could obtain reasonable Rf values of the product (0.44) and the by-product
(0.75), which is a single peptide-conjugated PDI. Before separation,
a silica gel slurry was prepared by distilled MeOH to pack the column.
After loading the sample, the mobile solvent system was added for
separation. Moderate pressure was applied to the column, and two distinct
colors from the products were easily recognized during separation.
The final product obtained by column chromatography (yield, 60%) was
confirmed by ESI-MS, 1H NMR (Figure S4), and 13C NMR (Figure S5).

3.5 Singlet Oxygen Generation
Singlet
oxygen generation (SOG) was estimated by observing a decrease in the
absorbance of the mixed p-nitrosodimethylaniline
(RNO) at 440 nm under 532 nm laser excitation (200 mW/cm2, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Tech. Co., Ltd., China).
The aqueous mixtures for SOG estimation were prepared by mixing 0.21
mL of PDI-[ARGD]2 solutions with 0.11 mL of RNO solution
(0.12 mM), 0.7 mL of histidine solution (0.03 M), and 0.18 mL of water.
Laser excitation at 532 nm was performed by irradiating the collimated
laser beam through the sample. The mixture for SOG estimation was
prepared by the same procedure in the case for PDI-[A]2 as well.

3.6 In Vitro Cellular Uptake
NIH-3T3
cell line was maintained in an RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
10% FBS and 1% antibiotic (penicillin–streptomycin) in a humidified
5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The cells were seeded (5
× 105 cells/well) onto 100 mm dishes with slide glasses
at the bottom and allowed to grow until reaching 70% confluence. After
washing with PBS buffer (pH 7.4) twice, the cells were incubated in
a 7.0 mL of serum-free medium containing PDI-[ARGD]2 and
PDI-[A]2 (each 100 μM) for 2 h. The treated cells
were washed twice with PBS buffer (pH 7.4), fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde
for 5 min and stained with DAPI for 3 min at room temperature. Then,
fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal laser scanning
microscope.

3.7 Cytotoxicity Test
NIH-3T3 cells were
seeded (1 × 104 cells/well) onto 96-well plates and
incubated for 24 h. After replacing the culture medium with 200 μL
of serum-free medium containing 100, 10, 1, and 0.1 μM of PDI-[ARGD]2, the treated cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C.
The cells were washed with fresh medium, and each well was treated
with 20 μL of CCK-8 reagent and incubated for 2 h. Subsequently,
absorbance at 450 nm was measured.

3.8 In Vitro
Dark and Phototoxicity Assay
NIH-3T3 cells were seeded (1
× 104 cells/well) onto
96-well plates and incubated for 24 h. After replacing the culture
medium with 200 μL of serum-free medium containing PDI-[ARGD]2 or PDI-[A]2 (each 1 μM), the treated cells
were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed with fresh
medium and irradiated with laser (535 nm, 200 nW/cm2, each
well for 5 min). Then, the cells were further incubated for another
3 h to assess phototoxicity. For the dark-toxicity test, the cells
were prepared following the same procedure without laser irradiation.
Then, each well was treated with 20 μL of CCK-8 reagent and
incubated for 1 h, and then the absorbance at 450 nm was measured.
