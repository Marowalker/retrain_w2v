==== Body
In the original article I have
presented the stereochemical structures of ApppD, ApppI, and AppD.
Stereochemical structures of the adenosine part of the compounds are
“upside down”, and the real stereochemical structures
are presented here for Figures 2 and 3. Also the solvent used in the
synthesis of ApppD has been presented incorrectly in the original
article in Scheme 1; it is NOT acetonitrile (CH3CN) but dimethylformamide
(DMF).
