Room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs)
are a class of nonaqueous
solvents that have expanded the realm of modern chemistry, drawing
increasing interest over the last few decades, not only in terms of
their own unique physical chemistry but also in many applications
including organic synthesis, electrochemistry, and biological systems,
wherein charged solutes (i.e., electrolytes) often play vital roles.
However, our fundamental understanding of the dissolution of an electrolyte
in an IL is still rather limited. For example, the activity of a charged
species has frequently been assumed to be unity without a clear experimental
basis. In this study, we have discussed a standard component-based
scheme for the dissolution of an electrolyte in an IL, supported by
our observation of ideal Nernstian responses for the reduction of
silver and ferrocenium salts in a representative IL, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([emim+][NTf2–] or [emim+][TFSI–]). Using this scheme, which was also supported by temperature-dependent
measurements with ILs having longer alkyl chains in the imidazolium
ring, and the solubility of the IL in water, we established the concept
of Gibbs transfer energies of “pseudo-single ions” from
the IL to conventional neutral molecular solvents (water, acetonitrile,
and methanol). This concept, which bridges component- and constituent-based
energetics, utilizes an extrathermodynamic assumption, which itself
was justified by experimental observations. These energies enable
us to eliminate inner potential differences between the IL and molecular
solvents (solvent–solvent interactions), that is, on a practical
level, conditional liquid junction potential differences, so that
we can discuss ion–solvent interactions independently. Specifically,
we have examined the standard electrode potential of the ferrocenium/ferrocene
redox couple, Fc+/Fc, and the absolute intrinsic standard
chemical potential of a proton in [emim+][NTf2–], finding that the proton is more acidic in the
IL than in water by 6.5 ± 0.6 units on the unified pH scale.
These results strengthen the progress on the physical chemistry of
ions in IL solvent systems on the basis of their activities, providing
a rigorous thermodynamic framework.

Introduction
Solutions
of electrolytes are ubiquitous in nature and play vital
roles in chemical, biological, and ecological processes. They
are formally defined as a liquid or solid phase containing a substrate
that bears ions (an ionophore, e.g., an ionic crystal such as NaCl)
or one that is capable of producing ions (an ionogen, e.g., an organic
acid that can dissociate into ions) and a substance that dissolves
these species (often a neutral molecular solvent, such as water).
The physical chemistry of such ionically conducting solutions underlies
the entire field of electrochemistry and has been termed “ionics”.1 Although studies on ionics have mainly been performed
in aqueous solutions, which limits the types of substances we can
handle, over the last 100 years nonaqueous solvent systems (e.g.,
molten salts, organic molecular liquids, solid oxides, etc.) have
also been studied, enabling us to handle often unstable species that
have many practical applications, such as Li ion transport in batteries,2 electrodeposition of elements (e.g., Al),3,4 and hydride (H–) transfer5,6 or
conduction.7,8

Ionic liquids (ILs) are one of the
most recent classes of nonaqueous
solvent systems to have been established. An IL is defined as a solvent-free
combination of cations and anions that displays at least one liquid-like
phase below 350 °C, whereas a room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL)
is an IL that exists in a liquid-like phase at 25 °C.9,10 In this article, the ILs that we discuss are all RTILs. ILs can
be described by apparently contradicting concepts: they are electrolytic
solutions in the limiting case of zero molecular solvent, like an
ionic crystal, but being liquid at room-temperature implies the possibility
that they may play the role of a virtually nonvolatile11 electrolytic “solvent”. Accordingly,
ILs are often thought of as the missing link between neutral molecular
solvents and molten salts.12 This concept
has been drawing increasing interest over the past few decades,13−18 with ILs having been found to exhibit interesting and useful properties
of dissolution and solvation not only as solvents for reactions,19−29 but also as reactive solutes,30−32 in which an IL molecule is embedded
(or tagged)33−37 as a part of the solute in neutral molecular solvents. More importantly,
these properties can be finely tailored to meet specific needs by
designing structures of the IL molecule, facilitating a wide range
of chemical transformations and amplifying the importance of the chemistry
of ILs.

In terms of thermodynamics, as ILs are composed of only
an ionophore
as the solvent, representing the limiting case of zero molecular solvent
as a reaction medium, it is possible to define unique standard states
for solutes. These standard states are distinct from those of solutes
in molecular solvents, wherein ideal behavior for the physical properties
of ions can be observed at infinite dilution of an electrolytic solution,
which eliminates long-range and strong electrostatic interactions.
Thus, in terms of describing the kinetic and thermodynamic properties
of (electro)chemical reactions or extractions, what factors must be
considered when an IL is used to dissolve solutes (neutral molecules
or electrolytes) compared to those for a conventional molecular solvent?
This question concerns the solvation of the solutes (solute–solvent
interactions), which is thermodynamically quantified by the Gibbs
energy change upon transfer (Gibbs transfer energy) of a given solute
from a molecular solvent to an IL. A theoretical framework to answer
this question, called the protoelectric potential map, has previously
been constructed by Radtke, Himmel, and Krossing et al.38−40 We will therefore focus briefly on introducing the physical meaning
of the Gibbs transfer energy of a single ion and the current experimental
difficulties associated with the determination of this quantity, especially
when involving an IL as a solvent.

In the case of neutral solute
molecules, the quantification of
solvation can, in principle, be made in a straightforward manner by
measuring the solubility of the solute in two solvents and then taking
the difference. Thus, a number of thermodynamic properties have been
measured in ILs, such as the solubility of gases41 or neutral solutes,42−47 starting from fundamentals like activity and expanding to applications
like the transformation of organic substrates.

However, in the
case of an electrolyte as a solute that produces
ions, the quantification of solvation is accompanied by a complication,
that is, the difference between the electrical potentials of the two
phases has to be considered upon transfer of single ions. The importance
of this is illustrated, for example, by the permselective transfer
of ions across neuronal membranes, eventually invoking an electrical
signal in nerve cells,48 or by the release
of ions from a hydrophobic self-assembled monolayer mimicking biological
molecular recognition on protein surfaces.49

There are two ways to define the Gibbs transfer energy of
a single
ion: “real” and “intrinsic” energies.
This is caused by the formalism of the electrochemical potential for
an ionic species.50−52,38 Thus, when an electrochemical
potential difference (Δμ̃) is expressed by three
potential differences, i.e., chemical (Δμ), surface (Δχ),
and outer (Δψ) (eq 1, where z is the charge of the species, and F is the Faraday constant), two new types of potential differences
can be defined:50−52,38 (1) the real chemical
potential difference,53−55 Δα = Δμ + zFΔχ (eq 2), and (2) the inner potential difference, Δϕ = Δχ
+ Δψ (eq 3), where Δμ is generally called the intrinsic chemical
potential difference.56−58 Note that both the real (Δα) and the
intrinsic (Δμ) chemical potential differences are differences
of absolute quantities. The former can be directly measured through
a determination of the outer potential difference (Δψ),
whereas the latter cannot because the inner potential difference (Δϕ)
cannot be directly determined. For example, an attempt to compare
the potentials for the electrode reaction in which Ag+ is
reduced to Ag metal in two different solvents would fail when determining
the intrinsic Gibbs transfer energy of Ag+ from one solvent
to the other. This is because, upon physical contact of the two different
solvents, the difference in chemical potentials of the two solvents
yields an inner potential difference50 that
manifests itself on a practical level as a conditional liquid junction
potential difference,59,58 involving the presence of a spectator
electrolyte. However, whereas the real chemical potential difference
(Δα) results from a mixture of two physically quite different
effects (solvation in the bulk and surface properties of the bulk
received by an ion transferring from just outside of the bulk to the
interior part as measured in, for example, a jet (Kenrick) cell60), the intrinsic chemical potential difference
(Δμ) exclusively characterizes differences in ion–solvent
interactions in the two bulk solutions. 1   2   3  For ionics in molecular solvents, as the solubility
of a given electrolyte has to be measured in a manner similar to that
for neutral molecules, which affords the intrinsic§ Gibbs transfer energy of the whole salt, methods have been
devised to divide the intrinsic Gibbs transfer energy of the electrolyte
into contributions from its two constituent ions, that is, extrathermodynamic
assumptions have been sought61−66 and established over the last several decades. Only
the so-called reference electrolyte assumption67,68 using tetraphenylarsonium tetraphenylborate (TA+TB–) or tetraphenylphosphonium tetraphenylborate (TP+TB–), otherwise known as the “TATB
assumption” or “TPTB assumption”, respectively,
and discussed in more detail later (see Scheme 1 for structures), has been found to afford
reasonable intrinsic Gibbs transfer energies of single ions, which
are supported by recent theoretical ab initio calculations using the
cluster-pair approximation.⊥

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures
of TA+, TP+, and TB–
Meanwhile, although some progress
has been made in the field of
ionics in ILs, it is still not fully developed. For example, the electrode
potential of the redox couple between protons and dihydrogen gas,69−71 acidity,72−80 correlations between acidities in ILs and those in molecular solvents,79,81,82 studies of reference electrodes
(wherein negligible liquid junction potential (NLJP) difference is
frequently assumed),83−87 interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES)
for charge-transfer processes,88−91 and three-phase electrodes using droplets92 were reported. However, almost all of these
measurements are formal concentration-based and not activity-based.
Although thermodynamic measurements on mixing behaviors93−98,47 and vapor pressures11,99−102 of ILs have been reported, no thermodynamic behavior for any electroactive
electrolyte has been reported. Comparing acidities in ILs and molecular
solvents may yield an opportunity to estimate the intrinsic transfer
energy of H+ to an IL from a molecular solvent (e.g., water,81 acetonitrile,79 or
dimethylsulfoxide82). Unfortunately though,
there is a critical problem, as it first requires an estimation of
the intrinsic transfer energy of the conjugate acid or base on the
basis of the acidities of these charged species. These issues indicate
that there is no basis to even attempt to quantify the intrinsic transfer
energy of a single ion to an IL from a molecular solvent by applying
the TATB or TPTB assumption. Although ITIES studies are activity-based,
the nonpolarizable character of the interface makes interpretation
of the acquired quantities quite complex, except in a few cases in
which quite hydrophobic ILs are used.103−106

In this article, we initially
discuss the mass action law and standard
states for ionic solutes in ILs. We then confirm our postulations
by potential difference measurements of electrochemical cells using
silver and ferrocenium salts as typical probe electrolytes in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([emim+][NTf2–] or [emim+][TFSI–]; Scheme 2) at 25
± 1 °C as a representative IL, which was previously found
not to exhibit nanoscale ordering or aggregation of the alkyl chains
in nonpolar domains.107−109 We also measured the potential differences
at higher temperatures for cells containing the NTf2– salts of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium and 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium
(bmim+ and omim+, respectively; Scheme 2). These measurements resulted
in a successful determination of the reaction stoichiometry of electrode
reactions involving these salts, their activity coefficients, and
the standard electrode potential for the reduction of Ag+ to Ag metal in [emim+][NTf2–]. We have also assembled a continuum explanation for solvation by
conventional molecular solvents and ILs by means of solubility measurements
and the introduction of the new concept of “pseudo-single ions”
under the scheme of the TATB or TPTB assumption to analyze intrinsic
solvation parameters for several interesting electrolytes, thermodynamically
highlighting solvation by [emim+][NTf2–]. On the basis of these two observations, we now have a thermodynamic
basis for ionics in ILs. For example, on the basis of activity, we
show the possibility to connect a pH scale in an IL to a unified pH
scale110 previously developed for all phases.
This was achieved by taking down thermodynamic and nonthermodynamic
fences (i.e., conditional liquid junction potential differences) between
conventional molecular solvents and [emim+][NTf2–]. Our experimental results not only provide a
thermodynamic basis for ionics in ILs but also, for the first
time, a thermodynamic “bridge” to ionics in
conventional molecular solvents on the basis of evidence obtained
from activity measurements.

Results and Discussion
Energetics upon Dissolution of an Electrolyte
into an IL: Application
of the Mass Action Law
As an IL represents the limiting case
of zero neutral molecular solvent, when the dissolution of a salt,
A+X–, into an IL, [B+][X–], which has an anion in common with the salt, is considered,
the mass action law as it applies to neutral molecular solvents (eq 4a) is not applicable because
each ion is still adjacent to oppositely charged ions, even after
infinite dilution of the solution by the IL. This allows us to deduce
that the dissolution has to be described by A+X– becoming a component of the IL (eq 4b, where μ is the intrinsic chemical potential,
and x is the mole fraction of [A+][X–]) rather than by solvation of the individual constituent
ions of A+X– (i.e., A+ and
X–). 4a   4b   4c  Alternatively, it is still possible to describe
the thermodynamics of the dissolution by a dissociation energy that
determines the concentration of “free” ions in the IL
as an aggregate of ion-pairs (the so-called constituent-based approach).
This energy is defined by treating the IL as a traditional dilute
electrolyte solution111−113 or a concentrated electrolyte solution,114−116 both of which models have been discussed as a central matter in
the ionics of ILs.117 Although these solution
models are attractive to explain our results described later, the
dissociation energy is still under debate, and the results in our
study cannot determine the energy because, provided it is observable,
it would be expected to be constant, resulting in a parallel shift
of solubility product constants and standard electrode potentials.

Therefore, a component-based approach, which we have adopted, is
important when a thermodynamic quantity is considered, as previously
discussed by Krossing et al.39 For example,
for the determination of the acidity of a given compound (A+X– is H+X– in this
case) on an absolute scale in an IL, the acidity of the proton has
to be based on the compound being a component of the IL in the IL
solution. Rogers et al.,98 Welton et al.,97 and Doherty et al.73 also pointed this issue out. Krossing et al.39 discussed the effects of the formation of the homoconjugate
(HX2–) on acidity in IL solutions. Even
for a salt, A+Y–, that does not have
an anion in common with the IL, [B+][X–], the chemical potential of A+Y– in
[B+][X–] will be the sum of that of [A+][X–] and [B+][Y–] at infinite dilution (eq 4c, where x is the mole fraction of [A+][Y–]), assuming the absence of a preferential
interaction between A+ and Y–. This assumption
is not just applicable to a single, special case. For example, the
absorptivity of the Kosower salt (which is an iodide salt of a pyridinium
that exhibits absorption only when its ions are ion-paired) in ILs
consisting of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (bmim+) as a
common cation indicates that ILs and the salt apparently form only
statistically random ion contacts.118 pKa measurements of a series of ylide salts with
different counteranions also confirmed no effect of the anions on
the respective pKa’s.82 Meanwhile, the chemical potential of [B+][X–] is defined as the sum of the chemical
potentials of [B+] and [X–] because [B+] and [X–] are constituents of the solvent.
At infinite dilution (or pure [B+][X–]) this will yield eq 4d, which was successfully used to assess the Gibbs energy of fusion
for ILs from the solid to the liquid state, which is relevant to the
melting point of an IL,119 and is evaluated
in relation to vaporization, lattice formation, and dissociation processes
of ILs.120 4d  This results in a significant
difference between
the solvation of an electrolyte by an IL and by a molecular solvent,
in terms of a Born–Fajans–Haber cycle as proposed in Figure 1. In the thermodynamic
cycle for solvation by a molecular solvent (Figure 1a), a solid electrolyte forms two separate
ions in the gas phase, which are then solvated by solvent molecules.
When the dielectric permittivity of the solvent is low, these exist
largely as ion pairs in the form of an associated salt, with an association
constant symbolized by KA. The solubility
product constant, Ksp, of the electrolyte
is defined as the solubility product when solute–solute interactions
are eliminated by infinite dilution.

Figure 1 Born–Fajans–Haber cycles
for the assessment of the
solubility product constant, Ksp, of an
electrolyte (denoted as “filled circled plus, filled circled
minus”) to two different types of solvents: (a) a neutral molecular
solvent; and (b) an IL, wherein the ionic solvent molecule is denoted
as “open circled plus, open circled minus”. Subscripts
(s), (g), (sol), and (IL) for each ion or pair of ions indicate the
electrolyte or its ionic constituents in the solid phase, gas phase,
solvated by neutral solvent molecules, and solvated by the IL, respectively.

Meanwhile, for solvation in an
IL (Figure 1b), the
two constituent ions of the electrolyte
become an integral part of the IL to yield two additional IL components.
Note that the stoichiometric number (n) of ionic
constituents of an IL involved in the reaction depends on the nature
of the electrolyte, which has to be determined experimentally. For
example, in the case of salts of transition metal cations forming
complexes with multiple anions of ILs upon dissolution,121−123 the corresponding residual cations are supposed to be in the stoichiometry
required for electroneutrality. This situation is completely different
from that in a molecular solvent because the electrolyte exists as
two IL components (not two individually solvated constituents), even
at infinite dilution in the IL (eq 5, where “s” and “IL” in
subscript denote a substance in the solid phase and solvated by an
IL, respectively, and the activities are in the molarity scale unless
otherwise noted by a subscript “x”,
indicating them being in the mole fraction scale). On the basis of
the mass action law as shown in Figure 1b, the solubility product constant, Ksp, is defined as the solubility product when interactions
between the two solute ions (not solute and solvent
ions) are eliminated by infinite dilution as shown in eq 6, where γ, γs, and γIL are the activity coefficients of solutes,
the solid electrolyte, and the IL, respectively, C is the concentration [mol/L], xs and xIL are the mole fractions of the solid electrolyte
and the IL, respectively, μi°,IL is the standard chemical
potential of the solute, i (e.g., ), in the IL, μj°,s is the standard chemical potential of the solid electrolyte, j (), in the solid phase, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature of the solution. In the case of a salt
that has an ion in common with one of those of the IL as a solvent, eqs 5′ and 6′ define the solubility constant, Ks,
instead (the notation used is the same as that for eqs 5 and 6). 5   6   5′   6′  The solvation scheme for an electrolyte in
an IL as proposed by us in Figure 1b might be too simple to describe thermodynamic quantities
relevant to a particular phenomenon, for example, the dissolution
of an electrolyte in this study, as it is based on a limited, although
still increasing, number of experimental observations in ILs. However,
as described below, we found experimentally that this scheme works
quite effectively to explain potential differences at various temperatures
developed by the dissolution of both silver and ferrocenium salts
to ILs that have different lengths of alkyl chain in the cationic
constituent of the ILs, forming nonpolar domains with nanoscale ordering
when the chain is longer that propyl.107−109 Therefore, our observations
allowed us to determine the stoichiometric number (n in eqs 5 and 6) of ionic constituents of ILs involved in the dissolution,
as well as activity coefficients (γ in eq 6) of each component under this solvation scheme,
resulting in the determination of solubility product constants, pKsp, in an IL, which are used for the experimental
assessment of the absolute intrinsic standard chemical potential of
H+ in an IL in the last section of the paper.

Potential Difference
Measurements Using Silver and Ferrocenium
Salts as Probes To Investigate Activity Coefficients and Reaction
Stoichiometries
To obtain
insight into the reaction stoichiometry and the activity of a salt
dissolved in [emim+][NTf2–] as a representative IL, we measured the potential differences of
electrochemical cells (Cells 1a and 1b∥ where the liquid junction was formed
by a Vycor glass frit,¶ and c1 or c2 are the concentrations
of solutes that were varied) using the Ag+ and ferrocenium
(Fc+) salts of NTf2– as probes
in the IL and found an interesting medium effect. 1a   1b  AgNTf2 is found to form emim+Ag(NTf2)2– upon dissolution
in [emim+][NTf2–],123 and therefore the electrode reaction of interest
and the potential (E) can be described by eqs 7a and 8 as an application of eqs 5′ and 6′, respectively, according
to the Nernst equation, where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature (298.15 K), F is the
Faraday constant, xIL is the mole fraction
of the IL, for which the activity coefficient was assumed to be unity,
and n is the stoichiometric number of ionic constituents
of the IL involved in the electrode reaction. Figure 2a shows the dependence of the electrochemical
potential of a Ag+/Ag electrode configured as in Cell 1a on a function of the concentration of [emim+][Ag(NTf2)2–] as a
solute and the mole fraction of the IL as a solvent, as indicated
in eq 8. The observed
potentials have been converted so as to refer to E°(Fc+/Fc) in [emim+][NTf2–] determined by cyclic voltammetry (see the Experimental Section for details). The observation
of a Nernstian response of the potential to the logarithmic term in eq 8 (the slope was found
to be 100% of the theoretical coefficient only when n is set to 2) clearly indicates that the activity coefficient (γ)
of [emim+][Ag(NTf2)2–] is constant over a wide range (10–5–10–1 M) of analytical concentrations of Ag+NTf2– in [emim+][NTf2–]. From the observed linear relationship
over this concentration range, we extrapolate a value of unity at
the limit of a dilute solution (eq 4c) for the constant activity coefficient of the silver
cation in [emim+][NTf2–].
Accordingly, the standard electrode potential (E°)
of eq 7a was determined
for the first time to be 515 ± 8 mV versus E°(Fc+/Fc) in [emim+][NTf2–] at 25 ± 1 °C by eq 9, formally defining the activity of the silver
cation on the basis of eq 8. Importantly, eq 9 indicates that the potential difference is determined by
the ratio of analytical concentrations of the silver salt to the IL,
strongly supporting our solvation scheme. Equation 7a also implies that, in a region of low analytical
concentration of the silver salt, the activity of Ag+ can
be approximated to the analytical concentration. In fact, Abbott et
al.124 observed such a relationship for
the Ag/AgCl electrode in [emim+][Cl–].
Although the range of concentrations tested was half that in our investigations,
their observation strongly supports the generality of ours. 7a   7b   8   9  Although the observation of an activity
coefficient
of unity for the silver salt in [emim+][NTf2–] supports our solvation scheme, it is not sufficient
proof because even a reaction not involving [emim+] in
the stoichiometry (eq 7b) could yield an equation of the type shown in eq 8, and the stoichiometric number might happen
to be 2. We therefore also measured the electrode potential developed
by the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) redox couple to test
whether Fc+ is coupled with [NTf2–] in the electrode reaction, as stated in eq 10, for which the potential is defined by eq 11, where “(IL)”
and “(IL, x)” in subscripts denote
a substance solvated by the IL, and the activities are in molarity
units and mole fraction units, respectively. Note that the mole fraction
with the stoichiometric number of the IL is involved in the denominator
in the logarithmic term. Figure 2b shows potentials of the Fc+/Fc redox couple
measured by using Cell 1b when the ratio of C([Fc+][NTf2–])
to C(Fc) was varied at 25 ± 1 °C and then
converted so as to refer to E°(Fc+/Fc) in [emim+][NTf2–] determined
by cyclic voltammetry (see the Experimental Section for details). In this measurement, we observed an ideal Nernstian
slope of the potential to the logarithmic term in eq 11 (we found that the slope is 100%
of the theoretical coefficient only when setting the stoichiometric
number to 1), indicating that the activity coefficient of [Fc+][NTf2–] in [emim+][NTf2–] is a constant that is set to
unity over a wide range (10–4–100 M) of analytical concentrations of Fc+NTf2– on the basis of the same argument as above for
the silver cation (eq 12). The intercept being close to zero (1 ± 1 mV) is consistent
with E°(Fc+/Fc) in [emim+][NTf2–] determined by cyclic voltammetry.
We also found such an ideal Nernstian response passing through the
origin at 39 ± 1 °C (see the Supporting Information). As Fc+ is a more bulky cation than
emim+ and the observed stoichiometric number is again the
same as it is expected to be according to eqs 6′ and 10, this observation
justifies our solvation scheme, and the solubility product constant, Ksp, and the solubility constant, Ks, are thus defined by eqs 6 and 6′, respectively, wherein
all of the activity coefficients can be set to unity. 10   11   12  An activity coefficient of unity for the mole
fraction of the IL indicates that the IL solution behaves as an ideal
solution, the properties of which are determined by the number of
particles in the solution. This is unlikely to be applicable for other
ILs having longer alkyl chains in the imidazolium ring, for example,
the NTf2– salts of bmim+ and
omim+ (Scheme 2), which are found to exhibit nanoscale ordering of the alkyl
chains in nonpolar domains.107−109 In fact, we found only about
97 and 93% of the theoretical Nernstian responses in a similar experiment
to Figure 2b except
using [bmim+][NTf2–] and [omim+][NTf2–], respectively, as the
IL at 25 ± 1 °C (see the Supporting Information). However, it has been shown that the extent of
this ordering is strongly dependent on temperature,108 and indeed we found that we were able to recover ideal
Nernstian responses (100% of the theoretical coefficient) at 39 ±
1 and 67 ± 1 °C for [bmim+][NTf2–] and [omim+][NTf2–], respectively (see the Supporting Information). It is noteworthy that these deviations are not caused by nonideal
excess molar volumes of mixtures of these ILs and ferrocenium, similar
to those observed by Lopes and Rebelo et al.93 who tested mixtures of 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazoliums, because values
of the functions of concentrations in the abscissa axes do not depend
on the actual volumes of the solutions. Therefore, these observations
merit future studies to investigate the colligative properties of
various IL solutions.

electrode
and (b) an Fc+/Fc redox couple at a Pt electrode in an
IL ([emim+][NTf2–]) on functions
of the concentrations of (a) Ag+NTf2– and (b) Fc+NTf2– in the
IL at 25 ± 1 °C under an N2 atmosphere in the
dark. The dependence when a sintered glass frit with a porosity of
5 μm was used in the cell instead of a Vycor frit is shown by
white squares (□). The red lines indicate linear correlations
between the potentials and the functions, that is, (a) ln(C([emim+][Ag(NTf2)2–])/xIL2) and
(b) ln(C([Fc+][NTf2–])/(C(Fc) × xIL), where C = concentration [mol/L], acquired by
a linear least-squares fitting method. The potentials were measured
in two different batches of the IL vs an Ag+/Ag electrode
in the IL (C0(Ag+NTf2–) is ca. 1 mM) and then converted to values vs
the standard electrode potential of Fc+/Fc in the IL, which
was determined by the method described in the Experimental
Section.

Evaluation of the Gibbs
Transfer Energies of “Pseudo-Single
Ions” from an IL
Our confirmation that the activity
coefficients of the silver salt and the ferrocenium salt in [emim+][NTf2–] are unity prompted us
to evaluate the Gibbs transfer energies of ions on the basis of the
reference electrolyte assumption,61−66 using TP+TB–. As discussed in the Introduction, it is thermodynamically impossible
to access single-ion properties such as the transfer energy of a single
ion. However, the salt TP+TB– (or TA+TB–) possesses two important properties
for measurements of the Gibbs transfer energy of ions: (1) oppositely
charged ions having the same symmetrical shape, and (2) a large steric
hindrance that buries the charge of the ion.125 On the basis of these properties, the degree of (de)stabilization
experienced by TP+ (or TA+) upon solvation by
a solvent is assumed to be identical to that of TB–. 13a  The Gibbs energy change for the transfer of
TP+TB– from one solvent (sol 1 denoted
in subscript) to another solvent (sol 2 denoted in subscript) (eq 13a) can be thermodynamically
determined from the difference between the logarithms of the solubility
product constants measured in the two solvents, as shown in eq 13b, where pKsp = −log(Ksp). When
the Gibbs transfer energies of the two single ions are defined as
shown in eqs 13c and 13d, the transfer energy of the salt can be expressed
as the sum of the transfer energies of the two single ions (eq 13e). Herein, the TPTB
(and also the TATB) extrathermodynamic assumption states that the
Gibbs transfer energy of the salt, TP+TB– (or TA+TB–), from sol 1 to sol 2 receives
equal contributions from the transfer energies of the TP+ (or TA+) and TB– constituent ions (eq 14). This enables us
to estimate the transfer energies of single TP+ (or TA+) and TB– ions, which has been tested and
found to be valid quantitatively, with an uncertainty of ±3 kJ/mol
in the energy.67 13b   13c   13d   13e   14  Once the Gibbs transfer energies of the TP+ and TB– constituents are determined by eq 14, the transfer energy
of any given ion can be derived by subtracting the Gibbs transfer
energy of TP+ (or TB–) from the Gibbs
transfer energy of a TP+ (or TB–) salt
of that ion. Although a difficulty one might encounter is the low
solubility of this bulky salt (TP+TB–) in molecular solvents, fortunately, we found that the solubility
of the salt is 3.4 mM in [emim+][NTf2–] at 25 °C, which is bracketed by 1.4 mM in acetonitrile63 and 7 mM (for TA+TB–) in DMSO.62 We also found that the solubility
of a neutral bulky molecule, tetraphenylmethane (TM) in [emim+][NTf2–] is 0.4 mM, which is
bracketed by 0.1 mM in methanol126 and
0.6 mM in acetonitrile,126 indicating the
interesting dissolving ability of [emim+][NTf2–].

In the case of an IL as a solvent, for
example, [emim+][NTf2–], the
above assumption using TP+TB– cannot
be applied directly for the determination of the transfer energy of
an ion from the IL to a molecular solvent because, under our component-based
scheme for solvation by the IL, dissolution of the salt, TP+TB–, into the IL will yield two new IL components,
that is, [TP+][NTf2–] and
[emim+][TB–] solvated by the IL (eq 15a), also supported by
a pure entropic mixing behavior of TP+ and TB– in the IL (see the Supporting Information for calorimetric measurements), where pKsp was calculated to be 4.94, as shown in Table 1. 15a

k In the case when an electrolyte

However, an estimation of the Gibbs
transfer energies of single
ions is possible if the transfer reactions of so-called pseudo-single
ions are defined as shown in eqs 15b and 15c, 15b   15c  which are analogous to eqs 13c and 13d, but bridge
component- and constituent-based energetics. This definition is based
on an assumption that the difference in the solvation energies of
TP+NTf2– and emim+TB– by the IL is invoked by the presence of counterions,
that is, NTf2– and emim+,
respectively. Therefore, elimination of the presence of NTf2– and emim+ from TP+NTf2– and emim+TB–, respectively, affords the net solvation energies
of TP+ and TB–, the magnitudes of which
are assumed to be the same. Here, we define a combination of ions,
for example, in the left-hand side of eq 15b, as a “pseudo-single ion”
because this combination represents TP+ stoichiometrically
(see the Supporting Information for a rigorous
derivation of the transfer energies of pseudo-single ions). Thus,
the transfer energies of these two pseudo-single ions are calculated
to be 11.7 kJ/mol for eqs 15b and 15c when “sol” is
methanol by using the pKsp of TP+TB– in methanol (Table 1). In a similar manner, the transfer energies
from the IL to water are calculated to both be 34.8 kJ/mol (Table 2). Only a few transfer
energies of TP+ and TB– have been reported
so far,103−106 for example, in ITIES studies of ion transfer, at an interface between
water and tetraalkylammonium (or tetraalkylphosphonium) tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borates,
which are quite hydrophobic (their pKsp to water was estimated to be <14). Our values compare well with
these reported values. More importantly, our classical method does
not depend on whether a given IL is miscible with a molecular solvent
or not.

b in Table 1, where
the association constant was assumed to be 20 M–1, as reported133 for similar electrolytes.

For completeness, we can now
calculate Gibbs transfer energies
of emim+ and NTf2– as single
ions from the IL to methanol (denoted as “M”), as shown
in eqs 15d and 15e, respectively. 15d   15e  For example, the transfer energy
for emim+ is calculated to be +9.8 kJ/mol from eq 15f, where values were
taken from Tables 1 and 2. The energy for NTf2– is calculated
to be −2.4 kJ/mol in the same manner. The value for emim+ may at first appear to be unusual because, in the Born equation
in which an ion is more stabilized by a solvent as a dielectric body
of which the permittivity is higher, emim+ can be expected
to be stabilized more by methanol (εr = 32.6) than
by [emim+][NTf2–] (εr = 12.3). However, note that the Gibbs energy of formation
of [emim+] in [emim+][NTf2–] contains a contribution from the IL. 15f  To verify the above procedure, we tested the
transfer energies of emim+ and NTf2– from the IL to methanol by calculation of the Gibbs energy change
of dissolution of the IL to water, that is, the solubility of the
IL in water (pKsp). This can be considered
to be a transfer energy of the salt, emim+NTf2–, from the IL, where [emim+][NTf2–] exists in the IL, to water, where emim+ and NTf2– exist as individual
solvated ions (eq 15g). 15g  On the basis of the thermodynamic cycle shown
in Scheme 3 with Gibbs
transfer energies of emim+ from the IL to methanol, followed
by water, and NTf2– from the IL to methanol,
followed by aqueous ethanol and then water, as shown in Table 2, the Gibbs energy change is
calculated to be 15.5 ± 3.0 kJ/mol, which is in perfect agreement
with the value (16.2 ± 0.5 kJ/mol)127 obtained from the pKsp value in Table 1 directly determined
by solubility measurements. This confirms that our solvation scheme
in Figure 1b is appropriate
to describe the medium effect by [emim+][NTf2–], and it enables us to thermodynamically compare
solvation by various solvents, now including ILs. In a similar manner,
we also estimated the Gibbs transfer energy of Ag+ from
the IL to various neutral molecular solvents through the solubility
product constants of Ag+TB– determined
by potentiometric titrations, as shown in Tables 1 and 2 (see the Supporting Information for details).

Error in the Gibbs Transfer
Energy of a “Pseudo-Single
Ion” Caused by the TATB Assumption
In molecular solvents,
the uncertainty (in both precision and accuracy) of the Gibbs transfer
energy of a single ion is thought to be ±3 kJ/mol67 as long as the value is derived from reliable
experimental data of solubilities and a reliable reference electrolyte
assumption, that is, the TATB assumption.

As the TATB assumption
in an IL has been applied in this study, for the first time, with a pseudo-single ion, we have evaluated both its precision
(self-consistency) and its accuracy (correctness). Testing the transfer
energy of emim+ and NTf2– by
the experimental solubility of the IL to water is a good method to
show the high precision of the TATB assumption in the IL with the
pseudo-single ion, treating a series of solubilities of relevant salts.
Another good example is, as evaluated later, an excellent agreement
of the transfer energy of H+ from water to acetonitrile
(45.6 kJ/mol; see Table 2), which was derived by using the TATB assumption in the IL with
the pseudo-single ion, with that determined previously (46 kJ/mol;62 see Table 2). Unfortunately though, these tests cannot determine
the accuracy of the transfer energy of a pseudo-single ion because
the former is only related to the transfers of salts (not single ions),
and the latter just shows consistency in a series of calculations
of conditional liquid junction potential differences.

Theoretically,
the absolute accuracy of the TATB assumption cannot
be clarified by any experimental thermodynamic method. Thus, we chemically
deduced whether the concept of the TATB assumption, that is, that
the magnitude of solvation for the bulky and symmetrically shaped
cation and anion (i.e., TA+, TP+, and TB–) is the same, can prevail in [emim+][NTf2–] by making a comparison between TATB and
another pair of bulky and symmetrically shaped ions (Scheme 4), that is, tetrabutylammonium
(Bu4N+) and tetrabutylborate (Bu4B–), in terms of the relative accuracy. We found
that Bu4N+Bu4B– can work as a reference electrolyte because the Gibbs transfer energies
of both Bu4N+ and Bu4B– from methanol to acetonitrile have almost the same magnitudes as
those for TP+ and TB–, as shown in Table 2. This result is not
surprising as Bu4N+ is found to sometimes show
a similar magnitude of solvation to that for TA+. The IL
consists of two different bulky ionic molecules, that is, emim+ and NTf2–, and these ionic constituents
have the potential to interact with the alkyl group-containing Bu4N+Bu4B– salt in a
chemically different manner from the interaction with the TATB salt
that comprises only aryl groups. Nevertheless, quite interestingly,
we found that the Gibbs transfer energies of Bu4N+ and Bu4B– from the IL to methanol show
similar magnitudes to those for TP+ and TB–. This strongly indicates that the TATB assumption can be applied
for [emim+][NTf2–] as long
as the TATB assumption in conventional molecular solvents is effective.
Therefore, we conclude that the uncertainty of the transfer energy
of a pseudo-single ion in an IL is the same as that for a single ion
in molecular solvents, that is, ±3 kJ/mol.67

Scheme 4 Chemical Structures of Bu4N+ and Bu4B–
Estimation of Conditional Liquid Junction
Potential Differences
On the basis of the observations described
above, we can now evaluate
conditional or practical liquid junction potential differences (ΔLJE) at interfaces between [emim+][NTf2–] and conventional molecular
solvents, including water. In principle, there are two methods to
evaluate ΔLJE: (1) the Izutsu three-component
method,59,134 which enables us to quantify each component
(diffusion and Gibbs transfer energies of charged species, and solvent–solvent
interactions); and (2) a method135 that
takes the difference between an experimental potential difference
of two Ag+/Ag electrodes and a potential difference estimated
by a Gibbs transfer energy of Ag+. Although the latter
method has a disadvantage in that it yields only conditional values,
this is still useful as long as the same conditions are used throughout
the experiments. In this study, we used the latter method to evaluate
ΔLJE caused by diffusion of Et4N+ClO4–, which is
used as a typical supporting electrolyte for molecular solvents in
electrochemistry.

To estimate ΔLJE, the electrochemical cells shown in Cells 2a and 2b (“IL” denotes [emim+][NTf2–], “sol”
denotes methanol or acetonitrile as a solvent in Cell 2a, and “aq” denotes water as a solvent in Cell 2b)∥ were constructed, where
the liquid junction was formed by a Vycor glass frit.# The potential differences of the cells (ECell 2a and ECell 2b) were measured as −152 ± 10 and −431 ± 5
mV at 25 ± 1 °C for Cell 2a where “sol”
was methanol and acetonitrile, respectively, and −596 ±
5 mV at 25 ± 1 °C for Cell 2b. 2a   2b  These potential differences are composed
of three terms: the difference in activities of Ag+ in
the IL and molecular solvent, the Gibbs transfer energy of Ag+ from the IL to the molecular solvent, and ΔLJE that is in question. Thus, as the first and second
terms are known, the conditional liquid junction potential differences
were calculated to be −123 ± 33 and −78 ±
32 mV from the IL to the methanol and acetonitrile solutions used
in Cell 2a, respectively, and −74 ±
32 mV from the IL to the aqueous solution used in Cell 2b (see the Supporting Information for details). These liquid junction potential differences clearly
indicate that the assumption of an NLJP difference between [emim+][NTf2–] and a molecular solvent
cannot be recommended to be used with methanol, acetonitrile, or water
as a solvent. In other words, these potential differences have to
be taken into account.

Assessment of (Electrode) Potentials in an
IL in Comparison
with Molecular Solvents
The elimination of conditional liquid
junction potential differences formed at interfaces between an IL
and a conventional molecular solvent now enables us to assess the
thermodynamic basis of electrochemistry using ILs and to bridge the
realms of conventional molecular solvents and ILs. Here we discuss
(1) the electrode potential of the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) redox couple in [emim+][NTf2–], and (2) the absolute intrinsic standard chemical potential of
H+ in [emim+][NTf2–] derived from the standard Gibbs transfer energy of a proton from
[emim+][NTf2–] to molecular
solvents including water.

The Ferrocenium/Ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) Redox Couple
The electrode potential of the Fc+/Fc couple is recommended
to be used in nonaqueous solvents for the purpose of an internal potential
standard. This electrode potential has also been used for making comparisons
of potentials measured in different solvents under the assumption
that the electrode potential of the Fc+/Fc couple is invariant
with solvent type, as long as the solvent dielectric permittivities
are similar. This is often referred to as the “Fc assumption”,
or more generally this is one of the “reference couple assumptions”.67 Recent electrocatalysis studies136−138 using ILs have also used the Fc+/Fc couple to assess
their potentials in comparison to those in conventional molecular
solvents. However, no estimation of conditional liquid junction potential
differences has been made so far. Therefore, we have tested the Fc
assumption in [emim+][NTf2–] as a typical IL.

When an electrochemical cell as shown in
Cell 3a was constructed, in which the liquid
junction was formed by a Vycor glass frit□ and
the left-hand side of the cell worked as a Ag+/Ag reference
electrode in acetonitrile for cyclic voltammetry, the half-wave electrode
potential of Fc+/Fc in [emim+][NTf2–] was measured as +36 ± 5 mV at 25 ±
1 °C versus the Ag+/Ag reference electrode. Under
our scheme for solvation by an IL ([emim+][NTf2–] here), the electrode reaction occurring on a
glassy carbon disc as the working electrode (denoted as “GC”)
is represented by [Fc+][NTf2–](IL) + e– → Fc(IL) + [NTf2–](IL, x) as depicted in Figure 2b and eq 10, and the half-wave potential, E1/2,
of Fc+/Fc measured by cyclic voltammetry is equal to eq 16, where the first term
is the standard electrode potential. As the mole fraction can be approximated
to unity 16  under the conditions of cyclic voltammetry,
the standard electrode potential (but with the junction potential
difference) is then calculated to be +32 ± 5 mV by subtraction
of the diffusion term in the IL, (RT/2F) ln(DFc/DFc+), where DFc/DFc+ is found to be 1.37.139 According to eq 17 and Scheme S3 (see the Supporting Information), the addition of ΔLJE to this
half-wave potential yields −46 ± 33 mV as the standard
electrode potential of the Fc+/Fc couple in [emim+][NTf2–] without being biased by ΔLJE at the liquid junction as depicted in
Cell 3b. Meanwhile, the half-wave potential
of Fc+/Fc in acetonitrile was measured as +78 ± 5
mV at 25 ± 1 °C versus the same Ag+/Ag reference
electrode by using Cell 4 in which no liquid
junction is formed. The formal electrode potential (at I = 0.10 M) is calculated to be +78 ± 5 mV by subtraction of
the diffusion term in acetonitrile, (RT/2F) ln(DFc/DFc+), where DFc/DFc+ is found to be 1.03.140 This potential is clearly different by +124 ± 33 mV from −46
± 33 mV that was calculated above in [emim+][NTf2–] without bias from ΔLJE. Therefore, this indicates that the Fc assumption
can be used by taking this difference into account. 3a   3b   4   17  

Absolute Intrinsic Standard Chemical Potential
of the Proton
The determination of the standard electrode
potential of Fc+/Fc in Cell 3b enabled
us to calculate
the standard electrode potential of Fc+/Fc in [emim+][NTf2–] versus SHE in water.
Previously,141 we discussed electrode potentials
of Fc+/Fc in acetonitrile versus SHE, which is contacted
with the acetonitrile phase through various types of liquid junctions,
and suggested +509 ± 32 mV as a formal electrode potential of
Fc+/Fc at I = 0.02 M in acetonitrile versus
SHE, in which the conditional liquid junction potential difference
is eliminated. This potential is converted to +499 ± 32 mV for
a formal potential of Fc+/Fc at I = 0.10
M on the basis of Kolthoff and Thomas’s observation142 and supported by Roberts’ recent observation.143 As the standard electrode potential and the
formal electrode potential (I = 0.10 M) of Fc+/Fc in Cells 3b and 4 were determined to be −46 ± 33 and +78 ±
5 mV, respectively, we suggest +375 ± 33 mV as the standard electrode
potential of Fc+/Fc in [emim+][NTf2–] versus SHE in water, in which the conditional
liquid junction potential difference is eliminated (Cell 5). This value is in good agreement with the value
of +361 ± 32 mV for this potential, calculated from the standard
potential of the Ag+/Ag electrode as shown in eq 9 (E°
= +515 ± 8 mV vs E°(Fc+/Fc)
in the IL), the standard electrode potential of Ag+/Ag
in water (E° = +799 mV vs SHE144), and the standard molar Gibbs energy of transfer of Ag+ from water to the IL (+7.4 ± 3.0 kJ/mol, Table 2). Thus, it will be useful for
comparing the overpotentials of given electrocatalytic reactions in
water to those in [emim+][NTf2–] IL. 5a  This electrode potential affords the standard
transfer energy of a proton as shown in eq 18, which contains a species similar to [emim+][Ag(NTf2)2–], formed
upon dissolution of a silver salt because the proton is also known
to form a homoconjugate with two conjugate bases (i.e., anions) in
ILs.145,146,72,75 This energy is an important value to thermodynamically
relate a Brønsted acidity scale in an IL, that is, [emim+][NTf2–] here, to a unified pH
scale for all phases.110 18   19  Therefore, we can estimate the standard electrode
potential of a hydrogen electrode in [emim+][NTf2–] (eq 19) from the formal potential, which was reported to be −65
± 5 mV versus Fc+/Fc at the standard states of 1 M
of H2 and H(NTf2)2–.69,○ In this case, the activity coefficients of H2 and H(NTf2)2– are reasonably assumed to
both be unity because (1) unlike for CO2 gas, the standard
solubility (or the Henry constant) of H2 gas in [emim+][NTf2–] was found to be almost
independent of the H2 pressure;147,148 and (2) H+ is sterically shielded by two NTf2– anions, which would be more crowded than in the
case of Ag(NTf2)2–, which
itself exhibited an activity coefficient of unity as shown in Figure 2a. Then, using a
saturating concentration of H2 at 25 °C, which is
estimated to be 3.6 mM as an average of two reported values (2.6147 and 4.669 mM), the
standard electrode potential is calculated to be +7 ± 5 mV versus
Fc+/Fc in the IL at the standard states of 1 bar of H2 and 1 M of H(NTf2)2– (see the Supporting Information for details
of this calculation).△ Thus, the standard electrode
potential of eq 19 is
calculated to be +382 ± 34 mV versus SHE (in which the conditional
liquid junction potential difference is eliminated). From this, the
standard Gibbs energy change for the reaction shown in eq 20 is +36.9 ± 3.3 kJ/mol. 20  Thus, the intrinsic standard Gibbs transfer
energy of a proton from water to the IL can be estimated to be +36.9
± 3.3 kJ/mol (eq 18) because the Gibbs energy changes of formation of dihydrogen in
the IL and water at the standard state of 1 bar are defined to be
equal. In a similar manner, the intrinsic standard Gibbs transfer
energy of a proton from acetonitrile to the IL (eq 21) can be estimated to be −8.8 ±
3.3 kJ/mol (see the Supporting Information for details). 21  It is quite noteworthy that the difference
(+45.7 ± 3.3 kJ/mol) between the two transfer energies of a proton
from the IL to water and acetonitrile is in excellent agreement with
the transfer energy of a proton from water to acetonitrile (+46 kJ/mol;62 see also Table 2). Table 2 shows the standard Gibbs transfer energies of a proton from the
IL to methanol and acetonitrile, in addition to water on the intrinsic
chemical potential scale. Accordingly, the intrinsic standard transfer
energy of a proton from the IL to acetonitrile is a small positive
value, whereas that from the IL to water is a large negative value,
that is, the intrinsic standard chemical potential in the IL is similar
to that in acetonitrile and much more positive than that in water.
This indicates that a proton is much less stabilized by the IL compared
to that in water, and the magnitude is similar to that in acetonitrile.
This is consistent with previous observations,73,76 wherein values of pKa in acetonitrile
and [bmim+][NTf2–] were found
to be similar.

Considering the intrinsic standard chemical potential
of a proton in the IL enables us to firmly anchor the acidity of a
proton in the IL to the unified pH scale for all of the phases (pHabs or pHabsH2O).110,134 pHabs and
pHabsH2O define the standard Gibbs energy of formation of H+ in the gas phase110 and in water,134 respectively, to be zero, and the intrinsic
single-ion solvation free energy of a proton in water is −1105
± 8 kJ/mol,56 for the dissolution
of 1 mole of H+ in the gas phase at a pressure of 1 bar
into water to a concentration of 1 M. We can thus estimate the intrinsic
standard chemical potential of a proton in [emim+][NTf2–] to be −1068 ± 9 kJ/mol (pHabs = 187 ± 2 or pHabsH2O = −6.5 ± 0.6). Interestingly,
this value is comparable to the theoretically estimated intrinsic
value of −1071 kJ/mol80 for a proton
in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium NTf2–.

Although the intrinsic transfer energies and conditional liquid
junction potential differences we acquired in this study are values
for one particular IL ([emim+][NTf2–]), our methods and observations are general and enable the experimental
thermodynamic investigation of solution chemistry and electrochemistry
of all ILs and permit, for the first time, accurate
comparison on the basis of activity with observations in conventional
molecular solvents under the scheme of a reference electrolyte assumption,
that is, the TATB assumption.

Conclusions
Modern
ILs, which arose a few decades ago, have been found to exhibit
attractive properties for extraction, separation, synthesis, catalysis,
electrodics, and so on. Therefore, ionics (where “ionics”
refers to the physical chemistry of ions in solution and in liquids
arising from molten solids composed of ions)1 has also been studied in ILs with the goal of understanding, prescribing,
and engineering their properties. However, these studies are either
semiempirical, concentration-based (i.e., not activity-based), or
require a specific IL. This situation originates from the absence
of a good exemplar for defining the thermodynamic standard states
of ionic solutes in ILs. Until now, this has prevented us from applying
thermodynamic principles to ionics in ILs.

In this study, we
have proposed a standard component-based solvation
scheme for an ionic solute in an IL, in which the solute becomes an
integral part of the IL to yield two additional components (not two
constituents) of the IL phase. This is strikingly different from solvation
in molecular solvents of high permittivity, in which each ionic constituent
is completely solvated by the solvent molecules. Thus, an IL represents
the limiting case of zero molecular solvent. The effectiveness of
this solvation scheme was justified by four observations: (1) an ideal
Nernstian response of the electrochemical potential of a Ag+/Ag electrode in [emim+][NTf2–]; (2) ideal Nernstian responses (at 25 ± 1 and 39 ± 1
°C) of the Fc+/Fc redox couple to a ratio of concentrations
of Fc+, Fc, and importantly the IL; (3) observations of
ideal Nernstian responses at higher temperatures for the Fc+/Fc couple in ILs having even longer alkyl chains in the imidazolium
ring; and (4) pure entropic mixing of two solutions of IL each containing
TP+ and TB– salts, respectively. This
confirmation allowed us to determine the stoichiometric number of
ionic constituents of the IL involved in the dissolution of electroactive
electrolytes, the activity coefficients of which can be set to unity
in the case of the IL, [emim+][NTf2–], at 25 ± 1 °C or higher temperatures, from which the
standard electrode potential of a Ag+/Ag electrode in [emim+][NTf2–] (eq 7a) was also determined, for the first time,
to be 515 ± 8 mV versus E°(Fc+/Fc). An activity-based determination of the solubility product constants
of electrolytes resulted in the assessment of intrinsic Gibbs transfer
energies of emim+ and NTf2– from an IL to water (or actually the intrinsic Gibbs transfer energy
of relevant salts), completely describing the solubility of the IL
in water.

Meanwhile, the concept of the Gibbs transfer energy
of a “pseudo-single
ion” from an IL to a molecular solvent, which bridges component-
and constituent-based energetics, has been established by considering
two constituent ions of [emim+][NTf2–], wherein the solute cation and anion are accompanied by [NTf2–] and [emim+], respectively,
in terms of electroneutrality and stoichiometry. This type of consideration
is an extension of the concept of the hydration or solvation number
for a single ion in the case of a molecular solvent, wherein such
a number is not necessarily required to experimentally determine the
Gibbs transfer energy of a single ion in terms of electroneutrality
and stoichiometry. We then found, for the first time, that a commonly used reference electrolyte assumption, that is,
the TATB assumption, which assumes the same magnitudes of solvation
for the bulky and symmetrically shaped TA+ and TB– ions in molecular solvents, can also prevail in the IL by a comparison
of the intrinsic Gibbs transfer energies of H+.

Using
the TATB assumption with this concept under our model of
solvation, we are now able to assess ionics in ILs with the usual
thermodynamic conventions to compare with ionics in molecular solvents.
For example, a thermodynamic comparison of a given reaction (e.g.,
the one-electron-reduction of ferrocenium to ferrocene) in different
solvents (an IL and other types of solvents in this case) was achieved
by eliminating the conditional liquid junction potential difference,
which is composed of the inner potential difference (solvent–solvent
interactions) and electrolyte-dependent terms. On the basis of this
comparison, we also discussed the intrinsic standard chemical potential
of H+ in [emim+][NTf2–] as a representative IL and clarified that the proton is more acidic
than in water by 6.5 ± 0.6 units on the unified110,134 pH scale. We believe that this work has provided a key to the realm
of the thermodynamics of ionics in ILs and strengthens progress on
activity-based ionics in ILs with a rigorous thermodynamic basis.

Experimental
Section
General
Electrochemical measurements were conducted
with a BioLogic SP-200 potentiostat. Cyclic voltammograms and Osteryoung
square-wave voltammograms were recorded in deaerated IL and acetonitrile
solutions of ferrocene under N2 atmospheres at 25 ±
1 °C. A standard three-electrode cell was used, which consisted
of a disc electrode (glassy carbon, 1 mm diameter) as a working electrode,
a platinum wire as a counter electrode, and a reference electrode
as indicated in Cells 3a and 4, in which liquid junctions were formed by a Vycor frit on
the bottom of a glass tube retaining a silver wire and an electrolyte
solution. Half-wave potentials of Fc+/Fc were confirmed
to not vary with scanning rate in the voltammetric measurements. NMR
spectra were measured on a JEOL ECA600 NMR spectrometer. Isothermal
titration calorimetry was performed on a TA Instruments Nano ITC standard
volume 601000 instrument equipped with two symmetrical cells for the
titrand and the reference (0.95 mL each) and an automatic injection
syringe for the titrant. The instrument was first calibrated by measuring
the heat of ionization of 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol
(Tris; Sigma-Aldrich Trizma Base, T1503) with hydrochloric acid in
aqueous solution and by the mixing of water to water. In each experimental
run, an IL solution (typically 2.0 mM) as a titrand (prepared in a
glove box) was loaded into the reaction cell, which was thoroughly
purged with N2 until thermally stabilized in advance. The
injection syringe was filled with an IL solution (typically 20 mM)
as a titrant and then inserted into the cell under N2 flow,
after which the cell was allowed to reach equilibrium at 25.00 °C
for typically 30 min. After that, 40 μL of the titrant was automatically
injected once every 5 min a total of five times. After each injection,
the heat evolved resulting from the injection was recorded once per
second and integrated. Some solutions were analyzed by using an HPLC
system with a Tosoh TSKgel SP-2SW cation exchange column at 35 °C,
a Shimadzu LC-20ADsp pump with a Rheodyne 7725i injector, and a Shimadzu
CDD-10Asp conductivity detector. A mixed solution of acetonitrile/NaH2PO4 (0.1 M) buffer (7:3 v/v) was used as the eluent.

Materials
A silver wire (>99.99% from Aldrich) was
coiled and washed with dilute nitric acid before use. Tetraphenylphosphonium
tetraphenylborate (TP+TB–),63 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetraphenylborate
(emim+TB–),149,150 tetraphenylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TP+NTf2–),151 tetraethylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Et4N+NTf2–),152 tetrabutylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Bu4N+NTf2–),153 tetrabutylammonium tetrabutylborate (Bu4N+Bu4B–),154 ferrocenium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(Fc+NTf2–),155−157 and [Ru(bpy)2(dmb)]2+(PF6–)2158 were prepared according
to the reported methods. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium picrate (emim+pic–) was prepared in a similar manner to
the reported procedure.159 1-Methylimidazole
was distilled in vacuo before use. Methanol (Aldrich, anhydrous) and
ethanol (Kanto, anhydrous) were vacuum-transferred before use. Tetraethylammonium
perchlorate (electrochemical grade in assay of >99.0%) was used
as
received from Nacalai Tesque. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(LiNTf2, >99.7%) was purchased from Kanto Chemical Co.,
Inc. Water was purified by an Advantec (RFD240NA) Water Distillation
Apparatus (Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Ltd.). Other chemicals were obtained
from commercial sources and used without purification.

1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
([emim+][NTf2–])
This IL was prepared several times by a modification of the reported
procedure.160 The typical procedure is
as follows. 1-Methylimidazole (19.8 g, 0.241 mol) and bromoethane
(35.0 g, 0.321 mol) were added to acetonitrile (10 mL), and the solution
was heated at 50 °C for 30 h under a N2 atmosphere.
After confirmation of the disappearance of 1-methylimidazole, acetonitrile
was removed, resulting in solidification of the white bromide salt
of emim+. 1.25 g of activated charcoal (grade for column
chromatography from Nacalai Tesque) was added to a 125 g aqueous solution
of the bromide salt. The mixture was heated up to 80 °C for 30
min and then allowed to cool down to room temperature overnight on
a benchtop. The mixture was first passed through a membrane filter
made of polypropylene and then through a membrane filter made of Teflon
with a porosity of 0.1 μm, to remove the charcoal powder. To
the resulting colorless and transparent solution in the flask, an
aqueous LiNTf2 solution (ca. 50 mL prepared by dissolution
of 69.2 g of LiNTf2 (0.241 mol) in water, followed by filtration
through a membrane filter made of polypropylene with a porosity of
0.22 μm) was added. The mixture was shaken well and allowed
to stand for a while until it formed a binary phase consisting of
aqueous and IL layers. After observation of the binary phase in the
flask, the top aqueous layer was removed, and deionized water (ca.
50 mL) was added to the flask, and then the mixture was shaken well
again to remove lithium bromide from the IL phase. This procedure
for the removal of lithium bromide was repeated (typically 10 times)
until a negative AgNO3 test of the top aqueous layer indicated
that the bromide was absent from the IL phase. It was then repeated
five more times to absolutely ensure the complete absence of bromide.
The residual water on and in the resulting IL was removed in vacuo
at 60 °C for 72 h and thereafter quantified as less than 10 ppm
by a Karl-Fischer titration. Yield: 53 g (56%). Density: 1.52 g/mL
at 25 °C (by pycnometry); lit.:161 1.517 g/mL. UV–vis absorption (l = 1 cm;
vs water): 0.35 at 350 nm, 0.01 at 400 nm, and 0.005 at 450 nm. Electrochemical
window (Pt foil used as the working electrode at j < 1 mA/cm2 under an argon atmosphere): 4.2 V; lit.162 4.2 V.

Silver Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(AgNTf2)
This compound was prepared by the reported
procedure163,164 from silver carbonate (>95%
from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.)
and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amine (>98% from Wako Pure Chemical
Industries Ltd.) and precipitated from the ethereal solution with
anhydrous hexane under an argon atmosphere with a yield of 50%. Anal.
Calcd for C2AgF6NO4S2:
C, 6.19%; N, 3.61%. Found: C, 5.93%; H, 0.06%; N, 3.88%. This is a
deliquescent fine white powder, and, therefore, it was stored under
an argon atmosphere at room temperature in the dark.

Potentiometric
Titrations
The titrations were performed
by using a combination of a syringe holding a titrant and a custom-made,
air-tight, jacketed electrochemical cell holding a magnetic stirring
bar and a titrand at 25 ± 1 °C (temperature maintained by
a water circulator). The main compartment of the cell has five top
ports, which are sealed with Teflon–silicone rubber gaskets
in GL14-threaded fittings when unused. The main compartment held a
neat IL or an IL solution (typically 1.515 g determined by weight).
The five ports were usually fitted with: (1) a silver coil, (2) a
platinum coil, (3) a glass tube retaining a Vycor frit to isolate
an IL solution of [Ru(bpy)2(dmb)]2+(PF6–)2 (denoted as “Ru2+”), into which a glassy carbon electrode was immersed to act
as an internal redox standard, (4) a glass tube retaining a Vycor
frit (or a sintered glass frit with a porosity of 5 μm) to isolate
an IL solution of AgNTf2 (ca. 1 mM), into which a silver
coil was immersed to act as a reference electrode, and (5) two Teflon
tubes: one supplying a stream of N2 in and out of the cell
and the other attached to the syringe needle. After addition of a
certain volume of the titrant, the solution in the main compartment
was stirred well for at least 15 min, and the potential difference
between ports 1 and 4 was measured, wherein port 4 was treated as
the left-hand side of Cells 1a, 1b, and S1. During this measurement,
the electrochemical potential of port 4 was calibrated occasionally
against the half-wave potential165 of the
redox couple of the ruthenium complex, E1/2(Ru3+/Ru2+), in port 3 measured by cyclic voltammetry
using ports 2, 3, and 4 as counter, working, and reference electrodes,
respectively. Finally, this potential versus E1/2(Ru3+/Ru2+) in the IL was first converted
to a value versus the half-wave potential of the ferrocenium/ferrocene
(Fc+/Fc) couple139 in the IL
and then to a value versus the standard electrode potential of the
Fc+/Fc couple according to eq 16, wherein the term for the ratio of diffusion
coefficients (DR/DO) is reported as 1.37, and the terms for the mole fraction
can be approximated to unity.139 The ratio
of diffusion coefficients (DR/DO) at 39 ± 1 °C was determined to
be 1.3 by the Shoup–Szabo method166 using Fc and Fc+NTf2– solutions.
For the experiment as depicted in Figure 2b, only ports 2, 4, and 5 were used. The
actual concentration [mol/L] of Ag(NTf2)2– and the mole fraction of NTf2–, with regard to all of the anionic species in the IL solution in
the main compartment to which the titrant was added dropwise were
calculated by the method described below.

Measurements of Potential
Differences of Cells 2a and 2b
These potential differences
were measured by two methods: (1) direct measurement; and (2) indirect
measurement through the half-wave potential of the ferrocenium/ferrocene
couple in the IL as follows. In the case of Cell 2a in which “sol” is methanol or acetonitrile, the half-wave
potentials were determined in reference to a Ag+/Ag electrode
in the IL (Cell 6a) and a Ag+/Ag
electrode in acetonitrile (Cell 6b), and then
the potential difference of Cell 2a was calculated
by subtraction of the latter half-wave potential from the former half-wave
potential. In the case of Cell 2b, the potential
difference was calculated in the same way, except with the use of
Cells 6a and 6c. This
indirect method afforded a value in agreement with that measured directly,
within the experimental error of the measurements as denoted in each
potential difference. 6a   6b   6c  

Calculation of Concentration and Mole Fraction
in Potentiometric
Titrations
To interconvert between the concentration [mol/L]
of Ag(NTf2)2– and the mole
fraction of NTf2– with regard to all
of the anionic species in the IL solution in the main compartment,
to which the titrant was added dropwise, the molar volume of [emim+][Ag(NTf2)2–], which
is formed upon dissolution of AgNTf2 in [emim+][NTf2–],121,123 was first measured as 0.15 L/mol at a molality of 0.660 mol/kg at
25 ± 1 °C. The molar volume of [emim+][TB–] was not measured
because we prepared ca. 1 mM of emim+TB– solution, at which the mole fraction of [emim+][NTf2–] can still be approximated
to unity. The molar volume of [Fc+][NTf2–] was measured as 0.30 L/mol at a molality of 0.660
mol/kg at 25 ± 1 °C. For the experiment as depicted in Figure 2a in the text, an
emim+Ag(NTf2)2– solution and neat [emim+][NTf2–] were placed in the syringe and the main compartment, respectively.
For the experiment as depicted in Figure S2, an emim+TB– solution and an emim+Ag(NTf2)2– solution
were placed in the syringe and the main compartment, respectively.
To calculate the concentration, c [mol/L], and the
mole fraction, xIL, eqs 22 and 23 were used,
respectively, wherein the molar volume of emim+Ag(NTf2)2– or emim+TB– was assumed to be constant upon dilution of a titrant
(vt [L] in the range of 100–400
μL of ct [mol/L] with density of dt [g/L]) with a titrand, the initial weight, wd [g] (initial moles of NTf2– anion, md [mol]), of which
was typically 1.515 g (0.003520 mol). In eq 22, d is the density of pure
[emim+][NTf2–] (1517 g/L).161 In eq 23, mt′ is the number of moles of [emim+][NTf2–] in the titrant, MIL is the molar mass constant of [emim+][NTf2–] (391.31 g/mol), and MAgNTf2 is the molar mass constant of AgNTf2 (388.02
g/mol). For the experiment as depicted in Figure 2b, instead of using the syringe, solid Fc+NTf2– (mFc+ [mol]) was added to a solution of the IL (md [mol]) containing Fc (mFc [mol]) in the main compartment under nitrogen flow. In this case,
the ratio of C([Fc+][NTf2–]) to C(Fc) and the mole fraction, xIL, were calculated by eqs 24 and 25, respectively. 22   23   24   25  

Solubility Measurements
When the solvent was [emim+][NTf2–], the total solubility
of a given salt was determined by measuring a 1H NMR spectrum
of the solution containing an internal standard. A sealed glass tube
containing D2O was placed in an NMR tube equipped with
a J-Young valve, and, in a glove box, the salt, [emim+][NTf2–], and an [emim+][NTf2–] solution of dimethylsulfone as an internal standard
were weighed and sealed in the NMR tube under an argon atmosphere.
The amount of dimethylsulfone solution added was adjusted in order
not to exceed one-tenth of the final concentration of the salt. The
tube was allowed to stand at 25 ± 1 °C overnight. After
observation that a small amount of solid salt was still left inside
the tube, the tube was loaded into the spectrometer at room temperature,
and the NMR spectrum was measured as soon as possible. A change of
the density upon the dissolution was corrected for when the final
concentration exceeded 0.1 M. This experiment was repeated at least
twice using different final concentrations of dimethylsulfone (including
none) to estimate the experimental error and confirm that the presence
of dimethylsulfone does not affect the solubility more than the experimental
error. When the solvent was methanol, water–ethanol, or water,
the total solubility of a given salt was determined by measuring a
UV–vis absorption spectrum of the solution. A solution saturated
with the salt of interest at 25 ± 1 °C was diluted by a
certain ratio, and the spectrum was recorded. The concentrations were
calculated from molar absorption coefficients of TB– (2.12 × 103 M–1 cm–1 at 274 nm in methanol128) and pic– (1.44 and 1.56 × 104 M–1 cm–1 at 355 nm in methanol and water, respectively128) and corrected to the solubility. The molar
absorption coefficient of TP+ was unavailable, and so its
value was determined to be 3850 ± 40 M–1 cm–1 at 275 nm in water–ethanol (80:20 mol/mol)
by using a solution of TP+NTf2– of a known concentration. Et4N+NTf2– in water and aqueous ethanol were analyzed using
an HPLC system. The total solubilities of Bu4N+NTf2– and Bu4N+Bu4B– were determined volumetrically.

Calculation of Solubility Product Constant
The solubility
product constant was calculated from the mean activity, which is a
product of the mean activity coefficient, γ±, the total solubility, C [mol/L], and the degree
of dissociation, α (taken to be unity,167 except in methanol as discussed below), as shown in eq 26, wherein “sol” denotes
the solvent used. In eq 26, values of γ± were estimated by using the
Davies equation61,168 (eq 27), which is one of the extended Debye–Hückel
equations, where εr is the relative permittivity
(32.7, 35.9, 78.3, and 54.5 in methanol,169 acetonitrile,170 water,171 and water–ethanol (80:20 mol/mol)172 as “sol”, respectively), and T is the temperature (298.15 K). In the case of methanol, γ± and α were iteratively calculated by using eqs 27 and 28(167) where KA is the association constant, which was assumed to be the
averaged value (63 M–1) of association constants
for TP+pic– (54 M–1)128 and Bu4N+TB– (72 M–1).61 26   27   28

§ Although there is a surface potential
difference between the solid phase of the electrolyte and the liquid
phase of the solution, the energetics upon transferring the whole
salt are not affected by the surface potential difference.

⊥ Theoretically, the accuracy
of energies derived by the reference electrolyte assumption can be
tested by calculation of the Gibbs transfer energy of one ion, typically
a proton, because if the absolute Gibbs transfer energy of one ion
is known, the Gibbs transfer energies of other ions can be derived
from precisely measured Gibbs transfer energies of whole salts. In
fact, values of the absolute Gibbs transfer energy of a proton calculated
by the cluster-pair approximation57,110,173,174 show good agreement
with the values derived by the reference electrolyte assumption.

∥ Typically, an electrochemical
cell is composed of multiple phases in series forming interfaces where
junction potential differences that are developed or eliminated (or
are negligible) are denoted by “|” or “⫶⫶”,
respectively. Silver metal at both ends is used for potential difference
measurements referring to the left-hand side as a reference potential.

¶ The conditional liquid junction
potential differences developed by differences in concentrations in
both sides of the cell are roughly estimated to both be up to 1 mV,
provided the Henderson equation is operational, where concentrations
of [emim+] and [NTf2–] are
both 3.87 M at the lowest concentration of [Ag(NTf2)2–], and concentrations of [emim+], [NTf2–], and [Ag(NTf2)2–] are 3.64, 3.25, and 0.39 M, respectively,
at the highest concentration of [Ag(NTf2)2–]. In fact, a control experiment using tetrabutylammonium
NTf2– in place of AgNTf2 showed
good agreement with this estimation (see the Supporting Information for details). These potential differences are small
enough to be negligible compared with experimental precision. Also,
an unfused Vycor glass will have pores with some chemical traps175 that could affect some permanent selectivity
favoring cation or anion transport through the frit. Nevertheless,
a cell using a sintered glass frit with a porosity of 5 μm exhibited
an identical result to that when Cell 1b was used with a Vycor frit
as shown in Figure 2b, indicating that high concentrations of ions
in the IL are likely to mitigate such chemical traps.

# When
a sintered glass disc with a
porosity of 5 μm was used as the frit material in Cells 2a and
2b, the potential differences of the cells were measured as −444
mV for Cell 2a using acetonitrile as “sol” and −602
mV for Cell 2b. Although these values are different from those measured
when a Vycor glass frit was used, our conclusions are not affected
by this difference as long as the potential differences developed
in a frit made of the same material are measured throughout our discussion.

□ Half-wave potentials when
a
sintered glass disc was used as the frit material in Cells 3a and
4 are different from those measured when a Vycor glass frit was used.
However, our conclusions are not affected by this difference as long
as the potential differences developed in a frit made of the same
material are measured throughout our discussion.

○ This potential was found to
reflect the reaction: H+ + e– ↔ 1/2H2, confirmed
by a good agreement of experiments using various metals and concentrations
of acid and hydrogen gas with a kinetic model, assuming the reaction
is first-order and the electron transfer to H+ is the rate-determining
step.69 This potential was then calculated
by using two potentials: the formal potential of a hydrogen electrode
in the IL, and the formal potential of an Fc+/Fc couple,
both referenced to a micro-Ag+/Ag electrode, which was
assembled with a molecular sieve (3 Å) as the liquid junction
material.69 Although this reference electrode
has a certain conditional liquid junction potential difference, the
potential of this reference electrode including this potential difference
will be canceled out when any two potentials referred to this reference
electrode are compared.

△ According to eq 19, strictly
speaking, conversion from a formal to a standard potential requires
one to correct the term of mole fractions of emim+NTf2– and NTf2–. However, formal concentrations of HNTf2 used for determination
of the formal potential were less than 40 mM so that the term is practically
negligible (<1 mV).
