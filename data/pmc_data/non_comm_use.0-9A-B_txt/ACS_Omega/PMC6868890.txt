An
increase of nucleate pool boiling with the use of different
fluid properties has received much attention. In particular, the presence
of nanostructures in fluids to enhance boiling was given special consideration.
This study compares the effects of graphene nanoplatelet (GNP), functionalized
GNP with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and multiwalled carbon nanotube
(CNT) nanofluids on the pool boiling heat transfer coefficient and
the critical heat flux (CHF). Our findings showed that at the same
concentration, CHF for functionalized GNP with PEG (GNP–PEG)/deionized
water (DW) nanofluids was higher in comparison with GNP- and CNT-based
nanofluids. The CHF of the GNP/DW nanofluids was also higher than
that of CNT/DW nanofluids. The CHF of GNP–PEG was 72% greater
than that of DW at the concentration of 0.1 wt %. There is good agreement
between measured critical heat fluxes and the Kandlikar correlation.
In addition, the current results proved that the GNP–PEG/DW
nanofluids are highly stable over 3 months at a concentration of 0.1
wt %.

1 Introduction
Ever since the discovery
of zero-dimensional fullerene (C60) and one-dimensional
(1-D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) 20 years ago,
carbon materials have received increased attention. In 2004, monolayer
two-dimensional graphene was successfully isolated and this instigated
a profound global interest because of its unique structural, thermal,
and electronic properties, which could enhance the performance of
graphene-based nanofluids for many applications.1−5

In recent years, many studies have conducted
to explore nanofluids
in vapor–liquid flow and single-phase systems. It reported
the enhancement in heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) and Nusselt numbers
in single-phase applications. Because the latent heat is very high,
boiling (liquid–vapor phase change) is known as the most effective
heat transfer method.6,7 This method is used in numerous
industrial procedures including electronic chip cooling, steam generation,
refrigeration, different chemical processes, nuclear reactor cooling,
and pressurized water reactors. Pool boiling is considered a more
complex method, which is affected by various factors including the
thermal characteristics of liquid and vapor phases, saturation temperatures,
and orientation, size, and surface properties related to the heater.8

A nanofluid contains nanometer-sized particles
(e.g., carbon nanostructures,
carbides, metals, or oxides). Because of their thermal and mechanical
characteristics and their chemical stability, CNTs, and graphene are
favorable augmentatives among different carbon nanostructures for
use in heat transfer equipment.9,10

Past research
studies11−13 have shown that nanofluids with
graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and CNTs enhance the critical heat flux
(CHF) and pool boiling characteristics; however, the HTC decreases
for CNTs and often increases for graphene.

2 Literature
Review
Many studies have investigated the enhancement of
pool boiling
of HTC and CHF through various nanofluids. To increase the magnitude
of CHF, different nanoparticles such as graphene, TiO2, Al2O3, and CNTs were utilized.14−17 Kamatchi and Venkatachalapathy18 used
reduced graphene oxide water nanofluids/(RGO) to study the behavior
of pool boiling CHF in a thin electrically heated Ni–Cr wire.
It was seen that adding RGO nanoparticles increases the CHF (145–245%).
Umesh and Raja19 conducted pool boiling
HTC (BHTC) using CuO/pentane nanofluids in contact with milled and
smooth circular brass surfaces (diameter = 20 mm) at the 100 kPa and
for a range of heat fluxes from 10 to 100 kW cm–2. It was seen that for the CuO/pentane nanofluids at low concentrations
of 0.005 vol % led to an increase of 15–25% in the HTC. They
also showed that as nanoparticle concentrations increased, the enhancement
in the HTC decreased. Vafaei20 conducted
pool boiling to describe how HTC is affected by surface roughness,
nanofluid concentrations, and heat flux. It was found that the CHF
increased with increase in the nanoparticle concentration. The CHF
enhancement, however, decreased as heat flux increased because of
the size of large cavities that formed at low heat fluxes and as well
as little cavities that were active at high heat fluxes.

Q wide
range of studies has recently focused on nanofluids using
graphene suspensions and CNTs. Milanova and Kumar21 studied the nucleate boiling of water-based single-walled
CNT suspensions. The suspensions were efficient at both the CHF and
improving the nucleate boiling of HTC. Because of the existence of
CNTs and surfactants, the surface tension of the nanofluids is lower
than the base fluid, which causes an increase in the CHF. With the
addition of a surfactant with a weight concentration ratio to CNTs
of 1:5, a maximum CHF improvement four times higher than a surfactant
to CNT concentration ratio of 1:1 was obtained. Liu et al.22 investigated HTC of nucleate pool boiling for
water-based nanofluids. Its diameter was 15 nm, and its length was
from 5 to 15 μm with multiwalled CNTs at concentrations of 0.5–4.0
wt %. The CNT nanofluids significantly increased the HCT of nucleate
boiling and the corresponding CHF than pure water. For comparison,
Liu et al. also studied boiling with pure water on a CNTs-coated surface
and observed that the CNTs nanofluids provided better increase for
both CHF and nucleate BHTCs. Park and Kim23 stated that at a concentration of 0.001 vol % multi-walled CNTs
the nanofluids optimally increased the CHF and HTC of nucleate boiling.
Park and Jung24 concluded up to 30% rise
in HTC of the nucleate boiling using hydrochlorofluorocarbon better
known as R22-and water-based 1.0 vol % CNT nanofluids. Park et al.25 examined the CHF improvements using a water-based
0.0001 vol % graphene oxide (GO) nanofluid. It was found that GO nanofluids
are constant in complex cooling configuration. Kamatchi and Venkatachalapathy18 showed that as concentration increases from
0.01 to 0.3 g/L, a 145–245% increase in the CHF could be achieved
with RGO nanofluids. Ahn et al.26 investigated
the increasing potential of RGO suspensions in water that was chemically
treated with hydrazine. The aim of the chemical treatment was to create
various steps of flakiness in the deposited layer for various RGO
concentrations during nucleate boiling. The results indicated that
the increased fluid thermal conductivity resulted in boiling to begin
earlier in comparison to the base fluid. In addition, it was found
that increased RGO concentrations agree with nucleate boiling heat
transfer, which was credited to thermal resistance from the thickly
aggregated graphene layer (TGL) forming on the heating surface. Ahn
et al.26 found a significant boiling phenomenon
for RGO colloids. In contrast to the fast increase in CHF wall temperature
in pure water, the wall temperature for RGO colloids enhanced too
smoothly, while wall heat flux was remained at the CHF. This issue
postponed dry/hot spot formation, resulting from heat-spreading action
in the base graphene layer and self-assembled foam, and the useful
impact of boiling in a spongy medium. Kathiravan et al.27 performed a comparison between the nucleate
boiling efficiency of water-based CNTs nanofluids from 0.25 to 1.0
vol % (concentrations range). It was conducted with and without the
addition of 9.0 wt % sodium lauryl sulfate surfactant. In case of
stable heat flux of 50 W/cm2, it was seen a 1.5, 2.6, and
3.0-fold rise in HTC of nucleate boiling with nanofluids without surfactant
at CNT concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 vol %, respectively (than
pure water). Sulaiman et al.28 found the
same results with SiO2 nanofluids that were credited to
the little separation of the nanoparticle deposition layer at high
heat fluxes nearing.

In this study, GNP, CNTs, and functionalized
GNP with polyethylene
glycol (GNP–PEG) nanofluids were synthesized in weight concentrations
of 0.01 wt, 0.05 wt, and 0.1 wt %. Then, the nucleate pool boiling
of above-mentioned nanofluids is compared with deionized water (DW).
Also, the thermal conductivity of nanofluids and the surface characterization
were investigated.

3 Materials and Methods
3.1 Materials
For performing this study,
GNP (diameter = 1–20 μm, thickness = less than 40 nm)
and multiwalled CNTs (length = 5–10 μm, average diameter
= f 20–30 nm, tube) were purchased from Vira
Carbon Nano Materials (VCN Materials Co., Ltd.). Also, dimethylformamide
(DMF), PEG, hydrochloric acid, and aluminum chloride were acquired
from Merck, Ind.

3.2 Preparation of Nanofluids
CNT- and
GNP-based nanofluids with weight concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, and
0.1% in a base fluid were prepared using a two-step method. The process
was started by mixing GNP at given weight percentages with DW, so
that a consistent suspension might be achieved. This was followed
by an ultrasonic bath (200 W, 4 L capacity, 60 kHz) to create homogenous
samples in 2 h. Functionalization of CNT and GNP was performed noncovalently
or covalently. CNT and GNP are treated with various functional groups
including different surfactants [PVP, gum Arabic (GA), SDBS, and etc.]
for noncovalent functionalization.12,29−31 Furthermore, GA was used as a noncovalent group. Its ratio was 1–1
because of CNT in DW and the low dispersivity of pristine GNP.30 Then after, the functionalization method was
employed using covalent groups. It should be noted that functionalization,
which was used for the synthesis of PEG-based GNP, was described by
Amiri et al.32−34Figure 1 schematically shows the preparation techniques for GNP/DW and CNT/DW
as noncovalent nanofluids and GNP–PEG/DW as a covalent nanofluid.

Figure 1 Schematic
of the preparation of covalent and noncovalent for GNP
and CNT nanofluids.

In the current study,
agate mortar received AlCl3 as
a Lewis acid (184.5 mgr). Raw GNP (10 mg) was then mixed for a few
minutes. Subsequently, the resulting mixture with 10 mL PEG was dispensed
in a Teflon vessel, followed by sonication at 50 °C for 30 min
to obtain a stable suspension. Then, by adding one drop of 0.5 mL
concentrated hydrochloric acid, sonication was carried out. In the
next step, the mixture temperature was increased to 120 °C in
a microwave (Milestone Micro SYNTH programmable microwave system)
for 30 min using a 700 W. As reaction completed, it showed a reducing
trend for the temperature of the final product to room temperature.
In addition, the mixture was filtered by a thin layer of Teflon membrane.
To remove any unreacted material, DMF and copious amounts of DW were
used. Then, the mixture was dried by a vacuum at 50 °C. Figure 2 shows schematic
of GNP functionalization processes with PEG.

Figure 2 Schematic illustration
of the functionalized of GNP with PEG.

3.3 Experimental Setup
Figure 3 depicts pool boiling setup
experimentally. It was planned to run pool boiling experiments in
order to measure the CHF and boiling heat transfer under atmospheric
pressure. This setup is comprised of four major components: (a) monitoring
system and power control, (b) boiling vessel, (c) section to test
sample (boiling surface), and (d) section of heating.

Figure 3 Schematic of the pool
boiling setup.

The boiling vessel was a 300 mm
×150 mm × 150 mm rectangular.
It was made of Pyrex with proper thermal resistance. The boiling vessel
had four observation windows and would allow for setting the test
section horizontally so that it is visible boiling phenomena on the
test heater. A hole was prepared at the bottom of the vessel in which
the major heater was mounted (stainless steel heater block). A tiny
Teflon layer was used to ban heat loss and liquid leakage between
the hole and the block heater.

The section of heating was a
S.S. heater block with four cartridge
heaters. Each cartridge heater had a height of 90 mm and a maximum
heating power of 700 W. The top of the main pool chamber was mounted
by a reflux condenser in order to avoid DW evaporation.

Because
rock wool and Teflon were used for the insulation of the
S.S. block (owe to low thermal conductivity of 0.03–0.25 W/m·K),
the heat transfer through the block is made simple as the one-D steady-state
conduction heat transfer problem. This assumption was verified during
the experiment when the temperatures of thermocouples 3 and 5 were
the same (Figure 4).
The section of testing samples was situated on top of a cylindrical
S.S. block with a diameter of 40 mm at the bottom of the pool (Figures 3 and 4). The roughness of the test surface was prepared to less
than 1 μm. Using conduction from the heating section, test samples
were heated, which was comprised of four cartridge heaters. All parts
of the experimental setup and S.S. block were insulated to minimize
heat loss using Teflon and rock wool.

Figure 4 Details of the geometrical properties
of the heater surface and
heater block.

The bulk temperature was retained
at 100 °C through the auxiliary
heater feedback control based on thermocouple readings during the
experiment,that is, the whole boiling vessel was heated initially
using an external auxiliary heater around the vessel before the boiling
starts to make sure that the bulk test fluid was at a temperature
lower the boiling temperature.

Monitoring system and power control
included the following devices.
Five K-type thermocouples (T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5) were inserted in
the S.S. cylinder (Figure 4) in order to monitor temperature. Because the distance between
the thermal conductivity of the S.S. heater block and thermocouples
was clear, using measured temperature, the heat flux through the test
surface (Twall) was calculated according to the Fourier law. Through
the extrapolation, the surface temperature was found. Four thermocouples
were located at various locations points in the fluid to check the
local temperature.

Data collection for heat flux and thermocouple
temperatures was
performed using a data acquisition system (Dataloger-CUP110). A dc
power supply [contact voltage regulator of 20 kW (OMGV20K-1P)] displayed
various input powers and regulated the heater surface temperature.
The boiling apparatus including condenser, vessel, and pipes was fully
insulated to decrease unclearly in the setup. The top of the vessel
was installed by a condenser (a safety valve and a copper tube) in
order to condense the vapor into a liquid and control pressure and
condense the vapor into a liquid.

3.4 Data
Reduction and Uncertainty
It
is vital to estimate the uncertainties in HTC measurements and heat
flux in these experiments. In this study, the method created by Jaikumar
et al.16 was used to calculate uncertainties.
The thermocouple calibration, the thermal conductivity of stainless
steel, and the distances between thermocouples all have a certain
error in calculations.

In this study, heat loss was calculated
to make sure that heat is transferred through 1-D conduction to the
test surface. It was predicted (based on Fourier law of heat conduction)
that the temperature profile is linear across the test section was.
This assumption was validated as the temperature of thermocouples
4 and 5 was the same as thermocouple 3.

Figure 5 presents
the temperature distribution for heat fluxes of 393, 114, and 519
kW/m2, which was plotted between T1 and T3 for the test surface. Figure 5 depicts a linear
improvement with R squared value near to 1, showing
very little heat loss during the experiments.

Figure 5 Temperature distributions
at different heat fluxes measured between
T3 and T1.

Two errors happen during experiment;
the bias error as consequence
of calibration and exactness errors due to sensitivity of testing
devices. The total errors are 1  Uy is the uncertainty and By and Py are the
bias and precision errors, respectively. Thermocouple calibrations,
stainless steel thermal conductivity, and the distance between thermocouples
on the test chip were the error parameters. The thermocouple exactness
error was obtained statistically as ±0.1 °C.

The evaluation
of heated surface temperature (Tw) was
performed via the heater temperature (Tth), which
is measured by the heat flux (q″)
and thermocouple.35 Its issue was due to
the fact that the measurement of temperature at the heated surface
is affected by the bubble growth process because of variations in
the heated surface geometry. The temperature of the heated surface
was evaluated using a 1-D heat conduction equation. The heat flux
was assumed to be transferred in the axial direction. Accordingly,
the heat flux is given as 2  

The temperature gradient dT/dx was
obtained using a three-point backward Taylor series 3  where T3, T2, and T1 were the
temperatures corresponding to the test chip bottom, middle, and top,
respectively. Using eq 2, the boiling surface temperature is given as 4  where Tw is the
temperature of the boiling surface, k is the thermal
conductivity, and x1 is the distance between
the boiling surface. For all test surfaces, x1 was 1 mm (see Figure 4).

In eq 4, q″ is the heat flux that was obtained using 5  where Vheater is
the voltage, Icircuit is an electric current
of the experimental heater, and Asur is
the area of the heated surface.

The insulation of the test section
heater was done using rock wool
and Teflon, and thus the dominant heat transfer mechanism was a 1-D
conduction heat transfer. The heat fluxes from eqs 4 and 5 were compared
to show the heat loss along the heater block.17 The surface temperature of the test heater surface was extrapolated
to calculate the HTC of pool boiling. The pool BHTC is an indicator
of nanofluid thermal performance, which was obtained using 6  where Tw is the
temperature at the heated surface, and Tsat is saturation temperature. The uncertainties for heat flux and the
BHTC were obtained as follows 7   8  where U is the experimental
error that is defined based on all relevant parameters such as q″, h, T, k, and ΔT. The multimeter readings
and thermocouples were carried out three times to make sure data reproducibility.
Thermocouples showed the maximum deviation of measurement at about
0.1%. Table 1 summarizes
the uncertainties for measurement devices employed in the current
study.

Table 1 Uncertainty of measurement parameters.

bulk temperature (T)	°C	±0.01	
heat transfer coefficient
(h)	W/m2 K	±9.03%	
According to the measurement accuracy displayed in Table 1 and using eqs 7 and 8, the maximum
error for BHTC and heat flux was 9.3 and 3.53%, respectively.

Figure 6 shows the
computed uncertainty percentages for heat flux and boiling heat transfer.
With the increase in thermal flux, the temperature differences increase
and the uncertainty percentage decreases. Thus, for heat fluxes higher
than 600 kw/m2, heat flux uncertainty is 2.4%, and the
BHTC was 6.92%.

4 Results
and Discussion
4.1 Thermal Conductivity of
Nanofluids
Typically, the thermal conductivity of nanofluids
is higher compared
with that of base fluids and it enhances with the growth of nanoparticle
concentration; thus, the heat transfer properties of base fluids are
less than nanofluids. Therefore, it makes them to be a proper selection
for heat transfer applications.36 A KD2
Pro device (Decagon devices, Inc., USA) measured the nanofluid thermal
conductivity in the temperature (20–60 °C). A transient
short hot-wire method was employed. As a test fluid, DW was utilized
to calibrate the experimental setup before testing nanofluid.37,38 The nanofluid sample was poured into a glass container and retained
in a circulating DW bath system at a stable temperature (capacity:
5 L, Make: JEIO Tech, Korea, temperature stability: ±0.05/0.09
°C, temperature: −25 to +150 °C). It is worth mentioning
that the thermal conductivity of each nanofluid was measured five
times for various weight fractions of GNP and CNT at temperatures
from 20 to 60 °C. That is, on average, five data points were
reported. The thermal conductivities of CNT/DW and GNP/DW nanofluids
are depicted in Figure 7. The results indicate that with increased temperatures, the thermal
conductivity of DW, pristine CNT, and GNP and functionalized GNP with
PEG (GNP–PEG)-bases DW nanofluids at all concentrations increased.
It is evident that the thermal conductivity of the base fluid and
nanofluids is dependent on both temperature and weight fraction (wt
%).

Figure 7 Thermal conductivity of CNT/, GNP/, and GNP–PEG/ based DW
nanofluids as a function of temperature and weight fraction.

With the increase of temperature increases (20–60
°C)
and concentration (0.01–0.1 wt %), growth of the thermal conductivity
was observed for all samples. The progression for PEG-functionalized
GNP nanofluids was significantly more than the raw GNP and CNT nanofluids.
This issue suggests that graphene nanofluids can enhance thermal conductivity
with the growth of temperature and concentration (up to 0.1 wt %).
Brownian motion can explain this trend based on the random motion
of the nanoparticles in base fluid, which move at a higher intensity
when temperature increases.39 This may
also be because of the increased destruction of functional groups
through the growth of temperature because samples with higher concentration
include more functional groups. Through little omitting of functional
groups from graphene, the distribution of nanosheets is decreased
with a slight growth in conduction conductivity. The present thermal
conductivity data related to various samples are consistent with the
results obtained by Baby and Ramaprabhu40 and Ghozatloo et al.41 and other studies.42−47

Figure 7 expresses
the higher thermal conductivity of PEG-functionalized graphene (0.1
wt %) compared with other samples. In addition, with the increase
of nanofluid temperatures, the highest percentage of change (about
20%) of thermal conductivity is observed for the GNP–PEG nanofluid
(0.1 wt %). The GNP–PEG nanofluid (0.1 wt %) also shows the
highest percentage of increase in thermal conductivity than DW (near
20%) at the maximum operating temperature of 60 °C. The percentage
of increase for raw GNP nanofluids and CNT is 9 and 6%, respectively,
at the same concentration. According to Akbari et al.,48,49 a two-fold increase in GNP concentration
and a tenfold increase in CNT concentration are required to equally
enhance the thermal conductivity for GNP functionalized with PEG.

4.2 Surface Characterization
Vessel cleaning
is a significant step. This is due to the fact that following the
nanofluid tests and all surfaces included in the experimental setup
are covered with a deposit of a small number of nanoparticles. These
deposits may distort the progress of the nucleate boiling regime and
the corresponding CHF in the DW tests (even with low GNP or CNT concentrations).
Here, cleaning was done according to the protocol introduced by Mourgues
et al.50 As indicated in Figure 8, pictures (8a–d) display
the test surfaces (stainless steel 316) before and after the boiling
process for different nanofluids.

Figure 8 Pictures of the test surface (a) before
boiling, (b) CNT/DW, (c)
GNP/DW, and (d) GNPPEG/DW nanofluids (0.1 wt %).

It is known that because of the deposition layer, the contact angle
decreased. It may be worth mentioning that for the pristine and functionalized
GNP nanofluids, the contact angle decreases much more than that for
the CNT nanofluids. The decreasing trend of the contact angle causes
the liquid drop to spread on the surface so that more of the surface
is in contact with the liquid drop. The deposition layer is porous,
so it is expected that capillary wicking action would occur in this
layer. Then, the porous layer absorbs liquid, and liquid inflows are
generated. Therefore, more liquid is captured in the porous layer
at lower contact angles.17

4.3 Pool Boiling and CHF Results
While
increased nanofluid thermal conductivity is attractive, it is not sufficient
for its large-scale use in cooling applications. The value of such
fluids depends on the boiling characteristics under various conditions.51

Because base fluids have less thermal
conductivity than nanofluids, the heat transfer characteristics of
nanofluids are more favorable compared with base fluids. The boiling
is a greatly efficient and common mode of heat transfer. In the boiling
process, a liquid transforms into vapor over a hot surface and takes
away huge thermal energy with a little temperature diversity.

To examine the reliability of the present laboratory apparatus,
a comparison was carried out between prediction correlations of Rohsenow’s
and the experimental results for the nucleate pool boiling heat transfer
of DW.52 This correlation expresses that
the major heat transfer mechanism is the convection strength in nucleate
boiling conditions. This is because of turbulence from bubble vapor
(fluid is at saturated condition).

Figure 9 compares
the present experimental data for heat versus superheat temperature
for DW with the Rohsenow’s correlation. The experimental results
for the boiling curve as a function of the superheat on the surface
were consistent with the predictions of Rohsenow.52 The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was about 14.26%
for heat flux diversities. Figure 9 also shows that high MAPE is nearly 19% at low heat
flux, while low MAPE was about 11 for high and moderate heat flux
conditions. The small differences observed between the prediction
of the Rohsenow equation and the experimental data. This is because
of fluid thermal characteristics and the initial parameters of the
equation such as heat flux and so on.

Figure 9 Comparison of heat flux as a function
of difference superheat temperatures
for experimental data with Rohsenow’s correlation of the DW.

The maximum heat flux is considered as the critical
heat flux (CHF).
In this amount of nucleate, high cooling efficiency is incurred through
boiling heat transfer. The best CHF amount is normal while the contact
angle is approximately zero. Capillary action significantly improves
the heat transfer at angles.53 Thus, it
is expected that more CHF improvements are found out at higher weight
concentrations, which is consistent with our findings. The impact
of surface wettability for graphene/GO nanofluids and alumina–water
nanofluid was examined by Park et al.54 However, no relationship between surface wettability and CHF enhancement
was found. H. D. Kim and M. H. Kim55 suggested
that capillary wicking on the nanoporous layer causes dry out to be
delayed and cools the dry spot, leading to the CHF improvement. Ahn
et al.56 reported that during RGO nucleate
boiling, water absorption could play a role in the saturated porous
layer. The results show that CHF enhanced up to 320%. Nevertheless,
they stated that capillary wicking alone cannot explain the mechanism
behind the unusual increase of around 320% in CHF. Although the described
mechanism may justify the CHF increment for nanofluid, more studies
need to determine the precise mechanism for the unusual increase of
CHF in other nanofluids.

To carry out the tests for obtaining
the CHF requires high heat
fluxes, which is an important technical challenge. As a matter of
fact, under atmospheric conditions, the CHF for the clean heating
surface and DW is 700–1400 kW/m2, which can be achieved
by a nanofluid with a heat flux of 2000 kW/m2 or higher
as reported in the literature. To this end, some studies recommended
a direct electric heating system using a surface or wire where the
calculations for wall temperature and heat flux are based on the changes
in electrical resistance and input power.50 In this situation, samples are normally fractured while the CHF
is achieved. This is due to the fact that the sample temperature rapidly
goes beyond the ranges of its constituent materials.

The present
experimental setup pursues the technique used by Mourgues
et al.50 The experiments elucidated the
pool boiling of CNT and GNP nanofluids. The dispersion of CNT and
GNP was performed in DW at different concentrations (0.01, 0.05, 0.1%). Figure 10 displays the results
obtained experimentally for heat flux versus superheat temperature
for CNT, GNP, and GNP–PEG nanofluids at different weight fractions.
As shown in Figure 10, graphene nanofluids and the boiling heat transfer performance of
CNT are higher compared with DW for all concentrations. The critical
heat flux of GNP–PEG was amended by 72% over DW at the maximum
level (0.1 wt % GNP–PEG). As the concentration increased (for
raw GNP and functionalized GNP with PEG), the boiling heat transfer
performance of GNP nanofluids increases. However, the CHF of CNT nanofluid
decreases at the concentrations from 0.01 to 0.1 wt %. At the same
superheat temperature, heat flux increases for GNP and CNT nanofluids
is more than DW, in particular, for functionalized GNP nanofluids.
Additionally, at the same concentration, the CHF of the CNT and GNP
nanofluids was less than functionalized GNP nanofluids, and the CHF
of the CNT nanofluids was less than GNP nanofluids.

Figure 10 Heat flux in boiling
conditions versus superheat temperature and
CHF values of nanofluids.

In Figure 11, the
pool BHTC of CNT and GNP nanofluids is shown versus heat flux experimentally
quantified at various particle mass concentrations. With the growth
of the heat flux in the boiling surface, the HTC ascended considerably.
It is conjectured that a growth of heat flux amends the rate heat
transfer to the surface and bubble formation. Therefore, the bubble
interaction, local agitation, and micro/macro convection streams surrounding
the bubbles are intensified. Increase in the weight concentration
of GNP nanofluids improves the HTC while the increase rate for the
HTC in the low heat flux area was smaller than the high and moderate
heat flux areas. For CNT, the HTC decreased as weight concentration
was increased. On the other hand, the HTC for pristine GNP nanofluids
is more compared with DW. This may be because of the Brownian motion
of GNP inside the bulk of the nanofluids, the internal thermal conductivity
of the GNP nanofluids, and thermal diffusion from the surface to the
bulk of the nanofluids. With the growth of heat flux, the gap between
the HTC of GNP/DW nanofluids was increased as DW and noncovalent nanofluid
(Figure 11).

Figure 11 Heat transfer
coefficient vs heat flux and critical heat flux values
of nanofluids.

Obviously, free convection before
the CHF is considered as the
major mechanism in pool boiling heat transfer. A fluid circulates
in a closed loop without an external load or any pump.12 The findings proved that the pool BHTC of noncovalent
nanofluids and DW is less than covalent nanofluids. Furthermore, the
functional group added to the graphene surface and functionalization
method affected the BHTC, which was in consistent with our results.12 Also, consistent with the presented results
(Figure 11), the noncovalent
nanofluids (CNT and GNP nanofluids) showed a smaller increase or lower
pool boiling heat transfer than DW.

The formation of a thin
layer and CNT deposition on the heater
surface are the major cause of reduction of HTC. However, GNP deposition
on the heater surface increased the nucleation active site.

Figure 12 shows
the enhancement of the ratio of nanofluid CHF to the CHF of base fluid
(DW) as a function of concentrations. This figure demonstrates that
the CHF of all nanofluids studied is higher compared with the base
fluid. The CHF of GNP and GNP–PEG nanofluids increases with
concentration while the CHF of CNT-based nanofluid decreases with
increasing concentrations beyond 0.01 wt %. This implies that the
CHF is strongly affected by nanoparticle concentration, nanoparticle
type, and functionalization. These observations are consistent with
previous results on the CHF for GNP and CNT nanofluids.26,50,57,58 Enhancement of the CHF is greatest for the GNP nanofluid. The maximum
value of CHF for nanofluids was 72% higher in comparison to DW, and
a maximum CHF ratio of 1.56 was at 0.1 wt %. GNP–PEG and maximum CHF for CNT-
and GNP-based nanofluids were 20% (at 0.01 wt %) and 55% (at 0.1 wt
%), respectively. For covalent nanofluids, the increase in the CHF
could be attributed to a reduction in heat resistance because no nanoparticle
deposition was seen on the surface of the heater.

Figure 12 CHF enhancement defined
as the ratio of CHF nanofluids compared
to CHF basefluid.

In Figure 13, the
present experimental data for the CHF for different nanofluids versus
concentration are compared with the model of Kandlikar.16 Kandlikar developed a model to estimate the
CHF for the saturated pool boiling of pure liquids such as nonhydrodynamic
and the hydrodynamic impacts, as well as the orientation of the heater
surface. Kandlikar presumed that the onset of CHF is postponed by
a dynamic receding contact angle. Figure 13 shows that the measured CHF is consistent
with the Kandlikar correlation. The deviation of the experimental
data with the Kandlikar equation was on average 15% for CNT nanofluids,
2% for graphene nanofluids, and 7.8% for PEG–graphene nanofluids.

Figure 13 Comparison
of the measured values of CHF at various concentrations
with the predictions of Kandlikar for (a) CNT, (b) GNP, and (c) GNP–PEG
nanofluids.

5 Conclusions
An experimental study on pool boiling heat transfer for pristine
and functionalized GNP and raw CNT nanofluids was conducted under
atmospheric pressure. Nanofluids were generated by the addition of
GNP, functionalized GNP with PEG (GNP–PEG), and CNT to DW.
The nanoparticle weight concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 wt %
were used in these experiments.

It was found that the CHF and
the HTC increased for all nanofluid
samples than the DW. With the increase in concentration beyond 0.01
wt %, the HTC of CNT nanofluids decreased, while the HTC of the GNP
and GNP–PEG nanofluids increased monotonically with solid concentration.
The nanofluid generated by GNP–PEG (0.1 wt %) was the best
test sample as it was very stable (over 90 days), and its CHF value
and thermal conductivity were the highest of all samples studied and
showed, respectively, 72 and 20% enhancement compared to DW. However,
the present study showed that the thermal conductivity and functionalization
method (noncovalent and covalent) had a direct effect on the HTC and
CHF of nanofluids.
