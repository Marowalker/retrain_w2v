==== Body
Due to a publishing process
error, Figure 2 in
the above titled paper was not represented
correctly. In the published article the right side of Figure 2 is cut off, which makes it
impossible to see the scalebar on Figure 2e and 2f. Figure 2g was removed completely.
The correct Figure 2 is displayed below.

Figure 2 Characterization of organized films of quantum dots: (a)
low-angle
XRD patterns show an intensity decrease in the peaks associated with
arrangement of quantum dots with a decrease of drying time (for convenience,
XRD patterns are shifted: 300 s, 7000 counts; 110 s, 3000 counts;
50 s, 2000 counts). Inset: intensity of the XRD peaks vs peak position
(dots) and exponential decay fitting (dashed lines). (b) XRD spectra
(20–50°) of the samples show similar intensities of fcc
PbS peaks (111), (200), and (220) at different drying times. (c) Illustration
of the decrease of the third peak at 5.24° (presented in (a))
located at ∼5.2°, with decrease of the drying time. (d)
Dependence of this third peak on the drying time. (e) SEM image of
the sample dried for 300 s, showing formation of the superlattices
in the form of flakes randomly oriented in the planes perpendicular
to the sample surface. (f) SEM image of the same sample taken at higher
magnification. (g) PL spectra of the PbS films show no difference
in the position and shape of the PL with decreasing drying time and
∼100 nm shift compared to that of the initial solution.
