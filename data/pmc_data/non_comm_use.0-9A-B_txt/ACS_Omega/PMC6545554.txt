Petroleum generation–expulsion
thermal simulation experiments
on a low-maturity type I source rock were carried out. The composition
of hydrocarbons and heteroatom-containing compounds in both expelled
and residual oils was characterized by electrospray ionization Fourier
transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry. A thorough analysis of fractionation effects was presented
between expelled and residual oils. The oil composition strongly depended
on the pyrolysis temperature. A significant difference in the molecular
composition was found between expelled and residual oils at various
pyrolysis temperatures. The difference in maturity for expelled and
residual oils could be revealed clearly by the difference in the molecular
composition of heteroatom-containing compounds. Carboxylic acids in
the residual oil cracked quickly with the pyrolysis temperature above
350 °C (% Ro = 1.0) but part of them would survive if they were
expelled out of the source rock timely. The variations between the
relative abundance of oxygen compounds and nitrogen compounds indicated
that the thermostability of oxygen-containing nitrogen compounds was
lower than that of neutral nitrogen compounds. The variation trends
in double bond equivalents and carbon number distributions of O1, O2, and N1 class species were similar.
The aromaticity of heteroatom-containing polar species increased with
maturity.

Introduction
Thermal simulation
is an effective method to study the petroleum
generation and expulsion process and its mechanism.1 Numerous studies have been conducted with an emphasis on
the kinetics of oil cracking,2 the mechanism
of gas generation or the thermal stability of crude oils,3−9 and oil–expulsion efficiency.1 It has been recognized in oil shale retorting and natural petroleum
generation that oil generation is a simultaneous two-step process,
that is, kerogen–bitumen–oil.10,11 High molecular weight hydrocarbons and heteroatom-containing compounds
were transformed progressively into low molecular weight compounds
(condensate and gas) and pyrobitumen during oil cracking.7 However, the effects of hydrocarbon generation–expulsion
from source rocks on the molecular composition of petroleum are still
not well characterized, especially for heteroatom-containing polar
compounds in the petroleum generation–expulsion thermal simulation
process.

Petroleum generation–expulsion thermal simulation
experiments
have been carried out in a semi-closed simulation system1,12−14 to study the petroleum generation–expulsion
efficiency under geological conditions. The simulation experimental
system can be used to reveal the characteristics of petroleum generation
and expulsion under geological conditions, such as overburden pressure,
temperature, and fluid pressure. The system can objectively reflect
the characteristics and controlling factors of hydrocarbon generation–expulsion
in the thermal evolution of source rocks.15 Both the residual and expelled oils can be obtained through the
system.

Electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier transform ion
cyclotron resonance
mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) enabled the detailed analysis of heteroatom-containing
polar compounds in crude oil and rock extracts.16−18 Molecular transformation
of crude oil in the confined gold-tube pyrolysis system has been well
characterized.19 In this study, hydrocarbon
generation–expulsion thermal simulation experiment was conducted
on a lacustrine source rock of type I oil-prone kerogen with low maturity
and high total organic carbon (TOC) content. Gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) and negative-ion ESI FT-ICR MS were used to investigate
molecular compositional changes during the hydrocarbon generation–expulsion
process.

Results and Discussion
Yields and Saturates, Aromatics, Resins,
and Asphaltenes (SARA)
Composition of Expelled and Residual Oils
The total yields
of expelled and residual oils are shown in Table 1. % Ro was used to show the thermal maturities
at various pyrolysis temperatures. Total oil yields increased with
% Ro in the range of 0.7–1.6 and reach a maximum value at a
% Ro value of 1.6 and decreased at higher maturity. Most oils were
not expelled when % Ro ≤ 1.6. With the increase of % Ro, the
percentage of expelled oil on the total oil reached a maximum value
of 75.7% at % Ro 2.7, whereas the amount of residual oil decreased
due to the expulsion, secondary cracking into gas, and the carbonization
of heavy components.

The weight distribution
for SARA fractions of expelled and residual
oils at various pyrolysis temperatures was shown in Table 2. The percent of saturates in
both expelled and residual oils accounted for more than 43 wt % at
400 °C (corresponding to % Ro 1.6), then decreased quickly at
higher maturity. The percent of aromatics in expelled oil kept increasing,
whereas resins roughly kept decreasing.

Characterization of Oils by GC-MS
Figure 1 shows the total ion chromatograms
(TICs) of (a) residual oils and (b) expelled oils at various pyrolysis
temperatures. Although most of the light hydrocarbons were evaporated
during experiments, fractionation effects can be presented between
expelled and residual oils. The TIC of the 300 °C residual oil
showed a bimodal distribution, in which long chain normal alkanes
were abundant with an odd–even predominance and the most abundant
peak was phytane. This implies that the shale was derived from an
anoxic lacustrine environment with relatively low maturity. However,
the expelled oil showed a normal distribution of n-alkanes. Phytane was also most abundant in the 300 °C expelled
oil but no odd–even predominance of n-alkanes
was observed. The TICs of residual and expelled oil from 350 °C
were similar with those from 300 °C, except for the ratio of
pristane to phytane (Pr/Ph). Pr/Ph ratios of residual oils and expelled
oils at various pyrolysis temperatures were as follows: 0.6:0.2, 1.4:1.6,
1.9:1.8, 1.9:0.8, and 0.6:0.7. However, it is meaningless in both
residual oils and expelled oils above 400 (Ro 1.6) as shown in Figure 1. At the pyrolysis
temperature of 400 °C, normal alkanes were dominant in the saturates,
whereas isoprenoid alkanes and hopanes almost disappeared. No odd–even
predominance of n-alkanes was observed for residual
oils or expelled oils. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as phenanthrenes,
pyrenes, chrysene, and their alkyl-substituted homologs became dominant
with the pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C. The carbon number of
alkyl chains attached to the aromatic core decreased with the increase
in the pyrolysis temperature. The compositional variation trend in
residual oils was similar to that in expelled oils with the increase
of the pyrolysis temperature, although there are significant differences
in composition between residual and expelled oils. Expelled oils exhibited
lower maturity than that of the corresponding residual oils.

at various pyrolysis temperatures. (Phe: phenanthrene; P: pyrene;
BP: benzopyrene; C: chrysene; Pr: pristane; Ph: phytane). The values

Molecular Compositions of Heteroatom-Containing Class Species
in Residual and Expelled Oils
Broadband (m/z 200–600) negative-ion ESI FT-ICR mass
spectra of residual and expelled oils at various pyrolysis temperatures
are shown in Figure 2. Mass peaks with higher relative abundance in the oils at the simulation
temperature of 300 °C were corresponding to fatty acids that
have an even carbon number predominance. A C32H54O2 compound with the double bond equivalents (DBE) value
of 6 in the residual oil was inferred as hopanoic acid. The molecular
composition of 350 °C residual and expelled oils was very close
to each other and both have a higher relative abundance of fatty acids.
Mass spectra of the residual oil at 400 °C were quite different
from the corresponding expelled oil. The molecular composition of
the 400 °C expelled oil was similar to those of the residual
and expelled oils at 350 °C. However, the relative abundance
of fatty acids in the 400 °C residual oil decreased more significantly.
The highest mass peak in the mass spectrum of the residual oil was
the internal standard (stearic acid-d35), which exhibits much lower relative abundance in other mass spectra.
This indicates that most carboxylic acids cracked at a higher temperature
(e.g., 400 °C, % Ro = 1.6), whereas the expelled oils should
have experienced less severe thermal alteration because they could
escape the hot reactor when they were expelled. The mass peaks with
higher relative abundance were neutral nitrogen compounds in the 450
°C expelled oil. The mass peaks with higher relative abundance
are neutral nitrogen compounds in the 450 and 500 °C expelled
oil, such as benzocarbazoles, dibenzocarbazoles, and benzonaphthocarbazoles.
Carboxylic acids were also presented in the 450 and 500 °C residual
oils, in which C16 and C18 fatty acids were
dominant. These compounds were more likely contaminants from the experimental
process instead of pyrolysis products. However, no corresponding odd-over-even
predominance was seen in the alkane distributions according to GC-MS
analyses (Figure 1),
indicating that the contribution of fatty acids to the production
of alkanes is limited. The contribution from the cracking of alkyl
side chain of N1, N1Ox, and O1 species to the production of alkanes is
nonnegligible.

Figure 2 Broadband (m/z 200–600)
negative-ion ESI FT-ICR mass spectra of (a) residual oils and (b)
expelled oils at various pyrolysis temperatures. (IS: stearic acid-d35; FA: fatty acid; the values in the brackets
are % Ro.).

The relative abundance
of heteroatom class species in residual
and expelled oils at different pyrolysis temperatures are shown in Figure 3. A total of 16 class
species were assigned. The O2, O1, and N1 class species by negative-ion ESI FT-ICR MS generally corresponded
to carboxylic acids, phenols, and carbazoles, respectively.19 With the increase of the pyrolysis temperature,
carboxylic acids cracked quickly, resulting in the quick decrease
of O2 species, except for the contaminants of C16 and C18 fatty acids in residual oils at high temperatures.
The relative abundance of nitrogen-containing species increased largely
with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature, supposedly because
of the joint control by the generation of nitrogen compounds and the
decomposition of acids. The increase in the relative abundance of
O1 class species in expelled oils of 450 and 500 °C
indicated that the decomposition of O2 was much faster
than that of O1 class species (Figure 3) and the decomposition of O1 was
faster than that of N1 class species. In other words, O1 class species had higher thermostability than O2 class species, such as fatty acids, but lower thermostability than
N1 class species, such as carbazoles. Additionally, the
decrease in the relative abundance of oxygen-containing compounds,
as well as oxynitrides and the increase in the relative abundance
of neutral nitrogen compounds, implied that the thermostability of
oxygen-containing compounds as well as oxynitrides was lower than
that of neutral nitrogen compounds. As a result, the ratio of N1O1/N1 decreased gradually with the increase
of Ro (0.7–2.7%) in both residual and expelled oils. It may
be used as a potential maturity parameter for source rocks from low-maturity
stage to over-maturity stage.

DBE and carbon number distributions of O2 class species
in residual and expelled oils at various pyrolysis temperatures are
shown in Figure 4.
The size of point in each figure denoted the relative response to
the internal standard (stearic acid-d35), which was spiked into each sample to show the variations in the
relative concentration of various compounds. Mass peaks with higher
relative abundance in the residual and expelled oils at 300 °C
were fatty acids. Except for the contaminants of fatty acids with
low DBEs in residual oils at high temperatures, the aromaticity of
O2 class species increased with the increase of maturity,
implying that the O2 class species with high DBE may be
aromatic carboxylic acids, phenols, or ketones.

distribution of O2 class species
in (a) residual and (b) expelled oils at various pyrolysis temperatures.
The values in the brackets are % Ro.

The DBE and carbon number distributions of O1 class
species in residual and expelled oils at various pyrolysis temperatures
are shown in Figure 5. The O1 compound with DBE = 4 and carbon number of C28 in the residual oil of 300 °C and the expelled oil
of 350 °C, which showed very high relative abundance, should
be isoprenoidyl phenols.20 Isoprenoidyl
phenols were more unstable than normal alkyl phenols, which was consistent
with the previous results of crude oil pyrolyzed in the confined pyrolysis
system.19 With the increase of the pyrolysis
temperature, in general, carbon number ranges of alkyl phenols shifted
to a lower value, whereas average DBE values of O1 species
increased. In general, the O1 class species with higher
DBE values were abundant in the samples with higher maturity. Based
on the planar limits,21−23 these compounds were likely highly condensed phenolic
compounds or aromatic ketones. O1 class species with DBE
< 4 were likely alcohols or aliphatic ketones, which should be
the products from the decomposition of Ox or N1Ox species. Considering
that the DBE = 0 species (alcohols) were not detected, these O1 class species with DBE < 4 should be aliphatic ketones.
A standard compound, 2-heptanone, was proved to be ionized in the
negative-ion mode ESI with the presence of ammonium hydroxide.

DBE and carbon number distributions
of N1 class species
in residual and expelled oils at various pyrolysis temperatures are
shown in Figure 6.
The N1 series with DBE = 9 corresponded to carbazoles.
N1 class species in the 300 °C expelled oil was undetectable.
The carbon number of alkyl side chains in N1 class species
decreased with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, whereas the
DBE value of N1 species increased. This indicates that
the aromaticity of N1 species increased with increasing
maturity. Similar variations could also be observed in O2 and O1 class species (Figures 4 and 5). In general,
the variation trends in DBE and carbon number distributions of O2, O1, and N1 class species were similar,
which was consistent with the results of crude oil and its products
pyrolyzed in the confined pyrolysis system.19 The aromaticity of the polar heteroatom species increased with maturity.
The results were also consistent with those reported in the literature
with geological samples.16,17,24,25

Distribution of Hydrocarbon
Generation–Expulsion from
Source Rocks
The variation trend between the hydrocarbon
expulsion efficiency of the source rock and thermal evolution degree
was plotted elsewhere.1 The results in
the literature1 showed that the hydrocarbon
expulsion efficiency of type I source rock is usually lower than 20%
at a low-maturity stage, 20–50% at the principal oil-generation
stage (Ro = 0.8–1.3%) and 50–90% at the high-maturity
stage (Ro = 1.3–2.0%). Based on the results of GC-MS and ESI
FT-ICR MS, the distribution of hydrocarbon generation–expulsion
from source rocks on the molecular level were demonstrated. At a low-maturity
stage and the principal oil-generation stage, the main nonpolar components
of residual and expelled oils were normal alkanes, pristane, and phytane.
The polar molecules were mainly carboxylic acids with even carbon
number predominance. At a high-maturity stage, the main nonpolar components
of residual and expelled oils were normal alkanes and aromatics. The
polar molecules in expelled oil were mainly carboxylic acids. The
polar molecules in residual oil were mainly N1, N1Ox, and Ox species. At the over mature stage, the main nonpolar components
of residual and expelled oils were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.
The polar molecules were mainly N1, N1Ox, and Ox species
with higher DBE and shorter alkyl side chains. The compositional differences
between residual oils and expelled oils at identical temperatures
could be attributed to both the geological chromatography-like effect26 and maturity differences between residual oils
and expelled oils. The geological chromatography effect could lead
to compositional differences between residual oils and expelled oils.
The compounds with higher polarity were preferentially retained in
the source rock as residual oil, whereas those with lower polarity
were preferentially expelled from the source rock as expelled oil.
Based on the results and advancements in petrochemistry by ESI FT-ICR
MS, fractionation of petroleum fractions occurs in this sequence:
asphaltenes > polars, resins > aromatics > alkanes; the latter
being
preferentially expelled relative to the former groups.27 Furthermore, in this semi-closed system, there
were significant differences in maturity between residual oils and
expelled oils because the hydrocarbons generated earlier were expelled
out of the heating system and avoided further cracking.

Conclusions
Petroleum generation–expulsion simulation experiments were
conducted on a low mature lacustrine shale source rock. A thorough
analysis of fractionation effects was presented between expelled and
residual oils. Significant compositional differences were found between
residual oils and expelled oils. The expelled oils usually showed
lower polarity and maturity. The difference in maturity for expelled
and residual oils could be revealed clearly by the difference in the
molecular composition of hydrocarbons and heteroatom-containing compounds.
Most oils were not expelled when the pyrolysis temperature was ≤400
°C. In general, the variations in molecular composition with
the increase of the pyrolysis temperature in residual oil were similar
to that in expelled oil. The contribution of fatty acids to the production
of alkanes was limited. The contribution from the cracking of the
alkyl side chain of N1, N1Ox, and O1 species to the production of alkanes was
nonnegligible. The variation trends in DBE and carbon number distributions
of O1, O2, and N1 class species with
maturity were similar, which was consistent with the results of crude
oil and its products pyrolyzed in the confined pyrolysis system.

Experimental
Section
Source Rock Sample
The source rock sample used in the
simulation experiment was a grayish black shale, which was collected
from Qikou Sag of Bohai Bay Basin, China. The shale was of lacustrine
origin and low maturity (TOC = 7.71%, % Ro = 0.67%, Tmax = 438 °C, S0 = 0.24
mg/g, S1 = 0.95 mg/g, S2 = 52.01 mg/g, (S1 + S2) = 52.96 mg/g, HI = 675 mg/g). Based on the
high HI index and maceral compositions, the organic type of the source
rock was verified as type I (sapropel type).

Petroleum Generation–Expulsion
Thermal Simulation Experiment
To make the experimental conditions
similar to the real hydrocarbon
generation–expulsion process of source rocks under geological
conditions, the experiment was optimized in operating parameters including
temperature, time, water addition, pore fluid pressure, and hydrocarbon
generation space.1 The simulation experiments
were carried out at five temperature/pressure conditions: 300 °C/40
MPa, 350 °C/45 MPa, 400 °C/50 MPa, 450 °C/55 MPa, and
500 °C/60 Mpa, respectively. The pressure value is the upper
limit of the pressure in the reactor, if the fluid pressure in the
reactor increases higher than this value, the valve of the reactor
could open to allow the generated hydrocarbons partially expelled.
Each experiment at a certain temperature point was conducted individually.
A portion of 150–200 g shale particle with overflowing water
was compacted to the cylindrical core forced by mechanical pressure,
such as lithostatic pressure. Excess water was expelled in the compacting
process. Then the core was loaded in the high-pressure reactor. It
was heated to the temperature point from room temperature with a heating
rate of 50 °C/h. The reactor was held at the pyrolysis temperature
for 24 h and then cooled to the corresponding formation expulsion
temperature. The simulation temperature of 300, 350, 400, 450, and
500 °C were corresponding to the formation of expulsion temperatures
of 105, 110, 115, 120, and 130 °C, respectively. Vitrinite reflectance
values (% Ro) were measured to show the thermal maturities at various
pyrolysis temperatures.

After the simulation experiment, the
expelled oil, including expelled liquid hydrocarbon in the reactor
and cold trap, was collected and weighed. The residual oil was extracted
from the source rock powder by chloroform for 72 h in a Soxhlet. The
yields of the expelled and residual oils are listed in Table 1. Expelled and residual oils
were then fractionated into saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes
(SARA) fractions by column chromatography.

GC-MS Analysis
An Agilent 5975C GC-MS equipped with
an HP-5MS (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) fused-silica
capillary column was used for the analysis of the expelled and residual
oils. The GC injector was maintained at 300 °C in the splitless
mode. The oven temperature was held at 50 °C for 1 min, increased
to 120 °C at 20 °C/min, increased to 240 °C at 4 °C/min,
and then increased to 310 °C at 3 °C/min and held constant
at 310 °C for 30 min. The MS run with a 70 eV electron impact
source. The mass scan range was from 35 to 450 Da with a 1 s interval.

Negative-Ion ESI FT-ICR MS Analysis
The sample preparation
procedure for ESI FT-ICR MS analysis has been described elsewhere.19,20 Samples were dissolved in toluene and diluted to 0.2 mg/mL with
toluene/methanol (1:3, v/v). The same amount of stearic acid-d35 was spiked in each sample as an internal
standard to quantify the relative concentration among the samples.
MS analyses were performed using a Bruker apex-ultra 9.4 T FT-ICR
MS. The diluted samples were injected into the spray needle with a
syringe pump at a rate of 180 μL/h. The operating conditions
for the negative-ion mode were: 3.5 kV spray shield voltage; 4.0 kV
capillary column introduction voltage; and −320 V capillary
column end voltage. Optimized mass for the quadrupole was 200 Da.
An argon-filled hexapole collision pool was operated at 5 MHz and
600 Vp-p radio frequency (RF) amplitude, in which ions were accumulated
for 0.1 s. The delay was generally set to 1.1 ms to transfer the ions
to the ICR cell by the electrostatic focusing of transfer optics.
The RF excitation was attenuated at 13 dB and used to excite ions
over the range of 150–1000 Da. The data set size was set to
4 M words with a transient length of 2.3 s. Time-domain data sets
of 64 acquisitions were co-added. Mass calibration and the details
of data processing have been described elsewhere.16,28
