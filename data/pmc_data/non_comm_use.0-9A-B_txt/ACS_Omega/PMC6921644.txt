The biological production of two-carbon compounds (ethylene
glycol
(EG) and glycolate) has been studied for the sustainable supply of
the compounds to the polymer, cosmetic, textile, and medical industries.
Here, we demonstrated the bioconversion of xylose to either ethylene
glycol (EG) or glycolate using engineered Corynebacterium
glutamicum, a well-known industrial amino acid producer.
A synthetic ribulose 1-phosphate (Ru1P) pathway involving heterologous d-tagatose 3-epimerase and l-fuculose kinase/aldolase
reactions was introduced in C. glutamicum. Subsequently, heterologous expression of Escherichia
coli YqhD reductase with the synthetic Ru1P pathway
led to ethylene glycol production from xylose. Additional pathway
engineering in C. glutamicum by mutating ald, which encodes an aldehyde dehydrogenase, abolished
the by-product formation of glycolate during xylose conversion to
EG at a yield of 0.75 mol per mol. In addition, the bioconversion
of xylose to glycolate was achieved, and the almost maximum molar
yield was 0.99 mol per mol xylose in C. glutamicum via the Ru1P pathway. Thus, the synthetic Ru1P pathway in C. glutamicum led bioconversion of xylose to either
ethylene glycol or glycolate with high molar yields.

Introduction
Ethylene glycol, a two-carbon diol compound,
can be commercially
produced from ethylene or CO in the petrochemical industry and is
used as a polymer precursor (i.e., polyethylene terephthalate) and
antifreezing agent. Glycolate, a two-carbon α-hydroxyl acid
with alcohol and carboxyl moieties, is chemically produced by energy-intensive
carbonylation of CO/H2-derived formaldehyde, enzymatic
oxidation of ethylene glycol, or hydrolyzation of glycolonitrile.
Glycolate is widely used as a skin care product in the cosmetic industry,
a rinsing agent in the textile industry, and as a precursor for biopolymers,
e.g., poly(lactate-co-glycolate)1 or glycolate-based polyester.2 Although current chemical processes for the two-carbon chemicals
are cheap and fast, low selectivity limits the energy-saving process.
Thus, a biological process with high selectivity may be an alternative
environmentally friendly process with a low energy demand. It is necessary
to develop efficient microbial cell factories that use renewable carbon
sources and produce target chemicals with a high yield.3−5 Glucose and xylose are the most abundant sugars from lignocellulosic
materials that are composed of cellulose, hemicellulose (mostly xylan),
and lignin.

Metabolic engineering of microbial strains has been
studied to
supply sustainable ethylene glycol or glycolate from glucose and xylose.
In Escherichia coli, a synthetic pathway
for either ethylene glycol or glycolate production from xylose via
synthetic xylose 1-phosphate has been designed by expressing xylulose
1-phosphate aldolase, resulting in 2.1 g/L ethylene glycol at a yield
of 0.47 mol/mol or 4.3 g/L glycolate at a yield of 0.9 mol/mol, respectively.6 Ethylene glycol and glycolate were co-produced
by the engineered E. coli strains,
with a yield of 0.93 mol/mol as two-carbon compounds. By optimizing
the E. coli strain with FucO reductase,
20 g/L of ethylene glycol was only produced with 0.37 g/(L h) at a
molar yield of 0.94 mol/mol.7

Another
synthetic ribulose 1-phosphate (Ru1P) pathway has been
used to produce glycolate from xylose, as a sole source of carbon,
via heterologous d-tagatose 3-epimerase and l-fuculose
kinase/aldolase reactions, resulting in either 40 g/L ethylene glycol
or 44 g/L glycolate from 100 g/L xylose.8 Furthermore, pathway engineering in the glyoxylate shunt resulted
in 40 g/L glycolate from 65 g/L xylose, with a yield of 0.63 g/g (or
1.21 mol/mol). Recently, the Dahms pathway, which is an oxidative
xylose degradation pathway via xylonolactone and xylonite intermediates,
has been adopted to convert xylose to ethylene glycol, with a yield
of 0.29 g/g (or 0.7 mol/mol),9 and glycolate,
with a yield of 0.46 g/g (or 0.91).10,11 In silico
simulation and synthetic small rRNA-based metabolic engineering of E. coli have increased the titer, productivity, and
yield of a product on xylose (108.2 g/L; 0.36 g/g; 2.25 g/L/h).12 In addition, high-level production of 65.5 g/L
glycolate and 10.6 g/L acetate in a fed-batch culture was achieved
from 0.77 g/g glucose by balancing the TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt.13 Besides sole bioconversion from xylose in E. coli, bioconversion of xylose to glycolate via
the Dahms pathway has been combined to produce poly(lactate-co-glycolate) and its copolymers,1 and glucose has been redirected to produce poly(lactate-co-glycolate-co-3-hydroxybutyrate) via
the glyoxylate shunt and glyoxylate reductase.14

Corynebacterium glutamicum is a
well-known industrial producer of amino acids (e.g., 2 200 000
tons l-lysine per year). Recently, metabolically engineered C. glutamicum was grown on alternative carbon sources
like xylose15−17 to produce industrially relevant chemicals.4,18,19 Previously, ethylene glycol (3.5
g/L) has been produced from glucose at a yield of 0.25 mol/mol (or
0.10 g/g) via the serine biosynthetic pathway using engineered C. glutamicum.20 In addition,
5.3 g/L glycolate (a yield of 0.18 g/g [0.43 mol/mol]), from a mixture
of glucose and acetate, has been produced in engineered C. glutamicum.21 Besides
ethylene glycol and glycolate production, C. glutamicum harboring a high-copy number plasmid with xdh encoding
xylose dehydrogenase showed a high conversion rate of xylonate from
xylose at 0.75 g/(L h).22 Xylonate (6.23
g/L) from 20 g/L xylan has also been reported to be produced in C. glutamicum.23 The use
of C. glutamicum ΔiolR (gene for the transcriptional repressor IolR) resulted in a high
level of xylonate production at a molar yield of 1.0 and volumetric
productivity of 3.98 g/(L h).24 However,
there are no reports on the conversion of xylose to ethylene glycol
and glycolate using C. glutamicum via
a synthetic Ru1P pathway or other xylose-utilizing pathways.

In this study, we engineered a C. glutamicum strain capable of converting xylose to either ethylene glycol at
a yield of 0.75 mol/mol (0.31 g/g) or glycolate at a yield of 0.99
mol/mol (0.51 g/g) via the synthetic Ru1P pathway. To increase productivity,
a xylose uptake IolT transporter was expressed in the engineered C. glutamicum. In addition, to eliminate the by-product
(glycolate) for the sole production of ethylene glycol, the native ald gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase was manipulated
using CRISPR-Cas12a to have a nonsense mutation. Furthermore, fed-batch
fermentation was conducted to produce either ethylene glycol or glycolate
from xylose to improve the titer and demonstrate the bioconversion
of xylose using the engineered C. glutamicum strains.

Results and Discussion
Synthetic Pathway Design for Ethylene Glycol and Glycolate from
Xylose in C. glutamicum
The
wild-type (WT) C. glutamicum expressing
a heterologous xylose isomerase is capable of using xylose as the
sole carbon source.15 For this reason,
the xylB encoding xylulose kinase was deleted and C. glutamicum ΔxylB (SL-1)
was used as the parental host strain to convert xylose to either ethylene
glycol or glycolate via synthetic glycolate pathways (Figure 1). No xylose consumption was
exhibited by SL-1 (data not shown). The synthetic ethylene glycol
and glycolate pathways via Ru1P consist of 4 common enzymatic steps
involving xylose isomerase (I; xylA from E. coli), d-tagatose 3-epimerase (E; dte from P. cichorii), l-fuculose kinase (K; fucK from E. coli), l-fuculose aldolase (A; fucA from E. coli), and a
target-specific enzymatic reaction as either reduction by an aldehyde
reductase (R; yqhD from E. coli, O; fucO from E. coli) for ethylene glycol or oxidation by an aldehyde dehydrogenase (D; aldA from E. coli) for glycolate.
Both pathways were designed to convert xylose to the target product
with a theoretical molar yield of 1 mol/mol (C-mole product/C-mole
substrate).

Figure 1 Bioconversion of xylose to ethylene glycol and glycolate using
engineered C. glutamicum. (A) Xylose
was converted to either ethylene glycol or glycolate via synthetic
metabolic pathways in C. glutamicum. The SL-1 strain (C. glutamicum ΔxylB [encoding xylulose kinase]) was used as the parental
strain for the bioconversion. To convert xylose to either ethylene
glycol or glycolate, five enzymatic steps (shown in colored arrows)
were used by expressing genes encoding xylose isomerase (xylA) from E. coli, d-tagatose
3-epimerase (dte) from P. cichorii, l-fuculokinase (fucK) from E. coli, l-fuculose phosphate aldolase (fucA) from E. coli, aldehyde
dehydrogenase (aldA) from E. coli, and aldehyde reductase (yqhD) from E. coli in SL-1. Red “X” represents

Bioconversion of Xylose as the Sole Carbon to Either Ethylene
Glycol or Glycolate
To produce ethylene glycol from xylose,
the plasmid pIEAKR, pIEKAR, pIEAOK, or pIEKAO was transformed into
SL-1. SL-1 strains harboring the plasmid were cultivated with 2% (w/v)
xylose as the sole carbon source. As a result, no ethylene glycol
was detected in the medium. Because of no xylose consumption, the
strains were not able to grow from xylose. This could be due to inadequate
ATP supply and imbalance of NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ from the catabolic metabolism
of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is a product of l-fuculose phosphate aldolase (FucA; Figure 2A). In addition, the plasmid with pIEKAD
(or pIEAKD) for the synthetic glycolate pathway was transformed into
SL-1. SL-1 pIEKAD or pIEAKD were cultivated with 2% (w/v) xylose as
the sole carbon source. As a result, 2.4 g/L glycolate was obtained
from 5.4 g/L xylose using both strains; the final OD600 values were 3.8 ± 0.1 or 3.6 ± 0.1 (Figure 2B). The conversion yields were less than
0.47 g/g, and only 30% initial xylose was used for growth and glycolate
conversion. Unlike recombinant E. coli harboring the synthetic Ru1P pathway,8 SL-1 pIEKAD or SL-1 pIEAKD did not completely convert xylose to
glycolate when xylose was provided as the sole carbon source for 120
h. In these C. glutamicum strains,
only small fractions of xylose were metabolized and converted to either
ethylene glycol or glycolate. In addition, the lower cell growth rates
and xylose conversions were observed in ethylene glycol-producing
strains than in glycolate-producing strains. This could be due to
the fact that strain SL-1 did not provide enough chemical reducing
power for xylose conversion in the presence of only xylose as the
sole carbon.

concentrations [upper row], xylose (solid symbol; solid line) and

in A), SL-1 pIEKAR (blue triangle in A), SL-1 pIEAKD (red circle in

as the sole carbon source [left panel], a mixture of xylose (2% wt/vol)
and glucose (0.5% wt/vol) [middle panel], or a mixture of xylose (2%
wt/vol) and glucose (2% wt/vol) [right panel] in CgXII medium was
used. The data represent mean values of triplicate cultivations, and
the error bars represent standard deviations. See Table 1 for the strains used.

Bioconversion of Xylose to Either Ethylene Glycol or Glycolate
with an Additional Carbon Source
To increase the bioconversion
capability, an additional 0.5% (w/v) glucose or 2% (w/v) glucose was
supplemented for the cell growth with the supply of ATP and recycling
of NA(P)D+. Although the recombinants (SL-1 pIEARK and
SL-1 pIEKAR) with 0.5% (w/v) glucose showed a final OD600 of 30.0 ± 0.8 and 31.3 ± 0.8, respectively, less than
0.2 g/L ethylene glycol production was observed. Interestingly, 10.78
g/L glycolate (SL-1 pIEARK) and 10.97 g/L glycolate (SL-1 pIEKAR)
were produced as by-products. Because the final step for ethylene
glycol conversion requires NADPH reduction, 2% glucose was supplied
along with 2% xylose for better cell growth and reducing potential.
Then, the recombinants (SL-1 pIEARK and SL-1 pIEKAR) with 2% (w/v)
glucose attained a final OD600 of 49.5 ± 0.1 and 55.4
± 0.3, respectively. After glucose was completely depleted, SL-1
harboring either pIEARK or SL-1 pIEKAR produced similar levels of
ethylene glycol (4.7 ± 0.1 g/L ethylene glycol from 19.7 ±
0.1 g/L xylose in 60 h with a yield of 0.25 g/g and 0.59 mol/mol)
(Figure 2A). Since
ethylene glycol has not been produced yet from glucose in C. glutamicum,(20) we believed
that ethylene glycol was converted from xylose in a mixture of glucose
and xylose as carbon sources.

Under these conditions, undesired
glycolate production, caused by native aldehyde dehydrogenase activity,
was dramatically reduced by producing ethylene glycol converted from
glycolaldehyde as the same precursor. Particularly, overexpression
of yqhD encoding a major glycolaldehyde reductase
in E. coli resulted in a favorable
reaction against native aldehyde dehydrogenase in C.
glutamicum. We also tested another aldehyde reductase
(fucO encoding lactaldehyde reductase from E. coli), but we did not observe enhanced ethylene
glycol production (Figure S2). However,
the overexpression of fucO contributed positively
to ethylene glycol production in E. coli via the synthetic Ru1P or xylulose 1-phosphate pathway.7,8 Although xylonate was not produced, xylitol (0.1 g/L at 60 h; 0.4
g/L at 120 h) was produced because of unspecific xylose reductase.
Nonetheless, to convert xylose to ethylene glycol, C. glutamicum could not provide a sufficient amount
of reduction equivalents in the presence of xylose as the sole carbon.

For glycolate production, the recombinants (SL-1 pIEKAD and SL-1
pIEAKD) with 0.5% (w/v) glucose attained a final OD600 of
24.8 ± 0.5 and 26.3 ± 0.8, respectively. After the glucose
was completely depleted, SL-1 pIEKAD produced 10.12 ± 0.1 g/L
glycolate from 19.5 ± 0.1 g/L xylose in 96 h, with a yield of
0.99 mol/mol (0.51 g/g; Figure 2B). Similarly, SL-1 pIEAKD produced 10.14 ± 0.1 g/L glycolate
from 20 g/L xylose, with a yield of 0.99 mol/mol (0.51 g/g).

Since glycolate has not been produced from glucose in C. glutamicum,21 we also
believed that glycolate was converted from xylose in a mixture of
glucose and xylose as carbon sources. Thus, the molar yields of the
recombinant C. glutamicum strains reached
the theoretical maximum value with the synthetic glycolate pathway,
although the 13C-labeled xylose could be fed for an accurate
calculation of the actual yield. To increase the glycolate production
rate, cell biomass was increased by cultivating the cells with 2%
(w/v) glucose (the final OD600 was 56.6 ± 1.4 and
57.3 ± 2.0 for SL-1 pIEKAD and SL-1 pIEAKD, respectively). However,
the production rate was not enhanced (0.12 g/(L h) at 76 h, 0.5% (w/v)
glucose and 2% (w/v) xylose; 0.13 g/(L h) at 76 h, 2% (w/v) glucose
and 2% (w/v) xylose). The molar yield of glycolate was decreased to
0.92 mol/mol (0.47 g/g). No xylonate was detected. This decrease was
due to the by-product formation of xylitol; 0.9 g/L xylitol was measured
when the cells were grown with 2% (w/v) glucose and 2% (w/v) xylose
when compared with 0.2 g/L xylitol from the cells grown with 0.5%
(w/v) glucose and 2% (w/v) xylose. Interestingly, SL-1 harboring the
empty vector with 2% (w/v) glucose and 2% (w/v) xylose also consumed
2.2 g/L xylose (14.9 mM) and produced 1.5 g/L (10.13 mM) xylitol.
Because the engineered C. glutamicum, exhibiting the Weimberg pathway, has been reported to accumulate
small amounts of xylitol when grown on a mixture of glucose and xylose,25 we assumed that C. glutamicum WT, under conditions in which xylose metabolism is not efficient,
could enable the oxidation of xylose to xylitol.

Pathway Engineering with an IolT Transporter for Ethylene Glycol
and Glycolate
To increase the conversion rate of either ethylene
glycol or glycolate, a metabolic engineering strategy to increase
the rate of xylose uptake should be considered. Deletion of the iolR gene in C. glutamicum with the xylose isomerase had improved xylose uptake and the cell
growth rate by 1.6-fold when compared with WT.26 In addition, the myo-inositol/proton symporter
IolT1 has been shown to contribute to faster xylose uptake and cell
growth. Therefore, we constructed the SL-1R strain (iolR::P9Ter) to derepress a iol gene cluster, including iolT1. To accelerate strain development, mutant strains
were constructed using CoryneCR12-STOP (Figure S2). Then, SL-1 and SL-1R strains were transformed with either
pIEARKT or pIEAKDT for ethylene glycol or glycolate, respectively
(Table 1).

As a result, the SL-1 pIEARKT strain only showed improved
ethylene
glycol production (5.7 g/L) at a molar yield of 0.69 mol/mol (0.29
g/g) when compared with the control (SL-1 pIEARK; 4.7 ± 0.1 g/L;
0.59 mol/mol [0.25 g/g]; Figure 3A). None of the SL-1R strains harboring pIEARK, pIEARKT,
pIEAKD, or pIEAKDT showed better performance than the control. Interestingly,
SL-1R yielded a significant amount of xylonate (5.6 g/L for SL-1R
pIEARKT and 10.17 g/L for SL-1R pIEAKDT), which lowered the production
titer and yield of ethylene glycol and glycolate (Figure 3A,B). This could result from
the de-depression of the iolG gene encoding for myo-inositol dehydrogenase. The finding was consistent with
that of a previous study in which C. glutamicum ΔiolR (the gene for the transcriptional repressor
IolR) accumulated high amounts of xylonate via the oxidation pathway
of xylose with native myo-inositol dehydrogenase
(IolG).24 Thus, faster xylose uptake rates
were achieved by a nonsense mutation in iolR and
overexpression of iolT1 in the SL-1R-derived strains
(Figure 3). However,
faster xylose uptakes were exhibited, and higher xylonate formation
was achieved. Since IolR has been predicted to regulate 14 genes including
the iolG and iolT1 genes,27 the de-regulation of the IolR regulons in the
SL-1R mutants must be followed, which remains unknown. Therefore,
the synthetic Ru1P pathway must be optimized and faster xylose consumption
and no xylonate formation should be considered to improve the production
titer and yield of either ethylene glycol or glycolate by deleting
the iolG gene.

pIEAKD (black square in A), SL-1 pIEAKDT (red circle in B), SL-1R

(2% wt/vol) and glucose (2% wt/vol). The data represent mean values
of triplicate cultivations, and the error bars represent standard
deviations. See Table 1 for the strains used.

Nonsense Mutation of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Reduced Glycolate
Production during Ethylene Glycol Production
To minimize
by-product formation and enhance ethylene glycol conversion, the SL-1
pIEARKT strain was further metabolically developed by inactivating
the gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald). We searched for a
major enzyme for Ald. The protein sequence identity between AldA in E. coli, which has been used for glycolate production
in this study, and the Ald encoded by ald (cg3096)
was 33%. In addition, Ald encoded by ald is capable
of oxidizing formaldehyde to formate.28 Thus, the SL-1A mutant was constructed by creating a nonsense mutation
in ald (ald::C49Ter; Table 1 and Figure S2). As a result, glycolate formation was completely eliminated in
the SL-1A pIEARKT strain during cell culture and xylose conversion
with 2% (w/v) glucose and 2% (w/v) xylose (Figure 4). Similarly, no glycolate production was
reported in E. coli ΔxylB ΔaldA.7 However, no significant increase in ethylene glycol conversion was
achieved in SL-1A pIEARKT (5.8 g/L ± 0.02 at a yield of 0.75
mol/mol (0.31 g/g)). Instead, ethylene glycol degradation was abolished,
and the final OD600 (44.0 ± 1.9) was slightly increased
in SL-1A pIEARKT when compared with that in SL-1 pIEARKT (41.3 ±
0.4). Besides the glycolate and ethylene glycol conversion, carbon
metabolism for glycolaldehyde in C. glutamicum is still unclear. A possible route could be related to the detoxification
of formaldehyde to formate.6

Optical densities at 600 nm (OD600; solid symbol; solid
line) and glucose (open symbol; dashed line) concentrations, xylose
(solid symbol; solid line) and ethylene glycol (open symbol; dashed
line) concentrations, and glycolate and xylonate (open symbol; dashed
line) concentrations in the medium were measured. C.
glutamicum SL-1 pIEARKT (black square) and SL-1A pIEARKT
(red circle) were cultivated in the CgXII medium with a mixture of
xylose (2% wt/vol) and glucose (2% wt/vol). The data represent mean
values of triplicate cultivations, and the error bars represent standard
deviations. See Table 1 for the strains used.

Fed-Batch Fermentation for Ethylene Glycol and Glycolate from
Xylose
The engineered C. glutamicum strain SL-1A pIEARKT for ethylene glycol resulted in 5.8 ±
0.02 g/L ethylene glycol from 18.6 ± 0.16 g/L xylose at a yield
of 0.75 mol/mol (0.31 g/g) in the flask culture. Also, SL-1 pIEAKD
produced 10.14 ± 0.1 g/L glycolate from 19.9 ± 0.06 g/L
xylose at a yield of 0.99 mol/mol (0.51 g/g) in the flask culture.
To obtain a higher production titer using the strains, fed-batch fermentation
was performed using 2% (w/v) glucose and 2% (w/v) xylose minimal medium
and the engineered C. glutamicum strains.
For the production of ethylene glycol, SL-1A pIEARKT was used, and
an OD600 of 58.3 at 16 h was attained after the glucose
was used completely (Figure 5A). No glycolate was detected in the flask culture. However,
no bioconversion of xylose to ethylene glycol was achieved in the
absence of glucose. Xylose was accumulated during the fed-batch culture,
and the titer of ethylene glycol was not increased after the glucose
was depleted. This could be due to the imbalance of NADPH regeneration
via DHAP as a three-carbon intermediate of xylose and no NADPH synthesis
in the pentose phosphate pathway from xylose (the xylB mutant). In the previous fed-batch fermentation, 108.18 g/L ethylene
glycol was produced from xylose via the modulated Dahms pathway using
the engineered E. coli (no xylA mutant), in which the NADPH pool could be balanced
with the production of ethylene glycol.12 Thus, it may be important to further engineer C.
glutamicum for recycling NADPH pools.

Figure 5 Fed-batch culture for
the bioconversion of ethylene glycol and
glycolate from xylose using recombinant C. glutamicum. (A) Growth profiles (square), glucose consumption (circle), xylose
consumption (triangle), and ethylene glycol production (diamond) are
shown for SL-1A pIEARKT in 2% (w/v) glucose and 2% (w/v) xylose in
CgXII minimal medium using fed-batch fermentation. (B) Growth profiles
(square), glucose consumption (circle), xylose consumption (triangle),
and glycolate production (diamond) are shown for SL-1 pIEAKD in 2%
(w/v) glucose and 2% (w/v) xylose in CgXII minimal medium using fed-batch
fermentation.

For glycolate production, the SL-1 pIEAKD strain
reached an OD600 of 56.5 at 24 h, when the glucose was
completely depleted
(Figure 5B). Then,
xylose was rapidly consumed and glycolate was produced (8.3 g/L at
36 h). The final OD600 was 56.2. Subsequently, four additional
xylose feedings were added to the fermenter, producing 24.1 g/L glycolate
with a yield of 0.48 g/g (0.94 mol/mol) at 144 h. The levels of none
of the organic acids were measured, and less than 0.7 g/L xylitol
was detected in the fed-batch culture. The xylose conversion rate
in the fed-batch fermentation (0.31 mmol/gDW/h) was increased by 1.4-fold
when compared with the flask culture (0.23 mmol/gDW/h).

In summary,
we have reported the bioconversion of xylose to ethylene
glycol and glycolate using recombinant C. glutamicum via the synthetic Ru1P pathway with a molar yield of 0.31 (ethylene
glycol) and 0.99 (glycolate; without the reductive pathway from glyoxylate).
On the basis of the calculation of the theoretical maximum yield using
different xylose utilization pathways,6 synthetic xylulose 1-phosphate, Ru1P pathways, and Dahms pathway,
a molar yield of 1.0 for ethylene glycol and 1.0 for glycolate (without
the reductive pathway from glyoxylate) and 2.0 for glycolate (with
an additional reductive pathway from glyoxylate) can be achieved.8,29 Although the bioconversion of xylose to glycolate was successfully
achieved at an almost maximum molar yield of 0.99, dynamic control
and fine-tuned control of the valve during the pentose phosphate pathway
and synthetic two-carbon pathways in C. glutamicum may be essential to obtain high titers of ethylene glycol and glycolate.

In addition, exploring a reconstructed metabolic network and flux
balance analysis30 and evolving microbial
cells,31 might help improve the final titer,
rate, and yield of ethylene glycol and glycolate from glucose and
xylose in the lignocellulosic hydrolysates.32 The rapid strain development of C. glutamicum could be achieved using the CRISPR-Cas systems including Coryne-CRISPR
inference33 and CoryneCR12-STOP for systematic
gene repression and gene deletion in C. glutamicum. Subsequently, automated strain development using a robotic platform
could be combined for system metabolic engineering.

Methods
Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions
In this study, E. coli DH5α34 and C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (wild-type) were used (Table 1). The E. coli strain was grown in lysogeny broth (LB) containing
10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, and 5 g/L NaCl at 37 °C
on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm. When appropriate, the medium was supplemented
with 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol, 50 μg/mL kanamycin, or
100 μg/mL spectinomycin. C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 and its derivatives were cultivated in brain heart infusion
salt (BHIS) medium at 30 °C on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm.35 When appropriate, the medium was supplemented
with 7.5 μg/mL chloramphenicol, 25 μg/mL kanamycin, and/or
50 μg/mL spectinomycin.

For flask cultivation, the C. glutamicum strains were precultivated in BHIS
medium overnight and then incubated aerobically in CgXII defined medium
(50 mL medium in a 250 mL baffled Erlenmeyer flask) containing either
xylose as the sole carbon source or a mixture of glucose and xylose
at 30 °C on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm.36,37 For both ethylene glycol and glycolate production, cell cultivation
was performed in the presence of 1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).

Construction of Plasmids and Recombinant Strains
For
the bioconversion of xylose to both ethylene glycol and glycolate, dte encoding d-tagatose 3-epimerase from Pseudomonas cichorii and xylA (xylose
isomerase), fucK (l-fuculokinase), and fucA (l-fuculose phosphate aldolase) from E. coli were synthesized (Genscript) with codon optimization
for C. glutamicum, and the synthetic
genes were cloned into a CoryneBrick vector15 (Table 1). In addition, yqhD encoding aldehyde reductase and aldA encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase from E. coli were codon-optimized and synthesized (Genscript) for ethylene glycol
and glycolate production, respectively.

The resulting plasmids
were introduced into C. glutamicum by
electroporation, and strain validation was performed using colony
PCR and DNA sequencing.35,38 For Corynebacterial CRISPR-based Recombineering using Cas12a to generate the STOP codon (CoryneCR12-STOP), crRNA plasmids carrying
crRNAs were constructed from pJYS2_crtYf.39 Target crRNAs for the recombineering were cloned into the standard
vector using a primer containing a target-specific protospacer region.
A 59 bp single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (lagging strand ssODN)
was designed to insert the STOP codons (TAG and TAA) for the target
gene as a nonsense mutation. Target crRNAs and ssODN were cotransferred
into the competent corynebacterial cells harboring pJYS1Ptac. The
oligo primers used for the cloning and ssODNs for the recombineering
are listed in Tables S1 and S2.

Quantification and Analysis of Metabolites using High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography
Glucose, xylose, and organic acids,
including ethylene glycol and glycolate, in the supernatant were quantified
using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as described
previously33,38 Briefly, the culture supernatant
was passed through a syringe filter (0.45 μm pore size). The
concentrations of glucose and organic acids were detected with HPLC
(Agilent 1260 equipped with a diode array detector and a refractive
index detector and a Hi-Plex H, 7.7 × 300 mm, column; Agilent
Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) under the following conditions:
sample volume, 10 μL; mobile phase, 5 mM H2SO4; flow rate, 0.6 mL/min; and column temperature, 65 °C.

Fed-Batch Culture Conditions
Fed-batch fermentation
was conducted in a 5 L jar fermenter (MARADO-05S-XS; CNS Inc., Daejeon,
South Korea) containing 2 L culture medium. The seed culture was prepared
in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL CgXII medium with 2%
(w/v) glucose and 2% (w/v) xylose at 30 °C on a rotary shaker
at 120 rpm. The seed culture was transferred to a fermenter at an
OD600 of 1. The fermenter contained 2 L CgXII medium with
2% (w/v) glucose and 2% (w/v) xylose. When required, 7.5 μg/mL
chloramphenicol was used in the main cultivation. For induction of
the target gene in the CoryneBrick vectors, 1 mM IPTG was added. The
culture pH was adjusted to 7 by adding either 3 N NaOH or 3 N HCl.
Filtered air was constantly supplied at 2 L/min, and the dissolved
oxygen (DO) level was maintained at more than 30% by automatically
controlling the agitation speed between 400 and 800 rpm. The feeding
solution contained 700 g/L xylose. Pulse feeding solutions were added
at 10 g/L using the DO-stat feeding strategy, where the feeding solution
was added when the DO level was 80%.
