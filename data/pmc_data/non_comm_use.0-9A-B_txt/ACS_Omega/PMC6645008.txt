Composites of graphene
quantum dots (GQDs) and reduced graphene
oxide (rGO) with unique three-dimensional (3D) structure are prepared
and their catalytic activities for reduction of nitroarenes are explored.
We demonstrate that the 3D GQDs/rGO composites are more active in
nitroarene reduction than GQDs and rGO. Some of them are even more
active than the Ag-embedded calcium alginate (Ag/CA) or Au-embedded
calcium alginate (Au/CA) catalysts. Interestingly, their catalytic
property is closely related to the ratio of GQDs to rGO in the 3D
GQDs/rGO composites and GQDs-to-rGO mass ratio of 1/4 exhibits the
highest catalytic activity. Raman spectra of the composites show that
GQDs-to-rGO ratio is related to the number of the surface/edge defects,
indicating that the sites of defect and edges are active sites. In
addition, the catalytic performance of the 3D GQDs/rGO composites
is also contributed by their unique 3D network structures that are
beneficial for the reactant adsorption and product diffusion. Given
also the long cycling duration and the easy recovery from the reaction
system, 3D GQDs/rGO composites are potential applicable metal-free
catalytic system for nitorarene reduction.

Introduction
Aromatic amines have
been extensively used as intermediates or
precursors for the syntheses of dyes, pigments, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals,
cosmetics, fibers, polymers, and photographic chemicals.1−3 Traditionally, aromatic amines have been obtained through the selective
reductions of nitroarenes in the presence of various transition metals
or precious metal catalysts.1,4 For instances, Pd,5 Au,6 Pt,7 Ru,8 Ag,9 Cu,10 Fe,11 Ni,12 and some bimetallics
like AuAg,13 FePd,14 and PdCu15 have been successfully utilized.
However, for most aforementioned noble metals, the high price and
scarcity greatly limited their practical applications.

Recently,
metal-free catalysts, especially the nanostructured carbonaceous
materials, have attracted great attention due to their high catalytic
activities, low cost, environmental friendliness, and easy availability.16−21 For instance, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was used in the hydrogenation
of nitrobenzene at room temperature, and it was proposed that possibly
the zigzag edges of rGO acted as catalytic active sites to facilitate
the activation of a reactant molecule based on previous theoretic
calculations.22 However, there is no quantitative
method to define the number of edges or defect sites on rGO to support
the hypothesis. Kong et al. reported that nitrogen-doped graphene
(NG) could catalyze the reduction of 4-nitrophenol.23 Yang et al. also found that the graphitic NG exhibited
the highest catalytic activity in the nitroarene reduction.24 Moreover, boron-doped onion-like carbon and
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) also showed admirable catalytic activity and
stability in nitroarene reduction.25 Recently,
it was reported that the CNTs modified by H2O2 (oCNT) could catalyze nitroarene reduction, and it was proposed
that the carbonyl groups in oCNT are of importance for their catalytic
activity.26 However, exact catalytic mechanisms
for most carbonaceous materials in nitroarene reduction remain unknown.

Previously, our group and others discovered that the nanoarchitectures
assembled with GQDs and other materials could significantly enhance
the catalytic activity and stability of the metal catalysts owing
to the excellent electron transportation capability and good chemical/physical
stabilities of GQDs.27,28 For example, we have found that
GQDs/Au system could efficiently catalyze the oxidation of aromatic
alcohols because they were intimately absorbed on the catalyst.29 Additionally, as aforementioned, the surface/edge
defects of GO and rGO sheets may determine their catalytic activities;18,22 thus, the hypothesis here is that the GQDs should have even larger
periphery area than GO and rGO sheets. To this end, in this work,
we designed and prepared composites of GQDs and hydrothermally reduced
graphene oxide (GQDs/rGO), and explored their catalytic activity in
nitroarene reduction. As will be shown, the GQDs/rGO composites assume
a unique three-dimensional (3D) structure with rGO sheets as structural
(networks) matrices, and GQDs are anchored on them; under moderate
conditions, the reduction of nitroarene can be preceded with 3D GQDs/rGO
composites as catalysts, and the composites exhibited overall higher
catalytic activity than individual GQDs and rGO.

Results and Discussion
Preparations
and Characterizations of 3D GQDs/rGO Composites
The morphologies
of raw GO and GQDs used in the work were characterized
by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure S1). The average lateral size of GO sheets reached to a few micrometers,
and the average lateral size of GQDs was ∼10 nm. GO and GQDs
assumed the same planar aromatic carbon backbone structure; therefore,
as illustrated in Scheme 1, when GQDs and GO aqueous suspensions were mixed, GQDs would
attach to the basal plane of GO through strong π–π
stacking, and the intensity of such kind of interaction would become
stronger when the GO sheets were reduced (rGO) during the hydrothermal
treatment. It has been well documented that the hydrothermal treatment
of the GO aqueous suspensions with appropriate concentration results
in the formation of three-dimensional rGO (3D rGO).30Figure 1a shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the as-prepared
GQDs/rGO4 composite (GQDs-to-GO ratio is 1:4 in weight),
which displays a unique 3D network structure similar to the bare 3D
rGO (Figure S2). Within the composite,
the sheet motif of rGO was maintained well, and GQDs are anchored
uniformly on the basal planes of 3D rGO, as shown in Figure 1b,c. The high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) illustrated that the interplane lattice
constant of GQDs was around 0.2 nm, as shown in Figure 1d, which is very close to that of the graphite
(0.213 nm), corresponding to the (101) facet.31,32 These results indicated clearly that GQDs/rGO composites with a
unique 3D structure were prepared with a simple hydrothermal treatment
of GQDs and GO.

Scheme 1 Illustration of the
Formation Process of the 3D GQDs/rGO Composites
The reduction of the GO into 3D rGO in the composites
was also
confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. As illustrated
in Figure S3, the GO showed the vibration
and deformation peaks of the −OH group at 3395 and 1410 cm–1, the stretching vibration peak of −C=O
group at 1730 cm–1 and the stretching vibration
peak of −C–O group of epoxy and alkoxy at 1226 and 1052
cm–1, respectively.33 In the IR spectrum of 3D GQDs/rGO, peaks for −OH and −C–O
group of epoxy and alkoxy disappeared, suggesting that GO was reduced.

Catalytic Activities of the 3D GQDs/rGO Composites
The catalytic
performance of the 3D GQDs/rGO composites in the reduction
of nitroarene with NaBH4 as a reducing agent was first
elaborated using 4-nitrophenol as a model compound, and the reduction
process was monitored with UV–vis spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 2a, there are three
UV–vis absorption peaks for 4-nitrophenol in the 200–500
nm range, the intensity of the peak at 400 nm decreased rapidly with
the progress in reduction and disappeared after 10 min of reaction.
Meanwhile, the appearance of a new absorption peak at 300 nm originating
from 4-aminophenol indicated the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol.23,34 In contrast, NaBH4 is not able to reduce 4-nitrophenol
without a catalyst under the same conditions (Figure S4). The reaction was further evaluated using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography
quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) (Figure S5). Only one peak with a retention time
of 2.838 min corresponding to the product 4-aminophenol was detected
(Figure S5b,c). The results imply that
4-nitrophenol can be reduced by NaBH4 with 3D GQDs/rGO
composite as a catalyst at room temperature.

0.048 mg catalyst, 0.5 μmol substrate, and molar ratio of 4-nitrophenol
to NaBH4 is 1:53.

Surface/Edge Defects of the 3D GQDs/rGO Composites Determine
Their Catalytic Activities
It was proposed in early works
that the surface/edge defects of the rGO might be the catalytic active
sites.18,22 To illustrate the assumption, the Raman
spectra of 3D GQDs/rGO composites with different GQDs-to-rGO ratios
were collected and are shown in Figure 3. In principle, the intensity ratios of D and G bands
in Raman spectra (ID/IG) of 3D GQDs/rGO composites reflect the amounts of the
surface/edge defects of the GQDs and rGO sheets. Actually, as shown
in Figure 3, the ID/IG values of GQDs,
3D rGO, 3D GQDs/rGO1, 3D GQDs/rGO2, 3D GQDs/rGO4, and 3D GQDs/rGO6 were 1.039, 1.234, 1.270, 1.317,
1.322, and 1.287, respectively. The increasing ID/IG values from GQDs, to 3D rGO,
and to GQDs/rGO composites confirmed that the incorporation of GQDs
to rGO led to the generation of more surface/edge defects. Among them,
3D GQDs/rGO4 composite has the highest ID/IG value, implying that
it contained more surface/edge defects than the others. That should
be the main reason why the 3D GQDs/rGO4 has an overall
better catalytic performance than bare GQDs, 3D rGO, and other as-studied
composites.

Figure 3 Raman spectra of GQDs (a), 3D rGO (b), 3D GQDs/rGO1 (c),
3D GQDs/rGO2 (d), 3D GQDs/rGO4 (e), and 3D GQDs/rGO6 (f).

The kinetics of the reductions
of nitroarenes using 3D GQDs/rGO
composites with different GQDs-to-rGO ratios as catalysts was monitored
by measuring the UV–vis absorption intensity variation at 400
nm (Figure 2b). Figure S6 shows the linear correlations of c–c0 (c and c0 represent the concentrations of 4-nitrophenol at reaction
times of t and 0, respectively) versus time for the
different catalysts.4,35,36 Accordingly, the rate constant (k) were obtained
from the slope of the curves of c–c0 versus t and are listed in Table 1. The reaction rate constants with 3D GQDs/rGO
composites as catalysts generally increased with decrease in the GQDs-to-rGO
ratio, but reached the maximum when the GQDs-to-rGO ratio is 1:4,
revealing that the 3D GQDs/rGO4 has the highest catalytic
activity in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol. This is consistent with
the Raman spectroscopic results (3D GQDs/rGO4 assume largest ID/IG values; Figure 3). It is also worth
pointing out that all of the composites assumed generally higher catalytic
activity than individual 3D rGO or GQDs. The catalyst turnover frequency
(TOF), the number of nitroarene molecules that were reduced using
1 g of catalyst per second, was also calculated (Table 1). TOF of the 3D GQDs/rGO is
generally much higher than that of Ag/CA and Au/CA.36 It was reported that Au nanoparticles decorated on thiol-functionalized
reduced graphene oxide (Au/SRG) was a very efficient catalyst for
nitroarene reduction.37 However, no data
of the SRG alone were reported; it is not easy to conclude the role
of SRG in the Au/SRG composite by comparing the polygonal Au nanoparticles
that are in a total different state with the Au modified by SRG. Given
that other conditions are the same, the only difference between the
composites are the number of GQDs on the basal plane of rGO; we thus
conclude that the surface/edge defects within 3D GQDs/rGO act as the
active sites. Actually, similar results was observed with native and
H2O2-treated carbon nanotubes CNTs as catalysts,
the latter being more active.26 It was
also reported recently that GQDs and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) composites
exhibited ultrahigh electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction
and were proposed through numerous surface/edge defects in GQD/GNR
to act as active sites.99

The high catalytic activity of 3D
GQDs/rGO might also be contributed
by their unique 3D morphologies. The catalytic activity of chemically
reduced GO33 was much lower than that of
3D rGO we used in this work (Figure S7a,b). The adsorption of reactants on the surface of GO has been identified
as one of critical steps for their catalysis.23,24 It is possible that the 3D network structural feature is helpful
for the substrate adsorption as well as product diffusion. However,
the specific surface area of 3D GQDs/rGO (∼178 m2 g–1) determined by nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherm curves is lower than that of rGO (∼220 m2 g–1), and the surface area of 3D GQDs/rGO is quite
similar to that of 3D rGO (Figure S8).
The difference between the surface areas of rGO and 3D rGO is not
unexpected because of their different preparation methods, as described
in Experimental Section. In addition, the
result further confirms that the catalytic activity of 3D GQDs/rGO
is primarily determined by the surface/edge defects within the composites.
Taken together, the surface/edge defects combined with the unique
3D structure of 3D GQDs/rGO composites made them active catalysts
for nitroarene reduction.

Catalytic Activity of 3D GQDs/rGO in the
Reduction of Nitroarene
Derivatives
The catalytic activity of the 3D GQDs/rGO composites
was also tested for the reductions of 4-nitrotoluene, 4-nitroanisole,
4-nitrochlorobenzene, 2-nitroanline, and 1,3-dinitrobenzene under
the same reaction conditions, and the results are shown in Figure S9, S10, and Table 2. Generally, all of the derivatives of nitroarene
examined could be reduced with 3D GQDs/rGO as a catalyst. As shown
in Table 2, the reduction
of the nitroarenes containing electron-withdrawing groups was much
slower than that of those containing electron-donating groups. It
means that electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring do favor
for the reduction of nitroarenes. For instance, the reduction yield
of 4-nitrophenol is 92.93% (entry 1), whereas the reduction of 4-nitrochlorobenzene
was only about 51.67% (entry 4). The lower reduction yield was due
to the formation of byproducts, as confirmed by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS (Figure S11). The fast rates and high yields indicated
that the 3D GQDs/rGO was an efficient catalyst for the reduction of
nitroarenes containing the electron-donating groups, such as −OH,
−CH3, and −OCH3. Through detecting
the reduction intermediates of different substrates (Figure S12), we found that nitrosobenzene and hydroxylamine
were detected in the reduction of 4-aminophenol after 3 min of reaction
(in the middle of the reaction; Figure 2a), whereas hydroxylamine, azobenzene, and hydrazobenzene
were found in the reduction of 4-nitrotoluene. These different intermediates
implied that the reduction pathway for nitroarenes with 3D GQDs/rGO
as a catalyst might be closely related to the substrates. When substrate
nitroarenes contain stronger electron-donating groups (like −OH)
on its aromatic ring, reduction seems a direct pathway; if weaker
electron-donating groups (like −CH3) is on the aromatic
ring, the condensation pathway is more likely.38,39

3D GQDs/rGO4, 0.5 μmol substrate, molar ratio of

and yields of amine were determined by HPLC using external standard
method.

For practical application,
the stability of the 3D GQDs/rGO composites
during catalytic reaction was tested. The composites were separated
from the reaction system through centrifugation and washed three times
with methanol and reused. As shown in Figure S13, no obvious deactivation was detected after 10 successive runs.
In addition, the SEM image of the sample after the catalytic cycles
shows that the composite retain the three-dimensional network (Figure S14), suggesting that 3D GQDs/rGO composites
have a good reusability and stability that should be practically applicable
in the reduction of nitroarenes.

Conclusions
Three-dimensional
GQDs/rGO composites with different ratios of
GQDs versus GO were prepared via one-pot hydrothermal method. The
3D GQDs/rGO composites showed improved catalytic activities for the
reduction of nitroarene compared with GQDs, 3D rGO, and some metal
catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the 3D GQDs/rGO is directly
related to the GQDs-to-rGO ratio, which reflects the content of surface/edge
defects within the composites. The catalytic activities of the 3D
GQDs/rGO composites are also contributed by their unique structures.
The unique 3D structure seems helpful for the absorption of reactants
on the surface of 3D GQDs/rGO composites and prompts the product diffusion
in the catalyst. It was also found that the 3D GQDs/rGO composites
have higher catalytic activities for the nitroarenes with electron-donating
groups on their aromatic rings. This, coupled with their high stability
and ease of separation and recyclability, indicated that 3D GQDs/rGO
could find practical applications in the reductions of nitroarenes.

Experimental
Section
Materials
4-Nitrophenol, 4-nitrotoluene, 4-nitroanisole,
4-nitrochlorobenzene, 2-nitroanline, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, and sodium
borohydride (NaBH4) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. All of the chemicals were used
as received. GO and GQDs were prepared following the procedures described
in our previous works.33,40

Preparation of 3D GQDs/rGO
Composites
In a typical
experiment, 12 mL, 2 mg/mL aqueous dispersion of GO was added to an
30 mL autoclave, GQDs were then added to get final GQDs/GO ratios
of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6 (in weight) and stirred for 10 min. The
autoclaves were transferred to an oven and kept at 180 °C for
9 h. During the thermal treatment, GO was reduced and abbreviated
as 3D rGO. After cooling down to room temperature, the solid products
were separated through centrifuging and washing three times with deionized
water. Finally, the composites were dried for 24 h in a vacuum freezing-dryer.
The corresponding composites are named as 3D GQDs/rGO1,
GQDs/rGO2, GQDs/rGO4, and GQDs/rGO6 corresponding to their initial GQDs-to-GO ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4,
and 1:6 (in weight). For comparison, 3D rGO was prepared by hydrothermal
reaction of the GO without GQDs under similar condition.

Catalytic Reduction
of Nitroarene
Nitroarene (0.5 mL,
1 mM), NaBH4 (2 mL, 5 mg/10 mL), and 3D GQDs/rGO (48 μL,
1 mg/mL) were mixed in a UV–vis cuvette. The reduction reaction
was followed by monitoring UV–vis absorption of the reaction
mixture at λmax at room temperature. The reduction
reactions of nitroarene were also conducted with bare rGO and GQDs
as catalysts under the same condition as controls.

Instrumental
Atomic force microscopic (AFM) images
of GQDs and GO were taken on a MultiMode Nanoscope V scanning probe
microscopy system (Veeco), and AN-NSC 10AFM cantilever tips (SHNIT
Co., Russia) with a force constant of ∼37 N/m and resonance
vibration frequency of ∼330 kHz were used. Samples for AFM
were prepared by dropping the aqueous suspension (∼0.02 mg/mL)
of GO or GQDs on a freshly cleaved mica surface and dried in air.
The SEM images were acquired using Ultra 55 field emission scanning
electron microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with the working voltage of 10.0
kV. the TEM images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission
electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) with the operation voltage of 200
kV. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were recorded on the same
instrument. The TEM specimens were prepared by placing the ethanol
suspensions on the copper grids and drying under ambient condition.
The FT-IR spectra were acquired on a EQUINOX 55 FT-IR spectrometer
(Bruker, Germany). The specimens for FT-IR measurement were prepared
by grinding the dried powder of GO, rGO, or GQDs/rGO with KBr together
and then compressing it into thin pellets. Raman measurements were
performed on a Senterra R200-L Dispersive Raman Microscope (Bruker,
Germany) with the excitation laser beam wavelength of 633 nm. The
powders of GQDs, rGO, and GQDs/rGO after grinding were used for the
Raman measurement. The surface area was determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method by ASAP 2020 M (Micromeritics). Catalytic reactions were
monitored using a UV-2550 UV–vis spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan).
After the reaction, the conversion of nitroarene and yield of corresponding
aniline were analyzed by 1220 HPLC (Agilent Technologies) with phosphate
buffer (A) and acetonitrile (B) as mobile phase. The reaction mixture
and reaction intermediates were analyzed by ACQUITY UPLC & Q-TOF
MS Premier (Waters) with water (A) and acetonitrile (B) as mobile
phase under gradient elution conditions.
