Metallurgical
silicon was studied for photocatalytic H2 evolution activity.
It has been found that metallurgical silicon
with large particle size (above 800 nm) possesses poor photocatalytic
activity because of the deteriorating photoelectric performance of
the low-purity silicon. After size reduction (around 400 nm) and metal
nanoparticle decoration, the photocatalytic performance was significantly
enhanced to 1003.3 μmol·g–1·h–1. However, the photocatalytic performance of the Cu-,
Ag-, and Pt-decorated silicon is degraded with the increase of time.
Moreover, the degradation is independent of the metal. Electrochemical
test and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that the Mott–Schottky
effect in the metal–silicon contact should be responsible for
the degradation. After forming a heterojunction by vulcanizing the
Ag-decorated silicon, the degradation was suppressed. Upgradation
of the metal–silicon contact to form a heterojunction was a
promising way to suppress the degradation and retain the high photocatalytic
performance.

1 Introduction
Silicon
is the one of the most abundant elements on earth and the
fundamental material for modern society. Because of the outstanding
semiconducting properties, silicon has been studied as the core material
of microelectronics and solar cells for decades.1−4 Recently, silicon has attracted
considerable interest because of its potential applications in photocatalytic
water treatment and water splitting.5−8 Hydrogen fluoride (HF)-treated silicon nanowires
(SiNWs) prepared by a metal-assisted chemical etching method showed
excellent photocatalytic activity, which are better than the novel
metal nanoparticle-decorated one.9−11 The NW-formed heterostructure
with metal nanoparticles also exhibit high photocatalytic activity.12−14 Qu et al. presented that the Pt nanowire/SiNW heterostructure formed
metal–semiconductor Schottky photodiodes, exhibiting a stable
hydrogen production rate at 2.64 × 10–4 μmol·s–1, and the average external quantum yield throughout
the visible range for the Pt/Si/Ag photodiodes was 0.14%.15 Metal oxide/Si heterostructures were proved
as high-performance photocatalysts.16,17 SiNWs@Co3O4-0.3 M arrays are reported to reach a H2 evolution rate of 21.7 μmol·h–1, which
is more than 2 times of bare SiNW arrays.18 Wang et al. fabricated three-dimensional silicon/hematite core/shell
nanowire arrays decorated with gold nanoparticles, and the efficiency
of the solar water splitting device reached 6.0% under AM 1.5G illumination
without an external bias.19

Although
silicon has been proved to be an excellent photocatalyst,
those catalysts are all based on silicon wafer made by the high-purity
silicon. Except the high-purity silicon (>99.9999%) used in the
microelectronics
and solar cells, the main product of silicon is metallurgical silicon,
which is produced millions of tons each year.20 Metallurgical silicon has the advantages of low cost, low energy
consumption, and mass production.21 Solar
hydrogen photoproduction by water splitting is supposed to be another
low-cost and large-scale application because of the low-energy density
nature of solar energy and the requirement of the treatment of a large
amount of industrial wastewater.22 In that
aspect, metallurgical silicon should be the better material. However,
the impurity content in metallurgical silicon is more than 1%, which
introduces defects and recombination centers up to 1021 cm–3 and significantly deteriorates the electrical
properties of silicon including conductivity, carrier mobility, minor
carrier lifetime, and so on.20,23 Because of the limited
electrical properties of metallurgical silicon, which is known as
an electronically dead material,24 purification
and refinement are needed for further utilization.25 The complex purification step required high energy consumption,
which is neither economically feasible nor environment-friendly. On
the other hand, size reduction is a promising way to trigger the electronic
activity of metallurgical silicon for the efficient carrier extraction
and reduced requirements for material quality,24,26 and nanosized metallurgical silicon has already been applied in
lithium-ion batteries with the advantages of low cost and low energy
consumption.27,28 Unfortunately, a systemic study
on the photocatalytic performance of metallurgical silicon is still
lacking.

In this work, we employed metallurgical silicon for
photocatalytic
water splitting and demonstrated a high photocatalytic performance
by particle size reduction. Systematic characterizations suggested
that the decay of photocatalytic activity originated from the Mott–Schottky
effect in the metal–silicon contact. A simple upgradation of
the metal–semiconductor junction to form a heterojunction was
a promising way to maintain the stability of the photocatalyst.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Particle Size and Diffusion
Length
To acquire the electrical properties of silicon, bulk
silicon was
cut into thin silicon wafers (Figure S1) and measured by a hall measure system. The inhomogeneity of metallurgical
silicon seriously affects the consistence of measurement. Nevertheless,
all measurements indicated a p-type conductivity, and the average
carrier concentration np was 9.14 ×
1016 cm–3 and the hole mobility of silicon
μp is 40.68 cm2/(V·S) (Table S1). The major impurities in metallurgical
silicon are Fe, Al, Ca, B, and P. Among those impurities, Fe, Ca,
and other transitional-metal elements whose impurity energy level
located near the middle of the band gap produced deep energy level
had little influence on majority carrier concentrations but to the
lifetime of minor carrier. Aluminum and boron as well as phosphorus
are the shallow-level dopants, which made the most contribution to
the majority carrier concentrations. According to the inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy analysis, the purity
of metallurgical silicon is about 99.4%, and the contents of impurity
elements are 3658, 2175, 298, 25, and 11 ppm for Fe, Al, Ca, P, and
B, respectively. Considering the high concentration of the impurities
in metallurgical silicon, it can be regarded as a heavily P-doped
polysilicon, and the minor carrier mobility μn in
the highly doped region was restricted around 101 to 102 cm/V s.22,23,29,30 The minor carrier lifetime τn derived from transient photoluminescence spectra as 1.09 ns was
measured as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Transient photoluminescence spectra of metallurgical silicon wafer.

The diffusion length of minor carrier can be calculated
by  where μn is the electron
mobility of silicon, k0 is the Boltzmann
constant, T is the temperature measured, q is the electric charge of electron, and τn is the electron lifetime. The calculated electron diffusion length
was around 165–522 nm.

To reveal the influence of the
minor carrier diffusion length on
the photocatalytic performance, the silicon powders with different
sizes were tested. As shown in Figure 2, the photocatalytic performance was enhanced with
the decrease of particle size. It is inferred that the photogenerated
carrier can be extracted and utilized when the silicon particle sizes
were reduced and approximated to the minor carrier diffusion length.

Figure 2 H2 evolution rate of silicon with various particle sizes
under visible light (a) and 365 nm LED (b).

However, further reducing the particle size led to a decrease of
photocatalytic activity. Because silicon is an indirect band gap semiconductor,
not only photon but also phonon was involved in the processes of absorbing
an incident photon with an energy near the band gap.31,32 In contrast to the direct band gap semiconductor which can absorb
photon in the form of nanoparticles, the low absorption coefficiency
of silicon could be another limitation of the photocatalytic activity.
According to the Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law, the transmittance
of silicon T is  where α is
the absorption coefficient
and L is the length of the incident light through
the silicon sample. For the photon at 420 nm, 99% of incident photon
can be absorbed by sample D8.33 The values
were cut down to 85 for sample D4. Moreover, only 32 % of the incident
photon at 500 nm, which is the largest flux of the sunlight, can be
absorbed by sample D4. As shown in Figure 2, the ranking of the photocatalytic activity
of the three samples was D8 > D4 > D18. It is supposed that
the nature
of indirect band gap would result in the low utilization of visible
light. To address the issue, 365 nm light-emitting diode (LED) was
used to avoid the interference of the absorption length as all three
samples can absorb the incident photon completely. Interestingly,
the ranking changed and D4 had the best photocatalytic performance. Figure 3 shows the comparison
of the transient photocurrent density of the silicon powders with
different particle sizes. The maximum photocurrent density is achieved
in D8 under visual light, while D4 showed the best photoelectric response
under 365 nm LED. The higher transient photocurrent responses indicate
a stronger ability to generate and transfer photoinduced charge carriers.
The same trend in the photocatalytic activity and photoelectric response
performance clearly demonstrated the competition between the minor
carrier diffusion length and the absorption length (Figure 4a).

diffusion length and the absorption length during photocatalytic H2 evolution. (b) Schematic diagram of H2 evolution

nanoparticles decorated on it.

2.2 Coverage of Metal
The photocatalytic
performance was enhanced after reducing the particle size of silicon.
However, the relative low H2 evolution rate indicated that
the high density of surface states acts as the recombination site
of photogenerated carriers. The decoration of noble metal nanoparticles
on the photocatalyst as a cocatalyst is a conventional method to overcome
the surface states and enhance the photocatalytic performance.12Table 1 lists the H2 evolution rate of the as-prepared
silicon after decorating a corresponding amount of Pt nanoparticles
under visible light. After decorating the Pt nanoparticles, the H2 evolution rate multiplied in several orders of magnitude.
The H2 evolution rate reaches as high as 1003.3 μmol·g–1·h–1 for D4-PtC, which is better
than that for traditional photocatalysts such as TiO2.34,35 However, the photocatalytic performance decreased after decorating
excessive Pt nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images of silicon after decorating excessive Pt nanoparticles are
shown in Figure 5.
It is clear that excessive Pt nanoparticles were the nanoparticles
decorated on the surface of silicon, which formed a core–shell
structure. Figure 6 clearly shows the increase of the reflectance with the increase
of the loading amount of Pt on silicon. Such a core–shell structure
not only obstructs the incident light, thus reducing the photoabsorption
of silicon, but also blocks the hole migration pathway to particle
surface (Figure 4b).

2.3 Metal–Semiconductor Junction and Heterojunction
To clarify the mechanism of photocatalytic performance improvement,
Ag and Cu nanoparticle-decorated silicon samples were tested. All
samples showed a robust increase in the H2 evolution rate.
Because silicon was heavily doped, the position of Fermi level should
be near the valence band. The Fermi level of silicon wafer was measured
by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to be 4.924 eV (Figure S3), and the formation of the Schottky
contact between silicon and metal was expected because Cu and Ag possessed
the lower working function (Figure 7a). The formation of the Schottky contact was favorable
to inject electrons from silicon to metal and results in suppression
of the recombination of the photogenerated carriers.36 The so-called Mott–Schottky effect led to the enhancement
of photocatalytic activity.36,37 On the contrary, the
Ohmic contact should be formed between silicon and Pt because of the
large working function of Pt (5.5 eV). As shown in Figure 7b, the formation of the Ohmic
contact blocks the transferring of electron from silicon to metal
and results in the recombination of the photogenerated carriers. However,
the photocatalytic performance of Pt nanoparticle-decorated samples
was better than that of the low working function of metal. It indicated
that the Schottky contact was formed regardless of working function
of metal. The Fermi-level pinning should be responsible for the Schottky
contact38,39 (Figure 7c).

Figure 7 Schematic diagram of the metal–semiconductor contact
model
for Schottky contact (a), Ohmic contact (b), and Schottky contact
with Fermi-level pinning (c).

Direct evidence of Fermi-level pinning was given by the Mott–Schottky
test.40−42 The Mott–Schottky plot of silicon wafer displays
negative slopes, indicating the p-type semiconductor behavior which
was consistent with the hall measurement results (Figure 8).41 Surprisingly, the Mott–Schottky plot of the powders sample
shows positive slopes, which indicate a n-type behavior (Figure 9). Because the Mott–Schottky
test is sensitive to energy band bending in the surface of silicon,40−42 the surface inversion layer should be originated from the high density
of surface states and resulted in the Fermi-level pinning. We believed
that high-density surface states were the byproduct of the large surface-to-volume
ratio of silicon powder after ball milling. The evidence of surface
states is given by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses
as shown in Figure 10. It is noted that all samples were subjected to Ar ion etching in
order to clean the contamination at the surface of silicon before
test. After cleaning the surface with Ar ion, isolated silicon with
dangling bond as well as SiOx was detected
in the silicon powder sample.43 In contrast,
the bulk silicon spectrum was mainly composed of Si 2p.

plots of silicon wafer.

plots of silicon powders (D4).

Figure 10 XPS
spectrum of silicon powder (a) and silicon wafer (b).

Although the photocatalytic performances were significantly
improved,
the decoration of metal nanoparticles on silicon also caused severe
decay problems, which are exhibited in Figure 11. Photocatalytic activity decay has been
reported to be due to the Si–OH formation on the surface of
silicon during photocatalytic reaction. To confirm the oxidation mechanism,
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Pt nanoparticle-decorated silicon
before and after photocatalytic reaction was examined. As shown in Figure 12, the pattern of
the sample after photocatalytic reaction was basically consistent
with that before photocatalytic reaction. However, there was an extra
broad peak around 22°, which was attributed to the oxide of silicon.
Thus, the oxidation of the silicon surface greatly impacted the efficiency
of hydrogen production.11 According to
the photocatalytic performances of metal-loaded silicon, the degradation
can be described as a function of time, which is given by  where y is the photocatalytic
H2 evolution rate, a is the performance
coefficient which depended on the metal nanoparticles, x is the photocatalytic reaction time, and b is the
degradation coefficient which is determined by the Schottky barrier
height. The degradation coefficient (Table S2), which is independent of the working function of metal, indicated
the Schottky barrier height which, pinned by surface states, almost
remained constant.44 The so-called Mott–Schottky
catalysts brought the benefit of the enhancement of the photocatalytic
activity as well as the problem of surface oxidation. Because surface
oxidation was inevitable in the metal nanoparticle-decorated silicon,
the pn heterojunction should be formed instead of the metal–semiconductor
junction to prevent the formation of Schottky contact. To address
the issue, we simply upgraded the photocatalyst from the metal nanoparticle-decorated
silicon by vulcanization.45 As shown in Figure 13, a heterojunction
was formed between Ag2S and silicon. The injection of photogenerated
carriers into silicon would significantly improve the durability of
the photocatalyst.46 During four cycle
experiments, the heterojunction sample almost remains constant photocatalytic
H2 evolution (Figure 14).

3 Conclusions
Metallurgical
silicon-based photocatalysts with different particle
sizes were prepared, and the photocatalytic performances were studied.
The low-purity silicon demonstrated unexpected high photocatalytic
performance. The photocatalytic performance was triggered by the particle
size reduction, which is approximated to minor carrier diffusion length.
The H2 evolution rate was increased by hundred-folds but
faced the severe degradation at the same time. The Mott–Schottky
effect in the metal–silicon contact should be responsible for
the degradation. Upgradation of the metal–silicon contact to
form a heterojunction was a promising way to suppress the degradation
and retain the high photocatalytic performance.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Preparation of Silicon Photocatalysts
Bulk metallurgical silicon was purchased and crushed into powder
and then subjected to high-energy ball milling for reducing the particle
size of silicon (Figure S1). The D50 values
(the average particle size) of the samples were 0.387, 0.851, and
1.858 μm and were labeled D4, D8, and D15, respectively (Figure S2). The decoration of metal nanoparticles
was performed by the electroless deposition technique.10 Briefly, 1 g of silicon powders was first rinsed
with 100 mL of 0.4 M HF solution to remove contamination and oxide
on the surface. After vacuum-drying, the samples were subjected to
a 0.2 M HF solution containing a corresponding amount of H2PtCl6 to decorate the Pt nanoparticles on the silicon.
The molar ratios of Pt to Si in the solution were 0.025, 0.04375,0.0625,
0.9375, and 0.125%, and the corresponding samples were labeled PtA,
PtB, PtC, PtD, and PtE, respectively. The Cu or Ag nanoparticles on
silicon were decorated by replacing H2PtCl6 with
Cu(NO3)2 or AgNO3. The transformation
of Ag nanoparticles decorated on silicon to Ag2S is vulcanizing,
as described in the literature.41 Briefly,
0.2 g of Ag-decorated silicon powder was immersed in a N,N-dimethylformamide solution containing 20 mg of
sulfur for 8 h at 25 °C. The obtained precipitates were centrifuged
and rinsed with ethanol for several times.

4.2 Characterizations
The crystallinity
of the films was characterized using Rigaku Ultima IV XRD. TEM and
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images were taken using
a TECNAI F20 at 200 kV. The transmittance spectra were obtained via
the Shimadzu UV-2500 UV/vis spectrometer with a wavelength ranging
from 190 to 1100 nm. XPS measurements were performed in a Thermo Fisher
K-Alpha+ system with a Al Kα source. Photoluminescence measurement
was carried out on the FLS-980 UV/V/NIR fluorescence spectrometer.
Transient photocurrent response spectrum and Mott–Schottky
analyses were conducted on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation.
The photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were performed
in a gastight glass reactor with a top quartz window. A xenon arc
lamp (Perfect Light PLS-SXE300) equipped with a UV cutoff filter (λ
≥ 420 nm) was used as a light source and positioned 20 cm away
from the reactor. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 50 mg of
the catalyst was dispersed by constant stirring at 500 rpm in 100
mL of methanol solution (10%). Hydrogen was analyzed on-line by gas
chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu), which was equipped with a carbon
molecular sieve-packed column and used argon (99.999%) as the carrier
gas.
