Analytical expressions for the exchange
free energy per particle
of the uniform electron gas (UEG) associated with the short-range
(SR) interelectronic interaction at the low- and high-temperature
limits are examined, yielding an accurate analytical parametrization
for the SR exchange free energy per particle of the UEG as a function
of the uniform electron density, temperature, and range-separation
parameter. This parametrization constitutes the local density approximation
for the SR exchange free energy functional, which can be the first
step toward finding generally accurate range-separated hybrid functionals
in both finite-temperature density functional theory and thermally
assisted-occupation density functional theory.

Introduction
Over the past decades, Kohn–Sham
density functional theory
(KS-DFT)1,2 has been one of the most powerful quantum-mechanical
methods for studying the ground-state properties of atoms, molecules,
and bulk materials.3,4 However, since the exact exchange–correlation
(XC) energy functional Exc[ρ] in
KS-DFT remains unknown, numerous efforts have been devoted to improving
the accuracy of approximate XC energy functionals.

The uniform
electron gas (UEG) is an important system from which
the local density approximation (LDA) for the XC energy functional, ExcLDA, can be developed. However, a major shortcoming associated with
the LDA is the self-interaction error (SIE),5 which can be efficiently reduced by incorporating the Hartree–Fock
(HF) exchange energy ExHF into the LDA XC energy functional ExcLDA. A global hybrid (GH) XC energy functional6,7 may
generally achieve this. However, to reduce the SIE problem more effectively,
the range-separated hybrid (RSH) scheme can be adopted.8−19 Particularly, in the long-range corrected hybrid (LCH) scheme, the
Coulomb operator is partitioned into the long-range (LR) and short-range
(SR) operators, commonly achieved with the use of the standard error
function (erf) and the complementary error function (erfc) 1  On the right-hand
side of eq 1, the first
term is the LR operator
(i.e., the erf operator), the second term is the SR operator (i.e.,
the erfc operator), and ω is the range-separation parameter
controlling the range of the SR operator (atomic units are used throughout
the paper). The LCH XC energy functional can be commonly expressed
as ExcLCH = ExLR-HF + ExSR-LDA + EcLDA, where ExLR-HF is the HF exchange energy associated
with the LR operator, ExSR-LDA is the LDA exchange energy
functional associated with the SR operator, and EcLDA is the
LDA correlation energy functional (i.e., associated with the Coulomb
operator). Accordingly, the SIE associated with an LCH XC energy functional
can be greatly reduced, and the corresponding XC potential possesses
the correct −1/r asymptote in the asymptotic
regions of atomic and molecular systems. At ω = 0 (i.e., the
SR interelectronic interaction reduces to the Coulomb interelectronic
interaction), ExcLCH reduces to ExcLDA. Note also
that in the LCH scheme, ExSR-LDA and EcLDA, which are the
functionals based on the LDA (i.e., the simplest density functional
approximation), may be replaced with those based on more sophisticated
density functional approximations [e.g., the generalized-gradient
approximations (GGAs)] for improved accuracy.

Finite-temperature
density functional theory (FT-DFT) was first
proposed by Mermin,20 wherein the grand
canonical ensemble is adopted to study the thermodynamic properties
of a physical system at temperature T. To obtain
the thermal equilibrium density in FT-DFT, one needs to solve the
following self-consistent equations 2  where 3  is the effective
potential, vext(r) is the
external potential, and μxc(r) = δFxc[ρ]/δρ(r) is
the XC potential (i.e.,
the functional derivative of the XC free energy functional Fxc[ρ]). The thermal equilibrium density
is given by 4  where μ is the chemical potential chosen
to conserve the number of electrons and kB is the Boltzmann constant. At T = 0, FT-DFT reduces
to KS-DFT and the XC free energy functional Fxc[ρ] reduces to the XC energy functional Exc[ρ].

Although FT-DFT has been proposed for
several decades, only KS-DFT
has received massive applications in solid-state physics and quantum
chemistry. The main reason may be that the “thermal effect”
is commonly regarded as an effect only on nuclei. According to the
Born–Oppenheimer approximation, the Hamiltonian of electrons
can be separated from that of nuclei. The coupling between the vibrational
modes of nuclei and the motion of electrons can be properly described
by some model Hamiltonian and treated as perturbation.21 In many other cases, electrons are not in the
extreme conditions and hence the thermal effect can simply be neglected.
Therefore, the properties of atoms, molecules, and bulk materials
are usually studied using KS-DFT (i.e., FT-DFT with T = 0). Although several efforts have been devoted to understanding
the properties of thermal density functionals,22−26 the applications of FT-DFT are only limited to hot
plasmas and warm dense matter.27−29 Besides, in conventional FT-DFT
calculations, for simplicity, the XC free energy functional Fxc[ρ] has been commonly approximated by
the “zero-temperature” XC energy functional Exc[ρ] evaluated with the thermal equilibrium
density ρ(r) at temperature T.

In 1984, an analytical parametrization for the LDA XC free energy
functional FxcLDA[ρ] was proposed by Perrot and Dharma-wardana,30 based on the low-temperature limit for the exchange
free energy derived by Horovitz and Thieberger.31 In 2000, a classical mapping method32 was adopted to study finite-temperature electron liquid.33 Later, the classical representation of quantum
systems at equilibrium was applied to study two special quantum systems.34−37 Recently, the restricted path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach
was adopted to numerically evaluate the XC free energy per particle
of the warm dense UEG.38 The numerical
data were soon adopted by Karasiev and co-workers for the development
of an accurate parametrization for FxcLDA[ρ].39 Very recently, the most advanced density matrix
quantum Monte Carlo method was adopted to resolve the discrepancy
between the configuration and restricted PIMC results.40 Since these simulations are only limited to
small systems, the finite-size errors were further corrected from
the ab initio finite-N quantum Monte Carlo calculations
and compared with the previous results where the significant difference
was found.41 In addition, a careful study
on the free energy functional for a noninteracting electron system
at temperature T was recently performed by Dufty
and Trickey.42

Nevertheless, owing
to the local approximation, the LDA XC free
energy functional FxcLDA[ρ] should still suffer from the SIE
problem. To reduce this, the aforementioned LCH scheme can be extended
to FT-DFT, i.e., incorporating the HF exchange free energy FxHF into the LDA XC free energy functional FxcLDA. The resulting
LCH XC free energy functional can be expressed as FxcLCH = FxLR-HF + FxSR-LDA + FcLDA, where FxLR-HF is
the HF exchange free energy associated with the LR operator (e.g.,
the erf operator), FxSR-LDA is the LDA exchange free energy
functional associated with the SR operator (e.g., the erfc operator),
and FcLDA is the LDA correlation free energy functional (i.e., associated
with the Coulomb operator). At ω = 0 (i.e., the SR interelectronic
interaction reduces to the Coulomb interelectronic interaction), FxSR-LDA reduces to the LDA exchange free energy functional FxLDA and hence FxcLCH reduces to FxcLDA. Note that in FT-DFT, FxLR-HF is well-defined and FcLDA is readily available in the literature.
Therefore, the focus of the present work is a reliably accurate parametrization
for FxSR-LDA. For brevity, hereafter, we adopt “the
SR LDA exchange free energy functional” (FxSR-LDA) for “the LDA exchange free energy functional associated
with the SR operator” and adopt “the SR LDA exchange
energy functional” (ExSR-LDA or FxSR-LDA with T = 0) for “the LDA exchange energy
functional associated with the SR operator”.

On the other
hand, in 2012, Chai developed thermally assisted-occupation
density functional theory (TAO-DFT)43 for
the study of the ground-state properties of nanoscale systems with
strong static correlation effects (which are “challenging systems”
for traditional electronic structure methods).44−51 In contrast to KS-DFT, an auxiliary system of N noninteracting electrons at some “fictitious temperature”
is employed in TAO-DFT, wherein strong static correlation is explicitly
approximated by the entropy contribution (e.g., see eq 26 of ref (43)). A self-consistent scheme
for determining the fictitious temperature in TAO-DFT was recently
proposed.52 In 2017, the GH and RSH schemes
in TAO-DFT were also developed for a wide range of applications.53 Relative to local and semilocal density functionals
in TAO-DFT, GH functionals in TAO-DFT were shown to possess reduced
SIEs. However, to employ the RSH scheme in TAO-DFT, the SR (or LR)
exchange free energy functional (at the fictitious temperature) should
be further developed. Therefore, the development of SR LDA exchange
free energy functional can also be the first step toward finding generally
accurate RSH functionals in TAO-DFT, highlighting the value of the
present work.

For the reasons given above, there is a strong
need for developing
the SR LDA exchange free energy functional for the RSH schemes in
both FT-DFT and TAO-DFT. In Results and Discussion, we first examine analytical expressions for the SR exchange free
energy per particle of the UEG at the low- and high-temperature limits.
For the low-temperature limit, the first-order dependence on temperature
is found to be absent, similar to that found for the exchange free
energy per particle of the UEG. Moreover, the zero-temperature limit
agrees exactly with that reported in the literature.54 Based on these limits and our findings, we develop a reliably
accurate analytical parametrization for the SR exchange free energy
of the UEG as a function of the uniform electron density, temperature,
and range-separation parameter, retaining the correct zero-temperature
and high-temperature limits. Besides, the SR exchange potential of
the UEG, obtained directly from the functional derivative of the parametrized
SR exchange free energy of the UEG, is reliably accurate relative
to the corresponding numerical value. For a general system, the SR
LDA exchange free energy functional is developed. In the last section,
we give our conclusions.

Results and Discussion
SR Exchange Free Energy
Per Particle of the UEG
Consider
a spin-unpolarized system containing N electrons
associated with the SR interelectronic interaction (i.e., the erfc
operator given by eq 1 with the range-separation parameter ω) in a volume V at temperature T, with a positive background
charge keeping the system neutral. Here, N and V are taken to infinity in the manner that keeps the electron
density (ρ = N/V) finite.
The SR exchange free energy of the UEG, FxSR, can be expressed
in both momentum space and coordinate space30,31 5  where nk is given by the Fermi–Dirac distribution
function (with
β = 1/(kBT) and k = |k|) 6  and G(x)
(with x ≡ |x|) is defined as 7  On the basis of eq 5, one can replace the chemical potential μ
with the uniform electron density ρ (i.e., the inversion of
the equation below can be performed, as shown in refs (30) and (55)) 8  and numerically evaluate the SR exchange free
energy per particle of the UEG 9  as a function of the Fermi wave
vector kF = (3π2ρ)1/3 and two dimensionless variables (t ≡ kBT/EF and λ ≡ ω/kF). Here, EF = kF2/2 is the Fermi energy. It is convenient
to define the scaled SR exchange free energy per particle of the UEG 10  which is
a function of the dimensionless variables t and λ
only. Here, μx(kF, 0)
= −kF/π
is the exchange potential of the UEG at the Fermi wave vector kF and t = 0.

In the following
discussion, for the given values of ρ and ω, we examine
the SR exchange free energy per particle of the UEG at the low-t and high-t limits. Therefore, the low-t and high-t limits discussed are equivalent
to the low-temperature (low-T) and high-temperature
(high-T) limits, respectively.

Low-Temperature Limit
Similar to the procedures of
Horovitz and Thieberger,31 we first express FxSR [given by eq 5] as
a function of z ≡ eβμ 11  where the lower limit of integration is determined
by direct calculation of eq 5 in the limit z → 0 12  The derivative of FxSR with respect
to z is given by 13  where g(x) is defined as 14  We now proceed to evaluate FxSR [given
by eq 11] at the large-z limit, which corresponds to the low-t limit (e.g., see eq 5 of ref (55)). It can be shown that 15  where h(z) is a function of z only. Therefore, the integration
of eq 13 with respect
to z from 0 to a constant z1 (see ref (31) for the reason that one can choose such a constant) yields at most
a second-order temperature-dependent term, which can be expressed
as δ/β2. Accordingly, one can separate the
integration in eq 11 with respect to z′ into two parts: (i) from
0 to z1 and (ii) from z1 to z. Using the generalized Sommerfeld’s
lemma,56 in the range of z > z1, one obtains the following low-temperature
expansion 16  where the variable is rescaled
to . The integration in eq 11 with respect to z′
from z1 to z can be transformed
into integration with respect to k from  to , which yields the SR exchange free energy
per volume of the UEG at the low-temperature limit 17  here 18  and 19  where the exponential integral Ei(x) is defined as 20  The first two terms of eq 17 are ω-independent and are
the same
as the results of Horovitz and Thieberger.31 The last two terms (i.e., those with I(k) and J(k)) are ω-dependent,
which are the new results brought by the SR interelectronic interaction.
From eq 17, we find
that the first-order temperature-dependent term vanishes, which is
similar to that found from the exchange free energy per volume of
the UEG at the low-temperature limit.31 Note also that in the last term of eq 17, J(k1)/β2, besides an analogue term with the logarithmic
term of T2 ln T in ref (31) we arrive
at an additional term of T2 Ei(−T), which originates from the SR interelectronic interaction.
For an analysis of the divergent term, one may refer to ref (57). The dependence on k (i.e., (2μ)1/2) can be replaced by the
uniform electron density ρ (see eq 12 of ref (31)), as T approaches zero.

In addition, as ω → 0 (i.e.,
the SR interelectronic interaction reduces to the Coulomb interelectronic
interaction), eq 17 correctly
reduces to the exchange free energy per volume of the UEG at the low-temperature
limit 21  which
was previously reported by Horovitz
and Thieberger.31 Note that the first-order
temperature-dependent term in eq 21 vanishes, which later guided the parametrization function
for the LDA exchange free energy functional of Perrot and Dharma-wardana.30

Besides, on the basis of eq 17, as 1/β → 0 (i.e.,
as T or t reduces to zero), the
scaled SR exchange free energy per
particle of the UEG at the zero-temperature limit (first derived by
Gill, Adamson, and Pople54) can be correctly
obtained 22  

High-Temperature Limit
Here, we examine the SR exchange
free energy per particle of the UEG at the high-temperature limit.
The Taylor series expansion of g(x) [see eq 14] with
respect to z ≡ eβμ yields 23  At the small-z limit, which
corresponds to the high-t limit (e.g., see eq 5 of
ref (55)), one can
keep only the first term and obtain 24  Consequently, the resulting FxSR can be
expressed as 25  Using eq 2.3 of ref (30) to replace z with ρ at
the high-temperature limit, the scaled SR exchange
free energy per particle of the UEG at the high-temperature limit58 can be obtained 26  where t = h stands
for the high-temperature limit.

Note that as ω
→ 0 or λ → 0 (i.e., the SR interelectronic interaction
reduces to the Coulomb interelectronic interaction), eq 26 correctly reduces to the scaled
exchange free energy per particle of the UEG at the high-temperature
limit, i.e., 1/(3t).30

Parametrization for the SR Exchange Free Energy Per Particle
of the UEG
In the work of Perrot and Dharma-wardana,30 a fitting function was proposed to parametrize
the numerical data of the exchange free energy per particle of the
UEG. As the first-order temperature-dependent term vanishes at the
low-temperature limit,31 the temperature-dependent
term in the fitting function of Perrot and Dharma-wardana starts from
the t2 term (see eq 3.2 of ref (30)).

In the present
work, to incorporate the correct zero-temperature limit f̃xSR(t = 0, λ) [see eq 22] and high-temperature limit f̃xSR(t = h, λ) [see eq 26], and also our findings that the first-order
temperature-dependent term vanishes (i.e., the temperature-dependent
term starts from the t2 term) at the low-temperature
limit, we propose the following fitting function 27  to parametrize the numerical data of the scaled
SR exchange free energy per particle of the UEG f̃xSR(t, λ) [given by eq 10], where xi(λ) (i = 1, 2, 3, and 4) is defined as 28  and yi(λ) (i = 1 and 2)
is defined as 29  The fitting to the numerical data is performed
in the range of 0 < t < 12 and 0 < λ
< 20. The optimized parameters for xi(λ) and yi(λ) are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

[given by eq 10] at
various λ values.

yellow, cyan, green, and blue correspond to λ = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4,
0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, respectively.

To examine the accuracy of our parametrization, Figure 3 shows the relative
error of
the parametrization of f̃xSR(t, λ)
[given by eq 27], where
the relative error is defined as the absolute value of ((parametrization
[given by eq 27] –
numerical data [given by eq 10])/(numerical data [given by eq 10])). Relative to the numerical data, our
parametrization is reliably accurate. The relative error is vanishingly
small in the low-t and high-t regions.
However, in the intermediate-t region, the relative
error is slightly larger, especially for the larger λ. The maximum
relative error is 0.087 (i.e., the maximum percentage error = 8.7%)
at t = 6 and λ = 20. Therefore, further investigation
on the expression of f̃xSR(t, λ)
at the large-λ limit can be essential for improved parametrization.

the relative error is defined as the absolute value of ((parametrization
[given by eq 27] –
numerical data [given by eq 10])/(numerical data [given by eq 10])).

SR Exchange Potential of the UEG
In the work of Perrot
and Dharma-wardana,30 the exchange potential
of the UEG was parametrized separately, which can, however, be inconsistent
with the functional derivative of their parametrized exchange free
energy functional of the UEG. It is worth mentioning that Karasiev
and co-workers55 recently proposed a more
accurate parametrization (compared to the one from ref (30)) for the UEG exchange
free energy functional with exchange potential calculated as the corresponding
functional derivative.

For consistency, in the present work,
the SR exchange potential of the UEG, μxSR, is obtained directly from the
functional derivative of FxSR 30  Substituting fxSR = fxSR(kF, t, λ)
= μx(kF, 0) f̃xSR(t, λ) = (−kF/π) f̃xSR(t, λ) [given by eq 27] into eq 30, μxSR can be expressed as 31  On the basis
of eq 31, it is convenient
to define the scaled SR
exchange potential of the UEG 32  which is a function of the dimensionless
variables t and λ only. As f̃xSR(t, λ) [given by eq 27] is parametrized, μ̃xSR(t, λ)
[given
by eq 32] can be evaluated
analytically.

Figure 4 shows the
surface plot for μ̃xSR(t, λ) [given by eq 32] and the scattered circles
for the corresponding numerical data [given by differentiating eq 10]. Figure 5 shows the fitting curves for μ̃xSR(t, λ) [given by eq 32] and the scattered circles for the corresponding numerical
data [given by differentiating eq 10].

yellow, cyan, green, and blue correspond to λ = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4,
0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, respectively.

To assess the accuracy of our parametrization, Figure 6 shows the relative error of
the parametrization of μ̃xSR(t, λ) [given by eq 32], where the relative
error is defined as the absolute value of ((parametrization [given
by eq 32] – numerical
data [given by differentiating eq 10])/(numerical data [given by differentiating eq 10])). A good agreement
between our parametrization and the corresponding numerical data can
be clearly seen from the figure. The relative error is vanishingly
small in the low-t and high-t regions.
Nonetheless, in the intermediate-t region, the relative
error is slightly larger, especially for the larger λ. The maximum
relative error is 0.108 (i.e., the maximum percentage error = 10.8%)
at t = 7.7 and λ = 20. As mentioned previously,
the accuracy of the parametrization may be further improved by investigating
the expression of f̃xSR(t, λ) (and hence
the corresponding expression of μ̃xSR(t, λ)
given by eq 32) at the
large-λ limit.

as the absolute value of ((parametrization [given by eq 32] – numerical data [given
by differentiating eq 10])/(numerical data [given by differentiating eq 10])).

LDA for the SR Exchange Free Energy Functional
In the
previous section, the SR exchange free energy per particle of the
UEG fxSR(t, λ) has been discussed and parametrized,
which can now be extended to a general system.

Consider a spin-unpolarized
system containing N electrons associated with the
SR interelectronic interaction (i.e., the erfc operator given by eq 1 with the range-separation
parameter ω) at temperature T, in the presence
of an external potential vext(r). The LDA for the SR exchange free energy per particle can be obtained
by replacing the uniform electron density ρ in eq 27 with the local electron density
ρ(r). Accordingly, kF, EF, t, λ, and
μx(kF, 0) are replaced
with kF(r) = [3π2ρ(r)]1/3, EF(r) = [kF(r)]2/2, t(r) = kBT/EF(r), λ(r) = ω/kF(r), and μx(kF(r), 0) = −kF(r)/π, respectively. Consequently, the
SR LDA exchange free energy functional can be expressed as 33  where Cx = −(3/π)1/3 and f̃xSR(t(r),
λ(r)) [given by eq 27] is the scaled SR exchange free energy per particle
of the UEG at the local electron density ρ(r).
The SR LDA exchange potential is given by the functional derivative
of FxSR-LDA[ρ] 34  Owing to the spin-scaling
relation,59 the extension of the SR LDA
exchange free energy
functional to a spin-polarized system (i.e., with the α-spin
density ρα(r), β-spin density
ρβ(r), temperature T, and range-separation parameter ω) is straightforward 35  where the
spin-polarized functional FxSR-LDA[ρα, ρβ] [see eq 35] can be conveniently
expressed by the spin-unpolarized functional FxSR-LDA[ρ]
[see eq 33].

Conclusions
In summary, we have examined analytical expressions for the SR
exchange free energy per particle of the UEG at the low- and high-temperature
limits. The SR interelectronic interaction brings extra terms in the
two limiting forms when compared with those for the Coulomb interelectronic
interaction. At the low-temperature limit, the temperature-dependent
term starts from the t2 term, which is
similar to that found for the exchange free energy per particle of
the UEG. An analytical fitting function has been proposed for the
SR exchange free energy per particle of the UEG. Accordingly, the
SR LDA exchange free energy functional for a general system has been
developed, with which RSH functionals can be readily devised in both
FT-DFT and TAO-DFT.

In the future, we plan to develop the SR
exchange free energy functionals
based on more sophisticated density functional approximations (e.g.,
GGAs) to further improve the accuracy of RSH functionals in both FT-DFT
and TAO-DFT. Note that an accurate GGA XC free energy functional (i.e.,
associated with the Coulomb operator) has been recently developed.60
