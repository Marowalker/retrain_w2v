This paper investigates the crystallization
process of FeNi alloys
with different impurity concentrations of Ni(x) [x = 10% (Fe90Ni10), 20% (Fe80Ni20), 30% (Fe70Ni30), 40% (Fe60Ni40), and 50% (Fe50Ni50)] at temperature (T) = 300 K and Fe70Ni30 at heating rates of 4 × 1012, 4 ×
1013, and 4 × 1014 K/s at different temperatures, T = 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 900, 1100, and 1300 K. Molecular
dynamics models with the Sutton–Chen embedded interaction potential
and recirculating boundary conditions are used to calculate the molecular
parameters of alloys, such as radial distribution function, total
energy of the system (Etot), size (l), and crystallization temperature (through the relationship
between Etot and T).
The common neighborhood analysis method is used to confirm the theoretical
results of crystallization for Fe–Fe, Fe–Ni, and Ni–Ni.
The annealing process did not have an effect on the crystallization
process of FeNi alloys. The effect of Ni content, heating rate, and
annealing time on structural unit numbers, such as face-centered cubic,
hexagonal close-packed, blocked cubic center, and amorphous, and the
crystallization process of FeNi alloys is also investigated.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, FePt,1 CoPt3,2 CoPt,3 CoRh,4 and NiFe5 alloys are
being used in many application fields such as biology,6,7 adsorption,8,9 data storage,10,11 high-density storage,12−14 photocatalysts,15,16 chemical sensors,17−19 and biomedicine.20−22 FeNi alloys have received
great attention from scientists thanks to their interesting properties:
magnetic,23 photocatalytic,24,25 antioxidant,26,27 and biomedical.28 This material is suitable for biomedical applications because
they exhibit magnetic superparamagnetic properties and thus can be
used for various applications dealing with drug delivery, hyperthermia,
and magnetic resonance imaging.29 Experimental,
theoretical, and simulation methods are used to investigate the structure
of FeNi alloys. With the experimental method, FeNi alloys were successfully
fabricated by the evaporation method at temperature (T) = 1823 K30 with Fe concentrations of
36%, and the size (D) varies from 20 nm to 100 nm;31 the hydrogenation reaction gives spherical nanoparticles
with size smaller than 35 nm;32 and the
plasma treatment in the mixture of H2 and Ar leads to nanoparticles
with nanoscale size.33 The latter depends
on the temperature and air flow rate,34 pyrolysis conditions,35 and preparative
methods.36−38 Fe1–xNix alloys with size 10–25 nm39,40 are being implemented very little by the experimental method, whereas
the simulation method is considered the most interesting method because
of its ability to study at the atomic level without the consumption
of energy as in the experimental methods. They were built by molecular
dynamics (MD) method, Monte-Carlo method, combined with interaction
potentials, such as the average effective field theory,41 atomic method, Finnis and Sinclair,42,43 and embedded interaction Sutton–Chen (SC).44,45 The obtained results are highly accurate. To study the structure
of FeNi materials,46 Daw and Nguyen have
used the MD method with the embedded interaction SC,5,47 in combination with the parameters of Meyer and Entel.48 The experimental method and simulation method
can be combined to obtain high-precision results.49−54 Ni has a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure and Fe has a blocked
cubic center (BCC) structure; however, hybridization leads to new
structures. The change of alloy structure depends on various factors
including solute concentration, atomic number, temperature, annealing
time, and so forth. The solute concentration (x)
of Fe in Ni1–xFex alloy can reach 100% at high temperatures, ranging from T = 1183 K to T = 1665 K,55 whereas at low temperatures, the impurity concentration
can reach a maximum of x = 66%.55,56 In addition, scientists used the electron model57−60 to study the defect buttons,
defects, and surface properties of materials.36,61 To study the structure and phase transition temperature of CuNi
and CuAu, energy alignment method,62 the
ability method of Blaha et al.,63 and the
network constants of the material64 are
used. With the MD simulation method, Grujicic et al. have successfully
studied the effect of impurity concentration65,66 and have established the relationship between the FCC and BCC structural
phases. Lavrentiev et al.67 determined
the effect of concentration of Ni impurities in Fe1–xNix from x = 5% to x = 75% on the phase transition temperature
(Tm) = 800 K; in the FCC structure, the
crystallization temperature, Tg = 600
K. Recently, we have successfully studied the effect of the impurity
concentration of Fe in Ni1–xFex nanoparticles, with x =
10, 30, and 50%, on the radial distribution function (RDF) structural
unit numbers, FCC, hexagonal close-packed (HCP), and amorphous (Amor).5 In addition, with the concentration of Cu solids
of 33% in AlCu, the transition temperature (Tm) is found to be 821 K,76 whereas
an increase in the number of CuNi atoms leads to an increase in the
concentration of solute Ni,77 and Ag increases
in CuAg.78 As previously mentioned that
FeNi is a promising material, however, the molecular structure is
not reported in the literature. Moreover, the effect of inlet conditions
such as heating rate, impurity concentration, and annealing time at
a molecular level is investigated by using the MD method with the
embedded interaction potential SC and recirculation boundary conditions.
Various molecular parameters are calculated for these alloys, which
will be useful for a better understanding of the behavior of these
alloys at a molecular level.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Impurity Concentration
The effect of Ni concentration
in the alloys on the shape and RDF
of samples Fe90Ni10, Fe80Ni20, Fe70Ni30, Fe50Ni50 (FeNi),
and Fe60Ni40 is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a shows that Fe90Ni10 at T = 300 K has a cube shape, created by two types of atoms,
Fe and Ni, in which Fe atoms are in red color and Ni atoms are in
blue color. The first peak position of RDF has a value, r = 2.45 Å, height g(r) of
5.03 (Figure 1b), size
(l) = 7.46 nm, and the total energy of the system
(Etot) = −2188.47 eV. An increase
in the impurity concentrations (x) of Ni in FeNi
alloys from Fe90Ni10 to Fe80Ni20, Fe70Ni30, Fe60Ni40, and FeNi leads to an increase in the r value from
2.45 Å to 2.45, 2.48, 2.60, and 2.60 Å; g(r) decreases from 5.03 to 4.73, 4.46, 4.28, and
4.71; l increases from 7.46 nm to 7.50, 7.54, 7.59,
and 7.63 nm, and Etot decreases from −2188.47
eV to −3437.55, −4703.88, −5929.33, and −7175.27
eV (Table 1).

For Fe70Ni30, r = 2.48 Å,
which is consistent with the experimental result (r = 2.53 Å)21 and simulation results
(r = 2.49 Å).5 Besides,
the effects of particle size (l) and Etot with the solute concentrations of Ni are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Relationship between
the size (l) and the solute
concentration of Ni (a) and that between the total energy of the system
(Etot) and the solute concentration of
Ni (b).

The results show that the size
(l) of FeNi alloys
is always directly proportional to the solute concentration of Ni
and satisfies the formula: l = 7.415 + 0.43x (Figure 2a); the energy of the system (Etot) is
directly proportional with the solute concentration of Ni (−x) and satisfies the formula: Etot = −947.28 – 12 465.38x. Figure 2b shows that the
solute concentration (x) has a significant influence
on l and Etot of FeNi
alloys. The obtained results show that l is directly
proportional with x and Etot is directly proportional with −x. The results
are in line with those recently reported by the simulation method5 and the experiment method.72 To confirm the accuracy of the obtained results, the visualization
method and common neighborhood analysis (CNA) method have been used,
and the results are shown in Figure 3, Table 2.

HCP structure (b), BCC structure (c), and Amor structure (d).

Fe60Ni40	1777	852	32	2663	
Fe50Ni50	1722	1080	25	2497	
Figure 3 shows that
FeNi alloys exhibits four types of structure: FCC structure (Figure 3a), HCP structure
(Figure 3b), BCC structure
(Figure 3c), and Amor
structure (Figure 3d). An increase of Ni solute concentration from Fe90Ni10 to Fe80Ni20, Fe70Ni30, Fe60Ni40, and FeNi leads to an increase
and then a decrease of the FCC, HCP, and BCC structure unit numbers,
whereas the Amor structure unit number first decreases and then increases
(Table 2). This confirms
that the increase of solute concentration of Ni in FeNi alloys leads
to an increase of crystallization rate. This phenomena is not often
observed. The largest crystallization process is observed when the
solute concentration of Ni in FeNi alloy, x = 30%.

This result is consistent with those recently reported for Cu (33%)
in AlCu,76 the concentration of soluble
Ni increases when the number of atoms CuNi77 and Ag increases in CuAg.78 To further
investigate the effect of other factors on the molecular structure,
FeNi alloy has been chosen as the reference, with a Ni-doped concentration
of x = 30% (Fe70Ni30), to study
in the next sections.

2.2 Effect of Heating Rate
Several molecular
parameters of the sample Fe70Ni30 at T = 300 K as a function of heating rate (4 × 1012, 4 × 1013, and 4 × 1014 K/s)
are shown in Table 3.

Table 3 Size, Energy, First Peak Position,
and First Peak Position Height of RDF with Different Heating Rates
 	FeNi alloys	 	
heating rate (K/s)	4 × 1012	4 × 1013	4 × 1014	results (Å)

l (nm)	7.54	7.59	7.56	 	
Etot (eV)	–4703.88	–4688.11	–4685.93	 	
Table 3 shows that
Fe70Ni30 at T = 300 K with
a heating rate of 4 × 1012 K/s has r = 2.48 Å, g(r) = 4.46, l = 7.54 nm, and Etot = −4703.88
eV. An increase in the heating rate from 4 × 1012 to
4 × 1013 and 4 × 1014 K/s leads to
an increase of r from 2.48 Å to 2.60 Å
and a decrease of g(r) from 4.46
to 3.90; l changes in the range from 7.54 to 7.59
nm; and Etot increases from −4703.88
eV to −4685.93 eV. These results show that the increase of
the heating rate leads to the transfer of Fe70Ni30 from the crystalline state to amorphous state. To confirm the accuracy
of the results, the visualization method and the CNA method are used,
and the results are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Structural shape (a1–c1) and the structural unit
numbers
of FeNi alloys (a2–c2) at different heating rates.

The results show that Fe70Ni30 with
a heating
rate of 4 × 1012 K/s has different structural shapes
(Figure 4a1–c1)
corresponding to the structural unit number: 3547 FCC, 1290 HCP, 53
BCC, and 434 Amor, respectively. When the heating rate is increased
from 4 × 1012 to 4 × 1013 and 4 ×
1014 K/s, the structural unit number of FCC decreased from
3547 FCC to 1912 FCC and 1055 FCC; HCP decreased from 1290 HCP to
1386 HCP and 736 HCP; BCC decreased from 53 BCC to 0.0 BCC and 37
BCC; and Amor increased from 434 Amor to 2026 Amor and 3496 Amor (Figure 4a2–c2). This
confirms that the increase of the heating rate leads to a decrease
in the crystallization process.

2.3 Influence
of Temperature
The relationship
between the energy of the system Etot and
temperature T = 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 900, 1100,
and 1300 K is also investigated, and the results are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Relationship between Etot and T.

Figure 5 shows that
Fe70Ni30 at T = 300 K has Etot = −4703.88 eV. When T is increased from 300 K to 400, 500, 600, 700, 900, 1100, and 1300
K, the l value increases from 75.41 nm to 75.47,
75.57, 75.64, 75.75, 75.93, 76.32, and 76.79 nm, and Etot increases from −4703.88 eV to −4699.06,
−4691.34, −4685.80, −4677.88, −689.81,
−4665.10, −4647.32, and −4631.61 eV (Figure 5). The results show
that an increase of T leads to an increase of l and Etot. When T increases from 300 K to 600 K and from 600 K to 1300 K, Etot increases linearly, and an interrupting
point at T = 600 K, corresponding with Etot = −4685.80 eV, is observed. This value is assigned
to the crystallization temperature (Tg) 600 K. This seems to be consistent with the experimental results
(Tg = 593 K).15,23,24 To confirm the accuracy of the obtained
results, CNA and RDF methods are used, and the results are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 RDF (a) and structural
unit numbers (b) of Fe70Ni30 at different temperatures.

Figure 6 indicates
that at T = 300 K, Fe70Ni30 has r = 2.48 Å and g(r) = 4.46. When T is increased from 300
K to 1300 K, r increases from 2.48 Å to 2.63
Å, and g(r) changes in the
range from 4.46 to 4.06 (Figure 6a); however, the structural unit number of FCC remains
unchanged when the temperature varies from 300 K to 600 K. When T > 600 K, FCC declines rapidly; HCP decreases slowly
in
the range from 300 K to 600 K. When T > 600 K,
HCP
decreases rapidly; BCC changes; and Amor lightly increases in the
temperature range from 300 K to 600 K, and then Amor increases rapidly
when T > 600 K (Figure 6b). This asserts that Fe70Ni30 has a thermal transition at T = 600 K.

2.4 Effect of Annealing Time
The results
of Fe70Ni30 after the annealing process are
shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Relationship
between the total energy of the system Etot (a1), structural unit numbers (b1), RDF (c1), and
structural shape (a2–d2) with different annealing times.

The results shows that Fe70Ni30 at an annealing
time (t), t1 = 0.0 ps
has Etot = −4685.80 eV. When annealing t increased from 0.0 ps to 450 ps, Etot remains almost unchanged (Figure 7a1). This confirms that after annealing time,
there is no structural change; a negligible change in the structural
unit numbers is also observed (Figure 7b1); RDF has a negligible change with the annealing
time (Figure 7c1).
Similar tendency has been observed for structural shapes (Figure 7a2–d2). When x = 30%, the crystallization process reaches the maximum
value. When the annealing time is increased, the crystallization process
remains stable. In other words, the crystallization of these alloys
is relatively rapid and is completed after a very short time, and
thus annealing is not necessary to improve the crystallization degree.

3 Conclusions
In this study, the crystallization
process of FeNi alloys by the
MD method is investigated. We have successfully described and calculated
various molecular parameters for these alloys by using the SC interaction
potential and recirculating boundary conditions. We show that the
increase of the solute concentration (x) of Ni in
FeNi alloys leads to an increase of the crystallization process and
that a maximum value is obtained at x = 30%. Our
findings show that the crystallization temperature (Tg) is found to be about 600 K and that the annealing time
(t) does not affect the crystallization state. We
have successfully established the relationship of x with l and Etot: l is proportional with x, whereas Etot is directly proportional with −x. These obtained results are supported by experimental
and72 simulation results.5 Different types of structural unit numbers are found for
these alloys including FCC, HCP, BCC, and Amor which are completely
consistent with the experimental and theoretical results.5,15,21,23,24

Initially, FeNi alloys with 5324 atoms at different solute concentrations
of Ni, heating rate, temperature, and annealing time were randomly
planted into a cube and then studied by MD method68 with embedded interaction potential SC,1,69−71 Verlet algorithm,72 and
recirculation boundary conditions. 1  where rij is the distance between two atoms i and j; a is the network constant;
ρi is the atomic density i; Etot is the total energy
of the system;
Φ(rij) is the energy
between two atoms i and j; F(ρi) is the interaction
force of atom i; rc =
3.15 Å is the interrupt radius; ε is the energy; and C, m, n, and N are the parameters of FeNi alloys. The parameters of FeNi alloys
are presented in Table 4.

After collecting the samples
of FeNi alloys with different solute
concentrations, x = 10% (Fe90Ni10), 20% (Fe80Ni20), 30% (Fe70Ni30), 40% (Fe60Ni40), and 50% (Fe50Ni50), Fe70Ni30, the heating
rates are 4 × 1012, 4 × 1013, and
4 × 1014 K/s at T = 300 K; for the
Fe70Ni30 sample, T = 300, 400,
500, 600, 700, 900, 1100, and 1300 K; t = 450 ps
(corresponding to the moving step number of 1.8 × 105 steps; time of each step is of 2.5 fs) at T = 600
K. The temperatures of all samples were increased from 0 K to 2500
K to break the initial crystalline structure state and moved to a
liquid state. When the temperature is conducted to 2500 K, the samples
were cooled to different temperatures of 1300, 1100, 900, 700, 600,
500, 400, and 300 K, with the same heating rate, to switch from the
liquid to crystalline state. The crystallization process of FeNi alloys
is investigated through RDF, size (l), total energy
of the system (Etot), structure (through
shape, size, and relationship between the temperature (T) and Etot). CNA73 is used to determine the structure unit number of FCC, HCP, BCC,
and Amor structures, and the heating rate process of FeNi alloys is
carried out by the Nosé–Hoover temperature regulator.74,75
