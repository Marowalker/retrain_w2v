Butanol
is attracting more attention as an alternative fuel. The
performance and emissions of butanol/ethanol–gasoline (E10)
was investigated in a spark ignition engine. Exhaust gas recirculation
(EGR) was employed to improve the engine performance and emissions
in this reported test. The experimental results showed that high brake
thermal efficiency (BTE) was observed with a high proportion of blended
fuels in comparison to E10. During EGR operation, the introduction
of butanol changed the combustion behavior, including prolonged ignition
delay, shortened rapid burning duration, a reduced knock number, and
knock intensity. The brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased
with butanol addition, and when EGR was introduced, it decreased similarly
to E10. The butanol–E10 blends exhibited lower exhaust gas
temperature in comparison to E10 at various EGR rates. Hydrocarbon
emissions from the blends increased slightly with the increased EGR
rate, whereas CO emissions decreased. EGR exhibited high inhibition
of NOx emissions for both blended fuels
and E10, which were reduced by more than 80%. The NOx emissions from the blended fuels were 20–30% less than
that of E10 with or without EGR conditions. Finally, EGR contributed
to a reduction in BSFC and improvement in BTE for the butanol–E10
engine. The butanol–E10 blends exhibited a similar power performance,
slightly reduced combustion stability, and acceptable emissions with
respect to the baseline conditions.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Fossil fuel is an important
source of energy as well as a chemical
raw material, serving a variety of anthropogenic activities. Transportation
consumes more than 25% of the world’s petroleum resources and
produces a large amount of carbon dioxide emissions and pollutant
emissions.1,2 One feasible short-to-midterm solution to
the overdependence on fossil fuels is to replace them with renewable
bioalcohol fuels.3,4 Biofuels can be made from plants,
sugars, grains, plant fibers, and other natural materials. Bioethanol
is already utilized in Brazil, the United States, China, and other
nations.5,6 Anhydrous bioethanol–gasoline (ethanol
10% by volume), containing bioethanol mainly produced by corn, is
available on the Chinese market. There are indeed millions of cars
running on ethanol–gasoline (E10) in several provinces of China
today. Arguably, there will be tens of millions of vehicles fueled
with ethanol–gasoline in the future as regulations grow ever
stricter regarding petroleum consumption and dependence. Bioalcohols
are carbon-containing, so they are intermediate products of the carbon
cycle. Carbon-containing biofuels are known to significantly reduce
carbon emissions.7,8

Bioethanol has been accepted
and widely used as an additive source
of transportation fuel.9 Ethanol–gasoline
can reduce engine-out emissions such as CO, hydrocarbon (HC), and
particles.10,11 Ethanol’s octane number
is higher than that of gasoline, which reduces the knock tendency.
Ethanol’s heat of vaporization (HOV) is also about three to
four times higher relative to gasoline, which enhances the volumetric
efficiency owing to the cooling effect on intake charge. However,
its higher HOV negatively influences fuel evaporation and atomization.12 The ethanol has a higher laminar flow speed
(LFS) relative to gasoline, which is beneficial to extract useful
work in the expansion stroke owing to an improvement in concentrated
heat release.13 However, there is a penalty
of fuel economy owing to ethanol’s low energy content. The
three-way catalytic under ethanol–gasoline conditions, however,
has conversion efficiency as high as that under gasoline conditions.14

Biofuel addition to gasoline has been
gradually accepted by the
global market.15,16 In addition to bioethanol, biobutanol
is a promising biofuel.17 There are four
isomers for butanol: n-butanol, isobutane, sec-butanol, tert-butanol, and saturated
alcohols with four carbon atoms in butanol.18,19 1-Butanol is acknowledged as a type of n-butanol
wherein there is a unbent-chain composition with −OH on the
end carbon.20 Biobutanol is considered
to be the next generation of renewable fuel; it has similar combustion
properties to gasoline, is less corrosive than ethanol, and has lower
vapor pressure, making it markedly safer.21,22 The physical and chemical properties (e.g., high octane number,
oxygen content) of butanol make it very suitable as an alternative
fuel. It has been shown to optimize ignition timing to significantly
improve engine efficiency over other biofuels.23 Butanol addition also reduces engine-out pollutant emissions,
such as unburnt HC and carbon monoxide (CO) and has low coefficient
of variation (COV) of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP).24−26 Its high HOV and low adiabatic flame temperature also help to minimize
NOx emissions. However, butanol exerts
some negative effects on the engine including cold start issues. Although
the low heating value (LHV) of n-butanol is high
relative to ethanol or methanol, it is still lower than that of gasoline,
resulting in a fuel consumption penalty in high-proportion butanol–gasoline
blends.27

Exhaust gas recirculation
(EGR) technology is applied to spark
ignition (SI) engines to minimize NOx emissions
by reducing combustion temperatures.28,29 EGR technology
also improves the engine thermal efficiency because of a decrease
in throttle loss and heat transfer losses to the chamber surfaces
under partial loads.30,31 The specific heat of the working
fluid increases because of the introduced EGR and contains large amounts
of triatomic gas, which contributes to useful work extraction in the
working stroke.32 Moreover, EGR is beneficial
to reduce the engine knock tendency and optimize ignition timing to
improve engine thermal efficiency. However, the inactive gas in EGR
slows down the combustion process and leads to reduced combustion
stability; this is why it is impossible to further increase the EGR
rate.33,34

The purpose of this paper is to appraise
and further understand
the effect of biobutanol addition on an ethanol–gasoline (E10)
engine. In terms of performance improvement and exhaust emissions
reduction, the potential benefits of EGR technology is evaluated in
conjunction with a butanol/ethanol–gasoline blend in an SI
engine.

2 Experiment Setup
2.1 Engine
and Instrumentation
This study
was carried out in a single-cylinder, naturally aspirated, SI engine.
The schematic of the experimental system is illustrated in Figure 1. The engine specifications
are illustrated in Table 1. The engine crankshaft coupled with an ergometer (Mai-kai
CW50) controlled the engine speed and torque. An externally cooled
EGR unit was employed to allow tail-pipe gas to flow into the intake
manifold, employing a manual EGR valve to control the flow rate. Engine
exhaust emissions were measured through a five-gas emissions analyzer
(AVL Digi 4000) and these included CO, NOx, and UHC. Engine intake flow was measured using an air mass flow
sensor (BOSCH HFM5) and an intake pressure sensor (Kistler 601CBA).
Fuel flow was measured through a fuel meter (SHNRJ FCM-D). The cylinder
pressure was measured through a piezoelectric sensor (Kistler 6124A)
fixed on the engine cylinder head, and cylinder pressure signal was
collected and calculated using a combustion analyzer (Kistler KiBox).
An optimal encoder with 0.6° resolution was used to measure the
crankshaft speed. A general engine electronic control unit (ECU) was
employed to manipulate the throttle position, fuel injection, and
spark timing of the engine.

2.2 Experimental Procedures
In the reported
research, the engine speed was fixed at 2300 rpm/min and the manifold
absolute pressure (MAP) was kept at 78 kPa. The EGR dilution was performed
by controlling the EGR gas flow rate using an EGR valve. During EGR
operation, the fuel–air mixture was maintained at a set stoichiometric
ratio and was controlled in a closed loop by the ECU and an oxygen
sensor (BOSCH LSU4.9) attached to the tail pipe. The EGR gas was cooled
using a cooling unit so that the temperature of the EGR gas was not
higher than 320 K. After the engine was started, it was warmed up
for approx. 30 min until the cooling water warmed up. During the experiment,
the temperature of the engine cooling water was controlled between
80 and 90 °C.

High-purity 99.5% n-Butanol
was used in the experiments. The additive was added to the ethanol–gasoline
in a volume ratio of 15 and 30%. The properties of the fuel are illustrated
in Table 2. Butanol’s
energy density is about 23% lower than gasoline, so it was necessary
to improve the pulse width of fuel injection to achieve stable engine
power output.

The burning
characteristics of the engine were determined as per
the collected in-cylinder pressures. A consecutive 200 cycles were
collected to assess burning behaviors and combustion stability.

The cylinder pressure data for 200 cycles were collected and analyzed,
and these data were used to calculate the COV of IMEP. The formula
for calculating the COV is as follows 1  where PIMEP is
the IMEP value and σIMEP is the standard deviation.

The EGR rate was calculated according to the CO2 concentration
in the intake and the CO2 concentration in the exhaust
gas. The calculation formula for the EGR is as follows 2  where CO2in is the CO2 concentration
of intake air, CO2ex is
the CO2 concentration of exhaust gas.

3 Results and Discussion
The cylinder pressures in the chamber
when using blended fuels
are shown in Figure 2. As shown, the engine speed was 2300 rpm/min and the MAP was 78
kPa. The engine cylinder pressure developed with the blended fuels
exhibited a small decrease and retardation in comparison to E10. The
energy density of butanol is lower relative to E10 because the LHV
of n-butanol is about 23% lower compared with gasoline
(n-butanol 33.1 MJ/kg, ethanol–gasoline 41.3
MJ/kg). This meant that when butanol was present, more fuel needed
to be sprayed into the engine to maintain the engine power performance.
The theoretical air–fuel ratio of blended fuels decreased because
of the addition of butanol. In addition, n-butanol’
s latent HOV is high (380–500 and 716 kJ/kg for gasoline and
butanol, respectively), contributing to lower cylinder temperatures
and retarded maximum pressure.

Figure 2 Effects of EGR and blends on in-cylinder
pressure.

The EGR generally produces reduced
combustion stability in SI engines.
In this reported test, the combustion stability of the butanol–E10
blends was measured and evaluated. The COV of blended fuels is demonstrated
in Figure 3. As can
be observed in this figure, there was a small increase in the COV
for blended fuels during EGR operation. The combustion stability of
ethanol–gasoline was better than the butanol–gasoline
blends with small EGR rates (less than 20%). At high EGR rates, the
COV of the blended fuel was similar to that of ethanol–gasoline.
Butanol has a much higher viscosity and higher HOV than gasoline,
so the fuel injection and atomization of the blended fuels degraded
with the addition of butanol,7,12 which produced a lower
quality mixture with slightly worse combustion stability.

Figure 3 COV of IMEP
under EGR conditions.

The peak cylinder pressure
distribution under EGR conditions is
shown in Figure 4.
As shown, the cylinder pressure distribution was more concentrated
in the low-proportion blends than in high-proportion blends without
EGR conditions. During EGR operation, the cylinder pressure distribution
for high proportion blends was more concentrated. The oxygen content
of butanol contributed to the combustion, especially at the high EGR
rate when the concentration of oxygen in the cylinder was lower. The
laminar flame speed of butanol is higher relative to gasoline. At
high EGR rates, the COV of the blends was similar to that of ethanol–gasoline,
possibly owing to the higher oxygen content of blended fuels and their
higher laminar flame speed in comparation with E10.

with and without EGR (300 consecutive
cycles). (a) Pmax distribution for nB15E10;
(b) Pmax distribution for nB30E10.

The combustion process of the
butanol–E10 blends was evaluated
and the results are shown in Figure 5 with ignition delay (CA0-10) and rapid burning duration
(CA10-90). During the EGR operation, the ignition delays of blended
fuels were significantly longer than those of E10. However, the rapid
burning duration of blended fuels was slightly less than that of E10
at a high EGR rate. Butanol’s high HOV and viscosity caused
a reduction in the equality of the mixture, and the mixture temperature
in the chamber was reduced, which produced a slower combustion at
the initial stage of combustion and an increase in CA0-10.12 In addition, the oxygen content of butanol and
its higher laminar flame velocity increased the velocity of flame
propagation during EGR operation, so the rapid burning duration of
blended fuels was slightly shorter than ethanol–gasoline.

of burning durations for blended fuels. (a) Flame development
duration (CA0-10). (b) Rapid development duration (CA10-50).

Engine knock using the blended fuels was evaluated
and the results
are shown in Figures 6 and 7. As shown in this figure, when knock
occurs during the combustion progress, the cylinder pressure curve
is accompanied by pressure oscillation. The knock index decreased
with the increased butanol ratio in the blended fuels, and the engine
knock tendency of the high-proportion blends was smaller than that
of the low-proportion blends. For both high and low proportions of
blended fuels, the EGR exhibited significant suppression in the knock
number and its intensity. As the octane number of butanol is slightly
higher relative to gasoline, the knock of the high-proportion blends
was reduced. The suppression of knock by the EGR contributed to optimization
of the ignition timing and improvement in the engine thermal efficiency.28 In addition, in modern engine control, a light
knock is used to improve engine thermal efficiency, but it is required
to avoid heavy knock that could damage the engine.35

blends. (a) KPEAK value of nB30E10 (300 consequent cycles). (b) Pressure in-cylinder
of nB30E10 (KPEAK 0.9).

The brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of blended
fuels is
demonstrated in Figure 8. When compared to ethanol–gasoline, the BSFC of the blended
fuels was higher. As the content of butanol was increased, the BSFC
continued to increase. The increase in BSFC was due to butanol’s
lower energy density relative to gasoline. For the blended fuels,
the EGR clearly reduced the BSFC because of a decrease in throttling
loss and heat transfer loss.33 The brake
thermal efficiency (BTE) of the engine is shown in Figure 9. The BTE of the engine with
high-proportion blends was closer to E10. The BTE increased when high
quantities of butanol were present in the blended fuels. For blended
fuels, the gas temperature in the chamber decreased, and this decrease
in the temperature in the cylinder was reflected by the decrease of
the exhaust temperature (Figure 10); the reduced heat transfer to the chamber surface
contributed to improve BTE.

Figure 8 Comparation of BSFC for blended fuels under
EGR conditions.

Figure 9 Comparation of BTE for blended fuels under EGR
conditions.

Figure 10 Comparation of exhaust gas temperature
under EGR conditions.

The exhaust gas temperature
of the engine run on the blended fuels
was measured and the results are shown in Figure 10. As shown, during the EGR operation, the
exhaust gas temperature for the blended fuels was lower than that
of E10. EGR caused the exhaust gas temperature to decrease significantly.
The results were consistent with previous research about alcohol addition.26,27 When run on blended fuels, the engine’s exhaust temperature
was lower than on E10 with or without EGR. With the increased blending
ratio, the temperature of the engine exhaust gas further decreased.
The reduced energy density of the blended fuels caused a reduction
in combustion heat release although the reduced stoichiometric ratio
required more fuel. The increased HOV also contributed to low temperature
in the compression stroke. The lower exhaust temperature indicated
a lower in-cylinder temperature, which resulted in less heat transfer
losses to chamber surfaces and a higher engine thermal efficiency.

The engine gaseous emissions were measured. The unburnt HC emissions
are shown in Figure 11. Unburnt HC emissions increased slightly when the EGR was used.
At high EGR rates, HC emissions using the blended fuels increased
significantly over those when E10 was used. During EGR operation,
the temperature in the cylinder decreased, which contributed to a
reduction of the wall temperature, and an increased quenching effect
of the cylinder wall produced more HC emissions.36 In addition, the reduced in-cylinder temperature with blended
fuels also produced increased HC emissions.

Figure 11 Comparation of HC emissions
from blended fuels.

The CO emissions from
blended fuels are shown in Figure 12. The CO emissions from blended
fuels were slightly lower in comparison to E10. The addition of butanol
increased the oxygen content of the blended fuels, which in turn increased
the oxidation of CO in the late burning stage.37 At the same time, the engine adopted a closed-loop control
strategy through the oxygen sensor (fixed in the tail-pipe), and the
fuel injection pulse width was determined from the oxygen concentration
in the exhaust gas. This resulted in a small change in the concentration
of CO emissions.

Figure 12 Comparation of CO emissions from blended fuels.

The NOx emissions from
the exhaust
tailpipe are shown in Figures 13 and 14. As shown, the NOx emissions for blended fuels was reduced
during EGR operation. The butanol–E10 blends had lower NOx emissions than E10. Under EGR condition,
the burning temperature and oxygen content in the cylinder were both
decreased, which produced a significant reduction in NOx emissions. A high cylinder temperature and an oxygen-enriched
environment are the key factors in the formation of NOx.28,31 EGR operation reduces both the
burning temperature and oxygen concentration in the chamber, leading
to a significant reduction in NOx formation.
Compared to E10, the combustion temperature of the blended fuel was
lower, which also contributed to the reduction of NOx. EGR operation can reduce NOx emissions
by more than 80% and use of blended fuels reduced NOx emissions by 20–30% compared to E10.

Figure 13 Comparation of NOx emissions from blended
fuels.

Figure 14 Torque, BSFC, and BTE of blended fuels
under different loads.

The torque, BSFC, and
BTE of the engine under different loads were
measured and the results are shown in Figure 12. The throttle opening was increased from
20 to 60%. The data showed that the butanol/ethanol–gasoline
yielded a torque output that was comparable to E10. At high loads,
the engine BSFC decreased and higher thermal efficiency was achieved.
The BSFC of the high proportion blends was closer to E10 under various
loads. For the blended fuels, the heat transfer losses from the engine
decreased, which improved the thermal efficiency. In addition, the
duration of the combustion of the blended fuels was shortened, because
the combustion heat release was more concentrated, which also improved
the thermal efficiency of the engine.

4 Conclusions
In this reported research, the combustion and pollutants in an
SI engine with butanol/ethanol–gasoline were investigated.
EGR was employed to enhance the fuel economy of the butanol–E10
engine. The basic conclusions of this study are as follows:

Butanol/ethanol–gasoline exhibited an extended ignition
delay and shorter CA10-90 than E10 during EGR operation. Butanol–E10
blends showed a slightly lower combustion stability. The addition
of butanol reduced the engine knock tendency, and the intensity and
frequency of the knock for the high-proportion blends was reduced
clearly.

The butanol–E10 blends exhibited a power performance
that
was similar to that of E10. The BSFC of blended fuels was higher relative
to E10 because of its lower energy density. The BTE of high-proportion
blended fuels was higher than low-proportion blends and was closer
to that of E10.

The NOx emissions
of butanol/ethanol–gasoline
blends were greatly reduced. At the high EGR rate, the NOx emissions were reduced by more than 80%. The butanol–E10
mixture emitted 20–30% less NOx than E10. The HC emissions from the butanol blends increased slightly
with increased EGR rate, and was slightly higher than E10. CO emissions
were slightly less for the blended fuels than for E10. EGR had little
effect on CO emissions for blended fuels.

In summary, the butanol–E10
engine had an output power that
was comparable to that of the E10 engine. Use of EGR technology can
improve the fuel economy of the butanol–E10 engine and can
provide an acceptable BTE. Overall, there appeared to be reduced exhaust
emissions from engines with blended fuels.
