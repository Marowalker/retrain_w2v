Organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs), in general, require multilayer
devices and microcavity structures for emission tuning, which increases
the complexity and cost of production. Hence, it is imperative to
develop techniques for spectral tuning, which employ simplified device
structures. In this study, we have selected a tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum
(Alq3): 10-(2-benzothiazolyl)-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1,1,7,7-tetramethyl-1H,5H,11H-(1)benzopyropyrano
(6,7-8-i,j)quinolizin-11-one (C545T)-based
OLED and investigated the dependence of the OLED emission on various
deposition parameters and the electrical bias. The concentration of
the dopant in the emissive layer (EML) was varied from 3 to 50%, and
the single dopant emitter as a limiting case was also studied along
with studies on the varied deposition rates and EML thickness. By
varying the deposition parameters, the emission was observed to change
from excitonic green to excimeric yellow. With increased doping concentration,
reduction in pure exciton emission with an increase in excimer emission
was observed, resulting in electroluminescent spectral red shift.
Similarly, electroluminescence spectra have shown different levels
of broadening, depending on the deposition rate and thickness of the
EML. These effects could be reversed with increasing applied electric
field. Thus, it is indicated that, by suitably optimizing the deposition
parameters of the dopant material, spectral tuning can easily be obtained,
which may form the basis of simplified and cost-effective device structures.

Introduction
The first reported
organic light-emitting diode (OLED) with a doped
emission layer (EML) consisted of tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum
(Alq3) as the host and a coumarin derivative and DCM (4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran) as the dopant.1 Doping
the Alq3 host with a suitable dopant is found to cause
considerable gain in electroluminescence (EL) efficiency as well as
in device lifetime. In a host-dopant matrix, carrier transport properties
can also be tuned separately. The optimal dopant concentration in
fluorescent OLEDs is found to be typically below 5%. At a low dopant
level, an excited state complex or exciplex, which is only bound to
the excited state, can form between the dopant dye and the host material
in the host-guest matrix due to the charge transfer or energy transfer
from either host to guest or vice versa. On the other hand, with increased
dopant concentration in the host-guest matrix, a decrease in emission
intensity and red shift to the emission peak was observed, which was
attributed to a possible excimer emission.1 As the dopant concentration increases, dye molecules begin to form
aggregates, leading to self-quenching and thereby emission loss. This
can often comprise the nonemissive excimer formation, where the exciton
is delocalized over two dopant molecules.2 The dimer formed in the excited state is not bound to the ground
state and dissociates upon relaxation. The emission from the excimer,
if any, generally would have the characteristics of low quantum efficiency
and a broadened emission spectrum.

Coumarin dye and its several
derivatives have been in use for a
long time in the case of flash lamp pumped organic lasers.3,4 After the introduction of the guest-host emitter system in OLEDs,1 a few coumarin derivatives started appearing
as dopants in the Alq3-based host system,5 which made it one of the earliest group of dopants used
in OLEDs for efficient emission, for example, 3-(2-benzothiazolyl)-7-(diethylamino)-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one, known as C-6,6 which fluoresces at a peak wavelength of 505 nm in EtOH with a 78%
photoluminescence quantum yield.4 The quantum
efficiency was enhanced up to 90% when the C-6 structure was modified
to 10-[2-benzothiazolyl]-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H,5H,11H-benzo-[l]pyrano[6,7,8-i,j]quinolizin-11-one or C545, and the
emission is red-shifted to 519 nm.6 However,
its planar structure caused more aggregation in the solid state as
evidenced by the presence of a long wavelength shoulder in the photoluminescence
(PL) and EL spectra at high concentration.7 Introducing four methyl groups in C545 to reduce the dye–dye
interaction at high concentration led to 10-(2-benzothiazolyl)-1,1,7,7-tetramethyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H,5H,11H-benzo[l] pyrano[6,7,8-i,j]quinolizin-11-one
or C545T,5,8−10 which became the most
commonly used green dopant for Alq3 due to its high luminance
efficiency, unique hue, and less concentration quenching compared
to other derivatives. The OLED emitter with 1% C545T doped with Alq3 is reported to have a current efficiency of 10 cd/A.5 A doping concentration of 2% C545T has recorded
very fast energy transfer and maximum PL efficiency in a study, where
the doping concentration is varied from 1 to 5%.11 Increasing the dopant concentration up to 7% resulted in
the dopants forming aggregates and red-shifted EL spectra, along with
reduced radiative decay rate and increased nonradiative decay rate,
suggesting strong nonradiative recombination.12,13 On increasing the dopant concentration further up to 23%, yellow
emission with Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE)
coordinates of (0.45, 0.53) was obtained compared to the (0.29, 0.66)
for a dopant concentration of 1%.14 This
red shift in the emission spectrum is attributed to the C545T excimer
formation and corresponding emission at high dopant concentration.

The dopant emission in a host-dopant emissive system is explained
as the host to guest energy transfer or the direct dopant recombination
due to carrier trapping.15 The highest
device performance was obtained by doping of Alq3 with
low C545T concentration.1,14 However, once the dopant
concentration increases, the dopant monomers may aggregate to form
dimers, and the excited state energy transfer due to dipole–dipole
interaction between the dopants may increase. This may cause excitons
to be trapped in the aggregates without any reverse transfer to the
monomer molecules. This can lead to a radiationless relaxation or
a different radiative relaxation path, causing fluorescence quenching.15 Rhee et al.16 studied
a relatively high doping concentration of the Alq3:C545T
system by considering C545T molecules as charge carrier traps. The
C545T single emitter devices fabricated with EML thicknesses of 30
and 120 nm gave evidence to heavy self-quenching. Whereas the thicker
EML device gave a broad spectrum with a peak at ∼573 nm, the
30 nm-thick EML device exhibited weak C545T exciton emission with
a peak at 530 nm along with strong excimer emission.16 Thus, the previous studies have confirmed the change in
nature of excitons from excitonic to excimer when the dopant concentration
is increased. This is an important observation as the resulting spectral
shift can be utilized in tuning the OLED emission with a simplified
device stack. This potential can be extended to design and fabricate
efficient white OLED with reduced process complexity. Nevertheless,
the dependence of this emission tuning on the electric field, rate
of deposition, and thickness of the single dopant emitter layer along
with different concentrations of the dopant in a host-guest system
has not yet been systematically studied. Herein, we study the effect
that the doping concentration is having on the optoelectronic properties
of C545T:Alq3 matrix up to a maximum doping of 50%. C545T
as a single emitter, deposited with varying deposition rates as well
as varied thickness and its effect on the resultant excimer emission
along with its field dependence, is also studied. The Alq3:C545T system is chosen as it is a well-studied system with most
of the material properties already known. There is still a lot of
research interest in this emitter system evinced by several recent
publications.13,14,16−18

Results and Discussions
There are
numerous studies focused on finding the optimized doping
concentration in different EML host-guest units to ensure efficient
energy transfer between the host and the guest. As mentioned in the Introduction, efficient transfer requires very low
dopant concentration. Nevertheless, there are not many reports concentrating
on increased dopant concentration, and the majority of them study
up to 10–20% dopant concentration range. These were aiming
at studying triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) effects19−22 or confirming excimer emission without any other detailed investigation.
The study by Rhee et al.,16 reporting a
thick C545T single emitter, confirmed the excimer emission and studied
the charge trapping. They have studied different percentages of doping
up to 6% and also single emitter devices with two different thicknesses.
This is a detailed study in which the authors probed the change in
exciton formation route from the Förster transfer to direct
charge trapping. However, they have studied only 30 and 120 nm thicknesses
for single emitter devices, and no dependence on deposition rate has
been investigated. Since the deposition rate can affect the molecular
packing, it can, in turn, influence the excimer emission as well.
Ultimately, the effect of the electric field on devices with varied
doping concentration and single emitter devices with varied thickness
and rate of deposition needs to be studied to complete the picture.
In this work, we have systematically studied the effect of increased
doping concentration on the Alq3:C545T system starting
from 3 up to 50%. As a limiting case of this high doping concentration,
we have also studied the C545T single emitter system under different
deposition conditions. Keeping the EML thickness constant, we have
changed the C545T evaporation rate from 0.1 to 5 Å/s. After optimizing
the device for the rate of deposition to extract maximum emission,
the EML thickness is varied in the subsequent part of the study. These
investigations provide further information on the Alq3:C545T
system, which we believe can be a building block for simplified OLED
structures.

Alq3:C545T System Effects of Heavy Doping
Figure S1 shows that the OLED device structure
was fabricated to study the effect of dopant concentration in EML.
Here, OLEDs are fabricated with Alq3 doped with C545T as
the emitter. The device structure is as follows. ITO/N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)-benzidine (NPB) (40 nm)/Alq3: x wt % of C545T (30 nm)/Alq3 (35 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/ Al, where x = 3, 10, 20, and
50%. As the level of doping increases, a proportional increase in
the current density can be expected. However, interestingly, this
is not the case, as shown in Figure 1a. Current density reduces when the doping is increased
from 3 to 10%. This is recovered when the doping is at 20% and then
increases further by 50% doping. This is not the trend followed by
the luminance, which steadily decreases with an increase in doping,
as shown in Figure 1b. The same trend is followed by the current efficiency, as shown
in Figure 1b. It is
already reported that the current density increases with dopant concentration,
at low doping concentrations.12 As the
doping concentration further increases, the emission mechanism changes
from excitonic to excimer, and hence, the current density and luminescence
both decrease. However, above 10% doping, the hole transport nature
of C545T becomes dominant, and hence, the total current increases.
However, there is no consequent increase in luminescence because the
excimer emission is not very efficient.

and (b) current density–luminance–current
efficiency characteristics of devices with different doping concentrations.
(c) Photoluminescence spectra of C545T-doped Alq3 thin
films with doping concentrations of 5 and 50%. (d) Normalized electroluminescence
spectrum of the C545T:Alq3 device with different doping
concentrations ranging from 3 to 50%.

Going up to 10%, current efficiency is reduced by half and is further
reduced with an increase in doping. The variation of current efficiency
with current density is also worth studying. The current efficiency
increases with current density for 3% doping, which indicates the
enhancement in emission due to the TTA effect, as suggested by Luo
and Aziz.23 For the 10% doped device, the
current efficiency remains almost constant upon increasing the current
density. Above 10% doping, no effect of TTA is previously reported.16 So, the effect of TTA can be expected not to
influence the emission of OLED with heavy doping of C545T. Corroborating
this observation, the current efficiency, in fact, decreases with
increasing current density for 20 and 50% doped devices, as can be
seen in Figure1b.

The change from the expected trend in current density can be attributed
to the change in carrier injection capabilities with variation in
the doping level. When doping increases, along with aggregation, there
may be a change in dipole–dipole interaction locally.24 This change in polarization can reduce the band
gap, which makes the excimer emission at long wavelength unpredictable
due to the interplay of several mechanisms. The variation of external
quantum efficiency with current density is given in Figure S2, which also shows more or less the same trend as
that of current efficiency. The variation of power efficiency with
operating voltage is shown in Figure S3. The power efficiency is also seen to be decreasing with increased
dopant concentration, which is expected as the luminescence at a given
voltage is lesser for heavily doped samples.

However, it may
be noted that these devices are not in the standard
OLED architecture with hole injection, electron blocking, hole blocking,
and doped transport layers. Hence, efficiency values are expected
to be low, while we are more interested in the emission spectrum.

Figure 1c shows
the PL spectrum of 5 and 50% C545T-doped Alq3 thin films.
When the doping concentration increases, the 574 nm shoulder in the
5% doped film, which is due to excimer emission, becomes dominant
compared to the 528 nm peak, which is the excitonic emission. This
relative intensity difference between the two peaks of emission spectra
for the two differently doped films can be attributed to the aggregation-induced
effect of the C545T molecule in the film. The C545T dopant concentration
in Alq3 host thus has a keen effect on the EL spectrum
as well as the device efficiency. With the increase in doping concentration,
the spectrum is red-shifted along with a distinct decrease in device
efficiency. This is also evident from the normalized thin film PL
spectra attributed to the excimer emission of the dopant.1 It is well established that electroluminescence
and photoluminescence may not be identical since the former is basically
an optical property, whereas the latter involves several electronic
properties as well. We have earlier reported that the major part of
the recombination happens near the HTL/EML interface due to piling
up of holes near this interface.25 In PL,
we might be able to tap all the excimers, whereas in EL, only the
excimers near the HTL/EML interface can lead to excimer emission;
thus, excitonic emission may still dominate. Carrier trapping, which
might happen, may also be confined near the interface due to the low
hole mobility of Alq3. The C545T clusters away from the
interface are not getting a chance to get excited either by trapping
or by direct energy transfer. The relatively narrower EL spectrum
points to a weak microcavity effect also because the latter has been
used to enhance color purity by narrowing the emission spectrum.26

In the electroluminescence spectrum in Figure 1d, when the dopant
concentration is varied
from 3 to 10% and then to 20%, there is a slight widening of the spectra
and it is red-shifted as well.

The 574 nm shoulder is attributed
to the excimer emission as per
the previous reports.11−14 It may be noted that there is one report suggesting this red-shifted
emission to be due to the Förster transfer.13 The excimer emission is usually bathochromically shifted
compared with usual fluorescence so that there is almost no overlap
between the emission and absorption. To verify this, we studied the
absorption and emission of C545T films and found out that there is
very little overlap. Comparison of PL emission and absorption of the
C545T film is provided in Figure S4. Also,
we have fabricated C545T-only devices, and they also showed this red-shifted
emission around 574 nm (also shown in Figure S4), which indicates that it has excimer origins, as shown in the subsequent
section. This 574 nm emission is not as distinct in EL as it is in
PL.

The relative intensity between the peak and the shoulder
decreases
with doping. When doping goes from 3 to 50%, the relative intensity
is almost halved. Up to 10% doping, quenching increases. However,
above 10%, even though direct capture of charge carriers increases
as proposed by Rhee et al.,16 the increase
in local current density only contributes toward the nonradiative
recombination current, Jnr. Therefore,
the charge balance also deteriorates for heavily doped devices. Here,
the charge imbalance and the nonradiative pathway compete with the
excimer pathway.

With the increase in doping percentage, luminance
decreases as
expected. This is attributed to the concentration quenching due to
dye molecule aggregation. As can be seen in Figure S5 and Figure 2a, CIE (x, y) coordinates are shifting
toward the yellow region from green with an increase in doping concentration.
When the external bias is increased, the CIE coordinates tend to return
to the green region as indicated in the CIE chart. This indicates
the decreased emission from the aggregate with an increased applied
electric field. It may also be due to the field induced dissociation
of the aggregate, as suggested by Wortmann et al.27 As the charge carriers can easily overcome the energy barrier
at the higher applied electric field, the probability of charge transfer
may increase, leading to fast exciton dissociation. Another reason
for this blue-shifted emission at higher fields may be the generation
of high energy excitons, as proposed by Shao and Yang.28

Figure 2 (a) CIE x and y coordinates
with
voltage for different doping concentration. (b) Normalized EL spectra
with change in voltage for 3%. (c) Normalized EL spectra with change
in voltage for 50% doping.

Field dependence of color coordinates is seen to increase with
doping concentration. At heavy doping, the emission mechanism follows
a different pathway. However, even this change in the favored pathway
is influenced by bias voltage, as shown in Figure 2b. Apparently, for the heavily doped device,
with increased bias, the emission tries to revert to the 3% emission
range, which is the new predominant emission mechanism with the excimer
weakened. However, direct capture may prevail. The polarization effects
are diminished at high bias along with the reduced excimer emission.
Excimer dissociation, as well as reduced charge balance or generation
of high energy excitons, may be the reason. The reduction in the 574
nm shoulder at high bias is prominent in a 50% doped device, as shown
in Figure 2c.

Increasing dopant concentration and decreasing the band gap may
decrease electric field-induced fluorescence quenching.29 When the current increases, charge carrier-induced
quenching is also possible. With the decrease in the band gap, field-induced
quenching decreases. By narrowing the energy gap, the excited states
are less prone to dissociation. Aggregation may reduce the band gap
as previously reported, and hence, quenching decreases initially with
a small increase in doping concentration.27 However, with the further increase in concentration, trapping increases,
which supports nonradiative pathways. An increase in current density
without a corresponding increase in luminance can be explained as
above.

Above a certain percentage of doping, concentration quenching
and
luminescence due to direct charge trapping compete with each other.
The 3% doped device exhibits an excellent charge balance using the
direct excitation and energy transfer mechanisms. In the case of 10%
doping, current density decreases because of the enhancement in charge
trapping. For 20% doping, aggregation changes the band gap and assists
in carrier transport. The same phenomenon continues with 50%, and
current increases due to direct injection into C545T, which does not
contribute toward luminescence due to concentration quenching. Thus,
aggregation is perceived to be playing a role in defining the optoelectronic
properties of these devices. In a solution, we can study aggregation
by increasing the concentration, but in a thin film, which is already
a condensed formed, the only way to change the packing is by changing
the deposition rate. Hence, we further studied a variation of the
rate of evaporation of C545T in a single emitter device.

C545T Single
Emitter
I. Effect of Variation of the Evaporation Rate of C545T
There has not been any comprehensive study on the effect of evaporation
rate on C545T single emitter devices. The available works only confirm
the presence of excimer emission at higher doping.16 Effect of aggregation whatsoever is expected to be aggravated
at a higher evaporation rate. Accordingly, as the rate increases,
the shoulders in the doped devices are expected to broaden. The polarization
effects also should become maximized. Here, we are studying the C545T
single emitter as a limiting case of high doping. A single layer of
C545T with a thickness of 30 nm is deposited as the emission layer
(EML) of OLED at rates of 0.1, 2, and 5 Å/s. The PL emission
from the C545T thin film is compared with PL emission from C545T solution
also. Figure 3a shows
the PL spectrum of C545T in solution (chloroform) and for a neat film
of 30 nm thickness. The 503 nm peak wavelength for the C545T emission
in solution is shifted toward ∼586 nm for the neat film deposited
at a rate of 2 Å/s. Both the solution and film have a shoulder
at 532 nm. As mentioned in the previous section, this red shift of
the major peak may be attributed to the excimer formation of the C545T
dye. There is also a possibility of a solid-state solvation effect,
which can cause a spectral red shift induced by the change in local
polarization and thereby the local electric field.24,30 Due to the close packing, the C545T molecule can self-polarize,
thereby increasing the local polarization field. This polarization
also can contribute toward the red-shifted spectrum. Unlike in the
case of the Alq3:C545T emitter, all the C545T molecules
are surrounded by the neighboring C545T molecules themselves. This
makes the spectrum slightly more red-shifted compared to the Alq3:C545T 50% doped layer.

Figure 3 (a) Photoluminescence spectrum of C545T
in solution and neat C545T
film. (b) Normalized electroluminescence spectrum of the C545T single
emitter device with varying EML deposition rate. (c) Variation of
CIE x and y coordinates with voltage
for different deposition rates. (d) Current density–voltage–luminance
characteristics of the C545T single emitter devices with various EML
deposition rates.

From the electroluminescence
spectra in Figure 3b, the EL spectrum of each of the C545T single
emitter OLED peaks at a wavelength of 532 nm, the shoulder peak in
the PL spectra. Nevertheless, on increasing the deposition rate, the
spectrum widens toward a longer wavelength. This can only arise from
the difference in the molecular packing due to the change in deposition
rate. Slow deposition can lead to nonstructured defects and trapping.
Therefore, the effect of self-polarization might be less at a low
deposition rate. So, the red shift can be comparatively less in this
case. However, the device having EML deposited at a 2 Å/s rate
shows the maximum emission intensity. On further increasing the rate,
the luminescence is reduced. Both of the devices with EML deposited
at 2 and 5 Å/s show similar current densities, while the device
of 0.1 Å/s deposited EML exhibits a poorer performance. The latter
can be attributed to poor morphology of the EML. The CIE color chart
in Figure 3c also shows
a similar trend with EML of 0.1 Å/s, leaning toward a hue that
is more greenish. Both the other devices show closer CIE coordinates
following the trend in EL spectra and J–V–L characteristics with a more
yellowish emission resulting from the broadening of the spectrum.

Whereas the emission of the 0.1 Å/s device is located more
or less in the yellow-green edge in the CIE chart with a dominant
contribution from green, 2 and 5 Å/s devices are giving yellow
emission, as evidenced by the CIE coordinates in Figure 3c. These CIE coordinates of
the 0.1 Å/s device remain almost the same in the whole range
of biasing voltage. Even with this kind of color stability, the 0.1
Å/s is showing very poor device performance, as shown in Figure 3d. It has recorded
a very low current density as well as luminance. This may be due to
the poor film connectivity. Charge transport in thin films has been
studied with respect to the effects of electric field, temperature,
dopant concentration, film morphology, etc. on charge carrier mobility
as well as device functioning. The evaporation rate is definitely
going to affect the morphology and thereby electrical and optical
properties. For example, Lee et al. have reported the variation of
current density of Alq3 films as a function of rate.31

In addition, there are several reports
detailing the effect of
micro- and nanostructural changes emerging from various morphologies
on charge carrier transport from Qiao et al.,32 Liu et al.,33 and Ramos et al.34 We are proposing that varying the deposition
rate changes the molecular packing and film morphology and thereby
the device performance.

However, for the higher rates, they
tend to move toward the green
region in the color chart. These can also be observed in the color
coordinate plot given in Figure S6. This
is also evidenced by the normalized EL spectra at different bias voltages
in Figure 4. The EL
spectrum for 0.1 Å/s remains the same for all voltages, but for
the other two higher rates, the same spectrum is narrowing at the
longer wavelength region with an increase in voltage.

Figure 4 Normalized EL spectra
for different biasing voltages for C545T
single emitter devices with deposition rates of (a) 0.1, (b) 2.0,
and (c) 5.0 Å/s.

As the polarization effects
are minimum, color coordinates remain
unchanged with voltage indicating the absence of any reversible conformation
changes. The poor morphology of 0.1 Å/s also brings about a large
number of traps in the layer. The presence of traps without the smooth
connectivity between the molecules is substantiated by the slight
increase in current density with a negligible enhancement in luminance
when the driving voltage is increased. Due to its conformational weakness,
charge carrier mobility in the layer does suffer. This badly affects
the charge balance in the structure. The connectivity issues and absence
of any local polarization effects cause a virtual depletion effect,
and the possibility of an electron–hole pair is reduced. The
fraction of dimers formed on deposition of the layer may emit relatively
weakly, but the exciton emission is the only pathway that gets benefitted
by the increase in carrier injection due to the increase in voltage,
which is again negligible. All other aggregate excited states follow
a nonradiative pathway with an increase in the electric field. Only
a minimal number of excitons and excimers are formed, and the dominant
fraction of them relaxes nonradiatively.

On the other hand,
2 and 5 Å/s devices show comparable current
density and luminance with 2 Å/s having the relatively high luminance.
However, the EL intensity plot shows a very distinct intensity variation,
even though the spectrum is similar. That is, the 2 Å/s device
favors efficient radiative recombination. Both of the devices have
an EL spectrum, which broadens on longer wavelengths and narrows with
voltage. With a high enough bias, it may give a clean enough emission
spectra like 0.1 Å/s. This broadening in the emission indicates
the presence of excimer emission, which again is being suppressed
with the increase in voltage. The packing in the 2 Å/s film seems
to provide more radiative recombination centers. The 2 Å/s film
is probably having more trap-assisted recombination due to its relatively
loose packing compared to the 5 Å/s film. This combined with
the improved carrier mobility for holes16 due to better connectivity may reduce the charge carrier balance
for the 5 Å/s device.

II. Effect of Variation of C545T Thickness
The device
with EML deposited at 2 Å/s was found to be the most efficient
in the previous section, and now, the next part of the study is to
find out the effect of different thicknesses on the emission. The
EML thickness is varied to be 10, 20, 30, 60, and 70 nm. The device
structure remains the same. As the hole blocking on the ETL side is
negligible, a lesser EML thickness can cause the exciton recombination
zone to be shifted toward ETL. Device characteristics with the increase
in thickness are shown in Figure 5a. The current density decreases initially, as is expected.
However, the 70 nm device shows an unexpectedly high current density.
However, this enhancement in current density is not getting proportionally
translated to luminescence. Therefore, this increase in current density
contributes toward a nonradiative recombination current. The luminescence
in general also decreases with an increase in thickness, the only
exception being the 30 nm device. This can be associated with a weak
microcavity effect in this configuration. This is evidenced by the
EL spectra of the same in Figure 5b.

Figure 5 (a) Current density–voltage–luminance characteristics
of the C545T single emitter OLED with varying EML thickness. (b) Normalized
electroluminescence spectrum for different EML thickness. (c) Variation
of CIE x and y coordinates with
voltage for different EML thickness.

In the normalized EL spectrum recorded at 8 V, the devices with
EML thicknesses of 10 and 20 nm have a peak wavelength of 532 nm with
an ∼565 nm shoulder. This 565 nm shoulder peak is higher for
the 20 nm device. The 30 nm device has a comparatively narrower spectrum
with a peak wavelength of 532 nm. It also has the highest spectral
intensity. This may be due to the weak microcavity effect at this
30 nm optimized EML thickness. For the 60 nm device, the EL peak is
slightly shifted to 536 nm with a strong shoulder at 562 nm. This
trend is followed by the 70 nm device, whose total broadening of the
spectra and the strengthening of the shoulder result in a 560 nm peak.

The effect of this EL spectra shift and broadening is distinct
in the CIE chart in Figure 5c. With the increase in EML thickness, the CIE (x, y) coordinates are moving toward the yellow region
with the 70 nm device tending toward a yellow-red color. The latter
exhibits a pure yellow hue and the weakest luminance for a given current
density (Figure 5a).
The 30 nm device has the maximum luminescence intensity with all others
falling in between. It is obvious that, as the EML thickness increases,
the C545T pure excitonic emission decreases, and excimer excitation
increases as evidenced by the change in the relative intensity between
initial 532 and 565 nm peaks, the peak shift, and broadening. Along
with the molecular structure and doping concentration, excimer emission
depends on charge carrier transport as well.16 This can influence the excimer recombination. So, the charge carrier
mobility and the local carrier density can help to improve the excimer
emission by reducing C545T emission.35 This
is in congruence with the observation in the previous section.

The 10 nm device shows C545T exciton and excimer peaks. When thickness
increases, the C545T exciton and excimer emission become comparable
at 20 nm. However, for the 30 nm device, both of the emission intensities
increase, but the exciton peak is visibly dominating. This may be
due to a weak microcavity effect as discussed previously. Nevertheless,
the 60 nm device shows a reduced excimer emission, and the 70 nm device
has both peaks with equal intensity. It should be recalled that Rhee
et al. have reported a very weak excitonic and strong excimer emission
for a single emitter device with 120 nm thickness of C545T.16 Combining this with our result, it can be understood
that, beyond 70 nm, the excimer peak starts dominating. As can be
seen in Figure 5c and Figure S7, the emission tries to revert to green
emission at high electric bias for all the range of thicknesses studied.

The current density decreases with an increase in thickness of
up to 30 nm due to the resistive contribution. For the 60 nm device,
the current density is slightly increased. However, the 70 nm device
has reported the highest current density. As the thickness increases,
C545T molecules are grown on a previously deposited C545T layer, passivating
the defects and reducing the traps, which could be the reason for
the slightly higher current density exhibited by the 60 nm device
compared to that of the 30 nm device. This trend is continued for
the 70 nm device, which exhibits the highest current density.

Normalized EL intensities for the OLEDs with different EML thickness
and the driving voltages of 6, 7, and 8 V are given in Figure 6. The peaks corresponding to
10, 20, and 30 nm are 532 nm, and for 60 nm, it is 536 nm. For the
10 and 20 nm devices, the 564 nm shoulder in the peak can be found
to be decreasing with applied voltage. This can be associated with
the effect of applied electric field on the excimer emission as discussed
in the previous sections. However, as it is absent in the thick EML
device, it could be due to the lesser effective applied field. For
the devices with an EML thickness of 30 nm and above, the normalized
EL spectra are unchanged when the applied voltage is changed from
6 to 8 V. Therefore, the contribution to exciton formation remains
the same even at a high applied voltage, which could be the direct
charge trapping by the C545T molecule (532–536 nm) and excimer
emission (564 nm). A summary of the emission characteristics is given
in Table 1.

It may be noted that, though heavy
doping leads to concentration
quenching in the present case, approaches such as using two hosts
having twisted structures with high steric effects have been used
to prevent intermolecular aggregation and to reduce luminescence quenching.36

Conclusions
We
have selected an Alq3:C545T-based OLED as a model
system to systematically study the effect of high doping concentration.
It has been found that increased doping levels lead to increased excimer
emission and reduced excitonic emission. As a limiting case of heavy
doping, single emitter devices with C545T were fabricated with different
evaporation rates. High evaporation rates alter the molecular packing
of the emissive species, and thus, the red-shifted excimer emission
is proven to be arising out of aggregation-induced effects. However,
in both cases, that is, in a host-guest system with heavy doping and
in a dopant-only single emitter device, these effects could be reversed
with high electrical bias. Increased direct charge trapping and field-induced
dissociation of aggregates could be the reason for this behavior.
We have also fabricated dopant-only single emitter devices with different
thicknesses and found that, for a device with a 70 nm thickness, the
contributions from excimer and excitonic emissions are almost equal,
yielding a broad emission spectrum. In this study, it has been demonstrated
that the change in deposition conditions can significantly influence
EL spectra, and by controlling them for the EML, OLED emission could
be tuned between yellow and green by shift in emission peak and spectral
broadening. Here, potential for white emission with this simple stack
design can be explored by inserting a blue emitter.

Experimental
Section
Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (Kintec
Company,
Hong Kong) were cleaned in a liquid detergent solution (Alkanox) and
subsequently sonicated in deionized water and 2-propanol. After drying,
the UV-ozone-treated (Novascan) substrates were loaded into the thermal
evaporation chamber (Angstrom Inc.) under an ∼10–8 Torr vacuum, which is integrated to the glove box. Organic layers
were deposited sequentially at a rate of 1–2 Å/s except
for the dopant materials, whose deposition rate varied with EML composition.
Lithium fluoride (LiF) was deposited at a rate of 0.1 Å/s and
aluminum at 2 Å/s. The final device, with an active device area
of 0.14 cm2, was encapsulated under a nitrogen environment
in the glove box using a UV curable epoxy (Epoxy Technology Inc.),
and the encapsulated devices were taken outside. A Keithley 2400 source
meter combined with a SpectraScan PR655 spectroradiometer (Photo Research
Inc.) interfaced with a PC was used to characterize all the devices.
