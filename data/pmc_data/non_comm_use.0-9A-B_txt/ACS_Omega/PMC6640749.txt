Mesoporous structured
catalysts featuring interfacial activity
are the most promising candidates for biphasic interface catalysis
because their nanopores can concurrently accommodate catalytic active
components and provide countless permeable channels for mass transfer
between the interior and the exterior of Pickering droplets. However,
to date, a convenient and effective strategy for the preparation of
an anchor site-containing interfacial active mesoporous catalyst is
still lacking. In the present work,
we report a novel and efficient interfacial active mesoporous silica
(MS) catalyst, which is prepared by a facile cocondensation of two
types of organosilanes and subsequent anchoring of Pd NPs onto its
surface through the confinement and coordination interactions. The
as-prepared catalyst is then applied as emulsifier to stabilize the
water-in-oil (W/O) Pickering emulsion and investigated as an interfacial
catalyst for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes. An obviously enhanced
rate toward the nitrobenzene hydrogenation is observed for the 0.8
mol% Pd/PAP-functionalized mesoporous silica-20 catalyst in the emulsion
system (both conversion and selectivity are >99% within 30 min)
in
comparison to a single aqueous solution. Moreover, the emulsion catalytic
system can be easily recycled six times without the separation of
the catalyst from the water phase during the recycling process. This
finding demonstrates that the incorporation of phenylaminopropyl trimethoxysilane
amphiphilic groups during the hydrolysis of tetramethyl orthosilicate
not only endows MS with interfacial activity but also improves the
catalytic activity and stability.

1 Introduction
One
kind of liquid dispersed in another kind of liquid in the form
of droplets is called an emulsion; emulsions are seen in many fields
in our daily life.1−3 The associated emulsifiers are commonly used to prohibit
the coalescence between the droplets and to obtain a stable microemulsion
system without the macroscopic phase separation. Apart from the surfactant
molecules, emulsifiers can also be micrometer- or nanometer-scaled
colloidal particles that locate at the liquid–liquid two-phase
interface and generate a protective film between the dispersed and
continuous phases.4−7 These colloidal particle-stabilized emulsions are named “Pickering
emulsions” by Pickering in 1907.8 After that, numerous efforts have been made on developing particulate
emulsifiers for the preparation of Pickering emulsions. The advantages
distinguishing the Pickering emulsion from the conventional emulsions
stabilized by surfactants are its ultrahigh stability, low toxicity,
simple separation, and well-adjustable droplet size.9−13 Considering these characteristics and advantages, the Pickering
emulsion has attracted increasing attention in various fields such
as cosmetics, coatings, foods, crude oil recovery, wastewater treatment,
and biomedical applications.14−19 Beyond all this, the heterogeneous catalysts based on Pickering
emulsion have also received widespread attention in hydrogenation,
oxidation, biomass conversion, esterification reactions, and so forth.20−23

Over the past decade, it has been demonstrated that the Pickering
emulsion plays an accelerating effect by virtue of solubilization
of the hydrophobic substrates in an aqueous solution followed by their
activation by the surface-assembled catalyst in the interior or exterior
of the droplets. Furthermore, the product is dissolved in the organic
phase, and the catalyst is located in the aqueous phase after centrifugation,
thus simplifying the product isolation and catalyst recycling. In
general, the frequently used approach for the synthesis of amphiphilic
nanocomposites adopts harsh conditions
or tedious postgrafting methods. For example, Resasco and co-workers
prepared a variety of amphiphilic hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) by fusing
hydrophobic carbon nanotubes to hydrophilic inorganic NPs (SiO2, MgO, NaX, and Al2O3) and then supported
precious-metal NPs for biofuel upgrade, glucose cascade, and F–T
synthesis.24−27 Qi et al. have prepared an amphiphilic Janus particle through multistep
region-selective modification toward the oil/water two-phase enzyme
catalysis.28 Recently, our groups have
successfully prepared an interfacial active mesoporous silica (MS)
catalyst through functionalization with octyl groups, which shows
dramatically enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of aqueous
olefins. However, the preparation procedure of the MS catalyst requires
a step-by-step hydrolysis pathway, and the mesoporous internal/external
surfaces lack amino or other functional groups for the stabilization
of precious-metal NPs.29 Therefore, it
is highly desirable to develop a straightforward and mild reaction
strategy to fabricate an interfacial active MS catalyst whose internal/external
surfaces have abundant amino groups anchoring sites.

Inspired by these
approaches, herein we describe the synthesis of a novel and efficient
interfacial active mesoporous catalyst, where interfacial active MS
is generated in situ by a simple cocondensation of tetramethyl orthosilicate
(TMOS) and phenylaminopropyl trimethoxysilane (PAPTMS) organosilanes,
and subsequent anchoring of Pd NPs onto its surface through the confinement
and coordination interactions. It is particularly worth mentioning
that PAPTMS can act as (i) a surface modifier for adjusting the wettability
of MS and (ii) a stabilizing and supporting agent for the uniform
and high dispersion of Pd NPs. In this study, a series of interfacial
active mesoporous catalysts are successfully prepared via simply altering
the PAPTMS mole fraction with respect to the TMOS silica source precursor.
Optical microscopy analysis indicates that the as-synthesized Pd/PAP-functionalized
mesoporous silica (MS-PAP)-20 catalyst can be used as an emulsifier
to create a stable water-in-oil (W/O) Pickering emulsion in ethyl
acetate/H2O two-phase systems, and the average diameter
of the droplet is around 175 ± 12 μm. Furthermore,
the catalytic results demonstrate that the catalyst is highly efficient
for the hydrogenation of various nitroarenes and its original catalytic
properties can be retained even after recycling six times.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Cetyltrimethylammonium
chloride (CTAC, 99%) was purchased from Nanjing Robiot Co., Ltd. Palladium(II)
acetate [Pd(OAc)2, ≥97%], TMOS (98%), and sodium
hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,
Ltd. PAPTMS and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%) were obtained
from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All other chemicals were of
analytical grade and were used without any further purification.

2.2 Preparation of MS-PAP
A representative
MS-PAP-20 sphere was synthesized according to our previous publication,
with some modifications.30 Typically, 3.52
g of CTAC and 2.5 mL of NaOH (1.0 mol/L) were added to a mixture of
500 mL of methanol and 400 mL of deionized water in a round-bottom
flask. After stirring at room temperature for 30 min, 2.64 g of TMOS
and 0.84 g of PAPTMS were added together to the solution dropwise
under stirring. The above solution was continuously stirred for 10
h and then left to settle overnight. The generated white product was
collected by vacuum filtration, thoroughly washed with deionized water
and ethanol, and dried at 80 °C for 18 h. To remove the pore-generating
template (CTAC), the as-synthesized sample was transferred into an
ethanol solution containing ammonium nitrate (0.5 g/150 mL) and stirred
for 1.0 h under reflux, and the extraction step was repeated two times
to ensure complete removal of CTAC. The template-removed MS-PAP-20
sphere was washed with deionized water and ethanol three times and
dried at 80 °C overnight under vacuum. MS spheres with different
surface wettabilities were obtained by adjusting the loading amount
of PAPTMS during the cocondensation process (the molar quantity of
PAPTMS was changed from 0 to 30 mol % with respect to TMOS), and the
samples were denoted as MS, MS-PAP-5, MS-PAP-10, MS-PAP-15, MS-PAP-20,
MS-PAP-25, and MS-PAP-30.

2.3 Loading of Pd NPs on MS-PAP
To a
stirred suspension of MS-PAP-20 (1.0 g) in 30 mL of toluene was added
65 mg of Pd(OAc)2. After stirring for 4 h [the amount of
Pd(OAc)2 adsorbed onto the solid materials was calculated
using UV–vis spectra], 20 mL of NaBH4 (120 mg) was
slowly added and stirred for another 4 h. The suspension was centrifuged
and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, resulting
in Pd/MS-PAP-20 (the loading amount of Pd was 3.02 wt %).

2.4 Pd/MS-PAP Catalyst for the Hydrogenation of
Nitroarenes
The liquid-phase hydrogenation of nitroarenes
was carried out in a 10 mL glass vessel. In a typical procedure, 30
mg of Pd/MS-PAP (0.8 mol %), 1.0 mmol of nitroarenes, 1.0 mL of toluene
or ethyl acetate, and 1.0 mL of deionized water were placed in the
vessel. After the replacement of air with H2 for three
times, the mixture was then stirred at 25 °C for a certain period
of time in an atmospheric hydrogen balloon. The reaction process was
monitored using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatographic analyzer.

2.5 Characterization
Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis was carried out using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20S-Twin
microscope at a 200 kV accelerating voltage. For sample preparation,
the powders were dispersed in an ethanol solution through sonication,
and then one drop of the suspension was dropped onto a microgrid.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using a Nicolet
iS5 spectrophotometer (frequency range from 4000 to 500 cm–1) with a KBr pellet. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed
on a Setaram Evolution 16/18 apparatus. The samples were heated in
an alumina pan from 30 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
under a high-purity nitrogen atmosphere. The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms were obtained on a Quantachrome autosorb iQ2 analyzer.
Before measurement, the samples were first degassed under vacuum at
393 K for 6 h at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The specific surface
areas of the samples were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller
(BET) method; pore size distribution and pore volume were calculated
using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were recorded on a Rigaku Ultima
IV diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation as the X-ray source
in the 2θ range of 10°–80°. The X-ray photoelectron
spectra (XPS) were recorded on the PHI-5702 instrument, and the C1s line at 284.5 eV was used as the binding-energy reference.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Material
Preparation and Characterization
Preparation of MS catalyst
with interfacial activity involves a
simple two-step route via the combination of cocondensation of different
organosilanes and the adsorption–reduction metal precursor
strategy. Specifically, TMOS and PAPTMS were chosen as the support
framework and surface-modifying agent, respectively, which were cohydrolysed
in an alkaline methanol–water solution in the presence of CTAC
(the pore-forming agent). Subsequently, the Pd NPs were embedded in
the mesoporous pore under the confinement and coordination interactions
after the removal of the CTAC template. The resulting samples were
denoted as Pd/MS-PAP-x (x is continuously
changed from 0 to 30 mol %), where x stands for the
molar fraction of PAPTMS with respect to TMOS. The surface wettability
of the MS-PAP-x support displayed the water CA as
it was gradually increased from 29.8° to 45.2°, 64.0°,
78.3°, 99.0°, 104.4°, and 117.1°, indicating the
continuous increase in the hydrophobic PAPTMS unit and decrease in
the hydrophilic TMOS silica source (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic
description of the fabrication of Pd/MS-PAP-x (x denotes the molar ratio of PAPTMS to TMOS) and
the corresponding contact angle (CA) test results.

The morphology and the microstructure of MS-PAP-20
and Pd/MS-PAP-20
samples were investigated using TEM. As can be seen from Figure 2a,b, the MS-PAP-20
microsphere possesses excellent dispersibility and the average diameter
is approximately 305 nm. Moreover, the surface of an individual microsphere
contains a plentiful of about 2.7 nm (as shown in Figure S1) perpendicularly oriented channels, which is advantageous
for the transference of metal precursors and substrate molecules.
In contrast, the shape and size of the Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalyst did not
show obvious change even after immobilization of the tiny Pd NPs.
The magnified TEM image of the Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalyst incontrovertibly
proves that a certain amount of Pd NPs with 2.0 nm are well-embedded
in the mesoporous channels via confinement effect and that others
are probably immobilized on the MS-PAP-20 support surface (Figure S2). However, the Pd NPs are mainly centered
at 2.5 ± 0.5 nm for the Pd/MS catalyst. A representative HAADF-STEM
image directly demonstrates a homogeneous distribution of Si, O, N,
and Pd elements on the Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalyst surface, and the Pd atoms
are completely surrounded by a large number of N atoms.

and (e,f) high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM)
and elemental mapping images of the Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalyst.

The successful incorporation of organic units is
further characterized
by using a FTIR spectrometer. Figure 3a exhibits the spectra of MS, Pd/MS, MS-PAP-20, and
Pd/MS-PAP-20. The broad absorption peaks at 3446 and 1084 cm–1 can be attributed to the surface-adsorbed water, −OH, and
Si–O–Si stretching vibrations.31,32 For MS-PAP-20 and Pd/MS-PAP-20 samples, the peaks at around 2933,
2858, and 1411 are ascribed to the C–H asymmetric, C–H
symmetric, and C–H bending vibrations of −CH2 groups, respectively, whereas the peak at 695 cm–1 is attributed to the C–H out-of-plane bending vibration of
the benzene ring in the PAPTMS units.33 The band at 1608 cm–1 can be assigned to the N–H
deformation vibration, confirming the presence of amine groups.34,35 The loading amount and the thermal stability of the phenylaminopropyl
(PAP) organic component are evaluated using TGA under a nitrogen atmosphere.
As shown in Figure 3b, the TGA curve of MS presents 15.4 wt % weight loss at around 150
°C because of the evaporation of physiadsorbed water. Comparatively,
the weight loss of MS-PAP-20 is dramatically decreased to 5.2 wt %
below 150 °C, suggesting a greater hydrophobic property. The
difference in weight loss between MS and MS-PAP-20 in the range of
150–700 °C indicates the loading amount of PAP component
up to 41.4 wt %. The result demonstrates that more than 95% of the
initial PAPTMS organosilane is incorporated into the MS microspheres.
The textural properties of these two catalysts are evaluated using
N2 adsorption–desorption analysis (Figure 3c). The isotherms of Pd/MS
and Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalysts are of type IV in the IUPAC classification,
which is characteristic of mesoporous materials. Their specific surface
area and pore volume are 715 m2·g–1, 0.599 cm3·g–1 and 244 m2·g–1, 0.264 cm3·g–1, respectively. The pore size distribution curves display the pore
size of MS contracted from 3.1 to 2.5 nm.

Figure 3 (a) FTIR spectra, (b)
TGA curves, (c) N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms, and (d) the corresponding pore size distribution of the
as-synthesized MS samples.

The XRD patterns of Pd/MS and Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalysts show
three
more diffraction peaks at around 39.8°, 46.4°, and 68.1°
except for the amorphous silica peak at 23.1°, which are characteristics
of the face-centered-cubic metallic Pd. Figure 4b displays the small-angle XRD patterns of
the as-prepared samples. It is clearly seen that the two materials
exhibit a broad reflection peak in the range of 2θ = 2°–3°,
indicating the existence of a mesoporous structure, which is well-consistent
with the results of the TEM and N2 adsorption–desorption
analyses. The XPS results show that Si, O, C, N, and Pd elements are
detected on the surface of the Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalyst. The Pd 3d spectrum
of the catalyst is shown in Figure 4d. The shoulder peaks centered at around 336.0 and
341.2 eV are ascribed to Pd0 3d3/2 and Pd0 3d5/2, whereas the peaks at 337.4 and 342.6 eV
are attributed to Pd2+ 3d3/2 and Pd2+ 3d5/2.36 The percentage of
Pd0 and Pd2+ species is calculated from the
relative areas of these four peaks, which show that approximately
63.2% of Pd2+ ions are reduced into Pd NPs through chemical
reduction with NaBH4. Moreover, it should be noted that
a certain amount of metal Pd NPs may be encapsulated into the MS channels
by the confinement effect.

To gain insights into the morphology of the droplets and
the size
of the Pd/MS-PAP-20-stabilized Pickering emulsion in various biphasic
systems, optical microscopy was used to observe the assembly behavior
of the interfacial active catalyst. From Figure 5a,d, it can be seen that the Pd/MS-PAP-20
catalyst is well-adsorbed on the ethyl acetate/H2O two-phase
interfaces, forming finely dispersed spherical emulsion droplets,
and the droplet size is mainly distributed in the range of 163–188
μm. In comparison, the droplets present obvious irregular shapes
in toluene/H2O and cyclohexane/H2O biphasic
systems, and the droplet size has a large range fluctuation (Figure 5b,c). In addition,
a considerable amount of catalyst particles are not involved in the
emulsion formation process. Thus, it can be speculated that the Pd/MS-PAP-20
catalyst will exhibit higher catalytic activity in ethyl acetate/H2O biphasic systems.

3.2 Performance Evaluation of the Interfacial
Active Catalyst in the Oil/Water Two-Phase Catalysis
Initially,
a series of Pd-based heterogeneous catalysts were investigated on
the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in the toluene/H2O biphasic
system. The catalytic results show that the conversion of nitrobenzene
is 55.1%, 72.5%, 75.6%, 88.3%, 96.9%, 87.9%, and 79.5% for Cat-0,
Cat-5, Cat-10, Cat-15, Cat-20, Cat-25, and Cat-30, respectively. Among
them, the Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalyst (Cat-20) exhibits the best catalytic
activity for nitrobenzene hydrogenation. To further investigate the
effect of solvent on the catalytic performance of the Pd/MS-PAP-20
catalyst, H2O, ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate/H2O, toluene/H2O, and cyclohexane/H2O were tested
in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene under identical reaction conditions.
As shown in Figure 6b, the conversion of nitrobenzene is only 26.1% in the aqueous solution
at 25 °C after 30 min of reaction, whereas the conversion of
nitrobenzene is significantly increased to 99.5% in ethyl acetate/H2O biphasic systems, which is similar to pure ethyl acetate.
It is also observed that the catalyst also affords high catalytic
activity in other oil/water biphasic systems (96.9% in toluene/H2O and 91.5% in cyclohexane/H2O) compared with the
H2O monophasic system. The enhancement of catalytic properties
of the Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalyst in the oil/water biphasic system is predominantly
attributed to the formation of countless microsized emulsion droplets,
resulting in a larger oil/water contact area and lower mass transfer
of the reaction partners as we previously reported.37,38

Figure 6 (a)
Influence of the loading amount of PAP organosilane on the
catalytic activity (the abbreviation Cat-0 to Cat-30 stands for Pd/MS
to Pd/MS-PAP-30 catalysts, respectively) and (b) influence of solvent
type on the catalytic performance of the Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalyst.

To explore the scope of the Pd/MS-PAP-20-catalyst-stabilized
Pickering
catalytic system for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes, a series of
nitroarenes with structurally divergent functional groups and replacement
positions are examined. The optimum reaction conditions for the hydrogenation
of nitroarenes are given in Table 1. It can be seen that both nitrobenzene conversion
and aniline selectivity are more than 99% in the presence of Pd/MS-PAP-20
catalyst within 30 min. When the reaction is carried out using 5 wt
% Pd/C as the catalyst, the conversion of nitrobenzene is very low
(63.2%) even after 60 min. The superior catalytic performance of the
Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalyst is probably because the formation of Pickering
emulsions can significantly enhance the interfacial area in oil/water
biphasic systems and decrease the mass transfer limitation of the
substrate. The shape and size of the Pd/MS-PAP-20-stabilized emulsion
are presented in Figure 5a,d. The catalyst can also quickly convert the nitroarenes with electron-donating
groups (Table 1, entries
3–11) and electron-withdrawing groups (Table 1, entries 12–15) into the corresponding
aniline derivatives, and the selectivity is above 99% within 60 min,
except for 4-chloronitrobenzene. It should be pointed out that the
hydrogenation of 4-chloronitrobenzene exists in the dechlorination
phenomenon and the byproduct is mainly aniline. Hence, Pd/MS-PAP-20
is a universal and efficient interfacial catalyst for the selective
hydrogenation of various nitroarenes in oil/water biphasic systems.

Using Pd/MS-PAP-20 as the Catalysta
a Reaction conditions: 30 mg of catalyst
(0.8 mol %), 1 mmol of substrate, 1.0 mL of ethyl acetate, 1.0 mL
of water, 25 °C, and atmospheric H2 balloon.

b Conversion and selectivity are determined
using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph.

c Hydrogenation with 20 mg of 5 wt
% Pd/C catalyst (0.8 mol %).

The stability and recyclability of the catalyst are a key factor
for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. After each reaction, the product
and the catalyst are, respectively, distributed into the ethyl acetate
and water phase through centrifugation. The upper oil phase is withdrawn
from the reaction system using a plastic straw, and fresh solvent
and reactant are added into the aqueous phase containing the catalyst
and reused in subsequent runs under identical reaction conditions.
As shown in Figure 7, the Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalyst shows significantly high catalytic activity
for the nitrobenzene hydrogenation, and the conversion remains >98%
during the first five recycles, except that the conversion of nitrobenzene
is reduced to 78.6% at the sixth run within 30 min. However, when
the reaction time is slightly increased to 60 min after the sixth
run, the nitrobenzene conversion reaches up to 96.2%. The content
of Pd in the filtration is measured through inductively coupled plasma-optical
emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), which reveals that the leaching of
Pd NPs from the support surface can be negligible. The recyclability
result further demonstrates that the Pd NPs are well-encapsulated
in the mesoporous channels and immobilized by the abundant amine groups.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed a facile strategy to
synthesize interfacial active MS catalysts by one-pot cohydrolysis
of PAPTMS and TMOS organosilanes. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity
of the MS surface can be conveniently adjusted by altering the molar
content of PAPTMS relative to the TMOS silica source precursor. Optical
microscopy reveals that the Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalyst can be used as an
emulsifier to create a stable water-in-oil-type Pickering emulsion
in ethyl acetate/H2O two-phase systems. Moreover, the prepared
Pd/MS-PAP-20 catalyst-stabilized Pickering emulsion can efficiently
reduce nitroarenes to target products in oil/water biphasic systems
because of the countless microsized reactors and decreased mass-transport
limitation. Therefore, our prepared interfacial active MS catalyst
simplifies the separation and recovery of products and the catalyst,
meanwhile providing new possibilities for various organic transformation
reactions in biphasic systems. Further research relative to the present
work is going on.
