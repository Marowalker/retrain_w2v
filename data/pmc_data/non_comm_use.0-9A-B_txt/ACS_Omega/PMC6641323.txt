In recent years,
researchers have made significant progress in
the development of inorganic nanofibers (including nanowires). Typically,
inorganic nanofibers are synthesized via crystal growth in solution;
however, a limited number of studies have focused on their preparation
directly from solid raw materials (with no examples of synthesis conducted
at room temperature and atmospheric pressure). In this work, we successfully
synthesized nanofibers of calcium sulfate hemihydrate (bassanite,
CaSO4·0.5H2O) at 20 °C and 1 atm by
mixing calcite and dilute sulfuric acid in methanol. The bassanite
nanofibers are concluded to be synthesized by the formation of calcium
sulfate on the calcite surface and its simultaneous reaction with
the generated H2O. Because bassanite exhibits useful physical
properties that include high mechanical strength, high thermal stability,
and excellent chemical stability, its nanofibers can be widely applied
to rubber, plastics, antifriction materials, and paper as a strengthening
agent, for heat-resistance, or as a flame retardant, or for creep
resistance.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Because of the various useful physical properties of inorganic
nanofibers, researchers have actively explored new synthesis methods
for these materials in recent years. Generally, inorganic nanofibers
(including nanowires) are synthesized by growing crystals in solution.
For example, nanofibers are fabricated using hydrothermal methods
(for ZnS1 and CdS2), electrospinning (for TiO23), and photochemical etching (for GaN4). However, only TiO2 nanofibers have been produced from
solid starting materials by a hydrothermal method.5 In our study, bassanite (calcium sulfate hemihydrate; CaSO4·0.5H2O) nanofibers have been successfully
synthesized in one step at 20 °C and 1 atm using solid calcite
(CaCO3) as a starting material and mixing it with dilute
sulfuric acid in methanol.

Bassanite potentially can be used
in a wide range of applications
due to its high mechanical strength, good thermal stability, and high
chemical stability.7−9 For example, it can be added to rubber, plastics,
antifriction materials, and paper as a strengthening agent, for heat-resistance,
as a flame retardant, or for creep resistance.10−13 Gypsum has similar chemical and
thermal properties as bassanite, but the synthesis of gypsum nanofibers
has not been reported so far, and it is difficult to obtain gypsum
in organic solvents. For these reasons, several studies have investigated
the synthesis of bassanite whiskers.14−20 However, these whiskers cannot be considered nanofibers because
of their large diameters and small aspect ratios. In addition, they
were synthesized via crystal growth in solution. However, recent experiments
indicate that bassanite whiskers can be easily obtained by mixing
Ca2+ ions and sulfuric acid in organic solvents.21−23 Normally, gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) is synthesized
by the reaction of Ca2+ with SO42– in water, but bassanite is obtained by adding an organic solvent
to a supersaturated aqueous solution of calcium sulfate, which quenches
the gypsum formation reaction and produces a metastable aqueous bassanite
phase.21 In this work, bassanite nanofibers
have been successfully synthesized through the reaction of calcite
and dilute sulfuric acid in methanol by combining Ca2+,
SO42–, and H2O species on
the calcite crystal surface.

2 Results and Discussion
Both methanol and dilute sulfuric acid were added to calcite, and
after stirring for 5 min at 20 °C and 1 atm, the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) observation revealed that the trigonal calcite crystals
in Figure 1a were transformed
into rods (sample M-5; Figure 1b). After 95 min, these rods were further transformed into
the nanofibers with diameters ranging from 20 to 50 nm (sample M-95; Figure 1c), and only nanofibers
with sizes ranging from 20 to 50 nm were observed in the sample after
425 min (sample M-425; Figure 1d). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the transformation
of calcite to bassanite with increasing reaction time. In addition
to the XRD peaks of calcite (Figure 2a), M-5 showed small peaks corresponding to a bassanite
phase (Figure 2b),
which suggested that the rods observed in Figure 1b also contained some bassanite phase. The
XRD peaks of the bassanite phase increased with the reaction time.
Sample M-95 (Figure 2c) showed a predominance of the bassanite peaks, and M-425 (Figure 2d) mostly consisted
of the bassanite peaks, whereas only a small calcite peak was detected
at 29.4° in addition to the peaks of a standard bassanite sample
shown in Figure 2e.
The above SEM and XRD results revealed that the trigonal calcite crystals
directly transformed to the bassanite nanofibers.

M-425: Only the nanofibers are observed, and the trigonal crystals
are not recognized at 425 min. The presence of curved fibers indicates
that the produced bassanite nanofibers are relatively flexible.

and those of calcite weaker at 95 min. A small unknown peak is observed
at 11.3°. (d) Sample M-425: At 425 min, only the peaks of bassanite
are observed except for the shoulder peak at 29.4°. (e) Bassanite
standard sample.

From the results of thermogravimetry/differential
thermal analysis
(TG/DTA) obtained for the M-425 sample (see Figure S1), bassanite content was estimated at about 93 mass %. Hence,
mixing calcite with dilute sulfuric acid in methanol with the subsequent
stirring at 20 °C and 1 atm can produce high-purity bassanite
nanofibers. In addition, the structural analysis of the M-425 sample
was conducted using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope.
The d-spacing values obtained from the high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images (Figure 3a) and their fast Fourier transform
(FFT) analysis (Figure 3b) revealed that the synthesized nanofibers grew along the c axis direction. This result is in agreement with previous
studies of bassanite nanorods6 and whiskers,19 in which elongation along the c axis was also observed.

a bassanite nanofiber
along its c axis. (a) A HR-TEM microphotograph and
(b) an FFT pattern corresponding to the reciprocal bassanite two-dimensional
lattice structure along the c axis. The samples for
the TEM observations were prepared by dispersing the M-425 powder
on a carbon–copper grid without using solvents.

To evaluate the effect of stirring on bassanite
nanofiber synthesis,
we also prepared nanofibers using the same procedure but without stirring.
When the mixture of calcite, methanol, and dilute sulfuric acid was
stored at room temperature under normal pressure, similar nanofibers
were produced. The SEM image of the product obtained at a reaction
time of 5 min (M′-5) is shown in Figure 4a, which confirms the presence of fibers
with diameters of 30–100 nm on the surface of the calcite crystal.
The sample obtained after 95 min (M′-95) predominantly consisted
of the nanofibers that were formed directly from the calcite crystals
(see the SEM images depicted in Figure 4b,c). The content of the nanofibers increased with
increasing reaction time, and the sample obtained after 425 min (M′-425)
was almost exclusively composed of nanofibers (Figure 4d).

Figure 4 Products in methanol without stirring (a–d),
and a product
in water without stirring (e). (a) Sample M′-5: Small fibers
formed on the surface of the trigonal calcite crystals at a reaction
time of 5 min. (b, c) Sample M′-95: At 95 min, many nanofibers
are formed (b), and the nanofibers are directly formed from the trigonal
crystals (c). (d) Sample M′-425: Only the nanofibers are recognized
at 425 min. (e) Sample W-425: When water was used as a solvent, the
trigonal calcite crystals transformed to rod-shaped crystals at 425
min.

The XRD pattern of M′-5
(see Figure S2a) contained strong calcite peaks and weak bassanite peaks,
and M′-95 contained more calcite peaks than bassanite ones
(Figure S2b), whereas the XRD pattern of
M′-425 (Figure S2c) was almost identical
to that of M′-95. The results indicate that mixing calcite
with dilute sulfuric acid in methanol and storing the resulting mixture
at 20 °C and 1 atm without stirring generates nanofibers consisting
of both the bassanite and calcite phases. As indicated by the TG/DTA
curves (shown in Figure S3), the estimated
bassanite content in M′-425 was about 64 mass %.

Nevertheless,
when calcite was added to an “aqueous”
solution of sulfuric acid and stored for 425 min, it produced only
the gypsum phase without bassanite (W-425; see Figure S2d). The SEM image of W-425 (Figure 4e) displays the formation of rod-shaped crystals
with dimensions of about 1 μm × 30 μm. The reason
for the formation of gypsum when water is used as a solvent is the
instantaneous reaction between the calcite and H+ species
of the sulfuric acid, which leads to the interaction between Ca2+ and SO42– ions and crystallization
of the obtained product after the dissolution of calcite.24

In the reaction of calcite and sulfuric
acid in methanol, we also
conducted experiments at a sulfuric acid concentration of 10 M (0.05
mL) instead of 1 M (0.5 mL). After 425 min of reaction, nanofibers
containing bassanite were produced (Figure S4). When 0.5 mL of 1 M sulfuric acid was added to 50 mL of methanol,
the content of H2O in the solvent is 1.23 mass %, and the
value for the case of 10 M is 0.07 mass %. The effect of H2O content in a methanol/water system on the formation of bassanite
is investigated by Tritschler et al.,25 where CaCl2 and sulfuric acid react in methanol/water
while changing the methanol/water ratio to systematically produce
calcium sulfate anhydrite, bassanite, and gypsum. They show that bassanite
forms between 0.2 and 33 mass % H2O, bassanite content
in the product is almost 0 at 0.2 mass % H2O, it increases
with increasing H2O content to reach 100% at about 2 mass
% H2O. The change in the products with changing methanol/water
ratio may be caused by the change in the dielectric constant of the
solvent; with decreasing H2O content, the dielectric constant
of the solvent decreases and less hydrated species may form.21,25 These observations indicate that, in our experiments in methanol,
H2O of the bassanite nanofibers is not derived from H2O in the sulfuric acid because at least in the case with 10
M sulfuric acid, the content of H2O in the solvent (0.07
mass %) is far below the range for bassanite formation (0.2–33
mass %). Therefore, the observed formation of bassanite nanofibers
in a methanol solvent can be described as follows. Initially, the
reaction between calcite and H+ species occurs on the surface
of calcite crystals to produce Ca2+, H2O, and
CO2; the content of H2O on the surface of the
calcite crystals becomes higher than that of the bulk phase; then
on the surface of the calcite crystals, the produced Ca2+ and H2O react with SO42– to form bassanite nanofibers.

This study showed that stirring
of the calcite in the methanol
solvent affected the results. Without stirring, we believe that the
H2CO3 and CO2 species produced during
the neutralization reaction remain on the calcite crystal surface,
which decreases the reactivity of its inner part with H+ and suppresses subsequent bassanite formation. In contrast, stirring
moves H2CO3 and CO2 molecules into
the bulk solution, thus promoting the neutralization of calcite and
the formation of bassanite. In reality, the amount of the released
CO2 measured inside a sealed reaction vessel was very small
before stirring and significantly increased after stirring (see Figure S5). Because stirring significantly affects
the bassanite content in the final product, it is likely that these
synthesis conditions can be optimized to obtain high-purity bassanite
nanofibers.

3 Conclusions
In this study, high-purity
bassanite nanofibers were synthesized
in one step at 20 °C and 1 atm using inexpensive calcite as a
raw material. The bassanite content in the sample with a stirring
condition in methanol at a reaction time of 425 min was about 93 mass
%. In addition to its use as a strengthening agent for rubber, plastics,
antifriction materials, and paper, it can be also fabricated in a
transparent form due to its fine fiber diameter of 20–50 nm.
Hence, the produced bassanite nanofibers potentially can be utilized
in more specialized applications, such as glass-strengthening products.
Further, because nanofibers and whiskers in previous works were obtained
in aqueous solutions, incorporating them into a piece of rubber or
plastic in a disperse form was difficult. In contrast, the bassanite
nanofibers in this study were synthesized in methanol, which can be
more easily dispersed in rubber or/and plastic to create promising
new materials.

4 Methods
4.1 Synthesis
of Bassanite Nanofibers
A weight of 50 mg of calcium carbonate
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries,
Ltd.) and 50 mL of methanol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.)
was added to a 130 mL Pyrex glass container, which was subsequently
sealed and purged with nitrogen to remove any traces of reactive gases.
After that, 500 μL of 1 M sulfuric acid was added to the container
using a micropipette, and the resulting mixture was stirred using
a magnetic stirring bar on a stir plate. The reaction was allowed
to proceed for 425 min at a temperature of 20 °C. For comparison,
the same experiment was conducted using distilled water as the solvent.
The samples synthesized in methanol were filtered and washed with
methanol, and the samples synthesized in distilled water were filtered
and washed with distilled water.

4.2 Sample
Characterization
The calcite,
bassanite (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), and produced samples
were subjected to XRD mineralogical analysis with Cu Kα radiation
(Rigaku; Ultima IV), whereas their morphologies were investigated
using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-6335F). Crystal structure
analysis was performed using a transmission electron microscope (FEI
Titan 80-300). Additionally, to evaluate the thermal characteristics
of the obtained bassanite nanofibers, their TG/DTA analysis (Rigaku;
Thermo Plus Evo TG8120) was performed from room temperature to 900
°C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in an air flow of 100
cm3/min.
