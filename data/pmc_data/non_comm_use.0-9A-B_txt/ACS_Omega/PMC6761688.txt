The
excitation-dependent photoluminescence quantum yield (PL-QY)
of strong n-type nitrogen–boron codoped 6H fluorescent silicon
carbide (f-SiC) at room temperature is experimentally determined for
the first time. The PL-QY measurements are realized by an integrating
sphere system based on a classical two-measurement approach. In particular,
in accordance to the difference between our in-lab setup and the standard
setup of the two-measurement approach, we have technically modified
the experimental design, the data processing algorithm, and the estimation
of relative uncertainty. The measured highest PL-QY of f-SiC samples is found to reach above 30%.
We compare the PL-QYs at a certain excitation power of all f-SiC samples
by considering their intrinsic defect densities. Finally, the evolution
of the excitation power-dependent PL-QY of f-SiC is attributed to
both band-to-band and impurity-assisted Auger recombination.

1 Introduction
White light-emitting diode
(LED) light sources have been massively
implemented in almost every aspect of industries and daily lives.
Compared to traditional white light solutions, e.g., incandescent
light bulbs, white LED light sources have several advantages. For
instance, white LED light sources are more energy efficient, contain
no mercury or other hazardous elements, and require no warm-up period.
There are three configurations of white LED light sources. The first
is the so-called tricolor configuration that consists of a red, a
green, and a blue LED; however, the color mixing corresponding to
this design is not very smooth. The second is the most commercialized
type that is made of a blue LED covered by yellow phosphors. As blue
LEDs and yellow phosphors are very efficient, this type of white LED
can induce high luminescent efficiency. However, as the typical yellow
phosphor is made of cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet, i.e., (YAG):Ce,1 its degradation issue would cause the white LED
light source to have a low color rendering index (CRI). Moreover,
the cost and supply issues regarding the rare earth elements in yellow
phosphors, e.g., Ce in (YAG):Ce, should be also concerned. The last
configuration is composed of a near-ultraviolet (NUV) LED covered
by red/green/blue phosphors. Note that this type of white LED light
source can induce high CRI, but the efficiency of the red phosphor
is quite low. Fortunately, a new type of inorganic phosphor grown
by Kamiyama et al.,2 i.e., the donor and
acceptor codoped fluorescent silicon carbide (f-SiC), which contains
no rare earth elements and has no degradation issues, is anticipated
to realize NUV excitation-based white light emission that could reach
out an optimized tradeoff between the luminous efficacy and CRI. By
getting heavily nitrogen–boron (N–B) codoped, f-SiC
can be applied as a passive wavelength conversion medium, where strong
orange-yellowish light emission with large full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) can be generated by optically pumping f-SiC via a NUV light
source, e.g., a nitride-based NUV LED chip. It is also worth noting
that SiC is regarded as a better platform for the integration of a
nitride-based NUV LED chip compared to the prevalent sapphire substrate.
In addition, another type of f-SiC that is nitrogen–aluminum
(N–Al) codoped is anticipated to emit blue-green light by NUV
light source pumping.3 It has been proposed4,5 that a new type of white LED light source with high CRI can be achieved
by growing the stacking structure that contains a nitride-based NUV
LED chip, a N–B as well as a N–Al codoped f-SiC layer
as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the stacking structure of a white LED based
on N–B and N–Al codoped f-SiC thin films.

Since N–Al codoped SiC does not show photoluminescence
(PL)
at room temperature (RT), in the scope of this research, f-SiC usually
refers to N–B codoped SiC. Two methods have been proposed to
enhance the intensities of the donor–acceptor pair (DAP) recombination
events in f-SiC, i.e., increase the density of DAP and the sample
thickness. Luckily, the above-mentioned two methods have been successfully
implemented in the epilayer growth of f-SiC, thanks to the advent
of fast sublimation growth process (FSGP) method developed by Syväjärvi
et al.,6 which makes the current f-SiC
have N–B codoping beyond 1018 cm–3. In addition, with the FSGP method, it is also easy to achieve sufficient
epilayer thickness since the growth rate of FSGP can be up to 200
μm·h–1.77 Furthermore, the densities of the 1-D (i.e.,
micropipe), two-dimensional (i.e., stacking fault), and three-dimensional8 (i.e., polytype switch, carbon inclusion, and
silicon droplet) defects in f-SiC have been drastically decreased
to the negligible levels6,9 by applying the FSGP
method for the growth of f-SiC epilayers. Meanwhile, the source SiC
material for FSGP is prepared via the modified physical vapor transport
technique developed by Wellmann et al.,8,10,11 where the stable nitrogen doping and low dislocation
densities in the source SiC material have been realized.

As
knowing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PL-QY) of f-SiC,
i.e., the ratio of the emitted photons to the absorbed photons of
the f-SiC thin film, is of great importance for the evaluation of
the upper limit of the external quantum efficiency of the entire white
LED device shown in Figure 1. In this research, we demonstrate the experimental methodology
regarding the determination of the PL-QY on n-type f-SiC samples.
Note that only n-type f-SiC shows strong emission at RT where the
reason regarding the distinctive luminescent behaviors of n- and p-type
f-SiCs has been investigated before.12 In
addition, we also give the explanation for the physical mechanism
corresponding to the incident power-dependent PL-QY of f-SiC.

There are two categories for the PL-QY measurement on a fluorescent
material, i.e., the relative and absolute techniques.13 For the relative technique, a standard f-SiC sample is
needed whose PL-QY is already known. It is required that the standard
f-SiC should have similar excitation, absorption, and emission properties
to those of the sample to be measured. Since it is difficult to fully
duplicate the experimental conditions in which the reference spectra
of the standard f-SiC are measured in our lab, in this research, we
adopt the absolute techniques for the PL-QY measurements. As f-SiC
is a solid thin-film sample with high refractive index, the issues
of anisotropic light emission and wave-guiding effects14 could greatly affect the accuracy of the results
of PL-QY measurement. A direct solution might be mapping the light
emission to the solid angle distribution where the ratio of the detected
PL emission to the whole PL emission can be determined by referring
the experimental conditions related to PL excitation/detection. However,
this solution is quite cumbersome and not so viable where heavy workload
is required and the interval of the solid angle needs to be carefully
chosen. On the other hand, integrating sphere has been recognized
as the standard equipment for measuring the PL-QY of solid thin films.15,16 By implementing integrating sphere into PL-QY measurements, all
of the reflected and emitted light can be collected where the concern
regarding the angular dependence of the PL emission is no longer needed.
Therefore, the integrating sphere-based measurement system has been
widely applied in the determination of PL-QY of solid thin films.14,16−19 There are two types of methodologies based on the integrating sphere
system for absolute determination of PL-QY,20 i.e., three-measurement14,17,21 and two-measurement18,22,23 approaches. In fact, the two-measurement approach proposed by Johnson
et al.18 was derived from the three-measurement
one developed by de Mello et al.14 Afterward,
Leyre et al.20 have theoretically proved
that the values of the PL-QY determined by these two approaches are
identical. In this research, by applying an integrating sphere system,
we developed the experimental procedure regarding the determination
of f-SiC’s PL-QY derived from the classical two-measurement
approach. The reason behind the differences in the PL-QY of all f-SiC
samples under the same excitation power was investigated. Additionally,
we also tried to elaborate the trend of PL-QY against the changed
excitation power regarding the certain f-SiC sample as well.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 PL-QY of Strong n-Type
f-SiC
In this
research, three N–B codoped strong n-type f-SiC samples, i.e.,
F-1/2/3, were employed in PL-QY measurements, where the basic parameters
for these three f-SiC samples are summarized in Table 1. By applying the FSGP method,6 the epilayers of the f-SiC samples were grown
on the (0001) plane of the commercial 6H-SiC substrates (SiCrystal
GmbH) with low off-axis (orientation ⟨112̅0⟩ ±
1.4°) at 1725 °C. Note that sample F-1 and samples F-2/3
were grown in two separate batches.

For the
experimental design, data processing algorithm, and the
estimation of uncertainty regarding the PL-QY determination of f-SiC
samples, refer to Section 4.1. The PL-QYs of each sample were excited under seven different
incident beam powers, i.e., 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 14 mW, to study
the power dependency of f-SiC’s PL-QY. Note that the PL-QYs
for all three samples were measured twice with the incident beam power
from 0.25 to 8 mW, where the measurements corresponding to the beam
incidence of 14 mW were only launched for once due to the unstable
fiber-coupled maximum output power of the laser source. The uncertainties
of the measured PL-QYs for each sample with specific incident power
have been estimated using eq 11, where all of the UPL values
together with the respective mean values of ηPL are
presented in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Averaged PL-QYs of samples F-1/2/3. The error bars indicate the
relative uncertainties (UPL) of the PL-QY
measurements that were calculated using eq 11.

From Figure 2, it
is clearly seen that the PL-QYs of F-1 under all incident powers are
lower than those of F-2/3. On the other hand, we also measured the
time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of these three samples, where
different numbers of spots were characterized on different samples
(F-1, nine; F-2/3, three). The TRPL measurement results are summarized
in Figure 3, and the
related experimental details are given in Section 4.2. Compared to F-1, F-2/3 have slower PL
decay at the initial stage. This indicates that the lifetimes, τ,
corresponding to the decay channels of E1/E2 centers, which have been confirmed24 as the dominating intrinsic defects in 6H f-SiC,
in F-2/3 are longer. Assuming that these three samples have the identical
hole capture cross sections (σh) corresponding to
the E1/E2 centers,
the densities of E1/E2 centers can be estimated by N = (σh⟨νth,h⟩τ)−1, where ⟨νth,h⟩ refers to the mean
thermal velocity of nonequilibrium holes. Hence, it is clear to see
that the densities of E1/E2 centers are higher in sample F-1 compared to those of
F-2/3, which is considered as the one of the major causes regarding
the gap in PL-QYs of F-1 and F-2/3.

Figure 3 Normalized TRPL decays recorded via time-correlated
single-photon
counting (TCSPC) histograms for samples F-1/2/3. Each error bar indicates
the standard deviation normalized by the corresponding photon count
at a certain time point.

In addition, regarding
the NUV beam excitation on the front sides
of the three samples, by considering the effective penetration depth, Zeff, as the depth where the intensity of the
incident beam has just decreased to the midpoint between the original
intensity and the attenuated intensity at the bottom of the thin film,
one can build up the relation [I0 + I0 exp(−αd)]/2 = I0 exp(−αZeff); then, we have the expression of Zeff as shown in eq 1. Note that d refers to the sample
thickness that should be equal to the sum of depi and dsub; in our case, the
absorption coefficient, α, is about 400 cm–1 at 375 nm25 with E ⊥ c configuration and I0 is the
incident NUV beam intensity. 1  Interestingly,
by applying eq 1 for
these three samples, it was
found that they share almost the identical value of Zeff, which is around 17.33 μm, due to their very
large values of d. As a result, it is believed that26 samples F-1/2/3 have an identical injection
level g (cm–3·s–1) since their effective penetration depths are equal. Hence, with
the same amount of injected photons for the three samples, one half
of the photons actually get absorbed within the depth of 0 to Zeff. Meanwhile, it is considered that almost
all of the other half of photons are absorbed within the depth of Zeff of 45 μm, which means the proportions
of the photons being absorbed by the substrates for all three samples
can be negligible. Hence, it is believed that with the identical effective
penetration depth, Zeff, as well as sufficient
epilayer thickness, depi, for all three
samples, the differences regarding their PL-QYs are not correlated
to their different sample thicknesses. In addition, the reason why
sample F-2 has slightly higher PL-QY compared to that of F-3 is still
not clear. By considering the emission of each f-SiC sample, which
is mainly contributed by the upper part of the respective epilayer,
i.e., from the epilayer surface to Zeff, as a point source, the proportion of the emission from the edges
of each f-SiC sample is proportional to its sample thickness, d.27 Therefore, the PL-QY of
F-3 might be more underestimated due to its lesser sample thickness
compared to that of F-2, which causes the measured PL-QY of F-3 to
be lower than that of F-2. Another reason can be derived from the
doping conditions of F-2/3. Regarding the summarized Nd/Na in Table 1, we can see that only the Nd/Na for F-2 is higher than
2 compared to that for F-1/3, where the higher proportion of n-type
dopant in F-2 might further compensate the nonradiative behavior regarding
the shallow N-induced donors.28

2.2 Auger Recombination in f-SiC
In addition,
an obvious tendency can be observed from Figure 2 that the PL-QY of the n-type 6H f-SiC sample
increases with the decrease in incident power. We believe that this
phenomenon is caused by the enhanced Auger recombination in the f-SiC
sample when the incident power density on the sample is increased.29 In particular, it has been observed that30 a fast decay component emerges during free carrier
absorption (FCA) measurement on SiC at elevated injection levels,
where this fast decay channel is attributed to band-to-band Auger
recombination. Moreover, it is well known that the rate of Auger recombination
is proportional to the cube31 of the total
carrier densities, i.e., n0 + Δn, where Δn refers to the density
of nonequilibrium carriers. As the focused incident beam spot on the
sample port of the integrating sphere has the diameter of 3 mm, the
calculated injection level on f-SiC samples corresponding to the range
of the incident beam power, i.e., 250 μW to 14 mW, is from 1.33
× 1018 to 7.47 × 1019 cm–3·s–1. Therefore the change of the Auger recombination
rate is expected to be more than 1 order of magnitude in the PL-QY
measurements. On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that the phononless
e––e––h+ related Auger recombination becomes prominent for strong n-type
SiC,32 where the shallow donors could be
involved in an impurity-assisted Auger process. This could also be
one of the major causes regarding why the PL-QY of F-1 is far lower
as its Nd is much higher compared to that
of F-2/3. Future work about the characterization of the carrier lifetimes
in f-SiC at high injection levels by the experimental technique like
time-resolved FCA33−35 is needed to study how the PL-QY is degraded by Auger
recombination and its carrier dynamics.

3 Conclusions
In this research, we have designed the experimental scheme related
to the absolute PL-QY determination on f-SiC samples, where the measurement
methodology was based on a modified two-measurement approach using
an integrating sphere. The algorithm corresponding to the data processing
and the uncertainty estimation of PL-QY experimental results were
also developed. This newly developed PL-QY determination procedure
is suitable for measuring the PL-QY of the thin-film sample with very
weak emission (compared to the intensity of the excitation beam),
e.g., indirect band gap thin films. The excitation power-dependent
PL-QY of the three n-type 6H f-SiC samples, i.e., F-1/2/3, have been
measured. By combining the PL-QY and TRPL measurement results for
these three f-SiC samples, it was revealed that the PL-QY of f-SiC
can be influenced by its densities of E1/E2 centers, which are the major nonradiative
centers in f-SiC. A clear tendency where the PL-QY of f-SiC sample
increases with the decreasing incident power indicates strong Auger
recombination in f-SiC at high injection levels. It is believed that
the Auger recombination in strong n-type f-SiC can be enhanced by
the increased density of either injected carriers or the n-type dopant,
where the latter could induce impurity-assisted phononless e––e––h+ type of Auger recombination
related to shallow donors.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 PL-QY Determination
For the determination
of PL-QY of f-SiC samples, an integrating sphere (OL 700-71, Gooch
& Housego) with a diameter of 6 in., a continuous diode NUV laser
with λ = 375 nm (LBX-375 HPE), and an optical spectrometer (CAS
140B, Instrument Systems GmbH) were employed. Note that the integrating
sphere applied in this measurement has only one sample port on the
edge of the integrating sphere. This makes the measurement condition
different from that of the classical two-measurement approach where
the sample is placed at the center of the integrating sphere.20 Therefore, the classical two-measurement approach
has to be modified to match our measurement condition. In addition,
the related algorithm of experimental data processing and the evaluation
of relative uncertainty regarding the estimation of PL-QY have to
be redeveloped as well. The important symbols and corresponding descriptions
applied in this experiment are summarized in Table 2.

4.1.1 Measurement System Design
As a
matter of fact, for the classical two-measurement approach,20 the PL emission from a fluorescent sample collected
by an integrating sphere, where the sample is placed at the center
of the sphere, can be divided into four aspects depending on the conditions
related to excitation and detection. The PL emission is considered
to be collected under four conditions, i.e., front excitation–front
detection (FEFD), front excitation–back detection (FEBD), back
excitation–front detection (BEFD), and back excitation–back
detection (BEBD), as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Four configurations related to the PL emission from a
f-SiC sample
(i.e., f-SiC epilayer + 6H-SiC substrate). As for the subscripts of
the names of PL signals, “F”, “B”, “E”,
and “D” represent front, back, excitation, and detection,
respectively, where the front side of the f-SiC sample refers to the
side of epilayer.

Note that during the
PL-QY determination on f-SiC samples, it was
found that the luminescence intensities regarding the two configurations
with back excitation, i.e., PLBEBD and PLBEFD, are almost undetectable. This is because that the excitation beam
has been largely attenuated when it reaches to the interface between
the f-SiC epilayer and the 6H-SiC substrate from backside. In addition,
as the emission from the edges of each f-SiC sample is originated
from the leaky modes36 corresponding to
the planar waveguide cavity, where the leaky modes are evanescent
in the air, the detected intensities regarding this type of emission
can be treated as negligible. To sum up, there are altogether four
types of luminescence spectra required, i.e., the spectra of the original
and attenuated excitation beams without/with the sample presented
inside the integrating sphere (their integrated luminescent intensities
are denoted La and Lc, respectively), and PLFEFD/PLFEBD (the
total integrated PL intensity from the sample is denoted Pc), to extract sample’s PL-QY. Note that the aforementioned
notations, i.e., La | Lb | Lc are adopted from de
Mello et al.14Figure 5 shows the experimental design based on the
6 in. diameter integrating sphere OL 700-71 for the PL-QY determination
on f-SiC samples in this research. It is worth mentioning that the
incident beam power was calibrated by measuring it at the sample port
with a power meter (energy meter PM100D with a silicon detector S130VC,
Thorlabs, Inc.) before steps 1 and 4 to ensure the same incident power
for the reflectance/transmittance fiber optic probe (FOP). The spectra
recorded through the four steps of the PL-QY measurement are summarized
in Table 3 with specifications.
Taking the measurement results of sample F-1 with the incident power
of 5 mW based on the experimental setup shown in Figure 5 as an example, the measured
spectra defined in Table 3 are shown in Figure 6.

are presented in (a), whereas the spectrum recorded in step 4 is presented

4.1.2 Data
Processing Algorithm
In step
1, a certified Reflectance Standard (Refl-Std), which is made of pressed
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) powder packed in a 2 in. diameter holder,
was installed on the sample port for measuring the original spectra
of the excitation beam, where the Refl-Std was used for preventing
light leakage through the sample port. ISRC,W and ISRC,N are the two spectra related
to the original source beam measured in different wavelength ranges,
i.e., the wide mode (350–784 nm) and the narrow mode (390–784
nm), respectively. Normally, an optical density filter (OD filter)
was used when measuring ISRC,W to prevent
the absolute intensity of its main peak centered at 375 nm from exceeding
the upper detection limit of the optical spectrometer. Here, we got
the expression of the integrated intensity of the original excitation
spectrum (La) shown in eq 2, where Refl-Std(λ) refers
to the reflectance spectrum of the Refl-Std. 2  In panel (a) of Figure 6, the spectrum of IFEFD,W,dir, which includes the spectrum of PLFEFD, was also measured with the OD filter. From the normalized spectrum
of IFEFD,W,dir shown in inset (a-ii) of Figure 6, we can see that
by adding the OD filter the line shape of IFEFD,W,dir is affected by ambient noise due to its weak intensity. In addition,
the spectrum presented in panel (b) of Figure 6, i.e., IFEBD, which reflects the information of the line shapes related to PLFEBD, was measured without the OD filter. It can be expected
that if the OD filter was added during the measurements of IFEBD, the related spectrum would be also affected
by the ambient noise. As a consequence, we decided to measure the
spectra that were used for extracting the PL emission spectra without
adding the OD filter. To establish the correlation between the spectra
measured with/without the OD filter, a scaling ratio (SCR) expressed
by eq 3 is needed. Note
that the values of both components in eq 3 should be similar since the degree of attenuation
resulted by the OD filter is a constant. Accordingly, the extracted
PL spectra related to the FEFD/FEBD configuration have to be scaled
down by a factor of SCR to calculate PL-QY. The modified expression
for PL-QY is shown in eq 4 where the value of PL-QY is denoted by ηPL and Pc,FEBD/Pc,FEFD refers
to the integrated PL intensity of PLFEFD(λ)/PLFEBD(λ), respectively. 3   4  From
the inset (a-ii) of Figure 6, we can see that the line
shapes of the spectra of the excitation beam measured with/without
the OD filter (i.e., ISRC,W/ISRC,N, respectively) are identical and so are the two
spectra of the PL emission with FEFD configuration (IFEFD,W,dir and IFEFD,N,dir). It is confirmed that spectra are scaled down by the OD filter
regardless of the wavelength; hence, it is reasonable to apply SCR
for PL-QY calculation. The upper limit of the detectable wavelength
(i.e., 784 nm), which is also shown in eqs 3 and 4, is actually
caused by the limitation of the optical spectrometer. It is believed
that the PL intensity of the f-SiC samples with wavelength shorter
than the lower limits of the integrals in eq 4 (i.e., 450 nm) can be negligible. In the
inset (a-i) of Figure 6, it is clearly seen that the spectrum of the excitation beam has
a tail part that consists of two sharp peaks at ∼406.4 and
∼757.4 nm and two broad peaks at ∼440 and ∼470
nm. This tail part is still distinguishable in the spectrum of IFEFD,N,dir corresponding to the PL emission
excited by the FEFD configuration. Hence, it is essential to split
PLFEFD(λ) from IFEFD,N,dir. Later, we will show that PLFEFD(λ) can be recovered
by PLFEBD(λ). Since PLFEFD(λ) and
PLFEBD(λ) are induced under the same excitation condition
with the source beam incidence at the air/f-SiC epilayer interface,
the line shapes of these two spectra should be identical. In step
2, the sample holder, which is used for fixing the f-SiC sample, was
installed on the sample port, where the line shape of the measured
spectrum in this step (IFEFD,N,ind) is
considered to represent the line shape of the tail part of the excitation
beam. Moreover, although ISRC,N also represents
the tail part of the excitation beam, the line shapes of ISRC,N and IFEFD,N,ind are
slightly different, as shown in the inset (a-ii) of Figure 6. Here, we believe that the
line shape of IFEFD,N,ind is more representative
of the tail part of the excitation beam enclosed in IFEFD,N,dir. In step 3, an f-SiC sample was mounted on
the sample holder with the epilayer side facing toward the sample
port. For IFEFD,N,dir, we have introduced
that this spectrum contains PLFEFD(λ), which was
measured without adding the OD filter. Meanwhile, by recording IFEFD,W,dir, which was measured in wide mode
with the OD filter, one can obtain the integrated intensity of the
attenuated source beam after PL excitation (Lc), as shown in eq 5. 5  In the inset
(b-i) of Figure 6,
the peak centered at ∼375 nm in
the spectrum related to IFEBD is related
to the main peak of the excitation beam that has been largely attenuated.
In addition, the emergence of another peak centered at ∼404
nm is actually caused by the interband absorption37 related to f-SiC’s entire 6H-SiC-based structure,
where the strong absorption of the light with photon energy higher
than the band gap of 6H-SiC is expected. For step 4, the related measured
spectrum (IFEBD) at the PL-active spectral
region, i.e., 450–784 nm, is considered as the PL emission
spectrum transmitted through the 6H-SiC substrate, where the transmitted
tail part of the excitation beam can be negligible. Here, a three-step
process was developed for the extraction of PLFEBD(λ).
In the first and second steps, IFEBD and
the transmittance spectrum of the 6H-SiC substrate (i.e., TSUB) were smoothed by the Savitzky–Golay
(SG) filter at the PL-active spectral region, as shown in eqs 6 and 7. Hence, PLFEBD(λ), which represents the PL emission
spectrum at the interface of f-SiC epilayer/6H-SiC substrate, equals
the quotient between the smoothed IFEBD and TSUB, as shown in eq 8. An example of the extraction of
PLFEBD(λ) is shown in panel (a) of Figure 7. The transmittance spectra
of the 6H-SiC substrate (SiCrystal, GmbH) of the three f-SiC samples
F-1 and F-2/3 employed in this PL-QY determination experiment were
measured. Note that the same integrating sphere was applied for the
related transmittance measurements with an xenon lamp (HPX-2000, Ocean
Optics, Inc.). The raw and smooth transmittance spectra of the 6H-SiC
substrate of F-1 and F-2/3 are shown in Figure 8. 6   8  Back to the extraction of PLFEFD(λ), we have confirmed that IFEFD,N,dir can be split into PLFEFD and the tail part of the incident
excitation spectrum. For PLFEFD(λ), it has been suggested
that PLFEFD(λ) ∝ PLFEBD(λ)
since these two spectra have the same excitation condition. However, IFEFD,N,ind representing the line shape of the
tail part of the excitation spectrum at FEFD mode has been measured
in step 2. Therefore, we got the analytical expression of IFEFD,N,dir at the PL-active spectral region,
which corresponds to the linear recombination of PLFEBD(λ) and IFEFD,N,ind as shown in eq 9. By solving eq 9 using least-squares regression,
one can get PLFEFD(λ) via eq 10. An example of the extraction of PLFEFD(λ) is shown in panel (c) of Figure 7. 9   10

4.1.3 Relative
Uncertainty
Accordingly,
in this research, we can see that Pc is
composed of two components that correspond to the PL excitation under
FEFD and FEBD modes. The expression of the relative uncertainty of
PL-QY (i.e., ηPL) has to be considered by following
the law of propagating uncertainty,38 where
the expression of ηPL refers to eq 11. In eq 11, UFEBD, UFEFD, ULa, ULc, and USCR refer to the
relative uncertainties of Pc,FEBD, Pc,FEFD, La, Lc, and SCR, respectively. In addition, σx|x = FEBD,FEFD,La,Lc,SCR corresponds
to the standard deviations of each variable shown in eq 11, and the expressions included
in the angle brackets are related to the respective mean values. 11  

4.2 TRPL Measurement
In this research,
the TRPL measurements on f-SiC samples are realized by the time-correlated
single-photon counting (TCSPC) system from PicoQuant GmbH. The key
components of the TCSPC system are (a) a picosecond laser diode head
(LDH-D-C-375) with λ of 375 nm and FWHM of ∼44 ps; (b)
a computer-controlled diode laser driver (PDL 828 “Sepia II”,
two channel version); (c) a hybrid photomultiplier detector assembly
(PMA Hybrid 40); and (d) a TCSPC board (TimeHarp 260 PICO) with a
digital resolution of around 25 ps. Both the injected laser pulse
and the emitted photon signal are fiber-coupled to a 50× microscope
lens with the configuration of front excitation–front detection.
After excitation, the emitted photons are filtered by a 405 nm long-pass
filter and then transferred to a photomultiplier tube. A 2 ms time
span for photon decay sampling, a 500 Hz repetition rate of laser
pulse (i.e., 80 ns resolution), a 1 h integration time were chosen
for the TRPL measurement.
