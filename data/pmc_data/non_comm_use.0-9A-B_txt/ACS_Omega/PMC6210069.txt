G-proteins
play a central role in signal transduction by fluctuating
between “on” and “off” phases that are
determined by a conformational change. cAMP is a secondary messenger
whose formation is inhibited or stimulated by activated Giα1 or Gsα subunit. We used tryptophan fluorescence,
UV/vis spectrophotometry, and circular dichroism to probe distinct
structural features within active and inactive conformations from
wild-type and tryptophan mutants of Giα1 and Gsα. For all proteins studied, we found that the active
conformations were more stable than the inactive conformations, and
upon refolding from higher temperatures, activated wild-type subunits
recovered significantly more native structure. We also observed that
the wild-type subunits partially regained the ability to bind nucleotide.
The increased compactness observed upon activation was consistent
with the calculated decrease in solvent accessible surface area for
wild-type Giα1. We found that as the temperature
increased, Gα subunits, which are known to be rich
in α-helices, converted to proteins with increased content of
β-sheets and random coil. For active conformations from wild-type
and tryptophan mutants of Giα1, melting temperatures
indicated that denaturation starts around hydrophobic tryptophan microenvironments
and then radiates toward tyrosine residues at the surface, followed
by alteration of the secondary structure. For Gsα, however, disruption of secondary structure preceded unfolding around
tyrosine residues. In the active conformations, a π-cation interaction
between essential arginine and tryptophan residues, which was characterized
by a fluorescence-measured red shift and modeled by molecular dynamics,
was also shown to be a contributor to the stability of Gα subunits. The folding properties of Gα subunits
reported here are discussed in the context of diseases associated
to G-proteins.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Guanine nucleotide-binding
proteins (G-proteins) represent a family
of proteins involved in intricate networks of intercellular signaling.
Heterotrimeric G-proteins are comprised of α, β, and γ
subunits that interact with transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs). Upon activation of a receptor by an extracellular stimulus,
the α-subunit undergoes a conformational change that allows
exchange of guanine diphosphate (GDP) for guanine triphosphate (GTP)
with concurrent dissociation from the βγ-dimer and GPCR,
and a further relay of a signal via an interaction with an intracellular
effector. The signal terminates following hydrolysis of the bound
GTP, thereby returning the α-subunit back to its inactive state
and its reassociation with the βγ heterodimer and the
GPCR.1−3 Although there are four families of Gα proteins, we limited this study to Giα1 and Gsα, which stimulate or inhibit the production of cAMP
by regulating the activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC).

The crystal
structures from Giα1 in the inactive
GDP-bound conformation, as well as from the active states of both
Giα1 and Gsα using GTPγS,
a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, have been solved.4−6 The crystal
structure of Gsα complexed with the target AC is
also known.6 Gα is composed
of two domains: the α-helical domain and the GTPase domain.
The α-helical domain consists of six α-helices that form
a lid over the guanine nucleotide-binding site of the GTPase domain.
The GTPase domain is composed of six-stranded β-sheets surrounded
by five α-helices and in addition to the nucleotide-binding
site, the GTPase domain also contains binding sites for the Gβγ dimer and the GPCR. Also, in the GTPase domain
are the switch regions known as switches I–III that are located
near the nucleotide-binding site. The switch regions undergo a drastic
structural change when going from the inactive GDP-bound conformation
to the active GTP-bound conformation.7 In
GDP-bound Giα1, switch II and switch III are disordered
in the X-ray structure, but upon activation, they become ordered around
the γ-phosphate of GTP.4,5,8

Protein folding is a complicated and yet a surprisingly efficient
event that is critical for protein viability. Protein folding is driven
primarily by noncovalent interactions and proceeds through an energy
landscape from its unfolded state to its native conformation.9−12 The free energy of the native state is lower than that of the unfolded
protein, which is in equilibrium with molten globules that have a
native-like structure. When a protein denatures, it does not go directly
to a random coil, but rather to one of these molten globule states,
which resembles the native state and may be able to bind a ligand
and retain some activity.13−15 Improper folding of the molten
globules can have devastating consequences and is the cause of many
diseases.16

Hydrophobic interactions
contribute the most toward protein stability,
but other interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and electrostatic
interactions, are important as well.6 Tryptophan
(W) residues are uncommon and play a key role in protein stability
via hydrophobic interactions at the core of the protein. Giα1 contains three W residues, whereas Gsα has four.
The W residues in Giα1 are W131, W211, and W258 (depicted
in cyan in Figure 1), which respectively correspond to W154, W234, and W277 in Gsα. There is an additional W residue in Gsα, W281, that has no corresponding equivalent in Giα1. Gilman and co-workers reported that intrinsic W fluorescence could
be used to investigate conformational changes in Gα proteins that occur during activation because the fluorescence intensity
increases when individual W residues move toward a more hydrophobic
environment.17,18 Najor et al. built upon this
property to quantify the contribution of each W residue toward the
overall fluorescence by using phenylalanine (F) mutants of Giα1.19 We explored this feature to determine
the stability at the core of the protein by determining melting temperatures
(Tm) from wild-type (WT) and W mutants
of Giα1 and Gsα. In addition, a
π-cation interaction between W211 and R208 (W234 and R231 in
Gsα) is present in the active conformations of WT
Gα proteins, which can be detected by red shifts
in their fluorescence emission spectra. Disrupting the π-cation
interaction may also have consequences for stability.20

Figure 1 WT Giα1·GTPγS displaying its 3 tryptophan
residues (cyan), 13 tyrosine residues (purple), R208 (green), GTPγS-bound
nucleotide (orange), and Mg2+ (green sphere).

Both Giα1 and Gsα have an abundance
of tyrosine (Y) residues (13 for Giα1 and 14 in Gsα) (Figure 1) from which we can take advantage of the UV absorbance to
determine the Tm values at the surface
of the protein for WT and W mutants. Although Y as well as W residues
absorb light at 280 nm, in both Gα proteins Y residues
far outnumber W amino acids resulting in absorbance changes that are
dependent on Y and W residues. To obtain a more detailed picture of
protein unfolding, we also used circular dichroism (CD) to monitor
the secondary structure of the proteins.

Protein stability is
an important characteristic of protein function.
G-protein signaling must be tightly regulated to ensure appropriate
responses to extracellular stimuli. Improperly functioning Gα proteins have been implicated in many disease states, including
McCune-Albright syndrome, bipolar disorder, and cancer.21−24 The focus of this study was to compare the stability of WT Giα1 and WT Gsα from different vantage
points: from the inside core of the protein to its surface of the
protein and from an overview of the overall secondary structure. Second,
we investigated the contribution of each W residue individually and
probed the interaction between one of them and the nearby arginine
(R) and its effect on protein stability. To elucidate putative folding
mechanisms in disease states, we utilized several biophysical techniques
to probe the contributions of noncovalent interactions toward the
stability of Gα proteins. Computational methods were
also used to model the interactions.

2 Results
2.1 Fluorescence Emission Spectra of Gα Subunits
To calculate melting temperatures in both the
active and inactive conformations of the WT proteins, we measured
the changes in fluorescence intensity, resulting from increases in
the solvent exposure of W residues. The amino acid F was chosen as
a replacement for W because of its similar structure and size characteristics
as well as low quantum yield and distinct λmax values.19,25

The fluorescence intensity of WT Giα1·GDP
at 50 °C decreased by 53% when compared to that observed at 20
°C (Figure 2A),
and continued declining until 70 °C, at which point there was
no change in intensity and the protein was fully unfolded. A transition
midpoint (Tm) of 39 °C was calculated
for WT Giα1·GDP, and the W mutants in the same
conformation were not significantly different from the WT protein
(Table 1). For Gsα in the GDP conformation, the Tm values for the WT protein were also not significantly different
from all W mutants (Table 2).

For WT Giα1·GTPγS, the fluorescence
intensity at 50 °C was 33% of that observed at 20 °C, indicating
that the active conformation is more stable than the GDP-bound structure
(Figure 2B). Apart
from the W211F mutant, the Tm values for
the other W Giα1 mutants in the Giα1·GTPγS conformation were also significantly higher than
in the GDP conformation (Table 1). Interestingly, the WT Giα1·GTPγS
showed only a 10 °C increase, whereas the W131F and W258 mutants
in the GTPγS conformation were approximately 14 and 17 °C
higher than in their respective GDP conformations. The behavior of
WT Gsα·GTPγS and its activated mutants
was the opposite of Giα1 proteins in the GTPγS
conformation. Alignment of the protein sequences indicates that W234F
in Gsα and W211F in Giα1 are both
located in the switch II region. The W234F mutant was unique because
its Tm value in the GTPγS conformation
(33 °C) was significantly lower than in the GDP conformation
(40 °C) (Table 2), and the analogous mutation in Giα (W211F) has
essentially the same Tm in both the GDP-
and GTP-bound forms (Table 1). The Tm values for WT Gsα and its W154F, W277F, and W281F mutants in the Gsα·GTPγS conformation were not significantly
different from their GDP counterparts.

2.2 π-Cation
Interactions in Gα Subunits
To gain insight
into the stability of the switch
II region in WT Giα1, which co-ordinates with Mg2+ and the nucleotide-binding pocket, we monitored the π-cation
interaction between R208 and W211 that occurs upon activation from
the GDP-bound to the GTPγS conformation. At 20 °C, the
λmax position exhibited a red shift of 3.5 nm (Figure 3A), which gradually
decreased until 70 °C, at which point the instability of the
GDP conformation prevented further measurements (Figure 3B). Similar changes in the
value of the λmax position were observed for the
WT Gsα protein until around 53 °C, where it
switched from a red to a blue shift (data not shown).

and after (red) activation with GTPγS

the λmax values of the GTPγS and GDP conformations.

2.3 UV/Vis
Absorption Spectra of Gα Subunits
A useful
property of Gα proteins
is that W residues move to the hydrophobic core of the protein upon
activation.8 Thus, the spectroscopic and
thermal properties of these sites allow for probing the interior of
Gα subunits by using fluorescence emission spectroscopy.
By contrast, Y residues are predominantly located at the surface of
the Gα protein and are therefore useful for determining
information on structural changes at or near the exterior of the protein.8 As the protein unfolds, Y and W residues begin
to contribute toward the absorbance. Because W has an absorptivity
that is 4 times larger than Y at 280 nm, W would contribute significantly
toward the Δabs as a result of the relative number
of Y vs W residues in Giα1 (3 vs 13) and in Gsα (4 vs 14). In contrast, F absorptivity
is approximately 30-fold lower than that of Tyr and the λmax is 257 nm, resulting in a negligible contribution toward
absorbance at 280 nm.

An increase in absorbance intensity at
280 nm, which was associated to Y and W residues becoming more solvent
exposed, was observed at temperatures above 44 °C for WT Giα1·GDP. The melting curve for Giα1 in the GTPγS form was shifted to the right of the GDP conformation
(Figure 4a). A Tm value of 48 °C was calculated for WT
Giα1·GDP and 54 °C for WT Gsα·GDP, and for the W mutants, the Tm values were not significantly different from their WT GDP counterparts
(Tables 1 and 2). For the GTPγS conformations, the Tm values for WT Giα1 and WT
Gsα were significantly higher than for the GDP counterparts,
but were not significantly different for proteins, in which the W
residue involved in a π-cation interaction was mutated to F,
i.e., W211F for Giα1 and W234F for Gsα (Tables 1 and 2).

WT Giα1·GDP·Mg2+.

2.4 Temperature Dependence
of the Secondary Structure
of Gα Subunits
At 20 °C, the CD spectra
of WT Giα1·GDP (Table 3) and of WT Gsα·GDP
(Table 4) were indicative
of proteins that have secondary structures rich in α-helix (40
and 36%, respectively). The percent of α-helix that we observed
for WT Giα1·GDP was in agreement to that also
reported by others using CD (43%), which is less than in the reported
structure deposited in the PDB (47%).8,26 As the temperature
increased, the CD absorbance intensity at 190 nm decreased, whereas
the minima at 205 nm and 222 nm, which are signatures of α-helix,
converged to a new minimum at 215 nm (Figure 4B).

The data in Table 3 indicated that regardless
of the conformation, WT Giα1 initially was predominantly
α-helical, but at higher temperatures,
it became increasingly dominated by β-strands and to a lesser
extent by random coil. By comparison, WT Gsα in both
conformations had less α-helical and turn content, but more
random coil and had a less dramatic α/β temperature-induced
conversion (Table 4). A CD-determined Tm value of 44 °C
was calculated for WT Giα1·GDP, while the W211F
mutant afforded the highest Tm value (Table 1). Experiments with
WT Giα1·GDP at temperatures greater than 64
°C did not exhibit significant changes in the CD spectra, with
the protein eventually precipitating out of solution at 84 °C.
Apart from the W211F mutant, WT and W mutants of Giα1 in the GTPγS conformation withstood temperatures near 100
°C without precipitation.

At 80 °C, the secondary
structure of WT Giα1 protein in the active conformation
had at least an additional 5%
of α-helix content compared to the GDP conformation (Table 3). Except for the
Gsα W234F and W211F Giα1 mutants,
the Tm values for the active conformations
of WT Gsα and the remaining W mutants are significantly
higher than for the inactive forms. The CD-determined Tm values for the inactive and active conformations of
W234F Gsα and W211F Giα1 are not
significantly different, and the Tm values
for the active conformations are significantly lower when compared
to the WT proteins (Table 2).

2.5 Refolding
We have
also investigated
the ability of Gα subunits to refold after completion
of the denaturation process. A decrease in temperature was accompanied
by an increase in fluorescence intensity indicating that the W residues
were refolding into hydrophobic environments, as demonstrated for
WT Giα1·GTPγS (Figure 5A). Refolding WT Giα1·GDP
from 96 to 4 °C exhibited no significant increase in fluorescence,
however, upon renaturation from 48 °C, the observed increase
in the fluorescence intensity indicated a refolding recovery of 21%
(Figure 5B). When refolding
from 32 °C, which is less than the fluorescence-determined Tm value of 39 °C (Table 1), WT Giα1·GDP exhibited
the largest recovery (72%). Unlike WT Giα1·GDP,
the GTPγS conformation experienced increases in fluorescence
intensity even when refolding was initiated from 96 °C, i.e.,
at temperatures larger than the Tm (Figure 5B and Table 1). These observations demonstrate
that the ability of Gα subunits to refold is conformation-dependent.
Although this is the case for both Gα proteins, WT
Giα1 was able to recover the most folded structure
compared to WT Gsα (spectra not shown). Such traits
were drawn out by fluorescence spectra of WT Giα1·GTPγS that revealed a 76% recovery after denaturation
at temperatures up to 70 °C. By contrast, we found that WT Gsα·GTPγS only recovered 30% of its folded
structure after denaturation at temperatures ≤ 84 °C.
In addition, WT Gsα·GDP precipitated at temperatures
less than 80 °C during renaturation.

via emission spectroscopy. Spectra shown were scaled to fluorescence
intensities at 450 nm. (B) Percent fluorescence recovered after refolding
of WT Giα1. Temperatures denote the maximum temperatures
to which protein solutions were exposed before cooling. (C) Probing
of denaturation and refolding of WT Giα1·GDP
by circular dichroism. R represents refolded Giα1.

CD was also used to monitor the
reversibility of protein unfolding.
As shown in Figure 5C, when WT Giα1·GDP was cooled from 76 to 20
°C, there was a concomitant increase in the spectral intensity
at 190 nm and a decrease at 222 nm. Spectral deconvolution showed
that at 80 °C, WT Giα1·GDP consisted primarily
of 18% α-helices and 32% β-sheets (Table 3), but protein refolding back to 20 °C
increased the α-helical content to 31%, whereas the percentage
of β-sheets decreased to 18%. Terminating the denaturation process
at 52 °C rather than at 76 °C resulted in recovery of 88%
of the original α-helical structure. Similar effects were observed
with WT Giα1·GTPγS. Although this conformation
was more resistant to unfolding as evidenced by an initial 44% α-helical
content at 20 °C (Table 3), 93% of which was recovered when refolding from 76 to 20
°C.

To ascertain whether the partial recovery of structural
refolding
described above translated into a gain in protein activity, we investigated
the kinetics of GTPγS binding at several temperatures (Figure 6). Because of differences
in protein stability, the decrease in fluorescence intensity for the
protein in the inactive conformation is larger than in the active
conformation (Figure 2). Consequently, normalizing the initial fluorescence intensities
of WT Giα1 in the GDP conformation at 40 and 30 °C
to the same value accounts for the maximal fluorescence intensity
observed upon GTPγS binding being the largest at 40 °C
(Figure 6). Heating
WT Giα1 to 30 °C followed by cooling to 20 °C
resulted in approximately 45% recovery of GTPγS binding, but
when the protein was heated to 40 °C and then cooled to 20 °C,
no GTPγS binding was found. As shown in Table 1, the melting temperature of WT Giα1 in the GDP conformation as measured by fluorescence is 39 °C,
indicating that WT Giα1·GDP is unstable at 40
°C for GDP → GTPγS exchange to occur. In summary,
these findings indicate that Gα subunits have the
ability to partially regain GTPγS binding activity (Figure 6) and that to some
extent, refold the structure as demonstrated by our data obtained
with two independent spectroscopic methods (fluorescence and circular
dichroism; Figure 5). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a regain
of function after refolding was reported for Gα subunits.

3 Discussion
Protein
stability is critical for biological function. Our study
focused on characterizing the noncovalent interactions that contribute
to the stability of Gα proteins and to the reformation
of the protein structure after unfolding. Surprisingly, given the
importance of Gα proteins, there have been few studies
of their stabilities.27−29 In vivo, chaperones contribute toward protein stability.
With respect to Gα subunits, the Ric-8A and Ric-8B
chaperones play a part in the folding of nascent Giα1 and Gsα.30

A comparison
of the WT Giα1 crystal structures
in the GDP and GTPγS conformations reveals that the GDP-bound
structure has a larger surface area than the active GTPγS conformation.5,8 One would predict that compared to the GDP form, a denser folding
profile for the GTPγS conformation of WT Giα1 would result in a more stable structure, as evidenced by the higher Tm values calculated from fluorescence emission,
combined Y and W absorption, and CD spectra as well as from the larger
interaction energies calculated for the GTP-bound protein (Tables 1 and 5). This conclusion is also supported by solvent accessible
surface area (SASA) calculations for WT Giα1 indicating
that protein activation resulted in a 2.6% decrease in overall solvent
exposure (19 520 Å2 for GDP-bound protein vs
19 010 Å2 for the active conformation). Therefore,
WT Giα1·GTPγS is more stable, thus requiring
more energy to unfold.

Utilizing W → F single-point
mutations, we followed the
unfolding by measuring the temperature dependence of the fluorescence
emission spectra of nine Gα proteins (WT and three
W mutants of Giα1 and WT and four W mutants of Gsα) in the inactive GDP and active GTPγS conformations.
Because burial of W residues in hydrophobic pockets is known to result
in an increase in ΔFmax, protein
unfolding is accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity.31 In the GDP forms (Table 1), the fluorescence-measured Tm values for WT Giα1 were not significantly
different (p < 0.1) from its W mutants. Except
for the W211F mutant, the Tm values were,
however, significantly smaller than for the active WT Giα1, W131F, and W258F proteins (p < 0.01). The GTPγS
conformation of the W211F mutant proved to be the least stable of
all of the active Giα1 proteins and displayed a fluorescence-derived Tm value similar to its GDP conformation (Table 1), which is the opposite
of the general trend of higher melting temperatures observed for the
GTPγS conformations. The difference in the interaction energies
for the GDP and GTP found during the molecular dynamics simulations
was smaller for the W211F variant than for the WT, which might contribute
to the active conformation of this mutant being less stable.

Unlike WT Giα1, for which crystal structures are
known for the inactive and active conformations, only the structure
of WT Gsα·GTPγS has been published, precluding
an explanation of protein stability based on compactness or differences
in GTP and GDP interaction energies with the protein.5,8,32 The fluorescence-derived data
in Table 2 indicate
that WT Gsα and its mutants do not follow the same
folding pattern as for Giα1. For Tm values calculated from fluorescence spectra, there is
no significant difference between the active and inactive conformations
of WT Gsα and of its W154F, W277F, and W281F mutants
suggesting that with the exception of W234F Gsα,
stability of the protein structure around the W residues in Gsα is different from Giα1. Figure 7 shows that at room
temperature, the ΔFmax values were
significantly lower for WT Gsα relative to WT Giα1. Since ΔFmax is
a result of W movement, this trend suggests that after activation
a smaller displacement of the W residues occurs in Gsα compared to Giα1. Therefore, unlike WT Giα1, the W residues in the GDP conformation of WT Gsα are relatively protected in hydrophobic environments, presumably
accounting for the insignificant difference between the Tm values from WT Gsα·GTPγS
and WT Gsα·GDP (Table 2). The insignificant differences between
the Tm values from the active and inactive
conformations of the W154F, W277F, and W281F mutants of Gsα are likely to have the same origin.

of Gsα do not show detectable changes in ΔFmax (Figure 7, panels A and B). The W211 residue in WT Giα1 has been shown to have the largest difference in solvent accessibility
between the inactive and active conformations and therefore contributes
the most toward ΔFmax.19 Not surprisingly, for the W211F mutant of Giα1, no ΔFmax is observed
(Figure 7B). Similarly,
the W234 residue in Gsα likely undergoes a similar
large decrease in solvent accessibility during the course of the conformational
change, as evidenced by the negligible ΔFmax observed in the W234F mutant (Figure 7A). The fluorescence-derived Tm values for the W211F mutant of Giα1 are not statistically different in the two conformations (Table 1) presumably because
of the absence of the W211-R208 cation−π interaction.
Interestingly, the Tm value for the W234F
mutant is significantly lower than for WT Gsα (Table 2).

The secondary
structure of WT Giα1 proved to be
the most stable in its GTPγS form relative to the GDP conformation
(Table 1). At 20 °C
and upon binding of GTPγS, we identified a 4% increase in the
α-helical content of WT Giα1 (Table 3), but not for WT Gsα (Table 4). Activation
of WT Giα1 creates a hydrophobic pocket via folding
of the switch regions, resulting in a protein that has an ordered
secondary structure with an increased α-helical content.4,8 The smaller ΔFmax observed for
activation of WT Gsα relative to WT Giα1 (Figure 7) may be
related to a smaller change in the secondary structure of WT Gsα. In either conformation, as the temperature increased,
the α-helical content of both WT Gα proteins
was reduced and the subunits became richer in β-sheet while
the random coil and turn structures were not altered significantly
from the native form. We have done molecular dynamics simulations
of the thermal unfolding of the monomeric Gα proteins
and have not observed an increase in β-sheet, although the amount
of α-helix decreased. These simulations may indicate that the
β-sheet increase is due to aggregation.

A shift in secondary
structure from primarily α-helices to
β-sheets poses an increased risk for protein aggregation that
may lead to amyloidogenesis.16 Amyloid
fibril formation occurs when unfolded, native-like proteins aggregate
into long filaments of packed β-sheets.33−35 Many debilitating
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s, Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s,
and Alzheimer’s, have been proposed to arise from the accumulation
of amyloid fibrils in the brain or in the central nervous system.16 In vitro studies have shown that it is not uncommon
for proteins to form amyloid fibrils under denaturing conditions.36,37 Furthermore, fibril formation has been shown to inhibit refolding
into the native conformation.38

The
absorbance assays helped visualize the global unfolding of
Gα subunits from another perspective. The Tm values for WT Giα1 that were
calculated from the absorbance of Y and W residues correlate to the
unfolding process (Figure 4A). UV/vis experiments with Giα1 showed that
the protein surface in the GTPγS conformation to be significantly
more stable than the W microenvironments, whereas the CD-determined
values indicated that the surface unfolded before the secondary structure
(Table 1). In the case
of WT Gsα·GTPγS, the UV/vis-calculated Tm value was the highest compared to those derived
from the other measurements, indicating that the surface of the WT
Gsα is the last to unfold (Table 2). In the W211F mutant of Giα1 and in the W234F mutant of Gsα, no significant
difference between the Tm values was observed
upon activation. One possibility is that π–cation interactions,
involving W211 in Giα1 and W234 in Gsα, affect unfolding proximal to Y and W residues. π–cation
interactions are found in many proteins.39,40 They are known to contribute significantly to thermal stability.41,42 The average energy for W–cation interactions is −2.9
± 1.4 kcal/mol.41,42 For the W154F, W277F, and W281F
mutants of Gsα, the UV/vis-determined Tm values were significantly higher for the active conformations.
For Giα1, however, only the W258F mutant was stabilized,
suggesting a distinct folding pattern for the two Gα subunits in each conformation.

We have examined the thermal
denaturation of the Gα proteins using three different
optical probes: absorbance, fluorescence,
and CD. These probes primarily measure changes in the environments
of Y residues or W residues or the secondary structure, respectively.
Since they give different Tm values for
the same protein (Tables 1 and 2), the denaturation of both Gα proteins appears to be multistate rather than two state.43 The differences in Tm values in Gα that were observed by different methods
may be rationalized via an analysis of the hydrophobic interactions,
which are fundamental folding determinants for all proteins. Noncovalent
interactions underpin the driving forces in protein folding. The observed Tm values suggest that denaturation of the active
conformation of Giα1 starts near W131 and W258 microenvironments,
and then propagates outward through the protein surface where the
Y residue proximal to W258 is located, and at this point of unfolding
leaving the secondary structure intact. Additional heating results
in the conversion of α-helixes into β-sheets and random
coil, possibly involving aggregation until precipitation occurs. In
contrast, denaturation of the active conformation of Gsα initiates equally around all W residues, continuing to the secondary
structure and is completed near the Y residues.

The robustness
and resistance of a protein to misfolding minimize
the chances for disease. The reversibility of folding observed with
WT Giα1 via fluorescence emission and CD (Figure 5a,c) can therefore
shed important light on the misfolding of Gα subunits.
During the course of denaturation, a protein may develop multiple
intermediate conformations, or molten globule states, which are reflected
by the different Tm values obtained by
the three techniques.44 The fluorescence
spectra monitored, to a significant degree, the polarity changes surrounding
the W sites. Oscillations of the nonpolar side chains at these sites
would generate molten globules with relatively low thermal energies.
These movements would account for the lower Tm values calculated from fluorescence measurements, compared
to those obtained with the other two spectroscopic probes. Multiple
Y residues, which may be involved in hydrogen bonding, are distributed
throughout Gα. Once protein unfolding is initiated,
molten globule states that are populated will exhibit diminished secondary
structure, which is determined by hydrogen bonding. The additional
contribution of hydrogen bonding associated with Y microenvironments
and secondary structure relative to primarily hydrophobic interactions
present in the vicinities of W residues may explain the higher Tm values measured from Y absorption and CD spectra.

Previous work by Najor et al. and Hamm and co-workers showed that
W211 forms a π–cation interaction with R208 in WT Giα1·GTPγS, as evidenced by a red shift of
2.5 nm in the λmax value (Figure 3a).19,20 Molecular dynamic simulations
predict that the conformational change from the inactive to the active
conformation results in an increase in the electrostatic interaction
between W211 and R208 from −0.96 to −2.85 kcal/mol,
which is consistent to the higher stability seen in the active conformation
(Table 5). Thus, stronger
ligand–protein interactions would help stabilize the GTPγS-bound
structure. Molecular dynamics studies showed that the interaction
energy between GTP and Giα1 at 323 K (−621.7
kcal/mol) indicated that GTP binds more tightly than GDP (−494.4
kcal/mol). This binding energy partially may explain why the GTP-bound
structure refolds better.

An increase in temperature at which
the simulation was conducted
(37 → 50 °C) resulted in weakening of the W211-R208 π–cation
interaction, which is supported by the observed decrease in the Δλmax (Figure 3b). The increased van der Waals interactions calculated at higher
temperatures may be associated with these residues swinging into more
hydrophilic environments upon unfolding. This conclusion is supported
by a blue (rather than red) shift observed upon the GTPγS activation
of Gsα at temperatures higher than 53 °C. For
the W211F mutant of Giα1, there was no significant
difference between the Tm values from
the active and inactive conformations further suggesting that the
π–cation interaction is important for the structural
integrity of Giα1.

This study underscores the
importance of π–cation
interactions toward protein stability. The disruption of these noncovalent
interactions may lead to significant decreases in the stabilities
for the active conformations of Gα subunits and could
promote improper folding. Mutations of the arginine residue involved
in the π–cation interaction have been identified in the
R208Q Giα1 and in the R231H Gsα oncogenes
and are thought to have similar characteristics as the W mutants.23 The loss of the π–cation interaction
could translate into changes in structure–function relationships
by disrupting the signaling cascade for cAMP. Future studies will
focus on the effect of these mutations on the structure and function
of oncogenic Gα subunits.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Expression and Protein Purification
Gαi1 and Gsα were obtained and
purified as previously described.45 Single-point
W mutants of Gαi1 and Gsα were prepared
by site-directed mutagenesis using a kit provided by Stratagene (La
Jolla, CA). After purification on a Ni2+ affinity column
followed by a Superdex 200 pg size exclusion column, the purity of
GDP-bound Gα proteins was found to be greater than
95% as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. Protein was stored at −80 °C in 20 mM
Tris, pH 8.0 buffer containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT).

4.2 Fluorescence Measurements of Protein Activation
Experiments were performed with a PTI QuantaMaster fluorimeter
(Photon Technologies, Inc., Mirmingham, NJ). Indirect activity assays
were conducted with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 280
and 340 nm, respectively. Assays were initiated after 60 s by addition
of 20 μM of GTPγS to preincubated 400 nM Gα·GDP protein samples in buffer containing 50 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgSO4, and 1 mM DTT, and was monitored
for 3 h at 25 °C. The GDP- and GTPγS-bound proteins that
were characterized by the activity assays were used in the following
denaturation studies.

4.3 Fluorescence-Measured Protein
Denaturation
Emission spectra for both GDP- and GTPγS-bound
proteins were
recorded over the wavelength range of 300–400 nm with the excitation
wavelength set at 280 nm. Signal integration time was 0.2 s with the
bandpass for excitation and for emission set at 5 nm. The denaturation
experiments started at a temperature of 4 °C followed by 4 °C
increments and concluding at the highest temperature before precipitation
occurred. There was a 2 min equilibration period at each set temperature.
All Tm values were calculated from fluorescence
intensities at the spectral λmax positions for the
selected temperatures, using methods adapted from those previously
described.46

4.4 UV/Vis-Measured
Protein Denaturation
The environments of Y (and to a lesser
extent W) residues in Gα proteins were monitored
on a Hewlett Packard UV/vis
spectrophotometer. All samples contained 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 μM
Gα·GDP protein, 1 mM DTT, and 2 mM MgSO4. Prior to initiating the experiments, samples were incubated
with their respective nucleotide, 2.5 μM Gα·GDP or 20 μM GTPγS, at room temperature for 1 h.
The temperature was increased from 20 to 80 °C, at 0.3 °C/min
over 180 min. For each temperature studied, samples were equilibrated
for 1 min, and the absorbance was monitored in the wavelength range
of 220–300 nm. All melting temperatures were calculated from
the absorbance values at 280 nm for the different temperatures, using
methods previously described.47

4.5 CD-Measured Protein Denaturation
Experiments were performed
using an Olis DSM 20 circular dichroism
spectrophotometer. All samples were measured in a cylindrical quartz
cuvette with a 1 mm pathlength and contained either 3 μM Gα·GDP or 24 μM Gα·GTPγS,
in 10 mM phosphate, pH 7.5 buffer, 1 mM DTT, and 2 mM MgSO4. Data were collected at 150 V every 1 nm in the wavelength range
of 190–260 nm. The temperature was increased from 20 to 100
°C at 4 °C increments with an incubation time of 3 min at
each temperature studied. The CONTIN LL algorithm was used to deconvolute
the spectra using reference sets with denatured proteins to calculate
the percent of each type of secondary structure and Tm values for each protein studied.48−50

4.6 Refolding of Gα Subunits
To test whether
unfolding of Gα proteins was reversible,
fluorescence emission scans and CD spectrophotometry were used. Once
spectra from the final temperature of an unfolding experiment were
obtained, Gα samples were cooled down in 8 °C
increments and incubation times remained the same as indicated above
for each respective technique. Final temperatures varied depending
on aggregation and ability to refold. All renaturation experiments
were stopped at 4 °C for fluorescence measurements and at 20
°C for CD experiments.

4.7 Molecular Modeling
The co-ordinates
of GDP (1BOF8) and GTPγS (1GIA5) derivatives of Giα1 and GTPγS
of Gsα (1AZT32) were downloaded
from the Protein Data Bank (PDB51). Missing
loops in the Giα1 structures were modeled using Swiss
Model52 and the corresponding transducin
structures (1TAG,53 1TAD,54 and 1TND55). The simulations
were done using procedures previously described.19 Unrestrained dynamics was run for 14 ns before the data
were acquired for an additional 1 ns. The simulations were done at
37 °C (310 K) and 50 °C (328 K). These data were then used
in the analyses. The initial W point mutation models were generated
using VMD56 and then subjected to the same
equilibration procedure as the wild-type structures. All molecular
graphic diagrams were generated using VMD.56 Pairwise van der Waals and electrostatic interaction energies were
calculated using NAMD.57 The solvent accessible
surface area (SASA) was measured with the SASA routine in VMD.56 The SASA values and the van der Waals and electrostatic
energy values presented in Table 5 were calculated for the final 1 ns in each simulation
and then averaged.
