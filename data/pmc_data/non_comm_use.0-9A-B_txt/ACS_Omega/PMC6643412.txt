In this investigation,
we report the synthesis of biodiesel using
benzimidazolium-based brønsted acid ionic liquid (BBAIL) catalyst
under the influence of ultrasonication. The prepared BBAIL catalyst
was characterized by Fourier transform infrared and NMR spectroscopy
techniques, and its acidity was determined by the Hammett method with
4-nitroaniline as the indicator. Ultrasonicator horn (22 kHz, 500
W) was used in this work with an on–off cycle of 50–20
s at 70% amplitude. The highest biodiesel yield of 96% was achieved
by ultrasonication when 1:10 molar ratio of castor oil to methyl alcohol
was used at 50 °C temperature with 9 mol % of the catalyst in
just 90 min, which is about 10 times lesser than the process without
ultrasonication. At similar conditions, 96% biodiesel yield was obtained
in 14 h without ultrasonication. In summary, ultrasonication proved
to be an efficient way to improve biodiesel synthesis in less time
and BBAIL showed excellent activity toward the conversion of glycerides
to synthesize biodiesel. Other important highlights are easy separation
of the catalyst and recyclability up to three cycles with small decrease
in its activity.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Biodiesel
is long believed that it can potentially provide an alternative
to current/future fuel scarcity. As biodiesel from edible oils is
impractical because of the fuel vs food issues, using nonedible oil
for biodiesel synthesis is lucrative. One such alternative biodiesel
source is castor oil, which is extracted from castor beans (also called
as Ricinus communis L.). It mainly
consists of ricinoleic acid, approximately 80–90%. Other constituents
are 3–6% linoleic acid, 2–4% oleic acid, and 1–5%
saturated fatty acids.1 Ricinoleic acid,
a fatty acid, contains both a double bond and a hydroxyl group that
makes it a favorable additive for diesel fuel.2,3 According
to the estimate by Patel et al.,4 the estimated
overall worldwide production of the castor oil seed was 1.5 MMT.

Transesterification of the oils can take place with alcohol using
both homogeneous5,6 and heterogeneous catalysts.7−9 Alkaline catalysts generally result in faster transesterification
than acid catalysts. However, separation of these catalysts is complex.
Although acid and base catalysts are efficient, they have other many
demerits such as they are (1) not renewable, (2) corrosive, (3) not
eco-friendly, (4) vulnerable toward saponification, and (5) difficult
to separate.10 Hence, it is important to
prepare environment-friendly catalysts for biodiesel production. Ionic
liquids (IL), a type of organic salts, consist of organic cations
and organic or inorganic anions, and are typically termed as green
solvents.11 Among several advantages offered
by IL are: (i) negligible vapor pressure, (ii) good solvents, (iii)
a few of them are immiscible with organic solvents, (iv) better thermal
as well as chemical stability, and (v) nonflammability.11

Ullah et al.12 investigated the transformation
of waste palm cooking oil to biodiesel using acidic IL as a catalyst.
They used 5 wt % BMIMHSO4, a methyl alcohol (MA)-to-oil
molar ratio of 15:1, a reaction time of 60 min, a temperature of 160
°C, and mixing at 600 rpm to reduce the acid value to less than
1.0 mg KOH/g in the first step. The second step of transesterification
used 1.0 wt % KOH at 60 °C for 60 min. The final yield obtained
was about 96 wt %. Qiu et al.13 investigated
the catalytic activities of four novel Brønsted acidic ionic
liquids for the biodiesel synthesis through the conversion of coconut
oil and MA. The maximum biodiesel yield of about 99% was obtained
at the optimal reaction conditions. Feng et al.14 studied the conversion of palm oil with MA catalyzed by
Brønsted acidic ionic liquids. They obtained a biodiesel yield
of 98.4% with a reaction time of 150 min. Fang et al.10 used the alkali ionic liquid [BTBD]OH to convert castor
oil to biodiesel with 96% yield at the optimal conditions. Joshi et
al.15 studied the biodiesel process intensification
using a heterogeneous catalyst with a high-speed homogenizer; soybean
oil and waste cooking oil were successfully converted to biodiesel.
They reported the impressive outcome of the sonification on the biodiesel
production. Su et al.16 developed a dual-core
acidic ionic liquid [DABCO-PS] [HSO4], and it was used
to transesterify castor oil to prepare biodiesel. The optimal conditions
were obtained as: molar ratio of MA to castor oil, 12:1, 4 wt % ionic
liquid catalyst, 50 °C temperature, and 1 h reaction time. Under
these conditions, the yield of biodiesel was 90%.16

Other authors1,17,18 studied the production of biodiesel with good yield from castor
oil using various light alcohols, including irradiation conditions.
Due to the high viscosity and density of biodiesel produced from castor
oil, it can be blended with petro-diesel to be used in combustion
engines.19,20 However, blending castor oil biodiesel with
petro-diesel in higher proportions may result in higher emissions
of hydrocarbons and carbon.21,22 Despite few drawbacks,
it is attractive due to the properties such as lubricity, high flash
point, and better emission profiles at optimum blending.

Due
to the immiscible nature of the reactants, transesterification
is mass transfer limited yielding a low reaction rate; hence, notably,
the traditional approaches presented above typically require long
reaction time and high energy. These shortcomings can be addressed
using intensification methods. One such method is the application
of cavitational reactors.23 Cavitation
refers to the generation of cavities that grow to the largest possible
size and collapse intensely due to the pressure alterations. This
may result in local hot spots with acute temperature (500–15 000
K) and pressure (100–5000 atm) and physical effects such as
extremely high turbulence and liquid streaming.24,25 Ultrasonic and hydrodynamic cavitation mechanisms have been vastly
studied for biodiesel synthesis using waste cooking oil,26,27 palm fatty acid,28 palm oil,29 nagchampa oil,30,31 and karanja
oil.32 Ultrasonication is considered as
one of the most attractive alternative techniques to enhance biodiesel
production.33 The reaction is accelerated
due to the increased collisions between reactants as a result of vibration
and turbulences arising from the cavitation phenomenon.33 Previous studies34,35 found that
duty cycle, frequency, and amplitude of the ultrasonication decide
the extent of energy introduced and the nature of influence on biodiesel
yield.

Subhedar and Gogate36 studied
the ultrasound-assisted
biodiesel production from waste cooking oil with methyl acetate and
immobilized lipase catalyst. They obtained 96.1% biodiesel yield at
the optimum conditions. Joshi et al.37 investigated
the esterification of oil containing high free fatty acids (FFA) in
the presence of a horn-type ultrasonicator and flow cell. Optimal
operating conditions were found through response surface methodology
(RSM). The highest conversion of 77% was obtained at the optimized
conditions: 1:6 oil-to-MA ratio, 1.5 wt % catalyst, 70% duty cycle,
and 90 min reaction time. Ultrasound-assisted transesterification
parameters were optimized by Sáez-Bastante et al.,38 who obtained 20 kHz fixed frequency, 70% duty
cycle, 40% sonication amplitude, 4.87 MA-to-oil molar ratio, 1.4 wt
% catalyst, and three sonication cycles as optimal conditions. They
obtained 86.57 wt % biodiesel yield. Attia et al.39 studied the synthesis of biodiesel by castor oil transesterification
using KOH as catalyst in the presence of sonification using the factorial
design and response surface methodology. Their model equation demonstrated
the relation between the reaction parameters and the response.

From the above studies, it is clear that although researchers have
used ultrasonication technique and ionic liquid catalysts separately,
no study has appeared above that investigated the combined effect
of Brønsted acid ionic liquid and ultrasonication on the transesterification
of castor oil. The aim of this study is to synthesize high-quality
biodiesel, i.e., methyl ricinoleate, with high yield using ultrasonication
in the presence of a suitable ionic liquid catalyst, i.e., BBAIL.
In addition to acidity measurement, the developed BBAIL catalyst was
characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and NMR spectroscopy
techniques. Factors such as ultrasonication duty cycle, reaction temperature,
catalyst amount, reaction time, and oil-to-methyl alcohol (MA) molar
ratio were investigated for their influence on biodiesel yield. Then,
the properties of 10, 20, and 30% biodiesel blend with petro-diesel
were tested to analyze its potential practical applications. Short
reaction time, high biodiesel yield, ease of catalyst separation and
reusability, and production of desired acetylated glycerol are the
major highlights of this study.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Materials
MA used in the reaction
was of HPLC grade. Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) (98%), which was
recrystallized using MA, was purchased from Avra Synthesis. Castor
oil, NaOH (60% suspension in paraffin oil), 98% concentrated H2SO4, and benzimidazole were obtained from SD Fine
Chemicals. 1,4-Butane sultone, methyl imidazole, and 4-vinylbenzyl
chloride (90%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India.

2.1.1 Synthesis of Benzimidazolium-Based Brønsted
Acid Ionic Liquid (BBAIL) Catalyst
In the first step, 1-ethyl-1H-benzimidazole was prepared. 4-(1-Ethyl-1H-benzimidazole-3-yl)butane-1-sulfonate was prepared in step 2. Later
in step 3, sulfonation of 4-(1-ethyl-1H-benzimidazole-3-yl)butane-1-sulfonate
was done to obtain BBAIL. NMR and FT-IR spectra for BBAIL are given
in detail in Supporting Information (Figures S1 and S2). The detailed procedure for BBAIL development can be
obtained from Khiratkar et al.40

2.1.2 Acidity of BBAIL Catalyst
The acidity
of the synthesized BBAIL catalyst was measured using UV–vis
spectroscopy and presented as Hammett value (Ho). As seen from Figure 1, the absorbance
of an unprotonated form of the indicator (i.e., 4-nitroaniline) was
reduced due to the added catalyst. The acidity of the BBAIL catalyst
depends on the cation.

Figure 1 Absorbance of an indicator with BBAIL at 25 °C.

2.2 Experimental
Setup
Horn-type ultrasonicator
(22 kHz and 500 W) was used in this study as the source of ultrasonication.
The reactor was partly immersed in a 1 L capacity oil bath for maintaining
the temperature, as shown in Figure 2. An ultrasonic horn of diameter 12 mm was dipped into
reaction mixture.

Figure 2 Schematic of the experimental setup.

2.3 Characterization
Tetramethyl silane
(TMS) was used as an internal standard for NMR spectra, which were
taken in DMSO-d6, D2O, and
CDCl3 on a Bruker spectrometer (400 MHz). Using the KBr
pellet method, FT-IR spectra were taken on an IR affinity-1 Shimadzu
FT-IR spectrophotometer.

2.4 Biodiesel Synthesis
Figure 2 depicts the
schematic of the
experimental setup. Initially, 5 mmol, i.e., 4.66 g of castor oil,
60 mmol, i.e., 1.92 g of MA (i.e., 1:12 oil-to-MA molar ratio), and
5 mol % (i.e., ∼2 wt %) of BBAIL catalyst were taken in a flask.
These parameters were chosen as the starting point as these were found
to be the optimum in our earlier study,40 where mechanical stirring was carried out. A biodiesel yield of
96% was achieved using 1:12 castor oil-to-MA molar ratio with 5 mol
% catalyst at 40 °C in 14 h. In the present study, intensification
was carried out using a horn-type ultrasonicator. Ultrasonicator horn
(20 kHz, 500 W) was used to enhance biodiesel production. Scheme 1 presents the castor
oil transesterification mechanism in the presence of MA and BBAIL
to produce biodiesel, i.e., methyl ricinoleate.

Scheme 1 BBAIL-Catalyzed Conversion
of Castor Oil40
Following the reaction, ultrasonication was removed and
the reaction
mixture was brought to room temperature to stop the reaction. The
excess MA, after the reaction, was separated under vacuum. Then, the
reaction solution was taken in a separating funnel and ethyl acetate
and brine water were added to separate ester from glycerin and BBAIL.
After some time, two layers were formed: a top layer of ester and
a bottom layer of glycerin and BBAIL. The glycerol in the bottom layer
was then converted acetyl glycerol by acetylation in toluene. As BBAIL
is soluble in water, water was then added to the solution to remove
the catalyst. Later, water was removed using a rotary evaporator and
the catalyst was recovered. The catalyst was then dried and used for
subsequent runs. Finally, the produced biodiesel was characterized
by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and FT-IR spectroscopy techniques.

The amount of MA was varied to maintain different oil-to-MA molar
ratios, i.e., 40 mmol (for 1:8), 50 mmol (for 1:10), and 60 mmol (for
1:12). The temperature (bath temperature) was varied between room
temperature and 60 °C. Also, the amount of BBAIL catalyst was
varied to maintain different catalyst loadings, i.e., 3, 5, 8, and
10 mol %. To investigate the potential use of the produced biodiesel,
various properties of 10, 20, and 30% methyl ricinoleate blend in
real diesel were found and compared to those of the petro-diesel sample.
These results are presented and discussed in the following section.

3 Results and Discussion
As noted earlier,
96% biodiesel yield (isolated) was obtained in
14 h using 1:12 molar ratio of castor oil to MA with 5 mol % catalyst
at 40 °C in our previous study,40 where
mechanical stirring was performed. These results were reconfirmed
in the present work. Isolated, i.e., theoretical, yield was found
based on the transesterification reaction stoichiometry. According
to the stoichiometry, 1 mol of oil gives 3 mol of methyl ester, i.e.,
biodiesel. Considering 100% yield, 927 g of oil shall give 936 g (i.e.,
3 × 312) of biodiesel (using molecular weights). Hence, theoretically,
1.5 mL, i.e., 1.425 g (using density = 0.95 g/mL) of oil should produce
1.438 g of biodiesel. After the reaction and separation, 1.5 mL of
product sample was taken and the amount of biodiesel (g) was determined.
Finally, isolated yield is the ratio of the biodiesel produced (g)
to the theoretically possible biodiesel production (g). In this section,
intensification of BBAIL-catalyzed biodiesel synthesize using ultrasonication
is explained in detail. Also, the influence of various reaction variables
in the presence of ultrasonication is discussed meticulously.

3.1 Influence of Ultrasonication
Controlled
sonication is desired for best results41 as excessive cavitation may be harmful; on the other hand, less
cavitation is useless. Important parameters in sonication will be
sonication cycle, amplitude, and frequency. Increased formation of
cavitation bubbles takes place as the ultrasonication power increases.
Safari and Javadian43 reported that an
increase in ultrasonication power up to 160 W (found to be optimum)
resulted in a higher yield of biodiesel in shorter time, whereas an
increase beyond 160 W resulted in a small reduction in yield. Duty
cycle decides the exposure time of irradiation in one cycle. Optimal
duty cycle is required for maximizing the yield. In this study, amplitude
(varied from 40 to 100%), duty cycle, i.e., on–off time (several
combinations), and size of ultrasonicator probe (12 and 24 mm) were
varied to investigate their effect on biodiesel yield. Experiments
were conducted to find the optimum ultrasonication. Better biodiesel
yield, i.e., 91%, was obtained in 2 h when 70% amplitude, 50–20
s on–off time, and 12 mm ultrasonicator probe were used at
45 °C temperature, 1:12 oil-to-MA ratio, and 5 mol % catalyst.

Cavitation, i.e., bubble formation, occurs in the oil phase as
well as in the MA phase. More evaporation of MA molecules occurs inside
the bubble as MA has higher vapor pressure than oil. Ultrasonication
was found to be useful, and it was observed that the ultrasonication
reduced the reaction time significantly, as discussed in Section 3.2. It is interesting
to know if the enhancement due to the ultrasonication is due to the
physical effects or chemical effects. As acid-functionalized IL catalyst
(i.e., BBAIL) is used in this study, direct protonation of triglycerides
by acid catalyst takes place, which initiates the reaction. This is
different from the mechanism using any base catalyst where alkoxide
anions are generated.42 The results presented
in the following subsections show that there is possible enhancement
of interaction between proton generated by BBAIL catalyst and the
triglyceride, thereby improving the mass transfer. The significant
influence of reaction temperature, catalyst dose, and oil-to-MA ratio
on biodiesel synthesis, as explained below, shows that the intrinsic
kinetics of the transesterification reaction is a dominant factor,
which hints the sonophysical effects of ultrasonication. The physical
effect of ultrasonication is through strong microconvection that results
in the improvements in the mass transfer of the system. Similar findings
were reported in Moholkar et al.42

3.2 Influence of Reaction Time
Figure 3 presents the influence
of time on the biodiesel synthesis from castor oil. Reaction time
is one of important factors used to obtain maximum yield. It was seen
that the biodiesel yield improved with time up to 90 min, after which
it was constant up to 120 min at the given conditions.

Figure 3 Influence of reaction
time (min) on isolated yield (conditions:
45 °C temperature, 5 mol % catalyst, 1:12 oil-to-MA molar ratio).

Hence, 90 min was considered to
be the optimum reaction time and
further analysis were performed for 90 min. A reaction time of 90
min under ultrasonication is significantly shorter compared to the
case without ultrasonication, where 14 h was required to complete
the reaction under the same conditions. Shorter reaction time is desired
as it implies lower reactor volume, i.e., smaller footprint, and hence
smaller investment.

3.3 Influence of the Catalyst
BBAIL catalyst
amount was varied up to 10 mol % to examine its effect on biodiesel
yield. The results clearly show that the reaction kinetics for the
conversion of castor oil to biodiesel was considerably enhanced by
the catalyst amount. Biodiesel yield was found to be enhanced with
catalyst amount up to 9 mol %. This is attributed to the increase
in the acidic sites promoting the protonation of triglycerides by
BBAIL acid catalyst. The highest biodiesel yield of 95% was achieved
at 9 mol % catalyst (see Figure 4) when 1:12 oil-to-MA molar ratio and 45 °C temperature
were maintained. Further increase in the catalyst amount did not improve
the yield of the reaction, as it can be seen from Figure 4. This is attributed to the
increased viscosity of the solution, resulting in the reduced interaction
between the BBAIL and the reactants.

Figure 4 Influence of catalyst dose (mol %) on
isolated yield (conditions:
45 °C temperature; 1:12 oil-to-MA molar ratio; and 90 min time).

3.4 Influence
of Temperature
The oil
bath temperature was varied from room temperature, i.e., 28 to 50
°C to examine its influence on the reaction. Temperature was
found to have a considerable effect on enhancing the yield of the
reaction. In the present study, the yield of biodiesel increased from
90 to 96% as the oil bath temperature was increased from 35 to 50
°C in 90 min, whereas there was no change in the yield from room
temperature to 35 °C, as depicted in Figure 5. The increased yield at increased temperature
was due to the more energy provided to the reactants at higher temperature
to overcome the activation energy. It is important to note that by
the virtue of ultrasonication, the temperature of reaction mixture
increased to about 40 °C. Therefore, even without heating the
reaction mixture, i.e., oil bath, at room temperature, the yield was
90%. However, further increase in temperature up to 60 °C resulted
in a slight reduction of the yield. This small reduction is potentially
due to the vaporization of MA at higher temperature and decrease in
the ultrasonic effect. With increasing temperature up to some limit,
the yield was enhanced due to the enhanced solubility of MA in the
oil phase. On the other hand, further increase in temperature may
reduce the ultrasonic effect, thereby retarding the cavitational effects.

Figure 5 Effect
of temperature (°C) on isolated yield (conditions:
9 mol % catalyst; 1:12 oil-to-MA molar ratio; and 90 min time).

3.5 Influence
of Castor Oil-to-MA Molar Ratio
MA requires to be used well
above the stoichiometric proportion
of 1:3 oil-to-glycerides molar ratio as the reaction presents mass
transfer limitation, especially when acid catalyst is used. A higher
molar ratio is required to drive the reaction in forward direction,
i.e., toward the product side. However, the use of more MA increases
the cost of its separation after the reaction; hence, it is crucial
to find the optimum MA requirement. In this study, oil-to-MA molar
ratio was reduced from 1:12 (i.e., the optimum found in a previous
study40) to 1:8 to investigate its influence
on the biodiesel yield. It was found that the yield remained nearly
the same at the 1:10 oil-to-MA molar ratio (Figure 6), after which the yield reduced. Therefore,
the oil-to-MA molar ratio of 1:10 was considered optimum. This confirms
another benefit of ultrasonication in addition to the significant
reduction of reaction time from 14 h to 90 min. An oil-to-MA molar
ratio above 1:10 did not result in any enhancement in the yield.

Figure 6 Influence
of oil-to-MA molar ratio on isolated yield (conditions:
45 °C temperature; 9 mol % catalyst; and 90 min reaction time).

This may be due to the fact that
with the increase of MA, the concentration
of acid catalyst reduced, thereby reducing the possibility of the
interaction between proton and glycerides. It is inferred that due
to stronger microturbulence and acoustic microstreaming in MA resulting
from ultrasonication, the dispersion of MA in oil is better, which
results in better interaction at this molar ratio.

The formation
of biodiesel from castor oil through transesterification
was established by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra,
which are depicted in Figures 7 and 8. The 1H NMR spectrum
(in Figure 7) shows
the generation of a new peak at 3.6 ppm. This peak is attributed to
“–CH3” of the methyl ricinoleate,
i.e., biodiesel. This is also reestablished by the 13C
NMR spectrum depicted in Figure 8. Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information shows the FT-IR spectra of castor oil.

of the produced biodiesel.

Scheme 2 shows the
plausible mechanism for the conversion of glycerides with MA using
BBAIL catalyst. A detailed explanation of this mechanism can be found
in our earlier article.40

of the Castor Oil Transesterification with MA and BBAIL40
3.6 Recyclability of the BBAIL
It is
pertinent to investigate the reusability of the BBAIL catalyst as
the catalyst may have a considerable impact on the overall cost of
production. BBAIL catalyst was recovered based on the procedure explained
in Section 2.4. The
reusability of the BBAIL catalyst was then investigated by carrying
out another run to synthesize the biodiesel using recycled catalyst.
It was found that the catalyst could be reused with a small loss of
yield up to 3 runs (Figure 9). Easy recovery of BBAIL catalyst is attractive as it can
later be reused for successive runs. A comparison of the current study
with some of the recent studies44−46 reveals that the use of ultrasonication
with BBAIL catalyst for the transesterification of castor oil is promising
as it requires just about 4 wt % (i.e., 9 mol %) of BBAIL catalyst
to synthesize biodiesel with 96% yield in just 90 min. Rengasamy et
al.44 reported the use of 1 wt % Bio-FeNPs
catalyst to obtain 85.2% yield. Negm et al.45 used 5 wt % Si-Mica-Ph-SO3H catalyst to obtain 90% yield.
Baskar et al.46 reported 96.5% yield using
11 wt % Ni-doped ZnO nanocatalyst.

Figure 9 Reusability of BBAIL catalyst at 50 °C.

Finally, the practicability of
the produced biodiesel was confirmed
by determining the properties of 10, 20, and 30% methyl ricinoleate
blend (on volume) with real petro-diesel (Table 1). It was observed that the blends secured
similar properties to those of petro-diesel. Kinematic viscosity at
40 °C and density of the blended samples increased with more
blending. Nevertheless, the density was found to be within the acceptable
range of 0.86–0.90 g/cm3 (according to ASTM standards)
for all of the tested blends, i.e., 10, 20, and 30%. However, the
viscosity was found to increase more and was more than the acceptable
limit for 20 and 30% blends. However, it remained within the acceptable
range for 10% biodiesel blend. Increased viscosity is both advantageous
and disadvantageous as increased viscosity makes the transportation
of the biodiesel easy; however, it may lead to incomplete combustion.
Considering these, biodiesel produced from castor oil should not be
blended in higher proportions.

Calorific values for all blends were
comparable to those of pure
petro-diesel. In contrast, fire point and flash point were improved
as biodiesel blend was increased. However, cetane number decreased
as blending percentage was increased, which limits the extent of blending
in real application. The test outcomes are shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Biodiesel blended
with petro-diesel is attractive as it has a more favorable combustion
emission profile than its counterpart, i.e., petro-diesel, such as
less emission of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and unburned
hydrocarbons.47

3.7 Industrial
Scale Operability of Ultrasonication
Industrial scale operation
of ultrasonic-assisted reactors is much
challenging than the lab-scale processing. Ultrasonic processing at
industrial level requires high-capacity industrial ultrasonic processor(s)
due to the increased power requirement resulting from the greater
volume or flow to be processed. Continuous full-scale processes will
invariably require fully reliable, energy-efficient, high-power generating,
and compact instrument(s). One of the major concerns regarding the
use of ultrasonication is the requirement of the high power, which
demands high energy. Hence, it is vital that the ultrasonic instruments
convert the electrical energy into mechanical vibrations without wasting
the energy. Also, they should be able to run for a long time continuously
at a high load in the industrial environment such as in the presence
of dust, sprayed liquids, unsophisticated handling, etc. According
to ref (49), ultrasonic
reactors are recommended for production capacities of 0.25 ton/h (i.e.,
80 gal/h) or higher. Generally, multiple units in parallel may have
to operate to accommodate the variations in production rates.

4 Conclusions
This work discussed the acoustic effects
of ultrasonication in
conjunction with the influence of the BBAIL catalyst on the transesterification
reaction. Ultrasonication was proved to be an effective technique
to reduce the reaction time significantly, i.e., from 14 h to 90 min,
for the conversion of castor oil to much desired biodiesel. Maximum
biodiesel yield, i.e., 96%, was achieved at 1:10 molar ratio of castor
oil to MA, 50 °C temperature, and 9 mol % catalyst (i.e., ∼4
wt %) in 90 min in the presence of ultrasonication, whereas the highest
yield was achieved at 1:12 molar ratio of castor oil to MA, 40 °C
temperature, and 5 mol % catalyst in 14 h without ultrasonication.
In addition, the catalyst could be effectively recycled three times
with a small reduction in its activity. Finally, the properties of
the 10, 20, and 30% biodiesel blends were tested and successfully
compared to the properties of petro-diesel to validate the potential
application of the synthesized biodiesel as a potential biofuel. To
conclude, the outcomes, i.e., high biodiesel yield in reduced time,
of the study are due to the combined effects of ultrasonication and
BBAIL catalyst.
