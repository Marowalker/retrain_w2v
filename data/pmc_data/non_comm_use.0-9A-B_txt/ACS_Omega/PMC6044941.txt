Trialkylphosphines
tris(2-carboxy-ethyl)-phosphine and tris(3-hydroxypropyl)-phosphine
are popular reagents for the reduction of cysteine residues in bioconjugation
reactions using maleimides. However, it has been demonstrated that
these phosphines are reactive toward maleimide, necessitating their
removal before the addition of the Michael acceptor. Here, a method
using water-soluble PEG-azides is reported for the quenching of trialkylphosphines
in situ, which is demonstrated to improve the level of maleimide conjugation
to proteins.

Introduction
The water-soluble trialkylphosphines,
tris(2-carboxy-ethyl)-phosphine 1 (TCEP) and tris(3-hydroxypropyl)-phosphine 2 (THPP), are effective reagents for the reduction of disulfides
before
performing protein-conjugation reactions using Michael acceptors such
as maleimides (Figure 1a).1−5 Reactions such as these are important within the pharmaceutical
industry for the manufacture of several types of products including
antibody–drug conjugates, PEGylated proteins, and conjugate
vaccines. Preference for the use of TCEP and THPP over traditional
thiol-based reducing agents can be attributed to a number of practical
advantages. TCEP and THPP are relatively stable toward aerial oxidation
at pH values common for protein conjugations, as well as being nonvolatile
and relatively odorless.6,7 Importantly, reduction
of cysteinyl residues by these phosphines does not result in the formation
of mixed disulfides, as is the case with traditional thiols such as
dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol.7−10

respectively.16 (c) Oxidation of TCEP using

Early reports on the use of TCEP in protein conjugation strategies
suggested that this phosphine was compatible with maleimide and did
not need to be removed before the addition of the Michael acceptor.2,11−13 A number of recent reports, however, have confirmed
that TCEP and THPP do indeed react with maleimides to reduce conjugation
yields significantly.8,14−17 Importantly, it has also been
demonstrated that ylenes formed between maleimide and TCEP, such as 3, are remarkably stable under physiological conditions and
can remain incorporated in the products of some protein conjugations
(Figure 1b).16 As such, it is advantageous to remove the phosphine
from the reaction before the addition of maleimide.

A variety
of methods are available for the removal of TCEP (e.g.,
dialysis, TCEP-immobilized resin, column chromatography); however,
each has associated drawbacks.14 As an
alternative, Henkel et al. have reported an elegant approach that
uses 4-azidobenzoic acid (4-ABA) 4 to quench excess TCEP
through a Staudinger reaction, thus circumventing the need for a purification
step when using phosphines in maleimide-based bioconjugations (Figure 1c).17

In our hands, however, we have found the application
of this method
to be limited by the low aqueous solubility of 4, which
necessitated increased reaction volumes, thereby reducing the substrate
concentrations and reaction rates. Here, we describe the use of azide-modified
polyethylene glycols as water-soluble reagents for the quenching of
TCEP and THPP in situ to improve yields of protein conjugation reactions
using maleimide.

Results and Discussion
A series
of azide-containing ethylene glycols of increasing molecular
weights were initially chosen to determine the effect of polymer length
on their aqueous solubility and on reactivity toward TCEP. Diazido-ethylene
glycols 5–8 are all available commercially
or, alternatively, can each be synthesized in good yields following
established methods (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Chemical Synthesis of PEG-Azides 5–8
The mass and molar
solubilities of PEG-azides 5–8 were
determined in a 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer at pH
7, and all azides were found to be readily soluble in this buffer
system with values ranging from 25 mg/mL for the di-PEG 5, up to 130 mg/mL for the penta-PEG 8 (Table 1). By comparison, 4-ABA (4) was found to have a significantly lower mass solubility
under similar conditions (Table 1). The solubility of 4 could be increased
using different solvent systems, such as 50% aqueous methanol or Tris–HCl
buffer at pH 8.0. However, solvent systems such as these are suboptimal
for performing maleimide conjugation reactions with proteins.

The ability of azides 5–8 to quench
TCEP and THPP by promoting oxidation was then evaluated using 31P NMR spectroscopy to quantify the rate of consumption of
phosphine. Solutions of TCEP (25 mM) and PEG-azide (10 equiv) were
monitored every 10 min (31P NMR), with all azides promoting
rapid oxidation of TCEP. Azides 5–7 were found to have similar reactivities, with complete consumption
of TCEP occurring after 50–60 min (Figure 2). The penta-PEG azide, 8, was
found to react slightly more rapidly, with complete oxidation of the
phosphine occurring after only 40 min. Similarly, all of the azides
(5–8) were found to promote the oxidation
of THPP under similar conditions to those used for the oxidation of
TCEP; however, oxidation occurred at much higher rates and complete
consumption of THPP was observed in less than 5 min.

Remaining TCEP (%) was determined using 31P NMR spectroscopy.

Having established that all of
the PEG-azides, 5–8, can effectively
promote rapid oxidation of TCEP and THPP
under conditions suitable for performing maleimide-based protein conjugation
reactions, it was necessary to consider potential side reactions that
might occur from their use in situ in a conjugation mixture. In particular,
the ability of alkyl azides to react with maleimide to form triazoles
is reported in the literature, typically using organic solvents at
elevated temperatures.18 To investigate
the potential for PEG-azides to form triazoles with maleimide in an
aqueous buffer at an ambient temperature, the tetra-PEG azide, 7, was treated with N-ethylmaleimide (9) for 2.5 days, which resulted in the formation of both the
monotriazole (10) and ditriazole (11) derivatives
isolated in 42 and 25% yields, respectively (Scheme 2). Despite this observation, it was considered
that the cross-reaction with maleimide was unlikely to interfere with
the use of PEG-azides in situ during protein conjugation strategies
given the very slow rate of triazole formation (days) compared to
typical rates of maleimide reaction with thiols (min–h).

Scheme 2 Reaction of PEG-Azide 7 with N-Ethylmaleimide 9 (1.5 equiv) To Give Monotriazole 10 and Ditriazole 11, in 42 and 25% Yields, Respectively
The use of PEG-azides to improve the yield of
bioconjugation reactions
was then evaluated in applications in which maleimide is commonly
employed as a Michael acceptor. The functionalization of proteins
using maleimide-derivatized fluorescent labels is often used to enable
visualization of proteins, with a number of these reagents, for example, N-(5-fluorescinyl)maleimide (12), being commercially
available (Figure 3a).15,19,20 Tyagarajan
et al. have demonstrated previously that the level of labeling of
yeast enolase protein (which contains a single internal cysteine and
requires denaturation for conjugation to occur) by maleimide-containing
fluorescent dyes is significantly diminished when performing the conjugation
reaction in the presence of TCEP.15 We
sought to evaluate the impact that the use of PEG-azides in situ would
have on the level of fluorescent labeling of yeast enolase using 12. Denatured yeast enolase was treated with varying amounts
of TCEP (1, 5, or 10 equiv) and then incubated with 12. In a parallel experiment, TCEP-treated enolase samples were incubated
with PEG-azide 7 for 1 h before the addition of compound 12. The fluorescently labeled enolase protein was then resolved
using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE),
and the level of maleimide conjugation was evaluated by visualization
at 525 nm (Dark Reader). Here, the degree of fluorescent labeling
of yeast enolase was observed to decrease with increasing amounts
of TCEP (Figure 3b,
lanes 1–3), consistent with the previous observations of Tyagarajan
et al. Significantly, in the presence of both 5 and 10 equiv of TCEP
(Figure 3b, lanes 2
and 3, respectively), labeling by maleimide was essentially abolished.
However, for enolase samples treated with PEG-azide 7 before the addition of 12, there appeared to be little
difference between the amount of TCEP used and the extent of fluorescent
labeling, with all samples showing significant levels of fluorescence
(Figure 3b, lanes 4–6).
Similarly, when the above experiment was repeated using THPP as the
reducing agent, fluorescent labeling was again seen to decrease significantly
with increasing amounts of the phosphine in the absence of azide 7 (Figure 3c, lanes 1–3). In the presence of azide 7, however,
the amount of THPP used did not appear to influence the extent of
conjugation (Figure 3c, lanes 4–6), consistent with the results observed for TCEP-treated
enolase. As such, the preincubation of TCEP- or THPP-treated enolase
with PEG-azide 7 before maleimide addition was found
to improve the level of fluorescent conjugation regardless of the
amount of the phosphine used.

in Tris–HCl buffer (0.5 M, pH 7.2, 5 mM EDTA) was incubated

1 h (37 °C) before the addition of 12 (1 mM) for
18 h (37 °C). All protein samples were resolved by SDS-Page (4–12%
gradient gel) and fluorescence visualized at 525 nm (Dark Reader).

Another important application
of maleimide for conjugation to proteins
involves the attachment of large PEG polymers (kDa’s), a technique
used widely within the pharmaceutical industry to improve the pharmacokinetic
properties of protein therapeutics. Here, it was considered that investigating
the use of azides 5–8 in situ in
protein PEGylation reactions would also facilitate the quantification
of any improvements to conjugation, as PEGylated protein products
could be resolved on the basis of their mass (SDS-PAGE). In addition,
the use of excess PEG-maleimide to protein (100 equiv) would identify
whether any nonspecific conjugation was occurring, as multiple higher-molecular-weight
products would be observed. Denatured yeast enolase protein was reduced
with varying amounts of TCEP (1, 5, and 10 equiv) and then incubated
with 2 kDa PEG-maleimide. In parallel, samples of the TCEP-reduced
enolase were treated with azide 7 for 1 h, before incubation
with 2 kDa PEG-maleimide under similar conditions. All samples were
then resolved (SDS-PAGE), and the presence of protein was detected
by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To determine the level
of protein PEGylation, SDS gels were scanned (LI-COR Odyssey CLx)
to quantify the intensity of Coomassie-stained protein bands. Figure 4a shows that the
extent of protein PEGylation decreases significantly from 42 to 11%
with increasing amounts of TCEP when treated with 2 kDa PEG-maleimide
directly following reduction (lanes 3–5). In contrast, for
enolase incubated with azide 7 before incubation with
2 kDa PEG-maleimide, increased levels of PEGylation were observed
for all samples (76–85%), regardless of the TCEP concentration
used (Figure 4a, lanes
6–8). Worthy of mention is that, in the presence of equal molar
amounts of maleimide to TCEP, only 42% conjugation is observed following
direct treatment with PEG-maleimide (lane 3), whereas the level of
conjugation rises to 76% following removal of TCEP by 7 before the addition of maleimide (lane 6). This suggests that the
relative rates of reaction between maleimide with either cysteine
or TCEP are comparable, consistent with previous observations by Kantner.16 Similar results were also observed using THPP
as the reducing agent. Treatment of denatured enolase with 2 kDa PEG-maleimide
immediately following reduction showed significant levels of unmodified
protein (Figure 4b,
lanes 3–5), whereas incubation of the reduced protein with 7 before the addition of maleimide resulted in high levels
of PEGylation for all concentrations of THPP used (Figure 4b, lanes 6–8). Interestingly,
the highest overall levels of protein PEGylation were observed using
a 10:1 ratio of the phosphine (TCEP or THPP) when incubated with 7 before the addition of maleimide (Figure 4a, lane 8; and Figure 4b, lane 8). Conversely, the poorest levels
of conjugation were seen when using this same 10:1 ratio of the phosphine
in the absence of 7 (Figure 4a, lane 3; and Figure 4b, lane 3). This observation could result
from more extensive reduction (more thiol present) as a consequence
of the ability to use higher TCEP concentrations, given that all excess
TCEP is now being removed through the use of PEG-azides.

(4–12% gradient gel) and stained using Coomassie blue solution.
PEGylated enolase (%) was determined by scanning each band (n = 3) using a LI-COR Odyssey CLx and calculating the ratio
of PEGylated enolase/total enolase (Image Studio Lite).

Conclusions
In summary, we have
shown here that PEG-azides 5–8 have
suitable aqueous solubilities to enable their use in
bioconjugation strategies employing maleimide and that all of these
azides affect the rapid oxidation of both TCEP and THPP. Furthermore,
it has been observed that the treatment of phosphine-reduced protein
with PEG-azides such as 7 in situ, before the addition
of the maleimide, allows for the use of high TCEP concentrations and
leads to improved levels of conjugation using both small fluorescent
probes and higher-molecular-weight PEGs.

was allowed to stir at 37 °C overnight. The mixture was then
concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the acetone, and the
product was extracted using ethyl acetate (3 × 20 mL). The organic
extract was then washed with saturated brine solution, dried over
MgSO4, concentrated, and then purified by silica gel chromatography
(10 → 60% EtOAc/petroleum ether) to give the diazide (8) as a colorless oil (0.89 g, 79%). NMR spectra were consistent
with those reported.211H NMR

Rates of TCEP Oxidation by PEG-Azides (5–8)
Control
The rate
of background (aerial) oxidation of
TCEP was initially evaluated. A solution of TCEP (100 mM) in Tris–HCl
buffer (0.1 M, pH 7) was held at 37 °C, and the mixture was analyzed
at 3 and 63 min using 31P NMR spectroscopy to quantify
the levels of phosphine oxide present. No oxidation of TCEP was observed
under these conditions (Figure S1).

PEG-Azide-Promoted
Oxidation of TCEP
A solution of
TCEP–HCl (14 mg, 50 μmol) and PEG-azide (500 μmol,
10 equiv) in 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer (2 mL, pH 7) was held at
37 °C, and the solution was analyzed by 31P NMR spectroscopy
at times 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, and 63 min. The level of TCEP oxidation
was calculated by comparison of integrals corresponding to the phosphine
and phosphine oxide. It should be noted that PEG-azide 5 was only partially soluble under these conditions.

PEG-Azide-Promoted
Oxidation of THPP
A solution of
THPP (10 mg, 48 μmol) and PEG-azide 8 (40 mg, 120
μmol, 2.5 equiv) in 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer (2 mL, pH 7)
was held at 37 °C, and the solution was analyzed by 31P NMR spectroscopy at time 3 min. Complete conversion to the phosphine
oxide was observed at this time as no signal corresponding to the
remaining phosphine was present.

Fluorescent Labeling of
Yeast Enolase in the Absence/Presence
of PEG-Azide (7)
Denaturation of Yeast Enolase Protein
A solution of
yeast enolase (1 mg/mL) in deoxygenated Tris–HCl buffer (0.5
M, pH 7.2, 5 mM EDTA) containing 8 M urea was heated to 85 °C
and held at this temperature for 15 min. The solution was allowed
to cool to room temperature before use in subsequent experiments.

Labeling of Yeast Enolase with Maleimide Fluorescein (11) Following Reduction with TCEP or THPP
Aliquots
(100 μL) of denatured yeast enolase (1 mg/mL, 11 μM) were
treated with varying concentrations of TCEP or THPP (1–10 mM)
and incubated for 45 min at 25 °C. Maleimide fluorescein 11 (1 mM) was subsequently added to the enolase solutions
at each phosphine concentration and incubated at 37 °C for 18
h. Samples (15 μL) were taken from each of the reactions and
added to the Laemmli sample buffer (15 μL) and heated (85 °C,
8 min). Aliquots (9 μL) of these solutions were then loaded
into a precast gradient gel (4–12% Bis-Tris, Invitrogen) along
with a protein ladder (EZ-Run, Fisher Scientific) and resolved by
SDS Page electrophoresis [MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen), 180 V,
60 min]. The precast gels were first stained by Coomassie solution
and destained using a water/ethanol/acetic acid (16:3:1) solution
to confirm equal protein loading. Fluorescence was then visualized
at 525 nm (Dark Reader).

Labeling of Yeast Enolase with Maleimide
Fluorescein (11) Following Quenching of TCEP or THPP
with PEG-Azide (7)
Aliquots (100 μL) of
denatured yeast enolase
(1 mg/mL, 11 μM) were treated with varying concentrations of
TCEP or THPP (1–10 mM) and incubated for 45 min at 25 °C.
Samples were then treated with PEG-azide 7 (100 mM) and
held for 1 hour at 37 °C. Maleimide-fluorescein (1 mM) was subsequently
added to these solutions and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Samples
(15 μL) were taken from each of the reactions and added to the
Laemmli sample buffer (15 μL) and heated (85 °C, 8 min).
Aliquots (9 μL) of these solutions were loaded into a precast
gradient gel (4–12% Bis-Tris, Invitrogen) along with a protein
ladder (EZ-Run, Fisher Scientific) and resolved by SDS Page electrophoresis
[MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen), 180 V, 60 min]. The precast gels
were stained by the Coomassie solution and destained using a water/ethanol/acetic

(7) Following Reduction by TCEP or THPP
Labeling
of Yeast Enolase with 2 kDa-PEG Maleimide Following
Reduction with TCEP or THPP
Aliquots (100 μL) of denatured
yeast enolase (1 mg/mL, 11 μM) were treated with varying concentrations
of TCEP or THPP (1–10 mM) and incubated for 45 min at 25 °C.
2 kDa-PEG maleimide (1 mM) was subsequently added to the enolase solutions
at each phosphine concentration and incubated at 37 °C for 18

The precast gels were stained by the Coomassie solution and destained
using a water/ethanol/acetic acid (16:3:1) solution. The gel was then
scanned using a LI-COR Odyssey CLx to quantify PEGylated enolase (Image
Studio Lite).

Maleimide Following
Quenching of TCEP or THPP with PEG-Azide (7)
Aliquots (100 μL) of denatured yeast enolase (1 mg/mL, 11 μM)
were treated with varying concentrations of TCEP or THPP (1–10
mM) and incubated for 45 min at 25 °C. Samples were then treated
with PEG-azide 7 (100 mM) and held for 1 hour at 37 °C.
2 kDa-PEG maleimide (1 mM) was subsequently added to these solutions
and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Samples (15 μL) were taken
