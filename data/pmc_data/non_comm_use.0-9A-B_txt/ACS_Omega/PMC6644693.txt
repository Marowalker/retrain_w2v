Multistep reactions are often required
for the transformation of
alcohols to α-chloroacetals via the unstable intermediates aldehydes
or α-halo aldehydes. Herein, we report a simplified procedure
for practical synthesis of α-chloroacetals using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl
as a catalyst and trichloroisocyanuric acid both as an oxidant and
a chlorination reagent. The reaction is one-pot, solvent-free and
high-yielding. In addition, the α-chloroacetals have been transformed
to enol ethers through the elimination reaction in the presence of
sodium.

Introduction
α-Chloroacetals
act as significant intermediates in organic
synthetic reactions and exhibit various bioactivities.1−4 In general, these compounds are prepared starting with alcohols
by oxidation and subsequent α-halogenation in a two- or three-step
sequence, in which the intermediates aldehydes, α-chloroaldehydes,
or acetals are involved. For example, Ghelfi’s group has reported
the synthesis of α-chloroacetals through the chlorination of
acetals derived from aldehydes and alcohols by MnO2-trimethylchlorosilane.5 In terms of process economy, one-pot oxidation
with subsequent α-chlorination and acetalation is highly desirable,
Nikishin’s group has reported the synthesis of α-chloroacetals
through the oxidation of primary alkyl alcohols by Na2S2O8 in conjunction with an alkali metal chloride
as a chlorination reagent in relatively low yields of 20–40%.6 However, all these reactions employed volatile
organic solvents as reaction media.

Volatile organic solvents
are consumed in large amounts in manufacturing
of drugs, pesticides, dyes, and materials. In pharmaceutical industry
alone, the cost of organic solvents has been estimated at four billion
pounds annually.7 Because of the difficulties
in 100% recovery of the volatile organic solvents, they have been
one of the culprits for air pollution. There are various ways solving
these problems. Our group has initiated the water/granular polytetrafluoroethylene
methods conducting a series of organic reactions without using volatile
organic solvents.8−11 In addition, large numbers of solvent-free organic synthesis reactions
have been reported.12−14

Herein, we report the direct oxidation of primary
alcohols in one
pot to α-chloroacetals catalyzed by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl
(TEMPO) with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) as an oxidation and
a chlorination reagent under solvent-free conditions in the yields
of 61–90%. TCCA is a commercially available and very cheap
oxidant.15−17 The combination of TEMPO and TCCA has been used catalytically
and stoichiometrically for the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes,18 α-chloroaldehydes,19 carboxylic acids,20 esters,21 and so on.

Results and Discussion
At the beginning of our study, we chose n-octanol
(1) as the model substrate to optimize the reaction conditions
(Table 1). Mixtures
of n-octanol (1, 2.0 mmol, 260 mg),
TEMPO, and TCCA in various ratios were stirred under solvent-free
conditions at room temperature in air atmosphere. First, the amount
of TEMPO was investigated. When the amount of TEMPO was 0.01 equiv,
product 1a was obtained in a 25% yield (Table 1, entry 1). Along with the increasing
amount of TEMPO from 0.01 to 0.10 equiv, the yields increased from
25 to 56% (Table 1,
entries 1–5). Further increasing the amount of TEMPO to 0.15
equiv resulted in a lower yield of 1a (Table 1, entry 6). Then, the amount
of TCCA was screened. When the amount of TCCA was reduced to 0.3 equiv,
the conversion of this reaction was 84% with a 59% yield (Table 1, entry 7). With 0.5
equiv of TCCA, the conversion was 95% with the highest yield of 81%,
and the reaction time increased from 2.0 to 3.0 h (Table 1, entry 8). Then, the yield
decreased from 81 to 29% with further increasing amount of TCCA from
0.5 to 1.5 equiv (Table 1, entries 5 and 8–10). On the basis of these results, the
optimized conditions were n-octanol (1, 2.0 mmol), TEMPO (0.10 equiv), and TCCA (0.5 equiv) at room temperature
in air atmosphere (Table 1, entry 8).

yields.

Under the optimized
reaction conditions, we sought to examine the
scope and generality of this method. This method is applicable to
a range of primary alcohols. As shown in Scheme 1, initially eight simple primary alcohols
have been chosen (Scheme 1, 1a–1h), the yields ranged
from 61 to 89% while the reaction times from 3 to 24 h. Both the yields
and reaction rates decreased with the increase of the molecular weight
of the alcohols (Scheme 1, 1a vs 1b vs 1c vs 1d vs 1e vs 1f). The fastest reaction
rate and the highest yield was observed for the synthesis of 1b while the slowest reaction rate was observed for the formation
of 1f, probably because of the better solubility of TEMPO
and TCCA in n-hexanol than in n-octadecanol.
In addition, under the solvent-free conditions, the higher molar concentration
of n-hexanol than n-octadecanol
is another possible reason for the higher reaction rate in n-hexanol. Furthermore, at room temperature, n-hexadecanol and n-octadecanol are solid, so heating
is necessary in the synthesis of 1e and 1f. Then, this method was further applied to primary alcohols containing
heteroatoms or aryl groups (Scheme 1, 1i–1m). The alcohols
possessing heteroatoms such as Cl, Br gave α-chloroacetals in
excellent yields (90 and 84%; Scheme 1, 1i and 1j). Substrates
with aryl groups also gave the products in moderate yields (Scheme 1, 1k–1m). Furthermore, the hindered primary alcohols
yielded the products in high yields of 75–86% (Scheme 1, 1n–1p).

Scheme 1 Solvent-Free Direct Conversion of Primary Alcohols
to α-Chloroacetals,
Reaction conditions: alcohols
(2 mmol), TEMPO (0.1 equiv), TCCA (0.5 equiv) under solvent-free condition.

All yields are isolated yields

In the second stage of the research, the α-chloroacetals
were successfully transformed into enol ethers in the presence of
sodium (Scheme 2).
In the literature, there have been various methods22 for preparing enol ethers such as vinyl transfer to alcohols,23 reduction of vinyl phosphate ethers,24 functionalization of vinyl ethers,25 and so on. A method closely related to this
work is the reaction between 3-chloro-2-methoxytetrahydropyran with
sodium to yield chain enol ether with hydroxyl group.26 However, the starting material 3-chloro-2-methoxytetrahydropyran
was synthesized from enol ether dihydropyran27 or from 1,2-dichlorotetrahydropyran.28 The starting materials are not as readily available and inexpensive
as the primary alcohols used in this work. As shown in Scheme 2, α-chloroacetals 1b, 1c, 1d, and 1i were
treated with sodium to produce enol ethers 2a–2d in good yields and at moderate reaction rates.

conditions: α-chloroacetals
(1 mmol), sodium (2 equiv), refluxed in 1,4-dioxane (5 mL) at 100
°C under nitrogen.

All yields are isolated yields

To gain insights
into the mechanism in the synthesis of α-chloroacetals,
several control experiments were carried out (Scheme 3). In the synthesis of 1a, 0.1
equiv of n-decanal (3) was added to
the reaction mixture, not only product 1a was observed
in the products but also product 3a was generated (Scheme 3, reaction 1). This
reaction indicated that maybe aldehydes are the reaction intermediates.
Similarly, in the synthesis of 1a, 0.1 equiv of α-chlorodecanal
(4) was added, product 3a was generated
which indicated that maybe α-chloroaldehydes are the reaction
intermediates (Scheme 3, reaction 2). Subsequently, under the optimized reaction conditions,
using acetal 5 as the starting material, no reaction
occurred, excluding acetals as the reaction intermediates (Scheme 3, reaction 3).

Scheme 3 Mechanism Studies for the Synthesis of α-Chloroacetals
On the basis of the control
experiments and according to that reported
for similar cases,18−21 the probable reaction pathway is put forward, as shown in Scheme 4. First, TCCA reacts
with TEMPO to form N-oxoammonium ion I, which oxidizes the primary alcohol through intermediate II to the corresponding aldehyde IV, giving hydroxylamine III. Then, intermediate III is in turn oxidized
to I by TCCA. In the meantime, aldehyde IV is turned into enol V through a keto enol tautomerism
equilibrium which reacts with the chloronium ion from TCCA, giving VI. Then, intermediate VI reacts with the primary
alcohol to give final α-chloroacetal IX.

Pathway for the Synthesis of α-Chloroacetals
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have
for the first time realizing the oxidation
and chlorination in one pot for the synthesis of α-chloroacetals
from alcohols under solvent-free conditions using the combination
of TEMPO and TCCA. In comparison to all methods documented in the
literature, this method offered several advantages including readily
available starting materials and reagents, solvent-free conditions.
In addition, we have realized the transformation of α-chloroacetals
to enol ethers in presence of sodium which provides a simple method
for the synthesis of enol ethers.
