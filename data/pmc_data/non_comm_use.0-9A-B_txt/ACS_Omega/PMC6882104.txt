Photoisomerization
of Irgacure PAG 103 followed by photocyclization
and fragmentation leads to three tricyclic thieno[2,3-b]quinoline-4-carbonitrile heterocyclic compounds. The release of
acid which can catalyze polymer resist modifications is indicated
by the low pH of an aqueous extract. These reactions are discussed
in view of possible mechanisms and how these might influence future
design strategies.

Introduction
The concept of chemical
amplification in thin polymer film resists
was proposed by Ito, Willson, and Fréchet in 1982.1,2 Chemical amplification allows a single photochemical reaction to
induce a cascade of transformations in a resist film which modify
its properties during a postexposure bake.3−5 Photoacid generators
(PAGs), which release catalytic quantities of acid upon irradiation
through a mask, have become a new family of modern polymer resist.
Various PAGs have been synthesized for use in chemical amplification
resists.6,7 They can be divided into two main types,
ionic and nonionic. Ionic or onium salt acid generators such as triarylsulfonium
and diaryliodonium salts were originally developed by Crivello for
curing epoxy resins.8−15 Upon irradiation, they liberate strong acids with good quantum yields.
Nonionic PAGs include oxime sulfonates,16−19 oxime esters,20 and N-sulfonyloxyimides.21 The choice of PAG for an application depends upon many
factors such as the wavelength of radiation,22−27 quantum efficiency of acid generation, solubility in the casting
solvent,28 thermal and hydrolytic stability,
toxicity, strength of the liberated acid,3−5 line width,29 acid diffusion,30 and environmental considerations.31,32 Although the
mechanism of the photochemical decomposition of Crivello salts has
been studied,3−5 less is known about how nonionic PAGs release acid.
In this paper, a commercial UV light PAG called Irgacure PAG 10333−37 is examined and key photochemical decomposition products are characterized.

Results
and Discussion
A batch of compound 1, known
as Irgacure PAG 103,
was generously supplied to us for study from a UK division of BASF
in Cheadle. This compound, which is soluble in organic solvents, can
be used in polymer resists to produce a positive image and for the
curing of resins. It has been the subject of numerous patents.33−37 However, to date, we have found no published synthesis or data for
this compound and only one study of its degradation by photochemical
irradiation to give two products.38 The
two products were characterized by advanced NMR, and it was not concluded
that this PAG 1 released acid upon irradiation. Here, we report an
additional degradation product, and a mechanism is proposed to explain
how these may form. Two of the degradation products and the stereochemistry
of the starting material, were verified by X-ray single crystal structure
determinations. This information is relevant because it helps to understand
how acid is released from it and what structural features are important
for this particularly because the design of photoacid releasing compounds39−41 remains a topical subject both academically and commercially.3−5 Compound 1 was irradiated with a low power 6 W UV lamp
at 254 nm in an immersion well. This setup is user friendly and is
suitable for undergraduates; it is air cooled by a fume hood fan and
it avoids a powerful 400 W medium pressure mercury lamp inside an
immersion well containing a large volume of flammable solvent. The
solution was not deoxygenated because some PAGs operate in thin films
in air. The products 2–4 were purified by chromatography
on silica gel (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Photochemical decomposition of Irgacure PAG 103 1.
Yields: 2 (25%); 3 + 4 (60%).
Compound 1 was irradiated with a 6 W 254 nm UV lamp in
an immersion well.

Figure 2 shows the
molecular structure of the starting material 1 and the
molecular structures of two products 2 and 4. Figure 2 Top shows
the starting material 1. Analysis by thin-layer chromatography
showed that the two products were successfully separated by chromatography.
The front less polar spot was fully characterized spectroscopically,
and the structure was confirmed as compound 2 by an X-ray
single crystal structure determination (Figure 2 middle). This corroborates the literature
result. However, the more polar spot was an inseparable mixture of
compounds 3 and 4 which were separated and
analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)
(Figure S1 and Table S1) and characterized
spectroscopically as an approximately equal mixture of two compounds
(Supporting Information). Compound 3 had the expected molecular mass of 211; it lacked a methyl
group and only one methyl group was present in the proton and carbon
NMR spectra which belonged to compound 4. Selective crystallization
gave crystals which solved for one of the components, compound 4 (Figure 2 bottom). The absence of compound 3 in the previous
study is unknown.

Figure 2 Top: molecular structure of Irgacure PAG 103 (molecule
C1) 1; middle: photochemical decomposition product 2; and bottom: photochemical decomposition product 4.
Figures show 50% displacement ellipsoids in each case.

Figure 3 shows
a
mechanism for the formation of products 2 and 3. The starting material must first undergo a UV light catalyzed Z/E isomerization to a less favorable isomer 5. Presumably structure 1 is the preferred thermodynamic
isomer because the nitrile aligns with the oxime nitrogen atom rather
than the more bulky aryl ring and the thioenol ether is trans to the
nitrile. Light-catalyzed cis–trans isomerizations of stilbenes
are well documented in the literature.42,43 Intermediate 5 could undergo a 6π electrocyclisation, as shown, which
involves the oxime sulfonate forming a ring at the ipso site carrying
the methyl group. Intermediate 6 could fragment to a
resonance-stabilized carbocation 7, assisted by the electron
rich thiophene ring, followed by a migration of the methyl group to
intermediate 9 and finally loss of the proton forming
product 2 and propylsulfonic acid 8. Product 2 has a migrated methyl group which allows the system to aromatize.
Migration of the methyl group is more suited to a rearranging carbocation
because carbocations are prone to rearrange and require the ring to
form first before fragmentation of the N–O bond. Hence, the
rearranged product is an indication of the mechanistic pathway. If
intermediate 7 or 9 is demethylated by either
the solvent, water, or the counterion 8, then, product 3 is formed. Product 3 might also form via homolytic
fragmentation of the N–O bond of compound 5 (not
shown), followed by ipso cyclization of an aminyl radical and elimination
of a methyl group free radical but this mechanism would not give product 2. Products 2 and 3 can arise from
the same reaction pathway. Aqueous extracts of the dichloromethane
(DCM) solution were shown to be of low pH with universal indicator
paper proving that acid is liberated in these reactions but it would
be for forming product 2 and not necessarily for forming
product 3.

Figure 3 Mechanism proposed for the formation of products 2 and 3. Intermediates 5–9 have not
been isolated.

Figure 4 shows a
mechanism for the formation of product 4. Intermediate 5 could undergo a 6π electrocyclization to give intermediate 10 which can give product 4 by a facile elimination
of propylsulfonic acid 8. Hence, this pathway retains
the aryl methyl group and is efficient in producing acid 8.

Figure 4 Proposed mechanism for the formation of product 4.

Both the mechanistic pathways in Figures 3 and 4 require the
release of propylsulfonic acid. A crude reaction mixture was assayed
by proton NMR in CDCl3 and CD3OD which showed
the presence of propylsulfonic acid (Figures S16 and S17).

Crystal Structures
The asymmetric
unit of 1 consists of three molecules, A, B, and C. They
differ in the dihedral
angles between the benzene and thiophene rings [69.53 (15), 55.64
(16), and 72.7 (2)° for A, B, and C, respectively] and the conformation
of the O–S–C–C fragment of the propyl chain,
which is anti in A [torsion angle = 175.8 (3)°] and gauche in
B and C [−58.2 (3) and −57.1 (3)°, respectively].
Compound 2 crystallizes with one almost planar molecule
in the asymmetric unit (rms deviation for the atoms in the fused rings
= 0.009 Å), whereas the asymmetric unit of 4 consists
of two molecules (Figures S2–S4).

Conclusions
Mechanisms are proposed for the photochemical
fragmentation of
the commercial photoacid generator Irgacure PAG 103 1. These are thought to be the first reactions of this type in organic
systems. The pathways involve an unusual type of 6π photocyclization
reaction which involves cyclization of an oxime sulfonate followed
by an elimination of propylsulfonic acid 8 which may
catalyze polymer resist modification. The rearrangement product 2 suggests a carbocation pathway is involved; hence, the photocyclisation
occurs first before fragmentation of the oxime N–O bond which
would involve free radicals rather than a carbocation. This mechanistic
understanding may help in the future design of more efficient and
sensitive PAGs for photocuring applications in polymer resists.

Experimental
Section
General
IR spectra were recorded on an ATI Mattson
FTIR spectrometer using KBr discs. UV spectra were recorded using
a PerkinElmer Lambda 25 UV–vis spectrometer with CH2Cl2 as the solvent. 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded at 400 and 100.5 MHz, respectively, using a
Varian 400 spectrometer. Chemical shifts, δ, are given in ppm
and measured by comparison with the residual solvent. Coupling constants, J, are given in Hz. Low resolution and high resolution mass
spectra were obtained at the University of Wales, Swansea, using electron
impact ionization and chemical ionization. Melting points were determined
on a Kofler hot-stage microscope. Irgacure PAG 103 was donated from
an agent of BTC.44

Liquid Chromatography–Mass
Spectrometry
For
analytical separation, an Agilent 1290 Infinity high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) system consisting of a quaternary HPLC pump,
cooled autosampler compartment, column compartment, and diode-array
UV-vis detector was used. A Kintex F5 column (2.1 × 150 mm, Phenomenex,
UK) was used for separation with a water/acetonitrile gradient (both
0.1% v/v formic acid) from 5% acetonitrile to 100% in 10 min. The
flow rate was 0.5 mL min–1, column temperature 40
°C, and sample volume 5 μL. The mass spectrometer [electrospray
MS (ES-MS)] used was a MAXIS II UHR-TOF LC–MS system (Bruker
UK Ltd) with an ESI source connected to the UV–vis detector
by a short length of Peek-tubing. The ES-MS was operated in a positive
ion mode with a capillary voltage of 4.5 kV using sodium formate clusters
for calibration and methyl stearate as lock mass. Mass spectra were
recorded automatically.

Crystallization Experiments
Compounds 1, 2, and 4 were
crystallized by the same
method. The compound (75 mg) was dissolved in a small quantity of
DCM (about 25 mL) in a 50 mL beaker. This was then carefully diluted
with light petroleum ether (40–60) until the solution turned
hazy. A small amount of DCM was then added to turn the solution clear.
This is then a good solvent composition to begin crystallization.
The beaker was covered in aluminum foil that had some small holes
in it, and the solution was left for a few days to evaporate the solvent.
A sample of partially crystalline material, a mixture of compounds 3 and 4, was sent away for a data set, and this
was successful. However, a partial, physical separation of material
to give either pure 3 or 4 by NMR was not
successful.

Intensity data for 1, 2, and 4 were collected at T = 100 K
on a Rigaku AFC11 CCD diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.54184 Å). The structures were solved by direct methods and
optimized by refinement against |F|2;
the H atoms were geometrically placed and refined as riding atoms.
