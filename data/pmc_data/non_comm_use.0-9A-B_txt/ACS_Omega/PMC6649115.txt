Histotripsy is a noninvasive and
nonthermal ultrasound ablation
technique, which mechanically ablates the tissues using very short,
focused, high-pressured ultrasound pulses to generate dense cavitating
bubble cloud. Histotripsy requires large negative pressures (≥28
MPa) to generate cavitation in the target tissue, guided by real-time
ultrasound imaging guidance. The high cavitation threshold and reliance
on real-time image guidance are potential limitations of histotripsy,
particularly for the treatment of multifocal or metastatic cancers.
To address these potential limitations, we have recently developed
nanoparticle-mediated histotripsy (NMH) where perfluorocarbon (PFC)-filled
nanodroplets (NDs) with the size of ∼200 nm were used as cavitation
nuclei for histotripsy, as they are able to significantly lower the
cavitation threshold. However, although NDs were shown to be an effective
histotripsy agent, they pose several issues. Their generation requires
multistep synthesis, they lack long-term stability, and determination
of PFC concentration in the treatment dose is not possible. In this
study, PFC-filled nanocones (NCs) were developed as a new generation
of histotripsy agents to address the mentioned limitations of NDs.
The developed NCs represent an inclusion complex of methylated β-cyclodextrin
as a water-soluble analog of β-cyclodextrin and perfluorohexane
(PFH) as more effective PFC derivatives for histotripsy. Results showed
that NCs are easy to produce, biocompatible, have a size <50 nm,
and have a quantitative complexation that allows us to directly calculate
the PFH amount in the used NC dose. Results further demonstrated that
NCs embedded into tissue-mimicking phantoms generated histotripsy
cavitation “bubble clouds” at a significantly lower
transducer amplitude compared to control phantoms, demonstrating the
ability of NCs to function as effective histotripsy agents for NMH.

Introduction
Histotripsy is a noninvasive
ultrasound (US) ablation technique,
which mechanically ablates soft tissue (i.e., tumors) through acoustic
cavitation mechanism. As a noninvasive and nonthermal technique, histotripsy
uses very short, focused, high-pressured US pulses to fractionate
the tissue.1−4 When these US pulses interact with the water inside of the tissue,
bubble clusters are nucleated, forming highly energetic microbubbles
that expand to a size of >50 μm, and rapidly collapse, releasing
energy into neighboring cells to mechanically fragment them to subcellular
debris.5,6 To generate this rapid bubble expansion
and collapse in histotripsy, a high negative pressure threshold (≥28
MPa) is required to initiate cavitation.7,8 Although histotripsy
has shown its potential for many clinical applications including tumor
ablation,9−12 the efficacy of this technique is limited to situations in which
a single target tumor can be identified and imaged before the treatment,13 which is not possible for treating micrometastases
or multiple tumor nodules. In addition, even with the image-guided
system, the operator (clinician) needs to be extremely careful to
accurately deliver US pulses to the focused area in order to avoid
cavitation in healthy neighboring cells.

To deal with these
limitations of targetability, selectivity, and
high cavitation pressure, our group has recently developed nanoparticle-mediated
histotripsy (NMH) as a novel ablation method to achieve selective
tumor ablation. We developed NMH in order to significantly reduce
the pressure required to selectively deliver histotripsy into the
target tissue, enhance treatment efficiency, and allow the selective
ablation of tumor cells while creating no effect on the neighboring
healthy cells. NMH feasibility was demonstrated for the first time
using perfluorocarbon (PFC)-filled nanodroplets (NDs) as a cavitation
nuclei capable of reducing the histotripsy cavitation threshold.14,15 These NDs were synthesized using a tri-block amphiphilic copolymer
which encapsulates low-boiling point PFCs, either perfluoropentane
(PFP) or perfluorohexane (PFH), as a result of their self-assembly
into nanosized (∼200 nm) droplets.15 Phase transition of PFC in the core of NDs from liquid to gas through
acoustic droplet vaporization forms nanobubbles under the US pulses,
and these nanobubbles act like cavitation sites, and initiate the
cavitation at lower cavitation threshold pressure.13 Detailed studies about NMH showed1,8,13,14,16,17 that using the NDs
as the cavitation nuclei significantly lowered the cavitation threshold
pressure (∼7 MPa vs 28 MPa without droplets) and allowed cavitation
to occur selectively only in the regions where the NDs localize at
the lowered cavitation pressure value.14 However, although NDs successfully addressed the selectivity and
high cavitation threshold limitations of histotripsy, these first-generation
histotripsy agents were associated with a few shortcomings that called
for the development of new histotripsy agents. First of all, the synthesis
of the NDs is complex, needs multiple steps, and requires expertise
in the field of polymer chemistry. Second, the size of the NDs (∼200
nm) is adequate for accumulation into the tumor tissue through an
enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, as supported
by previous examples in the literature.18−23 However, recent research has shown that a smaller size is better
for EPR tumor accumulation, especially in early stage tumor formation.24,25 Third, determining PFC concentration is important for NDs to be
effective and consistent between the treatments. For prior NMH experiments,
NDs concentration was determined using secondary concentration detection
methods such as the nanoparticle tracking analysis system. This method
provides concentration as a number of NDs/mL; however, the specific
PFC amount in the NDs not only depends on solution concentration but
also depends on size and size distribution of NDs. This means that
every ND sample had a different amount of PFC, which makes it impossible
to determine the exact concentration of PFC in the used solution.
Lastly, stability of NDs was limited and requires cold storage conditions.
Based on these limitations, there is a significant need for a new,
practical, stable, and biocompatible histotripsy agent, which allows
molecular-level isolation of PFC into nanosized (<50 nm) structures
and provides concentration information of PFC without using secondary
detection techniques.

Cyclodextrins (CDs) are Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved,
biocompatible, nanosized molecules composed of glucopyranose units.26,27 They are also known as cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of different
numbers of cyclic sugar units. CDs used in the field of biomedicine
are α-cyclodextrins, β-cyclodextrins (BCD), and γ-cyclodextrins
consisting of six, seven, and eight glucopyranose units, respectively.28 CDs have a conical shape with a hydrophilic
exterior surface and a hydrophobic internal cavity.29 They are known for their efficient role as a host molecule
in an inclusion complex, and they have been reported to improve the
solubility, bioactivity, and stability of many hydrophobic molecules.30,31 Research has shown that among the abovementioned CDs, BCD has been
proven to be the most effective in forming inclusion complexes with
PFCs because of the size compatibility of the PFC chain and the BCD
cavity.32 An early example shown by Hogen-Esch
et al. presents characterization of an inclusion complex formed between
BCD and a PFC alkyl chain containing water-soluble polymers.33 Later, more work was published, for environmental
purposes, to show the pollutant removal potential of the inclusion
complex because some perfluorinated compounds, especially perfluoroalkyl
carboxylic acid and perfluoroalkylsulfonates, are considered as a
new class of persistent organic pollutants. In this regard, inclusion
complex formation between BCD and different perfluoroalkyl carboxylic
acids and their physicochemical characterization have been deeply
studied.34−36 The only example that used the BCD/PFC inclusion
complex for an US-related application was recently published.37 In this work, PFC used for US imaging (FC-77)
was complexed with BCD at different PFC/BCD ratios. Even though US
imaging potential of the complex was shown, the size of the complex
was reaching the micron level depending on the PFC/BCD ratio, resulting
in one PFC chain having two BCD molecules in a complex. To the best
of our knowledge, there are no prior studies that use CD–PFC
inclusion complexes for the histotripsy application.

The intramolecular
hydrogen bonding of the secondary hydroxyl group
of BCD leads to low aqueous solubility, which can be improved by increasing
the temperature. However, this can cause problems such as evaporation
of PFC from the system when BCD and volatile PFC derivatives attempt
to form the inclusion complex. To increase water solubility of BCD
at room temperature, it is necessary to substitute the hydrogens of
hydroxyl groups by methoxy functions.38 Among the other methods to increase water solubility of BCD, the
methylation of BCD stands out as an economical and efficient method
in the literature.38 Moreover, methylated
β-cyclodextrin (MCD) is used as an approved pharmaceutical component
of certain drug delivery products.39,40 Therefore,
it appeared to be a good choice for our study because after methylation,
the solubility increases and provides a more suitable environment
for PFC complexation with higher efficiency. At the same time, it
is still biocompatible, practical, and small as host molecules.

We hypothesized that hydrophobic PFH, as the most effective PFC
for histotripsy,13 can go into the hydrophobic
cavity of the biocompatible, cone-shaped BCD derivatives in an aqueous
environment to form an inclusion complex through host–guest
interaction, resulting in solid “nanocones” (NCs) as
a new generation histotripsy agent. Preparation of NCs is as easy
as mixing two commercial and widely available compounds in an aqueous
environment with a certain ratio and then collecting precipitated
NCs through simple filtration. These NCs are expected to be of smaller
size (<50 nm), and through complexed PFH, they can lower the cavitation
threshold pressure for histotripsy. Moreover, the PFH amount in these
NCs can be easily calculated, as it is directly proportional to the
concentration of the NCs.

In this study, NCs, as the new histotripsy
agent, were synthesized
through host–guest interaction of FDA-approved, water-soluble
derivatives of BCD (methylated BCD) and PFH through a practical and
economical method with the size of less than 50 nm. The efficiency
of inclusion complex formation was investigated, and quantitative
complexation was achieved using better water-soluble derivative of
BCD as a biocompatible and stable product. The amount of PFC in the
obtained NCs was calculated, which acts as an important feature as
it can be tuned differently for different treatments. Once all the
physicochemical characterizations were performed, histotripsy parameters
of NCs were studied to determine if NCs could effectively lower the
cavitation threshold and act as an efficient histotripsy agent.

Results
and Discussion
Preparation of NCs through Host–Guest
Interactions
Initially, NCs formation was examined using
BCD and PFH because
BCD is the most commonly used CD derivative to form inclusion complexes
with PFC derivatives. PFH was chosen as the PFC derivative because
it was shown that PFH provides sustainable cavitation nuclei and allows
generation of well-defined lesions at different frequencies.13 Even though PFP (bp ≈ 29 °C, surface
tension ≈ 9.5 mN/m) lowers cavitation threshold pressure ∼1–3
MPa more than PFH (bp ≈ 56 °C, surface tension ≈
11.9 mN/m), obtaining sustainable cavitation nuclei and well-defined
lesions are assessed as more important in order to have control over
NMH treatments. Host–guest interaction between BCD and PFH
was investigated at different BCD/PFH molar ratios of 1:1, 1:5, 1:20,
and 1:50, by dissolving BCD in water at 80 °C, to ensure complete
solubility, and cooled down to a temperature (45 °C) lower than
boiling point of PFH before its addition. The complexation efficiency
of the NCs was calculated using gas chromatography (GC). A calibration
curve was constructed within a concentration range, including minimum
and maximum PFH amounts that can be loaded into the BCD cavity, and
the area of this known concentration of PFH was compared to the area
of anisole, which was used as an internal standard at constant concentration
for each measurement (Figure S1). For each
NCs sample, the complexation efficiency was different and varied significantly
from each other. For 1:1, 1:5, 1:20, and 1:50, the complexation efficiency
turned out to be 68 ± 9, 31 ± 7, 27 ± 2, and 89 ±
21%, respectively. Increasing the ratio to 1:50 resulted in a higher
complexation efficiency, but the variations in the results were high
as well. It was observed that because of its lower solubility in water
at room temperature (18.5 mg/mL), BCD started precipitating once the
temperature was below 60 °C. This heterogeneity might cause the
inconsistency of the complexation efficiency because the solution
was already heterogeneous, and most of the BCD dissolved in water
was already precipitated at the time of PFH addition (Figure 1a).

of synthesis of NCs through host–guest
interaction between PFH and (a) BCD and (b) MCD. The flask at each
step shows the solubility of the CD derivatives at room temperature
before and after the complexation (photos were taken by one of the
authors, Tanzeel Ur Rehman).

Thus, increasing water solubility of BCD would help us verify
the
above statement. To address this point and increase the complexation
efficiency, the solubility of BCD was increased by a simple process
of random methylation of BCD as a common and practical method in the
literature. Methylation of BCD was performed using dimethyl carbonate
anhydrous (DMC) and K2CO3 by dissolving BCD
in dimethylformamide anhydrous (DMF).41−43 The structural confirmation
and degree of methylation of BCD were analyzed using nuclear magnetic
resonance and mass spectroscopy, respectively. There was a clear peak
shift, and −OH peaks diminished on the 1H NMR spectrum
of MCD (Figure S2) and the carbon signal
of the incorporated methyl group can be clearly seen in the 13C NMR spectrum (Figure S3) as well. The
mass spectrum of MCD indicated high population of low degree of methylation
such as 2,4,6,8-methyl groups per molecule (Figure S4), and this was enough to significantly increase the solubility
in aqueous medium. The mixture of MCD and PFH in water at room temperature
resulted in a completely clear solution, followed by fine precipitate
of their complex as NCs that can be taken by simple filtration and
dried out as solid powder (Figure 1b). The way of using low-degree methylated BCD allowed
us to establish an efficient synthesis and practical purification
way for NCs preparation. Because the host molecule is completely soluble
at room temperature and more available for the guest molecule, the
amount of PFH used for complexation was lowered. For the molar ratios
of 1:2 and 1:5 (MCD/PFH), the complexation efficiencies were revealed
to be 97 ± 2 and 98 ± 3%, respectively, which accounts for
approximately absolute complexation with a reasonable value of gravimetric
yield comprising 40 ± 3% for 1:2 and 71 ± 7% for 1:5. This
is sufficient evidence to argue for practical and economical production
of a new histotripsy agent. However, to see the effect of the MCD/PFH
ratio on the complexation, the amount of PFH was increased to 1:10
(MCD/PFH) and the complexation efficiency was calculated as 130 ±
4% with the gravimetric yield of 68 ± 4%, indicating the possibility
of having more than one PFH molecule in the cavity of MCD when the
concentration of PFH is further increased. A MCD/PFH ratio of 1:5
was chosen as the most effective ratio because it provides the uniform
sample of 1:1 complexation with a higher gravimetric yield and high
complexation efficiency that will allow the calculation of the PFH
amount more accurately.

Characterizations of the NCs
The
NCs, which refers
to the inclusion complex of methylated BCD and PFH, were first characterized
using NMR spectroscopy. Even though 3 and 5 protons of glucopyranose
units of MCD which lie inside the cavity and 6 which lies at the minor
border of the cavity did not show significant peak shift at 1H NMR (Figure S5), 19F NMR
clearly confirmed the presence of fluorine of PFH in the NCs (Figure 2a). The spectrum
of NCs showed peaks of fluorine, which confirms the development of
the complex, as MCD contains no fluorine atoms. Moreover, a clear
peak shift can be seen in the spectrum of NCs when compared to the
spectrum of free PFH (Figure 2b). As can be seen, examining the Δδ ppm values
for the peaks of CF3 and CF2, labeled as a,
b, and c, listed in Table S1, all the peaks
showed down field shift, and the peak a, which represents the peak
of CF3, has the highest Δδ ppm value (1.485),
followed by peak b (1.297) and then peak c (1.074). This is consistent
with the data of Gou et al. confirming the formation of the complex.32

sulfoxide
(DMSO-d6) and (b) PFH without using the
solvent. Trifluoroacetic acid in CDCl3 was inserted into
the NMR tube as internal 19F chemical shift standard.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
was performed to confirm the
methylation of BCD and the formation of NCs. The FTIR spectrum of
BCD, MCD, PFH, and NCs are presented in Figure S6. The spectrum of BCD showed a characteristic peak at 3200–3400
cm–1 because of the O–H group stretching.
The characteristic peak at 2854 cm–1 is seen because
of C–H asymmetric/symmetric stretching. Additionally, a peak
at 1643 cm–1 represented the H–O–H
deformation bands of water present in the BCD cavity. Peaks at 1152
and 1022 cm–1 indicated C–H overtone stretching.44 The spectrum of MCD shows all the above characteristic
peaks of BCD. According to the literature, for PFH, the characteristic
peaks of CF2 appear at 1230 and 1150 cm–1, whereas the characteristic peak of CF3 appears at 1210
cm–1.34,45−47 The same characteristic peaks were seen in the FTIR spectrum of
PFH as 1235, 1143, and 1199 cm–1 (Figure S6). Although, the peak at 1143 cm–1 was overlapping with the peak of BCD and MCD, clear peaks can be
seen at 1242 cm–1 in the spectrum of NCs, indicating
the presence of PFH in the cavity, hence providing evidence for the
formation of the complex.

Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA)
of NCs was performed to investigate
the thermal behavior of the complex and to evaluate the low boiling
point of PFH evaporation from the system. Figure 3 shows the comparison of TGA thermograms
of BCD, MCD, and NCs. The first stage of BCD’s thermogram was
around 25–110 °C, with the midpoint of 73.0 °C indicating
weight loss due to water evaporation, which was calculated as 9.55%,
whereas the thermogram of MCD showed a weight loss of 7.68% for the
same region at the midpoint of 62.2 °C. On the contrary, the
thermogram of NCs showed higher weight loss around 19.25% at this
region, and the temperature of weight loss was increased from 62.2
to 72.1 °C, indicating the presence of PFH in the structure.
This increase in weight loss indicates the low boiling point (56 °C)
PFH evaporation from the cavity that was also confirmed by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis presented in Figure S7. When the contribution of water evaporation of MCD
on weight loss was subtracted from the weight loss of NCs, the obtained
weight loss evaluated as weight loss associated with PFH evaporation.
This information was used to calculate complexation efficiency as
93%, which supported the data obtained from GC. After initial weight
loss because of either water or PFH evaporation, BCD, MCD, and NCs
exhibited main degradation at around 315, 300, and 260 °C, respectively.

BCD, MCD, and NCs.

To obtain further proof
of inclusion complex formation, change
on the morphology and the elemental analysis of the samples were conducted
via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX). Figure 4 shows the images at high and low magnifications of BCD, MCD,
and NCs, including elemental analysis data and elemental mapping of
the NCs. As can be seen in the figure, methylation of CD caused morphology
change supported by the EDX data that showed increase in the atomic
ratio of C as well. While BCD showed the atomic ratio of C as 43.87%,
and the atomic ratio of O as 56.13%, MCD showed 63.65 and 34.19%,
respectively (Figure 4a,c). An elemental analysis of the NCs made of MCD and PFH showed
the atomic ratio of C as 61.25%, the atomic ratio of O as 34.14%,
and the atomic ratio of F as 4.35%, indicating presence of PFH in
the structure through complex formation (Figure 4e). Moreover, a clear difference was seen
in the micrograph of NCs, which showed a small platelike structure,
compared to the MCD and BCD (Figure 4f). EDX is a useful technique that allows identifying
the few atom thickness nanostructures to see the elemental distribution. Figure 4g–i shows
that the elemental mapping of NCs showed the continuous distribution
of the fluorine atom throughout the sample. NCs prepared with the
MCD/PFH ratio of 1:5 and 1:10 were also analyzed via EDX (Figure S8) to compare fluorine percentage, and
the results revealed that the NCs with 1:10 contained almost 25% more
fluorine content than NCs with 1:5, which is correlated with the data
obtained from GC.

As stated before in the hypothesis
of the work, NCs are expected
to have a smaller size than NDs. The size of NCs was examined using
0.1 mg/mL aqueous solution of NCs via two different methods, that
is, dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure 5a) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
(Figure 5b). According
to the DLS results, the size of BCD and MCD were measured as 119.94
± 47 nm, and 85.64 ± 13 nm, respectively. Low water solubility
of BCD resulted in a bigger size with a large error bar, while improved
solubility of MCD caused decrease in the size. The size of the NCs
was 37.75 ± 7 nm, indicating better dispersion in water correlated
with the published data that show inclusion complexes may have smaller
size than their CD derivatives48 (Figure 5a). In addition to
DLS measurements, the size of the NCs was confirmed through an imaging
technique. A well-dispersed NCs solution at a given concentration
was dropped on the TEM grids and dried out before imaging. It was
observed that NCs appear as very small spots on a scale of 100 nm,
and it can be concluded that the size of the NCs is certainly lower
than 50 nm (Figure 5b).

their 0.1 mg/mL solution in water, (b) TEM image of a 0.1 mg/mL solution
of NCs showing size distribution on a scale of 100 nm.

Biocompatibility of the NCs
Biocompatibility
is one
of the most important properties for any agent that is designed relying
on the systemic blood circulation. An ideal agent is expected to not
hemolyze the red blood cells (RBC) and to not affect the viability
of the healthy cells. Even though BCD is an FDA-approved compound
and PFCs are not metabolized in the body, they can be removed simply
via inhalation;18 NCs were still tested
for their hemolytic activity and cell viability to provide evidence
that methylation and complex formation do not change the biocompatibility
of the compounds. First, the interaction between NCs and RBCs was
investigated to see whether NCs cause hemolysis on RBCs. To eliminate
any additional absorption apart from the free hemoglobin absorption,
the plasma layer was removed from the blood sample and replaced with
sodium chloride solution. The hemolytic activity of the NCs was examined
via the RBCs interaction comparison of BCD, MCD, and NCs at 0.1, 0.5,
and 1.0 mg/mL concentrations, and the results are presented in Figure 6. For concentrations
of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/mL, BCD showed a hemolysis of 10.9 ±
0.45, 9.5 ± 0.42, and 4.8 ± 0.37%, respectively. The decrease
on hemolysis by increasing concentration of BCD is associated with
aqueous solubility of BCD because high concentration of BCD results
in larger aggregates in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (data not
shown), decreasing the overall particle concentration. Hence, a lower
number of BCD particles interacts with the RBCs, resulting in a lower
hemolysis percentage. The increase in the concentration of MCD, on
the other hand, revealed the hemolysis percentage to be 11.9 ±
0.46, 9.6 ± 0.41, and 16.1 ± 0.32% for the similar concentrations,
respectively, because of the increasing number of methyl groups on
the outer surface of the CD, which results in slightly increased hemolytic
activity of MCD. Furthermore, MCD has better water solubility than
BCD, and increase in hemolysis by increasing concentration indicates
the real behavior of the compound. The lowest hemolysis was caused
by the NCs at each of these concentrations. At a concentration of
0.1 mg/mL, only a hemolysis of 9.6 ± 0.43% was recorded, and
at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/mL, a hemolysis of 5.2 ± 0.34, and 3.1 ±
0.34%, respectively, were recorded. Decrease in hemolytic activity
while increasing concentration of NCs was slightly more noticeable
than decrease in hemolytic activity of BCD by the same effect. This
is consistent with the data in the literature that inclusion complexes
are less hemolytic than host molecules.49 Even though it is not statistically significant, the decrease in
hemolytic activity by increased concentration can be attributed to
the slight increase in size (79.14 nm, see in Figure S9), which lowers NCs cell interaction.

caused by BCD, MCD, and NCs at different concentration.
Statistical difference between percentage hemolysis was evaluated
using the two-way ANOVA plus Tukey postcomparison test, where ** denotes p ≤ 0.01 and *** denotes p ≤
0.001.

Second, cellular cytotoxicity
of NCs was investigated on healthy
human embryonic kidney cells, HEK-293T, which are the cells that almost
all reagent injected into body somehow passes by, as these cells will
be responsible for cleaning out any trace of NCs. For this purpose,
similar concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/mL were tested for
BCD, MCD and NCs. The selected concentrations were high enough to
show any dose-dependent cytotoxicity of NCs. Thus, if necessary, the
concentration of the NCs, which is directly proportional to the concentration
of PFH, can be increased up to 1.0 mg/mL to further reduce the cavitation
threshold. Figure 7 displays the results of the cell viability of each material at different
concentrations. It was revealed that, upon incubation of the cells
with the NCs, the cells were more viable than any other compound.
For concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL, the NCs showed 94.5% cell viability,
whereas BCD and MCD showed 92.6 and 89.6%, respectively. The results
were similar for 0.5 mg/mL as they showed 89.3% cell viability for
BCD, 85.4% for MCD, and 97.9% for the NCs. For 1.0 mg/mL, the cell
viabilities of BCD and the NCs were comparable as 87.4 and 86.8% cells
were viable. MCD showed a decrease in the cell viability at 1.0 mg/mL,
which was calculated as 69.4% that was consistent with the hemolysis
data. Overall, NCs show better cell viability than their precursors.

Tukey postcomparison test).

Histotripsy Efficiency and the Effect on the Cavitation Pressure
Threshold
It was hypothesized that NCs will cause cavitation
at lower cavitation pressure threshold, similar to NDs used in previous
NMH experiments. This hypothesis was tested by applying single-cycle
500 kHz histotripsy pulses to the agarose gels phantom using pulse
repetition frequency of 1 Hz at peak negative pressures of 16.0, 20.5,
and 28.5 MPa. The corresponding peak positive pressure values were
18.8, 25.0, and 34.4 MPa, respectively. A 500 kHz transducer was used
with 5 cycles per pulse. Tissue-mimicking phantoms were used to provide
a well-controlled viscoelastic medium, which is very important for
the study as the damage in the tissue induced by the histotripsy highly
depends on the mechanical properties of the tissue.14 Three different tissue-mimicking phantoms were prepared,
including 0.7, 7 μg NCs/mL as the sample, and the empty phantom
as the negative control (Figure 8). Results showed that histotripsy pulses did not create
significant bubbles in the empty phantom until 28.5 MPa, which is
the pressure that corresponds to the threshold cavitation pressure
of normal histotripsy without an agent. Similar histotripsy applications
on the phantoms that contain 0.7 and 7 μg NCs/mL, which correspond
to 1 × 10–4 and 1 × 10–3 μL PFH/mL, caused bubble formation at the transducer driving
voltage as low as 45 V (16.0 MPa), showing that even a small amount
of PFH inside the NCs can cavitate the histotripsy at lower pressures
(Figure 8). Moreover,
only MCD (empty NCs) containing phantom indicated the necessity of
PFH for cavitation by not showing any cavitation at the tested, 27
MPa, pressure value (Figure S10). More
theoretical and experimental work needs to be done to investigate
the cavitation mechanism of NCs, as well as a full comparison of the
effects of NCs concentration on the histotripsy cavitation threshold
including a comparison of the thresholds for NCs and our previously
used NDs. These studies are currently in progress.

Figure 8 Bubble cloud was generated
using NCs as the histotripsy agent in
agarose tissue phantoms exposed to histotripsy pulses at peak negative
pressures of 16.0, 20.5, and 28.5 MPa. The empty phantom was used
as the negative control.

Conclusions
Overall, the results of this study demonstrate
the feasibility
of PFH-filled NCs as new generation histotripsy agents for NMH. These
NCS were prepared through host–guest interaction between water-soluble
derivative of CDs (MCD) and US-active PFH molecule; resulting in NMH
nanoparticles that are easier to produce and more cost-/time-effective
compared to the NDs used in prior NMH studies. The NCs are also smaller
in size (<50 nm), which is expected to give a better chance of
accumulation into the tumor tissue through the EPR effect. This is
necessary for NMH to selectively ablate target tumors at lower pressures
than of those used inconventional histotripsy. In addition, unlike
the NDs, the PFH amount in the NCs can be directly determined in order
to tune the PFH dose in planned NMH treatments, which further supports
the superiority of the NCs. Additionally, the synthesis of NCs is
easy, cost-effective, stable, and they are biocompatible. The NCs
did not show hemolytic activity against RBCs and did not significantly
affect the cell viability of the healthy human embryonic kidney cells
(HEK 293T) even at the concentration as high as 1 mg/mL. Finally,
NCs were able to lower the cavitation pressure threshold of histotripsy
below 16.0 MPa using only 1 × 10–4 μL
PFH/mL, which is a significantly smaller total volume of PFH than
what was previously used in NDs-mediated histotripsy. Together, the
results from this initial study demonstrate the potential of NCs for
the NMH therapy, and pave the way for future studies optimizing NCs
design as well as the continued development of NMH as a controllable
method for targeted tumor ablation.

Experimental Section
Materials
Materials used were BCD (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%),
perfluorohexane (PFH, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), DMC (Alfa Aesar, 99%),
potassium carbonate anhydrous (K2CO3, Sigma-Aldrich,
99.99%), anisole anhydrous (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.7%), DMF anhydrous (Sigma-Aldrich,
99.8%), DMSO (Merck, 99%), acetone (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%), diethyl
ether anhydrous (DEE, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), sodium chloride anhydrous
(NaCl, Wisent Bioproducts, 99%), PBS (pH 7.4, Multicell, Wisent Inc.),
ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%), Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Multicell, Wisent Inc.), fetal bovine serum (FBS) advanced,
heat inactivated (FBS, Capricorn Scientific GmbH), l-glutamine
200 mM solution (29.23 mg/mL in 0.85% NaCl, Multicell, Wisent Inc.),
penicillin streptomycin solution (10 000 U/mL, Multicell, Wisent
Inc.), trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (0.25% trypsin
in HBSS, Multicell, Wisent Inc.), and trypan blue solution, (Sigma-Aldrich,
0.4%).

Methylation of BCD
BCD was randomly methylated using
the procedure described in Gan et al.41 Briefly, BCD (2.64 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (60
mL) in a two-necked round-bottom flask, which was connected to a condenser
on the top. After complete dissolution of BCD, K2CO3 (14.5 mmol) was added to the solution. Furthermore, DMC (66
mmol) was added drop-by-drop and stirred for 24 h at 45 °C under
N2 atmosphere. Subsequently, K2CO3 was removed by centrifuging the solution at 2000 rpm for 5 min.
The solvent was removed from the solution by vacuum distillation,
during which the residue turned into a syrup-like concentration. MCD
was then precipitated using acetone and rinsed three times using diethyl
ether. After filtration and drying process, the obtained solid was
crystallized in water, filtered, and washed with acetone. The solid
product was dried under vacuum and stored at room temperature before
use. 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ): 5.85–5.61 (m, −OH2,3),
4.87–4.78 (m, 7H, H1), 4.45 (br, −OH6), 3.71–3.49 (m, H3,6,5), 3.43–3.24
(m, H4,2, −OCH3); 13C NMR (126 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ): 102.39 (C1), 81.99 (C4), 73.90–72.04 (C2,3,5), 69.20 (C3–OCH3), 67.51–67.13
(C6–OCH3), 60.37
(C6, C2–OCH3).

Preparation of NCs Using MCD and PFH
MCD (4.4 ×
10–2 mmol) was dissolved in double-distilled water
(1 mL) at room temperature and PFH at different molar ratios (1, 5,
10 folds) was added to the vial of MCD followed by gradual precipitation
of the NCs as the product. After overnight stirring, the solutions
were placed in the fridge at 4 °C for 1 h, and then centrifuged
at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted and the precipitate
was dried under vacuum. 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ): 5.73 (br, −OH2,3),
4.87–4.78 (m, 7H, H1), 4.47 (br, −OH6), 3.72–3.50 (m, H3,6,5), 3.44–3.26
(m, H4,2, −OCH3).

Determination of Hemocompatibility
The plasma supernatant
of human blood (8 mL) was discarded after centrifuging at 3500 rpm
for 5 min. The RBCs were washed three times using a 150 mM saline
solution. After the third wash, the RBCs solution was resuspended
in 100 mM PBS (pH 7.4), followed by 10-fold dilution using PBS. Solutions
of desired concentrations of the NCs (1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 mg/mL) were
prepared in PBS pH 7.4 and mixed with 400 μL of RBCs solution
and PBS to reach 2 mL final volume. Each solution was prepared as
triplicate, as well as control solutions. The solutions were incubated
at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the RBCs solutions were centrifuged
at 13 000 rpm for 5 min, resulting in intact and ruptured RBCs
to pellet out, leaving the hemoglobin in the supernatant solution.
The supernatant (200 μL) was transferred to a 96-well plate
from each tube, and absorbance was measured at 541 nm as an indication
of hemolysis. The observed hemolysis of untreated RBCs in PBS solution
and in 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 solution was used as negative and positive
controls, respectively. The observed hemolytic activity was normalized
with respect to control groups.

Cell Toxicity Studies
For the cell toxicity and cell
viability studies, human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T) were selected
because of their reliable growth and propensity for transfection.
Also, once the NCs are injected into blood circulation, they will
eventually interact with these cells inside the body. The concentrations
of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 mg/mL were tested on HEK-293T cells. Briefly,
HEK-293T were seeded in 96-well plates at a seeding density of 20 000
cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight before replacing the culture
medium with FBS-free culture medium, containing different concentrations
of BCD, MCD, and NCs (1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 mg/mL), and incubating for
24 h under normal culture conditions. The medium of the cells were
then replaced with 10 μL Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution
Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS assay reagent) containing 110 μL
medium and incubated for 2 h, followed by measuring the absorbance
of this solution at 490 nm using the SpectraMax i3 microplate reader.
Contribution of free culture medium was eliminated by subtracting
the absorbance of equal volume of culture medium at this wavelength
and cell viability calculated with respect to untreated controls.
The concentrations that result in statistically significant reduction
in cell viability were considered cytotoxic.

Ablation of the Agarose
Tissue Phantom Using NCs as a Histotripsy
Agent
The phantom was made using 1% agarose w/v by slowly
mixing agarose powder (Agarose type VII, Sigma-Aldrich) into saline
solution. The temperature of the solution was raised above 70 °C
until the solution became completely transparent. The solution was
then degassed using a partial pressure vacuum of 2.7 kPa for 30 min.
The agarose solution was then cooled down to 37 °C. To obtain
phantoms containing NCs, they were slowly added to different gel solutions
at around 40 °C while the solution was still stirring and cooling
down. The agarose mixture was then poured into rectangular molds made
of polycarbonate and placed at 4 °C. The solutions were allowed
to solidify, and the tissue phantoms embedded with NCs (test) and
without the NCs (negative control) were obtained. A 500 kHz transducer
was used to apply single-cycle histotripsy pulses, and the pulse repetition
frequency was set to 1.0 Hz. The results were recorded using a high-speed
camera.
