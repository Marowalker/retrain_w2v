We calculated the ground and low-lying
excited states of cyclopenta-fused
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CP-PAHs) using exact diagonalization
in full configuration interaction (CI) within the model Pariser–Parr–Pople
Hamiltonian as well as a time-dependent density functional theory
technique. The CP-PAHs include acenapthylene, isomers of pyracylene,
cycloocta-pentalene, and three isomers of dicyclo-pentacyclo-octenes
(DCPCO). We used the inherent symmetries of these systems to calculate
the energy ordering of the lowest singlet (S1) and lowest
triplet excited (T1) states with respect to the ground
state (S0). The calculation shows that the lowest dipole
allowed singlet absorption varies from 0.43 to 1.42 eV for most of
these systems. Such an optical absorption range is very promising
in harvesting solar radiation ranging from the visible to near-infrared
region improving the efficiency of photovoltaic device application.
The calculated optical gaps for pyracylene, acenapthylene, and two
isomers of DCPCO are in very good agreement with experimental results
reported in the literature. The calculated S1–T1 energy gaps (ΔST) in cycloocta-pentalene
and in the DCPCO isomers are very small ranging from 0.01 to 0.2 eV,
which is highly desirable in improving their electroluminescence efficiency
in light-emitting device applications.

1 Introduction
In the field of electronic
and optoelectronic devices, organic
conjugated systems have received major attention as they are cheap
and easy to fabricate. These conjugated systems serve the purpose
of an active material in designing photovoltaic devices with well
defined molecular architectures. Conjugated systems with a low band
gap (<2 eV) that can absorb solar radiation extending into the
red and near-infrared (NIR) region are strongly desirable to improve
the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). For
single junction OSCs, an optical band gap of about 1.3–1.7
eV is expected to be optimal.1,2 So, the lowest dipole
allowed singlet (S1) excited state energy will predict
the optical gap of the system. Similarly, the energy ordering of the
lowest triplet (T1) with respect to S1 is very
crucial so that population transfer from T1 to S1 can be achieved through reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). According
to spin statistics in the noninteracting limit, the upper bound of
singlet exciton formation is 25% in organic light-emitting diodes
(OLEDs).3,4 Generation of singlets is still small with
respect to triplets, even in the interacting picture. The efficiency
of electroluminescence in OLEDs can be enhanced through RISC as, according
to Kasha, emission occurs from the lowest dipole allowed singlet state
(S1) only.5 In general, for
conjugated systems, the lowest triplet energy E (T1) is lower than the lowest singlet energy E (S1), however in the process of RISC, it is very desirable
to have a S1–T1 energy gap that is of
the order of kBT (0.025
eV) so that S1 can be populated thermally. There are some
experimental reports on such conjugated systems with very small S1–T1 energy gaps (0.04 eV).6−10 In recent times, theoretical and computational investigations have
also predicted some conjugated systems with small S1–T1 energy gaps.11−14 In those cases, the S1–T1 energy gap
has been calculated using time-dependent density functional theory
(TDDFT), single configuration interaction (SCI), and the full CI technique.
Gierschner et al. reported carbozole–paraterphenyl systems
with donor–acceptor (D–A) substituents.11 Kohler et al. reported a planar and twisted conformation
of long conjugated oligomers.12 Theoretical
prediction at INDO level reported an S1–T1 energy gap of 0.8 eV in pentamers.13 Prodhan
et al. carried out a full CI calculation on model polyenes and showed
that the best system with a very low S1–T1 gap involves D substitution in one half of the carbons and A substitution
in the other half of the carbon atoms in the polyene chain.14 The energy ordering of S1 and T1 is also very important in photodynamic therapy. In this technique,
ground state (gs) triplet oxygen collides with an S1 photosensitizer
to give rise to singlet oxygen forming the T1 excited state.
The production of reactive singlet oxygen kills the tumor cell in
living organs.15

In this work, we
calculated the ground and excited states of seven
cyclopenta-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CP-PAHs). These
CP-PAHs were considered for our calculation as they have been the
recipients of a huge amount of attention due to their strong electron
affinities, chemical reactivities, and biological activities.16,17 Because of their high electron affinities they have been used in
several optoelectronic applications including organic photovoltaics
and field-effect transistors.18,19 Moreover, CP-PAHs have
been proven to be a biologically important species. They have been
used as DNA intercalators in chemotherapy to prevent DNA replication
in cancer cells.20,21 A theoretical understanding of
the electronic structures of these CP-PAHs would be helpful in explaining
their applicability. The strong electron–electron correlation
in these systems plays a very important role in determining the energy
ordering of these CP-PAHs. So, from the theoretical point of view,
it is very important to calculate the nature of the gs and the energy
ordering of the excited states to predict their suitability in optoelectronics.
These molecules are acenapthylene (a), pyracylene (b), an isomer of pyracylene called cycloocta-pentalene (c), dicyclo-pentacyclo-octenes (DCPCO) (d), and
three more isomers of DCPCO (e–g),
as shown in Figure 1. The isomer of DCPCO (g) is also called cycloocta-pentalene
(COP).

Figure 1 Geometries of acenapthylene (a), pyracylene (b), cyclopenta-acenapthylene (c), and isomers
of dicyclo-pentacyclo-octenes (DCPCO) (d–f), and cycloocta-pentalene (COP) (g).

The ground and low-lying excited
states of these conjugated systems
were calculated within the model Pariser–Parr–Pople
(PPP) Hamiltonian. As the CP-PAHs are composed of a maximum of 14
carbon atoms, one can express the model Hamiltonian in full CI basis
in both singlet and triplet subspaces within the PPP Hamiltonian.
We employed the inherent symmetries of these molecules to target the
desired excited states in the singlet and triplet subspaces. The symmetry
point group is C2v for
the molecule acenapthylene (a) and DCPCO isomers (e, f). The C2 axis
is in the plane of those molecules. The isomer of pyracylene called
cycloocta-pentalene (c) and the DCPCO isomer, cycloocta-pentalene
(g), possess Cs symmetry. Only the pyracylene (b) and DCPCO (d) molecules belong to the D2h point group. The model PPP Hamiltonian that describes
these molecules includes a kinetic energy contribution due to the
hopping of electrons from one atomic site to another and an explicit
electron–electron correlation in terms of the long-range Coulombic
potential. The electron–phonon interaction was not included
in the Hamiltonian. However, such electron–phonon interactions
may play a very important role in dictating the energy ordering of
excited states. Perturbations like steric hindrance and the electric
field driven distortion mechanism in such aromatic molecules have
been studied earlier.22,23 Vibrational instability may cause
a distortion and later on effect the energy ordering however this
is beyond the scope of the present study. We assumed undistorted optimized
gs geometries of the above molecules in our calculation.

We
also investigated the D and A substitution effect on the S1–T1 energy gap for these molecules. In the
next section, we discuss the ground and excited state energy ordering
followed by the effect of substitution at suitable positions in the
molecules. In Section 3, we summarize and conclude the study. Finally, we discuss the computational
approach for modeling these conjugated systems.

2 Results
and Discussion
Although spin is conserved in all of these
molecules, D2h symmetry
is present only in two systems,
pyracylene (b) and DCPCO (d). For these
two systems (b and d) in Figure 1, the gs lies in the A subspace and spin parity is even eA. The state strongly dipole coupled to the
gs also lies in even parity subspace eB termed as the one-photon state. The dipole-forbidden two-photon
state is in the even parity e2A subspace. However, the triplet states lie in the odd parity
(o) subspace. The presence of D2h symmetry reduces the dimensionality of the subspaces and helps
to target the energy states in A and B in both the singlet and triplet subspaces. However, for molecules
without D2h symmetry
(a, c, e, f, g in Figure 1), we carried out the full CI calculation in the singlet and triplet
subspaces. Obviously, we had to deal with the higher dimensionality
of the subspaces for those molecules.

We first discuss the results
of the low-lying excited states of
pyracylene (b) and DPCPO (d). The gs is
singlet 11Ag (S0) in both cases.
The lowest dipole allowed singlet excited state is 11Bu(S1). The dipole-forbidden two-photon state is
labeled as 21Ag. Finally, we calculated the
lowest triplet state (T1) and reported the spin gap EST = E(T1) – E(S0), three singlet gaps E1 = E(11Bu) – E(S0), E2 = E(21Bu) – E(S0), E3 = E(31Bu) – E(S0), and the lowest singlet (S1) to lowest triplet (T1) energy gap ΔST = |E(S1) – E(T1)|. We tabulated
the results in Table 1. The energy ordering of the two-photon (21Ag) and one-photon (11Bu) state is very important.
According to Kasha’s rule, a conjugated system is fluorescent
in nature if the lowest dipole allowed singlet state (11Bu) is energetically below the dipole-forbidden two-photon
state (21Ag).5 Let
us first consider the case of pyracylene molecule (b).
The lowest triplet state (T1) with respect to gs is at
1.12 eV. The three excited singlets are listed in Table 1. The one-photon state S1 (11Bu) is at 2.61 eV, and the rest
of the higher singlet states are at 3.20, 3.45, 3.60, and 4.21 eV.
T1 is below S1, which is, in general, common
in conjugated systems. The two-photon dipole-forbidden state (21Ag) is at 1.75 eV from gs, which is lower than
the one-photon state S1. This indicates that pyracylene
is not fluorescent. The calculated ΔST for pyracylene
is 1.49 eV. It is also interesting to report that for pyracylene (b), E(S1) – E(S0) (2.61 eV) is greater than 2*E(T1) – E(S0) (2.24 eV). However, E(T2) (2.15 eV) is nearly 0.1 eV lower than 2*E(T1) (2.24 eV). So, pyracylene may support the
idea of a singlet fission process, where a pair of correlated triplet
excitons is formed from one singlet excitation on a molecule as E(S1) is greater than 2*E(T1).24,25 However, as E(T2) is 0.1 eV lower than E(T1), possibility of the triplet–triplet annihilation
process cannot be ruled out for pyracylene. In Table 1, we compared the full CI results with the
TDDFT results for pyracylene. First, three singlet excited states
and the ΔST energy gaps are compared. The first three
singlet excited states are 2.0, 3.19, and 3.59 eV, whereas ΔST was calculated to be 0.43 eV. When comparing the two methodologies,
we found that the higher excited singlet state energies are comparable
except for the lowest singlet state. Also, the TDDFT calculation shows
lower ΔST as compared to that from the full CI calculation.
The singlet absorption values calculated from the two methodologies
are compared with existing absorption maxima observed in experiments
for the above molecules reported in the literature in a later part
of this article.

However, for DCPCO (d), in the PPP model,
S1 (11Bu) is at 0.48 eV, which is
very low, with
a comparatively high transition dipole moment probability (1.26 Debye). The other
three higher singlet states (21Bu, 31Bu, 41Bu) are at 2.44, 3.11, and
3.32 eV, respectively. So, this indicates that DCPCO (d) is a very good candidate for absorbing solar radiation from the
visible to NIR region. It should also be noted that T1 is
at 0.58 eV from gs, so it is nearly 0.09 eV higher than S1. This case violates Kasha’s rule. Even for such cases, as
the magnitude of ΔST is important, RISC could be
an attractive pathway to enhance the efficiency of an electroluminescent
device. The calculated two-photon state (21Ag) (1.57 eV) is above the one-photon state S1 (11Bu). This also suggests that DCPCO (d) is
fluorescent, unlike pyracylene. Moreover,
the TDDFT results for the four singlet excited states of DCPCO (d) are 1.03, 2.57, 2.74, and 4.05 eV and the magnitude of
ΔST is 0.24 eV. Both full CI and TDDFT methodologies
suggest that the lowest triplet state (T1) lies above S1 for DCPCO (d).

Next, we report the model
PPP and TDDFT results for the low-lying
excited states of the conjugated molecules without D2h symmetry (a, c, e, f, g), as shown in Figure 1. We only employed
spin parity symmetry and targeted the singlet and triplet subspaces
for these molecules. We calculated three low-lying singlet states
for these systems, along with a transition dipole moment. The lowest
triplet excited state (T1) energies and ΔST = E(S1) – E(T1) are summarized in Table 2. We first discuss the results obtained for acenapthylene
(a). The spin gap is 1.88 eV and the lowest dipole allowed
singlet excited state (S1) is 2.69 eV higher relative to
the gs singlet. The higher singlet states are at 3.48, 3.6, and 4.21
eV with a reasonable transition dipole moment probability. T1 lies below S1 and the crucial ΔST is
0.81 eV for acenapthylene. The TDDFT results show the singlet excited
states are at 3.08, 3.84, and 4.15 eV. ΔST obtained
through TDDFT is 1.94 eV, which is higher than the value obtained
in the model Hamiltonian method. We later on compare the calculated
singlet excited state values with experimental values for acenapthylene.

The PPP
and TDDFT results for cyclopenta-acenapthylene (c) are
listed in Table 2.
We can compare those results with its isomer pyracylene in Table 1. Unlike the case
of pyracylene, cyclopenta-acenapthylene (c) shows the
lowest singlet absorption at 1.47 eV followed by two more absorptions
at 2.7 and 3.08 eV with reasonable transition probabilities in the
model PPP calculation. So, it can absorb solar radiation ranging from
the visible to NIR region. The spin gap for this system is small,
1.2 eV, and consequently, ΔST is 0.27 eV for cyclopenta-acenapthylene
(c). So, the calculation reveals that cyclopenta-acenapthylene
(c) would be a better choice over the pyracylene (b) isomer for potential application in organic solar cells
and also in improving the efficiency of an electroluminescent device.
The TDDFT results show comparatively higher singlet excitations at
2.1, 2.88, and 3.62 eV. The TDDFT spin gap is 1.13 eV, which is comparable
with the spin gap of 1.2 eV obtained in the model Hamiltonian technique.

In Table 3, the
excitation results of the isomers of dicyclopentacyclooctenes (DCPCO), e, f, and cycloocta-pentalene (g), are listed. We compare the calculated results of these isomers
with DCPCO (d). In Table 3, the lowest singlet absorption for DCPCO isomer (e) is at 1.17 eV calculated through the PPP model. The higher
absorption occurs at 1.81 and 2.18 eV, respectively. The lowest singlet–triplet
energy gap ΔST is only 0.12 eV as compared to the
value 0.09 eV, calculated for DCPCO (d). The TDDFT results
for DCPCO (d) showed that the lowest triplet (T1) state lies 0.18 eV below S0, indicating the triplet
state (T1) is the gs, which is completely different from
the PPP model calculation where gs is always S0. The singlet
absorptions are comparatively higher at 2.15, 2.43, and 2.67 eV.

The lowest singlet absorption of the other DCPCO isomer
(f) is at 0.62 eV and interestingly the lowest triplet
energy
gap (spin gap) is nearly 0.63 eV. So, the magnitude of ΔST is very low, nearly 0.01 eV, for the case of DCPCO isomer
(f). The calculated ΔST (0.01 eV) is
the lowest amongst the isomers of DCPCO. The singlet excitations based
on TDDFT give comparatively higher absorption values at 1.197, 2.52,
and 2.66 eV. The spin gap is at 1.196 eV and the important ΔST is nearly zero, which is similar to what obtained through the model
Hamiltonian calculation. Both the model Hamiltonian and TDDFT results
indicate ΔST to be very small for DCPCO isomer (f). Thus, DCPCO isomer (f) could be useful in
electroluminescent device applications. Finally, we concentrate on
the case of cycloocta-pentalene (g), shown in Figure 1. The calculated
lowest three singlet absorptions are at 0.43, 1.22, and 1.81 eV, and
the spin gap is at 0.52 eV. So, ΔST for cycloocta-pentalene
molecule (g) is nearly 0.09 eV. The calculation based
on TDDFT shows singlet absorption values at 1.16, 2.49, and 2.65 eV
with the spin gap at 1.18 eV, and ΔST is very low
at 0.01 eV. Both the model Hamiltonian and the TDDFT approach show
very small ΔST values. Cycloocta-pentalene could
also be regarded as an isomer of DCPCO. So, we conclude that all of
the isomers of DCPCO exhibit very small ΔST, and
among them, DCPCO isomer (f) showed the lowest.

In the model Hamiltonian approach, except for the case of the pyracylene
molecule, the calculated ΔST values for the others
vary from 0.01 to 0.48 eV. Among them, the ΔST values
of DCPCO isomers (f) and cycloocta-pentalene (g) are 0.01 and 0.09 eV, respectively. The TDDFT method also shows
nearly zero ΔST for DCPCO isomer (f)
and 0.2 eV for cycloocta-pentalene (g). So, beside pyracylene,
the rest of the molecules could support the idea of RISC. The isomers
of DCPCO (d, e, f, and cycloocta-pentalene
(g)) are very promising in this respect. In addition
to that, the PPP calculation also reveals that except for acenapthylene
(a) and pyracylene (b), the lowest singlet
absorption ranges from 0.43 to 1.47 eV which is suitable for absorbing
solar radiation in the NIR region.

For a better understanding
of the energy ordering of all of these
molecules discussed above, we summarize the energy states in the singlet
and triplet subspaces obtained from the model PPP Hamiltonian in Figures 2 and 3.

Figure 2 Low-lying energy ordering obtained using the PPP model Hamiltonian
method in the singlet and triplet subspaces of acenapthylene (a), pyracylene (b), and cyclopenta-acenapthylene
(c), respectively.

Figure 3 Low-lying energy ordering obtained using the PPP model Hamiltonian
method in the singlet and triplet subspaces of isomers of dicyclo-pentacyclo-octenes
(DCPCO) (d), (e), (f), and
cycloocta-pentalene (COP) (g), respectively.

2.1 D–A Substituted Systems
The
optical absorption of these small CP-PAH molecules can be further
modulated with proper D–A substitution at suitable atomic positions
in experiments. Theoretically, we also calculated the low-lying excitations
of the above-described systems with D–A substitution and the
effect of D and A group is simulated by introducing an atomic site
or orbital energies at the atomic positions at which these groups
substitute the hydrogen atom. A negative site energy (ϵ) simulates
the A group, whereas a positive value induces the effect of a D group.
The low-lying singlet excitations are sensitive to the effect of D–A
substitution in conjugated systems. The atomic positions of the D–A
substitutions are depicted in Figure 1 for all of the molecules discussed above. A nonzero
value of ϵ provides the strength of substitution. First, we
plotted the variation of optical gap and ΔST for
acenapthylene as a function of |ϵ| in Figure 4. In the case of acenapthylene, D–A
substitution does not show any effect on the ΔST value
up to maximum |ϵ| = 5 eV, however a slight increase in the value
of the optical gap was noticed. We next concentrate on comparing the
optical excitations in pyracylene (b) and its isomer,
cyclopenta-acenapthylene (c). The suitable positions
for substitution are depicted in Figure 1. We summarized the results in a plot wherein
the variation in optical gap is shown as a function of the magnitude
of D–A strength in Figure 5. Comparing the low-lying excitations in pyracylene
(b) and cyclopenta-acenapthylene (c), we
found that the optical gap in these systems is sensitive to D–A
substitution. The effect of D–A strength (|ϵ|) in reducing
the optical gap is more pronounced in pyracylene (a)
than in its isomer cyclopenta-acenapthylene (c). The
optical gap of 2.6 eV can be reduced to 1.4 eV for an |ϵ| value
up to 5 eV, whereas for cyclopenta-acenapthylene (c),
the gap is reduced from 1.4 to 1.2 eV only. It should also to be noted
that ΔST is nearly same over the entire range of
D–A substitution (0.5–0.3 eV) for both molecules.

of optical and ΔST gap as a function
of D–A strength (|ϵ|) for acenapthylene.

Figure 5 Variation of optical and ΔST gap as a
function
of D–A strength (|ϵ|) for pyracylene (b)
and cyclopenta-acenapthaylene (c).

In the case of DCPCO and its isomers (d–g in Figure 1), the effect of D–A substitution on the optical and ΔST energy gap is summarized in Figure 6. We found that the value of optical gap
is smaller when |ϵ| = 0, and with increasing D–A strength,
the value of optical gap increases as a function of |ϵ|, except
for the DCPCO (e) isomer. In the case of the DCPCO isomer
(e), we see a decrease in the gap with an increase in
|ϵ| from 1.17 to 0.84 eV. So, the modulation of optical gap
as function of D–A strength is possible for these isomers.
The calculated lowest singlet–triplet (ΔST) energy gap is very interesting in these isomers. Figure 6 shows that the initial ΔST is nearly 0.1 eV for |ϵ| = 0 for the DCPCO isomers
(d, e, f), except it is 0.01
eV for cycloocta-pentalene (g). The ΔST values of the DCPCO isomers d, e, f can be modulated with |ϵ| strength and almost vanish
(0.03 eV for e, f and 0.003 eV for d) at |ϵ| = 4 eV. So, the model Hamiltonian calculation
shows that the DCPCO isomers are very good candidates for RISC. In
the case of cycloocta-pentalene (g), we found a small
increment (0.01–0.18 eV) of ΔST with an |ϵ|
strength up to 5 eV.

function

2.2 Comparison
with Experimental Observations
The calculated singlet absorption
values obtained from the full
CI and TDDFT techniques were compared with existing absorption maxima
observed experimentally for the above molecules reported in the literature.
The calculated lowest singlet absorption for pyracylene (Table 1) at 2.61 eV with
a nonzero transition dipole moment (0.26 Debye) obtained through a
model Hamiltonian is in very good agreement with the experimental
value of 2.56 eV in hexane solution.35 The
lowest singlet absorption was calculated to be 2 eV with zero oscillator
strength using the TDDFT methodology. We could observe that the full
CI results within the PPP model Hamiltonian give better agreement
with experiments over the TDDFT results of the lowest singlet optical
absorption in the case of pyracylene (b). In the case
of acenapthylene, the absorption at 4.1 eV found experimentally is
in very good agreement with the model Hamiltonian value (4.21 eV)
and TDDFT-based result (4.16 eV).36 The
2,7-di(terbutyl) derivative of the DCPCO (d) isomer is
shown in Figure 1.
It exhibits the longest wavelength absorption maxima (λ = 1375
(0.9) nm (eV)).37 The calculated optical
gap at highest D–A strength (|ϵ| = 5 eV) was found to
be 0.7 eV, which is very close to the experimentally found absorption
(0.9 eV) reported for the 2,7-di(tert-butyl) derivative of the DCPCO
isomer. The TDDFT result of the optical absorption (1.0 eV) of DCPCO
(d) is also in good agreement with experiments. The synthesis
and optical absorption study of DCPCO isomer (e) was
reported by Oda et al.37 The UV/vis spectra
of DCPCO isomer (e) shows the longest wavelength at 767
(1.61) nm (eV). The calculated value of optical gap of the above molecule
is nearly 1.17 eV (0.73 Debye), whereas the TDDFT results show absorption
at a comparatively higher energy of 2.67 eV with nonzero oscillator
strength.

3 Conclusions
The
low-lying excited states of seven CP-PAHs, namely, acenapthylene,
isomers of pyracylene, cycloocta-pentalene, and dicyclo-pentacyclo-octenes
(DCPCO) were studied within a model PPP Hamiltonian as well as using
the TDDFT technique. Calculations employed relevant symmetries to
target the desired excited states in the model Hamiltonian approach.
The calculated optical gap of the above molecules ranges from 0.43
to 1.4 eV, except for pyracylene and acenapthylene, indicating the
possibility of their applicability in harvesting NIR region solar
radiation. The calculated lowest singlet (S1) and lowest
triplet (T1) excitation energy gap (ΔST) is comparatively smaller ranging from 0.01 to 0.48 eV, except for
pyracylene, showing that they can be used to improve the efficiency
of OLEDs and photovoltaic devices through RISC. The singlet optical
absorption of pyracylene and acenapthylene are in very good agreement
with experimental observations. The optical excitations in D–A
substituted the dicyclo-pentacyclo-octenes (DCPCO) isomers agree well
with experiments. Thus, calculation of the low-lying excited states
of the above molecules shows that these are very promising for harvesting
solar energy at the NIR region and can be useful in enhancing the
electroluminescent efficiency in light-emitting devices.

4 Computational Approach
All of the conjugated molecules shown
in Figure 1 obey the
4n + 2 (n integer) rule except acenapthylene.
Acenapthylene and
pyracylene C60 fragments. For a wide range of π-conjugated molecules
and polymers involving sp2 carbon backbone, it has been
shown earlier that the PPP model Hamiltonian provides a physically
consistent and numerically accurate description. This correlated electron
model Hamiltonian for π-conjugated systems restricts the orbital
basis to just pz orbitals. The PPP Hamiltonian
includes the explicit long-range electron–electron interactions
along with the on-site Hubbard interaction (U).26−29 The model Hamiltonian is written as 1  where ai,σ† (ai,σ) creates
(annihilates) a π-electron in the pz orbital on atom site i with spin σ. ni = ∑σni,σ is the total
number of electrons on atom i, ϵi is termed as the orbital energy or site energy at
atomic site i, and zi are the local chemical potentials, which is 1 for
carbon. tij is the hopping
matrix element or transfer integrals between the bonded pair of atoms i and j. The Hubbard Ui is the on-site electron–electron
repulsion and Vij is
termed as the intersite Coulomb interaction potential parametrized
in Ohno interpolation scheme.30 2  The transfer integrals tij for the carbon atoms are taken to be 2.4
eV and the on-site Hubbard repulsion is UC = 11.26 eV. The value of orbital or site energy ϵi at atomic site i is taken to be
uniform as all atoms are carbon. We considered ϵi to be zero for carbon atoms and can simulate the
effect of D (A) substitution at any atomic position by changing the
values to positive (negative) numbers, respectively. The magnitude
of the D (A) strength in this model simulates the strength of D (A)
substitution. Only the two molecules (b) and (d) in Figure 1 possess
inherent D2h symmetry.
However, D2h symmetry
cannot be employed for the rest of the molecules in Figure 1. The PPP model Hamiltonian
described above conserves the total spin. So, spin symmetry will reduce
the computational effort by partitioning the singlet and triplet states.
For systems possessing D2h symmetry, the ground (A) and lowest dipole allowed
excited states (B) are in even spin parity subspace
and they are singlet. The dipole-forbidden, two-photon state 2A also has even spin parity. On the other hand, the triplet
states lie in the odd parity subspace. In the case of the molecules
without D2h symmetry,
we calculated the gs and few low-lying excited states in the singlet
and triplet manifold. In any case, spin symmetry can be employed to
calculate the ground and low-lying excited states in singlet and triplet
subspaces separately. We employed the diagrammatic valence bond (DVB)
basis as the spin adapted basis for those systems discussed.38,39 The resultant basis is nonorthogonal but linearly independent. So,
the Hamiltonian matrix in this basis will be nonsymmetric. Rettrup’s
modification to Davidson’s algorithm was implemented to obtain
the few low-lying excited states.31,32 The PPP Hamiltonian
is expressed in a complete basis, so the results obtained are exact
within the PPP model. Such a full CI space grows exponentially with
system size. All of those molecules in Figure 1 consist of 14 carbon atoms except acenapthylene,
which has 12 carbon atoms. So, it is possible to study the ground
and low-lying excited states of these molecules in full CI space.
The advantage of using the PPP model Hamiltonian for the above small
molecules is that it can be diagonalizable in a complete full CI basis.

The gs geometries of the molecules shown in Figure 1 were optimized based on a DFT method implemented
in Gaussian 09 using a B3LYP exchange-correlational functional with
a 6-311g++(d,p) basis set.33,34 The optimized geometries
of these CP-PAHs were used to carry out full CI calculations using
a DVB basis through a model Hamiltonian approach. In addition to the
full CI calculations, we also carried out TDDFT calculations to compare
results from the two methodologies. The TDDFT calculations were carried
out using a 6-311g++(d,p) basis with a B3LYP exchange-correlational
functional.
