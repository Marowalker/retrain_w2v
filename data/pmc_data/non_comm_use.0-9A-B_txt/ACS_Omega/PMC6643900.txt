Adsorption
of seven 5-membered N-heterocycles on B/N/BN-doped graphene
(with coronene as a model system) has been studied using density functional
theory (DFT). The geometry of the complexes validated the involvement
of both π···π stacking and N–H···π
interaction in the adsorption process. The stability of the complexes
is measured in terms of stabilization energy, and the results suggested
that the complexes are stable enough (stabilization energies are in
the range of 7.61–14.77 kcal mol–1). Studies
confirmed the stability of complexes in the solvent phase too irrespective
of the dielectric of the solvent. Dispersive force is the major mode
of interaction in stabilizing the complexes. Natural bond orbital
analysis indicated a small contribution from electrostatic and covalent
interactions. Thermochemical analysis revealed that the complexation
is exothermic in nature and favorable at a lower temperature. Adsorption
of N-heterocycles exerts a nominal impact on the electronic properties
of the undoped/doped graphene. The study presents a simple approach
to introduce an arbitrary functionality to undoped/doped graphene
by preserving its electronic properties.

1 Introduction
Graphene
is a tri-coordinated two-dimensional (2D) material, which
possesses extraordinary thermal, mechanical, electrical, and optical
properties.1 These properties have triggered
tremendous interest in scientific communities toward its application
in the field of nanophotonics, nanoelectronics, nanocomposites, biosensors,
drug delivery, and many more.2−5 Apart from these, different groups are also associated
with its application in environment pollution remediation, which is
one of the most pressing and current issues.6 To have full potential of the aforesaid applications, adequate procedures
and approaches are desired for exploring graphene in nanotechnology
and material sciences.7

Functionalization
of graphene is one of the most commonly used
approaches that led to modification of the nanomaterial for its application
in multiple areas.3,7,8 Although functionalization
is executed by both covalent and noncovalent modes of interaction,
the latter is preferred because it does not affect the extended π-conjugation
of the graphene sheet to a significant extent (useful properties remain
intact).9,10 In addition to this, noncovalent interaction
is impermanent and a comparatively simple adsorption/desorption process
introduces flexibility in treating the adsorbent.9

Recent years have witnessed a number of studies on
the adsorption
of aromatic molecules on the surface of graphene sheets.9−12 Such interaction is also considered to be a suitable model for interaction
between two graphene surfaces.11 Apart
from this, interaction with aromatic moieties has also been explored
in tailoring the electronic structure of graphene sheets.13 A number of theoretical efforts have been focused
on the interaction of aromatic hydrocarbons (linear and fused) with
graphene sheets.14−16 The presence of heteroatoms or substituents on the
aromatic moieties is reported to have some impact on the adsorption
energies.9,11,17,18 For example, interaction between hexaflurobenzene
and graphene is significantly stronger than that between benzene and
graphene.11 Similarly, compared with benzene,
pyridine and pyridazine are adsorbed preferably on graphene surface.9 Moreover, substituents present on aromatic moieties
also enhance the interaction with graphene.17,18

N-Heterocycles are central to the chemical reactions that
occur
in all organisms and are the key constituents of both RNA and DNA.19 In addition to these, N-heterocycles are also
present in coenzymes that mediate metabolic transformations.19 Adsorption of the N-heterocycles is of notable
interest because N-heterocycles like pyridine are quite useful from
drug delivery and diagnostic points of view.20 5-Membered N-heterocycles are also useful in different areas. A
pyrrole ring is important from the viewpoint of porphyrin and corrin
macrocycles.19 Similarly, aromatic compounds
bearing imidazole and triazole moieties are important from the perspective
of fluorescence and DNA studies.21 Apart
from this, imidazole and triazole compounds are important from both agrochemical
and pharmaceutical viewpoints.22 Tetrazole
is acidic in nature and has been used in drugs as a replacement of
-COOH groups with no loss of activity.23 However, compounds with four or more N atoms are explosive in nature.
For example, pentazole is highly explosive. Apart from their usefulness,
some of these heterocyclic compounds and their derivatives are also
toxic in nature.24

Even though adsorption
of aromatic moieties on graphene is extensively
studied, reports on adsorption of N-heterocycles on B/N/BN-doped graphene
are relatively scarce. To the best of our knowledge, only Petrushenko
et al. have reported the adsorption of pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazine,
pyridazine, and 1,3,5 triazine on a graphenelike boron nitride–carbon
heterostructure (GBNCH).9 This stimulated
the interest of studying the adsorption of 5-membered N-heterocycles
on B/N/BN-doped graphene systems. In addition, doping disturbs the
π-electron delocalization and introduces polarity in the molecule
and, therefore, might improve its adsorptive capacity for various
molecules at interfacial regions. Therefore, it becomes imperative
to have some understanding on the interactions between B/N/BN-doped
graphene and N-heterocycles.

Here, physical adsorption of a
series of isoelectronic 5-membered
N-heterocycles on B/N/BN-doped graphene is studied in the light of
density functional theory (DFT). The following N-heterocycles are
considered for the study: pyrrole, imidazole, pyrazole, 1,2,3-triazole,
1,2,4-triazole, tetrazole, and pentazole. However, the choice of a
suitable model graphene system is crucial. It should be so chosen
that it is practicable from the viewpoint of computational demand
and provides results that are consistent with the experimental observations. Considering these and in line with the literature, coronene is employed
as a model graphene system.25−30 To scrutinize the effect of the size of the considered graphene
model system on the adsorption of heterocycles, four larger graphene
model systems, viz., C42H16, C48H18, C54H18, and C66H20 are also considered and their interactions with pyrrole and imidazole
are studied as representative cases. Substitutional doping of the
B/N/BN unit on the ring at the center of coronene is taken into consideration.
Furthermore, the effects of complexation on HOMO energy (energy of
the highest occupied molecular orbital, EHOMO), HOMO–LUMO gap (energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital, ELUMO), and UV–visible
absorption spectra are studied. Apart from these, the number of dopants
is increased from one to three and its effect on the aforesaid properties
is also studied. Furthermore, effects of solvent dielectric on the
stability of the complexes are also scrutinized. Our study is expected
to reveal the role of dopant along with the role of N atom present
on adsorbent in the adsorption process.

2 Results
and Discussion
For the study, substitutional doping is considered
in coronene
with B (electron-deficient), N (electron-rich), and BN (isoelectronic with CC) units bearing no
charges. In this article, undoped/doped coronene is symbolized as
Cor with dopants indicated within the parenthesis. For example, B-doped
coronene is represented as Cor(B) and its complexes with
considered N-heterocyclic compounds such as pyrrole (Pyr), imidazole
(Im), pyrazole (Pz), 1,2,3-triazole (123-tria), 1,2,4-triazole (124-tria),
tetrazole (Tetra), and pentazole (Penta) are represented as Cor(B)-Pyr, Cor(B)-Im, Cor(B)-Pz, Cor(B)-123-tria, Cor(B)-124-tria, Cor(B)-Tetra, and Cor(B)-Penta.

Electrostatic potential
of a system is a physical property, and
it reveals the resultant spatial effect of nuclei and electrons and
thereby provides useful information in predicting the possibility
of interactions between two moieties.43 Hence, molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) surfaces of undoped/doped
Cor and the considered N-heterocyclic systems are obtained and are
depicted in Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1, the charge distribution over the surface of the considered N-heterocycles
varies depending upon the position and number of N atoms present in
the heterocycles. The red area in the ESP surfaces stands for the
electron-rich (negatively charged) region, whereas the blue area represents
a relatively electron-deficient (positively charged) region. In the
case of N-heterocycles, the region around the H atom attached to the
N atom is relatively electron-deficient, whereas the region around
the N atom with a lone pair is electron-rich, Figure 1a–g. Similarly, there exists a negatively
charged region over the surface of Cor (Figure 1h); however, upon doping, irrespective of
its nature, the charge distribution over the surface of Cor is perturbed, Figure 1i–n. Variation
in the charged region over the surface of N-heterocyclic systems and
the undoped/doped Cor surface suggests the possibility of multiple
modes of interactions between the considered moieties and thereby
would influence the adsorption process.

level of theory.

Again, doping influences
the delocalized π-electrons (aromaticity)
and therefore is expected to influence the possible π-interactions
(π···π, N–H···π,
C–H···π, lone pair···π
interactions) to a certain extent. Hence, aromaticity at the site
of complexation is estimated using the HOMA index. According to the
literature, a system with HOMA > 0.5 is aromatic, HOMA < 0 is
antiaromatic,
and for the range 0 < HOMA < 0.5, the system is non-aromatic.31,32 Among the considered systems, Cor is the most aromatic with HOMA
= 0.87. Upon doping, variation in HOMA values is observed depending
on the nature and number of dopants. Except Cor(3B), all
of the doped Cor are aromatic in nature, and the calculated HOMA values
for Cor(B), Cor(3B), Cor(N), Cor(3N), Cor(BN), and Cor(3BN) are 0.69,
0.08, 0.80, 0.69, 0.65, and 0.85, respectively. Suitability of the
HOMA index is validated by estimating the HOMA values for C6H6 (0.99) and B3N3H6 (0.94)
as reference and comparing the results with the reported values.32 The observed variation in aromaticity predicts
the key role of the dopant in adsorption of the N-heterocyclic system
on the undoped/doped Cor surface.

The ESP surface and aromaticity
predict the viability of adsorption
of N-heterocycles on undoped/doped Cor where doping is anticipated
to have a significant role in the stability of the complex. Recent
studies also confirmed suitability of the ESP surface in predicting
the likelihood of interaction between two moieties involving similar
type of interactions.9,11

2.1 Geometry
of the Complexes
The presence
of substituent plays a key role in controlling the geometry and properties
of the complexes involving π···π stacking.33 From chemical intuition, the presence of heteroatom
in a π-conjugated system would also influence the geometry of
the studied complexes, measured in terms interlayer separation (dπ···π, distance between
the Bq atoms placed at the ring center at the site of complexation).
Apart from this, interlayer separation and degree of π-orbital
interaction are also crucial from the viewpoint of an organic semiconductor.34 Although the considered heterocycles possibly
would interact via C–H···π, N–H···π,
and lone pair···π interactions, due to favorable
and maximum π-orbital overlap, π···π
stacking, i.e., face-to-face orientation between the systems, is taken into consideration.
The optimized geometries of the complexes formed by Cor and Cor(3B) with the considered N-heterocycles are shown in Figure 2 as representative
cases, and the interlayer separation between the monomers (in the
complexes) is presented in Table 1. Referring to Figure 2, the Cor moiety and the involved N-heterocycles are
not exactly over the center of the ring, i.e., the N-heterocyclic
compound is displaced to a certain extent with the interlayer separation
of 3.37–3.52 Å. Displacement of the N-heterocyclic compound
is also observed for the complexes with doped Cor irrespective of
the nature of dopants, possessing variable interlayer separation (3.21–3.94
Å), Table 1. Similar
displacement of the monomers is also reported on benzene dimers formed
via π···π stacking.35 The observed interlayer separation is in good agreement
with the reported values for adsorption of aromatic molecules on graphene
via π···π stacking interaction.9−12 Petrushenko et al. have reported the interlayer separation within
the range of 3.17–3.34 Å for similar type of complexes
involving GBNCH.9 A distance of ∼3.40
Å is also reported for adsorption of substituted pyridine on
graphene surface.12 On increasing the number
of dopants from 1 to 3, the interlayer separation decreases. For example,
for the complexes involving Cor(3B), Cor(3N), and Cor(3BN), the interlayer separation is less (3.21–3.39
Å) than that for the complexes with Cor, Cor(B), Cor(N), and Cor(BN) (3.35–3.62 Å), Table 1. Therefore, a stronger
interaction is anticipated between the N-heterocycle and Cor(3B), Cor(3N), and Cor(3BN). Unlike the benzene
dimer (parallel displaced), considered N-heterocycles are not exactly
parallel to the molecular plane of undoped/doped Cor (slanting is
observed). This is also expected from the unsymmetrical charge distribution
in the concerned N-heterocycles and undoped/doped Cor. In addition
to this, the considered N-heterocycles possess lone pair electrons
on the N atom (except in Pyr) that do not contribute to the delocalized
π-electrons and experience additional interaction with undoped/doped
Cor. As the number of lone pairs increased, such interactions between
the systems are expected to be stronger and may result in more slanting.
For example, higher slanting is observed in the case of complexes
involving tetrazole and pentazole irrespective of the nature and number
of dopants, Figure 2. The literature also confirmed the slanting of N-heterocycles on
interaction with an aromatic moiety.9,12 Petrushenko
et al. have attributed this slanting to the dipole moment (μ)
of the heterocycles.9 It is seen that the
dipole moment of Pyr (μ = 1.95 D) is the lowest among the chosen
set of N-heterocycles, which exhibits minimum slanting in the complexes,
whereas for Tetra (μ = 5.66 D) and Penta (μ = 4.15 D),
the slanting is maximum, Figure 2. Again, the dipole moments of Im, Pz, 123-tria, and
124-tria are 3.95, 2.44, 4.71, and 5.99 D, respectively. Although
124-tria possesses the maximum μ value, the slanting is comparatively
less than that in Tetra and Penta, Figure 2. This indicates that the dipole moment is
not the only criterion that controls the slanting in geometries of
the considered systems.

Apart from interlayer separation, N–H···π
distances in the complexes are also measured (dN–H···π, distance between the H
atom and Bq atom placed at the center of the arene ring closest to
it) and are shown in Table 1. The dN–H···π varies (2.44–3.33 Å) depending upon the nature of the
N-heterocycles. The observed results are in line with the reported
values for the N–H···π interaction.36 However, the earlier literature on adsorption
of N-heterocycles did not report anything about the involvement of
N–H···π interactions.10 In the case of complexes with doped Cor, dN–H···π is decreased with
an increase in the number of N in the heterocyclic ring (especially
for Tetra and Penta), suggesting the key role of N–H···π
interaction in stabilizing their complexes, Table 1. For example, in the case of complexes involving
Cor(3N), dN–H···π decreases in the following order: Cor(3N)-Im (2.90) >
Cor(3N)-Pz (2.78) > Cor(3N)-Pyr (2.77) >
Cor(3N)-123-tria (2.75) > Cor(3N)-124-tria
(2.73) >
Cor(3N)-Tetra (2.65) > Cor(3N)-Penta (2.44);
values are in angstrom. The observed slanting in geometries of the
complexes can be attributed to the simultaneous involvement of π···π,
N–H···π, and lone pair···π
interactions. Voloshina et al. have also attributed the slating of
pyridine on graphene surface to the simultaneous involvement of π···π
and lone pair···π interactions between the two.12

It is to be mentioned that adsorption
of the N-heterocycles does
not lead to notable changes on the geometries of the undoped/doped
Cor except for Cor(3B). In the complexes with Cor(3B), significant distortion in the molecular plane (buckling) of Cor(3B) is observed (Figures 2h–n) upon complexation. This is probably due
to the presence of larger B atoms (three longer B–C bond) in
the ring of the Cor(3B) system. Also, the process of complexation
does not bring about any significant (<0.005 Å) changes in
the individual bond length in the ring at the site of complexation,
indicative of π-interaction. However, complex formation with
Cor(3B) brought about comparatively larger changes in B-C
bond distances (up to 0.01 Å) along with its molecular plane.
Studies on geometries of the complexes thus suggest the simultaneous
involvement of π···π stacking and N–H···π
interaction in the adsorption process.

2.2 Stabilization
Energies of the Complexes
Aromatic stacking or π···π
stacking
is intuitively repulsive, and such interaction is stabilized by key
contributions from dispersive, electrostatic, and solvophobic interactions.37 Although the geometry of the complexes indicated
the presence of N–H···π interaction along
with π···π stacking, accurate estimation
of these interactions is challenging. The coupled cluster approach
with perturbative triples on extrapolation to the complete basis set
limit (CCSD(T)-CBS) is reported to produce results consistent with
experimental observation.38 Nevertheless,
its computational demand has limited the use of the CCSD-(T)-CBS method
to smaller systems only. Moreover, the second-order Møller–Plesset
(MP2) perturbation theory is computationally less expensive (compared
with CCSD(T)), but its accuracy is reported to be dependent on the
type of basis set used.39 Hobza et al.
suggested the use of the MP2/cc-pVTZ level of theory for this purpose,
which would also be prohibitively expensive for the considered systems.40 DFT methods are computationally more convenient
than CCSD(T) and MP2 calculations and hence, in this study, DFT functionals
are used. However, proper selection of the functional (dispersion-corrected)
and basis set is important for accurate estimation of π···π
stacking.39 For this purpose, MP2/cc-pVTZ
calculations are performed on the complexes formed by undoped/B/N/BN-doped
Cor with Pyr (as the representative case) and the results are compared
with those obtained from various DFT functionals and basis sets, as
shown in Table 2. It
is seen that compared to the results obtained with the MP2/cc-pVTZ
calculation (shown within parentheses in the second column of Table 2), the results produced
by the ωB97-XD functional are closer than those obtained from
the M06-2X level calculation. This validates the suitability of the
ωB97-XD functional over the M06-2X functional for studying the
complexes. Recently, ωB97-XD functional is also used for studying
the adsorption of aromatic molecules on graphene.11,41 To find out the appropriate basis set, stabilization energies of
the complexes are obtained at the ωB97-XD/6-311++G(d,p), ωB97-XD/6-31++G(d,p),
ωB97-XD/cc-pVTZ, and ωB97-XD/def2TZVPP levels of theories,
given in Table 2. Considering
the result obtained from the MP2/cc-pVTZ calculation as the standard,
for the complex of undoped Cor, the ωB97-XD/6-311++G(d,p) level
of theory produces more comparable result (differs by 0.91 kcal mol–1). Similarly, for the complexes with B-doped, N-doped,
and BN-doped pyrene, ωB97-XD/cc-PVTZ (varies by 0.07 kcal mol–1), ωB97-XD/def2TZVPP (varies by 0.01 kcal mol–1), and ωB97-XD/6-311++G(d,p) (varies by 0.88
kcal mol–1) levels of theories, respectively, produce
results that are in close agreement with the MP2/cc-pVTZ calculation.
Therefore, with a bit of compromise to the accuracy and considering
the computational cost, use of the ωB97-XD/6-311++G(d,p) level
of theory for geometry optimization is not at all a bad choice (varies
by <0.92 kcal mol–1 from that obtained with MP2
calculation).

a SE values obtained from optimization.

b SE values obtained from single-point
calculation.

c SE values obtained
from MP2/cc-pVTZ
level of theory.

The SE
values calculated at the ωB97-XD/6-311++G(d,p) level
of theory (in gas phase) are provided in Table 2. Depending on the nature of heterocycles
involved in complexation, the SE value varies in the range of 7.61–14.77
kcal mol–1, and complexes are expected to be moderately
stable. For example, in the case of undoped Cor, the SE values decrease
in the order Cor-124-tria (9.67) > Cor-Tetra (9.41) > Cor-123-tria
(9.24) > Cor-Pyr (9.07) > Cor-Pz (8.98) > Cor-Im (8.59) >
Cor-Penta
(8.35); values are in kcal mol–1. The observed SE
values are in good agreement with the reported values.9,10,12 Zarudnev et al. have reported
the SE value of 7.90 kcal mol–1 for adsorption of
Im on graphene (obtained at the M05-2X/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory)
surface.10 Although Im and Pz are isomeric/isoelectronic,
SE values are relatively higher for Cor-Pz complexes (which may be
attributed to the higher contribution from the N–H···π
interaction, as evident from the N–H···π
distance). This validates the importance of the position of N in the
heterocycles in stabilizing the complexes. Similar results are also
observed for complexes with 123-tria and 124-tria. This also suggests
lower stability of the complexes formed by the N-heterocyclic compound
where N is present adjacent to each other. Again, the Cor-Penta complex
possesses lowest SE values, which may be attributed to the smaller
π···π contribution (maximum slanting) in
stabilizing the complexes. Upon doping, the SE values, i.e., the stability
of the complexes, increase irrespective of the nature of dopants for
most of the cases, Table 2. For example, the SE values for the complexes involving Pyr
follow the following order: Cor(3B)-Pyr (14.68) > Cor(3N)-Pyr (12.60) > Cor(3BN)-Pyr (11.45) >
Cor(N)-Pyr (9.94) > Cor(B)-Pyr (9.62) ≈
Cor(BN)-Pyr (9.61) > Cor-Pyr (9.07); values are in kcal
mol–1. Apart from this, with an increase in the
number
of dopants, the SE values are further increased, Table 2. Even though the above order
is not true for all of the heterocycles, the SE is always higher when
the number of dopants is increased from 1 to 3. Like undoped Cor,
the complexes formed by doped Cor with Penta possess the lowest SE
values except in the case of the Cor(BN)-Penta complex,
which possesses the SE of 10.63 kcal mol–1. Thus,
doping facilitates the adsorption process and thereby enhances the
stability of the complexes. Even though the literature suggested the
relationship between the SE values and dipole moment of the N-heterocycles,
the obtained results do not establish such relationship between the
two parameters (neither with the dipole moment of undoped/doped Cor
nor with that of N-heterocycles).9

To scrutinize the effect of functionals and basis sets on the stability
of the complexes, SEs are calculated at different levels of theories,
and the results are shown in Table 2. The estimated SE values differ by some extent depending
upon the functional employed for the study. For instance, use of the
ωB97-XD functional estimates higher SEs (by 1.00–3.00
kcal mol–1) of the complexes compared to those from
the M06-2X functional. Moreover, SEs estimated with the 6-31++G(d,p)
basis set are marginally lower (<0.25 kcal mol–1) than those obtained with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. Addition
of extra diffuse function leads to a nominal impact on the SEs of
the complexes, Table 2. For example, SE values for the Cor-Pyr complex are 9.07 and 8.87
kcal mol–1 obtained, respectively, at ωB97-XD/6-311++G(d,p)
and ωB97-XD/6-31++G(d,p) levels of theory. On the other hand,
the SE values calculated with cc-pVTZ and def2TZVPP basis sets in
combination with the ωB97-XD functional are lower (up to 0.66
kcal mol–1) as compared to those with the ωB97-XD/6-311++G(d,p)
level of theory. For instance, the SE values for the Cor-Pyr complex
are 9.07, 8.50, and 8.46 kcal mol–1 obtained with
6-311++G(d,p), cc-pVTZ, and def2TZVPP basis sets in association with
the ωB97-XD functional. Thus, apart from the functional, the
choice of a suitable basis set is also crucial. Jacobs et al. have
also suggested the importance of a suitable DFT functional and basis
set for estimating the noncovalent interactions.39

To verify the accuracy of single-point calculations
for estimating
the SEs, the geometries of the complexes formed by undoped Cor (as
the representative case) are re-optimized at the ωB97-XD/cc-pVTZ
level of theory, and the calculated SE values are shown in Table 2 (column 7). The SE
values obtained from re-optimization and single-point calculations
are very close, with SEs obtained from re-optimization being higher
by <0.20 kcal mol–1 only. The results thus validate
the suitability of the used protocol (computationally cheaper) for
scrutinizing the effect of the functional and basis set on the SEs.

To examine the role of solvent phase in the stability of the complexes,
solvent phase calculations are performed in cyclohexane (ch), ethanol
(eth), DMSO and water (wat) as model solvents, represented in Table 3. It is seen that
the presence of solvent phase exerts some impact on the stability
of the complexes. Compared to those in the gas phase, in cyclohexane,
SE values decreased by ∼2.00 kcal mol–1 except
in the case of complexes formed by Cor(3B) and Cor(3N) with Im, Pz, 123-tria, and 124-tria; SE values decreased
up to 7.07 kcal mol–1 (Table 3). In solvents with a higher dielectric (ethanol),
SE values further drop up to 2.58 kcal mol–1 (compared
to those in cyclohexane). However, with a further increase in the
dielectric of the solvent, i.e., in the case of DMSO and water, no
prominent effect on the SEs is observed (<0.10 kcal mol–1, compared to that in ethanol), Table 3. Earlier studies have shown a notable impact of solvents
on SEs of complexes formed through relatively stronger noncovalent
interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and cation···π,
whereas for weaker interactions, such as B–Hb···π,
the effect of solvent is nominal.42,43 Although SE
is decreased in the presence of a solvent phase, the complexes are
stable enough in the solvent phase irrespective of their dielectrics.

To analyze
the size effect, SE values are calculated (optimized)
for the complexes involving Pyr and Im with four relatively larger
graphene model systems with different sizes, viz., C42H16, C48H18, C54H18, and C66H20 (Supporting Information Figure S1). Compared to those of undoped Cor,
the corresponding SE values for the complexes increase by 1.57–2.21
kcal mol–1 upon increasing the size of the considered
graphene sheet. For example, Cor-Pyr possesses an SE value of 9.07
kcal mol–1 and in the case of C42H16-Pyr, C48H18-Pyr, C54H18-Pyr, and C66H20-Pyr complexes, the
SE values are calculated to be 10.64, 10.94, 11.04, and 11.12 kcal
mol–1, respectively. Similarly, the SE value for
the Cor-Im complex is 8.59 kcal mol–1 and SE values
for C42H16-Im, C48H18-Im,
C54H18-Im, and C66H20-Im
complexes are, respectively, 10.48, 10.67, 10.80, and 10.86 kcal mol–1. Therefore, considering the computational demand
and a bit of compromise to the accuracy, use of Cor as a graphene
model system is not at all a bad choice for such study. This model
has also been used in a number of occasions.25−29

For an effective carrier, a feebly weak or
a significantly strong
interaction is unfavorable. However, the SEs obtained for the complexes
are <15.00 kcal mol–1 and therefore it would
be wise to anticipate that N-heterocycles might be effectively adsorbed
and get released suitably from the surface of undoped/doped Cor, i.e.,
graphene. The literature has also indicated the same for systems with
SEs around this range.10,43 In addition, this may also lead
to effective removal of N-heterocycles, leading to environment treatments.

2.3 Nature of Interaction and Charge Transfer
Noncovalent interaction arises from the contribution from a number
of interactions such as electrostatic, induction, exchange, and dispersion
that act either parallely or antiparallely.44 Depending upon the studied systems (presence of substituent, dopants,
etc.) and involved interaction (strong/weak), contributions from each
of these interactions vary. Generally, the nature of π···π
stacking is primarily dispersive along with some contribution from
electrostatic interaction.39,45,46 Because the geometry of the complexes suggested the additional involvement
of N–H···π interaction, it is imperative
to realize the nature of interaction in stabilizing the complexes.

Although qualitative, the nature of involved interaction can be
predicted using appropriate DFT functionals.43,47 As per the literature, this can be achieved by calculating the SEs
of the complexes’ DFT functional that encounters dispersion
interaction along with all other interactions and functionals that
encompass other interactions except the dispersion interaction. A
comparison between these two would qualitatively provide the role
of dispersion interaction. The above protocol is adopted by Li et
al. to have some idea about the nature of B–Hb···π interaction.47 Therefore, a similar protocol is employed for the purpose and single-point
calculation is performed at HF/6-311++G(d,p) (incorporates electrostatic
and covalent interactions) and B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) (includes all interactions
except dispersion interaction) levels of theory. The result is then
compared with the SE values obtained from the optimized geometries
at the ωB97-XD/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory.43 In line with this, SE values are estimated using the Hartree–Fock
(HF) calculation and B3LYP functional in combination with the 6-311++G(d,p)
basis set; the results are shown in Table 4. The SE values estimated from the HF calculation
are mostly negative (repulsive/unfavorable interaction) and thereby
suggesting the inability of electrostatic and covalent interactions
to stabilize the complexes. Like HF, calculation at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
level of theory also gives negative (less negative than for HF) SE
values. Similar results are reported for the benzene dimer with the
B3LYP functional.41 Besides, SE values
calculated at the ωB97-XD/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory are
all positive, indicative of attractive interaction, Table 2. For example, SE values for
the Cor-Pyr complex obtained at HF/6-311++G(d,p), B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p),
and ωB97-XD/6-311++G(d,p) levels of theory are −6.27,
−4.60, and 9.07 kcal mol–1, respectively.
The results thus validate the primary role of dispersive interaction
in stabilizing the complexes, which are in good agreement with the
documented report for π···π stacking.39,45,46

Moreover, qualitative interpretation
about the role of electrostatic
and covalent components can be predicted from the magnitude of charge
transfer (Δq) in the complexation process.47 As a result, natural bond orbital analysis is
performed to calculate the charge at a particular site before and
after complexation [charge transfer is defined as follows: Δq = qo (charge at the pyrrolelike
N atom before complexation) – q (charge at
the same site after complexation)], presented in Table 4. From Δq values, it would be possible to predict whether an interaction is
charge- controlled (electrostatic) or orbital-controlled (covalent).
An interaction with a sufficiently small Δq value is considered to be charge-controlled or electrostatic, whereas
for orbital-controlled or covalent interaction, the Δq value is larger. Table 4 shows variable charge transfer upon complexation depending
upon the nature of both the monomers. For example, Δq values for complexes formed by undoped Cor are significantly
small (<0.003 e–) except with Tetra and Penta
for which relatively higher Δq values (0.0079
and 0.0107 e–) are observed, Table 4. Thus, for Cor-Tetra and Cor-Penta complexes,
the contribution from the covalent component is relatively larger,
whereas for the rest, the electrostatic contribution is comparatively
larger. Similarly, for doped Cor, irrespective of the nature of dopants,
complexes with Tetra and Penta possess higher Δq values (0.0070–0.0170 e–), indicating a
higher covalent contribution, Table 4. Apart from this, most of the complexes formed by
Cor(B), Cor(3B), and Cor(3BN) are
associated with higher Δq values (0.0046–0.0170
e–) irrespective of the considered N-heterocycle
and thereby indicating a higher covalent contribution in their complexes, Table 4. On the other hand,
for complexes formed by doped Cor(N), Cor(3N), and Cor(BN) with Pyr, Im, Pz, 123-tria, and 124-tria,
the electrostatic contribution is large with relatively lower Δq values, Table 4. The literature also suggested the secondary role of electrostatic
interaction in stabilizing the B–Hb···π
interaction with Δq values around 0.002 e–.43,47,48

Therefore, it can be concluded that adsorption of the considered
N-heterocycles is largely stabilized by dispersive interaction with
secondary contribution from both electrostatic and covalent interactions
depending on the natures of dopant and N-heterocycles.

2.4 Thermochemical Analysis
Enthalpy
change upon complexation (ΔH) provides useful
information about the stability of complexes.43 Apart from this, to predict the thermodynamic driving force, ΔH of complexation is estimated (at 298 K); its values are
shown in Table 5. The
estimated ΔH values are all negative (range
from −4.80 to −12.88 kcal mol–1, Table 5), revealing the exothermic
nature of complexation. Moreover, free energy change (ΔG) for the process of complexation is more reliable (comprises
both enthalpy and entropy factors) and has been extensively used for
examining the spontaneity of a process.53 Hence, ΔG values are also estimated (at 298
K) in the gas phase, and the values are provided in Table 5. The ΔG values are positive (0.12–4.49 kcal mol–1) with a few exceptions for which negative ΔG (−0.04 to −2.45 kcal mol–1) values
are observed. Small positive ΔG values can
be attributed to the entropy compensation resulting from complexation.49 Apart from this, higher stability of the corresponding
complexes at a relatively low temperature is also revealed from the
observed ΔG values. Generally, negative ΔG values are common in complexes with stronger interactions
(cation···π, hydrogen bonding, etc.), whereas
positive ΔG values are frequently observed
in the case of complexes with weaker such as B–Hb···π interaction.42,43,49 The thermochemical study indicated that the adsorption
of N-heterocycles is enthalpy-driven with the entropy factor restricting
the spontaneity of the process.

Apart from gas phase, solvent
phase ΔG values
for the complexation are also calculated (at 298 K) by considering
the complexes involving undoped Cor as the representative case. For
this purpose, the geometry of the concerned complexes are re-optimized
in solvent phases (cyclohexane, ethanol, and water), and the calculated
ΔG values are presented in Table 6. Unlike those in the gas phase,
the calculated ΔG values are all positive in
solvent phases. However, it is observed that ΔGsolvent > ΔGgas.
The
difference between ΔGsolvent and
ΔGgas is calculated to be in the
range of 0.04–3.25 kcal mol–1. The results
advocate that the complexation is not spontaneous in solvent phases, Table 6. With the increase
in solvent dielectrics, ΔG increases (becomes
more positive, i.e., ΔGch < ΔGeth < ΔGwat). Although the ΔG value becomes more positive
with an increase in the solvent dielectric, values are not large enough
(<5.0 kcal mol–1) to prohibit the complexation, Table 6. The complexes are
thus expected to be stable at lower temperatures.

2.5 HOMO–LUMO
Perspective and UV–Visible
Absorption Spectra
HOMO energy (EHOMO) provides the electron-donating ability of a species, and in association
with ELUMO, it measures the stability
(HOMO–LUMO gap or ELUMO–EHOMO; half of which is defined as chemical hardness)
of the molecular system and controls the absorption spectra of the
system under consideration.50 Hence, EHOMO and the HOMO–LUMO gap are estimated
using the TD-DFT calculation. For this purpose, the B3LYP hybrid functional
is used in combination with the 6-31++G(d,p) basis set. Zhang et al.
also have validated the use of hybrid functional in predicting the
energies frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs).51 Apart from this, the ability of the B3LYP functional to produce
results that are in close agreement with the experimental results
has also fueled its use for TD-DFT calculations.43 To validate this fact, TD-DFT calculations are performed
on undoped Cor (in THF as experimental result is available in THF)
with B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, ωB97-XD, and M06-2X functionals in association
with the 6-31++G(d,p) basis set and a strong band for each at 306,
275, 271, and 276 nm, respectively. The experimental absorption spectrum
in THF of Cor is reported to be 301 nm, suggesting the suitability
of B3LYP functionals.52 In addition, the
HOMO–LUMO gap of undoped Cor calculated from TD-DFT calculation
is 4.06 eV, whereas the experimental result reported it to be 3.29
eV.53 Calculated gas phase EHOMO and ELUMO–EHOMO of undoped/doped Cor along with its corresponding
complexes obtained at the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory are shown
in Table 7. As expected, EHOMO of doped Cor varies (−3.36 to −5.66
eV) compared to that of undoped Cor (−5.74 eV) depending upon
the nature of the dopants with significant effect on Cor(N) and Cor(3N), for which EHOMO is increased by >2.00 eV, Table 7. Electron-rich N makes the Cor sheet electron-rich
and thereby increases (less negative) the EHOMO to a significant extent. Although relatively less, EHOMO values for rest of the doped Cor also increase upon
doping. A similar variation in EHOMO values
is also reported for B/N/BN-doped graphene.50 Compared with undoped Cor (4.06 eV), the HOMO–LUMO gap also
varies (1.08–3.92 eV) on doping.

Upon complexation,
both drop and rise in EHOMO values are
observed. In some cases, the observed variation
is insignificant, whereas in some others, it is relatively larger, Table 7. Compared to those
of free Cor, EHOMO values for the Cor-Pyr
complex are increased by 0.20 eV, whereas for Cor-Im and Cor-Pz complexes,
no variation in EHOMO values is observed.
On the other hand, for Cor-123-tria, Cor-124-tria, Cor-Tetra, and
Cor-Penta complexes, EHOMO values are
increased up to 0.15 eV. Similar trends in EHOMO values are also observed for most of the complexes involving
doped Cor. However, except a few, in most of the complexes, the HOMO–LUMO
gap remained similar (changed by <0.10 eV) upon complexation. The
recent literature also reported insignificant variation (in HOMO–LUMO
gap) in the case of complexation between N-heterocycles and GBNCHs.9 Only in the case of Cor-Pyr, Cor(B)-Pyr, Cor(B)-Im, Cor(B)-Pz, and Cor(3N)-Tetra complexes, variations in the HOMO–LUMO gap are relatively
larger (up to 0.22 eV). Insignificant changes in the HOMO–LUMO
gap suggest that adsorption of N-heterocycles does not perturb the
electronic properties of the undoped/doped Cor systems to a significant
extent. Petrushenko et al. also echoed a similar effect of complexation
on the electronic properties of the GBNCH.9

To further validate the effect of complexation on electronic
properties,
UV–visible absorption spectra of the monomers and their corresponding
complexes are studied in THF, the result of which is shown in Figure 3a–h, and λmax values with corresponding excitation energies (E), oscillator strength (f), and the dominant
transition are presented in the Supporting Information Table S1 (undoped/doped Cor) and Table S2 (complexes). As mentioned, undoped Cor
possesses a strong absorption maximum at 306 nm corresponding to the
π → π* transition and can be attributed to HOMO
– 1 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO + 1 transitions. Upon
doping, a significant red shift in the absorption maxima is observed.
In the case of Cor(B) (two bands at 386 and 502 nm), Cor(3B) (one band at 1044 nm), and Cor(N) (two bands
at 460 and 580 nm), red-shifted low-intensity absorption maxima are
observed (Figure 3a
and Supporting Information Table S1). On
the other hand, for Cor(3N) (one band at 585 nm), Cor(BN) (one band at 326 nm), and Cor(3BN) (two bands
at 272 and 357 nm), high-intensity bands are observed, Supporting
Information Table S1. As expected, upon
complexation, no shift in the absorption spectra of Cor complexes
is observed (lower intensity), Figure 3b. However, in the case of complexes with Cor(B) (visible region) and Cor(3B) (beyond the visible region
> 1000 nm), red-shifted (up to 250 nm) absorption maxima are observed
(Figure 3c,d and Supporting
Information Table S2). In addition, in
the case of Cor(B), for complexes formed with Pz, 123-tria,
and 124-tria, only one band is observed, whereas for the rest of the
complexes, two bands are observed. The red shift in absorption maxima
is relatively less (up to 56 nm) for Cor(3B) complexes
with only one band, Supporting Information Table S2. In the case of Cor(N) (visible region) and Cor(3N) (visible region in most of the complexes) complexes, relatively
small red (<10 nm) and blue (<20 nm) shift are observed except
for the complexes Cor(3N)-Tetra and Cor(3N)-Penta
(show quite larger red shifts with absorption maxima at 994 and 1033
nm, respectively), Figures 3e,f. Similar small red and blue shifts are observed (UV-region)
in the case of complexes formed by Cor(BN) (one band) and
Cor(3BN) (two bands except in Cor(3BN)-Pyr and
Cor(3BN)-Penta with absorption maxima at 355 and 356 nm)
(Figure 3g,h and Supporting
information Table S2). The HOMO–LUMO
gap and absorption spectra of the complexes reveal that the electronic
properties of the considered undoped/doped Cor systems are not perturbed
to a significant level except for few complexes of Cor(B), Cor(3B), Cor(3N), and Cor(3BN). In the case of stronger interactions, where charge transfer is
prominent, complexation results in a significant shift in the corresponding
absorption spectra, whereas for interactions with poor charge transfer
(B–Hb···π interaction), the
shifting is insignificant.43,54

2.6 IR Analysis
Because the observed
N–H···π distances suggest the involvement
of N–H···π interaction in stabilizing
the complexes, there would definitely some effect of complexation
on the N–H stretching frequencies. Therefore, the said stretching
frequencies are obtained and the observed results are shown in Table 8. In free N-heterocycles,
i.e., in Pyr, Im, Pz, 123-tria, 124-tria, Tetra, and Penta, the N–H
stretching frequencies are observed at 3735, 3727, 3730, 3715, 3723,
3720, and 3704 cm–1, respectively. Upon complexation,
a red shift (lower wave number) in the corresponding stretching frequencies
is observed, Table 8. In some cases, the observed shift is nominal (<20 cm–1), whereas in some cases, the shift is quite pronounced (up to 120
cm–1). For example, in the case of complexation
involving Pyr, a nominal red shift is observed except in Cor(3B)-Pyr and Cor(3N)-Pyr complexes for which a shift of >30
cm–1 is observed, Table 8. Like Pyr, similar red shifts are also observed
for other N-heterocycles also. The N–H stretching depends not
only on the nature of dopant but also on the nature of N-heterocycles
involved in complexation. For instance, the observed shift is found
to be relatively higher in the case of Cor(3B) and Cor(3N) complexes. Apart from this, as compared to the rest, the
maximum red shift (up to 120 cm–1) is observed in
the case of complexes with Penta, Table 8. The result thus confirms the involvement
of N–H···π interaction in the adsorption
process with a larger contribution in the case of Cor(3B), Cor(3N), and Penta complexes.

3 Concluding Remarks
In this study, DFT calculations
are performed to study the physisorption
of seven 5-membered N-heterocycles on B/N/BN-doped coronene. The study
confirmed that complexes are moderately strong and stable in both
gas and solvent phases. With an increase in the number of dopants,
the stability of the complexes increases. In the adsorption process,
π···π stacking and N–H···π
interactions operate simultaneously. Dispersion interaction is the
primary mode of interaction along with some contribution from both
electrostatic and covalent modes of interaction in stabilizing the
complexes. The process of complexation is exothermic in nature and
enthalpy-driven. For most of the cases, physisorption of N-heterocycles
exhibits little impact on the electronic properties of the considered
undoped/doped Cor. The results thus could be an impetus for environmental
remediation from toxic N-heterocyclic compounds. Apart from this,
obtained SE values can also be exploited for the drug delivery purpose.

4 Theoretical and Computational Details
DFT is one of
the most widely used approaches for calculating the
electronic structure of a system. It produces results with a sensible
trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy.41,55 Because in π···π stacking long-range
dispersion interaction plays a key role, the DFT functional with dispersion
interaction in combination with a sufficiently large basis set is
preferred for estimating such interaction.41 From this viewpoint, two of the most popular DFT functionals, viz.,
ωB97-XD and M06-2X, are used for the study. The literature also
suggested the suitability of these functionals in estimating the dispersion-dominating
interactions.56−58 Therefore, the geometries are optimized with the
ωB97-XD functional in association with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis
set. The ωB97-XD functional is reported to be efficient for
calculating the thermochemical parameters and estimating the strength
of noncovalent interaction.58 Hessian calculations
are performed to ensure the real minima, and absence of imaginary
frequency confirmed the minima of the concerned geometries. To test
the consistency of the ωB97-XD functional, the single-point
calculation is also performed on the gas-phase-optimized geometries
at the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. Truhlar et al. expressed
the suitability of the M06-2X functional for studying the thermochemistry,
kinetics, and noncovalent interactions.59 A similar protocol, i.e., single-point calculation, is also carried
out at ωB97-XD/6-31++G(d,p), ωB97-XD/cc-pVTZ, and ωB97-XD/def2TZVPP
levels of theory to assess the role of the basis set. To validate
the suitability of the single-point calculation, the complexes formed
by undoped coronene are re-optimized at the ωB97-XD/cc-pVTZ
level of theory (as a representative case).

Aromaticity at the
site of complexation is estimated using the
harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) and is defined as60  where n is the number
of
bonds in the considered ring; α is the empirical constant, fixed
for a particular bond type; Ropt is the
optimal bond length; Ri is the individual
bond length between the adjacent atoms; and j corresponds
to the bond type. HOMA values are calculated using the following proposed
values of α/Ropt,j (Å): 78.6/1.387 (for C–C bond), 87.4/1.339 (for C–N
bond), 118.009/1.4378 (for B–C bond), and 72.03/1.402 (for
B–N bond).31,32,60

Stabilization energies (SEs) of the complexes are measured
using
the supermolecular model, according to which SE is the difference
of the total ground-state energies of the monomers and the ground-state
energy of the complex [for the complexation process, Cor + N-heterocycle
→ Cor···N-heterocycle, SE = (ECor + EN-heterocycle) – (ECor···N-heterocycle), where E is the total electronic energy of the
respective systems]. It is to be mentioned that estimation of SE by
this model produces basis set superposition error (BSSE) and therefore
to mitigate the issue the counterpoise (CP) correction method (N route)
is used.61 The supermolecular model is
also used for calculating the enthalpy change (ΔH) and free energy change (ΔG) during complexation,
i.e., ΔH = HCor···N-heterocycle – (HCor + HN-heterocycle) and ΔG = GCor···N-heterocycle –
(GCor + GN-heterocycle), where H and G are the enthalpies and free energies
of the corresponding monomers and complexes.

To interpret the
UV–visible absorption spectra of monomers
and complexes, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations
are performed at the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory considering
vertical excitations from the ground state to N =
10 states.62

The polarizable continuum
model (PCM, solvent is considered as
continuous dielectric medium) is used for solvent phase calculations.63 The PCM model implements the self-consistent
reaction field (SCRF) approach and defines solvent polarization in
terms of electrostatic potential. To assess the role of solvent dielectric,
single-point calculations are performed on the optimized geometries
at the same level of theory. For this purpose, cyclohexane (ε
= 2.02), ethanol (ε = 24.85), DMSO (ε = 46.82), and water
(ε = 78.35) are considered as the model solvent systems.

All calculations are performed with the Gaussian 09 programme package,
and Gauss View 5.1 is used for viewing the systems.64
