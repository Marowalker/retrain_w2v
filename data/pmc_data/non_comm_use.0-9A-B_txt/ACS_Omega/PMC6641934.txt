Sensitivity
enhancement of optical oxygen sensors is crucial for
the characterization of nearly anoxic systems and oxygen quantification
in trace amounts. In this work, for the first time we presented the
introduction of silver nanowires (AgNWs) as a sensitivity booster
for optical oxygen sensors based on AgNWs–palladium octaethylporphine–poly(methyl
methacrylate) (AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA) microfiber mats prepared by
electrospinning. Herein, a series of sensing microfiber mats with
different loading ratios of high aspect ratio AgNWs were fabricated,
and the corresponding sensitivity enhancement was systematically investigated.
With increasing incorporated ratios, the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA-sensing
microfiber mats exhibited a swift response (approx. 1.8 s) and a dramatic
sensitivity enhancement (by 243% for the range of oxygen concentration
0−10% and 235% for the range of oxygen concentration 0–100%)
when compared to the pure PdOEP–PMMA microfiber mat. Additionally,
the as-prepared sensing films were experimentally confirmed to be
highly photostable and reproducible. The advantages of AgNW-induced
sensitivity enhancement could be useful for the rational design and
realization of revolutionary highly sensitive sensors and expected
to be readily applicable to many other high-performance gas sensor
devices.

1 Introduction
Oxygen
is one of the most popular and important analytes on the
earth and is vital for the survival of most living organisms.1−3 In addition, many industrial applications such as nitrogen generation,
food packaging, industrial gas manufacturing, and industrial safety
need to ensure oxygen is absent, even at trace levels.4 As we all know, sensitivity enhancement of optical oxygen
sensors is the most crucial aspect for the characterization of nearly
anoxic systems and oxygen quantification in trace amounts. Therefore,
oxygen sensors that perform with high sensitivity have been widely
developed, among which optical oxygen sensors based on the luminescence
quenching principle have been of particular interest because of their
unique advantages, such as excellent sensitivity, accurate detection,
low detection limit, swift response/recovery, and so forth.5−7 Up to now, how to rationally design and realize revolutionary sensing
films for improving the sensitivity of oxygen sensors is still a long-standing
challenge.

In general, one alternative way to achieve high sensitivity
is
to use polymeric materials with high oxygen permeability such as a
silicone matrix and fluorinated copolymers.8,9 Apart
from the polymer matrix materials, the internal hierarchical structures
and surface morphologies of the sensors also act as important factors
to determine the sensitivity of the sensors.9,10 Distinct
from many solid sensing films or coatings, porous-based sensing films
potentially improve the sensitivity thanks to the high accessibility
of gas molecules and free movement of the oxygen molecules in the
sensing films.10,11 Thus, porous sensing films have
attracted considerable attention and manufactured in various formats
depending on their surface structures, such as particle assembly porous
films,9 honeycomb porous films,10,12 and microfiber films.13−15 In the past decades, oxygen sensor
probes encapsulated in pure polymer matrixes were integrated into
fibers via electrospinning and attracted much attention in the field
of gas sensors. Thanks to the high specific surface area of fiber
mats, a much larger analyte-sensing material interface can be realized,
leading to improved sensitivity when compared to the solid sensing
films.16 Importantly, unlike solid sensing
films, the intrinsic superhydrophobic fiber mats can serve as a promising
substrate for high-sensitive sensors because of their good water repellency
and higher oxygen gas permeability.17 Therefore,
the microfiber mats with superhydrophobic property is an efficient,
highly versatile, and a promising substrate, which can be used for
fabricating high-performance sensor devices.

Recently, precious
metal particles have been successfully applied
to the oxygen-sensing system owing to the capability to tune the emissive
spectral properties of nearby fluorophores for simple sensitivity
control.18−20 Plasmon resonance can induce enhanced local electromagnetic
fields and modulate optical properties of nearby chromophores.19 For instance, Gryczynski et al. investigated
the effects of metallic silver particles on the emission properties
of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ on silver island films.21 Roche et al. reported enhanced luminescence
for the ruthenium dye in trimethoxysilane xerogel spin-coated on a
gold surface, which exhibited high sensitivity to determine trace
oxygen.22 Önal and co-workers investigated
phosphorescence-based oxygen-sensing properties of metal porphyrins
improved by silver nanoparticles. The results indicated that the offered
sensing composites provided the advantages of fast response, enhanced
sensitivity, reversible and higher Stern–Volmer constants,
and a low limit of detection for oxygen.18 Ozturk et al. also reported the utilization of silver nanoparticles
in electrospun polymeric fibers for oxygen-sensing purposes with many
advantages such as tunable sensitivity, a linear calibration plot
for larger concentration ranges, and an increased surface area enhancement
in all sensor dynamics.20 Above all, roles
of precious metals in the sensitivity enhancement of oxygen sensors
have garnered much attention. Although silver nanoparticles are used
for the fabrication of optical oxygen sensors widely and act positively
in sensitivity improvement,18,20,21,23 there is no report on silver
nanowire (AgNW)-induced sensitivity enhancement of oxygen sensors
based on AgNWs–palladium octaethylporphine–poly(methyl
methacrylate) (AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA) microfiber mats prepared by
electrospinning.

In this work, AgNWs were used to enhance the
sensitivity of AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
microfiber mats. Herein, a series of AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA-sensing
microfiber mats with different loadings of AgNWs were fabricated,
and the sensitivity enhancement was systematically investigated with
respect to the high aspect ratio AgNWs. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study on the phosphorescence-based oxygen-sensing
properties of PdOEP related to high aspect ratio AgNWs. Results showed
that the microfiber mats enable facile superhydrophobic substrate
surface formation that was created by the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
microfibers with a diameter of ∼3 μm. Thanks to the large
surface to volume ratios, the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA-sensing microfiber
mats can efficiently reduce the diffusion length of gas molecules
to reach the molecular sensors that have been embedded within the
PMMA matrix.24 Therefore, the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA-sensing
microfiber mats showed excellent sensing performance, including high
sensitivity, reproducibility, and a swift response/recovery time.
Compared with the pure PdOEP–PMMA-sensing microfiber mat, the
oxygen-sensing performance of the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA sensors
exhibited nearly 243 and 235% enhancement for the oxygen concentration
ranging within 0–10 and 0–100%, respectively. The advantages
of AgNW-induced sensitivity enhancement could facilitate the rational
design and realization of highly sensitive sensors, which can be readily
applied to many other high-performance gas sensor devices.

2 Results and Discussion
AgNWs with a high aspect ratio
were prepared through a typical
polyol method.25−30Figure 1A shows the
UV–vis spectrum for AgNWs and the absorption peak centered
at 370 nm that can be assigned to the typical longitudinal resonance
of AgNWs, suggesting the final formation of AgNWs.29Figure 1B is the high-magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image
of the as-prepared AgNWs, which reveals that the AgNWs are uniform
in diameter with a mean value of 50 nm. Figure 1C,D shows the SEM images of AgNWs with a
diameter of 50 nm and length of 100 μm before and after two
cycles of selective precipitation and purification of AgNWs. From
the SEM images, it is obvious that there is a dramatic decrease in
the number of particles after the purification process. Figure S1 depicts the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern of the uniform AgNWs. All diffraction peaks can be indexed
to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of a pure face-centered
cubic silver crystal, which is consistent with the standard value
according to JCPDS card no. 04-0783.28,29 Additionally,
the peak in the (111) crystalline plane is much stronger (three times)
than any of other peaks, indicating the enrichment of the (111) crystalline
planes in the as-prepared AgNWs, resulting in the high aspect ratio
AgNWs.31

To understand the AgNW-induced sensitivity enhancement
effect on
oxygen-sensing properties of AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber mats,
a series of AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA-sensing microfibers with different
loadings of AgNWs were fabricated by electrospinning. The morphologies
of the original electrospun microfiber mats were visualized by SEM
(Figure 2). It is observed
that all microfibers are randomly distributed on the aluminum foil
substrate with a uniform and smooth morphology. The diameter of all
microfibers is ∼3 μm. It is clearly observed that the
concentrations of AgNW loading had no distinct influence on the morphologies
or sizes of the microfibers. The results should be attributed to the
good compatibility between the PMMA matrix and AgNWs. Figure S2 presented the SEM images (on cross
sections) of all microfibers with different dosages of AgNWs. The
neat PdOEP–PMMA microfiber without any additional AgNWs to
a dosage of 0 wt % was also studied as a control. As found in Figure S2, AgNWs were embedded into the PMMA
matrix, and the amounts of AgNWs increased as the loading increased.
Additionally, Figure 2 showed that all microfiber mats interact across each other as a
porous network, which could thus contribute to oxygen diffusion and
quenching on the emissive sensor dye.32 Therefore, the highly hierarchical porous structure of the microfiber
mats allows rapid gas exchange resulting in a swift sensor response/recovery.
The optimized AgNW loading concentration in the microfiber mats was
found to range from 1 to 2 wt %, which provides overall excellent
performance, such as higher sensitivity and swift response/recovery
properties. Moreover, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was used
to determine the loading of AgNWs, and the TGA curves of AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
microfibers are shown in Figure S3. In
addition, the TGA results are basically in agreement with the loading
of AgNWs in the experiments.

(2.0 wt %) (D,D-1); AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA (2.5 wt %) (E,E-1); and
AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA (3.0 wt %) (F,F-1).

The remarkable properties of the superhydrophobic surface
of the
sensing films have attracted much academic and industrial interest
recently because of the potential use in various sensing device applications.9 Because of the superhydrophobic property of fiber
mats, the mats serve as a promising substrate for high-sensitive sensors
because of their good water repellency and higher oxygen gas permeability.17 Subsequently, the contact angles (CAs) of the
microfiber mats were obtained on a CA tester. The CA values for PdOEP–PMMA
and AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA (1.0 wt %) microfibers mats are as high
as 140o (Figure 3). Moreover, with the increase of AgNW loading, the CA values
decreased from 141° to 131°. Although the introduction of
AgNWs into the microfiber mats resulted in a slight decrease of the
CA values, the microfiber mats still maintain the hydrophobic properties
with CA values above 130°. The surface wettabilities of the cast
film and fiber mat based on the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA (1 wt %) sample
were compared and displayed in Figure S4. For the cast film, the CA value is below 100° and exhibited
poor hydrophobic properties. Finally, the water droplets with different
colors rolled down on the mats without moistening the mat surface,
indicating the excellent superhydrophobic property of microfiber mats
loaded with AgNWs (Figure 3).

(135 ± 1°), and AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA (3.0 wt %) (131
± 1°). Photographs of water droplets (50 μL) on the
surface of microfiber mats.

To further confirm the homogeneous dispersion of PdOEP in
the PMMA
matrix, the UV–vis absorption spectra and phosphorescence spectra
of PdOEP and AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA (1 wt %) were characterized at
23 °C, as shown in Figure S5. From
the UV–vis absorption, PdOEP showed a band at 395 nm. After
doping inside the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA (1 wt %) solutions, the
bands of PdOEP also appear in the absorption spectrum of AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
(1 wt %) solutions, indicating the uniform existence of PdOEP composition
in the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA (1 wt %) composites (Figure S5). Additionally, the emission spectrum of PdOEP existed
in the emission spectrum of the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA (1 wt %) microfiber
mat, which also confirmed the existence of the PdOEP composition in
the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA (1 wt %) microfiber mat. Figure 4 shows the phosphorescence
images of the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber mats containing the
luminescent oxygen sensor dye PdOEP. Uniform red emissions were observed
for all AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfibers under the laser excitation
at 395 nm. All microfibers are distributed on the aluminum foil substrates
randomly with clear phosphorescence emission. From above results,
it is clearly demonstrated that the PdOEP sensor dye had been successfully
and homogenously doped into the PMMA matrix.

mats (λex = 395 nm, λem = 663 nm).

The phosphorescence emission spectra
of AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
microfiber mats under different oxygen concentrations are shown in Figure 5A. Subsequently,
the oxygen-sensing performances of the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber
mats were investigated systematically based on the phosphorescence
intensities. The relative phosphorescence intensities of the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
microfiber mats gradually decreased as the oxygen concentration varies
from 0 to 100%. The distinct decrease of phosphorescence intensities
is mainly attributed to the efficient quenching effect of the microfiber
mats when exposed to oxygen. In other words, all microfiber mats align
across each other, forming a highly hierarchical porous structure
of the microfiber mats that allows rapid gas exchange resulting in
a swift sensor response/recovery.32 Quenching
of phosphorescence by oxygen was long known but not understood until
Stern and Volmer derived their famous equation.33 In the optical oxygen sensors based on the quenching of
luminescence, the relationship between the luminescence intensity
and the oxygen concentration is reflected by the Stern–Volmer
equation. In many oxygen-sensing cases, the intensity from the Stern–Volmer
equation with dynamic quenching can be described by the formula 1 1  where I0 is the
value in the absence of the quencher, I is the phosphorescence
intensity under different oxygen concentrations [O2], and ksv is the Stern–Volmer constant.3 Generally, in an ideal quencher system, there
is a linear relationship between I0/I and the oxygen concentration, described as formula 1. However, many cases showed that downward Stern–Volmer
plots (SVPs) originate from the heterogeneity of the microenvironment
of the oxygen-sensing probes. It assumed that the sensor dye exists
in two distinctly different environments: one being quenchable and
the other either not being quenched at all or being quenched at a
very different rate.2 Therefore, a two-site
model was introduced to fit the SVPs, which has been widely used ever
since.34,35 Generally, the nonlinear Stern–Volmer
equation can be described as follows (eq 2) 2  where f1 and f2 the fractions of the total emission for each
component (with f1 + f2 = 1) and ksv1 and ksv2 are the Stern–Volmer
constants for each component.2

and (C) O2%: 0–10%; and (D) Response of the oxygen-sensing
mat to alternating atmospheres (0 and 101.3 kPa O2).

The SVPs for phosphorescence intensity
exhibited nonlinear behaviors
for all AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber mats, indicating heterogeneity
in the microenvironment of PdOEP caused by the loading of AgNWs. Assuming
localization of the dye at two different sites, the SVPs were fitted
using a two-site model (eq 2).34,36 The calibration SVPs for all
AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber mats in the presence of oxygen
from 0 to 100% are shown in Figure 5B, and the Stern–Volmer constants for sensing
films are summarized in Table 1. Interestingly, ksv1 values are much higher than ksv2 for all AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber mats, and the fractional
contribution of the component being quenched f1 is higher than f2.37 Therefore, a considerable linearity of SVPs
and favorable homogeneity of oxygen-sensing microfiber mats were found
at different oxygen concentrations between 0 and 10%.37 Subsequently, the calibration SVPs for all AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
microfiber mats in the presence of various oxygen concentrations from
0 to 10% are shown in Figure 5C, and the Stern–Volmer constants for sensing mats
are summarized in Table 2. From the above results, the offered AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber
mat sensing films are highly sensitive in a low oxygen concentration
and showed a linear relationship, which is in accordance with the
previous research studies.18,20,22,23 Importantly, the sensitivity
of the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber mats increased with increasing
AgNW loading. The sensitivity enhancement of AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
microfiber mats induced by AgNWs can also be observed clearly from
the values of I0/I100 presented in Tables 1 and 2. AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber
mats showed an excellent sensitivity (increased by 243 and 235%) compared
to the pure PdOEP–PMMA microfiber mat, performed under the
oxygen concentration of 0–10 and 0–100%, respectively.
However, because of the higher loading of AgNWs in the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
(3.0 wt %) microfiber mat, which resulted in the heterogeneity in
the microenvironment of PdOEP, the SVPs exhibited a nonlinear relationship
even in a low oxygen concentration, and the mathematical model is
shown in Table 2. Figure 5D shows the response/recovery
capabilities of the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA (1 wt %) microfiber mat
with the applied oxygen concentration step changing between 0 and
100%. Quenching and swift recovery cycles were fully reversible, and
the curves exhibited excellently stable optical signals in 31 cycles
when the oxygen concentration was continuously switched within 21
min. The dynamic response and recovery of the other fiber mats were
also systematically investigated in this work and presented in Figure S6. On the basis of the oxygen–nitrogen
saturation method, it was found that the response times for all microfiber
mats, t95 (i.e., the time for 95% of the
total change in phosphorescence intensities to occur), are about 3
s from the deoxygenated condition to the oxygenated condition. All
response and recovery time are presented in Table S1. Moreover, the photostability of the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
(1 wt %) microfiber mat was also studied at ambient air conditions
and exhibited high photostability with no obvious intensity decrease
(Figure S7).

Pressure-sensitive
paints (PSPs) are effective, nonintrusive tools
capable of mapping gas flows near complex surfaces.10 Optical chemical imaging by means of luminescence is a
powerful technique for pressure measurement and has been applied to
various aerodynamic researches, such as unsteady flow fields, short-duration
wind tunnels, and so on.3,38,39 Particularly, imaging of oxygen partial pressure (pO2) is of high practical relevance.40 In this work, a simple oxygen imaging platform with the
AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber mat was demonstrated. A step change
of pO2 was used to characterize the color-changing
features of the mat sensing film.41Figure 6 presented the performance
of the AgNW@PdOEP–PMMA (1.0 wt %) microfiber mat sensor film
for the PSP experiment. The PSP sensing film presented remarkable
light intensity-changing features under different pO2s. As shown in Figure 6, ultrabright red emission can be observed by the naked
eye when the sensing film was exposed to nearly 0% oxygen. The brightness
of red emission increased obviously with decreased pO2 (pO2: 0.273 Pa). From Figure 6 we can confirm that
the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA (1.0 wt %) microfiber mat sensor film
provides remarkable light intensity-changing features under different
O2 partial pressures. Especially in the lower pO2, the red-colored emission from the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
(1.0 wt %) microfiber mat sensor film can be observed with ultrahigh
brightness. The results herein indicated that the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
(1.0 wt %) microfiber mat sensor film has remarkable performance for
the PSP test. Thus, the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber mats can
be utilized for the easy identification of O2 concentration
by the naked eyes or monitoring of the unsteady pressure measurement
and unsteady flow visualization.3,10

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, for the first time, the authors demonstrated a novel
AgNW-induced sensitivity enhancement of oxygen sensors based on AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA
microfiber mats prepared by electrospinning. The introduction of high
aspect ratio AgNWs into the AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber mats
as oxygen sensing films can obviously enhance the sensitivity and
swift response/recovery properties. A series of sensing microfiber
mats with different loadings of AgNWs were fabricated, and the sensitivity
enhancement induced by AgNWs was systematically investigated. The
AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA-sensing microfiber mats exhibit a swift response
(approx. 1.8 s) and an exceptional improvement in sensitivity (increased
by 243%) compared to the pure PdOEP–PMMA sensing microfiber
mat under a low oxygen concentration. Additionally, the remarkable
light intensity-changing characteristic of AgNWs@PdOEP–PMMA-sensing
microfiber mats under a lower pO2 facilitates
the convenient identification of oxygen concentration even with the
naked eye. We believe that the advantages of AgNW-induced sensitivity
enhancement can be potentially extended for the realization of revolutionary
highly sensitive sensors which can be expected to be readily applicable
to many other high-performance gas sensor devices.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of AgNWs
AgNWs with a high
aspect ratio were synthesized and purified as described in the literatures.25,26 The synthesis process was performed as follows: first, 1.5 g of
poly(vinylpyrrolidinone) (PVP) and AgNO3 (1.0 g, 5.9 mmol)
were dissolved in 250 mL of ethylene Glycol (EG). Then, FeCl3 (0.5–25.0 μM) EG solution was added and stirred at
room temperature. The obtained mixture was then transferred into a
300 mL Telfon thermal water kettle and reacted at 130 °C for
8 h till the reaction completed,25 and
then, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature.
The process for the purification of AgNWs was performed as described
in the literatures.26 The reaction mixture
was diluted with 200 mL of deionized (DI) water. Acetone (200 mL)
was slowly added into this solution with gentle mixing. During the
mixing, the dispersion turned pale yellow, which indicated that the
AgNWs aggregated. At this point, no additional acetone was added and
the aggregates were let to settle to the bottom of the beaker, leaving
the particles suspended in the solution. The supernatant was removed
by a pipette. Subsequently, the aggregated AgNWs were redispersed
in 100 mL of DI water containing 0.5 wt % PVP and then precipitated
by 150 mL of acetone. The aggregates formed and settled within 10
min, and the supernatant was removed again. AgNWs with high purity
can be obtained after repeating this procedure for repeated 2–4
times. Finally, the AgNWs were dispersed in ethyl alcohol and collected
by centrifugation to remove the extra PVP. Finally, the AgNWs were
redispersed in dimethylformamide (DMF) with 25 mg/mL concentration
and used in the following.25,26

4.2 Fabrication
of AgNW@PdOEP–PMMA Microfiber
Mats
The formulations of AgNW@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber
mats with various AgNWs are listed in Table S1. The general procedure for the preparation of AgNW@PdOEP–PMMA
composite solutions is described as follows: first, PdOEP and DMF
were charged into the sealed ampoules and ultrasonically dispersed
until PdOEP dispersed uniformly in the DMF solution. Then, PMMA was
added into the mixture and stirred until PMMA was dissolved into DMF.
Subsequently, the AgNW solution was added into the above mixture,
and the new mixture was continued to stir at room temperature (23
°C) for 48 h. After that, the above viscous liquid solutions
were used for the fabrication of AgNW@PdOEP–PMMA microfiber
mats. The electrospinning setup consisted of a syringe pump delivering
the AgNW@PdOEP–PMMA viscous liquid solutions to a metal capillary
at a controlled flow rate of 5 mL/h. The applied voltage between the
needle and the collector was 22 kV. The AgNW@PdOEP–PMMA microfibers
were collected on aluminum foil to form fiber mats. All AgNW@PdOEP–PMMA
microfiber mats were placed under vacuum overnight to fully remove
any residual solvent and were stored in darkness prior to testing.42
