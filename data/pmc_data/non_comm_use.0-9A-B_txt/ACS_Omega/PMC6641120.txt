Solution processing-based fabrication
techniques such as liquid
phase exfoliation may enable economically feasible utilization of
graphene and related nanomaterials in real-world devices in the near
future. However, measurement of the thickness of the thin film structures
fabricated by these approaches remains a significant challenge. By
using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), a simple, accurate, and quick
measurement of the deposited thickness for inkjet-printed graphene
thin films is reported here. We show that the SPR technique is convenient
and well-suited for the measurement of thin films formulated from
nanomaterial inks, even at sub-10 nm thickness. We also demonstrate
that the analysis required to obtain results from the SPR measurements
is significantly reduced compared to that required for atomic force
microscopy (AFM) or stylus profilometer, and much less open to interpretation.
The gathered data implies that the film thickness increases linearly
with increasing number of printing repetitions. In addition, SPR also
reveals the complex refractive index of the printed thin films composed
of exfoliated graphene flakes, providing a more rigorous explanation
of the optical absorption than that provided by a combination of AFM/profilometer
and the extinction coefficient of mechanically exfoliated graphene
flakes. Our results suggest that the SPR method may provide a new
pathway for the thickness measurement of thin films fabricated from
any nanomaterial containing inks.

==== Body
Introduction
Over the past decade,
graphene and other two-dimensional (2d) materials
have been extensively studied, attracting considerable interest for
a range of applications.1 This interest,
initially directed toward graphene, originates from the various exciting
and unique properties that these 2d materials possess (for example,
high-mobility,2,3 ultrafast optical response,4,5 high thermal conductivity,6 band gap
tunability,7 or intrinsic anisotropy8,9). Many proof-of-concept devices have recently been reported that
begin to demonstrate the potential for exploiting these properties.1 As a result, the current expectation is that
many commercial device components developed from such nanomaterials
will emerge in the near future. Much research is still needed, however,
for this vision to be realized. For instance, it is crucial that not
only basic research is conducted but also corresponding progress is
simultaneously made in the development of suitable, economically competitive
fabrication techniques. The key requirements for such processes are
that it is low-cost, scalable, and also compatible with as many different
substrate materials as possible. One set of promising production methods
that fulfill these requirements are solution processing-based approaches
which formulate nanomaterial-based inks suitable for deposition on
a range of substrates with pre-existing graphics/functional printing
and coating techniques.10

In developing
applications that utilize these inks, it is essential
to measure the physical properties of the fabricated thin films, including
their thickness and uniformity. The current state-of-the-art for semitransparent,
solution-deposited thin film thickness determination is either atomic
force microscopy11,12 (AFM) or stylus profilometer.
This, however, is a difficult task because of the many complications
that arise: (i) thin films deposited in these ways are a collection
of small crystal flakes rather than a continuous film, leading to
high surface roughness and ambiguity in the true film thickness; (ii)
as-deposited thin films rarely form a sharp “step” at
their boundary, instead showing a sloped or rounded height profile.
This means that at micrometer length scales, there is often no easily-definable ‘edge’
of the film. Depending on the wetting/drying process of the ink, this
edge region with poorly defined thickness may extend for several tens
of μm into the film; (iii) physical contact with the thin film
by stylus profilometer or contact-mode AFM tip will usually displace
or drag material, not only damaging the film, but more importantly,
affecting the accuracy of the measurement. This is especially true
for thin films without any polymer binder; (iv) the measured thickness
is always only a local thickness estimation, and thereby not necessarily
a reliable representation of the film as a whole. This is particularly
relevant for AFM measurements, where it is only possible to gather
data from an area in the order of 100 × 100 μm2. Thus, there exists a great demand for a rapid, large area, contactless,
low-cost, and simple characterization technique for the thickness
measurement of solution-deposited nanomaterial thin films.

Surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) is a contactless, all-optical analysis
technique which is typically used in (bio)sensing applications,13,14 but can also be used as a method for thin film characterization.15,16 In SPR measurement, a glass substrate with a noble metal coating
(typically silver or gold) is used to couple plasmonic waves inside
the measurement substrate.15 The resonant
angle (at which the surface plasmon (SP) excitation occurs), and more
generally, the shape of the SPR curve, depend strongly on the conditions
at the surface of the measurement substrate, thus allowing the desired
information from the sample to be quickly obtained from the SPR curve.
Several works with graphene using SPR17−20 and other applications utilizing
plasmonics21−24 have recently been demonstrated.1,25 For instance,
we have recently shown that accurate estimation of both the thickness
and refractive index of CVD-grown graphene films from the SPR curve
is possible, proving that this technique is capable of gathering information
from a large sample area (∼mm2), even for single-atom
thick solid layers.20

In this work,
we report an accurate and simple method to measure
the thickness of graphene thin films fabricated by inkjet printing.
The structure and surface morphology of these solution-deposited graphene
thin films differ considerably from that of a CVD-grown layer and
the results demonstrate a new pathway for the thickness measurement
of thin films fabricated from nanomaterial containing inks. We also
show that the SPR technique is convenient and well suited for the
measurement of thin films formulated from nanomaterial inks even at
sub-10 nm thicknesses, with improved accuracy compared to that of
the more conventional AFM and stylus profilometer based measurement
techniques.

Results and Discussion
Ink Characteristics and Printing
Samples for SPR measurements
are fabricated by inkjet printing graphene ink on Au-coated SPR sensors
with varied numbers of printing repetitions. The graphene ink is prepared
via an ultrasonic-assisted liquid phase exfoliation (UALPE) process
as described elsewhere.26 In the UALPE
process, bulk graphite crystals are generally first added to a solvent
for exfoliation via ultrasonication. The resultant dispersion is then
centrifuged to sediment the unexfoliated graphite, yielding an ink
enriched with mono-, few-, and multi-layer graphene. The choice of
the solvent defines the exfoliation efficiency and ink stability,
with the difference in Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs—a
measure of the solvent–graphene intermolecular interactions)27,28 between the solvent and graphene providing an empirical measure
of solvent suitability. Here, the graphene ink is prepared via UALPE
of graphite in isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Due to its low boiling point
(82.6 °C) and low surface tension (∼23 mN m–1), IPA is well suited to printing techniques such as inkjet printing
and spray-coating, allowing good wetting of the substrate and rapid
drying of the printed films.29 However,
the mismatch in HSPs between graphene and pure IPA is too great to
support a stable dispersion. Therefore, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP),
a polymer which has previously been used to stabilize dispersions
of graphene in IPA,29 is used as an ink
stabilizer. The PVP–IPA-based inks remain stable for several
months after preparation without the formation of any visible aggregations.

The graphene ink concentration is estimated to be 0.59 g L–1 through optical absorbance spectroscopy, as described
in the Experimental Methods section (see Figure 1a). The dispersion
is diluted to 10% v/v for this measurement to reduce the effect of
scattering.30 As expected, the absorbance
spectrum is mostly featureless due to the linear dispersion of Dirac
electrons, with a single peak at ∼300 nm, a signature of the
van Hove singularity in the graphene density of states.31 Further characterizations of the graphene flakes,
including statistical measurement of the flake thickness and lateral
dimensions via AFM and Raman spectra, are presented in Figure S1. In particular, the AFM measurements
demonstrate that the graphene in the dispersion consists of few-layer
flakes with an average measured thickness of 7.3 ± 0.3 nm, and
51% of flakes are ≤4 nm or 10 layers thick, assuming a ∼0.7
nm measured thickness for a monolayer flake and ∼0.35 nm increase
for each subsequent layer.32 The average
lateral dimension is 188 ± 6 nm.

scattering loss the ink is diluted to 10% v/v for absorbance measurements.

from 1 to 30 repetitions. (c) Top-view SEM image illustrating the
porous nature of the inkjet-printed graphene film (30 printing repetitions)
after the removal of the PVP by annealing.

Next, the fluidic properties of the graphene ink for inkjet
printing
are assessed. Inkjet inks are typically described in terms of the
dimensionless figure of merit , where γ, ρ, and μ are
the ink surface tension (mN m–1), density (g cm–3), and viscosity (mPa·s), respectively, and a is the inkjet nozzle diameter (μm).33 The preferred range for stable jetting is 1 < Z < 14, with Z < 1 failing to jet,
and Z > 14 producing undesired satellite droplets.
Achieving stable jetting with a single droplet for each jetting impulse
is of primary importance for inkjet printing, ensuring that the ink
is uniformly deposited on to the substrate, but only in desired areas.
The ink in this work has γ ∼ 28 mN m–1, μ ∼ 2.4 mPa·s, and ρ ∼ 0.8 g cm–3, and the printer (Fujifilm Dimatix DMP-2381) uses
cartridges with a = 22 μm. This gives a Z value of ∼9.2, indicating that the graphene ink
is suitable for inkjet printing. This allows the printing process
to occur without the formation of unwanted satellite droplets.26,29 This was confirmed by the printer stroboscopic camera, which showed
a stable droplet jetting sequence (see the inset of Figure 1a). Figure 1b shows inkjet-printed graphene squares on
microscope glass slides with printing repetitions varied from 1 to
30. The absorbance of the printed graphene films (listed in the inset
for each graphene square) increases linearly with increasing number
of printing repetitions. Also, as can be seen from the image, the
printed patterns are highly uniform with well-defined edges, further
demonstrating that the ink jetting and wetting properties are well
tuned for this printing process.

After inkjet printing, the
samples shown in Figure 1b are heated at 400 °C for 30 min to
decompose and remove the PVP polymer stabilizer.34 Note that the PVP decomposition step is also performed
on those samples used in the SPR measurements, discussed later in
this work. To verify that the 400 °C annealing step does not
affect the quality of the printed graphene layer, Raman measurements
are also performed after the annealing step (also shown in Figure S1). As described, both the spectra (pre-
and post-annealing) indicate that the graphene is not affected by
the annealing process. However, the removal of PVP leaves the printed
film as a porous graphene structure, with large fractions of the volume
previously filled by the polymer now consisting of air. This porosity
and the air content is further evidenced by SEM imaging of the printed
graphene (shown in Figure 1c), which clearly shows air gaps within the thin film. Based
on the concentrations of PVP and graphene in our ink, we estimate
that PVP could even comprise ∼50% of the total volume of the
printed film before the annealing step, assuming the density of graphene
is equal to that of graphite (2.3 g cm–3). However,
the density of the bulk graphite crystals may differ from the density
of exfoliated graphene flakes (∼0.03–0.4 g cm–3),26 which would give a lower volume fraction
for PVP. Simultaneously, the thickness of our thin film reduces when
the annealing step is performed, also affecting the actual composition
of the film after the annealing step. Note that, neglecting the possibility
of any air present in the film, the flake-to-flake distance after
the PVP decomposition step would not be the same as that in perfectly
aligned graphite crystals or mechanically exfoliated graphene flakes.
All these factors introduce a considerable uncertainty in our estimations
of the thin film composition. Even so, it can still be concluded that
the remaining graphene structure is porous in nature, physically different
from the perfectly crystalline graphene/graphite crystals; and contains
a significant fraction of air by volume.

SPR Measurements
The SPR measurements of the inkjet-printed
graphene samples are performed in the Kretschmann configuration. Figure 2a,b show typical
SPR curves measured from a series of inkjet-printed graphene samples
at 670 and 785 nm wavelengths, respectively. In addition, the SPR
spectra of a plain reference sample are also shown. To explain the
SPR results, the inset of Figure 2b illustrates the SPR measurement principle. In SPR
measurement, the incident angle (θ) at which the laser hits
the substrate is altered, changing the wave vector component of the
incident light parallel to the substrate, kx. The SP excitation occurs when the wave vector component
matches the wave vector of the SP.15 The
wave vector of the SP is strongly affected by the conditions near
the gold/dielectric boundary; therefore, the SPR curve of inkjet-printed
graphene shows pronounced changes corresponding to the variation in
the film thickness. The general trend seen in Figure 2c,d is that the SPR angle increases, along
with the broadening of the resonance as the printing repetition increases
(i.e., increased thickness of graphene thin film). This is a typical
behavior in SPR measurements when they are performed on a material
which absorbs light. Indeed, the SPR angles measured for the 670 nm
laser excitation are 43.42, 43.55, 44.41, and 46.58° for 5, 10,
20, and 30 printing repetitions, respectively. Given that the SPR
angle of the reference sample is 43.05°, the above shift in the
SPR angle is nonlinear. For the 785 nm laser excitation, the SPR resonance
angles are 42.43, 42.68, 42.80, 43.53, and 44.54° with 0, 5,
10, 20, and 30 printing repetitions, respectively. At this wavelength,
the SPR angle shift is also nonlinear and slightly smaller (∼2.1°)
than that measured for the 670 nm excitation (∼3.5°) for
films with 30 printing repetitions.

Figure 2 (a, b) SPR curves of inkjet-printed graphene
samples measured with
the wavelength of 670 and 785 nm, respectively. Fits (marked with
•) were obtained with the method described in the Experimental Methods section. Inset of (b) shows
a schematic illustrating the SPR measurement principle. During the
measurement, the incident angle of the laser beam is altered causing
the wave vector component parallel to the SPR substrate, kx, to change. When the wave vector matches the wave
vector of the SP (which is strongly affected by the materials near
the surface of the SPR substrate) SP excitation occurs. (c) SPR resonance
angle, (d) full width at half-maximum, and (e) graphene film thickness
as a function of printing repetitions. The graphene film thickness
was obtained from the fitted SPR curves.

Because both the complex refractive index and the thickness
of
the graphene film affect the SPR angle, the optical information from
the SPR curves is obtained by fitting the calculated SPR curves to
the measurements using the method described in the Experimental Methods section. Note that we perform the fitting
process by assuming the same refractive index of graphene for both
the 670 and 785 nm wavelengths. This assumption, which reduces the
number of fitting parameters, is justified as the refractive index
of graphene is almost constant in the visible/near infrared range.20,31,35−37 As shown in Figure 2, the fitted curves
agree well with the measurements. The information obtained by fitting
(listed in Table 1 and
also shown in Figure 2e) reveals that the thickness of the graphene film increases linearly
by ∼0.95 nm per printing repetition. This linear increase is
desired because it allows the layer thickness to be controlled by
the number of printing repetitions and agrees well with previous observations
for an optimally working printing process.11 To reduce the effect of the small changes in the refractive index
(between the samples with different numbers of printing repetitions)
to the fitted layer thickness, a fitting analysis is also performed
by assuming a similar refractive index for all the different samples
(fitted curves shown in Figure S2). In
this way, the difference between the fitted curves only originates
from the changes in the graphene film thickness; and similarly, this
fitting technique reveals a refractive index value, which represents
an average refractive index of all the printed graphene samples. As
a result, the reliability of the fitting technique could be further
estimated by comparing the parameters obtained by separate fitting
with the set of parameters calculated by the combined fitting method
presented in Table S1. As observed, the
globally fitted thicknesses and the refractive index agree reasonably well
with the separately fitted values, providing further evidence of the
reliability of the values listed in Table 1.

The complex refractive index of
the printed graphene thin film
can also be obtained from the fits. The fitted optical constants are
presented in Table 1. It can be seen that the refractive index of the graphene film slowly
increases with the increasing number of printing repetitions but is
still very close to the refractive index of air (the largest refractive
index is 1.158). Also, the global fitting method reveals a refractive
index of ∼1.12, which is close to all separately fitted refractive
index values. We note that the experimentally measured refractive
indices of micromechanically exfoliated graphene flakes and CVD graphene
films typically range between 2.6 and 3.20,31,35−37 The refractive index
of inkjet-printed graphene measured by SPR is, therefore, significantly
smaller. A similar observation can be made for the extinction coefficient,
which is observed to be ∼0.50. The literature value for the
extinction coefficient of micromechanically exfoliated graphene flakes
and CVD graphene layers is typically ∼1.4.31,35−37

The difference in the optical constants between
the literature
values and the SPR results can be explained by the dissimilarities
between the inkjet-printed graphene thin film and single- or few-graphene
layers of CVD or exfoliated samples. Though the inkjet-printed graphene
film is mainly composed of few-layer thick graphene flakes (see the Figure S1) which, when taken in isolation, are
expected to have a refractive index similar to that reported in the
literature, the printed film as a whole is porous due to the reasons
explained above. It is therefore not surprising that the average refractive
index of our inkjet-printed graphene thin film is notably smaller.
Indeed, a similar observation has been made for porous silicon and
mesoporous silica with refractive indices of ∼1.4 and ∼1.07,
respectively, significantly smaller than the refractive index of their
bulk counterparts (3.44 and 1.47 at 670 nm).38,39 Thus, the refractive index or the extinction coefficient of an inkjet-printed
graphene film could be used as a measure of its printing uniformity/porosity.
For instance, by comparing the measured extinction coefficient to
the literature values, our inkjet-printed graphene thin film absorbs
between 30 and 50% of the amount that a similar thickness of single
layer graphene would absorb. This also indicates that the graphene
film after the PVP decomposition step is porous in nature either due
to a large >50% air content and/or due to exfoliated graphene flakes
locating further apart from each other (compared to perfectly aligned
graphite crystals), thus agreeing with the previous porosity discussion.

AFM and Stylus Profilometer for Inkjet-Printed Graphene Thickness
Determination
To compare the thickness values estimated using
SPR with those obtained by conventional methods, AFM and stylus profilometer
measurements are performed on the sample shown in Figure 1b. The results of these experiments
are presented in Figure 3 and listed in Table 1. Figure 3a shows
three different profilometer line profiles measured from a sample
with 10 printing repetitions from the locations illustrated in the
inset. Averaging the height of each line scan with respect to the
baseline of the substrate gives film thicknesses of 24.1, 21.6, and
17.7 nm for each measurement, demonstrating that the thickness measurement
of the thin film differs significantly (>30%) depending on the
location
of the section measured. A similar observation can also be made from
the AFM measurements (see Figure 3b). Once again, the measured thickness is highly dependent
on the location. AFM measurements of the sample with 20 printing repetitions
are 18.7, 21.3, and 27.1 nm along the red, green, and blue lines shown
in Figure 3c. In contrast
to SPR measurements, this type of variation is typical for profilometry
and AFM measurements of such nanostructured printed thin films and
exemplifies how these results may depend on the interpretation and
judgment of the user. This highlights the difficulties present for
such measurements by AFM and stylus profilometer.

film thickness measurements using AFM and
stylus profilometer. (a, b) Three different stylus profilometer and
AFM measured line scans of the graphene sample fabricated by printing
10 and 20 repetitions of graphene ink, respectively. Inset of (a)
shows an optical microscope image of different measurement spots.
The graphene film (in (b)) is schematically highlighted with different
colors to illustrate its presence. (c) AFM image from the same graphene
sample as that shown in (b). (d) Differences between the averaging
processes of different measurement techniques. The layer model used
in the analysis of SPR measurement assumes an average refractive index
at every different distance from the substrate/graphene interface,
thus giving smaller weight to surface roughness. For stylus profilometer
and AFM measurements, the averaging is performed summing the measured
height at each measurement position, thereby giving as much weight
to thick aggregated flakes as to the values recorded from the flatter
places. (e) Comparison between the AFM, stylus profilometer, and SPR
measured graphene film thicknesses as a function of printing repetitions.

To make these AFM and stylus profilometer
measurements better take
account of the local thickness variations, we plotted an average of
the measurement values gathered from a few different locations in Figure 3e. We note that by
increasing the sample size, the effect of local thickness variations
can be reduced. However, this simultaneously increases the time required
for the measurement. Using this averaging scheme, a thickness value
of 21.1 nm can be obtained for an inkjet-printed graphene thin film
with 10 printing repetitions with the stylus profilometer. On the
other hand, the thickness of the same sample is only ∼6 nm
when it is measured by SPR and 19.5 nm when measured by AFM. For the
sample with 20 printing repetitions, the thin film thickness is 17
and 22 nm when measured with SPR and AFM, respectively, but 30 nm
when measured with the stylus profilometer. This shows that considerable
variations exist in thickness estimations between the measurement
methods. Therefore, the selection of the measurement spot and sample
size used in the averaging process still has an effect, even after
the averaging has been performed from millimeter long line scans and
multiple different locations. To get a better idea of the comparative
size of the measurement areas, see Figure S3.

To highlight the differences between the measurement methods,
we
fit a first-order curve to the results listed in Table 1. This gives a ∼1.46
and ∼1.26 nm thickness increase per printing repetition for
the stylus profilometer and AFM, respectively. Comparing this to the
thickness increase of 0.95 nm per printing repetition observed using
SPR, we suggest that the stylus profilometer and AFM overestimate
(by a factor of ∼1.5 and ∼1.3, respectively) the average
thickness for our inkjet-printed graphene thin films. The fact that
SPR reveals a smaller thickness than the stylus profilometer and AFM
is due to the presence of isolated overlaid flakes, which are visible
in the AFM images as large spikes in the line profiles (see Figure 3). The contribution
of these features to the SPR measurement is small, given that when
considering the horizontal cross-section of the film, the further
we rise above the substrate/film interface, the greater the proportion
of air with respect to graphene (compare the horizontal lines at the
distances of 20, 60, and 100 nm from the graphene/substrate interface
in the schematically drawn sample cross-section shown in Figure 3d). Therefore, these
thicker regions of the printed film can be effectively considered
to represent only “optically denser” air in the SPR
layer model. As a result, these thick regions do not as such contribute
to the SPR measured thickness of the graphene layer (which in this
exemplary case would be ∼20 nm). For AFM and profilometry,
however, these spikes would strongly contribute to the overall measurement
which is taken as the mean of the measured heights within the printed
film (increasing the measured average value of the film thickness
in Figure 3d to a significantly
larger value than 20 nm).

Inkjet-Printed Graphene Thin Film Absorbance
Finally,
to assess the accuracy of our SPR results, we measure the absorbance
of the inkjet-printed graphene films as a function of the film thickness.
The absorbance is measured using a UV–vis spectrometer on the
sample shown in Figure 1b. Note that absorbance can also be calculated from the values obtained
by SPR and stylus profilometer/AFM measurements. The calculated graphene
absorbance, that is, A = 2 – log10(T(d)/T0[%]), is obtained from the transmittance using T(d) = T0 exp(−αd), where d is the measured film
thickness from the stylus profilometer, AFM, or SPR, and α is
the absorption coefficient as calculated from the extinction coefficient
using the relation α = 4πk/λ. For the stylus profilometer and AFM data, we use the literature
value of 1.4 for the extinction coefficient of mechanically exfoliated
graphene.31,35−37 We note that to the
best of our knowledge no data on the complex refractive index of inkjet-printed
graphene films yet exists.

The comparison between the measured
and calculated absorbance is shown in Figure 4. The absorbance increases linearly with
increasing number of printing repetitions and is measured as ∼0.18
for the sample with 30 printing repetitions. The absorbance calculated
for the same sample according to the SPR results is ∼0.12,
slightly smaller than that seen in the absorption measurement. The
calculations from the profilometer and AFM data, however, lead to
a calculated absorbance of ∼0.45 and ∼0.50 for the same
sample, respectively (i.e., >2 times larger than the absorption
measurement
results). On the other hand, estimation of the thickness of the graphene
film deposited with the largest number of printing repetitions from
the measured absorbance (by assuming the extinction coefficient of
1.4 for mechanically exfoliated graphene flakes) gives a thickness
of ∼10 nm. A layer thickness of ∼10 nm is significantly
smaller than that measured by SPR, AFM, and stylus profilometer, strongly
suggesting a smaller extinction coefficient for our inkjet-printed
graphene layer than that reported
in the literature for CVD and micromechanically exfoliated graphene.
To estimate this further, we consider the profilometer measured thickness
as the correct film thickness and calculate the extinction coefficient
value, which gives a similar absorbance to that measured experimentally.
This results in an extinction coefficient of ∼0.56 for the
sample with 30 printing repetitions. By performing a similar calculation
on all the samples, the extinction coefficient of our graphene thin
film is estimated to be between 0.5 and 0.6. This is marginally larger
but still, notably, in the same range as that obtained from the SPR
measurement. Thus, the absorbance values calculated from the SPR results
seem to replicate the measured absorbance data better than the stylus
profilometer or AFM results combined with the literature values of
graphene extinction coefficient. This all provides further evidence
for the accuracy of the SPR method for solution deposited material
characterization.

Figure 4 Comparison between the absorbance values measured by UV–vis
spectrometer (plotted with black stars) and those calculated from
the thickness and the refractive index obtained by SPR and stylus
profilometer/AFM measurements. The extinction coefficient used for
profilometer and AFM calculations is 1.431,35−37 for the data marked with blue and green triangles.

We note that the absorbance values
reported in this work do not
imply that micromechanically exfoliated single layer graphene flakes
should absorb less than 2.3% of light or possess a smaller extinction
coefficient than the value of 1.4, which is well established.31,40 The observations of this work only imply that the porous structure
of our solution processed graphene film is physically different to
that of micromechanically exfoliated graphene flakes and CVD graphene
films, as was also clearly demonstrated by the optical data gathered
by the SPR technique.

Conclusions
We have shown that SPR
can be used to accurately measure the thickness
of inkjet-printed graphene thin films. Our results demonstrate that
the thickness of graphene thin films has a linear correlation with
the number of printing repetitions (∼0.95 nm thickness increase
per printing repetition). The thickness obtained by SPR is ∼1.3
and ∼1.5 times smaller than that measured using AFM and the
stylus profilometer, respectively. We suggest that the apparent difference
is due to the different averaging schemes as the SPR method gives
less weight to the surface roughness caused by the isolated and protruding
graphene flakes in the porous graphene thin film. In addition to the
thickness, the SPR method also reveals the complex refractive index
of the thin film, which is significantly lower than that measured
from the micromechanically exfoliated or CVD-grown graphene samples.
This is due to the high porosity of the thin film resulting from decomposition
of the PVP polymer stabilizer in the ink formulation. The extinction
coefficient and the thickness values of graphene obtained by SPR measurements
match the measured absorbance data better than those obtained using
AFM and the stylus profilometer. We therefore strongly believe that
SPR could be exploited as a fast, cost-effective, and accurate characterization
technique for solution processed graphene thin films.

Experimental
Methods
Information from the SPR Sensors
All samples reported
in this work are fabricated on gold coated SPR substrates (or for
absorption measurements, directly to microscope slides (Jaytec MBG01012)).
First, a chromium adhesion layer (∼2 nm) and a gold layer (∼45
nm) are evaporated on the glass slides using e-beam evaporation at
a 0.1–0.2 nm/s rate for both Cr and Au. Information on the
two metal layers and the refractive index of each layer (gathered
by the quartz crystal microbalance technique combined with the SPR
measurement results) is listed in Table S2. In addition to the printed graphene samples, reference SPR sensors
are also needed in the SPR measurements. The used reference sensors
are always from the same evaporation batch as the printed graphene
samples. Note that we also verified that the SPR spectra of different
reference sensors are identical.

Graphene Ink Formulation
and Inkjet Printing
Graphene
ink is formulated with the UALPE technique. First, 200 mg of graphite
crystals (100 mesh flakes; Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 mg of PVP (average
molecular weight 10 000 Da; Sigma-Aldrich) are mixed with 20
mL of IPA. The mixture is sonicated in a bath sonicator for 12 h.
The bath temperature is kept at ∼15 °C during the exfoliation
process. After this, the dispersion is centrifuged for 1 h at 4030
rpm (1540g) to separate the few-layer graphene flakes
from the unexfoliated materials. The top 70% of the graphene dispersion
is then collected. The graphene ink is stable over several months
without the formation of any visible aggregates.

The concentration
of dispersed graphene is estimated from the optical absorption of
the dispersion via the Beer–Lambert Law. The ink is diluted
to 10% v/v to reduce the effects of scattering on the measured absorption.30 The concentration is estimated (using an absorption
coefficient of 2460 L g–1 m–1 at 660 nm41,42) to be 0.59 g L–1.

Sample fabrication by inkjet printing is performed with a
DMP-2831
Dimatix Printer. The ink is characterized for its surface tension,
density, and viscosity, which can be combined with the nozzle diameter
to calculate a figure of merit for jetting stability (Z). The ink surface tension and viscosity are measured using pendant
drop measurement and parallel plate rheometer, respectively. The ink
density is determined by considering the mass of known volumes of
ink. During printing, the substrates are heated to a temperature of
60 °C to promote the evaporation of the ink carrier solvent (IPA).
The PVP polymer binder is then decomposed by heating the samples at
400 °C for 30 min. The distribution of flake dimensions (measured
via AFM) and the Raman spectra for the ink before and after annealing
are presented in Figure S1.

SPR Measurements
SPR measurements are performed in
a Kretschmann configuration using a BioNavis MP-SPR Navi 200-L apparatus
equipped with 670 and 785 nm light sources. The measurements are performed
at 25 °C in ambient air with a ∼0.5 mm diameter measurement
beam spot. Therefore, the SPR method gathers information from a large
sample area (∼0.2 mm2), compared to approximately
millimeter long tracks for the stylus profilometer, and ∼0.003
mm2 for AFM. Thus, the information obtained from the spectra
represents an average value for the sample.

2 × 2 Transfer Matrix
Method (TMM)
The 2 ×
2 TMM is a simple method to derive the overall reflection and transmission
coefficients of a multilayered optical system. In this model, all
layers are assumed to be semi-infinite and isotropic, which means
the inkjet-printed graphene thin film (as well as the Au and Cr metal
layer) is considered to be a homogeneous layer with a specific refractive
index and thickness. The relation between the first and the last boundary
condition of the N-layered optical system is defined by employing
the transfer matrix of the system as follows 1  where E⃗ and H⃗ represent the tangential components of the electric
and magnetic fields, respectively, which must be continuous, and M represents the system matrix. By taking the Fresnel equations
into account, together with the transfer matrix and the relation of
the boundary conditions of the N-layered system, one can derive the
overall reflected and transmitted light intensity.43

SPR Curve Analysis
The obtained
angular spectra are
analyzed using a custom software based on Matlab,
which fits a solution of Maxwell’s equation to the measurement
results with the help of a Metropolis algorithm.
During each fitting iteration, the solution to Maxwell’s equation
is calculated by using a transfer matrix formalism of 2 × 2 matrices
as described above. Thus, the fitting program alters the graphene
layer parameters (complex refractive index and the thickness) until
a best match between the measurement and the simulation is found.
Note that the fitting for the graphene thin film samples is performed
with multiple wavelength analysis, assuming the same refractive index
of the graphene film for both the measurement wavelengths. This assumption
is justified because the complex refractive index of graphene is roughly
constant at our measurement range.20,31,35−37 In addition to this fitting technique,
the information from the samples is gathered assuming the same refractive
index for all different inkjet-printed graphene layers. This fitting
method is referred to as global fitting in the main text. It allows
us to estimate the reliability of the values converged by the separate
fitting method.

The results obtained by the custom software
are compared to those from commercial BioNavis LayerSolver software and Winspall freeware; and the results
are observed to match well. Our software is based on the Metropolis algorithm which, whilst converging toward a best fit solution, changes
the complex refractive index and the thickness of inkjet-printed graphene
layers. The advantage gained by using the Metropolis algorithm in the fitting is that it prevents the fitting software
from converging to a local minimum, which can happen because during
iteration occasionally a bad solution will be accepted. By doing so,
the algorithm is capable of pushing itself outside of the local minima
and continues the iteration until a global solution to the fitting
problem is determined. We note that the optical information of the
SPR measurement substrate also strongly influences the calculated
SPR curve (i.e., the thickness and refractive index of all the other
layers in the sensor structure). Therefore, to ensure maximum accuracy,
background scans and fits for the uncoated SPR substrates are performed
prior to the graphene deposition. The optical information obtained
from these fits is provided in the Table S2.

AFM and Stylus Profilometer
AFM and stylus profilometer
measurements are performed to estimate the thickness of the printed
graphene thin films. AFM imaging is performed using a Bruker Dimension
Icon setup operated in PeakForce mode. The maximum scan area measured
using the AFM is 50 μm × 50 μm. Profilometry measurements
are performed with a Bruker DektakXT stylus profilometer using line
scans of distances between 1.0 and 2.0 mm. By way of post-measurement
processing, the AFM images are corrected with a flattening algorithm,
fitting each individual line data to a first-order curve and then
a second-order curve to subtract the sample tilt and surface bowing,
respectively. Stylus profilometer line scans are leveled with respect
to the quasi-linear, horizontal profile of the glass substrate.

Optical Absorbance
Optical absorbance of the fabricated
graphene samples is measured with a standard UV–vis spectrometer
as a function of inkjet-printed film thickness. For the measurement,
1–30 printing repetitions of graphene are printed on the microscope
slide and the absorbance recorded. The microscope slide absorbance
is subtracted from the measured values.

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman measurements are performed
using a Renishaw InVia microspectrometer at an excitation wavelength
of 514 nm, to demonstrate that inkjet-printed graphene film is composed
of graphene flakes. Spectra are acquired at room temperature in a
backscattering geometry using a 100× microscope objective lens
with a spot size of ∼1 μm2. The power on the
sample is ∼0.01 mW.
