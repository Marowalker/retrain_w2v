Photodynamic
therapy (PDT) involves use of a photosensitizer, whose
activation with light leads to the production of singlet oxygen (SOS),
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and initiation of associated
cell toxicity. Because a cell’s mitochondria constitute sites
where oxygen levels are high, ROS can be readily produced, and apoptosis
is commonly initiated. Therefore, an ideal PDT agent might be a potent
photosensitizer that could naturally accumulate in mitochondria. Although
a number of mitochondria-targeting moieties, including triphenylphosphine,
guanidinium, and bisguanidium, have been identified, a quantitative
comparison of their efficacies in targeting mitochondria has not been
performed. In this study, we have prepared triphenylphosphine, guanidinium,
and bisguanidium derivatives of the FDA-approved PDT agent verteporfin
(Visudyne, benzoporphyrin derivative-monoacid ring A: BPD-MA) and compared their abilities to induce the intracellular perturbations
common to potent PDT agents. Cellular parameters examined included
subcellular localization of the verteporfin, real-time monitoring
of SOS production, quantitation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation,
analysis of mitochondria and chromatin integrity, characterization
of cytoskeletal disruption and evaluation of cytochrome C release as a measure of apoptosis. An analysis of these parameters
demonstrates that the triphenylphosphine derivative (0323) has better mitochondria-targeting efficacy, SOS production, and
mitochondria membrane toxicity than either unmodified verteporfin
or its guanidinium derivatives. Consistent with this potency, 0323 also induced the most prominent mitochondria swelling,
actin depolymerization, pyknosis, and cytochrome C release. We conclude that triphenylphosphine has a better mitochondria-targeting
moiety than guanidinium or bis-guanidinium and those PDT photosensitizers
with improved cytotoxicities can be prepared by conjugating a mitochondria-targeting
moiety to the desired photosensitizer.

Introduction
Photodynamic therapy
(PDT) combines light energy, oxygen, and a
light-absorbing molecule called a photosensitizer to induce an oxidative
stress in the illuminated (usually neoplastic) cells.1 Each of these components is nontoxic by itself, but, when
combined, can induce a chain of reactions leading to the production
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing cell death. The photosensitizer
(PS) is a molecule that can absorb a photon that excites an outer
shell electron to a singlet state (S1), which can then
either return to its ground state (i.e., by fluorescence or heat emission)
or undergo intersystem crossing to a triplet state,2 which can then react with oxygen to generate free radicals
(type I reaction) or singlet oxygen species (type II reaction). These
reactive oxygen species then undergo a series of downstream reactions
to cause oxidative damage.3

One of
the challenges in photodynamic therapy (PDT) is to develop
novel photosensitizers that can improve the therapeutic efficacy without
imposing undesirable requirements for prolonged/enhanced exposure
to activating light. The major parameter used to compare the potencies
of different photosensitizers is singlet oxygen quantum yield (ϕΔ), which is the efficiency by which a photosensitizer
uses light energy to convert molecular oxygen to singlet oxygen.4 Photosensitizers that contain the highest ϕΔ are desirable because singlet oxygen is a powerful
oxidant that can directly induce cellular toxicity. However, it has
been demonstrated that a direct correlation between singlet oxygen
production and cell death does not exist, but rather the toxicity
of PDT depends on the subcellular localization of the PDT agent.5 Because singlet oxygen is highly reactive and
readily quenched (its lifetime is of the order of 40 ns and its diffusion
radius is ∼20 nm6), its site of
production will almost certainly be its site of oxidative damage (i.e.,
a mammalian cell’s diameter is of the order of ∼10–30
μm and mitochondria organelles are ∼900 nm wide).7 The solution, if achievable, would be to target
a PDT agent specifically to an organelle where SOS/ROS could be efficiently
produced and the toxic effects of SOS/ROS would be sensitively experienced.
Based on the reports that mitochondria contain high concentrations
of oxygen9 and that even low levels of
singlet oxygen produced in the mitochondria are more toxic than large
amounts produced in the nucleus,8 it seemed
logical to try to develop a photosensitizer that would target the
mitochondria. Additional observations that the mitochondria are decisive
regulators of apoptosis and that these organelles produce most of
the cell’s energy only added motivation to this objective.10,11 Indeed, most of the clinically approved photosensitizers including
Foscan,12 Photofrin,13 and Visudyne14 already partially
localize to the mitochondria.

Methods to improve mitochondria
targeting have included conjugation
of such mitochondria-targeting moieties as guanidinium, bisguanidinium,
or triphenylphosphine groups to the main compound to introduce a delocalized
positive charge and increase the compound’s lipophilicity,
which collectively are thought to increase a conjugate’s affinity
for mitochondria. A previous study by Sibrian-Vazquez et al. showed
an increased localization of porphyrin compounds to the mitochondria
upon synthesizing their guanidinium and bisguanidinium derivatives.15 Although these guanidinium and bisguanidinium
were shown to localize to the mitochondria, the modified compounds
were never compared to the parent compound, making it unclear whether
these molecules actually increased mitochondria localization. Triphenylphosphine
group is another extensively studied mitochondria-targeting moiety
that has been used for the delivery of chemotherapeutics,16−19 antioxidants,20 imaging probes,21 photosensitizers,22−24 and other molecules.25 However, to our knowledge, there has not been
a comparison of these moieties in their mitochondria-targeting efficiencies.

Herein, we present a multimodal comparison of the PDT agent, verteporfin,
with three of its mitochondria-targeted derivatives in a human head
and neck cancer cell line. The compound verteporfin was chosen because
it was already known to partially concentrate in mitochondria, which
if increased upon conjugation to guanidinium, bisguanidinium, or triphenylphosphine
would provide a robust test of the value of mitochondrial targeting
for maximization of PDT potency. Moreover, verteporfin is an FDA-approved
drug for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration26,27 and has a longer absorption wavelength than the other mitochondria-targeting
photosensitizers mentioned above, which is desirable to target deeper
tissue.

Results and Discussion
The molecules synthesized for
this study included 0317, which contains monoguanidinium
group in the carboxyl terminus; 0320, which contains
a cyclic bis-guanidinium group that bridges
the carboxyl termini; and 0323, which contains a triphenylphosphine
group on the carboxyl terminus (Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1, the monoacid ring A of verteporfin was coupled to
guanidine and (2-aminoethyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate
methanaminium (HATU) as a coupling agent to obtain the monoguanidinium
and triphenylphosphonium derivative of verteporfin named 0317 and 0323, respectively. To achieve bis- and tris-guanidinium
derivative of verteporfin for increased mitochondria-targeting, we
tried the conventional methyl ester hydrolysis conditions to obtain
di- and tri- free carboxylic acid derivative of verteporfin. However,
our attempt with strong and mild basic conditions for methyl ester
hydrolysis were unsuccessful, and we observed complex products in
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LCMS). Finally, we
optimized using Me3SnOH, which had been established by
Nicolaou and co-workers28 to hydrolyze
selectively the aliphatic methyl esters without damaging the olephenic
methyl ester in the E ring of verteporfin. To obtain a tris-guanidinium
derivative of verteporfin, the tri-carboxylic acid derivative was
further conjugated with guanidine using HATU coupling condition. The
reaction was monitored by LCMS, and the major product shows the molecular
weight of 755.2, which is not that of our expected tris-guanidinium
derivative 0319 (MW: 816.9). The LCMS analysis indicates
that the isolated product with the molecular weight of 755.2 was the
cyclic bis-guanidinium derivative 0320.

To compare these compounds, we quantified and compared their
mitochondria
localization, intracellular singlet oxygen production, and mitochondria
membrane potential (Δψm) change. Furthermore,
we studied the morphological changes of the cytoskeleton and mitochondria
and reactive oxygen species production. Because the goal of PDT is
to kill pathological cells, cell death was analyzed by observing nuclear
pyknosis and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria.
Results from this study should facilitate the discovery and optimization
of novel PDT therapeutics by determining which substituent will promote
the most photosensitizer accumulation in the mitochondria. Moreover,
the methods employed here should help guide development of newer photosensitizers
by establishing methods to compare their efficacy.

Cellular Localization of
Modified Compounds
The subcellular
fate of the modified compounds was determined by fluorescent microscopy.
Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to determine the
localization of the photosensitizers (Figure 2i–l) in the mitochondria, which was
labeled with Mitotracker green (Figure 2e–h). As shown in Figure 2, when the Mitotracker and 0323 fluorescence images were merged, a very strong colocalization signal
was observed (Figure 2p). The calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients (±SEM)
were 0.722 (± 0.044) for BPD-MA, 0.678 (± 0.029)
for 0317, 0.631 (± 0.029) for 0320,
and 0.860 (± 0.012) for 0323. Using a one-way ANOVA
with Tukey post-hoc test, the modified compound 0323 showed
a significantly higher localization to the mitochondria than BPD-MA (p-value = 0.033), whereas the other
modified compounds showed no difference compared to BPD-MA.

mitochondria. (a–d) Bright field images of human KB cells.

higher colocalization compared to BPD-MA using Pearson’s
correlation coefficient and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc
test (p = 0.0326). n = 5 images
for each group. *p < 0.05. It should be noted
that the photosensitizer fluorescence images do not correlate with
the amount of compound intracellularly. These images were modified
after capture to help the readers optimally visualize the intracellular
localization of each compound. These adjustments have no effect on
the calculation of colocalization because Pearson’s Correlation
Coefficient is independent of pixel intensity/brightness.

The results demonstrate that verteporfin (BPD-MA)
localizes to the mitochondria, which agrees with earlier studies reporting
its localization to the mitochondria of pancreatic cancer cells,32 endothelial cells, and prostate cancer cells.33 There was improved mitochondria targeting of BPD-MA by using the triphenylphosphine (TPP) moiety, which
also agrees with the literature showing TPP as an effective mitochondria-targeting
molecule.24 Although guanidinium and biguanidinium
have also been used to target the mitochondria, our results demonstrate
that they reduced mitochondria localization of BPD-MA. The study by Sibrian-Vasquez et al., which showed an increased
mitochondria localization, did not quantify the localization and compare
the synthesized compounds to the unmodified porphyrins.15 Because porphyrins naturally localize to the
mitochondria, without comparison to an untargeted control porphyrin,
it is difficult to draw any conclusion regarding the ability of an
added substituent to improve mitochondria localization. Moreover,
because BPD-MA, which is a porphyrin derivative, has
already been shown to significantly localize in the mitochondria,
further improvements may be difficult.

Singlet Oxygen Species
Production
The effect of BPD-MA and its derivatives
on intracellular singlet oxygen
species generation was investigated. Previous studies have used singlet
oxygen quantum yield to compare different photosensitizers. However,
these values do not accurately predict the intracellular singlet oxygen
production, which depends on the localization of the photosensitizer
and its proximity to oxygen. Therefore, singlet oxygen sensor green
(SOSG), which reacts with singlet oxygen to produce a highly fluorescent
endoperoxide molecule, was used as a marker of intracellular singlet
oxygen production.34 Due to its low cellular
penetrance as a consequence of extracellular protein binding, the
method described by Choudhury et al. was used.35 Higher intensity of SOSG fluorescence, which corresponds
to an increase in the singlet oxygen species production, was observed
in photosensitizer-treated cells (Figure 3f–i) compared to the nontreated control
group (Figure 4a) following
irradiation. To further determine the singlet oxygen production, fluorescence
intensity was quantified36 using ImageJ’s
mean gray value (n = 75 cells) (Figure 4j). There was significantly
higher singlet oxygen production with 0317 (24 142
au ± 451.5) treatment compared to BPD-MA (21 072
au ± 423.1) treatment after light irradiation (p-value = 0.001) and with 0323 (35339 au ± 666)
treated cells compared to verteporfin (p-value <
0.0001) and 0317 (p-value < 0.0001)
treatment. Treatment with 0320 (18 674 au ±
405.5) did not show any difference from nontreated cells (17 456
au ± 442.4) (p-value = 0.3944).

cells. Statistics were done using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc
analysis. n = 75 cells for all groups. # used for
comparison with no drug, * for comparison with BPD-MA and $ for comparison with 0317. ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. It should be noted,
contrary to the previous figure, the postcapture parameters (i.e.,
LUTs) for the photosensitizer fluorescence images were constant in
this figure to provide the viewer with a visual measure of the relative
fluorescence of each molecule.

We observe the highest production of singlet oxygen species
after
irradiation of 0323-treated cells. From the previous
colocalization experiments, it was shown that 0323 had
the greatest accumulation in the mitochondria compared to the other
photosensitizers. Because the mitochondria is an organelle with the
highest intracellular oxygen concentration,9 and because oxygen is required for PDT,37 it was not surprising that the photosensitizer with the highest mitochondria
localization also had the highest ROS production. It should also be
noted that the excited state energy following near-infrared (NIR)
illumination can be dissipated by multiple mechanisms, and that compounds
that fluoresce efficiently are usually poor PDT agents and vice versa.
Thus, compounds that efficiently convert excited state energy into
emitted fluorescence must necessarily have less excited state energy
available for the production of reactive oxygen species (i.e., via
intersystem crossing, formation of singlet oxygen, and further reaction
to generate other ROS). The fact that 0323 has the lowest
fluorescence and highest ROS, whereas BPD-MA has the
highest fluorescence and the lowest ROS is consistent with this explanation.

Changes in Mitochondria Membrane Potential
Singlet
oxygen is highly reactive and damaging to membranes.39 Thus, we hypothesized that the increased production of
singlet oxygen in mitochondria will cause damage to its membranes.
To test this hypothesis, we measured the mitochondria membrane potential
(Δψm) with the JC-1 assay. JC-1 is a cationic
dye that accumulates in the mitochondria depending on the Δψm.40 During low Δψm, low concentrations of JC-1 localize in the mitochondria,
forming mostly monomers that emit green fluorescence. However, with
higher Δψm, there is an increased concentration
of JC-1 in the mitochondria, leading to the formation of JC-1 aggregates
that emit red fluorescence. Quantitative analysis of Δψm was performed by ratiometric analysis41 of green monomer (green channel) to red aggregate (red
channel) (Figure 4k).
The ratio of monomer to aggregate fluorescence was used as a surrogate
for analyzing the Δψm change. Before light
irradiation, no difference between control and photosensitizer groups
was observed, indicating no dark toxicity. As expected, the ratio
of green monomer to red complex gradually increased during longitudinal
observation for 12 min in BPD-MA-treated cells, indicating
the decline of Δψm.42 The modified compound 0323, which previously showed
the highest localization in the mitochondria and greatest singlet
oxygen production, also exhibited the largest Δψm toxicity, which was significantly higher from 6 min onward (p = 0.002 at 6 min, p < 0.0001 at 8
min, p < 0.0001 at 10 min, and p < 0.0001 at 12 min) compared to BPD-MA (Figure 4k).

Figure 4 Changes in mitochondria membrane potential. JC-1 signal in control
cells (a, b) and cells treated with BPD-MA (c, d), 0317 (e, f), 0320 (g, h), and 0323 (i, j) directly after (a–i) and 12 min (b–j) after
irradiation. (k) Green-to-red channel ratio during longitudinal study
for 12 min upon irradiation. Higher ratio corresponds to reduction
in membrane potential. 0323-treated cells show significant
reduction in mitochondria membrane potential at 6 min (p = 0.002), 8 min (p < 0.0001), 10 min (p < 0.0001), and 12 min (p < 0.0001).
Statistical analysis was done using 2-way ANOVA (n = 20 cells for time = −1 for all groups; n = 30 for nontreated group thereafter and n = 40
for photosensitizer groups). **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001.

As expected, the mitochondria membrane potential was decreased
after 690 nm irradiation in photosensitizer-treated KB cells and the
magnitude of depolarization directly correlated with the extent of
mitochondria localization. Thus, the compounds BPD-MA and 0323 had the greatest mitochondrial localization
and the highest Δψm toxicity. As noted above,
singlet oxygen species are short lived and have a diffusion radius
of only 20 nm, requiring that the location in which they are produced
also be the site where they cause the most damage. Consistent with
this, the superior accumulation of BPD-MA and 0323 in the mitochondria agrees with the greater observed damage to Δψm. Furthermore, our longitudinal study revealed a decline in
membrane potential before mitochondria swelling, suggesting this phenomenon
may be an event preceding early processes associated with apoptosis.
Because the compound 0320 did not show a significant
increase in SOS or change in Δψm in KB cells,
this compound was not further studied.

Qualitative Changes: Actin,
Mitochondria, and ROS Production
The next step in evaluating BPD-MA and its modified
derivatives was to study the morphological changes in the cytoskeleton
and mitochondria together with the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) following irradiation. Nontreated cells displayed fibrous structures
of actin filaments (Figure 5a), whereas BPD-MA-treated (Figure 5b), 0317-treated
(Figure 5c) and 0323-treated (Figure 5d) cells showed fragmentation of the actin filaments. Importantly, 0317-treated cells showed less fragmentation and more polymerized
actin than BPD-MA- and 0323-treated cells.
Granular swelling of the mitochondria, which is a sign of cell damage,
was also more prominent in BPD-MA-treated (Figure 5f) and 0323-treated
(Figure 5h) cells compared
to control (Figure 5e) and 0317-treated (Figure 5g) cells, which showed a normal tubular mitochondria
structure. There was also an increase in ROS in BPD-MA-treated (Figure 5j), 0317-treated (Figure 5k), and 0323-treated (Figure 5l) cells compared to control
cells (Figure 5i).
Curiously, the greatest increase in reactive oxygen species was found
to be in the nucleus, suggesting a significant effect of PDT on the
reactive oxygen species production in the nucleus43 and/or mitochondria nucleus retrograde signaling.44 This prediction is supported by our finding
of early signs of cell injury and pyknosis (next section)45 upon initiation of PDT. Interestingly, 0323-treated cells showed apoptotic bodies indicated by the
arrow in Figure 5l,
which will be investigated further in a section below.

We believe
that the above chain of events begins with 0323 and BPD-MA localization in the mitochondria and their subsequent
generation of reactive species, which then lead to mitochondrial membrane
depolarization and loss of its integrity. Considering the integral
role the mitochondrial membrane plays in the regulation of electrolyte
balance,46 its deterioration can be expected
to bring about a charge imbalance that will cause mitochondria swelling.
The mitochondria membrane potential is crucial for ATP production
through oxidative phosphorylation.46 Actin
assembly and disassembly, which are essential for the structural integrity
of the cell,47 molecular signaling within
the cell,48 and mitochondria motility,49,50 are dependent on ATP for their regulation. Therefore, damaging the
Δψm will lead to its depolymerization, as shown
in this study.

Analysis of Cell Death
Viability assays were then performed
using propidium iodide on photosensitizer-treated KB cells irradiated
with 690 nm light. Four different treatment groups were examined,
namely a control group, which consisted of KB cells treated with no
photosensitizer (Figure 6a) and treated groups preincubated with BPD-MA (Figure 6b), 0317 (Figure 6c) or 0323 (Figure 6d). As shown in Figure 6, after irradiation, propidium iodide staining was only observed
in photosensitizer-treated cells, with 0323 showing the
greatest cytotoxicity (93% PI positive), 0317 demonstrating
an intermediate toxicity (54% positive), and BPD-MA displaying
the lowest cytotoxicity (25% positive). Pyknosis, which involves an
irreversible condensation of chromatin, was also observed.

Figure 6 Modified compounds reduce cell viability
following irradiation.
KB cells were incubated for 1 h with either no photosensitizer or
50 nM BPD-MA, 0317, or 0323 and exposed for 5 s to the NIR laser light. After 1 h, the cells
were incubated with Hoechst dye (nuclear stain) and propidium iodide
(vitality stain) before evaluation by fluorescence microscopy. (a–d)
Merged images of Hoechst (blue) and propidium iodide (magenta) are
shown, where dead cells appear magenta.

Apoptosis Through Cytochrome C Release from
the Mitochondria
Considering the roles of mitochondria damage51 and actin network disassembly52 in mediating apoptosis, we evaluated the most effective
photosensitizer to this point (0323) and the parent compound
(BPD-MA) for the release of cytochrome C as a measure of one of the hallmarks of apoptosis. Two major mechanisms
of cell death consist of necrosis and apoptosis. Apoptosis is desirable
in PDT because it minimizes inflammation to adjacent normal tissue.53 One of the first events that occurs in apoptosis
is the release of cytochrome C from the inner membrane
of the mitochondria to the cytosol.54 Whereas
release of cytochrome C from mitochondria was prominent
in BPD-MA-treated (Figure 7b) and 0323-treated (Figure 7c) cells, little if any cytochrome C release was observed from the mitochondria in control
cells (Figure 7a).
This is consistent with previous studies, which have shown that BPD-MA induces apoptosis.55,56 Moreover,
apoptotic bodies, which are hallmarks of cell apoptosis,57 can be observed in the photosensitizer-treated
groups (see arrows). Another function of cytochrome C upon release from the mitochondria is to induce chromatin condensation
following its translocation to the nucleus.58 Interestingly, cytochrome C is localized more in
the nucleus of 0323-treated cells than in BPD-MA-treated cells. This study shows PDT with the modified compound 0323 induces apoptosis similar to BPD-MA.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a mitochondria-targeted photosensitizer
by adding a triphenylphosphine (TPP+) group to carboxyl
terminus of the parent PDT agent, verteporfin (0323).
This mitochondria-targeting moiety was more efficacious than monoguanidium
(0317) or bis-guanidinium (0320) in targeting
the mitochondria. Improving the mitochondria localization of verteporfin
resulted in increased singlet oxygen species (SOS), depolarization
of mitochondria membrane potential, and cell death. Moreover, elevated
actin depolymerization, increased reactive oxygen species, enhanced
mitochondria swelling, pyknosis, and apoptosis were also observed.
Based on these observations, we recommend tethering a TPP moiety to
the desired PDT agent when developing a photosensitizer for cytotoxic
applications.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Materials
2-(1H-7-Azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl
uronium hexafluorophosphate methanaminium (HATU) was obtained from
Genscript Inc. (Piscataway, New Jersey). Guanidine hydrochloride,
1,2-dichloro ethane (1,2-DCE), diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Trimethyltin hydroxide (Me3SnOH) was purchased from Alfa
Aesar. For the synthesis of 0323, (2-aminoethyl)triphenylphosphonium
bromide was synthesized according to reported procedures.29,30

Synthesis of Mono/Bicationic Derivatives of Verteporfin
For synthesis of mitochondria targeted monocationic derivatives of
verteporfin (1 equiv) dissolved in anhydrous DMSO containing diisopropylethylamine
(5 equiv) and HATU (1 equiv) were stirred for 30 min under argon atmosphere.
To obtain 0317 and 0323, 3-fold molar excess
of guanidine hydrochloride salt and 3-fold molar excess of (2-aminoethyl)triphenylphosphonium
bromide, respectively, were then added and stirred overnight at room
temperature, as outlined in Figure 1. The crude products were purified by preparative reverse
phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a mobile
phase of A = 20 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7; B = acetonitrile;
gradient 0–50% B in 30 min, 13 mL min–1,
λ = 280 nm. Pure fractions were analyzed by LCMS and (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) pooled
and lyophilized to furnish 0317 and 0323.

For synthesis of the polycationic derivatives of verteporfin,
we used Me3SnOH reagent for mild methyl ester hydrolysis
of verteporfin. Verteporfin (1 equiv) dissolved in anhydrous 1,2-DCE
containing Me3SnOH (10 equiv) was stirred for 1 h at 80
°C. The reaction was monitored by LCMS and the crude product
was purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC using a mobile phase
of A = 20 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7; B = acetonitrile; gradient
0–50% B in 30 min, 13 mL min–1, λ =
280 nm. The methyl ester hydrolyzed verteporfin (1 equiv) dissolved
in anhydrous DMSO containing diisopropylethylamine (5 equiv) and HATU
(1 equiv) was stirred for 30 min under argon atmosphere. A 10-fold
molar excess of guanidine hydrochloride salt was then added and stirred
overnight at room temperature, as outlined in Figure 1. The crude product was purified by preparative
reverse-phase HPLC using a mobile phase of A = 20 mM ammonium acetate
buffer, pH 7; B = acetonitrile; gradient 0–50% B in 30 min,
13 mL min–1, λ = 280 nm. Pure fractions were
analyzed by LCMS and (see Figure S3 in
the Supporting Information) pooled and lyophilized to furnish 0320. The measured extinction coefficients of the aforementioned
PDT agents were found to be 3.5 × 104 M–1 cm–1 (BPD-MA), 2.4 × 104 M–1 cm–1 (0317), and 2.2 × 104 M–1 cm–1 (0323).

Cell Culture, Plating
KB cells were
cultured with 5
mL of folic acid (−) RPMI media (Gibco) with 5% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Atlanta biologicals) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (GIbco)
in 25 mL cell culture flasks (Corning, Sigma-Aldrich). Splitting was
done 2–3 times per week or when cell culture flasks reached
about 90% confluence. Cells were plated on 4-well chambers (Nunc Lab-Tek
Chamber Slide System) in 500 μL media and allowed to grow for
2–3 days or when plates reached 90% confluence. Due to the
nature of photosensitizers, all drug and dye incubations were done
in the dark.

Following
cell plating, the
cells were co-incubated with 50 nM drug and 15 nM Mitotracker green
(obtained from Life Technologies) for 1 h in RPMI media. The cells
were then washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
kept in CO2-independent media (Life technologies) for imaging.
Because the excitation of the drug may cause morphological changes
in the mitochondria within seconds, Mitotracker green was captured
first at 488/520 nm and photosensitizers were captured at 690 nm.

Singlet Oxygen Experiment
The cells were co-incubated
with 50 nM drug and 10 μM singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG,
Life Technologies) for 1 h in FBS (−) MEM. They were washed
two times with PBS and kept in CO2-independent media for
imaging. The cells were then irradiated with 690 nm light followed
by SOSG capture at 488/520 nm.

Mitochondria Membrane Potential
Experiment
The cells
were incubated with 50 nM BPD-MA, 0317, 0320, or 0323 in RPMI for 1 h followed by two
washes with PBS. They were then incubated in 7.665 μM JC-1 (a
probe of mitochondrial membrane potential; Life Technologies) in RPMI
for 10 min followed by two washes with PBS and kept in CO2-independent media. JC-1 was captured before irradiation at 590 nm
(J-aggregates) and 529 nm (green monomers). The cells were then irradiated
with 690 nm light. JC-1 was immediately captured at 590 and 529 nm
at 2 min intervals for 12 min.

Cytoskeleton and Mitochondria
Structure Experiment
The cells were incubated with 50 nM BPD-MA, 0317, or 0323 in RPMI for
1 h followed by two washes with
PBS and kept in CO2-independent media. They were then irradiated
using 690 nm light. Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min,
permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and blocked with goat
kit31 for 60 min. The cells were then stained
with F-actin green labeling kit (Life Technologies) for 30 min, 1
μM Mitotracker deep-red FM (Life Technologies) for 30 min, and
1 μg mL–1 Hoechst for 30 min. They were then
washed two times with PBS and images were captured at 520 nm for actin,
461 nm for Hoechst, and 665 nm for mitochondria stain.

ROS Experiment
The cells were incubated with 50 nM BPD-MA, 0317, or 0323 in RPMI for
1 h followed by two washes with PBS. They were then incubated with
5 μM ROS in RPMI for 30 min followed by two washes with PBS
and kept in CO2-independent media. The cells were irradiated
with 690 nm light and ROS were captured at 488/520 nm.

Cell Death
Experiment
The KB cells were incubated with
50 nM of BPD-MA, 0317, or 0323 diluted in RPMI media for 1 h. They were washed two times with PBS
(Gibco), followed by irradiation for 5 s by the NIR laser light. After
1 h, the cells were incubated with 5 μg mL–1Hoechst dye (nuclear stain) and 1 μg mL–1propidium iodide (vitality stain) for 30 min. The cells were then
washed two times with PBS, kept in CO2-independent media,
and then imaged at 350/461 and 535/617 nm for Hoechst and propidium
iodide dyes, respectively.

Apoptosis Experiment
The cells were
incubated with
50 nM BPD-MA or 0323 in RPMI for 1 h followed
by two washes with PBS and kept in CO2-independent media.
They were then irradiated using 690 nm light and then incubated at
37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 days. The cells were then fixed
using 4% PFA for 15 min, permeablized using 1% Triton X-100 for 30
min, and blocked with a goat kit to prevent nonspecific binding for
30 min. They were then stained with 5 μg mL–1 mouse IgG anti-cytochrome C (BioLegend) for 20
h and washed three times with PBS. The cells were then counterstained
with Alexa Fluor 594 Goat antimouse antibody (594) for 90 min and
washed three times with PBS. Cytochrome C was then
captured using 617 nm emission wavelength.

Microscopy and Imaging
Analysis
Images were taken using
Nikon Ti-S epifluorescence microscope equipped with incubating chamber
set at 37 °C and an oil immersion 60× objective, and the
images were obtained with NIS-Elements software. Colocalization analysis
was done using the JACoP plugin tool in Fiji ImageJ to calculate the
Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Singlet oxygen production
analysis was done using ImageJ to obtain SOSG intensities. Fluorescence
intensity map was obtained using ImageJ. Mitochondria membrane potential
analysis was also done using ImageJ to calculate green-to-red channel
intensity ratio. For ImageJ analysis, the region of interest feature
was selected to precisely quantify the mean gray value intensity of
each cell.

Statistics
Statistical analysis
was performed using
Prism 7. One-way and two-way ANOVA were used to compare the population
mean of different treatment groups at 0.05 significant level. Tukey
post-hoc test was further applied to determine the statistical significance
of mean difference among the groups.
