==== Body
1 Introduction
Poly-1,2,3-triazole exhibits outstanding chemical stability in
hostile environments, even at high temperatures. Meanwhile, it also
retains its aromatic character, as well as the formation of hydrogen
bonds, medicinal properties, and so forth.1,2 Owing
to these features, materials based on the 1,2,3-triazole polymer have
been receiving a surge of interest for a variety industrial and medicinal
applications.3,4 The Click reaction, with obvious
development, has been extensively applied for different polymers with
front design, including telechelic star polymers, segmented copolymer,
spirodendrimers, and so on.5,6 It is crucial to expand
the application of poly-1,2,3-triazole and take full advantage of
1,2,3-triazole.7,8

In contrast, most optical
brightening agents (OBAs) are used in
textile materials, liquid detergents, and paper making.9,10 As a kind of unique OBA, stilbene derivatives possess a carbon–carbon
double bond and lose their luminescent properties under light irradiation.11,12 Therefore, it is essential to protect OBAs against direct light
to make them more stable for storage.13,14

Prior
to the preparation of bis-1,2,3-triazole,15 poly-1,2,3-triazole shows excellent thermal stability,
high solubility, and luminescent intensity.16,17 Moreover, the molecules in poly-1,2,3-triazole may form a longer
aromatic ring conjugated system, in addition to promoting whiteness
and complementary effect.18,19 In addition, incorporation of chiral 2(5H)-furanone in the polymers is an effective approach to improve their
antifungal activities,20,21 chemical durabilities, and thermostabilities.22,23 Also, with the help of chiral 2(5H)-furanone, the
polymers may be added onto the coating surface more easily.24,25 On the basis of our previous research,15,26 novel polymers, 2, possessing multifunctional moieties
are synthesized by the Click reaction (Scheme 1), and their structures and properties are
determined by IR spectra, 1H NMR, gel permeation chromatography
(GPC), UV, ultraviolet protection factor (UPF), and the water-laundering
test.

2 Results
and Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, an important
design principle was
to control the ratio between dialkynyl and diazido, aiming at improving
the photostability of the OBAs (Scheme 1). The incorporation of 2(5H)-furanone
gave rise to the larger steric effect, thereby avoiding photoisomerization
and, in turn, effectively improving the light stability of the OBAs, 2, as well as increasing their UPF values.12 The following discussions on the properties show these
fluorescent brightening effects, which are indeed as expected.

2.1 Characterization
The structures of
the acquired polymers, 2, were confirmed by 1H NMR and IR spectra. According to the 1H NMR spectra
(Figure S1), the singlet peak in the region
of 5.30–5.31 ppm belonged to the characteristic peak of 5H in the 2(5H)-furanone unit. The disappearance
of the signal corresponding to −C≡C–H (δ
= 2.65 and 2.68 ppm) showed that the Click polymerization between 1 and DASS was realized successfully.33 Furthermore, the diagnostic 1,2,3-triazole proton
resonance for samples 2 was observed as a singlet at
7.39 ppm (Figure S1).12

As shown in Figure S2,
the stretching vibration bands of ≡C–H (3273 cm–1) and N3 (2091 cm–1)
from the monomers became much weaker after polymerization. This indicates
that most of the acetylene and azide functional groups from monomers 1 and DASS were expended via the Click polymerization
and changed into triazole rings in polymer 2.34 At the same time, the N–H groups exhibited
stretching absorption in the range of 3410–3432 cm–1, whereas the unsaturated groups (C–H) from these aromatic
and 1,2,3-triazole rings displayed stretching absorption in the 3074–3153
cm–1 range.35 The intensive
stretching band (C=O) was located in the range of 1747–1754
cm–1, with the most intensive stretching band (C=C)
appearing in the range of 1639–1654 cm–1.36 In addition, the skeletal stretching vibrations
of aromatic rings were absorbed in the region of 1490–1561
cm–1. Also, the intensive stretching band (S=O)
was located in range 1182–1197 cm–1,37 and the rocking vibration from the unsaturated
C–H bond in the trans-olefin moiety was located in the range
947–968 cm–1.31

In addition, the Mn (number average
molecular weight) of polymers 2a–e appeared in the region of 1.21–9.31 kDa and their polydispersity
indexes (PDIs) varied between 1.18 and 1.25 (Figure 1), reflecting the formation of a conjugated
molecular skeleton with a high molecular weight. The corresponding
data are summarized in Table 1. Indeed, the best polymerization result of an Mn of 9.31 kDa and a 98.7% yield (Table 1, polymer 2c) was achieved when
the molar ratio of monomer 1 and DASS was
1.1:1.2. An increase in the concentration of either monomer 1 or DASS lowered the Mn, as higher monomer concentration could the hinder intermolecular
monomer collisions, thereby lowering the polymerization results.38 All of the polymers exhibited good solubilities
in organic solvents, including tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), and dimethylformamide (DMF), as listed in Table 1, possibly due to the incorporation
of alkyl chains from menthol and sodium salt.39,40

2.2 Thermal Properties
Generally, polymers
containing conjugated or cross-linked structures tend to be thermally
stable and are also good candidates for textile material.41 Thermal properties of polymeric products 2a–e were determined by thermogravimetric
analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the data
are summarized in Table 2. Figure 2 displays
the thermal degradation of these polymers when these were gradually
heated from 50 to 700 °C. The degradation temperatures (Td) at the point of 5% weight loss were located
in the region of 207–315 °C. Noticeably, polymers 2a–e retained more than 50% of their weights
at temperatures over 700 °C. It was implied that they have a
much better thermal stability than many commercial polymeric materials.42 As revealed by the high glass-transition temperatures
(Tg, 126–235 °C), all of the
samples showed high morphological stability (Figure 3).31 Among them, 2c displayed the maximum stability (235 °C), as shown
in Table 2. Consequently,
the Tg decreased while the monomer ratio
changed from 1.1:1.2. This may imply that interactions between side
chains or the side chain and main chain reduced the Tg values in cases in which the speed of the Click polymerization
slowed due to steric retardation with the azide moiety. Moreover,
CuI-catalyzed Glaser homocoupling of the acetylene moiety
to generate diacetylene could turn into a side reaction.43,44

2.3 UV–Visible (Vis)
and Fluorescence Spectra
The UV–vis and luminance
spectra of polymeric products 2a–e in aqueous solution are shown in Figure 4. Their UV–vis
absorption spectra displayed two bands at about 263–271 and
360–397 nm (Figure 4a). Upon light irradiation (λ = 360–397 nm),
the emission maxima were shown at about 388–440 nm (Figure 4b) for those specimens
separately. A similar trend was observed for polymers 2a–e, whose quantum yields (Φ) are given
in Table 2.

Figure 4 Normalized
UV–vis (a) and PL (b) spectra of samples 2a–e.

2.4 Influences
of pH Values
For the purpose
of investigating the acid-fastness of polymers 2a–e, the fluorescence response of these samples were evaluated
at five different pH values, and then, the pH was regulated with HCl
or NaOH.45Figure S3 shows that their emission intensity decreased with a decrease in
the pH value because protonation of the 1,2,3-triazole moiety and
sulfonic groups by a strong acid mainly narrowed the quenching process
and resulted in enhanced overall intensity.46

As shown in Figure S3, in acidic solutions
of all specimens, obvious redshifts in the emitting maximum in the
range of 478–512 nm occurred at pH 1. These redshifts in the
acid system were attributed to the changeable highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps,
which disrupt the ordered molecular packing.47 In addition, a larger gap between HOMO and LUMO ascribed to aromatic
hydrocarbon and aliphatic amine interactions also influenced the electron
density in the OBA system.48

In contrast,
all of them exhibited mildly reduced emission intensities
in alkaline solutions than in acidic solutions (Figure S3). The emitting bands of polymers were blue-shifted
in the range from 428 to 466 nm. The shift may be arising from
the disruption between the 2(5H)-furanone moiety
and the amino acid ester in the system.15 Moreover, these hydrolyses will not only induce the trans–cis
conversion (Scheme 2) more easily but also cause cleavage of the polymer structure, even
influencing the fluorescence property and leading to blueshifts.48

Scheme 2 Photoisomerization of Polymer 2
2.5 XPS Analysis
Information on the electronic
structure and chemical composition of polymer 2c was
obtained by XPS analysis,49 as given in Table 1. A survey of the
spectra of 2c shows that peaks are located at 929.4,
573.8, 532.3, 400.5, 289.6, and 163.7 eV, which are (Br 2s), (O 1s),
(N 1s), (C 1s), and (S 2p), respectively, implying the high purity
of the prepared samples.50Figure S4 shows that the C (1s) spectra were
consistent with carbon–nitrogen (285.5 eV) and carbon–sulfur
(286.7 eV) environments. Meanwhile, the peak binding energies of the
S (2p3/2) and S (2p1/2) components were consistent
with C–SO3H (sulfonate) environments and the signal
at 398.2 eV corresponding to N=N–C sp2-hybridized
N atoms in the triazole ring (Figure S4)51 demonstrated a successful Click polymerization
between monomer 1 and DASS. These results
matched with other characterization information, strongly suggesting
the model polymeric products.

2.6 Photoisomerization
The polymeric
products having stilbene-type chromophores have cis and trans isomers.
Generally, the trans state of the stilbene molecule is more stable
than the cis state.3 As shown in Figure 5, the UV–vis
spectra of multiblock copolymers 2a–e were measured in THF solution. According to Figure 5, their most intense absorption bands were
below 280 nm in the ultraviolet region, arising from the π–π*
transition localized on the 2(5H)-furanone ring within
each polymer. The next weaker broad band, which appeared at approximately
350 nm, can be ascribed to the trans-stilbene sulfonate
moiety.4 The UV–vis spectrum of
these samples at UV 365 nm light irradiation exhibited a decrease
in the high-intensity band at 350 nm along with a slight bathochromic
shift to 340 nm owing to the trans-to-cis photoisomerization.52

Figure 5 UV–vis spectral changes of polymers 2a–e in THF upon UV light irradiation as a function
of time:
(a) irradiation time = 60 min; (b) irradiation time = 180 min; (c)
irradiation time = 300 min; (d) irradiation time = 120 min; (e) irradiation
time = 90 min.

Importantly, although
a balance can be reached between cis and
trans isomers of polymers 2a–e, the
time of achieving their respective photostationary state is distinctive.53 Among these, polymer 2c reached
a photostationary state in 240 min with irradiation at 365 nm. Notably, the time far exceeded that
for pre-bis-1,2,3-triazole (80 min)15 owing
to OBA’s main chain with multichiral units restraining the
trans-to-cis conversion for 2c.53 In other words, the trans-to-cis photoisomerization rate of 2c was at least 10 times higher than that of other samples,
even that of stilbene sulfate itself. The main reason was that both
monomer 1 and DASS in the 2c system had undergone complete Click polymerization. However, further
increase in DASS content led to a significant decrease
in photoability, which may be attributed to an increase in the absorbance
and scattering of photons due to excess DASS in the polymer
system.54

2.7 Evaluation
of UPF
Aimed at studying
the anti-UV ability of untreated cotton clothes and those deposited
with 2a–e, UPFs were determined and
are given in Table 3.55 More UV rays could pass through the
original fabric, leading to a relatively high transmittance, with
a corresponding UPF value of only 6.032. After treatment with polymers 2a–e, the transmittance of the samples
decreased, with an obvious enhancement of UPF. Apparently, as the 2a–e concentrations increases, the UPF
of the cotton fabric increased. When the concentration increased to
0.2% (o.w.f.), the UPF was over 20. It was shown that these polymeric
products are extraordinarily suitable for protecting against harmful
UV rays.56 Among them, 2c offered
the maximum protection, with a UPF value that far exceeded that of
pure fabric. Furthermore, when 0.5% (o.w.f.) 2c was added
to the cotton fabric, the UPF increased to more than 51 (Table 3). Significantly,
the UPF value in this case was larger than that in the previous study
(UPF = 42.358),15 which accounted for OBAs’
main chain with multichiral units, thus restraining the trans-to-cis
conversion in 2c.55 Afterward,
the UPF value reduced with an excessive amount of FBAs. The reason
for this phenomenon is that the light filtered by the excess FBAs, the high
agglomeration of FBAs may block the active sites on the surface of
the polymers.30 These results are also
in agreement with those of previous photoisomerization tests.

2.8 Water-Laundering Test
After demonstrating
the outstanding UV protection ability of 2c, we also
measured the water durability of fabrics deposited with polymer 2c.57 The additional water-laundering
durability test was carried out for 10 min without any recovery treatment.
As illustrated in Figure 6, the fabric showed significant stability and the UPF value
did not decrease significantly even after eight cycles of water laundering.
Subsequently, the UPF of specimen 2c reduced from 51.553
to 50.492 after 10 cycles, and the UV (UV-A and UV-B) transmittance
increased slightly by nearly 1%. However, the water-laundering durability
of previous bis-1,2,3-triazole15 maintained
for just three cycles (Figure S5) and decreased
quickly afterward. Eventually, the UPF value of the small molecule
dropped to 2.925 after 10 cycles of water laundering. Obviously, the
water-laundering durability of polymer 2c is far higher
than that of the previous bis-1,2,3-triazole molecule. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the introduction of poly-1,2,3-triazole can
not only produce polymer 2c-consolidated cotton fabrics
with ultrastrong UV-defending ability but also provide extraordinary
water-laundering durability.58,59

3 Conclusions
A simple and effective method was successfully developed to prepare
poly-1,2,3-triazoles by one-pot Click polymerization of diyne and
disulfonyl azide. These polymerizations utilize the
advantages of Click reactions, such as outstanding efficiency, mild
reaction, inexpensive catalyst, and good atom economy. The obtained
polymers possess high UPF values as well as good thermal stability.
In particular, when the diynes/disulfonyl azide ratio was 1.1/1.2,
the highest Mn of copolymer was 9.31 kDa.
With FBA moieties, the
polymers display fluorescence-brightening characteristics. Moreover,
their strong photostationary state features make them promising materials
in textile, pulp, and paper making.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Equipment
Among the
solvent and reagents (analytical grade), sodium 6,6′-(ethene-1,2-diyl)bis(3-azidobenzenesulfonate)
(DASS, ≥98.0%) was acquired from TCI, whereas
intermediate 1, containing 2(5H)-furanone
moiety, was synthesized according to the literature.15,27

All of the fusing points were measured by Yuhua X4 fusing
point equipment (Gongyi, China) and were uncorrected. IR spectra were
recorded on an FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker Tensor 27 Fourier transform
infrared). 1H NMR spectra were recorded in DMSO-d6 on a Bruker DRX-400 MHz spectrometer, and
tetramethylsilane served as an internal standard.

Both Mn and the corresponding molecular
weight distribution for polymeric products 2a–e were measured by GPC with THF as the solvent under the testing
conditions given below. Polystyrene worked as the reference material
at 35 °C, with a flow velocity (1 mL min–1).

DSC was determined by thermal analyzer (Perkin-Elmer DSC7, Norwalk,
CT).

The thermal stability of polymers 2a–e were determined on a thermogravimetric
analyzer using NETZSCH STA 409 PC to ensure that the samples were
stable at high temperatures of up to 700 °C.28

The chemical compositions of these specimens were
analyzed by XPS
(Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos) equipment.

The UV absorption peaks
were measured using an ultraviolet absorption
detector (Shimazu UV-2550). The luminance spectrum was obtained using
a Hitachi F-2500 spectrophotometer. UPF values was determined using
a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimazu UV-2550) equipped with
an optimum and a fabric-supporting device.15,29

The water-laundering durability of the fabric was measured
by the
AATCC Test Method 61-2006. The size of the fabric was 50–150
mm, and the measuring environments were as follows: the specimens
were laundered in a closed canister (200 mL) with WOB (AATCC Standard,
0.37% w/w) for 45 min at a heating temperature of 40 ± 5 °C.
Subsequently, the UPF of the fabric specimen was measured again under
various washing times, simulating from 10 to 100 wash processes, that
is, between 1st and 10th cycle.30

UV–vis spectra were recorded on an absorption spectrophotometer
(Hitachi U-3010). Luminance spectra were recorded on a fluorescence
spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4500). In addition, the solid luminance
quantum yields (ϕPL) were obtain using calibrated
integrating sphere equipment.29

4.2 Synthesis
All Click polymerizations
were preceded by a standard Schlenk technique under nitrogen. First,
monomer 1 and DASS were blended in an anticipative
molar feed ratio (Table 1) in a Schlenk tube (10 mL) equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Subsequently,
CuI (0.02 mmol), DMF (0.5 mL), and Et3N (0.04 mmol) were
added. After stirring at ambient temperature for 1 h, the copper salts
were laundered and the crude product was obtained through precipitation
in methanol. The mixture was further purified in a Soxhlet extractor
with methanol overnight, followed by drying in vacuum overnight.31,32
