Various nanostructured
amorphous silicas [fumed silicas such as
crude (A-300), hydro-compacted (cA-300, TS 100), and precipitated
silica Syloid 244] were modified by different polydimethylsiloxanes
such as PDMS5, PDMS100, PDMS200, PDMS1000, and PDMS12500 (the label
numbers show the viscosity (η) values) using dimethyl carbonate
(DMC) as a siloxane-bond-breaking reagent. In addition, hexamethyldisilazane
was used to modify fumed silica cA-300. The nanocomposites were characterized
using microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, thermodesorption, nitrogen
adsorption–desorption, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, small-angle
X-ray scattering, and zeta-potential methods. It was found that the
morphological, textural, and structural characteristics of silicas
grafted with PDMS depend strongly not only on the type and content
of the polymers used but also on the organization of nonporous nanoparticles
(NPNP) in secondary structures (aggregates of NPNP and agglomerated
aggregates, ANPNP), as well on the reaction temperature (Tr). Specifically, we determined that ANPNP with a macro/mesoporous
character are favorable for the effective modification of the silicas
studied with short polymers and no DMC addition but at higher temperatures
or for a longer silicone polymer with the presence of DMC and at lower
temperatures. In particular, the PDMS/DMC-modified silicas are of
great interest from a practical point of view because they remain
in a dispersed state with no strong compaction of the secondary structures
after modification, and this corresponds to a better distribution
of the modified nanoparticles in polymeric or other matrices.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nanostructured amorphous silicas (NAS) can be synthesized under
different conditions1−8 affecting their morphological, structural, textural, and other characteristics.
For example, fumed silicas are synthesized (using, e.g., SiCl4 as a precursor) at high temperatures in an O2/H2/N2 flame, precipitated silicas are synthesized
(using, e.g., sodium silicate) in liquid media at relatively low temperatures,
and thermosilica is synthesized using fumed silica hydrated and treated
at high temperature. These materials with similar values for their
specific surface area (SBET) may have
structural and textural characteristics1−13 that differ in some ways and are similar in others. We can assume
that the results of the chemical modification of various NAS by the
same modifiers, as well as the results of modification of the same
NAS by different modifiers may therefore be different. This aspect
is analyzed in the present work with respect to the hydrophobization
of a set of NAS by different polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMSs) alone or
with the presence of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as a reagent for Si–O
bond cleavage.

Hydrophobized NAS are of interest from a practical
point of view
because these materials are better fillers of nonpolar or weakly polar
polymers as well as being more appropriate for other practical applications
than hydrophilic NAS.1,8−23 Therefore, a deeper insight into the problem of hydrophobization
of various NAS by various modifiers is of importance. The morphological,
textural, and structural features of various NAS can strongly affect
the results of hydrophobization: the degree of hydrophobization (θ),
possible length of hydrophobic functionalities, and changes in the
porosity and SBET, and so forth.14−25 Clearly, these aspects are of importance because the hydrophobization
of NAS influences not only the structure of a solid surface but also
other characteristics and properties of the materials.1−13,26−29 Different modifiers with low-molecular
weight (MW) can be applied for the hydrophobization of NAS, such as
organosilanes [(CH3O)xSiR4–x], chlorosilanes (ClxSiR4–x, where
R = CH3 or other organic functional groups), and hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDS).29−35

To enlarge the hydrophobic functionalities attached to a surface,
NAS hydrophobization may be carried out using organosiloxane with
the presence of DMC. This modification results in a greatly thicker
functional layer13,36−41 than that obtained upon modification using short silanes, as mentioned
above, that is of importance for fillers of polymers. However, the
textural characteristics (porosity and pore size distribution (PSD))
can play a more important role than in the case of short molecules
of modifiers. The characteristics of the modifiers and modified surfaces
can strongly affect not only the interactions of modified NAS (used
as fillers) with polymers but also the morphology and texture of modified
surfaces (and even the solubility of silicas).8,9,27 Thus, the modification of fillers can strongly
affect important physicochemical characteristics of the final materials.
Notice that cyclic organosiloxanes can be applied for the SiO2 surface modification, but much higher reaction temperatures
are required than with linear PDMS and the presence of DMC catalyzing
the decomposition of PDMS into more reactive fragments.

The
physicochemical properties and characteristics of modified
NAS3,8−12 strongly depend on the surface distribution and structure of the
attached functionalities, their amounts, the degree of substitution
of surface OH groups by grafted functionalities [e.g., Si(OR)(CH3)2, Si(CH3)3],8,11 the fragments of depolymerized PDMS, and so forth.13,28,34,35,39−41 Clearly, features of
unmodified NAS (e.g., particulate morphology, porosity, PSD, etc.)
can affect the modified material properties.3−12 For fumed NAS, the size distribution of the nonporous nanoparticles
(NPNP), SBET, textural porosity of NPNP
aggregates and agglomerates of aggregates (ANPNP), and chemistry (e.g.,
content of surface hydroxyls) are important factors for interactions
with PDMS/DMC. The properties of unmodified and modified NAS depend
on the organization of ANPNP.41−50 ANPNP features depend on the morphology and synthesis route of NAS
and the determining NPNP bonding in the secondary structures, as well
on the constitution of a functional layer at the surface of unmodified
and partially or completely modified SiO2 nanoparticles.
The distribution of the surface hydroxyls (initial and residual after
surface modification) and grafted functionalities on modified SiO2 surfaces can change the properties of NAS-filled polymers.1−10,51−61 Thus, it is of interest (and this is the aim of our study) to elucidate
the influence of the characteristics of unmodified NAS of various
origins [fumed initial (A-300), hydro-compacted at low (cA-300) and
high (TS 100) temperatures, and precipitated (Syloid 244) silicas]
on the results of hydrophobization by PDMS alone (short PMS5) or DMC-depolymerized
longer PDMS (PMS100, PMS200, PMS100, and PMS12500), depending on the
MW of PDMS, as well as to compare NAS modified by HMDS [at different
reaction temperatures of Tr = 80 °C
(HMDS), 200, 220 °C (PDMS/DMC), or 250 °C (PMS5), selected
depending on the reactivity of the modifiers]. Note that different
aspects of the interactions of PDMS-hydrophobized silicas with water,
as well as other adsorbates, have been analyzed elsewhere.41,50,62−65 Typically, uniform hydrophobic
surfaces, for example, modified by PDMS fragments, are characterized
by a contact angle for settled water drops not greater than θc = 120°. Nano/microstructured hydrophobic particles (structures)
can provide much larger θc—up to 170°
due to a surface geometry factor.66,67 Thus, hydrophobic
nanostructured systems may be considered as a part of more complex
systems with a complex geometrical, particulate morphological hierarchy.66−68 However, the effects of different organization of various nanostructured
silicas composed of NPNP upon hydrophobization by various PDMS alone
or with the presence of DMC have not been previously studied.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
Five
silicas were employed
as follows: (i) fumed silica A-300 (Pilot Plant of Chuiko Institute
of Surface Chemistry, Kalush, Ukraine) preheated at 450 °C for
2 h (label A in samples) to remove water and other compounds adsorbed
from air; (ii) preheated A-300 hydro-compacted with addition of distilled
water (1:2 w/w), stirred for 10 min, and then heated at 105 °C
for 8 h (label cA); (iii) fumed silica A300 (Evonik) preheated at
450 °C for 2 h (label AE); (iv) silica TS 100 (Evonik Ind.) based
on fumed silica strongly agglomerated due to treatment at high temperature
(label T); and (v) Syloid 244 (precipitated silica, Grace Davidson,
label S). These were subjected to hydrophobization by PDMS. Five PDMS
were used: PMS5 (WACKER AK 5 silicone fluid, viscosity η ≈
5 mm2/s, label P1); PMS100 (WACKER AK 100 silicone fluid,
η ≈ 100 mm2/s, label P2); PMS200 (“Kremniypolymer”,
Zaporozhye, Ukraine, η ≈ 200 mm2/s, label
P3); PMS1000 (WACKER AK 1000 silicone fluid, η ≈ 1000
mm2/s, label P4); and PMS12500 (WACKER AK 12500 silicone
fluid, purity > 99%, η ≈ 12 500 mm2/s at 25 °C, density of ca. 0.97 g/cm3, label P5).
Note that the PDMS viscosity (see the Supporting Information) depends strongly on the MW, and this could be
affected by the coil-like shape of the polymer chain.51,69 The MW values are ca. 815, 6004, 9670, 28 000, and 67 700
g/mol for PMS5, PMS100, PMS200, PMS1000, and PMS12500, respectively.
Clearly, the structural features of PDMS can affect the chemical modification
of various silicas (having different textural characteristics) by
PDMS of different lengths due to several factors (vide infra).

Several silicas were functionalized using the same amounts of reagents
of PDMS + DMC (2 g PDMS and 2 g DMC per 10 g SiO2) at a
temperature range of 100–250 °C in gaseous dispersion
media (see Tables 1 and S1 in the Supporting Information).
The samples demonstrating better results (in terms of the degree of
hydrophobization) versus T were selected for subsequent
detailed investigations.

b The values of Vnano and Snano, Vmeso and Smeso, and Vmacro and Smacro were computed
by integration of the fV(R) and fS(R) functions
at 0.35 nm < R < 1 nm, 1 nm < R < 25 nm, and 25 nm < R < 100
nm, respectively. The values of ⟨RV⟩ and ⟨RS⟩ as the
average pore radii were calculated as a ratio of the first moment
of fV(R) or fS(R) to the zero moment (integration
over the 0.35–100 nm range) ⟨R⟩
= ∫f(R)R dR/∫f(R) dR. The values of the average nanoparticle radius
(r) were calculated as r = 3/[SBET × (ρ0,SiO2 × CSiO2 + ρm × Cm)], were ρ0,SiO2 = 2.2 g/cm3, ρm = 0.97 g/cm3, Cm is the relative
content of a modifier. Zeta potential (ζ) values were determined
in THF/water (1:1) solution.

The content of the grafted organic (CC and CH in Table 1) groups in the modified NAS was measured
twice by a Vario MACRO cube analyzer (Elementar, Germany) in order
to estimate average values for carbon and hydrogen content and relative
deviations.

2.2 Scanning and Transmission
Electron Microscopy
A scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
study (Figures S3–S6) of the obtained
materials was performed
using a FE-SEM (Hitachi S-4700, Japan) equipped with a standard secondary
electron (SE) detector at an operating voltage of 15 kV at the magnification
range of ×5000 to ×100 000.

A transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) (Figures 1, 2, S1, and S2) analysis was performed using a TECNAI G2 F30 microscope
(FEI-Philips, Holland) equipped with a high-angle annular dark field
detector at an operating voltage of 300 kV. The powder samples were
added to acetone (chromatographic grade) and sonicated. A drop of
the suspension was then deposited on a copper grid with a thin carbon
film. After acetone evaporation, sample particles remaining on the
film were studied.

Small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of initial A-300, hydro-compacted
silica cA-300, and modified cAP3D (Figure 3) was performed using
an Empyrean (PANalytical, Netherlands) diffractometer with Cu Kα
radiation (with a parallel-beam X-ray mirror with a W/Si crystal)
using a transmission mode with scans over the 0.115°–5°
range at a step of 0.01° using a continuous-scan mode at 293
K. Prior to the analysis, the samples were placed on a 6 μm
Mylar film, levelled and gently kneaded by hand. Beam weakness was
measured after passing through the sample, then corrected taking into
account the background observed calculating the absorption factor
of each sample. SAXS patterns were studied using the PANanalytical
EasySAXS V. 2.0.0.405 program (with the purpose of particle-size distributions
(PaSDs) calculation).

samples.

2.4 Textural
Characteristics
To study
the textural properties of synthesized samples all samples were degassed
at 180 °C for 12 h (Table 1). Low-temperature (77.4 K) nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms (see Figure S7 in Supporting Information) were recorded using an ASAP 2460 adsorption analyser (Micromeritics
Instrument Corp., USA). The specific surface area (Table 1, SBET) was calculated according to the standard BET method.70 The total pore volume (Table 1, Vp), pore-size
distributions (PSD), and differential PSD as dV/dR were calculated as it was described previously in refs71−73 and in Supporting Information, Figure
S8.

2.5 1H MAS and 29Si CP/MAS
NMR Spectroscopy
Solid-state 29Si CP/MAS NMR (Figure 5 and S9b) study of the synthesized materials was performed
using a Bruker AVANCE 400 III HD spectrometer (Bruker, USA, magnetic
field strength of 9.3947 T) with cross-polarization (CP), magic-angle
spinning (MAS), and high-power 1H decoupling. The powder
samples were poured in a pencil-type zirconia rotor of 4.0 mm o.d.
The spectra were recorded at a spinning speed of 8 kHz (4 μs
90° pulses), a 8 ms CP pulse, and a recycle delay of 4 s. The
Si signal of tetramethylsilane (TMS), assuming for this a 0 ppm shift,
was used as a reference for the 29Si chemical shift for
the silicas studied.

Solid-state 1H MAS NMR (Figures 6 and S9a) study
of the synthesized materials was performed on a Bruker AVANCE 400
III HD spectrometer (Bruker, USA, magnetic field strength of 9.3947
T). The powder samples were poured in a pencil-type zirconia rotor
of 4.0 mm o.d. The spectra were recorded at a spin speed of 10 kHz
and a recycle delay of 1 s. The adamantane was used as a reference
for the 1H chemical shift.

2.6 Infrared
Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra
were recorded using a Specord M-80 spectrophotometer (Carl Zeiss,
Jena, Germany) in the 4000–300 cm–1 wavenumber
range. The obtained materials were pressed into rectangular 28 ×
8 mm plates of 25 mg weight. A FTIR Bruker spectrophotometer coupled
with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) tool using a diamond crystal
was also used. To record spectra in the range 4000–1200 cm–1, the composites obtained were pressed into thin pellets
(15–20 mg) and the transmittance spectra were recorded with
4 cm–1 step. To record spectra in the range 2000–300
cm–1, the samples were mixed with KBr (Sigma-Aldrich,
for spectroscopy) as 1:400, stirred and pressed into thin pellets.

2.7 Zeta Potential
A Zetasizer Nano ZS
instrument utilizing a 632.8 nm HeNe laser was used to study average
zeta potential (Table 1, ζ). Measurements were performed using a Malvern “dip”
cell kit in a tetrahydrofuran (THF)/water mixture (50/50) at 20 °C.
Three runs were taken for each sample in order to calculate average
values and related errors.

3 Results
and Discussion
Initial and pretreated fumed silicas are characterized
by relatively
similar values for the specific surface area (Table 1, SBET = 242–305
m2/g) and the average radius of primary nanoparticles (r ≈ 4.5–5.5 nm). However, precipitated silica
Syloid 244 is composed of smaller NPNP (r ≈
3.6 nm) but stronger aggregated (see Figure S2). The organization of NPNP in the secondary structures, ANPNP significantly
differs for the silicas studied (Figures 1, 2, and S1–S6), and this results in large differences
in the volumes of mesopores (Table 1, Vmeso) and macropores
(Vmacro), as well as in the average radius
of pores with regard to the pore volume (⟨RV⟩) and the pore size distributions (PSD) [Figure 4 (incremental PSD)
and Figure S8 (differential PSD)]. This
factor could be of importance in interactions with PDMS. However,
the bulk density of modified A-300 changes insignificantly, for example,
ρb = 0.047, 0.056, 0.047, and 0.050 g/cm3 for A-300, cAP3D, AP4D, and AP5D, respectively. This is matching
with the TEM images (Figure 1) of A-300 and related modified fumed silicas with no strong
compaction of the secondary structures (note that stronger compaction
results in greater ρb values). For other silicas,
the modification does not result in great changes in the compaction
of the secondary structures (Figures 2 and S2–S6 in the Supporting Information), despite a certain increase in the r values (Table 1).
These results are of importance for the application of these composites
as fillers for various nonpolar media (e.g., polymers), since strong
compaction of ANPNP can lead to a worsened and nonuniform distribution
of filler particles in the polymer matrices. This can lead to impairment
of the mechanical and other characteristics of the final materials.
Note that the secondary structures of Syloid 244 (precipitated silica)
look like more strongly compacted (see Figures S2 and S6 in Supporting Information) than for other silicas
such as cA-300 or TS 100 undergoing compaction treatments at low and
high temperatures. However, Syloid 244 has a maximal SBET value and a minimal r value (Table 1) among the silicas
studied. Therefore, the contents of attached hydrophobic functionalities
(Table 1, CC + CH) for samples SP3D and
cAP3D are similar. It is worth mentioning that nanopores (voids between
adjacent NPNP in ANPNP at R < 1 nm in pore radius)
are practically absent (Table 1, Vnano, Snano, Figures 4 and S8, PSD) in the unmodified and modified
silicas. This is of importance for effective silica modification as
nanopores are poorly accessible for relatively large PMDS molecules
or their fragments.

The values of ⟨RV⟩ >
25 nm and Vmacro > Vmeso (Table 1), as well the PSD (Figure 4, PSD maxima at R > 25 nm) suggest that
the
organization of ANPNP corresponds to meso/macroporous materials rather
than to mesoporous ones. This could be of importance for SiO2 surface modification by the polymer fragments (formed as a result
of interactions with DMC), as the surfaces of NPNP are better accessible
in broad mesopores and macropores than in narrow mesopores or nanopores
(voids between NPNP in ANPNP), whereas for TS 100 and Syloid 244, Vmacro < Vmeso, but ⟨RV⟩ > 25 nm.
Thus,
both these compacted silicas are characterized by significant macroporosity.

The modification of NAS by short PDMS (PMS5 at an average degree
of polymerization of ca. 11), long PDMS (but with DMC addition used
to cleave the Si–O bonds in PDMS), or HMDS typically leads
to reduction of the values of Vp and SBET (Table 1) and an increase in the average radius (r) of nanoparticles. However, changes in the values of the textural
characteristics of mesopores and macropores are different for modified
A-300 (A and AE series) and other silicas (cA, T, and S series) due
to the differences in the PSD of the unmodified silicas (Figure S8e,f), reflecting the organization of
ANPNP. However, changes in the NPNP per se after additional treatment
of nanosilicas (e.g., hydro-compaction A-300 → cA-300 and A-300
(AE) → TS 100) are not significant. For example, SAXS analysis
of the PaSDs for A-300 and cA-300 shows similar curves with the same
position for the PaSD maximum (Figure 3), which shifts toward larger values due to cA-300
functionalization (cAP3D). This is in agreement with the changes in
the r values (Table 1) computed from the nitrogen adsorption isotherms.
It should be noted that hydro-compaction (cA-300) or PDMS/DMC modification
(cAP3D) of A-300 results in a diminishing ANPNP contribution (Figure 3, r > 10 nm), in comparison to unmodified A-300. In other words,
both
processes cause a certain amount of decomposition of ANPNP (see e.g., Figure 2a,b).

The difference
in the organization of secondary structures, ANPNP
causes certain changes in the adsorption of water from air (Figures 7 and S10–S14, a broad IR band at 3500–3250
cm–1). Adsorbed water partially remains after preheating
(see the IR spectra of preheated samples in the Supporting Information). This effect depends also on the structure
of the silica surface hydroxyl layer. This appears in variations in
intensity of 1H MAS and 29Si CP/MAS (Q3—SiOH, Q2—Si(OH)2) NMR spectra
of unmodified silicas (Figures 5, 6, and S9) and also in the values of zeta potential (Table 1, ζ), which becomes less negative due
to surface hydrophobization upon substitution of silanols, which is
responsible for the surface charging versus pH, for example, pH at
negative charging > pH at point of zero charge, by nonpolar functionalities.
For example, samples A-300 (hydrophilic) and A-300/PMS5 (hydrophobic)
are characterized by the ζ potential of −4.2 and −0.9
mV, respectively. However, there is no linear dependence of ζ
potential on the CC value as a certain
measure of the hydrophobicity of modified surfaces (see Table 1) due to the structural features
of a modifier layer depending on a type of PDMS and reaction conditions,
as well as structural features of the silicas studied.

Figure 7 The IR spectra (in the
3800–1350 cm–1 range)
of cA-300 unmodified (preheated at 105 and 450 °C) and modified
by P3D (cAP3D) and HMDS (cAH).

Thus, features in the organization of NPNP in ANPNP (Figures 1–3 and S1–S6) and changes in the
porosity and specific surface area in the ranges of mesopores and
macropores (Table 1, Figures 4, and S8), as well as changes in the concentrations
of surface silanols (single ≡SiOH and twin =Si(OH)2) can affect the hydrophobization of NAS by various silicones.
This appears first in the different content of the attached hydrophobic
functionalities (Table 1, CC, and CH). Second, the length of PDMS plays a very important role in the
degree of hydrophobization (Table 1, Figures S11–S15). As a whole, the effects of PDMS length on the degree of hydrophobization
can be explained by several factors, such as: (i) longer molecules
are characterized by lower molecular mobility due to stronger molecule–molecule
or molecule–nanoparticle interactions (the η value increases
for a polymer alone); (ii) penetration of longer molecules into narrower
pores is strongly restricted because longer linear molecules tend
to form clews; (iii) longer molecules generate greater steric barriers
for interaction of DMC with a silica surface and neighboring PDMS;
and (iv) surface-attached longer PDMS fragments produce greater negative
effects (umbrella screening) on the possibility of other fragments
becoming attached to neighboring active surface sites.

The barriers
generated by longer PDMS molecules or their fragments
are well seen in the incomplete substitution of surface silanols (the
θ values decreased by 14–50% in comparison to the reaction
of silica with short PMS5 or HMDS, Figures S11–S14). In addition, these factors result in a diminution of intensity
of the D2 (Si(CH3)2) line in the 29Si CP/MAS NMR spectra and also the incomplete disappearance
of the Q2 (Si(OH)2) line at −91 ppm (Figure 5) or 1H MAS NMR at δH = 4–5 ppm (related to silanols
and bound water) (Figure 6). For AP1 and AEP1, the intensity of the D2 line
is maximal and the Q2 line at −91 ppm is not observed
(Figure 5), as well
as the line of silanols/water at δH = 4–5
ppm (Figure 6). The
IR and NMR spectral features correspond to complete substitution of
surface silanols by hydrophobic functionalities generated by PMS5
reacted with a silica surface with no DMC (but it is optimal at slightly
higher temperatures). These results are close to the ones obtained
upon modification of cA-300 by HMDS (Figures 5 and 6) at lower temperature.
However, the total weight of the attached trimethylsilyl (TMS) groups
(upon reaction of HMDS with cA-300) is much smaller than that after
the reaction of PMS5 with A-300 (Table 1, CC + CH). Therefore, from a practical point of view, PMS5 could
be preferable to HMDS for nanosilica hydrophobization in spite of
the higher temperatures of the reaction.

There is a general
tendency for an increasing θ value (corresponding
to better hydrophobization62−65) with an increase in the reaction temperature from
100 to 250 °C (Figures S11–S14). However, this effect could be decreased with increasing length
of PDMS, for example, for AP2D, θ = 0.67 and 0.86, and for AP5D,
θ = 0.60 and 0.63 at the reaction temperature of 100 and 200
°C, respectively (Figure S11).

4 Conclusions
Various nanostructured silicas (fumed silicas
such as initial (A-300,
A300) and hydro-compacted (cA-300, TS 100) and precipitated silica
(Syloid 244) were modified by different PDMS using DMC as an initiator
of the Si–O bond splitting. HMDS was used to modify cA-300.
Investigation of the materials using microscopy, infrared spectroscopy,
thermodesorption, nitrogen adsorption–desorption, solid state
NMR, SAXS, and zeta-potential methods show that the morphological,
textural, and structural characteristics of modified silicas depend
greatly on the type and content of the modifiers employed and on the
organization of NPNPs in secondary structures, as well as on the reaction
temperature. The results reveal that functionalization with PMS5 alone
(Tr = 250 °C) leads to a higher degree
(θ > 0.95) of silanol substitution. The SBET reduction is larger, and the silanol groups that remained
at the silica surface after its modification are mainly absent as
compared with the results for longer PDMS/DMC reactions occurring
at 200–220 °C, giving θ = 0.50–0.86 and a
larger SBET value. For nonporous particles
of fumed silica, better modification by shorter PDMS is not trivial
because the material is rather macroporous with only the textural
porosity caused by voids between NPNPs in soft secondary structures.
The texture of crude NAS studied is favorable for effective surface
modification both by short organosiloxane (e.g., PMS5 giving CC = 8.2 wt % (A300) or 9.1 wt % (A-300) at 250
°C) alone or for longer polymers with the presence of DMC. Silicas
TS 100 and Syloid 244 modified by PMS200/DMC demonstrate similar CC values (∼5 wt %) but smaller than that
(5.4 wt %) for hydrocompacted cA-300 modified by PMS200/DMC.

Overall, the PDMS/DMC-modified nanostructured silicas could be
of interest from a practical point of view, as they remain in a dispersed
state with no strong compaction of the secondary structures after
the functionalization that is appropriate for better distribution
of the modified nanoparticles in various polymer matrices or other
nonpolar media.
