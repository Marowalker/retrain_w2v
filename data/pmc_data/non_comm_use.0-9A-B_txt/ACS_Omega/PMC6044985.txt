Chemical
ecology has grown as a scientific discipline from its
earliest days of tracking the exquisitely potent chemistry of insect
pheromones to a deep understanding of the molecular, physiological,
and behavioral interactions governed by naturally occurring small
molecules. The current practice of the field relies on knowledge of
genomes and gene expression patterns, protein biology, and small-molecule
chemistry, providing illustrations of ecological and evolutionary
patterns in natural communities.

Some 65 years
ago, one of us
elucidated the structure of nepetalactone,11 a novel monoterpene in the essential
oil of the mint species, Nepeta cataria, commonly called “catnip” (Figure 1). This is a compound that intrigues not
only domestic cats but also leopards, cougars, lynxes, lions, and
tigers, inducing a variety of playful behaviors. The significance
of these behaviors is unknown, and the plant/animal chemical interaction
it represents remains a minor mystery. Nevertheless, the realization
initially by biologists and much later by chemists that organisms
can respond behaviorally as well as developmentally to small molecules
emitted by other organisms has given rise to a highly diversified
and fundamentally important body of science at the interface between
chemistry and biology. We would like this perspective to encourage
present and future colleagues to explore this subject of biotic chemical
communication in new and exciting directions.

that function in ecological interactions
among living organisms.

To introduce the subject about how organisms gain information
about
their environment, we might ask how we humans know what is going on
around us? Most obviously, we look and we listen. We sense the properties
of our environment through a small number of distinct channels. The
information we gather plays a crucial role in enabling us to react
adaptively to changing conditions. Which information-gathering channels
are particularly influential in the lives of each species depends
on their natural history. Although we depend heavily on sight and
sound to learn about their environment, we are also sensitive to changes
in ambient temperature and to information gathered by our sense of
touch.

In addition to these, there are the chemical senses,
taste and
smell, which are unique because they depend on the generation, transmission,
detection, and characterization of molecular entities. They are important
to just about all species, from microbes to mammals. The study of
how organisms interact chemically in nature has come to be called
chemical ecology. This discipline is of importance to areas of human
endeavor as diverse as medicine, agriculture, forestry, and environmental
sustenance, but it is still in its infancy. Although few researchers
consider themselves chemical ecologists, anyone working on bacterial
quorum sensing (microbial chemical ecology2), the human microbiome, plant-fungal symbiosis, vector-borne diseases
of plants or animals, insect defense mechanisms and pheromonal communication,
the control of agricultural pests, bark beetle/forest relationships,
red tides, and countless other chemical interactions in nature is
contributing to this field.

Chemical ecology is a six-decade-old
discipline3 with roots two centuries old.
On 6 May 1870, French naturalist
Jean-Henri Fabre incarcerated a newly emerged great peacock female
moth, Saturnia pyri, to discover, after
a few experiments, that she produced a scent undetected by the human
nose, which was a powerful attractant for males of the same species.4 Soon after that, New York entomologist Joseph
A. Lintner reached a similar conclusion while observing the spicebush
silk moth, Callosamia promethea. He
then envisioned a practical application for these scents and reached
out to chemists for help: “cannot chemistry come to the aid
of the economic entomologists in furnishing at moderate cost the odorant
substances needed?”5 It is highly
unlikely that he was aware that bola spiders were already producing
moth sex pheromones to attract male moths, the first pheromone-based
attract-and-kill system.6 Evidence also
suggests that Sir John Ray noted that the female peppered moth, Biston betularia, attracted males with her scent.77 Prior to Fabre’s
experiments, other pioneers in chemical ecology, including Ernst Stahl,
had already suggested the importance of plant secondary metabolites
in plants’ interactions with the environment, including herbivorous
insects. Their ideas were rejected by contemporary physiologists who
dominated biological research at the time.8 Science is neither a democratic process in which the majority wins,
nor a popularity contest. It may take time to convert skeptics and
for the minority to prevail.

Chemical ecology sensu stricto
started when, after three decades
of research, Adolf Butenandt unraveled the chemistry of the female
scent from the silkworm moth that attracts males: (10E,12Z)-hexadeca-10,12-dien-1-ol (common name, bombykol; Figure 1).9 After all, chemical ecology is the study of the chemical
languages, cues, and mechanisms controlling interactions among living
beings, including communication among individuals of the same species
and between organisms and their environment.3 Butenandt envisioned that unraveling the chemistry behind moth attraction
would open an entirely new field of research. Because they have now
embarked on “language studies”, they first needed a
dictionary to catalogue technical terms. Karlson and Butenandt10 coined the term pheromone to describe a chemical
signal like the silkworm moth’s scent that Butenandt had discovered.
Then, they and others started adding more entries like semiochemicals,
literally meaning chemicals that carry signal/excitement. The term
pheromone refers only to semiochemicals involved in communication
between individuals of the same species, but could be separated into
alarm, aggregation, and sex pheromone. The cousin to the term pheromone,
allelochemicals, refers to communication between different species.
For example, a plant-derived compound may fend off herbivorous insects
and, therefore, is named allomone because it benefits the producer
(emitter). Flowers’ semiochemicals that attract pollinators
are called synomones because they benefit both emitter and receiver.
A parasitoid may use a pheromone signal to find a host; thus, in this
context, the semiochemical is called kairomone because it benefits
the receiver and is disadvantageous to the emitter. The chemical vocabulary
in chemical ecology built up rapidly. As with any other languages,
the definitions have been refined over time. The accepted term for
aggregation pheromone for sex procurement is now aggregation-sex pheromone.1111

On the advice
of one of us and about a century after Lintner’s
appeal, the New York Agricultural Experiment Station (Cornell College
of Agriculture) recruited a charismatic chemist, Wendell Roelofs,
and the State University of New York at Syracuse hired Robert (Milt)
Silverstein to launch a chemical ecology program. Roelofs, Silverstein,
and many other chemists throughout the world started deciphering at
a large pace chemical communication among various agricultural pests,
particularly moths, and helping economic entomologists develop new
trapping, attract-and-kill, and mating disruption strategies. As chemical
ecology gained momentum, evolutionary entomologists started accepting
the work of Stahl and others and recognized the essential role of
plant secondary metabolites in plant–insect interactions, thus
broadening the field.8

As many sex
pheromones were characterized and synthesized, physiologists,
ethologists, and neurobiologists were excited to join and broaden
the field of chemical ecology to study multiple facets of insect chemical
communication. Neurophysiologists, first within the group of Dietrich
Schneider, identified single cells in insect antennae that detect
pheromone constituents and demonstrated how multiple chemical signals
are integrated in the brain. Schneider developed the electroantennogram
and single sensillum recording (SSR) techniques, which help unravel
the remarkable sensitivity and selectivity of the insect’s
olfactory system.12,1312,13 When combined
with gas chromatography (e.g., gas chromatography-electroantennographic
detection (GC-EAD), GC-SSR), these techniques also facilitated the
identification of new pheromone systems. In the 1970s, Schneider joined
one of us (JM), Carl Djerassi, Thomas Odhiambo, and Koji Nakanishi
to launch the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology
and to bring chemical ecology to the African continent. Subsequently,
many chemical ecology centers of excellence were formed throughout
the world, which are epitomized by the Max Planck Institute for Chemical
Ecology founded in 1996. Thus, chemical ecology research has been
performed on all continents, including Antarctica, wherever scientists
can observe and access organisms for experimentation.

Using
wind tunnels and synthetic pheromones, ethologists were able
to dissect the intricacies of odorant-mediated navigation in insects.
The uniqueness of the insect’s olfactory system triggered the
interest of biochemists and molecular biologists. Chemical ecology
is now addressing the molecular basis of insect olfaction, although
the pioneer of the “molecular basis” was indeed Butenandt.
In the last three decades, we learned that the reception of pheromones
and other semiochemicals in insects is mediated by olfactory proteins,
particularly odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), which are also named
pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) when the odorant is a pheromone:
odorant receptors (ORs), odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs), ionotropic
receptors (IRs), and sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs).1414 The roles of IRs
and SNMPS are still to be fully elucidated. OBPs and PBPs bind hydrophobic
odorants and form binding protein–semiochemical complexes that
help solubilize the odorants for proper transportation through the
aqueous environment in sensilla in peripheral organs like antennae,
maxillary palpi, and others. OBPs are essential for the sensitivity
of the insect’s olfactory system and may play a part in selectivity,
although ORs are the ultimate gatekeepers of selectivity.a Once a signal is conveyed, it must be terminated rapidly,
with ODEs assisting at least in part with inactivation via enzymatic
degradation.

To identify semiochemicals for possible applications
in agriculture
and medical entomology, chemical ecologists apply bioassay-guided
approaches for the isolation of active ingredients, which may be augmented
with electrophysiological approaches, such as gas chromatography-electroantennographic
detection (GC-EAD). Although GC-EAD may provide a “shortcut”
to the active ingredients, a solid and consistent bioassay is still
needed to avoid false-positives. A compound may generate an electrical
signal and be behaviorally inactive. The explosive advancement in
our understanding of the molecular basis of insect olfaction in the
last two decades opened the door for reverse chemical ecology, a term
coined for the screening of olfactory proteins as another shortcut
toward active semiochemicals.15 In short,
olfactory proteins are identified from the genome of a receiver and
utilized as molecular targets to fish out potential attractants rather
than isolating these attractants from the sender (as in conventional
chemical ecology approaches). This noninvasive process is particularly
suitable for studying endangered species as well as those species
whose behavior leads to cumbersome bioassays for isolation and identification
of active ingredients. Recently, OBPs identified in the genome of
the giant panda (Figure 2) have been used in binding assays to identify putative sex pheromones
and to gain a better understanding of how this vulnerable species
interacts with the environment.16 Similarly,
ORs have been used to screen a library of compounds to select, on
the basis of OR activation, mosquito oviposition attractants.17−19 Like the use of GC-EAD, a bioassay to confirm function is still
needed, but is now performed with a reduced number of samples. Additionally,
this reverse chemical ecology approach may lead to discovery of physiologically
relevant compounds, which would never be identified using a conventional
chemical ecology approach. One such example is the discovery of Orco
agonist, N-(4-ethylphenyl)-2-[(4-ethyl-5-pyridin-3-yl-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)sulfanyl]acetamide,
VUAA-1 (Figure 1).20 It is highly unlikely that this compound from
a library of non-natural products would ever lead to measurable behavior
because VUAA-1 cannot activate the intact olfactory system due to
its low volatility. Yet, its discovery opened new avenues for the
study of OR interactions and functions.

Figure 2 In a reverse chemical
ecology approach, odorant-binding proteins
(OBPs) have been recently used to study chemical communication in
the giant panda. Putative sex pheromones were identified on the basis
of their affinities for OBPs as well as structural features of OBP–ligand
interactions. Illustration created by Steve Oerding (UC Davis, Information
and Educational Technology, Academic Technology Services).

Although our understanding of the molecular basis
of terrestrial
insect communication has grown dramatically, chemical communication
in aquatic insects lags behind. For those insect species, like mosquitoes,
with immature larvae living in an aquatic environment and adults being
terrestrial, we have learned a great deal about how adults communicate
with the environment and find oviposition sites, but little progress
has been made toward elucidating chemical communication in the aquatic
environment. This differs remarkably from our current knowledge of
the chemical communication in the sea.

Although the creatures
living in the world’s oceans look
very different from those on land and are surrounded by water rather
than air, chemistry is just as important a tool for communication
under water as above it. Molecules produced by one organism travel
through water to be sensed by others or act in surface-mediated interactions
enabling a wide range of organisms to interpret the world around them.
For example, marine bacteria seeking to form biofilms on algal surfaces
are thwarted by halogenated furanones secreted from algal pores that
confuse bacteria and interrupt their production of biofilm matrix
(Figure 1).21 Tiny mud crabs hiding in the interstitial spaces
between oyster shells read the risk of predation by larger blue crabs
via the chemical signature of their predator’s urine, judging
a predator most dangerous if its urine is rich in trigonelline and
homarine, associated with consumption of mud crabs (Figure 3).22 In other words, tiny animals can chemically sense what their predators
have recently eaten and behave most cautiously around predators whose
last meal was one of their own kinds.

urine induces fear in prey organisms, with prey behavioral response

Even single-celled algae called
phytoplankton appear to have a
“nose” for sensing the chemistry of their enemies, without
having a true nose (or any organs at all). These plantlike cells receive
and transmit chemical information, which shapes the continent-sized
marine ecosystems they inhabit. Phytoplankton are responsible for
approximately half of Earth’s photosynthesis and represent
a major food source for animals living in the open ocean. Some phytoplankton
congregate to form massive blooms, visible from space, whose individual
cells manufacture toxins that harm marine animals. These toxins are
diverse and complex in their molecular structures, consisting of products
of polyketide (e.g., brevetoxin B), isoprenoid, and amino acid biosynthesis
(e.g., domoic acid and saxitoxin), with most such molecules produced
by only one or a few algal species and found only in certain aquatic
habitats (Figure 1).
The chemistry of toxic algae has a rich history of discovery coupled
with detective work to uncover biological function: the impacts of
exposure to algal toxins have been explored mostly in the context
of neurological risk to human health and marine wildlife. It is not
clear to biologists why phytoplankton evolved to produce such toxic
chemicals, although one hypothesis is that these toxins function as
chemical defenses against specific predators such as microscopic animals
(zooplankton). Zooplankton including copepods feast on a wide variety
of phytoplankton, but appear to avoid certain toxic species; in some
habitats, copepods have evolved partial tolerance of toxins in their
diets after many generations of exposure to toxic algae.23,24

How do zooplankton sense algal toxicity, to avoid consuming
these
otherwise nutritious cells? It is possible that predatory copepods
directly sense algal toxins via chemoreceptors on their antennules,
but those toxins typically remain inside algal cells, whereas copepods
reject certain kinds of toxic cells without swallowing them. Perhaps
zooplankton sense other features of toxic algae, such as surface glycoproteins
or diffusible odors associated with toxic cells. Chemosensory processes
of marine organisms are poorly understood compared to their terrestrial
counterparts, but play a substantial role in marine ecosystem function.

Like copepods, phytoplankton also possess chemosensory capabilities,
responding to their copepod predators much the way mud crabs do to
metabolites in their blue crab predators’ urine. When phytoplankton
sense enhanced concentrations of copepod-specific taurolipids (e.g.,
copepodamide A; Figure 1), which are probably unavoidable products of copepod digestion,
this predator-specific information triggers a response that varies
for each kind of phytoplankton.25,26 Some phytoplankton
respond to copepod cues by severing connections among chains of cells,
releasing individual cells, which are less obvious to copepods than
chains of multiple cells.27 Others respond
to small, ciliated predators by growing large colonies that cannot
be engulfed by predatory ciliates.27,28 A few phytoplankton
species upregulate their own toxicity upon sensing copepod cues, further
discouraging predators from consuming them.29 As with the fear induced in mud crabs when exposed to predator urine,
the most powerful response in phytoplankton comes from exposure to
copepods that have recently eaten phytoplankton.

In fact, it
has long been known that the toxicity of algal blooms
is highly variable worldwide, and only in the last decade has it become
apparent that a substantial portion of that variation is due to chemical
sensing of predator risk. It appears that phytoplankton have evolved
to turn up their toxicity when it is most needed, an example of induced
defense, which has been frequently observed among trees, shrubs, and
herbs in response to insect attack. Although planktonic creatures
have been studied by scientists since the first microscopes revealed
their intricate and diverse forms, the taurolipids excreted by copepods
that phytoplankton use to measure risk were unknown until 2015. Since
their discovery, these compounds have been detected at picomolar concentrations,
potent enough to induce phytoplankton toxicity and break up chains,
in ocean water around the world. It turns out that microscopic marine
organisms are more sensitive chemists than those of us with mass spectrometers
and high-performance liquid chromatographs in our labs. To discover
a new class of compounds with planetwide environmental impacts, we
had to follow the noses of the phytoplankton.

How do phytoplankton
sense copepod odors, without a true nose?
They must have receptors that have yet to be discovered, which allow
them to interpret the information from zooplankton exudates, turning
on the phytoplankton’s biosynthetic apparatus for toxin production,
chain disruption, colony growth, and other behaviors or physiological
changes that have yet to be discovered. At the foundation of this
complex biology is simple communication of small molecules diffusing
through the water column. Answering these questions
will allow scientists to better predict the toxicity of algal blooms,
how much of the Earth’s fixed carbon will be consumed in the
oceans, in what circumstances to expect the evolution of algal toxicity
and the evolution of resistance in predators. Research in chemical
ecology will lead us to greater insights into the molecular mechanisms
of cellular biology and animal behavior.

We are just beginning
to pay close attention to the fact that small
molecules are constantly carrying valuable bits of information by
land, sea, and air. Chemists working in collaboration with organismal
biologists are continually discovering completely new interactive
roles played by small molecules. Right now, in part as a consequence
of limited funding opportunities, the level of research effort devoted
to chemical ecology is shockingly small. The International Society
of Chemical Ecology has fewer than a thousand members, whereas the
American Chemical Society boasts more than 150 000. Yet numerous
critical scientific questions remain, including how the earliest occupants
of our planet interacted via chemical signals and cues, how pheromones
have contributed to human social organization, and how chemical communication
among microbial constituents of our own guts regulates human health
and behavior. We know that knowledge of chemical ecological interactions
is essential to our understanding of the biotic world. We also know
that the application of chemical ecological ideas to current problems
in medicine, agriculture, forestry, and many other human endeavors
can have enormous applied consequences. Perhaps we will even one day
figure out what those cats are doing!

a ORs form ion channels with obligatory
odorant receptor co-receptors, Orco, which are embedded in the dendritic
membrane of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs, also referred to as
olfactory sensory neurons, OSN). Signal transduction starts once semiochemicals
interact with OR units forming these ion channels.
