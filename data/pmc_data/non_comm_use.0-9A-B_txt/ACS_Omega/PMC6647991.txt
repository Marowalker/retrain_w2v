Considerable effort
has been devoted recently to replace platinum-based
catalysts with their non-noble-metal counterparts in the oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Nitrogen-doped carbon structures emerged
as possible candidates for this role, and their earth-abundant metal-decorated
composites showed great promise. Here, we report on the simultaneous
formation of nitrogen-doped graphene and iron nitride from the lyophilized
mixture of graphene oxide and iron salt by high-temperature annealing
in ammonia atmosphere. A mixture of FeN and Fe2N particles
was formed with average particle size increasing from 23.4 to 127.0
nm and iron content ranging from 5 to 50 wt %. The electrocatalytic
oxygen reduction activity was investigated via the rotating disk electrode
method in alkaline media. The highest current density of 3.65 mA cm–2 at 1500 rpm rotation rate was achieved in the 20
wt % catalyst via the four-electrode reduction pathway, exceeding
the activity of both the pristine iron nitride and the undecorated
nitrogen-doped graphene. Since our catalysts showed improved methanol
tolerance compared to the platinum-based ones, the formed non-noble-metal
system offers a viable alternative to the platinum-decorated carbon
black (Pt/CB) ORR catalysts in direct methanol fuel cells.

Introduction
Anthropogenic global
warming is one of the greatest challenges
of humankind today. Its effect could be attenuated by replacing fossil
fuels with more sustainable resources. To this end, fuel cells can
be of utmost importance as they can convert green fuels like hydrogen,
methanol, ethanol, formic acid, etc. into electricity in a carbon
neutral manner.1 The fuel is oxidized on
the anode side separated by a thin polymeric membrane from the cathode
side, where the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) takes place. ORR also
plays a crucial role at metal–air battery cathodes.

Porous
carbon-supported platinum and platinum-based alloys were
the traditional catalysts of choice for ORR in fuel cells. There are
some practical issues with using platinum-based catalysts in fuel
cells, though. Since oxygen reduction kinetics is sluggish, high amounts
of costly precious-metal catalysts are needed. A further issue in
direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) is the so-called methanol crossover
through the ion-exchange membrane. Platinum catalyzes both ORR and
methanol oxidation (MOR), and the CO intermediate of the latter reaction
poisons the catalyst surface. This reduces the durability and performance
of the catalyst and therefore the whole cell.2

Finding efficient ORR catalysts is challenging. Several non-noble-metal
catalyst systems have been proposed as platinum alternatives, like
transition-metal carbides,3 oxides,4 chalcogenides,5 oxynitrides,2 or nitrides.6 In group
4–6 transition-metal nitrides, the high ORR activity is caused
by D-band contraction: the higher electron density near the Fermi
level makes electron donation to the adsorbed oxygen easier.7 According to previous reports, the most active
transition-metal nitrides are cobalt and iron nitrides.8−10 The fact that these catalysts usually work better in alkaline than
in acidic media results in a higher interest from the alkaline membrane
fuel cell field.11

A further aspect
to be considered regarding sustainability in green
energy research is geopolitical availability. As it is not directly
connected to materials science, it is often overlooked by scientists
in this field, justifying the usage of cobalt instead of precious
metals in their studies. It has to be emphasized that more than half
of the world’s cobalt mine production in 2017 (∼58.2%)
came from one single country, while the next largest producers supplied
at an order of magnitude lower annual rates (∼4–5%).
Both the unstable political situation of the largest producer and
the highly unbalanced nature of the cobalt market can threaten the
global supply chain. Along with the rising demand for Li-ion battery
cathodes, cobalt prices increased by almost a factor of 3 between
November 2015 and January 2018 on the London Metal Exchange (LME)
“owing to strong demand from consumers, limited availability
of cobalt on the spot market, and an increase in metal purchases by
investors” as concluded by the U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral
Commodity Summaries, January 2018.12 Moreover,
“growth in world refined cobalt supply was forecast to increase
at a lower rate than that of world cobalt consumption, which was driven
mainly by strong growth in the rechargeable battery and aerospace
industries. As a result, the global cobalt supply was expected to
remain limited in the near term”.12 Therefore, iron seems to be a safer choice for producing non-noble-metal
catalysts for the industry in the long run.

Several iron nitride
synthesis methods have been reported in the
literature so far. They are often based on the pyrolysis of transition-metal
salts with nitrogen-containing molecules or polymeric organic precursors.
Zhang et al. made porous polyaniline-derived FeNxC/C catalysts by using iron chloride as the precursor of
iron nitride and carbide.13 Wang et al.
mixed an iron oxide/graphene aerogel composite with urea and thermally
treated it in argon atmosphere to obtain an iron nitride/nitrogen-doped
graphene (NG) composite.14 Chen et al.
treated the mixture of iron chloride, glucose, and melamine first
in nitrogen and then in ammonia/nitrogen atmosphere to get an iron
nitride/nitrogen-doped carbon structure.15 Park et al. tested several precursors to synthesize iron nitride
by ammonia treatment and found that the as-prepared nitride from iron(III)
acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3) showed the best oxygen reduction
reaction activity in contrast to that obtained from ferrocene (C10H10Fe), iron chloride (FeCl3), iron
sulfate (FeSO4), and iron(II) acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)2).16

Another type of non-precious
metal ORR catalyst is the so-called
metal-free catalysts. Typical representatives are carbon nitride,17,18 boron nitride,19,20 or heteroatom-doped (nitrogen
or sulfur) carbon structures, like carbon nanotubes or graphene.21−26 Nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) is one of the most widely investigated
heteroatom-doped carbon structures due to its advantageous physical–chemical
properties and high ORR activity in both acidic and alkaline media.25,27,28 Density functional theory calculations
by Zhang et al. revealed the role of carbon atoms with incorporated
nitrogen atom neighbors in facilitating oxygen adsorption and hence
promoting the ORR reaction. Pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen moieties
were identified as key elements for the latter effects.29,30

Nitrogen-doped graphene composites can be synthesized using
various
approaches. Ma et al. and Tao et al. synthesized NG composites hydrothermally
from either ammonia or urea mixed with graphene oxide,31,32 whereas Zhu et al. co-annealed graphene oxide with polypyrrole.33 Nitrogen-doped graphene can also be produced
by chemical vapor deposition using methane as the carbon source and
ammonia as the nitrogen source in the reaction. The resulting materials
showed good ORR activity, accompanied with high stability and methanol
tolerance.25 Zheng et al. used a hydrothermal
approach to treat the mixture of urea and graphene oxide, and the
as-prepared NG exhibited a higher ORR activity than nondoped graphene.
Even so, the activity of the widely used Pt/carbon black (CB) catalysts
is difficult to surpass using non-noble-metal catalysts.34 A further possible preparation pathway toward
nitrogen-doped graphene is the reaction of ammonia with pristine graphene
oxide at high temperatures.35

In
this report, we present a simple, one-step synthesis method
to prepare nitrogen-doped graphene decorated by iron nitride particles.
To this end, the mixture of graphene oxide and iron(III) acetylacetonate
with different ratios was annealed under ammonia atmosphere, resulting
in the simultaneous formation of iron nitride and nitrogen-doped graphene.

Structural and morphological differences in the composites were
investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
The electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared composites was studied
using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) method in alkaline medium,
and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was utilized to obtain electron-transfer
numbers for the reaction. The methanol tolerance of the composite
with the highest ORR activity was tested along with a noble-metal
Pt/CB catalyst.

Results and Discussion
Morphology
Transmission
electron microscopy was used
to characterize the morphology of the as-prepared composites. Figure 1a–d shows
that well-dispersed particles were grown onto the surface of the two-dimensional
graphene surface after thermal treatment. The diameter of these particles
increased with increasing iron content. According to the inset graphs
in Figure 1a–d,
average particle sizes of 23.4 ± 9.2, 78.2 ± 33.8, 105.1
± 56.4, and 127.0 ± 41.8 nm were found for 5, 10, 20, and
50 wt % iron contents, respectively. In the absence of graphene, 309.6
± 109.1 nm iron nitride particles were formed (Figure 1e).

Figure 1 TEM images of the FeNx/NG samples with
various weight percents of iron (a–d), and the pristine iron
nitride particles synthesized without the presence of graphene oxide
(e).

Larger particles in Figure 1d were formed by the merging
of primary grains. This is also
discernible in Figure 1e, but with increased particle size and wider size distribution.
This happens because the precursor salt can disperse well over the
graphene oxide surface, which in turn yields more dispersed iron nitride
nanoparticles during the salt decomposition under ammonia atmosphere.

Structure
The crystal structure of the composites,
stand-alone iron nitride, and nitrogen-doped graphene was investigated
with X-ray diffractometry. As Figure 2a shows, a mixture of FeN and Fe2N was formed
during the ammonia treatment. A reflection at 35.7° can be assigned
to the (111) plane of FeN,36 while the
additional reflections at 43.1, 57.1, and 63.1° correspond to
the (011), (012), and (003) planes of Fe2N (JCPDS 01-072-2126).37 A similar result was reported in a previous
study by Yin et al.38 The intensities of
these reflections are lower in the case of low iron nitride content.
The reflection at 26.6° can be assigned to the layered structure
of nitrogen-doped graphene.39

Figure 2 (a) X-ray diffractograms
and (b) Raman spectra of the FeNx/NG samples
with varying iron contents.

Raman spectra in Figure 2b show Stokes G- and D-bands at 1586 and 1347 cm–1, respectively. Both are characteristic features of
carbonaceous
materials. The D-band correlates with the degree of structural defects
in the carbon structure, while the G-band is associated with the Raman
active vibrations of sp2 carbon atoms, i.e., with the graphitic
domains of the graphene structure.40 The
intensity ratio of the D- and G-bands was found to be 1.02 in the
case of NG. Somewhat higher, but constant values of 1.05, 1.06, 1.05,
and 1.06 occurred in the case of composites with 5, 10, 20, and 50
wt % iron contents, respectively. These values are in good agreement
with the literature data on nitrogen-doped graphene composites.31 The observed ratios imply that the amount of
defects and/or the incorporated nitrogen atoms in the graphene structure
could be higher in the composites than in the pristine nitrogen-doped
graphene. This result agrees well with the literature data. Choi et
al. showed that the presence of iron could promote the incorporation
of nitrogen into the carbon structure.41 Further peaks were observed at 217.9, 280.8, and 391.2 cm–1. These peaks correspond to the iron nitride phase.42

The initial condition of the catalysts was characterized
by ex
situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Some of the measured spectra
are depicted in Figure 3. The high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum of the 20% composite in Figure 3a shows peaks at
711.1 and 724.6 eV. These correspond to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 photoelectron lines of Fe(III), while their corresponding
satellite peaks can also be observed at 719.7 and 733.2 eV.37 These Fe(III) species can interact with nitrogen
or oxygen to form FeNx or iron oxides.43 The same was obtained in other iron nitride
composites, as it can be seen in Figure S1a,c,e,g. Although it refers to an iron oxide phase, it was not detected
in the XRD patterns (Figure 2a), as most likely, only a thin layer was formed due to surface
oxidation. Similar findings were reported in other systems too.37,44 The proof of nitride formation can be seen in Figure 3b, though. Since the N 1s peak of iron nitride
was recorded in the absence of graphene, it was deconvoluted into
three features at binding energies of 398.6, 400.6, and 404.1 eV.
The first peak corresponds to the bonding between the nitrogen and
iron atoms, while the second and third peaks indicate the presence
of adsorbed ammonia and nitrogen oxide species, respectively.44 The iron/nitrogen ratio in iron nitride was
calculated to be 1.7:1. This agrees well with the XRD analysis above
and confirms the formation of the FeN–Fe2N mixture.

particles synthesized without the presence of graphene oxide. O 1s
(c) and (d) N 1s spectra of the FeNx/NG
composite with 20 wt % iron content.

O 1s spectra show a hydroxyl feature at 532.3 and the sign
of carboxyl
groups at 534.8 eV binding energies in Figure 3c. The latter peaks could appear in the spectra
because of water and carbon dioxide molecules adsorbed on the surface,
and/or they could also be due to various functional groups of graphene
oxide that remained intact during the ammonia treatment.45,46 A further peak at 530.5 eV corresponds to the iron–oxygen
interaction37 and thus serves as an additional
proof for oxide layer formation on the particle surface. Azuma et
al. investigated the surface of a sputtered transition-metal nitride
and found that there was a thin surface layer containing oxygenated
groups. When the surface was etched with Ar+ ions, the
O 1s peak was weakened.47 Similar differences
in the O 1s spectra for the nitrogen-doped graphene, iron nitride-decorated
composites, and iron nitride particles can be seen in Figure S2.

Various nitrogen moieties can
be formed by the incorporation of
nitrogen into the carbon structure during the ammonia treatment of
graphene oxide. Figure 3d shows the deconvoluted N 1s spectrum of iron nitride/nitrogen-doped
graphene composite with 20 wt % iron content. Features at 398.7 and
400.7 eV can be assigned to the pyrrolic- and pyridinic-type nitrogen
moieties, respectively. Several theoretical and experimental studies
revealed that the incorporation of pyrrolic- and pyridinic-type nitrogen
species improves the ORR activity of carbon structures.25,29,30,48,49 According to previous reports and the small
difference between the binding energies of pyridinic-type and iron-bonded
nitrogen, we concluded that the peak at 400.7 eV should also include
the contribution of nitrogen, which was bonded to iron.50 The additional peaks at higher binding energy
evidence the presence of oxidized pyridinic-type nitrogen moieties.51 Similar results were obtained from the N 1s
spectra of nitrogen-doped graphene and composites with different iron
contents in Figure S1b,d,f,h. The atomic
ratio of nitrogen and carbon in the graphene structure was calculated
from the XPS images and is depicted in Figure S3. N/C increased from 0.098 to 0.122 as the iron content of
the composite increased from 5 to 20%. However, the N/C ratio dropped
upon any further increase in the iron content. It was also documented
in the literature in, e.g., iron oxide/carbon nanotube41 or iron oxide/nitrogen-doped graphene composites.52

Electrocatalytic Activity
Alkaline
electrocatalytic
oxygen reduction activity was tested in 0.1 M KOH using cyclic voltammetry
(CV) (Figures S4 and S7a) and linear sweep
voltammetry (LSV). Figure 4a shows that the current density was increasing with increasing
rotation rate in the 20 wt % iron-containing sample, and Figure S5 demonstrates the same trend for the
other working electrodes. Linear sweep voltammograms at 1500 rpm rotation
rate are compared in Figure 4b. The onset potentials of the 5, 10, and 20 wt % iron content
samples were similar and around 0.90 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE))—slightly more positive than that of the pristine nitrogen-doped
graphene (0.87 V (vs RHE)). Further increase in the iron content,
however, decreased the onset potential: 0.84 and 0.69 V (vs RHE) were
found for the 50 wt% iron containing composite and for pristine, graphene
oxide-free iron nitride, respectively. The obtained reduction current
densities at 1500 rpm rotation rate (recorded at 0 V (vs RHE)) are
summarized in Figure 4c. The composites with 5, 10, and 20 wt % iron contents have higher
current densities than the stand-alone nitrogen-doped graphene (2.70
mA cm–2) and iron nitride (2.21 mA cm–2). The highest reduction current density (3.65 mA cm–2) was reached at 10 and 20 wt % iron contents. However, even higher
current densities were achieved in the 20 wt % iron-containing composite
at more positive potentials between 0.1 and 0.8 V (vs RHE). The performance
of the 5 wt % iron-containing composite (3.32 mA cm–2) falls between that of the iron-free and the best performing catalysts.
A similar trend manifests in the onset potentials: the 50 wt % iron
composite featured a lower current density than the other composites
with lower iron contents. These results imply that the ORR activity
of iron nitride can be improved by decreasing its particle size. Nitrogen-doped
graphene as a support material can prevent particle aggregation besides
exhibiting an inherent ORR activity as well. These findings are consistent
with the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results. The N/C atomic
ratio of nitrogen-doped graphene was higher at 20 wt % iron content,
which in turn implied that there may be more incorporated nitrogen
atoms in the graphene structure. This resulted in a higher number
of catalytically active sites in the graphene surface.

Figure 4 (a) LSV curves of the
20% iron-containing FeNx/NG using rotating
disk electrode at various rotation rates.
(b) Voltammograms recorded at fixed 1500 rpm for the FeNx/NG and Pt/CB composites on glassy carbon electrode
(GCE). (c) Reduction current densities (at 0 V (vs RHE) and 1500 rpm)
and (d) electron-transfer numbers were determined from LSV measurements.
Voltammograms were recorded in alkaline conditions (0.1 M KOH) applying
a scan rate of 10 mV s–1.

However, the reduction current density of our most promising
composite
(recorded at 0 V (vs RHE) at 1500 rpm rotation rate) was still lower
than that of the most commonly used Pt/CB catalyst (4.45 mA cm–2) (seen in Figure 4c). Furthermore, the onset potential was slightly more
positive in the case of Pt/CB-modified GCE (0.96 V (vs RHE)), but
considering the price difference between Pt/CB and FeNx/NG, our composites certainly represent a competitive
value proposition.

Further information about the ORR mechanism
was obtained via the
Koutecký–Levich analysis of the linear sweep voltammograms
recorded at different rotation rates (Figures 4a and S5 and S7b). Electron-transfer numbers were determined by using the Koutecký–Levich
equation 1  where j is the apparent current
density, jk and jd are the kinetic and diffusion-limited current densities,
respectively, n is the number of transferred electron
of one oxygen molecule, F is the Faraday constant, k is the rate constant, the cO2b and DO2 values are 1.2 × 10–6 mol cm–3 and 1.9 × 10–5 cm2 s–1, the oxygen concentration and
diffusion coefficient in 0.1 M KOH at 23 °C, respectively,53 ν is the solution’s kinetic viscosity
(8.9 × 10–3 cm2 s–1),54 and ω denotes the electrode’s
angular velocity in rad s–1.55

The Koutecký–Levich plots of the sample
series were
determined from LSV measurements on glassy carbon RDE electrodes and
are depicted in Figure 5 at different potentials. The fitted linear lines of the plots refer
to the first-order kinetics of the reaction (Koutecký–Levich
plots of the other samples are depicted in Figures S6 and S7c),56 while off-zero intercepts
indicate a mixed kinetic diffusion control.57Figure 4d summarizes
the corresponding electron-transfer numbers. The pristine iron nitride
and the nitrogen-doped graphene yielded 3.2, while higher values were
obtained in the case of composites. The onset potential for FeNx in the linear voltammograms can be seen at
more negative potentials; therefore, measurements were done only in
the lower potential regime. By changing the potential from 4.5 to
1.5 V (vs RHE), the electron-transfer number increased from 3.3 to
3.8 and from 3.5 to 4.0 for 5 and 10 wt % iron contents, respectively.
This indicates that increasing the overpotential favors the four-electron
process over the two-electron pathway. The four-electron pathway was
observed at higher overpotentials in the 10 wt % sample and in almost
the whole investigated potential range in the 20 wt % composite. This
result is comparable with the behavior of our as-prepared Pt/CB composite
and other commercially used platinum-based catalysts.58,59

Figure 5 Koutecký–Levich
plots determined from linear sweep
voltammetry. Composites with (a) 5%, (b) 10%, (c) 20%, and (d) 50%
iron contents were deposited onto a glassy carbon electrode.

To investigate the role of iron
nitride in the composites, the
iron nitride was removed from the surface of the nitrogen-doped graphene
by etching the 20 wt % iron-containing sample in a 4 M HCl solution. Figure S8a shows the TEM image of the composite
after etching (curve “20% Fe_e”). The successful removal
of the iron nitride particles was confirmed by XRD, as only the reflections
corresponding to nitrogen-doped graphene can be seen in the diffractogram
in Figure S8b. The ORR activity of the
etched sample was compared to that of the 20 wt % composite and the
pristine nitrogen-doped graphene in Figure S9. LSV curves of the modified GCE electrodes recorded at 1500 rpm
rotation rate (Figure S9a) show that although
the current density decreased slightly due to the etching process,
it was still higher than in the case of nitrogen-doped graphene prepared
in the absence of iron nitride. Furthermore, the onset potential showed
a negative shift from 0.9 to 0.85 V (vs RHE) after removing the iron
nitride particles. A similar trend was observed for the electron-transfer
number insofar as it decreased after the removal of the metal nitride
phase (3.6). However, the latter value is still higher than in the
case of nitrogen-doped graphene prepared in the absence of the metal
precursor (3.2) (Figure S9b). The deteriorating
performance, i.e., the drop in current density and electron-transfer
number and the shift in the onset potential, clearly exposes the importance
of iron nitride in the ORR activity of the composite. A stronger Fe–N–C
interaction between the metal nitride and the support was formed during
the synthesis, and this synergistic effect further improved the electrocatalytic
ORR activity.60

There is an ongoing
debate on the location and chemical nature
of the active sites in M–N–C ORR catalysts, and thus,
several theories allow in recent literature. It was suggested that
the iron species only participate in the active C/N site formation
during catalyst preparation, but they do not work as ORR active sites.9 According to other studies, including the present
work, the activity of the nonprecious metal-containing nitrogen-doped
carbon catalysts decreased after the removal of the metallic part
in an acidic treatment. This clearly underlines the importance of
the metal nitride in the electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen.9,61 The higher ORR activity of the etched sample compared to that of
the pristine nitrogen-doped graphene can be explained with the increased
amount of nitrogen in the graphene structure. Lai et al. showed that
the increased pyridinic nitrogen content in the carbon structure converts
the mechanism from the two-electron process to the four-electron pathway.62

A possible oxygen reduction reaction mechanism
with a four-electron
process is summarized in Figure 6. After the adsorption of an oxygen molecule onto the
surface of the nitride nanoparticle, the oxygen–oxygen bond
is weakened due to the strong interaction between the transition metal
and oxygen. The first electron-transfer step results in the formation
of an adsorbed O2– species. In the next
step, peroxide is formed on the surface in the reaction of adsorbed
O2– with a water molecule. In the third
reaction step, adsorbed OH is formed, which then desorbs as hydroxide
ion in the final step, closing the reaction cycle. It is worth mentioning
that this mechanism can take place on the nitrogen-doped graphene
surface as well. Since the incorporation of nitrogen atoms can substantially
modify the charge and spin distribution at the neighboring carbon
atoms, the latter become more prone to the interaction with oxygen
molecules. This in turn results in higher ORR activity, as it is well
known from the literature.63,64

Figure 6 Schematic of the possible
ORR mechanism in FeNx/NG composite via
the four-electron pathway.

Another reaction pathway could be the so-called outer-sphere
mechanism,
which is also possible in alkaline media. In this case, the solvated
oxygen molecules are in the outer Helmholtz plane, and a noncovalent
hydrogen bond is formed between the oxygen and the adsorbed OH, which
acts as an outer-sphere bridge in this case. However, this pathway
promotes the two-electron pathway.65

A further important technological aspect of ORR catalysts is their
resistance against impurities. In direct methanol fuel cells, methanol
is used as fuel, which diffuses through the polymeric membrane separating
the anode and cathode compartments. This so-called methanol crossover
reduces the ORR activity and therefore reduces the efficiency of the
whole fuel cell. The methanol resistance of our most active 20 wt
% iron-containing composite was tested in a chronoamperometric test.
In Figure 7, the relative
current (I/I0), i.e.,
the ratio of the current measured at a given time and the initial
current of the composite, is compared to that of commercial Pt/CB
catalyst-modified GCE electrode.

Figure 7 Alkaline (0.1 M KOH) chronoamperometric
methanol tolerance ORR
response at 0.51 V (vs RHE) of commercial Pt/CB catalyst and the 20
wt % Fe-containing composite deposited onto a glassy carbon electrode.

After the addition of methanol
to the electrolyte solution at 360
s, a sharp drop in the relative current was observed in the case of
the Pt/CB-modified electrode. The electrocatalytic activity decreased
steeply in the presence of methanol due to the activity of Pt/CB toward
the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR).66 On the other hand, there was no significant change in the relative
current of our non-noble-metal composite, thus evidencing considerably
higher methanol tolerance compared to the widely used precious-metal
Pt/CB catalyst.

Conclusions
A single-step synthesis
was developed to obtain iron nitride nanoparticle-decorated
nitrogen-doped graphene catalysts for the electrochemical oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR). The composites were synthesized via the high-temperature
annealing of a lyophilized mixture of graphene oxide and iron(III)
acetylacetonate under ammonia atmosphere. A mixture of FeN and Fe2N was formed during the thermal treatment, with an increasing
particle size from 23.4 to 127.0 nm by increasing the iron content
in the 5–50 wt % range. Increasing amounts of pyridinic- and
pyrrolic-type nitrogen moieties were successfully incorporated into
the graphene structure along with the increase in the iron content.
The electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst was tested in a three-electrode
system in alkaline media using the rotating disk electrode technique
at different rotation rates. The highest current density (3.65 mA
cm–2 at 1500 rpm) was reached in the 20 wt % iron-containing
composite, outperforming both the pristine iron nitride and the nitrogen-doped
graphene. The composite catalyzes the oxygen reduction via the four-electron
pathway, as evidenced from the determination of the electron-transfer
number. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited high methanol tolerance
compared to a commercial platinum-based system. The latter benefit
is particularly relevant for handling cathode-side methanol oxidation,
one of the major drawbacks of precious-metal ORR fuel cell catalysts
in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Additional advantages of the
suggested system include refraining from both the high price of platina
group metals and the limited availability of cobalt, a widely studied
metal in non-precious-metal ORR catalyst.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of Graphene Oxide
The modified Hummers method
was used in the graphene oxide synthesis.67 Typically, 4.5 g of graphite powder and sodium nitrate (NaNO3) were mixed with 210 mL of c.c. H2SO4 under vigorous stirring for 30 min. Then, 27 g of KMnO4 was added to the solution with continuous cooling in an ice bath.
After 24 h stirring, 500 mL of H2O and 10 mL of 50% H2O2 were poured into the solution and stirred for
another 2 h. The product was washed with deionized (DI) water to obtain
sulfate-free supernatant and then dried at 80 °C overnight.

Synthesis of Iron Nitride/Nitrogen-Doped Graphene Oxide
In a typical synthesis, graphene oxide and iron(III) acetylacetonate
were mixed in DI water. To obtain composites with 5, 10, 20, and 50
wt % iron loadings, 33.3, 70.2, 158.2, and 632.1 mg of iron salts
were weighed in, respectively. The mixture was stirred overnight,
followed by lyophilization with a Labconco freeze dryer at 0.014 mbar
and −55 °C. Ammonia (120 sccm) heat treatment at 600 °C
was then applied for 1 h, purging the furnace with ammonia to prevent
oxygen contamination in the product. Bare iron nitride and nitrogen-doped
graphene were also prepared for comparison. Pristine iron nitride
was prepared via annealing of iron(III) acetylacetonate powder, while
nitrogen-doped graphene was prepared according to the previous recipe
of the composites, but without adding the iron precursor. Untreated
graphene oxide was subjected to the same lyophilization and annealing
steps. To investigate the role of iron nitride in the catalytic activity,
the as-prepared composite with 20% iron content was annealed in a
round-bottom flask under continuous stirring in a 4 M HCl solution
for 48 h to remove the iron nitride from the graphene surface.

Characterization
Methods
Sample morphology was studied
by an FEI Tecnai G2 20 X Twin transmission electron microscope
(TEM) at a 200 kV accelerating voltage. Samples were drop-cast onto
a copper mounted holey carbon film from isopropyl alcohol suspension.
The diameter of 50–50 iron nitride particles was measured in
10 representative TEM images to determine the corresponding particle
size distribution. The powder X-ray diffractograms were recorded by
a Rigaku Miniflex II diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at
a scan speed of 4° min–1. Raman spectra were
measured using 532 nm laser excitation at 5 mW power (Thermo Scientific
DXR Raman Microscope), averaging 10 scans from 200 to 3500 cm–1 Raman shift at 1 cm–1 resolution.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was done using the Al anode’s
Kα radiation (SPECS instrument with a PHOIBOS 150 MCD 9 hemispherical
analyzer), where the analyzer was used in the fixed analyzer transmission
mode with a 20 eV pass energy and the X-ray gun at 210 W (14 kV, 15
mA).

Electrode Preparation
For all electrochemical measurements,
a 3 mm glassy carbon electrode (purchased from BASi) was used. The
carbon surface was thoroughly cleaned before any subsequent surface
modification. After carefully polishing it with a 0.05 μm diameter
alumina slurry, it was rinsed and sonicated in ethanol and ion-exchanged
water, followed by drying in air at room temperature. For the RDE
samples, a homogeneous suspension of 1.0 mg of sample in a mixture
of 250 μL of ethanol/water (1:1 volume ratio) and 10 μL
of 5 wt % Nafion solution was prepared via ultrasonication. A 15.0
μL aliquot from the resulted suspension was then drop-cast onto
the pretreated glassy carbon electrode and dried at room temperature.
The same method was used to prepare the 10 wt % Pt-containing Pt/CB-modified
CGE electrode, which served as an ORR benchmark catalyst.

Electrochemical
Measurements
The ORR activity of the
composites was investigated in a three-electrode configuration, where
the surface-modified glassy carbon electrode and a platinum wire served
as the working and counter electrodes, respectively. The working electrode
potential was determined against a Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl, BASi) reference
electrode. The potential was varied during cyclic and linear sweep
voltammetry (CV and LSV) measurements (ACM Instruments GILL AC electrochemical
workstation) from 0 to −1000 mV against Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl)
at a scan rate of 10 mV s–1. During the rotating
disk electrode (RDE) LSV measurements, the rotation rate was varied
between 500 and 3000 rpm. Background correction was done to all voltammograms,
and the resulted corrected data were used for further calculations.
All measurements were carried out in nitrogen- and oxygen-saturated
0.1 M KOH solutions at room temperature (23 °C).

Potentials
against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) were used throughout
the study and calculated according to the well-known equation 2  where E is the measured potential
against the reference electrode and EAg/AgCl (vs SHE) is its standard electrode potential (0.209 V) at 23 °C.
SHE denotes the standard hydrogen electrode.

Methanol tolerance
was investigated in a 0.1 M KOH solution with
continuous oxygen bubbling via chronoamperometry at 0.51 V (vs RHE).
After continuously recording the current for 6 min, 1 mL of 3 M methanol
solution was quickly added to the system and the corresponding change
was recorded.
