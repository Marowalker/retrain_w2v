Poly(acrylamide)-b-complex salts made from a symmetric
poly(acrylate-b-acrylamide) block copolymer, where
the acrylate charges are neutralized by cationic surfactant counterions,
form kinetically stable aqueous dispersions of hierarchical aggregates
with a liquid-crystalline complex salt core and a diffuse hydrated
shell. By the addition of suitable amounts of long-chain alcohols,
such as octanol or decanol, the structure of the internal phase can
be varied, producing micellar cubic, hexagonal, lamellar, or reverse
hexagonal liquid-crystalline phases. In addition, a disordered reverse
micellar phase forms at the highest content of octanol. These core
structures are the same as those previously obtained for macroscopic
homopolymer poly(acrylate) complex salt/water/n-alcohol
systems at the corresponding compositions. The poly(acrylamide)-b-complex salt dispersions are kinetically stable for several
weeks, with their colloidal properties and internal structures remaining
unchanged. The methodology described here establishes an easy and
robust protocol for the preparation of colloidal nanoparticles with
variable but controlled internal structures.

Introduction
Several studies of
water-dispersible core–shell nanoparticles
made from charged–neutral block copolymers and oppositely charged
surfactants have been reported in the last years.1−6 The most studied systems involve alkyltrimethylammonium cationic
surfactants and the block copolymer poly(acrylic acid-b-acrylamide) [P(AA-b-AAm)].1−3,5,6 When such complexes
are prepared by mixing individual aqueous solutions of the charged–neutral
block copolymer and the charged surfactant, the species associates
into colloidal complexes in the form of core–shell nanoparticles.
In addition, these solutions contain the original simple counterions
of the charged polymer and the surfactant. The core of the nanoparticle
contains densely packed surfactant micelles surrounded by polyion
blocks. The outer part of the colloidal complex is a corona composed
of neutral poly(acrylamide) blocks. Further studies revealed that
the micelles in the core of the particles, prepared as described,
were arranged in a disordered state, showing no long-range order.1,2,5,6

The use of stoichiometric polyion–surfactant ion “complex
salts” (CSs), free of other ions, was proposed a few years
ago as an alternative strategy to study the phase behavior of polymer/surfactant
complexes. The principal advantage of this strategy is that the number
of components is kept at a minimum, making it possible to study the
effects of adding a single component to the system or replacing one
by another, in isolation. This allowed the determination of truly
binary phase diagrams for CS mixtures with water7−9 and the assessment
of the effect of added n-alcohols or other organic
solvents on their ternary phase behavior.10−13 On the basis of this methodology,
our group has recently reported studies using poly(acrylamide)-b-CS block copolymers containing the hydrophilic block copolymer
poly(acrylate-b-acrylamide), neutralized by dodecyltrimethylammonium
counterions, to produce core–shell nanoparticles dispersed
in an aqueous medium.3 Notably, the dispersions
produced from the block copolymers containing stoichiometric CSs invariably
gave nanoparticle cores displaying a micellar cubic liquid-crystalline
structure, agreeing with that previously observed for maximally water-swollen
homopolymer dodecyltrimethylammonium–polyacrylate CS.8−10 Nanoparticles prepared by mixing individual aqueous solutions of
the anionic−neutral block copolymer and the cationic surfactant,
referred here as “conventionally prepared”, behave different
from that obtained by dispersing poly(acrylamide)-b-CS in water, as will be described in the present report.

Nanoparticles
with liquid-crystalline cores are known to be formed
by different chemical systems. Examples include the cubosomes,14 which are dispersions of bicontinuous cubic
phases studied for their potential for drug delivery. Other more recent
examples are from studies reported by Lindman and co-workers,15 and in the last few years, reports by Uchman16 have described internally structured particles
using the complexation between surfactants and polyions. During the
past years, a series of studies have reported the formation of colloidal
complexes made from oppositely charged surfactants and charged–neutral
block copolymers.1,2,4−6,17,18 These liquid-crystalline nanoparticles have also been studied aiming
at the control and change of their internal structures by specific
triggers such as enzymes19 and near infrared
light,20 to make them suitable for important
practical applications such as drug delivery. It has previously been
shown that, for example, differences in the liquid-crystalline structure
can change the drug diffusion and hence the release, with research
progressing toward the use of in situ changes to control the drug
release by these liquid-crystalline matrices.21

In this work, we have expanded our studies of dispersions
containing
stoichiometric CSs of the symmetric block copolymer P(AA42-b-AAm42) and dodecyl- or hexadecyltrimethylammonium
cationic surfactants (C12TA+ and C16TA+) with the aim to achieve additional internal structures
by adding long-chain alcohols. This strategy is based on the previous
experience of systems formed by the corresponding homopolymer CS,
water, and various n-alcohols.10−13 Small angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) has been used to identify and characterize the liquid-crystalline
interior of the aggregates. In addition, the average radius and the
zeta potential of the colloidal nanoparticles have been investigated.

Figure 1 shows the SAXS patterns obtained for dispersions of PAAm42-b-C12TAPA42 or PAAm42-b-C16TAPA42 in water.
The scattering peaks (Figure 1A) for the former system had a spacing ratio of 41/2:51/2:61/2, indicating a Pm3̅n cubic structure. For the PAAm42-b-C16TAPA42 dispersion (Figure 1B), the peak positions
at 1:31/2:2 reveal a hexagonal P6mm structure. The lattice parameter for the cubic structure
in PAAm42-b-C12TAPA42 is 8.40 nm, which is very similar to that previously obtained in
the dodecyltrimethylammonium–poly(acrylate) CS/water bulk cubic
phase.9,10 A similar close correspondence has been
recently observed between the cubic structures of the homopolymer
CS and the cubic cores of CS nanoparticles from asymmetric poly(acrylamide)-b-CS block copolymers.3 For the
hexagonal phase in the PAAm42-b-C16TAPA42 core, we now find a =
4.84 nm, also in very close agreement with the bulk phase formed in
the corresponding hexadecyltrimethylammonium–poly(acrylate)
CS/water system.9,10

n-Alcohol-Loaded Nanoparticles
Previous
studies have shown that long-chain n-alcohols added
to aqueous homopolymer CSs induce a series of phase changes as the
ratio of alcohol/CS increases in the mixed aggregates.10,12 To prepare nanoparticles with different internal liquid-crystalline
structures, different amounts of octanol and decanol were added to
the poly(acrylamide)-b-CS block copolymer dispersions,
exploiting the cosurfactant behavior of the n-alcohols. Table 1 summarizes the results
obtained at different n-alcohol/CS mass ratios (R), including R = 0. It is important to
note that the R values were calculated taking into
account only the CS block of the poly(acrylamide)-b-CSs. Now, the findings for each of the four combinations of CS and n-alcohol will be described in detail.

PAAm42-b-C12TAPA42 Nanoparticles
+ Octanol or Decanol
For increasing decanol contents in the aqueous dispersions of PAAm42-b-C12TAPA42, the
internal structure of the aggregates changed in the following sequence:
cubic, normal hexagonal, and lamellar. At a low decanol content (R = 0.256), the CS core displays a normal hexagonal phase
with Bragg peak positions of 1:31/2:2 in the SAXS patterns
(Figure 2A). When the
decanol fraction is increased further (R = 0.613),
SAXS peaks with a spacing ratio of 1:2:3 indicate the formation of
a lamellar structure (Figure 2B). The same sequence of structures, as with decanol, was
observed with added octanol (Figure 2C,D). SAXS patterns for additional decanol
and octanol concentrations in PAAm42-b-C12TAPA42 dispersions (see Table 1), indicating hexagonal and
lamellar structures, are presented in Figure S1. The repeat distances (d) between the bilayers
in the lamellar structures in the core of PAAm42-b-C12TAPA42 nanoparticles was 4.72
nm when using decanol and d = 4.68 nm for octanol.

1.0 wt % of poly(acrylamide)-b-CS, analyzed at 25
°C.

PAAm42-b-C16TAPA42 Nanoparticles + Octanol
or Decanol
Figure 3 shows the SAXS patterns obtained
for PAAm42-b-C16TAPA42 nanoparticles with different amounts of decanol. At a low decanol content (R = 0.142), the SAXS
pattern (Figure 3A)
from the complex showed scattering peaks with a spacing ratio of 1:31/2:41/2:71/2, indicating a structure
with hexagonal packing of cylindrical micelles, as for the alcohol-free
sample (Figure 1B).
However, some other peaks also appear. These peaks show a regular
spacing ratio of 1:2:3, indicating a Pm space group
for a lamellar structure being formed inside of the nanoparticles.
Therefore, this SAXS pattern could be attributed to a mixture of two
different structures of Pm lamellar and P6mm hexagonal. Further addition of decanol (R = 0.321) leads to the formation of a pure lamellar phase,
with d = 4.34 nm (Figure 3B). SAXS patterns for other decanol compositions
(see Table 1) indicating
a lamellar structure, with d = 4.34 nm, are presented
in Figure S2.

With increasing contents of octanol, the
CS core
of PAAm42-b-C16TAPA42 nanoparticles changed from normal to inverted structures. At low
octanol contents (R = 0.818), the SAXS pattern revealed
1:2 Bragg reflections, indicating a lamellar structure, with d = 4.31 nm (Figure 4A). As more octanol was added (R = 4.067),
the peak positions at 1:31/2:2 (Figure 4B) revealed that another hexagonal structure
was achieved. There are two possible 2D hexagonal structures. One
is the normal phase (also referred as HI phase), already
discussed above, in which the hydrophobic alkyl chains of the surfactants
are located inside of the cylinders with the hydrophilic polar headgroups
facing the surface of the cylinder, surrounded by a continuous water
domain containing the negatively charged poly(acrylate) chains. Another
is the reverse phase (HII phase), where the water phase
is located inside of the cylinders, with the hydrophobic surfactant
chains facing toward a continuous alcohol domain surrounding the cylinders.22

Figure 4 SAXS patterns for octanol-loaded PAAm42-b-C16TAPA42 displaying (A) lamellar
for R = 0.818, (B) reverse hexagonal for R =
4.067, and (C) reverse micellar core structures for R = 8.540. Samples containing 1.0 wt % of poly(acrylamide)-b-CS, analyzed at 25 °C.

From a symmetry point of view, both structures (normal and
reverse)
are 2D hexagonal and possess peak position ratios of 1:31/2:2. In Figure 4B,
the structure could be identified as reverse hexagonal, once the nanoparticles
are rich in octanol. Still further addition of octanol (R = 8.540) leads to the formation of a reverse micellar phase, referred
to as the L2 phase. This phase consists of an isotropic
and disordered solution of reverse micelles. A SAXS pattern for the
L2 phase, shown in Figure 4C, presents only a broad peak corresponding to the
micelle–micelle correlation distance of around 4.1 nm.

Reversibility
of n-Alcohol-Induced Structural
Transitions
To confirm the reversibility of the structural
transitions by the incorporation of n-alcohols to
the nanoparticle cores, an aqueous dispersion of 1.0 wt % PAAm42-b-C12TAPA42, prepared
by using decanol to promote the formation of a lamellar phase, was
dialyzed against deionized water for 3 days. The reference sample
containing no n-alcohol presented a cubic interior
(Figure 5A), as already
discussed above and the decanol-loaded nanoparticles at R = 0.613, a lamellar liquid-crystalline structure (Figure 5B). After 3 days of dialysis,
the latter sample presented a SAXS pattern (Figure 5C) that was virtually identical to that from
the initially n-alcohol-free reference sample (cubic Pm3̅n with the same lattice parameter),
confirming the full reversibility of this process.

with added decanol at R = 0.613; (C) return to cubic
structure after 3 days of dialysis of the latter sample against deionized
water. All measurements were performed at 25 °C.

Thermal Phase Behavior
It is well
known that lamellar
phases formed by lipid/surfactant liquid crystals present a characteristic
thermotropic phase behavior. They undergo the gel-to-liquid-crystalline
phase transition (Lβ–Lα)
upon increasing the temperature. Below the transition temperature, Tm, the surfactant alkyl chains are in a solidlike
state. Above Tm, the surfactant molecules
are in the fluid liquid-crystalline state, in which the conformational
disorder of alkyl chains predominates.23 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the
thermal phase behavior in lamellar PAAm42-b-C16TAPA42 nanoparticles. In a similar manner,
a lamellar sample prepared using the homopolymer CS C16TAPA30, prepared in the same way as in the earlier work,10 was also analyzed. Figure 6 compares the DSC thermograms obtained for
the two samples that possess the same decanol/CS mass ratio.

containing 1.0 wt % PAAm42-b-C16TAPA42 and 0.8 wt % decanol. R = 0.325
for both samples.

By integrating the peaks
in the thermograms, one can determine
the enthalpy change (ΔH) associated with the
phase transition. Table 2 shows the measured ΔH values of the gel-to-liquid
crystalline transition as well as the transition temperature (Tm) and peak width (ΔT1/2) obtained from the DSC measurements. Again, the thermotropic
data for the poly(acrylamide)-b-CS nanoparticles
clearly agree with those found for the corresponding homopolymer CS,
with the same n-alcohol content.

Colloidal Properties of
the Nanoparticles
To complete
the physicochemical characterization of the liquid-crystalline nanoparticles,
particles in freshly prepared dispersions were also characterized
by their hydrodynamic radii (RH) and zeta
potentials (ζ). Table 3 summarizes the results for nanoparticles featuring all of
the different internal structures. The average radius was around 120
nm for all nanoparticles. The polydispersity index (PDI) of the nanoparticles
was consistently 0.1.

Comparing the nanoparticles prepared using
pure PAAm42-b-C12TAPA42 or PAAm42-b-C16TAPA42 in water (no
added n-alcohol), the former displayed zeta potential
values that were slightly more negative (around −35 mV) than
the latter (around −25 mV). For all combinations of block copolymer
and alcohol, the absolute value of the nanoparticle zeta potential
decreased with an increase in n-alcohol content (Table 3).

Discussion
Nature
of the Colloidal Nanoparticles
A striking difference
between ours and the previously reported poly(acrylate-b-acrylamide)/cationic surfactant nanoparticle dispersions is the
occurrence or not of liquid-crystalline structures in the nanoparticle
cores. Nanoparticles conventionally prepared were reported as possessing
disordered cores.1,2,5,6 The strategy for preparing nanoparticles
containing CS cores reported in the present work was chosen to allow
a more accurate control of the phase behavior of the species and ensured
the formation of nanoparticles with a liquid-crystalline interior
and the evaluation of the effect of added n-alcohols
on the structured nanoparticle cores.

It is questionable whether
the small differences in composition (the presence or absence of low
concentrations of inorganic ions), resulting from the two methods
of preparation, could by itself be the cause of the difference in
the nanoparticle core structure. The particle size could be more important:
available data on particle size show that the nanoparticles prepared
by dispersing poly(acrylamide)-b-CS display larger
cores. By using our procedure, nanoparticles with an average radius
slightly larger than 100 nm are produced.

The size ratio core/lattice
parameter (n) of the
nanoparticles studied in this report was estimated by simply dividing
the average particle diameter by the lattice parameter for each phase,
as detailed in the Supporting Information. This ratio varied in the range 27 ± 5 for all internal structures
(see Table S1). For conventionally prepared
nanoparticles, the cores are much smaller and may be too small to
accommodate a number of units sufficient to form a crystalline structure
with long-range order. Taking into account the average size of conventionally
prepared nanoparticles (∼30 nm)1 and the lattice parameter of a cubic phase (8.4 nm), for example, n is around 3, which is around 10-fold lower than what is
described in this paper and most likely not enough to constitute a
liquid-crystalline domain. Similar arguments were used, for example,
by Guillot et al.,24 to explain the absence
of a liquid-crystalline order in hexosomes (dispersions of reverse
hexagonal lipid-based phases) below 30 nm (the lattice parameter being a = 5.82 nm).

Colloidal complexes similar to those
studied here are known to
display properties that depend on the sample preparation procedures.
Cationic lipid–polyelectrolyte (DOTAP/PAA) complexes were reported
as systems out of equilibrium.17 Polyelectrolyte
complex dispersions formed by oppositely charged polymers in aqueous
media were also described to vary in size, structure, and stability
depending on the mixing conditions.25 Tarahovsky
et al.26 described lipoplexes (DNA–lipid
complexes) with phase preferences depending on the sample preparation.
Nizri et al.27 reported the study [by means
of cryo-transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering
(DLS)] of liquid-crystalline nanoparticles formed by the direct mixing
of CxTAB (x = 10–16)
and sodium poly(acrylate) solutions, leading to different surfactant/polymer
molar charge ratios (Z). They described a wide range
of particle sizes depending on the Z values, the
surfactant alkyl chain length, and the way the experiments were conducted.
These findings are also valid in complex dispersions composed of positively
charged polymers and negatively charged surfactants.28,29 The commonly encountered history dependence suggests that the nanoparticles
studied in the present work are not equilibrium structures and that
their size is process-dependent, which is consistent with the properties
of colloidal dispersions. Nevertheless, we have established a method
to produce, in a reproducible fashion, nanoparticles with colloidal
properties that remain unchanged for several weeks. It is known that
the shape of the internally structured nanoparticles may display changes
depending on the core structure, giving rise to anisotropic geometries.30 However, such an investigation has not been
conducted thoroughly yet and discussions about the shape of the produced
nanoparticles are out of the scope of the present report.

Although
the CSs were prepared at a charge molar ratio (polymer/surfactant)
equal to 1, the produced nanoparticles possess a net negative charge,
as indicated by their zeta potential values. This indicates that there
is a dissociation of surfactant ions from the surface of the CS core
of the nanoparticles, producing an excess of anionic acrylate charges
at the core surface. The nanoparticles containing the dodecyltrimethylammonium
surfactant ion had a slightly more negative zeta potential than those
with the hexadecyltrimethylammonium surfactant. This can be related
to the difference in hydrophobicity and, hence, in aqueous solubility
of the two surfactant ions, as reflected in their different critical
micelle concentration (cmc) values,31 with
the dodecyltrimethylammonium surfactant ion displaying more dissociation
in the aqueous phase. The addition of n-alcohols
promoted a decrease in the zeta potential of the liquid-crystalline
nanoparticles. The incorporation of nonionic cosolutes into amphiphilic
aggregates may induce a charge dilution, yielding nanoparticles with
a lower surface charge. The higher the proportion of n-alcohol located in the surfactant aggregates, the higher the decrease
in the zeta potential value.

Colloidal nanoparticles have a
tendency to agglomerate as a result
of van der Waals attractive forces. Two modes of preventing the agglomeration
and stabilizing the nanoparticle dispersions kinetically are via electrostatic
and steric stabilization, and the resultant dispersion stability is
a balance between repulsive and attractive forces between the particles.
The electrostatic stabilization results from the repulsion between
the nanoparticles caused by the dissociated counterions in the electrostatic
double layer. The steric repulsion between nanoparticles surface-covered
with polymer chains may also contribute to the kinetic stabilization
of the nanoparticles.32 It is believed
that the poly(acrylamide) neutral chains composing the shell may contribute
to the stabilization of the colloidal nanoparticles, together with
the surface charge, through both steric and electrostatic stabilization
mechanisms. It has been observed that the colloidal dispersions are
kinetically stable with no sign of macroscopic phase separation for
several weeks. The observed variations in the zeta potential values
could have consequences for the long-term colloidal stability of the
nanoparticle dispersions; however, the latter topic is beyond the
scope of the present study.

Internal Structure of the Nanoparticles
Previously
reported ternary phase diagrams10,12 have shown that CS/n-alcohol mixtures, such as pure CSs, display a finite maximum
water uptake when equilibrated against excess water. With added decanol
or octanol, the maximum water uptake of the CS/n-alcohol
mixtures varied in the range 35–55 wt %, depending on the specific
choices of CSs and n-alcohol and their mixing ratio.
An obvious question is then whether the maximally water-swollen cores
of poly(acrylamide)-b-CS nanoparticles obey the same
phase diagrams, that is, if the same structure is obtained, at a given n-alcohol/surfactant ion ratio, in the nanoparticle core
as for the corresponding homopolymer CS/alcohol mixture. This direct
comparison was made and is presented in Figure 7 below.

Figure 7 Phase evolution as a function of n-alcohol content
for the systems: (A) C12TAPA30/water/decanol;
(B) C16TAPA30/water/decanol; (C) C16TAPA30/water/octanol; (D) C12TAPA30/water/octanol. Legend: C = cubic, H = hexagonal, L = lamellar, H2 = reverse hexagonal, and L2 = reverse micelles.
These phase diagrams, based on the data from refs (10) and (12), refer to maximally water-swollen
CS samples with an overall CS/water mass ratio of 0.45. The inserted
points show structures for the corresponding poly(acrylamide)-b-CS/n-alcohol systems, using the same
color codes as in the reference phase diagrams, obtained in the present
study. The core compositions shown are based on the true n-alcohol contents (see text).

Because of a non-negligible fraction of the alcohol residing
in
the water phase of the very dilute dispersions of poly(acrylamide)-b-CS studied here, previously reported31 partition coefficients of the n-alcohols
between dodecyl- and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide micelles and
water were used to calculate the true mole fractions of alcohol, Xa, of the mixed surfactant aggregates in the
cores, based on overall sample compositions. The points in Figure 7 indicate the thus
calculated compositions and the determined structures of the cores
of the copolymer nanoparticles. As a background in Figure 7, reference phase boundaries
shown have been calculated from data for maximally swollen CxTAPA30/n-alcohol mixtures,
taken from refs (10) and (12). Clearly,
there is an exact correspondence, within the resolution of the two
studies, between the two types of maximally swollen CS/n-alcohol mixtures. Because the C12TAPA30/octanol
system was not included in the previous studies, the reference phase
diagram for these mixtures is lacking in Figure 7D.

As shown above, it was possible
to reproduce the structures found
in homopolymer CS/water/n-alcohol ternary mixtures
in the cores of the corresponding poly(acrylamide)-b-CS nanoparticles dispersed in an aqueous medium. In addition, the
lattice parameters were also very similar, based on the data of refs (10) and (12). The close correspondence
found is not self-evident because one would expect some influence
of the poly(acrylamide) chains of the block copolymer on the surfactant
aggregate arrangement. A comparison of the effective radii of the
nanoparticles, approximately 100 nm, with the 11 nm length of a fully
stretched block of 42 acrylamide units implies that a fraction of
the poly(acrylamide) blocks must necessarily reside among the surfactant
aggregates in the cores. However, apparently, they affect neither
the mesophase structure nor the aggregate-to-aggregate distance represented
by the lattice parameters, for any of the structures investigated.

Moreover, it was a priori expected that the core–shell interface
and the consequent confinement of these structures could impose restrictions
on the lattice parameters of 2D or 3D internal structures, but such
effects were not seen. Confinement effects on the arrangement of the
liquid-crystalline structures in the inner part have previously been
reported. Golan and Talmon17 described
lamellar structures in the form of onion-like aggregates formed in
complexes between cationic lipids and oppositely charged polyions.
The same arrangement of bilayered structures was found in colloidal
complexes formed by the electrostatic association between ionic lipids
and an oligonucleotide.33 Cubosomes34 and hexosomes35 with
distorted structures were also reported elsewhere.

In some samples,
two different internal structures were found to
coexist in the liquid-crystalline nanoparticle dispersions. The systems
must then feature either particles with two phases coresiding in the
same core or a mixture of two kinds of particles featuring single-phase
cores of two very different structures that also differ substantially
in composition. The average n-alcohol mole fractions
in the particle cores are in the same range as for the corresponding
bulk systems belonging to a three-phase region (hexagonal, lamellar,
and excess isotropic solution). Hence, again, the structural data
agree with those for the homopolymer CSs. From the corresponding homopolymer
CS phase diagrams (see Figure 7), it can be inferred that there is a large difference in
the alcohol content between the two coexisting phases in the hexagonal/lamellar
two-phase area, for example. Guillot et al.24 have also reported oil-loaded liquid-crystalline nanoparticles,
in which the SAXS data indicated phase coexistence, depending on the
oil content. In their interpretation, the possibility to have a mixture
of nanoparticles having different internal liquid-crystalline structures
was rejected because the oil would be transferred from oil-rich nanoparticles
to the oil-poor ones. On similar grounds, we favor the interpretation
that mixed-phase dispersions of the systems studied here contain nanoparticles
with the two phases coresiding in the same core. However, the present
results do not allow us to distinguish these two cases.

The n-alcohols, when incorporated in surfactant
aggregates, can give two different effects commonly known as cosurfactant
and cosolvent effects, leading to changes in the structure of the
aggregate.10,12 Decanol acts as a cosurfactant,
being incorporated with the surfactant ions in the mixed aggregates,
where the hydroxyl groups are located at the interface.36 This effect results in an increase in the critical
packing parameter, favoring the formation of structures with low and
even inverted curvatures.12 Reverse structures,
such as the reverse hexagonal and micellar phases, are seen to form
only for octanol and at high octanol mole fractions. From this, one
can conclude that octanol functions as a cosolvent better than decanol
forming an octanol-continuous domain that can dissolve the reverse
CS aggregates, leading to the formation of an isotropic L2 phase at the highest octanol contents. This is in accordance with
previous findings, for homopolymer CSs, that the efficiency as a cosolvent
increases for shorter alcohols.10,12,13 The estimated solubility of the homopolymer CS C16TAPA30 is 10 and 40% in decanol and octanol, respectively.10

In contrast to the nanoparticles containing
normal ordered phases,
there are few reports on liquid-crystalline nanoparticles with reverse
structures; the latter reports concern essentially lipid–water
dispersions.37−39 In the present study, two different reverse phases
were found: a disordered micellar and a hexagonal phase. The reverse
hexagonal phase is composed of cylindrical micelles, in which the
polymer/aqueous phase is located inside of the cylinders with the
surfactant alkyl chains facing the outside of the oil phase. Bernardes
et al.13 studied reverse micelles in bulk
systems formed by poly(acrylate)–hexadecyltrimethylammonium
CSs, water, and different alcohols (octanol, hexanol, and butanol).
Their results indicated the formation of alcohol-soluble aggregates,
where each aggregate had a core of one polyion chain in water, surrounded
by neutralizing surfactant ions. Such an aggregate was described as
a reverse micelle with a spine.

A few findings of nanoparticles
with reverse internal structures
have been reported in the literature, such as the aqueous tetradecane-loaded
monolinolein particles, which can display cubic, hexagonal, discontinuous
cubic, and micellar reverse structures, depending on the oil content.38 Nakano et al.37 and
Tran et al.39 have also reported reverse
particles occurring in monoolein-based aqueous dispersions, when a
fatty acid (oleic or decanoic) is added to the system. More recently,
citrem (citric acid ester of glycerides) nanoparticles dispersed in
an aqueous medium were also shown to comprise the internal reverse
micellar (L2) structure when mixed with lipids.40 However, our study is the first report on nonlipid nanoparticles displaying reverse liquid-crystalline
structures at room temperature.

Depending on the n-alcohol fraction incorporated
into the core, the nanoparticles may display a lamellar interior structure.
Bilayers in the gel phase are highly ordered and packed structures.23 In some cases, the cooling of confined bilayers
below the Tm does not result in gel phase
formation, which is attributed to the presence of an effective area
constraint. It was also shown that the curvature of the bilayers affects
its properties compared to the planar lamellar state. For vesicles
of both lipids and surfactants, the transition temperature is found
to decrease gradually with decreasing vesicle size for aggregates
smaller than ±70 nm in diameter.41,42 In the limit
of high curvature, for very small vesicles, the formation of gel domains
is strongly suppressed, which is directly related to the increase
in the bending modulus of gel bilayers with respect to bilayers in
the fluid state.43

In view of these
previous findings, the quantitative agreement
between dispersed poly(acrylamide)-b-CSs and nondispersed
homopolymer CSs regarding both Tm and
ΔH for the thermally induced Lβ–Lα phase transition is quite remarkable.
It indicates that, apparently, there is no significant curvature or
confinement effect on the lamellar structures composing the core of n-alcohol-loaded dispersed nanoparticles. This result thus
follows the general pattern found here and in one previous3 study that the dispersed poly(acrylamide)-b-CS systems reproduce the phase behavior of bulk homopolymer
CSs.

By dialysis, it was possible to achieve the initial liquid-crystalline
structure of the nanoparticles by removing the n-alcohol
incorporated in the core of the nanoparticles. This highlights the
possibility to switch the internal structure of the poly(acrylamide)-b-CS nanoparticles from water-continuous to oil-continuous,
or vice versa, by simply adding or removing the alcohol.

Conclusions
and Outlook
In this work, we were able to reproduce the liquid-crystalline
phases of the bulk systems in the cores of poly(acrylamide)-b-CS nanoparticles. The various phases were achieved by
the incorporation of n-alcohols in the ordered cores,
acting as cosurfactants, inducing variation in the packing parameter
of the surfactant aggregates, and for n-octanol,
as a cosolvent in reverse structures. The SAXS data revealed the following
liquid-crystalline phases, depending on the nature and concentration
of n-alcohol: cubic, hexagonal, lamellar, reverse
hexagonal, and reverse micellar phase. Apparently, the confinement
of the phases into nanometric cores does not change their structural
properties. DLS measurements revealed nanoparticles with ∼100
nm average radius. These dispersions are kinetically stable, most
likely due to steric and electrostatic repulsion arising from PAAm
surface chains and negative zeta potentials, respectively. The colloidal
and structural properties of the dispersions are dependent on the
mixing pathways, but by using our procedure to prepare poly(acrylamide)-b-CS nanoparticles, we were able to obtain liquid-crystalline
core nanoparticles with reproducible colloidal and structural features.

In summary, the investigated poly(acrylamide)-b-CS dispersed systems present a rich structural variety in the cores
of the nanoparticles, which can be controlled in a systematic way
by the addition or removal of n-alcohols. This is
interesting as a versatile system for the purposes of delivering active
agents and stimuli-responsive systems, for example. The present study
also contributes to a better understanding of the nature of polyion/oppositely
charged surfactant interactions and the mapping of ordered liquid-crystalline
structures confined in colloidal domains. Over the years, lipid-based
liquid-crystalline nanoparticles have become the subject of many scientific
studies pointing out their applications as drug-delivery systems,
surface coatings, and environmentally responsive colloids and their
use as versatile model particles for soft matter studies, for example.
We present here a chemically different way to produce these internally
structured nanoparticles, with the advantage of possessing a potential
switchable mechanism that allows a precise control of the internal
phase. The knowledge of liquid-crystalline structures is fundamental
in the design of colloidal materials with desired properties and functions,
as evidenced by the huge research effort on various applications of
polymer/surfactant dispersions. Thus, the information reported in
the present study is encouraging for future work involving cryo-TEM,
aiming at the determination of the aggregates shape and arrangement
of the confined liquid-crystalline structures and to elucidate the
possible phase coexistence in the nanoparticle core and how the coexisting
phases are arranged.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
The
acid form of the symmetric block copolymer
P(AA42-b-AAm42) was synthesized
using controlled radical polymerization as described in a previous
work of our group.3 Dodecyltrimethylammonium
bromide and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, (C12TABr
and C16TABr, respectively) of 99% purity were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). The alcohols used were n-octanol (Sigma, USA) and n-decanol (Fluka, USA);
both were of the highest purity available (99%) and used as received.
Deionized water with a resistivity above 18.2 MΩ·cm–1 as obtained by a Milli-Q system was used in all experiments.

Preparation of Poly(acrylamide)-b-CS Block
Copolymers
All poly(acrylamide)-b-CS block
copolymers were prepared by titrating the hydroxide form of the surfactants
(C12TA+ and C16TA+) obtained
by an ion-exchange step, with aqueous solutions of the acid P(AA42-b-AAm42) until the equivalence
point, following the general procedure described earlier for CSs prepared
in our laboratories.6,8,9,12 The equivalence point at pH 8.6–8.9
was found to be the same as that determined using the homopolymers.6−9 The mixture was left overnight at 4 °C and its pH was adjusted
to the equivalence point when necessary, with P(AA42-b-AAm42) solution. The poly(acrylamide)-b-CS block copolymers were freeze-dried to obtain their
powders, which were kept in a desiccator. The final products were
named PAAm42-b-C12TAPA42 and PAAm42-b-C16TAPA42 according to the alkyl chain length of the surfactants used
in their preparation.

Sample Preparation
The dispersions
were prepared by
vortexing the appropriate amounts of CSs and water for approximately
1 min to achieve the final poly(acrylamide)-b-CS
concentration of 1.0 wt %. The samples containing n-alcohols were prepared in the same way, with the addition of desired
amounts of octanol or decanol to the solids before adding water and
vortexing.

Techniques
SAXS
SAXS measurements
were taken to identify the liquid-crystalline
structures formed in the nanoparticle cores. The measurements were
taken at the SAXS1 beamline of the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory,
LNLS, in Campinas, Brazil. The samples were positioned in a cell with
two flat mica windows, and a thermal bath connected to the sample
holder was used for temperature control. The X-ray wavelength was
1.608 Å, and the sample-to-detector distance was around 0.6 m,
as calibrated using silver behenate. The obtained charge-coupled device
(CCD) images were integrated and treated with Fit2D software44 to obtain the scattering function I(q), where q = (4π/λ)
sin(θ/2), with λ being the wavelength and θ being
the scattering angle. The relative diffraction peak positions were
used to identify the mesophase structures of the liquid-crystalline
nanoparticles. The interplanar distance (d) between
two reflecting planes is given by d = 2π/q, which enables us to calculate the corresponding mean
lattice parameter (a). The scattering pattern of
the so-called L2 (micellar reverse) phase shows only one
broad correlation peak, corresponding to the micelle–micelle
correlation distance. All measurements were recorded at 25 °C.

DSC
DSC measurements of the poly(acrylamide)-b-CS block copolymer dispersions were taken using a Microcal
VP high sensitivity differential scanning calorimeter (Microcal Inc.
Northampton, MA, USA) equipped with 0.542 mL twin total-fill cells.
Scanning was performed at a heating rate of 60 °C h–1 from 10 to 80 °C. For the concentrated homopolymer CS samples,
the DSC measurements were taken using a Q1000 differential scanning
calorimeter, TA Instruments. Around 5 mg of sample was hermetically
sealed into an aluminum pan. Measurements were taken at a heating
rate of 90 °C·h–1 from 10 to 80 °C.
In all cases, the analyses were made with null prescan, producing
fully reproducible results when comparing consecutive runs. Transition
enthalpies were obtained by integrating the area under the thermograms
along the temperature range. The calorimetric analyses were made in
triplicate.

DLS
The dispersions were evaluated
using DLS at 25
°C, using a Malvern Nano Zetasizer instrument with a 632.8 nm
laser and a detector positioned at 173°. From the apparent diffusion
coefficients, the hydrodynamic radii (RH) of the nanoparticles were determined using the Stokes–Einstein
relationship for translational diffusion. The zeta potential (ζ)
was estimated based on the electrophoretic mobility measurements using
the Smoluchowski model.
