In this article, we have judiciously
interfaced copper oxides with
graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) from thermal
reaction of melamine and copper sulfate in a one-pot protocol and
manipulated the perforated sheet morphology thereafter. The CCN-X (X = 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70, depending
on the wt % of CuSO4·5H2O) nanocomposites
were prepared by homogenously mixing different percentages of CuSO4·5H2O with melamine from a solid-state thermal
reaction in a furnace in air. Drastic lowering of CuSO4 decomposition temperature due to Cu(II)–amine complex formation
and subsequent reduction of Cu(II) species by in situ produced ammonia
(NH3) resulted in the production of CuO and catalytic amount
of Cu2O, homogeneously dispersed within the perforated
g-C3N4 nanosheet. How perforated sheet morphology
evolved by combined effect of NH3, released from thermal
condensation of melamine ensuring two-dimensional (2D) growth, and
sulfur trioxide (SO3), expelled from CuSO4·5H2O facilitating the perforation, yielding better catalytic
performance, has been elucidated. Excess NH3 from added
NH4Cl removed perforation and ensued a marked decrease
in efficacy. However, a high proportion of CuSO4·5H2O ruptured the framework of 2D sheets because of excess SO3 evolution. Among the different nanocomposites synthesized,
CCN-40 (CuO–Cu2O/g-C3N4) showed
the highest catalytic activity for 4-nitrophenol reduction. Thus,
enhanced efficiency of the copper oxide catalyst by interfacing it
with an otherwise inactive g-C3N4 platform was
achieved.

Introduction
In the era of nanoscience
and technology, a momentous leap in the
field of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles has been witnessed. Solid
oxides are most abundant in earth’s crust, and they are very
stable and rugged and would be the future materials if they are tuned
properly. The wide range of properties of nanoparticles has attracted
the attention of scientists over the decade, and different nanocomposites
are being designed to accomplish practical applications.1 Nanoparticles are popular photocatalysts because
of their high optical absorption capacity in the UV–visible
region, which consists of a major part of the solar spectrum. Metal
oxide nanoparticles are able to harvest solar energy efficiently,
and owing to their antiferromagnetic properties, low cost, nontoxicity,
and high stability, their wide range of applications as a gas sensor,
high-temperature superconductor, lithium battery, optical switch,
solar cell, electron field emitters, and other electronic and optical
devices are possible. In the biochemical field, metal and metal oxide
nanoparticles are used as sensors in cancer therapy, light emitting
devices, in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy studies, and also
for antimicrobial activity.2−5 Nanocomposites have been synthesized in a multitude
of ways such as thermal reactions, electrochemical methods, and photochemical
and sonochemical methods.1,2,6,7 Cu2O, the most studied
and oldest semiconducting naturally occurring material, has a wide
range of applications in solar H2 generation, catalytic
activity, batteries, and degradation of dyes, whereas CuO with high
electron-accepting property has found its application in photoelectrodes,
electronics, optoelectronics, and other fields of nanotechnology.8,9 CuO and Cu2O both are p-type transition metal semiconductors
with narrow 1.2 and 2.2 eV band gap values and 3d9 and
3d10 electronic configurations, respectively.10

In contemporary research, graphitic carbon
nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted the attention
of scientists because
of its similarity with graphene. It has a surfeit of applications
in energy conversion, gas storage, solar cells, and gas sensors.11−13 A general synthetic route of g-C3N4 preparation
is polycondensation of common monomers.11,14−16 It has intriguing features like commendable thermal stability and
high in-plane nitrogen content.11,16−20 The introduction of heteroatoms can alter the composition and properties
of carbon nitride, thereby engineering the molecular orbital shape
and position relevant for enhancing its ability to react and its selectivity.17 This in turn helps in the synthesis of composites
that are bestowed with a high electron density system within the catalyst
by either charge transfer complexation or connection with semiconductor
materials.21−23 Owing to the polymeric nature and weak van der Waals
force between adjacent layers, large interlayer spacings similar to
those in graphite are present, assisting in intercalation with superior
physicochemical properties.24−26 Apart from this, it has a delocalized
π-conjugated system and contains lots of coordination sites
called “nitrogen pots”, where the six nitrogen lone-pair
electrons interact with the metal ions, locking them in the plane
of the highly ordered tris-triazine (C6N7) units
linked via planar tertiary amino groups.24−26 The g-C3N4 layers have a band gap of 2.7 eV, and g-C3N4 is persistently used as a photocatalyst. It
has useful applications in degradation of toxic dyes, water splitting,
gas storage, antibacterial activity, Friedel craft reactions, NO decomposition,
and CO2 reduction.27−32

Environmental remediation is of utmost concern for the sustenance
of healthy life on earth. Nitrophenols and their derivatives are obstinate
toxic compounds incorporated in wastewater from various sources such
as herbicide, pesticide, insecticide, and synthetic dye industries.
The reduction strategy of 4-nitrophenol was first proposed by our
group,32 along with the plausible mechanism
and reaction kinetics,33 which was later
detailed by Ballauff et al.34−36 4-Nitrophenol reduction majorly
follows the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model, which reveals an induction
time caused by dynamic restructuring of the nanoparticle surface.37 Although 4-nitrophenol is a lethal material,
its reduced form is a potent intermediate for the synthesis of various
analgesic and antipyretic drugs. Apart from this, it is widely used
in photographic developers, anticorrosion lubricants, and hair dyeing
agents.38,39

Different multistep synthetic procedures
have been accounted for
among the few reports of the copper oxide/g-C3N4 nanocatalyst. Liu et al. synthesized Cu2O/g-C3N4 by a solvothermal method following the reduction of
CuCl2·2H2O by vitamin C and then reacting
with g-C3N4.40 Mitra
et al. also prepared a similar composite from g-C3N4 and reduction of Cu(OAc)2·H2O
using NaBH4.41 Li et al. prepared
CuO/g-C3N4 by the wet impregnation–calcination
technique by individually preparing g-C3N4 and
Cu2O. In this method, Cu2O was prepared from
CuSO4·5H2O, glucose, and NaOH, whereas
g-C3N4 was prepared from a reported method.42 Zhang et al. prepared Cu-Cu2O/g-C3N4 using the precursors g-C3N4, Cu(NO3)2, and NaBH4.43 We endeavored to embed both CuO and Cu2O onto g-C3N4 to design an ace catalyst for
superior application by following a one-pot facile green synthetic
route using a single copper precursor and melamine under heat treatment
in a furnace in air, for the first time. Here, we have capitalized
thermal condensation–polymerization of melamine for two-dimensional
(2D) nanosheet formation with obvious interaction of the Cu(II) moiety
with ammonia44 (NH3) at a substantially
low temperature and perforation of the 2D nanosheet morphology by
the in situ produced sulfur trioxide (SO3) from CuSO4·5H2O decomposition. Reduction of Cu(II) to
Cu(I) by NH345 and drastic lowering
of the decomposition temperature of CuSO4·5H2O in the presence of melamine, leading to the final CuO–Cu2O/g-C3N4 (CCN-X) nanocomposite,
are also notable deviations at a temperature of 550 °C. Inspired
by the abovementioned properties of the individual copper oxides and
g-C3N4, investigation of the catalytic efficiency
of as-prepared CCN-X nanocomposites for the 4-nitrophenol
reduction reaction was studied in detail.

Analytical
Instruments
Details have been provided in
the Supporting Information.

Considering
the best catalytic performance, characterizations were carried out
in detail with CCN-40 as the representative catalyst.

X-ray Diffraction
(XRD) Analysis
The XRD pattern (Figure 1) of the as-obtained
composite depicts peaks at 2θ = 32.6, 35.8, 38.9, 49.2, 53.8,
58.6, 61.7, 66.3, 68.2, 72.6, and 75.4°, which can be indexed
to the (110), (002)/(1̅11), (200)/(111), (202̅), (020),
(202), (311̅), (113̅), (220), (311), and (222̅)
lattice planes of CuO, respectively, as confirmed from JCPDS no. 48-1548.
No sharp peak was observed, instead a broad hump was observable below
30 because of g-C3N4 layers. The intensity in
this region was low, presumably, because of the excess of copper oxide
incorporated in g-C3N4 and also the high intensity
of CuO masking the less intense signals of g-C3N4. Pure g-C3N4 however shows peaks at 13.0 and
27.4°, which refer to the (100) and (002) planes of hexagonal
g-C3N4, as confirmed by JCPDS no. 44-0706. Time-dependent
XRD spectra (Figure S1a) reveal the gradual
synthesis of CuO–Cu2O and g-C3N4. However, the final product has greater percentage of CuO than that
of Cu2O; as a result, the XRD pattern of Cu2O is faint but evident in the final product. The XRD patterns of
bulk CuO heated in the presence of melamine (Figure S1b) and CCN-40 in the presence of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) (Figure S1c) were obtained.
The XRD peak of the used catalyst (Figure 12) clearly shows the peak of Cu, which explains
the gradual loss of catalyst activity.

nanocomposite CCN-40.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis
The
surface composition and oxidation state of the metal oxides were ascertained
by XPS analysis. The XPS spectra of the CuO−Cu2O/g-C3N4 composite show the presence of carbon, nitrogen, copper, and oxygen (Figure S2a). From the graph (Figure 2a), it is evident that the
peaks of C 1s located at 284.4, 286.2, and 288.4 eV were for sp2 C=C (graphitic or amorphous carbon formed due to decomposition
of carbon nitride due to X-ray irradiation or carbon-containing contaminants),
C–NH2, and N=C–N2. The
N 1s peak, which was comparatively more complicated, had three asymmetrical
peaks at 398.8, 399.6, and 401.1 eV, which can be assigned to C=N–C,
N–(C)3 groups linking structural motif (C6N7), or (C)2–NH connected with structural
defects or incomplete condensation, C–NH or C–NH2 or N–(C)3 inside the aromatic ring, respectively,
in triazine units as observed (Figure 2b).12,13,29 The N–(C)3 group consolidates polymerization and
the N–(C)3/C–NH peak ratio is a manifestation
of the degree of condensation reaction.13 The peaks at 952.2 and 932.3 eV can be assigned to the binding energy
of Cu1+ for Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2. The peaks at 933.8 and 953.4 eV and the shakeup satellite peaks
at higher binding energies of 942.3 and 961.8 eV can be assigned to
Cu2+ present in the CuO–Cu2O/gC3N4 nanocomposite (Figure 2d).10 XPS spectra (Figure 2c) show the main
peak of O 1s which on deconvolution gave a peak at 532.8 eV due to
lattice oxygen atoms in CuO–Cu2O and the other peak
at 535.8 eV for the adsorbed water molecules on the surface. The Cu
2p spectra (Figure S2b) of CCN-40 at 4
h clearly reveal the presence of Cu(II) and Cu(I) during the formation
of CCN-40.

CCN-40 nanocomposite.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Analysis
From graph
(Figure 3), the characteristic
stretching vibrational modes of s-triazine derivatives like C–N
heterocycles are observable from 900 to 1700 cm–1, thereby consolidating that nitrogen is chemically bonded to carbon
in the g-C3N4 moiety. On comparing the peaks
between pure g-C3N4 and as-synthesized CCN-40,
we observe a slight decrease in wavenumber for the latter, thus advocating
presumably the presence of a nitrogen–copper interface in the
composite (Figure S3). The sharp peak at
804 cm–1 is the contribution of the breathing mode
of the triazine unit. We observe broad low-intensity peaks at a higher
wavenumber at around 3200–3500 cm–1, which
can be assigned to the stretching vibration of N–H (primary
−NH2 and secondary =N–H), suggesting
the hydrogenation of some nitrogen atoms in g-C3N4.4−6 These peaks also suggest a bridging amine. Moreover, an absorption
peak observable at 2175 cm–1 can be attributed to
the cyano terminal group (C≡N) and cumulated double bond (−N=C=N–
and such similar bonds).20 The peaks at
601, 512, and 432 cm–1 are assigned to the Au mode
and 2Bu modes, respectively. The Cu(II)–O stretching along
the [1̅01] direction is likely to induce a peak at 601 cm–1, whereas stretching along the [101] direction shows
the peak at 512 cm–1.46,47 Faint peaks
in the range from 600 to 660 cm–1 in the IR active
mode prove the existence of a small amount of another phase, i.e.,
Cu2O, for the Cu(I)–O vibrational band.48

Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM), and High-Resolution Transmission Electron
Microscopy (HRTEM) Analyses
Field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) assisted in the determination
of the morphology of the nanocomposite. The FESEM and TEM images shows
bare sheet-like morphology of amorphous g-C3N4 (Figure 4a). FESEM
and TEM images of CCN-X divulges structural feature (Figure 4b and Figure S4a,b,c) of perforated sheet-like structure decorated with
particle deposited on it. From HRTEM analysis the fringe spacing of
copper oxides was obtained in the nanocomposite which was further
confirmed with SAED pattern. Curled nanosheets were observed from
representative TEM images of gC3N4. The composite
however has CuO–Cu2O nanoparticles of 10–20
nm size trapped on the g-C3N4 sheets, as displayed
in the TEM images. The figures obtained were from samples subjected
to ultrasonication, used to disperse the material prior to characterization,
which clearly establish the strong binding of the composite and stability
of the 2D nanosheets. The fringe patterns and selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern for CCN-30, CCN-40, CCN-50, and CCN-60
give d-spacings of 2.3 nm related to the (200/111)
plane of CuO or the (111) plane of Cu2O and 1.8 nm for
(202̅) of CuO. The used catalyst CCN-40 was also analyzed (Figure 4c) to obtain heavily
deposited Cu, confirmed by the fringe pattern for both copper oxide
and Cu. We also observe (Figure 5) the gradual synthesis of perforated CCN-40 at intervals
of 1 h. We realize that initially a 2D sheetlike morphology is dominant,
which at a time of 4 h gradually shows perforations probably due to
the expulsion of SO3 during decomposition of the CuSO4·5H2O molecule but at a much lower temperature
(∼550°C) than usual. With time, the gaps become more prominent,
resulting into perforated 2D nanosheets in the final product at the
end of 6 h. It is worth mentioning that the FESEM images of CCN-40
using 250, 500, and 1000 mg of NH4Cl during synthesis were
recorded, showing a gradual decrease in the perforation with an increase
in NH4Cl content at the start of the synthesis. This observation
guaranteed the role of NH3 not only for the extended graphitic
sheet formation out of condensation and subsequent polymerization
reaction but also for the prevention of the formation of perforated
morphology. To study the effect of excess CuSO4·5H2O on the morphology of the CCN-X, nanocomposite
CCN-90 was also prepared and the FESEM image was recorded (Figure S5). We see a rupture of the nanosheet
structure and formation of aggregated nanoplates. This presumably
happens because the excess SO3 causes a large number of
perforations in the nanosheets which eventually results in the ruptured
framework of the 2D sheet. Thus, the optimum amount of the precursor
compounds balances the evolution of NH3 and SO3 from the proposed one-pot reaction. Precisely, NH3 is
evolved first and then SO3, which assists in nanosheet
formation49 and its subsequent perforation
in a later step. Drastic lowering of CuSO4·5H2O decomposition temperature with melamine may be explained
by Cu(II)–amine complex formation50 and its reduction by the in situ produced NH3 under heating.
How excess NH3 blocks the creation of perforated nanosheet
morphology is verified experimentally as mentioned above (Figure S6).

area mapping showing the distribution of elements.

EDX Analysis
The evenly distributed
elements in CCN-X were recorded in energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy
analysis. The elemental area mapping (Figure 6) of the elements revealed the presence of
C, N, Cu, and O well distributed throughout the material.

analysis (TGA)-differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) analysis of a uniform mixture of CuSO4·5H2O and melamine.

Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) Analysis
The
FESEM and TEM images clearly display the perforations in the
as-prepared nanocatalyst, thereby promising a high surface area for
reaction. From the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm,
the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the
CCN-40 nanocatalyst was established to be 37.0485 m2 g–1 (Figure S7a). The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
measurement was implemented to obtain pore diameter of 138.392 Å
(Figure S7b).

TGA Analysis
The
thermogram depicts the change in sample
mass as a function of temperature and delivers stoichiometric, heat
stability, and compositional information for a complete reaction considering
the precursors as well as the intermediates. We have taken samples
of CuSO4·5H2O, mixture of the precursors
(optimum proportions), and CCN-40 product for thermal study. The samples
were heated at changing temperature in an oxygen atmosphere, and the
mass readings were recorded by a thermobalance at intervals. From
the thermogram (Figure S8a) of CuSO4·5H2O, we perceived that five molecules of
water of hydration leave in three distinct steps at three temperatures
within 250 °C. CuSO4 thus formed remains stable till
550 °C, and after which, CuSO4 releases SO3 and forms CuO within ∼700 °C. The reported thermogram
of melamine51 shows a large decrease in
mass from 250 to 360 °C and a small decrease from 370 to 500
°C, which accounts for the volatilization of NH3.
Another step is observed at 500 °C, which can be assigned to
condensation of melem to g-C3N4, and above 540
°C, g-C3N4 undergoes mass loss due to decomposition
till 610 °C (Figure S8b). In the case
of the mixture with optimum ratio of precursors (Figure 7), we could interpret the steps
of formation of the CCN-40 nanocomposite. The five molecules of water
of crystallization were completely removed from CuSO4·5H2O within the temperature of 250 °C with a weight loss
of 22% (theoretical 12.5% i.e., 2.5 for each water molecule). The
excess weight loss was probably due to expulsion of NH3 during condensation of melamine, which also begins around this temperature.
We observe the release of NH3 between 250 and 450 °C,
with the formation of portions of melam, melem, and g-C3N4 and also the sublimation and expulsion of portions
of melamine derivatives within this temperature (as it is an open
system analysis).19 It is very interesting
to note that temperature-dependent XRD results unequivocally confirm
the decomposition of CuSO4·5H2O within
550 °C and the presence of CuO. Although we know that the decomposition
temperature decreases with the incorporation of impurity, for a large
decrease of about 100 °C, impurity alone cannot be held responsible.
Surely, the chemical affinity of Cu2+ to NH3 must be the root cause of such lowering of decomposition temperature.
This drastic lowering of CuSO4·5H2O decomposition
temperature with melamine can be elucidated by the Cu(II)–amine
complex.50 Formation of SO3 is
revealed with a weight loss of 7% (theoretical weight loss of SO3, 10.3%), with a signature of formation of CuO within 550–650
°C, which forms at a lower temperature due to the presence of
melamine.52−54 However, TGA analysis is done in an open system,
which has a different environment with respect to that in the synthetic
protocol followed by us, which is carried out in a closed system.
From the XRD and XPS analyses, we can envisage the onset of the final
reaction step at around 550 °C, the synthesis temperature for
the nanocomposite. Here, we see a lowering of decomposition temperature
of g-C3N4 due to in situ incorporation of copper
oxide particles and quintessential coordination of Cu atoms with nitrogen
atoms of the framework.14,15,18

Reaction steps:  

Syntheses of CuO–Cu2O/g-C3N4 and the Mechanistic Insight
This is the first report,
to the best of our knowledge, of the synthesis of CuO–Cu2O/g-C3N4 by the pyrolysis of melamine
in a semiclosed system, which also contained a copper precursor salt,
by a one-pot method by heating in a furnace. More specifically, weighed
amounts of melamine and CuSO4·5H2O were
taken in the mortar and evenly ground following the grinding–mixing
protocol (GMP)55 so as to obtain a homogenous
physical mixture, which was then taken in a covered porcelain crucible.
Thereafter, it was kept under heat treatment at 550 °C with a
heating rate of 5 °C/min and maintained at this temperature for
4 h. A schematic representation of the process is given in Scheme 1. Thus one-pot method
yielded the CCN-X nanocomposite. The time-dependent
XRD pattern (Figure S1a) shows the syntheses
of CuO–Cu2O along with g-C3N4 gradually. The pentahydrate compound loses five water molecules
in the temperature range of 150–250 °C to form a very
pale blue compound and further strong heat decomposes it to CuO.56,57 The dehydration of the molecule occurs with decomposition of the
tetraaquacopper(2+) molecule. In the second step, two more water molecules
are lost, producing a diaquacopper(2+) moiety. Dehydration is completed
by the removal of the last hydrogen-bonded water molecule. At about
650 °C, CuSO4 decomposes to CuO and SO3. Cu(II) has a rich coordination chemistry because of which in the
present precursor the Cu is directly coordinated to four water molecules
in equatorial positions. The axial coordination is fulfilled by the
O atoms from the sulfate group in the lattice. The fifth water molecule
is hydrogen-bonded between a sulfate group in the axial and water
molecule in the equatorial position. Although the four water molecules
are removed in the temperature range of 150–200 °C, the
fifth one is different in nature and is removed at ∼250 °C,
preceding the decomposition of sulfate anion and formation of CuO
within 550 °C (Figure 7). A unique observation noted was that the decomposition temperature
of CuSO4 decreases by about ∼100 °C because
of the presence of melamine. The onset of sublimation of melamine
is around 296 °C, which peaks at 345 °C.58 However, under slow heat treatment, reflections of melamine
disappear with volatilization of NH3 initiating at 250
°C, giving rise to a new phase of melam and melem. These derivatives
eventually disappear to give g-C3N4 at the synthesis
temperature of 550 °C. Presumably, with an increase in temperature,
melamine sublimes and, owing to thermal condensation, forms polymeric
g-C3N4 intact nanosheets, whereas CuSO4·5H2O loses all its water molecules and gets entrapped
in the nanosheet moiety. Because of the semiclosed system, melamine
does not sublime, instead condenses to form the g-C3N4 moiety. At a higher temperature, ∼550 °C, CuSO4 expels SO3 and decomposes to CuO. We obtain direct
evidence of lowering of decomposition temperature of CuSO4·5H2O and g-C3N4 from thermal
analysis performed. Melamine has nitrogen groups, and also its condensation
releases NH3, which reduces few Cu(II) to Cu(I), as evident
in the XPS analysis.45,59,60 In the present case, the well-established reducing property of NH3 favored the progress of the reaction. However, partial reduction
of CuO occurs and proceeds till the formation of Cu2O and
not further to Cu(0). To confirm our findings, we had also heated
commercial CuO with melamine to establish this partial reduction step
and observed the XRD peaks of both CuO and Cu2O in the
final product (Figure S1b). Thus, CuO−Cu2O entrapment on the g-C3N4 framework
was made possible, thereby creating the CuO−Cu2O/g-C3N4 nanocomposite. It is worth mentioning that no
other copper precursors, viz., CuCl2, Cu(OAc)2, and Cu(NO3)2, were able to yield any nanocomposite
and remain as two distinctly separate compounds as black copper oxide
powder and yellow g-C3N4 powder. This observation
confirms the selectivity of the thermal reaction for catalyst formation
with CuSO4·5H2O.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation
of Thermochemical Reactions of Melamine
and CuSO4·5H2O
A well-defined 2D sheet of carbon nitride is very commonly
reported.
Indirect synthesis of the copper oxide/g-C3N4 catalyst has been reported previously. Boron nitride sheets are
also frequently observed, whereas aluminum nitride and P3N5 sheets are fewer in number because of their preparation
protocol. In all of the cases, high electronegativity of N (3.45)
provokes the formation of N3– with any element having
a lower electronegativity value. g-C3N4 when
heated to about 600 °C gradually decomposes, and the product
yield is low. The CN compound has an unbroken 2D nanosheet structure
at 550 °C. During the condensation process, the expelled NH3 probably acts like a binder to the triazine units to accomplish
a 2D structure, which is most likely due to the hydrogen-bonding property
of the amine groups.44 However, the CCN-40
nanocomposite has a perforated 2D nanosheet morphology, which is probably
the result of SO3 released due to the decomposition of
entrapped CuSO4 within the g-C3N4 nanosheet. The presence of melamine and released NH3 also
reduces a small amount of Cu(II) to Cu2O.45,60,62 When we add NH4Cl
in small proportion in the reaction mixture, we observe a gradual
decrease in the perforation of the CCN-40 nanocomposite, as observed
from the FESEM images (Figure S6), which
is emblematic of the NH3-assisted growth of the 2D nanosheet.
It is confirmed that NH3 released from both melamine condensation
and NH4Cl assists in the formation of a 2D morphology of
the nanocomposite. It is observed that the catalyst obtained with
the added proportion of NH4Cl from 250 to 1000 mg does
not exhibit any change in the chemical composition, as revealed from
XRD peaks (Figure S1c). However, the catalytic
activity of NH4Cl assisted the CCN-40 nanocatalyst drastically
and decreases the reaction rate of 4-nitrophenol reduction due to
decreased perforation.

Nitrophenol Reduction
Because of
the negative effects
of 4-nitrophenol on the environment and human life, it is necessary
to design a cheap earth-abundant catalyst, which can be efficiently
utilized to reduce it into more useful 4-aminophenol. The reduction
of 4-nitrophenol with NaBH4 is a well-studied reaction
as it has kinetics that is convenient to monitor with a spectrophotometer.
The reaction takes place in aqueous medium, making it a benchmark
reaction to test metal and metal oxide nanoparticles.37 The protocol has been used worldwide to investigate the
behavior of catalysts using a UV–visible spectrophotometer.
Hence, we designed a catalyst by tuning the concentration of CuSO4·5H2O in the nanocomposite, to reduce the
nitrophenols effectively to more useful amine derivatives, leading
to sustenance of environment. In this protocol, we study the reaction
by UV–visible spectrophotometry and make important inferences
about the catalyst and its surface chemistry. In the absorption spectra
obtained (Figure S9a), there occurs a prominent
very pale yellow peak of aqueous solution of 4-nitrophenol at ∼315
nm. When 33.32 times more concentration of NaBH4 was added,
the color of the solution deepened to bright yellow, giving absorption
at a red-shifted value of ∼400 nm for the nitrophenolate anion,
which behaves as an oxidant in the presence of reductant BH4–. The bright yellow color is the result of the
extended conjugation, which occurs in basic medium within the nitrophenolate
anion. It is noteworthy to remark that at the mentioned concentration
of NaBH4 in the absence of any catalyst, the reaction is
unable to proceed, as observable in UV–visible spectra (Figure S9b). However, with the addition of the
as-prepared catalyst, there occurs a rapid reduction. The reduction
is also unable to proceed in the complete absence of NaBH4. Hence, we employed our nanocatalyst for the reduction process,
which was carried out efficiently within a span of few minutes. Initially,
the nitrophenolate anion absorption maximum was tracked at ∼400
nm, which gradually decreased at the expense of a new concomitant
peak at ∼301 nm for 4-aminophenol species. The kinetic study
of the reduction reaction was carried out exploring the gradually
decreasing peak at ∼400 nm monitored with a UV–visible
spectrophotometer. The two isosbestic points at ∼311 and ∼280
nm confirm the yield of a single product.8

In our investigation, we studied in detail the UV–vis
spectra of the 4-nitrophenolate anion upon addition of the as-prepared
catalyst in the presence of NaBH4 in aqueous medium. We
acquired absorption spectra in each case for our as-prepared CCN-X nanocomposites (Figure 8), CuO, Cu2O, g-C3N4, and various combinations (Figure S10). From the linear plot of ln(At/A0) versus time (min) (Figure 9a), pseudo-first-order kinetics was established
as expected from all of the catalysts employed. The presence of excess
BH4– ions makes the reaction independent
of this species. The reaction was optimized (Figure S11) for conducting all of the comparative study. The rate
constant was obtained from the above graph, which reveals the reactivity
of the species under the reaction conditions, using the following
equation  For a
comparison of the catalytic activity,
all of the CCN-X catalysts were separately employed
to study the 4-NP reduction under the same experimental protocol.
The ln(At/A0) versus time (min) graph gave a straight line for all of the catalysts
with a negative slope explaining similar kinetics, thereby leading
to an impactful conclusion of their rates. The rates of the reaction
obtained from the ln(At/A0) versus time (min) graph for bulk CuO, Cu2O, and g-C3N4 were 2.29 × 10–2 (R2 = 0.99), 5.01 × 10–2 (R2 = 0.97), and 5.66 × 10–3 (R2 = 0.95), respectively.
From the plot (Figure 9b) a comparative account of the percentage of conversion of 4-nitrophenol
to 4-aminophenol was revealed. We observed that a bare minimum of
16.27% of 4-nitrophenol was converted by pure Cu2O, 13.42%
by CuO, and 2.4% by pure g-C3N4 at the end of
about 4 min, with 1 mg of each of the catalyst used. However, the
ln(At/A0)
versus time plot for CCN-30 gave rate constant 7.24 × 10–2 (R2 = 0.95), which converts
only 19.71% nitrophenol. Interestingly, CCN-40, CCN-50, and CCN-60
gave remarkable catalytic rate constants: 1.19 (R2 = 0.96), 1.16 (R2 = 0.98),
and 0.82 (R2 = 0.96) min–1 with a % conversion of 95.28, 94.22, and 75.82, respectively. The
straight line proves its similarity in kinetics with bulk CuO, bulk
Cu2O, and g-C3N4. These newly reported
nanocomposites, especially CCN-40, are capable of reducing ∼100%
4-nitrophenol within a small time span of 5–6 min. Again, as
we move toward CCN-70, we observe a gradual decrease in the rate constant
to 4.57 × 10–2 min–1 (R2 = 0.97), which converts 8.39% 4-nitrophenol
in 4 min. The results achieved led to the order of the rate constants
as follows: kCCN-40 > kCCN-50 > kCCN-60 > kCCN-30 > kCu2O > kCCN-70 > kCuO > kg-C3N4. The root cause of the
change in the catalytic
activity originates from the copper center. The active copper center
is low in the case of CCN-30, and overloading of copper is understandable
from CCN-60 onward. In both the cases, exposure of active catalytic
sites is insufficient in comparison to that in CCN-40, which gives
the optimum exposure of active catalytic sites in the nanocatalyst.
However, all of the prepared catalysts consolidated the efficiency
of the nanocatalyst in comparison to that of individual g-C3N4, CuO, and Cu2O.

It was confirmed from
the analysis that both CuO and Cu2O remain present in the
CCN-X catalyst and the catalyst
is obtained exclusively from CuSO4·5H2O.
Thereafter, we also tried to synthesize the catalyst using CuO and
Cu2O separately as precursor compounds together with proportionate
amount of melamine and obtained a black powder in both cases. The
catalysts are indicated as CCN-B and CCN-C having rate constants 3.20
× 10−3 and 5.25 × 10−3, and % conversion of 4-nitrophenol 7.75 and 11.15, respectively.
However, they were not as good as the catalysts, CCN-X, and the rate of the reaction was much lower. Furthermore, we employed
different mixtures containing variable proportions of CuO and Cu2O (1:4, 1:1, and 4:1, indicated as CCN-D, CCN-E, and CCN-F,
respectively) together with a constant quantity of g-C3N4 to study the catalysis, and the obtained rate constants
were 1.50 × 10–2, 1.94 × 10–3, and 1.95 × 10–3 min–1,
respectively. The results also consolidated the impactful conclusion
of the superior catalytic activity of Cu2O over CuO.

Hence, the nanocomposite formed from 40% CuSO4·5H2O and 60% melamine by weight, i.e., CCN-40, emerged as the
most competent catalyst with a rate constant of 1.19 min–1. The rate for our as-synthesized CCN-40 is ∼52 times higher
than that of bulk CuO, ∼24 times than that of bulk Cu2O, and ∼210 times higher than that of bare g-C3N4. The catalyst activity parameter (ratio of rate constant
and catalyst dose; i.e., ka = rate constant
in s–1/weight of the catalyst used in mg) of as-prepared
CCN-40 was found to be 2.0 × 10–2 mg–1 s–1. The percentage of conversion of the substrate
was plotted, and the validation of our ace catalyst was revealed from
the order of completion of the product. Hence, we can assimilate from
the above results that Cu2O is presumably a better catalyst
than CuO for the reaction, and their cumulative effect is manifested
in CCN-40.

We have also judiciously exploited our catalyst for
the reduction
of various nitroarenes. The nitroarenes we investigated were 2-nitrophenol,
2-nitroaniline, 4-nitroaniline, 3-nitroaniline, and nitrobenzene.
From the structures of the said compounds, extended conjugation is
expected in three former cases but absent in the two latter compounds.
Hence, we can infer that these two compounds, 3-nitroaniline and nitrobenzene,
will be the least stable anionic species, thereby resulting in the
most reactive compound for reduction. Their absorption spectra depicted
(Figure 10a,b) a rapid reduction within a span of few minutes.
However, in the case of 2-nitrophenol, 2-nitroaniline, and 4-nitroaniline,
extended conjugation is evident from their slower rate of reduction
because of stable anionic species, which are comparatively less reactive.
However, among these three compounds, 2-nitroaniline and 2-nitrophenol
are more reactive because of steric interaction of the bulky −NH2 and −OH groups in the meta position, respectively,
as witnessed (Figure 10c,d). 4-Nitroaniline has the most stable anion in the alkaline medium,
thereby making it less reactive and increasing the time for completion
of the reduction process as evident (Figure 10e).

Figure 12 XRD pattern of the CCN-40 catalyst after
a few cycles of 4-nitrophenol
reduction in the presence of NaBH4.

Again, we also conducted a study to draw a linear relationship
of the rate of catalysis with the extent of perforation of the CCN-40
material. NH3-mediated 2D morphology evolution and subsequent
perforation of the nanocomposite gave us a clue to study the effect
of NH4Cl. Interestingly, we observed that with the increase
in the proportion of NH4Cl the FESEM images show a distinct
decrease in the extent of perforation. This proves that introduction
of NH4Cl induces facile formation of 2D morphology without
the scope for perforation. However, the decrease in perforation of
the 2D sheets results in poor catalysis, as observed from the absorption
plot (Figure 11a–c),
because of the decreased surface area for reaction. The rate constants
of CCN-40 with 250, 500, and 1000 mg of NH4Cl are 1.23
× 10−1, 8.85 × 10−2,
and 2.17 × 10−3 min−1, giving
the catalyst activity parameters 2.05 × 10−3, 1.48 × 10−3, and 3.62 × 10−2 mg−1 s−1, respectively, and
their corresponding conversion percentage of 4-nitrophenol being 8.74%,
4.66% and 0.33%. The observed results (Figure 11d) clearly show that increase in perforation
of the 2D sheets ensures improved catalytic activity because of the
increase in the effective surface area for the reaction to occur,
as conveyed in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Pictorial Representation of the Synthetic Procedure
Scheme 3 Mechanism of 4-Nitrophenol Reduction
in a Perforated Nanosheet Morphology
In general, the catalytic activity of noble metals has
been the
main focus for such kind of reduction, but in recent years, a plethora
of research has been conducted with metal oxide nanocomposites due
to their low cost, facile syntheses, and stability. Our findings of
enhanced catalysis with our as-synthesized nanocomposite are in line
with these reports and can be marked as remarkable as observed. The
reduction is believed to be in sync with the most commonly accepted
Langmuir–Hinshelwood model.37 In
this model, the catalyst surface acts as a scaffold, where the nitrophenolate
anion as well as BH4– gets adsorbed and
prepares the environment for the facile reduction reaction. Being
in the vicinity, the substrate extracts the hydrogen molecule from
the reductant and gets reduced to aminophenol. The two steps by which
catalysis occurs are as follows: (i) adsorption of the substrate and
(ii) desorption of products. Hence, the ease of these two processes
enhances the efficiency of a catalyst. The perforated skeleton of
well dispersed CuO-Cu2O on g-C3N462,63 provides a nanocatalyst with high active site for
the substrate and reductant to bind readily, thereby attracting the
anionic species from the solution into the catalyst framework making
the reduction mechanism facile as depicted in Scheme 3. We postulated that the high reactivity
of the evolved CCN-40 nanocomposite can only be due to the presence
of in situ generated Cu(0) as copper oxides are unable to transfer
electron effectively. CuO–Cu2O having Cu(II) and
Cu(I) species undergoes in situ reduction to give Cu(0), which oxidizes
back to give copper oxide again in the alkaline solution.45 Hence, the in situ generated Cu(0) catalyzed
the reduction process through adsorption of 4-nitrophenol and BH4–, followed by hydride transfer, where the
nitro group is reduced to the amine group through nitroso and hydroxylamino
intermediates, completed by desorption of 4-aminophenol. With the
final step of desorption, the CCN-40 nanocomposite could catalyze
the reduction again.9 Hence, the active
Cu(0) species help in facile catalysis. Nitrogen though being an electronegative
species has lone pair of electrons available. If we observe the framework
of g-C3N4, we can assume that the CuO–Cu2O particles are interfaced with the nitrogen atoms of the
g-C3N4 structure with their available lone pair.
Hence, such electron-rich vicinity presumably also helps in the facile
conversion of Cu(II) and Cu(I) to transient Cu(0) species, leading
to consequential facile hydrogenation of nitro compounds. As NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent, the copper oxide gets reduced
to Cu(0) over time, as evident from XRD patterns (Figure 12), and there is a drop in catalytic activity after about seven
cycles.63

Conclusions
In
brief, we can conclude by emphasizing the novel synthetic strategy
to evolve the nanocomposite of CuO–Cu2O/g-C3N4 from low-cost precursors by heat treatment.
It is noteworthy that only CuSO4·5H2O suffice
to form a nanocomposite from the one-pot reaction with melamine, whereas
other Cu-salts could not form any composite and remained separated
as dark copper oxide and yellow g-C3N4 powder
after the reaction. Various indirect multistep reaction procedures
have been reported previously, but the one-pot synthesis protocol
is reported for the first time for the synthesis of perforated nanosheets
of copper oxide-decorated g-C3N4 nanocomposite.
A definite proportion of the precursor materials is mandatory for
effective catalyst preparation. This article also entails, from the
evidence acquired, that a catalytic amount of Cu2O plays
a vital role in catalysis. The effects of NH4Cl and excess
CuSO4·5H2O uniquely control the 2D morphology
of the nanosheet. In situ produced NH3 (250–500
°C) for 2D morphology and SO3 evolution (∼550
°C) for perforation of the nanosheets have been documented. The
unequivocal activity of the as-prepared catalyst has also been reported
for the first time for nitroarene reduction, which can open gateways
to vital advancement in the field of industrial as well as environmental
chemistry.

Syntheses of CuO–Cu2O/g-C3N4 (CCN-X)
Different CuO–Cu2O-loaded g-C3N4 nanocomposites were
prepared from the one-pot method by heating the well-ground precursors
in a furnace. In a typical synthesis, 500 mg of melamine was mixed
separately with 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70% by weight of CuSO4·5H2O in a mortar to get a uniform homogenous mixture
in all of the cases. The solid-state grinding–mixing protocol
was ensured for a reproducible thermochemical reaction of the chosen
precursors. The mixture was then separately taken in a covered porcelain
boat and heated in a tube furnace in air. The well-ground mixture
was heated to 550 °C at 5 °C/min from room temperature and
kept at that temperature for 4 h. Thus, we obtained CuO–Cu2O-captured g-C3N4 nanocomposites, CCN-X. During this heat treatment in the presence of CuSO4·5H2O, melamine condenses to form g-C3N4 with CuO–Cu2O-immobilized
nanocomposites, whereas in its absence, melamine produced neat g-C3N4 only in the habitual way. During this process,
melamine condenses to form g-C3N4 with the CuO–Cu2O nanoparticle trapped in between. The nanocomposites formed
from variable weights of CuSO4·5H2O and
constant quantity (500 mg) of melamine were termed as CCN-30, CCN-40,
CCN-50, CCN-60, and CCN-70 according to the weight percent of CuSO4·5H2O used. Also, we took the mixture of the
CCN-40 precursor and added different amounts (250, 500, and 1000 mg)
of NH4Cl as a source of NH3 during syntheses.
The as-obtained compounds were then characterized.

Catalytic Reduction
of 4-Nitrophenol
The reaction mixture
was taken in a quartz cuvette, under ambient conditions, containing
3 mL of 5 × 10–5 M 4-nitrophenol and 1.6 ×
10–3 M NaBH4. Then, respective amount
of the as-prepared CCN-X catalyst (1 mg quantity)
was added in the reaction medium, and the decrease in yellow coloration
of the solution was monitored using a UV–visible spectrophotometer.
This experiment was individually conducted with all of the catalyst
systems, viz., CCN-30, CCN-40, CCN-50, CCN-60, and CCN-70. To have
a neat comparative account of catalytic activity, commercial CuO and
Cu2O and g-C3N4 were also employed
individually for 4-nitrophenol reduction. The CCN-40 nanocomposites
prepared from 250, 500, and 1000 mg of NH4Cl were also
tested for their comparative catalytic activity. We carried out rest
of the detailed study on the reduction reaction parameters and other
nitroarene reductions with a minimal amount of 0.20 mg of the as-obtained
CCN-40 composite for an insightful investigation of the reaction.
Each experiment was conducted five times.

Recycling of Catalysts
for 4-Nitrophenol Reduction
After the completion of the first
cycle of reduction of 4-nitrophenol,
the catalyst was collected by centrifugation and washed five times
with water. A fresh batch of 3 mL of solution of 4-nitrophenol (5
× 10–5 M) and NaBH4 (1.6 ×
10–3 M) was taken in a cuvette, and the collected
catalyst was added to it. Immediately, the cycle of catalysis was
monitored by a UV–visible spectrophotometer. All of the reaction
cycles were performed in a similar way.
