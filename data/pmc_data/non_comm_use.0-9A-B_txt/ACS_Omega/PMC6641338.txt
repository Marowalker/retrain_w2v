A series of palladium acyclic diaminocarbene
(ADC) complexes of
the type cis-[(R1NH)(R2)methylidene]PdCl2(CNR1) [R1 = 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2: R2 = NC5H10 (2); NC4H8 (3); NC4H8O (4)] were used
not only to perform the Csp2–Csp Hiyama coupling between aryl iodide and triethoxysilylalkynes but
also to subsequently carry out the one-pot tandem Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization
reaction between 2-iodophenol and triethoxysilylalkynes, giving a
convenient time-efficient access to the biologically relevant benzofuran
compounds. The palladium ADC complexes (2–4) were conveniently synthesized by the nucleophilic addition
of secondary amines, namely, piperidine, pyrrolidine, and morpholine
on the cis-{(2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2)NC}2PdCl2 in moderate
yields (ca. 61–66%).

Introduction
With the success of the transition-metal
N-heterocyclic carbene
(NHC) complexes in homogeneous catalysis being well-recognized now,1−15 their application in more challenging domains of catalysis such
as bifunctional catalysis,16,17 asymmetric catalysis,18 and the tandem reactions19 are of contemporary interest. Alongside, the quest for
exploring new variants of the carbene ligands is being simultaneously
pursued for meeting the demands of these intriguing catalyses.1−3,5,6,20 In this context, a special class of heteroatom-stabilized
singlet carbene ligands in the form of the acyclic diaminocarbene
(ADC) is worth mentioning.21−31 Owing to their remarkably simple preparative procedures, as opposed
to the long and protracted preparation methods of the contemporary
phosphine and the NHC ligands, the ADC ligands have attracted attention
lately.21−31 Furthermore, the absence of any geometric constraints that allow
free orientation of the ligand substituents make these ADC ligands
different from their cyclic ones, for example, the NHC ligands, thereby
imparting different catalytic properties to these ligands. Because
of the aforementioned reasons and also owing to our long-standing
interest in the applications of transition-metal NHC complexes in
biomedical applications32−36 and in chemical catalysis,32,33 we became interested
in exploring the utility of the transition-metal ADC complexes for
various catalytic applications.

The benzofuran compounds constitute
important bioactive molecules
such as BNC105,37 amiodarone,38 cytotoxic flavonoids,39 and the natural products, namely, daphnodorin A and B,40 egonol,41,42 and moracin O and P,43,44 and hence, its synthesis by an
efficient route is of sufficient interest.45−49 In this regard, the benzofuran derivatives have been
successfully prepared by different synthetic approaches50−65 including that of the one-pot tandem C–C bond coupling/cyclization
reactions,63,66−83 and for which, we remain interested in exploring the potential of
transition-metal complexes of various types of carbene ligands as
catalysts for the tandem reactions.19 As
for the first component of the tandem reaction, i.e., the C–C
coupling reaction, we became interested in exploring the suitability
of Hiyama coupling. It is primarily for reasons that (i) the Hiyama
coupling provides a much greener alternative to the Suzuki and Stille
couplings with toxicity issues and (ii) that the Hiyama coupling has
not been explored for the transition-metal ADC complexes thus far.22−24,26,27

In this article, we report a series of palladium ADC complexes
{cis-[(R1NH)(R2)methylidene]PdCl2(CNR1) [R1 = 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2: R2 = NC5H10 (2); NC4H8 (3); NC4H8O (4)]} (Figure 1), whose utility
in Hiyama coupling, particularly of the Csp2–Csp type coupling between aryl iodide and triethoxysilylalkyne,
has been explored. Moving further, the utility of these palladium 2–4 complexes in the more challenging
one-pot tandem reaction between 2-iodophenol and triethoxysilylalkynes
yielding benzofuran derivatives has been studied.

Figure 1 Palladium (2–4) ADC complexes.

Results and Discussion
With the intent of exploring the
application of the ADC ligands,
particularly in more challenging one-pot tandem Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization
reactions, for constructing the biologically relevant benzofuran derivatives,
the following ADC, namely, [(R1NH)(R2)methylidene]
[R1 = 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2: R2 = NC5H10; NC4H8; NC4H8O] was so chosen for the
study. In particular, the ADC ligands were stabilized as their palladium
complexes of the type cis-[(R1NH)(R2)methylidene]PdCl2(CNR1) [R1 = 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2:
R2 = NC5H10 (2); NC4H8 (3); NC4H8O (4)] (Figure 1) and were synthesized from the reactions of the secondary
amines, namely, piperidene, pyrrolidene, and morpholine, with the
metal precursor cis-{(2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2)NC}2PdCl2, at room temperature in moderate yields ca. 61–66% (Scheme 1) along the lines
for related complexes reported by Hashmi and co-workers.84 The metal precursor, cis-{(2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2)NC}2PdCl2, was synthesized following a sequence of reactions starting
from 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (1a) (Scheme 1).85,86

Scheme 1 Strategy for the
Synthesis of the Palladium (2–4)
ADC Complexes
The 1H
NMR spectrum of the palladium 2–4 complexes is worth commenting upon. In particular, the M–CcarbeneN(H)Mes resonance
appeared highly downfield-shifted at ca. δ 8.93–9.30
ppm. Additionally, the 1H NMR spectrum indicated restricted
rotation about the (Mes)(H)N–Ccarbene bond as was
evident from the observation of two aromatic 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2 resonances that appeared in the region ca. δ 7.00–7.09
ppm and ca. δ 6.77–7.02 ppm, and the methyl resonances
appeared as three singlets of 3 protons each at ca. δ 2.39 ppm,
ca. δ 2.28 ppm, and ca. δ 2.25 ppm. The 13C{1H} spectrum of the palladium 2–4 complexes showed the characteristic carbenic M–CcarbeneN(H)Mes resonances at ca.
δ 178.9–181.8 ppm and the Pd–C≡NMes resonances at ca. δ 121.1–122.7
ppm.

Infrared spectroscopy provided valuable insight on the
structures
of the palladium 2–4 complexes. Particularly,
the observation of ν(C≡N) stretching frequencies
in the range ca. 2197–2203 cm–1 indicated
the presence of a palladium bound MesN≡C moiety (Pd–C≡NMes)
in the palladium 2–4 complexes as
was evident by comparing with the ν(C≡N) stretching
frequency of the metal precursor 1d (2214 cm–1). Furthermore, a shift of ν(C≡N) stretching
frequency of ca.75–85 cm–1 in the palladium 2–4 complexes (ca. 2197–2203 cm–1) with respect to free MesN≡C (2118 cm–1) indicated the strong σ-donating nature of
the MesN≡C ligand.

The molecular structures of all of
the palladium 2–4 complexes have
been determined by X-ray diffraction
studies, and they showed that the square planar palladium center is
bound to the ADC ligand moiety [(R1NH)(R2)methylidene]
[R1 = 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2: R2 = NC5H10; NC4H8; NC4H8O] and the mesityl isonitrile
moiety in a cis disposition to each other. The remaining two sites
are occupied by two chloride atoms (Figure 2 and Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2 and Table S1). The Pd–Ccarbene bond distances in 2 [2.006(3) Å], 3 [1.991(4) Å], and 4 [2.011(3) Å] are slightly
shorter than the sum of the covalent radii of palladium and carbon
(2.12 Å)87 and are comparable to the
other related palladium ADC complexes of similar types, namely, cis-[(R1NH)(R2)methylidene]PdCl2(CNR1) [R1 = 2,6-(CH3)2C6H3: R2 = 2,6-(CH3)2C6H3NH, Pd–Ccarbene bond distance is 2.003(7) Å;88 R1 = C6H11: R2 = Ph2C=N–NH, Pd–Ccarbene bond distance
is 1.966(3) Å;89 R1 = 2,6-(CH3)2C6H3: R2 = 5-(NH2)C6H4NH, Pd–Ccarbene bond distance is 1.979(3) Å;90 and
R1 = t-Bu: R2 = Ph2CNH, Pd–Ccarbene bond distance is 1.994(3) Å.91

120.1(3), N3–C19–Pd1 120.4(2), and N1–C19–Pd1
119.5(2).

Quite interestingly, the stronger
trans-effect of the ADC ligand
[(R1NH)(R2)methylidene] [R1 = 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2: R2 = NC5H10; NC4H8; NC4H8O] as compared to that of the mesityl isonitrile ligand
was evident from the observation of a significantly longer Pd–Cl
bond by ca. 0.0571–0.0762 Å located trans to the ADC ligand
in the complexes 2 [2.3825(9) Å], 3 [2.3695(12) Å], and 4 [2.3770(8) Å] than
the adjacent Pd–Cl bond located trans to the mesityl isonitrile
ligand in the complexes 2 [2.3063(8) Å], 3 [2.3124(13) Å], and 4 [2.3075(9) Å]. The
same has been observed in the other related complexes, namely, cis-[(R1NH)(R2)methylidene]PdCl2(CNR1) [R1 = 2,6-(CH3)2C6H3: R2 = 2,6-(CH3)2C6H3NH, 2.3838(18), 2.316(2) Å;88 R1 = C6H11:
R2 = Ph2C=N–NH, 2.3671(17), 2.3232(7)
Å;89 R1 = 2,6-(CH3)2C6H3: R2 = 5-(NH2)C6H4NH, 2.3843(7), 2.3289(8) Å;90 and R1 = t-Bu: R2 = Ph2CNH, 2.3698(8), 2.3241(8) Å.91

Furthermore, extensive pπ–pπ
delocalization
in the ADC ligand [(R1NH)(R2)methylidene] [R1 = 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2: R2 = NC5H10; NC4H8; NC4H8O] was evident from the fact
that the two C–N bond lengths in the complexes 2 [N2–C11 1.328(4) Å, N3–C11 1.330(4) Å], 3 [N1A–C10A 1.329(5) Å, N2A–C10A 1.329(5)
Å], and 4 [N1–C19 1.328(4) Å, N3–C19
1.320(4) Å] fall between the C–N single bond length of
1.469 Å in amine92 and the C=N
double bond length of 1.279 Å in imines.92

Csp2–Csp Type Hiyama
Alkynylation
With the intent of exploring the one-pot tandem
Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization reaction yielding biologically relevant
benzofuran compounds, we decided to explore the first component of
this tandem reaction that tested the ability of our palladium ADC
complexes, (2–4), in carrying out
the Hiyama alkynylation reaction. In this context, it is worth noting
that there exists no report of the use of ADC-based catalysts for
any type of Hiyama coupling reactions. In this backdrop, our efforts
in exploring the utility of the palladium ADC complexes (2–4) in the Hiyama alkynylation coupling reaction
between an triethoxysilylalkyne containing the Csp center
and aryl iodide, a substrate containing the Csp2 center assumes importance (Chart 1).

Chart 1 Hiyama Coupling Reaction of Iodobenzene (5) with Triethoxysilylalkynes
(6–13) as Catalyzed by Pd–ADC
Complex (4)
Significantly enough, a representative ADC complex 4 successfully carried out the Csp2–Csp Hiyama alkynylation coupling between aryl iodide with the
triethoxysilylalkyne substrate. In particular, the Hiyama alkynylation
between various triethoxysilylalkyne reagents covering aryl alkyne
moieties in triethoxy(phenylethynyl)silane (6),93 triethoxy(p-tolylethynyl)silane
(7), triethoxy(4-fluorophenylethynyl)silane (10), triethoxy(4-chlorophenylethynyl)silane (11), triethoxy(4-bromophenylethynyl)silane
(12), and triethoxy(naphthalen-1-ylethynyl)silane (13) to the aliphatic ones in triethoxy(hex-1-yn-1-yl)silane
(8),93 triethoxy(hept-1-yn-1-yl)silane
(9) with iodobenzene was catalyzed by the palladium ADC
complex 4 at 2 mol % of the catalyst loading at 80 °C
in 4 h of reaction time (Chart 1). Interestingly enough, higher yields were obtained for the
aryl triethoxysilylalkyne (ca. 40–76%) as compared to the aliphatic
alkyne silyl ether (ca. 35–41%) reagents (Table 1). The significant amplification
of the product yield for the Hiyama alkynylation coupling reaction
between triethoxy(phenylethynyl)silane (6) and iodobenzene
(5) by palladium ADC complex 4 was observed
when the yield of 76% was compared to the blank experiments that showed
10% of the yield and with control experiments with PdCl2 that exhibited 39% of the yield and with Cl2Pd(MeCN)2 exhibiting 42% of the yield. The homogeneous nature of the
catalysis were further established by performing the Hg-drop experiment
that showed a near-equal yield of (ca. 74%) the product formed in
the presence and in the absence of Hg (ca. 76%) (Supporting Information Table S2).

for 4 h.

b Isolated yields.

Important is the comparison
of the Hiyama coupling products obtained
using our catalyst to those obtained by other reactions. In particular,
diphenyl acetylene was obtained in a 76% yield at 2 mol % of catalyst 4 loading under our Hiyama alkynylation condition, which is
slightly lower than the near-quantitative yield of 99% obtained using
CuI (10 mol %),94 of 94% obtained using
a palladium hydroxysalen complex (3 mol %),95 and of 85% obtained using a [1,3-bis(2,6-iPr2C6H3)imidazol-2-yilidene]PdCl2[3-ClC6H4N] complex (5 mol %)96 using decarboxylative coupling between alkynyl
carboxylic acid with aryl iodide/boronic acid/diazonium salts. Apart
from this, diphenyl acetylene in high yield has been reported by reaction
of aryl halides with alkynyl magnesium bromide in a 94% yield in the
presence of a Cu(I) PNP pincer complex as the catalyst (5 mol %)97 and also by Sonogashira coupling.98,99 Likewise, for other substrates too, the decarboxylative cross-coupling
reaction produced better yields than our Hiyama alkynalation reaction.

The Hiyama alkynylation coupling was also performed under environment-friendly
and much desired fluoride-free conditions.100−104 More importantly, the Hiyama coupling by the representative palladium
ADC complex 4 represents the first ever report of a Csp2–Csp coupling between an aryl
halide substrate containing a Csp2 center and
a triethoxysilylalkyne reagent containing a Csp center.
We have earlier reported the more common Csp2–Csp2 variant of the Hiyama coupling
with the palladium NHC complexes105 and
abnormal NHC complexes.106

A proposed
mechanism involves the generation of palladium(0) species
(A) which undergoes oxidative addition with phenyl iodide
to give the palladium aryl iodide species (B), which
upon reacting with alkynyl nucleophile of the triethoxysilylalkyne
reagent gives the corresponding palladium aryl[Ph(C≡CPh)]alkynyl
derivative (C). Subsequently, reductive elimination from
the species C gives the Hiyama product along with generation
of palladium(0) intermediate A (Scheme 2).

Csp2–Csp-Type Hiyama
Alkynylation/Cyclization
Having successfully performed the
Csp2–Csp alkynylation coupling
between aryl iodide and triethoxysilylalkyne by a representative palladium
ADC complex 4, we proceeded to attempt the more challenging
one-pot tandem Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization reaction for constructing
the much desired biologically relevant benzofuran scaffold. Indeed,
the palladium ADC complex successfully carried out the one-pot tandem
Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization reaction of 2-iodophenol and triethoxysilylalkyne,
giving a benzofuran derivative (Chart 2).

Chart 2 Hiyama Coupling Reaction Followed by Cyclization of
Iodophenol (22) with Triethoxysilylalkynes (6–13) as Catalyzed by Pd–ADC Complex (4)
In particular, the
solvent optimization study carried out on the
representative substrate 2-iodophenol (22) and triethoxy(phenylethynyl)silane
(6) as catalyzed by representative palladium ADC complex 4 at 2 mol % catalyst loading in the presence of NaOH as the
base showed a maximum yield (57%) of the 2-phenylbenzofuran (23) product in the mixed media of 1,4-dioxane/H2O (2:1 v/v) at 80 °C and at 4 h of the reaction time (Supporting Information Table S3). Similarly,
the base variation study on the same two representative substrates
performed using the same representative palladium ADC complex 4 produced a maximum yield of 57% in the presence of NaOH
as the base (Supporting Information Table
S4). The time-dependence study performed on the same substrates using
the representative palladium ADC complex 4 showed saturation
of the reaction yield after 4 h of reaction time (57%) and showed
no significant increment in the yield even after 12 h of reaction
time (59%), and hence, the 4 h of reaction time was chosen for the
subsequent runs (Supporting Information Table S6). The significant amplification of the product yield for
the one-pot tandem Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization reaction for the
same substrates by palladium ADC complex 4 was observed
when compared to the yield of 57% of the blank experiments that showed
no product formation and with control experiments with PdCl2 that exhibited 25% of yield and with Cl2Pd(MeCN)2 exhibiting 24% of yield. The homogeneous nature of the catalysis
was confirmed from the Hg-drop experiment that showed a near-equal
yield of the product formed in the presence (yield of 54%) and in
the absence of Hg (yield of 57%) (Supporting Information Table S7). Furthermore, a catalyst optimization study, performed
on the representative substrate, namely, 2-iodophenol (22) and triethoxy(phenylethynyl)silane (6), displayed
the higher yield for the morpholine-derived palladium ADC complex 4, and which are used for the subsequent substrate scope study
(Supporting Information Table S5).

The substrate-scope study showed that the palladium ADC complex 4 was successfully used to carry out the one-pot tandem Hiyama
alkynylation/cyclization between 2-iodophenol and a variety of triethoxysilylalkyne
substrates with moderate to good yields (ca. 14–57%). It is
noteworthy that a relatively higher yield was observed in the case
of the aryl triethoxysilylalkyne substrates as compared to aliphatic
triethoxysilylalkynes (Table 2).

for 4 h.

b Isolated yields.

In this regard, it is worth
noting that the 2-aryl-substituted
benzofuran framework is prepared by many synthetic methodologies including
directly attaching the phenyl moiety on the 2-position of the benzofuran
ring by various C–C bond-forming reactions such as the Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling,50−55 the Heck/Heck–Matsuda-type coupling,56−59 the Hiyama–Denmark cross-coupling,60,61 and by cyclization reactions of 1-halo-2-(phenylethynyl)benzene
substrates,62−65 and also by tandem C–C coupling/cyclization reactions of
2-iodophenol and phenylacetylene.63,66−83 Of the various approaches employed for preparing the benzofuran
scaffold, the one-pot tandem reaction involving C–C coupling/cyclization
starting from 2-iodophenol and phenylacetylene substrates has mainly
been reported for the Sonogashira alkynylation/cyclization reactions66,67,69,71,74,76−79 and the Heck alkynylation/cyclization.70 Hence, against this backdrop, the 2–4 catalyzed one-pot tandem reaction for the synthesis of benzofuran
compounds represents the first report of a Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization
procedure giving convenient time-efficient access to the class of
biologically relevant benzofuran motifs.

Important is the comparison
of the yields of the aryl benzofuran
products obtained in our Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization reaction
to those obtained by other methods. In particular, 2-phenylbenzofuran
was obtained in 57% at 2 mol % of catalyst 4 loading
under our Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization condition which is lower
than the near-quantitative yield of 93% obtained using Et2Zn (5 mol %),68 of 90% obtained using
a CuI2(pip)2 complex (1%),69 and of 88% obtained using Pd(OAc)2-NCB (5 mol %),107 all obtained using
tandem Sonogashira/cyclization reaction between 2-iodophenol and phenylacetylene
substrates. The 2-phenylbezofuran synthesis has also been reported
in 88% of yield using [1,3-bis(2,6-iPr2C6H3)imidazol-2-yilidene]AuCl (5 mol
%) from 1-(alkynyl)-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-ones.108 Furthermore, 2-phenylbenzofuran has been reported
in high yield (72%) by reaction of arylation of 2-(gem-dibromovinyl)phenols with sodium arylsulfinates using PdCl2 (5 mol %)/Cu(OAc)2 (10 mol %) as the catalyst.109 Using one-pot Suzuki coupling of 1,2-dichlorovinyl
ethers and organoborane reagents, 2-phenylbenzofuran has been obtained
in 75% yield using Pd2(dba)3 (2.5 mol %).54 Furthermore, Heck alkynylation/cyclization reaction
using a palladium-triazole-based NHC complex (1 mol %) produced phenylbenzofuran
in high yields (81%).70 Likewise, for other
aryl benzofuran substrates too, one-pot Suzuki coupling and the Sonogashira
coupling/cyclization reactions produced better yields than the current
Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization.

The proposed mechanism for
the one-pot tandem Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization
is initiated with the formation of the palladium(0) intermediate (A) from the precatalysts (2–4) in the presence of NaOH as the base. The oxidative addition of
the aryl iodide bond leads to the formation of square planar intermediate
(B1) which reacts with the alkynyl
nucleophile of the triethoxysilylalkyne to give the intermediate (C1) that upon reductive elimination
gives back starting intermediate (A) and 2-(phenylethynyl)phenol.
2-(phenylethynyl)phenol subsequently enters the second catalytic cycle
by coordinating with the palladium center in the intermediate (A). The cyclization of alkyne-coordinated species (D) leads to the formation of the benzofuran-bound palladium complex
(E). Lastly, the reductive elimination of the benzofuran
derivative 2-phenylbenzofuran (23) from intermediate
(E) simultaneously gives the desired benzofuran product
along with the generation of the intermediate (A) (Scheme 3). It is noteworthy
that the conversion of 2-(phenylethynyl)phenol to 2-phenylbenzofuran
by the catalyst (4) under the same catalytic conditions
in good yield of ca. 81% further proves that the proposed mechanism
having two consecutive cycles (see the Experimental
Section from page 50, line 18 to page 51, line 13 and Supporting Information Figures S233–S238).

Conclusions
In
summary, a series of palladium ADC complexes, namely, cis-[(R1NH)(R2)methylidene]PdCl2(CNR1) [R1 = 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2: R2 = NC5H10 (2); NC4H8 (3);
NC4H8O (4)] have been
synthesized and structurally characterized. These palladium 2–4 complexes were used not only to carry
out the Csp2–Csp Hiyama coupling
of an aryl iodide containing the Csp2 center
with a triethoxysilylalkyne
containing the Csp center but also to successfully perform
the one-pot tandem Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization reaction of a variety
of 2-iodophenol and triethoxysilylalkyne reagents yielding the biologically
relevant benzofuran compounds. The work represents the first report
of a convenient time-efficient one-pot tandem Hiyama alkynylation/cyclization
reaction for the preparations of the benzofuran compounds.

Synthesis of N-Formyl-2,4,6-trimethylaniline
(1b)85
A mixture
of HCOOH (5.31 g, 115 mmol) and (CH3CO)2O (4.68
g, 45.8 mmol) was stirred at room temperature for 1 h under a nitrogen
atmosphere, after which a solution of 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (5.00
g, 37.0 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (ca. 30 mL) was
added. The temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained between
(5–10) °C during the course of the addition. The reaction
mixture was further stirred at room temperature for 16 h and then
refluxed for another 4 h, after which the solvent was removed under
reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in CHCl3 (ca.
100 mL), washed with a saturated solution of aqueous NaHCO3 (3 × 100 mL) and subsequently with H2O (ca. 100
mL), then dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and finally,
the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to obtain as a yellow
solid. The yellow solid was further washed with hot Et2O to give the product as a white solid (3.77 g, 62%). Isomer (major). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, 25
°C): δ 8.32–8.30 (m, 1H, CHO), 7.17–7.08 (m, 1H, NH), 6.93 (s, 2H, 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2), 2.28

Synthesis of 2,4,6-Trimethylphenyl Isonitrile (1c)86
POCl3 (2.738 g,
18.3 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of N-formyl-2,4,6-trimethylaniline
(1b) (1.00 g, 6.13 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (ca. 50 mL) at −60 °C over a period of 5 min. The reaction
mixture was stirred for another 20 min when NEt3 (5.57
g, 55.0 mmol) was added to the suspension over a period of 10 min
and then the resulting suspension was let to stir overnight at room
temperature. CH2Cl2 (ca. 100 mL) was added to
the reaction mixture, and the organic layer was separated, washed
with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (3 × 30 mL), dried over
anhydrous Na2SO4, and finally, the solvent was
removed under reduced pressure. The residue thus obtained was purified
by column chromatography using silica gel as a stationary phase and
by eluting with a CH2Cl2/CH3OH mixture

General Procedures for Triethoxysilylalkyne
Preparation
A mixture of terminal alkyne and EtMgBr (2.0
M in THF) in Et2O (ca. 30 mL) was added in a 1.2:1 ratio
at room temperature
and refluxed for 2 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature,
and Si(OEt)4 (1.8 times of EtMgBr) was added. The reaction
mixture was again refluxed further for 12 h. The resulting mixture
was filtered, and the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure.
The crude product was then purified by fractional distillation under
reduced pressure at ambient temperature by a Kugelrohr short path
distillation apparatus at the temperature range of 40–60 °C.

General Procedure for the Csp2–Csp Hiyama Alkynylation Reaction of Iodobenzene
with Triethoxysilylalkyne
In a typical catalysis run, performed
in air, a 25 mL round-bottom
flask was charged with a mixture of iodobenzene, triethoxysilylalkyne,
and NaOH, in the molar ratio of 1:1.2:3. Palladium complex 4 (2 mol %) was added to the mixture, followed by 6 mL solvent (dioxane/H2O, 4:2 v/v), and the reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C
for 4 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and
water (ca. 12 mL) was added. The resultant mixture was extracted with
EtOAc (ca. 50 mL). The aqueous layer was further extracted with EtOAc
(ca. 3 × 20 mL). The organic layers were combined and vacuum-dried
to obtain a crude product that was subsequently purified by column
chromatography using silica gel as a stationary phase and eluting
it with mixed medium of petroleum ether/EtOAc to give the desired
product.

Synthesis of 2-Phenylbenzofuran
(23) from 2-(Phenylethynyl)phenol
A 25 mL round-bottom
flask was charged with a mixture of 2-(phenylethynyl)phenol
(0.194 g, 1.00 mmol), NaOH (0.120 g, 3.00 mmol), and catalyst 4 (1.11 × 10–3 g, 0.02 mmol) in the
mixed medium of dioxane/H2O as the solvent (ca. 6 mL, 4:2
v/v). The reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C for 4 h. The reaction
mixture was cooled to room temperature, and water (ca. 12 mL) was
added. The resultant mixture was extracted with EtOAc (ca. 50 mL).
The aqueous layer was further extracted with EtOAc (ca. 3 × 20
mL). The organic layers were combined and vacuum-dried to obtain a
crude product that was subsequently purified by column chromatography
using silica gel as a stationary phase and eluting it with mixed medium
of petroleum ether/EtOAc to give the desired product as a white solid;
yield (0.157 g, 81%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz,
25 °C): δ 7.88 (d, 2H, 3JHH = 8 Hz, C6H5), 7.59 (d, 1H, 3JHH = 8 Hz, C8H5O), 7.54 (d, 1H, 3JHH = 8 Hz, C8H5O), 7.46 (t, 2H, 3JHH = 8 Hz, C8H5O), 7.36 (t, 1H, 3JHH = 7 Hz, C6H5), 7.29 (t, 1H, 3JHH = 7 Hz, C6H5), 7.24 (t, 1H, 3JHH = 8 Hz, C6H5), 7.04 (s, 1H, C8H5O). 13C{1H} NMR (CDCl3, 125 MHz, 25 °C): δ 156.1 (C8H5O), 155.0 (C8H5O), 130.6
