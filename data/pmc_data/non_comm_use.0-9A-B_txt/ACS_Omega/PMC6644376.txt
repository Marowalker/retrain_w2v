A one-pot synthesis of 2-(het)aryl/alkyl-3-cyanobenzofurans
has
been reported. The overall sequence involves base-induced reaction
of 2-(2-bromoaryl)-3-(het)aryl-3-(methylthio)acrylonitriles with benzyl
carbamate, generating α-(het)aroyl-α-(2-bromoaryl)acetonitriles,
which are in situ subjected to copper-catalyzed intramolecular O-arylation, furnishing the 2-(het)aryl/alkyl-3-cyanobenzofurans
in high yields. A probable mechanism for the base-induced cleavage
of 2-(2-bromoaryl)-3-(het)aryl-3-(methylthio)acrylonitriles to α-(het)aroyl-α-(2-bromoaryl)acetonitriles
in the presence of benzyl carbamate has been proposed.

Introduction
Substituted benzofuran
derivatives have drawn considerable attention
for their wide distribution in naturally occurring and designed molecules,1,2 displaying a diverse range of useful biological activities.3 Examples include amiodarone, a clinically used
drug for controlling intractable cardiac arrhythmias3a and daphnodorin A and B displaying α-glucosidase
inhibitory, antifungal, insecticidal, and antitumor activities.3b A few of the synthetic benzofuran derivatives
also act as inhibitors of receptor kinases for treatment of disorders
related to angiogenesis.3a Consequently,
development of new efficient methods for the assembly of substituted
benzofurans is of considerable interest, and a number of approaches
for the construction of this privileged structure have been described
in the literature,3−6 including many based on transition-metal catalysis2−4,6 and intramolecular hydroalkoxylation
of o-alkynylphenols.5a−5d

During the course of our
studies directed toward synthesis of heterocycles
employing organosulfur intermediates,7 we
have recently reported a novel route to substituted 2-(het)aryl-3-cyanoindoles 3 from 2-(2-bromoaryl)-3-(het)aryl-3-(methylthio)acrylonitriles 1 involving displacement of (methylthio) group by amines,
followed by copper-catalyzed intramolecular heterocyclization of the
in situ-generated enaminonitriles 2 (Scheme 1).8

Scheme 1 Previous Synthesis of Substituted
Indoles
In continuation of
these studies, we considered synthesizing N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)indole 6, following a
similar strategy, by initially reacting 1a with benzyl
carbamate 4a under basic conditions, followed by Cu(I)-catalyzed
intramolecular cyclization of the corresponding N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)enaminonitriles 5. However, work-up
of the reaction did not yield the expected indole 6 but
the product isolated was found to be 3-cyano-5-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)benzofuran 7a (Scheme 2). Subsequently, we found that the initial product, formed by the
reaction of benzyl carbamate and 1a in the presence of
NaH, was not the expected enaminonitrile 5 but was characterized
as α-aroyl-α-(2-bromoaryl)acetonitrile 8a. Apparently, intramolecular heterocyclization of 8a in the presence of copper catalyst afforded the benzofuran 7a (Scheme 2). This unexpected result prompted us to investigate the potential
of this protocol for general synthesis of substituted 2-(het)aryl-3-cyanobenzofurans 7 directly from 2-(2-bromoaryl)-3-(methylthio)acrylonitriles 1. 2-Aryl-3-cyanobenzofurans have been shown to be intermediates
for the synthesis of hepatitis C virus inhibitors.6a A few of these 3-cyano-2-arylbenzofurans are also found
to be efficient blue light emitting fluorophores.6a Some of the reported methods for this class of compounds
include transition-metal-catalyzed cyanation of 3-halobenzofurans,6a palladium-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization
of E-3-aryloxyacrylonitriles,4c FeCl3-mediated ring closure of α-aryl
ketones via C7a–O bond formation,6f and copper-catalyzed condensation rearrangement of arylacetonitriles
and o-hydroxybenzaldehydes.6a

Scheme 2 Attempted Synthesis of N-(Benzyloxycarbonyl)indole
and Formation of Benzofuran
Results and Discussion
We first examined the optimal
reaction conditions for the formation
of α-aroyl-α-(2-bromoaryl)acetonitrile 8a from 3-(methylthio)-2-(2-bromoaryl)acrylonitrile 1a. Thus, when 1a was reacted with benzyl carbamate 4a (2 equiv.), in the presence of 2 equiv. of NaH in dimethylformamide
(DMF), the ketonitrile 8a was obtained in 84% yield (Scheme 3). However, in the
presence of solvents, like tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, or weaker
bases like potassium or cesium carbonate, the starting material 1a remained unchanged, although in the presence of potassium-t-butoxide as base, 8a was obtained in 50%
yield (Scheme 3).9 The ketone 8a was subjected to intramolecular
heterocyclization in the presence of 10 mol % Cu(I) iodide, NaH (2
equiv.), and l-proline (20 mol %) as ligand in DMF as solvent,
furnishing 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-cyano-5-methoxybenzofuran 7a in 83% yield (Scheme 3).

These
optimal reaction conditions were used throughout our studies
for the one-pot synthesis of various substituted benzofuran 7 without the isolation of ketonitrile 8 (Table 1). Thus, 1b–d bearing both electron-rich and electron-poor
substituents on aryl ring underwent cyclization smoothly, yielding
benzofuran 7b–d in good to high yields
(Table 1, entries 2–4).
Similarly, the 3-cyanobenzofuran 7e–k bearing 2-(het)aryl groups could also be synthesized from the respective
2-(2-bromoaryl)-3-(het)arylacrylonitrile 1e–k in good yields (Table 1, entries 5–11). It was also possible to synthesize
2-alkylbenzofuran 7l–m in reasonably
good yields from the respective precursors 1l–m (Table 1,
entries 12–13). Similarly, the corresponding naphtho[1,2-b]furan 7n–o could also
be obtained in good yields from the corresponding 2-bromonaphthyl
precursors 1n–o under identical conditions
(Table 1, entries 14–15).
The reaction could also be extended for the synthesis of heterofused
furans such as furo[2,3-b]pyridine 7p–q in good yields from the corresponding 2-bromopyridyl
precursors 1p–q, respectively (Table 1, entries 16–17).
However, the corresponding 2-(2-bromoaryl)-3-(methylthio)acrylate 1s failed to yield the desired 3-carboethoxy-2-arylbenzo[b]furan 7s under similar conditions, furnishing
only an intractable mixture of products (Table 1, entry 18).

in
DMF (5 mL), stirred for 6 h at 90 °C, monitored by thin-layer
chromatography (TLC); Cul (10 mol %) and l-proline (20 mol
%) were added and heated at 90 °C for 6–8 h.

b Only intractable mixture of products
was obtained.

Mechanistic Studies
As shown in Scheme 3, benzofuran 7 are formed by
intramolecular copper-catalyzed cross-coupling of in situ-generated
α-aroyl-α-(2-bromoaryl)acetonitrile 8. We
therefore examined the mechanism of the formation of 8 from 1 in the presence of benzyl carbamate 4a under basic conditions. Thus, 1a was reacted with various
alkyl/aryl carbamates 4a–d under
identical conditions and the results are depicted in the Table 2. The reaction of 1a with benzyl carbamate 4a at 60 °C for
2 h furnished an inseparable mixture of 8a and β-benzyloxyacrylonitrile 9a (R = C6H5CH2−)
(Table 2, entry 1).10 However, when the reaction was continued for
6 h at 90 °C, the ketone 8a was obtained exclusively
in 80% yield (Table 2, entry 2). On the other hand, 1a remained unchanged,
when reacted with either t-butyl, phenyl, or ethyl
carbamate 4b–d, with no trace of 8a, 9b (R = t-Bu), 9c (R = Ph), or 9d (R = Et), even after prolonged heating
(Table 2, entries 3–5).
However, the reaction of 1a with excess of ethyl carbamate 4d (5 equiv.), at lower temperature, yielded an inseparable
mixture of 9d along with a minor amount of starting material 1a and 8a after 6 h (Table 2, entry 6),10 which
on prolonged heating (24 h) was completely converted to 8a in high yield under similar conditions (Table 2, entry 7).

d Reaction was conducted with 5 equiv.
of ethyl carbamate (4d) and NaH (5 equiv.).

On the basis of these studies, we
have suggested a probable mechanism
for the formation of 8 from 1 in the presence
of benzyl/ethyl carbamate 4a or 4d, as shown
in Scheme 4. Thus,
base-mediated decarbamoylation of 4a or 4d releases benzyloxy or ethoxy anions, respectively,11,12 which undergo nucleophilic displacement on 1, yielding
3-benzyloxy/ethoxy-2-(2-bromoaryl)acrylonitriles 9a or 9d, respectively. The compound 9 appears to undergo
facile cleavage to α-aroyl-α-arylacetonitriles 8 via attack of a nucleophilic species on the intermediate 11. The corresponding t-butoxy and phenoxy anions
generated from the respective carbamates 4b–c, being bulkier and poor nucleophiles, do not react with 1, to give the corresponding 3-(t-butoxy/phenoxy)-2-(2-bromoaryl)acrylonitriles 9b–c (Table 2). The facile decomposition of 3-benzyloxy-2-(2-bromophenyl)acrylonitrile 9a to 8a appears to be due to steric crowding
in 9a, because of the presence of 2-bromo group. This
was further supported by the observation that when 3-(methylthio)-2,3-bis(aryl)acrylonitrile 13 without any 2-bromo substituent, was reacted with benzyl
carbamate under identical conditions, at room temperature, the β-benzyloxyacrylonitrile 14 was obtained within 0.5 h, in 85% yield. When the same
reaction was continued at 60 °C, for 12 h, the corresponding
α-(aroyl)-α-arylacetonitrile 15 was obtained
as an exclusive product in high yield (Scheme 5).

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a novel one-step
synthesis of substituted
2-(het)aryl-3-cyanobenzofurans involving base-induced reaction of
2-(2-bromoaryl)-3-(methylthio)-3-(het)arylacrylonitriles with benzyl
carbamate and subsequent Cu(I)-catalyzed heterocyclization of the
in situ-generated α-(het)aroyl-α-(2-bromoaryl)acetonitriles.
Although syntheses of substituted benzo[b]furans
via C7a–O bond formation by palladium4a,4c or copper3a,3c,6d-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of α-(2-haloaryl)ketones13 have been reported, the present method describes
a mechanistically interesting, high-yield approach for 3-cyano-2-(het)arylbenzofurans
directly from 2-(2-bromoaryl)-3-(methylthio)-3-(het)arylacrylonitriles.
The 3-cyano-2-aryl/alkyl benzofurans have been synthesized via FeCl3-mediated oxidative ring closure of α-arylketonitriles;6f however, the reaction is limited only to substrates
with electron-donating groups on benzene ring. Further work to extend
this benzofuran synthesis for some biologically important molecules
is in progress in our laboratory.

Experimental Section
General
Information
All reactions were monitored by
thin-layer chromatography using standard silica gel plates and visualized
with UV light. Purification of compounds was performed by column chromatography
using 60–120 mesh silica gel. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra
were recorded on a 400 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer with CDCl3 (or) DMSO-d6 as solvent with residual
solvent protons as internal standard (δ 7.26 for CDCl3 and δ 2.50 for DMSO-d6 in 1H NMR and δ 77.16 for CDCl3 and δ 39.52
for DMSO-d6 in 13C NMR). Chemical
shifts were reported in δ ppm, and the coupling constants were
reported as J values in Hertz (Hz). Splitting patterns
have been designated as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet),
quin (quintet), dd (double doublet), dt (doublet of triplet), td (triplet
of doublet), ddd (doublet of doublet of doublet), m (multiplet), and
br (broad). Infrared spectra and high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) were recorded in attenuated total reflectance mode using the
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy instrument and quadrupole
time-of-flight spectrometer, respectively. Melting points (uncorrected)
were obtained using an electrothermal capillary melting point apparatus.
X-ray crystal data was recorded on a diffractometer using Mo Kα
radiation (λ = 0.710 73 Å), at room temperature.
The structure was solved by direct methods SHELXS-97 and refined by
full-matrix least squares against F2 using
SHELXS-97 software.

The desired β-(methylthio)-β-(het)arylacrylonitrile
precursors 1a–s were prepared according
to our earlier reported procedures.8a The

The substrate 1a remained unchanged,
when heated with sodium hydride in DMF in the absence of benzyl carbamate
under identical conditions.


Because of the similar Rf of 1a, 9d, and 8a,
it was not possible to isolate pure 3-ethoxy-2-(2-bromophenyl)acrylonitrile 9d from the reaction mixture by column chromatography.


Alkyl carbamates are known to
undergo decarbamoylation
in presence of base to alcohols, see;

acid . Chem. Rev.

When benzyl carbamate
was reacted in the
presence of sodium hydride (2 equiv.) in DMF at 90 °C for 3 h,
in the absence of 1a, work-up of the reaction mixture
yielded benzyl alcohol in 90% yield.
