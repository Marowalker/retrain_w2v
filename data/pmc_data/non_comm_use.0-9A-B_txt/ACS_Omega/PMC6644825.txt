Iron(III) catecholates
of BODIPY (boron-dipyrromethene)-conjugated
dipicolylamine ligands, viz. [Fe(L1)(cat)Cl] (1) and [Fe(L2)(cat)Cl] (2) (H2cat
= catechol), with a ligand-to-metal charge transfer band at ∼800
nm were studied for their in vivo activity in dark and infrared light
in luciferase-expressing human breast adenocarcinoma (BT474luc) cells.
Complex 2 displayed in vitro photocytotoxicity in BT474luc
cells (IC50: 6 μM) in infrared light of 600–720
nm with moderate dark toxicity (IC50: 18 μM) as evidenced
from the MTT and Annexin-V FITC/PI staining assays. The mitochondria-localizing
complexes showed apoptotic cell death involving reactive oxygen species
whose generation was evidenced from 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate
assay. In vivo studies showed tumor growth inhibition in mice with
an optimized complex 2 dose of 5 mg per kg body weight
on exposure to infrared light of 685 nm (dose of 20 mW/cm2). The in vivo results exemplify complex 2 as a unique
iron-based infrared-active photochemotherapeutic agent.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
chemotherapeutic action of cisplatin (CP) and its analogues
is based on the formation of Pt-DNA adducts, which leads to cell death.1,2 CP with its transcription inhibition property suffers from undesirable
side effects and drug resistance.3,4 A chemotherapeutic
drug is desired to fulfill the following criteria for its improved
efficacy: (i) good selectivity between normal and cancer cells, (ii)
localization inside cellular organelles such as mitochondria in preference
to the nucleus to circumvent the nucleotide excision repair (NER)
mechanism, and (iii) fluorescent property for cellular imaging to
track the drug in vivo for understanding the mechanism of drug action
from the in vitro studies. These requirements have necessitated design
and development of new generation of drugs including those of transition
metal-based.5−8 Iron is a natural choice as a substitute of platinum for its biocompatibility
and based on the utility of bleomycins (BLMs) as iron-based anticancer
agents.9−12 BLMs are glycopeptide antitumor antibiotics that cleave DNA in an
oxidative manner.12−15 The structure of BLMs consists of three major domains having different
functional roles with the chelation unit binding iron and activating
molecular oxygen. Hertzberg and Dervan reported the model iron complex
with the N-terminus domain and showed that methidiumpropyl-EDTA in
the presence of ferrous ion and oxygen in an in situ reaction cleaves
DNA in an oxidative manner generating radicals.13

The present work stems from our interest to design
iron-based photochemotherapeutic
agents for in vivo applications. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) as a non-invasive
therapeutic method is evolved with the combination of a photosensitizer
(e.g., haematoporphyrin base), molecular oxygen, and visible light
to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS).16−18 Borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes as theranostics have excellent
photophysical properties with different cores suitable for imaging
and/or generating ROS on light activation.19,20 By appending a BODIPY moiety on a drug molecule, one can also achieve
organelle-specific targeting along with its bio-imaging property.21,22

2 Results and Discussion
We have chosen BODIPY
dyes as photosensitizers for generating ROS
using low-energy visible light which has good tissue penetration power
in the visible region.23 Accordingly, we
have designed, synthesized, and recently reported BODIPY-appended
iron(III) catecholates, viz. [Fe(L1/L2)(cat)Cl]
(L1 in 1; L2 in 2),
of BODIPY-conjugated dipicolylamine (dpa) ligands L1 and
L2 (Figure 1).24 The complexes reported to show significant
in vitro PDT activity in infrared light with IC50 values
of 12.5–19.5 μM with moderate dark toxicity in breast
cancer MCF-7 cells and cervical HeLa cancer cells (λ = 600–720
nm, Waldmann PDT 1200 L). The complexes exhibited a ligand to metal
charge transfer (LMCT) band within 675–790 nm and this spectral
property was earlier used to study their in vitro photocytotoxicity
in infrared light (Figure 1).25 Both the complexes were stable
up to 48 h in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)–Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) of pH 7.2 in the dark. Imaging study
with the highly fluorescent complex 1 showed its significant
localization within the mitochondria with a moderate Pearson’s
coefficient value. Complex 2 displayed DNA-binding ability
implying mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA) as a possible target which lacks
the NER mechanism. Both the complexes were able to generate singlet
oxygen and hydroxyl radicals as the ROS, causing apoptotic cell death
in the presence of light. Herein, we present the in vivo activity
of complex 2 in the dark and infrared light (λ
= 685 ± 10% nm, 20 mW/cm2, model BTL 4110 premium
with 50 mW power) in luciferase-expressing human breast adenocarcinoma
cells (BT474luc), following steps that are shown in Scheme 1. In addition, the in vitro
photocytotoxicity study on complex 2 was made in human
breast adenocarcinoma BT474luc cells in infrared light of 600–720
nm (light dose: 30 J cm–2, Waldmann photoreactor)
to have a better understanding of the in vivo and in vitro data.

Process in Vivo Using
an Iron(III) Complex, [FeIII(L2)(cat)Cl] (2), Having Diiodo–BODIPY Moiety in L2, in
Infrared Light of 685 nm
Although several biocompatible metal complexes are known
to act
as potential candidates from the in vitro study, the reports on their
in vivo activity are rare in the literature.26 The photocytotoxicity of complex 2 in MCF-7 and HeLa
cancer cells under infrared light irradiation has prompted us to study
its anticancer potential in vitro and in vivo in BT474luc cancer cell
line.24 The anticancer activity of complex 2 was studied by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for
complex 2 was 6 μM in BT474luc cancer cells in
infrared light of 600–720 nm with relatively lower dark cytotoxicity
(18 μM). The generation of ROS in BT474luc cells was evidenced
from the 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) assay by recording
the green fluorescence (λem = 525 nm, λex = 488 nm) of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
(2,7-DCF), which is formed by the oxidation of hydrolyzed DCFDA (Figure 2a). Cells were treated
with complex 2 at its IC50 value of 6 μM
followed by 4 h of post incubation and infrared light photo-irradiation.
A substantial positive shift in the fluorescence was observed upon
photo-irradiation of the BT474luc cancer cells with infrared light
in the presence of the complex 2 in comparison to those
kept in the dark. Cellular localization was studied in BT474luc cells
to have an insight about the pharmacokinetics of the complexes. Complex 1 being green fluorescent (ΦF = 0.1, λex = 465 nm in DMSO) was chosen for the localization study
in the cancer cells by confocal microscopy.

Figure 2 (a) DCFDA assay for generation
of ROS in BT474luc cells upon exposure
to infrared light of 600–720 nm. (b) Confocal microscopic image
of complex 1 (5 μM) showing its green emission
in BT474luc cells on 4 h incubation in the dark and on merging with
MitoTracker red and nuclear-staining dye DAPI displayed significant
mitochondrial localization of the complex.

The co-localization experiments were carried out using nucleus-specific
blue-emitting dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and
mitochondria-specific dye MitoTracker red with infrared emission.
The cells were incubated with the fluorescent complex 1 (5 μM) at 37 °C for 4 h and then subjected to confocal
imaging. The merged CLSM (confocal laser scanning microscopy) images
showed that complex 1 was localized significantly in
the mitochondria of the cells as evidenced from the yellow color in
the merged image and Pearson’s coefficient value of ∼0.6
(Figures 2b and S2, Supporting Information).27 The results on BT474luc cells are in accordance to our earlier findings
using HeLa and MCF-7 cells.24

To
study the cell death induced by complex 2 both
under infrared light and dark, two sets of BT474luc cells were treated
with 6 μM of the complex followed by 4 h incubation in the dark.
One of the two sets were subjected to infrared light irradiation (λ
= 600–720 nm, light dose: 30 J cm–2) and
the other was kept in the dark following standard protocols. The assay
was carried out after 16 h of post-incubation followed by treating
with propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin-V FITC as trackers by flow
cytometry. The red-emitting PI dye was used as a marker that intercalates
with the DNA and stains only the necrotic cell population. Annexin-V,
a calcium-dependent protein, binds to phosphatidylserine exposed on
the outer surface of the cells because of membrane flipping in cells
undergoing apoptosis. The double positive population has cells that
are in late apoptosis with compromised cell membrane.

Complex 2 was observed to induce apoptosis in BT474luc
cells both on irradiation with infrared light (600–720 nm)
and on keeping in the dark (Figure 3). About 95% of the cell population under irradiation
with infrared light and ∼85% of the cell population under darkness
were found to be in their apoptotic stage, whereas the population
of cells in necrosis mode (stained with PI) was significantly low,
which also suggests an overall apoptotic mode of cell death. The cell
death in the dark mimics the anticancer activity of iron-BLMs, following
a mechanistic pathway in which the Fe(III)–catecholate moiety
with a redox active catechol unit having a redox potential of ∼0.4
V versus SCE (saturated calomel electrode) can generate radical species.24 The enhancement of cellular death on light activation
is related to the photo-Fenton effect in which light irradiation could
potentially generate metal-mediated radical species involving the
iron(III) catecholate moiety with a conversion to the reactive Fe(II)–semiquinone
moiety, namely, Fe(III)–cat → FeII–cat•–, on photo-activation of the LMCT band at ∼800
nm (H2cat, catechol).28 The
cat•– can generate hydroxyl radicals as the
ROS on reacting with molecular oxygen.

The in vivo anticancer activity
of complex 2 against
human breast adenocarcinoma (BT474 cell line) in nude mice was studied.
About 106 BT474luc cells were injected subcutaneously over
the flank on each side of the mice. Tumor bearing mice were divided
into two groups: a test group, which was treated with complex 2 at an optimized dose of 5 mg/kg body weight, and a control
group. The mice were protected from light. For each mouse, one tumor
was photo-irradiated with infrared light (685 nm ± 10%, 20 mW/cm2, BTL 4110 premium with 50 mW) 4 h after injection of complex 2 and the other tumor
was protected from any light exposure. The tumors were monitored on
a weekly basis by tumor diameter measurements and in vivo imaging
for 15 days.

Fifteen days after the treatment, the tumor volume
was found to
be significantly lower in the light-treated group in comparison to
the control group kept in the dark as can be seen from the in vivo
imaging data (Figure 4a). On the 15th day, the animals were sacrificed, and the tumors
were photographed and weighed (Figure 4b). Normalized photon flux of luciferase expressing
tumor cells in control and treated groups clearly indicates that the
treated group of complex 2 showed significant inhibitions
in luciferase signal as compared to the control group (Figure 5a). Tumor volume of mice measured
over 15 days period since the treatments with complex 2 also showed significant inhibition of tumor growth in complex 2-treated mice as compared to the control group (Figure 5c). Consistent with
the tumor volume and in vivo imaging results, tumor weight in the
treated group showed a decrease in weight as compared to the control
group where tumor weight had increased (Figure 5b).

of mice over 15 days period after treatment with 2 [*p < 0.05; **p < 0.005].

Further, for 15 days, complex 2-treated
mice showed
100% survival, whereas the control group showed only 40% survival
(Figure S3, Supporting Information) giving
a clear indication that because of the anticancer activity of complex 2 the tumor growth was significantly suppressed in the complex-treated
mice. Both the tumors were kept under light and darkness in case of
complex-treated group showing inhibition of tumor, which are in agreement
with the results from the DCFDA and Annexin assays indicating the
chemotherapeutic effect of the redox active iron(III)–catecholate
complex. However, there was no statistically significant inhibition
in tumor growth for tumor treated with complex 2 in infrared
light when compared to the one kept in the dark from the tumor volume
and in vivo data. These results are contrary to our expectation and
are in variance with the in vitro data. We speculate that because
the compound is more activatable in green light than in infrared light,
the effect of the light-treated animals might have been compromised.
In any case, complex 2 showed a significant difference
in the tumor growth compared to the untreated animals. In several
recent studies, orthotopic and/or patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
mouse models of cancer have been used to study the drug action in
vivo. Orthotopic models involve the implantation of the tumor cells
in an organ specific manner, which in case of breast cancer model
being the fat pads. This model has advantage over the subcutaneous
models in the sense, the tumors are in a natural breast environment
and if one is studying the metastatic potential it is highly relevant
model. On the other hand, the PDX nude mouse model helps to delineate
the susceptibility of an individual tumor for a given chemotherapeutic
molecule. This is highly useful for predicting response of the patient
to a particular or combination of the drugs.29,30 However, for the present in vivo experiment, subcutaneous xenograft
mouse model was utilized by injecting luciferase-expressing BT474
cells in the flanks of the mice as the metastatic potential was not
tested.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the anticancer
activity of iron(III) catecholates of
dpa-conjugated BODIPY bases was studied under both in vitro and in
vivo conditions using human breast adenocarcinoma BT474luc cells.
The in vitro experiments showed predominant localization of the fluorescent
complex 1 in the mitochondria of the cells. Complex 2 having the BODIPY moiety as a photosensitizer along with
the {cat2– → Fe(III)} LMCT band at ∼800
nm showed generation of cellular ROS on infrared light (600–720
nm) irradiation and induced apoptotic cell death. The results from
the in vivo studies in the dark and infrared light indicated significant
inhibition of tumor growth by complex 2 in human BT474luc
cells with a minor enhancement of growth inhibition on infrared light
exposure. The results are analyzed by invoking a photo-Fenton type
mechanism, mimicking the chemotherapeutic action of iron-BLMs, in
which the redox active iron(III)–catecholate unit could generate
radicals via {Fe(II)–cat•–} moiety,
while photo-activation of the infrared light LMCT band at ∼800
nm being responsible for its enhanced generation resulting additional
growth inhibition. This work exemplifies an iron-based anticancer
agent showing potential in vivo chemotherapeutic and photochemotherapeutic
actions.
