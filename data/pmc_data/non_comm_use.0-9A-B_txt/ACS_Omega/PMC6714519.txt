Cancer
is a major health risk in the modern society that requires
rapid, reliable, and inexpensive diagnostics. Because of the low abundance
of cancer DNA in biofluids, current detection methods require DNA
amplification. The amplification can be challenging; it provides only
relative quantification and extends time and cost of an assay. Herein,
we report a new oligonucleotide hybridization platform for amplification-free
detection of human cancer DNA. Using a large PEG-capture probe allows
rapid separation of the bound (mutant) versus unbound (wild type)
DNA. Next, a supramolecular hydrogel forming peptide attached to a
detection oligonucleotide probe serves as a signal amplification tool.
Having screened multiple short peptides and fluorophores, we identified
the system P1 + cyanine 3.5 that allows for sensitive quantitative
detection of mutation L858R in EGFR oncogene. The
peptide–fluorophore-based assay provides absolute target DNA
quantification at the detection limit of 20 ng cancer DNA versus >500
ng for Cy3.5-labeled oligonucleotide in only 1 hour.

Introduction
Oncogenes are regions
of normal human DNA that upon mutation drive
cancer development and progression.1,2 Point-of-care
(POC) approaches aim for detecting mutations in human oncogenes in
a reliable and affordable way.1 Recent
research on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in human oncogenes
is now being actively translated into diagnostic solutions. However,
DNA samples are subjected to polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) prior
to SNP detection. This raises issues with standardization of PCR,
target quantification, and inability to detect numerous SNPs such
as KRAS G12D, and so forth.1,2 Besides
predicting cancer, SNP in oncogenes is a valuable guide for treatment.
Recurring target oncogenes include PIK3CA, FBXW7, EGFR, BRAF, and NRAS.3 Moreover, various resistance
mechanisms were revealed by SNP profiling in single cancer cells,
suggesting considerable resistance heterogeneity of tumor tissues.4

Performing amplification-free detection
requires a signal boosting
approach that would allow detecting cancer DNA with a required signal-to-noise
ratio at ultra-low target amounts.5 One
way to achieve this was demonstrated by using fluorophore-labeled
branched DNA.6,7 These labeled probes caused an
increase of the signal by multiple fluorophores obtained in the received
hybrids from cascade hybridization reactions.6,7 Another
method involves the direct physical fluorescence amplification mechanism,
based on origami DNA optical antennas.8 Origami DNA is capable of incorporating noble metal nanoparticles,
leading to a plasmonic hotspot for fluorescent enhancement.9 Other amplification-free methods include SERS
analysis,10 piezoelectric plate sensors,11 and Raman spectroscopy-based methods.12

Optical and electrochemical detection
methods are promising approaches
to achieve a sensitive and repeatable assay that is also robust and
quick to use.13−16 Previously, we demonstrated an enzyme-free detection of cancer SNP
using synthetic oligonucleotide probes and fluorescence microscopy.13 Although sensitive, this methodology requires
a significant experimental effort and a confocal fluorescence microscopy
equipment. Thus, techniques with simultaneous improvements toward
high throughput and portability are still appealing.14

Fluorescent readouts are capable of giving rapid
and quantitative
results.13 Therefore, fluorescence is implemented
in various diagnostic tools used in research and clinical practice.17 Latest developments in this field aim at multiplexed
fluorescence readouts by using time responses of color-coded signals.18 Especially in multiplex detection, assay artifacts
due to interference of probes or fluorophores make it important to
select the appropriate fluorophore and assay conditions.19

Generally, scaffolding along biomolecules
is an attractive paradigm
for signal boosting that has been explored in, for example, DNA origami
and DNA–fluorophore signal boosting.8,13 Oligo-
and polypeptides is another class of biomolecules that can form diverse
nanostructures with fluorophores. Peptides are cheaper reagents compared
to large DNA, and their self-assembly is faster than DNA.20−23 As a drawback, the formation of peptide nanostructures is more difficult
to predict compared to DNA. Nevertheless, self-assembly of rationally
designed peptide sequences is emerging as a potential route for peptide
hydrogel design with promising applications in biosensing.21−23 Researchers have successfully designed several supramolecular hydrogels
based on peptides and peptide conjugates with oligonucleotides or
polymers.24−26 It was shown that the peptide sequence is key to
form a hydrogel, and that peptides can be ideally engineered to form
hydrogels with desired properties.27,28 The knowledge
obtained from several peptide sequences and their conjugates provides
an useful insight into the formation mechanism of the gel.24−28 Moreover, the conditions at which gelation takes place including
individual and collective features of each amino acid have been described.29−31

Additionally, fluorescent hydrogels have gained research concern
because of their practical applications as a convenient tracer in
biomedical engineering.32,33 Multiple fluorescence-based
hydrogels have been developed recently by either chemical or physical
immobilization of fluorophores, for biosensing, thermoresponsive sensing,
and hydrogel degradation tracking.34−36 Nevertheless, reported
routes for attaching fluorophores to hydrogels have limitations, mainly
because of the complexity of the hydrogel microenvironment and often
unpredictable interactions with analytes.37,38 As a result, there is still an unmet need in new robust methodologies
for preparation and applying fluorescent hydrogels.37,38

In this work, we aimed at a POC detection for human oncogene EGFR, using a peptide–fluorophore signal boosting
approach. Our hypothesis to be tested was that cancer DNA can be detected
by a specific hybridization probe conjugated with a peptide sequence
that can form a hydrogel. We selected a sequential hybridization methodology,
along with an optical read-out of a fluorophore–peptide hydrogel,
as a robust and accessible method for POC applications.15,16

Results and Discussion
Initially, we performed a screening
of peptide candidates, aiming
at their following properties: (1) ability to form a hydrogel in aqueous
media; (2) non-quenching inclusion of fluorophores into the gel; (3)
linear dependence of the fluorescence signal to the amount of the
added peptide. Based on existing literature,32−38 short charged peptides have a high propensity for gelation in aqueous
media. We included three peptide candidates in this study (Figure 1; Supporting Information, Tables S1 and S2). Among a broad range
of available fluorophores, we used Cy3.5, AlexaFluor547, and anthracene
(AC), as shown in Figure 1C. The rationale behind the choice of these fluorophores was
their high quantum yield and confirmed interactions with biomolecules.39,40 Azide functionalities were incorporated into the fluorophores to
provide an ability of covalent conjugation to a control probe, described
below. However, having an azide is not critical for hydrogel formation
and can be omitted.37,38

Figure 1 Hydrogel formation by selected peptides:
(a) P1 with different
dyes; (b) Cy3.5 with P2–P4; (c) Chemical structures of fluorophores
used in this study. Peptide sequences were as follows: written in
C → N direction: P1, GGKKRRQKGR; P2, RKKRRRRR; P3, GGAAGGAY;
P4, YGGAAGGK.

The procedure for preparation
of hydrogels included mixing of an
aqueous solution of peptide with a solution of fluorophore in dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) and leaving the mixture for over 1–48 h at room temperature.
The quality of liquid → hydrogel transition, if hydrogel formation
occurred, was rated, and each sample was categorized with one out
of three possible statuses: no gel, gelish, and gel. These categories
were given based on the viscosity of the liquid/gel and the visible
behavior of the sample when mechanical forces such as spinning, tending,
and slight shaking were applied. By measuring gelation efficiency
at different time points, we also studied kinetics of hydrogel formation
and fluorescence response of the applied dyes to the amount of peptide
(Supporting Information; Figures S1 and
S2).

Figure 1 shows hydrogel
formation by best-performing candidates. The complete results of the
peptide–fluorophore hydrogel formation screening and their
hydrogel formation rating can be taken from Table S2, Supporting Information. All peptides formed a
hydrogel under the applied conditions. Upon adding fluorophores, P2
and P4 had the best results; whereas P1 formed a hydrogel only with
Cy3.5 (Figure 1; Supporting Information, Table S2). Notably, peptide
P3 showed no hydrogel formation, most likely because of its hydrophobic
properties. Adding fluorophores slightly slowed down the gelation
for P1, P2, and P4, especially in the case of AlexaFluor547. Moreover,
the fluorescence of AlexaFluor547 was completely quenched by adding
all the peptides (Figure 1A).

Fast formation of a peptide hydrogel is a key feature
for successful
POC diagnostics. We investigated the kinetics of hydrogel formation
and optimized the conditions to secure a complete gel formation in
1.5 h (Supporting Information; Figures
S1 and S2). In this experiment, we followed the gelation by fluorescence
response of Cy3.5 which was added to the concentrated solution of
the peptide in 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 110 mM [Na+], pH 7.0. Our data show a 33% quenching of Cy3.5 fluorescence
during first 40 min after adding the peptide and a dye to the media;
after 1.5 h, the fluorescence response does not change. Based on this
result, and on a visible behavior of the samples, we concluded that
the hydrogel formation for P1 + Cy3.5 has been complete in 1.5 h.
In contrast, for P2 and P4, gelation took as long as 12 h upon adding
Cy3.5 (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

Next, we focused on optimizing the ratio of the peptide
to fluorophore
in order to achieve the highest brightness at the lowest peptide amount.
The data shown in Chart S2, Supporting Information, reveal that the most sensitive system is P1 and Cy3.5. In the case
of AC, no clear concentration dependence of fluorescence response
appeared (Supporting Information, Chart
S2). Based on these data, we selected the system P1 + Cy3.5 in molar
ratio 1:10 as the most promising for further POC assays.

We
proceeded with developing a detection methodology for cancer
DNA. The design of the assay is shown in Figure 2. A capture probe is attached to PEG 8×.
According to our idea, PEG would make large size products with cancer
DNA, and in that way, a bound capture:cancer DNA can be easily separated
from unbound DNA (wild type) by size exclusion.41 The detection probe is complementary to the upstream region
of the capturing sequence and contains a terminally attached hydrogel
forming peptide P1. We selected EGFR oncogene for
the pilot study, given its high importance in monitoring multiple
types of cancer including breast cancer and melanoma, as well as its
recently confirmed role in hyper-activation of cancer progression
as a response to immunotherapy.42,43

amplification-free assay and sequences of
its key components. Azide-modified P1 sequence: N3(CH2)5C(O)-GGKKRRQKGR-NH2. LNA = locked
nucleic acid, indicated with a plus in front of a nucleotide letter.
Molecular weight cutoff value of 100 kDa has been selected based on
the calculated mass for PEG-capture probe:target complex bound to
at least one cancer DNA molecule over 1000 nt long.

For the assay, the detection and capture probes have been
designed
using publicly available NCBI data and our previously reported probe
uniqueness analysis.13 Following our previous
studies, we enriched the oligonucleotides with affinity and specificity
enhancing locked nucleic acids.13 Oligonucleotide
1 (ON1) has been purchased as a 5′-amino-modified precursor
and converted to alkyne-modified ON1′ by reaction with STP
alkyne reagent. 3′-Alkyne modified ON2 has been synthesized
in house, using the automated solid-phase phosphoramidite method.
Oligonucleotides ON1′ and ON2 have been characterized by IC
HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS (Supporting Information; Table S3, Figure S3).

Commercially available PEG 8×
azide has been conjugated with
alkyne-modified capturing probe ON1′ under standard CuAAC click
conditions.44 The product has been purified
by NAP-5 gel filtration and characterized by HPLC, fluorometry titration
with complementary DNA, and by denaturing PAGE. HPLC confirmed full
conversion of ON1′ after the click reaction with PEG 8×
(Supporting Information, Figure S4); by
adding a DNA complement and a double-stranded DNA binding fluorophore
Eva Green, we confirmed that all the attached strands in ON3 were
able to form a duplex with the target DNA (Supporting Information, Chart S4). Finally, denaturing PAGE stained with
SybrGreen confirmed a product length of approx. 130 nt (Supporting Information, Chart S5). This corresponds
to attachment of six oligonucleotides ON1 to PEG 8×.

Knowing
the number of attached capture probes per PEG core allowed
us to establish a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) value for DNA binding
assay. Thus, the molecular weight of the PEG–oligonucleotide
conjugate has been estimated as 56 kDa. Upon binding at least one
fragment of genomic DNA of a size over 1000 nt, the weight of the
complex would exceed 100 kDa. Therefore, a MWCO of 100 kDa has been
applied in the assay described below.

Azido-derivative of P1
has been conjugated under a similar CuAAC
procedure44 with precursor ON2. As a control,
we conjugated ON2 with Cy3.5 azide; all the products have been characterized
by IC HPLC and MALDI-TOF (Supporting Information, Table S3, Figure S5).

Next, we conducted a genotyping assay
and benchmarked it to mono-Cy3.5-labeled
detection probe and quantitative PCR (qPCR; Figure 3 and Supporting Information, section 3). For the assay, we used EGFR-mutated
DNA from human cancer cells. The DNA sample has been purified by a
Qiagen DNA work up kit, followed by digestion with EcoRI. This provided
DNA fragments of 7000 bp in average, confirmed by QiaExpert analysis.
The detection assay has been conducted in a 96-well format, which
is suitable for conventional microplate processing and read-out equipment.
At the selected concentration, a signal for free Cy3.5 was 445 ±
2 a.u. When the assay was conducted with a detection probe lacking
a peptide, a background fluorescence signal of 19 ± 2 a.u was
recorded (data shown in Figure S6). A free
Cy3.5 dye has been removed by a triple washing procedure; the complete
removal of the dye has been confirmed by fluorometry analyses of the
washes (data not shown). Along with this experiment, a series of controls
has been performed, including spike-in of wild type DNA into the EGFR sample, adding unmodified P1 to speed up the gelation,
and qPCR. These data can be found in Supporting Information, Figures S7 and S8.

Figure 3 Amplification-free detection
of mutated EGFR DNA
from cancer cells: LOD determination and control with wild-type DNA
for P1 + Cy3.5 (a), vs Cy3.5-labeled detection probe (b). The data
for mutated vs wild-type DNA are shown in blue and red, respectively.
Excitation/emission wavelengths: 580 nm/610 nm.

We observed a concentration-dependent sensing of EGFR DNA by the P1 + Cy3.5 system, with a limit of target detection (LOD)
of only 20 ng cancer DNA (550 pM), versus >500 ng (15 nM) for Cy3.5-labeled
oligonucleotide (Figure 3).

The LOD for the peptide hydrogel assay is similar to conventional
qPCR and is 5-fold lower than for DNA microarrays.45 The LOD of 550 pM is also similar to DNA fluorophore nanostructures
reported before, when a conventional fluorometry has been applied.5 The LOD of our method can be further decreased
by applying advanced optical solutions, reaching previously reported
low femtomolar for a DNA-Eva Green complex.5,13

The detection procedure for our assay is 2-fold faster than for
qPCR (Supporting Information, Figure S8).3 Moreover, the estimated cost for the peptide
hydrogel assay is USD 0.2, versus 0.89 USD per reaction for qPCR (in
house data). Last, the assay does not require handling an enzyme,
dNTP, and other sensitive reagents, which makes it easier to carry
out.3

To verify the assay specificity,
we used the HMC cell line that
does not contain a mutated EGFR. P1 + Cy3.5 assay
showed 99% specificity for the mutated EGFR over
wild-type DNA (Figure 3). We also performed a spike-in experiment, where EGFR DNA was mixed with HMC at different ratios. Using the P1 + Cy3.5
hybridization assay, detection down to 20% EGFR in
wild-type HMC DNA has been achieved (Supporting Information; Figure S7).

The multivalence of PEG capture
probe increases the probability
of cross-binding between DNA strands. This could lead to changes in
the calibration curve at increasing DNA target concentrations. Although
not observed for the double-stranded DNA target used herein (Figure 3), a cross-binding
would be a considerable risk for long single-stranded DNA targets.
This needs to be taken into consideration, and if it occurs, a buffer
composition could be adjusted to more denaturing conditions.

As another control, we conducted the assay with EGFR DNA and P1 + Cy3.5, in the presence of additional P1. We wondered
if having an excess of free peptide could promote hydrogel formation,
leading to higher fluorescence and lower LOD. Indeed, adding 5–10
nM free P1 promoted the gelation which now took as little as 30 min.
However, when adding over 10 nM free P1, the separation procedure
for non-bound DNA and peptide has been complicated and an increased
false-positive signal has been observed (data not shown).

We
assessed reproducibility of the assay by a series of three repeated
independent measurements, in the DNA target concentration range 20–200
ng. The measurements were carried out for EGFR DNA
by our assay and qPCR. The calculated coefficient of variation (CV)
for the peptide hydrogel assay was 1.5–2.5%, and it increased
upon decreased DNA target amount, which is expected. The observed
CV was qPCR was ∼2.6 fold higher in the range 3.7–6.7%
(Supporting Information; Table S4).

To investigate the structure of peptide–fluorophore hydrogels,
we performed a series of molecular dynamics (MD) studies (Supporting Information, section 5; Table 1, Figures S9–S20). In
doing this, we used RPBS PEPFOLD 3 and DINC 2.0, which are suitable
force fields for analyzing peptide folding and interactions.46,47 Our approach to building the structural model for peptide–fluorophore
hydrogel included 4 steps: (1) predicting the 3D structure of individual
peptides; (2) studying self-assembly of each peptide; (3) simulating
interactions of individual peptides with fluorophores; and (4) building
a complete model for the peptide–fluorophore interaction within
a hydrogel.

a RMSD is an average
value for three
lowest energy structures obtained in docking studies.

Our MD results are shown in Table 1 and in Figures S9–S20, Supporting Information. Among all studied peptides,
P1 forms
the most well-defined helix (Figure S9).
P2 also forms a helical motif vs. hairpin formation predicted for
P3 and P4 (Supporting Information, Figures
S10–S12). P1–P4 have almost similar free energies predicted
for dimer structures; however, in P1 and P2, the average distance
between two peptide chains is longer, 6.8–7.1 Å versus
3.4–5.0 Å for P3–P4 (Table 1). This correlates with a lower energy for
docking products of P1–P2 with fluorophores vs. P3–P4.
According to the literature, having a cavity of >5 Å is a
structural
requirement for embedding small molecules into peptide assemblies.48,49 Therefore, P1 and P2 are the most potent candidates, according to
MD, for interaction with fluorophores (Figure 4A).

Figure 4 Structural model (a) and UV-Visible absorbance
(b) for P1 + Cy3.5
hydrogel. The model has been obtained in PEPFOLD 3/DINC2.0 MD and
docking environment. Cy3.5 is shown in yellow. Computed ΔG values for the model are given in Table 1. Absorbance spectra have been recorded in
0.5% DMSO–1× PBS buffer, pH 7.0, using 2.5 μM Cy3.5
and different molar ratios of P1.

Close proximity of a fluorophore to a biomolecule can be caused
by active hydrogen bond formation.50 This
seems to be the case for polar group-rich Cy3.5 and AlexaFluor547,
compared to the longer distance between the peptides to nonpolar AC
(Supporting Information, Figures S15 and
S18 vs Figures S13, S14, S16, S17, S19, and S20). However, a close
proximity of a fluorophore to the biomolecule might lead to quenching
of fluorescence, for example, by the Dexter mechanism or photo-induced
electron transfer.51 To account for this,
we conducted a series of titrations for fluorophores Cy3.5 and AC,
with peptides P1 and P3 (Supporting Information, section 6). A fluorophore has been mixed with a peptide in different
ratios, and the resulting hydrogel has been analyzed by vis absorbance
(Figure 4B; Figure S21), excitation (Figure S22), and emission spectra (Figure S23).

UV-Visible absorbance spectra of Cy3.5 are weakly
changed by adding
P1/P2 (Figure 4B).
This is on the contrary to AC, which exhibits quenching of absorbance
and a 4 nm blue shift of absorbance maxima upon adding P1 (Figure S21). Excitation spectra for both Cy3.5
and AC are slightly quenched upon adding P1/P3, with similar positions
of maxima to vis absorbance spectra. Fluorescence emission reveals
an active excimer formation by AC, with emission maxima at 530 and
585 nm, also in the presence of P1 (Supporting Information, Figure S23). Fluorescence intensity of Cy3.5 is
poorly affected by adding P1 and is slightly quenched in the presence
of P3. For Cy3.5 + P1, fluorescence maxima are bathochromically shifted
by 3 nm compared to free Cy3.5. These results point on two important
structural features of the studied systems which also fit with the
results of MD studies: (1) AC actively interacts with itself by forming
an excimer, and it poorly interacts with P1; (2) Cy3.5 is incorporated
into hydrogel, most likely, by weak hydrogen binding with P1; (3)
upon hydrogel formation, Cy3.5 is positioned into a more polar environment
compared to the free dye, leading to a bathochromic shift of emission
maxima.51

Altogether, our MD data
and optical assays confirm favorable properties
of the P1 + Cy3.5 system for hydrogel formation, accompanied by high
fluorescence intensity of Cy3.5, as a result of several structural
features. First, P1 folds into a helical structure and self-assembles.
Second, P1 assembly creates a series of cavities for embedding Cy3.5.
Third, hydrogen bonding retains Cy3.5 in a complex with P1. Last,
Cy3.5 forms relatively weak hydrogen bonds with P1, leading to its
high fluorescence intensity being remained in the hydrogel (Figure 4A).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we developed an amplification-free detection method
for human cancer DNA. The method is based on size exclusion of mutant
DNA bound to the PEG-capture probe, and on detection by forming a
fluorophore–peptide gel. As a proof of principle, we successfully
detected EGFR oncogene at an amount down to 20 ng
total DNA, with specificity over 99%. However, other oncogenes can
be tested by our approach as well. Our method is simple, fast, and
relatively inexpensive, opening up exciting opportunities for POC
applications. Our structural model explains how the selected peptide
interacts with Cy3.5 fluorophore and might open new paths for developing
amplification-free diagnostic systems.
