Herein,
we report the use of sequential layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly
to design nanostructured films made of recombinant bacterial membrane
fractions (MF), which overexpress cytochrome P450 (CYP) and cytochrome
P450 reductase. The ability to incorporate MF in LbL multilayered
films is demonstrated by an in situ quartz crystal microbalance with
dissipation monitoring using poly-l-lysine or poly-l-ornithine as a polycation. Results show that MF preserve a remarkable
CYP1A2 catalytic property in the adsorbed phase. Moreover, atomic
force microscopy images reveal that MF mostly adopt a flattened conformation
in the adsorbed phase with an extensive tendency to aggregate within
the multilayered films, which is more pronounced when increasing the
number of bilayers. Interestingly, this behavior seems to enhance
the ability of embedded MF to remain active after repeated uses. The
proposed strategy constitutes a practical alternative for the immobilization
of active CYP enzymes. Besides their fundamental interest, MF-based
multilayers are useful nano-objects for the creation of new biomimetic
reactors for the assessment of xenobiotic metabolism.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Human
organisms are more and more extensively exposed to various
xenobiotics, such as cosmetics, drugs, and pollutants.1 These substances may indeed interact with the body and
be potentially absorbed by three different routes: respiratory, oral,
and cutaneous. Accordingly, the evaluation of the potential toxic
effects due to absorbed xenobiotics is highly desired. Over the last
decades, animals have been used as models to investigate and predict
the impact of chemical substances on living human organisms.2,3 However, animal experimentation is more and more subjected to many
restrictions due to ethical considerations.4 Moreover, toxicological tests performed on animal models are difficult
to extrapolate to human physiology so that their relevance is increasingly
questionable.5 In Europe, the regulatory
environment for cosmetic products requires the use of alternative
approaches to assess their safety.6 In
the other chemical industries, regulations are less stringent but
strong ethical pressure has resulted in the application of the 3R
rules for animal testing: reduce, refine, and replace animal models.7

In toxicological assessment, one of the
main issues is related
to the biotransformation of the absorbed chemical substances to metabolites
that may exhibit high reactivity. Xenobiotic metabolism is found in
different tissues,8 including skin, lungs,
kidneys, and liver.

The development of biomimetic predicting
systems that incorporate
xenobiotic metabolisms has been reported in previous studies.9 They are generally focused on the use of cytochrome
P450 (CYP) metabolism, which is considered as the major pathway for
xenobiotic’s biotransformation. CYP is a family of heme-containing
mono-oxygenase enzymes, which catalyze the hydroxylation; epoxidation;
and N-, S-, and O-demethylation of a substrate according to (eq 1) 1  In vivo, the CYP-catalyzed
reaction requires
two electrons, provided by cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and cytochrome
b5 (Cyt b5), and uses the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH) cofactor as a reducing agent.10−12 In eukaryotic cells,
CYP, CPR, and Cyt b5 are located in the intracellular space in the
smooth endoplasmic reticulum membranes and include a hydrophobic transmembrane
binding domain.13,14 The immobilization of CYP and
the preservation (here it is in the sense of maintaining/conserving
the activity) of its activity is thus a challenge, owing to the complexity
of the electron pathway. Many papers have reported different strategies
for the immobilization of purified CYP on electrodes.15 This way of immobilizing CYP eliminated the need for NADPH
and CPR, and the enzyme can accept electrons directly from the electrode.
Another promising alternative consists in the use of microsomal fractions
in which CYP is expressed with its reductases. These fractions may
be obtained from cell centrifugation to isolate endoplasmic reticulum
membranes expressing CYP. In a previous study, microsomes, extracted
from rat liver, were immobilized on an amino silane-modified surface,
revealing promising catalytic properties.21 However, the extraction of these microsomes is particularly difficult
and their relevancy to toxicological tests is poor for the reasons
detailed above. Furthermore, the procedure of immobilization presents
a significant weakness owing to the quality of silane layers on inorganic
supports and their low stability in aqueous media of biological interest.16−19 An alternative way to coexpress human CYP and CPR in microsomal
fractions has been proposed by Blake et al.20 and more recently by Quehl et al.21 The
procedure consists in targeting the expression of a human CYP and
CPR in bacterial membrane fractions (MF) from Escherichia
coli by genetic engineering techniques. Interestingly,
the recombinant CYP produced by this method yields active enzymes
toward a variety of substrates in the absence of Cyt b5.22,23

The aim of this study is to develop an efficient and straightforward
method to immobilize microsome-like structures containing human CYP
coexpressed with CPR and to preserve their catalytic properties for
the assessment of xenobiotic’s metabolism. For this purpose,
we used layer-by-layer (LbL) sequential assembly, which is a versatile
technique for the elaboration of nanostructured films with tailored
properties and functions. This technique was originally based on the
alternating adsorption of oppositely charged polymers, polyelectrolytes,
on a charged substrate.24,25 Electrostatic interactions
have been thoroughly investigated for the construction of polyelectrolyte
multilayers.26,27 Other interactions, including
hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, and van der Waals forces,
have been also studied.28−30 Importantly, the LbL assembly
has allowed a variety of molecules of biological interests to be incorporated
while preserving their structure and bioactivity.31,32 In particular, many studies have reported the immobilization of
purified enzymes, and other active proteins, through LbL assembly
to design specific bioreactors and biosensors. These include glucose
oxidase,33,34 catalase,35 myoglobin,36 etc. In another study, the LbL assembly of alkaline
phosphatase embedded in phospholipid vesicles was explored as a reactor
for mineralization.37 The authors observed
the formation of calcium phosphate mineral within the multilayered
film. Recently, enzyme–polyelectrolyte complexes have been
incorporated in multilayered films showing a remarkable improvement
of the catalytic properties.38 All of these
studies, and others reported in the literature, clearly show the interest
of using the LbL technique for the immobilization of active biocompounds
while preserving (maintaining/ conserving), or even improving, their
catalytic properties. In the present study, the possibility to incorporate
recombinant bacterial membrane fractions in a multilayered film, designed
through the LbL assembly, is investigated and their catalytic activities
and operation stability are evaluated.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characteristics of MF
MF were prepared
from the cell wall of E. coli as described
in the Experimental Section. The composition
of MF was determined by infrared spectroscopy, a technique broadly
used for the characterization of biointerfaces.39Figure 1 shows a typical attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectrum
recorded on a solution of MF (20 nM, phosphate buffer saline (PBS)).
The bands at 1647 and 1557 cm–1 may be assigned
to amide I and II bands, respectively, characteristic of the peptide
bonds found in proteins. The band at 1460 cm–1 can
be attributed to the methylene scissoring mode δ(CH2). Typical bands due to chemical functions present in phospholipids
were also observed. The broadening near 1730 cm–1 may be attributed to ν(C=O) in the ester group of the
acyl-glycerol backbone. The symmetric bending (δs) mode of the methyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom in the
choline moiety ((CH3)3–N+)
appeared at 1416 cm–1, but their asymmetric vibrational
mode, at around 1480 cm–1, was not clearly observed.
The characteristic band due to symmetric and asymmetric stretching
modes of phosphate groups, νs(PO2–) and νas(PO2–), appeared at 1057 and 1250 cm–1, respectively.
It appears that polysaccharides are not present in a significant amount,
but their presence could not be completely ruled out. Indeed, this
would give bands due to the stretching of C–O and C–O–C
groups in the 1050–1085 cm–1 region,40,41 which are overlapping with the intensive νs(PO2–) band. It is worth reminding that the
cell wall of E. coli is composed of
(i) an inner membrane (lipid bilayer), (ii) peptidoglycans, and (iii)
an outer membrane that also includes lipopolysaccharides.42,43 As CYP and CPR are overexpressed in the inner membrane, the procedure
used for the preparation of MF includes an enzymatic digestion of
the outer membrane. This allows the removal of polysaccharides and
peptidoglycans to avoid diffusion constraints toward catalytic activities
of enzymes, leading to the formation of spheroplast.44 This is in accordance with ATR-IR data (Figure 1) showing that MF mainly consists
of proteins, including the overexpressed enzymes, and phospholipids
originating from bacterial cell wall.

Figure 1 Representative ATR-IR spectrum recorded
on a MF solution (20 nM,
PBS) at room temperature.

The stability of MF and their behavior in PBS were investigated
by means of dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic mobility
(EPM) measurements. The mobility of MF in PBS solution was −3.91
± 0.11 m2 V–1 s–1 × 108, as determined by EPM measurements, yielding
the ζ potential value of −52.9 ± 1.45 mV, considering
MF as spheroid-shaped particles (Table 1). This suggests that MF exhibit an overall negatively
charged surface in PBS. According to the literature, the inner lipid
bilayer of E. coli (used for the elaboration
of MF used in this study) typically includes about 75% of zwitterion
(phosphatidylethanolamines) and about 20% of anionic lipids (phosphatidylglycerols
and cardiolipin).42,43

phase from data given in Figure 3C,F (mean values determined by a Gaussian fit).

Typical DLS profiles are presented
in Figure 2A at different
concentrations of MF. Results
revealed a large particle size distribution with a mean value around
200 nm. The polydispersity index, which provides a direct information
regarding the particle size distribution, was around 0.165 nm. This
trend was independent of the concentration of MF solutions. Furthermore,
time-resolved DLS monitoring showed that the hydrodynamic diameter
of MF did not vary with time, showing values around 200 nm (Figure 2B).

size distributions (five runs are presented
in each graph) obtained by DLS of MF solutions at different concentrations
(10, 1, 0.1 nM; PBS) at room temperature. (B) Typical real-time DLS
profile of MF solution (10 nM, PBS).

Additional indications regarding the morphology of MF may
be obtained
by AFM imaging. For this purpose, a glass slide was used as a substrate
for the adsorption of MF. After stabilization in the liquid phase
(PBS), a solution of MF (20 nM) was injected in the AFM liquid cell.
Representative images recorded at the early stage (∼5 min)
and after about 30 min (and more) of MF adsorption are given in Figure 3. Results showed the presence of isolated particles randomly
distributed on the surface (Figure 3A). Typical cross sections revealed that the heights
of these particles may vary from values around 10 nm to values exceeding
50 nm (Rrms = 6.9 nm, Figure 3B), yielding a large height
distribution (Figure 3C). After about 30 min of adsorption, the AFM image showed a noticeable
increase of the particle size and surface coverage (Figure 3D). The height distribution
indicated a higher polydispersity of particle size (Figure 3E,F) compared to that observed
after 5 min of adsorption, and the surface roughness increased markedly
(Rrms = 11.1 nm).

the aggregate heights (n = 78) corresponding to images

The characteristics of MF obtained with the different
techniques
detailed above are summarized in Table 1. It is shown that the dimensions of MF varied noticeably
whether it is determined in the bulk (DLS) or on a solid surface (AFM).
It must be kept in mind that the techniques used provide two different
measurements: while DLS measures a hydrodynamic diameter of free particles
in solution, including a hydration shell, AFM measures the height
of particles deposited on a solid surface. Owing to their softness,
adsorbed MF may be deformed by the AFM tip under imaging. By using
peak force tapping mode, the applied force is lower than that in the
classical tapping mode (applied force ∼ 400 pN) and allows
probing the interface with minimal disturbance. The difference is
thus too large to be explained by the above considerations. The disparity
between DLS and AFM measurements may originate from the conformation
MF adopt in the adsorbed state. Results suggest that MF are flattened
once adsorbed on a solid surface. The adsorption-induced deformation
is, indeed, with a common occurrence for spheroid-shaped lipid bilayer
particles (liposomes) and depends on many factors such as the osmotic
pressure difference over the liposomal bilayer, the strength of liposome–surface
interaction, etc.45−48 To scrutinize the adsorption behavior of MF on the studied surface,
in situ quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring
was performed on a SiO2-coated substrate (Figure 4). The latter technique is
a powerful tool to study the formation of a hydrated thin film on
solid surfaces.49 In aqueous solutions,
this technique monitors changes in resonance frequency, Δf, and dissipation of a coated quartz crystal due to the
adsorption of a hydrated mass. This also provides information regarding
the viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed phase.50 Results showed strong shifts in resonance frequency, Δfn/n, and dissipation
as a function of time for the different overtones (n = 1–13) due to the adsorption of MF on the SiO2-coated surface. The high dissipation values and the strong dependence
of the frequency shifts on the number of overtones indicate the formation
of a soft and highly hydrated layer. Upon rinsing in buffer, MF remained
completely adsorbed on the substrate. The frequency shifts vs time
did not show typical profiles of vesicle rupture,51 suggesting the adsorption of “intact” MF.
The adsorption of vesicles without rupture remains less understood52 compared to that with fusion, a process broadly
used for the formation of a supported lipid bilayer.53,54 Moreover, these studies are generally conduced with monodisperse
liposomes, whereas MF are highly polydisperse (cf. DLS data, Figure 2). Larger MF are
subjected to more extensive deformation in the adsorbed state, but
this behavior is difficult to detect by QCM-D.52 At low surface coverage, i.e., when the hydrodynamic coupling
between neighboring adsorbed particles can be neglected, QCM-D data
may be used for probing the deformation of vesicles in the adsorbed
state.48 This corresponds to short times
after the injection of MF (linear frequency shifts, t ∼ 5 min, Figure 4). In this case, the extraction of particle shape from QCM-D
data (see the Supporting Information for more details, Figure S1) concerns small MF because the adsorption
rate is limited by the diffusion of MF in the bulk so that larger
MF diffuse more slowly. Results showed that the aspect ratio of MF
initially adsorbed on the surface is close to 1 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). This suggests that only
MF with low hydrodynamic diameter (typically <40 nm) did not deform
in the adsorbed state at an early stage. By contrast, larger MF, more
visible after 30 min of adsorption (Figure 3D), clearly adopted a flattened conformation
at the solid surface, which seems to enhance their aggregation. This
behavior did not lead, however, to a total surface coverage as it
can be observed on the AFM height image (Figure 3D) and the Young modulus maps (Figure S2, Supporting Information)

fundamental (n = 1) and overtones (n = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) and the corresponding dissipation vs time

2.2 Catalytic
Activity in Solution
The
catalytic properties of MF were first investigated in the buffer solution
by means of the ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) method, as described
above. The activity was measured at 37 °C for different MF concentrations
over a range of 0.1–16 nM of estimated CYP concentration. A
typical evolution of the fluorescence vs time is given in Figure 5A. A calibration
curve was preliminarily drawn to relate fluorescence to resorufin
concentration (Figure 5A, inset). It is shown that the concentration of resorufin increased
progressively as a result of the CYP-catalyzed reaction (eq 4), independently of the amount of
MF introduced in the medium (Figure 5B). A fast increase was first observed corresponding
to the initial activity of enzymes (linear portion of the curve).
The slope of resorufin production decreased then as a function of
time, indicating a decrease of the reaction kinetics (eq 4), to reach a plateau after about
30–40 min. This trend is due to the mechanism of autoinactivation
of enzymes. Different trends were observed for CYP from human liver
microsomes or skin cell microsomes prepared from human primary keratinocytes
(Figure S3, Supporting Information). For
MF, the initial activity was determined by applying a linear fit and
expressed as resorufin concentration produced per min. The metabolism
rate–substrate concentration relationship of MF used in the
present study was satisfactorily consistent with the classical Michaelis–Menten
model (Figure S4, Supporting Information).
The dependence of the catalytic activity on the enzyme concentration
revealed a nonlinear relationship over the studied CYP concentration
range (Figure 5C).
However, at lower concentrations, a linear relationship was clearly
observed (Figure 5C,
inset), indicating that the substrate is in saturating amount in these
conditions.

activity (initial velocity) and the amount of CYP present in the solution

2.3 Layer-by-Layer
Assembly
The sequential
LbL assembly of (poly-l-lysine (PLL)/MF)n and (poly-l-ornithine (PLO)/MF)n multilayers on a flat substrate (where n represents
the number of adsorbed bilayers) was monitored in situ, in the hydrated
state, using QCM-D. The polycation used was either PLL or PLO. These
polyelectrolytes differ only slightly by their chemical functions
(lysine vs ornithine), whereas their charge densities are similar.
MF were incorporated as a polyanion because they exhibit an overall
negatively charged surface in PBS based on EPM measurements (Table 1). The shifts of frequency
and dissipation due to the alternated adsorption of PLL, or PLO, and
MF were recorded (Figure 6A,B). The polycation was first adsorbed on the negatively
charged surface of the SiO2-coated quartz crystal without
any additional anchoring layer. A shift of the resonant frequency
was recorded for each added layer corresponding to the adsorption
of the polycation and MF. Δf and dissipation
due to the adsorption of MF were appreciably higher than those observed
for PLL or PLO. The high dissipation observed after the adsorption
of MF indicates that the added mass acts as a soft and viscoelastic
adlayer. Dissipation values obtained with MF are appreciably higher
compared to those with globular proteins16 or even other proteins forming meshwork-like assemblies.55,56 The increase of dissipation was more pronounced with increasing
the number of bilayers n. It is also shown that the
addition of the polycation did not induce any noticeable decrease
of the dissipation, suggesting that no contraction of the film occurred
during the multilayer’s construction. The evolution of Δf as a function of the number of bilayers provides a more
direct evidence regarding the construction of PLL/MF and PLO/MF multilayers,
indicating that the LbL self-assembly did not change whether PLL or
PLO was used as a polycation (Figure 6C). It is worth noting that upon the build-up of 4
bilayers, the response of the sensor could no longer be monitored
in an efficient way at all of the overtones. This is probably because
the film became too thick and extensively hydrated. The above observations
are thus a direct proof of the involvement of MF as a polyanion for
LbL assembly in the chosen conditions.

frequency changes in the 5th overtone
and the corresponding dissipation changes during the build-up of (A)
(PLL/MF)n and (B) (PLO/MF)n multilayers in PBS (“R” indicates
the rinsing step with PBS). (C) Evolution of the frequency shift,
taken at the 5th overtone, as a function of the number of bilayers, n, upon the build-up of (PLL/MF)n and (B) (PLO/MF)n (as indicated).

AFM images revealed a clear evolution
of the surface morphology
as a result of the LbL self-assembly of (PLL/MF)n multilayers with n = 1, 3, and 5 bilayers
(Figure 7). After the
deposition of 1 bilayer, the surface showed the presence of isolated
particles attributable to MF (Figure 7A), similarly to those observed on the glass surface
(Figure 3A,D). The
typical cross section revealed that particles were not homogeneous
in size; many of them were below a height of 5 nm, and some reached
30 nm. After the deposition of 3 bilayers, the density of particles
and their size clearly increased, a great proportion of particles
exceeding a height of 100 nm (Figure 7B). However, in this situation, AFM images showed a
packing of particles in close contact with each other. Accordingly,
the real particle height could not be evaluated reliably because the
tip was too large to penetrate into the interstices between particles
(cross section in Figure 7B). The surface roughness, Rrms (computed from 10 μm × 10 μm AFM height images),
strikingly increased from 6 ± 0.8 to 44 ± 3.1 nm when the
number of deposited bilayers n increased from 1 to
3. The surface roughness also increased after the deposition of 5
bilayers (Rrms = 61 ± 3.7 nm) due
to the presence of larger particle aggregates (Figure 7C).

PBS buffer solution

(A) n = 1; (B) n = 3, and (C) n = 5. Cross sections were taken at the location indicated
by the white broken lines on the images (scale bars = 2 μm).

2.4 Catalytic
Properties of (PLL/MF)n Multilayers
The catalytic properties of
MF embedded in the multilayered film showed that CYP maintained a
significant activity in the adsorbed state, independently of the number
of bilayers (n = 1, 3, or 5). Typical evolution of
the resorufin production as a function of time is given in Figure 8A, showing a profile
similar to that obtained with free MF in solution (Figure 5B). A linear portion is clearly
observed up to about 30 min, corresponding to the initial activity,
and a plateau is reached after about 50 min (Figure 8A). Importantly, in situations with practical
relevance (e.g., screening tests in bioreactors), the ability of embedded
MF to remain active after repeated uses is the main standard. This
is what is called the operational stability. In the present study,
three successive use cycles were carried out on each sample during
30 min at 37 °C and with intervals of 1 h. The period of 30 min
of activity was chosen based on the trend observed in Figure 8A, to avoid the autoinactivation
of enzymes. Results showed that a significant decrease of the catalytic
activity occurred upon repeated uses, independently of the number
of bilayers n (Figure 8B). After 1 use, the (PLL/MF)1 sample showed
the most extensive deactivation (residual activity ∼10% of
the initial value), followed by the (PLL/MF)3 sample (residual
activity ∼16% of the initial value). Interestingly, the activity
was more preserved upon successive uses with increasing the number
of bilayers (residual activity ∼85% of the initial value after
1 use for the (PLL/MF)5 sample). These results indicate
that the operational stability is enhanced when increasing −Δf (Figure S5, Supporting Information),
which is reflecting the adsorbed amount of MF. It seems that the loss
of activity upon successive uses was not due to a possible desorption
of MF. Indeed, the supernatant did not show any significant activity
(not shown).

EROD essay

for the eye. (B) Operational stability of (PLL/MF)n multilayers (residual activity expressed in percentage
of the initial enzymatic activity): n = 1 (green
solid box); n = 3 (blue tilted square, solid); and n = 5 (orange triangle up, solid); error bars correspond
to the standard deviations of three independent experiments.

These observations clearly show
that MF may be immobilized through
the sequential LbL assembly while preserving their catalytic properties.
Increasing the number of bilayers, n, leads to an
extensive aggregation of MF, which seems to be mediated by the presence
of the polycation, as depicted in Figure 9. It appears that the increase of the amount
of adsorbed MF, resulting in their extensive aggregation, leads to
a better preservation of their operational stability. The formation
of aggregates may insure a better proximity of CYP and CPR enzymes.
Thus, evidencing this mechanism would be an original result, and the
question clearly deserves further investigation.

charged polyelectrolyte (PLL) and negatively charged MF and showing

polycation and (C) the subsequent adsorption of MF. For the sake of
clarity, MF are represented as monodisperse spheroid-shaped particles.

3 Conclusions
The successful design of multilayered films incorporating nanosized
bacterial membrane fractions (MF), which overexpress cytochrome P450
(CYP) and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), was reported. In solution,
MF exhibited a large particle size distribution with a mean hydrodynamic
diameter around 200 nm. Time-resolved DLS measurements showed that
the aggregation of MF did not occur independently of their concentration
in solution. Once adsorbed on the solid surface, MF mostly adopted
a flattened conformation with a low tendency to aggregate. In situ
QCM-D monitoring revealed the ability of MF to be incorporated in
a sequential LbL assembly using PLL or PLO as a polycation. In this
case, MF showed an extensive tendency to aggregate within the multilayered
films that became more noticeable when increasing the number of bilayers.

Enzyme assays revealed that MF preserved their CYP1A2 catalytic
properties in the multilayered films. More importantly, it was shown
that the ability of embedded MF to remain active after repeated uses,
i.e., operational stability, increased markedly with increasing the
number of bilayers. This behavior may be associated with the enhancement
of MF aggregation leading to a better preservation of their enzymatic
activities.

The strategy described in this article provides
a practical way
for the immobilization of enzymes from CYP family while preserving
their catalytic properties. Indeed, owing to the versatility of LbL
assembly, the incorporation of MF overexpressing CYP and CPR in multilayered
films may easily include various enzymes from the CYP family. This
is particularly important for the design of biomimetic bioreactor
to assess xenobiotic metabolism with the aim to provide a reliable
evaluation of the potential toxic effects due to xenobiotic absorption.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Membrane Fractions (MF)
and Polyelectrolytes
Poly-l-lysine (PLL, Mw 30–70
kDa) and poly-l-ornithine (PLO, Mw 30–70 kDa) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (France). Polyelectrolyte
solutions were prepared in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffer saline
(PBS, pH 7.4, Thermo-Fisher, France) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.
Membrane fractions (MF) overexpressing a human recombinant cytochrome
P450 (CYP) were obtained from Cypex (England). CYP1A2 was individually
coexpressed with human NADPH–cytochrome P450 reductase in E. coli following the procedure described elsewhere.44 Then, a cell fractionation method was used to
allow the purification of membrane fractions with highly enriched
recombinant enzymes. MF were provided in a storage buffer (50 mM Tris-acetate,
pH 7.6; 250 mM sucrose; 0.25 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) at
an estimated CYP concentration of 1 mM and a total protein concentration
of 10 mg/mL. Stock solutions were stored at −80 °C. MF
were diluted in PBS at pH 7.4 for the different experiments and used
immediately. All MF concentrations are given in estimated CYP concentration.

4.2 Layer-by-Layer Assembly
The substrates
used were disks of cover glasses (of 10 mm diameter, VWR, France),
cleaned prior to use in a piranha solution: H2SO4 (98%)/H2O2 (27%) 1:1 v/v. (Caution! piranha solutions react violently with organic materials and should
not be stored in closed containers). The build-up of the (PLL/MF)n and (PLO/MF)n multilayer
films was performed as follows: without the adsorption of an anchoring
layer, the substrate was alternately immersed in PLL, or PLO, and
MF solutions. The dipping time was fixed at 15 min for polyelectrolyte
solutions and 30 min for MF. After each dipping step, the samples
were rinsed in three different baths (2 min each) of the buffer solution
used for LbL assembly.

4.3 DLS
Dynamic light
scattering (DLS)
measurements were performed using a commercial instrument (Malvern
Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments Ltd, U.K.) equipped with a
He–Ne laser at 633 nm. Experiments were performed in the static
mode on MF dilution (20 nM, PBS) at 22 °C in a polystyrene cuvette.
In this mode, the device monitors the fluctuation of the intensity
of scattered light from the particles at 90° angle. The raw data
were processed using Zetasizer software that gives access to a size
distribution histogram and average hydrodynamic diameter (dH). The value of dH was obtained from the Stokes–Einstein equation 2  where kB is Boltzmann’s
constant, T is the absolute temperature (K), η
is the solution viscosity (mPa s), and D is the diffusion
coefficient of the objects (m2/s). The results are presented
as the mean and standard deviation of five replicates.

4.4 EPM
Electrophoretic mobility (EPM)
measurements were carried out using Malvern Zetasizer nano ZS with
disposable polystyrene cuvettes (DTS1061, Malvern Instruments Ltd,
U.K.) in PBS at 22 °C. The performance of the instrument was
systematically verified (every six samples) using a ζ-potential
standard solution (Malvern, DTS1232). ζ-potential was calculated
using the Henry law and the Smoluchowski approximation 3  where μ
is the electrophoretic mobility, a is the particle
radius, and ε is the dielectric
permittivity. f(κa) is Henry’s
function, which depends on the thickness of the double layer, κ–1, that acts to screen the electrostatic interactions
around the particle. According to the Smoluchowski approximation,
for thin double layer, i.e., κa ≫ 1, f(κa) → 3/2. The results are
presented as the mean and standard deviation of five replicates.

4.5 IR Analyses
Attenuated total reflection
infrared (ATR-IR) analyses were performed on solutions of MF prepared
in PBS buffer at a concentration of 20 nM. One milliliter of solution
was deposited on the ATR ZnSe crystal, and spectra were obtained by
the sum of 256 scans at 8 cm–1 resolution using
a pure solution of PBS as a reference. All analyses were performed
at room temperature using a Nicolet 5700 Fourier transform infrared
spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector.

4.6 AFM
AFM images were recorded using
a commercial AFM (Nanoscope VIII MultiMode AFM, Bruker Nano Inc.,
Nano Surfaces Division, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a 150 μm
× 150 μm × 5 μm scanner (J-scanner). The glass
substrates were fixed on a steel sample puck using a small piece of
adhesive tape. Images were recorded in PBS buffer at room temperature
(∼22 °C) using the peak force tapping mode.57 For this purpose, a quartz fluid cell was used.
The mounted samples were immediately transferred into the AFM liquid
cell while avoiding dewetting. Oxide-sharpened microfabricated Si3N4 cantilevers were used (SNL-10, Bruker Nano Inc.,
Nano Surfaces Division, Santa Barbara, CA). The spring constants of
the cantilevers were measured using the thermal noise method, yielding
values around 0.2 N/m. The curvature radius of silicon nitride tips
was about 12 nm (manufacturer specifications). The deflection sensitivity
was calibrated by recording the response of the cantilever on a bare
glass substrate (cleaned as described above), considered as an infinitely
stiff surface. All topographic images shown in this article were flattened
using a third-order polynomial to correct surface tilt and eliminate
bow effects.

4.7 QCM-D
The build-up
of the multilayered
film containing MF was monitored in situ by quartz crystal microbalance
with dissipation monitoring. Measurements were performed with a Q-Sense
E4 system (Biolin Scientific, Sweden) at a temperature of 22.0 ±
0.1 °C. The crystal used was a thin AT-cut quartz coated with
a thin SiO2 film (thickness ∼50 nm) provided by
Q-Sense. It was used after a classical cleaning with an anionic detergent
(SDS) and a subsequent UV–ozone treatment. Oscillations of
the crystal at the resonant frequency (5 MHz) or at one of its overtones
(15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65 MHz) were obtained when applying ac voltage.
The variations of the resonance frequency (Δf) and of dissipation (D) were monitored upon adsorption.
Solutions were injected into the measurement cell using a peristaltic
pump (Ismatec IPC-N 4) at a flow rate of 30 μL/min. Prior to
the multilayer build-up, PBS solution was injected to establish the
baseline. The construction of (PLL/MF)n or (PLO/MF)n multilayers was performed
as follows: first, PLL, or PLO, solution (1 mg/mL, PBS) was brought
into the measurement cell over 15 min. Subsequently, rinsing was performed
for 10 min using PBS. A MF solution (20 nM, PBS) was then injected
for 30 min following by a rinsing step. This procedure was repeated
until the desired number of bilayers was reached.

4.8 Enzyme Assay
The catalytic activity
of MF was evaluated by determining the CYP1A2 activity following the
so-called ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) protocol. The reaction
consists in the oxidation of 7-ethoxyresorufin yielding resorufin
and uses NADPH as a cofactor according to 4  The resorufin concentration was determined
by fluorescence measurements at the following wavelengths: λex = 560 nm and λem = 590 nm; the other reagents
and products do not interfere at these wavelengths. A calibration
curve was preliminarily established to relate the fluorescence at
590 nm to resorufin concentration. For free MF, solutions with different
concentrations of MF were prepared by dilution from stock solution
(1 mM). Catalytic activity measurements were carried out in PBS at
37 °C in the presence of 7-ethoxyresorufin (0.3 μM) and
NADPH (1 mM). For this purpose, 200 μL of reagents (MF, 7-ethoxyresorufin,
and NADPH) was introduced in a Corning 96-well black plate (Fisher
Scientific), which was placed in the fluorescence spectrometer (Fluostar
Optima, BMG Labtech, Germany). The fluorescence was measured every
30 s during 90 min. For immobilized MF, glass substrates coated with
PLL/MF multilayers were incubated in a PBS solution containing 7-ethoxyresorufin
and NADPH at the same concentrations indicated above. The fluorescence
was measured after the desired incubation time is reached (see the Supporting Information for more details).

4.9 Operational Stability
The reusability
of MF incorporated in the multilayered film was evaluated by measuring
the residual activities periodically at intervals of 30 min over a
period of 2 h 30 at 37 °C. Between two successive measurements,
samples were rinsed three times with PBS and reused immediately while
avoiding dewetting.
