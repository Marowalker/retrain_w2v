Arylated building
blocks or heterocycles are key to myriad applications,
including pharmaceutical drug discovery, materials sciences, and many
more. Herein, we have reported a mild and efficient strategy for generation
of aryl radicals by reacting appropriate aryl hydrazines with catalytic
iodine in open air. The aryl radicals were quenched by diversely substituted
1,4-napthoquinones present in the reaction mixture to afford diversely
substituted 2,3-napthoquinones in moderate to excellent yield. Control
experiments provided insights into the putative reaction mechanism.

Introduction
Aryl
radicals are highly reactive intermediates that play a crucial
role in diverse organic transformations, such as halogen-transfer
biaryl couplings, Sandmeyer reactions, addition to iminium ions, addition
to sulfur dioxide, and reactions with electron-deficient alkenes (Meerwein’s
arylation) and alkynes.1a−1k Due to their versatile utility, there have been quite a few synthetic
strategies to generate them. Among the most popular ones are through
diazonium salts and reactions of aryl bromides or iodides with tributyl
tin hydride and similar silicon hydrides.2a−2c They can also
be accessed through electrochemical reactions of aryl halides and
aryl hydrazines.3 Recently, Liu and co-workers
generated N,N′-diacylhydrazine
from (bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (PIFA) and N-acetylphenylhydrazide at a mild temperature.4 The phenyl radical (generated from the N-acetyl-N′-phenylhydrazide under oxygen in PIFA) plays a
crucial role in the transformation.4 Aryl
radicals are also generated by treating aryl hydrazines or aryl hydrazine
hydrochlorides with bases (such as pyridine, sodium hydroxide, and
potassium carbonate) in the presence of air.5a−5c These aryl
radicals are eventually quenched by various heteroaromatic or heterocycle
building blocks, such as pyrrolidine, pyridine, chromones, etc., to
provide the corresponding arylated species.5a−5c

By virtue
of their ubiquitous presence in nature and their role
as inhibitors in diverse biological systems, such as bacteria, fungi,
mammals, and parasites, naphthoquinones hold a niche position in synthetic
and medicinal chemistry.6b−6l They have displayed diverse activities as antibiotic, antifungal,
anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, apoptotic, and antithrombotic agents.6b−6f Aryl naphthoquinones form an exclusive class of natural products
and are found as building blocks in crisamicin A, microphyllaquinone,
conocurvone, etc.6g−6l

Despite their vast application as curative agents there are
not
very many efficient synthesis protocols of arylated naphthoquinones
(Scheme 1). A few general
strategies include metal-mediated oxidation and cycloaddition of aromatics
(Scheme 1a), base-mediated
arylation of naphthoquinones with aryldiazonium salts (Scheme 1b), and C–H bond activation
via transition-metal-catalyzed coupling reactions (Scheme 1c), and there have been a few
recent reports on hypervalent iodine as a reagent in this transformation
(Scheme 1d).7−10 Among these strategies, the transition-metal-catalyzed pathway has
been harnessed to a greater extent. For example, palladium-catalyzed
coupling of substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones with arenes (e.g., organostannanes,
halides, or boronic acids) afforded the desired 2- or 3-aryl naphthoquinones
in decent yield.9a−9h A close scrutiny of these strategies reveals myriad disadvantages
associated with them. For example, the strategies applied to date
have only provided a limited number of analogues (4–6) and
are extremely substrate-specific (Scheme 1a–d). The majority of these reactions
involved harsh conditions such as high temperature and application
of toxic metals, such as chromium, as reagents or heavy metal palladium
catalysts (Scheme 1b). Other than the transition-metal-catalyzed procedures, the remaining
strategies used a stoichiometric amount of reagents (Scheme 1a,b and d) for the arylation
of 1,4-naphthoquinones. Hence, development of a metal-free, environmentally
benign catalytic strategy will be of tremendous advantage.

Scheme 1 Existing
Strategies and Our Methodology
Iodine and organic iodides have evolved as efficient and robust
reagents or catalysts for the synthesis of organic compounds.11,12 One of the most remarkable developments in this field is the invention
of the catalytic activity of molecular iodine in the formation of
diverse C–C, C–O, and C–N bonds.13a−13c Interestingly, iodine- and transition-metal-catalyzed reactions
are similar and the fact that iodine is environmentally benign, robust,
and inexpensive provides an enormous scope for these reactions in
industry if properly harnessed.14

As a sustainable and viable contribution toward the generation
of aryl radicals, we began to think about harnessing molecular iodine
as an appropriate catalyst. From the literature survey, we realized
that in the presence of air, hydroiodic acid is oxidized to molecular
iodine. There is also a report by Joshi and co-workers published in
1957 that described the generation of aryl radicals by the treatment
of dinitrophenyl hydrazine with a stoichiometric quantity of iodine.15a,15b On the basis of these studies, we envisioned a reaction of 1,4-naphthaquinone
with phenyl hydrazine in air with catalytic molecular iodine. We anticipated
that the hydroiodic acid generated in the reaction will be oxidized
back to molecular iodine, thereby creating a catalytic cycle (Scheme 1j, “The concept”).
In that direction, herein, we demonstrate the generation of aryl radicals
from catalytic iodine in an open air vessel, with trifluoroethanol
(TFE) as a solvent at 40 °C. For the first time, molecular iodine
has been leveraged as a catalyst for this reaction. The aryl radicals
were subsequently quenched with substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones to
provide a diverse library of arylated 1,4-naphthoquinones in moderate
to excellent yield (Scheme 1j).

Results and Discussion
Optimization of Radical Generation and Subsequent
Quenching
with Substituted 1,4-Naphthoquinone
We began our optimization
studies with 2-(4-thioanisolyl)-1,4-naphthoquinone 1a and 4-methoxyphenyl hydrazine 2a as the model reaction
partners (Table 1).
Various solvents were explored with a variety of iodine-based compounds
as reagents or catalysts (Table 1, entries 1–21). The reaction temperature ranged
from room temperature (r.t.) to 70 °C. The first reaction with
a stoichiometric amount of phenyl iodonium diacetate (PIDA, 1 equiv)
under a nitrogen atmosphere at r.t. in acetonitrile (ACN) afforded
the desired compound 3a in 44% yield (Table 1, entry 1). A reaction with
(bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (PIFA) (1 equiv) afforded 3a in a similar yield of 42% (Table, entry 2). The same reactions
with PIDA and PIFA in the presence of oxygen provided 3a in slightly better yield (Table 1, entries 3 and 4). Reactions with 1 equiv of tetrabutylammonium
iodide (TBAI) (in ACN/H2O = 1:3 solvent system) and molecular
iodine (I2) (with ACN as solvent) drastically improved
the yield to ∼75% (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). All of these aforementioned reactions
occurred at r.t. To evaluate the catalytic scope of TBAI, next it
was used in 0.1 equiv in the presence of 0.2 equiv of pyridine in
1:3 ACN/H2O under an oxygen atmosphere at r.t. and at 70
°C (Table 1, entries
7 and 8). The reaction at 70 °C yields nearly 80% of 3a (Table 1, entry 8).
The reactions with only 0.5 equiv of TBAI (Table 1, entry 9) or with 0.5 equiv of pyridine
(Table 1, entry 10)
provided 18–21% of 3a. This emphasizes the combined
importance of both TBAI and pyridine in the reaction. It was interesting
to explore the effect of catalytic molecular iodine on the reaction.
Accordingly, reactions were conducted with 0.3 equiv of molecular
iodine in ACN at 40 °C in the presence of 0.3 equiv of pyridine
(Table 1, entry 11)
and 1 equiv of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Table 1, entry 12) to afford 3a in nearly similar yield to that in entry 8. The average
reaction time for all of these reactions ranged between 16 and 20
h. To seek an environmentally more conducive reaction condition, the
molecular-iodine-catalyzed reactions were next conducted under base-free
conditions in open air in various solvents (Table 1, entries 13–19). To our utmost satisfaction,
among these reactions, the reaction in 2,2,2-trifluorethanol (TFE)
provided 3a in the best yield of 91% (Table 1, entry 16). This result is
extremely significant as, in sustainable chemistry, TFE is an archetypal
solvent due to its strong ability for hydrogen-bond donation, high
ionizing ability, and environmentally friendly characteristics. It
is noteworthy that the reaction in methanol was more rapid than that
in TFE (12 vs 16 h); however, it generated the biphenyl byproduct
in substantial quantities that rendered it less efficient (Table 1, entry 15). Reducing
the equivalents of iodine to 0.1 and 0.2 equiv slowed the reactions
(Table 1, entries 20
and 21). They took nearly 40 h to complete. Hence, the optimized protocol
involved the reaction of 0.3 equiv of iodine, 1 equiv of 1a, and 2a in the presence of TFE under open air at 40
°C to afford the desired arylated 1,4-naphthoquinone 3a as the desired product (Table 1).

Exploring the
Generic Nature of the Reaction
With the
optimized conditions in hand, various 2- or 3-aryl-substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones
were generated that proved the robust nature of the protocol. In general,
a variety of substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones were chosen as substrates.
It is noteworthy that a few of the analogues synthesized via our strategy
are known, but most of them are new and the choice of analogues highlights
the simplicity and diversity of our strategy. The amino- and thio-substituted
naphthoquinone substrates, such as 2-(4-thioanisolyl) 1a, 2-thiophenyl 1b, 2-(4-fluorothiophenyl) 1c, 2-piperidinyl 1d, and 2-N-methyl-N-benzylamino 1e, were purposefully chosen
to demonstrate the robustness of our protocol amid the heteroaryl
functionalities. In addition, 2-bromo- and 2-methyl-substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones 1f and 1g, respectively, were also subjected
to the optimized reaction conditions with a variety of aryl hydrazines,
viz., 4-anisolyl hydrazine, phenyl hydrazine, and 3-fluorophenyl hydrazine 2a–c, to generate the desired products 3a–n in moderate to excellent yield (Scheme 2). In general, the
thioaryl-substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones, such as 1a–c, were the most amenable toward our optimized conditions.
The corresponding desired products 3a–g were obtained in 84–90% yield (Scheme 2). The next best substrates were the amino-substituted
naphthoquinones 1d and 1e. Accordingly,
products 3h–k were obtained in 66–75%
yield. The 2-bromo- and 2-methyl-substituted analogues 1f,g afforded the desired products 3l–n in 55–63% yield, respectively (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Library of Arylated Naphthoquinones
Next, the unsubstituted 1,4-naphthoquinone 1h was
subjected to the same reaction conditions with 4-anisolyl hydrazine,
phenyl hydrazine, and 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine, 2a,b, and d (Scheme 3). The reaction afforded the desired mono-
and disubstituted products 3o–s in
moderate yields of 23–82%. 2a and 2d provided the monoarylated products 3p and 3o, respectively, whereas 2b generated both the mono-
and diarylated compounds 3q and 3r, respectively,
with 3r being the major product (Scheme 2). 3p, when reacted under optimized
conditions with phenyl hydrazine 2b, afforded the diarylated
naphthoquinone derivative 3s in excellent yield (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Arylation of Unsubstituted
1,4-Naphthoquinone
Control Experiments
To understand the mechanism of
the reaction, a few control experiments were conducted. When 1a was reacted with 0.3 equiv of molecular iodine in TFE at
40 °C under air in the absence of phenyl hydrazine, it did not
generate 2-iodo-3-thioanisole-1,4-naphthoquinone 3a′, thereby indicating that no iodination of substrate 1a occurred in the presence of molecular iodine (Scheme 4a) and that molecular iodine specifically
reacted with aryl hydrazine to generate the aryl radicals. Next, the
reaction in deuterated methanol (CD3OD) provided the desired
product 3a along with the formation of deuterated-[D1]-1a and unreacted starting material 1a, thereby indicating the radical-mediated reversible C–H bond
formation at the quinonoid moiety of substrate 1a during
the reaction (Scheme 4b) (see Scheme S1 and Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information). However, stirring substrate 1a in CD3OD for 6 h did not provide the scrambled substrate.
When 1.5 equiv of (α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butyl nitrone (POBN), a spin-trap reagent that traps
organic radicals) was reacted with 2b in the presence
of 0.3 equiv of molecular iodine under air at 40 °C in TFE, the
desired phenyl-POBN adduct 4 was detected as the major
product in the mass spectra (Scheme 4c) (see Scheme/Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). This substantiated the generation
of aryl radicals in the presence of catalytic molecular iodine. To
understand the contribution of air, 1a and 2b were reacted under optimized reaction conditions, which resulted
in the formation of 3a in 16% yield. Hence, air is required
to sustain the catalytic cycle (Scheme 4d). Finally, when 1a was reacted with
phenyl diazonium tetrafluoroborate (Scheme 4e) in the presence of iodine, the desired
product 3a was obtained as indicated in the mass spectra
(Scheme 4e) (see Scheme S3 and the related procedure in the Supporting
Information).

Scheme 4 Control Experiments to Understand the Molecular-Iodine-Catalyzed
Generation of an Aryl Radical in Air and Its Subsequent Quenching
with Substituted 1,4-Naphthoquinone
Reaction Mechanism
Based on the control experiments,
the mechanism of arylation of substituted 1,4-naphthoquinone is proposed
in Scheme 5. Initially,
iodine reacts with phenyl hydrazine 2b to afford intermediate A. Dehydroiodination of A leads to the formation
of B, which further reacts with molecular iodine (regenerated
from the air oxidation of hydroiodic acid obtained during the formation
of B) to provide C. During the entire process,
the hydroiodic acid formed is converted to molecular iodine via air
oxidation, thereby the catalytic cycle of the reaction is sustained.15 Charge transfer of C provided the
diazonium salt D, which underwent a single electron transfer
(SET) and nitrogen release to afford the phenyl radical E and the iodine radical. Formation of the radical adduct F between E and 1a followed by a single
electron oxidation with iodine molecule leads to the formation of 3e via a radical cation (Scheme 5).

of Substituted 1,4-Napthoquinone
Conclusions
Herein, we have demonstrated a metal- and base-free
generation
of aryl radicals from aryl hydrazines via catalytic molecular iodine
under air at 40 °C in TFE. The reaction is reproducible and consistent
with a variety of aryl hydrazines. This strategy is harnessed to arylate
substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones. Through this protocol, a library
of diversely substituted 2- or 3-arylated-1,4-naphthoquinones were
accessed in moderate to excellent yield. The putative mechanism depicted
in this report is the result of meticulously executed control experiments,
which indicated that the molecular iodine reduces to hydroiodic acid
during the reaction and gets oxidized back in the presence of air
to sustain the catalytic cycle, which, in turn, generates the aryl
radical from aryl hydrazine. Further application of this methodology
for arylating key organic building blocks is presently ongoing in
our lab.

Experimental Section
General
All reactions were carried
out under air as
specified. The reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC, silica gel 60 F254), using ultraviolet (UV) light
to visualize the course of the reaction. 1a–e were experimentally synthesized, whereas 1f–h and 2a–d were
procured from multiple commercial vendors. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with tetramethylsilane as an
internal standard at ambient temperature unless otherwise indicated
with Bruker 400 MHz instruments at 400 MHz for 1H NMR and
100 MHz for 13C NMR spectroscopy. Splitting patterns are
designated as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), and doublet of
doublet (dd). Splitting patterns that could not be interpreted or
easily visualized are designated as multiplet (m). Mass spectrometry
analysis was done with a 6540 UHD Accurate-Mass QTOF liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) system (Agilent Technologies) equipped
with an Agilent 1290 LC system procured by the Department of Chemistry,
School of Natural Sciences, Shiv Nadar University, Uttar Pradesh 201314,
India.
