Imaging nanometer-
or molecule-scale topography has been achieved
by dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM) when a solid object of interest
is damaged by vacuum exposure or electron irradiation. Imaging in
a liquid offers a means to remove contaminations from the surface
scanned using the microscope tip when the object is soluble to the
surrounding liquid, typically water. In the present study, we attempted
to take topographic images of crystalline sucrose. A problem arose
due to the high solubility of this compound to water. Cantilever oscillation
could not be excited in the saturated, viscous aqueous solution. By
using n-hexanol instead of water, the solubility
in the solvent and thus viscosity of the solution were reduced sufficiently
to excite cantilever oscillation. Single-height steps and sucrose
molecules were recognized in the images and thereby recorded on the
(001)-oriented facets of sucrose crystals. Furthermore, two-dimensional
distribution of liquid-induced force pushing or pulling the tip was
mapped on planes perpendicular to the hexanol–sucrose interface.
Observed uneven force distributions indicated liquid hexanol structured
on the corrugated surface of sucrose. The viscosity tuning demonstrated
here, which is not limited to hexanol instead of water, extends the
range of liquid–solid interfaces to be probed by dynamic AFM.

1 Introduction
Structure
determination of solid surfaces is a fundamental task
in chemistry and physics at interfaces. Electron microscopy provides
a vital tool to visualize nanometer- and atom-scale architectures
of materials. Low-energy electron diffraction is feasible to determine
surface atom coordinates. However, organic compounds are easily damaged
by exposing them to a vacuum or irradiating them with electrons. Crystal
truncation rod analysis of X-ray diffraction offers a structure determination
free from electron irradiation,1 although
a synchrotron facility is required to provide X-rays of sufficient
intensity. In laboratories, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used
for visualizing nanometer-scale and even molecule-scale topography
of organic materials.

It is required in AFM imaging to maintain
an object of interest
with no contamination beneath the scanning tip. Immersion in a liquid
is a way to shield the object from the air, the major source of possible
contaminations. The imaging liquid plays a further role when the object
is soluble to the liquid. Even if the surface is contaminated prior
to immersion, the contaminated layers are spontaneously removed. By
applying this simple and efficient means, molecule- or atom-scale
imaging of 4-nitroaniline,2,3 CaCO3,4−10 MgCO3,11 and alkali halides12−14 has been achieved in aqueous solutions. Crystalline rubrene has
also been imaged in an ionic liquid.15 In
the present study, we apply this method to image crystalline sucrose
(C12H22O11). A problem arises due
to its high solubility in water, 67 wt % at 293 K.16 Cantilever oscillation cannot be excited in the saturated,
viscous solution of sucrose. In unsaturated solutions, sucrose crystals
rapidly dissolve, which makes imaging scans difficult. By using aliphatic
alcohols (n-hexanol, n-butanol,
and n-octanol) instead of water, the solubility and
viscosity of the liquid are reduced to achieve imaging with a molecule-scale
resolution. Two-dimensional distribution of liquid-induced force pushing
or pulling the tip has been further mapped on planes perpendicular
to the hexanol–sucrose interface. Observed uneven force distributions
evidenced liquid hexanol structured on the corrugated surface of sucrose.
The imaging liquid should be less viscous than water when saturated
with sucrose, harmless to an operator since our liquid cell is open
to the laboratory air, and inert on metals and adhesives of the cantilever
assembly. The alcohols satisfy these requirements.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Sucrose Crystals
A saturated aqueous
solution of sucrose (Wako, guaranteed reagent) was prepared at 350
K and cooled to room temperature. Centimeter-sized crystals terminated
with smooth facets appeared in the cooled solution, as shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. The
crystallographic indices of major facets were identified to be (001),
(101), or (011) by comparing the crystal shapes to those reported
in an earlier study.17 The authors focused
on the (001) facets, which were the most developed and hence had the
most stable truncation on crystalline sucrose. Facets of this orientation
were identified by visual inspection and then checked by X-ray diffraction.
Peaks assignable to (001), (002), and (003) diffraction were recognized,
as shown in Figure S2, to evidence the
proper orientation of the visually identified facets. The (001) plane
distance was deduced to 1.06 nm, in accordance with the reported length.
A wafer exposing two (001) facets at the top and bottom was prepared
by cleaving a crystal using a scalpel and set on a fluorocarbon polymer
plate designed for AFM imaging in a liquid.18

2.2 AFM Imaging
An SPM-8100FM (Shimadzu)
microscope in development was operated at room temperature (RT). A
droplet of the imaging liquid, n-hexanol (Wako, 97.0+%),
was placed on a cleaved sucrose wafer, and the cantilever assembly
was placed on the top. A piezo actuator oscillated a silicon cantilever
(BudgetSensors, Tap300Al-G). The typical spectrum of thermally excited
cantilever oscillation is shown in Figure 1. The quality factor of oscillation resonance
was deduced to 3.4 by fitting the spectrum with the nominal spring
constant of the cantilevers, 40 N m–1. Figure S3 shows the oscillation spectra in n-butanol (Wako, 99.0+%) and n-octanol
(Wako, 98.0+%) with quality factors of 3.9 and 2.6 in butanol and
octanol, respectively. One common cantilever was used while observing
the three spectra shown in Figure 1 and Figure S3.

Figure 1 Typical spectrum
of thermally excited cantilever oscillation in n-hexanol.

Let the authors note the efficiency of cantilever
excitation in
pure hexanol. The excitation voltage applied on the piezo actuator
was larger by 2.4 times than that required in pure water to yield
common amplitude of resonance oscillation, since the viscous response
of the liquids determined the excitation efficiency. In pure water,
the quality factor of oscillation resonance increased to 10. Hexanol,
which is more viscous than water, required larger amplitude of excitation
and led to a smaller quality factor. High-resolution imaging was still
possible in the circumstances, as will be described in the following
section. The viscosity of hexanol should be insensitive to the presence
of sucrose crystals in it. The solubility of sucrose in hexanol was
so low that the dissolution could not be visually recognized.

The piezoelectric scanner of the microscope was calibrated in lateral
coordinates by scanning a muscovite mica wafer in aqueous KCl solution
(0.1 mol l–1). A hexagonal structure with a repetition
length of 0.52 nm on mica was reproduced in the observed topography
with errors of 10% or less. The vertical coordinate was checked with
step heights on CaCO3 (104) wafers. Another microscope
(SPM-9700, Shimadzu) was operated with silicon cantilevers (Nanosensors,
PPP-NCHAuD) for imaging sucrose wafers in the air. Images observed
with the two microscopes were analyzed with WSxM software.19 The molecule assembly of sucrose crystals was
graphically presented in this paper using the VESTA program.20

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Sucrose Dissolution in Hexanol
Terraces
and steps were recognized on the cleaved (001) surfaces. Figure 2a shows the topographic
image observed in the air in the amplitude-modulation mode. In this
mode of imaging, the cantilever was oscillated at a fixed frequency
with constant excitation amplitude from the piezo actuator. The vertical
tip position was feedback-regulated to maintain the oscillation amplitude
at the free end of the cantilever constant. Round-shaped holes with
diameters of 50–100 nm were present over terraces with widths
of 0.5–1 μm. The terraces and steps gradually collapsed
in the air probably by absorbing moisture.

Figure 2 Terraces and steps on
the cleaved sucrose (001) surfaces. (a) Topographic
image scanned in the air. Image size, 5 μm square. Cantilever
excitation frequency, 281 kHz. Another cleaved wafer scanned in hexanol.
(b–e) Four consecutively observed images. Image size, 500 nm
square. Frequency-shift (Δf) set point, +36
Hz. Peak-to-peak amplitude of cantilever oscillation (A), 0.87 nm. (f) Cross section determined along the inserted line
in panel b.

Another cleaved wafer was immersed
in pristine hexanol and imaged
in the frequency-modulation mode. In this mode, the cantilever was
always resonantly oscillating with a constant oscillation amplitude
at the free end (A). The vertical tip position was
regulated to maintain the shift of resonance frequency (Δf) constant. A positive Δf indicated
repulsive tip–surface force. Four topographic images consecutively
observed at intervals of 10 min are shown in panels b–e of Figure 2. Two small particles,
probably insoluble contaminants, created marks on the surface. Terraces
that are 100–300 nm wide appeared with no round-shaped pits.
The terraces receded from left to right during 40 min of imaging.
The receding terraces indicated a low but finite sucrose solubility
in hexanol and made the sucrose surface clean spontaneously as desired.

The receding terraces were separated by regular-height steps. A
cross section determined along the line in panel b showed a regular
step height of 1.24 nm. The step height determined in the AFM topography
agrees with an accuracy of 14% with the unit cell length along the
[001] axis of crystalline sucrose, which was reported to be 1.09 nm
in an earlier study21 and confirmed in
our X-ray diffraction analysis. The deviations can be ascribed to
incomplete calibration of the z coordinate of the
scanner.

One unit cell contains two molecule layers perpendicular
to the
[001] axis, as illustrated in Figure 3a. Adjacent layers are separated by nearly
a half of the unit cell length. The observed step height regulated
to be the unit cell length indicated that one of the two terminations,
A or B, is more stable in hexanol than the other. Figure 3b shows the top view of the
two terminations with the six-membered ring lying parallel to the
surface and the five-membered ring nearly perpendicular. Sucrose molecules
are hydrogen-bonded with each other in crystals. Four hydrogen bonds
per molecule should break on the heavily corrugated termination A.
The weakly corrugated termination B with two broken hydrogen bonds
should be more stable than termination A.

and (b) top views with brown, red, and white spheres representing
carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms, respectively. An n-hexanol molecule in the all-trans conformation is depicted in panel
a to show its scale.

3.2 Topographic
Imaging with a Molecular Resolution
To resolve the fine features,
we magnified one of the terraces
and increased the frequency-shift set point. The increased set point
required an increased tip–surface repulsive force during the
feedback regulation, leading to a reduced tip–surface distance. Figure 4a presents the molecule-sized
features recognized in the raw image thereby obtained. Two-dimensionally
ordered protrusions were recognized with vertical corrugations of
0.03–0.04 nm, as shown in the cross sections in panels b and
c. The size of the two-dimensional unit cell was 0.78 nm × 0.86
nm with corner angles of 90°. The length and angle of the unit
cell vectors agreed with those in theory, which are given in Figure 3b. The protrusions
are therefore assigned to individual sucrose molecules exposed on
the surface. In AFM imaging of molecule-sized features, the scanned
object sometimes drifts relative to the tip due to thermal expansion.
Leaving the microscope is an effective way to reduce drifts. Since
our imaging liquid was exposed to air, the low vapor pressure of hexanol
(0.06 kPa at 293 K)22 helped us to continuously
scan a sucrose wafer for more than 5 h. The unit cell dimensions were
determined free from drift corrections.

the (001) terrace. (a) Raw topographic image
observed in hexanol. Image size, 5 nm square. Δf, +231 Hz. A, 0.33 nm. (b) Cross sections determined
along A–B and C–D lines and then smoothed.

Water molecules adsorbed strongly on mica and CaCO37 to be recognized as atomic-scale protrusions
in topography determined with FM-AFM. Their adsorption sites are metal
cations exposed on the surface. Hexanol or water adsorbed on sucrose,
if any, should be bound through hydrogen bonds. It is less probable
that the hydrogen-bonded molecules were solidified as water on the
metal-containing compounds.

Imaging in n-butanol
and n-octanol
was further examined to test the feasibility of alcohols with short
or long alkyl chains. Typical images are shown in Figure S4. They are qualitatively similar to the image shown
in Figure 4. Butanol
presented a slightly better signal-to-noise ratio probably due to
its lower viscosity; whereas, the vapor pressure of this liquid (0.6
kPa at RT)22 is higher by one order of
magnitude than that of hexanol, and it has limited feasibility for
continuous scans. Octanol was more viscous than the other two alcohols
and showed a reduced quality factor of cantilever oscillation. n-Hexanol was hence the most feasible liquid among the three
alcohols examined.

3.3 Hexanol Liquid Structured
on the Sucrose Surface
Atomic force microscopy operating
in the frequency-modulation mode
provides a tool for detecting uneven density distribution of liquids.
The homogeneous density distribution of hexanol liquid is modified
by exposing it to the sucrose surface. Figure 5a shows the cross-sectional Δf map observed on a plane perpendicular to the sucrose surface.
The oscillating cantilever was scanned vertically from the bulk hexanol
to the surface. The frequency shift was simultaneously recorded as
a function of the vertical coordinate to obtain one Δf–distance curve at one lateral position. The vertical
scans were aborted when Δf reached a predetermined
threshold, +700 Hz when acquiring the map shown in Figure 5a, to prevent severe contact
with the surface. By repeating 256 vertical scans along the lateral
coordinate parallel to the [010] direction, the Δf map of the plane perpendicular to the surface was constructed.

Figure 5 Hexanol
liquid over sucrose (001). Cross-sectional Δf distribution determined on the plane perpendicular to
the surface and parallel to the [010] direction with 256 vertical
scans. (a) Picture of the aspect ratio of the lateral and vertical
scales tuned to be unity. A positive (or negative) Δf with a bright (or dark) color. (b) Checker-board-like,
layered, and bridge-like Δf maps reported in
earlier studies. (c) Δf–distance curves
obtained on the A–B and C–D lines. (d) Force–distance
curves converted from the Δf–distance
curves. A, 0.09 nm.

The observed Δf map is regarded as an approximate
force distribution on the plane. A repulsive tip–surface force
causes a positive frequency shift, while the relation between the
force and Δf is nonlinear.23 The brightest region at the bottom distribution represents
the boundary of liquid hexanol and crystalline sucrose. When the tip
reached that region, the repulsive force increased monotonically.
This is a sign of contact of the tip on the solid. The envelope of
the brightest region periodically corrugated along the lateral coordinate
to produce a saw-tooth-like wave. Maxima and minima of the wave appeared
alternately with a repetition length of 0.81 nm, reproducing the periodic
length observed in the topographic image (0.86 nm).

The amplitude
of the saw-tooth corrugation (Figure 5) was greater than that determined in the
topographic image (Figure 4). In the Δf mapping, the cantilever
approached the surface until Δf achieved +700
Hz with an oscillation amplitude of 0.09 nm. The topographic image
shown in Figure 4 was
determined with a Δf set point of +231 Hz and
cantilever oscillation amplitude of 0.33 nm. Though the oscillation
amplitudes were different, the authors expected that the tip was further
pushed into the interface in the Δf mapping
than in the topographic imaging. The saw-tooth corrugation reconstructed
in the Δf map (Figure 5) should hence present a more precise trace
of sucrose topography. Tip indentation in the sucrose surface was
excluded since scratched features, as a sign of indentation, have
not been observed in consecutive scans.

In liquid hexanol, bright
and dark patches were laterally and vertically
ordered to produce a checker-board-like pattern, as illustrated in
the left panel of Figure 5b. The checker-board-like pattern decayed in intensity with
increasing the distance from the surface to present two or possibly
three layers of bright patches. The lateral repetition length in the
patterned distribution matched the saw-tooth-like topography of the
surface. The identical repetition lengths indicate that the physical
corrugation and/or chemical composition on the surface induced the
uneven density distribution of hexanol liquid.

The quantitative
relation between the tip–surface force
and the local liquid density is not direct, though a simple scheme
for interpretation (solvent tip approximation) has been proposed.24,25 Here, the comparison of the Δf map at the
hexanol–sucrose (001) interface with the Δf maps observed on other liquid–solid interfaces has been made
in a qualitative manner. Smooth liquid layers were formed on atomically
flat surfaces of graphite26−29 and the CH3-terminated thiolate monolayer,30 as depicted in the middle panel of Figure 5b. Bridge-like forms
of the first water layer (the right panel of Figure 5b) were reported on flat and hydrophilic
materials, mica,31,32 and OH- and COOH-terminated thiolate
monolayers.33 Those features are different
from the lateral and vertical ordering of bright and dark patches
observed in the present study. Patches ordered in a similar symmetry
have been found in water on 4-nitroaniline,2,3 CaCO3,4−10 MgCO3,11 KBr,13 and NaCl.14 A common characteristic
of these solids including sucrose (001) is the physical corrugation
on their surfaces when compared with graphite, mica, and the thiolate
monolayers. 4-Nitroaniline presented a rough surface topography according
to the orientation of the surface molecules. The alkaline-earth metal
carbonates also provided corrugated topography with carbonate anions
protruding from the cleaved surface. The alkali metal cations and
halogen anions created physical corrugations on the alkali metal–halide
surfaces. We therefore suppose that physical corrugations, represented
by the saw-tooth-like envelope (Figure 5), played a major role in structuring hexanol on sucrose
(001).

Typical Δf–distance curves
are depicted
in Figure 5c. Four
curves neighboring along the vertical lines A–B or C–D
in panel a were picked up and averaged to make the curves in panel
c. The averaged Δf–distance curves were
then converted to force–distance curves shown in panel d, following
Sader and Jarvis.23 Two force maxima and
two or three minima were recognized in curve A–B, in addition
to the monotonic increase caused by the partial tip contact to the
surface. The two maxima were separated by 0.7 nm, and the separation
length should correspond to the distance of two neighboring liquid
layers. When liquid alkanes30 and oxygenated
alkanes28,29 are placed on flat surfaces, smoothly layered
structures were produced with a layer-to-layer distance of 0.6 nm.
This distance has been interpreted with the thickness of these chain-formed
compounds statistically in the all-trans conformation. The distance
observed in the present study is close to this length. On the other
hand, the distance from the oxygen atom to the carbon atom at the
other end is 0.75 nm along the molecular axis of all-trans hexanol,
as depicted in Figure 3a. Standing orientation with some inclination cannot be ruled out.
Hydrogen bonding with OH groups exposed on the sucrose surface would
make alcohol molecules stand up.

4 Conclusions
A sucrose (001) surface was cleaved in the air and imaged with
frequency-modulation AFM in n-hexanol, n-butanol, and n-octanol. The finite and limited
solubility of sucrose in the short-chain alcohols played a triple
role in imaging; the moisture-sensitive surface was shielded from
the air. Possible contaminations were spontaneously lifted off. Cantilever
oscillation was excited in the less viscous solution even saturated
with sucrose. Terraces separated by regular-height steps were thereby
imaged in hexanol. The regulated step height, 1.2 nm, suggested that
one of the two possible terminations of normal to the [001] axis is
stable. Sucrose molecules were recognized on the terraces with no
sign of surface reconstruction. The two-dimensional force distribution
was observed on planes perpendicular to the hexanol–sucrose
interface to show liquid hexanol structured on the physically corrugated
sucrose surfaces. The choice of imaging liquids demonstrated here,
which should not be limited to one particular solvent, helps to conduct
high-resolution imaging of other readily soluble materials.
