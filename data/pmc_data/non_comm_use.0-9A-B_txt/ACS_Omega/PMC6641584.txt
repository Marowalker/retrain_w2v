For uranium extraction from seawater, development of
new stable and reusable sorbents with high affinity and good selectivity
for U(VI) is required. Herein, a new phosphate-functionalized polyethylene
(denoted PO4/PE) was synthesized via a simple Ar-jet plasma
treatment of PE in concentrated H3PO4 and was
employed in U(VI) extraction from seawater. The prepared PO4/PE shows superior performance in the extraction of trace U(VI) from
seawater. The adsorption process followed the second-order kinetics
model and the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacity of PO4/PE for U(VI) reaches 173.8 mg/g at pH 8.2 and 298 K. PO4/PE can be effectively regenerated by 0.1 mol/L Na2CO3 and reused well even after eight cycles. Experimental
results offer a new approach for U(VI) uptake from seawater.

Introduction
The widely used fossil fuels (petroleum
and coal) are the main
source of environmental pollution and greenhouse effect. The serious
environmental impact and the limited reserves of fossil fuels have
stimulated the search for alternative energy sources. Nuclear energy
is widely considered as a good substitute for fossil fuels because of its unparalleled
energy density (about 2.7 million times that of coal in theory) and
low emission of CO2.1 The development
of nuclear energy leads to a significant increase in the demands for
uranium, which will be the basic material of nuclear plants in the
future. However, the natural resource of uranium is limited and recycling
of uranium from radioactive wastewater is difficult. The 4.5 billion
tons of U(VI) in the ocean can be considered as a sustainable and
environmentally friendly substitute of the uranium terrestrial supply to sustain the demands
of the nuclear power industry in the future.2−4 The use of traditional
adsorbents to recover U(VI) from seawater is very challenging because
the concentration of U(VI) in seawater is very low (3.3 mg/L) and
abundant competing ions (such as alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals,
and heavy metals) coexist in seawater. Thereby, the development of
adsorbents with a high affinity, excellent selective property, and
simple preparation process is critical.5 From the initial inorganic adsorbents to the most studied polyamidoxime
(PAO)-based adsorbents and to more recent metal–organic frameworks,
great efforts have been devoted to developing efficient adsorbents
for extracting U(VI) from seawater.

The properties of surface
functional groups on sorbent surfaces
determine its adsorption affinity and capacity. Among the various
functional groups, phosphate groups (−PO4) have
attracted increased attention and play an important role in actinide
separation because of their excellent stability, strong irradiation
resistance, and high complexation ability with actinide element ions
(such as Pu(IV), Am(III), and U(VI)).1,6−11 Over the past years, various −PO4-functionalized
adsorbents have been widely applied in U(VI) extraction from solution.1,8−19 However, −PO4-functionalized adsorbents are usually
synthesized by chemical modification1,11−15 and polymerization techniques with appropriate organic reagents.8−10,16−19 To date, the development of a
simple and efficient synthesis technique is important for the potential
application of −PO4-functionalized adsorbents for
U(VI) capture.

Herein, a new phosphate-functionalized polyethylene
(PO4/PE) was synthesized by a simple Ar-jet plasma treatment
of PE in
H3PO4 and employed for U(VI) capture. PE was
selected just because this is one of the most studied substrate materials
in uranium extraction from seawater.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
photomicrographs of PE, PO4/PE, and PO4/PE after regenerating eight times are shown in Figure 1. The surface of PE (Figure 1A,B) is smooth with many microgrooves along the fiber, whereas that of PO4/PE (Figure 1C,D)
is rough and covered with a thin layer. Meanwhile, no notable differences
of PE surface morphology before and after immersion in H3PO4 are observed. Thereby, the thin layer is solid evidence
for the successful induction of −PO4 on the surface
of PE. Meanwhile, the sizes of PO4/PE become larger as
compared to those of PE (Figure 1G), which can be ascribed to the penetration of water
molecules into the PE polymeric structure and hydrolysis of the modified
functional groups. After recycling eight times, PO4/PE
(Figure 1E,F) still
retained the stacking morphology as that of raw PO4/PE,
indicating excellent stability and good reusability of PO4/PE. Elemental
mapping images (Figure 1H) indicate that O, P, and U are homogeneously dispersed on the PO4/PE surface, which demonstrates the excellent adsorption capacity
of PO4/PE for U(VI).

The mechanical properties of PO4/PE
is an important
parameter for its real application in U(VI) extraction from seawater, which was studied at its break point (Figure 2A). The mechanical properties of substrates
are usually significantly reduced in traditional synthesis processes
(such as the γ-ray irradiation and electron-beam irradiation
techniques). Xing et al.20 reported that
the tensile strength of a PE fiber diminished significantly from 3.0
× 109 to 1.3 × 109 Pa after γ-irradiation
for 50 kGy. In our case, the tensile strengths are 1.64 × 109 and 1.63 × 109 Pa for PE and PO4/PE, respectively. It means that the side effect of the traditional
synthesis method is well-eliminated in this work. To evaluate the
effect of the introduction of −PO4 by plasma treatment
on the PE framework, PE and PO4/PE are characterized by
powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Figure 2B). The fairly similar XRD patterns of PE
and PO4/PE further demonstrate no significant structure
damages of PE after Ar-jet plasma treatment in H3PO4.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) P 2p (D), XPS C 1s (E), and
XPS O 1s spectra (F) of PE, PO4/PE, and U-laden PO4/PE.

The effect of the introduction
of −PO4 by plasma
treatment on the PE surface was also studied by the Raman spectroscopy
technique. As shown in Figure 2C, PE presents “fingerprint” Raman peaks of
C–C vibrations at ∼1061 (asymmetric vibrations) and
∼1128 cm–1 (symmetric vibrations) and of
−CH2– vibrations at ∼1293 (twisting
vibrations in all crystalline phases) and ∼1415 cm–1 (wagging vibrations in the
orthorhombic crystalline phase).21 According
to the relative intensity ratio of the peak at ∼1415 cm–1 to that at ∼1293 cm–1,22 the degree of orthorhombic crystallinity of
PE was decreased after the introduction of −PO4 by
plasma treatment. It suggests that parts of the C–C/C–H
bonds were broken, which react with H3PO4 to
form −PO4 groups on the PE surface. In the high-frequency
region, the peak intensity ratio of −CH2–
(∼2846 cm–1) to −CH3 (∼2880
cm–1) decreases after the Ar-jet plasma treatment
in H3PO4, which indicates that the formation
of −PO4 groups on the PE surface is mainly by breaking
C–H bonds in −CH2–.

To study
the existing form of −PO4 groups on
the PO4/PE surface and its U(VI) adsorption mechanism,
PE, PO4/PE, and U-laden PO4/PE were studied
by the XPS technique. The P 2p spectra (Figure 2D) of PO4/PE and U-laden PO4/PE are deconvoluted into three components (Table 1): −PO4, polyphosphate
(poly(−PO4) that contains P–O–P bonds),
and metaphosphates (P–O–U(VI), in this work) at 133.2
± 0.1, 133.9 ± 0.1, and 135.1 ± 0.1 eV, respectively.23−25 Besides −PO4, poly(−PO4) is
also an important component on the PO4/PE surface. After
U(VI) adsorption, U-laden PO4/PE also showed new peaks
centered at ∼135.1 eV, indicating the effective binding of
U(VI) on the surface of PO4/PE in the form of P–O–U(VI)
bonds. The decreased XPS P 2p peak intensity of U(VI)-laden PO4/PE can be explained by the broadening of the XPS P 2p spectrum
and the coverage of bound U(VI)
on the surface of U(VI)-laden PO4/PE. Meanwhile, parts
of poly(−PO4) would decompose into soluble −PO4 during the U(VI) adsorption process, which would dissolve
in the solution. The C 1s spectral (Figure 2E) intensities significantly decreased after
the Ar-jet plasma treatment in H3PO4 and deconvoluted
into five components (Table 2) at 283.4 ± 0.1, 284.9 ± 0.1, 286.2 ± 0.1,
287.3 ± 0.1, and 288.8 ± 0.1 eV, which can be assigned to
carbide carbon; C–C; and carbon atoms bound to one (C–OH
and C–O–P), two (C=O), and three (−COOH)
oxygen atoms, respectively.24 The carbide
C and graphite carbon (C–C) are the main species of carbon
on the PE and PO4/PE surfaces. The contents of carbide
carbon and C–OH decreased after the Ar-jet plasma treatment
in H3PO4, which indicates that the −PO4 groups on the PE surface are introduced mainly via the cleavage
of carbide C and C–OH. The O 1s spectra of PE and PO4/PE (Figure 2F) can
be deconvoluted into four components at 531.0 ± 0.1, 532.5 ±
0.1, 535.0 ± 0.1, and 537.5 ± 0.1 eV, which are related
to the double-bonded oxygen (C=O), single-bonded oxygen (C–O
and −O–P in −PO4), chemisorbed oxygen
and water, and −OH, respectively (Table 3).24 The double-
and single-bonded oxygen species as the main O components in PE and
PO4/PE significantly decreased and increased, respectively.
It confirms the successful introduction of −PO4 on
the PE surface. The increased content of chemisorbed O and −OH
in U-laden PO4/PE can be ascribed to the adsorbed U(VI),
which confirms the high adsorption capability of PO4/PE
for U(VI).

Adsorption
The
prepared PO4/PE shows excellent
performance in selective adsorption of U(VI) from seawater. As shown
in Figure 3A, the introduced
−PO4 groups increase the enrichment of U(VI) on
PO4/PE under experimental conditions. Moreover, the adsorption
of U(VI) on PE and on H3PO4-dispersed PE (data
are not shown) is similar under the experimental uncertainties. Thereby,
the enhanced U(VI) adsorption can be attributed to the strong complexation
of U(VI) and −PO4 groups26 on the PE surface. Meanwhile, the adsorption U(VI) on PE and on
PO4/PE increases with increasing pH and then slowly decreases
with a further increase in pH. It reveals that U(VI) adsorption on
the PO4/PE surface is fairly pH-dependent. The charges
of the U(VI) species in the solution are affected by solution pH.
Meanwhile, the available −PO4 groups gradually deprotonate
with increasing solution pH.27

It is well known that seawater is a very complex
matrix and alkali
metal ions (such as Na(I) and K(I)) and alkaline earth metal ions
(such as Ca(II) and Mg(II)) are the predominant cations in seawater.
To estimate the effect of ionic strength on PO4/PE adsorption
capability for U(VI), the effects of those cations were studied using concentrations
of 0.010–1.0 mol/L and are shown in Figure 3B. PO4/PE exhibits high selectivity
for U(VI) against Na(I) and K(I) because the adsorption of U(VI) just
slightly decreases with an increase in their concentrations. Ca(II)
and Mg(II) have a more significant negative effect than that of Na(I)
and K(I) on U(VI) adsorption, which can be explained by the complexation
reaction among U(VI), CO32–, and alkaline
earth metal ions in the solution.2,28−31 Many researchers found that these complexes determine the extraction
behavior of U(VI) in seawater because of the high concentrations of
Ca(II) and Mg(II).2,32 It is well known that many metal
ions, such as Cu(II), Al(III), Fe(III), and V(IV), coexist with U(VI)
in seawater and these metal ions result in serious interference in
U(VI) separation. Therefore, the selective extraction capability of
PO4/PE toward U(VI) was compared to that toward the coexisting
metal ions. The results in Figure 3C show that U(VI) adsorption on the surface of PO4/PE is significantly higher than that of other metal ions
under same experimental conditions, which reveals the high selectivity
of PO4/PE toward U(VI) in seawater in comparison to that
toward other metal ions, especially V(IV). A number of researchers1,33,34 reported a similar highly selective
retention behavior of U(VI) on −PO4-functionalized
adsorbents, and they explained it by the strong complexation of −PO4 groups with U(VI). Furthermore, the competition between U(VI)
and V(IV) is one of the most serious challenges for the commercial
application of most adsorbents in U(VI) recovery from seawater.3,4,35,36 Our results show that PO4/PE can tolerate V(IV) interference,
highlighting the potential application of PO4/PE in the
selective extraction of U(VI) from seawater.

The effect of reaction
time on the adsorption of U(VI) by PO4/PE was studied because
seawater temperature varies widely
with the position and season. As depicted in Figure 3D, the adsorption percent increases quickly
in the first 6 h and then maintains the level with the increasing
reaction time. To further investigate the adsorption kinetics, the
pseudo-first-order kinetic models (qt = qe × (1 – exp(−k1t)), where k1 (h–1) is the adsorption rate constant, qe (mg/g) and qt (mg/g)
are the equilibrium and experimental adsorption capabilities, respectively)
and pseudo-second-order kinetic models (qt = qe·t/(1/(K′·qe) + t), where K′ (g/(mg·h)) is the adsorption rate constant) are used to simulate the experimental
data. The related parameters are shown in Table 4. According to correlation parameters (R2), the pseudo-second-order kinetic model provides
a better description of adsorption data than the pseudo-first-order
kinetic model. It clearly reveals that U(VI) adsorption on PE and
PO4/PE can be considered as a chemisorption process through
complexation with −PO4 groups under experimental
conditions. Many researchers found that U(VI) adsorption on −PO4-functionalized adsorbents followed the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model.8,10,11,37−39 Das et al.40 also reported that the adsorption of U(VI) on
PAO adsorbents obeyed pseudo-first-order kinetics and pseudo-second-order
kinetics at high and low initial concentrations of U(VI), respectively.

The maximum adsorption capability of PO4/PE for U(VI)
was determined via adsorption isotherm. As depicted in Figure 3E, the adsorption isotherms
show an increase with an increase in the initial concentration of
U(VI) and reaction temperature. The commonly used Langmuir model (Cs = b × Csmax × Ce/(1 + b × Ce), where Csmax (mg/g) and b (L/mg) are
the maximum adsorption capability and the Langmuir constant, respectively)
and Freundlich model (Cs = K × Ce1/n, where K (mg/g) and 1/n are the
constants indicative of the adsorption capability and intensity, respectively)
are used to analyze the experimental data. The relative parameters
are depicted in Table 5. According to the R2 values, the adsorption
process followed the Langmuir model, which indicates that the adsorption
of U(VI) on PO4/PE surfaces is localized in a monolayer.
According to the analysis results, the maximum adsorption capacities
(Csmax) of PO4/PE for U(VI)
at pH 8.2 are ∼170.2, ∼173.8, and ∼176.7 mg/g
at 288, 298, and 308 K, respectively, which are comparable to those
of other adsorbents (Table 6), which highlighted the application of our method in preparing
PO4/PE for selectively extracting U(VI) from seawater.
The related distribution coefficient (Kd) and thermodynamic parameters are also calculated and are shown
in Figure 3F and Table 7, respectively. The
negative Gibbs free energy change (ΔG0), the positive value of entropy change (ΔS0), and the positive value of standard enthalpy change
(ΔH0) reveal that U(VI) adsorption
on the PO4/PE surface is an endothermic and spontaneous
process.

The regeneration–reusing property of PO4/PE was
studied to further estimate its potential application. Na2CO3 is selected as the eluting agent, and the results
are depicted in Figure 4A. The elution of U(VI) from the PO4/PE surface quickly
increases with increasing Na2CO3 concentrations
from 0.002 to 0.1 mol/L and then remains at this level. The result
demonstrates the effective regeneration of PO4/PE in a
0.1 mol/L Na2CO3 solution. Thereby, the 0.1
mol/L Na2CO3 solution is selected for the regeneration
of PO4/PE. The effect of recycling times on the adsorption
capability of PO4/PE for U(VI) was studied and is shown
in Figure 4B. The regenerated
PO4/PE still exhibits high adsorption capability for U(VI)
even after regenerating eight times under experimental conditions,
which reveals the excellent reusability property of PO4/PE in the extraction of U(VI) from seawater.

Because of the attractive adsorption capability
of PO4/PE for U(VI), the real application of PO4/PE in U(VI)
extraction from deionized and real waters was studied, and the results
are shown in Table 8. First, we studied the performance of PO4/PE in the restoration
of deionized water (m/V = 0.20 g/L,
pH = 8.2) in which 5–50 mg/L U(VI) was intentionally added.
PO4/PE can quantitatively extract mg/L levels of U(VI)
from the aqueous solution. Encouraged by the above results, we then
studied the adsorption capability of PO4/PE in extraction
of U(VI) from real water. The aqueous solution from Chaohu lake was
selected and μg/L level of U(VI) was intentionally added. PO4/PE still showed excellent adsorption efficiency for μg/L
levels of U(VI). Thereby, the real application of PO4/PE
in the extraction of U(VI) from seawater was performed and the seawater
from East China Sea was used. The reaction temperature, contact time,
PO4/PE mass, and seawater volume were 25 ± 1 °C,
24 h, 200 mg, and 100 mL, respectively. The adsorption efficiency
of ∼39% for 3.8 μg/L U(VI) in seawater reveals the excellent
adsorption efficiency of PO4/PE in real separation of trace
U(VI) from seawater.

Mg(II), 3.1 mg/L Cl–, 12 mg/L SO42–, and 141 mg/L HCO3–.
The pH values of the suspensions were kept at the initial value by
adding negligible amount of NaOH solutions.

b The main composition of seawater
was 9.8 g/L Na(I), 0.36 g/L K(I), 0.42 g/L Ca(II), 0.93 g/L Mg(II),
17 g/L Cl–, 2.1 g/L SO42–, and 0.12 g/L HCO3–. The pH values
of the suspensions were kept at the initial value by adding negligible
amount of NaOH solutions.

Conclusions
From the results of PO4/PE characterization and U(VI)
adsorption on PO4/PE under different experimental conditions,
the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) A PO4/PE adsorbent
with high adsorption capacity for U(VI) was synthesized by a simple
and efficient Ar-jet plasma treatment technique. (2) A plausible reaction
mechanism is proposed and confirmed based on microscopic and spectroscopic
characterization. (3) PO4/PE exhibits excellent adsorption
capability for U(VI) in seawater (maximum adsorption capacity of 173.8
mg/g at pH 8.2 and 298 K and regeneration–reuse property).
The results in this work highlight the application of PO4/PE as an adsorbent in the extraction of U(VI) from seawater.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of PO4/PE
The PE fiber (TYZ Safetex
FT-103) was purchased from Beijing Tongyizhong Advanced Material Company.
PO4/PE was synthesized by the Ar-jet plasma treatment of
PE in H3PO4. Briefly, 5.0 g of PE and 100 mL
of 85% H3PO4 were added into a 250 mL round-bottom
flask and treated by Ar-jet plasma (high-purity Ar) for 60 min at
room temperature and atmospheric pressure under continuous stirring.
The Ar-jet plasma conditions were as follows: Ar of 200 sccm, voltage
of 5000 V, and electrical current of 1.0 mA. The PE fibers floated
on the surface of 85% H3PO4 initially and were gradually dispersed
in the H3PO4 solution with the progress of Ar
plasma treatment. The obtained material was washed with Milli-Q water
after the Ar-jet plasma treatment and dried at 60 °C for 24 h.
To evaluate and compare the effects of Ar-jet plasma treatment, H3PO4-dispersed PE was also synthesized by the same
method. The diagram of the Ar-jet plasma apparatus used in this work
is shown in scheme 1.

Characterization
The physiochemical properties of PO4/PE were characterized
by SEM, element distribution mapping,
tensile strength and elongation measurement, powder XRD, Raman spectroscopy,
and XPS in detail. SEM images and element distribution mapping were
obtained by a field emission-SEM (JSM-6320F; JEOL). The tensile strengths
and elongation properties were measured on a tensile tester (MTS criterion
model 43-3041E). The powder XRD pattern was collected by XRD (Rigaku
D/max 2550) at ambient temperature. Raman spectroscopy analysis was
performed by a Raman spectrometer (LabRam HR). XPS spectroscopies
were performed by a surface microanalysis system (ESCALab220i-XL;
VG Scientific) equipped with an Al Kα (hλ
= 1486.6 eV) source at a chamber pressure of 3 × 10–9 mbar. The surface charging effects were corrected with the C 1s
peak at 284.4 eV as a reference.

U(VI) Adsorption on PO4/PE and on PE
To
evaluate the effect of −PO4 group functionalization
by the Ar-jet plasma treatment on the adsorption capability of PE
toward U(VI), U(VI) adsorption on PO4/PE and PE was studied
by the batch adsorption technique. After the adsorbent and salinity
(such as NaCl) were pre-equilibrated for 24 h, the U(VI) solution
(UO2CO3) and Milli-Q water were added to achieve
the desired components and the pHs of the suspensions were adjusted
by the corresponding acid and basic solutions. After shaking for 48
h, the supernatant was filtered by 0.45 μm membrane filters.
The final U(VI) concentrations (of mg/L and μg/L levels) in the supernatants
were measured on an Optima 2100 DV inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
atomic emission spectroscopy system (Perkin Elmer) and on an ICP mass
spectroscopy (ICP-MS, Thermo Scientific X-Series II) system, respectively.

Regeneration–Reuse of PO4/PE
Na2CO3 was selected for the regeneration of PO4/PE. About 25 mg of U-laden PO4/PE was regenerated
in 50 mL of Na2CO3 solution for 24 h followed
by rinsing with water and drying at 60 °C. Thus, regenerated
PO4/PE was obtained and reused in following experiments.
