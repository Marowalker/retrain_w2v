This work describes the conversion
of mechanical energy to electricity,
by periodically stretching rubber tubing and allowing it to relax.
The rubber surface shows periodic and reversible electrostatic potential
variations, in phase with the tubing length. The potential change
depends on the elastomer used: silicone loses charge when stretched
and becomes strongly negative when relaxed, whereas the stretched
natural rubber is positive, becoming negative when relaxed. Every
other elastomeric material that was tested also showed periodic potential
but followed different patterns. When the motion stops, the potential
on the resting samples decreases quickly to zero. The potential oscillation
amplitude decreases when the relative humidity decreases from 65 to
27%, but it is negligible when the rubber tubing is previously swollen
with water or paraffin oil. Elastomer charging patterns do not present
the well-known characteristics of piezo-, flexo-, or triboelectricity,
and they are discussed considering rubber rheology, wear, and surface
properties, including the possibility of surface piezoelectricity.
The following mechanism is suggested: rubber stretching provokes chemical
and morphology changes in its surface, followed by a change in the
surface concentration of H+ and OH– ions
adsorbed along with water. The possibility of the occurrence of similar
variations in other systems (both inert and biological) is discussed,
together with its implications for energy scavenging from the environment.

Introduction
This paper describes
a new finding on the electrostatic behavior
of elastomers: shortly, rubber tubing stretching followed by relaxation
provokes the appearance of transient excess charge that is more pronounced
under higher relative humidity (RH). This adds to other unexpected
recent findings on electrostatic phenomena1−3 that are leading
to a revision of widespread ideas4 on electrostatic
charging mechanisms, affecting many scientific areas and creating
new opportunities for energy production.5,6

The limitations
of current knowledge on electrostatic phenomena
have been revealed on different occasions,7,8 and
the search for better understanding led piezo- and triboelectricity9,10 to a distinguished position in current research on environmental
energy scavenging.11,12 On the other hand, the lack of
well-established knowledge on this matter is evidenced by the persistent
occurrence of serious industrial accidents owing to explosions and
fire initiated by electrostatic discharge on solids that are otherwise
rather stable. Widespread and seemingly safe solids, such as polyethylene
(PE) and wheat flour, are thus transformed into powerful explosives.13,14

Tribo- and piezoelectricity are common effects of mechanical
action
on materials that have been investigated considering their potential
use in energy scavenging.15,16 The two effects account
for the electrostatic potentials detected in most anthropic and natural
environments, often reaching many-thousand volts. They are thus the
basis of many types of nanotribogenerators17 that are now showing impressive performance.

Piezoelectricity
is observed in noncentrosymmetric crystals, but
the closely related flexoelectricity(18) can be observed in any kind of material under a strain
gradient. Flexoelectricity in polymers has been examined in a few
cases only,19 and there is a significant
disagreement among the reported flexoelectricity tensors, that led
the authors of a recent review18 to explicitly
exclude polymers from the tables, showing flexoelectric coefficients
for various materials. Giant flexoelectric coefficients were measured
in poly(vinylidene difluoride), leading the authors to state that
“In conclusion... the physical origin behind the flexoelectricity
in polymers might be more complicated than the one proposed for solid
crystalline dielectrics.”20

Another emerging topic is surface piezoelectricity(21) that may be observed when the solid
surface differs from the bulk solid, presenting a noncentrosymmetric
crystalline material. Its importance increases at the nanoscale, when
even nonpiezoelectric materials may act as piezoelectric.

The
electrical effects triggered by the mechanical action on rubbers
are related to many other research topics: polymer rheology, friction
and adhesion,22,23 wear,24 and lubrication25 that are often associated
with the mechanochemical reactions in the polymer bulk or surface
and the formation of triboplasma.26,27 This can trigger
other physical effects, such as triboluminescence28,29 and acoustic emission.30 Because these
are studied in different contexts and experimental conditions, the
correlation of the experimental results is hardly feasible.

The present authors made many previous incidental observations
of electrostatic charge on rubbery materials subjected to mechanical
efforts such as tension, compression, flection, and torsion, which
do not involve contact or friction with external surfaces. Very high
potential with half-life in the few-minutes range is then measured
near elastomers, different from thermoplastics that can store charge
for long periods, hours to many days.31

An intriguing result was recently reported on the electrostatic
charging of relaxed and strained latex rubber sheets contacted with
different materials32 [poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE), polyurethane, and stainless steel], finding great differences
in the amount of contact charging. These were tentatively assigned
to rubber surface modification or to a change in the mass transfer
pattern because of rubber stretching. Earlier, Dogadkin et al. had
shown the effect of electric charges formed during repeated deformations
on the fatigue resistance of vulcanized rubber.33 Thus, rubber electrostatic charging has specific features
that are not yet understood. Given the ubiquity of rubber materials
in anthropic environments, they probably make an important contribution
to our electrified environment but this has been detected indirectly,
for example, in triboluminescence experiments.27−29 It is remarkable
that the excellent book on Tribochemistry authored by Heinicke26 does not carry the keyword “rubber”
in its extensive index (13 pages) neither in its table of contents
(5 pages). Nevertheless, this book has a section on the Tribochemisty
of Polymers.

In this work, we show that cyclic rubber stretching
and relaxation
under the atmosphere provokes the appearance of large positive and/or
negative potential, depending on the material used and the RH. This
is an unprecedented finding that may have profound implications in
human safety and health.

Results
When rubber tubing is periodically
stretched and allowed to relax,
it shows a periodic change in the electrostatic potential, measured
by a Kelvin probe. The frequency of potential oscillations is the
same as the stretching frequency, and the typical plots of potential
versus time are presented in Figure 1, for natural rubber and silicone. While natural rubber
develops predominantly positive potential during periodic motion,
silicone rubber is negatively charged. The electrostatic potential
on natural rubber that is initially close to 0 V increases to positive
values when it is stretched and decreases to negative values when
it relaxes.

Figure 1 Electrostatic potential of (A) natural and (B) silicone rubber
under stretching–relaxation cycles. The Kelvin electrode recorded
the initial electrostatic potential, for 60 s. The stretching–relaxation
cycles followed for 180 s and thus ceased, leaving the material at
the starting position. Zooms from (A,B) are shown in the inset graphs.
(C,D) voltage vs distance for natural and silicone rubber, respectively.
Experiments were performed at 60% RH (see also Figure 9).

Silicone tubing equilibrated in the laboratory environment
until
it reached ca. −5 V does not change when stretched, but it
develops a significant negative charge when relaxed. Repeatedly stretching
silicone rubber produces a negative potential exceeding −3300
V that is the lower limit for the voltmeter used.

Electrostatic
potential changes with the length of the stretched
rubber during typical actuation cycles. The V versus d curves in Figure 1C,D reveal that the charge on the natural rubber changes continuously
during the whole cycle, whilst the potential of silicone surfaces
increases more pronouncedly under shorter extension. These results
are reproduced for lower amplitude and frequencies of actuation (Figure S1).

Repeated experiments with silicone
and natural rubber show that
the potential patterns are reproducible but with quantitative drifts.
This is observed in Figure 2, showing the potential patterns acquired for the same pieces
of tubing that were subjected to successive trains of short stretch–relax
cycles. Each train lasted for ca. 10 s followed by 60 s resting period,
during which natural rubber potential decreased slowly and reproducibly.
Similar observations could not be done on silicone because the potential
reached exceeds the measuring range of the Kelvin voltmeter.

Figure 2 Six consecutive
trains of stretching–relaxation cycles for
(A) natural and (B) silicone rubber. Insets are extracted from the
plots in (A,B), presented with an expanded time scale (x-axis). Experiments were performed at 60% RH.

There is only a small baseline drift, showing that low persistent
charging, if any, takes place concurrent with the fast reversible
processes. When the tubing is allowed to rest under laboratory conditions,
charge is dissipated and the potential reaches values close to zero,
minutes after stopping the mechanical oscillations.

The expressive
variations in potential are not correlated with
apparent physical changes in the elastomers, during cycling. The temperature
on the rubber surfaces increases by only 2–4 °C above
room values. Experiments performed in a dark room with a sensitive
camera set to long exposure time did not show any glow discharge or
spark, characteristic of triboluminescence.

The electrostatic
potential response during natural rubber cycling
is asymmetric. Figure 3 shows the result of alternating single stretching and relaxation
cycles with an amplitude of 6 cm. The tubing, initially at rest in
a relaxed state, is then subjected to a stretching half-cycle, at t = 27 s. The potential promptly responds to mechanical
action increasing in value, and then decreasing exponentially while
the rubber is kept in the stretched state. Once the potential reaches
zero, the rubber is allowed to relax back to the initial condition,
starting at t = 71 s. Again, the potential changes
quickly but toward negative values, and then decay back to V = 0 V. Potential decay after rubber relaxation is much
faster than the potential decay after stretching the rubber. The pattern
just described was observed reproducibly, under different samples
and humidity conditions, although it would occur at a much slower
rate for aged materials (b). Note that full charge dissipation takes
longer than the time required for stretching or relaxing the rubber
tubing.

Figure 3 Potential as a function of time during single stretching and relaxation
steps, obtained for (a) typical natural rubber and (b) natural rubber
that has been aged, by washing with ethanol and heating at 60°
during 1 h, five times. The elongation amplitude was 6 cm.

Some observations made during the experimental
work suggested that
the ambient humidity affects the experimental results. For this reason,
the whole apparatus was enclosed within a wooden frame lined with
a flexible poly(vinylchloride) film that was previously allowed to
dissipate charge, reaching an electrostatic potential lower than 10
V. RH variations were obtained by bubbling nitrogen gas through deionized
water and blending it with dry gas, to reach the desired values.

Figure 4 shows a
plot of the amplitude of potential variation during stretching as
a function of the RH for natural rubber. This shows that the charging
effect disappears, below 20% RH, when the variation observed is not
distinguishable from noise.

Figure 4 Amplitude of electrostatic potential oscillations
as a function
of RH for natural rubber with an elongation amplitude of 6 cm.

Elastomer charging is thus pronounced
above 20–30% RH, only.
However, it is not possible to do measurements above 80% RH to avoid
malfunctioning of the Kelvin electrode. Measurements were thus made
on a piece of tubing that was swollen by immerging it within water
for 48 h. This sample did not at all acquire charge (see Figure 5).

Figure 5 Electrostatic potential
recorded during stretching–relaxation
cycles for natural rubber exposed to controlled RH and changing stretching
frequency. (A) Experiment initiated under ambient 65% RH, followed
by a decrease in humidity to 27%, and then back to 65% RH. The fourth
trace was recorded for soaked natural rubber previously immersed in
water, for 48 h. (B) Effect of stretching frequency: initially single
manual cycles, followed by the standard 4 Hz stretching protocol and
then slowly decreased down to 0.2 Hz, back to 4 Hz and finishing with
manual cycles.

Figure 5 also shows
the effect of RH together with the effect of stretching frequency.
During the initial 300 s, individual stretching cycles at a very low
frequency (0.2 Hz) produced ±20 V potential jumps that quickly
relaxed to zero. The positive potential decay rate is slower than
the negative potential decay, as also observed in Figure 2. Voltage under 4 Hz stretching
reached 35 V. After 750 s, the oscillating frequency was gradually
decreased down to a minimum 0.2 Hz and the potential amplitudes also
decreased to values similar to those obtained in the initial run.
Finally, a sudden increase in the oscillating frequency up to 4 Hz
brings back higher potential variations. The last two recordings at
4 and 0.2 Hz allow an assessment of the reproducibility of the electrostatic
potential patterns observed for natural rubber.

There is also
an effect of the stretching amplitude on the potential
measured during periodic motion, and a set of data obtained for natural
rubber is in Figure S2 The highest electrostatic
potentials were measured under larger stretching amplitudes, and they
are significantly reduced for smaller stretching amplitudes. For example,
the experiments shown in Figures 1 and 2 for natural rubber were
performed at 10 cm amplitude, corresponding to 83% rubber elongation,
producing voltages in the −50 to +150 V range.

Under
17% elongation, lower electrostatic potential is measured,
in the −20 to +20 V range. Both higher stretching frequency
and higher elongation have a common feature: both provoke faster change
in the surface area of the rubber.

Experiments were also done
with common rubbery materials with different
shapes, and their results are given in Figure 6. Pieces of cloth and elastic bands were
subjected to periodic stretching cycles in a setup similar to that
employed in the main experiments. Experiments started with four cycles
of manual, low-frequency actuation, followed by 3 min of reciprocate
shaking at 4 Hz, and finally resting for 1 min. Different materials
show different charging patterns but with one common feature: electrostatic
charging was observed under periodic stretching, in every case.

charging of common elastic materials subjected to
stretching–relaxing cycles for (A) elastic liner for clothes,
(B) rubber band, (C) wristband, (D) elastic fabric strip, and (E)
strip cut from a polyamide sock.

Because silicone develops pronounced negative potential and
natural
rubber becomes rather more positive, the two were combined to produce
electricity during stretching and relaxation. One piece of each rubber
tubing was mounted coaxially within a shielded copper cylinder that
was in turn connected to one input of a rectifying bridge. The two
rubbers were stretched and relaxed simultaneously, as shown in Figure 7A. Figure 7B shows the overall positive
output of the bridge, and 7C shows that a small
capacitor connected to the bridge output is quickly charged.

of rubber tubing. (B) Open-circuit voltage between the two inner copper
cylinders. (C) Potential difference between the leads of a 10 μF
capacitor connected to the copper cylinders through a rectifying bridge.
Experiments were performed at 60% RH.

Discussion
Rubbers have always received less attention than
thermoplastics,
in the vast literature on polymer electrostatic charging. For instance,
the careful analysis of polymer charging published by Diaz and Felix-Navarro34 concludes with a semiquantitative plot that
does not include any elastomer, even though earlier data on silicone
and olefin rubbers are mentioned by these authors. Elastomers are
also absent from the triboelectric series published by Iuga et al.,35 Fujita et al.,36 as
well as from the results published by Németh et al.37 “Rubber” appears in another published
triboelectric series, but without any information on the rubber type
used.38 Therefore, it is not surprising
that rubber charging due to stretching and contraction has not been
previously described.

The charging patterns shown by natural
and silicone rubbers are
different, but both change fast, with short equilibration times under
60–65% RH. Interestingly, fast charge dissipation takes place
when silicone is under tension, different from triboelectricity that
is the immediate outcome of mechanical action on material surfaces.

The surface charge density of natural and silicone rubber can be
calculated from the measured potential, and it is in the range of
100–250 electron charge units/μm2 or 0.01–0.025
units of charge/μm3 (considering rubber tubing volume).
Surface charge concentration is thus ca. 10–9 mol
m–2, which corresponds to only 1.2 × 10–8 at. %. Unfortunately, this is far too low to be detected
even by sensitive surface analytical techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (see also Supporting InformationSimulation Methods). For the area covered by the
copper cylinders, we estimate 28 nC/cycle for silicone rubber and
11 nC/cycle for natural rubber.

To understand charge/discharge
phenomena during rubber tubing extension
and relaxation, we checked its adherence to known types of insulator
electrostatic charging: piezoelectricity, surface piezoelectricity,
flexoelectricity, triboelectricity, and hygroelectricity that is charge
build-up associated with high atmospheric humidity.

The effect
of ambient RH supports the classification of rubber
electrification as a manifestation of hygroelectricity. On the other
hand, it does not follow the expected trends for piezoelectric or
triboelectric charging because charging should be more pronounced
under low humidity in both cases, when surface conductance is lower.

Other relevant arguments are:(i) the fast relaxation times for the
change in the charging state during both extension and relaxation
differ from what is normally observed in mechano- or tribochemical
reactions;39

(ii) rubber does not undergo friction
with any other solid, during these experiments, for which reason the
known mechanisms for tribocharging do not apply; and

(iii) rubber charging during relaxation
of the prestressed rubber does not also show the expected feature
for piezoelectric charging, when charge separation takes place during
the application of a pressure or tension to the sample going back
to the initial state under relaxation.



Flexoelectricity and surface piezoelectricity were mentioned in
the Introduction and their contributions should
also be considered. However, neither is dependent on the RH. Flexoelectricity
depends on strain gradients whose formation was minimized at the macroscopic
level, by using samples with cylindrical symmetry. Other samples with
other shapes also showed the periodic charging in phase with stretching.
However, both natural rubber and silicone rubber usually contain small
inorganic particles, either natural as in the former40 or purposely added silica particles in the latter. These
particles adhere strongly to the polymer matrix, and they may originate
local strain gradients whose effect should be assessed in future work.
Surface piezoelectricity cannot be ruled out and it should be kept
in mind, but it has been observed in crystalline materials with a
large surface-to-volume ratio only.

It is conceivable that internal
friction among the rubber chains
leads to heterolytic bond breaking and thus to the appearance of charge
within the rubber. However, neighboring positive and negative ions
together do not produce electric potential at a distance much larger
than their separation, measured by a Kelvin electrode.

Many
charging and discharging phenomena are associated with water
adsorption and desorption from the atmosphere,2,4,41,42 when a sample
is placed under nonzero potential, or when the RH changes, or still
following electrostatic charging by corona43 or friction.44

The present case
differs from other hygroelectricity phenomena
in one aspect: stretching or relaxing the rubber produces a voltage
peak that decays fast while the rubber sample remains stretched or
relaxed. Nevertheless, potential decay is significantly slower than
its rise.

Another explanation of rubber charging under periodic
stretching
derives from the following statement in Heinicke book: “...nonequilibrium
states occur at fresh surfaces during the tribosorption of gaseous
mixtures...”,26 even though this
was made for nonrubber materials.

To understand the meaning
of “fresh surface” in the
stretched rubber, we recall that solid surfaces in equilibrium with
the atmosphere are always enriched in the components with lower surface
tension, thus reaching minimal surface Gibbs energy45 and imparting hydrophobic character to the solid. Polymer
surfaces under the atmosphere are formed by low-surface-tension components:
oligomers, nonpolar chain segments, and highly branched chains. The
oxidized segments in PE remain in the subsurface unless the PE sample
is immersed in warm water, when they replace the nonpolar surface
constituents.46

Stretching the rubber
increases its surface area, so that polar
groups found at the subsurface may be exposed to the atmosphere when
the rubber is stretched, tending to migrate back to the subsurface
when the rubber is allowed to re-equilibrate.

Charge deposition
concurrent with water vapor adsorption can then
take place, and this will be governed by the Bronsted acid behavior
of the surface components: acidic groups adsorb OH– preferably to H+ ions acquiring negative charge, whereas
basic groups show the opposite behavior.47 Moreover, hydrophobic surfaces adsorb OH– preferably
to H+ ions.48−52

Both natural rubber and silicone rubber show a negative charge
soon after they are allowed to relax, in agreement with the argument
in the previous paragraph.

However, natural rubber tubing acquires
net positive charge when
pulled, different from silicone. Natural rubber is a complex material,
containing phospholipids, proteins, and many minor inorganic constituents
that provide basic groups.53 When these
are exposed in the stretched surface, water vapor adsorption takes
place carrying excess hydronium ions, thus imparting the observed
positive charge to the rubber.

On the other hand, many factors
may contribute to the observed
fast charge dissipation, following each stretching or relaxation step:
(i) different surface sites may adsorb charged water from the atmosphere
but at different rates, thus enhancing or canceling the charge imparted
by the initial load of fast-adsorbed ions; (ii) the positive or negative
charge that is initially adsorbed attracts opposite ions from inner
rubber layers or from the atmosphere, bringing them closer to the
measuring electrode and producing a charge compensation effect.

The suggested mechanism for charge accumulation and dissipation
during rubber stretching–relaxation cycles is in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Proposed mechanism for
charge build-up and dissipation in rubbery
materials.

The present results suggest that
charge and potential measurements
could be used to detect surface chemical modifications in elastomers
and other polymers. This is a great challenge, even for the most sensitive
current analytical tools. The modification of the chemical composition
of the rubber surface during extension can perhaps be verified by
using spectroscopic and other methods. In one of the few reports of
this type in the literature, the present authors identified the charging
agents produced by mutual friction of two thermoplastics by using
extremely sensitive techniques, including electron energy-loss spectroscopy.31 However, the detection of fast transient change
in the surface composition of complex polymer materials under normal
pressure remains as a great challenge, requiring the development of
new analytical tools. The best perspective to identify the minute
amounts of charging ions in electrified surfaces is probably mass
spectrometry, but its application depends on sampling techniques that
exclude any artifacts due to ion generation during sample insertion
in the instrument. Work in this direction is now being planned.

The effect described in this work seems to be quite general because
it was observed, with variations in intensity, for every elastomer
sample that was tested, including household items. Moreover, it should
also be observed in any solid or gel under mechanical tension because
surface extension and contraction modify the surface structure, probably
changing the amount and state of adsorbed water. However, the only
class of materials that can show many-fold elastic stretching are
elastomers, and this is the most likely reason why similar phenomena
have not been observed in other solids.

Beyond hygroelectricity,
there is also the possibility to develop
surface piezoelectricity and/or flexoelectricity by modifying the
rubber surface with inorganic nanoparticles, which was extensively
done in this laboratory.31,54,55 Stretching rubber nanocomposites containing large number of nanoparticles
should create strain gradients because the particle moduli are certainly
lower than the rubber matrix modulus and the particle-matrix adhesion
is often very high.56,57

Finally, the possibility
of collecting energy from stretched rubber
is demonstrated in this work, although with a low efficiency (an approximate
electrical power output of 0.2 μW). However, the experiments
reported here were designed to exclude friction and surface contact
that would not allow this to be characterized as a purely surface
stretching phenomenon. More effective energy scavenging devices are
currently under examination, attempting to benefit from every effect
that can contribute, synergistically. Because mechanical vibrations
are ubiquitous, at least part of their energy could be collected in
rubber microgenerators, instead of being dissipated in the environment.

Conclusions
Elastomers acquire charge when they are periodically stretched
and relaxed, producing periodic potential oscillations with the same
frequency as the mechanical strain. This is strongly dependent on
the RH, and it is discussed considering many possible explanations:
piezoelectricity (bulk and surface), triboelectricity, and flexoelectricity.
Another possibility is charge pick-up and dissipation by stretched
elastomers arising as the result of water adsorption and the partition
of water ions (H+ and OH–) in the rubber–air
interface, triggered by periodic rubber surface modification: buried
chemical groups are exposed during extension and hidden upon contraction.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Silicone and natural latex tubing (for laboratory
and medical use) with 5 mm internal diameter was cut in 15 cm length
pieces and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water, dried in oven at
60 °C during 60 min and kept in a desiccator prior to use. The
identity of the tubing was verified by infrared spectroscopy, and
the ash content was determined by thermogravimetric analysis. The
results are in the Supporting Information.

Electrostatic Potential Measurements during Rubber Cyclic Stretching–Relaxation
The schematic representation of our experimental setup is shown
in Figure 9 (see also Supporting Information Figure S3, Video S2). Rubber tubing was mounted on aluminum holders
lined with a PTFE sheet, on a reciprocating shaker with an oscillating
frequency of 4 Hz and an amplitude of 10 cm, unless specified otherwise.
Minimum holder distance is 12 cm, increasing up to 22 cm, periodically.
The electrostatic potential measurements were made with a Kelvin electrode
(6000B-7C, aperture size of 1.32 mm diameter) positioned at the center
of the tubing surface, kept at 2 mm above it, and connected to a Trek
model 347 voltmeter. This system can measure static potential in the
−3300 to +3300 V range. The voltmeter output was connected
to a Keithley 6514 electrometer through a low-noise triaxial cable
under high-speed acquisition rate (120 readings/s), using an USB-to-GPIB
interface (Keithley KUSB-488b). A NI USB-6009 Multifunction Data Acquisition
device was employed, alternatively. During the experiments, temperature
was 20–25 °C, and RH was in the 60–70% range or
as indicated in the figure captions.

Sample Handling Protocol
Experiments were prepared
according to the following protocol: silicone or latex tubing samples
were manually withdrawn from the storage desiccator containers using
an antistatic glove (Ted Pella ESD All-Day Glove), then mounted on
the aluminum holders lined with PTFE, and allowed to equilibrate for
30 min, prior to running the experiments. This simple procedure was
sufficient to obtain low residual potential throughout the samples,
prior to starting to stretch and relax the samples. In each run, the
electrostatic potential was initially recorded on the relaxed sample
for 60 s, then the reciprocating drive was turned on for 180 s, observing
that the final and initial rubber states were the same, either stretched
or relaxed. After the periodic motion, electrostatic potential measurement
continued for a predetermined time or until the measured potential
went down to 0 ± 2 V.

Energy Scavenging
Latex and silicone
rubber tubing
pieces were separately inserted within two coaxial, mutually insulated
copper cylinders (6.5 cm long and 1.5 cm internal diameter) as in
a bottomless Faraday cup. The experimental setup is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S3), and the running
experiment can be watched in Video S1.
The copper cylinders do not move, while the tubing is cyclically stretched
and relaxed. The internal cylinders in each pair are connected to
the input of an integrated full-wave rectifying bridge, whose output
was connected to a capacitor (10 μF), whose voltage was measured
using the Keithley 6514 electrometer.
