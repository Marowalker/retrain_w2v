Materials under high pressure often
exhibit unusual physical and
chemical behaviors. We investigated the Sc–N system under high
pressure in the range of 0–110 GPa using variable-composition
methodology implemented in Universal Structure Predictor: Evolutionary
Xtallograpgy (USPEX) in conjunction with Vienna Ab Initio Simulation
Package (VASP). The calculation led to prediction of new thermodynamically
stable compounds, Sc4N3, Sc8N7, ScN3, and ScN5, and also phase transition
of ScN5 from triclinic to monoclinic at 104 GPa. These
results are important to understand the structure of Sc–N compounds
under high pressure and their elastic and electronic properties.

Introduction
Pressure is a fundamental thermodynamic
variable that has a capacity
to alter the interatomic interactions, electron density distribution,
and bonding patterns of materials. These alterations in a material
under pressure lead to phase transitions with unusual physical and
chemical properties of the material.1 These
phases cannot be recovered at ambient condition if the changes of
properties are irreversible. Therefore, high-pressure study can be
an effective way to discover new functional materials with exciting
properties.2−5

The early transition-metal nitrides have significant importance
due to their chemical stability and outstanding mechanical properties.6−8 However, scandium nitride (ScN) has attracted significant attention
among the early transition-metal nitrides, which is due to its high
melting point of 2600 °C, high hardness, extreme corrosive behavior,
and electric conductivity.9−12 These remarkable properties categorize scandium nitride
as a refractory material and also make it suitable for thermoelectric
devices that can be operated at high temperature.13,14

A lot of work has been done on stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric
scandium nitrides.15,16 However, most of the work highlights
the electronic, optical, and chemical bonding properties in their
rock-salt structure.17−19 Many transition metals have a tendency to form nitride
compounds under extreme conditions of pressure,20−24 but the question that how many scandium nitride compounds
exist is still a mystery. Therefore, we aim in this work to reveal
this mystery by exploring crystal structures and all possible stoichiometries
of the Sc–N system in the pressure range of 0–110 GPa.
Using a state-of-the-art computation technique that has been recently
developed, i.e., Universal Structure Predictor: Evolutionary Xtallograpgy
(USPEX),25−28 we found several thermodynamically stable compounds with different
stoichiometries, Sc4N3, Sc8N7, ScN3, and Sc1N5, under
high pressure.

Results and Discussion
To reveal
the energetically most favorable structure for the Sc–N
compounds under high pressure, we systematically explored the stoichiometric
compounds of ScxNy in the pressure range of 0–110 GPa. The formation enthalpy
for the ScxNy compounds was computed relative to dissociation into constituent
elements, scandium and nitrogen, by the equation  where ΔH is
the formation
enthalpy per atom of a compound and H is the calculated
enthalpy of each constituent element. We constructed a convex hull
plot to incorporate all possible decomposition routes of the Sc–N
system at pressures of 0, 30, 50, 75, 100, and 110 GPa, as shown in Figure 1. Only the structures
located on the convex hull are considered stable structures, and those
lying above the convex hull are unstable or metastable structures.
At ambient pressure of 0 GPa, the ScN (Fm3̅m, space group 225) compound appears on the convex hull
and its calculated lattice parameter a = 4.518 Å
is in good agreement with the experimental values, 4.50129 and 4.512 Å.30 Hence, this calculation validates the methodology applied to the
Sc–N system under zero-pressure condition. Although the Sc4N3, Sc8N7, ScN3, and ScN5 compounds are lying above the convex hull at
0 GPa, they become stable at higher pressures, as depicted in Figure 1. To reveal the pressure
stability of these stoichiometric compounds, we constructed the pressure–composition
phase diagram as shown in Figure 2a. Our search reproduced the scandium phases, i.e.
(P63/mmc, space group
194) and (I4/mmm, space group 139),31 and also four phases of nitrogen, i.e., (Pa3̅ space group 205), (P21/c, space group 14), (P41212, space group 92), and (I213, space group 199);32 herein, scandium
and nitrogen are the basic constituents for the stoichiometric compounds
and the appearance of their phases in our search also validates our
methodology. The ScN (Fm3̅m, space group 225) compound remains thermodynamically stable throughout
the considered pressure range. The predicted pressure phase diagram
also indicates that the Sc8N7 (C2/m, space group 12) compound is stable from 5 to
45 GPa, Sc4N3 (I4̅3d, space group 220) compound above 80 GPa, and triclinic
ScN3 (P1̅, space group 2) above
29 GPa. One of the most interesting predicted structures ScN5 belongs to the family of pentazolate compounds, which have been
investigated more closely in recent years than at any time since their
first synthesis. CsN533 and
NaN534 are newly explored pentazolate
compounds; these nitrogen-rich compounds can decompose to dinitrogen
N2 with a large energy release. We also explored phase
transition of the stoichiometric compound ScN5 at 104 GPa
from triclinic to monoclinic, as shown in Figure 2b.

The four new stoichiometric compounds found in our search
are shown

structural details are summarized in Table 1. The Sc4N3 (I4̅3d, space group 220, four formula
units) structure has the lattice parameter, a = 6.225
Å, at 100 GPa. Inequivalent Sc atoms occupy the Wyckoff position,
16c (0.182, 0.182, and 0.182), and the other inequivalent
N atoms take the Wyckoff position, 12b (0.875, 0.0,
and 0.25). The Sc–N bond length ranges from 2.049 to 2.268
Å. The scandium atom is coordinated with six nitrogen atoms.

The Sc8N7 (C2/m, space group 12, two formula units) stoichiometry
has the lattice
parameters, a = 13.348 Å, b = 3.068 Å, c = 10.60 Å, α = γ
= 90.0°, and β = 48.609° at 30 GPa. Four inequivalent
Sc atoms occupy the Wyckoff positions, Sc1 4i (−0.375,
0.0, 0.313), Sc2 4i (0.126, 0.0, 0.064), Sc3 4i (0.369, 0.0, 0.195), and Sc4 4i (0.123,
0.0, −0.435), and four nitrogen atoms occupy the Wyckoff positions,
N1 4i (−0.247, 0.0, 0.370), N2 4i (0.499, 0.0, 0.247), N3 4i (0.251, 0.0, 0.123),
and N4 2c (0.0, 0.0, 0.500). The Sc atom is coordinated
with six nearby nitrogen atoms, and the bond length of Sc–N
is 2.176 Å.

The ScN3 (P1̅,
space group 2,
two formula units) has the lattice parameters, a =
4.486 Å, b = 5.057 Å, c = 3.034 Å, α = 102.192°, β = 98.35°,
and γ = 99.315°, at 30 GPa. The scandium atom lies on the
Wyckoff position, 2i (−0.208, 0.194, 0.412),
and three nitrogen atoms occupy N1 2i (−0.170,
−0.324, −0.106), N2 2i (0.360, −0.472,
0.002), and N3 2i (−0.291, −0.124,
−0.249). In this structure, N atoms form a chain of six atoms
and the shortest distance between them is 1.345 Å. These nitrogen
atoms are coordinated with two nearest Sc atoms with a bond length
of 2.181 Å.

The ScN5 (P1̅,
space group 2,
two formula units) has the lattice parameters, a =
5.084 Å, b = 4.427 Å, c = 4.345 Å, α = 70.349°, β = 101.130°,
and γ = 103.458°, at 50 GPa; the Sc atom occupies the Wyckoff
position, Sc 2i (0.187, 0.757, 0.677), while the
N atoms occupy the Wyckoff positions, N1 2i (0.746,
0.933, 0.044), N2 2i (0.5987, 0.4306, 0.58545), N3
2i (0.364, 0.170, 0.209), N4 2i (0.737,
0.563, 0.814), and N5 2i (0.906, 0.780, 0.265). However,
at 104 GPa, it is transformed to a monoclinic structure with the lattice
parameters, a = 4.363 Å, b =
4.138 Å, c = 4.364 Å, α = γ
= 90.0°, and β = 106.244° and the Wyckoff positions,
Sc 2a (0.069, 0.0, −0.300), N1 2a (−0.385, 0.0, −0.149), N2 2a (0.203,
0.0, 0.173), N3 4b (0.220, 0.252, 0.349), and N4
2a (−0.376, 0.0, 0.158).

To confirm
the dynamic stability of these predicted structures,
we recorded the phonon dispersion spectra. It is mandatory for the
dynamic stability to have the positive phonon frequencies in the whole
Brillouin zone. Any structure having a negative or an imaginary frequency
in the Brillouin zone is considered as dynamically unstable. Our recorded
phonon spectra in Figure 4 show that there is no imaginary frequency in the whole Brillouin
zone, which confirms the dynamic stability of our predicted structures.

(d) Sc4N3 (I4̅3d) at 100 GPa; and (e) ScN5 (Cm) at 110 GPa.

The atomic interaction
between Sc and N atoms in the Sc–N
compounds was revealed by calculating the Bader charges for all predicted
stoichiometries at respective pressures. The Bader charges transferred
from Sc to N atoms for Sc4N3, Sc8N7, ScN3, and ScN5 are 1.3, 1.6,
1.7, and 1.8, respectively. This also indicates that as the N concentration
is increased, the charge transfer from Sc to N also increases. To
further explore the bonding nature of compounds, we calculated the
electron localization function (ELF), which determines the likelihood
of electrons in the nearby space of a crystal. The ELF values generally
lie between 0 and 1; the values higher than 0.5 correspond to the
covalent bonding, core electrons, and lone pairs. The value 0.5 corresponds
to the electron gas, while the lower value corresponds to metallic
or ionic bonds. As shown in Figure 5, the ELF values are higher between the nearest nitrogen
atoms, which shows that the bonding between them is covalent. However,
Sc and N formed metallic or ionic bonds because the ELF value is lower
between them.

at 110 GPa; and (e) Sc8N7 (C2/m) at 30 GPa, where the purple sphere represents
Sc atom and the gray sphere represents N atom.

For the electronic properties of the Sc–N system,
we calculated
the band structure of all of the predicted structures at respective
pressures, as shown in Figure 6. The horizontal dashed line in the figure illustrates the
Fermi energy level, and bands of all predicted structures are crossing
the Fermi level, which shows that our predicted stable structures
are metallic in nature. However, we also calculated the band structure
of ScN5 with hybrid function Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
used in density functional theory (DFT), and it opened a narrow band
gap 0.24 eV, as shown in Figure 6c.

(a) ScN3 at 30 GPa; (b) Sc8N7 at

ScN5 at 50 GPa; and (d) Sc4N3 at
100 GPa.

We also investigated the mechanical
stability of the predicted
structures because it is the necessary condition for a structure to
exist. Elastic constants contain all of the necessary information
to understand the mechanical properties and are also helpful for estimating
the hardness of a material. We calculated the elastic constants of
the predicted structures, which are tabulated in Table 2. These calculated elastic constants
satisfy the mechanical stability criteria,35 and the elastic matrix for each compound contains positive eigenvalues,
which further proves the elastic stability of the considered structures.
Bulk modulus and shear modulus depict the material resistance to volumetric
changes and shape deformation; materials with high bulk modulus are
considered strong in resisting uniform compression, while materials
with high shear modulus can have high hardness because shear modulus
is related to hardness. The calculated values of B, G, and Hv are tabulated
in Table 2, which shows
that the bulk modulus increases as the nitrogen content increases
in the compound. For the ScN cubic structure, our calculated elastic
constants C11, C12, and C44(36) and bulk modulus of 198.38 GPa are in good agreement with
the literature value, 198 GPa,12 which
supports our calculation for other structures as well because there
is no published data on these compounds to the best of our knowledge.
The estimated hardnesses of ScN, Sc8N7, and
ScN5 compounds are 25, 24, and 23.6 GPa, respectively,
while those of ScN3, ScN5, and Sc4N3 are 17.5, 17.4, and 17.0 GPa, respectively. The bulk
modulus-to-shear modulus ratio, k = G/B, indicates the ductility and brittleness of a
material; the critical value of k is about 1.75.37 The materials having k-values
greater than 1.75 are ductile and those having lower values are brittle.
The calculated Pugh ratios for ScN, Sc8N7, and
ScN3 are 1.28, 1.44, and 1.69, respectively, indicating
that these compounds are brittle. However, the Pugh ratios for ScN5 and Sc4N3 are 1.79 and 2.0, respectively,
indicating that they are ductile. The ductility and brittleness of
a material can also be differentiated by Poisson’s ratio, whose
value greater than 0.26 indicates better ductile materials. Poisson’s
ratio v also gives insights into the characteristics
of bonding forces: for covalent materials, the value is 0.1, while
for ionic materials, it is 0.25. For a central force solid, the value
is between 0.25 and 0.5.38Table 2 shows our calculated values
of v and indicates that for ScN5 and Sc4N3, the interatomic force is central while for
ScN, Sc8N7, and ScN3, it has ionic
bonding characteristics.

Conclusions
In summary, we systematically investigated the Sc–N system
in the pressure range of 0–110 GPa using variable-composition
methodology implemented in USPEX in conjunction with VASP. The calculation
enables us to find new thermodynamically stable compounds, Sc4N3, Sc8N7, ScN3, and ScN5. We also explored the phase transition of ScN5 from triclinic to monoclinic at 104 GPa. Our results are
also important for understanding the structures, electronic properties,
and elastic properties of Sc–N compounds under high pressures.

Computational
Details
To discover all potential ScxNy structures under high pressure
for the Sc–N
system, an extensive search for stable compounds was performed using
the evolutionary algorithm and variable-composition strategy implemented
in USPEX code in conjunction with Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package
(VASP).39

The variable-composition
evolutionary search was carried out at
pressures of 0, 30, 50, 75, 100, and 110 GPa by keeping 8–16
atoms in a primitive cell to find stable compositions. Then, we performed
a fixed-composition search of each of these stable compositions with
different formula units. The first-generation structures were produced
randomly, and the number of structures in this generation was kept
large. The consequent generations were obtained by applying different
operators in the following percentages: heredity, 40%; lattice mutation,
20%; and atom transmutation, 20%, while 20% randomly produced structures
were also added in each generation. The USPEX calculation efficiency
is found to increase by applying these key parameters.

Total
energy calculations were executed in the density functional
theory (DFT) framework within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
parametrization of generalized gradient approximation,40 as implemented in VASP code. The projector-augmented
wave method described the interaction between the ions and the electrons
with a cutoff energy of 520 eV. The 3d14s2 (cutoff
radius, 2.5 au)41 and 2s22p3 (cutoff radius, 1.5 au)42 were
treated as valence states in the Sc and N atoms, respectively. A uniform
Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack grid with a higher resolution
of 2π × 0.03 Å–1 was used to sample
the Brillouin zone, which also confirmed that the total energies were
≤10–3 eV/atom. Moreover, all forces on atoms
were converged to ≤10–3 eV/Å and the
total stress tensor deviated from the target pressure by ≤10–2 GPa. The phonon dispersion curve was calculated to
determine the dynamical stability of the predicted structures using
the finite displacement methodology, as implemented in the PHONOPY
code.43 The charge transferred was calculated
using Bader’s quantum theory.44 All
structures were visualized and plotted using VESTA.45 The elastic stiffness constants were calculated using the
strain–stress methodology;46 we
used the ELATE47 code to obtain the bulk
modulus B, shear modulus G, Young’s
modulus E, and Poisson’s ratio. There are
several models to calculate the theoretical Vickers hardness, but
Chen’s model48 is considered more
accurate.49 We used Chen’s model
to estimate the theoretical Vickers hardness Hv by the relation, Hv = 2(k2G)0.585 –
3, where k = G/B is the Pugh ratio.
