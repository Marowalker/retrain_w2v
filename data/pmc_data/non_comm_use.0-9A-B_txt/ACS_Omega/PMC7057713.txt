This article focuses on the flow
assurance of waxy crude oil using
an environmentally benign and cost-effective approach involving thermochemical
reaction. The study incorporates experimental and simulation works
to evaluate heat and pressure generation potentials and heat transfer
efficiency of the thermochemical fluids. Experimental results reveal
that at the concentration (1 M) of thermochemical fluid (TCF) ranging
between 14 and 33% v/wt of the waxy oil, sufficient heat could be
generated to raise the temperature of the oil significantly above
the pour point (48 °C). In addition, from the bench-top treatment
of a damaged tubing, it was observed that more than 95% of the deposited
wax could be removed using the thermochemical solutions. Subsequently,
a large-scale application of the technology in a long-distance flow
assurance of waxy crude oil was confirmed through process simulation.
Ultimately, the simulation results revealed the capacity of the method
to improve the temperature and pressure profiles of the pipe flow
system, and most significantly, to remove wax deposition up to 98%.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Crude oil, a complex mixture
of hydrocarbons, contains several
components such as paraffins, aromatics, resins, and asphalthenes.
Some of these substances, most especially the heavy molecules, paraffin
wax, and asphaltene, cause serious flow assurance problems due to
their thermodynamic instability. In fact, crude oils may contain up
to 33% wax, which can crystallize during various hydrocarbon operations
such as production, transportation, and storage.1−3

Generally,
due to changes in thermodynamic intensive properties,
viz., pressure, temperature, and composition of hydrocarbon, precipitation
of organic flow assurance solids including gas hydrates, asphaltene,
and paraffin wax often occurs.4 Thus, there
are several complexities at different phases of operations in the
oil and gas industries.5,6 Compared to other solids, wax
precipitation is a major problem in oil production and transportation
facilities.7−9 The high-molecular-weight paraffin wax (C20+) at reservoir conditions is dissolved in the petroleum fluid. However,
as the crude oil flows toward the processing facilities and gradually
becomes colder, the solubility of the paraffin molecules reduces10 and, subsequently, wax deposition and accumulation
may occur inside the good completion facilities, surface facilities,
and transportation pipelines. Worse still, wax build-up in the pipeline
could lead to significant pressure drop, which may result in a production
shutdown.

Furthermore, wax precipitation is a function of temperature
rather
than pressure. Thus, it can deposit when the temperature falls below
what is identified as the wax appearance temperature (WAT).11 At such a condition, the flow behavior becomes
non-Newtonian and the effective viscosity increases significantly.12−14 The increase in viscosity leads to high resistance to flow and,
invariably, increases the pressure drop along the production system.15 This eventually results in the loss of hydrocarbons,
pipe plugging, and consequently high operational cost.2,3 Thus, transportation of waxy crude oil is normally performed above
the WAT to avoid the stated problems.

Several preventive and
remediation treatment strategies including
thermal, mechanical, chemical, and biological methods have been applied
to mitigate the wax deposition problem.11,13,16,17 Generally, in chemical
treatment, polymeric chemical additives are used to decrease the pour
point, viscosity, and yield stress of waxy crude oil. The polymers
prevent aggregation or precipitation of wax-forming particles by forming
the interparticle barriers (i.e., modify the crystallinity of the
waxes), which ensures continuous flow of the paraffinic oil. However,
such chemicals are often limited by compatibility issues, cost, and
environmental or health implications. In the case of extreme fall
in temperature, a large dosage of these chemicals might be required.
On the other hand, due to the sensitivity of wax precipitation to
temperature, a thermal method such as steam conditioning and thermal
coating, injection of hot oil, thermal insulation, etc. have been
considered as the most effective method to mitigate wax deposition
problem. However, surface generation of steam and hot fluids can become
less effective due to heat loss. In addition, other challenges such
as environmental pollution from emission of greenhouse gas (GHG),
and high operational cost are associated with steam generation through
the conventional method.18

These
challenges have necessitated the search for alternative technologies
to tackle the wax deposition problem. Recently, advancements in thermal
stimulation technology, heat energy, and pressure generated from the
exothermic reactions of certain chemical reactants have been assessed
for their prospective applications in several areas of petroleum production,
enhanced oil recovery, fracturing, and formation damage control.19−23 Thermochemical treatment is one of the promising methods that could
be used for the thermal stimulation of the production wells to alleviate
formation damage and improve hydrocarbon production.24,25 Using specific thermochemical fluids (TCFs), high temperature (up
to 260 °C) and pressure (up to 2000 psi) can be generated downhole.23 The use of thermochemical fluids such as magnesium
sulfate, ammonium chloride, and sodium nitrate solutions to generate
heat and pressure at downhole conditions has been reported in the
literature.20,21 Moreover, the heat and pressure
generated during the typical thermochemical reaction can be controlled
by adjusting the fluids’ concentration and pH. For example,
lower pressure and temperature can be generated using low chemical
concentrations or high solution pH. In addition, these chemicals may
be injected using a pump in continuous, batch, or semibatch mode to
ensure efficient performance and, ultimately, for safety purposes.
Furthermore, depending on the specific technical requirement during
typical field applications, such as internal corrosion control during
transportation, the pH of the solution can be adjusted to a neutral
level to avoid corrosion. Thus, the chemical formulation with a pH
between 6.8 and 7 before and after the chemical reaction was used
in this study.

However, despite the efficiency of the thermochemical
treatment,
it has not received much attention in the mitigation of flow assurance
problem. In addition, prior to this article, similar scientific publication
on wax mitigation using thermochemical treatment has rarely been reported.
Moreover, the successful application of the technology required information,
which can predict its performance on a large scale. Therefore, the
focus of this work is to harness the potentials of the thermochemical
technology in mitigating wax deposition problems and simulate the
feasibility of the method for long-distance pipeline applications.
Experimental studies were carried out to assess the heat and pressure
released from a thermochemical reaction, as well as heat transfer
efficiency in the presence of waxy crude oil. Subsequently, the information
obtained from the experimental studies was used in the process simulation
of the pipeline transportation of a typical waxy crude oil.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Assessment of Thermochemical
Heat Source
The thermochemical heat source involves exothermic
reaction, with
sufficient potential to release heat energy to the surrounding system.
Essentially, this concept relies on dissolution or liquefaction of
the deposited wax through heat transfer from the chemical reaction
in the pipeline. Previous studies have shown that thermochemical fluids
showed very effective performance in generating heat under certain
conditions.19−24 As observed from the experimental studies, Figure 1 presents a typical temperature–pressure
profile obtained from the reaction. The figure shows that the temperature
change (ΔT) of 67 °C and the pressure
change (ΔP) of 1610 psi, simultaneously, could
be obtained from the reaction. Accordingly, the enthalpy change of
the system, ΔH, due to heat released from the chemical reaction
is 370 kJ/mol, regardless of the reactor operating temperatures ranging
from 20 to ≈100 °C. Given the molarity of the reagents
used in this study, the reaction was of first order (n = 1) with the activation energy Ea ≈
35.5 kJ/mol.

Figure 1 Temperature and pressure profiles versus thermochemical
reaction
time.

Furthermore, Figure 2 is the temperature change
obtained from the reaction of the thermochemical
fluids in the presence of wax. From these results, it can be observed
that the temperature of the system (a mixture of waxy crude oil and
thermochemical fluid) increases due to heat transfer from the thermochemical
reaction to the waxy crude oil. However, as expected, the temperature
change varies with respect to the volume of thermochemical fluid added
to the wax. The temperature change (ΔT) varies
as 40, 44, 54, and 71 °C with 14, 22, 28, and 33% v/wt of the
waxy crude oil, respectively.

Figure 2 Temperature profiles of a mixture of wax and
different concentrations
of thermochemical fluids.

2.2 Effect of Temperature on the Physical Properties
of Wax
As stated earlier, temperature plays a major role
in the phase behavior of hydrocarbon fluids. The discussion in this
section is primarily informed by the intention to understand, specifically,
the effect of temperature on certain properties of interest, viz.,
the viscosity, density, and surface tension. This can also provide
further clues on the prospects of the proposed cleaning method. In Figure 3, as expected, the
results show that the viscosity of the waxy crude oil decreases from
76.4 cP at room temperature to 5.1 cP at 90 °C (and a constant
shear rate of 5.1 s–1). In addition, as presented
in Figure 4, the rheological
data indicate that the waxy fluid exhibit a non-Newtonian behavior
at room temperature (23 °C) and low shear rates (0–200
s–1). This observation might be connected with low
fluidity at low shear rates and low temperatures. In comparison, at
higher temperatures (38–90 °C), the fluid shows a negligible
response to the shear rates (i.e., Newtonian behavior). Furthermore,
the change in density and surface tension of the waxy crude oil due
to temperature change is presented in Figure 5. It shows that the density reduces from
0.85 to 0.79 between room temperature (23 °C) and 90 °C,
respectively. Similarly, the surface tension follows the same trend
by decreasing from 69.8 to 59.5 mN/m between 23 and 90 °C, respectively.
Thus, regarding the performance of the thermochemical reaction reported
earlier, it could be concluded that the system can generate sufficient
temperature to improve the flow behavior of typical waxy oil since
the density and surface tension decreased significantly at similar
temperatures generated by the reaction.

2.3 Performance of Thermochemical
Treatment
2.3.1 Wax Removal
Wax precipitation and
deposition due to a decrease in the pipeline wall temperature below
the WAT is a well-understood phenomenon. As earlier reported, when
the temperature of the wall of the pipeline falls below the WAT, the
wax layer is formed and grows with time. The deposited wax can reduce
the inner diameter of the production pipes, which subsequently increases
the required pressure to displace the hydrocarbon along the pipelines.
In addition, the accumulated wax can increase the pipe roughness and
then increase the pressure drop. Overall, the deposited wax on the
pipe wall leads to a reduction in pipe durability and an increase
in production cost.

Figure 6 shows the treated pipe before and after wax removal
treatment. It was observed that 84.24% of the wax was removed during
the first cycle of thermochemical injection (using thermochemical–wax
crude oil ratio of 14% v/wt) and 15.16% of the wax was removed during
the second cycle at the same ratio. As demonstrated in Section 2.2, the primary
mechanism for removing the deposited wax is heat transfer from the
thermochemical reaction. Furthermore, using 33% v/wt thermochemical
to wax crude oil ratio, it was observed that 95% of wax was removed
after a single treatment.

Figure 6 Images for the production tubing before (a)
and after (b) thermochemical
treatment for removing the partial wax deposition.

2.3.2 Integrity of the Production System
It is expected that wax removal methods may affect the integrity
of the production system. Specifically, certain chemical treatments
may cause corrosion of the pipe. Likewise, mechanical treatment could
induce pipe enlargement, which could lead not only to significant
pressure drop but also cause a reduction in strength and/or durability
of the treated pipe.

As shown in Figure 7, by visual observation, no precipitation
or debris was observed on the steel. This confirms that the thermochemical
fluids did not react with the steel under the present experimental
conditions. Moreover, as presented in Table 1, there was no change in the weight of the
material after exposure to the thermochemical treatment.

Figure 7 Images of the
treated tubing before wax deposition (top) and after
thermochemical treatment (bottom).

and after the Wax Removal Treatment
 	inner
diameter (in.)	weight (g)	
damage type	before treatment	after treatment	before treatment	after treatment	
wax deposition	1.59	1.59	7.93	7.93	
Elsewhere
in the literature,23 it was
reported that typical thermochemical fluids could generate high temperature
and pressure up to 260 °C and 5000 psi, respectively, based on
the volume and concentrations. Therefore, the injected chemicals to
remove the deposited wax should be precisely selected to avoid any
damage to the production equipment.

2.4 Simulation
Results: Improvement of Pipeline
Flow Profiles
Heat and mass transfer occur during the flow
of petroleum fluid through the pipeline. At a particular flow rate,
the heat loss to the surroundings of the pipeline inadvertently causes
the axial temperature profile along the pipeline.27 The temperature profiles along the pipeline of the waxy
oil with different contents of thermochemical additives are presented
in Figure 8. The figure
shows that the temperature generally decreases along the length of
the pipeline. However, the results clearly reveal the efficiency of
the thermochemical additive in raising the temperature of the fluid.
Specifically, compared to the reference case (without thermochemical
additive), the fluid temperatures, by adding 14–33% v/wt additive,
show a significant increase above the pour point (48.8) of the crude
oil considered in the simulation study.

Figure 8 Temperature profile along
the pipeline at different quantities
of TCF injected.

Similarly, during the
flow, mass transfer and/or molecular diffusion
due to concentration gradient induces precipitation of wax and subsequent
deposition on the wall of the pipeline. At the same time, the concentration
gradient is influenced by the radial temperature gradient. The deposition
thickness along the length of the pipeline at different concentrations
of thermochemical additives is presented in Figure 9. This figure also shows that deposition
thickness is higher at the inlet of the pipeline and decreases toward
the outlet of the pipeline. Moreover, the addition of thermochemical
also confirms that the thickness decreases as the concentration of
the thermochemical additive increases. With reference to the onset
deposition thickness (see Figure 10), the results show that wax deposition could be liquefied
by 62, 84, 94, and 98% of the original wax due to the addition of
14, 22, 28, and 32% v/wt of the thermochemical fluid, respectively.
These data are fairly comparable to the experimental data for wax
removal from the contaminated pipe discussed earlier.

of TCF injected.

Figure 10 Total wax deposition
in the pipeline at different quantities of
TCF injected.

Finally, the pressure drop profile
and total pressure drop along
the pipeline are presented in Figures 11 and 12, respectively.
The results indicate that the pressure decreases as the fluid flows
toward the outlet of the pipeline. Most interestingly, it also confirms
the ability of the proposed method to raise the flow pressure as well
as the temperature. Therefore, in addition to mitigating wax deposition,
the results show improved flow conditions due to enhancement of the
flowing pressure, which is an advantage over the traditional hot fluid
injection or thermal insulation techniques. Similar observations have
been reported from our previous works20,28 focusing on
heavy oil recovery using the thermochemical injection concept.

3 Conclusions
This investigation presents a novel and cost-effective technique
for mitigating wax deposition and sustaining the flow of hydrocarbon
in the pipeline. Therein, exothermic chemical reaction, which generates
both heat and pressure at certain conditions, was performed. The study
incorporates both experimental and process simulation approaches.
Experimental results confirm that the chemical can sufficiently raise
the temperature of the highly waxy oil above the pour point. It was
also observed that more than 95% of the deposited wax could be removed
from a contaminated tubing with no visible damage to the tubing material.
Moreover, using the ratio of thermochemical fluid with waxy crude
oil ranging between 14 and 33% v/wt, the simulation results show significant
improvement in the flow conditions in terms of flow temperature, flow
pressure, overall pressure drop, and, most significantly, reduction
in wax deposition of up to 98%. Ultimately, the prospects of field-scale
application for long-distance pipeline transportation of waxy crude
oil has been confirmed.

an Arabian Oil Company.

4.2 Experimental Methodology
4.2.1 Assessment of Thermochemical Heat Source
To obtain
quantitative energetic information, the thermochemical
reaction was monitored in a close insulated system to study the heat
and pressure generation. The schematic of the setup is shown in Figure 13. The setup consists
of a high temperature and high pressure (HTHP) microreactor, nitrogen
gas cylinder for pressure control, heater, and temperature and pressure
sensors interfaced with a computer. Certain volumes of equimolar concentrations
of the reactants (1 M) were fed into the reactor. The progress of
the reaction was observed by collecting the data for an increase in
temperature and pressure at equal time intervals through the data
logging system. To ensure reliable temperature recording, a temperature
meter (BST-DL102 Thermocouple Thermometer) was also used in conjunction
with the temperature sensor. The stoichiometry equation of the thermochemical
reaction is presented in eq 1 1  

Figure 13 Setup

4.2.2 Measurement of Physical
Properties of Wax
Effects of temperature on some pertinent
physical properties of
waxy crude oil including surface tension, density, and viscosity were
measured to gain a deeper understanding of this concept. The surface
tension was tested at different temperatures (and atmospheric pressure)
using the KRUSS Tensiometer (Model K11, Germany) equipped with a Brookfield
programmable temperature regulator. Likewise, the specific gravity
was determined at different temperatures using the hydrometer and
temperature-controlled environment (constant temperature hydrometer
bath). The viscosity of the wax crude oil was measured using the Ofite
Viscometer (Model 900, OFI Testing Equipment Inc., Houston Texas),
which is a type of Couette coaxial cylindrical and rotational viscometer.
About 160 mL of dispersion sample was used for each test run. The
viscometer was set to precondition the sample by homogenizing it at
the speed of 300 rpm and 30 °C for 5 min. The viscometer was
operated at a low shear rate of 5.1 s–1 to a high
shear rate of 1021.4 s–1 at a temperature between
23 and 90 °C. The instruments were regularly calibrated during
the entire experiment.

4.2.3 Wax Dissolution Study:
Bench-top Experiments
4.2.3.1 Thermochemical Reaction
in the Presence
of Wax
The heat generation potential of the thermochemical
reactants in the presence of wax crude oil was investigated. The temperature
profile due to heat generation from the reaction was also recorded.
This was done to study heat transfer efficiency and compatibility
(possibility of forming precipitates) between the thermochemical reactants
and wax. Thus, waxy crude oil and the thermochemical fluids at different
concentrations (14, 22, 28, and 33% v/wt of waxy crude oil) were held
in the microreactor. The reaction between the thermochemical fluid
and typical wax (n-paraffin) is simplified in Figure 14.

Figure 14 Description of reaction
between thermochemical fluids and typical n-paraffin
petroleum wax.

4.2.3.2 Wax
Removal from Production Facility
Furthermore, with the aim
of validating the efficiency of the proposed
system, a sample of steel tubing containing accumulated wax was cleaned
using thermochemical fluids. This was done by injecting the fluids
into the material. Two cycles of injection were performed. The performance
of thermochemical treatment was evaluated by measuring the weight
of the wax removed after each cycle. The weight of the steel tubing
was also measured before and after exposure to the thermochemical
reactants for up to 1 h. The percentage of wax removal was calculated
using eq 2. 2  where W1 is the
initial pipe weight before wax deposition (g), W2 is the pipe weight after wax deposition (g), and W3 is the pipe weight after thermochemical treatment
(g).

4.3 Simulation of Single-Phase
Flow Assurance
of Waxy Crude Oil with Thermochemical Additive
The conceptual
design of mitigation of wax deposition using thermochemical treatment
is shown in Figure 15. The system refers to a similar case, which was designed for wax
removal using fused chemical means.26 Essentially,
the figure simplifies the proposed thermochemical injection method.
It presents the potential offered by thermochemical reactants to raise
the effective temperature within the flow line to the desired temperature
above the WAT.

Figure 15 Illustration of the proposed thermochemical treatment
method.

4.3.1 Process Modeling
Long-distance
transportation scenario was simulated using AspenTech HYSYS process
modeling and simulation package. The model considers the single-phase
flow of incompressible fluid in the pipeline. The background mathematical
functions presented in eqs 3–7 compute the temperature profile,
wax deposition, pipeline wall heat transfer, pressure profile, and
the total pressure drop, respectively.4,27 The bulk wall
temperature profile along the pipeline due to the steady-state flow
can be calculated using eq 3 3  where TL is the
temperature at distance L downstream the pipeline; Ti and To are the
inlet and the constant ambient temperatures, respectively; ṁ is the mass transfer of the fluid in the pipeline; D is the internal diameter of the pipe; Cp is the specific heat capacity of the fluid; and U is the overall heat transfer coefficient.

During
the flow of the waxy crude oil, the wax is precipitated at the temperature
below the WAT. With an assumption of instantaneous boundary layer
precipitation rates, the wax deposition can be calculated using the
molecular diffusion model, which is expressed as follows 4  where mx is the
mass of wax-forming component, t is the time, ρo is the density of the waxy crude oil, δx is the effective diffusion coefficient for the wax-forming component, A is the deposition area, wx is the weight fraction of the wax-forming component, and r is the radial distance. dT/dr is the radial temperature gradient, while dwx/dT is the solubility coefficient of the
wax crystal in the oil phase.

The pressure gradient profile
is calculated by solving the momentum
equation describing the steady-state incompressible single-phase flow
through a horizontal pipeline (eq 5). 5  The total pressure over the entire pipeline
(comprising the gravitation (g), acceleration (a), and the friction (f) terms) is defined
by eq 6. 6  Equation 5 reduces to the Darcy–Weisbach equation (eq 7) for a perfectly horizontal pipe
with a uniform cross-sectional area. 7  Moreover, a typical highly waxy crude oil
having 35% wax content was selected from the simulator library. The
physical properties of the oil and the pipeline conditions are detailed
in Table 2. In addition, Figures 16 and 17 give the fractional composition and the wax distribution
by composition of the oil, respectively.
