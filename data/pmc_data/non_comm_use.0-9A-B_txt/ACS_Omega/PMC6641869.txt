Building folded short peptides that
are driven by the intramolecular
hydrogen bonding in aqueous solutions remains challenging because
of their highly competitive intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions
with water solvent molecules that would have favored the extended
conformations. Here, we show folded β-turn structures in acyl
amino acid-based N-amidothioureas, the nonclassic
azapeptides, in aqueous solutions, as well as in solid-state and organic
solvents, by X-ray crystal structures, DFT calculations, 1D and 2D
NMR spectra, and absorption and CD spectra. The achiral phenylthiourea
chromophore acts as a CD reporter for the β-turn structure that
communicates the chirality of the amino acid residue to the achiral
thiourea moiety and the relative intensity of the intramolecular hydrogen
bond that stabilizes the turn structure. The amidothiourea moiety
represents a versatile structural framework for folded short peptides
in aqueous environments.

Introduction
Folded short peptides
have exhibited potential applications in
organocatalysis, molecular sensing, and therapeutics.1−3 However, short peptides prefer to adopt extended conformations in
aqueous solutions to maximize the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding
interactions with water molecules. Therefore, building folded short
peptides brought about by intramolecular hydrogen bonding in aqueous
environments remains challenging. Several strategies have been explored,
such as by forming cyclic peptides that fix the folded structures
via covalent bonds4,5 or incorporating proline or the d-amino acid residue that promotes restricted conformation,6,7 yet they are limited by their complicated molecular design and syntheses.
We set to develop a facile structural framework for folded short peptides
in aqueous solutions, based on our recent observation of β-turn
structures in a series of short nonclassic azapeptides, the peptide-based N-amidothioureas (1a, 1b, and 1c, Scheme 1) in solid-state and organic solvents.8 We have shown that these folded structures can be employed to build
molecular beacons9 and supramolecular helical
structures.10 The conformations of such
azapeptides in aqueous conditions have yet to be clarified that if
the folded structures would remain. We envisaged that such azapeptides
may be structural candidates for the short folded peptides in aqueous
solutions. This is because (i) the extended backbone of such azapeptides
is actually not linear but folded, which is driven by lone pair–lone
pair repulsion of the N–N bond and manifested by the distinct
Ramachandran φ and ψ dihedral angles,11 (ii) the intramolecular hydrogen bond that stabilizes the
β-turn structure is enhanced by the higher acidity of the thioureido
−NH proton compared to that of the amido −NH protons
in peptides and in classic azapeptides (2a, 2b, and 2c, Scheme 1),12,13 and (iii) the S atom is a weaker
hydrogen bonding acceptor than the O atom14 that reduces the intermolecular hydrogen bonding of the azapeptides
with water molecules.

φ and ψ are the Ramachandran dihedral angles.

As a proof-of-principle, we chose acyl-alanine-,
acyl-leucine-,
and acyl-phenylalanine-based N-amidothioureas (1a, 1b, and 1c, Scheme 1) as molecular targets for
folded structures in aqueous solutions. The conformational properties
of these azapeptides were characterized by X-ray crystal structures,
DFT calculations, absorption and CD spectra, and 1D and 2D NMR spectra.
Folded β-turn structures were shown in aqueous solutions. The
phenylthiourea chromophore showing absorption at longer wavelength
than those of many amino acid residues acts as a CD reporter for the
β-turn structure and the relative strength of the hydrogen bond
in both organic and aqueous solutions. Our results suggest that the
peptide-based N-amidothioureas could be a structural
motif for folded short peptides in aqueous solutions.

Results and Discussion
Acyl amino acid-based N-amidothioureas (1a, 1b, and 1c, Scheme 1) were synthesized through
the procedures outlined in Scheme S1 (Supporting Information). Crystals of 1a, 1b,
and 1c were obtained by slow evaporation of the respective
solutions in the CH3OH/CH3CN mixture, and the
structures were elucidated by X-ray crystallography (for crystallographic
data, see Table S1). For 1a, a ten-member intramolecular ring hydrogen bond (N4–Hd···O1, 2.312 Å in length, 162.60°
in angle, Table S2) was found, which is
indicative of the β-turn structure (Figure 1). The distance from Cαi to Cαi+3 is 5.342
Å, within the distance criterion of a β-turn structure
(Cαi – Cαi+3 ≤ 7 Å) defined for peptides and proteins.15 The β-turn structure in 1a is of type II, according to the Ramachandran φ and ψ
dihedral angles (Table S3). 1b and 1c show similar type II β-turn structures
(Figure 1). DFT calculations
revealed the β-turn structures in these azapeptides in the solid
state too (Figure S1).

are shown. Dashed pink lines highlight the intramolecular hydrogen
bond indicative of the β-turn.

To gain insight into the conformational properties of these
azapeptides
in aqueous solutions, NMR studies were carried out. Temperature coefficients
of chemical shifts of the −NH protons have been proposed to
predict intramolecular hydrogen bonding in water.7,16 We
thus recorded variable-temperature 1H NMR spectra in 95:5
H2O–CD3OD (v/v, Figure 2). With all of the three azapeptides 1a–1c, the chemical shift of the thioureido −NHd proton (Figure 1) showed a more positive temperature coefficient than −4.5
ppb/°C (Table 1), the criterion value for intramolecular hydrogen bonding in proteins/peptides.17,18 In contrast, those of −NHa, −NHb, and −NHc protons exhibited more negative values,
suggesting that they do not take part in the intramolecular hydrogen
bonding. The temperature coefficients of the chemical shift thus suggested
intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the thioureido −NHd in 1a, 1b, and 1c in aqueous
conditions, as shown in the crystal structures. Moreover, the proton
−NHd in 1a and 1b exhibited
substantially more positive temperature coefficients (−2.5
and −2.6 ppb/°C, respectively) than 1c (−4.0
ppb/°C), implying that the hydrogen bonding of the β-turn
in 1a and 1b is stronger than that in 1c (Table 1). This difference can be explained by the lower acidity of the thioureido
−NHd proton in 1c than that in 1a and 1b inferred from their chemical shifts
(Table S4). The urea counterparts of 1a, 1b, and 1c (2a, 2b, and 2c, Scheme 1), the classic azapeptides, showed more negative
temperature coefficients of the chemical shift of the ureido −NHd proton (−6.9, −6.7, and −6.5 ppb/°C,
respectively, Figure S2), suggesting much
less or absence of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding and the turn
conformation in aqueous solutions.7,17,18 Therefore, the amidothiourea moiety exhibited a significantly
enhanced promotion of the β-turn structure in short azapeptides
in aqueous solutions, compared to that of the urea counterpart in
the classic azapeptides.19−22 This is likely due to the lower acidity of the ureido
−NHd proton in ureas than that of the thioureido
−NHd proton in thioureas (Table S4).12 The acidity of the thioureido
−NH proton thus appears to play a key role in promoting the
turn conformation of the short azapeptides to remain in aqueous solutions
as well. Moreover, the chemical shift of the thioureido −NHd proton in amidothiourea 1a is less responsive
to change in the H2O content in H2O–CD3CN binary solvent than that of ureido −NHd proton in amidourea 2a (Figure S3). Similar observations were made with 1b over 2b and 1c over 2c (Figure S4). These again suggest a higher intramolecular hydrogen
bonding capacity of the thioureido −NHd proton in
the amidothiourea under aqueous conditions.

spectra in H2O.

Two-dimensional NOESY spectra were also recorded for 1a in aqueous solutions (Figure S5). The
−CH3 proton Hg showed cross-peaks with
phenyl −CHf and thioureido −NHd (Figure 2d), despite
being located at the two distant terminuses of the molecule. This
directly supports the folded conformation of 1a in aqueous
solution, as shown in the crystal (the Hg–Hf distance is 3.253 Å, whereas the Hg–Hd distance is 4.046 Å). The observed NOE signals for −CHe and −NHd again supported the folded β-turn
structure of 1a in aqueous solutions (3.613 Å for
He–Hd in the crystal). The −NHb and −NHc protons are active for proton
exchange and not protected by the intramolecular hydrogen bonding,
and their NOE signals were not observed. The NMR studies in aqueous
solutions therefore confirmed the folded conformation.

CD spectra
in H2O were next investigated. CD signals
at 215 and 250 nm were observed for 1a, 1b, and 1c. The signal at 250 nm is assigned to the π–π*
transition of the achiral phenylthiourea chromophore at the C terminal
of the molecule, according to the absorption spectra (Figure 3).23,24 This observation confirmed that the chirality of the amino acid
residue is transferred to the distant achiral phenylthiourea chromophore.
β-Turn structures were thus proposed in these azapeptides in
water that bring the achiral chromophore into the hydrogen bonding
network containing the chiral center, allowing the long-distance communication
of the asymmetric conformational information. The phenylthiourea chromophore
thus operates as a CD reporter for the β-turn structure.8

Figure 3 Absorption (a) and CD (b) spectra of 1a, 1b, and 1c in H2O. [1a] = [1b] = [1c] = 40 μM.

As the CD response of the phenylthiourea chromophore
was induced
by the β-turn conformation afforded by the intramolecular hydrogen
bonding, the intensity of the CD signal was expected to reflect the
strength of the hydrogen bonding.25 Indeed, 1a and 1b in H2O showed stronger induced
CD signals at 250 nm than 1c (Figure 3). The g factor values23 calculated from the absorption and CD spectra
(Figure S6) exhibited a similar tendency
that the g factor values at 250 nm for 1a and 1b (−10.6 × 10–5)
are larger than those of 1c (−7.1 × 10–5). These observations suggest that the hydrogen bonding
in 1a and 1b are similar, while being stronger
than that in 1c, reminiscent of the conclusion made with
the temperature coefficients of the chemical shifts (Table 1). To keep the same solvent
conditions for the variable-temperature NMR experiments, absorption
and CD spectra were also recorded in 95:5 H2O–MeOH
(v/v, Figure S7). We observed CD profiles
and g factors (Figure S8) similar to those in H2O. The concentration-independent
CD and 1H NMR spectra of 1c exclude the possible
contribution of the intermolecular interactions in aqueous solutions
(Figures S9 and S10).7

The folded β-turn structures of the three nonclassic
azapeptides
were also confirmed in the organic solvent CH3CN. CD signals
at 235 and 270 nm were observed and assigned to the chiral amino acid
residue and the achiral phenylthiourea chromophore, respectively (Figure 4),8 which points to their β-turn conformation in this
organic solvent. The chemical shift of the thioureido −NHd proton was found to be reluctant to the change of the temperature
(Figure S11), with a more positive temperature
coefficient than those of the −NHa, −NHb, and −NHc protons (Table 2). The 2D NOESY spectra of 1a in CD3CN exhibited cross-peaks of the −CHe proton with −NHa and −NHb and with −NHc and −NHd as well
(Figure S12), indicative of the folded
conformation. Moreover, the obvious NOE signals for CHe–NHb and NHb–NHd are
consistent with the type II β-turn structure and agree with
those shown in the crystal structure of 1a.22 The temperature coefficients of -NHd protons and g factors at 270 nm (Figure S13) indicated a similar strength of the intramolecular
hydrogen bonding in 1a and 1b, but which
is stronger than that in 1c (Table 2).

Conclusions
In summary, β-turn structures were shown in aqueous solutions
in a series of acyl amino acid-based N-amidothioureas
(the nonclassic azapeptides) and in the solid-state and organic solvent.
Our findings afford a facile structural framework for folded short
peptides in aqueous solutions that could be readily probed by a simple
spectral reporter. The amidothiourea moiety operates like a proline
residue in the peptide backbone to promote the folded conformation.
This is of significance because the classic short azapeptides, or
the urea counterparts of the current peptide-based N-amidothioureas, did not exhibit turn structures in aqueous solutions.19−22 Work is now under way to validate the generality of the present
strategy for establishing the folded β-turn conformation in
aqueous solutions and to explore the potential impact of such amidothiourea
moiety when inserted into peptides or proteins.
