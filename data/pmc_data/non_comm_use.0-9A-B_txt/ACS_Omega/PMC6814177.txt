Insulin
receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is one of the major substrates
for the IR, and their interaction mediates several downstream insulin
signaling pathways. In this study, we have identified three novel
mutations in the IRS1 gene of type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients, which
reflected in the amino acid changes as I65S, R66S, and G86R in the
phosphotyrosine binding domain of the IRS1 protein. The impact of
these mutations on the structure and function of the IRS1 protein
was evaluated through molecular modeling studies, and distinct conformational
fluctuations were recorded. The variable binding affinities and positional
displacement of these mutant models were observed in the ligand-binding
cleft of IR. The mutant IRS1 models triggered conformational changes
in the L1 domain of IR upon their binding. Such structural variations
in IRS1 and IR structures due to mutations resulted in variable molecular
interactions that could lead to altered insulin transduction, followed
by insulin resistance and T2D.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes (T2D)
is a late onset polygenic disease, which
is caused by relative rather than absolute insulin deficiency. Several
genes and their combinations of common variants contributing to the
risk of T2D have been identified using investigations of candidate
genes.1−3 Identification of disease susceptibility genes, which
leads to the T2D risk, is one of the major tasks as T2D results from
multiple complications. The genes which are thought to be involved
in the pancreatic cell function, insulin action/glucose metabolism,
and other metabolic conditions are considered as candidate genes for
identifying the disease susceptibility genes.4,5 So
far, no single gene mutation has been identified as sole contributor
to cause T2D.6−10 Several genes such as inwardly rectifying potassium channel (KIR6.2),
insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), sulfonylurea receptor (SUR-1),
glucokinase (GK), insulin (INS), fatty acid binding protein (FABP2),
LPL (lipoprotein lipase), and so on were reported to be associated
with the risk of developing T2D.9−12

In the present study, we aimed on the IRS1
gene, which plays a
key role in downstream signaling of insulin and insulin-like growth
factors (IGFs). IRS1 transmits the signals from insulin and insulin
growth factors (IGFs) to P13K/Akt and Erk map kinase pathways and
plays an important role in the metabolic and mitogenic functions.13−15 Perturbations in IRS1 complexes may lead to the progression of insulin
resistance and T2D as IRS1 plays a central role in the insulin metabolism.
Earlier, it has been reported that the G972R mutation in the IRS1
gene has shown to impair its function and also to be associated with
coronary artery disease (CAD). This mutation was observed to be highly
significant with insulin resistance in the T2D patients, and the frequency
of the G972R mutation was found to be higher among the patients with
CAD. This mutation greatly increases the risk of CAD in obese patients
having abnormalities in the insulin resistance syndrome. This represents
that such mutations in the IRS1 gene can be used as genetic markers
to predict the risk of CAD in T2D patients.16 Experimental studies in mice with combined IR and IRS1 mutations
showed that IRS1 is an important factor to mediate the action of insulin
in peripheral tissues and the mutant IRS1 induced T2D in the experimental
models. The IRS1 mutant models were specifically observed to develop
severe insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver, with compensatory
β-cell hyperplasia. This indicates that insulin resistance is
tissue-specific in vivo with IRS1 mutations.17 IRS1 forms signaling complexes with IR and several intracellular
signaling partners that act as key networks and link the intracellular
machinery with the plasma membrane. IRS1 contains two domains such
as pleckstrin homology and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains,
through which it interacts with IR and IGF 1 receptor.18,19 IRS1 is a major substrate for IR and implicated in the insulin signaling
pathways where a cytoplasmic protein is rapidly phosphorylated by
receptor tyrosine kinases at multiple tyrosine residues in the PTB
domain, which is followed by autophosphorylation of IR. The tyrosine-phosphorylated
IRS1 then interacts with a variety of partners among which the major
one is IR.20−23 Because IRS1 is the key mediator, the regulation of interaction
between IRS1 and IR is considered to be primarily important for the
insulin signaling.24 Abnormal protein–protein
interactions involving IRS1 with its interacting partners such as
IR may interfere with altered insulin transduction and lead to insulin
resistance and T2D. Several variants in the coding region of the IRS1
gene have been reported to contribute to the susceptibility of T2D.25−33 These variants cause altered functioning of IRS1 and affect its
interaction with its major interacting partner, IR. The responsible
factors for the invariable interactions due to IRS1 mutations are
to be delineated, and their molecular mechanism is also to be determined.
Earlier studies reported that the presence of natural mutations in
the IRS1 gene is responsible for decreased interaction with IR and
leads to the development of insulin resistance and T2D.34 However, the molecular basis behind the development
of T2D due to invariable interactions between IRS1 and IR has not
been explained so far. In this concurrence, we aimed to screen the
mutations in the IRS1 gene in a population of T2D patients and projected
to predict the mechanism of their interaction and variable factors
in the mutant condition when compared to the wild type. We have carried
out the similar kind of study where we identified the impact of mutations
in the GK gene and explained their consequences, leading to T2D through
molecular modeling studies.35 Such encouraging
results and the availability of crystal structures of IRS1 and IR
in the protein data bank (PDB) database helped us to step forward
to find out the significant factors responsible for their interactions
under wild-type and mutated conditions.

Results and Discussion
Identification
of Mutations
Agarose gel electrophoretic
analysis of isolated genomic DNA showed sharp bands below the wells,
which indicates the well integrity of isolated genomic DNA (Supporting Information, Figure S5). Amplified
products when run on 2% agarose gel showed a 400 bp product, which
was evident when compared with a molecular marker (Figure 1). The genetic analysis of
the IRS1 gene in 30 T2D patients revealed that one patient showed
T–G transversion and two patients showed G–C transversions
at different locations. No mutations were observed in the remaining
patients and normal controls. These nucleotide changes reflected as
I–S, R–S, and G–R amino acid changes. The identified
mutations, change in codons, and the respective change in the amino
acids along with their positions in the IRS1 protein are shown in
the Supporting Information (Table S1),
and the corresponding sequence alignments are represented in Figure 2. So far, several
mutations have been identified in the IRS1 gene and were reported
to contribute a high risk of T2D and obesity.23−31 Although these mutations and their physiological impact have been
reported in the earlier studies, their molecular mechanism and structural
basis behind the development of T2D due to IRS1 mutations have not
been reported so far. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to predict
the structural variations at the molecular level that are aroused
because of mutations through molecular modeling studies. We found
three novel mutations in the current study such as I65S, R66S, and
G86R, and we have characterized them to know their impact on the IRS1
protein conformational changes and its invariable molecular interactions
with its interacting partners especially IR.

In Silico Characterization
of Mutations
The wild-type
model of IRS1 was obtained from PDB, and it was used as a reference
model to study the effect of mutations on the protein conformation
so that its pathogenicity can be predicted. Introduction of mutation
into the wild-type model and generation of the mutated IRS1 structures
will not justify the answer where the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
will play a major role in estimating the probabilities of how far
the mutated structures will behave in the diabetic patients with mutations
in the IRS1 gene, thereby contributing to the pathogenicity. Hence,
we have performed 50 000 ps MD protocol to observe the behavior
of mutated IRS1 structures when compared with the wild-type model.
Initially, all the models were optimized, refined, and subjected to
simulations. The simulated structures showed the best stereochemical
quality validated by using Ramachandran plots where all the residues
of wild-type and mutant IRS1 structures were observed to fall in the
allowed regions only (Supporting Information, Figures S6–S9). The energy levels and conformational variations
of the structures were given major priority, which are the major factors
that will affect the reactivity and behavior of IRS1. The MD simulations
revealed some interesting points about the mutated structures, that
is, initially, the total energy (potential + kinetic) plot of the
IRS1 structures revealed that the wild-type IRS1 tend to be stabilized
at the energy levels of 1400 kcal/mol and was found to be in a stable
condition throughout the 50 000 ps simulation period. However,
these energy levels were reduced to 1300 kcal/mol in the three mutated
IRS1 structures at the starting phase of simulation and continued
to be stabilized at the same value up to 50 000 ps (Figure 3). Further, there
also exist clear-cut fluctuations in the root-mean-square deviation
(rmsd) ranges of mutated IRS1 structures when compared to wild type
(Figure 4). The wild-type
model showed fluctuations up to 40 000 ps, and after that,
it started to stabilize at a range of 5.8 Å. However, this case
is completely different for the mutated structures where all the three
mutated structures showed fluctuations in initial stages only and
they started to stabilize further, but surprisingly around different
rmsd ranges. The I65S-mutated IRS1 model stabilized around 6.8 Å,
R66S around 4.5 Å, and G86R around 7.2 Å. Further, the final
conformations at the end of the simulation period were superimposed
together, and the rmsd matrix showed that there exist huge rmsd variations
(Figure 5).

Figure 3 Total energy
transitions of wild-type and mutated IRS1 models during
50 000 ps simulation period. Further, there exist clear-cut
fluctuations in the rmsd ranges of mutated IRS1 structures also when
compared to wild type.

from the rmsd matrix indicate the extent of rmsd variation among the
structures. The blue to red color indicates the increasing rate of
variation in rmsd.

Observation of conformational
elements from PDBsum analysis revealed
that there is a loss of one sheet in the R66S-mutated structure and
a loss of three beta hair pins and one strand in the G86R structure.
The wild-type model has only one helical element in its structure,
and this element has been lost in the G86R structure and an additional
helix was formed in the R66S-mutated structure. Variations were also
observed in the number of beta bulges, beta turns, and gamma turns
(Supporting Information, Table S2). It
is clear from these observations that the mutations may not affect
the energy levels, but there are considerable variations in the conformation
of the protein. There exists a clear spatial restraint in the orientation
of the conformational elements after mutations, which is evident from
the PDBsum and rmsd observations. Such conformational fluctuations
result in the altered activity of the protein, causing the pathogenic
condition in the patients with mutations in the IRS1 gene. Finally,
it could be said that MD studies pave the best way to expel the effect
of the mutation on the protein conformation and catalysis through
in silico means within a very less span of time and also the cost
of the experimental analysis can be reduced to maximum extent.49 This study may need to be investigated furthermore,
where the variation in its activity is to be revealed, so that the
molecular basis for the T2D condition due to IRS1 mutations could
be cleared. Hence, the current study was progressed to find out its
intermolecular interactions with its major interacting partner IR
in both wild-type and mutated conditions so that the variable and
responsible factors will be identified, which could be even plausible
factors disturbing the insulin signaling network.

MD simulations
were also carried out for the IR structure to get
reliable binding poses during the docking process. The simulation
results of IR showed that the structure was stabilized at an energy
level of 9500 kcal/mol and an rmsd of 3 Å. The lowest energy
conformation was taken for performing protein–protein docking
studies with the IRS1 protein. The energy and rmsd plots of the IR
structure generated during 50 000 ps simulation period are
provided in the Supporting Information (Figures S10 and S11).

Protein–Protein
Docking Studies of IRS1 and IR
The protein–protein
docking study was successfully implemented
between the stabilized structures of IRS1 and IR using Z-dock module
of Discovery Studio. One hundred top pose clusters were generated
from each docking process with a total of 2000 poses. Among all the
poses, the dock conformation with the best Z-dock score and Z-rank
score was considered for the interpretation of the results. We have
observed some noteworthy results with the docking scores of IRS1 wild-type
and mutated structures against the IR protein. Analyses of Z-dock
scores revealed that the wild-type IRS1 dock pose showed a docking
score of 15.72 kcal/mol. According to the Z-dock algorithm of Discovery
Studio, the higher the docking score, the higher will be the strength
of the complex. The Z-rank scores evaluate the top poses in the top
cluster of each docking process, and the lowest Z-rank score indicates
the best docked pose among the total poses. Such top poses with the
lowest Z-rank scores will be having the highest dock score in such
a cluster and indicate to consider that pose with the lowest Z-rank
and the highest Z-dock score. When compared to the docking score of
the wild-type IRS1 docking pose, all the mutant IRS1 docked poses
such as I65S, R66S, and G86R showed increased docked scores of 15.74,
20.30, and 18.06 kcal/mol (Supporting Information, Table S3). These docking scores were observed to be surprising
where the presence of each mutation increases the interaction with
IR, where among all, R66S showed the highest Z-dock score. It could
be predicted from these Z-dock scores that these mutations may be
responsible for the increased binding of IRS1 with IR, making its
dissociation a bit complicated so that it may be unavailable for further
interacting partners to proceed for next downstream steps in the insulin
signaling pathway.

The interactions between IRS1 and IR were
not only defined in terms of affinities based on Z-dock scores, but
also the orientations and intermolecular interactions were analyzed
in wild-type and mutated conditions. Before discussing the orientation
of IRS1 structures with IR, it is necessary to know the structural
organization of IRS1 and IR proteins. The IRS1 protein taken in this
study is the PTB domain, which is a single A chain containing two
alpha helices and eight beta strands.50 The PDBsum analysis of IRS1 showed that it contains a protein interface
binding domain formed with Leu208, Met209, Asn210, Ile211, Arg212,
Arg213, Cys214, Gly215, His216, Ser217, Phe222, Gly226, Arg227, Leu254,
Met257, Arg258, Met260, and Ser261 residues. These residues are known
to be involved in protein–protein interactions forming nonbonded
interactions (Figure 6A). IR contains six domains in its structure such as L1 (leucine-rich
repeat 1), CR (cysteine-rich), L2 (leucine-rich repeat 2), FnIII-1
(fibronectin-type III-1), FnIII-2 (fibronectin-type III-2) and FnIII-3
(fibronectin-type III-3) organized in a V-shape manner among which
the first three domains form one leg of V and another three domains
form another leg of V. The N-terminus of the IR protein starts with
the L1 domain, and the FnIII-3 domain ends with the C-terminus. L2
and FnIII-1 domains join the two legs of the V shape at its apex (Figure 6B). A high-affinity
state of IR is formed by the rearrangement of these domains, which
results in trans-phosphorylation of intracellular kinases and binding
of other regulatory partners such as IRS1. The ligand-binding region
is accomplished by the extensive interaction between L1 and CR domains
and the rigidity of FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 domains. Potential rearrangements
and movements occur at the junctions of CR-L2, L2–FnIII-1,
and FnIII-1–FnIII-2 domains. The apex of the V shape possessing
L2 and FnIII-1 does not have any extensive contact areas as most of
their molecular surface areas are buried inside the apex. The region
ahead of these two domains in the V shape offers the interaction site
to bind with the interacting partners.51

domains along with the ligand-binding area.

Such an extensive availability of experimental information
made
us to strengthen our predicted interactions among IR and IRS1 wild-type
and mutant structures. As a standard reference, we initially observed
the molecular interactions formed in the docking complex of wild-type
IRS1–IR. The IRS1 structure formed 10 hydrogen bonds and 3
π-interactions with the IR protein. The residues such as pro158,
lys171, gln175, asn198, ser199, glu200, and ser261 from IRS1 were
found to form hydrogen bond interactions with ser290, glu355, ala356,
phe518, pro617, and ser619 residues of IR, whereas the residues such
as met156, phe160, and cys186 from IRS1 formed π-interactions
with phe518 and trp559 residues of IR. IRS1 was observed to form the
contact surface area of 623.36 Å2 with the IR contact
surface area of 625.47 Å2 at the binding cleft. With
such interactions, IRS1 was being held in the center of two legs of
the IR structure contacting the CR domain at one side and both FnIII-1
and FnIII-2 domains at the other side. This orientation and molecular
interactions of the IRS1 wild-type model in IR were compared and correlated
with mutated conditions (Figure 7 and Supporting Information, Table S4).

Figure 7 Binding mode orientations of IRS1 wild-type, I65S, R66S,
and G86R
mutant structures (green) with IR (red). The contacting surfaces are
represented as spheres among both the structures. The variations in
the position of IRS1 may be observed in the mutated condition when
compared to wild type.

The binding orientations of IRS1 mutants were found to be
variable
with the IR when compared to wild-type IRS1. The number of hydrogen
bonds was increased in the mutated structures where I65S, R66S, and
G86R formed 11, 12, and 14 hydrogen bonds, respectively. The residue
gln175 from the I65S mutant was found to commonly form hydrogen bonding
as observed in wild-type IRS1 but with a different residue from IR.
All the remaining hydrogen bonds in three mutant IRS1 structures were
found to be formed by completely different residues when compared
to the wild-type IRS1 model. Further, the interacting residues from
IR were also observed to be different to the residues interacting
with wild-type IRS1. This indicated the existence of a variable hydrogen
bonding pattern between IR and IRS1 mutant models.

Further consideration
of π-bond interactions was also found
to be variable when compared to wild-type IRS1. No residues were found
to form similar kind of π-bonds that were observed in the wild-type
IRS1 docking pose. The surface area contacts made in the I65S IRS1–IR
docking complex were found to be reduced when compared to the wild-type
IRS1–IR docking complex, whereas it was greatly increased in
R66S- and G86R-mutated IRS1–IR docking complexes. Such variations
in the binding mode of IRS1 mutant models made them to exist in different
orientations in the IR ligand-binding region. The I65S mutant IRS1
was observed to move toward the linking region of FnIII-1 and FnIII-2
domains where the R66S and G86R mutant models were observed in completely
different orientations when compared to wild-type IRS1. These both
mutant models shifted toward the CR domain of IR. In addition to this,
the L1 domain of IR was also observed to interact with R66S- and G86R-mutated
IRS1 structures. Positional variation in the L1 domain of IR was observed
in the docking poses of R66S and G86R IRS1 mutants where the domain
was slightly moved toward the IRS1 structure inside the cleft of V-shape.
These conformational variations observed in the IRS1 structure due
to mutations could be the responsible factors for the variable docking
scores and altered binding mode orientations within the IR ligand-binding
region. Finally, all such variations contributing to the invariable
interactions of IRS1 and IR disturb the insulin signaling pathway.

Conclusions
In this work, we have identified three novel
mutations in the IRS1
gene, viz., I65S, R66S, and G86R, in a population of T2D patients.
The impact of these mutations on the IRS1 structural conformation
was studied, and the variable factors were identified in terms of
rmsd and conformational elements. The mutant IRS1 models showed variable
binding energies with IR and triggered conformational variations in
the IR structure especially in the L1 domain. Variable binding mode
orientations of mutant IRS1 structures were observed in the ligand-binding
region of the IR structure, resulting in their positional displacement.
All these factors could be responsible for the variable interaction
of IRS1 and IR, resulting in altered insulin transduction, leading
to the development of T2D. This study had explained at its best and
provided a probable molecular mechanism behind the development of
T2D in the people with mutations in the IRS1 gene.

Retrieval of Gene Sequence and Primer Designing
The
IRS1 gene sequence was retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) (ID: 3667), the PTB domain was taken as the target, and primers
were designed spanning the coding region of about 400 bp (forward:
5′GGGAGGACTTGAGCTACGG3′; reverse: 5′GGGTTAGAGCAGTTGGACGA3′).
Primers were verified for secondary structures and primer–dimer
formation by using the Sigma DNA Calculator (http://www.sigma-genosys.com/calc/DNACalc.asp), and the designed primers were synthesized from Europhins Pvt.
Ltd, India.

Sample Collection
Whole blood samples
of 10 normal
and 30 T2D patients were obtained from CKS Teja Hospital, Tirupati,
India. The samples were stored at 4 °C in a refrigerator temporarily
and used for the isolation of genomic DNA. Sequence data have been
deposited at NCBI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/under accession numbers: AHG12642.1, AHG12643.1, AHG12644.1 of IRS1, partial (Homo sapiens).

Isolation Genomic DNA from Blood
Genomic DNA was isolated
from whole blood samples by a salting-out method as per the protocol
of Lahiri et al.36 Concentration and purity
of the obtained DNA were estimated by spectrophotometric analysis,
and the integrity of DNA was analyzed by running agarose gel electrophoresis.

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

1 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The obtained PCR
products were sent for sequencing to Bio Corporals Pvt. Ltd, Chennai,
India.

Sequence Analysis and Identification of Mutations
The
obtained IRS1 gene sequences of normal and T2D patients were subjected
to sequence alignment using ClustalX tool37 where ungapped alignment was carried out and the mismatch regions
were identified, which represent the change in the nucleotides. Further,
the nucleotide sequences were translated into protein sequences, again
ungapped alignment was carried out and the change in amino acid residues
was identified.

In Silico Characterization of Mutations
Three mutations
I65S, R66S, and G86R were identified from three T2D patients and subjected
to in silico characterization where the effect of each mutation on
the IRS1 protein was studied individually. The NMR-resolved structure
of the IRS1 protein was retrieved from the PDB (ID: 1IRS) and loaded into
molecular operating environment (MOE) software.38 The ligand groups and hetero atoms such as IL-4 receptor
phosphopeptide present in the structure were removed, and hydrogen
atoms were added to the structure. Protonation was done, followed
by energy minimization in MMFF94x39−44 force field to an rms gradient of 0.05. This energy-minimized structure
was used to generate the mutated structures by introducing the mutations
I65S, R66S, and G86R at their respective locations. The energy minimization
process was iterated with the same conditions, and finally, the optimized
mutated structures were obtained. The energy-minimized conformations
of wild-type and mutated IRS1 structures were subjected to MD simulations
individually in the same force field.45 The NPT (number of particles, pressure, and temperature)
statistical ensemble was specified by fixing the temperature and pressure
with constant values. Nose–Poincare–Anderson algorithm
was specified, and the temperature was started at 30 K and increased
to 300 K during the run time. The heat time was set to 30 picoseconds
(ps), followed by the equilibration of the system for 1000 ps, and
the production time of simulations was carried out for 50 000
ps in an implicit solvent environment. The total energy and rmsd values
of each conformation were plotted as a graph to observe and correlate
the energy variations among wild-type and mutated IRS1 conformations.

The detailed structural analyses of all the simulated structures
were studied using PDBsum web interface.46,47 The stabilized conformations of wild-type and mutated IRS1 structures
obtained at the end phase of the production period of MD simulations
were submitted to PDBsum, and the conformational variations were identified,
which are due to respective mutations in the structure. The conformational
variations were measured and correlated in terms of sheets, β-hairpins,
β-bulges, strands, helices, β-turns, and γ-turns,
which they contained in their conformations. All the mutated IRS1
structures were superimposed with the wild-type IRS1 model, and the
variations in the rmsd values were represented as a matrix.

Protein–Protein
Docking Studies
All the low-energy-stabilized
conformations of wild-type and mutated IRS1 structures obtained at
the end phase of the production period of the MD simulations were
used to perform protein–protein docking studies against the
IR protein. This step is anticipated to identify the binding mode
of the IRS1 structure under wild-type and different mutated conditions
so that the effect of each mutation on the reactivity of IRS1 could
be revealed out. Prior to the docking process, the IR structure was
processed and prepared where the X-ray crystal structure of IR was
obtained from PDB (ID: 2DTG) at a resolution of 3.80 Å. This structure is
a dimer and found to have fab fragments. While processing the structure,
fab fragments, water molecules, and other hetero atoms were removed
and subjected to protonation, followed by energy minimization. The
energy-minimized structure was further subjected to MD simulations
in MOE with the same conditions used for the simulations of the IRS1
structure, and the finally obtained IR conformation was used for docking
studies.

Molecular docking between IRS1 (wild type and three
mutants) and IR was carried out individually using the Z-dock module
of Discovery Studio v.4.0. Initially, IRS1 and IR structures were
loaded in the Discovery Studio working space, and the IR structure
was set as the receptor and IRS1 structures as ligands. Four individual
docking reactions were carried out for wild-type, I65S, R66S, and
G86R mutants, respectively, against the IR protein. A rigid body docking
method was used with an angular step size of 6 Å for the rotational
sampling of IRS1 orientations. A distance cutoff value of 10 Å
was specified, and a maximum of 2000 docked poses were generated in
each docking process. The poses were ranked using the Z-rank algorithm
that includes detailed electrostatics, van der Waals, and desolvation
energy terms.48 The top poses were grouped
into 100 maximum clusters with an rmsd cutoff of 10 Å and an
interface cutoff of 10 Å. After the docking process, the largest
cluster with top poses was taken, and the pose with the best Z-rank
and Z-dock score was saved. The intermolecular interactions formed
in the docking complexes of IRS1 and IR were analyzed by protein interface
analysis module of Discovery Studio where hydrogen bonds, π-bonds,
and salt bridges were analyzed along with the interacting amino acid
residues. Further, the contacting interface areas of IRS1 and IR in
the docking complexes were also determined.
