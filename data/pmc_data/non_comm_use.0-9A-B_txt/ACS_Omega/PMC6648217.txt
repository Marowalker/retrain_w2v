Topological insulating
materials with dissipationless surface states
promise potential applications in spintronic materials. Through density
functional theory, we proposed a new class of topological phase transition
in Sb2Mg3 on the basis of tensile strain. At
the equilibrium state, Sb2Mg3 corresponds to
a normal insulator, and under the influence of tensile strain, the
band gaps are gradually tuned. At ε = 7.2%, the nontrivial phase
is achieved due to spin–orbital coupling (SOC), and a nontrivial
topological phase band gap of 0.22 eV is opened. As a result, the
Dirac cone is locked in the bulk, which is associated to px,y band crossing. Interestingly,
the tuning of nontrivial topological properties with tensile strain
leading to spin saturation indicates an orbital-filtering effect.
The surface state of the Sb2Mg3 material is
determined by the topological invariant, Z2 = 1, at the critical tensile strain in the presence of the SOC effect.
This study enhances the scope of topological insulators and current
platforms to design new spintronic devices.

1 Introduction
The
emergence of topological insulators (TIs) initiated a new concept
to pursue nontrivial topological phases in quantum materials, especially
in the band theory of quantum solids.1−3 The novel applications
have motivated the search for new materials exhibiting topological
properties, for which new theoretical insights are required. Subsequently,
several techniques such as doping or changing of the composition,
pressure, strain, and electric field have been used to control topological
phase transition in materials.

Topological systems promise interesting
applications, such as better
catalysts or new magnetic storage media and more energy-efficient
microelectronic components.4−7 Several attractive new classes of topological materials
have been discovered, including topological crystalline insulators
(TCIs) and topological insulators (TIs), and were achieved by SOC-induced
parity inversion of the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB)
as a guiding principle.8−12 Contrarily, Dirac semimetals (DSMs) touch the Fermi level in the
band structure calculation.13−17 The bulk band gap of nontrivial topology can be closed, and therefore,
the energy level of the topologically protected metallic bulk states
is critical in a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT). This
has been enhanced by tuning an intrinsic material property such as
SOC interaction by chemical doping or alloying of the composition.18−21 For instance, a phase change from the nontrivial phase to the trivial
phase has been carried out in TIBiSe2–xSx22,23 and Hg1–xCdxTe.24 Such a nontrivial phase can also be obtained
using an external pressure without the explicit requirement of alloying
or doping. This approach avoids the problem of unwanted inhomogeneity
and defects typically arising due to alloying. Therefore, it has become
an attractive method for examining quantum phase changes in TIs. Recently,
topological phase transitions have been observed in several materials
by applying tensile strain modification.25−29 Pressure leading to nontrivial phase transition has
been reported in polar semiconductors BiTeBr30 and BiTeI,31 rocksalt chalcogenides,32 Pb1–xSnxSe,33 and layered
materials.34

For experimental observation
of the topological phase transition
through detection of the gapless metallic surface states, angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy
are utilized. Unfortunately, observing the surface state at high pressure
using ARPES is difficult, thereby making it experimentally challenging
to investigate hydrostatic pressure or quantum phase transitions in
TIs that can be obtained by applying strain. Furthermore, first-principles
studies add an achievable alternative to explore the existence of
such phase transitions and also to characterize unique surface states
through simulations. Therefore, there has been renewed interest in
theoretically probing strain-induced topological phase transitions
in topological materials.

In this article, based on density
functional theory calculations,
we report topological phase changes in Sb2Mg3. This material is a normal insulator at the equilibrium state, and
its band gap decreases under induced tensile strain. Hence, the material
transforms into a Dirac semimetal without SOC at applied ε =
7.2%. In the presence of SOC, the band gap reopens under the influence
of time reversal-invariant momenta.

2 Results
and Discussion
An alkali-metal antimonide class of compounds
has gained attention
due to its potential exotic physical properties. Sb2Mg3 crystallizes both in hexagonal and cubic bixbyite structures.
The α-phase is the high-temperature phase with 80 atoms in the
unit cell (32 Sb and 48 Mg) prototypical of La2O3.35,36 Under ∼1200 K, with the unit cell
consisting of five atoms (two Sb and three Mg), the α-phase
transitions to a β-phase structure.37 The optimized lattice parameter for the hexagonal phase of Sb2Mg3 is a = b =
4.61 Å and c = 7.27 Å, as illustrated in Figure 1a, with two Sb and
three Mg atoms in the unit cell. The cohesive energy of Sb2Mg3 described as the difference between the energy of
the free three Mg and two Sb atoms and the total energy of Sb2Mg3 in the solid phase is calculated to be −0.752
eV. Furthermore, the stability of this crystal is confirmed by phonon
dispersion along the bulk Brillouin zone (Figure 1b), in which the nonappearance of the imaginary
frequency indicates that the material is dynamically stable, as presented
in Figure 1c. Since
the primitive cell contains five atoms, a factor group analysis leads
to 15 vibrational modes at the Γ point, of which 12 are optical
modes and 3 are acoustic modes.38 Moreover,
we performed ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at 300
and 500 K with a 4 × 4 × 4 supercell under periodic boundary
conditions for 10 ps with a time step of 1.0 fs. The temperature versus
time graph remains the same for variations between 290 and 310 K at
300 K.

Bulk and projected surface Brillouin zones. The four TRI points are
Γ(0, 0, 0), L(π, 0, 0), F(π, π, 0), and Z(π, π, π).
The hexagon indicates the 2D Brillouin zone of the projected (1, 1,
1) surface in which the high-symmetry k points Γ̅, K̅, and M̅ are labeled. (c)
Phonon dispersion along the bulk Brillouin zone.

The same observations have been found between 490 and 510
K at
500 K, as presented in Figure S1a,b. The
results show thermal stability for Sb2Mg3.

As plotted in Figure 2a, an indirect band gap of 0.43 eV is observed, where the VBM is
located at the Γ point and the CBM is found between Z and F of the bulk Brillouin zone. The
valley degeneracy is 2 for the CBM at the Z–F point, and the high valley degeneracy is 6 for the accurate
CBM at the CB point along the Z–Γ line.
Thus, n-type Sb2Mg3-based Zintl compounds are
confirmed to be high-performance thermoelectric materials with multiple
degenerate valleys and low lattice thermal conductivities.36,39 Spin–orbital coupling has no influence on the CB; however,
only a small reduction in the band gap and in the VB was observed,
as illustrated in Figure S2a,b.

Figure 2 Bulk band structures
of Sb2Mg3 calculated
using (a) PBE and (b) hybrid
Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) functionals at the equilibrium
state.

The hybrid HSE06 functional is
adopted to check the accuracy of
the band gap calculation, considering that the PBE functional generally
underestimates the band gap, as presented in Figure 2a,b, and the energy gap is calculated to
be 0.46 eV. It is particularly interesting that, for the band structure
without the inclusion of SOC, the VBM is mainly determined by the
Sb-pz orbitals related to the bands with
Sb-px,y, whereas the
CB has a (Mg)Sb-s orbital character with little influence on the band
structure by Sb-px,y orbitals,
as shown in Figure S3a–f. Therefore,
due to the negligible effect of SOC on the CB at equilibrium states
of the Sb2Mg3 crystal structure, SOC will not
have an effect on the band up to the critical tensile strain of the
quantum phase transition. The band gap at equilibrium corresponding
to the normal insulator can be tuned by applying tensile strain. Recent
studies on 3D TIs have identified several materials with tunable topological
phases.40,41 Upon varying the hydrostatic tensile stress
or strain parameters, these materials undergo a phase transition between
a normal insulator and a nontrivial phase. Such transition may occur
as a function of impurity doping, pressure, or temperature.42 Topological properties of Sb2Mg3 can be also changed by applying an external strain, thereby
breaking the symmetry. The electronic band structures of Sb2Mg3 get altered as a result of increasing external strain,
as shown in Figure 3a–e. We applied anisotropic strain in the range of [−7.2%,
7.2%], tuning the band around the Γ point (anisotropic strain
is more reasonable than the xy-plane strain, as shown
in Figure S4a–c). Not surprisingly,
for Sb2Mg3, at the lower tensile strain, the
material remains a normal insulator. Contrarily, the band gap increases
monotonically as compressive strain is applied. Hence, the band gap
reduction was achieved with increasing tensile strain.

(b) −4.5%, (c) 0%, (d) 3.2%,
(e) 4.5%, and (f) 7.2% strains on the band structures without SOC
calculations. The bands zoom at the Γ point of anisotropic strain-induced
Sb2Mg3.

From the partial orbital projection, the s, px,y, and pz orbital
order from the CBM to VBM near the Fermi level at the Γ point
remains the same with the SOC, as shown in Figure 3f. This feature can also be found in BiAs28 and SiGeCH3,29 which is in good agreement with previous works. When ε = 7.2%,
as presented in Figure 3f, Sb2Mg3 becomes gapless without SOC. Furthermore,
s–p orbital band inversion takes place at the Γ point.
The two px,y bands touch
each other at the Fermi level, as presented in Figure 3f, at ε = 7.2% without SOC, whereas
the s band moves down to the VB region, resulting in px,y, pz, and s orbital order. When SOC is included, the band structure of
the stretched Sb2Mg3 reopened, as shown in Figure 4b.

Figure 4 DFT-PBE bands are fitted
by tight-binding models (a) without and
(b) with SOC at ε = 7.2%. Note that red dotted lines show the
TB and blue solid lines refer to DFT-PBE.

As discussed above, at ε = 7.2% without the effect
of SOC,
the VB has major Sb-px,y and Sb-pz orbital contribution, whereas
the CB mainly is dominated by minor Sb-px,y orbitals, as shown in Figure S3f. When the SOC occurs, the band degeneracy is lifted as
a result of lack of inversion symmetry, and therefore, a global indirect
band gap is generated. At a critical tensile strain of 7.2%, Sb2Mg3 undergoes a transition from a trivial phase
to nontrivial phase. The band inversion of the opposite parities near
the Γ point clearly indicates that the resulting state is a
topological insulator. The states near the Fermi level are mainly
dominated by px,y orbitals,
although the s and pz orbitals are removed
from the Fermi level as a result of saturation, known as the orbital-filtering
effect.43−46 Noticeably, the SOC effect plays two crucial roles in the phase
change, namely, nontrivial gap opening and the band inversion between
px,y orbital states,
which are observed in Sb2Mg3, as presented in Figure 4a,b. The TB models
at ε = 7.2%, as illustrated in Figure 4a,b, without and with SOC respectively agree
with the PBE value. For applications based on spintronic device technology,
tunability of the spin splitting by the SOC effect and application
of strain have been realized in many materials. Large spin splitting
occurs along high-symmetry directions, and a typical Rashba effect
is observed at the Γ point.47,48

Since
the Bi2Se3 family has inversion symmetry,
the topological invariant can be easily calculated by the parity product
as guiding principles at high-symmetry points in the BZ.10 The topological nature of anisotropic strain-induced
Sb2Mg3 is determined by calculating the Z2 topological invariant using a tight-binding
model. For a lattice with inversion symmetry, the Z2 index can be concluded from the insight into the WCC,
as performed using the Z2 pack. The phase
change in Sb2Mg3 is achieved by calculating
the topological invariant on the basis of the U(2N) non-Abelian Berry
connection predicted by Yu and co-workers.49 Each of the nth occupied bands is indexed by |n, kx, ky⟩, and square matrix F(kx, ky) containing overlap
integers is defined as  

The unitary square complex can be solved as  where  represents the discrete spacing of Nx points along the kx direction. D(ky) is
a 2N × 2N matrix that has 2N eigenvalues  where θmD(ky) is the phase of the eigenvalues  

The Z2 topological invariant is determined
by counting the number of crossings between any arbitrary horizontal
reference line, and the evaluation of the WCC along any direction
in k space corresponds to the change in the phase
factor θ of the eigenvalues of the position operator projected
onto the occupied subspace. The odd number of crossings of any random
horizontal reference line in the case of ki = 0 (i = 1, 2, 3) with the evolution of θ
is characterized by a Z2 = 1 topological
insulator. The horizontal reference line indicates the odd number
of crossings, as shown in Figure 5a–c, confirming that Sb2Mg3 is a topological insulator (Z2 = 1:(111))
at ε = 7.2% with the presence of SOC, but for ki = 0.5 (i = 1, 2, 3), the evolution
lines never cross the reference line (normal insulator, Z2 = 0), as plotted in Figure S5b,d,f.

and i = 1, 2, 3. (d)
Momentum-resolved surface density of states subject to tensile strain
of 7.2%.

To explicitly show the nontrivial
topological phase features of
the surface states, we design an effective TB model on the basis of
s, px, py,
and pz orbitals and obtained the low-energy
spectrum of Sb2Mg3 by including the SOC interaction,
as shown in Figure 5d. The tight-binding model based on the maximally localized Wannier
functions (MLWFs) correctly reproduces the DFT band structures and
simulates the ARPES with the calculated surface density of states.
The surface densities of states with SOC are performed using an iterative
Green function method.

We notice that, out of all the bulk degrees
of freedom, only the
surface states inherit the electron spin. Energy dispersion in two
dimensions at ε = 7.2% is shown in Figure 5d. Analogous to the gapless edge states,
the spins of the surface carrier are locked to the direction of its
momentum. The surface state occurs in the middle of the gap between
the bulks and has a Dirac-like dispersion. The presence of topological
surface states is a substantial property of a topological insulator
having an insulating surface at ambient condition. Not only does it
serve as a strong evidence of the nontrivial topology, it also serves
directly as a bridge to the experiments.

Since the discovery
of nontrivial topology, looking for new topological
insulators has led to the search for binary heavy elements based on
small-energy-gap semiconductors. Herein, we propose one of the simplest
ways to realize a binary heavy element based on a closed-shell semiconductor
with an alkaline earth element.13,17,44,50,51 Investigations on Dirac materials are very interesting for quantum
property studies. Similarly, studies of stanene functionalized films,43,52 Nb2O3,53 arsenene,54 2D Mn-cyanogen,55 and Bi/Sb (111) films56 are in good agreement
with previous studies. We believe that our findings will not only
encourage existing experimental investigations but also pave the way
toward constructing a periodic table of topological materials. Experimentally,
a large strain may be difficult to achieve using traditional substrate
engineering. Nevertheless, the strain of 7.2% was applied in Sb2Mg3; in principle, one can easily realize a topological
insulator in future experiments.

3 Conclusions
In summary, topological phase transitions in Sb2Mg3 based on tensile strain is studied on the basis of density
functional theory calculations. Upon inducing tensile strain, Sb2Mg3 is shown to be a topological phase transition
at ε = 7.2% with SOC, creating an inverted band order. There
is also transition from a normal insulator to the Dirac semimetallic
state without SOC at critical tensile strain. These interesting results
make Sb2Mg3 a promising candidate material for
achieving a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator at room temperature.

4 Computational Methods
The electronic structure calculations
are performed using density
functional theory (DFT) by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package
(VASP) code.57 The core ion/electron was
obtained using projector-augmented wave (PAW)58 potential, and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation
functional was used.59,60 The relativistic effects were
included in the calculations with a plane-wave basis kinetic energy
cutoff of 400 eV, and the BZ was sampled by using a 5 × 5 ×
5 Monkhorst–Pack k-grid. The structure after the application
of strain was fully relaxed up to the convergence of forces being
less than 10–5 eV per unit cell and 0.005 eV Å–1, atomic position and cell parameters, respectively.
The band structures were calculated with and without SOC12 being applied in the self-consistent field (SCF).
The hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) functional
with 25% of the short-range exact exchange is used to account for
the underestimation of the band gap for the PBE functional.61 Phonon dispersion is performed using the PHONOPY62 code combined with the DFPT method in VASP.
The topological invariant identified by the Z2 number was determined by the method of WCC performed in a Z2 pack.63
