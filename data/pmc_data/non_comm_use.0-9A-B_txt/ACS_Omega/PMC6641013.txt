Research communities have been studying
materials with intermediate
bands (IBs) in the middle of the band gap to produce efficient solar
cells. Cells based on these materials could reach theoretical efficiencies
up to 63.2%. In this comprehensive study, we investigate by means
of accurate first-principle calculation the electronic band structure
of 2100 novel compounds (bulk materials) to discover whether the IB
is present in these materials. Our calculations are based on the density
functional theory, using the generalized-gradient approximation for
exchange and correlation terms and focusing on the band structure,
the density of states, and the electron effective masses of the structures
in the database. The IB structures are obtained by adding metallic
or semimetallic atoms in the bulk material. By means of these calculations,
we have clearly identified a number of compounds that may having high
potential to be used as photovoltaic materials. We present here the
numerical results for 17 novel IB materials, which could theoretically
prove to be suitable for photovoltaic applications.

Introduction
Multi-band gap materials
offer the possibility of increasing the
efficiency of solar cells beyond the limit of traditional single-band
gap solar-cell materials. Intermediate-band (IB) materials are characterized
by the splitting of the main band gaps into two or more sub-band gaps
by narrow IBs and have been the focus of recent studies.1,2 In IB solar cells, an IB material is sandwiched between two ordinary
p-type and n-type semiconductors and deed as discriminating contacts
to the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB), respectively.
In IB materials, an electron is promoted from the VB to the CB through
the IB. Upon absorption of sub-band gap-energy photons, the electrons
transit from VB to CB and later from IB to CB. It will add up to the
transition of electrons from VB to CB through conventional VB-to-CB
photon absorption.1,2 By adopting a hypothesis similar
to that of Shockley and Queisser,3 it was
shown in 19974 that balance-limiting efficiencies
of 63.2% for IB solar cells and 41% for single-band gap solar cells
can be achieved at a concentration of 46 050 suns at earth
and sun temperatures of 300 and 6000 K, respectively.

The IB
should be partially filled to permit the comparable rates
for the low sub-band gap-energy photon absorption processes and should
not overlap with either the VB or the CB to avoid fast transitions
through thermalizations.5 We can consider
the IB solar cells as a combination of three cells. Cells representing
VB-to-IB and IB-to-CB transitions can be regarded as two cells in
series, and the VB-to-CB transition can represent a parallel cell.
The cell will have a high tolerance to changes in the solar spectrum.6

In the mid-20th century, researchers7−10 suggested the concept of creating intermediate
levels in the middle of a forbidden band gap to increase the maximum
photocurrent by doping the semiconductor with a large concentration
of impurities. At an early stage, it was believed that these IBs would
cause nonradiative recombination. It has been later shown that the
nonradiative recombination can be suppressed by using a sufficiently
high concentration of dopants.10−13

Two major approaches are considered in fabricating
IB solar cells,
namely, quantum-dot IBs (QDIBs) and bulk IB solar cells. By using
quantum dots with different shapes and sizes, the IB levels can be
tuned. The first QDIB was produced in 2004 on the basis of the InAs/GaAs
QD material with an efficiency of 15.3%. Energy levels of the confined
states in a quantum dot can be used as IB in QDIBs. However, there
are many challenges with QDIBs as quantum dots are very small and
do not absorb a significant amount of light. With an increasing number
of QDs, the cell structure can be damaged, and strain will cause severe
damages. At room temperature, the Shockley–Read–Hall
recombination is a dominant mechanism that leads to low efficiency
in QDIB solar cells due to deeper impurities. Several research groups
have produced QDIB solar cells,14−22 and efficiencies over 18% have been reported by Blokhin et al.20

The second type of IB solar cells is based
on bulk materials. The
IB was detected through photoreflectance measurements in some bulk
materials, and this formation was attributed to band anticrossing
and heavily mismatched alloys.23 The first
of these bulk materials, ZnMnTeO, was developed by Walukiewicz and
co-workers.23 Later, numerous quantum-accurate
calculations have been performed on VInS bulk material, characterized
by an IB containing Fermi levels. Phillips and co-workers developed
bulk IB solar cells using ZnTe doped with an oxygen atom and obtained
higher efficiencies and short-circuit current than QDIB solar cells.24,25 The band gap properties of bulk materials are widely studied, and
the technologies are well verified by researchers.5,26−33 However, the search for intermediate-band gap materials continues,
to model high-efficiency IB solar cells. Figure 1 shows the band diagram of an IB solar cell
with Eg, the total band gap between the
top of the VB and the bottom of the CB. In the figure, Evi is the energy gap between the top of the VB to the
bottom of an IB, Eci is the energy gap
between the top of the IB to the bottom of the CB, and ΔEi is the width of the IB. Furthermore, the electronic
transitions of (V, I), (I, I), (I, C), and (V, C) are schematically
depicted in the figure.

VB and the bottom of an
IB, Eci—energy gap between the
top of the IB and the bottom of the CB, ΔEi—width of the IB, Eg—total
band gap between the top of the VB and the bottom of the CB. The electronic
transitions (V, I), (I, I), (I, C), and (V, C) are also explained.

In the present work, we study
2100 structures with the aim of identifying
ideal candidates for solar-cell materials. We employ density functional
theory (DFT) calculations to verify the presence of an IB, isolated
in the band gap of the semiconductor compounds of bulk material compounds
with different substitutional impurities forming ternary alloys. The
calculated band gap values are used to identify the most suitable
compounds for solar-cell applications. We also present density of
states (DOS) and effective mass calculations for the selected IB materials.

Results
and Discussion
The main focus of the present work is to find
the potential IB
materials from the selected 2100 compounds. Because of the very high
computational cost, we mainly focused on the electronic structure,
the DOS and effective mass calculations. The hybrid electronic structure
and optical properties of the selected IB compounds are under investigation,
and the results will be published in a forthcoming work. We employ
the DFT method to elucidate the band structure arrangement of 2100
bulk materials, vital for the interaction of IB and could be potent
solar cells with sufficient band gap. The DFT approaches to reveal
the significant and computational features of the bulk materials and
these features can be used as virtual screenings of band structures
of the 2100 compounds to identify the novel IB compounds. From the
first screening, we observed 312 compounds having an IB with the maximum
of the VB at the Fermi level. Among these, 282 compounds were selected
for further analysis and 30 compounds were found as heavy elements.
After carrying out a detailed analysis, we found out that only 17
compounds among the starting 282 would be acceptable semiconductor
materials for photovoltaic applications. The rest were found to be
perfect insulators, with band gap values larger than 3.51 eV.34 The electronic properties of these 17 compounds
are presented in Tables 1–3. It is well
known that the band gap (Eg) values of
solids obtained from usual DFT calculations are systematically underestimated
due to discontinuity in the exchange-correlation potential. Thus,
the calculated Eg values are typically
30–50% smaller than those measured experimentally.35 It is recognized that the theoretically calculated Eg for semiconductors and insulators are strongly
dependent on the approximations used, particularly on the exchange
and correlation terms of the potential. In the present work, because
of the large number compounds involved in the screening process, we
have used only generalized-gradient approximation. However, the overall
structure is not going to change except the band gap value irrespective
of the approximation.

We have chosen to divide the 17 compounds
with IBs into three groups
depending on the magnitude of their band gap values. The first group
of three compounds is named as narrow-band gap semiconductors, which
is characterized by band gaps varying from 1.2 to 2.5 eV. The second
group of eight compounds is named wide-band gap 1 semiconductors,
which includes materials with band gaps varying from 2.6 to 3.15 eV.
Finally, the third group is named as wide-band gap 2 semiconductors.
In this case, the band gap values vary from 3.15 to 3.5 eV. The band
structures of these compounds are presented in Figures 2a–c, 3a–d, 4a–d, and 5a–f,
and we calculate the total band gaps, band gaps Evi, Eci, and the widths of
the IB (ΔEi) bands for all of the
compounds. The electronic structure properties of these compounds
are presented in Tables 1, 2, and S1.

dotted line.

As presented in Table 1, narrow-band gap
semiconductors K6C60 (alkali fullerides), Au2Cs2I6,
and Ag2GeBaS4 had total indirect band gaps of
1.28, 2.35, and 2.41 eV, respectively.

From Figure 2a,
the calculated values for K6C60 are: The total
indirect band gap is 1.28 eV, band gaps Evi and Eci are 0.61 and 0.28 eV, respectively,
and the width of the IB is 0.39 eV. The band gap of 1.28 eV makes
an optimal compound for the PV applications as their light responses
are in the infrared region. Also, the IB will help the material to
absorb additional photons with lower energy. It should be noted that
K6C60 is already known as a semiconductor and
the nature of the band structure is not well explained about the IB.
However, they explained that the electronic structure of crystalline
K6C60 is indirect band gap of 0.48 eV.36 The DOS around the VB maximum is very similar
to that of the isolated C60 molecule, and the K atoms are
almost completely ionized.36

Similarly,
from Figure 2b, the
calculated values for Au2Cs2I6 are
as follows: The total indirect band gap is 2.35 eV, band
gaps Evi and Eci are 0.64 and 1.01 eV, respectively, and the width of the IB, ΔEi is 0.70 eV. The band gap of 2.35 eV for Au2Cs2I6 shows that the material has its
response to light in the visible region. For Au2Cs2I6, the IB region has the optimal thickness to
balance the absorption rate and recombination rate.37 In Figure 2b, Au2Cs2I6 has a broad band dispersion
of IB, enough to produce an optical depth for subgap light, ensuring
the compound to absorb subgap light so that it can be considered as
a potential PV material.37

From Figure 2c,
the calculated values for Ag2GeBaS4 are: The
total indirect band gap is 2.41 eV, band gaps Evi and Eci are 0.90 and 0.35 eV,
respectively, and the width of the IB is 1.16 eV. The band gap of
2.35 eV for Ag2GeBaS4 shows that the material
has its response to light in the visible region. Here, we observe
that the width of the IB, ΔEi, in
Ag2GeBaS4 is much higher than Eci and Evi. Because of the
broadness of the IB, photons can also be absorbed by the electrons
from lower-energy states of the IB to excite to higher-energy states
of IB. When the IB broadens, the absorption of photons for the transition
of electrons from the VB to lower-energy states of IB as well as from
the higher-energy states of IB to CB will be reduced. These effects
will lead to lower efficiencies of the solar cell based on Ag2GeBaS4. It has been shown that the efficiency limit
for an IB solar cell is reduced from higher to lower efficiencies
if the width is infinitesimally significant.38 It is important to note that all of these three materials, K6C60, Au2Cs2I6,
and Ag2GeBaS4, present indirect band gaps.

As presented in Table 2, the wide-band gap semiconductors CuAgPO4, Ag2ZnSnS4, Au2Cs2Br6, Ag3AsS4, Ag2KSbS4,
Na3Se4Sb, AgK2SbS4, and
AsRb3Se4 had the total band gaps of 2.62, 2.70,
2.71, 2.77, 2.93, 2.97, 2.97, and 3.15 eV, respectively. Figures 3a–d and 4a–d show the calculated band structures of
CuAgPO4, Ag2ZnSnS4, Au2Cs2Br6, Ag3AsS4, Ag2KSbS4, Na3Se4Sb, AgK2SbS4, and AsRb3Se4 with IB,
respectively. The calculated values of Evi, Eci, and ΔEi, and the total band gaps are presented in Table 2. The band gap type of the above
eight compounds is direct band gap except for Ag2KSbS4 (indirect band gap). From Figure 2c, the calculated values for Ag2ZnSnS4 are: The total direct band gap is 2.70 eV, band
gaps Evi and Eci are 0.47 and 0.57 eV, respectively, and the width of the IB is 1.66
eV. The band gap of 2.70 eV for Ag2ZnSnS4 shows
that the material has its response to light in the visible region.
Here, we observe that the width of the IB, ΔEi, in Ag2ZnSnS4 is much higher than Eci and Evi. The
increase in the IB width leads to a decrease in efficiency; however,
it is still significantly higher than that of a single-band gap solar
cell.39 The band gaps associated with optimum
efficiencies are constant for all IB solar cells when the IB width
exceeds 2 eV.39 Because of the display
of the small amount of data, we added the remaining six compounds
in the Supporting Information.

In
general, the electrochemical potentials of the electrons in
the different bands are close to the edges of the bands. The open-circuit
voltage of any solar cell is the difference between the CB minimum
at the electrode in contact with the n-type side and the VB maximum
at the electrode in contact with the p-type side. Thus, the maximum
photovoltage of IB solar cells on the materials presented in Tables 1 and S1 is limited to 2.41 and 3.51 eV, respectively.
Ag2GeBaS4 is still capable of absorbing energy
photons above 0.28 eV in Table 1 and Ag6SiSO8 of 0.47 eV in Table 2. IB solar cells can
deliver a maximum photovoltage by absorbing two sub-band gap photons
to produce one high-energy electron; the laws of thermodynamics would
be violated if this were not the case.1

All of the 17 semiconductor compounds presented in this work
have
properties that make them suitable for PV applications; we show here
the DOS analysis for three compounds, namely, Au2Cs2I6, Ag2GeBaS4, and Ag2ZnSnS4. The band gaps of 1.28 and 2.41 eV, respectively,
make Au2Cs2I6 and Ag2GeBaS4 optimal PV materials. Solar cells based on Ag2ZnSnS4 materials are interesting as a high efficiency
gain for these types of cells has been recently observed.40 There are also reports on the possibilities
to integrate Ag2ZnSnS4 in the Cu-based solar
cells as an additional absorption layer.40 The total DOS of Au2Cs2I6 in Figure 5 shows that the IB
is formed in the energy region between 0.64 and 1.34 eV. The IB composed
of I 2p are described by the projected density of states (PDOS), as
shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows that the IB
is formed in the energy region between 0.90 and 2.06 eV of the total
DOS of Ag2GeBaS4. We have also plotted the PDOS
at the IB mainly composed of the S 2p band and the Ge 4s band as well
as the smaller mixing of the Ba 4d band. For Ag2ZnSnS4, the IB is formed in the energy region between 0.47 and 2.13
eV, and the electron density, as shown in Figure 7 better describes the states. The PDOS of
Ag2ZnSnS4 at the IB mainly composed of the Sn
5s band and the S 2p band is shown in Figure 7. The Ag2ZnSnS4 has
an energy gap of 2.62 eV. We found the excellent IB peaks between
CB and VB in the three materials, namely, Au2Cs2I6, Ag2GeBaS4, and Ag2ZnSnS4. We observed that the p and s states play a vital
role in the band structure for the applicability of semiconductor
for PV applications.

In Figures 5–7, broadening of IB
indicates a highly parabolic
dispersion relationship that induces lower values for the DOS.41 From Tables 3 and 4, the electron effective
masses of Au2Cs2I6, Ag2GeBaS4, and Ag2ZnSnS4 are 0.095me, 0.021me, and
0.025me, respectively. Lower values for
the electron effective mass are as expected because the effective
mass is directly related to the values of DOS. In addition, the IB
region has the optimal thickness to balance the absorption rate and
the recombination rate.37 We may expect
the effective IBSC to have IB thickness enough to ensure these materials
to absorb sufficient subgap light. We conclude that the conversion
efficiency of bulk IBSC strongly depends not only on the band gap
but also on the position and thickness of IB and DOS.37,41

Effective Mass Calculation
The calculation of the effective mass is important for a detailed
study of energy levels in solar devices. The conductivity effective
masses of electrons and holes affect the mobility, electrical resistivity,
and free-carrier optical response of photovoltaic applications.42 To investigate the electron/hole conduction
properties of the identified IB materials, we have computed the electron/hole
effective mass at the VB/CB. For an excellent IB, a low effective
mass corresponds to a high mobility of the electrons/holes at the
VB/CB and consequently high conductivity. For the EM calculation,
we have employed the effective mass calculator (EMC).43 EMC implements the calculation of the effective masses
at the bands extreme using the finite difference method (FDM) (not
the band-fitting method). The effective mass (m*)
of charge carriers is defined as43 1  where x, y, and z are the directions
in the reciprocal Cartesian
space (2π/A), En(k) is the dispersion relation for
the nth electronic band, and indices i and j denote reciprocal components. The explicit
form of the symmetric tensor in the right-hand side of eq 1 is43 2  The
effective mass components are the inverse
of the eigenvalues of eq 2, and the principal directions correspond to the eigenvectors.43

To better understand the effective mass
of semiconductors, it is
not possible to fit the band to the quadratic polynomial. In this
case, the results from the parabolic fitting can be reproduced with
the FDM.43 The FDM employed to solve the effective mass approximation
equations because the spurious solutions can be included in the formalism,
and the FDM can be solved by the hard equation having a high degree
of polynomial.44 This approach is quite
reliable, and it was successfully applied for several classes of materials
in the literature.43 We present the effective
masses of 14 compounds in Tables 3 and 4. The effective mass of
an electron was computed from the minimum of the CB; the effective
mass of the heavy hole was computed from the maximum of the first
VB curvature, whereas the second VB curvature was used for the light
hole. In the case of materials presented in Tables 3 and 4, the PBE functional
predicts the effective masses of the light hole, heavy hole, and electron,
which are parabolic-fitted values with a step size of 0.05 (1/bohr).
The three narrow-band gap compounds, K6C60,
Au2Cs2I6, and Ag2GeBaS4, have low effective masses, as presented in Table 3.

The thirteen wide-band
gap compounds in Table 4 have effective masses of electron lower
than those of light holes and heavy holes except for CuAgPO4. The effective masses of electron of photovoltaic materials silicon
(Si), germanium (Ge), and gallium arsenide (GaAs) are 0.26me, 0.067me, and
0.12me, respectively.45,46 The above three photovoltaic materials are single-band gap materials.
It is well known that the band gaps of Si, Ge, and GaAs are 1.12,
0.66, and 1.424 eV, respectively. The maximum energy conversion of
silicon and GaAs solar cells can reach 30% efficiency.48 We can use germanium as the doping material
in silicon solar cells because of its low band gap. We noticed that
the effective masses of the electron for the silicon and GaAs are
low.45 From our results, we observed that
the effective masses of electron for K6C60,
Au2Cs2I6, and Ag2GeBaS4 are 0.216me, 0.095me, and 0.021me, respectively.

From Table 4, we
noted that the effective masses of electron for Ag2ZnSnS4, Au2Cs2Br6, Ag3AsS4, Ag2KSbS4, Na3Se4Sb, Al2HgSe4, PdPbF4, Ag6SiSO8 are 0.025me,
0.806me, 0.012me, 0.034me, 0.085me, 0.021me, 0.094me, and 0.053me, respectively.
Hence, the effective masses of electron of our narrow-band gap and
wide-band gap materials are approximately equal to those of the photovoltaic
materials. From Table 4, the effective mass of an electron is 0.025me for Ag2ZnSnS4 in [110] plane direction.
We observed from Jing et al. that the effective mass of an electron
is 0.16me for Ag2ZnSnS4 in [100] plane direction.42 Hence,
we found a lower effective mass in [110] direction than in [100] direction.
These effective masses are better described by the band structures
of the most curved parabolic band, as shown in Figures 3–5. Because
of the effective masses for the presented materials, in this article,
the electron mobility from VB to CB will be higher and the recombination
effect will be lower.

Conclusions
We have carried out
a comprehensive study of the electronic band
structures of 2100 new bulk compounds using first-principle calculations
with the DFT. Among these compounds, we have found that only 17 compounds
have IBs. These compounds could be potentially used as photovoltaic
materials based on the detailed studies of band structure, the DOS
and effective mass calculations. Our effective mass calculations show
that these compounds have high electron/hole conduction properties,
which make them suitable for PV applications. Although we have studied
2100 new compounds from the ICSD database, our study clearly demonstrates
the possibility of having more IB materials from the list of currently
known compounds from the database. Thus, we are in the process of
investigating more IB-compounds and results of the detailed analysis
will be published in a forthcoming article.

Computational Details
Total energies have been calculated by the projected augmented
plane-wave (PAW) implementation of the Vienna ab initio simulation
package.47 Ground-state geometries were
determined by minimizing stresses and the Hellman–Feynman forces
using the conjugate-gradient algorithm with a force convergence threshold
if 10–3 eV Å–1. Brillouin-zone
integration was performed using the Monkhorst–Pack k-meshes with a Gaussian broadening of 0.1 eV. A 600 eV
kinetic energy cutoff was used for the plane-wave expansion. All of
these calculations usually set to use approximately the same density
of k-points in the reciprocal space for all structures.
Because a large variety of structures was considered in this study,
both metallic and insulating, we ensured that the k-points mesh was dense enough to determine the total energy with
meV/atom accuracy. All structures containing transition elements are
treated using the spin-polarized approach. In some cases, the starting
magnetization vanished as self-consistency was reached. For all of
these computations, the starting structures were directly taken from
the ICSD database and input parameters, and file generation was done
automatically by locally developed code “Tool”. For
the calculation of band structure, the k-point files
were generated again with the help of locally developed code “KPATH”.
The information about the high symmetric points of the k-vector in the Brillouin zone was taken from the Bilbao Crystallographic
Server.48−50 All of the calculated electronic structures of the
studied systems are documented in the DFTBD database. For the transition
metals, we have used exchange-correlation functional with the Hubbard
parameter correction (GGA+U), following the rotationally
invariant form. The full details about the computed U and J values are presented in the DFTBD database
website.51−54
