The heterojunctions of organic/two-dimensional
transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) have the potential to be used in the next-generation
optoelectronic and photonic devices. Herein, we have systemically
investigated the temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy to elucidate
the phonon shift and thermal properties of the semiconducting TMD
nanosheets grafted by a conjugated polymer (PG-MoS2 and
PG-MoSe2) forming heterojunctions. Our results reveal that
softening of Raman modes of PG-TMDs as temperature increases from
77 to 300 K is due to the negative temperature coefficient (TC) and
anharmonicity. The TCs of E12g and A1g modes of PG-MoS2 nanosheets and A1g mode of
PG-MoSe2 were found to be −0.015, −0.010,
and −0.010 cm–1 K–1, respectively.
The origin of negative TCs is explained on the basis of a double resonance
process, which is more active in single- and few-layer MoS2 and MoSe2. Interestingly, the temperature-dependent behavior
of the phonon modes of PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 is
similar to that of pristine nanosheets. Grafting by conjugated polymer
does not affect the electron–phonon (e–p) interaction
in the semiconducting (2H-phase) TMDs, hinting the application potential
of such materials in field-effect electronic devices.

1 Introduction
Over
the past years, two-dimensional (2D) layered material has
become one of the vibrant areas of nanomaterial research.1,2 Among them, graphene analogous of inorganic transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) such as MoS2,3−5 WS2,4,6 MoSe2,4,7 and WSe28,9 have
been paid great interest because they possess multifunctional properties
suitable for ultrathin nanoelectronic device applications. In fact,
monolayer TMDs have attracted tremendous attention due to their plausible
applications in various electronic and optoelectronic devices such
as thin-film transistors, ultrathin photovoltaics, sensors, and phototransistors.
Atomically thin layers of TMDs having chemical formula MX2 (X–M–X), where M is the transition metal element from
group VI (Mo or W) and X is the chalcogen (S or Se), are bounded by
van der Waals force in the bulk. The monolayer semiconducting MoS2 (and MoSe2) possesses a direct wide band gap of
1.8 eV (and 1.55 eV), whereas the bulk has an indirect band gap of
1.2 eV (and 1.10 eV).10,11 The change in the band structure
from bulk to a monolayer affects the optical and electrical properties.
Free carriers conduct through the extended conduction band in an ultrathin
monolayer of TMD, which possesses high absorbance (5–10%) of
visible solar spectrum.12 These properties
of monolayer glimpse its potential applications in various optoelectronic
devices.

Recently, beyond the inorganic electronic application
of 2D materials,
many reports have focused to pave the platform of utilizing few-layer
2D TMDs in organic and organometalic halide perovskite electronic
applications in various ways. Few-layer TMDs exhibit extraordinary
optical and electrical properties.13−16 They have significantly larger
optical density compared with monolayer TMDs and can withstand considerably
higher injection current. The enhanced optical density in few-layer
TMDs results in 100 times enhancement in the external quantum efficiency
than the monolayer devices.13 Beyond this,
the charge carriers in layered TMDs behave like 2D electron gas and
experience quantum confinement effect. It is also noted that the few
layers of MoS2 and MoSe2 exhibit high carrier
mobility of 500 and 50 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively, with high on/off current ratio.3,7 The layer number dependent mobility makes them interesting for the
field-effect device applications.14,16 Peng et al.17 highlighted the feasibility of applying defect-engineered
2D TMDs as the charge-extraction layers in perovskite-based optoelectronic
devices. Multilayer MoS2 has been utilized in inverted
organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaics as an electron acceptor.18 It has been found that nanoscale MoSe2 is used as a novel acceptor in hybrid photovoltaic applications.19 Chen and co-workers20 reported crystallization of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)
utilizing MoS2. In the presence of MoS2, 38-fold
enhancement in hole mobility compared with the noncrystallized film
was observed. The present reported findings are quite aggressive toward
the positive gesture of TMDs in organic and perovskite electronic
device applications. Nevertheless, ultrathin 2D materials show strong
in-plane crystalline orientation dependent properties such as electrical
mobility, photoresponsivity, and thermoelectric properties. Solution
processable organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) usually have
high on/off ratio,21 but they suffer from
low mobility due to the charge carrier transport via inefficient hopping
mechanism. The problem of low carrier mobility in organic electronic
devices can be overcome by integrating few-layer TMDs with organic
semiconductors. In such devices, bias voltage can cause self-heating
of the devices. The self-heating can lead to change in the electron–phonon
(e–p) interaction and, consequently, in the vibrational properties
of the semiconducting materials. These properties are strongly associated
with the behavior of electrons and phonons, which are related to intrinsic
properties of the materials and can be probed by light–matter
interaction.

Raman spectroscopy is a nonintrusive and nondestructive
nanometerlogical
tool, which offers a unique insight into the properties of layered
and molecular semiconductors, including their structure, molecular
orientation, and fundamental processes, which are critically important
for the performance of a wide range of organic and hybrid semiconductor
devices. This technique has been exploited to study the vibrational
properties of different 2D TMDs to understand the e–p interaction,
which, in turn, influences the performances of the electronic devices.
Nonetheless, the shift in the peak position of Raman mode with temperature
is closely associated with the heat dissipation and, hence, the thermal
conductivity. Therefore, one can get the idea of thermal conductivity
of TMDs from the temperature-dependent Raman measurements, as the
conductivity is directly related to the first-order temperature coefficient
(TC) of the vibrational mode.22 MoS2 sheets exhibit two prominent Raman peaks corresponding to
the in-plane (E12g) and out-of-plane (A1g) phonon modes, whereas the Raman spectrum of MoSe2 sheets contains only the signature of A1g mode.22−24 Recently, temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy investigations
were carried out on the few-layer MoS2 and MoSe2 sheets.22,24−27 Yan et al.26 reported the temperature-dependent Raman spectra for both
suspended and substrate-supported monolayer MoS2. They
noticed that both E12g and A1g modes
soften linearly with the rise in temperature. According to them, A1g mode exhibits similar behavior for both the samples. However,
a difference was observed in E12g mode because
of the presence of a substrate-induced strain. In contrast, Zdrojek
and co-workers27 reported the nonlinear
temperature dependence of both the Raman modes of MoS2 monolayer supported on SiO2 and explained that
in the light of the decay of an optical phonon into two acoustic phonons.
However, till date, there is no study on the vibrational properties
of few-layer TMDs (MoS2 or MoSe2) integrated
by organic molecules or semiconductors employing Raman spectroscopy.

In this study, we report for the first time, temperature-dependent
Raman studies of few-layer polymer-grafted MoS2 and MoSe2 prepared via semiconductive polymer-assisted chemical exfoliation
(SPACE) method. The frequency of Raman modes of PG-TMDs was found
to be temperature dependent and vary linearly with temperature. The
first-order temperature coefficients for different modes were estimated
from the temperature-dependent frequency shift. Moreover, we compare
the vibrational properties of PG-TMDs with pristine TMDs.

2 Results and Discussion
The optical absorption spectrum of
poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)
(P3HT), PG-MoS2, and PG-MoSe2 nanosheets are
shown in Figure 1.
It can be seen that both polymer-grafted TMDs show two distinct absorption
bands between 1 and 2.5 eV. The dual absorption peaks are attributed
to the interband excitonic transition at K-point of the Brillouin
zone with the energy splitting due to the valence band spin–orbit
coupling.16,28−30 Prominent excitonic
absorption peaks around 2.8 eV for both PG-TMDs clearly signify the
characteristic peaks of P3HT. These observations suggest that the
2H phase of the TMDs remains intact even after the chemical exfoliation
using conjugated polymer. Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows the XRD spectrum
of the bulk TMDs (MoS2 and MoSe2) and their
polymer-grafted nanoscale heterojunctions. The diffraction pattern
(Supporting Information, Figure S1) of the bulk MoS2 shows peaks at 2θ
values 14, 33, 40, 50, and 59° corresponding to the planes (002),
(100), (103), (105), and (110), respectively.31,32 On the other hand, the bulk MoSe2 exhibits a series of
diffraction peaks at 13.79, 27.37, 31.64, 37.83, 41.87, 47.37, and
55.94° corresponding to the planes (002), (004), (100), (103),
(105), (106), and (008), respectively.33,34 However, the
XRD spectra of the PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 exhibit
only one intense peak at 14 and 13.79°, respectively, indicating
the presence of an unaltered 2H phase.32,35 Field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy
(AFM) images were recorded to study the dimensions of the 2D TMD sheets.
The SEM (Figure 2a,b)
images indicate that the lateral dimension of the PG-MoS2 flake is ∼200 nm, whereas that of the PG-MoSe2 flake is ∼100 nm. The presence of PG-TMD nanosheets of similar
sizes is also evident from the captured AFM images (Figure 2c,d). Blurred AFM and SEM images
of PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 suggest the presence
of the soft conjugated polymer (P3HT) coating on the surface of the
TMD sheets. To find the sheet thickness, we measured the AFM height
profiles (Figure S2) of many nanosheets.
The result of the height profile measurements are summarized in the
histogram plots (Figure 2e,f). The average thickness of a sheet of PG-MoS2 and
PG-MoSe2 was found to be 3.0 and 3.1 nm, respectively.
According to the previous literature, the average thickness of a TMD
monolayer is ∼0.7 nm.3,36 Therefore, our synthesized
PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 nanosheets are expected
to consist of four layers. A slightly more height of a polymer-grafted
TMD nanosheet than that of a four-layer pristine TMD sheet is most
likely due to the presence of a polymer layer on the surface of the
TMD nanosheet. Figure 3a–d shows the low- and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopic (TEM) images of PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2. The typical TEM images confirm the sheetlike morphology of the
as-prepared and modified MoS2. The highly crystalline nature
is apparent from the HR-TEM images and the diffraction patterns of
the few-layer PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 (inset: Figure 3c,d). Interplaner
spacing of 0.27 and 0.28 nm is observed in PG-MoS2 and
PG-MoSe2, respectively (Figure 3), suggesting the structural uniformity and
integrity of the synthesized materials.

The Raman spectra of PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 were measured at room temperature as well as at different
cryogenic
temperatures. The schematic of the experimental setup and its photograph
are shown in Figure 4. Figure 5a exhibits
the typical Raman spectrum of the chemically exfoliated few-layer
PG-MoS2 nanosheets at room temperature. The spectrum depicts
two prominent peaks at 380.85 and 406.42 cm–1, corresponding
to two different modes E12g and A1g of vibration, respectively. The mode E12g arises
due to the in-plane vibration of two S atoms in one direction and
a Mo atom in the opposite direction, and A1g is associated
with the out-of-plane vibration of two S atoms (vibrating opposite
to each other) while the Mo atom remains stable. The relative motion
of the various atoms for the observed phonon modes are schematically
presented in the inset of Figure 5a. Figure 5b represents the Raman spectrum of PG-MoSe2 at
room temperature. The Raman spectrum of PG-MoSe2 recorded
at room temperature exhibits a strong peak at 239.76 cm–1, corresponding to the A1g mode of vibration, which is
associated with the out-of-plane vibration of two Se atoms (vibrating
opposite to each other) while the Mo atom remains stable (inset of Figure 5b).

PG-MoSe2 (laser power density 0.64 mW/μm2). Inset: Schematic representation of the motion of atoms corresponding
to the different Raman active modes of TMDs.

Figure 6a,b
represents
the temperature-varying Raman spectra of PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 nanosheets. As seen from the figures, the Raman peaks of
E12g and A1g for PG-MoS2 and peak of A1g for PG-MoSe2 nanosheets shift
to lower frequencies and get broadened with increase in the temperature
from 77 K to higher values. This temperature-dependent shift of both
the peaks could be attributed to the anharmonic coupling of the phonons
and the thermal expansion of the lattice, which change the equilibrium
positions of the atoms by changing the interatomic forces and thus
the phonon energies. Figure 7a,b depicts the peak positions (obtained by fitting with a
Lorentzian function) as a function of temperature in E12g and A1g modes for few-layer PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 nanoheterojunctions. It is evident from
the figures that the frequencies of the Raman modes of PG-MoS2 (E12g and A1g) and PG-MoSe2 (A1g) vary linearly with the temperature. Apparently,
position scattering is bigger for PG-MoSe2 nanosheets at
higher temperatures. This could be either due to the slight variation
in the laser spot on the PG-MoSe2 nanosheet sample or the
local Raman stage vibration. Moreover, low excitation power on the
PG-MoSe2 nanosheet sample surface because of the extra
attenuation from the cold–hot cell window during the experiments
could not be ruled out.37,38 To find the first-order
temperature coefficient (TC), the Lorentzian peak positions of E12g and A1g were fitted using the Grüneisen model22,39 1  where ω0 is the frequency
of the vibration of E12g or A1g modes
at the absolute zero of temperature and χ is the first-order
temperature coefficient of the E12g or A1g modes. Fitting of the experimental data yielded the values
of χ for E12g or A1g modes
of few-layer PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 nanosheets
and were found to be −0.0158, −0.0106, and −0.010
cm–1 K–1, respectively. We compare
these temperature coefficients with that of the few-layer pristine
MoS2 and MoSe2 (Table 1).40−42 Very close values of the temperature
coefficients of PG-TMDs and pristine TMDs suggest that the electron–phonon
interaction in TMDs remains unaffected by polymer grafting.

The variation in the Raman
peak positions with temperature is predominantly
due to the temperature contribution resulting from the anharmonicity
and thermal expansion or volume contribution. The phonon frequency
ω of the Raman mode can be expressed as a function of temperature
and volume.43 2  where γ and k are the
volume thermal coefficient and the isothermal volume compressibility,
respectively. The first term of the right-hand side of eq 2 is the volume contribution at a
constant temperature and the second term represents the temperature
contribution at a constant volume. The pure temperature or anharmonic
contribution can be determined from the values of isobaric temperature
and isothermal pressure derivative of the phonon frequencies of normal
modes in the few-layer PG-MoS2 and from the γ and k values.

Figure S3 (Supporting Information) represents the plot of full width half-maximum
(FWHM) of A1g and E12g Raman mode
as a function of temperature for few-layer PG-TMDs. It is interesting
to note that the FWHM for out-of-plane (A1g) Raman modes
increases with an increase in the temperature for both polymer-grafted
TMDs. However, the FWHM of the in-plane Raman mode (E12g) of PG-MoS2 remains unaffected. The temperature-dependent
variations in the intensity and the FWHM and the shift in the Raman
peak position can be explained in terms of the double resonance phenomenon,
which is very active in single- and few-layer thick samples. The variation in Raman mode broadening or the phonon line width
with temperature could be rationalized by phonon dispersion and many-body
theoretical calculations. One can consider that the contribution of
Raman mode broadening arises from the decay of the zone center optical
phonon into one optical and one acoustic phonon belonging to the same
branch. The optical Raman phonon that decays
two acoustic phonons of opposite phonon belonging to the same branch
is selected from the density of states of the layered materials. The
phonon line width as a function of temperature can be expressed as44  where Γ0 is the
background
contribution, A is the anharmonic coefficient, and n(ω, T) is the Bose–Einstein contribution function.
The parameters such as Γ0, A, ω1, and ω2 can be derived from the variations
in FWHM with temperature. The changes in Raman frequency (Δω′)
as temperature varies from 77 to 300 K for the E12g and A1g Raman modes are found to be 3.012 and 1.999 cm–1, respectively, for few-layer PG-MoS2.
The change in Raman frequency of the Raman modes A1g in
few-layer PG-MoSe2 was found to be 3.08 cm–1 (temperature varies from 77 to 400 K). These values are quite similar
to the calculated Δω′ values of Raman modes of
E12g and A1g for few-layer MoS2 and MoSe2.25

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have systematically investigated
the temperature-dependent
Raman spectroscopy of the organic semiconductor modified, 2H phase
nanoscale TMD nanosheets over a wide range of temperatures. Our results
reveal the softening of vibrational modes (E12g and A1g) of few-layer PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 nanosheets (2H phase) with an increase in temperature. The
spectral Raman shift is mainly contributed from the thermal and anharmonic
properties. The softening of all of the Raman modes is a consequence
of the double-resonance phenomenon. The calculated first-order temperature
coefficient of E12g and A1g Raman
modes for few-layer PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 (nanoscale
heterojunctions) are observed to be similar to that of the pristine
TMDs nanosheets. The electron–phonon interaction that influences
the carrier mobility in the TMDs remains unaffected by polymer grafting.
Our findings are immensely motivating for the secure application of
PG-TMDs in the solution-processable organic/inorganic hybrid electronic
devices.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Preparation
of MoS2 and MoSe2 Nanosheets
Bulk MoS2 (grain size less
than 10 μm) and MoSe2 (∼325 mesh) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, and used without further purification. Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)
(P3HT) and chloroform were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 were synthesized via SPACE. In brief,
MoS2/MoSe2 powder (3 mg/mL) is dissolved in
chloroform via magnetic stirring for 48 h at room temperature. Then,
P3HT (0.2 mg/mL) was added with continued stirring for 72 h. After proper stirring, the hybrid solution was sonicated for 8 h
in an ultrasonic bath under 100 W power and 40 kHz ultrasonic frequency
to obtain the dispersion of PG-MoS2/PG-MoSe2. Finally, the dispersion was purified using centrifugation at a
moderate rpm for 10 min to remove the excess P3HT and unexfoliated
MoS2/MoSe2. Thus the prepared dispersion of
PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 nanosheets was dropcasted
on the microscope glass coverslips for the Raman spectroscopy measurements.
To avoid the aggregation of PG-TMD sheets, mother dispersions (PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2) were 10 times diluted before casting.
The Raman measurements were carried out on an ensemble of PG-TMD sheets.

4.2 Material Characterization
Chemically
exfoliated layered PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 were
characterized using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction,
optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), and Raman spectroscopy. The UV–vis absorption
spectrum was collected using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrometer (Agilent
Technologies) and the X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on
Smart Lab (RIGAKU) 9 kW rotating anode diffractometer. The taping
mode AFM images and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
images were collected using Dimension Icon with ScanAsyst, Bruker,
and FEI FE-SEM Nova NanoSem 450 instruments, respectively. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed by a TECNAI G2 200
kV TEM (FEI, Electron Optics) electron microscope with 200 kV input
voltage. The temperature-dependent Raman spectra of PG-MoS2 and PG-MoSe2 were collected using a confocal micro-Raman
spectrometer (LABRAM HR Evolution, Horiba JobinYvon SAS) with a laser
source of wavelength 532 nm in the backscattering geometry. The laser
beam was focused using a 50× long-working distance objective
with a numerical aperture NA = 0.05 and 1800 g/mm grating. The sample
was placed inside a cryostat (Linkam) and the Raman spectra were recorded
within the temperature range 77–300 K for PG-MoS2 and 80–400 K for PG-MoSe2 at an interval of 20
K.
