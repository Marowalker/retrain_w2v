Polybenzimidazole-based ionenes are explored for use
in both alkaline
anion-exchange membrane fuel cells and alkaline polymer electrolyzers.
Poly-(hexamethyl-p-terphenylbenzimidazolium) (HMT-PMBI),
the material of interest in this article, is exceptionally hydroxide-stable
and water-insoluble. The impact of the degree of methylation on conformations
and electronic structure properties of HMT-PMBI oligomers, from the
monomer to the pentamer, is studied with density functional theory
calculations. Optimization studies are presented for both the gas
phase and in the presence of implicit water. In addition, time-dependent
density functional theory is employed to generate the UV–vis
absorption spectra of the studied systems. Results are insightful
for experimentalists and theorists investigating the impact of synthetic
and environmental conditions on the conformation and electronic properties
of polybenzimidazole-based membranes.

1 Introduction
Research on anion-exchange
membranes (AEMs) is thriving, propelled
by their promising potential for uses in alkaline electrochemical
energy technologies such as fuel cells,1−3 water electrolyzers,4 redox flow batteries,5 and waste-water treatment systems.6 Alkaline
conditions offer distinct advantages over acidic conditions. A major
driver for the development of alkaline technologies is the possible
replacement of Pt- by Ni-based materials as oxygen reduction catalysts.7 AEMs that are already being tested in fuel cells
possess relatively simple synthetic routes, which is another advantage
over proton-conducting polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs).2,8 AEMs also show promise in reducing the membrane sensitivity to variations
in the hydration level, which could reduce humidification requirements
and electrode flooding, and thereby diminish system costs.7,9

On the flip side, a decade ago, the ion conductivity of AEMs
trailed
that of PEMs by a significant factor. Nafion 117,10 as the benchmark PEM, has a proton conductivity of 78 mS
cm–1,11 whereas anion
conductivities of AEMs used to lie in the range of 5–20 mS
cm–1.12 However, over
the last 10 years, conductivities of AEMs have seen significant improvement,
with values reported recently in the range from 50 to 200 mS cm–1.13−15 As a matter of fact, over the last 10 years, the
number of publications on polyaromatic AEMs, including HMT-PMBI and
HMT-PMPI, has increased significantly in comparison to the number
of publications on polyolefin and perfluorinated PEMs, which had stagnating
publication numbers.16

Over the past
years, materials chemists have tested strategies
in chemical design and synthesis to overcome the issue of the poor
chemical stability of AEMs.17 The most
common cationic moieties employed are phosphonium-,18 sulfonium-,19 pyridinium-,20 ammonium-,21 and
imidazolium-based cations, among which benzimidazolium is the most
promising in terms of stability and synthetic route.13,22,23 In a charged benzimidazole ring,
the nitrogen cation stability is provided by steric protection via
methyl groups.24

This work focuses
on a sterically C2-protected poly(benzimidazole)
material, called poly-(hexamethyl-p-terphenylbenzimidazolium)
or in short HMT-PMBI, that was developed by Holdcroft and co-workers.25 This compound is hydroxide-stable, methanol-soluble,
and water-insoluble, which renders it highly suitable for uses in
fuel cells and electrolyzers.8,25 It exhibits unprecedented
hydroxide stability and ion conductivity from 25 to 80 °C and
concentrations from 1 to 6 M NaOH, and it was synthesized with varying
degree of methylation (dm), as reported in ref (25). In that article, only
6% chemical degradation was reported when the HMT-PMBI membrane was
exposed to 2 M NaOH at 80 °C for 7 days.

Despite its promising
attributes, to the best of our knowledge,
only one density functional theory (DFT) work has been performed on
the HMT-PMBI material,8 but no comprehensive
computational exploration of its molecular conformation and electronic
structure has been reported so far. Because physical properties of
HMT-PMBI are strongly affected by the degree of methylation, in this
study, we consider the degree of methylation as the main parameter.8,22 The primary objective of this study is to understand the effect
of the degree of methylation on molecular conformation, electronic
structure, and optical properties of HMT-PMBI.

2 Results and Discussion
Optimized structures
of the repeating unit of PBI, HMT-PMBI, HMT-PMBI+, and
HMT-PMBI2+ obtained using the B3LYP functional
under vacuum conditions are shown in Figure 1. For PBI, the phenyl ring and the two adjoining
benzimidazole rings are in-plane. The torsional angle between two
adjoining benzimidazole rings was found to be 39°, and the one
between phenyl and benzimidazole rings was 7.6°, as also shown
in Table 1. For the
HMT-PMBI repeating unit, however, because of the steric interaction
between the mesitylene ring and benzimidazole group, a torsional angle
of about 104° is formed. Considering the fully methylated HMT-PMBI
repeating unit, the angle between the adjacent benzimidazole and mesitylene
planes is about 82°, and it is 40° between two consecutive
benzimidazole groups. By increasing the degree of methylation, the
angle between the adjacent mesitylene and benzimidazole planes decreases
from 107° to about 82°, as shown in Table 1. The reason for this change is the additional
methyl group in the benzimidazole unit, which provides steric protection
to the cationic imidazole rings.

of PBI, HMT-PMBI, HMT-PMBI+, and HMT-PMBI2+.

a Torsional angles are shown in Figure 1).

Figure 2 shows the
optimized structures from the monomer up to the pentamer of the neutral
and the charged HMT-PMBI polymers along with their end-to-end distances,
which are normalized to the number of repeating units. As can be seen,
results reveal a trend in the chain conformation of HMT-PMBI as a
function of the degree of methylation. As the charge increases, the
normalized end-to-end distance becomes larger from around 16 Å
for HMT-PMBI to around 19 Å for HMT-PMBI+ and to around
21 Å for HMT-PMBI2+. The observed chain stretching
is caused by the electrostatic repulsion along the backbone. Both
the gas phase and solvent studies are relevant in real systems as
the hydration level is not uniform across the membrane, for example,
it is possible to have our membrane in the fully hydrated condition
or in the high temperature/vapor phase. Hence, we investigated the
solvent effects by optimizing the tetramer structures in the presence
of implicit water using the polarizable continuum model (PCM).26,27 As expected, the charge screening provided by the solvent suppresses
the electrostatic repulsion among charged backbone units, rendering
the normalized end-to-end distance almost unchanged from the one obtained
for the corresponding neutral polymer. The DFT-optimized structure
of the 100% dm HMT-PMBI trimer in the gas phase calculated in the
work of Schibli28 shows that the angle
between the adjacent mesitylene and benzimidazole groups and two adjacent
benzimidazole rings is 77 and 47°, respectively, which is consistent
with our findings.

systems
in the gas phase. Numbers represent the normalized end-to-end distance
values.

Figure 3 shows the
electrostatic potential energy map. On neutral HMT-PMBI, negative
charge is accumulated on the nitrogen atoms of the benzimidazole ring,
indicated in red. As the degree of methylation increases, more positive
charge is distributed on benzimidazole groups of the backbone, as
shown in darker blue for HMT-PMBI+ and HMT-PMBI2+. This is in agreement with the observation of stretching and change
in the persistence length value because of electrostatic repulsion.29,30

potential energy map of the tetramer of HMT-PMBIs.

In Figure 4, the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO), and Egap, obtained with
the B3LYP functional, are plotted as functions of the oligomer length
for the various degrees of methylation. As the length of the oligomer
increases, the structure becomes more stabilized and HOMO, LUMO, and Egap converge to specific values corresponding
to the infinite (polymer) structure. For instance, for HMT-PMBI+, the HOMO, LUMO, and band gap energy levels are −9.0,
−6.5, and 2.5 eV, respectively. It should be noted that for
charged oligomers, the drop in the energy levels from the monomer
to the trimer is significantly larger (over 20 times larger) than
that of the neutral HMT-PMBI and PBI oligomers. Moreover, the increasing
degree of methylation causes a decrease in HOMO and LUMO energy levels
and in the band gap of HMT-PMBI. The band gap for HMT-PMBI+ and HMT-PMBI2+ is decreased by approximately 2.0 and
3.0 eV relative to neutral HMT-PMBI, respectively. The values of HOMO,
LUMO, and Egap are shown in Table 2. HOMO and LUMO levels of neutral
HMT-PMBI lie slightly above those of PBI, as shown in Figure 4; consequently, the band gap
of PBI is lower than that of HMT-PMBI by about 0.5 eV. In general,
the relatively large values of Egap imply
that HMT-PMBI-based polymers have insulator properties, as is known
from experimental characterization.31

Figure 5 shows the
molecular orbitals for the repeating units of the studied systems
in the gas phase and in the presence of implicit water. Evidently,
introducing an electron diminishing group onto the polymer backbone,
that is, a methyl group, has significant influence on the HOMO and
LUMO energy levels. For the PBI repeating unit, the HOMO level is
delocalized along the backbone, indicating a strong electronic coupling
between the subunits. On the neutral HMT-PMBI repeating unit, both
in the absence and the presence of solvent, the HOMO level is predominantly
localized on the benzimidazole groups and the contributions from phenyl
and mesitylene rings are almost negligible. Weaker electronic coupling
is expected in this case because of the relatively large torsional
angles between these groups. On 75% dm HMT-PMBI, the HOMO level is
further localized with a negligible contribution from the charged
nitrogen of the benzimidazole unit. This trend is more significant
on fully methylated HMT-PMBI, where the HOMO is strongly localized
on the phenyl unit. In the presence of implicit water, however, the
HOMO is more delocalized because of the charge screening effect exerted
by the solvent. As also shown in Figure 5, the electron densities of the LUMO of PBI
and HMT-PMBI are rather delocalized, while those for HMT-PMBI+ and HMT-PMBI2+ are more localized on the charged
units both in the gas phase and in the presence of implicit water.

LUMO of the studied systems in the gas phase and in the
presence of water solvent.

The changes in the polymer charge because of the
varying degree
of methylation and consequent conformational changes along the backbone
have an impact on the UV–vis absorption spectra as could be
measured in photoluminescence experiments.32 We used time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to investigate the excited states
of the repeating units of neutral, partially, and fully methylated
HMT-PMBI. As shown in Figure 6, the spectrum of HMT-PMBI+ exhibits two peaks
associated with the two separate electronic transitions in its corresponding
structure. The spectra for the HMT-PMBI+ and HMT-PMBI2+ structures are shifted to longer wavelengths relative to
the HMT-PMBI structure, which is not surprising because as discussed,
the band gap decreases for the charged polymers.

Figure 6 Absorption spectra of
the various repeating units of polybenzimidazole-based
ionenes using TD-DFT.

Peaks become broader as the degree of methylation
increases. The
spectrum for HMT-PMBI is centered near 300 nm; for HMT-PMBI+, the broader peak is at around 410 nm, while the narrower one is
at 310 nm, and for HMT-PMBI2+, the broad peak is at 330
nm. In addition, in Figure 6, the spectrum of the PBI repeating unit is shown with a peak
centered at 330 nm and a shoulder at 275 nm. This agrees well with
experimental results in ref (32), where two distinct peaks were reported by the authors
in the absorption spectrum of PBI, one at 284 nm (4.36 eV) and another
one at 360 nm (3.44 eV), which corresponded to the π →
π* transition in their work.32

In Table 3, we report
the HOMO, LUMO, and Egap values for the
tetramer of PBI and HMT-PMBIs with various degrees of methylations
obtained with different DFT functionals.

As shown in Figure 7, the choice of the DFT functional results in similar
trends for
all systems; Grimme’s functional including dispersion, B97D,
as well as PBE and TPSS functionals, which are at the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) and meta-GGA level, respectively, predict
higher values for the HOMO compared to the hybrid functionals, namely,
O3LYP, B3LYP, PBE1, and wB97XD. The HOMO level predicted by wB97XD
is significantly lower than that for the other functionals. Likewise,
the LUMO predicted by B97D, PBE, and TPSS is smaller than those predicted
by hybrid functionals, while the LUMO obtained with the wB97XD functional
is significantly larger than that for other functionals. Therefore,
wB97XD gives the largest value of Egap for all systems by a difference in the range between 3 and 5 eV. Egap calculated by PBE1 is larger than that found
with B3LYP by about 0.3–0.4 eV and that for B3LYP is larger
than the value for O3LYP by about 0.4–0.5 eV. In turn, Egap values predicted by PBE and TPSS are smaller
than that obtained with B3LYP by 1.0–1.5 eV. B97D, on the other
hand, predicts similar values to the PBE functional with a difference
smaller than 0.05 eV. Similar calculations for π-conjugated
polymers reported in ref (33) suggest that B3LYP is in better agreement with experimental
values.33 However, experimental characterization
employing, for instance, cyclic voltammetry and UV–visible
spectra is needed to determine, which functional provides the most
accurate prediction of ionene properties.

functionals on the HOMO, LUMO, and

3 Conclusions
This work focused on the
conformational properties of HMT-PMBI
oligomers. We demonstrated that the ionic charge distribution, electronic
structure, and optical properties of single ionene moieties can be
calculated well with DFT. Results indicate an increase in the electrostatic
repulsion of ionene moieties in the gas phase with the increasing
degree of methylation, leading to a stretching of the chains. The
presence of water, however, suppresses the electrostatic repulsion
among ionene charges. We calculated the HOMO, LUMO, and electronic
band gap of various HMT-PMBIs. More positive charge on the backbone
leads to a decrease, by about 2.0 and 3.0 eV, of the band gaps of
HMT-PMBI+ and HMT-PMBI2+ relative to that for
the neutral polymer, respectively. Consistently, in the TD-DFT study,
it was seen that the absorption spectrum of the methylated repeating
units is red-shifted relative to the neutral ones.

Studying
the single chain behavior is a prerequisite for studying
self-organization in concentrated solutions of polybenzimidazole ionenes.
Studies performed and reported here reveal important trends in this
regard, and they could thus form the basis for further modeling and
simulation of ionene self-aggregation, network formation, ion and
solvent transport, and the development of a statistical model of fracture
formation in ionene-based membranes. Insights on the conformational
properties of ionenes with varying degree of methylation is important
for better understanding the charge transport behavior in ionene solution.
We hope that this study would prompt further fundamental investigations
on conformational properties of benzimidazolium compounds.

4 Computational Details
Calculations
in this work have been performed with Gaussian 16.34 We performed DFT calculations from the monomer
to the pentamer of HMT-PMBI. The HMT-PMBI repeating unit with 50%
degree of methylation is electroneutral, while 75 and 100% degrees
of methylation correspond to the charge +1 and +2, respectively.25 We calculated the electronic band gap, Egap, which is defined as the minimal energy
difference between HOMO and LUMO levels.

All structures were
fully optimized to find the ground state energy.
The condition for attaining the ground state is satisfied when the
gradient of the total energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates
is zero. The convergence criterion for the calculation is as follows:34 the maximum component of the total force must
be below a cutoff value of 0.00045 N; the root-mean-square of the
force below 0.0003 N; the calculated displacement for the next step
below a cutoff value of 0.0018 Å; and the root-mean-square of
the displacement for the next step below 0.0012 Å. We employed
the 6-31G(d) basis set.

We tested various functionals for calculating
the HOMO, LUMO, and Egap, including B97D,
Grimme’s functional
with the dispersion correction;35 the PBE
functional, which is at the GGA level;36 the TPSS functional, which is a nonempirical meta-GGA;37 O3LYP29 and B3LYP38 hybrid functionals, which are very similar but
have slightly different mixing coefficients; PBE1, which is also a
hybrid exchange–correlation functional based on the GGA PBE;39 and wB97XD,40 which
is known as a range-separated functional that includes Grimme’s
D2 dispersion model35 to capture both short-range
interactions and long-range corrections. Our main motive for testing
these seven DFT functionals was to explore how well they can describe
the electronic properties of the ionene system in comparison to the
B3LYP functional, which is the only functional used to date for this
system.28

Using TD-DFT,41 we extracted excited-state
data and generated UV–vis absorption spectra. Solvent effects
were investigated by optimizing the tetramer structures in the presence
of implicit water using the PCM.26,27 GaussView
6.0 visualization software was used to generate the input structures
and display the output geometries and orbitals.42
