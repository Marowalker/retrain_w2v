Titanium tert-butoxy halides of the formula CpxTiXy(OtBu)4–(x+y) (x, y = 1, 2; X = Cl, Br)
have been prepared thorough milling the reagents without solvent.
In the case of the chloride derivatives, Cp2TiCl2 is used as a starting material; in the case of the bromides, a mixture
of LiCp, TiBr4, and Li[OtBu]
is used. The stoichiometric ratios of the starting materials are reflected
in the major products of the reactions. Single-crystal X-ray structures
are reported for Cp2TiCl(OtBu), Cp2TiBr(OtBu), and CpTiBr2(OtBu), as well as for Cp2TiCl(OiPr) and a redetermination
of Cp2TiCl(OMe). The tert-butoxy derivatives
are notable for their nearly linear Ti–O–C angles (>170°)
that reflect Ti–O π-bonding, an interpretation supported
with density functional theory calculations.

1 Introduction
The
neutral d0 Cpx′MLyL4–(x+y)′ framework comprises
an enormous number of complexes in early transition-metal and actinide
chemistry.1 This is the result of the combinatorial
possibilities within the basic metallocene structure, coupled with
an extended range of compatible L and L′ ligands. Many applications
have been developed for such complexes, mainly in catalysis (e.g.,
syndiotactic polymerization of styrene,2 alkyne hydroamination,3 olefin polymerization,4−13 including copolymerization, e.g., of ethylene/norbornene,14,15 polymerization of lactide monomers and ε-caprolactone16−18), but there are also uses in organic synthesis19−22 and for the chemical vapor deposition
production of thin-film oxides23,24 and carbides.25

The richness of the synthetic landscape
of these complexes can
be appreciated by considering a subset of complexes in which the cyclopentadienyl
ligand is the unsubstituted C5H5, L′
is a halide, and L″ is an alkoxide. Not counting the homoleptic
complexes MX4, M(OR)4, and MCp4,
12 general compositions can satisfy the CpxMXy(OR)4–(x+y) formula (Figure 1). The very flexibility that makes the metallocene
framework so versatile, however, can also complicate the synthesis
of specific compositions. Remarkably, for the specific set with M
= Ti, X = Cl, and R = tBu, all of the
possible compounds with the exception of Cp2TiCl(OtBu) are known.26 This is one of the most complete such families, however. With
the sole change of Cl to Br, for example, none of the heteroleptic
CpxTiBry(OtBu)4–(x+y) or TiBrx(OtBu)4–x complexes
has been described. Even when known, the assembly of particular ligand
sets in a Cp2MLL′ complex is not always straightforward.
The dichlorides Cp2MCl2 are commonly used starting
materials for bis(cyclopentadienyl) derivatives, but the reaction
of Cp2TiCl2 and 2 equiv Li[OtBu] in tetrahydrofuran (THF) yields not only Cp2Ti(OtBu)2 (61%) but also CpTi(OtBu)3 (26%) and Ti(OtBu)4 (13%).26f Similarly, the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 and (Li
or Na)[OtBu] yields an inseparable mixture
of Cp2ZrCl(OtBu) and Cp2Zr(OtBu)2, even with
the use of more than 2 equiv of the alkoxide.23

possibilities of mixed group 4 CpxMXy(OR)4–(x+y) complexes, starting from the homoleptic
species MX4, M(OR)4, and MCp4. Complexes
in the interior represent conceptual blends of the compounds on the
edges.

The formation and disruption of
Ti–O bonds has been of particular
interest because although such bonds are typically rather robust (e.g.,
ca. 90 kcal mol–1 in various Cp2Ti(OR)2 complexes),28 their strength depends
markedly on the metal oxidation state and the identity of other ligands
on the metal center.29−31 In general, increased electron density on the metal
center is associated with weaker Ti–O bond strength. Thus,
the Ti–O energy in the Ti(IV) complex Ti(OtBu)4 has been placed at 108 kcal mol–1, whereas in the Ti(III) species Cp2TiCl(TEMPO) [TEMPO
= (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl)], the bond
strength is calculated at 17 kcal mol–1.31 The ready scission of the Ti(III)–TEMPO
bond has been exploited synthetically for the formation of CpTiCl(OR)2 (R = complexes).32

In contrast
to the solution-based methods described above, we recently
explored the use of mechanochemical methods in the preparation of
CpxMCly(OtBu)4–(x+y) (M = Ti, Zr, and Hf) complexes.26f Mechanochemical synthesis, which typically employs grinding
or milling, usually under solvent-free conditions, has been investigated
for the preparation of organic,33 inorganic,34−37 and organometallic compounds.38 Such
reactions can occur on a much faster time scale than equivalent solution
methods.39 Part of the reason for this
is the much higher concentration of reagents in the solid state than
is the case in solution. Solvents can also coordinate to reagents
and interfere with their subsequent reactivity or stabilize intermediates
that require more time to form products.40 Mechanochemistry may yield unique products that cannot be isolated
from solution-based approaches.41,42 The distribution of
products and isomers can also be tuned.26f,43,44 In addition, the solvent-free approach provides
flexibility to use reagents that are not compatible with typical organic
solvents, especially ethers. As demonstrated below, this proves to
be valuable in work with titanium halides. We report here mechanochemical
routes to CpxTiCly(OtBu)4–(x+y) (X = Cl, Br) complexes, with solution
syntheses of methoxy45 and isopropoxy derivatives
added for comparison.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
Preliminary attempts to
prepare Cp2TiCl(OMe)45 (1) and the previously unknown Cp2TiCl(OiPr) (2) through grinding Cp2TiCl2 with the appropriate alkali metal alkoxide did not
produce clean results, and hence, for these two compounds, we turned
to alcoholysis reactions in THF with an added base.46 This approach has been used with both bis(cyclopentadienyl)47 and mono(cyclopentadienyl)titanium26h complexes and provides control over substitution,
as indicated in eq 1 (n = 2 or 3; R = Me, Et, and iPr) for the latter compounds.26h For this
study, we used Cp2TiCl2 as a starting material,
which is inexpensive and its chloride ligands are substitutable. 1  

The methoxy derivative 1 has been described before45 but its synthesis
was given without details. The new isoproxy derivative 2 is an orange solid with the expected 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The ethoxy derivative has been previously synthesized,47,49 but it was useful for comparative studies (see below) and was also
prepared via the literature solution method.

These solution
reactions are slow (ca. 16 h) and even then may
be incomplete,47 and for the synthesis
of the tert-butoxy derivative Cp2TiCl(OtBu) (3), we investigated halide
metathesis instead. This approach has been used to form Cp2ZrCl(OtBu) in THF,23 although the solution route fails for Cp2HfCl(OtBu).26f Mechanochemical
activation works successfully with both of the heavier group 4 metals
and it was adopted for the preparation of 3. At the outset,
we were not confident that the reaction would be selective, as our
previous investigation into tert-butoxide substitution
with Cp2TiCl2 demonstrated that at ratios of
[OtBu]−/Cp2TiCl2 ≥ 2, mixtures of products were obtained whose
composition depended on whether or not solvent was used in the reaction
and if so, whether it was an alkane or an ether.26f Nevertheless, we proceeded with the assumption that the
composition of the desired product could be generated from the corresponding
ratio of starting materials, that is, 1 equivalent of [OtBu]− would replace one Cl– or Br–. With the use of an equimolar ratio of
K[OtBu] to Cp2TiCl2, in fact, grinding in a planetary mill for 15 min at 600 rpm did
yield solid orange 3 exclusively. This result parallels
those with Zr and Hf. The formation of 3, which completes
the set of CpxTiXy(OtBu)4–(x+y) compounds for X = Cl and R = tBu (Figure 1), has been proposed as an intermediary in the formation of
Cp3Ti(OtBu) from Cp2TiCl2 and K[OtBu] and LiCp
(eq 2).26f Its isolation raises the reasonableness of this route. 2  

The scarcity
of organotitanium bromides stems from a lack of readily
accessible starting materials. The solid TiBr4 would be
a logical choice but it reacts with ethereal solvents at room temperature
(in the case of THF, with ring cleavage).50 The adduct TiBr4(thf)2 has been used in the
preparation of some titanium complexes, but its preparation requires
a low-temperature (−78 °C) reaction between TiBr4 and THF followed by several days of vacuum drying to obtain a solid
product. The resulting material is not soluble in THF, CHCl3, or CCl4.50 Even if it were,
such solvents are problematic from an environmental viewpoint and
move the traditional route even farther away from a “green”
approach to synthesis.51 Thus, a mechanochemical
route seemed especially suitable for the preparation of alkoxybromo
derivatives. Rather than starting with Cp2TiBr2, which itself can be made from Cp2TiCl2 and
LiBr,52 the one-pot synthesis of Cp2TiBr(OtBu) (4) was
accomplished by milling TiBr4, Li[OtBu], and LiCp in a 1:1:2 M ratio for 15 min (eq 3) 3  

Adjusting the reaction
stoichiometry of TiBr4, Li[OtBu], and LiCp to 1:1:1 and 1:2:1 ratios forms
CpTiBr2(OtBu) (5) and CpTiBr(OtBu)2 (6), respectively. Perhaps not surprisingly, compound 5, formed from the simplest ratio of reagents, is the bromo
complex that is consistently formed most cleanly. In contrast, the
formation of 4 is also accompanied by 6 (ca.
56%); crystals 4 can be obtained from hexanes. Compound 6, in turn, which is produced with a larger amount of the tert-butoxide than is 5, is usually accompanied
by the homoleptic alkoxide Ti(OtBu)4 (ca. 30%). Such differences reflect the role that kinetic
factors play in mechanochemical synthesis, as grinding and milling
environments are often far from equilibrium,53−56 and it is not uncommon to observe
mixtures of the kinetically preferred products from solid-state reactions.

All of the compounds 1–6 are air-
and moisture-sensitive and are soluble in hydrocarbons.

2.2 Crystal Structures
Crystals of 1 and 2 that were suitable for X-ray diffraction
were grown from toluene; those for 3–5 were grown from hexanes. Comparative listings of selected bond lengths
and angles are found in Table 1.

2.2.1 Cp2TiCl(OMe)
(1)
An X-ray structure determination of 1 has been reported.45 The room-temperature
(295 K) structure was affected
by disorder in the Cp rings that could not be satisfactorily modeled.
Interestingly, in the present low-temperature version, which crystallizes
in the same space group (Pbca), the Cp rings are
not disordered but there is a second chlorine position possibly arising
from cocrystallized Cp2TiCl2; its occupancy
is refined (9%) with a Ti–Cl bond similarity restraint. Its
presence may be the result of incomplete alcoholysis, a difficulty
that has been observed before with this synthetic method.47 Nevertheless, both the original and our low-temperature
redetermination agree on the pseudotetrahedral nature of the molecule,
defined by the centroids of the two Cp rings, the chloride, and the
oxygen of the methyl group (Figure 2). The Ti–Cl, Ti–O, and Ti-ring centroid
distances in the two structures differ by less than 0.01 Å and
the Cl–Ti–O angles differ by only 0.19°. The major
difference involves the methoxy ligand; the O1–C11 bond distance
is 0.05 Å longer in the present structure and the Ti–O–C
bond angle has contracted by 2.9°. The low-temperature structure
parameters are more in line with those of Cp2TiCl(OEt).49 For example, the C–O distance in the
ethoxy derivative [1.415(4) Å] is not statistically distinguishable
from that in the low-temperature 1 and the Ti–O–C
angles, although differing by 5.3°, are closer than the ethoxy/room-temp
methoxy values (Δ = 8.2°).

Figure 2 Thermal ellipsoid plot of 1 (50% level); hydrogens
have arbitrary radii. A second chloride (2.326 Å from Ti, see
text) has been removed for clarity. Selected bond distances (Å)
and angles (deg): Ti1–O1, 1.8300(19); Ti1–Cl1, 2.4215(3);
O1–C11, 1.419(2); Ti–Cp′ (ring centroid), 2.083
(ave); O1–Ti1–Cl1, 93.61(5); Ti1–O1–C11,
138.53(13); and Cp–Ti–Cp′, 130.9.

As a result of the unusual ordering of geometric
parameters in
the previously reported Cp2TiCl(OEt) structure relative
to 1 and 2 (see below), Cp2TiCl(OEt)
was resynthesized (see Experimental Section) and its structure was redetermined (see Supporting Information). Crystals were grown in view of the possibility
that a polymorph might exist with a different Ti–O length and/or
Ti–O–C angle. Although the new crystals were twinned,
unlike those used for the earlier determination, all of the relevant
structural parameters of the two structures agree to within 1σ
(see Table 1).

2.2.2 Cp2TiCl(OiPr) (2)
Compound 2 shares
the same pseudotetrahedral structure as 1 and Cp2TiCl(OEt); in the case of 2, both the Cp rings
and OiPr ligand are disordered. One set
of these is depicted in Figure 3. In particular, the alkoxide ligand is disordered across
a crystallographically imposed mirror plane, that is, Cl1, Ti1, O1,
C7, and C8 all lie in the plane and C6 is disordered above and below
it (50:50). The general details of 2 mimic those of 1, in that the Ti-ring centroid distances differ only by 0.03
Å and the Ti–Cl bond lengths are within 0.02 Å of
each other. Some details of the geometry of the isopropoxy ligand
suggest a change in the metal ligand bonding compared to that in 1 and Cp2TiCl(OEt). The Ti–O bond has shortened
to 1.802(3) Å and the Ti–O–C angle has widened
to 160.0(3)°, features that could be consistent with some π-bonding
character between Ti and the isopropoxy oxygen. The C–O distance
of 1.309(6) Å, however, although not an unprecedented value for
such a bond,57 is nearly 0.1 Å shorter
than that found in any of the other complexes in this study. It also
is not supported by computational modeling (see below), suggesting
that the ligand disorder has unrealistically shortened it. Other features
may have been altered by the disorder as well.

and cyclopentadienyl ligands is shown. Selected bond distances (Å)
and angles (deg): Ti1–O1, 1.802(3); Ti1–Cl1, 2.4031(16);

(ave); O1–Ti1–Cl1, 94.87(13); Ti1–O1–C6,
160.0(3); and Cp–Ti–Cp′, 129.0.

2.2.3 Cp2TiCl(OtBu) (3)
Compound 3 is not
affected by the disorder problems in 1 and 2 and interpretation of its structural features is more straightforward
(Figure 4). The molecule
has the same pseudotetrahedral geometry displayed by 1 and 2, but 3 can probably be compared
most directly with the [Cp2Ti(OtBu)(thf)]+ cation;58 the Ti–O
bond of 1.806(4) Å and Ti–O–C angle of 166.9(3)°
of the latter differ by 0.02 Å and 5.6°, respectively, from
that of 3. Comparisons are also possible with the structure
of Cp2TiCl(OEt), which has been suggested as representing
a sterically unencumbered Cp2TiCl(OR) complex.49 The Ti–Cp (centroid) distances and Cp–Ti–Cp′
angles in the two complexes differ by only 0.016 Å and 1.0°,
respectively. The Ti–Cl distances are also nearly identical
(0.005 Å difference) and are ca. 0.04 Å longer than those
in Cp2TiCl2.59

plot of 3 (50% level); hydrogens
have arbitrary radii. Selected bond distances (Å) and angles
(deg): Ti1–O1, 1.7864(9); Ti1–Cl1, 2.4101(4); O1–C11,
1.4204(14); Ti–Cp′ (ring centroid), 2.103 (ave); O1–Ti1–Cl1,
94.40(3); Ti1–O1–C11, 172.48(8); and Cp–M–Cp′,
129.5.

The differences between 3 and Cp2TiCl(OEt),
however, are the most revealing. The Ti–O–C angle in 3 is 172.5°, 39.3° wider than that in Cp2TiCl(OEt), and which to our knowledge is the widest such angle reported
for a Cp2TiCl(OR) complex.60 It might be thought that, given the bulk of the OtBu ligand, there could be some steric influence on this value,
but the closest intramolecular contact between a methyl carbon atom
of the OtBu group and a Cp carbon is at
3.49 Å (C8···C13). Although the comparison is
not exact, in Cp2TiCl(OEt), the methylene carbon displays
nearest contacts at 3.15 and 3.23 Å to Cp carbon atoms. More
telling is the short (1.786 Å) Ti–O bond distance in 3, compared to the 1.855 Å distance in the ethoxide.
There is clearly no steric impediment to adopting the very short Ti–O
distance in 3 and it would seem that the OtBu group is serving as a strong π donor in
this complex.

2.2.4 Cp2TiBr(OtBu) (4)
There are two
crystallographically
independent but closely similar molecules in the unit cell; only molecule
“A” will be discussed here. Not unexpectedly, the bromoalkoxy
derivative 4 (Figure 5) is isostructural with the chloroalkoxy derivative 3. They share the same pseudotetrahedral framework, with closely
similar Ti–Cp (centroid) distances (<0.01 Å difference).
The Ti–Br bond length in 4 matches that in Cp2TiBr2 exactly61 and
is 0.12 Å longer than the Ti–Cl distance in 3, which is slightly less than the difference in covalent radii (0.18
Å).62 The tert-butoxy
ligand bonding is also similar to that in 3, as measured
by the Ti–O and O–C distances and the Ti–O–C
angle (0.012, 0.006 Å, and 3.3° difference, respectively).
The differences, although small, are in a direction that indicates
that the bromide ligand provides less competition for π-bonding
to the metal than does the more electronegative chloride. This is
reflected in the contraction of the Ti–O bond and the widening
of the Ti–O–C angle in 4 compared to 3. There is even less reason to posit any steric influence
on the wide Ti–O–C angle in 4 (175.8°),
as the closest intramolecular contact between a carbon atom of the
OtBu group and a Cp carbon is now at 3.68
Å (C1···C14).

84.67(16); Ti1–O1–C11, 175.8(3); and Cp–Ti–Cp′,
128.8.

2.2.5 CpTiBr2(OtBu) (5)
Similar to 4, there
are two crystallographically independent but closely similar molecules
in the unit cell of 5; only molecule “A”
will be discussed here. Also similar to 4, compound 5 has a pseudotetrahedral geometry, with one of the Cp rings
of 4 replaced with another Br (Figure 6). The molecule possesses approximate, although
not crystallographically imposed, Cs symmetry; the atoms C5, Ti1, O1, C6, and C8 are all within
0.03 Å of a least-squares plane drawn through their centers.
Consistent with the reduced coordination number, all of the distances
to the metal have decreased relative to 4. The Ti–Cp
(centroid) distance is smaller in 5 by 0.067 Å and
the Ti–Br distances are 0.10 Å shorter. The already short
Ti–O distance in 4 is now reduced by 0.047 Å to
1.727 Å. The Ti–O–C angle in 5 is
173.9°, slightly but not appreciably different from the value
in 4.

2.3 Metal–Alkoxide
Bonding
The
new complexes described here provide a basis for re-examining the
long-standing issue of the unusual geometries displayed by terminal
transition-metal alkoxides.63 It was noted
over 20 years ago that many such alkoxides of the second- and third-row
early transition metals and the lanthanides (e.g., Zr, Nb, Ta, and
Sm) possess nearly linear M–O–R angles and short M–O
distances, although there is no direct correlation between the distances
and angles.64,65 Several sources for the linear
structures have been proposed, including steric crowding (bulkier
alkoxides tend to display more linear M–O–R angles),
π-bonding between occupied p orbitals of the oxygen and empty
metal orbitals, or conversely, ionic interactions (i.e., Mδ+ORδ−).65 A role
has also been assigned to electrostatic repulsion between the α-carbon
of the alkoxide and the metal centers.66 Confounding these explanations are difficulties with solid-state
artifacts in crystallographic structures, that is, crystal packing
effects and disordered ligands, which can obscure inferences made
about bonding arrangements.

Even if a largely ionic interaction
is a primary bonding contributor for the heavier metal alkoxides,
the situation with the early first-row metals is not necessarily the
same. A broad range of M–O–R angles has been observed
in first-row alkoxide complexes, although as with the heavier metals,
correlation between M–O distances and M–O–C angles
is essentially nonexistent. For example, even when restricting examples
to complexes comparable to those in the present study, that is, mononuclear
Ti(IV) species with terminal tert-butoxide ligands,
a plot of Ti–O distances versus Ti–O–C angles
is effectively a random scatter (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Ti–O distances vs Ti–O–C
angles in mononuclear
Ti(IV) tert-butoxide complexes. Compounds from the
present study are marked in red and are detailed in Table 1. Data are from the Cambridge
Crystallographic Database.67

Such randomness affects the plausibility of certain
explanations
for the observed Ti–O–C angles. For example, the steric
bulk of the −OtBu ligand, which
is obviously a fixed value, is not always accompanied by wide (ca.
>160°) Ti–O–C bond angles. In addition, even
the
longest Ti–O bond in the set of complexes [1.825(4) Å]
in (OPy)2Ti(OtBu)2 (OPy = 2-pyridylmethoxy68) is well below
the sum of the covalent radii of Ti and O (2.09 Å), making an
ionic contribution to the bonding reasonable for all of the complexes.

The just-mentioned (OPy)2Ti(OtBu)2 complex, which possesses two independent (nonsymmetry
related) tert-butoxide ligands, also illustrates
the importance of packing effects on experimentally determined bond
distances and angles. Specifically, there are two independent molecules
in its asymmetric unit68 and between the
four alkoxide ligands, the Ti–O bonds range from 1.790 Å
to the previously noted 1.825 Å; the Ti–O–C angles
vary from 142.4° to 162.2°. The large difference in angles
(Δ = 19.8°) for the small change in bond lengths (Δ
= 0.035 Å) underscores why correlation between the two variables
cannot be expected to be strong, if it exists at all.

Even apart
from such experimental difficulties, the alkoxide ligand
is notoriously ambivalent in its bonding.69,70 Depending on how the lone pairs on the oxygen interact with the
metal, single, double, and (weak) triple covalent bonding can be envisaged
or a purely ionic representation can be drawn as well; the latter
two forms are consistent with wide M–O–R angles (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Bonding arrangements
for the alkoxide ligand. Forms (a) and (b)
represent single and double bonds, respectively; forms (c) and (d)
are both compatible with near linear M–O–R bonds.

We were interested in the opportunity
that the present set of complexes
offered for illuminating the bonding involved in the CpxTiXy(OR)4–(x+y) series. Calculations on isolated
molecules remove the ambiguities of crystal packing effects, of course,
and also provide the opportunity to look for orbital evidence of M–L
π-bonding.

2.4 Computational Results
Even considering
the vagaries of crystal packing effects, preliminary density functional
theory (DFT) calculations using the M0671 and APF-D72 global hybrid functionals
provided somewhat disappointing reproductions of the crystallographic
structures. Tests with the double hybrid B2PLYP functional,73 which incorporates perturbative second-order
correlation (PT2) obtained from the Kohn–Sham (GGA) orbitals
and eigenvalues, were more encouraging and were used for subsequent
studies. Not unexpectedly, reproducing angles is more difficult than
bond distances (Table 1). Specific points about individual molecules are listed below.

2.4.1 Cp2TiCl(OMe) (1)
Although the
calculated Ti–O–C angle of 136.8°
is 4.6° smaller than that in the original room-temperature structure
determination, it is only 1.7° smaller than that in the present
redetermined low-temperature geometry, providing confidence that the
latter is the more reliable figure.

2.4.2 Cp2TiCl(OiPr) (2)
The wide Ti–O–C
angle of 160.0° found in the crystal structure cannot be reproduced
by the B2PLYP calculations, which underestimates it by 12.3°
[the underestimation is larger (15.4°) with the M06 functional],
but the large difference supports the conclusion that the crystallographically
observed value, suffering as it does from disorder both in the isopropoxy
group and cyclopentadienyl rings, cannot be used uncritically. Other
features of the molecule not directly involved in the disorder may
be affected as well. The calculated Ti–Cl bond, for example,
is 0.16 Å shorter than the crystallographically observed value.

2.4.3 Cp2TiCl(OtBu) (3)
The calculated Ti–O–C
angle is smaller than the crystallographic value by 4.5° and
the Ti–Cl and Ti–O bonds are in good agreement, with
a mismatch of only 0.016 Å (under) and 0.014 Å (over), respectively.

2.4.4 Cp2TiBr(OtBu) (4)
The calculated Ti–O–C
angle underestimates the crystallographic value by 5.2°; the
Ti–Br and Ti–O bonds are slightly overestimated by 0.051
and 0.023 Å, respectively.

2.4.5 CpTiBr2(OtBu) (5)
The calculated Ti–O–C
angle is larger than the crystallographic value by 5.0°; the
Ti–Br and Ti–O bonds display good agreement, with a
difference of only 0.003 Å (under) and 0.028 Å (over), respectively.

2.5 π-Bonding in Cyclopentadienyl Alkoxide
Complexes
When there is no evidence for steric crowding or
crystallographic disorder, a wide M–O–C angle accompanied
by a shortened M–O bond is consistent with metal–ligand
π-bonding.74 Three of the new compounds
reported here, 3, 4, and 5,
meet these structural criteria, as they have Ti–O–C
angles >170° and Ti–O bonds of <1.80 Å. The
bonding
in 3 and 5 is discussed in detail.

An inspection of selected orbitals of 3 makes it obvious
that two of them display evidence of π-bonding between Ti and
O (Figure 9; the x axis is coincident with the Ti–O bond; the Cl lies
in the xz plane). In MO#69 [highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) – 6, Figure 9a], Ti is involved in sigma bonding to Cl as well as
π-type bonding to the oxygen. A natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis
of the composition indicates that for oxygen, 98% of its contribution
to the MO is from its 2pz orbital.
For Ti, both its 3dz2 and 3dxz orbitals are involved, in a ratio of roughly
3:5. In MO#68 (HOMO – 7, Figure 9b), Ti is again involved in π-type bonding to
the oxygen. The contribution from oxygen is 30.5% of the total MO
and 99% of this is from the 2py orbital.
Almost 84% of the contribution of titanium is from the 3dxy orbital, with smaller amounts from 3dyz. Much lower in energy (MO#48) are orbitals that
represent Ti–O sigma bonding (Figure 9c) and the C–H bonds in the OtBu ligand. More than 95% of the contribution
of oxygen to the MO is from the 2px orbital. Most of the contribution of titanium is from the 3dx2–y2 orbital.

Figure 9 (a) MO#69 of Cp2TiCl(OtBu).
(b) MO#68 of Cp2TiCl(OtBu).
The isodensity surface for the two orbitals is 0.050. (c) MO#48 of
Cp2TiCl(OtBu); isodensity surface
= 0.025.

A similar arrangement of orbitals
exists for 5. In
MO#76 (HOMO – 8, Figure 10a), Ti is involved in σ-bonding to Cl as well
as π-type bonding to the oxygen. NBO analysis of the composition
indicates that for oxygen, over 99% of its contribution to MO is from
its 2py orbital. For Ti, 88% of its contribution
is from the 3dxy orbital. Complementary
Ti–O π-bonding is found in MO#75 (HOMO – 9, Figure 10b), in which over
99% of the contribution of oxygen is from its 2pz orbital; almost 85% of the contribution of oxygen is from
the 3dxz orbital, with 10.5% from the
4pz. As is the case with 3, the Ti–O σ interaction is substantially lower in energy
(Figure 10c). In MO#57,
the overlap is again primarily between the oxygen 2px orbital and the Ti 3dx2–y2 orbital.

(b) MO#75 of CpTiBr2(OtBu).
The isodensity surface for the two orbitals is 0.050. (c) MO#57 of
CpTiBr2(OtBu); isodensity surface
= 0.035.

The bonding picture presented
here is closely related to that developed
for the monocyclopentadienyl CpTiMe2((O,S)Ar) complexes.75 For the arylsulfide CpTiMe2(SAr),
a straightforward Lewis structure based on an sp3-hybridized
sulfur atom was sufficient to explain the bonding and geometrical
arrangement of the Ti–SAr interaction. For the aryloxide analogue,
in contrast, it was not possible to draw a satisfactory bonding picture
in terms of a single classical Lewis structure and a resonance blend
of forms c (with an sp-hybridized oxygen) and d (Figure 8) was proposed instead. It
seems that the same situation largely applies to the present tert-butoxide complexes (Figure 11).

Figure 11 Limiting bonding arrangements for Cp2TiCl(OtBu). Both extremes support a linear
Ti–O–C
bond angle.

Estimation of the covalency/ionicity
in the Ti–O interaction
in the alkoxide complexes is not straightforward. Natural population
charges are relatively insensitive to basis set composition76 and that on Ti is 0.56 and 0.49 for 3 and 5, respectively. These are higher than the values
of 0.12 and 0.06 for Cp2TiCl2 and Cp2TiBr2, respectively, and reflect the electron-withdrawing
effect of the more electronegative oxygen and thus a greater ionic
contribution to a resonance blend. Although as noted above, the Ti–O
bond distances (1.73–1.79 for 3–5) are far shorter than the sum of single-bond covalent radii (2.09
Å), they are close to the sum of double-bond radii (1.74
Å).77 The Mayer bond order (MBO)78,79 for the Ti–O bond of 3 and 5 is
1.08 and 1.23, respectively, suggestive of at least a full single
bond. In contrast, the “fuzzy” bond order (FBO)80 (numerically the same as the delocalization
index calculated in “fuzzy” atomic space81 and intended to reflect the number of electron
pairs delocalized (shared) between two atomic spaces) of 3 and 5 is 1.80 and 2.07, respectively. As the MBO can
tend to underestimate the total bond order and the FBO can overestimate
it,80 assigning an approximate bond order
of ∼1.5 seems reasonable.

3 Conclusions
Mechanochemical synthesis can be used to produce CpxTiXy(OtBu)4–(x+y) (X = Cl, Br) complexes from the mixture of two or three starting
materials, depending on whether bis(cyclopentadienyl) or mono(cyclopentadienyl)
compounds are desired. Adjustment of the stoichiometric ratios of
the reagents is reflected in the composition of the major products,
although the outcomes are cleanest if the ratios are 1:1 (as in the
production of 3) or 1:1:1 (as in the formation of 5). One noticeable advantage of the mechanochemical approach
is that TiBr4, which reacts at room temperature with ethereal
solvents, can be used in the solid state without modification. This
probably applies to solid TiI4 as well and should make
the synthesis of titanium-bromo and -iodo complexes more accessible,
while also minimizing the use of solvents with environmental concerns.

All of the tert-butoxide complexes display the
hallmarks of π-bonding between the titanium and alkoxide ligand,
that is, short Ti–O bonds and wide (>170°) Ti–O–C
angles. DFT calculations support this interpretation of the bonding,
with a total bond order between 1 and 2.

It is notable that
the calculations support an increasingly linear
Ti–O–C angle in the order Me < Et < OiPr < OtBu, which comports
with the increasing π-donor ability of the ligands. The X-ray
crystal structures in general support this ordering, with the notable
exception of the ethoxy complex Cp2TiCl(OEt), whose Ti–O–C
angle is the smallest of those studied here. We are at present unsure
of the reason for this difference, unless crystal packing effects
have a larger than expected influence on the geometry.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Considerations
All manipulations
were performed with the exclusion of air and moisture using high vacuum,
Schlenk, or glovebox techniques. All of the solid reagents are slightly
to highly moisture-sensitive and/or air-sensitive and should be handled
accordingly. Proton and carbon (13C(1H)) NMR
spectra were obtained on a DRX-400 spectrometer at 400 (1H) and 100.1 (13C) MHz and were referenced to the residual
proton and 13C resonances of C6D6. Elemental analysis was performed by ALS, Tucson, AZ.

4.2 Materials
TiBr4, LiOtBu, KOtBu, LiCp,
and Cp2TiCl2 were purchased from commercial
suppliers and used as received. Toluene and hexanes were distilled
under nitrogen from potassium benzophenone ketyl.82 Anhydrous THF was stored over molecular sieves. MeOH was
obtained from MB-SPS. Isopropyl alcohol and triethylamine (TEA) were
distilled and dried over CaH2. C6D6 was vacuum-distilled from Na/K (22/78) alloy and stored over type
4A molecular sieves prior to use. Cp2TiCl(OEt) was prepared
according to the literature procedure.49

4.3 Mechanochemical Protocol
Ball-milling
reactions used 50 stainless steel (440 grade) ball bearings [3/16
in. (5 mm), 0.44 g] that were thoroughly cleaned with hexanes and
acetone prior to use. Planetary milling was performed with a Retsch
PM100 mill, 50 mL stainless steel grinding jar type C, and a safety
clamp for air-sensitive grinding. A typical reaction involved 300
mg total sample weight, sealed under an inert atmosphere. The ground
mixture was extracted with minimal hexanes (<100 mL) and filtered
through a medium porosity ground glass frit. The extraction is designed
to dissolve the complex and the filtration removes traces of KCl or
KBr. The filtrate was then dried under vacuum prior to NMR analysis.
In the case of TiBr4 reactions, TiBr4 was added
to the grinding jar first, followed by LiCp and then Li[OtBu]; this is to prevent the solid-state reaction
of the alkoxide with TiBr4.

4.3.1 Cp2TiCl(OMe) (1)
This was prepared following
the literature procedure.45 Cp2TiCl2 (0.502 g, 2.01
mmol) was added to a Schlenk flask containing 40 mL of THF and a magnetic
stirrer bar. This was stirred at room temperature under N2. To this mixture, TEA (0.52 mL, 3.7 mmol) and MeOH (0.16 mL, 3.9
mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room
temperature for 16 h. THF was removed in vacuo. The resulting product
was then extracted with toluene to yield an orange filtrate. Toluene
was removed to afford 0.441 g (90% yield) of an orange solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, C6D6, 298 K): δ
4.06 ppm (s, 3H, CH3), δ 5.88 (s, 10H, C5H5). 13C NMR (100 MHz, C6D6, 298 K): δ 70.7 (s, OCH3), δ 117.0 (s, C5H5).

4.3.2 Cp2TiCl(OiPr) (2)
Cp2TiCl2 (0.500 g, 2.01 mmol) was added to a Schlenk flask
containing 40
mL of THF and a magnetic stirrer bar. This was stirred at room temperature
under N2. To this mixture, TEA (0.29 mL, 2.08 mmol) and iPrOH (0.16 mL, 2.08 mmol) were added. The
reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 16 h.
THF was removed in vacuo. The resulting product was then extracted
with hexanes and filtered through a medium porosity glass-fritted
glass filter. Hexane was removed, leaving an orange solid (0.241 g,
44%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, C6D6, 298
K): δ 1.03 (d, 6H, CH(CH3)2), δ 4.48 (sept, 1H, J = 6 Hz, CH(CH3)2), δ 5.88 (s, 10H, C5H5). 13C NMR (100 MHz, C6D6, 298 K): δ 25.5 (s, CH(CH3)2), δ 84.1 (s, CH(CH3)2), 116.5 (s, C5H5). Anal. Calcd for
C13H17ClOTi: C, 57.3; H, 6.3; Ti, 17.6. Found:

Cp2TiCl2 (0.249 g, 1.00 mmol), K[OtBu] (0.113
g, 1.01 mmol), and 50 ball bearings were added to a grinding jar.
The jar was sealed under an inert atmosphere and the reaction mixture
was ground at 600 rpm for 15 min. Upon completion, the jar was opened
under an inert atmosphere to reveal an orange solid which was then
extracted with minimal hexanes and filtered through a fritted glass
filter. The resulting orange filtrate was then dried, resulting in
an orange solid (0.181 g, 63%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, C6D6, 298 K): δ 1.12 (s, 9H, OC(CH3)3), δ 5.94 (s, 10H, C5H5). 13C NMR (100 MHz, C6D6, 298 K): δ
31.3 (s, CH3), δ 87.8 (s OC(CH3)3), 116.6 (s, C5H5). Anal.

mmol), Li[OtBu] (0.101 g, 1.26 mmol),
LiCp (0.177 g, 2.46 mmol), and 50 ball bearings were added to a grinding
jar. The jar was sealed under an inert atmosphere and the reaction
mixture was ground at 600 rpm for 15 min. Upon completion, the jar
was opened under an inert atmosphere to reveal an orange solid which
was then extracted with minimal hexanes and filtered through a fritted
glass filter. The resulting filtrate was then dried, resulting in
an orange solid (0.214 g, 52%). The product also contains CpTiBr(OtBu)2; crystals of 4 can be obtained from hexanes. 1H NMR of 4 (400 MHz, C6D6, 298 K): δ 1.10 (s, 9H
OC(CH3)3), δ 5.92 (s, 10H, C5H5). 13C NMR (100 MHz, C6D6, 298 K); δ 31.2 (s, CH(CH3)2), δ 88.4 (s, CH(CH3)2), 116.2 (s, C5H5).

4.3.5 CpTiBr2(OtBu) (5)
TiBr4 (0.576 g, 1.57
mmol), Li[OtBu] (0.127 g, 1.59 mmol),
LiCp (0.114 g, 1.58 mmol), and 50 ball bearings were added to a grinding
jar. The jar was sealed under an inert atmosphere and the reaction
mixture was ground at 600 rpm for 15 min. Upon completion, the jar
was opened under an inert atmosphere to reveal a yellow-brown solid
which was then extracted with minimal hexanes and filtered through
a fritted glass filter. The resulting yellow filtrate was then dried,
resulting in a yellow solid (0.241 g, 44%). 1H NMR (400
MHz, C6D6, 298 K): δ 1.14 (s, 9H C4H9), δ 6.16 (s, 10H, C5H5). 13C NMR (100 MHz, C6D6, 298 K):

Calcd for C9H14Br2OTi: C, 31.25;
H, 4.08. Found: C, 31.42; H, 3.96.

4.3.6 CpTiBr(OtBu)2 (6)
TiBr4 (0.382 g, 1.04
mmol), Li[OtBu] (0.167 g, 2.09 mmol),
LiCp (0.0747 g, 1.04 mmol), and 50 ball bearings were added to a grinding
jar. The jar was sealed under an inert atmosphere and the reaction
mixture was ground at 600 rpm for 15 min. Upon completion, the jar
was opened under an inert atmosphere to reveal an orange paste that
was then extracted with minimal hexanes and filtered through a fritted
glass filter. The resulting yellow filtrate was then placed under
vacuum, resulting in an orange oil (0.217 g, 62%). Analysis with 1H NMR indicates that ca. 31% of the sample consisted of Ti(OtBu)4. 1H NMR of 6 (400 MHz, C6D6, 298 K): δ 1.19
(s, 18H, C4H9), δ 6.22 (s, 5H, C5H5). 13C (100 MHz, C6D6, 298 K): δ 31.8 (s, CH(CH3)2), δ 86.8 (s, CH(CH3)2), 115.0 (s, C5H5).

4.4 General Procedures for X-ray Crystallography
A suitable
crystal of each sample was located, mounted in a polyimide
loop, and mounted on an Agilent SuperNova (Dual, Cu at zero, EosS2)
diffractometer. The crystals were maintained at 100 K (223 K for 2) during data collection. Under Olex2,83 the structure was solved with the SHELXT84 structure solution program using direct methods and refined
with the SHELXL85 refinement package using
least squares minimization. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined with
anisotropic displacement parameters.

4.5 General
Procedures for Calculations
All calculations were performed
with the Gaussian 09W suite of programs.86 The double hybrid B2PLYP functional,73 which incorporates perturbative second-order
correlation (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn–Sham (GGA)
orbitals and eigenvalues, was used for geometry optimization. The
def2TZVP basis set was used on Ti, Cl, and Br; the def2SVP basis was
used on all other atoms.87 An ultrafine
grid was used for all calculations (Gaussian keyword: int = ultrafine).
