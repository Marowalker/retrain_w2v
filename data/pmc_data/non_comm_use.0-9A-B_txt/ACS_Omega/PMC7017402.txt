Mine fires are one of the primary
natural disasters in coal production.
The majority of mine fires are caused by the spontaneous combustion
of coal. To reduce the risk of spontaneous combustion of coal, a new
fire prevention and extinguishing hydrogel has been developed. Poly(acrylic
acid-co-methacrylamide) (P(AA-co-MAA)) and chitosan-grafted poly(acrylic acid-co-methacrylamide) (CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA)) were prepared by aqueous solution polymerization, and their
characteristics have been studied by scanning electron microscopy
and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The swelling ability
and water retention of the hydrogels were also tested and compared.
The experimental results showed that the grafting of chitosan can
improve the water-absorbing ability of the hydrogel in acidic solution
and deionized water and enhance the water retention of the hydrogel.
The thermogravimetric experiments of the mixture of the hydrogel and
coal showed that the thermal stability of the mixture was the best
when the ratio of hydrogel to coal was 1:10, and the grafting of chitosan
did not weaken the thermal stability of the hydrogel. In addition,
the thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry measurement
of coal with the hydrogel in air proved that the CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel effectively prevented the
initial oxidation of coal. Thus, CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) is recommended as an inhibitor in preventing coal
oxidation.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Mine fires are one of
the main natural disasters in coal mining.1 Their occurrence will not only damage coal resources
and equipment but also produce large volumes of smoke and toxic gases.
Numerous mine fire accidents occur in China every year, resulting
in significant economic losses and human casualties. The spontaneous
combustion of coal is the main cause of mine fires. When coal comes
into contact with sufficient oxygen, oxidation will be initiated and
continuous oxidation leads to head accumulation.2 In order to prevent spontaneous combustion of coal, inhibitors
such as inorganic salts (CaCl2, MgCl2),3−5 free radical scavengers (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, procyanidine),6 and ionic liquids7−9 are used. These inhibitors
played a positive role in preventing coal oxidation by altering the
physical properties of the coal or eliminating free radicals existing
in the coal oxidation process. However, physical inhibitors are easily
run off with temperature increase, and free radical scavengers are
mostly expensive; moreover, it is also hard to ensure that they react
completely with the active free radical in the coal piles. Furthermore,
some inorganic gels including water glass10 and composite slurry11 have been used
in coal mines. These techniques are relatively simple and low-cost,
but there are also some problems with these materials. The inorganic
gel is easy to crack in the water loss phase and has a fast water
loss rate. Particularly for the ammonium salt gel, it can release
toxic gas when used. The strength of composite slurry is not high.12 Some chemical slurry expands rapidly, which
leads to blockages in pipelines during grouting.13

In order to resolve these problems, it is necessary
to find new
materials to replace the existing mine fire prevention and extinguishing
materials. Hydrogels, as high-molecular-weight polymers, have characteristics
capable of absorbing a large amount of water and retaining moisture.
It is already widely applied to aspects of sanitary products, agriculture,
medicine, and other applications.14−16

Moreover, due
to their characteristics, hydrogels are also proposed
for use in fire prevention and extinguishing.17,18 For example, Tsai et al.19 prepared a
thermosensitive hydrogel (P(NIPA-co-SA)). This gel
is liquid at low temperatures and converts to solid at high temperatures.
The experimental results show that the gel has a good inhibitory effect
on anthracite. Hu et al.20 synthesized
authigenic gas-foaming hydrogels by using chitosan (CS), acrylic acid
(AA), and attapulgite (APT) and studied the effect of different synthetic
conditions on the properties of the hydrogel. Huang et al.21grafted tea polyphenol radicals onto a hydrogel
and then mixed the hydrogel with halloysite nanotubes (HNTs). Through
the results of experiments, this composite hydrogel was found to inhibit
the spontaneous combustion and oxidation of coal. However, the previous
research studies focused on the inhibitory properties of a gel on
coal oxidation at low temperatures. In contrast, the heat stability
of the coal treated with a hydrogel at high temperatures was rarely
researched. In addition, expensive cost, poor adaptability of hydrogels
in acid and alkali solutions, and nondegradability of hydrogels also
limit their application in mines.

Acrylic acid (AA) is a common
monomer used to synthesize hydrogels.
The hydroxyl groups in acrylic acid can form hydrogen bonds when exposed
to water, causing them to have strong hydrophilicity. Methylacrylamide
(MAA) is known as a biocompatible compound.19,20 Some studies have shown that methacrylamide can enhance the water
absorption capacity of hydrogels. The polymers synthesized by these
two monomers are degradable and thus do not pollute underground environments.21 Therefore, these two monomers were selected
to prepare the hydrogel in this work. Graft refers to the reaction
of a macromolecular chain with an appropriate branched or functional
side group via a chemical bond. By means of polymerization, two kinds
of polymers with different properties can be grafted together to form
grafting materials with special properties.22 Chitosan is a natural polymer product obtained by deacetylation
of chitin and widely exists in nature.23 It has been commonly used in medicine, food, and chemical industries
due to its excellent properties such as low cost, microbial degradability,
compatibility, and nontoxicity.23−−29 Thus, in order to improve the adaptability of hydrogel in a solution
with different pH values and make the hydrogel degradable, chitosan
grafted onto P(AA-co-MAA) was synthesized and characterized
in this paper. The thermal stability and the inhibitory performance
of chitosan-grafted P(AA-co-MAA) were investigated
by simultaneous thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry
(TG–DSC) measurement.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy of
Samples
The FTIR spectra of P(AA-co-MAA)
and CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogels
are shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1b, a
wide absorption band can be observed from 3500 to 3000 cm–1, which represents hydroxyl groups of acrylic acid and N–H
groups of methacrylamide. The peak at 2946 cm–1 represents
methylene groups, and the peak at 1715 cm–1 is due
to C=O groups of acrylic acid.26 The peak at 1563 cm–1 represents −COOH
groups. There are two obvious absorption peaks at 1450 and 1408 cm–1, which represent −COO– groups.
In Figure 1a, the position
of each absorption peak is similar to that in Figure 1b, which represents a similar molecular structure
for both gels. The peak at 1169 cm–1 represents
the ether bond in chitosan, suggesting that the CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel had been prepared.

P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogels.

2.2 Effect of pH Value on Equilibrium Water Absorbency
Equilibrium water absorbency represents the water absorption of
hydrogels when the hydrogel is saturated. Due to the complexity of
underground environments, the prepared hydrogel needs to work under
both acidic and alkaline conditions. The different pH values of the
solution will lead to the expansion ratio of the hydrogel being different,
which will affect the leakage blocking and cooling properties of the
hydrogel. Therefore, it is necessary to test the water absorption
and swelling properties of the hydrogel in different buffer solutions.

The equilibrium water absorbency of P(AA-co-MAA)
and CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogels
in different buffer solutions with different pH values is shown in Figure 2. The water absorbency
of both hydrogels clearly decreased when the solution was acidic or
alkaline. This was because when the pH value of the solution was low,
most of the ionizable groups were not dissociated and there was no
electrostatic repulsive force in the system. The hydrogel shrinks,
and the moisture cannot enter the interior by osmotic pressure. With
the pH value increasing to neutral, the dissociable groups are rapidly
dissociated, the electrostatic repulsive force between ions makes
the molecular chain expansion gel network larger, and the degree of
swelling begins to increase. When the pH value continues to rise to
alkaline conditions, the ionizable groups have been completely dissociated
and the concentration of external ions is basically the same as internal
ions. The decrease in osmotic pressure leads to the decreased swelling
properties of the hydrogel. In Figure 2, it is evident that the CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel has improved swelling properties in acidic
and neutral solutions as compared with the P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel. This may be caused by the fact that the chitosan
contains a large number of hydrophilic groups such as amino (−NH2) and hydroxyl (−OH). Amino groups produce electronic
repulsive forces on the hydrogel network, which enhance the swelling
performance of the hydrogel. It is known that stronger water absorption
can make the hydrogel adapt to more complex environments and improve
the endothermic ability; thus, the CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel has stronger adaptability to its surroundings
than the P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel.

of P(AA-co-MAA) and
CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogels in
different buffer solutions with different pH values.

2.3 Water Retention of P(AA-co-MAA) and CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) Hydrogels
Water retention determines whether the hydrogels can absorb heat
for a long time through the evaporation of water. Figure 3 shows the water retention
properties of P(AA-co-MAA) and CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) at high temperatures. The water loss
rate for P(AA-co-MAA) is relatively fast. A 4 h period
was required for the weight of the hydrogel to no longer change. It
is clear that the grafting of chitosan prolonged this process. The
water in CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) was
completely lost after a 5 h period. It can be concluded from this
study that the CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA)
had a good water retention capacity even at a high temperature. This
ability will help the hydrogel reduce water loss and prolong the endothermic
time in practical applications.

Figure 3 Water retention of P(AA-co-MAA) and CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA).

2.4 Surface Structure of Samples
The
scanning electron microscopy diagrams of the two hydrogels are shown
in Figure 4. The surface
structures of the two gels are very different. Compared with P(AA-co-MAA), the surface of the CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel in Figure 4b has more complex grains and folds. It can be inferred
from the results of the water absorption test that this structure
expands the surface area of the hydrogel and makes it easier for moisture
to spread into the hydrogel, which strengthens the swelling properties
of the hydrogel. The reason for this phenomenon may be that acrylic
acid is an anionic monomer and chitosan is a cationic polymer. The
molecular repulsive force in the graft product is small, which leads
to the curling of the molecular chain. Better water absorption enables
the hydrogel to absorb more heat by the evaporation of water.

2.5 Results
from the Thermal Stability Analysis
of Samples
The thermal stability of chitosan is poor, so
it is necessary to study the effect of grafting on the thermal stability
of the copolymer. Considering the practical application in mines,
TG and differential thermogravimetry (DTG) were used to determine
the thermal stability of the hydrogels. The TGA data obtained from
the measurements for CJS coal samples containing different weight
percentages of P(AA-co-MAA) and CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) under nitrogen are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. As observed from the figures, the TG curves
experience a slight decline at the initial stage from room temperature
to approximately 100 °C, which is attributed to the loss of bound
moisture at this stage. As the temperature is increased further, the
mass of samples remaining decreases slowly until approximately 350
°C, which is then followed by a rapid decrease. For raw CJS coal,
it is evident that there is a mass loss peak at ∼450 °C,
implying the thermal decomposition of coal. While for CJS coal samples
containing hydrogels, apart from the mass loss peak at 450 °C,
another mass loss peak appeared at approximately 350 °C, which
can be ascribed to the destruction of the cross-linked structure and
the loss of hydroxide and amine groups. As the hydrogel used increased,
the mass loss rate increased; and when 10 wt % CTS-grafted hydrogel
was mixed with the coal, the DTG curve showed a lower mass loss peak
at 350 °C than P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel-mixed coal,
and heat stability of the sample was close to that of the original
coal sample.

Figure 5 (a) Thermogravimetric curves and (b) DTG data of the mixture
of
coal and the P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel.

Figure 6 (a) Thermogravimetric curves and (b) DTG data of the mixture of
coal and the CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA)
hydrogel.

This indicates that the thermal
stability of the sample containing
10% CTS-grafted hydrogel is better than that of the sample with more
hydrogel content. Thus, 10 wt % CTS-grafted hydrogel could be chosen
as optimal.

2.6 Inhibition of Coal Oxidation
at an Early Stage
by CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA)
In
order to test the effect of the CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel on coal–oxygen complex action, the
thermal analysis experiment was carried out in air. Considering the
thermal stability of the mixture, the ratio of coal to gel was chosen
according to the results of the previous thermal analysis experiments.
The CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel
was mixed with CJS coal at a weight ratio of 1:10, and the mixture
was analyzed by thermal analysis in air. The results of the thermal
analysis are shown in Figure 7. For raw CJS coal, a slight decline appeared at the initial
stage due to dehydration. As the temperature increased further, the
mass of raw CJS coal started to increase and reached a maximum at
315 °C. The reason for this phenomenon is that there was chemical
adsorption between coal and oxygen in air. Followed by the increase,
the coal mass started to drop rapidly. During this stage, the oxidation
speed of the coal was accelerated, and as the temperature continued
to rise, the coal reached the burning point. Different to raw coal
samples, there was no obvious mass increase followed by dehydration
for the CJS coal containing 10 wt % CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA), and a plateau was found at temperatures between
130 and 340 °C. That indicated that the coal oxidation was inhibited
by the 10 wt % CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA)
hydrogel.

Figure 7 Thermal analysis of coal and the mixture of coal and the CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel in air.

Figure 8 displays
the DSC curves for raw CJS and 10 wt % CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel-mixed CJS coal samples in air. For raw
CJS coal, a small exothermic peak appeared at temperatures between
283 and 409 °C followed by a significant exothermic peak. However,
the DSC curve for the 10 wt % CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel mixed with the CJS coal sample showed an
apparent difference compared to raw CJS. There was only a significant
exothermic peak observed at temperatures from 366 to 635 °C,
indicating that the oxidation of CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel-treated CJS coal was slower than that of
raw coal. This was because the oxygen was isolated from the surface
of the coal sample by hydrogel layers, thus reducing diffusion rates
of oxygen and inhibiting the combustion. The above phenomena indicated
that coal oxidation could be potentially prevented by the CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel in low-temperature
environments.

Figure 8 DSC curves of coal and the mixture of coal and hydrogel.

2.7 In Situ FTIR Analysis of
Coal Oxidation
The infrared spectra of raw CJS and 10 wt
% CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel-mixed
CJS coal samples in
air at different temperatures are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 FTIR spectra of coals in air at different temperatures.

From the data collected from in situ FTIR, we found
that the peaks
ranging from 3200 to 3600 cm–1 (specific to hydroxyl
group) and 2800 to 3000 cm–1 (specific to CH2 and CH3) of raw and 10 wt % CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA)-treated CJS decreased with the increased
temperature, and those for raw CJS decreased faster than CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA)-treated coal, indicating
that although hydroxyl and fatty acid groups participated in oxidation,
CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) could slow the
oxidation.

3 Conclusions
This
study investigated P(AA-co-MAA) and CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogels, prepared by solution
polymerization, and found a contrast between them. The results of
swelling experiments and water retention tests indicated that the
grafting of chitosan enhanced the absorbing ability of the hydrogels
in buffer solutions with different pH values (5.8, 7.0, and 8.1) and
prolonged the water retention time of the hydrogels. The thermal decomposition
temperature of the two hydrogels was about 350 °C, much higher
than the environmental temperature used to prevent and control spontaneous
combustion of coal. The thermogravimetric experiment in nitrogen showed
that the CJS coal containing 10 wt % CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) has the best thermal stability. The thermogravimetric
and DSC curves revealed that the CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogel can prevent the initial oxidation of coal.
The in situ FTIR spectra of coal oxidation indicated that CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) could slow down the oxidation
of hydroxyl and fatty acid groups. Thus, the results of this work
show that CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) is
a good mine fire-resistant material and can be of useful application
in the inhibition of coal oxidation.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
The majority of reagents
used (including acrylic acid (AA, A.R. grade), methacrylamide (MAA,
A.R. grade), chitosan (CTS), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine
(TEMED, A.R. grade), ammonium persulfate (APS, A.R. grade), N,N′-methylene diacrylamide (MBA,
A.R. grade), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, A.R. grade)) were purchased
from a local medical station.

The coal samples were collected
from the Chenjiashan (CJS) Colliery in Shaanxi province. In sample
preparation, lumps of coal were milled and sieved with fragments in
the 0.25–0.80 mm range then dried at 110 °C under nitrogen
to a constant mass and placed in sealed containers in preparation
for the experimental investigations. Table 1 summarizes the basic characteristics of
the coal.

4.2 Preparation of P(AA-co-MAA)
and CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA)
Initially, 1.28 g of sodium hydroxide was dissolved in deionized
(DI) water to prepare the sodium hydroxide solution, and 5.76 g of
acrylic acid (AA) was slowly added to the solution. In order to prevent
the self-polymerization of acrylic acid, the process was carried out
in an ice water bath. Subsequently, the partially neutralized acrylic
acid solution was transferred to a three-neck flask, oxygen was removed,
and 0.228 g of APS was added to initiate the free radical. After 10
min, 1.70 g of MAA, 0.154 g of MBA, and 0.228 g of TEMED were added
to the three-neck flask. The temperature was kept at 70 °C for
1 h to complete the polymerization reaction. The product was then
washed with water to remove monomers that were not involved in the
reaction. Finally, the product was dried at 90 °C for 12 h, crushed,
and sieved through a 40-mesh screen.

The preparation method
of CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) was similar
to that of P(AA-co-MAA). CTS (0.1 g) was dissolved
in 60 mL of 1 wt % glacial acetic acid. At the same time, 1.28 g of
sodium hydroxide was dissolved in water to prepare the sodium hydroxide
solution, and 5.76 g of acrylic acid was slowly added to the solution.
In order to prevent the self-polymerization of acrylic acid, the process
was carried out in an ice water bath. The CTS solution and the partially
neutralized acrylic acid solution were then transferred to a three-neck
flask with oxygen removed, and 0.228 g of APS was added to produce
the free radical. The following steps were used as per the preparation
of P(AA-co-MAA). Again, the product was dried at
90 °C for 12 h, crushed, and passed through the 40-mesh screen.

4.3 Characterization
The P(AA-co-MAA) and CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) hydrogels
prepared were characterized by recording FTIR spectra
on a Nicolet 6700 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Company, USA). The samples were dried prior to measurement.
The surfaces of the samples were sprayed with gold, and the morphology
of the samples were observed under a Quanta 250 scanning electron
microscope (FEI Company, USA).

4.4 Swelling
Experiment
Samples (0.5
g) were immersed in 100 mL of DI water for 12 h to ensure that the
hydrogel fully absorbs water. The excess moisture was then filtered
using an 80-mesh screen, and the hydrogel was set aside for 15 min.
Subsequent to that, the swollen sample was weighed. The equilibrium
water absorbency of the swollen sample was calculated using the following
equation (eq 1) 1  

where ws and wd are the
weights of
the swollen sample and dry sample, respectively. Qeq was calculated on the grams of water per gram of sample
basis.

The effect of pH value on adsorption was also measured
at the same
time. Two 100 mL buffer solutions with pH values of 5.3 and 8.1 were
prepared by the following steps: Solution 1 was prepared through weighing
7.099 g of Na2HPO4 and adding distilled water
to 1000 mL. Solution 2 was prepared by weighing 6.803 g of KH2PO4 and adding distilled water to 1000 mL. Five
milliliters of solution 1 and 95 mL of solution 2 were used to configure
the acid buffer solution and the test results for a pH value of 5.3.
Ninety-five milliliters of solution 1 and 5 mL of solution 2 were
used to configure the alkaline buffer solution and the test results
for a pH value of 8.1. Deionized water was selected as the neutral
solution. The 0.5 g hydrogel samples were immersed in the two buffer
solutions and set aside for 12 h. The excess moisture was then filtered
using an 80-mesh screen, and the samples were set aside for 15 min.
Subsequently, the samples were weighed, and the equilibrium water
absorbency was calculated.

4.5 Water Retention of the
Hydrogel
The
hydrogel samples were immersed in ample DI water for 12 h to ensure
that the hydrogel fully absorbs water. The saturated water-absorbing
hydrogel samples were weighed and then dried at 90 °C until the
mass no longer changed. The weight of the sample was recorded every
hour. Water retention of the hydrogel was indicated using the following
equation (eq 2) 2  

where wt and wi represent the weight
of the hydrogel subjected to the drying process and the weight of
the initial hydrogel, respectively. R represents
the water retention rate.

4.6 Thermogravimetric Analysis
Two hydrogel
samples (P(AA-co-MAA) and CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA)) were mixed separately with CJS coal in different
mass ratios (1:10, 1.5:10, and 2:10). Deionized water was added to
the mixture, and the mixture was stirred to make the sample homogeneous.
The mixture was then dried at 90 °C for 12 h. Ten milligrams
of the mixture was weighed as a sample for thermal analysis. Thermogravimetric
analysis was performed using a Q-600 synchronous thermal analyzer
(TA Company, USA) at a heating rate of 15 °C/min from 20 to 800
°C. Two groups of experiments were carried out, one with nitrogen
and the other in dried air. The gas flow in the experiments was 100
mL/min.

4.7 In Situ FTIR
In situ FTIR was employed
to determine changes in functional groups in the coal samples with
a KBr powder background used as a reference. CTS-g-P(AA-co-MAA) was mixed with CJS coal in the mass
ratio of 1:10, and the raw and mixed samples were dried at 40 °C
in a vaccum oven overnight under N2. In situ infrared spectrometer
was used to perform the test. Dry air flowed into the reaction chamber
from its base and exited out to the top. A temperature controller
was connected to the reaction chamber, and the chamber was heated
to 140 °C. The scanning range was 4000–400 cm–1 while the resolution was 4 cm–1, and 64 scans
were summed to produce each spectrum.
