Two
stacking manners, that is, π- and lamellar stacking,
are generally found for organic semiconductors, in which the π-stacking
occurs between conjugated groups and the lamellar stacking refers
to the separation of the conjugated and aliphatic moieties. The stacking
principles are yet not well-defined. In this work, extended transition
state–natural orbitals for chemical valence (ETS–NOCV),
an energy decomposition analysis, is utilized to examine the π-
and lamellar stacking for a series of naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide
(R-NDI) crystals. The crucial role of dispersion is validated. The
perception that π-stacking is merely determined by the conjugated
moiety is challenged. The stacking principles are associated with
the closest packing model. Nanoscopic phase separation of conjugated
and aliphatic moieties and the formation of lamellar and herringbone
motifs in the R-NDIs can thus be clarified. Moreover, the interactions
between NDI and the alkyl chain are investigated, revealing that the
interactions can be significant, being contradictory to the conventional
point of view. Along with R-NDIs, additional organic crystals consisting
of various conjugated functionalities and substituents are also investigated
by ETS–NOCV. The sampling scope is up to 108 conjugated molecules.
The dominant role of dispersion force irrespective of the variation
in the conjugated moieties and substituents is further confirmed.
It is envisaged that the established principles are applicable to
other organic semiconductors. The perspective toward the π-
and lamellar stacking might be modified, paving the way for ultimate
morphological control.

Introduction
Organic semiconductors
have been used extensively in organic photovoltaics,1,2 organic field-effect transistors,3−5 organic light-emitting
diodes,6−8 organic biomedical devices,9,10 and
so on. The device performance is associated with numerous factors,
such as chemical functionality,11 chemical
structure,12,13 molecular weight,14−16 morphology,17 and device architecture.18,19 Among all, the effect of morphology is often prominent. The morphology
can be quantified by the parameter of order. One extreme is amorphous,
and the other is crystalline. It is common for organic semiconductors
to have both amorphous and crystalline regions, especially in solution-processed
organic thin films. Two stacking manners, that is, π- and lamellar
stacking, are generally found for the order domains, in which the
π-stacking occurs between conjugated groups and the lamellar
stacking usually refers to the regular separation of the conjugated
and aliphatic moieties (Scheme 1).20 Moreover, two packing motifs
lamella (Scheme 1a)
and herringbone (Scheme 1b) are typically utilized to describe the relationship between the
individual π-channels along the direction of the lamellar stacking.
To avoid confusion, it has to be noted that the lamellar motif is
used to represent the pattern, being different from the lamellar stacking
(Scheme 1).

and (b) Herringbone Motif
Other lamellar motifs
exist.

Electrostatic interaction and direct
interaction have been proposed
to account for the formation of π-stacking. In the former, the
electron density of conjugated systems is modulated by the attaching
substituent, thus giving rise to the variation in the electrostatic
interactions between conjugated systems.21−25 The latter stresses that direct interactions exist
between the substituent and the conjugated system along with the interactions
induced from the change in bond polarity because of the presence of
the substituent.26−30 It has been examined experimentally and theoretically that the direct
interaction model is usually dominant for the π-stacking.31,32 The direct interaction could be associated with the enhanced London
dispersion force.32−41 On the other hand, the occurrence of lamellar stacking is often
rationalized by the compatibility principle, that is, like dissolves
like. On account of the polarity difference between the conjugated
and aliphatic moieties, the separation takes place accordingly. It
is instinctive to relate the polarity effect with the electrostatic
interaction.

Combination of the extended transition-state (ETS)
method42−44 and the natural orbitals for chemical valence (NOCV)
theory,45−47 coined as ETS–NOCV, has been employed to decompose
the interaction
energy (ΔEint) between two molecular
entities into three chemically meaningful components—electrostatic
interactions (Vele), Pauli repulsion (EPauli), and orbital interactions (Eoi). Vele is the conventional
electrostatic interaction between two molecules. EPauli is the repulsive Pauli interaction between the occupied
orbitals of two different molecules. Eoi stands for the stabilizing interactions between the occupied molecular
orbitals in one molecule and the unoccupied molecular orbitals in
the other molecule along with the interaction of occupied and virtual
orbitals within the same molecule in the final geometry. Because traditional
density functionals often fail in describing the dispersion force
accurately, an additional dispersion correction (Edis) can be included in the above energy decomposition
scheme with the aim of taking long-range interactions into consideration.48−56 Herein, numerous N,N′-dialkyl-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic
diimides (R-NDIs) are chosen for the study, such as R = C14H29,57 C12H25,58 C6H13,59 C5H11,60 C4H9,58 C2H5,61 and 1-CH3C6H1258 (Scheme 2). The π- and lamellar stacking extracted from selected single-crystal
structures are examined by ETS–NOCV. The interactions between
NDI and the alkyl chain are also investigated computationally. The
stacking principles on π- and lamellar stacking for R-NDIs are
thus established. Moreover, in conjunction with R-NDIs, additional
organic crystals containing a variety of conjugated functionalities
and substituents are examined as well. The total sampling scope is
up to 108 conjugated molecules. It is envisioned that the principles
should apply to other organic semiconductors, paving the way for ultimate
morphological control.

Scheme 2 Chemical Structure of R-NDI
Results and Discussion
π-Stacking
It can be concluded from all the examined
crystal structures that in the π-stacking, each R-NDI molecule
is basically enclosed by 6 equiv. C14H29-NDI
is taken for illustration (Figure 1). Symmetry operation reveals that the basic alignments
between the central C14H29-NDI and the surroundings
can be classified into three types and the corresponding intermolecular
interactions between two molecules are labeled as Ta, Tp, and Tq (Figure 1a). Figure 1b demonstrates
the distinct separation of the conjugated and aliphatic moieties in
the π-stacking from another viewpoint. Originally, the BP86/TZP
level of theory was used to estimate Ta, Tp, and Tq. However, in the absence of Edis, the
interactions are commonly repulsive, being contrary to the formation
of these single crystals. BP86-BJDAMP/TZP with the inclusion of Grimme’s
BJDAMP dispersion correction was applied instead.50 ETS–NOCV results of π-stacking in C14H29-NDI are summarized in Table 1. In the parenthesis following Tx (x = a, p, or q), NDI denotes that the aliphatic chains
are replaced by four hydrogens and R denotes that the NDI groups are
substituted by four hydrogens. Tx(NDI)
and Tx(R) are utilized to give rough estimation
about the individual contribution of conjugated and aliphatic moieties
to the ΔEint. Several conclusions
can be drawn from Table 1: (1) Edis > Vele > Eoi is found for most
decompositions,
(2) Edis is the principal stabilization
for either Ta, Tp, or Tq, (3) Ta has the strongest stabilization (−37.00 kcal
mol–1, entry 1, Table 1), followed by Tp (−28.97 kcal mol–1, entry 4, Table 1) and Tq (−7.79 kcal mol–1, entry 7, Table 1), (4) comparison
of Tx(NDI) and Tx(R) reveals that the contribution of the tetradecanyl group
to the ΔEint is comparable to that
of the NDI functionality, and (5) sum of Tx(NDI) and Tx(R) is all less than Tx, suggesting that the mutual interactions between
the tetradecanyl and NDI moieties are not trivial. It is envisaged
that the packing mode should be decided by intermolecular interactions.
In the case of C14H29-NDI, the dispersion force
is the dominant contribution. In theory, dispersion is treated as
atom-pairwise empirical function. In other words, the dispersion should
be highly related to the molecular contact. The increase in the molecular
contact should encourage the dispersion force. It is thus rational
to see Ta > Tp > Tq because the molecular
contact decreases
from Ta to Tp and Tq. Moreover, given that Edis is the principal stabilization rather than Vele, the relatively apolar tetradecanyl group
can then result in greater stabilization than the NDI unit (see entries
5–6, Table 1), challenging the common belief that the π-stacking is merely
determined by the conjugated moiety.

1-CH3C6H12-NDI are listed in the Supporting Information (Tables S1–S6) and
summarized in Table 2. The principal character of dispersion to the ΔEint is generally observed. On the whole, Ta, Tp, and Tq decrease gradually in magnitude from the tetradecanyl
group to the ethyl group (Table 2). Tables S1–S6 also
reveal that the proportion of Tx(R) to
the ΔEint is diminished as the chain
gets shorter. Both observations can be justified by the reduction
in the molecular contact as the shortening of side chain.

Structurally speaking, R-NDI
consists of two primary units, that
is, the R and NDI groups (Scheme 2). The R group has a linear and flexible molecular
shape. The NDI group has yet a rectangular and rigid configuration.
For a given space with a finite number of R-NDI molecules, the molecules
would arrange themselves to gain maximal intermolecular interactions,
of which the dispersion is the most dominant. As mentioned previously,
the dispersion is linked with the molecular contact. It is thus envisioned
that the dispersion stabilization of the whole system can be maximized
by the closest packing. For R-NDIs, as a result of their disparity
in the molecular shape, the R and NDI groups would undergo nanoscopic
phase separation to accomplish the closest packing (Figure 1b). Along this line, the formation
of π-stacking might stem essentially from the similarity in
the shape rather than the polarity. It can be regarded as the consequence
deriving from the governing role of dispersion over electrostatic
interaction. However, it is recognized that molecular steric hindrance
is associated with EPauli, which would
prevent two molecules from establishing too compact stacking. For
instance, in Table 3, two C14H29-NDI molecules are forced to align
face-to-face and the resultant ΔEints are all repulsive irrespective of the variation in the intermolecular
distance from 3.4 to 4.2 Å, being attributed to the drastically
large value of EPauli. Moreover, as judged
by the degree of stabilization, Vele and Eoi should still be able to regulate the molecular
position in the π-stacking to a certain extent. Nonetheless,
their dominance is just much inferior to Edis.

Lamellar Stacking
Single-crystal
structures confirm
that C14H29-NDI, C12H25-NDI, C6H13-NDI, C4H9-NDI, and 1-CH3C6H12-NDI fall into
the category of the lamellar motif (Scheme 1a), whereas C5H11-NDI
and C2H5-NDI exhibit the herringbone motif (Scheme 1b). With the aim
of investigating the intermolecular interactions in the lamellar stacking,
we intentionally set a nonhydrogen intermolecular distance of 4 Å
as a criterion. For a R-NDI molecule in one π-stacking channel,
only the R-NDI molecule in the adjacent π-stacking locating
close to or within 4 Å is considered to likely give rise to noticeable
intermolecular interactions. On the basis of this definition, in the
lamellar stacking, there are two corresponding interacting modes for
C14H29-NDI, C12H25-NDI,
and C6H13-NDI, three modes for C4H9-NDI and 1-CH3C6H12-NDI, and four modes for C5H11-NDI and C2H5-NDI (Figure S1).
For illustration, the ETS–NOCV results of C14H29-NDI are listed in Table 4. Edis is still the major
stabilization in the ΔEint. Nevertheless,
modes a and b both exhibit much weaker stabilization than Ta, Tp, or Tq in the π-stacking (Table 1). Similar results are also
observed for C12H25-NDI, C6H13-NDI, C5H11-NDI, C4H9-NDI, C2H5-NDI, and 1-CH3C6H12-NDI (Tables S7–S12). Overall, most of the interactions in the lamellar stacking are
below −3.00 kcal mol–1 in magnitude, revealing
that the contributions of the lamellar stacking to the total stabilization
are much smaller than those resulting from the π-stacking. In
order to achieve maximal stabilization, one would expect that to reduce
the length of lamellar stacking and leave more space for the π-stacking
is a rational approach, which would lead to the herringbone motif.
C5H11-NDI and C2H5-NDI
belong to this group. Figure 2 clearly shows that in the crystal structure of C5H11-NDI, the pentanyl group deviates from the stable zigzag
configuration to reduce the dimension of lamellar stacking, leading
to the formation of a herringbone motif. In contrast, the long or
bulky alkyl chains, such as C14H29, C12H25, C6H13, and 1-CH3C6H12, would preclude R-NDI molecules from
the herringbone motif and the lamellar motif would be realized instead.
Nevertheless, C4H9-NDI seems to be an exception.
Given that the butyl group is shorter than the pentanyl one, C4H9-NDI is expected to adopt a herringbone motif,
which is yet not the experimental observation. In Table S10, the interactions of C4H9-NDI
in the lamellar stacking can be up to −7.70 kcal mol–1 in magnitude, which is significantly higher than the others. Figure 3 clearly shows the
intercalation of the butyl chains in the lamellar stacking for C4H9-NDI, which not only contracts the lamellar-stacking
dimension but also enhances the dispersion stabilization, accounting
for the construction of a lamellar motif for C4H9-NDI.

Interactions between NDI and the Alkyl Chain
The π-stacking
and lamellar stacking are investigated individually hitherto. It is
intriguing to further look into the interactions between NDI and the
alkyl chain. Nevertheless, the corresponding crystal structures are
not experimentally accessible. Theoretical approaches are employed
instead. Geometry optimizations were performed between the NDI molecule
and various alkanes at the BP86-BJDAMP/TZP level of theory. The minimum
nature of each optimized geometry was confirmed by frequency calculation.
The computational results reveal that the NDI molecule is able to
form stable adducts with different alkanes and Edis still plays the most important role (Table 5). The results strongly suggest that the
interactions between NDI and the alkyl chain can be substantial, especially
for the extensive alkyl chain, which again challenges the conventional
point of view that a conjugated moiety interacts barely with an aliphatic
chain. As expected, the ΔEint increases
from ethane (entry 1, Table 5) to all C6H14 isomers (entries 2–6, Table 5) and tetradecane
(entry 7, Table 5)
because of the increase in the molecular contact. Comparison of all
C6H14 isomers (entries 2–6, Table 5) indicates that the
ΔEint is sensitive to the molecular
shape. Branched structures could lead to greater stabilization. Overall,
these results provide justification for the use of long and branch
side chains to increase the solubility for conjugated molecules and
polymers by hindering the π-stacking.62−64 For comparison,
the NDI–NDI adduct is optimized, and its ΔEint is calculated to be −24.52 kcal mol–1 (entry 8, Table 5), which is much higher in magnitude than the others (entries 1–7, Table 5). It is envisaged
that in order to maximize the intermolecular interactions, the NDI
molecule would prefer stacking with itself rather than the aliphatic
group, being consistent with the examined single-crystal structures
and our closest packing model. However, the disturbance in the π-stacking
would be enhanced gradually as the increase of linear or branch hydrocarbon
in the alkyl chain.

General Applicability
With the intention
of examining
the general applicability of the closest packing model derived from
the governing character of dispersion, additional 101 organic crystals
comprising various conjugated functionalities and substituents are
investigated by ETS–NOCV as well. Molecular pairs extracted
from the crystal structures were calculated, and the ΔEints are summarized in Table S13. Along with the seven molecules listed in Table 2, the sampling scope is up to
108. The results reveal that in nearly all the cases, the contribution
of dispersion in the ΔEint is larger
than 60%, validating that the dominant role of dispersion force is
independent of the variation in the conjugated moieties and substituents.
It can thus be envisaged that the derived principles in this work
should have broad applicability.

Conclusions
ETS–NOCV
has been performed to study the π- and lamellar
stacking for a series of R-NDI crystals. The energy decomposition
results indicate that the dispersion is the most important stabilization
in the intermolecular interactions. The increase in the molecular
contact should in principle strengthen the dispersion. The closest
packing model for elucidating the stacking principles for R-NDIs is
thus developed. It is rational to see that the R and NDI groups undergo
nanoscopic phase separation in the π-stacking. Furthermore,
the contribution of R to the formation of π-stacking can be
significant, challenging the common belief that the π-stacking
is predominantly determined by the conjugated moiety. As for the lamellar
stacking, the corresponding interactions are much smaller than those
resulting from the π-stacking. In order to achieve maximal stabilization,
to reduce the length of lamellar stacking and leave more space for
the π-stacking is a straightforward approach, which would lead
to the herringbone motif. In contrast, the long or bulky alkyl chains
would prohibit R-NDIs from the herringbone motif, and the lamellar
motif would be realized instead. It has to be emphasized that Pauli
repulsion would restrain two molecules from establishing too compact
stacking and the closest packing model has its limitation. Moreover,
the interactions between NDI and the alkyl chain are examined. The
NDI molecule is able to form stable adducts with different alkanes,
and the interactions between NDI and the alkyl chain can be substantial,
especially for the extensive alkyl chain. The results provide rationalization
for the use of long and branch side chains to increase the solubility
for conjugated molecules and polymers by hindering the π-stacking.
Along with R-NDIs, additional organic crystals comprising various
conjugated functionalities and substituents are also investigated
by ETS–NOCV. The sampling scope is up to 108 conjugated molecules.
The dominant role of dispersion force irrespective of the variation
in the conjugated moieties and substituents is further confirmed.
It is envisaged that the established principles are applicable to
other organic semiconductors. The traditional perspective toward the
π- and lamellar stacking might be modified, paving the way for
ultimate morphological control.
