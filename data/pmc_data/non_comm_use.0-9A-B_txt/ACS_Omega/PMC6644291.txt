4-Vinylphenyl-substituted
squaramides have been tested as organocatalysts
for the diastereo- and enantioselective synthesis of trisubstituted
benzopyrans via an oxa-Michael intramolecular nitro-Michael cascade
reaction. Both the enantio- and diastereoselection were good to moderate,
depending on the nature of the chiral scaffold in the catalyst. The
diastereoselection is better for the most active catalyst because
the final products epimerize at C-3 along the time. Supported squaramide
sq-9 prepared by copolymerization of sq-4 with styrene and divinylbenzene is also effective in promoting the
cascade reaction, and it is recoverable and reusable for five cycles
maintaining the activity.

==== Body
Introduction
Polysubstituted chromans
are common frameworks in natural and synthetic
molecules of biological and pharmaceutical interest,1−5 and the synthesis of chiral structures related with these compounds
has attracted a lot of work.6−14 One of the most efficient approaches to these structures consist
on the reaction of 2-substituted vinylphenol  derivatives with
α,β-unsaturated electrophiles. The cascade reaction starts
with a Michael reaction, followed by cyclization to the final product
in one step, and the organocatalyzed stereoselective version has recently
received a great attention. Among these approaches, spirochromanes
have been obtained by cascade reactions of ortho-hydroxynitrostyrenes12,15 or ortho-hydroxyphenyl para-quinone
methides16 with different electrophiles.
Benzopyrans with three contiguous stereocenters have been prepared
by the reaction of different nitroalkenes with ortho-hydroxy chalcones,17,18 salicylaldimines,19,20 and sequential intermolecular–intramolecular Michael addition
of nitromethane21 or thiols.22

The diastereoselective synthesis of dinitro-trisubstituted
benzopyrans
by cascade oxa-Michael–nitro-Michael reaction of ortho-hydroxynitrostyrene and nitroalkenes was described fifteen years
ago,23 but only very recently, the enantioselective
version of that process has been developed24 by using thioureas and squaramides as catalysts in homogeneous conditions.

Immobilization of molecular catalysts provides heterogeneous materials
that simplify the recovering from the reaction mixture, and recycling
for batch processes25−28 or used in flow systems.29−32 As a part of our interest in the search for novel
heterogeneous enantiopure bifunctional organocatalysts, we have recently
prepared polymeric materials by copolymerization of molecular thioureas
and squaramides, which are able to promote different stereoselective
cascade reactions.33 Now, we report on
the stereoselective synthesis of trisubstituted benzopyrans by sequential
oxa-Michael–nitro-Michael reactions catalyzed by these novel
organocatalysts.

Results and Discussion
Searching
for the best experimental conditions, we started the
study taking the reaction of ortho-hydroxynitrostyrene
with nitrostyrene as a model reaction in different solvents. Based
on our previous results, we used monomeric squaramides as catalysts
with a single stereocenter derived from l-tert-leucine (sq-4, sq-5) and l-valine
(sq-6, sq-7), which differ in substitution
at the basic nitrogen atom. For comparative purposes, squaramide (sq-8), derived from (1R,2R)-1,2-cyclohexane
diamine, and its homologous thiourea 8 were also tested
as catalysts.

In the proposed reactions, four possible diastereoisomers
could
be formed, but only two of them, which are epimers at C-3, were detected.
(2S,3S,4S)-trisubstituted
benzopyran 3aa was obtained as the major stereoisomer
and (2S,3R,4S)-epi-3aa as a minor one when the reaction was
catalyzed by squaramides (sq-4–sq-7), prepared from l-valine or l-tert-leucine. As expected, enantiomeric compounds (2R,3R,4R)-ent-3aa and (2R,3S,4R)-ent-epi-3aa were formed in the reactions catalyzed by thiourea 8 and squaramide sq-8 obtained from (1R,2R)-1,2-cyclohexane diamine but surprisingly, ent-epi-3aa was the major
diastereoisomer isolated in that case.

The preliminary experiments,
collected in Table 1, show that sq-4 and sq-6, with a dimethylamino
substituent, provided better results
in terms of yield and stereoselectivity than their piperidyl-substituted
homologs sq-5 and sq-7, respectively (compare
entries 1 and 3 vs 2 and 4 in Table 1). The catalyst loading can be diminished to 2 mol
% without affecting the stereoselection, although increasing the reaction
time (compare entries 1 and 5 in Table 1). Different solvents were also tested and good chemical
yields were obtained for all of them, but very bad stereoselection
was observed for ethereal tetrahydrofuran (THF) or alcoholic (MeOH)
solvents (compare entry 1 vs 6–9 in Table 1). This fact could be explained because
the protic media compete with the catalysts in forming hydrogen
bonds with the substrates. Squaramide sq-8 is a very
active catalyst leading to ent-epi-3aa and ent-3aa in good
yield after 8 h of reaction, but lower stereoselection than sq-4 and sq-6 (compare entry 11 vs 1 or 3 in Table 1), and its homologous
thiourea 8 yielded the same mixture of stereoisomers
but without diastereoselection and very low enantioselection (entry
10 in Table 1).

We first explored the influence
on the reactivity and stereoselection
of the electronic nature of the aryl group in the nitrostyrenes (2a–e) acting as acceptors (entries 3–14 in Table 2). As expected, nitroolefins
with electron-withdrawing groups (2b–c) are more
reactive than nitrostyrene or those incorporating an electron-donating
group (2d) leading to the final products in shorter reaction
time. In general, the reactions occurred with good to excellent stereoselectivity,
except for 2-naphthyl-derived nitroolefin 2e which led
to the addition–cyclization product 3ae in good
enantioselectivity but moderate diastereoselection (entries 12 and
13 in Table 2). It
is noteworthy that, contrary to that previously described,24 the reactions of nitrostyrenes with electron-withdrawing
groups occur with better diastereoselection than those with electron-donating
substituents (compare entries 3, 4, 6, 7 vs 10, 11). Additionally,
the data show that sq-4 was the best catalyst because
it provided higher yields and better stereoselection than sq-6 (compare entries 3, 6, 10, and 12 vs 4, 7, 11, and 13 in Table 2).

The reaction
was extended to 2-hydroxy nitrostyrenes with different
substituents at C-5 (2b–d) by using sq-4 as the catalyst (entries 15, 17–20, and 22–25 in Table 2). As a general trend,
the presence of a substituent at C-5 in the phenol nucleus decreased
the stereoselection, specially the diastereoselectivity, of the reaction
(compare entries 15, 20, and 25 in Table 2 with entry 1 in Table 1). This behavior is independent of the electronic
characteristic of the substituent (compare entries 17–19 or
22–24 vs 3, 6, 10, and 12, respectively, in Table 2).

Attempting to
improve the synthetic utility of the cascade
reaction, we treated to create quaternary stereocenters by reacting
trisubstituted nitroolefins 2f and 2g with 1a. trans α-methyl nitrostyrene 2f reacted very slowly with 1a by using sq-6 as the organocatalyst, leading to 3af in moderate
yield, very bad diastereoselection, and moderate enantioselectivity
(entry 27 in Table 2). On the contrary, trans-β-trifluoromethyl
nitrostyrene 2g was recovered unchanged after 144 h of
stirring with 1a in the presence of the same organocatalyst.
These facts are usually observed in Michael additions and could be
probably due to the steric demand on the disubstituted carbon of the
double bond. This kind of substitution slows down the intramolecular
nitro-Michael addition in intermediate B (Scheme 1) formed in the reaction of 2f, or the first intermolecular oxa-Michael addition in the
reaction of 2g.

Scheme 1 Plausible Ternary Complexes That Explain
the Formation of Stereoisomers
Because our main interest was the easy recovering and
recycling
of the catalyst, we studied the use of squaramide sq-933 that is the polymeric homolog of sq-4, as the catalyst (entries 1, 2, 5, 9, 14, 16, 21, and 26
in Table 2). These
results show that the polymeric material was able to promote the stereoselective
cascade process, but it was less effective than the monomeric substrate.
In general, the processes need longer reaction times, and the reaction
was less stereoselective.

The recyclability of polymeric squaramide
sq-9 was
tested in the reaction of ortho-hydroxynitrostyrene 1a with 4-fluoronitrostyrene 2b at room temperature
in DCM and 5 mol % of the catalyst. The mixture of the reaction was
stirred until disappearance of 1a thin-layer chromatography
(TLC), and the catalyst was isolated by filtration after each cycle,
and reused after washing and drying. The results summarized in Table 3 show that sq-9 can be used for five cycles maintaining the activity.

The relative stereochemistry for compound 3aa and
their epimers at C-3 (epi-3aa) were
established on the basis of the values of the coupling constants of
H-2, H-3, and H-3, H-4, as previously described for its 4-phenacyl-substituted
homolog.34 For 3aa, the values
of the coupling constants (3JH2,H3 = 2.5 Hz, 3JH3,H4 = 1.8 Hz)
indicate a cis relationship of the substituents at C-2 and C-3, and
trans geometry for the substituents at C-3 and C-4. Additionally,
absolute stereochemistry (2S,3S,4S) was established by X-ray diffraction analysis for compound 3ac (Figure 1)35 and generalized for all compounds 3aa–de. The values of the coupling constants for the
same protons (3JH2,H3 = 6.4
Hz, 3JH3,H4 = 4.9 Hz) also
allowed the assignation of the relative stereochemistry as trans for
C-2–C-3 and cis for C-3–C-4 substituents in diastereoisomer epi-3aa. In that case, the absolute configuration
(2S,3R,4S) for
these compounds was assigned by accepting that the stereodiscrimination
in the first oxa-Michael addition occurs in the same way for the formation
of both diastereoisomers.

The formation of enantiomers in the reactions promoted by
catalysts
derived from α-amino acids (sq-4–sq-7) and (1R,2R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine
(sq-8) is a consequence of the stereochemistry of the
ternary complex formed (Scheme 1), but we were intrigued by the fact that catalysts sq-4–7 and sq-8 provided diastereoisomers 3 and ent-epi-3 as major isomers, respectively. In order to clarify that observation,
we decided to study the evolution of the reaction of 1a with 2a catalyzed by sq-6 and sq-8 along the time, and the results are collected in Table 4.

d er correspond to ent-3aa and ent-epi-3aa, respectively.

e Data refer to the reaction of 2f with 1a.

The data collected in Table 4 show that both the
major and the ratio of diastereoisomers
are dependent on the reaction time. An additional important fact is
that epi-3aa (entry 1 in Table 4) or ent-epi-3aa (entry 6) was the first formed diastereoisomer,
and the ratio change along the time. For the reaction catalyzed by
sq-6, the ratio of 3aa increased over time
(entries 1–5 in Table 4) until the reaction finished after 24 h (entry 4). Both dr
and er were maintained along the time (entries 5, 6 in Table 4). On the contrary, catalyst
sq-8 is more active leading to ent-epi-3aa as a major isomer because the reaction
time is shorter (entry 8). Interestingly, when the reaction mixture
was stirred for longer periods of time, the epimerization of ent-epi-3aa into ent-3aa was observed, obtaining the latter as the major
diastereoisomer after 72 h (entries 8–12 in Table 4), but only with negligible
variations in the enantioselectivity. Interestingly, no changes in
the ratio of diastereoisomers, or in the ee were observed when increasing
the reaction time (compare entries 11 and 12 in Table 4). It is also interesting to note that 3aa is stable in the solid state, but it epimerizes into a
mixture of 3aa/epi-3aa (58/42)
by stirring a solution in DCM for 120 h without catalysts. All these
data show that, in the described reaction conditions, the formation
of epi-3aa is kinetically favored, but
it can be transformed into thermodynamic 3aa over the
time as previously described for related Michael adducts.34,36

The stereochemistry of the products can be explained as summarized
in Scheme 1. Bifunctional
squaramides are responsible of the activation of the nitroolefin by
formation of hydrogen bonds, and help to deprotonate the hydroxyl
group leading to ternary complexes A or C. In those complexes, the first attack occurs to the β-position
of the nitroalkene on the si face in complex A or on the re face in complex C, leading to nitronates B and D, respectively.
This step is responsible for the formation of the stereocenter at
C-2 with configuration S in the first case and R in the second one. Intermediates B and D participate in a second intramolecular nitro-Michael addition
leading to the cyclization products. The addition of the nitronate
by the re face to the si face of
the nitroolefin in B yields (2S,3R,4S)-epi-3. On the contrary, the cyclization from D occurs by
the attack of the si face of the nitronate to the re face of the nitroalkene leading to (2R,3S,4R)-ent-epi-3. The reactions for the enantiotropic
faces in complexes A and C and their intermediates
(B or D) explain the formation of both enantiomers
depending on the organocatalyst. The extension of the partial conversion
of epi-3 into 3 or ent-epi-3 into ent-3 is dependent on the reaction time and may occur through
direct epimerization by deprotonation–protonation at the stereogenic
center bearing the NO2 group at C-3. This epimerization
is supported by the fact that nitroalkene 2f, without
hydrogen atom at C-3 does not modify the composition of the mixture
of diastereoisomers along the time (entries 13, 14 in Table 4).

Conclusions
The
described results showed that different squaramides are good
catalysts that are able to promote stereoselective cascade reactions
leading to enantioenriched 2,3,4-trisubstituted benzopyrans. The enantioselectivity
of the process is good, but the observed diastereoselection varies
from moderate to excellent. The major diastereoisomer isolated is
dependent on the reaction time, and careful control of the catalysts
and the reaction conditions will be necessary to obtain the desired
diastereoisomers.

Experimental Section
General Information
1H NMR (500 MHz) and 13C NMR (126 MHz) spectra
were recorded in CDCl3 or (CD3)2CO
as solvents. Chemical shifts (δ)
are given from TMS, and the residual solvent resonances were taken
as the internal reference. A digital polarimeter at 589 nm (sodium
lamp) was used to measure the specific rotation, and concentrations
are given in g per 100 mL. Fourier transform infrared peaks are reported
in wave numbers, and only the most structurally important ones are
provided. Silica gel (230–240 mesh) was used as support for
flash chromatography. Melting points are uncorrected and were obtained
in open capillary tubes. TLC analysis was carried out on silica gel
60-coated glass plates and visualized with a solution of phosphomolybdic
acid. Chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis
was performed on a Lux-i-Cellulose-5 analytical column (250 ×
4.6 mm). Elemental analyses were performed at the Elemental Analysis
Center of the Complutense University of Madrid.

Commercial compounds
were used without additional purification. Solvents were dried by
standard procedures. 2-(2-Nitrovinyl)phenol derivatives 1a–d(37) and nitroolefins 2e(38) and 2g(39) were prepared as previously reported. Nitroolefins 1a–d and 2f are commercially available. Chiral bifunctional
thiourea 8 and squaramides sq-4–sq-833 were synthesized as described
previously. Racemic samples were obtained in reactions catalyzed by
achiral bifunctional thiourea derived from N1,N1-dimethylethane-1,2-diamine40 (5 mol %) as described for the asymmetric reactions.

Preparation of Polymeric Squaramide sq-9
To
a solution of sq-4 (676 mg, 1.31 mmol) in 1-dodecanol/dry
toluene 3:1 (2.5 mL), styrene (1.5 mL, 13.1 mmol), divinylbenzene
(40 μL, 0.26 mmol), and azobisisobutyronitrile (85 mg, 0.52
mmol) were successively added. The mixture was deoxygenated by bubbling
nitrogen, and the sealed tube was stirred for 24 h in an oil bath
at 70 °C and worked-up as previously described33 to afford 1.58 g of sq-9 as a brown solid
(89% yield). IR (ATR): 2922, 2848, 1601, 1491, 807, 756 cm–1. The effective functionalization (f = 0.44 mmol
g–1) was calculated on the basis of the elemental
analysis of nitrogen (C: 83.27, H: 7.63, N: 1.87).

General Procedure
for the Cascade Reaction of 2-(2-Nitrovinyl)phenol
Derivatives with Nitroolefins
A mixture of nitroolefin (0.4
mmol, 1 equiv), catalyst (0.010 mmol, 0.05 equiv), and 2-(2-nitrovinyl)phenol
derivative (0.2 mmol, 2 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (0.6
mL) was stirred at rt in a Wheaton vial until the end of the reaction
(TLC). The reaction mixture was chromatographed to afford the pure
product. In the reaction promoted by a supported material, the catalyst
was isolated by filtration and washed with MeOH. The diastereomeric
