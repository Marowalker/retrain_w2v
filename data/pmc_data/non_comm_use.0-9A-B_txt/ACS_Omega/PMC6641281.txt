Ammonia
borane (NH3-BH3) is of interest as
a hydrogen storage material because of its ease of use and its ability
to release three molar equivalents of H2(g) via catalytic
hydrolysis. Most heterogeneous catalysts for ammonia borane hydrolysis
are nanoparticles containing expensive noble metals. Here, we show
that metal ruthenate perovskites function as active and durable catalysts
for ammonia borane hydrolysis. As a bulk powder, CaRuO3 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ammonia borane at room temperature and
is recyclable and reusable. CaRuO3 facilitates the release
of H2(g) from aqueous ammonia borane solutions at comparable
rates to some other heterogeneous catalyst systems while having a
low noble metal content. Other ruthenium-based perovskites, including
SrRuO3, Ca2LaRuO6, Sr2CoRuO6, and SrLaCoRuO6, are similarly active
catalysts for room-temperature ammonia borane hydrolysis.

Introduction
Hydrogen gas is a useful
energy carrier that can be produced via
environmentally benign processes, burns cleanly, and has a gravimetric
energy density that is several times higher than that of fossil fuels.1 For use in vehicles, the on-board hydrogen storage
targets set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) state that vehicles
should be capable of storing enough hydrogen to enable a driving range
of >300 miles and that hydrogen storage systems should have a gravimetric
capacity of 7.5 wt % hydrogen.1,2 Compression or liquefaction
of hydrogen gas are possible solutions, but the large resource requirements
for such processes render them unfavorable.1 Alternatively, high storage densities can be achieved through the
chemical storage of hydrogen. Molecules and materials that can achieve
this include metal hydrides,3 metal–organic
frameworks,4 carbon nanotubes,5 and hydrogen-rich molecules and clusters.6

Ammonia borane (NH3-BH3) has also been considered
as a hydrogen storage material.7 Ammonia
borane is a dense, nontoxic, inflammable, and nonexplosive solid at
standard temperature and pressure.7 Ammonia
borane contains 19.6 wt % hydrogen and can release 2–3 molar
equivalents of hydrogen via solvolysis or thermal decomposition.7 Thermal decomposition of ammonia borane evolves
H2(g) but results in the release of only 2 molar equivalents
of hydrogen and requires high temperatures to function.7 Solvolysis in polar, protic solvents via catalytic
methanolysis or hydrolysis can afford 3 molar equivalents of hydrogen
and can occur at room temperature.7

Ideal catalysts for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane should be
highly active, recyclable, and composed primarily of Earth-abundant,
low-cost elements.2 While nanoparticles
of 3d transition metals such as Ni,8−10 Fe,11 and Co12 catalyze ammonia borane
hydrolysis, the most active catalysts are currently composed of noble
metals, including Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru.13−15 The noble metal content
can be diluted via alloying with first-row transition metals, producing
more cost-effective catalysts with only slight decreases in activity.
For example, nanoparticles of CoPd,16 NiRu,17 and M–Pt (M = Fe, Co, and Ni),18 are both highly active and recyclable, although
they still contain up to 75 wt % of noble metals. Other classes of
highly active catalysts include metal phosphides19,20 and nanostructured oxides,21,22 as well as homogeneous
ammonia borane dehydrogenation catalysts that contain ruthenium or
other noble metals.23 The identification
of new classes of catalytic materials for ammonia borane hydrolysis
continues to be an important research goal.

The mechanisms by
which catalysts for ammonia borane hydrolysis
function have been extensively studied.7,19 While different
catalysts can proceed through different pathways, several studies
and observations provide insights that are useful for considering
candidate systems. For example, Ru nanoparticles, which are among
the most highly studied heterogeneous catalysts for ammonia borane
hydrolysis, are prone to surface oxidation.24 This, coupled with enhancements in catalytic performance observed
for oxide-supported Ru nanoparticles,25 suggests that ruthenium-based oxide materials may be interesting
candidates. At the same time, complexes of Ca and Mg are known to
facilitate dehydrocoupling of the related dimethylamineborane molecule,
with the alkaline earth metal centers participating in B–H
and N–H bond-breaking processes.26 Given these considerations, mixed metal ruthenates containing alkaline
earth metals may be of interest as potential candidate materials for
evaluating as heterogeneous catalysts for ammonia borane hydrolysis
to produce molecular hydrogen. Such metal ruthenates include CaRuO3, SrRuO3, Ca2LaRuO6, Sr2CoRuO6, and SrLaCoRuO6, which have been
studied for their magnetic and electronic properties.27−32 We show here that these perovskite-type metal ruthenates function
as heterogeneous catalysts for the room-temperature hydrolysis of
ammonia borane.

Results and Discussion
CaRuO3 and SrRuO3 were synthesized by a coprecipitation
method33 that involved dissolving appropriate
metal salts in water, adding 3 M KOH, and heating the washed and dried
precipitates at 600–900 °C for 24 h. Ca2LaRuO6, Sr2CoRuO6, and SrLaCoRuO6 were synthesized by bulk solid-state reactions of appropriate metal
carbonates and oxides. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for CaRuO3, SrRuO3, Ca2LaRuO6, Sr2CoRuO6, and SrLaCoRuO6 are shown in Figure 1. Comparison of the
experimental XRD patterns with the simulated patterns generated from
published crystallographic data29−32 indicates that all five compounds are phase pure
without observable crystalline impurities. The crystal structure for
CaRuO3, a representative example, is also shown in Figure 1. CaRuO3 and SrRuO3 form GdFeO3-type perovskites with
tilted and distorted octahedra.29 The related
Ca2LaRuO6 perovskite exhibits crystallographic
ordering of the Ca and Ru cations,30 while
Sr2CoRuO6 and SrLaCoRuO6 have disordered
arrangements of the Co and Ru cations.31 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the CaRuO3, SrRuO3, Ca2LaRuO6, Sr2CoRuO6, and SrLaCoRuO6 powders are shown in Figures 2 and S1. All polycrystalline powders had grain sizes
in the range of several hundred nanometers to several micrometers.

The activities of the as-synthesized metal ruthenate
powders for
catalyzing the hydrolysis of ammonia borane were measured at room
temperature (approx. 22 °C) in ultrapure water. RuO2 was synthesized (Figure S2) and tested
for comparison; Pt/C, a known catalyst for ammonia borane hydrolysis,
was also tested (Figure 3). Pt/C catalyzed the hydrolysis of ammonia borane at an average
rate of 43 mL/min, as expected given its known high activity. In contrast,
RuO2 catalyzed the reaction at an average rate of only
0.37 mL/min and therefore was not highly active. CaRuO3, which serves as our prototype metal ruthenate system, achieved
full hydrolysis, with 3 equiv of H2 released per mole of
ammonia borane (confirmed by gas chromatography) at an average rate
of 8.5 mL/min (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Plot showing the number of moles of H2(g) produced per
mole of NH3BH3 vs time from ammonia borane hydrolysis
catalyzed by CaRuO3. Pt/C and RuO2 are also
shown for comparison.

A turnover frequency (TOF) for the CaRuO3-catalyzed
hydrolysis of ammonia borane was calculated to be 7.6 mol(H2) mol(CaRuO3)–1 min–1, based on a conservative estimate that took
the entire amount of CaRuO3 material into account in the
calculation because details of the catalytic active sites of CaRuO3 are not yet known. This TOF, therefore, represents a lower
limit, as the CaRuO3 powder has a low surface area (2.7
m2/g) with a large fraction of the material in the catalytically
inaccessible bulk. Noble metals and their alloys have significantly
higher TOF values,13−19 as do the Earth-abundant nanoparticle systems Ni2P19 and Cu0.8Co0.2O–GO.21 These and other nanoparticle catalysts studied
previously for ammonia borane hydrolysis have diameters of less than
100 nm (many less than 10 nm), which corresponds to a high surface-to-volume
ratio. In contrast, CaRuO3 is a bulk material with grain
sizes of approximately 500 nm to 2 μm and a low surface area.
Methods to synthesize nanoparticles of CaRuO3, which are
not yet available, would significantly increase the surface area and
therefore the density of exposed active sites and the TOF.34 We note that we cannot unequivocally rule out
the possibility that the H2(g) produced from ammonia borane
hydrolysis reacts with the surface of CaRuO3 to produce
Ru nanoparticles. However, control experiments suggest that the observed
catalytic activity is indeed due to CaRuO3 and not Ru(0)
species. X-ray photoelectron spectra indicated that no zero-valent
ruthenium species were present on the surface of a CaRuO3 sample that was recovered after several catalytic cycles, and SEM
coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated the homogeneous
incorporation of Ru and Ca throughout, without observable segregation
(Figure S3).

Recyclability studies
of the CaRuO3 catalyst, evaluated
by repeatedly injecting fresh ammonia borane solutions, are shown
in Figure 4. CaRuO3 maintained high activity for complete ammonia borane hydrolysis
over five cycles, exhibiting only a 5.1% decrease in the rate of the
hydrolysis reaction, which is consistent with the recyclability behavior
of other known ammonia borane catalysts.21 Complementary studies where CaRuO3 was recovered and
reused for five successive cycles showed similar behavior; complete
hydrolysis was observed over all cycles, and TOF values were comparable.
The activation energy required for CaRuO3 to catalyze the
hydrolysis of ammonia borane was determined by measuring the reaction
rates at several reaction temperatures while keeping all other parameters
constant (Figure S4). The activation energy
(Ea) for CaRuO3-catalyzed ammonia
borane hydrolysis, calculated from the Arrhenius plot in Figure S5, was 34 kJ/mol. This activation energy
is comparable to those of Ru nanoparticles,15 Ru nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes,14 NiRu nanoparticles supported on TiO2,17 CoRu nanoparticles supported on Ti3C2X2 (X = OH–, F–),35 Ni2P,19 and Cu0.8Co0.2O supported on graphene
oxide, which range from 12.7 to 45.5 kJ/mol.21

ammonia borane solution every 13 min to the CaRuO3 catalyst.
The plot shows the number of moles of H2(g) produced per
mole of NH3BH3 vs time.

Other metal ruthenates were also found to be active catalysts
for
ammonia borane hydrolysis (Figure 5). SrRuO3 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ammonia
borane at an average rate of 3.5 mL/min and with a TOF of 3.1 mol(H2) mol(SrRuO3)–1 min–1. Ca2LaRuO6, Sr2CoRuO6, and SrLaCoRuO6 catalyze ammonia
borane hydrolysis at average rates of 6.5, 2.3, and 1.7 mL/min, respectively.
The corresponding TOF values, again calculated for low surface area
bulk materials, are 5.8 mol(H2) mol(Sr2CoRuO6)–1 min–1, 2.2 mol(H2) mol(Ca2LaRuO6)–1 min–1, and 1.5
mol(H2) mol(SrLaCoRuO6)–1 min–1, respectively.

the number of moles of H2(g) produced per
mole of NH3BH3 vs time from ammonia borane hydrolysis
catalyzed by SrRuO3, Ca2LaRuO6, Sr2CoRuO6, and SrLaCoRuO6.

While the active sites and the mechanism by which
the metal ruthenates
catalyze ammonia borane hydrolysis are not yet known, the alkaline
earth metals and transition metals both appear to play a role in achieving
the observed catalytic performance, given the significantly higher
activity of the metal ruthenates relative to RuO2 despite
similar crystallinity, grain size, and surface area. This is reasonable,
given the known role of oxide supports and Lewis acidic metals in
promoting and enhancing catalysis in noble metal systems,36 as well as the role that calcium can play in
facilitating the breaking of B–H and N–H bonds in dehydrocoupling
of dimethylamineborane.26

Conclusions
In conclusion, CaRuO3, SrRuO3, Ca2CoRuO6, Sr2LaRuO6, and SrLaCoRuO6 have been identified as catalysts for the hydrolysis of ammonia
borane. Efforts to increase their surface areas, active site densities,
and TOFs through nanostructuring are anticipated to further increase
their rates of hydrolysis. Additionally, other families of complex
oxide materials, which combine multiple metals with synergistic functions
and that contain little or no noble metals, may be viable candidates
to explore as heterogeneous catalysts for ammonia borane hydrolysis.

Methods
Materials
LaCl3·7H2O (Alfa
Aesar), SrCl2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar), SrCO3 (Alfa Aesar), CaCO3 (Alfa Aesar), BaCO3 (Alfa Aesar), Co3O4 (Alfa Aesar), La2O3 (Alfa Aesar), CaCl2·2H2O
(EM Science), RuCl3·xH2O (Sigma-Aldrich), borane ammonia complex (Sigma-Aldrich), Pt/C (E-TEK
Inc.), and KOH (VWR) were used as received without further purification.
Nanopure water (18 MΩ) was obtained from a Barnstead Nanopure
Analytical Ultrapure water system.

Synthesis
CaRuO3 and SrRuO3 were
synthesized via coprecipitation and annealing.33 Stoichiometric amounts of the chloride salts were dissolved
in ultrapure water and stirred using a magnetic stir bar for 5 min.
Then, 5 mL of 3 M KOH(aq) was added to the solution, and the pH was
verified to be above 13. After stirring for 1 h, the solution was
allowed to stand for 2–3 h and was then subsequently washed
with ultrapure water via centrifugation. The resulting black precipitate
was dried and then heated in a muffle furnace for 24 h at 900 °C
for CaRuO3 and 24 h at 600 °C for SrRuO3. Sr2CoRuO6 was synthesized by grinding stoichiometric
amounts of SrCO3 with Co3O4 and RuO2 in a mortar and pestle for 15 min. Subsequently, the ground
powder was pressed into a pellet and heated to 900 °C for 12
h, 1025 °C for 36 h, and 925 °C for 17 h, with intermittent
grinding steps. Ca2LaRuO6 was obtained by grinding
stoichiometric amounts of CaCO3 and La2O3 with RuO2 in a mortar and pestle for 15 min. Subsequently,
the ground powder was pressed into a pellet and heated to 900 °C
at a rate of 15 °C/min. After 12 h, the furnace was turned off
and allowed to cool to room temperature. SrLaCoRuO6 was
synthesized in an identical manner, except stoichiometric amounts
of SrCO3, La2O3, Co3O4, and RuO2 were used. RuO2 was synthesized
by annealing RuCl3 in air for 24 h at 600 °C.

Materials
Characterization
Powder XRD patterns were
collected with a Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE diffractometer with Cu Kα
radiation and a LynxEye 1-D detector. Simulated XRD patterns were
generated with the CrystalMaker/CrystalDiffract software package using
published crystallographic data for each phase (see refs27,30). SEM images
were acquired using a FEI NanoSEM at an accelerating voltage of 7
keV and a working distance of 5.0 mm. Prior to imaging, a 10 nm iridium
coating was sputtered using a Leica EM ACE600 high vacuum coater.
Surface area measurements were performed on an ASAP 2020 Automated
Surface Area and Porosimetry System using N2 gas. Energy-dispersive
spectroscopy data and elemental mapping images were collected at an
accelerating voltage of 20.0 keV and a working distance of 5 mm. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed using
a Physical Electronics VersaProbe II instrument equipped with a monochromatic
Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.7 eV) and
a concentric hemispherical analyzer. Charge neutralization was performed
using both low energy electrons (<5 eV) and argon ions. The binding
energy axis was calibrated using sputter-cleaned Cu foil (Cu 2p3/2 = 932.7 eV, Cu 2p3/2 = 75.1 eV). Peaks were
charge-referenced to the B2O3 band in the boron
1s spectra at 193.0 eV. Measurements were made at a takeoff angle
of 45° with respect to the sample surface plane. This resulted
in a typical sampling depth of 3–6 nm (95% of the signal originated
from this depth or shallower).

Catalysis
An aqueous
solution of ammonia borane was
prepared by dissolving 1 mmol of ammonia borane in 2.4 mL of ultrapure
water. This solution was then injected into a 50 mL round-bottom flask
that contained 0.050 mmol of the catalyst. Released H2(g)
was collected and measured over time using an inverted 100 mL graduated
cylinder until the hydrolysis reaction reached completion. Rates were
calculated by determining the slope of H2(g) production
as a function of time over the linear region. The data were normalized
to account for any preexisting air bubbles in the graduated cylinder.
All catalysts were first activated by injecting the ammonia borane
solution in four separate trials. Activation energies were determined
from data obtained by catalytically hydrolyzing ammonia borane at
room temperature (∼22 °C), 35, 45, and 55 °C. Recyclability
tests were performed by injecting fresh ammonia borane solutions without
purification of the catalyst. The production of H2(g) was
confirmed by gas chromatography via a Shimadzu 2014 System GC equipped
with a Hayesep Q and a Carboxen 1000 column.
