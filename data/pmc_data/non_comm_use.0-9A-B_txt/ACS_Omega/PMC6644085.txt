2-(4-(9,9-Dimethylacridin-10(9H)-yl)phenyl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole has an energy difference
between the lowest excited singlet and triplet states (ΔEST) of ca. 0.24 eV. Introduction of two electronegative
fluorine atoms onto the acceptor portion of the molecule to give 2-(4-(9,9-dimethylacridin-10(9H)-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole lowers
the energy of the singlet emission with a negligible effect on the
corresponding triplet energy, leading to a donor–acceptor compound
with decreased ΔEST of ca. 0.13
eV that displays thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Organic
light-emitting diodes fabricated using the latter compound display
high EQEmax of 21.9% at a luminance of 10 cd/m2 and sky-blue emission, however, they suffer from a large efficiency
roll-off at increased luminance.

Introduction
Use of organic molecules
that exhibit efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)
is recognized as a method for harnessing triplet excitons in organic
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and, at least in principle, makes possible
achievement of internal quantum efficiencies of up to 100%.1−4 TADF involves the thermal upconversion of a triplet exciton to a
singlet exciton through reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), followed
by emission from the singlet state. RISC is facilitated by a low difference
in energy between the singlet state and the triplet state (ΔEST) and by a large spin-orbit coupling between
the states.5,6

The design of purely organic TADF
fluorophores has largely focused on decreasing ΔEST, while keeping the fluorescent decay rate sufficiently
high to compete with nonradiative decay routes, to increase RISC rates,
and, in turn, luminescent efficiency in OLEDs. Assuming the singlet
and triplet excitations are both well-approximated as transitions
between the same two orbitals, ΔEST is equal to twice the exchange energy; this is given by the exchange
integral, J. This can be minimized by decreasing
the spatial overlap of these two relevant orbitals, typically assumed
to be the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO). This is generally achieved through weakly
coupled donor−acceptor architectures in which these orbitals
are primarily localized on the donor and acceptor moieties, respectively.7 An important consideration with this approach
is that constructing a donor–acceptor molecule, in which the
S1 state is well represented as a HOMO to LUMO intramolecular
charge-transfer (CT) transition, does not guarantee that the lowest
lying triplet state, T1, has corresponding 3CT character, as shown in Figure 1. Due to the increased spatial overlap of the relevant
orbitals, donor- or acceptor-localized excited (LE) states exhibit
increased exchange energy relative to CT-type states, potentially
resulting in sufficient stabilization of 3LE states such
that T1 has 3LE character, despite S1 having 1CT
character,8 and in larger ΔEST than would be expected if both S1 and T1 shared the same CT configuration. In such a case,
decreasing the HOMO–LUMO energy separation, by increasing donor
or acceptor strength, while keeping the LE state energies associated
with the building blocks essentially unchanged, is expected to directly
decrease ΔEST.

Figure 1 Hypothetical energy-level
diagram of a donor–acceptor compound. The S1 state
is an intramolecular CT excitation from a donor-localized HOMO to
an acceptor-localized LUMO (1CT), and the 3CT
state is lower in energy than S1 by twice the exchange
integral of the orbitals involved in the CT (JCT). The increased energy of the exchange integral of the acceptor
LE configuration (JLE), attributable to higher spatial overlap of the relevant orbitals
than seen for the CT configuration, stabilizes 3LE such
that this state is lower in energy than 3CT and consequently
is the T1 state.

Here, we report two fluorophores, in which the fluorescence
is consistent with the lowest energy singlet state having CT character,
whereas the triplet-state characteristics are consistent with a LE
state located on the diphenyloxadiazole acceptor. Compounds utilizing
the 2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole acceptor that exhibit TADF have
been reported, including simple D-A compounds pairing it with phenoxazine9 and 5-phenyl-5,10-dihydrophenazine,10 and a D5-A compound utilizing five
carbazolyl donors.11 A computational study
has suggested that using the donor 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine
would also result in a compound exhibiting TADF.12 In this study, we pair 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine
with 2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole in DMAC-DPO (Scheme 1) and, to increase
acceptor strength, a difluoro derivative, DMAC-F2DPO.13

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Acridane-Diphenyloxadiazole Fluorophores
Results and Discussion
The compounds
studied, 2-(4-(9,9-dimethylacridin-10(9H)-yl)phenyl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole
(DMAC-DPO) and 2-(4-(9,9-dimethylacridin-10(9H)-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole (DMAC-F2DPO), are shown
in Scheme 1. They were
obtained in good yield through nucleophilic aromatic substitution
reaction between 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine, prepared via literature
methods,14 and the appropriate 2-(4-fluoroaryl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles 1 and 2 (Scheme 1). The oxadiazoles were prepared through condensation
of 4-fluorobenzoyl chloride or 3,4,5-trifluorobenzoyl chloride, respectively,
with benzohydrazide to yield the corresponding N′-benzoylbenzohydrazide,
followed, without purification, by dehydration in phosphoryl chloride,
as has been reported previously for 1.15,16 The thermal stability of the compounds, an important consideration
in the fabrication of devices composed of vapor-deposited thin films,
was probed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen
atmosphere. DMAC-DPO and DMAC-F2DPO displayed similar decomposition temperatures,
as determined by 5% weight loss in the TGA trace, of 319 and 321 °C,
respectively (SI, Figure S1).

Absorption
and photoluminescence spectra for DMAC-DPO and DMAC-F2DPO in dilute
toluene solution are shown in Figure 2. The absorption spectra of both compounds show absorption
maxima at wavelengths shorter than 300 nm (289 and 290 nm, respectively)
that are attributed to π–π* transitions localized
on the DPO portion of the molecules.17 A
broad, weaker absorption band at wavelengths longer than 300 nm was
observed for each compound, with λmax at 360 nm in DMAC-DPO and 376 nm in DMAC-F2DPO, consistent with an intramolecular CT transition
between the acridane donor and diphenyloxadiazole acceptor. The room-temperature
steady-state photoluminescence spectra of the fluorophores, attributed
to fluorescence, show the same broad, structureless lineshape. As
with the long-wavelength absorption feature, the emission maximum
is bathochromatically shifted with the stronger acceptor, from 449
nm in DMAC-DPO to 490 nm in DMAC-F2DPO. Similarly, from the fluorescence
onsets in toluene, we estimate that the S1 state of DMAC-F2DPO is stabilized
by 0.14 eV relative to that of DMAC-DPO (see Table 1). These observations
are consistent with assignment of the S1 states of both
compounds to intramolecular CT states, with the fluoro substituents
increasing the acceptor strength in DMAC-F2DPO. This assignment is further supported
by solvent-dependent measurements (see SI, Figure S2): for both compounds the absorption is only weakly solvent-dependent,
whereas the emission is substantially red shifted, and, therefore,
the Stokes shift, is significantly increased, with increasing solvent
polarity, as expected for compounds in which the emissive state has
a dipole moment much larger than that of the ground state.

To assess the
T1 energy, the photoluminescence at 77 K was collected
in a toluene matrix with a 500 μs delay between excitation and
data collection; these spectra are attributed to phosphorescence.
In contrast to the fluorescence, the phosphorescence spectra of the
two compounds are almost superimposable, indicating little sensitivity
to fluorine substitution on the acceptor moiety. The T1 energies, estimated from the onset of phosphorescence, are 2.78
and 2.75 eV for DMAC-DPO and DMAC-F2DPO, respectively. Furthermore,
the lineshape of the emission of both compounds resembles that of
an isolated 1,3,4-diphenyloxadiazole.17 The 77 K delayed emission is, therefore, assigned to emission from
a T1 state localized on the DPO moiety, rather than (as
previously predicted theoretically12) a
CT state with a similar origin to the S1 state. Due to
the stabilization of S1 with increased acceptor strength
and the largely unchanged T1 energy, the estimated ΔEST is decreased from 0.24 eV in DMAC-DPO to 0.13 eV in DMAC-F2DPO. Solution-state photophysical data for each compound are
summarized in Table 1.

To probe whether the decreased ΔEST of DMAC-F2DPO would lead to TADF, the transient photoluminescence in dilute toluene
solution was collected, and is shown in Figure 3. After sparging the solution with nitrogen
gas to reduce the concentration of triplet-quenching molecular oxygen,
a two-component decay is observed. The fast component, with a lifetime
of τPF = 8.8 ns (see SI, Figure S3), and a slow component, with a lifetime of τDF = 179 μs, are assigned to prompt fluorescence and TADF, respectively.
Upon equilibrating with air, the slow component disappears. Furthermore,
the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) increases from 0.16 in air-equilibrated
solution to 0.24 upon sparging with nitrogen. In contrast, DMAC-DPO shows only a single, fast component in the transient fluorescence
after sparging with nitrogen (see SI, Figure S3), and the PLQY only slightly increases, from 0.16 to 0.18. These
data are consistent with a higher RISC rate in the case of DMAC-F2DPO, as expected from the lower estimate of ΔEST obtained.

Figure 3 Time-resolved photoluminescence of DMAC-F2DPO in nitrogen-sparged
solution (red) shows a two-component decay, including a long-lived
component with τ = 179 μs. After aeration, the long-lived
component is quenched (black).

To better understand the properties of the emitter in an
environment more relevant to an OLED device, thin films containing DMAC-F2DPO doped at 12.5
wt % into a thin film comprised of bis(2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl)ether
oxide (DPEPO), obtained via spin-casting from chloroform in air followed
by drying under high vacuum, were also photophysically characterized
(See Table 1 and SI, Figure S4). The ambient-temperature steady-state
emission and the 77 K delayed emission are both quite similar to the
corresponding spectra acquired in toluene solution, but with slight
red shifts in the maxima and onsets, and a slightly larger estimated
ΔEST value of 0.16 eV. The delayed
fluorescence lifetime of 113 μs is somewhat shorter than that
in toluene solution.

DMAC-F2DPO was incorporated into an OLED to assess its electroluminescent
properties and to provide further evidence for T1-to-S1 upconversion. The device structure, adopted from our recent
work on blue to blue-green TADF OLEDs without optimization,18,19 is shown below in Figure 4a, along with chemical structures of organic materials used,
and was as follows: glass/ITO/MoO3 (15 nm)/Poly-TriCZ (80
nm)/DPEPO:DMAC-F2DPO (25 nm, 25 wt %)/TP3PO(4 nm)/TPBi(50 nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al(50 nm)/Ag(100
nm). The thin layer of molybdenum trioxide was evaporated as a hole-injection
layer. The 80 nm thick poly-TriCZ hole-transporting layer was spin-coated
(500 rpm for 60 s) from a chlorobenzene solution (10 mg mL–1) and thermally annealed (110 °C for 2 min) in a nitrogen-filled
glovebox. The emissive layer (EML) was deposited via a co-evaporation
of DPEPO, selected due to its high triplet state energy of ca. 3 eV,20 and the emitter with a concentration of the
latter of 25 wt %. Sequentially deposited TP3PO and TPBi were layers
used as electron-transport layers. Lithium fluoride was deposited
to improve the electron injection between a 50 nm thick aluminum cathode
and the organic layers. A silver layer was deposited atop the aluminum
to assist with the contact between the devices and the test setup.
The typical OLED active area was 3.0 × 3.0 mm2. All
thermal vacuum depositions were performed at pressures below 1.0 ×
10–7 Torr.

(EL) spectrum, (c) current–voltage–luminance (J–V–L) characteristics, and (d) external quantum
efficiency of OLED device containing DMAC-F2DPO as the emitter.

The electroluminescent spectrum of the OLED, shown in Figure 4b, matched the photoluminescent
spectrum of DMAC-F2DPO in a DPEPO-doped thin film, displaying emission with λmax at 494 nm and CIE coordinates of x = 0.22
and y = 0.46. Current–voltage–luminance
characteristics are shown in Figure 4c and indicate a turn-on voltage, corresponding to
a luminance of 10 cd m–2, of 3.5 V. The variation
of external quantum efficiency (EQE) with luminance is shown in Figure 4d: at low luminance
(ca. 10 cd m–2), the device displayed a high EQEmax of 21.9%, which is well above the theoretical maximum EQE
for a device that converts only the singlet excitons formed directly
on charge recombination into light21 and
provides further support that triplet excitons are upconverted to
singlets through the TADF process in DMAC-F2DPO. The relatively high PLQY of the compound
in the solid state (Table 1) also contributes to the high EQEmax. On the other
hand, the device displayed significant efficiency roll-off; the EQE
at a luminance of 1000 cd m–2 was reduced to only
6.9%. Roll-off can be influenced by a variety of factors; however,
the τDF of 113 μs, which is moderately long
compared to many state-of-the-art TADF emitters, is likely a major
contributor in this case.22 The different
S1 and T1 characters in this case are expected
to help facilitate RISC and TADF through increasing the spin-orbit
coupling,6 but the apparent value of ΔEST (ca. 0.16 eV in DPEPO, Table 1) is not as low as in many recently developed
chromophores.2

Conclusions
In
summary, two new donor–acceptor compounds were synthesized
in which the S1 states are characterized as intramolecular
CT states, whereas the T1 states are characterized as LE
states. Substitution of fluorine onto the acceptor stabilized the
CT transition by ca. 0.14 eV with negligible effect on the T1 state, leading to a fluorophore that displayed TADF. Incorporation
of the compound into the emissive layer OLED with a DPEPO host yielded
a high external quantum efficiency at low luminance, but also large
efficiency roll-off.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All reagents were purchased from commercial sources and were used
without further purification. 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance IIIHD 500
instrument operating at 500, 125, and 470 MHz, respectively. Chemical
shifts are listed in parts per million (ppm) and were referenced using
the residual nondeuterated solvent 1H signal or the solvent 13C resonance. Column chromatography was carried out using
silica gel (60 Å, 40–63 μm, Sorbent) as the stationary
phase. Mass spectra were measured on VG Instruments 70-SE using electron
impact (EI) mode. UV–vis spectra were measured using a Cary
5000 UV–vis–NIR Spectrophotometer. Fluorescence, phosphorescence,
and emission transients were collected on a Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3
equipped with a pulsed xenon lamp, photomultiplier tube (Horiba R928),
and pulsed LED excitation source (NanoLED, 336 nm). Fluorescent lifetimes
were fit using DAS6 decay analysis software. Solution and solid-state
absolute photoluminescence quantum yields were determined with a Quantaurus-QY
C11347 spectrometer; samples were excited at 330 nm.
