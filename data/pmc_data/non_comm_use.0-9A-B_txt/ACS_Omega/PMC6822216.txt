In this study, a
3D reactive flow simulation model is built to
simulate the leakage processes though assumed leakage channels. The
geochemical reactions are coupled with fluid flow simulation in this
model with consideration of reservoir minerals calcite, kaolinite,
and anorthite. As an essential trigger for geochemical reactions,
changes in pH value are investigated during and after the CO2 injection process. By comparing CO2 migration with/without
geochemical reactions, the influence of geochemical processes on CO2 leakage is illustrated. The leakage behaviors through leakage
channels with different permeabilities are evaluated. Influence of
reservoir temperature on CO2 leakage is also exhibited.
Furthermore, the effects of the distance between the injection well
and leakage zone on the leakage potential are studied. The results
indicate that the geochemical reactions have impact on the leakage
processes, which can decrease the leakage level with the presence
of geochemical reactions. The region of low pH enlarges with continuous
injection of CO2. Hence, monitoring changes in pH can reflect
the migration of CO2, which can provide an alert for CO2 leakage. The occurrence of the leakage phenomenon is postponed
with increasing the distance between the CO2 injection
well and the leakage channel. However, the leakage level tends to
be consistent with injecting more CO2. The CO2 leakage risk can be reduced through the leakage channels with lower
permeability. With the presence of higher reservoir temperatures,
the leakage risk can be improved. These results can provide references
for the application of monitoring methods and prediction of CO2 front associated with geochemical processes.

1 Introduction
Global warming is becoming
a serious threat to the environment,
which are caused by the significant man-made emissions of greenhouse
gases.1,2 CO2 is definitely the representative
of greenhouse gases due to human’s overreliance on traditional
fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas).3 Greenhouse gas control has become a focal point of the 21st Century.
In the 2015 COP21, also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference,
the issue of greenhouse gas control was also emphasized and attracts
more and more attention from many aspects of the society.4 An important route in dealing with this issue
is via a CO2 geological storage as part of carbon capture,
utilization, and storage (CCUS) systems.5,6 There is a
strong case for the need of CCUS in the future energy mix if modern
human society wishes to maintain economic development following its
historic and current dependence on traditional fossil energy. There
are different kinds of geological structures, such as deep saline
aquifers, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, and deep unminable coal
seams,7−9 that can be storage candidates for the CO2 geological storage process. CO2 geological storage associated
with deep saline aquifers has a promising future because of its wide
distribution and enormous storage potentials. Many demonstration projects
conducted in recent years have proved that the CO2 storage
in deep saline aquifers can be an effective method in eliminating
the negative effects of greenhouse gas emissions. However, the safety,
with regard to CO2 leakage, has always been an eminent
issue for public concern, with many potential pathways and unknown
factors. The rock-fluid interactions may change the property of the
caprock and weaken the seal layer. Hence, it is very important to
monitor CO2 migration and investigate the leakage mechanisms
during CO2 storage process.10 Meanwhile, geochemical processes could influence the CO2 migration front, which may affect the timeliness of monitoring technologies,
especially in a large scale. Geochemical reactions can change the
permeabilities of storage reservoirs and leakage channels, which serve
a key role in altering CO2 migration rules.

In the
early stage, CO2 geological storage capacity
and mechanisms are hot issues during the application of CCUS. The
available storage structures mainly include deep saline aquifer, unminable
coal seams, and depleted oil and gas reservoir etc.7,11−13 Combination of CO2 storage and enhanced
oil recovery (EOR) is also welcome, with benefits in both environment
and economic efficiency.14 At the same
time, it is theoretically feasible to inject CO2 to replace
CH4 in natural gas hydrate deposits, which can serve as
an alternative way to develop unconventional energy and eliminate
CO2 emissions.15,16 Evaluation on CO2 geological storage potential indicates that different storage
geostructures have different storage capacities with various storage
mechanisms. However, the leakage risks using different storage structures
have diverse levels. The technical feasibility of CCUS has been demonstrated
by field applications, but the economic and safety issues restrict
the further development of CO2 geological storage. Implementation
of carbon tax can improve the economic efficiency. Nevertheless, the
public always worries and doubts about the potential leakage risk
associated with CO2 geological storage projects. CO2 leakage will eliminate the environmental benefits, which
is provided by CO2 geological storage activities or damage
the ecosystem.17,18 Therefore, it is important to
investigate the leakage behaviors and mechanisms with the presence
of leakage channels.

Some research works have been carried out
to study the leakage
mechanisms and behaviors. Nordbotten et al.19 applied a novel framework for predicting the leakage channels connecting
multiple subsurface permeable formations. The capabilities of the
model on typical field data were demonstrated. Their results showed
the flexibility and utility of the solution methods. Song and Zhang20 gave a comprehensive review of caprock-sealing
mechanisms for a CO2 geological storage project. The review
exhibited that CO2 leakage can be rapid and catastrophic
through faults or fracture networks, whereas diffusive loss is usually
low. Jordan et al.21 built a reduced-order
model to predict CO2 and brine leakages along the wellbores
into the surface or the overlying aquifer. The influences of wellbore
properties and the state of the CO2 plume on leakage profiles
are also investigated. The results indicate that minima in flow rates
exhibited in the response surface are induced by a complex nonlinear
phase behavior along the wellbore. CO2 leakage can be increased
with the presence of a shallow aquifer by comparing with the cases
that CO2 directly leak to the land surface. Class et al.22 carried out a benchmark study on the problem
related to CO2 storage in geologic formations. They applied
different simulators to study the CO2 leakage through an
assumed leakage channel, methane recovery enhanced by CO2 injection and a field-scale injection scenario into a heterogeneous
formation. A description of the benchmark problems and a brief introduction
on participating codes are provided in their study. The results of
the benchmark study are also presented and discussed. Zhang et al.10 illustrated and analyzed the monitoring process
of CO2 storage safety and leakage in the CCS demonstration
project of the Jilin oilfield in China. They demonstrated that the
monitoring of targets should be focused on the reservoir, near-surface,
and injection and production systems, as shown by field experience. It can not only prevent
CO2 leakage, but also avoid the blind expansion of monitoring
program scopes by applying monitoring methods to ensure the integrity
of wellbores. Their works can provide valuable guidance for the further
enlarged Jilin project and other CO2 EOR and geological
storage operations.

In this paper, a geological scale 3D reactive
flow simulation model
is built to simulate the leakage processes though the assumed leakage
channels in typical caprock–aquifer geological storage systems.
The dissolution/precipitation reactions are coupled with fluid flow
simulations in this model with considerations for reservoir minerals
calcite, kaolinite, and anorthite. As an essential trigger for geochemical
reactions, the changes in pH value are investigated during and after
the CO2 injection process. The influence of the reservoir
temperature on CO2 leakage is illustrated. CO2 leakage potential through leakage channels with different permeabilities
is evaluated. The effects of the distance between the CO2 injection well and the leakage channel on the leakage potential
are investigated.

2 Reactive Flow Simulation
Model
Literature researches indicate that the existence of
a leakage
channel is key risk point for CO2 storage safety and the
leakage mechanisms can be influenced by environmental and anthropogenic
factors. It is meaningful to study the dynamic leakage behaviors and
their mechanisms with the presence of a leakage channel in typical
CO2 geological storage systems. Meanwhile, the study on
CO2 leakage can provide a reference for the implementation
of CO2 monitoring methods and projects, which is beneficial
for increasing the CO2 geological storage safety and enhancing
the public confidence in CO2 geological storage. The background
data of this study are according to topic 1, which is given at the
Workshop on Numerical Models for CO2 Storage in Geological
Formations that took place from 2–4 April, 2008, in Stuttgart,
Germany. Compositional simulator is adopted to set up the 3D reactive
flow simulation model of typical caprock–aquifer system for
investigating CO2 leakage behaviors and mechanisms during
the CO2 geological storage process.22 The existence of leakage channels with high permeability
inside the caprock or seal layer can induce an upward migration of
CO2 and increase the leakage risk potential. Hence, a 3D
reactive flow simulation model is built for studying CO2 leakage behaviors and mechanisms in typical caprock–aquifer
system as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 3D model to simulate CO2 leakage during CO2 geological storage in a typical caprock–aquifer system.

The blank area between two color layers represents
a sealing layer.
The assumed aquifer overlaying the caprock is 1000 m in length, 500
m in width, and 30 m in thickness, respectively. The length, width,
and thickness of the reservoir for CO2 storage are the
same as the aquifer. The CO2 storage reservoir is covered
with a caprock of 100 m in thickness. Initial porosity and permeability
of the reservoir and aquifer are set to be 0.15 and 20 × 10–3 μm2, respectively. Moreover, the
reference depth is set to be 800 m with a reference pressure of 8.5
MPa. All the layers in the reservoir are perforated. Injection of
CO2 in a liquid phase continues over a period of 20 years
with a constant injection rate of 20,5000 m3/day. Mover,
aqueous, and mineral reactions during the simulation process are taken
into consideration with the related geochemical reaction rate models
as follows.23

Equilibrium condition
of aqueous reactions in the compositional
simulator can be exhibited as 1  where  is the activity product for aqueous reaction
α, and it can be expressed as eq 2 2  where ak is the activity coefficient for component k; Raq is the amount of aqueous reactions; andis the chemical equilibrium constant of
aqueous reaction α, which can be expressed by eq 3 3  where R is
the molar gas constant; T is the temperature; and
ΔG0 is the Gibbs energy under standard
condition.

The chemical equilibrium constants of geochemical
reactions including
aqueous reactions and mineral reactions vary with temperature. Therefore,
a fourth-order polynomial with varying temperatures is used in this
study as shown in eq 4. 4  

Given that relative slow reaction
rate of mineral reactions, the
following reactive rate formula is applied in this model 5  where Âβ is
the reaction surface area of the mineral reaction
β per volume of porous medium rock; kβ is the reaction rate constant of the mineral reaction β; Qβ is the activity product of the mineral
reaction; Keq,β is the chemical
equilibrium constant of mineral reactions.

Mineral reactions
may induce changes on porosity, which will influence
the permeability of CO2 geological storage reservoirs and
leakage zones. In the compositional simulator, porosity change can
be depicted as eq 6 6  where ϕ is the porosity; r̂k is the mean grain size of mineral particles; N̂k is the amount of mineral particles
per rock volume; and rk is the dissolution
reaction rate of mineral k.

In order to reflect the relationship
between porosity and permeability,
the Kozeny–Carman equation is inserted into the reactive simulation
model and its expression is as follows24 7  where k is
the real-time permeability; k0 is the
initial permeability; ϕ is the real-time porosity; ϕ0 is the initial porosity; and n is the correlation
coefficient. In this study, the value of n is assumed
to be 1. With the presence of a stronger relationship between porosity
and permeability, the influence of mineral reactions on reservoir
properties can be enhanced with the value of n larger
than 1. In addition, the equations and correlation coefficients of
the aqueous and mineral reactions in this study are shown in Tables 1–3.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Influence of Geochemical
Reactions on CO2 Leakage
By comparing with the
scenario without considering
geochemical reactions, the leakage behaviors can be analyzed with
the presence of geochemical reactions. At the same time, the mineral
trapping mechanism during CO2 geological storage process
can also be exhibited at some extent. As shown in Figure 2, grid (15, 13, 1/5, 1, 1),
and grid (15, 13, 1/5, 5, 1) are selected as the no.1 and no.2 reference
points for monitoring the change in CO2 saturation, respectively.
The distance between the leakage channel and the CO2 injection
well is set to 100 m. The permeability of leakage channel is assumed
to be 1000 × 10–3 μm2.

Figure 2 The location
of reference point.

CO2 saturation
decreases from 0.69047 to 0.68997 at
the no.1 reference point with considering geochemical reactions after
20 years of CO2 injection. This phenomenon indicates that
the beneficial mineral reactions can trap CO2 during CO2 geological storage processes to some extent. Given that the
selected CO2 injection period is relatively short and the
relationship between porosity and permeability is a weak correlation,
the mineral trapping mechanism is not very significant with relatively
small changes in CO2 saturation. However, the total storage
capacity of CO2 based on mineral trapping mechanisms can
be considerable in view of actual injection volume and storage period.
Therefore, it is beneficial to enlarge the positive effects of mineral
trapping mechanisms on the CO2 permanent storage by mastering
the mineral distribution and total amount when selecting storage sites.
Meanwhile, the accuracy of the leakage monitoring method can be improved
with further insights on corresponding mineral reactions, which causes
the delayed leakage with the presence of related geochemical reactions.

3.2 Changes in pH
A change in pH is induced
after CO2 dissolves in water. pH is an important parameter
to evaluate the tendency of different geochemical reactions. At the
same time, the change in pH can reflect the CO2 migration
front at some extent in CO2 storage projects. Hence, monitoring
the change in pH can provide an alert for CO2 leakage and
predict the potential zones for special reactions, which need an environment
of low pH. The distance between the CO2 injection well
and the leakage channel is set to be 100 m. Permeability of the leakage
channel is assumed to be 1000 × 10–3 μm2. Reservoir temperature of 60 °C is adopted in this reactive
flow simulation model. As can be seen in Figure 3, a low pH region becomes larger with the
continuous injection of CO2 during the storage process
and can spread to the aquifer overlying the caprock with the presence
of a leakage channel.

Figure 3 Change in pH during the CO2 injection process
at reservoir
temperature of 60 °C (note: red color of the ruler in the figure
represents the pH range of 6.9–7.7. With the hue becoming cold,
the pH decreases and the dark blue color indicates a pH range of 0.0
to 0.8.) (a) pH before CO2 injection, (b) pH after 50 days
of CO2 injection, (c) pH after 500 days of CO2 injection, and (d) pH after 20 years of CO2 injection

Therefore, monitoring changes in low pH areas can
reflect the degree
of CO2 escape and can also provide an early warning of
some harmful reactions that require a low pH environment. Based on
modeling and experimental studies, a decrease in aqueous pH associated
with CO2 leakage into the overlaying aquifer will induce
increased aqueous concentrations of a wide range of metals (such as
Pb, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, V, and U).25,26 CO2-induced decrease in pH can also weaken the integrity of the injection
and production wells by damaging their cement ring and wellbore.10 After 20 years of CO2 injection,
the pH can be as low as 4.7 in the aquifer overlaying the caprock.

3.3 Influence of Leakage Channel Permeability
Leakage channels with different permeabilities can induce CO2 leakage at different scales. It is of great significance
to study the influence of permeability of the leakage channel on the
CO2 leakage performance during the CO2 storage
process. Four kinds of leakage channels with the permeability of 1,
10, 100, and 1000 × 10–3 μm2, respectively, are selected to study the influence of leakage channel
permeability on CO2 leakage behaviors. The distance between
the CO2 injection well and the leakage channel is set to
be 100 m and the reservoir temperature is assumed to be 60 °C.

As can be achieved in Figure 4, the CO2 leakage risk increases with increasing
permeability of the leakage channel, which can be expressed by an
enlarged distribution range of CO2 in the overlying aquifer.
It is notable that the leakage risk can be reduced significantly with
the presence of a relatively lower permeability (10 × 10–3 μm2), which indicates that CO2 leakage can be controlled with blocking the leakage channel
to some extent, and it is unnecessary to plug the leakage channels
thoroughly. In addition, the leakage control costs can also be reduced
with applying a relatively small amount of blocking materials.

with different permeabilities after 20 years of CO2 injection

3.4 Influence of Distance between
Leakage Channel
and CO2 Injection Well
For some storage cases,
there may exist some potential leakage channels, which can be triggered
by the injection activity. These kinds of potential leakage channels
can keep a close state without CO2 injection, which provide
barriers for the subsurface fluid migration. However, CO2 injection activity may disturb the relatively stable state of leakage
channels that leads the leakage channels to an open state. Therefore,
the influence of distance between the leakage channel and CO2 injection well on the leakage performance is estimated.

Changes
of CO2 saturation in the no.2 reference point with the
presence of different distances between the leakage channel and the
CO2 injection is applied to investigate the distance influence
on leakage behaviors in this study. The leakage channel is assumed
to be open in this reactive flow simulation process. The reservoir
temperature is set to be 60 °C. The permeability of leakage channels
is assumed to be 1000 × 10–3 μm2. The distances of leakage channels and CO2 injection
wells are set to be 20 m, 25 m, 30 m, 40 m, 60 m, 75 m, 90 m, and
100 m. As can be achieved in Figure 5, the leakage is postponed with increasing the distance.
However, the leakage levels tend to be consistent with injecting more
CO2.

Figure 5 Changes of CO2 saturation in the no.2 reference
point
with different distances between the leakage channel and the CO2 injection well.

3.5 Influence
of Reservoir Temperature
It is of a certain guiding significance
to investigate the influence
of temperature on leakage behaviors for the selection of geological
storage reservoirs and understanding the safety of geological storage
reservoirs with different temperatures.

Changes of CO2 saturation in the no.2 reference point are applied here to study
the influence of reservoir temperature on the leakage performance.
The distance between the leakage channel and the CO2 injection
well is assumed to be 100 m and the permeability of leakage channel
is set to be 1000 × 10–3 μm2. As can be seen in Figure 6, the CO2 leakage rate accelerates with the increase
in reservoir temperature, which can be exhibited by the steepening
curve of CO2 saturation. Moreover, the leakage level enlarges
with the presence of a higher reservoir temperature that can be achieved
by the comparison of the CO2 saturation at higher reservoir
temperatures and lower reservoir temperatures after 20 years of CO2 injection in the no.2 reference point. Hence, storage reservoirs
with relatively lower reservoir temperatures are recommended to be
candidates for CO2 geological storage when other conditions
are similar, which may slow down the leakage rate or reduce the leakage
risk with the presence of a potential leakage path. However, deeper
storage can also decrease the leakage risk of CO2 to the
atmosphere. Therefore, it is important to avoid the storage reservoirs
with abnormally high temperatures.

the no.2 reference point
with different reservoir temperatures

4 Conclusions
CO2 geological storage
has become one of the research
priorities worldwide in recent years, which can reduce greenhouse
gas emissions. During the CO2 storage process, existing
or newly generated leakage channels are inevitable because of natural
and man-made geological activities. Hence, the storage safety in terms
of CO2 leakage has always been an eminent issue for concern.
In this study, a 3D reactive flow simulation model is built to investigate
the influence of geochemical reactions, reservoir temperature, and
the permeability of leakage channels on leakage behaviors. The influence
of distance between the injection well and the leakage channel on
leakage risk is also evaluated. At the same time, changes in pH during
the leakage process are exhibited. The following conclusions can be
drawn from the above study.(1) The leakage risk can be reduced with
the presence of geochemical reactions. Storage reservoirs with suitable
minerals are recommended to be the candidates for CO2 geological
storage. A low pH region enlarges with the continuous injection of
CO2, which can reflect the front of CO2 migration.
Therefore, monitoring the change in pH can give an alert on CO2 leakage and predict the potential zone for harmful reactions,
which need an environment of low pH.

(2) The leakage level reduces with decreasing
the permeability of the leakage channel. Leakage risk can be reduced
significantly with the presence of a relatively lower permeability
(10 × 10–3 μm2), which indicates
that CO2 leakage can be controlled without plugging the
leakage channels thoroughly.

(3) The occurrence of a leakage phenomenon
can be postponed with increasing the distance between the CO2 injection well and the leakage channel. However, the leakage level
tends to be consistent with injecting more CO2.

(4) CO2 leakage
rate accelerates
with increasing reservoir temperature. The leakage level enlarges
with the presence of higher reservoir temperature. Hence, storage
reservoirs with relatively lower reservoir temperatures are recommended
to be candidates for CO2 geological storage when other
conditions are similar.
