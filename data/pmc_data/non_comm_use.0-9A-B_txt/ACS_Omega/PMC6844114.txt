A composite solid polymer electrolyte
(CSPE) is studied in this
work to alleviate the concerns associated with poor mechanical strength
of a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) system composed of poly(ethyleneglycol)diacrylate,
an electrolyte lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide, and a plasticizer
succinonitrile. CSPE is fabricated by incorporating the ingredients
of SPE in the macroporous membranes of syndiotactic polystyrene to
render flexibility and mechanical robustness with a 6-fold increase
in tensile strength over SPE. The data from differential scanning
calorimetry and wide-angle X-ray diffraction confirm the amorphous
nature of the polymeric domains of SPE that produce high room-temperature
ionic conductivity of ∼0.43 mS/cm. The flexible CSPE membranes
are used as the electrolyte in Li-ion battery (LIB) half cells in
conjunction with lithium iron phosphate as the counter electrode.
The use of CSPE helps expand the electrochemical window of the cell
to 5 V, indicating strong potential in the fabrication of flexible
rechargeable LIBs.

Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have drawn
significant attention since
the 1990s because of a number of valuable features such as long cycle
life and high power and energy density.1 A strong demand for safe and efficient electronics presents pressing
needs for high-performance batteries. However, the traditional organic
carbonate-based electrolytes in commercial LIBs often lead to serious
safety concerns owing to leakage and flammability. To move toward
safe operation of LIBs, researchers focused their attention in the
past three decades on solvent-free, solid-state electrolytes. Solid
polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are ion conducting solid materials where
the majority component is a polymer. The use of SPEs presents several
advantages over the use of volatile liquid electrolytes, such as alleviating
the concerns of internal short circuit, swelling, leakage, and fire
in batteries, along with the ease of processing.2 Most SPEs are fabricated from lithium salts dissolved in
ion-solvating polymers, such as polyethylene oxide (PEO), propylene
oxide, poly(ethylene imine), and polyalkane sulfide.3 The ionic conductivity of SPEs are usually in the range
of 0.01–1 mS/cm at room temperature.

An early discussion
about the conductivity of PEO began in 1975,
and the prospect of using PEO inspired further investigations on solid-state
batteries.4,5 The flexible chains and ethylene oxide functional
groups make PEO one of the most promising polymers for solid electrolyte
system. Nevertheless, the semicrystalline structures of pristine PEO
and PEO/bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amine lithium (LiTFSI) complexes
lead to rather low ionic conductivity (σ) at room temperature
(σ ≈ 10–3 mS/cm). The low ionic conductivity,
in turn, hinders direct application of PEO as an efficient electrolyte
for LIBs, although the amorphous phase provides fast ion conduction.6−8 Owing to this reason, LIBs fabricated with PEO-based SPE do not
function well at ambient temperatures and require a general operational
temperature of above 60 °C to obtain higher values of ionic conductivity.9

The most common strategy to reduce the
operating temperature and
to hinder PEO crystallinity relies upon the addition of molecules
that lowers the glass transition temperature (Tg).10−15 Recently, solid electrolyte systems based on plastic crystals have
been reported.16−18 The organic solid plasticizers offer good compatibility
with the host polymer, such as PEO, without severe phase separation.
Therefore, the polymer/lithium salt/plasticizer ternary system can
be tuned to specific compositions to fulfill the requirements of ionic
conductivity and electrochemical stability. For example, succinonitrile
is used as a solid plasticizer for various polymeric-salt systems
containing PEO, poly(acrylonitrile), and poly(ethylene terephthalate).19,20 Even though the ionic conductivity is improved from 10–4 to 1 mS/cm at 30 °C,21,22 the mechanical strength
of SPEs is compromised because of the use of large amounts of plasticizers
in the system.11,23 In a typical ternary system consisting
of LiTFSI/poly(ethyleneglycol)diacrylate (PEGDA)/succinonitrile, the
highest achievable tensile strength is 0.2 MPa.24 Flexible and wearable electronics with flexible energy-storage
devices are expected to gain high importance.25,26 Consequently, SPEs must not only meet the required ionic conductivity
values, but also offer required mechanical strength at ambient temperature
than what is available in current technologies.

The present
work uses flexible macroporous membranes with >90%
porosity obtained from thermoreversible gels of syndiotactic polystyrene
(sPS). The pores of sPS gels are filled with ternary mixtures of LiTFSI/PEGDA/succinonitrile
in the weight ratio of 35/25/40 to decouple the known negative impact
of plasticizers on the mechanical strength of SPE. In this composite
solid polymer network (CSPE), the ionic conductivity can be increased
substantially using succinonitrile as the plasticizer, whereas the
mechanical strength and dimensional stability are derived from the
solid fibrillar strand networks of sPS with a typical diameter of
50 nm.27,28 Note that the solid strands of sPS have
a crystalline melting temperature of ∼270 °C and a glass
transition temperature of ∼100 °C. The SPE formulation
in the pores serves as the ionically conductive network. The impact
of high surface area sPS strands of a typical diameter of 50 nm in
the gel on crystallinity of SPE and hence, on the ionic conductivity
of CSPE, was investigated. The performance of LIB half-cells fabricated
with the CSPE was examined.

Results and Discussion
Several morphological
information of the CSPE membrane were deemed
important in this work—the % porosity of sPS gel membrane,
the sPS polymer domain architecture, and if all of the pores of sPS
gel were filled in the final SPE materials. Figure 1 shows the scanning electron microscopy images
of sPS aerogel monoliths (Figure 1a) and the film (Figure 1b). Enlarged views of the solid film morphology of
the surface and the cross-sectional area of the film are presented
in Figure 1c,d, respectively.
It is apparent that the top surface of the film (Figure 1c) was porous, giving indication
that the CSPE membrane would not hinder transport of ions across the
membrane. The cross-sectional area of the films in Figure 1d is highly tortuous. Such
high tortuosity presents desirable attributes to deter lithium dendrite
growth. The macroporous structures of sPS aerogels were used earlier
in removing airborne nanoparticles of 75 nm mean diameter with close
to 100% efficiency and air permeability of 10–10 m2.28,29Figure 2a,b show optical images of CSPE specimens
after multiple bending and wrapping around a cylindrical wand, respectively, indicating that CSPE membranes
obtained in this work were highly flexible and therefore, amenable
to usage in the fabrication of energy storage devices in wearable
technology installations. The corresponding SPE membranes required
delicate handling because they broke easily. The porosity of sPS aerogel
was 90% as determined from the values of bulk density and skeletal
density, the latter obtained using helium pycnometer. Such high porosity
of sPS membranes allowed higher loading of SPE in the CSPE membranes,
eventually achieving higher ionic conductivity. Figure 2c presents an optical image of cross section
of the fractured CSPE film, indicating that all pores on the cross-sectional
plane of sPS gel were filled with SPE.

The thermal stability of SPEs, which is an important factor for
solving the safety issues in batteries, was determined from thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA). Figure 3a shows the % weight versus temperature for all of the components
in SPE and CSPE obtained using TGA under nitrogen environment. On
the basis of the weight loss versus temperature curves in Figure 3a, it is apparent
that SPEs did not undergo thermal decomposition until about 100 °C,
suggesting that the upper limit temperature for the SPEs is 100 °C.
This enhanced thermal stability of SPE compared to the liquid carbonate
electrolytes is especially useful for the safety of operation of the
LIBs.

Figure 3 (a) TGA traces of SPE, CSPE, porous sPS, and all of the individual
components of CSPE membrane. (b) Comparison of SPE with CSPE and their
derivative weight vs temperature plots.

From the data presented in Figure 3b, the first weight loss for SPE and CSPE is calculated
to be approximately 40%, attributed to the loss of succinonitrile
(Figure 3a) via sublimation
close to 100 °C. The second and third weight loss events are,
respectively, due to decomposition of PEGDA and the Li salt, as previously
reported.24 The TGA trace for CSPE is similar
to that of neat SPE up to the second weight loss event because of
the degradation of PEGDA. The third peak in derivative weight loss
versus temperature data in Figure 3b is shifted to higher temperature, to around 450 °C
attributed to the higher thermal stability of sPS chains compared
to the Li salt.

It is important to determine the amorphous and
crystalline polymer
content in CSPE. Specifically, it is important to assess the effect
of sPS strands on the crystallinity of components in SPE formulation.
For this purpose, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms
presented in Figure 4 are discussed. Note that SPE and CSPE specimens were dried in a
vacuum oven to eliminate the amounts of water absorbed during sample
fabrication. An inhomogeneous SPE formulation can produce regions
of crystalline areas, resulting in spikes and peaks in the DSC traces.
It is clearly seen in Figure 4 that DSC traces of neat SPE and CSPE are devoid of sharp
peaks, indicating that both of these materials were amorphous in nature.
A melting peak at 17 °C is observed for neat PEGDA. Succinonitrile
shows sharp peaks for single plastic phase transformations at −35
and 58 °C, as reported by Alarco et al.18 The absence of peaks due to succinonitrile or PEGDA in neat SPE
or CSPE indicates the amorphous nature of the fabricated membranes.
The high amorphous content of CSPE, as revealed by the DSC traces,
indicates reduced barrier between different phases and promises high
ionic conductivity values.

Figure 4 DSC thermograms for SPE, CSPE, and succinonitrile,
porous sPS,
and PEGDA.

The DSC data showed two broad
amorphous peaks for CSPE. The absence
of crystallinity in CSPE was confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD)
data, as presented in Figure 5. It is evident after comparing XRD patterns of SPE and CSPE
that the incorporation of SPE in the pores of sPS did not alter the
crystallinity of SPE; the two broad peaks observed in Figure 5 are attributed to amorphous
domains of CSPE. Note that succinonitrile shows sharp crystalline
2θ peaks at ∼20° and ∼29°, whereas the
peaks for crystalline PEO domains appear at ∼19° and 24°.29−31 The broad peak at around 20° is because of the cross-linked
PEGDA.32 The δ-form of sPS crystals
are characterized by a peak at 2θ = 8.3°,33 as shown in the traces of CSPE. The source of the peak
for SPE at 2θ between 5° and 10° cannot be confirmed.
The XRD data in conjunction with DSC thermograms discussed earlier
confirm that SPE domains remained amorphous in CSPE membranes, and
the confinement in sPS matrix had no effect on SPE crystallinity.
It is anticipated that the amorphous phase of SPE in CSPE would help
achieve higher ionic conductivity.34

of SPE, CSPE, and cross-linked PEGDA.

As alluded to the earlier discussion, the mechanical strength is
of prime importance for the successful implementation of CSPE membranes
in flexible energy storage devices. The optical images in Figure 2 revealed that CSPE
membranes were flexible and withstood several bending configurations. Figure 6 compares the stress
versus strain data of neat SPE and CSPE membranes. It is apparent
that the yield strength of CSPE membranes (∼1.8 MPa) is almost
6 times that of neat SPE membranes (0.3 MPa). In addition, the tensile
strength of ∼2 MPa and the tensile strain at break of 35% are
true reflections of the structural integrity of CSPE membranes at
large strains, contributed by the sPS networks. Neat SPE shows plastic
flow after the yield point, followed by necking, whereas CSPE shows
stress hardening above the yield point.

Figure 6 Stress vs strain data
for SPE and CSPE.

The presence of sPS networks
also augmented the storage modulus
values in CSPE, as presented in Figure 7. The storage modulus of CSPE is seen to be higher
than that of SPE at all temperatures, with the glassy state storage
modulus approaching 1500 MPa. The drop in storage modulus values with
temperature is more precipitous for SPE, for example, because of glass
transition, whereas the sPS network provided rigidity to CSPE membranes
and the corresponding storage modulus values of CSPE range between
a factor 5–10 times that of SPE at temperatures between −20
and 80 °C. In the case of CSPE, an additional drop in storage
modulus occurred at a temperature ∼90 °C because of the
glass transition of sPS chains. The values of Tg of SPE and CSPE can be inferred from the peaks of tan δ
versus temperature curves in Figure 7. Neat SPE shows a Tg around
−45 °C due to cross-linked PEGDA, whereas CSPE shows two Tg peaks. The first peak appears at around −52
°C because of cross-linked PEGDA system, and the broad peak at
around 90 °C is because of the glass transition of sPS chains.
A reduction of Tg for the cross-linked
PEGDA phase from −45 °C for neat SPE to −52 °C
in CSPE can be attributed to lower cross-link density of PEGDA in
the CSPE system. As the sPS-phase is responsible for the mechanical
strength of CSPE membranes, a reduction of Tg by −7 °C may be beneficial in achieving higher
electrochemical performance in CSPE membranes.35

SPE and CSPE membranes and compressed sPS sheets.

The electrochemical stability of the membrane materials was evaluated
using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) data,
as presented in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. The symmetric peak between
−0.5 and 0.5 V is commonly accepted as a typical reversible
lithium plating/stripping behavior. The LSV data in Figure 8a for CSPE exhibit a much wider
electrochemical window compared to what is observed for general liquid
electrolytes and neat SPE (Figure 8b). The electrochemical window for SPE turned unstable
at ∼4.2 V because of SPE decomposition from ∼4.5 V onward.
For CSPE system, however, the film remained stable until ∼5
V and started decomposing at ∼5.3 V. From the CV data in Figure 9, the stability under
repeated scanning is inferred. The performance of CSPE was coherent
in line with what was shown in Figure 8, and the performance remained stable up to 5 V in
the first cycle. The data for second cycle do not show obvious redox/oxidation
peak, suggesting the stability of CSPE when subjected to repetition
of ramped voltage. LSV and CV data indicate that CSPE membranes are
stable for electrochemical operations up to 5 V without any side reactions,
and hence, such membranes will have the potential to be a candidate
for LIBs.

Impedance spectroscopy is a commonly
applied method for the evaluation
of electrical performance of SPEs. The ionic conductivity (σ)
at various temperatures is calculated using eq 1(36) 1  

In eq 1, l is the thickness, Rb is the bulk resistance,
and A is the area of SPE. The ionic conductivity
describes the movement of ions inside the film; such behavior can
be inferred from the data presented in Figure 10. At room temperature, the value of Rb was 230 Ω and the corresponding ionic
conductivity of CSPE membranes was 0.43 mS/cm; this value meets the
requirements for SPE. Ionic conductivity for neat SPE (LiTFSI/PEGDA/succinonitrile
wt ratio 35/25/40) was 0.72 mS/cm at 30 °C,21 indicating that CSPE was able to maintain the same order
of magnitude conductivity.

Figure 10 Nyquist plot for the conductivity of CSPE.

The battery testing results are shown in Figure 11. The initial specific
discharge capacity
can reach ∼140 mA h/g at a current density of 30 mA/g; the
Coulombic efficiency gradually increased and remained at 99.8% with
a slight fluctuation, suggesting a reversible charge and discharge
process without much loss of active materials. The specific capacity
at 40 cycles remains to be 114 mA h/g, and the average fading rate
from 2 to 40 cycles was only 0.5 mA h/g per cycle. The data in Figure 11 show that CSPE
membranes worked well with LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode in a solid-state
LIB.

Conclusions
The CSPE membranes exhibited
much higher thermal and electrochemical
stability while maintaining the ionic conductivity at the level of
SPE membranes. The DSC and XRD data confirmed the amorphous nature
of SPE in both SPE and CSPE membranes. This helped achieve the same
order of magnitude of ionic conductivity for CSPE and that of SPE.
Mechanical strength of CSPE was 6 times higher than that of neat SPE
because of the sPS networks that also contributed to the flexibility
of membrane materials. The higher mechanical properties and thermal
stability of sPS also allowed for a considerable electrochemical performance.
Compared to the PEGDA/LiTFSI/plasticizer system, which remained stable
until 4.7 V, the electrochemical window of CSPE was expanded to over
5 V. The ionic conductivity of CSPE can fulfill the requirements for
SPEs as it reached a value of 0.43 mS/cm. The fading rate of the all-solid-state
battery was less than 0.5 mA h/g per cycle, indicating that CSPE can
work effectively in solid-state LIBs.

Materials and Methods
sPS (Mw = 300 000 g/mol, density
= 1.05 g/mL) was purchased from Scientific Polymer Products Inc. (Ontario,
NY). Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and was
used as received. PEGDA (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) with a molecular weight
of 700 g mol–1, succinonitrile (C4N2H4 or SCN, Alfa Aesar, 99%), LiTFSI salt (Matrix
Scientific, Columbia, SC 99%), and photoinitiator bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphine
oxide (Irgacure 819, Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) were used without further
purification. Electrode materials including LFP (MTI Corp., Richmond,
CA), carbon black (Super P, MTI Corp., Richmond, CA), and poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) were placed in the oven at 80 °C
overnight to remove the residual moisture before use. Battery fabrication
components included an aluminum current collector, purchased from
MTI Corp., anhydrous 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Alfa Aesar, 99%), and
round punched lithium metal pieces (Li, MTI Corp.).

In a typical
SPE fabrication process, LiTFSI salt, polymer host
PEGDA, and succinonitrile plasticizer were kept and stored in an argon-filled
glovebox (O2 < 0.5 ppm, H2O < 0.5 ppm).
The desired weight ratio of the ternary mixture LiTFSI/PEGDA/succinonitrile
was 35/25/40. The mixture was vigorously stirred for half an hour
at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution; then, 2 wt %
of photoinitiator (Irgacure 819) based on PEGDA content was introduced
into the mixture, and the mixture was further stirred for another
5 min, allowing the photoinitiator to dissolve. Subsequently, the
mixture was poured into a mold with a glass cover on top to obtain
a smooth surface and a desired thickness. A UV light source with a
wavelength of 350 nm was exposed to the sample for 1 min to cure the
SPE film.

In preparation of CSPE films, sPS organogel was first
synthesized,
following a procedure outlined in the literature.27,28 For this purpose, 0.1 g/mL sPS pellets were dissolved in THF at
110 °C in a sealed vial. After complete dissolution of the pellets,
the hot solution was cast in the form of film or poured into a mold
to obtain monoliths. The THF phase of sPS organogel was later replaced
with the SPE solution containing LiTFSI/PEGDA/succinonitrile in a
weight ratio of 35/25/40 using a solvent exchange method. A similar
process was used earlier in developing high-temperature stable LIB
separators from macroporous sPS membranes filled with ionic liquids
and LiTFSI.37 A complete removal of THF
was confirmed from Fourier transform infrared spectra in the transmission
mode. The solvent exchange steps were carried out in a glovebox under
inert Ar environment.

Porous sPS organogels (films and monoliths)
were dried using supercritical
CO2 to obtain sPS aerogel.25,26 Supercritical
drying was performed at 50 °C and 1100 KPa, which are above the
critical point of CO2 (31 °C and 740 KPa).

Porosity
(P) of sPS aerogel specimens was estimated
from bulk density (ρb) and skeletal density (ρs) values, as in eq 2, whereas bulk density was obtained from mass and volume of
the specimens, as in eq 3. 2   3  

In eq 3, m is the mass of the sample, D is the diameter of
bulk sPS aerogel monoliths, and h is the height of
the monolith. Skeletal density was determined using helium pycnometer
(AccuPyc II 1340 Series, Micromeritics Instrument Corp GA, USA).

The porous morphology of the membrane was examined using a scanning
electron microscope (JEOL JSM5310) with an operating voltage of 5
kV. For this purpose, supercritically dried samples were fractured
at room temperature. The fractured specimen was mounted on an aluminum
stub using conductive carbon tape, and the stubs were sputter-coated
under Ar atmosphere using ISA 5400 sputter coater. The CSPE membranes
were examined using an optical microscope to determine the presence
of obvious unfilled pores.

The crystallinity of polymeric samples
was studied using XRD patterns
of neat SPE and CSPE obtained using Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer
equipped with HyPix 33000 detector and Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5604 Å). The tube voltage and current of 40 kV and 44 mA
were used. Data were collected continuously at a rate of 1°/min
from 2θ = 5° up to 35°.

DSC (TA Q200, TA Instruments,
New Castle, DE) technique was used
to study the thermal behavior of materials. The thermal properties,
such as melting temperature (Tm) and glass
transition temperature (Tg), were determined
at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min in a sealed hermetic pan under N2 purge flow of 50 mL/min. The thermal stability of samples
was investigated using TGA (Q50 TA Instruments) under nitrogen environment.
Approximately, 10 mg of the sample was placed in the platinum pan
and subjected to a heating rate of 10 °C under N2 flow
rate of 50 mL/min.

The tensile strengths of SPE and CSPE films
were measured in a
tension mode. The samples were prepared in dimensions of 0.6 mm ×
1 mm × 3 cm. An extension rate of 1 mm/min was used. Dynamic
mechanical properties were obtained using Q800 dynamic mechanical
analyzer (DMA) (TA Instruments, New Castle, Delaware). Initially,
a strain sweep experiment was performed at 1 Hz to examine the linear
viscoelastic regime. The temperature sweep experiments were performed
at 0.1% strain and 1 Hz frequency from −90 to 150 °C.
The loss tangent (tan δ) value of the CSPE was monitored as
a function of temperature to obtain Tg of the composite membrane specimens. For this purpose, specimens
were prepared in a mold of dimension of 0.6 mm × 1 mm ×
3 cm and subsequently cured by photo-cross-linking. Neat sPS aerogel
monolith specimens were compressed at 30 MPa pressure using a compression
molder to obtain flat film samples for DMA testing under tension mode.

Coin cell 2032 was fabricated using LFP as the cathode material
and Li foil as the anode. The composite LFP electrode with a mass
loading of 2–3 mg/cm2 was put into a mold. A mixture
of LiTFSI/PEGDA/succinonitrile in a weight ratio of 35/25/40 and photoinitiator
was added, and the mixture was exposed to UV light for the cross-linking
of the polymer. The Li foil was wetted by the electrolyte mixture
on one side, overlaid on the SPE/cathode system prepared above, and
the system was exposed to UV light again for curing of the polymer.

The electrochemical stability of the CSPE and the coin cell was
determined from LSV and CV using SS (stainless steel)/CSPE/Li block
cell on electrochemical workstation (CHI608E Electrochemical Analyzer,
CH Instruments). In LSV, the voltage was changed from 0 to 10 V at
a sweep rate of 0.5 mV/s. The same scan rate was applied to CV study
with a voltage range of −0.5–5 V.

Ionic conductivity
at room temperature was obtained from electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy test using electrochemical workstation (CHI608E
Electrochemical Analyzer, CH Instruments). The frequency range of
the test was changed from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 10
mV using a SS/PEM/SS cell. The temperature during measurement was
controlled by using an isothermal chamber with a large thermal mass.
The thickness of the films was controlled to 1 mm by using a mold.

The galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling test of the half-cells
was carried out within the range of 2.5–3.9 V. The current
density was 30 mA/g for the first 10 cycles; then, it was increased
to 50 mA/g for later cycles.
