Because
of excellent bioavailability and high biocompatibility,
solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have gained attention in recent years,
especially in drug delivery systems. SLNs are composed of a drug that
is loaded in a lipid matrix and stabilized by surfactants. In this
work, we have investigated the feasibility of the acoustic cavitation-assisted
hot melt mixing method for the formulation of SLNs using different
stabilizers. A lipid Compritol 888 ATO (CPT) and a poorly water-soluble
drug ketoprofen (KP) were used as a model lipid and drug, respectively.
Gelucire 50/13 (GEL), poloxamer 407 (POL), and Pluronic F-127 (PLU)
were used as the stabilizers. The effect of the stabilizers on the
physico-chemical properties of SLNs was thoroughly studied in this
work. The particle size and stability in water at different temperatures
were measured using a dynamic light scattering method. The spherical
shape (below 250 nm) and core–shell morphology were confirmed
by field-emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron
microscopy. The chemical, crystal, and thermal properties of SLNs
were studied by FTIR, XRD analysis, and DSC, respectively. SLNs prepared
using different stabilizers showed an encapsulation efficiency of
nearly 90% and a drug loading efficiency of 12%. SLNs showed more
than 90% of drug released in 72 h and increased with pH was confirmed
using in vitro drug release studies. SLNs were nontoxic to raw 264.7
cells. All stabilizers were found suitable for acoustic cavitation-assisted
SLN formulation with high encapsulation efficiency and drug loading
and good biocompatibility.

1 Introduction
The
synthesis of new drug molecules has become progressive with
the advancement of computer-aided design tools.1 The poor solubility of nearly 40% of drug molecules is
the major reason for the failure in the main stream.2,3 Based on the biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS), poorly
water-soluble drugs have either class II or IV active pharmaceutical
ingredients (APIs).4 There are several
approaches such as particle size reduction,5,6 crystal
engineering,7 traditional colloidal carrier
system formulations,8 polymeric nanoparticles,9 and lipid-based nanoparticles to improve the
bioavailability of BCS class II and IV drugs.10 Among the several nanocarriers, polymeric/lipid nanoparticles are
the classic nanocarriers. However, polymeric nanoparticles have cytotoxicity
compared to lipids. Various lipid-based formulations are commercialized
or are at various phases of clinical studies.11,12

Lipid-based nanoparticles for drug delivery are a promising
approach
among many nanotechnology-based drug carrier systems.13 Briefly, lipid-based nanocarriers are classified as liposomes,
self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, solid lipid nanoparticles
(SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers.14 Liposomes have a short shelf-life, poor colloidal stability, and
high cost. In 1991, a new nanocarrier system, namely, SLNs, was introduced
to overcome the disadvantages associated with liposomes.15 The major advantages of SLNs are high biocompatibility,
stability, nontoxicity, and feasibility of controlled release of drug
for targeted delivery, and these properties make them a promising
candidate over other nanocarrier systems.16 Speiser and coworkers formulated SLNs through a spray-drying technique
in the 80’s.17 Quick progress has
been made and many formulations are commercialized and available in
the market now.15,18 SLNs are composed of a solid
lipid matrix loaded with drugs and stabilized with nontoxic surfactants.
SLNs are able to carry lipophilic as well as hydrophilic drugs. In
the last 30 years, various approaches have been developed for the
preparation of SLNs such as micro/nanoemulsions, high pressure homogenization,
and carbon dioxide as a supercritical solvent.19 The micro/nanoemulsion method is one of the facile methods
for the preparation of SLNs. The hydrophobic drug containing oil droplets
that are stabilized by using isotopically and kinetically stable emulsifier
thin layers make nanoemulsions.20 Nanoemulsions
are widely used for several applications, including drug delivery,
and it is important to control their physicochemical properties.20 The in vitro performance of nanoemulsions depends
on the droplet size. Nanoemulsions can be prepared using ultrasound
waves. This method is quite efficient and provides energy locally
through cavitation.21,22 This energy helps in processing
nanomaterials and in the preparation of SLNs.

The combination
of lipids and stabilizers play a crucial role in
the formation of SLNs. These also affect the size/shape of the particles,
entrapment efficiency, drug loading, stability, and the drug release
profile.23 In the present study, we have
prepared the nanoemulsions using ultrasonication. The acoustic cavitation-assisted
hot melt mixing method is used to prepare SLNs with a high entrapment
and drug loading efficiency. We have selected Compritol as a model
lipid for encapsulating ketoprofen (KP) based on the solubility or
miscibility of KP in molten lipid. KP was used as the model drug in
this investigation. Stabilizers also play a crucial role in SLN formulations.
In the process of SLN preparation, the stabilizer is typically dispersed
in molten lipid. Stabilizers are broadly classified as three types—ionic,
nonionic, and amphoteric. The advantages of nonionic stabilizers over
ionic stabilizers are low toxicity, less irritation to the gastrointestinal
track, and prevention of lipid degradation in vivo.24 Nonionic stabilizers Gelucire (GEL), Poloxamer 407 (POL),
and Pluronic F-127 (PLU) are used in this study.25 Gelucire is a water-dispersible stabilizer for lipid-based
formulations which is used to enhance the oral bioavailability of
poor water-soluble APIs.26 Gelucire forms
microemulsions in aqueous media by self-emulsification. Poloxamer
and pluronic are tri-block copolymers with the same chain length and
contains polypropylene oxide and polyethylene oxide, with trade names
of CAS (9003-11-6) and MDL number (MFCD00082049), respectively.27

The main objective of this study is to
investigate the feasibility
of the acoustic cavitation-assisted hot melt mixing method for the
formulation of SLNs with high encapsulation efficiency and drug loading
using different stabilizers but not limited to KP-loaded Compritol
nanoparticles. The effect of experimental parameters such as concentrations
of lipid, stabilizers, and drug, and the effect of different stabilizers
on the physicochemical properties and performance of SLNs such as
cytotoxicity against raw 264.7 cell line, drug-release behavior of
the formulated drug-loaded SLNs were studied in the present work.

2 Results and Discussion
This work focuses on the formulation
of SLNs through the acoustic
cavitation-assisted hot melt mixing method using different stabilizers,
and the investigation of the effect of different stabilizers and other
experimental parameters on the physicochemical properties of SLNs.
The choice of lipid as a drug-delivery carrier depends on drug solubility
or miscibility in the lipid.17,19 Based on the solubility
studies of KP in different lipids, we chose Compritol as the lipid
carrier and KP as a model drug. To the hot melt mixture of Compritol,
KP, and stabilizers, quick addition of water under stirring led to
pre-emulsion formation. Stabilizers stabilize the lipid droplets.
After probe sonication for 15 min at 90 °C, the lipid droplets
were broken down, resulting in the formation of nanoemulsions. Cooling
the nanoemulsion below the melting point of lipid led to the precipitation
of the lipid droplets and thereby forming SLNs.

2.1 Effect
of the Lipid to Stabilizer Ratio
It is interesting to understand
the effect of experimental parameters
to prepare the SLNs with excellent encapsulation efficiency, drug
loading, and a smaller particle size. Hence, we investigated the effect
of parameters such as the ratio of lipid to stabilizers and the effect
of different stabilizers and concentration of the drug on SLNs. The
other experimental conditions affecting the particle size and shape
of SLNs such as sonication, water volume, and temperature were optimized
in our previous study and the same were used here.28 We initially investigated the effect of the lipid to stabilizer
ratio on SLNs, and Table 1 depicts the corresponding results—particle size, polydispersity
index, and zeta potential. To study the effect of the lipid to stabilizer
ratio, we prepared SLNs by varying the lipid to stabilizer ratio from
4:1 to 1:1. A fixed amount of lipid, 400 mg, was used. The stabilizer
amount was increased by 50 mg per increment, which ranged from 100
to 400 mg. It is clear from Table 1 that the prepared SLN particle size decreased with
the increase of the stabilizer concentration. The similar trend was
observed for all the SLNs prepared using stabilizers—GEL, POL,
and PLU. The SLN particle size decreased from 765 ± 61, 811 ±
45, and 856 ± 65 to 452 ± 33, 369 ± 31, and 421 ±
39 nm, respectively, for CPT–GEL, CPT–POL, and CPT–PLU,
when the lipid to stabilizer ratio was changed from 4:1 to 1:1. Due
to the decrease in the particle size, the surface area was enhanced
in a short time during sonication. Therefore, the kinetic aspects
must be considered.23 The number of stabilizer
molecules increased as the ratio of lipid to stabilizer decreased
and hence, the new surface generated during sonication by the reduction
in particle size can be stabilized by a greater number of stabilizer
molecules. However, it is widely suggested to use the minimum concentration
of stabilizers in drug-delivery formulations, because cytotoxicity
increases with increasing stabilizer concentration.29 So, an optimum lipid to stabilizer ratio has been used
for further experiments. The ratios 8:5, 2:1, and 2:1 were optimum
for lipid to stabilizer combinations for GEL, POL, and PLU, respectively.
Above the optimum ratios, the further decrease in the particle size
was not observed even after increasing the stabilizer concentration
to 400 mg. The particle size of SLNs at optimum lipid to stabilizer
ratios were 489 ± 39, 424 ± 41, and 461 ± 58 nm, respectively,
for CPT–GEL, CPT–POL, and CPT–PLU. CPT–GEL,
CPT–POL, and CPT–PLU are used throughout for bare SLNs.
CPT–GEL denotes the bare SLNs of Compritol prepared using the
stabilizer Gelucire.

2.2 Effect
of Drug Concentration
To understand
the effect of drug concentration on the particle size, SLNs loaded
with different concentrations of the drug KP were prepared using different
stabilizers—GEL, POL, and PLU at their optimum concentrations.
The corresponding results are presented in Table 2. For all the formulations, an increase in
the particle size with the increase of the drug concentration was
observed. The maximum drug concentration was limited by the solubility
or miscibility of KP in CPT. KP solubility or miscibility concentration
in CPT was 25% (w/w). The drug loaded SLNs were further characterized
to investigate the physicochemical properties, entrapment efficiency,
drug loading, in vitro drug-release behavior, and cytotoxicity.

2.3 Zeta Potential
The electrical charge
on the surface of the prepared SLNs was studied using zeta potential
measurements. The corresponding zeta potential results are presented
in Tables 1 and 2 for all prepared samples—drug-loaded and
bare SLNs. From Table 1, it was observed that the zeta potential of SLNs without the drug
was correlated with the particle size. The zeta potential tends to
be in the negative range for larger particle sizes. The zeta potential
of bare SLNs varied from −36.6 ± 9.2 to −19.4 ±
7.1, −33.9 ± 6.2 to −18.9 ± 4.2, and −31.3
± 8.1 to −19.4 ± 4.9 mV for CPT–GEL, CPT–POL,
and CPT–PLU, respectively, at different stabilizer concentrations.
This can be due to several reasons and have been widely reported.30,31 This can be explained by the absorption of enough number of stabilizer
molecules on the surface of the lipid matrix. The zeta potential also
depends on the types of stabilizers, interaction between stabilizers,
and the lipid matrix, which also depends on the available functional
group, concentration of stabilizers, and physicochemical properties
of stabilizers in water or aqueous colloidal dispersion. Above the
optimum concentration of the stabilizer, change in the zeta potential
was negligible. The zeta potential also reflects the stability of
nanoparticles. In the case of drug-loaded SLNs (−20 to −25
mV), there was almost no variation in the zeta potential compared
to the respective bare SLNs, indicating that no drug molecules were
present on the SLN surface and there was no change in the surface
composition of the SLNs even when the drug was loaded. All the prepared
SLNs at optimum conditions, without drug and with drug, fall in the
acceptable range and indicated the good stability of the prepared
SLNs.32−34

2.4 Stability in Water at Different
Temperatures
Sample stability in water at different temperature
was measured
using the DLS technique. The temperature of the sample chamber was
tuned from 20° to 80 °C with 5 °C increment and the
particle size of SLNs was monitored. The corresponding particle size
at different temperatures are presented in Figure 1. There was no change in the size of the
particles upto 50 °C for bare and drug-loaded SLNs prepared using
the stabilizers GEL, POL, and PLU. The slight decrease in the particle
size at 55 °C resulted from the melting of stabilizers from the
surface of the lipid matrix. The stabilizers GEL, POL, and PLU has
melting points at 46°–51°, 55°, and 53°–57
°C, respectively. Due to very close melting temperature of stabilizers,
all SLNs showed similar stability in water at different temperatures.
However, above 55 °C, a significant decrease in the particle
size was observed. The significant decrease in the particle size beyond
55 °C was due to the melting of the Compritol matrix. At 80 °C,
a complete disappearance of the particles was observed. Hence, it
is concluded that SLNs are therefore stable up to 50 °C in water.
The change in the stability of SLNs in water may be due to the change
in microviscosity of dispersion with temperature. It is well known
that microviscosity of colloidal dispersion is temperature-dependent.
Microviscosity decreases with the increase in temperature and hence
leads to destabilization.35

temperature as measured using DLS.

2.5 Morphology
Imaging techniques such
as field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to study the particle size
and shape of SLNs (Figures 2 and 3). From Figure 2, it is evident that the formulated SLNs
were spherical in shape. The average particle size measured from the
FESEM images were 189 ± 41, 171 ± 36, 194 ± 51, 243
± 46, 215 ± 32, and 231 ± 53 nm, respectively, for
CPT–GEL, CPT–POL, CPT–PLU, KP@CPT–GEL,
KP@CPT–POL, and KP@CPT–PLU. In the absence of drug,
the particle size of SLNs was lower than the drug-loaded SLNs. A similar
trend was observed for all SLNs prepared in presence of different
stabilizers. The core–shell morphology of SLNs was confirmed
by the TEM images (Figure 3). The dark core of the lipid and light corona of the stabilizer
were observed in the TEM images of SLNs. The particle size (z-average, d/nm) measured using DLS was found to be higher
than the particle size calculated from the FESEM images. This is may
be due to several reasons. First, DLS gives the hydrodynamic diameter
of particles. The hydrodynamic diameter is always larger than the
accurate particle size. Second, DLS gives a larger z-average value in the presence of a small fraction of larger particle
sizes. DLS cannot differentiate between individual and aggregated
particles. Hence, the z-average particle size in
DLS is higher.36 FESEM is a more reliable
method for direct viewing and to estimate the particle size. Using
several FESEM images of samples, we have estimated the average particle
size.37 The sample preparation method of
FESEM and TEM are also different; on a TEM grid, the particle population
remains low as compared to that in FESEM. In FESEM, all particles
of the dropped aqueous suspension of the sample normally settle down
on a silica wafer. In TEM, the relatively bigger particles settle
on the grid due to the washing cycle after phosphotungstic acid (PTA)
deposition. A similar trend of result has been reported in the literature.38,39Figure 4 represents
the particle sizes measured using the DLS and FESEM images of SLNs
under different experimental conditions.

2.6 Crystal
Nature by XRD Analysis
To
study the crystal nature of the samples, powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) technique was used. XRD analysis was performed for all the prepared
SLNs along with all the raw materials such as lipid, drug, and stabilizers.
XRD patterns of all samples are presented in Figure 5. The characteristic peaks of all the materials
such as CPT, KP, GEL, POL, and PLU were matched well with the literature
reports.28,40−42 Major characteristic
peaks of the lipid were at 2θ—21.2° and 23.3°.
All the stabilizers showed two characteristic diffraction peaks. The
stabilizer GEL showed peaks at 2θ(degree), 19.2° and 23.3°;
POL showed peaks at 2θ(degree), 19.1° and 23.2°; and
PLU showed peaks at 2θ(degree), 19.2° and 23.3°. The
all bare SLNs prepared using different stabilizers showed three characteristic
XRD peaks at 2θ(degree)—19.1°, 21.2°, and 23.3°,
respectively. XRD patterns of drug-loaded SLNs were similar to the
corresponding bare SLNs. In drug-loaded SLN diffraction patterns,
the XRD peaks at 2θ(degree) 23.3° correspond to lipid,
peaks at 2θ(degree) 19.1° correspond to stabilizers, and
peaks at 2θ(degree) 21.2° are overlapped characteristic
peaks of stabilizers and pure lipid. The XRD pattern of all formulated
SLNs showed prominent peaks of the pure lipid and corresponding stabilizers.
Interestingly, the peaks corresponding to the pure drug were completely
absent in all the drug-loaded SLNs, Hence, it was further confirmed
that the drug was present in its molecular form in the lipid matrix.

bare and drug-loaded SLNs.

2.7 FTIR Spectroscopy
The Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to investigate the chemical
nature of the lipid, drug, and stabilizers before and after SLN formulations.
The characteristic peak of the pure lipid, stabilizers and formulated
SLNs are shown in Figure 6. The characteristic peaks of the lipid, drug, and all the
three stabilizers matched well with the literature reports.28,40−42 The peaks at 2958, 2913, and 2958 cm–1 correspond to the pure lipid. These characteristic peaks of the
pure lipid were also observed in bare SLNs as well as in drug-loaded
SLNs. Interestingly, the characteristic peaks corresponding to the
drug was absent in all drug-loaded SLNs, further confirming the absence
of the drug on the surface of SLNs. Thus, it was clear that the drug
was molecularly dispersed in the lipid matrix.

the raw ingredients and (b) the formulated
bare and drug-loaded SLNs.

2.8 Thermal Characterization
Thermal
response of the prepared SLNs was investigated using differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The corresponding thermal curves
and data are presented in Figure 7 and Table 3 respectively. The melting points of the lipid CPT, drug KP,
and stabilizers GEL, POL, and PLU were observed as endothermic peaks
at 73.8°, 96.0°, 50.6°, 59.5°, and 59.8 °C,
respectively. The melting points of all the raw excipients were found
to be similar as reported in the literature.28,40−42 All the stabilizers’ melting points were lower
than CPT and KP. SLNs were showed two endothermic peaks, the major
peak corresponding to melting of the lipid and the minor peak corresponding
to melting of stabilizers. The thermal response of SLNs showed the
initial melting of the stabilizer and complete melting of the lipid
matrix. The minor peak of the stabilizer is due to the presence of
the stabilizer with an optimum concentration, which is much lower
compared to that of the lipid and drug in the prepared SLNs. The major
peak of the bare and drug-loaded SLNs prepared using different stabilizers
were observed as endothermic peaks between 73° and 77 °C.
The bare SLNs melting point was higher than the corresponding SLNs
loaded with KP. The CPT–GEL and KP@CPT–GEL showed a
melting point at 74.3 and 73.7 °C, respectively. Similarly, CPT–POL,
KP@CPT–POL, CPT–PLU, and KP@CPT–PLU showed melting
points at 76.8°, 73.9°, 75.8°, and 74.5 °C. This
was due to the change in the entropy of the mixture. The decrease
in the melting point of SLNs after drug loading may be due to the
decrease in the crystallinity of samples. The lipid melting point
decreased due to change in the particle size to a nanoscale upon SLN
formulation. Similar observations were reported in the literature
including our previous study.39,43 The absence of melting
points corresponding to the drug in drug-loaded SLNs further confirmed
the molecular dispersion of the drug in the lipid matrix. Moreover,
the drug retained good solubility in the molten lipid.

2.9 Percentage
of Encapsulation Efficiency (%
EE) and Drug Loading (%DL)
Through serial dilution of the
drug solution in ethanol, the absorbance was measured using a UV–visible
spectrophotometer. The calibration curve was registered using concentration
versus absorbance data. The drug-loaded SLNs were selectively dissolved
in ethanol and based on the absorbance of the drug molecules in ethanol,
%EE and %DL were calculated. The %EE of KP was observed to be 91,
87, and 89% in the drug-loaded SLNs prepared using GEL, POL, and PLU,
respectively. The %DL for the KP-loaded SLNs prepared using stabilizers
GEL, POL, and PLU was 12.13, 12.42 and 12.71%, respectively. It was
concluded that all the three stabilizers were suitable for the preparation
of Compritol nanoparticles with high drug entrapment efficiency and
drug loading. The %EE and %DL were further compared with the literature
reports. The SLNs composed of CPT and/or KP reported in the literature
are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). From Table S1, it is clear that most
of the formulations (entry 1 to 12) were with %EE lower than 90%.
The entries 13, 17, and 18 showed 92, 98, and 99% of %EE. However,
the particle size of SLNs were in the micron range (∼2 to 790
μm). The entries 14 to 16 were having a smaller particle size
with good %EE and %DL. It was confirmed that the CPT and KP combination
using different stabilizers and the acoustic cavitation-assisted hot
melt mixing process would be suitable for the formation of SLNs with
good %EE and %DL.

2.10 In Vitro Drug Release
Profile
The
KP release profile from the drug-loaded SLNs was studied using the
dissolution method under perfect sink conditions for 72 h in a phosphate
buffered saline (pH 4.0, 7.4, and 10.0) medium at 37 ± 1 °C
as shown in Figure 8. The release of drug up to 72 h is due to the molecular dispersion
of the drug into the lipid matrix. This can be due to uniform distribution
efficiency of acoustic cavitation, which may favor the formation of
SLNs with the drug dispersed homogeneously throughout the lipid matrix.
It is also widely reported that such types of SLNs take a longer time
for delivery of the drug. The drug release percentage also depends
on several other parameters, which cannot be ignored such as physicochemical
properties of lipids, stabilizers, drugs, and their concentration,
experimental parameters, and drug-release conditions. Almost 100%
of the drug was released at the end of 72 h at pH 7.4 and 10.0. The
drug release % increased with pH of the release media. The drug release
percentage for the formulations of the drug-loaded SLNs prepared using
stabilizers GEL, POL, and PLU were 92, 94, and 95%, respectively.
CPT and all the three stabilizers were suitable combination for the
delivery of KP under optimum conditions. It could be a good system
for the drug delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. From the in vitro
drug release behavior, it was clear that the acoustic cavitation-assisted
formulated SLNs are suitable for drug delivery. There was no effect
of the stabilizers used in the formulation on the drug release profile.
Hence, this technique could be a feasible method for the formulation
of SLNs for drug delivery application.

Figure 8 In vitro drug release
profile of the formulated KP-loaded SLNs
[(a) KP@CPT–GEL; (b) KP@CPT–POL, and (c) KPT@CPT-PLU]
at different pH.

In the matrix system
such as SLNs, the drug could be present in
dissolved or dispersed form, thereby modulating the drug-release profile.
The nonlinearity of the drug-release profile is shown in Figure 8. Drug-release kinetics
was studied by fitting in vitro drug release data into the zero order
and first order kinetics, Higuchi model, Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetic
model, and Hixson–Crowell model. The linear correlation coefficient
(R2) for drug-loaded SLNs at different
pH are reported in Table S2 (Supporting Information). From Table S2, it is clear that the
drug-release kinetics depends on pH. On increasing the pH value the
drug-release kinetics follows zero and first order kinetics. At pH
10.0, KP@CPT–GEL and KP@CPT–PLU follow zero order kinetics
whereas KP@CPT–POL follows the Hixson–Crowell kinetics.
The drug release behavior of the formulated SLNs is closely similar
at pH 7.4. However, very poor drug release was observed at pH 4.0.
The linear correlation coefficient (R2) was close to 1.0 indicating that the release followed the respective
kinetic model.

2.11 In Vitro Cytotoxicity
The PrestoBlue
cell viability assay was used to investigate the cytotoxicity. The
cytotoxicity in raw 264.7 cells was tested for all SLNs along with
CPT, KP, GEL, POL, and PLU. The cells were treated for 72 h with a
concentration range of SLNs from 30 to 120 μg/mL. The corresponding
results are represented in Figure 9. CPT and KP were nontoxic even at a concentration
of 120 μg/mL, proving excellent biocompatibility of the lipid
and drug against the raw 264.7 cells. However, some toxicity has been
observed for stabilizers. The order of cell viability of stabilizers
after 72 h treatment (120 μg/mL) was GEL (∼40%) >
POL
(∼80%) ≈ PLU (∼80%). The toxic behavior of GEL
has been previously reported by Sachs-Barrable et al.,44 and our result was in concordance with their
report. POL, PLU, and CPT showed approximately 20, 20 and 10% cell
death, respectively, at the higher concentration studied. KP showed
cell proliferation activity which was evident by an increase in the
cell viability to approximately 140%. On the other hand, among the
formulated SLNs, only GEL-based formulation showed nearly 40% cytotoxicity
at the higher concentration studied. The reason being the concentration
of GEL (250 mg) is comparatively higher than that of POL (200 mg)
and PLU (200 mg) in the respective SLN formulation. The stabilizers
are usually toxic and hence, an optimum concentration is preferred
to use in the formulations. Interestingly, the drug-loaded GEL-based
formulation showed lesser toxicity when compared to pure GEL and bare
SLNs. This can be explained on the basis of the surface behavior of
pure GEL, bare SLNs, and drug-loaded GEL-based formulation. The toxicity
of pure GEL and bare SLNs indicated the influence of the surface behavior
of stabilizers, which was probably suppressed in drug-loaded GEL-based
formulation due to the presence of drug. The exciting cytotoxicity
results suggest that the use of nontoxic stabilizers with an optimum
lipid to stabilizer ratio would be suitable for SLN formulation without
toxicity.44 Further in vivo studies need
to be carried out to investigate clinical application for effective
therapy.

3 Conclusions
KP-loaded SLNs stabilized with
Gelucire, Poloxamer, and Pluronic
were prepared successfully using acoustic cavitation-assisted hot
melt mixing method. The formulated SLNs had a particle size below
250 nm and core–shell type morphology. A decrease in particle
size with the increase of stabilizer concentration was observed. The
ratios 8:5, 2:1, and 2:1 were found optimum lipid to stabilizers GEL,
POL, and PLU, respectively. As the concentration of drug increased,
particle size of drug-loaded SLNs increased. The prepared SLNs showed
good stability in water upto 50 °C. The drug was molecularly
dispersed in the core of the lipid matrix and stabilized by a monolayer
of the stabilizer as a shell. The prepared drug-loaded SLNs showed
high encapsulation efficiency (91, 87, and 89%) and drug loading (12.13,
12.42, and 12.71%) percentage; the stabilizers GEL, POL, and PLU were
used in formulations. The formulated SLNs showed good biocompatibility
against raw 264.7 cells even after 72 h of treatment and 100% drug
was released at end of 72 h. The developed acoustic cavitation-assisted
hot melt mixing method is a feasible technique for the formulation
of SLNs with high encapsulation efficiency, drug loading, and excellent
biocompatibility using different stabilizers with optimum concentration.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Lipid
(Compritol 888 ATO)
(Compritol or CPT) and Poloxamer 407 (Poloxamer or POL) (product no.
16758), Pluronic 127 (Pluronic or PLU) (product no. P2443), KP, and
PTA were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industries, Japan and Sigma
Aldrich, India, respectively. Gattefosse, France gifted Gelucire 50/13
(Gelucire or GEL). All solvents and silica wafers were obtained from
Merck and ICON analytical, respectively. Elga PURELAB option-R7 purified
water was used throughout. Sonication was performed using a Horn Probe
Sonicator Sonics VCX-750 Vibra Cell Ultrasonic processor, 750 Watt
and 20 KHz, Sonics and Materials, Inc., USA. All filters used were
obtained from Millipore. The abbreviations of all the chemicals mentioned
in parenthesis are used throughout.

4.2 Preparation
of SLNs
A hot melt homogenization
followed by sonication method was employed to prepare SLNs.28 The simple experimental setup of the process
is presented in Scheme 1. Briefly, Compritol and stabilizer, in the ratio 8:5 was taken in
a round bottom flask. The flask was heated in a water bath to 90 °C
to form a homogenous clear solution. Then 20 mL of hot water (90 °C)
was slowly added to the hot homogenous mixture. Stirring was continued
for few minutes to obtain pre-emulsion. The pre-emulsion solution
was sonicated to obtain a nanoemulsion. The hot nanoemulsion was slowly
cooled to 4 °C and stored for 24 h at the same temperature (4
°C). The SLNs was collected by centrifuge then washed with water
and dried at 40 °C. SLNs of Compritol were prepared using three
different stabilizers, namely—Gelucire, poloxamer, and pluronic.
Along with lipid and stabilizers, at an optimum ratio, the drug was
added during the preparation of the hot homogenous mixture to obtain
drug-loaded SLNs. By varying the concentrations of stabilizers and
drug, a series of samples were prepared. Repeating all the experiments
at least three times checked the reproducibility. Throughout the article,
bare SLNs are abbreviated as CPT–GEL, CPT–POL, and CPT–PLU
and drug-loaded SLNs are abbreviated as KP@CPT–GEL, KP@CPT–POL,
and KP@CPT–PLU.

4.3 Hydrodynamic Diameter, Polydispersity Index,
Zeta Potential and Stability in Water
The dynamic light scattering
(DLS) (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern instrument Ltd., UK) instrument
containing 633 nm 4 mW He–Ne laser, incorporated noninvasive
backscatter optics with a detection angle of 173° and a temperature
tunable sample chamber ranging from 20 to 90 °C was used for
primary characterization—particle size (d/nm), polydispersity
index, zeta potential and thermal stability—of the prepared
SLNs.45 A dilute aqueous suspension was
prepared to measure the particle size, zeta potential, PDI, and thermal
stability through dispersing 20 μL of the as-formulated SLN
suspension into 3 mL of ultrapure double-distilled water. By tuning
the sample chamber temperature from 20 to 80 °C, particle sizes
were measured to study the stability of SLNs in water at different
temperatures.

4.4 Particle Size and Shape
The analytical
techniques such as FESEM (FEI, Nova NanoSEM 450 model) and TEM (HR-TEM,
FEI, Tecnai G2, S-Twin, at 200 KV) were used to confirm
the exact particle size and shape of the prepared SLNs. The similar
dilute suspension prepared for DLS measurements was used for FESEM
and TEM sample preparation. The sample was drop-coated on a clean
silica wafer, after drying for 48 h the silica wafers were subjected
to gold sputter coating at 20 mA for 2 nm thickness and thereafter
FESEM imaging was performed.46 Carbon-coated
copper TEM grids were used for TEM imaging. The prepared dilute suspension
of the sample was drop-coated on the TEM grid. PTA 2% (w/v) aqueous
suspension was used for staining.28 The
particle size from FESEM images was measured using ImageJ software.46

4.5 XRD, FTIR and DSC
Powder XRD [Smart
Lab X-ray Diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan), X-ray source: Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm)] patterns, Fourier-transform infrared
(FTIR) [PerkinElmer FTIR emission spectrometer (Spectrum Two)] spectroscopy
and thermal analysis (DSC Netzsch STA 449 F1 Jupiter instrument) techniques
were employed, respectively, to study the crystal, chemical, and thermal
properties of the prepared SLNs along with all the ingredients. Samples
were placed in a glass sample holder, suitable voltage (45 kV) and
current (100 mA) were applied, and XRD scanning was performed at the
2θ(Degree) range of 10° to 70° with a 2° per
min scan rate and 0.02° per second step size. FTIR spectroscopy
ranging from a frequency of 4000 to 600 cm –1 was
recorded for all samples with 4 cm –1 resolution
and 8 scans. Background correction was done using pure KBr pellets.
Thermal analysis of all samples (using 2–3 mg sample in a pin-hole
alumina crucible) was done under nitrogen flow (60 mL/min) by heating
to 300 °C from room temperature with a 5 °C/min heating
rate. The crucible without any sample was used as reference.47,48

4.6 Drug Encapsulation Efficiency, Drug Loading,
and in vitro Drug Release
    Above formulae were
used to calculate the
percentage of drug encapsulation efficiency (%EE) and drug loading
(%DL) of the prepared SLNs. The free drug-containing supernatant was
collected through dispersing the prepared SLNs in ethanol and centrifugation.
Through measuring the absorbance of the free drug using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer, %EE and %DL was calculated.49

Dissolution studies were conducted under perfect
sink conditions using a USP microprocessor dissolution test apparatus
(model 1912, Electronics India, India). The prepared drug-loaded SLNs
were placed in 900 mL PBS buffer (pH 4.0, 7.4 and 10.0) for 72 h at
37 ± 1 °C with 100 rpm. The absorbance of the released drug
was measured to calculate the drug release percentage by centrifugation
of the collected sample at different time points using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer.50 At each time point
equal amounts of the fresh medium was added. To study the drug release
kinetics, the in vitro drug release data was fitted to the zero order
and first order kinetics, Higuchi model, Korsmeyer-Peppas model, and
Hixson–Crowell model. The coefficient of determination (R2) and release exponents (n) were calculated from the plots.

4.7 Cell
Culture and Cytotoxicity Assay
RAW-264.7 macrophage cells
purchased from the National Centre for
Cell Sciences, Pune was used to study cytotoxicity. The cells were
grown in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco) and maintained at 37
°C in a CO2 (5%) incubator. The fresh medium was added
every two days and the cells were split once they reached 80% confluency.
The cytotoxicity of the sample was studied using the PrestoBlue assay.
A suspension of 1000 cells per well (in 1% FBS, 150 μL) were
seeded into a 96 well plate and after 24 h, and the adhered cells
were incubated with a concentration range of 30 to 120 μg/mL
of sample dispersion in PBS. The cells treated with samples were incubated
for 72 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Only cells and
only media were used as the positive and negative control, respectively.
After 72 h, 20 μL of the PrestoBlue cell viability reagent (Invitrogen,
Life technologies) was added to each well and further incubation was
carried out for 2 h in an incubator and thereafter fluorescence was
recorded (excitation 535 nm; emission 615 nm) using a Tecan Infinite
M200 PRO plate reader.
