In this study, we propose a convenient method for the
synthesis
of double-network gels by the one-shot radical polymerization for
their application to rapid optical tissue clearing. Double-network
gels were produced during the radical polymerization of acrylamide
(AAm) and sodium styrenesulfonate (SS) in the presence of N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide and
sodium divinylbenzenesulfonate as the cross-linkers by simultaneous
addition, that is, one-shot polymerization accompanying the delay
of polymerization for a second network monomer. We analyzed the polymerization
process based on the consumption rates of each monomer during the
reactions in the absence of the cross-linkers in order to estimate
the repeating unit structure of the resulting polymers. We then fabricated
the AAm/SS gels by the polymerization of AAm and SS in the presence
of the cross-linkers. We analyzed the swelling, viscoelastic, and
mechanical properties of the produced gels to investigate their network
structure. Finally, we demonstrated the validity of the double-network
gels for the application to rapid optical tissue clearing.

==== Body
Introduction
Polymer hydrogels with three-dimensional
(3D) network structures
are used as the key materials for the construction of smart materials
and systems, such as water absorbents,1 contact lenses,2 membranes for separation,3 drug delivery systems,4 shape-memory materials,5 self-healing
materials,6 actuators,7 cell scaffolds,8 tissue engineering,9 and so forth. Several approaches have been proposed
to design high-performance hydrogel materials, for example, interpenetrated
polymer networks,10 bio-responsible gels,11 slide-ring gels,12 tetra-PEG gels,13 nanocomposite gels,14 anisotropic gels,15 supramolecular hydrogels,16 and cyclodextrin-guest
interaction.17 Recently, double-network
gels have drawn much attention in various fields because of their
high mechanical strength and toughness.18−20 Typical high-strength
double-network gels contain two independent kinds of networks that
interact with each other in a space. The double-network gels with
a high mechanical strength are usually fabricated by a two-step polymerization
process. One component of the networks is highly cross-linked polyelectrolytes
(the first network) as the rigid skeleton, and the other component
is comprised of neutral polymers with a loose cross-linking structure
(the second network).20 It has been reported
that the produced double-network gels possess excellent tensile and
compression properties.21−30

Optical tissue clearing is an indispensable process for the
3D
imaging of tissues combined with a molecular-labeling technique, such
as immunofluorescence staining31 and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
staining,32 without preparing thin tissue
sections. A smart technique for optical tissue clearing using hydrogels
was developed in 2013 by Chung et al., named CLARITY (clear lipid-exchanged
acrylamide-hybridized rigid imaging/immuno-staining/in situ-hybridization-compatible
tissue-hydrogel),33 and several modified
methods have since been proposed.34−41 The CLARITY methods include several steps, such as the fixation
of proteins in polyacrylamide gels using paraformaldehyde (PFA), the
removal of lipids with a detergent-containing buffer, and adjustment
of the refractive index using refractive index matching solutions.
Ono et al. recently reported the application of polyelectrolyte hydrogels,
which were synthesized by the radical copolymerization of acrylamide
(AAm) and sodium 4styrenesulfonate (SS) in the presence of N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (bisAA),
to the optical tissue clearing method.42 The SS unit included in the hydrogel contributed to shortening an
optical tissue clearing process because of an electrostatic repulsion
and/or an increased osmotic pressure in the hydrogels. The tissues
became transparent more rapidly when they were embedded in the SS-containing
hydrogels.

When the hydrogels of AAm and SS were synthesized,
we noticed the
formation of gels with a complex structure because of a different
reactivity of these monomers during polymerization; that is, the copolymerization
did not simply provide a random copolymer. During a radical copolymerization
process using two kinds of monomers with significantly different reactivities,
a highly reactive monomer predominantly undergoes polymerization during
the initial stage of polymerization, in which only a small amount
of another monomer with a lower reactivity is incorporated into the
produced polymer. After almost total consumption of the reactive monomer
(the first monomer), the polymerization of the less-reactive monomer
(the second monomer) gradually occurs. It is also postulated that
bisAA as the cross-linker readily reacts with the propagating radical
produced from AAm, but it hardly adds to the SS propagating radical
with a highly conjugated structure. It was possible that the network
of SS as the first monomer was insufficiently grown because of the
lower reactivity of bisAA to the SS radical under the polymerization
conditions conducted in our previous study.42 The structure control of the network consisting of SS repeating
units as the electrolyte with an anionic charge is important for the
tissue clearing. Previously, Aranas et al. reported a simple one-step
radical polymerization procedure using potassium 3-sulfo-1-propyl
methacrylate and N-vinylpyrrolidone as the conjugating
and nonconjugating monomers, respectively, in the presence of the
two kind of corresponding cross-linkers for the synthesis of hydrogels.29 The produced double-network hydrogels were available
for rapid cell detachment.

In this study, we carried out the
one-shot polymerization of SS
and AAm using dual cross-linkers. First, the polymerization of AAm
and SS was carried out in the absence of cross-linkers in a buffer
or D2O and monitored the consumption of both monomers as
a function of the polymerization time using NMR spectroscopy. We analyzed
the monomer reactivity and the detailed reaction behaviors during
the one-shot polymerization. Next, we synthesized double-network hydrogels
by the radical polymerization of AAm and SS via a one-shot process
in the presence of dual cross-linkers, bisAA and sodium divinylbenzenesulfonate
(DVBS) (Figure 1).
We also discuss the effect of the combination of the monomers and
the cross-linkers with different reactivities on the network structures
and the properties of the produced hydrogels. The composition, swelling
behavior, viscoelastic, and mechanical properties of the obtained
hydrogels were investigated in detail. Finally, the produced double-network
hydrogels were applied to the rapid optical clearing of tumor tissues.

and DVBS), and radical initiators (VA-044 and APS) used in this study.

Results and Discussion
Polymerization Reactivity of AAm and SS
The polymerizations
of AAm or SS were carried in the presence of VA-044 in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) prepared using D2O (PBS–D2O) at 37 °C to compare the polymerization reactivity of these
monomers. As shown in the time–conversion relationship in Figure 2, the polymerization
of AAm rapidly proceeded and reached 95 and 99% conversions after
1 and 3 h, respectively, while the SS polymerized at a lower rate
and the conversion still increased even after 3 h.

Figure 2 Time–conversion
relationship for independent homopolymerizations
of AAm (red circle) and SS (blue square). The polymerizations were
carried out in the presence of VA-044 (7.0 mmol/L) in PBS–D2O at 37 °C. [AAm]0 = 0.50 mol/L, [SS]0 = 0.50 mol/L.

For the polymerization of AAm and SS by the simultaneous
addition
to the reaction system, that is, the one-shot polymerization of AAm
and SS, both monomers exhibited a polymerization reactivity that was
opposite to the order observed during the independent homopolymerizations.
In Figure 3, the time–conversion
relationships and their first-order plots are shown for the one-shot
polymerizations of AAm and SS with various monomer ratios in the feed.
The conversions of each monomer were simultaneously monitored as a
change in the intensities of the characteristic peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum. It clearly showed that SS was more rapidly
consumed than AAm during the polymerization (see Figure S1). The polymerization rate of SS was almost independent
of the presence or absence of AAm; that is, the conversion was over
90% after a 4 h polymerization, and then no SS was detected in the
reaction mixture after 8 h (Figure 3). The consumption rate of SS increased according to
an increase in the AAm content, but the magnitude of the change was
small. In contrast, the polymerization behavior of AAm sensitively
changed with or without SS. In the presence of SS, the consumption
of AAm was significantly suppressed. The conversion of AAm was less
than 20% after 4 h during the polymerization in the presence of an
equimolar amount of SS. This was quite different from the quantitative
consumption of AAm during homopolymerization under similar conditions
in the absence of SS. After the almost consumption of SS, the polymerization
of AAm was accelerated. During the one-shot polymerization of AAm
and SS, the composition of the remaining monomers continuously changed
according to the consumption rates of both monomers. This may lead
to the formation of polymers with heterogeneous structures after the
complete monomer consumption.

Figure 3 (a) Time–conversion relationships and
(b) first-order plots
for one-shot polymerization of AAm and SS with various feed compositions
in the presence of VA-044 (7.0 mmol/L) in PSB–D2O at 37 °C. [AAm]0/[SS]0 = 1/1 (circle),
3/1 (triangle), 6/1 (square), and 12/1 (rhombus) molar ratio in the
feed. The total monomer concentration was 0.50 mol/L.

In general, styrene monomers have a high reactivity
as the monomer
because of the highly stabilized structure of the corresponding propagating
radicals. Under the conditions of the coexistence of a highly conjugated
SS monomer and a relatively less-conjugated AAm monomer, the propagation
rate of SS was much greater prior to that of AAm. In fact, the monomer
reactivity ratios were reported to be r1 = 1.17 and r2 = 0.58 for the copolymerization
of styrene (M1) and AAm (M2) in the literature.43 The SS monomer is one of typical conjugating
monomers, for example, r1 = 7.19 and r2 = 0.084 for the copolymerization of SS (M1) and N-vinylpyrrolidone (M2).44 These literature values also supported the predominant
propagation of SS and the lower reactivity of AAm during the copolymerization.
Based on the monomer consumption rates in Figure 3, the comonomer–copolymer composition
curve was depicted, and the monomer reactivity ratios were estimated
to be r1 = 0.10 and r2 = 6.6 using the Fineman–Ross plots (Figures S2 and S3), where M1 and M2 monomers are AAm and SS, respectively. These parameters indicated
that SS possesses a reactivity more than 60 times higher than that
of AAm. With the increase in the AAm content in the feed, a time lag
between the consumption of both monomers was shortened, and the polymerization
behavior became close to the typical copolymerization.

Preparation of the Hydrogels
The polymerization was
carried out in the presence of difunctional monomers as the cross-linkers
to fabricate the hydrogels of AAm and SS. In this study, we used two
types of cross-linkers, bisAA and DVBS, which have a molecular structure
similar to AAm and SS, respectively. The other polymerization conditions
were the same as those for the one-shot polymerization described in
the previous section. Table 1 shows typical results for the preparation of the gels and
the evaluation for their swelling property in water. When a small
amount of cross-linkers was added to the polymerization system (0.6
mol % to the monomers), all the produced polymer chains were incorporated
into the polymer networks, and no soluble polymer was detected by
extraction using a large amount of water after polymerization. The 1H NMR spectra indicated the formation of the gels with the
composition corresponding to the feed monomer ratio, that is, the
AAm/SS ratios incorporated in the hydrogels were 3.16, 5.99, and 8.52
for the feed ratios of 3/1, 6/1, and 9/1, respectively (Figure S4). The heterogeneous polymer structure
may be produced during the gel fabrication, based on the results for
the one-pot polymerization of AAm and SS without any cross-linker.
During the initial stage of the polymerization, the polymers containing
SS-rich segments are predominantly produced. In contrast, the consecutive
AAm segments are produced as the major components around the final
stage of the polymerization. All of the monomers are consumed and
incorporated into the polymer networks as the final products.

a Polymerization conditions: The total
monomer concentration was 0.55 mol/L. [VA-044] = 7.7 mmol/L in PBS
at 37 °C for 4 h (AAm gel) and 24 h (AAm/SS gels) or at 45 °C
for 4 h (SS gel). Total concentration of the cross-linkers was 3.2
mmo/L (0.6 mol % to the monomers). The swelling ratios were determined
in distilled water at room temperature after 18 h.

b The storage modulus (G′) was determined to be 0.70 kPa at 1 Hz and 25 °C with
a strain of 0.01 by a viscoelasticity measurement (see also Figure S6).

c The G′ value
was 0.92 kPa (see Figure S6).

d Not determined due to the loose
structure of the gel.

The microscopic compositions, sequence distribution,
the cross-linking
density, and local chain dynamics of the gels determine the performance
for the optical tissue clearing, but it is not easy to fully define
a polymer network structure. In this study, we examined the effects
of the polymerization conditions on the swelling behavior of the obtained
hydrogels. The dried samples were gradually swollen during immersion
in water at room temperature (Figure S5). The AAm/SS gel exhibited an excellent swelling property, and the
infinite swelling ratio was as high as 5120–9520% after 18
h (Table 1). Electrostatic
repulsion between the negatively charged SS units on the polymer chain
resulted in highly swollen and loose hydrogels. Actually, the swelling
ratio significantly depended on the composition of the gels; that
is, the swelling ratio decreased along with an increase in the AAm/SS
ratio. The AAm gel as the nonelectrolyte gel showed a swelling ratio
of 1860%, which was much lower than those of the AAm/SS gels. The
SS gel was difficult to be used for the swelling ratio measurement
because it was too soft and fragile. An increase in the SS content
led to an increasing swelling ratio of the gels and finally induced
collapse of the gels. Consequently, it reduced the apparent swelling
ratio, as shown in the gel prepared with AAm/SS = 1/9 in Table 1. The much higher
reactivity of SS seems to produce a soluble polymer during the copolymerization
of AAm and SS using only bisAA as the cross-linker. Actually, however,
no soluble polymer was extracted from the gels produced after the
complete conversion of both monomers (see also Figure S4), and the swelling property of the gel produced
using only bisAA under the AAm/SS = 1/1 condition was similar to those
for the other gels (Table 1). The swelling ratio was 5610% for the gel produced with
bisAA at AAm/SS = 1/1, and this swelling ratio was slightly smaller
than those for the gels produced in the presence of only DVBS and
both DVBS and bisAA, (6910 and 8440%, respectively). The time–conversion
curves indicate a large difference in the consumption rates of SS
and AAm, but no induction period was observed in these curves. This
means the incorporation of AAm and bisAA even at the early stage of
the copolymerization, leading to the production of the gel containing
both AAm and SS units as the final product under these copolymerization
conditions. The network structures of the gels, such as monomer sequences
and the distribution of cross-linking points, possibly depend on the
type of the cross-linkers, leading to different performances for optical
tissue clearing.

Viscoelastic and Compression Properties
We prepared
the harder AAm/SS gels for the polymerization in water in the presence
of a larger amount of cross-linkers (2 or 3.3 mol % to the monomers)
using ammonium persulfate (APS) as the radical initiator in water
at 70 °C. APS was used because it produced no nitrogen gas bubbles
in the gels. The obtained gels were used for the rheology and compression
mechanical tests. The preparation conditions, the swelling ratios,
the elastic modulus, and the fracture strain are summarized in Table 2.

in molar ratio.

The equilibrium swelling ratios of the AAm/SS gels
were 4810–7050%
in water at 25 °C. The G′ values at a
small strain (γ < 0.01) were 4–6 kPa for the AAm/SS
and AAm gels, while the G′ values for the
SS gel was much lower (102 Pa), as shown in the strain dependence
of the storage and loss moduli for the gels (Figure S7). These values suggest the formation of the harder gels
with a high cross-linking density, compared to the gels prepared under
the conditions described in Table 1. The relationship between the compression strain and
stress is shown in Figure 4. The curves for the AAm/SS gels were different from those
for the AAm gel and the SS gel. The AAm/SS gels exhibited the maximum
strength with 50–70 kPa at ca. 60% of compression strain, independent
of the AAm/SS compositions. The elastic moduli determined from the
initial slopes of the compression curves were in the range of 29–69
kPa. The AAm/SS gel prepared under the condition of [AAm]0/[SS]0 = 1/6 was exceptionally different from the other
AAm/SS gels (Figure 4b), that is, the elastic modulus and the strength of that gel were
lower. The AAm gel also showed a lower elastic modulus and strength.
The SS gel was soft and fragile because of the loose cross-linking
even under the preparation conditions shown in Table 2.

gels with various
compositions, (c) AAm/SS gels prepared under the conditions of different
monomers and cross-linker ratios, and (d) AAm gels prepared under
the conditions of different monomers and cross-linker ratios. The
compression rate was 1 mm/min using columnar samples with 20 mm diameter
and 10 mm height. The preparation conditions for the gels are shown
in Table 2. The molar
ratio of the monomers and the cross-linkers was 50/1 for the preparation
of the gels in (a,b).

The mechanical properties of the AAm/SS gels are
controlled by
the network structures, and they are quite dependent on the ratio
of the monomers and cross-linkers.19−30 In this study, we also prepared the AAm/SS gel and the AAm gel with
more dense cross-linking structures by using cross-linkers at a higher
concentration. When the ratio of the monomers to the cross-linkers
was changed from 50 to 30, harder gels are produced as shown in Table 2. The swelling ratio
decreased from 4970 to 3900% and the elastic modulus increased from
50.3 to 93.3 kPa for the AAm/SS gels. Similar changes were observed
for the AAm gels. As shown in the results of the compression test
in Figure 4c, the harder
gel exhibited a breaking point at a lower compression strain. In the
literature, typical double-network gels have been prepared by the
two-step polymerization process,20 which
includes the formation of rigid and brittle polyelectrolyte as the
first network and then a soft and ductile neutral polymer as the second
network. A large amount of the second network, usually 20–30
times higher, is used. During the fabrication of the first network,
the polymerization was carried out in the presence of a high concentration
of a cross-linker. We also synthesized an AAm/SS gel at a higher cross-linker
concentration to check whether a high-strength hydrogel similar to
those described in the literature is produced or not, that is, under
the feed condition of [AAm]0/[bisAA]0/[SS]0/[DVBS]0 = 2/0.1/1/4. In this study, however, only
a weak gel was produced as shown in Table 2 and Figure 4c. This was because of the slow propagation rates of
the SS and DVBS monomers. The limited solubility of SS and DVBS was
also disadvantageous for the formation of a dense and well-developed
first network structure. We observed a plateau region for the stress–strain
curves during the compression test of the AA/SS gels (Figure 4). Similar compression curves
with a plateau region were reported for some other double-network
hydrogels,45−47 although the detailed fracture mechanism is unclear
for the AAm/SS hydrogels. Because the expansion of the SS first network
is insufficient in the present case, the observed S–S curves
might be related to that for the second or later cycle during repeating
loading/deloading mechanical tests. We are now continuing the investigation
of the mechanical properties of the double-network gels prepared by
the one-shot radical polymerization. In this study, we focused on
the application of the AAm/SS gels with a double-network structure
to the rapid optical tissue clearing.

Optical Tissue Clearing
We performed optical clearing
of tumor tissues using the passive CLARITY method with the AAm/SS
gels prepared in this study. The general CLARITY method consists of
the following processes: (i) The tissue is incubated in a cold monomer
solution containing AAm, bisAA, a radical initiator, and PFA. The
PFA generates formaldehyde as the mediator for cross-linking between
the proteins and polymer networks. (ii) The polymerization is initiated
by incubation at 37 °C, resulting in the fixation of the protein
in the hydrogel. (iii) The lipids are then removed through diffusion
in a detergent-containing buffer. (iv) Finally, the refractive index
of the media is adjusted by the substitution of the aqueous media
to the refractive index matching solutions.33,42 In the present study, we used the AAm/SS gels ([AAm]0/[SS]0 = 1/1 in molar ratio) prepared in the presence
of bisAAm and/or DVBS (0.6 mmol %). The mechanical toughness of the
obtained gels was enough for the experiments of optical tissue clearing.
The results for the evaluation of the optical tissue clearing are
shown in Figure 5.
The opaque tissues became transparent after the lipid removal using
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 2 days. The tumor tissues treated
with the gels prepared in the presence of DVBS became more rapidly
transparent. The transparency of the tissues was estimated using ImageJ
in this study. The transmittance was determined to be 88 and 74% after
the SDS treatment for 2 days, while it was only 23% when bisAA was
used. After the removal of the detergent and the immersion in ethylene
glycol to adjust the refractive index, each tissue became clearer.
The lipid molecules in the tissue-embedded hydrogel were rapidly excluded
to reduce the osmotic pressure. The SS networks of the double-network
AAm/SS gels play an important role in the efficient removal of the
lipid. The use of DVBS as the effective cross-linker for the polymerization
of SS led to the expansion of the first networks over the entire gels.
In contrast, bisAA is not suitable for the SS network formation during
the initial stage of the polymerization for the gel preparation. Probably,
the SS-rich domains are discontinuously located in the gels. It was
actually disadvantageous for the lipid removal process using SDS,
as shown in Figure 5a. Thus, we have demonstrated the validity of the use of not only
SS as the anionic monomer but also DVBS as the cross-linker, which
was efficient for the SS network formation.

Conclusions
In the present study, we demonstrated the
convenient synthesis
of double-network gels by the one-shot radical polymerization of AAm
and SS with different reactivities for the propagation in the presence
of bifunctional monomers as the cross-linkers. This new method is
advantageous because of the one-pot and one-shot process for the polymerization
while double-network gels are prepared by a two-step polymerization
process in many cases. In addition, it was revealed that the double-network
gels containing polyelectrolyte segments with an anionic charge were
available for the fixation matrix gels for optical tissue clearing.
The new cross-linker DVBS led to the production of the expanded SS
network structure, which was valid for shortening the tissue clearing
time. The present method for the synthesis of double-network gels
by the one-shot polymerization can be applied to many combinations
of reactive and less-reactive monomers other than SS and AAm. The
mechanical strength of the AAm/SS gels prepared in this study was
lower than those for the other double-network gels reported in the
literature. It was because of the unexpanded network structure of
SS as the first monomer because of the slow propagation rate of SS.
We are now continuing our investigation of the synthesis and characterization
of the double-network gels using the one-shot polymerization technique.

pH meter LAUAtein (Horiba, Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) was used for the pH
measurement. The mechanical properties were characterized using a
HAAKE MARS III rheometer (Haake Technik GmbH, Vreden, Germany). The
sample hydrogels were placed between parallel plates of 20 mm diameter
at 25 °C. A compression test was performed at room temperature
using Autograph AGS-X 1 kN (Shimadzu Corporation, Ltd., Kyoto, Japan)
and a columnar sample with a 20 mm diameter and 10 mm height at a
compression rate of 1 mm/min. Freeze-drying was carried out using
FDU-1200 (EYELA Corporation, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Tissue clearing
was performed using bio-chamber BCP 120-F (Taitec Corporation, Osaka
Japan) and a rotary shaker NR-2 (Taitec Corporation, Osaka Japan).

Homopolymerization
To the mixture of AAm (0.200 g)
or SS (0.577 g) in 5 mL of the phosphate buffered saline prepared
using D2O (PBS–D2O) and 0.5 mL of 1,2-dimethoxyethane
as the internal standard, nitrogen gas was bubbled through the solution
at 0 °C for 5 min. After the addition of VA-044 (0.0125 g), the
solution was transferred to an NMR tube. Nitrogen was charged again,
and the polymerization was performed at 37 °C. The monomer and
initiator concentrations were 0.55 and 7.7 mmol/L, respectively. After
polymerization for a specific time, an NMR spectrum was recorded.
The monomer conversions were determined based on a change in the intensity
of the characteristic peaks because of the AAm and SS monomers observed
at 5.75–5.90 and 5.30–5.45 ppm, respectively. The pH
values of the solutions were determined before and after the polymerization.
The pH was constant of 6.87 during the polymerization.

One-Shot Polymerization of AAm and SS
The one-shot
polymerization of AAm and SS was carried out according to a procedure
similar to the homopolymerization. The total monomer concentration
was 0.55 mol/L. The ratio of AAm to SS was changed in the range of
12/1 to 12/1 molar ratio in the feed. The conversion of each monomer
was determined after polymerization by NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra of the reaction mixture of AAm and SS ([AAm]0/[SS]0 = 1/1 in molar ratio) in PBS–D2O before and after the polymerization for 3 h are shown in Figure S1. The conversion of the monomers was
determined based on the change in the peak intensity because of the
vinyl hydrogens (the peaks a and d for AAm and SS, respectively, in Figure S1).

Preparation of Hydrogels
AAm (0.2 g) and SS (0.58 g)
as the monomers and bisAA (4.9 mg) and DVBS (7.4 mg) as the cross-linkers
were dissolved in 5 mL of PBS. Nitrogen gas was then bubbled through
the solution at 0 °C for 5 min. After the addition of VA-044
(0.0125 g), the solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 4 or 8
h for the AAm/SS gels, at 37 °C for 4 h for the AAm gel, and
at 45 °C for 4 h for the SS gels. The obtained hydrogels were
immersed in distilled water for 48 h to remove the water-soluble compounds.
The weight of the dried gels was measured after freeze-drying. Some
portions of the gels were provided for 1H NMR measurement
in PBS–D2O. The hydrogels for determination of the
mechanical properties were also prepared using APS as the radical
initiator at 70 °C for 4 h. Hydrogels were swollen in distilled
water, and the swelling ratio was calculated using the following equation  where Wdry and Wwet are the weights of the dried gel and obtained
hydrogel, respectively. The number of samples was 1–4.

Optical Tissue Clearing Method
Tumor tissues obtained
from tumor-bearing mice (MDA-MB-231 cell-implanted nude mice) were
stored in a formalin solution.48 The tissues
were manually sliced into pieces of 0.7 mm thickness. The size of
the test pieces was 6–9 mm × 2–5 mm. The optical
tissue clearing was carried out according to previous reports.42,49 The small tissues were immersed in 10 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) containing
AAm and/or SS (0.56 mol/L), bisAA and/or DVBS (3.2 × 10–2 mmol/L), VA-044 (7.73 mmol/L), and PFA (1.33 mol/L) at 4 °C
for 24 h. After incubating at 37 °C for 24 h, a hydrogel was
formed. The gel outside the tissue was then removed, and the tissues
were immersed in 30 mL of 0.8 mol/L borate buffer (pH 8.5) containing
4% SDS at 37 °C and shaken for 2 days. Next, the tissues were
placed in 30 mL of a 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 solution. After 2 days
of shaking at 37 °C, the tissues were immersed in 20 mL of ethylene
glycol for 1 h. Images of the tissues were obtained before and after
the SDS treatment and after the final step. An image analysis was
conducted with ImageJ software version 1.52a (23 April 2018, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The transmittance of a black bar (width 0.7 mm) under the tissues
in the images was determined.
