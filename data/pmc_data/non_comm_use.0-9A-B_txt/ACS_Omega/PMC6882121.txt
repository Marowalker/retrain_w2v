P–O–H polycondensation
−O–Cu–O–
ion-bonded bridges were formed in copper phosphate thermal insulation
materials by mixing Al(OH)3 dissolved in H3PO4 with CuO filler and Al2O3, SiC, ZrC,
and Cr2O3 as curing accelerators, alone or in
combination. The effects of different additive combinations on the
curing behavior and thermal stability of the copper phosphate thermal
insulation material matrixes were compared using thermogravimetry/differential
scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffractometry, and scanning electron
microscopy. The copper phosphate materials exhibit good thermal stabilities
and low thermal conductivities. The thermal weight losses before and
after ceramic reinforcement were 4–19.8 and 3.8–9.4%,
respectively, and the thermal conductivities of the P–O–H
polycondensation −O–Cu–O– ion-bonded bridges
formed in the copper phosphate thermal insulation materials were in
the range of 0.656–1.824 W/(m·K).

1 Introduction
With
the rapid development of science and technology, a large number
of new energy technologies have been researched and applied.1−5 At the same time, improving energy efficiency is also an important
part of future sustainable energy planning.6 Among them, the development of insulation materials has played a
vital role. It has been widely used in aerospace, automotive, construction,
household appliances, petrochemical industries, and so forth.7 For example, excellent thermal insulation is
a vital requirement for hypersonic aircraft enclosures to protect
the interior of the aircraft from surface ultrahigh temperatures.8

At present, common insulation materials
include ceramic heat-insulating
tiles,9 organic insulating materials,10 and ceramic aerogels.11 Although such materials have produced ideal results in certain applications,
their disadvantages include low useable temperatures, poor thermal
matching, and complicated production processes. In addition, the integrity
of the bonding between a heat-insulating and heat-resistant material
is difficult to ensure in practical applications, which complicates
the fabrication and repair processes, particularly in the context
of large structures.

Phosphate-based materials are preferable
to the above-mentioned
insulating materials because of their low curing temperatures, structural
design flexibilities, and high bonding strengths.12−15 When used to develop insulation
materials, phosphate-based materials are inexpensive and easy to apply.
In addition, phosphate materials provide good load distributions,
which reduce stress concentrations and avoid defects, such as cracks
and holes.16 Second, phosphate materials
can accommodate the strain caused by differences in thermal expansion
coefficients and temperature changes, which minimizes excessive damaging
stress in the ceramic.16 Third, the performance
of phosphate materials can be tuned through the use of additives and
reinforcing materials to satisfy a variety of requirements.16 Finally, phosphate materials have very low thermal
conductivities and can act as strong barriers to heat transfer; consequently,
they are a promising new type of insulation material for a range of
applications.17−19

Phosphates are formed by the reaction of metal
oxides with phosphoric
acid or phosphate. Kingery reacted various oxides with a phosphoric
acid solution and recorded the condensation times and elevated temperatures
required to form the reaction product;20 however, the product produced by that method was mainly hydrogen
phosphate, which has limited applications.21 Chung reacted metal cations in different molar ratios with phosphate
and found that the properties of the phosphate varied with the metal/phosphate
molar ratio.22 Research by Wagh found that
oxides dissolve highly exothermically in phosphoric acid to form saturated
solutions that solidify to form well-crystallized phosphate materials.23 On the basis of these results, the performance
of a phosphate material appears to depend on the ratio of oxide to
phosphoric acid. In addition, the amounts and combinations of additives,
such as acid inhibitors, accelerators, and reinforcing materials,
also impact phosphate performance.24−26

While copper phosphate
materials have attracted attention because
of their simple fabrication, cost effectiveness, and strong binding
forces, there are few reports on this material in the literature to
date. To address this, in this study, we focused on determining the
ideal composition ratio for a copper phosphate heat insulation material
suitable for use in C/C-ultra-high-temperature ceramics. We accomplished
this by investigating the microstructures of copper phosphates with
different composition ratios, characterizing the thermal properties
of these copper phosphate materials by thermal-analysis and other
testing techniques, and studying the thermal stabilities and diffusion
behavior of these materials.

2.1 Curing Characteristics
The curing
times and density changes of the copper phosphate materials before
and after modification are listed in Table 2. As shown, the material density was observed
to decrease gradually with increasing amounts of Al(OH)3, and the material had difficulty forming at 25 °C when 50%
Al(OH)3 was added. The sample solidified within a few seconds
but contained many macroscopic pores when a large amount of Al(OH)3 was reacted with H3PO4. The resulting
material exhibited a lower density when a ceramic filler was added,
compared to the material prepared without the filler, and a lowed
curing time was required. This was especially true as the proportion
of Al2O3 was increased, as was observed for
sample G, which had a corresponding curing time of only 262 s.

2.2 Microstructural Characterization
2.2.1 Phase Analysis
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the copper phosphate materials prepared according
to the composition ratios listed in Table 1 are shown in Figure 1, which reveals that the proportions of Al3+ and PO43– in the physical phase
increase with decreasing molar ratios of CuO and Al(OH)3. In addition, when only CuO was added to phosphoric acid, as in
Sample A, the product was primarily composed of Cu2(PO4)(OH) and CuO. In this case, the intensities of the diffraction
peaks corresponding to CuO were higher than those of Cu2(PO4)(OH), which indicate that some unreacted CuO remained
in the sample. Cu3Al4(PO4)2(OH)12·2H2O appeared when Al(OH)3 was added, as evidenced by comparing the peaks of the sample B phase
with those of sample A. Due to the addition of metal cations with
higher potential-series numbers (such as Al3+) to CuO and
H3PO4, H3PO4, they took
precedence over more active metal cationic reactions,27 resulting in a stronger bond between CuO and phosphoric
acid and a denser material microstructure (as shown in Figure 2b). The components in sample
C, which has further reduced molar ratios of CuO and Al(OH)3, were found to be Cu2PO4OH·0.2H2O, CuO, and a small amount of Al(OH)3. The appearance
of Cu2PO4OH·0.2H2O indicates
that the addition of Al(OH)3 promotes the reaction between
CuO and phosphoric acid.

With regard to the promoting ability
of Al(OH)3 in the
reaction of CuO with phosphoric acid, sample D, which has a 1:1 molar
ratio of CuO to Al(OH)3, is primarily composed of AlH3(PO4)2·H2O, Al(H2PO4)(HPO4)·H2O, and
Cu3Al4(PO4)2(OH)12·2H2O. The diffraction peaks corresponding to CuO
in this sample were extremely weak. At this ratio, most of the CuO
reacted to retain PO43–. The XRD pattern
of sample E reveals that AlPO4 is only formed when Al(OH)3 reacts with phosphoric acid; the reaction was fast, and the
curing time was short, which indicates that Al(OH)3 plays
a catalytic role in the copper phosphate material.

As shown
in Figure 2f, the microstructure
of sample B was the densest among the samples
because of its level of unreacted CuO. XRD revealed the appearance
of small amounts of Al(OH)3 when different ceramic fillers
were added to sample B (i.e., samples G–J), which is indicative
of the good chemical stabilities of SiC, ZrC, and Cr2O3 at room temperature (RT). As shown in the XRD pattern, Al2O3 possibly reacted earlier with phosphoric acid
than with Al(OH)3. From a microscopic point of view, the
addition of Al2O3 is likely to accelerate the
condensation reaction of phosphoric acid to produce water vapor, which
is why the proportion of Al(OH)3 is larger and the overall
structure is looser before modification.27

2.3 Structure Characteristics
Since phosphoric
acid continuously polycondenses to form long-chain macromolecular
polyphosphoric acids upon addition of CuO, Cu–O ions bond to
form a phase with alternating covalent and ionic bonds. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of the copper phosphate materials are shown
in Figure 2, which
reveals that the microstructure of sample A is loose and contains
both large and small holes. This observation is possibly ascribable
to the large amount of water vapor generated during solidification
of the CuO/H3PO4 mixture during discharge of
the resulting gas; the lower number of bubbles leads to higher sample
density. As was observed by XRD, the main elements in the white areas
in the SEM image in Figure 2a are Cu and O, whereas the main elements in the gray areas
are Cu, O, and P. Upon further consideration, we conclude that the
white areas correspond to CuO, whereas the gray areas correspond to
Cu2(PO4)(OH). The microstructure of sample B,
in which Al(OH)3 was added, is denser than that of sample
A. As shown in Figure 2b,b1, sample B has a much higher surface density than sample A, which
may be the result of the added Al(OH)3 that accelerates
the rate of phosphoric acid polymerization, as the solution contains
more water than before. This, in turn, reduces the amount of water
vapor generated during curing, which increases the surface density
of sample B. A more uniformly distributed white phase surrounded by
gray is clearly observed in the SEM image, and a black phase is also
present. Qualitative energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed
that the white phase in Figure 2b is primarily composed of Cu and O in the form of CuO; the
gray phase contains O, Al, P, and Cu; and the black phase contains
Al and O. The distribution of elements can be intuitively understood
in Figure S1. As was observed by XRD, the
phases in sample B are primarily composed of Cu2(PO4)(OH), Cu3Al4(PO4)2(OH)12·2H2O, CuO, and a small amount of
Al(OH)3.

The addition of Al(OH)3 accelerates
the rate of phosphoric acid polymerization. The microstructure was
observed to loosen as the Cu2+/Al3+ molar ratio
was reduced from 20/1 to 16/5. As shown in Figure 2c, the microstructure of sample C contains
large distinct particles, with smaller white CuO phases compared to
those in Figure 2b,
and the holes are clearly visible. This may be due to the fact that
the rate of phosphoric acid polycondensation was too fast; when combined
with a lower CuO content, there may be insufficient CuO remaining
after the reaction to fill the pores produced by phosphoric acid polycondensation,
which indicates that the remaining CuO acts as a reactant for the
formation of the copper phosphate material. In other words, the remaining
CuO acts as a filler. The appearance of the Al(OH)3 phase
is evident in Figure 2c, which may be the result of a reaction that is too fast such that
some of the Al(OH)3 does not participate in the reaction
process and solidifies. Therefore, as shown in Figure 2d, the surface of sample D is looser and
is primarily composed of a gray sheetlike structure and fine white
particles. At the same time, the white granular CuO phase is not visible
and large pores are evident.

On this basis, unreacted CuO fills
the pores formed after the polycondensation
of phosphoric acid. As shown in the SEM image, a large number of pores
appear when only Al(OH)3 is reacted with phosphoric acid.
The microstructure after reaction at a 11:8 Al(OH)3-to-phosphoric-acid
molar ratio is shown in Figure 2e, which reveals that the resulting structure is irregularly
connected by a plurality of irregular gray particles, with many large
and small pores throughout. EDS qualitatively revealed that the interiors
of the particles are mainly composed of Al and O, whereas the surfaces
are composed of O, P, and Al. Consistent with the XRD data, the former
is Al(OH)3, and the latter is AlPO4, which suggests
that the particles are linked by AlPO4.

A SEM image
of the material produced when ceramic particles were
added to sample B is shown in Figure 2f, which reveals that Al(OH)3 and SiC particles
are surrounded by phosphoric acid polycondensation reaction products.
As shown in the enlargement of the indicated region (Figure 2f1), the filler particles are
closely connected with the copper phosphate material to provide an
improved interface.

In summary, copper phosphate materials form
by the continuous polycondensation
of phosphoric acid to give long-chain macromolecular polyphosphoric
acids that bond to Cu–O ions to form a phase containing alternating
covalent and ionic bonds. Any remaining unreacted CuO then fills the
pores after polycondensation.

2.4 Thermal
Properties
2.4.1 Thermal Stability
The copper phosphate
material decomposes into copper pyrophosphate and then into copper
metaphosphate upon heating from RT. Figure 3 shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves for the copper
phosphate materials fabricated using different molar ratios of CuO
and Al(OH)3; these materials appear to have three distinct
temperature stages. The first stages for samples A–E occurred
between RT and ∼300 °C (sample A), in the 200–300
°C range (samples B and C), from RT to ∼200 °C (D),
and from RT to ∼250 °C (E). As shown in Figure 3b, the five systems exhibit
wide exothermic peaks at around 100 °C, which are produced by
unreacted phosphoric acid at RT and the residual reactions of CuO
with Al(OH)3 to form phosphate; crystallization therefore
resulted in the release of heat. However, the exothermic reaction
had not yet completely ended at this point. An endothermic peak was
next generated by the decomposition of the amorphous compound, which
released some water. As shown in Figure 3a, samples D and E exhibited larger weight
losses at this stage and lower starting temperatures. Sample D has
a 1:1 molar ratio of CuO to Al(OH)3, and since it had not
completely reacted after curing, as indicated by the XRD pattern in Figure 2, the formed phases
were complicated and possibly unstable; consequently, it began to
decompose at a temperature of about 80 °C. Since a large amount
of the residual Al(OH)3 in sample E decomposed at about
150 °C, the thermal weight loss of sample E was large at a low
temperature; an endothermic peak between 260 and 300 °C was observed
in the first stage, which was the result of the dehydration of the
amorphous compound to copper pyrophosphate.

of copper phosphate samples A–J. (a)
TGA curves of samples A–J; (b) DSC curve of samples A–J.

As the temperature increased, the copper pyrophosphate
was again
polycondensed and dehydrated into a cyclic or long-chain copper metaphosphate.
As shown in Figure 2a, the second dehydration stages for samples A–E were 300–600,
300–600, 300–600, 200–500, and 250–500
°C, respectively. Samples A, B, and C exhibited endothermic peaks
at about 600 °C as the copper phosphate became desorbed from
the crystal water and the copper pyrophosphate was decondensed through
polycondensation to form copper metaphosphate. The temperatures of
samples A, B, and C were approximately 600 °C during the third
stage, while those of D and E were 500 °C. The production of
copper metaphosphate in this stage occurs by the removal of structural
water. As shown in Figure 6, the thermal weight
losses of the final samples A–E were 4.2, 4, 5.8, 19, and 19.8%,
respectively, which indicates that the addition of a small amount
of Al(OH)3 improves the thermal stability of the phosphate
material. However, the thermal weight loss increases with increasing
amounts of added Al(OH)3. Taken together with the XRD and
SEM data, the heat performance and organizational structures of the
B samples suggest that they are suitable for use in high-temperature
environments.

peak of the hydroxyl group at 3440 cm–1 is consistent

vibration peak of [PO4]3–, and around
628 cm–1 is the in-plane bending vibration peak
of [PO4]3–.30 The telescopic vibration peak of Cu–O is near 559 cm–1.31

with CuO.

The addition of the ceramic filler
was found to improve the thermal
stability of the copper phosphate material at high temperatures, despite
the increase in the thermal weight loss. Figure 3 reveals that, while the TGA and DSC curves
of the F samples are quite similar to those of the B samples, the
curves for the other four types of samples are quite different. In
addition, the temperature required for dehydration and polycondensation
into copper pyrophosphate decreased, and no significant weight loss
and reaction occurred above 300 °C, which may be due to the added
ceramic filler that accelerates the polycondensation reaction. The
thermal weight losses of samples F–J were 3.8, 8.5, 7.8, 7.5,
and 9.4%, respectively, which suggests that the addition of the ceramic
filler enhances thermal weight loss. In summary, among the samples
with ceramic fillers, sample F exhibited a low thermal weight loss
rate and a dense microscopic morphology, which is ideal for use in
multicomponent systems.

2.5 Thermophysical
Properties
The thermal
properties of the copper phosphate materials are listed in Table 3, which reveals that
sample A has the lowest thermal diffusivity and that the thermal conductivity
of the corresponding copper phosphate material increased significantly
after the addition of the ceramic filler. Since sample A is mainly
composed of CuO and phosphoric acid in the form of Cu2(PO4)(OH) and CuO, which are networklike macrostructures, and
the microstructure of sample A is relatively loose, its thermal diffusivity
was found to be low. Sample B is mainly composed of Cu2(PO4)(OH), CuO, and a small amount of Cu3Al4(PO4)2(OH)12·2H2O. The amount of residual CuO increases with the addition
of Al(OH)3. As shown in Figure 2, the density of sample B on the microscopic
level was higher than that of sample A, which indicates that sample
B has a higher thermal mass coefficient. There are many Al-containing
phases in the microstructure of sample C; hence its thermal diffusivity
was even higher. The thermal conductivity of samples F–J to
which the ceramic filler was added was higher than that of the sample
B.

3 Discussion
3.1 Aspect of Heat Conduction
The copper
phosphate thermal insulation materials is the composite mainly composed
of phosphate and CuO, so the thermal conductivity largely depends
on the number and arrangement of each of the phases and their respective
thermal conductivities. For the two phases of parallel and vertical
alignment in the composites, the calculation of thermal conductivity
can be performed as two mechanisms of parallel and series. Specifically28 1   2  where Km is the
thermal conductivity of the composites, v1 and v2 are the volume fractions of the
two phases, respectively, and k1 and k2 are the thermal conductivities of the two
phases, respectively.

For a structure formed by a continuous
main phase and a discontinuous second phase or by a discontinuous
main phase and a continuous second phase, it can be calculated by
Maxwell’s relationship28 3  where Km is the
thermal conductivity of the composites, k1and k2 are the thermal conductivities
of the continuous phase and the dispersed phase, respectively, and v2 is the volume fraction of the dispersed phase.

It can be seen from the formula 1–3 that when adding the component, which possesses
higher thermal conductivity in the composites, the overall thermal
conductivity increases. In this study, the copper phosphate material
was a macromolecular polymer with very low intrinsic thermal conductivity.
Samples F–J were formed by adding a ceramic filler to sample
B as a matrix. As shown in Table 3, the thermal conductivity of samples F–J was
higher than that of sample B. At the same time, the higher the content
of the ceramic filler, the higher the thermal conductivity, and so
the thermal conductivity of sample G is higher than that of sample
F. When a filler containing a higher thermal conductivity is added,
the thermal conductivity is also increased. The sample with high thermal
conductivity of Cr2O3 has a higher thermal conductivity
under the same ceramic filler composition.

In inorganic nonmetallic
materials, heat flow is mainly carried
by acoustic phonons, and its thermal conductivity can be expressed
by the following formula29 4  where CV is the specific heat capacity, v is the average
sound velocity, and l is the phonon mean free path.
The mean free path of phonons is a key factor affecting thermal conductivity.
In practice, scattering of other phonons and various defects can also
affect thermal conductivity. Therefore, for sample B with a more dense
microstructure, the average free path of the phonons is larger and
the thermal conductivity is higher than that of sample A. Because
the microstructure of sample H was looser (as shown in Figure S2), the mean free path of the phonon
decreased, resulting in the lowest thermal conductivity of the sample
added to the ceramic filler.

3.2 Curing Mechanism of Cu–O
Ion Bonds
on Copper Phosphate Materials
The formation of reticulated
inorganic polymers by phosphoric acid condensation and Cu–O
ionic-bond bridges increases the viscosity of the solution and forms
copper phosphate materials with high bonding strengths after curing.
Since the outer electronic configuration of phosphorus is 3s23p3, concentrated phosphoric acid forms a structure of
regular PO4 tetrahedrons. P–O–H is dehydrated
and condensed and is connected by oxygen bridges to form a mixture
of polyphosphoric acids, Hn+2 (PnO3n+1). PO43– is present in the phosphoric acid solution and
is polymerized by the addition of a basic oxide during the reaction.
The resulting PO42– units become nodes
in the polymer chain. As the reaction progresses, PO42– is converted into PO4– ions, which is an intermediate structure arising during the reaction,
and is connected end-to-end to form a linear polyphosphate. In the
later stage of the reaction, the branched structure formed by uncharged
PO4 is continuously extended outward until a spatial three-dimensional
network is formed, as shown in Figure 5. Note that CuO is typically a monoclinic crystal at
25 °C and is weakly basic; it exists in an ionic-bonded form
as Cu–O with a bond energy of 82 kcal/mol. The interaction
forces between crystals are generally van der Waals, although the
Cu–O ionic bonds that form in the bodies of copper phosphate
crystals have large binding forces, as shown in Figure 6. In this case, CuO reacts with concentrated
phosphoric acid to form copper phosphate, copper pyrophosphate, and
other phosphates that mostly contain Cu2+, H2PO4–, HPO42–, and PO43– plasma. The continuous distribution
of the networked inorganic polymer formed by the polycondensation
of phosphoric acid, −O–Cu–O– ion-bonded
bridges, ionic bonding forces, and hydrogen-bonding forces cause Cu2+ and PO43– to form a continuous
and interpenetrating phase before combining with the unreacted CuO.
As was observed by XRD, the main product of the reaction between CuO
and phosphoric acid is Cu2(PO4)(OH), as evidenced
by its Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum (Figure 4). The viscosity of the solution
increases and the rate of ion movement decreases as the phosphoric
acid continues to polymerize. To some extent, the degree of reaction
between CuO and phosphoric acid decreases until the sample is completely
cured. As shown in the SEM images, the samples solidify to produce
strongly bonded structures.

As shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, the curing time shortens and the microstructure of
the material becomes denser with the addition of Al(OH)3 because the Al3+ in Al(OH)3 is more active
than Cu2+; hence, phosphoric acid reacts preferentially
with Al(OH)3, which increases the rate of polycondensation,
accelerates the rate of curing, and further increases the chance that
large numbers of bubbles are generated by the water vapor produced
during the reaction; the sample is denser when fewer bubbles are generated.
The equations describing the reactions of phosphoric acid are 5   6   7  

As only a small amount of Al(OH)3 was added during
the
reaction, aluminum phosphate molecules formed once Al(OH)3 had completely reacted with phosphoric acid, and after it began
to converge, the remaining phosphoric acid continued to react with
CuO.32 The degree of phosphate polymerization
increased as the reaction progressed, and the temperature of the reaction
also increased to eventually form a networklike macromolecular structure.
The cohesive force of the phosphate material, along with its strength,
can be seen to increase with increasing degree of longitudinal bonding
in the polyphosphoric acid macromolecule. From the microscopic structure
of the copper phosphate in Figure 2b, the unreacted CuO interspersed with the copper phosphate
material to form a dense copper phosphate material. However, the density
of the copper phosphate material was observed to decrease with increasing
Al(OH)3 content, even at 25 °C. On the basis of these
results, the optimum molar ratio of CuO/Al(OH)3/H3PO4 was determined to be 20:1:8.

4 Conclusions
In this work, a series of Cu/Al ratio copper
phosphate insulation
materials were prepared by designing variables, and the thermal stability
and thermal conductivity were measured by thermal analysis. The results
show that the addition of a small amount of Al(OH)3 makes
the microstructure dense, but the excess will decrease. In this study,
the microstructure of the most compact B combination Cu/Al molar ratio
is 20/1, and the thermal weight loss rate at 900 °C is less than
5%. In addition, this bonding structure has a low thermal conductivity
of 0.872 W/(m K). On the basis of the results obtained in this study,
we conclude that copper phosphate is a very promising class of material
for thermal insulation at high temperatures.

5.1 Material Preparation
The primary
raw material in this study was composed of CuO (analytical grade,
AR, Sinopharm Group), Al(OH)3 (analytical grade, AR, Sinopharm
Group), and phosphoric acid solution (analytical grade, AR, Sinopharm
Group). The following materials were used as fillers in the ratios
listed in Table 1:
Al2O3 (analytical grade, AR, Sinopharm Group),
Green SiC (analytically pure, AR, Sinopharm Group), ZrC (Jinzhou Hao
Tian Titanium Powder Processing Co., Ltd., 400 mesh), and Cr2O3 (analytically pure, AR, Sinopharm Group). The copper
phosphate material was synthesized using a liquid-phase reaction method.
Sample A (as an example) was prepared as follows: 8 mol of phosphoric
acid solution and 20 mol of CuO powder were combined in a beaker and
thoroughly stirred until the mixture solidified completely.

To fully study the formation mechanism of the copper phosphate material,
the performances of samples A to E were compared, from which the distribution
ratio of sample B was selected. The distribution ratios of samples
F–J were selected by exploring the influence of nonreactive
filler additives on the properties of the copper phosphate material.

5.2 Characterization
Each sample was
subjected to phase analysis using a RIKEN D/max (2550) fully automatic
(18 kW) brick target X-ray diffractometer with a current of 20 mA,
a voltage of 35 kV, and a scanning interval of 0.02°. Morphological,
microstructural, and qualitative elemental analyses were performed
using a Thermo Fisher Quanta FEG 250 field-emission scanning electron
microscope and an EDS system. TGA and DSC were conducted in air using
a TA Instruments SDT650 synchronous thermal analyzer at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min to 900 °C. The thermal diffusivity and
specific heat capacity were measured using a NETZSCH LFM457 laser
thermal conductivity meter, and the thermal conductivity of the copper
phosphate material was calculated using formula 8 8  where
λ is the thermal conductivity
in W/(m K), α is the thermal diffusion coefficient in mm2/s, ρ is the density in g/cm3, and Cp is the specific heat capacity
in J/g/K.

The sample was processed into a pellet sample φ
10 mm × 2.5 mm in size. Note that the thermal conductivity λ
refers to the heat per unit area passing through the unit area per
unit time under a unit temperature gradient and has the units of W/(m
K). The thermal diffusivity indicates the ability of the material
to align within the temperature gradient.
