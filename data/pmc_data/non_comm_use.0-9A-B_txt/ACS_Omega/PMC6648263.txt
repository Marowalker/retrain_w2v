An expedient solvent-free methodology
has been developed to produce
1-substituted 1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazoles using sodium
borosilicate glass-supported silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as a novel
heterogeneous catalyst. A cost-efficient, facile, and greener method
was deployed for the creation of Ag/sodium borosilicate nanocomposite
(ASBN) catalyst by using Aleurites moluccana leaf extract as a stabilizing and reducing agent. The ASBN catalyst
was identified using the latest microscopic and spectroscopic techniques
such as FT-IR, TEM, FESEM, XRD, EDS, and elemental mapping. The deployment
of this new catalyst enables the preparation of assorted 1-substituted
tetrazoles in good to high yields via an easy work-up procedure in
a relatively short reaction time under environmentally friendly conditions
without using harmful and toxic reducing agents. The ASBN catalyst
can be recycled and reused multiple times without meaningful loss
of activity. To extend the application of the ASBN, the performance
of the quantitative structure–activity relationships model
was investigated for protein binding and toxicity hazard considerations.

==== Body
Introduction
Tetrazoles are a significant
class of heterocyclic
compounds with wide-ranging applications in diverse areas of industry
and science.1 Recently, they have attracted
considerable attention because of their extensive utility in coordination
chemistry,2−4 medicinal chemistry
and pharmaceutical sciences,5−14 and also in materials science including oxygen-containing fuels.15−17 Tetrazoles can be utilized as
precursors for diverse nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g., triazoles,
thiazoles, and oxazolidones).18,19 Due to their broad
applications,
the investigation on the catalytic preparation of tetrazoles has been
of immense interest, and especially, 1-substituted tetrazole derivatives
have been the subject of fundamental research in view of their biological20 and medical applications.5

Although a wide variety of 5-substituted
tetrazoles have been documented, only a handful attempts have been
made to empower the greener preparative procedures for 1-substituted
tetrazoles.21,22 Most reported protocols entail
acid-catalyzed cycloaddition of isocyanides with hydrazoic acid23,24 and trimethyl azide,25 and cyclization
among primary amines and their salts, triethyl orthoformate, and sodium
azide by using catalysts such as Yb(OTf)3,26 AcOH,27 In(OTf)3,17 [HBIm]BF4,28 and more recently, natrolite.29

Among the published synthetic procedures, a number of them have several
drawbacks such as the use of N,N′-dimethylformamide as a solvent, refluxing for an extended
period, tedious work-up of the reactions, the use of expensive and
toxic reagents, under “dry” reaction conditions, lower
yields, difficulty in separation and recovery of the catalyst, and
the use of volatile, highly toxic, and explosive hydrazoic acid. Therefore,
the development of straightforward catalytic procedures and eco-friendly
approaches for the preparation of 1-substituted tetrazoles to circumvent
these drawbacks is highly desirable.

Over the decades, the usage
of heterogeneous catalysts has grown for the production of tetrazoles
due to superior catalytic activity, low noxiousness and cost, simple
recovery, and ease of handling;21,29−31 metal nanoparticles (NPs), namely,
Pd, Pt, Au, Cu, and Ag, have also been investigated.31,32 Among metal NPs, Ag NPs have been deployed as proficient catalysts
for their unique properties such as their high surface energy and
high catalytic activity. Although the clustering of metal NPs through
the reaction process is usually unavoidable,33−37 its prevention has been attempted by immobilizing
Ag NPs on a suitable solid prop such as TiO2,33 Fe3O4,8,34,35 SiO2,36 and graphene,37 among others.

The
sodium borosilicate glass can be used for the immobilization of different
metal NPs as an ideal host.38 It has a
considerable applicability as an effective support in catalysis because
of the extremely porous and ordered structure, high specific surface
area, high chemical resistance, outstanding chemical steadiness, mechanical
strength, inexpensiveness, subdued thermal expansion coefficient,
and superior ultraviolet clarity. Nevertheless, despite these favorable
characteristics, there are still only a few examples of their use.39,40

Various chemical and physical methods have been reported for the synthesis of metal NPs, but many of these procedures suffer from limitations.
The biological synthetic methods for metal NPs avoid the use of organic
solvents or harmful materials, toxic capping agents or stabilizers,
higher temperature calcinations or pressure, and the formation of
hazardous by-products.41−49

Euphorbia plants are widely distributed and
range from shrubs and herbs to
trees in temperate regions and tropical parts of the world, and Aleurites moluccana from the family Euphorbiaceae
is customarily known as possible substitute medicine for typhoid fever
and diarrhea treatment. The medicinal effect of the plant is because
of its rich phytochemical content including glycerides, stearic acid,
palmitic acid, linoleic acid, myristic acid, protein, oil, and vitamin
B1, whereas the stem bark includes polyphenols, flavonoids,
alkaloids, tannins, coumarins, steroids, and triterpenoids especially
in plant seeds.50−53 The phytochemical constituents of the plant
and especially its polyphenolic contents encouraged us to use it for
the synthesis of nanoparticles via an easy and greener protocol.

Following the literature review, there is no report on the application
of the sodium borosilicate as an efficient prop for the immobilization
of silver NPs by using leaf extracts. In view of our research on the
preparation of tetrazoles and the appliance of heterogeneous catalysts,21,29 herein, we explored the A. moluccana extract from leaves for the synthesis of Ag/sodium borosilicate54 nanocomposite (ASBN) as a novel and efficient
heterogeneous catalyst. Thus, we used this nanocomposite for catalyzing
the [2 + 3] cycloaddition of amines with sodium azide for the preparation
of 1-substituted 1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazoles (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 1H-1,2,3,4-Tetrazoles
Using the ASBN Catalyst
Additionally,
we examined the potential ecosystem effect in terms of protein binding
and toxicity data on human health with predicted outcome for 1-substituted
1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazoles prepared by our catalyst.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Identification of the ASBN
Catalyst
In
the present method, A. moluccana extract
from leaves was deployed for the preparation of ASBN without using
any surfactants, reductants, and hazardous or toxic materials. The
extract from the leaves of the plant acted not only as a reducing
agent and antioxidant source but also functioned as a stabilizer for
the prepared Ag NPs adorning the surface of sodium borosilicate glass
as an economical, effective, and stable support. The ensuing Ag/sodium
borosilicate nanocomposites were completely analyzed by different
techniques, namely, XRD, FT-IR, FESEM, EDX, TEM, and elemental mapping
analyses. The catalytic activity of biosynthesized ASBN was evaluated
for the preparation of 1-substituted 1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazoles
via cycloaddition of amines and sodium azide. There are some compounds
such as polyphenols and flavonoids in the plant extracts, which have
the ability to give electrons and can undergo quick oxidation. Thus,
the synthesis of Ag NPs was examined by exploiting the extract from
the leaves of A. moluccana through
the reduction of Ag+ ions to Ag(0) in the presence of free
electrons (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Biosynthesis of Ag
NPs Using the Aqueous Extract of A. moluccana Leaves
The UV spectrum analysis
of the extract displayed bands
around 301 nm (band 1) because of the transition localized inside
the cinnamoyl system of aromatics encompassing conjugation, whereas
the band centered around 225 nm (band II) is associated to the π
→ π* transitions, which is in agreement with absorbance
for the benzoyl group of aromatic systems that are conjugated (Figure 1). Such absorbent
bands are typical of flavonoids;55 thus,
the outcomes from the UV–Vis spectrum certainly reinforce the
literature precedent for the occurrence of phenolics inside the plant
extract.52,53,55

Figure 1 UV–Vis
spectra for leaf extract
from plant and synthesized Ag NPs.

The UV–Vis
spectrum of synthesized Ag NPs (Figure 1) described the impact of surface plasmon resonance
signals on the metal ions due to noteworthy changes in the absorbance
maxima at around 450 nm, revealing the interaction of constituents
of leaf extract with ionic silver and the formation of nanoproducts
(Scheme 2). The bioprotecting
action of the adsorbed phytochemicals imparts adequate stability to
the green synthesized nanoparticles with no major alteration in the
symmetry of the absorption peak even after 15 days (Figure 1).

Furthermore, the FT-IR
spectrum of the green Ag NPs displayed peaks at 3500, 1695, and 1465
cm–1, which signify the presence of free OH and
OH group involved in hydrogen bond formation, the presence of carbonyl
group (C=O), and stretching of C=C aromatic bonds, respectively;
peaks distinctly showed the presence of phytochemicals adorning the
exterior of green nanoparticles as stabilizing and capping agents
(Figure 2).

Figure 2 FT-IR spectrum
of greener
biosynthesized Ag NPs.

The FT-IR analysis was undertaken to learn about the potential molecules
responsible for capping of the produced ASBN catalyst. As shown in Figure 3, the bands appearing
∼3450 and 1647 cm–1 were assigned to −OH
stretching and bending vibrations of molecular water present, respectively.
The peaks at 1098 and 807 cm–1 correspond to the
Si–O–Si bond and stretching B–O bond of the BO4 tetrahedral, respectively (Scheme 3). The absorption band at 477 cm–1 is assignable the Si–O–Si, and peaks appear at ∼1472
cm–1 probably due to the stretching vibrations of
the B–O bonds existing in diverse boron organizational units.38,56 Moreover, the peak at ∼949 cm–1 shows the
stretching vibrations for the Si–O–B bond.38,56

ASBN catalyst.

Scheme 3 Proposed Structure
of the Ag/Sodium Borosilicate
Nanocomposite
The formation of
Ag NPs on the exterior of sodium borosilicate
glass has been confirmed by XRD, TEM, FESEM, EDS, and elemental analyses;
the crystalline structure of the ASBN was apparent from the XRD analysis
(Figure 4), a broad
peak at 2θ = 21°–25° being attributed to amorphous
silica. The XRD of the ASBN shows five characteristic peaks at 38.1,
44.0, 64.4, 77.3, and 85.2 corresponding to (111), (200), (220), (311),
and (222) planes of the face-centered cubic (fcc) Ag crystals, respectively.

Figure 4 XRD pattern
of the synthesized ASBN catalyst.

The exterior morphology of the ASBN was determined by FESEM
images
(Figure 5), wherein
the sodium borosilicate is covered with synthesized Ag NPs via greener
method. The SEM images show that the Ag NPs appear as uniformly dispersed
bright spots on the exterior of sodium borosilicate glass matrix with
narrow size dispersal.

Figure 5 FESEM images
of the ASBN at different magnifications.

The distribution of the various elements
in the ASBN was also analyzed by elemental mapping images and EDS
spectrum; the EDS spectrum in Figure 6 elucidates the presence of Ag, B, C, Si, Al, Na, and O elements in the ASBN. Further, the elemental mapping pictures of
the Cu/sodium borosilicate nanocomposite (Figure 7) show the dispersion of the Ag NPs on the
sodium borosilicate glass surface.

the ASBN catalyst.

Figure 8 depicts the TEM analysis of the ASBN at
varying magnifications where the spherical morphology with a narrow
size distribution is apparent. Further, results from SEM, TEM, and
XRD analysis for the ASBN affirmed that Ag NPs are immobilized on
the surface of the sodium borosilicate.

Preparation 1-Substituted Tetrazoles Using the ASBN Catalyst
To scrutinize the feasibility of our rationale and to identify the
optimal conditions, the reaction of 4-chloroaniline with sodium azide
and triethyl orthoformate was carried out in the presence of varying
amounts of the ASBN catalyst (Table 1). The control test showed that no effective reaction
occurred in the absence of catalyst (entry 1). Nevertheless, the supplement
of the catalyst has rapidly increased the formation of the product
in a high yield, the optimum amount of ASBN being 0.05 g (entry 6).
Further, experimentations disclosed that heating was needed for the
reaction, apparently 120 °C being the most effective temperature
(Table 1, entry 6).
The use of lower catalyst loadings and lower temperature did not lead
to completion of reaction (entry 4). To further delineate the influence
of the prepared catalyst, the model reaction was conducted in the
presence of sodium borosilicate (entries 2 and 3); ASBN is highly
reactive than sodium borosilicate. The sodium borosilicate as a prop
inhibits the aggregation of Ag NPs, and its synergic effect is significant
in this synthetic protocol. These optimal reaction conditions (amine,
2.0 mmol; sodium azide, 2.0 mmol; triethyl orthoformate, 2.4 mmol;
ASBN catalyst, 0.05 g; at 120 °C for 3 h) were deployed for the
synthesis of various tetrazoles, and the outcomes are encapsulated
in Table 2.

To
examine the effects of diverse substituents, several 1-substituted
tetrazoles were prepared under solvent-free conditions emanating from
the reaction among assorted aryl amines containing electron-donating
and electron-retracting groups with sodium azide and triethyl orthoformate
in good to excellent yields.

The products were identified by
melting points, FT-IR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR;
The abolition of two strong and sharp absorption bands (NH2 stretching bands) and the emergence of bands in the region 1620–1680
cm–1 (C=N stretching band) in the FT-IR spectrum
affirmed the creation of 1-substituted 1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazoles
(Figure 9).29 The 1H NMR spectra of the products
showed one proton signal at δ = 7.80–8.40 ppm for the
tetrazole ring proton (Figure 10);2913C NMR
spectra exhibited one signal for the tetrazole carbon at δ =
∼141–157.2 ppm (Figure 11).29

The efficiency
of the present synthetic method was compared with reported protocols
for the synthesis of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazole
(Table 3);24,26,29,57−59 the documented
methods apparently have following drawbacks:(1) Tiresome work-up.

toxic, and explosive
reagent.

(3) Formation
of impurities and by-products after longer reaction times.

(4) Usage of column chromatography
for cleansing of the ensuing products.

(5) Use of homogeneous catalysts such as FeCl3, H2SO4, and trifluoromethanesulfonimide that
cannot be easily recycled and recovered.

(6) Difficulties in procurement of the natrolite
zeolite (entry 3).

(7) Use of organic solvents (entries 1, 2, and 5).

However,
none of the aforementioned disadvantages were observed
in our protocol wherein the ASBN catalyst was synthesized by deploying A. moluccana leaf extract as a renewable, nontoxic,
and natural resource for the reduction of ionic silver to Ag NPs.

Catalyst Recyclability
The stability
and recyclability of the ASBN catalyst were verified in the cycloaddition
reaction for the synthesis of tetrazoles. After the reaction was completed,
the ASBN catalyst was removed from the reaction medium by centrifugation,
rinsed with deionized water, dried in an oven, and then reclaimed
for the next cycle lacking any significant decrease in catalytic activity.
As shown in Scheme 4, the catalyst could be used, with unswerving activity, still after
five cycles. The EDS, TEM, and FESEM analyses of the reprocessed catalyst
(after five cycles) revealed that particles retain their shape and
size without any obvious change in chemical composition and morphological
alterations (Figures 12–14).

QSAR Toolbox Prediction
for a Single Chemical
A wide range of chemical entities are
continuously released into
the environment from a variety of sources. These discharges and the
ensuing pollution of the atmosphere and the potential damage to existing
beings and humans cause risk to human health and the ecosystem.60 To effectively reduce this exposure by instigating
measures or substitutions, it is obligatory to recognize the chemical
releases of concern;61,62 the main reason should be grounded
on the probable undesirable impact of the chemicals rather than only
the emitted amount. Chemical risk identification may be means to obtain
the requisite information.63,64 The usage of quantitative
structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models for the appraisal
of chemicals may help accelerate the process exploration, specifically
for cases where investigational statistics are lacking; the QSAR model
is the co-relation between the chemical structure and biological activity
in a dataset of chemicals.65 The characteristics
of a chemical structure are obtained by a set of chemical descriptors
that are utilized to forecast feature of the chemical. Relative to
other data collection methods, QSARs are expeditious and have the
prospective to include diverse entities that are reliant on the model
domain. Additionally, the appraised facts, for example, by QSARs,
are expected to upsurge in significance as authorizations such as
the European Chemicals Agency promote the reduced use of animal testing.60,66 In this study, the QSAR method was explored to investigate the formation
plausibility of the synthesized chemicals in Table 2 and predict the effect of different functional
groups attached to the main structure for their toxicity hazard and
protein binding (Figure 15).

the prediction is created by the users. In this case, the results

Conclusions
The
Ag/sodium borosilicate nanocomposite
has been prepared via the reduction of Ag+ ions to Ag(0)
in attendance of A. moluccana leaf
extract, and the ensuing Ag NPs were immobilized under solvent-free
conditions on the sodium borosilicate glass surface. The FT-IR spectrum
of Ag NPs and leaf extract from A. moluccana demonstrated that flavonoids or polyphenols present in the leaf
extract were accountable for the bioreduction of Ag+ ions
rather than using conventional toxic and hazardous reducing agents,
namely, borohydrides or hydrazines. The thermally and chemically stable
catalyst displayed high catalytic activity as a green and economically
recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the preparation of 1-substituted
tetrazoles in good to excellent yields. The notable benefit of this
protocol is the use of an environmentally benign method for the preparation
of sodium borosilicate glass and Ag/sodium borosilicate nanocomposite,
thus eliminating deployment of dangerous reagents, organic solvents,
and homogeneous catalysts for the facile synthesis of tetrazoles.
Moreover, the Ag/sodium borosilicate nanocomposite can be recycled
several times without noteworthy deactivation in its catalytic prowess.
Additionally, protein binding and toxicity hazard considerations for
the ensuing 1-substituted tetrazoles were investigated via the QSAR
model.

Experimental Section
Instruments and Reagents
All high-purity
chemical reagents were purchased from Merck and Sigma-Aldrich without
further purification. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
was recorded by using a Spectrum One system (Perkin-Elmer) spectrometer
(Nicolet 370 FT/IR spectrometer, Thermo Nicolet), using KBr pellets.
The 1H NMR spectra were obtained by a Bruker Avance DPX
400 MHz spectrometer. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements
were performed using a Philips powder diffractometer type PW 1373
goniometer (Cu Kα = 1.5406 Å) to investigate the crystal
structures of the samples. The materialization of Ag NPs was evaluated
by UV–Visible spectral analysis on a double-beam spectrophotometer
(Hitachi, U-2900). The size and morphology of the Ag NPs were investigated
through transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips EM208) and
field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4700).
Elemental analysis of the ASBN was performed using energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) equipped in FESEM.

Preparation of A. moluccana Leaf
Extract
Forty grams of powdered dried leaves of the plant
was extracted by boiling in 300 mL of double-distilled water for 25
min at 80 °C. The aqueous extract was filtered and stored in
a refrigerator for subsequent use.

Biosynthesis of Ag NPs
Using A. moluccana Leaf Extract
The aqueous extract (10 mL) was added dropwise
to aqueous solution of AgNO3 (40 mL of 0.005 M) with continuous
stirring at 70 °C. After 10 min, the solution turned into a brown
suspension due to the excitation of surface plasmon resonance, thereby
reaffirming the generation of Ag NPs (as monitored by UV–Vis
spectroscopy). Then, the suspension was centrifuged (7000 rpm) for
25 min. The green synthesized nanoparticles have adequate stability
with no noteworthy alteration in the symmetry of the absorption peak
even after 15 days, presumably due to the protecting influence of
the adsorbed phytochemicals.

Preparation
of the Sodium Borosilicate Glass
Sodium borosilicate was
prepared by a simple method using 19 g of borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O) dispersed in distilled
water (200 mL) at 35 °C to make a homogeneous solution. Then,
sodium silicate (Na2SiO3, 50 g) was added to
distilled water (200 mL) and filtered to isolate the precipitated
silica. In the next step, both solutions were mixed to form a jelly-like
polymer under a slow reaction, which ultimately dried. Last, the product
is rinsed with distilled water to eliminate any excess ions.54

Biosynthesis
of the ASBN Using A. moluccana Leaf
Extract
For the greener synthesis of the ASBN, a mixture
containing sodium borosilicate glass (1.0 g) and A. moluccanaleaf extract (50 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 20 min.
Then, 50 mL of 0.003 M AgNO3 (99.99%) aqueous solution
was added dropwise to the above mixture solution with vigorous stirring
and heating. After stirring for 4 h, the prepared Ag/sodium borosilicate
nanocomposite was separated from the residual solution by filtration,
washed three times with water, and dried at 110 °C for 5 h in
an oven.

General Procedure for the
Preparation of 1-Substituted 1H-1,2,3,4-Tetrazoles
A mixture of amine (2 mmol), sodium azide (2 mmol), triethyl orthoformate
(2.4 mmol), and Ag/sodium borosilicate glass nanocomposite (0.05 g)
was taken and stirred at 120 °C for the suitable times (Table 2), with the progress
of the reaction being monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC).
After the reaction is completed, the reaction mixture was allowed
to reach room temperature, then thinned with cold water (5 mL), and
finally extricated with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL). The heterogeneous
catalyst was separated by filtration. The solution was rinsed with
water, dehydrated over dry MgSO4, filtered, concentrated,
and then crystallized from EtOAc-hexane to give different tetrazoles.
All synthesized compounds were known and characterized through spectral
analysis and melting points.29

QSAR Prediction
for Protein Binding and Toxicity
Hazard Considerations
The molecular structures were imported
in quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR), target
chemicals were set by drawing the molecule and finding the CAS number
(5378-52-9), and then the profilers were selected by ticking specific
background information such as protein binding groups (Figure 16) and toxic hazard groups (Figure 17). We utilized inventory
data from Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox), existing
commercial chemical substances (EINECS), METI Japan, the original
concept of the Chemical Substances Control Law (CSCL), and the diet
and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) databases.
We predicted the molecular structure by organic functional group subcategorization
through elimination of dissimilar analogues with respect to structural
functionalities. This subcategorization helps eliminate structurally
dissimilar analogues such as aromatic amines.
