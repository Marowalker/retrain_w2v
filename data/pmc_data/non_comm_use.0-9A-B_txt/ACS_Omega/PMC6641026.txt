In this article, triazolylidene-derived
N-heterocyclic olefins
(trNHOs) are designed using computational quantum tools, and their
potential to promote CO2 sequestration is tested and discussed
in detail. The low barrier heights related to the trNHO-mediated process
indicate that the tailored compounds are very promising for fast CO2 sequestration. The systematic analysis of the presence of
distinct substitutes at different N positions of the trNHO ring allows
us to rationalize their effect on the carboxylation process and reveal
the best N-substituted trNHO systems for CO2 sequestration
and improved trNHO carboxylates for faster CO2 capture/release.

Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, activation, and
catalytic transformation have attracted much attention in the last
years mainly because of its increasing concentration in the atmosphere
and its potential as a C1 source.1−5 However, the successful chemical incorporation of CO2 usually requires extreme reaction conditions because of its kinetic
and thermodynamic stability.1,2

There are a variety
of structurally different chemical systems
that are considered as catalytic mediators of CO2 transformations.4−6 In 2013, Lu and collaborators described7 the synthesis and characterization of a variety of N-heterocyclic
olefins (NHOs), which are able to sequestrate CO2 yielding
NHO carboxylates (NHO–CO2) (Scheme 1). The synthesized NHO–CO2 compounds were also efficient organocatalysts in further transformations.
Since then, both NHO and NHO–CO2 species have been
explored to promote different reactions.7−17

Scheme 1 CO2 Capture by NHO Yielding NHO–CO2 Adducts
Substitutions at N- and C-position
of the imidazolium ring influence
the carboxylation rate of NHO by CO2 and the NHO–CO2 stability.7,18 Therefore, the catalytic activities
of NHO and NHO–CO2 compounds can be modulated by
modifications in the NHO ring structure.

To date, all of the
explorations involving NHOs and CO2 capture, however, have
relied on NHOs derived from the imidazolylidene
structure, which prompted us to investigate the carboxylation process
and the related properties of NHOs and NHO–CO2 containing
the 1,2,4-triazolylidene (tr) ring. Figure 1 shows the general structure of the NHOs
derived from the imidazolylidene structure (generic NHO) and those
derived from the triazolylidene class, which is considered in the
present work (trNHO). N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) from the triazolylidene
family, for example, show remarkable activity in a varied range of
catalytic processes, and their catalytic reactivity and selectivity
are mainly governed by the presence of different N-aryl substituents.19−22

Figure 1 Overview
of the present study: generic structure of an imidazolylidene-derived
NHO (NHO), a triazolylidene-derived NHO (trNHO), reference NHO, reference
trNHO, and the explored substituents (R).

With all of this in mind, the present work uses
computational quantum
chemistry tools to analyze the structure and stability of free trNHOs
and their carboxylation reaction with CO2. This chemical
process provides a way to capture CO2 by yielding trNHO–CO2; hence, these carboxylates are key species in capturing/releasing
CO2. Moreover, as either NHOs or their carboxylates play
a role in a growing range of CO2 transformations, the exploration
of this trNHO class contributes to the development of new and suitable
organocatalysts to be used in CO2 incorporation transformations.

Methods
and Models
Computational Methods
Geometry optimizations and frequency
calculations of all chemical species were performed using the MP2
method23,24 along with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set.25,26 The solvation effects of CH2Cl2 (dichloromethane,
DCM), an usual solvent in the NHO-organocatalyzed CO2 reactions,
were included with the SMD (IEF-cPCM) method.27−29 This level
of theory is referred to as MP2(DCM)/6-31+G(d,p). The MP2(DCM)/6-31+G(d,p)
approach was tested for optimizations of a NHO–CO2 adduct in a chemical system chosen among those characterized by
Lu and collaborators.7 This level of theory
showed to be efficient and reliable to determine its structure. Details
and comparisons of the calculated and experimental structures are
given in Table S1. The nature of all structures,
as minima or transition states (TSs), was confirmed by calculating
and diagonalizing the matrix of the second derivatives of the energy
(Hessian); TSs are identified by only one imaginary frequency. Minimum
energy path30 (MEP) calculations were employed
to connect reactants to products using the GS2 algorithm31 with a range of step sizes from 0.01 to 0.50
(amu)1/2 a0. All of these calculations were
performed using the GAMESS-US32,33 program package.

The relative energies were improved by single-point energy (SP) calculations
using the domain-based local pair natural orbital-coupled cluster
method with single and double excitations and perturbative triple
corrections (DLPNO-CCSD(T)).34,35 For the DLPNO-CCSD(T)
calculations, the cc-pVTZ basis set and the correlation fitting auxiliary
basis set cc-pVTZ/C were used.36−39

As thermal corrections based on the harmonic
approximation are
prone to error,40 the DLPNO-CCSD(T) relative
energies include only zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE) obtained
from the MP2(DCM)/6-31+G(d,p) calculations. Hence, unless otherwise
specified, all relative energies discussed in the text are obtained
from EcorrectedDLPNO-CCSD(T), according to eq 1. For selected trNHO-mediated processes,
values of ΔGRXN and ΔG‡ are provided in Table S2. The corrected DLPNO-CCSD(T) energies, EcorrectedDLPNO-CCSD(T), were calculated by 1  where EMP2(DCM)/6-31+G(d,p) and ESPMP2/6-31+G(d,p) are electronic energies
in DCM and gas phase, respectively. Their difference corresponds to
a solvation correction to the ESPDLPNO-CCSD(T) electronic
energy. All DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations were carried out using ORCA.41

We applied the DF-RKS/PBE/def2-TZVP42−44 level of theory, with
the univ-JKFIT42 fitting basis set, to
perform the intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) analysis, as implemented
in IboView program,45 which allows us to
follow the electron flow along the reaction path.46 Additionally, a quantitative interpretation of bonding
can be done by assigning the electrons in a doubly occupied IBO to
individual atoms.47

To investigate
the nature and magnitude of the interactions between
the trNHO and CO2 moieties in the TSs, the Su–Li
energy decomposition analysis (Su–Li EDA)48 was performed at MP2/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory, and the
interaction terms are corrected for the basis set superposition error
(BSSE). All Su–Li EDA calculations were performed with GAMESS-US.
The total interaction energy, ΔEint, is decomposed into five energy terms: electrostatic (ΔEes), exchange (ΔEex), repulsion (ΔErep), polarization
(ΔEpol), and dispersion ΔEdisp 2  To further explore and visualize the noncovalent
interactions, the NCI (noncovalent interactions) method was applied.49,50 This approach localizes the noncovalent interactions between the
atoms and classifies them according to their strength and type. All
NCI computations were carried out with the NCI-Plot package51 using electronic densities from the MP2/6-31+G(d,p)
calculations.

Chemical Model Systems
Inspired
by the work of Lupton52 and Smith20 on the
study of N-substituents in NHC-mediated processes, we selected 11
distinct substituents to investigate. They are shown in Figure 1 and labeled as 1a–1k. The NHO and trNHO with both N2-methyl and N4-methyl units are the reference systems
(Figure 1).

First,
the effects of the 1a–1k substituents
at the N2 and N4 positions of trNHO were considered
separately: the 1a–1k groups were
considered at the N2 atom or at the N4, that
is, while varying the groups at N2, N4 remained
attached to the methyl group as it is in the reference system and
vice versa. In sequence, the combined effect of some substituents
was further explored.

Results and Discussion
This section
is organized as follows: first, a detailed comparison
of the CO2 sequestration performed by the reference systems,
NHO and trNHO (Figure 1), is presented; next, the effects of N-substituents on the carboxylation
process within the trNHO class is discussed; finally, the combined
effect of selected substituents is described and the optimal trNHO
systems are presented.

CO2 Capture Mechanism by the Reference
NHO and trNHO
Systems
The energy profile for the carboxylation process
between each reference system and CO2 is shown in Figure 2. Along this work,
the labels containing subscripts vdw, TS, and add refer to van der Waals complexes, TSs, and
adducts, respectively.

Figure 2 Relative energy profiles of the NHO + CO2 and
trNHO
+ CO2 carboxylation processes obtained using the EcorrectedDLPNO-CCSD(T) energies and NCI analysis using its color
scale: green for weak interactions, red for strong nonbonded overlaps,
and blue for strong attractive interactions; all energies are given
in kcal mol–1 with respect to the separated reactants.

In addition, M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p)53 calculations
were used to assess the nucleophilicity of the free trNHO and NHO
systems using the nucleophilicity index (N) defined
by N = EHOMO(Nu) (eV)
– EHOMO(TCE) (eV), with Nu = NHO, trNHO, and tetracyanoethylene (TCE) as reference,
as described by Domingo and co-authors.54 The density functionals (DFs), M06-2X, B3LYP-D3,55,56 and wB97X-D57−60 were applied for some of our trNHO carboxylation processes, and
their overall trend is in line with the current DLPNO-CCSD(T) discussions.
More details are given in Table S3. The
Mulliken charge analysis shows that the charge of the CNHOα and CtrNHOα are
practically the same (−0.609 and −0.611, respectively).
According to the nucleophilicity index, these free species are strong
nucleophiles (N ≥ 3.9 eV)61 with NNHO = 5.3 eV and NtrNHO = 4.7 eV.

Both reactions start with
the formation of a van der Waals complex, NHOvdW and trNHOvdW, both at −1.0 kcal mol–1 in the explored
potential energy surface. The NHOvdW and trNHOvdW systems
are predicted to have a singlet electronic ground
state; their triplet electronic states are 91.9 and 91.7 kcal mol–1 (MP2(DCM)/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory) higher in
energy, respectively.

We note that this CO2 transformation
process should
be faster using the NHO system. However, the activation energy barrier,
ΔE‡, of the trNHO-mediated
process is only 2.3 kcal mol–1 higher. Therefore,
the new trNHO system is a suitable chemical system for CO2 sequestration as good as their counterpart NHOs. Both carboxylation
reactions are exoergic.

The NHO–CO2 adduct,
with a Cα–CCO2 bond
length of 1.57 Å, is
more stable than trNHOadd by 6.0 kcal mol–1, in which the just formed C–C bond is slightly
longer, 1.58 Å. Lu and co-workers7 pointed out that, in general, NHO–CO2 species
with longer Cα–CCO2 bond
distances are decarboxylated more easily, and the length of the Cα–CCO2 bond is correlated
to the catalytic activity. Moreover, they observed that the length
of the CNHCα–CCO2 bond is significantly shorter,
in the range of 1.52–1.53 Å,62−64 than that of
the CNHOα–CCO2 bond (1.55–1.60 Å),
and that the reactivity of NHO–CO2 systems toward
nucleophile-promoted reactions was superior. More details about their
optimized geometric parameters are seen in Supporting Information.

The CO2 sequestration by trNHO
and NHO was carried out
using the NCI (Figure 2) and IBO (Figure 3) approaches. With the color scale adopted by the NCI analysis, we
can visualize and identify the type of interaction present: green
indicates weak interactions such as dispersion forces; red is used
for strong nonbonded overlaps, and blue stands for strong attractive
interactions. Both the NHOvdW and trNHOvdW systems exhibit
extended green regions, indicating how important are noncovalent interactions
to drive the reaction. In the NHOts and trNHOts species,
the blue area indicates a strong interaction, that is, the formation
of the C–C bond. For the adducts, the green area is reduced,
and weak forces are present between the oxygen atoms of CO2 and respective rings.

Figure 3 Six active IBOs for the NHO- and trNHO-mediated
processes; electron
pairs are IBOs of the same color. The active IBO that changed the
most along the reaction path, numbered as 1, has its fraction of electrons
assigned to individual atoms shown in parentheses.

Following the active IBOs along the reaction path,
a detailed mechanism
in terms of curly arrows can be derived. More details about the theory
is given elsewhere,45−47 and here we retain ourselves to the interpretation
of results. Six active IBOs were seen to change their nature during
the reaction, which are displayed in Figure 3. The IBO that changes the most along the
reaction path is identified as 1 in Figure 3. For this IBO, we show in parentheses the
fraction of electrons assigned to the individual atoms. Following
IBO 1 in both types of mediated process, we see that the π bond
between C3 and C6 turns into a new σ bond,
which is mainly composed of C6 and CCO2 atoms; the C3 has a small contribution of 0.056
(0.063) electrons for this new C–C bond in NHO–CO2 (trNHO–CO2) systems. It is interesting
to note how the C6–CCO2 bond
formation in the TSs is translated by the NCI and the IBO approaches:
NCI indicating a stronger interaction between C6 and CCO2 in blue and IBO indicating the bond formation
by changes in the fraction of electrons seen between these atoms.

Effect of N-Substituents on CO2 Capture
Next,
changes in the activation energy barriers (ΔE‡) and reaction energies (ΔERXN) resulting from the presence of different groups at
N2 and N4 positions of the trNHO ring were analyzed.
A similar analysis for the NHO system was not performed, as it has
been done in detail by Dong and collaborators.18 The goal of the current step is to rationalize, for the
first time, how we can modulate the energetics of CO2 capture
in trNHO-mediated processes by varying the N-substituents of the triazolium
ring.

To do the comparison, we use as reference NHO and trNHO
with methyl groups at both N2 and N4 positions.
First, the effect of substituents on trNHO was considered separately
at N2 and N4 positions, that is, by varying
the groups at N2 from 1a to 1k with a methyl group at N4 and then varying the groups
at N4 with a methyl group at N2. The results
of this first step are summarized in Table 1. For completeness, the values of ΔE‡ and ΔERXN for the reference systems are also given in Table 1. The combined effect of changing the groups
attached at N2 and N4 was explored further with
substituents that reduced the barrier the most.

1j	6.0	–5.4	4.6	–10.9	
1k	6.5	–5.1	5.9	–7.0	
a The relative energies were obtained
using the EcorrectedDLPNO-CCSD(T) values.

According to our calculations, all
of the explored CO2 fixation processes are exoergic. Substituents 1f and 1g lead to less stable carboxylates, regardless
of the position
(N2 or N4), with decarboxylation barriers in
the range of 9.3–10.7 kcal mol–1. The most
exoergic process (ΔERXN) involves
the group 1j attached at the N4 position.
Substitutions at the N4 atom are more effective in stabilizing
the adducts than substitutions made at N2. Therefore, improved
carboxylates for CO2 storage might be better tailored by
changing the groups at N4.

Groups 1f and 1g are responsible for
the largest activation barriers (ΔE‡ > 7.0 kcal mol–1) for substitutions carried
out
at the N4 atom. Among the N2 set, groups 1c, 1d, 1f, and 1g follow
this same trend. According to the ΔE‡ values in Table 1, the fastest trNHO-mediated process should be observed when the
−CH3 group is replaced by the −C(CH3)3 (1e) group for functionalizations at N2; at N4, this is accomplished using the methoxyaryl
group 1i. In addition, the replacement of the methyl
group at N4 by 1a, 1b, 1e, 1i, or 1j also results in activation
barriers with a lower energy than the reference value (5.5 kcal mol–1).

Next, we are interested in the nature and
magnitude of the interaction
energies between the trNHO and CO2 moieties in all of the
TSs related to the carboxylation process mediated by a particular
N-substituted trNHO species. To do that, the Su–Li EDA analysis
was performed. The main goal is to identify the relative contributions
of the individual energy terms to the stabilization/destabilization
of TSs and, hence, the terms that most affect the rate of reaction.
Moreover, such decomposition analysis might be extrapolated to also
shed some light on the relative stability of van der Waals complexes
and adducts.

In addition, distortion energy (ΔEdist), the energy necessary to distort the fragment
to that in the TS
geometry, is also listed. Distortion energies for the CO2 and the many N-substituted trNHO fragments in the TS geometry are
ΔEdist(CO2) and ΔEdist(trNHO), respectively. The addition of reactant distortion energies and
the ΔEint term provides a value
that correlates better with ΔE‡.65 The results are summarized in Table 2. Along the discussion
that follows, the chemical systems are named using labels that contain
the identification of the group (1a–1k) and the position where it is attached (N2 or N4).

a For completeness, the activation
energy barrier (ΔE‡) is also
included. The listed values are in kcal mol–1.

The trNHOTS-1e-N2 species, which is the TS associated
to the fastest carboxylation
reaction (ΔE‡ = 4.5 kcal
mol–1) among the N2 systems set, shows
the lowest reactant distortion energy (ΔEdist = ΔEdist(CO2) + ΔEdist(trNHO) = 9.2 kcal mol–1) and repulsion interaction energy
(ΔErep = 94.2 kcal mol–1), while the slowest process has the largest ΔErep (123.3 kcal mol–1); it is also true
that this latter species also exhibits the highest ΔEdist. Indeed, all of the fluoroaryl substituents
at N2 have the largest distortion energies and ΔErep.

Within the N4 systems
set, the structure with the largest
ΔEdist and ΔErep is trNHOTS-1f-N4; it is related to the carboxylation reaction
with the slowest rate. Among the TSs with ΔE‡ < 5.0 kcal mol–1, a unique
trend is not seen, which suggests that there is more than one way
to stabilize the TS. The trNHOTS-1e-N4 appears to take advantage of a small
ΔEdist to provide a TS, which is
only 4.3 kcal mol–1 higher in energy than its reactants,
whereas the other two need larger stabilizing energy terms, mainly
the polarization and exchange energies, to counterbalance their higher
ΔEdist.

Improving the trNHO Systems
In the present subsection,
the effects of the simultaneous replacement of both −CH3 groups at N2 and N4 positions are investigated.
Assuming that an additive effect of the N-substituents groups would
be observed, those that reduced the activation barrier the most, ΔE‡ < 5.0 kcal mol–1, were selected. For all investigated structures, group 1e was fixed at N2 as it was the only group within this
set that provided the desired barrier lowering. Among the N4 systems set, groups 1e, 1i, and 1j were chosen to be explored (see Table 1). Therefore, our current model systems always
have 1e attached to N2; however, they differ
as the groups bonded to the N4 atom, which is 1e, 1i, or 1j, labeled as trNHO-1e-N2-1e-N4, trNHO-1e-N2-1i-N4, and trNHO-1j-N2-1e-N4, respectively, and their optimized structures
are given in Figure 4. The idea behind this protocol is to tailor better N-substituted
trNHO systems for faster CO2 sequestration and/or provide
more stable carboxylates, which are responsible for CO2 storage.

Figure 4 Relative energy profiles for the carboxylation process of (A) trNHO-1e-N2-1j-N4, (B) trNHO-1e-N2-1i-N4, and (C) trNHO-1e-N2-1e-N4. For completeness, the
energetic of the reaction between the reference system, trNHO, and
CO2 is also indicated in (D). The energies are obtained
using the EcorrectedDLPNO-CCSD(T) values and are given in
kcal mol–1 with respect to the separated reactants.

Figure 4 also presents
the MEPs for the mediated reactions; for completeness, the energetic
of the reaction between the reference system, trNHO, and CO2 is also indicated. All of the new redesigned trNHO systems show
faster carboxylation than the reference system. The major improvements
are seen with respect to the stabilization of the carboxylates systems.
All carboxylates are now more stable than the trNHO–CO2 reference. The trNHOs trNHO-1e-N2-1i-N4 and trNHO-1e-N2-1j-N4 yield carboxylates
with energies of −12.0 and −11.7 kcal mol–1, respectively, with respect to their reactants. These values are
even better than that described for the trNHO-1j-N4 system (−10.9 kcal mol–1, Table 1) and closer to the
NHO–CO2 value.

To follow the C–C bond
formation between CO2 and
trNHO systems, the IBO related to it is shown in Figure 5. The van der Waals complexes,
TSs, and adducts associated to the carboxylation process of trNHO-1e-N2-1e-N4, trNHO-1e-N2-1j-N4, and trNHO-1e-N2-1i-N4 are displayed.

Figure 5 IBO related to C–C
bond formation between CO2 and trNHO systems; the fractions
of electrons assigned to individual
atoms are shown in parentheses. The carbon atoms are labeled as indicated
in Figure 3.

In all of the van der Waals complexes,
the electrons of the π
bond between C3 and C6 are mainly localized
at C6. The carbon atoms are labeled as indicated in Figure 3. In the trNHOvdW-1e-N2-1e-N4 system, the fraction of electrons in C6 is higher
than that in the trNHOvdW-1e-N2-1i-N4 and trNHOvdW-1e-N2-1j-N4 species. This former van der Waals complex is the most stable one;
hence, such polarization appears to contribute with such stabilization,
even though its reacting fragments are separated by 3.42 Å. More
details about their structures are given in the Supporting Information. A similar trend is observed along
the TSs of these systems. Their C6–CCO2 bond lengths were found to be 2.39, 2.29, and 2.29
Å for trNHOTS-1e-N2-1e-N4, trNHOTS-1e-N2-1i-N4, and trNHOTS-1e-N2-1i-N4, respectively. When the reaction is complete, a new
C–C bond is formed. There are contributions of C3, C6, and CCO2 to this new σ
bond. The three adducts have the same C6–CCO2 bond length (1.57 Å), which is comparable to our
reference trNHO–CO2 (1.58 Å) and NHO–CO2 (1.57 Å) values. Hence, the adduct stability and decarboxylation
energy are not exclusively dependent on the this bond distance.

In Figure 6, the
differences in the components of interaction energy and distortion
energy of the TSs related to trNHOTS-1e-N2-1e-N4, trNHOTS-1e-N2-1i-N4, and trNHOTS-1e-N2-1j-N4 with respect to the reference
system trNHOTS are presented.

Figure 6 Differences in the components
of the interaction energy and distortion
energy for TSs trNHOTS-1e-N2-1e-N4, trNHOTS-1e-N2-1i-N4, and trNHOTS-1e-N2-1j-N4 with respect to the reference system trNHOTS. X = es, ex, rep, pol, disp, int, and dist.

It is clear that the repulsion
term, which arises from the partially
overlapping electron densities of the interacting reacting fragments,
has an impact on the energy of the TSs: the ΔErep of trNHOTS-1e-N2-1e-N4, the lowest-energy TS,
is smaller than that of trNHOTS; the opposite
behavior is seen in the other two TSs. Large distortions lead to larger
barriers; for trNHOTS-1e-N2-1e-N4, the distortion energy is kept
below the reference system as well as its energy.

Overall, a
lowering of the TS energy can be mainly attributed to
a combination of favorable exchange and orbital polarization interactions
and a low distortion energy and repulsion interaction between the
reacting systems. The polarization interaction and exchange terms,
in particular, can be related to the IBO shown in Figure 5. ΔEpol refers to an orbital relaxation energy arising from
the bond formation, polarization, and charge-transfer processes, whereas
ΔEex represents the stabilizing
interaction due to the exchange of electrons between the monomers.
During the formation of a new σ C–C bond, the orbitals
change significantly; trNHOTS-1e-N2-1i-N4 and trNHOTS-1e-N2-1j-N4 have larger fractions of electrons being transferred among
C3, C6, and CCO2 and hence
larger ΔEpol and ΔEex terms compared to those of trNHOTS. However, the superior values of polarization, exchange
interactions, and other stabilizing terms in trNHOTS-1e-N2-1i-N4 and trNHOTS-1e-N2-1j-N4 are not enough to better compensate
the CO2 distortion and ΔErep. Therefore, a trade-off between ΔEpol + ΔEex and ΔEdist + ΔErep is important
in designing trNHO systems for a faster CO2 capture.

Conclusions
In the present study, new trNHOs systems were
designed using computational
chemistry. Their ability to capture CO2 is comparable to
that of its NHO counterpart. The reference trNHO–CO2 is less stable than the reference NHO–CO2, and
its decarboxylation energy barrier is 3.7 kcal mol–1 lower than that of NHO–CO2; therefore, the trNHO
adduct releases CO2 more easily.

The presence of
different substituents at different N positions
of the trNHO ring can favor either a faster carboxylation or a more
stable adduct. Sole substitutions at the N4 atom are more
effective in stabilizing the adducts than the respective one made
at the N2 position; therefore, N4-functionalized
systems should be better for CO2 storage; among the discussed
systems, trNHO-containing methoxyaryl can be a good choice. On the
other hand, if free trNHO catalysts are the choice and CO2 has to be released, those containing fluoroaryl groups might be
a better system.

To result in even faster carboxylation/decarboxylation
processes
and more stable adducts, a combined substitution at the N2 and N4 positions of the trNHO ring can be made. An additive
effect, which might be expected, of the substitution of both N2 and N4 was not observed. The lowering of the energy
barrier can be accomplished by a combination of favorable exchange
and orbital polarization interactions and a low distortion energy
and repulsion interaction between the reacting systems. More stable
carboxylates, better systems for CO2 storage, can be tailored
by the functionalization using methoxyaryl groups at N4 and the −C(CH3)3 substituent at N2.
