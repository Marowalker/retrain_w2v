An
in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure (in situ EXAFS)
spectroscopic analysis at high temperature was conducted to investigate
the mechanism of Cs removal from weathered biotite (WB) from Fukushima,
induced by heating with a mixed salt of NaCl and CaCl2.
This indicated that most Cs remained in WB during heating at 200–700
°C. In addition, the in situ EXAFS spectra gradually changed
on heating with the mixed salt and a completely different spectrum
was observed for the sample after cooling from 700 °C to room
temperature (RT). Ex situ EXAFS measurements and X-ray fluorescence
analyses were also conducted on samples after heat treatment and removal
of the mixed salt to clarify the temperature dependence of the Cs
removal ratio. On the basis of the results of radial structure function
analysis obtained from in situ EXAFS, we concluded that almost all
of the Cs was removed from WB by heating at 700 °C with the mixed
salt, and that Cs formed Cs–Cl bonds after cooling to RT from
700 °C. In contrast, although more than half of the Cs present
was removed from WB by heat treatment at 500 °C, most Cs was
surrounded by silica tetrahedrons, maintained by Cs–O bonds.
On the basis of these results, different Cs removal processes are
suggested for the high-temperature (600–700 °C) and low-temperature
(400–500 °C) regions.

Introduction
Following the accident at the Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant
on March 11, 2011, many fission products, including 134Cs and 137Cs, were released into the air and distributed
over a wide area around the northern Kanto and Tohoku regions (especially
Fukushima) of Japan; soil contamination by radioactive materials is
still a significant problem.1−8137Cs represents a particularly significant hazard because
this isotope has a half-life of approximately 30 years and strongly
adheres to soil particles, especially clay minerals. Consequently, 137Cs contamination is primarily observed within the upper
5 cm of affected soils;9 huge amounts of
contaminated soils were gathered and accumulated at many temporary
storage sites. Although volume reduction of the contaminated soil
is an important social problem, a standard Cs removal method has not
been established for soil.

In Fukushima, as is well known, Cs
is selectively and strongly
sorbed in a specific clay mineral known as weathered biotite (WB),
which forms a significant fraction of soils.10−12 WB, one of
the most common clay minerals in the soil in Fukushima, occurs as
a mixed layer structure comprising biotite from the Abukuma granite
and vermiculite formed by weathering.13 Recent studies have shown that compared with biotite, illite, smectite,
kaolinite, halloysite, allophane, and imogolite Cs is more selectively
sorbed in WB in Fukushima soil.14 Therefore,
WB is one of the most important topics in research on Cs sorption
in Fukushima.

A method for the sublimation of Cs using heat
treatment was previously
examined15 for the removal of Cs from clay
minerals, such as WB and soil. Normal heat treatment up to 1300 °C
fixes Cs onto silicate to form a stable silicate mineral without any
radioactivity loss; however, heat treatment with certain types of
alkali salts enhances Cs removal.15 Spalding
reported a reduction of more than 99% in radioactivity by adding NaCl
and limestone to Cs-contaminated soil and heating it to a temperature
above 1000 °C.16 Shimoyama et al.
added NaCl and CaCl2 (NaCl–CaCl2) mixed
salts to Cs-sorbed WB, conducted heat treatment in a low-pressure
environment at 650 °C accompanied by aqueous cleaning of the
sample, and then performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis.
They reported that the Cs 3d peak corresponding to nonradioactive
Cs almost disappeared.17 The results of
these previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of heat treatment
with alkali salts in the removal of Cs from WB.

Although the
above-mentioned high-temperature heat treatments are
effective Cs removal methods, their high cost is problematic; thus,
it is desirable to keep the treatment temperature as low as possible.
Factors that influence the Cs desorption temperature are the type
of clay mineral, eutectic points of the alkali salts, ionic radii
of the salts, and pressure. There are few previous studies investigating
correlations between these factors, and details of the desorption
mechanism are still not completely understood.18,19 Investigation of the mechanism is necessary to enable more effective
combinations and ratios of alkali salts to be proposed for this heat-treatment
method. It is important to note that Shimoyama et al. reported Cs
removal at a much lower temperature (650 °C) than that used in
the study by Spalding (above 1000 °C); however, to our knowledge,
no direct observation has been reported for the process of Cs desorption
from clay minerals by heat treatment.

In this study, an extended
X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
spectroscopic analysis of Cs-sorbed WB was conducted. Using EXAFS,
it is possible to observe particular solid phases, such as clay minerals,
in multicomponent systems using the element selectivity arising from
inner-shell excitation.20−22 This method is advantageous for
obtaining information on local structural changes involving Cs, which
is not possible via methods that identify changes in the crystal structure,
for example, X-ray diffraction analysis. To investigate the effect
of molten alkali salts on clay minerals, we added a NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt to the studied samples, conducted in situ EXAFS
measurements at 200–700 °C, and then compared the differences
in the spectra with and without the alkali salt. We also conducted
ex situ EXAFS measurement and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopic
analysis on samples from which the alkali salt had been removed after
heat treatment to determine the temperature dependence of the Cs removal
ratio. Finally, on the basis of the obtained Cs removal ratio and
the results of in situ EXAFS in this study, we concluded that different
Cs desorption processes occur in the temperature ranges of 400–500
and 600–700 °C.

Results and Discussion
We first
compared the pure WB sample with that containing both
WB and the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt using Cs K edge
EXAFS measurements. The red and black curves in Figure 1, respectively, show the Cs K edge EXAFS
spectra of the WB sample (A) and the WB–NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt sample (B) before heating. The two spectra have
similar shapes at the peaks labeled a, b, and c. This means that the
Cs in WB is not influenced by the addition of the mixed salt at room
temperature (RT).

Figure 1 Cs K edge EXAFS spectra for (A) WB + NaCl–CaCl2 at RT and (B) only WB at RT before heating.

We then investigated the effect of the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt addition on the EXAFS spectra at high temperatures. Figure 2a,b shows EXAFS spectra
of samples (A) and (B) at high temperatures, respectively: the black,
lilac, blue, pink, purple, indigo, and red curves correspond to the
results for temperatures of 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 °C,
respectively. The green curves represent the EXAFS spectra obtained
after cooling to RT from 700 °C. The insets show three typical
spectra: at RT, on heating to 700 °C, and after cooling.

Figure 2 Cs K edge EXAFS
spectra of WB samples (a) without and (b) with
NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salts. Different colors correspond
to results at different temperatures: RT (black), 200 °C (lilac),
300 °C (blue), 400 °C (pink), 500 °C (purple), 600
°C (indigo), 700 °C (red), and after cooling (green).

The WB sample spectral shapes
were almost the same in all cases
(Figure 2a). Indeed,
the spectra showed only slight differences, as observed in the insets
of Figure 2. This result
indicates that, as the temperature increased, the amplitude of the
fine structure gradually decreased. As temperature increases, atomic
vibrations have larger amplitudes and the Debye–Waller factor
is proportional to temperature. Therefore, we consider that the local
structure of Cs did not change under these conditions; in fact, after
cooling, the spectrum returned to its original shape, that is, that
before heating.

In contrast, for the case of the sample of WB
and NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt (Figure 2b inset), the spectra at RT, 700 °C,
and after cooling
show that an irreversible change occurred. With the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt, the heating contribution is much more evident,
and the fine structures at the edge exhibit much broader features
as the temperature reaches 700 °C. After cooling, the spectrum
did not return to its original shape. This result indicates that the
local structure of Cs in WB was changed by heat treatment with the
NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt.

We therefore performed
EXAFS analysis of the Cs K edge spectra
to understand the local structure around Cs in both samples. EXAFS
analysis was successfully conducted in the past to reveal the local
structure of Cs-sorbed WB.23 The EXAFS
data were analyzed here using WinXAS ver. 3.2 developed
by Ressler24 and FEFF 8.40
developed by Zabinsky.25 The k3-weighted χ(k) spectra of Cs K
edge EXAFS for samples (A) and (B) are shown in Figure 3a,b, respectively.

Figure 3 Cs K edge EXAFS spectra
for Cs-sorbed samples. (a, b) k3-weighted
χ(k) spectra for samples
(A) and (B), respectively. (c, d) Corresponding radial structure functions
(RSFs) obtained from (a) and (b), respectively.

The χ(k) function weighed by k3 was Fourier transformed to obtain an RSF26 with a k-range of less than
8 Å–1. This k-range was chosen
because the influence of noise was more significant above 8 Å–1 in the case of sample (B). Structural parameters,
such as the intrinsic distance, the coordination number, and the Debye–Waller
factor, were obtained by least-squares fittings in the k-space.26 In this report, we focused on
changes in the bond pairs and positions; these parameters were only
used for identification of these factors.

For the case of sample
(A), the amplitude of the EXAFS function
was proportional to temperature, but the vibration period was similar
for all temperatures. The spectrum returned to its original shape
after cooling from a high temperature to RT. This suggests that most
Cs remained in the silicate when WB was heated to 700 °C in air
without the alkaline salt. In sample (B), the amplitude of the EXAFS
function was almost the same up to 400 °C; however, above 500
°C, it became smaller. Furthermore, the spectral shape changed
significantly after cooling from 700 °C to RT, indicating that
the heat treatment changed the local structure around Cs.

Two
main peaks are observed at 2.0 and 3.4 Å before heating
(Figure 3c). Regarding
the local structure of Cs in WB, it is suggested that Cs+ ions are strongly sorbed at the siloxane ditrigonal cavity (SDC)
sites in micaceous clay minerals, such as WB. On the basis of the
adsorption model at the SDC site, the peak at 2.0 Å is attributed
to Cs–O pairs, and the peak at 3.4 Å is attributed to
Cs–Si pairs.21 The Cs–O peak
appeared at almost the same position from 200 to 700 °C, and
we observed a small increase in distance after cooling. Although the
origin of the peak shift is not clear, we consider that most Cs remained
at the SDC sites because the Cs–Si peak was observed at almost
the same distance before and after heat treatment. Therefore, we infer
that Cs was not removed from WB by only heating at 700 °C in
air. These results are consistent with those of previous studies.17

In contrast, we observed a different tendency
of the RSF for sample
(B). Focusing only on the first peak at the bottom of Figure 3d, the addition of the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt induced a shift toward the higher distance end
at 500 °C. This means that the local structure around Cs was
modified by the influence of the salt at high temperatures. In the
500 °C spectrum, the shift of the first peak corresponded to
a change in interaction between the Cs+ ions and the silica
layers in WB. As the temperature approached 700 °C, we observed
that the bond length of the first peak increased. This implies that
a portion of Cs desorbed from WB and was eluted in the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt. Therefore, a coordination structural change around
Cs was indicated. We cannot, however, estimate how much Cs was removed
from WB after heat treatment with the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt because in situ EXAFS analysis gives only average information
for all Cs atoms.

We therefore estimated the Cs removal ratio
using ex situ EXAFS
and XRF measurements. Figure 4a shows the ex situ EXAFS spectra at the Cs K edge after removing
the salt by water rinsing; the black, red, blue, pink, and green curves
correspond to the results before heating and after heating at 400,
500, 600, and 700 °C, respectively. A strong edge jump was observed
before heating, and its intensity decreased with heating temperature
because eluted Cs in the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt was
rinsed away with water. In fact, no edge jump was observed for heating
at 700 °C. This result suggests that 99.8% (almost 100%) Cs was
removed from WB after heat treatment with the mixed salt.

Figure 4 (a) Ex situ
EXAFS spectra at the Cs K edge after removal of the
alkaline salt by water rinsing: the black, red, blue, pink, and green
curves correspond to the results before heating and after heating
at 400, 500, 600, and 700 °C, respectively. (b) Relationship
between relative edge jump and Cs remaining in WB, as determined from
XRF analysis.

In Figure 4b, the
black squares represent the relative intensities of the Cs edge jump
obtained from the ex situ EXAFS measurements as a function of the
heating temperature. Here, the edge jump data for particular temperatures
are normalized to a value of unity for the sample before heating.
The shaded bars show the relative amounts of Cs remaining in the sample
obtained from XRF measurements as a percentage of the amount of Cs
present before heating. XRF analysis clarified that the amount of
Cs in the sample decreased by 56, 61, 89, and 100% at 400, 500, 600,
and 700 °C, respectively. As shown in Figure 4b, both ex situ EXAFS and XRF values showed
similar tendencies. This indicates that the in situ EXAFS spectrum
of sample (A) after cooling originated from Cs eluted in the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt; the first peak in the RSF of Figure 3d is therefore attributed to
the presence of Cs–Cl bonds.

Here, we discuss the Cs
removal process by comparing the Cs removal
ratio based on the in situ EXAFS analyses. As previously noted, these
results for sample (B) indicated that Cs in WB produced a Cs–O
structure at 400 °C; however, as already inferred from XRF analysis,
56% of the Cs was removed from the WB with the salt at 400 °C
after washing the sample with water. Consequently, the in situ EXAFS
spectrum obtained at 400 °C contained both Cs remaining in WB
and eluted in the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt; however,
Cs in WB is maintained in a Cs–O structure in the 400 °C
heating process.

In contrast, in situ EXAFS clarified that the
bond length of the
first peak in RSF gradually increased above 500 °C, and XRF analysis
showed that the Cs removal ratio increased as this peak shifted to
the longer side. The layered silicate structure in WB was thus gradually
dissolved by the influence of the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed
salt, and the ratio of Cs–Cl bonds to Cs–O bonds increased
with temperature.

This interpretation means that both Cs–O
and Cs–Cl
bonds contributed to the first peak in the RSF of Figure 3d; therefore, it is important
to distinguish these in the RSF. A previous EXAFS analysis reported
that the Cs–Cl bond length was 2.9 Å at RT and 2.4 Å
at 700 °C.27 In EXAFS analysis, it
is known that the distance shortens as the temperature increases.
Furthermore, the 2.9 Å position seems closer to that of hydrated
cesium (Cs–O), but the electron density around the scattering
Cs atoms is quite different when comparing Cl with O: in this case,
the electron density of Cl is higher than that of O. In addition,
a comparison of standard samples with CsCl and NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salts was conducted, which confirmed that the 2.9 Å
position agreed with that of the Cs–Cl distance. This bond
shortening at 700 °C resulted from a phase transition from the
crystal to the molten salt form because the melting point of CsCl
is approximately 645 °C.28 Hence,
it is hypothesized that the Cs–Cl bond length would shift from
2.9 to 2.4 Å with increasing temperature and that the bond length
would be close to 2.9 Å below the melting point. We consider
that the first peak at 400 °C in the RSF of Figure 3d should not be attributed
to the Cs–Cl bond, but to the Cs–O bond, for two reasons:
the first is that the eutectic point of the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt was confirmed using differential thermal analysis to
be 504 °C, which is higher than 400 °C; the second reason
is that the bond length for the first peak (2.0 Å) is much shorter
than the Cs–Cl bond length in the solid state (2.9 Å).
Therefore, if half of the Cs present was eluted in the mixed salt
at 400 °C, we would observe a Cs–Cl peak around 2.9 Å.
We assume that the same would also be partially true at 500 °C
because the bond length of the first peak was 2.1 Å at 500 °C
in the RSF of Figure 3d; however, we consider that a portion of the Cs may be eluted in
the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt above 600 °C because
the bond length increased to 2.4 Å at 600 and 700 °C.

Considering all of the above, we propose the existence of at least
two Cs removal processes: a process dominant in the high-temperature
region above 600 °C and another dominant in the low-temperature
region below 500 °C.

In the high-temperature process, Cs
is released and eluted in the
mixed salt through the heating process. We think that the ratio of
the extents of the high-temperature to the low-temperature process
gradually increases with temperature because the first peak in RSF
approaches the Cs–Cl bond length at higher temperatures, as
observed in Figure 3d.

In the low-temperature process, we suggest a hypothesis
that Cs
is surrounded by silica tetrahedrons during heating but is released
from the silicate structure through the cooling process. This implies
that some change in the layered silicate structure occurs during the
cooling process in the presence of the alkaline salt. In fact, water
molecules formed during the dehydroxylation of biotite might temporarily
increase its d-spacing, which would accelerate the
cation-exchange reactions between interlayer Cs, Na, and Ca. With
regard to the process by which Cs is removed from WB, we investigated
the influence of water washing without heat treatment to avoid possible
incorrect interpretation of Cs removal results. To confirm this, a
well-stirred sample of WB with the mixed salts was washed with water
and then subjected to XRF analysis. This showed that there was no
change in the Cs remaining in the sample, which indicated that the
washing step by itself did not influence the Cs removal process. It
is not a coincidence that the observation of a change in Cs coordination
occurred at temperatures of 500–700 °C.

These insights
may be helpful in improving our method of Cs decontamination
from soil. We will investigate the low- and high-temperature processes
in more detail by measuring in situ EXAFS, not only for the heating
process but also for the cooling process, in future work. If the low-temperature
process dominates at 500 °C, we can expect some hysteresis of
the in situ EXAFS spectra between the heating process up to 500 °C
and the cooling process above 500 °C. Furthermore, we plan to
study the role of alkaline salts in future work. If the hysteresis
of the in situ EXAFS spectra depends on the presence of alkaline salts,
this information would give us important clues with respect to choosing
particular alkaline salts as reagents for Cs decontamination.

In our present study, we investigated the local structure of Cs
sorbed in WB using in situ and ex situ EXAFS measurements at the Cs
K edge to study the Cs removal process from this clay mineral by heating
from 200 to 700 °C. The results of in situ EXAFS clarified that
most of the Cs remained in WB during the heating. In contrast, we
observed that the in situ EXAFS spectra gradually changed on heating
with a NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt; a completely different
spectrum was observed for the sample after cooling from 700 °C
to RT. Ex situ EXAFS spectra were measured for Cs-sorbed WB after
heat treatment with the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt and
rinsing the salt from the sample with water; the edge jump of the
ex situ EXAFS spectra decreased with temperature, indicating increasing
Cs removal from WB and its elution in the NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt. Cs removal ratios were estimated for the samples based
on XRF measurements; they exhibited a similar tendency to that of
the decrease in the edge jump of ex situ EXAFS spectra. On the basis
of the Cs removal ratios and the RSF analysis obtained from in situ
EXAFS with the salt, we conclude that almost all Cs can be removed
from WB by heat treatment at 700 °C; RSF indicated the formation
of Cs–Cl bonds after cooling from 700 °C to RT. In contrast,
despite the fact that more than half of the Cs was removed from WB
by heat treatments at 400 and 500 °C, RSF shows that most Cs
is surrounded by silica tetrahedrons maintained by Cs–O bonds.
We therefore confirmed the Cs removal process in the high-temperature
region: Cs is released from the clay minerals during heating in the
high-temperature process. In contrast, Cs removal in the low-temperature
region cannot be explained in the same manner, and we therefore presume
that another Cs removal process exists under these conditions. In
this work, we succeeded in demonstrating the usefulness of in situ
EXAFS analysis for the study of Cs removal from a clay mineral. This
new knowledge allows us to establish a method for Cs decontamination
from soil in Fukushima.

Materials and Methods
A WB sample,
which originated from the weathering of local granite,
was collected from Fukushima. This WB has been completely characterized
by Kikuchi et al.12 Cs sorption experiments
were performed according to a well-known method.18 The Cs-sorbed samples were prepared as follows: the clay
minerals were dispersed into a 1.0 × 10–1 mol
L–1 CsCl solution for 24 h while slowly stirring;
the solution was then centrifuged to separate the solid and the liquid,
and the supernatant was discarded. The 1.0 × 10–1 mol L–1 CsCl solution was added again, and the
above procedure was repeated five times. The remaining clay mineral
was then washed with distilled water and the presence of negligible
CsCl was confirmed by adding a silver nitrate solution and verifying
that the suspension was free of white turbidity. The sample was then
dried by a freeze-drying machine. WB was ground and screened to a
fine powder of less than 53 μm. Following the recommendations
of Shimoyama et al.,17 a NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt was used as the additive to the WB at a 1/1 molar
ratio.

We used the electronic furnace developed by Okamoto et
al. for
in situ EXAFS measurements at high temperatures.29 In situ EXAFS spectra were measured every 100 °C from
200 to 700 °C, maintaining a constant temperature during the
measurements. We also measured EXAFS spectra at RT after heating.
Cs K edge EXAFS spectra were measured using the BL11XU beamline in
SPring-8.30 We adopted the K edge because
we anticipated a small absorption loss due to the high X-ray transmission
in this energy region (∼36 keV). In general, the absorption
loss depends on the thickness of the quartz cell board. To achieve
good spectral statistics, we designed a quartz cell for the in situ
EXAFS measurements with a light path length of 1 mm between two pieces
of the quartz board, which had a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness
of 1 mm. Approximately 100 mg powder sample was loaded in the quartz
cell. The X-ray energy at the Cs K edge was calibrated to 35.98 keV
using a 0.1 mol L–1 CsCl solution. The EXAFS data
analysis, including background removal, normalization, extraction
of the EXAFS function, and Fourier transformation, was performed using WinXAS ver.3.2.31

In addition,
we measured ex situ EXAFS spectra at RT for samples
after heat treatment and removal of the salt to estimate the amount
of residual Cs in the sample. Ex situ EXAFS measurements at the Cs
K edge were also performed using the BL11XU beamline and quartz cell.
We conducted quantitative analysis of residual Cs in WB based on the
edge jump intensity in each EXAFS spectrum, which was defined as the
intensity ratio of the peak at 35.98 keV before and after subtraction
of the background curves using the Athena software.31

We prepared samples for ex situ EXAFS
measurements as follows:
the heat treatment was performed using an electric furnace (KTF045N1;
KOYO Thermo Co., Ltd.); NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt addition
was as described above. Samples were heated at a constant rate of
15 °C/min in air, and the temperature was maintained constant
for 120 min at each measurement level (200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and
700 °C). After heating, the samples were mixed with 10 mL distilled
water, the solution was centrifuged to separate the solid from the
liquid, and the supernatant was discarded. The samples were then freeze-dried.
To estimate the Cs content after washing of the salt from the sample,
the dried residues were analyzed by scanning wavelength-dispersive
XRF spectrometry (Rigaku; ZSX Primus II). Wavelength-dispersive XRF
has higher resolution than energy-dispersive XRF. In addition, mapping
measurement is possible on a sample image. The Cs content of the original
WB specimen was estimated at approximately 1 mass % as a standard
sample.
