Our work reports the hydrothermal
synthesis of a bimetallic composite
CoMoS, followed by the addition of cellulose fibers and its subsequent
carbonization under Ar atmosphere (CoMoS@C). For comparison, CoMoS
was heat-treated under the same conditions and referred as bare-CoMoS.
X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that CoMoS@C composite matches
with the CoMoS4 phase with additional peaks corresponding
to MoO3 and CoMoO4 phases, which probably arise
from air exposure during the carbonization process. Scanning
electron microscopy images of CoMoS@C exhibit how the CoMoS material
is anchored to the surface of carbonized cellulose fibers. As anode
material, CoMoS@C shows a superior performance than bare-CoMoS. The
CoMoS@C composite presents an initial high discharge capacity of ∼1164
mA h/g and retains a high specific discharge capacity of ∼715
mA h/g after 200 cycles at a current density of 500 mA/g compared
to that of bare-CoMoS of 102 mA h/g. The high specific capacity and
good cycling stability could be attributed to the synergistic effects
of CoMoS and carbonized cellulose fibers. The use of biomass in the
anode material represents a very easy and cost-effective way to improve
the electrochemical Li-ion battery performance.

1 Introduction
To
date, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely utilized for
portable electronic devices because of their promising properties,
including high energy density, long cycle lifetime, and low self-discharge.1 However, to meet nowadays the energy demands
for high-power applications, as in the case of electric vehicles and
smart grid systems, it is essential to find new anode materials with
higher rate capacity, longer cycling lifetime, and higher capacity
to that of graphite (372 mA g–1),2 the anode material currently used for commercially available
LIBs.

Recently, transition metal sulfides have reached great
attention
as anode materials for LIBs because of their high theoretical capacity.3−5 For example, molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has a theoretical
capacity value of 670 mA h/g6,7 (almost twice that of
graphite). Additionally, MoS2 holds a layer structure that
enables easy intercalation of Li ions within the (002) planes, hence
proving a fast diffusion of ions during electrochemical processes.8,9 However, this material suffers from low electric conductivity as
well as poor cycling stability because of its inherent high volume
change during the charging/discharging steps.8 On the other hand, cobalt sulfides with different compositions (CoS2, CoS, and Co9S8) have shown encouraging
results as anode materials for LIBs.10−14 Moreover, cobalt sulfides possess higher electrical
conductivity compared to other metal sulfides15,16 but also suffers from rapid capacity decay.17

Composites of MoS2 and cobalt sulfides, as well
as CoMoS
phases, have been investigated for other applications, including,
catalysis in hydrodeoxygenation,18,19 hydrodesulfurization,18,20 and hydrogen evolution reaction,21−24 among others. However, only a
few reports of the combination of molybdenum and cobalt sulfides for
its application in LIBs have been reported.9,25 The
combination of these two metal (Mo and Co) sulfides can offer synergistic
advantages over single systems as it has been reported for other bimetallic
sulfides for sodium-ion battery applications.26,27 Additionally, to improve the electrochemical performance of LIBs,
transition metal compounds have been combined with carbon-based materials
such as reduced graphene28,29 and carbon nanotubes,30,31 both of which are expensive materials and require elaborate methods
for fabrication. On the other hand, promising results for LIB applications
have been achieved from the combination of transition metal compounds
and biomass-derived carbon.32−34 The use of biomass represents
an easy and low-cost alternative to enhance the electrochemical performance
of LIBs.

Here, we present the synthesis of a bimetallic CoMoS
composite
by the hydrothermal method and the addition of cellulose fibers as
a carbon source, followed by carbonization under argon atmosphere
(CoMoS@C). The CoMoS@C composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). To investigate its electrochemical properties as
anode material for LIBs, galvanostatic, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements (EIS) were
performed. The addition of carbon significantly enhanced the cycling
stability and retained a high specific capacity of ∼715 mA
h/g after 200 cycles at a rate of 500 mA h/g compared to bare-CoMoS
which retained ∼102 mA h/g after 100 cycles.

2 Results and Discussion
The crystal structures of CoMoS (before
heat treatment), bare-CoMoS,
and CoMoS@C were characterized by XRD (Figure 1b–d). It can be seen that most of
the peaks from the three samples match with the CoMoS4 phase
registered in the COD (Crystallographic Open Database)36 no. 2106690 (Figure 1a). However, bare-CoMoS and CoMoS@C X-ray
spectrums (Figure 1c,d) show additional peaks corresponding to MoO3 and CoMoO4 phases with COD numbers 1011043 and 7205001, respectively.
We can see that most of the peaks corresponding to the oxide phases
appeared after the compounds were subjected to heat treatment at 400
°C (comparison of Figure 1b,c,d). Therefore, these peaks were most likely formed by
the accidental air exposure while the carbonization process was carried
out. Additionally, bare-CoMoS and CoMoS@C present very similar XRD
patterns. Nevertheless, it can be observed that bare-CoMoS displays
sharper peaks than those found in CoMoS@C, which shows broader peaks
possibly because of the poorly crystalline nature of the carbonized
cellulose fibers (Figure S1).

of (a) standard spectrum for CoMoS4, (b) CoMoS (before
heat treatment), (c) bare-CoMoS (after heat treatment
at 400 °C for 1 h under Ar), and (d) CoMoS@C.

The SEM micrographs of three samples are presented
in Figure 2a,b,d,e.
From Figure 2a, we
can observe
micron-sized particle clusters for the bare-CoMoS sample. An elongated
ribbonlike morphology can be observed for cellulose fibers carbonized
at 400 °C for 1 h with diameter sizes ranging from 5 to 22 μm
and an average size of ∼10 μm (Figure 2b). For sample CoMoS@C (Figure 2d), it is observed that some
carbonized cellulose fibers (with less than 10 μm in diameter
size) are decorated with CoMoS particle clusters with less than one
micron in size. Larger CoMoS particle clusters standing apart from
the fibers can also be seen. The SEM image (Figure 2e) of an individual microfiber at larger
magnification shows that the particle clusters anchored to its surface
have diameter sizes ranging from 0.3 to 2 μm with a seemingly
uniform particle distribution along the fiber. A more detailed perspective
of the morphology can be appreciated in the TEM images of bare-CoMoS
and CoMoS@C (Figure 2c,f, respectively). Aggregates of nanosheets can be observed for
both materials with no significant differences between the two samples.

To obtain information about the chemical composition of the
samples,
EDS analysis was performed. Figure 3a shows the SEM selected area of CoMoS@C for EDS analysis.
As can be seen, the selected area is composed of both CoMoS particles
and carbon fibers. The EDS spectrum of CoMoS@C (Figure 3f) confirms that this sample is composed
of Mo, S, Co, and C elements, as well as some amount of oxygen coming
from the carbonized cellulose fibers (Figure S2. From the elemental mapping images (Figure 3b–e), we can observe a homogeneous
distribution for all of the elements.

sample CoMoS@C, (b–e)

CoMoS@C.

To quantify the carbon amount
in CoMoS@C, TGA was performed from
room temperature to 1000 °C under air atmosphere. The TGA curves
of carbon fibers (Figure S3) showed a large
reduction of weight from 100 to 8% starting from ∼350 °C
up until 550 °C. Afterward, the sample weight kept nearly constant
up until 1000 °C. The TGA results from CoMoS@C shows a weight
reduction starting at ∼350 °C, this closely matches the
weight loss of the carbon fibers. The CoMoS@C sample plateau at 550
°C with 72% leftover weight was caused by the conversion of carbon
to CO2. At temperatures greater than 550 °C, the oxidation
of organic materials, Mo and Co, took place. Additionally, we can
see that the weight drop from ∼400 to 500 °C is absent
for bare-CoMoS. Therefore, the carbon content in sample CoMoS@C is
estimated to be ∼28%.

The electrochemical performance
of CoMoS@C was first evaluated
by testing the charge/discharge galvanostatic measurements. Figure 4a displays the 1st,
2nd, 3rd, and 25th cycles at a current density of 100 mA/g between
0.01 and 3 V versus Li+/Li for CoMoS@C sample. For comparison,
we also present the charge/discharge results for bare-CoMoS under
the same electrochemical conditions (Figure 4a). The discharge capacities for bare-CoMoS
were 1043, 575, 519, and 396 mA h/g, respectively. By contrast, CoMoS@C
(Figure 4b) showed
significantly higher specific capacities of 1461, 925, 839, and 756
mA h/g, respectively. We also investigated the cycling performance
of CoMoS@C for 200 cycles at a current rate of 500 mA/g (Figure 4d). CoMoS@C showed
an initial high specific capacity of 1165 mA h/g and retained a high
specific capacity value of ∼715 mA h/g and a CE above 97% after
200 cycles. In contrast, bare-CoMoS maintained a low specific capacity
of ∼102 mA h/g after 100 cycles. The CoMoS@C composite kept
a discharge capacity of ∼425 mA h/g (Figure 4c) when discharged at different rates (100,
200, 500, and 1000 mA/g) after 40 cycles.

bare-CoMoS and (b) CoMoS@C. (c) Rate capability
of CoMoS@C from 0.1 to 1 Ag–1. (d) Cycling performance
of CoMoS and CoMoS@C at a current rate of 500 mA/g and Coulombic efficiency

To study the influence
of the carbonized fibers in the cycling
performance of CoMoS@C, an electrode of carbonized fibers was subjected
to charge and discharge measurements for several cycles at a rate
of 100 mA/g (Figure S4a,c). The carbon
fiber material showed only one discharge and does not have the ability
of recharging, probably due to the low carbonization temperature.
Therefore, the superior electrochemical performance of the CoMoS@C
electrode is due to the synergistic effect of CoMoS and the carbonized
fibers. CoMoS contributes to the high specific capacity value, and
the carbon fibers stabilize the cycling performance of the electrode.
Carbon fibers improved the electrical conductivity (as is shown latter
in the Nyquist plots, Figure 5b) as well as buffering the electrode volume changes and preventing
the electrode material from pulverization, as reported previously
in other publications.37,38

Figure 5 (a) CV and (b) Nyquist plots for CoMoS@C
(inset: bare-CoMoS).

To further explore the electrochemical reactions of CoMoS@C
and
bare-CoMoS electrodes, CV measurements were performed for the first
three cycles, and the results are shown in Figures 5a and S5b, respectively. The first cathodic
scan for sample CoMoS@C presents three peaks at 1.61, 0.86 V, and
another that ranges from ∼0.43 to ∼0.06 V. For the first
anodic scan, only one big peak at ∼2.45 V is shown. In the
following cycles, the cathodic peak in the range of ∼0.43 to
0.06 V disappears, the peak at 0.86 V stays at the same voltage position
but the current decreased considerably, and the other peak becomes
wider and slightly shifts from 1.61 to 1.69 V. Similarly, the peak
at 2.45 V in the subsequent cycles for anodic scans stays in that
potential and a new one appears at 1.7 V.

The peak at 0.86 V
for the first cathodic scan can be attributed
to the intercalation of Li ions into the lattice of CoMoS4 (LixCoMoS4), whereas the
peak in the range of 0.43–0.06 V can be ascribed to the further
reduction of LixCoMoS4 into
metallic Mo and Co embedded into a LiS2 matrix and also
to the formation of a gel-like polymer, resulting from the irreversible
electrolyte degradation [also called the solid electrolyte interface
(SEI)] in the first discharge, as is reported by a similar study25 and other publications related to the intercalation
of Li ions (lithiation) into molybdenum and cobalt sulfides.6,12,39−43 In the second and third cathodic scans, the peak
at 1.69 V can be assigned to the intercalation of Li ions into cobalt
and molybdenum sulfides.44,45 In addition, the peak
in the range of 0.43–0.06 V disappears. This fact coupled with
the big reduction in capacity from the first to the second discharge
(charge/discharge curves, Figure 5b) confirms the irreversibility of the SEI formation.
In contrast, the peaks at 1.7 and 2.45 V in the first anodic scan,
as suggested by some studies, correspond to the conversion reaction
of Mo and Co as well as LiS2 to form molybdenum sulfide
and cobalt sulfides,25,45 whereas other studies allude
that this latter peak (2.45 V) corresponds to the formation of LiS2 to S8–2.46

In the subsequent cycles (CoMoS@C), the CV curves
almost overlap
each other, indicating good reversibility of the electrode. On the
other hand, for sample bare-CoMoS (Figure S5b), the redox peak intensity significantly decreases over cycling,
indicating poor cycling performance. This result implies that the
carbon matrix stabilizes the cycling performance for CoMoS@C electrode
as is demonstrated by other studies which used cobalt sulfide and
molybdenum sulfide with and without carbon addition.12,41,42,47,48

To have a better understanding of
the resistive behavior, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy  (EIS) was conducted for bare-CoMoS,
CoMoS@C (Figure 5b),
and carbonized fibers (Figure S5a). Figure 5b shows the raw experimental
and fitted Nyquist plots for CoMoS@C and CoMoS (inset of Figure 5b) as well as the
equivalent circuit used for fitting the plots. The EIS curves for
the three electrode materials are composed of a depressed semicircle
in the high–medium frequency region and a straight line in
the low-frequency region. The high–medium frequency semicircle
is composed of Rs (Ohm resistance of the
battery) and Rct (charge-transfer resistance).
The inclined line represents the Warburg impedance (W) caused by the Li ions diffusion. According to the equivalent circuit,
the values for CoMoS and CoMoS@C are 72 and 40 Ω, respectively,
and 65 Ω for carbonized fibers. The charge-transfer resistance
(Rct) for CoMoS@C is 327 Ω, 827
Ω for CoMoS, and 596 Ω for carbonized fibers. Therefore,
the CoMoS@C electrode possesses the lowest charge-transfer resistance.

3 Conclusions
In summary, CoMoS@C composite was fabricated
by the combination
of CoMoS synthesized by hydrothermal method and cellulose fibers carbonized
at 400 °C for 1 h. This composite shows significantly improved
electrochemical performance when compared to bare-CoMoS. The carbonized
bimetallic composite, CoMoS@C, retained a high specific discharge
capacity of 715 mA h/g with a CE greater than 97% after 200 cycles
at a current rate of 500 mA/g. The high specific discharge capacity
and superior cycling stability can be accredited to the synergistic
effect between the CoMoS and carbonized cellulose fibers. The use
of biomass-derived carbon may offer an easy and cost-effective strategy
to improve the electrochemical performance of metal and bimetallic
sulfides and other metallic compounds.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis of CoMoS
The synthesis
of CoMoS (cobalt–molybdenum sulfide) was carried out by hydrothermal
method in a high-pressure reactor (Par model 4540). The first step
consisted the synthesis of ammonium thiomolybdate (ATM) that was synthesized
following the improved method by Alonso et al.35 Next, ATM (19.2 mmol) was dispersed in a minimum amount
of deionized water under constant stirring, followed by the addition
of an equivalent molar amount (19.2 mmol) of NTA (nitriloacetic acid,
Sigma-Aldrich) to this dispersion under stirring. Separately, 13.5
mmol of CoNO3·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) was
dissolved in a minimum amount of deionized water and added to the
ATM/NTA mixture. The reaction mixture was transferred to the reactor
vessel and heated to 300 °C for 2 h. It is important to mention
that the pressure inside the reactor increased to 1200 PSI when the
reaction reached 300 °C.

4.2 Synthesis
of CoMoS@C
First, 100 mg
of CoMoS and 57 mg of medium-size cellulose fibers (cotton linters
from Sigma-Aldrich) were placed in a vial and agitated for 5 min at
3000 rpm in a vortex machine. This mixture was placed in a ceramic
boat, introduced into a tubular furnace (MTI Corporation, GSL-1100X-LD),
and heated at 400 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 5 °C/min
under argon atmosphere. This sample was referred as CoMoS@C. For comparison
purposes, CoMoS by itself was thermally treated under the same conditions
and labeled as bare-CoMoS.

4.3 Characterization
XRD measurements
were performed on a D8 diffractometer from Bruker Instruments (Cu
Kα radiation, λ = 0.154 nm) with a scan rate of two degree/min.
SEM and EDS images were obtained by using a Hitachi S-4800 machine.
TEM images were acquired by a Hitachi H-7650 equipment. Image J software
was used to measure the sizes of the particles and carbonized cellulose
fibers from SEM images. TGA was conducted to quantify the carbon amount
for CoMoS@C.

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
The
working electrodes were prepared by mixing the active material (CoMoS@C),
acetylene black, and a binder composed of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose
dissolved in deionized water (3 wt %) in a weight ratio percentage
of 70:15:15, respectively. The obtained slurry was then coated onto
a copper foil and dried overnight under vacuum at 100 °C. The
electrodes were cut with a diameter of 1.3 cm using a precision disc
cutter from MTI Corporation. The coin cells (CR 2032) were assembled
inside of an Ar-filled glovebox with oxygen levels maintained below
0.1 ppm. Li foil was used as the counter/reference electrode, a ceramic-coated
membrane (16 μm thick) from MTI Corporation was utilized as
the separator (EQ-bsf-0016-500A), and the electrolyte employed was
1.0 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:1
in volume) from Sigma-Aldrich. The specific capacity was calculated
based on the active material weight. The galvanostatic charge/discharge
measurements were performed in an eight-channel battery analyzer (MTI
Corporation) with a voltage window of 0.01–3 V. The EIS and
CV studies were conducted in a CHI760D electrochemical workstation.
EIS was measured in coin cells in a frequency range of 0.01–100 000
Hz at an ac amplitude of 0.05 V. The CV was evaluated in a three-electrode
setup using an electrochemical cell (990-00343) from Gamry Instruments
within the range of 3.0–0.01 V at a scan rate of 0.01 V.
