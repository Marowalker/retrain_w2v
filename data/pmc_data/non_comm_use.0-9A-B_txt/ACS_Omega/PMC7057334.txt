Over the past decade, the available
crystal structures have almost
doubled in Protein Data Bank (PDB) providing the research community
with a series of similar crystal structures to choose from for future
docking studies. With the steady growth in the number of high-resolution
three-dimensional protein structures, ligand docking-based virtual
screening of chemical libraries to a receptor plays a critical role
in the drug discovery process by identifying new drug candidates.
Thus, identifying potential candidates among all the available structures
in a database for docking studies is of utmost importance. Our work
examined whether one could use the resolution of a number of known
structures, without considering other parameters, to choose a good
experimental structure for various docking studies to find more useful
drug leads. We expected that a good experimental structure for docking
studies to be the one that gave favorable docking with the largest
number of ligands among the experimental structures to be selected.
We chose three protein test systems for our study, all belonging to
the family of MAPK: (1) JNK1, (2) JNK2, and (3) JNK3. On analysis
of the results, the best resolution structures showed significant
variations from the expected values in their result, whereas the poor
resolution structures proved to be better candidates for docking studies.

1 Introduction
Drug
discovery and drug research have contributed more to the progress
in the field of medicine than any other scientific factors. Even a
single disease can have many options for a drug.1 As the pharmaceutical industry evolves, the need to find
an easier way to access new drug compounds becomes a necessity.2 Finding a new chemical entity and its structural
scaffold is the essence of drug designing. Virtual screening (VS)
emerged as one of the answers to this quest with numerous methodological
protocols available in screening databases for the lead compounds,
which fill this chasm in drug discovery.3 It is a high-throughput screening of millions of compound databases
in the hope of finding a unique compound or a drug that can replace
an existing drug or that can shed light on diseases with no drugs
to treat them until now. In the virtual screening process, a target
protein in a complex with a bound ligand represents a conformation
of the target optimally adapted to accommodate that particular ligand.
There are various screening algorithms and schemes that test and select
among thousands of ligands based on their compatibility toward the
target molecule of a particular disease.4 The efficiency of any virtual screening technique lies in its effective
reciprocity between the computational technique and the experimental
research that paves a way for proper screening of potential leads.
For any drug discovery, after high-throughput screening (HTS), the
small-molecule hits undergo transformation into active compounds with
selective binding behavior, which leads to identification of promising
lead compounds with drug-like activities through limited optimization.5−7

Out of the structure-based virtual screening and ligand-based
virtual
screening, molecular docking falls under the first category that brings
and binds the two molecular structures together in a preferred conformation.
Being the most widely used method in modeling three-dimensional structures,
molecular docking consists of two steps: (i) searching the conformational
space of the ligand that binds to target molecules and (ii) using
a scoring function to evaluate these ligands.6 Thus, molecular-docking-based virtual screening essentially identifies
chemically diverse hits when the three-dimensional structure of the
target is available.

The recent years have seen an explosion
in the number of available
structures of biological targets in databases, thus making it difficult
to surf through them all and choose a single target structure for
docking studies. The success of the docking-based virtual screening
is sensitive to the choice of the 3D structure of the target.8 Resolution essentially refers to the amount of
information obtained from a crystal in a protein crystallography experiment,
and it is a measure of the level of detail present in the diffraction
pattern and the level of detail that will be seen when the electron
density map is calculated. Best resolution structures are highly ordered,
and it is easy to see every atom in the electron density map, whereas
poorer resolution structures show only the basic contours of the protein
chain. Selecting a best resolution structure among the available structures
in a database is the common procedure followed in docking studies
making resolution one of the important parameters in selection of
target structures. A reliable resolution value for small-molecule
docking is below 1.2 Å, which is when the atomic resolution is
achieved. However, resolutions below 1.5 Å coinciding with the
mean length of the covalent bond are rarely achieved, and most structures
available have resolutions of 1.5 to 2.5 Å.9 Most software and algorithms yield a good result for structures
below 2.2 Å, thus making it the threshold for selection.10

The significant future prospects of JNKs
acting as targets for
new drug discoveries triggered it to be taken as the test case subject.
c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are members of the MAPK family of
protein kinases that influence gene transcription based on their ability
to phosphorylate and activate multiple transcription factors like
c-Jun.11−13

JNKs encoded by the JUN gene
consist of 10 isoforms
derived from three genes, namely, JNK1 (4 isoforms), JNK2 (4 isoforms),
and JNK3 (2 isoforms).14 The improved understanding
of JNK regulation and derived functions strongly suggests that the
time has come to seriously consider the development and clinical application
of JNK inhibitors that may be used as insulin sensitizers and to treat
rheumatoid arthritis.15 In PDB, there are
32 structures of JNK1 with 22 different ligands, 2 structures of JNK2
with 2 different ligands, and 51 structures of JNK3 with 48 ligands.
In order to carry out an unbiased study, JNK2 was neglected due to
its negligible number of structures.

2 Results
2.1 Redocking and Cross Docking of JNK1 and JNK3
Out of
the 10 apo structures and 22 complex structures of JNK1, 2XRW had the best resolution
of 1.33 Å making it the widely used structure compared to the
rest of the structures in PDB (until 2019). 2G01, 2GMX, and 3VUD were less preferred
structures because of their poorer resolution (3.5 Å). We have
scrutinized all structures of JNK1, and they had the DFG-IN conformation
where the Asp169 of the DFG is able to coordinate magnesium. It also
had an activation loop consisting of amino acid residues 169–190
in JNK1, which was present in 8 structures, absent in 14 structures,
and disconnected due to missing residues in 10 structures.

The
redocking of all the ligands of JNK1 to their corresponding apo structures
with the RMSD value (in Å) and binding energies (in kcal/mol)
is shown in Supporting Information S1.
The 20 ligands of JNK1 that were docked with the 32 structures showed
the docking efficiency of each structure by showing its degree of
acceptance toward various ligands. The cross docking ability of each
structure of JNK1 and the mean RMSD value in Å for each structure
and each ligand are analyzed in Supporting Information S2. Though the 32 structures belonged to the
same kinase, that is, JNK1, and had almost similar structures, they
showed significantly diverse docking results with each ligand, and
very little similarity was observed. The cross docking RMSD value
for JNK1 was in the range of 0.41 (4QTD docked with MYU) to 7.41 Å (6F5E docked with 1J2),
and this significant variation in docking paved a way for deeper analysis
to understand the reason behind it. We have calculated the number
of docked poses below an RMSD of 2 Å9,10 for
all structures of JNK1 and JNK3 to evaluate their docking performances
and provide a statistical basis for our study. The mean RMSD of the
18 ligands was around 2 Å (2.10 Å), which also justifies
the threshold RMSD (2 Å) taken for our study. In our cross docking
analysis, 5LW1 and 4AWI had
less RMSD values than 2XRW in the case of 8 and 12 ligands, respectively (Figure 1). On average, the
RMSD of the best resolution structure 2XRW was greater than 2 Å in 10 of the
20 ligands, whereas in the case of 4AWI, 19 of the 20 ligands had RMSD less than
2 Å and in the case of 5LW1, 17 of 20 ligands had RMSD less than
2 Å, thus making them more compatible for docking studies.

of cross docking results of JNK1 structures: 5LW1, 4AWI, and 2XRW.

Similarly, the JNK3 structures deposited in PDB consist of
51 structures
(until 2019) having 47 different ligands, out of which only four were
apo structures. Among them, 3OY1 had the best resolution with 1.7 Å and 3CGF, 3CGO, and 4H36 having resolutions
of 3 Å each. The DFG motif occupying positions 207–209
was in DFG-IN conformation for all the structures where the magnesium
was steered to its position by the Asp207 of the motif. Redocking
of ligands with their corresponding JNK3 structures posed a certain
difficulty due to the various sizes and flexibility of ligands, but
most of the structures with the exemption of three (3V6R,3V6S, and 4Z9L) gave considerable
redocking results as shown in Supporting Information S3. The RMSD in cross docking of JNK3 structures was in the
range of 0.17 (cross docking between 1PMU and 9HP) to 10.3 Å (cross docking
between 4W4X and 738), and these significant results are shown in Supporting
Information S4. We also calculated the
mean RMSD in each case of the JNK3 structures and their corresponding
ligands docking efficiency in cross docking calculations.

Studies
were carried out to show that the poor docking performances
of certain structures may have been effectively due to the orientation
of few residues that almost blocked their active sites like a lid
and reduced their sizes. We also grouped structurally similar ligands,
and their cross docking performances were analyzed in both JNK1 and
JNK3 to know if the structural similarity of the ligands influenced
the docking studies. This was essential to check the contribution
of the co-crystallized ligands to the docking performances of the
JNK structures and to assess the importance of this contribution,
thereby contributing to a full-fledged study. In JNK1 and JNK3, ligands
with the highest and lowest mean RMSDs that were also structurally
similar were grouped together to analyze their docking performances.

3 Discussion
Virtual screening protocols with
their ability to swiftly navigate
through databases to finalize a lead compound in the drug discovery
process have made a significant contribution in the field of computational
biology. Thus, various research activities are being carried out related
to virtual screening to further make the drug discovery process more
quick and efficient. The curiosity that led us to choose JNKs as our
test case is the plethora of studies where JNKs are used as targets
for new drug discoveries. In addition to the emerging role of JNK
in insulin resistance and improving insulin sensitivity, JNK inhibitors
may have the added bonus of reducing obesity, which is one of the
most common diseases found among humans.16 Thus, docking studies of JNKs are significant, currently due to
its various contributions toward drug discovery. The docking study
carried out in our test case with JNK1 revealed that structures 3PZE and 4L7F having resolutions
of 2 and 1.95 Å, respectively, had the best results with minimal
RMSD values of 0.56 and 0.61 Å during redocking, respectively.
Considering the general approach toward docking studies, the structure
with the best resolution would be taken, and in our case, structures 2XRW, 4QTD, and 3ELJ are those possible
candidates with resolutions of 1.33, 1.5, and 1.8 Å, respectively.
However, profound analysis of cross docking results (Supporting Information S2) of JNK1 revealed that 4AWI (resolution of 1.91
Å) and 5LW1 (resolution of 3.2 Å) had the scope of being more potential
candidates for docking analysis having compatibility with 19 out of
20 ligands (RMSD <2 Å) in the case of 4AWI and 17 out of 20
ligands (RMSD <2 Å) in the case of 5LW1. Meanwhile, we found that only eight
ligands had RMSD less than 2 Å in the case of the best resolution
structure 2XRW (Figure 1). This
contradicted the preconceived idea that only the best resolution structures
could be potential candidates leading to a more equivocal approach
in docking analysis. Likewise, the cross docking of JNK1 structures 4HYU (2.31 Å) having
compatibility with 17 ligands; 4E73 (2.27 Å) and 4L7F (1.95 Å) with
16 ligands; 4G1W (2.45 Å) and 4YR8 (2.4 Å) with 15 ligands; 2GMX (3.5 Å), 2XS0 (2.6 Å), and 4UX9 (2.34 Å) with
14 ligands was performed.

The most noncompatibility was observed
with the structure of 6F5E having a resolution
of 2.7 Å, which had an RMSD range of 1.99 to 7.41 Å. 6F5E had conformation
of residues Ser179, Phe180, and Met181 protruding into the active
site, thereby reducing its size and inhibiting docking of various
ligands to it. Figure 2a,b shows the active sites of a well docked structure 4AWI and poorly docked
structure 6F5E. It is clear that the residues around ligand 877 in 4AWI allow easy docking,
whereas the conformations of the residues around ligand 877 in 6F5E restrict docking
by protruding into the docking site.

Figure 2 (a) Ligand G1W (yellow) is docked into
the active site of 4AWI (cyan) where residues
around 5 Å are shown. (b) The ligand G1W (yellow) is docked into
the active site of 6F5E (purple) where residues around 5 Å are shown.

The mean RMSD was calculated for the docking of each single
ligand
with the 32 structures to see how far the cross docked RMSD deviated
from the mean RMSD in the case of each ligand. Ligand G1W showed the
least mean RMSD of 1.472 Å followed by ligand 0NR, which had
a slightly higher mean RMSD of 1.475 Å. The highest mean RMSD
was seen with cross docking of ligands 1BK (mean RMSD of 2.653 Å),
1J2 (mean RMSD of 2.775 Å), and 1V5 (mean RMSD of 2.738 Å).
The best resolution structure 2XRW (1.33 Å) exceeded mean RMSD when
docked with six of the 18 ligands, while structures 5LW1 (resolution of 3.2
Å) and 4AWI (resolution of 1.91 Å) exceeded mean RMSD when docked with
five and two ligands out of the 18 ligands, respectively, which are
highlighted in Supporting Information S2.

The flexibility of the target protein is what allows it to
adopt
a different conformation in the presence of a chemically diverse ligand
paving a way conducive to a new drug lead. In previous docking studies,
apo structures and structures with larger ligands proved to be efficient
candidates compared to structures with smaller ligands,17 which may have been due to the size of the active
site cavity. Similarly, in this case, apo structures or structures
having larger ligands bound to them in their native state showed better
results in docking. To further prove this, the active sites of 2XRW (best resolution
structure) and 5LW1 (one of the structures with the best docking results) that were
superimposed to see if any of the residues protruded into the active
site that made these two structurally similar structures show varying
docking results. The active sites of 2XRW and 5LW1 were similar except for Lys55 of 5LW1 and Val186 of 2XRW, which is not present
in other structures due to the phosphate group of ligand ANP occupying
a larger area in 2XRW (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Superimposition
of active sites of 2XRW (magenta) and 5LW1 (green). The residues within 5 Å
of the active sites of 2XRW and 5LW1 are similar. Also, Lys55 of 5LW1 and Val186 of 2XRW are included and are not present in other
structures due to the phosphate group of ligand ANP (blue) occupying
a larger area in 2XRW. ADN is displayed in cyan.

One cannot come to a solid conclusion without discussing the role
of the co-crystallized ligand whose study might provide a closure
to the question of the influence of the co-crystallized ligand on
docking performance. Hence, the structurally similar ligands of JNK1
were grouped together. In the case of ligands G1W and 0NR, which had
the least mean RMSDs (Supporting Information S2) and also structurally very similar (Figure 4a), redocking RMSDs were 0.81 and 1.12 Å
when docked with their corresponding apo structures 4G1W and 4E73, respectively. Ligand
G1W when cross docked with 4E73 showed an RMSD of 1.27 Å, which was less than
the mean RMSD of 1.472 Å, whereas ligand 0NR when crossed docked
with 4G1W had
an RMSD of 2.21 Å and also exceeded the mean RMSD of 1.475 Å
(Figure 4b). When grouping
structurally similar ligands in the other end of the gradient, that
is, grouping ligands with the highest mean RMSD, similar results were
observed. In the case of ligands 1BJ, 1BK, and 1J2 that had the highest
mean RMSDs (Supporting Information S2)
and were also structurally similar (Figure 5a,b), the redocking RMSDs were found to be
0.82, 0.84, and 0.7 Å, respectively. In contrast to the common
expectation, these ligands showed cross docking RMSDs that were poles
apart even though they were structurally analogous. When 1BJ was docked
with 4HYU and 4IZY, the cross docking
RMSD was the same (0.61 Å), which was lower than their corresponding
mean RMSD. Ligand 1BK when docked with 4IZY had an RMSD of 0.79 Å, and ligand
1J2 when docked with 4HYU had an RMSD of 0.64 Å. These docking RMSDs were much below
the mean RMSD values. This was not the case with ligand 1BK when docked
with 4HYS with
an RMSD of 1.75 Å and ligand 1J2 when docked with 4HYS with an
RMSD of 2.19 Å, thus exceeding the mean RMSD in each case. These
results provide imperative evidence that ligand similarity does not
affect the docking studies.

ligands of JNK1 with

of JNK1 with
the highest mean RMSD: 1BJ of 4HYS (pink), 1BK of 4HYU (gray), and 1J2

In the case of JNK3, the results of all the redocking
and cross
docking showed a favorable outcome toward our study where poor resolution
structures proved to be better candidates for docking. More than 1000 redocked and cross docked structures were categorized
based on the docking result, and the mean RMSD was calculated to act
as a threshold value to evaluate the docking of each structure of
JNK3 (Supporting Information S4). 2B1P, 3FI2, and 3FI3 (having resolutions
of 1.9, 2.2, and 2.28 Å, respectively) emerged as the best structures
that were compatible with 36, 35, and 35 ligands by having RMSD values
in the range of 0.73 to 1.81 Å in the case of 2B1P and the other two
structures having RMSDs in the range of 0.5 to 8.99 Å and 0.51
to 9.81 Å, respectively (Figure 6). The supposedly best resolution structures like 3OY1 (1.7 Å), 4WHZ (1.79 Å), 6EMH (1.76 Å), and 6EQ9 (1.83 Å) showed
an average of 60% acceptable RMSD value (less than 2 Å). The
structures 3G9L (compatible with 32 ligands), 3TTJ (compatible with 32 ligands), 2EXC (compatible with
31 ligands), 4U79 (compatible with 31 ligands), 4W4W (compatible with 31 ligands), 4Z9L (compatible with
30 ligands), and 2WAJ (compatible with 30 ligands), which are usually not considered for
docking studies due to their resolution being greater than 2 Å,
showed nearly good results like the structures of 2B1P, 3FI2, and 3FI3. However, structures 4H3B and 4H36 had residues Thr216,
Met220, and Thr221 in their active sites, visibly reducing the volume
of the cavity and hence prohibiting the docking of many ligands into
them. Thus, they showed docking with only one and four ligands of
the total 44 ligands. Figure 7a,b shows the active sites of the best docked structure 2B1P and poorly docked
structure 4H3B.

Figure 6 Comparison of cross docking results of JNK3 structures: 2B1P, 3FI2, and 3OY1.

Figure 7 (a) Ligand AIZ (yellow) is docked into the active site of 2B1P (cyan) where residues
around 5 Å are shown. (b) The ligand AIZ (yellow) is docked into
the active site of 4H3B (white) where residues around 5 Å are shown.

It is observed that the ligands 255 and J88 had the least
mean
RMSDs of 1.352 and 1.413 Å and ligands 3EL and FMY have the highest
mean RMSDs of 3.382 and 3.275 Å, respectively. The best resolution
structure of 3OY1 (1.7 Å) in its cross docking results with 44 ligands deviated
from the mean RMSD in 15 cases, whereas much poorer resolution structures
like 3FI2, 3FI3, and 2B1P (having resolutions
of 2.2, 2.28, and 1.9 Å, respectively) deviated from the mean
RMSD only in 9, 7, and 11 out of the 44 cases, respectively. This
was a crucial delegation that supported our case wherein the supposedly
preferred structures like 3OY1 were surpassed by much poorer resolution structures
such as 3FI2, 3FI3, and 2B1P.

The roles
of the co-crystallized ligands of JNK3 were analyzed
in depth to check if they contributed to the docking studies. The
structurally similar ligands of JNK3 were grouped together like in
the case of ligands JK1, JK2, 3H8, 3HJ, 3HN, 3HQ, and 3NL, which produced
varying cross docking RMSD results though they were structurally alike
(Figure 8a,b). Ligand
JK1 exceeded its mean RMSD when docked with 4W4W, whereas ligand
JK2 did not exceed its mean RMSD in all the six cross docking cases.
Though the results of cross docking of ligands 3H8, 3HJ, 3HN, 3HQ,
and 3NL varied significantly, they never exceeded the mean RMSD and
were all below 2 Å (Supporting Information S4). The second group of structurally similar ligands of JNK3
includes J07, JNO, 3WH, B9K, and BGE (Figure 9a,b), which when redocked with their corresponding
apo structures had RMSDs of 0.36, 1.4, 0.52, 1.69, and 1.36 Å,
respectively. However, when these ligands were cross docked with the
other ligands’ apo structures, they showed intense variation
in their cross docking RMSDs. Ligand J07, which when docked with 3CGO, 4X21, 6EMH, and 6EKD, had RMSDs of 1.77,
0.66, 4.17, and 2 Å, respectively. The ligand JNO when docked
with 2P33, 4X21, 6EMH, and 6EKD had RMSDs of 1.02,
1.15, 1.36, and 1.26 Å, respectively. In both these cases, except
for the docking between ligand J07 with 6EMH, the RMSD values did not exceed the mean
RMSD values but still produced extensively varying results in docking.
Similarly, ligand 3WH showed radical deviation from its mean RMSD
of 3.113 Å when cross docked with structures 2P33, 3CGO, 6EMH, and 6EKD (having RMSD values
of 5.53, 3.7, 3.89, and 1.91 Å, respectively). In contrast, ligands
B9K and BGE did not exceed their mean RMSD values but still showed
considerable variation in their cross docking RMSD values. This gives
concrete evidence that ligand similarity does not affect the docking
results in JNK3.

4 Conclusions
The
success rate of docking of poor resolution structures in both
JNK 1 and JNK3 was better than that of best resolution structures.
Though all the structures of JNK1 and JNK3 had almost similar sequences
and structures, they produced varied docking results. In the structures
that produced poor docking results like 6F5E in JNK1 and 4H3B and 4H36 in JNK3, the orientation of few residues
resulted in reduction in the size of the active site of the structure,
thus potentially making the structure lose its binding affinity toward
larger ligands. It was also proven that, in JNK1 and JNK3, the structural
similarity of ligands did not influence the docking studies. Of all
the available structures, choosing a structure of best resolution
(below a threshold value of 2.2 Å) may lead to losing a potential
candidate with higher docking capability. In the case of JNK1 and
JNK3, it is proven that the threshold value does not hold good when
it comes to docking studies and that resolution alone cannot be used
as selection criteria for docking associated virtual screening studies.
Our test case using JNKs is the first step to find a good experimental
structure suitable for docking studies among the numerous options
available in various databases, and this work needs confirmation on
other kinases and other protein systems.

5 Computational
Methods
The docking procedure was carried out using AUTODOCK
4.2 using
the Lamarckian genetic algorithm,18−20 and images were generated
using PyMOL on a Linux environment.

5.1 Sampling
and Scrutinizing the Data
The structures of JNK1 (32 structures)
and JNK3 (51 structures) were
downloaded from PDB and were sorted based on parameters like their
resolution, ligand, number of protein chains, residue count, and author
name (Supporting Information S5 and S6). With the help of the KLIFS database,21 the structures were also sorted based on the
position of the DFG motif and its conformation (IN or OUT), activation
loop, hinge region, gatekeeper residue, and the corresponding ligand’s
binding position (orthosteric or allosteric site) (Supporting Information S7 and S8). The DFG
motif is also called the magnesium positioning loop because the Asp169
in JNK1 and Asp207 in JNK3 coordinate magnesium at the active site
that occupies positions 169–171 of the activation loop in JNK1
and positions 207–209 in JNK3. The sequences of all the corresponding
PDB structures of both JNKs were compared with the JNK1 sequence and
JNK3 sequence from Uniprot (Uniprot ID - P45983 MK08_HUMAN and P53779
MK10_HUMAN) to find the missing residues in each case.

5.2 Preparing the Structures for Redocking and
Cross Docking
Using PyMOL, all the 32 structures of JNK1
and 51 structures of JNK3 were superimposed onto a reference structure
(2XRW for JNK1
and 3OY1 for
JNK3) to set them all into the same coordinates (Figure 10a,b), and their ligands were
extracted with the superimposed coordinates of the protein structures
for the same purpose. In order to use every ligand individually for
docking, the complex structures were separated into their corresponding
co-crystals and apo structures and saved separately.

Figure 10 (a) 32 structures of
JNK1 were superimposed onto reference structure 2XRW to set them all
into same coordinates. (b) 51 structures of JNK3 were superimposed
onto reference structure 2B1P to set them all into the same coordinates.

5.3 Molecular Docking Protocol
The capability
to correctly predict the ligand–protein interaction is fundamental
to any reliable docking algorithm and the necessary starting point
for any virtual screening protocol. AUTODOCK 4.2 performs automated
computer simulated docking studies using grid-based energy evaluation
in a docking technique, which was utilized for the study of binding
modes of the potential ligands with the JNKs. Docking entails predicting
the protein–ligand complex structure by sampling conformations
of the ligand in the active site of the protein using Lamarckian genetic
algorithm and is followed by scoring in order to rank the compounds.
The docking parameters were set as default, and the numbers of GA
runs were limited to 10. The co-crystals were redocked into their
apo structures to validate using AUTODOCK 4.2;22 they were also cross docked into the remaining structures,
and the results like binding energy, RMSD value, and mean RMSD were
noted. To ease the protocol of docking multitudinous structures, a
loop program was created using the shell script to generate the grid
and dock log files (Supporting Information S9). The whole process of docking was fully automated using various
programs developed in-house. This was done for 20 ligands of JNK1
and 47 ligands of JNK3. Also, their rotatable bonds were adjusted,
and ligands of two structures of JNK1 (3O2M and 3VUM) were not considered as their ligands
bound to the allosteric site, which poses a complication during docking.23,24 In JNK3, three structures (3V6R, 3V6S, and 4Z9L)
were not included in the docking studies because their ligands were
too flexible (no. of rotatable bonds was more) to be considered for
docking as it could be a limitation in any docking protocol. The roles
of co-crystallized ligands of JNK1 and JNK3 were analyzed by grouping
together the structurally similar ligands and analyzing their docking
performances with the various structures to check if the ligand study
has an imperative contribution toward the docking studies.
