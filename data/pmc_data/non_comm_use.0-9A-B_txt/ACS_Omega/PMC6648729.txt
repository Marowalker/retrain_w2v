In this work, the
study of photocatalytic hydrogen production by
RGO/ZnIn2S4 with simultaneous degradation of
organic amines was carried out in the presence of organic amines in
wastewater as the sacrificial agents. The effects of several factors,
such as organic amine types, pH value, catalyst concentration, organic
amine concentration, and sunlight source, on the photocatalytic activity
of RGO/ZnIn2S4 for H2 production
were investigated. At the same time, its performance of degrading
organic amines during H2 production was also examined.
The results showed that the order of H2 production activity
of RGO/ZnIn2S4 in six organic amine solutions
was N(CH2CH3)3 > N(HOCH2CH2)3 > N(CH3)3 >
HO(CH2)2NH2 > C6H5–N2> CO(NH2)2,
and the highest H2 production was in N(CH2CH3)3 (triethylamine)
solution, being 1597 μmol·g–1·h–1, which is 2.6 times as high as that using the aqueous
solution mixture of Na2S and Na2SO3 as the sacrificial agent. In addition, when the pH was 13, the catalyst
concentration was 1.0 g·L–1, and the triethylamine
concentration was 1.0 mol·L–1, the photocatalytic
activity was the highest. Furthermore, the relationship between triethylamine
concentration and H2 production was analyzed according
to the theory of dynamics.

1 Introduction
With the development of
social economy, the problems of environmental
pollution and energy shortage have become increasingly pressing.1−3 As a promising technology to generate new energy and solve environmental
pollution, photocatalytic water-splitting for H2 production
has received extensive attention.4−15 Currently, organic matters are usually used as sacrificial agents
in the photocatalytic H2 evolution technology because it
can significantly enhance the H2 production efficiency.16−20 Furthermore, using organic pollutants in wastewater as the sacrificial
agent can serve two purposes at the same time: increasing H2 production and simultaneously removing the pollutant via oxidative
decomposition.

Organic amines are common pollutants in the pharmaceutical,
textile,
and dyeing industries wastewater. The organic-amine-contaminated wastewater
is high-nitrogen, poisonous, and difficult to biodegrade, thus threatening
to the environment and human health. However, it is worth noting that
the organic amines can be used as the effective sacrificial agents
for photocatalytic H2 production. In 2004, Wu et al.21 studied the mechanism of oxygen-free photocatalytic
H2 production by TiO2 in ethanolamine solution;
the results showed that ethanolamine used as electron donor could
improve H2 production by TiO2. In 2007, Yin
et al.22 studied photocatalytic H2 production by TiO2 in three different ethanolamine solutions;
it was found that H2 production with these three types
of ethanolamine as the electron donors was much higher than that without
electron donors, and the order of H2 production in these
solutions was triethanolamine > diethanolamine > monoethanolamine.
In 2012, Li et al.23 used ZnIn2S4 as the catalyst for photocatalytic H2 production
in triethylamine solution; it was found that using triethylamine as
an electron donor significantly increased the H2 production
rate. In 2014, Peng et al.24 studied photocatalytic
H2 production by ZnIn2S4 in the presence
of three kinds of methylamine solutions; the results showed that the
H2 production activity of the catalyst was improved by
using three types of methylamine as the electron donors; the activities
of ZnIn2S4 in the three solutions was trimethylamine
> dimethylamine > monomethylamine. The current reports mainly
focus
on the study of using organic amines as sacrificial agents to enhance
photocatalytic H2 production. Using organic amines in the
wastewater as sacrificial agents to promote photocatalytic hydrogen
evolution not only can achieve efficient conversion of pollutants
and recovery of resource in water, but also can effectively prevent
the organic-amine-contaminated wastewater to pollute the environment.
However, the hydrogen production and simultaneous degradation of organic
amines is rarely reported. Therefore, it is of great significance
to study the simultaneous H2 production and organic amine
degradation with organic amines as sacrificial agents.

The previous
study25 of our research
group showed that RGO/ZnIn2S4 has excellent
photocatalytic H2 production activity and stability under
visible light. Based on the previous research on RGO/ZnIn2S4, in this work, the effects of several factors, such
as organic amine species, pH value, catalyst concentration, organic
amine concentration, and solar light source, on the photocatalytic
hydrogen production activity of RGO/ZnIn2S4 were
investigated, and then investigation was carried out about the degradation
of organic amines in wastewater in the process of photocatalytic H2 production. Furthermore, the relationship between triethylamine
concentration and H2 production was analyzed according
to the theory of dynamics.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effects of Organic Amine Types on Photocatalytic
H2 Production
Figure 1 shows the photocatalytic H2 production
efficiency with different types of organic amines (urea, aniline,
ethanolamine, triethanolamine, trimethylamine, and triethylamine)
as sacrificial agents. For comparison, the H2 production
efficiency on the conditions of using Na2S–Na2SO3 as the sacrificial agent, without the sacrificial
agent (pure water), and using triethylamine without catalyst were
also performed and are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Photocatalytic H2 production in different types
of organic
amine solutions.

As can be seen from Figure 1, in the absence
of RGO/ZnIn2S4, the
H2 production rate in the presence of 1.0 mol·L–1 triethylamine was 16 μmol·g–1·h–1, which could be ignored in comparison
with that obtained using RGO/ZnIn2S4. In the
solution containing only water molecules, the H2 production
rate by RGO/ZnIn2S4 was almost zero; however,
by adding triethylamine at a concentration of 1.0 mol·L–1, the H2 production was greatly improved. This is mainly
because in the solution containing only water molecules, although
the RGO could transfer electrons well, the holes (h+) on
the surface were not well transferred or consumed, thus making the
holes and electrons easy to recombine, leading to the almost zero
H2 production; however, after adding triethylamine in the
solution, the holes (h+) were consumed through the oxidation
reaction with the triethylamine adsorbed on the surface of RGO/ZnIn2S4, thus reducing the hole and electron recombination,
making the H2 production greatly improved. At the same
time, triethylamine was eventually decomposed into carbon dioxide,
ammonia, and water.22 In addition, when
triethylamine was used as the sacrificial agent, the H2 production reached 1597 μmol·g–1·h–1, which was 2.6 times as high as that obtained using
the aqueous solution mixture of Na2S and Na2SO3 as the sacrificial agent.

It can also be seen
from Figure 1 that
when the organic amine concentration was 1.0
mol·L–1, the catalyst concentration was 1.0
g·L–1, and the solution pH was 13, the order
of H2 production rate in the six organic amines was triethylamine
(N(CH2CH3)3) > triethanolamine
((HOCH2CH2)3N) > trimethylamine
(N(CH3)3) > ethanolamine (HO(CH2)2NH2) > aniline (C6H5–N2) > urea (CO(NH2)2).
Among them, the activity
order of N(CH2CH3)3 > (HOCH2CH2)3N > HO(CH2)2NH2 was consistent with the results reported by Li et
al.23 According to Li, because of the strong
electronegativity
of the N atom, the electron density cloud of the adjacent −CH2– is reduced, making it vulnerable to be attacked by
hydroxyl radical; in addition, the N atom and the photocatalyst can
form a stable coordination bond, so that N(CH2CH3)3 can be easily adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst
and can be easily degraded by photocatalysis.23 The combined effect makes the h+ easier to consume, the
recombination rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs
much lower, and the H2 production greatly improved. As
for (HOCH2CH2)3N in the present study
because the electronegativity of the O atom (3.44) in it was stronger
than that of the N atom (3.04), the electrons at the N atom and the
−CH2– were shifted toward the O atom, which
increased the electron density cloud of −CH2–
near the O atom. As a result, the ability of hydroxyl radical to attack
−CH2– weakened, which made the photocatalytic
H2 production in (HOCH2CH2)3N solution lower than that in N(CH2CH3)3. For N(CH3)3, the stability of its
−CH3 was stronger than that of its −CH2–, so its ability of being oxidized by hydroxyl radicals
was weakened, which caused the photocatalytic H2 production
lower than that in (HOCH2CH2)3N solution.
As for CO(NH2)2 and C6H5–N2, the former contained the p−π
conjugation formed by the carbonyl group and two −NH2, whereas the latter contained the p−π conjugation formed
by the benzene ring and N atoms; the conjugated structure made the
internal energy in the molecules reduced, so that the molecules tended
to be stable. Therefore, they were difficult to be oxidized by hydroxyl
radicals, so that their recombination of the photon hole–electron
pair greatly increased, resulting in the H2 production
being almost zero.

2.2 Effects of Reaction Conditions
on H2 Production When Using Triethylamine as Sacrificial
Agent
2.2.1 Effects of the pH Values of the Solutions
on H2 Production
Figure 2 shows the photocatalytic H2 production
efficiency with N(CH2CH3)3 as the
sacrificial agent at the solutions with different pH values (2, 7,
9, 11, 13, 14). It can be seen that the H2 production was
zero under either neutral or acidic conditions; when the pH was 9,
H2 production increased; when the pH was 13, the H2 production efficiency was the highest; as the pH continued
to increase, H2 production dropped sharply. These results
are mainly because, at different pH values, N(CH2CH3)3 was adsorbed on the catalyst surface in different
forms. When the pH of the solution was acidic or neutral (where the
solution pH was adjusted with HCl), N(CH2CH3)3 was more likely to combine with hydrochloric acid to
form triethylamine hydrochloride, which reduced the amount of triethylamine
adsorbed on the catalyst surface, thus increasing the recombination
rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, hence reducing
H2 production to a very low level or even zero. However,
when the pH of the N(CH2CH3)3 solution
was 13, most of the N(CH2CH3)3 existed
in molecular form, which could be well adsorbed on the surface of
the catalyst, so as to accelerate the separation of photogenerated
electron–hole pairs, thus greatly improving H2 production.
When the pH of N(CH2CH3)3 was higher
than 13, the reduction potential of H+/H2 became
very low and was not conducive to the generation of H2,
resulting in a sharp decrease in H2 production.

Figure 2 Photocatalytic
H2 production with triethylamine as sacrificial
agent at different pH values.

2.2.2 Effects of the Concentration of RGO/ZnIn2S4 on H2 Production
Figure 3 shows the photocatalytic
H2 production efficiency with N(CH2CH3)3 as the sacrificial agent at different RGO/ZnIn2S4 dosages (0.05–2.0 g·L–1). It can be seen that, with the increase of catalyst concentration,
the corresponding H2 production showed a trend of increasing
first and then decreasing; in particular, when the concentration was
1.0 g·L–1, H2 production was the
highest. This result is mainly because when the RGO/ZnIn2S4 concentration (0.05 g·L–1) was
low, the reaction active sites of the catalyst were less, so it could
not fully and effectively use the light energy, leading to low H2 production; when the RGO/ZnIn2S4 concentration
gradually increased to 1.0 g·L–1, the reaction
active sites of the catalyst increased as well, the catalyst could
fully and effectively use the light energy to contact and react with
N(CH2CH3)3, which increased the H2 production; when the concentration of RGO/ZnIn2S4 continued to increase, the over high concentration
caused shading, which reduced the efficiency of the catalyst to accept
photons, leading to a decrease in the H2 production.

Figure 3 Photocatalytic
H2 production with triethylamine as the
sacrificial agent at different RGO/ZnIn2S4 dosages.

2.2.3 Effects
of Triethylamine Concentrations
on H2 Production
Figure 4 shows the photocatalytic H2 production
efficiency with N(CH2CH3)3 of different
concentrations (0.01–4.0 mol·L–1) as
sacrificial agents. As can be seen from Figure 4, with the increase of N(CH2CH3)3 concentration, the corresponding H2 production showed a tendency to increase first and then decrease,
with the highest appearing at the concentration of 1.0 mol·L–1. This result is mainly because when the N(CH2CH3)3 concentration was lower than 1.0
mol·L–1, 1.0 g·L–1 of
the catalyst was not fully used; as the concentration increased from
0.1 to 1.0 mol·L–1, the utilization of the
catalyst in the unit time was improved, so that the corresponding
H2 production gradually increased; when the N(CH2CH3)3 concentration was higher than 1.0 mol·L–1, the surface active sites of RGO/ZnIn2S4 were limited, so H2 production was gradually
reduced.

concentrations as sacrificial agents.

2.3 Photocatalytic Test under Sunlight
Figure 5a shows the
photocatalytic H2 production with sunlight as a light source,
the corresponding light intensities of which are shown in Figure 5b. The test conditions
were as follows: 1.0 mol·L–1 of N(CH2CH3)3, 1.0 g·L–1 of
catalyst, and the solution pH was 13. The solar-light-driven experiments
were carried out for 3 days, between 9:25 and 17:25 each day on August
16 to August 18, 2015, at the E building roof of the Harbin Institute
of Technology (Shenzhen), which is located in Shenzhen, China (N 22.59°,
E 113.97°). As can be seen from Figure 5a, for the first 5 h of the reaction, all
H2 production by RGO/ZnIn2S4 in the
3 days showed a tendency to increase gradually; at 14:25, all H2 production rates of the 3 days reached the maximum, that
is 265, 121, and 423 μmol·g–1·h–1, respectively. When the reaction time exceeded 5
h, H2 production basically remained unchanged in a range
of error. This is mainly because after 14:25, the intensity of the
sunlight weakened, so that the photocatalytic reaction tended to stop.
In addition, as can be seen from Figure 5a, H2 production of the 3 days
differed significantly, with the production order being day 3 >
day
1 > day 2. This is because within the first 5 h of the photocatalytic
hydrogen production process, the sunlight intensity on day 3 was higher
than that on either day 1 or day 2 and remained on a high level, so
the H2 production on day 3 was the highest; and the sunlight
intensity on day 1 increased gradually and was correspondingly higher
than that on day 2, so that the H2 production rate on day
1 was higher than on day 2. It can be seen that the light intensity
had a significant effect on H2 production by the catalyst.
It is worth noting that, although this experiment was carried out
in the winter, in the case of strong sunlight, the H2 production
activity of the catalyst could be up to 26% of laboratory (350 W Xe
lamp) results.

2.4 Kinetic Study of H2 Production
Using Low-Concentration Triethylamine as Sacrificial Agent
Taking into account that the actual concentration of N(CH2CH3)3 in wastewater is not high, this study
selected low-concentration (0.01–0.2 mol·L–1) N(CH2CH3)3 wastewater as the reaction
solution to look at its degradation in the process of photocatalytic
H2 production. Figure 6a,b show the simultaneous H2 production
and the N(CH2CH3)3 degradation when
using the low-concentration N(CH2CH3)3 as the sacrificial agent. As shown in Figure 6a, when the N(CH2CH3)3 concentration was low, with the increase of N(CH2CH3)3 concentration, the corresponding
H2 production showed a gradually rising trend. As can be
seen from Figure 6b,
with the increase of N(CH2CH3)3 concentration,
although the degradation rate of N(CH2CH3)3 gradually decreased, the total degradation amount gradually
increased instead. It can be seen that when N(CH2CH3)3 in the wastewater was used as the sacrificial
agent, hydrogen production and degradation of N(CH2CH3)3 can occur simultaneously.

low trimethylamine-concentration solutions and the corresponding kinetics
analysis. (a) H2 production in low trimethylamine-concentration
solution; (b) degradation of trimethylamine in different trimethylamine-concentration
solutions; (c) kinetic analysis.

Figure 6c
shows
the kinetic analysis of the effect of N(CH2CH3)3 concentration on H2 production. As can be
seen from Figure 6c,
after linear transformation, H2 production was linear with
the change of C6H15N concentration. The line
met the characteristics of the Langmuir equation  where r, C, k, K are the hydrogen production
rate, triethylamine concentration, surface reaction rate constant,
and apparent adsorption equilibrium constant, respectively. By calculation,
the apparent reaction constant k is 1.64 × 10–4 mol·h–1, the apparent adsorption
equilibrium constant K is 5.97 × 10–3 L·mol–1, and R2 is 0.995.

2.5 Photocatalytic Oxidation Mechanism of Triethylamine
The detection of main oxides in a photocatalytic process is of
great significance to reveal the photocatalytic mechanism. In the
presence of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, hydroxyl radical
scavenger), 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ, superoxide radical scavenger), or
disodium acetate (EDTA–2Na, hole scavenger), the main oxidation
products in the photocatalytic degradation of triethylamine were detected
by free radical and hole trapping experiments. As shown in Figure 7a, under visible
light irradiation, the photodegradation rate of triethylamine decreased
slightly with the addition of TBA and BQ, indicating that the hydroxyl
radical and superoxide radical were not the main active substances
for the degradation of triethylamine in these photocatalytic systems.
However, the photodegradation rate of triethylamine decreased significantly
with the addition of EDTA–2Na. The above results show that
the holes play a major role in the degradation of triethylamine in
RGO/ZnIn2S4 photocatalytic systems under visible
light irradiation.

Figure 7 (a) Trapping experiments of the active species during
the photocatalytic
degradation of triethylamine over RGO/ZnIn2S4 sample under visible light irradiation. (b) Proposed photocatalytic
mechanism of RGO/ZnIn2S4.

Based on the above experimental results, the degradation
mechanism
of triethylamine in RGO/ZnIn2S4 photocatalysis
was proposed and is shown in Figure 7b. When ZnIn2S4 is irradiated
with visible light, electrons will be excited to the conduction bands
(CB), whereas holes will remain in the valence bands (VB). The electrons
in the CB rapidly transported to the surface of Pt particles through
RGO, and reacted with H2O to produce H2. Holes
in the VB reacted with triethylamine and degraded them.

3 Conclusions
The presence of organic amine can promote
hydrogen production from
decomposition of water. The order of H2 generation activity
of RGO/ZnIn2S4 in six organic amine solutions
was N(CH2CH3)3 > N(HOCH2CH2)3 > N(CH3)3 >
HO(CH2)2NH2 > C6H5–N2> CO(NH2)2,
and the highest H2 production was in N(CH2CH3)3 solution,
being 1597 μmol·g–1·h–1, 2.6 times as high as that by using the aqueous solution mixture
of Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial
agent. In addition, when the pH was 13, the catalyst concentration
was 1.0 g·L–1, and the N(CH2CH3)3 concentration was 1.0 mol·L–1, the photocatalytic activity was the highest. When N(CH2CH3)3 in wastewater is used as sacrificial
agent, hydrogen production and degradation of N(CH2CH3)3 can occur simultaneously. The holes play a major
role in the degradation of N(CH2CH3)3 in RGO/ZnIn2S4 photocatalytic systems under
visible light irradiation; the relationship between the concentration
of N(CH2CH3)3 and H2 production
was in accordance with the Langmuir equation.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
All chemicals were of analytical
grade and used as received without further purification. In(NO3)3·4H2O, ZnSO4·7H2O, H2O2 (30%), thioacetamide (TAA),
potassium permanganate (K2MnO4), H2SO4 (purity ≥98%), NaNO3, absolute ethanol,
glycerol, and organic amines(including triethylamine, triethanolamine,
trimethylamine, ethanolamine, aniline, and urea) were purchased from
Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. Na2S and Na2SO3 (purity ≥99.99%) were purchased from
Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. H2PtCl6·6H2O (purity ≥99.99%) was purchased
from Shanghai July Chemical Co., Ltd., China. Graphite was purchased
from Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., China.

4.2 Preparation of RGO/ZnIn2S4
The
RGO/ZnIn2S4 sample was prepared
by an alcohothermal method. The preparation steps are consistent with
the optimal procedure for the preparation of RGO/ZnIn2S4 in our previous work25 and are
only briefly described herein.

For the synthesis of GO, graphite
powder (5 g) and KMnO4 (20 g) were added into a flask (500
mL); then the mixture was vigorously stirred at 10 °C for 30
min and at 35 °C for 5 h, until a thick paste formed. Then, the
mixture was diluted by deionized water (300 mL), treated with ultrasonic
for 3 h, and diluted with distilled water (200 mL). The residual KMnO4 was destroyed through reduction by H2O2 (20 mL, 30%). Subsequently, the mixture was sufficiently washed
with dilute HCl solution (5%) and deionized water. After drying in
an air oven at 65 °C overnight, GO powder was obtained. The GO
powder was then dispersed in absolute ethanol and washed 3 times with
absolute ethanol, then a GO suspension was obtained. The as-prepared
GO suspension was used directly in the next synthesis procedure.

For the synthesis of ZnIn2S4, ZnSO4·7H2O (0.735 g), In(NO3)3·4H2O (1.903 g), and TAA were dissolved in the solution mixed
by absolute ethanol (40 mL) and glycerol (10 mL). The mixed solution
(solution-1) was stirred for 30 min and then hydrothermally treated
at 180 °C for 12 h, then cooled to room temperature naturally.
A yellow precipitate was obtained, then filtered and washed with absolute
ethanol and deionized water three times. After drying in vacuum at
80 °C, ZnIn2S4 was obtained.

For
the synthesis of 0.1 wt % RGO/ZnIn2S4, a desired
amount of GO was dropped into the solution-1 before heating.

4.3 Photocatalytic Reaction
Photocatalytic
tests were carried out in an 868 mL gastight stainless steel reactor.
The specific reactor characteristics were introduced in detail in
our previous work.20,25 The light source was a 350 W
Xe lamp (Shenzhen Stone-lighting Opto Device Co., Ltd., China), and
a cut-off filter was used to remove the UV part of the light (λ
> 420 nm). The light intensity was measured using a spectroradiometer
(FZ-A, Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University).

In all experiments, 200 mL deionized water containing a desired
amount of catalyst (0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 g·L–1) and organic amine(0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.08, 0.1, 0.2,
0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0 mol·L–1) was added
into the reactor. Before light irradiation, argon gas was bubbled
through the reaction mixture for 30 min to remove air from the reaction
solution. Pt as a cocatalyst for the promotion of hydrogen evolution
was photodeposited in situ on the photocatalyst from the precursor
of H2PtCl6·6H2O, when there
was special instruction. Hydrogen evolution was analyzed with a gas
chromatograph (Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument Co.,
Ltd., GC-112A). Samples were taken at intervals of 60 min at 500 μL.
Degradation of organic amines was analyzed in a high performance liquid
chromatograph (LC2000, Shanghai Techcomp Instrument Ltd, China) using
a Symmetry C18 column and a mobile phase consisting of 70% methanol
(chromatographic pure) and 30% water. Before light irradiation, the
suspension was stirred for 60 min in the dark to attain adsorption–desorption
equilibrium of the organic amines on the surface of the photocatalyst.
During the reaction, 2 mL suspension was withdrawn from the reaction
vessel every 60 min. The photocatalyst was removed from the suspension
by centrifugation.
