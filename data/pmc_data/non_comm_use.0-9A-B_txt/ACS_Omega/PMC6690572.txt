The conventional acetone–butanol–ethanol
fermentation
process suffers from several key hurdles viz. low solvent titer, insufficient
yield and productivity, and solvent intolerance which largely affect
butanol commercialization. To counteract these issues, the effect
of stimulator, namely, folic acid was investigated in the present
study to improve butanol titer. Folic acid is involved in biosynthesis
of a diverse range of cellular components, which subsequently alter
the amino acid balance. Therefore, different concentrations of folic
acid were screened, and 10 mg/L supplementation resulted in a maximum
butanol production of 10.78 ± 0.09 g/L with total solvents of
18.91 ± 0.21 g/L. Folic acid addition at different time intervals
was also optimized to get additional improvements in final butanol
concentration. Overall, folic acid supplementation resulted in two-fold
increase in butanol concentration and thus could be considered as
a promising strategy to enhance solvent titers.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Butanol has been extensively
used as an industrial intermediate
from past few decades and now attracted public attention for being
an advanced biofuel.1 Based on fuel properties,
butanol shows better compatibility with gasoline as compared to different
liquid fuels.2 However, the traditional
acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) fermentation process has
numerous pitfalls such as complex bioprocess, low butanol concentration,
and end product inhibition.2 Hence, more
research efforts in field of biobutanol production are needed to explore
butanol as next-generation biofuel. Incidentally, various efforts
including mutagenesis, metabolic engineering approaches, and integrated
fermentation with competent product recovery were reported recently
to enhance product titer.3 Moreover, the
metabolic regulation to elevate butanol production has been carried
out by incorporating organic acids and electron carrier together.4

Several researchers have implemented certain
precursors/cofactors/electron
carriers and indeed, considerable successes have been achieved in
raising butanol titer.5,6 Co-culturing of Clostridium acetobutylicum/Saccharomyces
cerevisiae along with butyrate addition has maximized
butanol concentration upto 16.3 g/L which is 46.8% higher than control.7 On the other hand, addition of calcium carbonate
together with yeast extract promotes butanol synthesis to increase
amino acid concentrations, and thereby stimulate cell growth.8 Similarly, butanol concentration can be upregulated
by incorporation of substrate supplements such as butyrate, acetate,
and allopurinol.9 Besides, the pH-controlled
approach could be one of the promising techniques to increase sugar
consumption rate and final solvent titer.10 Nonetheless, butanol toxicity during fermentation is again a key
hurdle that significantly affects process yield and productivity.
Therefore, augmenting strain robustness is of prime importance. Interestingly,
upregulation of heat shock proteins could be helpful in adapting clostridial
strains to high butanol concentration.11 Additionally, few amino acids that are either self-generated or
exogenously incorporated, enhance the cell’s survival rate
and butanol synthesis.12

Attempts
were made in the current study to improve biobutanol production
along with strain tolerance during batch fermentation by supplementing
folic acid in production medium. Folic acid is mainly involved in
the amino acid biosynthesis in microorganisms.13 The micro-organisms metabolically convert folic acid into
tetrahydrofolic acid. This intermediate could then be diverted to
amino acid or purine/thymidine synthesis. Hence, it was thought desirable
to supplement folic acid in the fermentation medium, in order to induce
amino acid generation during ABE biosynthesis. These self-generated
amino acids in growing clostridia eventually trigger the biobutanol
production. Furthermore, folic acid addition at different fermentation
times was also investigated to improve the overall performance with
respect to butanol/acetone (B/A) ratio.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Folic Acid on
Biobutanol Production
Folic acid is a stable synthetic form
of folate, which is required
by prokaryotic/eukaryotic cells for the production of cellular materials.14 Thus in present study, folic acid was incorporated
in the clostridial ABE fermentation medium to investigate its stimulatory
effect. It has been observed that precursors/cofactors/stimulators
are very effective when present at low concentration in the fermentation
medium.15,16 Also, our previous study demonstrated significant
improvement in butanol titer when trace elements were supplemented
in the concentration range of 1–100 mg/L.17 Therefore, folic acid was selectively incorporated in different
concentrations as 1, 10, 50, and 100 mg/L. Figure 1 depicts ABE production under varied folic
acid concentrations.

Figure 1 Effect of folic acid during ABE fermentation by using C. acetobutylicum NRRL B-527 after 120 h.

Interestingly, folic acid supplementation has positively
triggered
ABE fermentation, thus resulting considerable increment in total solvent
production. Control (without folic acid) experiment produced around
6.48 ± 0.14 g/L of butanol with total ABE to be 11.44 ±
0.23 g/L. Conversely, 10 mg/L folic acid supplementation resulted
in maximum butanol production up to 10.78 ± 0.09 g/L with ABE
of 18.91 ± 0.21 g/L. Addition of folic acid beyond 10 mg/L led
to drop in solvent titer, especially because of detrimental effects
at higher concentration. Virk et al.18 also
showed similar detrimental impact on Clostridium elegans ageing because of increased folate synthesis, and bacterial-dependent
chronic toxicity.

The upsurge in solvent concentrations is may
be due to stimulation
of clostridial cells by folic acid for amino acid self-generation.13 It has been reported that effective amino acid
assimilation yields higher butanol level along with a greater B/A
ratio.12 The positive influence of folic
acid was further evaluated by their addition at several fermentation
time intervals.

2.2 Effect of Time-Wise Folic
Acid Addition
Optimized concentration of folic acid (10 mg/L)
was incorporated
at fermentation time intervals of 0, 4, 8, 24, and 31 h. The conventional
clostridial growth profile shows that the exponential phase begins
at 4–6 h which lasts until 32–36 h just before the stationary
phase. C. acetobutylicum are known
to enter in the solventogenic phase after 36 h to initiate ABE production.
Therefore, the folic acid addition was not extended beyond 31 h. As
can be seen in Figure 2, the highest butanol production (12.94 ± 0.09 g/L) was reached
when folic acid was incorporated after 4 h of fermentation. However,
further delay in addition time resulted into relatively lower solvent
production. This is because when microorganisms just start to enter
in the exponential growth phase, their cellular activities are at
peak and additional folic acid can immediately be utilized in butyric
acid production under a favorable acidogenic phase. Interestingly,
notable changes were observed in acetone production, while ethanol
production was slightly altered with different folic acid addition
times. Acetone production was lowered when folic acid was added at
8 and 12 h of fermentation (Figure 2). The lowered acetone production was attributed to
diversion of flux toward butanol.19

Figure 2 Time-course
of folic acid addition in production media of C. acetobutylicum NRRL B-527 with a total fermentation
time of 120 h.

Lowered acetone production obviously
resulted in fluctuation in
the B/A ratio in the presence of folic acid. From Figure 2, it was found that the maximum
B/A ratio (2.27) was reached when folic acid was added after 8 h of
fermentation. Although it was not evaluated in the current study,
it was believed that the lowered acetone flux was eventually transferred
to the butanol production pathway that ultimately improved the butanol
titer. This is evident from the altered butanol/ethanol ratio, especially
because of higher butanol production and steady ethanol accumulation.
Overall, these findings clearly suggest that folic acid incorporation
at the specific clostridial growth phase (beginning of exponential
phase) is essential to elevate butanol titer. Besides, several researchers
also pointed out the effectiveness of “precursor addition time”
for increased biobutanol production.6,17,20 Furthermore, fermentation kinetics of control and
folic acid-supplemented medium were also studied in order to assess
the fermentation performance.

2.3 ABE Fermentation
Profiles in the Presence
of Folic Acid
Folic acid (10 mg/L) was added after 4 h of
clostridial fermentation and ABE profile was studied with respect
to growth, pH, and sugar consumption. The growth and production behavior
of clostridia was significantly affected by addition folic acid with
improved butanol yield and productivity of approximately two-fold.
From Figure 3A, it
was observed that clostridial growth in the presence of folic acid
is consistently higher than control, throughout the fermentation.
A lag period of ∼4 h was observed, in which cells acclimatize
to fermentation conditions. Thereafter, cells enter into exponential
growth phase showing steep increase in cell density. After 48 h, the
stationary phase begun wherein cell growth slowed and maximum solvent
production took place. In control experiment, a similar growth pattern
was observed while cell density was relatively lowered as compared
to folic acid-supplemented medium. Interestingly, the pH profile during
ABE fermentation which is a measure to analyze the shift from the
acidogenic phase to solventogenic phase of clostridia was unaffected
(Figure 3A). This signifies
that, although folic acid was believed to altere cellular activities
of clostridia, it did not significantly change the microbial phase
behavior.

Figure 3 ABE fermentation performance in the presence of folic acid by using C. acetobutylicum NRRL B-527: (A) residual sugar,
pH, and clostridial growth profile; (B) solvent profiles; (C) butanol
yield and productivity: empty symbols with dotted lines represent
control readings, whereas filled symbols with solid lines represent
folic acid added results. The data represent the average of triplicate
determinations with SD < ±0.5%.

Folic acid supplementation resulted into rapid sugar consumption
of around 19% higher than control (Figure 3A). The sugar utilization rate was quite
fast within 24–72 h of fermentation, which can relate to rapid
acid assimilation to solvents. These results are in agreement with
our previous report that demonstrated the addition of nickel chloride
aided almost complete sugar utilization with increased butanol titer.17 Also, incorporation of nicotinic acid has promoted
the glucose consumption rate by ∼9% than the corresponding
control value.21 This increase in consumption
rate is attributed to large amounts of reduced nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NADH) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) generated and subsequently being utilized during
fermentation.

Figure 3B shows
solvent production profiles by C. acetobutylicum NRRL B-527. The highest butanol and ABE as 12.94 ± 0.09 and
23.23 ± 0.17 g/L, respectively, were achieved by folic acid addition.
This improvement is because of variety of amino acid induction that
is solely responsible for increased strain tolerance, thereby better
solvent production.22 These outcomes are
in-line with other studies which showed that overproduction of NADH
and aspartic acid is responsible for the enhanced butanol level in
yeast extract-supplemented cassava medium.23 Luo et al.12 also demonstrated that secretion
of lysine is favorable to C. acetobutylicum’s survival under high butanol concentration. Furthermore,
it was observed that the solvent productions were drastically improved
after 24 h of fermentation (Figure 3B) as a result of the shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis.
Moreover, folic acid incorporation also aided increment in acetone
and ethanol concentrations. Ding et al.20 reported that supplementation of electron receptors (Na2SO4/CaSO4) altered the distribution of electron/proton
in the intracellular electron transport shuttle system to accumulate
amino acids favorable for clostridial survival/butanol synthesis.

Figure 3C emphasizes
variations in specific butanol yield and productivity during the entire
fermentation period. The maximum butanol yield of 0.24 g/g and productivity
of 0.14 g/L·h were achieved in batch fermentation with folic
acid addition. The statistical analysis by using single-factor ANOVA
was performed to evaluate significant difference between studied parameters.
The p value < 0.05 demonstrated that the folic
acid supplementation significantly affected clostridial growth, fermentation
pH, and ABE production profiles positively. ABE fermentation was also
carried out in a bioreactor supplemented with folic acid (after 4
h fermentation). As a result, butanol concentration of 12.31 ±
0.03 g/L with total solvents of 21.50 ± 0.20 g/L was obtained.
Interestingly, folic acid traces were not detected after fermentation
was over (120 h). This clearly implies that folic acid added during
fermentation was utilized as a stimulator to alter essential cellular
components. Previously, folic acid supplementation altered the C. elegans development and longevity via bacterial
uptake of breakdown products.24 Besides,
vitamins (A, B1, B2, B3, and C) are found to support bacterial growth
which eventually improved butanol titer (21.56 g/L).25 Another study also revealed that two basic vitamins, namely,
biotin and p-aminobenzoic acid are required to maintain
active cell growth.26 Increasing these
vitamin concentrations by 8-fold has triggered growth as well as the
solvent formation rate. Similarly, other medium precursors have also
been reported to elevate the butanol production (Table 1). This study will be continued
further with several bioprocess modifications such as fed-batch and
continuous process monitoring in order to see its large scale feasibility.

3 Conclusions
The biobutanol process, although very old, is
still struggling
to be commercialized for its biofuel application, especially because
of its lower production titers and end production inhibition. Hence,
modification in metabolic stimulators like folic acid is especially
important in order to divert the flux toward butanol production. Current
work shows the importance of metabolic stimulators that affect the
biobutanol production profile in clostridia with improved tolerance
toward solvent toxicity. Butanol production stimulators such as folic
acid increased the overall titer and fermentation performance. The
folic acid supplementation yielded nearly two-fold rise in butanol
concentration, thus reaching specific butanol yield of 0.24 g/g. This
study also detailed an impact of folic acid addition time on butanol
production and B/A ratio. Furthermore, fermentation profiles demonstrated
that butanol production was greatly triggered in the stationary phase
of clostridia. Maximum butanol concentration of 12.94 ± 0.09
g/L was achieved in presence of folic acid. Incidentally, the current
study supported the butanol production pathway with addition of folic
acid which is a precursor to many amino acid biosynthesis in microorganisms.
The specific upsurge in butanol concentration with the help of folic
acid would be an alternative and feasible approach which can be implemented
with further modifications to strengthen ABE fermentation economics.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Clostridial Strain and
Its Maintenance
The bacterium, C. acetobutylicum NRRL
B-527 was obtained from ARS (Agricultural Research Services) Culture
Collection, USA. Freeze-dried cells were stimulated in sterile revival
media (RM) containing (g/L): glucose (5.0), beef extract (10), yeast
extract (3.0), peptone (10), sodium chloride (5.0), sodium acetate
(3.0), soluble starch (1.0), l-cysteine hydrochloride (0.5),
and resazurin (0.001), at pH 6.8. The RM culture bottles were incubated
at 37 ± 2 °C for 48 h. Furthermore, the clostridial spore
suspension was prepared according to Nimbalkar et al.29 and used whenever required.

4.2 Inoculum
and Production Media
The
seed culture was prepared by inoculating 2% (v/v) spores in sterile
80 mL-reinforced clostridial medium (RCM) through heat shock treatment.
Further, the RCM culture bottles were kept in an incubator for 18–20
h at 37 °C. The fermentation medium (P2) used in the current
study contained the following (g/L): glucose (60), ammonium acetate
(2.2), dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (0.5), potassium dihydrogen
phosphate (0.5), magnesium sulfate (0.2), p-aminobenzoic
acid (0.1), thiamin (0.1), manganese sulfate (0.01), iron sulfate
(0.01), sodium chloride (0.01), and biotin (0.01) at pH 6.5. The nitrogen
was purged through fermentation media and autoclaved subsequently
at 121 °C for 20 min. Analytical grade chemicals were used in
the present study.

4.3 Fermentation Experiments
The batch
experiments were carried out in 100 mL glass bottles with 80 mL production
medium. Folic acid (at varied concentration range of 1–100
mg/L) was added in the production medium by filter sterilization before
inoculation. Fermentation was initiated by inoculating 5% (v/v) actively
growing clostridial cells and maintained at 37 °C for 120 h.
The standard P2 medium was used as a control. Batch fermentation was
also performed in a 3 L bioreactor (Dhruv Fabrotech, India) fitted
with pH probe, temperature sensor, and working volume of 1.5 L. All
other fermentation conditions for the bioreactor were kept similar
as explained earlier unless otherwise stated. The effect of folic
acid was determined by analyzing samples after each 24 h interval.
The data points were plotted to compare the fermentation performance.
All the experiments were performed at least in triplicate and results
presented are with average value ±standard deviation (SD).

4.4 Analytical Techniques
Total solvents
(acetone, butanol, and ethanol) and acids (acetic acid and butyric
acid) were quantified by analyzing samples in gas chromatography (Agilent
Technologies 7890B) equipped with AB-INNOWax capillary column (30
m × 0.32 mm × 1 mm) and flame ionization detector. The oven
program was set as 90 (5 min hold) to 200 °C at 40 °C/min
rise (5 min hold). The injector (0.5 μL injection volume) and
detector were maintained at 200 and 250 °C, respectively. Unutilized
glucose was determined by the dinitrosalicylic acid method.30 A UV–visible spectrophotometer (3000+,
Labindia) was used to monitor clostridial growth by measuring optical
density at 600 nm. Besides, a fermentation medium pH was also recorded
with the help of a laboratory pH meter (Global, India). Folic acid
concentration after fermentation was estimated according to Matias
et al.31 Statistical analysis (ANOVA) was
also performed to evaluate the significant difference between the
parameters studied.
