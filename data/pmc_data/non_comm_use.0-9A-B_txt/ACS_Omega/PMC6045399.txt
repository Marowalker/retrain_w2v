Self-organized
bacteria have been the subject of interest for a
number of applications, including the construction of microbial fuel
cells. In this paper, we describe the formation of a self-organized,
three-dimensional network that is constructed using Gluconobacter oxydans B-1280 cells in a hydrogel
consisting of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with N-vinyl
pyrrolidone (VP) as a cross-linker, in which the bacterial cells are
organized in a particular side-by-side alignment. We demonstrated
that nonmotile G. oxydans cells are
able to reorganize themselves, transforming and utilizing PVA–VP
polymeric networks through the molecular interactions of bacterial
extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) components such as acetan, cellulose,
dextran, and levan. Molecular dynamics simulations of the G. oxydans EPS components interacting with the hydrogel
polymeric network showed that the solvent-exposed loops of PVA–VP
extended and engaged in bacterial self-encapsulation.

Introduction
Despite recent advances
and technological innovations in microbial
electrochemical technologies, including the bioproduction of biofuel,
waste treatment, and biosensing,1−4 poor electron transfer between microbes and electrodes
is a major concern and a limiting factor for large-scale applications
of the technology.2−4 In light of this drawback, intensive research has
concentrated on understanding the mechanisms responsible for the extracellular
electron transfer (EET) process and on methods by which electrocatalytic
bacteria communicate.2,4−9 It has been discovered that bacteria are able to form “pili-like”
nanowires that facilitate an EET process by linking the respiratory
chains located on membranes of bacterial cells to adjacent external
surfaces, such as oxidized metals in the natural environment, or to
engineered electrodes in renewable energy devices.4,6,8,9 Bacteria utilize
mainly (1) indirect pathways involving redox-active mediators, (2)
primary metabolites or other intermediates, or (3) direct modes, involving
physical contact in which naturally occurring outer-membrane c-type
cytochromes shuttle electrons for the reduction or oxidation of electrodes.10,11 Understanding the electron transfer mechanism is important in allowing
the optimization of the performance of microbial fuel cells.

Geobacter sulfurreducens bacterial
cells have been reported to form pili that serve as biological nanowires
that allow the transfer of electrons from bacterial cell surfaces
to the surface of Fe(III) oxides.6,7 Another metal-reducing
bacteria, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1,8,9 was observed to form nanowires from the extension of their bacterial
outer membrane and periplasm. It was also reported that S. oneidensis MR-1 cells that had been treated with
cisplatin produced elongated cells, which showed approximately a five-fold
improvement in current densities compared to normal, untreated cells.12 Furthermore, filamentous bacteria of the family
Desulfobulbaceae have been found to conduct electricity over centimeter-long
distances, thereby coupling the processes of oxygen reduction at marine
sediment surfaces with sulphite oxidation in subsurface layers.5,13

Gluconobacter oxydans cells
require
redox shuttles to assist the transfer of electrons from the active
sites of cells to electrodes.1,14−17 This Gram-negative, nonmotile bacterium produces periplasmic membrane-bound
pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), which contains complex enzymes that
allow the efficient oxidation of a number of substrates.1,14−16,18−20G. oxydans is a promising candidate
for the construction of efficient microbial fuel cells because of
the periplasmic localization of active sites of PQQ-dependent redox
enzymes.1,14−17,20 In particular, G. oxydans encapsulated
in a confined space showed enhanced levels of electric power generation.14 It remains unclear, however, how the G. oxydans cells were encapsulated within polymeric
hydrogels. In this paper, we report on the three-dimensional (3D)
organization of G. oxydans subsp. industrius
B-1280 cells that are encapsulated within the confined environment
of a hydrogel system constructed from poly(vinyl alcohol) cross-linked
with N-vinyl pyrrolidone (VP).16 The proposed mechanism is supported by experimental evidence
in addition to molecular dynamics simulation for four exopolysaccharides
(acetan, cellulose, dextran, and levan) present on the outer cell
wall of the G. oxydans cells.15,18 Synthetic and analytical chemistry techniques, including ultra-small-angle
neutron scattering (USANS), biological assays and computational modeling
were used to demonstrate that G. oxydans cells were engaged in self-encapsulation and were able to construct
a network by utilizing the molecular components of the PVA–VP
hydrogel. Specifically, we showed that interactions taking place between
bacterial extracellular polysaccharide components and surface loops
of the PVA–VP hydrogel had the greatest influence over the
structure of resultant hydrogel and were able to transform its original
three-dimensional structure into a well-organized biological network.

Results
and Discussion
Three-Dimensional Organization of the PVA–VP
Hydrogels
To understand the way in which the G. oxydans cells are encapsulated within the hydrogel,
an understanding of
the structure of original hydrogel polymeric network is essential.
Therefore, the hydrogel was synthesized through the free radical polymerization
of linear PVA using VP as a cross-linker.14 Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) was used to initiate the chain reaction,
causing the formation of the free radical species shown in Figure 1A. The free oxygen
radicals of PVA were then cross-linked with double bonds present on
VP monomers, leading to the formation of a three-dimensional porous
polymeric network, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
analysis of freeze-fractured hydrogel samples (Figure 1B). X-ray diffraction was previously used
to obtain an insight into the process by which PVA hydrogel porous
structures were formed.21 The results of
this study indicated the presence of entangled swollen amorphous and
crystalline domains of PVA that acted as “bulges” within
the gel network. Raman microspectroscopic imaging of samples also
confirmed the formation of a PVA–VP porous structure within
hydrogel films in their hydrated state (Figure 1B and Figure S1A,B, Supporting Information). The estimated pore diameter distribution of the
resultant hydrogels is presented in Figure 1C. It was found that PVA–VP hydrogels
exhibited a pore diameter of 0.92 ± 0.38 μm and a swelling
ratio of 410% (Figure S1C, Supporting Information), most likely due to the low proportion of crystalline segments
being present in PVA–VP.22,23

alcohol) (PVA) of molecular weight 67 kDa cross-linked with VP. (A)

states using SEM (scale bar 5 μm) and Raman microspectroscopy

G. oxydans Bacterial Cell Network
Formation
The three-dimensional organization of G. oxydans cells in the PVA–VP hydrogels was
visualized using SEM, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and
Raman microspectroscopy (RM) (Figure 2). The examination of the freeze-fractured hydrogels
containing the bacterial cells showed that the original three-dimensional
structure of hydrogels had been completely altered. In the hydrogel
environment, G. oxydans cells were
found to have self-organized into a network (Figure 2A), in contrast to the structure adopted
in the absence of PVA–VP (Figure 1). CLSM and Raman microspectroscopy image
analyses confirmed that the G. oxydans cells had formed a network in the hydrogel (Figure 2B,C). The average biological cluster lengths
were found to be 10.5 ± 6.4 μm, as inferred from the ImageJ
analysis data (Figure 2D).

cells into the biological network in the PVA–VP hydrogel system.

images (scanning areas of approximately 5 × 5 μm2) showing G. oxydans cell clusters.

hydrogel. The kinetics of self-organization of G. oxydans cells in PVA–VP hydrogel was investigated using time-lapsed
microscopy (E) CLSM and (F) USANS. (G) Schematic diagram illustrating
the re-arrangement of bacteria disrupting the polymeric network.

The dynamic formation of the network
by G. oxydans cells in the PVA–VP
hydrogel system was further investigated
using time-lapsed CLSM and USANS (Figure 2E,F). Over the period of an hour, short clusters
of 4–5 cells were found to have formed (Movie S1, Supporting Information). A further elongation
of the short clusters continued after this time for the next 24 h,
resulting in the formation of larger self-assembled clusters (Figure 2F, Figure S2A and
Movie S2, Supporting Information). The
analysis of the USANS spectra showed that the increased intensity
of scattering lengths (q) ranged from 0.5 ×
10–4 to 1.0 × 10–4 Å–1 over the 24 h period, indicating that the G. oxydans cell clusters had become larger. Because
of the complexity and polydispersity of the globular knot complex
structures of PVA–VP together with G. oxydans, further resolving the scattering patterns of USANS was not feasible.
However, the change in scattering intensity gradients of the neutron
beam clearly indicated the cluster formation by G.
oxydans cells. A similar approach was previously used
to identify the formation of the protein clusters, such as those of
monoclonal antibodies.24

To understand
the way in which the G. oxydans cells
interact with the PVA–VP hydrogel system, the hydrogel
was labeled with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-functionalized fluorescent
silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) as described elsewhere25,26 and in Supporting Information S1.1. The
NPs were bound to the OH groups present on the PVA–VP (Figure 3A). The location
of the binding sites of the SiO2 NPs on the PVA–VP
was visualized using CLSM. The CLSM micrographs confirmed the presence
of the original porous three-dimensional (3D) organization of the
cells, as highlighted by the various positions of the SiO2 NPs (Figure 3A).
After the addition of the G. oxydans cells, however, the SiO2 NPs were found to have completely
dissociated from the PVA–VP hydrogel polymeric chains (Figure 3A). These results
suggested that the G. oxydans cells
replaced the SiO2 NPs to occupy the binding sites present
in the PVA–VP (Figure 3B). Notably, after over 70 h of analysis, no statistically
significant change was observed in the pH level of the PVA–VP
hydrogel system (Figure S2B, Supporting Information), thus eliminating the possibility that an alteration in the 3D
organization of the hydrogels with bacterial cells could have occurred
as a consequence of changes in pH.

hypothetical mechanism by which hydrogel polymeric chains and G. oxydans cells interact. Disruption of hydrogen
bond formation between PEG-functionalized SiO2 NPs and

and PVA–VP.

The examination of the
CLSM micrographs revealed that the G. oxydans cells had secreted an extracellular polymeric
material (Figure S1E, Supporting Information) and had adopted a characteristic but partial side-by-side orientation
within the clusters being formed (Figure 2B and Figure S1F, Supporting Information). Markedly, when Escherichia coli K12 cells were introduced into the PVA–VP hydrogel, no self-organized
clusters were detected (Figure S3, Supporting Information). To the best of our knowledge, a side-by-side
alignment in a hydrogel matrix has only been reported for nonbiological,
ellipsoidal microparticles.27 Examples
of self-oriented electroactive cells reported in the literature include
the pili or pili-like nanowires formed by S. oneidensis(8,9,12,28) and filamentous bacteria of the family Desulfobulbaceae, which can
undergo cable-like alignment.5,13 It has also been reported
that nonelectroactive bacteria such as Lactobacillus
fermentum and Bifidobacterium breve have been able to align themselves in response to the application
of an external magnetic field after being coated with maghemite nanoparticles.29 In addition to these reports, some artificial
systems have been developed to mediate the aggregation of nonelectroactive
bacteria through the modification of the surfaces of bacterial cells.30,31

Biocatalytic Activity of G. oxydans Cell Clusters
The encapsulated G. oxydans cell clusters in PVA–VP hydrogels required only 20–30
min to generate 90.0 mV/mg, whereas freely suspended bacteria generated
lower electricity (48.0 mV/mg) after 60–70 min (Table S1, Supporting Information). The microbial fuel cell
containing the encapsulated G. oxydans cells was able to maintain the generated electrical potential over
a period of 8 days (Figure S4, Supporting Information), whereas the electric potential generated by the suspended cells
has been reported to be stable only for a 24 h period. The conductivity
of the bacterial network was estimated to be 0.32 mS/m, which is much
higher than that of freely suspended bacteria (0.11 mS/m) (Table S1, Supporting Information). Cyclic voltammograms
(CVs) were recorded using bare graphite electrodes with freely suspended
bacteria in the electrochemical cell and at the PVA–VP-encapsulated G. oxydans-modified electrode (Figure 4). These voltammograms highlighted a significant
difference between the two systems. It is suggested that the improved
performance of the microbial fuel cells constructed using the encapsulated G. oxydans clusters resulted in the increased efficiency
in the transfer of extracellular electrons between bacterial clusters.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation of G. oxydans Extracellular Polysaccharide Components Interacting with the Hydrogel
Polymeric Network
The outer cell wall of the G. oxydans cells is surrounded by an extracellular
polysaccharide (EPS) capsule, which typically contains several polysaccharide
units, including acetan, cellulose, dextran, and levan.15,18 Because the contact between the G. oxydans cells and the PVA–VP hydrogel occurs via the EPS, all-atom
model heptamers of the four EPS components were constructed and solvated
with explicit water, and their interaction with the model PVA–VP
hydrogel was then simulated as a function of time (Figure 5A and Table S2, Supporting Information).

The mesoporous poly(vinyl alcohol)–N-vinylpyrrolidone (PVA–VP) hydrogel model was constructed
from 5 atactic oligomers of 23 monomer units with a molar ratio of
22:1 VA/VP, which were randomly packed into a confined layer using
the Theodorou–Suter algorithm.32,33 Following
packing, the oligomer termini were attached to the nearest adjacent
terminus to create an infinite polymer surface. The system was then
solvated with a water volume to reproduce the experimental concentration
of polymer in water of 54.9 mg/mL and simulated using molecular dynamics
(MD) for 200 ns to relax the system. The heptamers of acetan, bacterial
cellulose, dextran, and levan were constructed, solvated, and simulated
for at least 50 ns to relax the structures. Following relaxation of
the polymer hydrogel and polysaccharide heptamers, each polysaccharide
was positioned in a 40 × 50 × 70 Å3 unit
cell containing the solvated polymer with a minimum distance of 10
Å to the polymer surface to examine the polymer–hydrogel
interactions.

Of the four model EPS components, acetan was found
to have the
greatest influence over the structure of the hydrogel (Figure 5B). Specifically, the solvent-exposed
loops of the PVA–VP (shown in light green in Figure 6B and Movie S3, Supporting Information) extended away from the
hydrogel surface and bulk phase, and polymer–polymer interactions
were replaced by polymer–EPS interactions. The mechanism of
the PVA–VP deformation was characterized by the presence of
initially metastable direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds being
formed between the acetan and a loop of the PVA–VP (Figure 6). The formation
of hydrogen bonds coincided with a breakage of the hydrogen bonds
between the exposed polymer loops and the polymer surface, which was
accompanied by an increase in the conformational entropy as the loop
moved away from the bulk of the polymer. This was followed by additional
rearrangements of the loop to maximize the short-range interactions
with the acetan molecules. The strong specific interactions taking
place between the acetan (and to a lesser extent the other three EPS
components) and the loops of the PVA–VP through hydrogen bond
formation and van der Waals forces (Figure 6 and Movie S3, Supporting Information) may explain how the bacterial outer layer was
able to interact with and modify the structure of the PVA–VP
as well as displace the SiO2 NPs from the hydrogel.

the hydrogen bond formation taking place between acetan and PVA–VP
loops on a molecular scale (oxygen atoms are colored red, PVA–VP

and hydrogen bonding colored purple with dashed lines).

Of the four polysaccharides studied, acetan
was found to perturb
the structure of the PVA–VP hydrogel to the greatest extent,
followed by cellulose (Figure 5, Table S2, Supporting Information). Levan exhibited the least effect on the hydrogel. Cellulose remained
the most extended polysaccharide throughout the simulations, maintaining
a radius of gyration (Rg) of 10.6 ±
0.3 Å, followed by acetan (7.4 ± 1.4 Å). Acetan, however,
exhibited the greatest fraction of the contact surface area with the
PVA–VP and provided the highest population of polysaccharide–polymer
hydrogen bonds of any of the polysaccharides being studied (Table
S2, Supporting Information). Interestingly,
the interaction energy decomposition analysis indicated that only
approximately 25% of the interaction enthalpy between the acetan and
PVA–VP was due to the contribution from electrostatic interactions,
whereas the remaining contribution was due to van der Waals interactions.
We emphasize that this is a conceptual and representative model of
the interactions between the polysaccharides present in the bacterial
outer layer and the PVA–VP hydrogel, and all four polysaccharides
studied exhibited similar behavior and are capable, in principle,
of modifying the polymer structure to some extent. It is likely that
all bacterial polysaccharides act cooperatively, causing the withdrawal
of individual chains from the polymer bulk, effectively “melting”
the polymer network and creating an arrangement favorable to the bacteria.

Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge this is the first
study that reports
the self-organization of G. oxydans cells into a biological network by actively utilizing the properties
of the PVA–VP hydrogel system in which it is contained. Here,
we demonstrated that the self-organization of the G.
oxydans cells occurs through the formation of an extended
network of bacterial cells aligned in a partial side-by-side configuration
to form biological clusters. This particular orientation was most
likely adopted to facilitate the efficient transfer of electrons,
because it results in an increased interaction contact area. The alignment
of the G. oxydans cells in the polymeric
hydrogel allowed the microbial fuel cells containing them to generate
a greater electric potential than that obtained by suspended G. oxydans cells in the absence of the hydrogel.
The power generation of the PVA–VP/G. oxydans system was found to be stable for more than 8 days. A remarkable
feature of the G. oxydans cells is
their ability to utilize the PVA–VP hydrogel system to self-encapsulate
and self-organize into an extended network via strong specific intermolecular
interactions between the polysaccharides present on the exopolysaccharide
capsules and the exposed loops of the PVA–VP polymer. This
process has the potential to be exploited in the novel design of highly
efficient electricity generation cells that utilize components of
industrial organic waste.

Materials and Methods
Hydrogel Synthesis
Poly(vinyl alcohol) samples, with
molecular weights of 67 kDa (Sigma-Aldrich), were used to form a hydrogel
using VP as the cross-linking agent. More details regarding the synthetic
procedure for these hydrogels is described in Supporting Information S1.1.

Poly(ethylene oxide)-functionalized
fluorescent nanoparticles (of diameter approximately 15 nm) were prepared
and incorporated into the hydrogel as detailed in Supporting Information S1.1. These were used to characterize
the porous cellular microstructure of the hydrogels and to investigate
the interactions taking place between the bacteria and the hydrogel.26 The swelling behavior of the PVA–VP hydrogels
in Milli-Q water was studied and reported in terms of the swelling
ratio (Q), where Q = swollen mass/initial
dry hydrogel mass.26 The detailed procedure
is described in Supporting Information S1.1. The synthesis of PVA–VP and nanoparticle-immobilized PVA–VP
is described elsewhere14,26 and detailed in Supporting Information S1.2.

Encapsulation of G. oxydans and E. coli Bacterial Cells in Hydrogels
G. oxydans subsp. industrius VKM B-1280 was obtained
from Russian Culture Collection from Skryabin Institute of Biochemistry
and Physiology of Microorganisms, Russian Academy of Science. The G. oxydans cells were grown at 30 °C in a medium
of the following composition: 200.0 g/L d-sorbitol (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 20.0 g/L yeast extract (BD, USA). E. coli K12, used for comparative purposes in CLSM studies, was grown in
nutrient broth (Oxoid). The bacterial cells were stored in stock solutions
prepared with the same medium containing 20% glycerol. The stock samples
(1 mL tubes) were stored at −80 °C. The bacterial cultures
were refreshed prior to use on agar plates incubated at 30 °C
for 48 h.

Prior to the encapsulation process, cells were harvested
after a 48 h incubation period and washed twice with 18.0 mM phosphate–citrate
buffer (pH 6.0). Wet cell pellets were mixed with the hydrogel solutions
to obtain a final concentration of 30 mg/mL. The mixture was stirred
for 24 h, after which time the mixture was progressively diluted to
obtain the final concentration of 6 mg/mL. Hydrogel films were prepared
by casting approximately 300 μL of the diluted mixture onto
a glass slide and allowing it to dry at 25 °C for 24 h. The same
process of E. coli encapsulation was
carried out with 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4). A functional analysis of the
constructed microbial fuel cell (MFC) with the encapsulated G. oxydans is given in Supporting Information S1.3.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
The
synthetic hydrogels
prepared with and without the G. oxydans cells were characterized using SEM (ZEISS SUPRA 40VP, Oberkochen,
BW, Germany) at 3 kV under 5000×, 10 000×, 50 000×
magnification. Freeze-dried and fractured hydrogel films with and
without bacteria were mounted on an L-shaped aluminum holder using
a conductive tape and gold-sputtered as previously described.26

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman microspectroscopy
of the PVA–VP
hydrogels with and without G. oxydans was mapped using a Raman microspectrometer (WITec) with a 532 nm
laser wavelength (hν = 2.33 eV). A 100×
objective was used to characterize the hydrogel samples. A grid of
50 spectra × 50 spectra was acquired for a scanning area of 5
μm × 5 μm. The integration time for a single spectrum
was 2.0 s. Scanning was repeated independently using three different
samples. Visualization of the G. oxydans bacterial cell clusters in the PVA–VP was performed without
using the freeze-drying preparation steps used for imaging via CLSM
and Raman microspectroscopy.

Ultra-Small-Angle Neutron Scattering Spectroscopy
Ultra-small-angle
neutron scattering (USANS) was performed using the Kookaburra beamline
at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO,
NSW, Australia) to determine the microstructure of the PVA–VP
hydrogels with and without the G. oxydans being present. Two perfect channel-cut crystals were used to measure
the broadening of a monochromatic neutron beam with a wavelength of
4.74 Å, thus measuring the small-angle scattering from a sample
placed between them, allowing a range of momentum transfer quantities
to be utilized. The scattering length, q, was calculated
according to the following equation 1  where q (Å–1) is the scattering length; λ (nm)
is the wavelength of incident
neutrons; and θ (rad) is the scattering angle.

A q range of 3 × 10–5 to 3 × 10–3 Å–1 was used to investigate
the self-assembled structure formed between the hydrogel and G. oxydans over a 36 h period. The samples were contained
in a 2 mm path length fused quartz cell with an aperture of 35 mm
× 35 mm. Data were reduced using standard procedures that involved
the determination of the transmission with respect to an empty cell
and normalized in addition to subtraction of the background scattering
from the empty sample cell. Incoherent scattering from water, which
was approximately 0.8 cm–1, was considered an insignificant
contribution to the background spectra over the range being studied.

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy
Confocal laser scanning
microscopy was used to visualize the proportion of live and dead cells
using a LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit, L7012, which contained
a mixture of SYTO 9 and propidium iodide fluorescent dyes (Molecular
Probes, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). SYTO 9 permeated both
intact and damaged membranes of the cells, binding to nucleic acids
and fluorescing green when excited by a 485 nm wavelength laser. The
propidium iodide entered only the cells that had sustained significant
membrane damage, and hence considered to be nonviable, and binds with
a higher affinity to the nucleic acids within the cells than does
the SYTO 9. Bacterial suspensions were stained according to the method
previously reported26 and imaged using
a FluoView FV10i inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Molecular
Dynamics (MD) Model Construction
The published
parameters from the condensed-phase optimized molecular potentials
for atomistic simulation studies (COMPASS) force field35 were applied to all systems, with missing angles
and dihedrals taken from the polymer consistent force field (PCFF).36 We have used both COMPASS and PCFF previously
to model solvated polymer interactions,37 and this family of force fields has been shown to be reliable for
modeling polymers and interfaces.38−41 All simulations were run in the
MD code LAMMPS34 in the constant pressure
and temperature (NPT) ensemble with the Nosé–Hoover
thermostat and barostat to maintain a temperature of 298 K and a pressure
of 1 atm and utilized a 1 fs timestep and 10 ps output frequency.
Electrostatics beyond a 15.5 Å cutoff were treated with the PPPM
summation method with an accuracy of 1 × 10–5 kcal/mol and van der Waals interactions with an atom-based summation
utilizing a 15.5 Å cutoff and tail correction. All simulations
were run for up to 300 ns, with at least three different initial velocity
distributions for each system. Equilibration was defined as the point
where the heavy-atom root mean squared deviation (rmsd) reached a
steady value with a standard deviation of less than 1 Å. All
analyses were performed on 10 ns of equilibrated trajectory. Hydrogen
bonds were calculated with a maximum donor–acceptor distance
of 2.5 Å and a minimum angle of 120°. Atomic density profiles
were created using the VMD Density Profile Tool.42
