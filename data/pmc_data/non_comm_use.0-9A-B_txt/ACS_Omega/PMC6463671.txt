Understanding the factors that give
rise to tau aggregation and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the key aspect in Alzheimer’s
disease pathogenesis. Microtubule (MT) binding repeats of tau protein
were suggested to play a critical role in tau aggregation. Here, we
show that the interaction of Cu2+ with full-length MT binding
repeats R1–R4 leads to the aggregation, and a Cys-based redox
chemistry is critically involved in tau aggregation leading to disulfide-bridge
dimerization of R2 and R3 and further aggregation into a fibrillar
structure. Notably, ascorbate and glutathione, the most abundant antioxidants
in neurons, cannot prevent the effect of Cu2+ on R2 and
R3 aggregation. Detailed ESI-MS and NMR experiments demonstrate the
interaction of Cu2+ with MT binding repeats. We show that
redox activity of copper increases when bound to the MT repeats leading
to ROS formation, which significantly contribute to cellular damage
and neuron death. Results presented here provide new insights into
the molecular mechanism of tau aggregation and ROS formation and suggest
a new target domain for tau aggregation inhibitors.

Introduction
Pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) like other neurodegenerative
diseases involves abnormal protein aggregation in the central nervous
system. While aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) leads to the
formation of extracellular amyloid plaques, aggregation of tau protein
results in the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles
(NFTs).1−4 Protein aggregation is a multistep process, which starts with abnormal
protein conformational changes and continues by dimerization or oligomerization
with subsequent formation of amyloid plaques or NFTs.5−7 Experimental evidence suggests that not only amyloid plaques and
NFTs are involved in neuronal death, but small toxic aggregates more
likely contribute to the cell toxicity.6−8 A number of factors can
give rise to protein aggregation, including environmental stress and
ageing.3,6,7 Previous reports
also showed that metals such as zinc, iron, and copper, which are
essential for normal brain function, are unusually accumulated in
the brain of AD patients.9−11 Even though the concentrations
of free metal ions are tightly controlled, metal dyshomeostasis under
pathological conditions may lead to the enhancement of free metal
ions in neurons.9,11 In particular, copper, which
is involved in many enzymatic activities in the brain, not only presents
as a tightly bound cofactor but labile and mobile copper ions are
also involved in neural activity.12,13 Both mono-
and divalent are essential for copper cofactor activity, in which
reactive oxygen species (ROS) is generated through transition between
two oxidation states of copper.14,15 In a healthy condition,
the Cu+/2+ distribution is highly regulated by an efficient
homeostatic mechanism in the brain, in addition to detoxification
of ROS. In addition, while the predominant oxidation state in a healthy
condition would presumably be Cu+ within neurons, dyshomeostasis
and ROS formation may contribute to a considerable level of Cu2+.12,14−16 Also, this
might certainly be of relevance in the later stages of the disease.

A study by Squitti et al. showed that the copper content of cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) in AD patients is higher than that for a healthy control,
which may be related to the lability of serum copper that can be passed
through the blood-brain barrier.17 An increase
in the level of peroxides and tau protein in CSF, which is confirmed
by this study, may suggest a neurotoxic effect of copper.17 In animal experiments, the neurotoxicity of
copper was demonstrated by the addition of a trace amount of Cu2+ to the drinking water, which enhanced the animal’s
memory loss.18,19 While there are a number of studies
reporting the interaction of Cu2+ with tau and some of
its fragment peptides,20−25 the role of Cu2+ on tau aggregation is not well understood.
Previous studies suggested that two hexapeptide motifs within R2 (275VQIINK280) and R3 (306VQIVYK311) are involved in the formation of paired helical filaments (PHFs).26−29 More detailed cryo-electron microscopy studies by Fitzpatrick et
al. and by Falcon et al. of PHFs demonstrate the presence of different
tau isoforms within.30,31 The presence of cysteine (Cys)
in R2 and R3 (Scheme 1) is another feature that may contribute to aggregation by the formation
of a disulfide bond. Experiments reported by others on tau peptide
constructs which possess a Cys residue demonstrated the disulfide
bond formation.32,33 Furthermore, the potential for
ROS generation due to the redox reaction of Cu2+ with Cys
of tau protein has not been well studied. In this report, we provide
unequivocal evidence of the interaction of Cu2+ with full-length
microtubule (MT) binding repeats R1 (tau244-274), R2 (tau275-305),
R3 (tau306-336), and R4 (tau337-368), which lead to the peptide aggregation
and solid evidence for fibril formation and ROS generation for R2
and R3.

and MT Binding Domain; (B) Amino Acid Sequence of MT Binding Repeats
(R1, R2, R3, and R4)
Tau, an MT-associated protein with six isoforms (Scheme S1), which is mainly expressed in neurons,
is an intrinsically
disordered protein, highly water-soluble and with low tendency to
aggregate under normal physiological conditions.1,4 Tau
proteins are attached to the MTs through an MT- binding domain consisting
of three or four MT binding repeats R1–R4 (Scheme S1).1,4,34 The
MT binding repeats not only play a critical role in MT assembly but
also play a key role in the aggregation of the tau protein.1,34 The formation of the disulfide bond due to the presence of cysteine
in R2 and R3 may further implicate to the protein aggregation.32,33 Because MT binding repeats are of such importance, we hypothesized
that these motifs also play an essential role in copper-tau interaction,
which may lead to the tau aggregation and ROS formation. Previous
studies involving short 18-mer peptides of R1, R2, and R3 demonstrated
that these peptides indeed interact with Cu2+, giving rise
to conformational changes.20−22 Earlier works from our group
reported on the interactions of Cu2+, Zn2+,
and Fe2/3+ with surface-bound htau39 (2N3R) (Scheme S1) using electrochemical techniques.24,35 We demonstrated that conformational changes occur as a result of
the interaction of htau39 with Fe2/3+.35 Our recent studies showed that the interaction of Fe2/3+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ with full-length
htau40 leads to the protein aggregation. Furthermore, in the case
of redox-active metal ions, these interactions promote ROS formation.36 However, there is still a lack of information
about the interaction of Cu2+ with the full-length MT binding
repeats R1, R2, R3, and R4, the ability of these peptides to aggregate
in the presence of Cu2+, and detailed studies of ROS formation.

In the present study, we explore the interaction of all four MT
binding repeats R1–R4 of tau (htau40) with Cu2+ (Scheme 1B) by focusing on
the chemistry aspect of these interactions. Given the possibility
of redox activity of cysteine, we report on significant differences
in chemical behavior, as well as in ROS formation and aggregation
profile between R1–R4 and the cysteine-containing MT repeats
R2/R3. In addition, while our current studies provide information
about metal coordination to peptide fragments R1–R4, their
reactivity with regard to ROS formation, and peptide aggregation,
there are inherent limitations when working with the peptide fragment,
as such studies may provide results that differ from those involving
the entire protein.

Results and Discussion
Interactions of Cu2+ with MT Binding Repeats Mediate
the Dimerization in R2 and R3
Complexation of Cu2+ with all four MT binding repeats was confirmed by ESI-MS experiments
(Figure 1); while for
R1 and R4, metalation was observed leading to the formation of M +
Cu and M + 2Cu adducts, for R2 and R3, ESI-MS results showed the presence
of peptide dimers. The ESI-MS spectrum (Figures 1A and S1) depicts
the mono- and dimetalation of R1, leading to the formation of multiple
charged ions (+2, +3 and +4). Nevertheless, peaks of native R1 is
predominant, and peaks related to the R1–Cu complex have appreciable
intensities. Comparing intensities of R1–Cu complex peaks to
those related to R1–2Cu suggests a two-step reaction (Scheme S2). The interaction of R4 with Cu2+ also results in the formation of R4–Cu and R4–2Cu
complexes (Figures 1D and S4). Remarkably, the interactions
of the Cys-containing repeats R2 and R3 with Cu2+ show
a more complex chemistry and dimerization, which is one of the key
features of this interaction, as confirmed by multiple charged 2M
and 2M–Cu ions (+4, +5, +6, and +7) (Figures 1B,C, S2, and S3). Interestingly, there is no evidence for the formation of the M–Cu
complex for R2 and R3 as previously reported for shorter R2/R3 tau
peptides.21,22 Instead, metal complexes identified are
only related to R2 and R3 dimers. It should be mentioned that dimerization
was not reported for the 18-mer R2 and R3 before.21,22 The ESI-MS spectrum shows signals identified as the dimer of R2
at m/z of 934.50, 1089.75, 1307.07,
and 1634.61 with charges of 7, 6, 5, and 4, respectively. Similarly,
signals related to the dimerization of R3 are identified at m/z of 929.64, 1084.27, 1300.92, and 1625.88
with charges of 7, 6, 5, and 4, respectively. The dimerization is
the result of the reactivity of R2 and R3 with Cu2+ as
is confirmed by gel electrophoresis of R1–R4 in the presence
of Cu2+ (Figure 2A).

R3, and (D) R4 after incubating in 140 μM Cu2+ solution
(2:1 molar ratio of Cu/R) at 25 °C (pH 7.4) for 24 h. The ESI-MS
results confirm the metalation of MT binding repeats. While mono-
and dimetalation of R1 and R4 are observed, dimerization occurs upon
interaction of Cu2+ with Cys-containing MT binding repeats
R2 and R3. Metalation of R2 and R3 dimers are also confirmed by the
ESI-MS spectrum.

Interactions of Cu2+ with R2/R3 lead to the ROS formation
as a consequence of disulfide bond formation. (E) Schematic representation
of the proposed catalytic role of Cu2+ in the dimerization
and ROS formation.

As can be seen from Figure 2A, dimerization is
observed for R2 and R3 (traces 9 and 10)
in the presence of Cu2+ and is absent for R1 and R4 (traces
3 and 4). Some dimerization of peptides R2 and R3 occurs even in the
absence of Cu2+ as indicated in Figure 2A (traces 5 and 6). However, in the presence
of Cu2+, all of R2 and R3 is converted to the corresponding
dimer and no monomer was observed (Figure 2A, traces 9 and 10). It can be assumed that
the thiol groups of cysteine residues present in R2 (Cys291) and R3
(Cys322) are involved in the oxidation to the respective disulfide
bonds as indicated in Scheme S3A. Dimers
disappeared (traces 11 and 12) after treatment with the dithiothreitol
(DTT, as a reducing agent), which confirms the formation of dimers
through the disulfide bond. Inter- and intramolecular disulfide bond
formation due to redox activity of Cu2+ is a well-defined
process; however, this is the first time that is reported for the
MT binding repeats of tau protein, which leads to the dimerization.
The disulfide bond in tau fragments can also be triggered by H2O2 as was shown by Walker et al.37 In order to evaluate the impact of Cu2+, we
performed gel electrophoresis after incubating R2/R3 with H2O2 under the same condition as for Cu2+ (Figure 2B traces 4 and 7).
The results show that the dimerization for R2/R3 in the presence of
Cu2+ is more significant compared to H2O2, which suggest that Cu2+ complexation may play
an important role in the disulfide bond formation (Figure 2B). We also examined the dimerization
of R2/R3 in a reducing environment by performing gel electrophoresis
for the solution of R2/R3 after incubating in a solution of Cu2+ and 10 mM ascorbic acid (AA) (1:20:2 molar ratio of R/AA/Cu2+) to provide a reducing environment (Figure 2B, traces 3 and 6). Gel electrophoresis results
confirm that the interaction of copper with R2/R3 in a reducing environment
also leads to the R2/R3 dimerization.

We also performed a competitive
study to evaluate the ability of
ascorbate to reduce Cu2+ in the presence of MT binding
repeats. Figure 2C
shows the reduction of AA absorbance (262 nm) in the solution of MT
binding repeats R1–R4 in the presence of Cu2+ (1:20:2
molar ratio of R/AA/Cu2+). The time-dependent experiments
show (Figures 2C and S5) that AA in the solution of R1 and R4 reduced
as fast as the control sample without peptides, while the AA reduction
in the solution of R2 and R3 took 40 and 100 min, respectively. These
results indicate that R2 and R3 have more affinity to react with Cu2+ than AA, which suggests that AA cannot combat the Cu2+ reactivity even at very high concentration and explain the
R2 and R3 dimerization in the presence of AA (Figure 2B). This observation more emphasizes the
differences between Cys-containing MT repeats R2/R3 and R1–R4.

The redox process between Cu2+ and Cys results in the
formation of a disulfide bond, while Cu+ is formed in the
process (Scheme S3A). Presumably, Cu+ has the potential to be involved in reactions that lead to
the formation of ROS.38−40 Ząbek-Adamska et al. claimed that the Cu(II)–His2 complex in the presence of cysteine produce ROS.41 They proposed a cyclic mechanism in which the
Cu(II)–His2 complex binds to the Cys and while Cys
oxidizes, Cu(I)–His2 is formed. The Cu(I)–His2 is able to be involved in Fenton reaction and producing ROS,
in which Cu(II)–His2 is generated again that is
capable of oxidizing Cys.41 Our observation
reinforces the proposed mechanism because even low concentration of
Cu2+ causes R2/R3 dimerization as the same extent that
occurs in the presence of excess Cu2+. Figure 2E illustrates a proposed catalytic
role of Cu2+ in the dimerization, which may lead to the
ROS formation.

ROS Formation upon Cu2+ Interactions
Oxidative
damage is one of the key events in ageing that has been implicated
in many diseases including AD, which is because of misregulation of
ROS. In order to probe the formation of ROS upon interaction of Cu2+ with MT binding repeats, we examined changes of the fluorescence
intensity of 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF, as a fluorescence ROS probe)
at 523 nm.42,43Figure 2D (Figure S6B,C) shows an increase in the fluorescence intensity when Cu2+ is added to solutions of R2 and R3 which reach a plateau after 100
min, while solutions of R1 and R4 in the presence of Cu2+ and DCF do not exhibit any appreciable increase of the fluorescence
intensity (Figures 2D and S6A,D). The fluorescence intensity
corresponds to the amount of ROS that is released because of the redox
activity of the R–Cu complex. The fluorescence intensity of
R2–Cu and R3–Cu was higher compared to the R1–R4
complexes, allowing us to conclude that ROS formation is a consequence
of disulfide bond formation, for which Cu+ is generated
(Figures 2D and S6B,C).

Gaubert et al. showed that histidine
decreases the redox potential of Cu2+/Cu+, which
enhances the Fenton reaction.44 We performed
a surfaced-based electrochemical experiment to investigate the redox
activity of R–Cu complexes. Our results show a decrease in
the redox potential of Cu2+/Cu+, which are in
line with Gaubert’s results (Figures S7–S9 and Table S1). Based on these results,
and because of the affinity of histidine to copper, we hypothesized
that histidine is the putative binding site of Cu2+.

Coordination Chemistry of R–Cu Complex
Next,
detailed studies of the interaction of Cu2+ with R1–R4
by a series of NMR experiments were performed. Although there is an
explicit difference between the interaction of R1–R4 and R2/R3
with Cu2+, similarities in the amino acid sequence of these
peptides suggest that they may have the same copper coordination as
reported for the 18-mer R peptides.20−22,45 We examined the hypothesis that the histidine residue is the potential
binding site for the Cu2+ by assuming that Cu2+ remains paramagnetic in the peptide complex. Cu2+ coordination
to the imidazole of His will result in paramagnetic contact shifts
and will give rise to significant line broadening in the NMR spectra.46,47 Given the paramagnetic nature of Cu2+, coordination to
the imidazole ring is expected to result in line broadening of the
imidazole H, which is because of the interaction with the unpaired
spin of d9 Cu2+, causing changes in the relaxation
time. Figure 3A shows
the 1H NMR spectrum of R4, which depicts two sharp signals
that are assigned to the protons Ha and Hb at
7.19 and 8.50 ppm. The assignments of the amino acid residues are
based on previous reports.20−22,25,29 In the absence of Cu2+, the 1H NMR spectra of all 4 peptides consisted of 1H
resonances that span almost the entire 1H chemical shift
range (Figures 3A and S10–S13). Based on their relatively narrow
line shape, these peptides are likely undergoing isotropic motions
that average out various undesirable line broadening interactions.
As can be expected, the response to the addition of Cu2+ differs between the different MT binding repeats. This can be due
to several factors, including peptide aggregation and paramagnetic
relaxation. As shown in Figures S10 and S13, in the absence of the cysteine residue, the interaction of Cu2+ with R1 or R4 mainly occurred at the imidazole group of
His. Furthermore, the relaxometry data (Figures S14 and S17) of R1 and R4 further support the results of the
1D 1H NMR. In both peptides, the most prominent changes
in both T1 and T2 occur in the aromatic region,
while both T1 and T2 of the aliphatic region
remain relatively similar regardless of the R/Cu2+ molar
ratio. In the case of R2 and R3, an interaction still appears to take
place at His as indicated by the broadening of this residue in both
cases; however, the cysteine has a significant impact in the Cu2+ interaction (Figures S11 and S12). As concluded from the ESI-MS and gel electrophoresis results and
based on the literature,23,48,49 the thiol group in cysteine is prone to form a disulfide bond through
the oxidative folding when an oxidizing agent like Cu2+ is introduced. As shown in Figures S11 and S12, the gradual disappearance of cysteine H2 and H3 peaks was found
in both R2 and R3 after adding the Cu2+ solution, while
a rather broad cysteine H3 (consistent with the disulfide unit) peak
slowly appeared in their spectra. The corresponding NMR relaxometry
(Figures S15 and S16) also shows a large
reduction in both T1 and T2 values for R2 and
R3 across the entire 1H chemical shift range, compared
to their noncysteine-containing counterparts (R1 and R4), in which
only aromatic residues are predominantly affected by Cu2+. The change in relaxation of essentially all protons in R2 and R3
indicates a drastic change in the overall protein rigidity and suggests
that the peptides are undergoing aggregation (Figures S15 and S16). These observations further support the
notion that the disulfide bond is formed by Cu2+ in R2
and R3.

of R4 (2 mM of R4 at 25 °C at pH 7.4). Addition of Cu2+ to a solution of R4 and effects on the line broadening of the imidazole
H. Note the line broadening of the Ha and Hb of the imidazole ring at 8.52 and 7.19 ppm, respectively, as a result
of Cu2+ addition, clearly indicating the interaction of
the His imidazole with the Cu2+ ion, as indicated in the
schematic representation. (B) X-band EPR spectra of frozen solution

spectrum using EPRNMR software (blue). Cu2+ in phosphate
buffer at pH 7.4 is provided as a control (green) (see the Supporting Information for the details). The
results confirm that all R–Cu complexes have the same coordination;
the coordination to the imidazole ring of His has been also confirmed
by NMR. (C) Proposed scheme for the coordination environment of R–Cu
complexes based on the EPR and NMR results.

In order to assess the copper coordination in the R–Cu
complex,
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies were carried out. Given
the presence of a single unpaired electron in Cu2+, EPR
is a useful tool that provides information about the specific coordination
environment. Figure 3B shows the EPR spectrum of the MT binding repeats R4 after incubating
in Cu2+ solution for 24 h (see Figure S18 for the EPR spectrum of other R–Cu complexes). Our
experiment showed, as reported before,45 that the EPR signal for Cu2+ solution in phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) is negligible and does not interfere with the signal of the
R–Cu complex (Figure 3B, green line). Simulation of the EPR spectrum gave a reasonable
fit of the experimental data with the axial Cu2+ center
(Figure 3B, blue line).
This result indicates that the copper coordination environment is
the same for all MT binding repeats, which means that copper complexation
is an independent reaction from the dimerization for R2 and R3. This
observation also rejects the hypothesis of the formation of the copper
bridge in R2 and R3 dimers (Scheme S3B)
and further supports the formation of disulfide bond during the dimerization
(Scheme S3A). The simulation gave the value
of g∥ = 2.361 and g⊥ = 2.077, and hyperfine splitting A∥ = 165 G and A⊥ equal to 9 G. Based on the Peisach–Blumberg classification,50−53 the Cu2+ is located within a type 2 coordination geometry.
Potential ligating sites include the His imidazole N, backbone amides
N or O as well as other oxygen-based ligating sites, including potential
influence of solvation. A number of Cu-peptides have been structurally
characterized allowing a detailed analysis of the Cu-coordination
environment.51−54 The EPR results further support the coordination of the imidazole
ring of His to Cu2+, as indicated in Figure 3C. The involvement of the peptide backbone
in coordination to Cu2+ is well known and a number of structurally
well-characterized examples have been reported in the literature.38,55−58 Others noted that the coordination environment in some Cu-peptide
complexes is influenced by dynamic solvation.59 For the shorter 18-mer peptides, Shin and Saxena45 also suggested the His residue as a putative binding site
for the pseudo-repeats. However, specific coordination environments
may vary significantly as Sakaguchi and Addison60 showed that the g∥/A∥ values can be used to evaluate the
tetrahedral distortion. Lower A∥ and higher g∥ compared to what
was reported for pseudo-repeats45 suggests
a tetrahedral distortion of square planar geometry.60

Influence of Cu2+ on the Aggregation
of MT Binding
Repeats
Importantly, there are significant differences in
the ability of R1–R4 to aggregate in the presence of Cu2+. Results presented here show that disulfide bond formation
for R2 and R3 results in the formation of dimers (Figures 1 and 2A,B). Peptide dimerization is the early stage of the aggregation.
ESI-IMS-MS results allow us to evaluate structural changes as a result
of the interaction of R1–R4 with Cu2+. The DriftScope
plot (Figure S19) shows the distribution
of species based on their m/z and drift time, which is determined
by the collisional cross section (CCS) of the species. Comparing the
drift time of R1 with that of the R1–Cu complex (Figures S20 and S21) indicates that these two
molecules have a different CCS, which suggests that the R1–Cu
complex is more folded. For R4 and its Cu complex, the difference
in drift time is significantly less, suggesting that Cu2+ has less impact on the conformational changes of R4 (Figures S28 and S29) compared to R1.

Circular
dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Figure S30) showed that all four MT binding repeats mainly have a random coil
structure, which remains unchanged after 24 h at room temperature.
However, the enhancement of the CD signal at 226.7 nm is pointed to
the increasing of the α-helix structure in R1 and the negative
peak at 294.5 nm indicates the formation of a tertiary structure after
incubation of Cu2+ for 24 h (Figure S30A). The changes in the CD spectrum of R4 after incubation
in Cu2+ solution showed a similar trend as R1, but they
were less significant (Figure S30D). These
observations indicate that the metalation of R1 and R4 leads to conformational
and structural changes, which is the first stage of peptide aggregation.
The aggregation of MT binding repeats upon Cu2+ interaction
was also determined by their diffusion coefficients measured using
diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) NMR spectroscopy. The diffusion
data analysis is shown in Figure 4. While no significant changes are observed in the
diffusion for R1 and R4 (Figure 4A,D) in the presence of Cu2+ (1:1 molar),
a considerable decrease in diffusion was detected after the interaction
of Cu2+ with R2 and R3 (Figure 4B,C). We interpret these differences to be
a direct consequence of the aggregation under the reaction conditions.

(A) R1, (B) R2, (C) R3, and (D) R4 before (black fitting curve) and
after incubating in 2 mM Cu2+ (red fitting curve) solution
at 25 °C (pH 7.4). The diffusion coefficient did not show significant
changes for R1 (D = 1.70 × 10–10 m2/s) and R1–Cu (D = 1.73 ×
10–10 m2/s). The same results were obtained
for R4 (D = 1.65 × 10–10 m2/s) and R4–Cu (D = 1.69 × 10–10 m2/s). However, there was considerable
decrease in the diffusion coefficient when Cu2+ is added
to R2 (DR2 = 1.82 × 10–10 m2/s, DR2–Cu = 1.43
× 10–10 m2/s) and R3 (DR3 = 1.74 × 10–10 m2/s, DR3–Cu = 1.20 × 10–10 m2/s), which indicates that Cu2+ triggers the aggregation in R2 and R3.

Our study provides solid evidence that aggregation of the
MT binding
repeats occurs in the presence of Cu2+ ions. We further
investigated this influence by studying the morphology of MT binding
repeats in the presence and absence of Cu2+ ions after
3 and 4 days utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Based
on the ESI-MS results, which show the dimerization of R2 and R3 upon
copper interactions, we expected a significant difference between
R1–R4 and R2/R3 in the structure of the aggregates. TEM images
of R1–R4 in the absence of Cu2+ serve as controls
and do not show major aggregation (Figures S31 and S32). Incubation of all four MT binding repeats in Cu2+ solution led to peptide aggregation after 3 days (Figures S33 and S34). Figure 5 shows a set of representative TEM images
of peptides R1–R4 after 4 days of incubation. The R1 showed
oligomeric aggregates after 3 days (Figure S33), with the subsequent formation of larger amorphous aggregates (with
a maximum size 0.5 × 0.9 μm) after 4 days of incubation
in Cu2+ solution at room temperature (Figure 5). The R4 also formed oligomeric
aggregates in 3 days (Figure S34) and amorphous
aggregates after 4 days incubation in Cu2+ solution (Figure 5, with a maximum
size 0.5 × 0.9 μm). Interestingly, the TEM images indicate
that Cu2+ mediates the formation of fibrils of R2 and R3.
The R2 fibrils started to form together with amorphous aggregates
after 3 days incubating in Cu2+ solution (Figure S33). The number of fibrils increased dramatically
after 4 days (Figure 5, with a maximum length of 1 μm and thickness of 0.02 μm).
The Cu2+ ions also triggered the aggregation in R3, which
led to the formation of amorphous aggregates in 3 days (Figure S34) and protofibrils after 4 days of
incubation (Figure 5, with a maximum length of 0.5 μm and thickness of 0.02 μm).
While the interaction of Cu2+ with R3 produces more ROS,
the interaction of Cu2+ with R2 leads to more pronounced
aggregation.

Figure 5 Negative-stain TEM images confirm the influence of Cu2+ on the aggregation of MT binding repeats R1–R4. Representative
TEM images of R1–R4 after incubation at 25 °C (pH 7.4)
for 4 days in (A) Cu2+ solution (molar ratio of 2:1 for
Cu/R), (B) in AA and Cu2+ solution (molar ratio of 20:2:1
for AA/Cu/R), and (C) H2O2 solution (molar ratio
of 2:1 for H2O2/R). (See the Supporting Information for the details) TEM images illustrate
the different aggregation profiles of MT binding repeats in oxidative
and reducing environments and the presence of amorphous aggregates
for R1 and R4 after 4 days incubation in Cu2+ solution
and formation of fibrils and protofibrils for R2 and R3, respectively,
show the impact of Cu2+ on R1–R4 aggregation. The
observation of amorphous aggregates and oligomers in a reducing environment
in the presence of Cu2+ reinforces the catalytic role of
Cu2+ in R1–R4 aggregation.

These experiments confirmed that the peptide aggregation
is a consequence
of conformational changes and misfolding, which was observed after
24 h incubation of MT binding repeats in Cu2+ solution.
It also depicted that the dimers can be the seeds for fibril formation.
The dramatic differences between peptide with cysteine residues and
those without cysteine emphasized the role of cysteine residues in
peptide aggregation in the presence of a redox-active metals such
as Cu2+.

The R2/R3 aggregation after incubating in
Cu2+ (molar
ratio 2:1 of Cu/R) for 4 days were also evaluated by dynamic light
scattering (DLS). A large polydispersity index of 0.76 for R2 suggested
that the sample contains large aggregates, which is in agreement with
the TEM image that shows the formation of the fibrils. The size distribution
plot (Figure S35) shows the presence of
three species with the size of 2.5 ± 0.1, 342 ± 32, and
4518 ± 233 nm. The DLS results confirm that the sample mainly
contains dimers and remaining are oligomers or fibrils with the molecular
weight of 5.7 ± 1.2 × 105 and 2.4 ± 0.3
× 108 (Table S2). The size
distribution plot for R3 (Figure S36) also
shows the presence of three species with the size of 3.2 ± 0.1,
220 ± 55, and 1003 ± 662. The R3 sample mainly contains
trimers and remaining oligomers with the molecular weight of 2.2 ±
0.8 × 107 and 8.8 ± 3.2 × 106 (Table S3).

In order to evaluate
the formation of the β-sheet upon Cu2+ addition,
we performed thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence experiments.
ThT is a common fluorescence probe for monitoring the β-sheet
structure.61−63 It has been shown that the tau protein can adopt
a β-sheet structure in the presence of heparin, which was monitored
by ThT fluorescence experiments.33,64 Ganguly et
al. studied the self-assembly of the tau fragment R2/wt (273-284)
and R3/wt (306-317) and reported the aggregation of R3/wt in the presence
of heparin. In addition, while R3/wt displayed a strong ThT fluorescence,
the corresponding experiments with R2/wt did not, suggesting potential
structural differences. The ThT fluorescence intensity is significantly
less for both peptides in the absence of heparin.64Figure S37 shows the results
of ThT fluorescence experiments for R1–R4 and after 4 days
incubation at room temperature in the presence and absence of Cu2+. The results do not allow us to draw any firm conclusion
with regard to the internal structure of the aggregates, and one may
only speculate that the aggregates exists mainly in the random coil
structure.

Our findings suggest the involvement of Cu2+ in various
steps of the aggregation pathway, which emphasizes the role of Cu2+ in AD pathology. We also compared the aggregation profile
of peptides R1–R4 in the presence of H2O2 as an oxidizing agent. As expected from gel electrophoresis results,
the aggregation is more severe in the presence of Cu2+ (Figure 5) compared to H2O2. The impact of Cu2+ on the aggregation
of MT binding repeats in a reducing environment was also evaluated
by incubation of R1–R4 and Cu2+ in the presence
of excess AA (1:20:2 molar ratio of R/AA/Cu2+) (Figure 5C). The TEM images
show aggregate formation in the presence of Cu2+ even under
reducing conditions (Figure 2E).

Impact of Glutathione on the Interaction
of Cu2+ with
MT Binding Repeats
Glutathione (GSH) is one of the most abundant
nonprotein thiol-containing antioxidants in the neurons, which plays
an important role in neutralizing free radicals and reduces the oxidative
stress.65−67 At a healthy brain concentration of GSH is 1–4
mM, which is reduced by age, and as some evidence showed, GSH may
be indirectly related to the AD.65−67 GSH can reduce Cu2+ to Cu+ with a similar mechanism of R2/R3 by the
formation of a disulfide bond, and evidence shows that generated Cu+ can bond to GSH.67−69 However, Speisky et al. showed
that the Cu(I)–[GSH]2 complex can reduce the molecular
oxygen to superoxide anions.68,69

Therefore, we
designed a series of experiments to evaluate the impact of GSH on
the interaction of Cu2+ with MT binding repeats. Because
GSH has a high affinity to react with the Cu2+, we incubated
MT binding repeats (R1–R4) in Cu2+ in the presence
of GSH (molar ratio of 1:2:1 for R/Cu/GSH) in limited access of oxygen
by purging the N2 in solutions. TEM images (Figures 6A and S38) show that even in the presence of 1 mM GSH, aggregation
of MT binding repeats happens, suggesting that Cu2+ may
have more affinity to interact with MT binding repeats or this interaction
is kinetically or thermodynamically more favorable.

Figure 6 Negative-stain TEM images
and gel electrophoresis confirm the influence
of Cu2+ on the aggregation of MT binding repeats R1–R4
in the presence of glutathione (GSH) and AA. Representative TEM images
of R1–R4 after incubation at 25 °C (pH 7.4) for 4 days
in (A) Cu2+ and GSH (molar ratio of 1:2:1 for R/Cu/GSH)
in limited access of oxygen, (B) Cu2+ and GSH (molar ratio
of 1:0.5:10 for R/Cu/GSH) in ambient oxygen and (C) Cu2+, AA, and GSH (molar ratio of 1:0.5:10:10 for R/Cu/GSH/AA) in ambient
oxygen (see the Supporting Information for
the details). TEM images illustrate the different aggregation profiles
of MT binding repeats in different reducing environments. Formation
of amorphous aggregates, oligomers, and protofibrils upon interaction
of Cu2+ with MT binding repeats in the presence of GSH
at various environments suggested that GSH not only does not inhibit
the interaction of Cu2+ with MT binding repeats but also
triggers the MT binding repeat aggregation in particular for R3. Gel
electrophoresis of (D) 1 mM R2 and (E) 1 mM R3 after incubation in
0.5 mM Cu2+ and (1) 20, (2) 10, (3) 5, (4) 1, (5) 0.5,
(6) 0.25 mM GSH, and (7) without GSH at limited access to oxygen.
(F) Quantification of gel electrophoresis results; plot of percentage
of dimers bonds for R2 (red) and R3 (blue) versus concentration of
GSH. The results show that Cu2+ triggers the R2/R3 dimerization
even in the millimolar concentration of GSH.

The aggregation of MT binding repeats was also evaluated
in ambient
oxygen at catalytical concentration of Cu2+ and high concentration
of GSH (molar ratio of 1:0.5:10 for R/Cu/GSH). The TEM images (Figures 6B and S39) confirm the impact of Cu2+ on
the MT binding repeat aggregation in the presence of 10 mM GSH. Interestingly,
more protofibrils in a noticeably larger size were formed for R3 in
the presence of higher concentration of GSH and lower concentration
of Cu2+, which may suggest a significant role of GSH in
R3 aggregation in the presence of Cu2+. These results reinforce
the formation of superoxide by Cu(I)–[GSH]2, which
is proposed by Speisky et al.68,69 In order to evaluate
the aggregation effect of Cu2+ in a strong reducing environment,
MT binding repeats were also incubated in Cu2+ in the presence
of 10 mM GSH and 10 mM AA (molar ratio of 1:0.5:10:10 for R/Cu/GSH/AA)
to provide a complex reducing environment.

The TEM images (Figures 6C and S40) show that AA/GSH can
reduce the aggregation but cannot completely inhibit the aggregation
effect of Cu2+. The inhibitor effect of GSH in preventing
the R2 and R3 dimerization, as the first step of aggregation, was
evaluated by gel electrophoresis (Figure 6D–F). The R2/R3 (1 mM) dimerization
upon the Cu2+ (0.5 mM) interaction was monitored in the
presence of GSH (0.25–20 mM) and in the limited access of oxygen.
The gel electrophoresis shows that at 1 mM concentration of GSH, more
than 70% of R2 and 60% of R3 were dimerized. Notably, by increasing
the concentration of GSH, a range of peptides with molecular weight
between R2/R3 monomers and dimers formed, which may suggest that GSH
can bond to the R2/R3 monomer in different molar ratios to form these
peptides. These peptides can be seeds for formation of protofibrils,
which were observed by TEM. These observations reinforce the key role
of Cu2+ in the MT binding repeats even in the presence
of natural defense of neurons.

Conclusions
In
the current study, new insight into the interactions of MT binding
repeats of the tau protein with Cu2+ is provided. One of
the finding concerns MT repeats R2 and R3, where it was demonstrated
that Cys-based oxidation leading to disulfide bond formation occurs
in the presence of Cu2+, with significant consequences
to the R2 and R3 fibrillization and ROS formation. Our results unequivocally
confirm (a) Cu2+ coordination to His268 of R1 and His363
of R4, (b) the dimerization of R2 and R3 via disulfide bond formation,
and (c) Cu2+ coordination to the R2/R3 dimers. We have
no evidence to suggest the formation of stable complexes involving
Cys-coordination as reported before for the shorter motif of R2.21 It is evident that Cu2+ is involved
in different stages of aggregation by triggering conformational changes
of MT binding repeats, the dimerization of R2 and R3, the formation
of amorphous aggregates for R1 and R4, and the fibrillization for
R2 and R3. These findings are significant within a biological context
as they not only are related to differences in the aggregation process
of MT binding repeats but also address the role of Cu2+ in producing small toxic aggregates that may contribute in neuron
death. Our findings also provide a solid evidence for the ROS formation
as a result of the redox chemistry exhibited by Cys291 and Cys322
in the presence of Cu2+. Cysteine oxidation in R2 and R3
to the corresponding disulfides occurs even in the presence of glutathione
and ascorbate, abundant antioxidants in the neurons. Unusual ROS formation
due to the catalytic role of R–Cu adds to the oxidative stress
and to cell damage. These experimental findings are significant as
they draw a connection between Cu dyshomeostasis under pathological
conditions and aggregation of tau and ROS formation inside the neurons
as well as CSF.

Our results further support the metal chelators
as potential therapeutic
agents for AD. In our opinion, preventing Cys-based redox chemistry
may be a valuable therapeutic target. Design of molecules with multifunctional
activity that not only inhibit tau aggregation by targeting the Cys
regions but also chelate the copper to prevent the Cys-based redox
chemistry and ROS formation can be more efficient.

Experimental
Section
All chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade
and obtained
from Sigma Aldrich. Lipoic acid N-hydroxy succinimide
ester (Lip–NHS) was synthesized as reported before.70 Tau Peptide (244-274) (Repeat 1 domain, R1),
Tau Peptide (275-305) (Repeat 2 domain, R2), Tau Peptide (306-336)
(Repeat 3 domain, R3), and Tau Peptide (337-368) (Repeat 4 domain,
R4) were purchased from Anaspec (Fremont, CA, USA). The masses and
the purity of the peptides were confirmed by ESI-MS and HPLC (≥95%),
respectively. See Scheme 1 for the amino acid sequence of R1–R4. All the chemicals
used for gel electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories
(Canada) Ltd. Millipore-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm) was used for sample
preparation, and all the experiments were performed at room temperature
and pH 7.4 unless otherwise mentioned. A 10 mM CuCl2 stock
solution was prepared in Millipore-Q water right before each experiment
and diluted in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 to the desired concentration.
The peptide stock solutions were prepared by dissolving 1 mg of each
peptide in Millipore-Q water to get a final concentration of 3 mM.
The stock solutions were aliquoted and kept at −20 °C.
The CuCl2 solution was added to the peptide with the molar
ratio 2:1 of Cu2+/R to shift the equilibrium to the formation
of the copper complex unless otherwise mentioned. All the samples
were kept at room temperature for 24 h before the experiment unless
otherwise mentioned. The details of each experiment are provided in
the Supporting Information.
