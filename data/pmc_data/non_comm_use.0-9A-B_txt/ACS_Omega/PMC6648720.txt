Raman spectroscopy
fingerprinting features many technological applications.
For this purpose, the weak Raman signals need to be boosted dramatically
by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which provides immense
Raman enhancement via plasmonic and chemical mechanisms (CM). In this
manuscript, we reveal the giant chemical as well as extremely high
SERS enhancement from a three-dimensional MoS2–xOx–gold nanoparticle
(GNP) hybrid, which has capability for ultrasensitive label-free sensing
of chemical and biological molecules. Notably, reported data show
that the chemical enhancement for the MoS2–xOx surface is ∼105, which is comparable with the plasmonic enhancement factor (EF)
by GNP. Reported data show that the total Raman EF is ∼1013 from the GNP–MoS2–xOx hybrid. Intriguingly, combined experimental
and theoretical finite difference time domain stimulation modeling
findings show that the synergistic effect of electromagnetic mechanism
and CM is responsible for huge SERS enhancement. Experimental results
demonstrate that a proposed hybrid SERS platform can be used for fingerprint
sensing of different multiple drug resistance bacteria at 5 cfu/mL
concentration. Importantly, the current manuscript provides a good
strategy for manipulating the SERS sensitivity to 13 orders of magnitude,
which is instrumental for next-generation technological applications
of Raman spectroscopy.

1 Introduction
Raman
spectroscopy is highly promising for fingerprint identification
of chemical and biological molecules.1,2 Because of
the above unique ability and multiplex detection capability, the Raman
technique is highly valuable in forensics, homeland security, and
medical diagnosis industry.3,4 However, because of
the inherently low cross section of Raman scattering, it has not been
used as an analytical tool for practical applications.5,6 In last few decades, it has been reported that extremely weak Raman
signals can be dramatically enhanced by surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS) via plasmonic and chemical boosting mechanisms.7,8 In SERS, plasmonic enhancement occurs in the presence of plasmonic
nanoparticles via electromagnetic mechanism (EM).9,10 On
the other hand, chemical enhancement occurs via chemical mechanism
(CM), which originated from the charge transfer between the Raman
active molecule and the SERS substrate.11,12 In the last
2 decades, we and other groups have reported different types of SERS
materials which are based on the noble plasmonic metal nanoparticle,
where Raman intensity can be enhanced several orders of magnitude
(106 or higher) via EM.13,14 On the other
hand, for most of the reported SERS substrate, the reported chemical
enhancement factor (EF) is ∼102.15,16 Recently, the SERS substrate based on two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal
dichalcogenides has been reported,17−25 where the chemical EF can be much higher than 102, and
in this case, the laser excitation can be resonant to charge transfer
and exciton transitions in an analyte 2D system.26−32 For real-life applications, an SERS probe should possess strong
electromagnetic as well as strong chemical enhancement capability
for providing excellent sensitivity. Herein, we report huge chemical
(CM) and electromagnetic (EM) enhancements from a three-dimensional
(3D) MoS2–xOx–gold nanoparticle (GNP) hybrid. Experimental data reported
here indicate that the chemical EF is ∼105 from
the MoS2–xOx surface, which is comparable with the plasmonic enhancement
by GNP. Reported data demonstrated that oxygen incorporation on MoS2 can effectively improve the SERS performance via a strong
chemical enhancement mechanism. On the other hand, the total SERS
enhancement from the GNP–MoS2–xOx hybrid was observed to be ∼1013. Our experimental and theoretical finite difference time
domain (FDTD) stimulation modeling22,23 shows that
the synergistic effect of EM and CM is responsible for huge SERS enhancement.
To demonstrate that MoS2–xOx–GNP-based ultrasensitive SERS is
versatile for fingerprinting biological analysis, we have shown that
an SERS platform can be used for fingerprint sensing of different
multiple drug resistance bacteria such as carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli, drug-resistant Shigella, and Campylobacter, at 5 cfu/mL concentration.

2 Results and Discussion
As shown in Figure 1, we used a three-step method
for the synthesis of a 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid.
In the first step, a facile hydrothermal synthetic method was used
for the synthesis of MoS2 nanosheets. Experimental details
have been reported in the Experimental Section. In brief, in the first step, molybdenum(VI) oxide powder, sodium
sulfide (Na2S), and HCl were mixed and kept into a Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave. After that, the mixture was heated for
200 °C overnight. A black precipitate was obtained by centrifugation
from the final reaction products and then the 2D MoS2 was
washed with distilled water and ethanol. Because it is now well-known
that oxygen incorporation is the effective way to improve the SERS
performance of nonmetal oxide semiconductors,20−22 in the next
step, we have synthesized a 2D MoS2–xOx nanosheet. For this purpose,
we have developed a MoS2–xOx nanosheet, via annealing of 2D MoS2 at 350 °C temperature in air. In the third step, we have developed
a 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid. For this purpose, we have used GNP as a
linker between 2D MoS2–xOx nanosheets to form the 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid,
via a −Mo–S–Au– bond.

Figure 1 (A) Scheme shows the
synthetic route we have used to develop 2D
MoS2–xOx via a hydrothermal process as well as an annealing process. (B)
Scheme shows the synthetic route we have used to develop GNP–MoS2–xOx nanocomposites.

After that, we have used different
electron microscopic and spectroscopic
techniques6,11−16 to characterize the 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid as reported in Figures 2A–C and S1A–G. The elemental molar ratios of the
3D MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid were determined using energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman data. Figure S1A reports the transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image which indicates that the size of the GNP we
have synthesized is about 25 nm. Figure S1B reports the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which shows the morphology
of 2D MoS2–xOx nanosheets. Figure 2A reports the SEM image which shows the morphology of the
3D MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid, which indicates that a porous structure
is developed with a pore diameter varying from 10 to 400 nm. Both Figures 2A and S1C show the formation of a “hot spot”
by the GNP on the MoS2–xOx nanosheets. Figure S1E shows the EDX data from the MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid, which clearly shows
the presence of Mo, S, O, and Au. Similarly, Figure S1F shows the EDX data from MoS2, before annealing,
which clearly shows the presence of Mo and S.

morphology of MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid.
(B) Extinction spectra from MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid, GNP, and MoS2–xOx.
(C) Raman spectra from MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid and MoS2–GNP
hybrid.

Figure S1G shows the powder XRD data
from the MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid, which shows the presence of (002), (100),
(104), and (201) reflection for MoS2,20−23 (020) reflection for MoO3,16−19 and (111) and (3111) reflection for GNP. Figure 2B shows the absorption spectra for GNP, 2D
MoS2–xOx nanosheets, and 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid. Reported data clearly
indicate a broad plasmon band from the 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid
which is due to the aggregation of GNP on the 3D hybrid, as shown
in the TEM and SEM images reported in Figures S1C and 2A. To compare the Raman spectra
between the MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid and the MoS2–GNP
hybrid, we have also synthesized the MoS2–GNP hybrid.
For this purpose, we have used a GNP as a linker between 2D MoS2 nanosheets to form the MoS2––GNP
hybrid, via a −Mo–S–Au– bond. Experimental
details have been reported in the Supporting Information. The TEM image from the MoS2––GNP hybrid,
as reported in Figure S1D, clearly shows
the aggregation of GNP on the MoS2 surface. Figure 2C shows that the Raman spectra
from the 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid and MoS2–GNP
hybrid clearly indicate the presence of an in-plane (E2g) Raman band at ∼384 cm–1 and an out-of-plane
(A1g) Raman band at ∼409 cm–1,
which is due to Mo–S vibration of MoS2.20−23 We have observed a (E2g) Raman band and a (A1g) Raman band for MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid, as well as for MoS2–GNP hybrid. Similarly, as reported in Figure 2C, we have also observed Raman peaks at ∼820
and ∼996 cm–1, which are due to the Mo=O
vibration.19−22 Raman peaks at ∼820 and ∼996 cm–1 are only observed for the MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid, which has been
developed after annealing of MoS2, as we have discussed
previously.

Because Raman EF is most important for a Raman substrate,
we have
measured Raman EF using a 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) and Rh-6G dye.
For the Raman EF measurement, we have used a portable Raman probe,
where a continuous wavelength 670 nm diode-pumped solid-state laser
was used as the excitation source. We have used fiber optics probe
for excitation and data collection.6,11−16 Experimental details are reported in the Experimental
Section. Figure 3A shows strong Raman spectra from 4-ATP (10–6 M)
on MoS2–xOx surface. On the other hand, in the same condition, we have
not observed any Raman peak from 4-ATP (10–6 M),
when a bulk sample was used. Reported Raman data reported in Figure 3A show that dominated
vibrational peaks are due to the a1 vibrational mode peaks
and these are ν(CC + NH2 bend) at ∼1590 cm–1 and ν(CS) at ∼1078 cm–1.5−8 As reported in Figure 3A, we have also observed Raman peaks due to b2 modes,
at ∼1435 cm–1 due to the CC str in Ph ring
+ NH2 rock, and at ∼1170 cm–1 due
to CH bend vibration.10−13

profile of Rh-6G on MoS2, MoS2–xOx, GNP, GNP–MoS2–xOx surface, and without

varies with annealing temperature, as well as with the percentage
of oxygen incorporation. (D) Plot shows how the chemical EF and total
Raman EF factor vary with samples made in different batches.

As reported in Figure 3A, we have observed a clear
1078 cm–1 vibrational
band from ATP in the bulk and on all surfaces, and as a result, we
have used 1078 cm–1 vibrational band intensity for
Raman EF calculation. From the Raman spectra, we have measured the
Raman EF using the following equation.10−12 1  where IMoS2–xOx is the intensity
of 1078 cm–1 vibrational mode from 4-ATP on MoS2–xOx surface.
Similarly, Ibulk is the intensity of 1078
cm–1 vibrational band in the absence of MoS2–xOx surface. Mbulk is the number of 4-ATP used in the bulk
experiment without MoS2–xOx surface and Mads is the number of 4-ATP used for the Raman experiment on MoS2–xOx surface.
For bulk experiment, a Si/SiO2 wafer was used as the normal
Raman reference. For Raman experiment on all different surfaces, we
have assumed that the analytes were distributed uniformly on the surface.
The number of molecules is calculated using a laser spot size of 40
μm. From the experimental data on MoS2–xOx surface as reported in Figure 3A, we found out that
the EF is ∼1.3 × 105. Because of the lack of
surface plasmons in the visible light for MoS2–xOx surface, the observed
huge Raman enhancement on MoS2–xOx surface can be attributed to the chemical
enhancement mechanism.

The huge chemical enhancement on MoS2–xOx surface
is due to the photon-induced
charge transfer from the MoS2–xOx surface to the adsorbed 4-ATP molecule.
As reported in Figure S2C in the Supporting Information, the GNP-adsorbed 4-ATP molecule exhibits a new absorption peak
with λmax around 670 nm. We believe that the charge-transfer
resonance from the MoS2–xOx surface to the adsorbed 4-ATP molecule coupled
with exciton resonance as well as with molecular resonances, and as
a result, we have observed huge chemical enhancement.16−19 As we have discussed previously, a recent report indicates that
oxygen incorporation can effectively improve the SERS performance
of a semiconductor.22−25 To understand better, we have also performed Raman experiment on
the MoS2 surface. Reported experimental data in Figure 3A clearly indicate
that Raman EF is much higher on MoS2–xOx surface than that of MoS2 surface. From the experimental data, we found out that the
Raman EF for MoS2 surface is ∼2.3 × 102, whereas the EF is ∼1.3 × 105 for
MoS2–xOx. To understand how oxygen incorporation affects Raman intensity,
we have developed MoS2–xOx surface from MoS2 by annealing at different
temperatures, where the x value should be higher at higher temperature.
As reported in Figure 3C, experimental data show that the Raman EF increases as the annealing
temperature increases, which is due to the high amount of oxygen incorporation.
Reported data in Figure 3C also indicate that the Raman EF decreases above 400 °C, which
is mainly due to the phase change as we have noted from the XRD study.
We have measured the S and O ratio using EDX, XRD, and Raman data
and we found out that the oxygen percentage increases from 4% at 200
°C to 20% at 350 °C. As reported in Figure 3C, experimental data show that the Raman
EF increases with the high amount of oxygen incorporation. As reported
in Figure 3B, from
experimental data using Rh-6G as a bulk and on the surface, we have
found out that the Raman EF for MoS2 surface is ∼1.3
× 102 and the EF is ∼1.8 × 105 for MoS2–xOx, which is very similar to the observed data with 4-ATP. Figure 3A indicates that
the Raman EF on MoS2–xOx surface is comparable with the GNP surface. From
experimental data using 4-ATP, we have found out that the Raman EF
is ∼2.2 × 106 for GNP, which is around an order
of magnitude higher than the MoS2–xOx surface. As reported in Figure S2A
in the Supporting Information, the GNP-adsorbed
4-ATP molecule exhibits a new absorption peak with λmax around 670 nm, which is due to the GNP aggregation because of the
interaction between GNP and 4-ATP. Very interestingly, Raman data
reported in Figure 3A,B indicate that the Raman EF is ∼4.5 × 1013 for GNP–MoS2–xOx surface, which is around 8 orders of magnitudes
higher than the MoS2–xOx surface and 7 orders of magnitude higher than the
GNP surface. The observed extremely high Raman EF from GNP–MoS2–xOx surface
is due to the strong electromagnetic as well as strong chemical enhancement
capability, which provide excellent enhancement.

For our GNP–MoS2–xOx surface,
the GNP enhances the Raman signal
via EM, and on the other hand, MoS2–xOx enhances the Raman signal via
a chemical enhancement mechanism. As we have reported in this manuscript,
the Raman EF for only GNP is 2.2 × 106 and the same
for MoS2–xOx is ∼ 1.2 × 105., whereas the Raman
EF is ∼4.5 × 1013 for the GNP–MoS2–xOx surface.
We observed 2 orders of magnitude higher Raman EF for GNP. The MoS2–xOx surface
is mainly due to the formation of a “hot spot” by a
GNP in 3D interior and exterior surfaces, as shown in the SEM and
TEM images reported in Figures 2A and S1C. To find out the origin
of a synergistic enhancement mechanism, we have performed the 3D FDTD
simulation to understand the “hot spot”-based plasmon
coupling, which allows a huge EM enhancement mechanism.6,11−13,35,36 Calculation details are reported in the Experimental
Section and also reported previously by our group.6,11−16 As reported in Figure 4A, FDTD simulation data show that the field enhancement for GNP aggregates
in “hot spots” can be more than an order of magnitude
higher than that of the individual GNP.

Figure 4 (A) 3D FDTD simulated

nanoparticles. (B) SEM image shows that the drug-resistant Campylobacter bacteria are on the surface of 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP.
(C) Raman spectrum shows a huge signal from drug-resistant E. coli (3000 cfu/mL) on 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP, whereas
we have not observed any Raman signal from drug-resistant E. coli (3000 cfu/mL) in the absence of 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP
surface. (D) Plot shows Raman spectrum from drug resistant E. coli at different concentrations on 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP.
(E) Raman spectrum shows that 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP-based Raman can be
used as a fingerprint for different bacteria such as E. coli, Shigella, and Campylobacter.

Because Raman EF varies with the square of field
EF, we expect
to increase the Raman enhancement around 2–3 orders of magnitude
because of the “hot spot” formation. It is well documented
that the reproducibility and stability of Raman EF are very important
criteria for applications.1−5 For this purpose, we have developed a GNP–MoS2–xOx surface and only MoS2–xOx surface
in different batches and then monitored the reproducibility of the
Raman EF using 4-ATP. Figure 3D reports the reproducibility data for Raman EF and chemical
enhancement, which indicate very good reproducibility with a relative
standard deviation around 6.2%.

Next, to understand whether
our 3D GNP–MoS2–xOx can be used for trace-level
fingerprint sensing of multi-drug-resistant superbugs, we have used
carbapenem-resistant E. coli, drug-resistant Shigella, and Campylobacter. For this purpose, we have added different superbugs such as carbapenem-resistant E. coli, drug-resistant Shigella, and Campylobacter at different concentrations
(cfu/mL) to the GNP–MoS2–xOx surface. As shown in Figure 4B, drug-resistant Campylobacter bacteria are on the surface of 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP. Figure 4C,D shows strong
Raman peak from carbapenem-resistant E. coli even at 5 cfu/mL level. On the other hand, we have not observed
the Raman peak from carbapenem-resistant E. coli in the absence of GNP–MoS2–xOx surface, even at 3000 cfu/mL
level. Although we have observed huge Raman enhancement using GNP–MoS2–xOx surface,
as we have not observed any Raman peak from carbapenem-resistant E. coli in the absence of GNP–MoS2–xOx surface, as reported
in Figure 4C, we are
not able to determine the Raman EF using carbapenem-resistant E. coli. As reported in Figure 4D, in Raman spectra, we have observed in-plane
(E2g) Raman and out-of-plane (A1g) Raman bands
because of the MoS2–xOx surface. On the other hand, as reported in Table 1 and Figure 4D, we have observed amide I,
II, and III bands, phenyl alanine, tyrosine, collagen, phospholipid,
and glycosidic bands5−7,11,14−16,33,34 because of carbapenem-resistant E. coli. Raman spectra from carbapenem-resistant E. coli, drug-resistant Shigella, and Campylobacter, reported in Figure 4E and Table 1, clearly indicate that 3D GNP–MoS2–xOx can be used for fingerprint
Raman detection of different superbugs. As reported in Figure 4E, phospholipid and amide-III
bands are unique for carbapenem-resistant E. coli, which have not been observed for drug-resistant Shigella and Campylobacter. On the other hand, guanine, tyrosine, and adenine nucleic acid
bands are more prominent for Campylobacter, which we have not been observed for carbapenem-resistant E. coli and drug-resistant Shigella. Similarly, lipid bands near 1480 cm–1 are unique
for Shigella.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, our findings reveal that the 3D MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid
provides immense Raman enhancement via giant chemical enhancement
mechanisms, as well synergistic plasmonic enhancement mechanism. Reported
data show that because of the presence of MoS2–xOx in our hybrid, the
chemical EF is ∼105, which is comparable with plasmonic
EF by plasmonic nanoparticle. We have demonstrated that oxygen incorporation
on MoS2 can effectively improve the SERS performance via
a strong chemical enhancement mechanism, which is due to the photon-induced
charge transfer from the MoS2–xOx surface to the adsorbed molecule.
On the other hand, the total Raman EF is ∼1013 from
GNP–MoS2–xOx hybrid because of the synergistic effect of electromagnetic
and chemical enhancement mechanisms. The reported synergistic Raman
EF is mainly due to the “hot spot” formation by GNP
in 3D interior and exterior surfaces. Our experimental results show
that the GNP–MoS2–xOx hybrid has the capability for ultrasensitive
label-free sensing of carbapenem-resistant E. coli, drug-resistant Shigella, and Campylobacter, even at 5 cfu/mL concentration level.

4 Experimental Section
Molybdenum(VI) oxide powder, sodium
sulfide (Na2S) and
HCl, different solvents, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Superbugs such as carbapenem-resistant E. coli, drug-resistant Shigella, and Campylobacter and growth media
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville,
MD).

4.1 Synthesis of the Gold Nanoparticles
Spherical-shaped
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized according
to the previous work by our group.6,11−16 For this purpose, we have used 1.25 mL of 10 mM HAuCl4 solution and 2 mL of 1% trisodium citrate dihydrate. At the end,
the purified AuNPs were characterized by a microscopic technique,
as reported in Figure S1A.

4.2 Synthetic Procedure of MoS2 Nanosheets
A
facile hydrothermal synthetic method was adopted for the synthesis
of MoS2–xOx nanosheets. In a typical experiment, 0.72 g of molybdenum(VI)
oxide (MoO3) powder and 3.6 g of sodium sulfide (Na2S) were mixed gently and the mixture was transferred into
a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of capacity 100 mL. Then,
approximately 70 mL of 0.2 N HCl was added to fill the autoclave up
to 75–80% of the total volume. After that, the autoclave was
tightly sealed, maintained at 200 °C overnight, and then cooled
to room temperature. A black precipitate was obtained by centrifugation
from the final reaction products and washed successively with distilled
water and ethanol several times. Finally, the semisolid MoS2–xOx nanosheets were dried
in vacuum at 60 °C for 6 h. The pure products are characterized
by SEM and other spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, as reported
in Figure S1.

4.3 Synthesis
of the MoS2–GNP
Hybrid
To synthesize AuNP-decorated MoS2 nanosheets,
5.0 mL of 10 nM gold nanoparticle solution was dropped in 10 mL of
5 ppm of dispersed in freshly prepared MoS2 solutions in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer and the mixture was sonicated
for 2 h at room temperature. The mixture was continuously stirred
at very low speed overnight at room temperature for the completion
of the reaction. To remove excess regents and buffer solution, the
mixed solution was washed with methanol two to three times by centrifugation
at 5000 rpm for 15 min followed by decantation. Finally, the AuNP-decorated
MoS2 pellet was dried under vacuum at room temperature
for a week. Figure S1D shows the TEM image
of freshly prepared MoS2–GNP hybrid.

4.4 Synthetic Procedure of MoS2–xOx Nanosheets
Because it is
now well-known that oxygen incorporation is the effective
way to improve the SERS performance of nonmetal oxide semiconductors,12−19 in the next step, we have synthesized a 2D MoS2–xOx nanosheet. For this
purpose, we have developed a MoS2–xOx nanosheet, via annealing of 2D MoS2 at 350 °C temperature in air. The pure products are
characterized by SEM and other spectroscopic and microscopic techniques,
as reported in Figure S1.

4.5 Synthesis of the MoS2–xOx–GNP Hybrid
To synthesize
AuNP-decorated MoS2–xOx nanosheets, 5.0 mL of 10 nM
gold nanoparticle solution was dropped in 10 mL of 5 ppm of dispersed
in freshly prepared MoS2–xOx solutions in PBS buffer and the mixture
was sonicated for 2 h at room temperature. The mixture was continuously
stirred at very low speed overnight at room temperature for the completion
of the reaction. To remove excess regents and buffer solution, the
mixed solution was washed with methanol two to three times by centrifugation
at 5000 rpm for 15 min followed by decantation. Finally, the AuNP-decorated
MoS2–xOx pellet was dried under vacuum at room temperature for a week. After
that, the purified MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid was characterized by powder
XRD, high-resolution tunneling electron microscopy, EDX spectroscopy,
and Raman spectroscopy, as reported in Figure S1A–G. The elemental molar ratios for MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid
were determined using inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometer
data and EDX data.

4.6 Superbug Sample Preparation
Carbapenem-resistant E. coli, drug-resistant Shigella, and Campylobacter superbugs were
cultured according to the ATCC protocol, as we have reported previously.6,11−16

4.7 Raman Experimental Details
We have
used a portable Raman probe for the fingerprint detection of different
superbugs, as we have reported previously.6,11−16 For the Raman experiments using MoS2–xOx–GNP hybrid and other
materials, we have used 670 nm light as the excitation light source
and a QE65000 spectrometer for Raman data collection.

4.8 3D FDTD Simulation
We have used the
3D FDTD simulation age for full-field electromagnetic wave calculations,
as we have reported previously.6,11−16 For the calculation, we have used a gold nanoparticle of 30 nm diameter
which is decorated on the MoS2–xOx nanosheet as we have observed experimentally.
670 nm was used as the incident wavelength and the entire process
has been performed under 0.001 nm mesh resolution and 4000 fs duration.11−16
