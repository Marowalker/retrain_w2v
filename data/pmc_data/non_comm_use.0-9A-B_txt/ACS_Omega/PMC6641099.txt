Silane
coupling agents are well-known as surface modifiers for
various kinds of silica (SiO2). However, in the present
research, it has been found that they can also work as “hammerlike
liquid” to pulverize different kinds of bulk amorphous SiO2 in aqueous systems. This new function was typically clarified
by using 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS) and bundles of chiral
SiO2 nanofibers (with average diameter of ∼10 nm)
as raw materials. By a simple reflux of the mixture of SiO2 nanofibers and excessive APS in pure H2O, the solid-containing
mixture turned into a completely clear solution that contained sub-10
nm, amine-modified, and water-soluble hybrid SiO2 sols
(HS-sols). Moreover, this solution showed blue luminescence under
ultraviolet irradiation. Furthermore, the circular dichroism and vibrational
circular dichroism spectra revealed that the HS-sols are optically
active even though the pristine chiral SiO2 nanofibers
were completely destroyed. It was considered that the chirality of
SiO2 nanofibers was due to the asymmetric arrangement of
Si and O atoms in chiral domains (<10 nm) on the Si–O–Si
network of SiO2, and these domains are still preserved
in chiral HS-sols. This green method has high potential for the recycling
of rich SiO2 sources to obtain functional SiO2 nanomaterials with applications such as optical display, imaging,
and chiral recognition. Also, it offers a tool for the analysis of
the structural properties of SiO2 on the molecular scale.

1 Introduction
Given
the fact that oxygen (O) and silicon (Si) are the two most
abundant elements in the earth’s crust, the formation of silica
(SiO2) by the linkage of Si–O–Si (siloxane)
has long been a great concert, which involves its worldwide biosilicification
in living beings and controllable synthesis in laboratories and industries.1−3 On the other hand, as the reverse process of SiO2 formation,
the dissolution, degradation, or pulverization of SiO2 by
the breakage of Si–O–Si are also of importance for the
following reasons: (1) it offers a great chance for the acquisition
of Si-containing products from rich bio- and synthetic-SiO2 resources; (2) it is necessary in some industries such as petroleum
extraction from silicate minerals; (3) it is desirable to remove or
reuse SiO2-based wastes and by-products (e.g., discarded
concrete blocks and SiO2 scales in industrial water systems);
(4) it also provides an alternatively top-down and large-scale synthesis
of nano-SiO2 from bulk SiO2; and (5) it is an
effective experimental toolbox to reveal the detailed structures and
formation mechanism of various kinds of SiO2 because the
subnano/nanoscale structural units of pristine SiO2 may
be preserved in the final ultrasmall nanoparticles (NPs).4−10

There are different kinds of chemical reagents reported for
the
breakage of Si–O–Si. Hydrofluoric acid and strong bases
are the common etchants for SiO2 by the formation of SiF6 complexes and silicate ions, respectively. However, these
etchants are poisonous or dangerous to human beings and environments.
Alcohol can react with SiO2 to form various Si-containing
chemicals (e.g., alkoxysilanes), but this process needs a high temperature
(over 200 °C) and catalysts of organic amines or metal hydroxides.4−6 Small organic carboxylic acids in their deprotonated state are also
used for the dissolution of SiO2 at room temperature but
with a long time (1–7 days).7,8 Unfortunately,
in this research with carboxylic acids, not much information was available
on the sizes and compositions of the final products after dissolution
processing. Sugar, together with organic amine catalysts, was reported
to digest the SiO2 gel or silicate minerals to reduce their
sizes down to 200–450 nm under ambient pressure and mild heating
(60–100 °C).9 In these treatment
processes, pristine SiO2 turned into Si-containing ions/molecules
or nano-SiO2 with sizes over tens of nanometers. However,
SiO2 NPs with sizes in the range of 1–15 nm is seldom
reported using a solution-based top-down way. In addition, even for
the developed bottom-up synthesis techniques such as the classical
sol–gel Stöber method, it is easy to modulate the size
of SiO2 NPs to over 20 nm but difficult below 20 nm. Reports
on the preparation of sub-10 nm SiO2 NPs are still limited,
which needs precise control on the hydrolysis and condensation of
SiO2 sources by using specially ultrasmall nanoreactors
or external additives to terminate the growth of the Si–O–Si
network.11−14 The SiO2 NPs (<10 nm) that lie in the special region
between the molecules and large-sized NPs are of interest to understand
the nucleation, growth, and basic structural properties of particles.
Moreover, the decreased sizes and the increased surface/volume ratios
also endow the sub-10 nm SiO2 NPs with unique physicochemical
properties.15,16 For example, in some biomedical
applications, sub-10 nm SiO2 NPs showed advantages over
larger-sized SiO2 ones, which included improved stability,
short-time accumulation in the body, and enhanced accuracy to specific
target organs. It is reported that some drug delivery and diagnostic
probes based on sub-10 nm SiO2 NPs have been approved for
clinical trial.17,18 Hence, it is encouraging to develop
novel and easy synthesis methods of sub-10 nm SiO2 NPs
with good stability.

Silane coupling agents (SCAs), with the
general formulation of
(RO)3SiR′, are well-known as “surface modifiers”
to introduce various functional groups onto SiO2.19−28 Generally, in this process of surface modification, the morphologies
and sizes of the original SiO2 are hardly changed. However,
in this work, it was surprisingly found that the suspension, which
contained 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane [APS, (CH3O)3Si(CH2)3NH2)], SiO2 powders, and water, turned into a clear solution after simply refluxing
around 100 °C for several hours. In this solution, sub-10 nm,
amine-modified, and water-soluble SiO2 NPs were produced.
In addition, this solution possessed blue photoluminescence (PL) under
ultraviolet (UV) light (350–365 nm). To the best of our knowledge,
there are seldom reports on the pulverization effect of SCAs to reduce
the size of SiO2. Here, we called this downsizing effect
of APS as “hammerlike liquid”, and this process is general
to many kinds of amorphous SiO2 powders.

Consequently,
it was expected that this method is useful not only
to prepare sub-10 nm SiO2 nanomaterials but also to reveal
the nanoscaled (<10 nm) structure information of pristine large-sized
SiO2 sources. In the past decades, increasing attention
has been paid to chiral inorganic nanomaterials, among which a series
of chiral SiO2 have been prepared.29 Most chiral SiO2 nanomaterials showed helical outward
shape with helix pitch sizes over tens of nanometers; so, the chirality
is closely related to the helical shape. However, chirality emerging
on sub-10 nm hybrid SiO2 sols (HS-sols) is seldom reported.
Previously, we have succeeded in the synthesis of chiral SiO2 nanofibers (length in sub micrometers and average diameter ∼10
nm).30 These SiO2 nanofibers
do not show typical chiral shapes, and therefore, the chirality is
speculated to originate from the asymmetric arrangement of Si and
O atoms in chiral domains (<10 nm) on the Si–O–Si
network of SiO2. To support this speculation, chiral SiO2 nanofibers were transformed into SiO2 NPs by virtue
of the aforementioned pulverization effect of APS. The existence of
chiral HS-sols was confirmed by the circular dichroism (CD) spectra,
suggesting that there are chiral domains (<10 nm) distributed on
SiO2 nanofibers and finally preserved in some sub-10 nm
SiO2 NPs. Hence, for the first time, this work also offered
a straightforward synthesis of sub-10 nm chiral SiO2 NPs
without helical appearances.

2 Results and Discussions
SCAs are frequently used as surface modifiers for various kinds
of SiO2. Two basic courses are involved in this surface
modification: one is the hydrolysis of alkoxy groups (Si-OR) of SCAs
into the silanol group (Si-OH), and the other is the condensation
among silanol to form siloxane (Si–O–Si) bonds. For
the latter one, it can occur among SCA molecules or between SCA and
SiO2 substrates. In reality, the surface modification is
more complicated and influenced by many factors such as solvents,
amount of water, molecular structures and concentrations of SCA, temperature,
and reaction time.26 For example, the hydrolysis
of alkoxy groups is prompted by water, and the processing in an aqueous
solvent will be advantageous to the homocondensation among the SCA
moieties in the reaction medium but disadvantageous to the condensation
between SCA and SiO2.19 Therefore,
the pure water medium is less used, although there are some reports
on aqueous systems with a low concentration of SCA at room temperature.
By contrast, to obtain a reproducible coating of SCA by confining
the condensation mainly at the interface between SCA and SiO2 substrates, the modification is usually conducted in organic solvents
(or an vapor phase) with a limited amount of water and a low concentration
of SCA (the mass ratio of SCA/SiO2 < 1:1) under a moderate
temperature.

However, in the present study, different from the
general consensus
described above, the conditions were set with a high concentration
of SCA, a pure H2O solvent, and a relatively high temperature
(100 °C). In a typical experiment, 0.10 g powder of chiral d-type SiO2 (d-SiO2) nanofibers
and 2 mL of APS were added into 15 mL of H2O and then refluxed
at 100 °C overnight. In this way, the suspension containing the
SiO2 powders (Figure 1a, inset) turned into a clear solution (Figure 1b, bottom inset). As shown
in Figure 1a, the d-type SiO2 nanofibers possessed an average diameter
of ∼10 nm and length of over several hundred nanometers. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Figure 1b) of this solution showed that there were
well-dispersed colloidal NPs, and their sizes were mainly distributed
in the range less than 10 nm (Figure 1b, inset). From the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) analysis (Figure 1c), Si and O elements were detected. Because of a carbon film-coated
Cu grid used, Cu and C elements also appeared. Thus, the C element
should come both from the aminopropyl group of −(CH2)3NH2 and the carbon film. Consequently, from
the TEM and EDX results, sub-10 nm HS-sols were produced. Furthermore,
it was of interest to check whether this processing is general to
various kinds of SiO2, and hence, other kinds of amorphous
SiO2 were also tested, including chiral l-type
SiO2 nanofibers, achiral SiO2 nanofibers (those
nanofibers with morphologies and sizes similar to those of d-type SiO2 nanofibers above), commercial granular SiO2 gel (diameter ≈ 3.35 mm), and SiO2 gel
60 (diameter ≈ 0.063–0.200 mm). For all of these amorphous
SiO2, a clear solution could be obtained (Table S1 and Figure S1). However,
when quartz sand powders (a kind of crystalline SiO2) were
used, most solid powders still remained in the suspension even after
prolonging the refluxing time. This method is general and effective
to amorphous SiO2.

solution). (c) EDX spectra of (b).

To understand this process, the clear solution was subjected
to
freeze-drying to collect the corresponding solid products. Then various
characterizations were carried out on both liquid and solid products.
On the liquid (Figure 2a) and solid (Figure 2c) carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra,
three peaks with chemical shifts around 11, 25–27, and 43–45
ppm are present, which are attributed to the three carbon atoms on
the aminopropyl group of −CH2–CH2–CH2–NH2 (labeled as C1, C2,
and C3 in Figure 2a,
inset), respectively.19,22 On the liquid-state sample, there
is a strong and sharp peak around 49 ppm, which should be assigned
to methanol (CH3OH) resulting from the hydrolysis of the
methoxy group (CH3O−). However, this peak was not
present in the solid product, which was because of the evaporation
of methanol during freeze-drying. This demonstrated that the hydrolysis
of APS occurred in the aqueous system. On the liquid (Figure 2b) and solid (Figure 2d) 29Si NMR spectra,
six peaks around −50, −58 to −59, −67,
−90, −99 to −101, and −108 to −113
ppm were observed, which correspond to the units of T1 ((OH)2–R′Si–OSi), T2 ((OH)–R′Si–(OSi)2), T3 (R′Si–(OSi)3), Q2 ((OH)2–Si–(OSi)2), Q3 ((HO–Si–(OSi)3), and Q4 (Si–(OSi)4), respectively.19,22 In the control experiment, only APS was added into water and refluxed
at 100 °C overnight to get a clear solution, and then, this solution
was subjected to freeze-drying to form a solid product, which was
further characterized using solid 29Si NMR (Figure S2a). On this spectrum, only two peaks
appeared due to the bonds of T2 and T3. Also, the 29Si
NMR spectra of pristine d-SiO2 nanofibers are
shown in Figure S2b, where three peaks
arising from Q2, Q3, and Q4 were observed. Apparently, T1, T2, and
T3 were generated from the hydrolysis and condensation of APS, whereas
Q2, Q3, and Q4 were from the pristine SiO2. Therefore,
the 29Si NMR spectra shows that the SiO2 nanofibers
could be downsized into HS-sols. Compared with T2 and T3, the peak
intensities of Q2, Q3, and Q4 are lower, which is due to the lower
content of SiO2 compared with that of APS.

liquid sample; (c) 13C NMR, (d) 29Si NMR, (e)
FTIR spectra, and (f) TG–DTA curves of the solid sample.

On the Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra (Figure 2e) of the solidified sample,
the following peaks and their corresponding groups could be assigned:
3000–3500 cm–1 (N–H), 2800–3000
cm–1 (C–H), 1570, 1500, 1330, and 700 cm–1 (N–H), 1130, 1040, and 440 cm–1 (Si–O–Si).19,27 The thermogravimetric–differential
thermal analysis (TG–DTA) (Figure 2f) shows that the mass loss between 150 and
800 °C is approximately 34% in the solidified product, with three
exothermic peaks around 300, 390, and 440 °C, which are caused
by the decomposition of organic groups. In this reaction system, according
to the formula of APS, the sum mass of {C, N, H} elements (from aminopropyl
groups) and the sum mass of {Si, O} elements in APS are 0.32 and 0.42
g, respectively. Together with 0.10 g d-type SiO2 used, the calculated sum mass of {C, N, H} in the final products
is 38 wt %, which is close to the value of 34% obtained from TG–DTA.

In this work, one important concern is about the chirality of the
chiral SiO2 nanofibers. Also, the chirality of pristine
SiO2 is useful to further confirm the pulverization of
chiral SiO2 nanofibers because the as-formed HS-sols may
carry the chiral information of pristine SiO2, which can
be judged by the CD spectra. The as-used chiral d-type and l-type SiO2 nanofibers were prepared by using chiral
organic objects as morphological templates and chirality sources according
to our previous research.30 These nanofibers
showed a high-temperature (up to 900 °C)-resistant chirality,
which was supposed to be related with the chiral domains (<10 nm)
randomly distributed on the SiO2 nanofibers. Hence, to
check whether the chirality remained on the HS-sols derived from the d- and l-type SiO2 nanofibers, the CD and
vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra, together with the corresponding
absorption spectra, of these HS-sols-containing solutions were recorded.
Because there are no characteristic absorption bands for SiO2 in the range between 200 and 800 nm, the chirality of SiO2 was remotely analyzed by the induced optical activities of the guest
chromophores absorbed on the chiral active sites of SiO2. Here, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (MNQ) (Figure 3a, inset) was adsorbed onto the powders of
chiral SiO2 nanofibers, and tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin
(TCPP) (Figure 3b,
inset) was added into HS-sols-containing solutions. In both cases,
the CD signals near the absorption bands of MNQ (300 and 360 nm) (Figure 3a) or TCPP (410 nm)
(Figure 3b) were observed,
and the signals for d-type and l-type SiO2 were opposite to each other to form a mirror–image relationship.
In addition, in the range of 185–210 nm (Figure 3c), there was a pair of signals with mirror
relation appearing on the CD spectra for d- and l-type HS-sols-containing solution. The signals were centered at ∼200
nm, corresponding to the absorption peaks on the UV–vis spectra.
We confirmed that their ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorption spectra are similar to those of the aqueous sample obtained
from the control experiment containing APS and H2O (data
not shown). Thus, the CD signals around 200 nm would be attributed
to the aminopropyl groups. This means that the aminopropyl groups
were bound to chiral HS-sols and showed induced CD optical activity.
The CD spectra above were measured in transitions located in the UV
and visible regions, and as an extension, VCD spectra embraced those
in the infrared (IR) and near infrared (NIR) range. Therefore, VCD
could be
directly applied to the HS-sols-containing solution without monitoring
the external chromophores. On the VCD spectra of the solutions from d- and l-type SiO2 nanofibers (Figure 3d), a mirror–image
relationship also appeared with VCD signals corresponding to the IR
absorption bands of Si–O–Si (1000–1200 cm–1), indicating the intrinsic chirality of SiO2. In other previous research, the VCD signals were also observed
in helical SiO2, nonhelical mesoporous SiO2,
and chiral polysilsesquioxanes. However, the shapes, wavenumber locations,
and intensities of the VCD signals are sample-specific and dependent
on the morphologies, sizes, structures, and compositions of the chiral
SiO2.31−33 In some cases, there is a shift in the wave numbers
between VCD peaks and IR absorption peaks. It is generally considered
that the VCD signals result from the chiral arrangement of Si–O–Si
bonds, however, the detailed numbers, lengths, and angles of Si–O–Si
bonds are difficult to be provided to explain the VCD signals. Anyway,
both the CD and VCD spectra give evidence of the chiral HS-sols and
also imply some structural information of the SiO2 nanofibers,
which will be further discussed below.

IR spectra (bottom) of HS-sols-containing solutions.

What is more, it is interesting to find that both
the liquid and
solidified products are blue luminescent under UV irradiation (Figure 4a,b, insets). As
shown in the PL spectra (Figure 4), the clear solution excited at 350 or 365 nm showed
an emission at around 425–430 nm, whereas the emission wavelength
showed a short blue shift to 410–420 nm in the solid state
after freeze-drying. On the excitation spectra, it was found that
three peaks around 250, 300, and 350 nm were related to the emission.
However, the emission intensity excited at 250 nm was weak. It was
worth noting that this blue luminescent property was shared for all
solutions obtained using the five kinds of SiO2 mentioned
above (Figure S1).

liquid and (b) solid state
product after freeze-drying [insets, the digital images of the corresponding
products under sunlight (left) and UV irradiation of 365 nm (right)].

In the following parts, attention
was paid to the following issues:
(1) the possible pulverization mechanism of SiO2 powders;
(2) the chirality feature of SiO2 nanofibers and NPs; and
(3) the possible reasons for the observed photoluminescence. To understand
the process, the influence of refluxing time was checked. By quenching
the reaction system with d-type SiO2 nanofibers
and APS after a given refluxing time (1 and 2 h), the suspension was
subjected to centrifugation, and the solid residues were separated
from the upper clear solution. The powder fractions (nonreacted) recovered
at the reaction time of 1 and 2 h were approximately 33 and 10 wt
%, respectively. When it came to 3 h, nearly all SiO2 powders
were dissolved. TEM images of the solutions obtained after refluxing
for 1 and 2 h are shown in Figure 5a,b. After 1 h, both short nanofibers (diameter <
10 nm) and small NPs (<10 nm) could be seen. These short nanofibers
should come from the pristine long d-SiO2 nanofibers,
as shown in Figure 1a. After 2 h, the nanofibers were hardly found and the main products
were sub-10 nm NPs. However, the aggregation of these NPs was serious.
In addition, the SEM images of pristine d-type SiO2 nanofibers and the as-collected solid products at 1 and 2 h are
shown in Figure 6.
The d-type SiO2 powders appeared as irregular
spheres (Figure 6a),
which are in fact composed of long nanofibers in accordance with the
TEM image in Figure 1a. After refluxing for 1 h (Figure 6b), irregular and platelike particles broken from fibrous
bundles were formed. In this stage, the initial bundles of nanofibers
were completely destroyed. After 2 h (Figure 6c), the platelike particles were rarely observed,
and the sizes of nanoplates further decreased. As the reaction proceeded
to 3 h, the solid fractions in the mixture disappeared, and the reaction
solution became transparent.

refluxing for (a)
1 and (b) 2 h.

and high-magnification (right) SEM images
of (a) d-type SiO2 nanofibers and (b) solid products
collected after refluxing for 1 h and (c) 2 h.

Moreover, the effects of APS, H2O, and the temperature
were investigated using the following control experiments. From the
reaction mixture, after refluxing 0.10 g of SiO2 with different
amount of APS (0, 0.5, 1, and 2 mL) at 100 °C, the powder fraction
(nonreacted) recovered was 0.09, 0.06, 0.00, and 0.00 g. When other
amine-containing reagents such as ammonia and polyethyleneimine (PEI)
were used to replace APS, most pristine SiO2 powders remained
in the suspension. Hence, it was believed that APS played a key role
in the pulverization of SiO2. By fixing the amount of SiO2 at 0.10 g and APS at 2 mL, four different temperatures (25,
50, 75, and 100 °C) were checked. At 25 °C, even if the
time was prolonged to be 48 h, 0.08 g of the powder was left. With
the temperature increasing from 50 to 75 and to 100 °C, the recovery
powders were 0.06, 0.01, and 0.00 g, respectively. At a higher temperature
of 150 °C, all SiO2 powders could be dissolved after
a shorter time of 1.5 h.

As demonstrated by the above 13C NMR, FTIR and CD spectra,
the aminopropyl groups are present in the final HS-sols products,
and the final clear sols solutions are also stable even after placing
it for a long time of over 1 year without aggregation or precipitates.
Moreover, the solidified products, obtained by freeze-drying of the
HS-sols solution, could be redissolved in water to form a clear solution
again. In some previous reports, silica NPs synthesized by the cocondensation
between tetramethoxysilane and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane showed
good water solubility, which is closely related to the amine-modified
surfaces.34,35 To further confirm the stability of the
HS-sols, the solution samples obtained at different refluxing times
were subjected to zeta potential measurement. From Figure S3, it can be seen that the zeta potential value changed
gradually from negative (−18.42 mV at 1 h) to positive (+33.69
mV at 12 h) with increasing reaction time. However, the corresponding
pH values (around 11.2) of the solutions hardly change. First, the
long SiO2 nanofibers are not completely disconnected, and
there are a lot of hydroxyl groups on the surface on SiO2; hence, it is reasonable to find a negative zeta potential. However,
with excess of APS and increasing reaction time, the dynamic interaction
between APS and SiO2 nanofibers (or SiO2 nanofibers-derived
intermediates) still continued, and the SiO2 nanofibers
were downsized into small NPs. Meanwhile, the positive zeta potential
implied that the surface of the SiO2 NPs was also modified
by the amine groups from APS.

On the basis of the above results,
a plausible mechanism for the
pulverization of SiO2 nanofibers into amine-modified HS-sols
was proposed, as shown in Scheme 1. In the pure H2O solvent, the hydrolysis
of APS occurred very easily and can be expressed in the process labeled
as (1) in Scheme 1,
where the methoxy groups turn into hydroxyl groups. However, the followed
condensation of Si–OH to form Si–O–Si was complex
as it included the condensation among hydrolyzed APS and also that
between hydrolyzed APS and SiO2 nanofibers. For simplicity,
we first consider the condensation [process (2) in Scheme 1] between hydrolyzed APS and
SiO2 surfaces, which enable the aminopropyl groups be grafted
onto the surface of SiO2. As pointed out in a previous
research on the surface modification of SiO2 using SCAs,
the cleavage of siloxane (Si–O–Si) on the surface may
happen, which is likely caused by the nucleophilic attack of amine
groups and H2O, as shown in process (3) in Scheme 1.28 Generally, it is suggested that the breakage of siloxane is induced
by two factors: (1) the protonation of siloxane oxygen (acid catalysis)
and (2) the withdrawal of proton by bases.36 According to this mode, there should be a synergistic effect between
water and amine groups. The ionic product for water (Kw) increases with temperature from 10–14 (25 °C) to 10–12 (100 °C), which enhances
the concentration of H+ and OH– ions
and weakens the hydrogen bonding. Correspondingly, the protonation
of siloxane oxygen became easier at a high temperature,37 which facilitated the nucleophilic attack of
amine groups to break the Si–O–Si bond. Under a high
concentration of APS and a high temperature, the available amine groups
and the activity of water were enhanced, which ensured processes (2)
and (3) be sustainable to downsize SiO2 powders. As a result,
processes (2) and (3) could be regarded as a “hammerlike liquid”
to pulverize long SiO2 nanofibers into small HS-sols.

Scheme 1 Plausible Formation Mechanism from Large-Size SiO2 Nanofibers
to Ultrasmall Amine-Modified Silica NPs (HS-Sols)
It is sure that the surface of SiO2 NPs was modified
by amine groups, which occurred in process (2) shown in Scheme 1. Because of the condensation
among the hydrolyzed APS [process (4) in Scheme 1], the grafted APS on HS-sols could further
interact with the APS in the aqueous medium or on the surface of the
neighboring HS-sols. In this way, by prolonging the refluxing time,
both the silica powders and APS were exhausted to form HS-sols structured
by aminopropyl groups-modified silica clusters (see the mode in Scheme 1). Then, the steric
hindrance of the as-formed organosiloxane network and the electrostatic
repulsion of amine groups may restrain further pulverization and also
improve the stability and dispersibility of HS-sols. Thus, there are
two roles of APS in pulverization of SiO2 powders: first,
as an “attacker” to pulverize large SiO2 and
then, as a “protector” to stabilize small silica clusters.

Chirality is common in organic chemistry, whereas exploring inorganic
materials with chirality is an emerging area. For example, a series
of helical SiO2 have been prepared using various helical
organic objects as templates.29 The helix
pitches of these SiO2 are usually over tens of nanometers
(Scheme 2a), and the
chirality is therefore considered to be helix-handness and greatly
dependent upon the large-size helix structures. However, no helical
appearance was observed on our SiO2 nanofibers used here,
and the chirality is speculated to be correlated with the chiral domains
(<10 nm) randomly distributed through the nanofibers (Scheme 2b).44 In these domains, the array of a certain number of Si and
O atoms is asymmetric. Therefore, one big difference between the previous
helical SiO2 and the present SiO2 nanofibers
lies in the size scale for the chirality origin: the former is over
tens of nanometers, depending on the outward helix, whereas the latter
is below 10 nm, sprouting inside of the silica frame. The size difference
will influence the stability of chirality when subjected to top-down
size reduction. For example, as schematically shown in Scheme 2, if some destruction strategies
(e.g., high-temperature heating to removing the organic templates
and scaffolds, top-down pulverization) were used, the integrity of
helixes with pitch size over tens of nanometers would be destroyed
more easily than the small chiral domains (<10 nm), thus leading
to the disappearance of chirality on these helical SiO2. As shown in the TEM images (Figures 1 and 5), the morphologies and
sizes of the products in the solutions changed with increase in the
reaction time. To check the chirality change during the pulverization
of SiO2 nanofibers, the CD and VCD spectra of the as-collected
solutions (using l-type SiO2 as the SiO2 sources) at 1 and 2 h were also monitored and are shown in Figures S4 and S5. It was found the CD spectra
of the solutions obtained at 1 h (Figure S4a), 2 h (Figure S4b), and overnight (Figure 3c) are similar. However,
the anisotropic factor g (g = Δε/ε
= θ [mdeg]/33 000 A) at the wavelength of 200.5 nm was
calculated to be 1.7 × 10–4, 1.9 × 10–4, and 1.0 × 10–4 for 1 h, 2
h, and overnight, respectively. Also, the VCD spectra (Figures S5 and 3d) are
similar for these three solutions, and the value of g (at the wave numbers around 1107 cm–1) is 10.6
× 10–4, 6.8 × 10–4,
and 4.5 × 10–4 for 1 h, 2 h, and overnight,
respectively. Consequently, with the increase in the reaction time,
the g values calculated both from CD and VCD spectra
showed a decrease, indicating the weakening of chirality. Despite
the decrease in the g values, these small chiral
domains in SiO2 nanofibers possessed a relatively high
resistance to structural damage because of their sub-10 nm sizes.
As discussed above, an organosiloxane outer shell would form on the
inner fragment peeled from the chiral pristine SiO2 and
prevent further pulverization. Therefore, these chiral domains were
still left in the inner core of chiral HS-sols, thus making them be
chiral. Also, the hydrolyzed APS moieties grafted (or guest chromophores
absorbed) onto these chiral domains could show an induced chirality
as demonstrated by the CD signals in Figure 3b,c. It should be noted here that it is not
sure that all HS-sols in the solution are chiral because the chiral
domains may be destroyed in some HS-sols. This would result in the
weakening of chirality, as reflected by the decrease in the g values. For the moment, it is not easy to distinguish
the chiral HS-sols from the achiral ones. However, to some extent,
the results of this work also support our early assumption on the
chirality origin of the chiral SiO2 nanofibers.

Scheme 2 Comparison
on the Top-Down Pulverization Effect on the Chirality
Preservation Between (a) Large-Size Helical SiO2 and (b)
Chiral SiO2 Nanofibers
On the basis of the analysis of the pulverization mechanism
and
the structural and compositional properties above, the blue PL can
be briefly discussed below. PL has been observed on a series of SiO2, however, the reason for this phenomenon is still ambiguous
and considered to be relevant to both the intrinsic and extrinsic
defects on SiO2. For the blue PL observed in SiO2, some oxygen-related defects are considered to be important.38−41 In addition, another blue emitter is from the donor/acceptor pair
of NH–/NH3+, which is produced
by the proton transfer of amine groups when irradiated with UV light.42 This pair can work as hole and electron traps
to produce blue emission by the recombination of hole–electron.
To judge the possible blue light emission centers in the final HS-sols,
the PL spectra were also recorded in the following cases: (1) when
no silica was added, it was also luminescent, but, the intensities
were approximately one-third of those with SiO2 (Figure S6a); and (2) when the amount of APS decreased
to 0.5 mL (approximately 60% of SiO2 powders were not pulverized),
the luminescent intensities decreased greatly (Figure S6b). Therefore, it could be drawn that both the amount
of APS and SiO2 are important for the high luminescence.
During the pulverization process, as described in Scheme 1, both the breakage and rebuilding
of Si–O bonds occurred dynamically on the atomic scale. In
addition, some atoms were active due to the nanosize, and the oxygen-related
defects would form and then be embedded into the final Si–O–Si
network. The defect pair of NH–/NH3+ was intrinsically introduced by the aminopropyl groups in
APS. As these blue emitters show similar emission and excitation bands,
the overlap would enhance the luminescent intensities.

3 Conclusions
In summary, under an aqueous system, we found
a new function of
amine-containing SCAs of APS, which can pulverize different kinds
of large-size amorphous SiO2 powders into sub-10 nm and
water-soluble HS-sols. With an excessive amount of APS and refluxing
at 100 °C, the Si–O–Si linkage was supposed to
be broken by the synergic nucleophilic attack by amine and H2O, which not only led to the size reduction of pristine SiO2 but also resulted in an outer amine-containing Si–O–Si
network to form an amine-rich shell on the ultrasmall HS-sols. Consequently,
the HS-sols with an amine-rich surface showed high solubility and
dispersibility. Especially, when chiral SiO2 nanofibers
were used as sources, chiral sub-10 nm chiral silica NPs were obtained.
Using this simple and green processing, various SiO2 raw
materials can be top-down transferred into amine-functionalized HS-sols,
which would be potentially applicable in many areas by virtue of their
surface- and size-characteristics.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis of SiO2 Raw Materials
In this work, five kinds of SiO2 were used. Among them,
two kinds of commercial SiO2 gel were used as received,
including granular SiO2 gel (∼3.35 mm, from Wako
Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and SiO2 gel 60 (∼0.063
to 0.200 mm, from Merck KGaA). The other three kinds of SiO2 nanofibers, among which two kinds are chiral (including the l-type and d-type enantiomers) and another one is achiral,
were synthesized according to our previous research. These SiO2 nanofibers were prepared by using linear PEI as the template,
which is shown as follows.

4.1.1 Synthesis of PEI
PEI with a polymerization
degree of 500 was synthesized using the processes described in our
previous publication.43

4.1.2 Synthesis of Chiral SiO2 nanofibers30
4.1.2.1 Synthesis of PEI/Tart
Complexes
At approximately 100 °C, 0.63 g of PEI was
dissolved in 200
mL of water, and 0.60 g of d-type tartaric acid (tart) was
dissolved in another 200 mL of H2O. Then, these two solutions
were mixed, further heated under stirring for several minutes at approximately
100 °C, and finally cooled down to room temperature. After modulating
the pH to be around 4 using diluted ammonia, the solution was placed
overnight in a refrigerator to result in a white suspension, from
which chiral PEI/d-tartaric acid complex (denoted as PEI/d-tart) could be collected by centrifugation and washing with
water. PEI/l-tart complex was similarly prepared by simply
replacing d-tartaric acid with l-tartaric acid.

4.1.2.2 Synthesis of PEI/Tart@SiO2
The PEI/d-tart complex (or PEI/l-tart) collected
above was dispersed in 80 mL of H2O, to which 12 mL of
tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) was added. After stirring for 2 h at room
temperature, chiral PEI/d-tart@SiO2 (or PEI/l-tart@SiO2) powders were collected via centrifugation,
washing with water and acetone, and finally drying at 60 °C.

4.1.2.3 Synthesis of Chiral SiO2
The PEI/d-tart@SiO2 powders (or PEI/l-tart@SiO2) were calcinated at 600 °C for 3 h after
a heating program of 1 h from room temperature to 600 °C, which
offered chiral d-SiO2 (or l-SiO2) without organic components.

4.1.3 Synthesis
of Achiral SiO2 Nanofibers
PEI (0.316 g) was first
dissolved in 100 mL of water at around
100 °C. This clear solution became a white gel after slow-cooling
down to room temperature, to which 6 mL of TMOS was added. After stirring
for 2 h at room temperature, PEI@SiO2 powders were collected
by centrifugation, washing with water and acetone, and finally drying
at 60 °C. Finally, the PEI@SiO2 powders were also
calcinated at 600 °C for 3 h to form achiral SiO2.

4.2 Pulverization of SiO2 by APS
Typically, 0.10 g of SiO2 and 2 mL of APS were added
into 15 mL of H2O in a glass flask and then refluxed at
100 °C overnight. After cooling down to room temperature, a clear
solution was collected. On the other hand, freeze-drying of this clear
solution resulted in solid-state products. In other cases with different
amounts of SiO2 (or APS) and temperatures, if there were
solid powders left after overnight refluxing, the upper solution and
the unreacted solid powders were separated by centrifugation at 4000
rpm for 5 min, and these solid powders were further subjected to washing
with water and methanol and finally dried at 60 °C under vacuum.

4.3 Characterization
TEM images were
taken on a JEM-2100F instrument (accelerating voltage, 200 kV). The
solid and liquid 13C and 29Si NMR spectra were
recorded on a JEOL-ECX 400II and a JEOL-ECA600 instrument, respectively.
FTIR spectra were obtained using a JASCO FTIR-4600 spectrometer with
KBr as a reference. The CD and UV–vis absorption spectra in
the wavelength range of 200–800 nm were simultaneously acquired
on a JASCO J-820 spectropolarimeter equipped with a diffuse reflectance
CD (DRCD)-466L unit. The CD spectra and UV–vis spectra in the
wavelength range of 185–400 nm were recorded using a JASCO
J-720W spectropolarimeter. The VCD and IR spectra were simultaneously
obtained on a JASCO FVS-6000 VCD spectrometer. For the VCD test, the
as-obtained solution was first diluted with methanol and then smeared
onto the silicon wafer. The fluorescence spectra of the solid and
liquid samples were recorded on a JASCO FP-8300 and a Shimadzu RF-5300PC
spectrofluorophotometer, respectively. The TG–DTA analysis
was conducted on an Exstar 6000 instrument (Seiko Instruments Inc.).
The zeta potential test was carried out using a Zeecom zeta potential
analyzer (Microtec Co., Ltd.).
