Progeria
is a globally noticed rare genetic disorder manifested
by premature aging with no effective treatment. Under these circumstances,
farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are marked as promising drug
candidates. Correspondingly, a pharmacophore model was generated exploiting
the features of lonafarnib. The selected pharmacophore model was allowed
to screen the InterBioScreen natural compound database to retrieve
the potential lead candidates. A series of filtering steps were applied
to assess the drug-likeness of the compounds. The obtained compounds
were advanced to molecular docking employing the CDOCKER module available
with Discovery Studio (DS). Subsequently, three compounds (Hits) have
displayed a higher dock score and demonstrated key residue interactions
with stable molecular dynamics simulation results compared to the
reference compound. Taken together, we therefore put forth three identified
Hits as FTIs that may further serve as chemical spaces in designing
new compounds.

Introduction
Progeria is a rare genetic disease noticed
in children characterized
by premature aging that predominantly affects the skin, bones, and
cardiovascular system.1 This syndrome affects
one in 4–8 million births2 noticed
throughout the world with no gender or ethnic biasness.2 The post-translational modifications observed
in progerin were thought to demonstrate a predominant role in pathophysiology
of the disease.3 The protein progerin is
defined as a partially cleaved form of nuclear lamin A that is associated
with the dysfunctional nuclear membrane and premature senescence.4 The Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome
(also called progeria) is a result of a dominant point mutation triggered
in the nuclear lamin A gene that encodes major protein in exon 11
(C to T transition noticed at nucleotide 1824) leading to a silent
mutation resulting in Gly608 → Gly608.4 The so formed mutant exhibits a new
splicing donor site responsible for the formation of mutant lamin
A protein termed progerin. Structurally, progerin is devoid of a proteolytic
cleavage site essential for the elimination of the last 18 carboxyl-terminal
amino acids to generate mature lamin A.4 Progerin accumulation within the nuclei leads to the disruption
of the nuclear structure, thereby causing premature replicative senescence.5 Under such conditions, the farnesyltransferase
inhibitors (FTIs) have proven to be of great potential against progeria.6

Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are
small molecules that
can bind reversibly to farnesyltransferase at the (cysteine–aliphatic
amino acid–aliphatic amino acid–any amino acid) CAAX
binding site, correspondingly hindering progerin farnesylation and
intercalation into the membrane of the nucleus,7,8 thereby
improving the cardiovascular and skeletal pathologies and weight gain.2,9 Lonafarnib, one of the FTIs that is widely used to treat progeria,
has reached the clinical trials8,10 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00425607). Initially developed to treat cancer,11 they typically act by reversing the nuclear abnormalities12,13 that are hallmark characteristics associated with progeria-affected
children.

Encouraged by the beneficial effects of FTIs, there
is a dire need
to identify new drugs with similar abilities. Accordingly, in the
current study, we focused on virtual screening for new chemical compounds
that might have potential against progeria using the pharmacophore
method. In order to redeem the potential candidate compounds, the
compound lonafarnib was considered. Since lonafarnib has exhibited
encouraging results toward progeria, the current research intends
to find small molecules that demonstrate the pharmacophore features
(chemical features) that are manifested by lonafarnib. In this pursuit,
the investigation has proceeded by generating a pharmacophore model
employing the small molecule lonafarnib. The obtained model was escalated
to screen the chemical database to retrieve the compounds that map
with the pharmacophore features. A typical model incorporates a few
features arranged in 3D form14 and should
compose a repeated denominator of the molecular interaction features
existing in a group of molecules. Thus, pharmacophore is defined as
a pattern of features of a molecule that is responsible for a biological
effect.14 Such pharmacophore models are
upgraded to screen the small molecule chemical databases to obtain
the compounds complementary to the pharmacophore features.15 When a small molecule fits into the pharmacophore
spheres, they are termed Hits.14 The obtained
Hits will be allowed to dock with the specific protein target to delineate
the interactions between them at the atomic level16 and to predict the binding mode of the small molecules.17,18 The best poses from the molecular docking studies are thoroughly
studied by molecular dynamics simulation studies to elucidate on the
motions of atoms and molecules.19 The obtained
results are read as root mean square deviation (RMSD), potential energy,
radius of gyration (Rg), and the hydrogen bond number
as described earlier.20

Results and Discussion
Pharmacophore
Generation
Prior to the generation of
the pharmacophore model, the investigation has proceeded to identify
the key features of the compound lonafarnib by initiating the Feature
Mapping protocol available with the DS. This protocol has prompted
43 features. From the obtained results, it was evident that the features
such as hydrogen bond donor (HBD), hydrophobic (HyP), and aromatic
ring (RA) were identified as the repeated features. Utilizing the
lonafarnib, the auto pharmacophore was generated, which resulted in
10 pharmacophore models with the same features such as HyP, HBD, and
RA when the minimum interfeature distance was chosen as 2.5 and maximum
features as 5. Subsequently, the first model was chosen as it demonstrated
two RA, two HyP, and one HBD feature as illustrated in Figure 1.

features demonstrated by lonafarnib. (B) Interfeature distance between

Virtual Screening for Redeeming
Prospective Candidate Compounds
In order to retrieve the
potential candidate compounds from the
InterBioScreen natural compound database, the pharmacophore model
has been used as the 3D query. This database comprises approximately
around 59619 compounds. Upon applying the Ligand Pharmacophore Mapping,
3467 compounds were retrieved. These compounds were subjected to the
ADMET filters and Ro5, eventually procuring 239 compounds. The obtained
compounds were upgraded to molecular docking studies to evaluate the
binding affinities between the target protein and the ligands (Figure 2A).

features.

Molecular Docking Studies
Molecular docking studies
impart knowledge on the behavior of the small molecules at the active
site of the protein. For the current study, the virtually screened
compounds were docked against the target protein along with the reference
compound lonafarnib. Molecular docking results have demonstrated a
-CDOCKER interaction energy of 39.27 kcal/mol for lonafarnib. Therefore,
this score was set as an upper limit to select the prospective drug-like
candidates. Accordingly, 16 compounds from the largest cluster have
shown a higher dock score than the reference compound and were labeled
as Hits (active drug-like compounds) (Figure 2B). These compounds were then scrupulously
examined for the key residue interactions that resulted in three compounds
(Figure 2C). These
compounds were additionally noticed to be seated in the active site
as was seen with the reference compound and the cocrystallized compound.
Furthermore, these compounds have displayed the essential pharmacophore
features required for activity (Figure 2D). These compounds have generated better binding energies.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation Studies
Molecular dynamics
simulation logically demonstrates the conformational and molecular
behavior at atomistic levels and their movements, functions, and enzyme
mechanisms at the molecular level21 to
additionally infer the stabilities of the final complex compounds
employed as initial structures for simulations conducted for 20 ns.

Conformational Stability Analysis from MD Insight
For
the current investigation, MD guided stability analysis was executed
and read according to RMSD profiles, potential energy, and Rg.

Examining the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)
The
RMSD imparts knowledge on the stability of the protein backbone. The
results have demonstrated that the systems were largely stable throughout
the 20 ns simulation run without major variations (Figure 3A). All the systems have projected
an RMSD below 0.3 nm determining their stability. Upon calculating
the average deviation plot, it was found that the reference has demonstrated
an RMSD of 0.18 nm, with marginal elevation at 15000 ps. The compound
Hit1 has represented a stable RMSD existing below 0.25 nm with no
significant variations. However, the plot was stable after 5000 ps
displaying an average RMSD of 0.16 nm as noticed with the reference
compound (Figure 3A).
The Hit2 has denoted a stable RMSD below 0.25 nm with an average of
0.19 nm. A negligible rise in the RMSD graph was noticed at 6000 ps
and was stable thereafter without any fluctuations (Figure 3A). The compound Hit3 has displayed
an RMSD below 0.24 nm, with an average of 0.16 nm. Scrupulously analyzing
the RMSD profile of Hit3, an elevation was noted between 8000 and
12000 ps representing a deviation at 0.22 nm. However, a stable deviation
profile below 0.2 nm was observed from 12000 to 20000 ps (Figure 3A). The three Hits
have revealed a close stability as was seen with the reference compound,
with Hit3 seeming to project much better backbone stability than the
reference (Figure 3A).

compactness. (D) Enumerating the number of hydrogen bonds.

Studying the Potential Energy Profiles
The stability
of the system was additionally analyzed by the potential energy profiles.
Contemplating on the potential energies of all the systems, it was
found to be stable between −7.30 × 105 and
−7.45 × 105 kJ/mol as described in Figure 3B. The potential
energy of the reference compound was computed to be at −7.34
× 105 to −7.42 × 105 kJ/mol.
The compound Hit1 has shown a stable potential energy between −7.37
× 105 and −7.42 × 105 kJ/mol.
The potential energy for compound Hit2 was recorded to be between
−7.31 × 105 and −7.35 × 105 kJ/mol, and Hit3 represented the energy between −7.30
× 105 and −7.35 × 105 kJ/mol.
These results guide us to understand that the systems were stable
upon comparison with the reference (Figure 3B).

Inspecting the Radius of
Gyration
Additionally, Rg was investigated
that imparts knowledge on the compactness
of the protein.22 All the systems have
exhibited Rg scores between 2.1 and 2.2 nm. The average Rg value for the reference was calculated as 2.16 nm when
plotted against time. The Hit1 has displayed an Rg score of 2.15 nm, while Hit2 and Hit3 have projected values of
2.14 and 2.15 nm, respectively. These results demonstrate that the
Hits are highly compact compared to the reference compound, as illustrated
in Figure 3C.

Examining the Binding Mode of the Hits
Upon thorough
investigating the accomodation of the identified Hits at the active
site of the protein, it was observed that the Hits have occupied the
active site in the same pattern as that of the reference compound
and the cocrystallized ligand (Figure 4A). This guides us to predict that the Hits might also
act in a similar manner to the reference compounds complemented by
the key residue interactions.

Investigation for the Key Residue Interactions
Lonafarnib
Upon
examining the intermolecular interactions,
it was demonstrated that the compound lonafarnib has prompted two
hydrogen bonds with the residues Cys706 [Cys706:SG-H66 (2.2 Å)]
and Tyr800 [Tyr800:HH-N8 (2.0 Å)] rendered by an acceptable bond
length. The residues Arg702 [Arg702-reference (5.0 Å) alkyl]

Hit1
The compound
Hit1 has generated hydrogen bond
interactions with the residues Arg791 and Leu795 [Leu795:O-H47 (1.8
Å)]. Arg791 has projected two hydrogen bonds such as Arg791:HE-O14
(2.0 Å) and Arg791:HH21-O14 (1.7 Å). Furthermore, the residues
Lys794 [Lys794-Hit1 (4.2 Å) π–alkyl], and Trp803
[Trp803-Hit1 (4.2 Å) π–π T stacked] have formed
π–π/π–alkyl interactions. The residue

The Hit2 has formed hydrogen
bonds with key residues
such as His748 [His748:NE2-H31 (2.3 Å)], Asp797 [Asp797:OD1-H32
(1.8 Å)], and residue Tyr800 [Tyr800:OH-H31 (2.7 Å)]. The
residue Arg791 has formed two hydrogen bonds [Arg791:HE-O16 (1.7 Å)
and Arg791:HH21-O16 (2.2 Å)] with the ligand holding it firmly
at the active site. The SG atom of the residue Cys799 has prompted
two π–sulfur interactions with the ligand by lengths
of 5.2 and 5.3 Å. The residue Tyr800 has formed two π–π
stacked interactions with the ligand rendered by lengths of 5.7 and

Å.The residue Trp803 has interacted with the ligand by a π–π

Lys856, and Tyr861 have prompted the van der Waals interaction holding
the ligand firmly at the active site (Figure 4B and Table 1).

two hydrogen bonds
with the residues His748 [His748:NE2-H32 (2.0 Å)] and Tyr800

Furthermore, the residues Tyr654 [Tyr654-Hit3 (5.2 Å) π–π
stacked], Arg702 [Arg702-Hit3 (4.5 Å) π–alkyl],

Discussion
Progeria is a rare genetic disorder predominantly characterized
by premature aging. Of the different forms of progeria, the Hutchinson–Gilford
progeria syndrome is the widely studied one and has obtained the name
in honor of the scientists Jonathan Hutchinson (1886) and Hastings
Gilford (1897), who independently studied the syndrome.2 A farnesyltranferase inhibitor, lonafarnib has
demonstrated a good improvement in the conditions of the progeroid
children by weight gain, ameliorating cardiovascular and skeletal
pathologies.2 Therefore, this drug paves
a way for discovering and identifying new candidate drugs with similar
efficacies.

Computational drug discovery by virtue of pharmacophore
modeling
offers to redeem new candidate compounds displaying the key features
represented by a pharmacophore model. Accordingly, the current study
adapts to determine the key essential features imbibed by the “drug
of hope”2 lonafarnib. Correspondingly,
a five featured pharmacophore model was generated as represented in Figure 1 to secure the compounds
upon virtual screening with the same features. Upon subjecting to
virtual screening and subsequent computational methods, three compounds
were identified that have exhibited the key pharmacophore features
as in Figure 2.

In order to ensure that the pharmacophore has retrieved the potential
candidates, the bioactive conformation of the lonafarnib (herein after
referred to as lonaA) was retrieved from the protein data bank bearing
the PDB code 1O5M, from the organism Rattus norvegicus. Initially, the RMSD was analyzed between the lonaA and the lonafarnib
by enabling the Calculate RMSD option furnished with the DS with all
the default parameters. The result has shown that both compounds have
aligned with each other rendered by an RMSD of 2 Å as described
in Figure 5A. Although
no difference was observed between compounds, a marginal difference
was observed at the benzene as indicated in Figure 5B. The pharmacophore model was allowed to
map with lonaA, and the results inferred that the pharmacophore model
has well mapped with lonaA, as demonstrated in Figure 5C validating that the model was capable enough
to retrieve the active compounds from a larger data set.

the bioactive form of lonafarnib and the retrieved
compound. (A) Both compounds have aligned perfectly. (B) The marginal
difference in the alignment was noticed as indicated in the pink oval.
(C) The lonaA represents all the pharmacophore features.

Furthermore, upon viewing at the targets, 1TN6 (current target
employed in the study with FPP analog) and 1O5M, the protein containing the lonaA, some
interesting observations can be drawn. Subsequent superimposition
of both structures has revealed that the targets have aligned well
with each other along with the FPP ligand of both target structures
as in Figure 6A. Notably,
the FPP was observed to be buried deep into the active site groove
as described in Figure 6B, as compared with the lonaA. Therefore, we have chosen the target
with an FPP analog as the cocrystal, logically to choose the compounds
with lonafarnib chemical features that could interact well with the
target residues. Likewise, the Hit compounds identified were noticed
to occupy the FPP binding site gaining entry into the defined active
site groove as described in Figure 4A. These findings guide us to comprehend that the identified
Hits may act as potential FTIs.

align perfectly along with the FPP and the analog.
(B) The small molecule FPP is buried into the active site groove,
while the lonaA is at the peripheral of the binding pocket.

Upon considering the intermolecular interactions,
it was observed
that lonafarnib, Hit 2, and Hit3 have generated a hydrogen bond interaction
with Tyr800 as was noticed in the crystal structure (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1tn6). Another key residue, Arg791 has prompted a hydrogen bond interaction
with Hit1 and Hit2 as was in the crystal structure; however, in lonafarnib
and Hit3, it has demonstrated a van der Waals interaction. Interestingly,
the Hits have prompted the π–sulfur interactions that
was absent in the cocrystal and the reference compound. Further delineating
the number of hydrogen bond, it was evident that the Hits have projected
a higher number than the lonafarnib as in Figure 3D. The compound lonafarnib has generated
an average of 0.2 hydrogen bonds, while the Hits have formed 1.2,
1.3, and 1.6, respectively. Additionally, the Hits have represented
a higher number of π interactions and van der Waals interactions
holding the ligand firmly at the active site of the protein. This
result affirms that the identified Hits may act as alternative chemical
spaces with a similar impact to lonafarnib.

Furthermore, it
was observed that the identified Hits have demonstrated
a different scaffold from the reference while representing the key
features of the pharmacophore model. Additionally, the Hits have projected
different atoms such as oxygen atoms, nitrogen atoms, and sulfur atoms.
Hit1 has demonstrated nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The HBD pharmacophore
feature has resulted in one hydrogen bond with the residue Leu795,
and the oxygen atoms present amidst two hydrophobic features have
formed another hydrogen bond with the residue Arg791 (Figure 7A). In Hit2, the HBD feature
has prompted three hydrogen bonds with the residues His748, Arg791,
and Tyr800. Another hydrogen bond was formed with the residue Asp797
that is in proximity to the HyP feature (Figure 7B). Hit3 has formed two hydrogen bonds, one
with the residue His748 that is complimentary to the HBD feature and
Tyr800 that exists in close vicinity to the HyP feature (Figure 7C). Notably, the
HBD features have participated in the interactions by hydrogen bonding
involving the key residues with all the Hits, while the RA and HyP
features have prompted either π–interactions or van der
Waals interactions (Figure 7). Therefore, it can be speculated that these features might
be essential features. These results guide us to understand that the
Hits might act as prospective FTIs.

Conclusions
Progeria has been one
of the dreadful syndromes noticed in children
characterized by premature aging with no effective treatment until
now. FTIs have been proven effective against progeria with lonafarnib
entering the clinical trials. Therefore, in the current investigation,
we tried to identify novel scaffolds that obey the pharmacophore features
of lonafarnib. The molecular docking studies have identified three
compounds that have demonstrated key residue interactions and have
occupied the FPP analog binding site as was noticed in the crystal
structure. From the obtained results, it can be stated that the identified
compounds may act as potential agents against progeria and further
may serve as new scaffolds in developing novel drugs.

Materials and
Methods
Auto Pharmacophore Modeling
Lonafarnib is a well-known
compound employed to treat progeria10,23 that might
improve the neurologic conditions by correspondingly inhibiting farnesyltransferase.
Therefore, the chemical features of this compound were exploited utilizing
the Auto Pharmacophore Generation protocol accessible with the Discovery
Studio v4.5 and v18 (DS). The Auto Pharmacophore Generation protocol
is primarily used to generate the pharmacophore from a single ligand.
Correspondingly, utilizing the inbuilt features such as Hydrogen bond
acceptor (HBA), Hydrogen bond donor (HBD), Hydrophobic feature (HyP),
Negative ionizable feature (ION), Positive ionizable feature (IOP),
and Aromatic ring (RA), a set of prospective pharmacophore models
were generated reflecting the aforementioned features. Furthermore,
this module selects the pharmacophore with highest selectivity in
accordance with the Genetic Function Approximation (GFA) model prediction.

Virtual Screening of the InterBioScreen Database To Retrieve
the Potential Compounds
The pharmacophore model was used
as a 3D query to retrieve the chemical compounds complementary to
the pharmacophore features. Correspondingly, for the current investigation,
a humongous InterBioScreen natural compound database was used. The
pharmacophore model was allowed to map with the compounds enabling
the Ligand Pharmacophore Mapping module equipped with the DS. The
resultant compounds were subjected to drug-like assessment employing
the ADMET Descriptors and Filter by Lipinski tools available with
the DS. The compounds that have obeyed these criteria were upgraded
to the molecular docking studies.

Molecular Docking Studies
and Binding Energy Calculations
The obtained compounds from
the virtual screening strategies were
escalated to the molecular docking studies to evaluate the binding
affinities between the protein and the obtained compounds and thereby
to expel false positives.16 The molecular
docking studies additionally define the predictive binding modes of
the ligand at the protein active site. For the current investigation,
the CDOCKER program available with the DS was utilized that operates
on the CHARMm-based molecular docking method to dock ligands into
a proteins binding site, thereby generating random ligand conformations
upon using high-temperature molecular dynamics (MD).

The CDOCKER
is a grid-based docking mechanism that operates by the CDOCKER algorithm,24 which allows the refined docking for a single
protein target against a large number of ligands. During the molecular
docking method, random conformations are generated for the initial
ligand conformation by the high-temperature molecular dynamics, which
was accompanied by the random rotations. Furthermore, the random rotations
are further explored according to grid-based (GRID 1) simulated annealing.
The molecular docking simulations were executed opting the simulated
annealing as True while keeping the other options as default.

The protein for the current study is farnesyltransferase bearing
a protein data bank (PDB) code of 1TN6 with a cocrystallized ligand FPP analog.25 The protein was prepared by the Clean protein
option equipped in the DS after removing the water molecules and furnishing
the missing hydrogen atoms using the CHARMm force field. The active
site residues are marked for all the atoms at 10 Å around the
inbound ligand. Correspondingly, the residues such as His748, Gly750,
Cys754, Arg791, Lys794, Try800, and Trp803 were identified as key
residues. The compounds obtained from the virtual screening were minimized
and were imported to DS to generate their 3D structures. During the
molecular docking studies, each ligand was allowed to generate 50
conformations that were clustered. The best pose was chosen from the
largest cluster demonstrating the highest dock score compared to lonafarnib
(drug in the clinical trials).

The binding free energies are
calculated between the ligands and
the receptor employing Calculate Binding Energies equipped in DS using
the default settings. Furthermore, this parameter provides an opportunity
to compute the average binding energy for a group of related poses
and loss of conformational entropy and energy of a bound ligand.26 The binding energy is calculated using the following
equation: EnergyBinding = EnergyComplex –
EnergyLigand – EnergyReceptor.

Molecular
Dynamics Simulation Studies
Molecular dynamics
simulation studies were launched to elucidate the dynamic behavior
of small molecules at protein active sites and were conducted as described
earlier.27,28 In order to accomplish this, the GROMACS
v5.0.6 package was employed with the CHARMm 27 force field29 obtaining the ligand topologies from SwissParam.30 A double level equilibration was conducted by
utilizing a constant number of particles, volume, and temperature
(NVT) and constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature
(NPT), executed for 1 ns each with a V-rescale thermostat and Parrinello–Rahman
barostat, correspondingly. The simulation run was conducted for 20
ns, and the obtained results were read as root mean square deviation
(RMSD), potential energy, radius of gyration (Rg),
and hydrogen bond analysis.
