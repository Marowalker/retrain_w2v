Biomimetic
synthesis of multifunctional fluorescent gold nanoclusters
(Au NCs) is of great demand because of their ever-increasing applications.
In this study, we have used self-assembled bovine serum albumin (BSA)
amyloid-like nanofibers as the bioinspired scaffold for the synthesis
of Au NCs. The amyloid fibril stabilized gold nanocluster (Fib-Au
NC) has been found to have appreciable enhancement of fluorescence
emission and a large 25 nm red shift in its emission maxima when compared
to its monomeric protein counterpart (BSA-Au NC). The underlying mechanism
accountable for the fluorescence behavior and its spectral shift has
been thoroughly investigated by a combined use of spectroscopic and
microscopic techniques. We have subsequently demonstrated the use
of Fib-Au NCs for cysteine (Cys) sensing both in vitro and inside
live cells. Additionally, cellular uptake and postpermeation effect
of Fib-Au NCs have also been ascertained by detailed flow cytometry
analysis, viability assay, and real-time apoptotic gene expression
profiling.

Introduction
Biomimicking
synthesis of fluorescent nanoscale materials has generated
widespread interest in the research ecosystem of material science
and engineering.1−3 Proteins are often used as templates for biomimicking
synthesis of fluorescent noble metal nanoclusters4−10 with defined properties and applications in contemporary biomedicinal
research.11−13 The pioneer work of Xie et al.4 first described the synthesis of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-encapsulated
fluorescent gold nanoclusters (Au NCs). Different protein systems
have been explored for this purpose, including the fibrous proteins,14,15 cage proteins,16−18 heat shock proteins,19,20 and others.

A number of proteins are known to form highly organized fibrillar
cross-β-sheet structures, popularly known as amyloid fibrils.
These fibrils are typically self-assembled robust nanostructures held
together by weak non-covalent forces between β-sheets. The formation
of amyloid fibrils is implicated in the pathology of several neurodegenerative
diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease, ALS, Creutzfeldt–Jakob, prion diseases, and type II
diabetes. Although disease causing amyloid fibrils have attracted
major attention, nontoxic and functional amyloid fibrils are also
known, which are shown to have defined functions in multiple systems,
ranging from bacteria to humans. Some of these functions include mammalian
skin pigmentation,21 catabolism,22 hormone storage,23 epigenetic inheritance, and memory formation.24 Amyloid fibrils have also been used as building blocks
for functional materials such as conductive nanowires,25 photovoltaic devices,26 biosensors,27 hybrids,28 cell scaffolds,29 optoelectronic
devices,30 artificial bones,31 underwater adhesives,32 liquid-crystal formation,33 and so forth.
More specifically, amyloid fibers developed from lysozyme were found
to electrostatically direct the assembly of gold nanoparticles along
the fibers into arrays with tunable particle spacing.34 Such applications are only possible because of precisely
assembled fibrillar structures, tunable molecular functionalities,
binding affinities, excellent mechanical strength, and high stability
over a wide range of harsh conditions including chemical alteration
at the nanoscale range. Self-assembled protein fibrils may act as
a “bioamplifier” in the context to fabrication of nanoscale
materials, and a number of recent publications have been successful
in this regard. One example is shown by Garcia et al., where they
have reported the synthesis of fluorescent gold nanoclusters using
human insulin fibril with emission maxima at 620 nm.35 In this study, we have used BSA fibrils as the synthesis
template to develop Fib-Au NCs. This methodology is also advantageous
as a “green” synthetic model with cost-effective devise
arrangements.

BSA is a globular plasma protein, which constitutes
∼60%
of the total protein pool. It contains 583 amino acid residues in
three similar structural domains (predominantly α-helical) adapting
a heart-shaped configuration. It has 17 disulfide bonds and a free
unpaired cysteine (Cys) at the 34th position. This Cys residue assists
in the dimerization and subsequent higher-order self-association.
We have found that the synthesis of Au NCs within BSA fibrils (Fib-Au
NCs) not only amplifies the fluorescence intensity, but also results
in a distinct 25 nm red shift. In addition, Fib-Au NC has been found
to offer important applications in Cys biosensing.

Cys plays
crucial roles in retaining a cellular antioxidant immune
system, biocatalysis, posttranslational modifications, cellular metabolism,
and detoxification.36 Variation in Cys
concentration thus affects biological processes within cells. Its
deficiency leads to diseases like haematopoieses, leucocyte loss,
hair depigmentation, psoriasis, and so forth, whereas neurotoxicity,
cardiovascular, and Alzheimer’s diseases are linked to its
elevated levels.37 Among various analytical
techniques, high-performance liquid chromatography and postcolumn
derivatization and a spectrophotometric assay using Ellman’s
reagent are the most common for estimation of Cys in biological samples.36,37 However, the technique involves skilled manpower, expensive equipment,
and time-consuming processes. In biological fluids, two other sulfhydryl
(−SH) compounds, namely homocysteine (Hcy) and glutathione
(GSH), are available along with Cys. As a result, specific quantification
of Cys adds to further complications. In this work, we show that Fib-Au
NCs detect and monitor Cys at a very low level limit and with significant
specificity when compared to its detection of Hcy and GSH. The synthesized
nanocluster probe can also be used conveniently inside live cells
for cellular imaging, in which the presence of Cys alters emission
output.

Live cell imaging has been carried out using synthesized
NCs, where
the probe has shown significant localized intracellular red fluorescence
using excitation at 488 nm. The Fib-Au NC is found to show considerable
cell permeability. More importantly, cells have not shown any sign
of postpermeation stress. Our ensemble in cell studies involving flow
cytometry and MTT assays over a gradient of NC concentrations reveals
an efficient and rapid cytosolic permeation with very high cell viability
and minimum apoptotic and necrotic events. Furthermore, as suggested
by our real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies, the NC treatment
is found to alter the gene expression levels of apoptotic genes. These
strings of in-cell studies suggest that NC can be a potential synthetic
species for bioimaging purposes with no concurrent deleterious effects
on live cells.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
of BSA Fibrils Stabilized Gold
Nanoclusters (Fib-Au NCs)
The synthesis of BSA fibril-stabilized
gold nanoclusters involved two steps. In the first step, BSA fibrils
were prepared, which were subsequently used in the second step as
the template for the development of fibril-stabilized gold nanoclusters
(Fib-Au NC). Fibrillation of BSA was carried out using available literature
studies by incubating the protein samples at 75 °C at pH 3.38 Fluorescence-based ThT assay was used for the
initial characterization of BSA fibrils. A significant enhancement
of ThT fluorescence intensity was observed for the BSA fibrils (λem of 485 nm for λex of 440 nm) (Figure 1a). The formation
of the fibrillar protein resulted in a 16% drop in the ellipticity
as judged by far-UV CD (Figure 1b). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements were subsequently
used to quantify the secondary structural components of BSA in its
native and fibril states. For the native BSA protein, four major absorption
bands corresponding to β-sheet (1631 cm–1),
α-helix (1651 cm–1), loops and turns (1663
cm–1), and β-turn (1683 cm–1) were considered. The native protein could be seen to be majorly
α-helical in nature (55% α-helix, 17% β-sheet) (Figure 1c), an estimation
supported by previous results and also by the crystal structure analysis
of BSA.39 When the protein was subjected
to fibrillation, some additional IR absorption bands were observed,
which corresponded to cross-β (1619 cm–1),
loops and turns (1692 cm–1), and antiparallel β-sheet
(1677 cm–1). To summarize, the fibrillation of BSA
was accompanied by a clear decrease in α-helical content (from
55% in the native state to 35% in the fibrillar state) and an increase
in beta sheet content (from 17% in the native state to 29% in the
fibrillar state) (Figure 1d). As compared to the FTIR spectrum of native BSA protein,
fibrillated BSA (Figure S1) showed intensity
reduction of the amide I and II bands. The CH2 in-plane
and out-of-plane bending bands were dominant, including 1442 and 991
cm–1, for BSA which became negligible when fibrillated.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Figures 2a–d and S2) confirmed protein self-assembly. The average height of BSA fibrils
was observed to be around 20 nm.

(1651 cm–1, from 55 to 35%) with a subsequent increase
in β-sheet (1632 cm–1, from 17 to 29%).

(2 μm × 2 μm scan) and shown as (c,d). (The side
bar is for references to color with respect to height). The height
vs distance profiles are also shown in the figure.

Subsequently, self-assembled BSA nanofibers thus
prepared was employed
as a template for the synthesis of fluorescent gold nanoclusters (Fib-Au
NCs) (Scheme 1). Primary
characterization of the nanocluster was carried out by studying optical
spectroscopy. The UV–vis absorption spectrum of the Fib-Au
NCs did not exhibit any characteristic surface plasmon band (Figure 3a, inset), indicating
that gold nanoparticles with core diameters larger than 2 nm did not
form.40 Instead, the strong fluorescence
emission was originated as expected from the gold nanoclusters. The
as-prepared Fib-Au NCs exhibited red fluorescence at λem = 675 nm when excited at 520 nm (Figure 3b). The fluorescence characteristic of gold
nanoclusters prepared by using native protein (BSA-Au NCs) was found
different from the fibril-stabilized nanoclusters. A significant 25
nm red shift in fluorescence emission maxima was observed for Fib-Au
NCs, compared to BSA-Au NCs (Figure 3c, Table 1). To the best of our knowledge, such protein self-association-induced
fluorescence enhancement along with bathochromic spectral shift is
observed for the first time. Increased beta sheet content was reported
to provide extra rigidity to overall protein structure.41 The increased beta-sheet percentage obtained
here may thus be responsible for the decrease in nonradiative decay
of Fib-Au NCs, resulting in the observed enhancement of fluorescence
intensity.42 Moreover, the aggregated BSA
template would also provide different electronic environments (difference
in charge density) surrounding NCs, which would further alter the
energy gap between the highest and lowest molecular orbitals, thereby
causing the red shift. This can be supported by our previous observation,
in which we showed using time-dependent density functional analysis
that different chemical environments surrounding a Cys residue in
a recombinant protein influence directly the Au–S bonding interaction.
It was complemented nicely by experimental emission maxima (HOMO–LUMO
energy gap).43

Spectral red shift is associated
with almost 40% increment in the
fluorescence intensity of Fib-Au NCs (Figure 3c). The measured relative quantum yield of
Fib-Au NCs was found to be 3.6%.

Analysis of the excitation
spectrum of Fib-Au NCs (λem = 675 nm) showed the
presence of two peaks positioned at
about ∼325 and ∼520 nm (Figure 2a). Excitation at 325 nm produced emission
maxima at 415 nm. It has been shown by ultrafast spectroscopy that
the emission band at 415 nm originates from the icosahedral Au13 core of the nanoclusters.44 In
contrast, the near-infrared emission around 700 nm is due to the passivating
monolayer involving a relaxation of the core excited states to S–Au–S–Au–S
semiring states. The presence of surface ligands can modulate the
fluorescence of metal NCs in two different ways: (i) charge transfer
from the ligands to the metal core via the Au–S bonds and (ii)
direct donation of delocalized electrons from electron-rich groups
of the ligands to the metal core.45

The size of the gold nanoclusters was further investigated by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 4). Bright-field TEM micrograph in Figure 4a,b represented size distributions
as well as lattice fringes of the nanoclusters synthesized within
BSA protein. Their size distributions resulted in an average diameter
of 1.7 (±0.3) nm. Almost a similar average diameter of 1.6 (±0.4)
nm was obtained for BSA fibril stabilized nanoclusters (Figure 4c,d). Accumulation of the gold
nanocluster on the protein fibril was clearly seen by TEM imaging
(Figure 4c). The high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image in Figure 4d revealed nanoclusters with lattice fringes, corresponding
to the (111) plane of gold nanoclusters.

NCs ((a,b) 1.7 ± 0.3 nm) and Fib-Au
NCs ((c,d) 1.6 ± 0.4 nm). Consecutive lines in the inset image
(yellow color in b and red color in d) show the planes (111).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was used to determine the
chemical and oxidation state of gold (Figure 5a) and sulfur atoms (Figure 5b) in Fib-Au NCs. The Au core level for Fib-Au
NCs showed distinct Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 components
at binding energies (BE) of 83.1 and 86.7 eV, respectively (Figure 5a, Table 1). In contrast, the reported
values of BE of the Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 levels
for BSA-Au NCs have been found to be at 84.01 and 87.81 eV, respectively.46 The binding energy shifts between Fib-Au NCs
and BSA-Au NCs may be related to differential effect of the protein
environments on the electronic state of the Au NCs.47 For sulfur, the peaks for BE of 2p3/2 at 161.7
and 167.2 eV (Figure 5b) can be attributed to the oxidized states of sulfur. The peak at
161.7 eV corresponded to the covalent interaction of gold nanoclusters
with the sulfur groups of the Cys residue of protein.48

Figure 5 XPS spectra of Fib-Au NCs, (a) 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 peaks show the formation of Au(0); (b) two peaks of S 2p3/2 confirm the presence of different oxidized states of sulfur.

The formation of BSA-Au NCs changes
overall helical content of
the protein (from 55% in native BSA to 48% in BSA-Au NCs) (Figures 1c and 6a, Table 1),
a result observed before by others.49 In
contrast, the extent of α-helix component in the Fib-Au NC sample
was found to increase slightly (37% as opposed to 35% in BSA fibrils)
(Figures 1 and 6b, Table 1). A sharp, moderately intense FTIR band was observed at ∼880
cm–1 for both BSA-Au NCs and Fib-Au NCs, which is
a key marker of tyrosine–tyrosine cross-linking.50 This cross-linking is a consequence of Au3+ ion reduction by tyrosine residues of the protein (Figure S3a,b). In addition, enhanced signals
of −COstr (1640–1690 cm–1, amide I region) and in plane NHbend (1510–1580
cm–1, amide II region) bands were observed for Fib-Au
NCs. The −CH2 bending band at 1442 cm–1 also became dominant (Figure S3b and Table S1) after Fib-Au NC formation. In contrast,
BSA-Au NCs showed significantly reduced signals for all the above
mentioned FTIR bands (Figure S3a and Table S1).

FT-IR spectra of Fib-Au NCs.

Variation of Synthesis Parameters
The synthesis parameters
were optimized for the best yield of the desired red emitting Fib-Au
NCs. Concentration of protein was varied between 5 and 50 mg/mL. A
significant decrease in fluorescence intensity of Fib-Au NCs was observed
when the protein concentration used was beyond 20 mg/mL (Figure 7a). Interestingly,
the change in fluorescence intensity was insignificant for the BSA-Au
NC for the entire range of concentrations (from 5 to 50 mg/mL).

the synthesis of Au25 by fibrils at different temperatures;
(c) time dependent growth of the nanoclusters; (d) stability of the
formed Au NCs over a period of a month.

The temperature effect on the synthesis of Au nanoclusters
within
BSA protein fibrils was also investigated, and optimum yield was observed
at 37 °C (Figure 7b). Synthesis of Fib-Au NCs was repeated at five different temperatures,
namely 8, 25, 37, 45, and 70 °C. The yield was insignificant
at a low (8 °C) and a high temperature (70 °C), whereas
comparable yields were obtained at 25, 37, and 45 °C. Subsequently,
the time dependence of nanocluster synthesis was investigated by measuring
the fluorescence intensity at 675 nm (λex of 520
nm) (Figure 7c). The
long term stability of the prepared Fib-Au NCs was also checked over
a period of 1 month (Figure 7d). When kept in aqueous solution at 4 °C for a month,
Fib-Au NCs were found stable with a ∼20% decrease in fluorescence.
However, the lyophilized powder of Fib-Au NCs can be kept at 4 °C
for as long as 1 year without any loss of fluorescence intensity,
which was checked by redissolving the powder in 20 mM sodium phosphate
buffer at pH 7.4 (Figure S4a). In addition,
Fib-Au NCs were found stable after one cycle of freeze-thawing (from
25 to −80 to 25 °C) (Figure S4b). Moreover, the zeta potential value of the Fib-Au NCs solution
was found to be −21.3 eV, indicating sufficient stability of
the amyloid-stabilized gold nanoclusters.

Application in the Detection
of Cys
Interestingly,
our as-prepared Fib-Au NCs exhibited selective fluorescence sensitivity
toward Cys detection. It was found that the fluorescence intensity
(λem = 675 nm) of Fib-Au NCs was sufficiently quenched
by the gradual addition of Cys (Figure 8a,b). Hcy and glutathione (GSH) are the most common
analytes, which interfere with Cys detection. Thus, for the sensing
studies, a series of aqueous solutions of different analytes (all
amino acids, Hcy, GSH) were used and their concentration was initially
kept at 500 nM, which was gradually increased up to 2 mM keeping all
other experimental conditions identical. The addition of Cys to Fib-Au
NCs results in a large fluorescence quenching (Figure 8b). Other analytes did not show significant
quenching, confirming the specificity of Fib-Au NCs. Furthermore,
the detection ability of Fib-Au NCs follows the following order: Cys
≫ Hcy > GSH > other amino acids. The limit of detection
(LOD)
for the Cys sensing was found to be 76 × 10–9 M (76 nM) (linear range 76 nM to 300 μM). The concentration
level of Cys in blood plasma of a healthy person typically ranges
from 240 to 360 μM and normal content of Cys ranges from 30
to 200 μM in cells. Thus, Fib-Au NCs can be considered as sensitive
enough for analysis of Cys in real biological samples.

respectively; (b) emission spectra of Au NCs in the presence of increasing

intensity of Fib-Au NCs vs of Cys concentration (symbols) and the
corresponding linear regression (line); (d) modified Stern–Volmer
plot and the corresponding linear regression; (e) effect of pH on
the ΔF of the Au NCs-Cys system.

For unraveling the possible mechanistic pathways
of the interaction
of Au NCs with Cys molecules, Stern–Volmer analysis has been
carried out. From the Stern–Volmer data, it is evident that
the interaction is very strong and spontaneous. Stern–Volmer’s
equation (eq 1) can describe
the quenching of the Fib-Au NCs as 1  where F0 and F are the
fluorescence intensities of the Fib-Au NCs in
the absence and in the presence of a quencher (Cys), respectively,
and [Q] is the concentration of the quencher (Cys). The value of Ksv is found to be 1.09 × 104 M–1. The straight line observed in Figure 8c suggested primarily static
quenching of Fib-Au NC by Cys, which occurs due to their complex formation
driven by the thiol group. Furthermore, we had estimated the binding
constant (K = 67.72 M–1) and number
of binding sites (n = 0.47) of the Cys molecules
on the surface of Fib-Au NCs using a modified version of the Stern–Volmer
equation (eq 2) 2  

The associated thermodynamics
of binding can also be estimated
by measuring the free energy of binding (ΔGbinding) given by eq 3: 3  

ΔGbinding was found to be
−2.512
kcal mol–1. Next, we investigated the effects of
pH on the ΔF(F0 – F) for the detection of Cys. As is observed
from Figures 8e and S5, the ΔF decreased in
the range of pH 3–6. Within pH range 6–8, the value
of ΔF remained similar but with further increase
in the pH up to pH 11 again showed increase in the ΔF of the system (Figure S5).
The quenching experiment was repeated with BSA-Au NCs also to compare
the sensitivity between Fib-Au NC and BSA-Au NC. Fluorescence intensity
of BSA-Au NCs also decreased as a result of increasing Cys concentrations
(Figure S6). BSA-Au NCs showed less binding
(K of 33.8 M–1) compared to Fib-Au
NCs (K of 67.72 M–1). In addition,
the LOD value was also found high for BSA-Au NCs (50 μM) when
compared to Fib-Au NCs (76 nM).

In this context, it is important
to compare the sensitivity and
specificity of Fib-Au NCs with previously reported literature. The
present LOD value is significantly low when compared to several fluorescence-based
small molecule sensors.51,52 In addition, the LOD
of Fib-Au NCs was found less than a number of composite nanoparticle-based
sensors of Cys’s.53,54 Comparable LOD in the
range of nM was observed with several other reports.55,56

MTT Assay and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting
It
is also important to understand the nanocluster effect on cellular
viability prior to propose them as a convenient candidate for in-cell
studies. Therefore, MTT assay was conducted with HeLa cells to evaluate
the effects of Fib-Au NCs on cell viability over a broad range of
concentrations, ranging from 500 nM to 1600 μM. The cellular
viability assay reflected over 98% cell viability when the cluster
concentration was kept at 500 nM. At concentrations of 50 and 100
μM, the viability of cells was observed to be 90%. The viability
assay data indicated negligible clusters induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity
(Figure 9a). To have
a direct quantification of Fib-Au NC permeation, flow cytometry by
FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) was performed. Flow cytometry
results confirmed a significant uptaking of Fib-Au NCs at a concentration
of 50 and 100 μM (as compared to 25 μM) within a time
frame of 20 min (Figure 9b). To probe into the mechanisms, which lead to a loss of viability
of cells, we resorted to flow cytometry-based investigations. The
study was done to unveil if the cell viability is getting affected
by apoptosis or if they are treading the necrotic pathway. This stands
significant, as death by the necrotic mechanism is highly toxic for
cells in the immediate vicinity. On the contrary, apoptosis is programmed
internal machinery, whereby the cell organelles are packaged in vesicular
structures and there is no spillage of lytic proteins in the vicinity.
Interestingly, our flow cytometry results revealed early apoptotic
rates of 8 and 10% when treated by 50 and 100 μM, respectively
(Figure 9c,d). Thus,
correlating all the above mentioned findings, it can be inferred that
at the concentration of 50 μM and a treatment time frame of
20 min Fib-Au NCs can be effectively used for bioimaging purposed
with no observable cell damage.

sets with 50 and 100 μM Fib-Au NCs; (e) plot showing real time
gene expression levels of apoptotic genes on incubation with Fib-Au
NCs.

Real-time PCR Analysis
Novel compounds on cytosolic
permeation may induce epigenetic changes. To probe any probable epigenetic
modulation on apoptotic cascade, which in turn may affect cell health
and viability we scored Bcl2 Bax expression by real-time
PCR. Treatment of the HeLa cells showed ∼3 fold increase in
the gene expression of the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl2 and a concomitant decrease in the expression of the pro-apoptotic
marker Bax by ∼3 folds (Figure 9e). This observation complies with our flow
cytometry results, which revealed a very negligible apoptotic population
and a vast majority of viable cells. The real-time PCR data suggest
that the Fib-Au NC does not induce any epigenetic effect on the apoptotic
propensity of the cells. On the contrary, its permeation orchestrates
the expression of the anti-apoptotic factor, further inhibiting the
apoptotic propensity.

Detection of Exogenous Cys in Live Cells
Prior to imaging
exogenous Cys, we first assured intracellular uptaking of Fib-Au NCs
within cell cytosol. Live cell confocal imaging revealed significant
extent of Fib-Au NC permeation upon treatment of HeLa cells with 50
μM of Fib-Au NCs for 20 min. The permeation stands out evident
with respect to the control set as postpermeation bright fluorescence
was observed after an excitation at 488 nm (Figure 10a,b). As quantified from pixel distributions
and 3D interactive surface plots of Image J ensemble, the cells with
Fib-Au NCs showed an average fluorescence intensity of 25 units (arb
unit) (Figure 10c).
The postpermeation residence of Fib-Au NCs inside the cell does not
result in cell stress. Fib-Au NCs were observed in the cell cytosol
with no marked alteration on the cell shape.

To image exogenous Cys, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)
precultured HeLa cells were taken because NEM can efficiently block
intracellular sulfhydryl compounds.57 These
NEM precultured HeLa cells were first treated with same Fib-Au NCs
and the NCs showed their own bright red fluorescence (excitation at
488 nm) after uptaking. However, further treatment of NEM precultured
HeLa cells with exogenous Cys causes significant quenching of the
nanocluster fluorescence (Figure 11a–d).

Conclusions
A
simple and green approach for the synthesis of the intensely
red-emitting BSA fibril-directed Au NCs has been presented in this
manuscript. The highly water-soluble clusters possess excellent stability
for more than 1 month. The Fib-Au NC has been subsequently used as
a sensitive and selective probe for the label-free, sensitive, and
selective detection of Cys (LOD = 76 nM) even in the presence of Hcy
or GSH, which often interferes in its detection. The as-prepared Fib-Au
NC is also an efficient candidate for imaging exogenous Cys within
live cells. The nanomaterial itself exhibits excellent photostability
and appreciable biocompatibility within cell cytosol. The red fluorescence
emitting Fib-Au NCs also show excellent localization and distribution
in the cytoplasm with the significant fraction entering into the nucleus
of HeLa cells. As a concluding remark, we are proposing this Fib-Au
NC as a potential nanoprobe for Cys sensing along with bioimaging
property.

Experimental Procedure
Materials
Auric chloride (HAuCl4) was obtained
from Spectrochem (India). BSA and NaOH pellets were obtained from
Amresco, Ohio, U.S. Sodium chloride, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium
phosphate dibasic, glutathione, Hcy, and the amino acids [l-alanine (C3H7NO2), l-arginine
(C6H14N4O2), l-asparagine monohydrate (C4H8N2O3), l-aspartic acid (C4H7NO4), l-Cys (C3H7NO2S), l-glutamic acid (C5H9NO4), l-glutamine (C5H10N2O3), l-glycine (C2H5NO2), l-histidine (C6H9N3O2), l-isoleucine (C6H13NO2), l-leucine (C6H13NO2), l-lysine (C6H14N2O2), l-methionine (C5H11NO2S), l-phenylalanine (C9H11NO2), l-proline (C5H9NO2), l-serine (C3H7NO3), l-threonine (C4H9NO3), l-tryptophan (C11H12N2O2), l-tyrosine (C9H11NO3), and l-valine (C5H11NO2)] were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and used without
any further purification. The fluorescent probe thioflavin T (ThT)
was also obtained from Sigma. All the buffer solutions were prepared
using millipore water. The buffer was prepared freshly prior to every
experiment. Filters (0.22 μm) were supplied from Millipore (Ireland).

Synthesis of the BSA Fibrils and Fibril-Assisted Fluorescent
Gold Nanoclusters
The synthesis of BSA fibrils was done according
to the earlier reported methods with slight modifications.38 All the glassware were thoroughly cleaned before
use with freshly prepared aqua regia, rinsed with methanol and ultrapure
H2O, and then dried in an oven at ∼100 °C for
1–2 h. In the first step of synthesis, BSA fibrils were produced
by dissolving BSA (concentration varying from 1 to 50 mg/mL) in phosphate
buffer in a round bottom flask and were incubated at a specified temperature
(60–75 °C)38 in a water bath
without agitation for 100 h. In the next step, 500 μL of aqueous
HAuCl4 solution (10 mM) was added within previously prepared
BSA fibril solution and stirred vigorously at 37 °C. About 5
min later, 1 M aqueous solution of NaOH was added dropwise so that
the solution would reach pH 12. After that, the reaction was kept
in incubation at 37 °C under constant stirring for 24 h. The
color of the solution changed to deep red. The resultant BSA fibril
encapsulated Au NC solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter,
lyophilized, and stored in refrigerator at 4 °C for further use.

Characterizations of the Au NCs
BSA fibrils were primarily
characterized by AFM using a Pico Plus 5500 AFM system (Agilent Technologies,
USA) in AAC mode. Images were processed by flattening using PicoView
software (Agilent Technologies, USA) and the width of protein fibrils
were measured manually.

A thermoscientific UV-10 spectrometer
was used for UV–visible absorption spectroscopy measurements.
Absorbance scans (200–750 nm) were taken using a quartz cuvette
of 1 cm path length. All fluorescence measurements were made using
a PTI fluorescence spectrometer. The emission spectra were recorded
after excitation at 520 nm. The slits were set at 5 nm for both excitation
and emission. All measurements were done repeatedly to obtain reproducible
results.

A JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope was
used for
obtained TEM images. The sample was placed on a carbon-coated Cu grid
and analyzed. Far-UV CD (between 190 and 250 nm) spectra of the samples
were recorded using a cuvette of 1 mm path length in a JASCO J720
spectropolarimeter. The concentration of protein was kept at 10 μM.58 The bandwidth was set at 1 nm. Five CD spectra
were taken and then averaged for each sample.

FT-IR spectra
were taken using a Bruker 600 series FT-IR spectrometer.
The deconvolution of raw FT-IR spectra from 1700 to 1600 cm–1 (belonging to amide I region) was done by fitting the curves to
Gaussian line shapes. Then, the peaks were assigned to components
associated with different secondary structures according to previous
reports.59,60 XPS measurements were done using Omicron
Nanotechnology instrument. The ζ-potential was measured using
Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Instruments, U.K.) at 25 °C.

Cys Detection
Assay
All the analytes (all amino acids,
Hcy, GSH) were taken and a 5 mM stock solution for each of them was
prepared. Then, the analyte solutions were gradually added to the
nanoclusters and the consequent change in fluorescence intensity was
monitored. Effect of pH on nanocluster mediated Cys sensing was
further monitored.

Cytotoxicity (MTT) Assay
For estimating
the optimal
concentration of Fib-Au NCs for in-cell studies, MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was done. The assay primarily
measures the proliferation rate of the cells. Only the viable cells
reduce MTT into formazan crystals making use of mitochondrial dehydrogenase
enzyme. Human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells were seeded in 96-well
plates keeping an optimal count of around 103 viable cells
per well. The cells were incubated for 1 day. The viability assay
was performed by incubating the cells with a series of Fib-Au NCs
concentrations, ranging from 500 nM to 1600 μM. After 20 min
of treatment of cells with Fib-Au NCs, the media was replaced with
the MTT containing media (1 mg/mL). The cells were thereafter incubated
for a time frame of 4 h at an ambient temperature of 37 °C. The
medium was finally removed and the cells were diluted in 100 μL
of 0.04 N HCl/isopropyl alcohol. The relative formazan formation in
each well was monitored by determination of absorbance at 540 nm in
a microplate reader (MultiSkan, Thermo Scientific, USA). The resulting
absorbance values were converted to percentage viability with respect
to the untreated control cells.

Permeation Extent Analysis
by Flow Cytometry
Au NC
cellular permeation was also assessed by resorting to flow cytometry
(FACS). A density of 107 cells was followed for FACS measurements.
As the MTT assay showed above 90 percent viability of cells at Au
NC concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 μM, we restricted FACS measurements
to only these concentrations of Au NCs. Treatment was made for 20
min and the incubation was carried out at 37 °C. FACS was carried
out in BD FACS Diva. For all FACS-based permeation measurements, 405
nm line was used for excitation from a 15 mW argon ion laser and the
blue fluorescence channel (FL1).

Apoptosis Analysis by Flow
Cytometry
The probable apoptotic
events of HeLa cells upon Au NC uptake were probed by using the Annexin
V-FITC apoptosis detection kit. The 12-well plates were used to seed
HeLa cells at a density of 107 cells. After washing with
phosphate buffer saline, the cells were resuspended in 500 μL
of binding buffer. Thereafter, 5 μL of Annexin V-FITC followed
5 μL of propidium iodide were added to each of the centrifuge
tube followed by thorough mixing so as to scour for necrotic cell
population. Incubation in the dark for 10 min was done before the
analysis with BD FACS Diva (Gallios flow cytometer, Beckman-Coulter).61 The estimations were made with respect to control
untreated cell sets.

RNA Isolation and Quantitative PCR
For quantitative
PCR, the total cellular RNA was extracted using Tripure reagent (Sigma).
During the extraction, standard methods described in the kit protocol
were followed. Using iScript reverse transcriptase (Bio-Rad) and referring
to manufacturer’s instructions, cDNA was synthesized. qPCR
was carried out in a 7500 fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems)
using SYBR reagent (Bio-Rad). In brief, 1 μg of RNA was reverse
transcribed followed by qPCR. The reaction conditions followed were
primary denaturation step (95 °C for 5 min) and cycling step
(denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at a specific temperature
for each set of primers for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 30 s
repeated for 35 cycles), followed by melting curve analysis (45–90
°C). In the experimental exhibit, 18s rRNA as the endogenous
control was used. The relative fold change was measured and has been
shown with representative bar diagram. The experiment was repeated
three times and the values represent mean ± S.E.M. (*p < 0.005).

Cell Imaging Study
For live cell
experiments, cervical
cancer cell line (HeLa) was used and the cells were grown and maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fatal bovine serum, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate,
4 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.
Incubation was made in humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For imaging, the seeding was done in a 35 mm poly-d-lysine coated plate (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA). The
cells were allowed to grow ∼75% confluency is reached. Thereafter,
these cells were treated with Fib-Au NC solution at a stock concentration
of 1 mM, incubated for 20 min in humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and subjected for imaging. For the control
experimental set, the cells were cultured with NEM (500 μM).

The time frame followed was 30 min with an ambient temperature
of 37 °C to remove the intracellular biothiols. After thorough
and gentle washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, the
cells were thereafter incubated with 1 μM of Fib-Au NCs for
30 min at 37 °C. Instant confocal imaging was performed thereafter.
For the confocal imaging of exogenous Cys-treated cells, HeLa cells
were initially pretreated with NEM (500 μM) for a time frame
of 30 min at 37 °C. They were washed with PBS and then treated
with probe compound (1 μM) for a time frame of 30 min at 37
°C. Finally, the resulting HeLa cells were incubated with Cys
(50 μM) for 30 min at 37 °C. The imaging of cells was then
carried out after washing with PBS buffer.

Imaging experiments
were carried out using a Zeiss 510 META Confocor3
LSM set up (Carl Zeiss, Evotech, Jena, Germany) equipped with C-Apochromat
40X (NA = 1.20, water immersion) objective and confocal images were
acquired with 512 × 512 pixel (pinhole aperture ≈ 1 airy
units). The nanocluster was excited using a diode laser at 488 nm.

With an objective to gain a quantitative insight into the Fib-Au
NCs permeation within cell cytoplasm, we used Java based image analysis
bundle of Image J. Spots showing fluorescence were randomly selected
for obtaining a preliminary insight of Fib-Au NC permeation. The pixel
densities of these spots were compared with respect to the control
set where no treatment was made and hence not showing any fluorescence.
Furthermore, a surface plot analysis output was obtained resorting
to the Surface Plot plugin of Image J. The average post uptake fluorescence
intensity after excitation at 405 nm was found to range from 12 to
16 arb unit. The height for the plot represents the luminance of each
pixel which constitutes the image. The 3D visualization resorts to
JRenderer3D plugin. The final rendition offers a quantitatively precise
postuptake residence rate of the Fib-Au NC.
