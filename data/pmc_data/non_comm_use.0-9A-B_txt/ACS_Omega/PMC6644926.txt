Room-temperature stable macroporous
mayenite electride (C12A7:e–) has been successfully
prepared via a sol–gel
method accompanied by phase separation, followed by heat-treatment
and reduction processes. The obtained xerogel monoliths possess controllable
macrostructure and a porosity of more than 60%, depending on adjusting
the amount of poly(ethylene oxide) as a phase separation inducer.
Heat-treatment allows the formation of multicrystals Ca12Al14O32Cl2 and Ca12Al14O33 (C12A7), and the porosity increases to 78.67%
after being heat-treated at 1100 °C. Further reduction promotes
the transformation from Ca12Al14O32Cl2 or C12A7 to C12A7:e– as well as
the conversion from an insulator to a semiconductive electride. The
carrier concentration of the electride reaches 3.029 × 1018 cm–3 after being reduced at 1100 °C
under Ar atmosphere, and the porosity still remains 66%. The macrostructure
of the resultant mayenite electride before and after heat-treatment
and reduction is perfectly preserved, indicating that the obtained
macroporous monolithic mayenite electride could be utilized in the
electronic components.

Introduction
An electride, in which
the electrons act as anions in the compounds,
is a kind of a special crystalline ionic material.1 In 1990, two kinds of electrides (Cs+ (18-crown-6)2e– and K+ (crytand[2.2.2])e–) have been synthesized by James L. Dye.2 Different from the metals, the electrons in electrides are usually
not absolutely delocalized and cannot be thought of as a “sea
of electrons”.3−6 At present, the inefficient control over the consistence of the
electron anions and the low thermal stability are the main limitations
of the electrides required to improve. Mayenite (Ca12Al14O33, that is, 12CaO·7Al2O3, C12A7), a complex binary oxide material, can be converted
to a novel electride from an insulator because of its stable structure
in room-temperature and high carrier concentration. The unique properties
of C12A7 come from its special “cage” structure with
inner diameters of approximately 0.5 nm. Two extra O2– ions (generally known as free oxygen ions) a take over 2 out of
12 cages in a unit-cell. The C12A7 can be reduced so that part of
the free oxygen ions can be substituted by the equivalent number of
extra framework electrons,7 which makes
C12A7 a room-temperature stable electride.

C12A7 was first found
in the cement in 19368 and after some years,
the space group of C12A7 has been announced
through the analysis of its single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD)
data that its space group was finally stated9 and further verified by neutron powder diffraction data.10 The fabrication of the first inorganic electride
stable at room-temperature in air was reported by Matsuishi et al.,
and they confirmed the electride form of C12A7 with electron paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopy.7 Kim et al. reported
two additional synthetic methods more simply and directly adapted
for large scale preparation of a kind of polycrystalline C12A7 electride
through the concretion of the stoichiometric C12A7 melt under a reducing
atmosphere.11−13 Matsuishi et al. also introduced a direct synthesis
method for the fabrication of C12A7 electride powder.14 Rand et al. described the efforts to fabricate and test
a hollow cathode that utilizes C12A7 electride as a thermionic emission
surface.

Up to now, a number of techniques have been utilized
for the fabrication
of C12A7 materials.15−24 However, there have been few reports about porous C12A7 with interconnected
macropores and co-continuous skeletons, except for our previous work.25 The space of the macropores allows the chemical
reactions to act thoroughly and reduces the resistance of the liquid
flow. Such a stable conductive material with macropores inside can
be applied to a series of areas, such as a porous electrode, the carrier
of catalyst for some electrochemical reaction, and so on.

In
this work, we report the preparation of macroporous monolithic
mayenite electride via the sol–gel method accompanied by phase
separation, followed by heat-treatment and further reduction. During
reduction, the free oxygen ions in the special cage structure of mayenite
are replaced by electrons to obtain special room-temperature stable
mayenite electrides (C12A7:e–). The macrostructure
formation, heat-treatment, and reduction of the resultant macroporous
monolithic mayenite electrides are investigated in detail. The crystal
structures of the C12A7 before and after reduction are also calculated
by the CAmbride Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code.

Results
and Discussion
In our approach, the calcium chloride dihydrate
(CaCl2·2H2O) and aluminum chloride hexahydrate
(AlCl3·6H2O) were used as ionic precursors,
and
a chelating agent glycol (EG) was used to restrain the precipitation
of Ca2+ ions. The poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) promotes the
phase separation of the system, and the propylene oxide (PO) accelerates
the sol–gel transition so that the macrostructure will be frozen
during phase separation. The shrinkage and crack of gels during drying
can be prevented through the addition of formamide to reduce the capillary
pressure during drying. A schematic diagram of the sol–gel
process accompanied by phase separation of the Ca–Al–O
system has been shown in Figure S1. Figure 1 depicts the appearance
of morphologies of dried gel synthesis with different WPEO. All of the dried gel samples exhibit a 3D network
structure, in which both co-continuous skeletons and interconnected
macropores simultaneously exist in the macrostructure. With the increase
of WPEO, the 3D network structure does
not change a lot before the WPEO reaches
0.24 g, whereas the macropore size of the as-dried samples decreases
obviously. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the mayenite
samples in different magnifications for sample B has been shown in Figure S2. When 0.24 g of PEO is added, the particle
aggregates will be obtained due to too much phase separation. Through
this method, a kind of macroporous material with adjustable macropore
size can be obtained simply.

Figure 1 SEM images of dried gels prepared with various WPEO: (A) 0.06 g of PEO, (B) 0.12 g of PEO, (C)
0.18 g
of PEO, and (D) 0.24 g of PEO.

Figure 2 shows
the
macropore size distribution of dried gels with different WPEO, using mercury porosimetry. It is easily observed
that three xerogels have a narrow macropore size distribution, indicating
macroscale phase separation that falls in the spinodal decomposition
region. The macropore size of the three xerogels is distributed between
0.7 and 1.1 μm, enabling the application of the porous monolith
for many purposes that require different pore sizes. The median macropore
sizes of xerogels with WPEO = 0.06, 0.12,
and 0.18 g are 1.4, 1.1, and 0.85 μm, and the porosities are
75.35, 68.52, and 61.85% respectively, reflecting that the macropore
size of the dried gels becomes smaller with the increase of WPEO. The results are well in accordance with
the SEM morphology.

Figure 2 Macropore sizes distribution of dried gels prepared with
various WPEO values: (a) 0.06 g of PEO,
(b) 0.12 g of
PEO, and (c) 0.18 g of PEO.

Thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry
(TG–DSC)
curves for gels are depicted in Figure 3. TG curve shows a total mass loss of 68.5 wt % from
room-temperature to 1100 °C. A large endothermic peak at around
100 °C and a weight loss as high as 20 wt % at 20–120
°C can be attributed to the evaporation of water and organic
solvents, which also indicates that the resultant monolith has a high
water-absorbing capacity. A little exothermic peak at 200 °C
is related to the pyrolysis of organic species, such as residual PEO
and halogenated alcohol, generated by the irreversible ring-opening
reaction of protonated propylene oxide. The endothermic peak at 300
°C can be ascribed to the dehydroxylation of the calcium chloride
precursor. A little exothermal peak near 400 °C is caused by
decomposition of γ-AlOOH. The broad exothermic peak at around
500 °C is owing to the phase transformation from γ-AlOOH
to γ-Al2O3 and decomposition of a little
amount of residues. It can be observed that the transformation of
nonequilibrium CaO and γ-Al2O3 to equilibrium
C12A7 containing Cl takes place above 950 °C.

Figure 3 TG–DSC curves
of the dried gel sample.

The as-dried sample with 0.12 g of PEO was chosen to carry
out
the heat-treatment and reduction in the subsequent steps. Figure 4 depicts the appearance
of the typical monolith (Figure 4A) and the morphologies of monoliths heat-treated at
different temperatures. After heat-treatment, the appearance and structure
of as-prepared porous monolith can be preserved perfectly with a little
shrinkage, whereas the surface of the skeletons has become dense and
smooth due to the removal of the residual organic matter during the
process of the heat-treatment.

Figure 4 Appearance of the typical monolith (A)
and SEM images of samples
heat-treated at various temperatures: (B) 700 °C, (C) 900 °C,
and (D) 1100 °C.

Similar to the dried gel sample, all of the samples heat-treated
at different temperatures exhibit relative narrow macropore size distribution,
which can be seen in Figure 5. The median macropore size and porosity of gels after being
heat-treated at 700, 900, and 1100 °C are 0.7, 0.7, and 0.5 μm
and 76.74, 76.97, and 78.67%, respectively. Compared with the dried
sample, the macropore size of the heat-treated samples decreases,
whereas the porosity increases. The sample heat-treated at 1100 °C
shows a porosity as high as 78.67%. The decrease of the pore size
is caused by the shrinkage of the network, and the increase of porosity
can be ascribed to the thermal decomposition of organic compositions
in the skeletons. There is almost no mesopore in the skeleton of the
C12A7 samples, which can be proved from the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms of the mayenite samples (Figure S3).

Figure 5 Macropore size distribution of dried gels after being heat-treated
at various temperatures: (a) 700 °C, (b) 900 °C, and (c)
1100 °C.

XRD patterns of samples
after being heat-treated at different temperatures
are shown in Figure 6. No specific peaks are observed for the dried gel, indicating the
amorphous structure. By comparing the XRD patterns with the standard
data of Ca12Al14O33 (C12A7) (PDF-09-0413
card) and Ca12Al14O32Cl2 (PDF-45-0568 card), it is seen that the XRD diffraction peaks of
the samples heat-treated at different temperatures are in accordance
with those of Ca12Al14O32Cl2 due to the utilization of the chloride precursors. A part of free
oxygen ions in cages is replaced by the chlorine ions during heat-treatment,
but the replacement has little influence on the reduction of the C12A7
due to much less electronegativity of the Cl– ions
than that of the O2– ions. The result indicates
that the C12A7 material has a cubic structure with a unit-cell content
of Ca24Al28O68 and the I43̅d space group. No other phases, such as
CaAl2O4 (CA) or Ca5Al6O14 (C5A3), are observed.

Figure 6 XRD patterns of the sample after being
dried and heat-treated at
different temperatures.

Figure 7 shows
the
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and scattering light
spot of the sample after being heat-treated at 1100 °C. The multicrystals
and grain boundary in the sample can be clearly observed, which indicates
that the amorphous structure converts to the multicrystals but not
single crystals. Combined with the XRD patterns (Figure 6), it is supposed that after
heat-treatment, most of the amorphous structure transforms to Ca12Al14O32Cl2 whereas some
of it may convert to Ca12Al14O33 and
the multicrystals Ca12Al14O32Cl2 and Ca12Al14O33 will be
obtained after heat-treatment.

Figure 7 TEM image and scattering light spot of
the C12A7 sample after being
heat-treated at 1100 °C.

Figure 8A
exhibits
the SEM image of the heat-treated sample after being further reduced
at 900 °C. After reduction, the appearance and structure of the
as-prepared porous mayenite monolith can still be largely preserved
with the further shrinkage and collapse of skeletons of the macropores
in some area. Although the structure of the reduction sample is a
little broken compared to that of the as-dried and heat-treatment
samples, the reduction has little influence on the co-continuous skeletons
and interconnected macropores.

Figure 8 SEM image (A) and macropore size distribution
(B) of the sample
reduced at 900 °C.

The macropore size distribution of the reduced sample is
shown
in Figure 8B. It is
obviously seen that the sample, after reduction, has a relative wide
macropore size distribution with a median pore size of about 0.6 μm.
Although the macropore size distribution of the reduced samples is
similar to that of the heat-treated samples, the porosity of the reduced
sample slightly falls to 66.35%, resulting from the partial collapse
of the C12A7 during the reduction.

Figure 9 shows the
XRD patterns of the samples reduced at different temperatures. After
reduction, whether there exists the Ca12Al14O33 phase or not is uncertain judging from the XRD patterns
due to the same peaks of Ca12Al14O32Cl2 and Ca12Al14O33 except
the intensity of the 211 peak. Obviously, compared with the heat-treated
samples, there has been almost no change in peak positions after reduction
but the 211 peak of the reduced samples is much higher than the one
before reduction, which is closer to the C12A7 phase without chlorine
elements.26 With the increase of the reduction
temperature, the 211 peak rises obviously. It indicates that the cage
structure has been reserved, the O2– ions as well
as Cl– ions in the cage structure have been replaced
by the e– successfully, and the reduction reaction
and the replacement reaction have been  carried out more thoroughly
with the increase of the reduction temperature. The results confirm
that the C12A7:e– forms and mayenite electride is
obtained after reduction at high temperature.

Figure 9 XRD patterns of the samples
reduced at different temperatures.

The carrier concentration of macroporous mayenite electride
after
being reduced at different temperatures has been listed in Figure 10. The samples before
reduction are absolutely insulating, which cannot be tested through the
Hall effect. It is observed that the carrier concentration increases
with the rise of the reduction temperature. A low carrier concentration
of 1.119 × 106 cm–3 is obtained
at 500 °C, whereas a high reduction temperature of 1100 °C
results in a high carrier concentration of 3.029 × 1018 cm–3. It confirms that the carrier concentration
of the macroporous mayenite electride is closely related to the reduction
temperature. Though, the Cl– ions are placed in
a loose cage structure, the reduction reaction still needs a certain
amount of energy to damage the covalent bond due to the strong electronegativity
of the Cl– ions. A higher reduction temperature
may promote the reduction reaction, which leads to a higher conversion
percentage of the C12A7. The carrier concentration can be reserved
perfectly even after heat-treatment at 400 °C in air environment.

Figure 10 Carrier
concentration of C12A7:e– reduced at
different temperatures.

Figure 11 shows
the TEM image of the sample and scattering light spot after being
reduced at 900 °C. Compared with the heat-treated sample (Figure 7), it is clearly
found that the multicrystals convert to complete the single crystal
and the single crystal is C12A7:e– according to
the XRD patterns (Figure 9). It further confirms that both Ca12Al14O32Cl2 and Ca12Al14O33 have been reduced to C12A7:e– after reduction.

Figure 11 TEM
image and scattering light spot of the C12A7 reduced at 900
°C.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of the dried, heat-treated,
and reduced samples are shown in Figure 12. It is found that the formamide (FA) and
EG are distributed in the dried sample, whose main bands are as follows:
stretching vibration of C–O groups (1692 cm–1), bending vibration of C–H bonds (880 cm–1), and stretching vibration of C–C bonds (1078 cm–1). After heat-treatment, all of the organic groups have been removed.
The peaks at 572, 653, and 692 cm–1 are due to the
Al–O stretching vibrations, and the peak at 1402 cm–1 is assigned to the Al–O verticle vibration. The peaks at
about 300–400 cm–1 are attributed to the
Ca2+ from the system. The peaks at 3417 and 1625 cm–1 correspond to the stretching vibrations and plane
bending vibrations of O–H bending vibrations of water, respectively.
There is almost no difference from spectra of heat-treated and reduced
samples, which means that the component and structure of mayenite
change a little after reduction. The weakness of bond strength of
Al–O after reduction may be caused by the removal of the Cl– and O2– ions, which weakens the
bond of the electrons around the “cages” and increases
the electrons excited by the infrared ray. It also indicates that
the reduction of the mayenite has little influence of the cage structure,
which results in that there is almost no chemical bond broken during
reduction.

Figure 12 FT-IR spectra of the samples after being dried and heat-treated
at 1100 °C and reduced at 900 °C.

The Raman spectra of as-dried, heat-treated, and reduced
samples
are shown in Figure 13. It is seen that there are some Raman peaks in the as-dried sample,
indicating numerous organic matters. These peaks can be removed after
heat-treatment and reduction, and the main Raman peaks at 570, 770,
and 1075 cm–1 occur, which are attributed to Al–O
bond. The relative intensity of these three peaks is different, resulting
from the change of the Al–O bond due to the removal of the
O2– ions or Cl– ions.

Figure 13 Raman spectra
of the samples after being dried and heat-treated
at 1100 °C and reduced at 900 °C.

Figure 14A shows
the crystal structure of the C12A7. The cage space is occupied by
the O2– or Cl– ions, and both
ions have a strong electronegativity and easily form a covalent bond
with other ions in the crystal. The process of the reduction is shown
in Figure 14B; the
reducing agent CaH2 could react with C12A7 through contact
with C12A7 at high temperature and in vacuum environment. The loss
of the O2– and Cl– ions releases
the electrons bonded by the covalent bond and transforms to free electrons
(shown in Figure 14C), which is similar to the n-type doped semiconductor.

Figure 14 (A) Crystal
structure of the C12A7, (B) schematic diagram of the
reduction principle and (C) crystal structure of the C12A7:e–, and (D) density of states (DOS’s) of C12A7.

Figure 14D shows
the CASTEP DOS predictions for a single cell of C12A7 before and after
reduction. From the DOS shown in Figure 14D, the Fermi level of C12A7 before reduction
is just placed in the gap, which reveals that the C12A7 is an intrinsic
semiconductor. Also, n-type conduction can be observed in C12A7 after
reduction from Figure 14D, in which the Fermi level has just crossed the bottom of the conduction
band. However, the DOS value near the Fermi level is not so high,
declaring the limited conductive ability of the C12A7 after reduction.
The calculated results are consistent with the results of the carrier
concentration (Figure 10).

Conclusions
In summary, a kind of inorganic and room-temperature
stable monolithic
mayenite electride (C12A7:e–) with co-continued
skeletons and interconnected macropores has been successfully prepared
via a sol–gel method accompanied by phase separation, followed
by heat-treatment and a reduction process. An appropriate amount of
PEO is utilized to form the macrostructure with adjustable macropore
size and high porosity. The multicrystals Ca12Al14O32Cl2 and Ca12Al14O33 (C12A7) precipitate after heat-treatment and transform to
single-phase C12A7:e– after reduction. The carrier
concentration of mayenite electride (C12A7:e–) increases
with the reduction temperature and reaches 3.029 × 1018 cm–3 when the reduction temperature rises to 1100
°C. Heat-treatment and reduction do not spoil the macrostructure
of monolithic mayenite with high porosity. Such macroporous electron-encaged
materials can be applied to different fields, such as electron emission,
reducing agents, optoelectronic devices, oxygen-ion generation, and
so on.

Experimental Section
Materials
Calcium chloride dihydrate
(CaCl2·2H2O, Sigma-Aldrich Co., 99%) and
aluminum chloride
hexahydrate (AlCl3·6H2O, Sigma-Aldrich
Co., 99%) were used as calcium source and aluminum source, respectively.
A mixture of distilled water and ethanol (C2H6O: Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, AR) was used as the solvent.
Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO: Aladdin Co., AR) with an average molecular
weight (Mw) of 300 000 and propylene
oxide (PO: Sigma-Aldrich Co., 99.5%) were added as the phase separation
inducer and gelation agent, respectively. Glycol (EG: Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd, AR) and formamide (FA: Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd, AR) were utilized as the chelating agent and drying control
chemical additive, respectively. CaH2 was used as a reductant
to reduce the sample. All reagents were used as received without further
purification.

Synthesis
The starting compositions
are listed in Table 1. For a typical synthesis,
first, 1.544 g of CaCl2·2H2O and 0.06–0.24
g of PEO were dissolved in H2O/EtOH solution (1.80 mL of
distilled water and 2.00 mL of EtOH were added, respectively). Then,
2.500 g of AlCl3·6H2O was added into the
solution, 0.60 mL of EG and 0.70 mL of FA were added in sequence.
After stirring at room-temperature for 2 h, the resultant homogeneous
solution was cooled to zero in an ice/water bath and 2.0 mL of PO
was added into the solution in a speed of 1 mL min–1. After stirring for 5 min, the obtained transparent solution was
degassed by ultrasonication for about 20 s to remove the bubbles in
the solution; thereafter it was gelated and aged at 45 °C for
more than 24 h and then evaporated at 60 °C for more than 72
h. Some of the obtained xerogels were heat-treated at 700, 900, and
1100 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min–1, respectively.

Reduction
The
reduction of C12A7 monoliths heat-treated
at 1100 °C was carried out in a dry crucible by 1.0 g of CaH2 as reductant, sealed in an evacuated quartz glass tube under
argon atmosphere protection (40 L min–1). The reduction
temperature and time were 500–1100 °C and 72 h, respectively.
The reduced monolith was washed with EtOH. The color of the monolith
changed from white to black after the reduction, and the monolithic
shape was retained.

Characterization
The morphology
and microstructure
of the fractured surfaces of the dried gels and heat-treated gels
were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU-70,
Hitachi, Ltd., Japan). The macropore size distribution over the diameter
from 20 nm to 100 mm of the dried gels and heat-treated gel monoliths
were evaluated by mercury intrusion porosimetry (Belsorp mini II,
Bel Japan Inc., Toyonaka, Japan, and AutoPore IV 9510, Micromeritics
Instrument Corp.). The crystal structure of the samples after heat-treatment
was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD: Empyrean 200895, PAN
analytical B.V., Holland). The porosity (%) of each sample was calculated
as [(1 – ρb)/ρs] –
100, (ρb and ρs are the bulk and
skeletal densities, respectively). Carrier concentrations of C12A7:e– were characterized by Hall measurement (HL5500, Nanometrics).

Calculation
The reduction process of C12A7 was calculated
by the CAmbride Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code. A model
of C12A7 crystal structure was simulated by the program and the free
oxygen ions were simulated to be replaced by the electrons. Thereafter,
the density of state (DOS) of reduced C12A7 and the model of the crystal
structure of reduced C12A7 had been calculated.
