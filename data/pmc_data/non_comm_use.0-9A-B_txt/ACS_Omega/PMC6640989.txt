The electrical transport properties
of a four-layered hydrogen-terminated
cubic boron nitride sub-nanometer film in contact with gold electrodes
are investigated via density functional calculations. The sample exhibits asymmetric metallic surfaces, a fundamental feature that
triggers the system to behave like a typical p–n junction diode
for voltage bias in the interval −0.2 ≤ V ≤ 0.2, where a rectification ratio up to 62 is verified.
Further, in the wider region −0.3 ≤ V ≤ 0.3, negative differential resistance with a peak-to-valley
ratio of 10 is observed. The qualitative behavior of the I–V characteristics is described in terms
of the hydrogenated cBN film equilibrium electronic structure. Such
a film shows metallic surfaces due to surface electronic states at
a fraction of eV above and below the Fermi level of the N–H
terminated and B–H terminated surfaces, respectively, with
a wide bulk-band gap characteristic of BN materials. Such a mechanism
is supported by transmission coefficient calculations, with the Landauer–Büttiker
formula governing the I–V characteristics.

1 Introduction
Boron and nitrogen can
be combined to form a binary compound, boron
nitride (BN), which exists in the same crystalline forms as the respective
carbon allotropes. In three dimensions, cubic BN (cBN) and wurtzite
BN are the analogs of diamond and lonsdaleite, respectively.1,2 In two dimensions, the analog of graphene is hexagonal BN (hBN)3−8 or white graphene and, in one dimension, BN can also form nanoribbons9,10 and nanotubes.11,12 As boron and nitrogen are the
left and right neighbors of carbon in the periodic table, respectively,
similarly structured carbon and BN materials show similar isoelectronic
bonds. However, unlike the C–C bond, the B–N bond is
polar, which may lead to distinct electronic and optical properties
of BN structures in comparison to those of their carbon analogs. For
instance, although graphene is a semimetal, hBN presents a wide band
gap, about 5–6 eV.3−6,8 Therefore, BN nanotubes,
which can be seen as an hBN layer wrapped into a cylinder, are always
wide-band gap semiconductors whereas carbon nanotubes can be either
metallic or semiconducting. In addition, because BN is a binary compound
the surfaces and edges of BN materials, unlike those of carbon materials,
can be either boron or nitrogen terminated. Thus, BN and carbon materials,
whose bulk properties are alike, such as cBN and diamond, can present
distinct electrochemical properties due to differences in surface
termination. Besides, in situations where the surface/bulk ratio is
large, such as the case of thin cBN films and narrow nanoribbons,
the surface termination can change the properties of the system as
a whole.13,14 Very recently, a detailed study of the growth
process of 2D hBN was reported,15 in which
case large single-crystal monolayer domains with controlled morphology
and straight merging boundaries were identified. The merging boundaries
were revealed by optical microscopy upon hydrogen etching at elevated
temperatures, thereby providing the possibility to fabricate hBN ribbons
by etching parallel grain boundaries.

Because clean diamond
and cBN surfaces are usually unstable, reconstructions
and/or adsorption of environmental chemical species are often observed.16 Reconstructions and covalent functionalization
of the (111) surface by several chemical species have already been
investigated by means of first-principles techniques, which have indicated
that H and F atoms are efficient as stabilizing agents.17 Such predictions have been verified experimentally,
where fluorination of hBN–graphene–hBN multilayers might
result in hybrid cBN/diamond nanofilms with sp3 hybridization
throughout the structures.18 In addition,
fluorination of few-layered hBN sheets can lead to formation of thermodynamically
favorable F-terminated cBN nanofilms with an embedded N–N bond
layer.19 It has also been demonstrated
that such covalent functionalization has a strong effect on BN electron
transport properties.20,21 For the hBN analog, graphene,
hydrogenation is a reversible process in which sp2 bonds
can be converted into sp3 bonds and vice-versa.22 In addition, it is possible to produce functionalized
diamond films (111) oriented from few-layered graphene by applying
pressure with an AFT tip.23 In principle,
such a process can be used to produce cBN films very similar to that
employed in this work. In particular, a gold AFM tip could generate
a metal–film interface analogous to that of our model, whereby
a thin (111) oriented hydrogenated cBN film is placed between gold
contacts, as is detailed in the next section.

The C–H,
B–H, and N–H bonds are not isoelectronic;
therefore, H-terminated diamond and H-terminated cBN must present
distinct electrochemical properties. Recent theoretical works indicate
that B–H and N–H terminated cBN surfaces are metallic,13,14 which is surprising because BN
materials are known for being wide gap insulators. The same works
have also shown that the band gap of thin H-terminated cBN films depends
on the film thickness, because, in a very thin film, opposite B–H
and N–H terminated surfaces interact with each other.13,14 A H-terminated cBN film was found to become metallic when its thickness
exceeded a critical threshold of 0.72 nm.13,14 However, the band gap of thin diamond films is nearly constant no
matter the film thickness.4,13

Unlike thin diamond
films, nanofilms of cBN have asymmetrical surfaces:
one N-terminated and one B-terminated surface. Such asymmetric
cBN films are expected to present interesting rectifying effects,
which is indeed supported by experimental and theoretical reports.9,12,24−28 Among them, it is worth mentioning the experimental
study28 where clear rectification in cBN/sp2BN/Si heterojunctions is observed. Further, the electron transport
behavior is characteristic of typical p–n junction diodes over
a range of temperatures varying from 298 up to 573 K. Very recently,
another study on the thermal stability of BN/Si p–n heterojunction
diodes was also reported.29 Such results
are interesting and present technological appeal because the cBN films
can be less than 1 nm thick (for the sake of comparison, the depletion
width of a p–n diode is over 50 nm wide30), which may allow for further miniaturization of optoelectronic
devices. Most importantly, new light-emitting diode properties were
verified on heterostructures of stacked 2D materials formed by hBN,
graphene, and MoS2, weakly coupled by
van der Waals forces.31 We would like to
emphasize that many BN nanostructure properties have been recently
reviewed, including their fabrication, functionalization, and applications.32 In addition, the use of Au nanofilms and nanoparticles
in the presence of BN films has attracted the attention of researchers
with a focus on industrial applications,33 including very interesting electrochemical properties.34

In this work, we employ first-principles
calculations based on
density functional theory (DFT) and nonequilibrium Green’s
function formalism to explore the electron transport properties of
very thin hydrogenated BN films coupled to metallic gold electrodes.
This work is organized as follows. Methodology and computational details
are given in Section 2, and the results and discussion are presented in Section 3. Section 4 ends the text with our concluding remarks.

2 Methodology and Computational Details
Our electronic
structure calculations were performed within the
framework of DFT,35,36 as implemented in the SIESTA
program.37 We used Troullier–Martin
norm conserving relativistic pseudopotentials in Kleinman–Bylander
nonlocal form.38,39 The exchange and correlation
energies were treated within the generalized gradient approximation
according to the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) parametrization.40,41 The Khon–Sham eigenfunctions were expanded in a linear combination
of numerical atomic orbitals42 of finite
range. The range of the orbitals was determined by the common energy
shift (0.01 Ry) in the energy eigenvalues imposed by confining potentials
in the pseudoatom problem. The split valence and perturbative polarization
methods were employed to generate a double-zeta basis for each angular
momentum plus polarization orbitals (the standard SIESTA DZP basis
set). The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 1 × 1 × 30
Monkhorst–Pack grid and a minimal 150 Ry mesh-cutoff energy
was used to determine real space grid fineness. Nonequilibrium Green’s
function techniques43,44 within the DFT framework previously
described (which is implemented in the TRANSIESTA program43) were employed to address the electron transport
properties. The current through the scattering region was calculated
using the Landauer–Büttiker formula45,46 1  where e is the electron charge, h is Planck’s constant, T(E, V) is the transmission probability of
electrons incident at energy E from the left to the
right electrode under an applied voltage bias V, fL(R) is the Fermi–Dirac distribution
function for the left (right) electrode with the respective chemical
potential  (and ) shifted upwards (downwards)
relative to
the Fermi energy EF. More specifically43,44 2  where ∑L(E) [∑L(R)] is
the self-energy of
the left (right) electrode, G(E)
is the solution of the equation (E – H)−1 = G(E), in a matrix format, with H including the Hamiltonians
of the sample (scattering region) and electrodes with their respective
self energies, and the off-diagonal terms related to the interaction
between these elements (contact region). The nonequilibrium solution
is obtained in a DFT self-consistent fashion,43 with the Landauer–Büttiker formula governing the I–V characteristics.

Our model is divided into
three regions: left and right semi-infinite
electrodes oriented in the (111) direction, and the scattering region.
The scattering region, indicated in Figure 1, contains the hydrogenated cBN film and
part of the left and right gold electrodes, which are connected to
the left and right semi-infinite electrodes in the transport calculations. Figure 2a,b shows the front
and side views of the Au(111) oriented right electrode, respectively,
used to calculate the right self-energy. It is composed of three Au(111)
oriented layers, and each layer contains nine Au atoms. The left Au electrode used to calculate the left self-energy is the
mirror image of the right electrode shown in Figure 2a,b.

Figure 1 Hydrogenated cBN nanofilm is composed of a four-layered
cBN film
oriented in the (111) direction and passivated with hydrogen at the
two opposite surfaces, wherein the H atoms bind to the N atoms (B
atoms), thus forming the N–H (B–H) terminated surface.
The scattering region contains the hydrogenated cBN film and part
of the left and right gold electrodes. Au atoms are yellow, B atoms
are green, N atoms are blue, and H atoms are white.

Figure 2 Top panels: (a) front and (b) side views of the Au(111)
oriented
right electrode. Lower panels: (c) front and (d) side view of the
hydrogenated four-layered cBN film.

The hydrogenated cBN film shown in Figure 2c,d is composed of a four-layered cBN(111)-oriented
film passivated with hydrogen at the surfaces, wherein the H atoms
bind to the N atoms to the left (B atoms to the right), thus forming
the N–H terminated surface (B–H terminated surface).
The layers of the hydrogenated cBN film are bound together more tightly
than those of the bulk cBN;13 the bond
length of the B–N bonds that connect the BN layers of the film
is shorter (1.5 Å13) than that of
the B–N bonds in bulk cBN (1.56 Å13,47). However, the B–N bonds of the same layer are longer (1.60
Å13) than the bulk B–N bonds.
The scattering region also contains part of the electrodes (10 Au
layers) to ensure a smooth connection of the hydrogenated cBN film
to the semi-infinite electrodes. In addition, it can be seen in Figure 1 that the left side
of the scattering region contains one extra layer of Au atoms (buffer
atoms); such a layer was added to allow the match between successive
periodic images in calculations where periodic boundary conditions
are imposed. In transport calculations, with open boundary conditions,
such a buffer layer is not taken into account and the electrode connects
to the following Au layer, whose geometry was chosen to match that
of the right layer of the left electrode. In total, Figure 1 is composed of 99 Au, 24 H,
48 B, and 48 N atoms.

The geometry shown in Figure 1 was optimized using the conjugated
gradient algorithm,
where the lattice is relaxed together with the atomic coordinates.
The cell parameters and atomic positions were optimized until both
the maximum component of the stress tensor and the force on atoms
were smaller than 1.0 GPa and 0.05 eV/Å, respectively. The obtained
unit cell vectors are , aĵ, and
4.25ak̂, where a = 8.94 Å.
The obtained
values of the B–N bonds were 1.52 Å (for B–N bonds
that connect any of the film layers) and 1.58 Å (for any bond
in the same layer), which indicates that contact with gold does not
have a strong affect on film geometry. The average value obtained
for the Au–Au bond (2.96 Å) is similar to that obtained
using similar DFT–PBE approaches (2.97 Å).48 The Au–Au bonds in the same (111) plane
are stretched due to the imposed commensurability with the cBN film;
however, the increase (0.03 Å or 1%) is small and it is reasonable
to argue that the hydrogenated cBN film and the Au layers commensurate
within the calculation precision. Also, the distance between neighbor
Au planes is constant (2.35 Å), which suggests that the effect
of the interaction with the film surface on the Au layer geometry
is negligible. The N–H and B–H distances are, respectively,
1.03 and 1.21 Å. We also found two different equilibrium distances
between gold and the hydrogenated cBN film: 2.6 and 2.8 Å for
the Au/N–H and Au/B–H interfaces, respectively. Such
a result indicates that interaction between gold and the N–H
surface is stronger than that with the B–H surface. A rough
estimative of the magnitude of the interaction between the hydrogenated
cBN film and the gold slabs can be obtained by increasing the H–Au
distances of both interfaces. For distance values of H–Au of
3, 4, and 5 Å, our calculated free energies (relative to the
equilibrium total energy) are 9.2, 13.5, and 16.6 eV, respectively.
Such values suggest a binding energy per unit of area greater than
0.3 eV/Å2, which is an interaction stronger than typical
dispersive van der Waals interactions (for the sake of comparison,
the binding energy per unit of area between graphene layers is about
0.01 eV/Å2).49 Such a result
is expected because the hydrogenated cBN film presents charged surfaces
that should induce surface charge on gold surfaces.

3 Results and Discussion
Figure 3 shows the
current–voltage I–V characteristics of the system described in Figure 1 for the bias range varying from −3.0
to 3.0 V. A positive bias V is obtained by shifting
the Fermi levels of the left and right electrodes by  and , respectively.
Thus, a positive current
flows from the left to the right electrode, and a negative current
flows in the opposite direction. It can be seen in Figure 3 that the calculated I–V characteristics sharply differ
from that expected for a symmetric scattering region, that is, −I(−V) ≠ I(V). In particular, in the voltage range between
−0.2 and 0.2 V, as shown in the inset of Figure 3, the absolute values of current obtained
for a positive bias are much larger than that obtained for a negative
bias, which is the typical I–V curve observed for p–n junction diodes. Such a behavior can
be better seen in a plot of the rectification ratio  as a function of the voltage, as can been
seen in the inset B of Figure 3. The maximum rectification occurs for values of V of about 0.2 V, where the rectification ratio is about 62.

Figure 3 I–V characteristics of the system shown
in Figure 1 for the
bias range −3.0 ≤ V ≤ 3.0 V.
Inset (a) displays a zoom of the interval −0.2 ≤ V ≤ 0.2, thus unveiling a behavior very similar to
that observed in p–n junction diodes. Inset (b) exhibits the
rectification ratio , whose salient
feature is the big peak
of 62 at 0.2 V, thus confirming the diode behavior and the observed
negative differential resistance.

Outside the voltage range between −0.2 and 0.2 V,
the I–V curve of the thin hydrogenated cBN
film sharply
differs from that of an ordinary p–n junction diode. Just above
0.2 V, a region of negative differential resistance (NDR, i.e., increased
resistance with increasing voltage) with a peak-to-valley ratio of
about 10 is observed, which could be useful in practical applications,
such as NDR devices. For the sake of comparison, the peak-to-valley
ratio of organic thiolated molecules is about 1.6.50 Such a fast drop in current with increased voltage leads
to a fast decrease in the rectification ratio, as can be seen in the
inset B of Figure 3, which would limit the use of hydrogenated cBN thin films as rectifiers
to the range between −0.2 and 0.2 V.

To understand the
origin of the asymmetric behavior of the I–V curve, we further investigated the electronic
structure of the hydrogenated four-layered cBN film. The density of
electron states projected (PDOS) on the H and N atoms of the N–H
terminated surface and on the B and H atoms of the B–H terminated
surface is shown in the middle panels of Figure 4. It can be seen that the N–H terminated
surface is metallic but it presents, just below the Fermi level, a
wide energy gap (over 4 eV wide), where there are no electron levels
available. On the other hand, the density of electron states projected
on the H and B atoms of the B–H surface shows a wide energy
gap (also over 4 eV wide) just above the Fermi level. In addition,
a sharp peak in the density of electron states for the B–H
surface is observed just below the Fermi level, which shows the existence
of an electron state localized near the B–H bond. We stress
that the PDOS on the N–H and B–H surfaces displayed
in the central panel of Figure 4 is consistent with the calculated electronic band structure
of hydrogenated cBN.13,14 Both the B–H and N–H
terminated surfaces are metallic. However, in the case of the N–H
terminated surface, the Fermi levels are near the bottom of bands
with positive curvature above a wide band gap. Meanwhile, at the B–H
terminated surface, the Fermi level is near the top of bands with
negative curvature just below an energy gap.13,14 As demonstrated by Zhang and Guo,13 the
electron states near the Fermi level in the N–H terminated
surfaces are due to pz orbitals of N atoms
binding H atoms (where the z direction is perpendicular
to the film). Those states are peaked outside the nanofilm (at 2.2
Å from the N-end surface) and behave like nearly free electron
states. On the other hand, the electron levels near the Fermi level
at the B–H terminated surface are due to px and py orbitals of N atoms near
to the B–H terminated surface.13 This can be understood in terms of the polar nature of B–N
sp3 bonds, which are isoelectronic to the apolar sp3 C–C bonds. In the cBN bulk, the excess of electrons
of the N orbitals is precisely offset by the lack of electrons in
the B orbitals (as a result, cBN presents a band gap as wide as that
of diamond carbon). In the case of the N–H terminated surface,
the N atoms cannot transfer electrons to the H atoms as they do to
the B atoms, which results in the semioccupied pz bands mentioned before. Likewise, the B atoms of the B–H
terminated surface cannot receive electrons from H atoms as they do
from the N atoms, which affects the sp3 B–N bonds
just below the B–H terminated surface, giving rise to the semioccupied
px and py orbitals
and the observed peak in the PDOS on the referred surface.

Figure 4 Scheme illustrating
the system shown in Figure 1 under a voltage bias of V = 0.2 V. The left
(right) panel shows the PDOS on the surface of
the left (right) electrode in the energy interval −0.4 ≤ E ≤ 0.4 eV. The central panel exhibits the PDOS on
the N–H (B–H) surface in the wider energy interval:
−10 ≤ E ≤ 0 eV (the dashed line
indicates the Fermi level, which, to comply with the energy scale
of the electrodes, must be set at EF ≡
0). Under the bias, the chemical potential μL of
the left (right) electrode is shifted upwards (downwards) by 0.1 (−0.1)
eV relative to the Fermi level. Notice the sharp peak ≈0.2
eV below the Fermi level on the B–H surface. As explained in
the text, electrons can flow from left to right electrode due to the
peculiar combination of the PDOS shown in the above scheme.

On the basis of the discussed
electronic structure of the hydrogenated
cBN film, we propose a mechanism that describes the qualitative behavior
of the I–V curve shown in Figure 3a for a small applied
bias, as illustrated in Figure 4. The left and right panels of that figure show the projected
density of states on the left (LDOS) and right (RDOS) electrodes,
respectively, when a voltage bias of V = 0.2 V is
applied to the system, see Figure 4c. The chemical potential μL of the
left electrode (magenta dotted line) is shifted 0.1 eV upwards in
comparison with its original equilibrium position (red dashed line),
and the chemical potential μR of the right electrode
is shifted 0.1 eV downwards. Because there are empty levels available
(below the Fermi surface) on the N–H terminated surface in
contact with the left electrode and occupied levels (below the Fermi
surface) on the B–H terminated surface in contact with the
right electrode, electrons can flow from left to right electrode.
On the other hand, when a negative bias of V = −0.2
V is applied, the new configuration of Figure 4 is equivalent to an exchange of LDOS with
RDOS, as shown in Figure 5b,c, and the current traveling from right to left electrode
is strongly blocked by Coulomb repulsion. In short, when a small positive
bias is applied, the current traveling from right to left electrode
is very small in comparison to that traveling from left to right electrode.
However, a large voltage bias strongly affects the electronic structure
of the hydrogenated four-layered cBN film, and therefore the mechanism
described in Figure 4 is not expected to hold in such a situation.

Figure 5 PDOS at the surface atoms
of the left (LDOS) and right (RDOS) electrodes
are shown in (a), (b), and (c) at the voltages bias V = 0, −0.2, and 0.2 V, respectively. The LDOS and RDOS in
(c) are those used in Figure 4. Transmission coefficients of the system shown in Figure 1 are displayed in
(d), (e), and (f) for the corresponding voltages used in (a), (b),
and (c), respectively. For V = −0.2 V, the
current is null as T(E) is practically
zero in the interval −0.1 ≤ V ≤
0.1, whereas for V = 0.2 V, a peak confirms the mechanism
illustrated in Figure 4 and the diode behavior shown in the inset (a) of Figure 3.

The mechanism discussed above assumes that the transmission
coefficient
used to obtain the current is proportional to the hydrogenated four-layered
cBN equilibrium density of states for small values of applied bias.
Because there are energy gaps in the occupied states on the N–H
terminated surface and the empty states on the N–H terminated
surface, it is expected that the transmission coefficients within
the Landauer–Büttiker formula under the integration
window would be roughly zero for small values of negative applied
bias. Indeed, it can be seen in Figure 5e that the transmission coefficient between −0.1
and 0.1 eV is approximately null when a bias of V = −0.2 V is applied. However, Figure 5f shows a peak in the transmission coefficient
within the integration window for a bias of V = 0.2
V, which is also expected based on the existence of a peak in the
PDOS on the B–H surface, as shown in the central panel of Figure 4. Because the hydrogenated
cBN film is metallic, the band gap problem should not prevent PBE
calculations from correctly predicting the Fermi level alignment relative
to the gold electrode. In any case, we also argue that if a more elaborate
calculation indicates a small change in the location of the sharp
peak in the density of states for the B–H surface, the peak
in T(E, V) and
the corresponding p–n junction diode behavior, shown in Figures 5f and 3a, respectively, would both sustain if the voltage bias is
tuned accordingly, so as to allow the referred sharp peak to contribute
to the current. Lastly, we remark that in our work, about a hundred T(E, V) curves (for voltage
bias between −3 and 3) have been calculated to obtain, by means
of eq 1, each one of
the values of current shown in Figure 3 for a given voltage V. Similarly
to the case of T(E, V = ±0.2 V), shown in Figure 5, the scale of any other calculated T(E, V) curve is of the order 10–5.

4 Conclusions
We employed
the nonequilibrium Green’s function formalism
within the DFT framework and the Landauer–Büttiker formula
to investigate the electron transport properties of a hydrogen-terminated
four-layered cBN nanofilm in contact with gold electrodes. This system
with asymmetric metallic surfaces gives rise to remarkable transport
properties. Indeed, we observed an I–V curve
similar to that of a p–n junction diode for values of voltage
between −0.2 and 0.2 V, with a rectification ratio up to 62.
In addition, just above 0.2 V, a region of negative differential resistance
with a peak-to-valley ratio of about 10 is observed. The qualitative
behavior of the obtained I–V curve is explained
based on features of the hydrogenated cBN nanofilm equilibrium electronic
structure, and ab initio calculation of the transmission coefficient.
The reported results add relevant information of both intrinsic interest
and potential applications in the realm of nanoelectronics.
