In this study, industrial wastes,
which remain after aluminum extraction
from saline slags, were used as adsorbents. The aluminum saline slags
were treated under reflux with 2 mol/dm3 aqueous solutions
of NaOH, H2SO4, and HCl for 2 h. After separation
by filtration, aqueous solutions containing the extracted aluminum
and residual wastes were obtained. The wastes were characterized by
nitrogen adsorption at −196 °C, X-ray diffraction, scanning
electron microscopy, and ammonia pulse chemisorption. The chemical
treatment reduced the specific surface area, from 84 to 23 m2/g, and the pore volume, from 0.136 to 0.052 cm3/g, of
the saline slag and increased the ammonia-adsorption capacity from
2.84 to 5.22 cm3/g, in the case of acid-treated solids.
The materials were applied for the removal of Acid Orange 7 and Acid
Blue 80 from aqueous solutions, considering both single and binary
systems. The results showed interesting differences in the adsorption
capacity between the samples. The saline slag treated with HCl rapidly
adsorbed all of the dyes present in solution, whereas the other materials
retained between 50 and 70% of the molecules present in solution.
The amount of Acid Orange 7 removed by the nontreated material and
by the material treated with NaOH increased in the presence of Acid
Blue 80, which can be considered as a synergistic behavior. The CO2 adsorption of the solids at several temperatures up to 200
°C was also evaluated under dry conditions. The aluminum saline
slag presented an adsorption capacity higher than the rest of treated
samples, a behavior that can be explained by the specific sites of
adsorption and the textural properties of the solids. The isosteric
heats of CO2 adsorption, determined from the Clausius–Clapeyron
equation, varied between 1.7 and 26.8 kJ/mol. The wastes should be
used as adsorbents for the selective removal of organic contaminants
in wastewater treatment.

1 Introduction
Related
to their complex aromatic structures, dyes present in industrial
effluents create bad taste, odors, and unsightly color and can even
have carcinogenic effects even at low concentrations. Acid dyes are
more problematic than basic ones because anions are very weakly retained
by most soil components and hence cause contamination of surface waters.1 Adsorption technologies have been proven to be
effective and cost-efficient for treating wastewaters with the presence
of organic contaminants because of their design simplicity, insensitivity
to toxic substances, and high efficiency.2,3 Several
adsorbents, including activated carbons and zeolites, among others,
are commonly used for this purpose. In addition, development of low-cost
adsorbents from industrial wastes has a growing interest; among them,
activated saline slags generated during secondary aluminum melting
processes are considered to be interesting materials for being used
in this field, as previously reported by our research groups.4

Multiple organic contaminants are usually
found in wastewater systems,
suggesting possible interactions between these organic molecules.
The competitive effects between these coexisting simultaneous contaminants
on removal must therefore be considered to study how these molecules
can be removed from wastewater. Although several studies have reported
adsorption processes for single-component systems,3 limited studies have considered the adsorption of organic
molecules in multiple systems.5−25 For example, the adsorption of three acid dyes, namely Acid Blue
80, Acid Red 114, and Acid Yellow 117, on an activated carbon showed
that the molecular size and chemical groups can contribute to the
relative differences found for the adsorption capacities of these
three dyes.6 Similarly, the activated carbon
produced from the phosphoric acid treatment of waste bamboo scaffolding
and activated at several temperatures was evaluated as an adsorbent
for two acid dyes by Chan et al.,15 who
reported an effect of the porosity of the activated carbons and the
molecular size of the dyes on the adsorption capacity. In a related
study, the simultaneous removal of two industrial dyes by adsorption
and photocatalysis on a fly ash TiO2 composite was studied
by Duta and Visa,20 and they found that
the efficiency of adsorption strongly depended on the microporous
structure of the adsorbent and that the kinetics depended on the flexibility
of the dyes. A mixed biosorbent containing carboxyl and amine groups
was prepared by Yu et al.21 to treat an
aqueous solution containing cationic and anionic dyes, namely Basic
Red 9 and Direct Red 28, whereas Yang et al.23 reported MnFe2O4 as an adsorbent for the removal
of Basic Blue 9 and Direct Red 28 in single and binary systems. Considering
single solutions, the adsorption rate for Basic Blue 9 was generally
higher than that for Direct Red 28, and the adsorption equilibrium
time for Basic Blue 9 was shorter than that for Direct Red 28. The
interaction between the dyes showed a synergistic effect, where the
adsorption of Direct Red 28 on the adsorbent was promoted. The surface
and porosity properties of the adsorbents and the characteristics
of the adsorbates are, in general, the factors that most affect the
adsorption process.

CO2 emissions to the atmosphere
must be controlled to
reduce the CO2 levels that affect global warming. Adsorbents
such as zeolites, carbon-derived materials, hydrotalcites, amine-functionalized
mesoporous silicas, and metal organic frameworks have been considered
as potential solids to capture CO2.26−30 The CO2 uptake capacities under several
conditions of temperature and pressure, the stability in the presence
of water, and the conditions for the regeneration of the materials
have been evaluated as important aspects to select the suitable adsorbents.
The development of effective low-cost and renewable CO2 adsorbents is also mandatory. With these ideas, CO2 adsorbents
from waste precursors have been reported, including byproducts derived
from coal, biomass, water treatment, eggshells and mussel shells,
lime mud, and fly ash, among others.31−34

In the present study, industrial
wastes resulting from the extraction
of aluminum from saline slag wastes were selected as porous adsorbents
for the uptake of Acid Blue 80 and Acid Orange 7 from aqueous solutions,
including both single and binary systems, and of CO2 in
the temperature interval from 50 to 200 °C and pressures up to
80 kPa. As a first objective, the study included the assessing of
the competitive behavior of Acid Orange 7 and Acid Blue 80 in single
and binary solutions. As a second objective, the study considered
the capacity of CO2 adsorption of the adsorbents at three
temperatures and up to a pressure of 80 kPa and the estimation of
the isosteric heat of adsorption using the Clausius–Clapeyron
equation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
of the Adsorbents
Acid and alkaline material treatments have
been widely studied for
the elimination of mineral impurities, disaggregation of particles,
and dissolution of elements such as Mg2+ or Al3+. Depending on the intensity and the type of material, the treatment
could produce modification of the textural properties and the number
of acid centers.4 When H3PO4 or H2SO4 is used in the treatment,
the incorporation of PO43– or SO42– onto the surface of the materials can
take place, which may affect their interaction with adsorbate molecules.

The N2 adsorption–desorption results for samples
at −196 °C are summarized in Figure 1. The adsorption isotherms are of type II
in the BDDT classification,35 with an H3-type
hysteresis loop.36 The hysteresis loop
is related to materials comprising aggregates of platelike particles
forming slitlike pores. The nitrogen adsorption capacity decreases
with the chemical treatment. In the case of sample-S and sample-Cl, both samples show almost the same
capacity. The results related to the textural properties of the reference
sample and the activated samples are listed in greater detail in Table 1. Treatment under
reflux conditions with water did not have a marked effect on the textural
properties of the reference sample. In contrast, the specific surface
area and pore volume of the sample decreased when treated with acids
or bases. The specific surface area decreases between 50 and 73% and
the total volume of pores decreases between 4 and 62%. Average pore
sizes increase with treatment, from 15.7 to 24.6 nm. These findings
suggest that a porous solid is dissolved during the treatments, mainly
under acid conditions. These results are in accordance with those
obtained previously, where the effect of time and concentration of
various chemical reagents was studied.4

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for sample-Na is very similar to that of sample (Figure 2), in agreement with the fact
that the raw sample was previously treated with water at high temperature
to remove the soluble salts usually present in this type of waste,
and this washing was actually carried out under alkaline conditions
as a consequence of the presence of nitrides in the raw sample.37 In the case of the samples treated with acids,
some diffraction peaks for the original sample, such as those for
calcite, disappear, whereas others, such as those for calcium and
magnesium sulfate, appear after the sample is treated with H2SO4. This suggests that Ca2+ is dissolved from
the slag by the acid treatment, that is, from calcite and calcium
aluminate, but it then precipitates as sulfate because of the insolubility
of this salt. The chemical composition of this type of waste is very
complex and depends on the raw material used. The main crystalline
phases detected by various authors include aluminum oxide (various
phases), metallic Al, magnesium aluminate, magnesium oxide, and calcium
aluminate.38−40 The main peaks from these phases are marked in Figure 2, confirming their
presence in our slag. The presence of other compounds (or elements)
was not detected although it cannot be ruled out; they may be in the
form of amorphous phases or also as crystalline phases but in very
low amounts, in both cases not detected by XRD.

The morphology changes caused
by the chemical treatments are compared
from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for the four samples
(Figure 3). No significant
differences can be observed between sample (A) and sample-Na (B). The particles from sample-S (C) had a small size and had the tendency to form aggregates. This
characteristic was not showed for the sample treated with HCl, sample-Cl (D). The qualitative composition of the samples
is also characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Several
metals and metal oxides are detected indicating the complexity of
the samples as an industrial waste. The presence of S in sample-S is also confirmed.

Ammonia chemisorption provides a measure of the concentration
of
acid sites. The total acidity results, as cmNH33/g, are given in Table 1. The acidity of the samples increases from 2.84 to
5.22 cm3 NH3/g after the activation treatment,
mainly in the case of samples treated with acids.

2.2 Dye Adsorption Experiments
The contact
time is a parameter that is known to control adsorption processes
to determine the equilibrium time.

The pH conditions strongly
influence the adsorption processes, as they condition the charge of
the dye molecules, the charge of the solid surface, and so forth.
Thus, to evaluate the effect of solution pH, 0.2 g of the sample was added to 100 cm3 of aqueous solutions
containing 15 mg/dm3 of AB80 or AO7 (0.022 and 0.042 mmol/dm3, respectively) at various pH values in the range of 2–9.
The resulting suspensions were shaken for 120 min. The maximum percentage
of dye removal was observed at pH 2, which is explained by the electrostatic
interactions between the adsorbate and the surface of the adsorbents.
One of the main parameters reported to govern adsorption is the point
of zero charge (pzc) of the surface of the solids. By this reason,
the pHpzc of solids, sample, sample-Na, sample-Cl, and sample-S, was
determined according to the method previously reported41 and found to be 8.6, 9.7, 3.7, and 2.0, respectively
(see Table 1). Under
the pH conditions for adsorption, all samples show a positively charged
surface; therefore adsorption is improved at acidic pH. In the case
of the dye molecules, the values of pKa must be taken into account (see Table S1, Supporting Information). Similar trends have been reported by other authors,
such as Kyzas et al.,42 who described the adsorption of Acid Orange 7 and Acid
Green 25 on the surface of cerium oxide. Also considering that a lot
of industrial wastewater is strongly acidic, a pH value of 2 was selected
for the additional experiments.

The evolution of the amounts
of dye adsorbed with time for the
single solutions is shown in Figure 4. Dye removal was rapid in the initial stages, reaching
equilibrium after around 40 min. Moreover, AB80 adsorbs more rapidly
than AO7. The factors affecting the adsorption selectivity of an adsorbent
for several kinds of adsorbates may be related to the characteristics
of the active sites (functional groups, porous structure, surface
properties, etc.), the characteristics of the adsorbates (molecular
structure, ionic nature, etc.), and the solution chemistry (ionic
strength, pH, etc.).4,6,10,11,13 The adsorption
of acidic dyes is mostly governed by physical adsorption; therefore,
the structure of these dyes could be the principal factor that affects
the adsorption capacity.8 The acidic dyes
used in this study contain two (AB80) and one sulfonic acid groups
(AO7) (see Table S1, Supporting Information), and therefore these differences could explain their adsorption
behavior when only one adsorbate is considered. Several authors have
explained the results found for other dyes on the basis of the structures
of the molecules and the porosity properties of the adsorbents, mainly
activated carbons, which have high specific surface areas.15,20,42,43 In the case of industrial wastes, which do not tend to be carbon-based,
the chemical surface properties should be taken into consideration
when explaining the removal of dyes from aqueous solutions. In general,
the adsorption capacity of the waste increased after chemical treatment
with HCl, H2SO4, and NaOH (see the results summarized
in Figure 4). Thus,
the adsorption capacity of the activated wastes increased from 9.7
μmol/g for AO7 and the nonactivated waste (sample) to 20.7 μmol/g for the activated waste treated with HCl (sample-Cl). The wastes treated with NaOH and H2SO4 showed the same adsorption capacity, 13.6 μmol/g.
In the case of AB80, the adsorption capacities obtained were 5.7 (sample), 8.0 (sample-S), 8.3 (sample-Na), and 11.0 μmol/g (sample-Cl). The efficiency
of adsorption was also determined by taking into account the amounts
of dyes adsorbed and the initial amounts brought into contact with
the adsorbents. In general, the adsorbents removed more AB80 than
AO7, probably because of the sulfonic acid groups on the molecules.
Thus, sample-Cl adsorbed 100% of the dyes present
in solution, without differentiating between one dye and the other,
whereas sample-S and sample-Na adsorbed
between 73 and 79% of AB80 and 66% of AO7. The nonactivated waste
adsorbed 47% of AO7 and 52% of AB80. These experimental results indicate
that the acid sites on the surface of the adsorbents appear to favor
the interaction with acid dyes. In this context and also considering
the phases identified by XRD (see Figure 2), alumina and calcium aluminate are the
two phases that may be more easily protonated at low pH. Although
the presence of sulfate on the surface (see Figure 3, EDX analysis) increases the acidity of
the solid, it also reduces the adsorption capacity of the material
by interaction/repulsion with the dye molecules. The adsorption capacity
remains at the same level for the sample activated with NaOH. The
maximum amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium was reached after 120
min for all samples.

Figure 4 Kinetic adsorption data of AB80 and AO7 using samples
as adsorbents. T = 25 °C, C0 = 15 mg/dm3 (0.022 mmol/dm3 for
AB80 and 0.022 mmol/dm3 for AO7), and pH = 2. The lines
represent a pseudo-first-order
model (__) and a pseudo-second-order model (---).

The reusability of the materials
was estimated from the solids
separated from the liquid by centrifugation. The samples were treated
with 0.1 mol/dm3 of NaCl for 1 h to desorb the organic
molecules. The saline solution was filtered from the solid by a new
cycle of centrifugation, and the solid was washed several times with
deionized water before being reused as the adsorbent. The process
was duplicated, and the amount of AB80 and AO7 adsorbed for each reuse
stage is given in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Reusability of the samples for AB80 and AO7 adsorption.

The comparative evolution of the amounts of dyes
adsorbed with
time for the single and binary solutions is shown in Figure 6. When the adsorption of the
dyes occurs individually, AO7 is adsorbed to a greater extent compared
to AB80. A comparison of the results obtained when the binary system
is used shows clear differences between the adsorbents. Thus, sample and sample-Na adsorb high quantities
of AO7, even higher than the amounts of this dye adsorbed in the single
systems. This result suggests that the adsorption of AO7 is affected
by the presence of AB80 during the competitive process. The increase
in the adsorption of AO7 suggests that synergistic AB80 adsorption
forces AO7 to be retained at sorption sites with greater affinity. Sample-Cl adsorbs the same amount of dyes in the binary
solution as when the dyes are in single solutions. Sample-S adsorbs lower amount for both dye molecules. Thus, when the two
molecules are adsorbed individually, the materials do not selectively
adsorb either of them, only with differences in the adsorption rate
at the initial stages. When both molecules are present in the same
solution, sample and sample-Na selectively
adsorb AO7, which may allow this molecule to be separated from AB80.
Acid-activated solids exhibit practically no differences in adsorption
when both molecules are present in solution, mainly in the case of sample-Cl.

Figure 6 Kinetic adsorption data of AB80 and AO7 using samples
as adsorbents
for single and binary systems.

Equations 6 and 7 were used to predict the mechanism involved in the
adsorption process of dyes on activated samples,
with the adsorption kinetic parameters being estimated by nonlinear
regression (see Figure 4 and Tables S2 and S3, Supporting Information). By analyzing the coefficient of determination (R) and the chi-square test (χ2) values of the kinetic
models, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was the best in describing
the adsorption kinetics of dyes in single and binary component systems.
As described in the Theoretical Approach section, such kinetic models
are better considered as simple empirical equations useful for predicting
the kinetics of adsorption systems and for designing adsorption units
but do not reflect the chemical and physical phenomena occurring.
Additionally, as the concentrations of dyes used for this type of
tests are small, adsorption in monolayer or adsorption in specific
adsorption sites will be favored, which could be considered as chemisorption.
In the same way, the values and trends of the constants of these models
(k1 and k2) do not allow to reach any conclusion.

To better understand
the adsorption mechanism of AO7 and AB80 on
activated samples, the intraparticle diffusion model was considered.
The qt versus t0.5 plots for the adsorption of dyes are given
in Figure S1, whereas Tables S2 and S3 list the related parameters. The first linear
portions represent the external mass transfer and the binding of the
dye by the active sites distributed on the surface of activated samples.
The second linear portions, which determine the adsorption rate, describe
intraparticle diffusion and binding of dyes by active sites inside
the pores of activated samples. As can be deduced from the data in Tables S2 and S3, the k3 values increase with chemical activation, indicating fast
adsorption of the dyes on the surface of the solids. Table 2 summarizes the effective diffusion
coefficients. The low values of D/r2 can be related to the limited participation of intraparticle
diffusion in dye adsorption on the saline slags, also related to the
low textural properties of the materials. The activation of the materials
increases the diffusion coefficients, being higher for AB80 than for
AO7, probably due to the sulphonic acid groups of the dye molecules
(see Table S1, Supporting Information).

The equilibrium adsorption
isotherm was considered important to
describe the interactive behavior between adsorbates and adsorbents.
Langmuir isotherm equation was thus used for modeling the experimental
data. The parameters for the isotherm equation, estimated by nonlinear
regression, are summarized in Table S4 (Supporting Information). The affinity parameters of the adsorbents, kL, confirm the results obtained under kinetic
conditions. From them, it was observed that AO7 had more affinity
for the materials than AB80. In the case of the binary mixtures, the
values of the coefficients change slightly.

2.3 CO2 Adsorption Experiments
The CO2 adsorption
capacity of the samples at three temperatures
and pressures up to 80 kPa are shown in Figure 7. The adsorbed CO2 evolution with
the temperature indicates that there is a physical interaction between
the surface of the solids and CO2. The aluminum saline
slag, sample, showed higher adsorption capacity than
the wastes. At low pressures, sample and sample-Na show a similar and high capacity of adsorption,
but at high pressures, the differences are more important. The adsorption
at low pressures can be related to the interaction with specific sites
of adsorption, estimated in this case by pHpzc and V(NH3), see Table 1. The
differences in textural properties can explain the results at high
pressures.44Sample shows
a specific surface area of 84 m2/g and a micropore volume
of 0.010 cm3/g in comparison to 42 m2/g and
0.002 cm3/g shown by sample-Na. In the
case of the samples treated with acids, the low adsorption capacity
of CO2 at low pressures with respect to the results observed
for sample and sample-Na can be
explained by the differences between pHpzc and V(NH3),
from 2.0–3.7 to 8.6–9.7 for pHpzc and from 5.21–5.22
to 2.84–3.35 cm3/g for V(NH3). The low
textural properties of the samples treated with acids also explain
the results at high pressures. The experimental results indicate that
the aluminum saline slags can be used as adsorbents to retain CO2 and that the chemical activation of these solids does not
increase their adsorption capacity.

Figure 7 CO2 adsorption on the samples
at 50, 100, and 200 °C.

A comparison of the Henry’s constants (H), obtained from the isotherms in the low-pressure region (Table 3), showed that the
constants were higher for sample and sample-Na than for sample-S and sample-Cl, and that the values decreased as the temperature increased. This
behavior is related to a more important interaction of CO2 on the surface of the wastes at low temperatures and pressures.
These results are also used to calculate the limiting heat, qst0, by applying the Clausius–Clapeyron equation in the low-pressure
region.45 The isosteric heats obtained
are included in Table 3, showing that the values for sample and sample-Na were lower than for sample-S and sample-Cl in accordance with the adsorption capacity in
this range of pressures.

The dependence
of the isosteric heats of adsorption, calculated
using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, on the amount adsorbed
for the samples is shown in Figure 8. The results obtained show that for sample and sample-Cl, the isosteric heats are constant
with loading, increasing at low loading in the case of sample-Na and sample-S. Schwaab et al.46 reported that
the evolution of the isosteric heats with adsorbate loading can be
related to the energetically homogeneous/heterogeneous character of
the adsorbents. In the case of sample and sample-Cl, the samples are energetically homogeneous toward
CO2 adsorption. In the same way, sample and sample-S are energetically heterogeneous.

3 Summary and Conclusions
Herein, we
have presented wastes produced, after the extraction
of aluminum from saline slags generated during secondary aluminum
recycling processes, as adsorbents for organic contaminants in contaminated
liquid streams and CO2 removal. The materials were obtained
by the treatment of saline slags with 2 mol/dm3 aqueous
solutions of NaOH, H2SO4, and HCl under reflux
conditions, which at the same time extracts a valuable amount of aluminum
from the slag. The treatments modify the acidity–basicity properties
of the solids. The resulting materials have been used as adsorbents
for the removal of the acid dyes Acid Orange 7 and Acid Blue 80, considering
single and binary component systems, and CO2 storage.

Taking into account the individual solutions, the preferential
adsorption of AB80 compared to AO7 seems to be related to the number
of sulfonic acid groups present in the dye molecules. The treatment
of saline slag with aqueous solutions of HCl increases the acidic
properties of the solids and their dye-adsorption capacity. In the
case of treatment with aqueous H2SO4 solutions,
the adsorption capacity of dyes is not favored by the presence of
sulfate groups on the surface. A preferential adsorption of AO7 is
observed compared to AB80 in binary solutions when using the starting
material and the NaOH-treated solid. No preferential adsorption is
found in the case of the adsorbents obtained upon treatment with acids.
Kinetic results allow to deduce that the adsorption of AO7 and AB80
on the aluminum saline slags takes place via a monolayer adsorption
process. As a final conclusion, untreated starting materials or those
treated with a base could be suitable for separating the components
from the binary solutions.

temperature indicates that there is a physical interaction between
the surface of the wastes and CO2. The adsorption on specific
sites and the textural properties can explain the differences between
the materials. The isosteric heats of CO2 adsorption from
the Clausius–Clapeyron equation varied in the range of 1.7–26.8
kJ/mol.

4 Experimental Procedure
4.1 Materials
Reagents used for the chemical
activation of the aluminum saline slags were NaOH (Panreac), H2SO4 (98%, Panreac), and HCl (37%, Acros). Acid
Blue 80 (Merck, 40%) and Acid Orange 7 (Aldrich, 85%) were selected
as representative acid dyes. NH3 (Air Liquide, >99.995%),
CO2 (Praxair, 99.990%), N2 (Praxair, 99.999%),
and He (Air Liquide, 99.998%) were also used.

4.2 Adsorbents
from Wastes
An aluminum
saline slag previously treated with hot water was used as the material.
The procedure and conditions for aluminum extraction with NaOH, H2SO4, and HCl are reported in previous works.4,47 The results of aluminum extracted, determined by inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, are included in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), and the aluminum thus
extracted was used for the synthesis of new materials.47 After the chemical reaction for aluminum extraction,
the slurries were separated by filtration and washed several times
with deionized water. The solids obtained, that is, the residual wastes,
were dried at 60 °C for 16 h and considered as adsorbents of
acid dyes and CO2. The nomenclature used for these solids
is sample-Y, where Y is the reagent used in the chemical
activation. Thus, for example, sample-Na is a solid
treated with an aqueous solution of 2 mol/dm3 NaOH for
2 h under reflux conditions.

4.3 Characterization Techniques
N2 (Praxair, 99.999%) adsorption–desorption measurements
were obtained at −196 °C from a Micromeritics ASAP 2010
adsorption analyzer. The powder XRD patterns of the materials were
carried out using a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer. SEM analysis of
the samples was considered using a JEOL microscope, model JSM-6400.

pHpzc was determined from mass titrations by a procedure previously
reported.41

The acidity of the samples
was determined by adsorption of NH3 using a dynamic pulse
method. The procedure and conditions
are reported in a previous work.48

4.4 CO2 Adsorption Experiments
The procedure
and conditions used for adsorption of CO2 at several temperatures
are reported in a previous work.47

4.5 Dye Adsorption Procedure
Acid Blue
80 (AB80) and Acid Orange 7 (AO7) were selected as anionic dyes for
this research. The properties of the dyes are summarized in Table
S1 (Supporting Information). The concentration
of the dye molecules in aqueous solutions was determined by an ultraviolet–visible
spectrophotometer, Jasco V-730, at the maxima wavelength of absorption
found, 485 and 627 nm for AO7 and AB80. The maximum absorbance was
confirmed by scanning aqueous solutions of the dye over the spectral
range of 290–800 nm. As the absorbance peaks are well-separated
in binary solutions, they can be used for concentration measurements.
Calibration curves for both individual dyes and the binary system
were carried out at a pH value of 2; this pH value was also used for
the adsorption processes (see below).

The adsorption kinetics
experiments were evaluated in the batch mode. Thus, three stock solutions
of Acid Orange 7 (15 mg/dm3, 0.022 mmol/dm3),
Acid Blue 80 (15 mg/dm3, 0.043 mmol/dm3), and
a binary system containing AO7 and AB80 (ratio of 1:1, totalizing
30 mg/dm3) were used. In a typical experiment, 0.2 g of
the adsorbent was placed in contact with 100 cm3 of the
dye solution at a pH value of 2, and the mixture was stirred for predetermined
intervals of time (between 0.5 and 120 min). The solution was then
separated from the adsorbent by filtration using Durapore membrane
filters with a pore size of 0.45 μm. The amount of dye adsorbed
on the waste (qt) was
calculated by the equation 1  where C0 is the
initial concentration (μmol/dm3), Ct is the concentration (μmol/dm3) at a certain adsorption time t (min), V is the solution volume (dm3), and m is the amount of sample added (g).

The equilibrium adsorption
capacity was determined from various
initial concentrations of the dyes. The procedure and conditions are
reported in a previous work.49 The amount
of dye adsorbed on the material at equilibrium (qe) was determined according to eq 1, where Ce (μmol/dm3) is the concentration of the dye at equilibrium. All experiments
were carried out in duplicate.

4.4.1 Theoretical Approach:
Adsorption Kinetics
The transport of adsorbate molecules
inside porous adsorbents can
be described by two types of kinetic modeling approaches.50 The first type of model considers simple relationships
between the adsorption process and the operating conditions. These
types of models describe how the average solid-phase concentration
(q) changes with the time of adsorption. Pseudo-first-
and pseudo-second-order rate equations are included in this category.
The second approach includes phenomenological models that attempt
to describe the adsorption rate through the resistances of external
mass transfer, intraparticle diffusion, and adsorption on the sites.
Information on the adsorption mechanism can be obtained from the second
type of models using the kinetic experimental results and the equilibrium
adsorption data.

Considering mass balances to the liquid phase
in the batch system and assuming first- and second-order kinetics
for the driving force term, the following equations are obtained 2   3  where n (mmol) is the amount
of organic molecule in the liquid phase, V (cm3) is the volume of the solution, C (mmol/dm3) is the organic molecule concentration in the solution, m (g) is the adsorbent mass, t (min) is
the contact time, and k1 (1/min) and k2 (g/mmol·min) are the adsorption kinetic
constants of the pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order.

The
equations can be integrated between the initial time and time t and by considering the initial conditions (for t = 0, C = C0). Under these situations, the following equations are obtained 4   5  

The equations can also be expressed considering the relationship
between the organic molecule concentration in the aqueous solution
(C) and in the solid phase (q) as 6   7  

These two equations have been employed to explain the adsorption
of aqueous pollutants on adsorbents.4,51−56

The intraparticle diffusion model is applicable only within
restrictive
conditions. This model assumes that intraparticle diffusion is the
rate-controlling step of the adsorption process.57 This is the case when well-mixed solutions are considered.
Under these situations, the intraparticle diffusivity is constant,
and the uptake of the adsorbate by the material is small if the total
quantity of the adsorbate present in the solution is taken into consideration.
The equation for this model is 8  where k3 (mmol/g·min0.5) is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant. This model
has been previously applied to several adsorption systems.9,51,54,58,59

The effective diffusion coefficient
can be calculated from the
fractional approach to the equilibrium, F(t)60 9  where D (m2/s)
is the intraparticle diffusion coefficient and r (m)
is the particle size radius assuming a spherical geometry.

4.4.2 Theoretical Approach: Equilibrium
The adsorption equilibrium
is often expressed by various isotherm
equations.50 The Langmuir model considers
monolayer coverage of adsorbent surfaces and can be represented for
multicomponent studies as 10  where kL,i (dm3/μmol) and qL,i (μmol/g) are Langmuir constants that represent
the equilibrium adsorption related to the affinity of binding sites
and the monolayer adsorption capacity. This equation assumes that
all adsorbates compete for energetically identical adsorption sites.
