Since the advent
of large-scale U mining, processing, and enrichment
for energy or weapons production, efficient capture and disposal of
U, transuranics, and daughter radionuclides has constituted an omnipresent
challenge. In this study, we investigated uranyl (UO22+) sequestration by hydrotalcite (HTC) as a coprecipitation
or surface adsorption reaction scenario. The master variables of the
study were pH (7.0 and 9.5) and CO2 content during the
reactions (CO2-rich, CO2r vs CO2-depleted,
CO2p). In addition, we compared the outcomes of U–HTC
coprecipitation reactions between pristine salt precursors and barren
U mine wastewater (lixiviant). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure
spectra revealed that uranyl adsorbs on the HTC surface as inner-sphere
complexes in CO2r and CO2p systems with U–Mg/Al
interatomic distances of ∼3.20 and ∼3.35 Å indicative
of single-edge (1E) and double-edge (2E) sharing
complexes, respectively. Partial coordination of uranyl by carbonate
ligands in CO2r systems does not appear to hinder surface
complexation, suggesting ligand-exchange mechanisms to be operative
for the formation of inner-sphere surface complexes. Uranyl symmetry
is maintained when coprecipitated with Al and Mg from synthetic or
barren lixiviant solutions, precluding incorporation into the HTC
lattice. Uranyl ions, however, are surrounded by up to 3–5
Mg/Al atoms in coprecipitated samples interfering with HTC crystal
growth. Future research should explore the potential of Fe(II) or
Mn(II) to reduce U(VI) to U(V), which is conducive for U incorporation
into octahedral crystal lattice positions of the hydroxide sheet.

Introduction
Efficient capture and
containment of U, transuranics, daughter
radionuclides, and other contaminants from U mining, processing wastewater,
and nuclear accidents is an essential component to ensure an environmentally
and socially responsible operational lifecycle of the U industry.1−4 Although a number of conventional technologies such as ion exchange
are available to address one or more contaminants, few technologies
are able to efficiently capture a range of geochemically diverse contaminants
often present and to rapidly convert them into a stable, solid form.
Layered-double hydroxide (LDH) anionic clays, specifically hydrotalcite
(HTC, {[Mg1–x,Alx](OH)2}Ax/m–m–·nH2O, e.g., A = 1/2SO42–, 1/2CO32– or 1NO3–), have been investigated extensively over a wide range of pH, ionic
strengths, and with various ligands (EDTA, citrate, carbonate, nitrate,
and sulfate), to be effective U scavengers under controlled laboratory
settings.5−11 However, few studies have been able to test HTCs on actual, real-life
U-containing samples. Recent research undertaken by CSIRO tested the
in situ formation of HTCs as a broad spectrum repository for a range
of cationic and anionic contaminant species on Heathgate Resources’
Beverley North (South Australia) in situ recovery (ISR) barren mine
lixiviant12 and on tailings pond water
from ERA’s Ranger Mine (Northern Territory13). This research and related studies at laboratory14,15 and industrial scale16 have demonstrated
that the in situ HTC formation, initiated by the tailored addition
of Mg or Al salts to produce a suitable M2+/M3+ molar ratio and the addition of base (OH–), appears
to incorporate a suite of contaminants either in the metal hydroxide
layer or as interlayer anions to balance structural charge requirements.
These HTCs have sequestered U at up to 1% (w/w) from an initially
acidic ISR barren lixiviant containing ca. 20 mg/L U, highlighting
the substantial concentration factor achievable.12,13,17

The suite of cationic, neutral, and
anionic uranyl species present
across the pH spectrum (Figure S1) during
neutralization raises questions as to the nature of the associations
between uranyl and HTC and the specific role carbonate ligands may
play in affecting the outcome of U solid-phase speciation. Despite
the extensive research into the U–HTC reactions at the laboratory
scale, to date (and to the best of our knowledge), the molecular-scale
bonding environments of U in or on HTCs have not yet been reported.
In this study, we present data on the solid-phase speciation of U
adsorbed on or coprecipitated with HTC, in CO2-enriched
(CO2r) or CO2-depleted (CO2p) atmospheres
at pH 7.0 and 9.5. These results address the yet-unanswered questions
about the speciation and fate of U during the reaction with HTC: Is
U incorporated into the primary metal hydroxide layers? Is it adsorbed
on its surfaces or alternatively does it occur in the HTC interlayers
as anionic uranyl carbonate or other anionic complexes? How does atmospheric
CO2 influence the reaction outcomes? Finally, we propose
four reaction schemes exploring the effects of CO2 and
pH on uranyl surface complexation and concomitant anion-exchange reactions.

Results
and Discussion
Composition of the HTC Solids
The
final Al, Mg, and
U contents in the HTC solids (Table S3)
varied as a function of pH and CO2r/CO2p environment.
All samples were deficient in Mg relative to the intended M2+/M3+ ratio of 3:1, leading to an excess positive charge
ranging from +0.5 (HTC3 CO2p) to +0.29 (HTC1 CO2r). Magnesium dissolved in the HTC3 samples at pH 7.0 causes the
Mg/Al ratio to decrease from 2.73 in the pure HTC3 sample to 2.0 in
the HTC3 CO2p sample. As incorporation of Al and U into
the solids was similar, one could not assume necessarily that either
replaced Mg in the structure extensively, as U uptake was near 100%
in nearly all cases. Less than the ideal Mg content in the HTC structure
at pH 7.0 may thus have caused the permanent positive charge to increase
from 0.37 to 0.50, assuming an intact oxyanion framework (Table S3).

Uranyl uptake from solution
ranged from 72 to 100%. Considering only the chemically purer systems
(HTC2 and HTC3), the uptake was in all cases essentially complete
(97–100%). In the CO2r atmosphere, only 72% of available
U was sequestered by the barren lixiviant HTC1 solid as opposed to
100% uptake into the corresponding CO2p sample. On the
basis of the comparison between the coprecipitation systems of HTC2
and the adsorption systems of HTC3, U retention in the interlayer
on the mineral surface and/or incorporation in the metal hydroxide
sheets was hence significant.

Structure of the HTC Solids
The HTC1 and HTC2 CO2r samples bear close resemblance
to the prototypical HTC pattern
(Mg6Al2CO3(OH)16(H2O)418,24), and their (003) and (006) spacings
(7.85 ± 0.02 Å) are consistent with the mean interlayer
distance for HTC intercalated with CO325 (Figure S2). The HTC1 and HTC2
CO2p samples and the pure HTC sample (HTC3 prior to adsorption
tests) closely resembled each other, but their interlayer distances
((003) and (006)) occurred at lower deg 2θ and hence greater d-spacing (8.65 ± 0.10 and 8.46 Å, respectively)
than for the CO2r samples consistent with the mixed SO4/NO3 interlayers (8.8/8.1 Å25), reflecting the exclusion of CO2 from the synthesis
liquors, the SO4/NO3 salts of Mg and Al used
in their synthesis and the anion selectivity sequence for HTC and
LDH phases determined previously.26 The
HTC interlayer distance is furthermore directly related to the Al
content (ionic radii of octahedral Al3+ and Mg2+ are 0.535 and 0.72 Å, respectively27), and the data (Table S4) reflect an
expansion of the interlayer with decreasing Al content as previously
reported.28 The unit cell length a (=b) ranged between 3.052 (HTC2 CO2p)
and 3.080 Å (HTC1 CO2r) with a noticeable effect from
CO2r atmospheres and higher Al contents on a. The unit cell volumes of the HTC1 and HTC2 CO2p samples
were expanded in comparison to the HTC3 unit cell volume. This expansion
cannot be explained on the basis of U incorporation because octahedral
U(VI, 0.73 Å) has a comparable ionic/crystal radius to octahedral
Mg2+ (0.72 Å29).

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of the prominent (003) and (006)
reflections were broad in all samples, indicating the presence of
small crystallites. Application of the Scherrer equation to the (003)
and (006) reflections indicated a mean crystallite size along the c-axis of 25.1 ± 15.0 nm with a range of 7.5 (HTC1,
CO2p) to 96.0 nm (HTC2, CO2r, Table S4). Crystallite sizes in the ab plane
(120 reflection) indicate variations between 23 nm (HTC1 CO2r) and 366 nm (HTC3) consistent with previous reports.30,31

In the barren lixiviant CO2r HTC1 sample, aragonite,
CaCO3 (Pmcn32) was identified. This is not unexpected, as the addition of CO2 and NaOH to a solution containing calcium ions (5.7 mM) can
be predicted to precipitate calcium carbonate. Aragonite is a known
scavenger of UO22+ from solution,33 and hence, extended X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) data in this study might reflect mixed-surface U bonding environments
stemming from HTC as well as from aragonite. Evidence for Al(OH)3 (s) formation, for example, gibbsite, as a result of the
low-to-high pH adjustment, was not found in the diffraction patterns.

First Ligand Shells of Uranyl
Complementary U L-III
edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and EXAFS spectra
were collected to identify and estimate neighboring atoms in the bonding
environment of U in the HTC samples. All spectra contained a shoulder
feature on the high-energy side of the white line indicative of multiple
photoelectron scattering in the trans-, di-oxo uranyl moiety ({O=U=O}2+, UO22+).34 The primary difference between XANES spectra could be ascribed to
the presence or absence of CO2 in the reaction (Figure S3a). The CO2p samples (black
spectra) relative to the spectra of CO2r samples were phase-shifted
to higher energy noticeable with the first EXAFS oscillation near
17 210 eV (Figure S3a, inset). This
phase shift was most pronounced in synthetic, coprecipitated HTC2
samples at pH 9.5 and least pronounced in surface-adsorbed HTC3 samples
at pH 7.0. No other discernible differences in the XANES were observed
among the samples of CO2p or CO2r preparation,
suggesting that similar phases were formed within each atmospheric
environment (Figure S3b).

The EXAFS
spectra of CO2p and CO2r samples (Figure 1a,b) revealed significant differences
in the oscillatory structure of the sinusoidal wave functions. All
wave functions deteriorated in data quality above 11 Å–1, which could generally be ascribed to low U concentrations in the
samples and increasingly less coordinated photoelectron scattering
with distance from the central absorber.

Figure 1 k3-Weighted U L-III EXAFS spectra of
adsorption and coprecipitation samples for (a) CO2r atmospheres
and (b) CO2p atmospheres: 1 = HTC3, pH 7.0; 2 = HTC3, pH
9.5; 3 = HTC2, pH 9.5; and 4 = HTC1, pH 9.5.

The EXAFS of all samples was dominated by a central sinusoidal
wave function, which, in the corresponding radial structure functions
(RSFs) (Figure 2a,b),
led to a dominant peak near 1.4 Å (U–Oyl scattering,
Δr + r uncorrected for phase
shift). An equatorial ligand shell (Oeq) around uranyl
was modeled at distances of ∼2.35 and 2.50 Å for all samples.
Neither the distances nor the coordination numbers of Oeq atoms were significantly different among the CO2r samples
(N ± 21%, R ± 3% or 0.07
Å, see Table S5 for EXAFS accuracy
determinations), which were distinct because of the interference of
a prominent beatnode between 6 and 9 Å–1 (Figure 2a). The beatnode
arises from U–C photoelectron scattering (∼2.85–2.90
Å) due to carbonate ligands coordinating the central uranyl moiety.
Nonlinear least-square shell fits (Table S6) confirmed the presence of 1.5 to 2.3 CO3 ligands (±10%)
in the first ligand shell of UO22+ at a distance
of 2.88–2.91 Å. Thus, 1.5–1.6 C atoms in the HTC3-pH9.5
and HTC2-pH9.5 samples can be considered significantly fewer than
that in the HTC3-pH7.0 and HTC1-pH9.5 samples (NC–U ≈ 2.2–2.3). Coordination numbers smaller
than 3 suggest the presence of binary mixtures between free uranyl,
mono-, bis-, and tris-carbonate species35 (Table S8).

transform (FT) magnitude and the dashed lines the extracted imaginary
part.

Carbonate ions did not coordinate
uranyl in the CO2p
samples and produced a concomitant smaller FT magnitude of shells
between 1.8 and 2.8 Å (r + Δr, uncorrected for phase shift) in the CO2p RSFs (Figure 2b). The ligand environment
of Oeq atoms between CO2p spectra differed significantly
in the number of next-nearest O neighbors and appeared more disordered
than their CO2r counterparts. Fewer Oeq atoms
(4.2 ± 0.9) were present in the HTC3-pH7.0 sample than in the
HTC3-pH9.5 sample (7.2 ± 1.5) or the HTC2-pH9.5 sample (6.0 ±
1.3, Table S7). The magnitude of the Debye–Waller
parameter (σ) of the fit for HTC3-pH9.5 reflected the greater
disorder (unconstrained ∼0.015 Å2) in the CO2p coprecipitation system. When fixed σ to 0.012 Å2 (e.g., σ for cejkaite 1) or 0.007 Å2 (e.g., σ for ruthefordine and HTC2-pH9.5, CO2p),
however, the summed NOeq dropped
to 5.9–7.2, which is well within established accuracies for
a sixfold coordinated equatorial ligand environment. Despite these
differences in the coordination number, U–Oeq bond
lengths were similar between the CO2p samples and not substantially
different from their CO2r counterparts at ∼2.32
and ∼2.50 Å (Table S7). No
evidence could be found for the formation of schoepite despite the
slight oversaturated state of the initial conditions of the HTC3 CO2p (pH 7.0) sample reacted with 10 μM uranyl at pH 7.0.

Second Shells and Higher Order Bonding Environments
The
second shell bonding environments of the adsorption, HTC3, samples
did not differ as a function of pH or due to the presence of CO2. Depending on the Mg/Al–O, U–Oeq, and O–O edge distances, interatomic distances for single-edge
(1E) and double-edge (2E) sharing configurations
will occur between 3.13 and 3.85 Å (Table S9). All of the adsorption samples show the presence of ∼0.5
Mg/Al neighbors at 3.21 Å and ∼1.0–1.5 Mg/Al neighbors
at 3.38 Å (Tables S6 and S7). Arai
et al.35 fitted next-nearest Al neighbors
at 3.30 Å on imogolite, an amorphous aluminosilicate mineral,
whereas Hennig et al.36 modeled next-nearest
Al neighbors at 3.40–3.45 Å on montmorillonite, a generally
poorly crystalline 2:1 type aluminosilicate. The magnitude of the
coordination numbers (±20%, Tables S6 and S7) of Mg/Al neighbors suggests that single-edge (1E) and double-edge (2E) sharing complexes are formed in
approximately 1:1 to 1:2 ratio (1E/2E) and that
the presence of CO3 in the ligand shell of uranyl did not
inhibit the formation of these surface complexes.

The second
shell and other higher order bonding environments of the coprecipitated
samples (HTC1 and HTC2) were substantially more complex. Second shells
appeared to have shifted away from the central absorber in the RSFs
to ∼3.50 to 4.10 Å (r + Δr, uncorrected for phase shift, Figure 2). The EXAFS fit of the simplest precipitates,
HTC2 CO2r (pH 9.5) and HTC1 CO2p (pH 9.5), was
similar to the bonding environments of the adsorption samples (HTC3)
with an additional Mg/Al neighbor near 3.60–3.65 Å (Tables S6 and S7). Coordination numbers ranged
between 0.3 and 0.6 for Mg/Al neighbors near 3.20 and 3.65 Å
and between 1.3 and 1.8 for the Mg/Al neighbor at ∼3.37 Å
which are too high to consider that three different surface species
(2 × 1E + 1 × 2E) are present. Instead,
the magnitude of the coordination numbers suggests that uranyl moieties
are surrounded at the surface by Al/Mg(OH)6 octahedra to
different extents having between two and five next-nearest Mg/Al neighbors.
If we consider a binary solution of the HTC2 CO2r sample
with 1.6 C atoms as part of the first ligand shell and a ∼50/50
mixture between uranyl tris-carbonate and CO3-free uranyl(hydroxide)
moieties (Table S8), the latter would hence
appear to be coordinated by 4–5 Mg/Al neighbors (2 × 0.5
+ 2 × 1.3 + 2 × 0.5 = 4.6, ±20%, see Table S9). A similar bonding environment, containing less
C atoms, appears to be present in the HTC1 CO2p sample,
however, as a mixture of 1E, 2E, and partially
surrounded uranyl complexes (Table S7).
It should be mentioned that while no meaningful fits were observed
when the distance at 3.60–3.65 Å was modeled with the
linear O–U–O–U multiple scattering path,37 some of the EXAFS signals may have been nevertheless
contributed by this type of photoelectron scattering (Figure S4).

The two remaining coprecipitates,
HTC2 CO2p and HTC1
CO2r, presented the most complex EXAFS signals, likely
because of (partial) cancellation effects between many different U–Mg/Al/U,
multiple scattering events and uranyl adsorption on aragonite (HTC1
CO2r). Magnesium/Al shells at 3.20 and 3.37 Å could
not be fitted in these samples, resulting in either negative coordination
numbers, Debye–Waller parameters, or both. The ΔR2 segments shifted away in distance from the
central absorber and, in the case of HTC2 CO2p, was split
into two ΔR2 segments (a and b, Table S7). Tentatively, the fitted data for HTC2
CO2p may show a well-incorporated uranyl moiety in the
HTC structure, but this interpretation is problematic because of the
persistence of the trans-, di-oxo moiety of uranyl (see Results and Discussion below) as seen in the XANES spectra.
More distal (>4.0 Å) neighbors may represent either Mg/Al
or
O neighbors in the HTC structure (the fit shown in Table S7 used U–Mg/Al scattering paths). HTC1 CO2r was the only sample in which a next-nearest U neighbor may
have been present at 3.90 Å alongside Mg/Al at 3.61 and 3.72,
and 3.90 Å being similar to the interatomic U–U distance
in schoepite and clarkeite (both near 3.96 Å). The presence of
aragonite, a phase concomitantly formed during HTC1 precipitation
in the CO2r atmosphere, combined with uranyl’s affinity
for aragonite,33 complicates the interpretation
of the EXAFS further. The fit results of these latter two coprecipitates
should hence be cautiously interpreted to show one or more (possibly
many) bonding environments; however, the spectra are probably too
complex (and noisy) for a nonlinear least-square shell fit approach
to be conclusive. It is also quite possible that the EXAFS captured
an intermediate, still evolving state which only over time will reveal
a more distinct bonding environment; long(er)-term kinetic studies
would be required to substantiate this. Structural evolution of precipitates
can be explained through Ostwald ripening, for example, Gräfe
and Sparks38 have shown that zinc arsenate
precipitates on goethite do not assume a stable coordination environment
until several months after the reaction. Lead (Pb(II)) will nucleate
only over time into hydroxide precipitates on oxide surfaces.39

Uranyl Bonding Mechanism I: Coprecipitation
(HTC1 and HTC2)
The basic building blocks of the HTC structure
are near-perfect
octahedra of Mg(OH)64– and Al(OH)63– which present two O–O edge lengths.
These can be simply defined as “bonding” and “nonbonding”
(Figures 3 and S5). The bonding O–O edge lengths (2.664
Å) run perpendicular to the chain of edge sharing octahedral
units, whereas the nonbonding O–O edges (3.054 Å) run
parallel to it and reflect the interatomic Mg/Al–Mg/Al distances
(Figures 3 and S5). The U L-III XANES spectra show that the
uranyl symmetry, that is, the trans-, di-oxo O=U=O bridge,
was not lost in the coprecipitation samples HTC1 and HTC2. This creates
distinct steric restrictions on the ability of (UO2)(Oeq)n to complement (or become incorporated
into) the HTC structure because the apical, double-bonded O atoms
are not shared with other polyhedra—including structures such
as schoepite or clarkeite.40,41 Recently, several research
groups42−45 have shown that uranyl can be successfully incorporated into goethite
(α-FeOOH), when U abandons the actinyl symmetry and assumes
approximately octahedral symmetry. This is made possible when U6+ is reduced to U5+, for example, by Fe2+, and is immediately stabilized by other Fe2+/3+ octahedra.
In the present study, only the synthesis of HTC1 contained potential
electron donors for U6+ to reduce to U5+, whereas
the HTC2 precipitation system did not. Hence, U incorporation into
HTC2 in any of the present experiments is implausible, but some degree
of Al/Mg(OH)6surrounding (without incorporating)
a surface uranyl moiety appears plausible based on the XANES and EXAFS
data presented here (HTC2 CO2r, HTC1 CO2p).
Such a surface complex would have distinctly limiting effects on the
crystal growth and expansion in the ab plane of the
HTC.

Figure 3 Presentation of 1E and 2E surface adsorption
complexes of uranyl on HTCs. The 2E surface complex is
most likely formed in kink sites where coordination to more than one
Mg/Al octahedron would be possible. Oxygen atoms in the equatorial
plane of uranyl may be part of a carbonate ligand shell. The apical/actinyl
O atoms (Oyl) are shown in red.

The adsorption of uranyl to surface sites therefore had to
have
two effects on HTC formation: (1) an interference effect if uranyl
adsorbed on the bonding O–O edges or (2) a limited effect if
uranyl adsorbed to the nonbonding O–O edge. Of the four precipitation
systems studied here, the (012) and (120) reflections of HTC1s and
HTC2 CO2p diffraction patterns (Figure S2) indicate that the expansion of the precipitates in the ab plane was limited. The diffraction pattern of the HTC2
CO2r sample, however, displays well-resolved (110, 113)
reflections compared to its CO2p counterpart indicative
of less restricted crystal growth despite a similar extent of U retention
(Table S3). Crystallite size calculations
using the Scherrer equation confirmed that the HTC2 CO2r sample (∼366 nm) was approximately five times larger than
the HTC2 CO2p sample (∼72 nm), further suggesting
that complexation by CO3 effectively inhibited uranyl from
binding to the HTC growth sites (bonding O–O edges) while permitting
its reaction at nonbonding O–O edges. Indeed, the U–Mg/Al
distances at 3.47 and 3.71 Å (Table S7) suggest that the surface complexation at the 2.664 Å O–O
bonding edge with both the shorter (2.29 Å) and longer (2.49
Å) U–Oeq ligands (Table S9) involved leads to a significant interference effect on
HTC formation. The U–Mg/Al distances observed in the HTC3 (CO2r) samples and the HTC2 CO2r and HTC1 CO2r samples all indicate that uranyl adsorption occurred predominantly
on the nonbonding O–O edge involving partial ligand exchange
(O/OH for CO3). This ligand exchange is likely favored
by the presence of SO4/NO3 in the interlayer,
which would be exchangeable and thus consume carbonate released from
uranyl (mono-, bis-, and tris-carbonates) and OH ions during inner-sphere
complexation; such a reaction would thus favor not only the formation
of the surface complex but also the concomitant SO42–/2NO3––CO32–/OH– anion exchange.26 We therefore propose (Schemes S1 and S2, Supporting Information) that the partial exchange
of CO3–SO4 and OH–NO3 should result in a net entropy increase because of the greater number
of ligands in the interlayer and in solution. These proposed reaction
pathways agree with previous thermodynamic and kinetic studies, indicating
a significant entropy increase (113–149 J/(mol·K)) of
an endothermic reaction (25–28 J/mol: SO4–CO3 exchange46) between uranyl and
HTC, and would be approximately consistent with the observed pseudo-second-order
reaction kinetics5,8,10 and
incomplete anion exchange.47

Uranyl Bonding
Mechanism II: Surface Complexation (HTC3)
Surface adsorption
of negatively charged uranyl carbonates would
have been favorable under the reaction conditions because of the positive,
pH-dependent surface charge of the LDH; the point of zero charge of
HTC is approximately 12.2,28 although it
may vary substantially with composition (e.g., to as low as pH 9.248) which needs to be considered in the context
of the polymetallic barren lixiviant samples. Schemes S1–S4 show proposed surface adsorption mechanisms
of different uranyl species, which depend on pH (7.0 vs 9.5) and the
presence/absence of CO2; scheme S1 uses uranyl bis-carbonate (UO2(CO3)22–) as the initial species because this species
would be dominant under normal atmospheric conditions. In CO2r suspensions, uranyl will occur dominantly as
the tris-carbonate species at pH 7.0 and 9.5 (Figure S1). A bis-carbonate complex at pH 7.0 does not necessarily
have to undergo OH–CO3 ligand exchange to form an 1E complex (scheme S1a,b); however,
coordinated water molecules may become deprotonated in an initial
step (scheme S1a) if they are not exchanged
for surface-OH in the subsequent one (scheme S1b). The resulting 2H+ would be neutralized by the ligand-exchange
reaction between surface- and uranyl-OHs, resulting one way or another
in 2H2O. The 2E complex for the same reaction
conditions, however, requires the exchange of at least one CO3 for OH and possibly the deprotonation of two coordinated
water molecules of uranyl (scheme S1c).
This reaction yields H+ and HCO3 ions in solution,
in which the H+ is neutralized by the release of 3OH ions
during the subsequent OH ligand exchange between uranyl and the surface
yielding H2O, 2OH, and HCO3 ions in solution.
The OH and HCO3 ions may possibly exchange for NO3 and SO4 in the interlayer; however, there is no prior
research that has established the affinity of HCO3 relative
to SO4, NO3, or OH in the HTC interlayer. At
pH 9.5 (CO2r), CO3–OH ligand exchange
as an initial reaction step (scheme S2a) would be obligatory for either 1E or 2E surface
complexes to form (scheme S2b). The release
of CO32– ions into solution would provoke
subsequent SO4/NO3–CO3/OH
exchange of interlayer anions (scheme S2c). Adsorbed uranyl species at pH 7.0 (CO2r) were coordinated
by ∼2.3 carbonate ligands, which was surprisingly higher than
that at pH 9.5 (NU–C ≈ 1.5)
but is consistent with the dominant UO2(CO3)34– species in solution at pH 7.0 and 1 atm
of CO2 (Figure S1).

At
pH 7.0 (CO2p), UO2(OH)2 (3%), UO2(OH)+ (3%), (UO2)3(OH)5+ (74%), and (UO2)4(OH)7+ (20%) make up soluble uranyl species.49 Although the initial concentration of uranyl
nitrate was slightly supersaturated with respect to schoepite (S.I.
≈ 0.22), no evidence was observed for its formation nor for
the formation of polynuclear uranyl species (e.g., (UO2)3(OH)5+ or (UO2)4(OH)7+). Scheme S3 relates the adsorption mechanism of the dominant (UO2)3(OH)5+ species at pH 7.0
undergoing depolymerization into neutral UO2(OH)20 (aq) species before
adsorbing to the HTC surface as 1E and/or 2E
surface complexes. Reaction (scheme S3a) is probably driven by the adsorption of the neutral, UO2(OH)20 (aq,
3%), fraction on HTC as the dominant (UO2)3(OH)5+ and (UO2)4(OH)7+ species would be expected to be repelled by the positive
surface charge. Six or seven H2O molecules are generated
in the reaction as a result of 1E or 2E surface
complex formation (with four equatorial OH ligands according to the
EXAFS models), respectively, and the associated H2O–OH
ligand-exchange reactions of uranyl (assumed to be initially sixfold
coordinated in the equatorial plane) and the surface. At pH 9.5 (CO2p, scheme S4), UO2(OH)3– (66%), (UO2)3(OH)7– (31%), and UO2(OH)20 (3%) are the three
dominant uranyl species.49 Being negatively
charged, the first two species are expected to be attracted to the
positively charged surface where ligand exchange would subsequently
result in 1E and 2E surface complexes (scheme S4a,b). Previous research5,6,50 has shown that U adsorption does
not decline until the point of zero charge of HTC is approached with
the extent of adsorption not being significantly different between
pH 7.0 and 9.5, which is consistent with the findings of this work.

The modeled bonding environments, specifically of the first ligand
shell, have provided important insights into the potential reaction
mechanism(s) of the surface/interlayer reactions and are significant
in the context of many previous sorption studies of uranyl with minerals
of pH-dependent surface charge (e.g., ferrihydrite) at neutral to
alkaline pH and the presence of carbonate ligands.35,51−53 These previous studies have shown that adsorption
declines significantly with an increase of uranyl carbonate species,
whereas in HTC suspensions, the sorption reaction is probably limited
by the point of zero charge but not uranyl speciation. The critical
difference between HTC and ferrihydrite sequestration is the anion-exchange
reaction (SO4–CO3 and NO3–OH)
in the final reaction steps shown in Schemes S1 and S2. Catalano and Brown,53 however,
have also shown that uranyl carbonate species will bond at Fe sites
of montmorillonite surfaces while retaining between 0.6 and 1.5 CO3 moieties. HTC removed uranyl from solution very effectively,
even at the low concentrations tested here. Removal was largely complete
whether the HTC formed in situ or was applied as an adsorbent. In
the absence of a reductant, it is unlikely that uranyl could be properly
incorporated into the HTC structure because of the steric constraints
posed by the trans-, di-oxo, O=U=O moiety. Uranyl adsorption
to the HTC–water interface did not appear to be limited by
the presence of excess carbonate ligands, probably because of favorable
anion exchange with interlayer NO3 and SO4.
Future studies should consider the potential role of reductants such
as Mn(II), Fe(II), or Co(II) to reduce U(VI) to U(V) to break the
actinyl symmetry that hinders the incorporation of U into HTC and
thereby (potentially) form a (more) stable repository material. In
this respect, time-dependent EXAFS and XRD studies could provide valuable
information into the long-term fate of uranium and HTC both from a
contaminant (U) and from a mineral (HTC) perspective. The selectivity
sequence of Cl–, NO3–, OH–, and HCO3– should
be established to understand differences in CO32– versus HCO3– selectivity in HTC/LDH
interlayers.

Experimental Section
HTC Precipitation
Three distinct types of HTC were
prepared for the purpose of this study (Table S1). Type 1 HTC (HTC1) represented an industrially relevant
HTC product that was synthesized from the barren lixiviant of the
Beverley North U mine under a CO2-enriched (CO2r) or CO2-depleted/CO2-poor (N2,
CO2p) headspace (details of the barren lixiviant composition
are provided in Table S2 of the Supporting Information section) with NaOH addition for a final pH of 9.5 (initial pH of
the reaction was 1.3). Type 2 HTCs (HTC2) were also precipitated under
a CO2r or CO2p headspace from a solution containing
110.7 mmol/L MgSO4, 36.9 mmol/L Al(NO3)3, and 19.0 μmol/L uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)2) with an initial pH of 2.8. HTC2s represent
the controlled, synthetic counterparts to HTC1, thereby avoiding the
potential complications of multiple polyvalent cationic species and
calcium contamination. HTC1 and HTC2 were aged for 13 days at 358
K, with intermittent swirling, pH readjustment, and refilling of the
synthesis vessels’ headspace with the appropriate gas (CO2 or N2, respectively). In all cases, the headspace
volume was approximately equal to the solution volume.

HTC3
samples were precipitated in the absence of UO22+ from 30 mmol MgSO4 and 10 mmol Al(NO3)3 in 1 L of doubly deionized (DDI) water. The pH was adjusted
to 9.5 using NaOH, and the suspensions were allowed to age at 358
K. The pH was checked after 8 days but found unchanged. After 15 days,
the solids were washed twice in DDI water, solids were allowed to
gravity settle, the supernatant was decanted, and the suspended solids
were divided into four weight-equivalent portions for UO22+ adsorption tests.

UO22+ Adsorption Tests
The pH
of each HTC3 suspension was adjusted to either pH 7.0 or 9.5 with
H2SO4 or NaOH solution (ca. 10 M) as required
(see also Table S1). CO2 (CO2r) or N2 (CO2p) gas was bubbled into
the suspensions for ca. 10 min before the final pH adjustment was
made. To each test, 52 μL of 25 mM UO2(NO3)2 solution was added. This produced an equivalent HTC/UO22+ ratio in the adsorption tests as in the HTC2
samples; however, conditions in the HTC3 CO2p sample at
pH 7.0 were thus slightly supersaturated (S.I. ≈ 0.22) with
respect to schoepite ([UO2]8O2(OH)12[H2O]12). The pH of these suspensions
was regularly rechecked and adjusted as necessary; the flask headspaces
were refilled with the designated gas, loosely capped, and swirled
occasionally while the samples aged at 358 K for 2 days.

At
the end of their respective aging periods, the solids from HTC1, 2,
and 3 were separated from their synthesis liquors by centrifugation,
and a supernatant sample was taken to determine the concentrations
of Al, Mg, and U in solution by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
and to calculate the composition of the HTC solids (Table S3). The solids were washed with DDI water, shock-frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and freeze-dried until in powder form for XRD
and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy analyses.

XRD and XAFS Data Collection
Randomized powder samples
of freeze-dried HTC1, 2, and 3 were prepared on zero-background slide
holders and patterns collected on an Empyrean PANalytical X-ray diffractometer
in a Bragg–Brentano mode with monochromatic Co Kα radiation.
The patterns were indexed against the published HTC structures,18−20 and the unit cell parameters were calculated from the fitted peak
positions (WinXAS (v3.121)) of the (003),
(006), and (012) reflections (Table S4).

Dry, randomly oriented powders of HTC1, 2, and 3 were sealed into
thin, steel sample holders with a X-ray transparent Kapton tape for
XAFS measurements in fluorescence mode (CANBERRA germanium detector)
on the 1.9 T wiggler XAS beamline (12IDB, section 9) at the Australian
Synchrotron (Melbourne, VIC). Between 2 and 4 scans per sample were
collected to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (additional details
of the XAS data collection are provided in the Supporting Information section).

XAFS Data Interpretation
Standard XAFS data reduction
procedures were applied as detailed in ref (22) using the programs Average (v2.0.6, energy corrections)
and WinXAS (v3.121), including inspection
of beam damage, glitch removal, background correction, normalization,
averaging, and EXAFS fitting. Spectra were converted from energy (keV)
to wavevector (k) space (Å–1) by assigning the binding energy, E0, to the main inflection in the U L-III X-ray absorption edge. The
oscillatory motion of the EXAFS was extracted using a cubic spline
function of ≤7 knots over an average k-range
of ∼2.4–14.6 Å–1. Radial structure
functions (RSFs) were calculated using a forward Fourier transform
(FT) over a range of 3.20–14.50 Å–1 and
a Bessel windowing function (β = 4). Nonlinear least-square
shell fits were performed after applying a back Fourier transform
(BFT) over a specific range (ΔR) in the RSF.
The first segment (ΔR1) comprises
the axial and equatorial ligand shells to approximately 2.50 Å
(R + ΔR, uncorrected for phase
shift) in CO2p and up to 2.90 Å in CO2r
samples to include contributions from U–C photoelectron scattering.
The second BFT segment (ΔR2) ranged
from ca. 2.90 to 3.45 Å for HTC3 samples and up to 4.10 Å
(R + ΔR, uncorrected for phase
shift) for HTC1 and HTC2 samples to model contributions from U–Al/Mg
and U–U photoelectron scattering. The phase-shift parameter
(ΔE0) was correlated among all scattering
paths to the same value and varied freely during the calculation,
and the amplitude reduction factor (S02) was fixed to 1.0 for all samples. The number of permissible
free-floating parameters was determined from the extended Stern equation
(Ndpi = (2 × Δk × ΔR/π) + 223) as applied in WinXAS (see further details regarding EXAFS
modeling in the Supporting Information section).
