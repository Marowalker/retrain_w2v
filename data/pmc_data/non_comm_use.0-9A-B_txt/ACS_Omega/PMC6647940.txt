This study proposes a novel approach
to the use of brown carbon
(BrC) absorption spectra as a tool to understand their broader composition
and characteristics. The ratios of absorption coefficient (babs) spectra over a wavelength range (310–600
nm) for water-soluble and methanol-soluble BrC were used to quantify
the relative contribution of water-soluble and water-insoluble chromophores
to total BrC. The same ratios for the samples collected during the
day versus night were used to assess the diurnal variability in BrC
composition and concentrations. Ratios of babs at different wavelengths with respect to that at 365 nm were used
to understand whether BrC is predominantly composed of one type of
chromophore, that is, humic-like substances, or different chromophores
(e.g., nitroaromatic compounds) with the understanding that different
chromophores absorb predominantly at different wavelengths. As a case
study, day/night pairs of PM2.5 samples collected from
Patiala (30.33°N, 76.4°E) during paddy residue burning were
used, and results are discussed. A majority of BrC from paddy residue
burning were found to be water-insoluble, and the fraction of water-soluble
BrC to total BrC showed a decreasing trend with increasing wavelength.
During the burning period, night-time water-soluble nitrogenous organic
species were found to be more absorbing than daytime water-soluble
nitrogenous species. The proposed method will be very useful for BrC
studies over the globe.

1 Introduction
Carbonaceous aerosol consists
of organic matter (OM) and black
carbon (BC). BC is known to exert a strong warming effect on global
and regional climate.1 Some assessments
suggest that the positive radiative forcing by BC is second only to
carbon dioxide.2 Recent studies found that
certain types of organic carbon (OC), termed “brown carbon
(BrC)”, also absorb radiation efficiently in near-ultraviolet
(UV) and visible regions and contribute ∼35% to direct radiative
forcing by carbonaceous aerosol.3 BrC is
a light-absorbing part of OC and characterized by an absorption spectrum
that smoothly increases from the visible to UV wavelengths.4−7 Sources of BrC in the atmosphere are a variety of primary emissions
and secondary formation processes.7,8 The primary
sources of BrC are incomplete combustion of fossil fuels (related
to traffic), industrial processes, domestic heating, and biomass burning
(BB).7 Further, several laboratory chamber
experiments and ambient measurements showed the formation of secondary
BrC chromophores through various mechanisms such as photo-oxidation
of aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozonolysis of terpenes,
and subsequent aging in the presence of ammonium ions and humidity.9−14 Emissions from BB are shown to be a large source of primary BrC
as well as precursors of secondary BrC on regional and global scales.15−19 Atmospheric humic-like substances (HULIS), major primary BrC, are
an important fraction in organic aerosol.20

A BrC consists of a variety of organic compounds with different
absorbing characteristics. It is very difficult to identify individual
BrC species and their optical properties, and therefore, they are
often presented as the absorption coefficient at a certain wavelength.
Furthermore, optical properties of BrC are reported to change with
various atmospheric processes such as oxidation, solar irradiation,
and changes in temperature and relative humidity.13,21,22 These factors result in highly variable
composition and concentration of BrC in time and space, which in turn
results in substantial uncertainties in predicting their climate effects.23

This paper mainly focuses on the use of
BrC spectra of water-soluble
and methanol-soluble OC as a tool to understand their broader composition
and optical characteristics as well as to assess the relative contribution
of water-soluble and water-insoluble BrC to total BrC.

2 Materials and Methods
As a case study for the proposed approach,
particulate matter smaller
than 2.5 μm aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) samples
were used. The sampling site was located on the terrace of the Department
of Physics, Punjabi University, Patiala (30.33°N, 76.4°E,
250 m above mean sea level), a semi-urban city surrounded by agricultural
area within a few kilometers. Patiala is situated in the northwestern
part of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Day/night (10 h integration time)
pairs of ambient PM2.5 samples (n = 69)
were collected every day before (n = 21), during
(n = 36), and after (n = 8) a large-scale
paddy residue burning from October to November 2014. The samples were
collected on precombusted (at 450 °C for 10–12 h) Tissuquartz
filters (PALLFLEX, 25 × 20 cm2) using a high-volume
air sampler (Thermo-Anderson, HVS) with the flow rate of ∼1.13
m3 min–1. Soon after their collection,
the filters were wrapped in aluminum foils, sealed in plastic ziplock
bags, and stored in a deep freezer (−19 °C) until the
time of analysis. Further, a wide variety of chemical species were
analyzed in these filters. They included water-soluble OC (WSOC) and
water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON = water-soluble total nitrogen–inorganic
nitrogen (IN), where IN is the sum of NH4+–N
and NO3––N), and were analyzed
using a TOC–TN analyzer (Shimadzu, model-TOC–LCPH with
AS–L autosampler). Elemental carbon (EC) and OC were analyzed
with the EC–OC analyzer (Sunset Inc), and inorganic cations
(NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) and anions (Cl–,
NO3–, and SO42–) were analyzed using ion chromatography (Dionex, ICS-5000). A detailed
description of analytical procedures is given elsewhere.24−26 Gas-phase markers such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides
(NOx = NO + NO2) were measured
using gas analyzers (Ecotech Serinus) with 2 min integration time.

For BrC spectra, a 3 cm2 punch of sample filters was
extracted with water, and another 1.5 cm2 punch with methanol
using ultrasonication. The extract was introduced into the liquid
waveguide capillary cell (World Precision Instrument, Sarasota, FL,
2 m path length) coupled to a portable UV–visible spectrophotometer
(model USB-4000) and deuterium and tungsten halogen lamps (DT-Mini-2,
Ocean Optics) via a syringe filter (Acrodisc Syringe filters with
GHP Membrane, 0.45 μm, 25 mm) to remove insoluble particles
(including BC and dust), and the high-resolution absorption spectra
were saved from 300 to 700 nm for each filter extract using a portable
UV–visible spectrophotometer. A spectrum of water extracts
was referenced with water and that of methanol extracts with methanol
to remove any possible effect of absorbance from solvent on the observed
spectrum of samples. This also enables one to compare the spectra
of different solvents. Several blank filters were also treated like
samples, and reported values are corrected for blanks. The analysis
of about 20% samples was also repeated for absorption spectra and
found to be within 8%. The detailed analytical protocol for the assessment
of optical properties of BrC was described elsewhere.27,28 The absorption coefficient at a given wavelength (babs_λ) was estimated as follows: 1  Here, Aλ is the absorbance at wavelength λ, A700 is an absorbance at the reference wavelength
(700 nm) to
account for any baseline drift, Vext =
volume of water (or methanol) used for the extraction of the aerosol
filter punch, Va = volume of air filtered
during sampling, and l = path length (2 m).

3 Results
The PM2.5 concentration ranged from
∼90 to 500
μg m–3 during the study period with the average
values of 154 ± 57, 271 ± 122, and 156 ± 18 μg
m–3 during pre-burning (T1: 11th–22nd October, n = 25), burning (T2: 23rd October to 10th November, n = 36), and post-burning (T3: 12th–15th
November, n = 8) periods, respectively, reflecting
the effect of BB on ambient PM2.5 concentrations. For the
total daytime PM2.5 samples, the contributions of OM (2.1
times the measured concentration of OC, Rajput and Sarin, 2014)29 were 36, 46, and 46%; water-soluble inorganic
species (WSIS = sum of NH4+ + Na+ + K+ + Mg2+ + Ca2+ + Cl– + NO3– + SO42–) were 14, 41, and 15%; and EC were 5, 4, and 5%, during T1, T2, and T3, respectively. Similarly, for nighttime samples,
the contributions of OM were 46, 63, and 46%; WSIS were 11, 13, and
18%; and EC were 5, 3, and 5% during T1, T2, and T3, respectively. The observation suggests that OM was dominating in
all the three periods, and nighttime OM concentrations were always
higher than those observed during the daytime. Similar observations
were reported by Rastogi et al. (2014)26 from the same sampling site. Highest OM concentrations (OM ≈
63%) were observed in nighttime samples collected during T2 period, and they were slightly higher compared to the
previously reported value (OM ≈ 56%).26

3.1 Proposed Concept of Using BrC Spectra to Assess
Their Composition and Characteristics
BrC species may consist
of a variety of organic chromophores with variable concentrations
and different absorbing characteristics. The absorption coefficient
(babs) spectra of water extracts or methanol
extracts of aerosol represent the bulk optical property of water-soluble
or methanol-soluble (assumed to be total) BrC, respectively, as a
function of wavelength. If the BrC composition is uniform from sample
to sample, then the ratio of babs spectra
for different samples shall be uniform (constant) as a function of
wavelength. The magnitude of this constant would suggest the relative
abundance of BrC chromophores in different samples. However, if the
BrC composition is not uniform from sample to sample, then one would
expect variable ratio at different wavelengths depending on the change
in composition and concentrations of different chromophores. It is
known that different types of chromophores absorb strongly at different
wavelengths, for example, HULIS-type BrC (usually primary BrC) absorbs
strongly at around 365 nm, whereas nitroaromatic-type BrC (usually
secondary BrC) absorbs strongly at a relatively higher wavelength
(>400 nm).12,20,23,30−34 The wavelengths at which non-uniformity in babs spectra ratio is observed would indicate
the change in the type of BrC in a given sample. It is relevant to
state here that the proposed method is not the replacement of doing
molecular speciation of BrC, but it shall be very useful in understanding
the possible dominant BrC species present in a given sample.

Further, the same concept can be applied to water extracts and methanol
extracts of the same sample. One can calculate the ratio of babs at different wavelengths for water extract
to that for methanol extract and use it to quantify the relative contribution
of water-soluble and water-insoluble chromophores to total BrC as
a function of wavelength in a given sample presuming that methanol-soluble
BrC represents total BrC, which is a valid assumption as per literature.31,35,36 These concepts are used in the
subsequent sections on the samples collected from Patiala as a case
study.

3.2 BrC Composition and Characteristics through babs Spectra
Figure 1 shows a comparison of the babs spectra for BrC extracted with water (babs_Water) and methanol (babs_Methanol). They exhibit very different light absorption properties during
the T2 period compared to those observed
during the T1 and T3 periods. The variability in the night/day (N/D) ratio of babs_Water spectra during the T2 period was large compared to those observed during the T1 and T3 periods
(Figure 2a–c).
The observation during T2 suggests that
BB emits a variety of BrC chromophores with the highest concentrations
of chromophores absorbing in 310–400 nm range. Magnitudes of
N/D ratio were always >1, with highest values during T2 (1.8–3) followed by T3 (1.3–1.5) and T1 (1–1.3)
over 310–600 nm range, reflecting the changes in composition
and concentrations of BrC chromophores which absorb at different wavelengths.
Here, the absolute magnitude reflects the N/D change in chromophore
concentrations, and the variability in magnitude indicates the N/D
change in composition, as conceptualized in Section 3.1. During T1 and T3, a slightly lower N/D ratio with
mild but noticeable variability in 450–600 nm range is
suggestive of the presence of daytime secondary BrC in water extracts.
The babs_Water showed a sharp increase
in absorption at 310–400 nm range during the nights of T2 period, which is likely due to HULIS from
BB.15,28,30 In the same
set of samples, a low absorption at >500 nm was also noticed, which
was not observed during the T1 and T3 periods. Similar spectra were observed by
Xie et al.33 for the laboratory-generated
secondary BrC formed by the reaction between benzene and m-cresol under high NOx conditions.33 Further, a spectral enhancement was observed
in 410–490 nm range of babs_Water during the T2 period (as reflected in
N/D ratio, Figure 1b). This observation suggests that the observed spectral band was
likely associated with the presence of a variety of absorbing nitrogenous
organic species, which were likely generated through secondary organic
aerosol (SOA) in the presence of NOx.33 High NOx was also
observed in this study during the T2 period
(figure not shown). This inference is attested by a significant correlation
(r2 = 0.55) between WSON/WSOC ratio and
absorption coefficient measured at 450 nm for water extracts (babs_450_Water) in the samples collected during
nighttime of T2 period (Figure 2b). Higher WSON/WSOC is an
indicative of a larger fraction of water-soluble nitrogenous organic
species in the total water-soluble organic species. Further, absorbing
properties of nitrogenous organic species in samples collected during
daytime and nighttime were likely different, as for similar WSON/WSOC
ratios, the babs_450_Water values were
very different (Figure 2a,b). Daytime WSON/WSOC ratios were also poorly correlated with babs_450_Water (Figure 2a). Satish et al.22 also documented that absorbing nitrogenous species are volatile
and/or photosensitive, and therefore, their abundance reduces during
daytime.

Figure 1 babs spectra during day and night and
their N/D ratio for water-soluble BrC during (a) pre-burning (T1), (b) during burning (T2), and (c) during post-burning (T3) periods, and for methanol-soluble BrC during (d) pre-burning (T1), (e) during burning (T2), and (f) during post-burning (T3) periods. Note that y-axis range is different for
the figures (a–c) and (d–f).

Figure 2 Linear relationship between WSON to WSOC ratio and absorption coefficient
at 450 nm for water extracts (babs_450_Water) in (a) daytime samples and (b) nighttime samples. Higher nighttime
WSON/WSOC ratios were associated with higher babs_450_Water, suggesting that nighttime nitrogenous compounds
were more absorbing.

A recent study by Cheng et al.36 suggested
that majority (∼85%) of organic compounds in the ambient PM
could be methanol-soluble. In the present study, the average WSOC/OC
ratio is about 0.60, that is, ∼40% of OC is water-insoluble. Figure 1d–f shows
the babs spectra and their N/D ratio for
methanol extracts during T1, T2, and T3, respectively. The babs_Methanol values were much higher than the babs_Water values, suggesting that water-insoluble
BrC species are relatively more absorbing during all the three periods.
During T2, both babs_Water and babs_Methanol show
higher values in shorter-wavelength range (310–400 nm); however, babs_Methanol showed the higher value in the
visible region too (Figure 1e). This observation suggests that babs_Methanol contains a significant fraction of water-insoluble
chromophores which can absorb radiation in the visible region. This
can be ascribed to differences in solubility of the chromophores in
water and methanol.16,37,38 Some studies suggest that the molecules comprising more aromatic
rings (i.e., a higher degree of conjugation) have higher absorption
that extends to longer wavelengths.34 Further,
Zhang et al. (2013)37 had documented BrC
chemical speciation, which showed that larger molecular weight polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) absorbed more toward the visible range
and have lower solubility in water. Sun et al.35 suggested two kinds of OC: a water-soluble organic mixture
with some UV–visible absorption and a water-insoluble OC with
higher absorption.16,30 Further, quinoid compounds are
strong candidates for such absorption.35 This type of absorption spectra was present in the nights of the T2 period; however, it disappeared in day samples
(Figure 1b,e). This
could be due to various reasons such as the evaporation of higher-volatility
compounds (e.g., nitrophenols), photobleaching, and so forth. A similar
observation is reported in Lin et al.,40 which suggests that the decrease in absorbance does not follow a
single exponential decay because different chromophores decompose
at different rates.39 It is important to
state here that these statements are postulations from the measured
absorption spectra of water-soluble and methanol-soluble extracts
and reported maximum absorption by different chromophores at different
wavelengths in literature. To make firm conclusions, more work such
as comparison of the actually measured molecular speciation with absorbance
spectra is needed.

In general, the absorption in the visible
range is more important
to the energy balance than the absorption in the UV range as nearly
40% of solar energy is found at wavelengths between 400 and 600 nm.
UV absorption affects photolysis, but wavelengths below 400 nm provide
only about 4% to solar energy.35

3.3 Relative Contribution of Water-Soluble and
Water-Insoluble Fraction to Total BrC
To investigate the
contribution of water-soluble and water-insoluble fraction to total
BrC during different periods, the ratio of babs (water/methanol) was calculated (Figure 3). The babs_Methanol represents total BrC, babs_Water denotes water-soluble BrC, and their difference reflects water-insoluble
BrC. This approach helps in assessing the fraction of water-soluble
BrC in the total BrC. It was observed that on average (integrated
over 310–600 nm), the water-soluble BrC contributes ∼33,
27, and 26% in daytime samples, whereas 26, 19, and 23% in nighttime
samples to total BrC in the samples collected during T1, T2, and T3 periods, respectively. Observations clearly
suggests that contributions of water-soluble BrC were more in daytime
samples compared to that in nighttime samples, and its fraction was
minimum during T3, maximum during T1, and in-between during T2. These observations also suggest that water-insoluble BrC
dominates total BrC over the study regions during the study period.
However, this water-soluble fraction of BrC was not uniform at all
wavelengths. It decreases with increasing wavelength and goes to as
low as ∼10% at 600 nm.

Figure 3 babs (water/methanol)
ratio versus
wavelength and % of water-insoluble fraction versus wavelength during
(a) pre-burning (T1), (b) during burning
(T2), and (c) during post-burning (T3) periods. Note that shaded area is overlapped,
that is, daytime W/M (blue) was always higher than that during
nighttime (red); however, the absolute value of ratio varied as a
function of wavelength. Green and black lines exhibit % water-insoluble
BrC fraction as a function of wavelength during day and night,
respectively.

Further, % water-insoluble
BrC in both day-and-night samples was
also estimated using the eq 2. 2  

The babs (water/methanol) ratios
for
shorter (310–400 nm) and longer-wavelength region (400–600
nm) were averaged. At the shorter-wavelength region, water-insoluble
fractions during the day (59, 67, and 67%) and night (67, 72, and
70%) samples were significant in T1, T2, and T3 periods,
respectively. Similarly, at the longer-wavelength region, water-insoluble
fractions during the day (72, 77, and 79%) and night (79, 86, and
81%) were dominant in T1, T2, and T3 periods, respectively.
During T2 period, night samples influenced
by BB emissions showed highest fraction (∼86%) of water-insoluble
BrC and day/night differences at the shorter-wavelength region were
less than those observed at the longer-wavelength region (Figure 3b). Lee et al.11 reported that chemical composition and optical
properties of BrC cannot be viewed as static, as they may change with
time. Light-absorbing compounds (responsible for the color of BrC)
can be potentially photobleached in sunlight and lose their ability
to absorb visible radiation.11 Our observations
suggest that BrC absorbing at higher wavelengths is predominantly
water-insoluble, and they are affected by daytime atmospheric processes
such as photolysis/oxidation of BrC chromophores and other transformation
reactions.13,40,41

3.4 Temporal Variability in BrC Composition through
Absorption Spectra
In order to understand the day-to-day
variability in BrC composition through absorption spectra, the absorptions
at 400, 405, 420, 450, 500, and 550 nm wavelength (representing absorption
by nitroaromatics)23,37,39,41 were normalized to the absorption at 365
nm (representing absorption by HULIS compounds).15,28,30 WSON comprised different nitrogen-containing
WSOC generated through SOA and NOx.13,23 Linear regression analysis between WSON and NOx showed good correlation (r2 =
0.64, figure not shown) during the T2 period,
suggesting the possibility of the presence of water-soluble nitrogen-bearing
BrC compounds. Recent laboratory studies have documented that anthropogenic
VOCs (benzene, toluene, and phenols) and PAHs react with nitrogen
oxides and produce light-absorbing nitroaromatics.12,23,32,33,38,42 These classes of nitroaromatics
absorb in the visible region such as 400, 405, 420, 450, 500, and
550 nm.33,40,42

Figure 4 shows the temporal
variability in babs_400, babs_405, babs_420, babs_450, babs_500, and babs_550 normalized to babs_365 for both water-soluble and methanol-soluble
BrC. The observed ratios were higher at shorter wavelengths and decreased
toward the visible region. It is interesting to note that methanol-soluble
BrC showed relatively less variability during all the three periods.
However, water-soluble samples showed higher day–night variability
during the T2 period and lesser variability
in T1 and T3 periods. This further suggests that BB emits a noticeable fraction
of water-soluble chromophore, which absorbs at the visible region.
At 405 and 420 nm, the variability was very high during the T2 period. It could be the presence of nitroaromatics
BrC chromophores. At 405 and 420 nm during the T2 period, enhanced absorbance (>20%) was observed in night
samples compared to day samples. Nitrophenolic compounds such as 2,4-dinitrophenol,
3-nitrophenol, and 2,5-dinitrophenol compounds absorb at 405, 420
nm, and 450 nm, respectively.23 These
compounds could be an important fraction of BrC in the urban atmosphere.
Further, the overall normalized ratios for babs_Methanol were higher compared to those for babs_Water, further suggesting that there was always a
significant insoluble fraction of BrC. However, this insoluble fraction
was not uniform and showed maximum contribution during the burning
period.

Figure 4 Temporal variability in babs_400, babs_405, babs_420, babs_450, babs_500, and babs_550 normalized to babs_365 for both (a) water-soluble and (b) methanol-soluble
BrC.

4 Conclusions
A novel approach has been proposed to use only babs spectra of water-soluble and methanol-soluble OC as
a tool to understand the broader composition and characteristics of
water-soluble and water-insoluble BrC, which otherwise need copious
amount of work and expensive facilities. As a case study, babs spectra of PM2.5 samples collected
before (T1), during (T2), and after (T3) a large-scale
paddy residue burning over Patiala were used. Magnitudes of N/D babs spectra ratios were always >1, with highest
values during T2 (1.8–3) followed
by T3 (1.3–1.5) and T1 (1–1.3) for 310–600 nm wavelength range,
reflecting the changes in composition and concentrations of BrC chromophores.
BrC abundances and composition were found to be very different during T2 nights, with significant contributions of
chromophores absorbing in 310–400 nm range. The contribution
of water-soluble BrC to total BrC decreases with wavelength, and water-insoluble
BrC dominates total BrC composition during the whole study period.
On average (integrated over 310–600 nm), the water-soluble
BrC contributes ∼33, 27, and 26% in daytime samples, whereas
26, 19, and 23% in nighttime samples to total BrC during T1, T2, and T3 periods, respectively. Further, temporal variability
in babs at different wavelengths normalized
to that at 365 nm in day and night samples suggests that BB likely
emits nitroaromatics, which are photosensitive and/or volatile. The
proposed approach shall be useful in BrC studies over different regions.
