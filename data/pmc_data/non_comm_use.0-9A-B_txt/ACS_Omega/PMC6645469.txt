The successful future of 2D materials,
which are crucial for accelerating
technology development and societal requirements, depends on their
efficient preparation in an economical and ecological way. Herein,
we present a significant advance in the top-down exfoliation and dispersion
method via an aqua colloid approach. We demonstrate that a broad family
of natural oil-in-water emulsification agents with an elevated hydrophilic/lipophilic
balance acts in the exfoliation of layered materials and the formation
of their concentrated colloids. The concentration exceeds 45 g/L for
exfoliated few-layered graphene sheets possessing a micrometer size.
The exfoliation of carbon nanofibers provides one of the best known
unsupported and N-undoped metal-free catalysts to date in the selective
dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene. Other examples include
aqua colloids of exfoliated/dispersed nitrides, carbides, or nanodiamonds.

Introduction
The
accelerating technological development and societal energy
demands require rapid and firm solutions that have to match the economical
and environmental issues. The major challenges concern several aspects,
starting with the choice of crucial materials and their preparation
methods. Because of their planar geometry and related in-plane propagation
properties, 2D materials and especially (few-layered) graphene (FLG)
have become materials of choice. In applications for which a high
yield of thin-layered structures is required, the top-down methods
based on exfoliations of bulk materials are of interest , especially
when more than one layer in the final material is sufficient and/or
preferable.1 This is especially true for
liquid-exfoliated FLG to be next applied in composites or energy storage
among others. Additionally, the related solution-processable suspensions
with significant 2D material concentration are a central interest
point in coating or printing sectors.1,2 A highest concentration
of graphene layers, up to 38 g/L, has been obtained in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, a performance assigned to the appropriate
surface tension (∼40 mN/m).2,3 The advantages
of processing in aqueous media are, however, environmentally unquestionable.
For this purpose and because of the hydrophobic character of graphite
(or other materials), graphene production runs either via graphene
oxide synthesis, followed by hardly happening conjugated C=C
lattice restoration,4,5 or via the use of surfactants.
The recent trends in surfactants register some biologically derived
species such as enzymes,6 RNA or DNA,7,8 vitamin B derivatives,9 proteins,10−12 polysaccharides,13,14 carbohydrates,15 or polyphenols.16 Singular examples
reach high-concentration aqua suspension of graphene using ionic surfactants.9,17 These biosurfactants, especially proteins such as bovine serum albumin
(BSA), were revealed to be efficient exfoliation agents, and investigations
of BSA adsorption over graphitic surface have been undertaken.11,17 Aiming to diminish defects/oxygen content and enhance the process
yield, the via-protein exfoliation was accompanied by shear/turbulence
in a kitchen blender.12,18 Although a concentration of BSA-exfoliated
FLG in water up to 7 g/L was achieved, FLG sheets with a weakly defined
geometry, often crumpled, and with a low average size (∼0.3
μm) were observed.12 Most of the
other biosurfactant-assisted exfoliations of graphite provide a similar
relatively low sheet size. Such a low sheet size with enhanced oxygen
content (edges) is beneficial for some applications including biomedical19,20 or catalysis,21,22 but not for domains where large
size sheets are better suited for easy propagation of a given property
within the bulk or on the surface of the final materials as nanocomposites.
The structure–property–application relationship is indeed
a crucial point, and a given property depends on the way graphene
is arranged and tailored in terms of geometry and chemistry.23

Our present work aims not only to push
the limits of exfoliation
of laminar materials in water but also to open new potential horizons
for future development. We do not take chemistry to a kitchen but
gastronomy to a laboratory. Although the effects of hydrophobic and
hydrophilic regions in biomolecules such as BSA on the production
of stable aqua dispersion was investigated previously,11,17,24 we take a broader look on it.
On the basis of our results, we define the exfoliation ability of
proteins such as BSA or hemoglobin (HEM) simply by their high hydrophilic/lipophilic
balance (HLB) and related oil-in-water (“o/w”) emulsification
ability as a driving force of the exfoliation, dispersion, and stabilization
of hydrophobic 2D materials in water.25 The approach meets the principles on which the use of BSA and HEM
in gastronomy, for instance, is based.26 According to this concept, several other “comestible”,
biocompatible, and naturally existing emulsifiers with sufficiently
high molecular systems such as maltodextrin, gums, agar-agar, or gombo
extracts have successfully been tested by us. Of course, the o/w emulsification
process includes the adsorption of specific groups from HLB systems
on the material surface, but the adsorbing groups will differ in HLB
systems; for example, the benzene rings or disulfide groups from BSA
as described earlier are absent in maltodextrin or other polysaccharides.

From a kitchen, we take also “the emulsion homogenization
concept” and add turbulence forces (mixing) to ultrasonications.
This simple innovation allows the efficient exfoliation of expanded
graphite (EG) and provides the aqua colloids/emulsions, with concentrations
in FLG higher than 45 g/L, where sheets of FLG flakes are of several
micron size.27 The emulsification property
of HLB systems demonstrates that, apart from the typical laminar graphite,
boron nitride or carbon nitride materials, silicon carbide, and nanodiamonds
can form stable aqua colloids. However, we essentially focus on EG
and carbon nanofibers (CNFs), first, to reach conductive large micrometer-sized
sheets and, second, to test exfoliation on CNFs for catalysis purpose.
The latter CNF-exfoliation-originated carbon reveals metal-free catalytic
activity in the selective dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene
with a performance exceeding that of nanodiamonds, the highest to
date (without considering N-doped and supported catalysts).22

Results and Discussion
In general, x mg of initial materials such as
EG and y = 0.1 x mg of HLB active
natural system are added to water and all is subjected to probe ultrasonication
treatment assisted by mixing with a “standard” stirring
magnetic bar (a mechanically driven top stirring can also be applied
with a bath sonication). The optimal ratio of the initial material
and HLB was chosen considering a yield of exfoliation for colloids
with a low concentration (1 g/L). Figure 1a,b demonstrates the representative aqua
colloids of FLG–BSA obtained after the ultrasonication/mixing
of EG (40 g/L) and of graphite (30 g/L), respectively. In the case
of EG, an additional amount of EG (and BSA) is subsequently added,
giving a concentration of 54 g/L. The settling-down process occurring
over 24 h results finally in stable colloids with concentrations of
47 g/L for EG and 8 g/L for graphite. Such high concentrations of
exfoliated materials, especially for EG, are possible because of the
coupling of HLB system and ultrasonication/mixing. The addition of
mixing to ultrasonication helps to homogenize the process in general
and especially to unify the contact between overall reaction medium
and ultrasound. This is not a case of bath or tip ultrasonications,
in which when used alone, the applied sound intensities are not uniform
and already dissipate at a distance of 1 cm–1 from
the tip in the tip sonicators.28−30 On the other hand, mixing alone
is insufficient for efficient exfoliation, but when coupled with sonication,
it also impacts the adsorption of HLB on the graphite surface and
solvation of the hydrophylic groups of HLB systems by water to overcome
the van der Waals interlayer forces in graphite and thus efficiently
disperse the graphite sheets. Moreover, in addition to its hydrophobic
character, EG is very lightweight and simply remains on the water
surface during the sonication. The addition of stirring creates a
vortex, which rapidly and progressively aspires EG (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Apart from highly concentrated
colloids and exfoliation efficiency, the use of EG is essential to
achieve a large size of FLG flakes. Instead of few hundred nanometers
(300 nm) reported previously from graphite, mainly few-micrometer
large sheets can be observed after a relatively short time (2 h) of
ultrasonication/mixing. The effect of the size of flakes is very important
for several applications including composites and coating layer fields.31,32 (A very recent work reported the use of microfluidization method
for the efficient exfoliation of graphite in water, where relatively
thick and medium-size FLG flakes were obtained.)30 Herein, a high, around few thousands, aspect ratio of FLG
(∼2000 considering the 3 μm flake of five graphene sheets)
is calculated.

the ultrasonication

(d) supernatant fraction, (e) optical photo of the HEM–water
colloid before ultrasonication and after ultrasonication and sedimentation,
and (f) UV–vis spectra of aqua colloids of HEM and FLG–HEM
before and after separation process (sedimentation or centrifugation).

The FLG–BSA colloid with
47 g/L can be also diluted, if
necessary. Progressive dilution induces a slight aggregation of FLG–BSA
at dilution by 103 (0.047 g/L), which can be rapidly overcome
by the addition of BSA grain and mild redispersion (Figure S2, Supporting Information). This shows that there
is still room to improve the stabilization of colloids by HLB systems
and possibly their mixtures and to establish the optimal parameters
related to the emulsification equilibrium. The emulsification phenomena
can already be observed for ultrasonicated aqua suspensions of pure
HEM and BSA proteins, where, according to the biochemistry literature,
the formation of microspheres (microcapsules) occurs.33,34 Such a formation has origins in the sonolysis of water, during which
the acoustic cavitations produce hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals and,
in the presence of oxygen, a superoxide radical. The latter plays
subsequently the role of cross-linking agent between disulfide bonds
from cysteine residues in microcapsules.33−35 Such spheres
of around 60–150 nm are also observed through microscopic analysis
in graphite—protein sonolysis product, and their inferior dimension
could be affected by partial protein degradation, by mixing, or finally
by interactions with graphite. The spheres are separated together
with heavy and weakly exfoliated fraction of graphite through a 24
h precipitation/decantation step (Figure 1c) and are quasi-absent in the stable supernatant
fraction (Figure 1d).
In the latter, the globin residue is present in amount sufficient
to glue and link the FLG flakes and to form stable colloids. The separation
of unstable HEM species from stable colloidal HEM can be clearly observed
for pure HEM ultrasonically dispersed in water. In this case, a high
amount of HEM settles down within a few hours (Figure 1e) and it seems that the presence of FLG
and subsequent interactions between FLG–HEM–water, vice
versa, increase the stability of HEM in water. The residue of HEM
in the suspension can be easily followed by UV–vis spectroscopy
as presented here for the FLG–HEM suspension (Figure 1f). In the case of BSA, the
precipitation and formation of spheres after ultrasonication/mixing
are significantly weaker as the protein is quasi-dissolved
in water (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The stability behavior of BSA in water, as mentioned above, remains
unchanged in the case of the FLG–BSA colloid, and BSA demonstrates
a superior ability for EG dispersion compared to HEM. This is probably
related to the better HLB of BSA and related detergent-like property.26,36 The slight foam formation on the colloid/air surface can be observed
in Figure 1a. It may
be reminded that with an increase of HLB (from ∼8), the o/w
emulsification ability changes from external o/w phase formation to
complete solubility of o/w through detergent solutions for HLB ≈
13–15. Because of the presence of relatively heavy iron and
large porphyrin systems, the impact of the hydrophilic part is reduced
in HEM. The translucent nature of the HEM–water system and
lucent (soluble) BSA–water confirm the different HLB for both
proteins (Figures 1e and S3, Supporting Information).

Figure 2 shows the
representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs
of FLG sheets obtained after the exfoliation of EG assisted by BSA,
HEM, maltodextrin, myoglobin, and agar-agar, after ultrasonication/mixing
for 2 h. According to TEM and SEM analyses, the average size of the
FLG flakes reaches several micrometers (Figures 1d and 2a–c).
The TEM micrographs obtained from the analysis at the edges of flakes
reveal the presence of few sheets, five in average (Figure 2d–f).

Figure 2 (a–c) Representative
TEM micrographs of FLG obtained after
FLG–HLB–water system ultrasonication, where HLB is BSA,
maltodextrin, myoglobin, respectively, and (d–f) number of
sheets, four, four, and six, observed at the curved edges in FLG–BSA,
FLG–HEM, and FLG–agar-agar, respectively. (For comparison
with the literature data, most of the presented investigations concern
the two globin-assisted exfoliations. Yet, detailed studies of other
mentioned biosystems are necessary in the near future.)

Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS),
thermal gravimetric
analysis (TGA), and conductivity measurements of FLG–HEM confirm
the quite high quality of the sample. Micro-Raman spectra recorded
for several FLG–HEM flakes show typical D, G, and 2D vibration
peaks at 1356, 1583, and 2720 cm–1, respectively
(Figure 3d). The relatively
weak D peak indicates the low defect content, and the ID/IG ratio calculated for
several flakes varies within the range of 0.02–0.08. This variation
arises from the variable number of sheets and amount of HEM on the
FLG surface. The shift of the 2D peaks toward lower wavenumbers associated
with the broadening of the higher energy 2D subpeaks, observed for
several flakes, confirms some distribution of the FLG–HEM thickness
with an excess of low sheet numbers, less than 5.37

spectra of EG (blue), FLG–HEM (red), and FLG–HEM-5h
(green) (inset: deconvoluted C 1s spectrum of FLG–HEM), (c)
TGA curves of EG, FLG–HEM, and FLG–HEM-5h, and (d) full
Raman spectrum of FLG flake and 2D peaks recorded on several FLG flakes
(a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm).

Apart from FLG sheets of significant size and low defect
content,
the exfoliation/dispersion process can be prolonged to decrease the
size of the sheets and enhance their decoration with oxygen (Figure
S4, Supporting Information). For this purpose,
the ultrasonication/mixing was extended to 5 h (FLG–HEM-5h):
a significant degradation/cutting of FLG induced by microjets and
shock waves was expected. Two mechanisms can be proposed for the cavitation
near the carbon surface, which creates localized erosion and/or oxygen-
and hydrogen-based radical formation during the sonolysis of water.35

The general XPS spectra confirm the high
purity of the samples
(Figure 3a), and the
defects as well as oxygen content increase with sonolysis time, as
observed by XPS (Figure 3b and Table S1, Supporting Information) and TGA data (Figures 3c and S5, Supporting Information). The full width at half-maximum
of the C 1s peak and oxygen-to-carbon ratio for EG, FLG–HEM,
and FLG–HEM-5h increase progressively and are 1.18, 1.21, and
1.25 and 0.024, 0.039, and 0.090, respectively. Accordingly, the π–π*
transition peaks decrease, indicating a lower electronic delocalization.
A decrease of combustion temperature in TGA is clear for FLG–HEM
and FLG–HEM-5h compared to EG. (FLG–HEM starts to burn
at a low temperature because of the locally enhanced amount of HEM,
whereas the main combustion temperature of FLG–HEM is higher
than that of FLG–HEM-5h, according to lower oxygen/defect content.)
To check the impact of the protein on electrical conductivity, FLG–HEM
and FLG–BSA as well as pure FLG after the acid hydrolysis of
the proteins (FLG–acid) were measured and calculated using
the four-point probe (FPP) method measurements. The measurements were
performed on papers formed by the filtration of the FLG–protein
supernatants and FLG–acid suspension in iso-propanol (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The papers were also subjected to an annealing process at 700
°C in He (Figure 4a,b). According to the average thickness of the papers determined
by SEM, the calculated conductivities of the FLG–protein papers
are roughly 102 S/m order before annealing and 104 S/m order after annealing. A conductivity of 105 S/m
order is reached for the FLG treated with acid and annealed; thus,
it is free of HLB (FLG–acid). The superior conductivity of
FLG–acid papers can be related, apart from protein removal,
to the beneficial transversal paper morphology, where FLG flakes are
closely packed, ensuring their efficient interconnection (Figure 4d). This is not a
case for FLG–protein papers and especially for BSA-assisted
exfoliation samples, where a spongelike arrangement of the flakes
can be observed, because of the detergent nature of the globin (Figure 4c).

the surface of the FLG–BSA paper;

the papers: (b inset and c) FLG–BSA, (d) FLG–acid.

Apart from “3D”
graphite, we applied the present
exfoliation/dispersion method on 1D carbon, that is, on CNFs with
a high edge-to-plane ratio. The HEM-assisted sonolysis of CNF–HEM
provides, after 2 h, a new carbon with a circular graphitic lattice
covered with globin residues (Figures 5a,b and S8, Supporting Information). Locally, clearly exfoliated
and separated graphitic segments can be observed as well. After the
sedimentation step, the stable suspension contains almost 80% of pure
product (Figure 5c).
Its CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analysis
reveals that the type of oxygen groups is modified in the new carbon
and the desorption process runs with a high content of lactone-type
groups (600–800 °C),38 whereas
the carboxylic group-related desorption areas (up to 450°) are
quasi-absent compared to CNF before their exfoliation [Figure S9b; see also the Supporting Information for XPS, TGA, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) analysis]. A significant content of highly electronegative oxygen-rich
groups in CNFs is in accordance with a low combustion temperature,
lower than that of CNF–HEM (Figure 5d). The difference in combustion temperature
can be also related to the Ni residues which are absent in the case
of CNF–HEM because they settled down during the sedimentation
process.

Figure 5 (a,b) TEM micrographs of the CNF–HEM catalyst obtained through
the exfoliation of CNFs in the HEM–water system, (c) general
XPS spectra of CNF and CNF–HEM, (d) TGA curves of CNF before
and after exfoliation/cutting in water, (e) ethylbenzene conversion
(open symbols) and styrene selectivity (filled symbols) as a function
of time on stream obtained for CNF–HEM (green), CNF–H2O (violet), and CNF (black) catalysts, and (f) benchmarking
of the activities of the catalysts prepared herein with those of commercial
and nanodiamond catalysts in the selective dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
to styrene.

The XPS results also
reveal a decrease of the oxygen content after
exfoliation (Figure 5c and Table S1, Supporting Information). The high content of oxygen in the initial CNFs
is indeed related to the acid/base treatments applied on the CNFs
just after their synthesis to remove the remaining catalyst and support.
This content decrease after the exfoliation/dispersion process indicates
some reduction. Because this phenomenon does not correlate with the
data obtained for EG exfoliation, we suggest that this reduction can
be related to the Ni catalyst traces, which are still present in CNFs
as encapsulated species and difficult to remove by acid/base treatment.
The exfoliation and cutting process in water allows the liberation
of Ni traces acting next as a hydrogenation catalyst (trace amount
of Ni does not disturb the activity of the exfoliated and cut CNFs
in dehydrogenation reactions, as described below).

CNF–HEM
was tested as a metal-free catalyst for the selective
dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene (ethylbenzene dehydrogenation,
ED). The CNF subjected to sonolysis/mixing without the globin (CNF–H2O, where only cutting and no “real” exfoliation
occurs) and initial CNF (see Figure S8, Supporting Information, for TEM) were also tested. The results of the
tests performed on time on stream reveal a higher conversion of ethylbenzene
and a greater selectivity toward styrene on both “degraded”
samples (32, 27, and 99%, 99% respectively) compared to initial CNFs
(10 and 93%, respectively) with the best conversion for exfoliated
carbon (CNF–HEM) (Figure 5e). This confirms that the catalytic activity is not
related to the potential traces of N and Fe in CNF–HEM, which
would originate from HEM porphyrin (Fe and N) and peptides (N). None
of these elements were detected by XPS, as expected, given the relative
amount of these elements in the final sample. Few-percent higher activity
of CNF–HEM can be related to the higher exfoliation/dispersion
degree of CNF–HEM compared to CNF–H2O and
the presence of globin as such. CNF–HEM is indeed a composite,
where HEM protects the CNF from excessive agglomeration and stacking,
thus increasing the accessibility of the active sites. The excellent
catalytic performances of both catalysts are reflected in Figure 5f through the benchmarking
of their activities with those of Fe-based commercial catalysts and
nanodiamonds. Excluding highly N-doped carbons,39−41 CNF–HEM
is one of the best metal-free unsupported catalysts known to date
in the literature.22 In addition, taking
into account the very harsh conditions for the synthesis of nanodiamonds
(detonation, high pressure, and temperature) as well as their cost,
CNF–HEM becomes an interesting alternative catalyst. Commonly,
the activity of carbons in ED reaction is assigned to the quinone
groups,42 and the presence of C=O-type
groups in CNF–HEM and CNF–H2O is confirmed
by XPS. However, more detailed studies on the structure/chemistry
and catalytic activity of these systems will be provided in the future.
To combine other potential structure-related advantages, CNF––HEM
may be additionally doped with N and/or coupled/supported over other
types of carbon.

To check the general relevance of the high
HLB natural systems
as exfoliation and/or dispersion agents coupled with ultrasonication/mixing
forces, other different materials such as not only typical layered
boron nitride (h-BN) and carbon nitride (C3N4) but also β-silicon carbide (SiC) and 0D nanodiamonds have
been subjected to the BSA-assisted exfoliation/dispersion process.
Their well-dispersed and stable colloids with a concentration of 8
g/L have been successfully obtained (Supporting Information, Figures S9 and S10). Yet, detailed studies of
their exfoliation and/or dispersion degrees are required.

Conclusions
Herein, we show that the use of natural systems of high HLB such
as HEM, BSA, agar-agar, or maltodextrin and turbulence (mixing)/ultrasonication
process in the exfoliation/dispersion of layered materials provides
aqua colloids with great concentration. Two important items are revealed:
large active natural systems possess high HLB and related o/w emulsification
ability and the addition of mixing to the ultrasonication allows the
unification the sound–reactant contact within the whole volume.
Apart from the typical layered materials such as graphite, boron nitride,
or carbon nitride, SiC and nanodiamonds have been tested. A concentration
up to 47 g/L is reached in the case of micrometer-sized well conductive
FLG sheets derived from EG. Such obtained FLGs have low oxygen/defect
content and high aspect ratio flakes, the latter being extremely important
for the future composite or coating layer applications. The conductivity
of FLG–HLB (FLG–BSA) composite reaches 102 S/m and can be increased to 104 and 105 S/m
by the annealing or removal of HLB system, respectively. If suitable,
lower size and well-oxygen-decorated FLG flakes can be prepared by
the strengthening of the exfoliation/dispersion conditions.

The process applied on CNFs results in exfoliation into a metal-free
and N-undoped catalyst, showing high performance in selective dehydrogenation
of ethylbenzene to styrene.

Other successfully tested HLB systems
include baobab karaya gum
and gombo extracts. Many other “gastronomy, cosmetology, or
drug” o/w emulsifiers including natural hydrocolloids (proteins,
carbohydrates, and polysaccharides) or their mixtures, also extracted
directly from the organic matter, are still to be explored, especially
for high-concentration colloids. The rheological studies would help
the establishment of optimal systems and ultrasonication/turbulence
conditions (Reynolds number),43 which changes
with the viscosity of colloids.

Experimental Section
Material
Preparations
HEM from bovine blood, BSA, and
myoglobin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Maltodextrin was purchased
from Myprotein. EG and graphite pellets were purchased from Carbon
Lorraine and Timcal, respectively. Boron nitride was provided by Johnson
Matthey Co. Nanodiamonds and silicon carbide were purchased from Carbodeon
Co. Ltd. and SiCat SARL, respectively.

FLG–HLB, FLG–BSA,
FLG–HEM, FLG–Myoglobin,
FLG–Maltodextrin, and FLG–Agar-Agar
(a) EG
(12.8 g) and 1 g of HLB agent were added to 320 mL of distilled water.
The ultrasonication was performed with an ultrasonic probe, Branson
Digital Sonifier 450, of ∼50/60 Hz frequency with an output
intensity of 10% of 400 W and under continuous stirring for 2 h. EG
(4.5 g) and 0.45 g of BSA were next added, and everything was sonicated
again for 1 h. The formed suspension was left for sedimentation for
24 h. The separated stable colloid has a concentration of around 47
g/L.

Other tested HLB were karaya gum and gombo extract. Karaya
gum was obtained as dried powder from baobab tree. The HLB extract
from gombo was obtained by cooking the vegetable in water at 80 °C
for 1 h.

(b) Graphite pellets (7.5 g) and 0.75 g of BSA were
added to 250
mL of distilled water. The ultrasonication was performed with an ultrasonic
probe, Branson Digital Sonifier 450, of ∼50/60 Hz frequency
with an output intensity of 10% of 400 W and under continuous stirring
for 3 h. The formed suspension was left for sedimentation for 24 h.
The separated stable colloid had a concentration of 7.7 g/L.

FLG–acid
The FLG–acid sample was prepared
by the aqua regia treatment of FLG–BSA under reflux condition
for 15 h in a round-bottom flask and subsequent purification with
distillated water to neutral pH, finalized by a drying step.

The CNFs were synthesized by a chemical vapor deposition method using
a mixture of C2H6 and H2 and Ni/Al2O3 as a growth catalyst.

The as-synthesized
CNF was further purified of the nickel growth
catalyst and the residual of the support by an acid and base treatment.
The as-treated composite was further washed several times with deionized
water until neutral pH.

CNF–HEM
As a general procedure, x mg of CNF and y mg of protein were added
to z mL of distilled water with an x/y/z ratio of 10:1:10. The ultrasonication
was performed with an ultrasonic probe, Branson Digital Sonifier 450,
of ∼50/60 Hz frequency with an output intensity of 10–20%
of 400 W and under continuous stirring for 2 h. The formed suspensions
were left for sedimentation for 24 h. The supernatants were next separated
from the precipitates and eventually additionally submitted to the
centrifugation process for 15 min at 2500 or 5000 rpm (Thermo Scientific,
Sorvall ST16 centrifuge).

CNF–H2O
CNF–H2O
was prepared following the same procedure but in the absence of the
globin.

Catalytic Tests
The conditions of
the catalytic tests,
product analysis and conversion, and selectivity calculations are
the same as ones previously reported.44 In brief, a steam-free dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene
was carried out with 300 mg of catalyst (CNF–HEM, CNF–H2O, and CNF), benchmarking catalysts and ethylbenzene (2.8%
in He) flow of 30 mL/min at 550 °C under ambient pressure. The
reagents and products were analyzed online by gas chromatography (Perichrom,
PR 2100) through flame ionization detection.

Characterization Tools
SEM was performed on a JEOL
2600F instrument operated at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV and
an emission current of 10 mA.

TEM was carried out on a JEOL
2100F worked at a 200 kV accelerated voltage, equipped with a probe
corrector for spherical aberrations, and a point-to-point resolution
of 0.2 nm. Prior to the analysis, drops of the aqueous suspensions
were deposited on holey carbon grids.

The XPS measurements were
carried out in a UHV setup (base pressure
1 × 10–9 mbar) equipped with a VSW class WA
hemispherical electron analyzer (150 mm radius) with a multichannel
electron detector. A monochromatic X-ray source (an Al Kα anode
operated at 240 W) was used as the incident radiation. The XPS spectra
were recorded in the fixed transmission mode using pass energies of
90 eV for survey and 44 eV for narrow scans. The Shirley method was
employed for background subtraction, prior to the fitting procedure.

Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRAM ARAMIS Horiba Raman
spectrometer equipment over the range of 500–4000 cm–1 at a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Prior to the measurements,
the samples were deposited on a SiO2/Si substrate by the
drop-casting of their suspension and carefully dried.

UV–vis
spectra of the suspensions were recorded using a
spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier PTP1 system (PerkinElmer
LAMBDA 35) at room temperature.

FPP sheet resistance (Rs) measurements
were performed on thin carbon papers by the FPP method by inducing
different current (I) from 1 μA to 1 mA through
two external probes and measuring the voltage difference (V) between two internal probes, with a Keithley 220 programmable
current source coupled with a Hewlett-Packard 34401A multimeter. In
the calculation of Rs from Ohm’s
law, a geometrical factor of the samples was considered.45

TPD analysis was carried out on a Micromeritics
ASAP-2100 under
vacuum from room temperature to 1000 °C at a heating rate of
5 °C/min.

TGA was performed on a Setaram apparatus at an
air flow rate of
25 mL/min and a heating rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature
to 1000 °C.

The specific surface area of the different
samples was determined
by the BET method using a Micromeritics TriStar sorptometer. The samples
were outgassed at 250 °C under vacuum for 5 h. Physisorption
measurements were carried out using N2 as an adsorbent.
