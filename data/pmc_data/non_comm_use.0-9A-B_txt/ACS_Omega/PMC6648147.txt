Syntheses
and structures of anionic arylphosphate monoesters
[ArOP(O)2(OH)]− (Ar = 2,6-CHPh2-4-R-C6H2; R = Me/Et/iPr/tBu) with different counter cations are reported. The counter
cations were varied systematically: imidazolium cation, 2-methyl imidazolium
cation, N-methyl imidazolium cation, N,N′-alkyl substituted imidazolium cation,
1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium cation, 4,4′-bipyridinium
dication, and magnesium(II) dication. The objective was to examine
if the supramolecular structure of anionic arylphosphate monoesters
could be modulated by varying the cation. It was found that an eight-membered
P2O4H2-hydrogen-bonded dimeric motif
involving intermolecular H-bonding between the [P(O)(OH)] unit of
the anionic phosphate monoester along with the counter cation is formed
with 2-methyl imidazolium cation, N-methyl imidazolium
cation, N,N′-alkyl substituted
imidazolium cation, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium cation, and
magnesium(II) dication; both discrete and polymeric H-bonded structures
are observed. In the case of imidazolium cations and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium
cation, the formation of one-dimensional polymers (single lane/double
lane) was observed. On the other hand, two types of phosphate motifs,
intermolecular H-bonded dimer and an open-form, were observed in the
case of 4,4′-bipyridinium dication.

1 Introduction
Noncovalent
interactions such as hydrogen bonding, π–π
stacking, van der Waals interactions, and electrostatic interactions
play an important role in one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D),
and three-dimensional supramolecular assemblies of various compounds.1,2 In particular, hydrogen bonding is crucial for the structural evolution
and for the associated properties in both biological and nonbiological
settings.3 In living organisms, the phosphate
functional group, OP(O)(OH)2, is a ubiquitous structural
element known to participate in H-bonding with a variety of functional
groups, leading to exquisite control of the biological activities.4 In organic synthesis, particularly in the field
of Brønsted acid-catalyzed organocatalysis, chiral phosphatediesters
(e.g., binol-based phosphatediesters) are well established.5−7 The H-bonding of the chiral phosphate diesters with the substrate
leads to significant enantiomeric excess.8−13 Similar applications have been reported in asymmetric fluorination14,15 and in the case of Heck–Matsuda coupling reactions.16 In this context, we became interested in the
reaction of phosphate monoesters with different bases to study the
H-bonding interaction of the resulting ion pair between an anionic
phosphate monoester and different counter cations. Although molecular
phosphate monoesters mostly form polymeric structures in the solid
state,17−25 we have recently reported the syntheses of several bulky aryl-substituted
neutral and anionic phosphate monoesters (1–8 in Scheme 1), which exhibit H-bonded dimeric molecular structures analogous
to those in carboxylic acids.26 Through
partial blockage of the H-bonding potential of the ArOP(O)(OH)2 unit by using either a hydrogen-bonding acceptor solvent
(such as acetone or acetonitrile) or a hydrogen-bonding donor as counter
cation (such as triethylammonium), we were able to realize dimeric
supramolecular structures (Scheme 1). Murugavel et al. independently also reported the
synthesis and molecular structures of 1 and 4.27

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures of Dimeric Forms
of Neutral Aryl Phosphate Monoesters, 1–4 and Anionic Aryl Phosphate Monoesters
along with Et3NH+ as Counter Cation, 5–826
In the case of the neutral phosphate monoesters 1–4, the P(O)(OH) unit is engaged in an eight-membered
P2O4H2-hydrogen-bonded dimer leaving
the remaining
P–OH moiety for H-bonding with the solvent (Scheme 1). On the other hand, in the
anionic phosphate monoesters, 5–8, the H-bonding in the dimeric structure varies with the substituent
in para-position. Thus, in 5, the terminal P=O
is free, while in 7 and 8, it is involved
in H-bonding interaction with the triethylammonium counter cation.

The above findings were limited to the triethylammonium counter
cation II. It was therefore of interest to systematically
study the structures of various self-assembled anionic phosphate monoesters I with different types of counter cations to gauge their effect
on the supramolecular organization of the anionic phosphate monoesters.
Accordingly, we chose different monocations and dications in an anticipation
to induce a larger structural diversity (Scheme 2): imidazolium cation III, 2-methyl
imidazolium cation IV, N-methyl imidazolium
cation V, N,N′-dialkyl-imidazolium
cation VI, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium cation VII, N,N′-dihydro-4,4′-bipyridinium
dication VIII, and magnesium dication IX (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Chemical
Structures of Anionic Phosphate Monoester I, Monocations II–VII, and Dications VIII–IX
Thus, families of ion pairs containing anionic phosphate
monoesters
with various counter cations (III, IV, V, VI, and VII) were obtained by
the stoichiometric reaction of the phosphate monoesters with imidazole, N-methyl imidazole, N,N′-dialkyl-imidazol-2-ylidene (N-heterocyclic
carbene, NHC), and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), respectively.
The anionic phosphate monoesters with counter cations VIII and IX were obtained by a 2:1 reaction of the phosphate
monoesters with 4,4′-bipyridine and magnesium dichloride in
the presence of Et3N. Apart from balancing the counter
charge of phosphate monoesters, the employed cations have different
numbers of potential H-bonding sites available, which was expected
to lead to different supramolecular structures (Table 1). While the imidazolium cation III possesses two N–H units along with a C2–H unit as H-bonding donor, the 2-methyl-imidazolium
cation IV has only two N–H units
accessible for this purpose. In contrast, the N-methyl-imidazolium
cation V features just a single N–H
unit along with a C2–H unit as donor for H-bonding
interaction. The N,N′-alkyl-substituted
imidazolium cation can be considered as similar to a triethylammonium
cation, where the C2–H can serve as a H-bond
donor. 1,4-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium cation VII has
one N–H moiety as a potential H-bond donor,
but in addition, a tertiary N center as a H-bond
acceptor. The N,N′-dihydro-4,4′-bipyridinium
dication VIII is characterized by two N–H donor centers separated by a rigid spacer; the possibility
of the formation of an H-bonded polymer can be envisaged. Finally,
the magnesium dication (Mg2+) IX on its own
would only neutralize the charge of the anionic phosphate monoester,
but not participate in H-bonding (Scheme 2).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
and Molecular Characterization
In the current study, we investigated
our recently reported bulky
aryl-substituted phosphate monoesters, ArOP(O)(OH)2 (Ar
= 2,6-CHPh2-4-R-C6H2; R = Me, 1; Et, 2; iPr, 3; and tBu, 4), as a source of the anionic
phosphate monoester, I. The reaction of 4 with 1 equiv of imidazole in CH3CN led to a white precipitate
after stirring the reactants for 20 h at room temperature (Scheme 3). The resulting
solid was crystallized in a 1:1 dimethylformamide (DMF)/CH3OH solution at room temperature, affording pure crystals of 9 (76% yield), which were suitable for single-crystal X-ray
diffraction analysis.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of 9
Solid-state molecular structure analysis reveals
that 9 crystallizes along with DMF as a solvent molecule.
The three donor
units of the imidazolium cation take part in H-bonding with an anionic
phosphate unit. The C2–H of the imidazolium
moiety is involved in a bifurcated H-bond with PO2–. Here, the C2 carbon referred to
the carbon center of imidazole/imidazolium moiety, which has been
flanked between two N centers. The two N–H moieties of the imidazolium cation each show slightly bent
H-bonding with P–O units of two adjacent anionic phosphate
monoesters resulting in the formation of a 1D H-bonded network. Additionally,
the P–O–H moiety of the anionic phosphate moiety is
involved in intermolecular H-bonding with the carbonyl group of DMF
(Figure 1). The 31P{1H} solution NMR spectrum of 9 shows
a singlet at δ = −4.7 ppm, suggesting the presence of
only one type of phosphorus center in the solution state. In the solid-state
cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP-MAS) 31P{1H} NMR spectrum, this resonance is only slightly shifted to
δ = −4.3 ppm.

With the confirmation
of the crucial H-bonding interaction of C2–H
of the imidazolium cation with anionic phosphate monoesters at hand,
we considered the use of the 2-methylimidazolium cation instead, in
which the C2 position is blocked from H-bonding by a methyl substituent.
Accordingly, a 1:1 reaction of 3 with 2-methylimidazole
in CH3CN resulted in a white precipitate, and suitable
single crystals of 10 were obtained from its saturated
solution in a DMF/CH3OH mixture (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of 10
The solid-state molecular structure
of 10 reveals
that a 1D polymer is formed through the H-bonding interaction of two
N–H units of the 2-methylimidazolium cation with the P–O
moieties of two adjacent phosphate units (Figure 2). The two polymeric strands are interconnected
through O–H···O hydrogen bonding between two
phosphate moieties, resulting in a double-lane, rail-road architecture.
The hydrogen bonding between the two phosphate motifs leads to the
formation of an eight-membered P2O4H2 ring similar to what had been observed in the ion pair with the
triethylammonium cation.26 The solution-
and solid-state CP-MAS 31P{1H} NMR spectra of 10 shows single singlet resonances at δ = −4.6
and −3.9 ppm, respectively, suggesting the presence of only
one type of phosphorus center in the molecule.

After having received different H-bonded structures of anionic
phosphate monoesters with imidazolium and 2-methylimidazolium cations,
the next logical step was to employ the N-methylimidazolium
cation in which one of the N–H sites is replaced
by an N-methyl moiety. Would it still function as
a mixed N–H/C–H donor
or merely as an N–H donor? A 1:1 reaction
of 3 with N-methyl imidazole in CH3CN afforded a white solid that was crystallized from a saturated
MeOH solution to afford X-ray quality crystals of 11 in
good yield (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of 11
Analysis of the solid-state structure of 11 reveals
that it possesses a discrete eight-membered P2O4H2 core with intermolecular O–H···O
hydrogen bonds between two anionic phosphate units similar to the
motif observed in the case of 10. The counter cation
is relegated to a supporting role with weak hydrogen-bonding interaction
found between the N-methylimidazolium N–H
and a P=O moiety with an O···H distance of 1.772(1)
Å (D···A distance 2.629(2) Å). CH3OH as solvent used for crystallization is also involved in a H-bonding
interaction with the P–O moiety with an O···H
distance of 1.965(9) Å (D···A distance 2.779(1)
Å) (Figure 3).
The 31P{1H} solution NMR spectra of 11 reveal the presence of a singlet at δ = −3.3 ppm.

Next, we considered doubly N-alkylated N,N′-dialkylimidazolium cations
to fully suppress the NH hydrogen-bonding capability only leaving C2–H as possible H-bonding donor.28,29N,N′-Dialkylimidazolium
cations are readily available from N,N′-dialkylimidazol-2-ylidenes (NHC) as precursors.30 NHCs as strong Lewis bases are readily protonated
to imidazolium cations.31 In this study,
we employed 1,3,4,5-tetramethylimidazol-2-ylidene, NHCMe4,32 and 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene, NHCiPr2Me2,32 as precursors to N,N′-dialkylimidazolium counter cations with
differing steric bulk at the N centers to directly
deprotonate anionic phosphate monoesters.33 Indeed, the 1:1 reactions of 4 with NHCMe4 and NHCiPr2Me2 in dry tetrahydrofuran
(THF) afforded compounds 12 and 13, respectively
(Scheme 6). These were
crystallized from saturated acetonitrile solutions at 0 °C.

Scheme 6 Syntheses of 12 and 13
Analysis of the solid-state molecular structures
of 12 and 13 reveals that both compounds
possess a discrete
eight-membered P2O4H2 core through
intermolecular O–H···O hydrogen bonds. Importantly,
a weak hydrogen-bonding interaction was also found between the imidazolium
C–H hydrogen and the P=O moiety of phosphate with the
C–H···O distance 3.003(6) Å in 13 compared to 2.600(1) Å in 12. The smaller distance
in the case of 12 is readily explained by the less sterically
encumbered CH hydrogen-bond donor. The imidazolium C–H bond
lengths were determined to be 0.950 and 0.929(2) Å for 12 and 13, respectively, which is slightly elongated
compared to imidazolium salts not involved in any H-bonding with the
counter anion, e.g., [NHCDipH][B(C6F5)3Cl] (0.88(2) Å) (NHCDip = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene)34 (Figures 4 and 5).

In the 1H NMR spectra, downfield resonances at
δ
= 9.29 and 9.89 ppm were detected for the imidazolium C2–H
for 12 and 13, respectively. In the 13C{1H} NMR spectra, the resonances at δ =
137.1 and 136.0 ppm are assigned to the C2 carbon of the imidazolium
moiety of 12 and 13, respectively. These
signals are considerably upfield-shifted compared to those of the
corresponding NHC.11 The solution- and
solid-state (CP-MAS) 31P{1H} NMR spectra of 12 and 13 show a single singlet resonance at
δ −2.3 and −3.0 ppm and δ = −4.9
and −3.4 ppm, respectively.

After the imidazolium-based
cations, which contain only H-bond
donor unit(s), we considered 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO),
which should result in the 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium cation VII with both H-bond acceptor and H-bond donor sites and thus
capable of functioning in a ditopic manner.35−37 Compound 14 was obtained by treating the ligand 1 with
1 equiv of DABCO and crystallized from a hot DMF/CH3OH
mixture (Scheme 7).
So far, we were unable to obtain high-quality single-crystal X-ray
diffraction data, and therefore, we are not discussing any metric
parameters of this compound (Figure 6).

ellipsoids
of 30% probability.

Scheme 7 Synthesis of 14
After considering
the ion pairs of anionic phosphate monoesters
with different monocations, we investigated the syntheses of ion pairs
of anionic phosphate monoesters with dications. Initially, we turned
our attention to the N,N′-dihydro-4,4′-bipyridinium
dication VIII. Thus, 15 was synthesized
from 3 and 4,4′-bipyridine in a 2:1 ratio. The
resulting solid was crystallized from CH3OH (Scheme 8). The product 15 contained a bis-protonated 4,4′-bipyridyl motif, which served
to neutralize the charge of two phosphate anions.

Scheme 8 Synthesis of 15
Crystal structure
analysis of 15 reveals a one-dimensional
polymer with two distinct phosphate motifs (Scheme 8). The CP-MAS of 31P{1H} NMR spectrum reveals the presence of three signals at δ
= −1.3, −4.3, and −5.2 ppm. In contrast, the 31P{1H} NMR spectra of this compound in CDCl3 with a small amount of DMF exhibit only one singlet at δ
= −4.2 ppm, suggesting that the solid-state structure is not
retained in solution. The crystal structure of 15 reveals
that both monomeric and dimeric phosphate units are present in a chain
connected to each other through the bipyridinium cation. The P=O
of the dimeric motif is simultaneously H-bonded to the N–H
of the bridging bipyridinium cation and a molecule of methanol. The
second bipyridinium N–H is involved in polymer propagation
through its interaction with a P–O unit of a monomeric phosphate
motif. The P–OH of the latter is tied down by the interaction
with another solvent molecule (MeOH). The two pyridyl rings of the
4,4′-bipyridine motif are twisted by a torsional angle of 44.206(76)°
(Figure 7).

So far, all of the mono- and dications
discussed have the potential
to be involved in H-bonding interactions, as shown above. Finally,
we were interested in a cation, which can only serve to neutralize
the charge of the phosphate anions, but will not have the capability
to be involved in a hydrogen-bonding interaction. The magnesium(II)
dication IX was chosen as the coordination of phosphate
monoesters and diesters with magnesium salts has been studied previously.38,39 The reaction of 2 equiv of 2 and 3 with
anhydrous MgCl2 in the presence of Et3N resulted
in a precipitate that was crystallized from either DMF or DMF/CH3CN mixture affording magnesium metallophosphates 16 and 17, respectively (Scheme 9).

Scheme 9 Syntheses of 16 and 17
Surprisingly, the
molecular structures in the solid state are different
with the variation of the aryl para substituents of the phosphate
monoesters from -Et to -iPr. The solid-state
molecular structure of 16 reveals the formation of a
1D polymeric chain through intermolecular H-bonding between the phosphate
moieties to an eight-membered P2O4H2 core and the coordination of P–O to the octahedral Mg(II)
center in a trans manner (Figure 8). The other four coordination sites of the magnesium
centers are occupied by DMF.

On the other hand, the molecular structure of 17 reveals
a discrete magnesium metallophosphate, where the coordination of P–O
to the octahedral Mg(II) center occurs in a cis manner enabling the
formation of the eight-membered P2O4H2 H-bonded core through intramolecular H-bonding interaction of two
anionic phosphate moieties (Figure 9). Here, as well, the remaining four coordination sites
of the Mg(II) center are occupied by four DMF molecules.

Compounds 16 and 17 can formally be considered
as regioisomers (cis/trans) with respect to the coordination of P–O to the Mg(II) center. In the case of the trans geometry,
the 1D polymeric network of magnesium phosphate is formed, while for
the cis geometry, only the discrete magnesium phosphate is obtained.
The solution-state 31P{1H} NMR spectra of 16 and 17 reveal the presence of multiple singlet
resonances in both cases (δ = −4.9, −6.1, −8.2,
−8.7, and −10.4 ppm for 16 and δ
= −4.9, −6.2, −8.4, −8.7, and −10.4
ppm for 17), which could be due to the fact that in solution,
these Mg phosphate complexes exist in more than one form. The solid-state 31P{1H} NMR spectrum of 16 reveals
the presence of a single resonance at δ = −5.6 ppm, whereas 17 exhibits two resonances at δ = −0.5 and −8.8
ppm. The resonance at δ = −0.5 ppm is considerably lower
in intensity compared to the resonance at δ = −8.8 ppm,
which might be due to the exchange of DMF with water during the sample
preparation. We repeatedly measured various single crystals of 16 and 17 to ascertain whether other structural
forms were present. However, we were unable to detect any structures
different from the ones discussed above. It is likely that the solid-state
structures of 16 and 17 correspond to the
thermodynamically stable forms, although this cannot be asserted with
certainty.

For all newly synthesized compounds, Fourier transform
infrared
spectra were recorded; the presence of broad absorption bands around
2491, 2430, 2389, 2386, 2408, 2423, 2389, 2390, and 2392 cm–1 and sharp absorption bands appearing at 1176, 1189, 1161, 1190,
1187, 1177, 1160, 1203, and 1161 cm–1 correspond
to a P–OH and P=O group
of 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, respectively.26 The imidazolium C–H stretching frequencies of compounds 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 appear at 3140, 3139, 3138, 3173, and 3152 cm–1, respectively.40,41 We have also performed the Hirshfeld
surface calculations of all of these newly synthesized compounds to
gain more insight into noncovalent interaction (see the Supporting Information for details).

3 Conclusions
The structure of the ion pairs of the phosphate
monoesters strongly
depends on the nature of the counter cations employed. Among the imidazolium
family, N,N′-dialkylimidazolium
and N-methylimidazolium cations lead to a discrete
dimer, with the formation of eight-membered P2O4H2 H-bonded core, which has been observed previously with
triethylammonium cations. On the other hand, imidazolium and 2-methylimidazolium
cations afford 1D polymers containing alternate phosphate and cation
moieties. In the case of the 2-methylimidazolium cation, a double-lane,
rail-road polymer was obtained, in which the two lanes are interconnected
by the eight-membered P2O4H2 H-bonded
ring. An interesting aspect of the crystal structures with imidazolium
cations is that the participation of NH and CH units in H-bonding is modulated by the variation in the
substituent of the imidazolium units. DABCO as monocation and 4,4′-bipyridine
as dication were assembled into polymeric structures, where the former
employed both N–H donor and N-acceptor sites for the interactions. Unsurprisingly, Mg2+ only served to neutralize the charge of anionic phosphate monoesters
and was not involved in H-bonding. Depending on the mode of phosphate
coordination (cis/trans) to the Mg center, it forms either a discrete
or 1D polymeric structure, both of which contain the eight-membered
P2O4H2 dimeric motif. In most of
the structures examined, the robustness of the dimeric P2O4H2 motif is clearly demonstrated, indicating
a similar dominance among phosphates as it is well known in the case
of carboxylic acids.
