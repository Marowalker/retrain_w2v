Bioelectricity
is emerging as a crucial mechanism for signal transmission
and processing from the single-cell level to multicellular domains.
We explore theoretically the oscillatory dynamics that result from
the coupling between the genetic and bioelectric descriptions of nonexcitable
cells in multicellular ensembles, connecting the genetic prepatterns
defined over the ensemble with the resulting spatio-temporal map of
cell potentials. These prepatterns assume the existence of a small
patch in the ensemble with locally low values of the genetic rate
constants that produce a specific ion channel protein whose conductance
promotes the cell-polarized state (inward-rectifying channel). In this way, the short-range interactions of the cells
within the patch favor the depolarized membrane potential state, whereas
the long-range interaction of the patch with the rest of the ensemble
promotes the polarized state. The coupling between the local and long-range
bioelectric signals allows a binary control of the patch membrane
potentials, and alternating cell polarization and depolarization states
can be maintained for optimal windows of the number of cells and the
intercellular connectivity in the patch. The oscillatory phenomena
emerge when the feedback between the single-cell bioelectric and genetic
dynamics is coupled at the multicellular level. In this way, the intercellular
connectivity acts as a regulatory mechanism for the bioelectrical
oscillations. The simulation results are qualitatively discussed in
the context of recent experimental studies.

Introduction
The
spatio-temporal coordination of biological processes requires
signal transmission and processing across a wide range of scales from
the single-cell to the multicellular level. In the case of ensembles
of non-neural cells, simple diffusion alone does not allow a rapid
and efficient propagation of signals without significant distortion,
and bioelectricity is emerging as a complementary mechanism because
of some essential characteristics:1−8 (i) bioelectrical signals can act in concert with biochemical and
biomechanical signals to orchestrate large-scale outcomes; (ii) electrical
potential and current are especially suited for information processing
because they can modulate the single-cell state via the membrane ion
channels and the multicellular connectivity via the intercellular
gap junctions; and (iii) using modern experimental techniques, it
is currently possible to associate bioelectrical magnitudes
such as cell membrane potentials V with molecular
biology components such as the specific ion channel proteins
that regulate V. Remarkably, the above experimental
facts are common not only to networks of excitable cells in the brain
but also to nonexcitable cellular ensembles in tissues.1−3

Signaling ions and charged molecules such as calcium and serotonin
can influence transcriptional, translational, and post-translational
processes. Therefore, genetic and bioelectric networks should be interrelated
because the local concentrations of these signaling ions and molecules
over multicellular ensembles depend on the spatio-temporal map of
cell electric potentials.1−3 Increasing experimental evidence
shows a complex feedback between multicellular bioelectrical states
and gene expression patterns in embryogenesis, regeneration, and tumorigenesis.1,3−8 Hence, a better understanding of bioelectrical magnitudes should
allow complementing the currently dominant bottom-up molecular approaches with top-down descriptions
based on macroscopic concepts that may be useful for tissue engineering
and regenerative medicine.1,3−5,8,9

Experimentally, the dynamic monitoring and spatio-temporal control
of bioelectrical states described by cell potentials could be based
on electrical double-layer-gated field-effect transistor biosensors,10 the binding of nanoparticles to the cell membrane,11,12 the external application of electric fields5 and voltage pulses,13 and the induction
of polarized/depolarized cell states by means of pharmacological,
optogenetic, and molecular genetic techniques including the local
injection of mRNAs that encode specific ion channels.14−16 Theoretically, the biophysical description of the above processes
requires new conceptual schemes(17−19) that incorporate
not only the single-cell characteristics but also the intercellular
connectivity because the control of large-scale multicellular ensembles
can constitute a convenient alternative to acting on individual cells.

The question of how biological systems process information constitutes
one of the current problems in modern biophysical chemistry. It has
been shown that multicellular aggregates of nonexcitable cells can
store bioelectrical memories in the form of spatio-temporal patterns
that encode information for specific biological outcomes.1−4,19 In particular, Levin and co-workers
have emphasized that these patterns act as a software that allows the communication among cells using both biochemical
and bioelectrical signals.2,4,14,15,19 In a similar way, synaptic transmission in excitable cells also
involves chemical and electrical signals, and these two forms of neuronal
communication are crucial for brain development and function.20

Following an admittedly simplistic but
vivid analogy,2,4,19 the
genome would encode the hardware—for example,
the ion channel proteins that
regulate cell membrane potentials and intercellular connectivity—but
a better knowledge of the software—for example,
the spatio-temporal maps of cell electric potentials and signaling
molecules—might allow the control of biological outcomes at
a different level than that of single-cell molecular genetics. Experimentally,
this bioelectrical control has been studied in the regulation of cell
proliferation and differentiation,6 the
plasticity of predifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells,9 and the differentiation of the mammalian lens.5 Interestingly, it has also been shown that the
same body with the same genome can store different bioelectrical patterns
acting as distinct memories for regeneration in flatworms,4 which suggests the different roles of biological hardware and software in this model system.

Oscillatory phenomena are central to biology, and it has been demonstrated
that information processing in non-neuronal cells and bacterial communities
makes use of oscillatory biochemical and bioelectrical patterns. For
instance, low-frequency current noise and membrane potential oscillations
have been detected in glioma cells where specific K+- and
Na+-ion channels coordinate electric responses throughout
large cell populations.21 Cell electric
potentials and metabolic oscillations are closely connected in bacterial
communities where the intercellular bioelectrical communication at
the long-range level is also based on K+-ion channels and
extracellular concentrations.22 In particular,
two biofilm communities undergoing metabolic oscillations can be coupled
through electrical signaling in order to synchronize their growth
dynamics.23 Other experimental examples
concern the gap junction-mediated electrical coupling characteristic
of the electrical oscillations in the heart24 and the metabolic oscillations in pancreatic islets.25 Remarkably, oscillations between polarized and
depolarized cell potentials can also be coupled with genetic pathways,
as observed in the development of the two sides of an embryo.26 In single-neuron models, bistability and oscillatory
phenomena have been shown to arise from the coupling between voltage
pulses and gene expression.27

It
is important to note the central role played by the ion channel
proteins in the above experimental systems, although the specific
function of a particular channel is often difficult to ascertain because
of the complex nonlinear interactions between the different channels
involved in each particular case. In the case of neurons, for instance,
it has been experimentally demonstrated that a balance between outward
and inward-rectifying channels is required for generating slow oscillatory
activity.28 Recently, a synthetic excitable
tissue composed of a small number of functional ion channels and pumps
has been described.29 The system of optically
reconfigurable bioelectric oscillators can perform information processing
tasks via propagation of electrical waves based on cell potentials.29Could bioelectrical oscillations allow
the coordination of spatially separated cells across long distances?

We attempt to model the oscillations arising from the feedback
between the genetic and bioelectric descriptions in a multicellular
ensemble of coupled nonexcitable cells where the individual cell properties
are regulated by ensemble-averaged magnitudes such as electric potentials.
Because ion channels and membrane potentials are significant to organism
morphology and tumor initiation,6−8,19,30,31 we focus on
the transcription and translation rates of an ion channel protein
that regulates the single-cell membrane potential.32 We assume that these rates can be spatially heterogeneous
and study the bioelectrical consequences of this assumption. Our previous
work concerns the theoretical description of the coupling between
the bioelectrical and genetic descriptions17 and the simulation of abnormal depolarization processes in model
multicellular ensembles.33 In the latter
case, a first attempt to establish the conditions needed for oscillations
was made. However, we did not carry out a complete study of the optimal
windows allowing oscillatory signals nor systematically simulated
the effects of intercellular connectivity and protein transcription
constants on bioelectrical patterning. We connect here the genetic
spatial prepatterns with the resulting map of cell potentials, describe
the long-range effect caused by the polarized membrane potentials
of distant cells on locally depolarized cell potentials, show that
oscillatory signals alternating polarized and depolarized cell potentials
can be maintained for optimal windows of the intercellular connectivity,
and suggest that remodeling this connectivity can act as a regulatory
mechanism for the multicellular ensemble.

Model Genetic and Bioelectric
Networks
Biological systems show often a multilayer
network structure; in the brain, individual neurons are coupled
through
gap junctions both via chemical synapses and via electrical synapses.34 The collective patterns emerging from the dynamical
processes that occur in multilayer networks are much richer than those
corresponding to single-layer networks.34 In our case, the intercellular coupling is regulated by the feedback
between the genetic and the bioelectric layers.17,33 On the basis of previous and emerging experimental
data (see, e.g., refs2−4,7 and references therein), we assume that the central
biological parameter connecting these layers is the transmembrane
potential.19 This bioelectrical magnitude
is defined as the electrical potential difference V < 0 between the cell cytoplasm and the extracellular environment.
Under conditions of zero total current, V is usually
termed the resting membrane potential.35 The potential difference V is regulated by the
extracellular and intracellular ionic concentrations together with
the conductances of specific ion channels inserted in the cell membrane.7,30,36−39 This potential constitutes a
significant readout of the cell bioelectrical state.7,8,30 For instance, proliferating cancerous
cells show that abnormally low values of |V| and
high values of |V| are characteristic of differentiated
cells,6,7,30 though the
particular role of |V| in tumorigenesis is still
under discussion.7,8 It has been shown experimentally
and theoretically that a simplistic but qualitatively useful description
of V can be obtained using a minimal model with two
voltage-gated channels pol and dep, one regulating the current around the polarized (pol) potential and the other regulating the current around the depolarized
(dep) potential.35−38

The kinetic equations that
describe the intracellular mRNA (m) and protein (p) concentrations of one
of the ion channels are coupled with the cell potential because the
spatial distribution of the signaling ions and molecules that regulate
the genetic transcriptional and translational networks depends on
the local values of V.1−3,17,18 In this way, the role of a particular
ion channel is sensitive to the other functional channels that may
upregulate or downregulate its expression via the cell electrical
activity. This feedback mechanism between different channels has been
experimentally confirmed.2,3,19,40 Note that, in addition to acting
on ion channel expression, the cell potential V can
also act post-translationally, for example, by driving the blocking
of a particular channel with specific ions and molecules and by changing
the conductance of voltage-gated channels.32,41,42

The model of Figure 1 has been described in detail previously33 and assumes that the concentration p of the protein
that forms the voltage-gated channel which is open around the polarized
(pol) potential is influenced by the cell potential V. Molecular diffusion in the cell can be ignored as a first
approximation because it is usually fast compared with genetic processes.43 The rate constants for mRNA transcription (rmo) and protein translation (rp) and the
respective degradation rate constants (dm and dp) may depend on multiple kinetic
steps.17,27,44,45 The cell potential-dependent concentration S of a specific signaling ion or molecule is assumed to
influence the effective potential-dependent protein transcription
rate rm(V) (Figure 1, left, bottom).
For the dependence of the channel conductance on the protein intracellular
concentration p, we consider the Hill kinetics Gpol = Gpolo[p/(p0 + p)], where p0 = 60 corresponds to Gpolo/2 and Gpolo is the maximum
conductance (Figure 1, left, top). The cell potential V is regulated
by the conductances Gpol and Gdep, with Gpolo/Gdep = 1.5,
together with the equilibrium potentials Epol and Edep (Figure 1, left, top). The values Epol = −60 mV and Edep = 0 mV assumed here do not change with time provided that the intracellular
and extracellular ionic concentrations are approximately constant.46,47

Figure 1 Genetic
and bioelectrical feedback at the single-cell level is
shown for the case of a channel protein (pol) whose
transcription and translation kinetic equations are based on the central
dogma (left, bottom) for the information
flow from DNA to mRNA (transcription) to protein (translation). A
specific mRNA of concentration m regulates the channel
protein concentration p, where m and p are relative values that depend on the biochemical
system considered.33 (Adapted from Figures 1 and 2 of ref (33), published by the PCCP Owner Societies Royal Society of
Chemistry.)

The interplay between the bioelectric and genetic descriptions
is extended from the single-cell to the multicellular ensemble by
the intercellular gap junctions of effective conductance Gij coupling the cells i and j (Figure 1, right, bottom). Remarkably, the electrical synapses
and the channels that join plant cells have some qualitative similarities
to gap junctions concerning the transfer of intercellular information.
In nonexcitable cells, which is the case studied
here, these intercellular connections are found in a multitude of
animal cells. Experimentally, Gij is a bell-shaped function of the potential difference Vj – Vi (Figure 1, right, top), where Go is the maximum conductance of the junction and the potential V0 = 18 mV gives the width of the experimental
distribution of conductances.17,46,48 In this way, the cell potential Vi evolves with time t because of the single-cell
currents Ipol,i and Idep,i and the intercellular
current regulated by Gij and Vj – Vi. The sum over j ∈ nn considers only the nearest-neighbor (nn) cells around
the central cell i.17

As mentioned previously, the experimental basis of the model of Figure 1 is that the electric
potential influences the local concentration S of
a signaling ion (e.g., calcium) or molecule (e.g., serotonin) that
regulates in turn the transcription rate constant r(V) of the channel (Figure 1, left, bottom). Certainly, the model is
an oversimplification of real biological problems, but it provides
a simple description of the bioelectrical and genetic feedback in
terms of a reduced number of concepts that can be extended to more
complex cases.18,19,49 The input parameters for the model of Figure 1 are chosen within a range of biologically
relevant values that were previously justified.17,33

Note that for the particular case of zero current Ipol + Idep = 0 between
the
external microenvironment and the cell cytoplasm of an isolated cell,
the transmembrane potential V of Figure 1 (left) reduces to the single-cell
resting potential.35 The equations for
the currents Ipol and Idep qualitatively describe the observed experimental trends
in terms of a small number of phenomenological parameters: the effective
charge z = 3 for channel gating and the threshold
potentials Vth,pol = Vth,dep = −VT, with VT = RT/F =
27 mV for the thermal potential, where R is the gas
constant, T is the temperature, and F is the Faraday constant.32,35 Note that the conductances Gpol and Gdep contribute
differently to the total membrane conductance. In particular, when
the conductance ratio Gpol/Gdep takes low values, Vmem is decoupled from the normal polarized value Epol and Vmem assumes depolarized
potentials close to Edep.35,38

Experimentally, the concentration S of a
signaling
ion regulating the genetic rates can change with the cell potential Vmem.1,18,50−52 The model of Figure 1 (left, bottom) considers the Hill kinetics rm = rmo/[1 + (S/S0)] = rmo/(1 + e|V|/VT) for the protein transcription rate,17 where rmo is the maximum transcription
rate that is attained in the absence of a specific signaling ion, S = 0, and S0 is a reference
concentration. This equation shows a potential-dependent negative regulation of the protein because an increase in |V| decreases the production rates of mRNA.17 Note that the bioelectric and genetic descriptions of Figure 1 are strongly coupled: the
potential |V| characteristic
of the cell regulates the concentration p of the
channel protein that gives the conductance Gpol (Figure 1, left, bottom); in turn, Gpol modulates
the total membrane conductance that gives the potential V (Figure 1, left,
top). Recent experimental and theoretical results strongly suggest
that there is a significant feedback between bioelectric and biochemical
networks (see, e.g., ref (19) and references therein).

Interestingly, the single-cell state described
by Figure 1 can be
modulated at the ensemble level because of the coupling
of the central cell with the neighboring cells.17,18,35 This coupling is allowed by the intercellular
gap junctions that permit the transference of electric currents17,18 and signaling molecules18,49 between two adjacent
cells (Figure 1, right,
bottom). In particular, every central cell i experiences
the average electric potential because of its nearest-neighbor
cells, as shown explicitly by the sum ∑j∈nnGij·(Vj – Vi) (Figure 1, right, bottom), where the contribution
of the neighbor cell potential j is weighted by its
junction conductance Gij. The intercellular coupling is described by the conductance ratios Go/Gdep and Gpolo/Gdep for the relative contributions
of the intercellular (Go) and single-cell
(Gpolo) effective conductances with respect to the common reference
value Gdep. In this way, Go/Gdep constitutes a measure
of the intercellular connectivity degree: large values of Go/Gdep should give
isopotential multicellular regions, whereas low values of Go/Gdep should give
isolated cells with no bioelectrical communication. Abnormal intercellular
communication resulting in largely autonomous cells appears to be
involved in the initial states of some cancerous processes.48,53,54

The numerical algorithm
used to solve the system of coupled equations
of Figure 1 has been
described in detail previously; see, in particular, the Methods section
of ref (35) together
with ref (33) for additional
explanations. The cells in the multicellular ensemble are assumed
to form an elliptic monolayer33 initially
at the same potential Vi(t = 0), with i = 1, ..., N, with N = 304 cells. The initial concentrations
of mRNA and protein are obtained by solving the respective equations
of Figure 1 under steady-state
conditions.17 The evolution of the system
for times t > 0 is given by the N equations for the cell potentials Vi(t) of Figure 1 (right, bottom). The characteristic time Ci/Gpolo gives an electrical
response lower than 1 s for capacitances and conductances within the
ranges Ci = 10–100
pF and Gpolo = 0.1–1 nS,17,18,46 respectively. On the contrary, the genetic
processes in the cell are relatively slow because transcription and
translation rate constants (rmo and rp) within the range 0.1–1 min–1 give times
between 1 and 10 min, whereas degradation rate constants (dm and dp) within
the range 0.003–0.1 min–1 give times between
0.1 and 5 h.17,45,49

Results and Discussion
The results shown in Figure 2a–d are obtained by
assuming different values for the
genetic rates rmo and rp of Figure 1 in the small patch
and the rest of the multicellular domain (Figure 2a). The cells outside the patch have rmo = 1 min–1 and rp =
1 min–1, while these rates are decreased to rmo = 0.25 min–1 and rp = 0.25 min–1 for those cells in the patch. According
to the model of Figure 1, this decrease in the rates would give a reduced expression of the
ion channel protein of conductance Gpol at the patch and then a local depolarization33 with respect to the rest of the domain.

Figure 2 (a) Potential V for a central cell in the patch
as a function of the number of cells in the patch, Np, at fixed intercellular connectivity Go/Gdep = 0.5. The genetic
network of Figure 1 operates with a spatial heterogeneity in the rate constants: the
cells outside the patch have rmo = 1 min–1 and rp = 1 min–1, while these rates
are decreased to rmo = 0.25 min–1 and rp = 0.25 min–1 for those cells
in the patch. The degradation rate constants are dm = 0.025 min–1 and dp = 0.025 min–1 in both regions. The
intermediate cases correspond to the oscillatory behavior. (b) Time-dependent
cell potential V for the values of Np indicated in the curves at fixed Go/Gdep = 0.5. (c) Potential V for a central cell in the patch as a function of Go/Gdep at fixed Np = 55. (d) Time-dependent cell potential V for the values of Go/Gdep indicated in the curves at fixed Np = 55. Note that the finite number of cells
in the patch together with the intermediate values of the intercellular
conductance used prevents the patch to achieve the limiting polarized
and depolarized potentials characteristic of the oscillatory region.

The initial (t = 0) conditions used in the multicellular
ensemble correspond to the steady-state solution for the dominant
polarized state of the cells outside the patch. However, the spatial
differences assumed for the genetic rates tend to produce a regionalization
of the domain polarization in the long term: the decrease of the pol channel protein production acts to depolarize (low |V|) the patch cells with respect to the rest of the polarized
(high |V|) domain. The small size of the patch, however,
makes it difficult to keep its depolarized state against the dominant
polarized state in the rest of the domain except for the cases of
high number of patch cells (Np; Figure 2a) and low intercellular
connectivity (Go/Gdep; Figure 2c) of the patch with the rest of the domain.

At intermediate
values of Np (Figure 2b) and Go/Gdep (Figure 2d), oscillatory cell potentials are obtained.
To better understand these bioelectrical oscillations, it should be
noted that when the pol ion channel protein transcription
and translation rate constants rates are sufficiently low there is
only one stable (depolarized) potential, which is
the case of the cells in the patch.33 On
the contrary, when these rate constants take high values, there is
only one stable (polarized) potential, which is the
case of the cells outside the patch.33 Thus,
the stable bioelectrical states for the cells in the patch and the
rest of the domain are unique and opposite. Initially, all cells in
the domain are assumed to have the same polarized potential that characterizes the normal cell state
(Figure 2b,d). However,
this polarized potential is not stable for the cells in the patch,
which have relatively low rates rmo and rp with respect to the rest of the domain. These low protein production
rates eventually give low values of the channel conductance Gpol for the cells in the patch. Therefore, these
cells tend to reach the stable depolarized potential
consistent with the locally low rates assumed. In the long
range, however, the cells in the rest of the polarized domain act as a bioelectrical buffer forcing the
repolarization of the patch for low Np (Figure 2a) and high Go/Gdep (Figure 2c). For intermediate
cases, bioelectrical oscillations in the patch can be sustained (Figure 2b,d) because of the
interplay between the genetic (protein concentration in Figure 1, left, bottom) and electric
(cell potential in Figure 1, left, top) mechanisms.

We establish now the experimental
window where bioelectrical oscillations
would be possible. Figure 3 shows the phase diagram obtained for the cell potentials
in the patch as a function of Np and Go/Gdep. This diagram
can be constructed for each biological system at fixed values of the
genetic rate constants of Figure 1 and graphically describes the different cell bioelectrical
states (depolarized–oscillatory–polarized) described by V as a function of the number of
cells and the degree of intercellular connectivity. In this way, the
long-range effects on the small patch to be expected in each experimental
case can be predicted and optimal windows for the patch size and intercellular
coupling can be established. In particular, the different regions
of Figure 3 clearly
suggest that (i) the patch size is critical for bioelectrical oscillations
to occur and (ii) remodeling the intercellular connectivity constitutes a regulatory mechanism for establishing
spatio-temporal bioelectrical patterns. Both theoretical predictions
are in qualitative agreement with experiments conducted on model systems.2,4,19,26,36,55

Figure 3 Phase diagram
for the cell states in the patch as a function of
number of cells, Np, and the degree of
intercellular connectivity, Go/Gdep. The insets schematically
show the different time evolutions of the cell potentials for three
bioelectrical states of the patch. The central region shows that oscillatory
phenomena can occur within a window of intercellular connectivities
for an intermediate number of cells in the patch. The points correspond
to the simulations carried out along the transition region between
oscillatory and nonoscillatory cell states. This transition shows
some sharpness because of the finite number of cells and the variable
contour of the patch used in the simulations.

The simulation results of Figures 2 and 3 suggest that
modifying
the coupling degree provided by the gap junctions of Figure 1 (right) allows the flexible topology, which is needed to establish or abolish
single-cell bioelectrical oscillations between the depolarized and
polarized single-cell states. In the limits of weak and strong coupling
represented by low and high values of the intercellular connectivity,
the cells in the patch exhibit only one dynamical solution which corresponds to the depolarized or polarized state, respectively.
However, other dynamical solutions including oscillatory
states emerge at intermediate intercellular coupling values.

The extensions of the depolarized and polarized regions of Figure 3 also suggest that the regimes of weak and strong intercellular coupling where no oscillation
is possible should be robust. In the first case, the cells in the
patch are essentially isolated from the rest of the domain and remain
thus in the depolarized state because of their low pol channel protein transcription rates. In the second case, these cells
can shift to the opposite polarized state because of the coupling with the surrounding polarized cells in the rest of the domain in
spite of the locally low rate constants in the patch favoring depolarization.

Experimentally, weakly connected multicellular ensembles show spatial
heterogeneities of the cell polarization that are crucial in embryogenesis
where the local expression of ion channels and pumps usually gives
bioelectrical regionalization.2,14,41 On the contrary, strongly connected ensembles should give isopotential
ensembles where no patterning information can be stored.17 In this case, the strong coupling of the patch
with the majority of cells in the rest of the domain would provide
bioelectrical stabilization against any spatial fluctuation of the
genetic rates favoring the patch abnormal depolarization. Note that
this long-range stabilization could be useful to avoid the autonomous
behavior of the patch cells promoted by abnormally low local genetic
rates.17,33

It has been reported that endogenous
bioelectric gradients act
as instructive factors for morphogenetic processes and that the intercellular
connectivity experiences dynamic changes during embryonic development.1−3 Rather surprisingly, the electric potentials of distant cells can
reverse local biological processes by long-distance signaling.26,55 Indeed, it has been experimentally observed that opposite
local and distant bioelectric signals can
counterbalance crucial cellular process such as proliferation and
apoptosis.55 In developing embryos, for
instance, the brain development that was disrupted by the local perturbation
of cell potentials could be reversed by long-distance electrical signals.55 As it could be expected, the efficient transduction
of these distant bioelectric signals requires the presence of active
gap junctions:55 the disruption of the
gap junction-based intercellular communication on one side of the
embryo can affect electrically driven physiological changes on the
other side26 and influence apoptosis in
the developing brain.55 In the above processes,
the dynamic nature of the intercellular gap junctions
appears to be crucial.

Figure 4 provides
some qualitative insights relevant to these experimental observations.26,55 In particular, we illustrate how dynamic, time-dependent gap junction
conductances allow the transitions between the cell membrane potentials
in the small patch. Initially (t = 0), the cells
in the patch are assumed to be in the polarized (red) state. However,
the low intercellular connectivity Go/Gdep = 0.4 considered initially in Figure 4 cannot allow the distant normally
polarized cells to enforce this state for a long time because the
local genetic prepattern in the patch favors the opposite abnormally depolarized (blue) state. In this case and because of
the patch isolation, the genetically favored depolarized state is
eventually reached (Figure 4). At intermediate times, the increase assumed for the intercellular
coupling (Go/Gdep = 0.5) allows the distant cells to start influencing the patch cells
and thus oscillatory potentials are obtained. Finally, at long times,
a further increase of the intercellular connectivity to Go/Gdep = 0.6 can allow the
distant polarized cells to reverse the local electric potentials of
the depolarized cells in the small patch (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Remodeling the intercellular connectivity emerges
as a regulatory
mechanism. The cells in the small patch have locally low values of
the protein rate constants rmo and rp. The snapshots correspond to the different multicellular bioelectrical
states obtained when the dynamic intercellular conductance follows
the time sequence Go/Gdep = 0.4, Go/Gdep = 0.5, and Go/Gdep = 0.6 schematically shown by the abrupt
conductance steps. The spatio-temporal maps of potentials are obtained
for a fixed number of cells Np = 55 in
the patch and a total number of cells N = 304 in
the multicellular domain. Other conditions and parameters are the
same as that of Figure 2.

Figure 5 is obtained
at the intermediate intercellular conductance Go/Gdep = 0.5, and the protein transcription
rate rmo is changed. As in Figure 4, the cells in the patch that were polarized at t = 0 could depolarize with time because of the low values
initially assumed for the pol channel protein transcription
rate. However, these cells become polarized when this rate is increased,
assisted also by the long-range action exerted by the polarized cells
outside the patch. In between these cases, an oscillatory regime emerges,
which is determined by the number of cells in the patch and the intercellular
coupling (Figure 3).

Figure 5 Dynamic
changes in the single-cell balance between the dep and pol channels caused by an increase
in the transcription rate constant rmo of the pol channel protein at fixed intercellular conductance.
Initially (t = 0), the cells in the small patch are
assumed to be in a polarized state that is not stable because of the
locally low values of the transcription rate rmo corresponding
to the pol channel protein. The subsequent snapshots
correspond to the different multicellular bioelectrical states obtained
when the patch rate rmo is increased from 0.1 to 0.5 min–1, with rp = 0.2 min–1 and a fixed intercellular conductance Go/Gdep = 0.5 in the whole
ensemble. The spatio-temporal maps of potentials are obtained for
a fixed number of cells Np = 55 in the
patch and a total number of cells N = 304 in the
multicellular domain. Other conditions and parameters are the same
as those of Figure 4.

Taking together, the simulation
results of Figures 4 and 5 show the counterbalancing
effect caused by the stable polarized membrane potentials
of the distant cells on the stable depolarized potentials
of those cells localized in the patch, suggesting a binary short-/long-range control of the patch membrane potentials
that can be regulated by the intercellular connectivity. Therefore,
the long-distance transduction of electrical signals through dynamic gap junctions shows that the bioelectrical state
of individual cells within a small group can be influenced at the ensemble level by a majority of surrounding cells.35

It must be mentioned that in real cases,
the long-distance regulatory
mechanisms also typically involve the spatio-temporal distribution
of signaling ions and molecules such as calcium, butyrate, and serotonin.2,4,19 This effect is not explicitly
accounted for in the model, but the fact is that the local concentrations
of these ions and molecules are influenced by time-dependent maps
of electric potentials similar to those described here.19 For instance, the membrane potentials of Xenopus embryos hyperpolarized cells have been found
to influence a distant tumorigenic site with oncogene-expressing cells.56 In this case, the butyrate influx into these
cells and subsequent inhibition of histone deacetylase resulted in
tumor cell proliferation arrest and the reduction of tumorlike structures.56 Although these fluxes are not explicitly accounted
for in the model, we believe that the results of Figures 2–5 should be of biological significance because of the following facts:(i) Biological clocks are involved in processes such as development
and homeostasis. In
particular, oscillations with a periodicity shorter than 24 h are
emerging as biophysical mechanisms that can coordinate cellular responses
and cell fate decisions.57 At the multicellular
level, however, the above processes must be coordinated efficiently
across large distances, which is difficult to achieve by simple molecular
diffusion. Our simulations explore the spatio-temporal consequences
of coupling together biochemical and bioelectrical cell characteristics
over multicellular ensembles, complementing thus the biochemical traveling
wave approach previously proposed for the dynamics of different signaling
pathways.58

(ii) Oscillatory bioelectric signals alternating
polarization and depolarization in the patch can be
maintained only for optimal values of the intercellular coupling.
Therefore, the cross talk between the patch and the rest of the domain
leading to the oscillations may be abolished by taking the cellular
connectivity outside the oscillatory region of Figure 3. Experimentally, this can be achieved, for
example, by external blocking agents41 or
by genetic disruption26 of the gap junction
communication.

(iii) Ion
channels have traditionally
been regarded as information processing units at the single-cell
level only. However, the bioelectrical oscillations described
here emerge as collective phenomena because of the coupling between
the single-cell (Figure 1, left) bioelectric and genetic descriptions at the multicellular
level (Figure 1, right). Note that we have not assumed here any periodic variation
for the biological magnitudes characteristic of the single cell. It
is the average electric potential resulting from
the intercellular coupling that makes the cells to act as an oscillating
multicellular patch in the model. This fact is evident from the significant
role played by the number of interacting cells (Figure 2a) and the intercellular coupling degree
(Figure 2c) in the
patch.

(iv) The collective
nature of our simulation
results immediately suggests that the combination of local
genetic prepatterns with dynamic gap junctions may allow implementing distributed biological memories via spatio-temporal maps of cell potentials, a
question of experimental significance.26 Note in this context that the local position of the cells within
the patch is not sufficient to establish their bioelectrical
state in Figures 4 and 5, rather it is the long-range communication with
the remaining outer cells that determines the patch multicellular
outcome (depolarized–oscillatory–polarized). In Figure 4, it
is the dynamic evolution of the gap junctions that allows implementing different bioelectrical patterns with the same genetic prepattern, which suggests that different spatio-temporal
maps can be dynamically established and maintained by modulating the
intercellular coupling.1,2,26



Conclusions
There are clear experimental
motivations for the model simulations
described here. For instance, bioelectrical oscillations modulated
by different ion channels are observed in glioma cells,21 β-cells in pancreatic islets,25 bacterial communities,22,23 and multicellular domains in the heart.24 In the latter case, bioelectrical signals can influence cardiac
function and modify the gene expression of extracellular matrix components.59 Experimentally, spatio-temporal bioelectric
patterns can be monitored, for example, by a protein whose fluorescence
intensity varies with the electric potential across the membrane.29,60 In particular, fluorescent membrane-potential indicators show the
significance of bioelectric patterning during oogenesis in Drosophila ovarian follicles.61 Also, the central role played by particular channels can be demonstrated
by effectively abolishing their electrical activity using specific
pharmacological inhibitors.21 In general,
the bioelectrical control of multicellular ensembles can be attempted
by targeting specific ion channel and gap junction proteins at the
transcriptional and post-translational levels.2,4,5,9,14−16,26,36,41 Although different
drugs targeting ion channels have been approved for human use, a serious
limitation is that externally modifying the membrane potential could
have unexpected effects on the cellular microenvironment.8

The simulations presented here show that
a small number of cells
within a multicellular domain can act as a single oscillatory population
for optimal levels of intercellular coupling, suggesting collective
regulatory mechanisms of single-cell polarization states.2,4,19 The physical basis for this regulation
is the system-level bioelectrical response to local genetic
changes: the oscillations in the patch arise because every
single-cell state is determined not only by the individual potential Vi but also by the potential
difference Vj – Vi relative to the neighboring
cells j (Figure 1, right). This theoretical prediction has an experimental
basis2,3,19,26 and suggests that some bioelectrical control of multicellular
patches should be possible, as opposed to the need of acting on each
cell individually. In this context, we must note that biomechanical
oscillations in cell monolayers can also show a collective dynamics
regulation.62 In our case, the external
regulation and collective control of depolarized/polarized cell states
should be of biological significance because of the instructive role
of membrane potentials in cell proliferation and differentiation,6−8 the plasticity of predifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells,9 and regeneration processes.4

Recent experiments on model animals have also related
bioelectrical
oscillations with long-range information processing in nonexcitable
cells,26 showing that the electric potentials
of distant cells can reverse local processes by long-distance signaling.55 Unfortunately, the oversimplified model used
here does not allow a direct comparison with real biological systems.
However, the simulations suggest that genetic prepatterns, established,
for example, by the distribution of signaling molecules over the ensemble,
acting in concert with intercellular connectivity can produce maps
of electric potentials that can be useful as information processing
mechanisms for multicellular outcomes.

Note finally that the
model implicitly assumes that the electrical
potential maps may influence the single-cell transcription processes
because of the feedback between the genetic and the bioelectrical
levels of description (Figure 1). In this way, individual cells could display different memories
stored in the form of distinct bioelectrical states (Figure 3) that could be retrieved by
appropriate changes in the spatial distribution of the signaling molecules
that regulate specific rate constants (Figure 5) and the intercellular communication (Figure 4). Future work currently
in progress will explore the interplay between genetic prepatterns
of ion channel expression and the remodeling of the
intercellular connectivity as possible mechanisms for establishing distributed memories in ensembles of non-neural cells.
