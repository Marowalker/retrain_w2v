An in-house UV lithography setup
has been optimized to fabricate
low-cost disposable electrochemical sensing Cu electrodes using a
copper clad board. In view of the high oxidation probability of copper,
the low-cost electrodes were modified using different gold nanostructures
and a conducing polymer PEDOT:PSS to attain maximal signal output
and improved shelf-life. Zero-dimensional (0D) gold nanoparticles
(∼40 nm) and three-dimensional (3D) gold nanoflowers (∼38
nm) mixed with PEDOT:PSS were used as signal-enhancing conductors
for the ultrasensitive detection of our model contaminant, methylene
blue dye (MB). The bare copper electrode was sensitive to MB, linearly
within the range of 4–100 μM, with a limit of detection
of 3.49 μM. While for gold nanoparticle-PEDOT:PSS-modified electrode,
the sensitivity of the electrode was found to increase linearly in
the range of 0.01–0.1 μM, and for gold nanoflowers-PEDOT:PSS,
the sensitivity achieved was 0.01–0.1 μM with the LOD
as 0.0022 μM. For a PEDOT:PSS-modified Cu electrode, used as
a comparative to study the contributing role of gold nanostructures
towards improved sensitivity, the linearity was found to be in the
range of 0.1–1.9 μM with the LOD as 0.0228 μM.
A 6 times improvement in signal sensitivity for the nanoflower-PEDOT:PSS
electrode compared to the nanoparticle-PEDOT:PSS-modified electrode
indicates the influence of nanoparticle shape on the electrode efficiency.
3D gold nanoflowers with a large surface area-to-volume ratio and
a high catalytic activity prove to be a superior choice for electrode
modification.

Introduction
Conventional environmental
monitoring practices based on discrete
sample collection followed by extensive laboratory analysis procedures
are expensive and time-consuming and have limited detection resolution.1 Thus, developing a real-time analysis methodology
which is rapid, inexpensive, and yet capable of sensitive detection
is desirable. Chemical sensors, specifically electrochemical, have
been used for on-site environmental monitoring of various parameters
such as organic pollutants (pesticides), biomolecules,
trace elements, and pH among others.2−7 Development of an electrochemical sensing technology yet continues
to grow rapidly, to meet the challenges posed by new environmental
and clinical analytes. An electrochemical sensor offers selectivity,
portability, opportunity for miniaturization, and limited space and
power requirements.8−10

Sensitivity of any electrochemical sensor majorly
comes from a
robust and efficient electrode system since the electrical signal
derived from the analytical input is an outcome of the analyte–recognition
interaction on the sensing electrode. Traditional electrodes such
as gold, platinum, or glassy carbon are excellent conductors and highly
sensitive systems yet limited owing to their high fabrication and
operational cost. Conductive polymers and their composites were extensively
used previously to modify and improve the electrode surfaces, finding
an abundant mention in the literature.11,12 Some common
examples include monomers of aniline, gallic acid, and pyrene among
others.13−15 The electronic transfer efficiency, a marker of electrode
output, was often found mediocre owing to the ineffective charge transfer
between the electrode surface and the polymer backbone, instilling
the need for improved electrodes. Progressively, Nafion-coated electrode
surfaces were fabricated for improved signal transductions. Nafion
coatings containing terminal sulfonic showed a promising selectivity
toward biomolecules and were developed as a potential catecholamine
detector with clinical significance.16 The
high cost and nonuniversal application limited their use.

With
the advent of the nanoscale technology, electrochemical sensor
electrode systems saw an upgradation with reduced costs, higher sensitivities,
enhanced biocompatibility, precise targeting, and multiplexing abilities.17−21 Contributed by the faster electron kinetics, improved conductivity
and high surface area for enhanced redox activity made them an attractive
alternative. Different classes of nanomaterials ranging from carbon-based,
semiconductors, quantum dots, nanofibers, etc. have found acceptance
as electrode material base or modifier.22−24 Metal nanoparticles,
one of the most widely used nanomaterials toward modified transducers,
have an excellent catalytic property and a high affinity for chemical
and biofunctionalization, qualifying as efficient electrochemical
accessories. Graphene, the single-carbon graphitic structure, with
excellent thermal stability and excellent conductivity also makes
an excellent electrode material. Martin and co-workers developed graphene
nanoribbons on screen-printed surfaces as a potential electrochemical
sensor for uric acid determination. The developed nanoribbon electrodes
were fast (100 s), sensitive (at +0.35 V), and inexpensive (disposable).25 Test systems aside, the actual use of graphene
is limited by its tendency to aggregate and deficiency of electrochemically
active defect sites with respect to its application toward sensing
biomolecules. Supported by high isoelectric points, nontoxicity, spectrum
of morphologies, and the respective physical and chemical properties
make ZnO a potential suitable electrode; however, the commercial production
and sensor fabrication reproducibility of ZnO prohibit its real-time
use.26 Improved printing technologies and
lithography attracted enough attention for the fabrication of low-cost
electrodes and also functional devices using plastic or even paper
as substrate. For example, Määttänen et al. generated
a paper-based electrochemical chip capable of exhibiting comparable
performance to a conventional electrochemical cell.27 Cellulose membranes functionalized with gold nanoparticles
printed with ink-jet printers have been synthesized by immersing them
in a plating solution of HAuCl4 and NH2OH until
conducting electrode structures were formed.28 A large material consumption, need of pattern stencil, and a high
human expertise can be considered as its major drawbacks for widespread
application. Moreover, solid substrate electrodes are often restrictive
for reuse due to the gradual fouling of the electrode surface, consequently
from the absorption of reaction byproducts, products, or contaminants
in the case of crude samples.29−31 Also, solute sensing is often
subdued due to hampered electron transfer because of inappropriate
electrode material, alleviating the need to design better electrode
systems.

In this work, a cost-effective, disposable, ultrasensitive
microelectrode
array was fabricated using an in-house UV lithography setup. The copper
clad board serves as the solid substrate of high conductivity and
low cost. The in-house lithography setup consisted of a 311 nm UV
CFL (9 W) as the illumination source for pattern transfer and some
transparency sheets, which were used as the positive photoresist.
The masks and patterns were generated in three simple steps, precisely
(1) coating of positive photoresist, (2) exposure to UV light for
pattern transfer, and (3) removal of excess unexposed region. Since
Cu, our base electrode material, is prone to oxidation, the conductive
polymer PEDOT:PSS has been coated onto the electrode surface to limit
fouling, while to increase the electrode sensitivity, the electrodes
were modified using gold nanostructures. The developed gold nanostructure-modified
Cu electrodes were used to detect the presence of methylene blue (MB)
dye in water. MB is a potent carcinogen, retards the growth of aquatic
flora and fauna, and is also one of the most common effluents of textile
industries causing water pollution. Electrochemical operations on
gold nanoparticle-PEDOT:PSS and gold nanoflower-PEDOT:PSS electrodes
were found to be superior compared to bare Cu or PEDOT:PSS electrodes
alone. Among the gold nanostructures as well, the 3D anisotropic gold
nanoflowers proved to be a better electrode modifier compared to spherical
particles. An approximately 6 times higher signal sensitivity was
attained for electrodes modified with gold nanoflower-PEDOT:PSS.

Results
and Discussion
Nanostructure Characterization
The
synthesized nanostructures
were characterized using a UV–visible spectrophotometer and
a transmission electron microscope (TEM) before its application in
sensing studies. Optical properties of the synthesized samples, both
GNP and GNF, were studied using UV–vis spectroscopy. The plots
are presented in Figure 1a,b. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peaks for both gold
nanoparticles and nanoflowers were clearly observed in the characteristic
visible-region wavelength range (520–580 nm), which indicates
a successful gold nanostructure synthesis. Notably, for nanoparticles,
only a single narrow intense peak at 530 nm is observed, while for
nanoflowers, a set of two unequal broad peaks are observed. The first
peak, observed near 586 nm, is broader and more intense compared to
the second minor peak observed in the far visible region around 742
nm. From the literature, the origins of these two peaks have been
related to the center and terminals of the anisotropic nanostructures,
respectively.32,33

and SAED pattern of
gold nanoparticles (a–c) and gold nanoflowers (d–f),
respectively.

To confirm our UV–visible
observations, the samples were
characterized using TEM. As seen in Figure 1b,e, we could conclude the successful synthesis
of nanospheres and nanoflowers, respectively. As observed in Figure 1b, spherical gold
nanoparticles with nearly monodisperse population were formed. Their
surface was found to be smooth, and the average size was calculated
to be 20 ± 4 nm. While, for the gold nanoflower sample (Figure 1e), irregular 3D
structures with small petal-like protrusions arising from the center
were obtained. Each nanostructure was seen to comprise minor grooves
at the terminal, giving it a flowerlike appearance. A distinct contrast
difference between the structure center and tips was observed, which
is ascribed to the difference of metal thickness at the core compared
to termini. The average nanoflower size was estimated to be 38 ±
5 nm. The selected area electron diffraction pattern was generated
to gather insights into the growth planes of the synthesized nanostructures.
As observed in Figure 1c,f for both nanoparticles and nanoflowers, the SAED patterns comprised
small bright spots, which were arranged in circular ringlike patterns,
indicating the polycrystalline nature of the synthesized structures.
The SAED pattern data analysis for nanoparticles indexes growth planes
as [111] and [200], while for nanoflowers, the diffractions match
the [111, 200, 220] and [311] planes of cubic gold.34

Electrode Characterization
Photolithographically
fabricated
electrodes were washed with deionized water and hard-baked at 55–65
°C for half an hour. After that, the prepared electrodes were
observed under a microscope to investigate their surface. As observed
from the images obtained from the microscope at 10× magnification
(Figure 2a–c),
both the linear and curved sections of the structure patterned on
the substrate were regular, homogeneous, and smooth.

electrodes as obtained from the linear and curved sections of the
pattern.

Electrochemical Impedance
Spectroscopy (EIS) Measurements of
the Nanostructure-Functionalized Cu Electrodes
Impedance
measurements for all of the four different electrodes, namely, bare
Cu, PEDOT:PSS, GNP-PEDOT:PSS, and GNF-PEDOT:PSS, were performed. The
obtained graphs for the same are presented in Figure 3. For the bare Cu electrode (Figure 3a), a nonsemicircular curve
is obtained, indicating an uninhibited electron transfer but a high
internal resistance. However, when the bare Cu electrode was modified
with PEDOT:PSS, the nature of the curve transformed into a semicircle
(Figure 3b). This characteristic
semicircular curve reflects the increased input impedance by PEDOT:PSS
on account of the increased resistance in electron transfer by the
conductive polymer. To limit the increasing impedance value, gold
nanostructures (GNP/GNF) were mixed with the polymer and drop-cast
onto the electrodes. The impedance graph for the gold nanostructure-modified
electrodes is presented in Figure 3c,d. The nature of the graph for the modified electrodes
was yet semicircular but less steeper compared to bare PEDOT:PSS,
which points to the increase in the electric current flow. Among the
two different nanostructures used to modify the electrode, GNF were
found to show a smaller input impedance compared to GNP, indicating
a lesser resistance to electron transfer in GNF.

electrode, and (d) Cu/GNF-PEDOT:PSS-modified electrode in 0.1 M PBS
(pH 7) with 0.01 M KCl.

Effect of pH
To
study the effect of pH on the fabricated
electrode, cyclic voltammetry was done in phosphate buffer with varying
pH, in the presence of MB as a model electrochemical dye. We can see
from Figure S1 that the anodic peak current
increases with increasing pH and exhibits the maximum value at pH
9. At pH below 6, there are two H+ ions involved in the
electrode reaction,35 due to which several
peaks were observed in response to MB and high oxidation of Cu electrode
at acidic pH increased the complexity of electrochemical reaction
and decreased the sensitivity. Within pH 6–9, a prominent single
anodic and cathodic peak corresponds to the involvement of single
proton and two electrons in the reversible oxidation reduction process,
similarly to that reported by several authors.35−37 Some others
also reported phosphate buffer with alkaline pH as the best electrolyte
for estimation of MB.36,38 A change in the position of anodic
and cathodic peak potential with increasing pH was also observed,
and the shifting of the anodic peak potential toward the less positive
potential determines that the oxidation of MB is easy at alkaline
pH. A systematic shift of the reduction peak potential with change
in pH suggested the involvement of proton during electron transfer.39 The shift in the anodic peak potential with
pH follows the regression equation as Epa = 0.08078–0.03499 pH with the correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.99408) supporting our hypothesis of the
involvement of two electrons and one proton in the electrochemical
reaction.37 However, we proceed our further
work at pH 7 ± 0.4.

Effect of Scan Rate
The effect of
scan rate was investigated
by varying the scan rate in the range of 0.01–0.05 V/s (Figure S2a), and it was found that with increasing
scan rate, the current is increased because at higher scan rate, the
diffusion layer gets decreased.40,41 The oxidation peak
current when plotted against the square root of scan rate in the presence
of 100 μM MB (Figure S2b) shows a
linear increase with correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.994). From the result, it can be deduced that the reaction
is quasi-reversible and involves freely diffusing redox species.42

Effect of Mode
Figure S3 demonstrates the comparison in modes for MB detection
by a modified
electrode using cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in the presence of 100 μM
MB in 0.1 M PBS + 0.01 M KCl. The peak currents obtained in response
to 100 μM MB were 4.43, 9.54, and 28.649 μA for CV, LSV,
and DPV, respectively. An exquisite performance of the modified electrode
for MB sensing was found by DPV, with enhanced current response and
peak-to-peak separation with minimum background current. Although
DPV is a more sensitive method than CV, CV plays a key role in understanding
and deducing the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction of MB.43

Electrochemical Performance of Developed
Sensor in Terms of
Quantitative Analysis of MB by DPV
DPV was used as an analytical
tool to measure the sensitivity of fabricated sensors. It has benefits
over the CV because of its higher sensitivity and peak-to-peak separation
due to the relatively short pulse time and differential nature.

First, the measurement was performed with the bare Cu electrode (Figure 4a) over the concentration
range of 1–100 μM, and it was found that the reduction
peak current was linear in the range of 4–100 μM with
regression coefficient R2 = 0.9917 (Figure 4b) and limit of detection
(LOD) = 3.49 μM. When the Cu electrode was modified with PEDOT:PSS,
sensitivity was increased and the linear range was obtained from 0.1
to 1.9 μM (Figure 4c) with regression coefficient R2 = 0.9991
(Figure 4d) having
an LOD of 0.0228 μM. Further, the DPV was performed with GNF-PEDOT:PSS-modified
electrode in the concentration range of 0.001–0.1 μM
(Figure 5a). Although
some reduction current was obtained with 0.001 μM addition of
the MB, it was not in the linear range. The linear range was obtained
between 0.01 and 0.1 μM with regression coefficient R2 = 0.99877 (Figure 5b) and an LOD of 0.0022 μM. To distinguish
the role of nanostructure over the presence of nanomaterial, GNP-PEDOT:PSS
modification was also performed and the result of DPV toward MB was
evaluated in the range of 0.001–0.1 μM (Figure 5c). The linear range of reduction
peak current was obtained between 0.01 and 0.1 μM with regression
coefficient R2 = 0.9959 (Figure 5d) and an LOD of 0.0052 μM.
The peak current values reported above from DPV are blank-corrected
for best linear fit and to deduce the true value of intercept in the
regression equation.44−46 The LOD was calculated by the formula (3 × δ/slope),
where δ represents the standard deviation and the slope was
inferred from linear regression equation.47−50

Both the nanomaterial fabricated sensors were following the extreme
linearity in the range of 0.01–0.1 μM, but the LOD value
for the GNF-PEDOT:PSS-modified electrode is very low, i.e., 0.0022
μM, which is 2.36 times lower than that of the GNP-PEDOT:PSS-modified
electrode; moreover, the ratio of the slope in between these two nanostructure-modified
sensors was 6.54 (Figure 6) and reduction current obtained is also more in the case
of GNF-PEDOT:PSS-modified electrode. This might be due to the presence
of petals in GNF, which increases the surface area to the utmost level
and increases the catalytic property and therefore drives faster the
electron transfer kinetics. (After interpreting all of these data,
we are inferring that the proposed sensor fabricated with GNF-PEDOT:PSS
is highly sensitive toward MB.)

Reproducibility, Reusability Test of Nanostructure-Modified
Photolithographically Fabricated Electrode
The reusability
test was performed in 0.1 M PBS with 0.01 M KCl in the presence of
10 μM MB for reproducibility of the fabricated sensor (Figure 7), and DPV of the
proposed sensor was recorded after a good wash and sonication for
2 min. Five repetitive scans with washing of the modified electrode
were recorded, and after analyzing the data, a relative standard deviation
of 0.65% was found. Study revealed that PEDOT:PSS stabilized the GNF/GNP
very successfully over the electrode surface and increased the conductivity
as well. After analyzing all of these results, it was found that our
proposed sensors show a quite high performance in the sense of economic
ability, sensitivity, and multiusability over the already reported
sensors for MB (Table 1).

Conclusions
A
highly efficient yet simple and cost-effective method based on
photolithography (UV-assisted) for the fabrication of disposable electrochemical
sensing electrodes has been developed. The cost-effective copper clad
board served as the base electrode, which was modified using gold
nanostructures in combination with the conductive PEDOT:PSS to limit
copper oxidation (Figure S5), attain high
sensitivity, and maintain a continuous electric flow. Two different
morphologies of gold nanostructures were used, namely, spherical particles
and anisotropic flowers to modify the electrode surface, and tested
for MB detection from spiked water. The electrodes modified with gold
nanostructures were observed to show a better detection efficiency
compared to a bare copper electrode. The nanoparticle-PEDOT:PSS-modified
electrode could achieve sensitivity in the range of 0.01–0.1
μM, while the nanoflower-PEDOT:PSS electrode was found to be
sensitive in the range of 0.01–0.1 μM. The GNF-PEDOT:PSS
electrode was found to show 6 times improved signal sensitivity compared
to the GNP-PEDOT:PSS setup. The superlative signal sensitivity for
the nanoflower electrode was ascribed to their improved electronic
and catalytic properties along with the high surface area.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The copper clad board (CCB) was purchased
from a regular vendor in the local market. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III)
trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), ferric chloride,
and PEDOT:PSS (1%) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, while sodium
hydroxide, trisodium citrate, l-ascorbic acid, dipotassium
hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and potassium
chloride were purchased from Fischer Scientific. Our model contaminant
methylene blue (MB) was bought from SRL India Pvt. Ltd. Absolute ethanol
was procured from Merck. A positive photoresist was obtained from
Shipley Company s1800. All of the chemicals were of analytical grade
and used as obtained. All of the aqueous solution was prepared in
Milli-Q water, unless mentioned otherwise.

Gold Nanostructures Synthesis
Gold nanostructures with
spherical and flowerlike morphologies were obtained using the chemical
reduction method. The synthesis protocol was optimized by our group
previously.54 Briefly, for gold nanoflower
(GNF) synthesis, 10 mM HAuCl4 was added to 70 mL of 19.8
mM ice-cold l-ascorbic acid under a high stirring rate (1000
rpm). The reaction mixture almost instantaneously turns faint blue,
indicating the formation of anisotropic nanoparticles. For spherical
particles (GNP), 50 mL of a 2.5 mM aqueous solution of sodium citrate
was heated to bring it to boiling temperature. Once bubbles begin
to form, 1 mL of HAuCl4 was added to the above reaction
mixture and left undisturbed to react for the next 10 min. The color
of the reaction mixture changes from colorless to wine red, which
indicates reaction completion. The nanoparticle colloidal solution
was cooled down to room temperature prior to storage. The samples
were appropriately labeled and stored at 4 °C until further use.

Fabrication of Microelectrode
Array (MEA) by In-House Photolithography
Setup
The copper clad board was washed sequentially with
a mild soap and Milli-Q water. To minimize any chance of artifacts,
the cleaned board was rinsed thoroughly with absolute alcohol and
air-dried in a hot-air oven for 10 min at 60 °C prior to use.
Upon complete drying, the CCB was coated with the positive photoresist
(30 μL) using the Arduino microcontroller-driven spin coater
comprising a stepper motor. The coated copper clad slide was soft-baked
at 90 °C on a hot plate for 90 s (Figure 8). Using Microsoft Paint, the desired mask
pattern was designed and then printed on transparency sheets, as shown
in Figure 9a. Following
the mask patterning, the mask was exposed to a 9 W 311 nm UV illuminating
source to allow its transfer onto the CCB. UV light helps in breaking
the cross-link on the photoresist, allowing the shifting of pattern
on the board. The pattern-carrying slides were then washed with 4
and 5% NaOH solution simultaneously for a few seconds to fix the patterns
onto the board. Since the photoresist is positive, upon UV exposure,
chemical bonds in the photoresist lack stability, leading to their
disintegration. The patterns can be seen clearly in the mask-covered
area for subsequent processing (Figure 9b). To retain the pattern onto the board, wet etching
was performed using 30% FeCl3. Complete removal of the
photoresist was done in absolute ethanol to get the desired electrode
patterns (Figure 9c).

Modification of the Electrodes
with Gold Nanostructures
The fabricated MEAs were cleaned
with distilled water followed by
ultrasonic cleaning in ethanol for 10 min. After drying the electrodes
at room temperature, 1 μL of the nanostructure-PEDOT:PSS colloidal
solution (1:1) was drop-cast on the electrodes and allowed to dry
in a hot-air oven at 70 °C for 5 min. The drop-casting step was
repeated twice. The scanning electron micrograph images of bare and
modified Cu electrodes are shown in Figure 9e–g.

Electrochemical Measurements
For CV measurements, the
voltammograms were taken in a potential range of −1 to +1 V
(vs Ag/AgCl); after that, a potential window was chosen between −0.5
and 0.3 V, with a step potential of 2.4 mV and a scan rate of 30 mV/s.
All parameters were optimized for the best response. For impedance
measurement, the frequency was chosen between 100 KHz and 0.01 Hz
along with the number of frequencies as 50, amplitude as 0.01 V, and
applied potential as 0.2 V/s. For differential pulse voltammetry,
the potential was kept between −0.45 and 0.2 V, with step potential
as 0.005 V, modulation amplitude as 0.025 V, modulation time as 0.05
s, modulation interval as 0.5 s, and scan rate as 0.01 V/s. For the
measurement of MB, DPV was performed with the bare Cu electrode, the
PEDOT:PSS-coated Cu electrode, and the GNF/GNP-PEDOT:PSS composite-modified
as working electrode in 10 mL of 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) in 0.01 M KCl.

Characterization and Instrumentation
Optical characteristics
of the synthesized gold nanostructures were studied using a Lambda
25 UV–visible absorption spectrophotometer. The nanostructure
morphology and crystalline planes were analyzed using transmission
electron micrographs, and selected area diffraction (SAED) patterns
were obtained on a JEOL 2100F TEM operated at a voltage of 200 kV.
Electrochemical measurements, i.e., differential pulse voltammetry
and impedance, were performed via the PGSTAT 204 electrochemical workstation
(75 W 50/60 Hz made in the Netherlands) with a conventional three-electrode
system connected with a system with NOVA 1.11 software. Cu MEA fabricated
by photolithography were used as the working electrode, a platinum
sheet (5 mm × 5 mm) was used as the counter electrode, and an
Ag/AgCl electrode purchased from BASi was used as the reference electrode.
The electrochemical impedance measurement was performed in 0.01 M
KCl, and cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry were
performed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) with 0.01 M
KCl.
