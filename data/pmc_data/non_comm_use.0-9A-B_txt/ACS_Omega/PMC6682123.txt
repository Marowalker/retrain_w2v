This work describes
a facile synthesis of polymer-capped silver
nanoparticles at room temperature. Chitosan oligosaccharide lactate-capped
silver nanoparticles (COL-AgNPs) show the surface plasma resonance
(SPR) band at 400 nm. The color of the COL-AgNPs was observed to be
brownish yellow. The synthesized COL-AgNPs are stable for 5 months.
The COL-AgNPs were characterized by UV–vis, X-ray diffraction,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), mass, and
Fourier transform infrared spectral techniques. The obtained COL-AgNPs
are monodispersed, and the range of the particle diameter was calculated
to be 16.37 ± 0.15 nm by HR-TEM. We have utilized the COL-AgNPs
as a probe to sense iodide (I–). The SPR band of
COL-AgNPs was decreased after the addition of iodide, and the color
of the solution changed to colorless. Based on the decreases in SPR
band absorbance, the concentration of iodide was calculated. The detection
limit was found to be 108.5 × 10–9 M (S/N =
3). Other interferences (825- and 405-fold) did not interfere with
the detection of 1.48 × 10–6 M iodide. The
sensing mechanism was also discussed. Finally, we have successfully
applied our sensing system for the detection of iodide in tap water,
river water, pond water, blood serum, urine, and food samples. Good
recoveries are obtained with spiked iodide in the real samples. Importantly,
we have developed a paper-based kit using wax-printed paper for the
on-site monitoring of iodide. The developed paper-based kit absorbance
was validated with the microplate reader. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report that used six different real samples for
the detection of iodide and development of the paper-based kit for
on-site monitoring.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Iodide
plays a vital role in metabolism and neurological activities.
It is involved in the development of bones, muscles, and thyroid functions.
Thyroid cells absorb iodide from food and then combine with amino
acid to prepare T3 and T4 thyroid hormones.1,2 These
thyroid hormones, which will be released into the blood and circulated
throughout the body, are involved in several metabolic reactions.
Therefore, the presence of iodide in food and water is very important
for the normal function of the thyroid gland. Millions of people are
affected by iodide deficiency globally, which is known as hypothyrodism.3,4 On the other hand, an excess of iodine present in our body is called
hyperthyrodism. Hypo- and hyperthyrodism can cause goiter, anxiety,
nervous agitation in dementia, confusion, circulatory system disorders,
agitation, and weight loss.5−7 These deficiencies also can cause
mental defects, spontaneous abortion, and an increased number of infant
deaths.8−10 Iodide deficiency can be prevented by ensuring optimal
iodide intake from food and medicine.11 The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that the daily
intake of iodide is 150 μg/day.12,13 Therefore,
the detection of iodide using a simple protocol with high sensitivity
and selectivity is very important for both physiological and environmental
impact.14,15

Recently, there have been many reports
available for the detection
of iodide, such as voltammetry,16 fluorescence,17 flame atomic absorption spectrometry,18 gas chromatography–mass spectrometry,19 ion chromatography,20 etc. Nevertheless, these methods have some demerits, which include
a long measuring time, lengthy procedure, high-cost instrument, etc.
On the other hand, a spectrophotometric detection method has gained
momentum due to its simple experimental setup, high sensitivity, and
less time-consumption.21 Recently, metal
nanoparticles have been extensively used for sensor applications.
For example, silver nanoparticles have received much attention because
of their simple synthesis, unique optical properties, ultrasmall size
and SPR band, etc.22,23

Further, AgNPs show good
conductivity, catalytic activity, chemical
stability, and are extensively used in sensor, food storage, and textile
industries.22,24 The size- and distance-dependent
SPR properties of AgNPs can help the researchers use it as a probe
for sensor applications.25,26 Chitosan oligosaccharide
lactate (COL) is a degradable biopolymer. It is used in several fields,
including water treatment, thin film and food industries, etc., due
to their biocompatibility, nontoxicity, and good aqueous solubility.27,28 Keeping these objectives in our minds, we have synthesized COL-capped
silver nanoparticles (COL-AgNPs) at room temperature. Then, the COL-AgNPs
were used as a probe for the selective detection of iodide. Further,
we have applied them to a developed system for the detection of iodide
in several real samples, including blood serum, urine, food, and water
samples. Importantly, the paper-based kit also was developed for on-site
monitoring of iodide.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Chemicals
Chitosan oligosaccharide
lactate, sodium borohydride, and silver nitrate were purchased from
Aldrich and were used as received. Potassium iodide, sodium chloride,
sodium fluoride, potassium bromide, potassium chloride, aluminum oxide,
sodium nitrate, potassium cyanide, sodium nitrite, hydrochloric acid,
sodium hydroxide, sodium sulfate, sodium thiosulfate, sodium acetate,
sodium carbonate, potassium thiocyanate, monosodium phosphate, and
disodium phosphate were purchased from Aldrich and used as received
without further purification. Magnesium acetate, iron(III) chloride,
iron(II) chloride, zinc sulfate, nickel sulfate, magnesium sulfate,
and copper nitrate were purchased from Fisher and used as received
without further purification. Dialysis tubes with a 29.3 mm diameter
and 3.5 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) were obtained from Fisher
Scientific. A phosphate buffer solution (pH 3.0 to pH 13) was prepared
with monosodium phosphate and disodium phosphate (0.2 M), further
adjusted with sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. All glassware
was thoroughly washed with (3:1 ratio of HCl/HNO3) aqua
regia and was then rinsed with ultrapure water prior to use. Ultrapure
water was used in all of the experiments.

2.2 Synthesis
of AgNPs
The COL-AgNPs
was synthesized by a wet-chemical method. Briefly, a 2 mL solution
of 0.01 M AgNO3 and 25 mL of water were added into a 50
mL beaker. The solution was allowed to be stirred vigorously for 5
min. Then, 3 mL of 1% chitosan oligosaccharide lactate was added and
allowed to be stirred for 5 min. Then, 0.3 mL of 0.25% NaBH4 was added into the above mixture. The solution immediately turns
into brownish yellow. After 5 min of stirring the COL-AgNPs, the solution
was centrifugated three times with 1000 rpm and washed with water.
Finally, the purified COL-AgNPs were stored at 4 °C.

2.3 Characterization of COL-AgNPs
Absorption
spectral studies are performed in a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV–vis
spectrophotometer. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were
recorded using a PerkinElmer Spectra 100 FT-IR spectrometer. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images and the EDX (energy dispersive X-ray)
spectrum were collected with a JEOL-2100 transmission electron microscope
that was operated at 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was
obtained from a Rigaku X-ray diffraction unit using Ni-filtered Cu
K (λ = 1.5406) radiation. A voltammetry experiment was carried
out in an HCHI instrument (U.S.A.), and glassy carbon, a Ag/AgCl electrode,
and platinum wire were used as working, reference, and counter electrodes,
respectively. Mass spectra were recorded, and GC–MS spectra
were measured on GC/MS systems (5977 series of Agilent Technology).
An electrospray ionization quiet time of the light mass spectrometry
measurement was performed by a Xevo G2-S-Q-TOF (U.S.A.) instrument
via a direct infusion method. Micoplate absorbance was recorded with
an EnSpire multilabel plate reader with Alpha Tech (PerkinElmer, U.S.A.,
2013).

2.4 Iodide Sensing Procedure
In a 3 mL
cuvette, 0.5 mL of COL-AgNPs and 1.5 mL (pH 7.2) of 0.2 M phosphate
buffer were taken (blank). In this mixture, a different concentration
of I– was added. After 10 min of reaction time,
the UV–vis spectrum was recorded, and the UV–vis spectral
scale was kept from 200 to 750 nm.

2.5 Real
Sample Analysis
Tap water was
collected from our institute. River and pond water were collected
from nearby places. The dust and small particles are removed by filtration
using Whatman filter paper. Similarly, the urine sample also was filtered
by Whatman filter paper. The blood serum sample was collected from
a nearby medical center and used without further purification. The
food sample of kelp (Laminaria japonica Aresch) was purchased from a local supermarket. Dried kelp (0.25
g) was burned to ash in which the existing iodine is converted into
iodide. Then, the burned ash was dissolved into boiling water. Then,
the solution was filtered by 0.2 μm filter paper. Finally, we
have spiked a known volume of the real sample into the COL-AgNPs and
recorded the UV–vis spectrum.

2.6 Paper-Based
Iodide Sensor
An Advantech
chromatography paper sheet (grade no.1, A4 sheet) was taken and fitted
into the solid ink printer (Xerox Color Qube 8570 wax printer). The
ink printer created the hydrophobic wax barriers on the paper. The
wax-printed paper was placed in a hot plate at 140 °C for 3 min,
which melted the wax and formed a hydrophobic barrier. After cooling
the wax-printed paper, 100 μL of COL-AgNPs was added into each
well and allowed to dry at room temperature for 20 min.29 Then, the I–-spiked river
water sample was added into a well of COL-AgNP-coated wax-printed
paper. Finally, the absorbance of each well area was measured using
a Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek) at 405 nm.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of COL-AgNPs
The COL-AgNPs were synthesized by an eco-friendly
and environmentally
friendly method at room temperature. The synthesized COL-AgNPs were
purified by centrifugation and dialysis methods. Then, the purified
COL-AgNPs were characterized by the following tecniques.

3.1.1 Absorption Spectrum and Stability of COL-AgNPs
The
synthesis of COL-AgNPs was monitored by a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The UV–vis spectrum of AgNO3 shows the absorbance
peak at 262 nm (Figure S1, curve a), and
COL exhibited the absorbance band at 280 nm (Figure S1, curve b). After mixing AgNO3 and COL, the absorbance
band shifted to 254 nm (Figure S1, curve
c). Then the addition of NaBH4 led to changing the solution
color from colorless to brownish yellow, and the SPR band was observed
at 400 nm, which successfully confirmed the formation of COL-AgNPs
(Figure S1, curve d). We have used COL
as a stabilizer to get the high stability of AgNPs.

Further,
we have monitored the stability of COL-AgNPs by a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
Interestingly, the 5 month aged COL-AgNPs had unaltered absorbance
and wavelength compared with freshly prepared COL-AgNPs (Figure 1B, curve a). The color of the solution
also was unaltered (Figure 1B, inset a) with freshly prepared and 5 month aged COL-AgNPs.

of COL-AgNPs. (B) UV–vis spectra of (a) freshly prepared and

(a) and (b) curves.

3.1.2 FT-IR
Spectra of COL and COL-AgNPs
The existing chemical functional
groups of COL and COL-capped AgNPs
were characterized by the FT-IR spectral technique. FT-IR spectra
of COL and COL-AgNPs are shown in Figure 2A(a and b), respectively. The FT-IR spectrum
of COL shows the characteristic peaks at 3325 and 2901 cm–1, which are corresponding stretching frequencies (ν) of OH
and NH, and symmetrical stretching frequencies (νs) of CH were observed at 2901 cm–1. The stretching
frequency peaks of NH were merged together with the OH peak.30 The stretching frequencies of C–O and
C–O–C were observed at 1606 and 1046 cm–1, respectively.31 The stretching frequency
(ν) of CH was observed at 1386 cm–1.28,32−34 Further, we have characterized the COL-capped AgNPs
by the FT-IR spectral technique. The FT-IR spectrum of COL-AgNPs shows
the similar FT-IR characteristic peaks of COL (Figure 2A(b)). It is expected that the −NH2 group of COL was adsorbed on the surface of AgNPs. As we
expected, the resolved NH peak intensity was decreased.28 These results confirmed the presence of COL
on the surface of AgNPs.

AgNPs. (B) XRD
pattern of COL-AgNPs.

3.1.3 HR-TEM Images and XRD Pattern of COL-AgNPs
The size, dispersity, and morphology were examined by high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images. Figure 3A shows the HR-TEM images with
different magnifications. The synthesized COL-AgNPs were observed
as spherical in nature and monodispersed by the HR-TEM image (Figure 3B). The average particle
diameter was calculated to be 16.37 ± 0.15 nm, which was calculated
using Image J software.

Figure 3 (A) HR-TEM image of COL-AgNPs with 50 nm magnification.
Inset:
crystal lattices of COL-AgNP. (B) HR-TEM image of COL-AgNPs with 20
nm magnification.

The obtained HR-TEM image
particle size has good agreement with
the particle size calculated by the XRD pattern Scherer equation (Figure 2B). Further, we have
observed a crystal lattice of COL-AgNPs by the HR-TEM image. The crystal
lattice distance was estimated to be 0.24 nm in size (Figure 3A, inset). The obtained lattice
distance confirmed the d-spacing of the silver lattice of the (111)
plane35 (JCPDS file no. 04–0783).
These results confirmed that the COL-AgNPs are crystalline in nature
and highly pure.

The XRD pattern of COL-AgNPs is shown in (Figure 2B). The crystalline
nature has been characterized
by XRD measurement. The XRD pattern of COL-AgNPs shows that the different
peaks are at (111) 38.17, (200) 44.20, (220) 64.28, (311) 77.51, and
(222) 81.81 planes.36 Among the different
XRD planes, the absorbed (111) peak is more intense than that of the
other planes. The intensity ratio between the (200) and (111) planes
was calculated to be 0.6, which is relevant in showing that the (111)
plane is predominant in the arrangement.

The crystalline size of
COL-AgNPs was calculated by the following
Scherer equation.23,36,37 1  where D is
the crystallite size of the AgNPs, λ is the wavelength of X-ray
wavelength, β is the full width half-length maximum of the (111)
plane, θ is the diffraction angle, and k is
a constant. The average size of COL-AgNPs was calculated to be 20.32
nm by the Scherer equation, which fairly matched with the particle
size obtained from the HR-TEM image.

3.1.4 Mass
Spectral Studies
The mass
spectrum of COL-AgNPs is shown (Figure S2). The fragment peaks are obtained at 525.18, 687.23, 848.34, 1008.27,
1169.27, 1330.63, 1420.43, 1632.54, 1805.69, 2250.35, 2500.02, 2750.34,
3000.56, 3455.76, 3690.35, 3750.63, 3954.54, 4257.84, and 4623.17 m/z (Figure S2). The obtained peaks are due to the fragmentation of COL (dimer,
trimer, tetramer, pentamer, hexamer, heptamer, and octamer). The obtained
mass spectral results fairly matched with the previous report.38−40 This mass spectral result confirmed that the COL is present on the
surface of AgNPs.

3.1.5 Effect of pH and Time
The effect
of pH and time on COL-AgNPs in the presence of iodide was monitored
with a UV–vis spectrophotometer using a phosphate buffer solution
(0.2 M). The pH of COL-AgNPs was fixed from pH 3 to pH 12 and mixed
with 1.48 × 10–6 M iodide. The SPR band was
observed at pH 3, and when we increased the pH from 4 to 12, we have
observed that the absorbance of the SPR band was enhanced from pH
4 to 7.2. Hence, COL-AgNPs are not stable in acidic pH because the
acidic environment can convert the AgNPs to Ag+ ions. Therefore,
the absorbances are less at pH 3 and 4 (Figure S3). When we go for natural pH, it is favored to form an AgI
complex; this is the reason that the absorbance was enhanced when
observed in neutral pH 7.2 (Figure S3).
The absorbance dramatically decreased at pH 8 (Figure S3). The observed absorption decrease was attributed
to the presence of excess OH, which led to decreased absorption through
the aggregation of NPs (Figure S3). Hence,
we have optimized the pH 7.2 as a suitable pH for I– sensing.

The effect of time on COL-AgNPs with the iodide graph
is shown in (Figure S4). We have monitored
the absorption of COL-AgNPs after the addition of 1.48 × 10–6 M (pH 7.2) at different time intervals. The absorption
was increased from 1 to 10 min and then became constant from 10 to
60 min (Figure S4). These results confirmed
that 10 min is sufficient to react iodide with AgNPs. Hence, we have
optimized the 10 min reaction time as the optimized incubation to
form AgI.

3.2 Spectrophotometric Detection
of Iodide
The interaction between iodide and COL-AgNPs was
monitored by a UV–vis
spectrophotometer. The UV–vis spectrum of COL-AgNPs exhibits
the SPR band at 400 nm (Figure 4, curve a), and the color of the solution is brownish yellow.
After the addition of 0.498 μM iodide, the absorption was decreased
at 400 nm, and, interestingly, a new hump appeared at 422.2 nm (Figure 4, curve b). With
the second addition 0.99 μM iodide, we let to decrease the absorption
of COL-AgNPs at 400 nm.

Figure 4 UV–vis spectra of COL-AgNPs in the presence
of different
concentrations of I–: (a) 0, (b) 0.498, (c) 0.998,
(d) 1.48, (e) 1.9, (f) 2.44, (g) 2.91, and (h) 3.38 × 10–6 M I– in PBS at pH 7.2. Inset: (i)
linearity plot and (ii) photographs of (left) before and (right) after
the addition of 3.38 × 10–6 M I–.

The obtained hump at 430 nm becomes
sharp (Figure 4, curve
c). While adding 1.48 μM iodide
(Figure 4, curve d),
the SPR band completely vanished, and the hump becomes a well-resolved
peak at 422.2 nm with a decrease in absorbance. The next addition
led to shifting the wavelength of the resolved peak obtained at 422.2
nm. However, the SPR band completely vanished (Figure 4, curves e–h, inset (i)). The color
of the solution also changed from brownish yellow to colorless (Figure 4, inset (ii)). It
is expected that the disappearance of the SPR band and appearance
of a new peak at 422.2 nm is due to the formation of AgI. The obtained
AgI peak at 422.2 nm perfectly matched with previous reports.7,13 Therefore, the solution color and UV–vis spectral changes
confirmed the formation of AgI. Based on the decrease in the SPR band
of COL-AgNPs, we have calculated the concentration of iodide. The
detection limit was calculated to be 108.5 × 10–9 M (S/N = 3), and good linearity was obtained from 498 nM to 2.28
μM iodide. Further, we have predicted the mechanism for the
formation of AgI from COL-AgNPs with the help of HR-TEM images and
DPV data.

The UV–vis spectrum of 0.5 M iodide (Figure S5) shows the absorption band at 226 nm.
On the other
hand, the UV–vis spectrum of 1% COL solution exhibits the absorption
broad band at 280 nm (Figure S6). We have
added the different concentrations of iodide into the COL solution
and monitored their absorption spectral changes (Figure S7). Interestingly, after the addition of different
concentrations from 7.4 to 43.1 μM iodide, we did not observe
any spectral changes of COL, but the iodide peak at 226 nm was increased.
These results revealed that the there is no interaction between the
COL and iodide. Therefore, the interaction was obtained between the
AgNPs and iodide. Therefore, we conclude that added COL here acts
as a stabilizing agent to protect the AgNPs from aggregation.

3.3 HR-TEM of COL-AgNPs in the Presence of Iodide
We have
characterized the COL-AgNPs after the addition of 1.48
× 10–6 M iodide by HR-TEM (Figure 5). The HR-TEM image COL-AgNPs
in the presence of iodide shows the slightly aggregated and smallest
particles. The particle size was calculated to be 4.61 ± 0.12
nm. The obtained small particles were expected due to the etching
effect of iodide ions on the COL-AgNPs.7 The aggregated particles size is 3.6-fold lower than the size of
COL-AgNPs (Figure 3). Further, the UV–vis spectral data of COL-AgNPs added with
iodide produces a new peak at 422.2 nm. Figure 5 (inset (i)) shows the HR-TEM image of COL-AgNP
in the presence of 1.48 × 10–5 M iodide. The
particle size was observed to be 4.61 nm. Interestingly, we have observed
the lattices. The lattice distance was estimated to be 0.35 nm, which
is higher than that of the lattice of COL-AgNPs (Figure 3A, inset). Further, the observed
lattice distance of 0.35 nm perfectly matched with the previous reports
of AgI.41,42

× 10–5 M iodide. Inset: (i) HR-TEM image and
(ii) EDX spectrum of COL-AgNPs
in the presence of 1.48 × 10–5 M iodide.

Moreover, we have analyzed the
element by EDX. The EDX spectrum
of COL-AgNPs in the presence 1.48 × 10–5 M
iodide is shown in Figure 5 (inset (ii)). The EDX spectrum revealed the strong signals
of silver at 3 KeV and iodide at 4 KeV. These results strongly confirmed
the formation of AgI. Further, these results perfectly match with
previous reports.43 Further, nitrogen,
carbon, and oxygen signals are due to the presence of the COL ligand.
The excess carbon and copper signals are obtained from the copper
grid. UV–vis spectral data (Figure 4), COL-AgNPs color changes (Figure 4, inset (ii)), differential
pulse voltammetry data (Figure 7), HR-TEM images in Figure 5 (inset (i)), and EDX spectral results (Figure 5, inset (ii)) strongly confirmed
the formation of AgI. Further, the abovementioned results perfectly
match with previous reports.

3.4 Effect of Interferences
The effect
of a coexisting ion is very impertinent for a new detection method
for iodide. We have taken common interferences of Br–, F–, Cl–, NO2–, NO3–, H2PO4–, SO4–, CN–, acetate (AC–), CO32, SCN–, Na+, K+, Fe3+, Al3+, and Fe2+. Interestingly, the
presence of 1.22 × 10–2 M (825-fold) of the
above mentioned common potential interference did not interact with
the detection of 1.48 × 10–6 M iodide (Figure 6A,B). However, the
6.0 × 10–3 M concentration of other metal ions
including Zn2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+ did not interfere with the detection
of (405-fold) 1.48 × 10–6 M iodide. Further,
the color of the solution of COL-AgNPs (Figure 6C,D) did not change after the addition of
interferences. However, even the addition of 1.48 ×10–6 M iodide led to changing the color of the AgNP solution from yellow
to colorless.

common interferences, including Br–, F–, Cl–, NO2–, NO3–, H2PO4–, SO4–, CN–, acetate

These results confirmed the use
of the obtained COL-AgNPs as a
novel probe for the highly selective detection of iodide. Even the presence of 825-
and 405-fold higher concentrations of abovementioned interferences
did not interfere with the detection of 1.48 × 10–6 M iodide.

3.5 Electrochemical Studies
of COL-AgNPs with
Iodide
Further, we have studied the interaction between COL-AgNPs
and iodide by a differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique (Figure 7). Exhibited by the DPV of COL-AgNPs is the presence and absence
of iodide. The COL-AgNPs exhibited the oxidation peak of Ag0 at 0.22 V (Figure 7, curve a).44,45 It is well known that the oxidation
peak of Ag0 will be shifted to the lower potential, and
the current intensity can be enhanced when AgNPs interact with iodide.7,44 The DPV of COL-AgNPs shows the Ag0 oxidation peak at
0.22 V. Interestingly, the addition of 0.5 μM iodide led to
shifting the peak from 0.22 to 0.09 V (Figure 7, curve b). The second addition of iodide
(2 μM) shows no peaks at 0.22 and 0.09 V (Figure 7, curve c). The new peak that appeared at
0.793 V is due to the conversion of AgI from Ag0 (Figure 7).7,46 The
appearance of a new peak at 0.793 V revealed the excess of iodide.
This result perfectly matches with the previous report.7 The electrochemical study has confirmed the formation
of AgI after the addition of iodide into COL-AgNPs.

Figure 7 (a) Recorded DPV of the
COL-AgNPs and after the addition of (b)
0.5 and (c) 2 μM iodide in 50 μM NaCl.

Based on the results obtained from UV–vis
spectral, HR-TEM
image lattice, EDX spectral, and electrochemical studies, we have
given the possible mechanism for the formation of AgI (Scheme 1).

3.6 Real Sample Analysis
The COL-AgNPs
was successfully applied for the detection of iodide in water samples
(tap water, river water, and pond water) and urine, blood serum, and
food (Kelp) samples. The water, blood serum, and urine samples did
not have iodide content. Then, we spiked a known amount of iodide
to the real sample, which led to the decrease of the SPR absorption
band. A good recovery was observed from 97 to 99.7% of those spiked
with iodide. The summarized result is shown in Table 1. These results confirmed that the COL-AgNPs
are a good probe for the detection of iodide in environment water,
urine, blood serum, and food samples.

3.7 Development of a Paper-Based Kit for On-Site
Monitoring of Iodide
The preparation procedure for COL-AgNP-coated
wax-printed paper is given in the experimental section. Tap water
samples of 20 μL containing known concentrations of iodide were
dropped onto the wax paper. For example, 20 μL of (a) 0, (b)
0.498, (c) 0.998, (d) 1.48, (e) 1.9, (f) 2.44, (g) 2.91, and (h) 3.38
× 10–6 M I– was added into
the COL-AgNP-coated wax-printed paper. Then, the paper was allowed
to dry at room temperature for 20 min. The COL-AgNPs contained in
wax-printed paper show the yellow color under daylight, whereas iodide-added
wells show the decrease of yellow color intensity. The observed color
change was ascribed to the formation of AgI (Figure 8A).

Figure 8 (A) COL-AgNP-modified wax-printed paper with
the addition of 20
μL of (a) 0, (b) 0.498, (c) 0.998, (d) 1.48, (e) 1.9, (f) 2.44,
(g) 2.91, and (h) 3.38 × 10–6 M I– in river water. Photographs were taken under daylight. Intensity
changes versus I– concentration on paper (each data
point represents an average of 3 separate measurements in 16-well
microplate paper platforms; 15 measurements were obtained for each
well). (B) Linearity was observed from 0 to 3.38 × 10–6 M iodide (R2 = 0.9905).

Further, the absorbance of modified wax-printed
paper was quantitized
by the microplate reader; each printed well was cut into a 2 cm2 area then the cut area was fixed into a separate well of
a 16-well microplate, and the absorbance was recorded at 405 nm wavelength.
We have measured 15 times in the well area. Good linearity was observed
from 0 to 3.38 × 10–6 M iodide (Figure 8B) (R2 = 0.9905).

The results confirmed that our paper-based
platform kit provides
advantage including low cost, a simple experimental step, test screening,
and a good ability for performing real-sample on-site monitoring of
iodide in biological and environmental samples. When compared with
the other reported nanoparticles for the detection of iodide, the
present method has several advantages, including 10 min reaction time,
low LOD, and physiological sensing pH. Six different real samples
were tested and a paper based kit was developed (Table 2).

4 Conclusions
We have developed a one-pot synthesis of
COL-AgNPs at room temperature.
The synthesized COL-AgNPs were well characterized by UV–vis,
FT-IR, XRD, HR-TEM, mass, and DPV methods. Then COL-AgNPs were used
as probes for detection. After the addition of iodide into the COL-AgNPs,
the color of the solution changed to colorless, and noticeable SPR
band changes were observed as well as the formation of AgI. The possible
mechanism also was discussed. Finally, the 825-fold excess of common
interferences including Br–, F–, Cl–, NO2–, NO3–, H2PO4–, SO4–, CN–, acetate
(AC–), CO32–,SCN–, Na+, K+, Fe3+, Al3+, and Fe2+ and 405-fold excess of common interferences
Zn2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+ did not interfere with the detection of 1.48
× 10–6 M iodide. This method was successfully
applied for the detection of iodide in biological (blood and urine),
food (kelp), and environmental (tap, river, and pond water) samples.
For the first time, we have developed a paper-based kit for on-site
monitoring of iodide, which was successfully validated with a microplate-reader
technique.
