Using self-consistent field (SCF)
calculations, we systematically
quantify the pair interactions between spherical diblock copolymer
micelles following a bottom-up approach. From the equilibrium properties
of self-assembling micelles at different separation distances, a simple
yet insightful pair interaction can be extracted. The SCF results
match with an analytical model based upon closed expressions for the
free energy change per diblock copolymer in the micelle. To gain insights
into the colloidal stability of dilute micelle suspensions, the second
virial coefficient normalized by the undistorted micelle volume (B2*) is evaluated. For stable micelles (B2* ≳ −6),
we find a weak dependence of B2* on solvophilic block length for
varying core-forming block properties (core solvation and block length).
The micelle suspension gets unstable (B2* ≲ −6)
when the corona-forming block crosses Θ-solvent conditions toward
poor solvency. In contrast with what is expected from models where
the soft nature of the micelle is not taken into account, increasing
the effective grafting density of solvophilic tails from the core
then leads to colloidal destabilization of the micelle suspension.

Introduction
The association of
polymers and surfactants (macromolecules) into
soft colloidal particles provides a playground for generating a wide
range of self-assembled architectures in selective solvents.1 Substantial attention has been paid to predetermine
the preferred morphology of association colloids.2 Among the possible micellar shapes, the spherical one is
appealing because of its wide applicability for instance in coatings,3 in food,4 and as drug
delivery system.5−8 In many applications, control is not only desired over the morphology
of the self-assembled structure but also over the thermodynamic stability
of the micellar suspension. A widely applied technique to enhance
the stability of inorganic colloidal particles is
grafting polymers onto their surface, which leads to steric stabilization.9,10 For spherical micelles formed by block copolymers, such steric stabilization
is inherent.11 Understanding how micelles
interact is key to envisage, and therefore predict, the stability
of a micellar suspension. Previously presented models for micelle–micelle
interactions account for the core as a hard surface onto which the
solvophilic components are tethered.12−14 Micelles are however
dynamic because the assembled molecules are in equilibrium with free
ones, so the core–corona interface is soft and dynamic.15−18 For micelles with large coronal domains, the interaction between
micelles mediated by overlap of coronas has been compared with that
of star-like polymers.19,20 It is noted, however, that star-like
polymers are not self-assembled structures,21 and such models hence neglect the presence of free diblock copolymer
in solution. In this paper, the interaction between diblock copolymer
spherical micelles is quantified, while accounting for their soft
polymeric and associative nature. When computing the micelle–micelle
interaction potential, we allow the aggregation number (the number
of polymers composing the micelle) to equilibrate with free polymer
in the bulk at each intermicelle separation (r) distance.
We account for intermicellar distances r ≥
2Rho, with Rho the hydrodynamic radius of an undistorted
micelle. Hence, we focus on dilute micelle suspensions rather than
on high-density solid phases of micelles19 or possible micelle morphology transformations above their overlap
concentration.22,23

An effective indicator
for the thermodynamic stability of a colloidal
suspension is the second osmotic virial coefficient B2.24,25 Experimentally measured B2 values for micelle suspensions are limited.26−30 The value of B2 can be used to specify
the (colloidal) stability of a suspension. For a collection of hard
spheres, B2* = B2/vc = 4,31 where vc is the volume of the colloidal particle considered.
If repulsive forces beyond the pure hard core excluded volume interaction
are present between the colloidal particles, B2* > 4. For monocomponent
systems of interacting spheres, the Vliegenthart–Lekkerkerker
criterium32 identifies the onset of colloidal
gas–liquid coexistence at B2* = B2/vc ≲ −6.33,34

Here, we present a bottom-up approach to study the stability
of
a (colloidal) suspension of spherical micelles formed by diblock copolymers.
We calculate the pair interaction potentials via self-consistent field
(SCF) calculations for block copolymers with different block length
and solubility. Results are compared with an alternative analytical
expression for the interaction potential based upon the thermodynamics
of micelle formation.35 Numerical SCF computations
and analytical results are in good agreement. Furthermore, we calculate
the normalized second virial coefficient, B2* = B2/vc, where vc is the volume of an isolated micelle, and evaluate its
dependency on block copolymer composition and solvency parameters
of the blocks.

Results and Discussion
First, we
evaluate the dependence of the equilibrium micelle properties
on the intermicelle distance. This yields pair potentials obtained
via different methods (explained in the Methods section), for which case-examples are presented. Subsequently, we
use these pair potentials to compute the second virial coefficients
mediated by the solvophilic block solubility and chain length. Finally,
the effect of the diblock copolymer composition and monomeric interaction
parameters on the colloidal stability is summarized into two comprehensible,
simple plots.

Equilibrium Properties of Micelles with Varying Intermicelle
Distance
We focus first on the changes of the micellar equilibrium
properties at different intermicelle separation distances (x). These micellar properties were studied using a lattice
with concentration gradients in one (spherical lattice) or two directions
(cylindrical lattice). In Figure 1, we present the grand potential (Ω) obtained
via Scheutjens–Fleer self-consistent, mean-field (SCF) computations
as a function of the aggregation number gp for different lattice sizes and types for micelles formed by diblock
copolymers B24A45 in a solvent W. The interaction
between blocks and of blocks with the solvent are specified via Flory–Huggins
interaction parameters, namely χBW = 2 and χAW = 0.4. The interaction parameter χAB =
1 is used in all our calculations. The grand-potential curves using
one or two directions for concentration gradients practically overlap
if the lattice dimensions are large enough; in such a case, the dilute
solution limit of individual micelles is reached. There are no appreciable
differences in the maximum free energy required to form a micelle
as micelles get closer (decreasing x). However, the
average equilibrium aggregation number of the micelle (which satisfies
Ω = 0 with ∂Ω/∂gp < 0) decreases when micelles are formed at small enough distances.
For all diblock sequences BmAn studied here, it was verified that the preferred
self-assembled structure is a spherical micelle. An analysis of the
preferred self-assembled morphology of similar block sequences has
been investigated via SCF computations and compared with experimental
results.36

Figure 1 Grand potential Ω as a function
of the aggregation number gp at two different
intermicelle distances r obtained using a spherical
lattice (solid and dashed curves).
Open circles correspond to the grand-potential curve considering a
single micelle in a cylindrical lattice, allowing to study spherical
micelles with concentration gradients in two directions. The micelle
considered is composed of B24A45 diblock copolymers
with χBW = 2, χAW = 0.4, and χAB = 1.

The corresponding equilibrium
concentration profiles are presented Figure 2. If the number of
lattice sites is sufficiently large, the micelle size and aggregation
numbers are independent of the lattice type considered (spherical
or cylindrical lattice). This can be appreciated by the projection
of the equilibrium sizes from the spherical lattice onto the cylindrical
one (left panel of the top row in Figure 2). All sizes are expressed in terms of lattice
units (l.u., see Methods). Note that the distance
between the centers of the micelles x is set by the
number of lattice sites. For one-gradient SCF computations, x = 2Nlat (with Nlat the number of concentration shells considered). For
two-gradient computations, x = 2Nlatr (if the
nearest micelles are in the radial direction) or x = Nlaty (in case the nearest micelles are in the longitudinal direction).
Further details are deferred to the Methods section. The hydrodynamic micelle radius (Rho) in the dilute
limit (x ≫ 2Rho) is Rho ≈
20 l.u. for the B24A45 block copolymer micelle
(details on the calculation of Rho deferred to the Supporting Information). From the concentration profiles,
the hydrodynamic size can be computed. The solvophobic blocks are
concentrated in the core of the spherical micelle, which is compact
and nearly solvent-free.37 The approximated
core size (Rc) is indicated via the orange
dashed vertical lines. The solvophilic blocks are mainly located in
the corona, which is well-solvated. For this case, the hydrodynamic
size (vertical purple dashed lines) matches with the situation at
which the total polymer volume fraction has roughly decayed to 10%.
It is noted that solvophilic polymer segments are also significantly
present at positions beyond Rho, see top panels of Figure 2. We denote the region where
solvophilic segments are clearly present (ϕ ≫ ϕbulk, with ϕbulk the polymer bulk concentration)
beyond Rho as the solvophilic tails part.
When micelles get close, the overlapping of these outer tail regions
leads to a contraction of the coronas already at intermicelle distances x > 2Rho. This induces a decrease in the micelle size
with respect to the dilute limit even at x > 2Rho (see Figure 3). The
interpenetration of these solvophilic tails is clearly visible in
the bottom right panels of Figure 2, where the density profiles from the two concentration
gradients computations in either the radial or the longitudinal length
is of the order of 2Rho.

Figure 2 Concentration profiles computed using
SCF theory in a spherical
lattice with concentration gradients in one dimension (left panels)
or in a cylindrical lattice with concentration gradients in two dimensions
(right panels) at equilibrium conditions (see Figure 1). Nearest-neighbor micelle distances x are indicated, as well as the number of lattice sites
(Nlat). Vertical lines correspond either
to the corresponding hydrodynamic sizes (orange and purple) or to
the mirror (blue, only in the bottom leftmost panel). Orange and purple
circles (right panels) correspond to the sizes on the left, while
clouds of purple points correspond to polymer concentrations in between
1 and 10%.

Figure 3 Characteristic size and effective change of
aggregation number
as a function of the normalized intermicelle distance x̃ = x/2Rho for the same system parameters as in Figure 1.

We use the micelle size in the dilute limit as
characteristic length
scale for the pair interaction between micelles. The variation of
the aggregation number as a function of the normalized intermicelle
distance x̃ = x/(2Rho) is shown in Figure 3. Because of the lattice-nature of the approach followed, it is useful
to compare the aggregation number change (Δg) normalized by the number of nearest neighboring micelles K when bringing the micelles closer to each other 1  

As micelles get closer (decreasing x), their sizes
decrease because of the overlap of the solvophilic tails, which leads
to contraction of the coronas. From the results in Figure 3, it follows that both the
characteristic size of the micelle core and corona as well as the
aggregation number decrease upon bringing micelles closer together.
The overall size decreases already for x ≲
3.2Rho: the outer solvophilic tails start to interact significantly
near x̃ ≈ 1.6. The onset of the decrease
of the core size and aggregation number appear simultaneously near x̃ ≈ 1.2. This may be explained by the strong
dependence of the aggregation number on the core and corona-forming
block size:35 for x̃ ≲ 1.2, the core is compressed due to the fact that diblock
copolymers start to dissociate from the micelle.

The decrease
of the aggregation number of the micelles as they
get closer (see Figure 3) contrasts with regular scaling models, where the aggregation number
is assumed to remain constant up to the limit where micelles overlap
and increases beyond overlap of the micelles.38 We note that the models presented here concern dilute suspensions
of micelles, as we do not study the micellar changes for r < 2Rho. Upon approaching overlap of micelles, a small
decrease of the aggregation number (of the order of what we find here)
has been found experimentally.38 The trend
shown in Figure 3 holds
when increasing the solvophilic block length (see the Supporting Information) but the variation in gp is smaller with increasing n at fixed x̃ (as micelles become more star-like).
It has been suggested that the increase of gp above overlap of the micelles is associated with a change
of the preferred micellar morphology far beyond micelle overlap concentration.22,23 The 2D-gradient SCF approach followed here might be able of capturing
such effects, which are out of the scope of the present study.

Model
Comparison and Lattice Geometry Effects
In this
section, the pair potentials obtained via the different theoretical
approaches and using different lattice types are compared. Again,
we consider diblock copolymers B24A45 with parameters
χBW = 2, χAW = 0.4, χAB = 1. The dependence of the micelle equilibrium with intermicelle
distance provide all required components for calculating the pair
interactions (see Methods), which are presented
in Figure 4. We consider
purely SCF lattice computations using one or two concentration gradients,
as well as an analytical approach (see Methods) in which the only input from the SCF computations is the change
in the aggregation number as a function of the intermicelle distance
(denoted as Hybrid). The different methods produce very similar results:
a strong, short-ranged repulsion takes place at short intermicelle
distances (x̃ ≲ 1.4) which originates
from the excluded volume repulsion of the solvophilic tails, corresponding
to the situation where coronas contract (see left panel of Figure 3). This repulsive
interaction is similar to a brush-like repulsion between polymer-grafted
colloids12,13,39 and star-like
polymers.40 For spherical micelles, however,
we find that the “surface” at which the “brushes”
(solvophilic tails) are grafted is soft, and the effective grafting
density is dynamic: both gp and Rh depend on the distance between the micelles.
SCF accounts for the soft and dynamic nature of the micelles.

Figure 4 Interaction

and the hybrid model (eq 8), where the values of gp are obtained
from SCF. Curves correspond to the hard-core-Yukawa (HCY) potential
fit while symbols are calculated points. Solid, black curve correspond
to the HCY fit of the one concentration gradient calculations. Dashed,
orange curve corresponds to the hybrid method. Dashed curves hold
for the two-gradient computations where micelles are brought closer
to each other in the radial or longitudinal direction.

In Figure 4, the
calculated interaction potential from SCF and the hybrid approach
are plotted. The interactions between two micelles using the different
approaches are quite close. It appeared to be convenient to fit the
interaction potential via a HCY interaction. This allows to systematically
quantify the range of repulsion (qY) between
micelles and how the interaction depends on the diblock copolymer
properties. Further, the HCY model has been proposed as a model potential
for the interaction between block copolymer micelles.41 The fitting results (details can be found in the Supporting Information) are presented in Table 1. The fitted HCY curves
can describe the SCF data points quite well, see Figure 4. Variations are expected in
the contact potential values for the different approaches due to the
steepness of the interactions calculated. The qY values obtained do however not vary significantly. The small
differences can be related to slightly different Δgp(x) values, see Figure 3. Our bottom-up approach differs from the
ones previously reported in literature, where the mapping of the micelle–micelle
repulsion into a HCY41 or pure hard sphere42 pair potential was performed using a top-down
approach, via fitting experimentally collected structure factors with
theoretical ones.

a Diblock copolymer characteristics:
B24A45, χBW = 2, χAW = 0.4, and χAB = 1.

To gain more insights into the colloidal
stability of micelle suspensions,
we also compare the obtained normalized second virial coefficient B2* = B2/vc,
where the effective colloidal particle volume vc is taken as the hydrodynamic volume of a micelle in the dilute
solution limit 2  

We summarized the
results for the potentials and B2* in Figure 4 in Table 1. Details on the calculation
of B2* from the pair interaction can be found in the Supporting Information. The slight decrease of B2* with decreasing the number of nearest-neighbor micelles K points toward a small overestimation of the contact potential
values when calculations on the spherical lattice are conducted, most
likely because of the different core compressions induced. Deviations
of the results depending on the number of concentration gradients
using SCF computations are expected.13,43 However, SCF
calculations in the spherical lattice are sufficiently accurate to
resolve the main characteristics of diblock copolymer micelle–micelle
interactions.

Coronal Solvency Effects
Next, we
discuss the effects
of the solvophilic block solvency parameter (χAW)
on the intermicellar interactions of the same block copolymer type
as before (B24A45 with χBW =
2 and varying χAW). This solvency parameter governs
the colloidal stability of the micellar suspension (as shown in the
next section). We consider SCF computations with concentration gradients
in one direction. In Figure 5, results are shown for the pair interaction for several χAW values. The black curve corresponds to χAW = 0.4, the reference situation reported already in the previous
section. For χAW < 0.4, the repulsions get more
long-ranged which increases B2* (see also Table 2). By increasing the solvent quality for
the corona-forming blocks, the tails extend further from Rho. This leads
to a longer-ranged repulsion. The opposite trend is observed for χAW > 0.4. Strikingly, a shallow attraction between the micelles
around x = 1.2 appears for χAW =
0.5. At the Θ-solvent conditions, the excluded volume between
corona-forming segments is exactly compensated by the attraction among
them. When the corona blocks start to overlap, these attractions become
increasingly important as there are less corona–solvent contacts.
This explains, we think, the attractive part of the potential for
χAW = 0.5. The repulsion contribution at Θ-solvent
conditions arises from compression of the core. Upon further increase,
χAW the attractive part of the potential would increase.

parameters of the corona-forming block. Diblock copoylmer considered
is B24A45, χBW = 2, χAB = 1, and varying χAW as indicated. Curves
correspond to the HCY potential fit while symbols are extracted from
SCF data. For χAW = 0.5, the calculated points are
simply joined as a HCY fit is not applicable in this case.

0.2	0.16	11.8	0.16	11.9	
0.1	0.17	12.3	0.17	12.4	
In Table 2, we present
the obtained range of repulsion (when possible) as well as the normalized
second virial coefficient for the potentials in Figure 5. With increasing χAW, the qY values get smaller and B2* decreases. Near
χAW ≈ 0.5, the colloidal stability of the
micelle suspension drops strongly. The pair interactions (hence their
fitting parameters) do not significantly vary with the method (hybrid
method or pure SCF) used in their calculation.

Solvophilic Block Length
Effects
In this section, we
address the effect of varying the solvophilic block length, which
leads to an increase of the coronal thickness. The effect of increasing
the coronal thickness is twofold. On the one hand, because of a soft
decay of the coronal domain (concentration profiles in the Supporting Information), the steric repulsion
gets more long-ranged (reflected in a larger qY value, see Table 3). On the other hand, the aggregation number decreases whilst
increasing the hydrodynamic size because of an increased overall diblock
solvency (see the Supporting Information for details on the dependence of gp with
diblock properties). Thus, the effective grafting density of solvophilic
tails from the core (see next section) decreases with increasing n. As observed in the previous section, the strongest contribution
to the steric repulsion between micelles arises, within our model,
from compression of the core. Thus, there is a balance between the
range and the strength of the steric repulsion because of the coronal
decays with increasing the solvophilic block length, which leads to
an overall high B2* value, which weakly depends on the particular n-value. When increasing n, the decrease
of gp weakens (see the Supporting Information): the core compression gets more screened
upon increasing the corona thickness.

In Figure 6, examples
of pair potentials for various n-values (B24An with χBW = 2, χAW = 0.4, and χAB = 1; black curve corresponds
to the chosen reference diblock) are plotted. The shape of the interaction
potentials resemble those presented in Figure 4. As can be appreciated, the HCY potential
fits even better for larger n-values: the interaction
between diblock copolymeric micelles (particularly, with long hydrophilic
tails) is similar to the outer-soft-core contribution of the interaction
between star-like polymers.19,21 In Table 3, the resulting HCY-fitted interaction
range, contact potential, and normalized second virial coefficient
are listed for various hydrophilic block lengths n. For the conditions investigated, B2* still remains
approximately constant (though a slight decrease is appreciated when
considering very large coronal domains).

block lengths n as indicated. The diblock copolymer
considered is B24An, χBW = 2, χAB = 1, and χAW =
0.4. Solid curves correspond to the HCY potential fit of the SCF data,
whilst dashed curves correspond to fittings of the hybrid approach
presented.

On the Colloidal Stability
of Spherical Micelles
In
this section, a colloidal stability overview of diblock copolymer
micelle suspensions is presented in terms of the calculated second
virial coefficient. This quantity can be related to the colloidal
stability and can be experimentally measured using light-scattering
techniques. The interaction between polymer brushes anchored to solid
surfaces (steric stabilization) sensitively depends on the grafting
density of polymers.12,44,45 To compare the interactions between colloidal spheres with anchored
polymeric brushes and those between spherical copolymer micelles,
we considered an effective grafting density of solvophilic blocks
at the core–corona interface 3  where Rc is the
core size, estimated from the SCF concentration profiles. The absolute
value of Γc for diblock copolymer micelles depends
on the considered system parameters: the number of lyophobic block
segments (m), the number of lyophilic block segments
(n), and their solvency parameters (χBW and χAW). However, in terms of the colloidal stability,
the solvency and length of the core-forming blocks (m and χBW) does hardly affect B2* (as shown in the
left panel of Figure 7) for the spherical micelles studied. This is due to a balance between
the range (increasing with n) and the strength (decreasing
with n) of the steric repulsion (details in the Supporting Information). In fact, a value of B2* ≈ 9 ± 1 is found independent of {m, n, χBW} for a fixed coronal block solvency
of χAW = 0.4 (see Figure 7). Hence, the grafting density at the core–corona
interface hardly mediates repulsive micelle–micelle interactions.
This is in contrast with the expectations for the interaction between
hard spheres with anchored brushes. Next, we focus again on the influence
of the interaction between the solvophilic tails as mediated by χAW.

Figure 7 Left panel: Normalized second virial coefficient B2* of spherical
micelles composed of diblock copolymers B24An with increasing solvophilic block length n. Right panel: B2* for the same data sets as on the left
panel but in terms of the grafting density of solvophilic segments
from the core Γc.

The influence of the corona block solvency (χAW) on B2* is plotted in Figure 8. For χAW ≤ 0.45, we find B2* > 4 for all values of n, indicating that micelles
with these characteristics always interact in an overall (highly)
repulsive fashion. The value of χAW does not only
affect the grafting density but also the interaction between the coronal
tails. Upon approaching Θ-solvent conditions (χAW → 0.5), the mutual excluded volume repulsion
decreases. Thus, and contrary to what is expected from sterically
stabilized inorganic colloids,12,44B2*decreases because of solvophobic effects
with increasing the (diblock properties dependent) grafting density.

Figure 8 Left panel:

lengths n. Right panel: B2* for the same data
sets as on the left but in terms of the grafting density of solvophilic
segments at the core–corona interface.

The attractive part of the pair interaction may be deep enough
to destabilize the micelle suspension (Figure 5), as seen in Figure 8 (left panel) for χAW ≳
0.5. In contrast with theoretical predictions for polymer-grafted
colloids,12,44 this colloidal destabilization arises (within
our model) without considered direct attractions between micelles.
Colloidal destabilization around Θ-solvent conditions for the
corona arises because of solvophobic effects: the enthalpic gain due
to the solvent expel as micelles get closer is sufficient to compensate
the entropic penalty of compressing the solvophilic tails.

Conclusions
In this paper, the interaction between dilute (diblock) copolymer
micelles is quantified using numerical SCF computations and analytical
theory. We use the aggregation number obtained from the SCF computations
as an input for the analytical theory. The intermicelle pair-potentials
obtained via the two methods are in good agreement, also when considering
different lattice topologies. Particularly, the range of the interaction
and the normalized second virial coefficient are all rather similar:
they are not sensitive to the method used and to how many concentration
gradients are considered. In our approach, we account for the soft
and dynamic nature of these association colloids as the micelles get
closer. At each condition, the equilibrium micellization is re-evaluated:
all polymer blocks in the micelles remain associative and fully responsive
and can conformationally rearrange and equilibrate at each condition.
For coronal domains whose solvency is better than Θ-solvent
conditions, this results in a HCY-like repulsion for all cases studied.
The range of this repulsion depends on the solvophilic block length,
whereas its strength decreases with increasing solvophilic block chain
because of a decrease of their effective grafting density, which leads
to a weak dependence of the second virial coefficient on solvophilic
block length.

We find that the colloidal stability of a dilute
diblock copolymer
micelle suspension is only weakly affected by the nature of the core
(solvophobicity and chain length of the core blocks). Not surprisingly,
colloidal suspensions of diblock copolymer micelles are always stable
(normalized second virial coefficient B2* > −6)
unless
the solvophilic blocks are near Θ-solvent or in poor solvent
conditions. For fixed core-forming block properties but different
solvophilic block length, the normalized second virial coefficients
with varying coronal block solvency follow a similar curve. Furthermore,
and contrary to what is expected from polymer-grafted colloidal particles,
increasing the effective grafting density of solvophilic blocks from
the micelle core decreases the colloidal stability
of the micellar suspension. This is explained because of the interplay
between Γc and the properties of the solvophilic
and solvophobic blocks. The SCF method presented here for intermicelle
interactions can be extended to account for more components in solution
and other block sequences.

In this section, we summarize
the theoretical and numerical methods
used to study the diblock copolymer micelles.

SCF for Micelle–Micelle
Interactions
We used
the Scheutjens–Fleer self-consistent lattice theory (SCF)46,47 to perform numerical calculations. It is based upon Flory–Huggins
mean-field theory,48 but with concentration
gradients following discrete versions of the Edwards equation accounting
for the mean-field polymer propagation.49 The interdependence of the segment potentials (uk) and the volume fractions (ϕk) for each component in the system  is the core idea
of the self-consistent method.50 Provided
a user-defined starting configuration
for the components in the lattice, the free energy of the lattice
is minimized in a self-consistent fashion. The boundary conditions
and the lattice geometry need to be specified. We consider here two
different lattice types, namely, a spherical lattice with concentration
gradients in one direction and a cylindrical lattice with concentration
gradients in two directions. Mirror boundary conditions are set for
all boundaries.51 A spherical lattice is
defined as shells from the center (r = 0) of the
lattice up to r = Nlat. The first lattice layer corresponds to the center of the spherical
micelle. As we focus on conditions where a spherical micelle is preferred
over other self-assembled structures, a spherical lattice is used
in most of our calculations. A cylindrical lattice is defined by a
grid of Nlatr sites in the radial coordinate and Nlaty sites in the longitudinal coordinate, and we use it here simply
to asses the validity of the calculation of the pair potential using
the spherical lattice.

Because of the mirror conditions imposed,
a micelle is formed in the presence of K surrounding
ones. The distance between the centers of two nearest-neighbor micelles x defines the characteristic length scale involved in the
pair potential calculation. For the spherical lattice, K = 12 and x = 2Nlat.
For the cylindrical one, six cylindrical lattices are present around
the simulated one in the radial direction (Kr = 6) while two span from the top and bottom of the radial
mirror conditions [one from the upper and one from the lower boundaries
of the lattice, (Ky = 2)]. In this case,
the pair-potential calculation depends on how Nlat(k) is varied
(k = {r, y}). In the cylindrical lattice, micelles are formed in the
center of the radial axis of symmetry (see Figure 2). This implies that the nearest neighbors
are at distances xr = 2Nlatr (radial
direction) and xy = Nlaty (longitudinal
direction).

The SCF approach is combined with small system thermodynamics52 to study the conditions under which the diblock
copolymers form self-assembled morphologies.53 To find the equilibrium configuration, we compute the grand potential
Ω of the system for a specific diblock copolymer as a function
of the aggregation number gp. This grand
potential relates to the inhomogeneities in the system: in a pure
solvent Ω = 0. As diblock copolymers are added to the solution,
Ω increases because of the contacts present between solution
and solvophobic blocks. The appearance of the first thermodynamically
stable micelle is marked by a maximum in Ω. If a micelle can
form Ω decreases with gp, and at
a given diblock concentration the condition Ωg≠0 = 0 is met (with ∂Ω/∂gp < 0). At this condition, the block copolymers
in the micelle are in equilibrium with free block copolymers in the
bulk: the chemical potential of one copolymer in the micelle is equal
to that in the bulk 4  with ϕpbulk being the bulk polymer segment volume fraction.
Once an equilibrium micelle is found, we characterize its size by
calculating the hydrodynamic radius54 (see
the Supporting Information). The work required
to dissociate all polymers from the fully grown self-assembled structure
(equivalently, the energy gain of the diblocks upon micellization)
at a certain intermicelle distance x follows as55 5  where gs is the
excess number of solvent monomers (provided by SCF). The chemical
potential for the solvent is evaluated at the micelle equilibrium
condition via 6  with ϕsbulk the bulk concentration of solvent. Even
at small intermicelle distances x, there is always
a high volume fraction of solvent in the bulk as considered in SCF.
Hence, ln ϕsbulk ≈ 0, and w(x)
is dominated by the changes in the diblock copolymer as expected (see
the Supporting Information). These SCF-provided
equilibrium quantities enable us to estimate the pair interaction
potential between micelles as 7  

Thus, the equilibrium
properties computed from SCF provide a route
for calculating the pair potentials considering a micelle composed
of gp polymers surrounded by K other micelles at a distance x. Our approach does
not imply any ad hoc interaction between the coronas. We extract pair
interactions between the micelles, which originate naturally from
the equilibrium properties of micelles formed at a given x. For small enough x, the coronas start to overlap
(see Figure 2), affecting
the equilibrium micelle formation conditions and hence the free energy
of micelle formation.

Analytical Expression for the Interaction
Potential
An analytical expression for the interaction potential
can be obtained
from previously developed theories for block copolymer micelles. The
presence of the K surrounding micelles exerts an
isotropic compression on the central micelle for values of r smaller than, say, the micelle’s undistorted (dilute
limit) diameter 2Rho. The confined micelle is assumed to be in
equilibrium with free copolymer molecules, which enables to minimize
the unfavorable increase of the free energy upon compression; the
aggregation number gp is allowed to vary
with x. The pair interaction potential W(x) can be expressed as 8  where fmic(x) is the free energy of a micelle whose center is separated
by a distance x from a neighboring one. Hence, fmic(x = ∞) is the free
energy of an isolated micelle. The free energy of a micelle can be
approximated as the sum of three contributions: the elastic free energy
of the core-forming blocks, the elastic free energy of the corona-forming
blocks, and the interfacial energy between the core and the solvent
at the core–corona interface. We use an approximate expression
for  by
modifying a result from Zhulina and
Borisov35 9  Here, l is the size of a
monomer, Rc(x) and T(x) represent the core radius and the
corona thickness, respectively, RB is
the radius of the collapsed B block in an unassembled block copolymer
molecule, and γ is the interfacial tension between the core
and the solvent. The value of γ is calculated approximately
from the Helfand–Tagami equation56 10  

Both Rc(x) and T(x) can
be expressed as a function of gp(x) (see the Supporting Information). Hence, given the χ-parameters and the block copolymer composition,
we only need gp(x) to
calculate W(x). Hence, the results
of this analytical theory are denoted as hybrid because SCF input
is needed (only through gp(x)).

System Parameters
Below, the set of system parameters
are specified. In general, we use the notation BmAn to denote the diblock whose
solvophobic block (B) is composed of m segments and
whose solvophilic block (A) is composed of n segments.
Next, we specify the interaction of the solvophobic segments χBW, the solvophilic segments χAW, and the
interaction between segments of different nature χAB. The set of Flory–Huggins interaction parameters is based upon previous investigations on
diblock copolymer systems in water (Table 4).36

We note that even though multiple
systematic variations have been
conducted, we report only the main results that allowed us to determine
how the stability of micelles decreases with effective grafting density
of solvophilic chains from the core. Further results of the systematic
parameter scan conducted are deferred to the Supporting Information.
