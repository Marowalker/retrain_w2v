Antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) are promising candidates for surface
coatings to control biofilm growth on water treatment membranes because
of their broad activity and the low tendency of bacteria to develop
resistance to AMPs. However, general and convenient surface modification
methods are limited, and a deeper understanding of the antimicrobial
mechanism of action is needed for surface-attached AMPs. Here, we
show a method for covalently attaching AMPs on porous ultrafiltration
membranes using ink-jet printing and provide insight into the mode
of action for the covalently tethered peptide RWRWRWA-(Bpa) (Bpa,
4-benzophenylalanine) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AMP-coated ultrafiltration membranes showed surface antibacterial
activity and reduced biofilm growth. Fluorescence microscopy analysis
revealed that the modified surfaces could cause cell membrane disruption,
which was seen by live uptake of propidium iodide stain, and scanning
electron microscopy images showed compromised cell membranes of attached
bacteria. This study indicated that the mode of action of covalently
tethered AMPs was similar to that of freely soluble AMPs. The deeper
understanding of the mode of action of AMPs covalently attached to
surfaces could lead to a more rational approach for designing surfaces
with antibacterial activity.

1 Introduction
Membrane
fouling is a major problem encountered in membrane filtration
processes especially in applications such as wastewater treatment
and desalination. Fouling in the pressure-driven membrane technology
leads to increased economic and environmental costs because water
permeation is reduced and chemicals are used to clean the surfaces.
The use of chemicals not only reduces the membrane lifespan but also
the chemicals used are ultimately released into the environment. Among
various types of membrane fouling, biofouling (or microbial/biological
fouling) is one of the major problems faced by the water treatment
industries. Biofouling refers to any undesirable accumulation of living
organisms on a surface causing a decrease in permeate production in
a membrane filtration system.1,2 Biofouling was termed
the “Achilles heel” of membrane-based water technologies3 because even if 99.9% of microorganisms are removed,
the small number of remaining cells can multiply by colonizing on
the surfaces and can grow by utilizing bioorganic substances in the
feed water. Biofouling contributes to more than 45% of all membrane
fouling,4,5 and it is an inherent problem in reverse
osmosis (RO), ultrafiltration (UF), and nanofiltration membrane filtration
processes. An attractive strategy to delay biofilm formation is the
fabrication of membrane surfaces with antibacterial properties, which
might hinder the biofouling process. Inhibition of bacterial growth
on the membrane surfaces might lead to effective separation processes
and improved membrane performance.6 UF
membranes with antibacterial and antifouling properties might be advantageous
because of their widespread use in food filtration processes and drinking
water treatment.

UF membranes are widely used in industry and
in a broad range of
applications. More specifically, polyethersulfone (PES) membranes
are extensively used in biomedical applications, water treatment,
and other industrial fields. Various strategies have been explored
to prevent or control biofilm growth on various surfaces, such as
surface grafting of zwitterion or polymer brushes, antibiotic surface
coatings, and the fabrication of new antifouling materials.7−15 Antibiotic coatings such as silver are very effective at prevention
of viable bacteria to proliferate on the surface; however, leaching
of the silver ions into the solution leads to limited lifespan of
the coating. A strategy that incorporates the antibacterial property
into the material itself is the covalent attachment of antimicrobials
such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to the surface, which could
mitigate the need to periodically re-apply the coating.16 However, the retention of antimicrobial activity
of immobilized AMPs is critical, and studies have showed that the
antimicrobial activity of bound AMPs is generally found to be less
compared to their soluble counterparts.17,18 Thus, the
fundamental understanding of antimicrobial activity of immobilized
peptides is essential for developing efficient and long-lasting antimicrobial
surfaces.

AMPs are peptides with broad spectrum activity that
target microorganisms
ranging from viruses to parasites.19,20 Natural AMPs
can be found in both eukaryotes (e.g., protozoan, fungi, plants, insects,
and animals) and prokaryotes (e.g., bacteria).21,22 In animals, AMPs are believed to be the first line of the innate
immune defense23−25 against fungi, viruses, and bacteria. For example,
magainin is secreted from frog skin and thus is effective to prevent
colonization of microorganisms on the skin’s surface26 and indicates that topical applications are
suitable for such AMPs. Natural AMPs can be unsuitable for large-scale
manufacturing because of the complexity or peptide length, which significantly
increases the costs. Alternatively, short artificial AMPs have been
proposed, and surprisingly short peptides have been shown to be very
effective antimicrobial agents, for example, the RWRWRW sequence27 and other designed lipopeptides that consist
of even fewer amino acid residues but conjugated to hydrophobic compounds.28 Despite the promising potential of these AMPs,
there is limited information regarding surface immobilized AMPs and
further investigation is needed.

Recently, the mode of action
of the RWRWRW peptide and other related
sequences was extensively studied and reported.29,30 This peptide sequence was shown to target the lipid membrane, having
no specific receptor–ligand interaction, but having the ability
to interfere with multiple cellular processes. The cationic nature
of the arginine residue and the interactions of the tryptophan residues
with lipid membrane components can uniquely combine to associate with
bacterial lipid membranes.31 Similar artificial
AMPs attached to surfaces might be valuable for suppression of bacterial
growth because they would still be able to interact with bacterial
membranes in multiple ways.32 In order
to investigate the antibacterial mode of action of immobilized AMPs,
we attached the similar, yet augmented sequence RWRWRWA-Bpa [Bpa,
3-(4-benzoylphenyl)alanine] on the PES membrane by a UV ink-jet printing-assisted
modification method. Benzophenone is a photoreactive compound that
has been shown to react covalently with compounds at close proximity
using ∼365 nm ultraviolet irradiation.33,34 Incorporation of benzophenone in the peptide sequence and application
on the surface with printing and direct UV irradiation can lead to
a covalent attachment of the peptide onto surfaces. In our previous
study, we used the same peptide sequence RWRWRWA-Bpa for modification
of the surface of a RO membrane.35 The
peptide was concentrated on the surface by filtration after which
UV irradiation covalently attached the peptide to the membrane. In
the present study, the ink-jet printer was used to both apply the
peptide on the surface and activate with UV. This new method increases
the versatility of the coating process because porous surfaces such
as UF membranes can now be modified in a process that combines the
coating and UV activation in one step. Printing could also improve
the precision of the process and reduce the consumption of chemicals
and moreover opens new possibilities for modification such as patterned
membrane surfaces.36,37

2 Results
and Discussion
A new method for immobilization of AMPs on
UF membranes was developed
using an ink-jet printer with a UV light fixed to the print head,
which applied the photoreactive peptide solution to the surface followed
with immediate UV irradiation. In this way, multiple coatings can
be printed in order to increase the peptide amount on the surface.
To estimate the amount of peptide printed on the surfaces, we theoretically
calculated and experimentally measured the volume of peptide solution
printed on the membrane. Using the ink concentration of 3.33 mg/mL,
the theoretical value of peptide printed on the membrane was 3.72
μg/cm2 (37.2 mg/m2). This was compared
to experimentally weighing the ink that was printed on a membrane,
which gave a peptide amount of 20 ± 2 mg/m2. However,
because such small volumes were printed, significant evaporation could
have occurred in the time from printing to weighing the sample. Thus,
the actual amount of printed peptide was probably between the measured
and theoretical values.

2.1 Membrane Surface Characterization
UF membranes were printed using the UV-printing method (see Materials and Methods) with 0, 1, 2, or 4 layers
of peptide ink and compared with membranes printed with ink only.
Each sample was subjected to intense washing with sonication in order
to ensure that only covalently bound RWRWRWA-(Bpa) remained on the
membrane coupons. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characterization
showed a new signal at 1660 cm–1, which was probably
due to the amide bonds of the attached peptide (Figure 1a).38 This signal
was correlated with the amount of peptide printed, and as the number
of printed layers on UF membranes increased, the signal also increased.
This absorption signal was normalized to the PES membrane material
using the ratio between the amide peak intensity and the membrane
peak at 1487 cm–1,39 and
this peak ratio corresponded to the peptide degree of grafting (Figure 1b). Comparably, the
peak ratios from the membranes printed with only the base ink were
always less than the peptide printed membranes and did not show an
increasing trend. This method is different than modification of UF
membranes by photoassisted graft polymerization via direct UV excitation
of the polymer, which employs acrylic monomers:40 In the present method, the photoreactive amino acid 3-(4-benzoyl)phenylalanine41 was incorporated into the peptide and is used
to link the peptide covalently to the surface.

membranes printed with RWRWRWA-(Bpa) by
1, 2, and 4 peptide printing layers; (b) peak ratios (1660–1487
cm–1) between UF membranes printed with RWRWRWA-(Bpa)
(□), and C6A base ink only (○); (c) Ponceau S staining
results of untreated, base ink printed and 1× peptide printed
UF membranes; (d) XPS deconvolution of N 1s from the peptide-modified
(1× print) and unmodified membranes; and (e) static CA measurements
from UF membranes printed with multiple layers of RWRWRWA-(Bpa) comparing
to untreated membranes and membranes printed with base ink (4×)
(*P = 0.041, **P = 0.0004).

In order to verify that the peptide
was indeed attached to the
surface, visualization was done with the Ponceau S staining method,
which can detect micrograms of peptide and shows a reddish-pink color
when attached to the peptides. Ponceau S is a negatively charged dye
and can bind to the positively charged amine and guanidine groups
in the peptides. We observed that the areas of the membrane that underwent
peptide modification were stained pink, whereas the unmodified membrane
did not change color (Figure 1c). Next, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed,
which also revealed the presence of the peptide. The atomic percentage
of N 1s increased significantly from 1 to 5.6% after attachment of
RWRWRWA-(Bpa) on the PES membrane support (Figure 1d). Deconvolution of the N 1s peak at 400.5
eV showed specifically that the N–H bond from indole42 and N–H from amide bonds were present
and corresponded to the bound peptide sequence, which contained tryptophan
(3 of 8 residues). Taken together, this evidence indicated that the
UV ink-jet printing modification was successful.

The hydrophilicity
of the membrane surface was moderately increased
as more peptide was attached as seen from a decreasing water contact
angle (CA) (Figure 1e). The CA decreased from 87° ± 2.1 for the untreated membrane
to 76° ± 2.8 for the membrane printed with four layers of
peptide. For the membrane that was printed only with the ink, a minor
decrease was observed (83° ± 0.7) and might have been due
to the adsorption of the base ink components to the surface or slight
degradation of the PES due to the UV treatment.43 Although the difference between the peptide printed membranes
was very minor, the differences between 1 and 2 prints or 1 and 4
prints were significant (P = 0.041 and 0.004, respectively).
The peptide printing modification also affected the pure water permeability.
After peptide modification, the membrane permeability decreased from
691 ± 76 LMH/bar for the control membrane to 360 ± 69 LMH/bar
for the membrane printed with four layers of peptides and corresponded
to a 48% flux reduction (Figure 2). A possible reason for such a decrease could be the
immobilization of peptide inside the small pores at the membrane surface,
which could have reduced the average pore size in the barrier layer.
Compared to an unmodified membrane, the energy requirement for filtration
processes utilizing the modified membrane would be thus higher due
to elevated pressures needed for the same water production. However,
the resistance to membrane biofouling might lead to less frequent
cleaning procedures and longer lasting membranes, which might mitigate
the extra energy costs.

layers of RWRWRWA-(Bpa).

2.2 Bacterial Inhibition on the Surfaces
It has been previously demonstrated by us and by others that peptides
can kill bacteria while attached to surfaces,35,38,44,45 but less is
known about the mode of action of tethered antimicrobial compounds.
Thus, in order to confirm that these surfaces were antimicrobial,
we performed a bacterial inhibition assay where the viability of a
culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was
measured after being contacted with the surface. A low-to-moderate
killing effect was observed, and a maximum inhibition of 36% was seen
on the peptide printed membrane (four layers of printed peptide).
The inhibition decreased as peptide amount decreased (Figure 3a). The samples were also visualized
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for a qualitative analysis
of bacterial appearance (Figure 3b,c). In general, bacteria in contact with the UF membranes
without AMPs showed smooth surfaces and uniform shape and appearance
(Figure 3b). However,
the appearance of bacteria after contact with the membranes containing
tethered AMPs indicated stress, including structural damage (Figure 3c). Previous research
showed that the peptide RWRWRW interacted with the cell membrane causing
disruptions in many cell processes including, for example, delocalization
of essential peripheral membrane proteins.29 Our present observations indicate that the attachment of the similar
peptide sequence RWRWRWA-(Bpa) on the surfaces of UF membranes can
also cause disruption of the bacterial membrane and ultimately lead
to an inhibitory effect, although disruptions in specific cellular
processes were not studied.

UF membrane surfaces modified with RWRWRWA-(Bpa) peptides. (b) SEM
image of P. aeruginosa on the surface
of an unmodified UF membrane and (c) peptide-modified UF membrane.
Red arrows indicate examples of bacteria with disrupted membranes
or inconsistent shape.

Similarly, bacteria that were contacted with the membrane
surfaces
were visualized using fluorescence microscopy. SYTO 9 and propidium
iodide were used to assess the viability of the cells. The dye SYTO
9 stains cells with intact cell membranes, whereas the bacteria with
disrupted or damaged cell membranes are stained with propidium iodide. P. aeruginosa that was contacted to the membranes
for 20 min was stained and transferred to a microscope slide and observed
for 15 min (see Figure 4 and videos in the Supporting Information). Throughout the visualization period, the bacteria remained green
and indicated that the bacteria were not adversely affected by contacting
the unmodified membrane (Figure 4a,b). In contrast, part of the bacteria population
that were contacted with the peptide-coated membranes changed from
green to red and indicated that the membranes became permeable to
propidium iodide, which indicated membrane damage (Figure 4c,d). Bacteria samples that
were treated with the free peptide in solution showed that the entire
population of cells became permeabilized (Figure 4e,f). The similar action between the free
peptide in solution and the tethered peptide on the surface indicated
that the mode of action on the bacterial membrane is most likely the
same. Because the peptide is covalently attached to the surface, the
surface bound peptides are limited to interaction with the bacterial
membrane and the relatively quick killing might indicate a detergent-like
action.

Figure 4 P. aeruginosa cells are contacted
with the peptide-modified and unmodified membranes for 20 min and
then stained and visualized using fluorescence microscopy. The cells
were monitored over a period of 15 min. Green color indicates live
cells with intact cell membranes, and red color indicates cells with
a compromised membrane. Bacteria contacted to unmodified membrane
surface at (a) start and (b) end of fluorescence visualization. Bacteria
contacted to a 1× print peptide-modified membrane surface at
(c) start and (d) end of fluorescence visualization. White arrows
indicate examples of bacteria that are permeabilized. Bacterial cells
were treated with free soluble RWRWRWA-(Bpa) at (e) start and (f)
end of fluorescence visualization.

2.3 Antibiofilm Activity
Antibacterial
surfaces might lead to surfaces that delay biofilm growth because
bacterial attachment is one of the first steps in biofilm development.
Thus, we subjected the peptide-modified membrane surface to biofilm
growth conditions in a flow cell experiment. The unmodified and modified
surfaces were inoculated with P. aeruginosa and kept in a constant nutrient media flow for 96 hours to grow
biofilm. Subsequently, confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) was
used to quantify the biofilm. The peptide-modified membranes indeed
showed a delayed biofilm growth, with a 66% reduction of biovolume
and 32% reduction of average thickness after 96 h against P. aeruginosa when compared to the control-unmodified
membranes (Figure 5). In addition to the antimicrobial surface effect, the slightly
increased hydrophilicity might have also contributed to delayed biofilm
development.

Figure 5 PES UF membranes [unmodified and printed with RWRWRWA-(Bpa)]
were
subjected to P. aeruginosa under biofilm
growth conditions for 96 h at a cross-flow velocity of 0.44 cm/min.
The biovolume and average thickness of biofilm were quantified using
CLSM, and the images below were simulated by Imaris software as the
representative images of each sample (green: live cells, red: dead
cells). *P = 0.022.

3 Conclusions
A general membrane surface
modification method was developed which
utilized an inkjet printer fitted with a UV lamp, which allowed both
photoreactive peptide deposition and immobilization on UF membranes.
The modified surfaces showed antibacterial activity and delayed biofilm
formation and appeared to maintain a membranolytic or detergent-like
mode of action, which was limited to the bacterial membrane. This
method could be applied for many purposes to a variety of polymer
surfaces for surface functionalization with compounds that contain
photoreactive linkers. To our knowledge, biofouling remains a significant
challenge in membrane technologies and the concepts presented here
to reduce biofilm growth and bacterial viability on surfaces can guide
future research in developing alternative solutions to be used in
reducing biofouling on UF membranes.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
The UF membrane (PES, MWCO
50 kDa) was purchased from MICRODYN-NADIR, Wiesbaden, Germany. RWRWRWA-(Bpa)
with a purity of 96% was purchased from ProteoGenix (Schiltigheim,
France). C6A base ink solution (35% glycerol, ∼3% propylene
glycol, and ∼1% Triton X-100) was obtained from www.inksupply.com (MIS Associates,
Inc., Pontiac, MI, USA). The P. aeruginosa PAO1 culture was used as a test organism. LIVE/DEAD BacLight and
Sytox green were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham,
MA, USA). Osmium tetraoxide and glutaraldehyde were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, Israel. The Luria–Bertani (LB) medium was purchased
from Bio-Lab Ltd., Israel.

4.2 Membrane Modification with
AMPs Using Ink-Jet
Printing
The Fujifilm Dimatix Material Printer (DMP-2800
series) was the ink-jet printer used and included a UV light-emitting
diode (LED) (a wavelength of ∼365 nm, OmniCure LX500). The
UV LED was purchased from Excelitas Canada Inc. and was fit onto the
print head.

4.2.1 UV Printing Method
The UF membranes
were first rinsed with 50% (vol) ethanol and then washed in a sonicator
with DDW (10 min × 3 times). They were then stored in DDW at
4 °C until used. Solutions of the benzophenyl-AMPs [RWRWRWA-(Bpa)]
were made by dissolving 10 mg in 3 mL of C6A base ink. These solutions
were passed through a 0.22 μm syringe filter to prevent any
particles from clogging the cartridge or inner tubes or the ejecting
nozzles, and added to the printer cartridge (10 pL drop volume). The
printer cartridge volume was 3 mL. All printer nozzles (16) were open
and printer settings were adjusted to obtain an even jetting velocity
of 7–9 m/s. If multiple prints were performed, the time between
prints was set to 5 min. The platen temperature was set to 50 °C.
Then, the UV lamp was attached to the print head and turned on, and
the ink solution was printed using the setting of 30 μm drop
spacing (DS) on a 40 mm × 40 mm square UF membrane. Afterward,
the modified UF membranes were washed in DDW using sonication (3 ×
10 min in an ice bath), dried, and were characterized and tested with
FTIR and XPS, and the surface CA was measured. Average results including
standard deviation are reported.

4.2.2 Theoretical
Ink Volume Calculation
A 10 × 10 mm square membrane
was jetted with 111 556
drops of ink solution (DS: 30 μm, 1 layer), and the total theoretical
volume was calculated by multiplying 10 pL/drop as specified by the
manufacturer rating of the cartridge.

4.2.3 Experimental
Ink Volume Measurement
Three membranes (10 × 10 mm)
were weighed and subsequently printed
with 111 556 drops of ink solution (DS: 30 μm, 1 layer).
The membranes were immediately weighed after printing was complete.
The quantity of solution deposited on the surface obtained by the
averaged weight difference, and the density of the peptide-ink solution
was used to calculate the volume, which together with the peptide
concentration could estimate the printed peptide amount.

4.3 Membrane Characterization
4.3.1 Attenuated
Total Reflection Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy
The membrane samples were characterized
by a VERTEX 70/80 spectrophotometer (Bruker Optiks GmbH, Ettlingen,
Germany) with a MIRacle ATR attachment with a one-reflection diamond-coated
KRS-5 element. The IR spectrum was obtained with 40 scans at 4 cm–1 resolution, in a range of 400–4000 cm–1 using OPUS software (version 6.5) data management,
averaging six replicates of random spots on the membrane surface.
In particular, all of the modified membranes were completely dried
at ∼25 °C for 1 h before the analysis experiment.

4.3.1.1 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer ESCALAB 250 ultrahigh vacuum (1
× 10–9 bar) installed with an Al Kα X-ray
source (the beam size: 500 μm) and a monochromator was used
for all of the membrane samples. The survey spectra were recorded
with a pass energy (PE) of 150 eV, and high-energy resolution spectra
were recorded with PE 20 eV. Also, utilizing nonlinear least-squares
curve fitting, different elements fixed the experimental data to the
collected signals from C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s. To avoid charging effects,
all spectra were corrected to the carbon 1s peak positioned at 285.0
eV.

4.3.1.2 Ponceau S Staining
Ponceau S
staining solution consisted of 0.1% (w/v) Ponceau S in 5% (v/v) acetic
acid. The modified and unmodified PES membranes were immersed in the
staining solution (5 mL) and shaken on an orbital shaker for 5 min
at room temperature. Next, each membrane was rinsed with distilled
water (three times, 5 min each) to remove the excess dye, and the
membranes were photographed.

4.3.1.3 Surface
CA Measurement
The static
CA was determined using the sessile drop method with deionized water
by an OCA-20 CA analyzer (Data Physics Instruments, Filderstradt,
Germany). Membranes were dried completely in the oven at 25 °C
for 1.5 h, and then a droplet (2 μL) was applied onto the surface.
An image of the droplet was obtained immediately after it was dispensed
on the membrane surface; then, using SCA-20 software (DataPhysics),
the CA was calculated. Six replicate drops on a membrane sample were
used to obtain the average for that sample, and three replicate sample
membranes were measured. P-values were calculated
using the t-test with 18 data points (6 measurements
× 3 replicate membranes) for sample comparison.

4.4 Membrane Permeability
The water permeability
of membranes was tested using a dead-end stirred cell (Amicon stirred
cell—50 mL, EMD Millipore Corporation, USA). Milli-Q water
was added to the cell fitted with a membrane (42 mm diameter), and
a pressure of 1.0 bar was applied. The permeate was collected and
weighed every minute. An average of four measurements was used to
calculate the membrane permeability (Lp) using  where V (L) is the water
volume collected, A (m2) is the surface
area of the tested membrane, t (h) is the elapsed
time, and p (bar) is the applied pressure.

4.5 Contact Killing
A single P. aeruginosa colony from an LB agar plate was transferred
to a 10 mL sterile LB broth and cultured overnight at 30 °C.
From this liquid culture, 100 μL was transferred to a 10 mL
sterile LB broth and incubated for 9 h at 30 °C on a shaker at
150 rpm. When the optical density at 600 nm was ∼1.0 (corresponding
to ∼2.1 × 108 cfu/mL), the culture was serially
diluted to 10–4 of the original culture in sterile
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The control membranes (unmodified
PES membrane) and RWRWRWA-(Bpa)-modified membranes were cut into square
pieces (1 cm × 1 cm) and attached to a sterile glass slide using
a double-sided tape and placed inside a Petri dish. Bacterial culture
(50 μL) from the 10–4 dilution (approximately
1000 cells) was placed on the surface of the membrane and evenly spread
on the membrane by gently placing a sterile coverslip on top. The
membranes were then incubated for 3 h at rt. After incubation, the
modified and unmodified membranes and coverslips were washed with
500 μL of sterile PBS buffer.

4.5.1 Quantification
Using Plate Count
Hundred microliters was spread on LB agar
and incubated at 30 °C
overnight, and colony-forming units (cfu) were counted.

4.5.2 Visualization Using SEM
After the
membrane surfaces were incubated with the bacteria culture, the coverslips
were removed and 2.5% glutaraldehyde (100 μL) was added on the
surface at 4 °C and kept undisturbed overnight in a chemical
fume hood at rt. The samples were washed twice with PBS, and 1% osmium
tetraoxide (100 μL) was added on the surface and incubated for
1 h and then washed twice with PBS. Dehydration was carried out by
immersion in a gradient of aqueous ethanol solutions (50, 70, 90,
and 100%, v/v) for 15 min each and then tertiary butanol for 30 min.
The dehydrated sample was air dried, coated with gold particles, and
observed with SEM (Verios XHR 460L SEM).

4.6 Biofilm
Assay
The biofilm growth
assay46 was performed as described previously.35,47 Briefly, the AMP-modified UF membranes were cut into square pieces
(1 cm × 1 cm) and attached to a cover slip (24 mm × 40 mm)
by a double-sided tape. The samples were placed vertically in a flow
cell, and utilizing a peristaltic pump, a culture of P. aeruginosa (50 mL, OD ≈ 0.1 at 600 nm at
the exponential phase) was introduced. This was followed with sterile
LB media (15 L) for 96 h at 0.44 cm/min cross-flow velocity. The membrane-attached
cover slips were then removed, and 100 μL of the staining solution
[prepared by adding propidium iodide (1.5 μL, 20 mM) and SYTO
9 (1.5 μL, 3.34 mM) to an aqueous NaCl (0.997 mL, 0.1 M)] was
added to cover the biofilm surface and stored protected from light
for 20 min. Afterward, the membrane surfaces were gently washed (3×)
using an aqueous solution of NaCl (0.25 mL, 0.1 M). Next, the sample
membranes were observed under the CLSM (Zeiss LSM 510, META), with
Zeiss dry objective plan-NeoFluar (20× magnification and numerical
aperture of 0.5). The volume and average thickness of the biofilm
were quantitatively analyzed by Matlab 2015b with proprietary algorithms,
and the simulated biofilm images were generated from Imaris 3D imaging
software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland).48

4.7 Fluorescence Microscopy
P. aeruginosa solution was prepared as described
in the contact killing assay, and after being grown in LB to an optical
density at 600 nm of ∼1.0, the bacteria were suspended in PBS
for an OD600 of 1.0. P. aeruginosa solution (100 μL) was placed on the surfaces of the modified
membranes and the unmodified membrane. Also, to 100 μL of the P. aeruginosa solution, 10 μL of the peptide
solution (1 mg/mL) was added in an Eppendorf tube and served as an
internal positive control and all samples were incubated for 15–20
min at rt. After incubation, the membrane surfaces were washed with
sterile saline water and to these solutions containing bacteria, 100
μL of staining solution containing propidium iodide and SYTO
9 was added (prepared as above in the biofilm assay) and immediately
placed on a glass slide and covered with a clean cover slip for observation
under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axio Scope) using an excitation
wavelength of 450–490 nm and a 520 nm cutoff emission filter.
The samples were observed for 15 min. Images were obtained throughout
the observation time for still images, which were also complied into
a movie representing the entire observation period (see the Supporting Information) with AxioCam MRc digital
cameras at magnifications of ×1000.
