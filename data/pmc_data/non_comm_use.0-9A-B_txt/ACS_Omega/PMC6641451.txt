Crown ether exhibits
a high separation coefficient for lithium
isotope separation owing to its precise size selectivity to cations.
A crown ether-based solid–liquid extraction method for the
lithium isotope separation with a high extraction efficiency is regarded
as a valid alternative to the classic liquid–liquid method.
A chitosan-graft-benzo-15-crown-5-ether (CTS-g-B15C5)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) porous blend membrane for
lithium isotope adsorptive separation was fabricated by immersion–precipitation–phase
inversion. Results indicated that the finger-like structure of the
blend membrane was replaced gradually by a sponge-like structure with
the increase of the CTS-g-B15C5 concentration from
20 to 50 wt %. Meanwhile, the porosity and mechanical strength of
the blend membrane slightly decreased from 76.9% and 2.68 MPa to 72.5%
and 2.02 MPa, respectively, whereas the average pore size increased
from 0.33 to 0.73 μm. The obtained CTS-g-B15C5/PVA
(50/50 wt/wt) blend membrane exhibited a sponge-like asymmetrical
gradient structure and good mechanical strength and used for the solid–liquid
extraction experiment. It is found that the distribution coefficient
increased from 13.50 to 49.33, and the single-stage separation factor
increased from 1.008 to 1.046 with the immobilization amount of crown
ether from 1.07 to 2.60 mmol·g–1. It also meets
the acceptable separation factor of 1.03 in a large scale of lithium
isotope separation. In addition, 6Li and 7Li
were enriched in the solid or membrane phase and the aqueous phase,
respectively. In summary, the blend membrane has great potential applications
in the development of green and highly efficient membrane chromatography
for lithium isotope separation.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Lithium is the lightest
metal, and naturally occurring lithium
consists of two stable isotopes, 6Li (7.5%) and 7Li (92.5%).1 Both lithium isotopes have
been more and more attended in the nuclear power industry owing to
their different nuclear properties of thermal neutron adsorption.
As an important material for nuclear fusion reactors, 6Li can be cracked into tritium (T) and helium (He) by neutron bombarding. 7Li is usually utilized as a pH controller and a coolant for
the nuclear fusion reactors.2 Until now,
the mercury amalgam method has been the only method that has been
applied for lithium isotope separation on a large scale.3 However, a large amount of toxic element mercury
used in this technique gives rise to environmental and safety concerns.
Therefore, the development of a novel and high-efficiency method for
lithium isotope separation is of great challenge.

In the recent
decades, many other techniques have been developed
to separate the lithium isotope, such as electromigration,4,5 laser,6,7 electrochemical,8,9 solvent
extraction,10−12 chromatography,13,14 and membrane
separation.15 Among them, solvent extraction
and chromatography using crown ether as an extracting agent have been
proven to be effective techniques for lithium isotope separation.

Specifically, the derivatives of 15-crown-5 ether for the lithium
isotope adsorptive separation through liquid–liquid extraction
have been paid great attention. This is because the cavity size of
15-crown-5 ether (1.70 Å) is close to the diameter of Li+ (1.20 Å).16 For instance,
the separation factor obtained by liquid–liquid extraction
using benzo-15-crown-5 (B15C5) was approximately 1.042.17 However, the liquid–liquid extraction
system with a low extraction efficiency and a high loss rate of crown
ether limits its practical applications.

A crown ether-based
solid–liquid extraction method for lithium
isotope separation with a high extraction efficiency is regarded as
a valid alternative to the classic liquid–liquid method. For
example, Otake et al.18 proposed a phenol-type
B15C5 resin by chemical bonding for lithium isotope separation. The
maximum separation factor obtained was up to 1.033. The more important
is that the resin is producible. Further, Zhou et al.12 synthesized mesoporous silica materials doped with ionic
liquids and B15C5 for lithium isotope separation, and the separation
factor obtained was up to 1.046.

Recently, our group reported
that a polyvinyl alcohol-graft-benzo-15-crown-5 ether
(PVA-g-FB15C5) film was
prepared from PVA and 4′-formoxylbenzo-15-crown-5 ether (FB15C5),
and the maximum separation factor obtained by the solid–liquid
extraction system of the isopropanol–LiI/PVA-g-FB15C5 film at 20 °C was up to 1.060.19 Similarly, a polymer of the chitosan-graft-benzo-15-crown-5-ether
(CTS-g-FB15C5) polymer was synthesized via a Schiff
base reaction between FB15C5 and CTS.20 Results showed that the lithium isotope separation factor of CTS-g-FB15C5 polymer obtained was 1.037, which was higher than
the acceptable separation factor of 1.03 in a large scale of lithium
isotope separation.21

However, high
internal diffusion resistance and low separation
efficiency during the solid–liquid extraction by the resins
limit its practical application because of the low porosity and small
pore size of the resins. An alternative technique is to prepare a
porous functional polymeric membrane with a low internal diffusion
resistance so as to improve the separation efficiency.

As is
well known, CTS is a naturally nontoxic and biorenewable
polymer that is being extensively used in a number of applications.
For instance, Liu et al.22 successfully
developed a CTS macroporous membrane by a selected dissolution technology
using silica particles as the porogen agent. Li et al.23 also fabricated a CTS nanoporous membrane by
selective dissolution with polyethylene glycol as the porogen. However,
the CTS membrane shows a poor mechanical property because CTS has
a high molecular weight and hard backbones.24,25 Consequently, CTS blending with other polymers as the most common
approach could be used to solve the abovementioned issue.26,27

The aim of the present study is to prepare a CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA porous blend membrane and improve the lithium isotope
separation efficiency by solid–liquid extraction. Meanwhile,
the compatibility of the blend systems and the morphologies of the
blend membrane were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. The effects
of the immobilization amount of crown ether grafting onto CTS and
polymer morphology on the lithium isotope separation performance were
explored.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 DSC Analysis
of the Blend Polymer Systems
DSC was utilized to observe
the compatibility of CTS-g-FB15C5 and PVA at different
mass ratios, as shown in Figure 1. It can be seen in Figure 1a that there was
an endothermic peak at 125 °C, which was attributed to the dissociation
process of hydrogen of CTS-g-FB15C5.28 In addition, no significant glass-transition temperature
(Tg) was found in the experimental range.
The main reason is that CTS has a high Tg and will probably start to decompose before melting.29 The result was in agreement with the previous
works by Lewandowska30 and Wan et al.31 Further, it can also be found from Figure 1g that the melting
endothermic peak of pure PVA
with a relatively sharp and large curve can be observed at 232.0 °C.
Moreover, the peak of the endothermic curve gradually shifted from
220.9 to 230.0 °C with the increase of PVA content from 40 to
80 wt %. The reason is that there was a strong hydrogen bonding interaction
between CTS-g-FB15C5 and PVA.32 Particularly, the endothermic curve of the blend system
became sharper with the increase of PVA content in the blend system.
This indicated that the degree of PVA crystallization decreased after
blending with CTS-g-FB15C5. In consequence, it implied
that there is a good miscibility between CTS-g-FB15C5
and PVA polymers.

PVA blend

and (g) 0:100.

2.2 Characterization
of the Blend Membrane
2.2.1 Blend Membrane Morphologies
The
composition and viscosity of the casting solutions with different
mass ratios of CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA (7 wt % of polymer
concentration) are listed in 1. The blend membranes
were prepared via the immersion–precipitation–inversion
process. The SEM images of M0 (CTS-g-FB15C5 membrane),
M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 membranes are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that M0 (Figure 2a) and M1 (Figure 2b) exhibited a typical asymmetric
structure throughout with a finger-like support layer and a dense
skin layer. In addition, macrovoids appeared in the M1 membrane.33 Surprisingly, the finger-like structure of the
blend membrane was replaced gradually by a sponge-like structure with
the increase of the CTS-g-FB15C5 concentration from
30 wt % (M2) to 40 wt % (M3) (Figure 2b,c). On further increase to 50 wt % of CTS-g-FB15C5, a blend membrane with a completely sponge-like
structure (M4) was obtained, as shown in Figure 2d. The reason is that the viscosity of the
casting solution increased from 1057.5 to 1992.5 mPa·s with the
increase of the CTS-g-FB15C5 concentration from 20
to 50 wt %, leading to a slow mutual diffusion between the solvent
and the nonsolvent during phase inversion.34 Finally, the finger-like structure and the macrovoids in the polymeric
membranes were totally suppressed.

M0; (b) M1; (c) M2; (d)
M3; (e) M4; and (f) M5.

Table 1 Composition and Viscosity of Different
Casting Solutions
no.	mass ratio of CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA	coagulation bath temp (°C)	viscosity (mPa·s)	porosity (%)	average pore size (μm)	
M1	20:80	35	1057.5	76.9 ± 1.8	0.33	
M2	30:70	35	1650.0	75.5 ± 1.1	0.51	
M3	40:60	35	1820.0	74.3 ± 2.0	0.60	
M4	50:50	35	1992.5	72.5 ± 1.0	0.73	
M5	50:50	25	1977.5	75.9 ± 1.2	0.98	
Furthermore, M5 with sponge-like pores were
also obtained when
the coagulation bath temperature decreased from 35 to 25 °C,
as illustrated in Figure 2e. Differently, the pore size of M5 became smaller than that
of M4. To further observe the asymmetrical gradient structure of the
blend membranes, Figure 3 showed different parts of SEM photographs derived from the M4 membrane
at a large magnification.

Figure 3 SEM photographs of the M4 membrane: (a) upper
part of the cross
section; (b) middle part of the cross section; and (c) lower part
of the cross section.

Further, it can be found from Table 1 that the porosity of the resultant blend
membrane
slightly decreased from 76.9 to 72.5% with an increase in the concentration
of CTS-g-FB15C5 from 20 to 50 wt %, whereas its average
pore size increased from 0.33 to 0.73 μm. This is because a
higher CTS-g-FB15C5 concentration would result in
a delayed phase separation which caused the obtained membrane with
a sponge-like asymmetrical gradient structure and a loose top layer
structure. Specifically, the M5 membrane exhibited a porous structure
similar to that of the M4 membrane. However, both the average pore
size and the porosity of M5 were larger than those of the M4 membrane.
This can be interpreted that the affinity between the solvent and
the nonsolvent becomes weaker at a low coagulation bath temperature
so as to retard the fast nonsolvent intrusion.35 Under this condition, a larger average pore size and a
higher porosity were obtained (M4 and M5).

In addition, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed
to investigate the chemical components of the top surface and the
bottom surface of M4. The C/N/O atom ratios of M4 in the top and bottom
surfaces were 1:0.059:0.0466 and 1:0.06:0.455, respectively. This
implied that the top and bottom surfaces of the blend membranes have
the same chemical composition, and the two polymers (CTS-g-FB15C5 and PVA) are mixable at the ratio of 50/50 wt/wt.

2.2.2 Mechanical Property of Blend Membranes
The mechanical
property of blend membranes is illustrated in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 4, the breaking strength
and the elongation of the blend membranes gradually decreased from
2.68 MPa and 15.8% (M1) to 1.81 MPa and 8.7% (M3) with the increase
of the CTS-g-B15C5 concentration from 20 to 40 wt
%, respectively and then slightly increased to 2.02 MPa and 11.80%
(M4) when the CTS-g-B15C5 concentration further increased
to 50 wt %. It is well-known that the mechanical property of the CTS
polymer membrane can be improved if it blends with PVA.36 However, the mechanical property of the M4 membrane
was higher than that of the M3 membrane, which is related to the sponge-like
asymmetrical gradient structure without finger-like pores or macrovoids
(M4). Generally, the mechanical property of the membrane with the
sponge-like structure was better than that of the membrane with the
finger-like structure.

Figure 4 Mechanical property of blend membranes.

Furthermore, both the breaking strength and the
elongation of the
M5 membrane with a structure similar to the M4 membrane were lower
than those of the M4 membrane. This was closely related to the porosity.
The membrane with a low porosity or high compaction would exhibit
a good mechanic performance.

2.3 Lithium
Isotope Adsorption Separation
2.3.1 CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA Blend
Membrane for Lithium Ion Adsorption
The cross-linked CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend membranes obtained by the cross-linking
reaction for 60 min were introduced into the solid–liquid extraction
system to explore their lithium ion adsorption property, as demonstrated
in Figure 5. It can
be clearly seen from Figure 5 that the values of the distribution coefficient (Kd) first increased from 16.96 (M1) to 50.20
(M4) and then decreased to 42.23 (M5). This phenomenon is exactly
consistent with the average pore size of the blend membranes. On the
one hand, a large average pore size would bring about a low operating
pressure so as to reduce the mass-transfer resistance between crown
ether and lithium ion. Therefore, the mass-transfer efficiency was
enhanced, and the obtained Kd increased
gradually with the increasing of the average pore size. On the other
hand, further increase in the average pore size would decrease the
retention time of the lithium ion on the blend membrane. Simultaneously,
a portion of lithium ion solution flowed directly through the membrane
from the pore of the membrane without sufficient contact with the
crown ethers on the blend membranes during adsorption. In summary, Kd is closely related to the porous structure
of the blend membrane.

blend
membranes.

2.3.2 Effect
of the Immobilization Amount of Crown
Ether on Lithium Isotope Adsorptive Separation
As discussed
above, the M4 membrane with a sponge-like asymmetrical gradient structure
presented excellent lithium ion adsorption performance. The following
work is to investigate the effect of the immobilization amount of
crown ether on lithium isotope separation. The CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend membranes with different immobilization amounts
(IA) of crown ether were prepared under
the same preparation condition as with the M4 blend membrane. The
effects of the immobilization amount of crown ether on CTS, distribution
coefficient (Kd), and single-stage separation
factor (α) are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Effect of the immobilization amount on lithium isotope
separation.

It can be seen from Figure 6 that Kd increased from 13.50
to 49.33 and α also increased from 1.008 to 1.046 with an increase
of IA from 1.07 to 2.60 mmol·g–1. The main reason is that the crown ether molecules
dispersedly grafted on the CTS chains would increase the chance for
each crown ether molecule to complex with lithium ions and enhance
the efficiency of isotope adsorptive separation. The results were
in good agreement with the solid–liquid extraction results
obtained by the LiI–H2O/PVA-g-FB15C5
film system19 and the LiCl–methanol/PSF-g-AB15C5 polymer system.11 This
also implies that the separation performance obtained from the CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend membrane has also been improved. It is
noted that an acceptable separation factor for lithium isotope separation
in a large scale is 1.03.21 That is to
say, the CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend membrane has great
potential applications in the development of green and highly efficient
technologies for lithium isotope adsorptive separation.

In addition,
it was found that the light isotope (6Li)
and the heavy isotope (7Li) were enriched in the solid
(membrane) phase and the solution phase, respectively. This can be
explained by Bigeleisen’s theory.37 In general, 6Li is usually concentrated in the organic
phase, whereas 7Li is enriched in the aqueous phase in
traditional liquid (aqueous solution)–liquid (crown ether/CHCl3) extraction systems. The lithium ions adsorbed in the solid
phase had a lower hydratability than those in the solution phase,
and the bonding environment of B15C5 for the lithium isotope was not
changed after crown ethers were grafted onto CTS. That is to say,
the bonding environment of the CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend
membrane was weaker than that of the solution phase. According to
Bigeleisen’s theory, heavy isotopes are easily concentrated
in “stronger bonding environments”. Consequently, 6Li was concentrated in the solid phase (membrane) and 7Li was enriched in the aqueous phase.

2.3.3 Effect of CTS-g-B15C5 Polymer
Morphology on Lithium Isotope Adsorptive Separation
The CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend membrane and the CTS-g-FB15C5 film as extracting agents were used to investigate the influence
of the polymer morphology on Kd and α
under the same conditions and the immobilization amount of crown ether
(2.60 mmol·g–1). The results are shown in Table 2. It can be seen from Table 2 that the Kd obtained from the CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA
blend membrane using LiI aqueous solution as an extracting solution
was up to 49.33, which was much higher than that obtained from the
LiI–H2O/CTS-g-FB15C5 film (1.20).
This suggested that the adsorption property of lithium ions by the
CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend membrane as an extracting
agent was improved dramatically.

CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA membrane	49.33 ± 1.9	1.046 ± 0.002	
a LiI aqueous solution with a concentration
of 3 mg/L was used. All extraction experiments were performed for
30 min at 20 °C.

Further,
the α value obtained by the CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA
blend membrane was 1.046, which was also higher than
that obtained from the CTS-g-FB15C5 film (1.035).
The main reason is that the crown ether molecules grafted on the CTS
film had a low probability to contact with the lithium ion, and the
Li+-crown ether complex mostly formed on the surface of
the CTS-g-FB15C5 film. However, the CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend membrane is a porous material with a porosity of
72.5%, and the crown ether molecules of the blend membrane were easily
and fully utilized to complex lithium ions. The formed Li+-crown ether complex not only existed on the porous surface of the
blend membrane but also in internal pores. For this reason, a larger Kd and α were obtained from the extraction
system of the LiI–H2O/CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA
blend membrane. Similarly, the heavy isotope (7Li) was
concentrated in the aqueous phase, and the light one (6Li) was concentrated in the CTS-g-FB15C5 film and
the CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend membrane, respectively.

In comparison, the lithium isotope separation performance of FB15C5
was conducted by typical liquid–liquid extraction.38 The results are also illustrated in Table 2. It can be found
from Table 2 that α
obtained from the H2O–LiI/CHCl3–FB15C5
liquid–liquid extraction system was 1.022, which was obviously
lower than that obtained from the CTS-g-FB15C5 film
(1.035) and the CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend membrane (1.046).
This showed that the lithium isotope separation effect was improved
by grafting crown ether onto a CTS polymer.

3 Experimental Sections
3.1 Materials
CTS
powder with a degree
of deacetylation of 87.3% and a molecular weight cutoff of 540 kDa
was purchased from National Pharmaceutical Group of China Ltd., Beijing,
China. FB15C5 was prepared by the method that Ungaro et al.39 reported. PVA with a degree of polymerization
of 1750 ± 50 was purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Technology Development
Co. Ltd., China. All other reagents were analytical reagent and obtained
from Tianjin Guangfu Technology Development Co. Ltd. without further
purification.

3.2 Preparation of the CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA
Blend Membrane
The CTS-g-FB15C5 polymer
was prepared as described by Changhong et al.40 The dissociative crown ethers were further washed with ethanol in
a Soxhlet extractor for 48 h. The CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA
blend membrane was prepared by an immersion–precipitation–phase
inversion process.41 First, the CTS-g-FB15C5 polymer was dissolved in 2% (v/v) acetic acid at
30 °C for 6 h. At the same time, PVA was dissolved in distilled
water at 90 °C for 6 h and cooled to room temperature. Then,
CTS-g-FB15C5 solution and PVA solution were mixed
in a certain weight proportion. The obtained mixture solution was
stirred at room temperature for 6 h to form a homogeneous solution
and degassed to remove microbubbles for another 12 h. Subsequently,
the casting solution was casted using an automated membrane applicator
(Elcometer 4340, England) with a gap of 800 μm on a clean glass
plate at a certain temperature and then immersed into a coagulation
bath with saturated Na2SO4 solution for the
immersion–precipitation process at 35 °C for 30 min to
prepare the blend membrane. After that, the obtained blend membrane
was immersed into a bath with a chemical cross-linking agent of 0.03
mol/L glutaraldehyde, 0.96 mol/L saturation sodium, and 0.15 mol/L
concentrated sulfuric acid at 20 °C for 60 min for the cross-linking
reaction to improve the chemical stability of the blend membrane in
aqueous solution or acidic medium.42 The
Schiff Base was also stable in the process of membrane fabrication
because of the existence of benzene rings.43 Finally, the cross-linked CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend
membrane was obtained after freeze-drying for 12 h.

3.3 Characterization of the Polymer Blend System
and Membrane
DSC (DSC2014F1, Germany) analysis of blend systems
was carried out to observe the endothermic peak in the temperature
range of 25–250 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The content of CTS-g-FB15C5 in the blend systems
varied from 100 to 0%.

XPS (Thermo Fisher K-Alpha) with a monochromated
Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) was
used to further study the top and bottom surface chemical change of
the blend membranes. The range of 0–1350 eV of the survey spectrum
including the high-resolution C 1s spectra was collected, and the
surface elemental composition was calculated from the peak area with
a correction for atomic sensitivity.

The morphologies of the
cross-linked CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA
blend membranes were characterized by SEM (Zeiss Gemini SEM 500).
The average pore size of the blend membranes was examined by a pore
size analyzer (Bei-Shi-De 3H–2000PB, China). Membrane porosity
was determined by a dry–wet weight method. At first, a certain
area of the membrane sample was maintained in distilled water and
weighed after removing the superficial water using a filter paper.
Then, the wet membrane was dried under a vacuum condition at 40 °C
for 12 h up to a constant weight, and the dry membrane weight was
measured. The porosity of the blend membrane was calculated by eq 1.44 1  where ε is the porosity of membrane
(%); w1 and w2 are the weights of the wet and dry membranes (g), respectively.
ρm is the density of distilled water (g/cm3). A is the area of the membrane, and d is the thickness of the membrane (cm2).

The immobilization
amount (IA) (mmol/g)
of crown ethers on PSF chains was determined by an elemental analyzer
(Vario EL/micro cube), as defined by eq 2(45) 2  where wN % is
the nitrogen content of the graft polymers determined by the elemental
analyzer, and 14 is the atomic weight of nitrogen.

3.4 Lithium Isotope Adsorptive Separation
To determine
the single-stage separation factor of lithium isotope
separation by the blend membrane, a dynamic cyclic adsorption mode,
that is, solid–liquid extraction was employed. Firstly, the
CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend membrane was fixed in a flat-sheet
membrane module with a diameter of 51.4 mm. LiI aqueous solution (3
mg/L, 100 mL) as an extracting solution flowed through the membrane
at a speed of 15 mL/min at 20 °C and then recycled back to the
feed tank. After extracting for 30 min, the concentration of lithium
ions in the aqueous solution was determined by inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectrometry (Varian 715). The distribution
coefficient, Kd, can be calculated from
the initial and final lithium ion concentrations by eq 3.46 3  where Kd is the
distribution coefficient; C0 is the initial
concentration of the lithium ion (mg/L); Ce is the final lithium ion concentration after extraction (mg/L); Vl is the volume of lithium salt solution (mL);
and Vm is the volume of the CTS-g-B15C5/PVA blend membrane (mL).

After complexing
with lithium ions, the blend membrane was flushed with ultrapure water
at a flow rate of 15 mL/min to remove the Li+ ions. Subsequently,
the ratio of isotopic 6Li/7Li in the obtained
aqueous solution could be measured by high-resolution inductively
coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Finnigan MAT, Germany). The single-stage
separation factor, α, can be calculated by eq 4.46 4  where [6Li]/[7Li] represents
the isotopic ratio. The subscripts of m and i refer to the stationary
phase (membrane) and the initial solution phase, respectively.

4 Conclusions
A CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend
membrane was successfully
prepared for the selective separation of lithium isotopes by the immersion–precipitation–phase
inversion process. The morphologies and performance of the blend membrane
were affected by the addition of PVA. It was found that the CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend system exhibited a good blend compatibility
owning to the strong hydrogen-bonding interaction between CTS-g-FB15C5 and PVA polymers, resulting in a delayed demixing
and the obtained membrane with a sponge-like asymmetrical gradient
structure with the increase of the CTS-g-B15C5 concentration
from 20 to 50 wt %. Simultaneously, the porosity and mechanical strength
of the blend membrane slightly decreased from 76.9% and 2.68 MPa to
72.5% and 2.02 MPa, respectively, whereas the average pore size increased
from 0.33 to 0.73 μm. The obtained CTS-g-B15C5/PVA
(50/50 wt/wt) blend membrane exhibited a sponge-like asymmetrical
gradient structure and good mechanical strength. The distribution
coefficient of the CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend membrane
increased from 13.50 to 49.33, and the separation factor also increased
from 1.008 to 1.046 with an increase of IA from 1.07 to 2.60 mmol·g–1. Further, the
remarkable separation factor obtained by the LiI–H2O/CTS-g-FB15C5/PVA blend membrane extraction system
was up to 1.046, which was higher than those obtained by the CTS-g-FB15C5 film (1.035) and FB15C5 (1.022). This indicated
that the lithium isotope separation effect was improved by grafting
crown ether onto CTS polymers. Furthermore, the heavy isotope, 7Li, was enriched in the aqueous phase, whereas the lighter
one, 6Li, was concentrated in the film or membrane phase.
In a word, the blend membrane has great potential applications in
the development of green and highly efficient technologies including
membrane chromatography for lithium isotope separation.
