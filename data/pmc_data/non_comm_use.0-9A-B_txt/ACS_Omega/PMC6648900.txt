Thorium
(Th4+) and cerium (Ce4+) phosphonates have been
synthesized by the sol–gel method using various phosphonic
acids and analyzed using elemental and CHN analysis, spectral analysis
(Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction), thermogravimetric
analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy. The proton transport study was performed by measuring
proton conductance at different temperatures using an impedance analyzer.
The Grotthuss mechanism of the proton conduction has been discussed
thoroughly on the basis of results obtained from the impedance measurement;
the specific proton conduction (σ) and activation energy (Ea) have been evaluated and compared with the
reported proton-conducting system having similar phosphonate moieties.

1 Introduction
Metal phosphonates are a novel type of metal–organic hybrid
porous material that exhibit high water, chemical, and thermal stabilities.1,2 The tetrahedral phosphonic acids (O3P–OR or O3P–R) are obtained when −H or −OH of the
phosphoric acid (O3P–OH) is replaced by alkyl/aryl
(−R) groups, which are reacted with metal ions such as Zr4+, Ti4+, Sn4+, Ce4+, Th4+, and so forth to synthesize M+4-phosphonates.3−5 The flexible coordination sites and strong coordination
attachment of the phosphonate ligand (phosphonic acid) can form a
variety of metal phosphonates possessing significant structures and
promising characteristics. This could depend on the structural type
of the phosphonic acid and the synthetic route used, where there are
two- or three-dimensional inorgano-organic hybrid polymeric structures
in which organic species are bridged via phosphorous atoms to an inorganic
two-dimensional matrix.1 The proton exchange/transport
can be enhanced through the surface or interlayer region of metal
phosphonate compared to that of metal phosphate because of the presence
of such organic functional groups acting as the proton source.6 Boilot et al. have reported the synthesis of
Zr4+-phosphate and -phosphonate using organic covalent
grafting with phosphoric acid and phosphonic acid, respectively. The
study shows that Zr4+-phosphonate has higher/enhanced proton
conductivity compared to Zr4+-phosphate, which is due to
the grafting of the P–OH groups.7 Hogarth et al. have also demonstrated that the modification or variation
of a number of experimental parameters of the synthetic route, such
as the sol–gel method, could be favorable for improving hydration
and thus proton conduction.8

From
the literature survey, there are many reports on the synthesis and
characterization, in which metal phosphonates are used as proton conductors.
Demadis et al.9 have prepared crystalline
phosphonocarboxylates of Li+, Na+, K+, and Cs+ metal ions using hydroxyphosphonoacetate. As
a result, all solid materials show comparable good proton conductivity,
which could be due to the structural role of water molecules and the
hydrogen-bonding networks.9 Cabeza et al.10 also have reported the crystalline structure
of Ca2+-phosphonate using 5-(dihydroxyphosphoryl)isophthalic
acid, which has −COOH as protogenic groups exhibiting good
proton conductivity in range of magnitude of 10–3 S·cm–1. The authors11 also have reported the solvothermal synthesis of Mg2+-phosphonate using hexamethylenediamine-tetra(methylenephosphonic
acid), which shows remarkable proton conductivity (in the range of
∼10–5 S·cm–1) because
of having P–OH and −NH+ groups as proton
sources. Ploehn et al.12 have prepared
polymer composite materials using a combination of mixed metals and
phenylphosphonic acid (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Pb) and explored its dielectric
permittivity, which was found to be higher than its parent composite
material. Klapper et al.13 have synthesized
Al3+-phosphonate by using hexakis(p-phosphonatophenyl)benzene,
which exhibits notable proton conductivity (∼10–3 S·cm–1) close to that for Nafion. The enhanced
conductivity may be due to the regular pore size distribution, which
could make the lattice H2O molecules or other guest ions/molecules
easy to be trapped.13

Among the transition-metal
ions, phosphonates of tetravalent metal ions (Zr14,15 and Ti16−19) have been extensively studied because of their very good thermal
and chemical stabilities along with good proton conduction behavior.
Vivani et al.14 have prepared Zr4+-phosphate and Zr4+-phosphonate based on glyphosine using
the Moedritzer–Irani synthesis route in the mild condition.
The proton conduction behavior was studied as a function of temperature
and relative humidity, which shows that the conductivity of ∼10–3 S·cm–1 is essentially because
of the surface proton transport.14 Costantino
et al.20 have studied proton-transport
properties of Zr4+-phosphonate, where the proton conductivity
values are found in the range of 10–3 S·cm–1 at different temperatures and humidities.20 Bhaumik et al.5 have
synthesized porous Sn4+-phosphonate and explored its utility
as a solid acid catalyst for esterification because of the high surface
area and crystalline structure of the material. Kitagawa et al.21 have investigated homochiral nanotubular metal
phosphonates of Ni2+ and Co2+ using (1-phenylethylamino)methylphosphonate
and studied the proton conduction behavior where proton conductivity
is observed with a magnitude of ∼10–6 S·cm–1. The authors also have reported proton conductivity
in the range of 10–12 S·cm–1 for Co2+-phosphonate using (benzylazanediyl)bis(methylene)diphosphonic
acid.22 Schröder et al.23 have studied a model “free diffusion
inside a sphere” for the proton conduction mechanism of the
phosphonate-based metal–organic framework and confirmed proton
conduction in Ni2+/Co2+-benzene-1,3,5-p-phenylphosphonate. Shimizu et al.24 have the synthesized phosphonate metal–organic framework
of inorganic-organic solid Zn2+-1,3,5-benzenetriphosphonate
and explored its proton-transport properties through observed conductivity
in the region of ∼10–6 S·cm–1.

Among lanthanide metal phosphonate, Krautscheid et al.25 have reported the hydrothermal synthesis of
La3+-triazolyl-phosphonate-based hybrid metal–organic
framework materials. The results show that the proton conductivity
was significantly enhanced with increasing temperature and relative
humidity, which could be due to the availability of the charge-carrier
concentration and maintaining high charge density, respectively. Shimizu
et al.2 also have prepared highly acidic
porous La3+-phosphonate using 1,2,4,5-tetrakisphosphonomethylbenzene,
which shows good water stability and very good proton conductivity
(∼10–3 S·cm–1). Cabeza
et al.26 have reported the proton conduction
behavior of crystalline La3+-tetraphosphonates. Zang et
al.27 have prepared Eu3+-phosphonate,
which shows good anhydrous proton conductivity (∼10–3 S·cm–1). Demadis et al.28 have synthesized phosphonates of lanthanide metals such
as La, Pr, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and so forth. The materials exhibit
comparable proton conduction values of ∼10–3 S·cm–1, which remain stable for the work
conditions used. Paz et al.29 have reported
microwave-assisted synthesis of porous Y3+-phosphonate.
As a result, the material possesses very good thermal stability and
excellent proton conduction value (∼10–2 S·cm–1) under ambient conditions. Yuan et al.30 have prepared mesoporous cerium phosphonate
nanostructured hybrid material by incorporating the cationic surfactant
with cerium and organo-phosphonic functionalities by using the template
method, thereby showing very good efficiency to be used as an optical
sensor.

The discussed reports expose the significance of the
metal phosphonate, and the materials could be used as effective solid-state
proton conductors by varying the synthesis route as well as various
phosphonic acids. The reports also demonstrate the way to investigate
novel proton-conducting materials and to understand the conduction
mechanism is now a prior demand, the promising use of these materials
being in catalysis, fuel cells, sensors, and so forth. Earlier, we
prepared amorphous M4+-phosphates and -phosphonates (M
= Zr, Sn, and Ti) and studied their proton conduction behavior.6,31−34 Literature survey shows that not much research has focused toward
phosphonates of thorium (Th4+) and cerium (Ce4+). In our earlier report,35 we synthesized
thorium and cerium phosphates and measured proton conductivity, where
fairly good conductivity was observed in the range of ∼10–7 S·cm–1. Therefore, we aim
to study thorium and cerium phosphonates containing more protonic
sites (P–OH groups) in the organo-phosphonate species, and
hence enhanced proton conductivity was expected. HEDP (1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic
acid),6,34 ATMP (amino tris(methylenephosphonic acid)),6 EDTMP (ethylenediamine tetra(methylenephosphonic
acid)), and DETPMP (diethylenetriamine penta(methylenephosphonic acid))6 are phosphonic acids containing structural hydroxyl
(−OH) groups of five, six, eight, and ten, respectively (Figure S1).

The current study deals with
the synthesis, characterization, and proton-transport performance
of thorium phosphonates (ThHEDP, ThATMP, ThDETPMP, and ThEDTMP) and
cerium phosphonates (CeHEDP, CeATMP, CeDETPMP, and CeEDTMP). On the
basis of the obtained results, the specific proton conduction (σ)
and activation energy (Ea) have been evaluated
and compared among the cerium and thorium phosphonates and with that
of other proton-conducting systems of metal-organophosphonates.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Material Characterization
Thorium(IV) phosphonates and cerium(IV) phosphonates were observed
as hard granules with off-white and pale yellowish appearance, respectively.
As discussed earlier in the text for physicochemical and ion-exchange
characteristics, the results for all materials have been presented
in Supporting Information Tables S1–S8.
Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES)
results for thorium-phosphonate are as follows: for ThHEDP, % Th =
47.18 and % P = 12.40, for ThATMP, % Th = 40.20 and % P = 16.50, for
ThDETPMP, % Th = 21.45 and % P = 14.52, and for ThEDTMP, Th = 27.10
and P = 15.36. For CeHEDP, % Ce = 47.18 and % P = 12.40, for CeATMP,
% Ce = 40.20 and % P = 16.50, for CeDETPMP, % Ce = 21.45 and % P =
14.52, and for CeEDTMP, Ce = 27.10 and P = 15.36. Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) graphs (Figures S2–S9) are in correlation with the found elemental analysis.

From
the CHN analysis data, %C = 5.10, % H = 3.20 in ThHEDP, % C = 6.0,
% H = 3.56, % N = 2.09 in ThATMP, % C = 10.44, % H = 3.88, % N = 4.06
in ThDETPMP, and % C = 8.48, % H = 2.74, % N = 3.64 in ThEDTMP. For
cerium-phosphonates, % C = 7.45, % H = 3.16 in CeHEDP, % C = 7.38,
% H = 3.05, % N = 2.48 in CeATMP, % C = 12.91, % H = 4.33, % N = 4.91
in CeDETPMP, and % C = 11.09, % H = 3.59, % N = 4.14 in CeEDTMP. The
observed CHN analysis data can be correlated with those of theoretical
values.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of thorium phosphonates
(Figure 1) and cerium
phosphonates (Figure 2) shows two major weight loss regions, where loss of moisture/hydrated
water occurs up to ∼120 °C and in the temperature range
of 120–180 °C. The first weight loss can be assigned to
more than one water molecule. The second weight loss occurred in two
steps (except in the case of ThHEDP and ThATMP), namely, in the range
180–350 and 350–500 °C and is due to the condensation
of structural hydroxyl (−OH) groups, decomposition of organic
moieties, and transformation of the dehydrated compound into metal
pyrophosphate because of the collapse of the structure at a high temperature.32

Figure 2 TGA of cerium phosphonates.

From the ICP–AES, CHN, and TGA data, ThHEDP, ThATMP,
ThDETPMP, and ThEDTMP were determined to have the formula as Th(C2H8P2O7)·4H2O, Th(C3H12P3O9N)·3H2O, Th(C9H28P5O15N3)·8H2O, and Th(C6H20P4O12N2)·10H2O,
respectively. Similarly, CeHEDP, CeATMP, CeDETPMP, and CeEDTMP have
the formula as Ce(C2H8P2O7)·5H2O, Ce(C3H12P3O9N)·5H2O, Ce(C9H28P5O15N3)·6H2O, and
Ce(C6H20P4O12N2)·3H2O, respectively, where the Alberti and Torracca
(1968) formula36 has been used to calculate
the H2O molecules.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of thorium and cerium phosphonates (Figures 3 and 4) indicate that
the materials are amorphous in nature because of the absence of sharp
peaks. The observed peak at ∼28 2θ scale in Figures 3 and 4 shows the presence of a large amount of amorphous carbon
material.37 Exceptionally, in the case
of CeHEDP, sharp peaks were observed indicating the material to be
of crystalline nature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of
the materials (Figures S10–S17)
show an irregular morphology.

A broad band observed in the region ∼3400 cm–1 for
in the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of thorium
phosphonates (Figure 5) and cerium phosphonates (Figure 6) due to symmetric and asymmetric O–H stretching
vibrations of structural −OH groups represent exchangeable/protonic
sites (H+ of the −OH groups), which are referred
to as defective P–OH groups.38 The
broad band at ∼1040–1100 cm–1 and
a sharp medium band at ∼1630–1640 cm–1 are due to aliphatic P=O stretching and aquo H–O–H
bending, respectively.39 The band at ∼1450–1475
cm–1 is due to overlapped C–H bending of
−CH2 groups, P–C stretching vibrations, and
the presence of a secondary amine for ATMP and a tertiary amine for
DETPMP and EDTMP.40

The protonating ability [Na+-cation exchange capacity (CEC)] has been determined as 3.25,
2.68, 1.74, 1.97, 2.58, 2.60, 3.41, and 2.32 mequiv·g–1 for ThHEDP, ThATMP, ThDETPMP, ThEDTMP, CeHEDP, CeATMP, CeDETPMP,
and CeEDTMP, respectively, at room temperature. The calcination study
(effect of heating up to 500 °C in the interval of 50 °C)
shows that CEC values gradually reduce with heating because of removal
of hydrated water and condensation of −OH groups representing
the presence of protonic sites (Tables S1–S8).32 The FTIR spectra
(Figure S18) of the calcined samples are
also in favor of the above observations, which could be highlighted
as disappearance or decreasing the intensities of the peaks at ∼3400
and ∼1638 cm–1 responsible for the −OH
group.32,39

2.2 Impedance Analysis
The Nyquist plot (imaginary Z″ vs the real Z′ components of the impedance vector Z) consists in a single depressed semicircle, representing the frequency
response of the pellet.40−42 In each experiment, the pellet
specific conductivity (σ) is derived from the sample impedance
(R) (which is getting through extrapolation of the
frequency curve crossing to the Z′ axis) and
the thickness (d) and surface area (A) of the pellet. During the pellet preparation of
the samples, no structural changes occur, suggesting that no irreversible
transformations occur during conductivity measurement at different
temperatures.

Figures 7 and 8 show the complex impedance plots
(at 30 °C) for thorium phosphonate and cerium phosphonate, respectively.
As a result (Tables 1 and 2), the tendency of specific conductance
values (σ) is parallel as observed earlier,6,35 where
σ decreases with increasing temperature in each case. These
results are well supported by the calcination study and thus the trend
of the loss of water of hydration as well as condensation of structural
hydroxyl (−OH) groups. The observations indicate that proton
conduction occurs through a Grotthuss-type mechanism43 where the conductivity is facilitated by the hydrated water
located on the surface and hence protons are able to diffuse through
the interlayer space, which makes materials to be proton conductors.44 This is well understood by the calcination studies
where loss of protonic sites observed because of condensation of –OH
groups which have an effect on proton conductance as conductivity
decreases with increasing temperature also favoring to be the conduction
is protonic.

The order of specific conductance
at 30 °C (Table 1) is found to be ThHEDP (5.39 × 10–6 S·cm–1) > ThEDTMP (1.06 × 10–6 S·cm–1) > ThATMP (6.73 × 10–7 S·cm–1) > ThDETPMP (5.86 × 10–7 S·cm–1). Similarly (Table 2), the order of specific
conductance at 30 °C for cerium phosphonate is observed to be
as follows: CeHEDP (8.30 × 10–7 S·cm–1) > CeEDTMP (4.17 × 10–7 S·cm–1) > CeATMP (3.95 × 10–7 S·cm–1) > CeDETPMP (3.83 × 10–7 S·cm–1). The observations
resulting from such effective factors are ease with which a proton
can jump to another sites, availability of conducting protonic sites,
and complexity in structure.45,46 The proton conductivity
of the solid material is also affected by the high density of charge
carriers, crystallinity of the material, surface layer of particles
of a sample, a number of vacant-accessible sites, coordinated metal
ion size, temperature, hydrophobicity, activation energy (Ea), and so forth.45−47

The conductivity
variation observed along with a change in temperature allows calculating
the activation energy (Ea) from the Arrhenius
plots of log(σT) versus 1000/T. The obtained Ea values result from
the contribution of many characteristics such as the concentration
of mobile ions (protons), a number of vacant sites, good connectivity
among the sites, the structure of used phosphonic acid, and the charge-to-size
ratio of the coordinated metal ions.48 In
the temperature range of 90–120 °C, the Arrhenius fit
to the data shows the activation energy (Tables 1 and 2), and linearity
is observed in Arrhenius plots in the range of 90–120 °C
(Figures 9 and 10). The Grotthuss mechanism has been used to understand
the proton transport in solid compounds. The lower values of Ea (0.06–0.20 kcal·mol–1 for cerium phosphonate and 0.3–1.9 kcal·mol–1 for thorium phosphonate) show easy proton transportation following
the Grotthuss type mechanism, where lower activation energy (Ea) is observed, which totally corresponds to
participation of water (H2O) molecules on the solid surface.44 The result regarding the low Ea values were also reported earlier by Clearfield and
Yaroslavtsev.46,47

On comparing various phosphonate moieties, the HEDP containing well-spaced five −OH (structural
hydroxyl) groups shows low Ea values and
high values of proton conductivity. In the case of ATMP species, it
contains six −OH groups compared to HEDP. In the case of DETPMP
and EDTMP, both contain more number of −OH groups (10 and 12,
respectively), because of which more number of protonic sites (H+ of the −OH) are expected to have higher conductivity
values. On the other hand, higher values of Ea in the case of ATMP and EDTMP are attributed to the steric
effect of structures of both the phosphonic acids.6 Comparison was done among the coordinated metal ions (Th4+ and Ce4+) where thorium phosphonates exhibit
higher proton conductivity compared to cerium phosphonates. The results
could be attributed to higher CEC values giving more exchangeable
protons of −OH groups and thus more available conducting protons.
Higher conductivity values were observed for ThHEDP than CeHEDP followed
by CEC values, and a similar trend was observed in the case of ThATMP
and CeATMP. The observed conductivity order could be correlated with
the acidic character of the metal ions, which is related to ionic
radii, charge, and coordinate site (phosphonic acids) of coordinated
metal ions (0.97 Å for Ce4+ and 1.05 Å for Th4+). In addition, randomness is observed for ThDETPMP and ThEDTMP
and CeDETPMP and CeEDTMP where the proton conductivity data do not
follow CEC values. For this explanation, the physicochemical characteristics
are effective factors, where cerium phosphonates, CeDETPMP and CeEDTMP,
were obtained at a very low yield in a powder form, which may affect
pellet formation while thorium phosphonates were obtained with good
yields, and hard glassy material was found to be easy to make a pellet.
We also have performed chemical and thermal stability studies for
each case where cerium phosphonates (CeDETPMP and CeEDTMP) were comparatively
not stable among all synthesized materials. Materials are observed
to be resistant to acidic medium and the organic solvents studied but
not suitable with base medium, and maximum tolerable limits have been
presented in the Supporting Information—Tables S1–S8.

The comparison made
with the reported proton conducting system possessing similar organo-phosphonates.
The present synthesized materials are less conductive than reported
materials (such as zirconium (Zr4+)-6 and titanium (Ti4+)-33phosphonates), may be due to acidic nature
of the metal ions employed to obtain the metal4+-phosphonates.
The acidic character of the coordinated metal ions is related to ionic
radii, charge, and coordinate site (phosphonic acids). Zr4+ (0.86 Å) and Ti4+ (0.74 Å) with smaller ionic
radii and hence a high charge density shows higher proton conduction
compared to cerium- and thorium-phosphonates (the bigger the cation,
the higher the proton conductivity).49,50 The observed
specific conductivity trend is ZrHEDP6 (4.13
× 10–4) > TiHEDP33 (1.34 × 10–4) and ThHEDP (5.39 × 10–6) > CeHEDP (8.30 × 10–7).
Further, the obtained Ea values for ThHEDP
(0.68 kcal·mol–1) and CeHEDP (0.14 kcal·mol–1) are a result of the contribution of such factors
as discussed earlier in the text and low compared to ZrHEDP (2.36
kcal·mol–1)6 and
TiHEDP (2.87 kcal·mol–1).33 Stenina et al. have reported that high Ea values are because of strong H-bonds existing between
the structural −OH groups in the metal-phosphonates, and hence
more energy is required for proton transfer from one site to another.51

3 Conclusions
The
aim was to investigate the proton-transport performance of thorium
(Th4+)- and cerium (Ce4+)-phosphonates. In conclusion,
considering the comparable proton conductivity and good thermal and
chemical stabilities, the synthesized materials exhibit promising
characteristics to be used in several applications in the field of
materials science. Further, many studies based on the preparation
methods of metal phosphonates and alternative synthetic routes would
help tune the surface characteristics possessing more exchangeable
sites with the unexpected features and hence better proton conduction.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Thorium
nitrate (Th(NO3)4·5H2O) and
ceric sulfate (Ce(SO4)2·6H2O)
were procured from Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd. Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.
HEDP, 50% (∼4.25 M) [density (D) = 1.75 g/cm3 and molecular weight (MW) = 206.02 g (CAS no. 2809-21-4)],
ATMP, 50% (∼1.66 M) [D = 1.30 g/cm3 and MW = 299.05 g (CAS no. 6419-19-8)], EDTMP, 24.46% (∼0.72
M) [D = 1.28 g/cm3 and MW = 436 g (CAS
no. 1429-50-1)], and DETPMP, 50% (∼1.18 M) [D = 1.35 g/cm3 and MW = 573.2 g (CAS no. 15827-60-8)] were
purchased from Hydro Chem India Pvt. Ltd. Vadodara, Gujarat, India.
Deionized (DI) water has been used for each experiments.

4.2 Material Synthesis
In the context of material preparation,
the synthetic methods have always been proven as effective factors
that tune the material characteristics and hence the performance.
The sol–gel synthesis method is currently recognized as the
most important chemical method because of several advantages such
as employment of a low temperature, high homogeneity, stability and
flexibility of processing allowing varying reaction parameters.52 To have a material with very good CEC (also
called protonating ability) was the prior endeavour where the number
of experimental parameters has been optimized through sol–gel
synthesis route (the material synthesis given in Supporting Information—Tables S9–S16
describes optimization of experimental conditions for materials preparation).

4.3 Characterization
Physicochemical characteristics
for the synthesized materials were studied according to literature
methods.53,54 The protonating ability/CEC was measured
as Na+-CEC in mequiv·g–1 using the
earlier reported column method.55 Elemental
analysis for thorium, cerium, and phosphorus content was performed
by using ICP–AES (Thermo Electron IRIS Intrepid II XSP). The
percentage of elements C, H, and N was analyzed using a CHN analyzer
(Elementar Vario EL III). Spectral analysis was performed, and FTIR
spectra (Shimadzu, model 8400S, using KBr pellet) and XRD (2θ
= 10°–80°) patterns (Bruker, model AXS D8, with Cu
Kα radiation with a nickel filter) were obtained. TGA was performed
on a Shimadzu thermal analyzer (model TGA 50) at a heating rate of
10 °C·min–1. SEM and EDX were obtained
on a JEOL scanning electron microscope (model JSM-5610-SLV).

4.4 Proton Conductivity Studies
Impedance data were recorded
by performing impedance measurements as described in our earlier published
reports6,32,35 (Supporting Information Section S2).
