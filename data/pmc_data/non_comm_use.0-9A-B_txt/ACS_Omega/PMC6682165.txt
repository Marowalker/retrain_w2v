The
N-geminal P/Al Lewis pair [Ph2PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2]2 (1) has been prepared and studied for reaction with
a series of alkynes. The reaction of 1 with RC≡CR
yielded zwitterionic C2PNAl-heterocyclopentene [Ph2⌜PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2](CR=⌝CR) (R = Me
(2), Ph (3)); with PhC≡CEt produced
two isomers, [Ph2⌜PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2](CPh=⌝CEt) (4a) and [Ph2⌜PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2](CEt=⌝CPh) (4b); and with other alkynes generated
[Ph2⌜PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2](CR1=⌝CR2) (R1, R2 = CO2Et,
Ph (5); SiMe3, Ph (6); PPh2, Ph (7); SiMe3,H (8);
H, EtO (9)). Natural bond orbital analysis of the charge separation of the C≡C bond
of alkynes was carried out, and then, the electronic matching interaction
mode between the combined Lewis acid (AlEt2) and base (PPh2) groups of 1 and the C≡C bond of such
alkynes was discussed. Reactions of 1 with alkene, nitrile,
and carbodiimide molecules were also carried out, and cycloaddition
compounds 10–12 were produced.

Introduction
(Frustrated)
Lewis pair ((F)LP)–alkyne cycloaddition reactions
have been intensively explored in recent years, which can be considered
as method for synthesizing a novel class of multiple heteroatom-containing
cycles of zwitterionic nature.1 (F)LPs
that have Lewis acid and base groups intramolecularly linked by an
organic group are necessary for building the cycle compounds. Such
Lewis acid and base
groups undergo asynchronous but cooperative electrophilic and nucleophilic
reactions toward the C≡C bond of the alkyne.1,2 When
compared with the Huisgen–Sharpless azide–alkyne 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition, which is usually effected by catalysis of the transition
metals,3 the (F)LP–alkyne cycloaddition
is free from catalysis.1,2,4 However,
it has been reported that P/Sn(II) LPs Ph2PCHPhSn-2,6-Trip2C6H3 and Ph2PC6H4-o-Sn-2,6-Trip2C6H3 did react with the terminal alkyne, but this was not
the case for a similar LP, Ph2PC12H8-o-Sn-2,6-Trip2C6H3 (Trip = 2,4,6-iPr3C6H2).5,6 The Te/B FLP Ph(CH2)2TeC(Ph)=C(C6F5)B(C6F5)2 was tested to be reactive toward the terminal
alkyne but nonreactive toward the internal alkyne.7 Therefore, (F)LP–alkyne
cycloaddition relies on the reactivity of not only the Lewis acid
and base groups of the (F)LPs but also the alkyne substrate. A number
of (F)LPs have been investigated, which exhibit electronic and/or steric reaction
characteristics of the Lewis acid and base groups.1,2,4 The reactivity of the alkynes depends on the C≡C bond nature and where the
C≡C bond reactivity is usually influenced by its substituents.
Currently, only a handful of (F)LP–alkyne cycloadditions to
zwitterionic heterocycloalkenes of A,7,8 B,9 C,10 D,11 and E5,6 types have been documented
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Reported
Zwitterionic Heterocycloalkenes Formed by (F)LP–alkyne
Cycloadditions
More recently, we
have prepared amino group-bridged N-geminal P/Si,
P/Ge, and P/Sn FLPs, whose reactivity is unquenched.12 The P/Si and P/Ge FLPs reacted readily with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate
or methyl propiolate to produce zwitterionic heterocyclopentenes [Ph2PN(Ar)MR3][C(CO2Me)=CR′]
(MR3 = SiCl3, SiCl2Me, SiClMe2, Ar = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2, 2,6-iPr2C6H3, R′ = CO2Me; MR3 = GeCl3, Ar = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2, 2,6-iPr2C6H3, C6H11, R′ = CO2Me; MR3 = SiCl3, GeCl3, Ar
= 2,4,6-Me3C6H2, R′ = H).12 However, these FLPs did not react with other
alkynes (R1C≡CR2: R1, R2 = Me, Me; Ph, Ph; Ph, Et; Ph, CO2Et; Ph, SiMe3; Ph, PPh2; H, SiMe3; and EtO, H). These
results suggest the weak Lewis acid reactivity of the SiR3 and GeCl3 groups. This prompted an amelioration of this
type of FLPs, and in this regard, alternation of the SiR3 (or GeCl3) group with an aluminum-containing group was
considered. (Aluminoamino)phosphines, Ph2PN(R)AlR′2 (R, R′ = iPr, Me; iPr, Et; tBu, Et; tBu, Ph; and Ph,
Me), have been synthesized, which showed amphoteric reactivity toward
(η5-C5H5)Fe(CO)2Me and other metal carbonyls.13 Hydrocarbon
group-linked P/Al LPs, (R12PCH2AlR22)2 (R1, R2 =
Me, Me; Me, Cl; Ph, Me; and tBu, Me),14 and FLPs, Mes2PC(=CHR)AlR′2 (R, R′ = Ph, tBu and tBu, CH2tBu),11 have also been reported, which exhibited remarkable reactivities
with a variety of small molecules, such as alkynes, CO2, aldehydes, benzoyl chloride, benzamide, and isocyanates.15 Herein, we prepared an amino group-bridged N-geminal
P/Al LP, [Ph2PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2]2 (1). The reaction of 1 with RC≡CR
yielded [Ph2⌜PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2](CR=⌝CR) (R = Me
(2), Ph (3)) and with the other molecules
generated [Ph2⌜PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2](CR1=⌝CR2) (R1, R2 = CO2Et, Ph (5), SiMe3, Ph (6), PPh2, Ph (7), SiMe3, H (8), and H, EtO (9)). However, reaction with PhC≡CEt
produced two isomers, [Ph2⌜PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2](CPh=⌝CEt) (4a) and [Ph2⌜PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2](CEt=⌝CPh) (4b). These results inspire a discussion
on the regioselective cycloaddition of 1 with alkynes.
Investigations using 1 with alkene, nitrile, and carbodiimide
molecules were also carried out.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of Amino Group-bridged N-Geminal
P/Al LP
Starting from primary amine 2,6-iPr2C6H3NH2, compound
[Ph2PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2]2 (1) was
prepared through consecutive one-pot synthesis reactions (Scheme 2). Ph2PNH-2,6-iPr2C6H3 was prepared from the reaction of 2,6-iPr2C6H3NH2 with nBuLi
and then PPh2Cl, which was not isolated but used for further
reaction with nBuLi and then AlClEt2.
Compound 1 was isolated as an off-white solid in 78%
yield. A similar method has proven to be useful for synthesizing the
N-geminal P/M (M = Si, Ge, Sn) FLPs reported by our group.12 Using Ph2PNH-2,6-iPr2C6H316 as the precursor, compound 1 was produced in a similar
yield (80%).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of N-Geminal P/Al LP
Compound 1 has been characterized
by 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy
and CHN elemental
analysis. The 31P NMR spectrum exhibits a resonance at
δ 35.76 ppm, which is close to that for complexes Ph2PN(R)AlR′2 (δ 25.0–33.2 ppm).13b The 1H NMR spectrum shows one broad
resonance at δ 0.76 ppm and one triplet resonance at δ
0.95 ppm, assignable to the respective methylene and methyl protons
of the ethyl groups at the Al atom. Furthermore, compound 1 was subjected to X-ray single-crystal diffraction study, which confirmed
its composition and dimeric structure (Figure 1). In the structure of 1, an
Al2N2P2 heterocycle is formed, having
P → Al donor–acceptor bonds. The P–Al bond lengths
are 2.545(1) and 2.563(1) Å, which are longer than those found
in methylene-bridged P/Al LPs (R2PCH2AlMe2)2 (R = Me, tBu) and [ClAl(CH2PMe2)2]2 (2.425(1)–2.5001(5)
Å)14 and also in dialkylaluminum phosphides
[R2AlP(SiMe3)2]2 (R =
Me, Et, iBu; 2.457(2)–2.476(2) Å).17 This suggests a weaker P → Al bonding
in 1, which is probably caused by adaption of a bulky
arylamino bridge.18 The Al2N2P2 heterocycle exhibits a twisted boatlike conformation,
and this conformation differs from the chairlike one for the Al2C2P2 heterocycle found in methylene-bridged
P/Al LPs.14 The N atom of the arylamino
group bonds to the P and Al atoms within a rigid plane (the least
square planes ΔPAlNC(aryl) = 0.0094 and 0.0174 Å).

N(1)–P(1), 1.674(2); P(1)–Al(2), 2.545(1); Al(2)–N(2),

106.19(7); N(2)–Al(2)–P(1), 106.47(7).

At room temperature, one set of either 1H or 31P NMR data was obtained, and at a low temperature
(−50 °C),
this data set did not change. However, the addition of excess tetrahydrofuran
(THF) into a C6D6 solution of 1 led to the formation of a THF coordination compound, Ph2PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2(THF) (δP 49.9 ppm, Figure S1 in the Supporting Information (SI)),
and that of an equivalent amount of N-heterocyclic
carbene produced a similar compound, Ph2PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2[C(NiPrCMe)2] (δP 53.0
ppm; Figure S2). Uhl et al. suggested the
formation of a THF donor coordination compound, tBu2PCH2AlMe2(THF), as well.14b Therefore, when
compared with N-geminal P/M (M = Si, Ge, Sn) FLPs that have a monomeric
nature,12 compound 1 exhibits
increasing Lewis acidic reactivity through the AlEt2 group.

Reactions of 1 with Alkynes
We first carried
out reactions of 1 with internal alkynes. Thus, monitored
by 31P NMR spectroscopy, the reaction with MeC≡CMe
was indicated to occur at 60 °C, giving C2PNAl-heterocyclopentene 2 (δP 31.22 ppm). The reaction with PhC≡CPh
occurred at 80 °C, producing a similar compound, 3 (δP 24.18 ppm) (Scheme 3). Through scaled-up reactions, these two
compounds were obtained with respective isolated yields of 76 and
74%. On using PhC≡CEt instead, the reaction completed at 60
°C, and to our surprise, a mixture of 4a (δP 31.47 ppm) and 4b (δP 23.93
ppm) was obtained, with an approximate molar ratio of 1:1.5 (see Figures S3a,b). This result differs from that
for the reaction of the S/B FLP with PhC≡CnC4H9 to give only [PhSCH2B(C6F5)2](CPh=CnC4H9).8 We repeated
this reaction on an NMR scale or a larger scale and obtained these
two compounds again, with almost no change in their molar ratio. By
fractional crystallization, it was possible to isolate compounds 4a (30%) and 4b (45%) separately.

Scheme 3 Dipolar
Cycloaddition Reactions of 1 with Internal Alkynes
to Zwitterionic C2PNAl-Heterocyclopentenes 2–7
We further chose alkynes PhC≡CCO2Et,
PhC≡CSiMe3, and PhC≡CPPh2 for
the reaction with 1. The former two reactions proceeded
smoothly at room temperature,
whereas the third reaction involved heat treatment at 60 °C.
In all cases, a single product was produced (δP 25.30
ppm for 5, 18.28 ppm for 6, and δP 19.90 ppm for 7 (the resonance at δP 4.2 ppm is assigned to the exocyclic PPh2 group))
with a good isolated yield (77% for 5, 72% for 6, and 76% for 7).

The formation of 2–7 reveals dipolar cycloaddition
of the AlEt2 and PPh2 groups of 1 to the C≡C bond of the alkynes. The generation of 5–7, each as a single product, is considered to
be a result of regioselective cycloaddition. However, that of isomeric 4a and 4b indicates during the cycloaddition
an undergoing of different C≡C bond orientation reactions of
the alkyne towards 1. Essentially, an electronic matching
interaction between 1 and the C≡C bond is crucial
for generating these products. We carried out natural bond orbital
(NBO) analysis of the charge separation of the C≡C bond of
the alkynes involved. The NBO values of α-C and β-C were
calculated to be 0.008 and −0.451 for PhC≡CSiMe3, 0.135 and −0.359 for PhC≡CPPh2,
0.040 and −0.107 for PhC≡CCO2Et, and −0.074
and 0.012 for PhC≡CEt, respectively (Table S3). Large separations of 0.459 and 0.494 are estimated
for the former two alkynes, which suggest strong electronic matching
interactions, giving regioselective 6 and 7. A separation of 0.147 is observed for the third alkyne, and a similar
interaction is favored for the formation of 5. A prior
donor–acceptor interaction between the Al site and CO2Et carbonyl O atom facilitating Al–C(CO2Et) bond
formation would enhance this result. A similar reaction mode has been
observed for a P/B FLP with MeC≡CC(O)Ph to [Mes2PCH2CH2B(C6F5)2][CC(O)Ph=CMe].8 The separation
of 0.086 is for PhC≡CEt, which appears small. This could not
allow regioselective cycloaddition, and then, a mixture of 4a and 4b was indeed produced.

We then chose two
terminal alkynes, Me3SiC≡CH
and EtOC≡CH, for investigation. Still monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy, the reaction of 1 with Me3SiC≡CH proceeded from a low temperature (−50 °C)
to room temperature, giving 8 (δP 17.24
ppm), which was isolated as an off-white solid (70%). The reaction
of 1 with EtOC≡CH completed in the temperature
range from −50 to 10 °C to afford 9 (δP 20.37 ppm), which was isolated as colorless crystals (73%)
(Scheme 4). Both 8 and 9 are single products. The NBO calculations
gave α-C and β-C charge values of −0.487 and −0.187
for Me3SiC≡CH and 0.327 and −0.383 for EtOC≡CH
(Table S3). The significant C≡C
bond charge separations (0.300 for the former and 0.710 for the latter)
allow regioselective formation of 8 and 9 under electronic matching interactions as well.

Scheme 4 Dipolar Cycloaddition
Reactions of 1 with Terminal Alkynes
To Form Zwitterionic C2PNAl-Heterocyclopentenes 8 and 9
Characterization of the Cycloaddition Products
Compounds 2–9 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy
and CHN elemental analysis, among which 2, 4a, 6, and 8 were further authenticated by
X-ray crystallography. The structures of 2, 4a, 6, and 8 are shown in Figures 2–5, with selected bond
lengths and angles. All four of these compounds feature the C2PNAl-heterocyclopentene structure (least square plane Δ:
0.0233 Å for 2, 0.0692 Å for 4a, 0.0678 Å for 6, and 0.0604 [0.0653] Å for 8; C–C bond length: 1.345(3) Å for 2, 1.349(2) Å for 4a, 1.350(3) Å for 6, and 1.348(3) [1.343(3)] Å for 8 (the
value in brackets is for another independent molecule)). In each structure,
both the P and Al atoms are tetracoordinated, adopting a tetrahedral
geometry, and both the P–CC2PNAl and Al–CC2PNAl bonds within each central cycle have a single-bond character.
Thus, these heterocyclopentenes are zwitterionic, with the P atom
at the formal positive charge center and the Al atom at the negative
charge center.

Combining 1H, 13C, 1H-13C HMBC and 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectral
analysis,
the PC= and AlC= carbon
resonances inside the C2PNAl-heterocycles of 2 and 3 and 5 and 6 were assigned.
As seen in Table 1,
the former carbon resonances range from δ 121.4 to 146.1 ppm,
with a 1JPC of 87.2–118.8
Hz. Correspondingly, the latter resonances are found to range from
δ 187.0 to 204.4 ppm, having a 2JPC of 24.4–34.2 Hz. Compounds 4a and 4b are isomeric, but different PC=
and AlC= resonances are displayed (δ
131.0 (1JPC = 110.9 Hz) and
δ 195.7 (2JPC = 35.4
Hz) ppm for 4a and δ 131.3 (1JPC = 118.8 Hz) and δ 200.7 (2JPC = 29.6 Hz) ppm for 4b). In compound 7, because of bonding of another PPh2 group outside the C2PNAl cycle at the AlC=
carbon atom, both the PC= and AlC= carbons exhibit the dd signal, with resonances at δ
138.0 (1JP(inside)C = 108.6
and 2JP(outside)C = 16.1 Hz)
and δ 198.6 (2JP(inside)C = 30.9 and 1JP(outside)C =
51.7 Hz) ppm, respectively. In addition, in the 13C NMR
spectrum of 5, the resonance at δ 173.2 (d, 3JPC = 33.5 Hz, CO) ppm is due to the CO2Et group. In the 29Si NMR spectrum of 6, the SiMe3 resonates at δ −9.10 (d, 3JPSi = 39.7 Hz) ppm.

Similarly, in 8 the PC(H)=
and AlC(SiMe3)= carbon resonances
are at δ 131.4 (1JPC =
103.3 Hz) and δ 209.1 (2JPC = 15.8 Hz) ppm, respectively. The 29Si NMR spectrum shows
a resonance at δ = −5.76 (d, 3JPSi = 43.0 Hz) ppm for the SiMe3 group, and
the 1H NMR spectrum displays a resonance at δ 7.55
(d, 2JPH = 63.6 Hz) ppm, assignable
to the PC(H)= proton. In 9, AlC(H)= and PC(OEt)= resonate
at δ 129.7 (d, 1JPC =
45.6 Hz) and δ 149.8 (d, 1JPC = 161.6 Hz) ppm, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum
indicates that the AlCH= proton resonates
at δ 6.67 (d, 3JPH =
44.2 Hz) ppm and the PC(OEt)= proton resonates
at δ 0.75 (t, 3JHH =
6.6 Hz, CH3) and δ 3.61 (q, 3JHH = 6.6 Hz, CH2) ppm.

Reaction of 1 with Other Unsaturated
Organic Molecules
We further explored the reactions of 1 with alkene,
nitrile, and carbodiimide molecules. The reaction of 1 with α-olefin 4-BrC6H4CH=CH2 proceeded in toluene from −50 °C to room temperature,
giving compound 10 as a colorless crystalline solid,
which was isolated in 70% yield (Scheme 5). Cycloaddition reactions of the (F)LPs
with alkenes were reported rarely.5,9 The highly
selective attack of the Lewis acidic Al atom at the terminal olefinic
carbon atom is in accord with the charge separation of the C=C
bond calculated from the NBO analysis (α-C, −0.200 and
β-C, −0.350; Table S3). The
reactions of 1 with 4-BrC6H4C≡N
and iPrN=C=NiPr each
progressed in toluene at room temperature, and compounds 11 and 12 were readily produced (Scheme 5). Compound 11 was isolated
as a light-yellow solid in 78% yield, and 12, as an off-white
solid in 72% yield. Owing to the well-polarized C≡N and C=N
bond character, regioselective formation of 11 and 12 is expected.

Scheme 5 Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions of 1 with an Alkene,
Nitrile, and Carbodiimide To Form Zwitteric Heterocycles 10–12
X-ray crystallographic study confirms the formation of 10, a C2PNAl-heterocyclopentane (Figure 6). This cycle deviates from
planarity (Δ
= 0.1756 Å), mostly due to formation of the C–C single
bond (1.551(3) Å) inside. The other bond lengths inside this
cycle are comparable to those of C2PNAl-heterocyclopentenes 2, 4a, 6, and 8 (see Table S1). Compounds 11 and 12 both feature a CPN2Al-heterocycle that is planar
or closely planar (Δ = 0.0506 Å for 11 and
0.0638 Å for 12; Figures 7 and 8). Within the
cycle of 11, the C–N bond converts into a double
bond (1.244(4) Å). In the cycle of 12, the C(1)–N(1)
bond is seen to have a length of 1.369(2) Å, which is intermediate
between that of exocyclic N–C2,6-iPr2C6H3 (1.459(2) Å) and N–CiPr (1.459(2) and 1.489(3) Å) single bonds and that of
the C(1)–N(2) double bond (1.279(3) Å). Furthermore, this
C(1)–N(2) bond appears to be a little longer than the C–N
double bond in the CPN2Al-cycle of 11. These
data indicate remaining
electron conjugation over the N=C–N part after cycloaddition.
Compounds 10–12 have also been characterized
by 1H, 13C, 31P, 1H-13C HMBC and 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectroscopy,
which affirmed their structures to be in line with those determined
by X-ray crystallography. It was noted that compound 10 was formed as a mixture of racemic enantiomers (Scheme 5). This can be indicated by
the observance of two sets of 1H and 13C NMR
data (Figures S4–10a and S4–10b).

Conclusions
In
summary, we have prepared an N-geminal P/Al LP, [Ph2PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2]2 (1). Compound 1 exists as
a dimer in the solid state, which can easily form a THF
or N-heterocyclic carbene coordination compound (at
Al atom). Reactions of 1 with a series of alkynes yielded
zwitterionic C2PNAl-heterocyclopentenes [Ph2⌜PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2](CR=⌝CR′) (R, R′ =
Me, Me (2); Ph, Ph (3); Ph, Et (4a); Et, Ph (4b); CO2Et, Ph (5); SiMe3, Ph (6); PPh2, Ph (7); SiMe3, H (8); H, EtO (9)), and reactions of 1 with alkene, nitrile, and carbodiimide
molecules produced zwitteronic C2PNAl-heterocyclopentane
(10) and CPN2Al-heterocycles (11 and 12). When compared with the N-geminal
P/M (M = Si, Ge, Sn) FLPs reported by us,12 an alternation by the AlEt2 group increases the Lewis
acidic reactivity and allows expansion of the reactions of 1 with other alkynes as well as alkene, nitrile, and carbodiimide
molecules. Further study on the reaction of 1 with other
molecules with multiple bonds is in progress.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
All manipulations were carried
out under a dry argon or nitrogen atmosphere using Schlenk line and
glovebox techniques. Solvents toluene, n-hexane,
and tetrahedron were dried by refluxing with sodium–potassium
alloy in the presence of benzophenone under N2 prior to
use. NMR (1H, 13C, 31P, 29Si) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance II 400 MHz spectrometer.
The melting point of the compound was measured in a sealed glass tube
using the Büchi-540 instrument. Elemental analysis was performed
on a Thermo Quest Italia SPA EA 1110 instrument. Commercially available
reagents were purchased from Aldrich, Acros, or Alfa-Aesar Chemical
Co. and used as received. Compounds Ph2PNH(2,6-iPr2C6H3)16 and PhC≡CPPh219 were prepared according to the literature.

Synthesis of [Ph2PN(2,6-iPr2C6H3)AlEt2]2 (1)
Method A
(starting from 2,6-iPr2C6H3NH2): At −78
°C, nBuLi (4.2 mL of a 2.4 M n-hexane
solution, 10 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of 2,6-iPr2C6H3NH2 (1.77
g, 10 mmol) in diethyl ether (60 mL). The mixture was left to warm
to room temperature with continuous stirring, during which the lithium
salt 2,6-iPr2C6H3NHLi was formed. This solution was cooled again to −78 °C,
and to it, neat Ph2PCl (1.80 mL, 10 mmol) was added. The
mixture was left to warm to room temperature and stirred for 12 h,
giving Ph2PNH(2,6-iPr2C6H3). Compound Ph2PNH(2,6-iPr2C6H3) was not isolated but was
used for further reaction. Thus, the Ph2PNH(2,6-iPr2C6H3)-containing mixture
was cooled again to −78 °C, and to it, nBuLi (4.2 mL of a 2.4 M n-hexane solution, 10 mmol)
was added dropwise. The mixture was left to warm to room temperature,
giving lithium salt 2,6-iPr2C6H3N(PPh2)Li. Then, the mixture was cooled again
to −78 °C, followed by the addition of neat AlClEt2 (5 mL of a 2 M n-hexane solution, 10 mmol);
the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for a further
12 h. All of the insoluble LiCl was filtered off, and the filtrate
was dried under reduced pressure to give a solid residue. The n-hexane (10 mL) extract of this residue was kept at −20
°C for 1 day, giving an off-white solid of 1, which
was collected by filtration. Yield: 3.48 g, 78%. Method B (starting
from Ph2PNH(2,6-iPr2C6H3)): At −78 °C, nBuLi (2.5
mL of a 2.4 M n-hexane solution, 6 mmol) was added
dropwise to a solution of Ph2PNH(2,6-iPr2C6H3) (2.17 g, 6 mmol) in toluene
(40 mL). The mixture was left to warm to room temperature with continuous
stirring, giving lithium salt 2,6-iPr2C6H3N(PPh2)Li. The mixture was cooled
again to −78 °C, and to it, AlClEt2 (3 mL of
a 2 M n-hexane solution, 6 mmol) was added. The mixture
was left to warm to room temperature and stirred for a further 12
h. The insoluble LiCl was filtered off. The filtrate was evaporated
to dryness to give an off-white solid of 1, which was
collected and washed with cooled n-hexane (−20
°C, 2 mL). Yield: 2.14 g, 80%; mp: 134 °C. 1H

mmol) was added to a suspension of 1 (0. 218 g, 0.245
mmol) in toluene (10 mL) under stirring. Within 3 min a clear solution
was formed. After stirring for a further 5 min, the toluene solvent
was removed and the residue was extracted with n-hexane
(5 mL). The extract was kept at −20 °C for 1 day, giving

X-ray Crystallographic
Analysis
Crystallographic data
for 1, 2, 4a·C6D6, 6·1.5C6D6, 8, 10·toluene, 11, and 12·C6D6 were collected on an Oxford
Gemini S Ultra system. During measurements, graphite monochromatic
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) was used for 1, 2, 4a·C6D6, 6·1.5C6D6, 8, and 12·C6D6, whereas
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) was used for 10·toluene and 11. Absorption corrections
were applied using the spherical harmonics program (multiscan type).
All structures were solved by direct methods (SHELXS-96)20 and refined against F2 using SHELXL-97.21 In general, the nonhydrogen
atoms were located by difference Fourier synthesis and refined anisotropically
and the hydrogen atoms were included using a riding model, with Uiso tied to the Uiso of the parent atoms. In 2, one Et group at the Al atom
was disordered and treated by the PART splitting mode method. The
final refinement gave 51.9% occupation of the C(5)- and C(6)-containing
groups, whereas 48.1% occupation of the C(5A)- and C(6A)-containing
groups was obtained. Because of this disorder, the ADP max/min ratio
of 4.6 appears a little larger, giving a B-level alert. In 6·1.5C6D6, two Et groups at the Al atom
were disordered and treated by the PART method (C(12)C(13) 50.4% and
C(12A)C(13A) 49.6% and C(14)C(15) 33.0% and C(14A)C(15A) 67.0%). One
C6D6 molecule was also observed to be disordered,
which was treated by the PART method (C(41)C(42)C(43)C(44)C(45)C(46)
45.2% and C(41A)C(42A)C(43A)C(44A)C(45A)C(46A) 54.8%). In 8, two independent molecules were disclosed. In one molecule, two
Et groups at the Al atom were disordered and treated by the PART method
(C(6)C(7) 36.6% and C(6A)C(7A) 63.4% and C(8)C(9) 7.5% and C(8A)C(9A)
92.5%). In this case, one Et group of another independent molecule
showed a B-level alert by a Hirshfeld test difference of 7.3 for C(36)···C(37).
However, the C(36)–C(37) bond length of 1.520(2) Å is
suitable. Therefore, this alert should be ignored. In 12·C6D6, one Et group at the Al atom was
disordered and treated by the PART method (C(8)C(9) 60.2% and C(8A)C(9A)
39.8%). One C6D6 molecule was found to be disordered
as well, which was treated by the PART method (C(31)C(32)C(33)C(34)C(35)C(36)
54.1% and C(31A)C(32A)C(33A)C(34A)C(35A)C(36A) 45.9%). In compounds 10 and 11, the calculated sin θmax/wavelength of 0.5735 is minutely less than 0.575, and these
B-level alerts can be ignored. A summary of cell parameters, data
collection, and structure solution and refinements is given in Table S1.

A number of the trisubstituted
aluminum–phosphine
adduct compounds have been reported, in which varied P–Al bond
lengths of 2.451(1)–2.585(2) Å were recorded mostly due
to the steric influence of the substituents at the Al and/or P atoms
