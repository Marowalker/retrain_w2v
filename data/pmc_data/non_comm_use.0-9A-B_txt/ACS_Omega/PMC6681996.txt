In the present investigation,
crab shells as seafood wastes were
successfully recycled into an extremely useful biomaterial by the
thermal treatment method. Thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis
studies concluded that the calcination temperature must be beyond
∼570 °C to get a fine and crystalline apatite powder from
the crab shells. Thus, the calcination temperature is taken to be
700 °C. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis of the calcined crab
shells revealed hydroxyapatite (HAp)/carbonated HAp (CHAp) with an
average crystallite size of 24.4 nm. Scanning electron microscopy
revealed the surface morphology of the crab shells-derived apatite
powder as needle-like nanorods of HAp of diameter ≈ 100–300
nm and nanospheres of CHAp of diameter ≈ 100–500. Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy showed the presence of calcium, phosphorous, magnesium,
and oxygen as major elements in the apatite constituents. Fourier
transform infrared as well as Raman spectroscopies confirmed the formation
of apatite powder. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicated
the electronic environment and oxidation states of the constituent
elements, Ca, C, and P. On the basis of the results obtained from
various characterization techniques, the overall study emphasized
an environment-friendly and cost-effective approach for recycling
of the bio-pollutant and synthesis of ultra-fine, ultra-crystalline
apatite-based excellent biomaterial derived from crab shells as seafood
wastes with its application as a futuristic biomaterial in bone/teeth
implants.

Introduction
Seafood processing produces a very large
quantity of solid and
liquid wastes. There is a large demand of an effective strategy for
the utilization  that can minimize the environmental pollution
by recovering the products of commercial interest from the industry
waste obtained during seafood processing. Biomaterials derived from
biological wastes (taken as resources) are generally abundant, renewable,
inexpensive, and environment-friendly as compared to artificial biomaterials
synthesized chemically. Seafood and other value-added goods obtained
during processing have a marketable demand. In the past 20 years,
the business in this area have grown to become a billion-dollar industry.1 The rising demand of such products has resulted
in the growth of fishing and aquaculture business across the world.
The highly consumable seafood, needs to be processed to extend its
shelf-life. Similar to most of the food industries, fish processing
also produces waste (fish carcasses, viscera, skin, and heads). If
45% of the live weight is considered as waste material, then nearly
63.6 million metric tons of waste would be generated globally.2 Therefore, aquaculture and the food-processing
industries produce a huge quantity of waste globally each year. Hence,
solid wastes generated on a huge scale by the seafood industries and
its removal has become a horrific trouble nowadays. An attractive
management of such waste produced from seafood processing is urgently
required because it is a major cause for the environmental problems
associated with discarding it in the ocean, dumping on the land, which
again raise problems related to unnecessary nutrient inputs.3 It is noteworthy to mention that the disposal
of seafood waste is very costly due to firm environmental regulations.4 Therefore in current situation one of the instant
solutions for this issue is to utilize/recycle the waste materials
in such such a way that it can be cost-effectively and resourcefully
used to produce other useful materials and products which may additionally
resolve some financial problems of purchasing of costly materials.5

Crab shells are the most common and chief
waste produced by the
seafood industry. Many successful methods were adopted for the utilization
of crab shells in different applications such as a source of chitin,
metal removal from aqueous solutions, and in drug delivery systems.6−9 A novel and potential application of crab shells as seafood waste
is strongly anticipated in the production of some extremely important
calcium phosphate biomaterials/apatite/hydroxyapatite (HAp)/carbonated
HAp (CHAp) powders similar to the production of apatite powders from
bovine, sheep and goat, skeletons, as crab shells also mainly contain
the carbonates of calcium and magnesium.10 HAp, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, is chemically similar to the mineral component of mammalians bones,
and hence has the ability to interact with bones.10 Therefore, research on HAp has been progressing exponentially
to seek the possibilities of use of HAp as a bone replacement material.10 Concurrently, researchers are also using various
procedures for the improvement of mechanical, biocompatibility, and
electrical properties of thus-prepared biological HAp.11,12 HAp promotes bone ingrowths when used in orthopedic, prosthetic,
and dental implant applications.13 HAp
with stoichiometric composition and Ca/P(ratio) = 1.67 has generated
much awareness in the context of bone and teeth implants due to its
resemblance with the mineral constituent of mammalian bones and teeth.
Conversely, HAp may be produced from mammalian bones. By using this
idea worldwide, a large number of industries are working for apatite
products from biological resources, particularly from bovine bones
supplied from slaughterhouse/meat packaging industries. Therefore,
the research on seeking different possibilities and methods of recycling
the waste material/bio-pollutants into useful product(s) is quite
necessary because these methods will, on one hand, minimize the danger
of diseases rising due to air and water pollution caused by dumping
of wastes and prevent polluting the environment and fouling the earth.
Moreover, the recycling of the seafood waste/bio-pollutants may offer
industry-level production of extremely important materials/biomaterials,
on the other hand. However, somehow, recycling of crab shells could
not be yet attempted unlike the recycling of skeletons of bovine and
other mammals. The main reason behind this was the lack of proper
information about the structure and biological behavior of the thermally
processed powder of crab shells. Therefore, utilization of the processed
powder could not be determined. This motivated us to investigate the
structure and biological behavior of thermally processed crab shell
powders to establish the recycling of crab shell-like seafood waste
into a biomaterial, which may have extreme potential as a xenograft
material and that will consequently promote-cum-offer the production
of biomaterials from crab shells on an industrial level. Therefore,
comprehensive investigations on structural analysis, in vitro cytotoxicity,
and bone-forming efficacy of the crab shell-derived apatite powder
are urgently required. The present work provides the demonstrated
solid model to save the environment and the planet we live on. Our
study creates a paradigm for future studies, specifically in vitro
and in vivo applications.

The heat treatment method of extracting
HAp from crab shells is
adopted in the present investigation because it is a simple, economical,
quick, and appropriate approach. It involves a solid-state reaction
route and does not involve the presence of impurities, which appear
because of the use of solvents, acids, microbes, and so forth. In
addition to this, the solid-state reaction route is the most widely
used method for the preparation of polycrystalline nano-HAp from biological
resources.14 Solids do not react together
at room temperature and a much higher temperature is required for
that. During the heat treatment of biological samples, there is combustion
of organic substances contained in the form of proteins and collagens
get volatilized and removed.15 In the present
investigation, half-boiled crab shells were washed and dried, and
thereafter, the dried sample was subjected to thermal treatment. The
thus-obtained calcined powder of crab shells was further characterized
to determine the crystal structure, microstructure, and molecular
structure, of the calcined powder of crab shells to determine its
possible application as a futuristic biomaterial in bone/teeth implants,
tissue engineering, and drug delivery.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
Half-boiled crab shells treated
as waste were collected from the fishermen residing in areas of the
Puri sea beach, Odisha, India. The crab shells as obtained in the
original form were thoroughly washed with triply distilled water and
were dried in an oven at 200 °C for 5 h. The dried crab shells
were crushed to form crab shell powder by using mortar and pestle.
The crab shell powder was then characterized by thermogravimetric-differential
thermal analysis (TG-DTA) to determine the calcination temperature
and then calcined in an alumina crucible at 700 °C for 3 h at
a heating rate of 5 °C min–1.

Characterization
The thermal behavior of the dried
and crushed crab shells is analyzed employing thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) and DTA by using a TG-DTA model no. Labsys 16, Setaram by heating
the samples up to 600 °C in air at the heating rate of 10 °C
min–1. The dried and crushed crab shells were calcined
at 700 °C in air at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 for 3 h. The calcined sample is characterized for the determination
of crystal structure and phase constitution using X-ray diffraction
(XRD) by using a Rigaku Desktop Miniflex II X-ray diffractometer,
Tokyo, Japan, equipped with Cu Kα radiation as the source of
X-ray and a nickel filter. The molecular structure of the sample is
analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy by using
a PerkinElmer spectrum 65, FTIR spectrometer, MA using KBr pellet
with the calcined sample in the ratio KBr/sample: 1:10. The calcined
sample is also studied by Raman spectroscopy to investigate the nature
of chemical functional groups present in it using a micro-Raman setup,
Renishaw (Gloucestershire, UK) having grating of 1800 lines mm–1 and a Peltier cooled CCD. A microscope from Olympus,
model number MX50A/T, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany is attached to the
spectrometer to focus the laser light onto the sample and collect
the scattered light at 180° scattering geometry. The 514.5 nm
line of Ar+ laser is used as the excitation source, and
the GRAM-32 (Adent Scientific plc., Hertfordshire, UK) software is
used for data collection. The microstructure of the calcined sample
is studied by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on applying
an extra high tension of 20 kV to the metal-coated powder samples
using Inspect S-50, FEI Company of USA (SEA) PTE Ltd., Singapore,
FP 2017/12 scanning electron microscope. Eenergy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) of the calcined sample is also performed to analyze
the elements present in the calcined sample. In order to study the
electronic environment and chemical oxidation states of the elements
present in the samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is
carried out using Amicus, Kratos Analytical (Shimadzu), Spectroscope.
The binding energy in XPS analysis is corrected by the C (1s) adventitious
peak.

Results and Discussion
Thermal Analysis
The thermal behavior
of the dried
and crushed crab shells is studied by heating the sample from room
temperature up to 600 °C by using TG-DTA (Figure 1). The TGA curve is divided into segments
depending on the temperature range; room temperature −400,
400–470, and 470–600 °C. Initially, in the first
segment (room temperature −400 °C), a weight gain of ∼3%
of total weight is observed that may be attributed to the presence
of something in the system which is oxidizing and resulting in the
gain in mass. In the second segment (400–470 °C), the
sample exhibited the total weight loss of ∼7% of initial weight
as followed by an endothermic peak-cum-envelope at ∼460 °C
in the DTA curve, which clearly indicates the removal of absorbed
water, organic ingredients (collagen) of crab shells, and other biological
compounds. This DTA peak is observed to be wide like an envelope rather
than a sharp one showing regular heat flow (i.e., continuous endothermic
nature) from the very beginning (room temperature −400 °C)
because of the presence of absorbed water and other biological compounds;
however, the second segment of this envelope (400–460 °C)
was comparatively sharper than the previous and is attributed to the
presence of CHAp and other minerals in crab shells as biological apatite
contains type-B CHAp. In the third segment (470–600 °C),
no significant weight loss is observed; however, the DTA curve shows
an exothermic peak at ∼480 °C that may be due to the formation
of biological HAp nodules. However, crystallization temperature of
type-B CHAp may be different, hopefully more than the crystallization
temperature of HAp and could be obtained by heating this sample up
to 1000 °C. TG-DTA studies finally gave the idea of the calcination
temperature to which the crab shell powder must be heated for the
formation of the apatite nodules as a true biomaterial. The calcination
temperature for crab shell powder is therefore taken as 700 °C
for the sample in bulk amount. This temperature should be enough to
remove the organic part of the crab shells/bones present in the form
of extra cellular matrix containing collagen fibers.

Figure 1 TG-DTA of the dried crab
shells before heat treatment (calcinations).
The havoc weight loss is due to the removal of the organic part, that
is, collagen from the crab shells and formation of apatite nodules.

Crystal Structure
The crystal structure of the calcined
sample is studied by using XRD as given in Figure 2 and a careful comparison of the XRD pattern
with the JCPDS (file no. 24-0033) for hexagonal HAp indicated that
all of the diffraction peaks of the sample are in good agreement with
the standard data for HAp and CHAp. All high intensity peaks in the
XRD pattern revealed that the HAp appeared in major form in the calcined
crab shells. However, three peaks due to planes *(210) at 29°,
*(302) at 43°, and *(132) at 47° revealed the presence of
CHAp (Ca10(PO4)3(CO3)3(OH)2) with JCPDS file no. 19-0272 in the crab
skeleton, which is the characteristic part of the biological apatite.
On refinement using Unit Cell Software,16 it was observed that the lattice parameters and volume of the calcined
crab shells were in close agreement with that of HAp and CHAp as given
in Table 1. The average
crystallite size of the calcined crab shells is calculated using the
Scherer’s formula which is given by 1  where D is the crystallite
size, λ is the wavelength which is equal to 1.5406 Å, β
is the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) in radians, and θ is
the diffracted angle. The average crystallite size is found to be
24.4 nm. The fine and sharp peaks observed in the XRD pattern also
suggest high crystallinity of the calcined crab shells.

Figure 2 XRD pattern
of crab shells powder calcined at 700 °C for 3
h. XRD revealed that the calcined crab shells powder is nothing but
a specific mixture of HAp and CHAp as the characteristic parts of
the biological apatite.

Microstructure
Analysis
The SEM image of the crab shells
calcined at 700 °C is shown in Figure 3. The SEM image is taken at magnification
of 20 000×. The overall morphology clearly indicates that
some rod-like nanostructures with diameter around 100–300 nm
and length around 600 nm are present. SEM results revealed that nanorods
of HAp are present in the skeletons of crabs (phylum: euarthropoda,
class: malacostraca), mammals, few birds, and other sea animals. Most
of the birds and reptiles are to be investigated in the aspect of
the morphology/histology of their skeletons. Hexagonal HAp has an
intrinsic (002) face preference for growth, which always facilitates
the formation of rods rather than particles.17

Figure 3 SEM
image of calcined crab shells. Image shows that the biological
apatite derived from crabs have nanorods of HAp of dimensions ∼200
nm × 600 nm along with the carbonated (HAp). Yellow-colored arrows
indicate the nanorods of well crystallized Hap; however, red-colored
arrows show the crystallized nanospheres as well as semicrystallized
undeveloped grains of CHAp. Complete crystallization of CHAp needs
comparatively slow heating rate and more holding time for calcination
as compared to pure HAp.

distribution on the surface of the calcined crab shells sample. EDS
of the calcined sample indicates the presence of calcium, magnesium,
chlorine, oxygen, and phosphorous with atomic % of 30.18, 2.44, 1.85,
55.94, and 9.59, respectively. Calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, and
oxygen were distributed in higher amounts as compared to chlorine.
Conversely, it is observed that chlorine is very less dense and pertains
to the surface only as compared to calcium, phosphorous, magnesium,
and oxygen.

The EDS indicated the presence of calcium, magnesium, chlorine, oxygen,
and phosphorous with atomic % of 30.18, 2.44, 1.85, 55.94, and 9.59,
respectively. Calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, and oxygen are distributed
in more amounts as compared to chlorine. Conversely, chlorine is very
less dense and pertains to the surface only.

Molecular Structure
Figure 5 depicts the FTIR and Raman spectrum of the
calcined crab shells sample. Both the spectra were recorded in the
wavenumber range 4000–400 cm–1. All absorption
peaks in the FTIR spectrum and scattering peaks in the Raman spectrum
along with their assignments are enlisted in Table 2. A careful examination of the FTIR spectrum
of the calcined powder reveals that all observed bands may be attributed
to one or the other vibrational mode of pure HAp. It is totally pertinent
to note herein that totally symmetric modes have a higher intensity
in the Raman spectrum, whereas the corresponding IR bands have lower
intensity for symmetric modes in IR. Reverse is the case for asymmetrical
modes in IR and the Raman spectrum. The lowest wavenumber peak in
IR is observed at 563 cm–1 which is due to the ν4 bending mode of O–P–O. Also, the peak at 771
cm–1 is due to the Ca(OH)2 vibration
band. The presence of carbonate ions (CO32–) is indicated by the peak at 875 cm–1. The ν1-symmetric stretching mode of PO43– is obtained at 962 cm–1.18 Absorption peaks at wavenumber 1047, 1091, and 1119 cm–1 in the IR spectrum represent the ν3 P–O
asymmetric stretching modes of the orthophosphate groups of the calcined
sample.18 The corresponding band in the
Raman spectrum appears at 1085 cm–1. A high intensity
absorption band centered at 1457 cm–1 is attributed
to the ν3-mode of carbonate ions (CO32–) of type-B CHAp. Three absorption peaks appear at
1796, 1994, and 2517 cm–1 and are attributed to
the stretching vibrations of carbonate ions (CO32–) in the IR region. A medium intensity sharp peak at 3644 cm–1 depicts the stretching modes of OH–. The similar band in the Raman profile appears at 3613 cm–1. This may be due to the presence of hydrogen-bonded H2O (see Table 2). Spectroscopic
characterizations confirm the presence of HAp/CHAp in the calcined
crab shells.

and Raman

jointly convinced that calcined crab shells are nothing but HAp/CHAp.

XPS of Calcined Crab Shells
XPS analysis is also performed
to confirm the presence of constituting elements in the calcined crab
shells powder. Existence of an element is detected by the binding
energy associated with a particular electronic state of that element.
The electronic environment and oxidation states of the elements contained
in the calcined crab shells studied using XPS are shown in Figure 6a–d illustrating
the XPS profiles of the high-resolution spectra of specific constituent
elements of the calcined crab shells sample as (a) full spectrum,
(b) calcium element, (c) carbon element, and (d) phosphorous element.
The binding energy in the XPS analysis is corrected by the C (1s)
adventitious peak. Figure 6a exhibits that calcined crab shells are mainly composed of
Ca, C, P, and O. The peak observed at 286 eV is because of C 1s due
to the adventitious hydrocarbon from the XPS instrument. The Ca 2p1/2 and Ca 2p3/2 are found to be located at binding
energies of 352 and 348 eV, occupying areas of 3911 and 9134, having
fwhm of 1.870 and 2.057 eV, respectively (see Figure 6b). The C is found to be located at two different
regions, one indicating C bonded to the carbonate (CO32–) group and another due to C 1s peak of binding energies
of 291 and 286 eV, respectively (see Figure 6c). The 2p3/2 at 133.5 eV and
2p1/2 at 134.8 eV indicate the phosphate bonding with calcium
in the calcined sample. Like the previous characterization techniques,
XPS also confirms the presence of HAp/CHAp in the calcined crab shells.

Figure 6 XPS profiles
of calcined sample as (a) full spectrum, (b) calcium,
(c) carbon, and (d) phosphorous elements.

The above results obtained from different structural, morphological,
spectroscopic, chemical, and biological characterization techniques
clearly convince that the obtained biological material is the apatite
powder of nanostructured HAp/CHAp derived from crab shells. Recent
advancements in ceramic fabrication have offered bone reconstruction
by choosing a suitable combination of these materials.18,19 This method does not require any additional chemicals for the source
of calcium, source of phosphorous, capping agent, pH maintaining chemical,
such as phosphoric acid or sulfuric compounds, EDTA or CTAB, sodium
hydroxide pellets, and so forth that makes its advantages stronger
on the environmental benefits and minimizes the cost of the product.
Thus, it is worthwhile to state that the employed synthesis method
is a very cost-effective and environment-friendly approach for recycling
of seafood waste into such an amazing useful apatite nanobiomaterial.

Conclusions
Apatite NPs of the average crystallite size
24.4 nm and particle
size 100–300 nm are successfully derived from crab shells.
The obtained powder is the mixture of needle-like nanorods of HAp
and nanospheres of CHAp NPs similar to apatite powder derived from
other biological sources such as bovine, sheep, human and so forth.
The overall study concludes that the present method is an environment-friendly
and cost-effective approach to derive apatite powder from crab shells,
that has potential applications in bone implants, scaffolds, dentistry,
bone cements, tissue engineering, and drug delivery. The crab shells-derived
apatite powder is strongly expected to be highly compatible with osteoblast
cells and to have osteogenic behavior as it is the mixture of HAp
and CHAp.
