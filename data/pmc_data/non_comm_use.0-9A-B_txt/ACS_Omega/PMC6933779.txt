The sulfonated magnetic SiO2 microsphere solid
acid
catalysts were prepared by the impregnation and grafting methods with
iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs)
as the magnetic cores. The catalytic properties of the magnetic SiO2 solid acid catalyst were studied in detail. The characterization
results showed that the SiO2 was successfully coated on
the Fe3O4 MNPs. Compared with the grafting method,
impregnated solid acid exhibits higher catalytic performance, which
reached an esterification rate of up to 99.00% when the reaction temperature
was 105 °C, the molar ratio of n-butanol/adipic
acid was 3:1, and the ratio of the catalyst (the mass of magnetic
solid acid) to liquids (the total volume of n-butanol
and adipic acid) was 2.95%. The magnetic solid acid exhibited great
separation ability and reusability. After six times of recycle, the
conversion of the grafted magnetic solid acid still attained 85.61%
compared with that of the impregnated magnetic solid acid, which reduced
to 81.35%, holding great potential for green chemical processes.

Introduction
The liquid acid catalyst is by far the
greatly important area of
catalysis in all sectors of chemical manufacturing1−3 due to its mild
reaction conditions and simple processes. However, with the advancement
of science and technology, people’s awareness of environmental
protection has gradually improved, finding that the high toxicity
and corrosive properties from liquid acid lead to a huge waste of
energy and production of large amounts of waste products,4 which make it no longer adapt to the development
of green chemistry. Recently, solid acid that is nontoxic,5 noncorrosive,6 high
activity,7 and stable8 has attracted great interest among researchers, which make
it possible to replace the liquid acids.9,10 Consequently,
lots of experiments have been introduced for generating a variety
of solid acid catalysts such as based on Ps-AlCl3,11 SO42–/SnO2,12 Sn-MFI,13 and clay,14 which have been widely used
in many fields such as chemical synthesis, biomass conversion, adsorption,
catalysis, and so forth. Moreno et al.12 synthesized the SO42–/SnO2 solid acid catalyst for catalyzing the production of biodiesel from
oleic acid and methanol. The characterization results showed that
the SO42–/SnO2 catalyst had
a high specific surface area (87 m2/g), which enhanced
its catalytic activity. However, the conventional supported solid
acid catalysts were usually recovered by centrifugation or physical
sedimentation, resulting in a low yield and failing to meet the needs
of industrial continuous production. Compared with these catalysts,
magnetic solid acids can be easily separated in the presence of an
external magnetic field, particularly in viscous reaction solution.15 Recently, a series of magnetic solid acids were
synthesized by the sulfonation method with various shell materials.16−18 However, many of the reported magnetic solid acids are unsatisfactory
in acid-catalyzed reactions.15,19

One way to overcome
this problem of the magnetic solid catalyst
is to use relatively stable SiO2 nanoparticle as the carrier,
which can protect the iron oxide magnetic core in the presence of
the acidic solution. In this type of magnetic SiO2 solid
acid, the reactive centers are highly mobile, similar to the nonmagnetic
catalyst, and at the same time, it has the advantage of recyclability.20 Generally, impregnation and grafting methods
are often used for the solid acid preparation. For the former, the
solid acid has a good catalytic effect, high utilization rate, and
low cost, while for the latter, the acid radical is connected to the
surface of the silicon-based material in the form of a covalent bond,
which makes the acidic group more stable.21−23 Both impregnation
and grafting are effective methods for improving the catalytic activity
in which solid acid’s high recyclability can be represented.

In this paper, iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) were prepared by the hydrothermal method, and
then the magnetic SiO2 was prepared by using the former
Fe3O4 as the magnetic core. The magnetic SiO2 was used as the carrier to prepare the sulfonated magnetic
SiO2 solid acid by impregnation and grafting methods. The
catalytic activity of the magnetic SiO2 solid acid was
investigated by the esterification of acetic acid and ethanol. The
catalytic effect and cyclic stability of the impregnation and grafting
modification methods were also compared, aiming to achieve the high
activity and recyclability of magnetic solid acids by comparing to
the previously reported nonmagnetic solid catalysts.

Results and Discussion
Morphological Analysis
The SEM and TEM images of Fe3O4 MNPs and magnetic SiO2 samples are
shown in Figure 1.
Spherical Fe3O4 with uniform particle size and
uniform distribution can be seen in Figure 1. It could be inferred that the Fe3O4 microspheres were composed of finer microspheres from
the fine particles on the spherical surface. Compared with Fe3O4 microspheres, the magnetic SiO2 particles
exhibited a smooth surface, and the outer surface was coated with
the SiO2 microspheres.

Figure 1 SEM and TEM images of (a,c) Fe3O4 and (b,d)
magnetic SiO2.

Continuously reunited and growing Fe3O4 grains
can be seen in Figure 1c, which formed the big nanoparticles on the Fe3O4 surface. At the same time, it can be clearly seen from Figure 1d that the SiO2 particles were coated on the Fe3O4 particles.
Additionally, the SiO2 particles were uniformly distributed,
which made the surface of the magnetic SiO2 particles relatively
smooth.

X-ray Diffraction
The XRD patterns of all as-prepared
samples are shown in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, the characteristic peaks of Fe3O4 at
2θ = 18.5, 30.1, 35.5, 37.2, 43.2, 53.7, 57.1, 62.7, and 74.1°
can be indexed as the diffractions of (111), (220), (311), (222),
(400), (422), (511), (440), and (533), respectively, which are almost
consistent with the diffraction peaks of the PDF standard powder diffraction
card Fe3O4 (JCPDS 79-0419), indicating that
the phase structure of Fe3O4 was the inverse
spinel structure. Moreover, no obvious impurity peaks in the XRD pattern
confirmed that the Fe3O4 showed a higher purity.
It was interesting that the average size of Fe3O4 was calculated to be 17.9 nm,24 which
inferred that Fe3O4 microspheres were composed
of nanosized particles.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of (a) Fe3O4, (b) magnetic SiO2, (c) impregnated solid acid, and (d)
grafted solid acid.

Comparative analysis found that magnetic SiO2 and sulfonated
magnetic SiO2 solid acid showed a broad diffraction peak
at 2θ = 23° besides the characteristic diffraction peak
of Fe3O4, which belongs to the characteristic
peaks of the amorphous structure of SiO2, indicating that
SiO2 was successfully coated on the Fe3O4 MNPs. Meanwhile, it can be seen from the XRD pattern of the
solid acid that the intensity of the diffraction peak of Fe3O4 in the impregnated solid acid was slightly weakened,
which indicated that Fe3O4 may be reacted during
the sulfonation process, resulting in the relatively lower content.

Magnetic Analysis
The hysteresis loops of all samples
are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen, all of the samples showed no hysteresis loops,
and the coercive force was almost zero, indicating that they were
superparamagnetic, which was consistent with the previous conclusions
of XRD analysis. Compared with the high saturation magnetization (67.02
emu/g) of Fe3O4, the saturation magnetization
(15.36 emu/g) of magnetic SiO2 was greatly reduced, which
was caused by the thick layer of SiO2 wrapped on the surface
of Fe3O4. The saturation magnetization of the
impregnated magnetic SiO2 solid acid was 19.06 emu/g, slightly
higher than that of the magnetic SiO2, which may be caused
by a slight drop of the SiO2 shell during the sulfonation
process.

Figure 3 Hysteresis loops of (a) magnetic SiO2, (b) impregnated
solid acid, (c) grafted solid acid, and (d) Fe3O4.

Besides, the grafted magnetic SiO2 solid
acid exhibited
a saturation magnetization of 37.83 emu/g, which was stronger than
the saturation magnetization of the impregnated magnetic SiO2 solid acid. This was caused by the apparent shedding of the SiO2 shell on the surface of Fe3O4 during
the grafting process, resulting in an increase in the relative content
of Fe3O4.

Figure 4 shows the
magnetic separation ability of the magnetic solid acid. It was found
that the magnetic solid acid exhibited good separation ability regardless
whether it was impregnated or grafted, which provided a strong basis
for its high recyclability in the green industry.

magnetic SiO2 solid acids: (a)
impregnation and (b) grafting

FT-IR Spectra
The FT-IR spectra of all samples are
shown in Figure 5.
As shown in Figure 5, the broad bands at 3450 and 1640 cm–1 were attributed
to the stretching vibration peaks and bending vibration peaks of O–H,25 respectively. The characteristic band observed
in the FT-IR spectrum of Fe–O–Fe at 580 cm–1 was ascribed to the fundamental vibrational modes of Fe3O4. The characteristic bands around 470 and 953 cm–1 were the vibrational band of the Si–O–Si
bond and Si–OH bond, respectively, indicating that the outer
surface of Fe3O4 was coated with SiO2, which was caused by the large amount of hydroxyl groups on the
surface of the silicon shell of Fe3O4. Furthermore,
the band of 650 cm–1 in the solid acid was assigned
to the S–O stretching vibration, showing that −SO3H were immobilized onto the surface of the magnetic SiO2 after acid modification, which can also be confirmed by the
initial acidity of the impregnated magnetic solid acid being 4.127
mmol/L and that of the grafted ones being 1.584 mmol/L.

Catalytic Activity and Cyclic Stability
The effects
of reaction temperature, molar ratio of n-butanol/adipic
acid, and catalyst (the mass of magnetic solid acid)/liquids (the
total volume of n-butanol and adipic acid) on the
esterification reaction are shown in Figure 6. It was found that different reaction factors
showed a great influence on the esterification reaction. Figure 7 shows the conversion
of grafted solid acid and impregnated solid acid as catalysts in six
cycles.

Figure 6 Effects of different conditions on esterification reaction of solid
acid: (a) impregnation and (b) grafting.

Figure 7 Effects of catalyst cycle times on conversion.

As shown in Figure 6, in the initial 0.5 h of the reaction, the esterification
rate increased
significantly with the increase of reaction time. As the reaction
time prolonged, the esterification rate gradually increased to a steady
state at a slower rate. This was because the reactants established
a contact equilibrium with the catalyst during the reaction progress,
achieving a higher esterification rate. While the reaction continued,
this led to adsorption or even side effects of the product on the
catalyst surface, inhibiting the progress of the esterification reaction.

The molar ratio had a significant effect on the esterification
of solid acid compared with other factors in this paper. As shown
from Figure 6II, the
esterification rate of solid acid in this paper first increased then
gradually became flat, with the increase of the molar ratio of n-butanol/adipic acid. The amount of n-butanol
was less as the molar ratio was low, resulting in a lower conversion
rate. As the molar ratio increases, the amount of n-butanol increased correspondingly, which was beneficial to the positive
movement of the esterification reaction, and thus, the conversion
rate was increased; however, the reaction reached equilibrium as there
was an excessive increase of the molar ratio, resulting in a constant
conversion rate and flat reaction curve.

Compared with the optimal
reaction conditions (Figure 6) and cyclic stability (Figure 7) of two different
magnetic solid acids, it can be found that the highest esterification
rate of the grafted magnetic solid acid was 89.12%, while the esterification
rate of the impregnation magnetic solid acid was up to 99.00% when
the reaction temperature was 105 °C, the molar ratio of n-butanol/adipic acid was 3:1, and the ratio of the catalyst
/liquids was 2.95%, which was increased by 11.09%, indicating that
the catalytic activity of the impregnated magnetic solid acid was
higher than that of the grafted magnetic solid acid. It also can be
seen that the impregnated magnetic solid acid decreased remarkably
with the increase in the cycle times, and the conversion decreased
to 81.35% after six cycle times, which can be attributed to the leaching
of the −SO3H absorbed on the outer surface during
the reaction. It was confirmed by acidity detection of the impregnated
catalyst after six cycle times, which showed that the amount of acid
was greatly reduced from 4.127 to 1.856 mmol/g, which reduced by 55.03%.
Meanwhile, the conversion of the grafted magnetic solid acid after
the first cycle was 88.49%, and a small decline was observed for the
next five cycles, which is mainly due to higher stability of the acid
sites of the grafted catalysts. After six times of recycle, the conversion
of the grafted solid acid still attained 85.61% with better stability,
which can be confirmed by acidity detection of the grafted catalyst
after six cycle times, showing that the amount of acid was slightly
reduced from 1.584 to 1.203 mmol/g. Furthermore, the better thermal
stability of the grafted catalyst from the thermogravimetric analysis
(Figure 8), compared
with the impregnated catalyst, also further supported the results
of both conversion rates in Figure 7. The stability of both was comparable to those of
the reported solid acid catalytic systems,26,27 especially the grafted magnetic solid acid.

Figure 8 Comparison of TG analysis
of catalysts.

Additionally, the catalytic properties of conventional
solid acids
were also studied,28−30 and a comparison with other solid acid catalysts
under the same above conditions was analyzed as shown in Table 1. As can be seen,
the solid acids exhibited high catalytic activity in the esterification
reaction but still lower than those of the impregnated and grafted
solid acids in this case, and the activity of the impregnated solid
acid can be comparable to that of concentrated sulfuric acid. Combining Figures 4 and 7, it can be found that the solid acid prepared herein is not
only easy to separate but also exhibits high catalytic activity and
cyclic stability, thus showing a potential industrial application.

Conclusions
The Fe3O4 MNPs were
prepared as the magnetic
core of the magnetic SiO2 solid acid. The characterization
results showed that the SiO2 was successfully coated on
Fe3O4 particles. The −SO3H
was also loaded on the catalysts after acid modification. The catalytic
properties indicated that the impregnated magnetic solid acid showed
a better catalytic activity (an esterification rate of up to 99.00%),
while the grafted magnetic solid acid showed a better cyclic stability
(the conversion attained 85.61%) after six times of recycle. Compared
to the previously reported nonmagnetic solid catalysts, the magnetic
solid acid prepared in this paper had a simple magnetic recovery process,
higher catalytic activity, and cyclic stability, which can be a highly
effective solid acid catalyst for green chemical processes.

Experimental Section
Materials
All chemicals including trisodium citrate,
ferric chloride, urea, polyacrylamide, polyethylene glycol, ethanol,
ammonia, tetraethyl orthosilicate(TEOS), sulfuric acid(98 wt %), 3-mercaptopropyl
trimethoxysilane (MPTMS), toluene, methanol, hydrogen peroxide(H2O2, 30 wt %), adipic acid, n-butanol,
cyclohexane, saturated saline were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd. All other unlabeled chemicals were of analytical
grade, and no further purification was required.

Preparation of Sulfonated Magnetic SiO2 Solid Acid
The steps for preparing the sulfonated magnetic SiO2 solid acid are as follows. 8 mmol of trisodium citrate, 4 mmol of
FeCl3, and 12 mmol of urea were first dissolved in 80 mL
of deionized water. Then 8 mmol of polyacrylamide and 0.4 mmol of
polyethylene glycol were stirred and dissolved in deionized water.
Next, the mixture was continuously reacted at 200 °C in a hydrothermal
reaction kettle for 6 h, subsequently separated by an external magnet
attraction, thoroughly washed with deionized water, and dried in a
vacuum oven at 60 °C. Finally, the Fe3O4 MNPs were obtained by cooling and grinding.

Magnetic SiO2 microspheres were prepared by a procedure previously reported.31 1 mmol of Fe3O4 MNPs,
0.4 mol of ethanol, and 0.08 mol of deionized water were added into
a three-neck flask. The solution was stirred until it was dispersed
homogeneously. Then 0.08 mol of ammonia and 0.02 mol of TEOS were
added dropwise, with subsequent stirring at 35 °C for 3 h. Next,
the mixture was magnetically separated, thoroughly washed with deionized
water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C to obtain the magnetic
SiO2 microspheres.

The sulfonated magnetic SiO2 solid acid was prepared
by impregnation and grafting methods as follows. For the former, SiO2 microspheres and sulfuric acid(m(SiO2):m(sulfuric acid) = 1:10) were heated at
200 °C for 4 h, and then the mixture was separated by a magnet
attraction after cooling to room temperature, washed to the neutral
filtrate, and finally dried. For the latter, 1 g of SiO2 microspheres, 0.3 mL of MPTMS, and 10 mL of toluene were refluxed
at 110 °C for 12 h and subsequently dried after washing with
toluene and ethanol, and then 30 mL of H2O2,
10 mL methanol, and 0.25 mL of sulfuric acid were added into the mixture.
Finally, the solid acid sample was obtained by stirring and drying.

Characterization of the Samples
Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed by
a PHILIPS XL30 instrument with a working voltage of 15 kV and a JEOL
2100F instrument with a working voltage of 200 kV, respectively. The
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Phillips Xpert
Pro powder diffraction system using Cu Kα radiation with a Ni
filter over the range of 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 80°.
Magnetic properties were measured using a BHV-55 vibrating sample
magnetometer (VSM) from Riken Electronics Co. Ltd., Japan. FT-IR spectra
(4000–500 cm–1) were recorded at room temperature
on a Bruker VERTEX 70 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr in a ratio of 1:200.

Catalyst Properties
The catalyst properties are shown
by the esterification rate and cyclic stability. The loading amounts
(mmol/g) of total acids in the catalyst were determined using the
modified acid–base titration referred to the literature.32−34 The 0.6 mL saturated saline was added into a mixed solution of 0.2
g of sulfonated magnetic SiO2 solid acid, 3.65 g of adipic
acid, 4.6 mL of n-butanol, and 5 mL of cyclohexane
in a 100 mL three-neck flask, subsequently stirred, and dissolved.
Phenolphthalein was used as an indicator and titrated with 0.1 mol/L
NaOH solution to determine the initial acid value and the reaction
acid value, in which the calculation method was based on the Chinese
national standard (GB/T1668-2008). The esterification rate was measured
as follows 1   2  where X is
the acid value, mg/g; Y is the esterification rate,
%; c is the concentration of the standard NaOH solution,
mol/L; V1 and V2 are the volumes of the NaOH solution consumed before and after the
reaction, respectively, mL; X1 and X2 are the acid values before and after the reaction,
mg/g; m is the mass of the reaction solution, g;
and 56.11 is the conversion factor.

TOF (turn over frequency)
was calculated by the data of the moles of converted reactant, the
moles of acid sites, and the reaction equilibrium time, which reflected
the intrinsic activity of the catalyst, and usually was measured as
follows35 3  

The
steps for catalyst recycling experiment are as follows: the
catalyst sulfonated magnetic solid acid was recovered by magnetic
separation when the reaction was completed. The recovered catalyst
was washed with methanol and dried at 105 °C in a vacuum oven.
The recovered catalyst was reused for the next cycle, and other steps
were the same.
