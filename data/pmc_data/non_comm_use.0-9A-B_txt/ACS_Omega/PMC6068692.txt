Amino-silanization
of silica-based substrates has proven to be
effective in guiding the immobilization of citrate-stabilized Au NPs
in a good, homogeneous fashion. This accomplishment has formed the
basis of fabricating micropatterns of Au NPs on such substrates by
patterning of oxidized silicon wafers with (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane
(amino-silane) using the microcontact printing (μCP) process.
This micropattern of amino-silane is used to specifically adsorb Au
NPs. To avoid unspecific adsorption to the nonsilanized areas on the
silicon wafers, the nonstamped areas were backfilled with self-assembled
monolayers of organosilanes, for example, with methyl- or perfluoro-end-groups.
Finally, after having fabricated a micropattern of Au NPs on silicon
wafers, the Au NP patterns were transferred onto poly(ethylene glycol)
hydrogels by our newly developed procedures, and on these nanocomposite
materials, controlled cell adhesion has been achieved. Furthermore,
these materials are great candidates for plasmon-based biosensor applications
and also for various medical applications, such as for drug delivery
systems or photothermal therapies.

Introduction
Surface modifications
are of great importance in various research
and applied fields, ranging from chemistry, mechanical, or electrical
engineering to industry.1−5 Hereby, the original or intrinsic property of a material, such as
the reactivity, wettability, hydrophilicity, or biological activity,
can be changed, specifically tuned and adjusted to conform to the
applied environment. Especially self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of
organosilanes (silanization) have offered a great opportunity for
achieving that goal.6,7 Silanization is a method for functionalizing
the surface of a substrate using organosilane molecules, which have
general molecular structures of RSiX3, R2SiX2, or R3SiX, hereby X is chloride or alkoxy-group
and R is typically a hydrocarbon chain with a functional group. After
hydrolysis and condensation reactions, the molecules are covalently
attached to the surface and effectively modify its chemical properties.6,8−10 For instance, using SAMs in biological or biomedical
fields, attractive or repulsive interactions of proteins, DNA, or
anti-bodies with the biointerface can be manipulated to obtain the
desired biointeraction.11,12

Of particular
interest for biomaterials applications are surface
modifications involving poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), a highly hydrophilic,
nontoxic, and nonimmunogenic polymer.13,14 PEG monolayers
have demonstrated to be intrinsically nonadhesive toward proteins
and consequently also nonadhesive toward whole cells; they are highly
inert toward biomolecular interactions.15 Those properties make PEG in SAMs on silicon or glass surfaces especially
attractive as inert backgrounds for studying specific biointeractions.
Furthermore, by combining SAM technology with lithographic methods
(vide infra), nano- or micro-patterns on surfaces can be fabricated.7,16−18 Micro- or nano-patterning of surfaces is of great
interest in many fields, not restricted to biological applications,
such as micro- or nano-electronics,19−21 switchable systems,22 biosensors, and nano-biotechnology.23

PEG with reactive end-groups can be easily
cross-linked, for example,
by photoinitiated radical cross-linking or other chemical cross-linking
procedures, to form hydrogels.24,25 Hydrogels are three-dimensional
networks of hydrophilic polymers (macromonomers) which can absorb
huge amounts of water without being dissolved. By variation of the
chain-length of the macromonomers, using additional cross-linkers
or changing the chemical compositions the elastic, physical, or chemical
properties of the hydrogels can be specifically varied, which make
them highly versatile materials that find numerous applications such
as in care products,26,27 contact lenses,28 drug delivery,29 or tissue engineering.30 Even more than PEG SAMs on hard (glass) substrates,
soft PEG hydrogels are an ideal, inert background that suppresses
nonspecific interactions. This enables the introduction of specific
binding sites onto the surface of PEG hydrogels at designed locations
and in an optimal density for studying specific biointeraction and
manipulating31−33 In the past years, we have exploited several strategies
to enable adhesion, spreading, and migration of fibroblast cells on
intrinsically nonadhesive PEG-hydrogels. We have fabricated topographic,
elastic, and chemical patterns on the hydrogels’ surface, both
at the micro- and nano-scale and achieved great control over the cellular
responses.34−44

One example of chemical modification is the incorporation
of nanoparticles
for achieving nanocomposite materials.45 Among them, especially for application in biological or biomedical
fields, Au NPs are highly desired because of their little toxicity
and various possibilities to synthesize them with different sizes,
shapes, and surface molecules, where the optical and chemical properties
can be also varied.46 We and others have
discovered that the decoration of PEG surfaces with Au NPs is an effective
way to study and control specific biointeraction and cell adhesion.
Hereby, not only the size and shape but also the density and naturally
the surface chemistry of the Au NPs are variable parameters by which
the biointerfaces can be tuned.

For example, Spatz et al. have
reported extensively about their
elegant studies of how the interparticle distance between Au NPs (immobilized
on PEG-coated glass) should match the nanoscale distribution of the
integrin receptors on the cell membrane.47−49 To ensure selective
cell adhesion to the nanoscopic anchoring sites, they functionalized
the Au NPs with a cell adhesive peptide, that is, RGD. They also demonstrated
that they could transfer Au NPs from hard substrates to soft PEG hydrogels
by functionalizing the Au NPs with reactive (e.g., acrylate) groups
that covalently bound to the PEG-macromonomers.50 Notwithstanding the quality of their results and the great
insight their studies have yielded, their procedures involved partly
complicated functionalization steps with delicate and expensive molecules.

We have recently demonstrated that we can transfer as-synthesized,
citrate-capped Au NPs to the surface of PEG hydrogels without the
need for any surface modification of the Au NP surface.39,41 Obviously, the chemical modification of the hydroxyl end groups
on the PEG polymer chains by thiol groups was found to make the transfer
of the Au NPs especially efficient (transfer efficiency of >98%
is
feasible).39 But also nonfunctionalized
PEG gels, for example, UV-cured gels from PEG diacrylate, have been
successfully employed to peel off Au NPs when taking advantage of
the swelling ability of the hydrogels. We call this process “wet
deprinting”, which we can also perform in a micro-patterned
fashion, hence “wet μ-CdP”.41

Furthermore, we observed effective cell adhesion
on our nonfunctionalized
Au NPs. This has inspired us to develop many more of such unique nano-
and micro-patterning procedures for patterning Au NPs on PEG hydrogels
with the aim of locally controlling the cell adhesion.39−43

Concerning the sizes of the cells, that is, ∼10–20
μm, the controlled dimensions of the micro-sized patterns are
of great importance for the spatial control of cell adhesion. While
photo- and e-beam lithography are versatile micro- and nano-fabrication
techniques, they are either limited in the achievable feature size
or become slow and costly whenever smaller features are aimed at.51−53 Those drawbacks are effectively overcome by the invention of soft
lithography. That is why we take advantage of established, effective
soft-lithographic methods, such as micro-contact printing (μCP),7 as developed by Whitesides et al., or the nano-transfer
printing54 method from Rogers et al. in
combination with sinusoidal or wrinkled stamps.55 Nevertheless, we also further developed our own technologies,
such as micro-contact deprinting (μ-CdP) via heating of the
stamp above the glass transition temperature56 or using chemically or elastically modified hydrogels,40 wet micro-contact deprinting (wet μ-CdP),41 and nanocontact transfer using nanowrinkled
poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamps.42

In this work, we present yet another method, taking advantage
of
μCP and our own transfer methods. First, micropatterns of amino-silanes
are printed on silicon wafers, which ensure the spatially controlled
immobilization of citrate capped Au NPs following the process of Li
et al.18 and the remaining nonstamped area
are backfilled with another silane type (e.g., with methyl-, or perfluoro-end-groups),
which effectively avoid Au NP attachment.57 In the second step, the Au NP pattern is transferred onto the PEG
hydrogel surface by one of our recently developed transfer methodologies,
in particular the “dry” transfer using thiolated PEG
gels and the wet deprinting approach.39−43

These novel micropatterned nanocomposite substrates
are ultimately
applied in cell culture studies with the aim of controlling selective
cell adhesion of fibroblasts to the micropatterns of Au NPs.

Results
and Discussion
In this work, a two-step process is used to
achieve a micropattern
of Au NPs on the surface of PEG-based hydrogels (Scheme 1). First, a micropattern of
Au NPs on the surface of a silicon wafer was achieved, and then this
Au NP pattern was transferred as a whole onto the surface of PEG hydrogels
by our recently developed transfer techniques.

Scheme 1 (a) Process of Successive
Micropatterning with Different Silanes
for Micropatterning of Au NPs on Silicon Wafers; (b) Transfer of Au
NP Pattern from Silicon Surfaces onto PEG-Based Hydrogels
The first challenge was to
achieve a good pattern on the silicon
wafer which was done via μCP of (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane
(amino-silane) on the surface of oxidized silicon wafers. This micropattern
of amino-silane was used to specifically adsorb Au NPs.18 Unspecific adsorption to nonsilanized areas
on the silicon wafer had been observed and therefore it was of interest
to solve this problem by efficient backfilling of the nonstamped area
with SAMs of organosilane,57,58 for example, with methyl-
or perfluoro-end-groups, which provide a certain inertness to these
area and avoid unspecific Au NP adhesion (Scheme 1a). Finally, after achieving a relatively
good pattern on the silicon wafer, the Au NPs were transferred onto
the surface of PEG-based hydrogels (Scheme 1b) where cell adhesion could be locally controlled.

In detail, first of all, amino-silane molecules were printed on
the surface of the silicon wafers using PDMS stamps exhibiting microsized
topographic patterns (Figure 1a).18 The microcontact printed
amino-silane layer is shown in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image
in Figure 1b,c. Hereby,
the pattern size for the master was (20 μm–10 μm–5
μm), that is the printed (contacted) area had a width of 10
μm and a distance of 20 μm, which can be well recognized
in the AFM height image and in the cross section profile in Figure 1b,c. In the cross
section profile in Figure 1c, a height of around 0.7–1.8 nm for the amino-silane
layer was observed. The height of 0.7 nm is comparable with the literature
values for a monolayer of amino-silane on surfaces.

with 3-numeric codes; w–s–d = width of the
grooves–spacing between the grooves–depth of the grooves
of a relief pattern; (b,c) AFM height images and cross section profile
of amino-silane-micro-pattern on silicon wafer; pattern size of the
used stamp (20 μm–10 μm–5 μm).

In Figure 2, the
AFM height images and cross section profiles of the amino-silane pattern;
(a) before backfilling and (b) after backfilling with octadecyl-silane
are presented. The height profiles show the heights on the free or
backfilled areas: in Figure 2a the height profile of the nonstamped area on the oxidized
silicon-wafer show a height of around 0.1–0.5 nm and an rms
roughness of 123 pm, whereas after backfilling the height profile
was increased to around 2–5 nm and an rms roughness of 1.1
nm was measured. For a monolayer of octadecyl-silane, a height value
of 2.65–2.76 nm was reported,58−61 that means the backfilled surface
was either a mono or a double layer.

backfilled with octadecyl-silane. The cross section profiles were
measured on the (a) free or (b) backfilled area. Pattern size of the
used stamp (20 μm–10 μm–5 μm).

On this micropattern of amino-silane
silicon wafer, Au NPs were
deposited, which is shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images in Figure 3;
there, in Figure 3a,
a pattern of 10 μm wide brighter lines and 20 μm wide,
comparably darker lines are recognizable. The brightness of the SEM
results was evoked by the high electron densities of the Au NPs. In Figure 3b,c which were magnified
images, the Au NPs were clearly visible. From these results, it is
visible that the Au NPs were found over the whole sample but with
different packing densities. On the amino-silane lines, the Au NPs
were more densely packed than on the oxidized silicon wafer.

pattern size of the used stamp (20 μm–10 μm–5
μm): scale bars: (a) 40 μm; (b) 4 μm; (c) 1 μm.

This pattern of differently densely
packed Au NPs was then transferred
onto hydrogels by merely contacting the free standing hydrogel with
the Au NP pattern on the silicon wafer (Schemes 1b and 2).

(b) Nonfunctional PEG Hydrogels via Wet-Deprinting Process
Images modified from refs (39) and (41).

In this work, two different hydrogels were used to transfer the
Au NPs; (a) onto free standing 8PEG-SH hydrogels or (b) onto nonfunctional
PEG hydrogels by virtue of swelling the UV-cured film before peeling
it off. Details can be found in the Experimental Section (vide infra).

Starting off with the process depicted in Scheme 2a, that is, using thiolated 8PEG hydrogels,
in Figure 4 SEM images
of the transferred Au NPs on 8PEG hydrogel are shown. In analogy to
the Au NP patterns on silicon wafer before transfer, the Au NPs on
the PEG surface were found over the whole sample, while exhibiting
different packing densities (see Figure 4c,d). The area transferred from the nonstamped
area was relatively more loosely packed (Figure 4c) and from amino-silane layer were more
densely packed with Au NPs (Figure 4d); that is the original pattern was effectively transferred
onto the surface of PEG hydrogel.

Figure 4 SEM images of Au NPs transferred on 8PEG-SH
hydrogel. Scale bars:
(a) 20 μm; (b) 400 nm; (c) 400 nm; (d) 200 nm.

To achieve even more clearly defined patterns of
Au NP and non-Au
NP areas on the silicon surface, the process was further improved
by backfilling of the remaining, nonstamped areas with another type
of silane, which should not bind or interact with Au NPs. While coating
of a surface with amino-silanes caused highly densely packed citrate-capped
Au NPs39,40,42 because of
electrostatic interactions, backfilling of the remaining area with
other silanes (e.g., with end groups: −CH3, −CF3) would expectedly minimize the adhesion of citrate-capped
Au NPs. For that the remaining areas were silanized either with octadecyl-silane
using the liquid silanization process or with perfluoro-silane via
the vapor-silanization method.

In Figure 5, SEM
images of the Au NP-coated silicon wafer on amino- and octadecyl-silane
lines are shown. Again, a high packing density of Au NPs on amino-lines
and quite few Au NPs on the surface of the octadecyl-silane-lines
were visible. Some brighter features on the SEM images were observable
as well, which were presumably agglomerated Au NPs attached on the
surface of the sample. Such agglomeration can be either due to aging
effects of the Au NPs in the solution or due to the irregular distribution
of the of amino-silane SAM. These agglomerations of Au NPs were also
found on octadecyl-silane layers, which might be caused when the whole
backfilled surface was not completely covered by octadecyl-silane
and consequently the oxidized surface might be not absolutely made
inert toward Au NPs attachment.

Figure 5 SEM images of Au NP coating on amino-
and octadecyl-silane pattern.
Scale bars: (a) 100 μm; (b) 10 μm.

In Figure 6, AFM
height images with a cross section profile of the deposited Au NPs
on the amino- and octadecyl-silane-layers are shown; hereby, in accordance
with the observations of the SEM results, a high density of Au NPs
on amino-silane layer and only few particles on the octadecyl-silane-layer
are observable. The height profiles show a height of around 20–50
nm in a large area on the amino-silane layer with some agglomerations.
The hereby used Au NPs had a size of 20 nm, while a height of 40–50
nm was measured by AFM. In these cases, probably even double Au NP
layers might be formed on the amino-silane surface or there might
be an effect of side or vertical polymerizations of SAMs which increased
the height profile and even lead to agglomeration effects of the Au
NPs.62

and cross section profile

Perfluoro-silanes are known for
their hydrophobicity and chemically
inert characteristics; therefore, they were also used as coating for
our silicon masters to keep them clean and nonreactive toward the
stamps or replica molds. These inert characteristics were also applied
for patterning of silane agent methods for having a nonreactive area
or nonbinding sites for Au NP adhesions besides the well-reactive
amino-silane lines. Hereby, the amino-silane patterned silicon wafer
was backfilled with perfluoro-silane using the vapor-silanization
process and on this wafer, Au NPs were deposited, which is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 SEM images of Au NPs
coating on amino- and perfluoro-silane-pattern.
Scale bars: (a) 100 μm; (b) 10 μm.

In Figure 7, similar
to the backfilling reaction of amino-silane patterns with octadecyl-silane,
highly dense Au NPs on the amino-silane layer and a few agglomerated
particles over the whole surface of amino- and perfluoro-silane is
observable via SEM images. Further Au NP coating on amino- and perfluoro-pattern
is shown via AFM height images, cross section profiles, and phase
images in Figure 8.
Hereby, the stamping area for amino-silane had a width of 20 μm,
which is observable in the phase image in Figure 8a as a brighter line in a darker surrounding,
which represented the perfluoro-silane layer. On the perfluoro-silane
layer, some brighter features are also visible, which can be also
recognized in the height image in Figure 8b as agglomerations of Au NPs with heights
of around 100 nm. Some more agglomerations with around the same height
sizes are also visible on the amino-silane lines. On the amino-silane
lines the distribution of the 20 nm Au NPs as a monolayer exactly
on the amino-silane stamped area are visible. This can be clearly
seen in Figure 8c,d,
which are phase and height images and a cross section profile of an
enlarged view of an edge of the stamped and nonstamped area from Figure 8b. In the phase image,
the amino-templated line, which contained the Au NPs is recognized
by the bright color, whereas the backfilled part is seen in darker
color. The height image and profile exhibited a height of 18–40
nm for the Au NP sizes; the size distribution could be due to the
polydispersity of the synthesized Au NPs.

(b) height image and cross section profile;
(c) magnified phase image; and (d) magnified height image and cross
section profile.

These Au NP patterns
were subsequently transferred onto PEG hydrogel
surfaces, in this case using the procedure as schematically depicted
in Scheme 2b, namely,
by virtue of swelling a UV-cured PEG film before peeling it off. In
recent years, we have worked extensively with such PEG hydrogels and
know from our experience that they are highly cytocompatible, while
they are intrinsically nonadhesive to proteins and cells.

Eventually,
cell adhesion studies on these hydrogels with Au NP
micro-lines were performed. As observed by optical microscopy, already
after 2 h of cultivation time of murine fibroblast cells, the cells
were accumulating on the Au NP patterns. Apart from the cells, the
pattern can be recognized in the form of darker and brighter lines.
Here, the darker lines correspond to Au NP lines and the brighter
lines are the pure PEG hydrogel. In some cases, small irregular black
dots were visible, which are probably agglomerations of Au NPs, which
were previously observed on the silicon surfaces and that were transferred
onto the hydrogel as well.

Analyzing the behavior of cell adhesion
on the patterned surface
after 24 h (Figure 9), it can be recognized that the cells were selectively adhering
on the Au NP lines and most of them were aligning following the line
pattern (marked by blue ellipses). Some other cells were not directly
adhering on the Au NP lines but were either bridging over the PEG
lines (green circle) or residing as round shapes on the PEG area (pink
ellipse on the right).

Figure 9 Optical micrograph of cell adhesion on Au NP-patterned
PEG hydrogel.

Further qualitative analysis
of the cellular behavior (Table S1) supported
the qualitative statements;
(i) 86 ± 5% of cells were attached on the Au NP lines in total
(including the bridging cells), and (ii) 71 ± 8% of the cells
were aligning on the Au NP lines following the pattern direction at
an angle of 0°–10°.

To get an insight in the
timescale of the selective cell adhesion,
we observed the cell culture at different time points, that is, 30
min, 2 h, and 24 h. Figure 10 shows the time dependency of the cell adhesion to the patterned
substrates.

Figure 10 Optical micrographs of cell culture (a–c) on Au
NP micropattern
on PEG hydrogels with different cultivation times and (d) on pure
PEG after 24 h.

Figure 10a is an
image after 30 min of cultivation time. At this early time point,
the cells had round shapes and were only slightly attaching on the
surface without showing any preference; in addition to residing on
the Au NP lines, many cells were seen on the pure PEG lines as well.
After 2 h of cultivation time, some lamellipodia of the cells could
be observed and more than half of the total amount of cells (∼60%)
were found on Au NP lines (see Figure 10b). At the end point of the observation
(after 24 h of cultivation), up to 90% of the cells were on the Au
NP lines, and were stretched along the direction of the lines, which
is shown in Figure 10c. Again, some cells were oriented rather perpendicularly to the
Au NP lines, establishing contacts to two parallel lines and bridging
over the pure PEG hydrogel line. As a control, on pure PEG hydrogel
surfaces cells were not adhering at all (Figure 10d).

Using this printing-based patterning
method, any pattern size and
shape can be obtained, depending on the design of the (silicon) master
and relying on the integrity of the PDMS stamp. This is of great advantage
for applications in which, for example, curved or sharp-cornered edges
are desired instead of linear and right-cornered ones. For our eventual
aim of controlling cell adhesion, spherical shapes are also interesting
features. Therefore, as an example to micropattern Au NPs on PEG hydrogels
in spherical-shaped patterns, we prepared a stamp with cylindrical
pillar-like topographic patterns. The resulting equidistant dots (of
∼50 μm in size) of Au NPs on the hydrogel surface are
shown in Figure S2. By tuning the sizes
and shapes of the dots with respect to the sizes of the cells, control
over selective cell adhesion can be obtained, so that single cells
can be distinctly separated and studied.

Conclusions
In
this work a novel, cheap, and fast surface micropatterning procedure
based on soft lithography for micropatterning of Au NPs first on silicon
wafers were proposed, which were then transferred onto PEG-based hydrogels
for studying cellular interactions. For this approach, well-defined
line pattern of Au NPs on silica surfaces as the first step of the
process was generated. This was achieved with two different patterning
principles relying on soft lithography techniques. In both cases,
SAMs of (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (amino-silane) served as platform
to immobilize Au NPs effectively through electrostatic interactions
between negatively charged citrate groups stabilizing the Au NPs and
positively charged terminal amino groups of amino-silane. The first
and more intensely studied patterning strategy involves μCP
of amino-silane with an elastomeric patterned PDMS stamp. AFM measurements
confirmed the successful silanization with amino-silane assembled
in desired line pattern. Deposition of Au NPs onto those surfaces
provided a nonspecific attachment of Au NPs over the whole silicon
surface, whereas a pattern of densely packed Au NPs on amino-silane
layer and more loosely packed Au NPs onto the pure oxidized silicon
surface was discovered. To protect the spaces between the amino-silane
lines from Au NP binding, the remaining nonstamped areas were backfilled
with two different silanazing agents, namely, octadecyltrichlorosilane
(octadecyl-silane) and trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (perfluoro-silane).
In general, it can be concluded that these silanazing agents were
effective in backfilling. The backfilling with octadecyl-silane worked
out with liquid deposition and the perfluoro-silane was done by chemical
vapor deposition. Octadecyl- and perfluoro-silane were both well-studied
to be known as effective in creating hydrophobic surfaces. This presumably
was the reason for effective shielding of the backfilled area from
nonselective Au NP attachment onto those areas. Although bigger Au
NP aggregations, as they were probably formed by means of aging effect
or impurities, appeared to be nonspecifically distributed across patterned
silica wafer, only within amino-silane treated areas, the expected
regular arrangements of nanoparticles were detectable. Nevertheless,
the achieved Au NP micropattern was effectively transferred onto PEG-based
hydrogels. Cell adhesion studies with murine fibroblasts showed that
large amounts of cells were effectively adhering and aligning following
the predefined microlines of Au NPs, whereas some amounts of cells
could be found on the nonexpected PEG area as well, which resulted
from the agglomerated Au NPs that previously were discovered on the
silicon wafer and were transferred on the hydrogel as well. These
patterns of Au NPs on PEG-based hydrogels can be, besides for cell
adhesion and tissue engineering devices, also applied in nanoplasmonics-based
biosensing applications, drug delivery systems, and photothermal therapies.

Synthetic Procedures
Synthesis
of Au NPs
Citrate-capped gold nanoparticles
of ∼20 nm diameter were synthesized following the protocol
by Bastús et al.99 Briefly, in a
three-necked round-bottom flask, 0.049 g (0.17 mmol) of trisodium
citrate was solved in 75 mL of deionized water and heated for 15 min
under vigorous stirring. A condenser was applied to prevent evaporation
of the solvent. After boiling had commenced, 0.5 mL of a solution
of 0.246 g of (0.63 mmol) H[AuCl4]·3H2O
dissolved in 25 mL of deionized water was quickly added to the reducing
agent solution. The resulting pink mixture was kept under stirring
under reflux for additional 10 min before quenching the reaction with
an ice bad.

Synthesis of Hydrogels
The hydroxyl
end groups on the
eight-arm, star-shaped macromonomer 8PEG-OH were functionalized with
vinyl sulfone (VS) end-groups, yielding 8PEG-VS macromonomers, according
to the protocol as described in ref (37).

Films of 8PEG-VS were formed between
an objective glass and a cover slip, by reaction with ammonia (Michael-type
addition reaction). The incompletely reacted gel was immersed in dithiothreitol
(DTT), which reacted (in a second Michael-type addition reaction)
with the remaining VS-groups to form thiol (−SH) groups. Details
of the film formation and thiolation are given below, between Schemes 1 and 2.

Patterning
Perfluoro-silanization
of Silicon Masters
For the preparation
of PDMS stamps, microrelief patterned silicon master were used, which
were purchased from AMO GmbH (Aachen, Germany). The sizes of the pattern
are described with a three-numeric code: w–s–d = width of the grooves–spacing
between the grooves–depth of the grooves, as shown in Figure 1.

The surfaces
of the silicon masters were first made chemically inert via coating
of the surface with a perfluoro-silane SAM. For that, the silicon
masters were cleaned with water, acetone, and isopropanol and dried
with a stream of nitrogen. For the activation of the surface, the
cleaned silicon masters were oxidized via immersion in a piranha solution
(H2SO4/H2O2; 7:3; v/v)
for 30 min. Then, the master was washed with deionized water and isopropanol
and dried with a stream of nitrogen. After the activation of the surfaces,
the silicon masters were placed in a clean Petridish and then placed
into a desiccator. Incidentally, in a small vial containing 1–2
drops of the silanizing agent perfluoro-silane agent was placed into
the desiccator together with the silicon masters. Then, the desiccator
was kept under vacuum for 2 h. After that, the silanized silicon wafers
were washed with toluene and isopropanol and then dried under a flow
of nitrogen.

Preparation of the PDMS Stamp
The
PDMS stamp was prepared
by using a mixture of Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer and curing agent
(10:1; v/v). To avoid bubbles, the mixture was degassed in a desiccator,
and then casted on the perfluorinated silicon master using the replica
molding process,63 cured 2 h at 120 °C
and finally was peeled off from the silicon master. The resulting
PDMS stamp was a negative copy of the silicon master.

Microcontact
Printing of Silicon Wafer with Amino-silane
The μCP
with amino-silane SAMs was performed according to the
method from Li et al.18 Hereby, the silicon
wafers were sonicated successively in water, acetone, and isopropanol
for 5 min and were immersed in a piranha solution (H2SO4/H2O2; 7:3; v/v) for 30 min. Then, the
wafers were washed with deionized water and isopropanol and dried
with nitrogen gas. Some drops of 1% amino-silane aqueous solution
were dispensed on the surface of the topographically patterned PDMS
stamp. After inking for 2 min, the stamp was dried with nitrogen flow
and brought into contact with the substrate for around 15 s.

Backfilling
of the Microcontact Printed Silicon Wafer with Different
Silane Agents
Subsequently after amino-silane molecules were
printed on the surface of the silicon wafers using micro relief-molded
PDMS stamps, the remaining, nonstamped areas were backfilled with
another type of silane, which has less attractive interactions with
the Au NPs, namely, with octadecyltrichlorosilane (octadecyl-silane)
or trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (perfluoro-silane) (with
end groups: −CH3, −CF3, resp.),
which minimize the adhesion of citrate-capped Au NPs.

Backfilling
with Octadecyl-silane
The backfilling of
the nonsilanized spaces between the microlines of amino-silane with
octadecyl-silane was done with the liquid silanization method according
to Hsieh et al.64 Hereby, the with amino-silane
microcontact printed wafers were immersed in a solution of 5 mM octadecyl-silane
dissolved in toluene for 18 h under an inert gas atmosphere (N2). Afterward, the samples were washed in toluene and isopropanol
and dried under a stream of nitrogen.

Backfilling with Perfluoro-silane
The backfilling with
perfluoro-silane was carried out using the vapor deposition method.
For that the amino-silane patterned wafers were placed in a desiccator
together with a small vial containing 1–2 drops of the perfluoro-silane
agents. Subsequently, the desiccator vas vacuumed for 15–20
min and vacuum was kept for an additional 2 h. After the backfilling
was finished, the samples were washed in toluene and isopropanol and
dried under a stream of nitrogen.

Transfer of Au NP Patterns
onto PEG Hydrogels
In a
two-step process, Au NP patterns (Scheme 1a) were subsequently transferred onto PEG
hydrogel surfaces, which is schematically depicted in Scheme 1b.

Concerning the transfer
method, we investigated two different approaches, as depicted in Scheme 2; the Au NPs were
either transferred (a) onto free standing 8PEG-SH hydrogels or (b)
onto nonfunctional PEG hydrogels by virtue of swelling the UV-cured
film before peeling it off. Details of the two approaches were depicted
in Scheme 2a,b and
are elaborated here:a) First of all, films of 8PEG-SH hydrogels
were prepared according to the procedure described in our previous
publication (ref (39)): 20 wt % of ammonium solution (30% NH3 in H2O) were added to the precursor solution of 8-arm PEG VS (8PEG-VS)
with 50% water content at room-temperature under vigorous magnetic
stirring until the solution turned to a viscous liquid. Compositions
were set to receive 5% NH3-8PEG by weight. The resulting
liquids were deposited on a glass slide and covered with a glass cover
slip. After 30 min, the 8PEG-VS hydrogel film was formed. After gel
formation, the colorless polymeric films formed with 5% NH3 were peeled off mechanically. The stand-alone films (250–300
μm in thickness) were handled with tweezers. These hydrogels
were immersed in DTT solution (5 mg/mL) for 60 min to yield thiolated
films (8PEG-SH). Afterward, these hydrogels were washed thoroughly
with water several times and stored in water before use.40 Then, the stand-alone hydrogel film was brought
in conformal contact with the Au NP micropattern on the silicon wafer.
In that way, the Au NPs were transferred onto the PEG hydrogel (Scheme 2a).

b) A few drops of PEG precursor (PEG)
mixed with 1 wt % photoinitiator Irgacure 2959 were casted on the
surface of the Au NP-patterned silicon wafer. Subsequently, the polymer
was UV-cured; for that, a droplet of PEG precursor mixed with 1 wt
% photoinitiator Irgacure 2959 was placed on the as-created Au NP
micropattern surface, covered with a thin glass cover slip followed
by UV-curing (365 nm, 6 W) in an oxygen-free atmosphere for 30 min.
The created PEG hydrogel on the silicon wafer was lifted off from
the silicon surface by swelling of the hydrogel in water. During the
swelling process, the Au NP micropatterns were transferred as a whole
onto PEG hydrogeĺs surface (Scheme 2b).



Characterization
Methods
Optical, Scanning Electron, and Atomic Force Microscopy
Optical images were taken with the Axio Observer.Z1 (Carl Zeiss)
and analyzed using the Axio Vision software (V4.8.2 Carl Zeiss). Scanning
electron images were taken with a Hitachi S-520 using an acceleration
voltage of 20 kV and a working distance of 10 mm. Pictures were taken
using the digital image processing system (2.6.20.1, Point Electronic).
Topographical images of samples in wet state were recorded using a
Nanowizard II scanning probe microscope from JPK instruments. Measurements
were performed in tapping mode using an aluminium-coated silicon cantilever
(TAP300AL-G) with aluminium reflex coating (k ≈
20–75 N/m, f0 ≈ 300 kHz;
Budget Sensors). Images were edited with NanoWizard IP Version 3.3a
(JPK instruments).

Infrared Spectroscopy
Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Nicolet iS5 Spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) equipped with a horizontal
reflection attenuated total reflection accessory including a germanium
crystal. Spectra were recorded in a wavelength range from 600 to 4000
cm–1. For each spectrum, 256 scans were collected
with a nominal resolution of 8 cm–1. The background
was recorded for the Ge-ATR unit without any substrate pressed against
the crystal.

Contact Angle Measurements
Water
contact angle measurements
were performed using a OCA 20 from DataPhysics Instruments GmbH (Filderstadt,
Germany).

Cell Culture
Chemicals
RPMI
1640 medium, trypsin, fetal bovine serum
(FBS), and penicillin/streptomycin (PS) provided by PAA Laboratories
GmbH, Germany, and cell culture plates are from SPL Live Sciences
Inc., Korea. Incubator CB150 Series is from Binder GmbH, Germany.
Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (Dulbecco’s PBS) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, GmbH, Germany. The counter chamber
was from Marienfeld Superior (Paul Marienfeld GmbH & Co. KG, Germany).

Cell Culture
The murine fibroblasts L929 cells were
cultured in the tissue culture plate in RPMI 1640 medium with addition
of 10% FBS and 1% PS in a cell culture plate in an incubator at controlled
temperature (37 °C) and CO2 atmosphere (5%). The cells
were grown in a cell culture plate; when a confluency of at least
75% was reached, the cell culture experiment was performed.

Thereafter, the cells were washed with PBS, detached by using trypsin
and after the centrifugation process a new medium is added on the
cells and mixed properly. Ten microliters of these cell medium solution
is put on a cell counter chamber to count the cell number by using
an optical microscope and achieve a concentration of 40 000 cells/mL.
Depending on the counted cell number, the cell solution was mixed
with a defined amount of new medium. The hydrogel samples were prior
washed with water and kept in PBS solution for around 30 min before
cell culture experiment and placed in a tissue culture polystyrene
plate. The samples were then cultured within these cells for 24 h,
at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
