Quinoid-based ligands constitute
the most common class of redox-active
ligands used to construct electrically conductive and magnetic metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs). Whereas this chemistry is intensively explored
for transition-metal and lanthanide ions, any related actinide compound
has not received attention. In particular, the MOF chemistry of actinide
ions in the lower oxidation states is underexplored. We herein report
the synthesis, and structural and physical property characterization
of a uranium(IV) quinoid-based MOF, [U(Cl2dhbq)2(H2O)2]·4H2O (1, Cl2dhbq2– = deprotonated 2,5-dichloro-3,6-dihydroxybenzoquinone). 1 is a rare example of a U(IV)-based coordination solid and
the first material to incorporate bona fide reducible bridging ligands.
Despite the anticipated thermodynamic driving force, no indications
of valence tautomerism are evident from magnetometry, near-IR spectroscopy,
and X-band electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. These initial
results suggest that reduction potentials alone are insufficient as
guidelines for the prediction of the occurrence of electron transfer
in uranium–quinoid-based materials.

Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs), and coordination solids
in general, receive ever-increasing attention and numerous examples
of transition-metal-based MOFs have been reported to exhibit interesting
properties relevant for gas separation and storage, and catalysis.1−3 Recent studies have highlighted the possibilities to design MOFs
with high electrical conductivity applicable in supercapacitors and
chemical sensors, owing to the significant orbital overlap between
the metal ions and the bridging ligands.4−6 On the contrary, the
f-element-based MOFs are not as widely explored,7 and actinide-based MOFs are relatively rare.8−11 Whereas the majority of the existing uranium MOFs encompass UO22+ units,8,12 the reducing nature
of the lower oxidation states U(IV) and U(III) make these metal ion
units interesting components for MOFs comprising redox-active ligand
scaffolds. Notably, the few, previously reported uranium(IV) MOFs
are all based on redox-inactive carboxylate ligands.13−17 The introduction of U(IV)–L ↔ U(V)–L• valence tautomerism in MOFs would parallel the current methodology
employed in transition-metal chemistry to reveal strong magnetic interaction
and electronic conductivity through ligand-based mixed-valency.18 Despite the growing interest in uranium coordination
chemistry of redox-active ligands,19,20 no noninnocent
systems have been reported to extend beyond the dimensionality of
an isolated molecule. In transition-metal-based coordination solids,
an often-used redox-active ligand is 2,5-dichloro-3,6-dihydroxybenzoquinone
(“chloranilic acid”; Cl2dhbqH2), which may be reduced by up to two electrons, owing to the energetically
low-lying π* orbitals (Figure 1).21,22

Figure 1 Schematic overview of the accessible redox
states of Cl2dhbqn–.

Several examples of iron-based dihydroxybenzoquinone
coordination
solids have been shown to display strong magnetic interactions and
high electrical conductivity attributed to mixed-valency in the dihydroxybenzoquinone
ligand scaffold.23−27 Whereas many lanthanide systems incorporating closed-shell dihydroxybenzoquinone
ligands have been reported,28 the only
few examples of actinide ion systems incorporate nonoxidizable Th(IV)
and U(VI).28−31 In aqueous solution, U(IV) is moderately reducing and comparable
in reduction potential to the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox-couple.32 It could thus be hypothesized that U(IV) should
be capable of reducing Cl2dhbq2– to the
monoradical Cl2dhbq3–, thereby creating
a pathway for strong 2p–5f magnetic superexchange interactions
and facilitating hopping conduction between Cl2dhbq2–/•3– units. Following this hypothesis
we, herein, report on a unique example of a uranium(IV) coordination
solid constructed using quinoid-based bridging struts.

Results and Discussion
The
slow diffusion of an aqueous solution of Cl2dhbqH2 into an aqueous suspension of uranium(IV) sulfate tetrahydrate
yielded a black, crystalline material after several weeks. Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the solid to be a three-dimensional
polymeric structure, isostructural to the Th(IV) analogue reported
by Robson and co-workers,28 with the stoichiometry
of [U(Cl2dhbq)2(H2O)2]·4H2O (1). X-ray powder diffractometry (see Figure S1) and elemental analysis confirm the
homogeneity of the material and the absence of any traces of unreacted
starting materials. The local coordination environment around the
crystallographically unique uranium center is shown in Figure 2 (left) and
selected structural metrics are provided in the figure caption. The
structure comprises a ten-coordinate uranium center bridged to adjacent
uranium centers through four Cl2dhbqn– ligands, which coordinate to each uranium center in
a bidentate fashion (Figure 2). The coordination sphere is completed by two water molecules
which are hydrogen-bonded to cocrystallized water molecules (Figure S2). The C2/c crystallographic space group generates triangular pores perpendicular
to the [1, 0, −1] crystallographic plane as depicted in Figure 2 (right). Heating
of polycrystalline 1 initially leads to loss of six water
molecules as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S3) and a concurrent loss of crystallinity.
Likewise, N2-sorption measurements of polycrystalline 1 activated in vacuo at 80 °C reveal no permanent porosity.
The structure features two crystallographically distinct Cl2dhbqn– ligands, as shown in Figure 2 (left). The C1–C2
(1.552(2) Å) and C3–C4 (1.531(4) Å) bond lengths
are in the normal range for Cl2dhbq2– and significantly longer than the values previously found for Cl2dhbq•3– (e.g,. 1.456(3) Å in
[(TPyA)CoIII(Cl2dhbq•3–)CoIII(TPyA)]3+; TPyA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)-amine).33 Similarly, the C–O bonds are all in the
range of 1.258(3) to 1.267(4) Å, which are far from the 1.312(2)
Å found in [(TPyA)CoIII(Cl2dhbq•3–)CoIII(TPyA)]3+. Further comparison to the
bond lengths of the Th(IV) analogue reveals only little differences
with an average Th–O bond length of 2.50 Å versus 2.47
Å in 1, and an average O–C bond length in the
compound of 1.26 Å versus 1.26 Å in 1.28 Analysis of a crystal at T = 285 K reveals only a small thermal expansion of the unit cell
(coefficient of thermal expansion = 1.6 × 10–4 K–1, Table S1) as compared
to the 120 K data set. In conclusion, the structural analysis of 1 suggests the absence of any valence tautomerism and a formulation
of 1 based on U(IV) and closed-shell Cl2dhbq2–. Mixed-valency systems commonly exhibit intense intervalence
charge transfer (IVCT) transitions in the near-infrared energy regime.
For Cl2dhbqn–-based
coordination solids, these transitions are attributed to the interconversion
of Cl2dhbq2– and Cl2dhbq•3–.23 The near-infrared
absorption spectra of 1 reveal the absence of any IVCT
bands between 4000 and 10 000 cm–1 (see Figure S4), suggesting an absence of any organic
mixed-valency in 1. Likewise, the pressed pellet electrical
resistance of 1 exceeds several megaohm at room temperature,
reflecting its highly insulating nature. To corroborate the oxidation
state assignment, the magnetic moment of 1 was measured
as a function of temperature and magnetic field (Figures 3 and S5). The room temperature value of the magnetic susceptibility-temperature
product (χT) amounts to 0.62 cm3 K mol–1. This value is significantly lower than
the one calculated for the Russell-Saunders 3H4 (5f2, gJ = 4/5) term of 1.60
cm3 K mol–1. The magnetic moment of uranium-based
complexes has been shown to be diagnostic of the oxidation state.34 However, the room temperature magnetic moments
are broadly distributed around 0.96 cm3 K mol–1 and show overlap with the corresponding values for both U(III) and
U(V). Upon descending temperature, the χT product
gradually decreases to withdraw (∼6 × 10–3 cm3 K mol–1) at 2 K. The vanishing
χT product suggests the presence of a nonmagnetic
ground state, which is commonly encountered in U(IV), and is thus
not expected to arise from antiferromagnetic U(IV)–U(IV) interactions.
Recently, Arnold and co-workers reported the first examples of dinuclear
U(IV) complexes bridged by quinoid ligands.35 Their experimental and theoretical investigations revealed
a complete irrelevance of superexchange interactions across closed-shell
quinoids bridging two U(IV) centers. The low-temperature magnetic
field dependence of the magnetization of 1 is shown in Figure 3 (right panel). The
approximately linear behavior of M versus μ0H is reminiscent of a nonmagnetic ground
state with a significant contribution from temperature-independent
paramagnetism. This conclusion is supported by X-band electron paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopy where no resonances could be observed between
room temperature and liquid N2-temperature, suggesting
a complete absence of any Cl2dhbq•3– radical species in 1 (Figure S6).

Conclusions
We have reported the
synthesis and structural characterization
of a rare example of a uranium-based MOF not built on uranyl(VI)-nodes.
Analysis of the structural, spectroscopic, and magnetic data suggest
the presence of uranium in oxidation state +IV, despite the company
of reducible Cl2dhbq2– bridging ligands.
It is tempting to speculate that, irrespective of the favorable redox
potentials of U(IV), the absence of strong uranium–ligand covalency
may impede the metal–ligand electron-transfer mechanism found
in a plethora of 3d transition metal ion analogues. These initial
results may thus encourage further interest in the synthesis and characterization
of actinide coordination solids based on redox-active ligands, with
the ultimate goal of authenticating strong magnetic superexchange
interactions and electronic conductivity.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Instrumentation
Warning: Depleted uranium
(primarily 238U, t1/2 = 4.5
× 109 y) is a weak α-emitter
and its chemical compounds are toxic. All manipulations were done
in ventilated fume hoods at ambient conditions. U(SO4)2·xH2O was synthesized following
the procedure reported by Peres et al.36 The x = 4 formulation was determined by powder
X-ray diffraction analysis (see Figure S7). 2,5-Dichloro-3,5-dihydroxybenzoquinone was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used as received. Elemental analyses were performed on a Thermo
Scientific FlashSmart CHNS/O Elemental Analyzer. The magnetization
and electrical conductivity data were obtained on a QuantumDesign
DynaCool Physical Property Measurement System equipped with a vibrating
sample magnetometer and a 9 T dc magnet. The sample was immobilized
in a standard QuantumDesign powder capsule attached to a brass sample
holder. The magnetization was measured as a function of temperature
(1.8–300 K) and field (0–9 T) and the data were corrected
for diamagnetic contributions from the sample holder and the sample.
The MIR and NIR attenuated-total-reflectance (ATR) spectra were collected
by a Bruker VERTEX80v Fourier transform vacuum spectrometer employing
a single-reflection diamond ATR accessory. The apparatus was configured
with KBr (MIR)/CaF2 (NIR) beam splitters, liquid-nitrogen-cooled
HgCdTe (MIR)/InSb (NIR) detectors, and globar (MIR)/tungsten (NIR)
radiation sources. Extended ATR corrections were applied to account
for the wavelength-dependent penetration depth of the probe beams.
The complementary MIR Fourier transform Raman spectrum was collected
by a Bruker RAM II module employing a 1000 mW near-infrared Nd:YAG
excitation laser (1064 nm) and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled Ge detector.
A Mettler-Toledo thermogravimetric analyzer equipped with a built-in
calibration weight was used to obtain data in the temperature range
25–465 °C with a ramping speed of 0.5 °C min–1.

Synthesis
An aqueous solution of
2,5-dichloro-3,6-dihydroxybenzoquinone
(16 mg, 0.076 mmol) was carefully layered on top of an aqueous suspension
(6.5 mL) of uranium(IV) sulfate tetrahydrate (32 mg, 0.064 mmol) in
a borosilicate vial (⌀ 20 mm). The vial was sealed and left
undisturbed for 2 weeks at room temperature. The highly crystalline,
black material was isolated by filtration. Yield: ∼50%. Anal.
Calcd (found) for C12H12Cl4O14U: C, 19.0% (18.9%); H, 1.6% (1.81%). Characteristic Raman
shifts (cm–1): 292, 389, 738, 1217, 1300, 1382 (cf. Figure S8). Characteristic IR frequencies (cm–1): 444, 571, 609, 855, 1002, 1250, 1356, 1471 (cf. Figure S8).

X-ray Diffraction
Single crystals of 1 were selected and mounted on nylon
loops on a SuperNova dual source
CCD-diffractometer. The crystal was kept at 120 K during data collection.
Using Olex2,37 the structure was solved
by direct methods using the SIR200438 structure
solution program and refined by Least Squares using version 2014/7
of ShelXL (Table 1).39 All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
Hydrogen atom positions were calculated geometrically and refined
using the riding model. The X-ray powder patterns were measured on
a Huber G670 powder diffractometer using Cu Kα1 (λ
= 1.5406 Å, quartz monochromator) radiation .
