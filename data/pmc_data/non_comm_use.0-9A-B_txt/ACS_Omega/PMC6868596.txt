Using
emergent highly proficient and inexpensive non-noble metal-based
bifunctional electrocatalysts to overall water splitting reaction
is a pleasingly optional approach to resolve greenhouse gases and
energy anxiety. In this work, oleylamine-functionalized graphene oxide/Cu2ZnSnS4 composite (OAm-GO/CZTS) is prepared and
investigated as a higher bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The
OAm-GO/CZTS shows brilliant electrocatalytic performance and durability
toward H2 and O2 in both acidic and basic media,
with overpotentials of 47 mV for HER and 1.36 V for OER at a current
density of 10 mA cm–2 and Tafel slopes of 64 and
91 mV dec–1, respectively, which are extremely higher
to those of transition metal chalcogenide and as good as of commercial
precious-metal catalysts.

1 Introduction
Intensification
requirement of fossil fuels, the exhaustion of
nonrenewable energy sources and ecological pollution have led to immediate
requirement for economical, environmentally friendly, and highly developed
energy production and storage systems.1 Electrochemical water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is broadly
considered to be a critical step for remarkable nonconventional energy
production, storage, and convention. To date, the best catalysts are
still mainly from Noble metals Ir or Ru for the oxygen evolution reaction
(OER)2 and Pt for the hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER).3 Nevertheless, expensive
metals rarely fulfill the requirements of large-scale consumption
because of their shortage and costly. Intensive study is accordingly
conducted to develop inexpensive and high-efficiency electrocatalysts
that have comparable activity to precious electrocatalysts. In the
times of yore, metal complexes,4 heteroatom-doped,5 metal alloys,6 double-layered
hydroxide,7 metal phosphides,8 hybrid nano–bio electrocatalysts,9 polymer-embedded catalyst,10 transition metals,11 metal-free
electrocatalyst,12 metal–carbon
heterostructures,13 amine-functionalized
electrocatalysts,12c and many more potential
electrode materials have been investigated for H2- and
O2-evolution reactions.14

Consequently, different approaches have been scrutinized to further
fine-tune HER and OER activities of electrocatalysts: first, manufacturing
of higher surface areas and earth-abundant nanostructures.15 Second, doping is one of the scalable strategies
that further improve the electrocatalytic activity of the electrocatalyst
because of their abundant defects and enhanced number of the catalytic
active sites. For example, pure MoS2 consists of inferior
electrocatalytic activity than that of Ni-doped MoS2 electrocatalyst
toward water splitting reaction.16 Fe incorporates
in MoP give an electrocatalytic performance than bare MoP,17 and Co-doped CZTS enhanced their electrocatalytic
activity than pure CZTS.18 Third, heteroatom-doped
materials are admired in the research areas of water-splitting reaction
because of its abundant active sites and superb electrical properties.
N/Co-doped PCP/NRGO demonstrated superior electrocatalytic performance
when N/Co-doped PCP merges with NRGO sheets to form a hybrid, which
is a valuable strategy to integrate their relevant virtues and improve
the overall catalytic performance;19 the
Ni2P/NRGO hybrid displayed an improved catalytic activity
with a small Tafel slope (59 mV dec–1) and minute
overpotential 37 mV than the Ni2P/RGO hybrid catalyst;20 and the amorphous Co–Ni–B electrocatalyst
shows higher electrocatalytic performance toward HER in a wide range
of pH.21 Fourth, layered double hydroxides
(LDHs), as a class of ionic lamellar compounds made up of positively
charged brucite-like layers with an interlayer area including charge-balancing
anions and solvation molecules. Co intake LDH ultrathin nanosheets
show superior OER activity with small overpotentials and lesser Tafel
slopes.22 Fifth, extremely high electrically
conductive materials, such as graphene oxide (GO),23 can further increase the electrocatalytic activities of
catalysts for water-splitting reaction,24 thereby exposing more active sites for facilitating fast electron
transport. For instance, MoS2/rGO and MoSe2/rGO
composites exhibit a large number of catalytic edge sites plus their
outstanding HER activity.25 Three-dimensional
CoS2 and CoSe2/graphene hybrid heterostructures
are excellent HER catalysts.26 So far,
this strategy has actually improved the catalytic performances of
the electrocatalyst, but the majority of them still have no comparison
to the noble-metal Pt electrocatalyst.27 Consequently, it is still well enviable and crucial to the formation
of the electrocatalyst as compared to the Pt-like electrocatalyst.
In our earlier work, we testify that the GO/CZTS composite further
enhances the electrocatalytic activity of CZTS; here, functionalization
of graphene with amine (electron-donating groups) might be a promising
approach to get better electrical conductivity of graphene.28

Herein, we developed an oleylamine-functionalized
GO/CZTS composite
(OAm-GO/CZTS) which further enhances the electrocatalytic performance
toward water-splitting reaction (mutual aid H2 and O2) compared to GO/CZTS. The results undoubtedly suggest that
the introduction of electron-donating functional groups could significantly
improve the catalytic activities and prospect a further avenue toward
scheming very capable catalysts for water splitting with enormous
potentials to substitute the precious Pt-based catalysts. The key
advantage of oleylamine (OAm) over other amines is its ability to
act as many different agents, including high boiling point, viscous
solvent, reducing agent, and coordinating ligand via the terminal
amine.29 The OAm-GO/CZTS electrocatalyst
exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity with a minor Tafel slope
of 64 and 91 mV dec–1 and a small overpotential
of 47 mV and 1.11 V at 10 mA cm–2 obtained toward
HER and OER, respectively. This effort not only presents a low cost,
earth-abundant, and well-active electrocatalyst but also unlock a
fresh research pathway toward the development of HER and OER catalytic
activity in general.

2 Instruments
To identify
the organic and inorganic components in the sample,
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometric (400–4000 cm–1) studies on a Bruker TENSOR 27 FT-IR spectrometer
were carried out. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy for the purpose
used phase and structure analysis by a Siemens D-5005 diffractometer
equipped with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα; λ = 1.5418 nm, 40
kV, 30 mA, with a step size of 0.01°). An equivalent Raman spectrum
was obtained by Raman optics with a microscope, Seki Technotron Corp.,
Tokyo, with 532 nm laser. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area calculation of OAm-GO/CZTS and all necessary sample
analysis by N2 adsorption at 77 K isotherms at 77.350 K
was performed using a Quantachrome NovaWin 1994-2012, Quantachrome
Instruments v11.02. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
study was conducted using the Nova NanoSEM NPEP303 and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) instrument for examining the morphologies
and sizes of the products.

3 Electrochemical Measurements
Electrocatalytic potential investigation studies were carried out
using CHI Instrument 660E (USA) electrochemical workstation under
room temperature. A typical three-electrode system consist of a reference
electrode as a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), a working electrode
as a glassy carbon electrode (GCE is 3.0 mm in dia.), and a counter
electrode as a platinum wire for overall water splitting reaction.
Before the GCE is used for an experiment, it makes mirror polished,
by using alumina powders, in the order of 1, 0.3, and 0.05 μm
and cleaned at the same time by using water and methanol to remove
inorganic and organic impurities concurrently. For the manufacture
of the working electrode, the active area of the electrode was coated
with a calculated amount of a thin layer of the catalyst, which was
prepared by ultrasonic mixing of 5.0 mg of the as-synthesized catalyst
with 300 μL of isopropanol and 10 μL of Nafion solution
for 1/2 h in order to form a uniform slurry. Then, 10 μL of
the prepared slurry was loaded onto the surface of a GCE using a micropipette
and dried at room temperature. All the potentials were carried out
with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.5 M H2SO4E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 0.244 V, in 1.0 M KOH, E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 1.051 V, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) analysis carried out from 1 000 000 to 0.002 Hz
at a direct-current bias potential of 47 mV for HER and 1.11 V for
OER, respectively, at room temperature.

4 Result
and Discussion
Figure 1a demonstrated
FT-IR spectra of GO, OAm, pure CZTS, OAm-GO, GO/CZTS composite, OAm-CZTS,
and OAm-GO/CZTS over the range of 400–4000 cm–1. The characteristic bands of GO are observed at 1025 cm–1 (C–O–C stretching vibrations of epoxy groups), 1406
cm–1 (C–OH stretching), 1615 cm–1 (C=C skeleton vibrations of graphitic domains), 1725 cm–1 (C=O stretching vibrations of COOH groups),
and 3442 cm–1 (−OH bending vibration.30 The FTIR spectra of OAm shows absorption peaks
at 720, 967, 1070, 1466, 1592, 1650, 2850, and 3003 cm–1, respectively. The FTIR absorption peak of OAm at 720 cm–1 corresponds to the (C–C) bond. The carbon-nitrogen (C–N)
stretching vibrations (1070 cm–1) and nitrogen hydrogen
bending vibrations (967 cm–1) of amine (NH2) group in OAm were unchanged. The absorption peak at 1465 and 1593
cm–1 corresponds to the bending of the CH3 and NH2 group in OAm. The band at 2850 cm–1 is for symmetric C–H stretching and 2920 cm–1 for asymmetric C–H stretching and the main band 3312 cm–1 is corresponding to the primary amine NH2 group of OAm, which is in good agreement with the reported literature.31 The distinctive functional groups of CZTS were
located in 1040, 1420, 1622, and 2351 cm–1 corresponding
to the C−S stretching, coupled vibrations of C−N stretching,
and N–H bending, S–H thiol functionalities, respectively,
which is in concurrence with the literature ideals.32,33 In the OAm-GO FTIR spectra, vanishing of the peak of the carboxyl
group on the GO surface at 1725 cm–1 peak of the
amine group on OAm at 3312 cm–1 stretching vibration
can be observed, and the appearance of the peak of the N–H
stretching vibration at 1552 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum
of OAm confirms that the successful functionalization with GO (OAm-GO)
were attributed to the covalent bonding between amine groups of OAm
and carboxyl groups of GO. On the other hand, the above-assigned peaks
of CZTS were also observed in the GO/CZTS composites, with reduced
intensity, which indicates that the oxygenated functional groups in
GO were reduced partially. For the comparative studies, characteristic
peaks obtained at 3311 cm–1 amines (NH2), 2854, and 2924 cm–1 (symmetric and asymmetric
stretching C–H) are observed from plane OAm and the peak at
1040, 1420, and 1622 cm–1 equivalent to the C−S
stretching, coupled vibrations of C−N stretching, and N–H
bending of CZTS. In the case of OAm-GO/CZTS, the broad FTIR peak at
3438 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching of adsorbed
water molecules and structural O–H groups (such as alcohol
and carboxylic acid) from GO and peaks at 1565 cm–1 equivalent to amine bond (NH2). The intensity of every
peak attributed to oxygen functional groups is remarkably reduced,
representing that most of the GO oxygen group is reduced or substituted
with amino groups during the functionalization. Hence, FTIR analysis
confirms the amine functionalization of the GO/CZTS composite.34

4.1 X-ray
Diffraction
Figure 1b shows the superimposed XRD
patterns of GO, OAm-f-GO, pure CZTS, OAm-CZTS, GO/CZTS composite,
and OAm-GO/CZTS. The XRD pattern of GO represents a distinct small
peak at (002) corresponding to few-layer graphene.5 Accordingly, the pattern for OAm-f-GO illustrates the interplanar
spacing is slightly increased after surface functionalization of GO
by OAm performing as a spacer and increases interplanar distances.
It is apparent that the pure CZTS XRD patterns shown are the characteristic
peaks at (112), (200), (220), and (312) crystal planes of the kesterite
structure of CZTS (JCPDS card no: 26-0575).35 Then, OAm-CZTS showed similar XRD patterns of pure CZTS, and except
for their peak broadening, there is no any additional peaks observed.
GO/CZTS composites possess the XRD pattern, the peaks observed at
(002), (112), (200), (220), and (312) correspond to the diffraction
planes of mixed GO and CZTS. However, OAm-GO/CZTS shows four pronounced
diffraction planes at (112), (200), (220), and (312) of CZTS and (002)
plane of GO, respectively, which shows that the functionalization
of amine does not much affect the crystal structure of the GO/CZTS
composite and OAm species is not observed. The broadened peaks indicate
that the crystallite size of the OAm-GO/CZTS composite is relatively
small.

4.2 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy
was executed on GO, CZTS, composite GO/CZTS, and OAm-GO/CZTS, and
the outcome is shown in Figure 1c. In the Raman profile of GO, the typical D and G bands are
allocated to the k-point phonons of the A1g symmetry and E2g phonon of the sp2 carbon
at 1360 and 1594 cm–1, respectively.36 The characteristic peaks at 333 cm–1 were assigned to the A1 mode of CZTS NPs, which is the
toughest mode observed from kesterite CZTS.37 Intended for the GO/CZTS composite, all the Raman bands for CZTS
and GO can be found which indicates that GO/CZTS consists of GO and
CZTS. The intensity of the G band increases relatively to the D band
when CZTS NPs are deposited on graphene and both bands shift to higher
wavenumbers.36 In the present study, the
D and G bands for the OAm-GO/CZTS composite appeared at 1360 and 1594
cm–1 and the CZTS peak was observed at 333 cm–1, respectively. Therefore, the intensity ratio of ID/IG gives straight
confirmation of the degree of functionalization and the ID/IG ratio of pure GO is 0.83,
then ID/IG ratio of GO/CZTS and OAm-GO/CZTS was increased from 0.38 to 0.435,
following OAm functionalization. This consequence also visibly signifies
that the amine functional group was covalently bonded against the
surface of GO after surface functionalization. The XRD patterns accompanied
by Raman spectra all demonstrated the fact that the OAm-GO/CZTS composite
material was obtained without any other extraneous species.

4.3 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
The BET surface
area for pure CZTS, GO/CZTS, GO, and OAm-GO/CZTS
was surveyed using typical N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms. As shown in Figure 1d the special BET surface area of GO, CZTS, and GO/CZTS electrocatalytic
systems is 41.7, 2.016, and 24.016 m2 g–1, which is significantly lower than OAm-GO/CZTS (50.716 m2 g–1), and this could be due to the presence of
amine groups and conductive graphene with a huge surface area. The
enhanced specific surface area supplies efficient transport pathways
for charged ions and increases the electrode–electrolyte interfacial
area, which is favorable for the improvement of electrochemical performance
of the composite.

4.4 Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscopy
Figure 2a–c
illustrate the surface morphologies of pure CZTS NPs, GO sheets, and
OAm-GO/CZTS examined by FE-SEM. In Figure 2a, the layered structure of the stacked GO
sheets can be seen, and there are many wrinkles through all the surfaces
of GO sheets.38 The solid GO sample is
severely agglomerated because of its high specific surface area. Figure 2b shows an FE-SEM
image of CZTS nanoparticles that were mainly of the spherical shape,
with an average size diameter of 100–200 nm. The diameter was
determined by averaged measurements of around 50 particles in the
FE-SEM images. Uniform CZTS nanospheres are obtained by small aggregation.39Figure 2c after amine functionalization and careful inspection of
the FE-SEM images of OAm-GO/CZTS revealed an average size diameter
of 200–250 nm, and the size increases compared to CZTS because
of the higher size of GO. When adding together, it can be evidently
examined that CZTS was well dispersed in the graphene structure with
no obvious aggregation, and the majority of these CZTS nanospheres
were wrapped with graphene nanosheets.36 Additionally, the high-resolution TEM image of OAm-GO/CZTS is shown
in Figure S1, and it clearly shows that
after amine functionalization, CZTS particles were enfolded in graphene
sheets, which is reliable with the examination from FE-SEM images
of OAm-GO/CZTS.

4.5 Electrocatalytic Activities toward HER
The performance of the electrocatalyst of all the samples toward
the HER was estimated on three set up systems, using a SCE as the
reference electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode, and GCE
as the working electrode, in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution
at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. Figure 3a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV)
polarization curves of Pt, pristine GO, OAm-GO, pure CZTS, OAm-CZTS,
GO/CZTS, and OAm-GO/CZTS at the scan rate of 50 mV s–1. As control experiments, the electrochemical performances of the
commercial Pt electrode and pure GO were also investigated for comparison.
Obviously, the Pt electrode demonstrates the lowest overpotential,
representing the highest electrocatalytic activity for HER,40 while the pure GO electrode exhibits insignificant
activity toward the HER. Figure 3a shows significantly that OAm-GO/CZTS exhibits the
onset overpotential of 47 and 96.6 mV to afford current densities
of 10 and 20 mA cm–2, respectively, lower than the
earlier-reported HER catalytic systems under given conditions,41 demonstrating that OAm-GO (546 mV), pure CZTS
(435 mV), OAm-CZTS (389 mV), and GO/CZTS composite (208 mV) at 10
mA cm–2 exhibit inferior HER activities as compared
to the OAm-GO/CZTS electrocatalyst. However, improved electrochemical
performance on OAm-GO/CZTS composites can be attributed to the chemical
and electronic coupling between OAm and CZTS/GO support, and this
result makes us consider that the presence of the amine group plays
a noteworthy task in the superior electrocatalytic activity and also
graphene can perform as an ideal conductive additive because of its
distinctive electrical properties.42 Besides,
the Tafel slope is playing a vital role for analyzing HER activity,
and a lesser Tafel slope leads to a faster augmentation of HER rate
with increasing overpotential. The linear portions of the Tafel plots
were fitted by the Tafel equation (η = b log j + a, where, j is the
current density and b is the Tafel slope), in Figure 3b. The Pt Tafel value
is superior, that is, 36 mV dec–1 which means it
is smaller than the exhibited OAm-GO/CZTS Tafel slope value of 64
mV dec–1.43 while it
is much lower than that of OAm-GO (115 mV dec–1),
pure CZTS (85 mV dec–1), OAm-CZTS (83 mV dec–1), and for GO/CZTS (81 mV dec–1)
which is in good agreement with previous literature values for the
nonprecious transition-metal HER electrocatalyst, such as MoS2,13c MoS2CFs,44 and bare CoS2.45 More comparison of the OAm-GO/CZTS composite with other
electrocatalyst is listed in (Table S1).
OAm-GO/CZTS is obtained with the exchange current density (j0) being 988 mA cm–2 for the
HER, which is superior to GO/CZTS composites (884 mA cm–2) and also outperforming that of many reported non-noble metal HER
catalysts.46 These results suggest that
the OAm-GO/CZTS could be used as an efficient electrocatalyst for
the HER and are shown in Figure S2, which
shows scan rate-dependant LSV polarization curve from 10 to 100 mV
s–1. It can be seen that the current density increases
with the increasing scan rate; it is informative that the catalytic
activity of OAm-GO/CZTS toward HER is a slighter pretentious by scan
rates authenticate electron transfer reaction (HER) is diffusion-controlled.27d In addition, we use the LSV using graphite
as a counter electrode for a comparative study for the Pt counter
electrode, but there are no significant results obtained (dissolution
and reductive deposition of Pt on the cathode) see in Figure S3.

test of OAm-GO/CZTS (inset of d) shows the i–t chronoamperometry test for 1000 min in 0.5 M H2SO4.

To understand the role
of electrode kinetics and interface reaction
of OAm-GO/CZTS and its GO/CZTS composites on HER to perform the EIS
measurement, Nyquist plots presented in Figure 3c is observed to be semicircle which is due
to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode and electrolyte interface. From the EIS, it has
been observed that the GO/CZTS (23 Ω), OAm-CZTS (37 Ω),
OAm-GO (50 Ω), and GO (78 Ω) show higher Rct values compared to OAm-GO/CZTS; herein, the charge
transfer resistance (Rct) of OAm-GO/CZTS
is 5 Ω which results in better enhancement in the electron transfer
process after amine functionalization, which leads to the enhancement
of HER activity.25b,47 We further ensure the catalytic
strength of OAm-GO/CZTS in the 0.5 M H2SO4 solution
to exhibit the possibility of its practical application. The polarization
curves of OAm-GO/CZTS in Figure 3d show an insignificant loss of it’s HER catalytic
activity after 1000 CV cycles. In addition, the chronopotentiometric
curve in the inset of Figure 3d shows that the OAm-GO/CZTS could deliver a stable current
density at the overpotential of 47 mV up to 1000 min with negligible
degradation. These results undoubtedly display the excellent durability
of the OAm-GO/CZTS under the HER condition.27d,46b,48 The turnover frequency (TOF)
of H2 molecules evolved per second (symbolize as units
of s–1) for each active site was deliberate. The
TOF can be intended by the Jaramillo’s method.27d,48,49 For this direct site-to-site
evaluation, a contrast to other catalysts except for platinum (Pt),
the OAm-GO/CZTS catalyst shows the uppermost TOF value of 3.673 s–1 at η = 250 mV, indicating a tremendous intrinsic
HER activity which should be credited to the conductive GO that imparts
CZTS with rapid electron transfer in the HER. Moreover, the GO sheets
with a high specific surface area act as a superior supporter for
the electrocatalyst, which is also essential for enhancing the active
sites. TOF is the number of hydrogen molecules generated in each active
site per second (see the Supporting Information for details of calculations). More detailed comparison of other
electrocatalysts is shown in Table S1.

4.6 Electrocatalytic Activities toward OER
Electrocatalytic studies also show that the synthesized catalysts
also possess prominent OER performance measured by LSV in basic electrolyte
(1.0 M KOH) solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 at room temperature and is shown in Figure 4a. Surprisingly, OAm-GO/CZTS exhibits a low
overpotential of η = 1.36 V at 10 mA cm–2,
and the observed overpotential for OER is one of the lowest that has
been witnessed till date, also lesser than GO/CZTS (1.61 V), OAm-CZTS
(1.80 V), pure CZTS (1.85 V), OAm-GO (2.30 V), and GO (2.46 V) appraisal
listed in (Table S2) and the resulting
Tafel slope of OAm-GO/CZTS is 91 mV dec–1 in Figure 4b. This is the lowest
among those of electrocatalysts OAm-GO (160 mV dec–1), CZTS (144 mV dec–1) OAm-CZTS (142 mV dec–1), and GO/CZTS for (140 mV dec–1). These results reveal that OAm-GO/CZTS shows excellent electrocatalytic
properties over the other catalysts and even newly reported OER-based
catalysts.16,50 Furthermore, the semicircular
diameter is shown in Figure 4c. The OAm-GO/CZTS (Rct = 76 Ω)
is much inferior to GO/CZTS (Rct = 125
Ω), OAm-CZTS (Rct = 155 Ω),
CZTS (Rct = 200 Ω), OAm-GO (Rct = 150 Ω), and GO (Rct = 398 Ω) because of lower electron transfer resistance
in alkaline solution. The OAm-GO/CZTS possesses superb durability
in the alkaline electrolyte as shown in Figure 4d. Even after continuous 1000 cycling, the
OAm-GO/CZTS catalyst presents a similar polarization curve and original
appearance. This result is fabulous than other OER electrocatalysts.51 The chronoamperometric (CA) test for 1000 min
is shown in the inset of Figure 4d, and it confirms the superb stability performance
of OAm-GO/CZTS with negligible loss of anodic current in the alkaline
electrolyte.

Figure S4 shows that
scan rate-dependent
LSV performance of OAm-GO/CZTS toward OER in the resultant current
density increases with increasing scan rate from 10 to 100 mV s–1, revealing that the electrocatalytic activity of
the catalyst which is small is affected by scan rates. That is, superior
HER and OER performance of the proposed OAm-GO/CZTS electrocatalyst
is essentially ascribed to the following reasons:First, the amine
functionalization plays an important role in the enhanced catalytic
activity where the lower |ΔGH*| value of the
amine group increases the electron transferability of GO, which is
beneficial for water-splitting reaction. Second, the OAm-GO/CZTS electrocatalyst
has a huge specific surface area and supports the mass transfer of
ions in the electrolyte from GO that enhances HER catalytic performance.
Third, the outstanding OER performance is initiated after oxidation
and OAm functionalization of graphene; the graphene surface contains
many amino groups and oxygen atoms, which present a greater catalysis
activity for OER performance. Fourth, electronic coupling to the fundamental
GO consistent conducting system provided speedy electron transport
from the highly resistive CZTS NPs to the electrodes. To analyze this
result, we verified electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS)
measurements. Thus, the fast charge transfer during the electrocatalytic
reaction, unchanging with a large exposed active surface area, could
have donated to the higher electrocatalytic activity of the OAm-GO/CZTS.
Fifth, synergetic interaction between transition-metal chalcogenide
(CZTS) and conducting GO composite hasten charge transfer and benefit
fast dispersion and reaction at the electrolyte–electrode interface.
Above rationalization indicates that OAm-GO/CZTS is a capable and
stable bifunctional overall water-splitting electrocatalyst. In short,
the electrochemical performance of OAm-GO/CZTS is given from the OAm-GO
co-catalyst supported by the surface of CZTS. On the one hand, the
amine group raises the electron transferability of GO and on the other
hand, electrically conductive GO sheets as a skeleton facilitate the
electron transfer to the CZTS catalyst; this work paves a new path
for exploring efficient bifunctional water-splitting catalysts; see Scheme 1.

5 Conclusions
In summary, we prepared
an OAm-GO/CZTS composite that exhibits
high electrocatalytic activity toward overall water-splitting (HER
and OER) reactions; the composite was obtained by the wrapping of
GO on CZTS by an electrostatic reaction and the grafting of OAm via
interaction with carboxylic groups on GO. Amine-functionalized graphene
played a noteworthy role in enhancing H2 and O2 performance. The intimate contact of amine-functionalized graphene
with CZTS enhanced charge transfer, resulting in a small Tafel slope
of 64 mV dec–1 for HER and 91 mV dec–1 for OER with small overpotential of just about 47 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 for the HER and 1.36 V in 1 M KOH for the OER,
respectively, as well as superb stability of 1000 min for overall
water splitting. We expect that amine-functionalized graphene does
not only report a cost-effective catalyst for the water-splitting
in both HER and OER. A similar approach is also applicable to propose
the other catalysts with high efficiency.

6 Experimental
Section
6.1 Chemicals and Materials
Graphite
fine powder (extra pure), sulphuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), nitric acid (HNO3, 78%), hydrochloric acid (HCl,
98%), thionyl chloride (SOCl2), copper chloride (CuCl2·2H2O, 98%), zinc chloride (ZnCl2·2H2O, 96%), tin chloride (SnCl2·2H2O, 98%), thioacetamide, 2-methoxyethanol, OAm, monoethanolamine,
and absolute ethanol of the AR grade were used for sonication. All
the chemicals were procured from Sigma-Aldrich and were used without
any further purification.

6.2 Preparation of GO
GO produced by
a modified Hummers’ method is reported in the previous article.52 In detail, 1 g of graphite powder as the graphene
source was added in H2SO4/HNO3 typically
in a 3:1 ratio of under continuous stirring in an ice bath for 30
min and sonicated at room temperature further for 6 h. The suspension
was refluxed in an oil bath for the next 24 h. The combination was
then frequently centrifuged and washed successively with water to
remove surplus nitric acid and sulphuric acid. Finally, it was washed
with 30% HCl to keep surface acid functionalities, followed by water
and acetone. The filtered residue was dried in an oven at 200 °C
for next 3–4 h.

6.3 Synthesis of CZTS Nanoparticles
The
CZTS nanoparticles were synthesized by the sonochemical method described
in our previous report.53

6.4 Synthesis of Amine Functionalization OAm-GO/CZTS
Composite
Further, for the synthesis of OAm-GO/CZTS, 200
mg of as-synthesized GO was taken in a round-bottom flask and 20 mL
of SOCl2 followed by 1 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) was
mixed in the cold condition, and this mixture was stirred for 1 h
followed by reflux for the next 24 h. For additional functionalization
by OAm, 20 mg of above G-COCl and 10 mL of OAm were mixed in 20 mL
of DMF and this solution was sonicated for the next 4 h. In this OAm-GO
solution, 200 mg of CZTS NPs was added and sonicated further for 2
h at room temperature. The obtained product was washed two times with
ethanol to remove other impurities. Collected OAm-GO/CZTS annealed
at 170 °C for 1 h. In this step, the amine group of OAm reacts
with the carboxylic group of GO. The resulting amine-functionalized
GO CZTS (OAm-GO/CZTS) consisted of CZTS nanoparticles coated with
amine-functionalized GO. The overall procedure for fabricating OAm-GO/CZTS
is schematically shown in Scheme 2.
