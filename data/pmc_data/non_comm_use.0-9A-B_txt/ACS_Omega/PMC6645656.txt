The morphologies
of the microphase-separated structures in the
binary blends of diblock copolymers (AB/AB) have been studied intensively
for the case of diblock copolymers bearing antisymmetric compositions
with similar molecular weights. Here, the two diblock copolymers 1
and 2, of which compositions are 0.5 – x and
0.5 + x (0 < x < 0.5), respectively,
were blended, and the morphology diagram was constructed in the plot
of χZ vs the average composition of the A component,
where χ is the interaction parameter between A and B segments
and Z is the average degree of polymerization of
the two AB diblock copolymers. The temperature-dependent morphologies
were analyzed by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements.
It was found that the morphology diagram agrees in principle with
the theoretical one for the neat AB diblocks by Matsen and Bates (Macromolecules1996, 29, 1091–1098),
although the disordered phase was a bit expanded in the experimentally
determined morphology diagram. Anomalous temperature dependencies
in the lamellar spacing have been also comprehensively studied for
the binary blends of antisymmetric diblock copolymers as a function
of the degree of compositional asymmetry by closely adjusting the
average composition in the blend specimen at 0.50. For this purpose,
more than 20 neat diblock copolymers have been synthesized with a
wide range of compositions from 0.20 to 0.87 and a range of molecular
weight of 12 000–33 800. The temperature dependencies
of the lamellar spacing were also analyzed by synchrotron SAXS measurements.
As a result, the following things were found. The scaling exponent
α in D ∼ Tα was still negative but slightly larger than the usual value (i.e.,
α = −0.33) for the smaller degree of asymmetry in the
composition (i.e., x is small), while α became
positive for the higher degree of asymmetry. The latter result is
very anomalous because the temperature dependence is opposite (i.e.,
the lamellar spacing increases with an increase of temperature). The
value of α was found to be linearly rationalized with the degree
of asymmetry τ (which is especially introduced in the current
paper for this purpose), for the binary blends with the average composition
of 0.50. Based on this result, one can prepare lamellar microdomains,
of which spacing does not change with temperature, by blending two
diblock copolymers with τ = 1.33 (corresponding to 0.3 and 0.7
of compositions) having similar molecular weights. This would be important
for manufacturing materials with properties (for instance, the optical
property) independent of temperature. From the current study, the
binary blends of the antisymmetric diblock copolymers are concluded
to be versatile such that the precise controls of the morphologies
and the temperature dependencies of the lamellar microdomains are
plausible.

Introduction
Precise control of morphologies of microphase-separated
structures
requires well-defined block copolymers with monodispersity in molecular
weights and in compositions.1 However,
polymer synthesis techniques (living polymerization) and a special
chromatographic method of fractionation (two-dimensional HPLC fractionation)
are required for this purpose.2 These are
quite heavy tasks for general researchers and create a high barrier.
On the contrary, binary blends of block copolymers provide a facile
strategy of precise control of compositions. In this regard, two block
copolymers with antisymmetric compositions are preferred, although
the composition is not monodisperse for the case of the blends. Since
the blending is much easier as compared to the case of synthesizing
a well-defined neat block copolymer with the targeted composition,
mimicking a phase diagram of the microphase-separated structures has
been studied. The binary blends of diblocks, AB/AB, have been intensively
examined both experimentally and theoretically since the 1980s,3−39 not only for the purpose of the morphology control3,7,10−12,14,15,18,21,22,25,33 but also for
many other aspects, such as elucidation of the cosurfactant effects
(mixtures of small amounts of short diblocks in the long diblocks),3−5,8,9,13,16,17,26,28−31,33,35,36,38 anomalous
temperature behavior of the domain spacing,11,19,24,27,29,31,35,39 elucidation of the effects of
cast solvent on the morphology in thin films,32,34 and examination of the grain boundary structure between the macroscopically
phase-separated grains of thick and thin lamellae.6 For these many purposes, a variety of AB/AB binary blends
have been examined, such as [long symmetric AB]/[short symmetric AB]
blends,3−6,8,9,13,16,17,26,29,36 [long asymmetric AB]/[short symmetric
AB] blends,14,24,28,30,31,35,38 [asymmetric AB]/[symmetric
AB] blends (with similar molecular weights),15,25 and antisymmetric AB/AB blends (with similar molecular weights).7,10−12,18−23,27,32−34,37,39 Furthermore, binary blends of AB/ABA3,40−44 and ABA/ABA45−47 have attracted interest from the viewpoint of mechanical
properties because the ABA triblock copolymers possess good elastomeric
property due to the bridge conformation of the B midblock chains between
the dispersed A microdomains.40,45−47 As a matter of fact, the blends of SI/SIS are technologically applied
to adhesive materials,42−44 where SI and SIS denote a polystyrene-block-polyisoprene diblock copolymer and a polystyrene-block-polyisoprene-block-polystyrene triblock copolymer,
respectively. For such AB/ABA blends, the Monte Carlo simulation has
also been performed to study the microdomain structures in thin films.41 As another notable report on the miscibility
of binary blends, the miscibility between SI and SB (polystyrene-block-polybutadiene diblock copolymer) has been reported
with similar molecular weights48 but immiscibility
between SI and (SI)4 (a linear tetrablock copolymer with
similar entire molecular weights to the SI diblock).49 By noting good miscibility between SI and SIS (with similar
molecular weights of an entire polymer chain), the above-mentioned
miscibility/immiscibility results indicate a nice contrast in the
fact that the dissimilarity in chemical structures of the chain segments
does not matter, but the difference in the architecture of a polymer
chain matters to the miscibility between two block copolymers.

As for the anomalous temperature dependence of the lamellar spacing
in diblock copolymer blends, we have reported it for the first time
for lamellar microdomains formed in binary blends of antisymmetric
SI/SI of which compositions are 0.5 – x and
0.5 + x (0 < x < 0.5), respectively,
with similar molecular weights.19 That
is to say, the domain spacing (D) increased with
temperature, which is very different from the common knowledge that D decreases with temperature as D ∼ T–1/3 (T: the absolute
temperature in Kelvin)50,51 for the UCST (upper critical
solution temperature) type miscibility change with temperature; namely,
the miscibility is increased when temperature increases. Such an anomality
has been first theoretically predicted by Shi and Noolandi11 and later reported experimentally by many different groups24,27,29,31,35,39 not only for the lamellar microdomain
but also for
the bicontinuous microdomain.31 The increase
of D at high temperature has been ascribed to delocalization
(solubilization) of short diblock chains into both of the polystyrene
(PS) and polyisoprene (PI) lamellar phases, which has been evidenced
by small-angle neutron scattering for the case of a [long asymmetric
SI]/[short symmetric SI] blend.24 As for
the antisymmetric case, the delocalization mechanism would be applicable,
as pointed out by Park et al.39 However,
this process is clearly the onset of the macroscopic phase separation.
Our result previously reported19 clearly
indicated almost reversible temperature dependencies upon cooling
from the highest temperature subsequently after heating. This fact
clearly indicates that the anomalous temperature dependence cannot
be ascribed to the macroscopic phase separation process. In other
words, the anomality cannot be ascribed to delocalization (solubilization)
for the case of the antisymmetric blends.

In the current study,
we will first provide a summary of the phase
diagram by using SI/SI blends with appropriately adjusting the overall
PS average volume fraction (ϕPS) in the plot of χZ vs ϕ̅PS where χ and Z are the interaction parameter between A and B segments
and the average degree of polymerization as defined in refs (21) and (22). Actually, this is the
comprehensive version of the phase diagram as previously reported22 based on our experimental results using SI samples
with similar molecular weights, and it is compared with a theoretical
phase diagram for the antisymmetric AB/AB blend (with the same molecular
weights) by Matsen and Bates12 and with
a theoretical phase diagram for a neat diblock.1

In this study, we intend to examine the temperature
dependency
of D for the lamellar morphology. Therefore, it is
important to examine in advance whether the lamellar phase prevails
in the average composition range of 0.4–0.6 at χZ ≈ 20, as in the case of the neat diblock copolymers.
As a matter of fact, this can be clearly confirmed later (Figure 2). Thus, it is possible
to examine the temperature behaviors not only for the average PS fraction
of 0.50 but also for the case of not exactly being identical to 0.50.
Since the latter case lacks the balance of the stoichiometric numbers
of the antisymmetric AB/AB diblock chains, the latter possesses the
significance to highlight a feature of the lamellar structure comprising
stoichiometric numbers of the antisymmetric diblock copolymer chains,
as shown in Figure 1. In this sense, Figure 2 plays an important role to examine in advance
whether the lamellar morphology can be formed for the binary blend
having the average composition not exactly being identical to 0.50.

is the same as Figure 3 of ref (19) (copyright ACS).

value. The morphologies were examined by the in situ small-angle X-ray
scattering measurements. The red broken curves indicate the theoretical
morphology diagram by Matsen and Bates for the neat diblocks.1

We then examine the temperature dependence of the lamellar
spacing
in various binary blends of poly(methyl acrylate)-block-polystyrene (MS) diblock copolymers with the synchrotron small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. For this purpose, the antisymmetric
binary blends were prepared by using MS diblock copolymers 1 and 2,
with compositions of 0.5 – x and 0.5 + x (0 < x < 0.5), respectively. In
this study, more than 20 samples have been synthesized with a wide
range of compositions from 0.20 to 0.87 and the range of the molecular
weight of 12 000–33 800 (Table 1). The significant point of using the MS
specimens is that the segregation between PMA (poly(methyl acrylate);
M) and PS (S) is much larger than that for the SI specimens. Using
the following temperature dependencies of χ for the SI and the
MS segmental interaction19,63 1

and 180 °C
for SI are 0.040 and 0.036, respectively, and those for MS are 0.083
and 0.080, respectively. Thus, the ratios of the χ values are
2.06 and 2.25 for 150 and 180 °C, respectively. This means that
a lower molecular weight is required for the MS specimens to match
the segregation power χZ. As a matter of fact,
the molecular weights of the MS specimens listed in Table 1 are less than those of the
SI specimens in the literature, which reports the anomalous temperature
dependence of χ.19 Since the lower
molecular weight specimens have much lower viscosity, the required
experimental time can be reduced for the examination of the equilibrium
behavior of the temperature dependence of D, not
only in the heating process (Figure 6) but also in the multiple cycles of the heating/cooling
processes (Figure 10).

Figure 1 is
a schematic
illustration showing the concept of the packing condition of block
chains in lamellar microdomains for the case of the antisymmetric
binary blends (50/50). This kind of mutual-compensating chain packing
in the lamellar microdomains has been supported experimentally by
the neutron reflectivity measurements23 and by theoretical consideration.37 Since
we found the temperature-independent D for a particular
case of the antisymmetric blend of diblock copolymers, it would be
important for manufacturing materials with properties (for instance,
the optical property) independent of temperature. Actually, based
on our experimental results, one can prepare lamellar microdomains
for which spacing does not change with temperature by blending two
diblock copolymers.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2 is the
result of the morphology diagram in the weak-segregation limit for
the binary blends of SI diblock copolymers SIZ-3 and SIZ-4. Figure 2 also compares our
experimental results with the theoretical result of Matsen and Bates
for the neat diblocks,1 as indicated with
red broken curves. It is noted here that Matsen and Bates have reported
the morphology diagram for the antisymmetric AB/AB blend with 0.25/0.75
of the compositions,12 which should be
more appropriate for comparison with our experimental results. However,
their theoretical result (Figure 3 of ref (12) for 0.25/0.75 antisymmetric composition relevant
to the SIZ-3/SIZ-4 blends) is found at a glance to be different from
our experimental one. One of the major differences is that there is
no double-gyroid phase existing in their theoretical phase diagram.12 Therefore, we decided to make a comparison with
the theoretical result for the neat AB diblocks in Figure 2. Definitely good agreement
between the experimental and theoretical morphology diagrams can be
recognized, although it has been reported that the cylinder region
expands while the lamellar region shrinks in the morphology diagram
upon blending two diblocks.33 One important
disagreement found in Figure 2 is that the experimental morphology diagram exhibits the
wider region of the disordered state, such that the direct transitions
to the disordered state were observed from the cylinders or from the
gyroid phase upon heating without passing through the spherical (body-centered
cubic) phase. However, this is a well-known phenomenon as the fluctuation effect reported by Khandpur et al. for the neat
block copolymers.53 Therefore, the disagreement
in the morphology diagram in Figure 2 is not ascribed to the blending. Thus, the mimicking
of the morphological phase diagram can be stated to be almost perfect
for this particular pair of the SI diblocks.

Figure 3 shows the
SAXS profiles measured at room temperature for MS5 and MS17 specimens.
The specimens were thermally annealed at 150 °C for 24 h in advance.
Here, q denotes the magnitude of the scattering vector,
defined as 3  with λ and θ
being the X-ray wavelength
and the scattering angle, respectively. For both profiles, reflection
peaks with q positions can be assigned relatively
to 1:√4:√7 (= √(h2 + hk + k2)), and these
can be considered to be reflections of {h k i 0}
planes of the hexagonal lattice. Since ϕPS = 0.31
and 0.70 for MS5 and MS17, respectively, observation of the hexagonal
lattice of cylindrical microdomains is reasonable. Furthermore, the
√3 reflection peak is completely extinguished. It was reported
that the √3 peak completely disappears when the volume fraction
equals to 0.326 (and 0.674 complementarily).54 These compositions are also in good accord with the MS5 and MS17
specimen characteristics. It is also found that the q positions of the first-order peaks are identical to each other for
these specimens. This result is again reasonable because of the similar
molecular weights of these specimens.

for MS5 and MS17 specimens.
The specimens were thermally annealed at 150 °C for 24 h in advance.

As shown in Figure 1, formation of the lamellar morphology is
expected for the antisymmetric
binary blend of MS5 and MS17. This is confirmed by the SAXS profiles
shown in Figure 4a,
where reflection peaks of q positions are assigned
relatively to 1:3. Here, the disappearance of the second-order peak
should be noted. It is because the average composition is 0.50 which
meets the condition of the extinguishment of the second-order peak
for the case of lamellar microdomains.55 Note that the peak breadth did not change as a function of temperature
for the neat MS11 and MS5/MS17 (50/50) blend specimens. Furthermore,
it should be noted that the reflection peaks are wider for the binary
blend as compared to the neat block (see the SAXS profiles shown in Figure 4b). This reminds
that the grains of lamellae are smaller in the blend than in the neat
block. To analyze the grain size quantitatively, it is evaluated according
to the method of Hosemann56,57 from the breadth of
the reflection peaks by using eq 4. 4  where Δq is the integral
width of the reflection peaks (Δq = S/Im, where S and Im denote, respectively, the peak
area (integrated intensity) and the scattering intensity at the peak
top). DG is the average grain size; d is the average spacing of the reflection planes; m is the order of the reflection peak; and g is the lattice distortion factor, as defined by 5  where Δd is the standard
deviation of the distribution of the spacing d. It
should be noted here that the experimentally observed peak breadth
contains an error due to the instrumental broadening. To correct for
this effect, the following relationship should be used 6  where Δq′ denotes
the observed peak breadth (integral width). Note here that B2 = 1.16 × 10–4 (nm–2) was estimated from the standard sample (chicken
tendon collagen) according to the procedure provided in our previous
paper.57 By conducting a computational
peak decomposition of the 1d-SAXS profiles, the peak breadth, Δq′, was evaluated for the first- and third-order
reflections, respectively, as m = 1 and 3. After
the correction according to eq 6, the (Δq)2 values were
obtained. Figure 5 shows
the plots of (Δq)2 vs m4 for the neat MS5, MS11, and MS17 specimens and the MS5/MS17
(50/50) blend specimen. From the slope and the intercept of the approximated
lines, values of the g factor and DG were estimated, respectively, which are summarized in Table 2. At a glance of the
SAXS profiles shown in Figure 4, the fact that the grain size in the blend was smaller as
compared to that of the neat lamellar specimen (MS11) might be ascribed
to blending. However, this is not appropriate because the grain sizes
of the neat MS5 and MS17 specimens (before blending) are found to
be as small as that of the blend. By examining the results shown in Table 2, it can be concluded
that both the grain size and the g factor were almost
unchanged upon blending.

temperature for the

specimen and (b) MS11 (the neat block copolymer). These are the results
of the in situ SAXS measurements in the course of the temperature
ramp of 2.0 °C/min.

We now examine the temperature dependence of the lamellar spacing.
To clearly examine the unusual behavior, the exponent α in the
relationship of D ∼ Tα is evaluated with assuming the scaling behavior between D and T in the short experimental range
of 150–180 °C. Actually, this assumption can be confirmed
in Figure 6 (the double logarithmic plots of the lamellar spacing D and the absolute temperature T) for all
of the antisymmetric blends (with similar molecular weights), although
our previous result showed nonlinear dependence for much wider temperature
range (120–220 °C).19 Note
here that D is evaluated by D =
2π/q* from the q position
(q*) of the first-order peak in the SAXS profile.
In order to accurately determine q*, the computational
peak fitting was performed on the first-order peak. As seen in the
plot of Figure 6c (for
the neat MS11 diblock copolymer), the usual behavior is observed with
a slightly higher value of α than the usual one (α = −0.33).
On the other hand, unusual behaviors are seen for all of the blend
specimens. Especially, completely opposite temperature dependence
is observed for the MS1/MS19 blend specimen. Note that this specimen
has the most biased compositions of the blended diblock copolymers.
It is also noted here that the temperature-independent D is also recognized for the MS3/MS18 blend specimen (as shown in Figure 6d) as well as for
the MS5/MS17 blend specimen (as shown in Figure 6b) for which SAXS profiles were shown in Figure 4a as a function of
temperature.

specimens. Note here that the two diblock copolymers in each blend
specimen have similar molecular weights.

It is important to examine the effect of thermal expansion
on α.
For the rubbery state (T > Tg), the literature values of the thermal expansivity β
[= (d lnV/dT)p] for PS
are located in the range of 5.1–6.0 × 10–4 K–158 and β for
PMA is 5.6 × 10–4 K–1.59 Assuming the isotropic thermal expansion, the
scaling exponent α can be expressed by 7  For the temperature range of the examination
of the scaling behavior in Figure 6 (150–180 °C), the scaling exponent due
to the thermal expansion can be estimated using eq 7 as 0.072–0.091, which is quite a bit
smaller than α = 0.42 at most experimental values found by this
study.

Such unusual temperature dependence of D (D increases with temperature) has been reported
already
in our previous publication19 for the case
when the two blended diblock copolymers have biased compositions.
The dependence of α on the degree of deviation in composition,
Δϕ, is shown in Figure 7a. Here, Δϕ is defined as 8  where x1 and x2 are the volume fraction of the diblock copolymers
1 and 2, respectively, in the binary blend (x1 + x2 = 1). ϕPS,1 and ϕPS,2 denote the volume fraction of PS in the
diblock copolymers 1 and 2, respectively. It is clear that α
increases with Δϕ and that its dependency is accelerated
as a function of Δϕ. Although it was possible to fit the
data with a mathematic equation, it is more convenient to obtain a
linear dependence. For this purpose, we introduce the degree of asymmetry
(τ) of the compositions for the blended diblock copolymers,
as defined by 9  where ϕPS,1 < 0.5 and
ϕPS,2 > 0.5. For the neat diblock copolymer with
the composition of 0.50, τ is so defined to be zero. As for
the blend of homopolymers 1 and 2, τ becomes infinity. For the
MS1/MS19 specimen exhibiting the unusual behavior as shown in Figure 6a, τ is quite
large (τ = 3.13). Thus, it is considered that the unusual behavior
is more intensively observed (namely, the exponent α becomes
positive and larger) for the larger value of τ. We now examine
the relationship between α and τ quantitatively in Figure 7b for the blends
with the average PS fraction of 0.50 (not only for the antisymmetric
cases but also for the nonantisymmetric cases). In Figure 7b, good linearity can be confirmed.
This clearly indicates that τ is a good measure of the unusual
behavior of D. As shown in Figure 2, the blends of two diblock copolymers can
form the lamellar morphology in the average composition range of 0.4–0.6
at χZ ≈ 20. Therefore, it was also possible
to check the relationship between α and τ as shown in Figure 7c for the cases of
the average PS fraction of 0.40 and 0.60 (not exactly identical to
0.50). On the contrary to Figure 7b, the linearity is poor in Figure 7c. Here, the broken line is shown as a guide
for the eye, of which the slope is the same as the approximated line
in Figure 7b but the
broken line is shifted to set the origin of this broken line at (α,
τ) ≈ (−0.25, 0.5). Interestingly, the good linearity
is only found for the average PS fraction of 0.50 (Figure 7b), while the linearity is
poor for the case of the average PS fraction being not exactly identical
to 0.50 (Figure 7c).
This fact clearly indicates that the temperature behavior of the lamellar
microdomain spacing can be controlled almost perfectly by means of
τ for the case of the lamellar structure comprising the antisymmetric
AB/AB diblock copolymer chains, as shown ideally in Figure 1.

Figure 7 (a) Dependence of the
exponent α on the degree of deviation
in composition, Δϕ, for the average PS fraction of 0.50
(antisymmetric MS/MS blends). Note here that the exponent α
denotes the scaling relation between D and T as D ∼ Tα. The definition of Δϕ is given by eq 8 in the text. (b) Dependence
of α on the degree of asymmetry (τ) of the composition
for the blends with the average PS fraction of 0.50 (not only for
the antisymmetric cases but also for the nonantisymmetric cases).
The definition of τ is given by eq 9 in the text. (c) The same plot as (b) but for the
average PS fraction of 0.40 and 0.60.

Moreover, a slight breaking of the balance of the antisymmetric
compositions in the two kinds of the AB diblocks (namely, those compositions
do not meet ϕPS,1 = 1 – ϕPS,2) can be allowed for the precise controlling of α by means
of τ as long as the average composition is maintained at 0.50.
On the contrary, the precise controlling of α by means of τ
is difficult when the average composition is not identical to 0.50
(namely, the lamellar structure is not like that shown in Figure 1). Thus, the illustration
in Figure 1 is considered
to give a good physical insight into recognizing the anomalous temperature
behavior (namely, the lamellar spacing increases with temperature).

Figure 8 explains
the reason for the unusual behavior of D for the
case of the antisymmetric binary blend of diblock copolymers forming
the lamellar morphology, as compared with the case of the neat diblock
copolymers. Here, the UCST-type behavior is assumed. As shown in Figure 8a, the repulsive
interaction between A and B block chains deforms the polymer coils
in the direction perpendicular to the lamellar interface. Therefore,
the degree of the deformation of the polymer coil is decreased when
the repulsive interaction is decreased at higher temperature. This
explains qualitatively the decrease in D with the
increase in T for the neat diblock copolymers (enhancement
of miscibility results in D2 < D1). As for the case of the antisymmetric binary
blend of diblock copolymers forming the lamellar morphology (Figure 8b and 8c), the strong segregation between the longer A and the longer
B chains is screened by the shorter A and the shorter B chains. Due
to the screen effect, the longer chains of A and B cannot feel their
existence, and therefore the longer chains are not necessarily stretched
in the direction perpendicular to the lamellar interface (the longitudinal
direction). On the contrary at higher temperature, the miscibility
between the shorter A and the shorter B chains is increased because
the value of χZ (segregation power) is lower
for the lower molecular-weight components. Therefore, the shorter
A and B chains can be more or less partially mixed, resulting in interdigitation
of the interface, as shown in Figure 8b and 8c. The mixed shorter
A/B chain interphase can be formed, if the molecular weights of the
shorter chains are small enough to meet the condition of the miscibility
(i.e., the χZ value is lower than the critical
value of the complete miscible state). In such condition, the lateral
distance between the two neighboring longer chains is decreased so
that the chance of chain overlapping is increased. To avoid the chain
overlaps, the longer chains tend to be stretched. Due to this effect
the longer chains are more or less stretched in the longitudinal direction
even at higher temperature (as schematically illustrated in Figure 8c), resulting in D2 > D1, although
the stretching of the longer chains can be reduced at higher temperature
because of the lower χ value. The domain spacing does not change
with temperature as shown schematically in Figure 8b, resulting in D2 ≈ D1, when the two effects (avoiding
the chain overlaps and the decreasing χ value by increasing
temperature) are balanced.

Figure 8 (a) Schematic illustration for explaining the
reason for the decrease
in the domain spacing (D) upon heating for the case
of the neat diblock copolymers forming the lamellar morphology. (b)
Schematic illustration for explaining the reason for the unusual behavior
of D (temperature-independent D)
for the case of the antisymmetric binary blends of diblock copolymers
(with smaller τ). (c) Schematic illustration for explaining
the reason for the unusual behavior of D (increasing D) for the case of the antisymmetric binary blends of diblock
copolymers (with larger τ). Here, the UCST-type behavior is
assumed. The concept of this figure is the same as Figure 5 of ref (19) (copyright ACS).

Based on the result shown in Figure 7b, one can prepare
lamellar microdomains for which
spacing does not change with temperature by blending two diblock copolymers
with τ = 1.33 (corresponding to ϕPS,1 = 0.3
and ϕPS,2 = 0.7) having the same molecular weights.
The relevant situation to the temperature-independent D for the smaller degree of asymmetry is schematically illustrated
in Figure 8b, which
is in between the situations illustrated in Figures 8a and 8c. Shi and
Noolandi11 have reported the theoretical
result on this subject, and it may be recognized from their result
(Figure 10 of ref (11)) that the domain spacing is unchanged upon the change of the interaction
parameter (χ) in the range of 0.05–0.20 for the compositions
of 0.18 and 0.82 for the diblock copolymers 1 and 2, respectively.
As compared to our experimental result, these compositions are more
biased. As for the more biased compositions our experimental result
of the anomality in the temperature dependence of the domain spacing
(D increases with T) is theoretically
supported.

It is important to recognize that the spacing D can be scaled by the total lengths of the longer block
chains A
and B, according to the molecular model as illustrated in Figure 1. To examine this
insight, the values of the spacing D at 150 °C
were plotted in Figure 9a against the summation of Mn of the
PMA block in the MS diblock 1 having ϕPS,1 (<0.5)
and Mn of the PS block in the MS diblock
2 having ϕPS,2 (>0.5). Note here that the labels
a–e indicate the data points for the blend specimens shown
in Figures 6a–6e, respectively. It is very clear that the linearity
of the data points in Figure 9a is much better as compared to the plot shown in Figure 9b as a function of
the average Mn of the two diblocks blended,
although the values of the spacing for the points at a and b and those
at c and d are not appropriately in a good order as a function of Mn (PMA,1) + Mn (PS,2).
However, the plots in Figure 9a still show satisfactorily the good linearity as it is.

°C as a function of the summation of Mn of the PMA block in the MS diblock 1 having ϕPS,1 (<0.5) and Mn of the PS block in

same
plot as a function of the average Mn of
the two diblocks blended. Here, the labels a–e indicate the
data points for the blend specimens shown in Figures 6a–6e, respectively.

Finally, the changes in D as a function of temperature
are examined in the cycled heating-and-cooling processes for the blend
specimens showing the temperature-independent D in
the first heating process. Figure 10 shows the results in the
double logarithmic plots of D and T for the MS5/MS17 (50/50) blend specimen. The temperature ramp-up
rate was 2.0 °C/min, and the cooling rate was also 2.0 °C/min.
The hysteresis of the changes in D is clearly observed,
and then it can be stated that the temperature-independent D in the first heating process was not permanent. It is
interestingly found that D is almost constant not
only in the first heating but also in the second heating, although
the level of D increased. Furthermore, the usual
behavior with the exponent α being equal to −0.33 (which
is also usual) was found in the second cooling process. The illustration
presented in Figure 8b is considered irreversible, and it may be speculated that the arrangement
of the shorter chains giving rise to the screening effect for the
longer chains cannot be retrieved completely in the cooling process.
Therefore, the longer chains feeling the repulsive interaction are
more stretched in the direction perpendicular to the lamellar interface
in the cooling process, resulting in the increase in D with a decrease in T. The miscibility enhancement
takes place only between the shorter A and the shorter B chains when
heated again because the shorter chains can easily rearrange positions
as compared to the longer chains. Thus, the invariance in D in the heating process appeared again in the second heating
process. However, the invariant behavior is no longer the case in
the third heating process. Therefore, it is considered that the rearrangement
of the shorter chains is no longer available after the second heating
process, and then the usual behavior appeared in the third heating
process, as well as in the second cooling process. Since the rearrangement
of the shorter chains promotes also the macroscopic phase separation,
the blend specimen is considered to be no longer forming the lamellar
morphology (or forming only irregular lamellae). Thus, it should be
concluded that such anomalous behavior (including the temperature-invariant D behavior) is only transient (not permanent), taking place
along the course of the macroscopic phase separation between the diblock
copolymers 1 and 2, as it may be theoretically predicted by Shi and
Noolandi.11 As for the application for
the utilization of the temperature-invariant properties (for instance,
the optical properties due to the form birefringence of microdomains60,61), cross-linking of constituent block chains may work for the robustness
of temperature-invariant properties in many repeated cycles of heating
and cooling.

cooling rate was also 2.0 °C/min.

Conclusions
The morphologies of the microphase-separated
structures in the
binary blends of diblock copolymers (SI/SI) have been studied intensively
for the case of diblock copolymers bearing antisymmetric compositions
with similar molecular weights. Here, the two diblock copolymers 1
and 2, of which compositions are 0.5 – x and
0.5 + x (0 < x < 0.5), respectively,
were blended, and the morphology diagram was constructed in the plot
of χZ vs ϕPS. The temperature
dependencies of the morphologies were analyzed by synchrotron SAXS
measurements. It was found that the morphology diagram agrees in principle
with the theoretical one by Matsen and Bates,1 although the disordered phase was a bit expanded in the experimentally
determined morphology diagram.

The antisymmetric binary blends
of MS diblock copolymers having
oppositely biased compositions were prepared to study anomalous temperature
dependence of the lamellar spacing. For this purpose, more than 20
specimens have been synthesized with a wide range of compositions
from 0.20 to 0.87 and the range of the molecular weight of 12000–33800.
Note that the molecular weights of the blended diblock copolymers
were chosen almost the same as each other and that the compositions
of the blended diblock copolymers 1 and 2 are ϕPS,1 = 0.5 – x and ϕPS,2 = 0.5
+ x (0 < x < 0.5), respectively.
By closely adjusting the average PS volume fraction in the blend specimen
at 0.50, it was possible to form the lamellar morphology without macroscopic
phase separation, as speculated something like the illustration shown
in Figure 1. As a result
of the SAXS analyses, the following things were found. The scaling
exponent α in D ∼ Tα was still negative but slightly larger than the
usual value (i.e., α = −0.33) for the smaller degree
of asymmetry in the composition (i.e., x is small),
while α became positive for the higher degree of asymmetry.
The latter result is very anomalous because the temperature dependence
is opposite (i.e., the lamellar spacing increases with an increase
of temperature). The value of α was found to be linearly rationalized
with the degree of compositional asymmetry τ (which is especially
introduced in the current paper for this purpose), including nonantisymmetric
binary blend cases (however, with the average PS composition being
set rigorously at 0.50). Based on this result, one can prepare lamellar
microdomains of which spacing does not change with temperature by
blending two diblock copolymers with τ = 1.33 (corresponding
to ϕPS,1 = 0.3 and ϕPS,2 = 0.7)
having similar molecular weights. This would be important for manufacturing
materials with properties (for instance, the optical property) independent
of temperature. Nevertheless, it was found that such anomalous behavior
(including the temperature-invariant D behavior)
is only transient (not permanent), taking place along the course of
the macroscopic phase separation between the diblock copolymers 1
and 2. Cross-linking of constituent block chains may work for the
robustness of temperature-invariant properties in many repeated cycles
of heating and cooling. From the current study, the binary blends
of the antisymmetric diblock copolymers were concluded to be versatile
such that the precise controls of the morphologies and the temperature
dependencies of the lamellar microdomains were possible.

Experimental
Section
Specimens
Two SI diblock copolymers, SIZ-3 and SIZ-4,
were synthesized by living anionic polymerization. The molecular characteristics
are ϕPS = 0.65 and Mn = 26.1 × 103 for SIZ-3 and ϕPS =
0.26 and Mn = 24.5 × 103 for SIZ-4. These are the same specimens used in our previous studies.19,21,22

The MS diblock copolymers
were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) under
reduced pressure, according to the previous method.52,62,63 Inhibitors of radical polymerization (or
antioxidants) in styrene (Extra Pure Reagent, Nacalai Tesque Co.,
Ltd.), methyl acrylate (Extra Pure Reagent, Nacalai Tesque), anisole
(Extra Pure Reagent, Nacalai Tesque), and toluene (Extra Pure Reagent,
Nacalai Tesque) were removed by adsorption on granular activated alumina. N,N,N′,N′,N″-Pentamethyldiethylenetriamine
(PMDETA, 99%, Aldrich Chemical Co., Ltd.), methyl 2-bromopropionate
(MBrP, 98%, Aldrich), and CuBr (98%, Aldrich) were used as received.
As a first component, PMA was synthesized. The initiator (MBrP), CuBr(I),
and the ligand (PMDETA) with their molar ratio 2:1:1 were added to
a given amount of the methyl acrylate monomer. Finally, the solvent
anisole was poured into the system with the concentration of 25 wt
% with respect to the monomer amount. The solution was added in a
round-bottomed flask. After degassing by freeze-and-thaw cycles three
times, the flask was sealed in vacuum. The sealed flask was immersed
into an oil-bath at 368 K to conduct polymerization. After the polymerization,
the solution was diluted with toluene. Activated alumina powders were
used to remove the catalysts. Subsequently, synthesized PMA was precipitated
into a large amount of methanol from the toluene solution. The PMA
was dried under vacuum at 323 K for 24 h and subjected to the gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements to determine Mn and its distribution (Mw/Mn). The radical can be reproduced
at the PMA chain ends and was used as a macroinitiator in the successive
stage of the chain extension reaction of PS chains. This polymer was
chain-extended with PS via the ATRP at 383 K using the CuBr(I) (or
CuCl(I)) and PMDETA. The PMA macroinitiator, CuBr(I) (or CuCl(I)),
and the ligand with 1:1:1 molar ratio were added to a given amount
of the styrene monomer. Finally, the solvent anisole was poured into
the system with the concentration of 25 wt % with respect to the monomer
amount and then polymerized at 383 K. The catalysts were removed by
the same procedure mentioned above. After the chain extension reaction,
the reaction mixture was purified by the precipitation from toluene
solution into excess methanol. Then, the total Mn and Mw/Mn were determined by the GPC measurement. To evaluate the composition,
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements were performed on AVANCE
(Bruker) operated at 200 MHz at room temperature. The deuterated chloroform
(CDCl3) was used as a solvent. Using the densities of 1.11
and 1.04 [g/cm3] for PMA and PS, respectively, ϕPS was eventually evaluated. The characteristics of MS samples
thus synthesized are summarized in Table 1.

Preparation of the Blend Specimens
It is very important
to prepare the blend specimens without undergoing the macroscopic
phase separation. As a matter of fact, there would be a large chance
of the macroscopic phase separation if the general solution casting
would be conducted for the binary blend of diblock copolymers 1 and
2 for which compositions are very much different. Therefore, the special
solution casting protocol was employed in the current study according
to the method, which was already reported in our previous publication.19 In principle, this method utilizes blow drying
of the casting solution developed on the water surface to quickly
evaporate the cast solvent. First, the MS diblock copolymers were
independently weighed to make a blend with a given ratio, and then
they were altogether dissolved in toluene. The casting solution was
prepared with 8 wt % of the total polymer concentration by stirring
for more than 12 h. A small amount of an antioxidant (tert-butyl catechol) was added to set the final concentration at 0.2
wt % of the antioxidant in the polymer specimen. Then, the casting
solution was developed on the surface of distilled water by using
a syringe. Then, it was dried drop by drop by using a hair dryer,
and the dried specimen was gathered. This treatment was repeated many
times to obtain a large enough amount of the specimen. Finally, the
specimens were thermally annealed at 150 °C for 24 h in an oven
purged with the dried nitrogen gas in order to fabricate a regular
lamellar morphology without the macroscopic phase separation, as schematically
shown in Figure 1.

Note here that the molecular weights of the blended diblock copolymers
were chosen almost the same as each other. Actually the molecular
weights of the blended specimens, which are used for the examination
of the temperature dependence of D as shown in Figure 6, are similar to
each other, as MS1/MS19 (16500/14500; the ratio is 1.14), MS5/MS17(20900/20600;
the ratio is 1.01), MS3/MS18 (12900/14000; the ratio is 1.09), and
MS8/MS13 (15200/14200; the ratio is 1.07).

Synchrotron SAXS Measurements
The SAXS measurements
were carried out at the BL-10C beamline of the Photon Factory, High
Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan,21,22 using X-ray with a wavelength of 0.1488 nm. This beamline provides
a quasi point-focused beam by using a toroidal mirror, and the beam
size was measured at the detector position, which was 850 μm
in the vertical direction and 1000 μm in the horizontal direction.
A standard slit system with widths of 0.7 × 0.7 mm was used for
the SAXS collimation. The sample-to-detector distance was set at 1.9
m. A position-sensitive-proportional counter was used as a one-dimensional
detector to measure the scattering-angle-dependent X-ray intensity
(one-dimensional SAXS profile) at once. The scattering intensity of
an empty cell was subtracted from that of a specimen by taking into
account of absorption due to the specimen. For the measurements of
the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles, the time-resolved measurements
were performed with the heating of the specimen at 2 °C/min in
a narrow temperature range of 150–180 °C.
