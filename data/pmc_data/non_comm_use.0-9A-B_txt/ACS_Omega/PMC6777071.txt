The
chemically oxidized gum arabic was prepared and used as a naturally
derived nontoxic and pH-responsive cross-linker to develop smart polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogels for the first time. The formulated hydrogels
exhibited high mechanical properties, good porosity, and pH sensitivity,
which facilitated their application as promising biomaterials for
sustained delivery of folic acid. Further, the synthesized cross-linked
PVA hydrogels displayed no cytotoxicity toward the human embryonic
kidney cell line and exhibited higher blood compatibility. The hydrolytic
degradation study confirmed their biodegradable nature. While the
sustained delivery along with photoprotective properties of these
hydrogels confirmed their multifunctional characteristics, these results
suggest that these hydrogels may act as an efficient photoprotective
material and find their application in the field of drug delivery.

1 Introduction
In recent years, periodate modification of biopolymers like hyaluronic
acid,1 cellulose,2 gum arabic (GA),3 alginate4 and so forth have received an enormous interest
in synthesizing the most active, green, nontoxic, and biocompatible
cross-linking agent, which have been used in the formation of hydrogels.
These periodate-modified polysaccharides having certain advantages
over conventional aldehyde-based cross-linkers as these are higher
molecular weight macromolecules having larger size which prevents
them from evaporation, thereby reducing environmental toxicity.5 Among these, GA being highly water soluble, readily
available, sustainable, and easily processable is found to be the
suitable material for the formulation of hydrogel.6,7 The
periodate oxidation of GA proceeds with the C2–C3 bond cleavage of its glucose residues resulting in the formation
of di aldehyde groups per monomeric unit. These aldehyde groups of
oxidized GA (OGA) can cross-link with NH2/OH groups of
other polymers resulting in the formation of hydrogels via Schiff
base/acetal linkages.8 For instance, Nishi
and Jayakrishnan9 used OGA as cross-linking
agent in the synthesis of injectable polymer conjugate-based hydrogel
used for drug delivery. The fabricated hydrogel exhibited sustained
release behavior. Recently, Sarika et al.3 have used OGA as the main precursor as well as an internal cross-linker
in the preparation of hydrogel scaffolds. The developed hydrogel showed
no cytotoxicity toward the cells and act as a suitable material for
drug screening and cancer therapy. However, literature reveals that
the cross-linking efficiency of OGA with OH group containing polymers
has not been explored till date, which needs to be further investigated.

The hydrogels based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) have been extensively
used in various biotechnological applications like drug delivery,
tissue engineering, articular cartilage, and wound dressings10,11 because of their nontoxic, recyclable, water-soluble, eco-friendly,
and biodegradable nature. In addition, PVA possesses excellent film-forming
ability, favorable thermal property, and flexibility.12 However, poor stiffness and hydrophilicity limit its applications.
These drawbacks can be overcome through the combination of PVA with
other biopolymers using various methods like cross-linking and blending.11,13 The physical cross-linking methods like thawing, freezing, and high-temperature
treatment have been used, which facilitates the formation of weak
interactions within the hydrogel and also their cross-linking mechanism
is not clearly understood.14,15 The chemical cross-linking
approach is found to be the most promising one because of the involvement
of chemical interactions between the PVA and the cross-linker resulting
in the formation of more stable hydrogels. These interactions can
significantly enhance the absorption and mechanical properties of
PVA in aqueous solutions and physiological fluids thus, enhance their
biological activities. The various conventional chemical cross-linking
agents like anhydrides, epichlorohydrin, and aldehydes (formaldehyde,
glutaraldehyde, and benzaldehyde), used for the cross-linking of PVA
has a synthetic origin which is associated with high level of toxicity
causing harmful effects on environment and living cells. Besides,
these low-molecular weight molecules have small size, which may penetrate
easily through many portals into living systems.15 Therefore, for environmental safety and biomedical application,
there is higher requirement for biocompatible green and nontoxic cross-linkers
derived from natural polymers which have the tendency to function
as a substitute to these lower molecular weight and toxic cross-linking
agents.16

In this regard, present
study highlights the utilization of a naturally
derived cross-linker, that is OGA, for the design and formulation
of cross-linked PVA-based hydrogels using folic acid (FA) as sample
drug and investigate its photoprotection ability and sustained delivery.
Structural, mechanical, and physico-chemical properties of PVA cross-linked
hydrogels such as chemical structure, morphological observations,
swelling behavior, and tensile properties were characterized. The
hemolytic assay and in vitro biocompatibility of these cross-linked
hydrogels were also investigated to confirm their nontoxic nature.

2 Results and Discussion
The GA was successfully oxidized
to form a promising cross-linking
agent (OGA). The OGA was used to synthesize highly cross-linked PVA-based
hydrogels.

2.1 Preparation and Structural Analysis of OGA
Oxidation of GA was carried out using 4.67 mmol concentrations
of NaIO4 to form OGA (Figure 1a) with 46.16% degree of oxidation and 4.37
mmol/g aldehyde content. The formation of OGA was successfully confirmed
from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and NMR analysis (Figure 1b,d). FTIR spectra
of GA showed a stretching peak OH group at 3255 cm–1, −asymmetric CO stretching frequency at 1600 cm–1 and −CH2 stretching band at 2927 cm–1. The occurrence of the peak at 1417 cm–1 can be
ascribed to −CH and −CH2 wagging vibrations
arising because of skeletal motions of the carbon rings.29 While as the OGA showed new peaks at 1729 and
876 cm–1 which correspond to the CO stretching of
aldehyde and formation of hemiacetal bands, respectively.30

Figure 1 Oxidation of GA to form OGA (a), FTIR spectra of GA and
OGA (b), 1NMR spectra of GA (c), and OGA (d).

The GA protons showed almost similar chemical shifts in the 1H NMR spectrum as that reported by Ali et al. and on comparison
an acceptable matching of signal was achieved17 (Figure 1c). The 1H NMR spectrum of OGA (Figure 1d) also confirms its successful formation. The presence
of a small peak at 9.48 ppm was detected, which can be to aldehydic
protons of OGA.30

The solid 13C NMR spectra of GA comprise the peaks at
13.7 ppm (C-6, Rhap), 60.1 ppm (C-2, C-5, Galp-Rhaf), 100–120
ppm (C-1), and 165.1 ppm (C-6, Glap A); these peaks are in well agreement
with that reported in the literature.31 A clear and pure 13C NMR spectrum of OGA in the solution
form was difficult to be obtained because of its poor D2O solubility, which therefore showed the poorly resolved signal of
carbonyl in the range of 175–180 ppm (not given here). From
solid-state 13C shifts of OGA, a peak at 174 ppm was observed
(Figure 2) which may
be ascribed to the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde group.

2.2 Formulation and Structural Analysis of Cross-linked
PVA Hydrogels
The cross-linked PVA hydrogels were formulated
via acetal linkage between the OH groups of PVA and aldehyde of OGA
(Figure 3a). The FTIR spectra of the pure PVA film (F0) consist of a peak at 3390 cm–1, which is due in stretching vibration of OH groups of PVA, the bands
between 2910 and 2921 cm–1 can be due to asymmetric
stretching vibration of the C–H bond (Figure 3b). While the peak at 1630 and 1087 cm–1 corresponds to C=O and C–O stretching
of acetyl groups, respectively.32 The FT-IR
spectra of F0 and cross-linked hydrogels (F1, F2, and F3) showed differences
in characteristic peaks with increase in concentration of OGA (Figure 3b). The large broad
band was observed in the frequency range of 3250–3390 cm–1 because of intermolecular and intramolecular stretching
vibrations of OH groups. It has been observed that the intensity of
OH groups decreased with the increased cross-linking density indicating
more involvement of −OH groups in acetal bond formation. The
peaks observed at 2840–2859 and 1705–1724 cm–1 can be attributed to O–C–H and C=O stretching
of unreacted aldehyde and their intensities relatively decrease with
the increased concentration of OGA. The band is observed at 1005–1040
cm–1 with gradual increase in the peak intensity
upon increasing the concentration of OGA. This can be ascribed to
the presence of O–C–O acetal group vibrations.33

OGA with
PVA, (b) FTIR spectra of (F0), and cross-linked PVA hydrogels (F1,
F2, and F3).

2.3 X-ray
Analysis
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) spectra of F0 and cross-linked hydrogels F1, F2, and F3 hydrogels
are shown in (Figure 4). It is observed that the F0 film showed two distinct diffraction
peaks at 19.6° and 40.3° which are due to (101) and (111)
planes of the monoclinic unit cell, respectively.34 The semicrystalline nature of F0 is because of the intermolecular
H-bonding. However, upon cross-linking the intensity of the peak decreases
at 19.6°, while the peak at 40.3° disappeared. This can
be attributed to the acetal bond formation which substitutes the hydrogen
bonding. Therefore, increase in cross-linker density increases amorphousness,
thus, F3 hydrogel exhibited more amorphous nature than other hydrogels.

of cross-linked PVA hydrogels.

2.4 Morphology of PVA Cross-linked Hydrogels
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize the surface
morphologies of cross-linked hydrogels. The hydrogel (F1) exhibits
a highly porous surface morphology as shown in Figure 5 (F1 and F1′ at two different resolutions).
However, when the OGA content increases, the porosity and the pore
size decrease, and the average pore size F1 hydrogel was in the range
of 181.6 μm and that of F2 and F3 was 94.92 and 91.99 μm,
respectively. Thus, F3 hydrogel which has higher OGA concentration
resulted in the formation of highly compact gel with low porosity.
Therefore, the increased cross-linking lowers the available free volume
in the hydrogels that may reduce the swelling properties of the resultant
hydrogel.

Figure 5 SEM micrographs of PVA cross-linked hydrogels F1, F2, and F3.

2.5 Mechanical Strength
The mechanical
Strength (elongation break and tensile strength) of F0 and cross-linked
hydrogels (F1, F2, and F3) were investigated at 25 °C. From the
strain–stress curve (Figure 6), it can be concluded that F0 displays a tensile strength
of 21.03 MPa with percent elongation of 314%. However, when the concentration
of OGA was increased, the % elongation of the hydrogels decreased
while the value of tensile strength increased, and the maximum value
was 43.99 MPa in case of the F3 hydrogel film having highest concentration
of OGA. Cross-linking helps in the formation of inter- and intramolecular
linkages and thus helps in lengthening of PVA molecules. However,
the interaction among the molecules could be enhanced, which results
in enhancement in tensile strength and decline in % elongation in
case of F1 with low cross-linking higher sliding of PVA molecules
may take place. The continuous increase in the cross-linking concentration
avoids the sliding of PVA molecules because of higher inter- and intra-molecular
interactions, which cause decrease of % elongation. Thus, F1 hydrogel
which has lower concentration of OGA (30 mg/mL) shows higher values
of tensile strain and lower value of tensile stress than other cross-linked
hydrogels.

Figure 6 Stress–strain graph of cross-linked hydrogels.

2.6 Differential Scanning Calorimetry of Cross-linked
Hydrogels
The Tg and Tm of F0 and F1, F2, and F3 cross-linked hydrogels
were analyzed with the help of the second heating thermograms (Figure 7). The F0 showed Tg at around 67 °C and Tm at 215 °C which is in well agreement with that
reported in the literature.35 It has been
observed from the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) graph that
by increasing OGA concentration, Tg of
hydrogels increases from 72.5 °C for F1 and 78.37 and 86.13 °C
F2 and F3, respectively. The increase in the values of Tg of these cross-linked PVA hydrogels are very comparable
to that already reported in literature.36 The increasing of Tg with increasing
cross-linking concentration can be ascribed to the chemical interactions
between OH groups of PVA and aldehyde groups of OGA which limits polymer
chain mobility. However, it was also observed that by increasing OGA
concentration, the melting endotherm peaks shifted slightly to lower
temperature. The decrease in Tm may be
related to the declining of crystallization because of cross-linking
reaction between the PVA and OGA which suppresses the hydrogen bonding
interaction in the PVA polymer chains and leads to the amorphous nature
in the hydrogels. These results are in accordance with that obtained
from XRD analysis which shows amorphous nature of highly cross-linked
hydrogel.

2.7 Swelling
Studies
The swelling behavior
of cross-linked hydrogels (F1, F2, and F3) was studied at pH 7.4 and
2.1. It has been observed from the swelling plots (Figure 8) that the equilibrium degree
of swelling for all cross-linked hydrogels films was achieved in 9
h. The hydrogels with lower OGA cross-linked showed a higher degree
of swelling than the hydrogel with higher cross-linker concentrations.
The higher concentration of OGA favors the formation of highly cross-linked
networks in the hydrogel films, which restrict the mobility of the
polymeric chains and thus limits their exposure to the water molecules.
Besides, the OH groups of PVA are hydrophilic and can easily undergo
hydration with water. As the cross-linking density increases, more
hydroxyl groups are participated in acetal bond formation; hence the
capacity of OH groups to form hydrogen bonds with water decreases,
which led to the reduction in the swelling capacity of hydrogels.
Further, the higher percentage of swelling occurred at pH 7.4 than
at pH 2.1 for all hydrogel because at higher pH, more OH– ions are generated that hydrolyze the acetate groups of PVA. Therefore,
the chains become more ionic possessing similar charges which create
repulsive forces that repel the chains, thereby increasing the space
for incoming solution and improves the swelling ratio.37

Figure 8 Percentage swelling plot of cross-linked hydrogels at
(a) pH 2.1
and (b) 7.4.

The date of swelling plots (Figure 8) has been used for
the evaluation of the cross-linked
network of these hydrogels. Various parameters like MC, ξ, and
ρ are used for characterizing the porous structure of hydrogels
which are necessary for the transport of various drugs. These parameters
can easily be determined from swelling equilibrium theory given by
Wright and Peppas.18 On the application
of this theory, it has been observed that the MC and ξ values
are found to be higher in cross-linked PVA hydrogels with low cross-inking
concentration as shown in Table 1.

2.8 Biocompatibility Studies
The biocompatibility
studies carried out using MTT assay on HEK-293, revealed that cross-linked
hydrogel film and FA-loaded hydrogel (F1) do not show any significant
decline in the cell viability and did not induce any cytotoxicity
in the dose range of 8–64 μg/mL up to 48 h (Figure 9d). However, these
hydrogels showed a marginal cytotoxicity (less than 20%) at a higher
dosage (128 μg/mL), which is not considered as higher toxicity.
Further, the results revealed that the original cell morphology was
not affected by the treatment with FA loaded and unloaded hydrogel
(Figure 9a–c)
even at the maximum concentration (i.e. 128 μg/mL).

2.9 Hemolytic Assay
The application of
hydrogels in various biomedical fields like drug delivery involves
the usage of living beings, thus it is important to determine their
blood compatibility. The blood compatibility in in vitro conditions
of FA-loaded hydrogel (F1) was carried out with three different concentrations
(50, 150, and 250 mg/mL) via hemolysis tests. It was observed that
the hemolysis percentage of 1.64% was found at 250 mg/mL concentration
followed by 1.57 and 1.11% at 150 and 50 mg/mL concentrations, respectively
(Figure 9e). Therefore,
with the increase in concentration, the hemolysis percentage increased
and was found to be lower than 2%, confirming the nontoxic nature
of hydrogels.38

2.10 Hydrolytic
Degradation
The hydrolytic
degradation of cross-linked hydrogels (F1, F2, and F3) was investigated
in the buffer solution (pH 7.4), which causes the hydrolysis of acetal
linkages and enhances the biodegradability. The degradability investigations
revealed that initially an increase in the weight of hydrogels was
observed through swelling. After achieving equilibrium swelling, successive
weight loss was detected. The F1 hydrogel showed more weight loss
as compared to F2 and F3 because of the presence of lower cross-linker
concentration, which causes improvement in the water uptake ability,
thus favors its hydrolytic degradation. All the hydrogels showed higher
hydrolytic stability and start to degrade after 2 days. The enhancement
in the rate of degradation of F3 hydrogel can be attributed to the
formation highly stable acetal linkage between the OGA and OH groups
of PVA. The F1 hydrogel shows about 98% weight loss after 18 days
which is 40% greater than F3 (Figure 10).

Figure 10 Hydrolytic degradation of F1, F2, and F3 hydrogels.

2.11 Loading and in Vitro Release
of FA
The loading of FA in cross-linked hydrogel showed a
higher % of loading
in case of F1 (29.11 and 21.03%) compared to F2 (24.11 and 17.27%)
and F3 (17.21 and 13.42%) after 72 h at both pH 7.4 and 2.1. The loading
of FA was observed to be relatively lower in F2 and F3 at both pH,
which can be due to formation of highly cross-linked networks in these
hydrogels, thereby lowering the available space in the hydrogel matrix.
The loaded FA hydrogel films (∼50 mg) were kept in 20 mL of
solution (pH 7.4 and 2.1) at room temperature. Samples were withdrawn
periodically, replaced with fresh medium to keep the constant volume
of the dissolution medium same. The amount of FA released from the
hydrogel samples were measured using the spectrophotometer. The release
behavior of FA was investigated at acidic and basic medium, which
exists in stomach and intestines, respectively. From the release behavior,
it was found that higher percentage of release occurred at pH 7.4
than at pH 2.1 Assadpour et al.39 and Madziva
et al.40 have observed similar release
profiles for FA at different pH. The higher release of FA at higher
pH could be ascribed to pH-dependent behavior of FA-loaded hydrogels.
More over FA shows more solubility with increasing pH.41 Thus, it can be suggested that loaded FA may
exhibit a scarce release in the acidic environment, that is, stomach,
but shows a higher release rate in the alkaline pH (pH 7.4) which
prevails in the small intestines, where its absorption takes place.
From cumulative release studies (Figure 11) it was observed that nearly about 78%
of FA was released in case of F1 at pH 7.4, followed by 68 and 28%
in F2 and F3 hydrogels, respectively. However, the % release of FA
was low in hydrogels at pH 2.1 which may be possibly due to lower
swelling ability of hydrogels at lower pH as confirmed from their
swelling behavior studies and lesser solubility of FA at low pH. Further,
it was also observed that higher release of FA occurs in the first
5 h at both pHs and then showed gradual increase up to 7 h. The highest
release of 21 and 78.87% of FA was observed in case of F1 hydrogel
after 1 and 5 h, respectively, at pH 7.4. This presents extended release
times as compared to that of commercially available FA tablets, which
at same time and pH showed a release rate of 60 and 90%. Other systems
used for FA delivery presented a range of release rate and time, depending
upon the materials used (Table 2).

The release mechanism
of FA from cross-linked hydrogels can be
predicted to take place in three steps (Figure 12). In the first step, the FA-loaded hydrogel
has lesser volume of water as a result of which the hydrogel shows
lower flexibility, small pore size, and limited FA mobility. In the
second step, diffusion of water takes place which causes relaxation
in the hydrogel, induces flexibility, and increases hydrogel pore
size, leading to the enhancement in the FA mobility. In the third
step, these hydrogels became fully hydrated and relaxed, increases
the rate of diffusion because of larger pore size.

Figure 12 Schematic representation
of the process of FA release from cross-linked
hydrogel.

The drug release from the matrix
of hydrogel generally occurs via
either non-Fickian, Fickian, or case II diffusion which relies upon
mechanical strength of hydrogels, their chemical properties, and external
stimulus.45 In order to study the FA transport
mechanism through cross-linked PVA hydrogels, different diffusion
models were applied for fitting the experimental date and among these
models, Korsmeyer-Peppas gives an idea of the FA release mechanism
through cross-linked PVA hydrogels, while as the Higuchi model explains
the release mechanism completely. For all cross-linked hydrogels (F1,
F2, and F3), the n values (Table 3) were found in between 0.51–0.78,
signifying that the release of FA from hydrogel takes place via non-Fickian
diffusion. It was also observed from R2 values (Table 3)
that FA release from cross-linked hydrogel follows the Higuchi model
which indicates that diffusion is responsible for release of FA from
these hydrogels. It can be clearly observed that at higher pH (7.4),
the n values more closely approach to 0.89 at which
the FA release is governed by the relaxation of hydrogels. The n values for cross-linked hydrogels are found to be smaller
at lower pH (Table 4) than at higher pH. This can be due to the collapsed form of these
hydrogels in acidic pH as a result of which the FA is unable to disseminate
fast from the hydrogel. Thus, it can be concluded that at lower pH
FA release depends less on hydrogel relaxation.

2.12 Photostability of FA-Loaded
Hydrogel
FA (Vit-B9) is vital ingredient required for all
living organisms.46 Human body is unable
to synthesis this vitamin;
thus, we depend entirely on our foods for its supply.47 FA deficiency may lead to various types of diseases such
as neural tube defects, Alzheimer’s disease, complications
related to pregnancy and cancers.48 It
is sensitive to UV radiations and acidic conditions, which cleave
the C9–N10 bonds to form biologically
inactive (p-amino benzoyl)l-glutamic acid
and pteridine.49 This may result in the
lower bioavailability of FA in food materials and thus large concentrations
are required to ensure good health of humans. Therefore, one of the
key purposes of this work was to investigate the photoprotection property
of FA-loaded hydrogels. The pure FA solution and the FA-loaded hydrogel
(F1) was subjected to UV radiation and their absorption spectra was
compared with the nonirradiated samples. The absorption spectra of
FA displayed two main peaks at 280 and 350 nm, which can be because
of the occurrence of pteridine and p-aminobenzoic
glutamate moieties.50 However, after 2
h of irradiation the FA spectrum changed, thus signifying degradation
of FA as shown in Figure 13. The absorption spectra of UV-irradiated free FA shows peaks
at 355, 310, and 272 nm which can be attributed due to the formation
of 6-formylpterin and pterine-6-carboxylic acid which are biologically
inactive photoproducts of irradiated FA.28 While as the UV–visible spectra of FA-loaded hydrogel did
not show any notable changes after 2 h of UV exposure.

spectra of pure FA and loaded FA before and after
UV irradiation.

3 Conclusions
The OGA was successfully synthesized through periodate oxidation
and used as an effective cross-linker for the formulation of cross-linked
PVA hydrogels. The swelling and release study of the said hydrogels
was performed. It was observed that the PVA-based hydrogels exhibited
higher swelling ratio at higher pH. While the release studies revealed
that the release rate of FA was found to be higher in F1 (78 and 32%)
as compared to F2 (69 and 22%) and F3 (30 and 18%) at pH 7.4 and 2.1,
respectively. The increase in the swelling ratio is due to the decrease
in cross-linking density of these hydrogels. The in vitro haemolytic
and cytotoxicity studies of hydrogels and FA-loaded hydrogels showed
biocompatible and nontoxic nature. Further, the hydrogels displayed
UV-photoprotection property and prevented the loaded FA from UV degradation.
These results suggest that these hydrogels may act as a promising
photoprotective material and are suitable candidates for sustained
delivery of FA.

4 Materials and Techniques
4.1 Materials
PVA (molecular weight =
85 000–124 000, degree of hydrolysis = 86–89%)
was procured from S.D. Fine Chemicals, Mumbai, India, GA (molecular
weight = 953 900 g/mol), hydroxy amine hydrochloride (NH2OH·HCl) ethylene glycol, sodium periodate (NaIO4), ethanol, sodium thiosulphate, hydrochloric acid (HCl), and sodium
hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from Merck. FA was obtained from CDH
Chemicals. These chemicals were used as such without further purification.

4.2 Synthesis of OGA
Oxidization of GA
was carried out to synthesize the cross-linker aldehyde GA (OGA) using
NaIO4 as oxidizing agent following reported in the literature.17 GA (1.0 g) was added in 20 mL of deionized water.
NaIO4 (0.5 g) was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water
and was added dropwise to the GA solution, then the reaction mixture
was allowed to stir in dark for 24 h at 20 °C. After, ethylene
glycol (5 mL) was added to the solution to neutralize the unreacted
periodate, finally, the reaction mixture was precipitated out by the
addition of excessive ethanol (150 mL) which was filtered, washed
several times with ethanol water mixture, and then subjected to freeze-drying
to obtain OGA powder. The oxidation degree was calculated with the
help of periodate that remain unreacted in the reaction mixture using
iodometric titration.17 Sodium bicarbonate
solution (10 mL) was used to neutralize the 5 mL aliquot from the
reaction mixture. The liberation of iodine occurs by adding 2 mL of
potassium iodide solution and 1 M sulphuric acid (5 mL) to the reaction
mixture. The solution was kept away from light in dark conditions
for 30 min and the periodate present in the reaction mixture was estimated
by titration of the liberated iodine with 0.1 N solution of sodium
thiosulphate in the presence of starch indicator.

4.3 Aldehyde Content Determination
The
aldehyde content of OGA was evaluated by the conversion of aldehyde
groups into oxime via Schiff base reaction with the help of hydroxylamine
hydrochloride.17 OGA (0.3 g) was dissolved
in 20 mL of deionized water (pH 5.0) then, 20 mL (0.72 mol/L) of NH2OH. HCl was mixed to this solution under stirring for 4 h
at 40 °C. The amount of HCl released was estimated by titrating
the solution with standard solution of NaOH (1.0 M) in the presence
of phenolphthalein as the indicator. The aldehyde content was calculated
using following equation 1  where V0 and Vb are the
volume of NaOH consumed in the presence
of OGA and blank, respectively. C is concentration
of NaOH, m is weight of OGA, and M is the approximate molecular weight of the monomeric OGA (162).17

4.4 Preparation of PVA Cross-linked
Hydrogels
Hydrogels were formed by the chemical cross-linking
involving the
aldehyde functionality of OGA and OH groups of PVA. Various concentrations
(30, 50, and 70 mg/mL) of OGA were dissolved in 10 mL of deionized
water and poured dropwise into 10% aqueous solution of PVA in the
presence of a catalyst (2 mL 1 M HCl). The mixtures were kept under
the slow and controlled stirring for 3 h at 60 °C and transferred
into the casting material. The casted hydrogel films were air-dried
at room temperature and washed thoroughly to remove the unreacted
material. The hydrogels prepared with 30, 50, and 70 mg/mL concentration
of OGA were named as F1, F2, and F3, respectively, while the pure
PVA film was formulated by dissolving PVA (1 g) in 10 mL of deionized
water on stirring for 3 h at 60 °C and then transferred to the
casting material for film formation. The pure PVA hydrogel film was
named as F0.

4.5 Characterizations
FTIR spectroscopy
(PerkinElmer Cetus Instruments, Norwalk) was used to identify the
aldehydic groups of OGA and acetal bond formation of cross-linked
PVA hydrogels. Proton NMR spectra (Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer, Billerica,
USA) of GA and OGA in D2O were obtained to investigate
the presence of aldehydic protons on OGA. The presence of aldehydic
carbon on OGA was confirmed using the solid-state 13C NMR
technique (JEOL, 400 MHz FT-NMR). XRD patterns of cross-linked hydrogels
were recorded with the help of Rigaku Ultima (IV) XRD (40 kV, Tokyo,
Japan) having a scanning speed of 8°/min with 2θ ranging
from 10° to 70°. To observe the morphology of hydrogels
in swelling, the samples were kept in double distilled water for 24
h and then dried in vacuum after that these were analyzed with Zeiss,
EVO 18 SEM instrument. The mechanical tests of the cross-linked PVA
hydrogel films in the swelling state were conducted using the universal
testing machine (Instron 8871) with the 10 N load cell. The hydrogel
films with thickness and width of 30–35 μm and 10 mm,
respectively, were used for mechanical studies. The tests were performed
in 25 °C and under the prestrain of 0.05–0.1 N. The samples
were conditioned in the measuring environment one day before their
testing. UV spectrophotometer (Lambda, 650) was used for the detection
of FA release behavior and to study the photoprotection property of
hydrogel samples. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting temperature (Tm) of F0 and cross-linked F1, F2, and F3 hydrogels were investigated
with the help of DSC (DSC-60 Plus, Shimadzu). These hydrogel samples
were analyzed between 0 and 250 °C temperature range under nitrogen
atmosphere with 10 °C/min of scanning rate.

4.6 Swelling Studies
The swelling behavior
of cross-linked hydrogel was determined gravimetrically in water by
evaluating their water uptake. Initially, these dried hydrogels were
weighed and immersed in 30 mL of double distilled water for different
periods at 25 °C. The hydrogels were taken out and blotted using
tissue paper to wipe off the surface water. The amount of water absorbed
by the hydrogels was determined with the help of following equation.11 2  where Ws and Wd and are weight of hydrogels in swollen and
dry states, respectively.

4.7 Determination of Molecular
Weight among Cross-links
(MC), Cross-linking Density (ρ), and Mesh Size (ξ)
The determination of MC, ρ, and ξ, these hydrogel samples
were cut instantly after cross-linking and weighed in heptane and
air. Afterward, these hydrogels were submerged in double distilled
water at room temperature till the equilibrium swelling was achieved,
then again weighed in heptane and air. Finally, these hydrogels were
dried in oven at 25 °C for 4 days and then again weighed in heptane
and air. From these weights, the hydrogel volume fraction can be calculated.18

From swelling data, the MC can be calculated
using following equation.19 3  where Mn represents
PVA number average molecular weight of before cross-linking (85 000), v is the specific volume of the polymer (0.788 cm3/g), v1 signifies the molar volume of
water (18.1 cm3/mol), v2, r denotes volume fraction of the cross-linked PVA hydrogel
in the relaxed state, v2,s is designated
as the volume fraction of the PVA hydrogel in the swollen form. χ
denotes the Flory PVA hydrogel–solvent interaction parameter
which is about 0.494 for PVA/water.

The ξ of hydrogel
is the linear distance among successive
cross-links. It represents the space that is available for the diffusion
of solute or drug molecules and can be calculated with the help of
following equation.20 4  where Cn is Flory ratio (8.3), l is the bond angle
between C–C bond (1.54 Å), Mr is the molecular weight
of repeating units of PVA, and MC represents molecular weight of cross-links.

The ρ of these hydrogels were determined with the help of
following equation.18 5  

4.8 Maintenance of Cell Line
The in vitro
biocompatibility of FA-loaded cross-linked PVA hydrogel having higher
loading percentage of FA (F1) was determined with the help of human
embryonic kidney cell line (HEK-2930). The epithelial morphological
cell line is a most extensively used cell line for the determination
of biocompatibility or cytotoxicity. The culturing of cells was carried
out using the T-25 culture flask in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (HiMedia) at 37 °C, which comprises penicillium/streptomycin
and 10% fetal bovine serum (HiMedia) and CO2 (5%) in a
humidified chamber (Nuaire, incubator, USA). Biocompatibilities of
F1 and F1-loaded FA were confirmed using MTT assay, which is considered
as the most active assay for conduction of biocompatibility under
in vitro conditions for any synthetic or biological materials.

4.9 MTT Assay of Hydrogels
In the evaluation
of biocompatibility through MTT assay, the FA-loaded hydrogels were
subjected to freeze-drying and then crushed using mortar and pestle.
The working solution of 1 mg/mL concentration was prepared by dispersing
the crushed powder of hydrogel films in distilled water. The prepared
samples were subjected to ultrasonication at high speed for about
1 h before their treatment with cells. The T-25 flask of HEK 293 cells
was trypsinized with the help of trypsin (0.25%) and the cells were
calculated with the help of the Neubauer chamber. Total of 1 ×
104 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate in a flat bottom.
The treatment was given after 24 h to these cells with the dose range
of 8–128 μg/mL for 48 h. After 48 h, the medium was removed
and cells were subjected to incubation in the presence of MTT solution
(5 mg/mL) at 37 °C for 4 h. Formazan crystals formed through
the reduction reaction of succinate dehydrogenase enzyme were dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide solution (150 μL). Furthermore, the absorbance
at 570 nm was recorded after incubation for 15 min using iMark microplate
(Bio-Rad, USA). Percentage of cell viability was evaluated as the
fraction of control.

4.10 Blood Compatibility by
Haemolytic Activity
The hemolytic assay for FA-loaded F1
hydrogel was performed by
following the reported protocol with slight modifications.21 Fresh human blood from a healthy donor was collected
in a centrifuge tube containing anticoagulant (ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid) and allowed for centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 15 min. The erythrocytes
were collected and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
(pH 7.4) three times. A 10% erythrocytes/PBS suspension was prepared
and 0.95 mL erythrocyte solution was taken in a 1.5 mL centrifuge
tube with 0.05 mL of the sample. Total hemolysis was achieved with
the help of 1% Triton X-100 as the positive control. These tubes were
kept for incubation for 1 h at 37 °C and then centrifuged at
2000 rpm for 10 min at 20 °C. The supernatant (150 μL)
was shifted to a flat-bottomed Bio-Rad microplate and the absorbance
at 570 nm was measured with the help of a UV–visible spectrophotometer.
These experiments were carried out in triplicates and their mean values
were considered.

4.11 Biodegradability Studies
Hydrolytic
degradation of hydrogels was conducted at pHs 7.4 at 25 °C. The
amount of weight loss of these cross-linked hydrogels was investigated
regularly at a definite interval of time (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...
20 days) with the help of the gravimetric technique. The degradability
tests were conducted in triplicate and average values were considered.
The ratio of degradability was determined by calculating the differences
of mass loss of these hydrogels by using the following equation.22 6  where We mass
loss of hydrogel and Wt is the equilibrium swollen states at time t.

4.12 FA Loading
Loading of FA in the
cross-linked PVA hydrogels was studied by immersing the preweighed
hydrogels in 30 mL of buffer solution (pH 7.4 and 2.1) containing
FA (5 mg/mL). After attaining the equilibrium degree of swelling,
FA-loaded hydrogel films were carefully removed and washed with PBS
followed by drying at 25 °C in a vacuum oven till the constant
weight was attained. The maximum FA loading was determined after 24
h, on attaining the yellow colored transparent hydrogels. The % FA
was calculated with the help of following equation.23 7  

4.13 In Vitro FA Release Study
The in
vitro release studies of FA were conducted by immersing the loaded
hydrogel (F1) in 10 mL solutions of pH 2.1 and 7.4 in a beaker for
24 h at 25 °C. At different intervals of time (1, 2, 4, 6, 9,
12 and 24 h), 5 mL solution was withdrawn followed by the addition
of the same volume of PBS solution in order to keep the constant volume
of solution same. The quantity of FA released was estimated by calculating
the absorbance of the solutions by a UV spectrophotometer. From the
spectra of standard FA solution of different concentrations, a calibration
curve was obtained. The FA release studies were carried out in triplicates
and their average values were considered using following equation.22 8  

4.14 FA Release
Kinetics and Various Mechanism
Models
The quantity of FA released from cross-linked PVA
hydrogels during different intervals of time were fitted using different
kinetic models such as zero order, first order, Korsmeyer–Peppas,
and Higuchi’s models to characterize release mechanism FA from
cross-linked hydrogels.

I. The zero-order kinetic model: it
represents the system in which the release rate does not depend on
the drug concentration24 9  where Qt represents the quantity of drug dissolved
in time t, Q0 is the
initial amount
of drug, and K0 is the release rate constant.

II. First order kinetics: it depicts the system in which the release
rate of drug depends on concentration of drug.25 10  where Qt represents
the dissolved amount of drug in time t, Q0 is the initial concentration of
drug, and K is the rate constant for release.

III. Higuchi model: it explains the fraction of drug released from
hydrogel directly related to the square root of time.26 11  where, M∞ and Mt is the cumulative
fraction of drug released during time t and KH is Higuchi constant.

IV. Korsmeyer–Peppas
model: this explains the fractional
amount drug release exponentially equal to drug release time.27 12  where, Mt/M∞ represents
fraction
release of drug during time t and K is the constant and n is the diffusional exponent.
The value of n is used for characterizing various
release processes. If n ≤ 0.45, then Fickian
diffusion predominates while the value of n in between n ≤ 0.45–0.89 designates non-Fickian or anomalous
diffusion and when N > 0.89, then case II diffusion
applies.

4.15 Photostability of FA
The photostability
of hydrogel-loaded FA was evaluated with the help of UV radiations
by employing a method reported in literature with minor modifications.28 The FA-loaded hydrogel (F1) (FA concentration
= 5 mg/mL) and free FA solutions with same concentration (pH 7.4)
were placed under a UV lamp (ULTRA-VITALUX 300 W, Osram) for 2 h.
The loaded hydrogel and free FA solution were placed at 20 cm distance
from the lamp. After 2 h, these samples were taken out and the-FA
loaded hydrogel was immersed in 5 mL of solution (pH 7.4). FA degradation
was studied by changes in the FA absorbance spectrum using the UV-spectrophotometer
(Lambda 650).
