In
this work, potassium fluoride-doped Ca–Mg–Al layered
double hydroxides (CaMgAl-LDHs) were synthesized by a coprecipitation
method, after which they were further used as strong adsorbents for
HCl gas adsorption in a quartz reactor at high temperature. The physiochemical
properties of the as-prepared KF/CaMgAl-LDHs and CaMgAl-LDHs were
investigated by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric, scanning electron
microscopy, energy-dispersive system, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller.
The HCl adsorption test showed that 25 wt % KF loading of the KF/CaMgAl-LDOs
was the optimal adsorbent for HCl removal. The highest adsorption
capacity of the KF/CaMgAl-LDH adsorbent was achieved with 0.2968 g
at 600 °C, 500 ppm HCl concentration, and 0.5 g adsorbent. Furthermore,
the microstructure of the adsorbents after the reaction revealed that
the adsorbents were encapsulated by dense chloride. The adsorption
process was mainly dominated by chemical adsorption, strong acid–base
properties, specific surface area, and mesopore number.

1 Introduction
Dioxins
are a kind of permanent organic pollutants, including polychlorinated
dibenzodioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans,1,2 with
municipal solid waste incineration being one of its main sources.3−5 A large number of incinerators encountered in the construction process
of “neighborhood avoidance” incidents have had its core
appeal to worrying about dioxin pollution. Previously reported results6−8 have shown that when the incineration temperature is above 850 °C
and the incineration time is over 2 s, the harmful substances will
basically decompose. However, when the temperature of the flue gas
drops to 200–400 °C, the HCl in the flue gas can be used
as a precursor to synthesize dioxins. Besides, the removal of dioxins
from the exhaust gas is difficult and unreliable; therefore, the best
way is to remove the core element Cl, which produces dioxins.9−13

The traditional HCl removal is often performed together with
desulfurization
and denitrification, Ca-based adsorbents are usually used at low temperature
(below 250 °C).14−16 The principle involves the acidic gases reacting
with active components in adsorbents to form stable metal compounds.
With the increasing importance of global and higher standards of environmental
protection, more and more attention has been drawn to the removal
of HCl in high-temperature areas. For example, Dou et al.17,18 investigated the reaction between solid sorbents and hydrogen chloride
gas at high temperatures in a fixed-bed reactor, with a large range
of adsorption temperatures for HCl removal being investigated, while
Chyang et al.19 showed that the HCl removal
capacity of CaO was largest at 650 °C. Moreover, Weinell et al.20 pointed out that both the two sorbents (slaked
lime and limestone) have the highest blinding capacities in the range
of 500–600 °C.

Generally speaking, Ca-based adsorbent
has a certain effect on
HCl removal at high temperature (600 °C), but the chlorine capacity
of the dechlorinating agent is relatively low, while the temperature
range is also narrow. Besides, the adsorption efficiency also decreased
obviously once the adsorption reaction deviated from the optimum temperature.

Hydrotalcite-like compounds are bimetallic hydroxides with a layered
microporous structure. The calcined products are characterized by
strong alkalinity and a large specific surface area, in addition to
exhibiting good performance as adsorbents, catalysts, and carriers.21,22 Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are currently receiving considerable
attention for a wide variety of applications in environmental remediation.
The compositions of LDHs have the general expression [M(II)1–xM(III)x(OH)2]x+(An–)x/n·mH2O, in which M(II) and M(III) are divalent and trivalent metallic
cations located in the main layer, An– is the interlayer anion, m is the number of interlayer
water molecules, and x is the molar ratio of M3+/(M2+ + M3+).23−27 The dechlorination performance and optimum ratio
of hydrotalcite-like compounds have been previously studied.28−30 Hydrotalcite-like composite is a good dechlorination adsorbent,
especially in the water environment, but its dechlorination characteristics
in a high-temperature gas environment are yet studied. In some literature
studies,31,32 the high-temperature dechlorination adsorbent
for hydrotalcite-like materials was studied, including the preparation
of the dechlorination adsorbent, adsorption test, cross-flow moving
bed reactor, and numerical simulation. It was generally considered
that the removal efficiency of HCl by a Ca–Mg–Al hydrothermal
liquefaction (HTL) adsorbent at high temperature was significantly
higher than that by CaO and NaHCO3 adsorbents. Also, Hu
et al.33 reported the preparation and dechlorination
performance of hydrotalcite-like adsorbents containing different metal
additions on the basis of the above, and considered that Ca-HTLs have
the best comprehensive dechlorination performance under various working
conditions. However, these works lack an in-depth study on the characteristics
of the hydrotalcite-like high-temperature dechlorination adsorbent,
especially for further improving the HCl adsorption at high temperatures.

With increasing attention toward global environmental protection,
the standard of environmental protection is also rising, with “near-zero-emission”
becoming the goal environmental protection workers strive to pursue.34 Therefore, it is more expedient and urgent to
study the adsorbents for the effective removal of HCl in the high-temperature
region. Furthermore, improvement of the adsorption capacity and efficiency
of HCl on the basis of existing Ca–Mg–Al hydrotalcite-like
materials is the technical route and innovation of this work. Potassium
fluoride is a white monoclinic, crystalline powder with a salty taste
and easy moisture absorption, with its aqueous solution being alkaline.
Previously reported results from Gao et al.35 confirmed that KF/HT is a highly effective catalyst for the transesterification
of palm oil with menthol.

The present work aimed at improving
the adsorption capacity of
Ca–Mg–Al hydrotalcite via modification with potassium
fluoride,36 afterward further used as the
adsorbent for HCl removal at high temperatures. Moreover, other parameters,
including temperature and HCl concentration affecting the adsorption
process, were also investigated. In addition, the microstructure and
physicochemical properties of the as-prepared samples were also characterized
by thermogravimetric (TG), scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive
system (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) methods. Finally, a mechanism for the HCl adsorption at high
temperature was proposed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the As-Synthesized Samples
The
X-ray diffraction patterns of CaMgAl-LDHs and 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDHs
are shown in Figure 1a. It can be clearly seen that both LDHs have diffraction peaks at
11.64, 23.42, and 35.44°, corresponding to (003), (006), and
(009) planes of MgAl-LDHs (JCPDS: 89-0460), respectively. Besides,
the crystal faces associated with CaAl-LDHs (JCPDS: 87-0493) were
detected at 2θ = 11.70° (011), 23.53° (022), 35.62°(033),
and 38.47° (114). This result indicated that the layered structure
was well-formed, and the characteristic structure consists of both
MgAl-LDHs and CaAl-LDHs. The in-plane diffraction peaks at 2θ
values of 60.76 and 62.10°, attributable to (110) and (113) planes
of pristine MgAl-LDHs, demonstrated that the synthesized samples possess
a good dispersion of metal ion crystallites and higher interlayer
regularity in the hydroxide layers. The thickness layer spacing of
the MgAl-LDHs is expressed by d003 (0.759
nm). According to the thickness value of a brucite-like layer (0.477
nm),38 the calculated gallery height is
approximately 0.282 nm. Since this height is comparable to the size
of carbanions, it suggests that the carbanions may be arranged in
a single layer between brucite-like layers. In addition, MgAl-LDHs
belongs to a hexagonal crystal, with the value of d110 spacing being 0.152 nm, while the calculated lattice
parameters are a = 2d110 (0.304 nm) and c = 3d003 (2.277 nm). After adding the KF solution, the structure of MgAl-LDHs
remains changed with the diffraction peaks of CaF2 being
observed additionally in the XRD diagram, a phenomenon, which indicated
that Ca2+ ions were in excess during the preparation process,
with only a limited amount of Ca2+ being completely associated
with the structural development into CaMaAl-LDHs.

Figure 1 X-ray diffraction patterns
of (a) CaMgAl-LDHs and 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDHs;
(b) CaMgAl-LDOs and 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDOs; and (c) recovered CaMgAl-LDOs
and 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDOs.

There are two different
kinds of calcium carbonate (calcite and
aragonite) within the synthetic CaMaAl-LDHs. Calcite is a kind of
calcium carbonate mineral, which as the most common natural calcium
carbonate, possesses good thermal stability, while aragonite has the
advantages of a higher specific surface area and higher solubility.

After calcining at 550 °C, all the samples were converted
into LDOs with the XRD patterns shown in Figure 1b. It can be observed that the three characteristic
peaks of MgAl-LDHs disappeared. Magnesium aluminum hydroxide (JCPDS:
035-0964) and calcium carbonate (JCPDS: 86-2334) consist of the major
components of CaMgAl-LDOs. Because both substances are strongly alkaline,
CaMgAl-LDOs, as a result, are very suitable as adsorbents for HCl
removal. Besides, KCaCO3F, as a newly formed substance,
was also detected by X-ray diffraction. There is a strong possibility
that the interlayer CO32– ions are spilled
over and captured by the active K+ ions, once LDH samples
are heated to about 400 °C. Importantly, LDOs loaded with potassium
fluoride possess better performance in HCl adsorption experiments,
which suggested that KCaCO3F played an important role in
this reaction. Furthermore, it can be seen that the product of HCl
adsorbed by CaMaAl-LDOs is only CaCl2·2H2O (Figure 1c). In
contrast, there are some other peaks attributable to chlorides in
the XRD pattern of 25% KF/CaMaAl-LDOs, as KCl and MgCl2 were both detected in the samples after the dechlorination reaction.
This can vividly explain that KF/CaMaAl-LDOs have better removal efficiency
than CaMaAl-LDOs at 600 °C. Therefore, it can be drawn that the
modification of LDHs by adding potassium fluoride is a better way
to improving dechlorination performance.

To characterize the
microscopic architectures and composition of
the LDHs and LDOs samples, SEM and EDS were employed with the results
being displayed in Figure 2. The SEM images of the pristine CaMgAl-LDHs and 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDHs
samples are presented in Figure 2a,b. The surface of both sorbents seems fluffy and
porous, with grain-like particles grown on the surface of the crystals.
In combination with the XRD diagram (Figure 1a), many agglomerated white particles were
obviously observed, as shown in Figure 2b, but not in Figure 2a. This substance most likely consisted of CaF2 after the addition of KF solution to the LDHs. As a result,
there is no obvious difference in the morphology of LDH samples after
the KF loading.

(c1–c2,
d1–d2) CaMgAl-LDOs and 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDOs; and (e1–e2,
f1–f2) recovered CaMgAl-LDOs and 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDOs.

Figure 2c,d reveales
the surface morphologies of the calcined LDHs at 550 °C. Compared
with the uncalcined LDHs as shown in Figure 2a,b, hexagonal and rhombohedral crystals
appeared in the LDOs samples. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) spectrum of CaMgAl-LDOs demonstrated the presence of Ca, Mg,
Al, and O elements within the solid, with the corresponding weight
percentages being 9.3, 17.1, 9.6, and 63.4%, respectively. This result
further corroborated the successful preparation of Ca–Mg–Al
metal oxides.

With the evaporation of water and evolution of
carbon dioxide,
some macropores gradually appeared; hence, HCl gas can easily enter
into the adsorbent through a macropore. After the adsorption test,
the hydrotalcite-like structure of CaMgAl-LDHs was almost destroyed
(Figure 2d), with an
inhomogeneous aggregation being observed, which is associated with
the heaping of tiny particles and bulky lumps. Moreover, many snowflake-like
villi were wrapped around the metal oxide crystals, which could play
a very positive role in promoting the formation of the pore structure
within the synthesized sample. Therefore, calcined hydrotalcite could
act as a better adsorbent for enhanced HCl removal.

The morphological
characteristics of the samples after the HCl
gas adsorption were quite different from the previous samples (Figure 2e,f). The entire
adsorbent surface is enclosed with numerous dense, translucent, and
glossy crystals. Thus, no particles can be seen from the SEM diagram.
Moreover, the XRD characterization showed that the recovered adsorbent
was mainly composed of CaCl2. The porous structure of LDOS
was completely blocked, hence could lead to complete failure of the
HCl adsorbent. Because of the strong water absorption of calcium chloride,
the samples formed a clear crystal morphology after being exposed
in air (Figure 2e),
with the EDS spectrograms of the two recovered samples displaying
strong Cl signals. This further proved that CaMgAl-LDOs and KF/CaMgAl-LDOs
are excellent HCl adsorbents (scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration for the Formation of KF/CaMgAl-LDO
Particles
The N2 adsorption
was carried out on the LDH and LDO
samples to evaluate their porosity. Both samples exhibited reversible
Type IV isotherms, revealing some mesoporous structures within the
as-synthesized materials. The surface areas of the three samples were
calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller model and
are shown in Table 1. It can be observed that the specific surface area and pore volume
of the sample obviously increase after calcination. In comparison
with the four types of hysteresis loops as classified by IUPAC, Figure 3a–c all show
that the hysteresis loop was Type H1, which reflects cylindrical
holes with uniform diameter distribution at both ends, and can be
used as a criterion to identify the mesoporous materials. This matches
well with the pore diameter sizes given in Table 1. The pore diameter of CaMgAl-LDOs after
the HCl adsorption reaction was reduced from 18.972 to 12.503 nm,
which is very close to that of CaMgAl-LDHs (11.634 nm).

The
thermal stability is also an important factor for evaluating
the synthesized samples. Thermal analysis of the uncalcined LDHs was
studied with the results shown in Figure 4. The TG and differential TG (DTG) curves
for the pyrolysis of the CaMgAl-LDHs and 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDHs were detected
at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under a nitrogen
atmosphere. The DTG curves of CaMgAl-LDHs displayed three weight loss
stages below 630 °C, as against two endothermic peaks in the
25% KF/CaMgAl-LDHs. Weight loss (5.1%) was detected for stage I, which
can probably be attributed to the evaporation of physically absorbed
water on the external surface.39 Potassium
fluoride has very strong water absorption and can turn the adsorbed
water into structural water, which requires higher temperature for
removal. This could be the reason 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDHs DTG curve does
not exhibit any endothermic peak in stage I. Moreover, the two DTG
curves have the same trend in stage II and stage III. stage II, with
two narrow peaks from 170 to 230 °C in the DTG curves, which
overlap with the first peak at 125 °C, can be ascribed to the
structural water intercalated in the interlayer galleries, as well
as a small loss of CO2.40 Moreover,
with the peak at 211 °C, 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDHs has more weight loss
than CaMgAl-LDHs. This further shows that the doped potassium fluoride
largely influences the increase of interlayer water. Stage III appeared
in the range of 240–420 °C with an obvious weight loss
at 320 °C, indicating that most of the carbonate anions decomposed
via the dehydroxylation of brucite-like sheets. Throughout the whole
stage, the weight loss of the 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDHs is very close to
the CaMgAl-LDHs, suggesting that the doped sample was also stable
during the adsorption test.

2.2 HCl Adsorption Capacity
of Various Sorbents
In this study, the operation conditions
of different load ratios
KF/LDOs on the effect of the HCl removal are listed in Table 2. It has been reported that
when waste incineration temperature reaches 850 °C, some harmful
substances can basically be decomposed in not more than 2 s during
the incineration time. When the tail flue gas temperature drops to
300–450 °C, the HCl as a precursor reactivates dioxins.
Therefore, the optimal temperature range for removing HCl at high
temperature should be between 450 and 800 °C. Therefore, this
work adopted 600 °C for further research. HCl concentration in
waste incineration flue gas ranges from hundreds to thousands of ppm.
However, with the advancement of garbage classification, the amount
of chlorine in domestic garbage decreases accordingly, hence, 500
ppm is selected as the appropriate concentration in this work.

Figure 5 shows the
total HCl capacities of KF/LDOs. It could be seen that the adsorption
capacity of 0% KF/LDOs is the least (0.200 g HCl/0.5 g sorbent), as
the HCl capacities were enhanced for all the samples with the increasing
mass ratio of KF, with 25% KF/LDOs showing the highest HCl capacity
(0.297 g HCl/0.5 g sorbent). Moreover, the penetration times of the
synthesized samples are 665, 730, 870, 980, 820, and 770 min, respectively,
with increasing weight percentages of KF. Compared with the other
sorbents, 25% KF/LDOs also exhibited the longest breakthrough time,
which illustrated that 25% KF/LDOs are an excellent and effective
sorbents for removing HCl. The breakthrough curves and removal efficiencies
of the worst and the best HCl adsorbents are shown in Figure 6. The removal efficiencies
of LDOs and 25% KF/LDOs can reach more than 95%, but the LDO sample
can only maintain such high levels for 40 min, while the removal efficiency
of 25% KF/LDOs can be prolonged to 133 min. The potassium fluoride-doped
CaMgAl-LDHs possesses better removal performance compared to the CaMgAl-LDH
sorbent, especially for the 25% KF per unit loading sample. Hence,
25% KF/CaMgAl-LDH was chosen as the optimal adsorbent for further
studies.

loading of 0.5 g, 600 °C, HCl concentration of 500 ppm).

Figure 6 Breakthrough curves of CaMgAl-LDOs and 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDOs.

The results of the temperature effects on HCl removal
are shown
in Figure 7. It can
be observed that the adsorption capacity of the 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDHs
was initially enhanced from 0.2784 g (550 °C) to 0.2968 g (600
°C), followed by a continuous decrease to 0.2661 g (800 °C)
with increasing temperature. This may be due to the increased temperature
causing the 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDHs to be activated for an easy adsorption
process to occur. When the temperature was above 600 °C, the
structure of 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDHs became damaged, leading to the loss
of the adsorption sites. Hence, 600 °C can be considered as the
optimal adsorption temperature for HCl removal.

Figure 7 Effects of temperature
on the HCl removal (adsorbent loading of
0.5 g, HCl concentration of 500 ppm).

To further explore the HCl concentration affecting the adsorption
process, HCl concentration was increased from 250 to 1000 ppm, and
the results are displayed in Figure 8. Interestingly, the final adsorption capacities were
equal to a constant for the various HCl concentrations, and the higher
the HCl concentration, the shorter the time was required. This result
indicated that the HCl concentration was not the determining factor
for final adsorption capacity, implying that the HCl removal is attributed
to chemical adsorption.

Figure 8 Effects of HCl concentration on the removal
process.

To study the kinetics in the adsorption
process, the isotherm adsorption
was carried out with the results shown in Figure 9a, while the corresponding kinetic curve
is plotted in Figure 9b. It can be seen from the kinetic curve that the HCl removal is
very close to the first-order adsorption kinetics.

HCl removal process.

3 Conclusions
In this study, the potassium fluoride (KF) doped Ca–Mg–Al
layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were synthesized, and further converted
into KF/Ca–Mg–Al layered double oxides (LDOs) via calcination.
The doped samples exhibited enhanced HCl removal capacity compared
to CaMgAl-LDOs. Moreover, 25% KF/CaMgAl-LDOs was optimized as the
best adsorbent, with the best adsorption capacity achieved with 0.2968
g under optimal reaction parameters (600 °C, 500 ppm HCl concentration,
0.5 g adsorbent). In addition, the neutralization reaction is predominant
for the removal of HCl by CaMgAl-LDOs according to the characterization
results from TG, XRD, SEM, and BET, hence, the proportion of chemical
adsorption is more important than that of physical adsorption. Furthermore,
CaMgAl-LDHs possess good mechanical strength and sintering resistance
when comparing the adsorbent sample after the reaction.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Experimental
Facilities
Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, NaOH, Na2CO3, and KF·2H2O were all purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.
(Shanghai, China). All of the chemicals were of analytical grade reagents
and used without further purification. Milli-Q water was procured
from Shenzhen Yiliyuan Water Treatment Equipment Co. Ltd., while hydrogen
chloride (3000 ppm) and nitrogen (99.999%) cylinder gas were obtained
from Nanjing Shangyuan Gas Product Co. Ltd. A DF-101S collector with
constant heating, charged magnetic stirrer and filled with methyl
silicone oil was used as the heating source in the synthesis process,
while a water-circulation multifunction vacuum pump used in the drainage
and filtration process was supplied by Henan Yuhua Experimental Instruments
Co. Ltd.

4.2 Synthesis of Ca–Mg–Al LDHs Sorbents
The Ca–Mg–Al LDHs were synthesized by the traditional
coprecipitation method. Solution A was prepared by dissolving Na2CO3 (1.5 mol) and NaOH (2.0 mol) in 400 ml Milli-Q
water, while Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (0.4
mol), Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0.4 mol),
and Solution B were prepared by dissolving Al(NO3)3·9H2O (0.2 mol) in 300 mL Milli-Q water. A
four-necked flask containing 100 mL ultra-pure water was fixed in
an oil bath filled with methyl silicone oil. The two solutions (Solution
A and Solution B) were simultaneously poured into two 500 mL pear-shaped
separator funnels, which were thereafter inserted into two symmetrical
inlets of flasks. The other two flasks were charged with a PTFE agitator
and a pH meter (Sinomeasure, SIN-pH6.0). The pH of the mixture within
the flask was maintained at about 10.5. The resulting slurry was continuously
stirred at 65 °C for 24 h and then kept unstirred for another
12 h. Thereafter, the obtained slurry was filtered and washed continuously
with deionized water until the pH reached 7. Subsequently, the precipitates
were dried at 95 °C for 12 h to eliminate redundant water, and
the final obtained sample was named CaMgAl-LDHs.

Five beakers
containing an average 20 g of hydrotalcite-like samples were poured
into KF·2H2O solution with the ratios of 5, 10, 25,
50, and 100% (w/w HT) while adding 100 mL Milli-Q water into each.
Thereafter, all the precipitates were heated at 150 °C until
the sample was steam dried. The dried solid was further treated at
95 °C for 12 h, and finally calcined at 550 °C for 5 h to
get converted into KF/CaMgAl mixed oxides. The calcined KF-doped LDH
(hereafter referred to as LDOs) samples were ground and sieved to
0.180–0.355 mm, after which they were further used for the
dechlorination performance test.

4.3 Characterization
The phase components
and crystalline structure of the synthesized adsorbent and recovered
samples were determined by a Rigaku Smartlab X-ray diffractometer
(XRD) at a scanning rate of 10° min–1 using
Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 100 mA, λ = 0.154056 nm) in a
2θ range from 5 to 80°, while the surface morphologies
of LDHs and LDOs were observed using a scanning electron microscope
(SEM, Hitachi Regulus 8220) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray
spectrometer (EDS, Oxford Instruments Ultim Extreme) at an accelerating
voltage of 15 kV. Moreover, thermal gravimetric analysis (TG, NETZSCH
STA 449F3) was used to investigate the thermal properties of CaMgAl-LDH
and KF/CaMgAl-LDH samples at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 from room temperature to 650 °C under a N2 atmosphere,
while the specific surface area and pore-size distribution were obtained
using Brunauere–Emmette–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) methods.37 The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
measurements were performed on a physisorption BELSORP-mini (Microtrac
BET, Japan) instrument at 77 K.

4.4 Hydrogen
Chloride Removal Experiment
It has been previously reported
that the hydrotalcite-like oxides
were found to possess excellent adsorption capacity in the removal
of HCl. In the adsorption performance system, HCl and N2 cylinders were controlled with a separate mass flowmeter (Beijing
HORIBA METRON Instruments Co. Ltd.). The assessment of KF/CaMgAl-LDOs
for dechlorination capacity was conducted on a vertical fixed quartz
tubular bed (20 mm in diameter, 500 mm in length). In each experiment,
0.5 g KF/CaMgAl-LDOs was placed evenly on a 200-mesh stainless steel
wire at the center of a quartz glass tube. After the pipeline leak
detection was completed, the furnace was heated to 600 °C under
a nitrogen atmosphere at a rate of 0.75 L min–1.
The reactor was thereafter heated to the target temperature, followed
by the opening of the solenoid valve for the HCl gas with the mass
flowmeter set at a rate of 0.15 L min–1. The total
flow rate (0.9 L min–1) of the mixed gases contained
the initial HCl concentration (500 ppm). The hot, mixed gases passed
through the sample, followed by condensation and drying, and then
detection by the HCl infrared analyzer. The residual HCl concentration
was determined and recorded by a Model 7900FM HCl GFC analyzer online.
The exhaust gas was then released to open space through the NaOH solution.
The experiment was carried out until the concentration of HCl in the
outlet gases reaches the inlet content (500 ppm). The removal efficiencies
and the HCl adsorption capacity were calculated using eqs 1 and 2, respectively. 1   2  where η stands for
the removal efficiency of the sorbent, Cin and Cout are the concentration of HCl
(ppm) in the inlet and out gases, qT represents the mass of HCl adsorbed by the LDOs from time
0 to T (g), T is the reaction time
of dechlorination process (min), V denotes the flow
velocity of the mixed gases (L min–1), and M is the relative molecular mass of HCl (46).
