In
this work, SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were integrated
into the mesoporous TiO2 layer of a perovskite solar cell
to investigate their effect on cell performance. Different concentrations
of SiO2/ethanol have been combined in TiO2/ethanol
to prepare pastes for the fabrication of the mesoporous layer with
which perovskite solar cells have been fabricated. Addition of SiO2 NPs of 50 and 100 nm sizes produces an enhancement of cell
performance mainly because of an improvement of the photocurrent.
This increment is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions
based on light scattering induced by dielectric SiO2 NPs.
The samples using modified scaffolds with NPs also present a significant
lower current–potential hysteresis indicating that NP incorporation
also affects the ion accumulation at the perovskite interface, providing
an additional beneficial effect. The results stress the importance
of the appropriated management of the optical properties on further
optimization of perovskite solar cell technology.

1 Introduction
Ever
since the seminal reports in sensitized1,2 and
in all-solid solar cell configurations,3,4 halide perovskites
have been widely investigated as light harvesters in solar cells because
of their optimal properties, including direct band gap, large absorption
coefficients, and high carrier mobility.5 Indeed, the significant work carried out in the research resulted
in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs)
close to 23%.6 The main strategy to enhance
PCE has been the optimization of the deposition process and of the
halide perovskite harvester by the use of multication/anion perovskites.7−11 However, other strategies have been employed including the incorporation
of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), increase of the thickness of the
absorbing material, adding scattering layers, or the use of back reflectors
and other light-trapping mechanisms.12−14 In these cases, the
improvement on solar cell performance is attained by the management
of the optical properties of the device. For example, deposition of
gold and silver NPs is a common approach because of their high (and
size tuned) scattering and absorption cross-sections.15 They have also been shelled with SiO216−18 to protect them from the corrosive effect of iodine and incorporated
in the architecture of PSCs, observing an enhancement of the device
performance.17 Theoretical studies predict
that core–shell Au/SiO2 NPs provide optical absorption
enhancement in PSCs in spectral regions where the perovskite material
has relatively poor absorption.19−21 It is suggested that this enhancement
is mainly based on a plasmonic effect, but it is not the only way
in which Au/SiO2 NPs can help to enhance the PSC performance.
Recently, we have used Au/SiO2 NPs with a smaller Au core
than required to produce significantly enhanced light absorption due
to the near-field plasmonic effect.8 However,
we have observed an increase of cell performance by modification of
the interfacial properties.22 Light scattering
is also a way in which light harvesting can be improved because of
the light-trapping enhancement. Nanopatterned mp-TiO2 layers
enhance the light-harvesting efficiency of PSCs.23 In addition, the high scattering efficiency observed for
big Au/SiO2 NPs demonstrates to be an effective way of
improving light harvesting because of the redirection of the incident
light into solar cells with increased optical path lengths (light-trapping
effect).24−27 In terms of material preparation process and cost, the total elimination
of Au can be highly interesting if SiO2 dielectric NPs
could also induce a beneficial role on PSCs. The use of a mesoporous
layer of SiO2 instead of the conventional TiO2 has been investigated.28 However, the
record performance for PSCs has always been reported with a TiO2 mesoporous layer.7−11 Here, we propose further enhancement of the TiO2 mesoporous
scaffold by the introduction of SiO2 NPs on it.

In
this study, we synthesized SiO2 NPs, incorporating
them within the mesoporous TiO2 layer to fabricate PSCs.
The cell structure was fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/compact TiO2/TiO2 mesoporous containing SiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Figure 1). Two different sizes of SiO2 NPs, 50 and 100 nm, and different concentrations within the
mesoporous layer were tested to exploit the effect of these NPs in
the solar cell performance.

layer is modified with SiO2 NPs. Compact TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD as electron and hole selective contacts, respectively.

2 Experimental Procedure
2.1 Synthesis of SiO2 NPs
The sol–gel
method was used for the synthesis of SiO2 NPs with diameters
of 50 and 100 nm by hydrolyzing tetraethylorthosilicate
(TEOS) in a mixture of ethanol, water, ammonia, and a surfactant.
TEOS, ethanol, and ammonia were used as the silica precursor, the
common solvent, and the catalyst, respectively. Typically, 5.5 mL
of ethanol, 11 mL of deionized water, and 0.8 mL of ammonia were mixed
and stirred at 30 °C (for 100 nm SiO2 NPs) or 40 °C
(for 50 nm SiO2 NPs). At the same time, a solution containing
5.5 mL of ethanol and 1.7 mL of TEOS was prepared and stirred at 30
°C (for 100 nm SiO2 NPs) or 40 °C (for 50 nm
SiO2 NPs). Then, the latter was added to the first solution,
and the reaction mixture was maintained at 30 or 40 °C (depending
on the desired particle size) for 2 h. During this time, the reaction
turned turbid slowly because of the formation of silica NPs. Once
the reaction was completed, 3-amino-propyltriethoxysilane was added
dropwise to stabilize the particles. The resulting solution was heated
at 80–90 °C to remove the excess of ammonia. The precipitate
was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with water
and ethanol; then, it was dried overnight at 100 °C. Figures S1 and S2 show the transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of the SiO2 NPs with 50 and 100
nm sizes, respectively.

2.2 Cell Fabrication
PSCs were fabricated
in a structure based on FTO glass substrates, which were partially
etched using HCl and zinc powder, cleaned with soap and deionized
water, sonicated in a mixture of acetone/ethanol and then in acetone/isopropyl
alcohol, and dried with compressed air. The substrates were then treated
by an ultraviolet–ozone lamp for 15 min. To prepare the TiO2 blocking layer (bl-TiO2), titanium diisopropoxide
dis(acetylacetonate) in ethanol (1:9, v/v) was deposited by spray
pyrolysis at 450 °C, and then the film was annealed at 450 °C
for 30 min in air. SiO2 (0.4 mg) powder in 10 mL of ethanol
was stirred for 1 night. Different concentrations of SiO2 solution (0, 10, 20, and 50 μL) were combined with a dilute
commercial TiO2 paste (30NRT) in ethanol (1:5 weight ratio).
Then, the SiO2/TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer
was deposited on the bl-TiO2 layer by spin-coating at 2000
rpm for 10 s. After drying at 100 lC for 10 min, it was annealed in
air up to 500 aC for 30 min. Lithium bis-(strifluoromethanesulfonamide)
(Li-TFSI, 35 mM) solution in acetonitrile was deposited on the substrates
by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 10 s. This Li-TFSI deposition has
been performed for samples using SiO2 with 50 nm, but not
for 100 nm, to rule out the influence of treatment instead of NP incorporation.
Then, the substrates were annealed at 450 PC for 30 min.29 PbI2 (622 mg) and 105 mg of dimethyl
sulfoxide were mixed in 944 mg of dimethylformamide (DMF) solution
inside a glovebox. This solution was heated at 65 oC and then mixed
into 214 mg of CH3NH3I. The completely dissolved
solution was spin-coated on the substrate layer at 4000 rpm for 50
s. Also, on the rotating substrate, diethyl ether was dripped, which
caused rapid vaporization of DMF. Then, the deposited film was heated
at 100 wC to obtain a dense CH3NH3PbI3 film. Then, 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution
(520 mg/mL of Li-TFSI in acetonitrile) were dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene
and deposited on the perovskite layer as a hole-transfer layer by
spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the electrode contacts
(60 nm Au) were deposited on the cells by thermal evaporation in a
high vacuum chamber.

2.3 Characterization
The current–voltage
(J–V) curves were obtained
with a scan rate of 50 mV/s in an Abet Technologies Sun 2000 Class
A AM 1.5G solar simulator with a Keithley 2612 Source Meter, where
the light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si solar
cell with a KG-5 filter to 1 sun of intensity (100 mW/cm2) in the Institute of Advanced Materials (INAM) at Universitat Jaume
I. The measurements were performed using a shadow mask with an area
of 0.101 cm2. Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra
were recorded by using a Cary 500 Scan VARIAN spectrophotometer in
the 250–800 nm wavelength range. Impedance spectroscopy measurements
were performed using an Autolab PGSTAT-30 instrument equipped with
a frequency analyzer module at 0.1 sun light illumination. The dc
bias was selected at 0 V, and the ac perturbation was 60 mV covering
the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The integration time was 0.125
s, and the number of cycles was equal to one.

3 Results and Discussion
To demonstrate the effect of SiO2 NPs on the PSC performance,
the fabricated cells were tested (with different concentrations and
sizes of SiO2) under 1 sun condition in air. Figures 2 and 3 show the dependence of the average device performance parameters
when the concentration of SiO2 NPs, with 100 and 50 nm
sizes, respectively, varies from 0 to 10 and 50 μL. To ensure
reliability, at least 15 devices were made for each concentration,
but usually more devices are prepared in a single condition. We have
analyzed several batches at each condition, and two operators prepared
the devices to avoid dispersion from batch to batch, independent of
the skill of a single operator. No cell was ruled out of the analysis
despite some batches presenting a significant lower performance than
the average. This procedure implies the preparation of a large amount
of samples, as we have prepared in this work, to have a confidence
interval as high as 90%, where no overlap is observed between the
intervals for the samples having the highest PCE and the reference,
as we show in Figures S3 and S4, making
the study statistically meaningful. The boxplot featuring the short-circuit
current density (Jsc), open circuit potential
(Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE of all
of the cells with different SiO2 NP concentrations are
compared in Figures 2 and 3. Clearly, the addition of SiO2 NPs demonstrates an increase in the Jsc and hence in the PCE. In particular, the highest PCE for samples
containing 50 and 100 nm size SiO2 NPs embedded in the
TiO2 mesoporous scaffold was achieved by using 20 and 10
μL solutions, respectively. No significant variation in light
absorbance was observed after the addition of SiO2 NPs,
see Figure S5.

PCE. Concentration is indicated in μL of a solution of 0.4 mg
of SiO2 powder in 10 mL of ethanol.

The values of the photovoltaic parameters for the cells with
the
highest PCE with different SiO2 NP concentrations and sizes
are summarized in Table 1. Again, the cells with NPs exhibit higher photovoltaic parameters.
Clearly, the observed PCE enhancement for the device incorporating
SiO2 NPs mainly comes from the great improvement of Jsc because the Voc and FF exhibit only a slight change. The maximum PCE of the devices
without NPs reaches 15.04%, whereas the maximum PCE of those incorporating
the NPs reaches 16.51 and 16.71% for sizes of 50 and 100 nm, respectively.
The J–V curves of these champion
cells are plotted in Figure S6.

To highlight the cause of the observed enhancement
of PCE performance,
the optical properties of the mesoporous scaffold have been theoretically
analyzed to calculate the effect of incorporation of SiO2 NPs of different sizes. The obtained results are consistent with
the scattering of SiO2 NPs inside the TiO2 scaffold
calculated by the Mie theory.30 First,
the scattering cross-section (σscattering) of a SiO2 NP immersed in the TiO2 bulk matrix induces a
clear scattering enhancement by increasing the size (radius) of the
NP, as illustrated in Figure 4a. This behavior agrees with previous calculations carried
out with metal NPs in polymer media15 and
can qualitatively explain the enhancement of the solar cell efficiency
when 100 nm size SiO2 NPs are used inside the TiO2 scaffold. Moreover, the dependence of the scattering as a function
of the filling factor (FF, volume of SiO2 inside the TiO2 matrix) will exhibit an optimum concentration, as presented
in Figure 4b for a
size of 100 nm. Here, it was important to take into account the mesoporous
nature of TiO2: it seems that for low concentrations, SiO2 is totally covered by TiO2, whereas for a high
FF, the NPs “can see” the influence of the air present
in the porous layer, and an effective index medium has to be considered.15 Under these conditions, σscattering decreases for large concentrations, where the effective refractive
index of the matrix will approach that of SiO2. Nevertheless,
because the total scattering is proportional to the number of NPs
(and hence, FF), there is an optimum concentration that maximizes
the scattering of light and, with it, the efficiency of the solar
cell (see Figure 4b).
In addition, other effects such as the improvement of the contact
between the perovskite and the mesoporous layer by the presence of
large size SiO2 NPs can also contribute for enhancing the
PSC performance.

Figure 4 (a) Integrated scattering cross-section as a function
of the size
of the SiO2 NP inside the TiO2 matrix. (b) Integrated
scattering cross-section per FF as a function of FF. Size was fixed
to 100 nm.

On the other hand, the enhancement
on cell performance observed
when 100 nm NPs are used instead of 50 nm NPs is significantly more
moderate than that expected from the theoretical analysis, as highlighted
in Figure 4a. Here,
it is worthy to note that the thickness of the scaffold, ∼200
nm, is of the same order as the SiO2 NP size, and consequently
an excessive increase of the NP concentration would affect seriously
the morphology of this layer and even light transmission, effects
that were not considered in Figure 4.

The PCE enhancement achieved, according to Table 1, was 9 and 14% for
NPs 50 and 100 nm in
diameter, respectively, which can be explained as a consequence of
the light-trapping effect of the NPs. These NPs act like mirrors inside
of the mesoporous layer; the sunlight is scattered on it, enabling
a longer optical path length, and thereby a higher amount of light
is absorbed by the perovskite. One of the most interesting characteristics
of the method proposed here to enhance the PCE is the fact that this
TiO2–SiO2 nanocomposite is obtained through
a simple mixing step, indicating the feasibility of the proposed method
easily upscalable. There are other light-trapping mechanisms, as nanotextures,31 that theoretically can achieve a higher enhancement,
but require a complicated fabrication method that is difficult to
transfer to industrial applications.

It is well-known that the
mesoporous scaffold also plays an important
role in the recombination and decrease of hysteresis.8,32 In addition to the increase of PCE with the incorporation of SiO2, a significant decrease in the J–V hysteresis is observed, see Figure 5 and Table 2. The forward and reverse sweeps of the J–V curve for reference devices
with no SiO2 and for devices with SiO2 NPs of
50 nm are summarized in Table S1. The hysteresis
index (HI) has been quantified by calculating as follows33 1  where JRev(Voc/2) and JFor(Voc/2) are the
currents when half of the Voc voltage
is applied for reverse (from Voc to zero)
and forward (from zero to Voc) voltage
scans, respectively. A HI of 0 corresponds
to a cell without significant hysteresis, whereas a HI of 1 corresponds
to a system in which the hysteresis is as high as the photocurrent.

Different aspects contribute to hysteresis in PSCs,
among them,
ion migration and accumulation at perovskite interfaces is one of
the most influencing ones.34 One easy way
to weigh the effect of ion accumulation is by open circuit voltage
decay (OCVD) measurements.35 Light soaking
produces an accumulation of ions at the interface. This charge accumulation
causes an electrostatic potential adding its value to the built-in
potential from the Voc. After switching
off the illumination in OCVD measurements, two regimes are observed.
First, a fast decrease is observed as the built-in potential induced
by carrier photogeneration is quickly removed. For longer times, a
significantly slower decay is observed as the elimination of the electrostatic
potential is related with the slow ion migration that removes the
ion accumulation. OCVD measurements for PSCs with and without SiO2 NPs are plotted in Figure 6. Although both kinds of samples present the same behavior
in the fast decay regime, a clear difference is observed in the slow
decay regime. Samples with SiO2 NPs are able to remove
the electrostatic potential induced by ion accumulation faster than
reference cells, pointing to a lower ion accumulation and/or a faster
dynamic in samples with SiO2 NPs. In this sense, the addition
of SiO2 NPs is not just affecting the optical properties
of the mesoporous scaffold but also affecting the ion migration properties
of the perovskite deposited in it. Alternatively, ion accumulation
was also monitored by the low-frequency capacitance.32,36−38 Samples with SiO2 NPs present lower low-frequency
capacitance, see Figure S7, pointing to
a lower ion accumulation in good agreement with the OCVD measurements.

cells with and without NPs (50 nm SiO2).

4 Conclusions
SiO2 NPs with 50 and 100 nm sizes have been integrated
into a conventional mesoporous TiO2 layer of the PSCs,
observing an enhancement of cell performance up to 14%, in comparison
with reference samples, mainly because of an increase in the photocurrent.
These results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions
based on the increase of light scattering induced by the presence
of SiO2. Light scattering is favored by the increase of
the NP size. However, as the size that is able to produce significant
scattering is comparable with the optimum mesoporous layer thickness,
other aspects such as the layer morphology, the loss in transparency,
and the reduction of the effective refractive index have to be properly
balanced to optimize the SiO2 concentration in the mesoporous
scaffold. The addition of SiO2 NPs also affects the ion
accumulation at the perovskite interfaces, causing an additional beneficial
effect, reducing the cell hysteresis significantly. Here, we show
a method, easy to implement, to increase the PSC performance by the
modification of the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold with the addition
of dielectric SiO2 NPs, pointing concretely to the development
of new mesoporous layers as a way to further increase the performance
of PSCs. Optimization of optical properties has allowed the latest
improvement in performance in very high-efficient GaAs solar cells
and has to be necessarily considered as the reported efficiency of
the photovoltaic technology is approaching the Shockley–Queisser
limit, as it is the case for PSCs.
