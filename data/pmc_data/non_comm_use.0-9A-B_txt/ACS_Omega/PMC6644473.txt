A series
of new semifluorinated polyimide (PI) films with phosphaphenanthrene
skeleton were prepared by thermal imidization of poly(amic acid)s
derived from a diamine monomer: 1,1-bis[2′-trifluoromethyl-4′-(4″-aminophenyl)phenoxy]-1-(6-oxido-6H-dibenz⟨c,e⟩⟨1,2⟩oxaphosphorin-6-yl)ethane
on reaction with four structurally different aromatic dianhydrides.
The chemical structures of the polymers were established by Fourier
transform infrared and 1H NMR spectroscopy techniques.
The polymers showed a good combination of thermal and mechanical properties
(Td10 up to 416 °C under synthetic
air and tensile strength up to 91 MPa), low dielectric constant (2.10–2.55
at 1 MHz), and Tg values as high as 261
°C. Gas permeabilities of these films were investigated for four
different gases CO2, O2, N2, and
CH4. The PI films showed high gas permeability (PCO2 up to 175 and PO2 up to 64 barrer) with high permselectivity
(PCO2/PCH4 up to 51 and PO2/PN2 up to 7.1), and
the values are better than those of many other similar polymers reported
earlier. For the O2/N2 gas pair, the PIs (PI
A) surpassed the present upper boundary limit drawn by Robeson. A
detailed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study has been conducted
to understand better the gas-transport properties. The effect of phosphaphenanthrene
skeleton, its spatial arrangement, and size distribution function
of the free volume were studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
and the results are correlated with the experimental data.

Introduction
Membrane-based
separation technology plays a key role in many industrial
and scientific areas as it offers many advantages over other technologies.1−5 Therefore, gas separation using polymer membranes has successfully
been employed in a variety of applications like O2 or N2 enrichment of air (separation of air for O2 enrichment
in combustion processes or medical applications and N2 enrichment
for prevention of oxidation), natural gas “sweetening”
(removal of CO2), hydrogen recovery from ammonia manufacture
(separating H2 from N2), and postcombustion
capture of CO2 (separating CO2 from N2).6−9 However, large precursor material associated with high production
cost, difficulties in obtaining highly pure product, and inadequate
thermal and chemical stabilities of many polymer membranes in separation
condition are the main reasons that limited the full development of
membrane-based separation applications.4 Additionally, high-efficiency gas separation demands such kind of
membrane materials that possess good selectivity for one gas over
another, along with high permeability. Higher permeability decreases
the amount of membrane area required to treat a given amount of gas,
thereby decreasing the capital cost of membrane units. Higher selectivity
results in higher-purity product gas.10 Nevertheless, there exist a trade-off relation between permeability
(P) and selectivity (α), i.e., polymer membranes
with high permeability usually display poor selectivity and vice versa.11,12 This point was first recognized by Robeson with Freeman, and a theoretical
basis for this behavior was developed later.10,12,13 Generally, polymers used for commercial
gas-separation membranes like Matrimid or Ultem possess high selectivity,
but low permeability.14 Thus, the key paradigm
of our research interest is designing new polymeric membranes with
both high permeability and permselectivity for the different gas pairs
(CO2/CH4, O2/N2, etc.)
with good thermal, mechanical, and chemical stabilities. This attempt
led the researchers to thoroughly examine the chemical and physical
properties of the polymers, which are essential to separate a particular
gas mixture.15

Practically, there
is no “design rule” for optimal
gas permeation and its relationship with polymer chemical structure.16 But several studies have reported12,16−18 structural modification through comparatively rigid
structure that leads to increase in fractional free volume (FFV) (by
disrupting chain packing via introducing bulky groups to increase
interchain spacing) and reduces rotational agility around flexible
linkages, which helped in improving both permeability and permselectivity.
Additionally, for practical application, the polymer membrane must
be thermally, mechanically, and chemically stable.19

In this context, aromatic polyimides (PIs) are well
known as high-performance
membrane materials due to their strong size-sieving ability as well
as excellent mechanical, thermal, and chemical stabilities and structural
diversity.20−22 Moreover, polyimides exhibit good selectivity for
a number of gas pairs (e.g., CO2/CH4, H2/CH4, H2/CO, O2/N2, etc.). Therefore, polyimides are a good choice for membrane-based
gas-separation applications.14 However,
their insolubility in common organic solvents and infusible nature
prevents membrane preparation by both solution casting and melt processing
routes.19 Numerous studies have been carried
out to adjust the interchain interaction of polyimides so that they
can be easily processed by either solvent casting or melt processing.23 These studies lead toward the modification of
the polymer backbone by introducing a bulky substituent, fluorine-containing
unit, flexible linkage, etc. In this respect, phosphorus-functionalized
polymers in the phosphinate form have drawn attention because of their
improved thermal properties and low flammability.24 Recently, polymers containing 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene
10-oxide (DOPO) have received much attention. This bulky structure
is free of conformational stress and prevents packing of polymer chains.
A large number of compounds with phosphaphenanthrene skeleton were
produced by reacting the active hydrogen of DOPO with several of electron-deficient
compounds.25 DOPO moieties in polyimide
chain improve polymer solubility, thermal stability, and flame retardancy.26,27 Additionally, introduction of pendant trifluoromethyl (−CF3) groups hinders close packing of the polymer chains, which
leads to increase of free volume as a result gas permeability increase
and improvement of the processibility of polyimides.19 Accounting both high permeability and selectivity, fluorinated
polymers are superior contenders in comparison to nonfluorinated ones.28 Fluorine-containing polymers are also known
for low dielectric constant, low water absorption, and high optical
transparency. Recently, our group has reported the gas-transport properties
of polyamides with phosphaphenanthrene skeleton with high gas permeability.29

In the present study, we report the synthesis
of a series of new
polyimides with phosphaphenanthrene group and their thorough characterization
by spectroscopic methods like 1H NMR and Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies. Thermal, mechanical, and gas-transport
properties of the polymers were also investigated. To understand the
performance of polymers as gas-separation membranes, the gas permeability
values are plotted in Robeson diagrams. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
at the atomistic level has been performed to understand the structural
orientations of polymers and their effect on the gas-transport properties
of penetrant gas molecules in polymer matrices. The dynamic properties
of the microstructure like trajectories of gas molecules and the diffusion
behavior of the penetrant molecules are also investigated.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
Several
new PIs with
phosphaphenanthrene skeleton (PI A, PI B, PI C, and PI D) were synthesized
by reacting 1,1-bis[2′-trifluoromethyl-4′-(4″-aminophenyl)phenoxy]-1-(6-oxido-6H-dibenz⟨c,e⟩⟨1,2⟩oxaphosphorin-6-yl)ethane
with four structurally different aromatic dianhydrides in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) by a two-step
procedure, e.g., ring-opening polyaddition of cyclic dianhydrides
with diamine to form poly(amic acid)s (PAAs), followed by thermal
cyclization, as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Scheme of Synthesis of PIs (A–D)
Experimentally determined C,
H, F, N, O, and P contents of the
PIs and values calculated from their repeat unit structures were in
good agreement. The 1H NMR spectra of the PIs confirmed
their repeat unit structures in terms of available magnetically different
protons and their relative intensities. The 1H NMR spectrum
of PI A in CDCl3 is shown in Figure 1 as a representative one. The 1H NMR spectra of the PIs did not show any peak corresponding to free
amine or amide protons, indicating the high conversion of the monomers
and complete imidization.30

Figure 1 Representative 1H NMR spectrum of PI A in CDCl3 (* corresponds to the
proton of CHCl3).

The FTIR spectra of the PIs showed characteristic absorption
bands
at ∼1780 cm–1 (asymmetric >C=O
stretching)
and ∼1690 cm–1 (symmetric >C=O
stretching),
indicating the formation of imide linkages. The absence of characteristic
stretching bands near 3200 cm–1 (−OH stretching)
and 3350 cm–1 (>N–H stretching) of the
PAAs
supported complete imidization. The bands near ∼1360 cm–1 (C–N symmetric stretching) and ∼820
cm–1 (C–N bending) also supported the successful
formation of imide linkages and high conversion of the monomers to
polymers. Other characteristic bands are ∼1620 cm–1 (aromatic >C=C< stretching), ∼1483 cm–1, ∼1366 cm–1 (asymmetric C–O–C
stretching), ∼1230 cm–1, ∼1130 cm–1 (C–F stretching), and ∼1060 cm–1 (C–O–C symmetric stretching).

The solubility of the PIs was investigated in different organic
solvents at a concentration of 10% (w/v) at room temperature. All
of the polymers (except PI D) were soluble in many common organic
solvents, such as dimethylacetamide, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP),
DMF, and dimethyl sulfoxide, as well as in many low-boiling solvents
like tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane, and CHCl3.
The presence of a bulky phosphaphenanthrene skeleton, pendant −CF3 group, and flexible spacer like ether linkage in the polymer
backbone inhibits close packing, leading to polymer chain–chain
interaction, which is attributed to their high free volume and improved
solubility.31 The PIs with additional ether
linkages (PI B and PI C) or hexafluoroisopropylidene linkage (PI A)
in the dianhydride part exhibited improved solubility. However, the
3,3′,4,4′-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA)-based
polymer (PI D) was insoluble in such organic solvents and in agreement
with the previous reports. The insolubility of the BPDA-based polyimides
was attributed to the formation of network structure through the reaction
of the carbonyl group in 4,4′-(4,4′-isopropylidenediphenoxy)bis(phthalic
anhydride) (BPADA) with the amine groups during high-temperature thermal
imidization.32,33

The physical properties
of the polymers are summarized in Table 1. The inherent viscosities
(ηinh) of the PIs are in the range of 0.97–1.15
dL/g in NMP, indicating the formation of high molar mass polymers.
The number-average molecular weight of the polymers is more than 55 000
g/mol, and the values are in accordance with the viscosity values.
The polydispersity index values were also in the ranges as usually
obtained in traditional step-growth polymerization.30 The density values of the polymer films were in the range
of 1.11–1.22 g/cm3. The bulky phosphaphenanthrene
moiety is free of conformational stress and prevents packing of polymer
chains and leads to decrease of the density of the polymer films and
thereby increase of free volume.29 Additionally,
large hexafluoroisopropylidene groups further inhibit close chain
packing (thereby inhibiting the rotational mobility of the polymer
chain) and therefore the 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic
anhydride (6FDA)-based polymers (PI A) have the highest FFV within
this series of polyimides.34 However, the
obtained experimental FFV values (especially for PI A and PI B) seem
to be unusually high, similar to those reported for high free volume,
highly permeable polymers like PTMSP and AF2400.35 Determining the reasons for this requires further corroboration
and elucidation.

The interchain
packing of the polymer membranes was investigated
by out-of-plane wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements.
The broad X-ray diffractogram of the PIs (Figure 2) indicated their amorphous nature. The amorphous
nature of the PIs is due to the presence of an unsymmetrical phosphaphenanthrene
skeleton, bulky trifluoromethyl groups in the diamine structure. All
of these structural units disturbed regularity and hindered close
packing of polymer chain. On the WAXD pattern, the position and shape
of the amorphous halo were dependent on the type of dianhydrides used
during polymerization. Different diffraction patterns in WAXD provide
different free volume morphologies, which affects FFV and gas permeability
of the polymers.

Figure 2 WAXD patterns of the polyimide membranes.

Water absorption behavior is one of the important
parameters for
the polymers used in electronic packaging applications, as the absorbed
water affects their dielectric performance.36 The water absorption value for PIs ranges from 0.44 to 0.59% (Table 1). The polyimides
derived from 6FDA (PI A) showed the lowest water absorption (0.44%).
This was attributed to the higher fluorine content in PI A.19 The water uptake values of these PIs were less
than those of Ultem 1000 (1.52%) and Kapton (3%).37,38

Polyimides are typically used in interlayer dielectrics as
gap
fill materials.19 Therefore, it is always
an interest to know the dielectric constant values of newly prepared
polyimides. Accordingly, the dielectric constants (ε) of these
polymer membranes were measured using a dielectric meter at 1 MHz
frequency, 30 °C, and relative humidity of 45%. The polymer films
showed considerably low dielectric constant values between 2.10 and
2.55 (Table 1). It
is attributed that the bulky phosphaphenanthrene moiety and pendent
−CF3 groups prevent close packing of the polymer
chains, which increases the fractional free volume and decreases the
number of polarizable units per unit volume. Another important factor
is that the electronic polarizability of C–F bond is lower
than that of C–H bond (bond polarizability, C–F = 0.56
and C–H = 0.65 units). This also contributes to the reduction
of ε values related to the fluorine content in the polymers.
Therefore, PI A having the highest fluorine content showed the lowest
ε value (ε = 2.10) in the series. It should also be noted
that the dielectric constant values of these polymers were considerably
lower than those of many other nonfluorinated polyimides, e.g., Kapton
H (ε = 3.5 at 1 kHz), Upilex R (ε = 3.5 at 1 kHz), Upilex
S (ε = 3.5 at 1 kHz), and Ultem 1000 (ε = 3.15 at 1 kHz),
and comparable to those of many semifluorinated poly(ether imide)s,
e.g., 6FDA–m-phenylene diamine (MPD, ε
= 3.0); 6FDA–7FMDA (ε = 2.9); and 6FDA–13FMDA
(ε = 2.7).37−39

Thermal Properties
The thermal degradation
of the polymers
is a very important parameter for membrane-based application.40 Thermal performance of the polymers was assessed
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under synthetic air. The TGA images
of the polymers are displayed in Figure 3. The PIs revealed a two-step thermal decomposition
with 10% weight loss (Td10) ranging from
390 to 416 °C in synthetic air (Table 2). The first stage of decomposition ranges
from 370 to 440 °C; this is due to the decomposition of P–O
bond. The second decomposition stage occurring from 490 to 560 °C
is accredited to the decomposition of aromatic polymer chain. The
P–C bond is weakest in DOPO, and the O=P–O group
was more thermally stable due to the protection of phenylene groups.
In DOPO moiety, electron-withdrawing P=O group destabilizes
the P–C bond by reducing the electron density of the carbon
and an electron-donating methyl group increases the electron density
of the carbon. However, the increment of the electron density of aliphatic
carbon adjacent to the phosphorous is more compared to the electron-withdrawing
P=O group.29 Therefore, the thermal
stability of P–C linkages in DOPO-containing PIs is high. All
of these PIs showed residues at 800 °C in the range of 3–4%
(considering P2O5 as the final product).

In this series, PI A showed the highest Td10 compared to other members in this series; this is
due to
the presence of hexafluoroisopropylidene (6F) moiety in the polymer
structure, which has a rigid structure and higher degree of aromaticity
that contribute to higher thermal stability. Comparatively lower Td10 values of PI B and PI C are attributed to
the presence of oxidizable isopropylidene linkages and the more number
of flexible ether linkages in their anhydride moiety.19

The glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of the PIs were determined by differential scanning
calorimetry
(DSC) under nitrogen atmosphere. The polymers showed glass-transition
temperatures without any melting or crystallization transition, indicating
their amorphous or glassy morphology. The glass-transition temperature
values of the PIs are given in Table 2, and the DSC curves are shown in Figure 4. The Tg values of the PIs ranged from 235 to 261 °C and followed
the order: PI A > PI D > PI C > PI B. Glass-transition temperatures
of polymers depend on different factors such as polymer intermolecular
force, symmetry, and rigidity of the polymer backbone. It is well
known that the glass-transition temperature increases with increasing
rigidity. PI A, i.e., 6FDA-based polymers, showed the highest Tg (261 °C) in this series, which is attributed
to the presence of bulky hexafluoroisopropylidene (6F) linkage that
hampers the backbone agility and increases rigidity.38 The presence of additional flexible ether linkage in their
anhydride part leads to lowering of Tg of PI B and PI C compared to BTDA-based polymer (PI D). The Tg values of these polymers are higher than those
in many commercial poly(ether imide)s, e.g., Ultem 1000 (Tg = 217 °C), based on BPADA and m-phenylene diamine (MPD).37 The bulky
pendant groups in the main chain hinder the rotation of chains, and
as a result, the Tg value increases.

Mechanical Property
Mechanical stability of the polymers
is an important parameter for their membrane-based gas-separation
applications.2,41 For gas-separation applications,
it is important to design the polymer as a tough and flexible membrane
with certain qualities like high mechanical strength and good thermal
stability. The mechanical properties of all of the PIs films are shown
in Table 2, an average
value of three repeated measurements is taken, and their corresponding
stress–strain curve is shown in Figure 5. The PIs showed high tensile strength up
to 91 MPa, elongation at break up to 18%, and Young’s modulus
up to 1.91 GPa. PIs derived from BPADA (PI B) and 4,4′-oxydiphthalic
anhydride (ODPA) (PI C) showed higher elongation of break (18 and
13%, respectively) in comparison to another member of the series,
which is attributed to the higher number of flexible ether linkage
in their structure. Low elongation at break of PI A and PI D was due
to highly rigid 6FDA and BTDA moieties.

Gas-Transport Properties
The main objective of our
current research is to obtain PI membranes with simultaneously high
permeability for gases and more selectivity for one gas over another.
The mean gas permeability of four different gases (CO2,
O2, N2, and CH4) and their ideal
selectivity values for different gas pairs are measured at 3.5 bar
and 35 °C. The values are summarized in Table 3. The diffusion coefficients and solubility
coefficient values along with their solubility selectivity and diffusivity
selectivity values are also tabulated in Table 4.

All of the PIs showed
high gas permeability and high permselectivity
depending on their structure. The gas permeabilities of polymers are
influenced by available FFV, flexibility of the polymer chains, kinetic
diameter of the permeate molecules, and polymer–penetrant interactions.42,43 The presence of bulky phosphaphenanthrene moiety in the main chain
restricts rotational mobility and hinders close chain packing, which
leads to higher FFV. Again, −CF3 groups in the polymer
chain make the polymer more bulky and effectively decreases interchain
packing. As a result, FFV increases, which leads to the increase of
permeability values. However, high permselectivity is attributed to
the rigidity of the chain coming from phosphaphenanthrene skeleton
and −CF3 groups.44,45

The
order of permeability coefficient of all of the gases through
these PI membranes follows the trend P (CO2) > P (O2) > P (N2) > P (CH4), and it
is exactly
opposite to the kinetic diameter of the gas molecules, CO2 (3.3 Å) < O2 (3.46 Å) < N2 (3.64 Å) < CH4 (3.8 Å).46 The order of gas permeability coefficient with PIs followed
the order: PI A > PI B > PI C > PI D, which is in concurrence
with
their FFV (Table 1).
PI A has the highest gas permeability in this series. This is due
to the presence of >C(CF3)2 moiety in the
dianhydride
part, which makes the polymer chain more rigid and hinders close chain
packing, as a result of which openness and FFV increase. PI B showed
higher permeability than PI C and PI D. The higher gas permeability
of BPADA-based polymer (PI B) is due to the presence of higher number
of flexible ether linkages47 and the presence
of bulky >C(CH3)2 groups. PI C exhibited
higher
gas permeability than PI D, which is due to the additional carbonyl
linkage present in PI D, which leads to comparatively close packing
of polymers. Therefore, the gas permeability through the polymer chain
is greatly influenced by the type of dianhydrides used in making the
polymers.

It is well established that for a pair of gas, selectivity
decreases
with increasing permeability.63−62 But, the permselectivity for CO2/CH4 and O2/N2 gas pairs followed the order: PI A > PI
B >
PI D > PI C. 6FDA-based polymer (PI A) exhibited very high permeability
along with higher selectivity. Higher permselectivity of PI A is due
to the presence of >C(CF3)2 groups, which
restricted
local segmental mobility and hindered torsional motion of the phenyl
rings around >C(CF3)2 linkage.28 It is well known that increase of Tg leads to increase of rigidity or stiffness of the polymer
chain and is expected to result in higher selectivity.

The permeability
coefficient values of the polyimides for different
gases have been correlated with their FFV. The relation between gas
permeability and FFV can be described by eq 1 1  where A is a preexponential
factor and B is typical of the size of each gas.
The logarithm of gas permeability values is plotted against the reciprocal
of FFV in Figure 6.
The gas permeability of the polymers increases with their FFV values,
and almost a linear relationship was noted except for CO2.42

Figure 6 Dependence of gas permeability on the
reciprocal of fractional
free volume of PIs for CO2, O2, N2, and CH4 gases.

The gas permeability (P) of polymeric membranes
is controlled by gas diffusivity and solubility (P = D × S), and the gas diffusivity
and solubility are governed by polymer–penetrant dynamics and
polymer–penetrant interactions, respectively.29 Therefore, for a better understanding, both the gas diffusivity
and solubility coefficients of the PI membranes are determined and
the values are presented in Table 4. The gas permeability of the polymers is mainly contributed
by their diffusivity coefficient values, rather than the solubility
coefficient values of these polymers, particularly for the noncondensable
gases. The PIs showed the trend of gas diffusivity as: D(O2) > D(CO2) > D(N2) > D(CH4),
which is not
the same as their permeability coefficient values. From the kinetic
diameter data, it is expected that CO2 will diffuse faster
compared to O2. However, a reverse trend is found and is
consistent with many of the earlier observations.48 This observation can be explained as follows: there is
negligible or no interaction of O2, N2, and
CH4 with these PIs, but CO2 has some interaction
with the carbonyl or imide groups in the polyimide repeat unit.49,50 The order of diffusivity coefficients of the PIs followed the same
trend as gas permeability coefficients for different PIs, i.e., PI
A > PI B > PI C > PI D. The decreasing order of diffusivity
coefficient
and permeability coefficient corresponds to the decreasing order of
FFV values for these PIs. Taking into account the solubility coefficient
of the PIs, CO2 has a higher solubility coefficient than
other gases. In comparison to other gases, CO2 has high
permeability due to its high solubility coefficient values.51 The overall permselectivity is a product of
diffusivity selectivity (αD) and solubility selectivity
(αS). Permselectivity values of the polyimides for
the gas pair CO2/CH4 were predominant by the
solubility selectivity as the diffusion selectivity values were relatively
low (Table 4). For
noninteracting gas molecules like O2, N2, and
CH4, permselectivity values are derived from the equal
contributions of solubility and diffusivity. For highly soluble and
condensable gases such as CO2, selectivity is due to solubility
selectivity. The solubility coefficients of the PI membranes that
arise due to the polymer–penetrant interactions followed the
order: S (CO2) > S (O2) > S (N2) > S (CH4).

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
In recent years, with
rapidly growing computational resources, simulation has proven to
be a very useful tool for better theoretical understanding of the
relationship between the chemical structure and transport behavior
of amorphous polymer membranes as it plays a vital role in membrane
science and technology.52 Molecular dynamics
simulation was performed on PI membranes to provide deeper insight
into structural orientation of polymer chains and their effect on
gas-transport properties.53 The FFV of
the PIs was determined by both atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
(FFVSIM) and experiments (FFV). The FFVSIM is
in the range of 0.264–0.372. It can be observed (Table 1) that the FFVSIM value is comparatively higher than FFV, but they follow the same
trend PI A > PI B > PI C > PI D. A similar type of observation
was
also observed by Maya et al.54 MD simulations
provide a better idea of the three-dimensional arrangement, connectivity,
and size distribution of free volume elements (FVD) that are not reachable
in experiments. Therefore, MD simulations indicated the true free
volume of the system. The gas permeability, diffusivity, and permselectivity
of polymer membranes are greatly influenced by FVD and the size of
free volume elements.48,55

The size distributions
of the free volume elements in all of the polymers are given in Figure 7. The FVDs for the
PIs helped us to understand the effect of FFV on gas diffusivities
in this series of polymers. It is already established that the free
volume distributions in amorphous polymers are an important aspect
of their transport behavior toward small and medium-sized penetrant
molecules.55 The figure shows the monomodal
size distribution with maximum opportunity at free volume element
radii of approximately 0–20 Å3, which indicates
the total extension of an interconnected free volume region.52 The higher size of free volume distribution
is due to the presence of a bulky phosphaphenanthrene moiety, rigid
−CF3 groups, and orientations of polymer chains.
Apparently, the spreading appears almost comparable for all of the
PI membranes, but in the large-volume radii region, there is a significant
difference, that is, the number of voids with volume larger than 40
Å3, highest for PI A and lowest for PI D. PI C and
PI D have almost the same distribution after 60 Å3. The number of voids with a volume larger than the kinetic diameter
of gas molecules has a substantial influence on diffusivity. These
plots give an idea of the diffusivity of various gases through these
membranes and the accessibility of free volume pockets within the
membrane depending on the local arrangement of the polymer chains.

Figure 7 Size distribution
of free volume of the PIs.

The free volume morphologies of the PI membranes (Figure 8) were analyzed using
the free
volume size, shape, and connectivity.52 The gray area in the figure indicates the void spaces in the membrane
matrix. In comparison to its amide analogue,29 the void space is much elongated and connected here. From this observation,
it can be concluded that not only bulky phosphaphenanthrene group
is accountable for large elongated microcavities in the matrix, but
also the structure of the dianhydride part played a vital role. The
number and connectivity of void space decrease from PI A to PI D.
PI C and PI D have lower void space in comparison to other two polymers,
indicating a tight packing of their polymer chain. We can quantitatively
correlate free volume morphology with gas permeability of polymer
membranes. PI A has the highest void space and well-connected network,
and also experimentally, PI A exhibited the highest gas permeability.

Figure 8 Free volume
morphologies of the polymer membrane matrix estimated
for a probe radius of 0.5 Å.

The diffusivity order of the four gases through the PI membranes
was also determined by molecular dynamic simulations (Figure 9), and it is observed that
the experimental value and simulation result follow the same trends
to close proximity. This close proximity between the experimental
and simulated values signifies the success of our MD simulation for
predicting the polymer properties.6 The
trend of diffusion coefficients calculated by MD simulations and experiments
was same [D(O2) > D(CO2) > D(N2) > D(CH4)]. Similar to the experimental results,
O2 diffuses faster than CO2, although CO2 has
smaller size than O2. This is attributed to the linear
shape of CO2 molecule, which strongly interacts with the
PI membranes and takes comparatively much more time to enter the void
space.56 From Figure 9, it can be seen that PI A has a higher diffusion
coefficient in comparison to other PIs in this series. In comparison
to the other polymers in the series, the PI A has looser structure
and larger FFV, so it provides a pathway with less resistance to diffuse
the gas. Therefore, the gas diffusivity is influenced by the size,
distribution, and connectivity of the free volume cavities in the
membranes and also depends on the shape and interactions of the gas
molecules within the matrix.57

Figure 9 Diffusivity
order of the four gases through the PI membranes determined
by molecular dynamic simulation.

The fractional accessible volume (FAV) was analyzed using
spherical
probes with different radii to understand changes in the available
free volume with respect to the size of the penetrant molecules. Figure 10 shows the available
volume as a function of the probe radius. From this figure, it can
be observed that the fractional accessible volume is significantly
higher in the case of PI A compared to other polymers in the series,
which is in good agreement with their FVD (Figure 7). From this figure, it is evident that FAV
decreases as probe radius increases and that FFV approaches 0 when
the probe radius is larger than approximately 2 Å. The fractional
free volume at a probe radius of 0 for all of the polymers ranges
from 0.27 to 0.37. This gives the idea that diffusivity of different
gases through the polymer membrane is notably different and depends
on the effective size of each penetrant molecule. Thus, for larger
penetrant molecules like N2 or CH4, gas diffusivity
is low in comparison to smaller penetrant molecules such as O2 and CO2. The FAV order follows the same order
as FFV PI A > PI B > PI C > PI D. So, the large accessible
volume
in the polymer matrix increases gas diffusivity as well as improves
gas permeability.

Figure 10 Fractional accessible volume (FAV) of the different gas
molecules
for these series of PIs.

To understand the diffusion behavior of the gases through
the polymer
membrane, the trajectories of gas molecules were further analyzed.
The representative trajectories of all of the gas molecules in the
simulation box are shown in Figure 11. According to Neyertz et al. the mechanism of transport
of gas molecules in the polymer matrix is based on a combination of
random oscillations within the available polymer free volumes and
occasional jumping events from one void space to another.58 The largest free volume cavities and a good
connectivity between them lead to the highest length of the trajectory
for a particular gas molecule in the PI A membrane. The total distance
traversed by the gas molecules in the polymer microstructure followed
the order (O2) > (CO2) > (N2) > (CH4). The order is in good agreement with the
gas diffusivity
value. From Figure 11, it is evident that O2 moves a larger distance in comparison
to others (shown by the red line).

10 ns at T = 30 °C. (O2 = red, CO2 = green, N2 = brown, CH4 = blue.)

Comparison of Gas Permeabilities
with Previously Reported Polymers
The ideal gas-separation
performances of these polymeric membranes
have been compared to those of some commercially available polymer
membranes (e.g., Matrimid, Ultem, and Extem)59−61 and previously
reported polymers.29,63−65 To better realize
the gas-separation performance of the PI membranes, their gas permeability
and permselectivity values for a pair of gases were plotted in Robeson
diagrams along with many other polymers. It can be seen from Figures 12 and 13 that these polymers showed reasonably high permeability
with better separation performances for both O2/N2 and CO2/CH4 gas pairs compared to Matrimid,
Ultem, and Extem. Especially, PI A showed higher permeability as well
as higher permselectivity. For O2/N2 gas pairs,
all of the synthesized polymers are very close (PI A surpassed) to
the upper boundary limit drawn by Robeson.12

Conclusions
Polyimides
are an important class of high-performance polymers
because of their excellent thermal and mechanical stabilities and
film-forming ability. The introduction of flexible segments like ether
linkage and trifluoromethyl (−CF3) or hexafluoroisopropylidene
[>C(CF3)2] groups hinders close packing of
the
polyimide chains, increases the fractional free volume, and thereby
improves the polymer processability and gas permeability.19 In the present work, a series of polyimide with
phosphaphenanthrene unit in the main chain were prepared and characterized
in detail. The best combination of thermal and mechanical properties
and good film-forming ability made these polymers suitable candidates
for membrane-based gas-separation applications. The motivation behind
the incorporation of a bulky phosphaphenanthrene unit in the main
chain was further to reduce the polymer chain packing, which increases
the FFV and simultaneously increases the chain rigidity, thereby manipulating
the gas permeability and permselectivity. The polymers showed different
fractional free volumes and chain packing depending on the dianhydride
structures, and such carefully designed polymers showed improvement
in both gas permeability and permselectivity compared to Matrimid
or Ultem (which have high selectivity but low permeability). One of
the polymers designated as PI A (6FDA-based polymer) showed very good
separation efficiency in the series with PCO2 and PO2 of 175
and 64 barrer, respectively, and reasonably high permselectivity (PCO2/PCH4 = 51 and PO2/PN2 = 7.1). All of the polymers
showed very high selectivity for O2/N2 and placed
themselves very close to Robeson upper bound drawn in 2008, and PI
A surpassed the upper boundary limit. Gas diffusivity through these
PI membranes was in accordance with the FVD obtained from the computational
simulation. The MD study indicated that the overall free volume, free
volume distribution, and morphological nature of the polymers play
a role in gas permeation. Finally, it can be concluded that using
phosphaphenanthrene unit is a good approach to develop PI membranes
with a combination of good permeability and selectivity, which is
suitable for gas permeation applications.

were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, recrystallized from acetic anhydride,
and kept in 150 °C for 12 h before use. 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane
(purity ∼ 98%, density ∼ 0.692 g/cc) was purchased from

The monomer 1,1-bis[2′-trifluoromethyl-4′-(4″-aminophenyl)phenoxy]-1-(6-oxido-6H-dibenz⟨c,e⟩⟨1,2⟩oxaphosphorin-6-yl)ethane
was synthesized according to procedure reported in the literature.29

Synthesis of the Polymers and Membrane Preparation
The PIs were prepared by reacting the diamine monomer 1-bis[2′-trifluoromethyl-4′-(4″-aminophenyl)phenoxy]-1-(6-oxido-6H-dibenz⟨c,e⟩⟨1,2⟩oxaphosphorin-6-yl)ethane
with four different aromatic dianhydrides in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (10%, w/v) (Scheme 1). Equimolar amounts of diamine and dianhydride
monomers were reacted to get the corresponding poly(amic acid)s (PAA)s,
and the corresponding PI membranes were obtained by thermal imidization.
The polymerization and preparation of PI A membrane is given below
as one of the representatives.

A 25 mL round-bottom flask equipped
with a CaCl2 guard tube and a magnetic stirrer was charged
with diamine monomer (0.382 g, 0.425 mmol), 6FDA (0.189 g, 0.425 mmol),
and 5 mL dry DMF. The resulting mixture was converted to a viscous
PAA solution in 15–20 min and kept under stirring for 1 h.
PI membranes were prepared by thermal imidization of the PAA. The
viscous PAA solution was cast on a clean, dry, and flat-bottom Petri
dish and left overnight at 80 °C for slow evaporation of the
maximum amount of solvent. The final cyclization from PAA to PI was
achieved by successive heating in 100, 120, 150, 180, 200, and 220
°C for 1 h at each temperature and at 250 °C for 30 min
under vacuum. Then, the oven temperature was set at 150 °C and
the membranes were kept overnight under vacuum for complete removal
of the solvent. Finally, the oven temperature was slowly brought down
to room temperature and the membranes were removed from the Petri
dishes by putting them in boiling water.

The PI membranes were
transparent and flexible with an average
thickness of 70 μm. All of the PI membranes were prepared following
the same procedure. Analytical details of the PIs are given below.

Measurements
and Characterizations
1H NMR
spectra of the polymers were recorded in a 600 MHz NMR instrument
(Bruker, Switzerland) [reference 0 ppm with tetramethylsilane (1H NMR)], and CDCl3 was used as solvent. FTIR spectra
of the polymers (membranes) were recorded with NEXUS Nicolet Impact-410
spectrophotometer at room temperature. Gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) was performed with a Waters GPC instrument (Waters 2414). THF
was used as an eluent (flow rate, 0.5 mL/min), polystyrene was used
as a standard, and an RI detector was used to record the signal. Viscosity
measurements (ηinh) were performed with a Ubbelohde
suspended level viscometer at 30 °C using DMF as a solvent, and
the concentration of the solution was 0.5 g/dL. The wide-angle X-ray
diffraction (WAXD) patterns of the polymer membranes were performed
in reflection mode over the 2θ range of 5–40° at
room temperature using a Ultima III X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku,
Japan) at an operating voltage and current of 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively,
with Cu Kα (0.154 nm) radiation source. Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a TA Instruments
DSC Q20, with 7 ± 1 mg samples at a heating or cooling rate of
20 °C/min under N2 atmosphere. Glass-transition temperature
(Tg) was taken as the midpoint of the
step transition of the second heating run. The thermal decomposition
of polymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis using TGA
Q50 from TA Instruments. The heating rate of the thermo-balance was
10 °C/min, and the study was performed under synthetic air (80%
N2 and 20% O2). The decomposition temperature Td10 values were taken as 10% weight loss temperature
of the polymers. The stress–strain properties, such as modulus,
tensile strength, and elongation at break, of the PI membranes were
tested by using TINIUS OLSEN H5KS universal testing machine at a cross-head
speed of 5 mm/min. Polymer films of average thickness 70 μm,
width 10 mm, and effective length 25 mm (distance between the clamps)
were used for the measurements. For each polymer, the stress–strain
measurements were performed with three uniform specimens and the average
values are reported. The standard deviation of the measurements was
below 4% of the mean value. Water absorption studies of the vacuum-dried
membranes were checked by dipping the membranes in distilled water
for 72 h at 30 °C. Sartorius micro balance of sensitivity 10–6 g was used to measure the weight gains, and water
absorption values were calculated using the formula: % water absorbed
= [(weight of the wet film – weight of the dry film)/weight
of the dry film] × 100. The dielectric constants (ε) were
determined by measuring the capacitance of the PI membranes (parallel-plate
capacitor method) using a YHP 4278 capacitance meter at 1 MHz at 30
°C at a relative humidity of 45. The density of the films was
measured using a Wallace High Precision Densimeter-X22B (U.K.) (2,2,4-trimethylpentane
displacement) at 30 °C by Archimedes’ principle according
to eq 2. 2  where ρ,
ρI, W0, and WI are the
density of the polymer film, density of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (∼0.692
g/cc), weight of polymer film in air, and weight of polymer film in
2,2,4-trimethylpentane, respectively.

The fractional free volumes
(FFVs) of the polymers were calculated using eq 3. 3  where V is the specific
volume
(V = 1/ρ), which is determined from the measured
density (ρ) values of the polymer films, and Vw is the specific van der Waals volume, which is obtained
using the computer program HyperChem, version 8.0.66 HyperChem computer program has developed based on the work
of Bodor et al.67 and Gavezzotti.68 The same program has been successfully used
by many researchers69 where the calculation
of Vw values is not possible by standard
group contribution methods.

Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations
Atomistic molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using the LAMMPS molecular
simulation package.29,48 The detailed procedure is discussed
in the Supporting Information.

Gas Permeation
The gas-transport properties of CO2, O2,
N2, and CH4 through
PI membranes (average thickness, 70 μm) were measured by using
a permeation test system, PTS 50F-16 M, manufactured by Indian High
Vacuum Pumps, India, at an applied gas pressure of 3.5 bar and 35
°C. The membranes were degassed for 24 h after placing them in
a permeation cell using a turbomolecular pump, and XL grade gases
from Linde India were used for permeation studies. The permeability
coefficients were calculated from eq 4 and expressed in barrer. 4  where P, V, d, and A are expressed
as pure
gas permeability in barrer (1 barrer = 10–10 cm3 (STP) cm/cm2 s cmHg), downstream volume (119 cm3), thickness of the membranes (0.007 cm), and actual membrane
area (12.25 cm2), respectively; T0 and p0 are the standard temperature
(T0 = 273.15 K) and pressure (p0 = 1.013 bar), respectively; T and pi are the upstream gas pressure (cmHg) and the measurement
temperature (K), respectively; and (dp/dt)s is the rate of pressure rise in the downstream chamber
in the steady state. For each measurement, replicas of four specimens
were used and the error of the measurements was ±5% (within 1–3%
for CO2 and O2 and 2–5% for N2 and CH4), and the gas permeability values are reported
as the average of these four independent experiments. The representative
plots for the 6FDA-based polyimide (PA I) are provided in the Supporting
Information (Figures S1–S5). The
diffusion coefficient (D) was calculated from the
time-lag “θ” value using eq 5. 5  The solubility coefficient
(S) was obtained indirectly using eq 6. 6  The ideal permselectivity (αA/B) was calculated
from the ratio of the individual single gas permeabilities
using eq 7. 7
