A series of multinuclear
heterometallic Cu–Zn complexes
of molecular formula [(CuL)2Zn(dca)2] (1), [(CuL)2Zn(NO3)2] (2), [(CuL)2Zn2(Cl)4] (3), and [(CuL)2Zn2(NO2)4] (4) have been synthesized by reacting [CuL]
as a “metalloligand (ML)” (where HL = N,N′-bis(5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzylidene)-2,2-dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine)
and by varying the anions or coligands using the same molar ratios
of the reactants. All of the four products including the ML have been
characterized by infrared and UV–vis spectroscopies and elemental
and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. By varying the anions,
different structures and topologies are obtained which we have tried
to rationalize by means of thorough density functional theory calculations.
All of the complexes (1–4) have now been applied
for several biological investigations to verify their therapeutic
worth. First, their cytotoxicity properties were assessed against
HeLa human cervical carcinoma along with the determination of IC50 values. The study was extended with extensive DNA and protein
binding experiments followed by detailed fluorescence quenching study
with suitable reagents to comprehend the mechanistic pathway. From
all of these biological studies, it has been found that all of these
heterometallic complexes show more than a few fold improvement of
their therapeutic values as compared to the similar homometallic ones
probably because of the simultaneous synergic effect of copper and
zinc. Among all of the four heterometallic complexes, complex 3 exhibits highest binding constants and IC50 values
suggest for their better interaction toward the biological targets
and hence have better clinical importance.

Introduction
Metal complexes can
be classified as simple organic ligand-bound
metal centers forming a precise three-dimensional arrangement. Therefore,
synthesis of these transition-metal complexes can be easily done in
just fewer steps with greater flexibility, attained by slight modification
in each steps. Now, the specially designed metal complexes bearing
suitable donor atoms can further be conveniently used as a “complex
as a ligand”1−3 for the synthesis of multinuclear heterometallic
complexes, one of the most attracted frameworks to structural chemists
since the last two decades. The ongoing interest on heterometallic
transition-metal complexes is principally owing to their miscellaneous
applications ranging from catalytic activity,4 magnetic devices,5,6 and liquid crystalline materials7 to sensor design8 and
finally, most importantly as therapeutic drugs.9,10 The
common research in heterometallic chemistry majorly concentrates over
molecular magnetism nurturing the strategy of single-molecule magnets
leaving the biomedical application a less explored corner, although
it may open up a new avenue in drug development. Thus, in the present
perspective, we have therefore been motivated to develop heterometallic
complexes having a potential therapeutic function. Although in the
recent progress of medicinal research, huge applications have already
been done using a variety of homometallic complexes as metal-based
therapeutic agents,11−15 leaving the heterometallic systems an untouched arena. To design
the therapeutically active heterometallic complex, the goal in our
mind was that the inclusion of two unlike cytotoxic metals in the
same molecule would progress their biomedical activity as the interaction
of two different metals with multiple biological targets may improve
their physicochemical properties with respect to the homometallic
one. Therefore, in this context, we have chosen to design heteronuclear
complexes particularly comprising copper and zinc within the same
ligand framework mainly because of this three principal reasons: (i)
due to their mimicking ability like active site center in copper zinc
superoxide dismutase.16,17 (ii) Many copper-containing complexes
have possible medicinal value in curing various diseases including
cancer.18,19 (iii) Zinc-containing complexes can exhibit
awfully good activity toward the phosphate bond cleavage as it is
in the active site center of phosphatase, which may therefore be utilized
as a DNA-cleavage agent.20,21 Therefore, it has thought
that their combination may advance their therapeutic value based on
these abilities. In order to reach our goal, the ligand of our choice
in the present study is 2,2′-((1E,1′E)-((2,2-dimethylpropane-1,3-diyl)bis(azanylylidene))bis(methanylylidene))bis(4-chlorophenol),
a tetradentate N,N,O,O donor ligand, and first reacting it with copper(II)
perchlorate, we obtained the mononuclear copper complex which is further
used as the metalloligand (ML) to obtain the multinuclear heterometallic
complexes in the presence of zinc salts by varying the anions. The
four new heterometallic complexes (1, 2, 3, and 4) so achieved illustrate anion-dependent
structural variation which has been methodically characterized by
X-ray diffraction studies, followed by thorough rationalization in
terms of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, the
heterometallic complexes have been applied to investigate their mode
of action toward various biological processes to see their clinical
importance. The detection abilities here include the first cytotoxicity
study using HeLa cancer cells22 with the
determination of IC50 values, suggesting that the compounds
present a higher cytotoxic activity because of the synergic effect
of both metal ions Cu and Zn than the similar homometallic complexes.
Next, we have done the DNA-binding experiments with fish sperm DNA
(FS-DNA), where complex 3 gives the highest binding constants;
this study was further extended by fluorescence quenching with methylene
blue (MB) to get more insight on the intercalative mechanism. Finally,
protein binding studies have been executed to evaluate the complexes’
transporting ability as a drug using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as
a carrier protein. The protein interaction was assessed by the tryptophan
quenching study, and the corresponding binding constant and numbers
of binding sites have been determined using complex 3 as the model. In particular, all of these synthesis, characterization,
theoretical rationalization, and biological studies have been well
documented in this paper.

Computational and Biological Details
Theoretical
Methods
BP86/def2TZVP has been applied
to perform the calculations using the program TURBOMOLE version 7.0.23 For reproducing the solvent effects, the conductor-like
screening model COSMO, a variant of the dielectric continuum solvation
models,24 has been employed.

Cytotoxicity
Tests
Preparation of Solutions of Drugs
A stock solution
of the compounds at a concentration of 2 mM was prepared in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), subsequently; the solution was diluted with water
to various working concentrations. It is important to note that in
no case, the quantity of DMSO in the solution was exceeding 0.5% to
assure this is nontoxic to treated cells. DMSO was used because of
the solubility problems. The nutrient medium was the Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium, with phenol red, supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mM), streptomycin (100 μg/mL), and penicillin
(100 U/mL), and 10% fetal bovine serum. A Sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)-benzenesulfonic
acid hydrate (XTT) cell proliferation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals,
Mannheim, Germany) was prepared according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. All reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemicals. For
the normal cells, the CellTiter-Glo 2.0 luminescent cell viability
assay (Promega) was prepared according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Cell Culture
Human cervix adenocarcinoma
HeLa cells
were cultured as monolayers in the nutrient medium. The cells were
grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and humidified air atmosphere
and were subsequently seeded (1500 cells per well) into 96-well microtiter
plates, and 24 h later, after the cell adherence, different concentrations
(10–5 to 10–9 M) of investigated
compounds were added to the wells. Only the nutrient medium and DMSO
were added to the cells in the control wells. Human bone marrow stroma
cells [HS-5 (ATCC CRL-11882)] and human lung fibroblasts [MRC-5 (ATCC
CCL-171)] were cultured as monolayers in the nutrient medium. The
cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and humidified
air atmosphere and were subsequently seeded (1500 cells per well)
into 96-well microtiter plates, and 24 h later, after the cell adherence,
different concentrations (10–5 to 10–9 M) of investigated compounds were added to the wells. Only the nutrient
medium and DMSO were added to the cells in the control wells. All
experiments were done in triplicate.

Determination of Target
Cell Survival
Seventy-two hours
after compound addition, cell survival was quantified using a XTT
cell proliferation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany),
following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. A mixture
solution of the labeling reagent XTT and the electron-coupling reagent N-methylphenaziniummethylsulfate was added to each well
(50 μL of each). The mixtures were incubated for 4 h in a humidified
atmosphere (37 °C, 5% CO2), and as a formazan product
is generated, the absorbance was measured with a microtiter plate
reader at 450 nm using a reference wavelength of 630 nm. The IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) was calculated as the drug
concentration causing a 50% inhibition of cell proliferation. For
the normal cells 72 h after compound addition, cell survival was quantified
using a CellTiter-Glo 2.0 luminescent cell viability assay (Promega),
following the instruction of the manufacturer. The reactive (50 μL)
was added to each well, and the plate was shaken for 10 s and incubated
at room temperature for 10 min. The luminescence was measured with
a VICTOR X3 multilabel plate reader, and as in the case of the HeLa
cells, the IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) was calculated
as the drug concentration causing a 50% inhibition of cell proliferation.

Binding Experiments
DNA-Binding
FS-DNA was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.
The spectroscopic titration of FS-DNA was carried out in a Tris-amine
buffer prepared at room temperature with the following composition
50 mM NaCl–5 mM Tris-HCl and which has a pH of 7.4. A solution
of FS-DNA in the buffer gave a ratio of UV absorbance 1.8–1.9:1
at 260 and 280 nm, indicating that the DNA was sufficiently free of
protein.25 Nanopure water was used to prepare
the solutions, and the DNA concentration per nucleotide was determined
by UV–visible spectroscopy using the known molar extinction
coefficient value of 6600 M–1 cm–1 at 260 nm.26 Titrations were followed
by absorption spectroscopy at 260 nm using fixed complex concentrations
and adding increments of the DNA stock solution. Complex–DNA
adduct solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before recording
the absorption spectra.

BSA Interaction Studies
BSA was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The interaction of the synthesized materials with BSA was measured
by absorption spectroscopy; the interaction studies were carried out
at room temperature using the buffer with a composition of 50 mM NaCl–5
mM Tris-HCl and a pH of 7.4. A solution of BSA in the buffer (using
nanopure water to prepare the solutions) was used, and all of the
spectroscopic studies were carried out between 200 and 500 nm by using
a fixed concentration of complex and adding different quantities of
BSA solution. The adducts formed by the metal complexes and BSA were
incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before recording the UV–visible
absorption spectra.

Tryptophan Quenching Experiment and Determination
of Binding
Constant and Number of Binding Sites
BSA fluorescence emission
spectra have been recorded in the presence of increasing concentrations
of the studied complex and in the absence of the studied complex to
determine the possible interaction between the studied Zn–Cu
complex and BSA. It is generally agreed that the BSA fluorescence
is coming from tryptophan (Trp), located on the surface of the domain,
Trp-213 located in the hydrophobic pocket of domain II, and phenyl
alanine (Phe) residues. In all cases, it is observed that BSA solutions
have the fluorescence emission at 345 nm upon excitation at 285 nm.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis, Rationalization, and Characterization
of the Metal
Complexes
Four structurally characterized heterometallic
complexes have been synthesized using the sequential procedure in
which the methanolic solution of the zinc salts as the second metal
is added to the methanolic solution of the ML [CuL] (Scheme 1). In some cases (complexes 1 and 4), bridging salts (dca– and NO2–) are added to the heterometallic
solution in order to obtain the coordination polymers.

Scheme 1 Formation
of Complexes 1–4
FT-IR and UV–Visible Spectra of the Complexes
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of all of
the four heterometallic complexes and the ML are presented in Figures S1–S5. The ML shows a C=N
stretching frequency at 1623 cm–1 and skeletal vibration
at 1533 cm–1. For the heterometallic complexes,
they all possess a band in the region of 1634–1647 cm–1 because of the azomethane (C=N) group and show skeletal vibration
around 1520 cm–1. Complex 1 displays
a sharp peak at 2150 cm–1 because of coordinated
dicyanamide anion, whereas complex 2 exhibits a peak
at 1379 cm–1, which is characteristic of nitrate.
Complex 3 is a halide-containing species which therefore
does not show any characteristic sharp peak for anions. Complex 4 is a nitrite-bridging species which hence displays a sharp
peak at 1414 cm–1 characteristic of nitrite.

The absorption spectra of the complexes have been performed in the
DMSO medium at room temperature and are shown in Figure S6. All of the complexes exhibit similar absorption
spectra with an intense band at around 375 nm very similar to that
of the ML, clearly indicating that here a ligand-to-metal charge transfer
occurs in the ML complexes which persists also in the presence of
the d10 metal ion zinc.

Crystal Structure Description
of the Complexes
Metalloligand
An ORTEP view of ML,
used as the “ML”
building unit for the synthesis of polynuclear complexes here described,
is reported in Figure 1. A selection of bond lengths and angles is reported in Table S1. In the complex, the CuII ion is coordinated in a slightly distorted square-planar environment
by the N and O atoms of the tetradentate ligand. The complex atoms
with the exception of the propyl chain are practically coplanar, and
the dihedral angle between the salicylaldimine moieties is of 7.22°.
The Cu–O and Cu–N bond distances are within the normal
ranges being of 1.905(2) and 1.903(2) Å and of 1.947(3) and 1.953(3)
Å, respectively. The crystal packing shows complexes piled along
axis a alternatively in the head–tail fashion
related to the center of symmetry. This arrangement allows the phenyl
rings to be faced showing π–π interactions (centroid-to-centroid
distances of 3.828(2) and 3.838(2) Å).

Figure 1 ORTEP drawing (ellipsoids
at 50% probability) of ML.

Complexes 1 and 2 are trinuclear
species
in which two CuL (ML) units bridge central Zn atom in a centrosymmetrical
fashion, where the copper and zinc ions exhibit a square pyramidal
and octahedral coordination geometry, respectively. A perspective
view of the polymeric unit of complex 1 and that of complex 2 are shown in Figures 2 and 4, respectively.

Figure 2 ORTEP drawing (ellipsoids
at 35% probability) of the centrosymmetric
unit of polymeric complex 1 (inset: coordination environment
around CuII and ZnII centers).

An ORTEP view of complex 1 is shown
in Figure 2. Here,
a pair of μ1,5-dicyanoamide anions bridges the zinc
and copper ions of
trinuclear units, thus forming a polymeric chain along crystallographic
axis c, as depicted in Figure 2. The dicyanoamide has been used in trinuclear
Cu–M–Cu similar complexes (M = Co, Ni, and Zn), obtaining
a 2D polymeric network instead.27 Complex 1 shows the basal Cu–N and Cu–O bond distances
following a trend similar to other complexes, whereas the apical Cu–N(dca)
is of 2.479(5) Å. The Zn–O bond lengths, with a mean value
of 2.180 Å, are ca. 0.1 longer than those measured in complex 2, but Zn–N(dca) is of 2.031(4) Å. Thus, the μ1,5-dca connector exhibits an asymmetric coordination, which
is more strongly bound to Zn. The intermetallic Cu–Zn distance
within the trinuclear entity is of 3.1891(8) Å, and the dca spaces
the metals along the chain at 8.9152(13) Å (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Polymeric structure of
complex 4 developed along crystallographic
axis c.

In the discrete complex 2, the metals are bridged
by two nitrate anion symmetry related to the center of inversion (Figure 4). Each anion is disordered over two positions at half occupancy
in order to avoid, for one of these steric clashes with a lattice
water molecule O1w (occupancy 0.5). In the square pyramidal coordination
geometry of copper, the basal Cu–O and Cu–N bond lengths
are comparable to those detected in other compounds reported here.
On the other hand, the apical position is occupied by disordered nitrate
oxygens O(3) and O(3b) at 2.356(11) and 2.323(12) Å, respectively
(Figure S7), considerably shorter than
the Cu–O(nitrite) value measured in 4 (of 2.593(3)
Å).

Figure 4 ORTEP drawing (ellipsoids at 35% probability) of centrosymmetric
trinuclear complex 2 of the disordered bridging nitrate
anion, only one fragment is shown (inset: coordination environment
around CuII and ZnII centers).

On the other hand, in the octahedral ZnO6 chromophore,
the Zn–O bond distances are in the range 2.045(3)–2.084(10)
Å, but the distance involving oxygen O(4b), of the second nitrate
fragment, is significantly longer (2.279(11) Å). The intermetallic
Cu–Zn distance is of 3.0178(6) Å.

Three such linear
Cu–Zn–Cu complexes containing bridging
nitrate,28 acetate,29 and azide30 with salicylidene-1,3-propanediaminate
have been reported, showing that a Cu–Zn distance is of 3.0017(6)
Å.

Different from what observed in the tetranuclear complexes
where
the phenol moieties of the ligand L are slightly tilted to each other
here is worth noting the umbrella shape arrangement assumed by the
symmetry related ligands L in order to allow the formation of the
trinuclear Cu–Zn–Cu derivatives. This conformation (Figure 5) is such that the
phenol rings form close comparable dihedral angles of 57.93°
and 59.98°, in complexes 1 and 2, respectively.

Figure 5 View along
the Cu–Cu′ direction in the trinuclear
complexes 2 and 1, showing the conformational
arrangement assumed by the two L ligands.

By using anions chloride or nitrite, we obtained tetranuclear
Cu2Zn2 complexes, [CuLZnCl2]2 (3) and [CuLZn(NO2)2]2 (4). Both are structurally related and can be
considered
as a dimmer of two diphenoxo-bridged dinuclear CuLZn moieties connected
by bridging Cl– or NO2– anions in a centrosymmetric fashion, crystallizing in the monoclinic
space group P21/c. An
ORTEP diagram of the two complexes is shown in Figures 6 and 7, and the bond
lengths and angles of the coordination sphere are listed in Tables S5 and S6,
respectively.

tetranuclear complex 3 (inset: coordination environment
around CuII and ZnII centers).

Figure 7 ORTEP drawing (ellipsoids at 40% probability) of centrosymmetric
tetranuclear complex 4 (inset: coordination environment
around CuII and ZnII centers).

In complex 3, which as-mentioned above
is closely
related to 4, the geometry around copper is still in
a distorted square pyramidal geometry with a τ parameter of
0.118. Here, the Cu–N and Cu–O bond lengths are of 1.975(3)
and 1.935(4) and 1.929(3) and 1.939(3) Å, respectively. The apical
position is occupied by chloride at considerably long distance Cu–Cl(4′),
2.8484(15) Å, that however does not exclude an interaction between
these atoms. On the other hand, the zinc ion possesses a distorted
tetrahedral coordination sphere built by the phenolate oxygens (Zn–O
distances of 1.990(3) and 1.999(3) Å) and two chlorides (Zn–Cl
of 2.1929(12) and 2.2057(12) Å). The coordination angles about
Zn are in the range 110.56(10)–120.12(10)° with the exception
of O(1)–Zn–O(2) of 76.56(11)°. The salicylaldimine
moieties are tilted to form a dihedral angle of 23.30°.

In complex 4, the geometry around copper can be best
described as a distorted square pyramidal geometry as indicated by
the τ parameter value of 0.125 (τ = 0 and 1 for a perfect
square-pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal geometry, respectively).31 The basal plane of the five-coordinated Cu ion
consists of two amine nitrogen atoms (Cu–N bond distances of
1.937(3) and 1.979(3) Å) and two phenolic oxygens (Cu–O
bond distances 1.951(2) and 1.925(2) Å), whereas the apical position
is occupied by a bridging nitrite oxygen atom (Cu–O(3′)
of 2.593(3) Å). The two salicylaldimine moieties are tilted about
the central copper atom, forming a dihedral angle of 23.95°.
The zinc ion exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry in an O6 donor set realized by two bridging nitrite anions and by
the phenolate oxygen atoms. The Zn–O(phenol) distances are
2.030(2) and 2.018(2) Å, whereas Zn–O(nitrite) is significantly
longer in between 2.143(3) and 2.223(3) Å. The deviations from
the ideal octahedral geometry are clearly demonstrated by the coordination
bond angles reported in Table S5; these
vary from ca. 57° for the bridging anions to 147.75(11)°.

It is worth noting the similarity in the arrangement of the metal
atoms in the tetranuclear core (Figure 8). In fact, the Cu–Zn and Cu–Zn′
intermetallic distances are 3.0709(5) and 4.7024(5) Å, respectively,
in complex 4, to be compared with the corresponding figures
in 3 of 3.0526(8) and 4.6117(8) Å, respectively.

Solution Studies: Mass Spectrometry
In order to determine
the compositions of heteronuclear complexes essential to understand
their solution chemistry, we have performed the mass spectral study
in the DMSO–acetonitrile mixture. All of the mass spectra are
given in the Supporting Information (Figures
S9–S12). Complex 1 dissociates into two species
with a base peak of 1063.0159 amu ([CuL2Zn(dca)(H2O)]+, calcd 1063.9759 amu) and a small peak arising at
1015.0287 amu (calcd 1091.9767 amu) responsible for the monocation
[CuL2Zn(H2O)2]+. Complex 2 on the other hand displays only one peak, i.e., the base
peak arising at 1043.6355 amu for the formation of the monocation
[CuL2Zn(NO2)(H2O)]+. These
species ought to be formed because of the stepwise ionization of the
coligands dicyanamide for the first one and nitrate for the latter.
Complexes 3 and 4 dissociate into dinuclear
heterocomplexes as evident from their mass spectra, the base peaks
appear at 555.0591 amu (calcd 555.9127 amu) and 566.1590 amu (calcd
566.9367 amu), respectively. In the case of 3 and 4, two hetero-dinuclear moieties are coordinated by weak chloro
or nitrito interaction, which disrupts upon solvation to produce the
monopositive hetero-dinuclear species.

Theoretical Rationalization
of Anion-Dependent Structural Variation
Experimentally, the
nuclearity of the complexes formed by the ML
CuL depends on the nature of the counter anion (see Figure S8). That is, compound 1 is a trinuclear
dca (dicyanamide)-bridged polymer, compound 2 (NO3–) is a trinuclear (Cu2Zn) monomeric
complex, and compounds 3 (Cl–) and 4 (NO2–) are tetranuclear (Cu2Zn2) monomeric complexes. The present DFT study
is intended to give some insights into the different nuclearities
observed in these complexes. We have focused our analysis to compounds 2–4 because the polymeric nature of 1 can
be simply rationalized by considering the intrinsic linear geometry
of the dicyanamide ligand. For this study, we have fully optimized
in MeOH compounds 2–4 and also the hypothetical
tetranuclear complex 2′ (Figure 9d) and trinuclear complexes 3′ and 4′ (Figure 9b,c). The geometric features of the optimized complexes
(given in Figure 9)
are in good agreement with the X-ray geometries, giving reliability
to the level of theory used herein. In Figure 9, we also include the energetic results for
the hypothetical transformation of the trinuclear complexes to the
tetranuclear ones by the reaction with the appropriate Zn(II) salt.
The transformation of the trinuclear complex into the tetranuclear
one is energetically favorable in all cases. However, in the solid
state, the tetranuclear complex is only observed for Cl– and NO2– anions (compounds 3 and 4). Therefore, this DFT preliminary analysis is
not able to explain the formation of the trinuclear complex 2. Moreover, stoichiometrically, the CuL/Zn proportion used
(2:1) is adequate for the formation of the trinuclear assembly. Therefore,
the formation of the tetranuclear complexes in 3 and 4 implies that a significant proportion of ML has not reacted.

geometries of compounds 2–4 (a,e,f,
respectively) and their hypothetical complexes 2′–4′ (d,b,c, respectively). Distances in Å.

In general, the rationalization of the nuclearity is complicated
because in the solid state, the packing forces and noncovalent interactions
with the neighbor molecules are crucial in determining the final solid-state
architecture. Therefore, the most-favored nuclearity in the solid
state can be different than that in the solution state. The main difference
between compounds 2 (trinuclear) and 4 (tetranuclear)
is simply the presence of an additional O atom in the anion (nitrate
vs nitrite). This uncoordinated O atom in 2 is pointing
to the external part of the complex, perfectly suited for establishing
intermolecular interactions. We have analyzed this issue by examining
the crystal packing of 2. We have found that each NO3– anion in 2 establishes an
H-bonding interaction with the adjacent molecule. We have computed
the interaction energy of the assembly shown in Figure 9 (using the crystallographic coordinates),
which is ΔE4 = −29.8 kcal/mol.
Interestingly, this interaction energy is able to compensate the −21.9
kcal/mol difference between the trinuclear and tetranuclear complexes
in MeOH. Keeping in mind the complexity of the intricate combination
of forces present in the solid state, we propose that the formation
of compound 2 (trinuclear) is due to the formation of
additional interactions in the solid state that are able to compensate
the energetic difference with the tetranuclear one. However, compounds 3 and 4 crystallize in their most stable solution
form, indicating that the additional interactions of their hypothetical
trinuclear complexes are not able to compensate the energetic differences
shown in Figure 9.

Biological Studies
The cytotoxic effect of the investigated
metal complexes was examined against HeLa cancer cell lines using
the XTT assay; IC50 values are summarized in Table 1. It is clearly seen that all
of the compounds 1–4 are cytotoxic
to the studied cell with IC50 values very close to 1 μM.
From all of these compounds and considering the standard deviation,
the most active complex was 3 with 2 and 4 being very close in cytotoxicity. It seems that the structural
similarities of the compounds are correlated with very uniform cytotoxic
activities.

In general, the compounds reported here showed a much
higher cytotoxicity
than other reported zinc or copper compounds with similar ligands
which were found in the literature to be up to two magnitude orders
less cytotoxic than 1–4.32−34 It seems that
the compounds present a higher cytotoxic activity because of the synergic
effect of both metal ions Cu and Zn.

However, we have also carried
out the study of the toxicity of 1–4 against normal
cells (human bone marrow stroma
cells HS-5 and human lung fibroblasts MRC-5); unfortunately, the compounds
do not show selectivity against cancer cells on direct comparison
with HS-5 or MRC-5. This is maybe due to the mechanism of cytotoxication
of the compounds which is likely based on the generation of reactive
nitrogen species (RNS) or reactive oxygen species (ROS) because of
the NO-containing ligands of compounds 1–4.35,36 In this context, normal cells are usually more sensitive to RNS
or ROS; therefore, future studies of our research groups will be focused
on the design of novel heterometallic compounds including recognizable
fragments (such as folates or similar) whose receptors are usually
over-expressed in cancer cells. In this context, we think that the
compounds may be selective toward cancer cell lines and improve their
applicability in future chemotherapeutic treatments (Figure 10).

DNA Interaction Study
The determination of the binding
properties of metal complexes with molecules of biological interest
can be carried out by a study of the evaluation of the interactions
of metallodrugs with DNA by UV–visible absorption spectroscopy.
Binding to biomacromolecules is usually associated with modifications
of the electronic spectrum of both the compounds, which is interacting
or the biomolecule.37 It is generally agreed
that hypochromism and bathochromism effects mean an intercalation
of the metallodrug to DNA associated with strong (π →
π*) stacking interactions between aromatic chromophores of the
studied binding complex and DNA base pairs.38,39 Additionally, the hyperchromism effect is usually associated with
the interaction of the metal complex with the minor groove of DNA,
meaning an unwinding of the DNA double helix leading to unstack and
exposure of the nitrogen bases of the DNA chain.40,41 As an example, Figure 11 shows the electronic absorption spectra of 3 (one of the most active compounds of the present series) in the
absence and presence of FS-DNA.

Figure 11 Electronic spectra of complex 3 in a buffer solution
(5 mM Tris-HCl/50 mM NaCl at pH 7.4) without and with the addition
of different concentrations of FS-DNA. C(complex)
= 1.5 × 10–5 mol L–1 and C(DNA) = 0–5 × 10–5 mol L–1. Arrow shows that the absorption intensities increase
upon increasing the DNA concentration. Inset: Plot of [DNA]/[εa – εf] vs [DNA] for the titration
of complex 3 with DNA.

In our study, we have observed that the addition of increasing
amounts of DNA to the studied compounds 1–4 leads
to hyperchromism (increase of absorption intensity) in the UV–visible
absorption spectrum which is a consequence of the minor groove binding
of complexes 1–4 to DNA and the unwinding of the
DNA double helix. In addition, we observed a slight blue shift in
the absorption maximum which confirms the possibility of an electrostatic
interaction between the studied compounds 1–4 and
the DNA chain.

In order to compare the binding strengths of
the complexes, the
intrinsic binding constant, Kb, was determined
using the following eq 1.42 1  where [DNA] is the concentration of DNA in
base pairs, εa, εf, and εb correspond to Aobs/[complex],
the extinction coefficient of the free complexes, and the extinction
coefficient of the complexes in the fully bound form, respectively,
and Kb is the intrinsic binding constant.
The ratio of slope to intercept in the plot of [DNA]/(εa – εf) versus [DNA] gives the value
of Kb (inset Figure 11).

Using this method, the intrinsic
binding constants of compounds 1–4 were, respectively,
of 3.61 × 104, 2.92 × 104, 4.24 ×
104, and 2.88
× 104 M–1, observing that they are
all in the same order of magnitude. The highest binding constant is
found for compound 3 which again, as in the case of the
study of the cytotoxic activity, seems to have a slightly higher binding
ability to DNA.

Fluorescence MB Experiments
Additional
fluorescence
experiments were carried out to get more insights on the mechanism
of interaction of complex 3. Thus, a competitive measurement
in the presence of the typical intercalator MB was carried out. It
is well known that MB is a planar molecule that has usually been utilized
for dying in different specific biological assays.43 MB usually inserts into each of the DNA strands because
of its positive charge which can electrostatically interact with DNA
anions giving intercalating bonds which are irreversible. This makes
that the emission and absorption spectra of the MB adducts highly
depend on the type of the bond.44,45

Thus, a fluorescence
method was carried out to investigate the interaction of complex 3 with an adduct DNA–MB ([DNA]/[MB] = 10) using increasing
concentrations of the metallodrug. After the addition of 3, the emission intensities of the adducts were recorded, observing
that the addition of 3 seems to quench the MB emission
intensity, so that the emission spectra of MB-DNA solutions decreased
considerably in the presence of increasing amounts of 3 (Figure 12). This
is an indication of a possible insertion of the complex into the DNA
double helix, which is associated with an intercalative binding behavior
as observed in the previous studies using UV spectroscopy.

Protein Binding Studies
Interactions
with BSA Determined by Absorption UV-Spectroscopy
Albumin
is a very important transport protein which is usually
contributing to the transport of some external agents to the interior
of the cells. Thus, structural changes in the mechanism of complex
formation in the donor–acceptor system characteristic of metallodrug
interactions with different proteins such as albumin can be studied
by UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. This method is very
effective to determine changes in the absorption bands to determine
and understand the interactions of metal complexes with proteins.46 The absorption spectrum of BSA has two simple
bands at 220 and 280 nm because of the absorption peak of BSA polypeptide
structure and the different aromatic amino acids which can be found
in the protein structure (tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine).
In this context, as the transport of the metallodrug might be one
of the processes for a hypothetical cell internalization of the complex,
the interaction between 3 and the transport protein albumin
was determined on the basis of the UV–visible absorption spectra.

The structural changes in BSA are usually indicated by variations
in the absorption band between 220 and 240 nm; in addition, changes
at 280 nm are usually induced by changes in the sub-environments around
BSA amino acids. For complex 3, the BSA absorption intensity
significantly decreased and in some cases almost disappears in the
range of 220–240 nm upon addition of increasing amounts of
the metallodrug (Figure 13). As a consequence of the changes in the protein structure,
it is possible to observe a softer change on the maximum absorption
at 280 nm, which is indicating clear structural changes with the α-helix
of the primary substructure of the protein which is probably a consequence
of a specific interaction between 3 and BSA.47 These results indicated a high interaction of 3 with albumin, confirming that this transport protein may
be one of the possible biological targets inducing the transport of
this complex inside cells.

Figure 13 UV–visible absorption spectra for BSA
in Tris-buffer in
the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of 3.

BSA Tryptophan Quenching
BSA fluorescence is generally
due to tryptophan (Trp) of BSA located on the surface of domain, Trp-213
of the hydrophobic pocket of domain II, and phenyl alanine (Phe) residues.
Usually, solutions of BSA present a fluorescence emission at 345 nm
which is due to tryptophan residues, upon excitation at 285 nm. The
fluorescence intensity of the peak 345 nm decreased upon increasing
concentrations of metal complex which confirms the conformational
changes in the secondary structure of the protein due to interaction
with complex 3 which quenches its intrinsic fluorescence. The quenching
mechanism between complex 3 and BSA is described by the
linear Stern–Volmer equation (eq 2). 2  where F0 and F are BSA fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence
of metal complex, respectively, and Kq, Ksv, τ0, and [Q] are
the BSA quenching rate constant, the dynamic quenching constant, the
average BSA lifetime in the absence of quencher (estimated in 10–8 s–1) and the quencher concentration,
respectively.

Using this method, we were able to determine Ksv for complex 3 which was 1.02
× 1012 M–1 s–1 which is in the range for other metal-based drugs.48 These results are in agreement with a static quenching
interaction as reported previously for similar compounds.48

Determination of Binding Constant BSA-3 and
the Number of Binding
Sites
For the determination of the binding constant (Ka) and the number of binding sites (n) for the static quenching interaction, assuming similar
and independent binding sites in the biomolecule, the following equation
(eq 3) is governing the
fluorescence emission 3  where n is the average number
of binding sites per albumin molecule and Ka is the binding constant in the protein complex interaction. For
the system complex 3—BSA, Ka and n values at room temperature were 3.31
× 103 M–1 and 0.78, respectively.
These results show that complex 3 has a moderate binding
constant44 and that 3 is implied
in only a single binding site in each albumin.

Conclusions
The applications of heterometallic compounds are majorly being
concentrated over the branch of magnetism. Numerous researchers are
busy cultivating the magnetic properties in order to develop SMM and
other magnetic devices, becoming the route over-saturated while leaving
the biomedical applications untouched. This furnishes us the sufficient
opportunity to investigate the clinical values of these heterometallic
systems by employing them in different biological tests as therapeutic
drugs. In order to carry out the job, we have taken two different
biorelevant transition metals copper and zinc to incorporate in a
single framework. Four different heterometallic complexes were obtained
from these systems by varying the corresponding coligands. Strikingly,
all of them have found to show high biomedical properties. The complexes
demonstrate moderate cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells as evidenced
by the XTT assay. Also, they provide high DNA binding capability through
intercalative mechanism, and finally, they can be successfully transported
as a drug to cells as verified by the BSA protein transport mechanism.
In the latter two cases, fluorescence quenching studies have been
carried out to get insight into the detailed mechanistic pathways.
All of these experimental results show that the heterometallic complexes
exhibit high cytotoxicity and binding constants and their values are
quite a fold increase with respect to similar homometallic complexes.
Finally, from this study, we are able to conclude that heterometallic
complexes have better biomedical values and can be constructed as
therapeutic drugs, advancement of their clinical properties possibly
owing to the better interaction (synergic effect) of different metals
with a single biological target.

A
Bruker Smart Apex diffractometer (Mo Kα radiation, λ =
0.71073 Å) equipped with a charge-coupled device was utilized
to collect the intensity data for crystal structure analyses of ML
and all of the compounds 1–4 at room temperature.
For cell refinement, indexing, and scaling of the data sets, the program
Bruker Smart Apex and Bruker Saint packages49 were used. All structures were solved by direct methods and subsequent
Fourier analyses50 and refined by the full-matrix
least-squares method based on F2 with
all observed reflections.50 Bridging nitrate
anion in compound 2 was found disordered on two positions,
refined at half occupancy with isotropic thermal ellipsoids. In addition,
in complex 2, the ΔF map revealed
the presence of a residual interpreted as oxygen water at half occupancy.
All hydrogen atoms were placed at calculated positions and included
in final cycles of refinement. H atoms of the water molecule in 2 at half occupancy were not located. WinGX System, Ver 2013.351 was employed to perform all of the required
calculations. Crystal data and details of refinements are given in Table S1.
