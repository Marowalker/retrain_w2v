In
this work, we report the synthesis of hydrophilic and surface-functionalized
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) to utilize them
as nanomedicines for treating liver cancer via magnetic fluid hyperthermia
(MFH)-based thermotherapy. For this purpose, initially, we have synthesized
the SPIOs through co-precipitation/thermolysis methods, followed by
in situ surface functionalization with short-chained molecules, such
as 1,4-diaminobenzene (14DAB), 4-aminobenzoic acid (4ABA) and 3,4-diaminobenzoic
acid (34DABA) and their combination with terephthalic acid (TA)/2-aminoterephthalic
acid (ATA)/trimesic acid (TMA)/pyromellitic acid (PMA) molecules.
The as-prepared SPIOs are investigated for their structure, morphology,
water dispersibility, and magnetic properties. The heating efficacies
of the SPIOs are studied in calorimetric MFH (C-MFH) with respect
to their concentrations, surface coatings, dispersion medium, and
applied alternating magnetic fields (AMFs). Although all of the as-prepared
SPIOs have exhibited superparamagnetic behavior, only 14DAB-, 4ABA-,
34DABA-, and 4ABA-TA-coated SPIOs have shown higher magnetization
values (Ms = 55–71 emu g–1) and good water dispersibility. In C-MFH studies, 34DABA-coated
SPIO-based aqueous ferrofluid (AFF) has revealed faster thermal response
to the applied AMF and reached therapeutic temperature even at the
lowest concentration (0.5 mg mL–1) compared with
14DAB-, 4ABA-, and 4ABA-TA-coated SPIO-based AFFs. Moreover, 34DABA-coated
SPIO-based AFF has exhibited high heating efficacies (i.e., specific
absorption rate/intrinsic loss power values of 432.1 W gFe–1/5.2 nHm2 kg–1 at
0.5 mg mL–1), which could be mainly due to (i) enhanced
π–π conjugation paths of surface-attached 34DABA
coating molecules because of intrafunctional group attractions and
(ii) improved anisotropy from the formation of clusters/linear chains
of the SPIOs in ferrofluid suspensions, owing to interfunctional group
attractions/interparticle interactions. Moreover, the 34DABA-coated
SPIOs have demonstrated (i) very good cytocompatibility for 24/48
h incubation periods and (ii) higher killing efficiency of 61–88%
(via MFH) in HepG2 liver cancer cells as compared to their treatment
with only AMF/water-bath-based thermotherapy. In summary, the 34DABA-coated
SPIOs are very promising heat-inducing agents for MFH-based thermotherapy
and thus could be used as effective nanomedicines for cancer treatments.

1 Introduction
Cancer is one of the dreadful diseases that claimed many lives
worldwide. Among different clinical therapies (including radiotherapy,
chemotherapy, and photothermal therapy), magnetic fluid hyperthermia
(MFH)-based thermotherapy has garnered major attention in the treatment
of cancer, wherein superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs,
in particular magnetite/maghemite, Fe3O4/Fe2O3) are primarily used to induce localized therapeutic
heat (42–45 °C) inside the malignant tumors.1−3 SPIOs are single-domain nanoparticles with superparamagnetic size
(<20 nm)4,5 and extensively studied for MFH-based cancer
thermotherapy in the form of ferrofluids (FFs) by dispersing them
in a carrier liquid (for e.g., water/biological media).6−8 SPIOs are usually coated with different surface coating molecules,
such as citrates, dextran, chitosan, sugars, silica, and polymers,
to attain good dispersibility in the carrier liquid by inhibiting
their agglomerations due to (i) the magnetic/interparticle attractions
and (ii) the interactions between the surface of the SPIOs and the
surrounding liquid media.9−11 However, these long-chained surface
coating molecules subsequently modify (i) physicochemical properties
(size, shape, and/or crystallinity), (ii) magnetic properties (saturation
magnetization, Ms), (iii) water dispersibility
(hydrodynamic size and/or ζ-potential), and (iv) biocompatibility
of the SPIOs. Recently, many researchers investigated the alteration
in the heating efficiencies of the SPIOs (in terms of specific absorption
rate, SAR (W gFe–1)/intrinsic loss power,
ILP (nHm2 kg–1)) with respect to their
physicochemical/magnetic/dispersibility/biocompatibility properties.12−17 However, very less care is given to investigate the influence of
the factors, including concentrations, surface coatings, applied alternating
magnetic fields (AMFs with specific amplitudes (H) and frequencies (f)), and dispersion media, for
improving the heating efficiency of the SPIOs in MFH studies. Moreover,
the SPIO-based ferrofluids have been utilized at very high concentrations
to investigate their heating efficiencies, which make them unsuitable
for subsequent MFH-based cancer thermotherapies. Therefore, there
is a need for synthesizing in situ functionalized SPIOs (with suitable
short-chained molecules) to attain better water dispersibility, biocompatibility,
and high magnetic saturation for achieving enhanced heating efficacies
at their lower concentrations in appropriate AMFs (H × f—near to Hergt’s biological-safety
limit).

Previously, we have reported the synthesis of hydrophilic
SPIOs
in situ functionalized with short-chained surface coating molecules
(with minimum of two carboxyl functional groups), such as terephthalic
acid (TA), aminoterephthalic acid (ATA), trimesic acid (TMA), and
pyromellitic acid (PMA), followed by the investigation of their heating
efficacy under applied AMFs.18,19 In this work, for the
first time, we report the synthesis of hydrophilic SPIOs in situ functionalized
with short-chained surface coating molecules (with one or more amine
functional groups), such as 1,4-diaminobenzene (14DAB), 4-aminobenzoic
acid (4ABA), and 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid (34DABA), and their combination
with the TA/ATA/TMA/PMA molecules via co-precipitation/thermolysis
methods. These surface coating molecules are chosen because they have
(i) π–π conjugations to enhance the saturation
magnetization of the SPIO core and magnetic response to the AMF for
improving their heating efficacies and (ii) amine/carboxyl functional
groups for providing them good water dispersibility in a carrier liquid
medium and for further bio-/chemical-conjugations. The as-synthesized
SPIOs are characterized to investigate their magnetic/physicochemical/water-dispersibility
properties. The heating efficiencies of the SPIOs (in terms of SAR/ILP
values) influenced by the fundamental parameters, including surface
coatings, concentrations, applied AMFs (with H × f values of 2.4–9.9 GAm–1 s–1), and dispersion media of their ferrofluid suspension
are explored via
calorimetric MFH (C-MFH) studies. Moreover, the selected SPIOs (with
enhanced saturation magnetization, water dispersibility, and SAR/ILP
values) are further studied for in vitro MFH-based thermotherapy for
the treatment of liver (HepG2) cancer and compared with the water-bath
based conventional thermotherapy (WCTT, without SPIOs).

(PBS), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and Dulbecco’s modified eagle
medium (DMEM) are purchased from Gibco Life technologies.

2.2 Synthesis Methods
SPIOs are synthesized
via chemical co-precipitation and thermolysis methods, as reported
elsewhere, with some minor modifications.19 The SPIOs are in situ surface functionalized by using individual
14DAB, 4ABA, and 34DABA molecules (i.e., single surfactant) and their
combination with TA/ATA/TMA/PMA molecules (i.e., dual surfactants). Scheme 1A,B represents the
surface coating molecules (i.e., 14DAB, 4ABA, 34DABA, TA, ATA, TMA,
and PMA) and chemical synthesis of surface-functionalized SPIOs, respectively.

(ii) interfunctional group interactions, and (iii) interparticle interactions.

2.2.1 Co-precipitation Method
Briefly,
to synthesize single-surfactant-coated SPIOs, iron (III) and (II)
chlorides in a 2:1 molar ratio and appropriate amount of 14DAB or
4ABA or 34DABA are mixed in Millipore water. The mixture solution
is heated to 80 °C and magnetically stirred for 60 min under
nitrogen (N2) atmosphere. Then, NH4OH is added
to the mixture solution and vigorously stirred for another 60 min
at the same temperature. Thereafter, the resultant solution is cooled
to room temperature by removing the heat source. At last, the precipitated
nanoparticles are magnetically separated and then washed with 1:1
(v/v) mixture of Millipore water and ethanol. Moreover, the dual surfactant-coated
SPIOs are prepared in a similar fashion by using 14DAB/4ABA/34DABA
molecules combined with TA/ATA/TMA/PMA molecules in an equal molar
ratio.

2.2.2 Thermolysis Method
Briefly, to
synthesize single-surfactant-coated SPIOs, iron (III) acetylacetonate
and 14DAB or 4ABA or 34DABA molecules are dissolved in TEG and the
mixture solution is dehydrated at 120 °C for 60 min under N2 atmosphere. Then, the mixture solution is further heated
to a specific refluxing temperature (refer Table S1) and maintained for another 60 min. Thereafter, the resultant
mixture solution is brought down to room temperature by removing the
heat source. At last, the precipitated nanoparticles are magnetically
separated and then washed with 1:1 (v/v) mixture of Millipore water
and ethanol. Moreover, the dual surfactant-coated SPIOs are prepared
in a similar manner by using 14DAB/4ABA/34DABA molecules combined
with TA/ATA/TMA/PMA molecules in an equal molar ratio.

2.2.3 SPIO Samples
The sample details
along with the reaction conditions, including the temperature, time,
and the surfactant(s) (single/dual category) for co-precipitation
and thermolysis methods are given in Table S1. The SPIOs S1, S2, S11, and S12 are formed using the single surfactant,
i.e., 14DAB and 4ABA molecules via both the co-precipitation and thermolysis
methods, whereas the SPIO S3 is formed only via co-precipitation but
not by the thermolysis method using the single surfactant, i.e., 34DABA
molecules. The SPIOs S4, S5, S8, S9, S13, S14, S15, and S16 are also
formed using 14DAB-TA, 14DAB-ATA, 4ABA-TA, and 4ABA-ATA dual surfactants
through both the co-precipitation and thermolysis methods. However,
the SPIOs S6, S7, and S10 are formed using 14DAB-TMA, 14DAB-PMA, and
4ABA-PMA dual surfactants only via co-precipitation but not by the
thermolysis method. Moreover, the SPIOs are not formed using 34DABA-TA,
34DABA-ATA, 34DABA-TMA, and 34DABA-PMA dual surfactants via both the
co-precipitation and thermolysis methods.

2.2.4 Ferrofluid
(FF) Samples
Aqueous
ferrofluids (AFFs) are prepared by dispersing the as-synthesized single/dual
surfactant(s)-coated SPIOs in a definite volume of aqueous medium,
and the iron (Fe) concentrations are determined via UV–vis
spectrophotometry. Briefly, the AFFs are digested with HCl at 80 °C
for 2 h after proper dilution. Then, the resultant solution is mixed
with APS and KSCN (0.1 M) to form a red-colored iron–thiocyanate
complex, whose absorbance is measured at 474 nm to determine the Fe
concentration with reference to a standard curve. Thereafter, AFFs
are diluted with water to obtain the concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2,
4, and 8 mgFe mL–1 (hereafter marked
as mg mL–1) accordingly.

To prepare the FFs
in other media, appropriate amount of AFFs are taken in a vial and
then the SPIOs are magnetically separated completely from the aqueous
medium and subsequently dispersed in a definite volume of (i) nonbiological
media, EG, DEG, TEG, and GC, and (ii) biological media, PBS, DMEM,
DMEM + 5% FBS, and FBS, through a vigorous vortexing process to provide
nonbiological FFs (NBFFs) and biological FFs (BFFs), respectively.

2.3 Materials Characterization
As-prepared
SPIOs are initially characterized via a thermogravimetric analyzer
(TGA, SII 6300 EXSTAR) in a temperature range of 30–800 °C
and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, PAR 155) at room temperature
to investigate their amount of surface coatings and magnetic properties,
respectively. The selected SPIOs (on the basis of the TGA/VSM results)
are further characterized by using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
(FTIR, ThermoFisher Scientific Nicolet iS 5, by following the potassium
bromide (KBr) pellet method), transmission electron microscope (TEM,
Technai G2 20 S-TWIN, operated at 200 kV), and X-ray diffraction (XRD,
Bruker D8 Advance—Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 nm) with a scan
range (2θ) of 20–80°) to identify their structure
(in terms of attached surface coating molecules and phase purity)
and morphology (i.e., size and shape). Moreover, the hydrodynamic
diameters and ζ-potentials of the selected SPIOs are determined
via the dynamic light scattering (DLS, Horiba nanoPartica SZ-100-Z,
equipped with a 532 nm laser) technique by considering the average
of three readings.

2.4 Calorimetric MFH Studies
The heating
profiles of the SPIOs in the form of AFFs are investigated via calorimetric
MFH (C-MFH) studies by using a magnetic hyperthermia instrument (magneTherm-nanoTherics).20 Briefly, 1 mL of the AFFs with concentrations
of 0.5–8 mg mL–1 is taken in a sample vial,
which is enclosed in a Styrofoam-based container and kept inside the
induction coils (which is sustained at ∼37 °C via a water
recirculating chiller) of the hyperthermia instrument. The initial
temperature of AFFs is observed using an optical probe for 120 s to
ensure that the temperature from the coils does not induce any heat
on the ferrofluids. Then, the AFFs are subjected to AMFs at specific
amplitudes (H = 7–18 kA m–1) and frequencies (f = 175–1001 kHz). Subsequently,
the time-dependent temperature (TDT) rise of the AFFs is determined
till the temperature reaches a fixed temperature (45 °C) or maximum
temperature (≤45 °C) within 30 min (1800 s). Then, the
heating efficiencies of AFFs are calculated in terms of SAR, considering
the initial slopes of TDT curves as per the following equation 1  where Csamp and
ρsamp are the specific heat capacity and density
of the dispersion medium of AFF, respectively, mFe
is the mass fraction of Fe (in grams) in FFs, and ΔT/Δt is the initial slope from TDT curve. Similarly,
the TDT rise experiments are performed for NBFFs and BFFs and the
corresponding SAR values are calculated. Moreover, intrinsic loss
power (ILP, nHm2 kg–1, based on normalized
SAR) values are also calculated for the AFFs/NBFFs/BFFs as per the
following equation 2  

2.5 Biological Studies
2.5.1 In
Vitro Cell Viability
In vitro
cell viability of the selected SPIOs is determined in liver (HepG2)
cancer cells via trypan blue assay at two different time periods (24
and 48 h) on the basis of the standard protocol, as reported elsewhere,
with minor modifications.21,22 At the beginning, HepG2
cancer cells are seeded in 24-well plates with a density of ∼35 000
cells per well and incubated for 24 h. Then, the SPIOs at specific
concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 μgFe) per well
are incubated in triplicates at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After 24/48 h incubation period, the cancer cells are washed with
PBS twice and optical microscopic images (Leica DMi1 inverted microscope)
are taken to confirm the presence of the SPIOs. Later, the cells are
detached by using trypsin and then small aliquots of HepG2 cancer
cells are mixed with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue. Finally,
the number of live and dead cells is counted via a hemocytometer (Neubauer
Chamber, Gem instruments) and the cell viability is calculated (n = 3) by using the following formula 3  where the unstained cells
indicate the live
cells and the stained cells indicate the dead cells due to the exposure
of cellular components to the trypan blue dye.

2.5.2 In Vitro MFH and WCTT
In vitro
MFH studies are performed as reported elsewhere, with some minor alterations.21,23,24 Herein, 1 × 106 liver (HepG2) cancer cells in DMEM medium (with 10% FBS) are centrifuged
to obtain a pellet, which is resuspended in media containing the selected
SPIOs at two different concentrations, i.e., 0.5 and 1 mg mL–1. Then, they are subjected to AMF (with an amplitude of 10.9 kA m–1 at a frequency of 751.51 kHz) to reach the therapeutic
temperature (42 °C), which is then maintained for the next 60
min by attuning the AMF. In addition, the equal number of liver cancer
cells is (i) treated under same AMF (without SPIOs) and (ii) incubated
with only SPIOs (without AMF) at 0.5 and 1 mg mL–1 concentration. After MFH treatment, ∼40 μL of cell
suspension (equivalent to ∼40 000 cells) is mixed with
appropriate media and plated in triplicates, followed by 72 h of incubation
at 37 °C under 5% CO2. A similar procedure is followed
for the cells treated with only AMF and only SPIOs at 0.5 and 1 mg
mL–1 concentrations. Finally, the trypan blue assay
is performed to determine the viability of cancer cells after washing
the wells with PBS twice, where microscopic images are taken after
the washing process.

Moreover, in vitro water-bath-based conventional
thermotherapy (WCTT) is performed as reported elsewhere, with some
minor modifications.25 Briefly, 1 ×
106 HepG2 cancer cells (in a vial) are subjected to therapeutic
heat at 42 °C. Herein, a recirculating chiller (Grant Instruments,
U.K.) is used to reach the therapeutic temperature (42 °C) in
the cell suspension (from the initial temperature of 30 °C) and
maintained for 60 min. Moreover, the vial is taken out every 15 min
and slightly tapped for 5 s to make a uniform suspension
and further involved in WCTT. Later, ∼40 μL of cell suspension
is taken, resuspended in media, plated in triplicates in a 24-well
plate, and then incubated for 72 h. Finally, the viability of the
cancer cells is determined via the trypan blue assay after washing
the wells with PBS twice, where microscopic images are taken after
the washing process. The cells without AMF/SPIOs/SPIOs + MFH/WCTT
are used as a control.

2.5.3 In Vitro Cellular Uptake
Intracellular
uptake of the SPIOs is qualitatively determined during (i) cytotoxicity
and (ii) MFH experiments via the Prussian blue staining method, as
reported elsewhere, with minor modifications.26 At first, similar to the cytotoxicity experiments, the SPIOs at
15 μgFe concentration are incubated with cancer cells
(having initial density of ∼35 000 cells per well) in
triplicates for 24/48 h. After the incubation period, the cells are
fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min and then incubated for another
20 min with a mixture solution of HCl and potassium hexacyanoferrate
(each 4%). Finally, the wells are washed with PBS twice and then the
microscopic images are taken to confirm the in vitro uptake of SPIOs
by the cancer cells. In a similar fashion, after the MFH treatment,
the cancer cells with/without SPIOs/SPIOs + MFH are incubated for
72 h, then dyed with Prussian blue as mentioned above and finally
the microscopic images are taken after washing with PBS twice.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Surface
Coatings and Magnetic Properties
Initially, surface coatings
and magnetic properties of all of the
as-prepared SPIOs (via co-precipitation and thermolysis methods) are
characterized through TGA and VSM.

3.1.1 TGA
Figures 1A(i–iv), S1A(i–vi), and S1B(i–vi) show the TGA curves of all of the SPIO
samples (S1–S16). The TGA curves show two weight losses: (i)
primary loss in the temperature range of 30–200 °C and
(ii) secondary loss in the temperature range of 200–800 °C
due to the decomposition of physically adsorbed water molecules and
chemically adsorbed surface coatings, respectively. The corresponding
amounts of the single/dual surfactant(s) attached to the surface of
the SPIOs are given in Table S2. It can
be seen that the amount of surface coatings are comparably lower for
the single surfactant-coated SPIOs (S1–S3 and S11–S12)
than the dual surfactant-coated SPIOs (S4–S10 and S13–S16)
synthesized via co-precipitation and thermolysis methods.

of the SPIOs: (i) S1 (14DAB-coated), (ii) S2 (4ABA-coated),
(iii) S3 (34DABA-coated), and (iv) S8 (4ABA-TA-coated). (B) VSM curves
of the SPIOs: (i) S1 (14DAB-coated), (ii) S2 (4ABA-coated), (iii)
S3 (34DABA-coated), and (iv) S8 (4ABA-TA-coated). (C) FTIR spectra
of the SPIOs: (i) S1 (14DAB-coated), (ii) S2 (4ABA-coated), (iii)
S3 (34DABA-coated), and (iv) S8 (4ABA-TA-coated).

3.1.2 VSM
Figures 1B(i–iv), S2A(i–vi), and S2B(i–vi) show the magnetization (M–H) curves of all of the SPIOs (S1–S16)
at room temperature, and the corresponding magnetization (Ms) values are given in Table S2. Zero coercivity and zero remanence of the M–H curves confirm the superparamagnetic behavior
of all of the SPIOs.27

In the co-precipitation
process, S1, S2, and S3 (i.e., the SPIOs coated with single surfactant,
14DAB, 4ABA, and 34DABA, molecules) have shown respective Ms values of 60.4, 62.8, and 71.3 emu g–1. On the other hand, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, and S10 (i.e., the SPIOs
coated with dual surfactants, 14DAB-TA, 14DAB-ATA, 14DAB-TMA, 14DAB-PMA,
4ABA-TA, 4ABA-ATA, and 4ABA-PMA molecules) have shown the Ms values of 16.8, 21.3, 21.9, 15.2, 54.5, 16.7,
and 46.2 emu g–1, respectively.

Similarly,
in the thermolysis process, S11 and S12 (i.e., the SPIOs
coated with single surfactants, 14DAB and 4ABA molecules) have shown
respective Ms values of 40.8 and 46.8
emu g–1, respectively. On the other hand, S13, S14,
S15, and S16 (i.e., the SPIOs coated with dual surfactants, 14DAB-TA,
14DAB-ATA, 4ABA-TA, and 4ABA-ATA molecules) have shown the Ms values of 5.5, 7.2, 44.9, and 24.4 emu g–1, respectively.

It can be seen that dual-surfactant-coated
SPIOs (S4–S7,
S9, S10, S13, S14, and S16) have shown lower Ms values than the single-surfactant-coated SPIOs (S1–S3
and S11–S12) due to large amounts of surface coating for the
dual-surfactant-coated SPIOs except 4ABA-TA-coated SPIOs (S8 and S15)
that have shown slightly higher Ms values
due to the small amount of surface coatings (as confirmed by the TGA
results). The highest Ms value of 71.3
emu g–1 is attained for the 34DABA-coated SPIOs
(S3) due to the lowest amount of surface coatings, as confirmed by
the TGA as well.

Thus, on the basis of the TGA/VSM results,
the S1, S2, S3, and
S8 (refer Table 1)
are selected for further characterizations due to their lower amount
of surface coatings that correspond to their higher saturation magnetization
(Ms) values, i.e., above 50 emu g–1, which is essential to attain enhanced heating effects
in MFH studies.18

3.2 Structure,
Morphology, and Dispersibility
The selected SPIOs (S1, S2,
S3, and S8) are characterized by FTIR,
TEM, XRD, and DLS to investigate their structure, morphology, and
dispersibility in the carrier liquid.

3.2.1 FTIR
Figure 1C(i–iv)
depicts the FTIR spectra of
14DAB-, 4ABA-, 34DABA-, and 4ABA-TA coated SPIOs (i.e., S1, S2, S3,
and S8), respectively. The absorption peaks of 584–586 cm–1 correspond to the Fe–O stretching vibrations
of the iron oxide core in each of the SPIOs, and the absorption peaks
beyond 600 cm–1 are ascribed to the vibrations from
the coatings adsorbed to the surface of the SPIOs. The absorption
peaks at the region of 1390–1600 cm–1 are
assigned to the symmetric/asymmetric vibrations of the amino groups
of 14DAB, 4ABA, and 34DABA molecules attached to the surface of the
SPIOs. Moreover, the broad absorption peaks at 3100–3400 cm–1 in Figure 1C(ii–iv) correspond to the O–H bonds of the
carboxylic functional groups of 4ABA, 34DABA, and TA molecules attached
to the respective SPIOs. Thus, the presence of 14DAB, 4ABA, 34DABA,
and 4ABA-TA coating molecules attached to the surface of the SPIOs
is confirmed.

3.2.2 TEM and XRD
Figure 2A(i–iv)
displays the TEM images of
the 14DAB-, 4ABA-, 34DABA-, and 4ABA-TA-coated SPIOs (S1, S2, S3,
and S8), respectively, where the average particle sizes are calculated
via a software (Image J) by considering ∼30–40 number
of nanoparticles. The average particle sizes of S1, S2, S3, and S8
are determined as 6 ± 2, 8 ± 2, 10 ± 2, and 8 ±
3 nm, respectively (refer Table 1), which indicates that the sizes of as-synthesized
nanoparticles are within superparamagnetic regime (<20 nm). Moreover,
the shapes of all of the SPIOs (i.e., S1–S3 and S8) are found
to be spherical.

including (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440), confirm the Fe3O4 (magnetite) phase with inverse spinel structure
(JCPDS file, 19-0629). Moreover, the inset in Figure 2B displays the selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern for S3, which also clearly shows the diffraction rings
corresponding to the lattice planes of (220), (311), (400), (511),
and (440) to agree with the XRD result. Similar XRD/SAED patterns
can be obtained for other three samples as well. In addition, the
crystallite size (D) for S3 is calculated to be 9.78
nm by using the Scherrer formula (which is D = Kλ/(β cos θ), where K is a constant, λ is the wavelength of X-ray, and
β is the peak width of half-maximum) on consideration of (311)
diffraction peak.

the hydrodynamic size
(Dh) distribution plots of the 4DAB-,
4ABA-, 34DABA-, and 4ABA-TA-coated SPIOs (S1, S2, S3, and S8) dispersed
in water-based ferrofluids (AFF-1, AFF-2, AFF-3, and AFF-4), respectively.
The mean Dh values are determined as 163.3,
137.1, 193.5, and 149.3 nm for the S1, S2, S3, and S8 samples, respectively
(refer Table 1). It
can be seen that the Dh of the SPIOs is
larger than their TEM sizes, which is mainly attributed to the formation
of small clusters/aggregates and linear chains/loops of the SPIOs
in the ferrofluid suspension due to (i) magnetic dipole–dipole/interparticle
interactions and/or (ii) hydrogen bonding between the nearby surface-attached
functional groups.28Figure 3B(i–iv) displays the ζ-potential
(ζ) plots of the 4DAB-, 4ABA-, 34DABA-, and 4ABA-TA-coated SPIOs
(S1, S2, S3, and S8) dispersed in water-based ferrofluids (AFF-1,
AFF-2, AFF-3, and AFF-4), and the corresponding mean ζ-potentials
are determined as −31, −43, −33, and −31
mV, respectively (refer Table 1). These results confirm that the SPIOs have very good water
dispersibility because generally the nanoparticles are considered
to be stable in suspensions if their ζ potentials are near/above
±30 mV.29

Thus, on the basis of the TGA/VSM/FTIR/TEM/XRD/DLS
results, 4DAB-,
4ABA-, 34DABA-, and 4ABA-TA-coated SPIOs (S1, S2, S3, and S8) dispersed
in the aqueous ferrofluids (AFFs) are selected for further MFH studies.

3.3 Calorimetric MFH
Calorimetric MFH
(C-MFH) experiments of the 4DAB-, 4ABA-, 34DABA-, and 4ABA-TA-coated
SPIO (S1, S2, S3, and S8)-based AFFs (AFF-1, AFF-2, AFF-3, and AFF-4,
respectively) are performed at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to
8 mg mL–1 on exposure to the AMF with a specific
amplitude and frequency. Herein, the heat generated by the SPIOs is
mainly due to the following: (i) Néel relaxation mechanism
(rotation of magnetic moments) and (ii) Brownian relaxation mechanism
(physical rotation of the particles). The time periods taken by AFFs
to reach the fixed/maximum temperature (≤45 °C) within
the stipulated time of 30 min and their corresponding heating efficacies
(SAR values) are given in Table S3. The
effects of the fundamental parameters, including concentrations, surface
coatings, applied alternating magnetic fields (AMFs), and dispersion
media, on the heating efficiencies of the SPIOs/AFFs are discussed
subsequently.

3.3.1 Effects of Concentrations and Surface Coatings
Initially, AFFs are exposed to AMF with an amplitude (H) of 10.9 kA m–1 at a frequency (f) of 751.5 kHz (H × f ∼
8.2 GAm–1 s–1) to study the effects
of concentrations/surface coatings on their heating efficiencies. Figure 4i–iv depicts
the time-dependent temperature (TDT) curves for AFF-1–AFF-4,
respectively. It can be seen that the time taken by the AFFs to reach
the fixed/maximum temperature (≤45 °C) is significantly
decreased with the increment in their concentrations (refer Table S3). For instance, AFF-1 has reached 45
°C in 29.3, 20.1, 5.1, and 1.9 min for 1, 2, 4, and 8 mg mL–1 concentrations, respectively. Likewise, AFF-2 has
taken 13.9, 6.2, and 3.5 min to reach 45 °C at 2, 4, and 8 mg
mL–1 concentrations, respectively. A similar trend
in time reduction with the increase of concentrations to reach the
fixed/maximum temperature is observed for AFF-3 and AFF-4 as well.
Nevertheless, AFF-3 has taken shorter time periods as compared with
AFF-1, AFF-2, and AFF-4 to reach a fixed/maximum temperature for all
of the concentrations. The faster heating profile of AFF-3 could be
mainly ascribed to the larger particle size (i.e., 10 nm), high saturation
magnetization (i.e., 71.3 emu g–1), and enhanced
relaxations (because of the formation of comparably large clusters/aggregates
of the SPIOs (S3), as evident from their DLS result) in association
with higher motion/rotation (of the nanoparticles in aqueous medium)
driven by the applied magnetic field.30,31

AFF-1 (14DAB-coated SPIOs), (ii) AFF-2 (4ABA-coated SPIOs), (iii)
AFF-3 (34DABA-coated SPIOs), and (iv) AFF-4 (4ABA-TA-coated SPIOs).
Inset in (iii) represents the TDT curve of water (without SPIOs) on
exposure to AMF with an H × f value of 8.2 GAm–1 s–1.

Moreover, AFF-3 has reached the
therapeutic temperature of 42 °C
at the lowest concentration (0.5 mg mL–1) as compared
with AFF-1, AFF-2, and AFF-4 (42 °C, not reached) within the
stipulated time of 30 min. Furthermore, AFF-3 has shown the highest
SAR (calculated as per eq 1) values (330.8 and 207.3 W gFe–1),
as compared with the SAR values of AFF-1 (302.3 and 176.6 W gFe–1), AFF-2 (219.4 and 83.3 W gFe–1), and AFF-4 (287.2 and 41.9 W gFe–1) at lower concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mg mL–1, respectively. Thus, on the basis of the faster heating
profiles and higher SAR values, AFF-3 has been chosen for further
studies.

3.3.2 Effects of Applied Alternating
Magnetic
Fields (AMFs)
To study the effects of applied magnetic fields,
AFF-3 (at 0.5–8 mg mL–1 concentrations) has
been exposed to AMFs with the amplitudes (H) and
frequencies (f) in the range of 7.1–15.39
kA m–1 and 175.2–1001.1 kHz, respectively
(with H × f values ranging
from 2.44 to 9.99 GAm–1 s–1, refer Table 2). The time taken
by AFF-3 to reach the fixed/maximum temperature (≤45 °C)
within the stipulated time of 30 min for the applied AMFs is correspondingly
given in Table S3. It can be seen that
the required time is reduced considerably with the increment of the
AMFs (in terms of H × f values)
to reach fixed/maximum temperature (≤45 °C). For instance,
the time taken by AFF-3 (at 8 mg mL–1 concentration)
to reach 45 °C is reduced from 15.4 to 2.3 min with the increase
in H × f values from 2.4 to
9.9 GAm–1 s–1. A similar reduction
in time can be observed with the increase in H × f values for the other concentrations (i.e., 4, 2, 1, and
0.5 mg mL–1) as well. Thus, the applied AMFs have
a major influence in the heating rates of the SPIOs.

Furthermore, the calculated SAR values of AFF-3 for
all of the
applied AMFs are given in Table 2. It can be seen that the SAR values are decreased
with the increase in the concentrations (i.e., from 0.5 to 8 mg mL–1 concentration) in each of the applied magnetic fields.
For instance, the SAR value has decreased from 165.8 to 32.3 with
the increment in concentrations (from 0.5 to 8 mg mL–1) for the H × f of 4.4 GAm–1 s–1. A similar decreasing trend
is observed for the other H × f values as well, which could be mainly ascribed to more agglomerations
at higher concentrations due to increased interparticle interactions
between the SPIOs, which might have led to the formation of very long
linear-chain structures inside the aqueous suspensions and subsequent
reductions in their Brownian relaxations.32−35

Moreover, it can be noted
that the SAR values are increasing with
the increase in the applied magnetic field (H × f value) in each of the concentrations of the AFF-3. For
instance, at 0.5 mg mL–1 concentration of AFF-3
the following holds true: (i) if H × f < Hergt’s limit (i.e., 5 GAm–1 s–1), the SAR values are estimated to be 48.6,
82.1, 100.5, 140.7, and 165.8 W gFe–1 for the corresponding H × f values of 2.4, 3.4, 3.6, 4.1, and 4.4 GAm–1 s–1, respectively, and (ii) if H × f > Hergt’s limit, the SAR values are estimated
to
be 189.3, 330.8, and 432.1 W gFe–1 for
the corresponding H × f values
of 8, 8.2, and 9.9 GAm–1 s–1 (calculated
on the basis of the average of three readings to maintain repeatability/consistency
at this concentration), respectively. Figure 5i shows the linear increasing trend in SAR
values with the increment in H × f values (at 0.5 mg mL–1 concentration of AFF-3),
which is in good correlation with the reported literature.36 The obtained SAR values of AFF-3 are higher
than many already-reported SPIO-based AFFs (having similar physicochemical/magnetic
properties) that are functionalized with short-chained and σ-conjugated
surfactants. For instance, the SPIO-based AFFs that are coated with
sodium oleate,37 citric acid/albumin,38 glycyrrhizic acid,39 glycine,40 and pentenoic acid41 have exhibited respective SAR values of 14,
16.7, 17.9, 77.6, and 110.6 W gFe–1 (which
are lower than those values of AFF-3). In addition, AFF-3 (34DABA-coated
SPIOs) has shown improved heating efficiency (or high SAR values)
as compared to our previously reported AFFs that are prepared from
the SPIOs having only carboxyl-based end groups.18 The better heating efficiency of AFF-3 could be due to
larger particle size and higher magnetic response of the SPIOs core
to the applied AMFs via (i) enhanced π–π conjugation
paths of the surface-attached 34DABA coating molecules due to the
intrafunctional group attractions from their close structural orientation
(refer Scheme 1C(i))
(ii) improved anisotropy due to the formation of clusters/linear chains/loops
of the SPIOs in the ferrofluids suspension due to the interfunctional
group attractions (i.e., −NH2 and −COOH groups,
refer Scheme 1C(ii))
and interparticle (i.e., particle–particle) interactions among
different SPIOs (refer Scheme 1C(iii)) and their parallel alignment to the applied AMF.35,42,43

AFF-3 (34DABA-coated SPIOs) at 0.5 mg mL–1 concentration.
(ii) ILP values vs H × f for
AFF-3 (34DABA-coated SPIOs) at 0.5 mg mL–1 concentration,
where the blue line with arrow indicates Hergt’s safety limit
of 5 GAm–1 s–1.

In addition, the ILP values (normalized SAR) of
AFF-3 are calculated
as per eq 2 for all of
the concentrations for all H × f values (refer Table 2). The highest ILP value of 5.2 nHm2 kg–1 is observed at 0.5 mg mL–1 concentration and H × f = 4.4 × 109 GAm–1 s–1 (i.e., below the Hergt’s
limit, refer Figure 5ii), which is larger than several commercially available SPIO-based
FFs, for instance, 0.16, 0.17, 0.35, 1.71, and 2.31 nHm2 kg–1 for BNF-0208, BNF-01808, BNF-01908, Fluidmag,
and nanomag-D-spio, respectively.44

3.3.3 Effects of Dispersion Media
The
dispersion media of the SPIO-based FFs might also have significant
roles in influencing their heating responses by modifying the Néel/Brownian
relaxation mechanisms. The heat generating effects of the SPIOs are
studied in different biological/nonbiological carrier liquids (refer Figure 6A for nonbiological
ferrofluids (NBFFs)/biological ferrofluids (BFFs)). Table 3 shows the heating efficacies
(SAR/ILP values) of the NBFFs/BFFs at 0.5 mg mL–1 concentration with an applied AMF (H × f = 8.2 GAm–1 s–1),
which is then compared by plotting their SAR values in Figure 6B.

Figure 6 (A) 34DABA-coated SPIOs
are dispersed in EG, DEG, TEG, GC, PBS,
DMEM, DMEM + 5% FBS, and FBS with corresponding markings of NBFF-1,
NBFF-2, NBFF-3, NBFF-4, BFF-1, BFF-2, BFF-3, and BFF-4. (B) SAR values

BFF-3	DMEM + 5% FBS	370.6	288.9	3.2	
BFF-4	FBS	226.9	336.9	3.7	
It can
be seen that all of the NBFFs have reached the therapeutic
temperature (42–45 °C) similar to their aqueous counterpart
(AFF-3) at 0.5 mg mL–1 concentration within the
stipulated time of 30 min. The SAR value is gradually increased from
330.8 W gFe–1 (AFF-3) to 372.6/430.1
W gFe–1 (NBFF-1/NBFF-2), reaching to
a maximum value of 440.4 W gFe–1 (NBFF-3)
and then decreasing to 266.9 W gFe–1 (NBFF-4),
which is in good correlation with the results already reported in
the literature.45,46 The increment in the SAR values
from NBFF-1 to NBFF-3 could be due to the increment of density of
the carrier media of the NBFFs (refer Table 3). Besides, this increment could be associated
with the slight aggregation of the SPIOs in the corresponding carrier
liquids, as evident from the increment in their hydrodynamic sizes
(refer Table 3). However,
the SAR value is decreased for the NBFF-4 (regardless of its highest
hydrodynamic size among all of the NBFFs), which could be mainly ascribed
to the considerable reduction in its relaxation mechanisms due to
near immobilization of the SPIOs in the highly viscous carrier liquid.

On the other hand, the SAR value is gradually decreased from 321
W gFe–1 (BFF-1) to 307 W gFe–1 (BFF-2), reaching to a minimum value of 288.9
W gFe–1 (BFF-3), and then increased to
336.9 W gFe–1 (BFF-4). The decrement
in the SAR values from BFF-1 to BFF-3 could be due to the large aggregation
of the SPIOs in the respective biological media, as apparent from
the large increment in their hydrodynamic sizes (refer Table 3), attributed to the complex
interactions between the surface-functional groups of the SPIOs and
the carrier liquid molecules (glucose, phosphate, etc.).47−52 But the BFF-4 exhibited the highest SAR value among all of the BFFs,
which could be due to its lowest hydrodynamic size (refer Table 3).

In conclusion,
the surface coatings, concentrations, applied alternating
magnetic fields, and dispersion media have significant impacts on
the heating efficiencies of the SPIOs/AFFs.

3.4 Biological Studies
3.4.1 In Vitro Cell Viability
In vitro
cell viability of the 34DABA-coated SPIOs (S3/AFF-3) is determined
in the HepG2 liver cancer cells via trypan blue assay by considering
two incubation time periods (24/48 h) using the concentrations ranging
from 5–25 μgFe per well. The cytotoxicity
results of the SPIOs are plotted against the control cells (i.e.,
without SPIOs), where the cell viability is considered as 100% (refer Figure 7). It can be noted
that the HepG2 cells, treated with the SPIOs in all concentrations,
display excellent viability at both 24 and 48 h incubation periods.
Thus, the cell viability results indicate that the SPIOs are very
biocompatible with the HepG2 cells. Besides, no morphological changes
in HepG2 cancer cells are observed after 24 and 48 h incubation with
S3 (at concentrations of 5–25 μgFe per well),
refer Figure 3A(i–vi)
and B(i–vi), respectively.

Figure 7 Cell viability plot of the SPIOs (34DABA-coated
S3) at different
concentrations (5–25 μgFe per well) determined
via trypan blue assay after 24 and 48 h incubation with HepG2 liver
cancer cells. Label C indicates the control cells (i.e., without SPIOs).

3.4.2 In
Vitro MFH and WCTT
Herein, the
killing efficiency of the 34DABA-coated SPIOs (S3) in HepG2 cancer
cells via MFH (at 42 °C) is determined and compared to that of
the cells without MFH; i.e., the cells are treated with only AMF,
water bath, and SPIOs. No considerable death (as per Figure 8A) is observed for the HepG2
cells that are treated with only magnetic field (i.e., AMF) and water-bath-based
thermotherapy (i.e., WCTT), as compared with the control, and moreover,
no morphological changes are observed; refer Figure 8B(i–iii). However, the HepG2 cells
that are treated with only S3 (i.e., without exposing to AMF) at 0.5
and 1 mg mL–1 concentrations have exhibited very
negligible cell death percentages, i.e., 2 and 8%, respectively (as
per Figure 8A), and
no considerable morphological changes are observed (refer Figure 8B(iv),(v)). But S3
has induced ∼61 and ∼88% cell death at 0.5 and 1 mg
mL–1 concentrations, respectively (as per Figure 8A) and considerable
morphological changes in cells are observed after MFH treatment at
0.5 and 1 mg mL–1 concentrations, indicated in black
arrows in Figure 8B(vi),(vii),
respectively. This indicates that S3 is capable of inducing high cancer
cell death via MFH at 0.5/1 mg mL–1 (lower) concentrations,
which could be ascribed to its better heating responses under the
applied AMF, as discussed in previous sections.

Figure 8 (A) Cell viability plot
depicts the cytotoxic effect on HepG2 cancer
cells treated with MFH (∼42 °C) by using the SPIOs (34DABA-coated-S3)
at 0.5 and 1 mg mL–1 concentration on exposure to
AMF (with H × f value of 8.2
GAm–1 s–1) as compared to control,
cells treated with magnetic field only (i.e., without SPIOs), cells
treated with water-bath only (i.e., without AMF and SPIOs), and cells
incubated with SPIOs only (at 0.5 and 1 mg mL–1 concentrations,
without AMF/water bath). (B) Comparison of optical microscopic images
(taken at 20× (i.e., 100 μm) magnification) of HepG2 liver
cancer cells (i) control, (ii) cells treated with magnetic field only
(i.e., without SPIOs), (iii) cells treated with water-bath only (i.e.,
without AMF and SPIOs), (iv, v) cells incubated with SPIOs only (i.e.,
without AMF/water bath) at 0.5 and 1 mg mL–1 concentrations,
respectively, and (vi, vii) cells treated with MFH by using SPIOs
at 0.5 and 1 mg mL–1 concentrations, respectively.

3.4.3 In
Vitro Uptake
In vitro uptake
of SPIOs (i.e., intracellular Fe ions) is qualitatively confirmed
via the Prussian blue staining method. It can be noted from the microscopic
images in Figure 9i,ii
that the control cells (without and with AMF, respectively) have not
displayed any blue staining. Moreover, the cells have displayed the
blue staining when they are incubated with 34DABA-coated SPIOs (S3
at 15 μgFe) for 24 and 48 h (refer Figure 9iii,iv) during the cytotoxicity
measurements. In addition, the HepG2 cells after the MFH (i.e., treated
with SPIOs + AMF at 0.5 and 1 mg mL–1 concentrations,
refer Figure 9vii,viii,
respectively) have shown relatively higher staining as compared with
the cells that are treated with only SPIOs (i.e., no exposure to AMF,
at 0.5 and 1 mg mL–1 concentration, refer Figure 9v,vi, respectively).
This indicates that the SPIOs are effectively uptaken by the HepG2
cells even at shorter time periods (during 1 h MFH treatment), resulting
in higher percentages of the cancer cell death.

Figure 9 Comparison of optical
microscopic images (taken at 20× (i.e.,
100 μm) magnification) of HepG2 liver cancer cells after Prussian
Blue staining: (i) control, (ii) cells treated with magnetic field
only (i.e., without SPIOs), (iii, iv) cells incubated with SPIOs at
15 μgFe per well after 24 and 48 h incubation, respectively,
(v, vi) cells incubated with SPIOs at 0.5 and 1 mg mL–1 concentrations, respectively, and (vii, viii) cells treated with
MFH by using SPIOs at 0.5 and 1 mg mL–1 concentrations,
respectively.

On the basis of the
above biological results, it can be concluded
that 34DABA-coated SPIOs are very efficient for in vitro MFH and thus
could be used for cancer thermotherapies.

4 Conclusions
To summarize, we have successfully synthesized
hydrophilic and
functionalized SPIOs via one-pot facile co-precipitation/thermolysis
methods using single surfactants (14DAB/4ABA/34DABA) and dual surfactants
(combined with TA/ATA/TMA/PMA). The as-synthesized SPIOs are characterized
for their physicochemical/magnetic/dispersibility properties. Although
all of the SPIOs have exhibited superparamagnetic behavior, only 14DAB-,
4ABA-, 34DABA-, and 4ABA-TA-coated SPIOs (S1, S2, S3, and S8 samples)
have shown high magnetization values (Ms = 55–71 emu g–1). Besides, these SPIOs
are found to be spherical in shape with their TEM and DLS sizes in
the range of 6–10 nm and 137–193 nm, respectively. In
addition, they have displayed good water dispersibility with high
ζ-potential values (−31 to −43 mV). In calorimetric
MFH (C-MFH) studies, the aqueous ferrofluids (AFF-1–AFF-4)
have displayed excellent time-dependent temperature rise under the
application of external magnetic fields. The AFF-3 (i.e., 34DABA-coated
SPIOs) has revealed faster thermal response to the AMF and reached
the therapeutic temperature even at the lowest concentration (0.5
mg mL–1) as compared to AFF-1, AFF-2, and AFF-4.
Moreover, AFF-3 has exhibited high heating efficacies with SAR and
ILP values of 48–432 W gFe–1 and
0.6–5.2 nHm2 kg–1, respectively,
with the AMF frequencies ranging from 175 to 1001 kHz. Besides, the
high viscous TEG-based ferrofluids (NBFF-3, with 34DABA-coated SPIOs)
exhibited the highest SAR value (440.4 W gFe–1) and also reached therapeutic temperatures at a faster rate as compared
to their counterparts in other biological and nonbiological media.
Moreover, the 34DABA-coated SPIOs have (i) demonstrated very good
cytocompatibility (without MFH) and (ii) achieved higher killing efficiency
of ∼61 and ∼88% (with MFH) in a concentration-dependent
manner (i.e., for 0.5 and 1 mg mL–1, respectively)
in HepG2 cancer cells as compared with their treatment with only magnetic
field/SPIOs and water-bath-based conventional thermotherapy (i.e.,
without SPIOs/MFH). Besides, the incubated 34DABA-coated SPIOs are
effectively internalized by the HepG2 liver cancer cells during cytotoxicity
and in vitro MFH experiments, as confirmed via Prussian blue staining.
Hence, the as-synthesized 34DABA-coated SPIOs are very promising heat-inducing
agents for the MFH and could be efficiently used as nanomedicines
for the cancer thermotherapy.
