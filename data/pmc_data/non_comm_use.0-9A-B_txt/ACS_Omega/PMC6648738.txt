The present article
deals with an one-to-one structure–property
correspondence of a dinuclear iron complex, [Dipic(H2O)FeOH]2·H2O (1) (Dipic = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic
acid). Variable-temperature X-ray single-crystal structural analysis
confirms a phase transition of complex 1 to complex 2 ([Dipic(H2O)FeOH]2) at 120 °C.
Further, single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) transformation was
monitored by temperature-dependent single crystal X-ray diffraction,
powder X-ray diffraction, time-dependent Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. SCSC transformation
brings the change in space group of single crystal. Complex 1 crystallizes in the C2/c space group, whereas complex 2 crystallizes in the Pi̅ space group. SCSC transformation brings the change
in packing diagram as well. Complex 1 shows two-dimensional
network through H-bonding, whereas the packing diagram of complex 2 shows a zigzag-like arrangement. Phase transformation not
only fetches structural changes but also in the magnetic properties.
Difference in Fe–O–Fe bond angles of two complexes creates
notable variation in their antiferromagnetic interactions with adjacent
metal centers.

Introduction
Single-crystal-to-single-crystal
(SCSC) transformation of coordination
complex with irretrievable changes of properties may lead to the development
of innovative materials.1−3 This is particularly true for
magnetic materials as subtle modification in the metal–ligand
environment can have a profound impact on their superexchange pathway,
the all-important mode of magnetic interaction.2,4 Such
tuning of magnetic interaction needs to ensure that structural integrity
remains intact after SCSC transformation. Most of the SCSC transitions
are induced by light, heat, and guest removal, especially solvents,
which often lead to collapse of the compound. Key to a successful
maneuvering of magnetic properties via SCSC transformation therefore
lies in retaining the structural integrity of the system.5,6 On the other hand, tuning the magnetic properties sensitive to guest
molecule is attracting interest because of their various potential
applications such as magnetic sponge7−9switches, sensors, etc.10,11Notwithstanding, only a limited number of SCSC transformations without
changing the coordination sphere of the metal center are known in
the literature.11−17 Although, most of these compounds showed spin crossover behavior.
To successfully implement of SCSC transformation, appropriate ligands
must be used. Among the vast variety of organic ligands that can be
used for SCFs, dicarboxylates are good candidates having potential
donor sites. Symmetrical pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (Dipic) having
five potential donor atoms can have various coordination modes,15 especially with iron metal ion due to strong
Fe–O bond.18,19 Although Fe–Dipic complex
is known for many years, their structural and magnetic properties
are still not clearly understood. Here, we report a structure of complex 1 having formula, [Dipic(H2O)FeOH]2·H2O, which, upon heating at 120 °C, transformed to complex 2 having formula [Dipic(H2O)FeOH]2.20 This structural transformation was induced by
removal of lattice water molecules, while temperature acts as an external
stimulus. Transformation also brings the change in bond distance and
bond angle. The Fe–O–Fe bond angle, which is a crucial
parameter of magnetic exchange, was also changed. As a consequence,
magnetic studies display their difference in magnetic interactions,
revealing from the coupling constant (J). Complex 1 shows a J value of −13.2 cm–1, and complex 2 shows a J value of −16.2 cm–1.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
Complex 1 was synthesized by
the layering technique using Fe(ClO4)2·xH2O and Dipic in H2O/MeOH solvent
mixture. Using different anions of Fe(II) salts as well as different
Fe(III) salts, complex 1 was also formed. Complex 2 was formed by heating complex 1 at ∼120
°C for few hours.

Structural Description
The crystallographic
parameters
of both the complexes are compared in Table 1. Complex 1 crystallizes in
the C2/c space group, whereas complex 2 crystallizes in the Pi̅ space group
(Figure 1). Both the
complexes contain two Dipic, two Fe(III) ions, two coordinated water,
and two μ-OH–. In addition, complex 1 has one H2O molecule as solvent (Figure 2). Each Fe(III) center of both
the complexes has distorted octahedral geometry having N1O5 coordination.

Each Fe(III) center
is coordinated by two O atoms of two carboxylate
groups, two −OH groups, and one H2O and N atom of
the pyridine ring. Two Fe(III) ions are bridged by two μ-OH
groups and form a diamond-shaped four-membered ring. An inversion
center passes through the center of the ring. Polyhedral views of
both the complexes are shown in Figure 3. Adjacent polyhedra are connected through edge sharing.
Differences in the bond distances of the two complexes are compared
in Figure 3. Fe–O–Fe
bond angles are 102.2 and 103.9° for complexes 1 and 2, respectively. The Fe–Fe bond distance
is 3.065(3) Å for complex 1 and 3.095(1) Å
for complex 2. The Fe–O bond distance is in the
range of 1.97(6)–2.09(8) Å for complex 1 and
1.89(4)–2.07(4) Å for complex 2. The Fe–N
bond distance is 2.07(7) Å for complex 1 and 1.98(5)
Å for complex 2. There are several H-bonding interactions
in both the complexes (Figure 4). However, for complex 1, H-bonding is further
increased due to participation of H2O molecule. If we closely
see the dimeric unit of both the complexes, the distance between two
molecular units increases from complex 1 to complex 2 (Figure 5). Complex 1 has an intermolecular distance of 7.452
Å, which is increased to 8.795 Å for complex 2. So, the H2O molecule helps to bring two molecular units
more closely. Therefore, in the absence of H2O, the intermolecular
distance increases. Interestingly, an intermolecular distance of 7.452
Å is unit cell length “c” of complex 1 and an intermolecular distance of 8.795 Å is unit cell
length “c” of complex 2. Therefore, H-bonding is very crucial for change of unit cell parameters.
The packing diagram of complex 2 shows zigzag-like arrangement
(Figure 4b,c), whereas
for complex 1, the packing diagram is completely different
because of the difference in H-bonding. For complex 1, H2O molecules reside in between the dinuclear units
(Figure 4a). SCSC transformation
further affects the π–π interactions. In complex 1, the distance between two centroids of π–π
interaction is 3.621 Å, whereas after the transformation, phenyl
rings come closer and the distance between two centroid of π–π
interaction decreases to 3.456 Å (Figure 6).

Hirshfeld Surface Analysis
Hirshfeld surface analysis
was carried out to study the nature of intra- and intermolecular interactions
for difference in the packing diagram. Our focus here is on the O···H
and N···H interactions. The N–H···H
and O–H···H interactions are distinguished on
the basis of charge density. A large number of red zones in the dnorm of Hirshfeld surface area represent the
presence of significant short interactions for both the complexes,
and intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions of complexes 1 and 2 are shown in Figure 7a,d, respectively. Contributions of intermolecular
interactions of O···H and N···H to the
total Hirshfeld surface area are shown in Figure 7. The O···H interactions comprise
15.4% to the total Hirshfeld surface area in complex 1, whereas the percentage of O···H interactions increases
to 16.3% in complex 2. N···H interactions
comprise only 0.2% to the total Hirshfeld surface area in complexes 1 and 2, and N···H interactions
comprise 0.4%. Therefore, such difference in O···H
and N···H interactions of both the complexes significantly
affects the packing diagram and displays drastic changes in the packing.

and N···H interactions.

Temperature-Dependent Single-Crystal XRD Study
Although
two distinctly different forms were observed after heating at 120
°C, detailed variable-temperature diffraction studies were carried
out to probe this phase transition. Accordingly, X-ray diffraction
data for a single crystal were collected at 120, 170, 220, 270, and
320 K (Table 2). All
of these structures confirmed the retention of complex 1 form. Unfortunately, the crystal started developing a crack at ca.
370 K. At 370 K, the same cell (complex 1) was indexed,
but intensities were not good enough for structure elucidation. The
cracks get even bigger at 400 K, and it was not possible to index.
Notwithstanding, from this original crystal, we managed to separate
a small piece, suitable for diffraction. It was really gratifying
to note that the structure obtained from this piece of crystal is
indeed that of complex 2, and henceforth confirms the
SCSC transition or more precisely single-crystal-to-single-crystal
phase transition.

Temperature-Dependent Powder
X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) Study
To eliminate any ambiguity,
a variable-temperature PXRD study was
also carried out to monitor the phase transition of complex 1 to 2 (Figure 8). The PXRD patterns are highly corroborative to single-crystal
data. At room temperature, the experimental PXRD pattern of complex 1 matches well with the simulated pattern.

Figure 8 Simulated and temperature-dependent
experimental X-ray powder diffraction
patterns observed from the sample of complex 1.

Detailed investigation reveals
that as the temperature increased,
systematic changes appeared in the PXRD profile. Certain characteristic
peaks for complex 1 diminish and new peaks generate for
complex 2 at 130 °C. Three distinct peaks at 2θ
= 8.2, 8.8, and 18.8° of complex 1 vanished with
increasing temperature, whereas new peaks generated at 2θ =
10.8 and 12.3° at high temperature for the generation of complex 2. At 160 °C, the PXRD pattern of the heated sample of
complex 1 matches well with the simulated pattern of
complex 2. A slight discrepancy of peak at 29.3°
may originate from inhomogeneity of the size of crystalline materials.
So, from the temperature-dependent PXRD study, the transformation
of complex 1 to complex 2 upon heating is
clearly visible.

Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Study
To further
support the change of structural transformation of complex 1 to 2, temperature-dependent FT-IR study was carried
out. It is interesting to examine the change of O–H stretching
frequency of H2O molecule with temperature. Complex 1 has a broad O–H stretching frequency at ∼3487
cm–1 and bending of two doublets at 1643 and 1652
cm–1.

Conversely, complex 2 has
a broad O–H stretching frequency at ∼3413 cm–1 and bending of two doublets at 1620 and 1654 cm–1. Complex 1 was heated at the temperature of 120 °C
for 12 h and FT-IR spectra were measured. The FT-IR spectrum of the
heated sample well matched with that of complex 2 (Figure 9). Furthermore, complex 1 was heated at the temperature of 120 °C at different
time intervals. After 6 h, there is a change of spectrum, as O–H
stretching shifted from ∼3487 to 3413 cm–1 (Figure S1).

Figure 9 Comparison of FT-IR spectra
of complex 1, complex 1 after heating, and
complex 2.

DSC Study
Thermal analysis was carried out for complex 1 by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at the
rate of 5 °C/min. DSC measurements show one broad endothermic
peak for complex 1 at ∼157 °C corresponding
to a solid-to-solid phase transformation of complex 1 to 2. Similar SCSC transformation and removal of H2O molecules were also observed in the [Mn2(4-Apha)4(H2O)2]·2H2O22 complex, where a broad peak at 161 °C was
observed indicating the transformation. The cooling graph does not
show any peak suggesting that the transformation is irreversible (Figure 10). The ΔH value of ∼17.2 kJ mol–1 was calculated
from the DSC curve. If we consider removal of a H2O molecule,
it implies breaking of two H-bonds. Wendler et al. proposed that ΔH = 21.5 kJ mol–1 corresponds to breaking
of two H-bonds.23 So, the enthalpy is close
to the experimental value. A similar change in enthalpy was also observed
for the transformation of [Cu(PDC)(py)2C(OH)2)(H2O)] to [Cu(PDC)(py)2C(OH)2)].24 Further, DSC measurement was conducted at a
lower temperature of 2 °C and a sharp peak was observed at ∼159
°C due to phase transformation (Figure S2). Thus, from the DSC curve, we also observed the clear transformation
at 160 °C.

Figure 10 DSC thermogram of complex 1 at the rate of
5 °C/min.

Void Space Calculation
To investigate the number of
H2O molecules and void space in the system, PLATON25 software was used. No solvent-accessible void
space was found for both the complexes. Further, void space was calculated
for complex 1 after removing the H2O molecule
from unit cell, and there was a total void space of 92.4 Å3, where only hydrogen-bonded H2O can fit to occupy
∼40 Å3 space. Therefore, in complex 1, only one H2O molecule is present. After removing the
H2O molecule, the complex became unstable in the monoclinic
system because of the huge void space of 92.4 Å3 and
converted to triclinic system of complex 2.

DFT Calculation
The loss of one H2O molecule
from the hydrogen-bonded system of complex 1 was expected
to be compensated by means of structural rearrangement. Therefore,
to investigate the energy aspects of structural transformation, single-point
DFT calculations were performed using G09 program. Complex 2 was found to be stabilized by 24.89 kJ mol–1 relative
to complex 1 (Figure 11). The relative difference of ∼25 kJ mol–1 of energy is not sufficient to break covalent bonds
(BDE for C–C = 350 kJ mol–1); however, they
are sufficient to produce conformational change (ca. 2–3 kJ
mol–1) that is compensated by the loss of water
molecules.

Figure 11 Energy level diagram of complexes 1 and 2, calculated through single-point DFT calculation.

Magnetic Study
It is imperative to note here that the
SCSC phase transition brings a significant change in the bond distance
and angles related to the metals. Coincidentally, such change in bond
distance and angles can bring about a profound change in their magnetic
behavior. Naturally, we were interested in finding if the SCSC phase
transition has any consequential change in magnetic behavior.

For magnetic characterization, dc susceptibility data were collected
for complexes 1 and 2 on the polycrystalline
sample in the temperature range of 2–300 K at 0.1 T. The observed
room-temperature χMT (χM = molar magnetic susceptibility) values are 7.33 cm3 mol–1 K for complex 1 and 7.22 cm3 mol–1 K for complex 2. Both
the experimental χMT values are
slightly lower than the theoretical χMT value of 8.75 cm3 mol–1 K for two uncoupled
Fe3+ and g = 2 probably due to the presence
of antiferromagnetic interactions. With decreasing temperature, the
χMT value gradually decreased and
reached the minimum values of 0.02 and 0.23 cm3 mol–1 K for complexes 1 and 2, respectively, at 2 K (Figure 12). Decreasing the χMT value with temperature is most probably due to the antiferromagnetic
exchange between the adjacent Fe(III) centers. To study the magnetic
interactions in detail, dinuclear model (Figure 13) was taken and fitted using the Hamiltonian
(eq 1) and Van Vleck
(eq 2) equations. 1  [S = spin, J = intermolecular magnetic
interaction] 2  where P = 2e2x + 10e6x + 28e12x + 60e20x + 110e30x

and Q = 1 + 3e2x + 5e6x + 7e12x + 9e20x + 11e30x, x = J/kT. 3  where zJ′ denotes
intermolecular magnetic interactions.

Best fitting of the plot
resulted J = −13.2
cm–1 and g = 2.03 for complex 1 and J = −16.2 cm–1 and g = 2.03 for complex 2. The negative
values of J suggest antiferromagnetic interactions
between two Fe(III) ions of both the complexes. In general, if the
Fe–O–Fe angle is between ca. 93 and 98°, the interaction
is ferromagnetic, and antiferromagnetic above that range.26 For complex 1, the Fe–O–Fe
angle is 102.2°, and for complex 2, the Fe–O–Fe
angle is 103.9°. So, the antiferromagnetic interaction is expected
for both the complexes. However, because of the increase in the Fe–O–Fe
angle for complex 2 compared to that for complex 1, antiferromagnetic exchange is enhanced for complex 2.

The J values of both the complexes
are well comparable
to the reported similar structure complex having two Fe(III) centers
connected by μ-OH bridging, [Chel(H2O)FeOH]2·4H2O(chel = 4-hydroxo-2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate),
where J = −7.3 cm–1.20

Further, we consider intermolecular magnetic
interactions (zJ′) originated from various
weak interactions, and
the experimental χMT vs T plot was fitted using Van Vleck eqs 2 and 3(26) for both the complexes (Figure 14). From the best fitting, J = −12.3 cm–1, zJ′
= −0.98 cm–1, and g = 2.03
were obtained for complex 1. For complex 2, J = −15.4 cm–1, zJ′ = −1.1 cm–1, and g = 2.03 were obtained from the fitting. The negative zJ′ value indicates very weak antiferromagnetic interactions.
The values of zJ′ interactions are very low
for both the complexes due to very weak interactions.

Figure 14 Temperature-dependent
dc magnetic susceptibility of complexes 1 and 2. The solid lines indicate fitting of
the plots considering intermolecular interactions (zJ′).

Additionally, we have
calculated energy of spins by fitting the
χMT vs T plot using
the FITMART software27 considering isotropic
interactions in matrix diagonalization process. From the plot, it
has been observed that S = 0 is lowest in energy
for both 1 and 2 (Figures S3 and S4). Therefore, ground-state spin of both the complexes
are zero. Although, the difference in absolute energy values for the
two complexes originate most probably due to difference in magnetic
exchange.

Isothermal magnetization plots of complexes 1 and 2 at 2 K are shown in Figure S5. Both the complexes do not show any saturation even
at the highest
field of 7 T at 2 K due to the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions.
Complex 1 shows maximum value of 0.06 Nβ, and complex 2 shows the maximum value of 0.061 Nβ at the field of
7 T. Both the values correspond to zero net spin.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully transformed one single crystal
to another single crystal through solvent removal applying external
heat as stimulus. PXRD, DSC, and FT-IR studies clearly reveal the
transformation. The change in crystal structure by phase transition
has a direct effect on magnetism, which was explained in terms of
the magnetic exchanges of complexes 1 and 2. DFT calculation further endorses the SCSC transformation. Temperature-induced
SCSC transition of similar systems is currently underway.

Experimental
Section
Instrument
Infrared spectra were recorded in the solid
state (KBr pellets) on a PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrometer in the range
of 400–4000 cm–1. Temperature-dependent FT-IR
spectra were recorded using same pellet initially and after heating
for 12 h at 120 °C. Additionally, FT-IR spectra were also recorded
using new pellet after heating the sample for 12 h at 120 °C.
The powder XRD patterns were obtained from a Rigaku instrument with
Cu Kα anode, and measurements were done for the 2θ range
of 5–50° with the scan rate of 0.025° s–1. Variable-temperature PXRD data were recorded in aerobic condition.
Variable-temperature direct current (dc) magnetic susceptibility data
were collected on a quantum design MPMS SQUID VSM magnetometer equipped
with a 0.1 T dc magnet and in the 2–300 K range. The measured
values were corrected for the experimentally measured contribution
of the sample holder, while the derived susceptibilities were corrected
for the diamagnetism of the samples, estimated from Pascal’s
tables.26

(λ = 0.71073) radiation. Data collections were performed using
φ and ω scans. Data reduction and cell refinements were
performed with the SAINT program,28 and
the absorption correction program SADABS29 was employed to correct the data for absorption effects. The structure
was solved using direct methods followed by full-matrix least-square
refinements against F2 (all data are in
HKLF 4 format) using SHELXL-14.30 Anisotropic
refinement was used for all nonhydrogen atoms. Organic hydrogen atoms
were placed in appropriate calculated positions. Variable-temperature
single-crystal X-ray crystallographic data were collected on Agilent
Technologies, Gemini S Ultra kappa-diffractometer. Refinements were
done using SHELXL-15.30 Short descriptions
of crystal data are summarized in Table 1. X-ray crystallographic data in CIF format
are available in CCDC 1866848–1866854.

DFT Calculation
All theoretical calculations were performed
using the Gaussian 09 program.31 DFT calculation
employed the B3LYP functional using all electron basis sets. The geometry
was fully optimized without symmetry constraints. All of the atoms
are treated with double-ζ quality (DZVP) basis sets of 6-31G*
quality.32 Mulliken atomic charges of complexes 1 and 2 are given in Tables S1 and S2.

Synthesis
All of the chemicals and
solvents were purchased
from commercially available source and used without further purification.

Synthesis of [Dipic(H2O)FeOH]2· H2O (1)
Complex 1 was synthesized
using the layering technique. A buffer layer of a 5 mL solution of
H2O/MeOH (1:1) was carefully layered over an aqueous solution
(10 mL) of Fe(ClO4)2·xH2O (0.1 mmol). Then, a methanol/water (10:1) solution
(5 mL) of the H2Dipic (16.7 mg, 0.1 mmol) and NEt3 (10.1 mg, 0.1 mmol) was carefully layered on top of the buffer layer.
Orange-colored large single crystals were grown at the junction of
the layers. All of the crystals were separated and washed with cold
MeOH. Elemental analysis: (C14H14Fe2N2O13): Calculated: C, 31.73; H, 2.66; N, 5.29.
Found: C, 31.29; H, 2.54; N, 5.03.
