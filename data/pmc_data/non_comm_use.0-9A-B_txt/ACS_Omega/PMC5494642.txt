The
relative ease of Mössbauer spectroscopy and of density
functional theory (DFT) calculations encourages the use of Mössbauer
parameters as a validation method for calculations, and the use of
calculations as a double check on crystallographic structures. A number
of studies have proposed correlations between the computationally
determined electron density at the iron nucleus and the observed isomer
shift, but deviations from these correlations in low-valent iron β-diketiminate
complexes encouraged us to determine a new correlation for these compounds.
The use of B3LYP/def2-TZVP in the ORCA platform provides an excellent
balance of accuracy and speed. We provide here not only this new correlation
and a clear guide to its use but also a systematic analysis of the
limitations of this approach. We also highlight the impact of crystallographic
inaccuracies, DFT model truncation, and spin states, with intent to
assist experimentalists to use Mössbauer spectroscopy and calculations
together.

Introduction
Since
the discovery of recoilless nuclear resonance absorption
of γ-rays in 1957 by Rudolf Mössbauer,1 the spectroscopy bearing his name has become a powerful
technique in transition metal and bioinorganic chemistry to obtain
information regarding the electronics and magnetic properties of metal
centers.2 The Mössbauer effect has
been observed for more than 80 nuclides, but 57Fe Mössbauer
spectroscopy is the most common.3−6 Mössbauer spectroscopy using the 57Fe nucleus has become ubiquitous in both bioinorganic and coordination
chemistry because of the ability to selectively probe Fe environments
in a sample, even in the presence of large protein scaffolds or complex
ligands that have numerous other atoms.5 Each unique iron environment typically exhibits a doublet in a Mössbauer
spectrum when the applied field is small (“zero field”)
(Figure 1). Fitting
the zero-field doublet yields two parameters, the isomer shift (δ)
and the absolute value of the quadrupole splitting (|ΔEQ|).3

Figure 1 Diagram of a typical
zero-field Mössbauer spectrum with
isomer shift (δ) and quadrupole splitting parameters (|ΔEQ|) indicated.

The isomer shift, δ, which lies at the midpoint of
the doublet,
reflects the electron density at the iron nucleus and is often used
to interpret the oxidation state and spin state of the iron center.
For example, high oxidation states tend to give lower isomer shifts
in high-spin compounds, and for the same oxidation state, low-spin
compounds tend to give lower isomer shifts than high-spin compounds.3 However, the ligand field has a substantial influence
on the isomer shift, and additional trends are evident based on the
ligand identities (more covalency tends to give lower δ) and
the geometry at the metal (lower coordination numbers tend to give
lower δ). These trends have been usefully summed up by the generalization
that shorter bonds give lower δ, a principle that unites the
trends with oxidation state, coordination number, and spin state.3 However, due to the number of (often competing)
influences, it may be difficult to predict the isomer shift adequately
with these qualitative relationships.

The quadrupole splitting,
which represents the peak-to-peak separation
of the doublet, reflects the asymmetry in electron distribution around
the nucleus and therefore can offer insight into the occupancy of
the 3d orbitals. For high-symmetry iron centers with octahedral and
tetrahedral coordination environments, interpretation of the quadrupole
splitting can be straightforward, but in more complex systems with
less symmetry and orbital mixing, interpretation is typically more
complicated.3

The complexity of interpreting
the spectral values for understanding
of electronics and bonding has led chemists to use density functional
theory (DFT) computations to predict Mössbauer parameters for
a given structure.6,7 The ability to accurately calculate
the experimental values has also become a valuable way to validate
a computational model.7,8 Computation of the isomer shift
and quadrupole splitting for an iron site requires calculation of
the electron density and the electric field gradient (EFG) at the
iron nucleus, respectively. Calculating the isomer shift is problematic
because of systematic errors of common basis sets in describing the
electron density very close to the iron nucleus. As a result, calculation
of isomer shift values generally depends on an empirically determined
correlation between the calculated electron density and the experimental
isomer shift.6,9 These fits are typically linear,
but the fit parameters only apply when using a specific set of computational
parameters (functional, basis set, relativistic corrections). The
calculated EFG yields a predicted quadrupole splitting through the
relationship given in eq 1, where e is the charge of an electron, Q is the quadrupole moment of the 57Fe nucleus
(0.16(1) barn,3 and Vzz is the major component of the EFG. Comparison of these to
experiment is complicated by the fact that the sign of the experimental
quadrupole splitting is not determined in a zero-field measurement,
and thus most researchers simply use the absolute value of the quadrupole
splitting for comparison to experiment. 1  Though the number of DFT studies on Mössbauer
parameters is too large to describe them all, a few are particularly
worth noting. Oldfield et al. established an early precedent for predicting
Mössbauer parameters of paramagnetic complexes in various spin
states as well as the use of relativistic corrections for improving
isomer shift predictions.6d Noodleman et
al. examined different classes of iron complexes and proteins with
particular focus on iron-nitrosyl and iron-sulfur species, and extended
their results to prediction of intermediates in metalloproteins, such
as ribonucleotide reductase.6c,6f,6g,7e,9f Neese et al. compared pure and hybrid functionals along with various
basis sets for the prediction of Mössbauer parameters for simple
iron compounds.6b,6e,9b Filatov et al. reported a new method based on energy derivatives
due to the excitation of the 57Fe nucleus enabling isomer
shift calculations without a correlation with experimental results.10 Friesner et al. benchmarked many functionals
and basis sets on a broad range of iron compounds, established the
use of X-ray structures for Mössbauer parameter predictions,
and extended their results to assessing the validity of proposed methane
monooxygenase intermediates.9c Pápai
et al. published an extensive benchmark study using a wide range of
iron compounds, and compared GGA and hybrid functionals, STO and GTO
basis sets, and effects of solvation models on Mössbauer parameter
predictions.9d They also discussed potential
difficulties with the correlation of computation to experiment, including
low-lying excited states, geometrical isomerism, and spin state changes.
More recent reports have focused on expansion of these ideas to new
ligand systems, inclusion of experimental error in the development
of the correlation fits, as well as new methods for structure optimization,
including systems requiring periodic boundary conditions.11

We became interested in computing Mössbauer
parameters for
reduced β-diketiminate supported iron complexes to validate
calculations on their electronic structures.8 These showed us that the existing correlations have few examples
of multimetallic complexes, redox-active ligands, low-valent, and
low-coordinate iron complexes. Additionally, the established correlations
use continuum solvation models with the polarity of water9b or methanol,9d whereas
the iron complexes of interest to our group are often studied experimentally
in less polar solvents, such as toluene. When using the isomer shift
correlation reported by Neese and co-workers, we often calculated
isomer shifts that had systematic deviations from experiment (0.1–0.2
mm s−1 lower in the calculations) despite the optimized
geometries agreeing quite well with the crystal structure geometries.8a,8e The need to address these issues and the large number of zero-field
Mössbauer spectra that we have now collected on related systems
encouraged us to seek a more applicable correlation as well as the
most facile method for the calculations. Others have also noted that
the isomer shift correlations in the literature often need to be “tuned”
to different kinds of environments, for example iron-sulfur clusters.12

Herein, we report a revised set of correlation
parameters between
the calculated electron density and the experimental isomer shift.
We use ORCA, a free platform for computations that has implemented
a simple readout for Mössbauer parameters,13 and utilize the common functional B3LYP, which has been
validated in many earlier studies. Importantly, the new correlation
comes from a representative subset of β-diketiminate complexes
as a training set, and we test the effectiveness of this correlation
for prediction of Mössbauer parameters using a test set of
different complexes. Furthermore, we test the correlation more generally
using other low-valent iron complexes with different ligand types
having various donors (carbon donors, phosphines, thiolates, and hydrides).
The power of the same computations for prediction of quadrupole splitting
values is also evaluated for all complexes. As experimentalists ourselves,
we were also motivated to evaluate the tools that are often used to
make computations feasible for the nonspecialist. Thus, we describe
the effects of ligand truncation in the computations, and the effect
of the spin state on predicted isomer shift and quadrupole splitting
values in selected examples.

Results
Nine iron β-diketiminate
complexes were chosen as a training
set to calibrate the relationship between the calculated electron
densities and the experimental isomer shifts. The complexes were specifically
chosen because they had very high-quality X-ray structures with no
disorder and span a variety of oxidation states, spin states, and
coordination numbers. We purposely chose a small representative training
set because we wanted to be able to test the quality of this correlation
with independent compounds and structures that are not part of the
training set. A list of the training set complexes along with coordination
number, formal oxidation state, spin state, and experimental isomer
shifts are given in Table 1, and the labeling scheme is given in Figure 2. The isomer shift is temperature dependent
due to the second-order Doppler shift, which is often minimal (<0.02
mm s–1) at liquid N2 temperatures and
below, however the exact contribution depends on the effective mass
of the absorber and bonding environment.3,14 Due to the
lack of a generality of this dependence, we chose to include data
irrespective of the temperature of measurement. Only literature spectra
referenced to α-Fe at 298–300 K were chosen.

We chose to fit the training set results with a single
line for
each basis set choice (eq 2), a strategy that was employed by Neese and by Pápai to generalize
single correlations without need to select fit parameters based on
oxidation state of the metal center.9b,9d Some other
studies break down the test sets into smaller groups using parameters
such as oxidation state and ligand sphere, and then establish a linear
correlation for each subset,9c but we disfavor
this strategy because it cannot be applied to complexes with redox-active
ligands or with unusual environments in which there is no independent,
unambiguous determination of the oxidation state. Also note that many
of the complexes examined in this report contain π-accepting
ligands or redox-active ligands that can drastically affect the electron
density at the iron center. In these cases, Mössbauer spectroscopy
has been useful in assigning the “true” oxidation state
of the metal center over the formal oxidation state established by
charge counting, which can differ substantially.9c 2  In eq 2, δ is
the isomer shift, ρ(0) is the calculated
electron density at Fe, α and β are calibration constants
with C as an unrefined constant that is subtracted
from ρ(0) to avoid a fit where the β parameter is unreasonably
large. Parameters for the fits developed from the training set of
compounds, the square of the correlation coefficient (R2), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the maximum deviation
from experiment (max. dev.), are given in Table 2 and shown in Figure 3. The fit values of α are within error
of the experimental value of 0.31 ± 0.04 a03 mm s–1, which has been estimated from the change
in electron capture rate of 52Fe in different iron compounds.20

toward other compounds reported by our group as well as the generality
toward other ligand classes, the ability of the correlation to evaluate
different spin states, and the efficacy in predicting Mössbauer
parameters for spectra collected at temperatures other than 80 K.

isomer shifts are shown in Table 3 along with the isomer shifts calculated using the

Uncertainty statistics for
the isomer shift predictions are given
in Table 4, which gives
both the MAE and the standard deviation. We also give the largest
deviation seen in the test set, which gives the “worst-case”
scenario. These data show no clear empirical preference for CP(PPP)
over def2-TZVP as the errors for both basis sets are comparable for
all classes of compounds examined. Neese and Pápai similarly
have seen little improvement in statistics when using CP(PPP), but
favor the larger basis set because it is specially designed for core
properties.9b,9d Despite the theoretical justification
for the CP(PPP) basis set, def2-TZVP performed comparably to CP(PPP)
over the set of compounds examined with a 0.001 mm s–1 difference in MAE, which is well within the accepted experimental
error (±0.02 mm s–1) for Mössbauer spectroscopy.
The computations using CP(PPP) as the basis set on iron took on average
1.46 times longer than when def2-TZVP was used on all atoms. Considering
the savings of computational resources along with the comparable accuracy
of the two basis sets, we find that def2-TZVP is the most efficient
choice for computational predictions of the Mössbauer isomer
shift.

We were gratified
to discover that this new correlation performed
much better for compounds that had been problematic when using the
correlation from Neese.9b For example,
in a recent study of diketiminate compounds with bridging pyridine
ligands,8e two compounds were addressed
computationally. In one, the experimental isomer shift of 0.76 mm
s–1 was far from the previously calculated value
of 0.59 mm s–1, but the method described here predicted
a closer value of 0.70 mm s–1 (Table 3, row 11). In a diiron compound
with inequivalent iron centers, the experimental isomer shifts of
0.76 and 0.67 mm s–1 were predicted to be 0.62 and
0.52 mm s–1 using the literature correlation, whereas
the method described here predicted much closer values of 0.73 and
0.71 mm s–1 (Table 3, row 12).

Prediction of Quadrupole Splitting
Previous studies
observed larger errors in predicted quadrupole splitting values as
the magnitude of the quadrupole splitting increases.9c,9d Our calculations show similar scattering at larger quadrupole splitting
values (Table 5), and
therefore we have included the percent error statistics with the caveat
that this measure downplays large errors in large values in Table 6. Overall, both basis
sets performed equally well at predicting the quadrupole splitting
for the compounds examined. Given the much greater computational resources
needed for CP(PPP) versus def2-TZVP, we again favor def2-TZVP for
computational predictions.

Testing
the Use of Crystallographic Geometries versus Optimized
Geometries
Previously, Friesner and co-workers examined the
calculation of Mössbauer parameters, comparing between using
the geometry from X-ray crystallography versus using a DFT optimized
structure.9c They concluded that as long
as the X-ray structure and DFT geometry were in good agreement, the
predicted Mössbauer parameters derived from each should not
be significantly different. On the other hand, Pápái
and co-workers state that the error in X-ray structures due to thermal
motion can affect the calculation of Mössbauer parameters and
support the use of DFT optimized geometries.9d Nemykin and Noodleman have employed both methods, with emphasis
on the need for geometry optimization to closely match the X-ray structures.6c,6f,6g,7e,9a,9f Common issues
not addressed in these studies are the impact of crystal packing effects
on the molecular geometry at iron and disorder in the X-ray structures.
Our experience is that it is fairly common to have two polymorphs
of the same complex or two different crystal structures of the same
complex with different solvents of crystallization. Additionally,
it is frequently observed that there are two crystallographically
independent molecules in an X-ray crystal structure, and sometimes
the bond distances/angles differ between the inequivalent molecules.
Disorder of ligands can also lead to multiple observed molecular configurations
for the same compound. Using X-ray coordinates as a report of molecular
geometry also introduces another problem because X-ray diffraction
measures electron density rather than nuclear positions, and thus
there is systematic shortening of all distances to H atoms (by ∼0.1
Å) in the refined structures.31 Below,
we show that these crystallographic issues can lead to large inaccuracies
in computationally predicted parameters if a full geometry optimization
is not performed.

To evaluate this issue, we computationally
examined LMeFe(NCtBu)2, a compound reported previously by Cowley et al.8c It is an ideal test case for the influence of crystal packing
because the asymmetric unit in the X-ray crystal structure contained
three chemically identical but crystallographically independent molecules
of LMeFe(NCtBu)2. In addition to performing point calculations on the crystallographic
geometries with only the H atom positions optimized, we also performed
a full geometry optimization on each independent molecule. For each
of the six resulting geometries, the electron density at the nucleus
and quadrupole splitting were calculated (Table 7). (It is most appropriate to compare the
electron densities rather than converting them to isomer shifts as
the correlation fit parameters reported above are from a fully optimized
training set. The predicted isomer shifts are also given to demonstrate
the variation.)

a The numbers in parentheses are the
calculated isomer shifts according to our computational method.

For the fully optimized structures
the calculated ρ(0) using
both def2-TZVP and CP(PPP) vary by less than 0.01 a0−3 among the three structures, as would be expected
since these structures should optimize to the same energy minimum
regardless of the starting geometry. This would lead to a difference
of less than 0.003 mm s–1 in the calculated isomer
shift, well within the uncertainty of the correlation (±0.05
mm s−1) as well as the uncertainty of the measured
isomer shift (±0.02 mm s−1). For the structures
with only H-atoms optimized, on the other hand, there is significant
variation in the computed electron densities of nearly 0.2 a0–3. This would correspond to changes in the calculated
isomer shift of 0.05 mm s–1 using the correlations
reported here, which is on the order of the error in the isomer shift
prediction. Thus, optimizing only H atoms can introduce a significant
source of error in cases wherein multiple molecules are present in
the asymmetric unit or disorder gives multiple conformations.

Similarly, the calculated quadrupole splitting varied less in the
fully optimized geometries (0.04 mm s–1) than in
the H-atom only optimized geometries (0.24 mm s–1). Again, the magnitude of the error in the predicted quadrupole
splitting was similar to the uncertainty in our best correlation (0.27
mm s–1). In both parameters, less variation is observed
for fully optimized geometries leading to the conclusion that a full
geometry optimization is best, because systematic error is introduced
by selection of a random molecule within the asymmetric unit or a
particular polymorph.

It is also useful to comment on the accuracy
of X-ray crystallographic
structures. Despite the ubiquity of X-ray crystallography and the
high level of faith that the inorganic chemistry community places
in crystallographic results, it is important to remember that crystallographic
analysis gives metrical parameters with an accuracy that is poorer
than the “estimated standard deviations” that arise
from the refinement protocol.32 Even more
serious systematic deviations have been noted in some cases.33 Treating Mössbauer spectroscopy as an
independent check of geometries is therefore valuable. In the case
discussed above, the Mössbauer spectrum of the crystalline
solid shows narrow lines and Lorentzian line shapes that indicate
a relatively unvarying geometry in the crystal, though the bond distances
around Fe vary by 0.02 Å and orientations of the nitriles vary
by 90° in the crystallographic structure. Our computations show
that these would lead to a variation in Mössbauer parameters
of ∼0.05 mm s–1, which would have led to
a ∼20% increase in the broadness of the right line of the spectra,
as indicated by simulations (Figures S-3 and S-4). The fact that this broadening was not observed implies that the
deviations between the geometries of independent molecules in the
X-ray crystal structure are not real despite the good R value of 5.4% of the crystal structure. These results emphasize
the importance of confirming crystallographic conclusions using an
independent measure, whether spectroscopic or computational (or both).
Of course, using the DFT-optimized structure is not without danger
either, as DFT optimization can give inaccurate geometries, particularly
in cases of low-lying excited states, ambiguous spin states, and shallow
potential energy surfaces.

Ferrocene presents another interesting
test case because the Cambridge
Structural Database contains 27 different crystal structures of this
molecule, including a polymorph with staggered Cp rings (“staggered
1 & 2”) with two refinements of the same data, a second
similar polymorph (“staggered 3”), and a separate structure
with eclipsed Cp rings (“eclipsed 1”).34 Because we were unsure of the effect of crystal packing,
we independently collected both solid and solution Mössbauer
spectra on purified ferrocene samples at 80 K (Figures S-1 and S-2), and both spectra were virtually identical
with isomer shifts of 0.53 mm s–1 and quadrupole
splittings of 2.41 mm s–1 (2.40 mm s–1 for frozen toluene solution). These match well with the solid-state
parameters reported by Foyt et al. at 78 K.27 The minimal difference between the solid-state spectrum and frozen
solution spectrum suggests that there is little influence of crystal
packing effects on the Mössbauer parameters. Despite the similarity
of the experimental parameters for solid-state and solution samples,
we observed variation in the H-atom only optimized structures on the
order of 0.05 mm s–1 but only 0.001 mm s–1 variation in the fully optimized DFT structures (Table 8). The quadrupole splitting
for the H-atom only optimizations varied by nearly 0.30 mm s–1, whereas in the fully optimized structures they varied by only 0.01
mm s–1. Interestingly, calculations on atomic positional
parameters from two different reported refinements of the same neutron
diffraction data34 (staggered 1 & 2)
led to isomer shifts that differed by more than 0.04 mm s–1 with both basis sets. These results are consistent with those of
the nitrile complex described above, and further support the conclusion
that use of an unoptimized geometry from an X-ray crystal structure
introduces a source of error when predicting Mössbauer parameters.

We note that for Cp2Fe, both the optimized and nonoptimized
structures gave a substantial difference in the experimental versus
computed isomer shifts (0.53 vs 0.68 mm s–1) (see
below). This is not from a problem with the reported experimental
Mössbauer parameters because we independently verified the
Mössbauer spectrum (see Supporting Information). We also evaluated whether an eclipsed structure of ferrocene could
give rise to the difference. Both an H-atom only optimization and
a full DFT optimization of an eclipsed D5h structure led
to isomer shift values very similar to those computed for the staggered
structure (<0.02 mm s–1 difference) consistent
with the results reported by Nemykin for the two conformers.9a Therefore, the structure does not account for
the 0.15 mm s–1 difference between theory and experiment.
We do not yet have an explanation for this large deviation, as Nemykin
was able to reproduce the experimental isomer shift using B3LYP with
Wacheter’s full electron basis set.9a

Overall, despite the low accuracy of the computations for
the prediction
of the isomer shift for ferrocene and the quadrupole splitting for
LMeFe(NCtBu)2, in
each case, the variation in predicted Mössbauer parameters
observed in H-atom optimized structures had lower precision than the
fully optimized structures. These two case studies demonstrate the
importance of full optimization prior to prediction of parameters.

Limitations of the Computational
Protocol
Cp and associated
derivatives are prevalent ligands throughout inorganic and organometallic
chemistry. Ferrocene, a classic example of such Cp compounds, has
been examined by DFT calculations previously and attempts to predict
the isomer shift have led to deviations from experiment for other
authors as well.9a,9d Using the protocols in this report,
we examined ferrocene as well as a recent coordination compound [Cp*Fe(S2Ph)(N2H2)FeCp*]− that
contains pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*). In both cases, the fully
optimized geometry matched well with the reported crystal structure
and no significant deviations in bond distances were observed. Despite
geometric agreement between experimental and computed structures,
the predicted isomer shifts for these compounds were overestimated
by computations by >0.15 mm s–1, whereas the
predicted
quadrupole splittings generally compared quite well with experiment
(<10% deviation) (Table 9). On the basis of these results, we do not recommend use
of these conditions for prediction of Mössbauer parameters
for compounds with Cp-based ligands as there is a systematic error
in the isomer shift when compared with that of the experiment. Pápai
et al. found better agreement for ferrocene with use of Slater-type
(STO) TZP all electron basis set regardless of the functional employed.9d,9h

We did not observe consistent
deviations for other ligand classes,
but we note that low-coordinate N-heterocyclic carbene
complexes (NHC) and cyclic alkyl amino carbene (cAAC) complexes showed
sporadic larger deviations in both isomer shift (>0.1 mm s–1) and quadrupole splitting (>0.8 mm s–1). We also
looked for systematic deviations associated with the formal oxidation
state of iron and the coordination number of the iron (Tables 10 and 11). On the basis of formal oxidation states, the two basis sets examined
have comparable accuracies across all oxidation states with predictions
for iron(II) compounds having the greatest errors in predicted isomer
shifts when using def2-TZVP. Previous studies have noted iron(II)
compounds with S = 1 or 2 can have low-lying excited
states or electronically degenerate ground states that can affect
the calculated parameters,10 but we made
no special efforts to account for these effects in this study. The
results based on the coordination number at iron were comparable for
both basis sets for all coordination numbers (2–6). Overall,
def2-TZVP performed better than CP(PPP) for most coordination numbers
for quadrupole splitting predictions, except 4-coordinate where CP(PPP)
was slightly (1.6%) better.

Distinguishing
Spin States Using Mössbauer Correlations
The spin
state of a metal center affects the electron distribution
within the d-orbital manifold, which in turn influences the isomer
shift and quadrupole splitting parameters. Therefore, in cases where
the magnetization of a sample is not easily measured or the compound
of interest is present in a mixture with other paramagnetic compounds,
we hypothesized that DFT calculations can be used to compare computed
Mössbauer parameters for various spin states with experimental
parameters. Pápái has previously examined the accuracy
of quadrupole splitting parameter predictions in spin-crossover compounds
wherein two spin states have been experimentally observed.9d Long explored prediction of Mössbauer
parameters for known high- and low-spin pyrazolylborate complexes
and clustering of computed parameters was observed based on spin state.9g We examined the sensitivity of the predicted
Mössbauer parameters toward changes in spin state for three
of the complexes in the test set: one high spin, one intermediate
spin, and one low spin. Each structure was optimized in the high spin,
intermediate spin (when applicable), and low spin configurations,
and then the Mössbauer parameters were computed (Table 12).

Using our favored protocol with def2-TZVP as the basis
set on iron,
the isomer shift became more positive as the total spin increased
as is expected.3 The average difference
between computed isomer shifts between spin states was 0.17 mm s–1 with a minimum difference of 0.08 mm s–1, values that are 5 and 2 times the MAE for the correlation with
β-diketiminate complexes described above. The average difference
in quadrupole splitting was 1.11 mm s–1 for different
spin states with a minimum difference of 0.18 mm s–1. The average difference is 4 times larger than the MAE for predicted
quadrupole splittings in β-diketiminate complexes (0.27 mm s–1), whereas the minimum difference is about half of
this error. In all three cases, comparison of the optimized geometry
and computed Mössbauer parameters agree best with experiment
for the spin state that has been experimentally determined. This suggests
that computations can indeed aid in determining the spin state of
a compound, and we encourage the use of this protocol for compounds
whose magnetic susceptibility or spin state cannot be determined by
more rigorous means.

Truncating Computational Models
Sterically bulky ligands
are often used to control the geometry, solubility, or other properties
of iron complexes. However, the size of these ligands greatly increases
the computational cost. Therefore, it is common to use truncated computational
models to increase the speed of calculations; we have pursued this
route with many diketiminate complexes.35 As part of our evaluation, we tested whether truncation can harm
the validity of the computed Mössbauer parameters. Specifically,
we tested the influence of truncation on the accuracy of the predicted
spectral parameters for three complexes with different bulky ligands
(Figure 4 and Table 13).

Figure 4 Complexes examined for
effects of ligand truncation on Mössbauer
parameter prediction. (a) LtBuFe(HCCPh), (b) (SiPiPr3)FeCOSi(CH3)3, (c) LS,SFe(THF)2.

Comparison between a DFT optimized geometry and the geometry
of
the solid-state molecular structure is the most commonly used metric
for assessing the validity of a truncated DFT model. In these three
examples, a variety of degrees of truncation did not lead to significant
deviations from the X-ray structure and, with LS,SFe(THF)2, even led to metrics more similar to the crystal structure
(Table 14). The predicted
isomer shifts in two of the three cases exhibited very little change
(≤0.04 mm s–1). The third case, (SiPiPr3)FeCOSi(CH3)3, exhibited
the largest deviations upon truncation (∼0.1 mm s–1), which is on the order of errors observed for non-β-diketiminate
compounds using the correlations established in this work. The predicted
quadrupole splittings did not deviate greatly upon increased truncation
for the three examples: it is less than the error for the quadrupole
splitting predictions observed for the set of compounds. In each case,
the computational time was an order of magnitude less for the greatest
degree of truncation compared with that of the parent complex. Thus,
the cost in accuracy from truncation appears to be limited relative
to the great advantage in computational resources, but all truncation
should be done with caution because there are sometimes deviations
in the calculated parameters that do not appear to correlate with
observed geometry deviations.

Conclusions
DFT
calculations on β-diketiminate compounds with various
spin states, geometries, and ligand spheres were used to establish
correlations for the prediction of Mössbauer isomer shifts
using a set of standard optimization conditions. Our results indicate
that def2-TZVP and CP(PPP) are similar in their predictive ability,
and the former is preferable due to greater computational expediency.
Full geometry optimizations are essential. The predictive power of
the correlations was tested with a test set of β-diketiminate
complexes as well as a variety of other iron complexes using the same
procedure. These correlations have a mean average error (MAE) of 0.035
mm s–1 for β-diketiminate complexes, an improvement
from other previously reported conditions and 0.05 mm s–1 for all compounds tested, which is comparable to other correlations.
Quadrupole splitting parameters were also calculated for the compounds
tested showing good agreement with experiment with MAE of 0.30 mm
s–1 for all compounds.

We also tested other
factors, such as the use of X-ray geometries
and truncation of computational models. We found DFT geometry optimization
to be extremely important for obtaining reliable values in the cases
we tried. However, it should be remembered that the optimized geometry
can be predicted poorly by DFT, and so care should be taken. Comparison
of experimental Mössbauer parameters with the computed results
from different spin states successfully reproduced experiment in three
of three test cases; thus, these computations are powerful in their
ability to support spin-state assignment. Similarly, we examined the
effects of truncation of large ligands, which showed that even major
truncation led to <5% change in geometry metrics around the metal
center and minimal changes in Mössbauer parameters predicted.
Overall, we anticipate that the protocols established here will assist
others for using Mössbauer spectroscopy coupled with computations
for reliable characterization of new compounds.

Computational Details
DFT calculations were performed with the ORCA program package,
version 3.0.3.13 Optimized geometries were
computed using the BP86 functional.36 Atom-pairwise
dispersion correction with the Becke–Johnson damping scheme
(D3BJ),37 the scalar relativistic zero-order
regular approximation (ZORA),38 and the
scalar relativistically recontracted version of the Aldrichs triple-ζ
basis set, def2-TZVP,39 were used on all
atoms. Mössbauer parameters were calculated using the B3LYP40 functional with either all atoms modeled with
the def2-TZVP basis set or a combination of the CP(PPP) for the iron
atom with all other atoms modeled with def2-TZVP. It was important
to test both because CP(PPP)6b,6e,9b has been reported as best for calculation of the electronic properties
in independent benchmark studies by Neese and Pápai, but has
significantly higher resource costs.9b,9d The conductor-like
screening model41 (COSMO) was used to simulate
a toluene solution (ε = 2.4). The choice of solvent model was
used to best simulate the environment of organometallic complexes
and β-diketiminate complexes in the solid state, wherein the
aryl groups of the supporting ligands are most generally the closest
contacts between molecules. Resolution of identity (RI) was used to
approximate two electron integrals, but this was used only for geometry
optimizations; the calculations of Mössbauer parameters did
not use RI because we have observed substantial variations in calculated
Mössbauer parameters when RI is used. Geometry optimization
started from the X-ray crystallographic models and was tightly converged
(TightOpt). The SCF calculations were tightly converged (TightSCF)
with unrestricted spin (UKS). Numerical integrations during all DFT
calculations were done on a dense grid (ORCA grid4), and for Mössbauer
calculations a very dense grid (ORCA grid 7) was used on the iron
atoms. The calculated structures were confirmed to be minima on the
potential energy surfaces by the absence of imaginary frequencies
after numerical frequency calculations on the optimized structures.
Noncoordinating counterions and solvent were not included in the calculations
because previous studies have demonstrated that these have a minimal
effect on the calculated Mössbauer parameters.9b,9c,9e,42
