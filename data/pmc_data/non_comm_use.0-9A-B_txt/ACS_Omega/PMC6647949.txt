This paper develops
a novel ultrasonic spray-assisted solvothermal (USS) method to synthesize
wrapped ZnO/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites with a Schottky
junction for gas-sensing applications. The as-obtained ZnO/rGO-x samples with different graphene oxide (GO) contents (x = 0–1.5 wt %) are characterized by various techniques,
and their gas-sensing properties for NO2 and other VOC
gases are also evaluated. The results show that the USS-derived ZnO/rGO
samples exhibit high NO2-sensing property at low operating
temperatures (e.g., 70–130 °C) because of their high specific
surface area and porous structures when compared with the ZnO/rGO
sample obtained by the traditional precipitation method. The content
of rGO shows an obvious effect on their NO2-sensing properties,
and the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sample has a high response of 62 operating at
130 °C, three times that of pure ZnO. The detection limit of
the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sensor to NO2 is as low as 10 ppb under
the present test condition. In addition, the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sensor shows
a highly selective response to NO2 gas when compared with
organic vapors and other inflammable or toxic gases. The theoretical
and experimental analyses indicate that the enhancement in NO2-sensing performance of the ZnO/rGO sensor is attributed to
the formation of wrapped ZnO/rGO Schottky junctions.

Introduction
With
the expansion of industrial production and family automobiles, the
issue of environmental pollution has begun to attract increasing attention
because of the big threat to the human health and ecological environment.1−3 Among the pollution sources, especially gaseous pollutants such
as NO2, CO, SO2, H2S, and volatile
organic compound (VOC) gases have become a chief culprit.4,5 Nitric oxides (NO and NO2) generated from vehicle exhausts
and chemical plants are the main source of acid rain, and the acidification
caused by acid rain seriously damages crops and the ecological environment.6,7 NO2 is also one of the major inducements of hazes which
cause a large number of respiratory diseases and other bad impacts
on the human health.8 In order to effectively
monitor and control the discharge of NO2 gases and other
harmful gases, gas-sensing materials and devices have attracted much
attention worldwide.9,10 For this ends, semiconductor
materials are the focus in the field of gas sensors.11−13 For detecting NO2, a number of gas sensors based on semiconductors
have been developed (see Table S1, Supporting Information).14,15 Because of the chemical stability
and low cost, NO2 sensors based on metal oxides, such as
ZnO,16−18 SnO2,19−21 WO3,22−24 Fe2O3,25,26 and NiO,27,28 have widely been reported. Because of the high operating temperatures
(higher than 200–600 °C), these sensors are limited in
the practical applications.

Recent research shows that Schottky
junction-based gas sensors enable ultrasensitive and rapid response
to gas detection.29,30 The basis for the Schottky junction
to enhance gas-sensing performance is to change the height of the
Schottky barrier. The change of the barrier causes the resistance
change of the gas sensitive material to finally change the acquired
electrical signal.29 Recently, reduced
graphene oxide (rGO) materials with large specific surface areas and
excellent electrical conductivity have been widely used in gas sensors,31,32 and the rGO-related materials possess rich surface functional groups
that can effectively improve the gas-sensing performance and reduce
the operating temperature.33,34 The work functions
of zero-bandgap rGO and n-type semiconductor ZnO are about 4.75 and
4.1 eV, respectively, with a work function difference of 0.65 eV which
is helpful to form a suitable Schottky junction.35−37 Song et al.38 reported an rGO/ZnO composite as the
photoanodes for solar cells, and its photo-to-current conversion efficiency
was 1.3 times higher than that of the pure ZnO because of the existence
of the Schottky junction. The ZnO/rGO composite with a Schottky junction
can be a promising ultrasensitive gas-sensing material.39

The ultrasonic spray is the use of electronic
high-frequency oscillation generated cavitation to break up liquid
precursors to produce natural and elegant water mist.40−44 The ultrasonic spray method has been widely used in spray and coating
processes for the synthesis of various functional nanocomposites.
Chai et al.40 used the ultrasonic spray
method to deposit methylamine iodide on a PbI2 substrate
and transformed PbI2 into a more uniform and thicker perovskite
film for solar cells. Almuntaser et al.41 used the ultrasonic spray method to synthesize inverted OSC with
an active layer infiltrated in the ZnO nanorod array. Ji et al.44 prepared highly efficient all-inorganic quantum-dot
light-emitting diodes by the ultrasonic atomization process using
NiO and ZnO as active materials. These reports show that the ultrasonic
spray is an effective technology to synthesize nanoparticles and thin
films with high homogeneity and stability.42 Their sizes can be conveniently controlled by changing the concentration
of their precursor solutions and atomizing parameters.43

In our work, we have developed various
methods to synthesize nanomaterials for gas-sensing applications.11−13,20,31,45−47 Inspired by the above
research, we herein develop an ultrasonic spray-assisted solvothermal
(USS) method to synthesize wrapped structured ZnO/rGO nanocomposites
with Schottky junctions for gas-sensing applications (Figure 1). The as-obtained ZnO/rGO
nanocomposites synthesized by the USS method exhibit high-performance
NO2-sensing property at relatively low operating temperatures
(e.g., 70–130 °C). When compared with the ZnO/rGO sample
obtained by the traditional precipitation method, the USS-derived
ZnO/rGO sample shows a higher specific surface area and porous structure,
which provides the theoretical basis to achieve a good gas-sensing
property. This paper has systematically characterized the as-obtained
ZnO/rGO composites using various techniques and their gas-sensing
behaviors have been well evaluated. The related mechanisms for the
synthesis and gas-sensing properties of ZnO/rGO nanocomposites have
also been discussed.

of ZnO/rGO nanocomposites as active materials for gas-sensing applications.

Results and Discussion
Formation of ZnO/rGO Nanocomposites
There are three possible chemical processes involved in the formation
of ZnO/rGO nanocomposites. The first reaction is the precipitation
of Zn2+ ions, that is, Zn2+ + 2OH– → Zn(OH)2; then the Zn(OH)2 species
transform to ZnO nanocrystals via a nucleation and growth process
under the solvothermal condition, that is, Zn(OH)2 →
ZnO.48 Meanwhile, the alkaline environment
with pH > 7 facilitates the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) to
partly form rGO, that is, GO → rGO.49 In the first step, Zn2+ ions are adsorbed on GO nanosheets,
forming GO/Zn(OH)2 species in an alkaline solution during
ultrasonic spray and stirring. In the second step, GO species are
in situ reduced to rGO, and the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites are formed
during the solvothermal treatment at 180 °C. The cavitation forces
generated by the ultrasonic spray process during the addition of the
Zn2+/GO suspension ensure that the GO completely and uniformly
disperses and coated with Zn(OH)2 particles, providing
regular growth conditions during the hydrothermal process. Then, the
in situ growth of ZnO nanocrystals on rGO nanosheets make the ZnO
particles tightly attach to the rGO surface, and the strong interaction
between ZnO nanocrystals and rGO nanosheets is favorable for efficient
electron transport at their interface. To investigate the effect of
rGO on the NO2-sensing performance, we synthesized a series
of ZnO/rGO nanocomposites with various mass ratios (0.5–1.5%)
of rGO to ZnO using the ultrasonic spray solvothermal process. For
comparisons, the traditional precipitation method was used to synthesize
p-ZnO/GO-0.5. Pure ZnO nanocrystals without GO was also synthesized.

Characterization of ZnO/rGO Nanocomposites
The phases and
chemical compositions of the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites were first characterized
using the techniques of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. Figure 2 shows the typical XRD patterns of GO, ZnO, and ZnO/rGO
samples. One can see that ZnO and ZnO/rGO nanocomposites with various
rGO contents have peaks at Bragg angles (2θ) of 31.7°,
34.4°, and 36.2°, assignable to the (110), (002), and (101)
planes of the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS no. 79-206), respectively.48 The XRD peaks of the ZnO/rGO-0.5 nanocomposite
are sharper and stronger than those of the ZnO/rGO-1.5 but weaker
than those of the pure ZnO sample. It seems to suggest that the addition
of GO influences the crystallinity of the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites.
For the ZnO growth, rGO nanosheets act as the nuclei through a heterogeneous
nucleation and growth process. For GO (Figure 2a), the broadened XRD peak at ∼23°
is the characteristic of the (002) plane of GO. The strong peak at
∼10° belongs to the layered structure of GO restacking.
Thermogravimetric analysis can prove the existence of carbon (Figure S1). The weak XRD peak at 43° in
GO disappears in the ZnO/rGO samples because of the small content
and high dispersion of GO in the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites.

and (b) Raman spectra of the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites: (A) GO, (B) ZnO,
(C) ZnO/rGO-0.5, (D) ZnO/rGO-1, and (E) ZnO/rGO-1.5; (c) detailed
Raman spectrum of ZnO nanocrystals.

The presence of rGO in the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites was further
confirmed by Raman spectra. Figure 2b shows the typical Raman spectra of GO, ZnO, and ZnO/rGO
nanocomposites, and their detailed Raman data are summarized in Table 1. The pristine GO
and ZnO/rGO nanocomposites exhibit two characteristic peaks at ∼1345
and 1591–1598 cm–1, belonging to the D band
and the G band of graphene, respectively; the D band corresponds to
the breathing mode of k-point phonons of the A1g symmetry near the edges of graphitic structures (local defects
or disorder)50 and the G band belongs to
the E2g mode of sp2 domains of the rGO species.51 The ratio (ID/IG) of the D (at 1346 cm–1)
and G (at 1598 cm–1) bands of GO is about 1.01;
the ID/IG ratios
of the ZnO/rGO samples increase to ≥1.07 (Table 1). The ZnO/rGO-0.5 sample shows
the D and G bands at 1346 and 1593 cm–1, respectively.
The G band increases from 1593 to 1596 cm–1 as the
rGO amount increases from 0.5 to 1.5%. In the hydrothermal process,
numerous functional groups on GO, like carboxyl groups and hydroxyl
groups, act as reactive sites to immobilize Zn2+. The Raman
peaks (D and G bands) verify the existence of rGO in the ZnO/rGO samples.49,52 In the ZnO/rGO-x samples (x =
0.5, 1 and 1.5), the second-order D (2D) bands at ∼2667 cm–1 and D + G bands at ∼2918 cm–1, belonging to rGO, reconfirm the formation of rGO in the in situ
solvothermal process. The 2D band is related to the number of layers
in the rGO, and an intense and sharp band means monolayer rGO species.53 The 2D/G intensity ratios of single-, double-,
triple-, and multi-layer graphene sheets are >1.6, ≈0.8,
≈0.30, and ≈0.07, respectively.54 In this work, the 2D/G intensity ratio is found to be 0.11 for the
ZnO/rGO-0.5 nanocomposite, indicating that the number of rGO layers
is between three and four layers. The wide bands at 439–1200
cm–1 belonging to ZnO can be found in the ZnO/rGO
nanocomposites.

Figure 2c shows the Raman spectrum of pure ZnO. The
single-crystal wurtzite structure of ZnO belongs to the C6v4 (P63mc) symmetry group,
there are two identical formula units in each primitive cell, and
all the atoms in the primitive cell occupy the 2b position with the C3v symmetry.55 The phonon dispersion relationship of ZnO consists of 12
branches in the Brillouin zone (q = 0), and one can
deduce that Γ = 2 × (A1 + B1 + E1 + E2) according to the group theory.56 In these modes, the Γ points of the Brillouin
zone are divided into eight groups, which are A1(TO), A1(LO), B1L, B1H, E1(TO), E1(LO), E2H, and E2L, where the central
optical mode is Γopt = A1 + 2B1 + E1 + 2E2 and the phonon mode is Γaco = A1 + E1.57 In these optical phonon modes, A1 + E1 + 2E2 is Raman-activated; A1 and E1 are both
Raman and infrared-activated; for low-frequency and high-frequency
B1 is Raman inactive mode.58 Because A1 and E1 are polar, they can be divided
into transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons.
Raman-active E2 has high (E2high) and low-frequency
(E2low) phonon modes, which are respectively related to
the vibration of oxygen atoms and Zn sublattices.59,60

XPS is an important tool to get a better understanding of
the chemical state and composition of the ZnO/rGO nanocomposite. Figure 3 shows the XPS spectra
of ZnO/rGO-0.5. The survey spectrum in Figure 3a indicates that Zn, O, and C are the major
elements. Figure 3b
shows the Zn 2p spectrum, with two bands at 1045.0 and 1021.8 eV,
corresponding to Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 in the
form of ZnO, respectively.61 As Figure 3c shows that the
C 1s spectrum can be subdivided into four peaks at 289.6, 287.8, 285.8,
and 284.5 eV, corresponding to O–C=C, C–O–C/C=O,
C–O, and C–C/C=C (attributed to the sp2/sp3 carbon atom) functional groups of rGO, respectively.62−65 The O 1s XPS peak shown in Figure 3d can be decomposed into three Gaussian components
at ∼532.6, 531.9, and 531.0 eV; the bands at 531.9 and 531.0
eV can be indexed to chemisorbed oxygen (OC) species and
lattice oxygen (OL) in the wurtzite structure of hexagonal
ZnO, respectively;66 the band at 532.6
eV can be indexed to the C=O bond in the ZnO/rGO nanocomposite.67

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations were conducted
to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the GO, ZnO, and
ZnO/rGO nanocomposites, especially in comparing the ultrasonic spray
method with the traditional precipitation one. Figure 4 shows the typical results. The typical SEM
image of the pristine GO in Figure 4a indicates that the GO consists of restacking layers
with a large area. The SEM image (Figure 4b) of pure ZnO formed via the ultrasonic
spray process shows that the ZnO sample consists of apparent sheetlike
particles of 100–800 nm in size. Figure 4c,d shows the SEM images of the p-ZnO/rGO-0.5
and ZnO/rGO-0.5 nanocomposites, respectively. One can see that the
morphology of ZnO nanocrystals changes from a sheet-like shape to
a rod one when GO is added. The rodlike petals of the ZnO/rGO-0.5
nanocomposite have an average length of about 500 nm, which is about
two-thirds of the size of the p-ZnO/rGO-0.5 nanocomposite (about 800
nm). Figure 4e is a
high-magnification SEM image of a ZnO/rGO-0.5 material. We can identify
that the ultrasonic spray method effectively overcomes the agglomeration
of ZnO nanoparticles and reduces their particle sizes. From Figure 4c,e, one can see
that the graphene sheets cover the dispersed ZnO nanorods, marked
by arrows. This morphology allows the formation of a Schottky junction
between rGO and ZnO, enabling electrons to move freely to different
ZnO nanocrystals, and then improving the gas-sensing properties of
the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites. Figure 4f shows the SEM image of the ZnO/rGO-1.5 sample. With
more rGO added, flexible rGO sheets cover on the surface of ZnO or
mixed among ZnO flowers with visible edges. Comparing Figure 4d,f, there is no obvious change
in the grain size of the ZnO rods; however, more rGO results in agglomerative
ZnO petals. When comparing the ultrasonic spray and traditional precipitation
methods, one can find that the ultrasonic spray method is helpful
to make GO sheets well dispersing and wrapping in ZnO nanorods.

Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was further used to observe the microstructure of the ZnO/rGO
nanocomposite. Figure 4g–j shows the typical TEM and high resolution TEM (HRTEM)
images of the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sample. In Figure 4g, a low-magnification TEM image shows that
ZnO nanocrystals grow between rGO nanosheets, and the edge outlines
of rGO (marked by arrows) can be seen as the convincing evidence.
The high-magnification TEM image in Figure 4h suggests that the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sample consists
of ZnO nanorods tightly wrapped by rGO to form a core/shell-like configuration.
The HRTEM image in Figure 4i shows a clear view of the interface between ZnO and graphene.
The local enlargement of the interface is shown in Figure 4j, and one can easily find
two types of lattice fringes with different arrangement directions.
The lattice fringes with a d-spacing of ∼0.202
and ∼0.34 nm correspond to the (101) plane of wurtzite hexagonal
structure ZnO and the (002) plane of rGO, respectively.

Figure 5 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore-size distribution
curves of the ZnO/rGO-0.5 and p-ZnO/rGO-0.5 samples synthesized by
the traditional precipitation and ultrasonic spray methods to compare
their specific surface areas and pore-size distributions. The adsorption–desorption
isotherms of p-ZnO/rGO-0.5 are close to a type II shape (B in Figure 5a).68,69 As the interaction between adsorbate molecules is stronger than
that between the adsorbate and the adsorbent, it is difficult to adsorb
the adsorbate during the initial adsorption; the isotherms show a
concave shape, and the amount of adsorbed gas increases with the increase
in the partial pressure (P/P0). The ZnO/rGO-0.5 sample synthesized by the ultrasonic spray
method exhibits a type IV pattern with an H3 hysteresis
loop (A in Figure 5a), which indicates typical physical adsorption on nonporous or macroporous
adsorbents.68,70 There is a strong interaction
on the adsorbate surface, so the isotherm presents a convex shape.
The H3 hysteresis loop isotherm in the type IV pattern
isotherm and no obvious saturated adsorption platform indicate that
the pore structure of ZnO/rGO-0.5 is very irregular, corresponding
to sheetlike, rod-shaped materials, consistent with the observed microscopic
morphology (Figure 4). Because of the presence of fissure pores in the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites,
no adsorption saturation is observed as the relative pressure increased.68 According to their N2 physisorption
measurement, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
areas of the ZnO/rGO and p-ZnO/rGO-0.5 samples are 32.4 and 4.6 m2/g, respectively. Figure 5b shows the pore-size distribution curves of the ZnO/rGO
and p-ZnO/rGO-0.5 samples. One can see that the ZnO/rGO sample obtained
by the ultrasonic spray has a wide pore range of 2–200 nm and
a Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) desorption cumulative
pore volume of 0.112 cm3/g, whereas the p-ZnO/rGO-0.5 sample
obtained via the traditional precipitation method shows less pores
and a small BJH desorption cumulative pore volume of 0.013 cm3/g. According to the BJH model and the desorption result,
the average pore diameters (i.e., 4V/A) of the samples of p-ZnO/rGO-0.5 and ZnO/rGO-0.5 are 12.7 and 15.3
nm, respectively.71 The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms reveal that the ultrasonic spray method is efficient to
form porous and high-surface area nanocomposites.

Figure 5 (a) Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms and (b) pore-size distribution curves of (A) ultrasonic
spray-derived ZnO/rGO-0.5 and (B) precipitation-derived ZnO/rGO-0.5.

Taking SEM/TEM observations and
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms into account,
we can conclude that GO nanosheets and the ultrasonic spray process
highly influence the microstructure of the ZnO species in the ZnO/rGO-x nanocomposites, which are of a porous, high-surface area
structure with ZnO nanocrystals (400–600 nm). The pure ZnO
sample consists of sheetlike particles (0.8–1 μm), and
the p-ZnO/rGO-0.5 sample obtained by traditional precipitation exhibits
a nonporous and low-surface area structure.

Gas-Sensing Properties
of ZnO/rGO Nanocomposites
The ZnO/rGO-x samples
(x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) obtained via the ultrasonic
spray and precipitation methods are used to prepare sensors.

The NO2-sensing properties operating at various temperatures
(70–200 °C) upon exposure to NO2 with various
concentrations (0.5–50 ppm) were first tested. Figure 6 shows the R–t curves and the (Ra/Rg)–C response curves. When the operating temperature is 70 °C, as
shown in Figure 6a,
the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sample exhibits an obvious response to the NO2 gas with a low concentration of ≤10 ppm, but the pure
ZnO shows a weak response even to a 100 ppm NO2 gas. As
shown in Figure 6b,
the ZnO/rGO-x (x = 0.25, 0.5, 1)
sensors exhibit a sharp NO2-sensing response, when the
operating temperature increases to 100 °C. As the operating temperature
increases from 130 to 160 °C, the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sensor exhibits
the highest response, and the ZnO/rGO-1 nanocomposite also shows an
increasing NO2-sensing response (Figure 6c,d). When the operating temperature increases
to 200 °C, as shown in Figure 6e, the pure ZnO, ZnO/rGO-1, and ZnO/rGO-1.5 samples
show a NO2-sensing response approaching to the ZnO/rGO-0.5
sample. From Figure 6, we can see that a small amount of rGO highly improves the NO2-sensing property of the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sensor at a low operating
temperature (i.e., 70 °C), whereas the pure ZnO sensor shows
a low NO2-sensing response testing at 70–200 °C.
However, excessive rGO can reduce the NO2-sensing response
of ZnO/rGO samples (Figure S6). We compared
the NO2-sensing response (Ra/Rg) of the ZnO/rGO-x samples (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) as a function of operating
temperature (Figure S2). The NO2-sensing of the pure ZnO sample and ZnO/rGO-x showed
a trend of rising first and then decreasing with the increase of operating
temperature. The response of the pure ZnO sample is much lower than
that of the GO-doped ZnO samples, indicating that the addition of
GO nanosheets improved the gas-sensing properties especially at a
low operating temperature.

Figure 6 NO2-sensing curves of the ZnO/rGO
nanocomposites (ZnO/rGO-x, x = 0,
0.5, 1, 1.5) at different operating temperatures: (a) 70, (b) 100,
(c) 130, (d) 160, and (e) 200 °C.

Because the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sample shows the best NO2-sensing response, we compare their R–t curves under various operating temperatures (Figure S3). The optimum operating temperature
is 130–160 °C, and the NO2-sensing response
operating at 130 °C reaches a summit of 62. We investigated the
cycling stability of the ZnO/rGO-0.5 nanocomposite upon exposure to
NO2 with various concentrations (0.1–50 ppm) operating
at 130 °C. Figure 7 shows the typical R–t and
(Ra/Rg)–CNO2 curves of the ZnO/rGO-0.5 samples.
The ZnO/rGO sensors show an obvious response to NO2 with
a low concentration of 0.1 ppm. The response (Ra/Rg) of the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sensor
shows a quadratic function relation with the concentration of NO2 (CNO2/ppm): Ra/Rg = 5 + 5.38CNO20.6 (R2 = 0.998).

Figure 7 (a) R–t curve of the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sensor exposure to NO2 gases
with various concentrations (0.01–50 ppm) operating at 130
°C; (b) experimental and fitting plots of response (Ra/Rg) vs concentration of
NO2 gas for the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sensor operating at 130 °C.

We calculated the response and
recovery times according to their R–t response curves, as shown in Figure S4. Figure S4a shows the response
and recovery times of the ZnO/rGO sensors upon exposure to 50 ppm
NO2 at 130 °C, according to their R–t curves in Figure 6c. Their response times are less than 17
s, and their recovery times are 16–66 s. It is notable that
the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sample exhibits the shortest response/recovery time
(less than 20 s at 130 °C). The response and recovery times (Figure S4b,c) of the pure ZnO and ZnO/rGO-0.5
sensors operating at 130 °C are calculated according to the R–t curves in Figure 7a. We see that the response times of pure
ZnO nanocrystals up to 93 s at a low NO2 gas concentration,
and the response time is shortened as the NO2 gas concentration
increases. The response time of the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sample is much less
than the pure ZnO sample, and the effect of the NO2 concentration
on the response time (approximately 20 s) is weaker when the NO2 gas concentration is above 1 ppm. The recovery time of the
pure ZnO sample exceeded 40 s upon exposure to NO2 gas
because of its low desorption rate. Compared with the pure ZnO sensor,
the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sensor shows a relatively short recovery time (Figure S4b,c).

sensor to VOCs, CO, H2, H2S, and SO2 was also checked. Figure 8a shows the typical R–t curves with a 50 ppm gas or vapor at 130 °C. This sensor shows
a higher and more rapid response to NO2 than the other
gases. Figure 8b compares
the response upon exposure to these gases. The histogram clearly shows
that the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sensor has an excellent selective response to
NO2 gas.

sensor upon exposure to various types of vapors/gases (50 ppm) operating
at 130 °C.

Low gas concentration
detection is a good performance of gas-sensing materials. The experimental
conditions allow the detection gas concentration to be 10 ppb. At
an operating temperature of 130 °C, we tested the response of
ZnO/rGO-0.5, p-ZnO/rGO-0.5, and pure ZnO to NO2 gas at
a concentration of 10 ppb, as shown in Figure 9a. The pure ZnO curve is straight, which
does not respond to NO2 gas at low concentrations; when
rGO is doped to ZnO, the composite responds to low-concentration NO2 gas; the ZnO/rGO composites synthesized by the ultrasonic
spray method have better response to low concentration NO2 gas, and the response value is about four times that of the ZnO/rGO
composite synthesized by the precipitation method. The doping of rGO
is the key factor for the gas-sensitive material’s response
to NO2 gas. The ultrasonic spray method changes the morphology
of the material, forming a large specific surface area and a large
number of active sites, thereby increasing the response of ZnO/rGO
composites for NO2 gas.

Figure 9 (a) R–t curve of ZnO/rGO-0.5 (A), p-ZnO/rGO-0.5 (B), and ZnO (C)
for NO2 gas response at a concentration of 10 ppb; (b)
comparisons of the responses of the ZnO/rGO-0.5 sensor obtained by
different synthetic methods: ultrasonic spray and traditional precipitation.

In order to demonstrate the advantage
of the ultrasonic spray method in the synthesis of gas-sensing active
materials of ZnO/rGO, Figures 9b and S5 compare the NO2-sensing performance of the sensors based on ZnO/rGO-0.5 (by ultrasonic
spray) and p-ZnO/rGO-0.5 (by traditional precipitation) from a low
concentration of 0.5 ppm to a high concentration of 50 ppm operating
at 130 °C. The responses of the ZnO/rGO-0.5 and p-ZnO/rGO-0.5
sensors increase with the increase in gas concentration. However,
the p-ZnO/rGO-0.5 sensor shows a much weaker response than the ZnO/rGO-0.5
sensor. The enhancement in the NO2-sensing performance
of the ZnO/rGO-0.5 nanocomposite synthesized by the ultrasonic spray
method should be attributed to its higher surface area and a more
porous microstructure.

Possible Mechanism of ZnO/rGO Sensors to
NO2 Gas
The ZnO/rGO-0.5 sample with a small amount
of rGO (i.e., 0.5%) exhibits a much higher and quicker response to
NO2 gas than the pure ZnO nanocrystals. We try to understand
the possible reason on the basis of the synergetic effect of ZnO and
rGO. The ZnO nanorods behave as the key sensing material, and rGO
nanosheets serve as highly conductive channels.

The ZnO/rGO
nanocomposite obtained here consists of a majority of ZnO nanorods
covered by a small number of rGO nanosheets. A typical Schottky junction
between ZnO and rGO can be formed because of their suitable difference
of work function, as shown in Figure 10a. As an n-type semiconductor, the gas-sensing mechanism
of ZnO-based sensors involves the adsorption of oxygen species in
air,72 and then the resistance changes
before and after being exposed to a target gas.73−75 GO can enhance
the specific surface area of the ZnO/rGO active materials (see Figure 5) and promote the
adsorption of oxygen species and target gases. The resistance of the
ZnO/rGO sensor is influenced by the adsorption of oxygen species.
In the air, the oxygen species adsorbed on the ZnO/rGO surface experiences
a series of reactions (see eq 1).76 At an elevated operating temperature,
the equilibria shift to the right. The resistance of a ZnO/rGO sensor
exhibits a platform value because the oxygen captures electrons from
ZnO/rGO to form a space-charge layer (Figure 10b). When the sensors are exposed to an oxidizing
target gas such as nitrogen dioxide, the interaction between the oxidizing
gas and the electron on the surface of the sensors generates adsorbed
nitrogen dioxide gas molecules that can be represented as eq 2.77 Because NO2 has a higher electron affinity (2.28 eV)
than the pre-adsorbed oxygen (0.43 eV), the adsorbed NO2 molecules can capture the remaining electrons of O– and O2– ions absorbed on the surface
of the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites to produce O–, O2– ions and nitric monoxide, as shown in eqs 3 and 4.78 During the above process, the carriers (i.e.,
electrons) of the ZnO/rGO nanocomposite participate in the reactions,
and then result in a lack of carriers to further enlarge the thickness
of the depletion layer, forming a higher resistance state, as shown
in Figure 10c. 1   2   3   4  

Figure 10 Possible mechanism of
the ZnO/rGO nanocomposite for NO2 sensing. (a) Typical
Schottky junction between ZnO and rGO can be formed because of their
suitable difference of work function. (b) Oxygen captures electrons
from ZnO/rGO and forms a space-charge layer. (c) ZnO/rGO is exposed
to NO2 gas, enlarging the depletion layer and forming a
higher resistivity state.

The work function of ZnO is 4.1 eV, close to its conduction
band,79,80 and the work function of rGO is about 4.75
eV.35,36 This energy band structure exhibits some
similarity to the semiconductor/metal heterojunction (Figure 10a).37 In the contacted ZnO/rGO junction (Figure 10b), electrons will go from ZnO to rGO to
form an equilibrium at the Fermi level, forming a Schottky junction
in the ZnO/rGO interface. As NO2 molecules react with ZnO/rGO,
electrons transfer from ZnO/rGO to NO2, forming an increase
of the Schottky barrier (Figure 10c). As a result, a sharp rise in the resistance of
the ZnO/rGO nanocomposite occurs because of the difficulty for the
electrons to flow and pass through the Schottky barrier.

The
selective gas-sensing property of the ZnO/rGO nanocomposite to NO2 at a low operating temperature can be associated with the
higher NO2 adsorption and oxidation ability.81,82 At a low operating temperature, the adsorbed oxygen exists as O2– and O–,76 and the reducing gases (e.g., H2, H2S, and CH4) cannot react with O2– and O– because of their low reactivity. However
for the case of electrophilic NO2, it directly captures
free electrons from ZnO/rGO via the reactions (eqs 3 and 4). This point
may account for the selective response of the ZnO/rGO sensor to NO2 at a low temperature.

In the ZnO/rGO nanocomposite,
the conduction path is mainly controlled by ZnO nanorods because of
the small amount of rGO, but the addition of rGO obviously influences
the electrical transport properties and the microstructure of ZnO/rGO
nanocomposites. All in all, we can understand the possible reasons
why and how the rGO nanosheets influence the gas-sensing performance
of the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites from several aspects. First, the addition
of rGO changes the morphology of ZnO nanocrystals from a sheetlike
shape to rodlike one (Figure 4), forming a wrapped ZnO/rGO structure which improves the
NO2-sensing response. Second, some micro-area conductive
networks and rGO/ZnO Schottky junctions accelerate electric transfer
to promote the low-temperature NO2 detection. Third, the
method of ultrasonic spray is the key to synthesize the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites
with a high specific surface area and unique porous structure (Figures 4 and 5). The novel ultrasonic spray method can make rGO nanosheets
and ZnO nanorods fully contact and combine one another to form efficient
rGO/ZnO Schottky junctions, which provide more active sites for the
detection of NO2 and other gases (or vapors).

Conclusions
In this work, a novel USS method has been developed to synthesize
ZnO/rGO nanocomposites with unique core/shell Schottky junctions.
The gas ZnO/rGO sensors exhibit a highly selective response to nitrogen
dioxide with a low concentration (ppb-/ppm-levels) operating a low
temperature of 70–130 °C. Comparing the gas-sensing performance
of the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites obtained by ultrasonic spray and traditional
precipitation, the ultrasonic spray method has highly promoted the
gas-sensing performance of the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites. The possible
reasons for this promotion have been attributed to the formation of
ZnO/rGO Schottky junctions and the effective regulation in their microstructures
(i.e., specific surface area, porous structure, and interface). The
ultrasonic spray method has been proved to be an efficient strategy
to synthesize multiphase and multicomponent nanocomposites with controllable
micro-area interfaces and morphologies for the high-performance applications
in gas-sensing and other functional devices.

Experimental Section
Chemical
Reagents and Setups
All chemical reagents were of analytical
grade and used as received without further purification. Zinc nitrate
hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O)
and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were obtained from Wind Boat Chemical
Reagent Technology Co. Ltd (Tianjin, China). GO was purchased from
Huicheng Graphene Technology Application Co. Ltd (Wuxi, China). Deionized
water was used in the experiments. An ultrasonic sprayer (XO-1800W,
Nanjing Sino Instrument Manufacturing Co. Ltd, China) and a freeze
dryer (FD8-3, SIM International Group Co. Ltd, USA) were used in the
synthesis.

Synthesis of ZnO2/rGO Samples
ZnO/rGO nanocomposites were prepared via an ultrasonic spray-assisted
hydrothermal process (Figure 1). The mass ratio of GO to ZnO was theoretically designed
to be 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5%, and the resulting samples were named ZnO,
ZnO/rGO-0.5, ZnO/rGO-1, and ZnO/rGO-1.5, respectively. Typically,
1 g/L of GO aq solution was prepared by dispersing 100 mg of GO in
100 mL of H2O with ultrasonic treatment for 6 h; meanwhile,
0.15 mol/L of Zn(NO3)2 aq solution was prepared
by dissolving 44.62 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in 1000 mL of H2O. After the above GO (6.15 mL)
and Zn2+ solution (100 mL) were mixed by magnetic stirring
for about 3 h, the GO/Zn2+ mixture obtained was transferred
into a metering pump (20 rpm) which flowed to the ultrasonic spray
nozzle. A three-necked flask with a KOH solution (pH = 13.5, 50 mL)
was used as the reactor to which the GO/Zn2+ mixture was
injected via the ultrasonic-spray manner. The three-necked flask was
kept in an ice bath and magnetically stirred for 2 h. The resulting
GO/Zn(OH)2 suspension was finally transferred into a Teflon-lined
steel autoclave (100 mL), which was heated at 180 °C for 12 h.
The solids were collected by filtration and washing four times using
water and ethanol. The as-obtained solid was then freeze-dried and
the ZnO/GO-0.5 nanocomposite was synthesized. The other ZnO/GO samples
with various GO contents were prepared by a similar process.

For purposes of comparison, ZnO with 0.5% of GO was also synthesized
via a traditional precipitation method, and the resulting sample was
named p-ZnO/GO-0.5. The precipitation method just did not involve
the ultrasonic spray process and the other steps were similar to the
ultrasonic spray-assisted hydrothermal process.

Characterization
of ZnO/rGO Samples
Raman spectra were recorded on a LabRAM
HR Evolution spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, France) using the 633
nm line as the excitation source at room temperature. XRD patterns
were recorded on a D/MAX 2500 XRD diffractometer (Rigaku) with a Cu
Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). XPS spectra were performed
on an ESCALAB 250xi spectroscope (Thermo Scientific Ltd., England)
using an Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation source. The SEM and TEM
images were recorded by SEM (JSM-7001F JEOL, Japan) and TEM (Tecnai
G2 F20 S-TWIN, FEI, USA). The specific surface areas were tested on
an ASAP 2460 (Micromeritics, USA) machine at a liquid nitrogen temperature
of −196 °C.

Gas-Sensing Test of ZnO/rGO Nanocomposites
The gas sensors using the ZnO/rGO nanocomposites as active materials
were fabricated according to the above work. The ZnO/rGO nanocomposites
were first mixed with a small amount of ethanol to form the paste
in an agate mortar. Then, the as-obtained ZnO/rGO pastes were brush-coated
onto the surface of Al2O3 microtubes with Au
electrodes. After the ZnO/rGO coatings were air-dried, the coating
process was repeated until a continuous coating was formed. Each ZnO/rGO-coated
Al2O3 microtube was then fixed to the special
pedestal with six poles by welding the four Pt electrodes to four
poles of the pedestal. A heating coil (Ni–Cr) was then inserted
through the Al2O3 microtube and its two ends
were welded with the other two poles of the pedestal. A schematic
diagram of the ZnO/rGO sensor was shown in Figure 1. The sensors with pure ZnO nanocrystals
were fabricated used a similar process. The gas-sensing tests were
conducted on a WS-30A system from Zhengzhou Winsen Electronics Technology
Co., Ltd (Zhengzhou, China). NO2 was used as the target
gas to evaluate the gas-sensing performance of the ZnO/rGO sensors.
To investigate the selectivity of the ZnO/rGO sensors, some organic
vapors (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and acetone), H2, SO2, H2S, and CO were also used as the target-sensing
substances. The target gases were sampled using a syringe-like sampler
with a volume range of 0.1–900 μL. According to the densities
of liquid substances and the chamber volume, the concentrations (0.01–50
ppm) of the target substances were calculated. The relative humidity
(RH) was 35% and the working temperatures were 70–200 °C.
The ZnO/rGO sensor (R) was connected in series with
the load resistor (R0) with a known resistance,
and a source voltage (U0) of 5 V was loaded
on the circuit. The system recorded the voltage (U) loaded on R0, and the resistance (R) of the ZnO/rGO sensor can be therefore calculated according
to eq 5. For a reducing
gas (or vapor) and an n-type semiconductor sensor, the sensor response
(Sr) is defined as Ra/Rg, where Ra is the baseline resistance in air and Rg is the resistance in target gas, as shown in eq 6. The sensor response (Sr) is defined as Rg/Ra, as shown in eq 7, for an oxidizing gas and an n-type semiconductor.
The response time (τres) is defined as the time required
to reach 90% of the final response upon target gas exposure. Similarly,
the recovery time (τrec) is defined as the time interval
over which the sensor response drops to 10% of the stabilized response
in the target gas when placed in clean air. 5   6   7
