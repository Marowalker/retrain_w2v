This article reports
a coupled computational experimental approach
to design small molecules aimed at targeting genetic cardiomyopathies.
We begin with a fully atomistic model of the cardiac thin filament.
To this we dock molecules using accepted computational drug binding
methodologies. The candidates are screened for their ability to repair
alterations in biophysical properties caused by mutation. Hypertrophic
and dilated cardiomyopathies caused by mutation are initially biophysical
in nature, and the approach we take is to correct the biophysical
insult prior to irreversible cardiac damage. Candidate molecules are
then tested experimentally for both binding and biophysical properties.
This is a proof of concept study—eventually candidate molecules
will be tested in transgenic animal models of genetic (sarcomeric)
cardiomyopathies.

Introduction
This paper describes
a recently developed approach to identify
drug candidates that are able to ameliorate the effects of disease-causing
mutations in the cardiac thin filament (CTF). This complex multi-component
system is largely responsible for the regulation of cardiac contraction
and relaxation. Point mutations in this component of the cardiac sarcomere
are well known to cause both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies
in patients.1−3 At present, treatment of these diseases is largely
limited to symptom palliation. Biophysical understanding of drug action
in these diseases and heart failure is in the early stages. One provocative
example is the study of omecamtiv mecarbil.4 Here, the drug was determined to have almost the opposite effect
on the thick filament myosin as was expected. One other case of a
molecularly targeted drug is MYK-461 that is designed to effect sarcomere
energetics.5,6 Targeted drug therapies have proven difficult
to design for genetic cardiomyopathies given the long-time course
of the disease development (often decades). Modification thus must
be brought about by biophysical changes at the level of the sarcomere.
The approach described in this paper employs a recently described
all atom model of the CTF (Figure 1) that allows exposure of biophysical insults to the
CTF;7,8 methods to screen and dock potential drug
candidates followed by all atom molecular dynamics simulations to
check for repair of the damage to function. We experimentally validate
our computational results using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This in silico followed
by an in vitro approach will eventually be followed by transgenic
in vivo animal studies, and we feel this paradigm represents an unexplored
approach to the development of treatment for an unmet need in a complex
but not uncommon disorder. The approach is viable for any of the hundreds
of mutations in the CTF that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and
dilated cardiomyopathy . In addition, the initial computational phases
of the approach are fairly high throughput and essentially no cost.

subunit and cTnT–TM overlap region that will be crucial to
this work are shown in the overall figure and in expanded versions
above. The mutation site on TM is indicated as green balls.

We will describe the application
of the methodology to a specific
mutation in the TM component of the CTF. An important region of the
CTF is the TNT1 domain of cTnT and overlap of the C-terminal end of
one TM and N-terminal end of the next TM.7,9,10 It modulates the cooperative activation
of the myofilament. One of the known human cardiomyopathic mutations
linked to DCM within this region is the TM Asp230Asn (D230N) mutation.
This mutation causes a compaction of the cTnT–TM overlap region
accompanied by an increased cooperativity (decreased flexibility)
of the Tm filament.7,10,11 A detailed description of the TM D230N mutation from molecular dynamics
studies and experiments has been previously presented.7,10 (We note that the computational and experimental model are both
chosen to have mutant amino acid residues in both chains of the TM
dimer. This is done to create interpretable experimental results and
then to match the calculations to the experimental model). Various
studies have shown that structural effects of mutations within the
CTF can propagate over long distances and cause changes in the global
flexibility and CTF structure.8,12−14 Therefore, one should ask if drugs used to treat cardiomyopathies
also could have similar influence over long distances from a drug
binding site on the dynamic and structural properties of the CTF.

The mechanism of drug binding to the CTF remains largely opaque.
Past studies of drug-modulated calcium binding affinities show that
drugs bind within the cTnC subunit.15−27 The most commonly used models in the experimental and theoretical
approaches include only residues of N-lobe of the cTnC subunit (residues
1–90) with a small representation of the inhibitory region
of the cTnI subunit (residues 144–163). The use of fragments
to study drug binding can be misleading as local models do not allow
the prediction of the effects of drugs on the dynamic and structural
nature of the CTF over long distances. Such “allosteric action
at a distance” has been central in our published work to detect
potential “molecular off target” effects. In the current
study, unrestricted search throughout the entire thin filament has
allowed us to locate a new drug-binding pocket within the core region
of the cTn complex. Again, the most likely binding site is found in
the TnC core region. This is then followed by detailed ligand docking
studies, molecular dynamics analysis of the effects of drug binding
on the mutant thin filament, and finally in vitro experimental evaluation
of potential new drugs.

Results
Binding locations evaluated
using the Schrödinger SiteMap28 program
revealed a new binding pocket between
N-lobe and C-lobe of the cTnC subunit. The Schrödinger Glide29 program was used to perform docking studies
for variety of ligands from ZINC15 database30 to the binding pocket between the N and C lobes of cTnC (for details
see Experimental Materials and Methods section).
As a result of the initial docking studies of the TM D230N mutant,
a set of eight ligands with the best average Glide extra precision
(XP) docking scores were chosen for the initial molecular dynamics
(MD) trials. The first metric employed to test for putative drug effectiveness
was the distance in the overlap region between the cTnT and TM chains.
As reported previously, this corresponds to the average distance between
residues 94–133 of cTnT and the center of the TM coiled coil.7 A candidate drug is thus identified as one that
restores the overlap distance in a mutant to be similar to that of
the WT. This winnowed the number of tested ligands to three. The code
names and the structures of the final three ligands, their names,
and docking scores are presented in Figure 2. We initially computed the average distances
in the cTnT–TM overlap region. This was computed as a distance
of the centers of mass of the helices of TM and TnT. Errors are calculated
as the standard error of the means. The WT average distance is 19.9
± 0.2 Å, and the D230N CTF without drug was previously found
to be 18.5 ± 0.1 Å7 The results
with drug candidates bound are 19.0 ± 0.2, 21.6 ± 0.3, and
20.1 ± 0.1 Å, respectively, for the TM D230N systems with
the Z01, Z06, and Z08 ligands. Thus, Z01 was found to only partially
relieve the compaction in the overlap region that results in the disease
state, but we used it to test our binding predictions experimentally,
employing ITC to directly measure the binding affinity (Kd) and enthalpy (ΔH) of Z01 in vitro. ITC is a highly sensitive assay for the characterization
of the fundamental driving forces of molecular binding reactions.
Given the similarity in the predicted docking scores for the Z01 compound, we expected there to be little difference
in its binding affinity in vitro for either the WT or D230N CTF (Figure 2). Indeed, as our
model predicted, there was no significant difference in the binding
affinity of Z01 to the WT (2.9 ± 0.8 μM)
or D230N (3.5 ± 0.4 μM) CTF (Figure 3 and Table 1). Thus, while Z01 did not meet the
criteria of alleviating TM/TnT helix compaction, it was included in
our ITC tests as a way to verify the accuracy of the binding algorithm.
Note that the enthalpy is reported as positive—this measures
the heat deposited in the environment, the negative of the binding
enthalpy.

with Z06. Mean values reported ± standard error
of the mean (SEM) with an N = 4–5 per group.
A student’s t-test was used to assess significance,
**p < 0.01 vs WT CTF + Z06.

We thus are left with two candidate
molecules (Z06 and Z08). First,
we evaluated the Z08 ligand because for this system,
we predicted an overlap distance
closer to the WT than in the case of the TM D230N-Z06. An important test however is to evaluate the effect of the drug
on the wildtype CTF. The vast majority of patients with disease-causing
mutations are heterozygous with differing degrees of mutant protein
expressed. Thus, potential deleterious effects on the WT protein that
comprise the CTF must be considered. Performing this test, we found
the average overlap distance for the WT-Z08 system
(17.0 Å) to be even further decreased than for the untreated
TM D230N mutant itself. Based on these observations, the Z08 ligand was excluded from further investigation. For the WT-Z06 system, simulation predicts an average cTnT–TM
overlap distance of 19.5 Å, which is almost identical to the
WT system. In other words, unlike the Z08 molecule,
the WT is largely unaffected by Z06. Additionally,
predictions of the average distances between cTnT and TM were confirmed
by detailed analysis of the cTnT–TM distances through the trajectories
(see Supporting Information Figures S6–S8).
The significant differences in the docking scores for the Z06 ligand between the TM D230N mutant and the WT systems
suggest that the Z06 ligand should bind much more
strongly to the TM D230N mutant than to the WT. All computational
predictions lead us to the consistent conclusions that Z06 was the best choice for the experimental trials. Therefore, the
binding affinity of Z06 to WT and D230N CTF was evaluated
experimentally using ITC. As the CTF docking studies predicted, Z06 bound to D230N CTF with a significantly higher affinity
compared to WT (Kd: 0.4 ± 0.07 μM
vs 2.7 ± 0.4 μM, respectively). Additionally, D230N CTF
binding to Z06 also had a significantly higher enthalpy
(ΔH) when compared to WT CTF binding Z06 (18.1 ± 2.0 kJ/mol vs 6.2 ± 0.9 kJ/mol respectively)
(Figure 3 and Table 1). The Z06 ligand is one of the metabolites of duloxetine, an antidepressant
drug. It is known that this molecule is not a biologically active
compound and does not bind to the neurotransporters that are the targets
of the parent molecule: serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.31

Figure 4 shows the
position of the Z06 ligand in the TM D230N and the
WT systems. Differences in Z06 placement within the
binding pocket are caused by differences in the side chain position
for the cTn residues. Of note, Z06 does not stay
stably bound in the “mutant induced site” in the absence
of mutation giving credence to the fact that this specific binding
is caused by mutation. On the other hand, upon mutation, the molecule
is bound stably in the indicated site for as long as we have ever
computed. Also, as a final test of the validity of our binding site
identification, we performed ITC on the binding of Z06 to the troponin complex alone. The binding constant was almost the
same [K was within the experimental error of that
for the full thin filament (2.13 ± 0.26 μM)]. Figure 5 shows a comparison
of the average structure over all trajectories for the TNT1/TM overlap
region for both the treated and untreated systems. For the TM D230N
mutant, the TNT1 region is both closer to the TM and its N-terminal
end is shifted slightly so as to be above the TM chain. The end result
is the decrease in the distance between the chains. In the TM D230N-Z06 system, the N-terminal end of TNT1 is slightly shifted
in the opposite direction as the D230N mutant alone as compared to
WT, and at the same time, we see an increase in curvature in TNT1
(above C-terminal end of TM). This change in the position of TNT1
yields a clear explanation as to why the average distance between
cTnT and TM is larger for the TM D230N-Z06 system
than in the untreated mutant. Importantly, most of the TNT1 region
of the WT-Z06 is in almost an identical position
as that of the WT. We emphasize that these are subtle changes—more
drastic changes induced by mutation would not be compatible with life
and would be expected to be embryonic lethal rather than the cause
of a disease that takes decades to develop.

Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values of Cα atoms
for
tropomyosin chains within the overlap region shows significant changes
in the flexibility of the region in the D230N mutant versus the WT
(see Figure 6). Previous
experiments have shown a significant increase in the cooperativity
of the C-end of the tropomyosin chain–N-end of the tropomyosin
chain (TMC–TMN) region for the TM D230N mutant7,10 that correlates well with the theoretical prediction of lower flexibility
of this region. Z06 ligand interactions with TM D230N
mutant were able to restore a more native flexibility of the TMC–TMN
overlap region to the WT level. Z06 interactions
with the WT caused drop in flexibility of this region to the level
from TM D230N mutant. Nevertheless, given that the Z06 affinity is much higher for the TM D230N mutant than for the WT,
the Z06 ligand should have a minimal effect on WT
thin filaments. We have also tested binding of the Z06 molecule independently via ITC to the troponin complex alone (i.e.
no actin and no tropomyosin) and to the full thin filament. The binding
constants were within experimental error, indicating that the molecule
does not bind strongly to either tropomyosin or to actin, and this
gives further credence that it binds in the only site identified—TnC.

WT-Z06 systems.

We coupled these in silico data to the experiment via DSC
to determine
the effect of bound Z06 on the thermal stability
and cooperativity (flexibility) of the CTF. (Note that lower flexibility
in this region translates to stiffer mechanical movement and stronger
transmission of the binding signal. This in turn is found experimentally
via non-linear Ca2+ versus force generation in isolated
cardiac muscle fiber studies.) An advantage of DSC for the study of
the CTF is its sensitivity in detecting the calorimetric events associated
with unfolding of well-characterized regions of the CTF including:
the denaturation of the individual termini of TM (TMN and TNC), the
TM–troponin (cTn) complex, cTn alone, as well as actin unfolding.3,4,32−34 The literature
cited shows that each event has a unique independent thermal signature
allowing an unambiguous assignment of specific unfolding events to
specific components of the thin filament. This was checked via melting
studies of individual components of the thin filament. Recently, the
effect of the TM D230N mutation on the thermal stability (Tm) of the N- and C-termini (TMN and TMC, respectively)
as well as its effect on the stability and cooperativity (full-width
half-max, fwhm, a surrogate of flexibility) of the fully reconstituted
CTF was published.7,10 Consistent with these data, our
results show that TM D230N increases the thermal stability (Tm °C) and increases the cooperativity (decreased
fwhm) of domain 2 (D2) of the thermal profile, an unfolding domain
that corresponds to the thermal denaturation of the TM–cTn
complex from actin (Figure 7 and Table 2). Specifically, we found that the thermal stability was 46.5 ±
0.09 TM D230N versus 46.2 ± 0.08 for TM WT and the fwhm of TM
D230N was decreased to 1.5 ± 0.06 from 1.9 ± 0.04 °C.
This confirms that the baseline effect of the mutation is to decrease
the flexibility of the crucial TM overlap.

a Thermal stability
(Tm °C) and cooperativity (fwhm,
°C) for TM WT
and TM D230N bound to Z06 values are reported as
mean ± SEM for calorimetric domain 2 (D2) which corresponds to
the thermal unfolding of the TM–cTn complex off of actin. There
was an N = 3–4 per group. A student’s t-test was used to assess significance, *p < 0.05 vs WT – Z06, **p < 0.01 vs WT – Z06, and #p < 0.05 vs D230N – Z06.

We expanded upon this to assess
the effect of Z06 binding to both WT and TM D230N
CTF. Of note, our data indicated
that Z06 increases the thermal stability of D2 for
both TM WT (46.6 ± 0.05 °C) and TM D230N (46.9 ± 0.07
°C) above that of unbound TM WT. This effect is explained by
a well-known phenomena in which protein thermal stability is increased
by ligand binding due to the equilibrium of binding and unfolding.35 Interestingly, despite this ubiquitous increase
in thermal stability, the fwhm of TM–cTn unfolding (a surrogate
of flexibility) for TM D230N-Z06 was significantly
increased (decreased cooperativity) from TM D230N levels to 1.8 ±
0.04 °C, indicating a significantly less rigid (or more flexible)
TM filament when Z06 is bound to TM D230N (Figure 7 and Table 2). While this is not a complete
recovery of flexibility to WT levels, it is an encouraging result
that agrees with our RMSF-predicted changes in the flexibility of
the TM-overlap region (Figure 6). Such improvement in the flexibility of the Tm filament could positively impact Tm regulatory function, thus improving cardiac function.

Conclusions
The treatment of genetic cardiomyopathies presents a major unmet
challenge in cardiac pharmacology. This paper presents a new approach
to the screening and eventual development of such treatment modalities.
Central to the approach is a direct connection of new theoretical
and experimental approaches. The molecules we present here are provided
as proof of concept. One ligand was found to largely relieve compaction
in the TM overlap region associated with increased CTF cooperativity
and the eventual development of DCM. In addition, this candidate molecule
was shown to significantly relieve the loss of flexibility in the
TM overlap region also indicated in the development of mutation induced
DCM.

The Z06 ligand acts as a bridge between
cTnC and
cTnI residues in addition to restoring the TM–cTnT interhelix
distances. Thus, this ligand has the potential to restore the ability
to transmit the calcium-binding signal from the cTnC subunit to the
other parts of the CTF system both by modulating cooperativity and
tuning of the cTnI functionality. It is only fair to discuss the limitations
of the approach. This methodology is focused on the thin filament.
We are proposing a method to hunt for drugs that treat that piece
of the cardiac machinery. It is entirely possible that the drugs found
in this way will bind elsewhere in the many thousands of proteins
in a human body and have unwanted side effects. Of course, this is
largely true for almost any drug candidate proposed. In addition,
the individual methods used to study the effect of this small molecule
could all be potentially subject to question. For example, the only
atomic information we have on the drug binding is computational, and
one may argue the molecule may be finding other binding sites. That
having been said, both experimental methodologies point to the same
conclusions as the computations—the drug binds and effects
the thin filament in ways that are potentially therapeutic. The next
step will be to test this and other candidate drugs in animal models.
This higher level of biological complexity can be studied in transgenic
animal models created in our group. In addition, other studies of
binding—such as NMR could be used to verify the exact binding
location.

Computational Methods
NAMD 2.9 software36 with the CHARMM27
force field was used to perform all MD simulations of the full atomistic
thin filament systems. The last slice from the equilibration steps
from earlier WT and TM D230N mutant structures7 was used as a starting point for docking studies. Schrödinger
SiteMap 4.128,37,38 was used to identify potential binding pockets within the cTn complex.
For this purpose, the Cartesian coordinates of each atom from the
cTnC subunit (residues 1–161), cTnI subunit (residues 1–210),
cTnT subunit (residues 120–287), TM (residues 100–265),
and calcium cations were imported into the Schrödinger Maestro
software.39 Each chain was verified with
the Protein Preparation Wizard40,41 to ensure that all
amino acids are consistent with the corresponding residues from the
initial NAMD PDB file. In the case of truncated segments (cTnT, TM),
all N-end and C-end residues were converted to their appropriate form.
Reduction of the size of the system was necessary because of the limit
of number of atoms that can be processed by Schrödinger SiteMap.
In addition, usage of TM chains prevents Schrödinger SiteMap
from identifying potential binding pockets in the area where interactions
between cTnT and TM are present.

Schrödinger SiteMap
was set-up to identify the top 20 binding
pockets with fine grids and at least 15 site points for each reported
binding pocket. As a result, 11–16 potential binding pockets
were identified. For each system, the top ranked binding pocket we
found was localized between N and C lobes of the cTnC subunit (see
the examples of the Schrödinger SiteMap surfaces in the Supporting Information). Therefore, in Schrödinger
Glide 7.342,43 software, the whole cTnC subunit was chosen
to generate a grid for further docking procedures.

The ZINC15
database30 has been chosen
as a source of ligands that contains millions of possible drug candidates.
From this, a large set of 3D ligand structures have been exported
with the following criteria: molecular weight from 450 Da to above
500+ Da (tranches: 450–500 Da, 500+ Da) and logP values below
5. The relatively high mass of ligands was chosen to be sure that
molecules are big enough to not fit in small gaps between different
chains but small enough to fit between cTnC lobes. Ligands from each
tranche have been prepared for docking in Schrödinger LigPrep
4.0 software44 with retention of chirality
and with the generation of all tautomers, ring conformations, and
possible ionization states by Schrödinger Epik 3.8 software45−47 at pH 7.0 ± 1.0. After this preparation step, each ligand set
has been subjected to a flexible high-throughput virtual screening
(HTVS) docking in Schrödinger Glide software to the binding
pocket within the TM D230N cTnC subunit. All docked ligands with Glide
docking scores below −6.0 have been re-docked with the standard
precision mode (SP) in Schrödinger Glide software to the same
binding pocket. Finally, after SP docking procedures, ligands with
Glide docking scores below −6.0 were re-docked with the extra
precision mode (XP)43 in Schrödinger
Glide software. The set of ligands with the best XP docking scores
were re-docked with the XP mode in the binding site within the hTnC
chain opposite side to cTnC in CTF model. The ligands with the best
average XP docking scores were selected for further MD simulations.
In order to test the accuracy of our docking procedure, we blindly
docked the known calcium sensitizer 2,4-difluorobiphenyl-4-yloxy acetic
acid to the binding pocket we find and we compare RMSD of the top
binding pose to that reported in the literature.48 The resulting structure had an RMSD when comparing to the
reported structure of 0.65 Å, indicating the viability of the
method.

The best ligand structures were exported from Schrödinger
Maestro to the pdb files and missing CHARMM parameters for chosen
ligands were assigned from the Multipurpose Atom-Typer for CHARMM
(MATCH) web server.49 In the next step,
ligands structures were merged with the corresponding CTF structures
(form the last slice of the equilibration) and re-solvated in Visual
Molecular Dynamics (VMD 1.92).50 We briefly
outline the prior MD methodology.

After solvation and addition
of counter-ions, each system (comprised
of roughly 5 million atoms) was minimized for 5000 steps with periodic
boundary conditions, particle mesh Ewald summation for electrostatics,
SHAKE for bonds involving hydrogen, and with van der Waals interactions
cut off at 12 Å. Each model was heated from 0 to 300 K with a
temperature increment of 1 K/ps and then simulated for additional
10 ps to ensure that the temperature is stable at 300 K. Next, 690
ps of equilibration with isothermal–isobaric conditions was
performed (Langevin piston set at 1 atm, Langevin thermostat set at
300 K). In the final step, three separate 10 ns MD productions runs
were performed with the same conditions as in the equilibration step
but with different randomly chosen velocity initialization seeds.
The average structures were created in the VMD1.92 and re-minimized
for 5000 steps in the continuum solvation model (water) in NAMD. RMSF
calculations and hydrogen bond counts were performed in VMD1.92. Average
distances between TM and TnT were calculated as the average of distances
between fictitious beads located at the center of mass of each helix.
The distance between cTnT and the two tropomyosin chains was averaged.

We note that the starting structure can significantly influence
MD results. As such, the three independent MD runs are intended to
provide a check on outlier results. While we have found such results
in some of our past studies, all results reported here are from the
initial three runs and are self-consistent.

Experimental Materials
and Methods
Protein Expression, Purification, and Reconstitution
Alanine–serine-tagged α-tropomyosin were expressed and
purified as previously described.3,4 The ala–ser
tag is used to mimic N-terminal acetylation and is necessary to promote
head-to-tail polymerization binding with actin and Tn.51 The D230N mutation was inserted into the WT
TM pET3D vector (provided by Dr. Wieczorek) via QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis (Stratagene). Human cardiac troponin proteins were expressed
and purified, and the recombinant cTn complex reconstitution was performed
in equimolar amounts as previously described.52 After reconstitution, TnT precipitate was separated via centrifugation
at 14 000 rpm for 20 min. Rabbit skeletal muscle was used to purify,
prepare, and polymerize filamentous actin as previously described
in the literature.53 G-actin was then extracted
from the acetone powder and prior to reconstitution of the thin filaments,
G-actin was polymerized to F-actin with a final salt concentration
of 50 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl2. To ensure complete polymerization
actin was thoroughly mixed and polymerized at room temperature for
1 h. Individual proteins were dialyzed in their appropriate buffer
systems (X3 change, >4 h), and protein concentrations were measured
using a Beckman Coulter DU-730 UV–vis spectrophotometer (extinction
coefficients were determined by the primary sequence of the protein).
Dialyzed proteins were reconstituted into thin filaments at a 3:3:7
Tn/Tm/actin molar ratio. The reconstituted thin filaments were incubated
on ice overnight prior to use.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
ITC measurements were
performed with a Nano ITC ultrasensitive titration calorimeter (TA
Instruments). Prior to reconstitution, thin filament proteins were
dialyzed into a buffer containing 10 mM MOPS, 140 mM KCl, 50 μM
CaCl2, 7 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaN3, and
100 μM DTT, pH 7.35. Z01 and Z06 ligands were brought up in ITC Buffer to a final concentration of
250 and 500 μM, respectively. A 2 μL injection of drug
(titrant) was delivered (30 injections) to the reaction cell over
with a 350 s interval between injections to allow complete equilibration.
The cell was stirred at 75 rpm to ensure rapid mixing and to minimize
protein shearing. The temperature was maintained at 20 °C. Raw
traces for each system were collected in quadruplicate. Traces were
analyzed via NanoAnalyze (TA Instruments). A titrant into buffer only
was run to account for the heat of dilution and was in agreement with
the last experimental injections at saturation. Thus, the average
heat of the final (5) injections was used to correct for the heat
of dilution. The heats of each experimental injection were integrated
and normalized to titrant and then plotted against the molar ratio
of the drug added to TF. TF concentrations were calculated based on
the total protein concentration and Tn complex concentration obtained
via UV spectrophotometry. The fitted curve provides a thermodynamic
description of the binding interaction via binding affinity (Kd) and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH).

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
A Nano DSC (TA Instruments)
was used to assay the thermal stability (or calorimetric profile)
of fully reconstituted CTFs (actin/Tm/cTn). The individual proteins
were dialyzed into a buffer containing 30 mM HEPES, 200 mM KCl, 50
μM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 200 μM Mg-ATP,
and 1 mM βME, pH 7.35. Thin filaments were reconstituted in
accordance with previous work by Kremneva et al.32 For each replicate, 600 μL of protein (CTF total
protein concentration between 1.85 and 1.9 mg/mL) was loaded into
the sample cell and heated from 25 to 75 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min
after an initial 600 s equilibration period (n =
3). A buffer versus buffer scan was also performed daily and applied
to background. The resultant calorimetric heating profile was fitted
via a 4-Gaussian distribution and analyzed using NanoAnalyze software
provided by TA Instruments.
