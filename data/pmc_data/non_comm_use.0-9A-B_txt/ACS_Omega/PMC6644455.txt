The rutile TiO2(110) surface
has long-served as a well-characterized,
prototypical transition-metal oxide surface used in heterogeneous
catalysis and photocatalytic water splitting. Naturally occurring
defects on this surface, called bridging-oxygen (BO) vacancies, are
important as they determine the overall reactivity of the surface.
Herein, we report a bias-dependent, scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) signature of the BO vacancies on TiO2(110): for sample
bias voltages past a threshold of +3 V, the bright vacancies are flanked
on either side (along the oxygen row) by two dark spots approximately
shaped like half-moons. The BO vacancies have a bright aspect below
the threshold bias also but are not surrounded by half-moon dark depressions.
Using generalized gradient approximation calculations with Hubbard
correction (GGA + U) for projected density of states
(DOS) and simulated STM images, we find that the bias-dependent STM
signature originates from (i) local DOS maxima of all BOs (lighter
background that occurs above the threshold bias) and (ii) the increased
separation between the first and second BO atoms neighboring the vacancy
which leads to an apparent dip between these neighboring oxygens.
These results offer a new striking example of the STM signature that
appears without switching the polarity of the bias. Similar approaches
can be employed for seeking distinguishing features on the surfaces
of other large band gap semiconductors and insulators.

1 Introduction
Titanium dioxide is a
prototypical transition-metal oxide widely
used in photocatalysis,1,2 heterogeneous catalysis,3 as well as in solar4,5 and sensing
technologies.6 Its most stable rutile TiO2 surface, (110), is a de facto playground for fundamental
investigations of reactivity of metal-oxide surfaces.7−10 The stoichiometric TiO2(110) exposes 5-fold coordinated
Ti atoms, bridging oxygens (BOs), and 4-fold coordinated oxygens.7 However, the surface is rarely stoichiometric,
as it contains naturally occurring BO vacancies.7,11 These
vacancies, whose coverage can be controlled by ion sputtering and
annealing, are important reactive sites for various adsorbates,1,7,11,12 and therefore critically affect most chemical reactions occurring
on the TiO2 surface. The BO vacancies may effectively change
the electronic structure of the surface, acting as electronic donors.7 Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) emerged as
a key means to determine reaction intermediates on the surface, and,
furthermore to give insight into the specific catalytic role played
by this surface.7,10−12 Using STM and
density functional theory (DFT) simulation approaches, the BO vacancies
have been differentiated from various adsorbates on the surface after
some initial confusion over their individual signatures.7,13−18 Over the last few decades, empty- and filled-state STM images (corresponding
to opposite bias polarity) have been used to seek distinguishing features
of electronic properties of surfaces,19,20 of various
reconstructions,21,22 or adsorbate structures.23,24 For example, contrast reversal is often associated with polarity
changes for surfaces with semiconducting behavior.19,20

In this article, we show that BO vacancies have an STM “fingerprint”
that occurs without changing the bias polarity, only its value: this
signature is the presence of two dark, half-moon-shaped spots flanking
the BO vacancy along the BO row, appearing when the positive sample
bias voltage exceeds +3.0 V. The dark spots are not observable below
this threshold bias. An unintended consequence of activating such
a high threshold could be that (some) adsorbates desorb from the surface
during scanning, thereby leaving only or mostly BO vacancies; if this
desorption effect becomes undesirable, it could be controlled by lowering
the tunneling current in STM imaging. Using DFT calculations in the
framework of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Hubbard
correction (+U), and DFT-simulated STM images, we
identify the origin of this BO vacancy fingerprint in STM. Specifically,
we find that for bias voltages past a threshold, the oxygen rows become
brighter and create contrast for the depressed surface 6-fold coordinated
Ti atoms that are closest to the vacancy. These results offer a new
striking example of the STM signature that appears without changing
the polarity of the bias but simply increasing it gradually until
(potentially) new STM features appear: as such, similar approaches
can be employed for analyzing distinguishing features on the surfaces
of other large band gap semiconductors and insulators.

2 Methods
2.1 Experimental Details
TiO2(110) single-crystal samples (obtained from Princeton Scientific
and Commercial Crystal Laboratories) were subjected to argon-ion sputtering
cycles, followed by annealing at ∼910 K; the thermally reduced
samples were subsequently cooled rapidly below 100 K, so as to retain
a significant population of BO vacancies on the surface.25,26 These vacancies were imaged using an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) cryogenic
STM system (Createc), operating at a temperature of 77 K and a pressure
below 10–11 Torr, in the constant current mode with
positive sample bias ranging from 1.0 to 4.0 V. Similar to other works,25−27 we have used electrochemically etched tungsten tips, annealed by
electron bombardment in UHV.

2.2 Computational Details
To investigate
the electronic structure and the STM images of rutile TiO2(110) surfaces with single vacancies, we have carried out DFT calculations
in the framework of the spin-dependent GGA, with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
exchange–correlation functional28 as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Software Package.29−31 We have modified the Hamiltonian by adding a Hubbard correction U on the Ti d-states to prevent spurious delocalized solutions.32 We use a value of U = 4.5 eV,
which was reported to lead to midgap states for BO vacancies,33 which is consistent with experimental findings.34 We have used projector-augmented pseudopotentials,31 a 500 eV plane-wave energy cutoff, and a 2 ×
2 × 1 Γ-centered grid for sampling the Brillouin zone during
structure relaxations. The slab structures in our simulations have
2 × 5 surface unit cells with dimensions of  and 5c = 14.85000 Å
along the [11̅0] and the [001] directions, respectively. The
slabs have 15 Å of vacuum and five O–Ti–O trilayers
total, with one BO atom removed from the upper and lower surfaces.
The middle trilayer is kept fixed, but all other atoms are relaxed
until the residual forces are smaller than 0.025 eV/Å. After
the structural relaxations, (partial) density of states (DOS) calculations
were performed and used for simulations of STM images via the Tersoff–Hamman
approach.35

3 Results
Figure 1 shows STM
images obtained for a sequence of bias voltages from 1.5 to 4.0 V,
for the same tunneling current of 1.3 nA. When inspecting scans performed
at different biases, we note that vacancies may sometimes hop along
the BO row, but this effect is rare and rapid, that is, it is not
significant on the time scale of the scan. At positive tunneling bias
values, the Ti rows on the rutile TiO2(110) surface appear
bright, while the O rows are dark; this is consistent with other experimental
reports8,9 for the row assignments on this surface.
At low bias voltages, each oxygen vacancy appears as a bright spot
with a diffuse halo around it (Figure 1a–c). However, as the bias voltage is increased
past 3.0 V, dark spots with a half-moon shape surround the vacancies
(Figure 1d–f).
This is a distinct, bias-dependent signature of the BO vacancy, which
has been overlooked in previous reports, typically using low biases
(below the 3.0 V threshold identified here).10,14 The origin of this STM signature of the oxygen vacancy has not been
investigated so far, and we are analyzing it here based on DFT calculations
compared with the experimental STM images.

Figure 1 (a–f) Empty-state
STM images of BO vacancies on the rutile
TiO2(110) surface for sample bias voltages from (a) 1.5
to (f) 4.0 V, at a tunneling current I = 1.3 nA.
The O and Ti rows are shown by the orange and yellow arrows, respectively.
Below a threshold of 3.0 V, the bright BO vacancies are surrounded
by diffuse bright areas, whereas for voltages above the threshold,
we observe half-moon-shaped dark spots (depressions) situated along
the BO row, on either side of the vacancies. There are four vacancies
circled by blue dashed lines, whose apparent height profiles are analyzed
in Figure 3.

We now describe the DFT calculations
at the level of GGA + U aimed at elucidating the
origin of the bias-dependent,
half-moon depressions around the BO vacancies. GGA + U is deemed to be a good compromise between the tractability of the
calculations and retaining a qualitatively correct description of
the midgap states pointed out in other works.14,33,34,36,37 The drawback is that at this level of theory, the
band gap itself is still ∼1 eV smaller than in experiments,33 which should reflect in a correspondingly smaller
threshold for the emergence of half-moon depressions in the STM simulations
(Figure 2). Indeed, Figure 2 shows that the dark
depressions in simulations start to appear at a bias of 2.0 eV, instead
of the experimental value of 3.0 V. Regardless of whether a vacancy
hops or not during STM scanning, its structure before and after the
jump remains the same; hence, simulations of the STM images of a static
BO vacancy in the unit cell are relevant for comparisons with experiments.
The simulated and experimental STM images of the single BO vacancy
are similar to each other (Figures 1 and 2). We have further analyzed
the simulated and experimental images of the BO vacancies in terms
of their apparent height on the surface. Figure 3 shows the height profiles along the BO rows for the four
vacancies marked in Figure 1, and the corresponding profile from the DFT simulations of
our 2 × 5 reduced TiO2(110) supercells. For easy comparison,
the height profiles were centered on the vacancy in all cases. As
seen in Figure 3, all
the curves (experimental and simulated) show the same locations of
the depressions around the vacancy. The contrasts of the simulated
and experimental STM images are different (Figure 3), which is likely due to the fact that the
STM simulations shown in Figure 2 are based on computed DOS and do not include any tip
effects.

Figure 2 DFT-simulated empty-state STM images. For voltages below 2.0 V,
there are no depressions around the vacancy [panels (a–c)].
For higher voltages, two dark spots appear along the BO row located
about 1.4c away from the center of the vacancy [panels
(d–f)]. Each panel shows a 2 × 5 surface cell (solid red
box) with a vacancy (red circle); for clarity, this cell is repeated
four times in the plane of the surface.

Figure 3 Apparent height profiles (red and blue curves) for the four BO
vacancies marked by dashed circles in Figure 1 and the corresponding profile from the DFT
simulations of a vacancy in a 2 × 5 surface cell (black curve).
For easy comparison, all apparent height curves have been centered
with their maximum on the exact location of the vacancy. All curves
correspond to a bias voltage of 4.0 V and show similar locations of
the depressions around the vacancy (1.4c–1.6c).

This robust presence
of the apparent depressions around vacancies
above a certain threshold bias (2.0 V in the DFT simulations) suggests
that the GGA + U approach can be used as a means
to determine the physical origin of the bias dependence observed in
experiments. Toward this goal, we start by calculating and plotting
the DOS for the d-states of all Ti atoms and the p-states of all O
atoms in the simulation cell. The DOS plots are depicted in Figure 4 and show that there
is only one dominant peak for the d-states of Ti atoms past the DFT
threshold of 2.0 V. The DFT-simulated STM images include states within
a desired bias voltage range above the Fermi level; hence, the peak
between 2.0 and 2.5 V is included for simulations in Figure 2d–f, all performed for
a bias greater than 2.0 V.

Figure 4 Calculated DOS for the d states of all Ti atoms
and all O atoms
(p states only) in the supercell. The two spin polarizations are shown
as curves above and below the horizontal axis.

Next, we focus on identifying which particular atoms in the
simulation
cell are responsible for the DOS peak between 2.0 and 2.5 V shown
in Figure 4. We investigate
the atoms that are near the BO vacancy, specifically the 5-fold coordinated
atoms at the vacancy (a), the BO to which it is bonded (b), the next
Ti atom (c) along the oxygen row, and the bridge-O atom (d) located
two sites away from the vacancy. These atoms are shown in the inset
of Figure 5a. The site-projected
DOS in Figure 5 shows
that the most pronounced peak occurs for the Ti (c) atoms in the 2–2.5
V range, while the 5-fold Ti (a) atoms have more maxima of similar
strength in a wider bias range. The O (b) and O (d) atoms range also
have clear maxima between 2 and 2.5 V (Figure 5). With this identification of the atoms
responsible for the DOS peak between 2.0 and 2.5 V, we perform angular
momentum projections of the DOS associated with Ti (c).

Figure 5 (a–d)
Site-projected DOS for selected atoms along the BO
row. Inset: (a) 5-fold coordinated Ti, (c) 6-fold coordinated Ti,
and two BOs (b,d). Only d (p) states are included for the Ti (O) atoms.
Ti (c), O (b), and O (d) have peaks between 2.0 and 2.5 V, which ultimately
lead to the observed depressions around the vacancy, enabled by geometric
relaxation effects that increase the separation between O (b) and
O (d).

Figure 6a shows
the angular momentum-projected d-states of this atom. The most pronounced
DOS maximum occurs for the dz2 state of Ti(c), which has a lobe along the surface
normal z and hence should lead to a bright spot strictly
above the Ti (c) atom situated 1.5c away from the
vacancy. However, instead of a bright spot, there is a dark half-moon-shaped
spot at ∼1.4c away from the center of the
vacancy, that is, just above the Ti (c) atom (Figures 2 and 3). This seeming
contradiction can be understood by plotting concomitantly the simulated
STM image and the charge density associated with all atoms and all
angular momenta for the bias range of 2–2.5 V (Figure 6b). Figure 6b reveals that even though there is indeed
a local maximum of the charge density above Ti (c) (associated mainly
with dz2, Figure 6a), this maximum
is not so pronounced as to overcome the fact that the Ti (c) atom
lies ∼1.34 Å lower than the O (b) and O (d) oxygens at
the surface. One may wonder why there is no such pronounced apparent
dip in the STM images between any other BOs that are next to each
other on the surface: the reason is that the distance between O (b)
and O (d) is larger (due to asymmetric relaxation toward the vacancy,
see inset in Figure 5) than the nominal value between two neighboring BO on the stoichiometric
surface, thus “allowing” the STM tip to record a sharper
and wider dip between them (Figure 6b).

Figure 6 (a) Angular momentum-projected d-states corresponding
to the 6-fold
coordinated Ti that is closest to the vacancy along the BO row [atom
Ti (c)]. The dyz projection
is small and omitted for clarity. (b) Spatial charge density (arbitrary
units) corresponding to the states (all atoms, all angular momenta)
in the 2.0–2.5 V energy window above the Fermi level. In this
window, the pronounced maxima localized above the vacancy and above
two BO atoms (c and 2c away from
the vacancy) on one side of it lead to the dark spot above Ti (c).

4 Discussion
Below
the threshold voltage, the Ti (a) atom has extended maxima,
while the O atoms (b,d) do not have significant DOS maxima that would
contribute strongly to the STM image (Figure 5); therefore, the dark half-moon spots would
not appear below the threshold (Figures 1 and 2). To confirm
this, we plot simulated STM images using only certain voltage windows
that do not necessarily start from the Fermi level. These simulations
are not meant to correspond to experiments the way those in Figure 2 do, but rather to
isolate the contributions of different energy windows below and above
the threshold level of 2.0 V. Indeed, below the 2.0 V threshold, there
are no pronounced depressions (Figure 7a). The dark half-moon spots mainly originate from
states in the 2–2.5 V window (Figure 7b), and, to a smaller extent, from states
beyond this energy window (Figure 7c). An important aspect contributing to the appearance
of dark depressions just above Ti (c) (Figure 6b) is that the BO rows become brighter when
p states within 2–2.5 V are sampled (Figure 7b), hence creating contrast for the half-moon
dark spots above Ti (c). This is borne out in experiments as well,
where we see the oxygen rows “light up” when the bias
is past the experimental threshold (compare, e.g., Figure 1a with 1d). The results in Figure 7 also indicate that the midgap states14 do not contribute to the half-moon depressions (dark spots) around
the vacancy; this is easily understood because the “responsible”
bias window of 2.0–2.5 V is completely within the conduction
band.

Figure 7 Simulated empty-state STM images obtained from states for selected
bias intervals. The half-moon depressions show clearly for the 2.0–2.5
V window. The 2.5–4 V window also leads to depressions but
with significantly lower contrast corresponding to the smaller density
of Ti d states at biases beyond 2.5 V (Figure 4).

The results presented in Figure 1a–c are consistent with numerous other
reports
in the literature that show bright Ti rows, dark BO rows, and bright
BO vacancies in STM at positive biases of 1–2 V.8−10,18 In addition, we carried out STM
scans at larger bias voltages, up to 4 V: this is how we uncovered
the hallmark, half-moon depressions that flank the BO vacancies. Analysis
of the projected DOS has shown that the bias-dependent STM signature
originates from DOS maxima of the 5-fold coordinated Ti atoms next
to the vacancy and two BO atoms on each side of it. As bias-dependent
threshold behavior is investigated for a BO vacancy or adsorbate on
the surface, it is important to check at the same time for the possible
desorption of various species on the surface. For example, STM scans
carried out at sample bias >3 V would desorb H atoms from the surface,8,38 but would not affect too much the native BO vacancies which may
only undergo sporadic hops along the BO row. In cases where desorption
of an adsorbate requires a minimal dose of tunneling electrons (i.e.,
is controlled by the electron flux/current rather than the energy),
the desorption (of H, or of other adsorbates) can be suppressed by
lowering the tunneling current. An investigation of the multiple species
on the surface with (sufficiently) different desorption biases and/or
different thresholds for the onset of adsorbate-specific STM signatures
may be useful. Another interesting aspect for future work is the study
of bias-dependent STM signatures for large adsorbates that potentially
allow for spanning wide bias intervals without desorption.

5 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported a bias-dependent
STM signature
for BO vacancies on the well-studied TiO2(110) surface:
for positive sample bias voltages above +3.0 V in experiments (or
2.0 V in GGA + U calculations), half-moon-shaped
apparent depressions appear along the oxygen row at ∼1.4c away from the center of the vacancy. By studying the DOS
projected on angular momentum components for selected atoms, we found
that the origin of this characteristic STM signature of the BO vacancy
is a high density of d states for the 5-fold coordinated Ti atoms
at the vacancy and of p states for the O atoms around the vacancy
(c and 2c away): this high DOS occurs
primarily in the 3–3.5 V bias interval (2–2.5 V in GGA
+ U simulations). Although there is a local DOS maximum
at the 6-fold coordinated surface Ti closest to the vacancy, this
Ti lies sufficiently below the BO atoms that it appears dark despite
the local dz2 DOS maximum. Midgap states do not contribute to the reported bias-dependent
STM signature.

The current results on bias-dependent signature
of defects on the
surface are expected to contribute in cases where there is potential
ambiguity in distinguishing different adsorbates and/or defects on
surfaces. For example, in the past, there has been some confusion
between the signature of hydroxyls (OH) and vacancies on TiO2(110):13 while this was resolved by studying,
comparatively, DFT simulations and experimental STM images in terms
of line profiles through images,8,10,15 our results suggest that another way to differentiate between various
adsorbates (or between adsorbates and vacancies) could be scanning
at higher bias voltages where one can take advantage of characteristic
bias-dependent signatures. At present, the products of water dissociation
on TiO2(110) have been fully characterized and understood.
However, as this particular surface continues to be explored for the
production of hydrogen via photocatalytic water splitting, the results
reported here can stimulate new avenues to understand more complex
adsorbates (e.g., alcohols)18,39,40 acting as electron donors/hole traps and their bias-dependent STM
signatures.
