The need for better microplastic
removal from wastewater streams
is clear, to prevent potential harm the microplastic may cause to
the marine life. This paper aims to investigate the efficacy of electrocoagulation
(EC), a well-known and established process, in the unexplored context
of microplastic removal from wastewater streams. This premise was
investigated using artificial wastewater containing polyethylene microbeads
of different concentrations. The wastewater was then tested in a 1
L stirred-tank batch reactor. The effects of the wastewater characteristics
(initial pH, NaCl concentration, and current density) on removal efficiency
were studied. Microbead removal efficiencies in excess of 90% were
observed in all experiments, thus suggesting that EC is an effective
method of removing microplastic contaminants from wastewater streams.
Electrocoagulation was found to be effective with removal efficiencies
in excess of 90%, over pH values ranging from 3 to 10. The optimum
removal efficiency of 99.24% was found at a pH of 7.5. An economic
evaluation of the reactor operating costs revealed that the optimum
NaCl concentration in the reactor is between 0 and 2 g/L, mainly due
to the reduced energy requirements linked to higher water conductivity.
In regard to the current density, the specific mass removal rate (kg/kWh)
was the highest for the lowest tested current density of 11 A/m2, indicating that low current density is more energy efficient
for microbead removal.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Over the last century,
the plastics industry has emerged and grown
into a monolith that affects us at every step of our lives. Over the
past 50 years, the use of plastics has increased 20-fold worldwide,
with a predicted doubling of plastic usage over the next 20 years.1 Sadly, this growth in plastic usage has also
manifested itself via an ever increasing presence of plastics in waste
streams, both on land and in water. It has been estimated that there
were over 150 million tons of plastic waste in marine waters as of
2016.2 Approximately, 0.1–1.5% of
this waste is made up of microplastics, which are defined as plastic
particles of less than 5 mm diameter.3 Microplastics
can be classified as either primary or secondary. Primary microplastics
are intentionally produced to fill very specific roles in many industries.
The largest use is in personal care and cosmetic products (PCCPs),
such as facial scrubs, where around 93% of all microplastics used
in PCCPs are polyethylene-derived beads.3 These microplastic particles commonly find their way into wastewater
streams, pass through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) untreated,
and finally end up in marine waters.4 Secondary
microplastics are produced when larger plastic particles that currently
find themselves in water streams break apart due to a combination
of UV degradation, mechanical stresses, and biological processes.5

Because of their small size, microplastics
that are present in
marine waters are easily ingested by the local marine flora. The impact
of the addition of plastic to the diet of marine organisms is not
fully understood. However, evidence has shown that cosmetic-derived
microbeads can transfer adsorbed organic pollutants to aquatic species
that ingest them, making cosmetic microbeads a serious but entirely
preventable source of marine pollution.6,7

A legislative
ban of microbeads in cosmetic products in developed
countries, such as the United States, has proven effective.8 However, in developing countries, PCCP regulation
is severely deficient9 and they lack both
the infrastructure and the capital to construct centralized WWTPs,
including expensive tertiary treatment capable of removing microbeads
from effluent streams.10 There is a clear
need for an innovative, cheap, and energy-efficient solution that
can be used both locally and to supplant existing tertiary treatment.

Electrochemical techniques, such as electrocoagulation (EC), electrodecantation,
and electroflotation, offer a cheaper method of tertiary treatment
that does not rely on chemicals or microorganisms, such as in chemical
coagulation or activated sludge processes. Instead, EC uses metal
electrodes to produce coagulant electrically, making the process simple
and robust.11 The benefits of electrochemical
processes, including EC, extend to environmental compatibility, low
capital costs, energy efficiency, sludge minimization, amenability
to automation, and cost effectiveness.12

The process of EC functions by liberating metal ions from
sacrificial
electrodes into the water stream via electrolysis. The anodic and
cathodic reactions are given in eqs 1–2 and 3–4, respectively. These ions
then form coagulants in situ. The most commonly used coagulants produced
by EC are formed by reaction of the metal ions, usually Fe2+ or Al3+, with OH– ions formed by electrolysis
to produce metal hydroxide coagulants. These coagulants destabilize
the surface charges of the suspended solids, breaking up the colloid
or emulsion, which in turn allows them to approach each other close
enough for van der Waals forces to take effect. Meanwhile, the coagulant
forms a sludge blanket, which traps the suspended solid particles.
The H2 gas liberated in the electrolysis process then lifts
the resultant sludge to the water surface.13 Presently, EC has been shown to effectively remove dyes,14 heavy metals,15 and
clay particles,16 with >80% of the polluting
particles removed after treatment. Effective removal of some liquid
organics has also been proven.11 However,
the possibility of using EC for the removal of microplastics, such
as polyethylene microbeads, has not been explored. In this context,
we propose to utilize a reactor setup that has not been explored by
other research groups, in the bid to reduce the operating cost of
the microbead removal process. This is the niche that this project
attempts to explore. To the author’s knowledge, our paper reports,
for the first time, the investigation of using EC for microbeads removal. 1   2   3   4   5  The aim of the
presented work is to investigate
the feasibility of using aluminum-based EC to effectively remove plastic
microbeads present in both domestic wastewater and industrial effluent.
The study focused on investigating three operational parameters: initial
pH, conductivity (NaCl concentration), and current density, to observe
their effects on the microbead removal efficiency and to optimize
both the microbead removal and energy efficiency. Removal and energy
efficiency were measured in terms of removal efficiency and specific
mass removal of the microbeads, respectively. On the basis of the
findings within this paper, possible operation parameters for the
implementation of EC as part of wastewater treatment were proposed.

2 Results and Discussion
For all of the investigations
in this study, substantial removal
of microbeads was observed with the EC process, with the highest removal
efficiency being 90–100%. Statistical analysis using the t
test adapted for non-normal distributions, the Mann–Whitney U test, shows that the microbead concentration in a treated
sample at any given time is always significantly lesser than the microbead
concentration in an untreated control sample (Mann–Whitney U test; U = 190.5, p <
0.0005). The U value shows the average difference
in applied statistical rank between treated and control samples, whereas p < 0.05 shows that these results are significant with
a >95% confidence level.

2.1 Effect of Initial pH
The initial
pH value of the water was found to be an important operational parameter
by other research groups17−19 for turbidity removal in industrial
estate and food processing wastewater and drinking water feeds using
the EC process. In these studies, there was often a characteristic
optimum pH range discovered for different wastewater types. Figure 1 shows the change
in the removal efficiency over time at different pH values. For all
of the pH values investigated (pH = 3, 5, 7.5, and 10), the removal
efficiency increases with time and reaches plateau after 40 min of
EC operation. The maximum removal efficiency achieved is found to
be 85–100%, showing that the EC process is effective for microbead
removal over a wide range of pH values (pH = 3–10). As seen
in Figure 1, there
is no significant variance in removal efficiency across the tested
pH range.

Figure 1 Microbead removal efficiency with time at different starting pH
values. All other reactor conditions: current density, 15 mA/cm2; sodium chloride as supporting electrolyte 10 g/L; initial
microbead (300–355 μm) concentration, 0.1 g/L; electrode
spacing, 1 cm; and stirring speed, 60 rpm.

Nevertheless, after 60 min of treatment, samples at all pH
ranges
expressed successful removal with final removal efficiencies of >85%.
From this data,
the characteristic optimum pH range for this wastewater analogue is
found to be pH = 3–10, indicating that EC is suitable for removing
microbeads from wastewater streams with a wide range of pH values.
The pH value of the wastewater depends on its origin. For example,
the domestic/municipal wastewater usually has a pH range of 6–9.2.20,21 This flexibility of the EC process with regards to pH means that
it could be used effectively for all common wastewater effluent-containing
microbeads without requiring the addition of further chemicals to
adjust the pH.

Figure 2 shows the
final microbead removal efficiency at different initial pH values
after 60 min of EC operation time. A removal efficiency of above 89%
is successfully achieved for all of the samples at pH values ranging
from 3 to 10. The final removal efficiencies at pH = 3 and 10 is lower
than those at pH = 5 and 7.5. The optimum final removal efficiency
of 99% was found at pH = 7.5. The results indicate that a more neutral
pH is expected to give better removal due to the favorable production
of coagulant at neutral pH, the same phenomena being reported by other
research groups.18

Figure 2 Final microbead removal
efficiency after 60 min of electrocoagulation
at different initial pH values. Reactor conditions same as those given
in Figure 1.

At pH = 3, it was also observed
that the beginning of floc formation
was only visible after 5 min, whereas floc formation was visible almost
immediately (<1 min) at all other initial pH values investigated.
Previous work has found that for an Al/H2O system at 25
°C, Al(OH)3 will be the predominant species above
pH = 3.7.13 Below pH = 3.7, the reaction
described by eq 5 is
less favorable and Al3+ is dominant. Figure 3 shows the change in pH of the wastewater
samples with a constant line at pH = 3.7. The sample with initial
pH = 3.0 took approximately 5 min to cross pH = 3.7, which agrees
with the above observation that flocs began visibly forming after
5 min. This was when the pH was high enough for Al3+ to
react favorably to form Al(OH)3 precipitate.

Figure 3 pH change against
electrolysis time at different starting pH values
(light blue filled circles, pH = 3.0; green filled squares, pH = 5.0;
dark blue filled triangles, pH = 7.5; and black filled inverted triangles,
pH = 10.0). Reactor conditions are the same as in Figure 2. The red line shows constant
pH = 3.7 above which Al(OH)3 is the dominant metal species.

Although floc formation is clearly
affected by pH, the time-dependent
removal efficiency in Figure 1 shows small dependence on pH values. Visible observations
showed that complete coverage of the reactor in a floc blanket with
microbeads being seen visibly adsorbed on the flocs occurred at 15
min. This indicates that floc production may not be a significant
factor when determining removal in the first 15 min. It is speculated
that the mechanism of charge neutralization by Al3+ ions
may be as effective as the flocculation mechanism by Al(OH)3 within this time frame. Further research is required to understand
in detail the dominating mechanism for microbead removal at different
pH values.

2.2 Effect of Conductivity
The effect
of conductivity of the wastewater was investigated by adjusting the
concentration of NaCl in the sample. The minimum and maximum salt
concentrations employed were 2 and 8 g/L, respectively, corresponding
to measured wastewater conductivities of 7.44 and 13.75 mS/cm. Figure 4 shows the average
time-dependent removal efficiency at each NaCl concentration. Over
the range of 2–8 g/L, NaCl concentration had no significant
effect on removal efficiency at any time. The microbead removal efficiency
increases with time and reaches a plateau after 40 min. All samples
treated show >90% final removal efficiency after EC treatment for
60 min.

Figure 4 Microbead removal efficiency against time at different NaCl concentrations.
All other reactor conditions: current density, 15 mA/cm2; initial pH = 7.5; initial microbead (300–355 μm) concentration
0.1 g/L; electrode spacing, 1 cm; and stirring speed, 60 rpm.

The results show that the increased
presence of Cl– ions has minor effect on the removal
efficiency (especially for
NaCl concentration below 8 g/L), whereas previous studies22 showed heavy dependence of the removal efficiency
of the targeted pollutants (dyes) on the concentration of Cl– ions. In the previous study, it was found that the presence of Cl– ions and formed HOCl resulted in side reactions that
decomposed the dyes and aided adsorption onto the formed flocs,22 whereas in the case of microbead removal, at
the pH range that was investigated, there was no evidence to suggest
that the removal of polyethylene microbeads was affected by the presence
of Cl– and HOCl species. It is postulated that the
time taken for HOCl to cause degradation in the microbeads is far
longer than the 60 min residence time of the electrochemical reactor
and so the effect of NaCl concentration on the removal efficiency
is not significant.

The energy consumption, E(t),
of the EC cell was calculated. Throughout the EC process, the voltage
fluctuated with time to keep a constant density as set by the direct
current (DC) power supply. As such, further calculations will be using
the time-averaged voltage applied, V, and the constant
current, I. From E(t) and the absolute removal, Mabs,t (eq 13, found
in Section 4.3),
the specific mass removal per unit energy (g/kJ), Xs(t), of the cell was calculated, using eqs 6 and 7. 6   7  Figure 5 shows the
calculated energy-specific removal over time for
each NaCl concentration studied. It can be seen that specific removal
is improved as NaCl concentration is increased. The sample containing
8 g/L of NaCl consumed 62% less electrical energy than that of the
sample containing 2 g/L of NaCl. This revealed the possibility of
optimizing the energy consumption (which is directly related to the
operation cost) based on the addition of NaCl. According to Ozyonar
and Karagozoglu,23 the operating cost per
cubic meter of water treated by an EC reactor can be described using eq 8 (adapted to include the
cost of NaCl). Note that this is simplified and does not consider
the costs of waste sludge removal, cleaning, and maintenance that
a full-scale reactor would incur 8  The salinity of wastewater has been found
to have no significant effect on electrodissolution rate.13 This optimization is simplified to only consider
the effect of NaCl concentration on operating cost, therefore revealing
the optimum NaCl concentration for any other combination of operating
conditions. Because electrode consumption and its associated costs
do not depend on NaCl concentration, eq 8 can be simplified to 9  where energycons and saltcons are the consumptions of electricity and
NaCl per m3 of
water treated, respectively. X and Y are the unit costs of electricity (p/kWh) and NaCl (p/kg), respectively.

Figure 5 Specific
microbead removal (g/kJ) against time at different NaCl
concentrations. The reactor conditions are the same as Figure 6.

Figure 6 shows the estimated operating costs as a
function
of salt concentration for an EC cell operating for 60 min, at a current
density of 15 mA/cm2, an electrode spacing of 1.5 cm, and
stirring speed of 60 rpm. As the NaCl concentration in wastewater
increases, operating cost increases. This is a result of the increase
in the amount (therefore, cost) of NaCl salt added to achieve the
corresponding NaCl concentration. Figure 6 shows that for NaCl concentration higher
than 3 g/L, the largest factor affecting cost is the salt consumption
per m3 of water treated.

Figure 6 EC reactor operating costs per m3 of water treated against
different NaCl concentrations. Operating cost calculations done using eqs 9–12. Unit cost of electricity based on cost of electricity (9.83
p/kWh) for industrial consumers.24 Unit
cost of NaCl = 0.798 p/kg.

Figure 6 also
shows
that the cost of electricity is the dominant factor in determining
the operation cost, when the NaCl added is below 3 g/L. Of all of
the concentration values tested, the minimum operating cost (for factors
related to salt concentration) for microbead removal was found to
be at 2 kg/m3 NaCl.

2.3 Effect
of Current Density
Current
density is a key parameter in the application of EC as it is an operating
parameter that can be directly controlled using the DC power supply.13,25Figure 7 shows the
average microbead removal rates for the different tested current densities.
Between 11 and 23 A/m2, there was no distinct difference
in removal rates between the current density values tested at any
specific time.

Figure 7 Average fractional removal for varied current densities.

According to Faraday’s
law of electrolysis (eq 10), it is expected that increasing
current density of the cell will result in an increase in metal ions
liberated from the electrodes. This means that high amount of metal
ions and therefore flocculants is expected to be present at high current
density. 10  Figure 7 shows that removal efficiency of microbeads
by EC is not
significantly affected by the change in current density. This indicates
that the amount of metal ions does not cause obvious removal of microbeads
for the range of current densities investigated. It is clear that
flocculation and settling appear to be the dominant mechanism of microbead
removal when an excess of coagulant has been produced. The time at
which coagulants are in excess and flocculation mechanisms dominate
appears to be between 0 and 30 min as current density appears to have
a more important effect on microbead removal over this time frame.
This is shown by the decrease in gradient of the removal efficiency
lines after 30 min in Figure 7. This implies that operating the reactor for more than 30
min would create excess coagulant with little effect on removal efficiency
compared to allowing it to settle after 30 min. Meanwhile, longer
operation will result in more reactor waste and greater electrode
and energy consumption.

The most energy-efficient current density
for microbead removal
in this particular EC cell was found by comparing the specific mass
removed per kJ of energy spent against current density. Figure 8 shows that at higher current
densities the specific removal of the microbeads is reduced, largely
due to the increase in energy consumption at higher current densities
but yielding no significant increase in removal efficiency.

Figure 8 Specific microbead
mass removal for different current densities.

From Figure 8, the
lowest current density tested, 11 A/m2, offers the highest
energy-efficient microbeads removal over the 1 h operational time.
It is speculated that the most efficient current density may be lower
than the range currently tested. On the basis of these results, we
can conclude that current density does not affect the removal efficiency
of the EC cell but operating at a lower current density will improve
the energy efficiency of the cell. However, changing current density
will also determine at what time the reactor will start producing
an excess of coagulant, which will not further improve removal efficiency
and will incur excess of reactor waste and increased electrode consumption.
The time at which the reactor begins producing in excess will be specific
to the reactor conditions, specifically current density, and can be
used to determine the best operating time for the reactor in question.

2.4 Comparison with Previous Literature
Table 1 summarizes
the results from recent studies involving electrocoagulation of various
pollutants. It is noted that there is no other study in the literature
using EC for the removal of microbeads. Therefore, direct comparison
of our results with the literature is not possible. As shown in Table 1, the pollutant removal
rate (typically above 90%) and optimum pH (∼7) from other work
agree very well with our work. The apparatus we designed in this work
has, however, managed to achieve a considerable reduction in operating
cost compared to that by most other research groups. This is mainly
attributed to the type of pollutants and the fact that microbeads
undergo rapid charge neutralization during the first 15 min, which
is able to quickly remove the 50–80% of the initial load of
microbeads within this time frame. In the remaining operating period,
flocculation mechanisms dominate and act to polish the wastewater
and remove the remaining microbeads trapped in colloidal suspension.
The combined mechanisms allow for substantial removal compared with
previous research while also requiring less power to operate. It is
recommended that, by exploiting the combination of these effects,
low-cost treatment of microbead-laden streams is feasible. Further
work would involve optimization of the operation time so that power
and electrode consumption could be further minimized.

3 Conclusions
In this study, the removal of spherical
microbeads from simulated
wastewater by electrocoagulation using aluminum electrodes was investigated.
The effects of pH, conductivity, and current density were studied
in an electrochemical batch reactor in bipolar, parallel configuration.
The results showed that EC is an effective method of removing microbeads
from simulated domestic wastewater. Observations showed that microbeads
underwent both flocculation and charge neutralization simultaneously.
By configuring the reactor to exploit both mechanisms, the reactor
operating costs are reduced. For the range of parameters investigated,
the optimum reactor conditions were found to be pH = 7.5, NaCl concentration
= 2 g/L, and current density = 11 A/m2. Future investigations
are recommended to examine the effects of further reducing NaCl concentration
and current density on the EC operation efficiency and cost. The most
viable option for a large-scale industrial EC cell for removing microbeads
seems to be a two-stage, continuous EC reactor/settler unit. Further
research should look at possible reactor designs and configurations
to optimize the process.

4 Materials and Methods
Electrocoagulation was conducted in a bench-scale stirred-tank
batch reactor (details are given in Section 4.1). Wastewater analogue (1 L, details are
given in Section 4.2) was added and electrodes placed in parallel along the reactor. Figure 9 shows the schematic
of the reactor setup, connected to a DC power supply, which controls
the voltage and current density of the EC operation. The reactor was
run for 60 min for each experiment and then turned off, after which
the contents were allowed to settle for 16 h.

reactor setup used in the investigation.

Three investigations were conducted separately, each with
different
independent variables. The values of the controlled variables along
with the range of variables studied for each investigation are given
in Table 2.

4.1 Electrochemical Reactor
A 1 L rectangular
tank (233 mm × 130 mm × 100 mm) was used as the reactor
containing wastewater analogue. Seven metal electrodes each of 90
mm × 30 mm × 1 mm were cut from the same 1 mm thick aluminum
sheet. The electrodes were placed in the reactor vessels in parallel
configuration suspended by a nonconductive plastic rod of 10 mm diameter.
The two outermost electrodes were fixed to copper wires by pop-rivet
connectors leading to a Farnell Ltd. triple output (4–6, 5–17
V) DC power supply. Only the outermost electrodes, one acting as the
primary anode and the other as the primary cathode, were connected
directly to the power supply giving a parallel, bipolar configuration.
The five unconnected electrodes in between the anode and the cathode
would then act as bipolar sacrificial electrodes. This resulted in
a parallel, bipolar electrode setup. Bipolar configuration was chosen
because it appeared to offer better removal rates in other EC investigations.32 The use of unconnected sacrificial electrodes
was preferable as it reduced the number of interelectrode connections
making the reactor easier to set up and clean in between experiments,
while still providing a source of aluminum ions (albeit not as strong
a source as a connected electrode). The connections between the powered
electrodes were reversed after each experiment to prevent excessive,
preferential, oxide (passive) layers forming on one electrode. The
mixing within the reactor was achieved by a Fisher Scientific magnetic
stirrer set at 60 rpm (placed at the bottom of the reactor) to evenly
disperse the formed flocs.

This EC reactor as described above
is also suitable for the removal of other substances from wastewater.
In some unpublished work, we have used this system to improve the
quality of the opaque water from a local lake. The EC process using
this system successfully removed the organic matters and particles
contained in the water, turning the lake water from opaque to transparent.

4.2 Wastewater Analogue
To gain a better
understanding of the effects of water properties, a wastewater analogue
was produced to emulate the conditions of domestic wastewater while
allowing for complete control over the variables. In this study, four
variables affecting the wastewater properties are investigated, including
pH, conductivity of water, and the concentration and particle size
of microbeads.

The wastewater analogue was made up using industrial
fresh water with an average conductivity of 447 μS/cm and a
pH of 7.5. HCl (1 M) and NaOH (1 M) solutions were used to control
the pH without allowing a buffer to form in the initial sample. NaCl
crystals (99.5% w/w, Fisher Chemicals) were added to 1 L of the water
to adjust conductivity as required.

Fluorescent green, spherical
microbeads of 300–355 μm
(0.997 g/cm3) were used. According to the supplier (Cospheric
LLC), >90% of the microbeads, which are used in industry and end
up
in wastewater streams, were expected to have similar size ranges;
also >90% of the microbeads are spherical. The concentration of
microbeads
was controlled to be 0.1 g/L for this investigation.

The polyethylene
beads were hydrophobic at the time of manufacture.
To ensure that the microbeads are fully dispersed in water, 2 g of
cussons morning fresh washing up liquid, acting as a source of surfactants,
was added to every 1 L of wastewater sample. The contained surfactants
emulate an average domestic wastewater surfactant concentration of
300 mg/L33 and aid the microbeads to evenly
form a suspension as they would in real wastewater. Figure 10 shows the image of the as-made
wastewater analogue with microbeads well dispersed.

wastewater analogue before the EC
process.

4.3 Variable
Measurements
The EC reactor
was run for 60 min with water property measurements taken at every
5 min interval from 0 to 20 min, then followed by further sampling
at 30, 45, and 60 min. Temperature and conductivity were continually
monitored using a Mettler Toledo Five Easy Plus conductivity meter
(calibrated using 0.1 g/L of KCl calibrating solution). pH was measured
at each interval using ±0.5 accuracy pH indicator sticks (Fisher
Scientific). Current and voltage readings were taken from the power
supply readout at each sample time.

As EC progressed, the wastewater
analogue became visibly more turbid due to the formation of a polymeric
floc structure thought to be Al(OH)3. Mixing at 60 rpm
dispersed these flocs relatively easily throughout the vessel, and
some microbeads were visibly seen attached to the flocs. After 16
h settlement followed the EC process, the contents of the reactor
settled. The formed floc blanket sank to the bottom of the reactor
and took with it most of the contained microbeads. The remaining liquid
bulk was visibly more clear and free of microbeads compared to that
of the original samples.

The removal of microbeads was tracked
by taking samples from the
reactor during the EC operation. A representative 20 mL of sample
was extracted from the bulk of the liquid by a 20 mL plastic syringe.
The samples then underwent gravity filtration through Grade 1 Whatman
filter papers and then were dried at 20 °C for 16 h. The number
of microbeads, Nt, for each dried sample
was counted. The estimated bulk concentration for the particle diameter, dp, at the sample time was then calculated by 11  For 300–355 μm microbeads employed
in this investigation, an average dp =
327.5 μm was used in calculation, where ρ is the density
of the polyethylene microbeads and Cmb is the microbead concentration in the bulk of the liquid (g/L).
Absolute mass removal, Mabs,t, at sample time, t, was calculated by 12  And the removal
efficiency, Mr,t, is
calculated by 13  

4.4 Reactor Maintenance
The reactor vessel
was rinsed after each experiment with distilled water, and the electrodes
were cleaned by acid bath in 1 M hydrochloric acid for 30 min. After
being rinsed clean with deionized water, the edges were deburred using
a file. This was done to remove much of the oxide layer formed during
experiments, which would prevent electrode passivation from affecting
the removal efficiency.
