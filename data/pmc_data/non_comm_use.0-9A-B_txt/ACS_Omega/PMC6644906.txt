Conversion
reaction materials (transition metal oxides, sulfides,
phosphides, etc.) are attractive in the field of lithium-ion batteries
because of their high theoretical capacity and low cost. However,
the realization of these materials in lithium-ion batteries is impeded
by large voltage hysteresis, high polarization, inferior cycle stability,
rate capability, irreversible capacity loss in first cycling, and
dramatic volume change during redox reactions. One method to overcome
these problems is the introduction of amorphous materials. This work
introduces a facile method to synthesize amorphous and crystalline
dinickel phosphide (Ni2P) nanoparticle clusters with identical
morphology and presents a direct comparison of the two materials as
anode materials for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. To assess
the effect of crystallinity and hierarchical structure of nanomaterials,
it is crucial to conserve other factors including size, morphology,
and ligand of nanoparticles. Although it is rarely studied about synthetic
methods of well-controlled Ni2P nanomaterials to meet the
above criteria, we synthesized amorphous, crystalline Ni2P, and self-assembled Ni2P nanoparticle clusters via thermal
decomposition of nickel–surfactant complex. Interestingly,
simple modulation of the quantity of nickel acetylacetonate produced
amorphous, crystalline, and self-assembled Ni2P nanoparticles.
A 0.357 M nickel–trioctylphosphine (TOP) solution leads to
a reaction temperature limitation (∼315 °C) by the nickel
precursor, and crystalline Ni2P (c-Ni2P) nanoparticles
clusters are generated. On the contrary, a lower concentration (0.1
M) does not accompany a temperature limitation and hence high reaction
temperature (330 °C) can be exploited for the self-assembly of
Ni2P (s-Ni2P) nanoparticle clusters. Amorphous
Ni2P (a-Ni2P) nanoparticle clusters are generated
with a high concentration (0.714 M) of nickel–TOP solution
and a temperature limitation (∼290 °C). The a-Ni2P nanoparticle cluster electrode exhibits higher capacities and Coulombic
efficiency than the electrode based on c-Ni2P nanoparticle
clusters. In addition, the amorphous structure of Ni2P
can reduce irreversible capacity and voltage hysteresis upon cycling.
The amorphous morphology of Ni2P also improves the rate
capability, resulting in superior performance to those of c-Ni2P nanoparticle clusters in terms of electrode performance.

1 Introduction
With
global warming and fluctuating oil prices, research on new
energy sources that are based on eco-friendly and abundant resources
such as solar radiation, wind, and waves has become an important topic
worldwide.1−5 With these new energy sources, the importance of energy-storage
devices is also gradually being recognized. In particular, lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) are promising power sources for not only cell phones
and laptops but also electric vehicles and energy storage systems.4−7 Many commercial LIBs consist of a LiCoO2 cathode, a carbon
anode, and a separator with an electrolyte.8 To improve the current LIB performance, it is necessary to use new
negative electrode materials which have high capacity, low cost, and
environmental benignity.6,9,10 Recently, a new reactivity concept based on the reversible electrochemical
reaction of lithium is attracting attention in the field of LIBs.11,12 In the conversion reaction, the active electrode is consumed by
Li ions and converted to an embedded nanometer-scale metal in a lithium-anion
matrix.11−13 Conversion reaction materials have notable advantages,
including high theoretical capacity because of transfer of more than
one electron per 3D metal in a redox cycle. Good electronic conductivity
from the Li–X matrix (X = O, F, N, S, and P) and short diffusion
distance from the metal nanocomposite are also benefits.7,11,12 However, conversion reaction
materials have many drawbacks in terms of their use as negative electrode
of LIBs. In particular, large polarization, irreversible capacity
loss on first cycling, low Coulombic efficiency, extreme voltage hysteresis,
volume expansion during the redox cycle, and poor kinetics have not
yet been resolved.11−13

Successful strategies to overcome these problems
include reducing
the particle size of materials to the nanometer scale to accommodate
large volume change8,13−18 and using amorphous electrodes to replace crystalline materials
to achieve faster conversion reaction rates.19−24 Maier et al. reported enhanced potential of an amorphous RuO2 electrode.20 Zachariah et al.
reported that interspersed amorphous MnOx–carbon nanocomposites have superior electrochemical performance,19 and Stevenson et al. demonstrated a great method
to produce amorphous FeP2 in high yield and remarkable
performance.21

However, to the best
of our knowledge, there is no report about
pure difference between amorphous and crystalline electrodes except
for other factors such as size differential, existence of conducting
agent, different morphology, and so on. Our group has the curiosity
for a pure amorphous effect on conversion reaction system under identical
conditions.

Therefore, we are trying to introduce a facile method
for synthesizing
amorphous and crystalline dinickel phosphide nanoparticle clusters.
Furthermore, the electrochemical difference of conversion reaction
between crystalline and amorphous materials with Li+ by
using nickel phosphides was analyzed. Synthetic methods for nanoscale
Ni2P in different forms such as wires, solid particles,
hollow particles, and rods were reported.25−28 Research studies about sandwichlike-coupled
Ni2P nanoparticles and graphene were also studied.29,30 In particular, amorphous nickel phosphide was introduced by Tracy
group that amorphous-solid nickel phosphide forms at 240 °C under
phosphine-rich condition.31 In addition,
Tu group made a core/shell-structured amorphous@crystalline nickel
phosphide nanoparticles by ionothermal method.22

Herein, a facile method to synthesize Ni2P nanostructures
with controlled crystallinity and identical morphology by adjusting
the quantity of nickel acetylacetonate is introduced. Furthermore,
amorphous Ni2P (a-Ni2P) nanoparticle clusters
were electrochemically compared with crystalline Ni2P (c-Ni2P) to unveil the amorphous effect on the conversion reaction
with Li+.

2 Results and Discussion
Amorphous and crystalline Ni2P nanoparticle clusters
with identical morphology were synthesized by the thermal decomposition
of metal surfactant complex, depending on the nickel precursor concentration.
To obtain the nanostructured Ni2P materials, we adopted
the thermal decomposition method of metal–surfactant complex,
which is superior to other synthetic routes in terms of control of
size, morphology, and phase.25 Using this
method, we successfully synthesized the Ni2P nanostructured
anode materials with controlled morphology and crystallinity of Ni2P nanomaterials by facile control of molar concentration of
injected precursors. Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns for the resulting a-Ni2P, c-Ni2P, and self-assembled Ni2P (s-Ni2P) nanoparticle clusters, respectively. Figure 1a has only a broad peak at about 45°,
indicating that an amorphous material was synthesized. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were performed to
verify that the sample (a) is Ni2P. The X-ray diffractometer
(XRD) patterns of c-Ni2P nanoparticle clusters (Figure 1b) and s-Ni2P nanoparticle clusters (Figure 1c) were perfectly matched with hexagonal nickel phosphide
(JCPDS 74-1385). Broadening in the peaks of both particles implies
the formation of nanometer scale particles. Furthermore, the diffraction
peaks of s-Ni2P nanoparticle clusters were stronger and
sharper than those of c-Ni2P nanoparticle clusters, indicating
higher crystallinity.

Figure 1 High-power XRD data of (a) amorphous Ni2P nanoparticle
clusters, (b) crystalline Ni2P nanoparticle clusters, and
(c) self-assembled Ni2P nanoparticle clusters.

Figure 2a,c shows
TEM images of crystalline and amorphous Ni2P nanoparticles
clusters. Figure 2b,d
clearly demonstrates that two types of nanoparticles have similar
spherical morphology and size. The corresponding electron diffraction
patterns of a-Ni2P were smeared in one circle elucidating
that the nanoparticles were amorphous (Figure S1). High-resolution TEM image of the c-Ni2P showed
the lattice fringe with the lattice spacing of 0.22 nm, which is corresponding
to the (111) planes of hexagonal Ni2P structure indicating
the crystalline property (Figure S2). Each
particle is on average 5 nm in diameter, and these small particles
join together to form clusters. In addition, EDS measurements confirm
that amorphous nanoparticle clusters are dinickel phosphides (Figure 2e). The ratio of
components between nickel and phosphorus is almost 2:1. Cu and C come
from the carbon-coated Cu substrate. Figure 3 illustrates the synthetic procedure. a-Ni2P and c-Ni2P electrodes that have identical morphology
and size were prepared by injecting an Ni–trioctylphosphine
(TOP) solution into TOP oxide (TOPO) as a bottom solution at 330 °C.
The high temperature of the bottom solution leads to instantaneous
formation of nuclei, followed by slow growth.33 As a result, Ni2P nanoparticles are formed. The synthetic
mechanism of nickel phosphides is very well-known.25,26,34 Our group previously reported that TOP is
a good phosphorus source precursor to synthesize transition-metal
phosphides.26,35 Because C–P bonds in TOP
catalytically are cleaved when combined with some metals, P atoms
can diffuse into the metal,36 thereby generating
metal phosphides. a-Ni2P, c-Ni2P, and s-Ni2P nanoparticle clusters are generated by adjusting the quantity
of nickel acetylacetonate, which made it possible to limit the aging
temperature. All syntheses are conducted under a TOP-rich condition
in comparison with other experiments25,31,37 because a TOP-rich environment acts not only as a
P source but also as a surfactant.

EDS data of amorphous Ni2P nanoparticle clusters; and (f,g)

Figure 3 Schematic illustration of the formation of nickel phosphides.

When the volume of Ni–TOP
solution is based on 10 mL, 0.357
M Ni–TOP solution limits the reaction temperature (∼315
°C) by the high concentration of the nickel precursor, and c-Ni2P nanoparticle clusters are then generated. When the concentration
of Ni–TOP solution is higher than 0. 714 M, a-Ni2P nanoparticle clusters are formed because of the low reaction temperature
(∼290 °C) by the nickel precursor. Low aging temperature
(below 300 °C) leads to amorphous Ni2P nanoparticles31 and a large amount of undecomposed TOP causes
the nanoparticles to cluster.

Furthermore, a lower concentration
(0.1 M) does not impose a temperature
limitation, and hence high reaction temperature (330 °C) leads
to the formation of s-Ni2P nanoparticle clusters (Figure 2e). From the result
of low volume/high concentration experiments, the reaction temperature
has a dominant effect on shape control of crystalline Ni2P over the injection solution concentration. The quantity of nickel
precursor was fixed at 0.5 mmol, and the amount of TOP was reduced
to 5, 2, and 1 mL. As the amount was decreased, the self-assembled
spherical morphology collapsed (Figure S3).

2.1 Electrochemical Properties
Electrochemical
measurements were performed on a 2016 coin-type half-cell, where Li
metal foil was used as the counter electrode. Figure 4a shows the cycling performance of the Ni2P electrodes at 0.5 C, and Figure 4b describes the rate performance of the Ni2P electrodes. The first discharge capacities of a-Ni2P and c-Ni2P electrodes were 942.6 and 974.9 mA h g–1, and the reversible charge capacities were 573.2
and 526.8 mA h g–1, respectively. The higher capacities
over the theoretical capacity (542 mA h g–1) in
the first cycle are related to decomposition of the electrolyte upon
reduction with the formation of a polymeric film at low potentials
and interfacial storage of Li+.11−13 Additionally,
the a-Ni2P electrodes exhibited better cycle result compared
to c-Ni2P electrodes. This result means that the isotropic
environment and the absence of grain boundaries of amorphous structure
relieve the damage during the insertion of lithium ion.39 In the subsequent cycles, the a-Ni2P electrode showed better Coulombic efficiency (99.1%) and capacity
retention than the c-Ni2P electrode (96.8%). Furthermore,
reversible capacities of the two forms of Ni2P after 50
cycles were 351.5 and 262.9 mA h g–1. In Figure 4b, the rate performance
of a-Ni2P nanoparticles is higher than c-Ni2P, and it means that diffusion of lithium ion in a-Ni2P nanoparticles is superior to c-Ni2P.40 According to previous studies, it has been suggested that
percolation pathways from interfacial region in disordered structure
increase the Li diffusivity.41 The reason
for enhancement is an increase of pre-exponential factors and/or a
decrease of the activation energy of the Arrhenius equation.42 One of the products, s-Ni2P nanoclusters,
was also studied because it is well-established that self-assembled
structures have the potential to reduce the transport pathways of
Li+ ions and electrons.50 To
confirm the effect of secondary hierarchical Ni2P structures,
we evaluated its cycle performance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurement (Figure S4). However,
its specific capacity (174 mA h g–1 after 30 cycles)
was significantly lower than the theoretical capacity (542 mA h g–1); we thought that significant side reactions would
be dominant in this case compared to a-Ni2P and c-Ni2P nanoparticles. The cell performance of a-Ni2P
nanoparticles (351.5 mA h g–1) can be matched with
other type of Ni2P electrodes. Porous Ni2P nanosheets,
single crystalline Ni2P nanowires, and hierarchical Ni2P spheres presented the reversible capacities of 379.8, 326,
and 365.3 mA h g–1 respectively at 0.5 C after 50
cycles.16,46,48 Comparing
to the amorphous anode electrode, the performance of c-Ni2P (262.9 mA h g–1) was significantly lower than
other structured Ni2P electrodes.

Figure 4 (a) Cyclic performance
of Ni2P nanoparticles cluster
electrodes at 0.5 C. (b) Rate performance of a-Ni2P and
c-Ni2P nanoparticle cluster electrodes.

The gap in the initial reversible capacity was
continuously maintained
throughout the cycling. In other words, the initial Coulombic efficiency
(ICE) is very important in conversion reaction electrodes. The gap
in the ICE between the two nickel phosphide electrodes proves that
a-Ni2P is superior to c-Ni2P at the first cycle.
The a-Ni2P nanoparticle cluster electrode has a higher
ICE (average 63.61%) than the c-Ni2P nanoparticle cluster
electrode (average 58.20%) at 0.1 C, and the same results were obtained
at 0.5 C (Figure S5). The irreversible
capacity loss upon the first cycle is from the formation of a solid
electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and irreversible conversion reaction.11,12 To shed light on this irreversible capacity gap of both electrodes
upon first cycling, we analyze both electrodes by the galvanostatic
intermittent titration technique (GITT). The GITT is one of the most
powerful techniques for observing key thermodynamics and kinetic data
about battery performance.49Figure 5a shows the GITT curves of
the two electrodes. The relaxation time is 4 h. It is well-known that
upon first cycling, nickel phosphides convert to Li3P and
Ni with an intermediate step of an insertion reaction.14,16 In the initial normalized capacity region, the plateau indicates
that Ni2P forms intermediate Lix–Ni2P by an insertion reaction because of the covalence
of nickel phosphides. Another plateau represents the conversion process
where Lix–Ni2P and lithium
convert to a Li3P matrix and nickel metal.14 The advantage of a-Ni2P in electrical networking
was confirmed by EIS measurements (Figure 5b). By comparing the result of c-Ni2P electrodes, the spectra for a-Ni2P electrodes exhibit
much smaller high-frequency semicircle which is interpreted by enhanced
electronic conductivity and charge-transfer kinetics of the a-Ni2P networking. The polarization between closed-circuit voltage
and quasi-open-circuit voltage (QOCV) after 4 h relaxation at the
first cycling is indicated in Figure S6. In the initial discharge region, polarization of a-Ni2P was higher than that of c-Ni2P. However, the polarization
reversed during the discharge process. The polarization can represent
the resistance by the equation V = IR because the current is constant. Therefore, the results indicate
that the resistances of both electrodes were reversed in the middle
of the reaction. This reversal of resistance is due to the additional
resistance under amorphization of the c-Ni2P electrode.
Amorphous electrodes can react with lithium as solid solution behavior
without a phase transition.43 Therefore,
the a-Ni2P electrode has reduced resistance because the
loss of electrical contact between particles during the conversion
reaction by large volume changes and structural stresses are reduced.
After the region of insertion process, the polarization of both electrodes
sharply decreases in the first discharge process because Ni2P converts to a Ni/Li3P complex, which has good electronic
conductivity by the way of conversion process.44

Figure 5 (a) GITT curves of both electrodes in the first cycle and (b) Nyquist
plots for electrodes of a-Ni2P nanoparticles and c-Ni2P nanoparticles.

The large voltage hysteresis is one of the features of the
conversion
process.14 Comparing the electrodes, the
a-Ni2P electrode has lower voltage hysteresis than the
c-Ni2P electrode for the conversion reaction between the
first lithiation and delithiation process (Figure S7a). This is a critical factor to improve the ICE of the conversion
process.14 Furthermore, the gap of the
voltage hysteresis between the two electrodes is continuously maintained
throughout cycling. The voltage hysteresis curve between the first
charge and the second discharge profile (Figure S7b) and the gap of QOCV from the GITT curve also indicated
that a-Ni2P has lower voltage hysteresis than c-Ni2P. This is ascribed, at least in part, to amorphization of
crystalline Ni2P, which has enhanced Gibbs free energy.19,20 The above results suggest that a-Ni2P may achieve a faster
conversion reaction and lower volume expansion than the c-Ni2P electrode.19 This is a very interesting
result because large voltage hysteresis between charge and discharge
is a major to commercialize conversion materials because of the diminished
round-trip efficiency of the electrode.14

The volume expansion of electrodes during lithiation and delithiation
was measured through ex situ measurement of electrode thickness (Figure 6). All cells were
cycled for 0.1 C at 30 °C in a potential range of 0.02–3.0
V versus Li/Li+. After full lithiation until the redox
potential of the working electrode reached 0.02 V versus Li/Li+, the c-Ni2P and a-Ni2P electrodes led
to considerably smaller volume expansion than the theoretical volume
expansion because the nanostructure reduces the mechanical strain
induced by volume change.15,38,45 In addition, the a-Ni2P electrode showed considerable
volume expansion of about 120%, whereas the c-Ni2P electrode
displayed a thickness change of about 164% in the fully lithiated
state. As shown in SEM data (Figure S8),
we could detect more heterogeneous region on c-Ni2P electrodes
compared with a-Ni2P electrodes. A tendency to agglomerate
between s-Ni2P nanoclusters after cycling in SEM image
was observed because high crystallinity is unfavorable to relieve
the damage during insertion of lithium ion (Figure S9). As the cycle processed, the contact between c-Ni2P and binder was rapidly deteriorated, and this might interrupt the
migration of electrons in electrodes.

Figure 6 (a) Voltage profiles (solid line) of Ni2P nanoparticle
cluster electrodes and the corresponding electrode thickness change
(bar) during lithiation and delithiation. (b) Camera image of opened
electrodes after cycling: a-Ni2P nanoparticles and c-Ni2P nanoparticles during lithiation and delithiation.

Figure S10 shows the electrochemical
behavior of the a-Ni2P and c-Ni2P nanoparticle
cluster electrodes characterized by cyclic voltammograms at a scanning
rate of 0.2 mV s–1 between 0.02 and 3 V. The small
anodic peak of a-Ni2P at 1.80 V implies that Ni2P reacts with Li+ by an insertion process. The maximum
reduction peak of a-Ni2P is located at 0.66 V. The maximum
peak indicates that Lix–Ni2P decomposes to not only metallic Ni and a Li3P
matrix but also forms of the SEI layer.16,46 For c-Ni2P, these peaks shift to 1.93 and 0.94 V. Comparing the intensity
of redox peaks of both electrodes, the peaks of the a-Ni2P electrode are sharper than those of c-Ni2P. In particular,
the second oxidation peak of the a-Ni2P electrode, which
is evidently higher than the others, suggests that the amount of reversible
reaction is larger than that of the c-Ni2P electrode.16,47

3 Conclusions
Crystalline and amorphous
nickel diphosphide nanoparticle clusters
that have almost same shape and size were synthesized by a simple
hot-injection method. This was achieved by adjusting the quantity
of nickel acetylacetonate, which made it possible to limit the aging
temperature. Furthermore, its electrochemical characteristics were
investigated to analyze the effect of amorphous morphology on the
conversion reaction in a LIB. These materials were characterized by
TEM, SEM, XRD, and EDS. From the characterization, amorphous and crystalline
spherical ∼5 nm clusters have almost the same size and structure.
In addition, self-assembled Ni2P nanoparticle clusters
could be generated at 330 °C without oleylamine. The electrochemical
results showed that amorphous materials in isolation from other factors
can be used to overcome the problems impeding conversion reaction
materials, such as low ICE, large voltage hysteresis, capacity retention,
and serious volume expansion. a-Ni2P provides superior
ICE over the crystalline materials in the conversion reaction with
Li+ because there is no amorphization process. In addition,
amorphous nickel phosphide can reduce voltage hysteresis and volume
expansion during cycling, which are very serious obstacles to the
commercialization of conversion materials. In the future, it will
be of significant interest to synthesize amorphous nanometer scale
conversion materials such as iron oxides and manganese oxides.

anhydrous [Ni(acac)2] 95% was purchased from Strem Chemical
Inc. TOP, technical grade, 90% and TOPO, technical grade, 90% were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. Chloroform and ethanol were
purchased from SK Chemical. All chemicals were used without further
purification.

4.2 Synthesis of Nanosized
Ni2P Particles
The Ni2P materials were
synthesized by a hot-injection
method in an argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk-line techniques.
The s-Ni2P was prepared by the following procedure. A Ni–TOP
solution was prepared by reacting 1 mmol of Ni(acac)2 and
10 mL of TOP (0.1 M Ni–TOP) at 60 °C until the solution
became sky blue. A TOPO solution was also prepared by vigorous stirring
at 330 °C. The Ni–TOP solution was added to 5 g of TOPO
solution at once, and then the complex solution was maintained for
30 min. The reaction was stopped by cooling to room temperature. The
nanoparticles were isolated by the addition of 30 mL of ethanol and
5 mL of chloroform, followed by centrifugation. The c-Ni2P nanoparticles were synthesized by injecting a 0.357 M Ni–TOP
solution to a TOPO solution, prepared by stirring at 330 °C.
Then, the reaction was kept for 30 min. The temperature was increased
up to 315 °C because of the endothermic reaction and washed with
ethanol by centrifugation. The a-Ni2P nanoparticles were
synthesized by injecting a 0.714 M Ni–TOP solution to a TOPO
solution prepared by stirring at 330 °C. Then, the reaction was
maintained for 30 min. The temperature was limited to 290 °C
because of the endothermic reaction of precursors and the nanoparticles
were washed with ethanol by centrifugation.

4.3 Characterization
Powder XRD data
were collected on a D/MAZX 2500V/PC (Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.15405 nm), operated for 2θ = 10–80°
with a scan rate = 2°/min. The material morphology was examined
using a field-emission TEM (JEOL JEM-2100) operated at 200 kV and
a cold field-emission SEM (Hitachi s-4800). After cycling, cells were
disassembled at an atmosphere environment to observe changes of thickness
of electrodes. The electrodes were washed several times with dimethyl
carbonate (DMC) to remove electrolyte and dried for ex situ measurement.
The thickness of five randomly selected points of dried electrodes
was measured by Vernier calipers.32 This
ex situ measurement was proved to be an efficient way to estimate
the change of volume, easily verifying the volume change behavior.
For ex situ SEM, the cells were disassembled after 23 cycles in Ar-filled
glovebox and then washed by DMC.

4.4 Electrochemical
Investigation
Electrochemical
measurements were performed on a 2016 coin-type half cell, where Li
metal foil was used as the counter electrode. The working electrodes
were fabricated using a mixture of active materials (75 wt %), super
P (15 wt %), and polyvinylidene fluoride binder (LG Chem. 10%) in N-methylpyrrolidinone. The electrolyte was 1.3 M LiPF6 in a 3:7 volume mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl
carbonate, and a microporous polyethylene film was used as a separator.
The weight of the anode materials was measured as ∼0.9 mg for
each cell. Cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox with less
than 1 ppm of both oxygen and moisture. Galvanostatic charge and discharge
cycling (WonATech WBCS 3000 battery measurement system) was performed
in a potential window from 0.02 to 3.0 V versus Li/Li+ at
current densities from 0.1 to 5 C. The EIS was measured from 1.5 MHz
to 5 mHz with an amplitude of 10 mV. The half-cells were discharged
to 0.4 V (vs Li/Li+) at 270 mA g–1, and
a constant voltage of 0.4 V was applied until the current decreased
to 27 mA g–1. Then, the cells were allowed to rest
for 3 h. Cyclic voltammograms were performed at a scanning rate of
0.2 mV s–1 between 0.02 and 3 V using an SP150 potentiostat
(BioLogic Science Instruments) with homemade three-electrode cells.
