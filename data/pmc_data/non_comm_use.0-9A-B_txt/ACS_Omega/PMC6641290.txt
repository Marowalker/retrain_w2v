Photonic
crystal (PC) materials have huge potentials as sensors
for noninvasive and real-time monitoring glucose in tears. We developed
a glucose-sensitive PC material based on monolayered colloidal crystals
(MCCs). Polystyrene nanoparticles were first self-assembled into a
highly ordered MCC, and this two-dimensional (2D) template was then
coated by a 4-boronobenzaldehyde-functionalized poly(vinyl alcohol)
hydrogel. Such a sensor efficiently diffracts visible light, whose
structural color could change from red through yellow to green, as
the glucose concentration altered from 0 to 20 mM, covering both tears’
and bloods’ physiological ranges. The sensor also represents
a rapid response within 180 s at each titration of glucose, combining
the characteristics of high accuracy and sensitivity in detecting
the glucose concentration in tears, and this intelligent sensing material
presents certain possibility for the frontier point-of-care glucose
monitoring.

==== Body
Introduction
Global burden of diabetes
mellitus is increasing worldwide year
by year, and nearly 422 million patients have been diagnosed.1 Abnormalities of glycemic control usually produce
other diseases and cause a series of complications that may even endanger
life.2 Currently, instantaneous blood glucose
self-monitoring sensors require collecting blood samples several times
a day and thus are unable to warn of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic
events in advance. Such an intermittent and minimally invasive approach
is inconvenient and results in poor patient compliance. Hence, noninvasive
and real-time detection devices were designed for the painless and
convenient reporting of the blood sugar level.3 Most of the tear glucose sensor devices rely on the use of glucose
oxidase (GOD) and production–detection process of hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2).4 During reduction–oxidation (redox) reactions, GOD can be
enzymatically converted to H2O2, which was then
detected with a chromogenic reagent or electrode to determine the
glucose concentration. Unfortunately, GOD and H2O2 could be affected by other components of the tear, especially the
electrolyte, and thus considerable efforts have been made for the
developing of nonenzymatic glucose sensors.5,6

Because interstitial fluids including saliva,7 urine,8 tears,9,10 and
sweat11 are easier to get from the
body surface, they have become the hotspot in the study of nonenzymatic
glucose monitoring. Among them, it has been confirmed that the glucose
concentration of tears is closely related to the blood glucose level,
and there is a ca. 30 min’s delay, as glucose is transported
from the blood level to the tear fluid level.12 Although the real-time tear glucose information might be later than
that in blood, there are still many advantages for tear glucose monitoring,
such as stability and accessibility of tear fluid, painless detecting,
and being pollution-free. To accomplish tear glucose monitoring, the
sensitivity and accuracy of the senor should be well controlled because
the amount of glucose in tear (0.16 ± 0.03 mM by mean in normal
individuals, and 0.35 ± 0.04 mM by mean in diabetics) is much
lower than that in blood (3.90–6.20 mM in normal individuals,
7.10–11.10 mM in postprandial normal individuals, and 11.10–30.00
mM or even higher in diabetes).13 Moreover,
as a complex composition of the body fluid, aside from water and electrolyte,
tear also contains nitrogenous compounds, sugars, oligonucleotides,
sterols, organic acids, vitamins, enzymes, and lipids,14 which can influence the detection of glucose,
and the total volume of a tear is as small as 7 ± 2 μL,15,16 meanwhile the update rate of a tear is as slow as 1.2 μL/min.17,18

The photonic crystal (PC) is an ideal material to prepare
point-of-care
type tear glucose sensors to provide vast visual detection because
of its special performance.3,19,20 Such a material possesses a periodically dielectric structure, which
selectively modulates electromagnetic waves with a certain frequency
according to Bragg’s law. One type of PC sensor was developed
by combining three-dimensionally (3D) charged crystalline colloidal
array (CCA) and hydrogels, where CCA is the array with a face-centered
cubic structure that Bragg diffracts visible light, which is electrostatically
self-assembled by monodisperse colloids, and the hydrogels were commonly
in situ polymerized of the monomer solution surrounding the CCA. Thus,
the Bragg diffraction of the 3D PC sensors shifts because of the swelling
or shrinkage of the functionalized hydrogel matrices in response to
certain external stimuli such as humidity,21 pH, and metal cations,22 and the color
changes accordingly. Various 3D PC sensors were developed based on
this method for the detection of specific analytes such as nitroaromatic
molecules,23 glucose,19 and ionic strength.24 The major
limitation of 3D PC materials is the fragility of the unstable matrices
because of the low polymer content and species. Only nonionic polymers
were utilized to fabricate 3D PC materials because the ionic force
would disorder the assembly of CCA. Recently, physically gelated hydrogel
has been employed to form an ionic 3D PC sensor.25 The physical hydrogel has a robust matrix, and thus, harsh
chemical functionalization could be done to make such materials multisensitive.
Most recently, a contact lens-based 3D PC glucose sensor has been
developed using such a physical hydrogel; however, the sensing ability
was limited because the volume change of the hydrogel was restricted
by the lens.10

Meanwhile, two-dimensionally
(2D) constructed PCs can be prepared
by self-assembling monodisperse colloids into an ordered monolayer.26 After being attached to stimuli-responsive hydrogels,
the diffraction from the 2D array can be used to monitor the hydrogel
volume change according to analytes.27,28 Hence, by
attaching glucose recognition molecules, the concentration of the
tear glucose could be visually read out by observing the perceptible
color change.29 The advantages of 2D PC
sensors include (1) independent fabrication of 2D arrays and hydrogels,
the 2D array could be either attached onto the hydrogel surfaces or
embedded into the hydrogel during polymerization; (2) the response
of the sensor can be determined by measuring the Debye ring instead
of using a spectrometer; and (3) the readout of the 2D PC sensor is
reliable because the diffracted light from the 2D material is independent
of the refractive index.30 The first 2D
PC pH sensor utilized carboxylates to immobilize counter-ions within
the hydrogel. The diffraction red shifts from 620 to 668 nm between
pH 3.22 and 7.91 as the carboxyl groups ionization increases the free
energy of mixing and swells the hydrogel.31 A 2D inverse opal polyvinylpyridine hydrogel sensor was also developed
for pH sensing via a facile spin-coating method.32 For the glucose-sensing motif, a 2D PC sensor was prepared
by attaching a monolayer of polystyrene (PS) particles with a diameter of 590 nm onto the surface
of polyacrylamide-co-acrylic acid hydrogel,33 which exhibits a rapid response to glucose and
reached the binding equilibrium within 3 min, and the structure color
of the sensor shifted from red to green as the glucose concentration
changed from 0 to 20 mM. However, the response in the physiological
range could not be distinguished by naked eye, which limited its application
in tear glucose sensing. Another 2D PC material for urine glucose
sensing was reported, which can avoid the urine-interfering elements,
but the diffraction color change could not be distinguished in low
glucose concentration.34 It’s crucial
to fabricate a sensor that reports the glucose level in the tear glucose
range with good accuracy and repeatability.

Herein, as inspired
by Asher’s previous work,20,26−28 we present a novel gelated monolayered colloidal
crystal (GMCC) PC material to monitor glucose in the tear fluid. Briefly,
two-dimensionally assembled PS colloids were embedded in a 4-boronobenzaldehyde
(4-BBA)-modified poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel (see Figure 1). During detection,
as the glucose molecule binds to borate, the PVA diols and borate
ions alter their proportion that change the hydrogel volume and thus
shift the Bragg diffraction of the GMCC. The accompanying structure
color change of the GMCC could be easily distinguished within 180
s once the glucose concentration changed, especially in the physiological
range. Furthermore, we can also measure the size of the Debye ring
to determine the change in the lattice constant of the 2D PC. Compared
with the dry chemistry method for qualitative analysis, such a GMCC
sensor is more accurate and cost-effective. Moreover, this novel sensor
provides a new approach to detect tear glucose, which is far superior
to the previously reported PC sensors with higher sensitivity and
less interference.

Results and Discussion
The work
presented here describes the combination of 4-BBA-modified
PVA hydrogel and monolayered colloidal crystal (MCC) to form a GMCC
photonic material. The MCC is constructed by spherical PS colloids
that are assembled into a generally hexagonal close-packed lattice.
A more stable GMCC was then formed via an in situ physical gelation
to couple the MCC and the PVA hydrogel. The hydrogel volume transmission
causes the MCC lattice distance change and thus accordingly the diffraction
wavelength shifts.

The monodisperse PS colloids (∼600
nm) are shown in Figure 2a; they readily self-assembled
into an ordered close-packed hexagonal monolayer structure (Figure 2b). Figure 2c shows a 2D MCC covered with
freshly prepared PVA hydrogel; the structure of the MCC stayed stable
after gelation and a GMCC was thus formed. The interstices between
neighboring colloids are filled with PVA hydrogel, which indicates
that the MCC was embedded in the hydrogel matrix. In Figure 2d, a non-close-packed MCC with
PVA hydrogel was observed, and the distance between the colloids enlarged
because of the swollen hydrogel.

particles, (b) hexagonal
closely packed MCC on glass slide, (c) monolayered PS covered with
freshly prepared PVA hydrogel, and (d) non-close-packed 2D MCC on
top of PVA hydrogel swollen in water and then quenched in liquid nitrogen.
The scale bars are 1 μm in length.

Because 2D MCC has ordered repeating units around hundreds
of nanometers,
this periodic structure is able to strongly diffract visible light.
Alternatively, the diffracted light could easily be observed by illuminating
the 2D crystal with a flashlight at a normal angle, a convenient method
to confirm the 2D array and its interparticle spacing. A diffraction
of 6-spot symmetry will be shown when illuminated with monochromatic
laser light if the colloids form a perfect hexagonal MCC. Actually,
the MCC exposed in laser beam is randomly oriented because the crystallites
are significantly smaller than the beam; thus, many symmetry spots
with the same diffraction diameter will form a ring, and such pattern
is called a Debye diffraction ring.35 We
excite the GMCC along its normal with a 445 nm laser pointer. As expected,
the 2D PC diffracts the laser light, and a sharp circle was observed
(Figure 3a). The spacing
of the colloids in the GMCC can be calculated by the following formula,
and the related parameters can be clarified in Figure 3b 1  where
λ is the incident wavelength, d is the nearest-neighboring
colloids spacing, h is the distance between the GMCC
sample and the screen, and D is the diameter of the
Debye diffraction ring on the screen.
Hence, we can easily determine the concentration of the analytes by
measuring the spacing of the colloids embedded inside the GMCC hydrogel.
The method only requires a laser pointer and a ruler, as illustrated
in Figure 3b.

detection.

Tear is a complex solution containing
various components which
can influence the detection of specific analytes; artificial tear
fluid (ATF) was prepared according to the constituents of human tear;
and the prepared ATF was adjusted to pH 7.4 to simulate the real detection
conditions.36,37 We noticed that the diffraction
of the PVA GMCC film blue-shifted as the cross-linking reaction time
was extended because the cross-link density strongly influences the
equilibrium hydrogel volume, that is, the sensitivity of the hydrogel
sensor. In this study, the GMCCs were cross-linked in GA solutions
for 0 to 4 h. The obtained GMCCs were immersed in ATF solutions with
different glucose concentrations for 15 min to reach the swelling
equilibrium; the hydrogel films were taken out; and the diameters
of the Debye diffraction ring were measured. The spacing of the PS
colloids can be calculated according to eq 1.

Figure 4 shows the
dependence of the GMCC sensitivity on the gelation time. After 15
min of adsorption in the ATFs with different glucose concentrations,
the GMCCs were taken out and placed directly beneath a 445 nm laser
pointer. By measuring the diameter of the Debye ring and calculating
the interparticle spacing according to eq 1, the response for different GMCCs was traced
out. For the original GMCC hydrogel, without GA cross-linking, the
spacing of the colloids changed 5 nm as the glucose concentration
increased from 0 to 1 mM; however, the hydrogel could not maintain
its mechanical strength for further detection. For the GMCC cross-linked
for 0.5 and 1 h, the interparticle spacing narrowed from 915 to 784
nm (131 nm) and from 867 to 775 nm (92 nm), respectively, as the glucose
concentration increased from 0 to 10 mM. While the GMCC cross-linked
for 2 and 4 h, the spacing of the colloids changed from 792 to 767
nm (25 nm) and from 740 to 731 nm (9 nm), respectively. It is worth
noticing that for the GA cross-linked GMCCs, there is an inflexion
point at around 10 mM glucose with a narrowest interparticle spacing,
before which the spacing narrowed as the glucose concentration increased
and after which the spacing enlarged following the increase of the
concentration of glucose. However, it’s not a disturbing result
considering that the physiological concentration of tear glucose range
is from 0.1 to 0.6 mM, far to reach the inflexion point of our GMCCs.
The result indicated that the GA cross-linking strengthened the PVA
hydrogel matrix so that the GMCC could shift its volume in complex
chemical solutions, and the hydrogel sensors’ glucose response
decreased as the cross-linking time increased. The inset of Figure 4 plots the interparticle
spacing change of original GMCC to the cross-linking time. It is found
that the nearest spacing of the GMCC sample revealed a substantial
decrease over the first 2 h, indicating that the formation of cross-linking
points by GA shrank the system volume. Such shrinkage leveled off
after 2 h, and the cross-linked hydrogels stopped decreasing after
4 h of gelation, which probably indicates that the GMCC reached its
highest cross-linking density within 4 h. Thus, we chose the 0.5 h
cross-linked GMCC hydrogel as the optimal material to measure the
glucose concentration, whose glucose sensitivity and mechanical strength
were satisfactory.

of
GMCCs prepared with different cross-linking times in ATF. Inset is
the dependence of interparticle spacing of GMCC upon cross-linking
time. Error bars indicate standard deviations.

For the optimized GMCC, we further investigated its glucose
response
ability in the tear glucose range (ca. 0.1–0.6 mM). As described
in Figure 5a, the particle
spacing narrowed from 915 to 878 nm as the glucose concentration increased
from 0.1 to 0.6 mM, where a 37 nm linear spacing shifting was found
with the increased glucose concentration (inset of Figure 5a). The corresponding visible
color change is also displayed in Figure 5a, where we found that initially the GMCC
was red, which gradually blue-shifted with the changing glucose concentration.
As the glucose concentration increased to 0.6 mM, a reddish yellow
diffraction was observed, while the color could change to green with
the concentration of glucose increased to 10 mM. Figure 5b shows the diffraction wavelength
shifting of the GMCC recorded by a fiber optic spectrometer; the diffracted
wavelength shifted from 623 to 598 nm when titrated by glucose, which
matches the interparticle spacing change (from 915 to 878 nm) measured
from the Debye diffraction diameter in Figure 5a correspondingly (cf. eq 1). Obviously, there is a linear correlation
between the diffraction wavelength and the glucose concentration at
the settled physiological range. Figure 5b also claimed the stable intensity of the
diffracted wavelength detected at a settled distance as the diffraction
wavelength shifted. Considering the 2D structure of GMCCs, only 20%
energy of the incident light was lost as it went through the particles
and then diffracted.

yellow, to green, and the scale bars are 1 cm in length. The inset
shows a linear stop-band shifting with the increasing glucose concentration
(0.1–0.6 mM). (b) GMCC response to glucose in the diffraction
wavelength. A linear stop-band shifting with the increasing glucose
concentration (0.1–0.6 mM) is also shown in the inset figure.

According to Flory’s theory,38 during the swelling process of the polymer network,
the total osmotic
pressure πt of a gel is the sum of three contributions 2  where πmix is the osmotic
pressure due to polymer–solvent mixing, πel is the osmotic pressure caused by deformation of network chains
to a more elongated state, and πion is the osmotic
pressure due to the Donnan potential arising from the nonuniform distribution
of mobile counter-ions between the hydrogel and the solution. The
Donnan potential is negligible because the artificial tear fluid is
a high ionic strength solution, πion can be ignored,
and πmix is taken as the pressure difference inside
and outside the gel, which causes the osmotic pressure at equilibrium,
πmix + πel = 0, that is, the swelling
or shrinkage of the hydrogel.

We also investigated the reversibility
of the GMCC sensor’s
response to glucose. The 2D sensors were exposed to glucose in ATF
followed by washing with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) to remove
the combined molecules. The GMCC revealed completely reversible swelling/shrinking
ability over eight cycles to 10 mM glucose in ATF (Figure 6a). Boronates are known to
readily bind to species with appropriately situated vicinal alcohol
functional groups such as sugars.39,40 The mechanism
of phenylboronic molecule reaction with glucose involves (Scheme S2) (1) boronic acid bind glucose both
in its neutral trigonal form; (2) hydroxylation of phenylboronic molecules
in alkaline solution, and OH– attacked B atom, leading
a conformation transition of phenylboronic molecule into tetrahedral
anion; and (3) the forming tetrahedral anions of phenylboronic molecules
combined with carbohydrate molecules to form five-membered or six-membered
cyclic complexes, which could be easily hydrolyzed in acidic solution
to recover to boronic acid compounds and carbohydrate molecules. Therefore,
the response of the whole sensing process is reversible. We consider
the following equilibrium of boric acid–base 3  where BH is boric acid and B is the borate
ion with association constant Ka.

Figure 6 (a) Reversibility
of GMCC interparticle spacing changes to glucose
concentration of 10 mM. (b) Time dependence of spacing of colloids
in response to different concentrations of glucose.

The equilibria involved glucose binding by boronic
acid compounds
in both trigonal and tetrahedral forms. Within the 4-BBA–PVA
hydrogel, borate ions form 2:1 and 1:1 complexes with glucose, which
can be estimated in the following effective equilibria 4   5  

Using the total concentration
of boronic acid sites within the
GMCC, we can calculate the concentration of glucose–boronate
cross-links as 6  

Figure 6b demonstrates
the response kinetics of our GMCC sensor upon the glucose concentration.
The diffraction wavelength was recorded at different times. For 0.6
mM glucose ATF, the binding equilibrium can be reached within 200
s under gentle agitation, which was appropriate for the practical
application. Similar response kinetics was observed for 10 mM glucose
ATF, and the sensor may find other applications beyond tear glucose.
Furthermore, in contrast to traditional 3D PC sensors, the 2D GMCC
readout is intrinsically more sensitive and reliable because the 2D
diffracted wavelength is independent of the refractive index.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel GMCC sensor for the semiquantitative detection
of tear glucose was constructed by embedding 2D PS MCC into a 4-BBA-functionalized
PVA hydrogel. Such a sensor had a fantastic glucose detective sensitivity
by a facile preparation. The volumetric change of GMCC, actually the
spacing of the PS colloids relating to glucose combination, could
be predicted by both Debye diffraction ring and diffracted color.
Present results indicate that increasing the glucose concentration
can induce the shrinking of GMCC, which is a boundary for certain
degrees of tear glucose under physiological conditions. Because of
its reaction mechanism, GMCC can specifically aim at glucose molecule
though interfered by other analytes in the tear. It has great potential
in replacing finger-prick diabetes test, and it might inspire the
design of other intelligent sensors.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Materials
PVA (99% hydrolyzed, DP = 1750
± 50) was purchased from Shanghai Chemical Agent Co., Ltd. Monodisperse
PS latex (∼600 mn, 20 wt % in water) was purchased from Aladdin
Co., Ltd. All other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ·cm) is used
in all experiments. The glassware used in experiments was cleaned
with RCA solution (5:1:1 mixture of water, hydrogen peroxide (30%)
and ammonia (28%)) at 75 °C for 30 min. All materials were used
as received without further purification.

Preparation of Monolayer
Colloidal Crystal (MCC)
The
PS latex was mixed with 1-propanol at a ratio of 1:3 in volume. The
resultant suspension was then injected onto the pure water surface
through a 10 μL micropipette in a Petri dish, and PS self-assembled
into MCC rapidly on the air–liquid interface. Then, the MCC
was gently lifted up with a glass slide. After the solvent was removed
by evaporation, the sample was treated in an oven at 80 °C for
2 h.

Preparation of Glucose-Responsive GMCC
Typically, a
10 wt % homogeneous solution was prepared by dissolving PVA powder
(10.0 g) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 100 °C for 2 h in the
atmosphere of N2. Then, 4-BBA (0.4 g) and drops of HCl
were added for reaction (cf. Scheme S1).
The resulting 4-BBA–PVA solution was cooled down and poured
onto the MCC containing glass slide, and another glass slide was covered
onto the sample with a two-layer Parafilm (∼250 μm thick)
spacer. This set of slides was frozen at −20 °C for 2
h to form physical hydrogel and thawed at 25 °C for 1 h, and
then the upper slide was removed and the hydrogel-MCC was peeled off
and stored in 40 mL DMSO. After that, 10% glutaraldehyde (GA, 1.5
mL) was added as a cross-linker and the pH of the system was adjusted
to 1 by adding concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The cross-linking reaction lasted for 4 h under slight stirring,
and the resultant glucose-detective GMCC was washed with water to
remove unreacted molecules.

Characterization of PC Materials
To observe the microstructure
of the GMCC, the samples were cut into 1 × 1 cm pieces as required
and quenched in liquid nitrogen and sputter-coated a thin layer of
Au; structural and morphological characterizations of the crystals
were conducted using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi,
S-4800) operating at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. Optical micrographs
of the GMCC are taken by using a digital camera (Canon, EOS 6D). We
quantify the stop-band of GMCC by measuring the diffraction spectra
using a fiber optic spectrometer (Ocean Optics, USB 4000-XR1-ES).
Spectra were captured between the wavelengths of 400 and 900 nm. The
diffraction characteristic could be accurately predicted through Bragg’s
relationship 7  where m is the order of diffraction,
λ0 is the diffracted wavelength in air, d is the nearest spacing of the monolayered colloids, and θ
is the angle between the diffracted light and the normal to the GMCC;
during detection, the θ is adjusted to ∼19° so that
the observed diffraction is located in the visible spectral region.
Also, Debye diffraction rings were analyzed by a laser pointer to
prove its 2D ordering. To characterize the in vitro glucose-responsive
properties of the 2D GMCC, glucose was dissolved in the ATF (6.78
g/L NaCl, 2.18 g/L NaHCO3, 1.38 g/L KCl, 0.084 g/L CaCl2·2H2O, 3.94 g/L albumin, pH 7.4) in the concentration
range from 0 to 20 mM to simulate human environment, and the sensors
were first hydrolyzed in PBS solution (pH 9.0) and then immersed in
50 mL ATF solutions at room temperature. The Debye diffraction ring
or the diffraction wavelength was recorded after a certain period
of time. As an average data, every point was a mean value of five
samples under the same condition.
