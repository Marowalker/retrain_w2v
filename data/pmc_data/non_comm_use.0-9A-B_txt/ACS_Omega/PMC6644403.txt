Nanocolumnar
Si substrates (porous silicon (PSi)) have been functionalized
with a quinoxaline-bridged (EtQxBox) cavitand in which the quinoxaline
moieties are bonded to each other through four ethylendioxy bridges
at the upper rim of the cavity. The receptor, which is known to selectively
complex aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) even in the presence
of aliphatic compounds, has been covalently anchored to PSi. The larger
surface area of PSi, compared to that of flat substrates, allowed
one to study the recognition process of the surface-grafted receptors
through different techniques: Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,
thermal desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The experiments
proved that surface-grafted cavitands retain the recognition capability
toward aromatic VOCs. In addition, the affinities of EtQxBox for various
aromatic compounds (i.e., benzene, toluene, nitrobenzene, and p-nitrotoluene) have been studied combining density functional
theory computations and thermal desorption experiments. Computational
data based on the crystal structures of the complexes indicate that
this cavitand possesses a higher affinity toward aromatic nitro-compounds
compared to benzene and toluene, making this receptor of particular
interest for the detection of explosive taggants. The results of computational
studies have been validated also for the surface-grafted receptor
through competitive recognition experiments. These experiments showed
that EtQxBox-functionalized PSi can recognize nitrobenzene in the
presence of a significant excess of aromatic vapors such as benzene
(1:300) or toluene (1:100).

Introduction
The detection of volatile
nitroaromatic compounds is an area of
active research, particularly regarding environmental monitoring and
social security.1 Among nitroaromatics,
nitrobenzene (NB) and 4-nitrotoluene (NT) are molecules of particular
interests because NB, which is widely used in organic industries,
is considered a highly polluting substance due to its toxicity, carcinogenicity,
and biological persistence,2 whereas NT
is an explosive taggant.3

Previous
papers reported the detection of these nitroaromatic compounds
adopting different analytical techniques such as liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry,4−6 spectrophotometry,7 chromatography,8 fluorescence quenching methods,9,10 electrochemical methods,11 surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy,12,13 and using various organic and
inorganic materials such as metallic nanoparticles,2,14 metal–organic
frameworks,15−17 polymers,18 carbon nanostructures,19,20 and self-assembled monolayers.21,22 General overviews
of nitroaromatic detection approaches can be found in some recent
reviews.23−25 Although all of these methods allow the detection
of NB at low concentrations, they often require complex instruments
and time-consuming sample preparations and, in some cases, suffer
from low selectivity or lack of reversibility. On the contrary, detection
methods based on supramolecular receptors (such as quinoxaline-bridged
and iptycene-roofed cavitands for aromatic volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) or higher iptycenes for nitrocompound detection26−28) have recently been explored as alternatives to classical approaches
for a fast and easy recognition of the presence of aromatic contaminants.29−35 Conformationally mobile quinoxaline-based cavitand (QxCav, Chart 1)36 showed remarkable selectivity and sensitivity for the detection
of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) in air.29 The complexation properties of this receptor
are due to the presence of a deep, hydrophobic cavity capable of engulfing
aromatic rings, interacting with them via a set of CH···π
and π-stacking interactions.33 These
complexation proprieties are retained after the covalent anchoring
of this receptor on different surfaces (i.e., Si and ZnO).37,38 Recently, a new conformationally rigid quinoxaline cavitand (EtQxBox)
delimited by four quinoxaline walls linked via ethylendioxy bridges
(Chart 1) was synthetized.39 This new receptor exhibits an enhanced trapping
efficiency for BTEX compared to the parent QxCav receptor in air.
Moreover, the conformational rigidity of this cavitand maximizes the
binding of toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (TEX) with respect to
benzene by increasing the number and strength of their synergistic
CH···π interactions.39

Chart 1 Chemical Structures of the Cavitands Discussed in this Study
However, the use of cavitands
as bulk material limits the degree
of miniaturization achievable and, in addition, it can affect the
receptor selectivity due to residual nonspecific adsorptions at the
solid–gas interface. On the contrary, one of the limitations
of the use of monolayers on flat substrates is related to the low
surface area and, in turn, to the low amount of material involved
in the recognition process, thus jeopardizing sensitivity. A possible
solution to these limitations is the deposition of receptor monolayers
on high surface area substrates.40−42

Herein, we report
on the covalent anchoring of a specifically designed
EtQxBox cavitand to columnar porous silicon (PSi) through hydrosilylation
of the undecylenic feet decorating the lower rim of the receptor.
The high surface area of PSi allowed us to study the heterogeneous
recognition process of the surface-grafted receptors versus aromatic
analytes through different analytical techniques: Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal desorption, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). An unprecedented selectivity of EtQxBox@PSi toward
nitroaromatic compounds compared to benzene and toluene has been assessed
and rationalized combining thermal desorption experiments with a density
functional theory (DFT) approach.

Results and Discussion
Material
Synthesis and Characterization
The desired
cavitand was prepared following a step-by-step synthetic approach,
starting from resorcinarene Res [C10H19, H]
(Scheme 1) presenting
four terminal double bonds at the lower rim, essential for the grafting
of the cavitand onto porous silicon.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of EtQxBox
Resorcinarene Res [C10H19, H] was obtained
from the standard condensation of resorcinol and undecylenic aldehyde
in acidic conditions;43 Res [C10H19, H] was reacted in anhydrous conditions with four
equivalents of 2,3-dicloro-5,8-dimethoxyquinoxaline A, in a microwave reactor, in the presence of K2CO3 as the base and dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent, affording
the octamethoxy-quinoxaline cavitand 1 in good yields.
The subsequent reaction step was the deprotection of the methoxy groups
to have four couples of neighboring free OHs on the quinoxaline ring
for cavity rigidification by the introduction of four ethylendioxy
bridges. In a previously reported procedure,39 the deprotection of the methoxy groups of quinoxaline was performed
by aluminum trichloride in anhydrous toluene. In this case, the presence
of the four double bonds at the lower rim of the resorcinarene is
not compatible with the use of AlCl3 as a deprotecting
agent. Therefore, new deprotection conditions were elaborated to preserve
the presence of the four double bonds. The deprotection of cavitand 1 was performed in two steps. The first one consisted in the
oxidative elimination of the eight methoxy groups by cerium ammonium
nitrate, leading to the tetraquinone-quinoxaline cavitand 2. Crude 2 was purified by column chromatography, and
the deprotection was confirmed through 1H NMR by the disappearance
of the methoxy signal. Owing to its low stability, cavitand 2 was immediately used in the next step, which consisted in
the reduction of the quinone groups by sonication in the presence
of metallic zinc (reducing agent) and acetic acid (proton donor) to
give cavitand 3. The final reaction step was the rigidification
of the cavitand via introduction of four ethylendioxy groups bridging
the eight OH moieties at the upper rim. Cavitand 3 was
reacted in dry conditions under microwave irradiation with ethylene
glycol ditosylate in the presence of anhydrous Cs2CO3 as base and dry DMF as solvent, affording the desired EtQxBox
cavitand in 50% yield (Figure S1).

PSi functionalization was performed through thermal hydrosilylation
of the EtQxBox terminal double bonds at the lower rim, following a
reported procedure.44 FTIR and XPS were
carried out to characterize porous silicon slides (PSi) functionalized
with EtQxBox receptors (EtQxBox–PSi). Figure 1 compares the following FTIR spectral regions
of bare PSi (black line) and EtQxBox–PSi (red line): (a) the
C–H stretching region between 3200 and 2700 cm–1; (b) the Si–H stretching region between 2300 and 2000 cm–1; and (c) the region between 1500 and 950 cm–1, which contains SiOx and C–O
stretching vibrations. The EtQxBox–PSi spectrum shows two strong
bands due to the CH2 symmetric (νs(CH2)) and antisymmetric (νa(CH2))
stretches at 2852 and 2928 cm–1 and a lower band
at 3050 cm–1 assigned to the aromatic C–H
(ν(CH)) stretches of the cavitand.44 The presence of these bands, combined with the absence of the analogue
ones in the PSi spectrum, indicates that the receptor is grafted to
the PSi surface. In the spectrum of bare PSi, three distinct signals
at 2085, 2107, and 2267 cm–1, due to SiH, SiH2, and SiH3 stretches, respectively, are present.45 After EtQxBox anchoring, these SiHx peaks broaden
slightly and decrease, leading to a single broad band, as a result
of the hydrosilylation reaction, which causes the partial replacement
of Si–H terminations with Si–C bonds. In addition, the
low broad band at 2251 cm–1 observed in the EtQxBox–PSi
spectrum can be assigned to the OSi–Hx stretches of the partially
oxidized silicon substrate.46 The 1500–950
cm–1 region of the EtQxBox–PSi spectrum shows
two bands at 1172 and 1272 cm–1 attributed to the
aromatic C–O bond of the ethylendioxy bridges. In addition,
the EtQxBox–PSi spectrum shows also some features in the 1500–1300
cm–1 region associated with the breathing modes
of the aromatic ring. All of these features are not detectable in
the PSi spectrum.

Figure 1 FTIR spectral regions in the 3200–2700 cm–1 (left), 2300–2000 cm–1 (middle), and 1500–950
cm–1 (right) ranges of bare PSi (black line) and
EtQxBox–PSi (red line).

XPS characterization gives further indication of the success
of
the anchoring process. XPS C 1s and N 1s spectral regions of PSi and
EtQxBox–PSi samples are shown in Figure 2. The C 1s spectrum of PSi (Figure 2a) mainly consists of a component
centered at 285.0 eV due to adventitious carbon and a low shoulder
around 286.0 eV due to oxidized adventitious carbons. The EtQxBox–PSi
spectrum (Figure 2b)
consists of three main components. The first component, centered at
285.0 eV, represents aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, whereas
the second one, centered at 286.5 eV, can be attributed to the carbon
in the cavitand phenyl ring bonded to one oxygen. Note that the possible
formation of Si–O–C groups due to the reaction between
Si–H and Si–OH termination with oxidized carbon species
can contribute to this latter component. The third component at 287.6
eV is due to quinoxaline carbons that bond both oxygen and nitrogen
atoms. The N 1s spectrum of EtQxBox–PSi (Figure 2d) consists of a main band centered at 399.9
eV due to the nitrogens of the quinoxaline rings.47 A much less intense side component at 401.1 eV could be
due to protonated N atoms or forming H bonds. The presence of these
bands, combined with the absence of the analogue signals on PSi (Figure 2c), is a clear evidence
of the grafting of EtQxBox on the surface.

Complexation Studies
Crystal Structure of NT@EtQxBox
To evaluate
the inclusion ability of EtQxBox toward nitroaromatic compounds, the
crystal structure of complex NT@EtQxBox·10DMSO was determined
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods (Figure S2). This complex was obtained by slow evaporation of a dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) solution of hexyl-footed EtQxBox39 and NT from a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio mixture. Crystallographic
details for the structures are reported in the Supporting Information, Table S1.

Different views of the molecular
structure are shown in Figure 3, whereas geometrical details of the interactions responsible
for the complex formation are given in Figure S3 and Table S2. NT enters the cavity with the methyl group,
which interacts with the aromatic walls at the lower rim of the host
via two C–H···π interactions, dictating
the orientation of the guest into the cavity. These interactions are
strengthened by the presence of the nitro substituent on the aromatic
ring, which renders the methyl group more “acidic”.
The guest is further stabilized by the presence of two bifurcated
C–H···N weak H bonds involving the aromatic
hydrogen atoms ortho to the methyl group and the nitrogen atoms of
two quinoxaline rings (see Figure S3 and Table S2). The nitro group does not interact with the cavity rim.

have been omitted for clarity. The guest is represented in space-filling
mode.

Nitroaromatic Vapor Complexation
by EtQxBox–PSi
The affinity of the cavitand-grafted
silicon surfaces toward aromatic
compounds has been evaluated by exposing EtQxBox–PSi to either
NB (about 30 Pa) or NT (about 15 Pa) vapors calculated according to
the Antoine equation.48 The detection of
the surface-complexed molecules was performed using both XPS and FTIR
techniques. In addition, a control reference surface (Ref-PSi) was
prepared and similarly exposed to the nitroaromatic vapors. Ref-PSi
consisted of a PSi surface functionalized with an inactive organic
monolayer formed by a mixture (4:1) of 1-dodecene and a linear naphtyridine,
the 2,7-diamido-1,8-naphthyridine.49 The
mixed alkene/naphtyridine monolayer was chosen for its elemental composition
(C/N/O = 14:1:0.5) similar to that of EtQxBox (C/N/O = 13.5:1:2).

Figure 4a shows the
evolution of EtQxBox–PSi FTIR spectra in the 1800–1200
cm–1 range after exposure to NB or NT vapors. The
spectrum of Ref-PSi after NB exposure has been reported as reference.
The spectra of EtQxBox–PSi after exposure to the analytes show
the characteristic bands at 1345 and 1523 cm–1 associated
with the asymmetric and symmetric N–O stretching of NO2, respectively. These bands are absent in the Ref-PSi spectrum
under the same conditions (Figure 4a bottom), indicating that surface-bound EtQxBox is
needed for the recognition and that nonspecific interactions can be
neglected.

Figure 4 (a) FTIR spectra in the 1800–1200 cm–1 range of EtQxBox–PSi after exposure to NB (up) or NT (middle)
vapors. The spectrum of Ref-PSi after NB exposure (bottom) has been
added for reference. (b) Intensity variation of the 1523 cm–1 band of NO2 after cycles of absorption/desorption of
NB with EtQxBox–PSi.

The reversibility of the complexation process was then evaluated
through the FTIR monitoring of the intensity variation of NO stretches
during NB adsorption/desorption cycles. These cycles were obtained
through sample exposure to NB vapors (adsorption), followed by a mild
treatment at 80 °C under N2 flushing for 20 min (desorption).
The decrease of the feature associated with the NO2 group
down to a 20% of the maximum after the desorption step indicates that
the process operates with good reversibility (Figure 4b).

The complexation process was also
monitored by XPS. Figure 5 reports the N 1s spectral
regions of EtQxBox–PSi (Figure 5a) and Ref-PSi (Figure 5b) before and after the complexation process with NB.
After the exposure to NB, the N 1s region of EtQxBox–PSi (Figure 5a middle trace) shows
a new broad peak at ∼406.0 eV, besides the typical peak at
399.9 eV, attributable to the presence of the NO2 group
of NB in the cavity. In the case of Ref-PSi, only the N 1s band centered
at 400.0 eV assigned to the nitrogens of the 2,7-diamido-1,8-naphthyridine
is present before and after vapor exposure (Figure 5b).

and (b) Ref-PSi

The NB desorption induced by sample heating was also monitored
by XPS analysis, confirming the process reversibility observed in
the FTIR experiments (Figure 5a upper trace).

Nitroaromatic vs Aromatic Complexation at
the Gas–Solid
Interface
The complexation of benzene (104 Pa),
NB (30 Pa), and NT (15 Pa) vapors on EtQxBox–PSi slides and
their thermal desorption under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions
(total pressure = 10–8 Torr) were studied by in
situ mass spectrometry. Various ions associated with the fragmentation
of the desorbing molecules have been detected by the mass spectrometer
during the heating of the substrate (Figure 6). In the case of benzene desorption, the
molecular C6H6+ (main ion) ion and
the C6H5+ fragment (<20%) start
to desorb below 50 °C, and the desorption is completed at about
150 °C.

Figure 6 Thermal desorption experiments of EtQxBox–PSi (left)
and
Ref-PSi (right) after the adsorption of benzene (up) and NB (bottom).

In the case of NB, the complexation
is proved by the desorption
of the C6H5+ fragment, which in this
case is the most intense, whereas the observed molecular C6H5NO2+ ion is about 30% of the main
fragment. Note that the desorption temperature range of NB is broader
than the one observed for benzene. The same trend is observed for
the thermal desorption of NT (Figure S4). Similar experiments performed on the inert Ref-PSi slides showed
a minimal uptake of the guests, further confirming that the presence
of the cavitand on the surface is essential for the aromatic compound
complexation.

To evaluate the different affinities of EtQxBox–PSi
toward
aromatic and nitroaromatic compounds, a set of experiments with simultaneous
adsorptions of vapors of NB/benzene (1:300 ratio) and of NB/toluene
(1:100 ratio) was performed. The comparison between benzene and NB
adsorption emphasizes the effects on the cavitand–arene complex
if a nitro group is added to the aromatic ring. On the contrary, through
experiments adopting toluene and NB mixtures, the role of the two
substituents can be compared. After the adsorption of the benzene/NB
mixture, the main ions observed during the thermal desorption were
C6H5+, which is the most intense
peak arising from NB fragmentation, and the C6H5NO2+ molecular ion (Figure 7). Despite the large excess of benzene in
the gas phase, only a reduced amount of benzene (peak C6H6+) was released during heating. Note that
the contribution of benzene to the intensity of the fragment C6H5+ is below 10% because the amount
of this ion, deriving from benzene fragmentation, is less than 20%
of C6H6+. This experiment has shown
that NB is preferentially complexed with respect to benzene by EtQxBox–PSi.
It therefore indicates that the addition of the nitro group to the
aromatic ring increases the stability of the cavity–arene complex.

Figure 7 Thermal
desorption experiments of EtQxBox–PSi (up) and Ref-PSi
(bottom) after the adsorption of (left) benzene/NB (300:1) and (right)
toluene/NB (100:1) mixtures.

During thermal desorption after toluene/NB exposure, the
characteristic
toluene ions (i.e., C7H8+ e C7H7+) and the NB C6H5NO2+ and C6H5+ ions are clearly present.

Despite the excess of toluene in
the gas phase, the amount of adsorbed
NB is comparable to that of the adsorbed toluene, suggesting a higher
affinity of EtQxBox toward NB. However, in this case, the gap is less
marked when compared to that of the benzene/NB mixture.

Rationalization
of the Observed Selectivity via a DFT Study
DFT calculations
of the insertion of aromatic compounds inside
the EtQxBox cavity were performed to rationalize the higher affinity
of the cavitand toward nitroaromatics compared to that toward simple
aromatic hydrocarbons. In particular, complex formation with benzene,
toluene, NB, and NT is compared. In all cases, deep insertion of the
aromatic moiety into the cavity is observed (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Optimized structures for the host–guest
complex between
aromatic guests and the EtQxBox cavitand: (a) benzene@EtQxBox; (b)
NB@EtQxBox; (c) toluene@EtQxBox; and (d) NT@EtQxBox.

Benzene and toluene insert deeper than the respective
nitro derivatives
(see also the corresponding crystal structures in ref (39)). In the case of toluene,
both orientations of the methyl group with respect to the cavity are
energetically accessible, but the one with the methyl group protruding
outside the cavity is preferred (Figure 8c). The nitro group is always positioned
outside the cavity (Figure 8b,d).

The host–guest formation is in all cases
exothermic and
exoergonic (Figure 9). The stabilization energies are mostly due to the CHguest···πhost and CHguest···Nhost interactions, as also evidenced by the NT@EtQxBox crystal
structure. In the cases of NB and NT, a further stabilizing contribution
of about 7 kcal/mol, compared to benzene and nitrobenzene, respectively,
is ascribable to the dipole–dipole interaction between the
nitroaromatics and EtQxBox (Figure S5).
The much higher affinity of the cavity toward NB compared to benzene,
observed in the adsorption/desorption experiments, is due to this
difference. Smaller differences are observed in the adsorption affinity
between NB and toluene, as confirmed by the calculated lower energy
gap (about 3 kcal/mol) between the host–guest complexes. In
the case of toluene, the lack of the dipole–dipole stabilization
due to the nitro group is partially balanced by the formation of the
CHguest···πhost interactions
of the methyl group.39 The process is entropy
opposed due to the confinement of the guest inside the cavity. In
fact, we found that Gibbs free energy values are always 13–16
kcal/mol higher than the respective enthalpy values (at 298 K). The
entropic loss is quantified in about 13–16 kcal/mol in the
gas phase.

Conclusions
In this work, we report
the synthesis, characterization, and complexation
properties of a new organic–inorganic hybrid material based
on a porous silicon surface decorated with a conformationally rigid
quinoxaline-bridged cavitand. The recognition properties of EtQxBox
toward aromatic VOCs have been transferred to the silicon surface.
The success of the grafting protocol has been demonstrated by combining
different analytic techniques (XPS and FTIR). Reversible host–guest
complexation of aromatic and nitroaromatic compounds on the functionalized
porous surface has been evaluated by XPS, FTIR, and desorption experiments.
We demonstrated through the combination of experimental results and
DFT modeling that the affinity of the EtQxBox–PSi system toward
nitroaromatic compounds is significantly higher than the one toward
benzene because of the stabilizing contribution due to the dipole–dipole
interaction.

1 g (9.61 × 10–4 mol) of resorcinarene
Res [C10H19, H] was dissolved in 50 mL of dry

ditosylate (106 mg, 2.86 × 10–4 mol) were added
under nitrogen. The mixture was reacted in a microwave reactor at
120 °C for 1.5 h. The crude was extracted with CH2Cl2/H2O, dried over sodium sulfate, and evaporated.
The compound was purified by preparative thin layer chromatography
(SiO2, acetone 100%), affording the desired compound as
a bright yellow solid, in 50% yield. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): 8.31 (s, 4H, Hup), 7.55 (s, 4H, Hdown), 6.74 (s, 8H, ArHQuin), 5.88 (m, 4H, −CH=CH2), 5.81 (t, 4H, ArCH–R, J3 = 7.6 Hz), 5.04 (m, 8H, −CH=CH2), 4.64–4.50
(m, 16H, ArOCH2CH2OAr), 2.11 (m, 8H, −ArCH–CH2−), 1.32 (m, 56H, −CH2−).
MALDI-MS: m/z = calculated for C108H113N8O16 [M + H]+ 1777.82745, found 1777.8230, calculated for C108H112N8NaO16 [M + Na]+ 1799.8094,
found 1799.8094 [M + Na]+.

PSi Preparation
PSi has been prepared by wet metal-assisted
chemical etching according to a published method.39,ref40 In particular, Czochralski-grown, p-type Si(100) slides having a
resistivity of 1.5–4 Ω cm were treated for 5 min with
an hydrofluoric acid (HF) (0.14 M) and AgNO3 (5 ×
10–4 M) water solution. After the deposition of
Ag particles, the slides were dipped in HF, H2O2, and H2O (40% HF/30% H2O2/H2O 25:10:4 v/v) solution for 1 min and then rinsed with Milli-Q
water and dried under N2 flow.

Cavitand Grafting
For grafting on porous substrates,
the etched PSi was dipped in a EtQxBox solution in mesitylene. The
solution was refluxed at 200 °C under N2 for 5 h;
then functionalized PSi slides were cleaned by two washing cycles
in an ultrasonic bath (5 min each) in dichloromethane.

Cavitand Complexation
Tests
Adsorption experiments
were performed by placing samples for 30 min in a closed chamber saturated
with aromatic VOC vapors. The saturated chamber at 25 °C was
obtained by placing one beaker (or two beakers for the mixtures) containing
3 mL of the aromatic compound (benzene, toluene, or NB) and allowing
vapor saturation for 4 h. The saturation of NT vapor was obtained
by placing for 2 h ∼50.0 mg of NT in a closed chamber kept
at 50 °C.

Sample Characterization
XPS spectra
were obtained with
a PHI 5600 multitechnique ESCA-Auger spectrometer equipped with a
monochromated Al Kα X-ray source. Analyses were carried out
with a photoelectron takeoff angle of 45° (relative to the sample
surface) with an acceptance angle of ±7°. The XPS binding
energy scale was calibrated by centering the C 1s peak due to hydrocarbon
moieties and “adventitious” carbon at 285.0 eV.

FTIR spectra were obtained with JASCO FTIR 430, using 100 scans per
spectrum (scan range 560–4000 cm–1, resolution
4 cm–1).

Thermal desorption experiments were
performed in a UHV chamber
(basic pressure ∼ 10–8 Torr). For the experiments,
the holder (Vacuum Science, Italy) was resistively heated with a ramp
of about 10 °C/min from 30 to 200 °C. The desorbed molecules
were detected with a Smart-IQ + (Thermo Electron Corporation) quadrupole
mass spectrometer equipped with an electron filament as ion source
and a multiplier detector (mass range 1–300).

Crystal Structure
of NT@EtQxBox
The crystal structure
of NT@EtQxBox was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods.
Intensity data and cell parameters were obtained at 190 K on a Bruker
APEX II equipped with a charge-coupled device area detector and a
graphite monochromator (Mo Kα radiation λ = 0.71073 Å).
The data reduction was carried out using the SAINT and SADABS51 programs. The structure was solved by Direct
Methods using SIR9752 and refined on Fo2 by full-matrix least-squares procedures,
using SHELXL-2014/753 in the WinGX suite
version 2014.1.54 All of the nonhydrogen
atoms were refined with anisotropic atomic displacements, with the
exclusion of some atoms belonging to the disordered DMSO lattice molecules
and of a terminal methyl carbon atom of the alkyl chain. The hydrogen
atoms were included in the refinement at idealized geometries (C–H
0.95/0.99 Å) and refined “riding” on the corresponding
parent atoms. The weighting schemes used in the last cycle of refinement
was w = 1/[σ2Fo2 + (0. 0.1232P)2 +
5.6500P], where P = (Fo2 + 2Fc2)/3. Geometric calculations were performed with the PARST97 program.55 Crystallographic data (excluding structure factors)
for the structure reported have been deposited with the Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre as supplementary publication no. CCDC-1831062
and can be obtained free of charge on application to the CCDC, 12
Union Road, Cambridge, CB2 IEZ, U.K. (fax: +44-1223-336-033; e-mail deposit@ccdc.cam.ac.uk or http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk).

Computational Details
Calculations were performed adopting
the M06 hybrid meta-generalised gradient approximation functional.56 The standard all-electron 6-31G** basis57 was used for all atoms. Molecular geometry optimization
of stationary points was carried out without symmetry constraints
and used analytical gradient techniques.58 Frequency analysis was performed to obtain thermochemical information
about the reaction pathways at 298 K using the harmonic approximation.
All calculations were performed using the G16 code59 on Linux cluster systems.
