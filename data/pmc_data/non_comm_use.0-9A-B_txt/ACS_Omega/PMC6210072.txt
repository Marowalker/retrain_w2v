Recent
network and system biology analyses suggest that most complex
diseases are regulated by robust and highly interconnected pathways
that could be better modulated by small molecules binding to multiple
biological targets. These pieces of evidence recently led to devote
efforts on identifying single chemical entities that bind to two different
disease-relevant targets. Here, we first predicted in silico and later
confirmed in vitro that UPF 1069, a known bioactive poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase-1/2 (PARP1/2) molecule, and hydroxyfasudil, a known bioactive
Rho-associated protein kinase-1/2 (ROCK1/2) molecule, have low-micromolar
cross-affinity for ROCK1/2 and PARP1/2, respectively. These molecules
can now be regarded as chemical seeds from which pharmacological tools
could be generated to study the impact of dual inhibition of PARPs
and ROCKs in preclinical models of a variety of complex diseases where
both targets are involved.

Introduction
The modulation of the activity of a specific
protein by a small
molecule is one of the cornerstones of modern target-based drug discovery.1 However, it is increasingly recognized that small-molecule
drugs often bind to multiple protein targets, a phenomenon termed
as polypharmacology that influences both drug efficacy and safety.2,3 Albeit far less commonly studied, the polypharmacology of drug metabolites
and pharmacological tools is increasingly appreciated and can have
profound implications in fundamental studies of biological systems
using small molecules as pharmacological tools.4,5 Moreover,
evidence from network and system biology analyses suggests that most
diseases are regulated by robust and highly interconnected pathways
and thus they could be better modulated using small molecules that
bind to multiple disease-relevant proteins.6,7

In this respect, there is a growing interest in designing molecules
with customized polypharmacological profiles by computational means.8 In particular, current trends point toward the
identification of dual ligands, also referred to as bispecific small
molecules, that specifically bind to two different target proteins.
Among the several publications describing the design of a bispecific
small molecule, the recent attempts to design a cytotoxic agent that
also inhibits P-glycoprotein for cancer treatment,9 a dual inhibitor of H1 and H4 that is a more effective
antihistamine,10 a dual constitutive androstane
receptor and pregnane X receptor inhibitor for studying the complex
regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes,11 and a dual AT1R antagonist and PPARγ partial agonist for the
treatment of hypertension and type 2 diabetes illustrate both the
diversity of therapeutic areas that could be better addressed with
dual inhibitors and the increasing interest in bispecific small molecule
design.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are a
new class of
therapeutics that block the DNA-repair activity of several members
of the PARP enzyme family.12,13 PARP inhibitors are
designed to compete with the substrate NAD+ and most are
inspired on the early chemical tool 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB; 1), sharing
a benzamide pharmacophore (2) that forms a hydrogen-bonding network
in the binding site of PARPs (Figure 1).14 Olaparib was the first
PARP inhibitor to receive FDA approval in 2014 for BRCA-mutated ovarian
cancer and, more recently, rucaparib and niraparib have been also
approved for this indication.12 After these
approvals, the identification of new cancer subtypes and biomarkers
that could enable an extended use of PARP inhibitors remains a highly
active field of study.12 With the increase
in the understanding of the role of PARPs in the regulation of multiple
other physiological and pathophysiological functions, including gene
transcription, cell cycle progression, and cell death, the potential
therapeutic use of PARP inhibitors beyond cancer has also been investigated.15,16 For example, it is now widely documented that extensive oxidative
or nitrosative stress leads to excessive activation of PARPs, depletion
of cellular stores of PARP’s substrate NAD, and finally to
cell death by necrosis.15 Accordingly,
PARP inhibitors could find applications in therapeutic areas that
may benefit from preventing cell death such as cardiovascular or neurodegenerative
diseases. However, the full exploitation of PARP inhibitors in the
clinic is currently hampered by our yet incomplete understanding of
both the biological functions of PARPs and the (poly)pharmacology
of PARP inhibitors.12,13 Recently, the identification
of differential kinase off-targets among PARP inhibitors has contributed
to explain some of the observed differential cellular effects and
facilitate their full exploitation for patient benefit.13,17−19

The possibility that PARP inhibitors also bind to kinase
off-targets
opens an avenue for the generation of dual PARP–kinasae inhibitors
with potential applications in various therapeutic areas. In this
respect, ROCK1 and ROCK2 are two highly homologous isoforms of Rho-associated
protein kinase (ROCK), responsible for translating the signal from
Rho GTPases into a wide diversity of functions, including cell motility,
cell proliferation, and apoptosis.20,21 Accordingly,
ROCK inhibitors have been extensively investigated in both cardiovascular
diseases and cancer, among other therapeutic areas.21 In 1995, fasudil (3) was the first ROCK inhibitor to be
approved in Japan to treat cerebral vasospasm (Figure 1).20 In humans,
fasudil is rapidly transformed to an active metabolite, hydroxyfasudil
(4, Figure 1), that
reaches similar concentrations but higher half-life time in plasma
and thus plays an important role in fasudil’s therapeutic action.22 A close look at the chemical structure of hydroxyfasudil
reveals that it contains the benzamide pharmacophore of PARP inhibitors
(Figure 1) and thus
it could potentially bind to PARPs as well.

Whereas the off-target
kinase polypharmacology of PARP inhibitors
has been identified,13,17 the potential off-target PARP
polypharmacology of kinase inhibitors remains unexplored. Most interestingly,
it has recently been reported that the Rho-kinase signaling pathway
promotes the expression of PARP to accelerate cardiomyocyte apoptosis
in ischemia and PARPs and ROCKs also participate in the same pathway
to regulate axon growth.23,24 Therefore, dual PARP–ROCK
inhibitors would be invaluable pharmacological tools to study the
many pathways in which both PARPs and ROCKs participate and could
be used as pathfinder molecules in the development of more efficacious
and robust therapeutics to modulate these pathways. These observations
prompted us to investigate further the potential cross-pharmacology
between PARP and ROCK inhibitors.

Results
Following
on the previous observation, hydroxyfasudil was processed
in silico using Chemotargets CLARITY,25 a widely used and validated predictive pharmacology platform.5,26 Apart from recovering many of the known interactions with members
of the kinase family, the results predicted a potential affinity for
the protein PARP2 based on the similarity with the micromolar PARP
inhibitor CHEMBL1767049 (5, Figure 1).27 An in vitro biochemical
test was subsequently performed to confirm that indeed hydroxyfasudil
inhibits PARP2 in a dose–response manner. Initially, hydroxyfasufil
showed 27% of PARP1 and 40% of PARP2 inhibition at 10 μM concentration
(Table 1). The dose–response
curve of the stronger interaction between hydroxyfasudil and PARP2
was subsequently calculated, yielding a final IC50 of 35.1
μM (Table 1 and Figure 2). This is an illustrative
example of how in silico pharmacology can be used to anticipate potential
off-target affinities of an active drug metabolite.

Figure 2 Dose–response
curves and IC50 calculation of
hydroxyfasudil on PARP2 (left) and UPF 1069 on ROCK1 (right) confirm
that both small molecules are dual PARP–ROCK inhibitors.

were either generated from this work or directly extracted from the
literature (in which case the corresponding literature citation is

this work.

On the basis
of the previous results,13,17 we were also intrigued
by the possibility that PARP inhibitors could
have some residual ROCK inhibition. Unfortunately, the most similar
PARP inhibitor to hydroxyfasudil, CHEMBL1767049 (Figure 1), was not commercially available.27 However, among the known PARP chemical tools
that present a 2H-isoquinolin-1-one scaffold substituted
at position 7, we found the commercially available chemical probe
UPF 1069 (6, Figure 1).28 UPF 1069 has IC50 values
of 0.1 and 1.0 μM for PARP1 and PARP2, respectively (Table 1).29 Accordingly, we tested this compound using an in vitro
biochemical assay against ROCK1 and ROCK2 and confirmed that UPF 1069
shows also 38% ROCK1 and 20.5% ROCK2 inhibition at 10 μM (Table 1). We subsequently
calculated the dose–response curve for the stronger UPF 1069–ROCK1
interaction, which yielded an IC50 of 9.3 μM (Table 1 and Figure 2).

The identification
of two small molecules with low-micromolar affinities
for PARPs and ROCKs is an important finding that confirms the existence
of a certain level of cross-pharmacology between the members of these
two protein families. However, a key question at this stage is whether
those affinities could actually have some therapeutic relevance. In
this respect, it is known that, in humans, fasudil is rapidly metabolized
to hydroxyfasudil, reaching similar peak plasma concentrations and
with a higher half-life time than fasudil.22,30,31 Specifically, hydroxyfasudil reaches peak
plasma concentrations of around 0.84–0.56 μM for continuous
infusion of 30–60 mg/min in 30–60 min.22,30,31 Hydroxyfasudil has IC50 values of 0.76 and 0.58 μM for ROCK1 and ROCK2, respectively
(Table 1).32 In contrast, the IC50 values for
PARPs are well below their peak plasma concentration (Table 1 and Figure 2). Therefore, PARP2 is unlikely to be involved
in the mechanism of action of fasudil at these clinical concentrations.
However, even though the dose of 30 mg is the more commonly used in
clinical trials, fasudil has also been investigated at 80 mg three
times daily in a phase 2 clinical trial of stable angina.33 Following the result that a dose of 80 mg was
found to be safe, this phase 2 trial recommended to explore higher
fasudil doses. Accordingly, it may be important to bear in mind in
the future that the low-micromolar PARP2 affinity of hydroxyfasudil
could become therapeutically relevant at higher clinical doses.33 In fact, it was recently demonstrated that it
is possible to redirect metabolism to increase the concentration of
desired drug metabolites in humans.34

Discussion
UPF 1069 and hydroxyfasudil could be invaluable pharmacological
tools to explore the biological relevance of simultaneous PARP–ROCK
inhibition. To gain a deeper insight into its potential therapeutic
relevance, we used the Open Targets resource35 to prioritize disease areas where both targets are involved. Open
Targets is a platform that links targets with diseases using public
and newly generated data, including text mining, genomics, and transcriptomics,
among others. Using PARP1 and ROCK1 as queries, we identified seven
therapeutic areas with more than 15 diseases each that are shared
between PARP and ROCK, illustrating the involvement of both targets
in similar diseases and processes (Figure 3). Not surprisingly, cancer (under the Open
Targets therapeutic areas of “neoplasms” and “genetic
diseases”) emerged as the therapeutic area with the highest
number of shared diseases, given the approval of PARP inhibitors in
ovarian cancer and its investigation in several other types of cancer
and the vast literature linking ROCKs to cancer.20,21 Interestingly, simultaneous inhibition of ROCKs could be beneficial
in most of the cancer types where PARP inhibitors are being investigated
in last-stage clinical trials, such as prostate and breast cancer,
mainly due to the involvement of ROCKs in extracellular matrix remodeling
and metastasis.21

Figure 3 Venn diagram of shared
therapeutic areas between PARP1 and ROCK1
extracted from the Open Targets platform.44 Font size is proportional to the number of shared diseases inside
each therapeutic area (see Materials and Methods).

Dual PARP–ROCK inhibition
could also be beneficial in several
eye diseases, including diabetic retinophaty, a serious chronic microvascular
complication of diabetes mellitus and a leading cause of blindness
in industrialized regions.36,37 ROCK1 kinase upregulation
has been implicated in the microvascular endothelial cell dysfunction
associated with diabetic retinophaty, whereas a PARP1 knockout in
mice has demonstrated the role of PARP1 in the inflammatory response
that drives this disease; thus, simultaneous inhibition of PARPs and
ROCKs could be beneficial to treat diabetic retinophaty.36,37

Nervous system diseases also emerge as complex diseases that
could
benefit from dual inhibition of PARPs and ROCKs. From this analysis,
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) emerges as a potential candidate for
a dual inhibitor of ROCKs and PARPs. On the one side, the peptide
β-amyloid (Aβ), which is itself an AD hallmark and toxic,
has been shown to also activate PARP1, leading to neuronal cell death.38 On the other side, ROCK1 has also been suggested
as a potential therapeutic target in AD, given its role in regulating
Aβ production, secretion, and post-translational modification.39 Given the high unmet need that AD represents
and the clinical failures due to the lack of efficacy of all AD therapies
investigated so far, dual inhibitors of PARPs and ROCKs could facilitate
the simultaneous study of these two therapeutic strategies in an attempt
to increase success rates. In addition, it has been recently shown
that PARP1 acts in the RhoA/ROCK pathway that inhibits axon growth
and thus the dual inhibition of PARPs and ROCKs could also facilitate
axon regrowth after acute axonal injury.24

Several cardiovascular diseases are also modulated by both
ROCKs
and PARPs, including ischemia–reperfusion injury. PARP1 hyperactivation
has long been implicated in cell death after ischemia–reperfusion
injury due to the depletion of NAD+.40 Moreover, ROCKs have been shown to reduce myocardial infarction
size and prevent cardiomyocyte apoptosis.23 Even more interestingly, a very recent study suggests that ROCKs
regulate PARP1 expression and participate in the same pathway to accelerate
cardiomyocyte apoptosis, suggesting potential synergistic effects
of dual PARP–ROCK inhibitors on blocking cell death after ischemia–reperfusion.23 To complete the list of therapeutic areas that
are shared between PARPs and ROCKs, several skin and skeletal system
diseases could also benefit from simultaneous modulation of PARPs
and ROCKs, thus highlighting the wide diversity of opportunities that
dual PARP–ROCK chemical tools could unlock toward designing
more effective therapeutics.

Conclusions
We have identified hydroxyfasudil
and UPF 1069 as interesting complementary
chemical seeds from which small-molecule tools with optimized dual
PARP–ROCK inhibition could be generated. When administered
at high concentrations, they could already be used to study the biological
relevance of dual PARP–ROCK inhibition, which could potentially
be exploited in a large number of complex therapeutic areas where
both targets are involved. We hope that these findings contribute
to increase our understanding of PARP–kinase cross-pharmacology
and unlock the design of more efficacious therapeutics that are capable
of modulating robust pathways altered in diseases of high unmet medical
need.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
Hydroxyfasudil
hydrochloride
(Catalog No. 14413) was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor,
MI), and UPF 1069 (Catalog No. S8038) was purchased from SelleckChem
(Houston, TX), both with guaranteed purity of >98%.

In Silico Target
Profiling
Chemical structures were
processed with Chemotargets CLARITY v1.0.4.25 Given the two-dimensional structure of a molecule (smiles or sd/mol
file), CLARITY returns the predicted affinities for those targets
for which ligand information is available in selected public and patent
sources of pharmacological data. Six ligand-based approaches are implemented
in CLARITY v1.0.4 that rely on molecular similarity, an implementation
of the similarity ensemble approach, fuzzy fragment-based mapping,
quantitative structure–activity relationships, machine learning
methods (including support vector machine, random forest, and neural
networks), and target cross-pharmacology.41 The method has been successfully and extensively used and validated
both retrospectively and prospectively.5,26,41

In Vitro Biochemical Assays of ROCK1 and
ROCK2 Activities
The effects of compounds on the activity
of the human ROCK1 and
ROCK2 were quantified by measuring the phosphorylation of the substrate
Ulight-RRRSLLE (PLK) using a human recombinant enzyme and the LANCE
detection method. Both assays were performed at the contract research
organization company Eurofins Pharma Discovery Services.42

The test compound, reference compound,
or water (control) were mixed with the enzyme (8.2 ng of ROCK1; 4.52
ng of ROCK2) in a buffer containing 40 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid/Tris (pH 7.4), 0.8 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl
ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid/Tris, 8 mM MgCl2,
1.6 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.008% Tween 20. Thereafter, the reaction
was initiated by adding the substrate Ulight-RRRSLLE (50 nM for ROCK1;
100 nM for ROCK2) and ATP (1 μM for ROCK1; 10 μM for ROCK2),
and the mixture was incubated (20 min for ROCK1; 15 min for ROCK2)
at room temperature. For control basal measurements, the enzyme was
omitted from the reaction mixture. Following incubation, the reaction
was stopped by adding 13 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. After
5 min, the anti-phospho-PLK antibody labeled with europium chelate
was added. After 60 more min, the fluorescence transfer was measured
at λex = 337 nm, λem = 620 nm, and
λem = 665 nm using a microplate reader (Envision,
PerkinElmer). The enzyme activity was determined by dividing the signal
measured at 665 nm by that measured at 620 nm (ratio). The results
were expressed as a percent inhibition of the control enzyme activity.
The standard inhibitory reference compound used was staurosporine,
which was tested in each experiment at several concentrations to obtain
an inhibition curve from which its IC50 value was calculated.

In Vitro Biochemical Assays of PARP1 and PARP2 Activities
Both assays were performed by following the BPS PARP assay kit
protocols.43 The enzymatic reactions were
conducted at room temperature for 1 h in a 96-well plate coated with
the histone substrate. The reaction buffer (50 μL) (Tris–HCl,
pH 8.0) contains 2.5 μM NAD+, 2.5 μM biotinylated
NAD+, 0.026 mg/mL activated DNA, the corresponding human
PARP enzyme (10 ng of PARP1, catalog number 80501 (Lot number 160524B);
25 ng of PARP2, catalog number 80502 (Lot number 140729-P4)), and
the test compound at the corresponding concentration (hydroxyfasudil
hydrochloride hydrate). After enzymatic reactions, 50 μL of
streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase was added to each well,
and the plate was incubated at room temperature for an additional
30 min. Developer reagents (100 μL) were added to wells, and
luminescence was measured using a BioTek Synergy 2 microplate reader.

The luminescence data were analyzed using computer software Graphpad
Prism. In the absence of the compound, the luminescence (Lt) in each data set was defined as 100% activity. In the
absence of the PARP, the luminescence (Lb) in each data set was defined as 0% activity. The percent activity
in the presence of each compound was calculated according to the following
equation: % activity = [(L – Lb)/(Lt – Lb)] × 100, where L is the luminescence
in the presence of the compound, Lb is
the luminescence in the absence of the PARP, and Lt is the luminescence in the absence of the compound.
The percent inhibition was calculated according to the following equation:
% inhibition = 100 – % activity.

Analysis of Therapeutic
Areas Using the Open Target Platform
PARP1 and ROCK1 were
used as queries in the Open Targets platform
website.44 Next, the number of diseases
for each therapeutic area was obtained from the resource. Only therapeutic
areas with more than 15 positively associated diseases with both PARP1
and ROCK1 were considered further. Finally, the evidence provided
in the Open Targets platform was further investigated, focusing on
the literature references that were carefully read to identify the
diseases where simultaneous inhibition of PARP1 and ROCK1 could be
beneficial.
