Polymers and transition-metal oxides
have gained great interest
as a photocatalyst in environmental remediation. They could be modified
with each other in order to improve their activity. Here, a sunlight-responsive
hierarchically structured ternary composite of nickel oxide, polyaniline,
and reduced graphene oxide (NiO@PANI/RGO) has been synthesized and
employed as a catalyst for dye [methylene blue (MB)] degradation.
PANI/GO synthesized by interfacial polymerization acts as a matrix
for the growth of NiO using a microemulsion solvothermal method, ensuing
an in situ reduction of graphene oxide during the formation of a hierarchical
NiO@PANI/RGO composite. Morphological studies of the as-synthesized
NiO@PANI/RGO composite reveal fine NiO (10 nm) nanoparticles intercalated
between the uniformly grown PANI spines (50–60 nm) over the
RGO surface. The optical band gap of ∼1.9 eV calculated from
the UV–vis spectrum illustrates the extended light absorption
range for the NiO@PANI/RGO photocatalyst. The efficiency of 98% MB
degradation within 11 min with the degradation rate constant 0.086
min–1 for NiO@PANI/RGO has surpassed any other report
on metal oxide/graphene-based ternary composites. Overall, this work
could pave the way for the fabrication of futuristic hierarchical
structured ternary nanocomposites as an efficient photocatalyst and
facilitate their application in the environmental protection issues.

1 Introduction
With
industrialization and population growth, the environmental
contamination caused by organic pollutants has become a pivotal issue
all over the world. Also, effluents from various industries, particularly
dyes, are the major source causing damage to living organisms.1−4 They, being nonbiodegradable, can eventually decrease the dissolved
oxygen capacity of water, thereby disturbing the natural ecological
balance.5 Therefore, the management of
these nonaffable wastes is the need of hour toward a clean and healthy
environment.

Earlier, an assortment of efforts has been conceded
to surmount
these environmental issues. Among them, photocatalysis has attracted
considerable attention for degrading organic pollutants in wastewater
treatments by exploiting the energy from natural sunlight or artificial
illumination.6,7 Recently, synthesis of polymer-based
photocatalysts has been extensively studied by the scientists owing
to their extensive applications in multidisciplinary areas.8,9 Among them, polyaniline (PANI) has been investigated comprehensively
because of its unique conjugation mechanism, engaging benzenoid and
quinoid rings escorting to three different oxidation states.10 Moreover, PANI has been proved as a potential
candidate in commercial applications owing to its large absorption
coefficient in a visible region, easy protonation reversibility, excellent
redox properties, and good environmental stability.11,12 Also, it can efficiently sensitize organic dyes because of its superior
light and thermal stability ensuring the recycling of the photocatalyst.13 In order to recycle effectively, another aspect
which should be taken care of is the mechanical stability of the photocatalyst.
This can be achieved by offering a stable matrix, adding further to
enhance the robustness of the resulting composite.

Graphene
has emerged as a promising alternative because of its
high surface area, zero band gap, and its ability to accept the electrons
to prevent the recombination of photogenerated charge-carrying moieties.14 Furthermore, it not only provides a two-dimensional
(2D) plane for catalyst deposition but also enhances the adsorption
capacity of the dye via π–π conjugation between
the dye and aromatic regions of graphene.15−17 Furthermore,
PANI acts as an electron donor and a hole conductor, whereas graphene
acts as an electron acceptor on photoexcitation with visible or UV
light.18,19 Hence, their hybrid with inorganic materials
or precisely transition-metal oxides additionally enhances the degradation
rate owing to the synergistic effects by reducing recombination losses.20,21 Different transition-metal oxides such as TiO2, ZnO,
MnO2, nickel oxide (NiO), and Cu2O have been
investigated toward their photocatalytic activities.22−24 Recently, researchers have shown an increasing interest toward the
fabrication of a reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-based ternary composite,
which can uniquely bring a synergistic effect. Miao et al. synthesized
an RGO/PANI/Cu2O hydrogel showing Congo red degradation
in 20 min, signifying an improved performance of the composite.20 Further, in situ polymerization of aniline with
graphene and ZnFe2O4 results in a catalyst with
augmented degradation efficiency for rhodamine B.21 The composite of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)
with graphene and MnO2 by Zhang et al. also showed its
catalytic activity by degrading methylene blue (MB) after 7 h.1 Kumar et al. synthesized the PANI@TiO2/GN photocatalyst for MB degradation within 180 min.25 Variation in mechanical support by utilizing graphitic
carbon nitride is also explored by Pendiselvi et al. for MB degradation,
which took 80 min.26 In addition, gold
nanoparticles are also investigated in the ternary composite constituting
graphene and TiO2 for MB degradation, which demonstrates
a complete MB degradation after 250 min.27 Although significant milestones have been achieved, fabricating
a hierarchically engineered ternary nanocomposite by optimizing material
arrangement and taking advantage of their synergistic functions28−30 with an outstanding activity remains a challenge. Furthermore, most
of these photocatalysts are associated with drawbacks related to the
low photoresponse of TiO2 toward visible light, high cost
of Ag or Au, which act as a prime element in the composites, and long
degradation time.31 Nevertheless, NiO nanopowder,
an inexpensive, nontoxic, p-type semiconductor, with a wide band gap
(3.2–3.8 eV) possessing unique electrochemical, catalytic,
and magnetic properties with high hole mobility,32 which can be synthesized in diverse morphologies using
a facile synthetic method, has not found deserving attention.33

Following the above discussion, we have
synthesized the hierarchical
architecture of NiO (10 nm) nanoparticles adsorbed on the PANI nanospines
(50–60 nm) uniformly grown on 2D RGO nanosheets (NiO@PANI/RGO)
via a facile interfacial method, followed by a microemulsion solvothermal
process. The as-prepared nanocomposite is evaluated using various
microscopic and spectroscopic techniques to determine its physical
and chemical properties. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity
along with the kinetics of degradation of MB illustrates the ultrafast
catalytic activity with an enhanced cycling performance of the NiO@PANI/RGO
composite.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation
of a Hierarchical Nanocomposite
The synthesis of the hierarchical
nanocomposite NiO@PANI/RGO is
schematically shown in Scheme 1. First, the PANI/GO composite was prepared by interfacial
polymerization. GO prepared by modified Hummer’s method along
with oxidant ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS) was suspended in (0.1
M HCl) aqueous solution, while the monomer aniline dissolved in n-hexane formed the organic phase. The aniline monomer at
the liquid/liquid interface (water/n-hexane) slowly
diffuses from the organic phase to the aqueous phase where the oxygen
functional groups on the GO surface act as the nucleation sites for
polymerizing aniline to form uniform PANI nanospines. The presence
of acidic aqueous medium facilitates the growth of a homogeneous composite
exhibiting an intercalated PANI and GO structure instead of an individually
grown agglomerated form.34 PANI/GO so formed
acted as the matrix for the growth of NiO nanospheres on its surface
by a microemulsion solvothermal method. In the microemulsion process,
sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT)/isooctane, the nonpolar phase, forms reverse
micelles having nanosized aqueous pools stabilized by the surfactant.
These individual aqueous pools of PANI/GO, nickel chloride, and sodium
hydroxide were mixed sequentially to make their micellar solutions
and precipitated further under the solvothermal condition to give
a hierarchical ternary composite (NiO@PANI/RGO).

Hierarchically Structured Ternary Composite NiO@PANI/RGO
for MB Degradation
2.2 Morphology and Structure
The surface
morphologies of the RGO, PANI, PANI/RGO, and NiO@PANI/RGO composites
were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 1a,b shows the SEM images of the as-prepared RGO exhibiting
a typical crumpled and wrinkled multilayered sheet structure with
the size in tens of micrometers. PANI prepared by the interfacial
method shows a globular cluster morphology (few micrometers) with
uniformly grown 20–30 nm sized spines on its surface (Figure 1c,d). The morphology
of PANI/RGO shown in Figure 1e,f is not much different from that of bare PANI, that is,
the graphene surfaces are homogeneously covered with interconnected
networks of PANI spines giving much higher loadings of PANI in the
composite. However, an increase in the size of PANI spine to 50–60
nm is observed for PANI/RGO. This may be due to the presence of oxygen-containing
functional groups on the GO surface, which act as the nucleation and
growth sites for the PANI spines on the graphene matrix. These functional
groups not only act as active sites but also minimize the interfacial
energy barrier at the solid surface and bulk solution interface, resulting
in an advantageous growth of the PANI spines.29,35−37 The morphology of PANI/RGO is retained even after
the formation of the NiO nanoparticles (Figure 1g,h). Because of the fine nature of NiO nanoparticles,
they are either adsorbed on the exposed surfaces of PANI/RGO or intercalated
between them. These NiO nanoparticles can be clearly seen from the
TEM micrographs of NiO@PANI/RGO (Figure 2). The TEM image of RGO (inset, Figure 2a) demonstrates the
exfoliated individual sheet structure, whereas bare PANI and PANI/RGO
micrographs are dominated by the spines of PANI (Figure 2a,b,d,e, respectively). The
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of bare PANI and
PANI/RGO (Figure 2c,f)
disclose that these materials lack the crystalline character. In contrast,
the NiO@PANI/RGO micrographs shown in Figure 2g,h illustrate the homogeneously distributed
NiO nanoparticles on the PANI/RGO surface. The spotty SAED pattern
(Figure 2i) also demonstrates
the nanocrystalline features of NiO. The average particle size, calculated
from particle size distribution histogram, is found to be 10 nm for
NiO. For further study, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrographs
and 2D fast Fourier transform (2D FFT) images are taken (Figure 3) from the yellow
colored circular portions in Figure 2h. Three distinctive sets of lattice fringes, which
correspond to the 200, 111, and 220 planes having the d-spacing 0.2, 0.24, and 0.14 nm of NiO, are identified using HRTEM
(Figure 3a–d),
which also shows the correlation with 2D FFT calculations shown by Figure 3e.38,39 Further, a higher Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area
of NiO@PANI/RGO is achieved as compared to that of PANI and PANI/RGO
(Figure S1) and found to be 90 m2/g.

and NiO@PANI/RGO, respectively. The inset in (a) shows the micrograph
of RGO.

Figure 3 HRTEM micrographs (a–d) and the 2D FFT
pattern (e) of NiO@PANI/RGO.

The powder X-ray diffractogram of NiO@PANI/RGO can be indexed
to
the NiO bunsenite structure (space group = Fm3m (225),
JCPDS card #047-1049). As shown in Figure 4a, the characteristic X-ray diffraction (XRD)
peaks located at 2θ: 38.3, 44.5, and 66.2 correspond to the
111, 200, and 220 planes of NiO.40 Absence
of any other NiO phases confirms the high purity of the synthesized
composite, NiO@PANI/RGO. The average crystallite size as calculated
by the Scherrer formula is found to be ∼7.0 nm,41 which shows close resemblance to the particle
size as observed by the HRTEM micrograph. Moreover, the XRD pattern
also gives additional information regarding the presence of PANI and
reduction of GO in the composite. Bare PANI demonstrates broad peaks,
centered at 2θ = 15, 20.12, and 25.26°, and the same are
also observed for binary and ternary composites as well. The XRD pattern
of PANI/RGO reveals the characteristic reflection peaks for both PANI
(at 2θ = 15, 20.12, and 25.26°) and RGO (at 2θ =
24.6, and 42.5°), indicating the successful polymerization of
PANI on graphene. Furthermore, the NiO@PANI/RGO diffractogram exhibits
the reflection peaks of PANI along with NiO. The peak at 2θ
= 24.6° corresponding to the interlayer spacing of the graphene
sheets overlaps with the broad diffraction of PANI, resulting in a
broad peak around the 2θ value of ∼25°.34 The interaction of PANI and graphene is further
ascertained by the Raman shift of the G peak in PANI/RGO and ternary
composite as compared to RGO (Figure S2).

NiO@PANI/RGO; the core XPS spectra of C 1s (c), O 1s (d), N 1s (e),
and Ni 2p (f) of NiO@PANI/RGO.

The surface composition and chemical states of the synthesized
materials are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
and the results are presented in Figure 4b–f. Figure 4b shows the survey spectra of PANI, PANI/RGO,
and NiO@PANI/RGO. The presence of different elements C 1s, O 1s, N
1s, and Ni 2p is indexed in the figure. The core spectra of C 1s,
O 1s, N 1s, and Ni 2p are deconvoluted using a Gaussian fitting method. Figure 4c displays the deconvoluted
C 1s spectrum of NiO@PANI/RGO, revealing the presence of three different
types of carbon functional groups, that is, nonoxygenated carbon (C–C/C=C/C–H)
at 284.6 eV, oxygenated carbon (C–O/C=O/O–C=O)
in the range 288 eV, and nitrogenated carbon (C–N/C=N)
near 286.8 eV.6 The comparative O 1s spectrum
shows two peaks at 529.2 and 531.2 eV because of the Ni–O bond
in NiO along with a peak at 533.5 eV (Figure 4d) attributed to the physisorbed and chemisorbed
water and a number of surface species including hydroxyls, chemisorbed
oxygen, and coordinated lattice oxygen for NiO@PANI/RGO.42,43 The PANI/RGO O 1s core spectrum possesses peaks corresponding to
only oxygen functionalities and chemisorbed or physisorbed water (Figure S3). The core N 1s spectrum of NiO@PANI/RGO
(Figure 4e) illustrates
three peaks corresponding to three different electronic states of
nitrogen: the quinoid amine at 398.2 eV, the benzenoid amine at 399.4
eV, and the diminished nitrogen cationic radical (N+•) at 401 eV.34 These observations indicate
that PANI is in protonated state in the ternary composite and in all
other synthesized samples under discussion. Figure 4f shows the Ni 2p3/2 spectrum
centered around 854.5 eV with a shake-up peak at the high binding
energy side of Ni 2p3/2, signifying the formation of NiO.
Such a shake-up peak in the Ni XPS spectrum of NiO@PANI/RGO is attributed
to arise from multiplet coupling and monopole charge-transfer transition
(O 2p → Ni 3d).44

The variation
in optical absorbance is examined using UV–vis
spectroscopy (Figure S4). As compared to
PANI and PANI/RGO, NiO@PANI/RGO shows optical absorption in the entire
visible region, ascertaining that it could be utilized as efficient
light absorbers with augmented photocatalytic properties. The optical
band gap of PANI as calculated by the Tauc plot (Figure S4) is found to be 2.6 eV, whereas the in situ introduction
of graphene in PANI decreases the band gap by 0.3 eV for PANI/RGO.
Furthermore, in the case of the ternary composite, the band gap decreased
to 1.9 eV, which ascertains our proposal of making ternary nanocomposites
for effective sunlight utilization.

Such uniformly distributed
NiO nanoparticles over PANI spines grown
on the RGO surface in the hierarchical mode with an optimum band gap
are expected to show strong synergistic interactions, resulting in
an enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ternary composite NiO@PANI/RGO.

2.3 Photocatalytic Evaluation
The graphene
nanocomposite-based photocatalysis is widely employed as a potential
approach for decomposing environmental hazardous materials owing to
their wide spectral range of irradiation. MB, a chemically stable
dye, is considered as an organic pollutant45 and used to investigate the photocatalytic performance of NiO@PANI/RGO
by scrutinizing its degradation in an aqueous solution. Blank tests
performed in the presence of light and NaBH4 show insignificant
degradation even after 60 min of treatment as can be observed from Figure 5a. This indicates
that MB degradation is negligible without adding the photocatalyst
(inset, Figure 5a),
revealing the importance of the catalyst for an effective mineralization
of the dye molecules. Besides, the experimental result confirms that
the MB aqueous solution is highly stable and dormant under visible
light.

Figure 5 (a) UV–vis spectra of MB degradation (10–5 M) in dark and in the presence of sunlight and NaBH4;
the inset shows the degradation of MB after 100 min in the three cases.
(b,c) UV–vis spectra of MB degradation in the presence of NiO@PANI/RGO
with and without NaBH4, respectively. The inset shows their
respective C/C0 vs time
plots. (d) Comparative degradation efficiency of ternary (NiO@PANI/RGO),
binary (PANI/RGO), bare PANI, and RGO and (e) digital image of MB
degradation in the presence of the NiO@PANI/RGO photocatalyst (0 min
→ 4 min → 8 min → 11 min).

Figure 5b,c
shows
a variation in the UV–vis spectra during MB degradation in
the presence of the NiO@PANI/RGO catalyst with and without NaBH4, respectively. The characteristic absorbance of MB at 664
nm7 decreases rapidly as the time prolonged
and the solution eventually turned colorless [leuco MB (LMB)], as
shown by temporal evolution of the MB degradation process in Figure 5e. The time taken
by the ternary composite in degrading MB (∼65%) in the absence
of NaBH4 is very less as compared to the degradation (∼98%)
in the presence of NaBH4. This can be attributed to the
relay effect of the ternary composite in which the nanoparticles act
as an electron relay and commence the shifting of electron from BH4– [donor (B2H4/BH4–)] to MB [acceptor (LMB/MB)] and thus result
in the reduction of the dye (Figure S5).
The in situ BH4– formed get simultaneously
adsorbed on the surface of the ternary composite and thus electron
transfer occurs from BH4– to MB through
the NiO@PANI/RGO composite, making the dye colorless after reduction.46−48 The active species during the degradation process is also analyzed
by scavenging experiments7 and shown in Figure S6. It is clearly noted from the figure
that degradation is affected by the addition of different scavengers
in the presence of NiO@PANI/RGO + NaBH4. However, in the
degradation process with different scavengers, the degree of MB degradation
decreases to 78, 75, and 37% with the addition of ammonium oxalate,
isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and methanol (MeOH) (Figure S6), implying that O2–• is the dominating active radical in the MB decomposition process
in the presence of NiO@PANI/RGO + NaBH4, thereby resulting
in an ultrafast sunlight-driven degradation of MB.

In order
to compare the performance, NiO@PANI/RGO, PANI/RGO, bare
PANI, and RGO are explored as photocatalysts under similar experimental
conditions. It is interesting to note that MB degradation in the presence
of NiO@PANI/RGO takes ∼11 min for almost complete degradation
(∼98%), whereas PANI/RGO, PANI, and RGO take an extended time
duration to degrade 97, 84, and 32% of MB, respectively, revealing
the ultrafast degradation by NiO@PANI/RGO (Figure 5d). The difference in the photocatalytic
rates may attribute to the interaction of MB molecules with PANI,
NiO, and RGO, affecting their adsorption on the composite surface.
Improved adsorption takes place on the hierarchically fabricated ternary
composite owing to its enhanced active surface sites with an augmented
interface charge-transfer efficiency, which is further analyzed by
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In the EIS Nyquist plot,
the radius of the arc in the high-frequency region (inset) (charge-transfer
resistance, RCT as in Figure S7b) reflects the reaction rate occurring on the surface
of the electrode.17 PANI shows an RCT of 3.1 Ω, which decreases to 0.8 Ω
by introducing RGO in PANI, enhancing the effective separation of
photogenerated carriers. Compared with PANI and PANI/RGO, the ternary
composite (NiO@PANI/RGO) possesses the lowest value of RCT, 0.3 Ω, indicating an augmented separation efficiency
of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and faster interfacial
charge-transfer rates in accordance with the displayed results of
MB degradation.

In order to determine the specific amount of
the dye concentration,
experiments were carried out by varying different concentrations of
the MB dye (10–4 and 10–3 M) (Figure 6a,b) by using 8 mg
of the catalyst (NiO@PANI/RGO). Their insets demonstrate the time
course of C/C0. Further,
in order to evaluate the kinetic mechanism of degradation of MB using
the NiO@PANI/RGO (NaBH4) photocatalyst, the degradation
results are examined according to first-order kinetics (Figure 6c):  where C0 is the
initial concentration of MB solution, Ct is the concentration of the MB solution after treatment
at time t, and k1 is
first-order rate constant.49

Figure 6 UV–vis
spectra for MB degradation (a) 10–4 M and (b) 10–3 M in the presence of 8 mg NiO@PANI/RGO
photocatalyst. The inset shows their respective C/C0 vs time plots, (c) plot of ln(C/C0) vs time to analyze the
kinetics; UV–vis spectra for MB degradation in the presence
of NiO@PANI/RGO (d) 6 mg and (e) 4 mg. The inset shows their respective C/C0 vs time plots and (f) plot
of ln(C/C0) vs time to
analyze the kinetics with different concentrations of the photocatalyst.

The degradation of MB follows
a first-order kinetic model as shown
by its regression coefficient (R2 >
0.99).
As the concentration of MB changes from 10–5 to
10–3 M, the reaction rate constant (k) decreases, that is, 0.086, 0.015, and 0.006 min–1, respectively. With an increasing concentration, the decrement in
the rate constant may be attributed to the excess of MB molecules
getting adsorbed on the catalyst surface.

Furthermore, the photocatalyst
concentration is varied (4–8
mg in 30 mL of MB solution; 10–5 M), and the result
toward the MB degradation process is further explored (Figure 6d,e for 6 and 4 mg photocatalyst,
respectively). It is observed that the decolorization efficiency is
highest with 8 mg photocatalyst with the rate constant of 0.086 min–1 (Figure 6f), which can be attributed to higher available active sites
of the photocatalyst. However, a further increment in the photocatalyst
amount (10 mg) decreases the degradation rate (not shown here). This
may attribute to the aggregation of the nanocomposite, resulting in
decreased active sites at a higher concentration. Hence, the photocatalyst
amount was kept as 8 mg (else specified) in the subsequent analysis
for obtaining maximum degradation efficiency.

The recyclability
of the photocatalyst (NiO@PANI/RGO) is further
analyzed by its repeated use toward the catalytic activity. Ten rounds
of degradation reaction for MB (10–5 M) are accomplished
with the recycling of the catalyst under the same reaction condition
(Figure 7). After the
completion of the first cycle, the photocatalyst was washed with double-distilled
water and dried prior to the next use. The results in 3D representation
(Figure 7a) demonstrated
that NiO@PANI/RGO maintained a consistent activity even after 10 runs
of the catalyst. The slight demur of the degradation degree (Figure 7b) may be attributed
to the loss of the catalyst during the recovery process. In addition,
the good reliability and stability of the NiO@PANI/RGO catalyst are
also confirmed by the XRD measurements of the catalyst, before and
after the degradation cycles (Figure 7c). As compared to the fresh catalyst, no significant
change in the XRD patterns is observed, suggesting an excellent stability
of the photocatalyst (NiO@PANI/RGO) during MB degradation.

NiO@PANI/RGO, (b) variation in the degradation efficiency of the ternary
catalyst during 10 degradation cycles, and (c) XRD profile of NiO@PANI/RGO,
before and after the degradation cycle.

The photocatalytic performance of NiO@PANI/RGO in comparison
with
that of the other recently reported ternary composites is presented
in Table 1. It is observed
from the table that the hierarchically structured NiO@PANI/RGO photocatalyst
is much superior compared to the previously reported catalysts for
sunlight-driven MB degradation. Furthermore, the hierarchical NiO@PANI/RGO
photocatalyst presented in this work requires a very short degradation
time with a significantly small amount bestowing a persuasive sunlight-driven
photocatalyst for MB removal.

3 Conclusions
To summarize, the hierarchical structured ternary composite (NiO@PANI/RGO)
with a higher adsorption ability has been synthesized by interfacial
polymerization, followed by a microemulsion solvothermal process.
The morphology characterization results ascertain the formation of
the NiO nanoparticles (10 nm) over the PANI spines (50–60 nm)
grown uniformly over the 2D graphene sheets. The NiO@PANI/RGO composite
formed acts as an efficient photocatalyst for MB dye degradation under
sunlight irradiation. The NiO@PANI/RGO photocatalyst can rapidly degrade
98% of the MB aqueous solution (10–5 M) in 11 min
following the first-order reaction at a rate constant of 0.086 min–1. This enhanced photocatalytic activity is ascribed
to the synergistic effect of an increased lifetime of photoexcited
charge carriers in the hierarchical nanocomposite. In addition to
this, increasing the concentration of the photocatalyst has a significant
effect on the rate constant of MB degradation because of the increasing
availability of adsorption and photocatalytic centers. Moreover, the
NiO@PANI/RGO composite is found to perform a rapid MB degradation
compared to PANI/RGO and bare PANI. Furthermore, the photocatalyst
preserves an ultrafast and repetitive degradation efficiency up to
5 MB degradation cycles and maintains an 89% efficiency even after
10 degradation cycles. Thus, the development of such hierarchical
metal oxide/polymer/graphene composites by the facile synthesis method
represents a very stable, recyclable, and economical approach for
the degradation of highly dangerous MB dyes in the wastewater.

sulfate (Na2SO4), and hydrochloric acid (HCl)
were of GR grade and were used as received from Merck. AOT was used
as the surfactant (supplied by Alfa Aesar).

The as-prepared
samples were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope
(JEOL, JXA-8230) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV, a high-resolution
transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 12 Twin TEM operating
at 120 kV), the powder XRD measurements (an X’Pert Pro MPD
X-ray diffractometer) employing monochromatized Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.54056 Å) at 298 K, an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer
(PHI 5000 Versa Prob II, FEI Inc), and Raman spectroscopy on a Renishaw
inVia Raman microscope equipped with a laser having a wavelength of
514 nm. The EIS analysis in a frequency range 1 mHz to 1 MHz was performed
by CHI760 in a three-electrode assembly in 0.5 M Na2SO4. Platinum and Ag/AgCl were assembled as the counter and reference
electrodes, respectively. Polished graphite (1 cm2) coated
with a synthesized material served as the working electrode. Further,
a degradation study was performed using a UV–vis spectrometer
(PE LAMBDA 650/850/950).

4.2 Preparation of PANI
PANI was prepared
by a typical procedure via in situ chemical oxidative interfacial
polymerization.34 Briefly, aniline (0.5
M) was dissolved in 20 mL of precooled n-hexane solvent
under vigorous stirring at room temperature. Separately, APS (2 M)
(keeping the molar ratio of aniline/APS as 1:4) was dissolved in 20
mL of precooled 1 M HCl solution. Subsequently, the aniline monomer
solution was added very slowly to the APS solution to form an immiscible
liquid/liquid interface. The mixed solution was at a constant temperature
0–4 °C, and the polymerization was allowed to proceed
at the interface for 12 h without stirring. Polymerization started
within few minutes, which can be identified by the formation of green
colored PANI (emeraldine salt) at the n-hexane/water
interface. The polymerized product was separated by filtration using
a cellulose nitrate membrane (0.45 μm) and washed with methanol
to remove the oligomeric products. After washing with a copious amount
of deionized water, the sample was dried in vacuum for 12 h.

4.3 Preparation of the PANI/GO Composite
GO was synthesized
from graphite powder by modified Hummer’s
method.50 The in situ chemical oxidative
interfacial polymerization method was used for the synthesis of the
PANI/GO composite following the similar procedure as that adopted
for PANI synthesis with the exception that GO (the weight ratio of
aniline to GO is 80:20) was also added along with APS in 1 M HCl aqueous
solution and sonicated to form a homogeneous suspension. Thereafter,
a precooled aniline monomer dissolved in n-hexane
(molar ratio of aniline/APS 1:4) was slowly added into the above solution
and kept constant for 12 h maintaining the temperature at 0–4
°C. The resulting product was filtered using a cellulose nitrate
membrane (0.45 μm) and washed with methanol and deionized water.
Finally, the powdery composite PANI/GO was dried at 60 °C for
12 h in vacuum and used for synthesizing a ternary composite with
NiO.

4.4 Preparation of the NiO, PANI, and RGO Ternary
Composite (NiO@PANI/RGO)
The NiO@PANI/RGO composite was synthesized
using the microemulsion method. At first, the microemulsion solutions
were prepared by taking AOT in isooctane, which acts as the organic
phase. Nickel chloride (NiCl2) and precipitating agent
(NaOH) dissolved in water acted as the aqueous phase. Typically, 6
g AOT was dissolved in 60 mL of isooctane and divided into three parts
of 20 mL each.51−53 Afterward, 20 mL aqueous solutions of 0.5 M NiCl2, 2 M NaOH, and 20 wt % PANI/GO were added to the AOT/isooctane
solutions, respectively. Each of these microemulsions was stirred
for 2 h. The resulting solutions were mixed together in a reaction
vessel, transferred to an autoclave, and kept at 180 °C for 12
h, followed by natural cooling. The as-obtained black precipitate
was filtered and washed with deionized water, followed by drying at
60 °C in vacuum.54 Also, graphene
oxide in the composite was reduced to graphene during the in situ
growth of NiO.51 The resulting powder was
dispersed in 10 mL of 0.1 M HCl solution and stirred at room temperature
overnight to obtain NiO@PANI/RGO. The final composite was filtered,
washed, and dried at 60 °C in vacuum. The dried NiO@PANI/RGO
powder was used for characterization and photocatalytic activity.
The ratio of wt % of individual components RGO/PANI/NiO in the ternary
composite (NiO@PANI/RGO) is 4:16:80, as calculated by the reactants
taken in the initial synthesis stage. For comparison, PANI/RGO was
also prepared following the similar reduction process.

4.5 Photocatalytic Experiment
The photocatalytic
activity of the prepared samples was determined based on the sunlight-driven
degradation of MB. In a typical experiment, the photocatalyst (8 mg)
was mixed with the MB solution (10–5 M), which was
further stirred in dark for 30 min to reach the adsorption equilibrium
prior to the photocatalytic test. Then, fresh aqueous NaBH4 (0.01 M) was mixed in the above solution, followed by irradiation
with solar light. These experiments were conducted in October between
11 am and 12 pm. After a particular interval, 2 mL aliquot was sampled
and the change in MB concentration was estimated by a UV–vis
spectrophotometer. The experiments were done in triplicate to achieve
reliable results. The photocatalytic activities of the samples were
evaluated by measuring the decolorization efficiency (%) of the MB
solution.

The reproducibility of the photocatalytic degradation
activity on the NiO@PANI/RGO nanocomposite was studied at a constant
MB concentration (10–5 M) and a catalyst dosage
of 8 mg in 30 mL dye solution in each cycle. The recovered catalyst
was washed with ethanol and deionized water, followed by drying before
its reuse in the next photocatalytic cycle.

The degree of degradation
(%) is calculated by using the relation54  where C0 and Ct are the initial and remaining
concentrations of MB at different times, respectively. C0/C can be substituted by A0/A for the reason that the concentration
(C) is directly proportional to the absorbance (A) as  where k is a constant and A is the absorption intensity.55
