This paper describes the authors’
preliminary studies directed
toward the possibility of the practical implementation of the idea
to design efficient antitumor drugs based on hybrid molecules composed
of fullerene C60 and quadricyclanes. The essence of the
proposed idea is that these hybrid molecules are able to cleave DNA
owing to the fullerene moiety they contain and to simultaneously thermally
affect tumor cells via cleavage of the carbon–carbon bond in
quadricyclanes under the action of Pd and Pt ions. As a result, testing
of the cytotoxic activity in vitro for a number of fullerene C60 hybrids with the norbornadiene or quadricyclane moieties
against the human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Jurkat cells) in
combination of the known cisplatin drug, which was taken as the source
of Pt ions, showed a statistically reliable dose-dependent increase
in the number of dead cells in each group, which were formed according
to the amount of cisplatin added, in comparison with the control,
that is, cells treated with cisplatin or quadricyclane fullerene derivatives
alone. Indeed, the difference between the percentages of viable cells
after treatment with either cisplatin alone or cisplatin in combination
with methanofullerene 5 ranged from ∼10% (for
Pt (0.015 mkM), 5 (0.015 mkM)) to ∼55% (for Pt
(0.03 mkM), 5 (0.045 mkM)).

Introduction
The unique properties
of fullerenes and their derivatives have
been attracting close attention of researchers in relation to the
development of efficient antioxidants,1 solar energy converters,2 artificial
diamonds,3,4 materials for electronic,5 semiconductor equipment,6 engine
oil additives,7 and advanced pharmaceutical
agents.8 Of particular interest and practical
value are biologically active fullerene derivatives with potential
for the development of new-generation drugs needed for the treatment
of socially significant diseases.

The biological activity of
fullerenes stems is attributed to number
of their properties such as lipophilicity (responsible for membranotropic
behavior), electron deficiency (determines the reactivity toward free
radicals), and the ability of fullerenes in the excited state to transfer
energy to a dioxygen molecule, which is thus converted to singlet
oxygen.9 Research into the antitumor activity
of fullerenes occupies a special place in the whole range of their
possible applications.

Testing in mice has demonstrated the
ability of fullerene C60 to suppress the growth of various
histological types of
tumors.10,11 In 2010, Jiao and co-workers12 found that poly hydroxyfullerene C60(OH)x activates the peritoneal macrophages
and inhibits the tumor growth in the EMT-6 metastatic breast cancer
model. In turn, the quaternary ammonium salt of simple pyrrolidinofullerene
exhibited high cytotoxicity toward promyelocyte leukemia cells.13,14 More comprehensive descriptions of antitumor activity assays for
fullerenes and their derivatives were reported by Bolskar and Orlova
and co-workers.15,16 Particular attention of researchers
is on the use of fullerenes for the targeted delivery of various substances17 and enhancement, in this way, of the antitumor
properties18−20 of well-known drugs. The use of fullerenes as targeted
drug delivery vehicles is a relatively new; however, it is a vigorously
developing trend in fullerene chemistry and applications, which requires
both new ideas and long-term systematic research.

Recently,21 we have synthesized cyclopropane
fullerene C60 derivatives containing norbornadiene and
quadricyclane moieties. It was found that in the presence of a catalytic
amount of cisplatin, quadricyclane-containing methanofullerenes are
quantitatively isomerized to the corresponding norbornadienes with
heat generation. In view of the discovered carbon–carbon bond
cleavage in the quadricyclane moiety of the hybrid molecule in the
presence of catalytic amount of Pt ions with the generation of about
110 kJ/mol22 of heat, we proposed the idea
that new hybrid molecules would be accumulated more efficiently in
tumor cells than in normal cells because of more intense tumor cell
metabolism. On subsequent introduction of cisplatin in a substantially
lower amount than used in medicine, the hybrid molecules will be cleaved
and hence exert simultaneously both chemotherapeutic and thermal effects
on cancer cells, which will induce, as we hope, efficient cell death.

Results
and Discussion
To test our hypothesis, here we report the
synthesis of the hybrid
molecule comprising fullerene C60 and quadricyclane by
the Bingel–Hirsch reaction. In view of the high hydrophobicity
of fullerenes and fullerene derivatives and low stability of the quadricyclane
moieties located in the close vicinity to the fullerene core,21 malonic acid ester 3 was synthesized
as the precursor of the α-halo carbanion. Scheme 1 depicts the total synthetic route to the
hybrid molecule, which includes the subsequent introduction of hydrophilic
monoacylatedtriethylene glycol to norbornadiene malonic acid monoester 1(21) by the carbodiimide method
and UV irradiation of the norbornadiene malonic ester 2 to give quadricyclane ester 3. In the final stage,
nucleophilic addition of α-halo carbanions generated in situ
by the reaction of quadricyclane ester 3 with CBr4 in the presence of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)
resulted in the synthesis of the target hybrid molecule 5 in ∼68% yield. To identify the effect of the quadricyclane
moiety on the antitumor activity of hybrid molecule 5, methanofullerene 4 with the norbornadiene addend was
synthesized as the reference compound.

Scheme 1 Total Synthetic Route
to Methanofullerenes 6 and 7 Containing
Norbornadiene and Quadricyclane Moieties
The structures and compositions of methanofullerenes 4 and 5 were reliably established using modern physicochemical
techniques (nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), UV, and matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI TOF)/TOF mass spectrometry).

The 13C NMR spectrum of methanofullerene 4 shows 14 nonequivalent signals corresponding to the type of symmetry
of the fullerene molecule, which has two local planes of symmetry,
one coinciding with the cyclopropane ring plane and the other passing
orthogonal to this plane through the common bridging carbon atom.
The norbornadiene moiety is manifested as characteristic 1H NMR doublets at 2.04 and 2.07 ppm for the geminal protons that
are linked, according to the HMBC experiment, to the bridging carbon
atom with δC of 70.55 ppm, and as multiplets with
δH 6.92 and 7.01 ppm for the double-bond hydrogen
atoms of the polycycle. The 1H NMR spectrum of methanofullerene 5, unlike that of norbornadiene isomer 4, exhibits
a set of high-field signals at about 1.5–2.7 ppm, corresponding
to the cage hydrogen atoms, which is in full agreement with the published
data for the quadricyclane adducts.23

In the next stage of our research, we have investigated the in
vitro antitumor activity of the norbornadiene and quadricyclane derivatives
of fullerene C604 and 5 on the
human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Jurkat cells).

According
to the published data,20 fullerene
C60 enhances the cytotoxicity of cisplatin against the
HL-60/adr and HL-60/vinc tumor cells, including cisplatin-resistant
sublines; therefore, we initially studied the cytotoxicity of an aqueous
solution of the poly vinylpyrrolidone complex of fullerene C60 used in combination with a cisplatin solution in dimethylformamide
and the effects of methanofullerenes 4 and 5 with quadricyclane and norbornadiene substituents on Jurkat cells.

Treatment of the cells with aqueous solutions of the poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
complex or methanofullerene 5 in different concentrations
(0.015, 0.03, and 0.045 mkM) does not affect significantly the cell
viability even after 72 h (Figure S11).

Simultaneously, it was shown that the combined addition of cisplatin
and a solution of C60 does not induce a significant change
in the Jurkat cell viability as compared with the cells treated with
cisplatin alone (Figure S12).

Having
obtained the above control parameters of the cytotoxic effect
of the initial compounds and cisplatin on the viability of Jurkat
cells, in the next stage, we made efforts to experimentally verify
the hypothesis, put forward previously, about the utilization of the
exothermic conversion of quadricyclane to norborna-2,5-diene under
the action of catalytic amounts of platinum compounds for the potential
use in the therapy of cancer.

Initially, the Jurkat cells were
treated simultaneously with solutions
of methanofullerene 5 and cisplatin (Pt) in various concentrations
(5, 0, 0.015, 0.03, and 0.045 mkM; Pt, 0, 0.015, 0.03,
0.06 mkM); after incubation for 24 h, the cells were stained with
7-aminoactinomycin D (AAD), and the ratio of dead and viable cells
was determined by flow cytometry and is depicted as a histogram in Figure S13. The results indicated the absence
of any effect of the joint treatment of tumor cells with cisplatin
and methanofullerene 5. The percentages of viable cells
in each group of cisplatin concentrations (0.015, 0.03, and 0.06 mkM)
at various concentrations of compound 5 (0, 0.015, 0.03,
0.045 mkM) differed by 2–5%, which is within the experimental
error.

Considering the high rate of quadricyclane ring opening
induced
by platinum and palladium compounds,24,25 we assumed
that in the case of simultaneous addition of cisplatin and methanofullerene 5, the catalytic conversion of quadricyclane to norbornadiene
occurred outside the cell, which accounts for the failure. Therefore,
in the subsequent studies, we first incubated the cells with cycloadduct 5 in various concentrations for 24 h, then a cisplatin solution
(0.015, 0.03, or 0.06 mkM) was added, and this was followed by one
more incubation for 24 h. After the treatment of the flow cytometry
results, as shown below in Figure 1, a reliable dose-dependent increase in the number
of dead cells was detected in each group (formed according to the
amount of cisplatin added) in comparison with the control, that is,
the cells treated with cisplatin alone (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Joint effect of concentrations of methanofullerene 4 (on top) or 5 (below) and cisplatin added after
24
h on the viability of Jurkat cells (the histogram shows the percentage
of viable cells).

Indeed, the difference
between the percentages of viable cells
after treatment with either cisplatin alone or cisplatin in combination
with methanofullerene 5 ranged from ∼10% (for
Pt (0.015 mkM), 5 (0.015 mkM)) to ∼55% (for Pt
(0.03 mkM), 5 (0.045 mkM)). It is known that quadricyclanes
(without fullerene C60) kill ∼64% of Jurkat cancer
cells at a concentration of 0.3 mkM used.26

It is noteworthy that conducting this experiment with methanofullerene 4 containing a norbornadiene moiety did not reveal a significant
increase in the percentage of dead cells in comparison with the control.

We have also tested our hypothesis on normal fibroblasts (Figure 2). When compound 5 was added separately with the subsequent addition of cisplatin
after 24 h of incubation, the changes in the culture of normal fibroblasts
were similar to those of Jurkat cells treated and incubated in a similar
manner. Meanwhile, statistical data processing showed a reliable increase
in the number of viable cells in the fibroblast culture at similar
concentrations of compound 5 and cisplatin as compared
to the Jurkat cells (the concentration of compound 5 was
0.015, 0.03, and 0.045 mkM, respectively) (p ≤
0.005).

Figure 2 Joint effect of concentrations of 5 and cisplatin
added after 24 h on the viability of normal fibroblasts (the histogram
shows the percentage of viable cells).

The hypothesis about the cell thermal necrosis due to the heat
released during the intracellular isomerization of the quadricyclane
fragment of the fullerene derivative 5 under the action
of cisplatin is also confirmed by the results of the investigations
into the induction of apoptosis using flow cytometry (Figure S14).

Thus, to study the induction
of apoptosis, before starting the
flow cytometry experiment, the chosen cell line was treated by fluorescent
dyes (annexin V and propidium iodide (PI)). This allowed to select
four different cell populations, as a percentage, when registering
the process of apoptosis: living cells (Q7-3, annexin
V–/PI−), early cell apoptosis (Q7-4, annexin
V+/PI−), late apoptosis (Q7-2, annexin V+/PI+)
and necrosis (Q7-1, annexin V–/PI+). As shown
in Figure 3, treatment
of Jurkat cells with quadricyclane 5 (0.045 mkM) followed
by incubation for 24 h has practically no effect on the cell population
as compared to the control in Figure 3A. When cells were treated with cisplatin (0.06 mkM)
and exposure time was 24 h, only a population of living cells (32%),
as well as cells in early (12%) and late (56%) apoptosis, were observed
(Figure 3C). In turn,
a cytometric picture underwent significant changes, when adding cisplatin
(0.015 mkM) to cells preincubated for 24 h with quadricyclane 5 (0.045 mkM), with exposure time of 2 h. The cytometry data
have shown populations of only living and necrotic cells (Figure 3D). This is in good
agreement with our idea of cell thermal necrosis as a result of the
intracellular isomerization of the quadricyclane fragment of fullerene
derivative 5 under the action of cisplatin due to the
heat release.

with
quadricyclan and/or cisplatin stained with annexin V/PI (A, control;

cisplatin for 24 h; and D, cells treated with quadricyclan, followed
by addition of cisplatin after 24 h).

Conclusions
We have synthesized hybrid molecules based on fullerene C60 and norbornadiene or quadricyclane using the Bingel–Hirsch
reaction. In a study of the cytotoxic effect of hybrid molecules together
with cisplatin on the T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Jurkat cells),
we have demonstrated for the first time that the water-soluble poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
complex of methanofullerene containing the quadricyclane addend induces
a statistically reliable increase in the number of dead cells in each
group, formed according to the amount of cisplatin added, in comparison
with the control.

Experimental Section
General Information
All reactions were performed under
an argon atmosphere and in anhydrous solvent. The solvents and reagents
were dried or refined according to the literature procedures. Commercially
available [60]fullerene (99.5% pure, Sigma-Aldrich) and cisplatin
(ABCR) were used. The reaction products were analyzed on a high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatograph Shimadzu SPD-20A (Japan)
equipped with the UV detector at 313 or 340 nm. The mixtures were
separated on a preparative column Cosmosil Buckyprep Waters (250 ×
10 mm2) at ∼20 °C. Toluene was used as eluent,
and the flow rate was 3.0 mL/min. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-500 spectrometer at
500.17 and 125.78 MHz, respectively. A mixture of CDCl3 and CS2 (1:5) was used as a solvent. The chemical shifts
are reported as δ values in parts per million relative to the
internal standard Me4Si. The coupling constants (J) are reported in Hertz. The mass spectra were obtained
on an UltraFlex III TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany) operating
in linear (TOF) and reflection (TOF/TOF) positive and negative ion
modes. S8 and DCTB (trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenyliden]malononitrile)
were used as the matrix. For the application on a metal target, toluene
solutions of the samples were used. Hamamatsu Lightning cure LC-8

Biological Assays
Cell Culturing
Jurkat cells were
purchased from Russian
Cell Culture Collection (Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy
of Sciences) and cultured according to standard mammalian tissue culture
protocols and sterile technique. All cell lines used in the study
were tested and shown to be free of mycoplasma and viral contamination.
Jurkat cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)
1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 4 mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, Sigma), and 100 units/mL penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma).
Cells were grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
The cells were subcultured at 2–3 days intervals. The cells
were then seeded in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells
per well and incubated overnight. Jurkat cells were subcultured at
2 day intervals with a seeding density of 1 × 105 cells
per 24-well plates in RPMI with 10% FBS.

Cytotoxicity Assay
Viability (live/dead) assessment
was performed by staining cells with 7-AAD (7-aminoactinomycin D)
(Biolegend). Cells after treatment with compounds at various concentrations
and incubated in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C
during 24 h (cisplatin added simultaneously) or 24 + 24 h (cisplatin
added after 24 h) were harvested, washed 1–2 times with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and centrifuged at 400g for 5 min.
Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 mkL of flow cytometry staining
buffer (PBS without Ca2+and Mg2+, 2.5% FBS)
and stained with 5 mkL of 7-AAD staining solution for 15 min at room
temperature in the dark. Samples were acquired on NovoCyteTM 2000
FlowCytometry System (ACEA) equipped with 488 nm argon laser. Detection
of 7-AAD emission was collected through a 675/30 nm filter in FL4
channel.
