The applied pyrolysis temperature
was found to strongly affect
composition, structure, and oxidation behavior of pure and iron oxide
nanoparticle (NP)-loaded carbon materials originating from hydrothermal
carbonization (HTC) of cellulose. A strong loss of functional groups
during pyrolysis at temperatures beyond 300 °C of the HTC-derived
hydrochars was observed, resulting in an increase of the carbon content
up to 95 wt% for the carbon materials pyrolyzed at 800 °C and
an increase of the specific surface area with a maximum of 520 m2 g–1 at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C.
Devolatilization mainly took place in the range from 300 to 500 °C,
releasing light pyrolysis gases such as CO, CO2, H2O and larger oxygen-containing molecules up to C11. The presence of iron oxide NPs lowered the specific surface areas
by about 200 m2 g–1 and resulted in the
formation of mesopores. For the iron oxide-containing composites pyrolyzed
up to 500 °C, the oxidation temperature was decreased by about
100 °C, indicating tight contact between the iron oxide NPs and
the carbon matrix. For higher pyrolysis temperatures, this catalytic
effect of iron oxide on carbon oxidation vanished due to carbothermal
reduction to iron and iron carbide, which, however, catalyzed the
graphitization of the carbon matrix. Thus, the well-controlled two-step
synthesis based on a biomass-derived precursor yielded stably embedded
iron NPs in a corrosion-resistant graphitic carbon matrix.

1 Introduction
Porous
graphitic carbon materials are used in a variety of applications,
for example, in gas separation and water purification, as electrodes
in electrochemical devices, and as supports for heterogeneous catalysts.
For the latter, they offer numerous advantageous properties, such
as high electronic and thermal conductivity, strong resistance against
chemical corrosion, and a high accessible surface area.1−4 In heterogeneous catalysis, porous graphitic carbon materials may
be a viable cost-reduced alternative to carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which
are used in applications such as electrocatalytic water splitting
or as a support for the Fischer–Tropsch catalysts.5−9 Recently, especially biomass-derived carbon materials have received
much attention because of the possible conversion of a waste product
stream into a valuable product.1,10−13 Often, this conversion proceeds via ill-defined one-step pyrolysis
of the carbon-rich precursor.1−4,11 One alternative is
the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of the precursor in subcritical
water before pyrolysis. Compared with dry pyrolysis, this well-controlled
two-step process is considered suitable for upscaling and retains
approximately three times more carbon in the product because of lower
evolution of CO and CO2.14,15 Also, HTC
is advantageous over dry pyrolysis of biomass because most of these
feedstocks are quite humid and an initial drying step can be omitted.16 Compared with the synthesis of CNTs, the preparation
of HTC-derived carbon supports does not involve a growth catalyst,
thus avoiding impurities and an additional cleaning procedure. Furthermore,
in situ doping during the HTC dispenses with postsynthetic functionalization
and impregnation as required for metal deposition on CNTs.6,17,18

Still, the product obtained
by HTC, the so-called hydrochar, needs
drying and, depending on the targeted application, a subsequent pyrolysis
step. The exact pyrolysis conditions such as gas-phase composition,
final temperature, and heating rate affect not only the amount and
chemical nature of the released volatiles but also the morphology,
structure, and composition of the resulting material.19,20 Before pyrolysis, the surface of the hydrochar is rich with oxygen-containing
functional groups that can be used for further nitrogen functionalization
or directly act as anchor sites for catalytically active nanoparticles
(NPs).6,21,22 During pyrolysis,
a part of these groups decomposes, the carbon matrix starts to graphitize,
and a network of pores forms. It is necessary to control all these
effects in order to create a suitable support material for catalysis.

Hence, in this study, we investigate the influence of HTC and subsequent
pyrolysis on the composition, structure, and chemical stability of
the resulting porous carbon matrix. Furthermore, we evaluate adding
iron oxide NPs to the precursor to further control HTC and pyrolysis
and, thus, the properties of the final composite material. As starting
material for the carbon support, we used cellulose as a pure, cheap,
and nonfood biomass-derived material. The use of iron oxide NPs is
promising because iron can catalyze both carbonization and graphitization
in different chemical states and may then act as the actual catalyst
in the desired application, such as the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.6,17,18

2 Results
2.1 Pyrolysis
2.1.1 Temperature-Programmed
Pyrolysis
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments
were performed
to evaluate devolatilization as a function of pyrolysis conditions. Figure 1 depicts the relative
mass loss of the pure and iron-oxide-loaded hydrochars during heating
to 800 °C in He in the thermobalance.

Figure 1 Relative mass loss and
DTG curves (a,c) and the corresponding QMS
profiles (b,d) of the pure (a,b) and iron oxide-loaded hydrochar (c,d)
during TPD measurements in He, applying a heating rate of 5 K min–1.

The total volatile fraction
amounts to 50 and 56 wt % for the pure
and the iron oxide-loaded hydrochar, respectively. The main release
of volatiles occurs in the temperature range from 250 to 700 °C
with the desorption maxima at about 310, 430, and 650 °C. The
released volatile compounds are mostly H2 (m/z = 2), H2O (m/z = 18), and CO (m/z =
28), as identified by the online mass spectrometer (Figure 1). At low temperatures, the
release of H2O takes place predominantly, whereas the mass
loss in the intermediate temperature range is due to the release of
H2O and CO. At high temperatures, H2 evolution
is dominant. Iron oxide loading of the hydrochar results in a pronounced
mass loss at around 300 °C because of the release of H2O and at around 650 °C, which coincides with the strong evolution
of CO. Furthermore, a pronounced evolution of H2 at temperatures
above 550 °C is present for the iron-doped sample compared with
the undoped hydrochar. H2 can originate from dehydrogenation
because of an increasing degree of graphitization and the elimination
of hydrogen bound to aliphatic carbon atoms, which may be catalyzed
by the present iron species.23

To
quantify the differences in devolatilization because of the
presence of iron oxide, sequential desorption experiments were performed
in the thermobalance. Table 1 shows the relative mass loss per temperature step of both
hydrochars.

Step (100 °C) of the Pure and Iron Oxide-Loaded Hydrochar during
Sequential TPD Measurements in He in a Thermobalance

Both hydrochars exhibit the
same qualitative behavior with respect
to the main mass losses at pyrolysis temperatures between 300 and
500 °C. For pyrolysis temperatures higher than 400 °C, the
mass loss per temperature step gradually decreases, independent of
the presence of iron oxide. The onset of devolatilization is more
pronounced for the iron-containing samples, and the mass loss between
300 and 500 °C is 15% higher compared with the pure sample.

2.1.2 Flash Pyrolysis
The pyrolysis–gas
chromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry (MS) setup provides additional
qualitative information on evolving aromatic molecules and tars by
chromatographic analysis. Figure 2 displays the chromatograms of the stepwise pyrolysis
of the pure and iron oxide-loaded hydrochars in the most interesting
region between 300 and 500 °C.

Figure 2 Chromatograms of the evolved species of
the pure (left) and iron
oxide-loaded carbon materials (right) as a function of the pyrolysis
temperature during sequential flash pyrolysis in the pyrolysis–GC/MS
setup.

In each step of the sequential
flash pyrolysis, permanent gases,
such as CO, CO2, and H2O, and light hydrocarbons
elute with retention times less than 5 min as confirmed by thermogravimetric
(TG)/MS analysis. At a pyrolysis temperature of 300 °C,
first aromatic products appear (retention times: 6–23 min).
Also, hydrocarbons (retention times: 23–33 min) are present
for both hydrochars. The molecules released from the pure sample are
almost entirely oxygen-functionalized, mostly monocyclic, and of a
size up to C11. No large polycyclic aromatics or long-chain
hydrocarbons are observed.

The product distribution of the pyrolysis
at 400 °C is much
broader and contains substituted, unsaturated and saturated, frequently
heterocyclic 5-membered rings such as furan derivates and corresponding
bicyclic compounds containing an additional aromatic ring. Increasing
the temperature to 500 °C changes the product distribution significantly,
as the fraction of substituted monocyclic and bicyclic aromatics increases.

For the corresponding iron oxide-loaded samples, the spectrum of
evolved products differs. During pyrolysis at 300 °C, the presence
of iron oxide leads to a more pronounced release of oxygen-functionalized
unsaturated 5-membered rings and acyclic hydrocarbons. For pyrolysis
at 400 °C, the product distribution contains much more different
species compared with the pure sample, such as several substituted
furan and furanone molecules as well as cyclopentane and cyclopentene
derivates, mono- and bicyclic aromatic components, and acyclic O-functionalized
hydrocarbons.

Beyond 600 °C, no further evolution of larger
organic products
was observed from either of the carbon materials (Figure S3). Yet, the intensity of the signal for permanent
gases at low retention times remains high even for higher pyrolysis
temperatures up to 800 °C, which corresponds to the ongoing release
of small molecules, such as H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and H2O.

2.1.3 Pyrolysis
Duration
Figure 3 shows the temperature-programmed
oxidation (TPO) of the pure porous carbon materials, which had been
pyrolyzed at 800 °C for different durations. The hydrochar exhibits
two differential thermogravimetry (DTG) maxima due to devolatilization
at about 320 °C and total oxidation at 500 °C. In comparison,
the carbon materials originating from pyrolysis exhibit only one mass
loss step due to oxidation. Pyrolysis for 1 min at 800 °C under
the applied conditions already leads to complete elimination of the
low-temperature mass loss due to devolatilization.

(left) and DTG curves (right) of the pure
carbon materials obtained by pyrolysis at 800 °C with different
durations during TPO in 20% O2 in He in a thermobalance
applying a heating rate of 5 K min–1.

The oxidation temperature of the pyrolysis product
gradually increases
as a function of the pyrolysis time from about 520 °C for 1 min
to 570 °C for 10 min and 590 °C for 120 min.

a The amount of oxygen is derived
from the amounts of C, H, and Fe (if present) and contains organic
as well as inorganic oxygen for the iron oxide-loaded samples.

b The amount of oxygen (wt %) was
calculated according to O = 100 – C – H – Fe.
Up to 500 °C, Fe was assumed to prevail in the state of Fe2O3. Above 500 °C, the dominant iron species
was taken as Fe3C as indicated by XRD.

c A systematic error of 0.3 in the
stoichiometry coefficient of C cannot be excluded.

Clearly, the applied pyrolysis temperature
strongly affects the
elemental composition. The carbon content of the pure carbon materials
increases with higher pyrolysis temperature from the initial 65 to
95 wt % at 800 °C accompanied by decreasing hydrogen and oxygen
amounts.

The highest relative increase in carbon content is
observed in
the temperature range between 300 and 500 °C. Obviously, the
presence of iron oxide has no strong effect on the elemental composition.
Although the release of volatiles was about 10% higher for the iron
oxide-loaded materials than for the pure ones, the loss of carbon
via CO in the iron oxide-loaded sample results in approximately the
same composition. During pyrolysis, the molar oxide-free composition
changes from (C2.8H2.2O)n and (C2.5H2.4O)n for the pure and iron oxide-loaded hydrochars, respectively,
and to (C31.7H3.6O)n and (C26.1H2.1O)n for pyrolysis at 800 °C.

For the iron oxide-loaded hydrochar,
the actual iron loading amounts
to 1.9 wt %, which is equivalent to 2.7 wt % Fe2O3. Accordingly, half of the amount of iron oxide added to the cellulose
suspension before HTC was incorporated into the hydrochar, whereas
the other half was lost during washing. The relative iron content
of the material increases with higher pyrolysis temperature because
of the higher degree of devolatilization resulting in 3.8 wt % Fe
for FeHTC-800.

The van Krevelen diagram (Figure 4) illustrates the carbonization process,
revealing
a large decrease of the O/C and H/C ratios with increasing pyrolysis
temperature.

Figure 4 van Krevelen diagrams of the pure (left) and iron oxide-loaded
carbon materials (right) after pyrolysis at different temperatures.

The organic oxygen content was
calculated from the amounts of C,
H, and the content of the present iron species. Accordingly, up to
a pyrolysis temperature of about 500–600 °C, the elemental
composition formally corresponds to dehydration. Beyond this temperature,
a more pronounced dehydrogenation occurs with a higher slope independent
of the presence of iron oxide.

2.2.2 X-ray
Diffraction
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the pure carbon materials do not reveal the presence
of a crystalline phase for any of the applied pyrolysis temperatures
(Figure 5). In the
presence of iron oxide, the prevailing iron phase depends on the pyrolysis
temperature. For pyrolysis up to 300 °C, the XRD patterns indicate
the presence of hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite
(Fe3O4). Pyrolysis at 400 and 500 °C leads
to the reduction of hematite to magnetite. For pyrolysis temperatures
higher than 500 °C, the iron oxides undergo carbothermal reduction
to metallic iron and iron carbide (cementite, Fe3C). Furthermore,
a pronounced reflection at 26° 2θ indicates emerging crystalline
graphitic carbon. For the iron-doped samples pyrolyzed at 700 and
800 °C, Bragg’s law was applied to this reflection to
calculate the interlayer distance yielding 3.4 Å, which is in
good agreement with the (002) plane of pure graphite.  

Figure 5 XRD patterns of the pure
(left) and iron oxide-loaded (right) carbon
materials pyrolyzed at temperatures in the range from 200 to 800 °C.

2.2.3 Specific
Surface Areas
The influence
of pyrolysis temperature on the specific surface areas is illustrated
in Figure 6. The as-synthesized
pure hydrochar has a specific surface area of 5 m2 g–1, which slightly increases when applying the pyrolysis
temperatures of 200 and 300 °C. Higher temperatures lead to a
large increase of the specific surface area reaching a maximum of
520 m2 g–1 for a pyrolysis temperature
of 600 °C. Beyond 600 °C, a slight decrease is observed.
For the iron oxide-loaded hydrochar, a similar trend of the surface
areas as a function of pyrolysis temperature is obtained. Yet, the
actual surface areas for a given pyrolysis temperature are lower by
about 200 m2 g–1.

Figure 6 Specific surface areas
as a function of the pyrolysis temperature
for the pure and iron oxide-loaded carbon materials.

The recorded isotherms for the pure and iron oxide-loaded
porous
carbon materials after pyrolysis at 500 and 800 °C are shown
in Figure 7, revealing
that these carbon materials are porous. There is strong adsorption
at low relative pressures with a higher amount of adsorbed N2 for the pure carbon material suggesting the presence of micropores.
Evaluation using the t-plot method demonstrates that
for the carbon materials pyrolyzed at 800 °C, the surface area
is about sixfold higher than the external surface area because of
these micropores. Furthermore, the t-plots provide
the micropore volumes of the samples (Figure S2). They amount to 0.188 and 0.141 cm3 g–1 for the pure and iron oxide-loaded carbon materials pyrolyzed at
800 °C, respectively. The decrease of the micropore volume by
about 25% because of doping is assigned to a promoting effect on the
partial gasification of the carbon matrix during pyrolysis. The total
amount of adsorbed N2 is slightly increasing in the medium
relative pressure range for all carbon materials indicating a low
amount of small mesopores. In this range, the increase in N2 adsorption of the iron oxide-loaded samples is similar to the pure
samples. For the pure samples, the strong increase in the adsorption
of N2 at p/p0 higher than 0.7 is likely due to capillary condensation in large
mesopores and macropores. In comparison, for the iron oxide-loaded
samples, there is no increase at high p/p0 indicating the absence of larger pores. Pyrolysis of
the iron oxide-loaded carbon material at 800 °C leads to a marked
hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption isotherms, which
is not observed on applying a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C.
The isotherms reveal that for FeHTC-800, a different porous structure
evolved compared with the pure and iron oxide-loaded samples pyrolyzed
at lower temperatures. The origin of the hysteresis is assigned to
the desorption from cavities in the material arising from the graphitization
process during pyrolysis. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images presented in Figure 11 demonstrate the detachment of graphitic carbon layers from
iron-containing particles causing voids in the nanometer range.

Figure 7 N2 physisorption isotherms of the pure and iron oxide-loaded
porous carbon materials after pyrolysis at 500 °C (left) and
800 °C (right).

2.2.4 NMR Spectroscopy
Figure 8 shows the NMR spectra of the
pure hydrochar and the corresponding carbon material pyrolyzed at
800 °C.

Figure 8 13C NMR spectra of the pure hydrochar and the
resulting
porous carbon material after pyrolysis at 800 °C for 1 h.

Carbon atoms can be classified
by their chemical shifts in 13C NMR spectra into sp3-hybridized carbon atoms
below 100 ppm, sp2-hybridized carbon atoms between 100
and 160 ppm, and carbonyl species (170–225 ppm).24−26 The NMR spectrum of the pure hydrochar reveals the presence of various
carbon species, including a broad distribution of aliphatic carbon
atoms in CH3 and CH2 groups at low chemical
shifts. In the range from 100 to 160 ppm, sp2-hybridized
carbon atoms in carbon double bonds (C=C), aromatic structures,
and chemical bonds to an oxygen atom (C=C–O) are present.
Hydrochar contains oxygen functional groups, such as carbonyl groups
in aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids (175–215 ppm) or
sp3-hybridized carbon atoms bound to an oxygen atom, for
example, in alcohols or ethers (∼75 ppm).24−26 Pyrolysis at
800 °C leads to the removal of aliphatic carbon atoms and O-functional
groups. The broad signal from 120 to 170 ppm corresponds to carbon
in double bonds and aromatic rings.

2.2.5 Attenuated
Total Reflection–IR Spectroscopy
The attenuated total
reflection (ATR)–IR spectra of the
pure carbon materials (Figure 9) contain intensive bands for aromatic C=C stretching
vibrations at about 1600 cm–1,27,28 skeletal C=C vibrations at around 1500 cm–1,14,27,29 and aromatic
out-of-plane vibrations in the range of 900–700 cm–1.30,31

Figure 9 ATR–IR spectra of the pure (a,b) and
iron oxide-loaded carbon
materials (c,d) as a function of the pyrolysis temperature.

C=O stretching vibrations
occur at 1700 cm–1,31,32 which decrease
in intensity with higher
pyrolysis temperature. Also, a broad band in the range from 3600 to
3200 cm–1 is visible, originating from O–H
stretching vibrations.33 Bands between
1470 and 1370 cm–1 are mainly due to different CH
vibration modes,27,29,30 and the ones between 1200 and 1000 cm–1 indicate
the presence of C–O groups.27,30,32

Up to a pyrolysis temperature of 300 °C,
changes in the recorded
spectra are minor. For higher temperatures, the structure changes
significantly indicated by a decrease of the C=C and C=O
bands and an increase of the aromatic out-of-plane bands. In addition,
the aliphatic C–H vibrations corresponding to the band at around
2920 cm–1 disappear with increasing pyrolysis temperature.30,31 Simultaneously, the intensity of the band at 3045 cm–1 assigned to aromatic C–H vibrations31,33 rises.

Overall, the ATR–IR spectra of the pure and
iron oxide-loaded
materials show the same qualitative trends with respect to the applied
pyrolysis temperatures, that is, a decrease of the number of O-functional
groups and aliphatic CHx groups as well
as an increasing degree of aromatization with increasing pyrolysis
temperature. ATR–IR measurements of the material pyrolyzed
at 700 and 800 °C were not conclusive because of the increased
absorbance of the samples and the very low content of functional groups.

2.2.6 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy
elucidates structural changes as a function of the pyrolysis temperature
(Figure 10). Compared
with XRD, Raman measurements monitor structural properties also at
a short-range order.34,35 The normalized Raman spectrum
of the carbon materials exhibits two broad and overlapping peaks at
about 1350 and 1585 cm–1. These bands are typical
for carbonaceous materials and can be assigned to the D and G bands,
respectively.

Figure 10 Raman spectra of the pure (left) and iron oxide-loaded
carbon materials
(right) as a function of the pyrolysis temperature in the range from
200 to 800 °C.

Amorphous and disordered
carbon materials consist of sp2-hybridized and sp3-hybridized carbon atoms. In pure graphite,
only the G band is present at about 1581 cm–1. The
G mode of E2g symmetry is caused by in-plane stretching
of bonds of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms and is therefore
not limited to aromatic rings.36 The D
band at about 1350 cm–1 originates from a vibration
mode with A1g symmetry because of graphene layer edges
in disordered graphitic lattice.34,35 It is caused
by the breathing vibration of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms
in sixfold rings.36

The Raman spectra
were fitted by a Lorentzian (L) function for the
D peak and a Breit–Wigner–Fano (BWF)
curve for the G peak. The BWF function, besides being strongly recommended
for the best fitting of the asymmetrical G peak shape, can also take
residual Raman intensity at about 1450 cm–1 into
account without using an additional peak.36

The pyrolysis of hydrochars in a large temperature range implies
very different Raman spectral features. Therefore, it is necessary
to adopt a consistent fit for all samples: the BWF and L line pair
is a satisfying mode to fit Raman spectra of all carbons from graphite
to amorphous carbons.36 An additional L
line was also used to fit a shoulder on the side of the D peak (named
D4 at about 1230 cm–1) visible on the more amorphous
samples.

Although in graphitic materials only one D line is
observed, polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules show few modes around 1300 cm–1.37 Thus, the substructure
of the D peak and, specifically, the clear appearance of the D4 peak
as a shoulder of the D peak can be attributed to some merging of different
PAH moieties present in the structure.38

The intensity ratio of the D and G bands (I(D)/I(G)) is often used as an indicator of structural
order.
The I(D)/I(G) ratio increases for
graphitic carbon materials with long-range order in graphitic layers
compared with pure graphite, when defects like borders of aromatic
clusters occur. In contrast, for materials composed of few aromatic
clusters of small size, the intensity of the D mode is dominated by
the fraction of sixfold rings in the cluster. Therefore, in the latter
case, an increasing I(D)/I(G) ratio
implies ordering.36

For the pure
hydrochar, the height of the D band at 1350 cm–1 is significantly lower than the height of the G band.
With increasing pyrolysis temperature, the ratio of the D and G bands
gradually increases (Figure 10 and Table 3).

a The calculation of the I(D)/I(G)
ratios for FeHTC-700 and FeHTC-800 was
omitted due to the low intensities of the corresponding Raman spectra.

As the synthesized porous carbon
material is rather amorphous,
this observation reveals ongoing thermal annealing of defects and
therefore the increasing graphitization for carbon materials pyrolyzed
at higher temperatures. For the iron oxide-loaded samples, the analysis
of the spectra is less conclusive as the overall intensity of the
detected Raman spectra is lower compared with the pure materials.
The G band is clearly observable for the samples pyrolyzed up to 600
°C, whereas the peak of the D band is less sharp.

Iron
oxide-loaded samples pyrolyzed at 700 and 800 °C show
no peaks in the range between 1000 and 2000 cm–1, which might be a consequence of the changed scattering properties
because of the structural changes occurring during carbothermal reduction.
However, this could not be resolved with the applied acquisition times
requiring further Raman studies, including optimized detection conditions
also at lower wavenumbers for the iron oxide NPs. The ratios of the
intensities of the D and G bands summarized in Table 3 also show an increase of the I(D)/I(G) ratio with increasing pyrolysis temperatures
up to 600 °C as for the pure carbon materials.

2.2.7 Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM measurements were
performed for additional information on structural
ordering caused by iron oxide loading and thermal treatment.

Figure 11 shows the pure carbon material pyrolyzed at 800 °C
and the iron oxide-loaded samples treated at 500 and 800 °C.
The pure sample pyrolyzed at 800 °C is predominantly amorphous,
but some fringes exist at the shell of the particles. Owing to the
layer distance of about 0.35 nm, these are identified as graphitic
layers. However, the domains of graphitic ordering are scarce, of
low range, and contain only a few layers in a stack. Therefore, a
pyrolysis temperature of 800 °C is not suitable to prepare a
highly graphitic carbon material based on the HTC of pure cellulose.

Figure 11 TEM
images of the pure carbon materials treated at 800 °C
(top) and the iron oxide-loaded composites pyrolyzed at 500 °C
(middle) and 800 °C (bottom).

In Figure 11, the
dark spheres in the TEM images of the iron oxide-loaded composites
represent the incorporated iron particles. The pyrolysis of the iron
oxide-loaded HTC carbon material at 500 °C results in a highly
amorphous carbon material. No evidence of structural ordering, even
on a small scale, can be observed. In contrast, FeHTC-800 contains
both amorphous and ordered fractions. Fringes are present in multilayer
stacks composed of several to 30 layers, whose distance of about 3.5
Å is consistent with the graphite (002) plane. These graphitic
domains are several nm long taking into account the bent shape. Yet,
no strict core–shell type structures are observed. The absence
of graphitic layers around the iron particles and a less ordered shell
might be due to carbon layers becoming detached from the iron carbide
particles during the thermal treatment.39

2.3 Resistance to Oxidation
TPO experiments
were performed to detect the effect of pyrolysis-induced changes in
composition and structure on the oxidation behavior (Figure 12). The oxidation profile of
the pure hydrochar exhibits two mass loss peaks, one at about 320
°C and the other at 500 °C.

Figure 12 DTG curves of the pure
(left) and iron oxide-loaded carbon materials
(right) during TPO in 20% O2 in He in a thermobalance applying
a heating rate of 5 K min–1.

The first mass loss is due to devolatilization, and the second
one originates from the oxidation of the remaining carbon matrix.
For the pure material, pyrolysis in the range of 200–500 °C
leads to a gradual decrease of the intensity of the devolatilization
signal, whereas the carbon oxidation temperature stays constant at
500 °C. For pyrolysis temperatures higher than 500 °C, devolatilization
is no longer observed. The peak maximum temperature of carbon oxidation
continuously increases with increasing pyrolysis temperature from
500 °C up to 585 °C for the sample pyrolyzed at 800 °C.

Loading the hydrochar with iron oxide also results in an oxidation
profile with two mass loss peaks. However, the first DTG peak due
to devolatilization is shifted by about 30 °C to lower temperatures,
and the oxidation temperature is decreased by about 100 °C clearly
revealing the catalytic influence of the Fe2O3 NPs. Up to a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, the trend of
decreased mass loss due to devolatilization without shifting the oxidation
temperature is identical to the pure sample. For pyrolysis temperatures
of 600 °C and higher, the TPO peaks are shifted to higher temperatures
but not as much as TPO peaks of the corresponding pure samples. The
peak temperature for FeHTC-800 is only 10 °C lower than the oxidation
temperature of the corresponding HTC-800 (Table 4).

Analysis of the composition
of the product gas stream during TPO
of the porous carbon materials reveals that during the initial mass
loss of the pure and iron oxide-loaded material, mainly H2O, CO, and CO2 evolve (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The major product of the second mass
loss is CO2. Pyrolysis at 800 °C results in only a
single high-temperature mass loss during TPO, producing CO2 and low amounts of CO and H2O.

3 Discussion
The performed experiments address the effects
of the pyrolysis
temperature and the presence of iron oxide on the elemental composition,
structural properties, and oxidation behavior of the porous carbon
materials prepared by HTC of cellulose and subsequent pyrolysis of
the resulting hydrochars. Several techniques were applied to analyze
structural changes of the material during pyrolysis, which consistently
reveal the decrease of O-functional groups and aliphatic CH groups
as well as an increase of aromaticity when increasing the pyrolysis
temperature. TPD experiments using the pure and iron oxide-loaded
hydrochars show that the main mass loss occurs at pyrolysis temperatures
between 300 and 500 °C, followed by a gradual decrease of devolatilization
at higher pyrolysis temperatures (Figure 1, Table 1). Thus, a significant change in composition occurs
between 300 and 500 °C (Table 2), resulting in an increase of the degree of carbonization
and evolution of volatile components, mainly H2O, H2, CO, CO2, and larger tar-like compounds. The latter
contain aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygen-functionalized
molecules up to C11 (Figure 2). At pyrolysis temperatures beyond 600 °C, the
composition of devolatilization products changes from tars to small
molecules, such as H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and H2O (Figures 2 and S1, Supporting Information), which may originate from the cracking of originally heavier molecules
or from structural ordering and decomposition of functional groups
with higher thermal stability such as lactone, phenol, and carbonyl
groups.40 Initially, the prepared hydrochar
has a carbon content of 65 wt %. Higher pyrolysis temperatures lead
to a further decrease of the hydrogen and oxygen fraction, so that
materials pyrolyzed at 800 °C contain up to 95 wt % carbon.

According to the van Krevelen diagram (Figure 4), changes in elemental composition can be
divided into a low-temperature regime, where the decomposition processes
formally correspond to dehydration, and a more intense dehydrogenation
starting at 600 °C, which is presumably caused by an increasing
degree of aromatization. Obviously, devolatilization occurs on a shorter
time scale than structural rearrangements in the carbon materials.
However, the small differences between pyrolysis duration of 30 and
120 min confirm that the procedure of pyrolyzing the hydrochars for
60 min is adequate.

Although there is no noticeable effect of
iron on the carbonization,
the presence of iron oxide favors the release of H2O, CO,
and H2 during pyrolysis. During pyrolysis, the initially
loaded Fe2O3 NPs are reduced to Fe3O4 at 500 °C, whereas the carbon matrix stays X-ray
amorphous. Beyond this pyrolysis temperature, the iron oxide species
are further reduced to metallic iron and iron carbide indicating carbothermal
reduction    

At higher temperatures, graphitization of the iron-loaded
carbon
materials is observed by XRD. The pure carbon materials hardly contain
any graphitic domains. Long-range order would be required for the
presence of sharp reflections, which were not detected. Clearly, the
generated iron carbide NPs catalyze the graphitization of the amorphous
carbon matrix.17,41,42 Carbon atoms can diffuse into the iron carbide NPs at elevated temperatures,
enabling the growth of graphitic layers around the carbide cores forming
core–shell NPs.41,42 Consistent with the XRD patterns,
TEM images reveal that the presence of iron benefits the graphitization
of the carbon matrix under certain conditions.13 Because of carbidization of iron oxide during the pyrolysis
at higher temperatures, structural ordering and graphitization of
the carbon matrix is enabled.39 No significant
increase in structural order of the carbon matrix occurs during pyrolysis
when iron is present as iron oxide.

Although the specific surface
area of the hydrochars is rather
low, the release of volatiles during pyrolysis causes the formation
of pores resulting in higher specific surface areas. Beyond 600 °C,
a slight decrease is observed which is attributed to the coalescence
or closure of pores.43 For the iron oxide-loaded
composites, a similar trend of the surface areas as a function of
pyrolysis temperature is obtained. Yet, the actual surface areas are
lower. A more pronounced release of H2O as identified by
TPD experiments may lead to carbon gasification catalyzed by iron
resulting in less micropores and a lower specific surface area.44

The release of volatiles during pyrolysis
is known to lead to micropores
in the material.45,46 Large mesopores and macropores,
present in the pure carbon matrix, are due to interstices formed by
clustering of primary particles to aggregates. Compared with the pure
materials, the iron oxide-loaded composites contain small mesopores,
less micropores, but no macropores. Pyrolysis of the iron-loaded composites
at 800 °C results in a different porous structure compared with
pyrolysis at 500 °C and the pure samples. An altered texture
containing ink-bottle shaped pores is presumably due to the graphitization
process as graphitic layers detach from the iron and iron carbide
particles causing interstices. A similar hysteresis for iron- and
iron carbide-containing carbon materials has been reported in the
literature.17

The increase in oxidation
temperature of the carbon materials pyrolyzed
at higher temperatures is attributed to a higher degree of aromatization
and a lower content of reactive functional groups. Loading the hydrochar
with iron oxide NPs significantly decreases the temperature of devolatilization
and oxidation by about 100 °C. Thus, iron oxide has a catalytic
influence on both devolatilization and oxidation for the composites
pyrolyzed up to 500 °C. The iron oxide-loaded composites pyrolyzed
above 600 °C show a much lower decrease in the oxidation temperature.
The XRD results for those pyrolysis temperatures show clearly that
the initially present iron oxide NPs in the hydrochar had been carbothermally
reduced to iron carbide NPs covered by graphitic shells as indicated
by TEM. In this state, iron is no longer catalytically active for
oxidation but instead for graphitization of the surrounding carbon
matrix.

Further studies
are in progress
using the porous carbon samples and the iron NP/graphitic carbon composites
obtained by pyrolysis at 800 °C as the support and catalyst in
the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, respectively. The concept of
loading biomass-derived precursors with catalytically active NP before
HTC and subsequent pyrolysis is quite versatile. It can be adapted
to produce Ni-based catalysts for methanation, Co-based catalysts
for the synthesis of higher alcohols, or to NiFe- and CoFe-based electrocatalysts
applicable in the oxygen evolution reaction.

4 Conclusions
Porous carbon is a potentially suitable material as catalyst support
in a variety of applications. Pure and iron oxide-loaded porous carbon
materials were synthesized by pyrolysis of hydrochars originating
from HTC of cellulose. The main release of volatiles was found to
occur between 300 and 500 °C. The tars produced during flash
pyrolysis were aliphatic and aromatic, oxygen-functionalized, and
of small size (≤C11). Devolatilization was accompanied
by an increasing carbon content and structural changes of the material
because of the decomposition of aliphatic and oxygen-containing functional
groups. For pyrolysis temperatures beyond 500 °C, an increasing
degree of structural ordering and graphitization was observed.

The addition of iron oxide to cellulose did not have a significant
influence on the carbonization of the material during HTC or the subsequent
pyrolysis at lower temperatures, but it changed the spectrum of released
volatiles. More importantly, it affected the morphology and structure
of the resulting porous carbon matrix. The addition of iron oxide
NPs lowered the specific surface area of the composites by up to 200
m2 g–1 and led to the formation of mesopores.
Furthermore, Fe2O3 catalyzed the oxidation of
the carbon matrix, thus lowering the oxidation temperatures significantly
by up to 100 °C.

However, pyrolysis temperatures above
600 °C led to carbothermal
reduction of iron oxide to metallic iron and iron carbide (Fe3C). These species were catalytically inactive for oxidation
but catalyzed the graphitization of the carbon matrix leading to a
more corrosion-resistant composite. Thus, by adding iron oxide NP
before HTC, a very close contact with the carbon matrix was achieved
resulting in iron or iron carbide NPs strongly embedded in a graphitic
carbon matrix.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Synthesis of HTC-Derived Hydrochars
Pure hydrochar
was synthesized by subjecting a mixture of 60 g α-cellulose
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 300 mL deionized water to 200 °C and approximately
16 bar for 24 h in a polytetrafluoroethylene inset of a 500 mL stainless
steel autoclave.14 Similarly, a hydrochar
containing 5 wt % iron oxide was prepared by adding 1.5 g of nanoscale
Fe2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 20–40 nm) to the cellulose
dispersion. This iron oxide precursor also contained a minor fraction
of Fe3O4 as determined by XRD. After HTC, the
obtained suspensions were filtered and washed with deionized water
until a neutral pH was reached. The resulting solids were dried for
24 h at 105 °C in an oven with hot air ventilation.

5.2 Pyrolysis of HTC-Derived Hydrochars
Pyrolysis of the
synthetic hydrochars was investigated using different
conditions and heating rates. Temperature-programmed experiments in
inert atmosphere were performed in a thermobalance applying a heating
rate of 5 K min–1 to investigate mass loss and evolved
gases. Furthermore, sequential desorption experiments in a thermobalance
were carried out by stepwise increase of the treatment temperature.
Stepwise flash pyrolysis was investigated using a pyrolysis–GC/MS
setup, in which the heating rate was several orders of magnitude higher
than in the thermobalance. This setup enabled us to study the evolution
of larger aromatic molecules and hydrocarbons.

5.2.1 Temperature-Programmed
Pyrolysis
TG analysis was carried out in a magnetic suspension
balance (Rubotherm)
with an online mass spectrometer (ThermoStar, Pfeiffer) using about
30 mg sample. Mass loss during pyrolysis was monitored by TPD experiments
in the thermobalance by heating at 5 K min–1 to
800 °C in 100 mL min–1 He (purity 99.999%).
The amount of volatiles released as a function of pyrolysis temperature
was determined by stepwise experiments in the thermobalance applying
a sequential temperature increase in steps of 100 °C (heating
rate 10 K min–1) in He. The corresponding mass loss
was recorded each time after 60 min at the corresponding temperature.

5.2.2 Flash Pyrolysis
Pyrolysis gases
were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a high-temperature
pyrolysis injector and an online mass spectrometer as the detector
(pyrolysis–GC/MS). The setup consists of a multishot pyrolyzer
(EGA/PY-3030D, Frontier Lab) and a GC/MS system (GCMS-QP2010 Ultra,
Shimadzu). The pyrolyzer was heated by a ceramic heater, and the evolving
gases were flushed with He (purity: 99.999%) as the carrier gas to
the GC separation column for subsequent online analysis. As separation
column, the Ultra ALLOY capillary column (UA+-5, 30 m length, 0.25
mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness, Frontier Lab) with 5% diphenyl
95% dimethyl polysiloxane as the stationary phase was used.

The analyzer of the mass spectrometer is a quadrupole mass filter
with a mass range of m/z = 1.5–1090
and a mass resolution (full width at half-maximum) of 0.5–2.0
unified atomic mass unit. The instrument detection limit is ≤10
fg for the standard substance octafluoronaphthalene. The injector
was set to a temperature of 200 °C and a split ratio of 1:20
leading to a column flow of 1.42 mL min–1. The temperature
of the GC oven was programmed to be constant for 5 min at 40 °C
with subsequent heating to 300 °C with a linear temperature rate
of 10 K min–1. The final temperature was kept constant
for 10 min. Ionization in the quadrupole mass spectrometer was accomplished
at 70 eV in the electron impact mode. The mass-to-charge ratio was
detected in the range of 10–500.

For the measurement,
approximately 0.5 mg of the sample was placed
in a sample cup, which fell freely into the oven preheated to temperatures
between 100 and 800 °C in 100 °C steps resulting in a heating
rate in the order of magnitude of 103 K s–1. After the first measurement at 100 °C, the sample was lifted
in the closed system above the oven, the oven temperature was set
100 °C higher and after reaching this temperature, the cooled-down
sample fell freely again into the oven to monitor the next temperature
step.

5.2.3 Variation of Pyrolysis Temperature
Subsequent pyrolysis of the pure and iron oxide-loaded hydrochars
took place in a horizontal oven using flowing N2 (70 mL
min–1, purity 99.999%). Approximately 1 g of the
hydrochar was placed in a quartz boat and pyrolyzed at different temperatures
in the range of 200–800 °C (steps of 100 °C) applying
a heating rate of 5 K min–1 and holding the final
pyrolysis temperature for 60 min.

5.2.4 Variation
of Pyrolysis Duration
Additionally, carbon materials were
prepared with different pyrolysis
durations in the same setup as before and preheated to 800 °C
by varying the residence time from 1 to 5, 10, 30, and 120 min.

The resulting material is labeled as HTC for the pure and FeHTC for
the iron oxide-loaded composites followed by the pyrolysis temperature
in degree Celsius or the duration of pyrolysis in minutes. The hydrochars
are labeled (Fe)HTC-0.

5.3 Characterization
Subsequent to pyrolysis
at different temperatures, the obtained carbon materials were extensively
characterized with respect to structure and reactivity. The composition
of the synthesized samples was determined by elemental analysis (C,
H) applying a EURO EA 3000 elemental analyzer (HEKAtech) and a Vario
EL (Elementar Hanau). Atomic absorption spectroscopy was performed
in a flame spectrometer (SpectrAA 220, Varian) to determine the actual
iron content (wt % Fe) in the sample. Iron-containing phases present
in the composites were identified by XRD in the range from 5°
to 80° 2θ employing a PANalytical MPD diffractometer. The
specific surface area of the samples was determined by a BELSORP-max
(BEL Japan) performing N2 physisorption measurements at
77 K. The obtained isotherms were evaluated according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
method. TEM images were derived by a Cs-corrected transmission electron
microscope (JEOL 2200FS) with a point resolution of 0.19 nm (200 kV).
The samples were suspended in ethanol, and the dispersion was treated
in an ultrasonic bath. A copper grid with a holey carbon film was
applied as the sample holder. Analysis of the obtained TEM images
was done using the software DigitalMicrograph (GATAN). ATR–IR
spectra were recorded in the range from 4000 to 500 cm–1 to investigate the functional groups applying a Nicolet 6700 FTIR
(Thermo Scientific) spectrometer with a diamond ATR accessory DuraSamplIR
II (Smiths Detection) with a resolution of 2 cm–1 and performing 100 scans. 13C magic angle spinning solid-state
(MAS) NMR experiments were conducted using a DPX ∼300 MHz (7
T) spectrometer (Bruker) with a MAS spinning rate of 14 kHz. To enhance
carbon sensitivity, proton-to-carbon cross polarization was carried
out. 20 000 scans per sample were performed, and calibration
of the 13C chemical shifts was achieved by adamantane (δ
= 38.48 ppm). Raman measurements were carried out by employing a confocal
Raman microscope (alpha300 R/A/S) from WITec equipped with a frequency-doubled
Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 532 nm. The laser beam with an intensity
of about 10 mW was directed into the microscope through a single-mode
optical fiber and then focused on the sample surface with a magnifying
objective (magnification = 20, numerical aperture NA = 0.4). The scattered
light was detected by a spectrometer unit (UHTS300) consisting of
a diffraction grating (600 grooves per mm) and a back-illuminated
electron multiplying charge-coupled device (1600 × 200 pixels,
cooled to −60 °C) after collection with the same objective.
The spectra were recorded in the spectral range of 0–3700 cm–1. For every sample, 50 spectra were collected with
an integration time of 1 s for each spectrum and averaged automatically
by the software. All experiments were performed at ambient temperature
and pressure. Glass slides were used as sample holders for all Raman
measurements. The recorded spectra were baseline-corrected and fitted
according to the G and D bands. Finally, the oxidation behavior was
investigated in TPO experiments in a magnetic suspension balance (Rubotherm)
applying a heating rate of 5 K min–1 to 800 °C
in 20% O2 (purity 99.995%) diluted in He (purity 99.999%).
