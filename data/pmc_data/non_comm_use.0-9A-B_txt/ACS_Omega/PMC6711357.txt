Alteration of macrophage polarization
from inflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype can have
striking implications for the regeneration of injured tissues, treatment
of inflammatory diseases, and relief of autoimmune disorders. Although
certain cytokines like interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are capable of
inducing M2 macrophage polarization, their therapeutic potential in
vivo is suffering from low
efficacy due to their instability and poor access to target cells.
Here, we report the synthesis of IL-4-loaded hyaluronic acid (HA)
particle for the targeted delivery of cytokines through the high affinity
of HA to CD44 receptors of macrophages. HA carriers composed of low,
middle, and high molecular weight (MW) polymers were synthesized using
divinyl sulfone (DVS) cross-linking. The MW of HA had a negligible
effect on the physicochemical properties and biocompatibility of the
macrophages, but as an indicative of M2 polarization, a significant
change in the arginase-1 (Arg-1) activity, TNF-α release, and
IL-10 secretion was observed for the HA particles prepared with high
MW polymers. Therefore, these particles were loaded with IL-4 for
simultaneous macrophage targeting and M1 to M2 reprogramming, evidenced
by a remarkable increase in the Arg-1 to iNOS ratio, as well as CD163
and CD206 upregulation in the M1 macrophages, which were initially
triggered by lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ.

1 Introduction
Autoimmune
disorders (ADs) are categorized as chronic diseases derived from an
imbalance between stimulatory and regulatory mechanisms of the immune
system, strongly affected by the genetic predisposition and environmental
condition.1−4 The trigger of immune pathways and systemic inflammatory responses
in AD may result in the damage of healthy tissues by over-reacted
immune cells. Many of the proposed immunoregulatory approaches against
ADs are developed based on the blockage of the interaction between
antigen-presenting cells and T cells.5−8 Owing to the antigenic complexity of ADs
and the need to simultaneously target multiple autoreactive T-cell
specificities, traditional antigen-specific approaches have been shifting
toward new investigation for more advanced and effective therapy of
ADs through the restoration of homeostasis in the immune function
and tissue repair by macrophage reprogramming into immunoregulatory
phenotypes.9−11

Macrophages are present in almost all the organs
of adult mammals and contribute significantly to balanced immunity
and tissue homeostasis, recognized as a key capability to treat autoimmune
diseases through their polarization switching from activated inflammatory
M1 phenotype to M2 tissue regenerating macrophages. The polarization
of macrophages can be stimulated by different noninflammatory biomolecules,
such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and IL-13.12−15 M1 macrophages are mostly overexpressed
in ADs, and their suppression through these cytokines can reduce the
inflammatory reactions within the body. For example, there has been
intensive research on the therapeutic effects of IL-4 on various inflammatory
disease models. Nevertheless, there are big challenges associated
with the rapid degradation and diminished bioactivity of unprotected
IL-4 in the blood circulation, as well as poor targeting to the cells
of interest.16,17 Therefore, an efficient delivery
system is required to protect and specifically target anti-inflammatory
cytokines (e.g., IL-4) to the effector cells with the aim of blocking
pathogenic inflammation without impairing immunity against infections
and tumors, resulting in the expansion of their clinical applications.

Kim et al. suggested that extralarge pores mesoporous silica nanoparticles
(XL-MSNs) possess high clinical potential for modulating immune systems
through high loading and delivery of IL-4 as an M2-polarizing cytokine
in vitro and in vivo. IL-4-loaded XL-MSNs significantly induced polarization
of M2 macrophage in comparison to soluble IL-4.10,18 However, it is presumable that by specific targeting of the IL-4
to the macrophages, better M2 polarization responses can be observed.
For this purpose, CD44 targeting polymers, such as hyaluronic acid
(HA), can be applied since the macrophages are recognized for the
high expression of this protein on their surface.19−22

HA is an anionic biologically
active linear polymer with a variety of molecular weights (MWs). It
is biocompatible, can be found in the extracellular matrix, and is
responsible for important biological functions, including cell interactions
and movements, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, etc.23,24 HA has emerged as an ideal and versatile drug delivery vehicle due
to its water solubility, biodegradability, nontoxic nature, facile
chemical functionalization, and capability to be used as carriers
for different payloads.25−27 Confirmed by previous studies,28 the MW-dependent effect of HA on macrophage
polarization is attributed to the induction of different stimulatory
or suppressive signaling pathways after HA interaction with macrophages
through surface receptors, such as CD44, hyaluronan-mediated motility
receptor, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4),
and scavenger receptor Stabilin-2 (STAB2).19,29 These receptors, particularly CD44, have been introduced as the
best candidate for HA-mediated targeting of various cell types, including
macrophages, by which the circulation time of small particles can
be extended and the polarization process can be induced.30,31 As an example, plasmid-DNA-encapsulated HA-poly(ethyleneimine) nanoparticles
were designed with the average size of 186 nm to modulate macrophage
reprogramming.32

As far as we know,
there is no report demonstrating the capability of pure HA particles
to encapsulate immunoregulatory cytokines for macrophage reprogramming.
Therefore, we contemplated the design of such carriers to concurrently
protect and deliver IL-4 biomolecules to the macrophages. The suggested
platform can be used for combined targeting and polarization of macrophages
toward M2 phenotype. The developed IL-4-loaded carrier is composed
of HA polymer assembled through the formation of water-in-oil inverse
microemulsion droplet and divinyl sulfone (DVS)-mediated covalent
cross-linking. The process of carrier synthesis is schematically summarized
in Figure 1. The physicochemical
characterization, biocompatibility, and cellular effect of HA particles
made of low, medium, and high MW of the polymer were assessed. The
one with the highest M2 polarization capability was then chosen for
the loading of IL-4 and immunity modulation via targeted delivery
of the IL-4 cytokine to obtain synergistic M2-polarizing effect of
the HA polymer and the drug on the macrophages.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of the synthesis procedure for HA particles containing IL-4 within
the dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt (AOT) reverse micelles. HA
polymer solution containing IL-4 was added into the isooctane containing
AOT and 1-heptanol (1-HP), forming inverse emulsion droplets through
the coverage of the HA and IL-4 within the amphiphilic AOT chains.
Next, DVS addition resulted in the covalent binding of HA chains and
the formation of interpenetrating networks, which are able to retain
the IL-4 intact for further targeting to macrophages through the high
tendency of HA toward CD44 surface ligands.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Physicochemical
Characterization of HA Particles
HA is a very important natural
polymer, existing in different cells and tissues of the human body
with key biological functions in cell signaling and proliferation,
organization of the extracellular matrix, joint lubrication, and wound
healing.20,24,33−35 Owing to its biocompatibility and biodegradation, great attention
toward drug delivery, biotargeting, and tissue-engineering features
of this polymer has been given in recent years.24,25,30,31,33,36,37 Since the MW-dependent biological impacts of HA polymer have been
previously proved,28 in the current study,
we aimed to figure out the effect of HA particles, prepared with varied
MWs of the polymer, on the macrophages and then select the best one
for further investigation of IL-4 loading and synergistic M2 polarization.

Spherical-shaped particles were produced by means of various MWs
of HA within the reverse micelles of AOT. Figure 2a demonstrates that the average size of the
particles instantly increased from ∼900 nm to 1.2 μm
as a function of MW increment (LMW, MMW, and HMW are representative
of the HA particles prepared by low, middle, and high MW polymers,
respectively). This observation can be associated with the longer
polymer chains of the polymer with higher MW, which produced bigger
DVS-mediated chemically cross-linked networks.

MMW, and HMW represent the particles prepared with low, middle, and
high MW HA, respectively. (a) Size and ζ-potential of the HA

stretching frequencies of DVS. (c) Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
of the HA particles. (d) Size–pH correlation of the HA particles.
(e) ζ-Potential of the particles at different pH conditions
in a 0.01 M KCl solution. The pH was adjusted using 0.1 M NaOH and
0.1 M HCl. (f–h) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of the HA particles prepared by low (f), middle (g), and high (h)
MW of the HA polymer. Scale bars are 2 μm.

The surface charges of all types of particles were also measured.
The negative surface of the particles prepared with HMW polymer was
significantly higher than the particles prepared with LMW polymer
(Figure 2a). It is
plausible that the higher number of carboxyl groups on HA polymer
with a longer chain resulted in a clear shifting of the ζ-potential
of the prepared particles toward lower negative values.

Next,
attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR)
spectra of HA particles were taken to demonstrate successful formation
of the particles through the cross-linking of the HA and DVS. In all
types of the prepared particles, distinctive bands at 1602 cm–1 were observable for −COOH functional groups
of the disaccharide units in HA, and the bands at 1030 cm–1 appeared for S–O and C–S stretching frequencies of
DVS (Figure 2b).

Thermal behavior of the HA particles showed no remarkable effect
of the MW on the TG thermograms that were taken by 10 °C/min
heating rate (Figure 2c). In general, two distinct degradation temperatures were observed
for HA particles. The first step of degradation started at 210–230
°C depending on the MW of the polymer. In this step, 50–60%
of the total weight was lost before reaching 300 °C. When the
temperature reached 650 °C, the second degradation pattern started and continued
up to 850 °C in which the remained weights of all types of the
particles were less than 15%.

To investigate the stability of
the HA particles in different pH values (ranging from 3 to 11), the
changes in particle size and ζ-potential of HA particles were
measured with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and their corresponding
graphs are shown in Figure 2d. The HA particles did not show any significant change in
their size with pH alteration from 3 to 11. Despite the presence of
carboxyl groups, the particles did not swell in basic pH conditions
due to their compact and nonporous nature achieved by high chemical
cross-linking with DVS. In contrast, the surface ζ-potential
of all HA particles changed from ca. +5 to −30 mV by increasing
the pH from 2 to 10 (Figure 2e). The positive surface charge of the HA particles at pH
2 is related to the high rate of protonation on hydroxyl groups of
the particles.

The SEM images of the HA particles (Figure 2f–h) showed
spherical morphology, which demonstrates no impact of the polymer
MW on the shape of the final product. In addition, the observation
is in line with the data achieved from DLS measurement, showing the
majority of the particles with the size of around 1 μm. However,
bigger particles could also be observed in all samples, varying in
the range of 1–5 μm.

2.2 In Vitro
Biocompatibility
To assess the in vitro safety and high cytocompatibility
of different HA particles fabricated by various MWs of the polymer,
a cell viability assay was performed on different cell lines, including
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), KG-1 macrophages, and J774A.1
macrophages after treatment with the carriers at a concentration range
of 25–600 μg/mL for 24 and 48 h at 37 °C. As shown
in Figure 3a, all tested
concentrations showed high cytocompatibility on all three cell lines
tested. The viability of the cells slightly reduced by increasing
the incubation time and the concentration of the particles. However,
all values remained desirably above 80% in all time points of various
concentrations. Previous studies have shown the distinct effect of
the MW on cellular function of the cells treated with HA.28,38 HMW HA was able to suppress cell cycle via binding to CD44, whereas
cell proliferation was stimulated by LMW HA when interacted with CD44.22,37,39,40 However, in our study, we just observed 20% variation in the viability
of the cells exposed to particles prepared with different MWs of HA
polymer (Figure 3a).
In another study, researchers have shown the promotion of cell proliferation
after treatment with HMW HA.21 These differences
and controversies might be attributed to the cell type, variation
of the polymer MW in different studies, and the form of HA (e.g.,
polymer solution, nanoparticles, microparticles, or as a coating layer
for other nanomaterials) used for the studies. All these factors can
affect the regulation of signaling pathways through the change in
the internalization of the polymer into the cells.25 Overall, these results showed acceptable in vitro safety
and biocompatibility of HA-based particles, which can be therefore
used as carriers for drug delivery applications.

polymer. The effect of HA’s MW on cell viabilities of PBMC,

in a range of 25–600 μg/mL. (b) Hemocompatibility of
the HA-based particles during the screening period of 24 h. The tested
concentrations include 100, 200, and 400 μg/mL of HA particles.
LMW, MMW, and HMW are representative of the HA particles prepared
by low, middle, and high molecular weight polymers, respectively.

2.3 Hemocompatibility
Red blood cells (RBCs) are the most abundant cells in the bloodstream
and in very close contact with the particulate drug delivery systems
after intravenous injection. Therefore, there is a risk of deformation
and cell membrane damage if the particles are toxic.41,42 To investigate the effect of the HA’s MW on the lysis of
RBCs, HA-based particles, in a concentration range of 100–400
μg/mL, were exposed to the hemoglobins. When treated for 1 and
6 h, the RBC lysis was much less than the longer exposure time (24
h) in all the HA-based particles tested (Figure 3b), demonstrating the dependency of the hemolysis
rate to the exposure time. Whereas 100 μg/mL of all the HA-based
carriers induced less than 4% hemolysis after 24 h, 400 μg/mL
of the particles could meaningfully enhance the rate of hemolysis
to more than 9%, especially in cells treated by MMW HA-based particles.
This indicates concentration and MW dependency in hemolysis effect
of HA particles.

Overall, our data represented a direct relationship
of concentration, MW, and exposure time with the hemolysis rate of
the RBCs. The induction of hemolysis was higher for MMW and HMW HA-based
particles as compared to the LMW HA-based counterparts; however, it
was less than 10% in all cases. The high hemocompatibility of the
HA particles can be explained through the hydrophilicity and negative
surface charge of the particles that prevent their interaction and
penetration into the RBCs due to surface negative charges and hydrophobic
lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. The comparison of MWs showed
that LMW HA-based particles caused lower hemolysis rate presumably
due to the relatively weaker interaction with the cell surface. It
can be due to varying structural conformations of HAs with various
MWs in solution, resulting from differences in flexibility and viscosity
of HA chains.27

2.4 Impact
of HA Particles on Resting and Activated Macrophages
Depending
on their cellular phenotype and cytokine secretion pattern, macrophages
are able to either mediate or suppress inflammatory responses. Programmed
switching of macrophages from an inflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory
(M2) phenotype renders substantial benefit for the treatment of inflammatory
and autoimmune diseases, as well as the regeneration of injured tissues.
It was previously shown that the MWs of polymers have the capability
of eliciting different biological responses.20,25 In this regard, before IL-4 loading into the HA particles, the role
of MW on the reprogramming of macrophages was investigated. To provide
a synergistic effect for IL-4 payloads, we were looking for a polymer
with M2-polarizing effect as a carrier for this cytokine. Therefore,
the impact of particles prepared by low, middle, and high MWs of the
HA polymer was investigated on the arginase-1 (Arg-1) expression,
TNF-α release, and IL-10 production in resting macrophages,
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, and LPS + IFN-γ
costimulated macrophages (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Impact of MW of the HA particles on Arg-1 expression,
TNF-α suppression, and the induction of IL-10 secretion in the
(a) resting, (b) LPS-triggered, and (c) classically activated J774A.1
macrophages. The schematics demonstrate the time course of the experiments.
LMW and MMW HA particles had minimal eliciting effect on M2 polarization
since very slight changes in the expressions of Arg-1 and IL-10 release
were observed. In contrast, HMW HA particles could more remarkably
reduce the level of TNF-α in all three tested conditions and
could also increase the Arg-1 and IL-10 levels. Error bars represent
mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments.

For the resting macrophages shown
in Figure 4a, Arg-1
expression was significantly upregulated after treatment with particles
made of HMW HA, whereas treatment with LMW and MMW HA particles demonstrated
lower population of the Arg-1 positive cells. Arg-1 expression on
cell surface is a signature of M2 macrophage polarization.10,43 TNF-α production in macrophages treated by HMW HA particles
was also lower than other types of particles and the nontreated cells.
Although this test was performed with the HA particles, the finding
was in line with previous reports that showed the ability of the HMW
HA polymer in solution form for the suppression of TNF-α production,
known as an indicator of anti-inflammatory response for the M2 polarization
of the macrophages.28 This finding shows
the potential of the developed particles with HMW HA polymer to develop
drug-loaded carriers for AD therapy through M2 macrophage activity.

Next, the secretion of IL-10 was examined, and it demonstrated
a significant upregulation in resting macrophages treated with HMW
polymer compared to the other conditions examined. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory
cytokine generally produced by M2 macrophages, and the upregulation
of IL-10 proves the successful transition from M1 to M2 phenotype
via HA treatment. As expected, particles prepared by HMA HA could
downregulate the production of M1 cytokines, such as TNF-α,
but upregulate IL-10 secretion as a known M2 cytokine.27 This finding suggests that not only the polymeric
solution of HA, but also the particulate form of HMA HA can elicit
M2 state from resting macrophages.

In the next step, HA and
LPS were simultaneously exposed to the resting macrophages to mimic
an acute classical inflammatory response against LPS, an antigen derived
from Gram-negative bacterial wall. According to previous reports,
LPS is able to mediate acute inflammation as a potent macrophage activator
and to produce many inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α and
IL-6.36,44 It is revealed in Figure 4b that the highest Arg-1 expression was acquired
in macrophages treated with HMW HA particles, and other types showed
no significant differences compared to the control. It is also shown
that TNF-α secretion tended to increase in the presence of LPS
that exemplifies the high sensitivity of macrophages to the inflammatory
challenge with LPS. Cotreatment with LPS and HA particles resulted
in contrary effect with decreasing TNF-α level in an MW-dependent
manner. As it is clear in Figure 4b, macrophages treated with HMW HA particles decreased
TNF-α secretion in a magnitude of six compared to the LPS-treated
macrophages. In the case of IL-10, the highest secretion level was
observed following treatment with HMW HA particles by which the activation
of macrophages toward M2 phenotype is strongly feasible, whereas LPS
alone and particles prepared by low and middle MW of HA did not have
any capability to increase the secretion level of IL-10.

Next,
the impacts of HA particles on classically activated macrophages were
investigated in the presence of both IFN-γ and LPS. There are
many chronic diseases associated with classically activated state
of macrophages as it can have huge detrimental effects on various
tissues.45−48 Therefore, we tried to mimic the classically activated macrophages
through pretreatment with both IFN-γ and LPS to represent a
robust inflammatory response before exposure to HA particles. Development
of a particulate system, which can alter the population of such macrophages,
would have a remarkable role in the alteration of macrophage function
within damaged tissue. As shown in Figure 4c, it is obviously clear that the greatest
increase in Arg-1 expression was observed in macrophages treated with
HMW HA, which was significantly higher than those of LMW and MMW HA
particles. Compared to LPS-treated macrophages, TNF-α production
was increased fourfold more in the presence of LPS + INF-γ,
demonstrating the potential of INF-γ for macrophage activation
in certain chronic inflammatory conditions.36 In this experiment, macrophages were classically activated for 24
h, and then, the media were replaced with media containing HA particles.
After 24 h of the treatment with HA particles with various MWs, increased
Arg-1 expression and IL-10 secretion, as well as reduced level of
TNF-α production was observed for HMW particles. In all cases,
an MW-dependent trend was observed. In general, these data prove that
treatment with HMW HA particles elicits signals needed for the M2
polarization of macrophages.

2.5 Cellular Targeting and
M1 to M2 Repolarization
The main prerequisite for the targeting
of macrophages by HA particles is the high availability of CD44 receptor
on the surface of the cell membrane. Therefore, the expression of
CD44 was evaluated on J774A.1 macrophages by confocal microscopy and
flow cytometry instruments. Figure 5a,b shows the strong fluorescence of the cell membrane
stained with FITC-CD44 antibody and a clear shift in the histogram
of J774A.1, respectively. The indicated high expression of CD44 on
the cell membrane confirms the potential of HA particles to target
these cells. Time-dependent efficient in vitro cellular uptake (Figure 5c), which occurred
by the HMW particles of HA, could possibly confirm CD44 receptor recognition
by the particles and subsequent promotion in their interaction with
the cell membrane and enhanced endocytosis.49 In the polymeric backbone of the HA, the C6-OH of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAC) forms hydrogen bonding to CD44 on the
macrophages. HA is a polymer with repetitive units of the GlcNAC and
another ring functionalized with −COOH and −OH. Considering
the low amount of the DVS and observed data of efficient CD44 targeting,
it seems there are many of the free C6-OH of GlcNAC groups in the
structure of HA for CD44 targeting after conjugation with DVS, confirmed
by the FTIR bond at 3500 cm–1, corresponding to
−OH groups of the HA particles (Figure 2).

uptake of the HMW particles of HA in J774A.1 macrophages. The uptake
of the particles into the cells increased over time. (d) Change in
the ratio of Arg-1 to iNOS after 24 and 48 h of treatment with IL-4-loaded
(HMW-IL-4) and unloaded (HMA) HA particles. This is indicative of
the M2/M1 ratio of the macrophages, which were initially triggered
by LPS and IFN-γ toward the M1 phenotype. (e, f) Flow cytometry
histograms of the CD206 and CD163 expressions in LPS- and IFN-γ-stimulated
J774A.1 macrophages without and with exposure to IL-4-loaded (HMW-IL-4)
and unloaded (HMA) HA particles for 48 h at the concentration of 100
μg/mL (1.2 mL).

The internalization of the IL-4-loaded particles would then
increase the expression and production of M2-polarizing genes, proteins,
and biomolecules, as shown in Figure 5d–f, and the switching of M1 polarized macrophages
toward M2 phenotype. In this experiment, J774A.1 macrophages were
first treated with LPS and IFN-γ for 16 h to increase the expression
of M1 markers.32 Next, the stimulated cells
were treated with the IL-4-loaded HA particles, and the expressions
of M2 markers were determined. The yield of the particle formation
was ca. 90%, and the calculated amount of IL-4 in 100 μg of
HA particles was 51.4 ± 2.8 ng (equal to a loading efficiency
of ca. 92.5%).

The M1 macrophages present high expression levels
of CD80, TNF-α, and iNOS, whereas the M2a polarization of macrophages
is associated with a decrease in M1 markers and an increase in Arg-1,
CD163, and CD206 levels. Therefore, to investigate if IL-4-loaded
HA particles could repolarize the macrophages from M1 to M2a phenotypes,
Arg-1/iNOS (Arg-1/iNOS) ratio was measured by qPCR in the M1 phenotype
cells treated with the particles for 24 and 48 h (Figure 5d). According to previous reports,50 the M2 polarization of macrophages is associated
with a decreased expression of iNOS and an increase in Arg-1 level.
Therefore, the ratio of Arg-1 to iNOS can be an indication of macrophage
polarization to M2 phenotype. As shown in Figure 5d, the Arg-1/iNOS ratio was remarkably low
in the M1 macrophages, indicating the high expression of iNOS and
low expression of Arg-1. In contrast, this ratio was dramatically
increased after treatment with both unloaded and IL-4-loaded particles
for 24 and 48 h. The Arg-1/iNOS ratio was higher in the IL-4-loaded
particles compared to the unloaded counterparts at both time points,
demonstrating the effect of IL-4 on the enhanced M2 repolarization
of the macrophages. Furthermore, the observed time-dependent increase
in the Arg-1/iNOS ratio can presumably be attributed to the sustained
release of IL-4 within the cells after internalization.

As specific
surface markers for M2a macrophages,51 the
change in the expressions of CD206 and CD163 was evaluated in the
J774A.1 macrophages. Figure 5e,f show the histograms of CD206 and CD163 expressions in
M1 J774A.1 macrophages exposed to the unloaded and IL-4-loaded particles
for 48 h. The LPS- and IFN-γ-treated M1 macrophages were considered
as control. The shift to the higher fluorescence intensity values
was observed for both CD206 and CD163 proteins after treatment with
the unloaded and loaded particles, indicating the upregulation of
M2 surface markers. The shifting of the histogram was higher for the
IL-4-loaded HA particles compared to the unloaded one. This result
suggests that the loading of IL-4 plays a significant role in the
efficient M2 polarization of the cells after the cellular uptake of
the particles.

In general, the developed HA carriers could induce
immunoregulatory responses against autoimmunity and inflammatory reactions,
possibly without impairing immunity against infections or tumors that
will be explored in the next steps. Dynamic switching of M1 and M2
macrophages has a key impact on the restoration of normal function
in all tissues after injury or infection.52−54 For example,
it has been shown that metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes
can be exacerbated by M1 macrophages but ameliorated by M2 ones.46,55 IL-4 is one of the main anti-inflammatory cytokines that can suppress
the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and induce M2 polarization
for the therapy of various inflammatory disease models.13,15,16,47 Nevertheless, IL-4-mediated therapy is hampered due to the short
half-life of this biomolecule and rapid degradation, and its compensation
requires a high dose of the cytokine and toleration of inevitable
systemic side effects.10 This drawback
was recently circumvented by viral transduction of the IL-4 gene.56 Since the delivery of exogenous genes to human
needs to meet certain safety regulations and cannot specifically affect
the macrophages, our present work aimed for the first time to demonstrate
an efficient targeted delivery system for IL-4 toward CD44-positive
macrophages for the future translation of exogenous IL-4 into clinic
with minimal concern as compared to other suggested approaches.

3 Conclusions
In this study, the polarization
of macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes was reported
by IL-4-encapsulated HA carriers. The HA particles were successfully
synthesized from various MWs of the HA polymer using a simple method,
and the characterization and toxicity studies showed their high safety
and desirable properties for drug delivery. Further investigation
demonstrated that HA particles prepared from HMW polymers significantly
increase the anti-inflammatory markers of the macrophages, whereas
the particles fabricated from LMW and MMW polymers had negligible
effect on the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore,
HMW polymer was used for IL-4 loading and M2 differentiation studies.
The particles were able to efficiently interact by J774A.1 macrophages
that express the CD44 receptor. Importantly, in vitro treatment of
the M1 macrophages with IL-4-loaded HA particles enhanced the Arg-1/iNOS
gene expression levels. Moreover, the CD206 and CD163 expressions
were upregulated as the known markers of M2a macrophages. The results
indicate that macrophages were successfully skewing their phenotype
from M1 to M2 using the anti-inflammatory cytokine-loaded HA particle,
suggesting its high potential for the targeted treatment of various
autoimmune and inflammation-associated diseases.

4 Experimental
Methods
4.1 Materials
Dioctyl sulfosuccinate
sodium salt (AOT), 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane, anhydrous),
divinyl sulfone (DVS), 1-heptanol (1-HP), acetone dichlorofluorescin-diacetate, N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS),
and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical
Co (Germany). CellTiter-Glo Luminescence Cell Viability assay kit
was obtained from Promega Corporation. HA (sodium salt, 10–20,
151–300, and 1.01–1.8 kDa) was purchased from Lifcore
Biomedical Co. Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated rabbit anti-CD163/M130 polyclonal
antibody was purchased from Bioss Antibodies. Alexa Fluor 488-antimouse
CD206 and CD44 antibodies were obtained from BioLegend. J774A.1-adherent
murine macrophage cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from HyClone, Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) was from Cellgro, and penicillin/streptomycin
antibiotics were from Gibco Invitrogen. Specific primers of Arg-1
and iNOS2 were purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon. Recombinant Mouse
IL-4 and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for IL-10, TNF-α, and IL-4 were obtained from R&D Systems.

4.2 Synthesis of HA Microparticles
HA microparticles
were synthesized using the reverse micelle cross-linking technique
and the formation of a water-in-oil inverse microemulsion droplets,
as shown in Figure 1. The aqueous phase was prepared by dissolving HA in NaOH (0.2 M)
at a concentration of 4 mg/mL. The organic phase was isooctane containing
0.2 M of AOT and 0.04 M of 1-HP in isooctane. To prepare the droplets,
0.25 mL of HA solution was added to 7.5 mL of isooctane containing
0.2 M of AOT and 0.04 M of 1-HP under vigorous agitation until a clear
solution was obtained. Next, 4 μL of DVS cross-linker was added
under vortexing, and the reaction was allowed to complete for 1 h
under stirring at room temperature. Particles were precipitated using
100 mL of acetone and then collected by centrifugation at 10 000
rpm for 10 min. Next, the particles were washed three times with acetone
and water mixture (1:1 v/v) and once with water before using them
in other experiments.

4.3 Characterization of the
HA Particles
The sizes (hydrodynamic diameter) and ζ-potentials of the HA
particles prepared by low, middle, and high molecular weight HAs were
measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments
Ltd, U.K.). For this purpose, particles were dispersed in 0.01 M of
KNO3 solution in water and then sonicated for 20 min to
obtain highly dispersed particles.

The changes in the sizes
of particles synthesized with LMW, MMW, and HMW HAs were determined
in different pH values, ranging from 2 to 11, using a particle size
analyzer. The pH was adjusted with 1 M of HCl and 1 M of NaOH. The
measurements were performed in a solution of NaCl (100 mM) to ensure
fixed ionic strength for all measurements. In addition, the surface
characterization of the particles was investigated by ζ-potential
measurements at various pH values in 0.01 M of KCl solution. Before
the study, the HA particles were passed through paper filters with
pore size >2 μm to ensure there is no larger HA particle
for proper measurement within the operational size limit of the DLS
instrument. Each sample was measured in triplicate, and average size
and ζ-potential were reported with standard deviation (SD).

Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR)
study was carried out to investigate the chemical compositions of
the HA particles. A PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer equipped
with a diamond crystal ATR accessory was used for this purpose. The
particles were freeze-dried, and the powder was used for spectra recording
in the wavenumber region of 4000–1000 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1.

The thermal
stability of the particles was determined by thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) using Q500 Thermogravimetric Analyzers. The thermogravimetry
measurements were carried out under continuous N2 flow
(200 mL/min). The heating rate was 10 °C/min to reach up to 950
°C.

SEM (FEI Quanta 200) study was also performed to monitor
the morphology of different particles. Samples were separately embedded
on the SEM holder covered by a double-sided carbon adhesive tape.
The particles were then dried at room temperature overnight and then
sputtered by Pt in a high vacuum evaporator before imaging.

4.4 Cell Lines and Culturing Condition
Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC), KG-1 macrophage cells, and J774A.1 macrophages
were used for different studies of the present work. Iscove’s
modified Dulbecco’s medium and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) were used for the KG-1 and J774A.1, respectively. The
media used in this study were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal FBS,
1% l-glutamine, penicillin (100 IU/mL), 1% nonessential amino
acids, and streptomycin (100 mg/mL) (all from HyClone). The cells
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in
75 cm2 culture flasks (Corning Inc. Life Sciences). Cells
were cultured in a standard gas incubator with the conditions of 95%
humidity, 5% CO2, and 37 °C. Confluency of 80% was
considered for the subculturing of the cells. Phosphate buffer solution–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (PBS–EDTA) solution was used for cell detachment prior
to passaging, as well as prior to each experiment.

4.5 Cellular Cytotoxicity
The ATP activity of the cells
was investigated for cytocompatibility assessment because it is representative
of mitochondrial function. For this purpose, 100 μL of the cell
suspension (2 × 105 cells/mL) was seeded in 96-well
plates and left in an incubator at 37 °C overnight. Next, the
cell media were removed and 100 μL of the HA particles with
the concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 600 μg/mL were
added into the wells containing cells. After 24 and 48 h of incubating
cells with the particles, 100 μL of the reagent assay (CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, Promega) was added to each well.
The 96-well plates were shaken for 2 min at 450 rpm and left at room
temperature for 15 min before measuring the luminescence of the wells.
Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) buffer solution was used
as the negative control and treated similarly as described above and
considered as 100% viability. The results presented are the average
of at least three independent measurements.

4.6 Hemocompatibility
Assay
Heparinized fresh human blood samples were used for
the isolation of red blood cells (RBCs). First, 5 mL of blood was
mixed with 10 mL of D-PBS and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 6 min. This
step was repeated five times, and the final RBC pellet was used to
prepare 5% hematocrit suspension by mixing 1 mL of the packed RBC
with 19 mL of D-PBS. The hemolytic effect of the HA particles was
investigated by adding 200 μL of the 5% hematocrit to 800 μL
of the different HA particle suspensions in D-PBS to reach the final
concentrations of 100, 200, and 400 μg/mL. Each of the samples
was vortexed for 5 s and subsequently incubated at room temperature
for 1, 6, and 24 h. In each time point, the samples were gently vortexed
for 5 s and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 3 min. A 100 μL amount
of the supernatant was withdrawn and added to 96-well plates (Corning
Inc. Life Sciences) for the quantification of the lysed hemoglobin
at 577 nm. D-PBS and Milli-Q water were used as negative and positive
controls, respectively. The results represent the average of, at least,
three independent experiments.

4.7 Arg-1
Activity and Cytokine Measurement
To study the impact of
polymer MW on the polarization of the macrophages, pure particles
were exposed to J774A.1 macrophages in the presence or absence of
HA particles in different conditions, including (1) in the resting
state of macrophages, that is, adding HA particles in the absence
of activating agents; (2) with 100 ng/mL of γ-irradiated lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) derived from Escherichia coli (Sigma-Aldrich); and (3) with 10 ng/mL interferon-γ (IFN-γ)
and 100 ng/mL γ-irradiated LPS. For all in vitro studies, J774A.1
macrophages were plated at a density of 2.8 × 105 cells/mL
in a 12-well plate (1.2 mL/well) and allowed to adhere overnight before
use. HA particles were used at the concentration of 100 μg/mL
for these studies.

Flow cytometry experiment was performed to
quantitatively assess the expression of Arg-1 in the cells as an indicator
of M2 polarization in macrophages. For this experiment, resting macrophages
were treated as described above for 24 h. The well plates were then
washed with HBSS–(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid) (HEPES) (pH 7.4), and cells were harvested using PBS–EDTA
solution. Thereafter, detached cells were diluted with 5 mL of HBSS–(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid) (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.4) and transferred into 15 mL Falcon tubes
to separate cells through centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 4 min. Samples
were then dispersed in 0.5 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature
for 10 min under intermittent agitation to maintain a single cell
suspension during the fixation process. Cells were centrifuged and
washed two times with PBS (pH 7.4) before resuspending in 200 μL
of permeabilization buffer. Next, 10 μL of fluorescein conjugated
Arg-1 antibody (R&D Systems) was added and cells incubated for
30 min at room temperature in the dark. The cells were washed once
with permeabilization buffer and transferred into FACS tubes after
resuspending in 500 μL of PBS (pH 7.4) for flow cytometric analysis
with a laser excitation wavelength of 488 nm.

TNF-α and
IL-10 secreted by macrophages under different treatments were determined
by the measurement of the proteins in the supernatant of the cell
culture using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D
Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
amount of IL-4 loaded into the particles was measured using the ELISA
method.10

4.8 Cellular
Interaction of the HA Particles with J774A.1 Macrophages
The cellular interaction of the HMW particles of HA polymer with
J774A.1 macrophage cells was performed using the Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated
particles. EDC–NHS-mediated labeling of the HA particles was
carried out through the previous reports of our group for other nanocarriers.57 Flow cytometry experiment was conducted to determine
the percentage of cells associated with the HA particles. In a 6-well
plate, a density of 5 × 105 cells/well was prepared
in 3.5 mL of the culturing medium. After overnight preincubation at
37 °C and 5% CO2, the cells were washed once with
HBSS–HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated with 3.5 mL of fluorescently
labeled particles (100 μg/mL) for 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min.
Washing was then performed by HBSS–HEPES (pH 7.4) to remove
free particles. The cells were detached by 300 μL of PBS–EDTA
and centrifuged within 5 mL of HBSS–HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) at
1200 rpm for 4 min. The cells were resuspended in 700 μL of
the HBSS–HEPES (pH 7.4) and kept in ice for flow cytometry
analysis of the samples with a laser excitation wavelength of 488
nm.

4.9 IL-4 Loading into HA Particles
To
load the IL-4 cytokine within the HMW HA particles, 0.25 mL of HA
solution (4 mg/mL) was transferred into a tube containing 500 ng of
the IL-4 in 50 μL. After a gentle vortexing, the mixture was
added dropwise into 7.5 mL of isooctane containing 0.2 M of AOT and
0.04 M of 1-HP under vigorous agitation until a clear solution was
obtained. Next, 4 μL of DVS cross-linker was added under vortexing,
and the reaction was allowed to complete for 1 h under stirring at
room temperature. The procedure was continued similar to the synthesis
process without the cytokine. Loaded amount of IL-4 into HA particles
was measured through the collection of the supernatant and its analysis
by IL-4 ELISA kits right after particle formation.

4.10 Analyses of CD44, CD206, and CD163 Expressions on Macrophage
J774A.1 macrophages were plated in six-well plates with a density
of 4 × 105 cells/well, cultured at 37 °C and
5% CO2 overnight. For the evaluation of CD44 expression,
unpolarized J774A.1 macrophage cells were treated with bovine albumin
serum (BSA; 3% w/v) for 30 min before 1 h staining with antimouse
CD44 antibody at room temperature. After washing thrice with PBS (pH
7.4) and fixation with the paraformaldehyde (4%) for 2 h, the cells
were imaged by confocal microscopy and analyzed by flow cytometry
for the detection of CD44 surface proteins. Nonstained unpolarized
J774A.1 macrophage cells were used as control.

For the determination
of CD206 and CD163 expressions, the cells were first polarized to
M1 phenotype by incubating with IFN-γ (100 ng/mL) and LPS (100
ng/mL) for 16 h. They were then treated with IL-4-loaded HA particles
(1.2 mL of 100 μg/mL) and unloaded particles for 48 h. After
washing and fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, 3% w/v BSA was used for
30 min at room temperature to block nonspecific bindings. The cells
were then stained with Alexa Fluor 488-antimouse CD206 and CD163 antibodies
for 1 h.

4.11 In Vitro Polarization Studies
The
effect of the IL-4-loaded HA particles on the induction of macrophage
switching from M1 to M2 phenotype was assessed by measuring the change
in the expression level of inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (iNOS2)
as M1 marker and Arg-1 as M2 marker in J774A.1 macrophages. After
the exposure of the cells (3 × 105 cells/well) to
LPS (100 ng/mL) and IFN-γ (100 ng/mL) in 6-well plates for 16
h, the cells were exposed to the IL-4-encapsulated particles (1.2
mL of 100 μg/mL) and free particles for 24 h. Next, the cells
were divided into two groups: (1) washing with PBS and quantification
of the expression of iNOS2 and Arg-1 using qPCR (called 24 h samples
in the Results and Discussion section) and
(2) harvesting the cells and culturing them in the cell culturing
medium for 24 h more before qPCR study (called 24 h samples in the Results and Discussion section). The ratio of Arg-1
to iNOS2 was considered as indicative of M1 to M2 polarization efficiency.

4.12 Data Analysis
Data were expressed as mean
± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was determined
by one-way analysis of variance tests to compare statistical significance
at a 5% probability level. A probability (p) of less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
