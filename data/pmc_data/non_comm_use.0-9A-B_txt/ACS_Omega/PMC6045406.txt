The
nickel PNP pincer complex (iPrPNP)NiPh (iPrPNP =
κP,κN,κP-N(CH2CH2PiPr2)2) was prepared by reacting (iPrPNP)NiBr with PhMgCl or deprotonating [(iPrPNHP)NiPh]Y (iPrPNHP = κP,κN,κP-HN(CH2CH2PiPr2)2; Y = Br, PF6) with KOtBu. The byproducts of
the PhMgCl reaction were identified as [(iPrPNHP)NiPh]Br and (iPrPNP′)NiPh (iPrPNP′ = κP,κN,κP-N(CH=CHPiPr2)(CH2CH2PiPr2)). The methyl analog (iPrPNP)NiMe was synthesized from the reaction of (iPrPNP)NiBr with MeLi, although it was contaminated
with (iPrPNP′)NiMe due
to ligand oxidation. Protonation of (iPrPNP)NiX (X = Br, Ph, Me) with various acids, such as HCl,
water, and MeOH, was studied in C6D6. Nitrogen
protonation was shown to be the most favorable process, producing
a cationic species [(iPrPNHP)NiX]+ with the NH moiety hydrogen-bonded to the
conjugate base (i.e., Cl–, HO–, or MeO–). Protonation of the Ni–C bond
was observed at room temperature with (iPrPNP)NiMe, whereas at 70 °C with (iPrPNP)NiPh, both resulting in [(iPrPNHP)NiCl]Cl as the final product.
Protonation of (iPrPNP)NiBr
was complicated by site exchange between Br– and
the conjugate base and by the degradation of the pincer complexes.
Indene, which lacks hydrogen-bonding capability, was unable to protonate
(iPrPNP)NiPh and (iPrPNP)NiMe, despite being more acidic
than water and MeOH. Neutral and cationic nickel pincer complexes
involved in this study, including (iPrPNP′)NiBr, (iPrPNP)NiPh, (iPrPNP′)NiPh,
(iPrPNP)NiMe, [(iPrPNHP)NiPh]Y (Y = Br, PF6, BPh4), [(iPrPNHP)NiPh]2[NiCl4], [(iPrPNHP)NiMe]Y (Y = Cl, Br, BPh4), [(iPrPNHP)NiBr]Br, and [(iPrPNHP)NiCl]Cl, were characterized by X-ray crystallography.

Introduction
The advances of metal–ligand bifunctional catalysis have
provided the momentum for the recent surge in developing base metal-catalyzed
(de)hydrogenation reactions.1−9 The key to the success of these reactions is often attributed to
ligand participation in proton-transfer steps, which helps activate
substrates while deemphasizing the roles that metals need to play.
One particularly effective and popular ligand system has the general
formula HN(CH2CH2PR2)2 (abbreviated here as RPNHP),10 which is commonly referred to as PNP pincer when the ligand
adopts the meridional coordination mode. Over the past few years,
Ni,11−14 Co,11,15−21 Fe,22−30 and Mn complexes31−33 bearing the PNP pincer ligands or their deprotonated
form [N(CH2CH2PR2)2]− (abbreviated here as RPNP) have been successfully
produced, many of which have shown excellent catalytic activity for
hydrogenation,16,21,25−42 dehydrogenation,16,22,34,35,43−52 and related transfer hydrogenation reactions.20,53 Although the presence of the NH group is not always necessary,53 especially for the reduction of olefins12,16 and CO2,54−56 its function in many (de)hydrogenation processes
has been well established.16,26,38,44,57 As illustrated by a generalized mechanism for carbonyl reduction
(Scheme 1; for clarity,
other ligands are removed), H+/H– transfer
from nitrogen/metal to the O=C bond generates the alcohol product
and an amido complex, which activates H2 to close the catalytic
cycle. The reverse process, namely, alcohol dehydrogenation, proceeds
via H+/H– transfer from the alcohol molecule
to the amido complex. Although the key features have been captured,
the missing piece of the mechanistic picture is an adduct of the alcohol
molecule and the amido species linked by a hydrogen-bonding interaction.
According to density functional theory calculations,34,43,58 such an intermediate represents
a local minimum in energy and plays a critical role in H2 activation (for hydrogenation) or elimination (for dehydrogenation).57,59 Isolation or even spectroscopic observation of this specific intermediate
has proven to be challenging or may not even be possible, yet understanding
its bonding and reactivity is essential for the further development
of the catalytic reactions.

Scheme 1 Hydrogen Transfer in (De)Hydrogenation
Reactions Catalyzed by PNP
Pincer Complexes
In this work, we chose the nickel PNP pincer system as
the platform
to probe the hydrogen-bonding interaction in question. We simplified
the research problem by focusing on the protonation of (iPrPNP)NiX (X = Br, Ph, Me) with various
Brønsted acids, including methanol and water (eq 1). In particular, products resulting
from methanol protonation should mimic the alcohol adduct depicted
in Scheme 1. In addition
to examining different acids, we varied the nickel-bound ligand X
with an objective to study its effect on the protonation reaction. 1  

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of Nickel
Phenyl Complexes
The synthesis of the nickel bromide complex
(iPrPNP)NiBr (1) was already reported
by the Arnold group in 2011.11 We thus
turned our initial attention to the target phenyl complex (iPrPNP)NiPh (2). Group
10 metal phenyl complexes supported by a pincer ligand are often readily
prepared by treating the corresponding metal halide complexes with
PhLi60−63 or PhMgX (X = Cl, Br).64−66 Applying this synthetic strategy
to the nickel PNP pincer system is, however, nontrivial. The room-temperature
reaction of 1 with PhLi did not go to completion unless
more than 3 equiv of PhLi were added, in which case a complicated
mixture was obtained. Similar phenomena were observed when Ph2Zn was employed in place of PhLi. Using PhMgCl as the source
of the phenyl group also resulted in multiple products but needed
only 1 equiv of the Grignard reagent to fully convert 1. Fortunately, the solubility difference of the products in pentane
made separation possible (see Experimental Section for details). In addition to the anticipated complex 2, a cationic nickel phenyl complex [(iPrPNHP)NiPh]Br ([2H]Br) and a neutral nickel phenyl complex
bearing a dehydrogenated PNP pincer ligand (complex 2′) were isolated (eq 2). Control experiments indicated that when exposed to air, both 1 and 2 decomposed rapidly, resulting in a mixture
of a cationic species, a complex with a dehydrogenated PNP pincer
ligand, and other unidentified species. Efforts were thus made to
avoid contact with oxygen and moisture during the synthesis of 2. Unfortunately, [2H]Br and 2′ remained present in the
crude product. 2  

Schneider and co-workers have previously
mentioned low selectivity for the reaction between [(iPrPNHP)PdCl]PF6 and a
phenyl Grignard reagent.67 They have therefore
developed an alternate route to [(iPrPNHP)PdPh]PF6 using (TMEDA)PdPhI (TMEDA
= Me2NCH2CH2NMe2), iPrPNHP, and AgPF6. Additionally, they have shown that deprotonation of [(iPrPNHP)PdPh]PF6 by KOtBu provides the neutral
phenyl complex (iPrPNP)PdPh
in good yield. We found that this strategy could also be successfully
implemented using (TMEDA)NiPhI as the starting material for the synthesis
of [(iPrPNHP)NiPh]PF6 ([2H]PF6) and 2 (Scheme 2). Alternatively, 2 could be
isolated from deprotonation of [2H]Br with KOtBu.

Scheme 2 Independent
Synthesis of Complex 2
To confirm the formation of 2′, a
nickel bromide
complex supported by the dehydrogenated PNP pincer ligand (complex 1′; see Scheme 3) was prepared first following the procedure established for
the dehydrogenation of (tBuPNP)CoCl,19 although the isolated yield
was low (8%). Synthesis of 2′ from 1′ and PhMgCl was relatively straightforward, reflecting higher stability
of 1′ and 2′ toward oxygen
and moisture. Previous studies of (iPrPNP)Ru(PMe3)H have suggested that the PNP pincer
ligand, when dehydrogenated, can be restored in the presence of H2 (1 bar).68,69 In our work, exposing a 95:5
mixture of 1 and 1′ (in C6D6) to 2 bar of H2 over a period of 5 days
showed no sign of hydrogenation of 1′ to 1. The phenyl complex 2′ also resisted
hydrogenation under similar conditions.

Scheme 3 Independent Synthesis
of Complex 2′
The nickel phenyl complexes described above were characterized
by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Consistent with the symmetries
of the molecules, 2 displays two sets of CH3 resonances in its 1H and 13C{1H}
NMR spectra, whereas 2′, [2H]Br, and [2H]PF6 each show four different
sets of CH3 resonances. The higher symmetry of 2 is further manifested by the observation of only one carbon resonance
for the CH groups of the pincer ligand. In contrast, two pincer CH
resonances are located for 2′, [2H]Br, and [2H]PF6. As
expected, the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum of 2′ displays an AB quartet for the two inequivalent
phosphorus nuclei with a large coupling constant of 259.7 Hz.

The structures of 2, 2′, [2H]Br, and [2H]PF6 were
further established by X-ray crystallography. The dehydrogenated
PNP pincer ligand in 2′ is evident from a relatively
short C(1)–C(2) distance of 1.392(3) Å (Figure 1 and Table 1), which is best described as a C=C
bond.13,19 Its C(3)–C(4) bond [1.462(3) Å],
although shorter than the C(1)–C(2) [1.517(2) Å] and C(3)–C(4)
[1.514(2) Å] bonds in 2 (Figure 2), is most consistent with a single bond.
The phenyl group in 2 and 2′ adopts
a conformation almost perpendicular to the coordination plane; the
dihedral angles between the least-square planes P(1)–P(2)–N(1)–Ni
and C(17) through C(22) were measured to be 76.34(4) and 75.60(5)°
for 2 and 2′, respectively. The sum
of angles about the nitrogen (∑N) is 354.05° for 2 and 359.49° for 2′, suggesting
that the nitrogen lone-pair electrons are delocalized into the neighboring
π-system and/or nickel. The cations of [2H]Br (Figure 3) and [2H]PF6 (Figure 4) are almost structurally identical to each
other with only slight differences in Ni–P bond lengths and
P–Ni–P angle (Table 1). Like 2 and 2′,
the phenyl group in [2H]Br and [2H]PF6 is nearly perpendicular to the coordination
plane, presumably to minimize the steric clash with the isopropyl
groups. The Ni–N bonds of [2H]Br [1.985(2) Å] and [2H]PF6 [1.999(3)
Å] are substantially longer than those of 2 [1.8932(11)Å]
and 2′ [1.9139(14) Å], which reflects the
difference between an amine and an amido donor. Perhaps the most notable
structural feature of [2H]Br is the hydrogen-bonding interaction (Table S1) between the NH group and the counterion, bromide
[NH···Br = 3.370(3) Å]. It is interesting to note
that weaker hydrogen bonds also exist in [2H]PF6 between the
NH moiety and the fluorine atoms of PF6– [NH···F = 3.021(7) Å] (Figure 4 and Table S1).
The extent of hydrogen-bonding interaction in the solid state was
probed by IR spectroscopy, which showed a broad band at 3351 cm–1 for [2H]Br and a sharp band at 3249 cm–1 in the
case of [2H]PF6, both assigned to the N–H bond stretch.

Synthesis of the cationic nickel
phenyl complex devoid of hydrogen
bonds is possible. This was accomplished by a salt metathesis reaction
between [2H]Br and
NaBPh4, as illustrated in eq 3. The product [2H]BPh4, when recrystallized in
tetrahydrofuran (THF)-pentane, provides a structure without hydrogen-bonding
interaction (Figure 5) despite the fact that THF molecules are present in the crystal
lattice. In contrast, our previous crystallographic analysis of an
iron PNP pincer complex trans-(iPrPNHP)Fe(CO)Br2 showed
that a co-crystallized THF molecule was hydrogen-bonded to the NH
group.25 Nevertheless, the lack of hydrogen
bonds in [2H]BPh4 appears to have a negligible impact on
key angles and distances (Table 1) as well as the orientation of the phenyl group. One
might have anticipated that without the N–H···X
interaction, the nitrogen is less amido like, resulting in a longer
Ni–N bond. The IR spectrum of [2H]BPh4 (solid) shows a
sharp N–H stretching band at 3181 cm–1, further
supporting that hydrogen bonds are absent in this molecule. 3  

Because the reaction of 1 with PhMgCl (eq 2) involves two different
halides,
there is a possibility that the counterion for the cationic phenyl
complex could be a mixture of Br– and Cl–. However, both elemental analysis and X-ray study (barring selective
crystallization of one compound) support the [2H]Br formulation. Pure [2H]Cl, which was obtained from protonation
of 2 by HCl (eq 4), gives similar but distinctively different NMR spectra.
In particular, the NH resonance is shifted from 5.35 ppm for [2H]Br (in CD3CN) to 6.25 ppm for [2H]Cl, consistent with a stronger hydrogen bond formed by a
more electronegative halide. The equilibrium for the halide exchange
(eq 5, approached from
both directions) apparently lies far from the [2H]Br/MgCl2 side, likely
driven by the more negative Gibbs free energy of formation for MgCl2.70 4   5  

The aforementioned cationic nickel
phenyl complexes are soluble
in polar solvents, such as acetonitrile and acetone. In benzene, the
ones with a strong hydrogen-bonding interaction ([2H]Cl and [2H]Br) are sparsely soluble, whereas the
ones with weak or no hydrogen-bonding interaction ([2H]PF6 and [2H]BPh4) are insoluble. Interestingly, a concentrated
solution of [2H]Cl in C6D6 left under an argon atmosphere for
2 weeks yielded some single crystals, which were analyzed by X-ray
crystallography as [2H]2[NiCl4] (Figure 6). As summarized in Table 1, the structural parameters of the cation are virtually the
same as those of other cationic nickel phenyl complexes. The chlorides
of [NiCl4]2– are all hydrogen-bonded,
two with the NH moieties [NH···Cl = 3.327(2) Å]
(Table S1) and the other two with co-crystallized
water molecules [OH···Cl = 3.321(5) Å].

nitrogen, are omitted for clarity.

In solution, the rotation of the phenyl group appears to
be restricted,
as judged by NMR spectroscopy. Complex [2H]PF6 or [2H]BPh4 dissolved in CD3CN exhibited two different resonances
for the ortho carbons. Although [2H]Cl or [2H]Br in CD3CN showed only one ortho carbon
resonance as a triplet, the solution in C6D6 gave a 1H NMR spectrum with two aromatic hydrogen resonances
attributable to the ortho hydrogens.

Synthesis and Characterization
of Nickel Methyl Complexes
Complex (iPrPNP)NiMe (3) has been previously prepared
by treating [(iPrPNHP)NiBr]Br with 2.5 equiv of
MeLi.71 Our attempts to repeat this synthesis
were, however, unsuccessful; other synthetic routes (for analogous
complexes65,72−78) were thus pursued. Under the conditions used for the synthesis
of 2 (eq 2), 1 reacted sluggishly with MeMgBr, as inferred by
the persistent green characteristic of 1. Extending the
reaction time (from 1 to 17 h) eventually led to the disappearance
of the green color, although NMR analysis of the crude product revealed
a very complicated mixture. A more successful route involved the reaction
of 1 with MeLi in diethyl ether (eq 6), which was previously used for the synthesis
of (CyPNP)NiMe bearing cyclohexyl groups as the phosphorus
substituents.12 The isolated material was
confirmed as the desired compound 3 although contaminated
with a small amount of byproduct 3′. The percentage
of 3′ varied from batch to batch (5–20%),
likely due to the high sensitivity of 3 toward the adventitious
O2 present during the synthesis. The amount of cationic
nickel methyl species was negligible (<1%). The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum of the isolated material shows a singlet at
68.81 ppm for 3 (in C6D6) along
with a small AB quartet at 62.71 and 49.86 ppm (JAB = 275.4 Hz) for 3′. As expected
for 3, the nickel-bound methyl group appears in the upfield
region, featuring triplets at −0.59 (JP–H = 8.6 Hz) and −26.32 ppm (JP–C = 25.6 Hz) for the proton and carbon resonances,
respectively. 6  

Cationic nickel methyl complexes [3H]Br and [3H]Cl were prepared by generating 3 in situ followed by protonation with MeOH (Scheme 4). Instead of bearing MeO– as the counterion, the isolated products contain the
original halide hydrogen-bonded to the NH moiety (vide infra). The
byproduct LiOMe is presumably stabilized by MeOH through solvation.
The halide can be removed via a salt metathesis reaction with NaBPh4, as demonstrated by a successful synthesis of [3H]BPh4 from 1.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Cationic Nickel Methyl Complexes
The 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra
of [3H]Cl, [3H]Br, and [3H]BPh4 (in CD3CN) show more splittings than 3 (in
C6D6) due to reduced symmetry. Chemical shifts
for the three cations differ only slightly. The most significantly
shifted resonances are the NH hydrogen observed as a broad triplet
([3H]Cl, 5.61 ppm; [3H]Br, 4.92 ppm; [3H]BPh4, 3.57 ppm) and NiCH3 carbon also seen as a triplet
([3H]Cl, −24.27
ppm; [3H]Br, −24.04
ppm; [3H]BPh4, −23.73 ppm). The trend for the NH chemical
shifts can be rationalized by the extent of hydrogen-bonding interaction,
which follows the order [3H]Cl > [3H]Br > [3H]BPh4.

The four nickel methyl complexes (3, [3H]Cl, [3H]Br, and [3H]BPh4) in their solid
state were studied by X-ray crystallography (Figure 7). As summarized in Table 2, there is very little structural variation
in the cation of [3H]Cl, [3H]Br, and [3H]BPh4. Similar to the phenyl series, an hydrogen-bonding interaction
(Table S1) is present between the NH moiety
and Cl–/Br– [NH···Cl
= 3.140(2) Å, NH···Br = 3.010(16) Å] but
absent when the counterion is BPh4–.
This was further supported by IR spectroscopy, which revealed a very
broad N–H stretching band for [3H]Cl (3393 cm–1) and [3H]Br (3399 cm–1), whereas a relatively sharp band for [3H]BPh4 (3189 cm–1). Compared to the neutral methyl complex 3, the Ni–N and Ni–P bonds of the cationic species are
elongated by 0.09–0.11 and 0.02–0.05 Å, respectively.
Without the proton, the amido nitrogen of 3 is nearly
flat (∑N = 353.05°), similar to that
of the phenyl complex 2 (∑N =
354.05°) but less planar than that observed for the complexes
supported by the dehydrogenated PNP pincer ligand (2′, ∑N = 359.49°; 1′, ∑N = 359.1 or 359.7°; see Supporting Information for details). Interestingly,
the related palladium complexes (iPrPNP)PdX (X = Cl, ∑N = 337.4°;
X = Me, ∑N = 345.7°)67 as well as the nickel bromide complex 1 (∑N = 348.30 or 348.35°)11 were reported to have a more pyramidal amido nitrogen.

Protonation of the Nickel
PNP Pincer Complexes
Since
the nickel halide complexes lack acid-labile Ni–C bonds, for
simplicity, their protonation reactions were investigated first (Scheme 5). As anticipated,
adding 1 equiv of HCl (2 M solution in Et2O) to the chloride
complex 4 provided [4H]Cl quantitatively as a result of nitrogen protonation.
No hydride species was observed during the reaction. Protonation of
the metal is likely to be kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable,79−81 as it would require a geometric reorganization at nickel and a formal
oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(IV). The product [4H]Cl was synthesized independently by mixing
NiCl2 with iPrPNHP and was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and elemental
analysis. IR studies showed that the N–H stretching band was
too broad to be accurately located. An N–H···Cl
interaction is observed in the crystal structure (NH···Cl
= 3.109(8) and 3.152(8) Å for the two independent molecules, Table S1). Furthermore, [4H]Cl displays a broad proton resonance
at 7.88 ppm (in CDCl3) or 9.79 ppm (in C6D6), which is in the region for an NH group participating in
strong hydrogen-bonding interaction.82 Protonation
of the bromide complex 1 in C6D6 with HBF4·Et2O also yielded a cationic
complex exclusively. The NH resonance of the product ([1H]BF4) was found at 4.44 pm, implying weak hydrogen-bonding interaction.
By comparison, the NH resonance of [1H]Br, which forms hydrogen bonds between the NH
group and the bromide (NH···Br = 3.331(15) and 3.301(15)
Å for the two independent molecules), appears at 8.74 ppm (in
C6D6). Protonation of 1 with 1
equiv of HCl is more complicated because of facile Cl–/Br– exchange at the nickel and NH sites. Comparing
the NMR data of the cationic complexes described in this study (nine
total) suggests that for these cationic species, the 31P chemical shift is primarily determined by what is bound to nickel.
This allowed us to determine the ratio of [4H]X/[1H]X to be 2:1, consistent with the notion that nickel
forms a stronger bond with a harder donor atom (i.e., Cl as opposed
to Br).83,84

Scheme 5 Protonation of Nickel Halide Complexes
Complex 1 is surprisingly
sensitive to water. When
treated with 5 equiv of degassed H2O, the solution of 1 in C6D6 exhibited a broad 31P resonance at 66.53 ppm (85%) along with a sharp 31P
resonance at 50.15 ppm (15%). Assuming that the former is a weighted
average of the chemical shifts of 1 (68.33 ppm) and its
protonated form [1H]+ (58.2 ppm), we estimated 15% of 1 being converted to [1H]OH (Scheme 6) or perhaps [1H]OH(H2O)n, in which a more elaborate hydrogen-bonding network
is established with water. The resonance at 50.15 ppm is tentatively
assigned to an isomer of [1H]OH with a Br–/OH– swap.
Isolating this minor species was not possible because the mixture
decomposed readily by releasing the free PNP pincer ligand (−1.04
ppm). It is possible that the nickel hydroxide species forms a dimer
bridged by the OH groups. In fact, related nickel hydroxide complexes
bearing a pincer ligand are known to be unstable.85,86

Scheme 6 Reaction of 1 with H2O
The reaction of 1 with MeOH (1–10
equiv) was
quite similar, forming products consistent with [(iPrPNHP)NiBr]OMe and its isomer [(iPrPNHP)NiOMe]Br as
well as the free PNP pincer ligand. The 1H NMR spectrum
of the reaction mixture also displayed an emerging triplet at −19.16
ppm (JP–H = 62.0 Hz), suggesting
the formation of a nickel hydride species. It is possible that [(iPrPNHP)NiOMe]Br proceeds
via β-hydride elimination to yield [(iPrPNHP)NiH]Br.87

Nickel–carbon bonds are susceptible to cleavage by
acids.88 Complex 2 specifically
may undergo
protonation of the phenyl group in parallel with or in competition
with protonation of the nitrogen atom. Considering that a coordinating
anion such as Cl– is needed to stabilize nickel
following phenyl protonation, we used HCl as the acid for the protonation
study. Judging from the NMR spectra, the reaction between 2 and HCl (2 M solution in Et2O) in a 1:1 stoichiometry
led rapidly and cleanly to [2H]Cl (Scheme 7). There was no evidence suggesting that a neutral or cationic
nickel chloride complex was produced. Phenyl protonation would eventually
take place if 2 equiv of HCl were initially added to 2; however, this process was shown to be extremely slow at room temperature,
converting ∼50% of the newly formed [2H]Cl to [4H]Cl over a period of 3 weeks. Raising the temperature
to 70 °C accelerated the second protonation step, resulting in
full conversion to [4H]Cl within 24 h. As one might have expected, using a substoichiometric
amount of HCl (e.g., 0.5 equiv) generated a mixture of 2 and [2H]Cl. Interestingly,
the phosphorus resonances of these two species are significantly broad,
presumably due to a rapid interconversion. In an attempt to test if [4H]Cl was generated
via elimination of Ph–H from [2H]Cl followed by protonation of the resulting nickel
chloride complex 4, pure [2H]Cl was dissolved in C6D6 and CD3CN (for easier detection of benzene) and then
heated to 70 °C. In both cases, no Ph–H elimination was
observed after monitoring the samples for 3 days.

Scheme 7 Protonation of 2 by HCl
Treatment of 2 with a weak acid, such as
MeOH or H2O, provided a rapidly equilibrated mixture of 2 and a cationic nickel phenyl complex. As illustrated by
the NMR
titration of 2 with MeOH (Figure 8), >10 equiv of MeOH are required for
complete
protonation of 2. Unlike the bromide complex 1, the mixture of 2 and H2O (5 equiv) in C6D6 showed no sign of degradation to the free PNP
pincer ligand. This can be explained by the fact that the phenyl group
is unable to dissociate from nickel (or protonated by H2O). Hydrogen-bonding interaction is critical to the protonation process.
Because our reactions were carried out in C6D6, pKa values measured in dimethyl sulfoxide
cannot be used to predict the extent of protonation. For instance,
indene (pKa = 20.1),89 which is more acidic than MeOH (pKa = 29.0) and H2O (pKa = 31.4)90 but lacks hydrogen-bonding
capability, failed to protonate 2.

Figure 8 31P{1H} NMR spectra of 2 (in
C6D6) with various amounts of MeOH added.

Replacing the phenyl group with
a more basic methyl group should
enhance the reactivity of the Ni–C bond toward acids. Indeed,
protonation of complex 3 by HCl (2 M solution in Et2O) was shown to proceed via two different routes (Scheme 8): nitrogen protonation
first (route 1) or methyl protonation first (route 2). With a large
excess of HCl (>2 equiv), 3 was fully converted to [4H]Cl with a concomitant
release of CH4. When 3 was treated with only
1 equiv of HCl, [3H]Cl was obtained as the major product (75%) along with 4 observed as the minor product (25%). Control experiments showed
that CH4 elimination from [3H]Cl was not feasible even at 70 °C, ruling
out the possibility that 4 was generated from [3H]Cl. A separate NMR experiment
established a rapid protonation of [3H]Cl by HCl to give [4H]Cl and CH4. Evidently, [4H]Cl is more acidic than [3H]Cl because the equilibrium
in eq 7 heavily favors [3H]Cl and 4 (tested from both directions). Given these results, one might propose
that 3 undergoes nitrogen protonation first, followed
by methyl protonation to yield [4H]Cl (route 1), which in turn reacts with the remaining 3 to give [3H]Cl and 4. However, this mechanism would require protonation
of the [3H]Cl methyl
group by HCl and protonation of the 3 nitrogen atom by [4H]Cl to be faster than
direct methyl protonation of 3 by HCl, which seems unlikely.
It was noted that adding 2 equiv of HCl to 3 in C6D6 caused a color change of the solution from orange
to yellow (for [4H]Cl) via a transient green color (for 4). This further
supports the viability of route 2 by which methyl protonation precedes
nitrogen protonation, although it is still kinetically less competitive
than route 1. The protonation study was also carried out using 0.5
equiv of HCl, which yielded a mixture of 3, [3H]Cl, and 4. In
contrast to the sharp phosphorous resonance attributed to 4, the spectral lines for 3 and [3H]Cl appeared quite broad, implying a rapid
process that allows these two species to interconvert. 7  

Complex 3 behaves similarly to phenyl complex 2 when reacting with weak acids. Addition of MeOH or H2O to a solution of 3 in C6D6 resulted in partial protonation of 3 to a cationic
nickel methyl species. NMR titration experiments indicated that a
complete protonation of 3 was accomplished with ∼7
equiv of MeOH (Figure S49), supporting
the notion that 3 is more basic than 2.
The protonation result is not surprising, given the success of making
cationic nickel methyl complexes from in situ generated 3 dissolved in MeOH (Scheme 4). Once again, despite being more acidic than MeOH and H2O, indene exhibited no reactivity toward 3.

Scheme 8 Two Parallel Pathways for the Protonation of 3 by HCl
Conclusions
In
this work, we have shown the propensity of (iPrPNP)NiX (X = Br, Ph, Me) to undergo nitrogen
protonation, even in the presence of a weak Brønsted acid, such
as water or MeOH. The reaction is primarily driven by the hydrogen-bonding
interaction formed between the NH group and the conjugate base. Halides,
which could come from the employed Brønsted acid (e.g., HCl)
or the starting pincer complex (e.g., (iPrPNP)NiBr), appear to form the strongest interaction
with the NH group. Thus, the synthesis of (iPrPNP)NiPh and (iPrPNP)NiMe from (iPrPNP)NiBr
is always plagued by the formation of a cationic byproduct bearing
N–H···Br bonds (eq 2), likely due to nitrogen protonation by adventitious
water, followed by OH–/Br– exchange.
Similarly, the degradation of (iPrPNP)NiBr in the presence of water (Scheme 6) or MeOH is initiated by nitrogen protonation
and facilitated by the exchange of the nickel-bound Br– with OH– or MeO–. The nitrogen
protonation and halide exchange steps can, however, be utilized to
make [(iPrPNHP)NiMe]X
(X = Cl, Br) from (iPrPNP)NiX
and MeLi following MeOH addition (Scheme 4). The Ni–C bond in (iPrPNP)NiPh and (iPrPNP)NiMe becomes labile only when a strong acid, such
as HCl, is added, and in the former case, an elevated temperature
of 70 °C is required to cleave the Ni–Csp2 bond (Scheme 7). We believe our results have important implications in the understanding
of the stability of catalysts containing an RPNHP- or RPNP-type pincer ligand, especially for reactions
that either use or generate alcohols and for processes that contain
water and/or halides. Our future work in this area will be focused
on other PNP pincer systems to examine the generality of our observations.
As far as catalytic reactions are concerned, it will also be interesting
to see if replacing the nitrogen with a less electronegative donor
(e.g., phosphorus) can improve the stability of the catalysts.

Experimental
Section
General Comments
Unless otherwise noted, all organometallic/inorganic
compounds were prepared and handled under an argon atmosphere using
standard Schlenk and inert-atmosphere box techniques. Dry and oxygen-free
solvents (THF, CH2Cl2, diethyl ether, toluene,
and pentane) were collected from an Innovative Technology solvent
purification system and used throughout the experiments. Acetone-d6 was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories
(CIL) and used as received. Benzene-d6 (purchased from CIL) was dried over Na-benzophenone and distilled
under an argon atmosphere. Acetonitrile-d3 (purchased from CIL), acetonitrile, and acetone were dried over
CaH2 and distilled under an argon atmosphere. Methanol
was dried over 4 Å molecular sieves and then degassed by bubbling
argon through it for 30 min to 1 h. All other reagents were used as
received from commercial sources. iPrPNHP,91,92 (iPrPNP)NiBr (1),11 and [(iPrPNHP)NiBr]Br ([1H]Br)11 were prepared as described in the
literature. 1H, 13C{1H}, and 31P{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance
400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shift values in 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were referenced internally to
the residual solvent resonances. Assignments were made based on DEPT-135
and 1H–13C HSQC spectra. 31P{1H} NMR spectra were referenced externally to 85% H3PO4 (0 ppm). Infrared spectra were recorded on
a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectrometer or a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two FT-IR spectrometer equipped
with a smart orbit diamond-attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory.

Synthesis of (iPrPNP)NiPh
(2), [(iPrPNHP)NiPh]Br ([2H]Br), and (iPrPNP′)NiPh (2′) from (iPrPNP)NiBr (1) and PhMgCl
Under an argon atmosphere, a 2.0 M
solution of PhMgCl in THF (500 μL, 1.0
mmol) was added dropwise to a Schlenk flask (flask #1) containing
a solution of 1 (443 mg, 1.0 mmol) in 5 mL of THF chilled
at 0 °C. The resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature,
stirred at that temperature for 1 h, and then filtered into Schlenk
flask #2, from which the solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue
in flask #2 was treated with 10 mL of pentane, resulting in a suspension,
which was filtered into Schlenk flask #3. The filtrate (in flask #3)
was dried under vacuum to give 2 as a yellow solid (219
mg, 50% yield). The solid left in flask #2 was rinsed with pentane
(collected in Schlenk flask #4) until the pentane wash was colorless.
The combined pentane washes in flask #4 were dried under vacuum to
yield a yellow solid. Recrystallization of this solid with pentane
or acetone at −25 °C yielded orange-yellow rod-shaped
crystals of 2′ (20 mg, 5% yield). The solid obtained
after exhaustive pentane washes (in flask #2) was dissolved in acetone
and then filtered through a pad of Celite to give a pale yellow solution.
This solution was dried under vacuum, and the residue was suspended
in a minimum amount of toluene. Several drops of acetone were added
to the toluene suspension until a clear solution was obtained. The
toluene–acetone solution was carefully layered with pentane
and kept at −25 °C to yield colorless plate-shaped crystals
of [2H]Br (147 mg,
28% yield).

Synthesis of (iPrPNP)NiMe
(3)
At room temperature under an argon atmosphere,
a 1.6 M solution of MeLi in diethyl ether (188 μL, 0.30 mmol)
was added dropwise to a solution of 1 (111 mg, 0.25 mmol)

vacuum, and the residue was extracted with pentane (5 mL × 2).
The pentane extracts were concentrated under vacuum, giving 3 as an orange solid (72 mg, 76% yield). The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum suggested that the product was contaminated

Protonation of Nickel PNP Pincer Complexes
with an Acid
Under an argon atmosphere, a neutral nickel
pincer complex (1–4, 0.010 or 0.020
mmol) was dissolved
in ∼0.5 mL of C6D6 and placed in a J.
Young NMR tube. To the solution was added an appropriate amount of
acid (HCl as a 2.0 M solution in Et2O, HBF4·Et2O, H2O, or MeOH), as described in the Results and Discussion section. The progress of
the reaction was monitored by 1H and 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy.
