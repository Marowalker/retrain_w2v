Tight
reservoirs, as an important alternative for conventional
energy resources, have been successfully exploited with the aid of
hydraulic fracturing technologies. Because of the inherent ultralow
permeability and porosity, tight oil reservoirs generally suffer from
the effects of stress sensitivity. Both hydraulic fractures with complex
geometries and a high-permeability area known as stimulated reservoir
volume (SRV) may be generated by the massive hydraulic fracturing
operations. All these bring huge challenges in transient pressure
analysis of tight reservoirs. Up till now, although many research
studies have been carried out on the transient pressure analysis of
volume-fractured horizontal wells in tight reservoirs, unfortunately,
there is still a lack of research studies that have taken stress sensitivity,
complex fracture networks, and the SRV into consideration, simultaneously.
To fill up this gap, this paper first idealizes the reservoir after
hydraulic fracturing as two radial composite regions, that is, the
unstimulated outer region and the inner SRV. The stress sensitivity
is characterized by the variable permeability depending on the pore
pressure. A linear source with consideration of the stress sensitivity
in the composite reservoir is obtained by the perturbation technique,
Laplace transformation, and the flow coupling of two regions. Second,
the complex fracture networks are discretized into segments to capture
their geometries. A semi-analytical model is finally established and
validated by the comparison with previous models. On the basis of
our model, six flow stages of volume-fractured horizontal well are
identified and special features of each regime are analyzed. The stress
sensitivity has a great impact on the later stage of production. The
mobility ratio and the SRV radius mainly affect SRV pseudo-steady-state
flow period and interporosity flow period in the outer region. Fracture
number mainly affects the linear flow in the SRV. Fracture geometries
mainly affect linear flow and interporosity flow in the SRV. This
study has some significance for well test interpretation and production
performance analysis of tight reservoirs.

1 Introduction
During the oil production,
the decrease of formation pressure can
result in an increase of effective stress and the reduction of reservoir
properties, especially the permeability. This phenomenon known as
stress sensitivity will be more obvious in the tight reservoirs. Massive
hydraulic fracturing along with the horizontal well drilling is an
effective way to exploit the tight reservoirs, which not only can
form highly flowing channels but also can generate stimulated reservoir
volume (SRV).1 Because of the complex in
situ stress and fracturing operations, it can be observed from the
microseismogram that hydraulic fractures might be in arbitrary direction
and there might be an approximately circular stimulated region in
vicinity of the well as illustrated in Figure 1.

So far, lots of experimental techniques and theoretical methods
on the stress-sensitive media have been presented, given out important
parameters and models to describe the stress-sensitive effect.2−11 Fatt and Davis,6 Fatt,7 and Gray and Fatt8 studied the
effect of stress sensitivity on permeability and porosity via experimental
study for typical rocks under tri-axial stress state and found that
porosity is less sensitive to pressure drop compared with permeability
under reservoir conditions. Vairogs and Rhoades9 performed more detailed stress-sensitive experiments on
rock samples with different initial permeability and concluded that
there is greater degree of permeability reduction under low-permeability
conditions. Pedrosa10 introduced the permeability
modulus to establish an equation about the relationship between the
permeability and the pressure drop. Kilmer et al.11 and Han et al.12 carried out
research studies on stress sensitivity in tight reservoirs by using
indoor experimental measures and provided the relational expression
for the various permeabilities and the effective pressure. All above
fundamental research results provided powerful tools to study the
effect of stress sensitivity on transient pressure response and rate
performance of fractured horizontal well in tight reservoirs.

There has been a lot of attention to transient pressure response
and rate performance of fractured horizontal well in tight reservoirs.
Considering the fact that the withdrawal of fluids is mainly from
stimulated region, Ozkan et al.13 proposed
a “trilinear flow” model to study the transient pressure
behaviors of multistage fractured horizontal wells, with consideration
of a limited SRV region around the main fractures. Stalgorova and
Mattar14 extended the “trilinear
flow” model into a “five-zone” linear model,
taking both the SRV and unstimulated outer region into account. With
considering the SRV and stress sensitivity, Ji et al.15 and Wu et al.16 established
multilinear models to study the flow characteristics of fractured
horizontal wells in tight reservoirs. However, both the “trilinear
flow” and “five region” models rooted in an assumption
that the fractures are either perpendicular or parallel to the horizontal
wellbore, which indicates that the complex fracture geometry cannot
be reflected. Furthermore, in order to obtain the analytical solutions,
the flow in different regions is always assumed to be linear, some
important flow stages, especially, the radial flow regimes, cannot
be observed using these models.

To address these weaknesses,
many semi-analytical models without
such simplifications have been proposed by treating the reservoirs
after hydraulic fracturing as radial composite region. Zhao et al.1 simplified the SRV into a circular high-permeability
area and used the radial composite model to study the pressure-transient
response of fractured wells in unconventional reservoirs. Many useful
point source and linear source functions in radial composite regions
with different boundary conditions were first proposed in their work.
Although the flow forms of the fluids were no longer limited to be
linear, only transient pressure behaviors of the horizontal well with
fractures perpendicular to the wellbore was discussed. On the basis
of the source functions proposed in Zhao et al.,1 Jiang at al.17 further conducted
transient rate and pressure analysis for multistage fractured horizontal
well in tight oil reservoirs considering SRV, unfortunately, the fractures
were still limited to be perpendicular with the wellbore and stress
sensitivity was neglected as well in their work. Moreover, Zhao et
al.,18 Xu et al.19 combined the linear source function method and the perturbation
technique to take stress sensitivity into consideration when they
studied the transient pressure behaviors of horizontal wells, but
the complexity of the fracture networks was ignored. Jia et al.20 presented a comprehensive model combining finite-difference
and boundary-element method for the flow behaviors of the volume-fractured
horizontal well. Although the irregular geometry of the complex fracture
networks and internal and external boundaries were captured in their
model, the stress sensitivity was still neglected and the modeling
process was complex because of a coupling of various mathematical
methods. Considering the stress sensitivity of hydraulic fractures
and the reservoirs, Wang et al.,21 Chen
et al.22 proposed semi-analytical models
for transient flow behaviors of the fractured horizontal well with
complex fracture networks in homogeneous tight reservoirs, while ignoring
the property difference between the inner SRV and the outer unstimulated
region.

By the combination of the linear source function, perturbation
transformation, and Laplace transformation with the discrete fracture
model, the semi-analytical model proposed by this paper extends previous
work by a simultaneous consideration of the existence of SRV, complex
fracture networks after massive hydraulic fracturing, and the stress
sensitivity in the tight reservoirs. What is more, this paper discusses
the influence of relevant parameters on the transient response of
fractured horizontal wells in stress-sensitive tight reservoirs, including
stress sensitivity, mobility ratio of the SRV and the outer region,
SRV radius, storage coefficient and interporosity factor, fracture
number, and fracture geometries. Corresponding solutions can be useful
for fracturing design and well test interpretation in field practice.

2 Mathematical Model and Semi-Analytical Solution
2.1 Model Descriptions
Microseismic data
of a volume-fractured horizontal well with SRV is shown in Figure 1, and the corresponding
simplified physical model is shown in Figure 2. The whole reservoir after massive fracturing
can be divided into two circle zones with different properties. Specially,
the inner zone is the SRV, while the outer zone is the unstimulated
region. Other basic assumptions are as follows:(1) Inner SRV is idealized
as dual porosity
media to consider the small-scale fractures included the induced fractures
and the pre-existing natural fractures. The outer region is treated
as dual porosity media because tight oil reservoirs generally contain
a certain number of natural fractures.

(2) The complex fracture networks in the
SRV consist of hydraulic fractures in arbitrary direction.

(3) Only the stress sensitivity
of permeability
in the SRV and outer region is taken into consideration, while the
porosity is assumed to be constant during the production.

(4) The fluid in the whole
reservoirs
is simplified to be single phase and micro compressible, and the seepage
of the fluid follows Darcy’s Law.

(5) All hydraulic fractures are vertical
and fully penetrate the formation, so the flow pattern in this work
is simplified into plane radial flow, ignoring the influence of gravity
and capillary force.

(6) Hydraulic fractures and the wellbore
have infinite conductivity,23 and the well
is produced at a constant rate and the fluids flow toward the wellbore
only via the complex networks consisting of hydraulic fractures.

with SRV.

2.2 Mathematical
Model for the Radial Composite
System
According to Pedrosa,10 the pressure-dependent permeability could be expressed as an exponential
function of pore pressure, which has 1  

When the stress sensitivity of natural
fractures is considered, the uniform governing equations of natural
fractures and matrix can be obtained as follows19,24 2  

In eq 1, kfi is the initial permeability of the fracture
system
in the reservoir, m2; γ is the permeability
modulus, which is determined by the property of rock geomechanics
and always in the range of 10–5 to 10–4 Pa–1; pi is the initial
reservoir pressure, Pa.

For the convenience and simplicity of
formula deducing, some dimensionless
parameters are introduced first.  

Based on the above dimensionless
variables, the transient flow
equation for the outer region can be expressed as follows.1 3  

The
corresponding outer boundary condition in dimensionless form
is 4  

The corresponding initial condition for the outer region in dimensionless
form is 5  

Transient flow
equation for the inner SRV can be expressed in dimensionless
form as follows 6  

The corresponding initial
condition for the SRV in dimensionless
form is 7  

The continuity
condition on the interface between the outer region
and the SRV in dimensionless form can be expressed as 8  

The source
function methods can be used to solve the abovementioned
partial differential equations.1,18 It is assumed that
there is a linear source fully penetrating the formation with a radius
of almost zero in the SRV, the withdrawal of the fluid for the linear
source is q̃, the instantaneous production
rate of time t is q(t). The schematic diagram of the linear source in radial composite
reservoir is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Schematic diagram of the linear source in the composite reservoir.

According to the characteristic of the Dirac delta
function δ(t), the internal boundary condition
of the instantaneous
linear source can be expressed as follows 9  

Equation 9 can be
simplified as 10  

Equations 3 and 6 are strongly nonlinear partial differential equations,
which are not convenient to be solved analytically. A perturbation
transformation proposed by Pedrosa10 can
be used to eliminate the nonlinearity. New dimensionless variables
ηjD related to the dimensionless
pressure are introduced as follows 11  

It can be induced that η1D and η2D satisfy the following partial differential equations 12   13  

Subjecting
to the boundary and the initial conditions, respectively,
we can get 14   15   16   17   18  

According to the simplified method proposed by Pedrosa,10 because the dimensionless permeability modulus
γD is usually a small value, ηjD can be expanded as a power series in the parameter
γD. 19   20  

By substituting eqs 19 and 20 into eqs 12 and 13, we can get
a sequence of linear problems that can be solved for ηjD0, ηjD1, and so
on. According to Yeung et al.,25 the zero-order
approximation ηjD0 was accurate
enough for pressure analysis.

Following the previous works of
Wang et al.21 Liu et al.26 the zero-order
perturbation solutions for eqs 12 and 13 can be expressed as 21   22  

Accordingly, the boundary
and the initial conditions become 23   24   25   26  

The
general solutions of partial differential eqs 21 and 22 can
be obtained by Laplace transformation. 27   28   29  Here, s is the Laplace variables, Iv(x), Kv(x), (v = 0, 1) are the v-order first and second
modified Bessel functions, respectively; A1, B1, A2,
and B2 are the constant coefficients of
the general solution determined by the internal and outer boundary
conditions.

Taking Laplace transformation of the internal boundary
condition 23, we can get 30  

As , then B1 = q̅D. With boundary condition given in eq 26, we can get   , as , then A2 =
0.

With the continuity conditions on the interface between the
outer
region and the SRV, that is, eq 24 and 25, we can get 31   32  

As B1 = q̅D, then the only unknowns
of eqs 31 and 32 are A1 and B2. As B1 = q̅D, then
the only unknowns of eqs 31 and 32 are A1 and B2, and we can solve the linear
equation system represented by eqs 31 and 32 to obtain A1 and B2, simultaneously.

We first take ratios of the two sides of eqs 31 and 32 to eliminateB2. 33  

Then we can get 34   35  

Finally, by substituting eq 34 into eq 27,
we can get 36  where  

Make , the pressure distribution caused
by a
linear source is given by 37  

Equation 37 is
a
3D linear source solution for the two-zone composite reservoir considering
the stress-sensitive effects of the reservoir.

2.3 Solutions
for the Complex Fracture Networks
The 3D linear source fully
penetrating the formation can be simplified
as the point source in the X–Y plane.20 Assuming that the dimensionless
coordinate of the point source location is (xlD, ylD) in the X–Y plane, then the dimensionless pressure
at the dimensionless coordinate point (xD, yD) caused by the point source can
be written in a more general form17 38  

Following the methods proposed by Jia
et al.20 for complex fracture networks
in the homogeneous reservoirs, in order to capture the complex geometries
of fractures. The complex fracture networks should first be divided
into segments in different directions as shown in Figure 4. Each segment can be treated
as a uniform flux plane source with the arbitrary angle as shown in Figure 5. As the fractures
fully penetrate the formation, according to Jia et al.,20 the 3D flow problems in the formation can be
simplified into 2D problems as shown in Figure 6.

Figure 4 Diagram of the discrete element for fractures
with complex geometry.

Figure 5 Diagram of the fracture
segment in arbitrary direction in radial
two-zone reservoirs.

Figure 6 Top view of the fracture
segment in the arbitrary direction in
radial two-zone reservoirs.

The coordinates of all the points along the fracture segment j in the X–Y can
be expressed as: (xDj + ρ cos θj, yDj + ρ sin θj), −ΔLDj/2 ≤ ρ ≤ ΔLDj/2. According to Zeng et al.,27 the dimensionless pressure drop at the midpoint
of fracture segment i caused by the fracture segment j can be obtained by integrating the linear source function
in eq 38 over the length
of the jth fracture segment, and the expression can
be as follows 39  where  q̅Dj is the dimensionless flux of the j-th fracture
segment, q̅D/ΔLDj represents the dimensionless flux
of unit length along the fracture segment j; θj is the angle between fracture segment j and the x-axis, (xDi, yDi) and (xDj, yDj) are the dimensionless coordinates
of the midpoint of fracture segments i, j, respectively. We can find that eq 39 contains the information of the reservoir and the
geometry properties of the hydraulic fractures.

As we can see,
the partial differential equations, eqs 21 and 22,
are both linear. Their zero-order perturbation solutions satisfy the
superposition principle, which indicates that the pressure response
in the reservoir caused by the fracture networks can be calculated
by utilizing the superposition of pressure response caused by each
fracture segment. We assume that all hydraulic fractures are divided
into N fracture segments totally, the discretization
methods of the complex fracture networks can be seen in Figure 4. According to the superposition
principle, the dimensionless pressure of the ith
fracture segment caused by the whole complex fracture networks can
be expressed as 40  

Because of the assumption
that the hydraulic fractures and the
wellbore have infinite conductivity, the pressure drop of the fracture
segments is the same and all equal to the dimensionless wellbore pressure
drop η̅wD. 41  

The constant production rate
boundary condition is given in the
Laplace domain 42  

Applying eq 41 to
all the segments of the complex fracture networks, we can get N equations correlating q̅D1, q̅D2, q̅D3, ...q̅DN, η̅wD. Combined with the constant production
rate condition given in eq 42, a total of N + 1 equations are obtained,
and the associated matrix form can be written as 43  

The zero-order perturbation solution of the bottom hole pressure
and dimensionless flux of each fracture segment in the Laplace space
can be obtained by solving the eq 43. Then, following the methods proposed by Van Everdingen
and Hurst28 and Mukherjee and Economides,29 the zero-order perturbation solution of the
bottom hole pressure in the Laplace space considering the wellbore
storage CD and the skin factor S is obtained 44  

Finally, by using
the numerical inversion methods proposed by Stehfest,30 the zero-order perturbation solution of the
bottom hole pressure in real space is obtained, and the real dimensionless
bottom hole pressure pwD can be obtained
by eq 11.

3 Model Verification
As mentioned above, previous models
have not taken the stress sensitivity,
complex fracture networks, and the SRV into consideration, simultaneously,
so some simplifications need to be imposed in order to validate our
model with the previous ones.

Zongxiao et al.31 have established a
pressure analysis model for multiple fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs)
in homogeneous and stress-sensitive reservoirs. Further analysis of
the proposed model in this work reveals that if we make the inner
SRV has the same physical properties with the outer region, the solution
for MFHWs in homogeneous and stress-sensitive reservoirs can be obtained.
To verify the correctness of our model, comparison is made with the
model proposed by Zongxiao et al.31 The
case is a fractured horizontal well with 5 fractures perpendicular
to wellbore in stress-sensitive tight oil reservoirs as shown in Figure 7. The other parameters
used for simulation are listed in Table 1.

Another case
presented here for model verification is for MFHWs
in tight gas reservoirs with SRV (Figure 8). Zhao et al.1 proposed a semi-analytical model for MFHWs in unconventional gas
reservoirs with SRV based on radial composite assumption. If the intersection
angle between wellbore and hydraulic fractures is set as 90°
and the stress sensitivity is neglected in this paper, the dimensionless
pressure solutions presented in this work will be the same with dimensionless
pseudo-pressure solutions for MFHWs in unconventional gas reservoirs
obtained by Zhao et al.1 The values of
parameters used for comparison can be found in the Table 1 of Zhao et al.1

Figure 8 Comparison between the proposed model and that in Zhao et al.1

As shown in Figures 7 and 8, there is a good agreement of transient
pressure response between our model and these two models, which indicates
the correctness of our model.

4 Results and Discussions
4.1 Transient Pressure Behavior Analysis
Typical pressure
response curves of a volume-fractured horizontal
well with complex fracture networks considering the influence of the
SRV and the stress sensitivity are shown in Figure 8. The fracture distribution and geometry
of the complex fracture networks can be seen in Figure 2. We take the reference length L as 100 m. The values of the relevant parameters used in our model
are as follows: M12 = 4, ω1 = 0.2, ω1 = 0.1, ω21 = 0.5, R1D = 10, γD = 0.05, CD = 0.001, S = 0.1. By analyzing
the log–log graphs of dimensionless wellbore hole pressure
(pwD) and its derivative (dpwD/dln(tD/CD)) versus dimensionless times, we find that approximately
six flow stages can be identified.

Stage I: wellbore storage
and skin effect flow. This is a relatively common flow stage. The
wellbore storage coefficient and the skin representing the flow choking
between the hydraulic fractures and the wellbore can be obtained by
analyzing the characteristic of pressure and pressure derivative cures
in this stage. The detailed explanation of this stage can be found
in Chen et al.,22 Agarwal et al.,32 and Kuchuk et al.33

Stage II: the formation linear flow in the inner SRV. In this
flow
regime, because of the high permeability of the complex fracture networks,
hydraulic fractures can be treated as linear sinks, and liquid enters
the hydraulic fractures in the directions perpendicular to the fracture
faces. The typical feature of this flow behavior is that a 1/2-slope
straight line (Figure 9) occurs on the dimensionless derivative pressure curve.1

Figure 9 Typical curves of pressure response for volume-fractured
horizontal
well in stress-sensitivity formation.

Stage III: inter-porosity flow between the fracture system and
the matrix system due to the dual porosity assumption in the SRV.
In this stage, fluid in the matrix system flows into the fracture
system. The fluid supply of the matrix system slows down the pressure
depletion evidently. The typical characteristic is that there is a
“recess” on the pressure derivative curves.

Stage
IV: pseudo-steady flow in the SRV. The stress sensitivity
begins to take effects in this regime; the pressure wave reaches the
boundary of the SRV. However, because of the lower permeability of
the unstimulated region, there is not enough fluid supply in the outer
region. The flow characteristic in this stage is essentially reflective
of boundary-dominated flow.34 This is mainly because of the pressure interference
between the fracture networks and the property difference between
the SRV and the outer region. The fracture networks and boundary of
the SRV dominates the pressure responses. The similar flow stage is
also discussed by Song and Economides,34 when they studied transient pressure behavior of a volume-fractured
horizontal well with a discrete fracture network.

Stage V: inter-porosity
flow between the fracture system and the
matrix system in the outer region. Because of the pre-existing natural
fractures in the tight oil reservoirs, when the pressure waves reach
the outer region, there are fluids fed from the matrix to the natural
fracture in the outer region. This stage is marked by a “concave”
on the pressure derivative curve. The effects of stress sensitivity
on the transient pressure response become evident in this stage.

Stage VI: pseudo-radial flow in the entire system. In this period,
fluid in outer region flows into SRV in the radial direction, the
outer-zone dominates the system. The stress sensitivity has strongly
affected the fluid flow in this flow regime. According to Zhao et
al.1 and Jiang et al.,17 the pressure derivative response will exhibit a horizontal
line with a value of M12/2 in the two-zone
composite reservoirs without stress sensitivity. However, because
of the stress sensitivity, the value of the dimensionless pressure
derivative in this stage is greater than M12/2.

It should be noted that characteristics of the above flow
stages
can be affected by various factors, such as the physical properties
of the SRV and the outer region, the stress sensitivity, the hydraulic
fracture distribution, and geometry in the SRV. In practice, not all
flow periods would appear on type curves in a single situation. Therefore,
effects of key variables on the typical curves need to be further
studied.

4.2 Sensitivity Analysis
In order to
further study the transient pressure behaviors of the volume-fractured
horizontal well with complex fracture networks in stress-sensitive
tight reservoirs, sensitivity analysis is conducted in this section
to analyze the effect of important parameters on the typical pressure
response curves.

4.2.1 Effect of Stress Sensitivity
Figure 10 shows
the effect
of stress sensitivity on the pressure transient curves. The values
of relevant parameters are listed as follows: L =
100 m, M12 = 4, ω21 =
0.5, R1D = 12, N = 36,
ω1 = 0.2, ω2 = 0.1, λ1 = 10–2, λ2 = 10–4, CD = 0.01, S = 0.1.
Three cases were studied in which the dimensionless permeability modulus
γD is equal to 0.03, 0.05, and 0.08, respectively
(seen from Figure 10). It can be seen from Figure 10 that as the dimensionless permeability modulus increases,
the dimensionless pressure and its derivative curves rise gradually,
and the stress sensitivity mainly affects the flow behaviors at the
middle and later stages. In stress-sensitive reservoirs, as the fluid
is produced, the gradual reduction of formation pressure will result
in a decrease of the permeability of the fracture system while a growing
of pressure depletion. When the dimensionless permeability modulus
increases to a certain value, the pressure derivative curve rises
up significantly in later periods, showing the characteristic of the
closed boundary.

Figure 10 Effect of permeability modulus on pressure and derivative
curves.

4.2.2 Effect
of the Mobility Ratio of the SRV
and the Outer Region
Transient pressure and pressure derivative
curves for different mobility ratio of the SRV and the outer region
are illustrated in Figure 11. The values of relevant parameters are listed as follows: L = 100 m, γD = 0.03, ω21 = 0.5, R1D = 12, ω1 = 0.2, ω2 = 0.1, λ1 = 10–2, λ2 = 10–4, CD = 0.001, S = 0.1, while the mobility
ratio of the SRV and the outer region, M12 is 2, 4, 8, individually. It can be seen from Figure 11 that the initial mobility
ratio, M12, has great influence on the
flow behaviors of the middle to later time, including pseudo-steady-state
flow in the SRV, outer-region interporosity flow, and pseudo-radial
flow periods. As M12 decreases, the duration
of SRV pseudo-steady-state flow period will be shortened and the starting
time of the interporosity flow period in the outer region will be
advanced. It is mainly because the mobility ratio determines flow
capacity contrast of the SRV and outer zone. A larger M12 indicates a lower flow capacity of the outer zone and
a larger flow capacity contrast between the SRV and the outer region.
Therefore, the pressure and derivative response-associated outer zone
will surely enlarge; the curves of the transient response will rise
in interporosity flow and pseudo-radial flow periods in the outer
zone.

Figure 11 Effect of mobility ratio of the SRV and the outer region on pressure
and derivative curves.

4.2.3 Effect
of SRV Radius
Figure 12 illustrates the
effect of SRV radius on the transient behaviors. The values of relevant
parameters are listed as follows: L = 100 m, M12 = 4, ω21 = 0.5, γD = 0.05, R1D = 12, ω1 = 0.2, ω2 = 0.1, λ1 = 10–2, λ2 = 10–4, CD = 0.001, S = 0.1, and the
dimensionless SRV radius R1D is 8, 12,
and 15, respectively (Figure 12). It can be seen from Figure 12 that the radius of the SRV can affect all
the flow stages after the interporosity flow periods. The larger SRV
radius has (1) a later end of interporosity flow in the SRV; (2) a
postponed beginning of pseudo-steady flow in the SRV; and (3) the
lower values of dimensionless pressure and its derivatives in outer-zone
pseudo-radial flow periods. All these phenomena might provide useful
information to identify the sizes of SRV after massive hydraulic fracturing. Figure 12 also shows that
the larger the SRV radius, the smaller the dimensionless pressure
and its derivatives. Smaller dimensionless pressure indicates lower
pressure depletion in the formation, which is beneficial to obtain
a high production rate.

curves.

4.2.4 Effect
of Storage Ratio and InterPorosity
Factor
Figures 13 and 14 show the effect of storage
ratio ω1 and interporosity λ1 of
the SRV on the transient behavior. The values of the parameters related
to the Figure 13 are
listed as follows: L = 100 m, M12 = 2, ω21 = 0.5, γD = 0.05, R1D = 12, ω2 = 0.1, λ1 = 10–2, λ2 = 10–4, CD = 0.001, S = 0.1,
and the values of ω1 for comparison are 0.05, 0.1,
and 0.2, individually. The values of the parameters associated with Figure 14 are listed as
follows: L = 100 m, M12 = 2, ω21 = 0.5, γD = 0.05, R1D = 12, ω1 = 0.2, ω2 = 0.1, λ2 = 10–4, CD = 0.001, S = 0.1, and the
values of λ1 for comparison are 10–1, 10–2, and 10–3, individually. Figures 13 and 14 show that ω1 and λ1 mainly affect the degree and time of interporosity flow from
matrix to induced fractures system in the SRV, respectively. Smaller
ω1 indicates greater contrast of the storage capacity
between induced fractures system and matrix, the “concave”
which reflects the interporosity flow becomes more obvious. λ1 reflects the ability of the fluid to flow from the matrix
to the induced fractures system in the SRV.35 The larger the λ1 is, the earlier the interporosity
flow will happen. The larger ω1 and λ1 usually means better degree of hydraulic fracturing, which is beneficial
to the production.

Figures 15 and 16 show the
effects of storage ratio ω2 and interporosity λ2 of the outer region
on the transient behavior. The values of the parameters related to
the Figure 15 are
listed as follows: L = 100 m, M12 = 2, ω21 = 0.5, γD = 0.03, R1D = 12, ω1 = 0.2, λ1 = 10–2, λ2 = 10–4, CD = 0.001, S = 0.1,
the values of ω2 for comparison are 0.01, 0.05, and
0.1, individually. The values of the parameters associated with Figure 16 are listed as
follows: L = 100 m, M12 = 2, ω21 = 0.5, γD = 0.03, R1D = 12, ω1 = 0.2, ω2 = 0.1, λ1 = 10–2, CD = 0.001, S = 0.1, the values
of λ2 for comparison are 10–4,
10–5, and 10–6, individually. Figure 15 shows storage
ratio ω2 in the outer region, which mainly affects
the interporosity flow and pseudo-radial flow periods in the outer
region, as the increase of ω2, dimensionless pressure
and its derivatives will be lower, the depth of the “recess”
on the pressure derivative curves will be shallower. Figure 15 shows that the interporosity
flow factor λ2 mainly affects beginning time of interporosity
flow from natural fracture system to matrix system in the outer region,
the larger the λ2, the faster the transition flow
(mass exchange) between matrix system and the natural fracture system,
the earlier the interporosity flow stage shows up.

4.2.5 Effect
of Fracture Number
Three
cases with different number of hydraulic fractures shown in Figure 17 are studied in
this section to identify the effect of fracture number on the transient
behaviors. The values of relevant parameters are listed as follows: L = 100 m, M12 = 4, R1D = 10, ω21 = 0.5, γD = 0.05, R1D = 12, ω1 = 0.2, ω2 = 0.1, λ1 = 10–2, λ2 = 10–4, CD = 0.001, S = 0.1. As shown
in Figure 17, fracture
number mainly affects the linear flow in the SRV, with the increasing
of the fracture numbers, the dimensionless pressure and its derivatives
will be lower because of the interference of adjacent fractures. More
hydraulic fractures mean higher permeability around the wellbore and
more contact area with the formation for well, as a result, the flow
resistance in the vicinity of the wellbore will be smaller, which
is beneficial to obtain high production rate.36,37

curves.

4.2.6 Effect
of Fracture Geometry of the Complex
Fracture Networks
Because of the irregular geological processes
and uncertainties caused by hydraulic fracturing operation, the geometries
of fracture networks are usually complex.22 Here, we also study the effect of fracture geometry on the transient
behaviors. Two cases with different fracture geometries, that is,
the orthogonal fracture networks and nonorthogonal fracture ones,
are studied in this subsection. The configurations of the two complex
fracture networks and the transient pressure and derivative curves
are illustrated in Figure 18. Both of two fracture networks have the same total fracture
length and fracture numbers. The values of relevant parameters are
listed as follows: L = 100 m, M12 = 4, R1D = 10, ω21 = 0.5, γD = 0.05, R1D = 12, ω1 = 0.2, ω2 = 0.1, λ1 = 10–2, λ2 = 10–4, CD = 0.001, S = 0.1.

Figure 18 Effect
of fracture geometries of complex fracture networks on pressure
and derivative curves.

As seen in Figure 18, the fracture
geometry mainly affects linear flow and interporosity
flow in the SRV. The nonorthogonal fracture networks have a smaller
dimensionless pressure than that of the orthogonal one in this stage,
illustrating that complex fracture geometry is beneficial for fluid
production. When other parameters are determined, the volume fractured
well with the nonorthogonal fracture network has a shorter linear
flow and an earlier beginning of the interporosity in the SRV, which
indicates an earlier pressure interference between the fractures.
These phenomena might be useful when we need to distinguish the nonorthogonal
fracture network from the orthogonal one.

5 Conclusions
A semi-analytical model is proposed for volume-fractured
horizontal
wells with SRV and complex fracture networks in tight oil reservoirs.
The transient pressure and pressure derivative curves are also established.
The principal contributions in this work are summarized as follows:[1]. By using
the perturbation technique
and Laplace transformation, a linear source with consideration of
stress sensitivity and SRV is obtained. The fracture networks are
divided into fracture segments to capture the complex geometries,
meanwhile, the pressure drop caused by the fracture segment in arbitrary
direction can be calculated by integrating the linear source along
these segments. The solution of transient pressure behaviors for the
volume-fractured horizontal well with SRV and complex fracture networks
in stress-sensitive tight reservoirs is finally obtained by the principle
of superposition.

[2]. Approximately, six transient behaviors
can be identified on the basis of the calculation results of our model:
the wellbore storage and skin effect flow, the formation linear flow
in the inner SRV, interporosity flow in the SRV, Pseudo-steady flow
in the SRV. Interporosity flow from the matrix to the natural fracture
in the outer region and the pseudo-radial flow in the entire system.
The stress sensitivity has a great impact on the later stage of production,
specifically pseudo-steady flow in the SRV, interporosity flow in
the outer region and the pseudo-radial flow in the entire system.

[3]. The mobility ratio of
the SRV and
the outer region mainly affect the duration of SRV pseudo-steady-state
flow period and the starting time of the interporosity flow period
in the outer region. The SRV radius can influence the ending time
of interporosity flow in the SRV, the beginning time of pseudo-steady
flow in the SRV and the values of dimensionless pressure and its derivatives
in outer-zone pseudo-radial flow periods.

[4]. Storage ratio and interporosity factor
of the SRV mainly affect the degree and time of interporosity flow
from the matrix system to induced fractures system in the SRV, respectively.
The larger storage ratio and interporosity factor of the SRV usually
means better degree of hydraulic fracturing, which is beneficial to
the production. Storage ratio and interporosity of the outer region
mainly influence the interporosity flow and pseudo-radial flow periods
in the outer region.

[5]. Fracture number mainly affects the
linear flow in the SRV. Fracture geometries mainly affect linear flow
and interporosity flow in the SRV. The nonorthogonal fracture networks
yield a smaller dimensionless pressure than the orthogonal one in
these stages. The volume-fractured well with nonorthogonal fracture
networks results a shorter linear flow and an earlier beginning of
the interporosity in the SRV, which might be useful when we need to
distinguish the nonorthogonal fracture network from the orthogonal
one.
