Few experimental studies on the CH
+ CO2 global reaction propose H, CO, and HCO as major products.
However, the reaction mechanisms behind this process have not yet
been elucidated. Moreover, some intriguing kinetic particularities
were noticed in these previous investigations. The advanced theoretical
study performed here shows that a CH insertion mechanism is capable
of explaining all the experimental data available. Hence, the strong
deviations from a traditional Arrhenius behavior ascribed to the rate-determining
elementary reaction (the CH insertion step) account for the kinetic
particularities observed experimentally. A change in the preferred
product channel as temperatures increase (from HCO + CO to H + 2CO)
is also predicted to occur due to the HCO decomposition, although
the CH depletion rates in typical conditions are not affected by this
additional step.

1 Introduction
Thermal decompositions of small hydrocarbons such as ethane or
methane are able to produce the methylidyne radical (CH) with high
efficiency.1 Moreover, the posterior reaction
of CH with other molecular compounds (for example, N2,
O2, and CO2) are fundamental for understanding
the combustion processes.1−3 However, the mechanisms for most
reactions involving CH have not been completely elucidated.3

Despite the importance of methylidyne for
combustion, to the best of our knowledge, there are only four experimental
studies reported about the kinetics of the gas phase reaction between
CH and carbon dioxide (CO2)1−4 1  Two main product channels are usually mentioned
for this reaction: one producing formyl (HCO) and carbon monoxide
(CO) and another providing H + 2CO. The first decomposition channel
is more exothermic than the second one at 298 K (−65.0 and
−49.2 kcal mol–1, respectively).1 However, since the forward reaction rates for reaction 1 were estimated by
means of CH depletion measurements, the relative importance of each
channel was not addressed.1−4

According to Butler et al.,2 the forward rate constant for reaction 1 is (1.9 ± 0.4) × 10–12 cm3 particle–1 s–1 at room temperature. This value is in agreement with the respective
measurements from Berman et al.,3 (1.8
± 0.1) × 10–12 cm3 particle–1 s–1, who also verified the increase
of reaction rate constants with temperature (between 297 and 670 K),
providing an Arrhenius’ activation energy of 0.69 ± 0.11
kcal mol–1.

More than a decade later, experimental
investigations done by Mehlmann et al.4 indicated no pressure dependence (between 5 and 80 Torr) for the
rate constant of reaction 1 at room temperature, with a value of (2.05 ± 0.15) × 10–12 cm3 particle–1 s–1. However, a more complicated temperature dependence
pattern emerged for such rate constants, that is, decreasing slightly
from 296 to 400 K and increasing more significantly between 500 and
873 K. Thereby, a preferential product channel change was proposed
by them to occur at temperatures around 500 K. Almost simultaneously,
Markus et al.1 performed experiments at
higher temperatures (2500–3500 K), finding an Arrhenius’
activation energy of 15.8 kcal mol–1. Hence, due
to the huge discrepancy with respect to the aforementioned activation
energy result from Berman et al.,3 Markus
et al.1 suggested a non-Arrhenius behavior
for the rate constants of reaction 1 along with the explanation already cogitated by Mehlmann
et al.4 Two probable routes have been conjectured
for this reaction: abstraction of an oxygen atom from CO2 by methylidyne and insertion of CH into a CO bond from carbon dioxide.2,3

Hence, inspired by these discussions, a thermochemical and
kinetic study concerning the 2  and 3  reactions were performed along temperatures from 50
to 4000 K. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical chemistry
investigation regarding the mechanism of reaction 2. The main goal of this work is to elucidate
the kinetic details of the reaction between CH and CO2 and
to verify whether a decisive explanation can be obtained for the particularities
noticed experimentally.

2 Results and Discussion
Two alternative pathways for the CH + CO2 ↔ HCO
+ CO reaction were found from UCCSD/cc-pVDZ and ROCCSD/cc-pVDZ calculations
(see Figure 1, plotted
with Molden 5.3).5 Each path is constituted
by three or four elementary steps, involving one precomplex, one postcomplex
(PoC1), four intermediate compounds (IM1, IM2, IM3, and IM4), and
six transition state (TS) structures (TSR1, TS12, TS23, TS3P, TS14,
and TS4P). Anyway, the CH + CO2 ↔ IM1 elementary
reaction (CH insertion step) is a common process for both paths. This
study also shows that the HCO ↔ H + CO reaction proceeds through
a single elementary step, so that the TS and postcomplex structures
are labeled as TSRP and PoC2, respectively (Figure 1). The ROCCSD method was used to verify whether
the small spin contamination signs detected in some structures (IM2,
IM3, TS23, TS3P, TS14, and TS4P) can lead to significant differences
in geometries or vibrational frequencies.

Figure 1 Stationary points of
the CH + CO2 ↔ HCO + CO and HCO ↔ H + CO
reactions as obtained at the UCCSD/cc-pVDZ level.

Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2 furnish equilibrium geometrical parameters encountered at the UCCSD/cc-pVDZ
and ROCCSD/cc-pVDZ levels for all stationary points exhibited in Figure 1. The largest deviations
with respect to experimental data of Lide6 for CH, CO2, HCO, and CO are around 2.5%. In addition,
the maximum discrepancies between results from UCCSD/cc-pVDZ and ROCCSD/cc-pVDZ
levels were 0.0096 Å for bond distances and 0.8° for bond
angles. However, this bond length difference refers to a significantly
elongated H–C bond in the TSRP structure (around 1.8 Å),
and the two largest remaining discrepancies are only 0.0061 Å
(TS4P) and 0.0031 Å (TS23).

In the case of scaled vibrational
frequencies of fundamental bands (see Supporting Information Tables S3 and S4), similar results are once more
obtained from UCCSD/cc-pVDZ and ROCCSD/cc-pVDZ calculations (maximum
discrepancies of 84.7 cm–1), with the largest deviation
of 6.3% with respect to experimental data.6−8

In summary,
the small spin contamination signs noticed in some structures do not
lead to significant differences in geometries and vibrational frequencies,
indicating the reliability of the standard UCCSD/cc-pVDZ treatment.

The best energy values relative to reactants (CH + CO2), which were achieved from the ROCCSD(T)/CBS//UCCSD/cc-pVDZ combined
treatment (ECBS plus scaled zero-point
corrections), are illustrated in Supporting Infomation Figure S1. One can notice that the three-step
mechanism to HCO + CO formation is less likely to occur, once the
forward IM1 ↔ IM4 process exhibits a barrier height of 51.6
kcal mol–1, whereas the largest barrier along the
four-step path is only 6.6 kcal mol–1 (IM3 →
HCO + CO process). This preferential trend is also observed for relative
enthalpies (see Supporting Information Table S5) and relative Gibbs free energies (see Supporting Information Table S6 and Figure 2) along all temperatures considered here
(from 50 to 4000 K). Therefore, the four-step path is predicted as
the most favorable route for HCO + CO formation.

Figure 2 Gibbs free energy profiles
(in kcal mol–1) relative to reactants (CH + CO2) for the stationary point structures of the CH + CO2 ↔ HCO + CO and HCO ↔ H + CO reactions, as calculated
at the ROCCSD(T)/CBS//UCCSD/cc-pVDZ level.

The CH + CO2 → HCO + CO reaction is fairly exothermic,
exhibiting an enthalpy change of −64.4 kcal mol–1 at 300 K (Table S5). This result is between
the reference values of −64.0 kcal mol–1 at
300 K9 and −64.9 kcal mol–1 at 298 K.10 Gibbs free energy changes
for this reaction are predicted as −66.2 and −78.8 kcal
mol–1 at 300 and 3500 K (Table S6), respectively. These results are again in excellent agreement
with the reference values of −65.8 and −77.8 kcal mol–1 at 300 and 3500 K, respectively,9 as well as with −66.5 kcal mol–1 at 298 K.10

The HCO → H
+ CO reaction is endothermic at all temperatures analyzed and presents
an enthalpy change of 15.8 kcal mol–1 at 300 K (Table S5), which is in great accordance with
the reference value of 15.4 kcal mol–1 at 298 K.10 Therefore, the CH + CO2 →
H + 2 CO reaction is exothermic by −48.6 kcal mol–1 at this same temperature (Table S5),
in excellent agreement with the literature value of −49.2 kcal
mol–1 at 298 K.1 As seen
by Gibbs free energies presented in Table S6, the HCO → H + CO reaction is nonspontaneous at low temperatures
and spontaneous at temperatures higher than 700 K. According to this
same table, the Gibbs free energy variation at 300 K, 9.5 kcal mol–1, is also in great accordance with the reference value
of 9.1 kcal mol–1 at 298 K.10

Rate constants obtained from the ICVT/SCT formalism are shown
in Table 1. Numerical
simulations (see the next section) demonstrate that the global rate
of the CH + CO2 → products reaction along several
temperatures (from CH depletion rates in typical conditions) is represented
by the same velocity law than the first forward elementary step, from
these reactants to IM1. Thus, the CH + CO2 → IM1
elementary process (CH insertion step) is proved to be the rate-determining
step for the CH + CO2 → products reaction along
all temperatures considered.

a Data in bold related to bimolecular steps are given
in units of cm3 particle–1 s–1.

Comparisons can be directly
done with the experimental data available. Hence, Berman et al.3 found rate constants for the reaction between
CH and CO2 of (1.8 ± 0.1)×10–12, (2.5 ± 0.4) × 10–12, and (3.5 ±
0.3) × 10–12 cm3 particle–1 s–1, respectively, at temperatures of 297, 480,
and 670 K. In turn, experimental values of (1.9 ± 0.4) ×
10–12 and (2.05 ± 0.15) × 10–12 cm3 particle–1 s–1 were measured, respectively, by Butler et al.2 at room temperature and by Mehlmann et al.4 at 296 K. Finally, the expression fitted by Markus et al.1 from experimental data resulted in rate constant
values of 1.3 × 10–11, 2.2 × 10–11, and 3.3 × 10–11 cm3 particle–1 s–1, respectively, at 2500, 3000,
and 3500 K. The rate constants presented in Table 1 for the CH + CO2 → IM1
step (2.4 × 10–12, 3.2 × 10–12, 4.4 × 10–12, 2.7 × 10–11, 3.7 × 10–11, and 4.9 × 10–11 cm3 particle–1 s–1 obtained, respectively, at 300, 500, 700, 2500, 3000, and 3500 K)
are in great agreement with the aforementioned data. The largest relative
discrepancy occurs at 2500 K, so that the calculated rate constant
is twice as large as the experimental result in this case.

Next,
Supporting Information Table S7 provides
traditional Arrhenius’ parameters (A = pre-exponential
factor and EARR = Arrhenius’ activation
energy) for all forward elementary steps discussed in this work. In
this table, the Arrhenius’ parameters found for the CH + CO2 → IM1 rate-determining step between 300 and 700 K
(A = 6.4 × 10–12 cm3 particle–1 s–1 and EARR = 0.64 kcal mol–1) are in excellent
accordance with the values of (5.7 ± 0.9) × 10–12 cm3 particle–1 s–1 and 0.69 ± 0.11 kcal mol–1, which were obtained
by Berman et al. from experimental measurements done between 297 and
670 K.3 This same elementary step furnished A = 2.1 × 10–10 cm3 particle–1 s–1 and EARR = 10.2 kcal mol–1 along 2500–3500
K, which are respectively in fair agreement with the experimental
values of 3.2 × 10–10 cm3 particle–1 s–1 and 15.8 kcal mol–1 encountered by Markus et al. along this same temperature range.1

From the results discussed before, one
can conclude that the discrepancies between activation energy values
obtained experimentally at low and high temperatures are readily explained
by strong temperature dependencies exhibited by the rate-determining
elementary process (CH + CO2 → IM1).

Table 2 presents the parameters
fitted for each elementary step according to the following modified
Arrhenius’ equation 4  where R is the ideal gas constant (in kcal mol–1 K–1), T is the
temperature, and β is a temperature dependence parameter. This
equation provides our recommended rate constant data. As expected,
the CH + CO2 → IM1 step shows an evident non-Arrhenius
behavior once the β parameter is 1.87 in this case, which agrees
with the proposal from Markus et al.1 regarding
rate constants of reaction 1.

b MAD means maximum absolute deviations (in %) found between
rate constants obtained from eq 4 and those presented in Table 1.

In addition,
a kinetic catalogue organized by Baulch et al.10 based on all experimental data available provides a modified
Arrhenius’ expression for reaction 1 given by 5  which was fitted from 296 to 3500
K. Thus, if eq 5 is transformed to assume the
same structure of eq 4, the parameters A = 5.83 × 10–13 cm3 particle–1 s–1, β = 1.51, and EARR = −0.72
kcal mol–1 will be obtained. These parameters reinforce,
once more, that the CH + CO2 → IM1 reaction is the
rate-determining step of the global reaction 1 since all data contained in Table 2 for this elementary step (A = 4.21 × 10–13 cm3 particle–1 s–1, β = 1.87, and EARR = −1.04 kcal mol–1) are in excellent accordance with those presented by Baulch et al.10

Finally, temporal evolution simulations
were performed for the concentrations of stable species. To this end,
we considered initial concentrations of 1.0 × 1012 and 1.0 × 1016 particle cm–3 for
CH and CO2, respectively, whereas the initial concentrations
for the other molecules were taken as zero. The initial concentrations
of reactants were chosen based on the representative values used by
experimentalists.1−4 All forward and reverse rate constants showed in Table 1 were taken into consideration
at temperatures of 200, 300, 500, 700, 2500, and 3500 K.

Figure 3 illustrates the
results from these simulations, whereas the Supporting Information Table S8 contains equilibrium concentrations
and time to achieve this condition. One can notice that CH and CO2 reach a chemical equilibrium considerably faster than HCO,
CO, and H at 200 and 300 K, indicating a slow HCO decomposition into
CO and H in comparison with the CH insertion step. On the other hand,
the simulations performed show that the HCO decomposition is much
faster than the CH insertion step at temperatures higher than 700
K.

cm–3, respectively, for CH and CO2.

Chemical equilibrium concentrations for CH, IM1,
IM2, IM3, and IM4 are almost negligible, reaching a maximum of ∼1
× 10–4 particle cm–3 at 300
K. Hence, these simulations point out HCO and CO concentrations of
1.0 × 1012 particle cm–3 at the
chemical equilibrium at 200 K, whereas the concentration of H is about
105 times smaller. On the other hand, CO and H concentrations
at the chemical equilibrium from 500 to 3500 K are, respectively,
2.0 × 1012 and 1.0 × 1012 particle
cm–3, while the HCO concentration decays from ∼2
× 107 to ∼5 × 101 particle
cm–3 at this temperature range.

The previous
results show that HCO and CO are the major products from the reaction
between CH and CO2 at lower temperatures, while the H +
2 CO products predominate from room temperature upwards. These findings
are in some agreement with those of Mehlmann et al.4 and Markus et al.1 However,
these authors proposed a preferential product channel change as a
possible explanation for the complicated behavior of rate constants
for reaction 1 along
temperature changes.1,3 Nevertheless, our investigation
shows that the CH depletion rates from the global CH + CO2 → products reaction are dictated by the rate-determining
step (CH + CO2 → IM1) along all temperatures considered
(for CH concentrations larger than 1 × 105 particle
cm–3, approximately).

3 Conclusions
Two alternative insertion mechanisms (the CH molecule is inserted
into one CO bond of carbon dioxide) were found for the CH + CO2 ↔ HCO + CO reaction. These alternative routes share
the same initial elementary reaction, and the four-step pathway is
much faster than the three-step one. According to this preferential
mechanism, the global rate for the CH + CO2 → products
process, from CH depletion measurements, follows the rate law ascribed
to the first forward elementary reaction (CH + CO2 →
IM1), which means the CH insertion step is the rate-determining step.

The rate constants and Arrhenius’ parameters obtained here
for the aforementioned elementary process are in excellent agreement
with all experimental measurements available in the literature for
the global reaction. The strong temperature dependence noticed for
the rate-determining step is the cause for the huge discrepancy observed
in the activation energy values obtained experimentally at low and
high temperatures.

Finally, a change in the preferred product
channel for the CH + CO2 reaction along temperature was
also verified, so that the HCO + CO products predominate at lower
temperatures, whereas the H + 2 CO channel becomes preferential from
300 K upward. However, this second channel requires only an additional
step (HCO → H + CO) occurring soon after the formation of HCO.
Anyway, the CH + CO2 → IM1 elementary reaction remains
the rate-determining step for the CH depletion rates from the global
process CH + CO2 → products.

4 Methodology
The Gaussian 0911 program was employed
for the electronic structure calculations. The unrestricted and restricted
open-shell coupled cluster treatments with single and double excitations
(CCSD) along with the cc-pVDZ basis set (UCCSD/cc-pVDZ and ROCCSD/cc-pVDZ,
respectively) were used to investigate the potential energy surfaces.
Accurate equilibrium geometries were obtained from very tight convergence
criteria. The T1 diagnostic12,13 was analyzed to guarantee the reliability of the single reference
methodology used. Only TS14 (0.045 for UCCSD and 0.065 for ROCCSD)
and TS4P (0.056 for UCCSD and 0.034 for ROCCSD) presented T1 results slightly above the recommended threshold
value of 0.04513 for doublets, but as these
structures refer to the nonpreferential route for the CH + CO2 → HCO + CO reaction, this fact is not worthy of attention.
All transition state (TS) structures found here are genuine, presenting
only one imaginary frequency. Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC)14,15 calculations assured the direct connection of TSs with their corresponding
reactant(s) and product(s). A vibrational scaling factor16 of 0.947 was adopted to consider anharmonic
corrections for vibrational frequencies and, consequently, for zero-point
energies (ε0) and thermal corrections to enthalpies
and Gibbs free energies. However, IRC calculations and the posterior
rate constant determinations cannot be carried out with the ROCCSD/cc-pVDZ
level due to Gaussian 09 limitations. Therefore, the UCCSD/cc-pVDZ
treatment is used after validation with ROCCSD/cc-pVDZ results.

The treatment of electronic energies for stationary points was improved
from a Complete Basis Set (CBS) extrapolation17 6  where E4 and E5 are the electronic energies achieved
from single-point calculations including also perturbative corrections
for triple excitations done, respectively, with cc-pVQZ and cc-pV5Z
basis sets (ROCCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ and ROCCSD(T)/cc-pV5Z), which were done
at UCCSD/cc-pVDZ optimized geometries. Hence, considering temperatures
from 50 to 4000 K and a standard pressure of 1 atm, enthalpies and
Gibbs free energies are evaluated from a sum of ECBS with scaled values of ε0 and thermal
corrections. This same combined treatment (ROCCSD(T)/CBS//UCCSD/cc-pVDZ)
was employed to obtain rate constants.

We determined forward
(kf) and reverse (kr) high pressure limit rate constants from the Improved Canonical
Variational Transition State Theory (ICVT)18 together with the Small-Curvature Tunneling (SCT)19 approximation. These ICVT/SCT rate constants were estimated
by using the Polyrate20 package and the
Gaussrate21 interface, which required around
seven thousand calculations to build the minimal energy path and the
vibrational adiabatic ground-state potential curve for all elementary
processes. This huge number of calculations turns the use of larger
basis set than cc-pVDZ unviable to this end considering our actual
computational resources. Besides, a factor of 2, due to the rotational
symmetry number22 of CO2, as
well as the value of 27.95 cm–1,23 from the spin–orbit splitting of the X2Π state of CH, were considered to refine kf and kr results.

Finally,
DLSODE24 (based on GEAR25 subroutine) was used to simulate the evolution of molecular
concentrations along time.
