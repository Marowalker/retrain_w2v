Methane, which has a high energy
storage density and is safely
stored and transported in our existing infrastructure, can be produced
through conversion of the undesired energy carrier H2 with
CO2. Methane production with standard transition-metal
catalysts requires high-temperature activation (300–500 °C).
Alternatively, semiconductor metal oxide photocatalysts can be used,
but they require high-intensity UV light. Here, we report a Ru metal
catalyst that facilitates methanation below 250 °C using sunlight
as an energy source. Although at low solar intensity (1 sun) the activity
of the Ru catalyst is mainly attributed to thermal effects, we identified
a large nonthermal contribution at slightly elevated intensities (5.7
and 8.5 sun) resulting in a high photon-to-methane efficiency of up
to 55% over the whole solar spectrum. We attribute the excellent sunlight-harvesting
ability of the catalyst and the high photon-to-methane efficiency
to its UV–vis–NIR plasmonic absorption. Our highly efficient
conversion of H2 to methane is a promising technology to
simultaneously accelerate the energy transition and reduce CO2 emissions.

Introduction
To secure our future
energy supply,1 it will be necessary to
build up storage capacities for extremely
large amounts of energy. Such storage buffers are required for temporal
matching of demand and supply as the energy generated from renewable
sources,2 e.g., solar and wind, inherently
fluctuates. To limit land use, energy should be stored in materials
with a high gravimetric storage density, i.e., chemical bonds.3 Hydrogen4 (H2) seems attractive due to its high gravimetric storage density and
the mature technology for its production through electrolysis. However,
large-scale application of H2 is problematic due to safety
issues associated with large quantity storage, incompatibility with
current gas distribution infrastructure, and high costs to construct
or upgrade infrastructure. By transforming the H–H bond from
green H2 into C–H bonds of methane (CH4),5 it is possible to produce a green
energy carrier with high gravimetric storage density that is actually
currently used in our infrastructure. Carbon dioxide (CO2) serves as a carbon source for this methanation and, therefore,
this process can help to reduce CO2 emitted from point
sources.

For this methanation to be sustainable as a whole,
it is necessary
that all energy required to drive the process directly originates
from sunlight, i.e., no transformation of light into electricity (which
inherently leads to energy losses) is needed. This process would require improvements
over the current state-of-the-art Sabatier process,6 which requires high temperatures (300–500 °C),
and the use of semiconductor photocatalysts,7 which can harvest only the short wavelength part of the solar spectrum
and would thus require highly concentrated UV light (Figure 1).

Figure 1 State-of-the-art methanation,
and our low-temperature photomethanation
reaction with broad-band absorption of sunlight.

Plasmonic nanomaterials, e.g., metallic nanoparticles of
Au, Ag,
and Al, can transform light into heat and hot charge carriers,8 which opens up multiple pathways for promoting
catalytic processes. Photoinduced increase of the temperature of plasmonic
nanoparticle catalysts may provide heat to nearby reactants, resulting,
e.g., in increased reaction rates. Alternatively, hot electrons may
be generated and transferred to a reactant in close proximity to the
particle surface, which can influence, e.g., rate or selectivity of
catalytic processes. Third, the photon rate seen by adjacent reactants
may be increased because of enhancement of the optical nearfield adjacent
to the nanoparticle. A recent review by Baffou and Quidant provides
an overview of the main mechanisms involved in plasmon catalysis.8 Depending on their type of metal, size, and shape,
they can harvest a particular part of the sunlight spectrum.9 Combining plasmonic nanoparticles with several
sizes and shapes within a single catalyst could be exploited to harvest
the energy from the entire solar spectrum reaching the earth’s
surface. Recently, Corma, García, and co-workers10 used a combination of a metallic and a semiconductor
catalyst, i.e., Ni and NiO nanoparticles, for photomethanation with
concentrated light at 150 °C. This study does not differentiate
between the contribution of the metallic and semiconductor catalyst
and is not carried out with terrestrial sunlight. Ye and co-workers11 screened a variety of group VIIIb nanoparticles,
including Ru and Rh, for photomethanation using highly concentrated
light to heat the catalyst to approximately 300 °C (bulk photothermal
heating) for carrying out the state-of-art Sabatier process. Liu and
co-workers proposed a technique to distinguish between thermal and
nonthermal contributions in plasmon catalysis.12 For photomethanation of CO2 using titania-supported
Rh nanospheres as a catalyst, they determined an apparent quantum
efficiency of 46% for high-intensity UV light (λ = 365 nm, photon
flux Φ = 2.7 W cm–2) and a catalyst temperature
of 350 °C. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest
reported apparent quantum efficiency to date for plasmon-catalyzed
photomethanation of CO2. An extensive overview of the literature
on photomethanation processes with correspondingly reported catalytic
activities has been added to the Supporting Information (SI, Table S1). Furthermore, Liu and co-workers demonstrated
that illumination of Rh nanoparticle catalysts with UV light can be
applied to tune the selectivity in the catalytic hydrogenation of
CO2, toward either CH4 or CO.13

Here, we report a rod-shaped Ru metal catalyst on
Al2O3 that facilitates photomethanation. We
managed to promote
the methanation using sunlight as a sole energy source. Furthermore,
we demonstrate a large nonthermal contribution of sunlight to the
reaction, resulting in a high photon-to-methane (PTM) efficiency of
up to 55%. We attribute the excellent sunlight-harvesting ability
of our catalyst and the high photon-to-methane efficiency to its plasmon
resonance in the UV–vis–NIR, which relates to the geometry
of the catalyst and, thus, provides valuable guidelines for catalyst
design. Our highly efficient conversion of H2 to methane
is a promising technology to simultaneously accelerate the energy
transition and reduce CO2 emissions.

Results and Discussion
In search of a catalyst that consists of plasmonic metallic particles
with a variety of shapes and sizes so that it can harvest a large
part of the solar energy, we prepared RuO2 nanocrystals
supported on γ-Al2O3 (6.0 wt % Ru) via
a wet impregnation technique (Experimental Section). This material was used as a precatalyst for the methanation at
1 sun light intensity (1 kW m–2) and 150 °C
reactor temperature (Experimental Section),
which leads only to formation of CH4 and H2O
as products. After 2 h, 174 ± 9 mmol CH4 gRu–1 was obtained under these conditions, whereas
only a fraction of this amount (51 mmol CH4 gRu–1) was produced without illumination at the same
reactor temperature. Thus, the catalyst is substantially more active
under illumination with terrestrial sunlight when compared to dark.

To investigate the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions,
we used the catalyst in seven sequential 30 min reactions at 1 sun
and 150 °C (Figure 2b). Reproducibly, the first two runs gave a lower yield of methane
(first run 36 ± 2 mmol CH4 gRu–1) than the runs 3–7 (57 ± 2 mmol CH4 gRu–1), indicating that the RuO2 precatalyst is reduced in situ to the metallic Ru catalyst during
the first reaction runs. No catalyst deactivation was observed from
the third to the seventh run. Preactivation of the RuO2 precatalyst with H2 for 2 h at 250 °C allowed us
to obtain a more active Ru catalyst. Use of this catalyst for the
methanation reaction at 150 °C and 1 sun illumination resulted
in a 1.6-fold increase in yield after a 1 h reaction time (135 mmol
CH4 gRu–1, Figure 2c) versus the use of the RuO2 precatalyst (85 mmol CH4 gRu–1, Figure 2a). Again,
only a fraction of methane was produced without illumination at the
same reactor temperature (53 mmol CH4 gRu–1 in 1 h, Figure 2c).

using a nonactivated catalyst, (b) seven sequential solar methanation
runs using a nonactivated catalyst, and (c) solar methanation (○)
vs methanation in dark (•) using an activated catalyst. Reaction
conditions: reaction mixture of H2/CO2/N2 (5:1:1) at 3.5 bar pressure, 300 mg of either RuO2 precatalyst or the preactivated Ru catalyst, reactor temperature
150 °C, 1 sun (or 0 sun) light intensity.

To differentiate between thermal and nonthermal effects contributing
to the sunlight-fueled methanation, we performed kinetic studies using
the activated Ru catalyst and different combinations of reactor temperature
(between 25 and 190 °C) and sunlight intensity (dark, 1, 5.7,
8.5 sun). In all experiments, the catalyst temperature was monitored
by placing a thermocouple directly under the catalyst bed (SI, Figure S3). In a comparative experiment using
an infrared camera, we confirmed the correctness of the catalyst temperature
determined with the thermocouple (SI, Figure S6). As depicted in Figure 3a, the catalyst temperature increases substantially upon illumination.

Figure 3 (a) Measured
catalyst temperatures upon illumination (•:
0 sun; green box solid: 1 sun; blue diamond solid: 5.7 sun; red triangle
up solid: 8.5 sun) and (b) Arrhenius plot displaying observed reaction
rates for the methanation at various reactor temperatures and light
intensities (•: 0 sun; green box solid: 1 sun; blue diamond
solid: 5.7 sun; red triangle up solid: 8.5 sun). Reaction conditions:
reaction mixture of H2/CO2/N2 (5:1:1)
at 3.5 bar pressure, 300 mg of the preactivated Ru catalyst, reactor
temperatures: 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 or 175 °C; light intensities:
dark, 1, 5.7 or 8.5 sun.

For the experiment performed at Treactor = 150 °C and 1 sun solar intensity, the catalyst temperature Tcat increased to 164 °C. Higher solar intensities
resulted in a further increase in the catalyst temperature, with a
maximum of 231 °C obtained for Treactor = 150 °C and 8.5 sun. To differentiate between thermal and
nonthermal contributions of sunlight illumination, we studied the
reaction kinetics for different combinations of reactor temperature
(Treactor between 25 and 190 °C)
and sunlight intensity (dark, 1, 5.7, 8.5 sun) and compared the reaction
rates to those obtained in dark at the same catalyst temperature.
The results of this study are depicted in the Arrhenius plot (Figure 3b). The results clearly
demonstrate that at the standard solar intensity of 1 sun and catalyst
temperatures up to 189 °C the contribution of illumination with
sunlight is largely thermal since the obtained reaction rates are
nearly identical to those obtained in dark for the same catalyst temperature.
At solar intensities of 5.7 and 8.5 sun, the contribution is largely
thermal up to a catalyst temperature of approximately 200 °C.
At higher catalyst temperatures of 212 °C (Treactor = 150 °C + 5.7 sun), 221 °C (Treactor = 125 °C + 8.5 sun), and 231 °C
(Treactor = 150 °C + 8.5 sun), respectively,
the reaction rates are 1.93, 2.12, and 2.73 times higher than the
calculated rate obtained in dark at the same catalyst temperature.
From the kinetics study, we calculated a photon-to-methane (PTM) efficiency
to quantify the nonthermal contribution of solar illumination as follows  with kl = reaction
rate upon illumination, kd = reaction
rate in dark at the same catalyst temperature as in the illumination
reaction, Φ = photon flux, and A = illuminated
area. This PTM carries the same definition as the apparent quantum
efficiency introduced by Liu and co-workers.12 Both terms represent the ratio of the nonthermal share of the reaction
rate to the rate of incident photons, and reported values are therefore
directly comparable. We decided to introduce the term “photon-to-methane
efficiency” because it accurately represents the efficiency
of solar methanation reactions as the ratio of CH4 molecules
produced to incident photons. We consider the term “quantum
efficiency” confusing in this respect since it is defined as
the ratio of photocurrent versus the rate of incident photons to characterize
optoelectronic devices. Hence, it describes the share of energy from
(sun)light that is converted to electrical energy. In the Sabatier
process, solar energy is not converted to chemical energy since the
reaction is exothermic.

The PTMs obtained for the reactions
at Treactor = 150 °C + 5.7 sun (Tcat = 212
°C), Treactor = 125 °C + 8.5
sun (Tcat = 221 °C), and Treactor = 150 °C + 8.5 sun (Tcat = 231 °C), respectively, are 22.3, 25.0, and
54.8%. Compared to the best PTM reported for photomethanation of CO2 by Liu and co-workers,12 we realized
a substantially higher PTM (54.8 vs 46%) at lower temperature (231
vs 350 °C), lower light intensity (0.85 vs 2.7 W cm–2), and for broad-spectrum sunlight rather than for monochromatic
UV light of a wavelength of 365 nm.

In addition to the high
PTM achieved in this process, we have demonstrated
that conventional heating of the reactor is not required to promote
the methanation (Figure 4). At a solar intensity of 8.5 sun and Treactor = 25 °C, the reaction proceeded with a rate of 15.5 mmol CH4 gRu–1 h–1 (Figure 4a). At 25 °C
and 10.1 sun, the photomethanation rate (52 mmol CH4 gRu–1 h–1) was approximately
18 times higher than the previously reported7h 2.8 mmol CH4 gRu/SiO2–1 h–1 for Treactor =
25 °C and 24.7 sun (Figure 4b). Furthermore, for all sunlight intensities (5.7,
8.5, and 10.1 sun), the obtained reaction rates were higher than for
the dark reaction (calculated values based on the Arrhenius plot in Figure 3b), demonstrating
a nonthermal contribution to the reaction rate. The nonthermal contribution
to the reaction rate increases with increasing solar intensity.

catalyst temperature (●), and (b) produced amount of CH4 gRu–1 using the preactivated
Ru catalyst at 10.1 sun light intensity as a function of reaction
time. Reaction conditions: reaction mixture of H2/CO2/N2 (5:1:1) at 3.5 bar pressure, 300 mg preactivated
Ru catalyst, 25 °C under the illumination of 5.7, 8.5, or 10.1
sun light intensity. Initial rates upon illumination were determined
using multiple data points acquired in the first 15 min of the reaction;
initial rates in dark were calculated according to the Arrhenius plot
in Figure 3b.

To gain insight into this highly
efficient photomethanation, we
studied the RuO2 precatalyst (SI, S12 and S14) and the activated Ru catalyst with transmission electron
microscopy (TEM, Figure 5a–j), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Figure 5k), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(SI, S16). These studies confirm that the
RuO2 precatalyst, which consists of single crystalline
nanorods and has the orthorhombic RuO2 structure (SI, Figure S14), is transformed into the activated
Ru catalyst by solid-state recrystallization toward metallic Ru. This
is performed either under typical reaction conditions or upon reduction
with H2 (preactivated catalyst). TEM confirms that the
anisotropic shape of the RuO2 nanoparticles is largely
retained in the activated Ru catalyst. However, the recrystallization
process is initiated by many separate nucleation events of the metallic
phase, leading to polycrystalline Ru rods, as confirmed by the selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Figure 5j.

Analysis of Ru on the Al2O3 catalyst
(obtained
through reduction under typical reaction conditions) by bright-field
(BF)TEM and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron
microscopy (HAADF-STEM) (Figure 5a,b, respectively) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) mapping of Ru in the HAADF sample (Figure 5c) shows that Ru nanostructures are present
in a variety of shapes, among others nanospheres and (anisotropic)
nanorods, with a variety of sizes. Studying several samples, we determined
that the average diameter of the nanospheres was 11 ± 4 nm and
that the average length and width of the nanorods were 153 ±
45 and 11 ± 10 nm, respectively (TEM analysis, SI, S17). A representative, detailed TEM study of
two Ru nanocrystals supported on a few Al2O3 crystals found in our catalyst is displayed in Figure 5d–j. HAADF-STEM and
EDX-mapping of the elements Ru, O, and Al (Figure 5f–i) proved the metallic nature of
the nanorods. BF-TEM (Figure 5e) and HAADF-STEM (Figure 5d) imaging allowed us to determine that the Ru nanorods
are polycrystalline. This is further evidenced by the presence of
rings in the SAED pattern in Figure 5j. Finally, the crystallinity of the catalyst is confirmed
by XRD analysis (Figure 5k), giving reflections for the metallic Ru located at 2θ =
38.39 and 44.01°. From Scherrer analysis of the peak width in
the XRD patterns, we obtained an average grain size of 11 nm. This
is in agreement with the dimensions of the polycrystalline domains
in the nanorods as well as with the average diameter of the nanospheres.

To gain insight into the sunlight absorption properties of the
Ru catalyst, we determined the UV–vis–NIR diffuse reflectance
of a powder sample. The (100 – R) spectrum
of the KBr-diluted powder, which is directly related to its absorption,
is displayed in Figure 6a. The spectrum clearly shows that the Ru catalyst features a broad
and asymmetric absorption, which spans the UV–vis–NIR
range with a maximum at ∼310 nm. Given the large size and shape
polydispersity of the Ru nanoparticles present in our Ru catalyst
sample, it is important to disentangle their relative contribution
to the catalyst’s UV–vis–NIR light absorption
properties. For this purpose, we performed optical simulations based
on the boundary element method14 (BEM,
SI, S21 for details) to determine the extinction
spectra of the two most representative nanoparticle geometries present
in our catalyst sample: spherical Ru nanoparticles [diameter (ϕ)
= 11 nm, SI, S17 for details] and Ru nanorods
(length × width = 153 nm × 14 nm, SI, S17 for details). Based on the previous work performed on
polycrystalline Au nanorods and nanoshells, we anticipate that the
polycrystallinity of the Ru nanorods will not significantly influence
its plasmonic properties.15Figure 6b shows the calculated averaged
cross sections (comparable to the extinction cross sections) in the
250–850 nm wavelength range (full range spectra in SI, Figure S28) of those individual nanoparticles
dispersed in a γ-Al2O3 medium [which is
the actual catalyst support, n(γ-Al2O3) ∼1.766 at 2.059 eV].16 The calculated spectra resemble closely the experimental spectral
response of the Ru catalyst shown in Figure 6a. The calculated spectrum of the spherical
Ru nanoparticle is characterized by a steep extinction for λ
< 400 nm, which coincides with the onset of its characteristic
UV plasmon band17 (centered at ∼205
nm, SI, Figure S28a), by a weak shoulder
at ∼445 nm, and by an essentially featureless, and nonzero,
extinction for λ > 600 nm. The Ru nanorod also features a
steep
extinction for λ < 340 nm (its characteristic UV plasmon
band is centered at ∼184 nm, SI, Figure S28b). However, differently from the spherical Ru nanoparticle,
it features a significant extinction in the vis–NIR range resulting
from a broad and symmetric band centered at ∼620 nm and from
a (weaker) band peaking at ∼430 nm. Optical simulations performed
at different angles of light incidence (SI, Figure S29) indicate that the nanorod’s vis–NIR plasmon
bands at ∼430 and ∼620 nm occur only when the angle
of light incidence is ≠ 0° with respect to its longitudinal
axis, i.e., when its longitudinal plasmon modes are being excited.
On the other hand, the excitation of the nanorod’s UV plasmon
band at ∼184 nm (∼2-fold more intense than the vis–NIR
ones) occurs mainly upon illumination at 0° light incidence,
i.e., upon transverse plasmon mode excitation. Given the large size
of the Ru nanorod considered herein, it is likely that the nanorods
may accommodate not only dipolar plasmon resonances but also higher
order plasmon modes, as previously reported for other metal nanoparticles
of comparable dimensions.18 An accurate
plasmon mode assignment for both the UV and vis–NIR plasmon
bands of the Ru nanorod would therefore require a thorough optical
modeling investigation that goes beyond the scope of this work.

Figure 6 Optical characterization
and modeling of the Ru catalyst: (a) (100
– R) UV–vis–NIR spectrum of
the Ru catalyst (inset: representative photograph of the γ-Al2O3 supported Ru catalyst), (b) calculated UV–vis–NIR
extinction cross section of a single spherical Ru nanoparticle (11
nm diameter, dashed curve) and of a single Ru nanorod (length ×
width = 153 nm × 14 nm, aspect ratio = 10.9, solid curve) embedded
in a γ-Al2O3 medium (inset: scale depiction
of both nanoparticle types), and (c) solar spectrum coverage of our
experimental Ru catalyst (blue), of the modeled single spherical Ru
nanoparticle (11 nm, red patterned filling), and of the modeled Ru
nanorod (153 nm × 14 nm, red, nonpatterned, filling) as compared
to the AM 1.5 (ASTM G173) solar spectrum used in our work for sunlight-fueled
CO2 methanation (gray). Note that, for the sake of clarity,
the y-axis scale of the AM 1.5 spectrum (0–1.8
W m–2 nm–1) is not shown.

In any case, our optical modeling
results indicate that nonspherical,
anisotropic Ru nanoparticles, such as the large and high aspect ratio
Ru nanorods present in our catalyst sample, feature not only a characteristic
plasmon band in the UV but also plasmon bands that span the visible
and NIR range. Given that light absorption governs the overall contribution
to light extinction for both nanoparticle types (SI, Figure S30), it can be concluded that the broad-band absorption
of our γ-Al2O3-supported Ru catalyst (Figure 6a) is the result
of all plasmon band contributions from the randomly distributed spherical
and nonspherical Ru nanoparticles of various sizes present in our
catalyst sample and from the plasmon coupling effects that may arise
as a result of their sometimes small interparticle separation distances.19 Importantly, our results demonstrate that a
catalyst comprising solely Ru nanorods such as the ones presented
in this study features a plasmonic absorption profile that matches
that of the terrestrial AM 1.5 solar spectrum across the UV–vis–NIR
(Figure 6c), and it
clearly surpasses by manifold that of a similar catalyst that comprises
only small spherical Ru nanoparticles.

Because the aspect ratio of the
Ru nanorods is essential to the position of the LSPR (similar to Au
nanorods) and our Ru rods are highly polydispersed, length is 153
± 45 nm and width is 11 ± 10 nm, the broad-band character
of the extinction spectrum (Figure 6a) is even more pronounced than the results obtained
through optical simulations (Figure 6b). This is beneficial for harvesting sunlight and
should make the photomethanation largely wavelength independent. To
experimentally validate the direct connection of the impact of the
broad-band absorption of our Ru catalyst on its photomethanation activity,
we performed experiments at 150 °C and 1 sun light intensity
in the presence of a 395 nm and of a 495 nm longpass filter. Such
filters block all sunlight with wavelengths below 395 and 495 nm (SI, Figures S4 and S5), thus decreasing the overall
light intensity reaching the plasmonic particles (Figure 7). Comparing the formed methane
per gRu in the photomethanation with and without the use
of filters, the photomethanation with longpass filters gives a lower
amount of methane gRu–1 (Figure 7a, full spectrum: 100%; filter
<395 nm: 92.3%; filter <495 nm: 82.9% all in 60 min). However,
when normalizing the methane production results shown in Figure 7a with respect to
the solar intensity (Figure 7b), essentially the same amount of methane per gRu per sun is formed in those three experiments (Figure 7b, values for 60 min reaction time: full
spectrum, 1 sun light intensity: 100%; filter <395 nm, 0.93 sun
light intensity corrected to 1 sun light intensity: 99.3%; filter
<495 nm, 0.81 sun light intensity corrected to 1 sun light intensity:
102.3%), indicating that the photomethanation is wavelength independent
and thus that a broad-band sunlight absorption of the catalyst is
responsible for the methanation.

Figure 7 Effect of selective sunlight cutoff on
the Ru catalyst’s
photomethanation performance: (a) produced amount of methane gRu–1 using H2-activated Ru catalyst
under 1 sun illumination without filter (○), with a filter
that cuts off all light with a wavelength shorter than 395 nm (□),
and 495 nm (◊) as a function of reaction time, and (b) produced
amount of methane gRu–1 sun–1 as a function of reaction time for the above-mentioned cutoff filters.
Reaction conditions: reaction mixture of H2/CO2/N2 (5:1:1) at 3.5 bar total pressure, 300 mg H2-activated Ru catalyst, 150 °C, either 1, 0.93, or 0.81 sun
light intensity.

Furthermore, we studied
the photomethanation using Ru spheres instead
of rods. The Ru spheres supported on γ-Al2O3 were prepared via wet immersion and direct calcination under a reducing
atmosphere (Experimental Section). HAADF-STEM
analysis shows that the diameter of the randomly distributed spheres
is 0.88 ± 0.13 nm (Figure 8a), and through XRD analysis, we confirmed that the catalyst
consists of γ-Al2O3 and metallic Ru (SI, S15). Since individual Ru nanospheres do not
display a plasmon resonance in the solar spectrum, which was demonstrated
by the calculations performed in this study for 11 nm Ru spheres,
and confirmed for a broad range of sizes by other research groups,17 the resulting catalyst powder is black and displays
broad-band absorption properties between 300 and 800 nm (SI, S20). Through kinetic studies, we investigated
the reaction rate obtained with this catalyst in dark and upon illumination
with sunlight (1, 5.7, and 8.5 sun). Based on these results, we were
able to calculate the PTM′ using the equation reported above
with kd′ obtained at the same Treactor instead
of the same Tcat. For comparison, we calculated
the PTM′ obtained with the rods at the same reaction conditions
and with kd obtained at the same Treactor. The rods show significantly higher
values for PTM′, and the difference (Δ)PTM = PTM′rods – PTM′spheres is displayed in Figure 8b.

Figure 8 (a) HAADF-STEM image
of the spherical Ru catalyst, and (b) reactivity
and comparison of photon-to-methane efficiency and Tcat using rodlike vs spherical Ru-catalysts. The difference
in PTM′ obtained with Ru rods–Ru spheres at Treactor = 150 °C (blue diamond solid) and
measured Tcat for Ru rods (□) and
spheres (○) are depicted. Reaction conditions: reaction mixture
of H2/CO2/N2 (5:1:1) at 3.5 bar pressure,
300 mg preactivated Ru catalyst, 150 °C under the illumination
of 1, 5.7, or 8.5 sun light intensity.

In all cases, ΔPTM is larger than zero, which demonstrated
that the PTM′ is higher for rods than for spheres. Furthermore,
the difference in PTM′ increases with increasing light intensity
from 3.3% at 1 sun to 29.3% at 5.7 sun with similar catalyst temperatures
for both spheres and rods under these conditions. At 8.5 sun, ΔPTM
further increases to 41.5% and the catalyst temperature of the spheres
surpasses that of the rods by 15 °C. The fact that the Ru rods
are far more efficient catalysts than the Ru spheres upon solar illumination
supports the hypothesis that the plasmon resonance in the UV–vis–NIR
plays a crucial role in this catalytic process. For Ru spheres, this
is very weak and positioned in the UV; for Ru rods, the LSPR is stronger
and covers the entire solar spectrum (vide supra). Consequently, the
rods are much more efficient in harvesting sunlight and using the
corresponding energy to drive the photomethanation, which is a plausible
explanation for the distinct difference in activity. This difference
in the LSPR of Ru spheres and rods is in line with previously reported
plasmonic systems.20

Conclusions and Outlook
We have developed and characterized a rod-shaped Ru catalyst suited
for selective photoconversion of H2 and CO2 to
CH4 using sunlight as a sustainable energy source. Even
though this Ru catalyst leads to methane production in the absence
of light, upon illumination with terrestrial sunlight its activity
gets significantly enhanced. At 150 °C reactor temperature and
illumination with terrestrial sunlight (light intensity 1 sun), the
activity is enhanced by a factor 2.1. Detailed kinetic studies clearly
demonstrated that this enhancement could be fully attributed to heating
of the catalyst bed upon illumination (photothermal effect). At higher
light intensities of 5.7 and 8.5 sun, however, a significant nonthermal
contribution was observed. This was quantified as photon-to-methane
efficiencies of 22.3% (5.7 sun) and 54.8% (8.5 sun). Furthermore,
we demonstrated that external heating of the reactor is not required
to promote methanation when using slightly concentrated sunlight (8.5
or 10.1 sun). We attribute the sunlight-harvesting ability of the
catalyst and the high photon-to-methane efficiency of the process
to the UV–vis–NIR plasmonic absorption of the large,
nonspherical, rodlike Ru nanoparticles present in the catalyst. For
Ru spheres, with a plasmonic absorption outside of the solar spectrum
in the UV-C, we observed significantly lower photon-to-methane efficiency.
At 8.5 sun and 150 °C reactor temperature, the difference was
41.5%, whereas the catalyst temperature for the rods was approximately
15 °C lower than for the spheres. This insight is very valuable
for the further development of plasmon catalysts for photoconversions
using sunlight as an energy source. Further studies on the nature
of the nonthermal contribution reported in our manuscript are currently
ongoing in our laboratory. Our sunlight-fueled conversion of H2 to methane is a promising technology to simultaneously accelerate
the energy transition and reduce CO2 emissions.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of the RuO2 Precatalyst (Adapted Procedure
from Ref (21))
A 3.2 mM Ru precursor solution was obtained by dissolving
0.104 g (0.16 mmol, 1.6 mol %) of Ru3(CO)12 (Aldrich,
99%) in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Biosolve). The solution was
stirred for approximately 2 h until all solid was dissolved. γ-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99%, SA 200 m2 g–1) was calcined in air at 500 °C for 6 h. Then,
1 g (9.8 mmol, 98.4 mol %) of calcined γ-Al2O3 was added to the precursor solution resulting in a yellow
slurry. The solution was stirred for 4 h at room temperature. Subsequently,
THF was removed in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at 45
°C. Calcination of the resulting composite powder was done in
air with a heating ramp of 5 °C min–1 until
300 °C and at 300 °C for 2 h. After reduction, the Ru content
was 6.0 wt %, as determined by inductively coupled plasma optical
emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). STEM–EDX and XRD analyses
were performed to study the composition and architecture of the RuO2 precatalyst (SI, S12 and S14).
Surface Brunauer–Emmett–Teller area was determined to
be 171 g m–2.

Preactivation with H2 of the Precatalyst to Form
the Active Rod-Shaped Ru Catalyst
The resulting material
after calcination was reduced under a hydrogen flow (10% H2 in Ar, 300 mL min–1) with a heating ramp of 5
°C min–1 until 250 °C and 250 °C
for 2 h. STEM–EDX and XRD analyses were performed to study
the composition and architecture of the Ru catalyst (vide supra).

Preparation of the Spherical Ru Catalyst
A 3.2 mM Ru precursor solution was obtained by dissolving 0.104 g (0.16
mmol, 1.6 mol %) of Ru3(CO)12 (Aldrich, 99%)
in 50 mL of THF (Biosolve). The solution was stirred for approximately
2 h until all solid was dissolved. γ-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99%, SA 200 m2 g–1) was
calcined in air at 500 °C for 6 h. Then, 1 g (9.8 mmol, 98.4
mol %) of calcined γ-Al2O3 was added to
the precursor solution resulting in a yellow slurry. The solution
was stirred for 4 h at room temperature. Subsequently, THF was removed
in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at 45 °C. The resulting
material was reduced under a hydrogen flow (10% H2 in Ar,
300 mL min–1) with a heating ramp of 5 °C min–1 until 250 °C and kept under hydrogen at 250
°C for 2 h. After reduction, the Ru content was 4.79 wt % determined
by ICP-OES analysis. STEM–EDX and XRD analyses were performed
to study the composition and architecture of the Ru catalyst.

Photomethanation
Experiments
A homemade photoreactor
equipped with a solar simulator (Newport Sol3A) and reaction cell
with quartz window was used for the sunlight-fueled methanation reaction
(SI, S3). N2 was used as an
internal standard. The reactor was prepared by filling the reactor
with the catalyst (300 mg) and N2 and subsequent evacuation
three times. Then, the reactor was filled with the reaction mixture
of H2 (Linde 6.0) and CO2 (Linde 4.5) and diluted
with N2 (Linde 5.0) with the ratio H2/CO2/N2 (5:1:1) until the total pressure was 3.5 bar
(2.5 bar overpressure). Prior to each experiment, the temperature
was stabilized to the desired reactor temperature in the range of
25–150 °C using electrical heating. During the experiment,
the catalyst was irradiated from the top through the quartz window.
The irradiation source was a solar light simulator provided with a
filter of air mass coefficient 1.5 (AM 1.5), conventionally taken
to 1 kW m–2. Concentrated sunlight was obtained
with optical elements (high flux beam concentrator, Newport 81030)
up to an intensity of 10.1 sun. The moment the lamp is switched on
is considered the starting time of the reaction; the CH4 formation before the starting time is subtracted from the light
experiments. Gas samples were taken from the reactor using a gas leak
tight syringe. Gas (3 mL) was taken from the upper part of the reactor
at different times and directly measured in the gas chromatograph
(compact GC Interscience). The GC is equipped with three channels,
two micro thermal conductivity detectors (TCD), and one flame ionization
detector (FID). The first channel, used to measure H2,
O2, N2, and CO, is equipped with a MolSieve
5 Å column and RT-Q bond precolumn and TCD detector. The second
channel, used to measure H2O and CO2, is equipped
with a combination of TR-U bond column and RT-Q bond column and TCD
detector. The third channel, used to measure methane, ethane, and
propane, is fitted with a Rtx-1, 2u column, and FID detector.

Blank experiments in the presence of the catalyst at 150 °C
and illumination without CO2 showed no reaction products,
confirming that CH4 comes from the CO2. Also,
no activity was shown when H2 was not present in the reaction
and when the catalyst was left out.
