Doping
carbon materials with transition metal ions can greatly
expand their utility, given these metal ions’ unique catalytic
activity, for example, in oxygen reduction in proton exchange membrane
fuel cells. Unlike main group dopants, a counter anion to the metal
cation must be selected and this choice has hitherto received little
attention for this synthesis method. Herein, we describe the profound
effects that the anion has on the resultant iron/nitrogen-doped ordered
mesoporous carbons (Fe-OMC). To increase the iron loading and the
number of iron-centered catalytically active sites, we selected three
iron salts Fe(OAc)2, Fe(OTf)2, and Fe(BF4)2·6H2O, which show greatly enhanced
solubility in the liquid carbon precursor (furfurylamine) compared
to FeCl3·6H2O. The increased solubility
leads to a significantly higher iron loading in the Fe-OMC prepared
with Fe(OTf)2, but the increase in performance as cathode
catalysts in fuel cells is only marginal. The Fe-OMCs prepared with
Fe(OAc)2 and Fe(BF4)2·6H2O exhibited similar or lower iron loadings compared to the
Fe-OMC prepared with FeCl3·6H2O despite
their much higher solubilities. Most importantly, the different iron
salts affect not only the final iron loading, but also which type
of iron species forms in the Fe-OMC with different types showing different
catalytic activity.

Introduction
Carbon materials are
prized for their many desirable characteristics
including electrical conductivity, porosity, chemical inertness, and
low density, allowing them to find applications in supercapacitors,
CO2 capture, batteries, fuel cells, and catalysis among
others.1−4 To increase the utility of carbon materials, different techniques
exist to improve their porosity, functionality, and reactivity. One
such method is doping, which is the purposeful incorporation of heteroatoms
into the carbonaceous structure. This is typically accomplished via
a bottom-up method, wherein organic precursors are treated at high
temperatures (600–1200 °C) under an inert atmosphere with
a template- or structure-directing agent (e.g., mesoporous silica,5 nanoparticulate CaCO3,6 eutectic salt mixtures,7 and
phenol–formaldehyde resins8). The
latter enables formation of a porous and high surface area carbon,
while the former determines its dopant elements.9−11 In the context
of an application, the dopant atoms can play just as important of
a role as the carbon’s porosity.12 Most studies on doping deal with doping with p-block elements such
as nitrogen,7,13−17 boron,18−21 phosphorous,22,23 and sulfur.12,24,25 For doping with these elements,
a wide variety of cheap, abundant carbon precursors are available
given these elements’ propensity for forming strong, covalent
bonds with carbon and their importance in organic chemistry. However,
doping carbon materials with transition metal elements requires a
different approach. One such method involves the carbonization of
preformed metal complexes and macrocycles such as porphyrins,26−30 phthalocyanines,31−33 and phenanthroline34,35 complexes.
Disadvantages of this method include the cost of such precursors and
their molecular size which may preclude impregnation into the structure-directing
agent/template. Another method involves dissolving transition metal
salts, directly into a carbon precursor solution.6,36,37 During the carbon synthesis process, the
metal ion is incorporated into the carbon structure along with any
codopants, typically nitrogen, which help to form coordinate covalent
bonds to the transition metal in the final carbon structure. These
metal-centered structures are the active sites for chemical transformations,
in particular the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).36−39 For iron- and nitrogen-doped
ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs), such sites are designated as Fe–Nx.

Unlike p-block dopants, doping with
transition metal salts necessarily
involves selecting a counter anion to the cation of the salt. Very
few studies exist that systematically explore the effect of the counter
anion on the resultant carbon material while using the same metal
cation.40 For metal salts with a multivalent
cation and a monovalent anion, doping will involve two or three times
the number of anions as cations. In principle, during the heat treatment
of the carbon precursor solution, the anion can undergo various processes:
it can decompose, form gaseous products, and either react with carbon
or leave it largely unaffected (e.g., NO3– to NOx, C2O42– to CO and CO2); it can carbonize along
with the carbon precursor if the anion contains sufficiently high
amounts of carbon (e.g., acetate, cyclopentadienyl, and trifluoromethanesulfonate);
or, if no decomposition or pyrolysis pathways are available, it can
itself be incorporated into the carbon structure thereby adding an
extra dopant.

Additionally, the anion can also exert a profound
influence on
the synthetic process. Within the context of using a lipophilic liquid
carbon precursor, the nature of the counter anion determines the solubility
of the salt in the carbon precursor solution. It must be stressed
that the final metal loading and, in turn, the number of iron active
sites of the resultant carbon material is most likely influenced by
the solubility of the salt. In our previous studies using furfurylamine
as the carbon precursor with KIT-6 silica as the template for the
creation of iron- and cobalt-doped OMCs, the dopant salts FeCl3·6H2O and CoCl2 exhibited relatively
limited solubility.36,37 In this study, we aim to increase
the final metal loadings by using alternative iron salts with organic-soluble
anions, with the goal to increase the number of Fe–Nx active sites for the ORR.

Experimental Methods
Chemicals
and Reagents
The iron salts FeCl3·6H2O (≥99%), Fe(OAc)2 (≥99.99%),
Fe(OTf)2 (≥85%), Fe(BF4)2·6H2O (97%), and furfurylamine (≥99%) carbon precursor/solvent
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

Preparation
of Saturated Iron Salt Solutions in Furfurylamine
The salts
Fe(OAc)2, Fe(OTf)2, and Fe(BF4)2·6H2O show exothermic dissolution
in furfurylamine so care must be taken so as to not prepolymerize
the furfurylamine solvent. Furfurylamine (3 mL) was transferred to
a 10 mL centrifuge tube and was cooled to 0 °C in an ice-water
bath with a small magnetic stir bar. The iron salt was added in small
portions (50–100 mg) while stirring the solution at 0 °C.
Enough salt was added such that small amounts of the undissolved solid
could be observed at the bottom of the tube. The ice bath was removed,
and the solution was allowed to warm to RT. The solution was sonicated
for 3 min to ensure complete dissolution of the iron salt and was
then centrifuged for 1 min at 5600 rpm. If no solid was observed at
the bottom of the tube, the solution was re-cooled to 0 °C and
more salt was added. The process was repeated until saturation was
reached and solid salt was observed at RT. Fresh iron salt solutions
were prepared for each impregnation.

Synthesis of Fe-Doped OMCs
Mesoporous silica (KIT-6)
was prepared according to a published procedure5 and was used as a template for all mesoporous carbon catalysts.
All samples were prepared from the same batch of KIT-6. The KIT-6
template was dried at 150 °C overnight (16 h) before use. Into
a 60 mL quartz crucible (Saveen Werner) was placed 2 g of dried KIT-6.
Silica was allowed to cool to room temperature and a volume of the
dissolved iron salt in furfurylamine was added to the silica. The
volume added corresponded to the pore volume of the silica (2 mL).
The slurry was thoroughly mixed to ensure complete pore filling. After
mixing, the impregnated silica was a homogeneous brown color and was
gently pressed into a single piece in the bottom of the crucible.
The top of the crucible was covered with parafilm and then a quartz
crucible lid. All crucibles were placed in a Styrofoam box overnight
(16 h) to allow for complete impregnation of the silica in the absence
of light. The crucibles were taken out from the box and the lid and
parafilm removed. The crucibles were covered tightly with aluminum
foil and heated in an air oven at 100 °C for 2 h then at 160
°C
for 2 additional hours to polymerize furfurylamine. The black silica–polymer
composite was transferred to a 40 mL aluminum crucible (Almath) and
heated at a rate of 15 °C min–1 to 950 °C,
where it was carbonized for 4 h. All samples were carbonized individually.
The carbon–silica composites were ball milled for 30 min at
15 Hz using a Retsch MM400 ball mill with a 25 mL ZrO2-coated
cup and a 15 mm diameter ZrO2 ball. Thereafter, nitrogen
sorption was performed on the carbon–silica composite to determine
the residual pore volume. The previous process of impregnation, polymerization,
and pyrolysis was repeated once more with the once-filled carbon–silica
composites. The only change to this procedure for the second round
was the volume of iron salt solution in furfurylamine added to the
carbon–silica composite corresponded to the residual pore volume,
and the sample was pyrolyzed for 6 h at 950 °C. The silica template
was removed by acid washing with 40 wt % HF in H2O at room
temperature followed by stirring in distilled water for 24 h at RT.
A postsynthetic acidic treatment was performed by heating the OMC
in an aqueous 0.5 M H2SO4 for 6 h at 80 °C
followed by filtering and washing with distilled water before a final
pyrolysis at 950 °C for 2 h. Finally, the samples were once more
ball milled but now for 1 h each at 15 Hz before characterization.

Instrumental Techniques
Powder X-ray diffractograms
were recorded on all samples using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE and Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). The 2θ range covered was 10°–80°
with a step size of 0.025° and a dwell time at each point of
3 s. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on approximately
10 mg of OMC in a 50 μL alumina crucible in air. The temperature
was increased at a rate of 25 °C min–1 to 900
°C, where it was kept for 20 min. For the orange powder residue
created from the TGA of a sample of OTf-Fe-OMC, a “zero height”
X-ray diffraction (XRD) holder was used. Surface area, pore volume,
and pore size distribution were measured by nitrogen sorption using
a TriStar 3000 instrument from Micromeritics. All samples were degassed
for a minimum of 3 h at 200 °C under a nitrogen flow. The surface
areas and pore volumes were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) algorithms, respectively,
on the adsorption isotherm. Elemental analysis (EA) was performed
on an Elementar Vario MICRO Cube HCNS analyzer on approximately 2
mg of sample. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) was conducted on a Philips
MagiX PW2424 X-ray spectrometer equipped with a Rh tube instrument.
About 50 mg of Fe-OMC was evenly distributed between two polypropylene
films in the sample holder. The measured data was evaluated using
the UniQuant and IQ+ applications. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
experiments were carried out using a Mat:Nordic instrument from SAXSLAB.
The setup used was equipped with a Rigaku high brilliance microfocus
X-ray source with Cu Kα radiation. The sample was placed in
an evacuated sample chamber and the entire space between the collimator
and detector was evacuated to minimize air scattering. A Pilatus 300K
detector was used to record the scattering intensity. The sample-to-detector
distance was about 1580 mm as obtained from a calibration of the scattering
angle 2θ using silver behenate as a reference. A sandwich cell
holder was used for the carbon powders. X-band electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectroscopy measurements were conducted on powder
samples (10 mg) in quartz tubes using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 EPR. The
modulation power was 6.345 mW and the modulation amplitude 5G.

Rotating
Disk Electrode Measurements
Rotating disk
electrode (RDE) measurements were carried out using a three-electrode
instrument (Gamry Instruments) at room temperature. A graphite-rod
(6 mm-diameter) counter electrode and Ag/AgClsat reference
electrode were used. All potentials reported in this study were converted
to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). A glassy carbon (diameter:
5.0 mm) RDE was used as the working electrode. This electrode was
polished with a 1.0 μm diamond suspension and then with a 0.5
μm alumina suspension followed by copious washing with water
and ethanol in order to give it a mirror-like finish. Catalyst inks
were prepared by mixing 10 mg of the Fe-OMC catalyst with 95 μL
of Nafion solution (5 wt % in lower aliphatic alcohols and water,
Sigma-Aldrich) and 350 μL of absolute ethanol (VWR). After sonication
for 30 min assuring a homogenous dispersion, a 5 μL ink aliquot
was drop-coated onto the well-polished glassy carbon electrode and
dried at ambient conditions for 30 min. The resulting catalyst loading
for all cases was 580 μg cm–2. A steady-state
program was run on all catalysts in 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.1
M KOH both bubbled with oxygen until saturation at four different
rotation speeds: 100, 400, 900, and 1600 rpm. The program started
at 1 V versus RHE and decreased in steps of 30 mV with a holding time
of 60 s, down to 0 V versus RHE.

Screen Printing of the
Cathode Electrode and Preparation of
the MEA
In the preparation of the fuel cell cathode electrode
ink, 0.2 g of propylene glycol (99% Sigma-Aldrich), 1.65 g Nafion
D2021 solution (Fuel cell store), and 1 drop (about 0.02 g) of dispersant
KD2, were mixed in a vial. Thereafter, 0.5 g of the Fe-OMC catalyst
powder was added and mixed with an Ultrathurrax (Heidolph, Silent
Crusher M) for about 2 min, followed by the addition of 0.13 g Vulcan
XC-72R (Fuel Cell Store) and once again mixing with an Ultrathurrax
for about 2 min. The inks were screen printed with a Dyenamo DN-HM02
Laboratory screen-printer on Toray Paper TGP-H-060 (Fuel Cell Earth)
as squares with an area of 2.56 cm2. The printed catalysts
were dried and then washed carefully in deionized water to remove
propylene glycol. The catalyst loading was about 1.6 mg cm–2. A commercial Pt/C catalyst (10 wt % Pt/Vulcan with 0.5 mg Pt cm–2 from Quintech) was used at the anode side. To complete
the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) a commercial ionomer, Nafion
Membrane NM-212 (Quintech), was used. Detailed parameters for the
MEA preparation are given in the cited reference.41

Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Measurements
The
PEM fuel cell tests of the prepared catalyst materials were done in
a single cell fuel cell, using a commercial 5 cm2 polymer
electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) from Scribner Assoc. with an
effective electrode area of 2.56 cm2. All measurements
were done at 80 °C. The cell was fueled with fully humidified
100% H2 (instrumental grade from AGA) and using synthetic
air (instrumental grade from AGA) as a fully humidified oxidant. A
back pressure of 1.5 bar was applied at both the anode and cathode
side of the cell.

Results and Discussion
The main
goal of this study was to increase the iron content of
the final Fe-OMC by using more organic soluble salts, which, in turn,
should hopefully increase the Fe-OMCs’ catalytic activity toward
the ORR. We selected iron(II) tetrafluoroborate hexahydrate, Fe(BF4)2·6H2O, and iron(II) trifluoromethanesulfonate,
Fe(OTf)2, as lipophilic salts with weakly coordinating
anions, which should allow for increased coordination between the
amine groups and iron cations. We also selected iron(II) acetate,
Fe(OAc)2, as a salt with increased solubility with an organic
anion. Unlike the other three salts investigated, the acetate anion
in Fe(OAc)2 does not add any additional elements to the
precursor mixture. Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate, FeCl3·6H2O, was used as the reference dopant.42 The Fe-OMCs are designated by their anion; for
example, the Fe-OMC prepared using FeCl3·6H2O as the dopant salt is referenced as Cl-Fe-OMC. References to the
salt itself use the full name.

As expected, the salts Fe(OAc)2, Fe(OTf)2, and Fe(BF4)2·6H2O are significantly
more soluble in the furfurylamine solvent than the standard FeCl3·6H2O (about 5–7 times more, see Table 1). These solutions
in furfurylamine are nearly black in color whereas FeCl3·6H2O is only slightly brown. The potential for strong
exotherms upon dissolution causing premature polymerization of the
furfurylamine solvent also proved troublesome, which is why all mixing
was performed at 0 °C. The higher viscosities of these solutions
required extending the template-impregnation times (16 h) to ensure
efficient pore filling. After template removal with HF, the Fe-OMCs
were subjected to a sulfuric acid washing step followed by an additional
carbonization to remove any undesirable iron species that are not
bound or coordinated to the nitrogen-modified carbon matrix. This
treatment has previously been found to improve the ORR performance
of Fe-OMCs in PEMFCs.36

Elemental Compositions
To determine
the elemental compositions
and to assess if the iron content was indeed increased in the final
Fe-OMC catalysts, we performed EA, XRF, and TGA on the prepared Fe-OMCs.
EA quantifies the amounts of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur
present by analyzing the gases after combustion while XRF measures
the iron content. The TGA, which was ran to 900 °C in air, determines
the H2O content (hydration weight) and the residual mass
after combustion. All iron was assumed to be part of the residual
mass and the difference between these two was assumed to be other
nonvolatile elements (e.g., B). The difference between all seven masses
and 100 wt % was assumed to be nondetectible volatile elements (e.g.,
O, F, and Cl). The results for all three methods are summarized in Table 2 and the details are
given in the Supporting Information. EA
reveals a large nitrogen content in Cl-Fe-OMC, OTf-Fe-OMC, and BF4-Fe-OMC, indicating that the nitrogen functionality from the
furfurylamine carbon precursor was successfully incorporated into
the carbon structure; the nitrogen content should allow for ligating
atoms to iron cations to form Fe–Nx chelates. OAc-Fe-OMC, however, exhibits a markedly lower nitrogen
content, which also correlates with measurably lower hydration content,
likely indicating a more hydrophobic carbon. All samples show some
sulfur content, perhaps due to the postsynthesis treatment with sulfuric
acid. OTf-Fe-OMC displays a much higher sulfur content of a few wt
%. This is likely due to the sulfur atoms in the trifluoromethanesulfonate
counter anion; this anion carbonizes along with the furfurylamine
precursor.

The XRF results
demonstrate that all samples prepared contain iron.
Comparing the order of solubilities of the salts with the resulting
iron contents in the formed Fe-OMCs, it is clear that iron incorporation
is not directly related to the solubility of the salts alone. This
is exemplified in the case of Fe(OAc)2 in that its solubility
is ca. 5 fold greater than FeCl3·6H2O,
but generates the lowest iron loading for its respective Fe-OMC at
ca. 0.11 wt %, or about one-fourth the iron loading for Cl-Fe-OMC.
The lower iron loading of OAc-Fe-OMC correlates with its low nitrogen
content, suggesting that the iron loading is limited by the number
of ligating atoms to form Fe–Nx chelates. The iron and nitrogen loadings of BF4-Fe-OMC
is quite similar to Cl-Fe-OMC, but its other nonvolatile mass is considerably
larger than the other three Fe-OMCs, which could be due to boron-
and/or fluorine-containing species formed from the BF4– anions. The amorphous, brown state of the residue
from the TGA burn-off is consistent with this assignment. This residue,
unfortunately, adhered too strongly to the crucible for further analysis.
The iron loading for OTf-Fe-OMC is much higher than the other three
at nearly 4 wt %, which suggests that some soluble iron salts can
indeed increase the final iron loading. The nitrogen loading of OTf-Fe-OMC
is, however, lower than the Cl-Fe-OMC, whereas the sulfur content
is very high, suggesting that the iron in OTf-Fe-OMC is, at least
partly, associated with sulfur as Fe1–xS (see Figure 3d). Interestingly, the combustion of OTf-Fe-OMC in TGA resulted in
an orange-red powder, which was amenable for XRD analysis (XRD, Figure S2). The X-ray diffractogram is consistent
with Fe2O3, which is to be expected to form
from oxidation of Fe1–xS at 900
°C. The mass of the TGA-combusted sample together with its known
chemical identity allows for another method of determining the iron
content of this Fe-OMC, which was calculated to be 3.26 wt %. This
value is slightly lower than the 3.88 wt % as determined by XRF but
is still appreciably higher than the other three Fe-OMCs. Overall,
these results indicated that the nature of the counter anion exerts
a profound influence on the final iron loading and on the type of
iron species formed in the Fe-OMC.

Evaluation of Fe-OMCs as
Fuel Cell Cathode Catalysts
The Fe-OMC’s catalytic
activity was evaluated in a single
cell PEMFC. The polarization plots of the four samples are shown in Figure 1. In the kinetically
controlled region (low current densities), Cl-Fe-OMC performs best
with the highest voltage, indicating that this catalyst has the highest
activity toward the ORR. At higher current densities, OTf-Fe-OMC and
BF4-Fe-OMC outperform Cl-Fe-OMC, which suggests better
mass transport in these Fe-OMCs. In the power plots (Figure S3), OTf-Fe-OMC and BF4-Fe-OMC provide slightly
higher maximum power outputs compared to Cl-Fe-OMC. The relatively
low activity values obtained for all samples are similar to those
reported earlier for Cl-Fe-OMC samples prepared under similar conditions
with a pyrolysis temperature of 950 °C.43 The OAc-Fe-OMC sample shows the highest overpotential and the worst
performance over all current densities studied. Such low performance
is indicative of a low number of ORR active sites, which correlates
well to its low iron and nitrogen loadings because these elements
are strongly associated with the active site itself and/or its formation.36−38

Figure 1 (a)

regions measured in a single cell PEM fuel cell for Fe-OMCs. Measured
at 80 °C, 100% relative humidity, 1.5 bar backpressure on both
electrodes, H2 (100%) flow rate 100 mL min–1, air flow rate 200 mL min–1, Nafion membrane NRE-212
used, Fe-OMC loading on the cathode GDLs was about 1.6 mg/cm2.

Despite its higher iron content,
OTf-Fe-OMC does not exhibit correspondingly
better performance in the PEMFC. To further elucidate the mechanism
of O2 reduction, we studied the Fe-OMCs on RDEs. The Fe-OMCs
were first studied in 0.1 M HClO4 to approximate the acidic
polymer electrolyte of the PEMFCs, albeit at 25 °C instead of
80 °C (Figure 2a). Cl-Fe-OMC shows the highest half-wave potential (E1/2) at 0.68 V versus RHE with OTf-Fe-OMC and BF4-Fe-OMC closely behind at 0.62 and 0.56 V, respectively. OAc-Fe-OMC
performed much worse, exhibiting a high overpotential and an E1/2 of 0.44 V. These results corroborate those
found in PEMFCs, where the better performance of Cl-Fe-OMC at lower
current densities could be attributed to a lower overpotential in
acidic media. We also applied the Koutecky–Levich equation
to the electrode current densities at different rotating rates in
order to determine the number of transferred electrons per O2 molecule as a function of applied potential (Figures 1b, S4, and S7, left; details in the Supporting Information). Based on this calculation,
Cl-Fe-OMC follows a four-electron reduction mechanism over all potentials
up to 0.7 V. OTf-Fe-OMC and BF4-Fe-OMC also follow a four-electron
transfer mechanism, except at higher potentials (less overpotential)
where this number drops to about three at 0.7 V. This, too, corroborates
the PEMFC results in that Cl-Fe-OMC performs best at higher potentials
(lower current densities) but this difference is partly negated at
lower potentials (higher current densities) where additional aspects
of electrode resistance and mass transport become increasingly important.
In contrast, the mechanism of the OAc-Fe-OMC follows a much different
trend. At low potentials, it follows a four-electron mechanism and
this number is reduced to less than one at higher potentials, leading
to an incomplete ORR and the formation of H2O2 and/or other partially reduced oxygen species. This trend matches
well to the poor performance of this catalyst in PEMFC and its lower
nitrogen and iron content.

Figure 2 (a) RDE polarization plots collected in the
O2-saturated
0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte at 10 mV s–1 with
a rotation rate of 900 rpm at room temperature and (b) number of electrons
transferred for the Fe-OMC catalysts as determined by the Koutecky–Levich
equation. At potentials greater than 0.8 V, the number of electrons
transferred was determined to be zero for all Fe-OMC catalysts.

An additional ORR study was carried out in 0.1
M KOH solution saturated
with oxygen (Figure S5a). In this case,
we observed a better performance compared to 0.1 M HClO4 for all four Fe-OMCs in terms of the E1/2 and number of electrons transferred. The OTf-Fe-OMC is slightly
better than the other Fe-OMCs with an E1/2 of 0.86 V. The Cl-Fe-OMC and BF4-Fe-OMC demonstrate very
similar E1/2 of 0.845 V while the OAc-Fe-OMC,
as before, performs the worst with an E1/2 of 0.78 V. The number of electrons transferred is roughly four at
lower potentials until 0.7 V, at which point the number decreases
consistently for all catalysts with the OAc-Fe-OMC catalyst exhibiting
the lowest number at each potential between 0.7 and 0.9 V (Figures S5b, S6, and S7, right). The improved
performance for all Fe-OMCs can be attributed to the reduced adsorption
energies of anions in the alkaline environment, specifically of the
hydrogen peroxide intermediate (HO2–),
which reduces overpotentials for further electron transfer.44,45 However, we could again confirm that OAc-Fe-OMC has the poorest
performance among the four Fe-OMCs.

Further Characterization
of Fe-OMCs
The textural nature
of the OMCs also has an impact on the catalyst performance, so it
was investigated by nitrogen sorption, SAXS and XRD. The nitrogen
isotherms show that the nature of the iron salt has a strong influence
on the surface area and pore structure (Table 3 and Figure 3a). While all samples
had similar BJH pore volumes, the surface area of Cl-Fe-OMC is considerably
higher than the other three, by about a factor of two. The higher
surface area could enhance the catalytic activity of this OMC in PEMFCs
by supplying a higher number of active sites on the surface. While
all four OMCs yield distorted type IV isotherms, only Cl-Fe-OMC, OTf-Fe-OMC,
and BF4-Fe-OMC show a steep rise over small pressure changes
indicative of well-defined pore diameters. Indeed, Figure 3b reveals that these Fe-OMCs
have relatively narrow pore size distributions with relatively sharp
maxima around 41, 52, and 60 Å, respectively. OAc-Fe-OMC exhibits
an isotherm indicative of a partly macroporous material and a much
broader pore diameter distribution with a shallow maximum around 25
Å. The larger pore diameters of OTf-Fe-OMC and BF4-Fe-OMC could explain their enhanced performance in PEMFCs at higher
current densities where mass transport of the water exhaust becomes
the limiting factor.

Figure 3 (a) Nitrogen isotherms, (b) pore diameter distributions
based on
the adsorption isotherm, (c) SAXS plots (SAXS), and (d) X-ray diffractograms
for Fe-OMCs. In the SAXS and XRD plots, the traces have been offset
in intensity for clarity.

The SAXS patterns corroborate these differences in the pore structure
(Figure 3c). We observe
that Cl-Fe-OMC, OTf-Fe-OMC, and BF4-Fe-OMC exhibit mesostructured
pore systems that are negative replicas of the KIT-6 silica template,
which gives a cubic Ia3d structure, with the typical
(211) and (220) reflections.5 The lattice
constants of Cl-Fe-OMC, OTf-Fe-OMC, and BF4-Fe-OMC are
similar with values of 18.8, 18.7, and 18.3 nm, respectively, which
confirm the typical lattice sizes of such a cubic structure formed
in OMCs using KIT-6 as a template. However, OAc-Fe-OMC diffracts only
weakly indicating a lack of periodicity in the mesoscale and a poorly
defined pore structure. This lack of a mesostructure adds another
reason to explain the poor performance of this OMC in electrochemical
testing; its disordered pore system could impede mass transport to
the active sites, thereby attenuating its efficiency in the ORR.

XRD can yield valuable information on the atomic structure of the
Fe-OMCs; it reveals the degree of graphitization of Fe-OMC and if
crystalline metal or metal oxide nanoparticles are present. All four
diffractograms (Figure 3d) show the expected peaks at 2θ values of 26° and 43°,
corresponding to the reflections (002) and (101) of amorphous carbon.11 However, their intensity differs markedly: OAc-Fe-OMC
shows much sharper and intense peaks at these angles in addition to
two more at 54° and 78°, indicating a higher level of graphitization
compared to the other Fe-OMCs. The carbonizable acetate anion in Fe(OAc)2 likely helps the graphitization process and the high concentration
of iron ions could catalyze it. Because graphitization is known to
remove heteroatoms from the carbon structure, the low iron and nitrogen
loadings and high carbon content in OAc-Fe-OMC is consistent with
its more graphitic structure.11 BF4-Fe-OMC exhibits a more graphitic structure as well, although
less so than OAc-Fe-OMC. Two very weak diffraction peaks for OTf-Fe-OMC
were observed between 30° and 35°, suggesting the presence
of some crystalline particles in the OTf-Fe-OMC sample such as Fe1–xS.43 No
sharp diffraction peaks were observed for any of the other Fe-OMCs,
signifying low amounts or the complete absence of iron or iron oxide/sulfide
particles.

Probing the Active Site: Electron Paramagnetic
Resonance
To gain insight into the nature of the active sites,
we characterized
the Fe-OMCs with EPR spectroscopy. Using this technique, species with
unpaired electrons such as radicals and many transition metal ions
are detectable. Unpaired electrons occur in iron species depending
on its spin and oxidation states including Fe(III) and high-spin Fe(II)
species. For a Fe-centered active site with activity toward the ORR,
its spin and oxidation states are expected to be influenced by its
interaction with O2. To study such Fe–O2 interactions, the catalyst powders were, prior to the EPR-measurements,
flushed with either nitrogen or air atmospheres. Furthermore, the
experiments were performed at two different temperatures (295 and
120 K) because many EPR signals are temperature dependent. In a detailed
EPR study, we have learned that changing the atmosphere and/or temperature
among measurements enables the origin of the EPR signals from Fe-OMCs.46 In the present study, EPR was mainly used to
determine the presence or absence of iron in the Fe-OMC catalysts
and to identify possible differences in types of iron species present
in the different samples.

As shown in Figure 4, EPR-signals were observed in all Fe-OMCs.
The signals are consistent with the presence of paramagnetic iron
species and confirm coordination of iron within the OMC structure.46 However, panels (a and b) show clear differences
in the EPR-signals for the four synthesized Fe-OMCs, which confirms
that the different iron salts strongly impact the catalysts’
final iron coordination and the formation of different iron species
during the synthesis.

Figure 4 (a) EPR spectra measured at 295 K, (b) EPR spectra at
120 K, (c)
zoom in of the spectra at 295 K, and (d) zoom-in of spectra at 120
K for OAc-Fe-OMC (red), Cl-Fe-OMC (black), BF4-Fe-OMC (blue),
and OTf-Fe-OMC (green). Spectra were taken either in air (solid line)
or a nitrogen atmosphere (dotted line). The traces have been offset
in intensity for clarity. *Sample OAc-Fe-OMC was not amenable for
analysis in a nitrogen atmosphere at 120 K.

In general, the EPR-spectra of the BF4-Fe-OMC and Cl-Fe-OMC
look rather similar, which may simply indicate that the use of the
two iron salts (Fe(BF4)2·6H2O and FeCl3·6H2O) results in similar types
of Fe-OMCs regarding the iron coordination. Although, it should be
mentioned that low-spin iron(II) species are EPR-silent and therefore
undetectable with EPR. Accordingly, despite the considerably higher
solubility of Fe(BF4)2·6H2O
compared to FeCl3·6H2O in the carbon precursor
solution, the iron-coordination in the final catalyst ends up being
similar from an EPR perspective. The similar iron loadings and electrochemical
performance of these Fe-OMCs corroborate this hypothesis. The large
concentration of other nonvolatile elements in BF4-Fe-OMC
(Table 2), which is
likely boron and/or fluorine species produced from the BF4– anions, appear not to have a significant influence
on the iron coordination or catalytic activity. In the case of these
two Fe-OMCs, the small electrochemical differences between them may
rather relate to the carbon structure, as has been shown in XRD and
nitrogen sorption (Figure 3).

By studying the EPR-spectra measured in air at 120
K (Figure 4d), a signal
around
1500 G (g = 4.25) denoted R, a sharp
signal around ∼3400 G (g = ∼2.00) denoted OI, and a signal around ∼3200
G (g = ∼2.07) denoted OII, could be observed.45 The R signal appears in all materials studied, although the amplitude
of the signal in OAc-Fe-OMC is considerably lower. This signal is
typically attributed to high spin iron(III) in a rhombic structure.45,47−49 The reduction in signal amplitude is noticeable when
the Fe-OMC is flushed with nitrogen. We hypothesize that this change
in the signal is associated with an iron(II) species that is not detectable
or EPR-silent under nitrogen exposure, which is partly oxidized to
a paramagnetic iron(III) species (in air) by iron interaction with
oxygen.46 The OI and OII signals
are assigned to an oxygen radical (possibly superoxide) which is formed
when dioxygen oxidizes iron(II) species into iron(III).50,51 We suggest that the identified iron species giving rise to the R, OI, and OII signals are related to the ORR active
sites, although this is not yet unambiguously confirmed.46

The most deviating EPR spectrum was obtained
for the OTf-Fe-OMC
(green trace), which exhibits a broad, amplitude intense signal between
2500 and 3500 G (Figure 4a,b, denoted S). Interestingly, the amplitude of the S signal significantly decreases when the temperature is decreased
from 295 to 120 K but its amplitude seems to be unaffected by a change
of atmosphere. The S signal, with its temperature-dependent
behavior, is typically assigned to superparamagnetic particles.52,53 The superparamagnetic particles in OTf-Fe-OMC are consistent with
the presence of Fe1–xS54−56 and/or Fe2O3,52,53 consistent
both with the weak diffraction peaks in XRD (Figure 3d) and the XRD of the combusted OTf-Fe-OMC
sample (Figure S2). An S signal
is also observed in OAc-Fe-OMC, although with a lower signal amplitude
indicating a lower concentration of superparamagnetic species. In
the BF4-Fe-OMC and Cl-Fe-OMC catalysts, no S signal was detectable, suggesting negligible amounts of superparamagnetic
particles in these samples. Given the similar performance of Cl-Fe-OMC,
BF4-Fe-OMC, and OTf-Fe-OMC in the RDE and fuel cell tests
and the much higher iron loading obtained for OTf-Fe-OMC relative
to the other two, we suggest that the iron species giving rise to
the S signal is not related to any ORR activity. However,
some amount of active iron species must be present in the OTf-Fe-OMC
based on its performance in the fuel cell test; its OI and OII signals are, however, missing and could be obscured by the large S signal.

To summarize the EPR results, we can conclude
that the use of different
iron salts definitively influences the formation of different iron
species in the Fe-OMC catalysts. The different solubilities of the
iron salts in the carbon precursor may not necessarily increase the
iron loading in the Fe-OMCs or their performance in PEMFCs, but it
does influence the type of iron species formed. Of the identified
iron in the Fe-OMCs, some iron species are related to the ORR active
sites, whereas parts of the iron appear as superparamagnetic particles
(Fe1–xS and/or Fe2O3) that are most plausibly inactive.

Conclusions
Overall, these findings signify that the nature of the iron salt
used in the carbon synthesis has a profound influence on the structure,
chemical composition, and catalytic activity of the resultant iron/nitrogen-doped
OMCs (Fe-OMC). By changing the anion from chloride (Cl–) to one more soluble in organic media, acetate (OAc–), trifluoromethanesulfonate (OTf–), or tetrafluoroborate
(BF4–), the amount of salt in the furfurylamine
precursor solution can be dramatically increased by a factor of 5–7.
This enhanced solubility, in the case of OTf–, leads
to significantly higher iron loadings in OTf-Fe-OMC compared to Cl-Fe-OMC.
However, the higher solubility of BF4– produces an Fe-OMC with a similar iron loading to the standard chloride
salt, but with a much higher concentration of other nonvolatile elements,
which was likely formed from the BF4– counter anions. Moreover, the EPR results indicate very similar
iron species contained within BF4-Fe-OMC and Cl-Fe-OMC.
In the case of OAc-Fe-OMC, however, its final iron and nitrogen contents
were lower than for Cl-Fe-OMC, confirming the need for incorporation
of chelating heteroatoms such as nitrogen in the carbon structure
to coordinate the iron atoms.39 Most importantly,
however, the increased solubility of these salts did not produce Fe-OMCs
with noticeably better catalytic performance in the ORR in PEMFCs.
Because Cl-Fe-OMC, OTf-Fe-OMC, and BF4-Fe-OMC perform similarly,
we conclude that the different salts exhibit different selectivities
for the formation of ORR active sites; the additional iron in OTf-Fe-OMC
over Cl-Fe-OMC and BF4-Fe-OMC is apparently ORR inactive.

Nevertheless, these results highlight an opportunity for increasing
the catalytic efficiency of iron-doped carbon materials. By changing
certain synthesis conditions, e.g., the carbonization temperature,
iron salt concentration, carbon precursor, or level of nitrogen doping,
the efficiency toward the ORR could be increased. With a modified
approach, the inactive iron present in OTf-Fe-OMC could possibly form
active sites, thereby utilizing the higher solubility of the salt
to generate a higher concentration of active sites and an improved
catalytic performance for ORR.
