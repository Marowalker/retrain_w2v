A range of enantiomerically
pure protected side-chain-fluorinated
amino acids has been prepared (13 examples) by treatment of protected
amino acids containing unsaturated side chains with a combination
of Fe(III)/NaBH4 and Selectfluor. The modification of the
conditions by replacement of Selectfluor with NaN3 allowed
the preparation of side-chain azido-substituted amino acids (five
examples), which upon catalytic hydrogenation gave the corresponding
amines, isolated as lactams (four examples). Radical hydration of
the unsaturated side chains leading to side-chain-hydroxylated protected
amino acids has also been demonstrated.

Introduction
The synthesis of enantiomerically
pure amino acids continues to
attract substantial attention, and the development of new methods
for the preparation of side-chain-functionalized amino acids is the
focus of much effort.1 In particular, the
synthesis of amino acids with side-chain fluorine substitution has
been widely studied,2 specifically in the
context of the preparation of (S)-γ-fluoroleucine,
a component of the Merck Cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib.3 An early approach to (S)-γ-fluoroleucine
ethyl ester relied on the use of the Schöllkopf bis-lactim
ether.4 The synthetic routes that have
been developed more recently include the use of aspartic acid as a
chiral pool starting material,5 a titanium-catalyzed
asymmetric ene-reaction,6 use of glycine-Schiff
base alkylation followed by enzymatic resolution,7 and more recently direct photochemical fluorination of
leucine itself.8 This followed an earlier
indirect method which employed photochemical bromination of leucine,
followed by treatment with AgF.9 The latter
two approaches rely on the selective radical cleavage of the tertiary
C–H bond of leucine for their success. A complementary method
makes use of AgF/tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride as
the fluorine source, in conjunction with a manganese porphyrin catalyst.10 In previous work, we have reported a single
example of the synthesis of the γ-fluorinated cyclopentylalanine
derivative 2a using the ionic addition of hydrogen fluoride
(HF) (using HF-pyridine) to an unsaturated amino acid 1a (Scheme 1).11 This compound was a key component of a Cathepsin
S inhibitor. Although this synthetic approach was rather inefficient,
largely due to the in situ tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)-deprotection
of the substrate under the conditions of the reaction, it was nevertheless
a very considerable improvement over the previous method used for
making this protected amino acid.12

Scheme 1 Original Ionic Method for the Preparation of tert-Fluoride 2a
The report by Barker and Boger on the new radical addition
of HF
to unactivated alkenes, using Fe(III)/NaBH4, with Selectfluor
as the fluorine source,13 prompted us to
revisit our general strategy. Indeed, after we had completed the majority
of the work reported in this paper, another group reported the application
of the Barker and Boger method to the synthesis of Fmoc-(S)-γ-fluoroleucine 4 (in presumed 94% enantiomeric
excess (ee), based on the ee of the starting material), using the
2-propenylalanine derivative 3.14 We now report an in-depth study of this reaction, to assess its
generality and scope for the preparation of side-chain-fluorinated
amino acids as well as a possible extension by trapping the intermediate
alkyl radicals to allow the introduction of other functional groups
into the amino acid side chains, by exploring the use of subsequently
reported variants of the Boger process.15

Results and Discussion
Preparation of Unsaturated Amino Acids
The initial
goal was to prepare a representative selection of protected enantiomerically
pure unsaturated amino acids, with double bonds at both the γ-
and δ-positions. A range of cycloalkenylalanine derivatives
was prepared by room-temperature Negishi cross-coupling of cycloalkenyl
triflates (5a–d, 6,
and 7) with the serine-derived zinc reagent 8, according to our previously reported methods from the protected
iodoalanine derivative 9 (Scheme 2, Table 1).16 It was established
that extending the reaction times for the cross-coupling generally
resulted in higher isolated yields of the desired products (1a–d) than we had previously observed.11,16 In addition, two more functionalized vinyl triflates 6 and 7 were successfully coupled, giving the corresponding
protected amino acids 10 and 11.

Although there is less precedent
for the use of vinyl bromides
in the Negishi cross-coupling with zinc reagent 8, a
range of vinyl bromides (12–15) was
successfully coupled under the same conditions that we had employed
for coupling the vinyl triflates to give the expected unsaturated
amino acids (16–19) (Scheme 3, Table 2). The cross-coupling reactions of (E)- and (Z)-2-bromo-2-butene with zinc
reagent 8 were stereospecific, leading to the isomeric
products (E)-18 and (Z)-18, respectively. Interestingly, the use of an excess of
the commercially available isomeric mixture of 2-bromo-2-butene (E/Z,
1.9:1, as determined by 1H NMR, with both isomers used
in excess relative to zinc reagent 8) in the cross-coupling
resulted in the formation of a mixture of the products 18 that was substantially enriched in the (E)-isomer (E/Z, 7:1) (Table 2, entry 5), indicating
that the Negishi cross-coupling of the zinc reagent 8 with (E)-2-bromo-2-butene (E)-14 was faster than with (Z)-isomer 2-bromo-2-butene (Z)-14 (by a factor of 3.5). This most likely
reflects a faster rate of oxidative addition of the less hindered
(E)-isomer of compound 14 to Pd. The most notable example
was the successful cross-coupling of zinc reagent 8 with
1-bromocyclobutene 15 leading to the cyclobutenyl alanine
derivative 19, which is a rare example of the use of
1-bromocyclobutene in the Negishi cross-coupling.

A small selection of unsaturated amino acid
substrates 20–22 was prepared by
our previously reported method
using copper-catalyzed allylation of the zinc reagent 8 (Scheme 4).17 Again, we observed that extended reaction times
at room temperature resulted, in most cases, in improved yields over
those we had previously observed.

Radical Addition of HF to Unsaturated Amino Acids
Barker
and Boger’s original report contained examples of the radical
HF-addition to terminal alkenes containing an ester or a protected
amine as well as a dipeptide in which the terminal alkene was incorporated
into a tyrosine residue.13 Therefore, it
was reasonable that unsaturated amino acid substrates would also undergo
the reaction. In the event, the application of the conditions reported
by Barker and Boger to the cyclopentenylalanine derivative 1a resulted in the formation of 2a, identical to the material
we had previously prepared,11 but in substantially
higher yield (64%) and without unproductive protecting group removal
and using less toxic reagents (Scheme 5). The structure of compound 2a was confirmed
by X-ray analysis and showed a hydrogen bond from the carbamate N–H
to the carbamate carbonyl of the neighboring molecule as well as a
very distinct alignment of the C–F bond with the C–F
bond of the closest neighbor.

Scheme 5 Radical Hydrofluorination of Cyclopentenylalanine 1a
We were pleased to
find that with the exception of the 4,4-difluorocyclohexen-1-yl
alanine derivative 11 (vide infra), the procedure proved
applicable to the other substrates that we had prepared, giving the
desired HF-addition products in good to excellent yields (Table 3). To establish whether
or not the reaction proceeded without racemization, both enantiomers
of the 3-methyl-3-butenylglycine derivatives 16 and ent-16 were each separately subjected to
the radical HF-addition conditions; the products 25 and ent-25 were obtained with high ee (99 and
98%, respectively, as determined by chiral phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)), thus establishing that the reaction
did indeed proceed without racemization. When the two isomeric alkene
substrates 17 and 21 were separately subjected
to the radical HF-addition conditions, the same tert-fluoride 26 was obtained, with a slightly higher yield
from the starting material 17 with the more substituted
double bond (cf. entries 9 and 13, Table 3). When the radical HF-addition was attempted
on the 4,4-difluorocyclohexen-1-yl alanine derivative 11, the conversion was incomplete and purification difficult. We, therefore,
modified the procedure by increasing the amounts of Fe(III) and Selectfluor
and by the dropwise addition of a solution of NaBH4 (in
0.1 M NaOH) over a period of 6 h, which resulted in the isolation
of the desired product 24 in comparable yield to that
obtained with the other substrates. This modified procedure may be
successful with other more challenging substrates. The X-ray crystal
structure of compound 24 was obtained, confirming the
structure and showing similar intermolecular interactions in the solid
state to those observed in the X-ray structure of 2a.

a Reaction carried

addition of a solution of NaBH4 (in 0.1 M NaOH).

The addition of HF to the substrates 18 and 20 resulted in the formation of products 27 and 29 each with a new stereogenic center. In each case, the removal
of the Boc-protecting group with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to give
the corresponding trifluoroacetate salts, 31 and 32, followed by analysis by NMR methods established that,
in each case, the new stereogenic center had been formed with very
low diastereomeric excess (de) (specifically less than 5% de), entirely
consistent with the results of Barker and Boger.13

Radical Addition of HN3 to Unsaturated
Amino Acids
Given the efficiency of the radical addition
of HF to unsaturated
amino acids and the precedent from Leggans et al. that a combination
of Fe(III)/NaBH4 and NaN3 as the azide source
promoted the efficient radical addition of HN3 to alkenes,15 we have explored the application of this method
to the functionalization of unsaturated amino acids. The formation
of amino acids with side-chain nitrogen functionality is of interest,
since the compounds are analogues of lysine. Direct application of
the literature protocol for the hydroazidation of citronellol15 to unsaturated amino acid 16 resulted
in the incomplete conversion of the starting materials. However, a
minor modification, in which the excess of reagents was increased,
resulted in a very efficient conversion of 16 to the
corresponding tertiary azide 33. The application of this
modified method to a representative selection of unsaturated amino
acids resulted, in each case, in the formation of the expected tertiary
azide in good to excellent yields (Scheme 6, Table 4). The two isomeric alkenes 17 and 21 gave the same tertiary azide 36, with a slightly
higher yield being observed when using the more substituted alkene 17 (Scheme 7), as already observed during the HF-addition to the same substrates.

Each
of the azides 33–36 was reduced
by catalytic hydrogenation to give the corresponding free amines,
which underwent spontaneous cyclization to give the corresponding
lactams 38–41, which were each isolated
in high yields (Scheme 8, Table 5). The structure
of the lactam 40 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray
structure analysis.

Radical Alkene Hydration
The final transformation that
we briefly investigated was the radical hydration of unsaturated amino
acids using the combination of Fe(III)/NaBH4 and air as
a radical trap.15 Such a process would
lead to amino acids with a side-chain hydroxyl group. The optimization
of this particular radical addition process proved challenging and
appeared to be critically dependent on the means by which the air
was introduced into the reaction mixture. Most reliable results were
obtained when the air was introduced using a sintered gas inlet, and
in two cases (using 16 and 17 as substrates),
moderate yields of the corresponding hydroxylated amino acids were
obtained, albeit isolated as the corresponding lactone 42 in one case (Scheme 9).

Scheme 9 Radical Hydration of Unsaturated Amino Acids
Conclusions
In conclusion, the generality
and scope of the radical HF-addition
to unsaturated amino acid substrates have been established, further
demonstrating the functional group tolerance of the Boger radical
hydrofluorination process. In combination with our previously reported
methods for the preparation of unsaturated amino acids (extended to
the Negishi cross-coupling with vinyl bromides in this paper), this
constitutes an effective and direct method for the preparation of
important side-chain-fluorinated amino acid derivatives. Furthermore,
radical hydroazidation of unsaturated amino acid substrates has been
demonstrated, allowing the synthesis of side-chain amino-substituted
amino acids. Finally, radical hydration of unsaturated amino acid
substrates has been demonstrated, but further work is required to
establish the full scope of this transformation.

Experimental Section
High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) measurements were carried
out using electrospray (ES) ionization, with a time-of-flight mass
analyzer. IR spectra were recorded as thin films or using attenuated
total reflection. The synthesis of N-Boc-β-I-Ala-OMe
was accomplished by the literature methods.18 For the preparation of zinc reagent 8 and general procedures
A, B, and F, flame-dried glassware was used. Cycloalkenyl triflates 5a–d were prepared by general literature
methods19 from the corresponding ketones
and used without purification. Triflates 6,20721 and
1-cyclobutenyl bromide 15(22) were each prepared by literature methods.

Preparation of Zinc Reagent 8
Zinc powder
(3 equiv) was suspended in dry dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 mL) under
nitrogen, and iodine (nine crystals) was added immediately. A change
in color from colorless to dark brown and colorless again was observed. N-Boc-β-I-Ala-OMe 9 (1 equiv) was added
followed immediately by iodine (three crystals), the aforementioned
color change was observed once more, and the insertion process was
allowed to proceed for 30–60 min.

General Procedure A, Coupling
of 8 to Vinyl Triflates
and Halides
Immediately after the preparation of 8, Pd2(dba)3 (2.5 mol %) and SPhos (5.0 mol
%) were added to the reaction vessel along with an excess vinyl halide/triflate
(≈1.6 equiv), as indicated in the individual procedures below.
The reaction mixture was stirred under a gentle flow of nitrogen for
72 h. The reaction mixture was then filtered through a silica plug
eluting with EtOAc. The organic phase was washed with water (2 ×
50 mL) and brine (50 mL). The organic phase was dried with Na2SO4, filtered, and the solvent removed under reduced
pressure. Purification was carried out by flash column chromatography
(EtOAc in petroleum ether (40–60) mixtures over silica).

sample, and is, therefore, due to an impurity; heteronuclear single
quantum coherence analysis established that the true signal was, in
fact, obscured by the tert-butyl methyl signal.

General Procedure G, Radical Hydroxylation
The amino
acid was dissolved in MeCN (20 mL), and Fe2(ox)3 (15 wt % solution) and deionized water (18 mL) were added. The mixture
was stirred, and a flow of air passed through the solution. NaBH4 was added in eight portions with ≈2 min between each
addition. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 45 min. Conc.
NH4OH solution (4 mL) was added, and the reaction mixture
stirred for 1 min. The aqueous phase was extracted with 5% MeOH in
CH2Cl2 (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic
phases were dried with Na2SO4, filtered, and
concentrated under reduced pressure. The product was purified by flash
column chromatography (EtOAc in petroleum ether (40–60) mixtures
over silica).
