A NiOx–graphene oxide (NiOx–GO)
hybrid has been prepared by a simple
solution-processed method and was used as hole-extraction material
in perovskite solar cells with either gold or carbon as back contact
electrode. The impact of GO content on the optoelectronic behavior
of NiOx and the photovoltaic performance
of the fabricated devices has been studied. Thus, GO incorporation
showed a significant improvement in the performance of NiOx-based devices. The best attained efficiency
was 13.3%, and it was 45% higher than that with pure NiOx. This is attributed to a significant improvement
in the hole extraction, recombination resistance, and energy-level
matching in comparison to pure NiOx. In
addition, NiOx–GO/Au-based perovskite
solar cell devices showed a negligible hysteresis effect and high
reliability and repeatability. When carbon was used as back contact
electrode, the obtained efficiencies were lower, but it leaves space
for improvement. Devices based on inorganic hole transporters NiOx or NiOx–GO
demonstrated higher stability in ambient air compared to a standard
cell based on spiro-OMeTAD.

Introduction
Organometal halide perovskite solar cells
(PSCs), which is the
youngest technology in solar energy conversion, have incited very
high interest among a large number of researches by exhibiting very
high power-conversion efficiency (PCE) >22%.1 Such an amazing performance is due to the excellent optoelectronic
characteristics of the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite,
which acts as light harvester. Among these properties is its high
light absorption coefficient at room temperature, charge accumulation
in high density of states,2 very high electron–hole
diffusion lengths,3,4 no optically detectable deep states,5 and high charge-carrier mobility.6,7 Mesoscopic PSC devices are grown on a transparent electrode (usually,
fluorine-doped tin oxide, FTO) by first depositing a mesoporous scaffold
(typically, TiO2 or Al2O3), followed
by a perovskite light absorber, a high-purity organic hole-transporting
material (HTM), typically spiro-OMeTAD, and a noble metal electrode
(Au or Ag). The PSC devices with the above configuration are very
expensive because of the high cost of spiro-OMeTAD and of the noble
metal back contact. In addition to their high cost, applying metal
electrodes on PSC devices requires a high-vacuum and costly evaporation
installation, limiting their future commercial application. It is
clear that to overcome these cost-limiting problems, the expensive
components should be replaced or removed. In this respect, we have
proposed soluble n-butyl-substituted copper phthalocyanine8 and soluble tetratriphenylamine Zn phthalocyanine9 as promising soluble candidates for spiro-OMeTAD
substitution. However, it is broadly illustrated and discussed in
the literature that there are other limiting factors (besides high
cost) brought about by metal back contact and organic hole conductors
in PSCs. Thus, metal migration10 as well
as moisture- and illumination-induced degradation of organic components11 is of primary concern with PSCs. Migration of
metal inside the perovskite film can create shunt paths across the
cell and also deep trap states within the semiconductor, leading to
reduction of fill factor (FF). In addition, enhancement of nonradiative
recombination is accompanied by lower open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC).10,12 One solution to control
metal-migration-induced degradation is application of a buffer layer
between hole conductor and perovskite films.12−14 We have applied
graphene oxide (GO) buffer layer infiltrated with HTM to suppress
metal-atom penetration into the perovskite layer during aging.8 On the other hand, moisture and illumination
can drastically degrade the organic components.15 Such degradation can affect the long-term stability of
PSCs under ambient air conditions, and this constitutes the biggest
challenge faced by organic components for realistic applications of
PSC devices.16

In recent years, inorganic
carbonaceous materials have been attracting
substantial attention as promising alternatives to the organic components,
thanks to their stability, abundancy, and cost reduction of fabrication
procedure via paintable or printable depositions.7−19 Thanks to the hydrophobic nature of carbonaceous materials, they
may also discourage humidity penetration. Our concept was to replace
the unstable organic components by constructing inverted PSCs with
graphene derivatives (i.e., graphene oxide and lithium-functionalized
graphene oxide as hole- and electron-transporting layers, respectively).20,21 However, there are still other choices to make. Thus, in the present
work, we have succeeded in constructing functional cells by completely
eliminating organic hole transporters and by substituting them with
a NiOx−GO blend. The choice of
NiOx was dictated by its favorable properties.
It is a p-type semiconductor and thus may be used as hole transporter.
Its energy level is favorably located to be combined with organometal
halide perovskites (cf. Figure 1) and is easily synthesized by solution processes at low temperature;
therefore, it may be nondestructively deposited on the perovskite
film.22,23 However, its photovoltaic performance is
limited by its low intrinsic conductivity (10–4 S/cm).24 For this reason, NiOx has been, for example, doped with metals to increase its conductivity.24,25 In the present work, we have opted for NiOx−GO combinations, which proved out to be a successful choice.
The device structure was completed by a metal or a carbon back electrode.
Device construction and characterization was carried out under ambient
conditions of 28–32% relative humidity. The achieved efficiencies
were lower than those obtained with organic hole transporters. However,
all factors taken into account, the present approach might come out
to be much more realistic and thus more promising. The easiness of
cell construction, which will emerge from the present data, will by
itself bring support to this assertion.

Results and Discussion
The data listed in this work refer
to PSC devices which were made
using inorganic components with a principal role played by carbonaceous
materials. Devices were constructed and tested first using a Au and
then a carbon back contact electrode. As explained in the Experimental Procedures section, the NiOx–GO mixtures used in the present work
are abbreviated as NiOx–1GO, NiOx–2GO, NiOx–3GO, and NiOx–4GO. The
numbers in front of GO correspond to the added multiple of a unit
quantity of GO.

Figure 1 illustrates
the energy band alignment together with a schematic configuration
of the NiOx–GO-based PSC devices,
which have been studied in this work. The work function and the corresponding
energy levels of device components have been obtained in our previous
works.20,21 As shown in Figure 1a, electron–hole pairs are generated
when incident photons are absorbed by the photoactive perovskite film.
Then, electrons are transferred to the transparent FTO substrate,
whereas holes are extracted by the back Au or carbon terminals. Electron-
and hole-extraction layers (EEL and HEL, respectively) are necessary
at the interface between the perovskite film and the electrodes to
reduce the developing energy barriers and suppress interfacial charge
recombination. In addition, the output VOC is a function of the energy-level difference of electron transport
layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL). It is obvious from Figure 1b that there is a
perfect matching of the energy levels, which guarantees cell functioning.

The actual deposited materials and the formation of layers during
device construction were characterized by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The
FESEM and TEM images in Figure 2a,b, respectively, show the as-synthesized NiOx–GO hybrids. It can be seen from the FESEM
image in Figure 2a
that a heavy NiOx nanoparticles loading
on GO sheets was obtained. As revealed by the inset of Figure 2b, the sizes of the NiOx nanoparticles are in the range of 5–10
nm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping of the NiOx–GO hybrids was conducted to analyze
their chemical composition and further confirm the uniformity of the
distribution of GO carbonaceous sheets in NiOx nanoparticulate matrix. Figure 2c–e shows the distribution of Ni, O, and C elements
in the NiOx–GO blend, respectively,
indicating a satisfactory dispersion of components within the hybrid.
Crystallinity of the obtained pure NiOx and NiOx–3GO nanoparticulate
hybrids was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As
shown in Figure 2f,
both samples exhibit three main Bragg diffraction peaks at 2θ
of 37.3, 43.6, and 62.8°, which can be, respectively, assigned
to the (111), (200), and (220) planes, suggesting a cubic crystalline
structure (PDF: 47-1049). Obviously, only NiOx contributes to the detected diffraction peaks.

and EDS mapping of (c) Ni, (d) O, and
(e) C elements in the NiOx–3GO
hybrid. The scale bar is 1 μm in all EDS maps. (f) XRD patterns
of pure NiOx and NiOx–3GO hybrid films.

The morphology of the perovskite film fabricated on mesoporous
TiO2 layer is shown in Figure 3a. We can observe a continuous, flat, and
full-coverage film with large grains, which guarantee the perovskite
crystallite formation and subsequently the PSC device functioning. Figure 3b depicts a fully
covered compact structure of the NiOx–3GO
film without voids (i.e., no perovskite can be seen through this film).
This helps to control metal-migration-induced degradation, which may
damage the layer underneath by creating shunt paths between the perovskite
layer and the back contact electrodes. A typical cross-sectional FESEM
image of the PSC device is demonstrated in Figure 3c, showing a configuration of FTO/TiO2 compact layer/TiO2 mesoporous layer/perovskite
film/NiOx–3GO/Au. The most interesting
characteristic of this image is the fact that a continuous and compact
hole-extraction layer of NiOx–3GO
has been obtained, and this was achieved with a simple solution-processed
procedure.

Figure 4 shows J–V and incident photon-to-charge
carrier efficiency (IPCE) curves of PSC devices with Au back contact
electrode under both forward and reverse scans with pure NiOx and NiOx-incorporated
graphene oxide as hole-extracting layer (HEL). For the NiOx–3GO/Au-based device, a PCE of 13.3%
was obtained under forward scan, where JSC, VOC, and FF were 20.4 mA/cm2, 1.03 V, and 0.63, respectively. However, the control device with
pure NiOx/Au layer exhibited a JSC of 19.0 mA/cm2, a VOC of 0.95 V, and a FF of 0.51, resulting in a PCE of
9.2% under forward scan. It is noteworthy that the NiOx/Au-based device demonstrated a serious hysteresis
effect, which may be attributed to the inefficient hole extraction
from the perovskite film to the NiOx layer.
However, in the presence of GO, such obstacles were overcome so that
the NiOx–GO/Au-based PSC devices
had a negligible hysteresis effect, indicating that the GO sheets
markedly improved the charge-collection capacity.

layers: (a) Current density–voltage (J–V) curves under forward and reverse scans and (b) incident
photon-to-carrier efficiency spectra (left ordinate) and photocurrent
density (right ordinate) calculated by integrating the corresponding
IPCE spectra under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight.

Corresponding photovoltaic characteristics of the cells made
by
using carbon as back contact electrode are presented in Figure 5 and Tables 1 and 2. All photovoltaic
parameters reached lower values than in the case of gold. Especially,
the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage suffered large losses.
This lower performance is due to different conductive characteristics
of carbon compared to gold, as well as to the porous structure of
the carbon layer. However, we believe that this is a matter of optimization
and therefore there is room for improvement.

To better understand hole-extraction functionality by the NiOx–GO layer, UV–vis and photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of the perovskite films on NiOx and NiOx–GO layers deposited
on FTO substrates were studied and are presented in Figure 6. The UV–vis absorption
spectra (Figure 6a)
show a much higher absorbance in the range of 400–750 nm for
NiOx and NiOx–GO-containing films, compared to neat perovskite as reference
sample. The corresponding steady-state photoluminescence spectra,
illustrated in Figure 4b, show a perovskite film luminescence peak at 709 nm. In the presence
of NiOx, photoluminescence was substantially
quenched, indicating charge transfer between NiOx and perovskite photoactive layer. It is interesting to
note that photoluminescence quenching was even more extensive in the
presence of GO. These data then indicate that charge transfer between
the photoactive layer and the hole-extracting layer is effective and
it is even more so in the presence of GO.

Figure 6 (a) UV–vis absorption
and (b) photoluminescence spectra
of the perovskite films on NiOx and NiOx–GO layers deposited on FTO substrates.
Photoluminescence was recorded by excitation at 450 nm.

An obvious question may then be asked as to the
nature of the support
brought about by the presence of GO. Both NiOx and GO are not thermally treated; therefore, NiOx exact stoichiometry cannot be assured and GO is not transformed
into reduced graphene oxide. Thus, the presence of GO cannot offer
higher conductivities to the layer. This matter has been studied by
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Figure 7 shows EIS data and
the insets present the equivalent circuit models. By fitting Nyquist
plots, the total series resistance (Rs) of the devices was calculated to be around 11 Ω. The closeness
in Rs values in all devices was due to
the similar device structure, as shown in Figure 1. However, an obvious difference was observed
with the charge-transfer resistance (Rt) values at the ETL/perovskite or HTL/perovskite interface between
devices made with neat NiOx and devices
made with the optimal NiOx−GO layer
(i.e., NiOx–3GO). Figure 7a shows the corresponding Nyquist
plots under dark and at a bias of VOC,
exhibiting internal charge transport and recombination through the
PSC devices. Only one semicircle could be distinguished in the Nyquist
plots, attributed to charge-transfer resistance (Rt) at the interface between NiOx or NiOx–GO and perovskite film.
The NiOx–GO-based PSC devices had
lower Rt, i.e., smaller semicircle, than
the control device with neat NiOx as HTL.
The smaller Rt implies a faster charge
transport at the interface of HEL/perovskite. This result confirms
the conclusions drawn by the above photoluminescence measurements,
as shown in Figure 6b. Nyquist plots of the cells measured under AM 1.5G illumination
conditions and the equivalent circuit are shown in Figure 7b, where both high- and low-frequency
semicircles become evident. The high-frequency part of the spectra
contains information on charge-transfer resistance (Rt) and series resistance (Rs) elements, as well as dielectric contributions.26 The low frequency arc is attributed to recombination resistance
(Rr) at the photoactive layer.27 By fitting the Nyquist plot with an equivalent
circuit, the NiOx–GO-based device
shows a smaller value of Rt and a larger
value of Rr (i.e., interfacial recombination
resistance). The more efficient hole-extraction process from perovskite
photoactive layer and the more efficient suppressing of charge recombination
in the case of NiOx–GO-based PSC
device resulted in a better device performance, compared to the neat
NiOx-based device. To answer then the
question at the beginning of this paragraph, we may conclude that
the presence of GO does not support higher conductivity, thus leaving
series resistance unaffected, but offering a better structural organization
of the HEL facilitates charge transfer while impeding charge recombination.

plots and equivalent circuits for fitting the EIS data
of the NiOx- and the NiOx–GO-based PSC devices measured under (a) dark and
(b) AM 1.5G illumination conditions with a bias voltage of VOC. The solid lines are the fitted curves. On
the transmission line equivalent circuit used to fit the impedance
data, Rs represents the resistance of
conductive substrate, CBL is the capacitance, RBL is the charge-transfer resistance at TiO2 compact blocking layer, Rt is
the transport resistance at the ETL/perovskite or the HTL/perovskite
interface, Rr is the recombination resistance
accounting for losses of electrons from perovskite absorber layer, Cμ is the chemical capacitance, and RHTL is the resistance of NiOx or NiOx–GO as hole-transporting
materials.

The photoconversion efficiency
vs time curves for the corresponding
PSC devices based on spiro-OMeTAD (as reference standard HTL) and
for the above NiOx and NiOx–3GO devices with either Au or carbon back
contact electrodes are compared in Figure 8. The devices were kept in a dry box of relative
humidity 28–32% under dark conditions and then their photovoltaic
performance was measured at different time intervals under ambient
air at room temperature. Comparison of performance of different HTL
components indicated that the photoconversion efficiency of the spiro-based
PSCs underwent intensive more rapid deterioration in a period of a
few days and reached nearly a dead point, with only 14% of its initial
PCE remaining, after 15 days of device operation. During the same
period of time, the NiOx–3GO component
significantly delayed the photoinduced degradation, thereby retaining
about 72% (carbon electrode) and 57% (Au electrode) of the initial
photoconversion efficiency after 15 days of device operation. It is
noteworthy that in the beginning of the aging test spiro-based device
exhibited 27% higher PCE than the best-performance device based on
NiOx–3GO. But after about 6 days
of their initial operations, they had the same PCE of 11.2% and then
the inorganic-based PSC showed a better performance. This indicates
that the oxygen and moisture apparently deteriorate all fabricated
PSC devices, but those with NiOx HTL show
distinctly more stable behavior, especially in the presence of graphene
oxide. This may be attributed to the good shielding role of NiOx–GO hybrids against the penetration of
humidity into the highly sensitive perovskite layer under ambient
conditions.

Figure 8 Photoconversion efficiency as a function of aging time of PSC devices
based on spiro-OMeTAD, NiOx, and NiOx–3GO as hole-extraction layers with Au
and carbon back contacts.

One more interesting point in Figure 8 is the impact of back contact electrode
material on long-term stability of PSCs. If we consider a certain
HTL (NiOx or NiOx–3GO) with different carbon and Au back contact electrodes,
it is not surprising that Au caused more rapid deterioration of PCE
than carbon back contact. Metal can migrate inside the perovskite
film during device operation and create shunt paths across the cell.10 This seems to be less probable in the case of
carbon. In addition, carbon layer adds to the protective effect brought
about by its hydrophobic nature.

Conclusions
Perovskite
solar cells have been constructed using solution-processable
inorganic components with NiOx−GO
blends making the hole-extraction layer. Devices have been made and
characterized under ambient conditions of 28–32% relative humidity.
The obtained maximum efficiency was lower than the values reported
with organic hole-transporting materials; however, with all factors
taken into account, the proposed route might come out to be much more
realistic and thus more promising. Moreover, these devices showed
a higher stability in ambient air compared to a standard PSC device
based on spiro-OMeTAD. Devices have been constructed by easy procedures,
and this is particularly true for the deposition of the NiOx−GO layer, which was functional despite
the simplicity of synthesis and deposition. GO does not increase conductivity
as has been observed with metal-doped NiOx, but its presence apparently helps to organize the hole-extraction
layer and thus increase its functionality.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
unless otherwise specified, and used as received. SnO2:F
transparent conductive substrates (FTO, resistance 7 Ω/square)
(TCO22-7) and carbon paste were purchased from Solaronix. Commercial
Degussa P25 was used for the preparation of homemade TiO2 paste used for the deposition of the mesoporous titania layer.

Preparation of GO, NiOx, and NiOx–GO
Full details of GO synthesis
have been reported in our previous work.28 Briefly, GO was synthesized on the basis of the Hummers and Offeman
method,29 involving two steps: preoxidation
of graphite flakes and exfoliation of graphene oxide. In the first
step, K2S2O8 and P2O5 were utilized as oxidizing agent of graphite flakes in concentrated
H2SO4 at 80 °C. In the second step, the
above oxidized graphite powder underwent progressive oxidation and
exfoliation using KMnO4 and NaNO3 in a cooled
H2SO4 bath. Deionized water was added into the
mixture to increase the oxidation degree of the GO product. Residual
oxidizing agents were dissolved with 30% H2O2. The gross product was treated with 10% HCl solution in ethanol
and deionized water to eliminate the residual metal ions. The yellow-brown
GO dispersion was then subjected to dialysis to completely remove
metal ions and acids. Finally, it was dehydrated in an air oven to
yield the GO powder. In the next step, a dispersion of the GO sheets
in isopropanol and glacial acetic acid with a concentration of 5 mg/mL
were prepared using an ultrasonic bath. The resultant homogeneously
exfoliated suspensions were used as graphene source to synthesize
NiOx–graphene oxide (NiOx–GO) hybrids via a simple solution-processed
method as follows. Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 1.5 g) was added to 50 mL of
isopropanol and stirred overnight. The resultant green NiOx precursor solution was filtered using a porous
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) membrane filter (0.45 μm). To prepare
NiOx–GO hybrids with different
contents of GO, four different amounts (1, 2, 3, and 4 mL) of the
above prepared GO dispersion were added dropwise into 10 mL of NiOx precursor solution in isopropanol under stirring,
followed by 10 min sonication. The obtained NiOx–GO mixtures are abbreviated as NiOx–1GO, NiOx–2GO,
NiOx–3GO, and NiOx–4GO, respectively. The numbers in front of GO correspond
to the added amounts (mL) of GO dispersion, and because the content
of the latter in GO was 5 mg/mL, it is expected that the quantity
of GO in the mixture was equal to the corresponding multiples of 5
mg (i.e., 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg, respectively).

Construction of PSC Devices
FTO-coated glass substrates
were cut in pieces of dimensions 1 cm × 3 cm. One-third of the
conductive layer was etched using zinc powder and hydrochloric acid.
They were washed with mild detergent, rinsed several times with distilled
water and subsequently with ethanol and acetone in an ultrasonic bath,
and finally dried under air stream. A compact thin layer of TiO2 was then deposited on this patterned and cleaned FTO electrode
by aerosol spray pyrolysis using a solution of 0.2 M diisopropoxytitanium
bis(acetylacetonate) in ethanol. After spraying, the samples were
dried for 10 min at 100 °C and heated for 1 h at 500 °C.
Subsequently, a mesoporous TiO2 layer was spin-coated at
4000 rpm for 60 s using a TiO2 paste made of P25 nanoparticles.
The obtained film was dried at 100 °C for 20 min and calcined
for 30 min at 500 °C. After that, the samples were treated in
TiCl4 by dipping into a solution made of 0.04 M TiCl4 in H2O for 30 min at 70 °C, then copiously
rinsing, and finally calcining at 500 °C. Active perovskite layer
was deposited on mesoporous TiO2 film by the following
procedure. PbI2 (507 mg) and PbCl2 (253 mg)
were dissolved in 1.5 mL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 170 °C.
After cooling at room temperature, 270 mg of methyl ammonium iodide
was added under stirring. The solution was kept under stirring for
about 2 h at about 80 °C and then deposited by two consecutive
spin-coating steps: first 1000 rpm for 10 s and then 6000 rpm for
30 s. During the second step, 1 mL of chlorobenzene, as an antisolvent,
was gently dropped on the spinning substrate. The layer was then heated
at 90 °C for about 45 min, which made the sample’s color
turn from yellow to black. Thereafter, NiOx or NiOx–GO as hole-extraction
layer was spin-coated from its stock solution at 3000 rpm for 40 s
directly on the annealed perovskite layer at room temperature, followed
by heating at 100 °C for 10 min. All procedures were carried
out under ambient conditions of 28–32% relative humidity. The
last step for preparing the PSC devices was the deposition of back
contact electrode. Two different procedures and materials were used
for this purpose. First, 90 nm thick gold electrodes were deposited
by thermal evaporation under vacuum. In the second case, carbon electrodes
were constructed by screen-printing a commercial carbon paste on NiOx or NiOx–GO
layers and dried at 100 °C for 10 min. Two unit devices were
made in each case with an active size of 15 mm2 (10 mm
× 1.5 mm) as defined by the size of gold or carbon electrodes.

Characterization and Measurements
The size and morphology
of NiOx nanoparticles blended with GO
sheets were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM/JEOL,
JEM-2100, Japan) operating at 200 kV. Solar cell devices configuration
and subsequent layers’ morphology were imaged by means of field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, MIRA3 TESCAN, Czech
Republic) with a field emission gun equipped with an energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry (EDS) system. The UV–vis absorbance properties
of mesoporous layers were recorded using an AVASPEC-2048-TEC instrument
(Avantes, The Netherlands). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded
on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer. The photovoltaic parameters
of the PSC devices were studied using a Zahner Cimps PCS solar simulator
(Zahner, Kronach, Germany) set at 100 mW/cm2. The devices
were illuminated through a mask of aperture size 1 mm × 6 mm
under ambient conditions at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. Incident photon-to-charge
carrier efficiency (IPCE) was obtained using a setup with a Jarrell-Ash
monochromator, a 100 W halogen lamp, and a calibrated photodiode (Thorlabs).
Electronic impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization was carried
out with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT128N, Autolab B.V., The
Netherlands) under both dark and AM 1.5G illuminated conditions at
a frequency range of 1 Hz to 3 MHz.
