The
catalytic potential of palladium(II) complexes with chelating N-phosphanyl-N-heterocyclic carbenes featuring
a saturated imidazolin-2-ylidene or tetrahydropyrimid-2-ylidene ring
has been investigated in intermolecular alkyne hydroamination reactions.
The complexes were found to be among the most active Pd-based catalysts
for these processes and to enable the use of low reaction temperatures
(40 °C) and of solventless conditions. The Pd complexes require
activation by 2 equiv of a silver salt to remove chlorido ligands
from the metal coordination sphere; they can however also be presynthesized
in active form, which allows their use under silver-free conditions.
The hydroamination reaction was found to efficiently proceed with
terminal alkynes and different ring-substituted, primary arylamine
substrates.

Introduction
The addition of molecules containing an
N–H function across
multiple C–C bonds of unsaturated organic molecules, commonly
termed hydroamination, is a very useful synthetic tool for the preparation
of complex nitrogen-containing compounds, including, for example,
nitrogen heterocycles featured in several pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals
of technological interest.1,2 This reaction is generally
run under organometallic catalysis, as at least one of the reaction
partners, the N–H containing substrate or the unsaturated substrate,
needs to be activated for reaction in order to overcome the electronic
repulsion between the C–C multiple bond and the nitrogen-containing
functional group, which are both electron-rich moieties. Whereas hard
metal centers preferentially coordinate and activate the N–H
group, soft ones, typically late-transition metals, interact instead
preferentially with the π system of the unsaturated substrate,
depleting its electron density and favoring nucleophilic attack by
the N–H moiety;1−3 the lower oxophilicity of late transition metal centers
renders them also more tolerant toward functional groups present in
the substrates. Although gold-based catalysts for this reaction class
have become increasingly popular in the course of the last two decades,2,4 other late transition metals, in particular group 10 metals such
as Pd and Pt,5−12 have been intensively investigated as well; palladium species that
have been successfully employed as catalyst include simple palladium(II)
salts and also palladium(II) complexes, such as the Pd(II) complexes
with N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands successfully
tested by several research groups.9−11,13

In recent years, we14,15 and others16,17 have reported on Pd complexes with a novel class of ligands, namely,
stable carbene ligands N-functionalized with a phosphanyl moiety (Scheme 1). Such ligands,
termed N-phosphanyl-N-heterocyclic
carbenes (NHCPs) or N-phosphanyl acyclic diaminocarbenes,
have been extensively investigated as catalysts for cross-coupling
reactions.14,15 They were found to exhibit a
high reactivity toward unreactive aryl chlorides but also to undergo
decomposition in the course of the reaction. This instability has
been tentatively attributed to the fact that these complexes feature
small bite angle chelating ligands, which give rise to stable square
planar complexes with palladium(II) but do not fit well in the tetrahedral
coordination geometry of palladium(0); as the catalytic cycle for
cross-coupling reactions relies on a Pd(0)/Pd(II) manifold and expectedly
produces palladium(0) complexes, these complexes will be prone to
ligand dissociation and decomposition. Consequently, in the frame
of this work, we have extended our investigation on the catalytic
performance of palladium(II) complexes with NHCP ligands to the intermolecular
hydroamination of alkynes, which is generally considered to be a redox-neutral
process under Pd catalysis (Figure 1).2

Results and Discussion
In order to assess the catalytic
potential of complexes with N-phosphanyl carbenes
for hydroamination reactions, we have
considered complexes 1–2, featuring
a saturated imidazolin-2-ylidene or tetrahydropyrimid-2-ylidene ring,
which were previously reported and thoroughly characterized by us14 (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Complexes 1–2
Mes = mesityl; BN = benzonitrile.

Catalytic tests were run on the hydroamination
of phenylacetylene
with an aromatic primary amine such as mesitylamine (Scheme 3), and were aimed at establishing
the best reaction conditions, particularly in terms of solvent and
employed cocatalyst. Indeed, the palladium(II) complexes have to be
activated for reaction upon removal of the chlorido ligands from their
coordination sphere, which generates the catalytically competent,
formally dicationic complex (Figure 1); no reaction is observed employing the starting palladium(II)
complexes alone as catalyst. We purposely chose a notoriously rather
difficult amine substrate for hydroamination reactions, such as the
rather sterically encumbered mesitylamine, in order to have an engaging
test reaction against which to optimize our catalytic system. The
reaction produced the Markovnikov hydroamination product exclusively,
as it is commonly the case with group 10 and 11 metal catalysts.2

Scheme 3 General Hydroamination Reaction Investigated
in This Study
We performed first
some blank experiments in acetonitrile in order
to ascertain whether the silver salt cocatalyst could promote the
reaction by itself, as there have been reports in the literature that
hydroamination can be also catalyzed by Ag salts.18 Under the reaction conditions employed herein, though,
the Ag salt alone was a poorly effective catalyst for hydroamination
(4% yield), whereas it appeared a bit more active for alkyne hydration
by traces of water introduced together with the silver salt; indeed,
yields in acetophenone (the product of phenylacetylene hydration)
were variable (1–10%) and correlated with the hygroscopicity
of the silver salt.

Next, we evaluated the effect of different
solvents on the reaction
outcome using catalyst 1 (Table 1). As it is apparent from the table, the
catalytic system exhibits a fair performance in acetonitrile, whereas
a more coordinating solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) suppresses
catalytic activity. Activity in a less-coordinating, less-polar solvent
such as toluene is also low, possibly because of poor solubility of
the dicationic catalyst in this solvent. Use of a standard ionic liquid
such as 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
as solvent enhances the catalytic performance, and even better results
can be obtained with no solvent at all. It is interesting to remark
that under neat condition the extent of formation of acetophenone
(the hydration product) is lower than in organic solvents at comparable
conversion, but there is a somewhat higher consumption of alkyne in
competitive polymerization reactions, which decreases the reaction
selectivity. Concerning the formation of the hydration product, control
experiments performed without addition of the amine substrate in acetonitrile/water
20:1 have demonstrated that the activity of the palladium catalysts
for the direct phenylacetylene hydration reaction is negligible, and
consequently that acetophenone is mainly formed upon hydrolysis of
the imine produced upon hydroamination.

Having established that our catalysts allow to carry
out an intermolecular
alkyne hydroamination reaction under very sustainable conditions (neat
conditions, stoichiometric quantities of the two reagents, 1 mol %
catalyst), we then turned to the evaluation of the nature and amount
of the silver salt cocatalyst on the catalytic performance (Table 2). Reactions were
carried out using catalyst 1 in combination with different
silver salts, both in acetonitrile (Table 2, entries 1–6) and under neat conditions
(Table 2 entries 7–9);
under the latter conditions, catalyst 2 was investigated
as well (Table 2, entries
10–13).

The nature of the employed silver
salt was found to have little
influence on the yield in addition products (hydroamination + hydroamination-derived
hydration), whereas it seems to have an influence on the overall conversion
of the alkyne reagent, which is however difficult to rationalize.
Thus, the yield in addition products appears to be quite insensitive
to the different coordinating ability and Brønstedt basicity
of the employed anions. This is important for an understanding of
the reaction mechanism, as it suggests that the counteranion is not
involved in the rate-determining step of the catalytic process, as
it is has been found to be the case, for example, in related gold(I)-catalyzed
reactions such as alkyne hydroalkoxylation,19 and hydration.20 It could be argued with
reason that it is not so meaningful to draw kinetic inferences from
reaction yields measured after a 24 h reaction time, as they could
also more simply reflect the lack of influence of the counteranion
on the stability of the catalyst. However, as it will be apparent
below, additional experiments at a shorter reaction time support the
former interpretation. Interestingly, conversions and yields decrease
significantly when only 1 equiv of silver salt is employed as cocatalyst
(Table 2, entry 5),
whereas they remain largely unaffected when an excess of silver salt
cocatalyst is present (Table 2, entries 2, 11, and 13). This result highlights once more
the importance of catalyst activation by the silver salt as well as
the negligible role of silver(I) centers in the catalytic event.

A limitation of the use of these catalysts is represented by the
need for the silver salt cocatalyst to activate the Pd complex, which
complicates the setup of the reaction and often causes unwanted formal
alkyne hydration as side reaction because of the hygroscopic nature
of the silver salt. Finally, it has been sometimes claimed that silver
can interfere with the catalytic process (the so-called “silver
effect”) not only by being catalytically active in its own
right but also by assisting the catalytically competent centers.21 In order to evaluate this effect, we set out
to preform complexes with less coordinating counteranions. Anion exchange
with the corresponding silver salt in acetonitrile serves well for
this purpose, and it allows to isolate the complexes as analytically
pure compounds (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Preparation of Silver-Free Pd Complexes for Hydroamination
Catalysis
The complexes 1–SbF6, 2–OTf, and 2–SbF6 turned out
to be fairly stable and could be stored
for weeks in the solid state under air without noticeable decomposition.
The reactivity of these complexes has been extensively evaluated and
the results are reported in Table 3.

Generally speaking,
the catalytic performance of preformed catalysts
in terms of yield of hydroamination product is comparable to (in the
case of complex 1) or lower than (in the case of complex 2) that of systems formed in situ, which again rules out a
possible catalytic role of the introduced Ag(I) beside halide removal
from Pd, at least in the case of complex 1. The extent
of formation of the formal alkyne hydration product is decreased,
as expected, as no hygroscopic silver salt is introduced in the system.
Furthermore, the nature of the counteranion seems to play no role,
which confirms our findings reported in Table 2 using silver salts. Altogether, use of preactivated,
silver-free catalysts appears to bring no significant advantage in
the reaction outcome; hence, in the following, catalysts activated
in situ by addition of silver salt have been employed.

We then
considered the effect of changes in the reaction time and
temperature on the outcome of the reaction (Table 4). We first established that 25 h of reaction
time was not necessary in order to reach good hydroamination yields,
and that respectable amounts of imine product were produced already
after only 4 h of reaction time (Table 4, entries 1–5). Furthermore, use of silver triflate
or hexafluoroantimonate as catalyst activator has a slight effect
on the conversion of alkyne and on the incidence of formal alkyne
hydration (probably due to the higher hygroscopicity of the hexafluoroantimonate
salt) but not on the yield in the hydroamination product, which remains
the same irrespective of the silver salt employed (Table 4, entries 2 and 3); this corroborates
our previous assumption about the negligible influence of the nature
of the non-coordinating anion on the performance of the catalyst.

Gratifyingly, significant catalytic
activity was recorded with
both complexes also at 40 °C (Table 4, entries 6–9), which to the best
of our knowledge represents the lowest temperature ever reported for
an intermolecular alkyne hydroamination reaction promoted by a Pd-based
catalyst. Furthermore, comparing the performance of our catalysts
with that of other NHC–Pd catalysts previously reported in
the literature for the same reaction,9−11 it is evident that the
latter require significantly higher temperatures, in the range 100–120
°C, as well as an excess of alkyne (1.2–2 equiv) in order
to operate efficiently, which highlights the advantage of using our
compounds.

The results of the tests reported in Table 4 allow also to make a comparison
between
the performances of catalysts 1 and 2. A
pictorial view of the same data is reported in the graph in Figure 2. It can be appreciated
that at a lower temperature (40 °C) catalyst 1 appears
slightly more active than catalyst 2 at the beginning
of the reaction and that both catalysts remain active for several
hours. On the other hand, at 80 °C catalytic activity decreases
markedly for both catalysts after the first hours of reaction, and
the decrease is much more pronounced for catalyst 1 compared
to catalyst 2. We conclude that catalyst 1 is a more active catalyst for the intermolecular alkyne hydroamination
reaction, but at the same time it is also less stable under the reaction
conditions, especially at a higher temperature. The reason for this
lower stability, which has been recorded also using the same complexes
as catalysts for cross-coupling reactions, is in our opinion explained
by the more strained nature of the chelate ring in complex 1 compared to complex 2.14

Figure 2 Graphic
representation of the catalytic performance of complexes 1 and 2.

Finally, the generality of the intermolecular alkyne hydroamination
reaction employing catalysts 1 and 2 has
been evaluated with several different alkynes and aromatic amines.
The yields in hydroamination product are reported in Table 5; they have been recorded after
a 4 h reaction time at 80 °C and are therefore not optimized.
It can be appreciated that the reactivity of the two Pd complexes
is not limited to phenylacetylene and mesitylamine; other terminal
alkynes and differently ring-substituted primary arylamines can be
employed. Yields are somewhat lower with the p-substituted anilines
compared with mesitylamine, and are found not to significantly depend
on the nature of the para-substituent. This suggests that the electronic
properties of the amine do not influence the reaction yield to a great
extent, whereas steric effects are more important; possibly the steric
bulk of the amine promotes faster protonolysis of the vinylpalladium
intermediate and/or dissociation of the coordinated enamine product,
thereupon accelerating the reaction. On the other hand, the reaction
fails altogether when internal alkynes (such as phenylpropyne) or
secondary arylamines (such as N-methylaniline) are
employed as substrates. Consequently, the substrate scope of these
catalysts appears somewhat narrower compared with the Pd complex with
an iminophosphane ligand recently reported by us,12 which exhibits notable reactivity also with internal alkynes.

Conclusions
NHCP
palladium(II) complexes 1 and 2 have
been found to be among the most active Pd-based catalysts reported
to date for the intermolecular hydroamination of alkynes. Use of these
catalysts enables the use of low reaction temperatures (40 °C)
and of solventless conditions, and allows to carry out the reaction
with stoichiometric quantities of the reagents, thus rendering the
whole process very sustainable. The complexes can be activated in
situ by addition of 2 equiv of a silver salt, or prepared in advance
in active, silver-free form. Finally, the complexes were able to activate
terminal alkynes and different ring-substituted primary arylamine
substrates for the reaction. Work in progress aims at extending the
application of these complexes as catalysts to other reactions, and
to further optimize the catalytic performance of the complexes by
acting on the NHCP ligand structure.

Experimental Section
All manipulations of air- and moisture-sensitive compounds were
carried out using standard Schlenk techniques or in a glovebox under
an atmosphere of dinitrogen. The reagents were purchased from Aldrich
as high-purity products and generally used as received. All solvents
were purified and dried by standard methods. Nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE spectrometers working
at 300 MHz (300.1 MHz for 1H, 75.5 MHz for 13C, and 121.5 MHz for 31P); chemical shifts (δ) are
reported in units of ppm relative to the residual solvent signals
and to external 85% H3PO4 (for 31P). Elemental analyses were carried out with a Fisons EA 1108 CHNS–O
apparatus or with a Carlo Erba analyzer.

Synthesis of Catalysts 1–SbF6, 2–OTf, 2–SbF6
Complex 1 or 2 (50 mg) was placed in a Schlenk tube under
an inert atmosphere and
dissolved in 2 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile. A solution of 2 equiv
silver(I) triflate or hexafluoroantimonate in 2 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile
was added in one portion, and the resulting mixture was stirred at
room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was filtered over
Celite and the resulting clear solution was evaporated to dryness.
The product was washed with diethylether and dried under vacuum. Isolated
yields were in the range 45–55%.

General Procedure for Catalytic
Hydroaminations
In
a Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic stirring bar were placed under
an inert atmosphere 10 μmol Pd complex and optionally 20–80
μmol silver salt cocatalyst. The tube was degassed and put under
an inert atmosphere. Aniline (1.00 mmol), 1.00 mmol alkyne, and optionally
1 mL of dry solvent were then injected into the Schlenk tube. The
flask was immediately placed in an oil bath preheated at the reaction
temperature and the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred for the
given reaction time. Conversions and yields were determined as the
average of two runs by 1H NMR. 1,4-Bis-trimethylsilylbenzene
(22 mg 0.10 mmol) was dissolved as an internal standard in the reaction
mixture and a sample thereof was diluted in CDCl3 for the
measurement.
