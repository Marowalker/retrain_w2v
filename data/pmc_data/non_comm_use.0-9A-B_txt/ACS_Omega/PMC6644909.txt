Molecule/protein
aggregation causes many devastating and incurable
diseases in human bodies. For example, studies have revealed that
protein oligomers formed at the early stage are toxic and may be mostly
responsible for some diseases. In the fundamental research, differentiation
of different protein oligomers and quantification of the concentrations
are important and challenging. Here, we have developed a multichannel
time-tagged time-resolved (TTTR) confocal fluorescence model based
on antibunching effect to solve the problem. The key point of the
model is that n-oligomers labeled with n-dyes cannot emit more than n photons at one time.
By assuming that all labeling dyes behave perfectly as noninteractive
individual dyes, the analytic relationship between photon-emission
probability and oligomer concentrations has been derived. Simulations
have been carried out to verify the model, in which differentiation
and concentration quantification of up to tetraoligomers can be realized
with a relative error <10% in an eight-channel TTTR confocal setup
with eight single-photon detectors.

1 Introduction
Molecule
aggregation is a usually observed phenomenon in solutions,
which is important in life sciences. For example, aggregation of proteins
is related to a wide variety of human diseases.1−4 Understanding the aggregation
process is of fundamental importance. However, there is a challenge
in precise differentiation of different oligomer aggregates and accurate
quantification of the concentrations. Many offline methods have been
used to differentiate different oligomers, such as polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis,5,6 capillary electrophoresis,7,8 and thioflavin T fluorescent method.9−11 Fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy (FCS) can also gain information about the size of species
in solution.12,13 However, FCS has a limited size
resolution and usually yields average hydrodynamic size for a population
of aggregates. Photon count histogram14 method and burst analysis15 are oligomer
quantification methods based on fluorescence brightness analysis.
Dual-foci FCS can also be used to analyze the absolute diffusion size
of molecules/particles.16 Fluorescence-detection-based
flow cytometry also can quantify particle size with high throughput.17 Here, we propose an alternative model to quantify
concentrations of different oligomers on the basis of fluorescence
antibunching effect18−21 by assuming no interaction (such as energy/charge transfer, singlet-to-triplet-conversion,
photobleaching, and so on) among the labeling dyes within the same
oligomers. The model employs multichannel time-tagged and time-resolved
(TTTR) confocal fluorescence measurement similar to that in the previous
report.22 Simulations have been carried
out for concentration quantification for up to tetraoligomers using
an eight-channel TTTR setup with eight single-photon detectors.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Model
In this
model, a multichannel
TTTR confocal experiment configuration with a pulsed laser (pulse
much shorter than the fluorescence lifetime of the labeling dyes)
is used (shown in Figure 1). A monomer labeled with one dye molecule cannot emit more
than one photon after one pulsed excitation, while n-oligomer (labeled with n number of dye molecules)
can emit no more than n photons after one pulsed
excitation. That is, in our model, all labeling dyes are assumed to
behave as individual unperturbed single-photon emitters. Besides,
photobleaching is also not considered. Note that there are many exceptions.
Experimentally, antibunching effect has also been observed for closely
packed oligomers/aggregates because of complicated excited-state interactions
among dyes within the same oligomers/aggregates,23−28 including energy transfer, electron transfer, singlet-to-triplet-conversion,
singlet–singlet annihilation, singlet–triplet annihilation,
and so on. Therefore, the model presented in this report has its limitations.

Figure 1 Illustration
of a multichannel TTTR confocal setup and photon emission
from a monomer and a dimer excited by laser pulses.

By assuming Gaussian point spread function for
the confocal system,
during one excitation period, the probability for the dye tagged on
a monomer i to emit one photon, pi, is29−31 1  where (xi, yi, zi) is the location of the monomer i, and wxy and wz represent the radii in x–y plane and z direction of the point spread function of the confocal system, respectively.  is the effective confocal volume. I0,i represents the fluorescence
intensity of the molecule in the center of the confocal volume. I0,i is related to laser power,
molecular absorption cross section, quantum yield, and collection
efficiency of the instrument (see the Supporting Information (SI) for details).

For a solution with only N1 number
of monomers, the probability of emitting one photon in one excitation
period, P1, can be written as 2  where i and j denote different monomer molecules.

As the time
interval among neighboring pulses (for example, ∼100
ns for an excitation repetition rate of 10 MHz) is much shorter than
the diffusion time of molecules (∼ms), the positions of oligomers
in a few consecutive pulses are approximately the same. Then, photon-emission
probability in consecutive pulses can be written out. For example,
the probability of emitting one photon in the first excitation and
no photon emission in the second pulse, P1,0, can be written as 3  Since all molecules have the same probability
to appear at any location in the solution, the time-averaged single-photon-emission
probabilities P̅1 and P̅1,0 are equal to the space-averaged emission probability,i.e., 4  where V is the volume of
the sample cell. Since the volume of the sample cell V is usually much larger than the effective confocal volume V0, the number of monomers in the sample volume
is much larger than in the confocal volume. Then, 5  NA is the Avogadro
constant, c1 is the concentration of the
monomer, and . P̅0 and P̅0,0 represent the probabilities of no
photon emission in one pulse and in two consecutive pulses, respectively. P̅0 and P̅0,0 are written as 6  For a mixture of monomers and dimers
with
molecule numbers of N1 and N2, respectively, P̅1, P̅1,0, and P̅2 (average probabilities for two-photon emission in one
excitation) can be written as 7  where c2 is the
concentration of the dimer and .

In the same manner, for a mixture of monomers, dimers, trimers,
and tetramers with molecule numbers of N1, N2, N3,
and N4, respectively, the photon-emission
probabilities can be derived. 8  where c3 and c4 are the concentrations of trimers
and tetramers,
respectively, and , . Theoretically, photon-emission probabilities
for oligomers larger than tetramers can also be derived. However,
it is more complex. Therefore, here we limit aggregations up to tetraoligomers
for simplicity.

Photon-emission probabilities P̅0, P̅1, P̅2, P̅3, P̅4, P̅00, and P̅10 can all be measured from multichannel
TTTR confocal fluorescence experiments via the below equations 9   10  where Mn is the number of pulses with
the photon-emission number of n, M1,0 is the number of two
consecutive pulses with one photon emission in the first pulse and
no photon emission in the second pulse, t is the
measurement time, and f is the laser excitation frequency.
Then, by solving eq 8, oligomer concentrations c1, c2, c3, and c4 can be obtained.

For the channel number
of TTTR single-photon recording, practically
it is possible to use eight channels.32−34 Then, in simulations,
we have adopted an eight-channel TTTR confocal configuration, in which
eight single-photon detectors are required. For each fluorescence
photon, each channel will have 1/8 probability to receive the photon.
However, in the case of multiphoton emission in one pulse, we need
to consider wrapping of multiphotons in one detector. That is, in
the case of two or more photon emissions, there is a probability for
more than one photon to arrive in one channel but the channel can
only detect one photon because of a long dead time of the single-photon
detector.35,36 So, from the histogram of photon numbers
detected by detectors (Mn-det), deconvolution is needed to give a real histogram of the photon
number distribution (Mn) (see the SI for details).

2.2 Simulation Results
Simulations have
been carried out to verify the model. A periodic cubic box (side length
of 6000 nm), much larger than the confocal volume (wxy = 300 nm, wz = 1500 nm), was used to simulate the sample cell.29,30 The concentrations of oligomers in the sample cell were set in the
range of several nanomolars to ensure that there were only several
oligomers in the confocal volume at the same time. The laser excitation
wavelength λ was 646 nm, the laser excitation frequency f was 1 × 107 Hz, wxy was 300 nm, and wz was 1500
nm. The laser power varied from 0.1 to 20 μW. The numerical
aperture of the objective lens NA was 1.2, and the objective collection
efficiency η1 was 28.44% when the medium between
the sample and the objective was water. Optical components’
efficiency η2 and detector efficiency η3 were supposed to be 0.85 and 0.85, respectively. Properties
of all fluorophores tagged on monomers and dimers were assumed to
be identical. Molar absorption coefficient ε was 1.30 ×
105 L mol–1 cm–1 at
the excitation wavelength, and quantum yield was Q = 0.8. All of the simulations above were implemented in MATLAB with
home-written scripts (see the SI for simulation
details).

2.2.1 Monomer and Monomer–Dimer Systems
First, a solution of monomers (labeled with one dye) and a mixture
of monomers and dimers (labeled with one and two dyes, respectively)
were simulated. The excitation power, Plaser, was set at 15 μW. Diffusion coefficients of the monomer and
the dimer were D1 = 1.00 × 10–6 cm2 s–1 and D2 = 7.94 × 10–7 cm2 s–1, respectively.

Figure 2 shows the simulation results
for monomer-only (concentration c1 = 1
nM) and dimer-only (concentration c2 =
0.5 nM) solutions. Figure 2a shows the photon-emission probability P̅n as in eq 7. Since there is a probability for more than one molecule
to appear in the confocal volume at the same time, the probability
of observing three and four photons is nonzero for monomer and dimer
cases (Figure 2a).
Multimolecule contribution can be removed from P̅n to obtain the deconvoluted photon-emission
probability of only one monomer or one dimer, P̅n,deconv. For example, the probability
of two-photon emission by a single dimer P̅2,deconv in eq 11 was obtained by removing the contribution of two monomers . 11  It can be clearly seen from Figure 2b that the deconvoluted probability
of two-photon emission in one excitation is zero for a monomer and
nonzero for a dimer. Table 1 lists the concentrations and fluorescence brightness derived
from the model. For the two-sample system, all simulated c1 and c2 values are within
1% relative error from the input values.

and total photon number ∼ 1.25 × 108. For dimer-only
solution, input concentration c2 = 0.5
nM, simulation time t = 527 s, and total photon number
∼ 1.25 × 108. Laser power was set at 15 μW
(corresponding I0 of 0.1421).

2.2.2 Mixture of Monomers,
Dimers, Trimers, and
Tetramers
Two mixture solutions containing different concentrations
of monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers were simulated. The concentrations
are mentioned in the caption of Figure 3. Simulation parameters for the mixture of monomer,
dimers, trimers, and tetramers were D1 = 1.00 × 10–6 cm2 s–1, D2 = 7.94 × 10–7 cm2 s–1, D3 = 6.93 × 10–7 cm2 s–1, and D4 = 6.30 × 10–7 cm2 s–1, respectively, and laser power Plaser = 16 μW. Figure 3a shows the probability of n-photon emission P̅n. Figure 3b
shows the deconvoluted probability of a single oligomer P̅n,deconv, in which 12  Because of the
same total dye concentrations
and similar oligomer concentrations, there is almost no difference
in P̅n and P̅n,deconv for n = 0, 1, and 2 between the two systems. In addition, even
for n = 3 and 4, the difference in P̅n and P̅n,deconv is also small. However, we can still extract
the oligomer concentration from the simulation data (Table 2). All c1, c2, c3, and c4 values derived from the model
are within 6% relative error from the input values.

photon number ∼ 8.50 × 107. For the mixture
solution 2, input concentrations were c1 = 0.1 nM, c2 = 0.05 nM, c3 = 0.1 nM, and c4 = 0.05
nM with simulation time t = 510 s and total photon
number ∼ 8.50 × 107. Laser power was set at
16 μW (corresponding I0 of 0.1516).

2.2.3 Fluorescence Brightness
Effect on the Simulation
Results
Fluorescence brightness is directly related to the
signal-to-noise ratio of data and hence has a very important role
in the accuracy of concentration quantification. Simulations of mixture
solution of monomers and dimers with different excitation powers were
conducted, which are equivalent to simulations with different fluorescence
quantum yields. Figure 4 shows that with increasing excitation power, Plaser, the relative errors obviously decrease. At Plaser larger than 3.3 μW, corresponding I0 larger than 3.13 × 10–3, the relative concentration errors of monomers and dimers are within
2%. In practical experiments, fluorescence brightness of 3.13 ×
10–3, corresponding to a quantum yield of 0.9 in
our simulation conditions, can be easily achieved.

Figure 4 Relative error of obtained
monomer concentration c1 and dimer concentration c2 at different excitation powers. For the mixture,
input concentrations
were c1 = 0.5 nM and c2 = 0.25 nM, with simulation time t =
200 s for different Plaser values.

2.2.4 Noise
Effect on the Simulation Results
In real experiments, there
are at least two noise sources:14 one is
the background noise including stray
light, thermal noise, and scattering by the solvent; the other noise
is the dark counts of the single-photon detectors. To investigate
the noise effect on the accuracy of the model, background noise and
detector noise from 0 to 500 counts per second (cps) were added in
the simulation (see details in the Supporting Information). The relative error obtained from the model generally
increases with the noise level for both monomer–dimer and monomer-to-tetramer
mixtures (Figure 5).
For a monomer–dimer mixture, the accuracy is not significantly
affected even at a background noise level of 500 cps (Figure 5a) or at a detector noise of
500 cps (Figure 5b).
However, a monomer-to-tetramer mixture is more sensitive to noise.
The relative error is around 10–50% for the concentrations
(Figure 5c,d). To obtain
a relative error less than 20%, the background noise should be lower
than 200 cps and the detector noise should be lower than 100 cps (Figure 5d). In practical
conditions, a background noise of less than 200 cps can be achieved
and a detector noise can be low to 25 cps.

Figure 5 Relative error of obtained
concentrations and fluorescence brightness
for (a, b) monomer–dimer mixture and (c, d) monomer-to-tetramer
mixture solutions at different noise levels. In (a) and (c), detector
noise was fixed at 100 cps. In (b) and (d), background noise was fixed
at 200 cps. For the monomer–dimer mixture solutions, input
concentrations were c1 = 0.5 nM and c2 = 0.25 nM, and laser power was set at 15 μW
(corresponding I0 of 0.1421) with simulation
time t = 260 s. For the monomer-to-tetramer solutions,
input concentrations were c1 = 0.2 nM, c2 = 0.1 nM, c3 =
0.1 nM, and c4 = 0.05 nM, and laser power
was set at 15 μW (corresponding I0 of 0.1421) with simulation time t = 350 s.

3 Conclusions
On the basis of fluorescence antibunching property of individual
dye molecules, we have derived a new statistic model to quantify oligomer
concentrations in solution. In the model, an analytical relationship
between photon-emission probability under pulsed excitation and the
concentrations of oligomers has been derived. Simulation results have
showed that the model can accurately obtain concentrations of oligomers
with a relative error within
10% for mixtures of monomers and dimers, and monomers, dimers, trimers,
and tetramers at low-noise conditions.
