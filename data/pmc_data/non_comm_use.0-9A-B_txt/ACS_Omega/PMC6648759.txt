Photoactive transition-metal complexes
that incorporate heteroleptic
ligands present a first coordination shell, which is asymmetric. Although
it is generally expected that the metal–ligand bond lengths
respond differently to photoexcitation, resolving these fine structural
changes remains experimentally challenging, especially for flexible
multidentate ligands. In this work, ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy
is employed to capture directly the asymmetric elongations of chemically
inequivalent metal–ligand bonds in the photoexcited spin-switching
FeII complex [FeII(tpen)]2+ solvated
in acetonitrile, where tpen denotes N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,2-ethylenediamine.
The possibility to correlate precisely the nature of the donor/acceptor
coordinating atoms to specific photoinduced structural changes within
a binding motif will provide advanced diagnostics for optimizing numerous
photoactive chemical and biological building blocks.

Introduction
Building efficient
photoactive molecular complexes around transition-metal
(TM) ions generally necessitates employing cagelike or heteroleptic
ligands to promote the emergence of multifunctionality.1−3 Such compounds frequently present an asymmetric first coordination
sphere (1-CS) with chemically inequivalent metal–ligand (M–L)
bond lengths.4−7 The sensitive balance between electronic and geometric factors determines
the ground-state properties and the reactivity patterns of the TM
complexes. Geometric trends within series of closely related families
manifest through similarities in M–L bond lengths and bond
angles, which are revealed by systematic structural studies in solution
and in the crystalline phase.8−10 Such trends allow correlating
the chemical composition and the connectivity of the ligands with
the oxidation state and the coordination geometry of the metal ion.
Electronic trends associated to the chemical functionalities (e.g.,
presence of aliphatic or aromatic groups) and to the donor/acceptor
abilities of various ligands can be identified through nephelauxetic
effects or spectroelectrochemical series. Such trends enable a detailed
description of the synergetic covalency imparted by nonequivalent
M–L bonds, which can be further influenced by solvation.11−13 Once tested and validated, the comprehensive relationships between
electronic and geometric structures can be employed as design principles
to guide the synthetic strategies and to benchmark the descriptive–predictive
power of the theoretical methods.

Gaining similar insights for
photoexcited TM complexes is a crucial
step toward devising novel covalent assemblies with excited-state
manifolds that are tailored toward specific light-driven functionalities
and operando robustness. However, due to inherently short lifetimes,
the key metastable species are difficult to detect and their molecular
geometries often stand insufficiently characterized. In particular,
the response of the nonequivalent M–L bonds to photoexcitation
can rarely be inferred from indirect measurements so that it tends
to be postulated or calculated in most cases.

Owing to their
intrinsic spatial and temporal resolutions, the
ultrafast X-ray methods currently developed at synchrotron and X-ray
free electron laser facilities can deliver atomistic diagnostics about
energy-rich systems as they evolve rapidly after photoabsorption14−17 Specifically, transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TXAS) has
been successfully employed to quantify the alterations within the
1-CS of photoexcited spin-switching complexes in terms of average
M–L bond length changes.18−23 So far, very few studies have reported detecting unequal M–L
bond elongations with satisfactory accuracy from the analysis of the
near-edge region24,25 and the extended range26−28 of their TXAS spectra. The present work demonstrates how TXAS achieving
a high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio
can resolve the ultrafast changes of chemically inequivalent M–L
bonds in the photoexcited state of the prototypical spin-switching
complex [FeII(tpen)]2+ (where tpen denotes N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,2-ethylenediamine)
solvated in acetonitrile (CH3CN).29

Results and Discussion
The hexadentate tpen ligand is shown
in Figure 1a. The 1-CS
of the molecular complex [FeII(tpen)]2+ (Figure 1b) comprises two
inequivalent types of nitrogen (N)
atoms, namely, two aliphatic N1, N2 (cyan) in
the ethylendiamine linkage of the fused five-membered chelate rings
coordinated in a cis fashion and four aromatic N3, N4, N5, N6 (blue) in the six-membered
pyridine (cyclic imine) rings.

ligand. (b) Molecular complex
[FeII(tpen)]2+. The two aliphatic nitrogen atoms
are in cyan, whereas the four aromatic ones are in blue.

Depending on the crystallization conditions (e.g.,
solvents, counterions),
[FeII(tpen)]2+ exhibits different polymorphs.29−32 Nevertheless, for all reported structures, the asymmetric coordination
of the FeII ion induces a significant distortion in the
1-CS away from the octahedral (Oh) symmetry
toward the quasi-D3h symmetry
through a trigonal twist of the two planes (N1, N3, N5) and (N2, N4, N6), whereas the pyridine planes remain nearly perpendicular to each
other. The four Fe–Naromatic and the two Fe–Naliphatic are quasi-identical so that two inequivalent Fe–N
bond lengths have to be considered for describing accurately the ground-state
structure of [FeII(tpen)]2+.

At room temperature,
the complex in CH3CN is in the
ground state, where the FeII center is in the (t2g)6 low-spin (LS) configuration.29,33,34 Upon laser excitation at λexc = 400 nm, a fraction (f) of the molecules is promoted
to the singlet Franck–Condon state that decays on the sub-picosecond
time scale with a 100% yield into the metastable excited state where
the FeII center is in the (t2g)4(eg)2 high-spin (HS) configuration.33−37Figure 2a shows the μlaser_on(t) (blue
trace) and μlaser_off (black trace) normalized XAS
spectra at the Fe K edge (E0 = 7109 keV)
for a pump–probe delay of t = 150 ps. The
corresponding difference signal Δμ(τ) = [μlaser_on(t) – μlaser_off] is displayed in Figure 2b.

Figure S1 displays the k2-weighted EXAFS functions, χ(k), extracted from μlaser_off (black) of
[FeII(tpen)]2+ solvated in CH3CN
and from
μpowder of the [FeII(tpen)](PF6)2 salt (gray).18 It should
be noted that the traces are identical, ruling out any influence of
solvation.

The lineshape of Δμ(t) in the near-edge
region (inset Figure 2b) reflects the well-known spectral alterations due to the coupled
changes in electronic and geometric structures triggered by the double
population of the antibonding eg orbital in the HS state
of [FeN6] complexes.21,26 The inset Figure 2c zooms on the pre-edge
region. The splitting of the associated transition 1s → 3d,
which is dipole-forbidden in the Oh symmetry,
confirms the significant distortion of the 1-CS suggested by the crystal
structures.

Considering the pronounced anisotropy of the FeII ion,
it is clear that the analysis of the TXAS signal needs to go beyond
quantifying the elongation of a single average Fe–N bond length.
The established fitting methodology19 is
applied to extract the Fe–Nα and Fe–Nβ of aromatic and aliphatic character from a fitting
procedure where Fe–Nα and Fe–Nβ constrained as ρ*Fe–Nα are chosen as free structural parameters for 1-CS. Since differences
in distances between the metal ion and the nearest neighbors can manifest
as a structural disorder, a single Debye–Waller factor was
considered to allow distinguishing the contributions from two Fe–N
bond lengths in the TXAS signal. Figure 3 shows the labeling of the atoms used in
the analysis. Additional technical details are given in the Experimental Section.

from 2 to 10 Å–1. D indicates
the degeneracy of the scattering paths in FEFF. The values kept constant
during the optimization are indicated in italic. The corresponding
excited state fraction (f) is 34 ± 7%.

A value of 34 ± 7% is obtained
for f (Figure 4c) from a least-square
minimization procedure. Figure 4d shows the reconstructed k2*χ(k) for the excited HS state spectrum. The Fe–Naliphatic and Fe–Naromatic differ by about
0.04 ± 0.04 Å in the LS state. This slight mismatch has
been attributed to absence of π back-bonding from the saturated
Naliphatic to the FeII center. The TXAS analysis
that fits concurrently the LS and HS structures clearly captures two
different bond elongations in the photoinduced HS state: Fe–Naromatic increases by 0.17 ± 0.04 Å, whereas Fe–Naliphatic increases by 0.24 ± 0.04 Å. In the HS state,
the two bond lengths now differ by 0.11 ± 0.03 Å. The difference
ΔR = (Fe–Nβ) –
(Fe–Nα) and the ratio ρ = Fe–Nβ/Fe–Nα for the structural parameters
of the 1-CS are in excellent agreement with the results obtained from
DFT optimization summarized for the LS and HS in Table 2.

It should be noted that a detailed
comparison with crystallographic
data cannot be provided due to the polymorphism exhibited by the complex.
The increase in Fe–Naromatic (+0.17 Å) is shorter
than the ∼+0.20 Å observed for [FeII(bpy)3]2+12,13 and [FeII(phen)3]2+,10 which both display
1-CS with six Naromatic nearest neighbors. The increase
in Fe–Naliphatic (+0.24 Å) is comparable to
the one displayed by the HS synthetic analogues.38 This asymmetric bond elongation can be ascribed to an intricate
σ-donation and π-back-donation redistribution. Overall,
the net structural effect of the photoinduced LS–HS transition
is a large opening of the N5–Fe–N6 angle (where the two Naromatic atoms are located trans
to Naliphatic) from 109 to 132°, yielding an intraligand
groove that should promote preferential interaction with solvent molecules.
The detailed investigation of the solvation dynamics that accompanies
the photoinduced spin-state transition in [FeII(tpen)]2+ with combined picosecond and sub-picosecond transient X-ray
spectroscopy and scattering will be presented in future reports.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the present study on the spin-switching complex
[FeII(tpen)]2+ solvated in CH3CN
illustrates the distinct strength of TXAS to extract reliable structural
parameters for photoexcited complexes with multidentate ligand scaffolds
that display polymorphism or that cannot be easily crystallized. Moreover,
it can be expected that this structural technique will be generally
employed to deliver advanced diagnostic about the ultrafast evolution
of bond lengths in heteroleptic molecular complexes with definite
sensitivity toward chemical functionalities.

Experimental Section
Materials
[FeII(tpen)](PF6)2 was synthesized
according to the reported protocol.29 All
reagents were used as received from commercial
sources without further purification.

DFT Optimizations
The DFT optimizations for the LS
and HS states of [FeII(tpen)]2+ solvated in
CH3CN were performed with the Gaussian09 program package
[1] using the dispersion-corrected PBE-D3 functional [2] and the TZVP
basis set of triple-zeta-polarized quality [3] and without symmetry
constraints. Solvent effects were included with the polarizable continuum
model using the integral equation formalism variant (IEFPCM) [4].

Transient X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (TXAS)
The
transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TXAS) measurements were conducted
at beamline 11-ID-D of the Advanced Photon Source (APS, Argonne National
Laboratory). The configuration of the experimental optical pump X-ray
probe setup was similar to the one used adequately in previous studies.26,27 The laser pulses employed as the optical pump were generated by
doubling the output of a Ti:sapphire laser, yielding 400 nm laser
pulses with an ∼15 ps FWHM at a 3 kHz repetition rate. The
electron bunches stored in the APS ring delivered pulses with an 80
ps FWHM at 6.5 MHz repetition rate that were employed as an X-ray
probe. The molecular complex [FeII(tpen)](PF6)2 was dissolved in acetonitrile (CH3CN) to
a concentration of 1.8 mM, which is below the solubility limit to
avoid any clogging. The solution was continuously degassed by bubbling
inert nitrogen. This liquid sample was then circulated inside an air-tight
aluminum chamber through a stainless steel tube forming a free jet
of 550 μm diameter so that the sample in the probed illuminated
volume was fully replenished between two laser shots. In the region
of spatial overlap, the X-ray spot size was 50 μm (V) x 450 μm (H) and the laser spot was 850
μm in diameter. The time delay between the optical and X-ray
pulses (noted t) was controlled by a programmable
delay line (PDL-100A-20NS, Colby Instruments): the phase shift of
the mode-lock driver for the seed laser was varied relatively to that
of the RF signal derived from the storage ring with a 500 fs precision.
The incident X-ray energy was scanned over the Fe K edge (7709 eV)
up to 700 eV above the 1s ionization threshold. Downstream, a metallic
Fe foil was placed between two conventional ionization chambers. It
was utilized for calibrating the X-ray energy, for correcting possible
slow drifts, and for monitoring the X-ray flux in transmission mode.
As detectors, two avalanche photodiodes (APDs) were placed on both
sides at 90° angle from the pump–probe interaction region
to collect the secondary emitted X-ray fluorescence photons. A combination
of Soller slits with a (Z – 1) Mn filter was
inserted between the sample jet and the APD detectors, thereby reducing
strongly the background due to elastic X-ray scattering. A third APD
was employed to monitor the intensity of the incident X-ray beam.
For signal processing, the outputs of the two APDs were fed to two
fast analyzer cards (Agilent) that were triggered at 3 kHz by some
scattered laser light purposely directed onto an additional photodiode.
The X-ray fluorescence signals were then digitized by the card as
a function of time at 1 ns/point following each trigger pulse. The
fluorescence signals from the synchronized X-ray pulse at a delay t of 150 ps after the laser pulse pump excitation were accumulated
to construct the TXAS trace μlaser_on(t). The fluorescence signals from the same X-ray pulse averaged over
the 50 round trips in the storage ring that precede the pump event
were recorded to construct the corresponding TXAS trace μlaser_off for the complex in the ground state. The acquisition
software performed the shot-to-shot normalization of the X-ray pulse
intensities. Following such a data acquisition scheme, the μlaser_on(t) and μlaser_off spectra were taken under the exact same experimental conditions
for the sample, the laser, and the beamline status, which allowed
canceling out any error associated to drifts. Building the difference
signal Δμ = [μlaser_on(t) – μlaser_off] that stems from the fraction
f of molecules in the excited state delivers the transient XA spectrum
of the photoinduced HS state for [FeII(tpen)]2+. The integrity of the sample was checked over time by comparing
from scan to scan the lineshapes of the TXAS trace μlaser_off in the XANES region. No change induced by possible radiation damage
could be identified through the duration of the measurements.

TXAS Analysis
and Fitting Procedure
The Horae suite
was used for processing and analysis.39−45 The Athena program was first employed to preprocess the experimental
TXAS signal and to extract the normalized EXAFS function, χ(k), as a function of the photoelectron wave number, k, defined
by  where m is the mass of photoelectron, E0 is
the absorption edge energy, and E is the incident
X-ray energy.

Since the ground-state
(GS) spectrum, μlaser_off, and the excited (ES) spectrum,
μlaser_on, were measured simultaneously, the same
normalization and background removal procedures were followed when
extracting the experimental EXAFS function χGSexp(k).

The Artemis program based on FEFF6 in Horae was then employed to
fit χexp(k) to the theoretical expression
of the oscillation amplitude in the EXAFS region χtheo(k). This function was calculated according to  where i indicates
the ith shell of identical backscatters, Ni is the coordination number of the ith shell, S02 is the amplitude reduction factor
accounting
for relaxation of the absorbing atom, Fi(k) is the backscattering amplitude, Ri is the average distance between the center atom
and backscatters, σi is the mean
square variation in Ri, δi is the scattering phase shift due to the ith shell, and λi(k) is the effective mean free path.

The geometry of
the LS state obtained from the DFT optimization
was taken as a starting guess for the GS structure of [FeII(tpen)]2+ in CH3CN. The contributions from
all the paths in the first three scattering shells Fe–Nα,β, Fe–Cα,β,γ, and Fe–N–Cα,β,γ,δ were included in the fitting. The atoms involved in those paths
are labeled in Figure 3 of the main text. The shells share a common S02 and σi2. The parameters Fi, Ni, δi, and λi were calculated with FEFF6. The parameters Ri, σi2, and E0 were refined through
the standard least-square minimization of the k2-weighted EXAFS function, k2*χ(k), with k ranging from 2.3 to 11.0 Å–1. The Fourier transform of k2*χ(k), with k ranging from 2.0 to 10.0
Å–1, was fitted in R space
in the range of 1–3.2 Å. The error bars were returned
by Artemis.

For the ES, a set of excited EXAFS functions were
constructed based
on equation:  where E0, S02, Ni, and
σi2 are fixed to the
values obtained
for the GS.

To reduce the number of free parameters, the variations
in R were constrained by introducing the parameter
ρ,
defined as RFe–Nβ = ρ.RFe–Nα. The variable ρ was
varied from 0.5 to 1.

Since the experimental EXAFS function
for the ES state is extracted
as  the excited
state fraction f needs to be considered as an extra
fitting parameter. The geometry
of the HS state obtained from the DFT optimization was taken as a
starting guess for the ES structure. The fitting parameters and their
error bars were extracted from a least-square minimization procedure,
and the error bars were obtained from error propagation.23
