We present a nonlinear
transfer matrix method for studying the
second-harmonic generation (SHG) in nonperiodic metamaterial photonic
superlattices. A large enhancement of up to 5 orders of magnitude
in SHG efficiency was observed for superlattices made with a Cantor-like
quasiperiodic assembly of a nonlinear material and a metamaterial.
The enhancement was found to depend much more on the electric field
amplitude along the structure because of self-similarity effects than
on the amount of nonlinear material, which opens the way to design
superlattices for tailored applications in broad-band tunable lasers.

Introduction
Photonic superlattices have become the
main route for broad-band
second-harmonic generation (SHG) with high conversion efficiencies
(η) owing to their ability to control light transmission and
propagation properties upon designing suitable geometries. Dielectric
superlattices, in particular, can be designed to have reciprocal lattice
vectors, Gn, to compensate the phase mismatch
Δk = k2ω –
2kω, where kω and k2ω are the wavevectors
of the fundamental field (FF) and second-harmonic (SH) waves, respectively.
This enhances the second-harmonic (SH) conversion efficiency in a
mechanism known as the quasi-phase-matching condition.1−6 Other approaches to realize high-efficiency SHG employ the field
amplification in the structure because of the slow light effect (high
density of modes) at photonic band edges,7−9 or the strong
light confinement in photonic cavities, defective and disordered superlattices,
and plasmonic systems.10−27 The incorporation of artificial materials with a negative refractive
index  has led to striking phenomena in photonic
superlattices. The so-called metamaterials with simultaneous negative
dielectric permittivity (εB) and magnetic permeability
(μB)28−34 yield superlattices with a gap under oblique incident light, i.e.,
θ ≠ 0, known as the magnetic/electric bulklike plasmon-polariton
(PP) gap. The latter originates from the resonant coupling of the
magnetic/electric field component of light with the corresponding
plasmonlike μB(ω)/εB(ω)
effective response under transversal electric/magnetic (TE/TM) polarized
light, which cannot be observed in all-dielectric superlattices. The
bulklike PP gap edges and the PP defective mode were used for the
giant enhancement of SHG in the microwave and terahertz regimes,35 where the intrinsic losses of metallic building
blocks were shown to have a detrimental effect on the SHG in the high-frequency
regime.

In this work, we present an extended version of the
nonlinear transfer
matrix method (TMM),14 available for dielectric
and periodic bilayer systems, to consider nonperiodic metamaterial
systems under oblique incidence light. TMM is notably simpler, from
the analytical and computational points of view, than the Green’s
functions method used earlier for periodic metamaterial bilayer systems.7−9 Through the nonlinear TMM developed here, we use the bulklike PP
gap edges to numerically demonstrate that the enhancement factor of
SHG has a stronger dependence on the field enhancement in the structure
than on the amount of nonlinear material. For these purposes, calculations
are made using Cantor-like quasiperiodic metamaterial superlattices,
for which the amount of nonlinear material diminishes as (2/3)N for each successive N-step
of the Cantor series, whereas the unit cell length remains fixed.
This is in contrast with Thue–Morse- and Fibonacci-like superlattices,
where the unit cell thickness increases with the sequence step.36 Self-similarity properties of these nonlinear
structures can also be used to extend the results to be presented
for broad-band SHG applications,36−38 which cannot be reached,
for example, using defect modes.35

Theoretical
Framework
We are concerned here with the SHG from finite
quasiperiodic one-dimensional
metamaterial superlattices. The superlattices are made as a periodic
repetition of unit cells built by alternating a nonlinear dielectric
LiNbO3,4,154,15 labeled A,
and a linear negative-refractive metamaterial, labeled B, following
the Cantor fractal series, as depicted in the upper chart of Figure 1. Using a specific
rule to design the fractal unit cells, such as the Cantor series,
allows for control of self-similarity properties, thus providing flexibility
for tailoring and tuning the photonic properties. Hypothetical lossless
metamaterial slabs are considered, with their permittivity and permeability
given by 1   2  where νp = 10 GHz, F = 0.56, ν0 = 4 GHz, with ν = ω/2π.
By solving μB(νm) = 0, we found
the magnetic bulk PP frequency as νm = 6.03 GHz. nA(1) = 2.157 and nA(2) = 2.23712,14 are the refractive
indices for the dielectric nonlinear layers at their FF and SH waves,
respectively. At the microwave frequency regime, the assumption of
negligible losses is well supported by previous works.32−34 We use E0 = 107 V/m (intensity
∼13.3 MW/cm2) as the incident electric field amplitude.9 Superlattices are taken as grown along the z-axis. The propagation of a transversal electric (TE) incident
wave, i.e., the electric field E is perpendicular to
the plane of polarization (xz-plane) and the magnetic
field H = HTE,∥ + HTE,⊥ = |H|cos θx̂ + |H|sin θẑ is along that plane, can be described within the nondepleted
pump approximation as9,14 3   4  with χi(2), kiz(j) = ni(j)k0(j) cos(θi(j)), , k0z(j) = k0(j) cos(θ0(j)), and θi(j) denoting the corresponding
second-order nonlinear susceptibility, wavevectors, and propagation
angles for FF (j = 1) and SH (j =
2) waves in the ith layer, where χB(2) = 0 for linear
metamaterial slabs, and χA(2) = 6.7 pm/V for nonlinear LiNbO3 slabs at microwave frequencies.39,40 The transfer
matrix for the SH field in periodic dielectric superlattices in ref (14) can be extended to treat
nonperiodic structures including a metamaterial as  , where L ≥ 1 is the
total number of building layers in the unit cell, K ≥ 1 represents the total number of unit cells, and . Superindices
+/– indicate forward/backward
waves at each interface. Initial conditions for the SH field were
taken as E0(2)+ = 0 and Et(2)– = 0 because there is no incident SH wave. S = ΠLΠL–1ΠL–2...Π1, Zδ = ΠLΠL–1ΠL–2...ΠL–h, where (L – h > δ), ZL =
1,
Πi = GiQiGi–1, Mj = Aj(BjFj – ΠjBj), Jj = 2Cj[I – Πj]êx, with , , I being the 2 ×
2 identity matrix and 5   6   7   8  For simplicity,
we define 9  to write eq 5 as 10  where  

Figure 1 Transmission
spectra of a quasiperiodic metamaterial superlattice
with its unit cell made according to the (a) first, (b) second, and
(c) third steps of the Cantor series. (d)–(f) show the transmission
spectra of the SH wave generated in the systems in (a)–(c),
respectively. All of the systems were made with periodic repetition
of 10 unit cells. The angles of incidence were the same for the FF
and SH waves.

With the expressions
above, the forward/backward second-harmonic
amplitudes can be written in a very simplified way as 11   12  from where the total conversion efficiency
is calculated by η = ηf + ηb,7 with  and  being the efficiencies
for the forward
and backward SH waves,15 respectively.
The total length of the unit cell for each Cantor step (N) can be written as  (0 ≤ j < N), in contrast to other fractal structures,
like Thue–Morse
or Fibonacci, where the unit cell lengths increase with the sequence
step. The first (second) term in LN corresponds to the amount of nonlinear material (metamaterial)
in the unit cell. For simplicity, we use l = 27 mm
for all of the calculations in this work.

Results and Discussion
Transmittance spectra of the FF and SH waves associated with the
first three Cantor steps, N = 1, 2, and 3, are shown
in Figure 1a–f.
The corresponding unit cells are illustrated in the upper chart of Figure 1. All quasiperiodic
superlattices were taken as made by periodic repetition of 10 unit
cells. For θ ≠ 0, there is a gap broadening around νp = 6.03 GHz with increasing θ. This gap is known as
the PP gap,41 and is due to the coupling
of the longitudinal magnetic field component of light, HTE,⊥, with the magnetic plasmonlike effective response
of metamaterial layers. Figure 1a–c displays several sharp PP gaps for N > 1, because of self-similarity effects of the quasiperiodic
structure,
as predicted in ref (42). We tuned the angles of incidence as θ = 27.08° (for N = 1), θ = 46.45° (for N =
2), and θ = 24.69° (for N = 3) to have
both the FF and SH frequencies placed at gap edges to obtain the highest
values of the electric field amplitudes inside the system. FF (SH)
frequencies were selected as νFF = 5.8986 GHz (νSH = 11.7972 GHz), νFF = 5.9205 GHz (νSH = 11.841 GHz), and νFF = 6.0258 GHz (νSH = 12.0516 GHz), for N = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
The use of strong light–matter interaction in the bulk PP gap
combined with nonlinear properties of photonic superlattices to produce
giant enhancements of SHG efficiency has been already demonstrated.35 Here, we are interested in the analysis of two
competing effects: first, increasing N diminishes
the amount of LiNbO3 material in the unit cell as , which we may expect to be reflected in
a reduction of the nonlinear effects. Second, localized modes with
enhanced amplitudes are excited by increasing the self-similarity
properties of the unit cell, because of the amount of disorder introduced
by the fractal aspects, which must improve the second-order nonlinear
interaction in the right-hand side of eq 4. This electromagnetic field enhancement can be noted
from the electric field profiles in Figures 2a,b, 2c,d, and 2e,f for N = 1, 2, and 3, respectively,
for the FF and SH waves. To confirm that the maximum electric field
amplitudes for FF occur inside the LiNbO3 material slabs
or at their boundaries, in Figure 3 we replotted these results for the two unit cells
around the center (z = 135 mm) of the corresponding
superlattices. From Figure 3a (for N = 1), Figure 3c (for N = 2), and Figure 3e (for N = 3), we observe that the electric field profiles for the plasmonic
FFs follow the self-similarity properties of the Cantor-like superlattices,
as expected. In contrast, the corresponding dielectric SH field profiles
in Figure 3b,d,f do
not exhibit self-similarity because the dispersive effect in the structure
is stronger.3

Figure 2 Electric field profiles
for the FF and SH waves in quasiperiodic
metamaterial superlattices made by the periodic repetition of 10 unit
cells. The unit cells were built by following the Cantor series (a,
b) N = 1, (c, d) N = 2, and (e,
f) N = 3.

Figure 3 Electric field profiles along the two unit cells around the center
(z = 135 mm) of the structure. Results are presented
for FF and SH corresponding to (a, b) N = 1, (c,
d) N = 2, and (e, f) N = 3. The
values for the y-axes must be multiplied by the corresponding
scaling factors given inside the figures.

SH conversion efficiencies for these quasiperiodic systems
are
presented in Figure 4. Results for superlattices are compared with the ones corresponding
to a slab of LiNbO3 with the same total length, under the
same light incidence conditions. It is clear that increasing the field
intensity inside the system is more important than the amount of nonlinear
metamaterial in the structure, thus indicating a way to improve the
efficiency of this nonlinear process without requiring large amounts
of nonlinear material. Note also that for N = 1 the
enhancement of η is less than 1 order of magnitude compared
to a slab of LiNbO3 with the same total length. However,
enhancements of up to 5 orders of magnitude are observed for superlattices
made by following the Cantor steps N = 2 and 3.

Figure 4 SH conversion
efficiency, η, for quasiperiodic metamaterial
superlattices with unit cells built by alternating a nonlinear dielectric,
LiNbO3, and a linear negative-refractive  metamaterial, according to the
Cantor series N = 1, 2, and 3. Results for quasiperiodic
superlattices
are compared with the ones for an equivalent slab of LiNbO3 with the same total length and under the same light incidence conditions.

Conclusions
We have extended the
nonlinear TMM for dielectric periodic superlattices
to treat nonperiodic metamaterial superlattices, and demonstrated
large enhancement factors for SH conversion efficiency in the bulklike
PP gap edges of Cantor-like quasiperiodic superlattices. Significantly,
the electromagnetic field enhancement along the structure is much
more important than the amount of nonlinear material in the superlattice
to enhance conversion efficiency. This opens an avenue to develop
systems with small amounts of nonlinear material and high conversion
efficiencies; hence, our results may stimulate the design and development
of photonic platforms inspired by (and/or beyond) the one considered
here.
