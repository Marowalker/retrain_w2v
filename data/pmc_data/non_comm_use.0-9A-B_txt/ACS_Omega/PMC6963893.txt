Bone tissue engineering involves the combined use of
materials
with functional properties to regenerate bone. Nanohydroxyapatite
(nHA) can influence the behavior of cells. The functional and structural
properties of nHA can be controlled during nanoparticle synthesis.
This review defines the relationship between the attributes of nHA
nanoparticles and their biological effects, focusing on biocompatibility,
surface-area-to-volume ratio, bonding chemistry, and substrate functionality.
The paper explores how these aspects have been applied in the development
of scaffolds for the repair of damaged bone or regeneration of missing
bone.

1 Introduction
Advances in the field
of biomaterials and tissue engineering have
led to novel engineering strategies for improved regeneration of bone.1 Bone tissue engineering (BTE) has now taken on
an interdisciplinary perspective, in the search for new and better
ways to solve the biomedical engineering challenges of regenerating
bone.

Hydroxyapatite (HA) is the major mineral in natural bone
and constitutes
up to 65% of bone by weight. The solubility of these crystals is influenced
by their size and by variations in their chemical composition (e.g.,
the presence of carbonate ions in the crystal lattice). HA found in
normal bone differs from synthetic HA. The former has a more variable
composition in terms of minor elements such as magnesium and strontium
that may be incorporated into it. Synthetic HA has a high purity with
a known chemical composition (especially in terms of the Ca/P ratio)
and a high crystallinity.2 Synthetic HA
used in a block form as a graft can exfoliate after surgical replacement.
This limits its use in bone regeneration procedures. Also, the bulk
material is brittle and has low tensile strength and fracture toughness.3

The recent development of nanohydroxyapatite
(nHA) materials has
been driven by the desire to overcome issues with bulk HA or microparticle
HA and to improve bone integration and regeneration of bony defects.
Indeed, moving to nanotechnology approaches has become a major direction
in BTE. The application of nanotechnology concepts to the problems
of designing and fabricating bone scaffolds allows more precise control
of the regenerative features of scaffolds.4 This paper focuses on the properties of nHA and the applications
of this material in generating biocompatible, bone-like matrices with
functional properties that are ideal for BTE. The connections between
the production methods of nHA, the properties of the resulting material,
and the relavant clinical applications will be explored. A recurring
theme is that artificial matrices supported by nHA can generate the
desired nanointerface and enhance the regenerative function of scaffolds
by influencing cell behavior.

Key requirements of bone regenerative
substitutes are that bone
growth is stimulated (osteoinduction) and that a micronetwork of pores
and channels is present to allow cellular migration, transport of
nutrients, and gaseous exchange. The composition and geometry of a
scaffold should promote the development of new blood vessels and facilitate
the passage of the molecular signals that drive growth and repair.
From a purely mechanical aspect, the scaffold must support bone deposition
and tolerate applied forces during the time periods that repair or
regeneration are occurring.5

2 Clinical Demands for BTE
Bone-related
diseases and bone-related physiological conditions
account for a sizable proportion of medical costs. For most developed
countries, conditions such as osteoporosis and its associated sequelae
account for up to 15% of the cost of health care services. This level
of expenditure is expected to increase in the future as a result of
increasing numbers of cases of fractures in weight-bearing bones due
to obesity, osteoporosis, falls, and other accidents.6 Globally, hip fractures could reach 6.3 million per annum
by 2050, a 4-fold increase from the current rate.7 Research that focuses on cost-effective treatments for
these bone conditions is, therefore, of interest not only to clinicians
but also to biomedical scientists and engineers.

There are a
number of challenges associated with current “gold
standard” methods of treatment. For example, bone repair or
replacement requires immediate postoperative fixation to promote and
guide bone healing. The healing process can readily be compromised
by postsurgical infection or by reactions to the metal components
used for fixation. If bone autografts are used to treat large bone
defects, there is significant donor site morbidity. If allografts
or xenografts are used, these may transfer infection from the source
or elicit immunological reactions from the host.8

3 Biological Properities of Bone Associated with
the Design of Nanocomposite Scaffolds
Several fabrication
strategies that are used with bone nanocomposite
scaffolds have been inspired by the biological features of natural
bone. The resilience of natural bone is due to its unique microstructure.
Bone contains both HA for rigidity and collagen fibrils for reinforcing
and flexibility. As shown in Figure 1, the biological building blocks within the dense outer
parts of weight-bearing bones are arranged for maximum structural
support, with juxtaposed assemblies of distinct patterns, from folded
structures through to larger superstructural units.9 Similar concepts can be applied in composite materials,
including lamination and parallel fibrillary arrays, taking the key
biological features of natural bone and transforming them into an
engineering strategy for BTE. The optimal physical properties can
then be informed by finite element analysis and other computational
approaches.

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the internal structure of bone showing
its unique and intricate organization.

In bone, the unique combination of organic and
inorganic components
allows the bone to have stiffness but also to bend, rather then fracture,
under normal loading conditions. A parallel approach can be used in
BTE, employing materials to give the desired resistance to tensile
and compressive forces.

In addition to physical properties,
biological attributes also
need to be considered, such as how the material used will promote
the adhesion and differentiation of nonforming cells, and thus achieve
bone regeneration. Such aspects will be affected by features such
as surface area, surface energy, hydrophilicity, functional groups,
and conjugants. The nature of the surface and its interaction with
cells can be explored using gradient energy technologies assisted
by genome sequencing to optimize the materials used in BTE.10

4 Forms of Nanocomposite Materials Used in BTE
Compared to microparticles, nanoparticles have a greater surface
area to volume ratio and a stronger energy gradient profile at the
surface. The shape of nanoparticles and the behavior of the scaffold
can be optimized using three-dimensional modeling and simulation,
to align with the size and shape of the bone defect that is being
treated. Computational modeling can simulate the response to normal
loads and other stresses.

Structural engineering requirements
may dictate the need for particular
nanoscale design features such as nanorods, nanospheres, nanowires,
nanoclusters, nanofibers, and nanofilms as shown in Figure 2. To fabricate such nanostructures,
a range of methods can be used, including electrospinning, phase separation,
self-assembly, thin-film deposition, nanoimprinting, sol–gel,
and photolithography.11

Figure 2 Different structural
combinations of nanomaterials integrated to
construct a bone-regenerative nanocomposite material.

The large surface area of a nanoparticle, coupled
with optimized
wettability, can promote nutrient sequestration and protein adsorption.
When assembling a composite material, nHA has been incorporated as
a reinforcing filler, to enhance the mechanical stability of the composite
material, facilitate interactions with cells, and promote the proliferation,
adhesion, and differentiation of cells, including stem cells. It can
also facilitate cell–material surface interactions via selective
protein adsorption.12

5 Processing of Nanohydroxyapatite
HA
can be isolated from a range of natural sources, and nHA can
be synthesized using a range of chemical methods. Depending on the
method used, the final product will differ in terms of particle size,
chemical composition (such as the presence or absence of carbonated
groups), and crystallinity. This in turn will influence the behavior
of the nanoparticles when placed into a bony defect, where aspects
such as the rate of resorption become very important. Physical properties
of nHA can be controlled by influencing the particle size during synthesis13

6 nHA in Bone-Regenerative Scaffolds
For effective BTE, it is imperative the scaffold matrix supports
the growth of cells, from division through to maturation, without
causing deleterious changes to cell morphology or behavior. nHA may
be used alone or combined with other materials, to achieve the necessary
support infrastructure (physical and biological) for the desired bone
regenerative responses, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Combinatorial factors applied in bone-regenerative
nanocomposites
for targeted regenerative responses.

The materials used for BTE need to produce signals
that drive the
desired cell behavior. At present, there is limited data regarding
how the materials used in BTE influence the behavior of cells, for
example, how preosteoblasts interact with the nanocomposite interfaces
and how the genetic markers associated with their transition toward
an osteogenic lineage change over time because of this interaction.

Varying the nHA content and the physical properties of the scaffold
(such as its porosity) can alter the regenerative profile of the scaffold.
nHA acts at the site of initiation of nucleation. As nHA content rises,
more nucleation sites are activated, and the rate of apatite nucleation
accelerates. In this way, coating nHA onto scaffold matrices can enhance
their biomimetic properties and ultimately drive the outcome of greater
bone formation.14 If nHA is used in this
way, it is essential to achieve a uniform distribution of nHA particles
throughout the entire scaffold. Using an in situ precipitation
method can achieve this objective. Nanocomposites comprising nHA can
activate the activity of bone biomarkers. The extent of upregulation
in the activity of these biomarkers, which is driven by nHA, is summarized
in Table 1.

osteonectin (OCN); osteopontin (OPN).

A further aspect of scaffold design is the physical
form of the
scaffold. It must create a microenvinoment that facilitates the formation
and ingress of new blood vessels, to achieve optimal perfusion. To
achieve this, the scaffold matrix must promote the adhesion of cells
and integrate with the surrounding tissues. How these various aspects
work together is discussed further below.

6.1 Mechanically Stable Composites for Repair
of Load-Bearing Bone
Nanoparticles can readily be added as
building blocks to achieve mechanically stable bone scaffold matrices.
The influence of HA loading on the mechanical properties of some polymers
used in BTE is shown Figure 4.

curves; (b) impact strength, tensile strength and Young’s modulus;

HDPE/HA substitute used in current work, compared to human cortical
bone and polymer/HA composites for bone replacement applications reported

A range of synthetic materials have been shown
to successfully
integrate with nHA, with good mechanical performance for BTE. When
nHA is added to polymeric materials, the mechanical properties of
the final composite can be compared favorably to those of cortical
bone. As shown in Table 2, both the fabrication technique and the molecular weight of the
polymer influence the mechanical strength of the resulting nanocomposite
material.

Depending on the combination that is used, the mechanical
and chemical
properties of the synthetic polymers may be improved or degraded.
The chemical integration of nHA with polyester compounds can generate
porous scaffold networks that support the growth of cells and influence
their phenotype. nHA buffers the pH of the local environment as polyester
byproducts are formed during degradation. This reduces the extent
of associated inflammation during this degradation.15

Rather than using only one polymer, multiple polymers
can be employed.
One interesting approach is to fabricate a triblock scaffold. Two
polymers are initially polymerized and reconstituted with another
polymer of known mole fraction. This is followed by the addition of
nHA. The nHA layer adds desirable properties, such as improved cell
adhesion. It also increases the stiffness and the elastic modulus
of the scaffold and slows the rate of degration of the scaffold in
alkaline conditions.16

For regeneration
of bony defects with complex structures and intricate
shapes, successful integration is essential. BTE scaffold materials
must maintain the most appropriate structural geometry as the process
of regeneration proceeds. While chemical methods can be used to incorporate
nHA into scaffolds, these can at times be complex and technique sensitive.
An alternative approach is selective laser sintering, which is a rapid
prototyping technology. This method can be used to control both the
geometry of the final scaffold and its content of nHA or other osteoconductive
nanofillers.17

With greater emphasis
now being placed on nontoxic, biodegradable
byproducts, the use of clay-based hybrid materials, especially those
using clays from the smectite group (montmorillonites, saponites,
and hectorite), has attracted interest. Smectite mineral structures
have two tetrahedral silica sheets, overlaying an octahedral sheet
of cationic metals such as aluminum or magnesium. Small particles
are charged, and the surfaces of these particles are reactive. The
ability of clay minerals to delaminate facilitates a variety of interactions
(e.g., cation exchange, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding,
cation bridging, anion exchange, and proton transfers) between the
clay particles and organic molecules, on both the surface of the clay
particles as well as within their layers. These interactions are influenced
by environmental pH as well as by the size and electrostatic properties
of the interacting molecules. Interactions between clay minerals and
biological molecules can be used to encapsulate and retain the latter,
for later slow release, in order to stimulate growth and drive the
differentiation of progenitor cells. Using particles of clay minerals
also alters the mechanical properties of the scaffold matrix. Montmorillonite
has a high surface area and can be blended readily with natural polymers
and nHA. The strong interfacial interactions increase the mechanical
properties of the resulting nanocomposite material.18

6.2 Recapitulating the Features of the Extracellular
Matrix (ECM)
This approach employs, within the nanocomposite,
analogues of the molecular signals which regulate protein synthesis
and influence cell metabolism and tissue regeneration. The peptide
sequences are targeted to specific signaling events.

Integrin-binding
peptides, such as the arginylglycylaspartic (RGD) copolymer, can promote
osteointegration, as they stimulate the differentiation of mesenchymal
stem cells to osteoblasts. Amino acid esters and glucosyl, glyceryl,
lactide, and glycolide esters can also be used. These promote biocompatibility
and enhance the adhesion of cells and the secretion of bone. The RGD
copolymer has been integrated with nHA-grafted poly(l-lactide)
and used to reconstruct bone defects, as it promotes bone ingrowth
and bone fusion in defects of critical size. The combination of the
RGD copolymer with nHA provides a more stable scaffold.19.

6.3 Bioactive Polysaccharides
These polysaccharides
have properties that can promote regeneration. They dissolve readily
in either water or ethanol, to form a single polymeric phase. They
are biocompatible and contain functional groups that are suited for
cross-linking.

The first polysaccharide of interest is fucoidan.
When used at low concentations, this induces the differentiation of
stem cells to osteoblasts.20 Higher concentrations
are not suitable as they cause cell death. The regenerative property
of fucoidan is associated with its content of l-fucose and
with the sulfate ester group in its polysaccharide skeleton. For use
in BTE, a single-phase synthesis technique has been developed. This
achieves a homogeneous distribution of nHA in a 3D nanocomposite composed
of fucoidan and chitosan.21

A second
polysaccharide of interest is chondroitin sulfate (CS).
This is a glycosaminoglycan which forms part of the extracellular
matrix. Its negative charge bind proteins, to form proteoglycans.
It can also bind to and modulate the activity of growth factors, cytokines,
and chemokines. These features make CS useful for controlling signal
transduction pathways and hence desirable for use in BTE scaffold
fabrication. CS can be modified chemically and cross-linked with a
polymer to form a hydrogel for BTE. Covalent cross-linking gives additional
stability to the structure, to support the growth and proliferation
of cells.22

Further polysaccharides
of note are dextran and pullulan. Both
can be incorporated into hydrogels and linked to nHA. These polysaccharides
enhance water retention. Dextran and pullulan when cross-linked with
nHA have been shown to enhance tissue regeneration and mineralization.23

6.4 Injectable Hydrogels
Hydrogels are
an attractive means for enhancing bone regeneration without having
to undergo complex surgical procedures. A liquid or semiliquid gel
is injected into the defect. The hydrogel hardens slowly, as gelation
is triggered by a local increase in temperature.24

Thermosensitive hydrogels are classified in terms
of their critical solution temperature, which is the temperature at
which the polymer material undergoes separation from one phase to
another phase. At the lower critical solution temperature (LCST),
the polymer will become insoluble in aqueous solution with any increase
in temperature above this threshold.

Polymers that exhibit transitions
near body temperatures (35–37
°C) are useful for biomedical applications. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) with nHA has been used as a thermosensitive
gel in BTE applications. This polymer has a hydrophobic core and a
hydrophilic outer shell, and its LCST is 32 °C. Beyond this temperature,
the polymer undergoes phase transition into a compact precipitate.25 Other thermosensitive materials that have been
combined with nHA to prepare hydrogels for BTE applications include
the Pluronics, which are copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide).26

Aside from temperature, local pH can influence
the behavior of
the hydrogel. Thus, an important aspect of scaffold design is to determine
how the local pH will alter the physical properties of the hydrogel.
At the same time, the pH must also be optimal for the growth of cells.27

A hydrogel can direct the migration of
cells by releasing chemitactic
signals. In the same way, it can be designed to release signaling
molecules that promote bone growth or drugs for microbial control
during bone regeneration The physical properties of the hydrogel also
facilitate the proper integration and migration of cells. The addition
of nHA to a hydrogel alters its flow properties and its physical stability,
as well as stimulating cell proliferation and osteogenesis.28

The regenerative capabilities of injectable
hydrogels can be enriched
by encapsulating mesenchymal stem cells, which then differentiate
into bone forming cells. This increases the bone cell population and
is an appealing strategy for regeneration of deep, irregular bony
defects.29

6.5 nHA-Based Nanofiber Nanocomposites
Various therapeutic agents can be loaded onto nanofibers for controlled
release. By altering the diameter of the fiber, the surface area and
porosity can be controlled and thus the rate of drug delivery. Nanofibers
loaded with antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory agents could prevent
surgical site infection or foreign body reactions, respectively.

Polycaprolactone nanofibers loaded with antibiotic have shown promise
for regeneration of bone defects, such as alveolar bone defects caused
by periodontitis.30 Likewise, nHA can be
coated with a silicate into a core−shell.31 Coaxial electrospinning can integrate a core−shell
with a series of nanostructured fiber networks, to create scaffolds
for BTE.32

Examples of clinical scenarios
where these different kinds of matrices
could be used are summarized in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Synergistic application of different forms of nanocomposite
for
regeneration of clinical bone defects.

7 Computational Modeling of the Regenerative Properties
of nHA for BTE
At the macroscopic level, a scaffold must
retain the desired shape
or geometric configuration. At the microscopic level, the nanoparticles
and polymer matrix used in the scaffold must be chosen to trigger
the desired patterns of cell growth, fluid flow, and integration with
surrounding tissues.

From the known properties of the materials
used in scaffolds, finite
element analysis (FEA) can be used to assess the physical aspects
of the scaffold and its components. The modeling takes into account
the boundaries of the scaffold matrix, its porosity, and how particles
within the scaffold are dispersed.33

Another useful application of FEA is predicting the effect of changing
the properties of the nHA on the physical characteristics of the scaffold.
Changes in the apatite composition can be due to altering the variables
of the production process. Chemical synthesis, including Mg2+ or other ions in the reaction mixture, will result in their incorporation
into the apatite structure. Likewise, altering the temperature and
crystal aging time will alter the properties of the nHA as it forms.
As the level of crystallinity changes, so will the rate of resportion
of the apatite under physiologic conditions. Using such approaches,
nonstoichiometric forms of nHA can be created that are more biodegradable
and bioactive than stoichiometric HA. Such altered forms may be preferred
for certain clinical applications where faster resorption is desired,
as part of an overall scaffold design for bone regeneration.34 Key FEA variables that have been used in studies
of nHA-based composites are summarized in Table 3.

A further aspect of computational modeling in BTE
is the interactions
that occur between the surfaces of materials and proteins. Maximizing
this relationship at the submolecular level is important in developing
specific nanoscale designs for biomaterials. Molecular dynamics simulation
and steered molecular dynamic simulations can jointly be used to study
the interactions between material surfaces and bone proteins at the
atomic level, such as protein adsorption and desorption on nanotextured
surfaces. Several interaction parameters such as binding and desorption
energies can be calculated.35

Molecular
dynamics simulation can be used to study the interfacial
interactions and mechanical behavior of nHA with bone proteins such
as osteopontin, where electrostatic interactions occur between the
calcium of the nHA and the aspartate, glutamate, and phosphoserine
amino acids of osteopontin. During loading, the formation of new bonds
between the calcium and the amino acid residues restricts the movement
of the osteopontin peptides and generates a stick–slip motion
between the two surfaces. This motion explains the high fracture resistance
of natural bone.36

Molecular dynamic
simulations can explore the orientiation of proteins
that have been adsorbed on material surfaces. Changes in this orientiation
will alter the adsorption/desorption behavior of the protein. The
surface interactions can be influenced by intermolecular hydrogen
bonding as well as by the structural characteristics of the protein.37

Another perspective of how nHA interacts
with bone proteins is
based on changes in the conformation and orientation of the adsorbed
proteins, according to which the epitope of the protein has bound
onto the nHA surface. This parameter then influences cellular responses.
For example, the knuckle epitope of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2)
absorbs more readily onto nHA surfaces than does the wrist epitope
of BMP-2. The exposed wrist epitope interacts with the type I cell
membrane receptor on stem cells, and this triggers differentiation
of the stem cell to an osteoblast.38 There
are numerous other examples of how protein binding sites affect the
conformation and activity of proteins bound to surfaces.

Molecular
dynamic simulation is a useful tool for studying interfacial
interactions between polymers and ceramics. It can facilitate the
design of better composite materials by allowing laboratory optimization
of the elements of interfacial bonding, protein adsorption, and protein
recognition at the atomic level, during the development phase. High-throughput
screening methods can then be used to validate the regenerative outcomes
at the genomic and proteomic levels in the cell culture setting, to
verify that the desired pattern of cellular events is actually being
achieved, before then undertaking tests in physiological conditions.

8 Future Outlook and Conclusions
Bone
tissue engineering is a complex task, with numerous complexities
from the standpoint of design. nHA holds considerable promise for
use in therapeutic BTE interventions. Its properties can be optimized
during production to create advanced and cost-effective biomaterials
for clinical use. Changes in crystallinity and chemical composition
of nHA can be made to alter its rate of resorption. Nanofabrication
methods can give the correct shape of the nHA nanoparticles necessary
for achieving spatial control over cell behavior, while also imparting
the necssary structural properties. Advanced computational modeling
can help to optimize the interactions of nHA with bone proteins. Such
advanced qualitative and quantitative studies can be a critical element
of the design process for new materials and a prelude to cell culture
and animal model experiments. It is in the latter phase where the
regenerative performance of nHA nancomposite materials can be tested
under increasingly stringent conditions to verify that the design
intentions in terms of both bone formation and nHA resorption are
actually being achieved.
