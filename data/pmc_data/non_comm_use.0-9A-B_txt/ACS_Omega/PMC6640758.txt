The
uniform and seamless interface between graphene and semiconductors,
that is, without adsorbates or contamination in between, is of importance
for optimizing the electronic and catalytic performances of the combined
system. In this work, we try to synthesize graphene directly over
atomically flat TiO2 single-crystal surfaces using chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) with acetylene as the carbon source. The facile synthetic
conditions facilitate the formation of ultrathin polycrystalline graphene
films with nanosize domains, while reasonably maintaining the terrace-and-step
morphologies of the TiO2 surfaces. The established recipe
can thus lead to the construction of a contamination-free interface
between graphene and reducible oxides and also provide a well-defined
platform for further investigations into the physicochemical properties
of the graphene–oxide complex system from an atomic/molecular
level.

1 Introduction
TiO2-based photocatalysis has attracted immense interest
because it may serve as a feasible solution for global environmental
and energy issues.1,2 It is popularly acknowledged that
under light irradiation, semiconductors produce free electrons and
holes, which then diffuse to the surface and stimulate redox reactions.3 In this regard, the preferential recombination
of the electron–hole pairs is usually imputed as the main reason
for the low efficiency of the whole photocatalytic process. To inhibit
the recombination, a well-established way is to use additives or decorators
as charge trappers, for instance, transition metals in most cases.4,5 Recently, new carbonaceous materials, from zero-dimensional (0D)
to three-dimensional (3D), such as carbon cages, nanotubes, graphene,
and carbon black, have come into the family and gained more and more
attention because they present outstanding improvements in a number
of aspects.6−9 Graphene (Gr) in particular, a brand-new two-dimensional material,
has generated research interest owing to its superior properties such
as high thermostability, high transparency, high electric conductivity,
and easy manufacturability10−13 and has been found to be able to promote the photocatalytic
activity of TiO2 materials significantly.14 The promoting effect is usually attributed to the electron
reservoir role of graphene, which results in the separation of the
yielded charge carriers in TiO2 via the charge transfer
process across the interface between the two materials.15

There are two basic strategies among the
various preparations of
graphene–TiO2 composites reported so far. One is
physical mixing, that is, physical dispersion of one material into
the other.16 In this case, the interface
between graphene and TiO2 is poorly controlled. During
the preparation processes, adsorbates or contaminations on the TiO2 surface cannot be fully avoided. They stay as interlayers
and thus dramatically influence the desired electron transfer efficiency.
The second method is to grow TiO2 nanoparticles directly
on graphene or graphene oxide surfaces.17 This method may build direct contact between TiO2 and
graphene if the growth conditions are finely controlled but would
result in a rather small contact area. In other words, only a small
fraction of the TiO2 surface can be covered by graphene,
which naturally leads to a limited electron transfer effect. In this
respect, directly synthesizing graphene on molecularly clean TiO2 surfaces should be a promising strategy to achieve a uniform
and contamination-free graphene–TiO2 (Gr–TiO2) interface. The configuration is expected to optimize the
promoting effect of graphene over the TiO2-based photocatalytic
activities.18,19

Syntheses of various graphene
structures, either free-standing
or supported, involve a great deal of effort. The discovered recipes
include mechanical cleavage, chemical intercalation, and epitaxial
deposition.12,20−22 Particularly
with the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, high-quality and
large-sized graphene films have been routinely prepared on polycrystalline
transition metal surfaces and can be transferred to the substrate
of choice.23−25 However, the complexity and high cost of the transfer
process rendered the method unsatisfactory; these and the above-mentioned
contamination issues necessitated the appeals for attempts to fabricate
graphene directly over various dielectric substrates. For this goal,
using CVD, slightly lower-quality graphene films have been synthesized
directly on several unreducible dielectric insulator surfaces, such
as Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2,
and MgO.26−29 In these fabrications, methane and hydrogen are normally used and
a high pyrolysis temperature is applied. Such recipes, in principle,
can be transferred to reducible oxide surfaces, but the serious corrosion
effect under a highly reductive atmosphere has to be considered and
balanced with extreme care. An example was given by Sun et al., who
have recently grown micrometer-sized single-layer graphene using methane
and hydrogen on SrTiO3 (STO) single-crystal surfaces30 while keeping the STO surface fairly noncorroded.
Another option to suppress substrate corrosion is to use more-reactive
molecules
to replace methane as the carbon source, such as glucose, benzene,
cyclohexane, and acetylene, which, however, in turn reduces the quality
of the yielded graphene.29,31,32 By using acetylene and hydrogen as the gas source, Rümmeli
et al. synthesized nanographene directly over MgO nanocrystals.29 The facile synthetic conditions manifest the
possibility of growing graphene on reducible oxide substrates such
as TiO2.

In this work, we have prepared atomically
smooth rutile-TiO2 (r-TiO2) single crystals
by chemical etching and
subjected them to CVD growth of graphene with acetylene as the carbon
source. The advantage of using single-crystalline substrates lies
in their well-defined surface structures, which facilitate atomic-level
characterization of their surface processes. It also provides a model
system for a deeper understanding of graphene growth as well as the
catalytic reaction mechanisms over nanosized particles. As will be
shown below, while maintaining the step–terrace surface structures
of the TiO2 substrates, the ultrathin graphene films fabricated
were easily characterized by various techniques including atomic force
microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), electron microscopy
(EM), and Raman spectroscopy. The seamless interaction established
between graphene and TiO2 was carefully investigated with
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet–visible
light absorption spectroscopy (UV–vis). Unambiguous charge
transfer from graphene to TiO2 is demonstrated at the ground
state.

2 Experimental Methods
2.1 Preparation
of Atomically Smooth TiO2 Surfaces
Rutile-TiO2 (99.99% in purity) single
crystals (10 × 5 × 0.5 mm3) with (110), (100),
and (001) faces were purchased from Hefei Kejing Materials Technology
Co. Atomically smooth surfaces were routinely achieved by following
a recipe reported by Yamamoto et al.,33 which goes sequentially through ultrasonic cleaning with acetone
(Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) and ultrapure water (Millipore, 18.2 MΩ·cm),
etching with 20% HF (Alfa Aesar, 99%) for 10 min, rinsing with water,
drying in a nitrogen stream, and annealing at 800 °C for 3 h
in air. The atomic flatness and cleanness of the prepared surfaces
were confirmed by AFM and XPS measurements repeatedly.
All chemical reagents were directly used without further purification.

2.2 Synthesis of Graphene
CVD growth
of graphene films on the as-prepared TiO2 substrates was
performed in a horizontal quartz tube mounted inside a furnace (Kejing
Co.). The schematic illustration of the setup can be found in Scheme S1. Synthesis of the graphene film was
conducted as follows: (1) load the HF-etched TiO2 substrates
into the quartz tube and anneal at 800 °C for 3 h. This is the
same as the last step for preparing an atomically clean and flat TiO2 surface described above. (2) Introduce Ar and keep a flow
rate of 100 sccm after cooling the substrate to 100 °C and slowly
ramp up to about 650 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
(3) Introduce about 5 sccm of H2 and 0.5 sccm of C2H2 together as the reaction gas and maintian this
for a certain length of time (see text below for details), allowing
the growth of graphene overlayers with different thicknesses. (4)
Stop the reaction gas and anneal the sample in an Ar atmosphere at
the same temperature for a certain length of time. The thickness and
uniformity of the graphene samples can be controlled by varying the
concentration of gas mixtures, the temperature, and the growth time.

2.3 Characterizations
To verify that
the CVD product is graphene, examination of a number of characterizations
has been performed. AFM and STM images were recorded with a Veeco
Multi-mode V (Bruker) microscope. UV–vis absorption spectra
were collected on a SolidSpec-3700 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Raman
spectra were recorded on a LabRAM HR (HORIBA) microscope with a 514.5
nm laser. Optical microscopy (OM) observation was performed on a Leica
DM6000 microscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were
recorded on a SIRION200 (FEI) microscope. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images were obtained on a JEM-2100F (JEOL) microscope. XPS data
were collected using a laboratory-based Al Kα source (hν = 1486.7 eV) mounted in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber
with a base pressure of at least 1 × 10–7 Pa
(AXIS Ultra, Kratos Analytical).

3 Results
Preparation of a clean and atomically flat TiO2 substrate
is the first step in graphene synthesis. The r-TiO2(110)
crystals prepared by following the HF etching and air-annealing treatments
reported by Yamamoto et al.33 display a
clear step–terrace structure and are free of particles, as
confirmed by the AFM measurements shown in Figure 1a. The step height and terrace size are 0.4
and 200 nm, respectively, as shown by the line profile in Figure 1a, indicating the
atomic smoothness of the as-prepared TiO2 (hereafter indicated
as Pr-TiO2) surface. These prepared crystals are then loaded
into the CVD furnace for graphene synthesis using C2H2/H2/Ar as the loading gas (see the Experimental Methods section for detail). Figure 1b–d shows the AFM topographies
of the r-TiO2(110) surfaces after the CVD process for different
growth times. It is clearly observed that small added patches gradually
develop over the surface (Figure 1b) and emerge as a continuous film over an extended
growth time (Figure 1d); in the meantime, the step features are still maintained. Besides
the AFM measurements, the patch-like films that formed at the early
stage were confirmed also by STM and SEM measurements, as shown in Figure S1. The profile in Figure 1b, corresponding to the sample undergoing
30 min CVD growth, displays an increased surface roughness of up to
around 0.7 nm (peak-to-peak), much higher than that of the pristine
TiO2(110) surface (peak-to-peak roughness of around 0.1
nm). This surface roughening may be attributed to the corrugation
of the islands of deposits as well as the unavoidable slight etching
of the TiO2 surface. When growing over a longer time or
with higher C2H2 loadings, much thicker films
can be fabricated. It took 90 min to synthesize the film shown in Figure S2, but the gas loading was about 10 times
higher than that used for the film shown in Figure 1. It can be seen that the film has completely
concealed the underneath step structures of the TiO2 substrate
and developed into wrinkle-like features because of the large tension
at the interface.

surfaces as a function of the CVD growth time. (a) Pristine, (b) 30
min, (c) 60 min, and (d) 90 min. Line profiles I and II show the roughness
of the pristine and CVD-processed surfaces, respectively.

To determine the chemical nature of the CVD-synthesized
film on
the r-TiO2(110) substrates, we have conducted XPS measurements
over the as-prepared samples. Figure 2a shows the survey spectrum of a typical sample prepared
using CVD, over 60 min. Only Ti, O, and C signals can be found on
the sample surface, demonstrating the metal-free nature of the CVD
process, as well as the cleanness of the etching process while preparing
the substrate. Figure 2c shows the comparison of the C1s peak obtained for three different
samples, using air-introduced carbon contaminations as the reference.
Clearly, the carbon signals increase gradually with the extended CVD
growth time, accompanied by decreasing signals of both Ti and O (not
shown here), thereby dictating carbon as the main component of the
produced film. Figure 2b shows the high-resolution scan of the C1s XPS transition obtained
over the sample examined in Figure 2a. From the deconvolution, one can immediately identify
the strongest peak at 284.75 eV, corresponding to C=C double
bonding of carbon atoms within a conjugated honeycomb lattice, which
coincides with the synthesized graphene over various other substrates.34 Other peaks at higher binding energies such
as 286.4, 287.3, and 289.2 eV can be sequentially assigned as C–O,
C=O, and O=C–O species, respectively. In fact,
all these species and their distributions are perfectly in line with
those observed on the single-layer graphene prepared on the STO(001)
substrate.30 Therefore, we may safely propose
that the CVD-fabricated film is basically a graphene film but may
contain a significant number of defects or domain boundaries.

single crystals. (a) Full-range survey and (b) deconvoluted C1s core-level
spectra of TiO2 after CVD growth for 60 min. (c) Comparison
of C1s against the growth time.

The on-surface characterizations already dictate that the
CVD process
can successfully prepare graphene directly over the TiO2 surface. However, further confirmation and disclosure of the graphene
structure require more detailed characterizations, which necessitates
the separation of the film from the as-grown substrate. This can be
done by spin-coating a layer of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) over
the sample surface followed by HF etching (see Figure S3 for illustration of the transfer procedure). With
this method, the carbon film can be completely stripped from the TiO2 substrate together with the PMMA film and transferred using
a pincette onto the substrate of choice. After the transfer, the PMMA
can be simply removed by ultrasonic rinsing in acetone, which is a
well-established recipe. Figure 3a,b shows the OM and SEM images, respectively, of a
60 min film that has been transferred onto the SiO2/Si
surface. The latter has been ultrasonically cleaned in acetone before
use. The graphene film regions can be easily identified from their
darker contrast in both the images. Moreover, under the OM observation,
transfer-induced wrinkles can be clearly recognized, manifesting that
the as-grown graphene film is continuous and flexible. This is further
confirmed by the AFM measurements conducted on the same sample. As
shown in Figure 3c,
the transferred graphene film shows no obvious morphology defects
(such as holes and bumps). Furthermore, one can directly image the
graphene–SiO2 boundary and measure the film thickness,
as shown by the inserted height profile. In this way, the thickness
of the graphene film and the growth time can be correlated. For instance,
the apparent height of the graphene film grown over 30, 60, and 90
min was around 1.4, 2.0, and 2.5 nm, respectively, depicting a roughly
linear correlation as shown in Figure 3d. We notice fluctuation in the film height even within
the same carbon film. This may be caused by the inhomogeneous thickness
of the graphene film itself but may also be induced by the trapped
adsorbates that are dispersed unevenly underneath the graphene overlayer.

image obtained at the boundary of the transferred graphene film. The

thickness of the graphene film around 1.5 nm. (d) Diagram showing
the linear correlation of graphene thickness with growth time.

Raman spectroscopy is usually
regarded as the most reliable and
nondestructive technique to characterize the structure and quality
of carbon materials, in particular to investigate the ordering as
well as defects in graphene. Therefore, we subjected both the as-prepared
graphene–TiO2 samples and the transferred graphene
on SiO2/Si substrates to Raman spectra characterization.
As shown in Figure 4a, apparently, new features apart from those of the bare TiO2 can be recognized on the CVD-processed samples. Unfortunately,
the strong background of the r-TiO2(110) substrate (1000–1800
cm–1) overlaps with the characteristic features
of carbon materials, thus severely interfering with a detailed analysis
of the graphene structure (see full-range Raman spectrum of the bare
r-TiO2(110) single crystal in Figure S4). By contrast, on the SiO2 substrate, the carbon-related
Raman transitions are away from those for Si–Si and Si–O
bonds and therefore are very suitable for analyzing graphene-related
signals. As shown in Figure 4b, the graphene transferred onto the SiO2/Si substrates
exhibit four recognizable Raman peaks, that is, at about 1335, 1600,
2680, and 2950 cm–1. The two most remarkable peaks
at about 1335 and 1600 cm–1 can be safely assigned
to the corresponding D- and G-bands of graphene, respectively. It
has been extensively discussed in the literature that the G-band is
related to the E2g vibration mode of sp2 carbon
and its domain size and can be used to explain the degree of graphitization,
whereas the D-band is associated with structural defects and, in particular,
the disordering of the sp2 domains.35 Here in our samples, the G-bands display as sharp peaks
whereas the D-bands are broad but also fairly strong, dictating that
the film is dominated by graphitic structure yet with considerable
amorphous carbon coexistence. In addition, the position of G-band
is slightly blue-shifted relative to that of the perfect single-crystalline
graphene or graphite (1580 cm–1). This is another
fingerprint character of the formation of nanosized graphene.36 Actually, according to Rümmeli et al.,
the peak ratio of G-bands over D-bands can provide an estimation of
the grain size of the nanographene.29 By
following their method, we can estimate that the average grain size
of our polycrystalline graphene is about 7 nm (see Figure S5 for the deconvolution of the Raman spectrum as well
as the calculation of grain size of the nanographene). Apart from
the most intense D- and G-bands, the relatively weak and severely
entangled features at 2680 (2D) and 2950 cm–1 (D
+ G) also depict an imperfect graphene film.

r-TiO2(110) substrates and (b) the graphene films after
being transferred to a SiO2/Si substrate.

More direct and detailed evidence of the nanocrystalline
graphene
structure can be obtained through high-resolution TEM investigations.
To do this, the stripped graphene film has to be deposited onto special
sample holders for TEM measurement. A detailed description of how
to transfer the graphene onto the copper grids can be found in Figure S3. Figure 5a displays a low-magnification TEM view of the rather
clean and large-area graphene film that was synthesized using CVD
for 30 min. Focusing the electron beam over the edges of the graphene
sheet, one can directly determine the number of graphene layers. The
high-resolution TEM image shown in Figure 5b clearly reveals that the film is single-layer
graphene. In Figure 5c, a more careful imaging was taken to see the lattice fringes. The
interdistances were measured to be 0.25 nm, corresponding to the separations
between (112̅0) planes of the graphite crystal.37 In the meantime, the polycrystalline nature of the film
is immediately ascertained, with an average domain size of around
6–7 nm, a value consistent with the Raman estimations. The
typical selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is shown
in Figure 5d, which
clearly displays a diffraction ring decorated with isolated spots,
ascertaining the polycrystalline nature of the synthesized graphene
film.

The direct fabrication of graphene
on the r-TiO2(110)
surface manifests the feasibility of constructing a contamination-free
graphene–TiO2 interface. It also implies that there
may be little restriction between the substrate lattice and synthetic
graphene adlayer. In fact, various substrates from metals to insulators
have been successfully used as substrates for the growth of graphene,
and the achievable crystallinity of graphene turns out to have little
correlations with the graphene–substrate lattice match. We
therefore continue to testify the growing of graphene over other r-TiO2 surfaces, that is, (001) and (100) faces using the same CVD
method. Both of these latter surfaces are less stable than the (110)
surface and terminated with very different atomic arrangements. By
following a wet-etching process similar to that for the (110) surface,
these two substrates can also be cleaned and flattened to atomic smoothness.33 The as-prepared pristine surfaces are characterized
by AFM measurements, as shown in Figure 6a,e, respectively. Both surfaces are dominated
by multiple-layer steps as high as 1 nm, whereas the enclosed terraces
are nearly atomically flat.
After the CVD growth, both surfaces show changes similar to that of
the (110) substrate, that is, small islands developed accompanied
by slight surface roughening, as shown by the AFM images in Figure 6b,f, respectively.
Similar to the case of (110) substrate, these changes already indicate
that the graphene film has probably been formed. In Figure 6c, the Raman spectra collected
directly on the as-grown samples also show recognizable features that
are related with the carbonaceous species. After graphene was transferred
onto the SiO2/Si substrate, the prominent G- and D-bands
of the graphene structures can be unambiguously identified, as shown
in Figure 6d. In comparison
with that on the (110) substrate, the graphene films prepared on (100)
and (001) surfaces principally display the same Raman features but
with slightly weaker signals. Figure 6g,h correspondingly shows the TEM images of the films
synthesized over (100) and (001) substrates and transferred to Cu
grids, where the graphitic layers can be clearly identified at the
edges of the films. The TEM images also reveal that the quality of
the graphene structures formed on the (100) and (001) r-TiO2 surfaces of is slightly lower than that on the (110) surface by
using the same growth parameter. This difference, together with the
reduced growth speed, shows the dependence of the terminated atomic
structures of distinct surfaces, which may be attributed to the different
reactivities against the acetylene molecules.

4 Discussions
4.1 Optimization of the Growth Conditions
The above evidence
demonstrates that polycrystalline graphene with
an average domain size of around 7 nm can be directly synthesized
via cracking of acetylene over the three TiO2 single-crystal
surfaces, disregarding the mismatch of the lattice symmetry and atomic
arrangements. Researchers have recently discovered a variety of carbon
sources for graphene synthesis, ranging from pure inorganic molecules
to complex biomolecules.23,38 Most often, methane
is used mixed with hydrogen as the feed for CVD growth of graphene
on various transition metal surfaces. Frequently, high-quality graphene can be
fabricated under relatively high operating temperatures, particularly
taking special care over the control of hydrogen loading. The same
recipe can be applied to synthesize high-quality graphene on refractory
or unreducible oxides such as Al2O3,26 SiO2,28 and STO substrates30 as well. However,
when a reducible substrate, such as the TiO2 single crystal
studied here, was used, the corrosion of the substrate surface has
to be carefully considered. In our preliminary tests, the methane–H2 mixture with various compositions and flow rates were tried.
However, when the temperature was raised above 900 °C, which
is necessary for cracking of methane, the TiO2 surfaces
were always severely affected and step–terrace structures could
not be retained any more (see typical results as shown in Figure S6). This is not beneficial for the construction
of graphene–TiO2 interface and also contradicts
our purpose of maintaining well-defined TiO2 surfaces for
subsequent model studies. Therefore, we resorted to C2H2 with the consideration that it is frequently adopted for
the synthesis of carbon nanotubes and acetylene black films.39,40

The advantage of C2H2 is its higher
reactivity and relatively low cracking temperature when compared with
those of methane. In a recent study, Jain et al. reported that at
room temperature and near-ambient pressure, C2H2 can directly form graphene fragments upon adsorption on TiO2 P25 (a mixture of rutile and anatase).18 Although the authors did not provide further evidence for
real graphene evolution, the study offered a good starting point for
synthesizing graphene over TiO2 surface using C2H2 as the precursor. As found in our experiments, by using
C2H2 as the carbon source, the synthesizing
temperature can be significantly reduced from 1000 °C (typical
for methane) to around 650 °C. This brings unpreced- ented advantages
that the TiO2 surface can be protected very well from corrosion.
As shown by the AFM images in Figures 1a–d and 6b,f, the step–terrace
structures are all very well maintained on the three r-TiO2 single-crystal surfaces, when the graphene films are sufficiently
thin. On the other hand, however, the higher reactivity of C2H2 may also induce some disadvantages because it may cause
a fast growth of various types of carbon materials with relatively
poor control. It is well known that carbon nanotubes have been frequently
synthesized with C2H2 using a similar CVD process.
Although it did not show out in our preparations, this growth diversity
cannot be fully ignored. In this regard, the relatively low quality
of our as-prepared graphene may be understood because its growth can
be easily interfered by the various by-products under the reaction
conditions without delicate controls.

The controllable parameters
include the loading component and loading
speed as well as the growth temperatures. They may have significant
influence on the growth speed and quality of the graphene layers and
on the TiO2 surface structures. After a number of tests,
we finally fixed the best parameters as 0.5 sccm of C2H2 mixed with 5 sccm of H2, using 100 sccm of Ar
as the loading gas, and a growth temperature of around 650 °C.
Hydrogen is added to balance the decomposition of C2H2 to ensure better graphene quality; yet its partition is seriously
controlled in the range that will not induce significant surface reconstruction
of the TiO2 substrate. Finally, with these optimized parameters,
we can achieve a growth speed of roughly 0.03 ML/min with single-crystalline
domains of around 7 nm, which means that a nearly complete graphene
film can be normally achieved after 30 min of synthesis.

4.2 Growth Mechanism and Role of the Substrate
The growth
mechanism of graphene over semiconductor substrates
can be drastically distinct from that on metal surfaces. In the latter
case, there is a relatively strong interaction between the graphene
lattice and the metal surface and hence exerts a self-catalyzing and
epitaxial effect on the growth process. The formation of graphitic
carbon is usually based on the dynamic equilibrium between cracking
of the carbonaceous molecules, dissolving of carbon into the metal,
and its segregation on the surface.41 However,
on the semiconductors, particularly the oxides, much weaker interactions
are expected between graphene and the substrate, and the dissolving–segregation
mechanism would turn invalid. In this case, the oxide substrate itself
is usually considered to play a catalyzing role. On either SiO2 or Al2O3 surface, the surface oxygen
atoms are considered to be active sites, which may capture the cracked
molecular fragments and facilitate the growth of polycyclic aromatic
flakes.26 Liu et al. proposed that on SrTiO3 surface, both oxygen and metal ions are involved in anchoring
the graphene fragments.30 Nevertheless,
difficulties in characterization under the operational conditions
prevent a detailed understanding of how the cracked fragments of methane
bind to the oxide surface and develop into a two-dimensional graphene
structure. Here in our case, C2H2 as the more
active precursor in combination with more facile growth conditions
facilitate a much better understanding of graphene formation. Biedrzycki
et al. have recently conducted Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies to investigate
the interaction of acetylene with TiO2(110) surface at
room temperature.42 They evidenced a process
that includes heterolytic dissociative chemisorption of acetylene,
followed by a redox and cyclization reaction between the fragmented
acetylene on the TiO2 surface. Particularly, the unsaturated
Ti4+ (bridge O2–) ions on the rutile(110)
surface are proposed to be the suitable acidic (basic) sites for binding
the fragmental aromatic (hydrogen) species, respectively.43 The proposals fit well with our STM observations
conducted under ultrahigh vacuum conditions, where C2H2 molecules adsorb readily onto the (1 × 1) terminated
rutile-TiO2(110) surface and react to form larger clusters
at increased exposures
(not shown here). Further illustrations of the whole mechanism would
await more systematic STM works in combination with other spectroscopic
characterizations, which will be carried out in the near future.

4.3 Interaction between Graphene and TiO2 Substrate
Finally let us look at the interaction between
the fabricated graphene film and TiO2 substrate. The aim
of this work was to construct a clean graphene–TiO2 interface and provide a model system for further investigations
of the photocatalytic mechanism of the complex system. Therefore,
the TiO2 single crystals were adopted as the substrates.
HF-etching followed by annealing in an inert Ar atmosphere at high
temperatures ensures surface flatness and cleanness, as verified by
AFM and XPS characterizations. Also, during the graphene synthesis,
the surface was protected from any contaminations other than the carbonaceous
species yielded from C2H2. The growth temperature
applied was mild but high enough to keep the surface clean from added
water species. On the other hand, it should also be proper to activate
the C2H2 molecules on the TiO2 surfaces
while preventing them from thermally cracking in the gas phase. Moreover,
the small hydrogen loading was adopted for improving the quality of
the synthesized graphene, but carefully controlled to prevent severe
etching of the substrate as well as formation of large amount of surface
hydroxyls. With all these considerations, a clean graphene–TiO2 interface can be safely concluded.

Once the seamless
graphene–TiO2 connection is built up, careful XPS
characterizations would help us to look into the interactions between
the two components in the complex. Figure 7a,b shows the detailed XPS spectra analyses
of the Ti2p and O1s core-level signals measured on different samples,
respectively. It should be noted here that the carbon peak was fixed
at 284.8 eV, serving as the reference for all XPS transitions (see
the C1s XPS spectra in Figure 3c). One can immediately recognize a positive shift of the
core-level binding energy of both Ti2p and O1s on the TiO2 samples after CVD growth of the graphene layer. For the growth time
of 30 min, the chemical shift is around 0.6 eV, whereas it reaches
a maximum of 0.8 eV for 60 min and is constant for thicker films.
In a controlled experiment, the graphene film was stripped and the
substrate (hence termed as St-TiO2) was subject to XPS
measurement again. Interestingly, both Ti2p and O1s were found to
restore to the original values corresponding to the pristine TiO2. It is worth pointing out that the transfer process has an
ignorable effect on the TiO2 surface, as long as the operation
is carefully controlled within a few minutes (see Figure S7). Therefore, the upward shifts of the core levels
is a direct measure of the charge transfer from graphene to TiO2, which has originated from the work function difference between
the two materials.44 The transferred charges
build up surface dipoles and lead to a prominent downward band-bending
and a sufficient increase in the binding energies of both Ti2p and
O1s of the TiO2 substrate.

time. (c) Deconvoluted high-resolution Ti2p spectrum obtained on a
sample grown for 90 min (Gt = 90 min). (d) Deconvoluted high-resolution
O1s spectrum of the same sample in (c).

More detailed analyses of the Ti2p and O1s spectra are shown
in Figure 7c,d, respectively.
As can be found in Figure 7c, there is a small fraction of the total signal peaked at
around 457.8 eV, corresponding to the Ti3+ ions that have
been produced upon the reduction of TiO2 substrate. However,
a majority of the Ti ions are still in +4 state. Furthermore, if we
look back at the deconvoluted C1s spectrum shown in Figure 2b, we can notice that there
is no indication for any C–Ti species, manifesting the lack
of carbon doping as well as surface C–Ti bonds. For the O1s
spectrum, additional features are observed besides the TiO2-related major peak at 530.6 eV. Two shouldering peaks at 531.2 and
532.6 eV can be assigned to the surface hydroxyls and carboxyls, respectively.45 These species are either intrinsic on the defects
of the graphene layers or introduced during the exposure to air. Their
existence is consistent with the polycrystalline phase of the graphene
film synthesized. Many studies consider that these oxygen species
improve the interaction between the graphene film and TiO2 surface, sometimes leading to a strengthened charge transfer effect.46

The interactions between graphene and
TiO2 can also
be characterized by the changes in the light-absorption properties.
Band-gap narrowing and enhanced absorption of visible light have been
frequently reported for the variously prepared graphene–TiO2 complex systems.47,48 Here, we also carried
out UV–vis spectroscopy measurements on our contamination-free
graphene–TiO2 combined samples. As shown in Figure 8a, along with increase
in the growth time, that is, the thickness of the synthesized graphene
layers, the TiO2 crystal has displayed an increasingly
enhanced adsorption of the visible light ranging from 400 to 800 nm.
This is simply embodied by the deepened color of the TiO2 samples along with the growth time. Based on the Kubelka–Munk
method,49 optical band gaps can be derived
from the measured absorption data as shown in Figure 8b. The pristine TiO2 single crystal
displays a band gap around 2.91 eV, which roughly coincides with the
reported value of 3.0 eV. After growing graphene for 60 min, the band
gap is slightly reduced to 2.87 eV. This small reduction, although
very close to the error limit of this estimation method, reproduced
very well on different batches of samples and can be confirmed clearly
from the raw UV–vis data as shown in Figure 8a. We notice that the band gap narrowing
also contains the contribution of TiO2 reduction. Therefore,
we tried to strip the graphene film away and measured the UV–vis
adsorption again. As shown by the blue dashed line in Figure 8b, after removing the graphene
layers, the band gap narrowing is slightly suppressed when compared
to that with graphene overlaid.
This result dictates that there is a rather weak effect of graphene
in modifying the band gap of TiO2, which is in line with
the weak interactions between graphene and TiO2. The observed
weak effect is in drastic contrast to the results of previous studies
of mixed graphene oxide and TiO2 particles, where prominent
band gap reduction was observed.14,44,46 The possible reason may be the extremely low mass
ratio of graphene over TiO2 in our case. It may also be
due to the relatively low quality of our synthesized graphene layers.

5 Conclusions
In conclusion, by using acetylene mixed with hydrogen as the feeding
gas for a simple CVD process, we have successfully synthesized graphene
films directly on atomically flat rutile-TiO2 single crystals.
With various characterizations including AFM, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy,
the polycrystalline nature of the graphene films with average domain
size of around 7 nm is clearly revealed. Most importantly, the mild
growth conditions do not influence the step–terrace structure
observed on the pristine TiO2 single crystals that have
been successfully used in this work as CVD substrates. Even though
the mechanism of graphene formation is yet unclear at the present
stage, the reactive adsorption of acetylene on the TiO2 surface followed by intermolecular heterocyclic reactions has been
proposed as the possible growth route of graphene. Detailed XPS and
UV–vis measurements confirmed the seamless connection between
the synthesized graphene layers with the TiO2 substrates,
but also clearly manifest the charge transfer from graphene to TiO2 materials in the absence of interface adsorbates. Not only
do the results of the study demonstrate that direct fabrication of
the graphene–reducible oxide is feasible, but the obtained
samples also provide a suitable model system for further investigations
of photocatalytic chemistry mechanism of this complex system.
