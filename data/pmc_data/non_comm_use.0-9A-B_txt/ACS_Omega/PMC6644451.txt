The
use of anion-exchange resins to separate and purify plutonium
from various sources represents a major bottleneck in the throughput
that can be achieved when this step is part of a larger separation
scheme. Slow sorption kinetics and broad elution profiles necessitate
long contact times with the resin, and the recovered Pu is relatively
dilute, requiring the handling of large volumes of hazardous material.
In this work, high internal-phase emulsion (HIPE) foams were prepared
with a comonomer containing a dormant nitroxide. Using surface-initiated
nitroxide-mediated polymerization, the foam surface was decorated
with a brush of poly(4-vinylpyridine), and the resulting materials
were tested under controlled flow conditions as anion-exchange media
for plutonium separations. It was found that the grafted foams demonstrated
greater ion-exchange capacity per unit volume than a commercial resin
commonly used for Pu separations and had narrower elution profiles.
The ion-exchange sites (quaternized pyridine) were exposed on the
surface of the large pores of the foam, resulting in convective mass
transfer, the driving force for the excellent separation properties
exhibited by the synthesized polyHIPE foams.

Introduction
Past decades have seen
pointed inquiry into improving the processes
for recovering and purifying valuable fissile material from spent
nuclear fuel (reprocessing), legacy materials, mixed waste streams,
etc.1−11 Despite these efforts, seasoned technologies such as organophosphorus-based
solvent extraction (e.g., the PUREX process) and ion-exchange (IX)
resins persist as the dominant techniques for separation and purification
of fissile materials used independently or as part of a larger separation
scheme. For plutonium, an anion-exchange resin purification conducted
in nitric acid is the preferred technique for recovery from a variety
of sources. Pu(IV) strongly adsorbs onto anion-exchange sites (quaternized
pyridine) as the 12-coordinate hexanitrato complex in concentrated
nitric acid (7–9 M).1 Once the resin
is loaded, it is generally washed with concentrated nitric acid to
remove weakly bound or unbound impurities; then, the Pu(IV) is eluted
from the column in dilute (0.35 M) nitric acid. The Pu(IV) recovered
from this process is generally obtained in a highly pure form.2 A popular resin used for this process is Reillex
HPQ, a resin of partially methylated poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP)
cross-linked with divinylbenzene (25 wt %), which exhibits excellent
stability in the harsh radiation and concentrated nitric acid conditions,
hence its dominance as a Pu separation tool for the past three decades.4

Though Reillex HPQ is an excellent ion-exchange
material from a
capacity and stability point-of-view, it is not without disadvantages.
The chief mechanism of mass transport in resin chromatography is diffusion
into the small pores on a resin bead’s surface. This slow process
has important implications for separation efficiency, including slow
sorption kinetics and broad profiles during elution, leading to relatively
dilute solutions of recovered Pu that must be handled. Processing
actinides is a risky and expensive endeavor because of the radioactivity
and toxicity characteristic of each actinide element; efforts to minimize
the amount of hazardous material that must be handled are an important
element of actinide separation process intensification.12

The resin-based separation of Pu used
as part of the HB-line process
(a facility originally dedicated to the production of Pu-238 and now
used for the recovery of valuable legacy fissile materials) at the
Savannah River Site in Aiken, SC offers an opportunity to not only
develop a material that has the strengths of an anion-exchange resin
but also improve the mass transfer properties that may lead to more
efficient separations. A scaffold that offers the potential to meet
both needs lies in polymerized high internal-phase emulsion (polyHIPE)
foams. PolyHIPEs are generally formed from water-in-oil emulsions
in which the oil phase contains radically polymerizable monomer and
cross-linker that are cured by a thermal radical initiator.13 Recent years have seen robust development of
these porous polymers as solid supports for various separations and
chemical transformations.14−26 Specifically, polyHIPEs with surface-grafted chains of P4VP prepared
via photoinitiated polymerization have been studied as a potential
replacement for columns of Reillex HPQ for the Pu purification process
at the Savannah River Site.27,28 Conveniently, the backbone
of the polyHIPE foam is polystyrene cross-linked with divinylbenzene
(a similar chemical composition to the Reillex resin), which is known
to have fairly good stability under the harsh acid and radiation conditions
used for testing.4 In batch testing experiments,
the foam samples were found to have faster uptake kinetics than the
resin.27 Testing of similarly prepared
P4VP-grafted monoliths under controlled flow conditions showed that
the Pu could be eluted from the columns much more efficiently than
the resin and despite having a lower anion-exchange capacity (based
on nitrogen content due to P4VP), some of the tested foams could adsorb
more Pu per unit mass than the resin.28 These performance improvements are likely owed to the convective
mass transport made possible by the large open pore structure afforded
by the polyHIPEs. Grafting the chains from the foam surface ensures
all ion-exchange functionality is freely available on the surface
of the foam, rather than hidden in the bulk of the material (like
a resin bead). However, preparation of surface-grafted foams using
a surface-photoinitiation approach limited the size of columns that
could be produced and the amount of grafted P4VP was somewhat unpredictable.28 To be a viable replacement for anion-exchange
resins, the ion-exchange capacity of the foam materials needed improvement.

Reported herein is a new approach to the synthesis of P4VP-grafted
polyHIPE foams prepared using a dormant nitroxide, which is incorporated
into the foam backbone as a comonomer. The use of this functional
comonomer allows for excellent control over the amount of nitroxide-mediated
polymerization (NMP) sites available for surface-grafting chains of
P4VP. Using this new approach to P4VP-grafted polyHIPE foams, monolithic
columns were prepared with a much higher degree of P4VP functionalization
than with the photoinitiated approach, also allowing for monoliths
of any size to be prepared since the mode of initiation of the surface
polymerization is thermal rather than light activated. Surface-grafted
polyHIPE foam monoliths prepared in this manner were also tested for
their Pu separation capabilities and were found to have excellent
capacity and elution characteristics compared with the Reillex HPQ
resin.

Results and Discussion
A main aim of this work was
to increase the anion-exchange capacity
of P4VP-grafted polyHIPE monoliths. Previous work with these materials
showed their promising chromatographic separation behavior owed to
an interconnected pore structure and the method of incorporating anion-exchange
functionality directly on the surface of the foam where they can be
freely accessed in solution through convective mass transport.27,28 PolyHIPE foams have previously been shown to have very robust mechanical
properties (yield strengths of up to 130 psi).27,29 PolyHIPE foams representative of those tested in this report (pre-
and post-P4VP grafting) were tested for their mechanical properties
under a series of compressive forces (60–100 psi) (Figure S1). It was found that at each pressure
tested, the foams exhibited elastic recovery, even after applying
the compressive force for 12 h. This is evidence that under these
pressures, the polyHIPE foams do not mechanically degrade. Despite
these desirable properties, the foams prepared by photoinitiated graft
polymerization could not be prepared with comparable ion-exchange
capacity to the Reillex HPQ resin on a volumetric basis, an important
parameter if these materials should become suitable to directly replace
a resin column in a separation scheme, for example.28 To overcome this limitation, a new approach to synthesizing
polyHIPE foams with many surface-bound initiating sites was developed
(Scheme 1). This method
borrows a concept from early work done with star and hyperbranched
polymers by Hawker and co-workers;30−32 the vinyl moiety on
the nitroxide containing monomer can be radically polymerized at a
lower temperature than that which homolytically activates the carbon–oxygen
bond of the alkoxyamine. This allows for the incorporation of the
functional comonomer (1) at high weight fractions in the initial high
internal-phase emulsion, and the comonomer content can be tuned more
or less independently from the pore structure of the polyHIPE. Some
of the dormant nitroxide groups then presumably end up on the surface
of the cured foam and are available as surface-initiating sites to
grow P4VP.

Table 1 summarizes
the measured characteristics of the polyHIPE foams prepared for testing.
The cross-linker content of the polyHIPE foam was kept constant throughout
all samples to emulate the backbone structure of the resin (and ideally
a similar chemical stability in harsh conditions). The nitrogen content
of the polyHIPEs was analyzed before and after the surface polymerization.
The nitrogen in the cured polyHIPEs is due to the dormant nitroxide,
and the nitrogen present in the samples after the surface-initiated
polymerization of P4VP represents the nitrogen due to the combination
of nitroxide groups and polymer present. Because the surface-bound
initiating species is a benzyl radical, directly characterizing the
grafted P4VP is difficult because there is no straightforward way
to cleave the grafted polymer.

A solution analog
of the initiating species was synthesized, and
the kinetics of the polymerization were studied according to Scheme 2. The results of
the kinetic study are shown in Figure 1. An approximately linear relationship between ln([M0]/[Mt]) and time indicates a pseudo first-order
relationship between monomer consumption and reaction time (Figure 1a). The evolution
of molecular weight with respect to monomer conversion (Figure 1b) is fairly linear up to ∼30%
conversion, with dispersity (Đ) values ranging
from 1.3 to 1.55. It is important to note that there are many examples
in the literature that demonstrate that rates of polymerization may
differ greatly between solution polymerizations and surface-initiated
polymerizations.33−36 This study was not intended to be used as a direct estimation of
the kinetics of the surface-initiated polymerization but rather to
serve as a model for how well-controlled the surface-initiated polymerization
may be. On the basis of the behavior of the polymerization of P4VP
in solution initiated by compound (2), we hypothesize that the polymerization
behavior of P4VP grown from the foam-bound NMP initiating species
(which is chemically very similar to the benzyl radical generated
in the solution study) is qualitatively similar to the solution study
in terms of the initiation and nitroxide-mediated control on the growing
polymer.

Using

After each surface-initiated
polymerization of P4VP on the polyHIPEs,
there was an appreciable increase in mass for all samples, indicating
that a large amount of ion-exchange functionality was grafted from
the foam surface. Figure 2a,b shows the foam morphology after curing, and Figure 2 c,d shows this after
the surface polymerization. From images in Figure 2a,c there is no perceptible difference in
the overall morphology of the pore structure before and after the
graft polymerization. There is a marked difference in the surface
of the foam before and after the surface polymerization, which is
observed at high magnification (Figure 2b,d). The evolution of a distinctly rougher texture
is a visual indication of the grafted polymer brush that extends from
the foam surface.

Column prototypes made from the synthesized polyHIPE monoliths
were tested under controlled flow conditions for their Pu adsorption
capacity and elution characteristics according to Scheme S1. In these tests, our aim was to demonstrate that
this material efficiently binds and elutes Pu under these test conditions
so pure Pu solution was used to demonstrate these properties. In the
separation scheme used at the HB-line facility, the only ion that
efficiently binds with the resin at this particular step of the scheme
is the [Pu(NO3)6]2– so these
polyHIPE materials, in principle, should exhibit similar selectivity
toward the Pu ions at this step of the separation scheme since the
anion-exchange group is the same. Figure 3 shows the Pu loading curves of each tested
material as a function of bed volumes of the ion-exchange material.
The resin and foam materials are compared on a volumetric basis (bed
volumes) because of the large difference in the density between them.
Column bed volumes (defined as the volume of solution required to
fully saturate the monolith or resin bed) are normalized values to
account for small differences in void volumes between samples. Measured
concentrations of Pu are expressed as [Pu eluate]/[Pu feed], where
when the ratio is less than 1, the concentration of the collected
eluate was less than that of the feed solution, and when the ratio
was greater than 1, concentration of the collected eluate was greater
than that of the feed solution. It was found that the majority of
the polyHIPE samples tested equaled or exceeded the capacity of the
Reillex HPQ resin as a function of the number of bed volumes until
significant (∼10%) breakthrough of the feed solution occurred.
This confirms that the procedure developed in this work to incorporate
many NMP initiating sites into the foam backbone, which are activated
thermally, is an effective strategy for imparting a large amount of
ion-exchange functionality onto the foam surface. Interestingly, there
is an approximately linear correlation between the capacity of each
of the polyHIPE samples with respect to the amount of nitrogen due
to P4VP in the sample (Figure S2). This
indicates that there is no discernible effect on the Pu capacity from
the graft density (chains per unit area) or the molecular weight of
the grafted chains.

polyHIPE
materials. (Labels (A)–(F) refer to the polyHIPE foam samples
described in Table 1.)

The corresponding elution curves
for the above-mentioned samples
are presented in Figure 4. The key benefit of the convective mass transfer resulting from
the foam’s large interconnected pore structure is realized
here. For each of the foam samples, the loaded Pu is fully eluted
from the column over the course of approximately two bed volumes,
sometimes fewer. In comparison, quantitative elution of the Pu from
the Reillex HPQ column occurs over about four bed volumes, meaning
that the collected Pu eluate is much less concentrated than the eluate
generated from the foam materials. This broadened elution profile
is a direct result of the diffusive mass transfer occurring in the
pores of the resin beads. From a process intensification standpoint,
the fact that the foams can release the adsorbed Pu in about half
the number of bed volumes required for the Reillex HPQ means a smaller
volume of hazardous material to handle after the separation and that
the recovered Pu (which is very valuable) is obtained in a more concentrated
form with less loss of material to the dilute head and tail cuts of
the elution. Note that for sample A, the recovered Pu was 12 times
more concentrated than the feed solution.

HPQ and tested polyHIPE materials. (Labels
(A)–(F) refer to the polyHIPE foam samples described in Table 1.)

The bulk capacities of the tested materials are
presented as a
function of volume and mass in Figure 5. It is significant that some of the tested foams exceeded
the capacity of the resin when compared volumetrically because the
foams are about 6 times less dense than the resin. Despite having
much less mass than a similar volume of resin, the polyHIPE could
load 60% more Pu per unit volume than the resin in the case of sample
B. When the materials are compared on a gravimetric basis, the capacity
difference is much more dramatic. Sample C, which demonstrated the
highest Pu capacity per unit mass, had 7.7× the capacity of the
resin. Combined with the separation efficiency of the polyHIPE materials,
the improvement in capacity compared to the resin suggests that these
materials have real potential to significantly improve upon the efficiency
of current Pu separation and purification technologies.

Figure 5 Bulk Pu capacity
of each ion-exchange (IX) material on a volumetric
basis (a) and gravimetric basis (b).

Another important parameter which warranted inquiry is the
maintenance
of ion-exchange capacity over repeated cycles and the stability of
the polyHIPEs in the harsh acid and radiation environments inherent
to this separation. A polyHIPE (sample G) was prepared and subjected
to four loading and elution cycles to study if there was any effect
on the capacity or separation efficiency with repeated use. The loading
and elution curves generated from this testing are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Loading and elution curves
for polyHIPE sample G over four Pu anion-exchange
cycles.

Over the course of four anion-exchange
cycles, the number of bed
volumes until ∼10% breakthrough ranged from about 10 to 12
bed volumes, with the highest capacity exhibited on the first cycle
(determined by number of bed volumes until 10% breakthrough) (Figure 6, left). The three
following cycles had a variability of less than one bed volume at
this level of breakthrough. One explanation for this difference in
Pu adsorbed until breakthrough between the first cycle and the following
cycles is that some amount of Pu loaded during the first cycle remains
bound to the polyHIPE and after this equilibrium is reached the capacity
stabilizes in subsequent cycles. The efficiency of Pu elution is similar
for each sample tested, given there is little change in the width
of the elution profile between each trial (Figure 6, right).

When the bulk capacity of
the column is compared across the four
loading/elution cycles, a similar trend is observed. After the first
cycle, there is a slight decrease in the capacity but the capacity
is recovered for the third and fourth cycles (Figure 7). On the basis of this information, the
hypothesis is that a small amount of the Pu loaded during the first
cycle remains somehow bound to the foam after the first elution but
then some of that may desorb during further cycles until some equilibrium
amount is reached, after which the capacity remains relatively steady.

Figure 7 Bulk Pu
capacity of polyHIPE sample G across four loading/elution
cycles.

The polyHIPE materials were also
evaluated for their stability
to the harsh acid and radiation conditions. Two identical polyHIPE
samples were synthesized, and one was soaked in 8 M nitric acid for
7 weeks and the other was soaked in 8 M nitric acid as well as irradiated
by a Co-60 gamma irradiation source for 7 weeks to a total dose of
approximately 7.8 × 107 rad. It was found that after
about 48 days (approximately 7 weeks) under these conditions, both
polyHIPE monoliths had degraded significantly and could not be tested
for their Pu capacity (Figure S5). It is
worth noting that during the cyclic testing of sample G, the time
elapsed between cycles two and three was about 3 months. During that
time, the polyHIPE had remained saturated with the 0.35 M nitric acid
and based on the testing results detailed above, did not appear to
have degraded or lose an appreciable amount of anion-exchange capacity.
As a result, these materials appear to be relatively stable to the
dilute acid and exposure to radiation over that amount of time. The
ability to store the polyHIPE monolith saturated in dilute nitric
acid between loading cycles is consistent with the common way that
the Reillex HPQ is treated. The resin is generally only saturated
with concentrated nitric acid when it is actively being primed or
loaded with Pu out of caution to avoid potentially violent reactions
between the organic polymer and nitric acid.1

Conclusions
In this work, a new synthetic approach to P4VP-grafted
polyHIPE
materials was explored and their capabilities as ion-exchange media
for Pu separations was evaluated. The ability to incorporate many
NMP initiation sites into the surface of the foam using a functional
comonomer in the initial high internal-phase emulsion enabled the
growth of a brush of P4VP with a sufficient number of ion-exchange
sites to exceed the anion-exchange capacity of a commercial resin
on both a volumetric and gravimetric basis. The exposed nature of
the P4VP brush on the surface of the polyHIPE foam enabled excellent
separation efficiency in the form of narrow elution profiles, and
the purified Pu was obtained in a very concentrated form compared
with the resin. The polyHIPE materials were found to retain their
separation capabilities over the course of four anion-exchange cycles
and were found to be stable for months in dilute nitric acid with
exposure to radiation. On the basis of the results of these experiments,
these polyHIPE materials appear to be a suitable replacement for ion-exchange
resins used in the separation and purification of Pu where higher
efficiency and loading is desired.

Many exciting aspects of
these materials such as their high ion-exchange
capacity per unit mass and excellent separation efficiency indicate
that these materials may have applications in other areas of actinide
science and separations in general. For example, growing a brush of
polymer containing an organophosphorus ligand that can selectively
chelate different actinides may offer an attractive route to separating
or purifying other actinide elements. The high gravimetric capacity
of these polyHIPEs may also allow for high-efficiency capture and
sequestration of radioactive materials or fission products with little
practical use (given the mass of material which would then need to
be sequestered would be very low compared with other sequestration
technologies). Simple tuning of the chemistry of the polymer brush
grown using this synthetic approach to polyHIPEs renders these materials
very versatile and viable alternatives to many existing separation
technologies.

All materials were purchased
from Alfa Aesar, Acros Organics, Millipore Sigma, or McMaster-Carr
and were used as received unless otherwise specified. The inhibitor
was removed from styrene and divinylbenzene (mixed isomers) by passing
each through a column of basic alumina. 4-Vinylpyridine was distilled
under reduced pressure and stored under nitrogen at −30 °C
prior to use. 1H NMR spectroscopy was conducted on a Bruker
AVANCE III-HD 300 MHz NMR spectrometer using CDCl3 as a
solvent. Molecular weight and dispersity of the solution-based polymers
were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). GPC was performed
in high-performance liquid chromatography grade N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) at a flow rate
of 0.8 mL/min at 50 °C on a Varian system equipped with a ProStar
210 pump and a Varian 356-LC RI detector and three 5 μm phenogel
columns (Phenomenex Co.). Samples were analyzed in comparison to narrow
dispersity polystyrene standards. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of the foams were observed with a Zeiss Ultraplus thermal field
emission SEM at an acceleration voltage of 8 kV. Prior to SEM imaging,
the foam samples were rendered conductive via sputter coating for
60 s using a Pd/Au target. Foam compression experiments were performed
at 25 °C using a parallel plate test fixture made of poly(tetrafluoroethylene)-coated
stainless steel on a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) (TA Instruments,
model RSAIII). Elemental analysis was performed at Midwest Microlab,
Indianapolis, IN. Pu concentrations were determined by gamma spectroscopy
using either a Canberra or Ortec high-purity germanium detector instrument.

(1) and 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-1-(phenylmethoxy)-piperidine (2)
Compounds (1) and (2) were synthesized according to a modified literature
procedure.37 A solution of sodium ascorbate
(4 g, 20 mmol) in 40 mL of distilled water was shaken with (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl
(TEMPO) (1.9 g, 12.16 mmol) for 30 min until the TEMPO crystals were
pale yellow in color. The suspension was extracted with 80 mL of diethyl
ether, and the organic layer was washed with water and brine, then
dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated on a rotary
evaporator, yielding an orange oil. Sodium hydride (NaH, 60% dispersion
in mineral oil, 1.05 g, 26 mmol) was added to an oven-dried 100 mL
round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The NaH was
washed 3× with hexanes under nitrogen flow to remove the mineral
oil, then dried briefly under a high flow of nitrogen. Dry DMF (15
mL) was added to the NaH, forming a slurry. The reduced TEMPO was
dissolved in dry DMF and added slowly to the NaH slurry. This mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 1 h; then, 4-vinylbenzyl chloride
(1.15 mL, 8.16 mmol) or benzyl chloride (0.939 mL, 8.16 mmol) was
added via syringe and the reaction mix was stirred overnight under
nitrogen protection. The mixture was slowly quenched with water, then
extracted 2× with diethyl ether (40 mL). The organic layer was
washed 3× with water to remove excess DMF, then brine, then dried
over anhydrous MgSO4, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator.
The product was purified by column chromatography (100% hexanes).

Preparation of PolyHIPE Foam Monoliths
The following
is a general procedure for the synthesis of each polyHIPE foam monolith.
Compound (1) (varying weight percent), styrene (varying weight percent),
and divinylbenzene (0.275 g, 25 wt %) were combined to arrive at a
total monomer mass of 1.1 g (specific formulations of each sample
are detailed in Table S1). The monomers
and sorbitan monooleate (SPAN 80, 0.4 g, 36 wt % relative to monomers)
were combined in a small resin kettle equipped with a glass paddle
stirrer. The aqueous phase, which consisted of distilled water (11
g) and potassium persulfate (K2S2O8, 0.15 g), was added to a dropwise addition funnel. The aqueous phase
was slowly added to the stirring oil phase (350 rpm) over the course
of 15 min. After complete addition of the aqueous phase, the resulting
emulsion was allowed to be stirred for an additional 5 min. The prepared
emulsion was carefully deposited via syringe into thin glass tubing
(sealed on one end) and cured in an oven overnight at 70 °C.
The foam monoliths were removed from the glass tubes by carefully
breaking the glass, then washed for 24 h in a Soxhlet extractor (ethanol
was used as the extraction solvent). The monoliths were dried in a
70 °C oven overnight and stored in plastic for further use.

Surface-Initiated Nitroxide-Mediated Polymerization of P4VP
on PolyHIPE Monoliths
A foam monolith weighing approximately
0.05 g was placed into a 50 mL Schlenk flask along with a small magnetic
stir bar. The flask was sealed with a rubber septum (secured with
copper wire), and the foam monolith was deoxygenated by evacuating
and backfilling the flask with nitrogen five times. In a separate
50 mL Schlenk flask, 4-vinylpyridine (7.5 mL, 30 vol %) and n-butanol (17.5 mL, 70 vol %) were combined and degassed
by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles. On the last cycle,
the flask was backfilled with nitrogen. The thawed liquid mixture
was transferred via a gas-tight syringe to the flask containing the
foam monolith (the foam readily soaks up the monomer mixture). The
reaction mixture was heated at 130 °C for varying time intervals
while stirring. The resulting polymer-grafted polyHIPE monolith was
washed for 24 h in a Soxhlet extractor (ethanol was used as the extraction
solvent), then dried in a 70 °C oven.

Assembly of PolyHIPE Anion-Exchange
Column Prototypes
Small column prototypes used for testing
under flow conditions were
prepared according to the following procedure. The prepared polyHIPE
monolith was coated in Devcon HP250 (a chemically resistant, high-strength
epoxy) and immediately encased in a layer of high-strength heat shrink
tubing. The tubing was shrunk, and the epoxy was cured overnight.
This process sealed the tubing to the monolith, minimizing the possibility
of channeling around the monolith. Any excess epoxy was sliced off
the ends of the monolith with a pristine razor blade so that liquid
flow was not inhibited through the foam. Two more layers of heat shrink
tubing were added so that the encased monolith fit snugly into the
end of hose connectors that were attached with more Devcon HP250 epoxy.
The assembly was tested by flowing water through it to ensure there
were no leaks prior to testing. Specific column dimensions for each
sample are shown in Table S1 and an image
of some of the prepared prototypes is shown in Figure S6.

Plutonium Adsorption and Elution Studies
Pu sorption
and elution properties of the prepared polyHIPE foam column prototypes
were studied using a feed solution of ∼4 g/L Pu in 8 M nitric
acid (data for each sample is normalized for the precisely determined
feed concentration for comparison between samples). These conditions
approximate the conditions of the Pu separation of the HB-line process
at the Savannah River Site. The feed solution was prepared by treating
stock Pu solution with ascorbic acid to reduce all Pu(IV) to Pu(III).
The acid concentration was then adjusted to 8 M, and the Pu(III) was
oxidized to Pu(IV), forming the [Pu(NO3)6]2– complex that readily loads onto quaternized pyridine
anion-exchange sites (for the purpose of this testing, the feed solution
contained on Pu and no other major contaminants). Each prepared column
was conditioned with approximately 10 mL of 8 M nitric acid at a flow
rate of 0.75 mL/min (using a programmable syringe pump) to protonate
the pyridine groups and to remove any water or dilute nitric acid
from the column. The prepared Pu feed solution was then fed at 0.5
mL/min, and 1 mL aliquots were collected until breakthrough of the
Pu feed was visually observed. The columns were washed with 10 mL
of 8 M nitric acid at 0.75 mL/min to remove any unbound impurities,
and the adsorbed Pu was eluted with 0.35 M nitric acid at a flow rate
of 0.5 mL/min, collecting 1 mL aliquots until elution was complete.
The results of the tested polyHIPE materials were compared to the
those of a similarly scaled glass column packed with Reillex HPQ resin,
which was tested according to the procedure detailed above. An image
of the testing setup is shown in Figure S7.

DMA Compression Testing of PolyHIPEs
In a typical experiment,
a predetermined compressive force (pounds per square inch, psi) was
applied to a small section of foam for varying durations (see Figure S1) during which sample thickness (% strain)
was measured as a function of time. This was followed by removal of
the force and observation of the strain recovery for 15 min.

Solution-Based
Kinetic Study of (2)
Compound (2) (0.1
g, 1 equiv), 4-vinylpyridine (8.7 mL, 200 equiv), and n-butanol (20.3 mL) were added to a 50 mL Schlenk flask equipped with
a 1 in. stir bar, a glass stopcock, and rubber septum. The flask was
sealed, and the reaction mix was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles, then backfilled with nitrogen. The flask was heated to 130
°C while stirring, and aliquots of the reaction solution were
taken at varying time intervals and analyzed by 1H NMR
for reaction conversion information. The remainder of the aliquots
were precipitated in diethyl ether, and the polymer was recovered
by centrifugation. Molecular weight and dispersity characteristics
of the polymer samples were determined by GPC analysis in DMF.
