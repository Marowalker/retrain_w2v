The effect of oxygen vacancies (VO) on α-Fe2O3 (110) facet on the
performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is researched
by both experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
The experimental results manifest that the enhancement in photocurrent
density by the presence of VO is related with increased
charge separation and charge-transfer efficiencies. The electrochemical
analysis reveals that the sample with VO demonstrates an
enhanced carrier density and reduced charge-transfer resistance. The
results of DFT calculation indicate that the better charge separation
is also contributed by the decrease of potential on the VO surface, which improves the hole transport from the bulk to the
surface. The reduced charge-transfer resistance is owing to the greatly
increased number of active sites. The current study provides important
insight into the roles of VO on α-Fe2O3 photoanode, especially on its surface catalysis. The generated
lesson is also helpful for the improvement of other PEC photoanode
materials.

==== Body
1 Introduction
A photoelectrochemical
(PEC) water-splitting cell can convert electromagnetic energy into
storable chemical energy without causing pollution in the process.
Among the photoanode materials for PEC, hematite (α-Fe2O3) has received much attention as an efficient, robust,
and inexpensive photoelectrode material for on-demand oxygen production.1 Since Hardee et al. first used Fe2O3 for water splitting in 1976, considerable effort has
been devoted to improve its activity through doping,2−6 heterojunction formation,7,8 morphology control,9−12 and so forth. However, there is still a long way to go because of
its poor conductivity, low flat band potential, short diffusion length,
and large overpotential for water oxidation.13

The past researches on photocatalytic materials have found
that manipulating crystalline defects is as important as the morphology
control. Defects engineering has thus become an attractive avenue
for improving the energy-harvesting performance along with other conventional
approaches. Oxygen vacancy (VO) is one of the most important
defects in metal oxides. Recent experimental results indicate that
VO on the surface can enhance electron transport.14−24 It has been found that VO can improve the PEC efficiency
by increasing the density and mobility of holes for improved electron–hole
separation.25 For Fe2O3, Ling et al. found the performance of pristine hematite nanorod
to be greatly enhanced because of the formation of VO by
thermal treatment in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere.26 Dieckmann pointed out that VO is the dominant
ionic defect in hematite on the basis of electrical conductance data.27 Chen et al. observed two types of VO in Fe2O3 nanowires and nanobelts (33̅0)
and (11̅2) facets.28 Apart from the
experimental work, the effect of VO on the electronic structure
was also researched theoretically. Warschkow et al. found that it
is thermodynamically possible for a higher concentration of VO to exist on the surface than in the bulk.29 It was also found that the presence of Au particles, especially
semi-oxidized Au, can remarkably reduce the formation energy of VO on the α-Fe2O3(001) surface.30 Song et al. indicated that VO on
the α-Fe2O3(001) surface greatly strengthens
the adsorption of NO and H2O2, which can largely
improve the ability of H2O2 decomposition.31 Despite the fact that VO on Fe2O3 has received considerable attention recently,
most of them focused on the electronic property. As known, the oxygen
evolution reaction (OER) is an energetically uphill process.32−34 However, information on VO on the α-Fe2O3 (110) facet that induced charge transport and separation
during the water-splitting process is still missing from the literature.
Therefore, a detailed knowledge about charge distribution on defect-free
or VO-containing surfaces is necessary for a fundamental
understanding of the effect of VO.35 In the present study, a systematic experimental and quantum chemical
simulation on the roles of VO is presented using α-Fe2O3 nanorod with exposed (110) facets. The experimental
results indicate that VO on the α-Fe2O3 (110) facet has indeed increased the activity of OER. Theoretical
analysis found that VO can enhance hole transport and increase
the transfer efficiency by reducing the potential and increasing the
density of the active sites.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Microstructure of Fe2O3 Thin Films
Nanorod-structured α-Fe2O3 thin films
with a thickness of 500 nm were prepared (Figure 1a,b). The selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) patterns and the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) images suggest that the exposed facet for this nanorod is
the (110) plane. X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 1e) shows that this material belongs to hematite
(PDF#33-0664). The main peak belongs to the (110) plane, which also
confirms the TEM results that the nanorod grows along the [110] direction.
No impurity peaks were present except the FTO (SnO2) substrate.
Moreover, the crystal structure was not changed after the nitrogen
treatment. Figure 1f shows the chemical state of O 1s by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Both samples have the same binding energy at 529.6 eV, assigned
to the lattice oxygen. A shoulder peak at 531.0 eV appears for the
N2-treated sample. This is an evidence for the existence
of VO on the α-Fe2O3(001) surface.36,37

2.2 OER Performance
of Fe2O3 Thin Films
Figure 2a manifests the photocurrents
of α-Fe2O3 with and without a hole scavenger.
Before the nitrogen treatment, the maximum photocurrent density for
defect-free α-Fe2O3 was around 0.016 mA·cm–2 at 1.23 VRHE, whereas the one after nitrogen
treatment was around 0.038 mA·cm–2, which corresponds
to a 137% increase. As shown in Figure 2a,b, the oxidation photocurrents in the Na2SO3 solution are significantly enhanced after the N2 treatment. This implies that the N2 treatment
mainly alters the bulk charge separation. Further quantitative analysis
will be given and discussed next.

AM 1.5 G solar simulator illumination. Solid lines are photocurrents
and dotted lines are dark currents.

As shown in Table 1, the charge separation efficiency of α-Fe2O3 annealed in air is only about 1.1% at 1.23 VRHE, whereas that of α-Fe2O3 annealed in
N2 is about 2.2%. The charge-transfer efficiency of α-Fe2O3 is about 8.7% at 1.23 VRHE and that
of α-Fe2O3 annealed in N2 is
about 15.2%. As a result, the improved performance is contributed
by both increased hole separation and transfer. The amounts of generated
H2 and O2 are listed in Figure S1.

Mott–Schottky
plots of α-Fe2O3 after N2 and
air heat treatment were used to estimate the electron density (Figure 3a) by eq 1(38) 1  where e0, ε, and ε0 are the
electron charge with a value of 1.60 × 10–19 C, dielectric constant with a value of 80,39 and permittivity of vacuum with a value of 8.85 × 10–12 F·m–1, respectively. A, Nd, V, and C are the area of the α-Fe2O3 film, the
charge carrier density, the bias applied on the electrode, and the
surface capacitance, respectively. Although this equation is used
for planar electrodes and may not provide a precise quantitative analysis
for the nanorod structure, comparison between the treated and untreated
samples would still provide an indication of the change of carrier
density because of the presence of VO. Our analysis indicates
the carrier densities after air and N2 heat treatment to
be 3.2 × 1019 and 4.6 × 1019 cm–3, respectively. Therefore, N2 heat treatment
enhances the carrier density because of the generation of VO. 2

of α-Fe2O3 with the frequency range from
1 to 105 Hz before and after N2 heat treatment
at 0.23 V vs Ag/AgCl under 1 Sun illumination.

The VO concentration, nc, of α-Fe2O3 is determined by the oxygen
partial pressure, pO2, as nc ∝ pO2–1/6.40 Thus,
nitrogen treatment introduces VO because of the low pO2. It was reported that VO can be generated in α-Fe2O3 when annealed
in argon or nitrogen gas.36 According to eq 2, the generation of VO will induce more free electrons. Thus, VO can
be considered as a shallow donor for α-Fe2O3.41−43

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to characterize
hole transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface. Figure 3b shows the EIS data
of α-Fe2O3 after air and N2 heat treatment. An equivalent circuit (Figure 3b) was used to fit the EIS data, where Rs is the solution resistance; Rtrap denotes the resistance of the surface state trapping
holes; Css represents the capacitance
from the surface states; and Rss denotes
the charge-transfer resistance. The result indicates that Rtrap after the air treatment is about 6.7 ×
103 Ω, whereas that after the N2 treatment
is 3.4 Ω (details in Table S1). Therefore,
we can conclude that the number of hole-trapping surface states is
greatly decreased after the N2 heat treatment. On the basis
of the above analysis, VO not only affects the conductivity
but also has an effect on the surface states. Thus, further analysis
is needed to understand how VO affects the charge separation
and charge-transfer processes.

2.3 Geometric
and Electronic Characteristics of α-Fe2O3
The geometric and electronic properties of optimized α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3 (110)
facet, with or without VO, are displayed in Figure 4.

structures of bulk α-Fe2O3, α-Fe2O3 (110) facet, and α-Fe2O3 (110) facet with VO. The formation energy of VO is also manifested. (b) PDOS of bulk α-Fe2O3 and bulk α-Fe2O3 with VO and (c) PDOS of α-Fe2O3 (110)
facet and α-Fe2O3 (110) facet with VO. (d) Calculated edges relative to the NHE potential at pH
= 0, where the charge-transport process on the surface is also added;
Fe, O, and VO atoms are shown as blue, red, and hollow
yellow spheres. More details about the potential can be found in the
Supporting Information (Figure S2).

As indicated in Figure 4a, the concentration of VO is 1.4% for the 2 × 2 × 1 supercells of α-Fe2O3, and the surface coverage of VO is
17% for the 2 × 1 supercells of the α-Fe2O3 (110) surface. There are one type of VO on the
bulk and two types of VO on the (110) surface because all
O on the bulk α-Fe2O3 are connected with
four Fe neighbors and form a tetrahedron (denoted as VO0), whereas some of the surface O have coordination number 2 (denoted
as VO1) and some have coordination number 3 (denoted as
VO2). The formation energies of VO1 and VO2 are much smaller than that of VO0, which means
that VO can be easily formed on the α-Fe2O3 (110) surface when compared with the bulk. Furthermore,
it was found that the formation energy of VO on the α-Fe2O3 (110) facet is smaller than that on the TiO2 (110) facets (3.55 eV).44 As well-known,
TiO2 can easily generate VO, which means VO can also be easily formed on the α-Fe2O3 (110) facet. The band structure of bulk α-Fe2O3 and bulk α-Fe2O3 + VO are presented as partial density of states (PDOS) plots,
as shown in Figure 4b. It shows that the valence band maximum is mainly composed of Fe
3d and O 2p resonance peaks, whereas the conduction band minimum is
largely constituted by Fe 3d orbits. This means that the electrons
are generated from the bond of Fe 3d and O 2p orbitals to the bond
of Fe 3d orbitals, and this behavior will generate photogenerated
holes on the valence band maximum. Furthermore, VO in bulk
α-Fe2O3 will greatly change the band structure.
As shown in Figure 4b, the VO defects in bulk α-Fe2O3 will introduce two deep-level states in the band gap. Empirically,
a midgap ground state can be considered as a recombination center
(the Shockley–Read–Hall effect).45 Therefore, the VO defects in the bulk α-Fe2O3 will shorten the lifetime of the generated holes.
Fortunately, the formation energy for VO generation in
the bulk α-Fe2O3 is very high; therefore,
in practical terms, the density of such defects will be low. On the
surfaces, the Fermi levels of the α-Fe2O3 (110) facets, with and without VO, are located at the
valence band maximum (Figure 4c). This means that the electron carrier density is not greatly
improved by the presence of VO on the surface. Furthermore,
the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential indicates that the surface
potential for the α-Fe2O3 (110) + VO facet is greatly reduced, as indicated in Figure 4d. It reveals that holes can
be easily transferred from the defect-free surface to the defect surface.
Therefore, the enhanced charge separation mainly comes from the potential
change on the surface. A similar finding was reported in the BiVO4(010) facet.46

2.4 Adsorption Properties of α-Fe2O3
The energy change, ΔG, for the adsorption of OH (denoted
as @OH) is lower than the ideal catalysis, indicating OH is easily
adsorbed on the α-Fe2O3 (110) surface.
The high adsorption energies of @OH make it difficult to lose a H
adatom and generate O adatom. Therefore, the rate-determining step
is the loss of H adatom for @OH, except for the VO2 TopFe1
site. For the TopFe1 site, the rate-determining step is the loss of
H adatom on another H2O to form @OOH. No matter which step
is the determining step, the theoretical overpotential can be adopted
to assess the OER activity. Figure 5a shows the bridge site Fe1Fe1, bridge site Fe2Fe2,
and top site Fe1, which are the active sites for the clean α-Fe2O3 surface, with an overpotential of 0.97, 1.16,
and 1.01 V, respectively. After introducing VO on the surface,
the overpotential increases on some active sites such as the bridge
Fe1Fe1 and bridge Fe2Fe2, whereas it decreases on the top Fe1 site
(Figure 5b,c). The
overpotentials for the defect-free, VO1, site, and VO2 sites are 1.05, 0.97, and 0.91 V, respectively. Considering
the errors in this type of calculation, it can be concluded that on
average, the overpotentials for the defect-free surface and the VO surface are very close to each other. This is consistent
with the experimental evidence in Figure 2 that the onset potentials of the samples
treated in air and nitrogen atmosphere are close to each other.

Figure 5 Free energy
profiles and adsorption structures of OER on different surfaces on
different active sites, where green spheres indicate the active sites,
and Fe (blue), O (red), and H (white) atoms are shown in colored spheres:
(a) clean α-Fe2O3 (110), (b) α-Fe2O3 (110) with VO1, and (c) α-Fe2O3 (110) with VO2. The unit of overpotential
is V. More details are obtained from Tables S2–S4 and Figure S3.

The presence of VO was found to be able to increase
the stable adsorption sites. The bridge Fe2Fe2 and top Fe2 sites on
the VO1 surface have become active in the presence of VO. Thus, we understand that the main function of VO is to generate more active sites on the surface (experimentally,
this has increased the photocurrent density by about 137%). Comparing
the Gibbs free energy, it clearly indicates that the OER on the α-Fe2O3 (110) surface is mainly determined by R1–R2
because the slope of this process is higher than that of an ideal
catalysis process. On the basis of the above analyses, the mechanism
of improved photocurrent by N2 treatment is mainly attributed
to the generated VO on the surface. The VO on
the surface can greatly improve the surface potential and then improve
the hole transfer on the surface. Furthermore, the presence of VO also increased the density of the active sites. These two
reasons can reasonably explain the improved performance of photocurrent
by N2 treatment on the α-Fe2O3 (110) surface.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we carried out comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies
on the roles of VO on α-Fe2O3 (110) photoanode. The experimental results indicate that N2 treatment has enhanced the photocurrent significantly. The enhancement
mainly comes from a better charge separation and an enhanced surface
charge transfer. Combining the experimental results with the density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that the improved charge
separation is contributed by the increased electron density and the
surface potential change. The enhanced surface charge transfer is
mainly because of the increased density of active sites. This research
provides improved insights into the roles of VO on surface
catalysis.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Preparation
of Fe2O3 Thin Films
Pristine Fe2O3 film electrodes were prepared by a hydrothermal
method. A 0.49 g FeCl3 and 1.70 g NaNO3 were
added into a 20 mL aqueous solution and then transferred onto a Teflon
vial with a capacity of 40 mL. A proper amount of HCl with 3.7% concentration
was added to adjust the pH value. A piece of glass substrate with
a fluorine-doped SnO2 coating was covered by a thermal
tape with half of the conductive side exposed and placed inside the
vial. After heating at 95 °C for 6 h, the vessel was cooled to
room temperature, and the obtained thin-film electrode was washed
by using deionized water and then heated under ambient environment
at 700 °C for 20 min to obtain a layer of Fe2O3 nanorods. The nitrogen treatment was performed at 500 °C
for 2 h with a pure nitrogen gas flow rate of 50 sccm in a vacuumed
tube furnace.

4.2 Characterization
The hematite nanorod film electrodes’ morphologies and thickness
were recorded on a field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL
JSM-7600F). The powder XRD data were characterized by a Shimadzu 6000
X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm).
The SAED patterns were recorded using a transmission electron microscope
(JEOL JEM-2010F). The light absorption was measured with a UV–vis–near-infrared
spectrophotometer (LAMBDA 950, PerkinElmer). A conventional three-electrode
system (PCI4/300 potentiostat, Gamry Electronic Instruments, Inc.)
was used for the photocurrent measurement, where hematite film is
the working electrode, Pt mesh is the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl
is the reference electrode. The light source was an AM 1.5G solar
simulator (HAL-320, Asahi Spectra Co., Ltd.) with an intensity of
100 mW·cm–2 calibrated by a solar reference
cell. The illumination area was 0.28 cm2 in 1 M NaOH aqueous
(pH = 13.6) solution with a scan rate of 30 mV·s–1. An Autolab potentiostat–galvanostat (Autolab PGSTAT302 N)
was employed to measure the electrochemical impedance spectra and
Mott–Schottky plots.

The photocurrent of water oxidation
(JH2O) is indicated in eq 3(47) 3  where J0 is the theoretical solar photocurrent (12.5 mA·cm–2 for Fe2O3).48 ηabs, ηsep, and ηtran are the efficiency of light absorption, charge separation,
and interfacial charge transfer, respectively.

To quantitatively
analyze the contributions, Na2SO3 was utilized
to suppress the charge recombination on the surface. ηtrans can be considered as 1 when hole scavenger Na2SO3 is added. Thus, the Na2SO3 oxidation
photocurrent is determined by eq 4 4  where JNa2SO3 is the measured photocurrent in Na2SO3 solution. On the basis of the light absorption efficiencies, Jabs is about 11.3 mA·cm2 for
our α-Fe2O3, as shown in Figure S4. From eqs 3 and 4, ηsep = JNa2SO3/Jabs and ηtran = JH2O/JNa2SO3.

5 Computational Details
The DFT simulations of generalized gradient approximation and the
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional were used in the CASTEP
module. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
method is adopted as the quasi-Newton optimization technique. The
partially filled and strongly correlated localized d electrons of
Fe were treated using Hubbard U-corrections with U(V) = 2.5 eV.49,50 The expression for dispersion correction is calculated by the method
of Tkatchenko and Scheffler. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials in reciprocal
space were used with an energy cutoff of 340 eV and a self-consistent
field tolerance of 1.0 × 10–6 eV·atom–1, where the valence electron configurations were set
as Fe-3d64s2, O-2s22p4. The structure optimization was finished when the energy, force,
and displacement were smaller than 1.0 × 10–5 eV·atom–1, 0.03 eV·Å–1, 0.05 GPa, and 0.001 Å. α-Fe2O3 (space group 167) and the corresponding 1 × 2 (110) facet with
five layers and a vacuum region of 15 Å were constructed. These
numbers of layers were found to be sufficient for the convergence
of the final result on the basis of surface energy calculations (Figure S5). The 3 × 3 × 2 and 2 ×
1 × 1 k-points sampling was adopted for the
bulk and surface calculations, and the optimized structure is consistent
with previous results (Table S5).

The formation energy of VO (Evf) and the adsorption energy (Eads) can
be calculated through eqs 5 and 6 5   6  where Eds, Eps, EO2, Emolecule+surface, Emolecule, and Esurface are the optimized energies
of the defective surface, perfect surface, O2 molecule
in gas state, surface with the adsorbent, adsorption molecules, and
the surface, respectively.51

As known,
the water-splitting process can happen with the R1–R4 reaction
paths, where * represents a surface site.52,53 7   8   9   10  

The standard
Gibbs free energy of R1–R4 is obtained by 11 11   12   13   14  

The theoretical overpotential is expressed
as 15  where ΔGO, ΔGOH, ΔGOOH, and ΔGO, are the
adsorption energies of the corresponding adsorbates, including contributions
from the vibrational energy and entropy at 300 K. The details of the
calculation can be found in our previous paper.54
