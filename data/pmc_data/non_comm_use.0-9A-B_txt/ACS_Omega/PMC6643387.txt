Conducting polymers are routinely
used in optoelectronic biomaterials,
but large polymer polydispersity and poor aqueous compatibility complicate
integration with biomolecular templates and development of discrete
and defined supramolecular complexes. Herein, we report on a chiro-optical
hybrid material generated by the self-assembly of an anionic peptide
and a chemically defined cationic pentameric thiophene in aqueous
environment. The peptide acts as a stereochemical template for the
thiophene and adopts an α-helical conformation upon association,
inducing optical activity in the thiophene π–π*
transition region. Theoretical calculations confirm the experimentally
observed induced structural changes and indicate the importance of
electrostatic interactions in the complex. The association process
is also probed at the substrate–solvent interface using peptide-functionalized
gold nanoparticles, indicating that the peptide can also act as a
scaffold when immobilized, resulting in structurally well-defined
supramolecular complexes. The hybrid complex could rapidly be assembled,
and the kinetics of the formation could be monitored by utilizing
the local surface plasmon resonance originating from the gold nanoparticles.
We foresee that these findings will aid in designing novel hybrid
materials and provide a possible route for the development of functional
optoelectronic interfaces for both biomaterials and energy harvesting
applications.

Introduction
The introduction of
chiral optoelectronic functionality into biomacromolecules
offers a route to produce hybrid materials for a wide range of bioelectronic
applications including electroactive scaffolds for tissue engineering,
artificial enzymes, and biosensing.1−4 The optoelectronic components can either
be conjugated directly to the macromolecular template,5 limiting the structural and molecular diversity and increasing
the synthetic effort, or be introduced via self-assembly which offers
a more scalable and flexible approach.6 Conducting polymers (CPs) are routinely used as the optoelectronic
component because of their many attractive properties, including excellent
light harvesting capability, good photostability, conductivity- and
conformation-dependent absorption, and fluorescence.4,7,8 However, most CPs reported so
far are only compatible with organic solvents because the π-conjugated
backbones are typically functionalized with hydrophobic side chains.
The poor water solubility complicates the processing of the materials
as well as their implementation in biological applications.4 Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs), on the other
hand, contain ionic side chains resulting in good solubility in highly
polar media while maintaining excellent optical and electronic function.9,10 However, both CPs and CPEs are often generated from random polymerization
of different monomeric building blocks resulting in polydisperse materials
with randomized positioning of the distinct side-chain functionalities.
The lack of chemical precision at the molecular level can limit and
restrict the optoelectronic performance of the materials. In contrast,
a novel class of conformation-sensitive optical dyes, so-called luminescent-conjugated
oligothiophenes (LCOs), combines water solubility with a highly defined
chemical structure.11 LCOs can be applied
as selective and specific ligands for various biomolecular targets
and have been employed for investigating numerous different biological
phenomena, such as formation of disease-associated protein aggregates
and for labeling of distinct cell types.12,13 The association of LCOs to proteins and peptides can trigger changes
in the LCO backbone conformation resulting in alterations in optical
properties which enables identification of the conformational states
of the biomolecules.14,15 In addition, LCO binding to small
biomimetic polypeptides can trigger folding of the peptides leading
to induced chirality of the LCO.16 Peptides
can thus act as structurally well-defined scaffolds for binding of
LCOs in a preferred molecular arrangement to generate distinct chiro-optical
hybrid materials. The possibilities to design and synthesize peptides
that can provide both charge complementarity and tailored hydrophobic
interactions to match the LCO make peptides ideal candidates as interactional
and structural scaffolds. Peptides can also be tethered to inorganic
surfaces such as gold, silver, platinum, titanium oxide, and zinc
sulfide, using various sequence specific interactions,17−22 offering a straightforward approach for immobilization and organization
of the molecular optoelectronic material on a solid substrate.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) display many attractive physical and
chemical properties, such as large optical extinction coefficient
in the visible-to-near infrared wavelength range and high chemical
stability. These properties are of large relevance in design of optoelectronic
materials with tunable properties for applications in energy harvesting,
molecular and organic electronics, and biosensing.23−25 The optical
properties of AuNPs depend on the conditions for the localized surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR), which in turn depend on nanoparticle size
and shape, interparticle separation, and dielectric properties of
the surrounding medium.26 The size and
shape of the AuNPs can be tuned by a wide range of synthesis strategies,
whereas the interparticle separation depends on colloidal stability,
which in turn can be modulated by means of the nanoparticle surface
chemistry. Changes in colloidal stability triggered by molecular interactions
occurring at the particle surface–solvent interface is often
employed as a transduction mechanism in colorimetric AuNP-based biosensors.27 The LSPR response from immobilized AuNPs is
typically less pronounced but can provide direct information about
the dielectric properties of the surrounding medium. Immobilized AuNPs
can hence be used to probe molecular interaction occurring in the
near vicinity of the particle surface in real-time.26 AuNPs are thus a good model system for studying molecular
interactions and are used in this work to probe the peptide–LCO
complex formation at a solid interface.

We have previously studied
the self-assembly of anionic LCOs and
oligothiophenes with a cationic peptide (JR2K), with focus on how
the positioning of electrostatic interactions induce chirality in
optically inactive thiophenes.16 In this
paper, we utilize our previous findings to induce optical activity
in a cationic LCO by self-assembling it with a de novo designed negatively
charged polypeptide (JR2E) while bound to a substrate. The LCO is
an optically inactive pentameric thiophene with two methylated imidazole
groups as substituents (p-HTMI) (Figure 1A) and was originally developed as a probe
for the detection of cancer associated cells.12,28 The anionic polypeptide JR2E is a glutamic-acid-rich 42 residue
de novo designed helix–loop–helix polypeptide with a
net charge of −5 at neutral pH (Figure 1B). JR2E is random coil at pH 7 but fold
and homodimerize into a four helix bundle at acidic pH (pH < 6)
or in the presence of mM concentration of Zn2+ ions.29,30 The peptide JR2EC is identical to JR2E but has a cysteine residue
in position 22 in the loop region instead of a Val, which enables
immobilization of JR2EC on AuNPs without significantly effecting dimerization
and folding.31 In solution, the self-assembly
of this anionic peptide and the cationic LCO counterpart (Figure 1C) formed structurally
well-defined optically active supramolecular complexes. In addition,
we further used the peptide to anchor the LCO onto both suspended
and immobilized AuNPs and utilized the changes in interparticle separation
as well as the refractive index sensitivity of the AuNPs to study
the complex formation on the particle surface. As the possibility
to utilize peptide-based scaffolds and molecular self-assembly is
an attractive route for the development of hybrid materials with novel
optoelectronic properties, we foresee that our findings will aid in
the chemical design of novel hybrid materials for organic bioelectronics.

Results and Discussion
Optical Characterization
of Peptide–LCO Interactions
The association of the
peptide JR2E with the LCO p-HTMI was verified
using several optical techniques. We first investigated the extinction
profile of p-HTMI in the presence of JR2E and observed a distinct
red shift from 383 to 394 nm and a decrease in absorption with increasing
concentrations of JR2E (Figure 2A). The red shift reached saturation at a JR2E–p-HTMI
ratio of 1:2, as can be seen in the mole fraction plot (Figure S1). The extinction of p-HTMI is highly
dependent on the π–π* transition region derived
from the main chain, and the induced red shift indicates a planarization
and an increased effective conjugation length of the thiophene backbone.
By using this induced red shift and plotting the ratio of the intensity
for the excitation maximum for bound (393 nm) and unbound (383 nm)
p-HTMI for different concentrations of JR2E, a binding curve could
be generated (Figure 2A inset). Fitting of the binding curve to a sigmoidal function (Hill1
function) resulted in an estimated dissociation constant of 7.3 μM
which is similar to the previously observed values for binding of
anionic LCOs to a cationic peptide.16 The
emission spectra of the interaction showed a similar trend as the
extinction with an increasing red shift and decrease in intensity
with increasing concentrations of JR2E, reaching saturation at peptide
concentrations at, or above, that of the LCO (≥30 μM, Figure 2B), further confirming
the formation of a complex.

(0–60 μM). Scattering intensity (E) and resulting correlation

CD measurements were used to probe
for induced structural changes
as the complex was formed. As reported previously, JR2E exists as
a random coil at neutral pH with a negative band at 195–200
nm, which is typical for unordered polypeptides. When JR2E was mixed
with p-HTMI, the polypeptide adopted a distinct α-helical secondary
structure with two negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm in the CD spectra
that were more pronounced when the concentration of p-HMTI increased
(Figure 2C). To provide
a reference point for the maximum amount of folding possible for the
peptide, JR2E was treated with TFE as a cosolvent, to enhance and
stabilize the secondary structure (Figure S2).32 The helicity of the peptide, which
can be described by the ratio of the ellipticities at 222 and 208
nm, was comparable to JR2E treated with TFE at a p-HTMI–JR2E
ratio of 3:1 (Figure 2C inset). This correlates well with the extinction/emission spectra
that showed a saturation of the red shift corresponding to the planarization
of the p-HTMI backbone at a similar ratio. Previous studies have shown
that JR2E can homodimerize and form four helix bundles at acidic pH
(below pH 6) when the abundant Glu residues become protonated, which
decrease the intermolecular charge repulsion.30 Its plausible that homodimerization also occurred due to the association
with the cationic p-HTMI because of screening of destabilizing charge
interactions, allowing the peptide component to assemble into four
helix bundles resulting in a structure with more prominent helicity.
We further used CD in the visible region to characterize p-HTMI which
lack optically active substituents and thus failed to produce a CD
pattern on its own (Figure 2D). However, in the presence of JR2E, an induced distinct
pattern emerged with increasing concentrations of the peptide. The
induced chirality seemed to reach saturation at a ratio of two peptides
per LCO. The induced CD is most probably derived from the single chain
chirality of the conjugated thiophene backbone as the cationic methylated
imidazole groups interact with anionic residues in the peptide affording
a chiral template. Thus, the self-assembly of the peptide and the
LCOs generated a hybrid complex with unique chiro-optical and structural
properties.

Next, DLS was used to investigate the size of the
helical chiro-optical
complexes formed and dependency of the peptide and LCO stoichiometry
(Figure 2E,F). Separately,
both the peptide and the LCO produced very low scattering intensities,
and the corresponding correlation functions showed no trace of larger
assemblies, clearly showing that both constituents are well solubilized
in an aqueous environment. When mixed at different ratios, the intensities
increased only slightly, where ratios of JR2E–p-HTMI of 1:1
and 2:1 produced identical scattering intensities and correlation
functions, whereas a 2:1 ratio resulted in slightly higher intensities.
Overall, the DLS measurements indicate the formation of well-defined
complexes without any large aggregates in an aqueous environment.

Theoretical Calculations of Peptide–LCO Interactions
MD simulations of the peptide and LCO interactions were used to
probe the dynamics of the formed complex (Figure 1C) and to get an in depth understanding of
the binding site coordination. Binding site analysis suggests that
binding occurs mostly because of electrostatic interactions between
the cationic methylated imidazole group of p-HTMI and the anionic
residues of which the most significant are Glu 6, Glu 10, Glu 28,
Glu 32, and Glu 39 (Figure S3). van der
Waals interactions also seem important through nonpolar residues such
as Ala 24, Ala 41, Leu 5, and Leu 31 as well as π–π
interactions between the aromatic ring of Phe 35 and the conjugated
backbone of p-HTMI (Figure S4). Furthermore,
the interaction with the p-HTMI seems to stabilize the folded structure
of JR2E as can be seen from the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)
of the polypeptide backbone during the MD simulation (Figure S5). The RMSD values of free JR2E are
all higher than the JR2E–p-HTMI complex, illustrating that
the binding conformations of polypeptide are less dynamic and the
presence of p-HTMI stabilized the folded peptide structure. To investigate
the influence of the LCO on homodimerization and the formation of
a four-helix bundle between two peptides, two additional systems were
modeled consisting of two peptides with (2*JR2E + p-HTMI) and without
p-HTMI (2*JR2E). Reviewing the whole trajectories of the simulations
using visual molecular dynamics33 showed
that in the absence of the LCO, the two peptide components failed
to form prolonged interactions and only interacted sporadically throughout
the simulation (Figure 3A). In the presence of p-HTMI, the homodimer was stabilized, locking
the peptides together after initial binding of all components in the
system and remaining stable during the residual simulation time (Figure 3B).

Figure 3 Snapshots of the system
of 2*JR2E (A) and 2*JR2E + p-HTMI (B) at
different time points during MD simulation. JR2E is represented in
yellow and gray ribbons, and p-HTMI and TsO– are
in red and blue, respectively.

To further characterize the influence of p-HTMI on the homodimerization
of two monomers of JR2E, the distances between three pairs of residues
placed within the two monomers were calculated throughout the simulations
(Figure 4). The residues
selected in the first monomer were located at positions 1, 21, and
42 and paired with 21, 21, and 32 in the second monomer, respectively.
The distance between the selected residues was calculated both in
the presence and the absence of p-HTMI, and the results show that
the presence of the LCO decreased the distance for each of the system
trajectories. Both the 1–21 (Figure 4A) and 21–21 (Figure 4B) systems formed stable complexes in the
presence of p-HTMI already at ∼25 000 ps which lasted throughout
the simulation. The 42–32 system formed a stable complex after
∼50 000 ps, which is to be expected because the selected residues
are located near the more dynamic N-terminals of the peptide monomers
(Figure 4C).

Peptide–LCO Complex
Formation on Colloidal AuNPs
Both optical characterization
and MD simulations thus show that the
peptide indeed can function as a scaffold, orientating and inducing
optical activity in the LCO. In addition, the peptide and LCO and
the final supramolecular hybrid material display excellent solubility
in an aqueous environment without the formation of large aggregates
which is promising for further development of highly defined biocompatible
optoelectronic devices. We further went on to investigate if the peptide
could be used as a structural scaffold to anchor the LCO onto a solid
substrate. AuNPs were used as a model system because of the possibilities
to exploit the nanoplasmonic properties of the nanoparticles to investigate
the formation of the dynamic surface bound complex. To immobilize
the peptide to AuNPs, a second peptide (JR2EC), that is identical
to JR2E in all regards except that it contains a cysteine residue
in the loop region was synthesized. The JR2EC-functionalized particles
(JR2EC-AuNPs) have an exceptional colloidal stability both because
of the high negative net charge of the peptide resulting in electrostatic
repulsion between particles according to the DLVO theory34 and the steric stabilization afforded by the
peptide coating. The colloidal stability can be tuned by pH or addition
of metal cations, as reported previously.29,30 Reversible nanoparticle self-assembly can thus be triggered as a
result of folding and homodimerization between peptides situated on
neighboring AuNPs.

By exposing the peptide-functionalized AuNPs
to p-HTMI, the immobilized peptide can be used as a scaffold for anchoring
the LCO to the particle surface in a chemically and structurally defined
fashion. Because the association of the LCO to the immobilized peptide
will affect both the peptide net charge and the folding of the peptide
and promote homodimerization, the colloidal stability will be affected
(Figure 5A). The interaction
can thus be monitored by assessing changes in the LSPR response from
the particles. Before investigating the effect of p-HTMI on JR2EC-AuNPs,
we concluded that no overlap in the extinction spectrum of the LSPR
band deriving from the AuNPs and the extinction from the LCO occurred
(Figure S6). When exposing JR2EC-AuNPs
to p-HTMI (3 μM), particle aggregation occurred and the LSPR
peak maximum (λmax) was massively red shifted from
524 to 590 nm, reaching a saturation after 20 min (Figure 5B). The large red shift occurs
due to plasmon coupling as the particle plasmons start to overlap
when the interparticle distance is decreased.35 The shift in λmax (Δλmax) induced by the LCO was highly dependent on the p-HTMI concentration
(Figure 5C), where
concentrations of LCO above 2 μM caused a rapid aggregation
of the JR2EC-AuNPs. By plotting the Δλmax for
the different concentrations of LCO after reaching saturation (20
min), a clear dose responsive curve for the LCO-induced aggregation
was found within a narrow concentration span of 1.75–4 μM
p-HTMI (Figure 5D).
Fitting the data to a monophasic hill equation, the concentration
of LCO required for producing a 50% LSPR response (Δλ50%) could be calculated to be 2.5 μM. This value correlates
well with the calculated Kd for the complex
formation derived from extinction data (7.3 μM). Thus, the peptide–LCO
complex could also be afforded when the peptide was attached to a
solid support. Furthermore, transmission electron micrographs of JR2EC-AuNPs
treated with p-HTMI showed large aggregates of particles with a distinct
spacing between individual particles (Figure 5E), which is to be expected as the peptide–LCO
complexes formed in between the AuNPs have a low electron density
and will thus not be visible in the TEM.

formation of JR2EC–p-HTMI on the particle surface used in (B–E).

LSPR peak shifts after 20 min as a function of p-HTMI concentration.

Peptide–LCO Complex Formation on Immobilized AuNPs
To further study the peptide–LCO complex formation on a
particle surface using LSPR but without affecting the colloidal stability
of the AuNPs, thus avoiding plasmon coupling and homodimerization
of the peptide, the AuNPs were immobilized on a substrate (Figure 6A). The negatively
charged AuNPs were electrostatically immobilized using a layer-by-layer
assembly of polyelectrolytes with a positively charged polymer as
the top layer directly in a microwell plate.36 The AuNPs were subsequently functionalized with JR2EC, and the interaction
with p-HTMI was probed using the LSPR shifts that solely depend on
interactions occurring at the solution–particle interface.
In static (nonflow) LSPR measurements with increasing concentrations
of p-HTMI, a dose-dependent shift in the LSPR peak position could
be detected (Figure S7). Washing the immobilized
JR2EC-AuNPs with buffer did not alter the LSPR response, confirming
the firm attachment of the LCO. We further investigated if the emission
from the attached LCO could be detected. Prior to washing the wells
with immobilized JR2EC-AuNPs with buffer, a decreased emission from
p-HTMI could be detected as the complex formation occurred at the
particle–solvent interface (Figure S8), which reduced the concentration of free LCO in the buffer. This
is consistent with the observation that the JR2E–p-HTMI complex
formation resulted in the decreased emission intensity (Figure 2B). It is also plausible that
the decrease was not due to AuNP-coupled quenching as saturation could
be observed for high concentrations of LCO which can be attributed
to complexation to all available peptides. The emission after rinsing
off unbound LCO could also be detected (Figure 6B), despite the low surface LCO concentration
which is due to the immobilization of JR2EC-AuNPs on to a planar 2D
substrate with a particle surface coverage of approximately 10%. A
clear correlation between emission and LCO concentration could be
seen when plotting the emission at 500 nm as a function of the LCO
concentration (Figure 6C). We further evaluated if the kinetics of the association of p-HTMI
to JR2EC could be studied using the same LSPR-based setup but coupled
to a flow system. AuNP immobilization was performed on glass cover
slips modified by the layer-by-layer assembly of polyelectrolytes,
and the AuNPs were subsequently functionalized with JR2EC as described
previously.37 LSPR measurements in a 100
μL/min flow with different concentrations of p-HTMI resulted
in real-time sensorgrams for the interaction (Figure 6D). By plotting the LSPR response at the
end of the injection (750 s) and fitting the data to a steady-state
affinity model, a dissociation constant for the interaction was calculated
to be 18.9 μM (Figure 6E). The dissociation constant for the association of p-HTMI
to immobilized JR2EC formation was thus about a 2 factor higher than
that for the association in solution, which is surprisingly similar
considering the constrains associated with a surface bound complexation
process.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have shown that a hybrid material with distinct
chiro-optical properties and architectural arrangement could be generated
via self-assembly of an anionic peptide and a cationic chemical-defined
pentameric thiophene. Self-assembly of the hybrid material induces
structural changes in the peptide, from random coil to a distinct
helical conformation, and induces optical activity in the π–π*
transition region for the pentameric thiophene. Thus, the hybrid material
exhibits unique structural and chiro-optical properties that are afforded
because of the self-assembly of the peptide and the optoelectronic
element. Additionally, both the individual constituents and the final
hybrid material display excellent solubility in an aqueous environment
without the formation of large aggregates which is promising for further
development of highly defined optoelectronic structures and devices.
Theoretical calculations confirm the experimentally observed induced
structural changes in the peptide component, as well as the electrostatic
and hydrophobic interactions contributing to the overall stability
of the complex. The peptide–LCO complex formation could also
be afforded on a solid support showing the plausibility of using a
peptide as a scaffold to orientate and self-assemble optoelectronic
functionality to the surface of a substrate. Gold nanoparticles were
used as a model system to enable LSPR-based monitoring of the self-assembly
process using both immobilized and dispersed nanoparticles. Equilibrium
was reached within minutes, and the slow dissociation indicates formation
of robust complexes. Because of the large number of possible strategies
to immobilize peptides on solid substrates,38 including the possibility to use various metal and oxide binding
peptide sequences,17−22 this assembly strategy is not only limited to gold but also opens
up for use of other and potentially more relevant substrates. This
straightforward approach for generating well-defined molecular structures
on a solid support that can be used as molecular optoelectronic antennas
allows for intriguing opportunities to further develop biocompatible
optoelectronic devices, biosensors, and strategies for energy harvesting
and artificial enzymes.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
peptides JR2E (H2N-NAADLEKAIEALEKHLEAKGPVDAAQLEKQLEQAFEAFERAG-COOH)
and JR2EC (H2N-NAADLEKAIEALEKHLEAKGPCDAAQLEKQLEQAFEAFERAG-COOH)
were synthesized as described
previously.29 The tosylate (TsO–) salt of p-HTMI was synthesized as described earlier.12

All measurements were performed in bis–tris
buffer (30 mM, pH 7.0) expect CD measurements which were performed
in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.0).

AuNPs for Solution-Based
Assays
The polypeptide-functionalized
gold nanoparticles with an average diameter of 20 nm (Cline Scientific
AB, Sweden) were prepared by an addition of 15 μL of a 1 mM
JR2EC solution (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6) to 1.485 mL of the gold
colloidal solution. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C
and then repeatedly centrifuged in order to remove the excess unbound
peptides and exchange the buffer with fresh bis–tris buffer
(30 mM, pH 7.0), until the concentration of free JR2EC was negligible
(less than 5 pM). The final concentration of JR2EC-AuNPs was estimated
to be 7.7 nM using the absorbance at 525 nm and an extinction coefficient
of 1.57 × 109 M–1 cm–1.39

Optical Characterization
The extinction and emission
spectra were collected using a Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro microplate
reader from Tecan Männedorf (Switzerland). The concentration
of p-HTMI was set to 30 μM, and the concentration of JR2E was
varied between 0 and 100 μM. Samples were incubated for 10 min
before measurements. Adsorption spectra were collected in the range
350–600 nm and background subtracted. Emission spectra were
collected in the range 450–750 nm with an excitation wavelength
of 380 nm.

CD Spectroscopy
CD measurements
were performed on a
Chirascan spectropolarimeter from Applied Photophysics (UK). CD measurements
in the near UV region were performed in a 0.1 mm cuvette between 195
and 260 nm at room temperature. The concentration of JR2E was fixed
at 30 μM, and the concentration p-HTMI was varied between 0
and 90 μM. To provide a reference spectrum for the maximum amount
of peptide folding, JR2E (30 μM) was treated with 50% TFE in
ddH2O and incubated for 10 min prior to measurement. Measurements
in the visible region were performed in a 1 mm cuvette between 300
and 600 nm at room temperature. The concentration of p-HTMI was fixed
at 30 μM, and the concentration JR2E was varied between 0 and
60 μM. Samples were incubated for 10 min before measurements,
and each spectrum was collected as an average of three scans and background
subtracted.

Dynamic Light Scattering
DLS measurements
of JR2E and
p-HTMI separate and in combination were performed on an ALV/DLS/SLS-5022F
system from ALV GmbH (Germany) using a HeNe laser at 632.8 nm. JR2E
(0–60 μM) and buffers were filtered using a polyvinylidene
fluoride filter prior to the addition of p-HTMI (0–60 μM).
Samples were incubated for 10 min and tempered to 22 °C and all
measurements were repeated 10 times and the collected data were averaged.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation
The structure of the
42 reside helix–loop–helix polypeptide JR2E was prepared
using the four-helix bundle protein (PDB code: 1MFT)40 utilizing Discovery Studio software41 in which the four-helix bundle was cut to one helix loop
helix and the amino acids of JR2E replaced the amino acids of PDB.

The structure of LCO, both cation, p-HTMI, and anion, OTs (4-methylbenzenesulfonate),
was drawn in Gauss view and optimized with the B3LYP method and 6-31G*
basis set using the program Gaussian 09,42 and the atomic charges were calculated by fitting the molecular
electrostatic potential of the electronic density using the CHELPG
procedure,43 then using PRODRG server to
generate topology files for the LCO.44

The simulations were carried out using GROMACS package 5.1.2.45 The GROMOS 96 43a1 force field and the simple
point charge model of water were employed.46 All simulations were performed in a cubic simulation box with the
dimensions of 7 × 7 × 7 nm3. The energy of each
system was minimized using the steepest descent algorithm. The simulations
were done in canonical ensemble NVT at a temperature
of 300 K using a v-rescale thermostat,47 and the pressure was coupled to a Parrinello–Rahman barostat
at 1 atm.48 The simulations were carried
out by the leap-frog integration algorithm at a time step of 2 fs.
The LINCS algorithm was used to constrain bond lengths,49 and the SETTLE algorithm was applied to constrain
water bond lengths.50 Particle mesh Ewald
was used for long-range electrostatics.33 The cutoff distance of 1.0 nm was used for both electrostatic and
van der Waals interactions. In addition, in all directions, the periodic
boundary conditions were applied. Then, the simulation was performed
in 100 ns. The graphical representation of MD results was produced
using the VMD program.51

Optical Characterization
of JR2EC-AuNPs
Absorption
spectra of the JR2EC-AuNPs were measured on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer
(Japan). JR2EC-AuNPs (77 pM) were subjected to p-HTMI (0–10
μM), and the LSPR peak was monitored for 20 min.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy
TEM micrographs were
acquired using a Tecnai G2 F20 Ultra-Twin microscope from Fei (USA)
operating at 200 kV. Grids were prepared by applying one drop of p-HTMI-treated
JR2EC-AuNPs onto a carbon-coated copper grid, and excess water was
gently wiped off with filter paper, and the grid was air-dried before
analysis.

Static LSPR Detection
A transparent 96-well plate with
flat, round bottoms (Nunc, Thermo Fischer Scientific) was used as
a substrate and prepared by plasma treatment (Diener Pico, Diener
electronics, 0.8 mbar, 240 s, 200 W, 40 kHz generator, gas used: oxygen)
for cleaning and creating a negatively charged surface. After plasma
treatment, gold nanoparticles (BBI, Ø = 50 nm)
were immobilized into the wells using polyelectrolytes. Polyelectrolyte
solutions of polyethylenimine (PEI, Mw 750 000, Sigma-Aldrich), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS, Mw 75 000, Sigma-Aldrich), and polyallylamine hydrochloride
(PAH, Mw 56 000, Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared
with a concentration of 2 mg/mL in 0.5 M NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous
solutions. The polyelectrolyte solution (100 μL) was added to
each well for 10 min on the order PEI/PSS/PAH/PSS/PAH with a thorough
rinsing of ddH2O between each deposition. Finally, 100
μL of a gold nanoparticle suspension (BBI, Ø = 50 nm) was added to the wells for 4 h, followed by rinsing with
ddH2O. Prior to the LSPR measurements, the immobilized
gold nanoparticles were functionalized by adding 50 μL/well
of 10 μM JR2EC in ddH2O for 2 h followed by rinsing
with ddH2O. Data were obtained by monitoring the plasmon
peak position after incubation of 50 μL/well of different concentrations
of p-HTMI for 30 min onto the peptide-functionalized nanoparticle
substrates. All samples were prepared in three replicates.

Absorbance
scan was measured at 400–800 nm by a Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro
microplate reader. Fluorescence spectra were collected in the range
450–750 nm with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. The polyelectrolyte
layer without AuNP was used as a control and data subtracted prior
to analysis. Absorbance data were fitted (9th degree polynomial) and
analyzed for peak position with Matlab (MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox
Release 2017a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United
States).

Real-Time LSPR Detection
Real-time LSPR measurements
were performed using a custom-made setup comprising a halogen light
source (Ocean Optics HL-2000), a USB-spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics
QE65 Pro), an injection port valve (VICI Valco), a fluidic pump (Shimadzu
LC-20AD), and an in-house fabricated flow cell. Real-time tracking
of the plasmon peak position was performed using an in-house developed
LabView software. Round glass cover slips (Fisher Scientific, d = 13 mm) were used as substrates and prepared by initial
cleaning in a solution containing a 5:1:1 mixture by volume of ddH2O, 30% hydrogen peroxide (Merck KGaA), and 25% ammonia (Merck
KGaA) for 5 min at 85 °C and thoroughly rinsed with ddH2O. Gold nanoparticles were immobilized onto the substrates using
polyelectrolytes. Polyelectrolyte solutions of PEI (Mw 750 000, Sigma-Aldrich), PSS (Mw 75 000, Sigma-Aldrich), and PAH (Mw 56 000, Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared with a concentration of 2 mg/mL
in 0.5 M NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solutions. The polyelectrolyte
solution (100 μL) was added to the glass substrates for 15 min
on the order PEI/PSS/PAH/PSS/PAH with a thorough rinsing of ddH2O between each deposition. Finally, 200 μL of a gold
nanoparticle suspension (BBI, d = 50 nm) was added
to the substrates for 4 h, followed by rinsing with ddH2O. Prior to the real-time LSPR tests, the immobilized gold nanoparticles
were functionalized by adding 200 μL of 10 μM JR2EC in
water for 2 h, followed by rinsing with ddH2O. Kinetic
data were obtained by monitoring the plasmon peak position during
injection of 500 μL of different concentrations of p-HTMI over
a peptide-functionalized nanoparticle substrate with a flow rate of
100 μL/min. Data were evaluated using BIAevaluation software.
