A series of ruthenium complexes,
namely, [{1-(N-R1-2-acetamido)-3-(R2)-benzimidazol-2-ylidine}Ru(p-cymene)Cl]Cl,
where {R1 = 2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3, R2 = i-Pr (1c); R1 = 2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3, R2 = Et (2c);
R1 = 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2, R2 = Et (3c)}, of benzimidazole-derived
N/O-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbene ligands successfully carried
out the cyanosilylation reaction of aromatic aldehydes and heteroaryl
aldehydes with trimethylsilyl cyanide, providing good to excellent
yields (ca. 60–95%) at room temperature under solvent-free
condition. The ruthenium (1–3)c complexes were synthesized from the silver (1–3)b analogues in ca. 67–80%
yields. The silver (1–3)b complexes exhibited an argentophilic d10···d10 interaction in
its dinuclear macrometallacyclic motif, as observed by a short Ag···Ag
contact of 3.1894(3) Å in single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies
for a representative silver complex 2b and also in photoluminescence
studies that showed characteristic emission band(s) at ca. 534–536
nm in the CHCl3 solution and at ca. 482–487 and
530–533 nm in the solid state.

Introduction
The cyanosilylation
reaction is an important C–C bond-forming
reaction that provides access to a variety of fine and specialty chemicals,
including a wide range of polyfuctionalized building blocks like α-hydroxy
acids, β-amino alcohols, and also the biologically active compounds.1 The reaction proceeds with the protection of
a resulting alcohol functional moiety through O-silylated cyanohydrin
(O-TMS) formation that allows further transformation
to other functionalities. The reaction is valued for its convenient
atom-economic approach and has been studied extensively in the areas
of heterogeneous catalysis;2−4 homogeneous catalysis,5−11 including ligand-assisted catalysis;12,13 organocatalysis;14−16 and those by simple metal salts.17,18 In this regard,
it is worth noting that despite the fact that the transition-metal
N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been exceptionally successful
in homogeneous catalysis,19−22 their applications in the catalysis of cyanosilylation
reaction surprisingly remains unexplored to date and hence we became
interested in pursuing the same.

With our interest in expanding
the domains
of the transition-metal N-heterocyclic carbene complexes in biomedical
applications23−25 and in chemical catalysis,26−29 spanning over the polymerization
reactions30−33 to a variety of C–C34−39 and C–N40−42 bond-forming reactions, bifunctional catalysis26,43−46 to the transfer hydrogenation reactions47 and tandem reactions,48 and asymmetric
catalysis,44,47 we became interested in exploring
the potential of the ruthenium N-heterocyclic carbene complexes in
the cyanosilylation reaction. In particular, we set out to employ
the ruthenium complexes of the benzimidazole-derived N/O-functionalized
N-heterocyclic carbene ligands for the cyanosilylation reaction of
the aromatic aldehydes.

Herein, in this manuscript, we report
a series of ruthenium complexes,
[{1-(N-R1-2-acetamido)-3-(R2)-benzimidazol-2-ylidine}Ru(p-cymene)Cl]Cl, where
{R1 = 2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3, R2 = i-Pr (1c); R1 = 2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3, R2 = Et (2c); R1 = 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2,
R2 = Et (3c)} (Figure 1) of the benzimidazole-derived N-heterocyclic
carbene ligands that performed the cyanosilylation reaction of the
aromatic aldehydes at room temperature under solvent-free conditions.
The ruthenium (1–3)c complexes were prepared by following a transmetallation route from
the silver (1–3)b analogues
(Scheme 1).

Results and Discussion
Benzimidazole-derived N-heterocyclic ligands,
namely, 1-(N-R1-2-acetamido)-3-(R2)-benzimidazol-2-ylidene {R1 = 2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3, R2 = i-Pr (1a); R1 = 2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3, R2 = Et (2a); R1 = 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2, R2 = Et (3a)}, were
constructed by incorporation of N/O-functionalized side arms on the
benzimidazole fragments. Specifically, the reaction of 2-chloro-N-R1-acetamide [R1 = 2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3, 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2] with N-1-R2-benzimidazole (R2 = i-Pr, Et) gave 1-(N-R1-2-acetamido)-3-(R2)-benzimidazolium chloride salts {R1 = 2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3, R2 = i-Pr (1a); R1 = 2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3, R2 = Et (2a); R1 = 2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2, R2 = Et (3a)} in ca. 71–79% yields. Subsequently, the reaction of the
benzimidazolium chloride salts (1–3)a with Ag2O in CH2Cl2 under the exclusion of light at ambient temperature resulted in
the formation of corresponding Ag–NHC complexes (1–3)b in ca. 88–95% yields.
Quite expectedly, the characteristic Ag–Ccarbene resonances of the silver complexes (1–3)b appeared highly downfield shift at ca. δ
183.3–189.1 ppm in the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum.

The molecular structure of a representative 2b complex
(Table 2 and Figure 2) has been determined
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies that confirmed the dimeric
macrometallacyclic nature of the silver complex of the type {1-(N-R2-2-acetamido)-3-(R1)-benzimidazol-2-ylidine}2Ag2 [R1 = Et; R2 = 2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3], similar to
that observed earlier for the related silver analogues.49−51 The geometry around each of the two silver atoms was nearly linear
[∠C(1)–Ag(1)–N(3)i = 168.61(8)°]
with the metal atom bound to amido–N at one
end and to Ccarbene atom at the other end. The Ag–Ccarbene bond distance of 2.073(2) Å was slightly shorter
than the sum of the individual covalent radii of C and Ag (2.18 Å)52 but compared well to that of the related analogues,
namely, 1-(R3)-3-{N-(2,6-di-i-propylphenylacetamido)-imidazol-2-ylidine}2Ag2 {R3 = i-Pr [2.066(8) Å], t-Bu [2.032(4) Å]}.49 Similarly,
the Ag–Namido distance of 2.0898(18) Å too
was observed to be shorter than the sum of the individual covalent
radii of N and Ag (2.16 Å)52 and also
comparable to that of the related complexes, 1-(R3)-3-{N-(2,6-di-i-propylphenylacetamido)-imidazol-2-ylidine}2Ag2 {R3 = i-Pr [2.084(6)
Å], t-Bu [2.073(3) Å]}.49

Of particular interest is the
Ag···Ag distance of
3.1894(3) Å in 2b, which is significantly shorter
than twice the van der Waals radius of Ag (1.72 Å),53 suggesting the presence of argentophilic d10···d10 interaction. Further corroboration came from the photoluminescence
studies performed on all of the silver (1–3)b complexes in both the CHCl3 solution
and the solid state at room temperature. Specifically, upon excitation
at 270 nm, the silver (1–3)b complexes showed characteristic low-energy emissions at
ca. 534–536 nm in the CHCl3 solution and at ca.
482–487 and 530–533 nm in the solid state assignable
to the argentophilic d10···d10 interaction (Table 1, Figures 3, 4, and S1–S4 in the Supporting Information). Finally, ligand-based
emissions appeared at high energy and ca. 302–386 nm for the
silver (1–3)b complexes.

The Ag···Ag distance of 3.1894(3) Å and the
corresponding emissions at 534 nm in CHCl3 and at 486 and
530 nm in the solid state at room temperature for the structurally
characterized representative silver complex 2b compare
well with the related structurally characterized dinuclear silver
complexes, namely, 1-(R3)-3-{N-(2,6-di-i-propylphenylacetamido)-imidazol-2-ylidine}2Ag2 [R3 = i-Pr (emission at
647 nm in CHCl3 and 635 nm in solid state at room temperature
for a Ag···Ag distance of 3.550 Å), t-Bu (emission at 630 nm in CHCl3 and 632 nm in solid state
at room temperature for a Ag···Ag distance of 3.771
Å)], and other related complexes.49,54

Finally,
the ruthenium complexes (1–3)c were obtained from silver complexes (1–3)b in ca. 67–80% yields
by reaction with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 at room temperature. The 1H NMR spectra of the
(1–3)c complexes showed
the amido–NH resonance
at δ ca. 12.18–12.50 ppm, whereas the 13C{1H} NMR spectra showed the characteristic Ru–Ccarbene resonance at δ ca. 187.6–189.1 ppm. Unlike the case
of the benzimidazolium chloride salts (1–3)a and the silver (1–3)b complexes, for which the methylene (CH2) resonances appeared
as singlets at δ 5.96–6.05 and 5.28–5.36 ppm,
respectively, the same for the ruthenium (1–3)c complexes appeared as diastereotopic doublets
at δ 5.31 and 5.32 ppm (1c), δ 5.40 and 5.41
ppm (2c), and δ 5.18 and 5.02 ppm (3c), exhibiting two-bond (2JH–H) geminal coupling constants of 14–15 Hz in the 1H NMR spectra. The IR spectra of the (1–3)c complexes showed the amido–CO stretching
frequency at ca. 1624–1627 cm–1, which is
significantly at a lower energy with regard to the amido–CO
stretching frequency of the free ligands, 1a (1679 cm–1), 2a (1679 cm–1),
and 3a (1690 cm–1), and has been ascribed
to the coordination of amido–O atom to the
ruthenium center in the (1–3)c complexes, as observed earlier.55

The molecular structures of all of the three (1–3)c complexes (Table 2 and Figures 5–7) have been determined
by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction studies, which showed these complexes exhibiting
a conventional “piano stool” structure with the ruthenium
center being bound to η6-p-cymene,
η2-amido-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbene ligand
and chloride atoms. The Ru–Ccarbene bond distances
in 1c [2.0556(15) Å], 2c [2.038(3)
Å], and 3c [2.0410(18) Å] were slightly shorter
than the sum of individual covalent radii of Ru and C atoms (2.19
Å)52 but compared well with other
reported analogues, namely, [{1-(N-benzylacetamido)-3-(R4)-imidazol-2-ylidene}Ru(p-cymene)Cl]Cl {R4 = Me [2.0172(19) Å], i-Pr [2.033(5)
Å], and CH2Ph [2.019(3) Å]}56 and [{1-(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-yl)-3-(mesityl)-imidazol-2-ylidene}Ru(p-cymene)Cl]PF6 [2.038(3) Å].57 Likewise, the Ru–Cl bond distances in 1c [2.4041(4) Å], 2c [2.3907(8) Å],
and 3c [2.4005(5) Å] were in agreement with the
related complexes [{1-(N-benzylacetamido)-3-(R4)-imidazol-2-ylidene}Ru(p-cymene)Cl]Cl {R4 = Me [2.4256(14) Å], i-Pr [2.4325(8)
Å], and CH2Ph [2.4404(7) Å]},56 [{1-(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-yl)-3-(mesityl)-imidazol-2-ylidene}Ru(p-cymene)Cl]PF6 [2.420(1) Å],57 and the Ru–Oamido bond distances
in 1c [2.1563(11) Å], 2c [2.148(2)
Å], and 3c [2.1276(13) Å] with a related complex
[{1-(N-benzylacetamido)-3-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-imidazol-2-ylidene}Ru(CH3CN)2(PPh3)](PF6)2 [2.143(4) Å].55

Quite significantly,
the ruthenium (1–3)c complexes carried out the cyanosilylation
of aryl aldehydes (eq 1) and heteroaryl aldehydes (eq 2) at room temperature under solvent-free conditions (Tables 3 and 4). Specifically, catalyst optimization studies conducted on
a representative pair of substrates, namely, benzaldehyde and trimethylsilyl
cyanide (TMSCN), showed a maximum yield of 87% for the 1c complex after 6 h of reaction time at 2 mol % of catalyst loading.
The control experiment, when performed with [Ru(p-cymene)Cl]2 at the identical 2 mol % of the ruthenium
loading, produced the corresponding product 2-phenyl-2-(trimethylsilyloxy)acetonitrile
(4) in 30% yield under analogous reaction conditions
and thereby upheld the amplification observed in the product yields
(ca. 77–87%) in case of the (1–3)c complexes. The Hg drop experiment performed for the
(1–3)c complexes showed
nearly equal yields both in the presence and absence of Hg, thus indicating
the homogeneous nature of catalysis. Substrate scope studies were
subsequently performed for the ruthenium (1–3)c complexes for a variety of aryl aldehydes
and heteroaryl aldehydes, namely, picolinaldehyde, furfural, and thiophene-2-aldehyde
substrates, which gave good to excellent product yields. Interestingly,
the 1c complex, containing sterically demanding i-Pr group, gave better yields than the other two catalysts 2c and 3c.

It is important
to compare the catalytic activity of the ruthenium
(1–3)c complexes with
the others reported in the literature. In the absence of any report
on the use of a ruthenium N-heterocyclic complex in the cyanosilylation
reaction, the comparison is thus made with the structurally characterized
examples of the transition-metal complexes of other ligands (Table 5). For example, for
the cyanosilylation of benzaldehyde with TMSCN, a ruthenium complex,
namely, [Ru(phgly)2(binap)]/Li2CO3 (phgly = phenylglycinate, binap = 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphanyl)-1,1′-binaphthyl),8 exhibited 98% of the product yield at −78
°C after 12 h of reaction time at 0.01 mol % of catalyst loading.
Likewise, at the same 0.01 mol % of the catalyst loading, another
ruthenium complex, [Ru{(S)-phgly}2{(S)-biphep}]/Li2CO3 [biphep = 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)biphenyl],6 too gave a product yield of 99% at −78
°C after 6 h of reaction time. Both of these ruthenium complexes
thus exhibited superior activities to our ruthenium (1–3)c complexes that exhibited ca.
77–87% yields at room temperature after 6 h of reaction time
at a higher 2 mol % of catalyst loadings. However, a vanadyl salen
complex7 displayed 94% of the product yield
at −20 °C after 24 h of reaction time at a 5 mol % of
catalyst loading. Another iron complex, [(Cp)2Fe]PF6,9 showed 94% of product yield
at room temperature after 10 h of reaction time at a 2.5 mol % of
catalyst loading under solvent-free condition. General

Conclusions
In summary, a series of three new N/O-functionalized
benzimidazole-2-ylidene-based
cationic ruthenium (1–3)c complexes have been synthesized by employing the transmetallation
route from their corresponding silver (1–3)b complexes in good yields. The silver (1–3)b complexes exhibited
argentophilic d10···d10 interaction as observed by the emission band(s)
at ca. 534–536 nm in the CHCl3 solution and at ca.
482–487 and 530–533 nm in the solid state and also from
the structural characterization of a representative silver complex 2b, which showed a short Ag···Ag contact of
3.1894(3) Å in its dimeric macrometallacyclic structure. Structural
characterization of the ruthenium (1–3)c complexes revealed the chelation of the N-heterocyclic
carbene ligand to the metal center through an Oamido sidearm
moiety and a carbene moiety. Significantly enough, the ruthenium (1–3)c complexes efficiently
carried out the cyanosilylation of various aryl aldehydes and heteroaryl
aldehydes at room temperature under solvent-free condition in good
to excellent yields. Out of the three complexes, the ruthenium 1c complex, containing sterically demanding i-Pr group, exhibited superior activity.

Procedures
All of the experiments were performed
using a glovebox and Schlenk techniques. Solvents were purified and
degassed by standard procedures. 1-i-Propylbenzimidazole,58 1-ethyllbenzimidazole,58 2-chloro-N-mesitylacetamide,59 [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2,60 and 2-chloro-N-(2,6-di-i-propylphenyl)acetamide59 were
synthesized according to the procedures reported in the literature. 1H NMR spectra and 13C{1H} NMR spectra
were recorded on Bruker 400 and 500 MHz NMR spectrometers, respectively.
The multiplicities of the 1H NMR peaks are assigned as
singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q) broad (br), triplet
of triplets (tt), doublet of doublets (dd), multiplet (m), and septet
(sept). A PerkinElmer Spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer was used for
recording IR spectra. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using
Micromass Q-Tof and a Bruker Maxis Impact spectrometer. Elemental
analysis data were obtained from the Elemental Analyzer Thermo Quest
FLASH 1112 SERIES. The electronic spectra of compounds 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3a, 3b were recorded in CH3Cl using a Varian
Cary UV 100 spectrophotometer. Emission spectra of compounds 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3a, 3b were recorded in both CH3Cl
solution and solid state using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of compounds (1–3)c and 2b was conducted
on a Rigaku Hg 724+ diffractometer, and crystal data collection and
refinement parameters are summarized in Table 2. The structures were solved using direct
methods and standard difference map techniques and were refined by
full-matrix least-squares procedures on F2 with SHELXTL (version 6.10).61,62 For the catalysis runs,
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analyses
were done using Agilent Technologies 7890A GC systems with 5975C inert
XL EI/CI MSD Triple-Axis detector and the chiral GC resolutions were
done using Agilent Technologies 7890A GC systems with CP-Chirasil-Dex
CB chiral column.

General Procedure of Photoluminescence Studies
Using
a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer, emission spectra of compounds 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3a, 3b were recorded in CH3Cl solution
(0.001 M) at 25 °C upon excitation at 270 nm in quartz cuvettes.
The solid-state experiment was performed for the respective compounds 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3a, 3b by mixing with NaCl in the ratio of 1:100
and then grinding the mixture to a powder before recording the emission
spectra at 25 °C upon excitation at 270 nm in quartz glass slab.

General Procedure for Cyanosilylation of Aldehydes Using Ruthenium
(1–3)c Complexes
Ruthenium (1–3)c complexes (0.02
mmol, 2 mol %), aryl aldehyde substrate (1.00 mmol), and TMSCN (3
mmol) were mixed, and the resultant solution was stirred for 6 h at
room temperature. All volatiles were then removed in vacuo, and the
crude product was purified by column chromatography using neutral
Al2O3 as a stationary phase and eluting with
petroleum ether/EtOAc (99:1–70:30 v/v) to give the cyanosilylated
product (4–13).
