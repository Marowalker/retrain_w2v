Reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-coated
TiO2 microcones
have been synthesized via simple anodization and cyclic voltammetry
for use in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Microcones had a perpendicularly
oriented hollow core, an anatase structure, and a high surface area,
allowing higher capacity than other nanosized TiO2 structures.
TiO2 has low electrical conductivity, leading to the limitation
of fast charging and high capacity; however, this was improved by
the application of an RGO coating in this work. As anode materials
of LIB, the obtained RGO microcone showed a capacity of 157 mAh g–1 at 10C (fully charged within ∼360 s) and sustained
1000 cycles with only 0.02% capacity fading per cycle. The capacity
was 1.5 times higher than that of conventional microcone. We speculated
that the decrease in the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) played a crucial role in increasing the capacity with
fast charging.

Introduction
With the increased
use of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in numerous
applications,1−3 the need for improvement in safety, cycle life, capacity,
and fast charging performance is also increasing significantly.4−8 Conventional graphite anodes for LIB still pose the risk of dendrite
formation through decomposition of the electrolyte during fast charging.
TiO2 is one of the most attractive alternative materials
owing to its appropriate operating potential window (∼1.7 vs
Li/Li+) and lack of electrolyte decomposition.9−11 The morphology or phase of TiO2 greatly influences the
electrochemical properties, such as capacity, cyclability, performance,
and conductivity.12,13 For example, TiO2 microcones,
which have a hollow core with a multilayered anatase structure, can
be produced via facile one-step anodization and show 3 times higher
capacity than TiO2 nanotubes.7 However, although microcones show higher capacity and excellent
cycle performance, they cannot overcome the low theoretical capacity
and conductivity of TiO2 itself.

In this study, graphene
oxide (GO), which shows both high energy
density and excellent conductivity, was applied as a coating layer
to increase the capacity and electrical conductivity of microcone.14−16 Since the oxygen functional groups of GO, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl,
and carbonyl, interfere with ionic conductivity, reduced graphene
oxide (RGO) microcone should be prepared for the battery anode.17−19 We found that conventional reduction methods of GO on TiO2 microcone, such as hydrothermal reduction,20−22 cathodic reduction,23,24 and annealing under Ar (or +H2) gas,25,26 were not very effective since TiO2 microcone provided
abundant oxygen with GO during the reduction process. In addition,
the optimized 1 cycle cyclic voltammetry (CV) was the most efficient
way to produce RGO microcone from oxygen-abundant environment.27 The prepared RGO microcone as an anode material
for LIB showed a specific capacity of 157 mAh g–1 at 10C, which corresponds to 1.5 times higher capacity compared
to that of the previous TiO2 microcone. In addition, the
battery performance retained its capacity over 1000 cycles with only
0.02% capacity fading per cycle, meaning that we can greatly improve
the LIB anode of TiO2 microcone by a facile CV reduction
process.

Results and Discussion
After electrophoretic deposition
of GO on TiO2 microcone,
it was reduced to RGO by various conventional methods: hydrothermal
reduction, cathodic reduction, annealing in H2 + Ar, annealing
in Ar, and electrochemical CV method. Because of oxygen-abundant environmental
surface of TiO2, GO was not very effectively reduced to
RGO. For example, in the case of hydrothermal route, hazardous hydrazine
hydrate was used to reduce GO on TiO2 microcone in an autoclave
at 95 °C for 12 h. Due to high pressure and temperature, resultant
RGOs were aggregated together (see the arrow in Figure S1a). On the other hand, cathodic reduction in 0.1
M Na2SO4 at −1 V for 1 min led to locally
detach microcone from the Ti substrate (see the arrow in Figure S1b), meaning that the microcone was not
stably adhered on the substrate during the cathodic reduction of GO.
Annealing processes in H2 + Ar and Ar were conducted at
550 °C for 1 h and 200 °C for 2 h, respectively, to reduce
GO on the microcone. Although the annealing processes showed a better
reduction result over the entire surface compared to the other reduction
methods, some microcones had spilt ends during the annealing in H2 + Ar (see the arrow Figure S1c) and the head of the microcone was collapsed during the annealing
in Ar (see the arrow Figure S1d). We found
that RGO-coated microcone was successfully prepared via electrochemical
CV reduction (Figure 1a); microcones with a diameter of approximately 3.37–6.73
μm and a height of 4.31–9.57 μm were produced on
the Ti substrate, perpendicular to the substrate face. The microcones
maintained their original morphology, with no indication of collapse
or detachment from the Ti substrate after the electrophoretic deposition
and CV processes. Notice that a range of CV reduction was a very important
factor to effectively reduce GO to RGO (Figure S2). When the potential range was extended up to −1.2
V (green line) or −1.5 V (violet line), an anodic peak appeared
in the backward scan, indicating that the reduced GO was oxidized
to GO again during the backward scan. Therefore, a potential range
of −1.0–0.8 V was selected as an appropriate potential
range, showing no anodic current peak. Furthermore, to find out the
most optimum ratio between RGO and TiO2 microcone, CV reduction
was conducted in the potential range of 0.8 to −1.0 V (Figure S3), which indicated that only the first
cycle did not exhibit anodic current peak. This means that RGO was
coated thinly and evenly on the surface of TiO2 microcone
without the loss of large active surface area. Therefore, the weight
was not significantly changed during CV reduction due to a very tiny
amount of RGO.

Figure 1 (a) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and (b) High resolution-transmission
electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images of the as-prepared RGO microcone
by CV reduction and (c) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of microcone
and RGO microcone.

Figure 1b shows
an high-resolution (HR)-TEM image of the as-prepared RGO microcone,
clearly confirming the presence of RGO nanosheets. The dark part represents
the RGO nanosheets on the microcone, which enhanced the intrinsically
poor electrical conductivity of the TiO2. Figure 1c shows XRD patterns of pristine
microcone and RGO microcone. The detected peaks for the microcone
correspond to the diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2 (anatase
TiO2 relating to (101), (004), (200), and (105), (JCPDS
no. 01-71-1166)) and Ti peaks from the Ti substrate. The same peaks
were observed for RGO microcone, demonstrating that the microcones
maintained their original crystallinity after modification with RGO.
Although the presence of RGO was confirmed via the HR-TEM images (Figure 1b), the peak for
RGO at approximately 2θ = 24.5° was not observed in the
XRD spectrum of RGO microcone, which could be attributed to the overlap
with the peak relating to the anatase phase (101) and a small loading
of RGO.

Raman spectroscopy was used to identify the presence
of RGO, confirming
the reduction of GO to RGO (Figure 2 and Table 1). Two major peaks were detected: the D band is related to
local defects and disorders in graphitic carbonaceous materials, and
the G band is related to sp2 hybridized carbon. The intensity
ratio ID/IG is used as a parameter for measuring oxidation/reduction processes.17,19,28,29 Since more structural defects are formed after the reduction process
of GO, an increase in the intensity ratio of ID/IG indicates the reduction of
GO to RGO. Therefore, by comparison of the ID/IG of the pristine GO and RGO
reduced by the CV reduction, which were 0.94 and 1.24, respectively,
the reduction of GO to RGO by CV reduction was the best method among
all routes that we tested. Since RGO has excellent electrical conductivity,
we expected that it could efficiently transfer electrons to the microcone,
resulting in an improvement in cell performance for LIB.

In Figure 3, the
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the GO microcone
and the RGO microcone provide evidence for the reduction of GO to
RGO in terms of chemical states. The C 1s spectrum shows C=C/C–C
peaks at 285.15 and 285.36 eV, C–O peaks at 287.10 eV, and
C=O peaks at 288.70 eV.30 In comparison
to the spectrum of GO microcone, the decreased binding energy intensities
between carbon and oxygen, especially for C–O, in the spectrum
of RGO microcone indicate reduction of the oxygen-containing functional
groups of GO. In the O 1s spectra, the detected peaks of Ti–O
(530.18 eV) and −OH (531.80 eV) clearly confirm the TiO2 microcone structure.28 In addition,
the other peak at 532.93 eV is related to C=O, further confirming
that the GO was reduced to RGO. Peaks for Ti 2p were observed at 458.88
and 464.58 eV, which are in accordance with the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 in TiO2, respectively,31 demonstrating that the microcone maintained
their original chemical composition after the GO reduction process.

The electrochemical performance of the RGO microcone and
microcone
electrodes was studied in a coin-type cell. Prior to the electrochemical
evaluation, the cell exhibited stable open circuit voltages at approximately
1.8 V (vs Li/Li+). CV curves of microcone and RGO microcone
were obtained in the potential range of 1.0–3.0 V (vs Li/Li+) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 at the fifth
cycle (Figure 4a).
During cathodic and anodic sweeps of both electrodes, redox peaks
at approximately 1.71 and 1.9 V (vs Li/Li+) were in accordance
with insertion and extraction of lithium ions into the anatase TiO2 phase, respectively, which can be described by the following
equation32  x can vary with the polymorph,
morphology, and crystallinity of the prepared TiO2 electrode.
Similar anodic and cathodic peaks for microcone and RGO microcone
indicated that both electrodes had excellent reversibility. Moreover,
almost no difference in the CV curves was observed during repeated
cycles, providing further evidence of the excellent reversibility
of both electrodes. Higher current densities (0.3 mA cm–2) were observed for the RGO microcone electrode compared with the
microcone electrode (0.2 mA cm–2), resulting in
higher charge/discharge capacities. Figure 4b provides the galvanostatic charge/discharge
curves for the RGO microcone and microcone between 1.0 and 3.0 V at
a current density of 125 mA g–1 for the first cycle,
showing that both voltage plateaus are well-matched with the CV curves
of Figure 4a. Microcone
and RGO microcone deliver discharge capacities of 181 and 235 mAh
g–1 with high Coulombic efficiencies of 89 and 95%,
respectively.

impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data.

Figure 4c
shows
the cycling stability of the RGO-microcone electrode at specific current
densities of 125, 250, and 625 mA g–1 until the
100th cycle. Initial capacity loss is observed generally due to the
existence of irreversible Li trapped sites and trace amounts of adsorbed
water, which is common in porous materials.6 The charge/discharge capacity of the RGO-microcone electrode decreases
with increasing specific current density and continues stably with
high Coulombic efficiency, showing excellent capacity retention under
all conditions. Evaluation of the rate capability was carried out
at rates of up to 50C (6250 mA g–1) for the microcone
and RGO-microcone electrodes (Figure 4d). Even at an ultrafast rate of 50C, the RGO microcone
could deliver a discharge capacity of 88 mAh g–1, which is significantly improved, compared with other results (note
that 100 mAh g–1@13C and 97.7 mAh g–1@16C).17,33Figure 4e shows the long-term cyclability of the RGO microcone
at a high C-rate of 10C. Discharge capacity of 157 mAh g–1 was maintained for 1000 cycles, with a capacity fading rate of only
0.019% per cycle, demonstrating excellent cycling stability of the
RGO microcone even at a high C-rate of 10C. This result can be attributed
to the structural benefits of the microcone that create a large, electrochemically
active surface area. The microcones have multilayer nanofragments
and a hollow core, leading to efficient Li+ diffusion7 in addition to the enhanced electrical conductivity
provided by the RGO coating.

Figure 4f shows
Nyquist plots of both electrodes obtained by EIS measurements before
charge/discharge cycles, which shows the comparison of the electrical
conductivity of the microcone and RGO-microcone electrodes. An equivalent
circuit in the inset was depicted to fit the spectra. Re corresponds to the electrolyte resistance, CPEdl represents a constant-phase element of a double-layer capacitance,
and Warburg impedance (W) is affected by lithium-ion
diffusion in the electrode.15,33,34 The charge-transfer resistance (Rct)
was calculated as 64.65 and 25.13 Ω for microcone and RGO microcone,
respectively, clearly confirming that charge transfer is significantly
enhanced by RGO coating.

In this study, we successfully modified
microcone structures for
LIB applications by coating the microcone with RGO through various
methods. For the fabrication of RGO microcone, microcones were first
coated with GO by electrophoretic deposition; GO was then successfully
reduced to form RGO via a simple CV method, with no evidence of morphological
change or collapse of the microcone. The presence of RGO was confirmed
by XPS analysis and Raman spectroscopy. RGO-microcone electrodes exhibited
significantly higher electrochemical performance than that of microcone
electrodes. The specific capacity of RGO microcone was around 1.5
times higher than that of microcone, showing the excellent capacity
retention. We speculate that these results were caused by a sharp
drop in the charge-transfer resistance induced by the highly conductive
RGO.

Experimental Section
Preparation of RGO–TiO2 Microcones
Before anodization, titanium foil (0.127 mm
thick, 99.7% purity,
Sigma-Aldrich) was ultrasonicated sequentially in acetone, ethanol,
and deionized (DI) water and then dried at room temperature. H3PO4 (1 M, Sigma-Aldrich) and hydrofluoric acid
(0.5 vol %, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in DI water for the electrolytes.
The anodization was carried out at 60 V for 45 min using a direct
current (DC) power supply (N8761A, Agilent Technologies). A homemade,
two-electrode Teflon cell with titanium foil as the working electrode
and platinum mesh as the counter electrode was used for the anodization
process.

For the deposition of GO on the microcone, 25 mg of
single-layer GO (ACS Material, LLC) was dispersed in 100 mL of DI
water via ultrasonication and cooled to room temperature. The electrophoretic
deposition was carried out in the same cell used for anodization,
using a DC power supply. GO was deposited on the positively biased
microcone at 60 V for 10 min. The prepared GO-microcone specimens
were rinsed with DI water. The electrochemical reduction of GO microcone
to RGO microcone was carried out in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (Sigma-Aldrich) via 1 cycle CV reduction in the optimal potential
range of −1.0–0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl) using an electrochemical
workstation (PGSTAT302N, Autolab Metrohm) (Figure S2). The specimens were rinsed with DI water and dried overnight
at 60 °C.

Physical Characterization
A field-emission
scanning
electron microscope (FE-SEM, 4300S, Hitachi) equipped with an energy-dispersive
X-ray electron microscope and a high resolution-transmission electron
microscope (HR-TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL) were used for analysis of the
surface morphology. The chemical composition and crystallinity of
the specimens were investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku
D/max-RB) with Cu Kα radiation (1.54056 Å). X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, VGESCALAB 220i-XL spectrometer, Fiscons) analysis
using an Al Kα X-ray source was performed to gain more detailed
information about the chemical states. The carbonaceous materials
were studied further using a Raman spectrometer (Lab Ram ARAMIS, HORIBA).
The weight of specimens was accurately measured by a microbalance
(BM-22, AND). All RGO-microcone electrodes weighed on an average 0.6
mg.

Electrochemical Measurements
The electrochemical performance
of the RGO-microcone anode material for the LIB was evaluated in coin-type
cells (CR-2032; Wellcos Corporation), which were assembled in an Ar-filled
glovebox with H2O and O2 content below 1 ppm.
The RGO microcone was used as the working electrode, and Li foil was
used as the counter and reference electrode. Glass fiber (GF/A, Whatman)
was placed as a separator between the two electrodes. The electrolyte
was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl
carbonate (1:1 by volume, Sigma-Aldrich). Note that the cell did not
include binder and conducting agents as the anodic microcones were
grown directly on a Ti substrate. CV measurements were carried out
with the electrochemical workstation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements were carried out with an amplitude of 5 mV between
106 and 10–1 Hz using the electrochemical
workstation. Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling was conducted
at various C-rates using a battery cycler system (WBCS 3000; WonATech).
