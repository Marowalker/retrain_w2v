Mixed films of a
high-permittivity oxide, Er2O3, and a magnetic
material, Fe2O3, were grown
by atomic layer deposition on silicon and titanium nitride at 375
°C using erbium diketonate, ferrocene, and ozone as precursors.
Crystalline phases of erbium and iron oxides were formed. Growth into
three-dimensional trenched structures was demonstrated. A structure
deposited using tens to hundreds subsequent cycles for both constituent
metal oxide layers promoted both charge polarization and saturative
magnetization compared to those in the more homogeneously mixed films.

Introduction
Mixtures of rare earth ferrites have been
of interest due to their
attractive optical, electrical, and magnetic properties. Herewith
some hexagonal orthoferrites RFeO3, where R denotes a trivalent
rare earth cation, such as epitaxial YbFeO31 or single-crystal LuFeO3,2 have been described as materials demonstrating recordable
ferroelectric polarization. The latter ternary materials have also
been defined as multiferroic. Further, in epitaxially grown rare earth
ferrite materials, weak ferromagnetism at low temperatures has been
recorded, e.g., in the case of erbium ferrite below 120 K.3 Moreover, polarization in both external electric
and magnetic fields at room temperature has been recorded in pulsed
laser deposited hexagonally structured ErFeO3 films,4,5 revealing polarization-charge-field loops characteristic of ferroelectric
polarization, as claimed, and also narrow magnetization-field hysteresis
loops.

Physical performance of the materials layers may considerably
depend
on their synthesis routes. The materials grown epitaxially or using
precursor materials of the highest purity, such as those mentioned
above, may exhibit structural and chemical qualities relatively close
to the perfection. At the same time, thin solid films or particles
deposited on substrates not supporting commensurate growth, or synthesized
chemically in low-temperature processes exploiting precursors with
ligands, will inevitably contain large amounts of residual contaminants
and/or possess disordered polycrystalline structure. In such materials,
the achievement of well-defined physical performance and appearance
of functionality may easily occur complicated. For instance, particles
of different rare earth oxides, including ErFeO3, obtained
by sonochemical method from Fe(CO)5 and rare earth carbonate
precursors, exhibited almost insignificant magnetization hysteresis
at room temperature.6 Deteriorating effect
on the magnetic coercivity of secondary phases and concurrent reversed
domains appearing upon increase in the growth rate was demonstrated
in the case of otherwise single-crystal ErFeO3 grown by
the floating-zone method.7

Synthesis
of thin erbium ferrite films at low temperatures, possessing
defined electric and magnetic properties, is thus presumably challenging
and has been attempted scarcely. Iron erbium oxide (Er–Fe–O)
thin films have been grown earlier by atomic layer deposition (ALD)
using either a cyclopentadienyl-type precursor for erbium, carbonyl-type
precursor for iron, and ozone for oxygen8 or β-diketonates of erbium and iron, and ozone.9 The material to be magnetized has been grown
initially in the form of a double layer,8 comprising a 9 nm thick Er2O3 deposited at
200 °C, followed by the deposition of 14 nm thick FeOx at 350 °C. The stack was subsequently
annealed and recrystallized as ternary solids, e.g., ErFeO3, ErFe2O4, and Er3Fe5O12, evidently after solid-state reaction at 850 °C.
The appearance of certain ferromagnetic moment in the film at room
temperature was recorded.8 These films
were not yet characterized electrically.

In the present study,
the thin films containing iron and erbium
oxides were grown by atomic layer deposition using tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)erbium
(Er(thd)3) and Fe(C5H5)2 (FeCp2) as metal precursors, and O3 as an
oxygen precursor. The films were grown both mixtures and laminate-like
stacks of iron and erbium oxides using sequential deposition of just
a few layers for constituent oxides, or using tens of cycles for every
separate layer of erbium and iron oxides. Composition, structure,
and magnetic and electrical behavior of the films were examined.

Results
and Discussion
Film Growth, Morphology, and Structure
On planar SiO2/Si substrates, the Er2O3 and Fe2O3 reference films were grown
to the thicknesses
of 4.0 ± 0.5 and 20.9 ± 0.1 nm after 1000 growth cycles,
respectively. Thus, the average growth rates of constituent oxides
separately were 0.004 and 0.021 nm/cycle for Er2O3 and Fe2O3 films, respectively. One can note
marked differences in the film growth, evidently affected by the choice
of reactor conditions, including growth temperature, oxidizing agents,
and deposition cycle time parameters. In an earlier study devoted
to ALD of Fe2O3 from FeCp2 and O3, the growth rates reaching 0.09–0.12 nm/cycle were
measured.10 In this study, however, the
metal precursor and ozone pulse lengths were extended to truly high
values, over 40 and 200 s, to achieve saturation in growth rate versus
precursor pulse length dependences. The growth temperature was also
rather low, 200 °C. Yet, in another process, where very short
precursor pulses, i.e., 2 s for ferrocene and only 0.2 s for ozone,11 were used, the growth rate of iron oxide was
0.022 nm/cycle at 200–220 °C, which is well comparable
to the rate observed in our present study. Somewhat surprisingly,
the growth rates of the Fe2O3 films registered
in the present study are inferior to those observed earlier in an
ALD process using FeCp2 and oxygen as Fe2O3 precursors under analogous conditions.12 In the latter study, where the ferrocene and oxygen pulse
lengths were 3 and 7 s, respectively, Fe2O3 films
grew with the rate of 0.14 nm/cycle at temperatures comparable to
that applied in the present study. By contrast, a growth per cycle
of 0.03–0.04 nm has been obtained for the FeCp2–O3 process at 400 °C.13 Most
importantly, it has been revealed that the incubation time that depends
on substrate pretreatment might exceed even 200 cycles in this ALD
process on the SiO2/Si substrates.13 This explains why the growth rates obtained in different experiments
and for different kind of structures differ significantly. For instance,
the growth rate 0.1 nm per cycle was obtained for the Fe2O3 sublayers deposited in the present work by applying
20 FeCp2–O3 cycles after 300 Er(thd)3–O3 cycles (Table 1). Earlier also, the Er2O3 films have been grown with a higher rate, 0.235 nm/cycle,
from Er(thd)3 and O3 precursors at 300 °C.14 In the latter study, a deposition reactor enabling
higher gas flow rates were exploited, and 2.5 s long ozone pulses
after 1.25 s long metal precursor pulses were applied. Thus, depending
on the reactor conditions and the choice of cycle time parameters,
certain diversity appears concerning the growth rate of the target
material. In the case of multicomponent materials, one has to consider
the experimental results characteristic of a particular setup, taking
into account the largest variations expected to occur during the first
deposition cycles of one oxide onto another.

The marked difference in
the growth rates of constituent oxides
later necessitated the application of much higher amounts of Er2O3 growth cycles, compared to those for Fe2O3 to deposit multilayer-like structures consisting
of distinctive Er2O3 and Fe2O3 layers. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis revealed that
the cycle ratio of 50:5 or 60:3 resulted in the highest Er/Fe atomic
ratios, which were still markedly lower than that for the stoichiometric
erbium ferrite ErFeO3 (Table 1). One should consider that, in the case
of ALD, few deposition cycles, such as 1–5 applied here for
the growth of each Fe2O3 layer, do not suffice
for the formation of chemically and structurally defined single metal
oxide, but result in the growth of a discontinuous submonolayer of
metal oxide. As a consequence, this should result in a mixture of
oxides rather than a multilayer structure. Further, taking into account
that tens of erbium oxide deposition cycles applied between iron oxide
deposition cycles resulted in films containing more than 2 times lower
amounts of erbium compared to iron, the films deposited cannot be
regarded as nanolaminates (multilayers) but rather the mixtures of
two different metal oxides. In the case of relatively low amounts
of Er2O3 applied, the films may even be regarded
as those of erbium (oxide) doped iron oxides.

Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images demonstrated that the
surfaces of Er2O3:Fe2O3 films were quite smooth without significant features referring to
a polycrystalline structure (Figure 1). The morphology of the films obviously depended somewhat
on the growth recipe. High relative amounts of Er2O3 growth cycles (Er2O3:Fe2O3 cycle ratios of 60:3 and 50:1) resulted in amorphous
and, consequently, smoother films compared to those grown using low
amounts of Er2O3 growth cycles (1:1). The bird-eye
SEM images visually implied certain tiny grainlike features on the
surface of the films grown using cycle ratios 50:1 and 50:5. These
are not, however, to be taken as direct indications of the crystal
growth, but rather small-sized agglomerations of disordered material
often visible on the images taken from X-ray amorphous film surfaces.
As will later be seen from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, the crystal
structure is not fully formed in these films. It should also be taken
into account, that the film thicknesses are not to be necessarily
and directly compared to each other based just on the numbers of constituent
oxide cycles because the nucleation delays for the constituents and
their corresponding growth rates at the early growth stages may differ
considerably. The detailed and, thus, extensive studies of these effects
remained beyond the scope of this work. However, an amorphous film
was grown to a relatively high thickness exceeding 50 nm using the
Er2O3:Fe2O3 cycle ratios
of 3:1 specifically to examine the possibility to grow oxides, using
that particular precursor chemistry, onto three-dimensionally (3D)
designed silicon-based substrates. As one can see in Figure 1, the film could be grown along
the depth of ca. half micrometer in trenches build into a silicon
wafer substrate with the aspect ratio 20:1, with certain amount of
the growing material reaching the bottom of the trenches, although
the nucleation of the solid layer was apparently not uniform throughout
the whole depth.

X-ray diffraction studies on the films with very
low Er content,
i.e., on the films grown using Er2O3:Fe2O3 cycle ratios of 1:1 on SiO2/Si, clearly
revealed a crystal growth (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns of
Er2O3:Fe2O3 films on SiO2/Si substrate (upper panel), and on TiN/Si substrate (lower
panel). Also shown is the pattern measured from the 4 nm thick reference
Er2O3 film (upper panel). The cycle ratios (Er2O3:Fe2O3) are denoted by
labels (see Table 1). The reflections are denoted with Miller indexes corresponding
to hematite, cubic Er2O3, and orthorhombic ErFeO3.

For this film, the reflections
can be indexed considering only
the rhombohedral hematite phase of iron oxide (PDF card 033-0664).
One may actually consider also multiphase, more disordered, nature
of the film with contribution from iron oxide phases with similar
stoichiometry but different lattice, such as that of the hexagonal
Fe2O3 with reflections 017, 116, and 204 at
24.6, 33.8, and 36.462°, respectively (PDF card 040-1139), which
actually more precisely coincide with the centers of the gravity of
the reflection peaks registered. Trace reflections from orthorhombic
Fe2O3 with 020 at 36.191° (PDF card 047-1409)
may be considered as well. However, it is worth noting that the same
films grown on ca. 5 nm thick TiN layer (Figure 2) were also crystallized, whereas the locations
of the reflections gave better fit with those of hematite. The iron-free Er2O3 film grown to the thickness of 4 nm was obviously not entirely
amorphous but exhibited a nanocrystalline nature with a broad 222
peak around 29.5–30° (Figure 2). Small thickness of the film was evidently
the main reason for the small size of crystallites leading to this
kind of diffraction pattern. Further, the films grown with cycle ratios
allowing larger, measurable, erbium-to-iron cation ratios occurred
essentially amorphous. Exceptionally, the film grown with the Er2O3:Fe2O3 cycle ratio of 50:5
demonstrated a pattern with a broad peak at around 33.2°, which
just may be attributed to the 112 reflection from ErFeO3 (PDF card 047-0072), and thus allowing one to consider partial formation
of the nanocrystalline erbium ferrite phase. The phase determination
here remains ambiguous and, in fact, incomplete. The broad band formed
between 30 and 35° in the diffractogram of the film grown with
the cycle ratio of 50:5 allows one to consider the formation of a
multiphase nanostructure and nucleation of iron-rich ErFe2O4 and/or Er2Fe5O12 (ICPDS
card 023-0240) phases. This may occur possibly also because of the
excess of iron content in accord with the measured Er/Fe atomic ratio
(see Table 1). The
appearance of the latter iron-rich phases was considered possible
also in the ALD-grown Er–Fe–O films earlier.8

Magnetic and Electric Behavior
Magnetic
measurements
were performed with the magnetic field applied in plane of the surface
of the substrate for the Er2O3:Fe2O3 films. The structures demonstrated a ferromagnetic-like
behavior at room temperature with saturation magnetization (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Representative magnetic
moment vs external magnetic field strength
curves measured from all of the Er2O3:Fe2O3 films deposited, as shown in the upper panel,
whereas the lower panel represents the magnetization curves from films
grown using relatively lower amounts of Er2O3 cycles, designated together with cycle ratios (60:3)–(1:1)
in the upper panel, in a larger scale. For the film thicknesses, see Table 1.

One could see that the films containing Er2O3 and Fe2O3 layers deposited using relatively
large amounts of growth cycles separately for constituent oxides,
i.e., 300 cycles for Er2O3 and 20 cycles for
Fe2O3, demonstrated a markedly stronger magnetization
than the more homogeneously mixed Er–Fe–O films. The
saturation magnetization in the film denoted with the cycle ratio
(300:20) was 5.3 emu/m2, i.e., 10 times higher than that
in the mixed/doped Er2O3:Fe2O3 films, regardless of the lower thickness compared to that
of the films with a more uniform distribution of erbium.

It
is known that the magnetic properties of nanostructures can,
besides chemical composition, markedly depend on defects, morphology,
phase, and growth recipe. The magnetization in the composites or mixtures
containing iron oxide could be enhanced by increasing the relative
content of iron oxide in the materials deposited, as we have observed,
for instance, in Bi2O3–Fe3O4 films grown by ALD15 or
Fe3O4–MgO by ALD.16 It is likely that in our most strongly magnetized sample,
the Fe2O3 interlayers, despite their X-ray amorphous
nature, were still formed as stoichiometric iron oxides, although
in a short-range order only, thereby giving the most prominent magnetic
response in this sample series. It is to be noted that in ErFeO3 films with a defined structure grown by pulsed laser deposition,
certain magnetization-field hysteresis was registered at 130 K at
the highest.5 Further, in the films grown
in the present study, the monotonic relationship between the Er/Fe
cation ratio and the magnetization was not recognized (see Figure 3). The Er–Fe–O
films deposited by ALD earlier8 have demonstrated
a somewhat analogous magnetization-field behavior with saturation
magnetization not exceeding 30% from that of iron oxide. In the latter
study, however, the coercivity was somewhat better defined, approaching
1 T.

In Figure 4, the
capacitance–voltage curves measured from the metal–insulator–metal
(MIM)-type capacitor structures are depicted.

Figure 4 Capacitance–voltage
curves of Al/Ti/Er2O3:Fe2O3/TiN/Ti/Si/Al capacitor structures
containing Er2O3:Fe2O3 films deposited using constituent oxide cycle ratios indicated by
labels, measured at 100 kHz.

The capacitance–voltage (C–V) curves are, in a satisfactory approximation, characteristic
of those commonly seen with metal–insulator–metal (MIM)-like
structures with quite leaky dielectric layers, i.e., with certain
plateau tending to appear around zero bias voltages, and further deviations
in the effective capacitance with increase in the absolute bias values.17−19 In the present case, the decrement of capacitance at larger biases
is obvious, especially in the films with relatively low thicknesses,
i.e., those grown with the cycle ratios 300:20, 60:3, or 50:1. One
can propose that capacitance is influenced, besides the major affections
from the film thickness and permittivity, also by the conductivity
of the films, enabling leakage of charge carriers. Charge accumulation
at two-dimensional defect layers caused by the deposition of small
amounts or Er2O3 embedded in Fe2O3, as well as at the electrode–film interfaces, is possible
reason for this influence. Indeed, separate measurements carried out
to record the conductance of the materials against the bias voltage
revealed that the curves built up on values approximately reciprocal
to those of the capacitance (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Conductance–voltage curves of Al/Ti/Er2O3:Fe2O3/TiN/Ti/Si/Al capacitor
structures
containing Er2O3:Fe2O3 films deposited using constituent oxide cycle ratios indicated by
labels, measured at 100 kHz.

It is thus likely that the decrement of the capacitance at
higher
biases is due to the formation of double (multiple) capacitances in
series throughout the layered stack of oxides, together with their
interfaces to electrodes, as well as possibly, at the barriers in
the “bulk” of oxide films consisting of layers with
variable structure and chemical composition. The variations may arise
already from the nature of ALD proceeding via a sequential deposition
of the constituent compound materials.

Assuming that the oxide
film does form the thickest part of capacitive
stack of layers and thus dominates in the series of capacitors, it
is still possible to roughly estimate the average permittivity of
the oxide-based films, taking into account the capacitance values
recorded under alternating current component of the applied voltage
at zero bias. The relative permittivity of the stacked material can
then simply be calculated taking into account the parallel-plate capacitor
model. It is thereby also to be considered that the permittivity calculated
in this manner does not reflect the physical property of the metal
oxide layer alone, but it is deviated by the charge-polarized and
concurrent fields built up at the interface layers. Therefore, the
permittivity calculated from the capacitance measured must be lower
than the one truly characteristic of the metal oxide layer, and the
detrimental effect of the interfaces must increase with decrease in
film thickness. Nevertheless, the estimated permittivities for the
5, 19.5, and 14.9 nm thick films grown using the cycle ratios of 300:20,
50:5, and 50:1 (see Figure 5) were as high as 9.4, 20.6, and 25.3, respectively, at zero
bias and 100 kHz. In these films, the relative content of erbium was
high enough to allow at least partial formation of the iron-rich ferrite
phases (see Figure 2). Of course, one cannot exclude the interference of leakage, as
was noted above, which may, as opposed to the effect of interface
layers, give rise to the apparent capacitance as measured. Further,
the permittivity of the amorphous 5.2 nm thick film grown with the
cycle ratio of 60:3 was only 2.3. Note, that the estimations were
made without the corrections taking account the likely effects of
interfacial layers and series capacitances inevitably affecting the
total capacitance values.

Regarding the literature data, polycrystalline
hematite α-Fe2O3 has demonstrated the
relative permittivity close
to unity or even lower20,21 at frequencies close to 100 kHz
used in the present study. The ternary compounds of erbium, iron,
and oxygen would exhibit a markedly higher permittivity. Polycrystalline
ErFeO3 ceramics have been described as materials possessing
permittivity values exceeding 60 at 2 kHz.22 Both polycrystalline23 and single-crystalline24 ErFe2O4 have been characterized
as materials with a large dielectric constant in the order of 104. In the present study, the calculated permittivity may thus
indeed be partially influenced by the phase composition of oxide films,
being higher in the films in which short-range order may resemble
that of orthoferrites and lower in the films with major contribution
from crystalline hematite, in addition to the amorphous parts and
interfaces.

The films grown demonstrated noticeable leakage
currents, as can
be seen in Figure 6. Although the dielectric breakdown in the films was not observed,
the currents increased rapidly with the applied voltage under the
electric fields ranging over few MV/cm. One could expectedly obtain
a relatively lower leakage in the mainly amorphous films. In general,
it is evident that the currents through the stacks are to be considered
as factors able to affect the charge polarization at the layer interfaces.

Figure 6 Leakage
current–field curves of Al/Ti/Er2O3:Fe2O3/TiN/Ti/Si/Al capacitor structures
containing Er2O3:Fe2O3 films deposited using constituent oxide cycle ratios indicated by
labels. For the sample thicknesses and composition, see Table 1.

Polarization charge vs applied voltage (P–V) characteristics measured on Al/Ti/Er2O3:Fe2O3/TiN/Ti/Si/Al structures
in Sawyer–Tower
circuit are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Polarization charge vs voltage applied to the capacitive elements
in Sawyer–Tower circuit for Er2O3:Fe2O3 films with cycle ratios denoted by labels.

One can see that the samples fabricated
with cycle ratios 300:20,
50:5, and 50:1 exhibited a certain, rather quadratic, hysteresis loop
(Figure 7, upper panel)
and the films possessed charge polarization measured at room temperature.

One can also see that the charge polarization does not quite proceed
in the form of the classical hysteresis loop characterizing ferroelectric
materials, as there is no defined plateau apparent in polarized charge
against increasing voltage (field). Quite likely, significant amount
of the charge, responsible for the effectively measurable polarization
in the material deposited, is drifting in the material under external
field and becomes trapped at the interfaces between metal oxide and
the electrode layers, causing interfacial polarization. Consequently,
the electrical charge becomes carried to and trapped at the interface
layer under certain polarity, and an opposite polarity with increasing,
oppositely directed, field is required to release the charge from
the traps, which is the main cause for the apparently spontaneous
charge polarization between 0.8 and 1.8 nC over an electrode with
an area of 0.024 mm2. On the other hand, somewhat analogous
polarization-field behavior has been observed and recorded for pulsed
laser-deposited hexagonally structured ErFeO3 films4,5 and, together with magnetization behavior, was designated as a signature
of the multiferroic performance of that material.

Conclusions
In summary, the atomic layer deposition of Er2O3:Fe2O3 thin films with Er/Fe atomic
ratios up to 0.46 was realized. All of the samples exhibited saturation
magnetization and charge polarization measured at room temperature.
Promising results in terms of the simultaneous appearance of internal
magnetization and certain electrical charge polarization were demonstrated
in planar Er2O3:Fe2O3 structures.
Further electrical and magnetic modeling and analysis will be needed
to elaborate the phenomenon and optimize the material structure for
magnetoelectric performance.

Experimental Section
The films were
deposited in a flow-type in-house built hot-wall
ALD reactor25 using Er(thd)3 and FeCp2 as metal precursors and O3 as an
oxygen precursor. N2 (99.999%) was used as the carrier
and purge gas. In all of the cases, an ALD cycle was started with
a metal precursor pulse and continued with a purge of the reaction
zone with pure carrier gas, followed by oxygen precursor pulse and
another purge. To obtain sufficient precursor pressures, the Er(thd)3 source temperature was set at 160 °C and FeCp2 source was set at 60 °C. The Er2O3:Fe2O3 films and laminate structures were grown at
375 °C by applying certain numbers of constituent binary oxide
growth cycles alternately (Table 1). The cycle times were 5–5–5–5
s for the sequence of metal precursor pulse–purge–ozone
pulse–purge. To obtain films with different composition starting
with very light doping and ending with almost laminated structures,
the ratio of the cycle numbers used for the deposition of Er2O3 and Fe2O3 was varied keeping
the total number of cycles approximately at the same level for all
of the samples. The substrate temperature of 375 °C was chosen
to achieve appreciable compromise between the temperatures suited
to both metal precursors. β-Diketonates are expected to decompose
thermally rather intensely at 400 °C and higher temperatures,
whereas the reactivity of ferrocene and, concurrently, the growth
rate of iron oxide would decrease notably with the decrease in substrate
temperature below 350 °C.

The mass thickness and elemental
composition of the films were
measured by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy method using ZSX400 (Rigaku)
spectrometer. For the calibration of the measurement procedure, we
used binary Er2O3 and Fe2O3 films with known thicknesses and densities determined by the X-ray
reflection (XRR) method. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD)
was applied for structural studies, and all of the XRD and XRR studies
were carried out with Smartlab (Rigaku) X-ray analyzer using Cu Kα
radiation. In addition, thicknesses of a series of films with different
compositions were determined using GES5E (Sopra-Semilab) spectroscopic
ellipsometer. The morphology of nanostructures on the Si substrate
and on three-dimensional (3D) substrates were investigated by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) using a Dual BeamVR equipment Helios NanoLab
600 (FEI) equipped with a focused ion beam (FIB) module. The FIB was
employed for the preparation of samples on the 3D-configured substrate
stack.

The films grown on Si substrates (Table 1) were subjected to magnetic measurements.
The measurements were performed by using a vibrating sample magnetometer
option of a physical property measurement system 14 T (Quantum Design).
Rectangular samples with dimensions of around 5 × 4 mm2 were fixed with general electric varnish on the commercial quartz
sample holders (Quantum Design). The magnetization was measured at
room temperature (350 K) and in the presence of a magnetic field of
79.6 kA/m parallel to the film surface. Magnetization isotherms were
measured by scanning the magnetic fields from −4800 to +4800
kA/m. The films subjected to magnetometry were grown on nondoped silicon
also without an additional TiN electrode layer. This was to avoid
possible interferences by magnetization signal and noise from the
substrates. The diamagnetic signal arising from the pure silicon substrate
was subtracted from the general magnetization curve for all of the
samples in which ferromagnetic-like response was detected.

To
carry out the electrical measurements, metal–insulator–metal
(MIM) structures were prepared. Silicon substrates with 5 nm thick
TiN layers grown by chemical vapor deposition were used as bottom
electrodes. Top electrodes with an area of 0.204 mm2 were
formed by the electron beam evaporation of 30 nm thick Ti layers directly
in contact with Er–Fe–O film, followed by the evaporation
of 120 nm thick Al on Ti through a shadow mask. The electrical characterization
techniques used were capacitance–voltage (C–V) and current–voltage (I–V) measurements. The electrical measurements
were done by means of an Agilent DXO-X 3104 digital oscilloscope with
a built-in wave generator. The standard Sawyer–Tower experiment
was carried out by applying a periodic triangular stimulus and recording
the voltage loops data from the oscilloscope. The charge values were
obtained from the sensed voltage across a stated capacitance.
