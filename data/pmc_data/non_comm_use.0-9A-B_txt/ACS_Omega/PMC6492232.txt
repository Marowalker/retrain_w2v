Rh(III) catalysts can promote a formal
(4 + 2) intramolecular oxidative
annulation between acrylic or benzoic acid derivatives and alkynes.
The reaction, which involves a C–H activation process, allows
for a rapid assembly of appealing bicyclic pyran-2-ones and tricyclic
isocoumarin derivatives in moderate to good yields. The α-pyrone
moiety of the products provides for further manipulations to obtain
relatively complex cyclic skeletons in a very simple manner.

Introduction
Ongoing progress in
modern chemical synthesis depends on the invention
of new transformations that allow a target-relevant increase in complexity
without the generation of byproducts or atomic waste.1 In this context, the functionalization of “inert”
C–H bonds using transition-metal catalysis represents a particularly
appealing strategy.2 Most of the C–H
activation reactions consist of couplings, cyclization, and halogenation
or acetoxylation processes. However, in recent years, there has been
an increasing number of reports on processes that couple the C–H
activation with a formal cycloaddition, many of them using alkynes
as reaction partners.3,4 These strategies represent very
powerful alternatives to classical cycloadditions of unsaturated substrates
and are especially attractive to ensemble heterocyclic products.5

One of the landmark advances in this topic
consists of the annulation
between benzoic or acrylic acids and alkynes to give isocoumarin or
α-pyrone products. This reaction has been performed using rhodium,6 ruthenium,7 and even
cobalt complexes8 and provides one of the
simplest ways to ensemble these types of oxacyclic skeletons from
simple precursors. Remarkably, despite the synthetic value of the
reaction, we are not aware of the development of intramolecular variants.
Tethering the alkyne to the acrylic or benzoic acid moiety would not
only allow controlling the regioselectivity, which is an issue in
the intermolecular processes, but also provide for a higher increase
in skeletal complexity.

In 2013, we reported one of the first
intramolecular formal annulations
involving C–H activations. The reaction, shown in Scheme 1A, involved an acrylamide
and a N-tethered alkyne and provided a practical entry to isoquinoline
products.9 In the case of the acrylic acid
derivatives, the alkyne must be tethered to the carbon instead of
the oxygen atom of the acid. The C–H activation would generate
a rhodacycle, which after migratory insertion of the alkyne and reductive
elimination should produce the bicyclic lactone adducts (Scheme 1B). Noteworthy, α-pyrones
and related lactones fused to other rings are present in many natural
products (Scheme 1C)
and therefore the technology might find important synthetic applications
in the future.

Scheme 1 Intramolecular Annulations and Natural Products with
Polycyclic Pyrone
Cores
Herein, we present the first
examples of intramolecular, formal
(4 + 2) annulations between acrylic acids and alkynes.10 The methodology can be extended to benzoic acids
and pyrrole-3-carboxylic acids, providing for the assembly of interesting
polycycles in just one catalytic step. Importantly, we also present
preliminary examples on the manipulation potential of the resulting
pyrones.

Results and Discussion
The viability of the annulation
was studied on precursor 1a, readily assembled from phenylpropynol
and methyl buta-2,3-dienoate
(see the Supporting Information). At the
outset, we were concerned about the C–H activation step, as
it might be compromised by the presence of substitution in the β-carbon
of the acrylic acid moiety. However, we were pleased to find that
the treatment of 1a with 2.5 mol % [Cp*RhCl2]2 in tert-amyl alcohol at 100 °C,
using 2 equiv of copper diacetate as oxidant, generates the desired
cycloadduct, which was isolated in 50% yield (entry 1, Table 1). Using dimethylformamide (DMF)
as solvent, the yield was lower (entry 2); however, switching the
oxidant to silver carbonate, we obtained the expected pyrone 2a in 82% yield (entry 3).

a Reaction conditions:
0.20 mmol of 1a, catalyst (2.5 mol %), 2 equiv of Ag2CO3, solvent (0.8 mL), 12 h. Yields determined
by internal standard.

b Cu(OAc)2·H2O (2 equiv) instead of Ag2CO3.

c Isolated yield.

d 5 mol % of catalyst.

e 1 equiv of Ag2CO3.

With other solvents,
such as 1,2-dichloroethane, toluene, or MeOH,
we observed poorer conversions. Interestingly, using [(p-cymene)RuCl2]2 as catalyst, which had been
previously used in intermolecular annulations, the yield was modest
(entry 7), whereas with [Cp*IrCl2]2, the starting
material was fully recovered (entry 8). The cationic catalyst [Cp*Rh(CH3CN)3](SbF6)2 also resulted
in a less effective process (entry 9). The yield of the product was
also lower when only 1 equiv of silver carbonate was used (entry 10).

With the optimized conditions at hand, we studied the scope with
other precursors (see Table 2). The reaction is also efficient with acrylic acid derivatives
featuring longer connecting tethers and therefore products with 6-
and 7-membered rings containing either a fully carbon chain or an
ether were obtained in good yields (2b–e, 50–73%).
Further enlarging the connection slows down the reaction and thus
the 8-membered product 2f was isolated in low yield (12%).
The presence of an aliphatic substituent (n-Bu) instead
of the phenyl ring in the alkyne is tolerated, albeit the yield was
slightly lower (2g, 49%). A methyl group in the α-position
of the acrylic acids does not compromise the reaction, and the expected
adducts were obtained in good yields (2h and 2i, 52–80%). We also found that the reaction is efficient with
substrates containing other aromatic substituents at the alkyne, with
either electron-rich (2j and 2k, 75 and
90% yield) or electron-deficient groups (2l, 63% yield),
as well as for heteroaromatic substituents (2m and 2n, 56 and 73% yield). We have also tested the reaction in
a precursor bearing a nitrogen atom in the connecting tether. The
reaction worked, but the product 2o was isolated in lower
yield .

Acidsa
a Conditions: 50 mg of 1, 2 equiv of
Ag2CO3, 2.5 mol % of [Cp*RhCl2]2, DMF (0.3 M), 120 °C, 12 h. Isolated yields.

At this point, we also assayed the
reaction with benzoic instead
of acrylic acid derivatives. These precursors were readily synthetized
from commercially available products in one or two steps (see the Supporting Information). Using the same conditions
as above, we obtained the expected products 2p and 2q, featuring 6- and 7-membered rings in 47 and 77% yields,
respectively (Table 3). Interestingly, we also demonstrated that N-alkyl
3-carboxy pyrroles 1r and 1s participate
in the process to give the corresponding adducts 2r and 2s featuring seven- and eight-membered rings in excellent
yields (80 and 73% respectively). Pyrrole-fused polycyclic products
are present in many natural compounds and therefore this methodology
might provide an easy way to generate these types of structures.

Table 3 Scope for Aromatic Substratesa
a Conditions:
50 mg of 1, 2 equiv of Ag2CO3,
2.5 mol % of [Cp*RhCl2]2, DMF (0.3 M), 120 °C,
12 h. Isolated yields.

Although
the above cycloadducts are of intrinsic interest, we envisioned
that the pyrone structure might allow designed manipulations to obtain
other relevant scaffolds. Therefore, the treatment of product 2e with potassium hydroxide in ethanol at room temperature
promoted a quantitative conversion to the keto-carboxylic acid 3. Formally, the transformation of 1e to 3 can be visualized as a cyclization/hydration process, something
that does not seem to be easy to achieve using alternative technologies
(Scheme 2).11

Scheme 2 Hydrolysis of the α-Pyrone
Moreover, the presence of a cis-diene in pyrone
adducts suggested the possibility of performing Diels–Alder
cycloadditions. Remarkably, the treatment of pyrone 2d, prepared in a 2 mmol scale from 1d, with 2 equiv of N-phenylmaleimide at 140 °C produced bis-adduct 4 in good yield and complete stereoselectivity. The structure
of this pentacyclic adduct was confirmed by X-ray diffraction crystallography
(see Scheme 3 and Figure 1).

Figure 1 X-ray structure of cycloadduct 4. Hydrogens omitted
for clarity.

Scheme 3 Cascade Diels–Alder
Processes
Conditions: (a) 2.05 mmol of 1d, 1.5 equiv of Ag2CO3, 2.5 mol % of
[Cp*RhCl2]2, DMF (10.2 mL, 0.2 M), 120 °C,
24 h, 77% yield.

This surprising transformation
can be explained in terms of a cascade
process involving several Diels–Alder reactions.12 An initial (4 + 2) Diels–Alder cycloaddition,
even between electron-deficient partners, is followed by a retro-cycloaddition
with concomitant extrusion of carbon dioxide. Finally, the resulting
intermediate reacts with another equivalent of maleimide through a
second Diels–Alder to form the polycyclic structure. Overall,
the transformation of 1d into 4 (two steps)
conveys the formation of five carbon–carbon bonds and five
cycles, therefore providing for an impressive increase in complexity
with total atom economy.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed the first examples of intramolecular
(4 + 2) annulations between acrylic acids and alkynes. The oxidative
annulation is promoted by Rh(III) catalysts and allows for the straightforward
assembly of bicyclic and tricyclic pyrone-containing adducts from
simple precursors. We also presented preliminary demonstrations of
relevant manipulations of the cycloadducts, including a remarkable
thermal cycloaddition cascade in the presence of an electron-poor
dienophile.

Experimental Section
General Comments
Dry solvents were
freshly distilled
under argon from an appropriate drying agent before use. Dried N,N-dimethylformamide was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. [RhCp*Cl2]2 (99%) [12354-85-7] and Ag2CO3 (99%) [534-16-7] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All other
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, TCI, Alfa Aesar, and
Strem-Chemicals and used without further purification. All reactions
dealing with air and moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out
in an oven-dried reaction flask under an argon atmosphere with dry
solvents. The abbreviation “rt” refers to reactions
carried out approximately at 23 °C. Reaction mixtures were stirred
using Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bars. Reaction temperatures
were maintained using Thermowatch-controlled silicone oil baths. Thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) was performed on silica gel plates, and components
were visualized by observation under UV light and/or by treating the
plates with p-anisaldehyde or phosphomolybdic acid
solutions, followed by heating. Flash chromatography was carried out
on silica gel unless otherwise stated. Dryings were performed with
anhydrous Na2SO4 or MgSO4. Concentration
refers to the removal of volatile solvents via distillation using
a Büchi rotary evaporator followed by residual solvent removal
under high vacuum. Melting points (mp) were determined with an M-560
BÜCHI apparatus. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 at 300 MHz (Varian), unless other solvents are specified. Carbon
types and structural assignments were determined from distortionless
enhancement by polarization transfer-NMR. NMR spectra were analyzed
using MestreNova NMR data processing software (www.mestrelab.com). 1,3,5-Trimethoxybenzene
was used as internal standard. The following abbreviations are used
to indicate signal multiplicity: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet;
q, quartet; dd, double doublet; ddd, doublet of doublet of doublets;
td, triple doublet; dt, doublet of triplets; dq, doublet of quartet;
m, multiplet; brs, broad singlet. Electrospray ionization mass spectra
(ESI-MS) were acquired using an IT-MS Bruker AmaZon SL at CIQUS and
also using chemical ionization (CI) electron impact (EI), electrospray
ionization (ESI), or atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI)
at the CACTUS facility of the University of Santiago de Compostela.
The reactions were monitored by TLC.

General Procedure for the
Annulation Reaction 
An oven-dried Schlenk tube equipped
with a septum and magnetic stirring
bar was charged with acrylic or benzoic acid (0.23 mmol), bis(dichloro(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)rhodium)
(2.5 mol %), silver carbonate (0.46 mmol), and DMF (0.8 mL). The reaction
mixture was then stirred at 120 °C. After 24 h, the reaction
mixture was concentrated in vacuum. Purification of the crude product
was done by flash chromatography on silica gel (1:10–1:3 EtOAc/hexane).

Synthesis of Acid 3
To a solution of 1-phenyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydrocyclohepta[c]pyran-3(5H)-one (2e) (50
mg, 0.21 mmol) in EtOH (1 mL) was added a saturated aqueous solution
of KOH (93.4 mg, 1.66 mmol, 10 M), and the reaction mixture was stirred
for 4 h at room temperature. The mixture was poured into an ice bath,
and then the solution was acidified by the addition of HCl (0.5 M).
EtOAc (5 mL) was added and the layers were separated. The aqueous
layer was extracted twice with EtOAc (2 × 5 mL), and the combined
organic extracts were washed with brine, dried, and concentrated under
reduced pressure. Purification of the crude product by flash chromatography
on silica gel (1:5–3:1 EtOAc/hexane) afforded the desired product
