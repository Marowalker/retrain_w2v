For
the determination of Metformin in human serum, a facile colorimetric
and spectrophotometric sensor was designed based on citrate-capped
gold nanoparticles (citrate-GNPs). In this probe, the addition of
Metformin to GNP solution generates a naked-eye color change resulting
from the aggregation of GNPs. Study of this color conversion and quantity
analysis of analyte is operated by spectrophotometric instruments.
The three factors pH, time, and GNP ratio were selected to examine
their effects on sensing results and their values optimization. The
optimization of parameters was done by means of central composite
design and one-at-a-time methods. The sensing results proved the highly
selective and sensitive performance of the sensor for Metformin in
a linear range of 6.25–133.3 ppm with a detection limit of
1.79 ppm. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the reported method
is 2.53%.

1 Introduction
Diabetes,
a worldwide disease, is classified in two types: type
1 or insulin-dependent and type 2 or noninsulin-dependent. Based on
reports published by International Diabetes Federation, the total
number of those suffering from diabetes is growing every year. For
instance, according to statistic predictions, type 2 diabetes, currently
affecting about 8% of adult population, would spread in such a pace
that by 2030, more than 40 million cases can be found throughout the
world.1−3 Metformin (N,N-dimethylbiguanide)
is a popular glucose-lowering agent that helps type 2 diabetic patients
in better insulin performance.4−8

Scientists have reported different diagnostic techniques for
Metformin
determination to study and monitor this drug in biological fluids.
Most techniques are based on high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet
(HPLC-UV), potentiometry, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS-MS), capillary electrophoresis-ultraviolet (CE-UV),
and thin layer chromatography (TLC). However, these methods have low
sensitivity and a time-consuming sample pretreatment procedure is
required.1,9−11

Gold nanoparticles
(GNPs) have been used in the field of catalysis,
metal ions, and biological molecule detection based on their optical
properties, electrical properties, biocompatibility, and numerous
extinction constants.12−18 One well-known optical aspect of GNPs is localized surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR) resulting from the interaction of conductive band
electrons with electromagnetic waves of the incident light. This interaction
results in the production of an LSPR with a frequency that depends
on the factors such as dielectric media, geometry, and distance between
nanoparticles.19−25

Aggregation in GNPs changes the interparticle distances and
leads
to a coupling and overlap between plasmon of nanoparticles, causing
a red shift in LSPR bands and naked-eye color changes in solution.20,21 This color changes can be used as a colorimetric sensor to determine
different targets. There is no need for complex instruments, and the
determination is performed via a simple optical tool.20,26−30

Therefore, in this study, we developed a simple and rapid
colorimetric
and spectrophotometric technique to determine Metformin in human serum
without utilizing any pretreatment and dilution procedure in the serum
sample with high selectivity and sensitivity. Upon the addition of
Metformin to the citrate-GNP solution, an aggregation in nanoparticles
occurred resulting in naked-eye color changes from red to gray and
appearance of a new peak in visible spectrum. Effects of the three
factors on Metformin sensing were investigated by central composite
design (CCD) and one-at-a-time methods. The important parameters such
as stability of sensing performance, selectivity, sensitivity, and
interferences efficacy were measured. This optical sensor reported
excellent findings for detecting Metformin in buffer and serum media.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of Citrate-Capped
Gold Nanoparticles
Citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (citrate-GNPs)
were synthesized
in water via the citrate-mediated reduction of HAuCl4.
First, an aqueous solution of 1 mM HAuCl4 was heated in
a flask fitted with condenser. When the solution was boiled, 10 mL
of 77.6 mM trisodium citrate solution was added to the above system
instantly. Second, the mixed solution was heated for another 10 min
under vigorous stirring. The solution’s color immediately changed
from pale yellow to ruby red, which indicates GNP formation. Reduction
of gold ions and capping of resulting nanoparticles, both occurred
by citrate ions. Finally, the heating was stopped, and the solution
was stirred until it reached room temperature. The final solution
should be stored at 4 °C for future experiments without
aggregation. The TEM image from the final solution proved the spherical
shape and mean size of citrate-GNPs (∼12.5 nm) (Figure 2a,b).

2.2 Measurements
The colorimetric determination
of Metformin was operated as follows: 1.5 mL of aqueous citrate-GNP
solution (GNP ratio is 0.3) was added to a glass cell, and 100 μL
of the standard solution of Metformin (in BR buffer with pH = 6.3)
was introduced to the above system. The mixture was shaken completely
at room temperature. The color of solution changed from ruby red to
gray, indicating the aggregation of GNPs in the presence of Metformin.
For quantity analysis of Metformin concentration, the same process
was gone through, and the visible spectra of GNPs were recorded from
400 to 800 nm, before and after the addition of Metformin.

2.2.1 Real Sample Analysis
To ensure
the reliability of the present probe, the buffer (pH = 7) and serum
were selected as real samples. The serum was collected from a medical
laboratory and just filtered with a 0.2 μm filtering paper.
A certain volume of Metformin standard solution (10 ppm to 1000 ppm)
was spiked into buffer and serum and then mixed entirely. GNP solution
(1.5 mL, GNP ratio is 0.3) was added to the cell, and 100 μL
of the real sample was later added to the above system. The results
were analyzed by means of a calibration curve previously plotted for
Metformin in different concentrations. The recovery of the sensor
was calculated as a result.

2.2.2 Data
Analysis and Statistical Software
Both CCD and one-at-a-time
methods were used to realize the effect
of pH, GNP ratio, and time on sensing performance. CCD method at five-level
was used to study the effect of two factors (pH and GNP ratio) on
the response of the reported colorimetric sensor. These factors and
their levels were selected based on our tests and previously published
papers. The high and low levels of each factor are shown below (Table 1). Design Expert software
version 7 was used to design the 14 random tests in two blocks and
analyze the data. The response of each test is the absorbance intensity
in 645–655 nm (Table S1).One-at-a-time
method was used to test the effect of time on the sensing performance.

2.3 Optical Properties and
Characterization of
GNPs
The analyzed characteristics of synthesized citrate-GNPs
are mentioned here. The synthesis of citrate-GNPs was confirmed by
observing the LSPR absorbance peak at λmax = 525
nm (Figure 1). Size
and shape of GNPs are proved by the TEM image. The TEM image of the
GNPs proved both the spherical shape and size distribution. The mean
size is 12.5 nm (Figure 2a,b). Figure 2 shows the DLS and zeta potential analyses
of nanoparticles. The average diameter was 11.9 nm with a PDI value
of 0.730. The zeta potential data revealed the information about the
charge on the surface of GNPs, which was negative here (−34.4
mV), and proved the presence of citrate on GNPs.

FT-IR analyses of neat trisodium citrate (blue line) and
citrate-GNPs
(red line) are presented in Figure 3. The broad band at 3000–3500 cm–1 in both spectra is related to the C–OH stretching vibration.
The sharp peaks around 1399 and 1585 cm–1 are for
the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of COO– in
trisodium citrate. However, these peaks were observed in the FT-IR
spectra of citrate-GNPs with a shift to highest values (∼1411
and 1585 cm–1) and indicate the formation of citrate
group on the surface of a new compound (GNPs).

2.4 Optimization
of Effective Parameters
The effects of each factor (pH and
GNP ratio) on colorimetric performance
of citrate-GNPs were studied by the CCD model. To test the validity
of the CCD model, the effect of parameters, and the interaction between
them, ANOVA analysis was applied.

The reliability of the predicted
model was documented by R2 and adjusted R2 In the reported probe, R2 was 0.9598 and adjusted R2 was
0.9311, which indicated high correlation between the experimental
result and the predicted model. Based on ANOVA data, F value of the model was 33.43, and P value less
than 0.0001, which proved that the model was significant. The lack-of-fit
(LOF) P value was (0.8842) not significant and confirmed
the acceptability of the model (Table S2). The normal plot of residuals and interaction between parameters
are illustrated in Figures S1 and S2, respectively.
Most residuals are close to the line and indicate the excellent relationship
between experimental results and the model. The R2 values approximate to 1. This plot shows the random
distribution of the points.

The optimal parameters of sensing
process are listed as follows:
pH = 6.1 and GNP ratio = 0.3. These optimal points were used in all
of the experiments.

The effect of time was studied by the one-at-a-time
method. In
a lower GNP ratio (0.1), the aggregation of GNPs occurred around 5
min after the addition of Metformin, as shown in Figure 4. But in a higher GNP ratio
(0.35), the aggregation occurred in about 10 s. Optimal ratio of GNPs
was 0.3 (based on result from the CCD models) so we chose 10 s as
the optimum time for reaction.

of GNPs in two ratios
(a) 0.1 and (b) 0.35.

2.5 Sensing
Mechanism
The reported sensor
was based on citrate-GNPs and acted as a medium for colorimetric detection
of Metformin in buffer and human serum samples. Citrate-GNPs were
synthesized via a simple and well-known one-step method with inexpensive
primary substances.

Additions of Metformin to GNP solution lead
to a rapid naked-eye color change from ruby red to gray. The change
occurred as a result of the aggregation of citrate-GNPs in the presence
of Metformin. The LSPR spectra of GNPs (λmax = 525
nm) decreased by the addition of Metformin, and a new peak around
645 nm appeared (Figure 5). Citrate-GNPs were negatively charged due to the presence of citrate
ions on their outer surface. These negative charges interacted strongly
with positively charged amine groups of Metformin via electrostatic
interaction to form a noncovalent conjugation between gold and Metformin.
The citrate-GNPs came closer to interact with amine groups of Metformin,
resulting in an aggregation in GNPs solution. The intensity of the
peak around 645 nm was proportional to the concentration of Metformin.

2.6 Analytical Characteristics
The response
of this sensor was tested by adding different concentrations of Metformin
in optimal conditions reported by the software. Figure 6 shows the relation between Abs and the Metformin
concentrations under the optimal experimental condition. The inset
of Figure 6 shows that
the Abs values have an appropriate linear correlation with the concentration
of Metformin in the range of 6.25–133.3 ppm. The linear regression
equation is y = 0.0062x + 0.2268,
where x is the concentration of Metformin (ppm) with
a corresponding regression coefficient of 0.9171 and signal-to-noise
ratio of 3 (S/N = 3) criterion. The detection limit of this sensor
is 1.79 ppm (Figure 6), which possesses an excellent performance. Furthermore, the analytical
efficiency of the reported citrate-GNP colorimetric probe for Metformin
detection is comparable to those reported.

after addition of Metformin in different
concentrations. (b) Linear calibration plot of Abs versus Metformin
concentration (ppm).

2.7 Selectivity
and Repeatability
To
test the selectivity of the reported colorimetric sensor, the effects
of two groups were studied. The first group was the ions and the second
one contained drugs and components that may exist in human serum.
Selection of possibly interfering ion was based on components of real
samples (serum), and the concentrations of these ions were selected
upon their natural amount in healthy human serum. In these tests,
a certain amount of each ion (Cl–, Na+, Mg2+, Fe3+, K+, Ca2+, H2PO4, and Cu2+), drugs (Ciprofloxacin
(CIP), Ibuprofen, Atorvastatin, Glibenclamide, and Doxorubicin (DOX)),
and components (methylene blue, fast green, glucose and fructose)
were added to citrate-GNP solution, and their effects were examined
according to the optimized procedures. Addition of some ions and components
in both groups showed no color changes and could not affect the colorimetric
performance of the sensor for Metformin. However, the others showed
the same color changes as Metformin, so we recorded their visible
spectra to understand their effects on the sensor. However, visible
spectra of no one were the same as those of Metformin. As shown in Figure 7a,b, the chosen ions,
drugs, and component possess no significant effect in the spectrophometric
performance of the Metformin determination sensor. The results indicate
that citrate-GNPs can be used as a selective colorimetric and spectrophotometric
sensor for Metformin detection in real samples.

ions and (b) drugs and compound on the
colorimetric sensing of Metformin.

To examine the repeatability of sensor results, two approaches
were adopted, yet through the entire tests, the measurement steps,
measuring apparatus, and working conditions were the same. First,
we performed four experiments over a day but in different hours. Then,
we repeated four experiments within four different days and calculated
the relative standard deviation (RSD %) for each set. As shown in Figure 8, the RSD values
are 1.04 and 1.33%, respectively. The RSD value is less than 5% and
indicates an excellent repeatability of the reported system.

(b) in a day (RSD = 1.33%)

2.8 Application in Real Samples
The presented
sensing system was applied to confirm the high efficiency of the citrate-GNP
sensing system in real samples; the sensor was tested in buffer and
human serum samples via standard addition techniques. The recovery
of Metformin for spiked samples was in the range of 96.36 to 99.61%,
whereas the mean relative standard deviation was 2.87. The sensor
results were listed in Table 2. The results showed that the designed sensor was selective
and sensitive for Metformin detection in real samples.

3 Conclusions
The findings of this study prove citrate-capped GNPs can be used
as a facile and low-cost sensor for colorimetric and spectrophotometric
determination of Metformin in buffer and human serum samples with
high selectivity and sensitivity. Citrate-GNPs were synthesized via
a simple and well-known one-step method and used as a colorimetric
base in this sensor. The presence of Metformin changed the color of
GNP solution from red to gray, resulting from the aggregation of GNPs.
The effects of selected parameters (pH, GNP ratio, and time) on the
sensing performance were optimized by CCD and one-at-a-time methods.
The experimental results matched the CCD model. The compatibility
of the model was confirmed by LOF, F, and P values. Furthermore, the reported sensor can perfectly
detect different amounts of Metformin in real samples. The proposed
method did not need any sophisticated apparatus or sample preparation
(Table 3) and can be
applied for routine analysis.
