Surface-engineered
nanostructured nonpolar (112̅0) gallium
nitride (GaN)-based high-performance ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors
(PDs) have been fabricated. The surface morphology of a nonpolar GaN
film was modified from pyramidal shape to flat and trigonal nanorods
displaying facets along different crystallographic planes. We report
the ease of enhancing the photocurrent (5.5-fold) and responsivity
(6-fold) of the PDs using a simple and convenient wet chemical-etching-induced
surface engineering. The fabricated metal–semiconductor–metal
structure-based surface-engineered UV PD exhibited a significant increment
in detectivity, that is, from 0.43 to 2.83 (×108)
Jones, and showed a very low noise-equivalent power (∼10–10 W Hz–1/2). The reliability of
the nanostructured PD was ensured via fast switching with a response
and decay time of 332 and 995 ms, which were more than five times
faster with respect to the unetched pyramidal structure-based UV PD.
The improvement in device performance was attributed to increased
light absorption, efficient transport of photogenerated carriers,
and enhancement in conduction cross section via elimination of recombination/trap
centers related to defect states. Thus, the proposed method could
be a promising approach to enhance the performance of GaN-based PD
technology.

Introduction
Ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors
(PDs) have drawn researchers’
interest because of their dynamic applications in rising global concerns
such as environmental pollution monitoring, cancer detection, flame
alarms, future memory storage, water purification, binary switches
in imaging techniques, space-to-space communication, and next-generation
defense warfare technology.1,2 The three spectral regions
in the UV range are UV-A (400–320 nm), UV-B (320–280
nm), and UV-C (280–200 nm), in which UV-B and UV-C rays with
shorter wavelength and higher energies are absorbed by the stratospheric
ozone layer, whereas UV-A with long wavelength passes through the
atmosphere onto the earth’s surface.3 Considering the importance of monitoring UV-A radiation, a highly
responsive and fast photodetective device is essential.

Commercially
available narrow band gap (Si, GaAsP, GaP, etc.)-based
PDs possess high noise and leakage currents, low operating temperature,
requirement of optical filters, etc., which hinder their integration
in wearable technologies.4 On the other
hand, wide band gap (WBG) semiconductors, being the ideal candidate
for the development of efficient UV PDs, can easily overcome the aforementioned
challenges.5 Among these, gallium nitride
(GaN) with direct WBG (3.4 eV) and superior material properties such
as high saturation velocity, high chemical stability, high carrier
mobility, high temperature, and frequency operation has proven its
potential for employment in UV photodetection under harsh environmental
conditions.6 GaN films grown along different
directions (polar or semipolar) exhibit polarization effect and variation
in chemical structure and electronic properties.7−9 The presence
of polarization-induced Stark effect in polar GaN films (c-plane) significantly affects the carrier transport and radiative
recombination,10 which initiated research
on exploring nonpolar GaN films for device fabrication.11−13 Nonpolar GaN structures enhance the performance of the device via
elimination of polarization-induced electric field and quantum-confined
Stark effect which may impede the device performance.8 To address the polarization effect, Mukundan et al. fabricated
polar and nonpolar GaN-based UV PDs, where nonpolar GaN-based UV PDs
produced enhanced responsivity and fast response time than polar GaN
UV PDs.12 Recently, Gundimeda et al. also
fabricated nonpolar GaN-based UV PDs and reported enhanced responsivity.13

Nanostructured devices offer quantum-,
surface-, dielectric-, and
optical-confinement effects, which lead to higher light absorption,
increased photoconductive gain, enhanced responsivity, and faster
switching.14,15 The high surface-to-volume (i.e.,
aspect) ratio of a nanostructured/textured film encourages scattering
of incident photons, reduces reflection losses, and increases the
absorption of incident radiation which ultimately contribute in enhancing
the device efficiency via direct or indirect mode. Besides, the low-dimensional
conductive channel of nanostructures could confine the active area
of charge carriers and shorten the carrier transit time.16−18 Theoretical reports19,20 as well as experimental findings21 reveal effective light trapping and significant
improvement in device performance using nanostructured/textured surfaces.

A nanostructured surface can be obtained either by the direct growth
of nanostructures, that is, by chemical vapor deposition, physical
vapor deposition (PVD) including sputtering/evaporation/epitaxial
growth method, etc., or via engineering the flat surfaces to develop
nanostructures using wet/dry etching processes.22−26 Kumar et al.27 proposed
the growth of InN- and GaN-based self-assembled flower-shaped nanostructures
via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), while Aggarwal et al.28 reported nanoflower decoration on GaN surfaces
to enhance light absorption in the fabricated UV PDs. However, compared
to growth-related challenges, surface engineering is a simple and
convenient approach to develop ordered nanostructures. Owing to its
high synthesis versatility, negligible surface damage, absence of
hydrogen contaminants, higher selectivity, simple execution, and low
cost, wet chemical etching is preferred over other techniques for
the fabrication of GaN micro- and nanostructures, which offers a huge
potential for detection applications.29 However, challenges regarding the impact of wet chemically etched
nanostructures on PD applications are yet to be explored.

In
the present article, we report chemically modified (using hot
KOH and H3PO4 solution) surface-engineered nonpolar
GaN PDs fabricated using the metal–semiconductor–metal
(MSM) approach. Photodetection studies were performed to analyze the
responsivity, detectivity, noise-equivalent power (NEP), rise time,
and decay time of the fabricated UV PDs. The highly ordered nanostructure-based
UV PDs displayed significant enhancement in device performance (compared
with the pristine film), ascertaining their potential in the development
of highly efficient GaN-based optoelectronic devices.

Results and Discussion
The morphological transformations of the surface-engineered GaN
film investigated via field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) analysis are represented in Figure 1. The unetched GaN film displayed pitted
morphology with uniformly distributed pyramidal-shaped faceted structures
(average size ≈ 400 ± 50 nm) over the surface. The etching
of pyramidal structures (PS) in hot KOH solution transformed the PS
into flat nanorods (FN) oriented toward the (11̅02) direction,
with their width varying between 60 and 300 nm. Further, FN were immersed
in H3PO4 solution which resulted in the development
of trigonal-shaped structures (TSS) along with a slight broadening
of the surface pits. The observed two facets of TSS were ascribed
to the (011̅0) and (101̅0) planes of the hexagonal GaN.
Finally, trigonal prism-shaped nanorods (TPN) with triangular termination
were developed when TSS underwent KOH etching. The width of the nanorods
was observed to be in between 70 and 320 nm. The side facets of the
TPN consisted of the same (011̅0) and (101̅0) planes,
whereas the triangular termination was attributed to the (011̅2)
and (101̅2) planes of the GaN wurtzite crystal structure (as
shown in the inset of Figure 1).

Figure 1 FESEM images displaying sample morphology after different stages
of etching: PS, FN, TSS, and TPN GaN films.

The existence of pentagonal pits was evident throughout the
etching
treatment, though a slight variation in the pit size was observed.
The root-mean-square (rms) roughnesses of the PS, FN, TSS, and TPN
films were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements
(Figure S1 of the Supporting Information) and were obtained as 3.9, 6.0, 6.8, and 29.0 (±0.2) nm, respectively.
The increment in the rms roughness indicates higher surface-to-volume
ratio of the surface-engineered nanostructures, which is expected
to increase the charge generation, eliminate the surface trap states
to minimize surface recombination, and ultimately improve the photoconductivity.
Moreover, because of the formation of the network structure, the surface
of the PD would have larger contact area, which results in enhanced
carrier collection and faster response time.30 Jung et al.31 reported that the etching
rate/mechanism in GaN has a direct correlation with the surface chemical
states. The GaN film in an alkaline medium reacts with water, leading
to the formation of gallium oxide which gets dissolved in the solution.31 The low activation energy of the chemical reaction
in the case of semipolar/nonpolar GaN films plays a critical role
in governing the etching rate of the reaction. The presence of negatively
charged hydroxyl (OH–) ions on the surface of nonpolar
GaN films promotes chemical etching and assists in faceting/texturing
of the surface along various crystallographic planes with higher chemical
stability.32−34 Further, the broadening of the pentagonal-shaped
surface pits in TSS and TPN can be explained based on their energetics.
The favorable energetics of the surface pits (ideal sites) for oxygen
chemisorption35 leads to the increment
of the size along with the dissolution of gallium oxide in the solution.

The intensity ratio of the defect band (∼2.1 eV) to near-band-edge
emission (∼3.4 eV), that is, IDEF/INBE, and current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the nanostructure-based
UV PDs under dark conditions along with the schematic of the fabricated
device are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a
shows the IDEF/INBE ratio as obtained from the room-temperature photoluminescence
(PL) spectroscopy (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information), which confirms the suppression of the defect
states in the surface-engineered GaN films. It is evident from the
results that IDEF/INBE decreases from PS to FN but increases further in TSS. However,
the TPN was observed to exhibit minimum defects with the least intensity
of IDEF/INBE. The I–V curve of the pristine
PS PD displayed a linear behavior, which became Schottky-type for
etched PDs (Figure 2c). The dark current values for PS, FN, TSS, and TPN were in the
order of 1 mA (±0.1 mA). Frequently, the thicknesses of the GaN
film utilized for photodetection are of the order of 3–5 μm.
However, the thickness of the GaN film utilized in this study was
very low ∼600 nm. Accordingly, the grown GaN thin film showcased
a slightly higher dislocation density in the film. Such high dark
current values are resulted because of the presence of more dislocations
which lead to defect-assisted tunneling in the grown GaN films (PS).
However, under UV illumination (325 nm, 13 mW cm–2), enhanced photocurrent values of 18.6, 78.8, and 84.3 μA
for FN-, TSS-, and TPN-based UV PDs were observed. The increment in
the photocurrent could be attributed to the following reasons: first,
the elongated nanorod structure leads to an increased delocalization
of electrons, thereby reducing the photogenerated carrier recombination.36,37 As a result, the surface-engineered GaN films displayed a threefold
enhancement in photocurrent (the difference between light and dark
currents) when compared with the PS. Second, elimination of surface
states (vacancies, adsorbates, contaminant, etc.) is related to defects/traps
that screen the effective charge transport and act as a recombination/trap
center.38 Also, the charge carrier extraction
was significantly improved because of the development of crystallographic
planes in chemically modified samples which behave as excellent light
scatterers.

band to near-band-edge emission of GaN samples. (b) Schematic diagram
representing the fabricated GaN UV PDs under 325 nm illumination and
(c) current–voltage curves under dark conditions, with the
inset displaying the optical image of the fabricated UV PDs.

Figure 3 represents
a model based on the energy band theory to understand the mechanism
of photocurrent conduction in fabricated UV PDs. Schematics of the
energy band diagram in dark and under UV illumination are depicted
in Figure 3a–c,
respectively. Prior to the deposition of gold electrodes, all parameters
such as work function of the metal and electron affinity of the semiconductor
are represented in Figure 3a. In thermal equilibrium, when the metal contacts the semiconductor,
alignment of Fermi levels takes place, leading to the formation of
a Schottky-type metal–semiconductor (MS) contact. The Schottky
barrier height was calculated to be around 1 eV considering the work
function of gold and the electron affinity of GaN. Because of symmetric
contacts, the width of the depletion region at the Au#1–GaN
interface is equal to that at the Au#2–GaN interface (Figure 3b). Under UV illumination,
generation of electron–hole pairs and transport and collection
of charge carriers take place (Figure 3c). Under applied bias (contact Au#1 is fed with negative
bias and contact Au#2 is fed with positive bias), the absorption of
light near the reverse-biased junction (GaN and Au#1) creates electron–hole
pairs which are separated, thus creating the photocurrent. The electrons
tend to move toward Au#2 because of the forward bias at the semiconductor,
which helps in reducing the built-in potential and allows charge collection.

dark and (c) under light conditions along with the applied bias for
the GaN UV PD.

The time-dependent photoresponse
of the fabricated UV PDs based
on nanostructured GaN films by periodically switching on and off the
light with a power of 13 mW cm–2, under varying
bias voltage (50 mV to 3 V), is depicted in Figure 4. When the light was turned on, a rise in
photocurrent approaching saturation value was witnessed, which decayed
after turning off the laser. The photocurrent increased with the applied
bias because of the enhancement in the generation and collection of
photoexcited charge carriers with increasing voltage. The fabricated
PDs displayed stable and repeatable results. The responsivity of the
fabricated PDs is defined as the photocurrent generated per unit power
of incident light on the effective area of a photoconductor, which
can be expressed as21 1  where ΔI is the photocurrent, P is the optical power density,
and A is
the device area. The calculated responsivity values of PS, FN, TSS,
and TPN GaN film-based UV PDs were 4.4, 5.6, 24.5, and 25.9 (±0.3)
mA W–1, respectively, at an applied bias of 3 V
(Table 1).

bias conditions.

Figure 5 represents
the variation in the photocurrent as well as the responsivity in the
UV PD of GaN films before and after etching. An increment of ∼1.3,
5.6, and 5.9 times the responsivity of FN-, TSS-, and TPN-based UV
PDs with respect to the pristine UV PD was observed. The sixfold increment
in the responsivity of the surface-engineered GaN UV PD is attributed
to the network-structured nanorods on the chemically modified surface.
It is noteworthy to mention that the material is the same in all fabricated
UV PDs; hence, the observed enhancement in responsivity was attributed
to either the increased photon absorption or efficient carrier transport.

Figure 5 Graphical
representation of the change in photocurrent and responsivity
of the GaN UV PDs fabricated before and after etching.

According to Garrido et al.,39 the photoconductive
responsivity is dependent on two factors: the photogenerated free
carriers (Δn) and effective conduction cross
section (ΔS). Therefore, the photoconductive
gain is dominated by the modulation in photogenerated carrier concentration
and effective conduction cross section. Hence, the expression for
the current responsivity can be redefined as39 2  where q is the electronic
charge, VB is the bias voltage, μe is the electron mobility, L is the distance
between the electrodes, and Popt is the
optical power. It is evident from eq 2 that the parameters affecting responsivity (directly
proportional) are photogenerated free carrier concentration and conduction
cross section. The conduction cross section is significantly affected
by the presence of defect states (dislocations, grain boundaries,
vacancies, voids, etc.) in the films. Upon illumination of light,
the defect states get charged and form a depletion region around them
which creates discontinuities in the transport of photogenerated carriers
and thus reduces the effective conduction cross section. Also, surface
states/imperfections may also act as trapping and recombination centers
and reduce the collection of carriers. It is important to mention
that these defect states do not hinder the absorption of incident
light, but they considerably reduce the conduction and collection
of photogenerated carriers. Therefore, the enhancement in responsivity
of the etched UV PDs can be attributed to the higher amount of photogenerated
carriers (because of the large surface area and reduced reflection)
and enhanced conduction cross section (because of the reduction in
the defect/surface states).

The two key figure-of-merit parameters
that determine the performance
of a PD are the NEP and detectivity. The NEP is defined as the optical
signal in watts at which the electrical signal-to-noise ratio in the
detector is equal to unity (0 dB), when the bandwidth is limited to
1 Hz and the detectivity is described as the capability of a PD to
detect the weakest light signal. The detectivity (D) and NEP of the fabricated nanostructured devices are expressed
by the following equation40 3  where 4  Here, Δf is the electrical
bandwidth and  is the measured noise. The calculated values
of detectivity and NEP are displayed in Table 1. The low NEP in the order of 10–10 W Hz–1/2 in surface-engineered nanostructured
UV PDs indicates very low noise power in the devices, which makes
them suitable candidates for highly sensitive GaN UV PDs. Accordingly,
on the basis of the responsivity and dark current, the detectivity
was calculated for all the fabricated surface-engineered UV PDs. The
pristine PD exhibited the lowest detectivity (0.43 × 108 Jones), whereas the surface-engineered PD demonstrated nearly sixfold
enhancement in detectivity, that is, 2.83 × 108 Jones.
It indicates that surface engineering is a convenient approach for
the development of efficient PDs which exhibit detectivity comparable
to that of silicon-based PDs.40−42

Figure 6 shows the
time-resolved photocurrent response of the device where the rise time
constant (time at which the photocurrent reaches 63% of its peak value)
and decay time constant (time at which the photocurrent reaches 37%
from its peak value) curves which are fitted (using mathematical equations)
in accordance with the experimental data from which the rise time
(time at which the device response rises from 10 to 90%) and decay
time (time at which the device response decreases from 90 to 10%)
are calculated. These rise and decay time constants are fitted by
the following equations43 5   6  where Io is the
maximum current at a particular time, τr is the rise
time constant, τd is the decay time constant, and t is the response time. The fitting results exhibited the
rise time of 1874, 1197, 395, and 332 (±10) ms and the decay
time of 3564, 1118, 1520, and 995 (±50) ms for PS-, FN-, TSS-,
and TPN-based UV PDs, respectively (as shown in Table 2). The lowest rise and decay time for TPN-based
UV PDs ensure fast response of the fabricated UV PDs after exposure
to UV radiation along with quick recovery time. It was observed that
the decay time was decreased in FN (1118 ms), but it further increased
for TSS (1520 ms) and ultimately the lowest value was achieved for
TPN (995 ms). The higher decay time observed in TSS with respect to
FN could be attributed to the higher defect states (as evident from
the PL results) which might have acted as a trap center and ultimately
increased the decay time. This can be explained based on morphological
aspects, where FN and TPN exhibited nanorod-like structures on the
surface. However, no such trend was observed in the rise time of the
devices.

data obtained for PS-, FN-, TSS-, and TPN-based UV PDs.

Constants (τr and τd) and the Calculated
Values of Rise and Decay Time (tr and td) of the Fabricated UV PDs

TSS	180	692	395	1520	
TPN	151	453	332	995	
The enhanced responsivity
observed in the surface-engineered UV
PDs (from 4.4 to 25.9 mA W–1) was attributed to
the formation of nanorods (low-dimensional structures) which can assist
in shortening the transient time of the photogenerated carriers and
ultimately boost the device performance. However, it was observed
that the responsivities of TSS- and TPN-based UV PDs are nearly similar,
but when the response time is considered, TPN-based UV PDs have faster
response time (332 ms) than TSS-based UV PDs (395 ms), which makes
them superior of all the surface-engineered PDs. The decay time of
surface-engineered UV PDs (995 ms) was observed to be much better
when compared to that of PS (3564 ms). The increment in decay time
usually occurs because of the phenomenon of persistent photoconductivity
(PPC). The occurrence of PPC in GaN is an inevitable phenomenon because
of the presence of defects, surface states, and oxygen contamination.44−46 The defect/surface/trap states get ionized when the incident radiation
falls and act as recombination centers for photogenerated carriers
after the light is switched off.47 The
efficiency of these trap states decreases with time (few milliseconds),
which leads to PPC and increases the decay time of devices. Hence,
the decrease in decay time of the chemically engineered UV PDs indicates
reduction in defect states in the nanostructured films. Also, the
response time (both on rise and decay) of the fabricated UV PDs is
better than most of the previously reported low-dimensional nanostructured
PDs, ranging from seconds to tens of minutes or even hours, which
is highlighted in Table 3.48−55 Therefore, by utilizing these surface-engineered structures, the
response time and recovery speed of MSM-based GaN UV PDs can be dramatically
reduced, which makes them ideal for the faster switching applications.

Conclusions
Surface-engineered
nanostructure-based nonpolar MSM-GaN high-performance
PDs are demonstrated for the detection of UV A radiation. Transformation
from PS to FN and TSS was observed after a three-step chemical etching
procedure. The chemically engineered UV PDs displayed significant
suppression of defect states, which ultimately improved the photoresponse
and enhanced the device performance. The triangular nanorod-based
TPN PDs displayed a responsivity of 25.9 mA W–1 compared
with 4.4 mA W–1 for PDs fabricated on the pristine
film. The detectivity of TPN PDs revealed a drastic increment of ∼6.6-fold,
while the NEP was reduced by ∼6.7 times. The nanorod-based
PDs ensured fast switching by reducing the response time to 332 ms
from 1874 ms. These enhancements occurred via increased light absorption
and higher conduction cross section in the developed nanostructures.
We conclude that surface-engineering-based nanostructured MSM-GaN
PD is a promising strategy to fabricate GaN-based efficient PDs.

Experimental
Section
The epitaxial a-plane GaN film was
grown on an r-plane sapphire substrate by a plasma-assisted
MBE (PAMBE,
Riber Compact 21) system equipped with standard Knudsen cells and
an ADDON radio frequency (rf) plasma source to supply active nitrogen
species. Prior to loading the substrate in the load-lock chamber,
the r-plane sapphire substrate was precleaned chemically
by degreasing in acetone for 2–3 min, followed by etching in
1:3 H3PO4/H2SO4 solution
at 60 °C for 5 min and further blowing with dry nitrogen gas.
In situ thermal annealing was carried out at 600 °C in the buffer
chamber to remove the residual contaminants from the substrate. Nitridation
of the substrate was performed at a low substrate temperature (450
°C). A low-temperature GaN buffer layer was deposited at 530
°C under Ga-rich conditions. The growth of GaN was performed
at 730 °C with a gallium beam equivalent pressure of 1.0 ×
10–6 Torr and an rf power of 500 W. After the epitaxial
growth of the a-plane GaN film on the r-plane sapphire substrate, post-annealing for 27 min was performed
in nitrogen plasma under ambient conditions to convert the remaining
adsorbed Ga adatoms into the GaN film. The pristine nonpolar GaN film
was initially etched with KOH solution and periodically immersed in
H3PO4 and KOH solutions afterward (as shown
in Figure 1). The temperature
of the solutions and etching time were kept constant at 80 °C
and 10 min, respectively. The etched films were then rinsed in distilled
water and dried by pressurized nitrogen gas. The samples in this article
are abbreviated as pristine pyramidal structure (PS), flat nanorods
(FN), trigonal shape structure (TSS), and trigonal prism shaped nanorods
(TPN), as witnessed from the observed surface morphology. MSM structure-based
UV PDs were fabricated by depositing gold contacts (thickness ≈
150 ± 5 nm and separation ≈ 600 ± 20 μm) onto
the film surface using the PVD technique. The morphology of the samples
was examined by Supra 40VP FESEM (Zeiss Germany). Photodetection measurements
were performed on a semiconductor parameter analyzer connected to
a probe station setup (Cascade Microtech EPS150TRIAX), which has shield
enclosure (EPS-ACC-SE750) for low-signal measurements. The spectrometer
was equipped with a focused laser (λ = 325 nm, power density
= 13 mW cm–2) for the generation and detection of
UV A radiation.
