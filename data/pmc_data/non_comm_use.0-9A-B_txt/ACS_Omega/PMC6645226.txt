Hyperbranched
polymers have attracted much attention in the field of UV-curable
coatings because of its low viscosity, highly branched structure,
and rich functional moieties. However, hyperbranched polymers also
have some limitations. For example, the spherical structure increases
the crosslinking hindrance, resulting in surplus functional moieties.
In this study, a multiarm star polymer with hyperbranched polyester
core and linear polymer arms was synthesized and used as UV-curable
coating. H40, the fourth generation of the hyperbranched polyester,
was chosen as the core owing to its low viscosity and high chemical reactivity. Poly(ε-caprolactone)
(PCL) arms were introduced to increase the content of flexible segments
and reduce the cross-linking hindrance. The terminal hydroxyls were
then replaced with methacrylate groups to endow the star polymer with
UV curable ability, yielding HPCLn-M. This multiarm
star polymer was considered as a promising candidate to make up for
the shortcomings of UV-curable coating made from the hyperbranched
polymer. The properties, such as hardness, adhesion, acid resistance,
and alkali resistance of cured films were enhanced obviously after
the grafting of PCL. Moreover, to further explore the effect of the
length of PCL grafts on the coating, star polymers with different
degree of polymerization (DP) were synthesized. Through the performance
tests of cured films, it was found that the multiarm star polymer
HPCLn-M could make up for the limitations of the
hyperbranched polymer when the DP of PCL was suitable, and the comprehensive
performance of cured film reached the best when the DP of PCL was
20. Overall, this multiarm star polymer could combine the advantages
of the hyperbranched polymer and linear polymer and has the potential
to be the next environmentally friendly UV-curable coating.

==== Body
1 Introduction
UV-curable
coating is considered as a kind of energy-saving and environmentally
friendly coating developed from 1960s.1,2 UV curing of
the polymers can be accomplished in tens of seconds, even faster.
UV-curable coatings contain less solvent, which reduces the emission
of volatile organic compounds (VOC). Besides, because no heating is
required, UV-curable coating avoids thermal damage and has a wide
range of applications. UV curing also consumes less energy than thermal
curing.3−7

Generally, the oligomers for UV-curable coatings are composed
of linear polymers, but the viscosity of linear polymers usually increases
dramatically with the increase of molecular weight. In order to obtain
the appropriate viscosity, plenty of reactive diluents or solvents
are often added, resulting in an increase in systemic toxicity.8−11 Therefore, polymers with low viscosity are necessary for UV-curable
coatings.

In recent years, hyperbranched polymers have attracted
much attention of being used as UV-curable coating because of the
unique structural characteristics. The three-dimensional spherical
structure endows hyperbranched polymers with lower viscosity and higher
solubility in many solvents, compareds to linear polymers with the
same molecular weight. The application of hyperbranched polymers in
UV-curable coating can reduce the content of reactive diluent and
solvent, which can reduce the emission of VOC. In addition, the abundant
functional moieties on the surface of spherical hyperbranched polymers
can increase the density of cross-linking sites, which results in
a high-density cross-linked network structure and a faster UV-curing
speed.12−18 Besides, functional coatings, such as protective coatings19 and antifouling coatings20 can be made by modifying the ending groups of hyperbranched
polymers.

However, the spherical structure of the hyperbranched
polymers increases the cross-linking hindrance to a certain extent
simultaneously, resulting in excess unreacted functional moieties;
and the excess functional groups in coating will reduce the stability
and resistance of the film.21,22 Besides, volume shrinkage
occurs rapidly during the UV-curing process of the polymer because
of the spherical structure. As a result, internal stress is generated
and the adhesion between coating and the substrate decreases. In contrast
to hyperbranched polymers, linear polymers have a higher reaction
degree in cross-linking.23,24 Thus, hyperbranched
polymers have limitations which could be compensated by linear polymers.25

In this study, we synthesized a multiarm
star polymer with a hyperbranched polyester core and poly(ε-caprolactone)
(PCL) arms (Scheme 1). The linear polymers are radially attached to the central core,
forming a star polymer.26−29 H40, the fourth generation of the hyperbranched polyester,
was chosen as the core moiety owing to its low viscosity and high
reactivity.30−33 PCL was chosen as the graft moiety because of its good compatibility,
good solubility, and safety. Linear PCL was grafted onto H40 to obtain
the multiarm star polymer (designed as HPCLn) by
ring-open polymerization.34,35 Methacrylation was
then carried out to endue polymers with cross-linking ability. Hyperbranched
polymer cores could provide low viscosity and rich functional groups,
whereas linear PCL arms could decrease the cross-linking hindrance
and increase the reaction degree of cross-linking. Also, this multiarm
star structure can prevent phase separation of the polymer with the
change of temperature. In addition, multiarm star polymers (HPCL-M)
with different degrees of polymerization (DP) were synthesized to
explore the effect of the length of PCL arms on the coating. The viscosity,
melting temperature, thermal stability, and cured film properties
(such as hardness, adhesion, acid resistance, and alkali resistance)
of HPCL-M were also explored. Then, we demonstrated that this multiarm
star polymer had a good performance in UV-curable coating applications
and could compensate up for the shortcomings of the hyperbranched
polymer.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Multiarm Star
Polymer H40-star-PCLn (HPCLn) and H40-star-PCLn(10∼30)-MAC (HPCLn-M)
Ring-opening polymerization was used to synthesize five kinds of
HPCLn as depicted in Scheme 1. Owing to the different feed ratios between
H40 and ε-caprolactone, HPCLn containing different
lengths of PCL arms were obtained. The DP and molecular weight of
multiarm star polymers are listed in Table 1.

d Practical value of DP calculated by 1H NMR.

e Molecular weight calculated by 1H NMR.

Taking HPCL20
as an example, the DP of PCL chains, the quantity of PCL arms in each
H40 core, and the molecular weights were obtained from the 1H NMR spectra (Figure 1a). The small signals appear at about 1.27 ppm corresponding to methyl
protons of the hyperbranched polyester. The signals at about 3.67
ppm can be assigned to the methylene protons next to the hydroxyl
terminus, whereas the signals at about 2.34 ppm can be attributed
to protons on methylene groups adjacent to ester groups in the repeating
unit. The practical quantity of PCL arms in each H40 were calculated
by comparing the peak area of methyl protons and the peak area of
methylene protons next to the hydroxyl terminus. In addition, the
DP was determined by calculating the ratio of the integral of the
signal of methylene protons next to ester groups and the integral
of the signal of methylene protons next to the hydroxyl terminus.
Then, the molecular weights were calculated by the value of DP and
the quantity of PCL arms in each H40 core. The molar ratio of PCL
arms and H40 end groups (Table 1) is 0.50–0.61, meaning more than half of the hydroxyl
end groups successfully grafted PCL. In addition, the practical DP
of the PCL grafts is close to the targeted DP. The length of PCL arms
is closer to the targeted value with the decrease of DP values. The
calculation accuracy decreased when the DP increased because of the
weaker signal of the methylene protons next to the hydroxyl terminus.
Besides, molecular weights were also determined by gel permeation
chromatography (GPC). The different structures between hyperbranched
and linear polymers led to results deviations from 1H NMR
data. Polymer dispersity was shown by GPC data, which increased with
the increase of molecular weights.

Figure 1 1H NMR spectra of (a) HPCL20
and (b) HPCL20-M.

The second step in the
synthesis was methacrylation in order to transform hydroxyls to methacrylate
moieties. As shown in Figure 1b, the signals at about 6.12 and 5.57 ppm correspond to protons
on double bonds. The small signals appear at about 1.91 ppm attributed
to methyl protons. The result of the 1H NMR spectrum demonstrates
that methacrylate groups were grown onto HPCL20 successfully. The
amount of methacrylate moieties could be calculated by comparing the
signal area of methyl protons in methacrylate moieties and the signal
area of methyl protons in H40. In addition, the results show that
about half hydroxyls were transformed to methacrylate moieties (Table 1).

2.2 Shear Viscosity
Viscosity is a key factor for UV-curable
systems because of its direct effects on leveling properties and coating
methods. Generally, the viscosity of UV-curable systems is determined
by the oligomer, which is mainly related to segment density of polymer,
intermolecular chain entanglement, and hydrogen bonding interactions.
The tests need to be performed while HPCLn-M are
in a molten state in order to determine the bulk viscosity. The melting
temperature was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
As shown in Table 2, the melting temperature of HPCLn-M was 50.3–60.6
°C. Thus, 70 °C was chosen as the test temperature at which
point HPCLn-M could be completely melted. Figure 2 shows the typical
plots of viscosity as a function of shear rate. At the same shear
rate, the shear viscosity increases with the increase of the molecular
weight because linear arms provided chain entanglement and interactions.
All polymers show shear thinning behavior. H40 shows low viscosity
and weak shear thinning because of its three-dimensional spherical
structure. Polymers with longer PCL grafts exhibit more significant
shear thinning when the shear rates increased, which indicates more
physical entanglements and wider molecular weight distribution in
these systems. At low shear rates, the entanglement and disentanglement
were in dynamic equilibrium, showing a basically constant viscosity.
Macromolecules were in a highly entangled network structure at this
period, so the shear stress and viscosity were high. At high shear
rates, the rate of disentanglement of the molecular chains was greater
than the rate of entanglement, resulting in less molecular chains
entangled structure. PCL grafts were oriented in the direction of
flow. When the shear rate was higher, the degree of orientation became
higher, exhibiting the lower shear stress and lower viscosity. Polymers
with longer PCL arms underwent more orientation at high shear rates,
thus showing more pronounced shear thinning. The low melting temperature
and viscosity show the potential for HPCLn-M to be
used in high solids or even powder coatings.

as a function of shear rate at 70 °C.

2.3 DSC Analysis
DSC tests were executed to determine degree of crystallization
and melting temperature. As shown in Table 2, polymers crystallized to varying degrees
(23–36%) with the increase of the DP of PCL due to the crystallinity
of PCL. The degree of crystallization was calculated by setting 166.5
J/g to the fusion heat of 100% crystallinity.37 With the growth of PCL grafts,
the molecular weight and flexibility of the hyperbranched star polymer
increased, leading to a higher melting temperature (Figure 3).

HPCLn-M.

2.4 Thermal Stability
Thermogravimetric
curves of HPCLn and HPCLn-M are
shown in Figure 4.
The temperature of 10, 50, and 90% weight loss of polymers are listed
in Table 3. All polymers
could stay stable until 250 °C, suggesting a general good thermal
stability. The spherical structure of H40 protected the ester bond
in the inner layer, enabling H40 and H40-M with a little higher thermal
degradation temperature. Flexible PCL grafts were easier to be degraded
than spherical H40. The thermal decomposition curves of HPCLn star polymers are divided into two sections, the degradation
of PCL and H40, obviously shown in Figure 4b, which also implies the successful grafting
of PCL. Methacrylate groups endowed HPCLn with cross-linking
function. Cross-linking occurred during heating, so the thermal stability
of HPCLn-M samples is universally better than HPCLn. The temperature of 50% weight loss of HPCLn-M is higher than HPCLn by about 50 °C, implying
successful methacrylation.

2.5 Properties of HPCLn-M-Cured Films
In this study, PCL was grafted onto H40 to reduce the steric cross-linking
hindrance of hyperbranched polymers. Some coating properties were
determined to evaluate the effectiveness of PCL arms. Cured films
were prepared by polymers HPCLn-M, photo initiators,
and solvent. The mole fraction of H40 was same at 3.0 mol/L, whereas
the length of PCL grafts was different, highlighting the features
of linear grafts. Six kinds of films with the DP of PCL at 0, 10,
15, 20, 25, and 30, respectively, were made. The hardness, adhesion,
acid resistance, and alkali resistance of films were tested. The viscosity
was determined by the results in Figure 2. The results are listed in Table 4. When the length of PCL arms
grew, flexible segments increased and the cross-linking steric hindrance
reduced, facilitating the crosslinking reaction. As a result, remaining
carbon–carbon double bonds reduced and the reaction degree
of cross-linking improved, leading to better hardness, adhesion, acid
resistance, and alkali resistance of films. However, the viscosity
of films increased significantly with the growth of PCL arms. When
the DP of PCL grafts exceeded 20, the hardness, adhesion, and resistance
no longer increased with the growth of PCL arms, but the viscosity
still increased significantly. Thus, HPCL20-M exhibited the best comprehensive
performance in comparison.

To sum up, the abundant functional moieties of H40
brought high reactivity and large cross-linking density, but also
led to unreacted moieties, which had a bad effect on the stability
of cured films. Linear PCL grafts with suitable length could make
up for the shortcomings of films made from H40. Besides, the properties
were affected by the DP of PCL, and the comprehensive performance
reached the best when the DP of PCL was 20.

3 Conclusions
Multiarm star polymers (HPCLn-M) were prepared with a simple procedure and a high yield. H40 was
chosen as the core owing to its low viscosity and high reactivity.
PCL was grafted onto H40 by means of ring-opening polymerization,
and the terminal hydroxyls were substituted by methacrylate groups.

This multiarm star polymer was applied to UV-curable coating. The
effect of H40 and PCL on the coating was explored. H40 could improve
the hardness, adhesion, and viscosity of films because of its three-dimensional
spherical structure and rich functional groups. However, weak acid
resistance and alkali resistance were caused at the same time. PCL
grafts could make up for this shortcoming by increasing the content
of flexible segments and the reaction degree of cross-linking. Moreover,
the performance is affected by the DP of PCL, and the suitable DP
of PCL grafts for the sake of great performance was determined as
20 in this study. HPCLn-M have low melting temperature
and low shear viscosity, reducing the usage of solvent and showing
a potential for powder coating. Thus, this multiarm star polymer could
be an environmentally friendly UV-curable coating, which combines
the advantages of the hyperbranched polymer and linear polymer.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Boltorn
H40 regular purchased from Seebio is the fourth generation of the
hyperbranched polyester and has about 64 hydroxyl end groups per molecule
on average. The theoretical molecular weight of H40 is 7214 g/mol.
H40 was dried at room temperature in a vacuum oven for 24 h before
experiments. Methacrylic anhydride, ε-caprolactone, Sn(Oct)2, and (3-aminopropy)trimethoxysilane were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
ε-Caprolactone was distilled under reduced pressure before experiments.

4.2 Characterization and Instruments
1H NMR and 13C NMR were carried out on an AVANCE III HD
400 spectrometer at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 as the solvent. The molecular weight was determined by GPC
HLC-8320 GPC using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent. The flow rate
was 1 mL/min. Linear polystyrene standards are used as calibrations,
which is a relative measurement method. Rheological properties of
polymers were performed on an AR-G2 rotary rheometer (TA, USA) at
70 °C in the shear rate range of 0.01–200 s–1. 25 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness compression molded sample platens
were prepared using a laboratory hot press at 70 °C under 15
MPa pressure for 15 min. In addition, the gap was adjusted to 1.0
mm. The degree of crystallization and melting temperature were determined
by DSC Pyris 1. Samples (about 7 mg) were heated in N2 atmosphere
from −50 to 150 °C, stayed for 1 min, cooled down to −50
°C, stayed for 1 min, and then heated to 150 °C again. The
heating rate and cooling rate both were 10 °C/min. Thermal stability
was determined via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) Q5000IR. Samples
(approximate 5 mg) were heated from 50 to 600 °C with a heating
rate of 20 °C/min in N2 atmosphere. The hardness of
cured films was determined according to GB/T 6739-2006. Adhesion strength
of cured films was determined according to GB/T 9286-1998. Resistance
to chemical reagents of cured films was determined according to GB/T
1763-79.

4.3 Experimental Methods and Procedures
The synthesis can be divided into two parts: grafting and end-capping.
The graft polymers were obtained by grafting ε-caprolactone
onto hydroxyls end groups. Then, the hydroxyls of PCL were capped
with methacrylate moieties. Five kinds of macromonomers containing
different lengths of PCL grafts were synthesized.

4.4 General Procedure for Grafting PCL onto H40
Taking
the synthesis of HPCL20 as an example according to a previous report,36 the fourth generation H40 (0.800 g, ∼7.10
mmol hydroxyl groups) and dry ε-caprolactone (16.0 g, 142 mmol)
was added to a round-bottomed flask. H40 completely dissolved in ε-caprolactone.
After the temperature raised to 130 °C, a catalytic amount of
Sn(Oct)2 (catalyst/hydroxyl groups = 1/20, n/n) was added. The ring-opening polymerization was
triggered under the protection of N2 (g). The mixture was
stirred for 5 h, turning into viscous liquid. Then, the mixture was
dissolved in THF after cooling down to room temperature. The polymer
was precipitated into a 10-fold mixed solution of cold methanol and
ether (1:1), before dried at 35 °C for 24 h. Finally, 14.0 g
(yield, 83.2 wt %) white crystalline powders were obtained.

1.40 (m, −CH2–CH2–CH2−), 1.27 (s, −CH3).

4.5 General
Procedure for Methacrylation
Methacrylation was performed
according to the previous literature.37 A star-branched polyester HPCL20 (5.00 g, containing 2.00 mmol hydroxyl
end groups) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (15 mL)
in a double-neck round-bottom flask. Triethylamine (0.607 g, 6.00
mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.100 g, 0.82 mmol) were added
to the solution. The flask was equipped with a drying tube filled
with calcium chloride anhydrous and cooled on a water/ice-bath. Then,
methacrylic anhydride (0.617 g, 4.00 mmol) diluted with CH2Cl2 (3 mL) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred
for 3 h under the protection of N2 (g). After further being
diluted with CH2Cl2, the reaction mixture was
precipitated into 10-fold cold ether. At last, the product was dried
at 35 °C for 24 h to give 4.6 g (yield 92 wt %) of white crystalline
powder.

4.6 Preparation of UV-Cured
Film
In order to explore the effect of hyperbranched polymer,
linear polymer and its DP on the properties of the coating, one group
of UV-cured films was made. The group contained six kinds of films
with the DP of PCL at 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30, respectively. The
content of H40 was controlled at the same mole fraction. A certain
concentration of the polymer and 3 wt % of photo initiators were dissolved
in CH2Cl2. The solution was coated on the tinplate
using a coating bar with 30 μm and then exposed to ultraviolet
light at the wavelength of 365 nm, cured several minutes. The distance
between the tinplate and ultraviolet light was 9 cm. The solvent was
evaporated finally.
