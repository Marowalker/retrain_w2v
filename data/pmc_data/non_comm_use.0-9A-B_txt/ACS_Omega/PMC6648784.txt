A novel addition curing ethynyl phenyl
azo phenol-biphenylene resin
(EPABN) was synthesized by introducing ethynylphenyl group into biphenyl
novolac resin (BN) through diazo coupling reaction. Its synthesis
reaction and curing mechanism were also proposed. Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy and 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis
showed that the ethynylphenyl group was successfully linked to the
BN molecular chain. By differential scanning calorimetry analysis,
the curing process of EPABN resin was determined to be 150 °C/2
h + 172 °C/2 h + 203 °C/4 h + 255 °C/4 h + 300 °C/4
h. Gel permeation chromatography and elemental analysis showed that
the introduction of ethynylphenyl group increased the number-average
molecular weight and weight-average molecular weight of EPABN. Thermogravimetric
analysis showed that the EPABN resin synthesized under the obtained
optimum conditions has excellent heat resistance, ablation resistance,
and mechanical properties. Td5 and Td10 of heat resistance
of the cured EPABN resin are 463 and 531 °C, respectively, and
its residual char yield at 700 and 1000 °C is 78.2% and 72.1%,
respectively.

Introduction
Phenolic resin is widely used in adhesives,
laminates, ablative
composites, molding compounds, coatings, foams, and many other fields
due to its heat resistance, flame retardancy, low cost, and higher
char yield.1−6 However, with the rapid development of high-rise buildings, aeronautics,
aerospace, and other special fields, the traditional phenolic resin
can no longer meet the higher requirements of these fields in terms
of material strength, stiffness, heat resistance, and flame retardancy.
Therefore, the research of heat-resistant, higher char yield, highly
flame-retardant new phenolic resin is of great significance.7−10 The heat resistance of phenolic resin can be improved by adding
modifier, which can be roughly divided into inorganic elements,11−13 inorganic nanoparticles,14,15 synthetic organic substances,16−18 natural organic substances,19,20 and composite modification.21,22 New groups such as ethynyl,23−25 allyl,26 and phthalonitrile27,28 can also be introduced into the
phenolic resin to obtain a novel addition curable phenolic resin and
improve the heat resistance of the phenolic resin. Kawamoto11 prepared boron-modified phenolic resin (BPR)
with salicyl alcohol and boric acid. The resin has good thermo-oxidative
stability and mechanical properties. L. Asaro15 obtained a phenolic resin reinforced with carbon black and mesoporous
silica particles (5 and 20 wt %), which increased the glass transition
temperature and mechanical properties of the silica/resin composite.
Wang23 synthesized a novel phenolic resin
with high ethynyl contents by the diazo coupling reaction of phenol
units with 3-ethynylaniline. Most of the modification work is researched
around conventional phenolic resin, but there are few studies on the
modification of the high-performance phenolic resin, especially the
biphenyl novolac resin (BN).29

Biphenyl
novolac resin is a kind of high-performance phenolic resin
that is synthesized by introducing biphenyl group into molecular main
chain through Friedel–Crafts reaction between phenol and diphenyl
dimethyl ether. The introduction of high rigidity biphenyl structure
can greatly reduce the content of phenolic hydroxyl groups in BN resin
and improve its heat resistance, low moisture absorption rate, high
thermal oxygen stability, and high intrinsic flame retardancy.28,30 On the basis of this, BN was synthesized first in our work, and
then ethynylphenyl group was introduced into the biphenyl novolac
molecular chain to obtain a novel addition curing ethynyl phenyl azo
phenol-biphenylene resin (EPABN). To the best of our knowledge, EPABN
resin has been rarely reported. The structure and thermal properties
of EPABN were characterized in this paper. The best curing process
and the optimized synthesis reaction conditions of EPABN were discussed
in detail. The synthesis of EPABN resin and its possible curing mechanism
were also described. This is a new high-performance phenolic resin
with high temperature resistance, higher char yield, and good process
performance, which can be widely used in many fields such as aviation
and aerospace.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of EPABN
The FT-IR spectra of BN and
EPABN samples are shown in Figure 1. It can be seen from the Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra of BN that the 3401 cm–1 peak is
attributed to the −OH stretching vibration on the aromatic
ring, the C–H stretching vibration peak at the aromatic ring
is at 3022 cm–1, and the −CH2–
stretching vibration is at 2907 cm–1. 1454 and 1365
cm–1 are peaks of −CH2–
scissoring vibration. 1593 and 1496 cm–1 correspond
to the peak of C=C stretching vibration of benzene ring. 1238
cm–1 belongs to the peak of C–O stretching
vibration on phenolic hydroxyl group. The absorption peaks at 804
and 754 cm–1 are the out-of-plane bending vibration
absorption peaks of the para- and ortho-disubstituted phenyl C–H
bond on the aromatic ring, respectively.28 These peaks indicate that the synthesized product is BN.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra
of BN and EPABN resin.

Compared with BN, the infrared absorption spectrum of EPABN
is
basically unchanged. Only the sharper and stronger ≡C–H
stretching vibration peak appeared at 3288 cm–1,
and the narrow and weak −C≡C– stretching vibration
peak appeared at 2105 cm–1. The vibration peaks
of 1,2,4,6-tetrasubstituted structure C–H in phenol nucleus
appeared at 898 cm–1, and the ≡C–H
out-of-plane deformation peak of alkyne appears near 638 cm–1. Strong out-of-plane bending vibration peaks of benzene ring 1,3-disubstituted
C–H appeared at 798 and 691 cm–1. The presence
of these peaks indicates that the ethynylphenyl group has been successfully
linked to the BN molecular chain.

The 1H NMR spectra
of the BN and EPABN samples are shown
in Figure 2 (standardized
against tetramethylsilane (TMS)). Figure 2a is a 1H NMR spectrum of BN,
in which proton peaks from 9.6 to 9.3 ppm are attributed to internally
associated phenolic hydroxyl hydrogen. Peaks from 7.6 to 7.1 ppm and
from 7.1 to 6.8 ppm correspond to proton peaks of the unsubstituted
hydrogen on biphenyl groups and phenol nuclear benzene rings, respectively.
Peak from 4.05 to 3.75 ppm is the proton peak of methylene hydrogen.
Because of the presence of isomers, the proton peak of methylene hydrogen
splits into six peaks. The peak appearing around 3.4 is the proton
peak of impurity water, and the peak at 2.5 is solvent dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) peak.23,31Figure 2b shows the 1H NMR spectrum of
EPABN. Compared with Figure 2a, the hydrogen proton peak of the associated phenolic hydroxy
group, the hydrogen proton peak, and the methylene hydrogen proton
peak of the aryl ring were shifted to 10.9, 8.1, to 6.8, and 4.1 to
3.8 ppm, respectively. An acetylene hydrogen proton peak appeared
at 4.1–4.4 ppm, confirming that ethynylphenyl group was successfully
introduced into the resin’s molecular chain structure. In addition,
the peaks of hydrogen proton peaks on the aromatic rings in the characteristic
absorption peak of EPABN are relatively weak. This
may be due to the introduction of ethynylphenyl group, making the
molecular structure rigid, leading to its solubility in DMSO being
not good.

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra of (a) BN and (b) EPABN resin (DMSO,
TMS standard).

The gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) profiles of BN and EPABN
samples are shown in Figure 3 (polystyrene (PS)
standard). The profiles of the GPC curves of the BN and EPABN samples
are similar, indicating that they have similar molecular weight distribution
characteristics. However, the retention time corresponding to the
middle peak position in the GPC curve of the EPABN sample became short,
so that the number-average molecular weight and viscosity became large.
Typical parameters of GPC curves for BN and EPABN samples are given
in Table 1. We can
see that the introduction of ethynylphenyl group increases the number-average
molecular weight and weight-average molecular weight of EPABN, but
the polydispersity becomes smaller, and the molecular weight distribution
is more concentrated.

Analysis on Curing Process of EPABN
The EPABN resin
is obtained by a coupling reaction between ethynylphenyl diazonium
salt and BN, and it has an addition-curable reactive functional group
in its molecular chain. This type of phenolic resin can be self-cured
by thermal addition polymerization of acetylene groups at a certain
temperature without the need of an external curing agent and a catalyst
to obtain a cured product having excellent heat resistance. The curing
process parameters can be obtained by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) analysis.

From the DSC curve of EPABN at different heating
rates given in Figure 4, the EPABN resin is a single peak cure. As the heating rate increases,
its peak shape gradually broadens and high, and the peak temperature
also becomes larger. When the heating rate is 5 °C/min, the peak
temperature is the lowest at ∼211 °C. The peak shape is
the narrowest and the lowest. The reaction exothermic temperature
range is 150–260 °C. The exotherm is gentle, and the curing
reaction is easy to control. When the heating rate is 20 °C/min,
the maximum peak temperature is ∼250 °C; the exothermic
heat of the curing reaction becomes larger, but its peak shape is
the widest, indicating that the EPABN curing reaction is still easy
to control.

Figure 4 DSC curves of EPABN at different heating rates (N2).

The characteristic temperature
of curing reaction of EPABN at different
heating rates is shown in Table 2. As the heating rate increases, the initial curing
reaction temperature (Ti), peak top temperature
(Tp), and termination temperature (Tf) of EPABN increase. This is because, at a
lower heating rate, the heat flow rate dH/dt is smaller; that is, the thermal effect of unit time is
small. Thus, the curing rate is small, and the system has enough time
for curing reaction, so its Ti is lower.
As the heating rate increases, the dH/dt and curing rate increase, resulting in a corresponding increase
in the temperature difference, and the exothermic peak of the curing
reaction will correspondingly shift toward the higher temperature.
According to the DSC curve, it can be roughly determined that the
curing process of the EPABN resin is 150 °C/2 h + 172 °C/2
h + 203 °C/4 h + 255 °C/4 h + 300 °C/4 h.

Optimization
of Synthesis Reaction Conditions of EPABN
The Mass Ratio of Different
3-Aminophenylacetylene to BN
With ethyl alcohol absolute
as the solvent, the molar ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene
to NaOH was 1:2.07. The GPC curves and N content of EPABN resins prepared
from different 3-aminophenylacetylene to BN mass ratios are shown
in Figure 5 and Table 3. The profile of the
GPC curves of EPABN samples prepared with different 3-aminophenylacetylene
and BN mass ratios are very similar, indicating that they have very
similar molecular weight distribution characteristics. Table 3 shows the typical parameters
of the GPC curve. As the mass ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene to BN
increases, the number-average molecular weight, weight-average molecular
weight, polydispersity, and N content of EPABN increase slightly.
The larger the mass ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene to BN, the greater
the amount of 3-aminobenzeneacetylene involved in the diazo reaction
and the more acetylene diazonium salt positive ions available as electrophiles.
The greater the chance of electrophilic substitution on the aromatic
ring with biphenyl novolac, the higher the diazo coupling rate, the
higher the N content in the EPABN molecule, the larger the molecular
weight and the polydispersity.

mass ratios of 3-aminophenylacetylene
to BN (THF eluent, PS standard).

Different
Molar Ratios of 3-Aminophenylacetylene to NaOH
With ethyl
alcohol absolute as solvent, the mass ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene
to BN was 1.25:1. The GPC and N contents of EPABN resins prepared
from different molar ratios of 3-aminophenylacetylene to NaOH are
shown in Table 4. As
the molar ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene to NaOH increases, the number-average
molecular weight and weight-average molecular weight of EPABN increase,
and the molecular weight distribution coefficient first decreases
and then increases. But the N content in EPABN molecules gradually
decreases. When the molar ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene to NaOH
is 1:1.09, the N content of EPABN is the highest, but the number-average
molecular weight is very low at only 200. EPABN resin has lower intrinsic
viscosity and poor heat resistance. When the molar ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene
to NaOH is 1:1.73, the N content in EPABN molecule is 8.93 wt %, the
lowest molecular weight distribution coefficient is only 1.25, and
the molecular weight distribution is more concentrated. At this time,
EPABN resin has better heat resistance. When the molar ratio of m-aminophenylacetylene to NaOH is greater than 1:1.73, the
molecular weight of EPABN is larger, but the N content is smaller;
the active acetylene group, which can be used for thermal addition
curing, is less, so the heat resistance is poor. In general, the coupling
reaction of a diazonium salt with a phenolic aldehyde is performed
in a system having a pH of 8–10. The content of NaOH is small,
the pH value is too low, the concentration of phenolic sodium salt
on the phenol ring in the molecular structure of BN is too low, and
the coupling reaction is incomplete. When the NaOH content is high
and the pH is too high, diazo anions are easily formed, which is unfavorable
to the coupling reaction, and the diazo coupling ratio is low, so
the N content in the EPABN molecule is small.

Different Solvent Systems
The mass
ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene
to BN is 1.25:1, and the molar ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene to
NaOH is 1:1.73. The GPC and N contents of EPABN resin prepared from
different solvent systems are shown in Figure 6 and Table 5. It can be seen from Figure 6 that the profiles of the GPC curves of the
EPABN samples prepared with different solvent systems are very similar,
indicating that they have very similar molecular weight distribution
characteristics. As the water content in the solvent system increases,
the number-average molecular weight, weight-average molecular weight,
and polydispersity of EPABN increase first and then decrease, while
the N content in the EPABN molecule continuously increases. When the
solvent system used is absolute ethanol, the number-average molecular
weight, weight-average molecular weight, and N content of EPABN are
the smallest, but the molecular weight distribution is relatively
concentrated. When the volume ratio of anhydrous ethanol to water
in the solvent system is 2:1, the N content in the EPABAN is up to
9.53 wt %. The number-average molecular weight and molecular weight
distribution are also relatively moderate. At this time, EPABN has
excellent heat resistance. This is because the coupling reaction between
diazonium salts and phenols is usually performed in weakly basic aqueous
solution, but the solubility of basic aqueous solution to some phenols
with larger steric hindrance is poor. Therefore, the concentration
of the generated phenol oxygen ions is too low, and the coupling reaction
does not easily proceed. At this point, adding an alkaline substance
such as ethanol or pyridine as a catalyst can accelerate the coupling
reaction and increase the diazo coupling rate. However, when the selected
solvent system is an anhydrous organic solvent, the solubility of
NaOH and phenols deteriorates, and the diazo coupling rate becomes
lower. The solvent water molecules can also act as catalysts to accelerate
the reaction.

EPABN Resins Prepared from
Different 3-Aminophenylacetylene
and NaOH Molar Ratios
The TGA curves of EPABN resin-cured
products prepared from different 3-aminophenylacetylene and NaOH molar
ratios are shown in Figure 7, and the typical parameters of the TG curves are shown in Table 6. With the increase
of the molar ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene to NaOH, the Td5, Td10, char residue at 700 and 1000 °C of the cured
EPABN resin first increased and then decreased. When the molar ratio
of 3-aminophenylacetylene to NaOH is 1:1.09, the Td5, Td10, char residues at 700 and 1000 °C of the cured EPABN resin
are the lowest, and the thermal performance is poor. When the molar
ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene to NaOH is 1:1.73, char residues at
700 and 1000 °C of the cured EPABN resin are the highest, which
are 76.1% and 70.1%, respectively. When the molar ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene
to NaOH is 1:2.07, the cured EPABN resins Td5 and Td10 reach
the highest, but the residual char rate is lower. Combined with GPC
and elemental analysis of EPABN, it was found that EPABN resin prepared
from a molar ratio of 3-aminophenylacetylene to NaOH of 1:1.73 has
excellent thermal properties.

EPABN
Resin Prepared from Different Solvent Systems
The TG curves
of the cured EPABN resin prepared from different solvent
systems are shown in Figure 8, and the typical parameters of the TG curves are shown in Table 7. The Td5, Td10, char residues at 700 and 1000 °C of the cured EPABN resin
gradually increase with the increase of the water content of the solvent
system. When the solvent system used was two-thirds ethanol and one-third
water (v/v), the Td5, Td10, char residues at 700 and 1000
°C of the cured EPABN resin reached the highest, 463 °C,
531 °C, 78.2%, and 72.1%, respectively. Combined with GPC and
elemental analysis of EPABN, it can be seen that the N content of
EPABN molecules synthesized under this condition is the highest, indicating
that the content of active alkyne groups in the resin molecular structure
is the highest. The heat-polymerization of alkyne groups increases
the cross-link density of the cured EPABN resin, which greatly improves
the heat resistance and ablation resistance of EPABN resins.

Resin Synthesis Reaction and Curing Mechanism
The EPABN
resin is obtained by using BN as raw material and introducing ethynylphenyl
group into the molecular chain through a diazo coupling reaction.
The reaction mechanism and curing mechanism are as follows:(1) The BN is a special
phenolic resin
prepared by Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction under the action
of an acidic catalyst with excess phenol and 4,4′-dichloromethylbiphenyl.
The reaction mechanism is shown in Scheme 1. Under acidic condition, 4,4′-dichloromethyl
biphenyl reacted with H+ to form 4,4′-dimethylpositive
ion biphenyl, then it attacked the ortho and para position with higher
electron cloud density in phenol structure as electrophilic reagent
to form intermediate S-complex and lost one proton to obtain electrophilic
substitution product. The obtained electrophilic substitution product
can also be subjected to Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction
with 4,4′-dichloromethyl biphenyl, and the reaction is repeated
so as to finally generate BN oligomer.

(2) EPABN is a novel addition-cure phenolic
resin prepared by a diazo coupling reaction between a BN and 3-aminophenylacetylene.
The reaction mechanism is shown in Scheme 2. Under acidic conditions, sodium nitrite
reacts with H+ to form HNO2 and acts on 3-aminophenylacetylene
to convert it into a positively charged ethynylphenyl diazo hydrochloride.
Biphenyl novolac molecular chains contain a large number of phenol
structures, and the ortho and para electron clouds of phenol are dense.
At a pH of 8–9, ethynylphenyl diazo hydrochloride can act as
an electrophile to attack carbon atoms with a higher density of electron
clouds, form intermediate products, lose hydrogen protons, and finally
obtain EPABN resin. Because of the influence of steric hindrance,
diazonium ions generally attack the para position, and if the para
position is occupied, they will attack the ortho-position site.

(3) EPABN resin is mainly
self-cured by
thermal addition polymerization of ethynyl groups in the molecular
chain. The ethynyl groups in the resin may be converted into benzene
rings, aromatic rings, multiolefins, trimers, tetramers, conjugated
olefins, etc. by trimerization reaction, Glazer coupling reaction,
Strauss coupling reaction, Diels–Alder reaction, or addition
polymerization reaction. The possible curing mechanism is shown in Scheme 3.

Conclusion
In
conclusion, EPABN resin was successfully synthesized by diazo
coupling reaction in this experiment. Compared with conventional high-performance
phenolic resins, this is a new type of addition-curing resin in which
the former needs to be cured under the action of a curing agent or
a catalyst, and the latter requires only heating to be cured. The
introduction of ethynylphenyl group increases the number-average and
weight-average molecular weights of the resin and improves the heat
resistance of the resin. The high-rigidity biphenyl structure in the
molecular chain can greatly reduce the phenolic hydroxyl content in
the BN resin and improve its heat resistance. Therefore, Td5 and Td10 of heat resistance of the EPABN resin synthesized under the optimum
conditions are 463 and 531 °C, respectively, and its residual
char yields at 700 and 1000 °C are 78.2% and 72.1%, respectively.
The cured EPABN has excellent heat resistance, ablation resistance,
and mechanical properties, which can be widely used in aerospace and
aviation as ablative materials and thermal structural materials.

measured at room temperature with TMS as internal standard by means
of nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (Avance III 400 MHz). The
E2695 GPC was used to measure the molecular weight size and distribution
of the product. The sample was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF)
solvent and eluted with THF at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The concentrations
of the samples were 0.6 wt %. The standard sample was monodisperse
polystyrene. The organic element analyzer (Vanio EL CHNS) was used
to analyze the type and content of the elements contained in the sample.
The DSC analysis (STA449C synchronous thermal analyzer) uses N2 as the protective atmosphere; the flow rate is 60 mL/min,
the heating rate is 5 °C/min, 10 °C/min, 15 °C/min,
20 °C/min, and the test temperature range is 20–350 °C.
The SDTQ600 thermogravimetry differential thermal analyzer was used
for thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; test temperature range of 20–1000
°C, N2). The flow rate was 60 mL/min, and the heating
rate was 10 °C/min.
