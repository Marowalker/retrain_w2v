One of the main approaches
for contact angle determination using
sessile drops with a missing apex (e.g., because of the presence of
the needle tip) is the polynomial drop-profile fitting method. The
major disadvantage of this fitting procedure is that the derived contact
angle is highly sensitive to the polynomial order and the number of
pixels involved in the actual fit. In the present work, an easily
implementable method is introduced to effectively tackle these drawbacks.
Instead of fitting the drop-profile itself, the polynomial fitting
is applied to the difference between the drop profile and the circumcircle,
independently for both sides of the drop. The derivative value of
this difference at the contact point is used to correct the slope
obtained analytically from the circumcircle. It is shown that this
approach allows the robust determination of the contact angle with
high (≤0.6°) accuracy in a straightforward manner, and
the results are not affected by the actual contact angle, drop volume,
or the resolution of the captured image. Validation of this new approach
is also given in the contact angle range of 20°–150°
by comparing the results to the values calculated by the Young–Laplace
fit.

1 Introduction
The determination of the
contact angle formed along the solid–liquid–vapor
contact line is an important surface characterization tool in research
and in several fields of industry because of its relative simplicity
and high sensitivity. The most convenient and popular method of this
family is the sessile droplet method. Advancing and receding contact
angles can be measured stepwise by changing the drop volume, i.e.,
by the drop build-up method.1,2 The major limitation
of this technique is that very low contact angles cannot be determined
accurately.3 The accuracy of contact angle
measurements using sessile drops was improved drastically by the introduction
of the axisymmetric drop shape analysis (ADSA)4 compared to the former simple and subjective alignment of the tangent
of the drop profile at the contact point. In ADSA or latter in ADSA-P
(ADSA-profile),5 the numerical solution
of the Young–Laplace equation is fitted to the captured axisymmetric
drop profile, knowing the physical properties of the test liquid.
A basically different approach is the theoretical image fitting analysis
(TIFA). In this method, the theoretical two-dimensional image is fitted
to the captured image of the sessile or pendant drop6 instead of the theoretical one-dimensional curve of ADSA;
therefore, the need of edge detection is avoided. However, both approaches
had limitations: the drop must be axisymmetric and the drop’s
apex must be visible in the image. Therefore, these methods cannot
be applied in tilted plate or needle-in-drop experiments. Additionally,
dynamic contact angles could be measured only by changing the drop
volume through a hole of the sample. This latter limitation led to
the latest sophisticated developments of both methods. TIFA–axisymmetric
interfaces (TIFA–AI)7 and ADSA-no
apex (ADSA-NA)8 can overcome the need of
the apex. The major achievements of the consecutive generations of
these methods can be overviewed in detail in the valuable review of
Saad and Neumann.9

In order to overcome
the limitation imposed by assumption of an
axisymmetric shape, the high-precision drop shape analysis was introduced
for evaluation of tilted plate experiments in 2013 by Schmitt and
Heib.10 Their method identifies the drop
profile and the baseline with subpixel resolution and analyzes the
left and right parts of the profile independently; therefore, even
strongly asymmetric drops can be evaluated. The method was extended
later to determine dynamic contact angles also on horizontal surfaces.11 One of the unique aspects of this technique
is the statistical approach applied during data evaluation, as the
Gompertzian function is fitted to the contact angle as a function
of the tilt angle or the volume change for horizontal surfaces. The
individual data are averaged leading to an averaged overall Gompertzian
function, which provides objective and reliable data.12 The latest developments of this approach have been reviewed
recently.13

Several further approaches
were developed for drop shape analysis.
One ellipse14 or two circles with the same
tangent at the apex15 can be fitted to
the whole projection of the drop or to the left and right arcs separated
by the apex, respectively. Double-sided elliptical fitting16 and cubic spline-based drop shape analysis17 were also implemented and investigated. The
accuracy of these approaches were investigated in statistical comparison,
and it was found that it strongly depends on the drop volume and on
the contact angle range.18 Furthermore,
the fitted curve does not pass necessarily through the contact point
where the contact angle should be determined. The “drop snake”
method based on spline interpolation is not able to evaluate images
with the needle immersed in the drop.

Besides these methods,
the polynomial fitting approach remained
definitely popular because of its general usability and simplicity.
However, it suffers from known drawbacks. The resultant contact angles
are sensitive to the polynomial order and the number of pixel points
to which the polynomial is fitted.19,20 Various strategies
have been followed to overcome these uncertainties and to improve
the accuracy. One straightforward approach was to introduce the subpixel
resolution of the profile using a sigmoid model21 or cubic spline fitting5,8 to the pixel
intensity. Further improvement could be achieved based on the subpixel
resolution by identification of the contact points as the intersection
of the extrapolated drop profile and the baseline21 or as the intersection of the profile and its reflection.8 Atefi et al. showed that only one single polynomial
order or a definite (predefined) number of pixels cannot result in
accurate contact angles even in the case of the applied subpixel resolution.22 Their differentiator mask chooses the polynomial
order that has the longest stable contact angle regime as a function
of the number of pixels. This method has an accuracy of <0.4°
for contact angles below 60°. For larger values, the polynomial
fitting in polar coordinates was introduced. The origin is translated
to the apex first, and the coordinates of the profile are transformed
from Cartesian to polar coordinates. Therefore, the slope of the boundary
at the contact point is low for large contact angles. It results in
the accuracy of <1° in the 40°–170° contact
angle range. Unfortunately, the necessity of the apex appears here
again; therefore, this approach is not appropriate for needle-in measurements.

In this work, an easily implementable and especially a robust method
is introduced to determine contact angles in no-apex situations, that
is, when the top part of the drop is not available for the image analysis
procedure. The proposed approach combines the advantages of circular
and polynomial fit concepts, while their uncertainties are suppressed.
Circumscribed circles are constructed independently for the left and
right undisturbed parts of the drop profile—which are not affected
by the needle. The difference between the circumcircle and the captured
profile is determined, and a polynomial is fitted to this difference.
It has to be emphasized that because this small difference (<10
pixels) is fitted instead of the drop profile, the slope of the fitted
curve does not change significantly with the actual value of the contact
angle. Therefore, the uncertainty from this component is also much
lower. This approach has further advantages. It is an inherent property
of the circumcircle that the arc passes exactly through the contact
point, and its derivative can be calculated analytically. Furthermore,
the method enables fast evaluation compared to, for example, numerical
integration of the Laplace equation.

Hence, the proposed method
can be useful in dynamic contact angle
measurements23 and in captive bubble experiments
on hydrophilic samples or in sessile drop measurements on hydrophobic
surfaces with low contact angle hysteresis, i.e., when the needle
is necessary—or it is convenient—to hold the bubble
or the drop in the right place. The evaluation of electrowetting24 and electrodewetting25 experiments can be also carried out with higher accuracy.

2 Concept of the Method
The popularity of polynomial
fitting remains unchanged in cases
where the Young–Laplace fit cannot be applied. The uncertainty
of the polynomial approach originates from two different factors,
as it was written above. The major problem is that the appropriate
polynomial order depends on the contact angle range. The other drawback
is the sensitivity to the number of data points, i.e., the number
of pixels.

The proposed, easily implementable method was developed
to overcome
these uncertainties. The key step is that two circumscribed circles
are constructed for the two undisturbed parts of the drop profile.
These two parts are evaluated independently (Figure 1). The circumcircle passes through the three-phase
contact point, the other endpoint of the profile’s part, and
the point that is selected on the profile at the half of the maximum
height. The center and the radius of the circumcircle can be determined
easily using coordinate geometry. The derivative at the contact point
can be calculated analytically 1  where R is the radius of
the circumcircle, and xO and xCP are the abscissa of the center of the circumcircle
and the abscissa of the contact point, respectively.

Figure 1 Schematics of the circumcircle
and the difference fitting method.
The region of the profile is intentionally omitted, which is affected
by the needle. Three points are selected from each resultant arc:
the endpoints and the point at the half of the maximum height. Circumscribed
circles that pass through these points are constructed independently,
and the polynomial is fitted to the difference between the circle
and the profile as a function of the lateral distance (x) from the contact point (x = 0).

A polynomial can be fitted to the difference between the
circumcircle
and the real drop profile as a function of the lateral distance (x) from the contact point (x = 0). This
difference is quite small for low-volume droplets but it becomes larger
for larger drops when the gravitational effect cannot be neglected.
The effect of gravity is negligible when the Bond number is small:
Bo = g·a2·Δρ/γ
≪ 1, where g is the gravitational acceleration, a is the radius of the meniscus curvature, Δρ
is the difference in mass densities of the two fluids, and γ
is the interfacial (surface) tension. The sixth-order polynomial was
proved to be appropriate for all investigated contact angles and drop
volumes. The derivative of this polynomial at the contact point gives
a correction to the slope calculated for the circumcircle. Therefore,
the contact angle value is calculated according to the following equation 2  where ycircumcircle and ypolynomial are the equations of
the respective parts of the circumcircle and the polynomial, respectively.

3 Materials
In this work, ultrapure water (purified by
a Millipore Milli-Q
integral system, surface tension γ = 72.25 mN/m at 24 °C)
with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was used as the test liquid
for all contact angle measurements.

Several different surfaces
were selected for the validation based
on their water contact angle. Microscope glass cover slides (Menzel-Gläser)
were successively cleaned by 5 min ultrasonication in acetone, ethanol,
and ultrapure water, and dried under gentle filtered nitrogen flow
(henceforth: glass). A stoichiometric silicon nitride was deposited
on (100) silicon substrates by chemical vapor deposition in our cleanroom
facility, and it was used as received (henceforth: Si3N4). Thermal silicon dioxide was grown on the (100) silicon
surface in our cleanroom facility, and it was used as received (henceforth:
SiO2). The electron-beam evaporated gold film was prepared
on the (100) silicon substrate, and the gold surface was modified
by incubation in 1 mM aqueous solution of cysteamine molecules for
30 min followed by rinsing with ultrapure water (henceforth: Au-cys).
An hexagonal closed-packed spherical nanovoid array prepared as in
ref (26) was coated
with a gold thin film by electron-beam evaporation (henceforth: Au-void).
Microscope glass cover slides (Menzel-Gläser) were coated with
a cyclo olefin polymer (Zeonex 480R) by spin-coating at 2000 rpm from
a 5 wt % toluene solution (henceforth: Zeonex). A roughened polytetrafluoroethylene
sheet was cleaned by rinsing with ethanol and ultrapure water and
dried under filtered nitrogen flow (henceforth: rough polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE).

A laboratory-built apparatus was used for the contact
angle measurements;
its detailed description can be found in ref (27). The images of the drops
were captured by using a Basler acA1300-200 μm complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera with a resolution of 1280
× 1024 pixels and with the frame rate of 175 fps using an imaging
optics (Navitar Zoom 6000) mounted on a tiltable stage. The measurements
were carried out in a closed sample chamber at 24 ± 0.5 °C
and 92 ± 0.5% relative humidity.

4 Methods
4.1 Validation
Sessile droplets were
used for the validation procedure. Advancing and receding contact
angles28 of sessile drops of ultrapure
water were determined on the selected surfaces by the drop build-up
technique. The volume of the sessile droplets was increased and decreased
in 2 μL steps using a gastight microliter syringe (Hamilton
Company; needle diameter: 0.718 mm). The maximum volume of the droplets
was 20 or 30 μL depending on the actual contact angle. The needle
of the syringe was approached to the drop and retracted from the droplet
with a velocity of 0.125 mm/s using a vertical actuator.

The
images of the drops were captured in such a way that the needle was
not retracted completely from the field of view; it can be seen in
the top part of the image. Therefore, the scaling factor and the needle’s
position can be automatically determined by a simple algorithm for
every image knowing the diameter of the needle. The Sobel algorithm29 was applied to find edges in the images. Further
evaluations were carried out with pixel resolution. An algorithm finds
the drop apex and the contact points without extrapolation, as in
the standard ADSA.4 These three points
are necessary for the solution of the Young–Laplace equation,
which was fitted to the profile using the same algorithm as in ref (30). The results for low-volume
droplets with a small base diameter were omitted because of the drop
size effect.31−33

The same images were evaluated by the developed
method (Figure 2).
It was observed
that the steel needle affects the profile of a water droplet in a
lateral region with an extent of less than double of the needle diameter.
Therefore, the upper part of the determined profile with this lateral
size was intentionally deleted by the program around the needle position.
The size of this window can be easily changed for other test liquids.
Circumcircles were constructed independently for the two resultant
arcs and sixth-order polynomials was fitted to the vertical difference
between the circumcircle and the captured profile. Note, that the
arcs were rotated 90° in the case of large contact angles. The
sum of the slope of the circumcircle and the polynomial at the contact
point was used to calculate the left and right contact angle. The
mean of these values was compared to the result of the Young–Laplace
fit.

Figure 2 Schematic of the validation procedure. (a) The image of the droplet
is captured, and (b) edges are determined by the Sobel algorithm.
(c) This profile is evaluated by the Young–Laplace fit using
the contact points (blue crosses), and the apex (red cross) is identified
by an algorithm. The result is shown by the green curve. (d) The region
in the same profile, which would be affected by the needle, is omitted.
(e) Circumcircles passing through each three points (red and blue
crosses for the left and right arc) are constructed independently.
Sixth-order polynomial is fitted to the difference between the circle
and the profile. The green curves show the finally obtained drop profile.

After the analysis, all images were downsized to
750 × 600
pixels using the IrfanView software, and the whole procedure was repeated
in order to investigate the robustness of the method for lower resolution
images.

4.2 Needle-in-Drop Measurements
Needle-in-drop
measurements were carried out on the SiO2 surface to demonstrate
the capability of the method. Two different syringes with needle diameters
of 0.718 and 0.235 mm were used for liquid dosing. The drop volume
was changed stepwise in 2 μL increments and decrements, as previously,
but the needle was left in the droplet. Images were captured after
every dispensing step; therefore, the contact line was not moving
continuously to ensure the comparability with the results of validation.

5 Results and Discussion
5.1 Validation
In general, the difference
between the circumcircle and the real profile becomes larger with
the the increasing drop volume because of the emerging role of gravity.
The deviation from the circle shape is more significant also for droplets
with larger vertical dimension, that is, for larger contact angles.
A typical difference curve can be seen in Figure 3a for the left arc of a 20 μL of the
water droplet measured on the glass surface. Figure 3b shows the same curve for a 10 μL
of droplet on the rough PTFE surface. The difference is larger in
the latter case, although the volume is only the half. The zig-zag
character of the data points originates from that of the drop profile
having pixel resolution, while the circumcircle is a continuous curve.
Presumably, the accuracy of the method can be improved further using
subpixel resolution implementing the above mentioned models10,21 or a recently developed algorithm by Trujillo-Pino et al.34 The solid line represents the sixth-order polynomial
fitted to the data points. In general, the R2 values of the fits depend on the number of pixels in an arc.
These values are in the range of 0.940–0.998 for high resolution
images depending on the droplet volume and the contact angle, while
they are typically larger than 0.9 in the case of low resolution.

Figure 3 Difference
between the left arc of the profile and its circumcircle
as a function of the distance from the contact point (a) for the glass
(20 μL) and (b) for the rough PTFE (10 μL) surface. Sixth-order
polynomials (red curves) were fitted to the data points. The insets
show the images of the evaluated droplets. The zig-zag character of
the data points originated from that pixel resolution was applied.

The most important advantage of this method can
be also observed
in Figure 3. The maximum
absolute value of the difference does not exceed 10 pixels even in
case of large 30 μL drops on hydrophobic surfaces, and it remains
below 5 pixels in the most cases. Therefore, the slope of the polynomial
is much lower at the contact point (x = 0) than the
original drop profile has. Furthermore, the slope of the fitted curve
does not change significantly with the actual value of the contact
angle. This results in the robustness of the method.

The left
and right circumcircles are constructed independently;
therefore, contact angles are calculated for the left and the right
contact point (which enables to evaluate also nonaxisymmetric drops). Figure 4a shows the determined
water contact angles as a function of the drop’s base diameter
measured on the SiO2 surface for the high resolution images.
The left and right contact angles have small deviations even for large
drop volumes; their mean values are close to the results of the Young–Laplace
fit.

diameter on the SiO2 surface. Hollow triangles designate
the left and right contact angles resulted by the present method for
the resolution of (a) 1280 × 1024 and (b) 750 × 600. The
results of the Young–Laplace fit are designated by circles.
The upper scale shows the number of pixels in one arc.

The average advancing contact angle was determined to be
62.3°
± 0.2° with the Young–Laplace fit and 62.1°
± 0.2° with the present method. The differences between
the receding contact angles were found to be also small: 55.5°
± 0.1° and 55.6° ± 0.2°, respectively. The
same results can be seen in Figure 4b for low resolution. The differences between the left
and right contact angles are slightly larger as well as the difference
between the averaged values. The advancing contact angles are 62.4°
± 0.3° and 62.1° ± 0.4°, while the receding
contact angles are 55.7° ± 0.2° and 55.5° ±
0.3° with the classic and proposed method, respectively. Also,
the standard deviations are a bit larger for the low-resolution images.
These differences and deviations are very small compared to the sensitivity
of the polynomial approach to the number of pixel points. The number
of pixels in one arc is shown in the upper axis. The experimentally
investigated range was ca. 100–250 pixels for this sample.
The contact angle determined by the sixth-order polynomial fit decreases
from ca. 65° to 61° in this range of number of pixels.22

The results of the validation procedure
are summarized in Table 1 for stable advancing
and receding contact angles measured on various surfaces. The evaluation
was carried out as described above. The contact angles were averaged
for the advancing and the receding phase, and the mean values and
their standard deviations were collected and compared. The differences
in the mean values are typically not larger than 0.5° for high
resolution images; it reaches the absolute value of 0.7° only
in the case of the rough PTFE. Note that the standard deviation of
the receding contact angle on this surface is 1.4°. For low resolution
images, the differences between the mean values and the standard deviations
are something larger. The differences do not exceed the absolute value
of 0.6 in these cases.

measured on the rough PTFE surface were not plotted for better visibility.
The contact line pins strongly on the surface of the Au-void sample;
therefore, its receding contact angle is changing continuously. Hence
it is missing from Table 1. Besides, this surface was selected to verify that the method
gives reliable results also between the stable contact angles down
to 22.3°.

filled markers. The hollow markers designate the values determined
by the proposed circumcircle and differential fitting. The insets
show droplet images corresponding to the marked points. The contact
line pinning on the gold nanovoid surface is obvious.

5.2 Needle-in-Drop Measurements
Needle-in-drop
measurements were carried out on the SiO2 sample for demonstrating
the capability of the present method. Two syringes were applied with
different needle diameters (0.718 and 0.235 mm) for dispensing the
test liquid. The mean values of left and right contact angles were
plotted as a function of the drop’s base diameter in Figure 6 for both syringes.
The advancing and receding contact angles were determined to be 63.3°
± 0.4° and 55.1° ± 0.3°, respectively, for
the needle of larger diameter, while 62.6° ± 0.4° and
55.1° ± 0.5° were found for the syringe with the small
diameter needle. These results are in good agreement considering their
standard deviation. During the validation, the advancing and receding
contact angles were calculated to be 62.3° ± 0.2° and
55.6° ± 0.1°, respectively, using the Young–Laplace
fit. The results obtained using the small-diameter needle are a bit
closer to these values, although the slightly larger standard deviations
and hysteresis values of the needle-in measurements can refer also
to some amount of surface contamination. Evaluated drop profiles are
shown in Figure 7.
It can be observed in Figure 7d–f that the needle is not centered to the droplet.
It was caused by a short contact line pinning period in the left side
at the beginning of the volume increase. However, the method provides
plausible results also in this case. The maximum absolute differences
between the circumcircle and the profile were similar to the findings
of the validation procedure; they did not exceed 10 pixels. The quality
of the fits was proved to be also in the range written above.

(a,c,d,f) and 30 μL (b,e) captured in the advancing (a,b,d,
and e) and receding phase (c andf). The measurements were carried
out on the SiO2 sample using two different needles with
the diameter of 0.718 mm (a–c) and 0.235 mm (d–f). The
red and blue crosses designate the points for the circumcircle construction,
and the green curves show the resultant profile after difference fitting.

6 Conclusions
A simple
and robust method was introduced to determine contact
angles in no-apex situations. The easily implementable method combines
the advantages of the circular and polynomial fit and suppresses their
inherent uncertainties. Circumscribed circles are constructed for
the undisturbed parts of drop profile independently for both sides
of the drop. These arcs pass exactly through the contact points, and
their derivative can be calculated analytically. The sixth-order polynomial
is fitted to the vertical difference between the arc and the drop
profile. The slope of this curve at the contact point gives a correction
to the value calculated from the circumcircle. The maximum absolute
difference remains below 10 pixels even for large volume drops with
large contact angles; hence, the slope of the fitted curve does not
change significantly with the actual value of the contact angle. The
accuracy of the method was investigated using sessile water droplets
with the volume of 6–30 μL on horizontal surfaces with
water contact angles of 20°–150°. The determined
advancing and receding contact angles were compared to the results
of the Young–Laplace fit. The deviation was found to be typically
≤0.6°. The difference did not show any dependence on the
actual contact angle or the number of pixel points in the arc. This
latter was assessed in the 100–250 pixels/arc range using the
same images with different resolutions (1280 × 1024 and 750 ×
600 pixels). The accuracy of the method can be further improved by
implementing subpixel resolution and extrapolating the coordinates
of the contact points. Needle-in-drop measurements were carried out
to demonstrate the capabilities of the new method using syringes with
different needle diameters. A limitation of this approach is that
the drop volume cannot be precisely obtained. However, the method
improves the accuracy of the evaluation of the needle-in-drop measurements
in the sessile drop, captive bubble, electrowetting, and electrodewetting
experiments, and it might be useful also for tilted plate measurements
as well.
