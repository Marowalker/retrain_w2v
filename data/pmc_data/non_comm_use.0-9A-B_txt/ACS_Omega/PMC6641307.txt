A new thermally activated delayed
fluorescent molecule, TRZ
3(Ph-PTZ), containing three phenothiazines as donor units and

Introduction
Since the demonstration
of the first generation of organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs) based on conventional fluorescent emitters in 1987
by Tang and VanSlyke,1 the development
of new organic electroluminescent materials as well as OLED device
physics and engineering has been the subject of intensive studies.
In particular, since the pioneering works of Thompson and Forrest,
the development of phosphorescent OLEDs based on organometallic emitters
has been proven to be very successful.2 These heavy-metal complexes, which exhibit efficient luminescence
from the triplet states at room temperature, have been already used
in a range of OLEDs exhibiting internal quantum efficiencies of 100%.
Recently, by improving the light outcoupling of the devices with a
partial horizontal orientation of the light-emitting dipoles, it was
shown that the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of phosphorescent
OLEDs can be higher than 35%.3 Nevertheless,
the high cost of heavy metals such as iridium, which are needed to
improve the spin–orbital interaction and achieve highly efficient
radiative transition from the triplet excited state to the ground
state, is a major problem for their use in commercial applications.
An alternative toward highly efficient electroluminescent devices
was proposed a few years back, which is based on the use of thermally
activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters.4 The working principle of this third OLED generation is based on
the upconversion of the lowest triplet excited state (T1) to the lowest singlet excited state (S1), using thermal
energy. For efficient TADF emission, a very small energy gap (ΔEST) between S1 and T1 and
a high yield of triplet-to-upconverted-singlet formation are both
required.

A large number of efficient TADF materials have been
synthesized
during the last few years, showing the importance of the molecular
design of the emitters to simultaneously achieve large radiative decay
rate and small ΔEST.5−9 This molecular design is generally based on a combination of electron
donor and acceptor units, which minimizes the spatial overlap between
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO). In terms of efficiency, a variety of TADF
OLEDs has already shown performances equivalent to those achieved
in phosphorescent devices. For instance, a green TADF molecule with
100% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and 100% upconversion
of the triplet to the singlet excited state was recently used in devices
with a maximum EQE of 41.5%.10 Hirata et
al. demonstrated blue TADF OLEDs with 100% internal quantum efficiency
and a maximum EQE of 20.6%.11 Regarding
red TADF OLEDs, Zhang et al. reported on the realization of high-performance
electroluminescent devices with a maximum EQE of 8.1% for an emission
maximum at 624 nm.12 Such a panel of blue,
green, and red (RGB) colors is evidently crucial for different fields
of application, such as solid-state lighting and display technologies.
In parallel, efficient yellow electroluminescence is also of strong
interest because a convenient way to obtain white light emission is
to use blue and yellow emitters. In that context, high-performance
yellow TADF OLEDs have been already reported with a maximum external
quantum efficiency as high as 18.4%.13 Nevertheless,
the design and synthesis of new yellow TADF emitters are still crucial
for the development of display and white lighting applications. In
addition, further reducing the cost of synthesis of TADF emitters
by developing simple and convenient synthetic routes, which do not
require the use of expensive catalysts and can be carried out in ambient
atmosphere, is also extremely relevant to this research field.

Results
and Discussion
In this study, we designed, synthesized, and
analyzed the electroluminescence
properties of a novel, highly efficient, yellowish-green TADF emitter, TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ), containing the 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine
for the central acceptor moiety and peripheral phenothiazine donor
units (employed in a wide range of applications).14−26 The chemical structure of this molecule is displayed in Figure 1. The design of this
molecular structure was motivated by a previous report where a 2,4,6-tri((phenoxazinyl)phenyl)-1,3,5-triazine
TADF emitter was used in a yellowish-orange OLED with a maximum EQE
of about 13%.27

Figure 1 Molecular structure of TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ).

To synthesize this compound, a simple and convenient method
is
proposed, which is based on the cobalt catalyzed cross-coupling of
arylzinc with aryl halide. The added value of this synthetic method
is to lower the production cost, thanks to the low-cost reagents employed
for the synthesis, leading then to the reduction of cost of OLED.
This advantage fits evidently well with the asset of the third OLED
generation based on metal-free emitters.

Most of the classical
reactions used for the synthesis of OLED
molecules based on 1,3,5-triazine are dominated by the use of expensive
metal catalysts such as palladium.10,27−30

To avoid the use of such expensive catalysts in the final
coupling
of the donor part (2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine) with the acceptor
one (phenothiazine) in the TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) molecule, we
synthesized a fluorine phenyl-triazine intermediate building block
based on a catalyzed cross-coupling reaction between an arylzinc and
an aryl halide (Scheme 1). The arylzinc derivative 1 ((4-fluorophenyl)zinc bromide)
was first prepared from 4-bromofluorobenzene in the presence of inexpensive
reagents such as a cobalt salt and zinc dust in acetonitrile solvent.
The resulting organozinc 1 was then engaged in the coupling
reaction with the commercially available 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine
at room temperature to form the key intermediate building block 2 (2,4,6-tris(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine).31−39 To the best of our knowledge, this latter coupling reaction is the
first example of one-pot cobalt catalyzed cross-coupling of 3 equiv
of 4-(fluorophenyl)zinc bromide with 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine.
Finally, the coupling last step of phenothiazine on fluorinated triazine 2 was carried out using the synthetic method reported previously
for pyrrole and fluorobenzene derivatives to lead to the TRZ
3(Ph-PTZ) TADF molecule.40,41 Chemical characterization
of TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ), including NMR and HRMS, is provided
in Supporting Information.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of the TADF Molecule TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) Based on
Key Intermediate Building Block 2 (2,4,6-Tris(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine)
To gain insights into the electronic
states of TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ), we performed density functional
theory (DFT) and time-dependent
density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. The ground-state geometries
were optimized with Gaussian09 software at the B3LYP/6-31G* level.
Phenothiazine has been described in previous studies to be a nonplanar,
central six-membered ring because of the presence of sulfur. In such
a moiety, the length of the (C–S) and (C–N) bonds was
estimated to be 1.76–1.77 and 1.44–1.45 Å, respectively.29 The longer length of the (C–S) bond leads
to two different molecular conformations because of rotational dynamics
of the phenothiazine.29,42,43 In that context, the TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) molecule, which
bears three phenothiazine units, is expected to show different conformations.
DFT calculations reveal two equatorial (E-1, E-2) and two axial (A-1,
A-2) conformers that show only minor energy differences (see Figure 2 and Tables S1 and S2). Energy difference between
E-1 and E-2 (and that between A-1 and A-2) is negligible; thus, we
will focus only on the first equatorial and the first axial conformers
in the following paragraphs for simplicity. Figure 3 shows the HOMOs and LUMOs of the equatorial-TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) and axial-TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) obtained.
It can be seen that both E-1 and A-1 have degenerate frontier molecular
orbitals (Table S3). Such degeneracy is
the result of the symmetrical properties of both conformers, implying
that all these orbitals can participate in the transition process.
In E-1, the HOMOs are mainly distributed on the phenothiazine unit,
whereas the LUMOs are localized on the triazine and phenyl units.
Only small overlaps between the HOMOs and LUMOs are present at the
phenyl ring connecting phenothiazine and triazine units. In the case
of A-1, however, the overlaps are quite large.

level of theory.

Figure 3 Frontier orbitals of
the quasi-equatorial (E-1) and quasi-axial
(A-1) conformers, which were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level
of theory.

As shown in Table S4, TDDFT results
reveal that S0 → S1 of E-1 is mainly
the transitions between its HOMO and LUMO (70.4%). For A-1, HOMO –
1, HOMO – 2, LUMO, and LUMO + 1 played equally important roles
in its S0 → S1. It can also be seen that
the S0 → T1 transitions for both conformers
follow similar trends. According to the orbital distributions showed
in Figure 3, one can
expect that E-1 should have smaller ΔEST than that of A-1 because ΔEST is proportional to the overlap between involved orbitals. This deduction
is confirmed by our TDDFT results using the optimized S0 structures: the calculated ΔEST of E-1 is only 0.0079 eV, whereas ΔEST of A-1 is 0.71 eV. Apparently, thermally driven upconversion
from T1 to S1 in E-1 could be quite effective.

The UV–visible absorption and steady-state photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) at room temperature in
toluene solution with a concentration of 1 × 10–5 M are presented in Figure 4a. It should be mentioned that a detailed investigation of
the photophysical properties of a TADF emitter containing a phenothiazine
electron donor and 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine electron acceptor
unit has been already reported.29 In particular,
the different conformers of this molecule and their photophysical
properties were clearly identified. On the basis of the results published
in this previous report, the absorption and PL spectra of TRZ
3(Ph-PTZ) can be easily understood. The absorption spectrum
of TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) shows an intense absorption below 300
nm, which can be assigned to the 1(π, π*) ← S0 transition derived from the triazine acceptor unit. The weak
absorption tail between 400 and 500 nm and the broad and structureless
absorption peak centered at 366 nm are both related to the intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT) character of this molecule. In particular, the
absorption tail at longer wavelengths is due to the 1CT-S0 transition of the equatorial conformer. As expected, the PL spectrum
obtained with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm shows a dual emission
with peaks around 431 and 575 nm. Similar to what was observed in
a previous study,29 the peak at 575 nm
shows the highest intensity with a large Stokes shift and a full width
at half-maximum of 108 nm. This ICT emission can be straightforwardly
assigned to the excited state of the quasi-equatorial conformation
(E-1) of TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ). The peak centered at about 431
nm exhibits a much lower intensity with a small Stokes shift, and
this emission is attributed to the excited state of the quasi-axial
conformer (A-1). It should be emphasized that this quasi-axial conformer
shows an overlap between HOMO and LUMO on the triazine acceptor unit.
The observation of a smaller Stokes shift for this conformer can be
explained by the effect of the π–π* character deduced
from the non-negligible HOMO–LUMO overlap.29

PL spectra were obtained using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm.
(c) Transient PL decay curve for a 2 wt % TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ):mCBP film measured at room temperature with an emission wavelength
of 520 nm.

To determine whether the dual
emission from TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) can also be observed in the
solid state, an organic thin film based
on a blend containing 2 wt % of TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) in a 3,3′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (mCBP) host was prepared
by thermal evaporation onto a fused silica substrate. The mCBP host
was selected because of the high triplet T1 energy of this
material, which prevents back energy transfer from the guest to the
host molecules and confines the triplets within the guest emitters.
The absorption and steady-state PL spectra of this sample are displayed
in Figure 4b. Owing
to the small concentration of the guest molecules in the host, the
absorption spectrum is completely dominated by the absorption from
mCBP. More importantly, the PL spectrum obtained with an excitation
wavelength of 340 nm does not show any emission from the mCBP matrix,
indicating that an efficient energy transfer takes place from the
host to TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) molecules. In addition, similarly
to what was observed in toluene solution, the photoluminescence from
the doped film exhibits a dual emission with two peaks at about 427
and 520 nm. Noticeably, whereas the blue emission peak from the quasi-axial
conformer presents nearly the same maximum wavelength in solution
and thin film, the PL spectrum from the equatorial conformer in the
solid state shows a significant blue shift of around 55 nm. Because
TADF materials showing ICT generally exhibit a strong solvatochromism
effect, a plausible explanation for this observation could be related
to the different polarity of the environments surrounding the TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) molecules. The transient PL decay of the equatorial
conformer in the mCBP blend was then measured using an excitation
wavelength of 337 nm. The PL decay curve displayed in Figure 4c was fitted by a sum of two
exponential decay functions, the fast and slow components corresponding
to the prompt and delayed fluorescence, respectively. The prompt and
delayed fluorescence lifetimes are measured to be 6.7 ns and 7.2 μs,
respectively. This result suggests that the highly emissive equatorial
conformer of TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) exhibits a TADF activity,
which is consistent with the small ΔEST value obtained by quantum chemistry calculations.

To investigate
the electroluminescence properties of TRZ
3(Ph-PTZ), we fabricated OLEDs with the following architecture:
indium tin oxide (ITO) (100 nm)/N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-1,10-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine
(α-NPD) (20 nm)/tris(4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl)amine (TCTA) (10
nm)/1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) (10 nm)/5
wt % TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ):mCBP (15 nm)/bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl]
ether oxide (DPEPO) (10 nm)/1,3,5-tris(2-N-phenylbenzimidazolyl)benzene
(TPBi) (55 nm)/lithium fluoride (LiF) (0.8 nm)/aluminum (Al) (900
nm). A schematic representation of this multilayer structure is provided
in Figure 5a, and its
energy diagram is shown in Figure S4. In
this device, α-NPD and mCP are used as hole transport layers,
DPEPO as hole blocking layer, and TPBI as electron transport layer.
The electroluminescence characteristics of this OLED are displayed
in Figure 5b–d.
The device shows yellowish-green electroluminescence with color coordinates
of CIE (0.23, 0.75) and exhibits a turn-on voltage of 4.2 V, a maximum
current efficiency of 58.6 cd/A, a power efficiency of 17.4 lm/W,
a maximum luminance up to 7430 cd/m2, and a high maximum
EQE of 17.4% without any light outcoupling enhancement. As shown in Figure S5, these excellent electroluminescence
performances could be reproduced in several devices. The high EQE
value is evidently well beyond the theoretical limit for conventional
fluorescent OLEDs and can be attributed to the efficient upconversion
of the triplets to singlets through TADF process, which is consistent
with the quantum chemistry and PL results presented above. However,
it can be seen that the electroluminescence spectra measured in the
device for three different current densities do not show any dual
emission, in contrast to what was reported in a previous study with
a similar emitter.29 Further photophysical
investigations as well as some device optical and electrical device
modeling that are both needed to explain this unexpected result and
optimize the dual emission from the devices are now under way. If
successful, considering the potential of combining blue and yellow
TADF emitters to achieve highly efficient white emission, we believe
that TADF emitters with dual emission such as TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) should be the subject of more intensive studies in the near future.

Conclusions
In summary, the compound TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) shows excellent
TADF characteristics and can be successfully used in a high-performance
yellowish-green OLED with a maximum external quantum efficiency of
17.4%. Photophysical measurements demonstrate that this molecule exhibits
a dual emission because of the introduction of phenothiazine unit
in the molecular structure. This moiety is responsible for the presence
of conformers showing different photophysical characteristics. Importantly,
the synthesis of this compound is carried out using a simple and convenient
method based on cobalt catalyzed cross-coupling. This process can
be used to reduce substantially the cost of the synthesis of highly
efficient TADF molecules, thanks to the low cost of cobalt employed
as catalyst for the synthesis. This advantageous method is used for
the first time to synthesize TADF emitters and can easily be extended
to other synthetic routes.

CoBr2 (0.5 mmol, 109 mg, 0.1 equiv) and Zn dust (16.5
mmol, 1.08
g, 3.3 equiv) were added in MeCN (4 mL). The mixture was stirred at
room temperature for 1 h and 4-bromofluorobenzene (5 mmol) was then
added. The reaction was stirred to give the (4-fluorophenyl)zinc bromide
reagent (80% in GC). 2,4,6-Trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (6.5 mmol, 1.3
equiv) was added at room temperature to the unfiltered solution of
(4-fluorophenyl)zinc bromide reagent. In the event of a significant
rise in temperature, the reaction mixture was cooled with a water
bath. The reaction was then stirred for 1 h. The reaction was quenched
by addition of saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (20 mL),
followed by an extraction with DCM (3 × 50 mL). The combined
organic layers were dried over MgSO4, and after filtration
the solvents were evaporated in vacuum. Purification by flash column
chromatography (SiO2, petrol ether/EtOAc = 50:1) afforded
the desired product (908 mg) in 50% overall yield. 1H NMR

min. To this white product was added and stirred (0.84 mmol, 168 mg,

the liberation of H2 gas had ceased, the orange reaction
mixture was stirred for an additional 30 min. Then, 0.28 mmol (101
mg, 1 equiv) of 2,4,6-tris(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine in 5 mL
of DMF was added in one batch. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight
at 100 °C. It was poured into 100 mL of ice water followed by
extraction with DCM (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic layers
were dried over MgSO4, and the solvents were evaporated
in vacuum. Purification by flash column chromatography (SiO2, CHCl3/cyclohexane = 1:4) afforded the desired product

Photophysical
Measurements
For the photophysical measurements,
the degassed toluene solution of TRZ 3(Ph-PTZ) was placed
in a quartz cuvette. In parallel, the organic thin film was deposited
by thermal evaporation onto a precleaned fused silica substrate. UV–visible
absorption and steady-state PL spectra were measured using a UV-2550
spectrometer (Shimadzu) and a Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer (Horiba
Scientific), respectively. The transient PL decay was measured by
a streak camera (Hamamatsu Photonics C4334). The samples were placed
under vacuum (<4 × 10–1 Pa) and photoexcited
by a nitrogen gas laser (Ken-X, Usho Optical Systems) delivering 500
ps pulses at a repetition rate of 20 Hz and emitting at 337 nm.

OLED Fabrication and Measurements
The device was prepared
using a precleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The different
organic layers were sequentially thermally evaporated under vacuum
lower than 3 × 10–4 Pa. Finally, the LiF/Al
electrodes were deposited through a shadow mask on top of the multilayer
structure. The device active area was 4 mm2. To avoid any
degradation and emission quenching due to oxygen and moisture, the
OLED was encapsulated in a glovebox filled with nitrogen. The J–V–L characteristics
were collected using a source meter (Keithley 2400, Keithley Instruments
Inc.) and an absolute external quantum efficiency measurement system
(C9920-12, Hamamatsu Photonics). An optical fiber connected to a spectrometer
(PMA-12, Hamamatsu Photonics) was used to record the electroluminescence
spectrum.
