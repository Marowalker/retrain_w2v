Excess
volumes and excess compressibilities for hard spheres in
water were computed by pressure derivatives of the excess chemical
potential, which is equivalent to the work of cavity formation. This
is relevant to the application of continuum solvation methods at various
pressures. The excess chemical potential was modeled within phenomenological
expressions for curved surfaces plus a pressure–volume term,
for which two approaches were adopted, differing for the radius of
the spherical volume. This implies a different dependence on pressure
of parameters. In all cases, in the surface term, for the pressure
derivative of parameters of the curvature function, use was made of
the previously proposed expressions for the first two moments obtained
from the density and radial distribution of oxygens in liquid water.
Only for the parameter which has the dimension of surface tension
(γ̃) was explicit dependence on pressure considered and
results are affected by the specific polynomial used. In agreement
with what inferred from simulation results obtained for cavities in
TIP4P water, negative and positive adsorptions at the contact radius
were extrapolated for a very large cavity at 1 and 8000 atm, respectively.
The expressions here employed for the excess chemical potential predict
the zero value of asymptotic adsorption to be at a pressure between
500 and 800 atm, which can be compared to results from the revised
scaled particle theory. In the same range, for a nanometer-sized cavity,
a change of behavior occurs regarding the ratio between the excess
Helmholtz free energy and the product between pressure and excess
volume.

Introduction
Partial molar volumes
and related quantities, such as excess volumes
and excess compressibility, are relevant to the study of the pressure
effect on the variation of free energy in processes occurring in solutions,1−10 mixtures,11,12 and complex environments.13−19 The study of molecular hydration and molecular interactions in water
under increasing pressure is essential to any full discussion of the
pressure denaturation of proteins,2,7,17,18 which has stimulated
many of these works. On this important problem of molecular biology,
there have been various significant contributions since Kauzmann in
195920 suggested that the hydrophobic effect
should have a prominent role in the stability of the folded form of
a protein.

In the end of the 1990s, pressure dependence of hydrophobic
interactions
was studied by Hummer et al.10 and water
incorporation into the protein was indicated as the dominant effect
that accompanies the unfolding of a protein upon increasing pressure.
More recently, on the basis of a detailed study of a methane-like
solute in water up to 3000 atm,7 it has
been concluded that the change in volume related to the exposure of
a small hydrophobic solute is negative when comparing high pressure
to atmospheric pressure, which appears to be consistent with what
is expected in the unfolding of a protein.

However, this consistency
cannot give a complete explanation of
the problem, and for some authors,17,18 the hydrophobic
effect is inadequate or irrelevant, whereas the change in volume associated
with the exposure of hydrophilic groups is much more important. In
their investigation on the origins of pressure denaturation of a protein,
Chalikian and MacGregor18 found that solvation
of peptide groups is a major driving force in the process, whereas
that of polar side chains should not be so important. According to
the same authors, another major driving force is the “the presence
and partial disappearance of large intraglobular voids”, which
still in some way leads back to hydrophobicity. This aspect has been
discussed also by Rouget et al.21 and Roche
et al.22 Although this is only a brief
survey of the main ideas on the issue, it is sufficient to illustrate
the great complexity of the problem, which is still open to debate.
Indeed, the origin of the volume decrease associated with the unfolding
of a protein has not yet been completely understood, even if it has
been recognized that changes in the solvent distribution can have
an important role in determining the sign of this volume change.7,17,21

Thus, the accurate computation
of excess volumes appears to be
very important. Simulations can be very useful to obtain insights
into this field,7−9,13−16,18,19 provided very long runs can be carried out to reduce uncertainty.
This explains why only in the past two decades the use of simulations
to compute volumetric quantities has increased,5−9,13−16,18,19,23−25 thanks to more powerful
computing resources. A comparison of different methods used to compute
excess volumes has shown consistency in their results,7,9,23,25 which are generally in good agreement with experimental data.5−7,9,24 Because
radial distribution functions are commonly obtained from simulations
and statistical theories, the first widely used method was that based
on Kirkwood–Buff (KB) integrals.26 Problems related to the statistical ensemble can be managed, and
this method is useful for the interpretation of the results.5,12,14,23,25 However, the so-called direct method7,9,23,25 is important because, without using further elaboration, it simply
applies the definition of partial molar volume working in the isobaric
isothermal ensemble.2,4 Within a third possible method,
excess volumes are computed from the slope of the curve that fits
the variation of free energy as a function of pressure when T is held constant.7−9 This method has been applied to
realistic models of solutes in water and other solvents, with the
variation of free energy computed by either the perturbative method
or thermodynamic integration.9

Similar
studies could be carried out with continuum solvation models,27 although these have so far been applied mainly
at atmospheric pressure. Within these models, a very accurate quantum
mechanical28,29 description of the solute is
possible, and this can provide new insight into the pressure effect
on solvation and interactions, especially when the dissolved molecule
contains hydrophilic groups. On the other hand, there is the challenge
of a reasonable parameterization of these models to not miss important
effects. Indeed, the free energy is computed as sums of terms and
a crucial point is the calculation of the change of free energy associated
with the formation of the cavity,27,30 to which this
study is devoted.

In these calculations, the cavity is of suitable
size and its shape
is modeled on the solute geometry. However, for the aim of this study,
it is convenient to consider the simplest case of a spherical cavity
because there is the advantage of using simple expressions,30−32 from which pressure derivatives are easily obtained33 to compute excess volumes. The pitfalls of the approximate
model based on the scaled particle theory (SPT) in computing excess
volumes at low23 and high pressures are
well known,25 whereas the revised theory
(RSPT) seems to provide satisfactory results.34,35 Alternative models30−32 formulated within the thermodynamics of surfaces
have not yet been tested on volumetric quantities.

For a macroscopic
cavity, all of the models mentioned above have
the same radial scaling. Thus, a general model includes a pressure–volume
term and a surface term, which is the product of a constant (γ̃),
the area of the surface, and a curvature factor. It is the specific
function used for this factor that determines the accuracy of calculations
and differences between models. The aim of this study is to show that
by adding a few terms to the curvature factor of the well-known Tolman
expression36 it is possible to obtain acceptable
values of excess volumes for cavities in water.

At fixed pressure
and temperature, these models describe how the
variation of free energy depends on the cavity radius, which defines
a spherical exclusion region for the centers of water molecules.23,25,33 There are no limitations in the
possible cavity size studied, whose cavity radius might be seen as
the contact radius with the center of a hypothetical solute. For this
reason, the same terminology formulated within the thermodynamics
of solutions is maintained,2,4 and the change of free
energy associated with the formation of the cavity is equivalent to
the excess chemical potential2,8 or pseudochemical potential
(μ*) of a hard-sphere solute.

Models were tested by comparison
with the simulation results of
cavities in contact with water oxygens. It is this contact distance,
here called cavity radius, that defines the studied system, whereas
the other measure of the cavity size27,30,37 is the radius of the empty region, or “void”,25 that is, the region excluded to “any
part” of the solvent molecule. The radius of the void is defined
as the difference between the contact distance (R) and the assumed value for water radius (rw), typically in the range of 1.4–1.6 Å. However,
the reader should keep in mind that the water molecule is nonspherical
and that in real systems solute and solvent domains are not sharply
separated because there is a region of electronic overlap.38 Furthermore, the models discussed here are not
suitable for cavities in which both oxygens and hydrogens have been
excluded from the same region.30 Indeed,
the change of free energy associated with the formation of such a
cavity is higher than that found when the check is made only on oxygen
centers. Also the cavity–solvent radial distribution was found,
in this case, to be very different.30

Parameterization of μ* at any pressure along the water isotherm
at 298 K was explored in a previous work33 for the commonly adopted division of the excess chemical potential,
that is, using the accessible surface and the exclusion volume. The
expression was tested on the contact value of the cavity–solvent
radial distribution, which is related to the derivative of μ*
with respect to the cavity radius.

In the present work, examination
of the derivative of μ*
with respect to pressure is done by comparison with simulation results
of excess volumes obtained by the direct method.23,25 The investigation is also extended to a second approach, which refers
to a modified pressure–volume term, in which the radius of
the spherical volume is smaller than that of the cavity. In this way,
the assumed volume includes additional terms in line with “border
thickness” models.24,39−41 This might be a reasonable first approximation because more flexible
expressions are necessary to fit simulation results of cavity excess
volumes.4,23,25,42−44 However, these were found to
be in between the volume of the void associated with the cavity and
the exclusion volume, both used as reference volumes in the decomposition
of excess volumes.25 Within the second
approach, some few cases were examined, with the assumed volume in
this range. The expression is written in a general form and includes
as a particular case that of the first approach, which is kept distinct
from the second approach because the exclusion volume is the most
natural choice as reference volume for cavities in a solvent.

The difference between the excess volume and the exclusion volume
has a clear interpretation as the change in volume associated with
cavity–solvent correlations,23,25 on which increasing
pressure has a striking effect.33 Simulation
results23,25 have shown that this change of volume can
be positive or negative depending on the pressure and cavity radius.
Thus, within the first approach, this means that the pressure derivative
of the surface term in μ* can be also negative, which at first
sight can be difficult to explain. However, this is understandable
if one recognizes the arbitrariness of the pressure–volume
term and that this is inevitable when modeling μ* with the aim
of obtaining excess volumes. Indeed, the two terms in the model do
not correspond to those in the thermodynamic decomposition of μ*,
which can only be performed if the excess volume is known. Within
the second approach, especially with an assumed volume close to that
of the void associated with the cavity, the pressure derivative of
the surface term may always result positive, which appears more in
line with what is expected. It is shown that this is reflected in
a positive derivative of parameter γ̃ with respect to
pressure, whereas this derivative becomes negative at high pressures
if the exclusion volume is assumed to be in the pressure–volume
term. At the same time, curvature parameters are strongly affected.
Relations between parameters in the two approaches are clearly defined
as a function of pressure and can be used to check the scheme adopted
in the parameterization, which for parameters entering the curvature
factor uses implicit dependence through water density, described as
a function of pressure with the expression proposed in a previous
work. Nevertheless, these relations contain γ̃, for which
a polynomial dependence on pressure is considered. Some focus is on
volume-derived quantities, such as adsorption at the accessible surface
and excess compressibility. Both quantities are relevant in the validation
of expressions used to compute the excess chemical potential. In particular,
asymptotic adsorption for a cavity of infinite radius is related to ,as suggested by Ashbaugh et al.8,35 It is shown
that the relation depends on the assumed pressure–volume
term, whereas quantities that entail the thermodynamic decomposition
of μ* are not affected by the assumption made in the model.

Methods
Excess
Volumes from the Pressure Derivative of μ*
Starting
from a pressure study at constant T of
the excess chemical potential, μ*, which defines the change
of Gibbs free energy due to the addition of one solute molecule at
a fixed position in the system,8,33,45 the excess volume can be obtained from the pressure derivative 1  From the second derivative, one can
obtain
the excess isothermal compressibility 2  which differs from
the partial molar isothermal
compressibility only for contributions of solute translation.7,18,25 As commonly used, in the definition
above, the capital letter refers to an apparent compressibility.18 The lowercase letter is used in the “excess
compressibility” of Matubayasi and Levy5 (ΔkT), which corresponds to the
product of the number density of the pure solvent and ΔKT. In this work, excess quantities are defined
with respect to an ideal solution, in which all molecular interactions
are turned off,2,4 that is, the ideal gas. Thus,
νs* is
related to the partial molar volume, νs, namely 3  where kT0 is the solvent isothermal compressibility, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature, and in accordance with the thermodynamic definition,
νs, the partial molar volume is 4  with Ns and Nw being the numbers of solute
and solvent molecules,
respectively. In this work, an infinitely dilute solution is considered
(Nw ≫ Ns) so that solute–solute interactions can be neglected. According
to the definition given by eq 3, μ* coincides with the pseudochemical potential defined
by Ben-Naim,2 and can be decomposed at
constant pressure as 5  where a* is the excess Helmholtz
free energy.4,45 In the case of a hard-sphere
solute–solvent potential, at constant T, μ*
represents the reversible work necessary to form a cavity in the solvent,46 and for very small cavities, it can be computed
from a general equation46 written in terms
of the first two moments of solvent distribution.31−33,47 When water is the solvent, this is applicable to
a cavity with radius less than ∼1.85 Å. These radii are
inappropriate to insert a real solute, but the study of such small
cavities enables a parameterization at any pressure along the isotherm
of a simple model used for larger cavities.33 For this, the most common division8,33,45 of the excess chemical potential related to a cavity
of radius R can be adopted 6  where γ̃
has the dimension of
a surface tension and fc(R) is defined in terms of a length parameter δ̃a, an energy parameter w0, and a volume parameter α32,33 7  This function equals 1 for a cavity
in the
limit of infinite radius and includes standard curvature corrections
up to the third power of 1/R.31,32,48 As in SPT, the volume in eq 6 is named exclusion volume, which
here represents the volume of the spherical region from which the
entry of water oxygen centers was prevented in simulations.23,25 The corresponding surface of radius R defines the
accessible surface, which is the most natural reference surface for
the system.

A discussion on the meaning of parameters is beyond
the scope of this study. Therefore, the surface term is not rewritten
with respect to the equimolar surface,36,42−44 whose distance from the surface of tension defines the Tolman length.36 This matter generally poses some difficult questions
that would require specific analysis.32,49 Furthermore,
the equimolar dividing surface can be defined only once the excess
volume has been computed.42−44

Pressure–Volume
Term
The pressure–volume
term in eq 6 represents
the expansive work required to form the cavity in an ideal gas.45 Actually, this term is different from that in eq 5 because the excess volume
includes a nonideal contribution,5,23 which comes
from molecular interactions and is here denoted by ΔVAIC, 8  

The acronym AIC stands for “all
interactions coupled”, and in the specific systems studied
in this work, we are referring to the coupling of water–water
interactions after a spherical exclusion volume of radius R has been defined.23,25 The decomposition above
can be derived from the KB integral.26 Thus,
ΔVAIC arises from the difference
between the real and ideal cavity–solvent correlation functions
in the domain accessible to the center of the solvent. The ideal reference
is that of a cavity in an ideal gas,50 for
which the cavity–solvent correlation is described by a Heaviside
step function. In such a case, ΔVAIC equals 0 and νs* coincides with the exclusion volume defined by the cavity.
At 298 K, the striking pressure effect on cavity–water radial
distributions (rdf) was observed to be reflected in a very different
behavior of ΔVAIC(R).25,33

At a constant pressure, a simple model
is able to describe how
ΔVAIC varies with the increase of
the cavity radius R.25,42−44 In particular, extrapolating to a nanometric radius, it was found
reasonable to use the following simple description 9  Thus, a comparable performance is in principle
provided by the pressure derivative of eq 6, as it contains terms of the same power in R plus the additional term arising from α/R3 in the curvature factor. Namely, this will
depend on the range of R in which the equation is
applied.

Concerning the interpretation of the surface term in eq 6, it is evident that its
derivative
with respect to pressure gives ΔVAIC (see eq 8). Simulation
results have shown that this quantity can be also negative, which
is well explained in terms of cavity–water correlations. However,
this implies that the surface term in μ* can decrease under
increasing pressure, which may seem unexpected if one does not recognize
that the thermodynamic decomposition in eq 5 does not correspond to that in eq 6. However, this is inevitable if
the excess volume is unknown and one wants to estimate its value from
the pressure derivative of μ*. In other words, this indicates
that, when modeling the excess chemical potential, there is some arbitrariness
in the pressure–volume term. Keeping its simplicity, eq 6 can be rewritten in a
more general form 10  where the pressure–volume term reduces
to that of the more commonly used decomposition for the length parameter
δR = 0. With a negative value of δR, there is the possibility of having a surface term that increases
with increasing pressure also when ΔVAIC is negative. It is also worthwhile to note that the volume in eq 10 becomes the volume of
the void associated with the cavity for δR = −rw, where rw is the
radius of a water molecule. The equation above preserves the asymptotic
behavior of eq 6 for
an infinite cavity radius. For instance, the value at contact of the
cavity–solvent rdf, G(R),46 converges to P/(ρKBT) with both equations. Furthermore,
by writing R as a sum of contact radii, the volume
in eq 10 is equivalent
to that of the model initially proposed by Edward et al.51 and more recently employed in the analysis of
simulation and experimental results.24,25,39−41,52

Below, we refer to eqs 6 and 10, respectively, as the pressure
cavity
excluded volume (PCEV) and modified PΔV (mPV) approaches. Differences in the results are expected
to be within uncertainties that mainly derive from the number and
quality of data used in the parameterization. Indeed, the length δR does not increase the flexibility of the model but only changes
the decomposition of μ*, so determining different parameter
values. Relations between parameters in the two approaches are clearly
defined as a function of pressure as follows 11   12   13   14  The relations
above can be used to check the
scheme adopted in the parameterization, which for parameters entering
the curvature factor uses implicit dependence through density. Nevertheless,
these relations contain γ̃, for which a polynomial dependence
on pressure is considered, regardless of the approach (PCEV or mPV).
Henceforth, to avoid the complicated notation above, the same symbols
are used for the parameters independently of the approach, which is
defined by the fixed value of δR.

Adsorption
at the Accessible Surface and γ̃(P)
At the accessible surface, which is defined
by the cavity radius R, the excess number of solvent
molecules is related to ΔVAIC42−44 15  where ρ is the solvent number density.
From this quantity, the solvent adsorption at the same reference surface
is readily obtained 16  This is an absolute
adsorption that strongly
depends on the position of the reference or dividing surface, which
in this case coincides with the cavity surface.42,43 Thus, in the expression above, the notation is simplified with respect
to the more general one used in refs42, 43. Originally, this quantity was used within the thermodynamics of
interfaces in the Gibbs approach,36 which
was then extended to boundary surfaces.53 Here, an excess number of molecules still arises from the discrepancy
between the real solvent distribution around the hard-sphere solute
with respect to an “ideal” distribution defined by the
position of the dividing surface, that is, a Heaviside function. Following
Ashbaugh and Truskett,8 the sign of the
asymptotic value of Γ in the limit of a large cavity radius
determines if γ̃ increases or decreases with increasing
pressure. This suggestion is based on the comparison of the pressure
derivative of μ* (eq 6) with the decomposition made in eq 8.

Thus, under conditions near to saturation,
because of desorption at the accessible reference surface for a large
cavity of infinite radius,8,23,42−44,54 a positive slope of
γ̃ against pressure should be expected. Moving away from
these conditions, at higher values of P along the
isotherm, the opposite should occur on the basis of a study of hydrophobic
solutes.55 This is also in line with the
different behavior shown at 142 and 8000
atm33 when increasing the cavity radius.
All said, the above holds for the PCEV approach (eq 6);33 however, when
using the mPV approach (eq 10), the pressure derivative of γ̃(P) is accordingly modified 17  where Γ∞ is the asymptotic
value of adsorption at infinity (i.e., for a very large cavity radius).
In this way, for δR held constant, γ̃
has a corresponding contribution proportional to pressure. This is
in agreement with eq 11.

Results and Discussion
Parameterization of μ* and Prediction
of G(R)
By computing , the average density of solvent centers
at the cavity surface, ρG(R),31,46 can be obtained and G(R) can be compared to simulation results of the cavity–water
oxygen pair correlation.32,33 An efficient parameterization
procedure of eq 6 was
proposed and discussed in detail in a previous work.33 Briefly, its main features are: (1) it is alternative to
fitting but less expensive; (2) it requires a preliminary study at
several pressures to determine γ̃(P);
(3) for a fixed value of γ̃, the other parameters, α,
δ̃, and w0, are determined
from conditions on G(R), G′(R), and μ*(R), applied at a chosen small radius (R0). In the preliminary study (point (2)), operations described on
point (3) were repeated at a fixed value of P until
the optimal value of γ̃ was found so that simulation results
of G(R) for a sufficient large radius
(R1) were reproduced. In this way, data
of γ̃ were determined along the isotherm with statistical
uncertainties derived from those of G(R1). Regarding the third point, continuity conditions are
imposed between eq 6 and
μ* written in terms of the first two moments of water distribution,31−33,46,47 from which follow conditions on the derived quantities, G(R) and G′(R). Owing to a complete description of the first two moments
of water distribution as functions of R and P, the aforementioned conditions can be readily applied
at any pressure along the isotherm. Within the limit of a small cavity
so that no more than two solvents centers can be found in the spherical
region of radius R, these quantities can be directly
introduced into the general relation derived from statistical mechanics
written for μ*.46

The same
procedure was applied to eq 10 for some fixed negative values of δR (see Table 1). These appear reasonable
on the basis of values found at 1 and 8000 atm25 when fitting simulation results of excess volumes with
the spherical volume of radius R + δR, which is an extremely simple model equivalent to the so-called
border thickness model.24,39−41,52 Parameters cover different ranges
(Table 1), in agreement
with eqs 11–14. In particular, for a negative δR, as shown in Figure 1, γ̃ of mPV models is larger than that of PCEV, and the
difference increases linearly with an increasing of pressure (Δγ̃
= −δRP). A smaller range
of values, for a more negative δR, is instead the
main effect on the other parameters, which define the curvature function fc(R) (eq 7). As an example, the dependence on pressure
of the length parameter δ̃ is shown in Figure 2, where curves for mPV models
were obtained from eq 12. Propagated errors from G(R1) were found to be smaller than those with the PCEV approach,
especially for the case D and at pressures greater than 4000 atm.

Figure 1 Pressure
dependence at T = 298 K for parameter
γ̃ (dyn/cm) obtained for different values of δR, which defines the pressure–volume term in μ*
(eqs 6 and 10). For PCEV, δR = 0, whereas for cases A–D
within mPV approach, see Table 1. Curves represent quadratic weighted least-squares fit.

Figure 2 Pressure dependence

obtained for different values of δR (Table 1), which defines the pressure–volume
term in μ* (eqs 6 and 10). mPV curves for cases A (orange),
B (green), C (black), and D (red) within mPV approach were obtained
from PCEV curve (blue) using eq 12.

e α was fixed along the isotherm
at the optimal value from the least-squares fit of dμ*/dR at 1 atm.32

In spite of the striking effect
on the parameters of the surface
term, as expected, the same performance was found for the PCEV and
mPV models. Here, their prediction capability on G(R) is measured by comparison with simulation results.32,33 Indeed, it should be noted that only data corresponding to R1 = 6.05 Å were used in the parameterization.
In Table 2, the square
root of the average quadratic deviation is reported, regarding comparison
of radial scaling at fixed pressures of 1 and 8000 atm and a comparison
along the isotherm for a cavity radius of 2.85 Å.

At 8000 atm, comparison made for
the PCEV approach was demonstrated
to be very good33(Figure S2). This is also highlighted by the comparison at fixed R along the isotherm shown in Figure 3. At low pressure, and particularly at 1
atm, models underestimate G(R),
whereas they give very good agreement with simulation results at a
pressure greater than 3000 atm. At atmospheric pressure (Figure S1), the maximum value of G(R) occurs for R very close to the value chosen
for the comparison (2.85 Å).32 In
this case, the largest discrepancy was observed relative to the range
defined by the two radii that were used in the parameterization procedure
(R0 = 1.67 Å and R1 = 6.05 Å). It is worthwhile emphasizing that underestimated
values in this range are accompanied by overestimated values of G(R) for a nanometer-sized cavity. However,
for the examined cases, discrepancies were small and generally within
statistical uncertainties, as shown in Figure 3.

along the isotherm (filled circles with error bars). Comparison with
values predicted by simple models of μ*, from which G(R) was obtained by computing the derivative
with respect to R.33 Results
practically do not depend on δR (Table 1), as shown in the figure for
PCEV and mPV_B1 (red line), for which pressure dependence of parameter
α was considered. The green line refers to MPV_B2 parameterization
with α fixed at its optimal value at 1 atm.

At low pressure, less than 3000 atm, a better agreement with
simulation
results of G(R) is obtained if α
is assumed to be independent of P and fixed to the
optimal value obtained by fitting results at 1 atm32 (Tables 1 and 2). In this case, continuity conditions
were applied on μ* and G(R) but not on G′(R). However,
as shown in Figure 3, results at greater pressure are worse than those obtained when
the normal procedure was used, regardless of the value of δR. This occurs also for δR = −1.75
Å, for which α was found almost constant along the isotherm
(Table 1).

Modeling γ̃
along the Isotherm and Computing Γ∞
First and second derivatives with respect
to P of all parameters entering eqs 6 and 10 were calculated
from the assumed pressure dependence of γ̃ and the first
two moments of water distribution.33 Hence,
excess volumes and derived quantities were computed. A crucial point
of the procedure is an appropriate choice of the function γ̃(P) because its derivative with respect to pressure is sensitive
to the kind of description used. As shown in Figure 1, a quadratic function is generally sufficient
to fit data in the whole range of pressure, even though results on
quantities arising from did not appear completely satisfactory,
especially at low pressures. Therefore, polynomials of higher degree
were investigated fitting γ̃ in some different ranges
of pressure (Table 3).

a Results from  (Å) and δR of PCEV
and mPV_D models (see Table 1) are compared for different polynomial descriptions of γ̃(P), whose degree (n) is indicated in the
second column. Data of γ̃ derived from simulation results
of G(R) at various values of P for a cavity radius of 6.05 Å were fitted in various
ranges of pressure, whose higher extreme is indicated in the third
column.

The quantity here
examined is Γ∞, which
is directly obtainable from , water density, and δR (eq 17). These values
(Table 3) can be compared
to those extrapolated at infinite radius from simulation results of
ΔVAIC (R) (eqs 8 and 15). By using for this purpose, a quadratic function (see eq 9), Γ∞, is −0.0394 Å–2 at P = 1 atm42−44 and 0.0331 Å–2 at P = 8000 atm.25 The comparison
shows that, at 8000 atm, a good agreement is found in some cases,
whereas at 1 atm, there is generally some discrepancy, which is larger
for the quadratic fit of γ̃(P) along
the isotherm. A less discrepant value from that extrapolated from eq 9 corresponds to fitting
with cubic and fifth polynomials over a limited (2000–4000
atm) or a more extended range, respectively. Nevertheless, in agreement
with what is expected, adsorption asymptotically converges to negative
values at low pressures and to positive values at greater pressures.
Transition between these opposite behaviors is illustrated in Figure 4 for the PCEV approach.

atm. (b) Adsorption Γ (Å–2) at the cavity
surface obtained from ΔVAIC for
cases in (a) using eqs 15 and 16.

The pressure (P–/+) at
which
Γ∞ changes sign from negative to positive
falls in the range of 520–689 atm, the specific value being
dependent on γ̃(P) fit, as detailed in Table 3. However, as expected,
results depend little on the model used for μ* (R) and, for example, when γ̃ fitting is limited to data
within 2000 atm, this pressure is estimated to be within 600–650
atm, regardless of the model assumed for μ*. In some cases,
by comparing mPV with PCEV results, discrepancies in P–/+ can be larger than 50 atm. These are accompanied
by differences in , showing that eq 17 is not exactly satisfied. This is a consequence
of the fact that mPV data of γ̃ were not obtained from
PCEV data (see eq 11) but simply by repeating the parameterization procedure with eq 10. Nonetheless, changes
of 100 atm are possible even for a small change in R0, one of the two radii used in the parameterization.
This happens, for instance, when comparing PCEV results of this work
(R0 = 1.675 Å) to those of the previous
work33 (R0 =
1.67 Å), for which P–/+ =
784 atm when using a quadratic function to fit γ̃ over
10 000 atm.

Radial Dependence of νs* and ΔVAIC at Constant Pressure: Comparison with Simulation
Results
By varying the cavity radius, at 1 and 8000 atm,
the PCEV and mPV
approaches give similar results of excess volumetric quantities, even
if the first performs slightly better. In the range delimited by the
two radii used in the parameterization, Figure 5 depicts the best PCEV curves and simulation
results of νs* obtained by the direct method. These PCEV results correspond
to the γ̃(P) for which the lowest average
deviation was obtained. At the two pressures, this is measured by
χ4 and χ5 (Table 4). By comparing the individual data values
at atmospheric pressure, deviations are generally larger than three
times the statistical uncertainties, but in the worst case (R = 6.05 Å), the relative error is less than 2%. Comparison
is much better at 8000 atm, with agreement generally within two times
the statistical uncertainties. Even at high pressure, the worst case
is for the largest cavity and the relative error is less than 1%.

Simulation results at atmospheric
pressure and at 8000 atm have
shown a very different behavior when increasing the cavity radius.23,25 By considering the two references, that is, the exclusion volume
and the cavity void (Vcv), νs* is always in between
for cavities with R ≤ 6.05 Å (Figure 5) at the two pressures
considered. This should also characterize larger cavities at 8000
atm, as a consequence of the maintenance of structured hydrated shells.33 On the contrary, at atmospheric pressure, when R is around 1 nm, due to the loss of structure that brings
to dewetting at larger cavities, νs* should become larger than the exclusion
volume. Thus, this peculiarity is well analyzed in terms of ΔVAIC (Figure 6), which becomes positive, so determining a negative
adsorption (see eqs 15 and 16). This is consistent with the sign
of Γ∞ discussed in the previous section.

Figure 6 Dependence
on the cavity radius (R) at 298.15
K and 1 atm of ΔVAIC (eq 8) obtained from νs* computed as the
pressure derivative of μ*, from eq 6 (PCEV approach) and eq 10 (mPV approach). For each model of μ*, PCEV (blue
lines) and mPV_D (red lines), the four curves refer to γ̃(P) described by a polynomial function (see Table 3) fitting data in the pressure
range of 1–2000 atm (n = 3), 6000 atm (n = 3 and 5), and 10 000 atm (n =
2). For the quadratic fit, PCEV and mPV_D lines practically overlap
for the cavities shown in the figure. Black filled circles represent
results from NPT MC simulations obtained from νs* computed by the
direct method.23,25

The feature described above is found also in excess volumes
computed
as the pressure derivative of μ*. However, the radius R+/– (Table 5) at which this change of behavior occurs
depends on the pressure description adopted for γ̃(P) (see Figure 6 and Table 3). For a quadratic polynomial fitting over the complete range of
pressures investigated, this radius is overestimated with respect
to simulation results, for which the inversion of sign was observed
between 8 and 10 Å.23,25 By increasing the degree
of the polynomial and decreasing the range of pressure of the fitted
data, regardless of the value of δR in the expressions
adopted for μ*, it is possible to obtain improved results of R+/–. Generally, a better agreement for
this quantity corresponds to the cases with a more negative Γ∞ (see Table 3), but unfortunately this does not imply a quantitative agreement
of ΔVAIC (Figure 6), at least when this quantity increases
with R (Figure 6). Indeed, χ4 is larger when all of
the data are included in the analysis (Table 4). Nevertheless, for R larger
than 6.05 Å, the corresponding relative error on νs* is 4–5%.
It is worthwhile recalling that statistical uncertainties on γ̃
data were in all cases much more larger than discrepancies between
the fitting curves, which mainly differ for the computed slope (Table 3). Therefore, the
critical problem of having accurate derivatives is reflected in volume
calculations based on the pressure derivative of μ*. This suggests
that the number of data should be increased and statistical uncertainties
on G(R) should be further reduced.

b Γ∞ was always
positive.

At the same time,
the expression used for μ* appears to be
important. At a qualitative level, the simple models here investigated
are able to predict the nonmonotonic behavior and the change of sign
of ΔVAIC. In this respect, they
perform better than the approximate SPT expression23,33,46 but can likely be improved by adding some
other term,48 or modified to have a more
accurate scaling from small to nanometer-sized cavities.8,32 Nevertheless, within the range of radii for which this volumetric
quantity decreases (Figure 6), it is possible to achieve a satisfactory agreement with
simulation results (Table 4). This happens also at a constant high pressure, 8000 atm
(Figure 7), for which
a good performance of the simple models here investigated is reasonably
expected also at larger cavities because ΔVAIC is predicted to vary monotonically with R, without change of sign.

lines), and mPV_D (red lines), the curves refer to γ̃(P) described by a polynomial function (see Table 3) fitting data in the pressure
range of 1–8000 atm for n = 2, 3, 5 (green
numbers). Lines practically overlap in all cases, except for n = 5. Black filled circles represent results from NPT MC
simulations obtained from νs* computed by the direct method.23,25

Dependence on Pressure
of νs* at Fixed Radius: Comparison with Simulation
Results
In line with what is observed for small cavities
(see Appendix), excess volumes of larger cavities
mainly decrease when pressure increases with slopes that become more
pronounced when cavity radius increases. In Figures 8 and 9, simulation
results obtained by the direct method23,25 are shown
for radii of 2.85 and 6.05 Å, respectively. These cavities can
approximately hold, respectively, a water molecule and a hypothetical
spherical solute slightly larger than the fullerene molecule. Curves
in the figures refer to results obtained from pressure derivatives
of μ* described within the PCEV approach for some γ̃(P) profiles. Results from the mPV approach were very similar
(Figures S5–S8), in particular when
the normal parameterization was used, that is, including the dependence
on pressure of parameter α.

On average, for both cavities
(see the last two columns of Table 4), the best description
of dependence on pressure of νs* corresponds to a cubic polynomial fitting
of γ̃ in the range of pressure up to 8000 atm. In this
case, a good extrapolation at 10 000 atm was observed, whereas
by extending the range, the results were worsened and very similar
to those obtained by a quadratic profile of γ̃(P) (Figure 10). Discrepancies with respect to simulation results were found within
three times the statistical uncertainties for R =
2.85 Å, but become larger for R = 6.05 Å.
However, these were more significant for the smaller cavity, with
a relative maximum error of 13%, whereas for the larger cavity, this
was of 3%. As shown in Figures 8 and 9, a better agreement is reached
over a range up to 4000 atm by increasing the degree of the polynomial
or decreasing the range of pressure in the fitting of γ̃
(see also Table 4).
This happens in particular for the larger cavity, with relative discrepancies
generally within 1%. Correspondingly, it is evident that there is
an improvement in the slope when compared to the simulation results
of ΔKT (Figures 8b and 9b).

Figure 10 Simulation
results at 298.15 K of νs* (cc/mol) computed by the direct method
(filled squares) for a cavity radius of 6.05 Å in TIP4P water
plotted against pressure. The black line represents results from fits
of quantities related to average accessible volumes in the solution
and in water with eq 16 of previous work.25 Colored lines represent results from pressure derivative of μ*
computed within the PCEV approach (eq 6) for a quadratic fit of γ̃(P) made over 10 000 atm. The blue line (this work) differs
from the red line33 only for R0, the radius used in the parameterization. The error
bars refer to evaluated propagated errors. The green line differs
from the red line only for parameters in eq 16 of the previous work25 fitted to experimental data of water density
instead of TIP4P water (see ref (33)).

Sensitivity to density was studied within the same approach
for
μ* and using the two expressions proposed in a previous work33 for the pressure dependence of water density
with optimal parameters determined by fitting experimental or TIP4P
data. It can be noted that these different data give the same trend
with pressure, with excess volumes generally in good agreement, the
discrepancies being within or only slightly larger than three times
the errors estimated from parameters’ uncertainties. For clarity,
in Figure 10, comparison
only with results relative to the PCEV approach is shown. The same
conclusions on sensitivity to density were reached with the modified PΔV (mPV) approach and regardless
of the model adopted for γ̃(P).

Excess
Helmholtz Free Energy from the Thermodynamic Decomposition
of μ*
Using the thermodynamic decomposition of μ*
(eq 5), which holds for
the cavity formation at constant pressure, the excess Helmholtz free
energy, a*, was computed as the difference between
μ* and Pνs* for excess volumes computed from the
pressure derivative of μ*. The asymptotic value for a cavity
of infinite radius of the corresponding excess Helmholtz free energy
per unit area, a*/(4πR2), is plotted against pressure in Figure 11. Results depend on the γ̃(P) description and can be characterized by a plateau between
2000 and 4000 atm or increase monotonically with increasing pressure,
as in the case of the cubic polynomial fitting data up to 8000 atm.
The presence of a maximum is unexpected and should indicate wrong
extrapolation or an artifact due to fitting conditions. Nevertheless,
in all cases, values fall in the same range spanned by the parameter
γ̃, and are in between those of the PCEV and mPV_C models
(Figure 1). However,
these parameters have no particular meaning and can be very different
(Figure 1), but this
does not affect significantly the derived thermodynamic quantities.
Indeed, as for excess volumes, the two approaches investigated yield
very similar results (Figure S9).

Figure 11 Asymptotic
value (R → ∞) of the
excess Helmholtz free energy per unit area, a*/(4πR2), plotted against pressure at 298.15 K. Results
obtained from μ* and νs* (eq 5) using PCEV approach for some γ̃(P) profiles (see Table 3) and TIP4P water density described with eq 7 of previous work.33

Figure 12 Effect of increasing pressure on the ratio Pνs*/a* plotted against the cavity radius R at 298.15
K. Results obtained from the PCEV approach and a fifth polynomial
to fit γ̃(P). Green lines refer to pressures
up to 100 atm (increments of 20 atm), blue lines refer to pressures
between 200 and 1000 atm (increments of 100 atm), and red lines refer
to pressures between 2000 and 8000 atm (increments of 2000 atm).

Thus, also the ratio Pνs*/a* was found
to be weakly dependent on the pressure–volume term assumed
in the model. Figure 12 shows the striking effect of increasing pressure for cavities with R within 10 nm. Under ambient conditions, in agreement with
general solvation processes,2,4Pνs* is very small
with respect to a*. Far from these conditions, the
weight of Pνs* increases, becoming dominant at very high
pressures. For a cavity of 10 nm, the relative importance of the two
contributions to μ* is inverted approximately at the pressure
at which Γ∞ becomes positive (see P–/+ in Table 3). On the other hand, for a cavity of 1 nm,
this occurs at a higher pressure (∼2000 atm).

Optimal Value
of δR and the Border Thickness
The spherical
volume in eq 10 can
be used to fit data of excess volumes: 18  and it is equivalent to the so-called
border
thickness model, which has been used to fit experimental data of various
molecules in water, including some proteins.24,40 The border thickness is recovered from δR + rw for an assumed value of rw, the radius of a water molecule. For rw = 1.38 Å, the border thickness of cavities in TIP4P
water falls in the range of 0.72–1.38 Å at atmospheric
pressure for R up to 1 nm, whereas at 8000 atm, its
value drops to ≃0.5 Å.25 The
results at 1 atm reflect dewetting at the cavity–water interface25 and are consistent with those found for soft
spherical repulsive solutes.41 Attractive
solute–water interactions bring about a smaller border thickness,41 and its value increases from 0.4 to 1 Å,
for “cavity volumes” extracted from experimental data
of solutes with van der Waals radii between 3 and 7 Å.40 According to Ashbaugh et al.,41 this is related to the assumed spherical shape of the solute
and the “molecular border thickness”, with values within
0.5 Å, increases very little with solute size. The “spherical
border thickness” model, albeit approximate, remains useful
for correlating partial molar volumes and making comparisons. However,
one should be aware that it is a phenomenological expression and it
should be interpreted with some caution. In particular, given the
definition of an exclusion volume in the systems studied in this work,
the border thickness cannot be assimilated to the thickness of an
“empty layer devoid of water surrounding the solute”.25

Differently from when fitting excess volumes,
as stated in previous sections, δR cannot be considered
a “true” parameter in the expression of the excess chemical
potential defined by eq 10 because it does not add flexibility to the model. Therefore, there
is no interest to optimize its value to improve results of excess
volumes obtained by the pressure derivative of μ*. Nevertheless,
an appropriate choice of its value can be based on other considerations.
For instance, with a negative value of δR around
−1.75 Å, the surface term increases with increasing pressure
and curvature parameters show small variations along the isotherm
compared to those of the PCEV approach (δR = 0).
Furthermore, eq 11 suggests
the possibility of deriving a comparable length quantity from the
asymptotic value of the excess Helmholtz free energy per unit area 19  This quantity is plotted in Figure 13a, and the corresponding border
thickness in Figure 13b. Results obtained with different values of γ̃(P) substantially agree up to 4000 atm, where the decrease
seen at low pressures could be related to the decrease in dewetting
at the cavity–water interface expected under increasing pressure.
The large value of 3–4 Å could be consistent with the
increase of the border thickness with cavity size, which was observed
at 1 atm, whereas the value at 8000 atm is very close, in one case,
to that found fitting simulation results. This happens for γ̃(P) described by a cubic polynomial and fitted up to this
pressure. On the basis of the above, it seems quite reasonable to
introduce as δR in eq 18 the function δ* (R,P) defined in eq 19. Hence, with this model for excess volumes, the pressure
of zero adsorption at the accessible surface (P–/+) is obtained for δ∞* = 0, which corresponds to a border thickness
of 1.38 Å (see Figure 13). Its value falls in the range of 700–800 atm, which
is higher by 50–100 atm than the values reported in Table 3.

Figure 13 (a) Pressure dependence
at 298.15 K for the length δ* (Å)
obtained from eq 19 with a* derived from μ* and νs* within PCEV approach in the asymptotic
limit for a cavity of infinite radius. Lines represent results for
some γ̃(P) profiles (see Table 3) and TIP4P water density described
with eq 7 of previous work.33 The blue
line corresponds to γ̃ fitted to data over 8000 atm with
a cubic polynomial function. In the same range, γ̃ was
fitted with polynomial functions of degree 4 (green line) and degree
5 (magenta line). The red line corresponds to the fit over 6000 atm
with a cubic polynomial function. (b) The corresponding border thickness
computed as δ* + rw (colors as in
(a)).

Conclusions
Regardless
of the approach, the results of Γ∞ computed
by the simple models investigated were consistent with
the sign of adsorption values extrapolated at infinity from simulation
results at 1 and 8000 atm, these being negative and positive, respectively.
This change of behavior is here predicted to occur between 500 and
800 atm. However, when considering the cases for which a more negative
Γ∞ is obtained at atmospheric pressure, this
range decreases to 600–650 atm. This pressure also marks the
crossover from a* > Pνs* to a* < Pνs* regimes for a cavity of ∼10 nm.

PCEV and mPV approaches yield similar results of excess volumes
and are qualitatively in agreement with simulation results. At a quantitative
level, relative errors generally were within a few percentages. It
is worthwhile remarking that results obtained from the method based
on the pressure derivatives of μ* are very sensitive to . In fact, within the same approach, for
a variety of polynomial description of γ̃(P), some disagreement is possible on volumetric quantities despite
a good agreement on G(R) and μ*.
On the other hand, pressure dependence of water density and of the
average number of oxygen pairs observed in spherical region of radius
less than 1.85 Å are fundamental in determining the main qualitative
features of pressure dependence of νs* and compressibility.

Clearly,
the simple models investigated in the present work are
much more valid at greater pressure than at low pressure, for which
more sophisticated expressions are necessary. Further improvement
can be expected from a more accurate description of the excess chemical
potential in scaling from microscopic to nanometric cavity size,32,34,35 as well as using additional information
in the parameterization. On the basis of comparison at atmospheric
pressure with expressions formulated in the framework of the thermodynamics
of surfaces32 and over the range of 3000
atm with revised scaled particle theory (RSPT),34,35 values of γ̃ obtained with simple models appear overestimated
by approximately 10–15 dyn/cm. At the same time, P–/+ appears underestimated by about 200–400
atm.

Simulation Details
Simulation results used for comparisons
in this work have been
published and discussed in previous works.23,25,32,33,43,44 NPT Monte Carlo simulations
at 298.15 K were run using a version of the BOSS57 program, which was appropriately modified to study hard-sphere
cavities in water. For water molecules, the TIP4P potential56 was used. At atmospheric pressure, Nw = 216, 512, and 1435 for cavity radii up to 10 Å,
whereas for the other pressures, Nw =
512 for cavity radii up to 6.05 Å. In all cases, the center of
the cavity was fixed at the center of the box and water–water
interactions were truncated with a cutoff of L/2
(L being the box length). Very long simulations were
run to reduce statistical uncertainties in excess volumes, which were
computed by the direct method. The number of MC configurations used
to compute averages varied between 5 × 108 and 5 ×
1010.

Appendix A
For R ≤ 1.85 Å,
excess volumes can
be obtained from the pressure derivative of μ*, written in terms
of the first two moments of pure water due to the heuristic model
describing their dependence on radius and pressure.33,46 Volumetric quantities obtained with this method are important because
all of these basic relations were used in the parameterization and
application of eqs 6 and 10. At a fixed cavity radius, excess volume dependence
on P is shown in Figure 14a, where comparison is made with simulation
results obtained by the direct method for some selected radii at pressure
values of 1 and 8000 atm. Results are in agreement within statistical
uncertainties. Unfortunately, these were quite significant, despite
simulation runs being very long. This is a well-known limitation of
the direct method when it is applied to such small cavities.8,23,43,44

Figure 14 Small cavities in TIP4P water at T = 298 K (R between 1.60 and 1.90 Å, step of 0.5 Å). (a)
Pressure dependence of νs* (cm3/mol) obtained from P derivative of μ* written in terms of the first two
moments of water distribution (see eqs 7, 9 and 10 of a previous work33). Values from MC simulations of cavities in
TIP4P water are also shown for radii of 1.60 Å (circles) and
1.75 Å (filled squares) at 1 and 8000 atm. (b) Pressure dependence
of the corresponding negative pressure derivative (eq 2). The inset shows the same quantity
in the range of −0.0002 to 0.0002 cm3/(mol atm)
for P between 1 and 7 atm. Arrows indicate increasing R.

As shown in the figure,
excess volumes generally decrease with
pressure. For such small cavities, it can be supposed that this mainly
depends on the decrease in water compressibility. The excess isothermal
compressibility, ΔKT, computed as
the negative pressure derivative of νs*, is shown in Figure 14b. Even if this quantity is very small,
the observed trend with increasing pressure is interesting because
of some similarities with results obtained for methane in water.7 The inset in the figure shows that at low pressures
excess compressibility changes sign from negative to positive at a
value of P that increases with cavity radius. For
the largest cavities in the range, this occurs at a pressure of ≃6
atm. Namely, the comparison above can hold only at a qualitative level,
and a systematic comparison with simulation results of ΔKT for such small cavities is beyond of the scope
of this work. We simply report that at 8000 atm negative values were
obtained in disagreement with the positive (even if very small) values
shown in Figure 14b. Discrepancies are larger than statistical uncertainties and could
be ascribed to systematic errors in volumes or to some limitations
of the theory.58,59
