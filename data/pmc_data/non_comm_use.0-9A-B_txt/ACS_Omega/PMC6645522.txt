A series of polymer solar cells (PSCs)
were prepared with different
solvent additive 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) doping volume ratio to adjust
the phase separation of active layers. The optimized PSCs exhibit
a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.09%, along with an open-circuit
voltage of 1.01 V, a short circuit current density of 13.64 mA cm–2, and a fill factor of 58.70%. All the key photovoltaic
parameters of PSCs can be simultaneously increased by incorporating
1.0 vol % CN in blend solutions due to the optimized phase separation
of active layers assisted by the volatilization of CN. Over 24% PCE
improvement can be obtained by incorporating 1.0 vol % CN, indicating
that the dynamic process of film forming should play the vital role
in determining the performance of PSCs.

1 Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have achieved rapid development during
the past decade, especially for nonfullerene materials as electron
acceptors.1−6 Many efforts have been made to improve the performance of PSCs from
material synthesis and device engineering sides. Tandem or ternary
strategy has been commonly investigated to improve the performance
of PSCs by enhancing photon harvesting with two subactive layers or
one active layer containing three different band gap materials.7 In fact, ternary PSCs have been demonstrated
as an efficient and potential strategy due to its simple device fabrication
process.8−11 Nonfullerene materials have attracted more attention due to their
tunable band gap, energy levels, and high absorption coefficients,
leading to the enhanced open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short circuit current density (JSC).12−14 The dynamic process of film formation also plays
the vital role in determining phase separation of active layers, which
will greatly affect the exciton dissociation and charge transport
efficiency. Solvent additives with different boiling point and selective
dissolution of donor or acceptor have been used to adjust the phase
separation for improving the performance of PSCs, such as 1,8-diiodooctane,
1-chloronaphthalene (CN), 1,8-octanedithiol, diphenylether, poly(dimethylsiloxane),
etc.15−20 Different solubilities of donor or acceptor in solvent additive
are used to optimize the phase separation in the active layers, especially
in the rapid thin-film formation progress during spin-coating. Thermal
annealing and solvent vapor treatment were also commonly used to optimize
phase separation of the active layers. Recently, upside-down thermal
annealing and upside-down solvent vapor treatment were successfully
developed to finely adjust the phase separation for improving the
fill factor (FF) of PSCs.21 The photovoltaic
parameters of PSCs can be simultaneously improved by selecting appropriate
materials and employing active layer treatments.

Here, the recent
progress in PSCs with VOCs close to or
more than 1.0 V are summarized in Table 1. Most PSCs exhibit relatively
low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and FFs if the VOCs are close to or more than 1.0 V, which may be due
to insufficient exciton dissociation of the relatively low offsets
between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals levels of donor and
acceptor. Meanwhile, there is plenty of room for FF improvement of
PSCs with relatively high VOC. In this
work, polymer material PBDB-T as the donor and nonfullerene material
O-IDTBR as the acceptor were selected to prepare PSCs with 1-chloronaphthalene
(CN) as solvent additive. The optimized PSCs exhibit relatively high VOC of 1.01 V and PCE of 8.09% for the active
layer with 1.0 vol % CN, which are acceptable among the previous values.
Compared with the PSCs without CN solvent additive, three photovoltaic
parameters of PSCs can be simultaneously improved by incorporating
1.0 vol % CN, resulting from the optimized phase separation of the
active layers. Figure 1 exhibits the chemical structures of the used materials, the device
structure schematic diagram, and the energy levels of the used materials.

2 Results and Discussion
The absorption spectra of neat PBDB-T
and O-IDTBR films were recorded,
and the normalized absorption spectra are shown in Figure 2a. The absorption peaks of
neat PBDB-T and O-IDTBR film are about 625 and 695 nm, respectively,
with a large spectral overlapping from 600 to 650 nm. The absorption
spectra of blend films with different CN doping volume ratio were
measured and are shown in Figure 2b. The absorption spectra of blend films exhibit a
marked absorption peak at about 630 nm, resulting from the large absorption
spectral overlapping of the neat films. The effect of CN doping volume
ratio on the absorption intensity of blend films can be mostly neglected,
the slightly decreased absorption intensity may be due to the low
concentration of mixed solutions with more CN. To investigate the
effect of CN doping volume ratio on the performance of PSCs, the current
density versus voltage (J–V) curves were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with light intensity
of 100 mW cm–2, as shown in Figure 3a.

quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding PSCs.

Markedly different photovoltaic
parameters can be clearly observed
from the J–V curves of the
corresponding PSCs for the active layers with different CN doping
volume ratios, although the absorption spectra of all blend films
almost overlapped. The PCE of PSCs without CN is 6.48%, with a relatively
low JSC of 12.95 mA cm–2, VOC of 0.99 V, and FF of 50.35%. For
the active layers with different CN doping volume ratios, the FFs
and JSCs of the PSCs can be markedly improved
and then slightly decreased along with the increase of the CN doping
volume ratio. Meanwhile, the VOCs of the
PSCs can be kept almost constant, with a rather small fluctuation
of less than 0.03 V. The PCE of the optimized PSCs reaches 8.09% for
the active layer with 1.0 vol % CN, along with a JSC of 13.64 mA cm–2, a VOC of 1.01 V, and a FF of 58.70%. The marked increase
in FF exhibits that the phase-separation degree can be well optimized
by incorporating appropriate CN in the blend solutions. The series
resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) can be calculated according to the J–V curves of PSCs without or with
different CN doping volume ratios. The optimized PSCs with 1.0 vol
% CN exhibits a minimal RS of 12 Ω
cm2 and a maximal RSH of 647
Ω cm2, which can well support the relatively high
FF. The key parameters of PSCs with different CN doping volume ratios
are summarized in Table 2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all the PSCs were
recorded and are shown in Figure 2b. The EQE values of the PSCs with 1.0 vol % CN are
slightly larger than those of other PSCs, which may result from the
optimized exciton dissociation, charge transport, and collection dependence
on phase separation.

To further investigate the effect
of CN doping volume ratio on
the performance of PSCs, the J–V curves of the PSCs were measured in dark and under one standard
simulation solar light illumination. The photocurrent density (JPH) can be calculated according to the equation: JPH = JL – JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under 100 mW cm–2 light illumination and in dark conditions.43−45 The JPH versus effective voltage (Veff = V0 – Va) curves of the PSCs without or with 1.0 vol
% CN are exhibited in Figure 4a, where V0 is the voltage for JPH = 0 and Va is
the applied bias. It is apparent that JPH of the PSCs with 1.0 vol % CN rapidly reaches the saturated states
compared with the PSCs without CN under a relatively low bias, indicating
the more efficient charge transport in the active layer with 1.0 vol
% CN. According to the JPH versus Veff curves, the exciton dissociation and the
charge collection efficiency could be evaluated by the ratios of JPH to saturation photocurrent density (JSAT) at short circuit or maximal power output
conditions, respectively. The detailed values of the PSCs without
and with 1.0 vol % CN are summarized in Table 3. The exciton dissociation and charge collection
efficiency can be simultaneously improved by adding 1.0 vol % CN,
resulting from the optimized phase separation. To further investigate
the positive effect of 1.0 vol % CN on the performance of PSCs, the J–V curves of PSCs without and with
1.0 vol % CN were measured under different light intensities (Plight) from 1 to 100 mW cm–2. According to the J–V curves,
the relationship between JSC and Plight are presented in Figure 4b, which can be evaluated by the power-law
formula of JSC ∝ Plightα.46,47 The bimolecular
recombination in active layers can be negligible if the fitted parameter
α is close to 1. The fitted parameter α is about 0.853
or 0.866 for the PSCs without or with 1.0 vol % CN, which are slightly
far away from 1. The bimolecular recombination in both kinds of active
layers cannot be neglected, resulting in the relatively low FF of
PSCs. The FF of 58.70% for PSCs with 1.0 vol % CN is slightly larger
than that of 50.35% for PSCs without CN, which can be well explained
according to the values of the fitted parameter α.

The hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated to investigate
the effect of CN doping volume ratio on the charge mobility in the
active layers with the configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layers/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active
layers/2,9-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)anthrax[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H) tetraone (PDIN)/Al, respectively. The ln(Jd3/V2)–(V/d)0.5 curves of hole-only and electron-only
devices are shown in Figure 5a,b. The electron mobility (μe) and hole
mobility (μh) can be calculated according to the
ln(Jd3/V2)–(V/d)0.5 curves, as listed in Table 4. It is apparent that the hole and electron
mobilities in the active layers can be increased and decreased along
with the increase in CN doping volume ratio. For the active layers
with 1.0 vol % CN, μe and μh reach
3.93 × 10–4 and 7.10 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively.
Meanwhile, the hole and electron transport in the active layers with
1.0 vol % CN become more balanced, which is beneficial to improve
the charge collection in the corresponding PSCs. The ratio of μh to μe reaches 1.81 for the PSCs with 1.0
vol % CN, leading to the relatively large FF of PSCs. As we known,
both photogenerated hole and electron can be efficiently collected
by individual electrode, leading to the performance improvement of
PSCs.

To further investigate the effect of CN doping volume ratios on
the phase separation of the blend films, the transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of the blend films were recorded and are shown
in Figure 6. It is
known that the bright and dark zones represent the donor or the acceptor
domain due to their different electron densities, respectively.48,49 It is apparent that the phase-separation degree of the blend films
can be markedly adjusted by incorporating different volume ratios
of CN. For the blend films without CN, no distinctive characteristics
can be observed from the TEM image due to the homogeneous distribution.
The homogeneous distribution of PBDB-T and O-IDTBR should be beneficial
to exciton dissociation due to the sufficient interface and be detrimental
to charge transport in the blend films. Most of the photogenerated
charge may be easily recombined in the active layers, leading to the
relatively low FF. As seen from the TEM images of the blend films
with different CN doping volume ratios, the relatively large bright
and dark zones indicate the more efficient charge transport channels
due to the large donor and acceptor domain sizes. The large domain
size should be beneficial for charge transport and detrimental to
exciton dissociation in the active layers. Therefore, an appropriate
phase separation is very necessary to form bicontinuous interpenetrating
network for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in
the active layers. The optimized phase separation degree may be obtained
for the blend films with 1.0 vol % CN, well in accordance with the
relatively high FF of the corresponding PSCs.

films processed with different CN doping
volume ratios.

3 Conclusions
A series of PSCs with PBDB-T as donor and O-IDTBR as acceptor were
prepared with different CN doping volume ratios to adjust the phase
separation degree of the active layers. The optimized PSCs exhibit
a PCE of 8.09%, with a JSC of 13.64 mA
cm–2, a VOC of 1.01
V, and a FF of 58.70% for the active layers with 1.0 vol % CN. Compared
with the PSCs without CN, all of the photovoltaic parameters can be
simultaneously improved by incorporating appropriate CN to optimize
the phase separation. More than 24% PCE improvement can be obtained
by incorporating 1.0 vol % CN into the blend solutions, indicating
that the dynamic process of thin film formation should play a vital
role in determining the performance of PSCs.

4 Experimental
Section
The indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates
(15 Ω
sq–1) were continuously cleaned by sonication in
detergent, deionized water, and ethanol. The cleaned ITO substrates
were dried by high-purity nitrogen and treated by oxygen plasma for
a minute to further improve their working function and clearance.
Afterward, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS, purchased from H.C. Starck co. Ltd.), as a hole transport
layer, was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 5000 rpm for 40 s
and dried at 150 °C for 10 min in atmospheric air. Then, ITO
substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS films were transferred into a high-purity
nitrogen-filled glovebox to fabricate active layers. The used materials,
PBDB-T and O-IDTBR, were purchased from Organtecsolar Materials Inc.
and Derthon Optoelectronic Materials Science Technology Co LTD, respectively.
The mixed PBDB-T/O-IDTBR powder with a weight ratio of 1:1 was dissolved
in chlorobenzene to prepare 20 mg/mL blend solutions and different
1-chloronaphthalene (CN) volumes (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 vol %) were
doped into the blend solutions. The solutions were spin-coated onto
the PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrates at 2300 rpm for 40 s to prepare the active
layers. And then, the prepared active layers were annealed at 80°
for 10 min in a high-purity nitrogen-filled glovebox. The small molecule
2,9-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)anthrax[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H) tetraone (PDIN) was dissolved in methanol with the addition
of 0.28 vol % acetic acid to prepare a 2 mg/mL solution. Then, the
prepared PDIN solution was spin-coated onto the active layers at 3000
rpm for 40 s to prepare the cathode interfacial layer. Finally, 100
nm aluminum (Al) was deposited with a mask by thermal evaporation
under vacuum of 4 × 10–5 Pa. The active area
is approximately 3.8 mm2, which is defined by the overlapping
area of ITO anode and Al cathode. A series of PSCs were fabricated
with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Al, with the
only difference of the CN doping volume ratios in the blend solutions.
The detailed characteristics of the PSCs and the corresponding blend
films are the same with that reported in our previous works.10,11
