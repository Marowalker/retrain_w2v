The function of tetrabutyl ammonium
ions (TBA+) in a
sensitizer used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) is contradictory.
TBA+ can reduce unwanted charge-recombination by protecting
the TiO2 surface and reduce dye aggregation, enhancing
the photovoltaic performance. It will also compete with the dye-loading
on the TiO2 film, decreasing the short-circuit current
density of the cell. Three ruthenium sensitizers (DYE III, DUY11,
and DUY12 containing two H+, one H+/one TBA+, and two TBA+, respectively) were prepared to
systematically investigate the function of TBA+ in a dye
for DSC under both standard sunlight and indoor illumination. The
optical properties and frontier orbital energy level of the sensitizers
are not influenced significantly by the number of TBA+.
Under the standard 1 sun illumination, DSCs based on DUY11 (containing
one H+ and one TBA+) achieved the highest power
conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.47%. Overall, optimized DSCs sensitized
by the three ruthenium dyes all have the PCE over 10%, which is higher
than that (9.95%) of N719-dyed cell fabricated at the same conditions.
Under the illumination of a light emitting diode (LED), DSCs sensitized
by DUY11 also have the highest efficiency of 19%. Furthermore, DUY12
with two TBA+ exhibits superior photovoltaic performance
compared to a DYE III (containing two H+ in the anchoring
ligands)-dyed cell; although these two dyes have similar photovoltaic
performance under standard 1 sun lighting. The important function
of TBA+ in reducing the charge recombination (by protecting
TiO2 surface and avoiding dye aggregation) of a DSC under
indoor lighting (when small number of electrons were excited by weak
light) is also revealed.

Introduction
Almost three decades
have passed since the first dye-sensitized
solar cell (DSC) using the trimetric ruthenium complex as a sensitizer
was announced by O’Regan and Grätzel in 1991.1 Most of the small-area lab-testing DSCs show
a middling (<10%) power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) measured
under standard, AM 1.5G, 1 sun (100 mW cm–2) simulated
light, even though so many sensitizers have been developed focusing
on achieving high PCE.2,3 In a DSC, the dye adsorbed on
TiO2 surface is through its anchoring ligand and carboxylic
acid group is the most popular anchor for ruthenium-based dyes.4 The major role of the anchoring group is to transfer
the electron from the photoexcited dye into the TiO2 conduction
band. Moreover, upon dye adsorption, the anchoring groups transfer
most of their protons to the TiO2 surface, charging it
positively, and therefore, lowering its conduction band edge (ECB).5 Lowering the
TiO2ECB increases the driving
force for injecting electron from the photoexcited dye into the TiO2 conduction band, resulting in increasing the short-circuit
current density (JSC) of the cell. Nevertheless,
the protonation of TiO2 simultaneously reduces the energy
difference between the TiO2ECB and the redox potential of the electrolyte, resulting in a smaller
open circuit voltage (VOC). In contrast,
replacing the H+ in the sensitizer with another less acidic
ion such as tetrabutylammonium ion (TBA+) (called dye deprotonation)
will result in higher VOC, but lower JSC (due to less efficient electron-injection
from the photoexcited dye to TiO2) of the corresponding
cell. Consequently, there is an optimal degree of deprotonation for
a sensitizer to maximize the product of JSC and VOC of the cell to reach the highest
PCE.

TBA+ ion, similar to GuSCN (guanidinium thiocyanate),
known as an additive in the electrolyte solution can cover the TiO2 surface, suppress the charge-recombination (electron on TiO2 reacts with the oxidant species (I3–) in the electrolyte) without changing significantly the TiO2ECB level due to its dilute charge
density.6,7 Therefore, the drawback of protonation on
the TiO2 film can be reduced by replacing the acidic protons
with TBA+ ions in the sensitizer. This strategy was proved
successfully in two representative ruthenium-based dyes, N38 and N749 (black dye).9 In 2003, Nazeeruddin10 et al. investigated
the photovoltaic properties of five N3-based dyes, which have different
levels of protonation on their two anchoring groups to understand
what is the optimal degree of protonation for DSC application. Under
the 1 sun standard condition, the monoprotonated form (N3[TBA]3) exhibited superior PCE of 9.3% compared to the other four
dyes: zero- (N712), two- (N719, η = 8.4%), three- (N3[TBA]),
and four- (N3) protonated sensitizers.10 Later, the same group optimized the two-protonated N719-based cell
to reach the efficiency of 11.18%,11 without
mentioning the optimized photovoltaic performance of the monoprotonated
N3[TBA]3 dye mentioned in the previous article. N749, another
representative ruthenium-based sensitizer, which has three carboxylic
acid groups in one tridentate anchoring ligand, was also studied by
Nazeeruddin et al.9 It was shown9 that a cell based on the monoprotonated version
(two TBA+, one H+, complex 3) of N749 series
dyes exhibits the efficiency of 10.4% (under standard light illumination)
which is higher than those of the cells based on triprotonated (complex
1), biprotonated (complex 2), and non-protonated (complex 4) versions.
Apart from the sensitizers containing four (N3) or three (N749) carboxylic
acid anchoring groups, there are a large number of heteroleptic ruthenium
sensitizers containing only one bipyridine anchoring ligand (which
has two carboxylic acid anchoring groups on the ligand).12−18 Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there are only very
few studies19−21 related to the relationships between the degree of
protonation and the physicochemical properties of those heteroleptic
sensitizers, but no detailed systematic study on their relative photovoltaic
performance was reported. We had reported previously that DSC sensitized
with a heteroleptic ruthenium dye containing one TBA+ and
one H+ in the anchoring ligand (named CYC-B11) achieves
the efficiency of 11.5%,3 whereas its full
protonated form (named as CYC-B11H) showed an inferior photovoltaic
performance (PCE of 9.64%).22 However,
the DSC devices were fabricated by different research groups, as a
result, the photovoltaic properties could not be compared directly.
Therefore, systematically studying the function of TBA+ in the heteroleptic Ru sensitizers (containing only two anchoring
groups) on the photovoltaic properties is valuable for designing high
performance heteroleptic Ru dyes for DSC application.

On the
other hand, the effects of the cations in the sensitizers
on the photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding cell have not
been noted appropriately.8−11 There have been so many attempts6,23−29 to investigate the function of cations in the electrolytes, even
though the cations in both dye and electrolyte can adsorb onto TiO2 surface and affect the kinetics/directions of the electron
transfer and band/orbital alignment in the DSCs. We consider that
the influence (on the photovoltaic properties) of the cation from
the sensitizers may not have the same patterns as that from the electrolyte
(even the cations that have the same molecular structure). This is
because the cation from the sensitizer is a part of the dye structure
and will simultaneously contact with TiO2 surface upon
dye loading. Moreover, we had demonstrated previously3 that CYC-B11 is one of the best heteroleptic ruthenium
sensitizers for DSC. To search for better ruthenium sensitizers, the
two 2,2′-bithiophene units in the CYC-B11 ancillary ligand
were replaced by two stronger light-harvesting moieties: 3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene
to obtain DUY11 dye. To study the function of TBA+ systematically,
the remaining one proton in DUY11 is replaced with one TBA+ to give non-protonated DUY12 dye. The fully protonated dye (named
DYE III patented by Wang et al.31 in 2011
with no physicochemical or photovoltaic data reported) was also synthesized
by treating DUY12 with acid. Furthermore, the studies of the effect
of the number of TBA+ ions on the photovoltaic performance
of a sensitizer mentioned above are all focused on the cells under
standard 1 sun illumination. Nevertheless, indoor/weak light applications
have become the important research and development of DSCs, which
show an outstanding performance under room lighting. It is because
DSCs are capable of maintaining a high photovoltage32 and promise an efficient conversion of the photos into
electricity even under weak and diffuse light conditions. The colorful,
flexible, and high-efficiency characteristics of DSCs are very attractive
features for powering wireless sensors and consumer electronics used
indoors. Therefore, understanding the effect of TBA+ ions
on the photovoltaic performance of the ruthenium-based dyes when DSC
is illuminated with modern room lighting such as fluorescent lamps
and LED (light emitting diode)33 is also
very important for designing high-efficient dye for DSC indoor applications.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Structural Characterization
The structures
of the three ruthenium-based sensitizers studied in this article are
presented in Figure 1. For the synthesis of DUY12 sensitizers, a one-pot reaction was
employed as depicted in Scheme S1 of the Supporting Information. Importantly, the coordination-reaction
time decreased to only 30 min by applying microwave heating (the conventional
heating reaction needs 12 h)31 and with
a high yield of 77%. By controlling the protonation of DUY12 with
0.2 HNO3(aq), DYE III and DUY11 were produced in very high
yield (99 and 97%, respectively), the detailed steps for preparing
these three sensitizers can be found in the Supporting Information. The structures of the sensitizers were elucidated
by 1H NMR, HRMS, and elemental analysis (see the Supporting Information). One-proton signals in
the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectra (see Figure S1, Supporting Information) indicates that these
dyes have unsymmetric structures; meaning that two thiocyanate ligands
are in cis-configuration, as shown in Figure 1. While DYE III dissolves only
slightly in organic solvents (such as DMF, EtOH, and DMSO), the presence
of TBA+ in DUY11 and DUY12 gives the sensitizers high solubility
in many common organic solvents (such as CH2Cl2, CHCl3, dioxane, MeCN, DMF, DMSO, acetone, EtOH, and
MeOH) as well as H2O, which facilitates the preparation
of dye solutions for spectroscopic measurements and cell fabrication.
This is one of the advantages for replacing H+ with TBA+ in the ruthenium sensitizers.

DUY11, and DUY12.

Optical Properties
The electronic absorption spectra
of DYE III, DUY11, and DUY12 in ethanol and immobilized on the transparent
(3 μm) TiO2 films are displayed in Figure 2 and the optical data are summarized
in Table S1, Supporting Information. In
ethanol, the absorption profiles of the three sensitizers are very
similar, all have three absorption bands centered at 307, 365, and
540 nm with the absorption threshold up to 700 nm. Generally, the
intense absorption bands at 307 and 365 nm are assigned to intraligand
(π–π*) transitions of the ancillary ligands and
anchoring ligand, respectively, whereas the absorption band at 540
nm is due to the characteristic metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT)
transition.3,38,39 More detailed assignments of the absorption bands are discussed
in the later paragraphs. When the H+ was replaced with
TBA+, the nonbonded electrons on oxygen of the carboxylate
can lift the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) due to their
negative charge but the extension of π-conjugation system will
lower the LUMO of the dye. Thus, the similarity in the energy of the
MLCT bands among three dyes suggests the balance of the above two
influences. This is different from the commonly held view that deprotonation
of the dye molecule induces the blue-shift of the absorption profile.8 It is interesting to note that the enhanced conjugation
length (related to the deprotonation levels) may increase the absorption
coefficient of the sensitizers. Therefore, in ethanol, the absorption
coefficient of DUY12 (contains two TBA+) is higher than
that of DUY11 (contains one TBA+, one H+), which
has stronger absorption compared to DYE III (contains two H+).

Figure 2 The absorption spectra of DYE III, DUY11, and DUY12. (A) Dissolved
in EtOH and (B) anchored on transparent TiO2 films.

Only two broad bands were observed
when these three sensitizers
were immobilized on TiO2 films. The λmax of the lowest-energy band of the dyed films red-shift slightly (∼8
nm) compared to those of the dyes in EtOH (see Figure 2), and the absorption threshold extends to
800 nm. This is probably because there is a slight J-aggregation of the dye molecules when adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. The trend (DYE III > DUY11 > DUY12) of the absorption
intensity
when adsorbed on the TiO2 film is contrary to the trend
(DYE III < DUY11 < DUY12) of their absorption coefficient (when
dissolved in EtOH). This is due to the differences in the dye-loadings
which will be discussed more in the later paragraphs. Furthermore,
the absorption patterns of the three dye-loaded TiO2 although
are nearly alike, the change in the intensity ratio of low-energy
band (EL)/high energy band (EH) for DUY12 when adsorbed on TiO2 is not the
same as that of DYE III or DUY11 loaded on the TiO2 film.
In EtOH, the intensity ratios of EL/EH for DYE III, DUY11, and DUY12 are 0.597, 0.593,
and 0.585, respectively. On the other hand, after adsorbing on TiO2, EL/EH values of 0.862, 0.862, and 0.877 were found for DYE III, DUY11,
and DUY12, respectively. The changes in the EL/EH intensity ratios suggest that
the presence of TBA+ may affect slightly the aggregation
of the sensitizers upon adsorbing on TiO2.

Electrochemical
Properties
The energy levels (EHOMO) of the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) of the three sensitizers measured by square-wave voltammetry
are all close to 0.90 V (vs NHE, see Figure S2, Supporting Information), which is 0.11 V more positive than
the threshold level (∼0.79 V vs NHE)40 for sufficient dye regeneration by the iodide electrolyte. The energy
gaps (Egap) estimated from the onset of
the absorption spectra of the sensitizers in EtOH displayed in Figure 2 are all close to
1.99 eV. The LUMO energy level (ELUMO)
calculated by the formula ELUMO = EHOMO – Egap is −1.09 V (vs NHE), which is 0.59 V more negative than the
TiO2ECB (−0.50 V vs
NHE), providing an efficient driving force for electron injection
from the excited dye to TiO2. The similarity in HOMO and
LUMO energy levels of all three sensitizers indicates that the exchange
of the proton with TBA+ has no influence in the electronic
properties of the sensitizers. Similar phenomenon was also observed
in the case of the CYC-B11 and CYC-B11H couple.3,30 Therefore,
it seems that the difference in the photovoltaic performance of the
three sensitizers containing various numbers of TBA+ does
not depend on the electron-injection or dye-regeneration of the sensitizers.

Theoretical Calculation of the Frontier Molecular Orbital Distributions
and Electronic Transitions
Because of the trivial influence
of alkyl chains on the orbital distributions41,42 and the very similar absorption profiles (see Figure 2) of the three sensitizers, both in EtOH
and adsorbed on TiO2, density functional theory (DFT) and
time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were performed only on DYE
III. The calculated results can be extended to qualitatively assess
the frontier orbital distributions and transition states for all three
sensitizers. The first ten calculated frontier orbitals distribution
of DYE III are illustrated in Figure S3, Supporting Information. The data show that the ancillary ligands have
significant contribution to the first five occupied orbitals, whereas
the ruthenium metal is only related to the first three occupied orbitals.
Furthermore, the unoccupied orbitals mainly come from the anchoring
ligand (except LUMO + 3 which has some contribution from the ancillary
ligand), providing an efficient pathway for the electron to inject
from the excited sensitizer into the TiO2 conduction band
via an anchoring ligand. These orbital distributions indicate that
the ligand-to-ligand charge-transfer (LLCT) transitions may be also
important for the light-harvesting ability of the sensitizer. The
lowest-energy bands in the absorption spectra (see Figure 2) originated from the mixed
metal/LLCT [(M/L)LCT] transitions, not solely from the metal-to-ligand
charge-transfer (MLCT) transition as reported in several ruthenium
sensitizers.38,43 The HOMO locates on the ruthenium
and two thiocyanate ligands; therefore, when the sensitizer was oxidized
after absorbing the photo and injecting the electron to TiO2, the dye cation with a β-LUSO (β-lowest unoccupied spin
orbital, which is the regeneration site of the dye cation)44 was placed on the ruthenium and two thiocyanate
ligands (see Figure S4, Supporting Information). The β-LUSO significantly distributes on the two soft sulfur
atoms of the thiocyanate ligands along with the HOMO energy that is
0.11 V more positive than the redox potential of I2•–/I– couple guaranteeing efficient
dye-regeneration. Combining the large dye absorption coefficient,
the devices based on the three dyes were expected to exhibit high JSC values.

The experimental and calculated
absorption spectra along with the calculated oscillator strengths
(f) and the electron density difference maps of DYE
III dye are displayed in Figure S5, Supporting Information. The calculated transition assignments are summarized
in Table S2, Supporting Information. The
calculated absorption spectrum is quite close to the experimental
absorption spectrum, implying that the TD-DFT calculated data can
be used to explain the electron transitions in these three sensitizers.
The S3, S4, S5, and S13 transitions composed of both metal-to-ligand
and ligand-to-ligand charge transitions are the evidence to support
that the lowest-energy band (∼540 nm) originates from the (M/L)LCT
transitions but not from solely the MLCT transition. The origin of
the S24, S27, and S38 transitions suggests that the middle energy
band (∼365 nm) contains also the (M/L)LCT transition, even
though the contribution of LLCT is superior to the (M/L)LCT transition.
On the other hand, the highest-energy band (∼307 nm) is assigned
simply to the π → π* transition of the anchoring
ligand.3,38 The transitions S3, S4, S5, S24, S27, and
S38 all contribute to the photocurrent production when applied in
DSC because these transitions are from the metal/ligand to the anchoring
ligand when the dye molecules are excited by photos. Transition S13
having 23% from the HOMO to the LUMO + 4 (which locates mainly on
the anchoring ligand) also contributes to the photocurrent production.
From the oscillator strengths of these positive transitions, high
current density of the cell based on these dyes is expected.

Photovoltaic
Performance of the DSCs Sensitized by Three Dyes
under Standard 1 Sun Illumination
To study the function of
TBA+ in the anchoring ligand on the photovoltaic performance
of the sensitizers, iodide electrolytes containing various amounts
(0, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 M) of 4-tert-butylpyridine
(TBP) were used for the first try because TBP has the function similar
to TBA+ in the sense of TiO2 surface protection.
The purpose of this study is to see if TBA+ can totally
replace TBP in the electrolyte to improve the cell photovoltaic performance.
The photovoltaic parameters of the resulting cells are summarized
in Table 1. In general,
the Jsc of the cells decreases when the
concentration of TBP in the electrolyte increases for all three sensitizers.
It is probably due to TBP hindering dye regeneration by blocking the
electrolyte to contact the oxidized dyes or increasing the viscosity
of the electrolyte solution, slowing down the I3– diffusion. Or TBP reduces the electron injection driving force because
it raises the TiO2ECB. The
effect of TBP on the Voc of the cells
for the three sensitizers is not the same. The DYE III (containing
no TBA+ ions)-based cell has higher Voc when the electrolyte contains more TBP due to the better
protection of TiO2 surface by TBP. As a result the highest
efficiency cell was obtained when 0.5 M TBP was presented in the electrolyte
solution. On the other hand, the highest efficiency of the DUY12 (containing
two TBA+ ions) dyed cell was found when the electrolyte
solution contains 0.3 M TBP. The data prove that TBA+ in
a sensitizer can function as TBP additive in the electrolyte to reduce
the charge recommendation by protecting the uncovered TiO2 surface. On the other hand, the side-effect of the adsorbed TBP,
which raises the TiO2 conduction band and decreases the Jsc of the cell, will not occur in TBA+. This function of TBA+ is important especially when the
dye molecule has high LUMO energy level. Furthermore, the absorption
data illustrated in Figure 2A show that dye-contained TBA+ has higher absorption
coefficient than the analogue-contained H+ due to the enhanced
conjugation length (related to the deprotonation). This is also the
advantage of replacing H+ by TBA+ in dye molecules.
Nevertheless, TBP mended the uncovered TiO2 surface after
the dye molecules were loaded; therefore, it will not affect the dye-loading
but TBA+, which adsorbed on TiO2 with dye molecules
simultaneously, will lower the dye-loading, and decrease the Jsc of the DSC. The photovoltaic data listed
in Table 1 clearly
reveal the dilemma of using sensitizers containing TBA+. As a result, the best photovoltaic performance dye with two anchoring
groups was generally the one containing one TBA+ and one
H+ (compared to those having two TBA+ or two
H+).

Data
displayed in Table 1 also indicated that the function of TBA+ ion in
the dye molecule is very close to TBP additive in the electrolyte
in the sense of TiO2 protection Therefore, after optimizing
the TBP concentration in the electrolyte, the highest efficiency of
cells based on three sensitizers are very close under the standard
light illumination (see Table 1). Replacing the acidic H+ in the sensitizer with
TBA+ provides an alternative method to optimize cell performance
with less amount of TBP used. DUY11 containing one H+ and
one TBA+ was used as a sensitizer to optimize the thickness
of the TiO2 films because the previous reports3,12−22 indicate that a ruthenium sensitizer containing one TBA+ ion generally has the highest efficiency among other H+/TBA+ analogues. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices
using the various thicknesses of TiO2 photoanodes are summarized
in Table 2. The data
showed that JSC increases with increasing
(from 12 to 18 μm) TiO2 film thickness because a
thicker TiO2 film loads more dye molecules and thus, leads
to the enhancement in the photocurrent of the cell. Nevertheless,
the increasing of TiO2 film thickness (TiO2 is
an insulator) results in the increase in the series resistance of
the cell,45 therefore, both VOC and FF of the cell decrease (see Table 2). Moreover, further increasing the TiO2 thickness (up to 22 μm) leads to a decrease in the
efficiency of the cell because of the poor quality of thick TiO2 film. Overall, the optimal TiO2 thickness is 18
μm, and the highest efficiency of DUY11-sensitized DSC is up
to 11.47%.

The same fabrication condition except
the concentration of TBP
in the electrolyte (0.5 M for DYE III, 0.3 M for DUY12, the optimal

based on DYE III and DUY12 dyes, and the J–V and IPCE curves of devices sensitized by the three dyes
under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight are displayed in Figure 3. The photovoltaic parameters,
dye-loading, and dye absorption (dye-loading times dye absorption
coefficient) are collected in Table 3. DSCs based on DYE III and DUY12 achieve the PCE of
10.76 and 10.88%, respectively, whereas the N719-based cell exhibits
an efficiency of only 9.95%. The differences in the photovoltaic performance
between them result from the content of TBA+ in the dye
molecules. TBA+ also occupies the TiO2 surface,
leading to the lower dye-loading (DYE III > DUY11 > DUY12) as
seen
in the data listed in Table 3. However, DUY12 has higher absorption coefficient (ε)
than DUY11 and DYE III. As a result, the dye absorption (dye loading
time absorption coefficient) on the practical photoanode is DUY11
> DUY12 > DYE III. Overall, the lower dye-loading of DUY11 was
compensated
by its higher absorption coefficient, consequently, DUY11-sensitized
DSC has the highest efficiency.

DUY12-dyed TiO2 has higher dye absorption compared to
DYE III-adsorbed TiO2; however, the corresponding cell
has lower Jsc. DUY12 with both H+ ions substituted by TBA+ ions and no acidic H+ to lower the ECB of TiO2 when
adsorbed, the electron injection of the resulting DSC has less efficiency,
resulting in lower Jsc.46 TBA+ in a sensitizer can reduce the Voc loss by protecting the TiO2 surface,
and DSC based on DUY12 containing two TBA+ shows the highest VOC. As a result, the overall conversion efficiency
(10.88%) of the DUY12 dyed cell is lower than that of the DUY11-sensitized
cell but close to that of the cell based on DYE III.

The IPCE
curves of the DSCs sensitized with three dyes illustrated
in Figure 3B revealed
that the IPCE values of the DUY12-based cell is obviously lower than
the cells based on the other two dyes at almost the whole wavelength,
consistent with the order of the Jsc values
obtained from the I–V measurements.
Overall, considering the solubility and photovoltaic performance,
the optimal structure of the ruthenium dye with two anchoring groups
is the one containing one H+ and one TBA+ ions.
This study reveals that just like the thiocyanate ruthenium sensitizer
containing three (e.g., N749)10,11 or four (e.g., N3)9 carboxylate anchoring groups, the best photovoltaic
performance dye with two anchoring groups (e.g., DYE III series) is
also probably the one having one H+ and one TBA+ ions, although the difference in the efficiency is not significant.

Charge-Transfer Kinetics of the Devices
Nyquist plots
(under illumination and in dark) of electrochemical impedance spectra
(EIS) for the cells sensitized by the three ruthenium dyes are displayed
in Figure 4. The TiO2/dye/electrolyte interfacial (R2) and series (Rs) resistances extracted
from EIS are also summarized in Table 3. Under illumination, the trend of the R2 value is in the order of DYE III (18.6 Ω) <
DUY11 (18.9 Ω) < DUY12 (19.5 Ω), even though the energies
of the frontier orbitals for these three dyes are very close. The
smaller interfacial resistance, R2, indicates
more facile electron injection and dye regeneration in the cells.47 The more facile electron injection and dye regeneration
of the DYE III-based cell is because DYE III contains higher number
of acidic H+ that lowers the TiO2ECB upon adsorbing on it, thus increasing the driving force
for the electron injection. On the other hand, in dark, the interfacial
resistance (R2) represents the coverage
of TiO2 surface: the higher the R2 value, the better the TiO2 coverage. Interestingly,
the R2 order (DYE III (256 Ω) <
DUY11 (294 Ω) < DUY12 (304 Ω), see Table 3) measured in dark is the same
as that under illumination. The sensitizer containing more TBA+ ions exhibits larger interfacial resistance, supporting the
fact that TBA+ adsorbed on TiO2 surface can
block the electron transfer from TiO2 to I3– in the electrolyte, reduce the charge recombination,
resulting in high Voc of the cell.

Figure 4 EIS (Nyquist
plots) of DYE III-, DUY11-, and DUY12-sensitized cells
(A) under standard 1 Sunlight and (B) in dark.

The light intensity-related electron transport time (τtr, the time taken by the electrons on TiO2 transiting
across the photoanode) and electron lifetime (τn,
also called charge recombination time, the time taken by the electrons
on TiO2 to recombine with the oxidant in the electrolyte)
extracted from the intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS)
and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), respectively,
are displayed in Figure 5. The electron transport times of all cells are more than one order
of magnitude shorter than the electron lifetime, allowing the electron
to transport to the photoanode before recombining with the oxidant
in the electrolyte.25 That is why the cells
sensitized by these three dyes all have PCE over 10%. The electron
transport time (τtr) provides the information regarding
the number of injected electrons in the TiO2 conduction
band and the quality (resistance) of the TiO2 film. The
τtr values for the cells based on DYE III are very
close to that of DUY11 cell at all light intensities measured. Supposing
the quality of the TiO2 films is pretty much the same,
the similar τtr value suggests that the number of
injected electrons in the TiO2 conduction band for DYE
III- and DUY11-dyed cells is also very close. The τtr value of DUY12-based cell is slightly lower than the other two dyes
sensitized cells, resulting in lower Jsc. The trend of the electron lifetime (τn) for the
three cells is in ascending order of DYE III < DUY11 < DUY12
(see Figure 5B). Longer
τn value suggests the cell with less charge recombination
(or better TiO2 surface coverage). The dye-loading is in
descending order of DYE III > DUY11 > DUY12 (see Table 3). DUY12 has the lowest dye-loading,
but it covers the TiO2 surface more completely (by the
assistance of TBA+); the corresponding cell has the longest
τn value, and therefore has the highest Voc (see Table 3). The electron lifetime data reaffirmed the importance of
TBA+ in dye molecules to reduce the charge recombination
by adsorbing on TiO2 surface. Nevertheless, TBA+ cannot lower the Fermi level of TiO2 anode as efficiently
as H+ does and decrease the dye loading by occupying TiO2 surface, resulting in lower Jsc. If the LUMO level of the ruthenium dyes can be raised without sacrificing
too much light-harvesting ability, the benefit of TBA+ will
be more manifest.

Photovoltaic Performance of the DSCs Sensitized by Three Dyes
under Room-Light Illumination
Indoor lighting conditions
are very different compared with the solar irradiance outdoors both
in the light intensity and spectrum response. In general, indoor illumination
has an intensity between 200 and 2000 lux with major visible light.
On the other hand, the intensity of a full solar irradiation (having
ca. 45% NIR and IR photos48) is 100 mW
cm–2 (AM 1.5G), corresponding to about 100 000–110 000
lux. Therefore, the sensitizer designed for outdoor and indoor application
may not be totally the same. Nevertheless, only few reports (including
iodide-based electrolytes in combination with a ruthenium-based dye,49−51 or copper electrolyte coupled with organic dyes52) exist that focus on designing the sensitizers to be used
for indoor-light harvesting. It is valuable to know the function of
TBA+ in the sensitizers when indoor DSC application is
addressed.

The absorption spectra of DYE III, DUY11, and DUY12
immobilized on TiO2 and the emission spectra of the indoor
lighting (T5 fluorescent and LED lights) overlap in a broad wavelength
range from 300 to 800 nm (see Figure S6, Supporting Information).32 It is expected that
the cells under room-lighting will have higher PCE compared to those
under the irradiation of standard AM 1.5G sunlight. To investigate
the function of TBA+ ion in dye molecules for indoor DSC
application, we test the photovoltaic performance of the DSCs under
LED lighting. The PCEs of the DYE III-, DUY11-, DUY12-, and N719-sensitized
cells under LED light illumination with various intensities are illustrated
in Figure 6. The detailed
photovoltaic parameters and the original I–V curves are displayed in Tables S3–S6 (Supporting Information) and Figures S7–S10
(Supporting Information), respectively.
The PCE of all cells is higher at stronger (LED) light intensity (between
400 and 6000 lux studied in this article). The DUY11-sensitized cell
(which has the best photovoltaic performance at standard 1 sun illumination)
also has the highest PCE under all studied light intensities. The
DUY11-based cell exhibits the PCE up to 19% at ca. 1000 lux of LED
lighting. This promises the applications of DSCs under room lighting
conditions. It is interesting to note here that under LED light, DSC
sensitized with DUY12 (containing two TBA+ in the anchoring
groups) has higher PCE than the DYE III (contains no TBA+ ion)-based cell, although these two cells have similar PCE value
under standard 1 sun illumination. Under weak light illumination (when
the number of the excited electrons is small), protection of TiO2 surface to avoid the charge recombination and keeping the
high TiO2 Fermi-level (by adsorbed less protons) to achieve
high Voc are more important than under
strong light illumination. TBA+ performs its functions
(protects TiO2 surface without changing its fermi-level)
nicely along this line. This could be the reason that under LED illumination,
the PCE of DUY12 cell is obviously higher than that of DYE III cell.
Furthermore, the TBA+ ion in the sensitizer and sensitizer
anion may undergo synergistic interactions in the adsorbed state as
the optical data shown in Figure 2B and the corresponding discussion in the previous
paragraph. Thus, TBA+ may suppress unfavorable dye aggregation
after adsorbing on TiO2 to reduce the charge recombination.52

Figure 6 PCE of the DSCs sensitized by DYE III, DUY11, DUY12, and
N719 dyes
under the illumination of LED light at various intensities.

In conclusion, three thiocyanate
ruthenium complexes (named as
DYE III, DUY11, and DUY12) with two H+, one H+, one TBA+, and two TBA+ in the bidentated
anchoring groups were synthesized by an efficient one-pot reaction
with microwave assistance. At standard AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm2 condition, DSCs sensitized by DYE III, DUY11, and DUY12 exhibited
excellent conversion efficiencies of 10.76, 11.47, and 10.88%, respectively;
all are higher than that (9.95%) of the N719-based cell. Replacing
the acidic H+ with TBA+ in dye molecules can
reduce the unwanted charge recombination by avoiding dye aggregation
and protecting TiO2 surface without significantly affecting
(compared to proton) the ECB of TiO2 when used in DSCs. Nevertheless, TBA+ also occupies
the TiO2 surface to lower the dye loading, decreasing the Jsc. As a result, the highest efficiency device
is the one sensitized by the dye containing one H+ and
one TBA+ (such as DUY11 in this study). The DUY11-based
device also exhibits the highest overall efficiency (PCE of 19% at
ca. 1000 lux) under LED illumination at various intensities. Furthermore,
under LED lighting, the DSC based on DUY12 (with two TBA+) has higher PCE compared to that dyed by DYE III (contains two H+); even these two dyes have similar photovoltaic performance
under standard 1 sun light. The result reveals the important role
of TBA+ in TiO2 surface protection under room
lighting condition (when small number of electrons were excited by
the weak light). This study provided another point (replacing TBA+ with H+ in dye molecule) in molecular engineering
of ruthenium-based sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells, especially
in indoor environments. We expect that our study will have a practical
impact in designing new high-efficient sensitizers to harvest the
ambient light energy to power electronic devices or to extend their
battery lifetime for the autonomously operated electric devices.

Experimental Section
Materials and Measurements
All reagents
were obtained
from the commercial resources and used as received unless specified.
Solvents were dried over 4 Å molecular sieves before use. Nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker 500 MHz
NMR spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained
using a JMS-700 MStation Mass Spectrometer. Elemental analyses were
carried out with a PerkinElmer 2400 CHNS/O analyzer. UV–vis
spectra were measured using a Cary 300 Bio spectrometer. Voltammetric
measurements were performed in a single-compartment, three-electrode
cell with a Pt wire counter electrode and a platinum disk working
electrode. The reference electrode was Ag+/Ag, and the
supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAClO4) in DMF. The square-wave voltammograms (potential step increment:
5 mV; frequency: 25 Hz) of sensitizers dissolved in EtOH were recorded
using a Potentiostat/Galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie,
the Netherlands), and ferrocene was used as an internal calibration
standard. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements
were carried out using an Eco Chemie Autolab PGSTAT30 Potentiostat/Galvanostat
in 50 mV voltage steps with a sinusoidal potential perturbation of
10 mV in dark or under illumination with simulated sunlight. IMPS
and IMVS were recorded with a Zahner Zennium controlled intensity
modulated photospectroscopy CIMPS-1 potentiostat installed with a
light intensity modulated function. The measurements of EIS, IMPS,
and IMVS as well as the relative calculations can be found in our
previous articles.30,34

DFT Calculation
All computational calculations were
performed using the Gaussian 09 program similar to our previous report.35

Device Fabrication and Photovoltaic Performance
Characterization
A 19 μm (or 15 μm or 9 or 5.5
μm) TiO2 layer (purchased from Taiwan DSC PV (TDP),
Taiwan) and a 3 μm
scattered layer of anatase TiO2 (400 nm in diameter, prepared
in our laboratory) were deposited sequentially on a fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass using screen printing to make the
photoanode. After sintering at 500 °C for 4 h, the TiO2 film was immersed into a solution of 0.2 mM sensitizer containing
20 mM CDCA as a co-adsorbent in a mixture of acetonitrile/isopropanol/DMSO
(volume ratio 1:1:3) for 14 h at room temperature. The platinum counter
electrode was made through a typical thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 onto a FTO glass. The two electrodes were
assembled and sealed with a 25 μm thick Surlyn spacer. A solution
of 0.05 M LiI, 1.0 M butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.03
M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), and TBP (0,
0.3, 0.5, or 0.7 M) in a mixture of acetonitrile/valeronitrile (volume
ratio = 85:15) was used as the electrolyte for the devices. The cell
active area is 0.16 cm2 obtained by using a dark mask.
Other detailed processes for TiO2 film preparation and
device fabrication can be found in our previous article.3 The dye loading was estimated by desorbing the
dye molecules from the TiO2 practical photoanode with a
solution of 0.05 M TBAOH in EtOH and then the corresponding UV–vis
spectra were used for quantitative analysis.

For photovoltaic
characterization under indoor lighting, a LED (Innotec Inc. Taiwan,
LUX-T14401AL/NT8) light source was used. Irradiation from the artificial
light sources is generally expressed in photometric units (lux, illuminance)
rather than radiometric ones (W/m2, irradiance) to represent
the light intensity. By measuring the radiant flux and the luminous
flux of the lamp, the luminous efficacy conversion factor (incident
illuminance/incident irradiance) was calculated, being 302 ±
3 lm/W for our measuring system. This value was then used to evaluate
the efficiency of the PV devices. The illuminance was appraised by
a luxmeter (Optimum optoelectronics Corp., Taiwan, SRI2000F). Current–voltage
(I–V) measurements under
LED illumination were performed in a customized designed iron box
(0.65 m x 0.7 m x 2.0 m) composed of height-tunable lift with black
walls inside and a 4 lamps holder incorporated at the top and four
supporting plates underneath along the vertical axis. The incident
power density was adjusted by the distance between the top lamps and
the supporting (sample) plate. The spectroradiometer was placed on
the supporting plate for measuring light intensity, then the DSC was
placed at the same place for taking I–V curves via a computer-controlled digital source meter
(Keithley 2400, USA). After I–V measurements, the spectroradiometer was placed back to the supporting
plate for checking the variation in the light intensity. The door
was kept closed during I–V measurements to avoid the ingress of light from outside. It is worth
mentioning that 1 sun radiation, that is 1000 W/m2 AM1.5G,
corresponds to an illuminance of 100 000–110 000
lux.36,37 The light bulb employed in our system, namely
LED, presents irradiance which is two orders of magnitude smaller
than that at STC and narrower emission spectra with minor components
in the IR range. Thus, the source of heat which affect the PV device
efficiency is very small during indoor-lighting.
