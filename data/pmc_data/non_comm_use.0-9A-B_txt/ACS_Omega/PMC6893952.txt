The amphiphilic graphene derivative
was prepared by covalent grafting
of graphene oxide (GO) with isophorone diisocyanate and N,N-dimethylethanolamine and then noncovalent grafting
of GO with sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate. The results obtained from
infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric
analysis, and X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the short chains
were successfully grafted onto the surface of GO. Subsequently, scanning
electron microscopy and optical microscopy results showed that the
modified GO (IP-GO) has the best dispersibility and compatibility
than GO and reduced GO in the waterborne polyurethane matrix. The
relationship between the corrosion resistance of composite coatings
and the dispersibility of the graphene derivative and the compatibility
of the graphene derivative with a polymer matrix were discussed. The
anticorrosive properties were characterized by electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy analysis and salt spray tests. Through a series of anticorrosion
tests, it is concluded that the anticorrosion performance of a composite
coating with 0.3 wt % IP-GO is significantly improved. The excellent
anticorrosion performance is due to the perfect dispersion and good
compatibility of IP-GO in waterborne polyurethane.

1 Introduction
Corrosion
of metal surface, particularly oil pipeline, coastal
transmission tower, ships, and other metal equipment, has an urgent
need for anticorrosion. Every year, because of metal maintenance,
it consumes a lot of workforce and resources.1−3 Electrochemical
corrosion is one of the most common corrosion techniques for metals,
which occurs at the interface of metal-electrolyte solutions. In order
to prevent the corrosive substances (i.e., H2O, O2, and Cl–) from corroding the surface of the metal,
the anticorrosion coatings (i.e., waterborne epoxy resin and waterborne
polyurethane) have been often used for metal protection because of
its physical barrier properties.4−7 With the increasing awareness of environmental protection,
the strict control of volatile organic substances and harmful air
pollutants by laws issued by various countries, the world coating
industry is moving in the fast lane of water-based, solvent-free,
and green development.8,9 Waterborne polyurethane (WPU)
using water as a solvent has been widely accepted in the anticorrosion
coating due to its excellent adhesion, chemical resistance, eco-friendliness,
and good weathering resistance.10,11

However, the
corrosive agents cannot be completely blocked by the
organic coating, and more or less corrosive agents will enter the
metal/coating interface. Therefore, attempts have been made to blend
the modified organic coatings in many ways to provide better shielding
against corrosive media. Addition of impermeable nanoparticles including
Al2O3, ZnO, clay, graphene, and boron nitride
into an epoxy coating as corrosive barrier substance media has been
extensively discussed.12−15 These results have proven that the addition of nanoparticles could
improve the barrier efficiency of organic coatings against corrosive
media.

Graphene (Gr), a two-dimensional graphitic carbon material,
is
considered to be one of the most attractive materials, which has attracted
enormous research interests in the reinforcement of composite materials
for its remarkable performance, such as higher aspect ratio, low density,
excellent mechanical strength,16 high thermal
conductivity,17 and outstanding barrier
property.18 In addition, graphene with
the flexible surface performance19,20 can be used
as a new barrier filler in corrosion-resistant polymer systems instead
of the traditional scaly fillers. Because of the above advanced properties,
Gr was more and more used in the field of achieving high efficiency
corrosion resistance of composite coatings. Up to now, it has been
reported that graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD-Gr)
is a superior anticorrosion coating.21 Nevertheless,
CVD-Gr coating cannot be used as a long-term anticorrosion barrier
because it is not able to prevent the metal corrosion once defects
and cracks occur in the atomically thin materials.22,23 It is unrealistic to prepare large-area defect-free graphene. Therefore,
the use of graphene and its derivatives to enhance organic coatings
is another effectual technique to achieve outstanding barrier properties.
However, due to graphene and its derivatives, high aspect ratio, strong
intermolecular forces, and easy agglomeration in the polymer limit
their practical applications.19,24,25

In order to improve the dispersibility of graphene or graphene
oxide (GO) in a polymer matrix, many methods have been tried to modify
the surface of Gr, GO, or reduced GO (RGO) to improve their chemical
affinity.18,26−30 Gr or GO has been treated by ultrasonic dispersion,
in situ polymerization reduction, and chemical modification to enable
better dispersion in the polymer matrix.31−34 Li et al.5 reported that graphene oxide modified with a titanate coupling agent
exhibited self-alignment when a certain amount was added to the aqueous
polyurethane, and the corrosion resistance was remarkably improved.
Therefore, improving the dispersion and compatibility of graphene
derivatives in polymers plays an important role in enhancing the properties
of polymers.

The purpose of this investigation is to use GO
nanosheets as a
corrosion inhibitor filler in the WPU coating. For the sake of improving
the dispersion and compatibility of GO in WPU, isophorone diisocyanate
(IPDI) and N,N-dimethylethanolamine
(DMEA) were covalently grafted onto GO to prepare modified graphene
oxide (IP-GO), and a small amount of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate
(SDBS) was used to graft IP-GO noncovalently. The waterborne polyurethane
functionalized graphene composite anticorrosive coating was prepared
and coated on a Q235 steel plate. Compared to the GO and RGO reinforced
coating, the coating with a 0.3% high aspect ratio of functionalized
graphene has the best anticorrosion effect.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
The ordinary carbon structural
steels (Q235) were purchased from Baosteel Ltd. (China). Q235 steel
panels were cut into a certain shape (80 mm × 40 mm × 1
mm). Before coating formation, the Q235 steel plate substrates were
treated with a degreaser and ethanol in succession and then dried
by nitrogen gas. Dibutyltin dilaurate (≥99.5%) and vitamin
C (≥99.8%) were purchased from Guangdong Wengjiang Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd. (China) and Tianjin Guangfu Technology Development
Co., Ltd. (China), respectively. N,N-Dimethylethanolamine (99%) was purchased from Tianjin Comemi Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). IPDI (99%) and SDBS were purchased from
Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (China). Natural graphite
flake (99.95%) was purchased from Shanghai Yifan Graphite Co., Ltd.
(China). KMnO4 (99.5%), H2SO4 (98%),
NaNO3, H2O2 (30%), ammonia solution
(25%), acetone (99.7%), and hydrochloric acid (37%) were bought from
Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). Waterborne polyurethane
(NeoRez R-9679) with a solid content of 37% was purchased from DSM
(Netherlands).

2.2 Synthesis of GO and Reduced
Graphene Oxide
GO was prepared by a strong oxidizing reaction
through a modified
Hummers’ method.35,36 Briefly, graphite flake
(2.0 g) and NaNO3 were dispersed in 200 mL of H2SO4 in a beaker under constant stirring in an ice-water
bath. After 30 min, 9.0 g of KMnO4 was tardily added to
the mixture while keeping the temperature below 10 °C for an
hour. The solution was stirred at 45 °C for 10 h. Then, 250 mL
of deionized water was tardily added to the mixture; afterward, the
mixture was heated to 90 °C and maintained at this temperature
for 1.5 h. When the system was cooled down to 50–60 °C,
35 mL of H2O2 was added slowly. The mixture
was cleaned twice with dilute hydrochloric acid and then continuously
centrifuged with a large amount of deionized water until the pH reached
6–7. Then, a stable and homogeneous GO aqueous solution (3.3
mg/mL) was obtained by bath ultrasonication exfoliation. Finally,
a GO powder was obtained by freeze-drying.

Reduced graphene
oxide was successfully obtained by using a nontoxic and harmless chemical
reduction method. Deionized water (60 mL) was added to the GO aqueous
solution, and GO dispersion (2 mg/mL) was prepared by an ultrasonic
bath for 1 h. Then, vitamin C (6 g) was progressively added and hereafter
was placed in a constant temperature water bath at 85 °C by continuous
stirring with a magnetic stirrer for 8 h, vacuum filtration, freeze-drying,
and the resulting sample was labeled RGO.

2.3 Synthesis
of IP-GO
IP-GO was obtained
by a method of in situ polymerization. Typically, GO (0.7 g) was added
into 200 mL of acetone and ultrasonically dispersed for 1 h. Then,
the dispersion was transferred to a three-neck flask, and 80 g of
IPDI and 0.01 g of dibutyltin dilaurate were added and reacted under
vigorous electromagnetic stirring and nitrogen gas refluxing at 85
°C for 12 h. The temperature was lowered to 70 °C, and then
25 g of DMEA was added to the mixture for 1.5 h. The impurities were
washed away with acetone and deionized water, and the product obtained
by freeze-drying was named IP-GO. The procedure of the synthesis of
IP-GO is schematically shown in Figure 1.

graphene oxide (IP-GO) and coatings. (a) Graphite flake. (b) GO. (c)
IP-GO. (d) Composite coatings on metal.

2.4 Preparation of the Composite Coatings
IP-GO
(0.03 g) was dispersed with SDBS (0.03 g) in 8.5 mL of alcohol
solution (5 wt %) and ultrasonically dispersed for 1 h, and then 10
g of WPU was added and stirred vigorously for 1 h with a magnetic
stirrer. Then, WPU coatings with a solid content of 20% were obtained.
The WPU composite coatings reinforced by GO, RGO, and IP-GO were named
GO/WPU, RGO/WPU, and IP-GO/WPU coating, respectively. The Q235 steel
were ultrasonically cleaned in a degreaser for 10 min and flushed
with absolute ethanol for another 30 min. The reinforced WPU was coated
on the surface of the Q235 steel (80 mm × 40 mm × 1 mm)
by bar coating and air-dried for 2 h and then transferred to a vacuum
oven and baked at 110 °C for 30 min.

2.5 Characterizations
The GO, RGO, and
synthesized IP-GO was characterized by Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy (TENSOR 37, Germany) over a wavelength range
of 400–4000 cm–1 and X-ray diffraction (XRD;
D8 DISCOVER, BRUKER, Germany). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; STA409PC,
Germany) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature
to 700 °C under a N2 atmosphere and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS; K-Aepna, USA) were introduced to further demonstrate
the chemical composition of GO, RGO, and IP-GO. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM; TECNAI-20) were used to characterize the morphology
of GO and P-GO. For TEM, the sample was dispersed in water to form
a light yellow colloidal dispersion with a concentration of approximately
0.005 wt % and then dripped onto a microgrid and carbon support film.
Laser confocal Raman spectroscopy (Raman; XploRA PLUS, Japan) was
used to analyze the structures of GO and IP-GO.

Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S4800, Japan) was used to observe the cross
section of the composite coating after brittle fracture in liquid
nitrogen and to analyze the microdispersion of GO, RGO, and IP-GO
nanosheets in the polymer. An optical microscope (OLYMPUS BX43, Japan)
was used to analyze the dispersion of graphene derivatives in the
polymer. The mechanical performance of the composite was tested by
a universal testing machine (GMT4000, MTS Systems Co. Ltd., China).

The electrochemical corrosion measurement was performed in a 3.5
wt % NaCl solution by a three-electrode cell electrochemical workstation
(CS350H, China). The electrochemical workstation comprises Pt wire,
saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and Q235 steel (exposed area, 1
cm2) as the counter electrode, reference electrode, and
working electrode, respectively. Electrochemical testing was started
after testing for 1 h after OCP (open-circuit potential), and other
systems were stabilized. For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), the frequency range of 10 kHz to 0.1 Hz with a perturbation
amplitude of 10 mV was used. The salt spray test was carried out on
coated Q235 plates (40 mm × 80 mm) with a 5 wt % NaCl solution
at 100% relative humidity at 35 °C according to ASTM B117-03.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization
of Functionalized GO Nanosheets
TGA, XPS, XRD, and FT-IR
were used to demonstrate the successful
grafting of IPDI and DMEA to the edge and surface of GO. The GO surface
includes a large amount of oxygen-containing functional groups, which
provides reactive sites for IPDI. A schematic representation of the
characterization of IPDI and DMEA grafted onto the GO surface is displayed
in Figure 1. TGA was
used to analyze the thermal stability of the GO, RGO, and IP-GO. The
results obtained from TGA measurements can also be used to analyze
the amount of IPDI and DMEA chains grafted onto GO sheets, as shown
in Figure 2a. The weight
loss of more than 35% was observed in the range of 50–300 °C
for GO. Furthermore, there was a significant weight reduction when
the temperature increased to 200 °C. This reduction was primarily
the result of unstable oxygen-containing groups decomposing into CO2 or other vapors. The hydroxyl carboxyl and epoxy groups on
the edge and surface of the RGO were removed, so RGO exhibited high
thermal stability with a mass loss of about 26.2% at a temperature
below 700 °C. IP-GO showing lower loss than GO at 50–330
°C due to the polymer chains grafted on the GO surface replaced
the thermal instability of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups and alleviated
the rate of thermal decomposition. However, at temperatures above
330 °C, the thermal loss of IP-GO is much higher than GO, which
is mainly due to the thermal decomposition of polymer chains grafted
on the GO surface. The residual carbon rate of GO was 48.21%, while
that of IP-GO was significantly reduced (39.02%). It is also proved
that the grafting reaction did take place in GO lamellae during the
modification process. In addition, compared with the initial decomposition
temperature of TGA, the thermal stability of surface groups of GO
modified by IPDI and DMEA was greatly improved. Molecular chains were
successfully grafted onto oxygen-containing groups of GO, which significantly
increased the initial thermal decomposition temperature of GO.

Figure 2 Characterization
of GO, RGO, and IP-GO by (a) TGA and (b) FT-IR
spectra analysis and (c) XRD analysis of graphite, GO, and IP-GO.

The GO treated with IPDI and DMEA can be derivatized
by forming
an amide bond and a urethane bond with the hydroxyl group at the edge
and the surface oxygen-containing groups, respectively.37,38 The formation of new chemical bonds of these chemical changes about
GO and modified GO derivatives that exhibit characteristic IR spectra
can be analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy. Figure 2b displays the spectra of GO, RGO, and IP-GO.
In the infrared absorption spectra of GO, a high absorption band at
1720 cm–1 corresponding to the C=O stretching
of a carboxyl group appears and the O–H deformation vibration
appears at 1380 cm–1. The resonance at 1610 cm–1 may result from two aspects: for one thing, it can
be attributed to the stretching of the adsorbed water molecules, and
for another, it may contain the deformation vibration of C=C.39−41 A broad and intense adsorption at about 3420 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of −OH groups on
the GO surface. The characteristic peaks of RGO are weakened after
being reduced.

Compared to GO, some new characteristic IR spectra
appeared in
IP-GO after treatment with IPDI and DMEA. Compared with the C=O
characteristic peaks (1720 cm–1) in GO, the C=O
characteristic peaks in IP-GO move to a low wavenumber, which can
be attributed to the interaction stretching between the carbamate
bond of C=O on the surface of IP-GO and the carbonyl group
in the carboxyl group. The new stretch at 1640 cm–1 corresponds to an amide carbonyl-stretching mode (the so-called
amide I vibration stretch). The band peak at 1540 cm–1 can be assigned to carbamate esters and the coupling of the C–N
stretching vibration with the CHN deformation vibration (the so-called
amide II vibration stretch).42 The new
peak at 2950 cm–1 is attributed to the methyl group
(C–H, from N,N-dimethylethanolamine)
stretching vibrations. The new adsorption peaks at 1240 and 1050 cm–1 can be assigned to the C–N stretching. Obviously,
FT-IR spectroscopy indicates the successful preparation of IP-GO.

TEM and SEM were utilized to observe the morphology of GO and P-GO.
The typical structures of GO after chemical exfoliation are seen in Figures S1 and S2, showing that the surface of
GO was relatively smooth with characteristic crumples. The covalent
graft modification of GO by IPDI and DMEA did not destroy the structure
of GO nanosheets, and the surface still showed a slightly folded structure.
The GO nanosheet structure was not destroyed in high-power SEM images,
and the observed results were consistent with TEM images.

XRD
spectra are often used to characterize the interlayer distance
of GO and graphene oxide derivatives, as shown in Figure 2c. It is found that the strong
(0 0 2) diffraction peaks of graphite and GO are at 2θ = 26.4°
and 2θ = 10.6°, suggesting an interlay distance of 0.34
and 0.84 nm, respectively. However, the diffraction peak of IP-GO
was replaced by a low-angle peak (2θ = 6.4°) with decreased
intensity, in which the interlayer distance was about 1.40 nm. These
results show that the short chain grafted to the surface of the GO
prevented the polymerization of graphene lamellae and increased the
interlayer distance. Further, a broad peak appears at about 2θ
= 17°, meaning that the modified graphene sheets show a slight
re-growth after drying. The typical Raman spectra of GO and IP-GO
are compared in Figure S3.

The modification
and reduction of GO nanosheets were characterized
by XPS. The chemical element and bond of the modification and reduction
of GO nanosheets were assessed by XPS characterization. Figure 3a exhibits the C 1s, O 1s,
and N 1s binding energies at about 286.0, 532.4, and 398.0 eV, respectively.
Compared to GO, it can be clearly seen from Figure 3a that an obvious peak of N at 398.0 eV is
displayed on the image of IP-GO. Figure 3b,c shows that C 1s spectra of GO and RGO
exhibit the binding energies at 284.6, 285.7, 286.4, and 288.3 eV
assigned to C–C, C–OH, −C–O–C–,
and COOH, respectively. In virtue of the loss of the oxygen-containing
functional groups, compared with GO, the atomic ratio of O/C of RGO
decreases significantly. Compared to GO, the XPS survey of IP-GO in Figure 3d shows two peaks
detected in the C 1s at 285.7 and 287.8 eV associated with C–N
and HN—C=O, respectively. There are two peaks in the
N 1s of IP-GO: C–N (399.4 eV) and HN—C=O (400.6
eV) (as shown in Figure 3e). These above information can testify that IPDI has grafted onto
the surface of GO by forming an amide bond group.

3.2 Characterization of WPU, GO/WPU, RGO/WPU,
and IP-GO/WPU Composite Coatings
Digital photos of water
(upper part) and waterborne polyurethane (lower part) dispersion of
GO and IP-GO after 15 days are exhibited in Figure S4. The dispersibility of the graphene derivative in the WPU
coating and the compatibility with the polymer matrix affect the morphology
of the composite coatings. This was investigated by studying the fracture
morphology of these samples by SEM analysis. SEM images of the composite
coatings are exhibited in Figure 4a–d at low magnification and Figure 4a′–d′
at high magnification. The thickness of these coatings is about 35
± 5 μm. The neat WPU coating shows a relatively smooth
surface, while the GO, RGO, and IP-GO strengthened WPU coatings show
a coarser surface due to the distribution of the graphene derivatives
and are easily seen at low magnification. The fractured surfaces of
GO/WPU and RGO/WPU coatings show the high roughness and some component
pull-out has been observed, which indicates a weak interaction between
GO and RGO with the polymer interface and weak compatibility. The
IP-GO/WPU presents a smoother surface than GO/WPU and RGO/WPU coatings,
suggesting no agglomerates of IP-GO in the polymer matrix and the
strong interface force of IP-GO nanosheets with the matrix. The molecular
chain grafted on the GO surface interacting with the WPU matrix increased
the dispersibility and compatibility of IP-GO in the polymer. IP-GO
shows a more regular arrangement in the polymer, while RGO show aggregation
and a random arrangement, which can be seen in high-power images.

of fractured surfaces of the coatings: (a, a′)
WPU, (b, b′) GO, (c, c′) RGO, and (d, d′) IP-GO
coatings (top panel, low magnification; bottom panel, high magnification).

Optical images can also be used to derive the dispersion
of graphene
and its derivatives in the WPU matrix, as shown in Figure 5. Optical microscopes have
different colors in their images due to their different substrates. Figure 5a is an optical picture
of pure WPU with a uniform color distribution. The dark color in Figure 5b–d was caused
by the presence of graphene. Figure 5b,c shows the phenomenon of agglomeration of graphene
in the WPU matrix. In Figure 5d, the IP-GO was particularly well dispersed in the WPU matrix.
The test results are consistent with the SEM results.

Figure 5 Optical microscope images
of (a) pure WPU, (b) GO, (c) RGO, and
(d) IP-GO reinforced WPU composite coatings.

Figure 6a presents
the tensile strength for neat WPU and graphene derivative reinforced
WPU composite coatings. The tensile strength of WPU has been significantly
improved after the enhancement of GO and IP-GO incorporation. Compared
to the IP-GO/WPU coating, the RGO/WPU composite coating has a low
tensile strength due to the weak dispersion and compatibility of RGO
in WPU. Figure 6b shows
the water absorption rate of neat WPU and graphene derivative reinforced
WPU composite coatings. Pure waterborne polyurethanes have a high
water absorption rate because they contain a large amount of hydrophilic
functional groups. Due to the impermeability of the graphene derivative
to water molecules, the water absorption of the composite coating
is significantly reduced after the addition of the graphene derivative.
The water absorption of the composite coatings is directly related
to the dispersion of the graphene derivative in the coatings. Because
the IP-GO/WPU composite has the best combination and compatibility
with the matrix, it has the lowest water absorption and the highest
efficiency for blocking the diffusion of water molecules in the coating.
Therefore, we have obtained that IP-GO has better dispersibility in
the coating and has the best barrier effect on corrosive media, which
is also consistent with the SEM observations.

and (b) water absorption rate test of pure
WPU, GO, RGO, and IP-GO reinforced WPU composite coatings.

EIS is one of the techniques to effectively evaluate the
corrosion
process of coatings and to gain insight into the corrosion performance
of coating on metals. The higher impedance at lower frequencies (e.g.,
|Z|0.1Hz) in the Bode modulus plot is associated with increased
corrosion resistance, and the slight decrease in value over time generally
indicates that the coating degrades as the environment changes. For
a complete coating without defects, the phase angle in the Bode plot
should be nearly 90° due to the higher electrical resistance
of the coating. The EIS spectra of the Bode modulus plot (left) and
Bode phase plot (right) of the WPU, GO/WPU, and RGO/WPU coatings and
IP-GO/WPU composite coatings with different exposure durations are
shown in Figure 7.
Due to the purely resistive nature of the coating, the coating had
a high impedance modulus in the low-frequency region and a phase angle
of approximately 90° in the high-frequency region at the beginning.
As the electrolyte solution gradually penetrated into the coating,
the impedance modulus of the low-frequency region continued to decrease
due to the parallel capacitance of the coating (as shown in Figure 8b). The addition
of 0.3 wt % GO obviously improved the corrosion resistance of the
composites. Compared with the pure WPU coating (Figure 7a,a′), the GO/WPU coating (Figure 7b,b′) had
higher impedance after 50 days of immersion in 3.5 wt % salt water
and the phase angle in the high-frequency region was close to 90°.
However, due to the poor dispersion of RGO in the polymer, the integrity
of the coating was lowered and the efficiency of the coating decreased.
The impedance of RGO/WPU coating decreased below 107 Ω
after 50 days of immersion, and two time constants appeared in the
Bode phase plot, indicating that the corrosion medium had invaded
the metal/coating interface (Figure 7c,c′). Quite differently, after 50 days of immersion
in 3.5 wt % salt water, the impedance modulus of the IP-GO/WPU coating
(Figure 7d,d′)
remained above 108 Ω, and the phase angle in the
high-frequency region was near 90°, showing the highest efficiency
for anticorrosion.

durations:

(a, a′) the pure WPU coating, (b, b′) the GO coating,
(c, c′) the RGO coating, and (d, d′) the IP-GO coating,
respectively.

Figure 8 Variations of impedance data including (a) log(fb) and (b) log|Z| at 0.1 Hz of WPU, GO/WPU,
RGO/WPU, and
IP-GO/PU coatings as a function of immersion time in a 3.5 wt % NaCl
solution at pH = 7.

The breakpoint frequency
(fb) corresponds
to the frequency of the 45° phase angle that was obtained from
the Bode phase plot, which is often used to analyze information about
coating delamination.43 It has been reported
that the reaction at the metal/coating interface of coatings could
be analyzed by the variation of fb with
immersion durations.44 As the corrosive
medium passes through the composite coating to the metal/coating interface,
the chemical corrosion reaction begins in the reactive site of the
metal surface. The values of fb for the
four paint coatings increased to higher values with the immersion
duration, as can be found in Figure 8a. The fb shifted to higher
values, suggesting the increase in the delaminated area. The fb of the coating after the addition of the RGO
nanosheets moved toward the high-frequency region compared to that
of the pure aqueous polyurethane coating. The GO addition delayed
the increase in fb. However, the fb of the coating decreased the most after the
addition of IP-GO, and the value remained at a lower position after
50 days of soaking. The diffusion of the corrosive medium to the surface
of the metal/substrate is the main cause of corrosion of the metal.
After electrochemical corrosion of the interface between the metal
and the coating, the hydroxyl anion will accumulate at the cathode
sites. This can accelerate the delamination and shedding of the coating.

The anticorrosive performance of the composite coatings was certificated
by the salt spray test. The images of the coatings after the salt
spray test for 25 days are exhibited in Figure 9. The large area of the brown corrosion product
was accumulated on the surface of the pure WPU, GO/WPU, and RGO/WPU
coatings after the 25 days salt spray test. The surface of the IP-GO/WPU
coating only showed slight corrosion after the same conditions of
the salt spray test. Both of the consequences from the salt spray
test and EIS test have shown that the IP-GO composite coatings have
the best anticorrosion performance, although the two techniques have
different accuracies and different ways of characterizing corrosion.

images of Q235 samples coated with WPU, GO/WPU, RGO/WPU,
and IP-GO/PU composite coatings before (top panel) and after (bottom
panel) subjected to the salt spray test for 480 h.

Based on the above analysis, the excellent corrosion resistance
of the graphene derivative anticorrosive coating is due to three factors:
(i) maintenance of a high specific surface area of graphene, (ii)
excellent dispersion of the graphene derivative in the composite material
matrix, and (iii) compatibility of the polymer with graphene derivative
sexuality and excellent interface combination. Graphene derivative
can be inhibited by forming an electrolyte outside the barrier network
in the polymer as schematically illustrated in Figure 10, and the functionalized graphene derivative
forms a protective network in the WPU matrix, delaying the time that
the corrosive medium enters the interface of the coating matrix. The
functionalized graphene derivative is capable of achieving a greater
degree of dispersion in the WPU matrix, giving full play to the action
of each piece of graphene derivative. Large-scale agglomeration of
the graphene derivative fails to provide a protective network and
sometimes destroys the continuity of the coating to accelerate corrosion.
Therefore, the corrosion resistance of the coating is directly related
to the good dispersion of the graphene derivative in the polymer matrix.

4 Conclusions
The amphiphilic graphene derivative
was prepared by covalent grafting
of GO with IPDI and DMEA and then noncovalent grafting of GO with
SDBS. Characterization results indicate that IPDI and DMEA were grafted
on the surface of GO by forming carbamate ester bonds. Compared to
other graphene derivatives, the IP-GO enhanced its dispersion and
compatibility in WPU. The
composite materials of 0.3 wt % GO, RGO, and IP-GO nanosheets combination
with the WPU, of which the IP-GO polyurethane composite had the highest
mechanical properties and the lowest water absorption. The anticorrosion
efficiency of the coating was significantly improved after the addition
of GO and IP-GO, but the increase in IP-GO was more pronounced. The
results show that IP-GO can form a perfect network structure in the
polymer to block the intrusion of corrosive media.
