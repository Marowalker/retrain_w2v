Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), which
are directly isolated as a native
form, have drawn considerable attention as eco-friendly and distinctive
material to be partly substituted for fossil products. In addition
to the increasing attention to the native CNFs, conventional regenerated
cellulose having cellulose II crystals also attracts more attention
because of its cost-effective method of production in a moderately
easy and repeatable fashion. Inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds
are, in particular, thought to contribute greatly to the physical
properties of cellulosic commercial products. More than half century
ago, Marchessault et al. attempted to directly assign the hydroxyl
(OH) group vibrations related to hydrogen bonding in infrared (IR)
spectra. The assignment, however, has not been significantly updated.
One reason for the delayed assignments is the difficulty in preparing
pure cellulose II. Here, we show successful IR assignments of the
interacted OH groups in cellulose II by using the nematic ordered
cellulose to prepare a highly oriented regenerated film. The film
had anisotropic crystalline domains, which provided a clearly resolved
component in the IR spectra. The OH bands were well assigned, and
this IR assignment becomes an effective tool to understand the structure–property
relationship for engineering advanced regenerated cellulose materials.

Introduction
In the past decade, cellulose nanofibers
(CNFs), which are less
than 50 nm wide and over 100 in the aspect ratio, have drawn considerable
attention as eco-friendly, novel, and distinctive material to be partly
substituted for a variety of fossil products. CNFs are directly isolated
as a native form from various widely available sustainable biomass
resources, such as wood fibers and bacterial cellulose, without dissolving
after chemical treatments. The character of CNFs leads to their use
as reinforcement in composites, components for electronic displays,
and CNF–polymer hybrid materials.6,7 In addition
to the increasing attention to the native CNFs, regenerated cellulose,
which has another crystalline phase and is prepared from the solution,
has also a long history as commonly available film and fiber materials.8 Electrospun CNFs as one of the regenerated celluloses
has recently attracted more attention, as well as native CNFs, because
of their cost-effective method of production in a moderately easy,
repeatable, and simple fashion.9−11 Thus, it becomes further important
to understand more detailed basic information on the structure–property
relationship for engineering advanced regenerated cellulose materials.12,13

Inter- and intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions are,
in
particular, thought to contribute greatly to the physical properties
of cellulosic commercial products. Many researchers have investigated
the formation of hydrogen bonds in the crystalline phases of regenerated
cellulose, termed cellulose II, using analytical methods, such as
X-ray diffraction (XRD),14−22 neutron diffraction,23 and infrared (IR)
spectroscopy.24−27

More than half century ago, Marchessault et al. attempted
to directly
assign hydroxyl (OH) group vibrations related to hydrogen bonding
in IR spectra using polarized IR spectroscopy, mercerized ramie, and
Fortisan 36. They interpreted OH bands at 3175, 3305, and 3350 cm–1 as intermolecular hydrogen bonds and OH bands at
3447 and 3488 cm–1 as intramolecular hydrogen bonds.25 The assignment established by Marchessault et
al. has not been significantly changed since then. That is, the OH
group vibrations have not been sufficiently elucidated, particularly
when compared with IR vibrations of native cellulose crystals (cellulose
I).28 One reason for the delayed assignments
is the difficulty in preparing highly ordered cellulose II.

Our recent research proposed a new supramolecular structure of
cellulose, which is noncrystalline but contains highly ordered β-glucan
cellulose chains.1−4 We termed this structure nematic ordered cellulose (NOC). An NOC
film could be transformed into uniaxially ordered cellulose II while
maintaining the initial molecular orientation of NOC, when the film
was mercerized in 17.5% aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).5

In the current study, we assign hydrogen-bonding
vibrations in
cellulose II crystalline phases from resolved polarized Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of the mercerized NOC film. The main difficulty
in analyzing OH bands arises from the overlapping crystalline and
noncrystalline spectral regions of cellulose samples. The use of vapor-phase
deuteration and FTIR measurements enables the separation of molecular
packing domains depending on the engaged states of OH groups to be
investigated.29−31 We propose another method using vapor-phase deuteration
and polarized FTIR to examine OH group orientation in the NOC film.32 These two vapor-phase deuteration methods allow
the separation of OH group absorptions of crystalline regions from
those of noncrystalline regions, in the IR spectra of cellulose samples.
The IR spectrum reveals the OH band of cellulose II crystalline phases
of the mercerized NOC film. The deconvolution of OH bands upon deuteration
yields resolved OH bands of individual hydrogen bonds. Nondestructive
IR spectroscopy is commonly used because of its easy handling of sampling
and easy measurements. IR spectroscopy, moreover, has potential to
become a powerful tool to provide specific information about the assignment
of hydrogen-bond vibrations of crystalline cellulose II when it combines
with a polarizer, mercerized NOC films, vapor-phase deuteration, and
deconvolution of OH bands after vapor-phase deuteration.

Results
Wide-angle XRD (WAXD) patterns (Figure 1) of the mercerized film in the equatorial
and meridional directions show that the ordered supramolecular NOC
structure was converted to the oriented cellulose II allomorph upon
alkaline treatment. The equatorial and meridional profiles of the
NOC film are typical of those expected for a cellulose II crystalline
structure.5,33 The degree of crystallinity of the treated
NOC film was 44.3%, which indicated that the film contained more than
50% noncrystalline regions. The film had been deuterated for 10 days,
and the exchange reaction did not almost proceed in the last 72 h.
Then, the hydrogen bonds were assigned using the remained OH band
due to OH groups in cellulose II in IR spectra. Therefore, the interpretation
of the hydrogen bonds in cellulose II was not probably affected by
the noncrystalline regions. The crystalline orientation factor was
estimated at 92% from the azimuthal WAXD pattern at the (004) plane.

of the mercerized NOC film. Upper left: WAXD image; upper
right: crystallinity and crystalline orientation factors; lower left:
equatorial WAXD profiles before and after mercerization; lower right:

Figure 2 shows that
the intensity of the OH absorption band in the nonpolarized IR spectrum
decreased and became less saturated, following vapor-phase deuteration
(cf. Figure 2a,b).
This suggests that the available OH groups in the noncrystalline regions
of the mercerized NOC were converted to OD groups using vapor-phase
deuteration,29,32 as stated in the Experimental Section, accounting for the decreased absorption
of OH band (Figure 2b). Figure 2b shows
the OH band obtained after deuteration and derived from the OH groups
in the crystalline regions of the mercerized NOC. The polarized IR
spectrum after deuteration indicates that the β-1,4-glucan chains
of cellulose were highly oriented because of the profound difference
between the parallel (//) and perpendicular (⊥) spectra in Figure 2c. Moreover, the
dichroic ratio, which indicates the orientation of the β-1,4-glucan
chains, was calculated in the same manner as our previous report.32 The dichroic ratio (R) is a
relative value of the absorbance of the perpendicular spectra to the
absorbance of the parallel spectra.32 A
value giving R < 1.0 represents a preferentially
parallel orientation, whereas a value showing R >
1.0 indicates a favorable perpendicular orientation.32 The calculated R was 0.17, indicating
that β-1,4-glucan chains contained in the mercerized NOC film
were highly oriented to the stretching direction.

direction; gray (⊥): electric vector perpendicular to the stretching
direction.

Parallel and perpendicular OH
bands obtained after vapor-phase
deuteration were deconvoluted into nine individual OH bands in total
(Figures 3 and 4) using GRAMS 386 “CurveFit” analysis,
as described in the Experimental Section and
the same manner of our previous report.34

bands.

The OH band parallel to the stretching
direction was deconvoluted
into four OH bands (Figure 3). The two OH stretching vibrations at 3491 and 3447 cm–1 were likely due to intramolecular hydrogen bonds,
preferentially orientated along the long axis of the β-1,4-glucan
chains.25 The small band at 3329 cm–1 in Figure 3 is possibly attributed to an intermolecular hydrogen bond
slightly parallel to the β-1,4-glucan chains. Details of small
bands are described later.

The OH band perpendicular to the
stretching direction was deconvoluted
into five OH bands (Figure 4). Stretching vibrations at 3353, 3276, and 3162 cm–1 are supposed to correspond to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds
engaged in β-1,4-glucan chains.25 The small perpendicular bands centered at 3496 and 3448 cm–1 may be due to the perpendicular components of the transition moments
of the two intramolecular hydrogen bonds at 3491 and 3447 cm–1 in the parallel spectrum of Figure 3. These two hydrogen bonds were largely (but not exactly)
aligned along the long axis of the β-1,4-glucan chains. A more
detailed study is necessary to further investigate these two small
bands.

Force constants of OH groups related to the magnitude
of intra-
and intermolecular hydrogen bonds were calculated from the obtained
wavenumbers, assuming the OH group to be a diatomic molecule. Details
are available in our previous report.30 Force constants of OH groups engaged in intramolecular hydrogen
bonds were calculated to be 680 and 663 N/m for the 3491 and 3447
cm–1 bands, respectively. OH force constants for
intermolecular hydrogen bonds were 627, 599, and 558 N/m for bands
at 3353, 3276, and 3162 cm–1, respectively. The
magnitude of force constants represents the strength of bonding between
the hydroxyl O and H atoms. A stronger O—H covalent bond corresponds
to a weaker hydrogen bonding due to the longer distance between O
and H atoms in the engagement. Thus, a larger force constant indicates
a longer hydrogen bond. The calculated force constants suggest that
the length of the above two intramolecular hydrogen bonds was higher
than that of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

Discussion
The
assignment of the five predominant OH absorption bands in the
resolved parallel and perpendicular spectra is similar to recent analyses
of the regenerated cellulose II crystalline allomorph using X-ray
and neutron diffraction.23 The proposed
hydrogen-bonding scheme23 differs from
that of earlier studies based on XRD.14−19 The scheme does not contain intramolecular hydrogen bonds between
the C-2 OH group (OH group at the C-2 position) and the C-6 OH group
of the adjacent glucose ring, as is typical for cellulose I. The C-3
OH group is involved in a three-centered intramolecular hydrogen bond.
Predominant bonding occurs between the C-3o,c OH group
and the C-5o,c O atom of the adjacent glucose ring. Here,
“origin” and “center” chains are denoted
as “o” and “c”, respectively. Conventional
“up” and “down” chains are referred to
as origin and center chains, respectively.23 Minor bonding arises between the C-3o,c OH group and
the C-6o,c OH group of the adjacent glucose ring. The O···H
distance of the latter is longer than that of the former. Four major
intermolecular bonds are formed: (1) between the C-2c OH
group and the neighboring C-2o O atom; (2) between the
C-6o OH group and the C-6c O atom of the glucose
ring of the adjacent β-1,4-glucan chain; (3) between the C-2o OH group and the neighboring C-6o O atom; and
(4) between the C-6c OH group and the neighboring C-2c O atom.23 The lengths of these
four bonds are in the range expected for intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
Specifically, the distances between donor and acceptor atoms for each
of the above intermolecular bonds (from Langan et al.23) are 2.783, 2.643, 2.713, and 2.682 Å, respectively,
and the distances between the hydrogen and the acceptor atom are 2.212,
2.015, 1.817, and 1.784 Å, respectively.

Deconvoluted bands
were assigned on the basis of three factors:
OH group force constant, cellulose II hydrogen-bonding scheme, and
O···H distance of the above-mentioned intra- and intermolecular
hydrogen bonds. Of the two bands in the spectrum recorded parallel
to the stretching direction (Figure 3), the band at 3491 cm–1 is probably
assigned to the intramolecular bonding between the C-3o,c OH group and the C-6o,c OH group of the adjacent glucose
ring (between D3 and O6 in Figures 5–7). The larger force constant indicates a longer bond length. The
band at 3447 cm–1 is likely attributed to the intramolecular
bonding between the C-3o,c OH group and the C-5o,c O atom of the adjacent glucose ring (between D3 and O5 in Figures 5–7). A further investigation, however, is necessary
to assign appropriately one of the two bands to one of the two types
of intramolecular bonding because the C-3 OH group is involved in
a three-centered intramolecular hydrogen bond and one cannot separate
definitely in IR spectra the bond between the C-3o,c OH
group and the C-5o,c O atom and the bond between the C-3o, c OH group and the C-6o,c OH group.

Figure 7 Hydrogen bonding between origin chains in regenerated cellulose
II crystalline phases based on Langan et al.23 The labeling system is that used in Figure 5.

The three predominant OH bands in the spectrum recorded perpendicular
to the stretching direction (Figure 4) at (1) 3353, (2) 3276, and (3) 3162 cm–1 are attributed to the intermolecular bonding (1) between the C-2c OH group and the C-2o O atom (between D2 and O2
in Figure 5) and/or
between the C-6o OH group and the C-6c O atom
(between D6 and O6 in Figure 5), (2) between the C-2o OH group and the C-6o O atom (between D2 and O6 in Figure 7), and (3) between the C-6c OH
group and the C-2c O atom (between D6 and O2 in Figure 6), respectively.
Intermolecular hydrogen bonds were assigned on the basis of larger
force constants indicating a longer hydrogen bond. Of these three
bands, those at 3353 and 3162 cm–1 were calculated
to have the largest and smallest force constants, respectively, and
thus were attributed to the longest and shortest bonds, respectively.
Accurate hydrogen bond lengths were obtained from Langan et al., as
already described.23

Concerning the
OH band at 3353 cm–1 in the perpendicular
spectrum, it is hard to assign it appropriately because the formation
of hydrogen bonds is intricate in the sheet containing both origin
and center chains. In the sheet, there are two major types of intermolecular
hydrogen bonding between the C-2c OH group and the C-2o O atom and between the C-6o OH group and the C-6c O atom,23 as mentioned above.
The C-6o OH groups are engaged in four-centered intermolecular
hydrogen bonding,23 which produces possibly,
except for the major bonding, two minor bonding between the C-6o OH group and the C-5c O atom and between the C-6o OH group and the C-3c O atom.23,35 An explanation for this arrangement is that bonding between the
C-6o OH group of origin chains and the neighboring C-6c O atom of center chains forms when the latter O atom is in
a gauche–trans (gt) conformation.35 Hydrogen bonding between the C-6o OH group and the C-3c O atom forms when the neighboring C-6c O atom
is in a trans–gauche (tg) conformation.35 The C-6c O atom of center chains in regenerated
cellulose was reported to be up to 30% in a tg conformation and 70%
in a gt conformation.35 On the other hand,
neither the C-2c OH group nor the C-2o OH group
is involved in the four-centered intermolecular hydrogen bonding,
which possibly indicates that more numbers of hydrogen bonds between
the C-2c OH group and C-2o O atom are involved
in our samples. Therefore, the OH band at 3353 cm–1 could be due to the bonding between the C-2c OH group
and the C-2o O atom. As to the parallel bands at 3450 and
3329 cm–1 (Figure 3), it might be attributed to the complicated formation
of the hydrogen bonding between center and origin chains. A more detailed
study is needed to obtain further information on the hydrogen bonding
in the center–origin sheet and the corresponding IR bands.

Table 1 shows the
five major OH absorption bands obtained by deconvolution, assigned
to specific hydrogen-bonding engagements. Assignments are made according
to the band type (parallel or perpendicular) and ordered by bond length
evaluated from the magnitude of the OH force constant. For example,
the OH band at 3491 cm–1, which was assigned to
the intramolecular hydrogen bond, is listed on the top of the table
because the hydrogen bond is the longest23 and its force constant has to be the largest of the five predominant
OH bands.

c A
further investigation is necessary
to assign each intramolecular hydrogen bond accurately.

d Origin and center chains are denoted
as o and c, respectively. Conventional up and down chains are referred
to as origin and center chains, respectively.23

The length of the hydrogen
bond of the 3447 cm–1 band is shorter than that
of the 3353 cm–1 band,
although the force constant of the former is larger than that of the
latter. The OH band at 3353 cm–1 corresponds to
the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between origin chains and center
chains in this study. Therefore, this phenomenon occurs specifically
in the sheet containing both origin and center chains. In the sheet,
there are two three-centered (bifurcated)-type intramolecular hydrogen
bonds and three four-centered-type and one two-centered (normal)-type
intermolecular hydrogen bonds, as illustrated in Figure 5. The C-6 OH group of the origin
chain is especially related to the intramolecular hydrogen bonds as
well as the intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The O atom is involved
in one of the two intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and the H atom is
involved in three intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The complicated hydrogen
bonding, including one two-centered (normal)-type intermolecular hydrogen
bond, could affect the value of the force constant of the 3353 cm–1 band, which caused the phenomenon that a smaller
value of the force constant corresponds to longer hydrogen bonds.

Conclusions
A pure cellulose molecule consists of only three kinds of atoms,
carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, which form a straight-chain composed
of six-membered glucose rings having OH groups. The structure of the
molecule is simple enough because the molecule is not associated with
long branched chains or bulky functional groups. IR bands of most
OH groups in cellulose I crystals have been assigned by Maréchal
and Chanzy.28 Such assignments are of interest,
as these bonds are thought to control the physical properties of native
cellulosic materials. An entire assignment of IR bands of the cellulosic
polymorph has not been reported although the molecular structure of
cellulose is simple. More information is required especially on OH
absorption bands and hydrogen bonding in cellulose II because of its
widespread use in eco-friendly regenerated cellulose films and fibers.
A regenerated cellulose allomorph, cellulose II, has been recently
classified in terms of three-dimensional coordinates, including those
of hydrogen-bond patterns. The current study characterizes the hydrogen
bonding of an oriented cellulose II film, prepared by facile mercerization
of NOC1−5 that is highly noncrystalline but has highly ordered β-glucan
chains. Vapor-phase deuteration of the available hydroxyl groups of
cellulose II allowed the corresponding functional groups of crystalline
domains to be investigated by polarized FTIR measurements. IR absorption
bands due to stretching vibrations were deconvoluted and clearly resolved
into individual component vibrations. Accordingly, absorption bands
of OH groups in cellulose II were capable of being assigned, and this
technique is an effective tool for characterizing hydrogen bonding
in regenerated cellulosic materials that are widely used as commodity
chemicals as well as novel cellulosic products.

Our study assigns
hydrogen bonds of ordered cellulose II with highly
ordered β-glucan chains across the entire film, using vapor-phase
deuteration and polarized FTIR as follows: Polarized infrared OH absorption
bands of crystalline phases after the vapor-phase deuteration were
deconvoluted into five predominant bands. The bands at 3491 and 3447
cm–1 in the spectrum recorded parallel to stretching
were assigned to intramolecular hydrogen bonds because these bonds
preferentially form along the direction of the long axis of β-1,4-glucan
chains. The remaining bands at 3353, 3276, and 3162 cm–1 in the spectrum recorded perpendicular to stretching were assigned
to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between β-1,4-glucan chains.
The interpretation of the OH absorption bands was almost similar to
that reported by Marchessault et al.25 They
demonstrated that there were two types of OH bands related to intramolecular
hydrogen bonds and three types of OH bands related to intermolecular
hydrogen bonds25 in cellulose II, as stated
above. The distinguished point from our present claim is that they
assigned the two OH bands in parallel spectra to the intramolecular
hydrogen bonds formed only between the C-3 OH group and the C-5 O
atom of the adjacent glucose ring because they predicted two different
parallel bands derived from two types of the C-3 O atom: (1) the C-3
O atom involved in both intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds and
(2) the C-3 O atom of the adjacent glucose ring not involved in the
intermolecular hydrogen bond.25 The obtained
bands were, moreover, assigned by considering the force constants
of OH groups forming intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds and
the hydrogen bond lengths from a reported proposed scheme for cellulose
II.23 Combining vapor-phase deuteration
and polarized FTIR spectroscopy allows the characterization of hydrogen
bonds in regenerated cellulose II or crystalline phases in regenerated
cellulose. Thus, our IR data in this study compensate for the assignment
to cellulose II, which contributes with the published cellulose I
and II IR data24−28 to analyze cellulosic products that are widely used as commodity
materials or produce novel cellulosic materials such as derivatives
for medical use and nanofibers for additive substances from biomass.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The starting material was bleached cotton
linters with a degree of polymerization of 1300, which was dried under
vacuum at 40 °C before use. N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAc) of >99% purity (Katayama Chemicals Co.
Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was dehydrated with 3 Å molecular sieves
and used without further purification. Lithium chloride (LiCl) powder
(Katayama Chemicals Co. Ltd.) was oven-dried for 3 days at 105 °C.
NaOH and deuterium oxide of purity >99.75% were purchased from
Wako
Pure Chemical Industries Ltd (Tokyo, Japan).

Mercerization of the NOC
Film
The NOC film was prepared
as previously described.1,2,5,32 The crystallinity index of this
film was estimated to be 16.3% from density measurements. The NOC
film was mercerized as described previously.5 In brief, the fixed-state NOC film mounted on a stretching device
was soaked in 17.5% aqueous NaOH at room temperature for several hours,
followed by washing with water. The sample was air-dried while retaining
sample tension and then dried under vacuum at 40 °C.

Measurements
The mercerized NOC film was mounted in
a purpose-made IR-measurement cell suitable for vapor-phase deuteration.29−32 Polarized FTIR spectra after deuteration were collected using a
PerkinElmer Spectrum 2000 FTIR spectrometer, with the light electric
vector parallel and perpendicular to the stretching direction. These
spectra were obtained over the 4000–850 cm–1 spectral region from 32 scans at 2 cm–1 resolution
using a DTGS detector. The film sample was thoroughly dried under
vacuum at 50 °C before vapor-phase deuteration to remove residual
water.

Spectra were recorded before and after the vapor-phase
deuteration process, that is, when the OH–OD exchange reaction
with D2O molecules reached an equilibrium state. As the
exchange reaction proceeded, OH groups contained in the noncrystalline
regions of the film were gradually exchanged to OD groups. Accordingly,
the intensity of the OH absorption band was decreased, and instead
the OD band in spectra appeared and increased, similar to the phenomenon
we reported previously.29−32 The IR spectra following the vapor-phase deuteration
were then capable of providing the OH band remained in the crystalline
regions of the mercerized NOC film, which allowed to analyze the hydrogen
bonding in cellulose II crystalline phases.

Deconvolution of OH Bands
Parallel and Perpendicular to the
Stretching Direction Obtained after Vapor-Phase Deuteration
Curve fitting for the peak deconvolution was performed by GRAMS 386
CurveFit analysis (Galactic Industries Corp., Salem, NH). The true
shape of the peak obtained from the hydroxyl absorption bands for
samples was assumed to be Lorentzian. The number of peaks involved
was determined on the basis of the second-derivative FTIR spectra
for the samples, in the range of 3300–3650 cm–1. Calculations were repeated until a best fit was obtained with R2 = 0.999.

Schematic Representation
of the Hydrogen Bonding of β-1,4-Glucan
Chains in Cellulose II
We used data on the hydrogen bonding
of β-1,4-glucan chains in cellulose II reported by Langan et
al.23 They deuterated cellulose II crystalline
samples to “replace the six independent H atoms involved in
hydrogen bonding to six deuterium atoms, without any loss of crystalline
perfection” for high-resolution neutron fiber diffraction patterns.23 It should be noted that our aim, by using vapor-phase
deuteration, focusing on the removal of OH band contained in noncrystalline
regions is totally different from that of Langan et al.

Schematic
representation of the hydrogen bonding in cellulose II based on the
data by Langan et al.23 was made using
VESTA: a three-dimensional visualization program for electronic and
structural analysis.36 To interpret hydrogen
bonding in cellulose II, we consulted the report by Langan et al.,23 which discussed hydrogen bonding in regenerated
cellulose II crystalline structures. There are two distinct processes
(regeneration and mercerization) for converting crystalline cellulose
I to cellulose II.35 The molecular assembly
states in regenerated cellulose are similar to those in mercerized
cellulose; however, Langan et al.35 suggested
the conformation of center-chain hydroxymethyl groups (defined as
down chains) in regenerated cellulose differs from that in mercerized
cellulose. Mercerization involves swelling cellulose I crystals, whereas
regenerated cellulose II is prepared from either cellulose solution
or its derivatives.35 Our cellulose film
basically obtained from a DMAc/LiCl cellulose solution1,2,5,32 is
considered to be a regenerated cellulose. Therefore, the conformation
of hydroxymethyl groups in regenerated cellulose II23 is adopted in the current study to assign hydrogen bonds,
referring to the distance between oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) atoms
in hydrogen-bonding interactions.
