The
all-thiophene-based double helix DH-1 was designed
and prepared originally from the selective deprotonation of cyclooctatetrathiophene
(tetra[3,4]thienylene, COTh) and following the Negishi
coupling reaction with 3,3′-bithiophene. The X-ray crystallographic
studies revealed that DH-1 has a double-helical scaffold.
The arylations including tetraphenylation and tetrathienylation were
efficiently employed to replace the four α-protons of the central COTh of DH-1 with phenyl and thiophenyl groups
via cross-coupling reactions. The chiral resolution of rac-DH-1 was fulfilled via chiral high-performance liquid
chromatography, and the chiroptical properties were characterized
by circular dichroism spectra and optical rotation. Ultraviolet–visible
absorption and fluorescence behaviors of DH-1 and its
arylation products were also characterized to describe the extended
conjugated scaffold.

Introduction
Organic double helices
are one of the significant species because
of their characteristic molecular configurations and extensive applications.
Structurally, double helices are constituted of two flexible helical
molecular chains which are linked by multiple modes, such as the van
der Waals forces,1 hydrogen bonds,2 π–π intermolecular interactions,3 coordinate bonds,4 and covalent bonds.5 Among these, covalent
bond-linked double helices could exhibit higher stability and could
be more practical for applications such as chiral materials and catalysis.
As their pioneering work, Rajca6 and Marsella7 reported covalent bond-linked double helices
on the basis of two tetraphenyl and tetrathienyl chains (Figure 1) in 1997 and 2000,
respectively. As the continuation of the work, Wong8 and Wang9 extended the helical
chains along with the horizontal (one-dimensional) trend recently
and obtained two longest double helices, which contain two hexaphenyl
and hexathienyl chains (Figure 1), respectively. However, the two-dimensional cross-derivatization
of the double helices have been rarely reported. One of the main reasons
is that the reported double helices including tetra- and hexa-aryl
double helices do not have applicable active Ar–H for further
vertical derivatization.

Figure 1 Molecular structures of covalent bond-linked
double helices based
on phenyl and thienyl chains.

In our previous work, the high selectivity for ipsilateral
deprotonation
of COTh was studied, and a stepwise lithiation procedure
was proved.9,10 For utilizing this selective
deprotonation, three one-dimensional double-helical shaped oligothiophenes
were synthesized (Figure 2).9 Meanwhile, a systematic synthetic
strategy of one-dimensional oligothiophenes based on the selective
deprotonation of COTh was empolyed. As the extension
to these amazing works, herein, we have designed and synthesized a
novel one-dimensional thiophene-based double helix (DH-1) by the Negishi coupling reaction between bithiophene and COTh. DH-1 has four active α-H on the central COTh unit for further two-dimensional derivatization. Besides
the efficient chiral resolution of DH-1, the tetrabromination
and tetra-arylation have effectively occurred at the central COTh unit of DH-1 (Figure 3). Furthermore, the crystal structure of DH-1 and the spectroscopic properties of DH-1 and its aryl derivatives are also described.

Results and Discussion
Syntheses of DH-1 and Its Arylation
There
are two synthetic routes to DH-1. According to the ipsilateral
selectivity of deprotonation of COTh in the presence
of n-BuLi in tetrahydrofuran (THF),9,10 the obtained tetralithiated intermediate was converted to an aryl
zinc intermediate in Route-A (Scheme 1) for a further Negishi reaction with 2,2′-dibromo-5,5′-bistrimethylsilanyl[3,3′]bithiophenyl
(BTBT) at 120 °C. Such a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling
generated DH-1 in a low yield of 10%. The low yield might
be from the steric hindrance of two ZnCl groups and the weak activity
of the C–Br bond of BTBT in the Negishi reaction.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Routes to DH-1 and Its Aryl Derivatives
To avoid the adverse factors
and increase the reaction yield, the
Negishi reagent was changed from the COTh zinc intermediate
to the BTBT zinc intermediate and then reacted with COTh–I(10) (Route-B, Scheme 1). Under the same
palladium-catalyzed reaction conditions as shown in Route-A, the yield
of DH-1 was enhanced from 10% to 35%. The improvement
of the synthetic yield may be attributed to the higher reactivity
of the C–I bond from the aryl iodide.

Arylation of DH-1 is very important to the double
helix, so that the functionalized derivatives may be employed in some
fields, such as opt-electric materials, supermolecular chemistry,
and so on. The big challenge is in the organic synthesis itself because
of the activity of the four α-H on the central COTh unit of DH-1 and the steric hindrance for bond formation.
In our case, DH-1 was first treated with n-BuLi in THF at −78 °C. After the deprotonation at 60
°C for 2 h and the following quenching with 1,2-dibromotetrachloroethane, DH-1–Br was obtained in 80% yield (Scheme 1). The respective results indicate
that α-H on the central COTh unit of DH-1 have enough activity for deprotonation, which is helpful for further
vertical derivatization.

The tetrathienylation of DH-1 took place between the
organozinc intermediate prepared from tetradeprotonated DH-1 and 3-bromothiophene in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4. Such a coupling reaction generated DH-1–Th in a yield of 26%. Besides the Negishi coupling, Suzuki reaction
was also employed for tetraphenylation. The reaction of DH-1–Br and phenylboronic acid in the presence of CsCO3 and Pd(PPh3)4 was performed, and the target product DH-1–Ph was yielded in 34% (Scheme 1).

With the good successes of bromination
and arylation of DH-1, a more synthetic challenging work
for making a cross-double helix, DH-5, is of high interest
to us because of its cross-dimensional
double-helical configuration. Referred to the reaction conditions
of thienylation and phenylation of DH-1, two approaches
(Route-A and Route-B, Scheme 2) from DH-1 and DH-1–Br under
the conditions of Negishi reaction were empolyed to synthesize DH-5. Unfortunately, DH-5 has not been produced
after many attempts by changing the reaction conditions. One of the
possible reasons is the torsional strain of the double-helical skeleton,
which may be too huge to lead the harsh building of the new vertical COThs.

Scheme 2 Unsuccessful Synthetic Routes to DH-5
X-ray Crystal Structure
Analyses of DH-1
The single crystal of DH-1 was obtained by slow evaporation
from the chloroform/methanol (1:3, v/v) solution. Its crystal belongs
to the triclinic space group P1̅. The crystal
structure of DH-1 is shown in Figure 4a, from which the double-helical molecular
configuration can be visualized. Similar to the reported DH-3,9DH-1 has three COTh moieties, which are sequentially annelated together in the molecule,
and the two quadruple thiophene chains are intertwined with each other
via the C–C single bonds. Different from the case of DH-3, which has one tetra[2,3]thienylene and two tetra[3,4]thienylene,9 however, DH-1 shows an alternation
of two tetra[2,3]thienylene and one tetra[3,4]thienylene. Additionally,
the molecular length of DH-1 is 12.325 Å (C5···C22),
which is longer than that of DH-3 (11.921 Å). Simultaneously,
the average value of the dihedral angles of the two terminal thiophene
rings of each strand in the double-helical oligomer is decreased from
196° of DH-3 to 168° of DH-1.
These correlative changes are due to the twist degree of the COTh core of each double helix, which is influenced by the
steric hindrance of the introduced TMS groups.

Figure 4 X-ray crystal structures
(a) and crystal packing (b) of DH-1. Carbon, silicon,
sulfur, and chlorine atoms are depicted with the
thermal ellipsoids set at the 30% probability level. All hydrogen
atoms are omitted for clarity.

Figure 4b
shows
the packing of DH-1. Two pairs of enantiomers are stacked
in a unit cell. Multiple interactions between the molecules of the
CHCl3 solvent and the molecules of DH-1 lend
the molecular arrangements, such as Cl3···C18 (3.421
Å), Cl4···H24C (2.848 Å), H46A···S1
(2.892 Å), and H46A···H2B (2.358 Å). It is
clear that the CHCl3 solvent shows an important factor
for the formation of the DH-1 crystal.

Resolution
of Double Helix rac-DH-1 and the Chiroptical
Properties
The resolution of rac-DH-1 was carried out by chiral high-performance
liquid chromatography, with n-hexane/isopropanol
(99.5:0.5, v/v) as the eluent. The two enantiomers were obtained on
a semipreparative-scale chiral column (Figure S17, Supporting Information). From the 5 mg scale of rac-DH-1, 2.1 mg (ee = 84%) of (+)-DH-1 and
1.2 mg (ee = 89%) of (−)-DH-1 were obtained. The
optical rotations of (+)-DH-1, [α]D23 = +200°
(c = 0.0013 g/mL in dichloromethane) and (−)-DH-1, [α]D23 = −210° (c = 0.0013 g/mL in
dichloromethane) were observed, respectively. The circular dichroism
(CD) spectra of (+)-DH-1 and (−)-DH-1 were taken in dichloromethane. Two enantiomers, (+)-DH-1 and (−)-DH-1, show nearly identical symmetric
image spectra (Figure 5).

Figure 5 CD spectra of (−)-DH-1 (black line, ee = 89%,
1.4 × 10–5 M in dichloromethane) and (+)-DH-1 (red line, ee = 84%, 1.4 × 10–5 M in dichloromethane) at room temperature.

Electronic Absorption Spectra of DH-1 and the Arylation
Products
The ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption
spectra of DH-1, DH-1–Th, and DH-1–Ph in dichloromethane are shown in Figure 6a. DH-1 has two
major absorption peaks at 231 and 282 nm and a weak absorption band
peaked at 344 nm. In the absorption spectra of DH-1–Th, the introduction of thienyl leads the major absorption peaks bathochromic-shifted
to 239 and 286 nm compared with the case of DH-1. In
the case of DH-1–Ph, its absorption behavior is
very similar to that of DH-1–Th. Compared with
the case of DH-1, DH-1–Ph and DH-1–Th show high intensity and broad absorption band
in the long-wavelength region. Such spectroscopic behaviors are attributed
to the extended conjugations of DH-1–Ph and DH-1–Th. Meanwhile, the phenyl groups and thiophenyl
groups show conjugation effects similar to that of DH-1 because of their twist configurations in the molecules of DH-1–Ph and DH-1–Th.

Figure 6 (a) UV–vis
spectra of DH-1, DH-1–Ph, and DH-1–Th in dichloromethane ([C] = 1 ×
10–5 M). (b) Fluorescence spectra of DH-1, DH-1–Ph, and DH-1–Th in
dichloromethane ([C] = 1 × 10–5 M), λex = 330 nm, slit: 5/5.

The fluorescence behaviors of DH-1, DH-1–Ph, and DH-1–Th in dichloromethane are also characterized.
As shown in Figure 6b, DH-1 shows a much strong emission peaked at 457 nm.
Compared with the case of DH-1, DH-1–Ph and DH-1–Th exhibit a much weak emission, and
their emission peaks are bathochromic-shifted to 525 and 516 nm, respectively.
The obvious bathochromic shifts of emission are attributed to the
increased conjugation extension of DH-1–Ph and DH-1–Th. The single bond rotation between the aryl
groups and the central COTh unit might be the main reason
for the increase in the nonradiative deactivation processes and decrease
in the intensity of emission.

Theoretical Calculations
for Electronic Absorption Spectra of DH-1 and the Arylation
Products
To obtain the effects
of molecular structure and electronic structure on the spectroscopic
properties of DH-1 and its derivatives, their electronic
structures and excited-state calculations were performed by density
functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations using
Gaussian 09 program package.11 The geometries
were fully optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.12 Subsequently, frequency analysis was also performed
at the same level of theory to ensure that the structures correspond
to a true minimum. On the basis of the optimized geometries, the excited-state
calculations were performed by using the MPW1B95 functional13 and the polarizable continuum model14 at the 6-31G* level. As depicted in Figure S18
(Supporting Information) and Figure 6a, the shapes and positions of absorption peaks (listed in
Table S2, Supporting Information) from
the predicted UV–vis spectra were consistent with the experimental
curves. The excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and transition
contributions of the most important states are listed in Table S2. In the predicted UV–vis spectrum
of DH-1, the two major absorption peaks located at 231
and 282 nm were in agreement with the experimental results. Further,
the largest contributions to the major absorption peaks were attributed
to S0 → S37 and S0 →
S7, respectively. The lowest energy absorption band of DH-1 was associated to the S0 → S2 transition, which was dominated by the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) – 1 → lowest occupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) + 1 and HOMO → LUMO transitions. Compared with DH-1, there were slight bathochromic shifts for the values
of the two major absorption peaks in the spectra of DH-1–Ph and DH-1–Th. Further, the high-intensity absorption
bands in the long-wavelength region in DH-1–Ph and DH-1–Th were attributed to the large transition
dipole moments between S0 and S2, as listed
in Table S2.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have explored the efficient synthesis of the all-thiophene-based
double helix, DH-1, and studied its crystal structure,
chiral resolution, and chiroptical property. Such covalent bond-linked
double helices could be more practical for applications such as chiral
materials and catalysis after functionalization. Furthermore, bromination
and arylation efficiently occur at the four active α-positions
on the central COTh unit of DH-1, which
means DH-1 is a potential candidate for making the amazing
two-dimensional cross-double helix, DH-5. It has been
proved in our current work that making DH-5 is a huge
challenge, but the attempts have not been given up in our lab.

Experimental
Section
General Procedures and Materials
THF was freshly distilled
from sodium/benzophenone prior to use. The compound BTBT was prepared according to our previous research work.15 The concentration of n-BuLi
(in hexane) was determined by titration with N-pivaloyl-o-toluidine.16 Silica gel (300–400
mesh) was employed for column chromatography. Analytical thin-layer
chromatography was performed on glass plates of silica gel GF-254
with UV detection. The standard techniques for synthesis under an
inert atmosphere, using gasbag and Schlenk glassware equipped with
an 8 mm polytetrafluoroethylene vacuum stopcock, were employed. All
starting materials and reagents were commercially available. The two
enantiomers (+)-DH-1 and (−)-DH-1 were obtained on a semipreparative-scale chiral column (RC-SCDP5).

The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and carbon
(13C) NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz NMR instrument
using CDCl3 as the solvent. The IR spectra were obtained
using a Fourier transform infrared instrument. High-resolution mass
spectrometry (HRMS) analysis was carried out on a mass spectrometer
equipped with an FTMS and LTQ FT Ultra. The melting point was determined
on a Melt-Temp apparatus and was uncorrected. A slow evaporation of
the solutions of DH-1 in CHCl3–CH3OH (1:3, v/v) was employed for growing single crystals. The
X-ray crystallographic analysis was performed using the crystal of DH-1 with the size 0.33 × 0.21 × 0.17 mm3. The intensity data were collected with the ω scan mode (296
K) on a diffractometer with a CCD detector using Mo Kα radiation
(λ = 0.71073 Å). The data were corrected for Lorentz and
polarization effects, and the absorption corrections were performed
using the SADABS program.17 The crystal
structures were solved using the SHELXTL program and refined using
full-matrix least-squares.18 Further details
are deposited in the CIFs (see the Supporting Information).
