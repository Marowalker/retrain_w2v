Conventional atmospheric glycerol
organosolv pretreatment is energy-intensive
with the requirement of long time and/or high temperature. Herein,
acid-catalyzed atmospheric glycerol organosolv (ac-AGO) pretreatment
was developed under a mild condition to modify the sugarcane bagasse
structure for improving enzymatic hydrolyzability. Using single factor
and central composite design experiments, ac-AGO pretreatment was
optimized at 200 °C for 15 min with 0.06% H2SO4 addition, wherein the hemicellulose and lignin removal rates
were 82 and 52%, respectively, with extremely high cellulose retention
of 98%. The ac-AGO-pretreated substrate exhibited good enzymatic hydrolyzability
at a modest cellulase loading, affording a 70% glucose yield after
72 h. Multiple analysis tools were used to correlate the hydrolyzability
of the substrate with its structural features. The results indicated
that the mild ac-AGO pretreatment can modify the lignocellulosic biomass
structure to achieve good hydrolyzability, mainly resulting in significant
hemicellulose removal.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Lignocellulose is a promising
renewable resource that can replace
petroleum-derived fuels or decrease our dependence on them, but lignocellulosic
recalcitrance remains a significant challenge for the competitive
production of bioethanol fuel. This is because lignocellulosic plant
cell walls are composed of crystalline cellulose nanofibrils embedded
in an amorphous matrix of cross-linked lignin and hemicelluloses that
impede enzyme and microbial accessibility.1 These structures complicate the depolymerization of cellulose into
simple fermentable sugars. Therefore, development of an efficient
and environment-friendly method capable of deconstructing the recalcitrance
of lignocellulosic materials and improving the overall process for
biorefinery industries is essential.2

More than 10 years ago, the atmospheric glycerol organosolv (AGO)
pretreatment was developed by us using industrial glycerol as a cooking
solvent.3,4 The AGO pretreatment performed at 240 °C
for 4 h resulted in 95% cellulose recovery and >70% delignification,
and the pretreated wheat straw released 92% of the theoretical reducing
sugar content after 48 h of enzymatic hydrolysis.4 Modified AGO pretreatment (220 °C, 3 h) retained 98%
of the cellulose and removed >65% of the lignin from wheat straw,
resulting in 90% of enzymatic substrate hydrolysis (48 h).5 The method performed at 220 °C for 2 h removed
approximately 70% of the lignin content of sugarcane bagasse while
leaving most of the cellulose (94%) intact. In addition, the pretreated
substrate exhibited high cellulose purity (>50%), with a small
amount
of hemicellulose (<15%) and lignin (<15%).6 These earlier studies on the AGO pretreatment demonstrated
that this process exhibits notable selectivity for deconstructing
lignocellulosic biomass, significantly improving the hydrolyzability
of lignocellulosic substrates. To date, the conventional AGO pretreatment
typically involves5−7 (1) organosolv pretreatment; (2) atmospheric operation
process; (3) value-added organosolv lignin; (4) nontoxic solvent;
(5) residual solvent usable as microbial carbon source; (6) reduced
production of furan inhibitors; and (7) a bridge between bioethanol
and biodiesel production. Briefly, the glycerol is a desirable solvent
to cook the lignocellulosic feedstock in an operationally simple and
environmentally benign organosolv pretreatment process. However, the
current AGO pretreatment process is achieved autocatalytically by
catalysis of organic acids and acid derivatives produced in the reaction
system without catalyst addition, which is energy-intensive and requires
high temperatures (220–240 °C) and long reaction durations
(2–4 h). Therefore, a relatively mild AGO pretreatment process
would be beneficial for the enzyme-based lignocellulosic biorefinery
industry.

After the AGO pretreatment development, tens of similar
studies
have been performed regarding the glycerol–water organosolv
(GWO) pretreatment of various lignocellulosic biomasses.7,8 In particular, GWO pretreatment with excess acid addition has become
extremely attractive because the process can be carried out under
industrially relevant conditions similar to those for fiber pulping.9−13 Martin et al.11 showed that GWO pretreatment
at 187.7 °C for 2.3 h with 0.64% H2SO4 in
an 80% glycerol solution resulted in a maximized delignification of
53% from sugarcane bagasse, whereas the highest enzymatic hydrolysis
yield of substrates was observed at 194.1 °C, 1.67 h, and 1.1%
H2SO4. Hilares et al.12 evaluated the glycerol acid pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse and
determined the optimal pretreatment conditions of 0.15 g acid/g dried
mass, 130 °C, and 57.5 min, thereby achieving a 68.5% glucose
yield from the pretreated substrate. Ebrahimi et al.13 obtained a GWO-pretreated rice husk substrate containing
40% cellulose, 1.6% xylan, and 17.6% lignin under a selected pretreatment
condition (130 °C, 60 min, and 1.2% HCl). The acid-catalyzed
GWO pretreatment disrupted the lignocellulosic biomass recalcitrant
structure, effectively improving substrate hydrolyzability. The addition
of excess acid catalyst would likely be helpful to achieve a mild
AGO pretreatment process.

Herein, an acid-catalyzed atmospheric
glycerol organosolv (ac-AGO)
pretreatment was developed. The main variables (H2SO4 addition, pretreatment temperature, and pretreatment time)
of the ac-AGO pretreatment process were first selected with single
factor experiments, followed by optimization using central composite
design. Subsequently, the hydrolyzability of ac-AGO-pretreated sugarcane
bagasse was evaluated via batch enzymatic hydrolysis. Finally, the
susceptibility of the pretreated substrates towards enzymatic saccharification
was correlated with its structural features via characterization using
modern analytical equipment.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Construction of the ac-AGO Pretreatment Process
Numerous
studies have demonstrated that the key variables of the
process include pretreatment temperature, time, and catalyst addition
during thermochemical pretreatment.8−10 Herein, considerable
efforts were made to optimize these key variables and establish an
ideal ac-AGO pretreatment process.

2.1.1 Single
Factor Experiments
Table 1 describes the key
variables selected individually in the single factor experiments.
For the pretreatment temperature, the process reached a high pretreatment
yield (63%) at a low temperature (140 °C) owing to the significant
degradation of hemicellulose and lignin. Increasing temperature caused
an acute removal of hemicellulose, resulting in an obvious reduction
of the pretreatment yield from 63 to 56%. In addition, the cellulose
content increased from 58% (140 °C) to 67% (200 °C) with
hemicelluloses removal. When the temperature was increased to 160
°C, the pretreated biomass achieved the highest cellulose retention
of 95 with 85% hemicellulose and 29% lignin removal. Thereafter, temperatures
of >160 °C caused significant cellulose degradation and the
pretreatment
temperature of 160 °C was determined to be optimal. A long pretreatment
time resulted in low pretreatment yield where after 30 min of pretreatment,
the ac-AGO-pretreated sugarcane bagasse exhibited a high cellulose
content of 65% with a small fraction of hemicellulose (6%). Prolonging
the pretreatment resulted in an obvious cellulose loss, so 30 min
of pretreatment time was determined to be optimal for future experiments.
The addition of H2SO4 exerted a significant
effect on the substrate chemical composition. The hemicellulose content
was lowered from 12 to 2% after increasing the H2SO4 content from 0.02 to 0.1%, which was likely the main reason
for the significantly increased cellulose content (54–70%)
and slightly increased lignin content (23–29%). At 0.04% H2SO4 addition, the pretreatment showed maximum cellulose
retention of 97%, resulting in good cellulose (63%) and hemicellulose
(6%) contents of the pretreated substrate. Excess acid addition degraded
the cellulose and 0.04% H2SO4 addition was selected
for future experiments. In summary, the selected ac-AGO pretreatment
parameters were 160 °C, 30 min, and 0.04% H2SO4 addition.

2.1.2 Optimization of the ac-AGO Pretreatment
Process
To understand the effects of pretreatment temperature,
H2SO4 concentration, and time on the ac-AGO
pretreatment, a central composite design with lignin removal as the
response value was performed (Table 2). The analysis of variance showed that the model built
by the central composite design was precise and the predicted response
was reliable (Model F-value = 2.33, lack of fit F-value = 18.79%, P value < 0.05).

As shown in Figure 1, a clear interaction
between the pretreatment temperature and acid
addition, as well as between pretreatment temperature and time, whereas
no interaction between acid addition and pretreatment time was observed.
The pretreatment temperature showed the greatest influence on the
chemical composition of the pretreated sugarcane bagasse (Table 2 and Figure 1). At low temperatures, the
mild pretreatment at run 7 resulted in a low hemicellulose degradation
of 8%. In contrast, a severe pretreatment process featuring high temperature
(run 9) solubilized almost all hemicelluloses and >50% of the lignin,
resulting in significant cellulose loss. Consequently, the main variables
in the ac-AGO pretreatment process were optimized to 200 °C pretreatment
temperature, 0.06% H2SO4 addition, and 15 min
of pretreatment time, which is overlapped with run 6. Under the abovementioned
optimized conditions, the substrate after the ac-AGO pretreatment
contained 72% cellulose, 7% hemicelluloses, and 18% lignin, achieving
significant cellulose retention and 80% hemicellulose removal. The
results indicate that the ac-AGO pretreatment was capable of solubilizing
hemicelluloses effectively from the substrate without damaging the
cellulose.

the interaction of variables for lignin removal: (a) temperature and

and time at a fixed H2SO4 addition of 0.06%;

Table 3 lists main
studies on the AGO and GWO pretreatment of various lignocellulosic
biomasses. Compared with the pretreatment without acid catalysis,
acid catalysis allowed for mild pretreatment at a lower temperature
(Table 3). Interestingly,
the ac-AGO pretreatment studied herein was achieved with very dilute
acid (0.06%) at a relatively short pretreatment time (15 min), which
is of economic interest for enzyme-based lignocellulosic biorefineries.
Consequently, acid addition was helpful for constructing a mild AGO
pretreatment process typically requiring low pretreatment temperatures
and/or relatively short pretreatment times, wherein the acid action
contributed to hemicellulose removal from lignocellulosic biomass.7 In contrast, the acid-catalyzed pretreatment
resulted in a large proportion of lignin residues in the pretreated
substrate, though this was accompanied by overwhelming hemicellulose
removal.15 It is widely recognized that
high lignin content negatively affects subsequent enzymatic saccharification
of the pretreated substrates as it can physically restrict polysaccharide
accessibility and irreversibly adsorb cellulase enzymes.16−18 Moreover, large lignin residues in the pretreated substrates often
represents relatively low cellulose purity and can necessitate additional
high-solid enzymatic saccharification to supply sufficient fermentable
sugars. This tends to deteriorate the saccharification environment
with mixing and heat–mass transferring difficulty in the sticky
slurry, which is a major problem for the enzyme-based lignocellulosic
biorefining industry.19,20

2.2 Hydrolyzability
of the ac-AGO-Pretreated Sugarcane
Bagasse
It has been reported that acid-catalyzed glycerol
pretreatment enhanced the digestibility of cellulose into fermentable
sugars.11−13 Herein, the hydrolysis of the raw and ac-AGO-pretreated
sugarcane bagasse was performed at 2% solid content with different
enzyme loadings (3, 6, and 10 FPU/g dry substrate) to assess hydrolyzability.
As shown in Figure 2, the glucose yields from the hydrolysis of both substrates increased
with higher enzyme loading, indicating that the current substrate
hydrolysis was dominated by enzyme loading. Increased enzyme loading
should contribute to higher glucose yield. In terms of single substrates,
the glucose yield from raw sugarcane bagasse was <15% after 72
h at 10 FPU/g dried substrate, indicating very weak hydrolyzability.
The hydrolysis of the ac-AGO-pretreated substrates increased sharply
with hydrolysis time, resulting in an increased glucose yield from
38% at 12 h to 70% at 72 h at 10 FPU/g enzyme loading. These results
indicate that the ac-AGO-pretreated substrate released notably high
glucose titer compared to the raw feedstock at the same enzyme loading.
Furthermore, the hydrolyzability of the ac-AGO-pretreated substrates
was compared to other studies (Table 3). Similar to the other reports, the ac-AGO-pretreated
substrate obtained herein was enriched with lignin in addition to
cellulose. At 10 FPU/g cellulase loading, the glucose yields from
various pretreated substrates were relatively low (∼70%). Most
substrates exhibited >90% glucose yields at 72 h when the cellulase
loading was 20 FPU/g. These results indicate that the cellulase acting
on the substrate predominantly influenced the glucose yield. It is
likely that the ac-AGO-pretreated substrate released a significant
amount of fermentable sugars with high enzyme loadings. Thus, the
ac-AGO pretreatment effectively improved the hydrolyzability of the
sugarcane bagasse.

Figure 2 Comparison of untreated and ac-AGO treated sugarcane bagasse
at
2% dry substrate at different enzyme loadings.

2.3 Enzymatic Hydrolysis of ac-AGO-Pretreated
Sugarcane Bagasse at a High Solid Content
Recently, many
studies have demonstrated that performing enzymatic hydrolysis at
high solid contents is crucial for cost-effective and competitive
bioethanol fuel production.19,20 Therefore, the enzymatic
hydrolyzability of the ac-AGO-pretreated sugarcane bagasse was further
evaluated at 10, 12, 15, 18, and 20% solid contents with 3, 6, and
10 FPU/g cellulase (Figure 3). At 3 FPU/g enzyme loading, the substrates at 10, 12, and
15% solid contents did not liquefy for 12 h and released 29, 34, and
41 g/L of glucose at 72 h, respectively. When the solid contents were
18 and 20%, the liquefaction time of the substrate hydrolysis was
significantly delayed due to the high viscosity during the early stages
of hydrolysis, releasing 48 and 52 g/L glucose, respectively, at 70
h. With additional enzymes loading from 3 to 10 FPU/g, the glucose
titer and yield from the substrate hydrolysis at all solid contents
increased. The addition of 10 FPU/g dried substrate enabled the ac-AGO-pretreated
sugarcane bagasse at 10, 12, 15, 18, and 20% solid contents to liquefy
rapidly and produce 48, 58, 64, 78, and 82 g/L glucose, respectively,
at 72 h. This indicated that the titer of fermentable sugars released
during the enzymatic hydrolysis increased with higher solid contents.
In contrast, the glucose yield from substrate hydrolysis gradually
decreased with higher solid content at 3, 6, and 10 FPU/g. At 10 FPU/g
enzyme loading, the hydrolysis yield declined from 60 at 10% solid
content to 51 at 20% solid content. These results suggested that glucose
production was strongly dependent on the solid content regardless
of enzyme loading and hydrolysis time.19,21 Evidently,
high solid contents were beneficial for the titer of glucose released
from the substrate hydrolysis while sacrificing glucose yield. It
is likely that the high solid content would contribute to a simultaneously
desirable sugar titer and yield at very high cellulase loadings.21 However, at low cellulase loadings, the high
solid content can result in inconsistency of the glucose titer and
yield. This inconsistency is likely due to the “high-solids
effect” that reduces the mixing and heat–mass transfer
of the substrate and cellulase due to its rheological behavior.20−22 In these scenarios, a fed-batch mode, namely substrate feeding in
a stepwise manner is reasonable for the high-solids enzymatic hydrolysis
with low cellulase loading.23

at 10, 12, 15, 18, and 20% dry substrates with the addition of (a)
3 FPU/g; (b) 6 FPU/g; (c) 10 FPU/g.

Additionally, the ac-AGO-pretreated substrate contained a high
lignin content (∼20%), resulting in the following effects that
were adverse to the high-solids enzymatic hydrolysis: (1) physically
coating cellulose to impede cellulase accessibility; (2) chemically
binding the enzyme to form a nonproductive binding of cellulase; (3)
providing more substrate content to potentially supply sufficient
fermentable sugars; and (4) partially contributing to enzyme deactivation.24,25 Accordingly, strategies including extended delignification of substrates
and use of additives/accessory enzymes during enzymatic hydrolysis
are promising to reduce the high-solids effect, which is both substrate
and enzyme dependent.26−28 Briefly, the high-solids batch enzymatic hydrolysis
of substrates at low enzyme loading remains a significant challenge
for the enzyme-based lignocellulosic biorefining industry.

2.4 Structural Features
To determine
the mechanism of ac-AGO modification of the sugarcane bagasse structure
for improved hydrolyzability, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD)
were used to characterize any structural modification. SEM images
of the feedstock and ac-AGO-pretreated biomass were obtained (Figure 4). The feedstock
exhibited a smooth surface with compact fiber bundles, whereas the
ac-AGO-pretreated substrate was disrupted, distorted, and curled into
a mass, exhibiting a coarse and loose structure with an increased
specific surface area. Thus, the modified structure should be more
accessible and susceptible to the cellulases, enhancing enzymatic
hydrolysis.2,5,6 A previous
study showed that CLSM can be used to determine the distribution of
lignin on lignocellulosic biomass.29 As
shown in Figure 4,
the feedstock possessed an intact web-like structure, while the ac-AGO
pretreated substrate exhibited a significant breakage of the sclerenchyma
and middle lamella of the plant cell walls, as well as an obvious
separation of cell walls and middle lamella. The observations show
that the ac-AGO pretreatment dissociated the natural cell structure
of sugarcane bagasse, which is consistent with the above SEM images.
Compared with the feedstock, ac-AGO pretreated substrate displayed
almost the same fluorescence intensity, indicative of the substrate
still enriched with lignin. This comparison is in accordance with
the above compositional analysis.

Figure 4 SEM and CLSM images of the sugarcane bagasse
before and after ac-AGO
pretreatments.

Figure 5a shows
the TGA curve of the feedstock and ac-AGO-pretreated substrate. The
feedstock began to degrade at approximately 225 °C, with 20%
degradation at 310 °C and 75% degradation at 390 °C. The
ac-AGO-pretreated sample presented a relatively high initial decomposition
temperature of 275 °C and became 20% degraded at 365 °C
and 75% degraded at 390 °C. Thus, the ac-AGO-pretreated substrate
exhibited a much higher degradation temperature and thermal stability
due to the significant removal of constituents (i.e., hemicellulose
and lignin). The substrates before and after ac-AGO pretreatment were
also examined by FTIR spectroscopy from 4000 to 400 cm–1 (Figure 5b). After
ac-AGO pretreatment, the intensity of the C–H ester/C–O
bond at 1375 cm–1 significantly diminished, and
the peak corresponding to the COO ester bond at 1736 cm–1 weakened, indicating the dissociation of chemical bonds between
lignin and hemicellulose in the pretreated substrate. The disappeared
peaks at 1240 cm–1 (β-ether bond) and 1600
cm–1 (benzene ring of lignin) as well as the weakened
signals at 1325 cm–1 (syringyl and guaiacyl condensed
lignin) and 834 cm–1 (CH– of guaiac
lignin adsorption) indicated significant lignin removal. These results
indicate that ac-AGO pretreatment removed most hemicelluloses while
preserving the main cellulose in the sugarcane bagasse by selective
breakdown of key chemical bonds and functional groups.5,6Figure 5c shows the
XRD curves of the ac-AGO-pretreated substrate that were used to determine
crystallinity. Both curves presented major crystalline peaks at 2θ
= 16° (101), 21.9° (002), and 34.6° (040), indicating
that the crystal form of the substrate belonged to cellulose I. The
ac-AGO pretreatment method did not result in crystal transfer but
increased the crystallinity of the feedstock from 41.8 to 59.0%. The
data suggested that the amorphous components, i.e., hemicellulose
and lignin, of the sugarcane bagasse were at least partially removed
during the ac-AGO pretreatment.

pretreatments: (a) TGA;
(b) FTIR; (c) XRD.

The above described structural
features indicate that the ac-AGO
pretreatment deconstructed and modified the recalcitrant architecture
of the sugarcane bagasse. The pretreatment-dissociated key chemical
bonds (i.e., β-ether, β-ester, and hydrogen bonds) and
functional groups (i.e., syringyl and guaiacyl), resulting in micro-
and macro-structural changes in the substrates. The ac-AGO-pretreated
substrates mainly consisted of shrunken and defibrillated fibrils
with increased roughness and surface area, as well as lignin relocalization.
The structural modification of the substrate was conducive to enzymatic
hydrolysis, which is in good agreement with previous studies regarding
AGO pretreatment.5,6

3 Conclusions
A relatively mild AGO pretreatment process was developed with acid
catalysis at low temperature and short duration. The ac-AGO pretreatment
modified the lignocellulosic biomass structure towards a good hydrolyzability
by dissociation of key chemical bonds and functional groups, which
resulted in significant hemicellulose removal. The high lignin residue
in the ac-AGO-pretreated substrate is evidently adverse to the batch
enzymatic hydrolysis at high solid contents. Strategies including
extended substrate delignification, use of additives/accessory enzymes,
and fed-batch mode may compromise the high-solids effect in the high-solids
enzymatic hydrolysis of ac-AGO-pretreated substrates.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Sugarcane
bagasse, consisting
of 40.78% cellulose, 23.91% hemicelluloses, and 29.45% lignin, was
obtained from Guangxi Province, China and was manually sieved into
scraps approximately 10 mm in length. The scraps were subsequently
dried to constant weight at 105 °C and stored in polyethylene
plastic containers. Industrial glycerol (Technical grade, 99.0% purity)
was purchased from a chemical plant in Jiangsu Province, China. The
cellulase preparation Cellic CTec2 (141 FPU/g, 80 mg protein/g) was
obtained from Novozymes Investment Co. Ltd (China).

4.2 ac-AGO Pretreatment
A set of single
factor experiments were performed to optimize the three key variables
of pretreatment temperature (140–200 °C), sulfuric acid
addition (0.02–0.1%), and pretreatment time (5–40 min).
For central composite design optimization, 14 different runs were
conducted by randomization and six replicates at the central point
were performed to evaluate the pure error. The model was analyzed
using variance and statistical significance determined by F and P values. After analysis, set of
experiments were performed in triplicate to confirm the model.

In a typical run, 10 g of dry sugarcane bagasse was suspended in
a three-necked round bottom flask containing 100 g (solid/liquid ratio,
1:10 (w/w)) of industrial glycerol and a certain volume of dilute
H2SO4 solution (0.1 g/mL) in the above addition
ratio was added to the flask. The pretreatment procedure was performed
as described previously.3,6

4.3 Enzymatic
Hydrolysis
The sugarcane
bagasse feedstock (2%) and ac-AGO-pretreated substrate (2–20%
(w/v) dry substrates) were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis at three
enzyme loadings of 3, 6, and 10 FPU/g dry substrates in citrate buffer
(0.05 M, pH 4.8). The enzymatic hydrolysis mixture was incubated at
50 °C and 150 rpm in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask with a 45 mL working
volume. Samples of 0.5 mL were periodically withdrawn during hydrolysis
and centrifuged at 11 200 rpm and 4 °C for 1 min. The
supernatant was stored in the freezer (<−18 °C) prior
to glucose determination.

4.4 Structural Characterization
of the Substrates
Before analysis, all wet samples were parted
manually into smaller
fragments and dried to a constant weight at 60 °C. All characterizations
were performed according to the methods described previously.5,6 Changes in sample morphology were observed via scanning electron
microscopy (SEM; Quznfa-200, FEI, Netherlands) operated at a 10 kV
acceleration voltage, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM;
LSM 710, Zeiss, Germany). The thermal stabilities of the samples were
analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-STDA851e, Mettler-Toledo,
Switzerland). Changes in chemical bonding and functional groups before
and after ac-AGO pretreatment were determined by Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
of the sample was measured using a D8 (AXS, Germany) X-ray diffractometer
equipped with Ni-filtered Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.154
nm) at room temperature and the crystallinity index (CrI) of the samples
was calculated.

4.5 Analytical Methods
The chemical composition
of sugarcane bagasse feedstock and the ac-AGO-pretreated sugarcane
bagasse was determined using standard laboratory analytical methods.14 Acid-insoluble lignin was measured by weighing
after overnight drying at 105 °C of the residue obtained after
acid hydrolysis. The fraction of acid-insoluble ash was determined
by heating the samples at 550 °C until a constant weight was
obtained. The sugar contents in the hydrolysates were analyzed by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Japan HITACHI). The
hydrolysates were neutralized by the addition of CaCO3,
followed by dilution. All samples were passed through a G3 glass filter
(100 mL, 15–40 μm pore size) before HPLC analysis. Glucose
and xylose were quantified at 65 °C using an Aminex HPX-87H column
(300 × 7.8 mm, BioRad) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min with 5 mM
H2SO4 as the mobile phase. The pretreatment
yields and components were designated, respectively, as follows: pretreatment
yield (%) = 100 (g in insoluble solid fiber fraction)/(g in feedstock);
cellulose retention (%) = 100 (g in component of insoluble solid fiber
fraction)/(g in component of feedstock); Hemicellulose removal (delignification)
(%) = 100 (g in component of feedstock – g in component of
insoluble solid fiber fraction)/(g in component of feedstock). And
the glucose yield was used to evaluate the hydrolyzability of the
substrate, which is calculated as below: glucose yield (%) = 100 ×
0.9 (g of glucose in hydrolysate) (g of glucose in substrate). All
samples were analyzed in duplicate and the mean values were calculated
with <4% standard deviation.
