The catalytic cycle
of allylic arylation in water catalyzed by
linear polystyrene-stabilized Pd or PdO nanoparticles (PS-PdNPs or
PS-PdONPs) was investigated. Stoichiometric stepwise reactions indicated
that the reaction did not proceed stepwise on the surface of the catalyst.
In the case of the reaction with PS-PdNPs, the leached Pd species
is the catalytically active species and the reaction takes place through
a similar reaction pathway accepted in the case of a complex catalyst.
In contrast, allylic arylation using PS-PdONPs as a catalyst occurs
via a Pd(II) catalytic cycle.

Introduction
Allylic arylation of
allyl substrates with boron reagents is a
powerful tool for carbon–carbon bond formation.1−4 It is considered that the reaction proceeds in the following order:
oxidative addition of the allyl substrate to Pd(0) to form a π-allyl
palladium intermediate, transmetalation with the boron reagent, and
reductive elimination to form the coupling product. Because of the
formation of the π-allyl palladium intermediate in the first
step, the use of either linear-type (e.g., cinnamyl esters) or branch-type
(e.g., α-vinyl benzyl ester) substrates with arylboronic acid
results in the same coupling product (e.g., 1,3-diarylpropene). On
the other hand, a different mechanism for allylic arylation has been
proposed in γ-selective substitution reactions using cationic
palladium(II) species as a catalyst.5

Because transition-metal nanoparticles (NPs) are stable and exhibit
high catalytic activities for various organic reactions in water,
they have been considered to be green catalysts. Several kinds of
Pd NPs that showed high catalytic activity for allylic arylation have
been developed.6 For example, Rhee et al.
reported the allylic arylation of cinnamyl carbonates with arylboronic
acids catalyzed by Pd NPs supported on a thermoresponsive polymer
in water. The metalloenzyme-inspired polymeric imidazole Pd catalyst
(MEPI-Pd) promoted the allylic arylation of allylic acetates and carbonates
with tetraarylborates and arylboronic acids with a catalytic turn
over number of 20 000–1 250 000. In this
reaction system, 1,3-diphenylpropene was obtained from the reaction
of either cinnamyl methylcarbonate (linear-type substrate) or phenyl
vinyl carbinol carbonate (branch-type substrate) with phenylboronic
acid, indicating that the reaction proceeded through the π-allyl
palladium intermediate. The formation of 3,3-diarylpropene derivatives
(branch-type product) has not been confirmed in most cases.

Although mechanistic studies on the metal NPs-catalyzed reaction
had been focused on whether the reaction proceeds in solution or on
the surface of the NPs, a new concept of a “Cocktail”
of catalysts has been advocated recently.7 In most cases, however, the reaction pathway is thought to be the
same as that in the case of a complex catalyst. On the other hand,
we discovered that polystyrene-stabilized Pd NPs (PS-PdNPs) did not
produce coupling products in the reaction of aryl halides with aryltrimethoxysilanes
(Hiyama coupling reaction), and Hiyama coupling reaction using polystyrene-stabilized
PdO NPs (PS-PdONPs) as a catalyst proceeded through a different route
from the commonly accepted one that starts from the oxidative addition
of an aryl halide to a Pd(0) species.8 This
result suggests the reaction pathway or the reactivity of metal NPs
is different from that in the case of a metal complex catalyst. Our
continuing interest in the reactivity and mechanism of the catalytic
reaction with metal NPs led us to examine allylic arylation in water
using PS-PdNPs and PS-PdONPs as catalysts.

Results and Discussion
PS-PdNPs and PS-PdONPs were prepared using a previously reported
method8 and characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and transmission electron microscopy.9 When allylic arylation of cinnamyl methyl carbonate (linear-type
substrate) with 4-methylphenylboronic acid was carried out in 1.5
mol/L K2CO3 aqueous solution at 50 °C for
5 h using PS-PdNPs as a catalyst, 3-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylpropene
(linear-type product) and 3-(4-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropene (branch-type
product) were obtained in 68 and 31% yields, respectively (Scheme 1a). On the other
hand, only 3-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylpropene was obtained in 72%
yield from the reaction of methyl 1-phenyl-2-propenyl carbonate (branch-type
substrate) with 4-methylphenylboronic acid (Scheme 1b). Furthermore, no coupling product was
obtained in the reaction of cinnamyl acetate (linear-type substrate)
with 4-methylphenylboronic acid (Scheme 1a), and the reaction using α-vinylbenzyl
acetate (branch-type substrate) gave 3-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylpropene
(linear-type product) in 97% yield (Scheme 1b). In addition, the reaction of cinnamyl
acetate with 4-methylphenylboronic acid using PS-PdONPs as a catalyst
took place smoothly to afford both linear- and branch-type products
in 67 and 15% yields, respectively (Scheme 1c). These results suggest several routes
may exist in allylic arylation in water using metal NPs as a catalyst.

Scheme 1 Allylic Arylation Using PS–Pd (or PdO) NPs in Water
To gain insight into the reaction mechanism
of allylic arylation,
stoichiometric stepwise reactions were performed (Scheme 2). Solid (ReCat) and aqueous solution (Sol) were separated after the
reaction of PS-PdNPs with 4-methylphenylboronic acid (or α-vinylbenzyl
acetate). When ReCat was washed with water and diethyl
ether, and then reacted with the other compound (α-vinylbenzyl
acetate or 4-methylphenylboronic acid), no coupling product was obtained
in either case. In contrast, 3-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylpropene was
obtained after heating the mixture of Sol-1 and α-vinylbenzyl
acetate (8% yield) or Sol-2 in the presence of α-vinylbenzyl
acetate and 4-methylphenylboronic acid (68% yield).10 These results are consistent with the fact that Pd species
were detected in the solution phase after stirring the K2CO3 aqueous solution in the presence of PS-PdNPs with
4-methylphenylboronic acid or α-vinylbenzyl acetate (Table 1). Indeed, a 99% yield
of the coupling product was obtained from the reaction of α-vinylbenzyl
acetate with 4-methylphenylboronic acid in the presence of a water-soluble
Pd species, which was prepared by dissolving Pd(OAc)2 in
1.5 mol/L K2CO3 aqueous solution (Scheme 3).11 However, no Pd species was detected in the solution phase at middle
of the reaction and after the catalytic reaction, indicating that
the Pd species were restabilized by linear polystyrene immediately.12 If Pd leaching occurred after oxidative addition
of α-vinylbenzyl acetate, the reaction of the leached Pd species
with 4-methylphenylboronic acid would give the coupling product because
the allyl moiety is on Pd. However, no coupling product was obtained
from the mixture of Sol-2 and 4-methylphenylboronic acid
(Scheme 2), suggesting
that the allylic substrate does not involve in Pd leaching.

Because
no correlation between the yield of the coupling product
and the reaction time was observed (Figure S6) when the reaction was monitored by 1H NMR, the reaction
profile was investigated after preheating at 50 °C for 1 h (Figure 1). Little change
in the yield of the product was observed in allylic arylation using
different amounts of α-vinylbenzyl acetate and 4-methylphenylboronic
acid, suggesting that leaching of the Pd species into the reaction
solution is the rate-determining step. In addition, little increase
of the product yield was confirmed in the hot filtration test after
preheating.13 This result is consistent
with the assumption that the leached Pd species are restabilized by
linear polystyrene immediately.

Figure 1 Reaction profile for allylic arylation
after preheating.

According to these results,
a reaction mechanism is the same as
a “Cocktail” of catalysts and that in the case of a
complex catalyst,14 that is, Pd species
leach into the reaction medium, and then the allylic arylation takes
place in the solution phase. After the corresponding product form
via reductive elimination, leached Pd species are restabilized on
the surface of the catalyst. Indeed, when the reaction of (2S,3E)-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-yl acetate with
4-methylphenylboronic acid was performed in the presence of PS-PdNPs
as a catalyst, (3R,1E)-3-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenyl-1-butene
was obtained in 75% yield with 91% enantioselectivity (eq 1). This result is consistent with
the plausible reaction pathway shown in Scheme 4. 1  

Scheme 4 Plausible Mechanism for Allylic Arylation
Using PS-PdNPs as a Catalyst
As shown in Scheme 1a, no coupling product was obtained from the reaction of cinnamyl
acetate with 4-methylphenylboronic acid using PS-PdNPs as a catalyst,
although the reaction took place in the case of cinnamyl methyl carbonate
or α-vinylbenzyl acetate. These differences would be attributable
to the reactivity of these substrates.15 On the other hand, the reaction of cinnamyl acetate with 4-methylphenylboronic
acid using PS-PdONPs as a catalyst (Scheme 1c) afforded the coupling product, indicating
the existence of another reaction pathway. In order to confirm the
reaction route using PS-PdONPs as a catalyst, stoichiometric stepwise
reactions were performed (Scheme 5). The catalyst was separated from the solution after
the reaction of PS-PdONPs with 4-methylphenylboronic acid (or cinnamyl
acetate) and then reacted with the other compound (cinnamyl acetate
or 4-methylphenylboronic acid).16 No formation
of the coupling product was confirmed in either case, suggesting that
the reaction did not proceed stepwise on the surface of the catalyst.
Although the coupling product was not obtained after heating the filtrate
(Sol-3) in the presence of cinnamyl acetate, the reaction
of cinnamyl acetate with 4-methylphenylboronic acid in the filtrate
(Sol-4) gave 3-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylpropene (linear-type
product) and 3-(4-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropene (branch-type product)
in 7 and 3% yields, respectively. When using a water-soluble Pd species
as a catalyst, the yield of the coupling product was very low (Scheme 6), and no coupling
product was obtained in the hot filtration test (Scheme 7). These results suggest that
the leached Pd species is not the catalytically active species in
this reaction system.

When the reaction profile was monitored using various
amounts of
cinnamyl acetate, the product yield was decreased with an increase
in the amounts of cinnamyl acetate at the beginning of the reaction
(Figure 2). In contrast,
the product yield was increased with increasing amount of 4-methylphenylboronic
acid (Figure 3). The
final yield of the product was 62% when using 1.0 mmol of 4-methylphenylboronic
acid, likely due to the formation of Pd(0) species on the surface
of the catalyst.17

allylic arylation with various amounts of
cinnamyl acetate using PS-PdONPs as a catalyst.

Figure 3 Reaction
profile for allylic arylation with various amounts of
4-methylphenylboronic acid using PS-PdONPs as a catalyst.

From the results of the preheating experiments (Scheme 8), it was confirmed
that the
catalyst was not activated by 4-methylphenylboronic acid. Electron-rich
cinnamyl acetate derivatives reacted more efficiently than electron-deficient
ones (Table 2, entries
1–4).The existence of an electron-donating substituent on the
aryl ring of the arylboronic acid accelerated the reaction because
of the increase in nucleophilicity (entries 2 and 5–7). When
the catalyst was reacted with cinnamyl acetate after the phenyl group
was modified on the surface of the catalyst by the treatment with
phenyl(trimethoxy)silane,8a no coupling
product was observed (Scheme 9). This result is consistent with the assumption that the
reaction does not proceed stepwise on the surface of the catalyst.
In addition, considering the results in Schemes 5 and 6, the reaction
takes place via a concerted mechanism on the surface of the catalyst.

When the reaction
profiles were investigated using the variable-time
normalization analysis graphical methods18 to gain further information on the mechanism of this reaction, an
order of 1.0 for Pd and an order of 2.5 for arylboronic acid were
obtained (Schemes S10 and S11).

A
plausible reaction pathway is shown in Scheme 10. After coordination of the substrate onto
the Pd(II) surface, nucleophilic attack of arylboronic acid (SN2 or SN2′) occurs to give the coupling product.
Arylboronic acid would also function as a Lewis-acid catalyst to activate
allylic acetate.19 The order over two in
arylboronic acid is consistent with the hypothesis that arylboronic
acid acts as both of a nucleophile and a Lewis acid. In addition,
the reason why the product yield was decreased with an increase in
the amounts of cinnamyl acetate is arylboronic acid would act only
as a Lewis-acid catalyst when more amount of substrate was used. The
preheating experiment in the presence of arylboronic acid gave lower
yield than the experiment in which only the catalyst was preheated
(Scheme 8), suggesting
transmetalation step do not involve in this reaction route. When the
reaction of (2S,3E)-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-yl
acetate with 4-methylphenylboronic acid was performed in the presence
of PS-PdONPs as a catalyst at 50 °C, the coupling product was
obtained in 91% yield with 80% ee (eq 2).20 Although the enantioselectivity
was slightly lower (81%), this result is consistent with the proposed
reaction pathway. 2

Conclusions
In
summary, the reaction mechanism for allylic arylation in water
using polystyrene-stabilized Pd or PdO NPs as the catalyst was investigated.
In the case of substrates that have higher reactivity for oxidative
addition to Pd(0) species, allylic arylation took place smoothly using
PS-PdNPs as a catalyst. On the other hand, allylic substrates with
lower reactivity for oxidative addition reacted with arylboronic acid
in the presence of PS-PdONPs. Stoichiometric stepwise reactions indicated
that the reaction did not proceed stepwise on the surface of the catalyst.
In the case of the reaction with PS-PdNPs, leaching of Pd species
into the reaction solution was the rate-determining step, and the
reaction took place through the commonly accepted route starting from
the oxidative addition of the allylic substrate. In contrast, allylic
arylation using PS-PdONPs as a catalyst occurred by nucleophilic attack
of arylboronic acid after coordination of the Pd(II) species to the
alkene moiety. Further investigations on the reaction mechanism are
underway in our laboratory.

Experimental Section
A 400 MHz NMR
spectrometer (ECZ400S, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was
used for 1H NMR spectra in CDCl3 with TMS (δ
= 0) as an internal standard. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission
spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was performed using ICPS-8100 (Shimadzu Co.,
Kyoto, Japan). A JEM 2100F transmission electron microscope (JEOL
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used for investigation of Pd NPs. The samples
were prepared by placing a drop of the solution on carbon-coated copper
grids and allowed to dry in air. A Rigaku RINT 2500 diffractometer
(Cu Kα radiation) equipped with a monochromator was used for
powder XRDs. Polystyrene of narrow molecular weight distribution standards
and Pd(OAc)2 were purchased from Tosoh Co., Ltd. (Tokyo,
Japan) and Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Missouri, USA), respectively.

Preparation
of PS-PdNPs8b
A stirring bar,
13 mg of polystyrene (0.13 mmol of styrene unit),
Pd(OAc)2 8.4 mg (37 μmol), 4-methylphenylboronic
acid 0.012 g (88 μmol), and 1.5 mol·L–1 aqueous KOH solution (3 mL) were added to a screw-capped vial. The
aqueous solution was removed after stirring at 90 °C for 5 h.
Subsequently, the polystyrene stabilized Pd NPs were washed with water
(5 × 3.0 mL), MeOH (1 × 3.0 mL), and Et2O (5
× 3.0 mL). The loading of Pd (2.51 mmol/g) was confirmed by ICP-AES
analysis.

Preparation of PS-PdONPs8a
A stirring bar, 13 mg of polystyrene (0.13 mmol of styrene unit),
Pd(OAc)2 8.4 mg (37 μmol), and 1.5 mol·L–1 aqueous K2CO3 solution (2 mL)
were added to a screw-capped vial. The aqueous solution was removed
after stirring at 90 °C for 5 h. Subsequently, the polystyrene
stabilized PdO NPs were washed with water (5 × 3.0 mL), MeOH
(1 × 3.0 mL), and Et2O (5 × 3.0 mL). The loading
of Pd (2.48 mmol/g) was confirmed by ICP-AES analysis.

Typical Procedures
for Stepwise Experiments8a
A stirring
bar, PS-PdNPs (200 mg, 0.50 mmol of
Pd), 4-methylphenylboronic acid (68 mg, 0.50 mmol), and 1.5 mol·L–1 aqueous K2CO3 solution (2 mL)
were added to a screw-capped vial. After the mixture was stirred at
50 °C for 5 h, the aqueous phase (Sol-1) was transferred
to the other screw-capped vial. In order to remove the residual 4-methylphenylboronic
acid, the recovered catalyst (ReCat-1) was washed with
H2O (3 × 3.0 mL) and diethyl ether (3 × 3.0 mL).
α-Vinylbenzyl acetate (88 mg, 0.50 mmol) and 1.5 mol·L–1 aqueous K2CO3 solution (2 mL)
were added to a screw-capped vial including ReCat-1;
the mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 22.5 h. After separating
the catalyst and the aqueous phase, the recovered catalyst was washed
with H2O (3 × 3.0 mL) and diethyl ether (3 ×
3.0 mL), which were then added to the aqueous phase. The aqueous phase
was extracted with diethyl ether (8 × 5.0 mL). The combined organic
extracts were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated with an
evaporator. On the other hand, the aqueous phase (Sol-1) was filtered with a membrane filter and stirred at 50 °C for
18 h after addition of α-vinylbenzyl acetate (88 mg, 0.50 mmol).
After the mixture was extracted with diethyl ether (8 × 5.0 mL),
the organic extracts were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated
with an evaporator.

Typical Procedures for Leaching Tests8a
A stirring bar, PS-PdNPs (3.0 mg, 7.5
μmol of Pd),
α-vinylbenzyl acetate (88 mg, 0.50 mmol), and 1.5 mol·L–1 aqueous K2CO3 solution (1 mL)
were added to a screw-capped vial. After stirring at 50 °C for
5 h, the aqueous phase was filtered with a membrane filter and adjusted
to 10 mL by hydrochloric acid (1.0 mol·L–1).
The amount of Pd metal (2.3 ppm) was confirmed by ICP-AES analysis.

General Procedure for Allylic Arylation
A stirring
bar, α-vinylbenzyl acetate (88 mg, 0.5 mmol), 4-methylphenylboronic
acid (102 mg, 0.75 mmol), PS-PdNPs (1.0 mg, 0.5 mol % of Pd), and
1.5 mol·L–1 aqueous K2CO3 solution (1 mL) were added to a screw-capped vial. After the mixture
was stirred at 50 °C for 5 h, the catalyst and the aqueous phase
were separated. The recovered catalyst was washed with H2O (5 × 3.0 mL) and diethyl ether (5 × 3.0 mL), which were
then added to the aqueous phase. The aqueous phase was extracted with
diethyl ether (8 × 5.0 mL). The combined organic extracts were
dried over MgSO4 and concentrated with an evaporator. 3-(4-Methylphenyl)-1-phenylpropene
was obtained after silica-gel column chromatography in 97% yield.

α-Vinylbenzyl
acetate was removed completely
by membrane filter and did not be detected in the solution phase (Sol-2).


The reaction
of cinnamyl methyl carbonate
with 4-methylphenylboronic acid also took place in the presence of
a water-soluble Pd species to give 3-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylpropene
(linear-type product) and 3-(4-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropene (branch-type
product) in 69 and 14% yields, respectively.


PS-PdNPs was easily reused with no loss of
activity and the size of PdNPs did not change after the recycling
experiment (Scheme S1 and Figure S5).


The reaction
of α-vinylbenzyl acetate
(0.5 mmol) with 4-methylphenylboronic acid (0.5 mmol) was performed
for 1 h after pre-heating to give 3-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylpropene
in 9% yield (Figure 1). When the catalyst was removed from the reaction mixture after
1 h reaction and then the filtrate was heated at 50 °C for 4
h in the presence of α-vinylbenzyl acetate, 13% of coupling
product was obtained.


A similar
mechanism has been proposed for
the allylic arylation catalyzed by in-situ generated Pd nanoparticles.

The first reaction of
PS-PdONPs with 4-methylphenylboronic
acid was performed at 25 °C because the reduction of PdONPs to
PdNPs with the formation of 4,4′-dimethylbiphenyl is easy to
occur at 50 °C.


The
activity of the catalyst (PS-PdONPs)
was decreased after recycling experiment and the formation of Pd(0)
was confirmed by XPS analysis of the recovered catalyst (Scheme S2 and Figure S7). In addition, the size of nanoparticles in the recovered catalyst
was a slightly bigger than that in the fresh PS-PdONPs (Figure S8).

the racemic
mixture of coupling product were obtained in 85% yield.
