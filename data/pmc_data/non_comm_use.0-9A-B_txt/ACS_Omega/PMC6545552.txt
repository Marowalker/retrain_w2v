The electrochemical
splitting of water provides an elegant way
to store renewable energy, but it is limited by the cost of the noble
metals used as catalysts. Among the catalysts used for the reduction
of water to hydrogen, MoS2 has been identified as one of
the most promising materials as it can be engineered to provide not
only a large surface area but also an abundance of unsaturated and
reactive coordination sites. Using Mo[NMe2]4 and H2S as precursors, a desired thickness of amorphous
MoS2 can be deposited on TiO2 nanotubes by atomic
layer deposition. The identity and structure of the MoS2 film are confirmed by spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic performance of MoS2 is quantified as it depends on the tube length and the MoS2 layer thickness through voltammetry, steady-state chronoamperometry,
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The best sample reaches
10 mA/cm2 current density at 189 mV overpotential in 0.5
M H2SO4. All of the various geometries of our
nanostructured electrodes reach an electrocatalytic proficiency comparable
with the state-of-the-art MoS2 electrodes, and the dependence
of performance parameters on geometry suggests that the system can
even be improved further.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
increasing environmental issues caused by the release of CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels creates an urgent need
to develop a renewable, sustainable, and clean energy source to replace
the current energy system dominated by fossil fuels.1 Compared with carbon-based fossil fuels, hydrogen can theoretically
be a carbon-free energy carrier as its only combustion product is
water. However, hydrogen is mainly produced by steam reforming of
natural gas, which does produce CO2.2 A promising alternative method of producing hydrogen in
a carbon-neutral manner is the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical
water splitting.3−5

Losses during energy storage in the fuel H2 (and its
counterpart O2) are caused primarily by the electrodes’
overpotentials required to perform each half-reaction at a practically
useful rate. The minimization of overpotentials is achieved by using
catalysts, the best of which currently consist of noble metals, specifically
platinum and its alloys for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).6−9 However, their wide-scale application is limited by their scarcity
and high cost. Alternatives based on non-noble metals, usually in
compounds such as oxides, heavier chalcogenides or even pnictides,
have not achieved catalytic performance and durability at high potential
on par with their metallic counterparts so far.10−12 Therefore,
efficient and stable catalysts based on earth-abundant, inexpensive
transition metals remain to be found.4 Recently,
molybdenum sulfide has attracted significant attention as a promising
alternative to the noble metal catalysts due to its low cost and long-term
stability as well as the abundance of the elements molybdenum and
sulfur in the earth crust.13−16

Significant work has been dedicated to the
HER electrocatalytic
activity of crystalline and amorphous MoS2 and has highlighted
their respective advantages and drawbacks. For crystalline MoS2, both experimental data and theoretical calculations show
that the edge sites in the layered structure mostly determine the
catalytic performance.17−20 One approach to increasing the number of active edge sites has consisted
in the engineering of nanostructured MoS2, for example,
as MoS2 nanosheets,21−23 MoS2 nanoparticles,24−26 mesoporous MoS2,27 and MoS2 thin films.28,29 In comparison to this, amorphous
MoS2 features an enhanced overall electrode activity toward
HER owing to its higher density of defect sites.30 In the case of amorphous MoS2, as well, a number
of studies have been devoted to nanostructuring aimed at increasing
the surface area while maintaining sufficient electrical conductivity.31−34 A highly porous structure typically features long electron transport
distances, which can cause resistive (Ohmic) losses.35,36

Titanium oxide nanotube arrays (TNTAs) are a type of vertically
aligned, highly ordered, high-surface area nanostructure that can
be economically fabricated by anodic anodization of titanium metal.37−40 Recently, TNTAs have been used in combination with MoS2 materials fabricated by a variety of methods, such as hydrothermal
synthesis, Mo sulfurization, and electrochemical deposition, to build
heterostructures for water splitting.41−43 The highly ordered tubular
structure not only increases the number of active sites exposed to
the electrolyte, it can also facilitate reactant supply and product
removal along straight pores with respect to typical powder-based
catalyst beds featuring long diffusion paths along disordered pores.
However, those MoS2 synthesis methods are not able to coat
the highly tubular TNTAs with an accurate control of the MoS2 loading.

Thus, the present work focuses on atomic layer deposition
(ALD)
as a method to produce molybdenum sulfide. We use TNTAs as a substrate,
tune the length of the tubes via the anodization duration, coat the
substrate with amorphous MoS2 through atomic layer deposition,
and investigate the geometric effect and catalyst thickness influence
on the electrocatalytic HER performance of amorphous MoS2.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Molybdenum
Sulfide Atomic Layer Deposition
(ALD) on Planar and Nanostructured Substrates
Atomic layer
deposition (ALD) is a thin-film deposition technique based on sequential
reactions of volatile precursors with a solid surface, each of which
behaves in a self-limiting manner.44 This
self-limiting surface chemistry renders ALD uniquely suited to depositing
a precise thickness of continuous and pinhole-free coating in deep
pores.45

Here, we first characterize
the ALD of molybdenum sulfide from Mo[NMe2]4 and H2S (3% in N2) on the piezoelectric GaPO4 crystal microbalance of a small reactor used for method development
and on planar Si wafers.46,47Figure 1a shows that the thickness t of the molybdenum sulfide film deposited increases in a linear relationship
with the number N of cycles performed at 95 °C.
According to the thickness measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry,
the growth per cycle is approximately 2.5 Å. This rather large
value corresponds to nearly half of a MoS2 monolayer. The
self-limiting behavior of the surface reactions is demonstrated by
the piezoelectric microbalance data of Figure 1b, which evidences saturation with dose.
During each ALD cycle (except the first), the Mo[NMe2]4 precursor reacts in a self-limiting way with the −SH
reactive groups terminating the substrate’s surface and leaves
a dimethylamide termination. In the subsequent step, these amide groups
are released by H2S and the surface reverts to the original
−SH termination. A closer look at the piezoelectric microbalance
curve shape within one cycle (Figure 1c) evidences a nonideal behavior, in which the frequency
does not revert to a stable value after each pulse. However, we have
checked that varying the purge duration does not affect the growth
rate. Thus, we interpret this behavior as due to factors that affect
the crystal’s eigenfrequency beyond mass, such as thermal and
strain effects.

(thickness

batches of samples are represented in three distinct colors. (b) Saturation
curve of the MoS2 growth dependent on the molybdenum precursor
pulse duration, and (inset) in situ piezoelectric microbalance growth
curve when the Mo[NMe2]4 and H2S
pulse durations are set to 20 and 2 ms, respectively. (c) A zoom-in
view of three ALD cycles (one cycle being highlighted in light blue
color in (b) and (c)). The timing of both precursor pulses within
this cycle is shown by arrows.

The ALD recipe is then applied to coating annealed TNTA substrates
with molybdenum sulfide in a larger reactor. The pulse and purge durations
are adapted to the larger chamber volume, whereas the temperatures
are maintained. The TNTAs are obtained by the anodization of Ti foil,
whereby various tube lengths are achieved by various anodization durations,
as shown in Figure 2. More specifically, tubes of 7.8, 13.6, and 17.9 μm are obtained
after 1, 2, and 3 h of anodization at 60 V, respectively. The tubes’
inner diameter remains constant at approximately 100 nm near the surface. Figure 3 shows top-view scanning
electron micrographs of a TNTA sample before and after molybdenum
sulfide coating. Evidence of the material coating on the top surface
is clear from the fact that tube walls appear thicker after ALD. Coating
into the depths of the pores is covered later.

2.2 Characterization
of the Molybdenum Sulfide
Deposit
The chemical identity of the deposit is determined
by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis recorded on
the top of a sample as shown in Figure 3: Mo and S signals are present in an atomic ratio that
integrates to around 1 to 2 despite the limitation inherent to their
spectral overlap (Figure 4). When an EDX profile is recorded along the tubes’
length, the 1:2 ratio is maintained (Figure 5). The absolute signal intensity of these
two elements, however, decays from the surface down to the depth of
7.8 μm (1 h of anodization). This signal decline of Mo and S
from the top to the bottom could be due to two effects. First, the
“V” shape of the TiO2 nanotubes is known
to generate a decrease of surface area with depth.48 The inner tube diameter becoming smaller and smaller from
the top to the bottom causes the intensity increase of the Ti signal
observed in Figure 5. A second effect could be due to the limited vapor pressure of Mo[NMe2]4 available and transport limitation along the
deep tubes’ length.

signal in green, and sulfur and molybdenum signals (overlapped) in

sample coated with MoS2 (80 ALD cycles), investigated in
cross section. The carbon signal (from the conductive tape) serves
to identify the total pore length (7.8 μm).

Regular X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigation of the MoS2/TNTA samples exhibits large, sharp anatase peaks and no MoS2 signals (Figure S1). To look for
potentially broad and weak MoS2 signals, we turn to grazing-incidence
XRD measurements of approximately 20 nm MoS2 on a planar
glass (Figure 6). The
patterns of the glass substrate both before and after MoS2 coating glass show no peak. This establishes that the ALD material
is amorphous, at least when deposited at 95 °C.

diffraction patterns of a glass slide coated
with 20 nm of MoS2 (black line) and uncoated glass
(red line).

Further insight into
the surface chemical composition and valence state of the MoS2 deposit on TNTAs
is provided by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis. Figure 7a shows the high-resolution XPS data in the Mo 3d region. It can
be fitted with two major contributions attributed to MoS2 (with Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 peaks at 229.7
and 232.9 eV, respectively) and to Mo5+ (as already described
for the edge states in nanocrystalline molybdenum sulfides, with Mo
3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 at 230.8 and 234.0 eV where
such Mo5+ states are mainly found at the edge of MoS2 crystals under a sulfur-rich environment).49 A doublet at still higher energy is also present and characteristic
of oxygen-bonded Mo (“MoO3” with Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 at 233.0 and 236.1 eV), probably
formed by superficial oxidation of the MoS2 layer in contact
with air. Correspondingly, the S 2p shown in Figure 7b indicates that sulfur is mainly present
as molybdenum sulfide with the S 2p3/2 + S 2p1/2 doublet at 162.5 and 163.6 eV. A shoulder at higher energy (S 2p3/2 + S 2p1/2 at 163.8 and 164.9 eV) can be attributed
to the presence of S–S bonds (in polysulfides). A trace amount
of sulfates is also observed (S 2p3/2 + S 2p1/2 doublet at 169.0 and 170.1 eV). This corresponds to the superficial
aerobic oxidation of MoS2 or to an artifact of sputtering.
Note that sputtering does reduce the oxide signals (see the Mo 3d
region XPS data recorded without sputtering for comparison, Figure S2).

2.3 Electrochemical
Investigation
The
electrocatalytic activity of nanostructured MoS2 toward
the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was investigated using a three-electrode
system with 0.1 M H2SO4 as electrolyte. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) was performed on MoS2-coated TNTA electrodes
between −0.8 and +0.2 V versus a standard hydrogen electrode
(SHE) at a scan rate of 50 mV/s (Figure 8) first. From the CV, we can observe a significant
cathodic current density starting at −0.23 V, corresponding
to the onset of the hydrogen evolution reaction. The increasing current
density also materializes in a continuous generation of bubbles from
the electrolyte. The linear shape of the current density curve with
increase of the applied potential beyond (below) −0.3 V deviates
from the exponential function expected of the pure electrocatalytic
case and is due to the Ohmic resistance of the electrode substrate.
No additional signals appear down to overpotential of 800 mV, and
the curve is reversible except for a slight hysteresis. These observations
are indicative of the stability of our MoS2 catalyst in
the acidic electrolyte and the capacitive behavior associated with
its enhanced surface area.

Figure 8 Cyclic voltammogram of an electrode consisting
of 7.8 μm
long TNTAs coated with MoS2 (80 ALD cycles), from −0.8
V (vs SHE) to +0.2 V (vs SHE). Scan rate: 50 mV/s, step size: 2 mV,
and electrode area: 0.0314 cm2.

In the next step, we further investigate the effect of the
TiO2 tube length and the thickness of the MoS2 catalyst
layer toward the electrocatalytic performance of the electrodes. Cyclic
voltammetry and steady-state chronoamperometry were performed for
a series of TNTAs featuring tubes of various lengths (between 7.8
and 17.9 μm) and decorated with different MoS2 thicknesses
(from 7.5 to 20 nm). The voltammograms displayed in Figure 9a,b show the influence of the
MoS2 catalyst’s thickness on both planar and nanostructured
electrodes. From these two graphs, the activity of MoS2 as a catalyst (as opposed to the naked TiO2 substrate)
is obvious in both the planar and nanotubular cases (compare colored
and black curves within Figure 9a and within Figure 9b). Furthermore, the beneficial effect of increased surface
area caused by the porous geometry appears clearly (upon comparing Figure 9a with 9b). Although increasing the MoS2 layer thickness
from 7.5 to 12.5 and 20 nm does generate a slight current density
increase at −0.45 V, the relationship is by far not proportional.
This observation corresponds to a surface reaction and proves that
the MoS2 deposit is dense (albeit amorphous), with a beneficial
effect of a slight surface roughness. This further implies that the
catalyst loading can be minimized without a significant loss of activity.

Figure 9 Effect
of the MoS2 thickness (a, b) and tubes length
(c, d) on electrocatalytic HER performance. Cyclic voltammograms performed
on electrodes consisting of (a) planar TiO2; (b) TNTAs
(anodized for 1 h) coated with various amounts of MoS2 (0,
30, 50, and 80 cycles); (c) planar TiO2 and TNTAs (anodized
for 1, 2, and 3 h) without coating; (d) same substrates after coating
with MoS2 (30 ALD cycles). Scan rate: 50 mV/s, step size:
2 mV, and electrode area: 0.0314 cm2, performed in 0.1
M H2SO4 electrolyte.

The effect of the TiO2 tube length is presented
in Figure 9c,d. In
the absence
of a catalyst (Figure 9c), the tube length increases are associated with corresponding increases
in the capacitive current (hysteretic behavior of the voltammetric
curve), indicating that the full sample surface is in electrochemical
contact with the electrolyte. The enhanced surface area of the nanotubular
samples proves to be beneficial with respect to the planar counterparts
in Figure 9d. However,
pore length increases beyond 7.8 μm do not result in any current
density improvements. This observation allows us to conclude that
the EDX profile discussed in Figure 5 is likely due to incomplete coating of long tubes.

The systematic increase in electrocatalytic performance from planar
to structured samples and from inert to MoS2-coated ones
can be expressed as a corresponding decrease in the charge-transfer
resistance (Rct) at the electrolyte/electrode
interface. This parameter is related to the inherent catalytic activity
of the electrodes, and it is associated with the diameter of the semicircle
determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the Nyquist
plots (Figure 10).
In the planar case, adding MoS2 as the HER catalyst reduces
electrolyte/electrode interface Rct from
85 to 3.3 kΩ approximately whereas the geometric effect of the
nanotubular structure further improves Rct to around 164 Ω. Figure 11 shows the steady-state current densities obtained
for our various samples over 30 min of bulk electrolysis. Not only
are all trends observed in voltammetry reproduced in the steady state
but the current densities obtained here remain high (on the same order
of magnitude as on the CV curves). Furthermore, these data are indicative
of an excellent stability in the corrosive electrolyte. Let us now
characterize their stability further.

TNTAs of different lengths coated by various amounts of
MoS2: 0 ALD cycle (black), 30 cycles (red), 50 cycles (blue),
and 80 cycles (green). Measurement conditions: 0.1 M H2SO4 at −0.5 V vs SHE.

2.4 Stability of the Electrodes
The current–time
curve recorded on a nanotubular MoS2 electrode held at
an overpotential of 450 mV for 36 h quantifies its high durability
and long-term stability (Figure 12). The current remains constant during the whole experiment
apart from the noiselike variations occuring due to the bubble formation.
A crystalline anatase substrate is a crucial prerequisite for this
high stability, as shown in Figure S3.
Not only is the anatase phase of TiO2 more conductive electrically
than its amorphous counterpart but more importantly, TNTA samples
that have not been annealed (and are correspondingly amorphous) are
destroyed upon electrochemical treatment. Annealed TNTA samples, in
contrast to this, display unaffected tube structures after tens of
hours of continuous electrolysis. Figures S4 and S5 also show no change in the chemical composition and crystalline
structure after electrolysis. Compared with the reported works, the
stability of our MoS2-coated TNTA electrodes is among one
of the best.13−16

anodization for 1 h and coated with MoS2 (80 ALD cycles),
recorded under η = 450 mV in 0.1 M H2SO4.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have established a robust type of electrode based
on anatase TiO2 nanotubes coated with MoS2 by
ALD. Compared with planar samples, the nanotubular geometry serves
to improve the electrocatalytic performance due to their larger surface
area and concomitantly higher number of active sites. The presence
of MoS2 allows for steady-state current densities beyond
50 mA/cm2 to be obtained for the HER (at 500 mV overpotential).
A more direct comparison with literature values is performed in a
0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte considered standard
in some recent papers (Figure 13).50−55 In a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte at 50 mV/s, our
electrode consisting of nanotubular TiO2 coated with MoS2 (80 ALD cycles) reaches the current density of 10 mA/cm2 at an overpotential of η = 189 mV with a low catalyst
loading (∼1.2 mg/cm2), which represents an improvement
with respect to the state-of-the-art electrode (Table 1).50−55 In future, we can reduce the thickness of the ALD layer and thereby
the loading of MoS2. Our data indicate that loadings below
0.5 mg/cm2 (30 cycles coating) will yield similar current
densities. Thus, applications such as photoelectrochemical ones can
be pursued with minimized catalyst cost and with an ease of adjustment
(based on geometric parameters) unmatched by other systems.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
All
chemicals are of analytical
reagent grade and were used as received without any further purification.
NH4F, ethylene glycol, concentrated phosphoric acid, and
sulfuric acid were obtained from Acros Organics (Germany), VWR (Germany).
Titanium foils were purchased from Advent Research Materials Ltd (England).
The silicon wafer with approximately 200 nm silicon oxide on the top
was supplied by Silicon Materials Inc. H2S (3% in N2) was ordered from Air Liquid (Germany). The molybdenum precursor
(Mo[NMe2]4) was synthesized according to the
published procedure.56

4.2 Fabrication of the TiO2 Nanotubes
Arrays and Planar TiO2 Substrates
The TNTAs were
fabricated by titanium anodic anodization according to ref (39). The titanium foil was
sonicated successively in acetone, ethanol, and water for 15 min,
respectively, and then dried under N2 flow. Afterward,
the clean foil was bound to the homemade electrolytic cell with silver
mesh serving as the counter electrode. The anodization was carried
out at 60 V for 1, 2, and 3 h in the electrolyte consisted of ethylene
glycol, 5% (vol %) H2O and 0.5% (wt %) NH4F
to obtain the vertically aligned different lengths of TiO2 tubes on the metallic Ti foil. Thereafter, the TiO2 nanotubular
membrane was cleaned with distilled water and dried at 45 °C
overnight. Afterward, the membrane was sonicated in 20% (vol %) acetic
acid for 10–20 min to remove the disordered top layer covering
the top side of the membrane. The planar TiO2 substrates
were also made via Ti anodization according to ref (40). The clean Ti foil was
anodized at 60 V in a fluoride-free electrolyte (5 wt % H3PO4 solution in ethylene glycol) for 20 min to obtain
a thin layer of planar compact TiO2 on the Ti surface.

4.3 MoS2 Atomic Layer Deposition
The deposition of MoS2 on planar and TNTA substrates
was performed on a homemade ALD reactor by using Mo[NMe2]4 as the molybdenum precursor and H2S as the
sulfur source based on refs (46) and (47). The molybdenum precursor was heated up to 65 °C, and the reactor
chamber was kept at 95 °C. For the deposition on planar substrates,
a 0.7 s pulse of the molybdenum precursor was first inserted into
the chamber and stayed in the chamber for 20 s (exposure time) to
let the precursor react with the wafer and planar TiO2 surface;
then, the molybdenum precursor was flushed away completely by 40 s
of pumping (pumping time). In the next step, a 0.2 s H2S pulse was introduced to the chamber and reacted with the molybdenum
precursor for 20 s and the remaining H2S was also pumped
away (40 s). Through the repeated, nonoverlapping exposure to the
two precursors, a thin film of MoS2 was slowly deposited.
For the deposition on TNTA substrates, we used a different 50 s exposure
time and 60 s pumping time for both precursors since a longer time
is needed for the precursors to reach the extremity of the tube.

4.4 Characterization
The samples were
characterized by the X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Advance, Germany)
with a Cu Kα source and a LynxEye XE T detector, a field emission
electron microscope (Zeiss Merlin, Germany) equipped with Oxford Instruments
INCA A-Act EDX system, and monochromatized Al Kα X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (PHI Quantera II, Japan). The thickness of the MoS2 deposition was measured on a spectroscopic ellipsometer (Sentech
SENpro, Germany).

4.5 Electrochemical Studies
The MoS2-coated TNTAs were first cut into small pieces
and covered
with a laser-cut polyamide tape (Kapton) to accurately define the
electrodes’ surface area; then, small pieces of samples were
glued on copper plates by using a conductive double-side copper tape.
Most of the electrochemical measurements were carried out in 0.1 M
sulfuric acid solution in a three-electrode system with platinum mesh
as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) as the reference electrode.
All electrochemical measurements, including cyclic voltammetry, impedance
spectroscopy, steady-state chronoamperometry, and linear sweep voltammetry,
were carried out on Gamry Interface 1000 potentiostats at room temperature.
The measured potentials (vs Ag/AgCl) were converted to standard hydrogen
electrode (SHE) scale using the Nernst equation E(SHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.20 V.
