Poly(glycerol sebacate)
(PGS), produced from renewable monomers
such as sebacic acid and glycerol, has been explored extensively for
various biomedical applications. However, relatively less attention
has been paid to explore PGS as sustainable materials in applications
such as elastomers and rigid plastics, primarily because of serious
deficiencies in physical properties of PGS. Here, we present two new
approaches for enhancing the properties of PGS; (i) synthesizing block
copolymers of PGS with poly(tetramethylene oxide)glycol (PTMO) and
(ii) preparing a blend of PGS-b-PTMO with a poly(ester–ether)
thermoplastic elastomer. The consequence of molar ratio (hard and
soft segments) and Mn of soft segment
on tensile properties of the material was investigated. The PGS-b-PTMO with 25:75 mole ratios of hard and soft segments
and having a medium Mn soft segment (5350
g mol–1) exhibits an appreciable increase in percentage
of elongation that is from 32% for PGS to 737%. Blends of PGS-b-PTMO and a thermoplastic polyester elastomer, Hytrel 3078,
form a semi-interpenetrated polymer network, which exhibits increased
tensile strength to 2.11 MPa and percentage of elongation to 2574.
An elongation of such magnitude is unprecedented in the literature
for predominantly aliphatic polyesters and demonstrates that the simple
polyester can be tailored for superior performance.

==== Body
Introduction
An elastomer is a material
that exhibits a rapid and reversible
strain in response to a stress.1,2 Elastomeric materials
can be classified as (a) thermoset elastomers (e.g., chemically cross-linked
natural and synthetic elastomers) and (b) thermoplastic elastomers
(TPEs; e.g., polyurethane, polyester–polyether copolymers,
dynamically cross-linked PP-EPDM blends, etc.).3 TPEs are a class of polymers that behave similar to a thermoset
rubber at below their melting or softening temperatures. Therefore,
they are melt processable via thermoplastic processing methods. Unlike
thermoset rubbers, TPEs can be easily reprocessed and remolded. The
ability to process these materials with thermoplastic methods allows
for the design and fabrication freedom that thermoset rubbers do not
offer.4 TPEs derived from polyester–polyether
(TPE-E) are an important subclass of TPEs that have been widely studied
and are in commercial use.3 TPE-Es consist
of a hard crystalline segment [poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT)]
and a soft amorphous segment [poly(tetramethylene oxide)glycol (PTMO)].
Crystalline PBT segment endows TPE-E with high Tm, high strength, as well as chemical, wear, tear, heat and
UV resistance.1 The amorphous polyether
provides softness, elasticity, flexibility, resilience, and hydrolysis
resistance. TPE-Es exhibit excellent abrasion resistance; high tensile,
compressive, and tear strength; good flexibility over a wide range
of temperatures; worthy hydrolytic stability; resistance to solvents;
and fungus attack. Depending on hard and soft segment compositions,
materials with a wide range of hardness can be produced.1,3,4

Recently, there has been
many studies aimed at creating more sustainable
elastomeric materials derived from aliphatic polyesters using renewable
bio-derived monomers and capable of degradation under hydrolytic conditions.
Several well-defined block copolymers derived from monomers such as
(+) lactide, ε-caprolactone, alkyl-substituted ε-caprolactone,
and so forth have been reported with useful elastomeric properties.5−7 Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) is a tough polyester elastomer with
good flexibility (similar to vulcanized rubber) and has the attributes
of biocompatibility and biodegradability.8−12 Most importantly, the monomer used for the preparation
of PGS, namely, glycerol and sebacic acid (SA), is bio-derived and
renewable. They are available from natural fat splitting operations
or byproduct of bio-diesel manufacturing (glycerol) and castor oil
(SA). Thus, there is an increasing interest in developing useful products
derived from PGS for a variety of sustainable elastomeric applications.
PGS belongs to the family of aliphatic polyesters, which are currently
attracting renewed attention because of the fact that they can be
often derived from bio-renewable resources, and the resulting polymers
can be degraded under composting conditions by a hydrolytic mechanism.
Several recent reviews provide a comprehensive overview of the promise
and challenge of creating a sustainable material platform based on
aliphatic polyester to meet the diverse application needs of the society.6,7,13−15

PGS forms
a covalently cross-linked, three-dimensional network
of random coils with hydroxyl groups attached to the backbone. Cross-linking
and hydrogen bonding interactions are responsible for the useful properties
of this elastomer. PGS-based elastomers have been widely explored
in biomedical applications, such as, hard to soft tissue engineering,
controlled drug delivery, and tissue adhesives.16,17 Mechanical properties of PGS can be modulated using the following
parameters: (a) curing temperature [Young’s modulus (E) of 0.056, 0.22, and 1.2 MPa were observed at curing temperatures
of 110, 120, and 130 °C, respectively],18−20 (b) molar ratio
of glycerol to SA [increasing glycerol molar ratio is seen to decrease
the tangent modulus (slope of stress–strain curve) and vice
versa],20 (c) curing time (tangent modulus
increases with the increasing curing time),20 (d) integrating acrylate monomers (e.g., E of photocured
PGS is 0.05–1.38 MPa with respect to the degree of acrylation
of 0.17–0.54),21,22 (e) incorporating nanofillers
(E is improved to 1.58 MPa with the addition of 20%
halloysite),23 (f) block polymers (E of PGS-co-poly(ethylene glycol) can be
varied from 13 kPa to 2.2 MPa),24 and (g)
blending with polymers (PGS)/poly(butylene succinate-linoleate) showed
an increase of elastic modulus from 1.2 to 54 MPa.25

The focus of studies reported thus far has been predominantly
on
PGS materials suitable for biomedical applications and possesses a
wide range of tensile strength (0.3–100 MPa) and poor elongation
properties (10–120%). In most cases, the increased E reduces the softness of materials (increases the rigidity)
and makes it unsuitable for a number of skin-contacting elastomer
applications (gloves, condoms, catheters, food wrappers, etc.). Thus,
there is a need to explore new strategies for improving the properties
of PGS-based polymers for their use in a wider range of applications.

In this article, we have explored two approaches to improve the
mechanical properties of PGS. The first one is the preparation of
block copolyester of PGS with a polyether, such as, PTMO constituting
the soft block. The second approach is to blend PGS-b-PTMO with the readily available thermoplastic polyether–polyester
elastomers consisting of a hard-crystalline segment composed of PBT
and a soft-amorphous segment composed of PTMO. To the best of our
knowledge, such an approach has not been examined so far in the earlier
literature.26,27

Results and Discussion
Preparation
of Cross-linked Thin Films of PGS (1)
PGS was
prepared from a 1:1 molar mixture of SA and glycerol
using 0.5 wt % of FASCAT 9100 as a catalyst at 135 °C. The polymer
was cross-linked using 4,4′-methylene bis(phenyl isocyanate)
(MDI). The polymer before cross-linking had an Mn of 2320 g mol–1 and a polydispersity value
of ∼10. The structure of the cross-linked polymer was established
using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Figure S1). FT-IR provides evidence for the ester
bond formation, presence of the hydroxyl groups, and absence of the
isocyanate band (2270 cm–1). In addition, the appearance
of the −NH stretching at 3485 cm–1 in the
cross-linked polymers provides evidence for the formation of urethane
linkages.

Cross-linked PGS samples exhibit a broad sigmoidal
melting peak (Tm) at −10 to −15
°C and a glass transition at −27 °C (Figures S2 and S3). These observations are in
agreement with the data reported in the literature.19 The rubbery and amorphous nature of the cross-linked PGS
is evident from its low Tg and weak Tm. Cross-linked PGS is an elastic soft solid
at room temperature. The stress–strain analysis of PGS cross-linked
with 2 wt % MDI exhibits a maximum tensile strength of 1.29 ±
0.02 MPa and an elongation at a break of 32% (Figure S4 and Table S1).

Synthesis
of Cross-linked PGS-b-PTMO (3)
With an objective to improve the mechanical properties
of PGS, we prepared block copolyesters of PGS with PTMO. The relative
mole ratio of soft and hard segments is likely to play an important
role in determining the ultimate mechanical properties.28−30 Accordingly, three different block copolymer samples were prepared
using a three-step process: in step 1, a polyester was prepared by
reacting SA (1 mmol) and PTMO (Mn: 250,
0.65, 0.75, and 0.85 mmol) using 0.5 wt % of FASCAT 9100 as a catalyst
at 150 °C at a pressure of 400 mbar [poly(tetramethylene glycol
sebacate) (SA-co-PTMO) is shown in Scheme 1]. In step 2, glycerol (0.35,
0.25, and 0.15 mmol) was reacted with the polymer obtained in step
1 at 135 °C for 8 h in vacuo (PGS-b-PTMO, 1
to 3). In step 3, the product obtained from step 2 was cross-linked
with MDI. The reactions are illustrated in Scheme 1. Here, the soft segments of PTMO are colored
red, and the PGS hard segment is colored blue.

Scheme 1 Preparation of PGS-b-PTMO Using SA, PTMO, and Glycerol
as Monomers
The 1H
NMR of the polymer obtained after step 2 is shown
in Figure 1a. The three
peaks at δ 1.30 and 1.61 ppm are assigned to the methylene protons
of SA, and the peak at δ 4.12 ppm is due to the methylene protons
on glycerol. The peak at δ 3.45 ppm corresponds to the methylene
protons of PTMO. The signals at δ 2.3 and 2.4 ppm are assigned
to ester (−CH2–COO−) and acid (−CH2–COOH) groups, indicating the conversion of acid into
ester. GPC data of the polymers obtained after step 2 are shown in Table 1.

b Represents the Mn of the soft segments produced from SA and PTMO.

Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) of PGS-b-PTMO-1 to 3 is shown in Figure 1b,c. The Tg and Tm of PTMO are −54
and ∼−39
°C, respectively, whereas the Tg and Tm of PGS are −30 and −10
°C, respectively.31 The polyester
produced from SA and PTMO (SA-co-PTMO) shows a Tm at −1.0 °C and no discernible Tg (Figure S5). This
indicates that this polyester is weakly crystalline. However, the
obtained block copolyester samples (PGS-b-PTMO-1
to 3) exhibit relatively a low Tg at −60
°C (Figures S8 and S9) and a Tm in the range of 2–9 °C (Figure 1b,c). This indicates
that both of the segments (i.e., PGS and SA-co-PTMO)
are completely miscible, and the flexibility of copolyesters is increased
significantly. Miscibility of both of the segments may be because
of the chemical similarity of succinic acid segment monomers in both
of the blocks, whereas the improvement in chain flexibility of block
copolymers could be ascribed to the presence of a flexible PTMO segment.

PGS-b-PTMO-1 to 3 exhibit nonlinear stress–strain
behavior (Figure 1d)
typical of elastomers. Polymer films produced from 1:0.75:0.25 monomer
ratios [SA, PTMO, and PGS (PGS-b-PTMO-2)] display
higher tensile strength (0.57 MPa) and percentage of elongation (287).
The block copolyesters show a ninefold increment in the percentage
of elongation compared to cross-linked PGS alone (Table 1). However, this is accompanied
by a reduction in tensile strength. As noted above, the block copolyester,
PGS-b-PTMO-2, with a 75:25 mole ratio of PTMO and
PGS exhibits better elastic properties. With a view to investigate
the effect of Mn of soft segment on stress–strain
properties, copolyester samples with soft segment Mn of (Mn 2640, 5350, and 7960
g mol–1) were prepared by the reaction of SA (1
mmol) and PTMO (0.85, 0.95, and 1 mmol) at 400 mbar pressure and 150
°C for 12 h (step 1). In step 2, SA (0.14, 0.25, and 0.33 mmol)
and glycerol (0.29, 0.30, and 0.33 mmol) were added to realize an
overall mole ratio of soft and hard segments of 75:25, and the reaction
was performed at 135 °C for 8 h under 400 mbar pressure. In step
3, the sample obtained from step 2 was dissolved in chloroform, reacted
with MDI (2 wt % of hard segments), and the films were cast from the
solution. Subsequently, the cast film was cross-linked at 170 °C
for 6–7 h under 5 mbar pressures to obtain thin elastic films.

The DSC data of the PGS-b-PTMO-4 to 6 are shown
in Figures 1b,c, S8,
and S9 and Table 1.
These block copolyesters (PGS-b-PTMO-4 to 6) also
exhibit a discernible Tg at −60
°C (Figures S8 and S9) and a Tm in the range of 6–13 °C (Figure 1b,c). This indicates
that these materials are rubbery in nature. Among the block copolymers
studied, PGS-b-PTMO-6 sample shows a higher and broad Tm at 13.2 °C. This suggests that the higher Mn (7960 g mol–1) of the soft
segment (SA-co-PTMO) may have limited miscibility
in the PGS phase.

PGS-b-PTMO-5 produced from
the 1.25:0.95:0.30
monomer ratio of SA, PTMO, and glycerol and cross-linked with MDI
shows better tensile strength (0.76 MPa) and percentage of elongation
(737) (Table 1 and Figure 1d). Increasing the Mn of soft segment to 5350 g mol–1 resulted in an increase of percentage of elongation to 737. For
reasons not well-understood, further increase in Mn of the soft segment resulted in loss of elongation.
Thus, the elastic property of PGS could be improved by substantially
using a simple approach of forming a block copolymer of PGS with PTMO.
PTMO is produced from the ring-opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran
(THF), which could also be considered as a bio-derived monomer because
THF can be produced from bio-derived succinic acid. Thus, the copolymer
PGS-b-PTMO can be considered as an elastomer that
is entirely derived bio-resources and hydrolytically degradable, two
key attributes of sustainability.

Semi-Interpenetrating Polymer
Networks Derived from Copolyesters
PGS-b-PTMO-5 and Hytrel 3078
Interpenetrating
polymer networks (IPNs) refer to a blend of cross-linked polymers
in which two chemically distinct macromolecular networks coexist,
ideally having a structure, that is, homogeneous down to the molecular
level.26,32,33 IPNs are classified
as semi and full IPNs, depending on whether one or both of the two
components are cross-linked. IPNs are prepared by three general routes:
(i) by mixing two monomers, which are subsequently (and often simultaneously)
polymerized and cross-linked, (ii) by dissolving a monomer in an another
polymer network followed by its polymerization to form the second
interpenetrating network, and (iii) by blending two polymers that
are thermodynamically miscible, followed by cross-linking.34,35

We have prepared a semi-IPN (S-IPN) of PGS-b-PTMO with commercially available thermoplastic polyester, Hytrel
3078, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), DSC and universal
testing machine. Several grades of thermoplastic polyester polyether
elastomers (TPE-Es) are commercially available and exhibit a wide
balance of flexibility/stiffness properties.36,37 Therefore, there is a huge potential to prepare elastomers with
a wide range of physical and mechanical properties.

We anticipated
good compatibility between two chosen polymers on
account of the presence of segments of PTMO blocks in both of the
constituent polymers. Accordingly, blends of PGS-b-PTMO-5 (prepared from 1.14:0.95:0.29 ratio of SA, PTMO, and glycerol)
and Hytrel 3078 (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 wt %) with and without MDI
(2 wt % of MDI with respect to glycerol) were prepared by solution
blending. The resulting thin films were transparent and elastic (Figure 6). When one of the
constituent polymers, namely PGS-b-PTMO-5, is cross-linked
using MDI, a semi-interpenetrating structure will be resulted, in
which the Hytrel 3078 will interpenetrate into the cross-linked chain
segments of PGS-b-PTMO-5.

Microstructural Characterization
of S-IPNs
The XRD
of the blend, with and without MDI, is shown in Figure 2a,b. The XRD patterns of neat Hytrel 3078
showed five characteristic peaks centered at a d-spacing
of 5.45 Å (2θ = 16.23), 5.06 Å (2θ = 17.48),
4.29 Å (2θ = 20.66), 3.78 Å (2θ = 23.48), and
3.51 Å (2θ = 25.34), which can be attributed to the 011,
010, 101, 100, and 111 reflections of Hytrel unit cell, respectively.38 The observed diffraction patterns represent
PBT (attributed to the crystalline structure of the hard polyester
block of Hytrel 3078), whereas the strong scattering background is
due to the amorphous polyether (PTMO) block of Hytrel 3078. On the
contrary, PGS-b-PTMO-5 exhibits a broad halo peak
centered at a d-spacing of 4.42 Å (20.04), which
is characteristic of an amorphous polymer.

Figure 2 Wide-angle XRD patterns
of PGS-b-PTMO-5, Hytrel
3078, and the blends (a) without cross-linker and (b) and with cross-linker.

When the content of Hytrel 3078
was low, that is, 10 and 20 wt
%, the blends show only a broad amorphous peak similar to PGS-b-PTMO-5. However, with higher amounts of Hytrel 3078 (30
and 40 wt %), the blends show that Hytrel’s five characteristic
peaks are superimposed with PGS-b-PTMO-5’s
broad peak. At 50 wt % of Hytrel, the blend displays small humps of
Hytrel’s representative peaks. All of these results indicate
that the crystalline regions of the Hytrel (because of PBT) may be
affected by the presence of PGS-b-PTMO-5 and could
form an S-IPN. XRD patterns are observed to be similar for both the
non-cross-linked and cross-linked blends.

Tm and Tg of the blend samples
are shown in Figure 3 and Table S2.
All samples show a single Tg (between
63.6 and −72.3 °C) indicating the rubbery nature of the
produced materials. Hytrel 3078 shows Tg at −65.3 °C with two broad Tms at 4.1 and 164 °C (Tc = −30
and 100 °C, respectively) (Figure S10). The broad melting peaks are due to the polydispersed lamellar
thickness (crystalline) of the hard segments (PBT). The supplier’s
(DuPont) data sheet provides the value of Tg of −60 °C and Tm of 177
°C. PGS-b-PTMO-5 displays a sharp Tm at 11.1 °C (Tc = −17.6
°C). Nearly, monodispersed crystalline regions of PGS may be
the reason for a sharp melting peak.

Figure 3 DSC thermogram of heating and cooling
cycles of the blends (a,b)
without a cross-linker (i.e., MDI) and (c,d) with a cross-linker (i.e.,
MDI).

When Hytrel 3078 is blended with
PGS-b-PTMO-5,
two broad melting peaks at 4.1 and 164 °C corresponding to Hytrel
3078 disappeared and a new sharp Tm is
observed between 3.1 and 6.6 °C. This is because of the formation
of S-IPN, which does not allow the Hytrel’s hard segment to
crystallize; therefore, the two Tms vanished
and supported the XRD findings. Increasing the percentage of Hytrel
(10–40 wt %) caused Tm to decrease
from 6.6 to 3.1 °C. Upon further increase in the Hytrel 3078
content to 50 wt %, Tm showed a small
increase to 4.4 °C. Tc is decreased
from −18.9 to −33.6 °C (near the Hytrel’s
broad Tc at −30 °C) with an
increasing Hytrel 3078 from 10 to 50 wt %. In addition, broadening
of the crystallization peak was observed. This indicates that the
increased amount of Hytrel in the blend system affects the crystallization
behavior of PGS-b-PTMO-5; therefore, a clear downward
shifting and broadening of Tc are observed.
The blend samples with MDI also showed a similar melting and crystallization
behavior (Tm and Tc between 2.2–4.7 and −19.7 to −36.8 °C,
respectively).

These observations suggest that the blends of
Hytrel 3078 with
PGS-b-PTMO-5 are miscible at a molecular level. The
ability of the hard segment in Hytrel 3078 to crystallize is inhibited
by the presence of PGS-b-PTMO segments. Interestingly,
the presence of Hytrel 3078 in the blend does not inhibit the weak
crystallization tendency of PGS-b-PTMO. However,
the increasing amount of Hytrel wt % inhibits the crystallization
of PGS-b-PTMO. Therefore, the shifting of Tm is observed toward Hytrel’s Tm when the amount of Hytrel is increased in
the blend system.

The thin film of the blend, with and without
MDI, was subjected
to stress–strain analysis, and the results are shown as Figure 4a,b and Table S2. For comparison, the stress–strain
properties of Hytrel 3078 were also measured using thin-film specimens
of the same dimensions and processing conditions as used for the blends
(i.e., PGS-b-PTMO-H-1 to 6). The obtained tensile
strength (0.44 MPa) and percentage of elongation (342) for Hytrel
3078 were lower than what are reported using specimens of ASTM dimensions.
The difference in properties could be because of differing dimensions
of the specimens and the processing conditions.

the blend samples prepared (a) without a
cross-linker (i.e., MDI) and (b) with a cross-linker (i.e., MDI).

(d) sol content (without and with MDI) in which wt % of leached PGS-b-PTMO-5 and Hytrel from the S-IPN in CHCl3 are
also incorporated.

The blend samples, PGS-b-PTMO–Hytrel-1,
show a lower tensile strength compared to PGS-b-PTMO.
This may be because of the fact that both of the materials are miscible
and addition of 10 wt % of Hytrel disrupts the physical (H-bonding)
and chemical linkages between the chains of PGS-b-PTMO. However, PGS-b-PTMO–Hytrel 3078 (2–5)
shows an increase of tensile strength with increasing Hytrel 3078
content in the blend compared to the parent materials. On the contrary,
elongation increased significantly by the addition of Hytrel 3078,
from 737 to 2574%. The inability of the hard segment in Hytrel 3078
to crystallize by the addition of PGS-b-PTMO could
be the reason why there is little improvement in tensile strength
in the blend system (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Representation of the Formation of S-IPN between PGS-b-PTMO and Hytrel
In this instance, PGS-b-PTMO acts similar
to a
“plasticizer” to Hytrel 3078, causing a reduction in
resistance to strain because of the plasticization of the crystalline
domain. This, in turn, leads to a significant increase in elongation
far in excess of that observed individually for either Hytrel 3078
(342%) or PGS-b-PTMO-5 (737%). As anticipated, cross-linking
the PGS-b-PTMO-5 segment caused a reduction in the
percentage of elongation; however, the values were still higher than
that of the individual constituents. At the same time, the tensile
strength of cross-linked materials showed a marginal decrease in the
case of 60:40 and 50:50 blends, that is, PGS-b-PTMO-H-4-X
and PGS-b-PTMO-H-5-X (1.49 and 1.90 MPa) when compared
to the similar composition of non-cross-linked blends (PGS-b-PTMO-H-4 and PGS-b-PTMO-H-5) (1.58 and
2.11 MPa). This can be ascribed to the cross-linking of PGS-b-PTMO with MDI, which reduces the elastic nature of the
material and could inhibit the strain-induced crystallization of the
hard segments of Hytrel. In contrast, non-cross-linked blends (i.e.,
without MDI) form a more flexible network, which could allow the strain-induced
crystallization of the hard segments of Hytrel.

Swelling Behavior
and Sol Content of the Blends
The
swelling ratio and the sol content of the blend samples (PGS-b-PTMO–Hytrel 3078) were determined (Figure 4c,d). The swelling ratio is
observed to be constant up to 30 wt % of Hytrel 3078 content in the
blend. Further increase in the Hytrel 3078 content to 40% almost doubles
the swelling ratio. The blend prepared with 50 wt % Hytrel 3078 was
brittle and could not be recovered as a whole. The high solubility
of Hytrel 3078 in chloroform could be the reason for this observation.
The cross-linked blends with MDI show significantly lower propensity
for swelling compared to non-cross-linked samples; however, a steady
increase is observed with the content of Hytrel 3078 in the blend.
This is due to the increased cross-linking density.

PGS-b-PTMO and cross-linked PGS-b-PTMO samples
show a lower sol content, that is, 12 and 8 wt %, respectively, compared
to the corresponding blends with Hytrel 3078. The sol content (wt
%) is observed to be increased with the increasing wt % of Hytrel
3078. When the wt % of Hytrel 3078 is 10, PGS-b-PTMO-H-1
(without MDI) shows 20 wt % sol content, whereas PGS-b-PTMO-H-1-X (with MDI) has a sol content similar to PGS-b-PTMO-X. Increasing the amount of Hytrel 3078 to 20 wt % (PGS-b-PTMO-H-2) did not cause the sol content to increase; however,
30 and 40 wt % of Hytrel 3078-containing materials (PGS-b-PTMO-H-3 and PGS-b-PTMO-H-4) show a higher sol
content that is 28 and 35 wt %, respectively. The sample containing
50 wt % of Hytrel 3078 (PGS-b-PTMO-H-5) became brittle
upon immersion in chloroform and not possible to calculate the sol
content. With cross-linked materials (PGS-b-PTMO-H-2-X
to 4-X), the sol content was found to increase with an increasing
content of Hytrel 3078 up to 40 wt %. In summary, cross-linked blends
show lower sol content compared to non-cross-linked blends. When MDI
is used as a cross-linker, covalent urethane linkages are formed increasing
the network density. In the absence of the added cross-linker, the
blends possess only physical cross-links (H-bonding) resulting in
a reduced network density. Thus, the swelling ratio and the sol content
are observed to be higher.

The 1H NMR spectrum of
Hytrel 3078 is shown in Figure S11. By
comparing the intensity of aromatic 1H (8.1 ppm) and CH2 protons sitting next to −O–
group in PTMO (3.4 ppm), the Mn of PTMO
was calculated as 1100 g mol–1. From the ratio of
signals corresponding to CH2 protons sitting next to −COO–
[4.4 and 4.3 ppm corresponds to PTMO and butane diol (BD), respectively],
the ratio of PTMO and BD phase was calculated to be 72 and 28 mol
%, respectively. Correspondingly, the wt % of terephthalic acid (TA)
group in Hytrel is calculated as 30.4.

The 1H NMR
analysis of the sol content of the blend
samples is given in Figure S12. In Hytrel,
wt % of TA is 30.4, whereas in PGS–PTMO, wt % of SA is 49.6.
As we know, the aromatic protons (from Hytrel) are observed at 8.1
ppm, whereas −CH2–COO– (represents
PGS-b-PTMO-5) is seen at 2.2 ppm. In an ideal 50:50
wt % mixture of both might show the intensity 0.34 (TA) and 0.496
(SA). By integrating both of the peaks and dividing by 0.34 and 0.496,
respectively, the wt % of Hytrel and PGS-PTMO-5 was calculated and
incorporated in Figure 4d.

1H NMR spectra of the sol contents indicate that
only
oligomers (of PGS-b-PTMO-5) and Hytrel 3078 leach
out from the thin film material (while at CHCl3) in both
cases, that is, with and without MDI. In this case, blend samples
prepared without MDI show that by increasing the wt % of Hytrel from
10 to 20 and 30% has decreased the Hytrel 3078 leaching from 28 to
15 wt %. Further increasing the Hytrel 3078 wt % to 40 in the blend
has made a small increment in the wt % of Hytrel 3078 leaching to
18. This material shows the highest percentage of elongation, that
is, 2574. 1H NMR of sol content of the samples prepared
with MDI is also given in Figure S12. Here,
in contrast, increasing the wt % of Hytrel 3078 (in the blend) from
10 to 20 and 30 has increased the wt % of Hytrel leaching from 12
to 20. Further increasing the wt % of Hytrel to 40 and 50 has significantly
increased the leaching Hytrel 3078 wt % to 35. This suggests that
cross-linking with MDI possibly increases the phase separation between
Hytrel 3078 and PGS-b-PTMO. However, in the blend
prepared without MDI, the miscibility between Hytrel 3078 and PGS-b-PTMO is enhanced leading to the observed higher percentage
of elongation.

Conclusions
PGS is a class of cross-linkable
aliphatic polyesters derived from
biorenewable monomers, namely, glycerol and SA. Cross-linked PGS show
poor tensile strength and elongation properties. We demonstrate herein
that incorporating a soft segment in PGS, namely PTMO (75 mol %),
results in an amorphous block copolymer, which exhibits a significant
increase in elongation, from 32% for PGS to 730% for PGS-b-PTMO. The fact that PTMO can also be derived from biorenewable resources
makes such a polyester-b-polyether a sustainable
elastic material. We have further demonstrated that the blending of
PGS-b-PTMO with a thermoplastic poly(ester–ether)
elastomer (Hytrel 3078) can lead to a semi-interpenetrating network
polymer, exhibiting further improvements in both tensile strength
and elongation. Using appropriate composition of materials, an elongation
of up to 2500% was obtained. To the best of our knowledge, such high
elongation properties have never been observed for predominantly aliphatic
polyesters. A summary of properties of materials reported in this
article with a few similar materials available in the literature are
given in Table 2 and Figure 5, which support our
contention. Furthermore, the produced films are transparent and tough.

a For s. no. 3 and 9, dog-bone-shaped
and ring samples (ASTM-3492 standards) were employed, respectively,
for measuring the tensile properties, whereas for s. no. 1 and 2,
the sample dimension details are not reported.

Using a wide variety of physicochemical
methods, we have examined
the structure of such materials. It is demonstrated that the block
copolymer of PGS and PTMO is a single-phase weakly crystalline polymer
having a single Tg. We further propose
that the PGS-b-PTMO copolyester acts as an efficient
plasticizer by inhibiting the crystallization of the hard blocks of
Hytrel 3078, resulting in a synergistic improvement in elongation
to an unprecedented level. The cross-linked blends are best understood
as semi-interpenetrating networks, wherein the PGS-b-PTMO forms a continuous network through which Hytrel 3078 chain
interpenetrate forming a miscible homogeneous blend.

We conclude
that the properties of PGS (prepared from biorenewable
and sustainable source of monomers) can be improved by both block
copolyester formation with soft segments and blend formation with
TPE-E’s to yield elastomeric materials with excellent transparency,
toughness, and elongation properties (Figure 6). Predominantly
aliphatic polyester–polyether elastomers are also biocompatible
and offer many opportunities for tailoring physical properties to
fulfil the needs of diverse applications. These materials can also
be designed with high sustainability quotient because they can be
degraded under hydrolytic conditions, unlike cross-linked hydrocarbon-derived
elastomers, which persist indefinitely in the environment.

mm demonstrate the (a,b) strength and toughness of the materials;
(c–e) film clarity, transparency, and flexibility; and (f,g)
evidence of elongation. Yellow color in the material is due to the
presence of the aromatic cross-linker (MDI).

Materials and Methods
Anhydrous glycerol (≥99%),
SA (99%), PTMO (Mn ≈ 250), and
MDI (98%) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further purification. FASCAT 9100 (mono-n-butyl tin oxide or butylstannoic acid), which is used as catalyst,
was purchased from PMC Organometallix, Beijing, China. The thermoplastic
polyester elastomer chosen for this study was Hytrel 3078 and was
obtained from DuPont.

Synthesis of Cross-linked PGS (1)
An equimolar
amount of glycerol and SA was melted and stirred for 2 h in a 250
mL two-necked round-bottom flask under nitrogen atmosphere at 135
°C in the presence of 0.5 wt % FASCAT 9100 as the catalyst. The
reaction pressure was slowly reduced to 400 mbar over 4 h using (SC950
KNF lab) a vacuum pump, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for
an additional 4 h at 135 °C. A sample of prepolymer thus obtained
was set aside for the spectroscopic analysis. The remaining prepolymer
was poured into a Teflon mold and cross-linked in a vacuum oven at
170 °C for 6–7 h. To investigate the effect of cross-linking
on mechanical properties of PGS, varying amounts of MDI, that is,
0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 wt %, were added to the PGS prepolymer.

Synthesis
of SA-co-PTMO (2)
The polyester
SA-co-PTMO was prepared using SA
and PTMO (Mn ≈ 250) in the molar
ratio of 1:0.65/0.75/0.85 and 0.5 wt % of FASCAT 9100 as the catalyst.
The reactants were taken in a round-bottom flask and heated in a heating
block with a magnetic stirrer. After melting, the flask was evacuated
and the pressure was reduced slowly from 1000 to 400 mbar in about
3 h, and the reaction mixture was maintained under this condition
for 8 h at 150 °C to complete the reaction.

Synthesis of
PGS-b-PTMO (3)
The polyester
PGS-b-PTMO was prepared by reacting
SA-co-PTMO and glycerol (0.35/0.25/0.15 mol) for
8 h at 135 °C. Cross-linking of the polymer was carried out using
2 wt % (with respect to glycerol) of MDI. The polyester, PGS-b-PTMO (∼10 gm), and MDI were dissolved in 50 mL
of chloroform and stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 4–5
h and then poured in a Teflon mold. The dish was kept in a fume hood
for 12 h to evaporate the solvent. The sample was cross-linked in
a vacuum oven at 170 °C under reduced vacuum (10 mbar) for 8
h.

Preparation of Blends of PGS-b-PTMO (3) with TPE and Hytrel 3078 (4)
Solution
blending of PGS-b-PTMO-5 polyester with Hytrel 3078
was carried out in three steps. In step 1, the polyester was dissolved
in chloroform (1:2 w/v), and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. In step
2, Hytrel 3078 was dissolved in chloroform (1:10 w/v), and the mixture
was stirred for 8 h at 40 °C. In step 3, 10, 20, 30, 40, and
50 wt % of Hytrel 3078 were added to PGS-b-PTMO-5,
both as solutions in chloroform and stirred for 10 h. Similar blends
were prepared with 2 wt % MDI (with respect to the PGS-b-PTMO). The solutions were poured into a Teflon dish (15 × 12
cm) and kept in a fume hood for chloroform evaporation. Then, these
samples were cross-linked at 170 °C at 10 mbar pressure for 8
h to obtain elastic thin films.

Characterization
The IR spectra of the samples were
recorded on a Perkin Elmer FT-IR spectrophotometer using attenuated
total reflection technique. The molecular weight was analyzed using
gel permeation chromatography (PL-GPC-220, Agilent). THF was used
as an eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min–1. The
temperature of the columns and the refractive index detector was 40
°C. The columns were calibrated using monodisperse polystyrenes
(1000–100 000 g mol–1).

Wide-angle
XRD measurements were performed on XEUSS SAXS/WAXS system using a
GeniX microsource from Xenocs at 50 kV and 0.6 mA. The Cu Kα
radiation (1.54 Å) was collimated with FOX2D mirror and two pairs
of scatterless slits from Xenocs. The 2D patterns were documented
on a mar345 image plate and processed using Fit2D software. All of
the measurements were carried out in the transmission mode.

DSC measurements were made on NETZSCH 204F1 Phoenix DSC instrument.
Samples of 10–20 mg were used for DSC measurements. PGS samples
were first heated to 150 °C from room temperature at a rate of
10 °C/min. Subsequently, the samples were cooled at a rate of
10 °C/min to −50 °C (whereas SA-co-PTMO and PGS-b-PTMO samples were cooled to −150
°C). Hytrel 3078 and the blend samples were first heated to 200
°C from room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/min and cooled
to −100 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. For the polymers,
the first cooling and second heating scan were used to determine the
melting and crystallization peaks. The peak maximum or minimum was
taken as the melting or crystallization temperature, respectively.
The peak area was used to calculate the enthalpy.

Mechanical
Properties
Stress–strain properties
were measured using a Shimadzu AGX-10 universal testing machine at
a cross-head speed of 50 mm/min and a load cell of 50 kN. The uniaxial
tensile testing was performed by cutting the thermally cross-linked
samples in a rectangular shape with 10 mm gauge length, 5 mm width,
and ∼0.75–1.5 mm thickness.

Sol Content and Swelling
Studies
The degree of cross-linking
was determined by sol (non-cross-linked network) and gel (cross-linked
network) content analysis. The cross-linked samples (10 mm diameter
and 2 mm thick) were immersed in chloroform for 24 h (swollen weight Ws). The swollen sample was dried in vacuo at
40 °C for 24 h, and the final weight (Wd) was recorded. Percent sol content (sol %) was calculated
from Wi and Wd, whereas the degree of swelling was obtained as Ws and Wd using the following
two equations, respectively 1   2
