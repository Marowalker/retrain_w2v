The
laser crystallization (LC) of amorphous silicon thin films
into polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si) thin films on glass substrates
is an active field of research in the fabrication of Si-based thin
film transistors and thin film solar cells. Efforts have been, in
particular, focused on the improvement of LC technique. Adhesion promoters
of the crystallized Si thin films at the glass interface play a crucial
role in the stability and device performance of fabricated structures.
The crystalline Si thin films are required to be produced free of
contamination risks arising from impurity diffusion from the glass
substrate. Moreover, it is preferable to fabricate pc-Si thin films
at temperatures as close as possible to the ambient temperature for
an effective cost reduction. In this work, we demonstrate the successful
use of a commercially available nanosecond pulsed laser marker at
1064 nm wavelength for Si crystallization at ambient conditions compared
to the common method of pre-elevated substrate temperatures used in
continuous wave laser irradiation technique. As a result, our technique
results in a better energy balance than that in previous works. The
second main purpose of this study is to enhance the crystallinity
of Si thin films and to determine the best choice of an intermediate
dielectric layer (IDL) comparatively among four thin buffer layers,
namely, SiNx, SiO2, ZnO, and
TiO2, for the sake of obtaining improved adhesion and larger
crystalline domains as compared to that on a direct Si–glass
interface. The crystalline qualities of samples containing IDLs of
SiNx, SiO2, ZnO, and TiO2 were compared via Raman spectroscopy analysis and electron
backscatter diffraction method against the direct Si–glass
interface reference. The analyses quantitatively showed that both
the crystallinity and the domain sizes can be increased via IDLs.

Introduction
Obtaining polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si)
thin films via in situ
annealing of amorphous silicon (a-Si) films on various carrier substrates
is attractive for electronics industry, especially for Si-based thin
film transistors and solar cell applications.1,2 Particularly,
cost-effective glass substrates are the most prevalent materials for
the crystallization of a-Si. The traditional way of producing pc-Si
thin films is the solid-phase crystallization (SPC) method. However,
SPC method has drawbacks of long annealing durations (∼24 h)
and small grain size (∼1–3 μm), which result in
high defect concentrations.3,4 Rapid thermal annealing
(RTA) is also a SPC method in which typically a halogen lamp is used
to heat and crystallize a-Si thin films over glass substrates.5 The RTA process starts with a steep heating ramp
(∼200 °C/s), which is followed by a steady temperature
phase of ∼900 °C and finalizes with a cooling down (∼80
°C/s) phase, all maintained under an appropriate gas ambient.5 During these stages of the process, deformations
occur on the glass substrates, which limits the choice of substrate
materials.5 Aluminum-induced crystallization
(AIC) of a-Si is another crystallization method that is carried out
at relatively lower temperatures (<500 °C), and grain sizes
(>10 μm) achieved using this method makes AIC pc-Si films
suitable
as seed layers for further crystallization techniques.6 Besides, the use of different intermediate dielectric
layers (IDLs; such as SiNx, SiO2, ZnO, and TiO2) can change the pc-Si film properties
such as grain orientation and grain size.6,7 The
subsequent epitaxial growth on AIC seed layers was studied extensively.8,9 However, although resulting in large grains, the high density of
intragrain defects makes this method inconvenient for solar cell applications.10,11 The liquid-phase crystallization (LPC) is an alternative way of
producing pc-Si films. A deposited thin a-Si layer on glass is locally
melt by a focused energy source such that the rapid off-switching
of the energy inflow results in a quick solidification after which
a-Si ends up as pc-Si. LPC by electron beam (e-beam) crystallization
of Si is used to produce pc-Si layers up to 10 μm in thickness
on glass substrates.12−15 Furthermore, LPC was improved by using a line-shaped e-beam source.15 In previous studies, it was shown that LPC method
resulted in more efficient thin film pc-Si solar cells.13−17

In addition to e-beam crystallization method, laser crystallization
(LC) is another method for use in LPC.5,13,15,16,18−22 Especially, by using a continuous wave (CW) laser in LPC, crystalline
domain size in the range of millimeters in width and up to centimeters
in length on glass substrates was achieved.13,20,22 Moreover, the defects and deformations of
the substrates can be avoided or lowered and the choice of substrates
and IDLs (buffer layers) can be diversified.12,16,19,21,23,24 The LC method for crystallization
of a-Si thin films was studied with CW diode lasers with a line-focus in
which the axis of the line-focus was perpendicular to scan directions.24,25 Most of the past work was carried out using CW infrared (IR) lasers,
and a-Si films on glass substrates were kept at elevated temperatures
during the laser annealing process because at room temperature the
a-Si layers exhibit low absorption of the infrared irradiation in
comparison to the visible.5,24 To increase the light
absorption, the samples were kept at temperatures in the range of
400–700 °C.5,12−14,16,18 Besides the absorption
enhancement, the thermal expansion coefficient of the glass substrates
approaches to that of crystalline silicon (c-Si) at around 600 °C.22 Additionally, the elevated substrate temperature
can be used to avoid the crack formation through crystalline domains
during the LC process and it can reduce thermally induced stress on
the pc-Si layers.5,16,22,24

Importance of an IDL between the glass
substrate and the pc-Si
thin film is attributed to its features such as blocking the diffusion
of contaminants from the substrate into the pc-Si film during thermal
processes and preventing lattice or average interatomic distance mismatch
between the substrate and the film.6,15,16,19 For LPC, c-Si/SiO2 nanocrystalline interface with an undefined stoichiometry
was observed.26 LPC process by e-beam with
an interface of SiO2 was found to be suitable as an IDL
between the glass substrate and the silicon thin film, which improved
the homogeneity of the thickness of the crystallized absorber.26 Besides using SiO2 as an IDL, SiNx can be an alternative. The amount of Si content
in SiNx layers can change the crystallization
properties of the a-Si films; moreover, the quality of pc-Si films
can be improved by a SiNx IDL. For example,
such a layer can be deposited by decreasing the NH4/SiH4 ratio, that is, increasing silicon in the content of the
SiNx IDL6 in
a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system. It was
also shown that SiNx IDLs with a higher
Si content helped in the improvement of the crystallinity of Si thin
films more than that of the samples with IDLs of Al/ZnO (AZO).6 In the study of Dore et al.,13 SiCx was shown to act as a
better wetting layer than SiO2 or SiNx. Besides that, there was no correlation between laser fluence
and crystallinity of the pc-Si layer.13 It was shown that SiO2 IDL provided larger crystal grains
of Si induced by the laser irradiation than that of SiNx because the thermal conductivity of SiO2 is lower than that of the glass substrate.27,28 Thus, the best heat flow decreases from the Si film; on the contrary,
the SiNx layer has a higher thermal conductivity
than that of SiO2, which makes the Si film lose the heat
during the laser-induced LPC.27,28

In this work,
LPC of a-Si was performed by a 1064 nm nanosecond
pulsed laser with different types of IDLs in between e-beam-deposited
a-Si and a glass substrate. While LC processing of a-Si films, the
effects of the varied IDLs were investigated quantitatively by Raman
spectroscopy and qualitatively by electron backscatter diffraction
(EBSD) and scanning electron microscopy. Compared to CW lasers, the
pulsed laser enabled the process to increase the energy efficiency
of the fabrication of a-Si thin films on glass by nullifying the cost
of extra preheating of the substrates up to a temperature of 700 °C.
It was shown that a commercially available 1064 nm nanosecond laser
marker, which was originally not tailored for this specific purpose,
can actually be a convenient tool. The IDLs of SiNx, SiO2, ZnO, and TiO2, deposited on
glass substrates separately, were investigated and compared with each
other as well as a reference sample without an IDL in relation to
the crystallinity quality of the Si thin films in the aspects of Raman
and EBSD analyses.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Thin Films
In all of the experiments,
Schott AF 32 Eco glass with a thickness of 1.1 mm was used as a substrate.
The glass were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone, isopropanol,
and distilled water for 10 min in each step. Finally, the glass were
dipped into 10% hydrofluoric acid solution for 15 s and then cleaned
with distilled water. Four different IDLs, SiNx, SiO2, ZnO, and TiO2, were deposited
before a-Si deposition. SiNx deposition
was carried out by a PECVD system (Vaksis Guner), in which decomposition
of ammonia (NH3) and silane (SiH4) precursor
gases with a ratio of 1:2 NH3/SiH4 was used.
We would like to note that all of the used PECVD deposition gases
(Linde and Air Liquide) were of 99.999% purity. The gas pressure was
kept at 1.3 × 102 Pa, and the substrate temperature
(Ts) was kept at 200 °C. The final
thickness of SiNx was 30 nm. SiO2 was deposited by reactive sputtering technique (Vaksis NanoD) with
a fused silica target (99.995% purity, Kurt-Lesker). The gas pressure
was kept at 0.53 Pa, and the ratio of Ar to O2 was kept
at 30. The substrate was not heated during the film deposition. The
final thickness of SiO2 was 30 nm. TiO2 layers
were deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD, Vedge ALD). At the
system pressure of 30 Pa, the flow rate of the precursor N2 was 20 sccm, whereas the pressures of the precursors for O2 and Ti were 50 and 40 Pa, respectively. The substrate temperature
was 130 °C, and 550 ALD cycles were performed. The cycles proceeded
as follows: 15 ms for Ti precursor (tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium,
Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999% purity) injection, 15 s for purge, 15 ms for
O2 injection, and 15 s for purge consecutively. The final
thickness of TiO2 was 30 nm. ZnO layers were also deposited
by ALD: 15 ms Zn precursor (diethylzinc, Sigma-Aldrich, deposition
systems grade) injection, 5 s N2 purge, 15 ms H2O injection, and 15 s N2 purge consecutively. 200 ALD
cycles were performed at 200 °C, resulting in a thickness of
∼30–35 nm ZnO layer. After the buffer layer processes
were accomplished, an a-Si thin film was deposited onto each IDL.
E-beam (Vaksis EC e-Beam) evaporation was used for a-Si deposition.
For the evaporation of Si, the base pressure of the chamber was 2.66
× 10–5 Pa, and during the deposition, the pressure
was kept between 1 × 10–4 and 6.6 × 10–5 Pa. The substrate temperature was kept constant at
250 °C during the evaporation process, and e-beam current was
varied between 100 and 115 mA to keep the deposition rate constant
at 1 nm/s. The thickness of the a-Si layer was ∼600 nm for
all samples.

Laser Crystallization Procedure
In this work, a 1064
nm wavelength nanosecond pulsed laser was employed. The duration of
the pulses was measured as 200 ns via a fast Si photo detector. The
value of the pulse duration is given as the full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) value of the measured pulse in time. The pulse repetition rate
was 80 kHz. The average power of the irradiation at the surface of
the samples was 1.32–1.53 watt, and the pulse energy was 16.5–19.1
μJ. The effective laser focal spot diameter on the Si thin films
was ∼40 μm so that the peak fluence of the laser on the
thin films corresponded to a value of 2.63–3.04 J/cm2. The peak fluence was adjusted to keep the extinct energy in the
a-Si film constant according to the variations in the thicknesses
of the samples. The scan speed was set at a value of 114.4 mm/s, which
maintained the pulse-overlap ratio at a value of 97.6%. At this scan
speed, LC processing of a 1 cm2 area takes about 25 s.
The laser focus was scanned on the samples in a pattern of concentric
rings forming a continuous disk (Figure 1). In addition to the overlapping of successive
pulses, the concentric rings are also maintained to overlap with increasing
diameter.

Figure 1 LC processing of samples: (a) pulse-overlap, (b) ring-overlap,
and (c) photograph of the LC-processed pc-Si disk with a diameter
of 12 mm.

The samples were processed and
characterized in quintuplicate for
obtaining statistics as the fabrication is prone to variations due
to uncertainties in the leveling of the sample substrates, the jitter
in the laser system, and so forth. All samples were analyzed using
Raman spectroscopy to check the consistency of the laser process,
measured at a similar location on each sample, which is approximately
midway between the center and the circumference of the disk.

Results
and Discussion
Raman Spectroscopy
For the analysis
of crystallinity,
Raman spectroscopy was used with a CW solid state laser at a wavelength
of 532 nm as the excitation source. For each sample, the crystalline
Si Raman shift frequency of the phonon peak center around 521 cm–1 and FWHM value of each peak were measured via a 50
cm monochromator ICCD-based fiber-coupled Raman spectroscopy system
(Horiba-JobinYvon iHR550). A calibration was performed before each
measurement using a c-Si sample by monitoring the one-phonon peak
at 521 cm–1 with a FWHM value of ≈3.8 cm–1 to ensure consistency (see Figure 2). To minimize instrumental errors, a spectrum
of the reference c-Si sample was acquired before and after the measurements
of each sample set to check for the proper calibration. The intensities
of all Raman signals were normalized to make comparative deductions
for samples in terms of peak position and peak width easily. Having
determined the Raman peak positions and the FWHM values for the same
type of samples, the average values and variations were calculated
(see Figure 3).

Figure 2 Average Raman
spectra of the IDL sample sets.

Figure 3 Comparison of Raman peak positions and peak widths.

The Raman peak position of the sample without a
buffer layer exhibited
a red shift more than that of other samples, which indicates a higher
tensile stress than that of others. This can be attributed to the
mismatch of the thermal conductivities and the thermal expansion coefficients
of the glass substrate and laser-induced pc-Si. The corresponding
crystalline grain sizes are given in Table 1. The narrowed Raman peaks for the ZnO and
TiO2 samples point out larger single crystal domain sizes
and hence a better crystallinity in the processed regions than that
of the other samples. In Figure 3, it can be seen from the Raman peak positions that
the average tensile stress decreases gradually for the samples with
SiO2, ZnO, and TiO2 IDLs, respectively. The
variation in the values of TiO2 restrains us to compare
it safely with the values of SiO2 and ZnO. It can be deduced
that the samples with SiO2, ZnO, and TiO2 IDLs
are promising for achieving good crystallinity by pulsed IR laser-based
LC. The thermal conductivity of SiNx lying
between 20 and 70 W/m/K29 is considerably
higher than that of SiO2 (1.14–1.31 W/m/K30) and TiO2 (6.5–8.5 W/m/K31). It is expected for SiNx to transfer the generated heat due to laser pulse absorption
in a-Si to the glass substrate without resulting in as high local
temperature increase and as high number of nucleation centers at the
a-Si layer as compared to SiO2 and TiO2 (see Table 1).

Thermal
conductivity of ZnO, about 37 W/m/K at room temperature,
depends strongly on temperature and drops below 4 W/m/K at a temperature
of 1000 °C32 to a range comparable
to those of SiO2 and TiO2. As can be seen in Table 1, mean grain sizes
of the samples with SiO2, ZnO, and TiO2 are
larger than those of bare glass and SiNx IDL, whereas the tensile stresses are lower, as can be expected
from Raman peak positions (see also Figure 3).

Electron Backscatter Diffraction
The samples were fine
polished to remove any amorphous nanoscale layers on the surface before
the inspection by EBSD. EBSD images were acquired on randomly chosen
samples among the LC-processed sample sets.

As seen in Figure 4, there exists a
variation in the grain sizes. The grain size can exceed 2 μm
in length for the samples with TiO2 and ZnO IDLs.

(a) no IDL, (b) SiNx, (c) SiO2, (d) TiO2, and (e) ZnO. Each color corresponds to a different
crystal orientation. (f) Color map of crystal orientations of Si.

Augmentation of the grain sizes
can be predicted from the red shift
of the Raman peaks. An inverse correlation between the grain size
and the red shift of the Raman peak was observed, as in reference.33 The decreasing grain sizes address an increase
in the tensile stress over the domains, in which this results in a
red shift of transverse optical modes in the one-phonon Raman peak.33−36 The biaxial tensile strain with an in-plane stress can be expressed
as the following35,37  where Δω is the red shift in the
Raman peak position of pc-Si with respect to the reference Raman peak
position of c-Si (at ∼521 cm–1) and the tensile
stress is given as σ in GPa units. Accordingly, the tensile
stress on the microcrystal domains takes values in between 0.1 and
0.9 GPa in our samples.

Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS)
As the a-Si
film reaches melting temperatures, the generated heat inevitably diffuses
to the underlying IDLs and glass substrate. Even solar glass substrates
contain a considerable amount of impurity atoms that can migrate at
elevated temperatures through the silica matrix and diffuse into the
IDLs and crystallized Si layer. It is of importance to test whether
the IDLs that are placed for thermal management can also function
as diffusion barriers or whether they give rise to impurities in crystallized
silicon themselves. To quantify these aspects, we have conducted secondary
ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) characterization of our samples (IONTOF
TOF.SIMS5) after crystallization. SIMS analyses showed
that the least impurity diffusion occurred in the sample with SiNx IDL, whereas the other three showed a similar
amount of impurity diffusion (see Figure 5). However, in the sample with SiNx IDL, neither the measured Raman peak position
nor the Raman peak FWHM is the closest to that of c-Si among all of
the tested samples with IDLs, suggesting that the crystalline quality
is not the best. It can be said that the thermal conductivities of
IDLs turn out to be a more dominant factor in the achieved crystalline
quality of the LC process.

the IDLs (a) SiNx, (b) SiO2, (c) ZnO, and (d) TiO2 for the concentration of common
impurity atoms.

Conclusions
In
laser-induced crystallization process of thin a-Si films, the
samples with SiO2, ZnO, and TiO2 intermediate
dielectric layers between the glass substrate and a-Si exhibit a better
performance than that of the samples with SiNx and the reference sample without IDL in terms of crystalline domain
size, stress buildup, and defect concentration, as can be seen from
EBSD domain analysis, Raman peak position, and Raman FWHM, respectively.
Our understanding is that the heat can accumulate on irradiated areas
with decreasing IDL thermal conductivity; consequently, the temperature
can be maintained high long enough to enlarge the grains in size after
the nucleation occurs. Such a correlation can be deduced by paying
attention to the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity
of TiO2 and ZnO IDLs (see Table 1). Expanding on that idea, one can suggest
that as the cooling is slow in low thermal conduction, the resulting
pc-Si domains are expected to contain less concentration of defects
(or to be less amorphous), which is supported by lower Raman peak
FWHM values observed in low thermal conductivity IDL samples. It can
further be suggested from Table 1 that the samples with IDLs of ZnO and TiO2 depict the formation of larger grains with less tensile stress because
of more effective accumulation of heat and longer sustainment of elevated
local temperature. Not only the crystal grains were increased in size
with SiO2, ZnO, and TiO2 IDLs, but also the
crystallinity of LC pc-Si was improved or amorphousness was reduced.
Consequently, the tensile stress between the grains could be reduced
to some extent with SiO2, ZnO, and TiO2 layers.
Besides the thermal conductivity management, the IDLs may also function
as diffusion barriers for the impurities originating from a glass
substrate. Our SIMS studies have shown that SiNx does function best as a diffusion barrier albeit it does
not provide the best crystalline quality. We found that the magnitude
of impurity diffusion is not as high to affect the crystalline quality
adversely for the studied IDLs.

This work provides a quantitative
comparison of the qualities of
laser-induced crystallization products with different intermediate
dielectric layers. Further studies have to be performed involving
multi-intermediate layer performances, focal spot engineering, film
thicknesses, and so forth, to assess the applicability of the method
as a useful tool in obtaining crystalline Si thin films at device
quality. We think that our findings will serve as a guide for future
optimization studies on the laser crystallization of a-Si thin films
and their applications.
