In
this paper, we report a high-speed, high-sensitivity, and economic
method to authenticate Maca. After being extracted by ethanol, nutritional
components of a dozen kinds of Maca were detected by electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry. Combined with principal component analysis
(PCA), these samples can be rapidly differentiated after selecting
the origins and principal components in the projection of components
1 and 2. The result suggests that sample 2 from Lijiang gets the highest
comprehensive score among the samples and sample 1 from Huize gets
the lowest comprehensive score among the samples in positive-ion mass
spectra. However, sample 2 from Peru gets the highest comprehensive
score among the samples and sample 3 from Lijiang gets the lowest
comprehensive score among the samples in negative-ion mass spectra.
Compared with the PCA results, the data of negative-ion mass spectra
can better differentiate these samples than those of positive-ion
mass spectra. This method has the advantages of easy operation and
high efficiency, which make it a differential tool in the fields of
food safety, medicinal chemistry, and materials science.

Introduction
Maca
(Lepidium meyenii), one of
the Cruciferae family, contains some active components such as alkaloid,
glucosinolate, sterol, and isothiocyanate, apart from macronutrients.
Alkaloids in Maca contain macamide,1 macaridine,2 β-carbazoline,3 imidazole alkaloid,4−6 and macahydantoin.7 Macamides,
the representative component of Maca, are secondary amides formed
by benzylamine and a fatty acid moiety with different hydrocarbon
chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation.8,9 Glucosinolate
is an important secondary metabolite in Maca. Glucotropaeolin is considered
to be the most abundant glucosinolate in Maca.10

The rich components give Maca several remarkable
biological activities.11 In fact, Maca
has been used as a functional
food to strengthen the human body, increase fertility, improve sexual
function, prevent depression and anemia in the Andes for centuries.
The pentane extract of Maca contains a number of macamides that may
act on the endocannabinoid system by inhibitory activity on fatty
acid amide hydrolase.12 Sterols or estrogens
in Maca have a positive effect on sexual behavior and spermatogenesis
in mice and men.1,13−15 Lep B in Maca
can inhibit nitrite production in macrophages.16 In conclusion, the promising pharmacological activity of
Maca has gradually won the approval of the customer.

Nowadays,
Maca is recommended as a food supplement and widely cultivated
in many countries and areas, especially China because it is efficacious
in treating cancer, anemia, gastritis, high blood pressure, erectile
dysfunction, infertility, stress, and depression.17−19 However, there
are different climate and planting environments of Maca between China
and Peru. Such differences may cause the different nutritional components
of Maca. Hence, it is important to study the effect of planting environments
on the nutritional components of Maca. Due to its high sensitivity,
excellent analytical efficiency, and simple sample preparation, electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) was used to differentiate Maca
from different origins.

Partial least squares discriminant analysis
(PLS-DA) is a supervised
analytical method which can achieve a classification performance by
reducing the dimension of complex data.20 It was reported that based on UV data of macamides, PLS-DA was designed
to discriminate Maca from different origins.21 Principal component analysis (PCA) uses the method of reduction
of dimensionality to find a data exploration relationship between
objects, to estimate the correlation structure of the variables, and
to investigate how many components (a linear combination of original
features) are necessary to explain the greater part of variance with
a minimum loss of information.22,23 In this paper, combined
with the mass spectral data, PCA was applied to successfully differentiate
a dozen kinds of samples with a simple extract technique and to study
the effect of origins on the constituents of Maca.

Results and Discussion
A dozen kinds of Maca, including Peru 1, 2, 3, Huize 1, 2, 3, Lijiang
1, 2, 3, Shangri-La 1, 2, and 3 were selected as typical samples to
analyze the nutritional components by ESIMS with PCA. Herein, 1, 2,
and 3 indicate three color types of Maca, namely purple, yellow, and
white, respectively. Peru, Huize, Lijiang, and Shangri-La show the
origins of Maca.

Mass Spectrometry Analysis
The mass
spectra for Peru
samples in different ion modes are shown in Figure 1. Compared with methods of mass spectrometry
(MS), ESIMS tends to form multiple adducts of analytes. We identify
the compounds by comparison of the detected m/z to the calculated theoretical m/z, gained fragment ion information, and that reported in
the published literature (Table S1 in the
Supporting Information). The dominant peak at m/z 116.0706 corresponds to [Pro + H]+ in positive-ion
ESIMS. The peaks at m/z 104.0496,
175.1190, and 381.0794 correspond to [Bn + H]+, [Arg +
H]+, and [Suc + K]+, respectively. The peaks
at m/z 252.1969 and 270.2074 correspond
to [NBoa + H2O + H]+ and [NBoa +2H2O + H]+, which are called macamide in Maca by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)–UV–MS/MS.8 The peaks at m/z 277.1709
and 291.1855 correspond to [Lep A – Cl]+ and [Lep
B – Cl]+, which are known to be imidazole alkaloids
from the root of Maca by spectroscopic methods.24 The peak at m/z 408.2663
corresponds to [NBD + K]+, which belongs to macamide in
Maca by HPLC–UV–MS/MS.8

2 in positive-ion mode, (D) sample 2 in negative-ion mode, (E) sample
3 in positive-ion mode, and (F) sample 3 in negative-ion mode.

In negative-ion ESIMS, the dominant peak at m/z 133.0142 corresponds to [HA –
H]− in Figure 1B, the
dominant peak at m/z 376.0366 corresponds
to [HPGlu – H]− in Figure 1D, and the dominant peak at m/z 408.0428 corresponds to [BGlu – H]− in Figure 1F.25,26 The peaks at m/z 179.0561, 255.2330, and 279.2320 correspond to
[DA – H]−, [PA – H]−, and [LA – H]−, respectively, which were
analyzed as methyl esters after hydrolysis in potassium hydroxide
solution by gas chromatography (GC).27,28 The peaks
at m/z 341.1090 and 683.2241 correspond
to [Suc – H]− and [Tetra + H2O
– H]−. The peak at m/z 431.3086 corresponds to [Erg + Cl]−,
which is determined to be sterol in Maca by GC.11 The peaks at m/z 456.0629
and 474.0735 may correspond to [MBGlu + H2O – H]− and [MBGlu + 2H2O – H]−, which belong to glucosinolates by GC-MS.26,29

In conclusion, samples 1 and 2 from Peru contain the same
nutritional
components, including Bn, Pro, Arg, NBoa, Lep A, Lep B, Suc, HA, DA,
PA, LA, HPGlu, BGlu, Erg, MBGlu, Tetra, and so on. Sample 3 from Peru
contains the same nutritional components as those of samples 1 and
2, except NBD.

Figure 2 shows the
mass spectra for Huize samples by ESIMS in different modes. The peak
of protonated Pro is observed as a dominant signal in positive-ion
MS of Huize samples. The peak at m/z 370.3104 corresponds to [NBD + H]+, which is called macamides
in Maca by HPLC–UV–MS/MS.8 The peaks at m/z 346.3104 and
384.2897 may correspond to [NBha + H]+ and [NBOO + H]+, which are benzylated alkamides (macamides) from the tuber
of Maca by one-dimensional and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopic analyses.2

The nutritional components of sample 3 from Huize are Pro, Arg, HA,
NBoa, Lep A, NBha, NBD, Suc, NBOO, HA, DA, PA, LA, HPGlu, MBGlu, and
Tetra.

The peak of protonated Pro is observed as a dominant
signal in
positive-ion MS of Lijiang samples. The peak of deprotonated DA is
observed as a dominant signal in Figure 3B, and the peak of deprotonated Suc is observed
as a dominant signal in Figure 3D,F, respectively. The nutritional components of samples 1
and 2 from Lijiang are Pro, Arg, DA, NBoa, Lep B, Suc, HA, PA, LA,
HPGlu, BGlu, MBGlu, and Tetra; however, those of sample 3 from Lijiang
are Arg, Suc, HA, PA, LA, HPGlu, BGlu, MBGlu, and Tetra.

3 in positive-ion mode, and (F) sample 3 in negative-ion mode.

The mass spectra for Shangri-La samples in different
ion modes
are given in Figure 4. The signal of protonated Pro is shown as the base peak in Figure 4A,C, and the signal
of dechlorided Lep B is shown as the base peak in Figure 4E, respectively. The signal
of deprotonated BGlu is shown as base peak in Figure 4B,D, and the signal of deprotonated Suc is
shown as the base peak in Figure 4F, respectively. The result shows that these samples
from Shangri-La contain the same nutritional components.

mode.

Principal Component Analysis
The nutritional components
including amino acid, macamide, imidazole alkaloid, glucosinolate,
oligosaccharide, and aliphatic acid in these samples were detected
by ESIMS. These samples were extracted and analyzed six times at the
same experimental conditions. Means and standard deviation values
of the relative intensity of several peaks in the mass spectra of
these samples are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Data are shown as mean
± standard deviation. It was observed that the relative intensity
of Pro is the greatest in the samples, except that in sample 1 from
Shangri-La in Table 1. However, there is much difference among the analytical data of
nutritional components in these samples in Table 2.

PCA was applied to analyze and process
the mass spectral data of
Maca to further discuss the difference of the nutritional components
among these samples.23,30 Four principal components with
eigenvalues higher than one accounting for 94.71 and 78.90% of total
variance are obtained in Tables 3 and 4. From the loadings of
the variables (Table 3), mainly Bn and Arg are the dominant features in the first principal
component, accounting for 37.89% of the total variability, Lep A and
B dominate in the second principal component, representing 31.10%
of the total variance, and Suc and NBoa in the third and fourth principal
component, representing 14.17 and 11.55% of the total variance, respectively.
In Table 4, DA is the
dominant feature in the first principal component, accounting for
25.05% of the total variability, Tetra dominates in the second principal
component, representing 21.19% of the total variance, and HPGlu and
MBGlu dominate in the third and fourth principal component, representing
16.62 and 16.04% of the total variance.

The scores
and ranks of the ingredients of Maca (Tables S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information) were used
to evaluate the quality of the samples from different origins and
colors. The result in positive-ion mass spectra shows that sample
2 from Lijiang gets the highest comprehensive score among the samples
but sample 1 from Huize gets the lowest (Table S2 in the Supporting Information). The result in negative-ion
mass spectra shows that sample 2 from Peru gets the highest comprehensive
score among the samples but sample 3 from Lijiang gets the lowest
(Table S3 in the Supporting Information).

The PCA plots were applied to further differentiate these samples.
Scores (PC1 and PC2) corresponding to different origins of samples
are also plotted in Figure 5. Samples from Huize are distributed in the lower left quadrant,
and samples 2 and 3 from Huize are difficult to differentiate in Figure 5A. In addition, it
is also difficult to differentiate among sample 3 from Lijiang and
samples 2 and 3 from Shangri-La. However, in Figure 5B, except sample 1 from Peru and sample 3
from Shangri-La, other samples differentiate well. In conclusion,
for these samples, each data item distributes in special regions and
the center of each region is not overlapping in the PCA map. The result
suggests that these samples can be rapidly differentiated by ESIMS
combined with PCA.

samples.
Correlations between the growing regions and principal components

Compared with the PCA results, the data of negative-ion MS
can
better differentiate these samples than those of positive-ion MS.
This method can also be applied to classify and distinguish food,
drug, and material. The study of a novel extraction method of macamide
and differentiation of Maca from different origins based on macamide
is currently in progress in our laboratories.

Materials and
Methods
All kinds of Maca were purchased from Fengxi Tea
Shop (Kunming,
China). Methanol was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (Massachusetts).
Other chemicals were from Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Factory
(Tianjin, China). All chemicals used were of highest purity and without
further purification.

Maca samples were gained from high altitudes
(2500–3500
m) and dried in the sun with less than 5% of water content. Ten individuals
in the same batch were mixed together and then pulverized. Maca powder
was sieved through a 60-mesh stainless steel sieve. To maximize the
dissolution of nutritional components of Maca, 75% ethanol (3 ×
10 mL) is used for extraction at room temperature by an ultrasonic
method. Then, the extract is filtered and the filtrate is collected.
The filtrate was diluted to 50 mL with 75% ethanol and filtered through
a 0.22 μm membrane filter before analysis by ESIMS.

Mass
spectral experiments were performed with a time-of-flight
mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, micrOTOF II). The experimental
parameters were as follows: flow rate of the sample solution: 2 ×
10–3 mL·min–1; flow rate
of nitrogen: 4 L·min–1; temperature of dry
gas: 200 °C; voltage of capillary: 2.6 kV in both positive and
negative-ion modes; voltage off end plate offset: 0.5 kV. The MicrOTOF
control software of the ESIMS instrument was used to record the full
scan mass spectra at the mass range of 50–800 Da.

The
software SPSS 24.0 was applied to differentiate Maca from different
origins based on the nutritional components.
