The complexes [PtMe2(L)], L = 2-C5H4NCH2NH-x-C6H4OH (x = 2, 3, or 4),
react with iodine to form [PtI2Me2(L)], by trans oxidative addition, when x = 3 or 4,
and they are shown to have polymeric or sheet structures formed through
NH···I hydrogen bonding. However, ligand dissociation
occurs when x = 2 to give [(PtI2Me2)n] and, with methyl group transfer,
the complex [(PtIMe3·PtI2Me2)2]. This tetraplatinum cluster complex is shown to have
a double cubane structure, thus solving a longstanding puzzle.

Introduction
Trimethylplatinum iodide
was the first alkyl complex of a transition
metal to be reported, so it is important in the development of organometallic
chemistry.1 Many related complexes have
since been reported and they have the classic cubane structure [(PtXMe3)4], A, Chart 1, typically with X– = halide,
OH–, SR–, in which each platinum(IV)
center is octahedral and each anion is triply bridging.2−4 There are also dialkylplatinum dihalides [(PtX2R2)n], including those with R =
Me and R2 = C3H6 (the first metallacyclobutane
complex), and mixed complexes [(PtXMe3·PtX2Me2)n].4−6 On the basis
of vibrational spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, as well as by analogy
to the established structure A, the complexes [(PtXMe3·PtX2Me2)n] and [(PtX2R2)n] were assigned cubane structures such as B or C, respectively, with two (B) or four (C) terminal Pt–X bonds as well as the four Pt3(μ3-X) groups.4,5 These halide complexes
are insoluble in noncoordinating solvents, and it was not possible
to grow crystals to confirm the proposed structures crystallographically.
More recently, the complexes [{Pt(OH)Me3·Pt(OH)2Me2}2] and [{Pt(OH)Me3·Pt(OMe)2Me2}2] were prepared and shown to have
the double cubane structure D, X = OH or OMe, which contain
no terminal Pt–X bonds.7 It was
suggested that the halide complexes [(PtXMe3·PtX2Me2)n] might also have
this structure instead of B and that the complexes [(PtX2R2)n] might have a
polymeric structure E instead of C (Chart 1), but no proof was
possible at that time.7 This paper describes
the synthesis and structures of some new platinum(IV) iodide complexes
and their supramolecular chemistry. In this study, crystals of the
Hall cluster [(PtIMe3·PtI2Me2)2] were obtained,4 and it
is finally proved after 47 years to have the double cubane structure D.

Results and Discussion
As part of a study on the effect
of ligands with hydrogen bonding
substituents on reactivity and mechanism in oxidative addition reactions
of dimethylplatinum(II) complexes,8 the
aminopyridine ligands L1–L3, which contain phenol
substituents at the amine donor, were studied (Scheme 1).9−11 The ligands contain both an NH
group and an OH group, which might act as hydrogen bond donors. Ligand L1 has been used often,9 but L2 and L3 are not so well-known and are incompletely
characterized.10,11 The reaction between [Pt2Me4(μ-SMe2)2], 1,12 and these ligands gave an
equilibrium mixture, which contained cis-[PtMe2(SMe2)2], 2,12 the expected product [PtMe2(L)], 3–5, and free ligands L and SMe2, as monitored
by 1H NMR spectroscopy in acetone-d6 solution (Scheme 1, Figures S5–S7), and they
were not isolated but were prepared and used in solution for subsequent
studies. As an example, in the 1H NMR spectrum for complex 3 in acetone-d6, two methyl platinum
resonances were observed at δ 0.24 and 0.65, with satellites
with coupling constants 2J(PtH) = 86 and
90 Hz, respectively, in the range expected for methylplatinum(II)
complexes.8 The complexes have no symmetry,
and therefore, the CH2 group has nonequivalent CHaHb protons.

Scheme 1 Ligands L1–L3 and the
Synthesis of the Dimethylplatinum(II)
Complexes 3–5
The reactions of complexes 4 and 5 with
iodine occurred in the expected way to give the corresponding platinum(IV)
complexes 6 and 7 by trans oxidative addition
(Scheme 2).13 The 1H NMR spectra of 6 contained two methylplatinum resonances at δ = 1.75, 2J(PtH) = 74 Hz, and δ = 2.40, 2J(PtH) = 75 Hz, and the lower values of the
coupling constants indicate the formation of a platinum(IV) complex.8,13 The methylene group gave two sharp CHaHb doublets
of doublet peaks at δ(1H) = 5.08 [2J(HaHb) = 15 Hz; 3J(CH2–NH) = 4 Hz] and 5.53 [2J(HaHb) = 15 Hz; 3J(CH2–NH) = 12 Hz] (Figure S8). The NMR data are consistent with
the proposed structure (Scheme 2) but do not define the stereochemistry. However, the structures
were finally proved by structure determinations (Figure 1). Each platinum center contains
two cis methyl groups, the chelate ligand L3 or L4, and two trans iodide ligands, as expected for the trans
oxidative addition reaction. Complex 6 is not solvated,
but the lattice of complex 7 contains an acetone solvate
molecule, which is hydrogen-bonded to the phenol proton (Figure 1).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Complexes 6 and 7
The supramolecular structures
of complexes 6 and 7, formed by intermolecular
NH···I and/or OH···I
hydrogen bonding, are shown in Figures 2 and 3. For complex 7, the phenol proton is hydrogen-bonded to a solvate molecule of acetone
(Figure 1), so there
is only NH···I intermolecular hydrogen bonding and
a one-dimensional polymer is formed. Each molecule is chiral at the
amine nitrogen, with R or S configurations,
and the polymer chains are syndiotactic, with alternating RSRS configurations of neighboring molecules (Figure 2). For complex 6, there is both intermolecular NH···I and OH···I
hydrogen bonding, so each molecule forms four hydrogen bonds to four
different neighbors, two as donors and two as acceptors. Two of these
neighbors have the same configuration and two have the opposite configuration,
so each sheet is racemic (Figure 3).

The reaction of the equilibrium mixture of complexes 2 and 3 in acetonitrile solution occurred in
a different
way to give [(PtIMe3·PtI2Me2)2], 8, and [(PtI2Me2)n], 9, as shown in Scheme 3, with loss of the
ligand L1. The reaction immediately gave an insoluble
brown precipitate, identified as mostly the known complex 9.4 Filtration of the mixture, followed
by slow diffusion of ether into the acetonitrile solution, then gave
orange crystals identified as complex 8.4 The formation of 8 requires a methyl-transfer
reaction to form the trimethylplatinum(IV) groups and should also
give a monomethylplatinum complex which was not identified. Such methyl-transfer
reactions are well-known and may occur either by direct methyl for
halogen exchange or by a redox mechanism involving methyl iodide transfer
from platinum(IV) to a dimethylplatinum(II) complex.14 The formation of 8 and 9 also
requires dissociation of the ligands L1 and dimethylsulfide
on the oxidation to platinum(IV), a reaction which is common with
dimethylsulfide complexes but infrequent with chelate ligands.7 Steric effects of the ortho hydroxyl group in L1 probably account for the difference in the reaction of
complex 3 with iodine compared to the simple oxidative
addition observed for 4 and 5 (Scheme 2). This steric effect
is not important in forming the platinum(II) complex 3 and indeed may be helpful in forming a Pt···HO hydrogen
bond in 3(8) but is expected
to be more important in an octahedral platinum(IV) complex analogous
to 6 or 7. The structure of complex 9 shown in Scheme 3 is tentative, but the structure of 8 was determined
and is shown in Figure 4. It finally confirms the prediction that the complex [(PtIMe3·PtI2Me2)2], 8, has the face-bridged double cubane framework with two vertices
missing and not the originally proposed simple cubane structure B (Chart 1).4,7 Each platinum(IV) center has octahedral stereochemistry. The two
trimethylplatinum(IV) groups [Me3Pt(1) and Me3Pt(1A)] are at either end of the cluster, and the two dimethylplatinum(IV)
units [Me2Pt(2) and Me2Pt(2A)] are at the center.
Two of the iodide groups are triply bridging, μ3-I
[I(2) and I(2A)], and the other four are doubly bridging, μ2-I ligands [I(1), I(1a), I(3), I(3a)]. The triply bridging
μ3-I ligands [I(2) and I(2A)] are trans to carbon,
and the Pt–I distances fall in the range 2.812(1)–2.814(1)
Å. However, the doubly bridging, μ2-I groups
[I(1), I(1a), I(3), I(3a)] are trans to both carbon and iodine, and
the distances Pt(1)–I(3) = 2.814(1) and Pt(1)–I(1) =
2.808(1) Å trans to methyl are longer than the distances Pt(2)–I(3)
= 2.644(1) and Pt(2)–I(1) = 2.634(1) Å.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Complexes 8 and 9
Conclusions
The aminomethylpyridine ligands L1–L3 do not
coordinate strongly to the dimethylplatinum(II) center, as shown by
the inability to completely displace the dimethylsulfide ligands from
[PtMe2(SMe2)2] (Scheme 1). Qualitatively, the equilibrium
constants for the formation of the new dimethylplatinum(II) complexes
follow the sequence L3 > L1 > L2 (Scheme 2 and Figures S5–S7). However, L2 and L3 bind relatively more strongly to platinum(IV),
compared to L1, and selectively form [PtI2Me2(L)] by trans oxidative addition of iodine.
These complexes form a supramolecular polymer (L3) or
sheet (L2) by intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The ligand L1 evidently binds less strongly and the complex [PtMe2(L1)] reacts with iodine with loss of the ligand
to form the bridging iodide complexes [(PtIMe3·PtI2Me2)2], 8, and [(PtI2Me2)n], 9.4 Complex 8 was prepared
much earlier,4 but it is essentially insoluble
in most organic solvents and so could not be crystallized. It was
assigned a simple cubane structure B (Chart 1),4 but this is now shown to be incorrect and the face-bridged double
cubane structure, with two missing vertices, is established crystallographically
(Figure 4). It is very
likely that other complexes with stoichiometry [(PtXR3·PtX2R2)n] also have this
structure. The structure containing μ2-I and μ3-I units is evidently preferred over the simple cubane structure,
which contains terminal iodide and μ3-I units. The
M4X6 dicubane structure is known, with X = complex
oxygen donor ligands, in complexes of nickel and cobalt and in some
mixed metal clusters.15 However, complex 8 is the simplest example and so can be considered as a paradigm
for the unusual structure.7,15

Experimental Section
NMR spectra were recorded using Bruker 400, Inova 400, and Inova
600 NMR spectrometers. Spectra are referenced to tetramethylsilane
and assignments are given according to the labeling scheme in Chart 2. Single-crystal X-ray
diffraction measurements were made using a Bruker APEX-II CCD diffractometer
with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å)
radiation. Single crystals of the complexes were immersed in paraffin
oil and mounted on MiteGen micromounts. The structures were solved
using direct methods and refined by the full-matrix least-squares
procedure of SHELXTL. Crystallographic data are given in the CIF files
(CCDC 1834513–1834515). The ligand L1 and complex
[Pt2Me4(μ-SMe2)2] were synthesized according to literature procedures.9,12

washed with pentane, and dried in vacuo. Yield: 0.013 g, 10%. Once
formed, the crystals of 8 were insoluble in common organic
solvents.4
