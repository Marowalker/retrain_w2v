The prevalence of pharmaceutical compounds in surface
and groundwater
presents a rising threat to human health. As such, the search for
novel materials that serve to avoid their release into the environment
or for the remediation once in the water effluent is of utmost importance.
The present work describes the fabrication of a cellulose acetate
membrane modified with the block copolymer poly(4-vinylpyridine-b-ethylene oxide) (P4VP-b-PEO) crafted
for the specific targeting and adsorption of electron-deficient pharmaceuticals
(EDPs). The EDPs under study were sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine,
and omeprazole. The results as part of this work present a thorough
characterization of the prepared membranes by FTIR, contact angle
measurement, and SEM images. Moreover, results show that the adsorptive
character of the membrane correlates with the relative electron deficiency
and spatial orientation of the contaminant. Interestingly, the addition
of nominal 1% P4VP-b-PEO to the cellulose matrix
helps to increase the adsorption efficiency of the membranes by at
least 2-fold in most cases. For the compounds studied, the prepared
membrane has a higher efficiency toward omeprazole followed by sulfamethoxazole
and sulfadiazine. This work may serve to inspire the design and fabrication
of selective soft materials for the adsorption and remediation of
contaminants of emerging concern.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The ability of a society
to provide fresh water for hygiene and
consumption to the population is perhaps one of the most important
items for the sustained growth of developing countries and the expansion
of urban areas. Nevertheless, with the increase in population and
urbanization, the release of toxic compounds into the environment
and surface water also increases. The sources of contamination in
surface and groundwater are diverse, including agricultural, industrial,
oil pollution, sewage, and wastewater1 among
many others.

In recent years, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) has
become very proactive in informing the community about the contaminants
of emerging concern (CECs). CECs are a class of contaminants of diverse
origins that are typically detected at trace levels in surface and
groundwater (i.e., ppb, ppt). Examples of CECs are pesticides, hormones,
antibiotics, over-the-counter medications, agricultural byproducts,
industrial chemicals, petroleum-based chemicals, and others.2 A recent study conducted by Bai et al. accounts
for the presence of numerous pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and waste-indicator
compounds in the metropolitan area of Denver, Colorado.3 Findings like this one are of concern since even
at low levels, some CECs are quite harmful to human health.4 The biggest concern related to the presence of
CECs in surface and groundwater is their potential to act as endocrine
disruptor compounds (EDCs). There is vast evidence in the cited literature
that the absorption of EDCs is the cause of hormone blockage or mimicry
and may cause prenatal development, metabolic diseases, and other
health-related issues.5

Also, concern
exists where these compounds may affect aquatic life,6 and their presence in groundwater has been correlated
to disrupted microorganism composition in communities and a rise of
antibiotic resistant strains.7 Other studies
have suggested that the presence of certain CECs in water may lead
to fish species to uptake considerable amounts of the compounds, which
will ultimately be ingested by humans.8

Although in principle, the processes employed in wastewater
treatment
plants may remove CECs, this is not always the case.9,10 In fact, some of these processes are not accounted actual removal
methods, and the byproducts that are created such as organochlorine
species can be more toxic than the initial compounds.11−15 As a strategy to cope with the presence of CECs in surface and groundwater,
researchers have proposed the use of activated carbons,16 nanofiltration,17−19 reverse osmosis,20 ultrafiltration, degradation with microorganisms,
and electrooxidation among others.21 Nevertheless,
the adsorption of CECs with activated carbon is a preferred method
because of the material’s porosity (surface area), which allows
for effective adsorption of the contaminants.22,23 However, the production of activated carbon demands considerable
amounts of energy, and activated carbon pores can easily undergo fouling,
drastically reducing its adsorption efficiency.24,25

Materials scientists have sought multiple solutions to mitigate
the disadvantages of activated carbon by directly attending to the
drawbacks of the material26 or fabricating
alternative carbonaceous materials. For example, Turk Sekulic et al.
reported a phosphorized carbonaceous adsorbent that was capable of
sustaining π–π EDA interactions with their contaminants
of interest with a maximum adsorption of 99%.27 Further alternative materials for the removal of CECs have been
fabricated in the form of cationic surfactants and organo-montmorillonites.28,29

Certainly, the use of membranes is considered quite promising
and
a viable technology that can be employed to remove CECs from wastewater
and drinking water.30 Membrane technologies
such as forward osmosis (FO) and reverse osmosis (RO) have been extensively
studied for the rejection of CECs. However, these methods still rely
on physical rejection, and as such, there is no selectivity, and organic
fouling is still an issue.31−36 Despite the advances in polymer synthesis and membrane production
technologies, insufficient or no research has been performed to tackle
the water remediation of CECs. This is a consequence of the lack of
selectivity and poor cost-effectiveness of polymers used in commercial
purification membranes. We hypothesize that porous adsorption membranes
are a feasible strategy to overcome the deficiencies of these common
methods. Adsorption can be controlled by the addition of specific
functionalities to polymeric rearrangement, producing high porosity.
These functionalities can also allow the reusability of the membranes
by reversible adsorption as a response to external stimuli.

Thus, herein, we propose the manufacture and study of a cellulose
acetate-based membrane capable of adsorbing CECs that are electron-deficient
pharmaceuticals (EDPs). In this study, we used phase inversion to
fabricate a membrane out of cellulose acetate (CA) modified with poly
(4-vinylpyridine-b-ethylene oxide) (P4VP-b-PEO), two polymers capable of sustaining electrostatic
interactions with positively charged molecules. Cellulose acetate
(Figure 2a) is ubiquitously
regarded as a resilient and biodegradable support for water purification
membranes.37 Additionally, P4VP-b-PEO (Figure 2b) was chosen because our previous studies suggest that it is capable
of sustaining electrostatic π–π interactions with
the deactivated rings of the EDPs38 as
seen in Figure 2c.
We embedded the block copolymer P4VP-b-PEO into the
cellulose acetate support and tested the membrane in a gradient of
electron-deficient pharmaceuticals (EDPs), establishing a correlation
between the general electronegativity of the EDPs and the adsorption
capacity of the membrane.

The EDPs studied are two antibiotics
and a commonplace pharmaceutical:
sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadiazine (SDZ), and omeprazole (OMZ),
respectively. The first two are sulfonamide antibiotics frequently
prescribed to treat bacterial infections in humans and animals.39 These compounds pose the serious threat of altering
microorganismal communities and inducing antibiotic resistance as
is reported extensively in the literature.40−43 Omeprazole is a highly accessible
nonprescription medication used to treat heartburn, and it is characterized
for its chemical instability.44 This compound
is prone to quick degradation due to numerous environmental factors
such as pH, heat, and light.44 More interesting
is the fact that these degradation intermediates are highly electron-deficient
and may serve to validate the model membranes in this work.45 These three pharmaceuticals were chosen because
they are substituted with prominent electron-withdrawing groups, as
are many other pharmaceuticals. According to the World Health Organization,
the selected compounds are frequently found in most groundwater studies,
in a varying range of regions and concentrations ranging from parts
per billion to parts per million.46 Hence,
the current study focuses on fabricating and evaluating a CA-supported
membrane capable of adsorbing EDPs, studying the intertwine between
the relative electron deficiency of the compounds and the membrane’s
adsorbing capacity. This work provides a feasible approach to the
targeted removal of EDPs from aqueous media using environmentally
friendly and sustainable components.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Cellulose acetate (CA;
39.8 wt % acetyl, Mn ∼ 30,000),
acetone HPLC plus (99.9%), N,N-dimethylacetamide
reagent plus (DMAc, 99%), analytical standard sulfamethoxazole (SMX),
analytical standard sulfadiazine (SDZ), and analytical standard omeprazole
(OMZ) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Poly(4-vinylpyridine-b-ethylene oxide) (P4VP-b-PEO, 20 to 5
kDa) was purchased from Polymer Source Inc. (Dorval, QC, Canada).
All reagents were used without further purification. A polyester mesh
with 105 μm mesh openings and 52% open area was purchased from
ELKO Filtering Co, LLC. Nanopure water from an Aries FilterWorks Gemini
high-purity water system (18.23 MΩ/cm) (Berlin, NJ, USA) was
used in all experiments.

2.2 Preparation of CA/P4VP-b-PEO
Membranes
CA membranes reinforced with the polyester mesh
were prepared by the non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) process
as published elsewhere.47,48 Casting solutions were
prepared dissolving 17wt % CA and varying concentrations of P4VP-b-PEO (0 and 1 wt %) in 2:1 w/w acetone/DMAc. Solutions
were left to magnetically stir at 400 rpm for 48 h at room temperature.
A polyester mesh was attached to a clean glass plate using metal clips.
Dissolved polymer solutions were casted over the polyester mesh using
a film-casting doctor blade (MTI Corp. Richmond, CA, USA) adjusted
to 150 μm. Films were allowed approximately 5 s for evaporation
of the solvents before they were immersed in nanopure water (non-solvent)
for 10 min. Finally, membranes were cut to a specific size, rinsed,
and stored in nanopure water.

2.3 Characterization of the Membranes
2.3.1 Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
CA Membranes were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy using a Bruker Tensor 27 attenuated total reflectance
(ATR) spectrometer (Billerica, MA, USA). The spectral width ranged
from 400–4000 cm–1 for 64 accumulation scans
and 4 cm–1 of resolution.

2.3.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy
In
order to assay the surface morphology of the CA membranes, a JEOL
6480LV scanning electron microscope (Peabody, MA, USA) in the secondary
electron imaging (SEI) mode with a 15 kV accelerating voltage was
used.

2.3.3 Contact Angle Measurements
The
wettability of the CA membranes was tested by contact angle measurements
performed with a Krüss drop shape analyzer DSA25S (Krüss
Optronic, Hamburg, Germany) at room temperature. Membranes were cut
to obtain 1 cm2 pieces that were fixed to the stage of
the instrument using carbon tape. To start the analysis, a 4.50 μL
nanopure water droplet was released from a syringe with a 25-gauge
flat needle (0.51 mm inner diameter, 0.26 mm outer diameter) onto
the surface of the sample. Images of the drop were recorded every
0.5 s up to 120 s (to avoid changes due to evaporation of the drop)
and analyzed in real-time using the Advance software (version 1.8).

2.4 Computational Analysis
Spartan 16
(Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) was used to model the molecules
SMX, SDZ, and OMZ in order to generate their electron density maps.
Calculations were performed based on density functional theory (DFT),
and geometries of the molecules were optimized at BLYP/6-31G*.

2.5 Adsorption Batch Tests of Sulfamethoxazole,
Sulfadiazine, and Omeprazole Using the CA Membranes
2.5.1 Adsorption Comparison between 17% CA and
1% P4VP-b-PEO 17% CA
17% CA and 1% P4VP-b-PEO
(composite) membranes of uniform size and weight were exposed to separate
30 mL solutions of 30 ppm SMX, SDZ, and OMZ at 25 °C and 250
rpm in a Brunswick shaker incubator (Series 2000) for 4 h. Afterward,
the membranes were removed, and the solutions were analyzed by UV–vis.
A Shimadzu UV Spectrophotometer UV-1800 was used to obtain the absorbance
of both, the solutions were exposed to the membranes and controls
to calculate their respective concentrations. In order to obtain the
equilibrium adsorption amount of the membranes, we used the following
formula  where qe is the
equilibrium adsorption amount (mg/g), C0 is the initial concentration of SMX, SDZ, or OMZ (mg/L), Ce is the equilibrium concentration of SMX, SDZ,
or OMZ after the adsorption (mg/L), V is the volume
of the pharmaceutical solutions, and w is the mass
of the CA membrane before the experiment was carried out. All experiments
were performed in triplicate.

2.5.2 Adsorption as a Function of Time
Membranes cut into rectangular shapes with consistent areas and weights
were exposed to 30 mL solutions of 30 ppm SMX, SDZ, and OMZ at 25
°C and 250 rpm in a Brunswick shaker incubator (Series 2000).
The adsorption equilibration times ranged from 5 min to 24 h.

2.5.3 Cyclic Reusability Testing
In order
to assay the reusability of the material, membranes were exposed to
30 mL of a 30 ppm solution of each pharmaceutical for a contact time
of 1 h at 25 °C and 250 rpm. Afterward, the membranes were immersed
in EtOH (95 wt %) for 20 min and later in nanopure water for 10 min
under the same experimental conditions. Membranes were dried with
compressed air and used for another batch adsorption cycle. All solutions
were measured using UV–vis, and the equilibrium adsorption
amount (qe) was calculated for each cycle.

3 Results and Discussion
Foremost, the
structures of the pharmaceuticals under study must
be taken into consideration. As seen in Figure 1, the three compounds under study vary in
their spatial arrangement as well as their degree of electron-withdrawing
substitution. The central feature to the π–π interactions
with P4VP-b-PEO lies in the electron-deficient aromatic
ring that can be observed in the electron density maps of each molecule. Figure S1 shows the highly electron-deficient
degradation intermediates of omeprazole.

Figure 1 Molecular structures

Figure 2 depicts the polymeric constituents of the
composite
membrane, cellulose acetate (Figure 2a), and P4VP-b-PEO (Figure 2b), as well as the electron
donor acceptance (EDA) interactions between the pyridine ring of the
block copolymer and the aromatic rings of the EDPs.

membrane: (a) cellulose acetate, (b)
P4VP-b-PEO, and (c) a schematic of the EDA interactions
that take place on the aromatic rings of the EDPs and the pyridine
ring of P4VP-b-PEO.

Before exploring the capacity of the membrane to
adsorb the compounds
of interest, it was of utmost importance to verify the membranes’
physical characteristics. First, SEM micrographs were obtained for
both the CA membrane and the composite membrane as seen in Figure 3. Upon analyzing
the composite membrane, it can be observed that the front and back
sides are smooth surfaces with minor deformations (Figure 3a,b, respectively). However,
the cross section of the membrane (Figure 3c) shows a large number of pores, which are
formed during the nucleation that occurs during phase separation.49 Even though the presence of pores is confirmed,
no apparent connection or channels between the pores can be detected
in the top and bottom surfaces of the membrane. This implicates that
the flow of water through the membrane would be limited due to the
disconnection between the inner pore structures, while minimizing
the surface area for the OH groups to interact with the EDPs. On the
other hand, the composite membrane displays small pores in the front
side and large pores in the back side (Figure 3d,e, respectively). Moreover, the cross section
(Figure 3f) showed
hierarchical pores that connect both sides of the membrane, suggesting
the potential flux of water through the membrane since porosity and
pore connectivity are directly related to permeability.50Figure S2 shows that
increasing the concentration of P4VP-b-PEO induces
more hierarchical pores. This behavior can only be explained by the
presence of P4VP-b-PEO. During phase separation,
the hydrophilic ethylene oxide chains of the block copolymer allow
a higher amount of water (non-solvent) to penetrate into the CA matrix,
changing the overall nucleation effects.

CA and composite membranes. Micrographs

CA membranes. SEM micrographs of the (d) front side, (e) back side,
and (f) cross section of the composite membranes.

In order to prove the chemical integrity of the
composite membrane,
FTIR was performed, and the spectra showed the different functional
groups found in CA, P4VP-b-PEO, and the composite
membrane. Figure 4a
shows the FTIR spectra of both membranes and the block copolymer by
itself. Hence, a thorough analysis of the spectra for the composite
membrane is described as follows. A signal at ∼1730 cm–1 that corresponds to the carbonyl of the acetyl group
can be easily observed. Also, the band at 1370 cm–1 corresponds to the bending vibration of methylene groups (−CH2), and the intense band at 1217 cm–1 corresponds
to the (−C–O) stretching vibration. Moreover, a sharp
band around 1030 cm–1 corresponds to the glycosidic
ring stretching.51 Despite the lack of
difference between the CA membrane and the P4VP-b-PEO-modified membrane, a close inspection reveals a new band at
1596 cm–1 (inset spectra) that is likely due to
vibrations of the pyridine ring that are also present in the spectrum
of P4VP-b-PEO.52 It should
be noted that the low intensity of that band is somewhat expected
since the FTIR method used only analyzes the surface of the material
while P4VP-b-PEO is expected to be mostly embedded
in the material.

Figure 4 (Left) FTIR spectra for CA, P4VP-b-PEO,
and the
composite membrane and (right) contact angle measurements for both
membranes.

Another important measure of these types of materials
is related
to the surface energy of the membrane that can be quantitatively assessed
by contact angle measurements. Figure 4b shows the contact angle results for both the CA membrane
and the composite membrane. Considering that the CA used in this study
has a 39.8 wt % substitution, membranes were expected to have considerable
wettability. In the case of the CA membrane, the contact angle is
60° at time 0 s. After 120 s, the value decreases to 50°
due to water penetration, a process mediated by diffusion through
the membrane. When examining CA membranes modified with P4VP-b-PEO,
a similar result is observed (contact angle of 60°) since P4VP-b-PEO
is not expected to change the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the
membrane. However, after 120 s, there is no apparent change in the
contact angle. This phenomenon can be attributed to the hydrophobic
air molecules found within the superficial pores that come into contact
with the water droplet and, therefore, reduce penetration of water
into the membrane. Therefore, the observed hydrophobic effect may
not be inherently attributed to the membrane’s chemical composition
since the morphology of the pores is a contributing factor.

In order to determine the enhancing effect of adding P4VP-b-PEO, single-point contact time experiments were carried
out with both membranes. The single-point contact time experiments
shown in Figure 5a
indicate that modifying the membrane with 1% P4VP-b-PEO induces a nearly 4-fold increase of OMZ adsorption and a 2-fold
increase in SMX adsorption. It should be noted that the high adsorption
of OMZ can be due to the highly electron-deficient degradation intermediates of OMZ. So forth,
SDZ adsorption is minimal; however, an increase in adsorptivity can
be detected. These results suggest that CA has a notable adsorptive
character due the Coulombic interactions that occur between the OH
groups and the partially positive regions in the EDPs under study
in strong agreement with related CA adsorption studies.53 The addition of P4VP-b-PEO
drastically enhances the adsorption capacity of the membrane likely
due to the expected π–π interactions of the benzoyl
groups, which increase in adsorptivity as the benzene rings in the
EDPs become chemically deactivated. Figure S3 shows that a higher concentration of P4VP-b-PEO
leads to higher adsorption. A directly proportional correlation can
be found between adsorption efficiency and contaminant electron deficiency.
This correlation can be due to both increased surface area of the
CA support due to the pores and the π–π interactions
between the block copolymer and positively charged regions of the
EDPs, which supports the idea that the composite membrane is more
likely to promote electrostatic interactions with EDPs at increasing
electron deficiency. Figure 5b depicts the correlation between pharmaceutical absorptivity
and electron deficiency.

Figure 5 (a) Bar plot of the adsorption capacities of
the CA membrane and
the composite membrane and (b) representative figure of the adsorption
trend from greatest to least ED: OMZ degradation intermediates (OMZ
DIs), OMZ, SMX, and SDZ.

The adsorptive trend of the pharmaceuticals with
the composite
membrane can be explained by a combination of the electron deficiency
of each molecule as well as the spatial orientation of the relatively
positive aromatic rings. For the OMZ DIs, the electron density maps
shown in Figure S1 display the positively
charged atoms throughout the cleaved OMZ molecules, inducing the highest
observed electron deficiency in this study: this allows the pyridine
ring in P4VP-b-PEO to easily adsorb the degradation
intermediates. In the case of OMZ, the sulfonamide group hosts a double
bond between sulfur and oxygen. This arrangement leads to a strong
electron-withdrawing effect that can be seen on the electron density
maps in Figure 2, which
provides an interaction site for the pyridine ring from P4VP-b-PEO. In the case of SMX and SDZ, the spatial arrangement
effect is crucial to the difference in membrane adsorption values
of each membrane since both of these groups display similar electronic
characters. Both SMX and SDZ are fitted with a primary nitrogen and
a sulfonamide group on the aromatic ring of interest. However, the
spatial arrangement of the aromatic rings in SMX can be described
as the rings being in intercepting planes. This allows for the pyridine
ring of P4VP-b-PEO to interact freely with the ring
of interest since the spatial orientation allows for the electron-deficient
ring to be isolated in space. On the other hand, SDZ has two rings
bent in space with a vertex at the sulfonamide. The spatial arrangement
that the molecule assumes creates a relatively narrow angle in which
the pyridine ring from P4VP-b-PEO cannot interact
freely with the electron-deficient ring in the plane that faces away
from the sulfonamide group.

In order to determine the maximum
adsorption capacity at the tested
concentration (30 ppm), kinetic experiments were carried out for each
of the pharmaceuticals. As demonstrated in Figure 6a, the hierarchy of adsorption from the single-point
experiments (4 h) is also observed at longer times (24 h). Most notably,
OMZ has not reached equilibrium at 24 h. This can be due to the ED
degradation intermediate species that are generated as the experiment
progresses.45

Figure 6 (a) Adsorption capacity
of CA/P4VP-b-PEO as a
function of contact time from 1–1500 min and (b) CA/P4VP-b-PEO membrane reusability for cycles 2–5 for each
pharmaceutical compound tested.

These statements are supported by Figures S4 and S5, which encompass preliminary isotherm and thorough kinetic
characterization for the composite membrane in EDP solution.

The reusability is an important feature, specifically because it
can reduce costs for the final application while increasing the operational
life of the material. Herein, we test the reusability of the composite
membrane for 5 cycles with each of the EDPs. Interestingly, after
the initial cleaning cycle, all the adsorption values slightly increased
(see Figure S6). This increment can be
attributed to interactions between EtOH and either the ethylene oxide
chains or the hydroxyl groups of the CA. Thereafter, the results were
consistent for 4 cycles (see Figure 6b). This consistency confirms that the material is
efficient after continuous usage, and it suggests that cleaning the
membranes with EtOH optimizes the adsorption capacity of the composite
membrane.

The presented results encompass a thorough characterization
of
the membrane’s composition as well as a demonstration of the
adsorptive trend displayed by the composite membrane and the pharmaceuticals
under study.

4 Conclusions
The study reveals that
the composite membrane is capable of adsorbing
electron-deficient contaminants from aqueous media at low concentrations
with a higher efficiency than the unmodified CA membrane. Most importantly,
the composite membrane demonstrates an affinity toward adsorbing EDPs
at increasing electron deficiency taking into consideration their
spatial arrangement and relative electron deficiency. Although other
materials show a higher adsorption capacity for aqueous contaminants,
this membrane presents our preliminary work in eco-friendly membranes
fabricated for adsorption of specific electron-deficient molecules,
mainly pharmaceuticals, that present alarming and unprecedented threats
in ecosystems and human life. Future works include exploring supports
other than CA and more inexpensive additives than block copolymers.
