The electrochemical
alloying of lead-based electrodes with potassium
was investigated by galvanostatic measurements as well as by ex situ
and operando X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical reduction must
be activated by an initial high current pulse which prevents the passivation
of the lead electrode. The alloying process leads to the formation
of crystalline KPb. During the discharge, two intermediate phases
are observed, K10Pb48 and K4Pb9, whereas only K4Pb9 seems to form during
the charge. High capacity retention is observed, with, however, a
limited specific capacity value because of high weight of lead.

Introduction
The lithium-ion technology
was originally developed to power portable
electronic devices. However, it is now expanding to a growing market
of electric vehicles and stationary storage devices. The considerable
need for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) will continue to rise in the
future and might be confronted with sustainability issues.1 Indeed, it is still doubtful whether the global
lithium reserves can meet the demand, whereas the availability of
cobalt might impact the production of high-energy-density systems.2 It is therefore important to investigate alternative
electrochemical storage systems that could compete with the lithium-ion
technology for some specific applications in the future. In this context,
potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) have recently emerged as a possible
alternative.3,4

The interest in KIBs compared
to commercial LIBs or the emerging
sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) is connected to (i) the high abundance
and homogeneous distribution of potassium, which makes it inexpensive
and less sensitive to price fluctuation, (ii) the low redox potential
of the K+/K redox couple in nonaqueous electrolytes, paving
the way to high-energy-density systems with cell voltages significantly
higher than in NIBs, and (iii) the elevated conductivities of electrolytes
for KIBs owing to the small size of the solvated potassium ion. Moreover,
fast diffusion kinetics are also expected because of the low desolvation
energy of K+.5

The search
for competitive negative or positive electrode materials,
as well as for efficient electrolytes, is logically inspired by past
results about LIBs and NIBs. The relatively large ionic size of potassium
ions is a key parameter that limits the investigation of positive
electrode materials such as layered oxides or polyanionic compounds.6−9 Organic materials have been also tested but they still exhibit too
low working potentials.10 So far, Prussian
blue analogs are leading the race of energy density.11−14 They are also of interest regarding sustainability and low-cost
preparation.

On the opposite side, graphite and other types
of carbons are now
extensively investigated as negative electrode materials.15−18 Unlike Na+, K+ can intercalate into graphite
to form stage-I KC8 with a corresponding specific capacity
close to the theoretical value of 279 mA h/g.16 However, a poor capacity retention upon cycling is observed and
mainly attributed to the large volumetric expansion (+60%).18 At this point, it is worth mentioning that concentrated
effort is mandatory in order to establish both efficient electrode
and electrolyte formulations especially for a better control of the
solid–electrolyte interphase.

Beyond that, alloying electrode
materials are known to offer significantly
higher capacities in LIBs and NIBs. In a similar way, the electrochemical
behaviors of several p-block elements have been recently evaluated
in KIBs.19Figure 1 presents the theoretical gravimetric and
volumetric capacities of elements from groups 14 and 15 versus potassium.
Antimony and bismuth can alloy with three potassiums, leading to relatively
high volumetric capacities, whereas silicon, germanium tin, and lead
react with only one potassium. The activity of phosphorus seems difficult
to trigger and there is still controversy regarding the end product
of the electrochemical alloying. Although the formation of K3P was initially proposed in the study of Sn4P3, recent works suggested a single-electron mechanism and the formation
of KP alloy at the end of the electrochemical discharge, corresponding
to a high specific capacity of 843 mA h/g.20−23

Figure 1 Theoretical gravimetric and volumetric
capacities of elements from
groups 14 and 15. For Si and Ge, the alloy formation was only theoretically
demonstrated.

In 2015, a Sb/C nanocomposite
with a high capacity of 650 mA h/g(Sb) was reported. In
this case, the buffering action of carbon
apparently compensates the dramatic volumetric expansion because of
the formation of K3Sb. When the capacity is artificially
limited to 250 mA h/g(Sb), the alloying is restricted to
the formation of KSb and a better cycling is observed.24 More recently, Han et al. obtained a stable
capacity of 460 mA h/g(Sb+C) after 15 cycles with a composite
electrode made of Sb nanoparticles confined in a three-dimensional
carbon network at the current density of 200 mA/g(Sb+C).25 The operando X-ray diffraction (XRD)
showed a two-step process with first the formation of an amorphous
KxSb phase followed by the formation of
K3Sb at the end of the discharge. Also, bismuth was studied
as a possible negative electrode material for KIBs. In situ XRD evidenced
that the potassiation of Bi proceeds via the successive formation
of the crystalline compounds KBi2, K3Bi2, and finally K3Bi.26 The use of potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) salt instead
of potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6) and glyme-based
solvents instead of carbonate-based solvents allows improving the
performance of Bi electrodes.27,28 Regarding tin-based
electrodes, a limited capacity below 200 mA h/g was obtained with
a ball-milled Sn–C nanocomposite, and the electrochemical mechanism
shows the final formation of KSn.29−31

Because of its
weight and toxicity, lead has been put aside as
negative electrode material in rechargeable LIBs and NIBs for many
years. This is unfortunate as high theoretical capacities are expected
for the formation of Li22Pb5 (568 mA h/g) or
Na15Pb4 (485 mA h/g). Moreover, lead is inexpensive
and its extensive use for lead-acid batteries clearly shows that the
risks related to the toxicity might be lowered through appropriate
safe packaging. The very high recycling rate of 99% is also an important
point in terms of cost.32 The reaction
mechanism of lead with sodium was studied by in situ XRD, showing
a four-step process from Pb to Na15Pb4. A poor
capacity was obtained with a conventional carbonate solvent electrolyte
even using a limited potential window.33 By using a glyme-based electrolyte and a specific electrode formulation,
Darwiche et al. obtained a capacity of 460 mA h/g after 50 cycles
at a C/5 rate with an excellent coulombic efficiency.34 Lead was also recently investigated as a negative electrode
material for magnesium-ion batteries by Obrovac and co-workers.35 Sputtered Pb films exhibited reversible capacity
of 450 mA h/g, corresponding to the formation of Mg2Pb.
Pb anodes were reported in potassium-based dual-ion batteries with
expanded graphite cathodes. The battery presented a weaker cycling
stability than with Sn anodes, and therefore the reaction mechanism
was not studied in detail.36

In this
work, lead is considered as another potential negative
electrode material for KIBs. According to the thermodynamic K–Pb
phase diagram, the electrochemical alloying of Pb with K leads to
the full potassiated KPb phase, with gravimetric and volumetric capacities
of 129 mA h/g and 580 mA h/cm3, respectively. Three intermediates
phases, K2Pb3, KPb2, and KPb4, are also mentioned and could be formed during the electrochemical
reaction. Although the theoretical capacity is limited, this work
joins the general frame of investigating alternative negative electrode material for next
efficient and sustainable KIBs.

Results and Discussion
A first series of electrochemical tests of Pb electrodes cycled
at C/5 in KFSI in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethylene carbonate (DEC)
(1:1) shows galvanostatic profiles with an irregular voltage plateau
around 1.3 V and a very limited reversible capacity (Figure S1). This phenomenon has been already observed in other
electrochemical systems with alloying-type electrode materials. Dahn
et al. observed an irreversible voltage plateau at 1.0 V for SnO cycled
versus Li+/Li and suggested the formation of cracks caused
by volume expansion.37 This phenomenon
was also described by Tamura et al. for electrodeposited Sn cycled
versus Li+/Li and by Beattie et al. who observed an anomalous
irreversible voltage plateau around 1.5 V for electroplated and sputtered
Sn electrodes.38,39 Obrovac and co-workers recently
attributed this phenomenon to catalytic surface reactions of tin or
lead with the electrolytes that hinder the alloying process, and proposed
to bypass it by applying an initial strong current pulse.33,35

Following the latter strategy, a second series of electrochemical
tests was attempted by first applying a current of 1 mA until
the potential reaches 0.8 V. The resulting cycling curves are strongly
modified (Figure 2).
During the first discharge at C/5, the potential decreases quickly
from 0.8 to 0.4 V; a slope change is observed with a plateau at 0.3
V before a sloped end with a total capacity of 157 mA h/g(Pb+C). The early moments of the subsequent charge show a similar sloped
tail, before reaching two successive very stable voltage plateaus
at 0.65 and 0.72 V. This sequence of processes is maintained during
few cycles in discharge as well as in charge, producing a reversible
capacity of 105 mA h/g(Pb+C). Increasing the potential
cut-off value above 0.8 V triggers again the parasitic reaction and
strongly alters the reversible capacity (Figure S2).

Figure 2 Voltage profile of the Pb electrode cycled between 0.0 and 0.8
V at C/5. Insets show the ex situ XRD patterns collected at the end
of the first discharge (bottom, with residue of remaining Pb) and
at the end of the first charge (top, with PbO as minor impurity).

In order to clarify the overall
electrochemical mechanism, XRD
patterns were collected ex situ at different stages. At the end of
the discharge, crystalline KPb is evidenced with residual unreacted
Pb (inset of Figure 2). Indeed, the XRD pattern can be indexed using the tetragonal space
group I41/acd with refined
cell parameters (a = 11.531(1) Å and c = 18.855(1) Å) in good agreement with the literature.40 The final formation of KPb also agrees with
the K–Pb thermodynamic phase diagram where KPb appears as the
K-richest alloy. During the first discharge, the potassiation of the
lead-based electrode is accompanied by (i) a significant electrochemical
activity of the carbon additives toward potassium ions (Figure S3) and (ii) the likely formation of a
solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) coming from electrolyte decomposition.
Further investigations are ongoing in order to better understand the
structure and the composition of the electrode/electrolyte interphase
for both Pb and carbon additives, as well as its impact on capacity
and capacity retention. At the end of charge, crystalline Pb is recovered
(inset of Figure 2)
with cell parameters similar to pristine Pb. A small amount of PbO
is also detected, most probably formed during electrode washing prior
to the XRD measurement.

In order to better understand the complex
electrochemical signature
of Pb versus K and identify the phases formed during the reaction,
operando XRD was carried out after a first activation cycle (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Operando XRD measurement
of the Pb electrode during potassiation/depotassiation
(left) with the corresponding voltage profile plotted as a function
of time (right). Black and red patterns link to the discharge and
the charge, respectively. Specific patterns in thicker lines are isolated
in Figure 4 for better
characterization.

As soon as the discharge
progresses, diffraction peaks (111) and
(200) of initial Pb (see Figure S4) decrease
quickly, whereas new peaks appear at 17.5°, 28.9°, 30.7°,
and 34°. The XRD pattern recorded at the end of the first potential
plateau can be attributed to K10Pb48, which
crystallizes in the cubic space group I4̅3m [inorganic crystal structure database (ICSD) no. 410090] (Figure 4a).41 On continuing the discharge process, the intensity of the peaks
from K10Pb48 decreases rapidly and the following
patterns recorded during the second plateau show ill-defined diffraction
peaks at 11.9°, 13.2°, and 26.7°. At this moment, based
on the stoichiometry of the reacted potassium, two different phases
are possible: KPb2 (space group P63/mmc, ICSD no. 104613) or K4Pb9 (space group P121/m1, ICSD no. 240029).42,43 The pattern recorded at the end
of the second plateau was thus isolated for deeper characterization:
the set of new peaks matches well with K4Pb9, whereas the most intense peaks of KPb2 are absent (Figure 4b). The final step
of the discharge leads to the formation of crystalline KPb (Figure 4c). The (111) reflection
of Pb is still visible during the whole discharge, in agreement with
the ex situ XRD (inset of Figure 2), which attests the only partial reaction of pristine
Pb particles.

Figure 4 Specific XRD patterns recorded during the operando measurement
(a) at the end of the first plateau (blue circle in Figure 3), (b) at the end of the second
plateau (green circle in Figure 3), and (c) at the end of the overall discharge (black
circle in Figure 3).
The normalized volume evolution (d) illustrates the important alloying
expansion. (e) Scheme of the potassiation/depotassiation of the lead
electrode.

The following charge presents
two voltage plateaus, which correspond
to the transitions of KPb to K4Pb9 and from
K4Pb9 directly to Pb. The overall potassiation
from Pb to KPb involves an important volumetric expansion (+259%),
which is logically larger than during the electrochemical formation
of LiPb (+146%) and NaPb (+205%) (Figure 4d).

The alloying and de-alloying process
of lead electrodes with potassium
is schematically resumed in Figure 4e. To summarize, during the discharge (alloying) the
potassiation of lead goes through two intermediate phases K10Pb48 and K4Pb9 before the formation
of KPb at the end of the discharge. Upon charge, only one intermediate
is observed, K4Pb9, whereas no trace of K10Pb48 is visible before the recovering of Pb metal.
Interestingly, this mechanism differs from that calculated by the
group of Ceder who mentioned a three-step process with KPb2 as one of the intermediates.4 The phases
mentioned in the phase diagram do not seem to form, whereas the two
intermediates identified by operando XRD are supposed to form only
at high temperatures. This is not surprising, as the thermodynamic
phase diagram is not always respected during electrochemical alloying
(as previously observed in the case of Sb with sodium44,45), and in some cases, electrochemical reactions can lead to the formation
of phases that are expected to form at high pressure and/or high temperature
(as for NiSb2 with Li46).

The cycling performance of the Pb/K cell at a C/5 rate is presented
in Figure 5a. The first
cycle presents a low coulombic efficiency of 68%, likely because of
the formation of an SEI and the electrochemical activity of carbon
included in the electrode formulation (Figure S3). The reversible charge capacity progressively decreases
from 108 mA h/g (485 mA h/cm3) to 75 mA h/g (335 mA h/cm3) after 20 cycles. The capacity significantly decreases when
the current rate is increased from C/10 to C/2 (Figure 5b).

capacity (squares) and coulombic efficiency (triangle) at the C/5
rate and (b) first cycle at different current rates from C/10 to C/2.

Conclusions
The electrochemical
potassiation of lead was investigated for the
first time using specific cycling conditions in terms of current and
potential window to prevent the passivation of the lead electrode
at high potential. The galvanostatic profile showed three distinct
steps during the discharge and only two during charge. The reaction
mechanism revealed by operando XRD involves the formation of K10Pb48, K4Pb9, and KPb during
the discharge, whereas only K4Pb9 is formed
on going from KPb to Pb. The reversible potassiation of lead is obtained
for several cycles at the C/5 rate. This investigation confirms the
interest in alloying-type materials for the development of rechargeable
KIBs.

Experimental Section
Micrometric lead powder from Sigma-Aldrich
(99.95%, ∼325
mesh) was used as the active material. Electrode formulation was carried
out under argon atmosphere by mixing the metallic powder (70 wt %)
with carbon additives (9 wt % of Timcal C-Nergy Super C65, 9 wt %
of vapor-grown carbon fibers) and a polymeric binder (12 wt % of polyvinylidene
difluoride, Solef 5130 from Solvay). A slurry with anhydrous N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (99.5% from Sigma-Aldrich) as solvent
was homogeneously mixed by a planetary ball-milling (1 h), then tape-casted
at 150 μm on a thick copper foil, and finally dried for a few
days at room temperature. The resulting film was finally dried overnight
at 80 °C under dynamic vacuum. The final mass loading of the
electrodes varied from 2.0 to 2.5 mg/cm2.

Standard
coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox
with a counter electrode of potassium metal (Sigma-Aldrich) and a
glass fiber separator (Whatman, GF/D) soaked with an electrolyte made
of KFSI salt (from Solvionic) dissolved in a 1:1 volumetric mixture
of EC/DEC (0.8 mol/L of salt concentration).

The electrochemical
tests were performed in galvanostatic mode
at room temperature using a research-grade potentiostat (MPG-2, BioLogic).
Current rates ranged from C/10 to C/2 (C/n meaning
1 mol of K per mol of Pb in n hours). The capacities
are presented in mA h/g of composite (Pb + C) in order to take into
account the activity of carbon from the formulation. For the ex situ
XRD measurements after cycling, coin cells were disassembled under
argon atmosphere in a glovebox, and the electrodes were washed twice
with 1 mL of DEC and then detached from the current collectors.

In order to reveal the electrochemical mechanism, an operando XRD
analysis was carried out using a dedicated electrochemical cell equipped
with a beryllium window. Here, the above described electrode slurry
was tape-casted onto a very thin aluminum foil (thickness 2 μm).
XRD patterns were continuously collected on an Empyrean 2 theta/omega
diffractometer (PANalytical) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (10°–37°
2θ range for an acquisition time of 1 h).
