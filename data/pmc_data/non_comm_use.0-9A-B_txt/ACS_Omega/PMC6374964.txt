Cr(III)
is often regarded as a trace essential micronutrient that
can be found in many dietary supplements due to its participation
in blood glucose regulation. However, increased levels of exposure
have been linked to adverse health effects in living organisms. Herein,
scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was used to detect variation
in membrane permeability of single cells (T24) resulting from exposure
to a trivalent Cr-salt, CrCl3. By employing electrochemical
mediators, ferrocenemethanol (FcMeOH) and ferrocenecarboxylic acid
(FcCOO–), initially semipermeable and impermeable,
respectively, complementary information was obtained. Three-dimensional
COMSOL finite element analysis simulations were successfully used
to quantify the permeability coefficients of each mediator by matching
experimental and simulated results. Depending on the concentration
of Cr(III) administered, three regions of membrane response were detected.
Following exposure to low concentrations (up to 500 μM Cr(III)),
their permeability coefficients were comparable to that of control
cells, 80 μm/s for FcMeOH and 0 μm/s for FcCOO–. This was confirmed for both mediators. As the incubation concentrations
were increased, the ability of FcMeOH to permeate the membrane decreased
to a minimum of 17 μm/s at 7500 μM Cr(III), while FcCOO– remained impermeable. At the highest examined concentrations,
both mediators were found to demonstrate increased membrane permeability.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell
viability studies were also conducted on Cr(III)-treated T24 cells
to correlate the SECM findings with the toxicity effects of the metal.
The viability experiments revealed a similar concentration-dependent
trend to the SECM cell membrane permeability study.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Many
heavy metal ions, such as cadmium and arsenic, have toxic
properties, leading to detrimental effects in living organisms.1 By contrast, metals such as zinc, iron, and calcium,
take part in biological systems and are required for healthy growth
and development of an organism. These trace essential heavy metals
are necessary in small quantities but become toxic at higher concentrations.2 The toxicity of metals in the body can also be
dependent on the metal oxidation state. For example, Cr(III) is regarded
as an essential micronutrient that is often found in many dietary
supplements to promote cellular homeostasis.3−5 This is due
to its involvement with low-molecular-weight chromium-binding-substance
that maintains the active conformation of the insulin receptor, important
for blood glucose regulation. However, high concentrations of Cr(III)
exposure can lead to toxicity.6−8 On the other hand, Cr(VI) is known
to induce oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, and carcinogenicity, regardless
of its concentration.6,7,9−15

Elevated levels of Cr(III) have been associated with heightened
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).1,5,13,16−19 In some cases, Cr(III) has been shown to lead to higher ROS levels
than the toxic Cr(VI) oxidation state.11 The mechanism of Cr(III) toxicity is believed to involve not only
elevated levels of ROS, but also the direct interaction of Cr(III)
with DNA. The resultant DNA adducts lead to genomic instability.6 However, Cr(III) does not easily cross the cell
membrane and is commonly brought into the cell by active means such
as pinocytosis, reducing its toxic effects.20,21

Cr is known to bioaccumulate primarily in the kidneys, liver,
and
lungs of mammals, potentially leading to adverse health effects in
these tissues as concentrations increase.13,22−24 Monitoring exposure to Cr, commonly through urine
content, has determined a substantial half-life of ∼10 years
in the body.22,24 Due to its ability to bioaccumulate
in the urinary tract and its potential to cause cellular damage, our
current study focuses on T24 cells and human urinary bladder carcinoma.

In molecular biochemistry and biology, there are many research
tools. For instance, ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) signaling
and redox reactions can be investigated via fluorescence spectroscopy
and electrochemistry.25−29 However, many techniques focus on bulk analysis of cell samples.
This provides an excellent indication of population traits; single
cell techniques are needed to examine sample heterogeneity. Single
live-cell studies are challenging. Since bioanalytical tools such
as spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and flow cytometry can provide
information on a series of individual cells, such as ROS release,
events that are linked to a specific area of a live cell are tough
to assess. Neither can these tools analyze chemical activity on an
individual spot of interest over a cell membrane.

Scanning electrochemical
microscopy (SECM) is a viable method of
studying biological samples while leaving their homeostasis unaltered
and has been successfully employed in numerous cellular studies. SECM
provides a method of single cell characterization and can be utilized
for location specific analysis of the cell membrane, limited only
by the diameter of the electrode. This technique has proven useful
for a range of investigations involving reaction kinetics,30 surface and interface processes,31,32 microstructure fabrication,33,34 cellular imaging,35,36 membrane transport,37−41 multidrug resistance,42,43 nerve cell signaling,44 cellular ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS),36,45−49 metabolic interactions,18 and cellular
redox processes.50−56 Furthermore, SECM can be used for the rapid quantification of single
live cell topography and surface reactivity.

These dynamic cellular
processes can be interpreted from variations
in the faradic current at the ultramicroelectrode (UME) as it approaches
the cell from above. This type of analysis is commonly performed in
feedback mode, with the addition of a nontoxic electrochemical mediator.57,58 At small probe-to-cell distances, the membrane permeability can
affect the tip current. In proximity to the membrane, the availability
of the mediator from the bulk solution to the UME becomes hindered.
This hindered diffusion causes a decrease in current termed as negative
feedback. However, if the mediator is permeable to the cellular membrane,
it may cross the membrane and reach the UME tip. This has an effect
of weakening the negative feedback that would be observed when compared
to an impermeable membrane of the same geometry. The resultant data
are commonly reported as probe approach curves (PACs), displaying
the normalized current as a function of normalized distance to the
membrane.

Since it is known that a correlation between membrane
permeability
and cellular viability/activity exists,59,60 here, SECM
was used to explore the membrane responses of T24 cell exposure to
trivalent CrCl3. Operating in the depth scan mode, the
UME is scanned in a two-dimensional (2D) x–z plane above the cell, generating a 2D current map consisting
of hundreds of individual PACs. Then, three-dimensional (3D) COMSOL
finite element analysis simulations were utilized to generate theoretical
depth scan images. Through the comparison of theoretical and experimental
data, permeability coefficients were extracted. Very interestingly,
membrane permeability on a specific spot of interest can be determined
very straightforward, and membrane permeability mapping above an area
over a live cell can be obtained easily.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Off-Axis Characterization
of Cell Membrane
Permeability
SECM depth scanning moves the UME in the x–z plane of solution over a single
live cell. This generates a 2D electrochemical map of the region of
space over the cell. Cross sections can be taken of theoretical and
experimental (Figure 1A) depth scans to produce more conventional PACs. Depth scan images
are comprised of hundreds of PACs at different locations over the
cell surface. To analyze experimental PACs taken at positions displaced
from the cell center requires full 3D simulations, as the symmetry
axis required for the more common 2D axially symmetric method cannot
be maintained.61,62 The experimental PACs extracted
at these locations can be overlaid on the theoretical ones to obtain
quantitative characterization of membrane permeability (Figure 1B–D). Figure 3A illustrates the membrane
permeability map of a T24 cell after 1 h incubation with 250 μM
Cr(III). PACs over the cell surface were extracted from the depth
scan images at three locations represented by the red, green, and
blue planes. These curves were overlaid onto theoretical PACs simulated
at the same physical UME positions. With a 10 μm diameter Pt
UME, the membrane permeability to ferrocenemethanol (FcMeOH) across
the whole cell surface was determined to be uniform at 75 μm/s.

and theoretical PACs corresponding to extraction planes seen in (A),

2.2 Quantification
of Change in Permeability to
the Electrochemical Mediator FcMeOH
The electrochemical mediator
FcMeOH has been shown to be partially permeable to T24 cell membranes
under untreated (control) conditions. The changes in membrane permeability
can provide insights into the biological effects induced by exposure
to external stressors.40,63,64 Experimental PACs to the untreated T24 cells had an average membrane
permeability coefficient of 80 ± 6 μm/s.

After 1
h Cr(III) treatment between 0 and 500 μM, the membrane permeability
and morphology of the T24 cells remained unaffected relative to the
control sample (approximately 80 μm/s) (Figure 2A). This membrane stability region is a result
of the essential role of intracellular Cr(III). At these concentrations,
it appears that T24 cells are capable of utilizing the additional
Cr(III) for internal chemical processes.

and theoretical PACs for quantification
of cell membrane permeability coefficients with the electrochemical
mediator FcMeOH. Incubation with various concentrations of CrCl3 displays regions of (A) stable, (B) decreasing, and (C) increasing
membrane permeability. (D) Representation of the membrane permeability
change illustrating the three regions of (a) stable, (b) decreasing,
and (c) increasing permeability.

After exposure to 750–7500 μM Cr(III), a decreasing
trend in permeability becomes evident (Figure 2B). The initial decrease observed in the
750 μM samples corresponded to a permeability coefficient of
60 ± 13 μm/s. This was followed by a decrease in P values to 58 ± 8 and 50 ± 9 μm/s after
exposure to 1000 and 2500 μM Cr(III), respectively. Even more
significant P decreases occurred with incubation
concentrations of 5000 and 7500 μM, showing average P values of 31 ± 6 and 17 ± 8 μm/s, respectively.
This decrease may be attributed to the overwhelming of antioxidant
defense systems since Cr(III) toxicity can lead to increased ROS generation,
followed by lipid peroxidation.6 Lipid
peroxidation is known to affect changes in the bilayer thickness and
membrane fluidity65 and is a likely mechanism
by which membrane characteristics are altered.

After exposure
to 10 000 μM Cr(III), relaxation in P occurs, returning to 83 ± 8 μm/s (Figure 2C). This relaxation
resulted in the membrane permeability coefficient that is similar
to the control samples (80 ± 6 μm/s). At this concentration,
Cr(III) likely surpasses the trace essential requirements and becomes
toxic. The resulting ROS production overwhelms the cellular defense
systems, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase,
leading to oxidative damage and increased cell membrane damage.

Note that a complete data set (N > 4 cells) was
obtained for each Cr(III) incubation concentration (example curves
are shown in Figure 2A–C) and was used to determine its average ± standard
error membrane permeability coefficients, which is summarized in Figure 2D. Three distinct
regions of membrane response were observed when FcMeOH serves as the
SECM mediator. Lower concentrations exhibited relative stability in
membrane response with incubation concentrations below 50 μM
(region a). Incubation of cells with 50–500 μM Cr(III)
resulted in deviation from the previously observed membrane stability,
and a decrease in permeability coefficient (region b). Higher concentrations,
exceeding 500 μM Cr(III), (750 and 1000 μM) caused the
permeability coefficient to increase, and return to a permeability
coefficient value similar to the control (region c).

2.3 Cell Membrane Permeability to the Electrochemical
Mediator FcCOO–
Under control conditions,
SECM revealed that the membrane permeability coefficient to ferrocenecarboxylate
(FcCOO–) was 0 μm/s (membrane impermeable).
This was expected due to the charged nature of the mediator at pH
7.4. The membrane permeability remained relatively stable around 0
μm/s after Cr(III) treatments less than 7500 μM (50–5000
μM, Figure 3A). Minor increases were observed after 100,
750, and 1000 μM treatments, showing average ± standard
error membrane permeability coefficients of 29 ± 17, 25 ±
21, and 37 ± 18 μm/s, respectively. Due to the more hydrophilic
and charged nature of the FcCOO– mediator, it is
unable to cross the hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid bilayer
(cell membrane). As a result, FcCOO– is largely
impermeable to the cell membrane under normal (control) conditions.63 These results were in agreement with the SECM
results previously described, as FcMeOH is partially permeable in
nature, the decrease in membrane permeability trend is observable
by FcMeOH but not observable by FcCOO–. FcCOO–, however, allows for more accurate imaging of cell
topography since it is largely independent of membrane permeability
under control conditions. The use of impermeable redox mediators when
performing SECM on biological samples can indicate significant disruption
in normal cell membrane performance.63,66 Therefore,
the use of FcCOO– as the SECM mediator can provide
good indication of when Cr(III) no longer behaves as a trace essential
metal, but rather as a toxin.

Figure 3 Overlap of experimental and theoretical PACs
with FcCOOH as a mediator,
displaying regions of (A) stable and (B) increasing membrane permeability
following CrCl3 incubation. (C) A representation of the
membrane permeability change is also provided, showing the (a) stable
and (c) increasing permeability.

After T24 cells were treated with 7500–10 000
μM
Cr(III), a trend of increasing permeability to FcCOO– was observed (Figure 3B), which was similar to the trend determined with FcMeOH (Figure 2D). When incubated
with 7500 μM Cr(III), the cell membrane permeability coefficient
increased to 19 ± 16 μm/s. The highest concentration sample
(10 000 μM Cr(III)) was observed to induce a membrane
permeability coefficient of 260 ± 53 μm/s. This confirms
a concentration-dependent effect of Cr(III) on membrane permeability
in T24 cells. We suspect, over longer exposure to Cr(III), that this
may result in the selection of T24 cells with genetic mutations that
offer greater resistance to Cr(III) poisoning. This permeability increase
is likely attributed to the overwhelming of antioxidant defense systems
as previously discussed. The effects of high Cr(III) concentration
on the cell membrane were similar to that seen with the FcMeOH mediator.
This confirms significant oxidative cell membrane damage, such that
polar compounds (FcCOO–) are capable of entering
the cell. In particular, lipid peroxidation is known to drastically
change the membrane characteristics by increasing the number of polar
functional groups within the internal membrane region.65,67

The membrane permeability trend for FcCOO– was
found to agree with those previously discussed for FcMeOH. Figure 3C shows the initial
permeability coefficient to be 0 μm/s for FcCOO–. A trend of stability is observed (region a) at all concentrations
occupied by regions a and b in the FcMeOH trend (Figure 2D). A concentration of 7500
μM Cr(III) appears to be the onset concentration at which T24
cells become permeable to FcCOO–. The permeability
to FcCOO– significantly increases following this
concentration (region c), similar to that observed with FcMeOH.

A direct comparison of Figure 2D with Figure 3C also shows the apparent similarities in membrane responses
following excessive CrCl3 exposure. Examination of the
Cr(III) concentrations at which the membrane response is triggered
in SECM can be used to judge relative toxicities.

2.4 Viability Study of T24 Cells Incubated with
CrCl3
Since changes in permeability were found
to be dependent on concentration, the overall health of the Cr(III)-treated
T24 cells was also considered. Here, cellular health was investigated
by employing the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay, routinely used to measure cellular viability
of a bulk population of live cells (Figure 4). Cell viability is represented as the mean
± standard error of four separate experiments (four to eight
replications per experiment). Similar to the SECM studies, the T24
cells were exposed to various Cr(III) concentrations for 1 h. These
samples were compared to control cells, taken from the same culture
(eq 1). 1  Cells
exposed to concentrations below 500
μM showed viability with minimal deviation from the control
group, approximately 100%. Exposure concentrations exceeding 500 μM
resulted in gradual decreased viability. The decrease in cell viability
was found to continue with increasing exposure concentrations. This
confirms the increase in Cr(III)-induced cellular death in T24 cells
with higher Cr(III) concentrations. This observation follows the SECM
studies well, as exposure to Cr(III) concentrations greater than 500 μM
induced significant membrane permeability changes. The internal disruptions
in cell homeostasis, which lead to cell death, likely contribute to
the changes in the membrane that increase the membrane permeability
coefficients in SECM.

a range
of Cr(III) concentrations for 1 h, between 0 and 10 000 μM.

3 Conclusions
Using two separate mediators, the impact of Cr(III) exposure on
membrane permeability was successfully interrogated by SECM. Full
3D simulations were computed, allowing for the accurate quantification
of cell membrane permeability at any position across the cell membrane.
Through the comparison of experimentally and theoretically acquired
PACs, changes in membrane permeability coefficients were discovered
and quantified. With the membrane permeable FcMeOH, SECM revealed
that T24 cells exhibit Cr(III) concentration-dependent effects on
their membrane response. Incubation with low Cr(III) concentrations
showed little effect on the membrane permeability coefficients. Permeability
to FcMeOH was observed to be maintained around 80 μm/s when
incubated with 500 μM Cr(III) or less, which was similar to
that of the control cell permeability. Increasing the exposure level
resulted in decreased permeability coefficients until a minimum of
17 ± 8 μm/s was observed at 7500 μM Cr(III). Ultimately
with higher (more acute) Cr(III) exposure, the membrane permeability
was discovered to increase, returning to and exceeding the permeability
coefficient value seen in control cells. The electrochemical mediator
FcCOO–, in contrast to FcMeOH, is impermeable to
cell membranes. FcCOO– revealed only two concentration-dependent
trends. Initially, the membrane permeability was found to remain unchanged,
with permeability coefficients near 0 μm/s, until treated with
high concentrations (more acute dosage) of Cr(III). Both FcMeOH and
FcCOO– mediators exhibited a strong increase in membrane permeability
coefficients when subjected to similar concentrations (7500 μM
CrCl3 for 1 h). These experiments show the strong effectiveness
of SECM in providing insights into cell membrane integrity.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Ferrocenemethanol
(FcMeOH,
97%), ferrocenecarboxylic acid (FcCOOH, 97%), potassium chloride (KCl,
99%), and chromium chloride hexahydrate (CrCl3·6H2O, 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Mississauga, ON).
Mediator solutions containing 0.9 mM FcMeOH with 0.1 M KCl were regularly
prepared in deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm). The FcMeOH solution
is diluted to half concentration with 1× phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) when used experimentally. A FcCOOH stock solution of 0.5 mM
was prepared in PBS. At pH 7.4, FcCOOH dissociates into FcCOO– in solution. Stock solutions of 0.5 M CrCl3 were prepared in autoclaved deionized water and syringe filtered
through sterile 0.2 μm Supor Membranes (PALL Life Sciences,
Mississauga, ON). The compound 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) was acquired from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis,
MN) in the TACS MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. Spectroscopic grade
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to dissolve the formazan crystals
(Caledon Laboratory Ltd., Georgetown, ON).

4.2 Cell
Culture
Human urinary bladder
cancer cells (T24 cells (HTB-4)) (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown and
maintained in McCoy’s 5a medium (ATCC) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Experimental data
were acquired using cells within a narrow passage window (45–48)
to provide consistency among data sets.

Cell samples used for
SECM experimentation were grown on uncoated 50 mm glass bottom Petri
dishes (P50G-0-30-F, MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA). An hour prior
to analysis, CrCl3 was injected directly into the growth
media at the desired concentrations and incubated for 1 h. Immediately
before examination, media were removed, and Cr(III)-treated T24 cells
were washed thoroughly with sterile 1× PBS, before the addition
of the mediator solution used for SECM analysis (FcMeOH or FcCOO–).

4.3 Cell Viability
The effects of CrCl3 on cellular viability were assessed
using the MTT cell proliferation
assay.68,69 Briefly, 2 × 104 cells per
well were seeded onto Corning Scientific Costar 96-well polystyrene
flat bottom plates. After 24 h, the growth medium was aspirated and
replaced with new growth medium containing CrCl3. Sodium
dodecyl sulfate (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, or 0.20 mg/mL) was used as a positive
control for the assay.

After incubation for 1 h, the growth
medium was carefully aspirated and replaced with 100 μL of fresh
growth medium (absent of phenol red) and 10 μL of the MTT reagent.
After 6 h, the MTT solution was carefully aspirated and the formazan
crystals were dissolved with 50 μL of spectroscopic grade DMSO.
The absorbance at 540 nm was read by an M1000 PRO plate reader (Tecan,
Switzerland) following 1 s of shaking at 2 mm amp and 654 rpm. To
remove the background media effects, empty (blank) wells were also
treated according to the MTT protocol.

4.4 Instrumentation
and Procedure
A detailed
description of the SECM instrumentation and experimental procedures
can be found elsewhere.61 Briefly, SECM
experiments were carried out using a modified α-SNOM (WITec,
Ulm, Germany). The α-SNOM set-up included a custom UME mount
and a variable temperature Petri dish mount (Bioscience Tools, San
Diego, CA). Optical imaging, and cell and electrode positioning were
assisted by an inverted objective lens (50×, N.A. 0.55, W.D.
10.1 mm, Nikon, Japan) below the Petri dish. The UMEs were fabricated
in-house following a previously developed methodology.37,47,70 Throughout this study, the UME
consisted of a 10 μm Pt wire which was sheathed in insulating
glass, with a ratio of glass to Pt diameter (RG) of approximately
3. Electrochemical instrumentation consisted of a CH Instruments Electrochemical
Analyzer (CHI800B, CH Instruments, Austin, TX) with a CHI200 Picoamp
Booster. An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as a combined counter and reference
electrode. The CHI800B output channel was connected to the WITec α-SNOM
data acquisition channel providing position specific electrochemical
information.

The SECM is operated in feedback mode, where an
electrochemical mediator (FcMeOH or FcCOO– in this
study) is added to the live-cell sample. In the case of both of these,
the mediators are oxidized at the UME tip by a 1e– reaction. Before each experiment, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used
to test for steady-state performance of the UME probe and electrochemical
mediator. Identified through CV, the UME was biased at a probe potential
of 0.3 V for FcMeOH and 0.4 V for FcCOO– for their
respective steady-state oxidative currents (while in bulk solution, Figure S1). To limit the effects of forced convection,
scan speeds did not exceed 21.4 μm/s.71

Following incubation, the culture medium in the Petri dishes
containing
the CrCl3-treated cells was aspirated, and the cells were
washed thoroughly with sterile 1× PBS. The electrochemical mediator
solution was then added (FcMeOH or FcCOO–), and
the dish was secured to the heated stage of the α-SNOM. The
effects FcMeOH and FcCOO– have been investigated
elsewhere and determined to be nontoxic over these experimental timescales.48,51,72 The samples were maintained at
37.0 ± 0.2 °C to mimic physiological conditions for the
cell line. Analysis of live-cell samples was conducted over a maximum
duration of 60 min with individual scans taking 7:10 min. This allows
multiple cells to be acquired from the same dish. No morphological
changes are observed over the short scan time for the acquisition
of the single cell depth scans. After location of a cell, the UME
was then positioned near the cell of interest, followed by imaging
of the cell using the depth scan imaging mode. This allowed for real
time probe-to-cell distance information, reducing the probability
of collisions. Manipulation of depth scan parameters, such as scan
width, depth, image resolution, and integration time, was performed
through the WITec software.

4.5 Simulation
Theoretical
PAC data were
generated using a COMSOL Multiphysics (v5.2) finite element method
model as published elsewhere.37,61,66,73,74 A full 3D model was created to replicate the experimental geometry.
A symmetry plane was present through the center of the UME and cell,
allowing for the simplification of the model (Figure 5). The dimensions of the electrode (platinum
radius of 5 μm and an RG of 3) were used to create the model
of the UME. The average T24 cell size was determined optically (86
cells) to be 26.33 ± 0.62 and 18.23 ± 0.39 μm, in
the long and short axis, respectively. T24 cell height was previously
determined to be 8.7 ± 3.3 μm by SECM.74 This geometry was replicated in the model by a semiellipsoid
with radii y = 13.5 μm, x =
9.0 μm, and z = 8.0 μm as a cell analog.
The simulation model incorporated concentrations of mediator in the
solution domain (CB) and an independent
cell interior domain (CC). Initial concentrations
of these domains were defined as CB_T0 = 0.45 mM and CC_T0 = 0 M for FcMeOH,
or CB_T0 = 0.50 mM and CC_T0 = 0 M for FcCOO–. Mediator flux
across the cell membrane boundary is dependent on the concentration
gradient as well as the permeability coefficient (P) (eqs 2 and 3). 2   3  The diffusion coefficients in both domains
were set to 7.6 × 10–10 and 5.7 × 10–10 m2/s for FcMeOH and FcCOO–, respectively.63,73,75 The simulation was performed in two stages. The first stage allowed
the two domains to reach equilibrium (over 10 min), which provides
an initial concentration distribution for the UME approach. In the
second stage, the electrode position is parameterized over its full
experimental range of motion towards the cell.

Figure 5 (A) Geometry of an SECM
approach to an isolated cell with elements
labeled (i.e., boundaries and domains). (B) Zoom in of the region
between the UME and cell displayed in (A).

In this study, the electrode position is moved in both the x and z axes, as a set of nested parametric
sweeps. This allows the full simulation of depth scans over the cell.
The theoretical depth scans can be treated as a 2D matrix of electrochemical
current values with the UME tip position. One-dimensional PACs and
horizontal sweeps can be extracted from the 2D matrix. This allows
fitting of the experimental PACs or horizontal sweeps. The membrane
permeability coefficients are parametrically simulated, ranging between
0 and 1000 μm/s. Nesting the UME position inside of the permeability
parameterization generates a set of depth scans at these desired permeability
coefficients (Figure 6). Please note that the permeability was assumed to be homogeneous
across the entire cell membrane as we previously found with T24 cells
challenged by Cd(II).61 This point can
be further verified in Section 2.1. A membrane permeability coefficient of 0 μm/s
produces the same depth scan profile as an ideally insulating surface
(no flux) of the same geometry (Figure 6A). Low permeability coefficients restrict the transport
of the electrochemical mediator, causing reduced current in close
proximity to the cell surface (Figure 6B). With an increase in the permeability coefficient,
less negative feedback is observed which leads to a higher electrochemical
current profile (Figure 6C–G). A highly permeable cell membrane (Figure 6H) shows little electrochemical response
from the cell as the mediator is able to move freely in and out of
the cell towards the UME tip.

Figure 6 Simulated depth scans over a single cell with
membrane permeability
coefficients defined as 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 μm/s
are shown in tiles (A)–(H), respectively.
