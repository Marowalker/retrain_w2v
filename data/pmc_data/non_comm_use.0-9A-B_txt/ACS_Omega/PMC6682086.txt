The
cocrystals of sulfamethazine with different acids, namely,
2-mercaptophenylcarboxylic acid, 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, 4-(4-hydroxyphenylazo)phenylcarboxylic
acid, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, and 4-(phenyl)phenylcarboxylic
acid, are studied here. Each has distinct notable supramolecular features.
The pyrimidin-2-amine unit of the sulfamethazine provided unique examples
of cocrystals in which amidine and imidine forms or neutral and protonated
forms of sulfamethazine are observed in 2:2 ratios. Hence, this study
provides avenues to explore cocrystals with tautomeric forms together
in a cocrystal and also neutral and protonated cocrystal partners
as apparent multicomponents in cocrystals. Among the cocrystals, three
of them have the amidine form of the sulfamethazine in respective
self-assembly. The cocrystal of 2-mercapto-phenylcarboxylic acid with
sulfamethazine has the amidine form and it has the distinction of
having S–H···π interactions. The cocrystal
of sulfamethazine with 2,6-pyridinecarboxylic acid is a rare example
of a 1:1 cocrystal of sulfmethazine with dicarboxylic acid. It has
methanol molecules as a solvent of crystallization. Sulfamethazine
forms a hydrated cocrystal with 4-(4-hydroxyphenylazo)-phenylcarboxylic
acid that has conventional R22(8) synthons of amidine hydrogen-bonding with carboxylic acid. The
phenolic part of the acid component is anchored to the water molecule
and provides a robust self-assembly. The hydrated cocrystal of sulfamethazine
with 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (2:2 cocrystal) has two independent
molecules of sulfamethazine, one in amidine form and the other in
imidine form. It has two neutral carboxylic acids anchored through
complementary hydrogen bonds and also has two water molecules of crystallization.
The cocrystal of sulfamethazine with 4-(phenyl)phenylcarboxylic acid
is also a 2:2 cocrystal. It is a di-hydrate, which has a neutral and
protonated form of sulfamethazine. The neutral form is hydrogen-bonded
to a neutral carboxylic acid, whereas the protonated form is charge-assisted
hydrogen-bonded to the corresponding carboxylate anion.

Introduction
The tautomeric forms
of organic compounds are well known to modulate
reactivity and physical properties.1−6 Amidine–imidine equilibriums in solution have impacts on
excited-state proton transfer processes in emission spectroscopy.7−10 Amidine–imidine equilibrium plays an important role in stabilization
of a particular tautomer of DNA base-pairs11−13 such as in
cytosine.14 Large numbers of organic compounds
show amidine–imidine equilibrium.14−17 Such equilibriums are studied
by various spectroscopic techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance,18 infrared spectroscopy,19,20 mass spectrometry,21 and in solid by
X-ray crystal structure determination.15 These equilibriums are stabilized in argon matrix22 and in practice existence of these forms in solution depend
on dielectric and hydrogen bond ability of the solvent. Those factors
associated with the solvent help to stabilize any of the forms or
allow both to co-exist and the ratio of the forms in solution changes
on slight change in conditions.23 The tautomeric
forms are extensively studied by X-ray crystallography.24−28 Stabilizations of amidine–imidine forms, a concept of enamine–imine
equilibrium, is very common in drugs; either of the forms of a drug
bearing such units are accomplished by varying crystallization conditions
and by cocrystal formation.29−39

For a solid-state study, crystallizing specifically one form
provides
an accurate picture of the bond parameters of the form and also allows
studying their interconversion with isolated cases. The amidine–imidine
forms have contributed significantly to the properties such as solubility,
bioavailability, and activity of applied pharmaceutical ingredients.38 Tautomers are also well-known to show polymorphism.
Although amidine or imidine forms of a number of drugs are stabilized,3 there are also certain studies dealing with base-pairs
of nucleo-bases relating the coexistence of the two forms40 in charge-assisted hydrogen-bonded dimers. The
amidine–imidine forms equilibrate through a shift of acidic
proton from one site to another site with structural changes to generate
two structures of relatively comparable energies.41 Among them, a good number of examples yield polymorphs.42−44 The weak interactions such as anion−π interactions
are dependent on the tautomeric form with which the anion can interact.45 The self-assemblies of multicomponent systems
are utilized in modification of fluorescence properties.46 In acidic condition any of these tautomers gets
easily protonated at one of the nitrogen atoms of the two independent
sites. Hence, it may be possible to prepare protonated species to
coexist in different combinations as illustrated in Figure 1a. As a case study, we have
studied here N-substituted pyrimidin-2-amine that may adopt amidine–imidine
(analogous of enamine–imine) forms (A and B) and their corresponding
mono-protonated forms C and D as shown in Figure 1a. The Cambridge structural database (CSD)
search shows that among 232 hits for aminopyrimidine structures, only
four examples on coexistence of cation and neutral forms are available.47−50 There are also examples of dicationic species of aminopyrimidine.51−53 On the other hand, there are 199 hits in CSD for the structures
of 2-aminopyridine; there are six examples dealing with neutral and
cation forms in the same compound.54−59 Recently, we have found that aggregated assemblies of two independent
polymorphs can be the third polymorph.60 As such a process is possible under specific conditions, it should
be possible to obtain amidinium–amidine, amidinium–imidine,
imidinium–amidine, and imidinium–imidine (F-I) forms
in cocrystals. There are examples of the amidine and imidine forms
stabilized in cocrystals.37 It has also
been shown that sulfamethazine forms a salt or a cocrystal with saccharine
on slight variation of crystallization conditions.61 Another point that enthused us was that, specific cocrystals
exist as assembly of symmetry nonequivalent pairs.37 The sulfamethazine (abbreviated as SM) is
an N-functionalized pyrimidin-2-amine derivative having a structure
shown in Figure 1b.
It forms various cocrystals with different carboxylic acids in the
amine or imine form. Depending on the acid–base properties
certain nitrogen-containing sulfa-drugs are well known to form a salt
or a cocrystal with carboxylic acid. There are 43 crystal structures
directly relating sulfamethazine are found in CSD search. Out of these
there is a structure of a 2:1 cocrystal of sulfamethazine with theophylline
that has coexistence of amidine and imidine tautomers together in
its structure; this was referred to as a hydrogen-shift isomerization.62,63 Thus, we have chosen sulfamethazine to study cocrystals with different
acid partners of which crystal structures were not determined earlier
and we also could get suitable diffraction quality crystals to carry
out the structural study. The partner acids studied in this study
are listed in Figure 1b. From the structural analyses of those crystals, we unravel the
form E where the two forms, namely amidine and imidine, exist and
also another cocrystal where the coexistence of neutral and protonated
forms coexist shown as F in Figure 1a.

Results and Discussion
Among the five structures of cocrystals
examined in this study,
the structures of two cocrystals are conventional. Each has a 1:1
molar ratio of SM and carboxylic acid. These two cocrystals
are with 2-mercaptophenylcarboxylic acid and 4-(4-hydroxy phenylazo)phenylcarboxylic
acid. The cocrystal with 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid has also methanol
as another counterpart where SM/acid/methanol are in
a 1:1:1 molar ratio. However, the other cocrystals with 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic
acid or 4-(phenyl)phenylcarboxylic acid are exceptions. They have SM to carboxylic acid in a 2:2 molar ratio and each is a hydrated
cocrystal.

SM·TSCA
The self-assembly of the cocrystal of
2-mercaptophenylcarboxylic acid with SM (SM·TSCA) has the amidine form of SM linked to the carboxylic
acid functional group through complementary hydrogen-bonded units
with R22(8) graph-set notation.64 The assembly is formed by O3–H3A···N3
and N2–H2A···O4 hydrogen bonds. The S–H
bond of the TSCA is not involved in the intramolecular
hydrogen bond, which is utilized to hold a neighbor SM molecule though S–H···π interactions
(dSH···π 3.232 Å).
The S–H···π interactions are observed
with negatively charged electronically tunable aromatic π-face.65 The reported structures of a cocrystal of SM·3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid as well as that of SM·1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid are guided by two independently
distinguishable type synthons66 with R22(8) graph set-notations.37 In the cocrystal SM·3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic
acid the SM molecule exists in imidine form, whereas
in the case of the self-assemblies of the SM·1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic
acid, the SM molecule is in amidine form.37 In the present case of the SM·TSCA cocrystal, the amidine form is observed. The SM molecules
are arranged as a cyclic assembly as illustrated in Figure 2b and are guided by N–H···O
interactions between the −SO2– and NH2–group of the neighboring molecules also through C–H···π
interactions one each from C–H bonds of methyl-groups with
the π-cloud of the pyrimidine ring (dCH···π(centroid) 3.014 Å). The cyclic assemblies are formed because of the change
in shape of the SM molecules, which adopt a propeller
shape in lieu of the regularly observed V-shape geometry.34

interaction in the cocrystal SM·TSCA; (b) robust
cyclic assembly formed by self-interactions among SM molecules
in SM·TSCA.

SM·PDC·MeOH
The cocrystals of dicarboxylic
acid such as SM·fumaric acid were earlier observed
in a 2:1 molar ratio.37 When we studied
the cocrystal of the 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid abbreviated as SM·PDC·MeOH we found out that the cocrystal crystallized
from a methanol solution of SM and PDC in
a 1:1 molar ratio. The cocrystal has a molecule of SM, a PDC, and a methanol molecule as constituents. The
nitrogen atom of the PDC does not form a hydrogen bond
with SM directly; but the nitrogen atom is involved in
a hydrogen bond with a methanol molecule. The methanol molecule serves
as a hydrogen bond donor and also as a hydrogen bond acceptor to interact
with the PDC. The nitrogen atom of the pyridine dicarboxylic
acid forms an O–H···N hydrogen bond with the
OH of the methanol and one of the C=O of the carboxylic acid
also hydrogen bonds with the OH of the methanol molecule to generate
bifurcated hydrogen bonds. The oxygen atom of the methanol hydrogen
bonds to the −OH group of the other carboxylic acid of the PDC. The facial approach of the SM gets inhibited
from one side to form a hydrogen bond with the PDC because
of those hydrogen bond schemes. Hence, this is a reason that facilitated
the formation of a 1:1 cocrystal in methanol. The oxygen atoms that
are exposed outwards on one face of the PDC form hydrogen
bonds with the SM molecule through O6–H ···N3
and N2–H···O5 hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond
donor–acceptor distances depicted in Figure 3 as d1 and d2 and the bond parameters listed in the Supporting Information suggest the synthon to
be composed of strong hydrogen bonds. The synthon formed by these
interactions is similar to the commonly observed hydrogen bonds between
the amidine form of the SM binding to a carboxylic acid.33 The SM molecule adopts the conventional
amidine form. The carboxylic acid group of each PDC having
the carboxylic O–H not participating in the hydrogen bond with
the methanol molecule anchors an SM molecule through
a conventional R22(8) type
synthon. The exposed face of the carboxylic acid at the other side
is involved in the hydrogen bond with methanol to form weak C8–H8C···O3
and C10–H10···O4 hydrogen bonded R22(8) synthons. The donor–acceptor distances
demarcated as d3 and d4 are marked in Figure 3. These distances
are within the admissible limit to have such weak interactions, and
in general C–H···O interactions contribute to
stability of noncovalent self-assemblies.67 Thus, there are two independent R22(8) synthons from the two carboxylic acid groups of the PDC; one is strongly held by moderate hydrogen bonds,68 whereas the other is by weak hydrogen bond interactions.
The prominent hydrogen bonds depicting the self-assembly of the cocrystal
is shown in Figure 3. The methanol molecule is held by hydrogen-bonding with two carboxylic
acids and is positioned unsymmetrically, forming R23(9) and R22(7) synthons. The R23(9) has involvement of the one of the oxygen atoms of the −SO2– group through C20–H···O2 interactions.

bonds in SM·PDC·MeOH facilitating
one-dimensional architecture that are together linked through N–H···O
interactions of amine and −SO2– with neighboring
molecules.

The PDC molecules
provide a hydrogen-bonded bridge
to hold two molecules of SM at two sides as depicted
in Figure 3. These
bridging interactions of the PDC provide a one-dimensional
chain-like structure. Together with these interactions one of the
N–H of the −NH2– group of the phenylamine
part form hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atom of the −SO2– group of another SM molecule located
in the near vicinity. This provides extended hydrogen-bonded self-assembly.

SM·ABA·H2O
There are examples in literature of SM cocrystals
with aromatic carboxylic acid bearing the hydroxy37 or the amino group39 at the
para-position of the ring. It was found that in the cocrystals, SM·4-hydroxybenzoic acid as well as in the SM·4-aminobenzoic acid a conventional V-shape structure of SM was not observed but a propeller shape was observed. Here,
we have studied the cocrystal of SM with 4-(4-hydroxyphenylazo)phenylcarboxylic
acid (ABA) which has a hydroxy-aromatic ring linked to
a carboxylic acid unit though an intervening azo-group. The cocrystal
of SM with ABA is a hydrated 1:1 cocrystal
having a composition SM·ABA·H2O. The amidine form of SM in the
propeller shape is observed in this cocrystal; the SM molecule anchors the carboxylic acid functional group in a routine
manner through formation of R22(8) synthon, which comprises N2–H···O4 [Dd···a = 2.802(3) Å] and
O5–H···N3 [Dd···a = 2.685(3) Å] moderate hydrogen bonds (refer to Supporting
Information Table S1). In this example,
the functional groups attached to the N=N-group are in trans-disposition.
The water molecules act as linkers between the oxygen (O2) atom of
the −SO2– group and the oxygen atom (O3)
of the hydroxy-group of the neighboring molecules. The hydrogen atom
(H1B) of the NH2– group is hydrogen-bonded to the
oxygen atom (O1) of the −SO2– group of independent
molecules (Figure 4). These interactions provide robust hydrogen-bonded assembly with
spiral arrangements.

(SMamidine)(SMimidine)·2(PA)·2H2O
The cocrystal of a hydroxyphenyl
unit containing carboxylic acid with SM, namely of 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic
acid (PA), was also studied. We found that this cocrystal
has a completely different composition from the other cocrystals studied
here. It is a cocrystal where there are two SM molecules
per cocrystal; the two constituents of SM are structurally
different; one is in amidine and the other in imidine form (abbreviated
as SMamidine and SMimidine, respectively). Along with these
there are two neutral PA molecules as partner molecules.
There are also two molecules of water in each cocrystal. In general,
the cocrystals of SM have the amidine or the imidine
form of SM. One of these two forms occurs in a cocrystal
when there is a small energy difference between the two cocrystal
forms.37 In the present case, having both
these forms together, each of which interacts with partner molecules
in independent fashions, makes it an unusual example. Though there
was an example in the literature of the amidine–imidine form
in a cocrystal,62,63 in that example the amidine and
imidine forms occurred as dimers, which is not the case in the present
example. The amidine portion of the cocrystal has a conventional hydrogen-bonded R22(8) synthon (Figure 5). The imidine form of the SM molecule loses the aromaticity and the hydrogen ion migrates from
the N–H to one ring nitrogen, which creates a hydrogen bond
donor site at a position exactly opposite to the amidine form. This
change also provides complementary geometry to form a hydrogen bond
with the carboxylic acid. Accordingly, it forms an R22(8) hydrogen-bonded cyclic synthon. The differences
in the bond distances in the two synthons are listed in Figure 5a. The carboxylic acid–amidine
hydrogen-bonded heterodimeric synthon has d1 = 2.896 Å and d2 = 2.619 Å.
However, the acid–imidine synthon is of higher symmetry and
it has d3 = 2.759 Å, whereas d4 = 2.713 Å. The relatively short hydrogen
bond with a more symmetric structure is suggestive of the sp3-character of the N–H center of the amidine which makes a
difference to the sp2-nitrogen center of the imidine. In
the case of the acid–amidine synthon, the ring nitrogen atom
of SM is involved in aromaticity and the extended conjugation
involving the SO2 group with this nitrogen atom is lacking.
It makes slightly different environments than the other counterpart.
The lattice water molecule participates in the bifurcated hydrogen-bonding
with this synthon to make another supportive synthon. This is not
case with the acid–imidine synthon (refer to Figure 5a). The water molecules in
the self-assembly act as fillers and provide extra support to form
a tight-packed structure by maximum utilization of the available hydrogen
bond sites. The water molecules are held between the hydroxy group
and the −SO2– groups in different manners
because of the changes in the hydrogen-bonding schemes originating
from amidine–imidine forms. A portion of the imidine–acid
synthon is connected to the −SO2– group where
there is an extended conjugation. The synthon provides complementary
geometry for having the O11–H11B···O4 hydrogen
bond. Thus, the supportive hydrogen bond schemes associated across
the two R22(8) cyclic units
of amidine–acid, imidine–acid synthons are different
and contribute to stabilize a more symmetric or less symmetric synthon.
The prominent weak interactions distinguishing the two different synthons
within the self-assembly of the cocrystal are shown in Figure 5a. Furthermore, the amidine
and imidine SM molecules are positioned in a very orderly
manner in alternative positions; each is linked through N1–H1A···O4
and N5–H5A···O1 interactions as depicted in Figure 5b. The hydrogen bond
parameters are included in the Supporting Information Table S1. The chains formed are aligned in a parallel manner to
provide a Herringbone structure. There are also C–H···π
interactions, highlighted in Figure 5b. These interactions are suggested on the basis of
the observed distances of the C–H groups projecting perpendicular
to the aromatic rings.69 The C–H···π
interactions contribute to the stability of the assembly and help
the rings participating in such interactions to remain in a near perpendicular
manner to each other. The amidine rings and the 4-hydroxyphenyl rings
in the lattice are parallel and the centroid to centroid distance
is 3.875 Å. This distance is larger than the generally required
3.5 Å distance to have highly favorable π–π
interaction,70 but the parallel stacks
between the rings of which one is electron rich and other is electron-deficient
contribute to the self-assembly in a constructive manner.

hydrogen bonds and (b) the self-assembly of the two
forms of SM observed in the (SMamidine)(SMimidine)·2(PA)·2H2O.

(SM)(HSM)·(HBPA)(BPA)·2H2O
On the other hand,
the cocrystal of
4-(phenyl)phenylcarboxylic acid with SM has provided
a new insight. It has one neutral, one protonated SM molecule
(abbreviated as HSM) along with a neutral HBPA molecule and a BPA anion. The structure of the cocrystal (SM)(HSM)·(HBPA)(BPA)·2H2O is shown in Figure 6a. Depending on the pKa a large number of amidine-based compounds form cocrystals or salts.
In those cases, acid–base properties with narrow pKa differences have a tendency to form either of the forms.30 However, the cocrystal with 4-(phenyl)phenylcarboxylic
acid has both the forms, namel,y neutral and protonated forms of SM in the same cocrystal. In the self-assembly, a grid-like
architecture is formed by the SM and HSM molecules are positioned next to each other. The neutral and protonated
forms are in amidine form and each has a propeller shape. They are
linked to each other through weak N–H(phenylamine)···O(SO2) interactions in head-to-head
arrangements so that pyrimidine parts are almost vertically held on
the chain. Another chain of same kind assembles provide hydrogen bonded
grid-like assembly in which
the voids are occupied by the BPA molecules. The aromatic
ring of the BPA and the pyrimidine rings of SM are parallel to each other. The phenyl ring at the para-position
of the phenylcarboxylate anion is involved in π-interactions
with the amidine ring of the neutral form. The π–π
centroid distance in this case is 3.658 Å. The two phenyl rings
of the HBPA molecule in neutral form are in one plane,
whereas in the case of the anion these are not in one plane. The dihedral
angle between the planes of the two phenyl rings of the biphenyl unit
in the anionic form is 28.84°. The difference in the planarity
of the biphenyl part in the anion is due to the participation of the
phenyl ring in the π-interactions. To have such an interaction
the phenyl ring takes a twist to be parallel to the pyrimidine ring
of the neutral SM molecule. The SM molecule
is protonated on the pyrimidine ring. The protonated form provides
two hydrogen bond donors forming an R22(8) hydrogen-bonded unit with the carboxylate anion.
This synthon has charge-assisted hydrogen bonds.71 Hence, the proton-transfer has caused the ionic forms not
only to change the hydrogen bond donor–acceptor property but
also get involved in charge-assisted hydrogen bonds. A comparison
of the two R22(8) synthons
shows that the neutral form has d1 and d2 of 2.661 and 2.805 Å, respectively, whereas
the ionic form has d3 and d4 of 2.758 and 2.709 Å, respectively. The latter
has a symmetric synthon as the dicarboxylate anion is delocalized
where the two C–O environments are similar. The C–O
bonds of the carboxylate have partial double-bond character.

arrangements holding the carboxylic acid molecules in the cocrystal (SM)(HSM)·(HBPA)(BPA)·2H2O.

Structural Comparisons
The Hirshfeld surface analysis of each cocrystal is carried out
using the corresponding crystallographic information file. The analyses
are suggestive of the fact that the O–H interactions are predominant
in each case and their contribution varied from ∼23 to ∼29%.
The relative contributions of the different hydrogen bonds are listed
in the Supporting Information Table S3.
The hydrogen bond interactions of the carboxylic acid/carboxylate
ion with SM/HSM are revealed from the surface analysis
in each case. As a representative case the surface analyses establishing
these features in the 2:2 cocrystals are shown by red marks on the
surfaces in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Hirshfeld surface analyses showing the hydrogen bonds of the carboxylic
acids and carboxylates (a) (SMamidine)(SMimidine)·2(PA)·2H2O and (b) SM·HSM·HBPA.BPA·2H2O.

The cationic and neutral forms
of amino-pyridines are observed
generally in the salts with large anions such as poly-oxometallate
anions or as ionic cocrystals.54−59 However, in the present case it has been possible by utilization
of the extra supramolecular features on the amidine scaffold of the SM molecule to stabilize pairs with and without charge-assisted
hydrogen bonds in the same compound. The above discussions have clearly
established the coexistence of two or more forms in the same cocrystal.
In earlier examples, two symmetry nonequivalent molecules of SM and two carboxylic acid molecules were observed in the
asymmetric unit of the cocrystal of SM with 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic
acid.37 Narrow energy differences between
the different cocrystals having different tautomeric forms are a reason
to observe a particular form under a suitable condition. We have calculated
independently the energy of the neutral forms of the sulfamethazine
and two possible protonated states of SM; the results
are shown in Figure 8. It is found that the amidine form is stable and the energy difference
between the amidine and imidine in the neutral form is 48.40 kJ/mol.
The difference in the protonation of amidine at the ring nitrogen
and exocyclic secondary amine is also calculated and it is found that
the ring protonation is favorable by 41.05 kJ/mol. An acid with moderate
acidity may not easily protonate SM. Hence, in such a
case other factors come into play; for example the cocrystal of the
4-(phenyl)phenylcarboxylic acid forms ionic cocrystals having a charge-assisted
hydrogen bond to maximize the charge-transfer interactions between
the rings.

forms of SM calculated by DFT based on the B3LYP functional
using 6-311G++(2df,2p) as the basis set.

To demonstrate the existence of the different forms
in the unit
cell, such as the combinations of the tautomeric forms or combination
of protonated and neutral forms of SM in these cocrystals,
a comparison of the C=N and C–N bond distances of the
amidine and imidine and protonated rings are compiled in Table 1. The C–N bond
distances of different forms available from selected representative
references are also compared in Table 1 with them to show the agreement of our assignments.
The bond distances of the C–N bond in the ring of the neutral
amidine form are between 1.317 and 1.354 Å. These values of bond
distances fall in between the conventional C–N bond and C=N
bond distance of 1.47 and 1.25 Å, respectively. The difference
in the two C–N bonds of the rings in each case is slightly
different. The bond observed in the exocyclic C–N bond distance
of the amidine form varies between 1.366 and 1.401 Å. This variation
is comparatively large and is attributed to the participation of the
electrons on the nitrogen atom in conjugation with the aromatic ring.
The efficiency of the partner acid to participate in complementary
hydrogen bonds decides the faith of formation amidine–acid
or imidine–acid synthon. There are distinct bond distances,
by which the amidine and imidine forms can be clearly distinguished.
The imidine form of (SMamidine)(SMimidine)·2(PA)·2H2O has an exocyclic C=N
bond distance 1.348 Å and there are two bond distances for the
endocyclic C–N bond (one is 1.338 Å and other is 1.355
Å). These two distances indicate extended conjugation in the
imidine form. The protonated and neutral forms also have distinguishable
bond distances, for example, the protonation at the ring causes elongation
of the one endocyclic C–N bond where the proton is attached.
The distances are compared with several other common cocrystals37 and salts61 found
in literature. We found that our results on different bond parameters
in the observations of multiple rings are valid as compared to the
others. There is an example of a cocrystal of SM with
1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid37 in which two
symmetry nonequivalent cocrystals of SM were observed.
In such a case, the bond parameters of the two amidine forms have
close similarities (Table 1), but our coexisting amidine and imidine forms have distinguishable
bond distances. Several other cocrystals involving purely the neutral
form of SM are available in literature.71−73 There is a report of the salt of 2-carboxy-4,6-dinitrophenolic acid
with SM; the cationic part of this salt has similar bond
parameters74 as that of the protonated
amidine unit observed in the SM of the salt with 4-(phenyl)phenylcarboxylic
acid. The difference in the latter case had an additional neural SM molecule together with a neutral BPA molecule in the cocrystal.
This increases the number of different forms of components within
the unit cell, which is an interesting observation.

Table 1 Comparison of C–N Bond-Distances
Observed in the Different Forms of SM Found in Cocrystals
and Salts
Once these cocrystals
are dissolved in solvents used for NMR study,
only the 1H NMR signals of the parent components are observed
without any significant shift from the original cases. Hence, the
forms clearly discernible in solid are not distinguishable in solution.
The 1H NMR spectra of the cocrystals have revealed that
only the amidine form in each case is seen in their respective solution.
Same is the case with the neutral and protonated forms. There is no
distinction in solution once the cocrystal (SM)(HSM)·(HBPA)(BPA)·2H2O is dissolved in DMSO-d6 (please refer to the Supporting Information NMR spectra). These indicate that the stable form
is observed in solution and the special features seen in the tight-packed
structures of solid samples are lost. However, the physical properties
of solids are dependent on the solvation and the conformers. In the
thermogravimetric study (Supporting Information Figure S16) it was observed that weight loss corresponding to loss
of water molecules from the hydrated cocrystals corresponded to the
weight of the amount of hydrated water present per mole in the respective
cocrystal. Namely, the SM·ABA·H2O, (SMamidine)(SMimidine)·2(PA)·2H2O and SM·HSM·HBPA·BPA·2H2O lose water molecules at the
ranges 91–112 °C (decomposes at >250 °C), 70–95
°C (decomposes at > 150 °C), and 95–115 °C
(decomposes
at >200 °C), respectively. The SM·PDC·MeOH loses methanol at 55–70 °C (decomposes at >230 °C),
whereas the cocrystal SM·TSCA being anhydrous, it
does not show any weight loss before its decomposition above 200 °C.
The melting point of cocrystals of sulfamethazine differs from parent SM and varies with partner molecules. The differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) has been extensively used to predict the composition
in which SM would form a cocrystal with a partner molecule.75 In general, sharp melting points for the cocrystals
of SM were observed. The DSC of the parent SM and each cocrystal was independently recorded; these are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 DSC plots of (i) SM, (ii) SM·TSCA, (iii) SM·PDC·MeOH, (iv) SM·ABA·H2O, (v) (SMamidine)(SMimidine)·2(PA)·2H2O, and (vi) SM·HSM·HBPA·BPA·2H2O.

The sulfamethazine melts at 198 °C. The anhydrous cocrystal SM·TSCA melts at 172 °C. The solvated 1:1 cocrystal SM·PDC·MeOH shows a broad endothermic peak extending
from 60 to 90 °C because of loss of methanol, followed by melting
at 214 °C. It also shows another endothermic peak at 223 °C.
The SM·ABA·H2O loses water molecules at 106 °C, followed by melting
at 213 °C. The (SMamidine)(SMimidine)·2(PA)·2H2O loses water at a relatively
lower temperature of 73 °C followed by melting at 148 °C.
The ionic nature of the cocrystal SM·HSM·HBPA·BPA·2H2O enforces this cocrystal to
lose water molecules at a relatively higher temperature at 115 °C
and there is a minor endothermic peak at 186 °C, which is probably
due to the structural changes from the loss of water and the salt
melts at 201 °C. The infrared (IR) spectra of the salts have
differences in peak positions in the finger-print region in each case.
Because of multiple closely spaced peaks in these regions, it is difficult
to clearly discern the differences with particular stretching. Nonetheless,
the comparison of the IR of each component is indicative of the differences
in IR signals of the cocrystal (Supporting Information). The powder XRD patterns of all the cocrystals were determined.
These powder-XRD patterns listed in the Supporting Information are compared with the powder XRD pattern generated
from the corresponding crystallographic information file.

In
conclusion, we have divulged a new rare example of having two
tautomeric forms, namely amidine and imidine forms of the same compound
together in a cocrystal and made a comparison of the prominent bond
parameters contributing to the neutral amidine, protonated amidine,
neutral imidine forms of SM found in the cocrystals and
salts. The ranges of the prominent bond parameters from the forms
differentiating each form presented here and the reported ones from
the CSD that distinguish them are listed in Table 2. Though there was an example of a 1:2 cocrystal
of theophylline with SM, possessing amidine–imidine
tautomer together in the cocrystal, we have two pairs of amidine form
as well as imidine form hydrogen-bonding independently with two molecules
of 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (2:2 molar ratio); a unique example
of the cocrystal of SM that has a combination of protonated
and neutral partner molecules together in a cocrystal with the neutral
and anion of the other counterpart. These findings open up avenues
for new cocrystals of applied pharmaceutical ingredients by choosing
suitable partner molecules.

Experimental Section
The sulfamethazine and the acid
conformers used in this study were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Each cocrystal was prepared by dissolving
sulfamethazine (278 mg, 1 mmol) in reagent-grade methanol (25 mL)
and to it the respective carboxylic acid (1 mmol) was added and stirred
so that a clear solution was observed. In each case the reaction mixture
was filtered after stirring for half an hour using Whatman filter
paper to remove residue (if any). The transparent solution thus obtained
in each case was kept independently undisturbed inside fume-hood to
slowly evaporate at 25 °C. The crystals were allowed to form
in the solution in an undisturbed manner until the volume of the solution
became 3 mL (approximately) in each case, which was completed in 6–7
days. The yields of crystals are listed in the Supporting Information. The complete removal of the solvent
did not increase the yield of the highly pure crystals; hence, optimum
residual solvent in each solution was required to get highly pure
and suitably diffracting crystals.

Physical Measurements
Infrared spectra
of the solid
samples were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum-One FT-IR spectrophotometer
in the region 4000–400 cm–1 by making KBr
pellets. 1H NMR spectra of sulfamethazine and the cocrystals
were recorded on a Bruker Ascend-600 MHz NMR spectrometer using TMS
as internal standard. DSC and thermogravimetry studies were performed
using a thermal analyzer SDTQ600 simultaneous DTA/TGA system under
nitrogen with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Powder X-ray diffraction
patterns were recorded using a Bruker powder X-ray diffractometer
D2-phaser. Hirshfeld analyses are done by using Crystal Explorer 3.1
software. DFT calculations were done by using Gaussian 09 software.
Optimizations were done by DFT using the B3LYP functional with 6-311G++(2df,2p) as the basis set.

Crystallographic Study
The X-ray single-crystal diffraction
data for the SM·PDC·MeOH and (SM)(HSM)·(HBPA)(BPA)·2H2O were collected by an Oxford
SuperNova diffractometer and the data refinement and cell reductions
were carried out by CrysAlisPro. The diffraction data of the other
cocrystals were collected at room temperature with Mo Kα radiation
(λ = 0.71073 Å) on a Bruker Nonius SMART APEX CCD. The
diffractometer has a graphite monochromator and an Apex CCD camera.
SMART software was used for data collection and also for indexing
the reflections and determining the unit cell parameters. Data reduction
and cell refinement were performed using SAINT and XPREP software.
Structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-14 and were
refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELXL-14. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined in anisotropic
approximation against F2 of all reflections.
Hydrogen atoms were placed at their geometric positions and either
set to be “fixed” or “riding and refined”
in the isotropic approximation. The crystallographic parameters are
listed in Table 3.
