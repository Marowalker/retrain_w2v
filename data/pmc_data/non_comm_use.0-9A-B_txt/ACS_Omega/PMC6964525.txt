Two-dimensional materials with robust magnetic moments
are of great
interest to explore the exciting physics and applications of nanoscale
spintronic devices. However, the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states
often restrict the applications of symmetric MXenes. Herein, we proposed
a kind of Janus structure for the V-based nitride MXene V2N with one V layer replaced by the Ti/Cr layer. In this work, we
demonstrated from the first-principles calculations that although
the AFM ground states are formed, the Janus TiVN and CrVN monolayers
possess net magnetic moments of 1.97 and 0.28 μB per
formula unit, respectively. Moreover, the net magnetic moments of
TiVN and CrVN monolayers are robust even if considerable strains (−8
to 8%) are applied. Our results also show that TiVN and CrVN exhibit
half-metallic and metallic features, respectively. These properties
widen the potential applications of Janus V-based MXenes in spintronic
or other electronic devices.

1 Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) electronic
materials have been of great interest
to researchers since the discovery of graphene.1−3 Recently, a
new class of 2D transition-metal carbides, nitrides, or carbon nitrides,
that is, MXenes, with the general formula of Mn+1XnTx (M = transition metals, X = C and/or N, T = O, OH, F, n = 1–3), has received more and more attention since its synthesis.
Their structures and properties are extensively predicted from the
theoretical point of view.4−8 Studies have shown that MXenes, as an important layered material,
have excellent electrical properties, optical properties, thermal
stability, and mechanical properties, and have been well applied in
the fields of energy storage, catalysis, etc.4,9−13 Among the various MXene materials, the research on 2D transition-metal
carbides has been relatively abundant. Theoretical investigations
show that different carbide MXenes, such as Ti3C2,14−16 Ti2C,17 and Cr2C,6 could exhibit different magnetic properties.
Compared with the carbide MXenes, nitride-based MXenes possess several
potential advantages, such as a higher electronic conductivity than
their carbide counterparts18 and higher
magnetic moments,19 and may be suitable
candidates for electrodes in electrochemical capacitors or metamaterial
devices.20,21

Previous studies of symmetric MXene
materials show that most of
them have been predicted to have an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground
state, such as Cr2N22 as well
as the Ti2N monolayer.21 As
a result of the same spin-polarized ability and antiparallel alignment
of transition-metal atoms in the symmetric structures, the total magnetic
moment of the whole system would remain zero. Considering that the
MXenes, M2X, are composed of two transition-metal layers,
we could replace one layer with another transition-metal layer, forming
the so-called Janus structure. If the asymmetric factor is taken into
account, the net magnetic moments are extremely possible to be found
due to the different atomic magnetic moments in the different transition-metal
layers. In this situation, a considerable magnetic moment could be
observed for the systems even if they are in antiferromagnetic ground
states. It indicates that on the basis of the pristine state, an asymmetrical
alignment of the transition-metal ions on each layer can result in
a different chemical environment, which may regulate the physical
and chemical properties of the material itself. Recently, first-principles
calculations have predicted that Janus Cr2I3X3 (X = Br, Cl) monolayers are indirect-bandgap semiconductors
with good stability, intrinsic ferromagnetism, and electric polarization.23 A previous study on a Janus VSSe monolayer shows
that it has room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering with piezoelectricity,
ferroelasticity, and a large valley polarization.24 Therefore, it is meaningful to search for the Janus MXenes
with robust net magnetic moments.

In this work, we studied the
structural, magnetic, and electronic
properties and the dynamic stability of two V-based Janus nitride
MXenes, TiVN and CrVN monolayers, by means of first-principles calculations.
Our results show that considerable net magnetic moments can be found
in both TiVN and CrVN with antiferromagnetic ground states. TiVN and
CrVN exhibit half-metallic and metallic features, respectively. Furthermore,
strain application demonstrates that both TiVN and CrVN have robust
net magnetic moments with the strain ranging from −8 to 8%.
These properties make V-based Janus MXenes have potential applications
in spintronic or other electronic devices.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Magnetic Structures of Symmetric V2N and Janus TiVN and CrVN Monolayers
The structures of MXenes
were built from their corresponding MAX phases by removing the A-group
(mostly IIIA and IVA) element atomic layer.6 The structure of the V2N monolayer is shown in Figure 1. The middle N layer
is sandwiched by two V layers. Each V atom is bonded with three N
atoms with the same bond lengths. An interlayer vacuum space of 15
Å was imposed on the neighboring slabs to eliminate possible
interactions of individual layers.

Figure 1 (a) Top view and (b) side view of monolayer
V2N, TiVN,
and CrVN. Gray balls and red balls represent the N atoms and V atoms,
while blue balls represent the Ti/V/Cr atoms.

Before calculating the electronic structures and
magnetic properties
of the V2N monolayer, we performed the geometry optimization
by relaxing both lattice constants and atomic positions. Considering
the magnetism of the V element, we employed both ferromagnetic (FM)
and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders for the unit cell of the V2N monolayer. For the AFM magnetic state, the initial magnetic
moments of the top V atom and the bottom V atom are antiparallel.
After structural optimization, it is found that the total energy of
the V2N monolayer with AFM order is 398 meV lower than
that with FM order. Therefore, the V2N monolayer with AFM
order is more stable when compared with FM order. Table 1 lists the structural parameters
and magnetic moments of the V2N monolayer with AFM order.
The optimized lattice constant and the corresponding bond lengths
between V and N atoms are 3.193 and 2.141 Å, respectively. The
atomic magnetic moment of V is 2.63 μB. Due to the
AFM order, the total magnetic moment for the V2N monolayer
is 0 μB. To further confirm that the AFM order with
an antiparallel alignment of the top V atom and the bottom V atom
in the unit cell is the ground state, we considered other different
AFM orders within a 2 × 1 × 1 V2N supercell. Figure 2 shows the V2N monolayer with FM order and three different AFM orders,
which are labeled as AFM1, AFM2, and AFM3. It is noted that the AFM1
magnetic order corresponds to the AFM order in a unit cell. Total
energy calculations show that the energy of AFM1 is significantly
lower than that of the other three magnetic orders (FM, AFM2, and
AFM3). The energy differences between AFM1 and the other magnetic
states are listed in Table 2, which indicate that the energy of the AFM1 order is at least
346 meV lower than that of the other magnetic states. As a result,
the magnetic order with the parallel alignment in the intralayer and
antiparallel alignment in the interlayer is the ground state for the
V2N monolayer.

However, strangely, it is noted that the previous
results reported
by Gao et al.25 demonstrated the nonmagnetic
(NM) state of the V2N monolayer with zero magnetic moment
of the V atom, regardless of the FM and AFM initial magnetic settings.
Further analysis indicates that Gao et al. used the GGA method in
their calculations without adding the Hubbard model. To confirm the
effect of the Hubbard model, we reoptimized the structures of the
V2N monolayer with the GGA method. Our results show that
both FM and AFM magnetic orders would result in the NM states, which
is consistent with the results of Gao et al. Obviously, the correlation
effect of electrons essentially affects the magnetic ground state.
Furthermore, by applying the GGA + U method, we compared
the energy of AFM V2N with that of the NM state. It is
found that the V2N monolayer with AFM order remains at
a lower energy with respect to the NM state.

Based on the V2N monolayer structure, we replaced the
top V atom with one Ti or Cr atom to obtain the asymmetric layer structure,
labeled as Janus V-based MXenes. Figure 1a,b presents the top and side views of Janus
TiVN and CrVN monolayers.

We first optimized the structural
parameters of the TiVN and CrVN
monolayers. In our calculations, the GGA + U method
is used not only for the V atom but also for Ti and Cr atoms. The
optimized results are presented in Table 1. Similar to the case of V2N,
both FM and AFM orders for the unit cell of TiVN and CrVN monolayers
were considered. Table 1 shows that the AFM order is more stable than the FM order. The total
energies of AFM orders are 205 and 398 meV lower than those of FM
orders for TiVN and CrVN monolayers, respectively. Therefore, the
ground states of Janus TiVN and CrVN monolayers retain the AFM orders.
It is also noted that the considerable magnetic moments of the whole
AFM systems for TiVN and CrVN monolayers are −1.97 and 0.28
μB per unit cell, respectively. Further analysis
indicates that the non-zero net magnetic moments originate from the
unequal local magnetic moments of Ti/Cr and V atoms (Table 1). We also considered the FM
order and the three AFM orders that are shown in Figure 2 to identify the most stable
magnetic configuration. Total energy calculations demonstrate that
either TiVN or CrVN has an AFM1 ground state, which is an in-plane
FM coupling, whereas an AFM coupling for interlayers. The differences
in the total energy between AFM1 and the other magnetic structures
are also listed in Table 2. Based on the AFM order, it is found that the optimized lattice
constants of TiVN and CrVN are 3.071 and 3.116 Å, respectively.
The lattice constants of Janus TiVN and CrVN are slightly smaller
than that of V2N. The bond lengths between Ti/Cr and N
are 2.097/2.015 Å in the TiVN/CrVN monolayer. The bond lengths
between V and N are 2.167 and 2.225 Å for TiVN and CrVN, respectively.

2.2 Dynamical Stability of Janus TiVN and CrVN
Considering that the Janus TiVN and CrVN monolayers have not been
experimentally synthesized, their vibrational property needs to be
investigated to examine the dynamical stability. The phonon spectra
of these two Janus monolayers are shown in Figure 3. A primitive cell of the Janus MXene monolayer
contains three atoms. Therefore, nine phonon branches are included
in the phonon spectra. It is significant to find that there is no
imaginary frequency at any wave vector for the phonon dispersion curves,
which demonstrates that the given structures of the Janus V-based
MXene monolayers are dynamically stable. Besides the experimental
pristine structure of V2N, thus, Janus TiVN and CrVN monolayers
would be likely realized in the future. It is surely interesting to
study their magnetic, electronic, and other physical or chemical properties.

2.3 Electronic Structures of Symmetric V2N and Janus TiVN and CrVN Monolayers
To further understand
the correlation effects of electrons on the electronic structures,
we plotted the density of states (DOS) of the V2N monolayer
with the GGA and GGA + U methods. Figure 4 shows the total density of
states (TDOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) of N-2p and V-3d
orbitals. As we know, the spin magnetic moments originate from the
difference between the number of up-spin and down-spin electrons.
From Figure 4, it is
found that the occupied states of N atoms are equal for the up-spin
and down-spin channels. Therefore, the contribution of N atoms to
the magnetic moments is less, regardless of the GGA or GGA + U methods. When the GGA + U method is applied,
a strong spin polarization of V-3d orbitals is observed. For the V
atom in the top layer, the occupied up-spin states (V1-3d)
are significantly larger than the down-spin ones, which results in
a large local magnetic moment, as shown in Figure 4b. Similarly, the V atom in the bottom layer
(V2-3d) produces an opposite magnetic moment with respect
to the V atom in the top layer. Therefore, despite the non-zero local
magnetic moment of V atoms, the total magnetic moment of the whole
system is zero, which corresponds to the AFM order. However, when
the GGA method is applied, the occupied down-spin states of the V
atom in the top layer evidently increase, while the occupied up-spin
states decrease, as shown in Figure 4a. Such a change ultimately results in the zero magnetic
moment of the V atom in the top layer. A similar situation is also
found for the V atom in the bottom layer. Obviously, the magnetic
moment of the entire system is zero.

Figure 4 Total and projected densities of states
of the V2N monolayer
with (a) the GGA and (b) the GGA + U methods.

The comparison of the results from the GGA and
GGA + U methods shows that the interaction between
strongly localized electrons
has a great influence on the electronic structures of the V2N monolayer. Such a strong correlation is mainly reflected in the
3d electrons of the transition-metal atoms. At the GGA + U level, this Coulomb repulsion increases the difference between the
number of electrons occupying the up-spin and down-spin channels,
thus leading to the increase of the atomic magnetic moment.26,27 In contrast, the GGA method underestimates the correlation interaction
between electrons. Considering the local 3d-orbital of V atoms, thus,
we used the GGA + U method for the V-based MXenes
materials in our calculations.

Figure 5a,b shows
the TDOS and PDOS of TiVN and CrVN monolayers with AFM order. It can
be seen that the DOSs of the two systems share similar characteristics.
The states near the Fermi level are contributed by the transition-metal
atoms Ti/Cr and V. In the TiVN/CrVN monolayer, the occupied up-spin
states near the Fermi level are from Ti-3d/Cr-3d orbitals, while the
down-spin ones are from V-3d orbitals. Therefore, distinct spin polarization
is observed for these transition-metal atoms, which ultimately results
in the local magnetic moments. On the other hand, the occupied up-spin
states are inequal to the down-spin ones, regardless of the TiVN or
CrVN monolayer, thus making the entire system process the net magnetic
moments. As shown in Figure 5c,d, the spin-polarized energy band structures for both spins
also imply the magnetism. As a result, the net magnetic moments are
easy to be found in the asymmetric Janus V-based MXenes due to the
different spin-polarized abilities of the transition-metal atoms in
the top and bottom layers.

of the TiVN monolayer
with AFM order. (b) Density of states and (d) band structure of the
CrVN monolayer with AFM order. The Fermi levels are all set to 0 eV.

The energy band structure of CrVN exhibits a metallic
characteristic
as the bands in both spin channels cross the Fermi level, as shown
in Figure 5d. In contrast,
the calculated energy band structure reveals that TiVN with AFM order
is half-metallic with the existence of a metallic transport behavior
for one spin channel and a semiconducting behavior for the other,
as shown in Figure 5c. Such a half-metallicity with a small band gap for the up-spin
channel leads to 100% spin polarization of the conduction electrons,
and the conductivity is dominated by single-spin charge carriers.
Materials with such a behavior are highly desired for next-generation
spintronic devices, such as spin filters, spin injectors, and magnetic
sensors.28,29

2.4 Effect of Strain on the Magnetic Moments of
Janus TiVN and CrVN
As existing studies have indicated that
the electronic and magnetic properties could be tunable by strain
for 2D materials from the experimental and theoretical points of view,30−32 it is meaningful to search for robust, highly desirable magnetic
properties in 2D materials. As mentioned above, despite the AFM ground
states of Janus TiVN and CrVN, net magnetic moments of TiVN and CrVN
monolayers still remain the same. To study the magnetism of TiVN and
CrVN against external stress, we apply biaxial strains from −8
to 8% to the AFM TiVN and CrVN monolayers. Here, the strain (ε)
is defined as the ratio between the change of lattice constant (Δa) and the equilibrium lattice constant (a), namely ε = Δa/a.
A positive value means tensile strain, while a negative value means
compressive strain. Generally, the lattice mismatch, coefficient of
thermal expansion mismatch, and substrate compression can be used
to generate wrinkling and realize the strain in 2D materials. Despite
this, a strain as large as 8% is indeed hard to be realized for 2D
materials in the experiments. However, our study aims to prove the
total magnetic moments of CrVN and TiVN being insensitive to the strain.
As a result, the wide range of strain (−8 to 8%) is considered
in our calculations. Our results reveal that either TiVN or CrVN maintains
strong antiferromagnetism, and the magnetic moment remains very powerful
under the different biaxial strains, indicating that the AFM characteristic
of TiVN and CrVN monolayers is robust under a large strain (up to
8% biaxial strain). Furthermore, Figure 6a gives the calculated magnetic moments of
TiVN and CrVN as a function of strain. One can see that the variation
in the total magnetic moment of the TiVN monolayer is always maintained
at a very small value, which is no more than 0.5 μB. When it comes to CrVN, similar to TiVN, its total magnetic moment
varies slightly. When the strains (−8 to 8%) are applied, the
total magnetic moments range from 0.542 to 0.144μB.

Figure 6 (a) Calculated total magnetic moments of TiVN and CrVN monolayers
under different strains. AFM orders are applied for both TiVN and
CrVN. (b) Calculated local magnetic moments of V, Ti, and Cr atoms
in TiVN and CrVN monolayers under different strains.

Further understanding of the detailed change of
total magnetic
moments with different strains for TiVN and CrVN could be achieved
from Figure 6b, which
provides the local magnetic moments of V, Ti, and Cr atoms in TiVN
and CrVN monolayers under different strains. With the increase of
compressive strains, the local magnetic moments undergo little change
for Ti and Cr atoms but decrease for V atoms in TiVN and CrVN cases.
On the other hand, with the increase of tensile strains, the local
magnetic moments increase for Ti and Cr atoms and also slightly increase
for V atoms. Considering the opposite directions of magnetic moments
for Ti/Cr and V atoms, the trend of total magnetic moments in Figure 6a could be easily
obtained.

To elucidate the trivial effect of strain on the magnetic
moments
of Janus V-based MXenes, we plotted the TDOS and PDOS of the TiVN
monolayer under different strains as an example, which are shown in Figure 7. It is found that
the changes of magnetic moments of TiVN under strains are almost dominated
by Ti and V atoms. The contribution of N is negligible. With the strain
changing from −5 to 5%, namely from compressive to tensile,
the expansion of the occupied states near the Fermi level decreases,
which is clearly observed from the increase of the energy gap around
−3 eV. This is due to the increase of the distance between
Ti/V and N atoms with the strain changing from compressive to tensile,
thus reducing the interaction between atoms as well as the orbital
overlap. Despite this, it can also be seen from Figure 7 that the occupied states near the Fermi
level from Ti and V atoms have no distinct change within the whole
strain range. Obviously, the magnetic moments originating from Ti
and V atoms almost remain unchanged. Therefore, robust net magnetic
moments could be found in the TiVN and CrVN monolayers, which is strongly
against the external stress.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
studied the structural, dynamical, electronic,
and magnetic properties of Janus V-based nitride MXenes, TiVN and
CrVN, using the first-principles calculations based on the density
functional theory. Phonon spectra calculations show that the TiVN
and CrVN monolayers are dynamically stable. The TiVN and CrVN monolayers
still prefer the AFM order with the parallel arrangement of magnetic
moments in the intralayer and the antiparallel arrangement of magnetic
moments in the interlayer, which is the same as the symmetric MXene
V2N. Despite this, non-zero net magnetic moments could
be observed for the Janus TiVN and CrVN, which are −1.97 and
0.28 μB per formula unit, respectively. When strains
are applied, the net magnetic moments of TiVN and CrVN monolayers
remain stable, indicating that the magnetism of TiVN and CrVN is robust.
Density of states and energy band structures show that TiVN exhibits
a half-metallic behavior while CrVN is metallic. Our results demonstrate
the potential for the utilization of Janus MXenes in innovative spintronic
and electronic devices.

4 Computational Methods
All calculations
were performed using first-principles calculations
based on the density functional theory as implemented in the Vienna
ab initio simulation package (VASP).33,34 The projector
augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) exchange–correlation functional were adopted with a cutoff
energy of 500 eV for plane-wave expansions.35 The valence electron configurations of Ti, V, and Cr are 3s23p63d24s2, 3s23p63d44s1, and 3s23p63d54s1, respectively. The convergence
criteria of total energy and atomic force for each atom were set to
10–6 eV per unit cell and 10–3 eV/Å, respectively. A Monkhorst–Pack sampling method
with 12 × 12 × 1 and 32 × 32 × 1 k-point meshes in the Brillouin zone integration were used for the
calculations of structure optimization and density of states. Because
of the magnetism of transition-metal atoms, spin polarization was
taken into account in our calculations. As the correlation effect
is important in determining the electronic and magnetic properties
of 3d transition-metal atoms, the GGA + U method
(with the Hubbard U interaction) was employed with
the effective onsite Coulomb term Ueff = U – J. The Ueff values are chosen from previous studies, with 4.2,
4.0, and 3.0 eV for Ti, V, and Cr, respectively.19,36,37 Moreover, different Ueff values for each element are tested. The results show that
the energy differences between AFM and FM orders are basically independent
of the selected Ueff. To investigate the
dynamical stability of Janus nitride MXenes, the phonon spectra were
calculated by PHONOPY software.38
