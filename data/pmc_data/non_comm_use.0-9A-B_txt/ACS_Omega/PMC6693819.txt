We investigated an ss-DNA sequence that can stabilize a red- and
a green-emissive silver nanocluster (DNA-AgNC). These two emitters
can convert between each other in a reversible way. The change from
red- to green-emitting DNA-AgNCs can be triggered by the addition
of H2O2, while the opposite conversion can be
achieved by the addition of NaBH4. Besides demonstrating
the switching between red- and green-emissive DNA-AgNCs and determining
the recoverability, we fully characterized the photophysical properties,
such as steady-state emission, quantum yield, fluorescence lifetime,
and anisotropy of the two emissive species. Understanding the mechanism
behind the remarkable conversion between the two emitters could lead
to the development of a new range of DNA-AgNC-based ratiometric sensors.

Introduction
DNA-templated silver
nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs) are a relatively
new class of emitters formed by 2–30 silver atoms embedded
in one or multiple single-stranded DNA oligomers.1−3 Thanks to their
straightforward synthesis and tunability of excitation and emission
wavelengths,4−6 DNA-AgNCs have found several applications in sensing
and fluorescence imaging.7−11 Among the DNA sequences that stabilize emissive AgNCs, some can
produce one specific emitter, while others host a range of different
emitters. Typical examples of DNA sequences that can stabilize multiple
emitters are polycytosine (polyC) oligomers.12−14 The emission
wavelength of the emitters enclosed in such sequences tends to blue-shift
over time in ambient conditions.12,13,15 If oxidation is the cause of the observed spectral
blueshift, this could open up the possibility of developing DNA-AgNC-based
redox-sensitive probes. Choi et al. have recently explored this concept
for the detection of oxidizing species, like hypochlorite and reactive
oxygen species (ROS), using DNA-AgNCs.14,16 In their experiments,
ratiometric analysis of the emission in the presence of various oxidizing
agents was performed. A further extension of this concept would be
the development of reversible redox-sensitive ratiometric probes,
which would be beneficial for many applications because the number
of such probes available is currently limited.17,18 Li et al. showed reversible switching between red- and green-emissive
AgNCs stabilized in a DNA hydrogel.19 These
AgNCs were applied to detect ROS and reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS)
in living cells, thanks to their sensitivity to •OH radicals. Another example of conversion between differently colored
AgNCs triggered by H2O2 and NaBH4 was provided by Anand et al., who used human serum albumin (HSA)
as a scaffold to stabilize the AgNCs.20 HSA can stabilize a blue- and a red-emitting AgNC depending on the
addition of H2O2 or NaBH4.

In this work, we investigated a DNA sequence that supports a switchable
green- and red-emissive DNA-AgNC. The sequence of the 22-base DNA
strand, 5′-TTC CCA CCC ACC CCG GCC CGT T-3′, was previously
reported by Copp et al.21 Although originally
described to stabilize a red-emitting DNA-AgNC that can be purified
and isolated by HPLC, we noticed that prolonged storage led to a conversion
of this red emitter into a green emitter (see Figure S1). This observation inspired us to study the conversion
in more detail.

Our investigation shows that 5′-TTC CCA
CCC ACC CCG GCC
CGT T-3′ can stabilize a red and a green emitter, and the switching
between the two clusters can be triggered by the addition of H2O2 or NaBH4. Additionally, a number
of nonfluorescent intermediate and “over-reduced” species
are formed, limiting full reversibility between the two emitters.
Understanding of the mechanistic details behind the conversion could
lead to the development of ratiometric redox probes based on DNA-AgNCs.
Besides investigating the conversion between the red- and the green-emissive
DNA-AgNCs, we fully characterized the photophysical properties of
both emitters.

Experimental Section
Material and Methods
Synthesis
The synthesis of DNA-AgNCs was performed
using a one-pot method. First, hydrated ss-DNA (5′-TTC CCA
CCC ACC CCG GCC CGT T-3′, IDT) was mixed with AgNO3 (>99.998%, Fluka Analytical) in a solution of 10 mM ammonium
acetate
(NH4OAc) in nuclease-free water (IDT). After 15 min, NaBH4 (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to reduce the silver cations.
In the final solution, the concentration ratio of [DNA]/[AgNO3]/[NaBH4] was 20 μM:200 μM:100 μM.
The sample was stored in the fridge overnight and then upconcentrated
using spin filtration (Amicon Ultra-2 Centrifugal Filter Unit with
Ultracel-3 membrane) before injection in the HPLC system. After HPLC
purification, the sample was solvent-exchanged by spin filtration
into 10 mM NH4OAc pH = 7. The NH4OAc solution
guarantees a good chemical stability of the DNA-AgNCs over time.22

HPLC Purification
The HPLC purification
was performed
using a preparative HPLC system from Agilent Technologies with a Kinetex
column (5 μm, 100 Å, 50 × 4.6 mm) with the C18 stationary
phase. The HPLC instrument is equipped with absorption (Agilent Technologies
1100 series) and fluorescence (Agilent Technologies 1260 infinity)
detectors. The mobile phase was a gradient mixture of 35 mM triethylammonium
acetate (TEAA) in methanol and water. The gradient was varied from
20 to 95% TEAA in methanol in 19 minutes. In the time range 2–17
min, the gradient flow was linear: from 20 to 35% TEAA in methanol.
The run was followed by 6 min of washing with 95% TEAA in methanol.
The flow rate was 1.3 mL/min. The purification was based on the absorbance
signal at 570 nm, that corresponds to the absorption of the red-emissive
DNA-AgNC.

Even though there are two main peaks in the 570 nm
chromatogram (Figure S2A), the fraction
that was collected was the one that eluted around 13 min (31% TEAA
in methanol). This is because the content of the green emitter is
lower at this retention time.

Steady-State Absorption
and Emission Spectroscopy
The
absorption measurements were carried out on a Cary 300 UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) and a Lambda1050 instrument
from PerkinElmer using a deuterium lamp for ultraviolet radiation
and a halogen lamp for visible and NIR.

Steady-state fluorescence
measurements were performed using QuantaMaster400 from PTI/HORIBA
with a xenon arc lamp as the excitation source. All fluorescence spectra
were corrected for the wavelength dependency of the detector system.

Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting
Time-resolved
fluorescence and anisotropy measurements were performed using the
FluoTime300 instrument from PicoQuant with 470 nm (LDH-P-C-470) and
560 nm (LDH-D-TA-560) lasers as excitation sources for the green and
the red emitter, respectively.

Acquisition and Analysis
of Time-Resolved Emission Spectra Data
Time-resolved emission
spectra (TRES) were acquired by increasing
the emission monochromator in steps of 5 nm, with an integration time
of 30 s per decay in order to achieve at least 10 000 counts in the
maximum at the emission maximum. The analysis of time-resolved data
was performed with Fluofit v.4.6 from PicoQuant. All decays were fitted
globally with a triexponential reconvolution model including scattered
light contribution and the IRF (instrument response function). The
obtained TRES were corrected for the detector efficiency and transformed
to wavenumber units by multiplying with the Jacobian factor (λ
= 107/ν2).23 TRES were interpolated with a spline function using the built-in
spaps MATLAB function with a tolerance of 10–10 (forcing
the interpolated curve to go through the data points). The curve was
interpolated using wavenumber steps equivalent to 0.01 nm wavelength
steps. The emission maxima were taken as the maxima of the interpolated
TRES. The average decay time ⟨τ⟩ of every decay
was calculated as the intensity-weighted average lifetime. The intensity-weighted
lifetime ⟨τω⟩ was calculated
as the average of ⟨τ⟩ over the emission spectra
weighted by the steady-state intensity.13

Acquisition and Analysis of Time-Resolved Anisotropy Data
Time-resolved anisotropy measurements were carried out by exciting
the sample with vertically polarized light and acquiring both vertically
and horizontally polarized fluorescence intensity decays. The decays
were fitted by Fluofit v.4.6 from PicoQuant. A triexponential and
a monoexponential reconvolution model were used, respectively, for
the lifetime and the rotational correlation time (θ), including
the IRF. The Perrin equation24 θ
= ηV/kBT, where η is the dynamic viscosity of the solvent, V is the hydrodynamic volume of the species, and kBT is the product between the
Boltzmann constant and the absolute temperature, allowed us to calculate
the hydrodynamic volume for both red and green emitters. In the Perrin
model, the investigated species are assumed spherical for simplicity.

Results and Discussion
After synthesis, the DNA-AgNCs
were HPLC-purified (see Figure S2). The
main fraction, that elutes around
13 min, usually contains a large amount of red emitter and a minor
content of green emitter. The red emitter is characterized by an absorption
maximum at 573 nm and an emission maximum around 640 nm, whereas the
green emitter is identified by an absorption maximum at 493 nm and
an emission maximum around 560 nm (see Figure S3 for excitation and emission spectra of the two emitters).
Although it is possible to collect a fraction containing only the
red emitter by optimizing the collection time, in this work, we used
a fraction that also contains a minor amount of green emitter. The
presence of the green-emitting DNA-AgNC is not an issue because we
plan to switch back and forth between the two emitters. Moreover,
storing a pure red emitter fraction for a few months in the fridge
will lead also to the conversion of some of the red emitters to the
green emitters (see Figure S1). In the
next section, we will demonstrate the conversion of the red emitter
to the green emitter by adding the oxidizing reagent H2O2, and the recovery of the red emitter to ∼60–80%
of the original amount by addition of the reducing agent NaBH4.

Conversion Experiment
We started by preparing four
equal solutions of HPLC-purified DNA-AgNCs (containing mainly the
red emitter, see Figure S2) and we added
20 μL of H2O2 147 mM (0.5% w/V) to every
cuvette, where the concentration of DNA was 2.8 μM (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Scheme of the conversion
experiment. At time zero, 20 μL
H2O2 147 mM was added to all four cuvettes (Vtot = 2 mL). No NaBH4 was added to
cuvette 1, hence this cuvette acted as the reference for the other
cuvettes. Starting after 5 h, NaBH4 was added to cuvette
2, after 25 h to cuvette 3, and after 47 h to cuvette 4. See Figures S4–S6 for details on specific
amounts and specific times.

Figure 2A
shows
the conversion for cuvette 1 during the first day. The addition of
H2O2 promotes the switching from red to green
emitters as can be seen by the drop of the absorption peak at 573
nm and the rise of the band at 493 nm over time. One point to note
is that after 6 h, the absorption of the green emitter reaches a constant
value, while the red emitter keeps decreasing (see curves 1–4
in Figures 2A and S4 for additional spectra). In cuvettes 2, 3,
and 4, the same conversion is observed during the first 5 h (see Figure S4). The addition of 5 μL of fresh
NaBH4 1 mM to the second cuvette after 5 h recovers the
red emitter, as shown in Figure 2B. When measured immediately after the addition of
NaBH4, a minor redshift of the absorption band at 573 nm
and a longer wavelength tail are observed (see the dark blue curve
in Figures 2B and S4). We attribute the red tail around 650 nm
and the increased absorbance below 450 nm to an “over-reduction”.
However, when the same solution is measured 1 h later, the spectrum
shows the usual red emitter absorption peak (light blue curve in Figure 2B). An explanation
could be that the remaining H2O2 in the solution
removes the over-reduced species and initiates again the conversion
from red to green emitters (re-appearance of the peak at 493 nm).

day of the 3-day measurement. (A) Spectrum 1 is the starting DNA-AgNC
sample. Spectra 2, 3, and 4 correspond to the oxidized sample after
6, 8, and 10 h, respectively. (B) Selected absorption spectra of some
of the conversion steps for cuvette 2. The light red spectrum 1 is
the starting DNA-AgNC sample, while the dark red spectrum 2 is the
sample after 5 h. The dark blue 3 and light blue 4 spectra represent
the sample (after 5 h) right after the addition of 5 μL NaBH4 1 mM and 1 h later, respectively. For more spectra, see Figures S4–S6.

After the first addition of NaBH4 to cuvette 2,
additional
amounts of 5 μL NaBH4 (1 mM) were added every hour,
for the next 4 h. The additional NaBH4 improves the recoverability,
but the effect seems to level out after several additions (see Figure 3C). On the second
day, fresh NaBH4 was added to the second and third cuvettes,
and on the third day, the reducing agent was added to the second,
third, and forth cuvettes. In between the experiments, all cuvettes
were stored in the fridge (light blue dashed regions in Figure 3). All the absorption spectra
of day 1, 2, and 3 are reported in Figures S4–S6 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 3 Percent recovery of the
absorbance at 573 nm over time. The red
scatter plot represents the absorbance drop of red emitters in cuvette
1. The blue (C), yellow (B), and green (A) symbols correspond to the
absorbance changes in cuvettes 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

The results of the conversion experiment are summarized
in Figure 3, which
shows the
absorbance variation of the red emitter in every cuvette throughout
the experiment. The absorbance is expressed in percentage with respect
to the initial value, in order to highlight the recoverability of
the red emitter upon addition of NaBH4.

The red scatter
plot refers to cuvette 1 that acts as a reference
for all other cuvettes in the conversion process because no NaBH4 was added to it. The blue, yellow, and green symbols display
the evolution of the absorbance of the red emitter upon addition of
NaBH4 for cuvettes 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It is interesting
to point out that the recovery of the red emitter increases with additional
amounts of NaBH4 but levels out around 60–80% for
all the cuvettes. Another aspect to highlight is that upon prolonged
exposure to H2O2, the green emitter also starts
to disappear over time (see, e.g., the absorption peak at 493 nm in Figures S4A, S5A, and S6A).

Based on the
fact that the reversibility between the red and green
emitters can be triggered by the addition of oxidizing (H2O2) and reducing agents (NaBH4), we propose
that the origin of the difference between the red and green emitter
is mainly linked to distinct degrees of oxidation of the AgNCs embedded
in the DNA strand. However, until the mechanism of the conversion
is understood, other possible explanations cannot be excluded. Conversion
from red to green emitter can also be achieved by storage in the fridge
at 4 °C as mentioned earlier (very slow conversion, see Figure S1) or irradiation at 365 nm by the handheld
UV lamp (similar fast conversion as H2O2, see Figure S7).

Detailed inspection of the
absorption spectra indicates that besides
the prominent absorption features at 493 and 573 nm that can be assigned
to the green and red emitters, respectively, other minor absorption
characteristics are present. Initially and upon addition of NaBH4 to the green emitter, features at 390 nm and at 430 nm are
present. Both peaks drop gradually when exposed to H2O2. We speculate that these and other absorption features are
intermediate and “over-reduced” species because none
of them show up in the excitation spectrum of the green and red emitter
and are nonfluorescent (see Figures S3 and 6). This assumption could also explain why the red
emitter does not fully recover to 100% because some DNA-AgNCs might
still be present as intermediate or “over-reduced” species.

According to models proposed by Copp et al.,3 Schultz et al.,25 Petty et al.,26−28 and Huard et al.,29 DNA-AgNCs comprise
a core/group of neutral Ag atoms surrounded by Ag+ cations.
The number of neutral atoms defines the emission wavelength of the
clusters, while the Ag+ cations “glue” the
core and the DNA bases together. Copp et al. demonstrated previously
that green and red emissions tend to be linked to four and six neutral
core Ag atoms, respectively.3

Based
on mass spectrometry evidence, Copp et al. concluded that
the red emitter used in this work contains six neutral Ag0 atoms and eight Ag+ cations.21 Under the assumption that the change from the red to green emitter
is due to oxidation, we can hypothesize that the green emitter contains
four neutral Ag0 atoms.3 This
means that two Ag0 atoms from the core of the original
red emitter oxidize to Ag+. In this way, the overall number
of silver atoms and cations bound to the DNA stays constant, but the
electronic and fluorescent properties can shift in a step-wise manner
depending on the number of neutral silver atoms. This mechanism can
explain how a single oligonucleotide can stabilize different emitters.
A scheme outlining our phenomenological model can be found in Figure 4. It summarizes the
effect of H2O2 and NaBH4 on the conversion
between red and green emitters, as well as the presence of dark intermediates
and “over-reduced” species. We would like to point out
that these dark intermediates and “over-reduced” species
are ground-state species and should not be confused with the microsecond-lived
dark-excited states that the DNA-AgNCs can form.30,31 It is not unfeasible to imagine that some of the over-reduced species
could be intermediates on the way to a further red-shifted emitter
with more than 6 Ag0 atoms. However, there is no indication
that this particular DNA sequence supports a NIR emitter.

Figure 4 Schematic of
the composition of red and green emitters, as well
as the intermediate and “over-reduced” species. The
number of Ag0 atoms in the core of dark intermediates and
“over-reduced” species is unknown at this point. The
dark intermediate species and “over-reduced” species
are characterized by absorption features at 360, 390, 430 nm, around
550 nm, and a tail around 650 nm.

For simplicity, the structure proposed in Figure 4 is just a cartoon. Recent
findings have
shown that the AgNC is not necessarily organized as one continuous
spherical or rod-like unit, but it can contain regions of clustered
Ag0 atoms and regions where silver ions form a wire, promoting
base pair interactions and forcing the DNA in a specific conformation.29

To challenge our phenomenological model,
we also performed experiments
that exposed the red emitter first to additional NaBH4,
followed by the addition of H2O2. The addition
of 5 μL NaBH4 (1 mM) to freshly purified clusters
produced features in the absorption spectrum that match well with
the previously described “over-reduced” species. As
shown in Figure 5A,
the minor amount of green emitter at 493 nm disappears, while a red
shoulder at 650 nm rises, similar to Figure 2B. At the same time, two pronounced features
around 360 and 430 nm appear. Instead of the original peak from the
red emitter at 573 nm, a blue-shifted peak at 551 nm is now present.
It is interesting to point out that after 20 min, the red emitter
(peak at 573 nm) was partially restored. Further additions up to 25
μL NaBH4 (1 mM) to the solution (Figure 5B, see also Figure S8) enhance again the “over-reduced”
features (peaks at 360 and 430 nm). Intriguingly, the absorption band
close to the position of the red emitter is now even further blue-shifted
to 542 nm. Waiting for 1 h restores again the red emitter peak around
573 nm. To confirm that the treatment with NaBH4 does not
compromise the conversion capabilities to the green emitter, H2O2 was added after 1 h (see Figure 5B). The addition of the oxidizing agent fully
removed the “over-reduced” species and the green emitter
starts to re-appear (peak at 493 nm).

Figure 5 Selected absorption spectra of purified
DNA-AgNCs upon the addition
of (A) 5 μL NaBH4 1 mM and (B) 25 μL NaBH4 1 mM and further addition of 20 μL H2O2 147 mM (0.5% w/V). (For more spectra, see Figure S8). The volumes mentioned in the legend represent
the total volume added.

Based on our observations, we conclude that the oxidizing
and reducing
agents (H2O2 and NaBH4) can change
the features observed in the absorption spectrum of the DNA-AgNC.
In fact, besides the two main emitters, a number of intermediate and
“over-reduced” species can be produced, of which the
nature is not determined at this point. The intermediates and “over-reduced”
species can also explain the limited reversibility of circa 60–80%
observed in Figure 3. Because the intermediates and “over-reduced” species
are nonemissive, we will focus in the next section only on the fluorescence
properties of the red and green emitter.

Photophysical Characterization
of the Red and Green Emitter
The main spectroscopic features
of the green and red emitter are
summarized in Table 1.

Figure 6 shows the emission vs excitation 2D plots
of the two emitters. Figure 6A is the freshly HPLC-purified fraction containing mainly
the red emitter and a very small amount of green emitter, as described
above. Figure 6B displays
the data from cuvette 3, 25 h after the addition of 20 μL H2O2 147 mM. The fluorescence quantum yield of the
green emitter was determined to be 0.25, while red emitter’s
quantum yield was 0.87 at room temperature. After characterizing the
steady-state properties of the two emitting DNA-AgNCs, time-correlated
single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements were performed at room
temperature. Similar to our previous findings,22,33,34 a triexponential model was needed to satisfactorily
fit the globally linked fluorescence decay curves for both red and
green emitters. TRES were constructed from TCSPC data in the range
between the IRF limited resolution (∼150 ps) and 10 ns. The
normalized TRES for both green and red emitters, shown in Figure 7A,C, reveal a continuous
redshift of the emission spectrum during this time period. This has
been previously described and explained by a slow spectral relaxation.33,35,36 It is relevant to point out that
this relaxation is only a small part of the overall relaxation and
that the majority of the spectral relaxation, responsible for the
total Stokes shift, happens on an ultrafast timescale (<1 ps).37−40 This slow spectral relaxation, on the time scale of the fluorescence
decay time, causes the decay to become multi-exponential at fixed
emission wavelengths and leads to an increase of the average lifetime
as a function of the emission wavelength (Figure 7B,D).24

TRES and to calculate the average lifetime are reported in Figure S9. (C) TRES and (D) average decay time

DNA-AgNCs that was exposed to 20 μL H2O2 147 mM for 30 h. The oxidizing agent converted most of the red emitters
into green-emissive DNA-AgNCs. The corresponding fluorescence intensity
decays used to construct TRES and to estimate the average decay time
are reported in Figure S10.

exposed to 20 μL H2O2 147 mM for 30 h.

b Every measurement reported
for the
red emitter was carried out on the pure fraction in 10 mM NH4OAc.

c The average decay
time is weighted
by the intensity over the whole emission range.

d The emission maximum shift is determined
from the IRF-limited resolution (∼150 ps) to 10 ns.

e Fluorescence quantum yield at 25
°C. Fluorescein in NaOH 0.1 M was used as a reference for the
green emitter, while cresyl violet in pure ethanol was the reference
dye for the red emitter.32 The quantum
yield of the green emitter was determined by measuring the naturally
oxidized nanoclusters after 1.5 month storage in the fridge.

The average decay time of the green
emitter is 1.75 ns, much shorter
than the fluorescence lifetime of the red emitter that equals to 2.95
ns. The spectral relaxation in the time window accessible by our TCSPC
equipment is larger for the green emitter (450.63 cm–1) than for the red emitter (226.11 cm–1). In order
to rule out large DNA conformational changes or multiple strand interactions
as the cause of the conversion between the red and green emitters,
we determined the hydrodynamic volume of both emitters by measuring
the time-resolved anisotropy at various temperatures: 5, 15, and 25
°C. It was previously shown by Petty et al. that the hybridization
of DNA-AgNC with complementary DNA strands can convert certain AgNCs
into other ones (more specifically dark species into emissive species).41−45 The interaction between two or more DNA strands would likely have
a measurable impact on the hydrodynamic volume.

Fitting the
anisotropy decay curves (Figures S11 and S12) yielded rotational correlation times (θ)
that allowed us to calculate the hydrodynamic volumes (V) of the red and the green emitter to be 12.48 and 12.96 nm3, respectively (see Figure S13). These
values support the conclusion that the two emissive DNA-AgNCs are
similar in size and that the conversion is not due to changes in the
number of DNA strands stabilizing the two emitters, but, for example,
due to a change in the oxidation state of some of the Ag atoms. However,
minor DNA conformation changes during the conversion between the red
and green emitters cannot be excluded.

Conclusions
In
summary, we demonstrated that the DNA strand 5′-TTC CCA
CCC ACC CCG GCC CGT T-3′ can stabilize a red and a green emitter
and the conversion between them is possible. The switching from red
to green emitter can be triggered by the addition of H2O2, while the opposite conversion is caused by the addition
of NaBH4. Moreover, a number of dark intermediate and “over-reduced”
species were observed. The presence of these species seems to limit
the conversion between red- and green-emissive DNA-AgNCs to about
60–80%. We speculate that this switching is caused by an oxidation/reduction
of some silver atoms. Furthermore, we characterized the photophysical
properties of the two emitters and showed that they have very similar
hydrodynamic volumes, indirectly supporting the oxidation/reduction
model. Because of the limited number of redox-sensitive ratiometric
fluorophores, further studies of this and other switchable DNA-AgNCs
could result in the development of new probes. Additionally, our work
might also contribute in the understanding of the optical properties
of AgNCs stabilized in other matrices, for example, zeolites.46−48
