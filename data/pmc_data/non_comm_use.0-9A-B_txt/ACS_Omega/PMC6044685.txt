Cerasomes (CS), evolved
from liposomes, are novel drug-delivery
systems that have potential medical application as carriers for drugs
or active ingredients. Although many
studies have been conducted on the pharmaceutical and physicochemical
properties of CS, the role of CS in influencing the in vivo plasma
and topical pharmacokinetics and efficacy of topical drug delivery
remain unclear. In this context, we chose cryptotanshinone (CTS) as
a model drug for the preparation of CTS-CS by means of the ethanol
injection method to investigate their in vitro/in vivo drug-release
behavior and in vivo efficacy. (1) In in vitro studies, CTS-CS gel
was proven to be capable of achieving a higher permeation rate and
significant accumulation in the dermis of isolated rat skin using
Franz diffusion cells. (2) In
in vivo studies, microdialysis experiments used to measure the plasma
and topical pharmacokinetics demonstrated that the CS had a high drug
concentration, short peak time, and slow elimination. Meanwhile, the
plasma area under the concentration–time curve of CTS-CS gel
was less than half that for the CTS gel in 12 h, which indicates that
the drug bioavailability dramatically increased in the experiments.
(3) In in vivo efficacy studies, we duplicated a rat acne model and
performed antiacne efficacy experiments. The CTS-CS gel improved the
antiacne efficacy compared to that of ordinary CTS gel. Moreover,
it inhibited the expression of interleukin-1α and androgen receptors
effectively. All of these results show
that CTS-CS gel has significant potential for the treatment of acne
induced by inflammation and excessive secretion of androgen, suggesting
that CS formulations were designed as a good therapeutic option for
skin disease.

Introduction
Cerasomes (CS), mainly
consisting of ceramide, phospholipid, cholesterol,
and other components, are a new type of drug-delivery system evolved
from liposomes, which have a low toxicity and are highly biocompatible.1−5 As compared with conventional liposomes, CS, when applied externally,
tend to dissolve and penetrate into the stratum corneum (SC) cells
because of their high affinity for keratin.6,7 When
encapsulating drugs or active ingredients as a carriers, CS can improve
the stability of the inclusions. Besides, hair-follicle-targeting
provides the advantage of CS concentrating the majority of the drug
on the hair follicle disease lesions,8 thus
making it highly effective, with fewer side effects. Although substantial
research on the physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of CS
have been conducted, only a few studies have been conducted on their
plasma and topical pharmacokinetics and in vivo efficacy as well as
specific topical applications.9

Cryptotanshinone
(CTS), a lipophilic compound produced by Radix Salvia
miltiorrhiza, shows strong activity in microcirculation
improvement, inflammation resolution, skin lesion repair, and other
aspects of treatment of skin diseases.10 Clinically, CTS has a remarkable effect in treating inflammatory
and pustular acne.11 The major factors limiting
the use of CTS are its low solubility in aqueous solvents, light instability,
and induced effect on hepatic enzymes. In this context, considering
the limitations of CTS and advantages of CS, we envisioned using CS
as carriers of CTS to enhance the drug biocompatibility and prevent
the undesirable side effects of the drug.

Recently, we have
reported the in vitro skin-permeation behavior
and in vivo microdialysis by skin-targeted delivery of paeonol from
its microsponge formulation.12 Building
on these precedents, we initiated a research program with the aim
of evaluating the topical delivery system CTS-CS in terms of in vitro
drug release, in vivo pharmacokinetics, and in vivo efficacy for topical
therapy of acne. Herein, we report the first example of the preparation
and assessment of a new topical delivery system for topical therapy
of acne. In this article, a systematic study was conducted to investigate
the in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
CTS-CS gel. To reflect the advantages of the CTS-CS formulation compared
with the ordinary CTS formulation in permeation and drug retention,
we studied the effects of the CS formulation on the drug by carrying
out a skin-permeation test using a Franz diffusion cell. Meanwhile,
the differences in the plasma and local pharmacokinetics and the in
vivo efficacy of the two formulations were studied as well, to illustrate
the advantages of CS in topical administration and their good application
prospects in the treatment of skin diseases.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
of CTS-CS and Their Gel Formulation
The
shape and morphology of CTS-CS on microscopic scales were investigated
by transmission electron microscopy after negative staining, which
are shown in Figure 1. The CS were spherical closed vesicles with a single-layer or multilayer
phospholipid membrane outside and the drug packaged inside.

Figure 1 Transmission
electron microscopy image of the formed CS (original
magnification 40 000×).

The loading efficiency was calculated according to eq
1 (see details in the Supporting Information). The encapsulation efficiency of the CTS-CS was 59.90 ± 1.75%
(n = 3). The volume of the CTS-CS
was determined from a particle size distribution map, which showed
the particle size and distribution, determined by the laser light-scattering
technique. The average particle size was 119.53 ± 13.85 nm and
the coefficient of dispersion was 0.25 ± 0.025. The dispersibility
of the liposomes containing water-soluble ceramide was maintained
for at least 2 months.

Previous
experiments had been carried out for correlation with the formation
of CTS-CS. A central composite rotatable design based on the response
surface methodology was employed to design and formulate an appropriate
CTS-CS formulation. Therefore, parameters such as the membrane material
content, ratio of drug to lipid, and temperature were chosen as key
variables to evaluate the effects on the loading efficiency and sorting
coefficient. It has been well documented that the membrane material
content determines the loading efficiency, whereas the membrane material
content, ratio of drug to lipid, or correlation of the temperature
and membrane material content determines the sorting coefficient.

CS with a high entrapping efficiency and small particle size could
be prepared by the ethanol injection method, which is applied easily,
and the formed CS showed a more stable morphology compared with those
prepared by the filming-rehydration method, reverse evaporating method,
or by other methods.

We had studied on the screening for the
base of gel carbomer.12 The formed CTS-CS
gel was smooth,
uniform, had no obvious bubbles, and was easily applied, with appropriate
stickiness. The measured content of CTS in the CS gel was 102.70 μg/g,
and in the ordinary gel, it was 102.54 μg/g. During the experiment,
the gel showed no deterioration, such as rancidity, stratification,
or discoloration.

In Vitro Drug Release and Drug Deposition
Studies of CS
Figure 2 shows the
in vitro release profiles of CTS-CS gel, CTS gel, and a saturated
aqueous solution. On the basis of the percutaneous
cumulative penetration curves, the in vitro release profiles of the
CTS-CS and CTS gels could be best explained by zero-order kinetics,
as the cumulative drug release versus time was found to be linear
(R2 = 0.994). The permeation rates of
the CTS-CS and CTS gels were 4.0968 ± 0.22 and 3.0550 ±
0.21 μg/cm2 h, respectively. Compared with the CTS
gel and saturated aqueous solution, the CS formulation could significantly
increase the permeation rate of CTS. The curve of the CTS-CS gel showed
sustained release for up to 12 h. These advantages of drug release
were probably attributed to the size (119.53 ± 13.85 nm) and
uniformity (dispersion coefficient, 0.25 ± 0.025) of the CS prepared
by the ethanol injection method. Furthermore, the high affinity
for keratin and moisturizing function of ceramide may be associated
with the behavior of drug release with reduced transepidermal water
loss/increased hydration of the SC, consequently leading to increased
drug penetration into the skin.17,18

Figure 2 In vitro drug-release
studies of CTS-CS gel (0.01%, 1 g) and CTS
gel (0.01%, 1 g). All data are presented as means ± SD (n = 3).

High-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) analysis was used
to determine the amount of CTS deposited in the skin from different
formulations over different time intervals (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 3 and Table S4,
the contents of CTS deposited in the skin at four time points was
higher when the CTS-CS gel was applied compared to that when the CTS
gel was applied, especially at 4 h (0.27 ± 0.001 vs 0.50 ±
0.03 μg/cm2) and 12 h (0.60 ± 0.038 vs 0.88
± 0.106 μg/cm2). The deposition of CTS
from the CS gel at the same dose was the highest after 24 h, showing
that the CS gel improved drug delivery to the skin. Thus, the larger
amount of drug deposition in the skin from the CTS-CS gel might be
indicative of a greater efficacy in the topical area.

Figure 3 Ex vivo drug deposition
studies of CTS-CS (0.01%, 1 g) and CTS
(0.01%, 1 g) gels. All data are presented as means ± SD (n = 3).

During the first
4 h, the drug retention of the two preparations in skin was significantly
different, indicating that the CTS-CS gel released a higher amount
of the drug into the skin; however, their penetration rates were equivalent.
From 4 h to 8 h, the permeation rates of CTS-CS gel gradually increased
which led to no significantly retention of drug in the skin compared
to CTS gel. Over 8–12 h, the permeation rates of the
CTS-CS gel continued to rise and there were significant differences
in the skin retention of the drug, which were probably due to a drug
reservoir formed by the CTS-CS gel in the skin until subsequent elimination.
Nevertheless, the mechanism of drug release from CS is not clear.

It is known that skin permeability varies across animal species,
and it is usually higher for animals with a high hair-follicle density.19 The in vitro permeation study through rat skin
was consistent with the animal chosen in pharmacokinetics study for
convenience operation of microdialysis and in vivo efficacy study
for acne modeling.

Influence of CS on the Pharmacokinetics
In vivo recovery
rates (RRs) were estimated according to the retrodialysis method,15 which relies on the assumption that diffusion
through the semipermeable membrane is quantitatively equal in both
directions. Thus, the compound of interest can be added to the perfusion
medium and the disappearance rate through the membrane can be taken
as the in vivo RR. The average recovery of CTS detected by the retrodialysis
method was 51.83 ± 1.68% (n = 6) at the intradermal
site and 51.52 ± 0.97% (n = 6) at the vein site.
There was no significant
statistical difference between the recoveries detected at the two
sites of probe insertion (P = 0.734). The dialysis
membrane showed a steady loss of CTS in the subcutaneous tissue fluid
and in blood through the probe within the sampling time, confirming
that recovery was consistent and reproducible.

The calibrated concentrations
of free CTS intradermally and in the blood dialysate after topical
treatment with CTS-CS and CTS gels over time are shown in Figure 4. The pharmacokinetic
parameters estimated are reported in Table S5. Next, we compared the concentration–time profiles of the
CTS-CS and CTS gels after dermal administration to rats. The area
under the
concentration–time curve (AUC0–t), the time to peak concentration, and t1/2 in the intradermal fluid for the CTS-CS gel were 27.99
± 0.89 μg/mL h, 3.67 h, and 9.90 h, respectively, and for
the CTS gel, they were 19.18 ± 0.62 μg/mL h, 9.17 h, and
5.44 h, respectively. The t1/2 value for
the CTS-CS gel was twice that for the CTS gel, and there was a significant
difference (P < 0.01) between the AUC0–t values of the two preparations. The AUC0–t and Cmax values of the
CTS-CS gel in blood were less than half those of the CTS gel (3.31
± 0.27 vs 9.39 ± 0.38 μg/mL h and 0.45 ± 0.09
vs 1.36 ± 0.19 μg/mL, respectively), and all pharmacokinetic
parameters of the two groups were significantly different (P < 0.05).

Figure 4 Concentrations of CTS in the intradermal liquid
and plasma for
the CTS-CS and CTS gels were detected by microdialysis. All data are
presented as means ± SD (n = 3).

The CTS-CS gel had the following characteristics
compared with
the ordinary gel: a higher drug concentration, a shorter peak time,
slower elimination, and less drug release into systemic circulation.
The absorption rate of CTS was significantly higher on application
of the CTS-CS gel compared to that on application of the CTS gel,
as observed in Figure 4, which is in accordance with in vitro drug-release studies. The
ability of CS
to dissolve and penetrate into SC cells due to their unique lipid
composition, which is similar to that of the SC, may lead to the faster
penetration of CTS. A good distribution of the drug in the dermis
allows the dose to be lowered and the formation of a drug reservoir
within the upper layers of the SC, leading to concentration of the
drug at the disease site, shown by the contrasting AUC0–t values in the subcutaneous liquid. Likewise, slower
elimination of CTS shows the capacity of the CS to release the drug
slowly and maintain a stable epidermal residue concentration for a
long time.19 Meanwhile, the lower measured
values of AUC0-t and Cmax for CTS-CS gel in blood showed significant compared
to CTS gel, resulted in reduced side effects.

Regarded as a
dermal-delivery formulation, the drugs encapsulated
in the CS should stay in the treated areas, and absorption to other
areas should be minimized. In summary,
in vivo pharmacokinetic studies show that the CTS-CS gel can actually
improve the local bioavailability, reduce the side effects, and prolong
the release time of the drug, which may lead to the retention of effective
concentrations of the drug in the skin for a long time. The results
show that preparing CTS as a CS formulation may be promising for treatment
of skin diseases, like acne.

The low recoveries of drugs with
large molecular weights, high
lipophilicity, or high protein-binding rates limit the application
of the microdialysis method.20 On the basis
of previous research,12 microdialysis was
proven to be an appropriate method for CTS (1.78 of oil–water
partition coefficient, 166.18 of molecular weight, 46.16 ± 9.02
of protein-binding rate). To determine the appropriate perfusate for
CTS, the solubility of CTS in different solvents was studied. The
solubility of CTS
in distilled water was low, as well as in normal saline and phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solution of different pH, but 18.23 μg/mL in normal
saline (containing 20% poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-400) which can
be used as the perfusate of CTS.

There is controversy regarding
the influence of the actual position
of implantation of the probe on recovery and sample collection. Different
depths of the probe in the dermis may influence the drug content in
the intradermal fluid. At present, no appropriate instrumentation
is available for measurement of the probe depth. Fartasch
et al. have reported that if the probes are inserted by the same well-trained
person, nearly consistent depths can be achieved.21 Simonsen et al. found that there was no significant correlation
between the probe depth and drug concentration at a depth of 0.7–1.1
mm.22 In this study, the stainless needle
was consistently inserted into the dermis by the same person in such
a way that the needle was clearly visible through the superficial
skin layer to make sure that the depth of the probe was not greater
than 2 mm, which corresponds to the depth of the deep dermis.23

In Vivo Efficacy of the CTS-CS Gel
Histology
Histological analyses were
performed to assess the remission and improvement of symptoms of acne
after treatment with the CTS-CS or CTS gel, compared to those in the
positive control group and the blank matrix group. The results are
present in Figure 5. Compared
with the normal group, the model group showed infiltration of inflammatory
cells throughout the superficial dermis and excessive secretions from
and a high density of distribution of the sebaceous glands; in addition,
it showed hyperemia and tissue edema around the follicle roots. After
dermal administration of the CTS-CS gel for 2 weeks, only very few
inflammatory cells could be found in the CS group. The morphologies
of the hair follicles
and sebaceous glands returned to normal, that is, those in the positive
control group. On treatment with the CTS gel, less secretion from
and loose arrangement of the sebaceous glands were observed in the
sectioned samples, but lots of inflammatory cells and congested pores
still existed. There was little symptomatic improvement in the blank
matrix group, indicating that the matrix had no effect on the results.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
The observation and judgment
of slice: positive expression of membrane and showing stained brown
granules in the cytoplasm, the deeper the color, the stronger expression,
no appearance of brown particles is negative. The average density
quantization is summarized in Figures 6–8 and Table S6, compared with rats in the
normal group, acne model rats showed a significant increase (P < 0.01) in the number of cells positive for interleukin
(IL)-1α and androgen receptors (ARs). Both the CTS-CS and CTS
gels reduced the number of positive cells, but the CS and the positive
control group showed a significant reduction (P <
0.05) in the expression IL-1α, whereas only the CS group showed
a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in AR expression.

Western Blotting for the
Expression of IL-1α and AR
Western blotting analysis
of the tissue extracts was conducted
to directly detect the IL-1α and AR contents in the rat skin.
As shown in Figure 9, the IL-1α and AR bands for the model group were apparently
darker than those for the normal group. Compared with mice in the
normal group, mice in the model group showed significant increases
(P < 0.01) in the expression of IL-1α and
AR expressions in the skin. In the case
of IL-1α, compared with the blank matrix group, the IOD of the
CS group was the lowest compared to other three administrated groups,
and had a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in contrast
with the general group. The expression of the AR band showed the same
trend among these groups, as shown in Figure 9 and Table S8.

The rat model of acne, induced
by continuous smear of 100% oleic
acid, was successfully prepared. The replication of animal model
performances are shown in the following aspects: the thickening, hardening
of local tissue in dorsal skin of rats, the red papules caused by
ridges of hair follicle. From a subjective point of view, the amount
of acne and roughness of the rat skin greatly improved after dermal
administration of CTS-CS gel. Nevertheless, the differences among
the six groups must be reflected in a more intuitive and subjective
manner, such as through graphs and data. Hence, HE staining and immunohistochemical
pathologies were used to observe the morphological changes in the
rat epidermis and dermis and the positive expression of IL-1α
and ARs, respectively. In addition, western blotting was
also adopted for semiquantitative analysis of the expression of IL-1α
and ARs.

The in vivo
efficacy of the CTS-CS gel was characterized on the basis of the intensity
of IL-1α and AR positivity. IHC results showed that the model
group of IL-1α- and AR-positive cells increased significantly
in the skin, suggesting that the stimulation of oleic acid can increase
the density of expression of IL-1α- and AR-positive cells in
pilosebaceous unit, epidermis, and dermis. However, compared with
the blank matrix group, the CS and drug-positive groups showed a significant
decrease IL-1α and AR positivity, which indicated that IL-1α-
and AR-positive cells can be inhibited by the CTS-CS gel and Kecuoyintong
gel. Along with improvement of the symptoms of acne, variation in
the density of IL-1α- and AR-positive cells in back skin of
rats may also have certain connections with the formation of acne.
Western blotting detected that IL-1α and AR positivity in the
acne model group increased significantly compared to that in the blank
group, whereas CS and the drug-positive group showed a significant
decrease compared with the blank matrix group, showing that the CTS-CS
gel and drug-positive group can restrain IL-1α and AR expression
to a certain extent, which is consistent with the immunohistochemical
results.

Briefly, the studies found that the CTS-CS gel could
relieve inflammation
of the skin, as well as improve the degree of follicular keratosis
and restore normalcy in the abnormally secreting sebaceous glands
by regulating the expression of IL-1α and AR. The new preparation
played a vital role in the treatment of acne vulgaris by inhibiting
the stimulation of the male hormone in the sebaceous glands through
competitive inhibition of ARs and by reducing inflammation of the
skin through the expression of inflammatory cytokines. During animal
grouping, we set up the blank matrix group for treatment with blank
matrix gel, which showed no significant improvement after 2 weeks
of administration, in contrast to the model group, revealing that
the blank matrix in CTS-CS and ordinary gels had no effect on the
final results.

In
this research, IL-1α and AR were chosen to be the pharmacodynamic
indexes closely related to acne, as IL-1α has been proven to
be highly associated with excessive diversification of keratinocytes,
induced by direct action on the IL-1 receptor or guiding the release
of other growth factors,24,25 and the amount of AR
determined the expression of androgen, which may cause sebaceous gland
hyperplasia in the case of overexpression.26 From the viewpoint of CTS, it shows strong inflammation resolution
and antiandrogenic activities. In summary,
the above were fully illustrated the links between the two cytokines
and the efficacy of CTS-CS gel indeed. Further studies are needed
to elucidate the efficacy of the CTS-CS gel applied to acne lesions.

Conclusions
In this research, we put forward the first
example of preparation
and assessment of CTS-CS for topical therapy of acne. This study provided
several potentially useful findings on the development of CS for topical
treatment of skin diseases. First, a rapid drug permeation rate with
a higher drug deposition is more effective in local treatment at a
low dosage compared with ordinary formulations. Second, improved bioavailability
in selected sites but minimum transdermal penetration into plasma
led to fewer side effects for the same amount drug. Third, hair-follicle-targeting
is very advantageous in curing hair-follicle diseases, like acne.
These properties reveal that the CS dermal-delivery system could be
applicable in pharmaceutical and cosmetic treatments. However, the
exact mechanisms of drug distribution and drug penetration in the
skin are still unknown. Besides, models combining the pharmacokinetic
features of CS and pharmacodynamic index in therapy have not yet been
evaluated. Further efforts will focus on in-depth assessment of CS
and their formulation.

Materials and Methods
Materials
The
reference substance, CTS, was obtained
from the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and
Biological Products. PEG-400 was obtained from Tianjin Damao Chemical
Reagent Factory, China. Normal saline containing 20% PEG-400 was freshly
prepared before use. Water-soluble ceramide was obtained from Xi’an
Langhong Technology Co., Ltd., China. Soybean lecithin was purchased
from Degussa Construction Chemicals AG, Europe. Cholesterol was purchased
from Emieo-secoma Co. Oleic acid was supplied by Tianjin Fuyu Fine
Chemical Co., Ltd., China. All other reagents were of analytical grade
from Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, China, and used as received.

Animals
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (male and female,
average body weight 180–220 g, SPF grade) were purchased from
the Experimental Animal Center in Guangzhou University of Chinese
Medicine. All animals received care in compliance with the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals guidelines, and all procedures were conducted
in accordance with the guidelines and ethical rules of the Experimental
Animal Center in Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. All animals
were allowed to adapt to the experimental conditions (12 h dark/light
cycle, temperature: 20 ± 2 °C, and humidity: 60 ± 5%)
for 1 week. All surgeries were performed under 10% chloral hydrate
anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.

Analytical
System
A reverse-phase HPLC system, equipped
with a quaternary pump (both model series 1260; Agilent Technologies
Inc., Wilmington, DE), an autosampler, an online vacuum degasser,
a column temperature controller, multiple-wavelength detectors and
diode array, and an analytical workstation, was used for quantitative
determination of CTS. Chromatographic measurements were conducted
on an HPLC column, length 250 mm, 4.6 mm i.d., 5 mm particle size
(Agilent HC-C18; Agilent Technologies), using a mixture
of acetonitrile and distilled water (80:20) as the eluent (flow rate:
1 mL/min, 25 °C, wavelength: 276 nm).

Preparation of CTS-CS
CTS-CS were prepared using the
ethanol injection method, according to the procedure reported previously.13 To prepare the oil phase, CTS, cholesterol,
and soybean lecithin were dissolved in 3 mL of anhydrous ethanol. Magnetic
stirrers (C-MAG HS4, IKA, GER) were placed in the aqueous phase, which
contained water-soluble ceramide dissolved in 10 mL of PBS (0.2 M,
pH 7.4), to warm it up gradually at a temperature of 55 °C, and
stirring was performed with a stir bar at 600 rpm. Thereafter, the
oil phase was gradually injected into the stirring aqueous phase with
a syringe. Then, the mixture was stirred at 600 rpm for 3 h at room
temperature to allow the organic solvent to evaporate from the reaction
flask. The resulting suspensions were harvested as we need and stored
at −5 °C prior to use. The optimized preparation was based
on the loading efficiency and sorting coefficient (shown in the Supporting Information).

Preparation of CTS-CS Gel
and the Skin Irritation Test
The gel matrix was composed
of 2 g of carbomer, 15 g of propylene
glycol, 20 g of glycerol, and water (15 mL); it was stirred at a slow
stirring speed and had a swelling time of 5 h. A CTS-CS or CTS ethanol
solution was then added into 4 times the amount of blank matrix, while
stirring the mixture with a magnetic stirrer to ensure a homogenous
preparation, as well as dissolved
sodium sulfate anhydrous (0.2 g) and sodium hydroxide (0.2 g) with
water (10 mL), and finally added water up to 100 g. As a comparison,
we prepared a saturated solution of CTS using normal saline as a solvent.
In our study, the content of CTS in the CS and ordinary gels were
102.7 ± 0.67 and 102.54 ± 1.27 μg/g. The skin
irritation test was carried out to evaluate the applicability of the
two gels. The results showed that the two preparations caused no irritation
to the skin in domestic rabbits (see details in the Supporting Information).

In Vitro Permeation and
Drug Deposition Studies
In
vitro drug permeation studies for CTS-CS or CTS ordinary gels were
carried out using a Franz diffusion cell system, maintained at 32.0
± 1 °C by means of a circulating water bath. The receiver
chamber of the diffusion cell (15 mL; orifice area of 3.14 cm2) was filled with receiver medium (20% PEG-400–normal
saline, v/v) and stirred constantly at 300 rpm. Rat skin was used
as a permeation membrane, which was obtained from female SD rats (average
body weight 200 g, SPF grade). The back skin was excised after the
rat was euthanized, and the subcutaneous fat tissue was carefully
removed with forceps; the samples were immediately stored at −20
°C until analysis. The skin was clamped between the receptor
and donor chambers, with the SC side facing upward. The respective
formulation (CTS-CS gel, 1.0 g; CTS gel, 1.0 g; or saturated aqueous
solution, 1 mL) was gently applied to the SC side of the skin. The
skin permeation membrane samples (1 mL) were withdrawn from the receiver
compartment at 14 predetermined time points and analyzed for CTS concentration
using a validated HPLC method, as described below. A cumulative curve
of the total amount of CTS that permeated the membrane was plotted
at each time interval versus time. The release kinetics and patterns
of the CTS-CS and CTS gels were calculated or analyzed using different
mathematical modes.

For quantification of the residual amount
of drug in the skin, Franz diffusion cells were used as described
above. The three formulations (1.0 g of CTS-CS gel, 1.0 g of CTS gel,
and 1 mL of saturated aqueous solution) were administered in the donor
chamber, and the skin samples were withdrawn at designated time points
(4, 8, 12, and 24 h). After removal of the remaining gel, the skin
samples were weighed and flushed five times with 10 mL of distilled
water. The remaining CTS in the rat skin samples was extracted by
the tissue homogenate method with 5 mL of methanol. Ultimately, the
tissue samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 10 000 rpm to
obtained supernatants for HPLC analysis.

In Vivo Pharmacokinetics
Study
Female SD rats weighing
180–220 g were anesthetized with a solution of 10% chloral
hydrate administered intraperitoneally in a dose of 0.35 mL/100 g;
thereafter, supplementary injections of half the dose were given every
90 min if required. The back fur of the rats was carefully shaved
for intradermal microdialysis. Assembled by embedding a stainless
steel needle into a tubing, an introducer was settled to implement
intradermal insertion over the dermis.14 Once the needle was withdrawn, a microdialysis probe (CMA 20 Elite,
10 mm in membrane length, 20 kDa molecular cut-off; CMA Microdialysis
AB, Solna, Sweden) was inserted as a replacement, followed by removal
of the tubing and taping it to the skin with surgical tape. Meanwhile,
the jugular vein was isolated for plasma microdialysis, which was
also implanted into a probe by means of the procedure described above.
The probe was connected to a peristaltic micropump (CMA 402; CMA Microdialysis
AB, Solna, Sweden), delivering the perfusion medium (20% PEG-400–normal
saline, v/v) at a constant flow rate of 2 μL/min after placement.
After equilibration for 1 h, 1.0 g of the CTS-CS or CTS gel was applied
to an area of back skin that was 3.14 cm2 in size. A refrigerated
fraction collector (MAB 85; Microbiotech/se AB, Stockholm, Sweden)
was used to collect the intradermal and plasma dialysates for HPLC
analysis at 30 min intervals for 12 h from the same set animals at
each time point.

Prior to the pharmacokinetic analysis, in vivo
relative RRs of the probes were assessed according to the retrodialysis
method15 (shown in the Supporting Information). From the CTS concentrations calculated
after calibration, four time–concentration curves were constructed
and certain pharmacokinetic parameters were determined, including
the AUC, the maximum concentration reached (Cmax), and the time necessary to reach the maximum concentration
(tmax).

In Vivo Efficacy of the
CTS-CS Gel
Animal Grouping
SD rats (half male and female; average
body weight, 200 g; SPF grade) were divided into the normal group,
model group, positive control group, CS group, general group, and
blank matrix group (six each) by the sortition randomization method.

Acne Model Replication
The back fur of the rats was shaved
carefully with an electrical animal hair clipper.16In
addition to the normal group, 100% oleic acid (0.5 mL) was smeared
onto the rat skin evenly over a depilating area of 4 cm2 once a day for 2 weeks. The normal group was treated with normal
saline in the same volume.

Dermal Administration
When the acne
model was successfully
prepared, five of the groups received topical administration of Kecuoyintong
gel, CTS-CS gel, CTS gel, and blank matrix gel (0.5/100 g, once a
day) over the affected areas, excluding the model group.

After
administration for 2 weeks consecutively, we observed and evaluated
the macroscopic lesions of skin acne. Under anesthesia, all skin samples
were cut at full thickness from the administration sites; they were
then were used for histological analyses or frozen in liquid nitrogen
immediately and maintained at −80 °C for molecular and
protein analyses. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation.

Histology
The skin samples collected
were fixed in
4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4), dehydrated with
a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. An RM2245 microtome
(Leica Microsystems, Switzerland) was used to section the paraffin
blocks into slices of 4 μm thickness. Thereafter, the sectioned
samples were treated in xylol to eliminate the paraffin, stained with
H&E, and finally visualized under an optical microscope (objective
100×). Analysis of the pathological sections included
study of the following markers relevant to acne: infiltration of superficial
dermal inflammatory cells, hyperemia, and tissue edema around the
follicle roots and sebaceous gland.

IHC
To study the
behavior of acne during model replication
and dermal administration, two markers related to acne, that is, IL-1α
and AR, were assessed for by IHC. They were quantified using IL-1α
and AR antibody detection kits following the manufacturer’s
instructions (shown in the Supporting Information). Images were acquired with an optical microscope (LV100D; Nikon,
Japan) to observe positive staining, indicated by brown staining.
The IOD and distribution of positive expression were measured using
live imaging software, and they were then statistically analyzed.

Western Blotting Analysis
An anti-rat IL-1α western
blotting kit and an anti-rat AR western blotting kit were used to
quantify the indexes, following the manufacturer’s instructions
(shown in the Supporting Information).
An automatic image analytic system was then used to semiquantify the
relative contents of the two pharmacodynamic indexes (the gray value
of the image).

Statistical Analysis
Data are presented
as means ±
SD. Statistical significance among the experimental groups was evaluated
by one-way Student’s t-tests or ANOVA. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant,
and a p-value less than 0.01 was considered highly
significant.
