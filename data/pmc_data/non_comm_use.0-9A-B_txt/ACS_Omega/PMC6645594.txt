The
new hybrid-type squaramide-fused amino alcohol containing both
a Brønsted basic site and hydrogen-bonding sites in the molecule
showed a high catalytic activity as an organocatalyst in the enantioselective
domino Michael addition/cyclization reaction of oxoindolines with
cyclic 1,3-diketones to afford the chiral spiro-conjugated oxindoles
featuring 2-aminopyrans fusing with carbo-heterocyclic ring systems
with excellent chemical yields (up to 98%) and enantioselectivities
(up to 95% ee). The obtained chiral spiro-conjugated 2-aminopyrans
bearing quaternary stereogenic carbon center could be used as synthetic
precursors for several natural products that have a broad spectrum
of fascinating biological activities.

Introduction
In the enormously progressing
field of synthetic organic chemistry,
the construction of carbon–carbon and a carbon–heteroatom
bond is an important strategy for the construction of complex organic
molecules.1 The domino approach is one
of the major tools to construct biologically important complex molecules
and its precursors from simple substrates in one-pot fashion, which
is ecologically and economically benign.2 The enantioselective domino Michael addition/cyclization reaction
of oxoindoline with cyclic or acyclic 1,3-diketones affords the synthetically
valuable chiral carbo-heterocyclic spiro-oxindoles A,
that are synthetic intermediates for preparing many biologically active
molecules, such as rychnophylline (tetracyclic oxindole alkaloid),
formosanine (pentacyclic oxindole alkaloid), elacomine (hemiterpene
oxindole alkaloid), and pyranopyrazole (synthetic dye-stuff), in the
field of synthetic organic chemistry (Scheme 1).3−6

Scheme 1 Biological Significance of Chiral Oxindole Incorporating
Spiro-conjugated
Amino Framework
However, the methodology
of preparation of vital spiro-oxindole A, incorporating
a chiral spiro-conjugated aminopyran framework
at C-3 position of oxindoles, is still limited. Recently, Yuan and
his co-workers7 reported the first enantioselective
domino Michael addition/cyclization reaction of oxoindolines B with acyclic 1,3-diketones C using cupreine
(CPN) organocatalyst to afford chiral spiro-conjugated oxindoles with
2-aminopyrans framework E in both excellent chemical
yield (up to 99%) and enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee) (Scheme 2). However, this
CPN catalyst did not work efficiently for the reaction of cyclic 1,3-diketones D with oxoindolines to afford the chiral spiro-conjugated
oxindoles F with 2-aminopyrans fusing carbo-heterocyclic
ring systems at C-4 and C-5 positions in terms of enantioselectivity
(up to 8% ee), in spite of the obtained products being useful for
the synthesis of biologically important molecules from the point of
view of drug discovery.8

Scheme 2 Cupreine-Catalyzed
Enantioselective Domino Michael Addition/Cyclization
Most recently, we developed the new hybrid-type
squaramide-fused
amino alcohol (SFAA) organocatalysts and the catalyst was successfully
employed in enantioselective nitro-aldol and Diels–Alder reactions
to afford the corresponding synthetically important chiral products
in satisfactory chemical yields and enantioselectivities.9 On the basis of these reasons, we planned to
apply our newly developed SFAA organocatalyst for enantioselective
domino Michael addition/cyclization reaction of oxoindolines with
cyclic 1,3-diketones, affording the chiral spiro-conjugated oxindoles
with 2-aminopyrans fusing with carbo-heterocyclic ring systems.

The SFAA organocatalyst possesses multiple functional sites, such
as diamino groups on squaramide part for hydrogen-bonding with the
substrate, tertiary amino group acting as a Brønsted base, and
phenyl groups acting as steric influence site for recognition by substrates
(Scheme 3). The enantioselective
domino Michael addition/cyclization reaction of oxoindolines with
cyclic 1,3-diketones using SFAA catalyst might proceed via transition
state X, in which the hydroxy functional group on catalysts
might participate in hydrogen-bonding interaction with squaramide
carbonyl oxygen atom. Additionally, the enolate of cyclic 1,3-diketones
might be fixed through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the ammonium
site at the side chain of the catalyst part. Furthermore, two cyano
groups of oxoindoline might be fixed through two hydrogen-bonding
interactions with two amino hydrogen atoms of the squaramide unit
of the catalyst. The activated enolate generated from 1,3-diketones
might attack stereoselectively on electron-deficient olefin on oxoindolines
from the less sterically hindered site of the fixed oxoindoline to
afford the chiral Michael adduct, and subsequent intramolecular cyclization/tautomerization
might afford the corresponding chiral spiro-conjugated oxindoles with
2-aminopyrans fusing carbo-heterocyclic ring systems in satisfactory
chemical yield and enantioselectivity.

Scheme 3 Concept of Domino
Michael Addition/Cyclization Reaction of Oxoindolines
with Cyclic 1,3-Diketones Using SFAA Organocatalyst
We report herein that the first domino Michael
addition/cyclization
reaction of cyclic 1,3-diketones with oxoindolines using SFAA catalyst
afforded the chiral spiro-conjugated oxindoles with 2-aminopyrans
fusing carbo-heterocyclic ring systems in excellent chemical yields
(up to 98%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95% ee),
although cupreine catalyst only afforded the spiro products in poor
enantioselectivities (up to 8% ee) when cyclic 1,3-diketones were
used.

Results and Discussion
The catalysts 3a–e with different
sizes of heterocyclic ring systems on the amino alcohol part were
easily prepared according to our previously reported method using
the condensation of squaramide with amino alcohols.9 At the outset of the study, the domino Michael addition/cyclization
reaction of oxoindolines 1a,b with dimedone 2a was tried using SFAA catalysts 3a–e (10 mol %) in toluene or tetrahydrofuran (THF). The results
are summarized in Table 1. First, the reaction using catalyst 3a (10 mol %) was
conducted with oxoindoline 1a and dimedone 2a in toluene at room temperature (RT) for 24 h but only a trace amount
of desired spiro-pyran 4a was obtained (entry 1). Next,
the reactions using catalysts 3b and 3c were
also carried out, respectively, and the corresponding 4a was afforded in good chemical yields (3b: 82%, 3c: 90%) but with poor enantioselectivities (3b: 7% ee, 3c: 9% ee) (entries 2 and 3). Furthermore,
the reaction using catalyst 3b was also conducted in
THF (polar aprotic solvent) but the reaction only afforded 4a as racemate, although good chemical yield (90%) was obtained (entry
4). On the basis of these results, we assumed that the use of sterically
bulkier oxoindolines might be effective to control the enantioselectivity
in this reaction.

high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using CHIRALCEL OD-H

The reaction of bulkier N-Bn-oxoindoline 1b with 2a using catalyst 3b was
carried out in toluene. Unfortunately, this reaction also afforded
the racemic 4b, although the chemical yield was excellent
(95%) (entry 5). Moreover, the same reaction using 3b was examined in THF. Surprisingly, the enantioselectivity was greatly
increased to 77% ee with good chemical yield (89%) (entry 6). The
reaction using 3a was also carried out in the same reaction
conditions as those of 3b. Similarly, the catalyst 3a showed good catalytic activity to afford 4b in excellent chemical yield (92%) and with good enantioselectivity
(79% ee) (entry 7). Furthermore, the use of catalyst 3c was also examined to afford the chiral 4a in excellent
chemical yield (95%) with good enantioselectivity (75% ee) (entry
8). Encouraged by the results using THF as a solvent, the reactions
using catalysts 3d and 3e were also carried
out in THF, respectively. However, the reaction afforded 4b in poor enantioselectivities (entries 9 and 10). Furthermore, this
reaction of 1b with 2a using well-known
quinine G and diamine squaramide H catalysts
was examined (entries 11 and 12), respectively. As a result, catalyst G afforded 4b in both good chemical yield (86%)
and enantioselectivity (70% ee) (entry 11). On the other hand, catalyst H provided 4b in excellent chemical yield (91%)
but with poor enantioselectivities (24% ee) (entry 12). By these results,
it was found that catalyst 3a possessing pyrrolidine
ring was the most effective in this reaction of 1b with 2a.

To optimize the reaction conditions using superior
catalyst 3a, we next examined the molar ratio of catalyst,
the effect
of solvents, and the reaction temperatures (Table 2, entries 1–15). An increase in the
catalyst loading amount from 10 to 20 mol % 3a resulted
in a remarkable increase in chemical yield (96%) and unpredicted decrease
in enantioselectivity (7% ee), although the reason was not clear (entry
1). On the other hand, the catalytic loading of 5 mol % 3a brought about both increase of chemical yield (95%) and enantioselectivity
(83%) (entry 2). Furthermore, the reaction was also tried in the presence
of 2 mol % 3a to afford the chiral product 4b in excellent chemical yield (92%) with good enantioselectivity (81%
ee) (entry 3). To further improve the enantioselectivity of 4b, we also examined the catalytic activity of 3a at low temperatures (−10 to −80 °C). Under these
conditions, good enantioselectivities (73–81% ee) were obtained
with fairly good chemical yields (87–92%) (entries 4–6).
Next, we examined the effects of different ethereal solvents, such
as diethyl ether (Et2O), diisopropyl ether (DIPE), and
1,4-dioxane in this reaction using 5 mol % 3a. From the
results, the enantioselectivities widely decreased in these solvents,
although the chemical yields were good to excellent (entries 7–9).
Moreover, the reactions were carried out in chlorinated solvents,
such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform, and 1,2-dichloroethane
(DCE). However, the chiral 4b was obtained in good-to-excellent
chemical yield (89–96%) and only poor-to-moderate enantioselectivities
(7–51% ee) (entries 10–12). Similarly, the uses of highly
polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide
(DMA), and MeOH, also afforded racemic 4b with good chemical
yields (89–92%) (entries 13–15). From these results,
it turned out that the use of 5 mol % 3a in THF at 0
°C for 48 h was the optimal condition for this reaction. In general,
enantiomeric excess in asymmetric reactions strongly depends on the
solvent effect. It might be reasoned that THF coordinates in the reaction
system include both the catalyst
and substrates for forming a better transition state to afford satisfactory
optical purity for this reaction.

Under the optimal
reaction conditions, the reactions using a wide
range of oxoindolines 1c–m with cyclic
1,3-diketones 2a–c were examined
in the domino Michael addition/cyclization reaction in the presence
of superior catalyst 3a to afford the corresponding chiral
spiro-conjugated 2-aminopyrans 4c–r. The results are summarized in Scheme 4. The reaction of N-para-methoxybenzyl-oxoindoline 1c with dimedone 2a afforded the corresponding spiro-pyran 4c in
both good chemical yield (89%) and enantioselectivity (81% ee). However,
the use of electron-deficient N-Boc-oxoindoline 1d gave 4d in good chemical yield (72%) but with
poor enantioselectivity (5% ee). This failure might be due to the
electronic characteristics of 1d, although the reason
is not clear. The best result (92, 95% ee) was obtained in the reaction
of N-methyl-oxoindoline 1e with 2a. The absolute configuration of the obtained chiral spiro-pyran
(3S)-4e was determined by X-ray analysis
(see the Supporting Information). The reactions
of N-ethyl and N-methoxymethyl oxoindolines 1f,g with 2a afforded the corresponding
chiral products 4f and 4g in good-to-excellent
chemical yields (4f: 87%, 4g: 95%) and with
moderate-to-good enantioselectivities (4f: 84% ee, 4g: 75% ee), respectively. Furthermore, the reactions were
also conducted using N-acetyl oxoindoline 1h or silyl-protected N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl
oxoindoline 1i with 2a, to afford the chiral
spiro-pyrans 4h,i in moderate-to-good chemical
yields (4h: 90%, 4i: 72%) and moderate-to-poor
enantioselectivities (4h: 80% ee, 4i: 9%
ee). The use of bulkier naphthyl-(2-methylene)-oxoindoline 1j also afforded the chiral 4j in good chemical yield
(81%) with enantioselectivity (71% ee). Additionally, the domino Michael
addition/cyclization reaction using N-methyl-oxoindoline 1e was extended to the reaction with other cyclic 1,3-diketones,
such as 1,3-cyclohexadione 2b and 1,3-cyclopentadione 2c, using catalyst 3a. The reaction of 1e with 2b afforded the desired product 4k in both good chemical yield and enantioselectivity (4k: 90%, 76% ee). On the other hand, the reaction between 1e and 2c afforded product 4l in
good chemical yield but with poor enantioselectivity (4l: 90%, 12% ee). The use of 5-fluoro-N-methyl-oxoindoline 1k also afforded the corresponding product 4m in both good chemical yield and enantioselectivity (4m: 72%, 71% ee).

Scheme 4 Substrate Scope for the Domino Michael Addition/Cyclization
Reaction
Using Catalyst 3a
Next, the reaction of 5-bromo-N-methyl-oxoindoline 1l with 2a was also carried out and the product 4n was obtained in excellent chemical yield with racemate,
although the reason is not clear. Similarly, the reaction of 1m with 2a also afforded the anticipated product 4o obtained as racemate but with good chemical yield (4o: 81%). We also examined the reaction of N-methyl-oxoindoline 1e with acyclic 1,3-diketones 2d–f using catalyst 3a. However,
the desired products 4p–r were obtained
as racemates, proceeded with a good chemical yield (72–81%),
respectively. The formation of racemates 4p–r may be for the unfavored interaction of substrates 2d–f with catalyst 3a, respectively,
although the reason is not clear. These results of the reactions of
acyclic 1,3-diketones 4p–r are in
contrast to the previously reported results.8 To demonstrate the practical utility of catalyst 3a, the domino Michael addition/cyclization reaction between oxoindoline 1e and 2a was conducted on a gram scale (1e: 1 g) using optimized reaction conditions (3a: 5 mol %, THF, 0 °C, 48 h) and the corresponding product 4e was obtained in excellent chemical yield (96%). Unfortunately,
the enantioselectivity of 4e was 35% ee (see the Supporting Information). This result indicated
that a detailed examination of the reaction conditions should be necessary
(on a small scale) for obtaining satisfactory optical purity of 4e for use on the gram scale.

On the basis of the observed
enantiopurity (95% ee) of chiral spiro-pyran 4e that
was obtained from the reaction of 1e and 2a using catalyst 3a, the enantioselective reaction
course was proposed as follows (Scheme 5). The configuration of 3a might be fixed
by the hydrogen-bonding interaction between the hydroxyl hydrogen
atom on diphenyl hydroxyl part at side chain and the squaramide carbonyl
group. The active methylene proton of dimedone 2a is
abstracted by basic tertiary nitrogen in the pyrrolidine ring of 3a, and the generated enolate species forms hydrogen bond
with ammonium site of 3a. Furthermore, the oxoindoline 1e is also fixed to catalyst 3a through two hydrogen-bonding
interactions of cyano groups on 2a with two amino hydrogen
atoms of the squaramide part of the catalyst. Among the two proposed
transition states Ts-I and Ts-II, the Michael
addition might proceed through Ts-II that has less steric
interactions between the substrate and enolate species than those
of Ts-I that has larger steric interactions between 1e and enolate species. Thus, enolate of dimedone 2a attacks the electron-deficient olefin site of oxoindoline 1e from the side below (si face) to afford
the chiral Michael adduct X. Furthermore, subsequent
intramolecular cyclization leads to the formation of intermediate Y. Finally, tautomerization of 2-iminopyran Y might afford the formation of (3S)-4e as the major enantiomer.

Conclusions
We
have demonstrated the first successful enantioselective domino
Michael addition/cyclization reaction of cyclic 1,3-diketones using
our new hybrid-type squaramide-fused amino alcohol (SFAA) organocatalysts 3a–e containing both the Brønsted
basic site and hydrogen-bonding sites. In the used SFAA catalysts,
the catalyst 3a especially showed excellent catalytic
activity in the reaction of oxoindolines 1a–m with 2a–f to afford the
quaternary stereogenic chiral spiro-conjugated oxindoles with 2-aminopyrans
fusing carbo-heterocyclic ring systems 4a–r in excellent chemical yields (up to 98%) with satisfactory-to-excellent
enantioselectivities (up to 95% ee). The obtained chiral spiro-conjugated
oxindoles 4a–r bearing quaternary
stereogenic chiral carbon center may work as efficient synthetic intermediates
for the synthesis of chiral biologically active compounds and for
drug discovery.

Experimental Section
General Information
All reagents and solvents used
in this work were bought from commercial channels and used directly.
Oxoindolines 1a–m were prepared according
to the literature procedure.10 All reactions
were placed under argon atmosphere in flame-dried 4 mL sample vials
inserted with magnetic beads. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was
performed on Merck silica gel 60 F254 plates, and the analytes
were identified under UV light. Flash column chromatography was performed
using silica gel pore size 60N (40–100 μm). Melting points
were recorded with a micro-melting-point apparatus. IR spectra were
recorded with a JASCO 4100 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data were recorded
using JEOL JNM-ECA500 instrument with tetramethylsilane as the internal
standard. X-ray diffraction data of 4e were collected
at 93 K on a Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID diffractometer using multilayer mirror
monochromated Cu Kα radiation. HPLC data were collected using
TOSOH instrument equipped with (UV-8020, DP-8020, and SD-8022) detectors
using CHIRALCEL OD-H and CHIRALPAK AD-H columns. Optical rotations
were recorded using a JASCO DIP-360 digital polarimeter. High-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) data were collected by electron impact (EI)
and fast atom bombardment (FAB) modes using Hitachi RMG-GMG and JEOL
JNX-DX303 sector instruments.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Compounds (4a–r)
To a 4 mL sample vial containing
1,3-diketones 2a–f (0.1 mmol) and
catalyst 3a (5 mol %) was added anhydrous THF (1.0 mL).
The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at 0 °C for 1 h, followed
by addition of 3-dicyano-2-oxoindolines 1a–j (0.1 mmol) at the same temperature. The reaction mixture
was allowed to be stirred at the same temperature for 48 h. After
completion of reaction, indicated by TLC, the residue was purified
by using flash column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane, 4:6).
The enantiomeric excess was determined by chiral HPLC using CHIRALPAK
AD-H or CHIRALCEL OD-H columns.
