Several parameters,
including specific surface area, morphology,
crystal size, and dopant concentration, play a significant role in
improving the photocatalytic performance of ZnO. However, it is still
unclear which of these parameters play a significant role in enhancing
the photocatalytic activity. Herein, undoped and Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doped
platelet-like zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures were synthesized via
a facile microwave synthetic route, and their ultraviolet (UV) and
visible-light-induced photocatalytic activities, by monitoring the
gaseous acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) degradation, were systematically
investigated. Both the pure and doped ZnO nanostructures were found
to be UV-active, as the CH3CHO oxidation photocatalysts
with the Cu-doped ZnO one being the most UV-efficient photocatalyst.
However, upon visible light exposure, all ZnO-nanostructured samples
displayed no photocatalytic activity except the Co-doped ZnO, which
showed a measurable photocatalytic activity. The latter suggests that
Co-doped ZnO nanostructures are potent candidates for several indoor
photocatalytic applications. Various complementary techniques were
utilized to improve the understanding of the influence of Mn-/Co-/Cu-doping
on the photocatalytic performance of the ZnO nanostructures. Results
showed that the synergetic effects of variation in morphology, surface
defects, that is, VO, high specific surface areas, and
porosity played a significant role in modulating the photocatalytic
activity of ZnO nanostructures.

1 Introduction
Photocatalysis is regarded
as the most exceptional oxidation approach
to resolve environmental issues associated with air pollution and
textile industrial wastewater.1 Semiconductors
have been demonstrated to be the most effective photocatalysts for
the degradation of pollutants in various forms, such as volatile organic
compounds and organic dyes, because of their well-defined electronic
band structure with occupied valence and unoccupied conduction bands
(CBs).2,3 Currently, several semiconductors, including
ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3, and WO3, have been widely investigated as ultraviolet (UV) and visible light
response photocatalysts in several photocatalytic applications, such
as hydrogen production from water splitting and environmental pollution
mitigation, because of their unique properties.2−4 As a wide band
gap (3.4 eV) n-type semiconductor,5−7 ZnO has attracted tremendous
attention as a potent photocatalyst because of its simplicity in fabrication,
high electrochemical stability, high optical and electrical properties,
and low toxicity.8−10 Several research efforts have been made to demonstrate
the advantages of ZnO as an efficient photocatalyst, in particular
for the fabrication of novel building coatings that are able to degrade
organic pollutants. Nonetheless, its poor efficiency associated with
its wide energy band gap, as well as the fast recombination of photoinduced
electron–hole pairs, practically restricts its exploitation.
Further, the wide band gap of ZnO restricts its photocatalytic activity
only when exposed to UV light.3 Therefore,
it is challenging to extend ZnO response into the visible light region
and to develop surface-modified ZnO nanostructures with advantageous
properties for indoor applications.11 Among
the strategies that have been proposed to modify a ZnO photocatalyst,
transition-metal ions, doping has recently become a hot topic of research
because it further reduces the recombination rate, thus enhancing
its photocatalytic performance by creating traps for holes and/or
electrons and immobilizing the charge carriers.2

Other parameters that have been demonstrated to have
a significant
impact on the photocatalytic performance include specific surface
area, morphology, crystal sizes, and defect concentration.2 Several research groups have studied the photocatalytic
effectiveness of ZnO nanomaterials.12,13 Previous findings
have revealed that nanostructured catalysts play a significant role
in assisting produced electrons in reaching the surface and reacting
with electron acceptors in a shorter transfer distance.2 On the other hand, the ability to produce, manipulate,
and optimize the desired uniform architecture/morphology of nano-sized
ZnO exhibiting desired properties is of paramount importance and has
gained a lot of interest. As a result, various nanostructured ZnO
materials, in various forms, such as nanofibers, nanorods, nanospheres,
and nanosheets, have been developed using several synthetic approaches.14−17 Furthermore, surface defects, such as oxygen vacancies (VO), are considered to be the dominant reactive sites of semiconductor
photocatalyst surface, for small molecule activation. It is also essential
to note that previous findings, in which VO defects on
the semiconductor photocatalyst surface were well controlled, have
demonstrated that electron mobility, visible light absorption, and
target air pollutant enrichment can be improved to affect the photocatalyst
reactivity substantially.

In this context, it has been reported,
herein, that the utilization
of a microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis approach aimed to produce
undoped and Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures for indoor applications.
ZnO hierarchical nanostructures, whose platelet-like structure arrangement
was shown to vary with the introduction of different types of transition-metal
dopant ions, were achieved. A detailed comparison study was conducted
using various techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), photoluminescence (PL)
spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to gain more
insight into the dependence of morphological, textural, and the surface
defects, tailored by various types of dopant ions on the photocatalytic
performance of ZnO nanostructures.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural Analysis Using
X-ray Diffraction
and SEM
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the undoped
and Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures (Figure 1) showed sharp and intense diffraction peaks
corresponding to the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO (JCPDS card
no. 36: 1451). No evidence of extra phases was provided, indicating
that the dopant ions of Mn2+/Co2+/Cu2+ have been successfully doped into the ZnO lattice. However, a shift
toward lower 2θ as well as an increase of diffraction peaks
intensity with the introduction of various dopant ions (i.e., Mn,
Co, and Cu) into the ZnO lattice was observed. The insets of Figure 1 depict the high-resolution
diffraction peaks of both undoped and doped ZnO that correspond to
the (101) plane where a noticeable shift to lower 2θ angles
with the addition of various dopant ions can be clearly seen. The
observed shift of the diffraction peak positions toward lower 2θ
angles indicates partial substitution of Mn2+ (0.8 Å),
Co2+ (0.74 Å), and Cu2+ (0.73 Å) into
the Zn2+ lattice with an ionic radii of 0.74 Å, which
leads to lattice expansion.18−21 The average crystallite sizes of both the undoped
and metal-doped ZnO samples were also determined by measuring the
full width at half-maximum of the intense diffraction peak associated
with the (101) plane using the Debye–Scherer formula.22 As mentioned in Table 1, the average crystallite sizes were found
to increase from 14.71 nm of undoped ZnO to 16.53, 21.59, and 24.61
nm of Co-, Mn-, and Cu-doped ZnO, respectively. The lattice distortions
formed after adding dopant ions with different ionic radii into ZnO
lattice are the main causes of the observed increase in the average
crystallite size.18 On the basis of the
observed results, the effect of Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doping on the crystallite
structure of ZnO was further investigated, and the lattice parameters
for all the ZnO products were calculated using eq 1.22 1  where h, k, and l are the Miller indices; a and c are the lattice constants; and d is the interplanar
spacing, which can be determined from Bragg’s
law 2

The
calculated lattice parameters calculated for undoped, Mn-,
Co-, and Cu-doped ZnO are listed in Table 1, where it is apparent that the lattice parameter a increased upon addition of different types of dopant ions,
while the lattice parameter c decreased under similar
conditions. Such variations in lattice parameters, with the addition
of Mn2+/Co2+/and Cu2+ as dopant ions,
can be attributed to complex formation defects in Co-, Mn-, and Cu-doped
ZnO nanostructures and to the substantial differences between the
ionic radii of the foreign/dopant ions and those on the ZnO host lattice.22 In addition, the observed increase of lattice
parameter a after the addition of different dopant
ions confirms the incorporation of Mn2+ (0.8 Å), Co2+ (0.74 Å), and Cu2+ (0.73 Å) ions into
the interstitial sites in the ZnO host lattice.19−21

The morphologies
were also determined before and after the addition
of the different transition metals as dopant ions, by employing SEM,
and are presented in Figure 2. For undoped ZnO, numerous thin-layered porous platelet-like
structures consisting of many small uniform particles assembled into
hierarchical nanostructures were observed. Upon addition of Co into
the ZnO lattice, the thin-layered platelet-like hierarchical structure
was still maintained, but a more random pore distribution in the platelets
was observed. For both the Mn- and Cu-doped ZnO samples, SEM observations
revealed that the thin-layered platelet morphology was still preserved;
however, these platelets were closely packed to each other as roselike
cross-linked. In this case, the porous hierarchical architecture obtained
in those ZnO nanostructures plays a significant role in enhancing
the accessible surface area. The latter would further lead to an increase
in both active sites and sorption capacity and thus would improve
the photocatalytic performance of the sample.

ZnO and Mn- Co-, and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures.

2.2 Textural Analysis Using BET
To improve
our understanding of the textural nature of the undoped and Mn-, Co-,
and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures, N2 adsorption–desorption
measurements were conducted. In Figure 3, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
and Barret–Joyner–Halenda pore-size distribution plots
(see the insets of Figure 3) are shown for undoped and Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures.
It is well demonstrated that the nature of dopant ions is significant,
affecting both the BET-specific surface area and the pore-size distribution.
For both the undoped and the metal-doped ZnO nanostructures, the gas
sorption measurement revealed a type-IV curve, according to the IUPAC
classification showing a characteristic hysteresis loop indicating
the presence of mesopores. The only exception to the latter behavior
was the Mn-doped sample, which exhibited a substantially higher N2 sorption compared to the remaining ZnO nanostructures, studied
herein. Such differences could be associated with the alteration in
the platelet structure arrangements, as observed by SEM when different
types of dopants are introduced into the ZnO lattice. Also, high surface
area values were determined for both undoped and Co-doped ZnO nanostructures
(see the inset table in each figure) that can be associated with the
porous thin-layered platelet-like structures consisting of nanoparticles
assembled into hierarchical nanostructures. Higher specific surface
area values allude to a large number of reactive sites, while higher
pore diameter and pore volume indicate higher sorption capacity.

and Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures.

2.3 Optical Properties
2.3.1 Optical
Absorption
The investigation
of the optical absorption properties of the ZnO nanostructures before
and after the introduction of dopant ions was performed through the
measurement of the UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra.
The optical reflectance spectra of both the undoped and Mn-, Co-,
and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures are shown in the inset of Figure 4. As depicted in Figure 4, low reflectance
and high reflectance in the UV and visible regions were observed for
all ZnO nanostructures. It should be mentioned here that low reflectance
corresponds to high absorbance. In this context, all doped ZnO nanostructures
displayed high absorption both in the UV and visible regions. It is
also well established that the initial process of semiconductor-based
photocatalysis involves the excitation of electrons from the valence
band (VB) to the CB, upon light irradiation. Thus, the observed high
absorption in the UV and visible regions of the doped samples may
enhance their photocatalytic performance upon UV and visible light
exposure.23

Figure 4 [F(R∞)hν]2 vs (hν) curves
of undoped and Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures. The inset
shows the reflectance spectra of both undoped and doped ZnO nanostructures.

Furthermore, the optical band gap values for both
the undoped and
doped ZnO nanostructures were determined based on optical spectral
absorption using the equation , where  is
the Kubelka–Munk function.24,25R∞ is the ratio between the diffuse
reflectance from the sample and the reference material, A is a constant, hν is the incident photon
energy, and n is 1/2 or 2 for indirect and direct
transitions, respectively. The optical band gap values of the samples
were obtained by extrapolating the linear part of the plot of [F(R∞)hν]2 versus (hν) (see Figure 4) to hν equal to zero and were found to be 3.19, 3.16, 3.11, and
3.13 eV for undoped, Co-, Mn-, and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures, respectively.
It is worth noting that the extrapolated values are comparable to
those for bulk ZnO (3.34 eV).26 Importantly
though, a band gap red shift observed for all the doped ZnO nanostructures
compared to the undoped ones can be attributed to band edge bending
induced by doping.27 Therefore, the observed
energy band gap narrowing with doping can be related to sp–d
exchange interactions between the localized d-electrons and the electrons
of the dopant ions of Mn2+, Co2+, and Cu2+ that substitute Zn2+ ions.28 Such exchange interaction resulted in negative and positive
corrections to the VB and CB edges, respectively, leading to an absorbance
and energy band gap red shift. This band gap shrinkage could also
be explained by the increased defects on the ZnO surface, when dopants
are introduced, which is also consistent with the observations from
XRD. Similar Eg trend was also reported
by Sangeetha et al.,27 while Bylsma et
al.29 employed second-order perturbation
theory to demonstrate that the red shift of the band gap was due to
the sp–d exchange interaction. As mentioned, the observed narrowing
of the energy band gap is also associated with a red shift of the
absorption features (see Figure 4) of the doped samples, suggesting that their photocatalytic
properties might also be shifted toward the visible region.

2.3.2 Photoluminescence
Because half
of the tetrahedral voids of the wurtzite structure of ZnO are not
filled, its structure is relatively open and therefore can have inherent
defects. This offers one an opportunity to control or tune its properties
through the addition of reasonably small amounts of dopant ions to
suit specific needs and applications because doping can cause significant
changes in electronic, optical, structural, and even magnetic properties
by changing the electronic structure of ZnO. On the other hand, the
changes in the morphological and structural features of ZnO have a
significant influence on PL analysis. Therefore, to provide reasonable
explanations of various photocatalytic behaviors (to be discussed
in the upcoming section) observed in this work with the addition of
different types of dopant ions, the PL technique was employed to gain
more understanding of intrinsic defects of ZnO. Previous findings
have demonstrated that the defects found in nanostructured ZnO include
VO and Zni with different charged states, as
well as VZn.9 The emission bands
occurring as a result of the aforementioned defects usually appear
near the blue-green, yellow, and orange-red regions in the ranges
between 480 and 550, 550–610, and 610–750 nm, respectively.21 In some instances, coexistence of various types
of defects may occur for the same sample, and this often results in
the generation of a nonsymmetrical broad emission band which can then
be deconvoluted into multiple bands equivalent to various emissions
associated with oxygen- and zinc-related defects. Figure 5 shows the comparison between
the PL spectra for the undoped, Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures
using a 350 nm excitation light. All samples exhibited a single broad
asymmetric band with intensified UV emission. Such asymmetric features
indicate the superposition of multiple emission bands. A red shift
in the high intensity of UV emission from 383 nm in the undoped ZnO
to 391, 392, and 394 nm in Co-, Cu-, and Mn-doped ZnO was also observed.
This shift on the UV emission toward visible light is consistent with
the observed energy band gap red shift in all doped samples.30 To further investigate the origin of the broad
emission, the PL spectra of undoped ZnO were fitted into five emission
peaks using a Gaussian multipeak fit function. The most intense peak
at the lowest wavelength of 383 nm corresponds to the characteristic
emission of ZnO and can be assigned to the band edge emission or the
exciton transition.31−33 Theoretical predictions have revealed that the Zni (neutral), Zni (single charged), and Zni (double-charged) shallow donor levels are positioned slightly below
the CB at 0.22–0.5 eV.9,21 Therefore, emission
bands in the violet-blue region at 402 and 422 nm arise from the transition
of electrons from zinc interstitials (Zni) with different
charges, including both neutral and single charge.9 Regarding the cause of the broad green emission from ZnO,
it is strongly believed that it may not be assigned to a single source
of luminescence. As widely reported, VO-related defects
are considered to be the origin of the broad green emission, which
are commonly reported oxygen vacancy (VO) defects in ZnO
nanostructures. These defects exist in three different charge states,
namely, double-charged (VO++), single-charged (VO+), and neutral oxygen vacancies (VO).9,21,31,33 In this case, the recombination of single charged
(VO+) states
with holes in the VB resulted in green emission at 480 nm.9,21 This results in the emission peaks to be located at 450 nm and therefore
can be associated with VZn.9,21

Figure 5 Comparison
of the PL spectra of undoped and Mn-, Co-, Cu-doped
ZnO nanostructures using 350 nm excitation wavelengths light.

The increase of the band edge emission intensity
with the addition
of various transition metals as dopant ions might be due to the enhanced
crystallinity of the doped ZnO. The latter is also in agreement with
the XRD results. Similar observations have also been reported previously.34 Also, the PL properties have been found to strongly
rely on the type and density of the defects in the ZnO nanostructures.
On the other hand, the defects can be trapped and act as recombination
centers for charge carriers. In a case where the density of defects
does not reach a limit or not high enough, the defects will contribute
mainly to the PL emission, resulting in the increase of the PL emission
intensity with an increasing density of defects. On the other hand,
if the density of defects is high enough, the defects will mainly
behave as the recombination centers and lead to the PL intensity decrease
with the increase of defect density.9 In
the current study, the increment of the broad violet-blue emission
band upon addition of Co into ZnO lattice associated with the increase
in the concentration or density of VO defects in ZnO resulted
in the creation of specific active sites for activation of few molecules
on the photocatalyst surface. In fact, VO defects offer
specific sites to strongly bind small molecules, thus enabling the
subsequent molecule activation by photogenerated electron injection
because they possess excess localized electrons.35 Therefore, because the higher the VO, the higher
the number of photocatalytic reactive centers, it is expected that
the photocatalytic activity for the Co-doped ZnO will be further improved.35

2.4 Chemical State Analysis
Detailed
surface chemical state analysis was conducted on the synthesized ZnO
nanostructures using XPS. High-resolution XPS spectra of O 1s, Cu,
Mn, and Co 2p core levels for undoped, Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doped ZnO
were acquired, in order to gain more insight into the way doping affects
the oxygen formed on the ZnO nanostructure surface, as well as to
confirm the presence of the dopant ions and probe their chemical state. Figure 6 shows the high-resolution
XPS spectra of the O 1s core level and their deconvoluted results.
As depicted in Figure 6a–d, the asymmetric O 1s feature present in the undoped and
Co-, Mn-, and Cu-doped ZnO indicates the existence of several oxygenated
chemical species in the near-surface region. The results were fitted
using three Gaussian components located at 528.9 eV (O1), 530.4 eV
(O2), and 532.2 eV (O3). A slight shift in the peak position for the
fitted components was observed for all the doped samples (see Table 2). The component at
low binding energy of 528.9 eV can be ascribed to the O2– ions in the Zn–O bonding of the ZnO wurtzite structure.36−38 The peak positioned at 530.4 eV corresponds to O2– ions and in particular to the oxygen-deficient regions of the ZnO
matrix. Finally, the last peak located at the highest binding energy,
532.2 eV, could be due to chemisorbed oxygenated species on the surface,
such as hydroxyl anions or adsorbed O2 and H2O.5,9 As shown in Table 2, the binding energy peak positions, when Co, Mn, and
Cu ions were introduced into the ZnO lattice, were shifted. Also,
the observed variations in the intensity of the O2 can
be associated with changes in the concentration of oxygen vacancies
(VO) defects, while the changes in this intensity of the
O3 could be associated with the photocatalytic behavior.6,9 As it is very well demonstrated in Table 2, the Co-doped ZnO nanostructure exhibited
the highest content of VO, as well as chemisorbed oxygen
forms, compared to the rest of the nanostructures studied herein. Figure 7 shows the high resolution
of (a) Cu, (b) Mn, and (c) Co 2p core levels, which revealed two binding
energy peaks at 932 and 950, 655 and 640, and 780 and 800 eV owing
to the spin–orbit splitting of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2,38 Mn 2p3/2 and Mn
2p1/2, and Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2,39 respectively. These results suggest that Cu,
Mn, and Cu ions were all in the +2 valence state, when they were added
into the ZnO lattice.

2.5 Photocatalytic Activity
of the Mn-, Cu-, and
Co-Doped ZnO Nanostructures
In this section, the UV and visible
(Vis) light-induced photocatalytic reactivity of pure and Mn-, Co-,
and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures toward gaseous CH3CHO are
presented. CH3CHO photocatalytic degradation products are
also reported. Finally, the CO product yield is given in the case
of Co–ZnO photocatalyst and discussed because of its potent
application for indoor (Vis-activated) use.

Figure 8 shows a typical experiment
using undoped ZnO as a photocatalyst, where CH3CHO loss
was monitored as a function of time under dark conditions (adsorption–desorption)
and after sequential exposure cycles of the optical cell to Vis and
UV light. Each spectrum, in the CH3CHO temporal loss plot,
was measured with 64 co-added scans, at 1 cm–1 resolution,
which corresponds to 10 min of irradiation. A double-exponential fit
very well represents the experimental data through the whole experimental
duration, indicating that the competitive adsorption–desorption
processes were dominating under all the employed conditions (i.e.,
in the absence of artificial light, as well as under both UV and Vis
light exposure) and no CH3CHO photocatalytic degradation
was observed within the precision of the measurements. Also, no product
formation was detected within the detection sensitivity of the method
both under dark or visible light irradiation conditions, justifying
the minor effect of the title processes. However, UV light irradiation
resulted in CO and CO2 production, centered at ∼2144
and ∼2350 cm–1, respectively, revealing some
photocatalytic activity of the undoped ZnO nanostructures in outdoor
environments. It is worth to note that the photocatalytic efficiency
of ZnO under UV light exposure was substantially lower compared to
the commercially available P-25 TiO2 nanostructure that
has been measured previously.40

under dark conditions (black line), Vis irradiation (green line),
and UV exposure (purple line) of pure ZnO sample in CH3CHO balanced with synthetic air at 296 K and 700 Torr.

Mn and Cu addition, as dopant ions, into the ZnO lattice
did not
dramatically change the photocatalytic properties of the undoped ZnO
nanostructures when it was irradiated with UV light, resulting mainly
in CO2 and, to a lower extent, CO formation. Similarly,
no photocatalytic activity was observed for Mn- and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures
when irradiated with visible light. Figure 9 shows CH3CHO loss under UV irradiation
of the Mn-doped ZnO nanostructures, as well as the temporal profile
of CO2 formation, verifying that it comprises a major UV-light-induced
CH3CHO photocatalysis end product. Minor CO formation was
also observed, at marginally higher levels compared to the method’s
detection sensitivity (5 × 1013 molecule cm3).

CH3CHO. (a) Upper panel: Dark (black circles) and UV (purple

In the case of Cu-doped ZnO photocatalyst, pronounced UV-induced
photocatalysis of CH3CHO, as well as increased and systematic
CO formation, was displayed as shown in Figure 10. However, no photocatalytic activity was
detected under Vis light irradiation for both 0.25% Mn- or Cu-doped
ZnO nanostructures.

sample toward
CH3CHO. Upper panel: (a) Dark (black circles) and UV (purple

CO formation under sample UV irradiation (purple circles).

On the other hand, the introduction of Co into the ZnO lattice
led to the measurable photocatalytic activity under Vis light irradiation,
while UV photoactivation was substantially reduced (see Figure 11). The latter suggests
that Co-doping red-shifts the absorption spectrum of ZnO toward the
visible light region. Co2+ has a valence electronic configuration
of [Ar]3d7 such that during the photocatalytic process,
electron or hole trapping will result in [Ar]3d8 and [Ar]3d6 electron structures, respectively, both are unstable. The
trapped electron will then be transferred to O2, so as
Co to return to the most energetically stable electronic configuration,
and H2O will be trapped in the positive holes producing
O2– and OH radicals, respectively. The
better Vis-induced photocatalytic performance of Co-doped ZnO compared
to the nanostructures with Mn and Cu dopants in the visible region
might be attributed to synergetic effects and that their impact has
not been evaluated in detail herein. Theoretical calculations, such
as density functional theory–time dependent, can be possibly
utilized to study the energetics of the electronic states involved,
though it was beyond the scope of this study. However, although all
three dopants red-shift the spectrum to the visible region and can
be potent Vis photocatalysts, Co-doping had the most significant effect
on the lattice parameter change as well as on the Olattice/Osurface ratio. The latter, along with the increase of
the surface adsorption sites, suggests that CH3CHO oxidation
predominantly takes place on the surface, indicating that it might
be the main reason for Co-doping to be superior compared to Mn- and
Cu-doping. Notably, in the case of Cu-doping, where the highest increase
of the adsorption sites was observed, the electron capturing results
in a very stable electronic configuration, [Ar]3d10, that
might prohibit photocatalytic reactivity. Therefore, Co-doping of
ZnO might be an efficient way to synthesize photocatalysts for indoor
applications. However, carbon monoxide (CO) formation was also observed
under Vis light-induced photocatalytic degradation of CH3CHO at substantial levels.

and UV (purple circles)-induced CH3CHO temporal loss. (b)
Vis-induced CO product yield measurement (green circles) employing
Beer–Lambert law for determining CH3CHO and CO concentrations.
Linear least-squares analysis resulted in an yield of 0.22 ±
0.05, with the quoted uncertainty to be the 2σ of the fit.

Because CO is known to be toxic, especially in
the indoor environment,
the production yield was determined by measuring CH3CHO
and CO IR cross sections as part of this work and employing the Beer–Lambert
law. In particular, 4.19 × 10–19 and 8.23 ×
10–20 cm2 per molecule at 1745.54 and
2165.67 cm–1 were used for determination of CH3CHO and CO concentrations, as infrared cross-sectional values,
respectively. Integrated band strengths were also used for determining
the CO concentrations, and the results were consistent to each other,
within the uncertainty of the measurements. CO product yield was determined
to be (22 ± 5)%, that is, a high conversion factor of CH3CHO to an even more toxic end product, and it should be taken
under consideration. The quoted error limit is 2σ (95% level
of confidence) and does not include systematic uncertainties. Similarly,
CO2 product yield was also measured to be (108 ± 32)%.
The relatively high risk in CO2 measurements is mainly
due to possible instabilities on background CO2 levels
during the measurement time as well as possible adsorption of the
products on the surface. Therefore, the formation of other minor intermediate
outcomes, such as CH3C(O)OH, cannot be excluded and can
amount for an ∼(70 ± 40)% lack of CH3CHO conversion
to CO and CO2 mass balance.

It is worth to note that
replicate experiments were also performed
after using the photocatalyst to evaluate photocatalyst reusability.
In the present study, we run three repeated cycles, in which a decrease
of ∼3% of both CH3CHO on surface adsorption and
photocatalytic efficiency of Co–ZnO nanostructure was observed
after every cycle. Although the reusability should be evaluated after
photocatalysts were spread on panels and under real indoor atmospheric
conditions, the first results are promising for indoor environmental
remediation applications.

On the basis of the above discussion,
the observed variation in
the photocatalytic activity for all the ZnO nanostructures (both undoped
and doped) can, therefore, be elucidated. The photocatalytic activity
is known to have a direct correlation with the lattice-to-surface
ratio found on the surface of the material. Under light irradiation,
surface defects, such as oxygen vacancies, promote the separation
of electron–hole pairs, enhancing the activity during photocatalytic
reactions.41

Under the ultra-high
vacuum in the XPS chamber, the adsorbed hydroxyl
groups are removed. Therefore, the observed hydroxyl groups were attributed
to •OH and H2O, strongly bound to the
surface defects of the nanomaterial. Many studies have demonstrated
that the photocatalytic performance is related to both oxygen defect
concentration and the type of that defect. For instance, surface hydroxyl
groups facilitate the trapping of photoinduced electrons and holes,
resulting in higher photocatalytic efficiency.42

It is also known that photocatalyst performance might
be improved
with the addition of metal dopants. The introduction of dopants affects
the crystallite size, as well as porosity and surface area, and thus
could alter both the energy band gap and the lifetime of the electron–hole
pair. Higher oxygen vacancies lead to higher photocatalysis and more
recombination centers.35 In this work,
doping appears to increase the oxygen vacancies for all the studied
samples. The absorption of photoenergy results in electrons transferring
from the valence to the CB forming electron–hole pairs. In
the absence of defects in the crystalline, these photogenerated electron–hole
pairs have a speedy recombination rate both in bulk and on the surface.
Photogenerated electrons and holes initiate photoredox reactions,
on the surface, where electrons reducing electron acceptors and holes
oxidizing electron donors. However, defects in the crystalline can
trap the holes, acting as new recombination centers. These trapped
holes react with electron donors, increasing the photocatalytic activity.
Surface defects play an essential role in photocatalytic activity.41 From all measured XPS results, it is concluded
that the higher photocatalytic performance (both under exposure to
UV or Vis light) is achieved in the lower lattice/surface ratio. Overall,
the amount of surface oxygen (oxygen vacancies and defect of hydroxyl
radical) is recommended to be equal or higher to the oxygen found
in the lattice.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
the findings from the investigations conducted on the
photocatalytic activity of the platelet-like ZnO hierarchical nanostructures
doped with various transition-metal ions, such as Mn, Co, and Cu,
at a low optimized concentration of 0.25% are presented. The photocatalytic
studies performed in the present work revealed that Co-doped ZnO was
the only photocatalyst that exhibited photocatalytic activity under
Vis light irradiation. Therefore, Co-doped ZnO could be a potent photocatalyst
that can be utilized for indoor applications. The remaining photocatalysts,
including undoped, Mn-, and Cu-doped ZnO, were only UV light-responsive
and displayed no photocatalytic activity under Vis light irradiation.
Findings from different characterization techniques including XRD,
SEM, BET, XPS, UV–Vis, and PL provide the information that
can interpret the observed photocatalytic behavior when different
types of dopants were added into the ZnO lattice. It was concluded
that different dopant ions affecting different essential parameters,
including morphology, surface defects, and specific surface area,
are directly related to the photocatalytic activity of the studied
ZnO nanostructures. For instance, the XRD results revealed the shift
in diffraction peak positions toward low 2θ angles and the alteration
in the lattice parameters between Co-, Mn-, and Cu-doped and undoped
ZnO nanostructures, indicating ZnO lattice expansion and formation
of complex defects on the ZnO surface. On the other hand, diffuse
reflectance spectra displayed shrinkage in the band gap of the nanostructured
ZnO with Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doped surface, which is correlated with
the shift in the band edge to higher wavelengths, indicating the introduction
of defects or impurity levels with addition of dopant ions. Indeed,
PL and XPS measurements also demonstrated the increase in the content
of surface defects with Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doping. However, BET-specific
area analysis revealed high surface area values for the undoped and
Co-doped ZnO nanostructures associated with the porous nature of the
platelet-like hierarchical structures consisting of many nano-sized
particles.

4 Experimental Procedure
4.1 Synthesis
of Undoped and Mn-, Co-, and Cu-Doped
ZnO Nanostructures
All chemicals used for the synthesis were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Undoped and Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doped ZnO
nanostructures were synthesized using the microwave-assisted hydrothermal
method. Solutions (0.1 M) of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), which was used as the starting
material along with hexamethylenetetramine, HMT (CH2)6N4, were dissolved into 250 mL of distilled water
and stirred for 45 min. Solution pH was maintained at 13 by dropwise
addition of hydroxide (NaOH) under constant stirring. The obtained
milky solution was transferred into four Teflon vessels and subjected
to microwave irradiation using an Anton PaarMultiwave 3000 oven at
220 °C for 15 min. The resulting white precipitate was then collected,
centrifuged, and washed several times with a mixture of deionized
water and ethanol.

Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doped ZnO nanostructures
were prepared following the same experimental procedure used to prepare undoped ZnO by also adding into the zinc precursor
solution stoichiometric amounts (0.25%) of manganese nitrate hexahydrate
(Mn(NO3)2·6H2O, cobalt nitrate
hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O),
and copper nitrate hexahydrate (Cu(NO3)2·6H2O), respectively. All products were kept at room temperature
overnight and dried using an electric oven at 200 °C for 2 h.
The experimental procedure used to prepare
ZnO nanoparticles is schematically presented in Figure 12.

of the synthetic procedure employed for
the preparation of ZnO nanostructures.

4.2 Characterization Techniques
To study
the phase purity and crystal structures of both undoped and Mn-, Co-,
and Cu-doped ZnO products, a Panalytical X’Pert PRO PW 3040/60
diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα (λ = 0.15405 nm)
monochromatic radiation source was used. An Auriga ZEISS scanning
electron microscope operated at 5 keV was also used to examine the
morphology of the samples. The BET, the specific surface area of the
ZnO products, was obtained using a Micrometirics TriStar 3000 surface
area analyzer. Preceding the analysis, the samples were degassed at
200 °C for 1 h under a continuous flow of N2 gas to
remove the adsorbed impurities. The optical absorption and PL spectra
of ZnO samples were then collected using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950
UV/Vis/NIR and PerkinElmer LS-55 Fluorescence spectrophotometer following
excitation at 325 nm. Finally, the chemical state analyses of both
the undoped and metal-doped ZnO samples were carried out using a VG
Escalab 220i XL X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with monochromatic
Al Kα radiation source (hν = 1486.6 eV).

4.3 Photocatalytic Reactivity Determination
The photocatalytic activity of undoped and 0.25% Mn-, Co-, and
Cu-doped ZnO was measured toward gaseous acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) employing photochemical static reactor technique coupled with
on-line Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Reactants
and stable products were simultaneously detected under static conditions
following photocatalysis progress. An experimental setup has been
described in detail previously,42 and only
information that is related to the present work is given herein. The
experimental setup consisted of four main units: (a) a cylindrical
Pyrex reactor of 16.3 cm optical length and 40 cm3 internal
volumes equipped with detached IR-transparent NaCl windows at both
ends. Gas inlets assorted with stop or needle valves designed for
controlled supply of gases and evacuating the cell were attached at
the top of the reactor, (b) distant-adjustable UV (300 W Osram Ultra
Vitalux) and visible (Vis, 500 W Vito Halogen Projector, VT 364) light
sources with emission spectra that satisfactorily simulate outdoor
and indoor light conditions, respectively, (c) gas preparing and handling
system that includes round storage bulbs and buffer volumes, differential
pressure transducers for pressure measurements, and vacuum rotary
pumps, and (d) FTIR spectrophotometer (JASCO FTIR-6300) that hosts
the reactor cell and used for real-time, on-line monitoring of stable
reactants and products.

First, CH3CHO photostability,
under ambient laboratory light, and other potent losses, that is,
heterogeneous and hydrolysis loss on the surface, were tested under
dark conditions for long exposure time. CH3HO (1 Torr)
was introduced into the reaction cell, and the total reactor pressure
was adjusted to 700 Torr using synthetic air (N2/O2, 80/20%), as bath gas. The infrared spectrum was recorded
at a resolution of R = 1 cm–1 between
500 and 4000 cm–1 using 64 coadded scans. Following
that, in the absence of external irradiation and with the reaction
cell covered with a black cloth, sequential spectra were recorded
every 10 min for 2 h. No change on CH3CHO absorbance was
observed (<0.5%) within the precision of the measurements, showing
that acetaldehyde’s dark loss is negligible within the experimental
detection sensitivity. Subsequently, the reactor was irradiated using
both UV and Vis light sources, separately, for long exposure times
(∼2 h). The IR spectra recorded at time intervals of 10 min
revealed that CH3CHO photolytic loss under experimental
conditions was insignificant. Once CH3CHO dark and photolytic
loss was excluded as the potential CH3CHO sinks, the reactor
was pumped out thoroughly and the photocatalyst was introduced inside
the reactor’s volume. More specifically, 0.050 ± 0.001
g of undoped, Mn-, Co-, and Cu-doped ZnO nanopowder samples were homogeneously
spread on a properly designed glass boat covering a geometric surface
of approximately 4.5 cm2 and were inserted into the reactor
via the detached NaCl windows. The sample thicknesses were estimated
using the expression d = m/(ρ
× A) to be 200 μm using a ZnO density ρ = 5.61 g
cm–3. Then, 0.9–1.6 Torr of CH3CHO was introduced into the cell, and the reactor pressure was balanced
to ∼700 Torr, with either N2 or N2/O2. The initial IR spectrum was recorded and CH3CHO
adsorption on doped ZnO surfaces was monitored, recording the IR spectra
every 10 min, in the absence of any artificial light. No further decrease
of absorbance signal verified surface saturation at 1745.74 cm–1 (C=O stretch). Afterward, the reaction cell
was irradiated with either UV or Vis light, and photocatalytically
induced CH3CHO degradation was determined as a function
of time. Simultaneously, the temporal profiles of stable photocatalytic
products were also monitored. Both lamps were adjusted at 60 cm distance
away from the photocatalyst surface, and the reaction cell was continuously
fan-cooled during the irradiation to maintain the ambient temperature
(296 ± 1 K) inside the reactor.
