In
this work, supramolecular l-l-diphenylalanine
(Phe–Phe) nanostructures were self-assembled in solvents of
distinct polarity and in the presence of luminescent additives of
distinct conjugation length that physically adhere to the nanostructures
to provide growth environments of distinct properties. When the additive
is poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene], an electron
donor polymer, and solvent is tetrahydrofuran (THF), Phe–Phe
vesicle-like structures are obtained, whereas in water and in the
presence of a similar additive in structure, poly[5-methoxy-2-(3-sulfopropoxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene],
nanotubes are formed. In contrast, when 9-vinyl-carbazole, an electron
acceptor additive is used, nanotubes are formed even when THF is the
solvent. The same structures are obtained when the additive is the
macromolecule poly(vinyl carbazole). The morphologies of these self-assembled
structures were observed by scanning electron microscopy, and their
photophysical behavior was determined by steady-state fluorescence
spectroscopy and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. These data
analyzed altogether inform about the formation mechanisms of such
structures and about the influence that distinct interactions exert
on self-assembling and charge-transfer processes through formation
of complexes between the luminescent additives and the Phe–Phe
nano- and microstructures.

Introduction
Supramolecular bottom-up
strategies are based on direct synthesis
of nanoparticles and enable particle size and shape control by the
modulation of preparation conditions.1−5 By these approaches, a wide range of nanostructures can be produced
using any type of material, from simple inorganic compounds to complex
organic systems.6−13 Supramolecular approaches also enable the understanding of the formation
processes of such structures and the identification of the associated
inter- and intramolecular driving forces that result in new structures.
Therefore, experimental conditions and procedures can be designed
in order to achieve the desired structures.14

Among the most prominent nanomaterials that find applications
in
science and technology are the sp2 carbon-based structures,
which can present distinct morphologies upon preparation methods,
such as single- or multiwalled nanotubes (carbon nanotube, CNT),15−18 fullerenes,19 or graphenes.20 Each of these structures presents peculiar properties
that find several technological applications, such as thermal and
chemical resistance, flexibility, and electric charge transport, the
last enabling them to act in charge-transfer processes. Specially,
CNTs present optical, magnetic, and optoelectronic properties beyond
the expected for such simple carbon aggregation, raising the question
on whether other organic compounds could present interesting properties
when self-assembled into similar structures. In this context, peptide
nanotubes are thought to be alternatives for the use of carbon structures,
such as those reported by Ghadiri et al.,21,22 in which l-l-diphenylalanine (Phe–Phe)
assumes a bidimensional ring configuration. In such array, Phe–Phe
rings pack in an antiparallel way, interacting with each other to
give a β-sheet structure.

Although several peptides have
been employed to describe the forces
involved in self-assembling,12,23−27 the interest devoted to Phe–Phe is due to its ability to
self-assemble into distinct structures, depending on the experimental
procedures adopted and the unique properties presented by each structure.28−30 With regard to it, Reches31 and Gazit32 showed that Phe–Phe derivatives self-assemble
into nanotubes when water is the solvent. Also, Gorbitz33 showed that Phe–Phe nanotubes present
a hexagonal organization in which the inner channels are hydrophilic,
whereas the external walls are hydrophobic.

By doping these
structures with a variety of additives, their already
surprising properties can be greatly improved to supply the needs
for new and extraordinary materials for scientific and technological
applications.34−40

Poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]
(MEH-PPV)
has attracted scientific attention because of its morphological and
optical properties that enable its application in electroluminescent
devices and solar cells, among others.41−44 The combination of this material
with organic or inorganic structures is a strategy to produce even
more sophisticated devices, such as the transistors constructed by
Aleshin45 and other applications.46−48

Carbazole derivatives are also fascinating compounds because
of
their ability to generate charge-transfer complexes when associated
with other electron carriers. Their polymerization has provided new
and efficient compounds for application in electroluminescent devices
and sensors.49−55

Considering these interesting compounds, the aim of this work
was
to produce distinct Phe–Phe self-assembled structures combined
with electroluminescent compounds via supramolecular bottom-up methodologies
and to determine the morphological and photophysical properties of
the resulting materials. They were determined by steady-state and
time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). The combined analysis of these results gives information on
the delicate balance of forces that favor the formation of a specific
structure in well-determined experimental conditions as well as on
the charge-transfer complex formation between the luminescent additives
and the peptide nanostructures, which are essential to evaluate their
applications in solar cells.

Results and Discussion
Self-assembled
diphenylalanine (Phe–Phe) distinct structures
were prepared in solvents with distinct polarizabilities and in the
presence of luminescent additives with distinct electronic characteristics
(electron donors and acceptors), solubility in distinct solvents (organic
solvents and water), and electronic conjugation length (small molecules
and polymers). All resulting self-assembled structures were numbered
from Sm1 to Sm5 and the preparation conditions, used materials, and
compounds as well as the details on the characterization methods and
techniques are presented in Experimental Methods. They were studied by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence
spectroscopy along with SEM, and data obtained for each system (Sm1
to Sm5) are presented in the following subsections.

Sm1 Morphology and Photophysics—Self-Assembled
Phe–Phe
in Tetrahydrofuran
In Figure 1, SEM images of the Sm1 sample deposited on glass substrate
are presented and they evidence lamellar structures of 2–10
μm wide, with shapes similar to the peony flowers-like, as those
observed by Su et al.56

Figure 1 SEM images of the Sm1
sample, recorded at secondary electron imaging
(SEI) with an electron beam energy of 7 kV, with a magnification of
2200 times.

Steady-state fluorescence
and excitation spectra obtained for Sm1
are shown in Figure 2. The excitation maximum wavelength is at 280 nm and the fluorescence
maximum is at 325 nm, with a shoulder at 410 nm and both present low
intensity, which is expected for Phe–Phe self-assembled structures.

Figure 2 Steady-state
spectra of (A) excitation (λem =
334 nm) and (B) fluorescence (λexc = 280 nm) recorded
for Sm1.

Figure 3 presents
the fluorescence decay curves recorded for Sm1 in the time-resolved
emission spectroscopy (TRES) experiment, run as detailed in Experimental Methods, with excitation performed
at 345 nm and fluorescence monitored at 360 (Figure 3A) and with excitation performed at 375 nm
and fluorescence monitored at 400 and 420 nm (Figure 3B), according to the maxima excitation and
emission wavelengths found in steady-state spectra presented in Figure 2. Table 1 presents the fluorescence lifetimes
obtained from the multiexponential global fit of these decay curves,
the pre-exponential factors, and the reduced χ2 values
that validate the exponential adjustments. It is observed that the
decay curve recorded at 360 nm presents a biexponential behavior,
whereas the decay curves recorded at 400 and 420 nm are triexponential.
Although there are longer lifetimes, such as 8.8 ns for the biexponential
curve and 4.8 ns for the triexponential curves, they contribute less
than 10% to the total decay curves. On the other hand, the shorter
lifetimes of tens of picoseconds obtained for the triexponential curves
seem to be the most important contributions to these decays. However,
they are too short to be accurately determined by the equipment used
in these experiments because the NanoLed (pulsed led) used in the
experiment presents a pulse width similar to those lifetimes (see
equipment information in Experimental Methods). The lifetime of 1.2–1.8 ns that is observed in all decays
is reliable and is in accordance with the lifetimes observed for Phe–Phe
self-assembled structures.57 Nevertheless,
the multiexponential behavior observed for this sample is due to the
fact that the self-assembling process originates a distribution of
structures with distinct conjugation lengths, resulting in a distribution
of electronic excited states that can be accessed by distinct excitation
wavelengths.

According to the accepted
Phe–Phe self-assembling mechanism,
the lamellar structures shown in Figure 1 suggest the initial β-sheet structure
formation, which, in THF, were unable to fold into themselves to generate
nanotubes and, as shown by other authors, gave rise to other structures
such as nanowires, vesicles, and gels.58−62 Yet, the peony-flowers-like structures shown in Figure 1 are believed to
result from lamellae stacking.56 From Figure 2, the expected optical
response for diphenylalanine assembles is obtained, which evidence
Sm1 composition as being diphenylalanine only, although the fluorescence
decay curves in Figure 3 reveal that there is a distribution of structures with distinct
conjugation lengths in Sm1.

Sm2 Morphology and Photophysics—Self-Assembled
Phe–Phe
with Additive MEH-PPV in THF
Figure 4 shows SEM images obtained for Sm2, in which
sphere-like structures are observed. Because they have a sear aspect,
it is inferred that these spheres may be vesicles. In fact, hollow
structures are expected in Phe–Phe self-assembling.63 According to Guo et al.,63 Phe–Phe β-sheet bilayers fold into themselves
to generate vesicles, in the same mechanism expected to occur here,
or they fold into nanotubes, depending on preparation conditions.
Considering it, interconversion between these structures may occur.
This assumption is supported by the images shown in Figure 4C, which presents tubules,
although in low occurrence.

Figure 4 SEM images of Sm2, recorded at SEI with an electron
beam energy
of 7 kV, with a magnification of (A) 950, (B) 10 000, and (C) 16 000
times.

Figure 5 shows fluorescence
and excitation spectra obtained for the Sm2 sample. As shown in Figure 5A, the maximum of
excitation is at 496 nm and a less intense band is observed at 330
nm, corresponding to the excitation maximum normally observed for
MEH-PPV moieties and Phe–Phe structures, respectively. Figure 5B shows the emission
spectra with excitation performed at these two excitation maxima.
When excitation is performed at 496 nm, which is the characteristic
excitation wavelength of MEH-PPV moieties, a fluorescence spectrum
at the MEH-PPV general emissive region is recorded, with a maximum
of fluorescence at 596 nm and a shoulder at 630 nm. A blue-shifted
shoulder at 540 nm is also identified, which is related to MEH-PPV
intrachain excitons.64−66 Because it is of low intensity, it indicates that
intrachain excitons are not the most important emission contribution
in this system and aggregation is expected to occur to some extent.
The red-shifted shoulder in the fluorescence spectrum at 630 nm is
due to these aggregates. When excitation is carried out at 330 nm,
emission occurs at the region in which MEH-PPV fluorescence is usually
observed, although of low intensity (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). In addition, a more
intense fluorescence band at 410 nm is observed, and it is coincident
with the maximum of fluorescence observed for Sm1, composed only of
Phe–Phe self-assembled structures.

Figure 5 Steady-state spectra
of (A) excitation (λem =
586 nm) and (B) fluorescence (λexc = 495 and 330
nm) recorded for Sm2.

The formation of vesicle-like structures interconnected by
nanotubes
in Sm2 enables us to infer on their mechanism of formation, once it
is our argument that vesicles form because of a more important polymer–peptide
interaction over a less important peptide–peptide π-stacking
interaction, showing that the self-assembling is governed by a dispute
of distinct interaction forces. Also, because by fluorescence spectroscopy
excitation at the wavelength of 330 nm results in a mixed emission
spectrum containing elements from both MEH-PPV moieties and Phe–Phe
structures, it is expected that hopping (and, therefore, charge transfer)
processes occur in such a system. Comparing the fluorescence spectra
of the MEH-PPV solution in THF (10–6 g L–1) (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) to those obtained for Sm2 (Figure 5), it is noteworthy that the most prominent emission
occurs at the characteristic region of MEH-PPV moieties. Nevertheless,
the relative intensity of fluorescence peaks at 550 nm, related to
MEH-PPV intrachain aggregates, and 630 nm, related to the emission
of interchain aggregates (I550nm/I630nm), is very distinct, being 3 for Sm2 and
0.5 for the MEH-PPV solution. This evidences that emission from the
intrachain aggregates is more important in the peptide/MEH-PPV system
than in the MEH-PPV solution. Although it was expected that in Sm2,
MEH-PPV chain aggregation would be more important than in solution,
this result is evidence for a nonexpected degree of disaggregation
of MEH-PPV when in contact with peptide structures, favored by π-stacking
interactions between them, possibly leading to the formation of a
charge-transfer complex. This assumption can be properly exploited
by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.

Fluorescence decay
curves obtained by the TRES experiment executed
for the Sm2 sample are presented in Figure 6, and fluorescence lifetimes obtained from
the multiexponential fit of these curves are presented in Table 2. For the TRES experiment
of all samples presented in this work, excitation and emission wavelengths
to monitor fluorescence decays were selected based on the steady-state
spectra for all samples. Detailed information is in the Experimental Methods section. Figure 6A presents the fluorescence decay curve recorded
with excitation at 335 nm and fluorescence monitored at 360 nm, which
shows a biexponential behavior, because at this wavelength, only Phe–Phe
structure is emitting, nevertheless, with a shorter lifetime, when
compared to that of Sm1. As longer emission wavelengths are analyzed,
the decay curves become multiexponential, indicating the increasing
contribution of MEH-PPV to the total decay curve. In fact, the decay
curves recorded with excitation at 375 nm and emission monitored at
the 400–600 nm range present at least three lifetimes, 0.3,
1.6, and 6 ns. Comparing these lifetimes to those obtained for Sm1,
the shorter lifetimes are the most prominent in both samples. They
present a longer lifetime, around 6 ns with very low contribution
to the total decay curve. Nevertheless, the Sm2 sample presents a
third lifetime, around 1.5 ns, contributing 15–20% to the total
curve that is very close to the lifetime found for the MEH-PPV solution
used as the additive (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). It is noteworthy that at the 425–500 nm
emission range, there is a change in the value of the intermediary
lifetime, as well as on its contribution. It becomes slightly longer,
being 1.7 ns, with around 30% contribution. Also, the longer lifetime
becomes more important at this emission region, contributing 15% of
the total decay curve. This behavior change may be related to an energy-transfer
complex formation in this system, active at this emission region.

Sm3 Morphology and Photophysics—Self-Assembled
Phe–Phe
with Additive 9-Vinyl-carbazole in THF
To explore the doping
effect on the Phe–Phe self-assembling and infer on the charge-transfer
complex formation, the sample Sm3 was prepared using 9-vinyl-carbazole
(9Cz) as the fluorescent additive. Compared to MEH-PPV, it is a small
molecule (Mw = 193.24 g mol–1; volume = 614.60 Å3; surface area = 285.74 Å2) and an electron acceptor, whereas MEH-PPV is an electron
donor. These distinct characteristics may have distinct influence
on the driving forces of the peptide self-assembling, favoring, in
certain conditions, electrostatic interactions, in other conditions,
π–π stacking interactions. Samples were prepared
as described in the Experimental Methods,
and SEM images obtained to evidence their morphologies are presented
in Figure 7.

Figure 7 SEM images
obtained for the sample Sm3, recorded at SEI with an
electron beam energy of 7 kV, with a magnification of (A) 1000 times
and (B) 5000 times.

Figure 7 shows nanotubes
resulting from Phe–Phe self-assembling with carbazole as the
additive. When deposited on a glass substrate, nanotubes grew radially
from a growth seed that is formed while the solvent is still present
in the substrate. After solvent evaporation and with the impingement
of two nanotubes, its growth is interrupted. From Figure 7B, the hexagonal geometry of
the Phe–Phe nanotubes is observed, as expected33 in conditions where electrostatic interactions in the inner
part of the nanotubes are favored, for instance, when water is the
solvent. In a previous work,44 we showed
that water is inserted in the prime Phe–Phe nanotubes to result
in the hexagonal geometry via electrostatic interactions between the
carboxyl and amino end-groups of the peptide with water molecules.
In these systems, however, water is not present, even though hexagonal
geometry is observed. Yet, the same lamellar structures observed in
Sm1 are also observed here, although in an extremely low proportion.
Information on the balance of interactions can be obtained by steady-state
fluorescence spectroscopy because they can influence carbazole fluorescence
and excitation spectra. They are presented in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Steady-state spectra of (A) excitation (λem =
430 nm) and (B) fluorescence (λexc = 350, 366, and
381 nm) recorded for Sm3.

Emission spectra were recorded upon distinct excitation wavelengths,
350, 366, and 381 nm, corresponding to the maxima wavelengths observed
in the steady-state excitation spectra. When compared to the spectra
expected for 9Cz diluted solutions in good solvents, such as chloroform67 and THF,68 these
are structureless and red-shifted, with its maximum of around 415
nm (2.99 eV), whereas the fluorescence maximum for the isolated carbazole
is expected to occur at 380 nm (3.26 eV),67 which corresponds to a loss of energy upon nonradiative deactivation
of 0.27 eV. The broad excitation spectrum suggests the formation of
ground-state aggregates in this sample. Also, there is a fluorescence
red shift upon excitation at longer wavelengths and a shoulder of
low intensity in the 530–580 nm region, indicating excimer
formation. These findings suggest that carbazole moieties are distributed
along the nanotubes in a short distance from each other and, considering
the possible electrostatic interaction between carbazole moieties
and peptide units, this proximity may inform about the self-assembling
mechanism.

Taking SEM results for Sm3 into account (Figure 7), where we identified
hexagonal nanotubes
with low occurrence of lamellar structures, we infer that these lamellae
are acting as growth seeds for nanotubes obtained with carbazole.
Interactions between Phe–Phe and carbazole moieties may influence
the π-stacking interaction, guaranteeing the self-assembling
into nanotubes, whereas when 9Cz is absent, the balance of interaction
forces prioritizes electrostatic forces upon π-stacking, resulting
in lamellae and vesicles. Because of 9Cz characteristic of electron
acceptance, its smaller dimensions compared to those of MEH-PPV, and
the luminescent characteristics recorded for Sm3, that is, excitation-dependent
fluorescence and excimer occurrence (Figure 8B), it is possible to locate the carbazole
moieties distributed along the nanotubes and interacting with it via
π-stacking. In this condition, 9Cz favors π–π
stacking to subdue electrostatic interactions and, consequently, favors
nanotube formation over vesicles. Also, because a comparison between
the fluorescence spectra of 9Cz diluted solutions and Sm3 evidences
loss of energy upon deactivation of 0.27 eV, it may refer to specific
carbazole–nanotube interactions, resulting in a charge-transfer
complex that may be formed in Sm3. Considering this possibility, the
fluorescence lifetime can inform about the occurrence of such interactions
and the formation of energy-transfer electronic excited-state complexes
because it may affect the fluorescence decay curves expected for both
the additive and the dipeptide structure. Figure 9 presents the fluorescence decay curves recorded
for Sm3, and Table 3 presents the corresponding fluorescence lifetimes.

Figure 9 Fluorescence decay curves
recorded for Sm3 with excitation at 345
nm and emission monitored at the range of 360–450 nm, with
a time resolution of 3.7 ps/channel.

From Figure 9, it
is noteworthy that the decay curve shapes change as the fluorescence
is monitored at longer wavelengths. With emission monitored at 360
and 370 nm, the decay curve is biexponential, presenting a shorter
lifetime of 1.6 ns and a longer lifetime of 5.6 ns, corresponding
to the lifetimes of the Phe–Phe structure. At longer emission
wavelengths, the decay curves are fitted by a multiexponential function,
giving rise to the same lifetimes observed earlier and a third component
of 2–3 ns, contributing 20–25% to the total decay curve.
As the fluorescence is monitored at longer wavelengths, it is observed
that the shorter lifetime assumes values of around 1.0–1.2
ns, being longer than the observed when the fluorescence is monitored
at shorter emission wavelengths, whereas the longer lifetime assumes
values of 7–8 ns. In this emission region, it is expected that
the decay curve has more substantial contributions of the 9Cz additive;
nevertheless, these longer lifetimes are shorter that those of the
9Cz solution, which is expected to be around 14 ns (see Figure S3
in the Supporting Information). On the
other hand, the shorter lifetimes of Sm3 are longer than those obtained
for 9Cz. Thus, the Sm3 fluorescence lifetimes are distinct from those
of the individual components, indicating that a complex is formed
to stabilize the electronic excited states of shorter lifetimes and
destabilize the longer-lived excited states, which may alter the population
of triplet states of 9CZ, which is a phosphorescent molecule.

Sm4 Morphology
and Photophysics—Self-Assembled Phe–Phe
with Additive MPS-PPV in Water
Figure 10 shows Phe–Phe nanostructures self-assembled
in water and doped with poly[5-methoxy-2-(3-sulfopropoxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]
(MPS-PPV), the PPV water-soluble derivative, similar in structure
to MEH-PPV (with a sulfonic termination instead of a long ether substituent,
as shown in Figure 18D, Experimental Methods), which were assigned
as Sm4. Nanotubes of a hexagonal structure were obtained under these
conditions, in contrast with vesicles obtained when THF is the solvent
and MEH-PPV is the additive. From Figure 10, the nanotube growth occurs radially in
a seeded growth regime and they associate with each other to generate
microtubes. It is evident that although these samples are prepared
with an additive very similar to MEH-PPV, no vesicles are formed,
only nanotubes, which evidence a preferable π-stacking of the
diphenylalanine aromatic rings driven by the Coulombic interaction
between the Phe–Phe carboxyl and amino end-groups and water.

Figure 10 SEM
images obtained for the Sm4 sample, recorded at SEI with an
electron beam energy of 7 kV, with a magnification of (A) 1000 and
(B) 1600 times.

Figure 11 shows
excitation and fluorescence spectra obtained for these samples. The
fluorescence spectra of MPS-PPV solutions (Figure 11C) are observed in a region similar to those
obtained for MEH-PPV solutions (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), presenting its maximum at 530 nm,
a shoulder at 470 nm, and another one of low intensity at 415 nm.
Its excitation spectrum (Figure 11A) is peculiar and presents a maximum at 370 nm, with
a shoulder at 430 nm and a half-intensity peak at 485 nm. These spectral
characteristics ensure that electronic states involved in the photophysical
processes identified for these systems are very similar to those identified
for systems containing MEH-PPV as the additive, enabling a comparison
between Sm2 and Sm4 in terms of behavior and possible interactions,
fostering considerations on charge-transfer processes and complex
formation.

Figure 11 Steady-state (A) excitation (λem = 560
and 565
nm) and (B) fluorescence (λecx = 346 and 495 nm)
spectra obtained for the Sm4 sample and (C) excitation (λem = 530 nm) and fluorescence (λexc = 360
nm) spectra of MPS-PPV 10–4 g L–1 solution in water.

The sample Sm4 was produced to evaluate the modulation of
the Phe–Phe/polymer
system photophysical and/or morphological behavior, considering that
nanotubes are expected to form in water and vesicles were obtained
in THF (Figures 10 and 4, respectively). Once nanostructures
are obtained, the role of PPV derivatives in the complex formation
and properties is elucidated. Figure 11A,B shows Sm4 fluorescence and excitation spectra,
which are compared to those obtained for Sm2 (Figure 5). From Figure 11B, when excitation of Sm4 is performed at
330–350 nm, an emission band at 400 nm is observed, as for
Sm2. Excitation at 495 nm results in a fluorescence maximum at 540
nm, which is blue-shifted with respect to that identified for Sm2
but red-shifted in comparison to the fluorescence spectra of the MPS-PPV
solution employed to produce the Sm4 sample, indicating MPS-PPV aggregation
in the system. Also, the shoulders identified in the fluorescence
spectra of the MPS-PPV solution are not present in Sm4, indicating
that aggregated chains are responsible for the most prominent fluorescence
rather than intrachain excitons that might exist in Sm4. In addition,
as also observed for Sm2, fluorescence at 540 nm is also observed
when excitation is carried out at 340 nm, indicating that a charge-transfer
complex is formed in this sample, which can be characterized by time-resolved
fluorescence spectroscopy.

Figure 12 presents
the decay curve recorded for Sm4, and lifetimes are presented in Table 4. The decay curve
in Figure 12A is biexponential,
with a shorter lifetime of around 300 ps with over 90% contribution.
The longer lifetime, which is greater than 5 ns, contributes less
than 3% to the total decay curve. As the fluorescence is monitored
at longer wavelengths, a third component of 1.2–1.5 ns rises,
with 8–10% contribution. The shorter lifetime is diminished
from 300 to 30 ps from shorter to longer emission wavelengths, with
85–97% contribution. The longer lifetime presents variable
contributions as the monitored emission wavelength changes and assumes
longer values of 5.8–6.5 ns. At the emission region from 425
to 500 nm, its contribution is around 11–14%, whereas from
520 to 600 nm, its contribution drops to 0.5%. A behavior change is
also observed at the region of emission from 425 to 500 nm, where
the intermediary lifetime becomes slightly longer, assuming values
of around 1.5–1.8 ns, but contributes almost 30% to the total
decay curve. This behavior is similar to that observed for Sm2.

Sm5 Morphology and Photophysics—Self-Assembled
Phe–Phe
with Additive PVK
Figure 13 presents the SEM images registered for Sm5, where
nanotubes were observed, also with the radial growth.

Figure 13 SEM images obtained
for the Sm5 sample, recorded at SEI with an
electron beam energy of 7 kV, with a magnification of (A) 1500 and
(B) 5500 times.

Because THF was the
solvent, vesicles were expected to form in
Sm5, as occurred in Sm2, if the solvent had a predominant effect on
the Phe–Phe self-assembling. Because only nanotubes were formed,
it shows that the effect of the solvent on self-assembling is not
as pronounced as the inductive effect of the carbazole units.

Fluorescence and excitation spectra obtained for Sm5 samples are
presented in Figure 14. Excitation spectra were recorded with the emission monitored at
426 and 547 nm and fluorescence spectra were recoded with excitation
at 265, 272, 294, 351, 364, and 526 nm, which were selected from the
excitation spectra.

Figure 14 Normalized (A) excitation (λem = 426
and 547 nm)
and (B) fluorescence (λexc = 266, 272, 294, 351,
364, and 526 nm) spectra obtained for the Sm5 sample.

Excitation spectra monitored at these two distinct
emission wavelengths
are also distinct. When emission is monitored at 426 nm, the maximum
of excitation is at 351 nm. With the fluorescence monitored at 547
nm, a broad band with a maximum at 366 nm and two other important
peaks at 273 and 298 nm are observed. This shows that there are distinct
emitting moieties in this system.

Both steady-state excitation
and emission spectra recorded for
Sm5 are distinct of the spectra normally obtained for PVK solution
that originated Sm5 (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). Fluorescence spectra recorded at distinct excitation
wavelengths occur in distinct regions, evidencing their excitation
wavelength-dependent behavior. When excitation is performed at 265
and 272 nm, an intense fluorescence is observed at 300–330
nm and a less intense band is observed at 450 nm. With excitation
at 294 nm, a band at 350 nm occurs in comparable intensity of a band
in 450 nm. When excitation is performed at 351 and 364 nm, a similar
band at 450 is observed, and excitation performed at 526 nm resulted
in fluorescence at 580 nm. This also evidences the coexistence of
distinct fluorescent moieties in Sm5, which is due to charge-transfer
complex formation and it can be exploited by time-resolved fluorescence.
Yet, excitation and fluorescence spectra are overlapped, which can
result in important self-absorption effects.

Figure 15 presents
the fluorescence decay curves recorded for Sm5, and Table 5 summarizes the data obtained
from the multiexponential fit of these curves.

The decays showed a
biexponential behavior, with a shorter lifetime
varying from 1 to 1.6 ns toward longer emission wavelengths and contributing
87–96% to the total decay curve. The longer lifetime varies
from 4.8 to 6.1 ns as monitored at longer emission wavelengths, and
it contributes 3–12% to the total decay curve.

This behavior
is distinct from that observed for pure poly(vinyl
carbazole) (PVK), which showed a multiexponential behavior (see Table
S3 and Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) and is related to the disaggregation of the polymer backbones and
its interaction with the Phe–Phe structure. Comparing it to
the Sm1 behavior, τ1 are very similar in value and
contribution; nevertheless, Sm1 behavior is also multiexponential
(see Table 1). It is
clear that the biexponential behavior of Sm5 and its fluorescence
lifetimes reflect the formation of new electronic excited states,
originated from the Phe–Phe/PVK interaction, which resulted
in a new structure, with a distinct photophysical behavior from the
initial compounds.

Theoretical Calculations
To understand
the reasons
for the balance of interactions of distinct Phe–Phe formed
upon distinct solvent and additives, theoretical calculations were
performed to give information on the energies of highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
orbitals and band gaps of a trimer of Phe–Phe in neutral and
zwitterion forms in vacuum, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and water. The
trimer was used because it represents the basic interacting structure
on self-assembled structures of Phe–Phe.69

From the optimized results of the structures, it
is possible to infer that components in the zwitterion are closer
to one another than the neutral components at any solvent used. This
greater proximity is due to more effective interaction between carboxyl
end-groups in the zwitterion peptide. Calculated energy band gaps
are shown in Table 6.

Table 6 HOMO–LUMO Band Gaps (eV) Calculated
for the Phe–Phe Trimer in Neutral and Zwitterion Forms in Vacuum,
THF, and Water
solvent	vacuum	THF	water	
trimer form	neutral	zwitterion	neutral	zwitterion	neutral	zwitterion	
bandgap
(eV)	4.131	4.089	4.174	3.990	4.210	3.992	
It is noteworthy that the
band gap for neutral forms is always
slightly higher than the band gap of the corresponding zwitterion.
Also, the band gap of the neutral form is larger in solvents than
in vacuum, being large in water, whereas zwitterion is equally stabilized
in both solvents because of the electrostatic interactions between
amino and carboxyl end-groups of the peptide that become important
in solvents and that give rise to interactions between the peptide
and the solvent molecules.

In Figures 16 and 17 are shown
HOMO and LUMO orbitals for the neutral
structures of the Phe–Phe trimer in vacuum, THF, and water.
In Figure 16, HOMO
orbitals are localized on the amide linkage and carboxyl end-groups
of the peptide structure, whereas LUMO orbitals are widely spread
on the aromatic rings and, in solvents, they are more delocalized
over the trimer than in vacuum.

Figure 16 Representation of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals
for the neutral Phe–Phe
trimer in vacuum, THF, and water.

Figure 17 Representation of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals for the zwitterion
Phe–Phe trimer in vacuum, THF, and water.

Figure 17 presents
the HOMO and LUMO orbitals calculated for the zwitterion Phe–Phe
trimer. Similar to the neutral structure, the zwitterion HOMO is localized
on the amide linkage for the trimer in vacuum and THF. In water, on
the other hand, it is localized over an aromatic ring of a diphenylalanine
molecule. LUMO orbitals are on the aromatic rings and delocalized
on the trimer. The distinct delocalization is the reason for the larger
band gaps of zwitterion when compared to the band gaps of neutral
structures. LUMO orbitals are very similar in water and THF. As expected,
the HOMO and LUMO of zwitterion structures are more delocalized over
the trimer than the neutral structure. It is noteworthy that LUMO
and HOMO orbitals are π-shaped in neutral and zwitterion forms.

Because of this orbital delocalization, distinct interactions with
the additives are possible, depending on the additive electronic properties.
MEH-PPV (as well as MPS-PPV) is an electron donor, whereas carbazole
derivatives are electron acceptors; thus, they interact differently
with the peptide, giving rise to distinct self-assembled structures.
Therefore, π-stacking interactions between Phe–Phe aromatic
rings and the MEH-PPV backbone are favored in THF, where Phe–Phe
is in the neutral form, originating in a β-pleated sheet structure
with an interleaved polymer that stacks in lamellae and results in
a vesicle or sphere. On the other hand, with carbazole derivatives,
preferable interactions are electrostatic between the end-groups of
the peptide and the nitrogen atom of the carbazole structure. This
is an acceptable explanation in either neutral or zwitterion form,
based on the delocalization of the HOMO orbital on the carboxyl and
amino groups of the peptide. Therefore, this interaction is preferable
in water as well as in THF. As a consequence, aromatic rings of the
peptide can interact with each other in a π-stacking-type interaction,
and this is the initial step for the peptide self-assembling into
a nanotube. In this way, nanotubes are formed when carbazole is the
additive, even when the solvent is THF. Yet, when in water, because
of the strong hydrogen bonds that are formed with the charged end-groups
of the peptide in the zwitterion or with the dipoles in the neutral
structure, the interaction with solvents directs the self-assembling
rather than the interaction with the additive MPS-PPV, which is not
the driving force to the self-assembling anymore, and nanotubes are
obtained.

Conclusions
This work corroborates
that Phe–Phe self-assembling is governed
by preparation conditions and, thus, can be controlled. Additives
with distinct characteristics such as electron donor/acceptors or
polymeric/small conjugated molecules interfere in the nanostructure
mechanism of formation, resulting in distinct structures, showing
that the self-assembling process is driven by the influence each additive
exerts on the dominant interaction forces. In solvent THF, MEH-PPV
moieties favor vesicle formation, whereas when the additive is a carbazole
derivative, nanotubes are obtained. On the other hand, when water
is the solvent, nanotubes are obtained even when MPS-PPV (a water-soluble
derivative similar, in structure, to MEH-PPV) is the additive. This
result reinforces that water exerts a dominant influence on Phe–Phe
self-assembling through electrostatic interactions with the amino
and carboxyl end-groups of the peptide, favoring the aromatic ring
π-stacking interactions between Phe–Phe molecules, in
such a way that only hexagonal nanotubes are generated. These conclusions
are corroborated by the computational simulations in which Phe–Phe
zwitterion HOMO and LUMO are more delocalized in solvents and present
shorter band gaps, suggesting that the self-assembling is initially
driven by trimers through electrostatic interactions that orient the
second step involving π-stacking interactions.

With regard
to the fluorescence spectral characteristics of each
system, they are distinct from their precursors. The influence of
molecular weight was evaluated by comparing the morphologies of systems
produced with 9Cz and PVK. It is noteworthy that only nanotubes were
obtained, revealing that the dominant interaction with the peptide
is related to the electron acceptor characteristic rather than the
chain length. Yet, their steady-state and time-resolved fluorescent
responses evidence the charge-transfer complex formation between the
additive and the self-assembled peptide. Excitation and fluorescence
spectra of Sm3 and Sm5 are distinct of 9Cz and PVK, showing the influence
of Phe–Phe in the electronic excited states. Yet, Sm3 showed
a broad and excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence, which is
also indicative of a charge-transfer complex.

Fluorescence lifetimes
recorded for Sm3 evidenced a distinct dynamic
behavior, compared to the individual components, because of the complex
formation, which occurs to stabilize the electronic excited states
of shorter lifetimes and destabilize the longer-lived excited states.
It is related to an alteration of the population of triplet states
of 9Cz when it is part of the complex with Phe–Phe. On the
other hand, fluorescence lifetimes of Sm5 resulted in a biexponential
behavior, which is the evidence for the Phe–Phe/PVK interaction
in a complex.

Steady-state fluorescence spectra of systems Sm2
and Sm4 are also
peculiar and distinct of those recorded for the individual components.
Excitation upon shorter wavelengths produces, along with more energetic
luminescence, emission in the characteristic region of MEH-PPV (or
MPS-PPV) moieties, although of low intensity. This mixed emission
spectrum suggests that a hopping process occurs and, therefore, the
charge-transfer complex formation between the polymer and the peptide
structure occurs in a nanotube or vesicle-like form. Fluorescence
lifetimes measurements evidenced electronic excited states more stabilized
in Sm2 and Sm4 than in MEH-PPV or MPS-PPV alone, which evidences the
complex formation.

It is a breakthrough of this work that these
results show that
Phe–Phe nanotubes can be generated in organic solvent, taking
advantage of their ability to interconvert, avoiding humidity in the
inner part of the nanotube, which is undesired in photovoltaic devices.
Also, Phe–Phe combination with luminescent compounds results
in new materials with unique photophysical properties that can be
widely exploited in this application field.

Experimental Methods
Sample
Preparation
Phe–Phe (Sigma-Aldrich) was
self-assembled in a liquid phase, in an Eppendorf flask, from a mixture
of its solution in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFP) (Aldrich)
with the additive solution prepared in the adequate solvent. Detailed
preparation protocols are presented below, and chemical structures
are presented in Figure 18.

(B) MEH-PPV, (C) 9Cz,
(D) MPS-PPV, and (E) PVK.

9-Vinyl-9H-carbazole solution in THF: (1.95
±
0.01) mg of 9Cz, Mw = 193.244 g mol–1 (98% pure, Sigma-Aldrich), was dissolved in 10 mL
of THF (Tedia, spectroscopic grade) to produce a 10–4 mol L–1 solution, which was, then, diluted to
10–6 mol L–1.

MEH-PPV-MEH-PPV
in THF: (2.20 ± 0.01) mg of MEH-PPV, Mw = 125 000 Da, Mn/Mw = 5 (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved
in 10 mL of THF (Tedia, spectroscopic grade) to produce 10–2 g L–1 solution.

Poly(9Cz)—PVK in
THF: (1.68 ± 0.01) mg of poly(9Cz)
(PVK), Mn = 25 000–50 000
g mol–1, and Mn/Mw = 2 (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 10 mL
of THF (Tedia, spectroscopic grade), and a 10–2 g
L–1 solution was obtained.

System Sm1—Phe–Phe
structures produced in THF: (0.53
± 0.01) mg of Phe–Phe was dissolved in 200 μL of
HFP (Aldrich) in an Eppendorf flask, and 10 μL of this solution
was placed over a glass substrate together with 10 μL of THF.
The glass substrate was placed in an oven at 45 °C for 30 min
to promote the solvent removal, and it was sealed and stored at 6
°C. Simultaneously, 200 μL of THF was placed in an Eppendorf
flask initially containing the Phe–Phe solution, and it was
also stored under refrigeration.

System Sm2—Phe–Phe
structures produced in THF with
MEH-PPV as the additive: (0.55 ± 0.01) mg of Phe–Phe was
dissolved in 200 μL of HFP in an Eppendorf flask. A 10 μL
aliquot of this solution was placed over a glass substrate, and immediately,
the same volume of the MEH-PPV solution previously prepared was added
to it. This glass substrate was also placed in an oven at 45 °C
for 30 min for solvent removal and stored at 6 °C. Also, 200
μL of the MEH-PPV solution was placed in an Eppendorf flask
containing the Phe–Phe solution and stored at 6 °C.

System Sm3—Phe–Phe structures produced in THF with
9-vinyl-9H-carbazole as the additive: (0.52 ±
0.01) mg of Phe–Phe was dissolved in 200 μL of HFP. A
10 μL aliquot of this solution was placed over a glass substrate
with another 10 μL of 9-vinyl-9H-carbazole
solution. The solvent was removed, and the substrate was stored. Also,
200 μL of the 9Cz solution was placed in an Eppendorf flask
containing the Phe–Phe solution, and it was stored at 6 °C.

System Sm4—Phe–Phe structures produced in water and
MPS-PPV as the additive: the mass of (0.55 ± 0.01) mg of Phe–Phe
was dissolved in 200 μL of HFP. A 10 μL aliquot of this
solution was placed over a glass substrate along with 10 μL
of 10–4 g L–1 of MPS-PPV potassium
salt in water, prepared from the dilution of the commercial solution
0.25/wt % in water (Sigma-Aldrich). The solvent was removed in an
oven at 45 °C for 48 h and, then, stored at 6 °C. The system
was also prepared in an Eppendorf flask by taking 200 μL of
the MPS-PPV solution and adding it to a Phe–Phe solution and
left to self-assemble. It was stored at low temperature.

System
Sm5—Phe–Phe structures produced in THF with
PVK as the additive: (0.53 ± 0.01) mg of Phe–Phe was dissolved
in 200 μL of HFP. A 10 μL aliquot of this solution was
placed over a glass substrate, and immediately, the same volume of
the 10–2 g L–1 PVK solution was
added to it. The solvent was removed in an oven at 45 °C for
30 min and stored at 6 °C. Then, 200 μL of the PVK solution
was added to the Eppendorf flask containing the Phe–Phe solution
to self-assemble.

Characterization
Scanning electronic
micrographs were
recorded in a SEM JEOL, JSM-6610 microscope, coupled to energy-dispersion
energy Thermo scientific NSS Spectral Imaging. A Denton Vacuum, Desk
V was used for gold layer deposition.

Steady-state excitation
and fluorescence spectra were recorded in a Fluorolog 3-221 HORIBA
Jobin Yvon spectrophotometer, with a 450 W Xe arc-lamp, connected
to a double monochromator, with a sample holder adapted for solid
samples, in which glass substrates were placed in a 45° right
angle with respect to the incident radiation. Emission was detected
at 90° by a Hamamatsu photomultiplier, operating at the range
of 250–850 nm. Narrow slits were employed to ensure the resolution
of 1.0 nm to the measurements. Data from steady-state spectroscopy
performed for all samples inform about the energies of excitation
and emission of each system, and they are used to determine the emission
region in which the fluorescence lifetime should be examined.

TRES was performed under time-correlated single photon counting
(TCSPC) measurements and were carried out in a Horiba FluoroMax 4
equipped with a TCSPC hub and NanoLEDs of 345 and 375 nm, with a pulse
width of typically 70 ps and with a maximum width of less than 200
ps. Measurements were performed in 4096 channels, which result in
time resolutions varying from 3.7 to 4.2 ps for samples presented
in this work. They were used to register fluorescence lifetimes in
distinct range of wavelengths, determined by the steady-state fluorescence
and excitation spectra, but typically at the range of 360–420
nm for the Sm1 sample consisting solely of Phe–Phe self-assembled
structures; 360–600 nm for samples containing PPV derivatives
as additives (Sm2 and Sm4) and of 360–450 nm for samples containing
carbazole derivatives as additives (Sm3 and Sm5). Samples were purged
with N2(g) for O2(g) removal and then submitted
to dynamic vacuum to be sealed in quartz cuvettes. They were placed
in the sample holder to register the fluorescence lifetimes. Data
collected for each sample and the instrumental response were deconvoluted
and analyzed by the exponential series method. For deconvolution,
LUDOX (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a scatterer. Experimental data correspond
to expected theoretical values when the exponential fit adjustment
parameter (χ2) is close to 1.70

Computational Simulations
Theoretical
calculations
were performed using three units of the Phe–Phe monomer. Phe–Phe
trimers in neutral and zwitterion forms were optimized at the AM1
semiempirical level of calculation, and the equilibrium geometries
were characterized by vibrational frequencies. The calculations were
performed in vacuum, THF, and water. Solvent effects were introduced
taking into account the polarized continuum model,71−73 considering
water and THF as the environment. All calculations were performed
by Gaussian 09 software package.74
