We investigated the
crystal structure and magnetic structure in
cobaltite-platinate double perovskite of La2CoPtO6, employing various techniques of X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction,
and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. It is shown
that the crystal symmetry is maintained as P21/n in the temperature range of <500 °C,
whereas the lattice constants and the Co–Co distances undergo
a continuous structural evolution toward the high-symmetry phases
with increasing temperature. The Co–O bonds were overall longer
and had a larger degree of structural and thermal disorders than the
Pt–O bonds. As for the magnetism, an antiferromagnetic order
is stabilized in the Co2+ sublattice at temperatures below
28 K. It is demonstrated that owing to the substantial distortions
(quantified by a distortion parameter Σ > 0.03 Å) of
the
Co–Co networks, the system is not subject to spin frustration
effect. Details in the magnetic structure are determined; at 12 K,
the Co magnetic moment was (0.8, 0, 2.7) Bohr magneton, the magnetic
propagation vector was (−0.5, 0, 0.5), and the magnetic symmetry
was preferably Γ1(Ag).

1 Introduction
Double perovskite (DP)
A2BB′O6 (A:
alkali or rare-earth ions and B/B′: transition-metal ions)
has drawn attention because of its various electronic and/or magnetic
functionalities including half metallicity for spintronics,1,2 multiferroicity,3,4 or photocatalysis.5 Compared to simple perovskite ABO3, the inherent
disproportionation of charges and spins in the alternatingly mixed
B and B′ sites can allow us to control such multifunctionality
by choosing the ionic species for the B/B′ site.1,2 Of particular interest would be to explore a new crystal structure
and/or spin ordering in artificially engineered compositions.1,2,6

When B and B′ ions
in DP interact strongly with each other,
magnetism in DP is driven predominantly by the B–B′
interaction. For instance, in the case of Sr2FeMoO6, a ferromagnetic order is stabilized by the nonlocal interaction
between the d electrons in Fe2+ and Mo4+ (ref (2)). However, when either
one is inactive (i.e., nonmagnetic), the interaction among the B ions
within the sublattice mostly determines the magnetic order in spite
of the long B–B distance (typically above 5 Å).

In a perfect high-symmetry DP (for the schematic, see the left
panel in Figure 1),
B and B′ sublattices constitute the NaCl-like double face-centered-cubic
(fcc) structure.7,8 It has been reported in many DPs
having inactive B′ that ordering of the B spins tends to be
frustrated because of the symmetric geometry in the fcc network.9−11 However, when the structural distortion is significant, the fcc
network can become asymmetric, and thus, the magnetic order can be
reinstated.12,13 Indeed, it has been observed
in DPs with various A ions that the spin ordering is associated with
the structural distortion, which is tunable due to different ionic
sizes of the A site ions.1

Figure 1 Crystal structure of
La2CoPtO6 double perovskite
(P21/n, right) and the
aristo-type double perovskite (Fm3̅m, no distortion, left). The actual crystal (right) undergoes
the structural distortions so as to unequalize the Co–Co distances
in the tetrahedral network (middle). The arrows on the vertices of
the tetrahedron show the directions of the 4 Co magnetic moments exemplarily
following the Γ1(Ag) model. Σ, the
variance of the six Co–Co bond lengths, is used as a measure
of distortion of the tetrahedral network. The spin frustration effects
can be suppressed when Σ > 0.

This study focused on examining the structure and magnetic
orders
of a novel platinate DP, La2CoPtO6. Structural
study on platinate DP has been rarely reported so far, simply because
of the difficulty in the synthesis.14,15 We chose La2CoPtO6 to study the magnetism of the Co spins.
Compared to the high-symmetry DPs such as cubic Ba2YRuO6 (Fm3̅m; ref (9)) or tetragonal Sr2CoOsO6 (I4/m; refs (16) and (17)), in which spin orders
in Ru or Co ions are frustrated, La2CoPtO6 has
a distorted crystal structure (P21/n), which might stabilize the magnetism in the sublattices
of B–B′ sites.

It was shown in our previous reports18,19 that the oxidation
number of Pt is +4, whereas that of Co is +2 in La2CoPtO6. Because the total spin of Pt 5d electrons should be null,
only the spin interaction between the Co2+ ions can dominate
the magnetic ordering. Also, Co2+ ions are prone to show
a peculiar magnetoelastic property because of strong spin–orbit
coupling.20 Furthermore, to the extent
of our knowledge, there have been no reports on the magnetic structure
of platinate DPs. Therefore, we studied in details the crystal structure
and the spin ordering in novel La2CoPtO6 using
various techniques for structural identification: X-ray diffraction
(XRD) for crystal structure, extended X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) analyses for local structures of Co/Pt, and neutron diffraction
(ND) for the magnetic structure at low temperature.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystal Structure
Figure 1 shows the
crystal structure
of La2CoPtO6. As in many other double perovskites,1,7 the crystal symmetry of La2CoPtO6 was determined
to be monoclinic (P21/n, right panel), that is, lowered from Fm3̅m for aristo-type DP (left panel) due to octahedral rotations
and distortions. The results of the XRD analyses (Figures 2 and 3) show that the P21/n symmetry is preserved up to at least 773 K, suggesting persistent
structural distortions even at temperatures far above the room temperature.

Figure 2 XRD data
taken at temperatures from 4 to 773 K. The P21/n symmetry is preserved for all of
the temperatures. The asterisks show the signature of segregated Pt
(less than 3% of the sample). Miller indices (hkl)’s according to the P21/n symmetry are given in the figure.

(b) lattice constants in pseudo-cubic notations (apc), and (c) monoclinic angle β. (d) Distances between
the four Co ions, that is, the vertices in the tetrahedron shown in Figure 1. (e) Variance of
the Co–Co bond lengths () as a measure of the distortion of the
Co tetrahedron. The large values of Σ’s (>0.03 Å)
at low temperatures suggest a substantial distortion of the Co tetrahedral
networks, which can break up the frustration condition for the Co
spin order.

In regard to the magnetism
of the double perovskite, particular
interest is on the network of the 4 Co spins depicted in the figure.
Because La or Pt has no spin magnetic moments, the magnetism is determined
solely by the intersite interactions of the Co 3d. The Co ions occupy
the fcc sublattices, so they interact with each other through the
network of indirect Co–Co bonds (with bond lengths ∼5.6
Å), which comprises the edge-sharing tetrahedra. The intersite
interactions are dominated by the superexchange interactions, favoring
an antiferromagnetic coupling (spins tend to be aligned in the opposite
directions). The exchanges between each of the 4 Co ions [Coi (i = 1–4)] are denoted by JCoi–Coj’s (>0). Generally, JCo–Co increases as the Co–Co distance decreases.

In the Fm3̅m structure,
the bond lengths of the six edges in the tetrahedron (shown in Figure 1) are all identical
and so are the JCo–Co’s.
Under the circumstance, the 4 Co spins in the tetrahedron (shown in
the middle of Figure 1) cannot be aligned antiparallel all together. Instead, at least
one of them should align parallel, which might suppress the magnetic
order. This is the spin frustration effect in the case of ideally
symmetric fcc network.

On the other hand, in the actual monoclinic
crystal (P21/n), the
tetrahedron is distorted so
as to possess 4 different Co–Co bond lengths; 4 out of 6 bond
lengths forms two pairs of bonds with the same length. For instance,
Co1–Co2 and Co4–Co2 bonds form a pair of bonds with
an identical length, and Co1–Co3 and Co4–Co3 bonds form
the other pair of bonds. The bonds are colored in Figure 1 according to the bond lengths.
A good measure to quantify the degree of the tetrahedral distortion
is the variance of the six bond lengths (), where dij is the distance between Coi and
Coj and ⟨d⟩ is the
average. As Σ increases, the asymmetry of the tetrahedron and
the resultant inequality in JCo–Co’s become severe. This suggests that a preferential spin orientation
can be settled, breaking up the spin frustration when Σ >
0
under the tetrahedral distortion in the P21/n symmetry.

2.2 X-ray
Diffraction
In order to identify
the crystal structure of La2CoPtO6, XRD was
carried out at various temperatures. Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns taken at 4–773
K. Overall peaks can be assigned to the (hkl) reflections
according to the P21/n symmetry, except for the small contribution of segregated Pt (<3%),
which is irrelevant to the double perovskite. As the temperature increases,
some of the peaks [for instance, (220) and (024)] appear to merge
and become more intense. We checked a possibility of phase transition
into higher crystal symmetry. Upon the continuous structural phase
transition, the monoclinic P21/n group can be derived only from either C2/m or P4/mnc supergroup.7 Therefore, it is probable to undergo a continuous
transition to the higher symmetry structures with increasing temperature.
However, the two groups are not consistent with the presence of (11–1)/(111)
peak near 2θ = 25°, which exists at all the temperatures,
as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, we can tell that the crystal symmetry of La2CoPtO6 is maintained as P21/n for all the temperatures.

Then, the apparent
merging of peaks at high temperatures can be understood as the signature
of a continuous symmetrization of the lattices while preserving the P21/n symmetry. Figure 3 shows the structure parameters
obtained from the XRD results. The unit cell volume V, the lattice constants in pseudo-cubic notations apc, and the monoclinic angle β are displayed in Figure 3a–c, respectively.
With increasing temperature, the three lattice constants tend to become
similar to each other and β approaches to 90°. This reflects
a continuous thermal evolution of the crystal structure toward a higher-entropy
phase (but still preserving the P21/n symmetry).

Because Co and Pt occupy 2c and 2d special positions in the P21/n symmetry, respectively, dij values can be calculated
directly from the values
of apc and β. Figure 2d,e shows, respectively, the dij’s and Σ at various temperatures.
All of the dij’s
tend to increase as the temperature increases because of thermal expansion.
Their variance, Σ decreases again reflecting a continuous structural
evolution toward the high-symmetry phases. For comparison, the data
obtained by the ND (Figures 7 and 8) are appended for the respective
figures in Figure 3. The results from ND are very consistent with those from XRD.

It is noteworthy that at low temperature, the value of Σ
becomes saturated to the highest value (0.0308 Å) (see Table 2). We can tell that
the temperature evolution of Σ is significant, in that it increases
two times as temperature decreases (773 K → 12 K). The substantial
structural distortion can hinder the spin frustration allowing a long-ranged
magnetism at low temperature, which is indeed the case in La2CoPtO6.

2.3 Extended X-Ray Absorption
Fine Structure
Generally, atomic structures estimated by
diffraction techniques
are described in reciprocal space so that only the structures of atoms
that are arranged periodically can be identified. Thus, it is rather
difficult to directly observe short-ranged orders or instant vibration
of chemical bonds and so forth. Meanwhile, such local structural information,
complementary to the information on long-ranged orders, can be provided
by EXAFS. In the EXAFS analyses, oscillatory fine structures (χ(k)) in the higher energy region in the X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) spectra are deduced as functions of the final-state
electron momentum (k). Furthermore, Fourier transformation
(FT) of the χ(k)’s provides the real
space information on the atomic arrangements near the photon absorbing
atom with respect to the phase uncorrected interatomic distance R. The signals from each of the atomic species can be collected
separately by selecting the edges (or the range of photon energies
used in the XAS measurement).

Figure 4 shows the χ(k)’s
multiplied by k2 obtained at (a) Co K-
and (b) Pt L3-edges. The horizontal dashed lines are the
guides for the eyes, indicating the zero values. Overall, the line
shapes and positions of crests and troughs in χ(k)’s are almost independent of the measurement temperature.
Meanwhile, the amplitudes of χ(k)’s
decreases with increasing temperature particularly at high k’s. This can be attributed to the structural or
thermal disorders (σ2) in the coordination [χ(k) ∝ exp(−2k2σ2)].

Figure 4 (a) Co K-edge and (b) Pt L3-edge EXAFS oscillations
χ(k) weighted by k2 at various temperatures. The magnitudes of their FT data are displayed
with the simulated FT EXAFSs for Co(Pt)–O/La/Pt(Co) in (c,d).
The bond lengths appear to be almost constants of temperature, whereas
the peak intensities decrease with increasing temperature because
of thermal disorders in bond lengths. The horizontal dashed lines
in (a,b) are guides for the eyes, and the vertical dashed lines in
(c,d) show the R range for the disorder analyses
in Figure 5.

The FT magnitudes at Co K- and
Pt L3-edges are shown
as functions of R in Figure 4c,d, respectively. The FT was processed on k2χ(k) within a k range of 2–10 Å–1. The FT
magnitudes in Figure 4c,d show overall information of the bonding of Co and Pt, respectively,
on the order of increasing bond length. The peaks can be assigned
to bonds according to R’s; the main peaks
near R = 1.5 Å can be attributed to the Co/Pt–O
bonds, whereas the smaller peaks at higher R’s
can be attributed to the bonds with adjacent La or Pt/Co. For clear
peak assignments, the simulated FT spectra for Co–O, Co–La,
and Co–Pt single scatterings are appended in Figure 4c and those for Pt–O,
Pt–La, and Pt–Co are done in Figure 4d, as well. It is shown that the features
of Co(Pt)–La/Pt(Co) overlap with each other and are likely
masked by the FT ripples as well as by the contributions of the multiple
scatterings, such as Co–O–O–Co or Pt–O–La–Pt.
This hinders an accurate peak assignment for the higher R region (>2 Å).

The R values of the
Co/Pt–O bonding appear
to be almost constants of temperature, suggesting that the average
bond lengths hardly change with temperature at least below room temperature.
However, the peak intensities gradually decrease with increasing temperature.
This indicates the increase of the values of σ2’s
because the coordination number of Co–O and Pt–O is
fixed as 6 under the P21/n crystal structure.

Figure 5 shows the values of σ2’s for
Co–O and Pt–O bonds obtained by fitting the first shell
peaks (R = 1–2 Å as highlighted by the
vertical dashed lines in Figure 4b) at various temperatures. Note that the values of
σ2’s would correspond to the variance in bond
length in the direction of −O bonds. If we presume that the
oxygen ions are frozen (without any structural disorders), the values
should be comparable with the Biso values
obtained by the Rietveld refinement of the ND data (in Table 1) divided by 8π2. The σ2’s for Co–O are somewhat large
(∼0.010 Å) compared to those for Pt–O (∼0.006
Å). This might be relevant to a minute site-to-site variation
in the atomic position of Co2+ ions, which are subject
to a magnetostriction effect due to spin–orbit coupling.20 As the temperature increases, the σ2’s for Co–O increase noticeably, whereas those
for Pt–O remains almost constant. The selective increase of
σ2’s can be attributed to the fact that the
mass of Co2+ ion should be smaller than that of Pt4+ ion; the lighter ion would vibrate more easily than the
heavier ion.

Figure 5 Parameter for structural disorders in average Co–O
and Pt–O
bond lengths (σ2), estimated by EXAFSs from the first
shells (with R range of 1.0–2.0 Å). The
σ2’s for Co–O are overall larger and
increase more rapidly with increasing temperature than those for Pt–O
for all of the temperatures.

2.4 Magnetism
Magnetic susceptibility
(χm = M/H) of La2CoPtO6 is displayed in Figure 6 as a function of temperature. The specimen
was first cooled down without external magnetic field (H; namely, zero-field cooling), then χm was measured
under H = 5000 Oe. The cusp in the χm curve suggests existence of an antiferromagnetic order with a Néel
temperature (TN) of 28 K. The reciprocal
(1/χm) is also shown in the inset. The extrapolation
from the slope at the high-temperature range (200–400 K) to
the abscissa shows that the Weiss temperature (Θ) is ∼−28
K. The effective magnetic moment μeff is estimated
to be approximately 4.72 μB, which is larger than
the value from the spin-only value of 2  for S = 3/2.
The increment
in μeff might reflect the contribution of unquenched
orbital moment because of distortion of the CoO6 octahedra.
The ratio f = |Θ|/TN is 1, which implies that the spins are not frustrated in La2CoPtO6.

Figure 6 Magnetic susceptibility (χm = M/H) with an external magnetic
field of H = 5000 Oe, measured after the zero-field
cooling. The cusp in the
χm curve shows the antiferromagnetic order with a
Néel temperature (TN) of 28 K.
The reciprocal (1/χm) is shown in the inset, and
the extrapolation from the slope at high-temperature range to the
abscissa shows that the Weiss temperature (Θ) is ∼−28
K. Thus, the ratio f = |Θ|/TN ≈ 1. This implies the absence of spin frustration
effects in La2CoPtO6.

2.5 Neutron Diffraction
Figure 7a shows the t.o.f. ND patterns at low temperatures (≤130
K). Besides the peaks from the crystal structures (persistent for
all of the temperatures), magnetic peaks emerge near d = 4.8 Å and d = 9.1 Å at temperatures
below 35 K. In the inset, the diffraction patterns in 12 and 130 K
data are shown together to highlight their correlation with the antiferromagnetic
order. The magnetic peaks are assigned to (hkl)m = (±0.5, 1, −0.5) and (−0.5, 0, ±0.5),
respectively, where the magnetic indices (hkl)m are the sum of the nuclei’s indices (hkl)n and the indices for the magnetic propagation vector K⃗. K⃗ is defined as the
reciprocals of the periodicity of the magnetic moments; for incidence,
the magnetic propagation vector in La2CoPtO6 is determined to be (−1/2, 0, 1/2) in this work (see the
spin structures in Figure 9), that is, the same spins can be found at sites generated
by a translation vector (−2a, 0, 2c).

Figure 7 (a) ND patterns at low temperatures (≤130 K). Besides
the
peaks from the crystal structures, magnetic peaks emerge near d = 4.8 Å and d = 9.1 Å at temperatures
below ∼28 K. In the inset, the diffraction patterns in the
12 and 130 K data are shown together to highlight their magnetic origins.
The magnetic peaks are assigned to (hkl)m = (±0.5, 1, −0.5) and (−0.5, 0, ±0.5). (b)
Peak intensities of the two magnetic peaks at various temperatures.

The peak intensities of the two
magnetic peaks are plotted as functions
of temperature in Figure 7b. Seeing the sudden increase in intensity at temperature
near 28 K as the temperature decreases, it is obvious that those peaks
are indeed relevant to the antiferromagnetic order. The results of
the Rietveld refinement on the ND data are summarized in Figure 8 and Tables 1 and 2. Figure 8 shows the (a) Co–O
and (b) Pt–O bond lengths and (c) the Co–O–Pt
bond angles at low temperatures. Although the lengths of bonds to
oxygen are all different from each other, they are almost constants
of temperature in the temperature range, suggesting rigidity in the
structural distortion (P21/n).

bond angles at low temperatures from the ND data. No significant structural
change is observed upon increasing the temperature.

It should be noted that the average
bond length of Co–O
is larger than that of Pt–O in spite of much smaller atomic
number. This can be attributed mainly to smaller valence of Co2+ in comparison to Pt4+. The Co–O1 and Co–O2
bond lengths are found to be almost identical, whereas that of Co–O3
is approximately 0.1 Å smaller, constituting CoO6 octahedra
of a D4h-like point symmetry
shortened along the c axis. On the other hand, the
lengths of the Pt–O1, O2, and O3 bonds are all different from
each other but the differences are not severe. The bigger size and
anisotropy in CoO6 might be related to the larger disorders
in Co–O bonds shown in the results of the EXAFS analyses (Figures 4 and 5).

Table 1 shows the
structural parameters for several temperatures. Co occupies 2c positions [(0, 1/2, 0) and (1/2, 0,1/2)], and Pt occupies
2d positions [(1/2, 0, 0) and (0, 1/2, 1/2)]. There
are three oxygen sites; O1 and O2 atoms connect the Co and Pt atoms
in ab plane, whereas O3 atoms do along c axis. The magnetic moments at Co sites [(Co_a,
Co_b, Co_c)] are also determined.
The magnetic moment of Co2+ at 12 K was estimated to be
(0.8, 0, 2.7) μB with a total magnetic moment of
2.8 μB. The y value of the magnetic
moment is so small (<0.3 μB) as to hinder to obtain
a reliable value. Thus, we fixed Co_b = 0 within
our magnetic models during Rietveld refinement. The Biso’s represent the isotropic terms for the thermal ellipsoid,
comparable with the σ2’s obtained from the
EXAFS analysis (Figure 5).

Bond lengths, angles, and the distortion parameter Σ
(defined
in Figures 1 and 3) at given temperatures are listed in Table 2. Being related to the spin
frustration, the fact that Σ is maximized at low temperatures
(see Figure 3e) implies
that the structural distortions are substantial at low temperature,
which, in turn, can allow the system to have a preferred magnetic
order. Thereby, the frustration effects of the Co spins can be suppressed
in La2CoPtO6.

The complete magnetic structure
can be obtained by measuring the
magnetic propagation vector and the magnetic point symmetry. The former
tells the periodicity of the magnetic moments over the unit cell,
whereas the latter does the relationship between the two Co ions (in
2c positions in P21/n) in the same unit cell. It is shown by the Rietveld refinement
that the magnetic propagation vector is (−0.5, 0, 0.5). According
to the magnetic symmetry analysis, there are two magnetic structure
candidates for Co sites under the magnetic propagation vector; they
are Γ1(Ag) and Γ3(Bg). Γ1(Ag) dictates that if the
magnetic moment at (0, 0.5, 0) is (Ma, Mb, Mc), that at (0.5,
0, 0.5) should be (−Ma, Mb, –Mc), namely, a ferromagnetic
ordering along b axis and an antiferromagnetic ordering
along a axis and/or c axis within
the crystal unit cell. On the contrary, in the case of Γ3(Bg), the magnetic moment at (0.5, 0, 0.5) should
be (Ma, −Mb, Mc) instead, so that an antiferromagnetic ordering
along b axis and a ferromagnetic ordering along a axis and/or c axis within the crystal
unit cell. Despite the ferromagnetic ordering between the magnetic
moments at (0, 0.5, 0) and (0.5, 0, 0.5), the net magnetic moment
over the magnetic unit cell must be zero for both the Γ1(Ag) and Γ3(Bg) symmetries
because the translations either by (a, 0, 0) or (0,
0, c) will cancel out all of the magnetic moments
due to the magnetic propagation vector (−0.5, 0, 0.5).

The results of the Rietveld refinement for the 12 K data are plotted
in Figure 9. For the determination of the magnetic structures,
we used the 30° band data instead of the 90° bank data because
it covers a broader d range, which is needed for
the analysis of the magnetic peaks with longer periodicity. The upper
(lower) left panels show the experimental ND pattern and the theoretical
pattern calculated based on the Γ1(Ag)
(Γ3(Bg)) model. The magnetic structures
of the two models are appended in the right panels beside their respective
ND patterns. Except for the difference highlighted by the arrows in
the insets, the theoretical ND patterns appear very similar to each
other. Therefore, the quality of the fit (Rmag) of Γ1(Ag) is only slightly better than
that of Γ3(Bg).

Figure 9 Magnetic structure at
12 K from the 30° bank. The magnetic
propagation vectors were found to be (−0.5, 0, 0.5), and the
magnetic symmetry defining the relative orientations among the adjacent
magnetic moments is preferably Γ1(Ag)
rather than Γ3(Bg). The two spin orders
are displayed in the right panels. The insets and the arrows highlight
the small differences between the calculated ND patterns. See the
text for more details.

This suggests that it is difficult to unequivocally judge
from
the experimental data that only the Γ1(Ag) symmetry prevails. If the two models indeed coexisted, they presumably
reside in different magnetic domains. Possible coexistence of Γ1(Ag) and Γ3(Bg) might
suggest that ambiguity could still remain in determining the spin
directions for all of the Co sites even in the presence of long-ranged
antiferromagnetic order at 12 K (below TN).

Nevertheless, we can tell that the Γ1(Ag) model is slightly more favored as the magnetic ground state.
The
preference of the Γ1(Ag) model can be
rationalized by considering the exchange interactions of the 4 Co
spins in the tetrahedral networks as in Figure 1. Suppose the b axis components
of the Co magnetic moments (Co_b in Table 1) are negligible. Three out
of 4 (Co1, Co4, and Co3) has the same directions, whereas Co2 has
the opposite direction. Because of the magnetic propagation vector
of (−0.5, 0, 0.5), the spins of Co2 and Co3 should be antiparallel
to each other and those of Co1 and Co4 should also be parallel to
each other (see Figure 1).

However, the relative orientations between Co1 (Co4) and
Co2 (or
Co3) are not deterministic, but they can change delicately depending
on the competing two superexchange interactions (favoring antiparallel
spin alignments) of JCo2–Co4 and JCo3–Co4. If JCo2–Co4 is larger than JCo3–Co4, Co2
should align antiparallel to Co1 and Co4 and then Co3 should align
parallel unfavorably. On the contrary, if JCo3–Co4 is larger than JCo2–Co4, Co3
aligns antiparallel and then Co2 should align parallel. The strength
of exchange interaction is closely related to the Co–Co distance;
stronger exchange interaction for shorter bonds.

It is shown
in Figure 3 and Table 2, the Co2–Co4
(=Co2–Co1) distance is slightly
shorter than the Co3–Co4 (=Co3–Co1) for all of
the temperatures because the monoclinic angle β slightly exceeds
90°. This suggests that JCo2–Co4 is larger than JCo3–Co4, so that
the 4 Co magnetic moments follow the Γ1(Ag) model (as depicted in the middle panel of Figure 1). On the other hand, in the Γ3(Bg) model, the directions of magnetic moments
on Co2 and Co3 should be reversed, which is unfavorable. Therefore,
it is very reasonable for the Co spins to prefer the Γ1(Ag) symmetry.

It is noteworthy that although a
probability of existence of the
Γ3(Bg) symmetry is not excluded experimentally,
the antiferromagnetic order over the unit cells is clearly determined
as K⃗ = (−0.5, 0, 0.5) with expanding
the magnetic unit cells by 2 × 1 × 2 below the Néel
temperature. In this regard, we can tell that the magnetic order is
not frustrated (f = 1) in the cobaltite-platinate
DP.

3 Conclusions
Combined XRD + ND + EXAFS
study revealed the crystal and magnetic
structures of La2CoPtO6 in details. Although
the crystal symmetry is maintained as P21/n at least up to 773 K, the lattice parameters
tend to become symmetrized with increasing temperature, suggesting
a continuous structural evolution toward high-symmetry phases. The
Co–O bonds were overall longer and had a larger degree of structural
and thermal disorders than the Pt–O bonds. As for the magnetism,
an antiferromagnetic order is stabilized in the Co2+ sublattice
at T < 28 K, with the magnetic moment MCo = (0.8, 0, 2.7) μB (at 12
K), the magnetic propagation vector of (−0.5, 0, 0.5), and
the magnetic symmetry of Γ1(Ag) (preferentially).
Substantial degree of structural distortions in the tetrahedral Co
networks (Σ > 0.03 Å) can explain the absence of spin
frustration
effect (|Θ|/TN = 1) and the resultant
antiferromagnetic ordering in La2CoPtO6.

4 Experimental/Materials and Methods
A La2CoPtO6 powder sample was prepared by
a solid-state reaction method.18 A mixture
of La2O3, Co3O4, and PtO2 was sintered at 900–1150 °C for several days
with intermediate grinding. It is observed in the XRD and ND data
that a small amount of Pt (<3%) were segregated. However, the average
valence of Pt is 4 + predominantly,19 suggesting
that the segregation effects hardly alter the chemistry or crystal
structure of main double perovskite.

XRD was conducted at various
temperatures (4–773 K) using
Rigaku SmartLab (Cu Kα1). The t.o.f. neutron powder
diffraction was carried out at temperatures below 130 K on ∼4
g of the specimen in the SuperHRPD beamline in J-PARC.21,22 The space group and lattice constants are determined from both the
XRD and ND data.

For the analyses of the XRD and ND data, we
employed Z-Rietveld23,24 and Fullprof.25 The atomic coordinates
and the bond information including Pt–O bond lengths or Co–O–Pt
bond angles were obtained by processing the Rietveld refinement on
the ND data collected from the 90° bank. For the magnetic structure
analyses, the data were collected from the 30° bank and the symmetry
analyses were performed employing SARAH program.26

For the EXAFS analyses, hard XAS was performed at
the 17C1 beamline
in Taiwan Light Source in the transmission mode. The EXAFS procedures
including the background removal and the FT were undergone using UWXAFS
package.27 The magnetic susceptibility
was measured by using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design) in CROSS-Tokai.
