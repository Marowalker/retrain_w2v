Two new Ru(II)-based complexes containing
2-thiouracil derivatives,
known as 2-thiouracil (2TU) and 6-methyl-2-thiouracil (6m2TU), were
synthesized using cis,trans-[RuCl2(PPh3)2(bipy)] as a precursor. The obtained compounds
with a general formula trans-[Ru(2TU)(PPh3)2(bipy)]PF6 (1) and trans-[Ru(6m2TU)(PPh3)2(bipy)]PF6 (2) were characterized by analytical techniques such as NMR,
UV–vis, and IR spectroscopies, elementary analysis, mass spectrometry,
and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Moreover, the investigation
of the complexes–DNA interaction were carried out using spectrophotometric
titrations and showed that the complexes present a weak interaction
with this biomolecule. The compounds were evaluated against HL-60,
K-562, HepG2, and B16-F10 cancer cells and against noncancer cells
(PBMCs). The results of the biological assay revealed that complex 2 is more promising than complex 1. Finally,
the present study suggests that complexes 1 and 2 causes cell death by apoptosis, significantly increasing
the percentage of apoptotic HL-60 cells, in which the compounds altered
the cell cycle, reducing the cells in G1/G0,
G2/M, and S phases.

Introduction
Uracil is a well-known
pyrimidine nucleobase used as an RNA building
block. Pyrimidines and purine derivatives comprise an important molecular
framework to drug design, in which structural modifications on nucleobase
derivatives can lead to the formation of compounds with pharmacological
properties.1,2 An example involving purine is 6-mercaptopurine
(6-MP), an antineoplastic drug that acts as an antimetabolite agent.3,4 Concerning the uracil moiety, a widely studied compound called 5-fluorouracil
(5FU) has also been used as an anticancer drug.5,6 Besides
the molecular modification in the molecule ring, special attention
has been directed toward the coordination of 5-fluorouracil and derivatives
with transition metals.7−9 As a consequence, many compounds containing these
classes of molecules have been obtained to exhibit different physicochemical
properties, and thus able to alter the effectiveness of the drug.10−13 Therefore, from the coordination point of view, several strategies
in preparative inorganic chemistry have been widely investigated to
coordinate a bioligand with a metal center to increase their biological
potential.14−16

Recently, we have reported structural and biological
studies with
cationic Ru(II)-thymine and Ru(II)-5-fluorouracil complexes, and their
promising properties such as metallodrug candidates, with high cytotoxic
against cancer cells, have led to further studies in vivo.8 Moreover, neutral ruthenium(II)-based complexes
containing two 2-thiouracil derivative ligands per metal center have
been recently investigated, presenting promising results, mainly against
leukemia HL-60 cells.17 Goitia and co-workers
have reported that gold(I)/complex with 2-thiouracil exhibits excellent
cytotoxic activity against PC-12 and NIH-3T3 cell lines.18 Thus, having in mind that Ru(II) complexes have
been investigate in the development of compounds with anticancer properties,
to evaluate the structural modification on biological properties of
ruthenium complexes with 2-thiouracil derivatives, we present here
the synthesis of two new monocationic complexes, expecting that they
will have good cytotoxicity against cancer cells.19−24

Results and Discussion
To obtain the desired complexes studied
here, cis,trans-[RuCl2(PPh3)2(bipy)] was used as
precursor, which was obtained following the procedures described by
Batista and co-workers.25 The synthetic
route of complexes 1 and 2 is represented
in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Route of
the Synthesis Used to Obtain Complexes 1 and 2
Given that there are few studies
of ruthenium(II)-based complexes
containing 2-thiouracil derivatives, the study of a new class of compound
was performed. Owing to fact that phosphinic ligands are able to stabilize
the metal center and the possibility of coordinating only one 2-thiouracil
ligands per metal center by exchanging two chloride ligands, giving
rise to cationic complexes, complexes 1 and 2 were rationally designed.

Complexes 1 and 2 were characterized
by physical and chemical techniques, especially X-ray crystallography.
In addition, the DNA-interaction studies were performed by UV–vis
spectrophotometric titration. Moreover, in vitro biological assays
against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human promyelocytic
leukemia (HL-60), human chronic myelocytic leukemia (K-562), and mouse
melanoma (B16-F10) were performed. Also, complexes 1 and 2 were tested against noncancer cells, known as human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells, activated with concanavalin A, a human lymphoblast
(PBMC).

The chemical versatility presented by thiouracil, or
analogous,
as a ligand has been attractive in the preparative inorganic chemistry
field. Thus, to explore the reactivity of these ligands, which still
remains underexplored in the literature, we used a precursor complex
that allows the exchange of two chlorido by one negatively charged
thiouracil-derived ligand, acting as a bidentate ligand. As a result,
one negative counterion is needed to stabilize the charge of the complex,
such as PF6–. The conductivity and elemental
analysis confirm this hypothesis, as do the 31P{1H} NMR experiments. As can be seen, the precursor cis,trans-[RuCl2(PPh3)2(bipy)] shows a singlet in the 31P{1H} spectrum
at 21.5 ppm, in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). On
the other hand, complexes 1 and 2 both present
just one singlet at 32.2 ppm. The signals in the same region strongly
suggest that complexes 1 and 2 show the
same stereochemistry. It can be observed that the 31P{1H} NMR signal in both complexes have little influence by changing
the 2TU ligand for the 6m2TU ligand. This behavior can occur because
the phosphorus atom is trans positioned to another one and is poorly
affected by the bipy and 2TU ligands located on the equatorial position
(see Scheme 1). Compared
with the other Ru(II)/phosphinic complexes previously studied, it
also reveals one singlet in the region of 30–35 ppm. On the
other hand, the phosphorus in the cis configuration is deshielded,
presenting chemical shifts around 50 ppm.26,27 The structures of complexes 1 and 2 change
after incubation with DMSO solvent. The chemical modification was
followed by 31P NMR experiments for compounds 1 and 2 (see the spectra in the Supporting Information (SI)). It is suggested that these changes may be
assigned to the exchange of one PPh3 ligand by one DMSO
molecule. In this way, the signal of PPh3 free is observed
at 6.77 ppm.

The Ru(II) complexes were also characterized by 1H NMR
studies (see SI). In the spectra for both
compounds, the region ranging from 7.0 to 7.6 ppm was assigned to
the hydrogen atoms of the PPh3 ligands, while the hydrogen
atoms of the bipy ligand occurred in the range of 11.5–7.7
ppm. For complex 1, the presence of a hydrogen linked
to an N1–H nitrogen of the 2TU ligand is observed at 12.2 ppm,
while the signals at 5.2 and 6.7 ppm are attributed to the H5 and
H6 atoms of 2TU, respectively. Important information to assign the
N–H signal was obtained by the two-dimensional hydrogen spectrum
(1H–1H COSY) (see SI). The 1H–1H COSY spectrum
of complex 1 reveals that there is a correlation between
the atom H6 and N1–H, as well as H6 and H5. Thus, the hydrogen
atom H1 of the N1 atom is present in the structure, suggesting that
the coordination occurred via N3–S, not via the N1–S
mode. This behavior differs from the Ru/2TU complexes previously reported.17

As proposed, the structures for complexes 1 and 2 include one thiouracil and one bipyridine
ligand, as well
as two PPh3 coordinated to Ru(II). Some comparisons with
the structure of the [Ru(2TU)2(PPh3)2] complex, previously reported17 can be
made. For example, the stereochemistry has changed and there is a
substitution of one thiouracil derivative by one bipyridine ligand,
leaving the metal center slightly electron deficient due to the greater
π-receptor character of bipyridine than that of the thiouracil
ligand. This aspect can be seen by the cyclic voltammetry and differential
pulse techniques. As a result of the π-receptor character of
bipyridine, complexes 1 and 2 present higher
redox potentials than the complexes [Ru(2TU)2(PPh3)2] without a bipy ligand.17 Cyclic and differential pulse voltammetries obtained for 1 and 2 reveal the Ru(II)/Ru(III) redox couple near 1000
mV, while the values found for the neutral complexes with two N–S
chelating ligands present redox potentials lower than 1000 mV (ranging
from 600 to 800 mV).28 This may be the
evidence that bipyridine-containing complexes are better stabilized
in the Ru(II) oxidation state.

Additionally, the complexes were
also characterized by high-resolution
mass experiments. Complexes 1 and 2 exhibit
peaks in 909.1531 and 923.1698 Da, respectively, assigned to the theoretical
values for M+ (909.1527 and 923.1684 Da for 1 and 2, respectively). The mass spectra obtained for 1 and 2 can identify signals that are assigned to the
M+-PPh3 species, which can be expected, given that the
PPh3 is monodentate and can be labialized.

The complexes
were studied by infrared absorption spectroscopy
(see Figures S10 and S11 and Table S3).
The band referring to υC=O stretching vibration changed
slightly compared with free ligands. In the free ligands, 2TU and
6m2TU present the υC=O stretching vibration at 1711 (for
2TU) and 1674 cm–1 (for 6m2TU), whereas in compounds 1 and 2, the values found are 1657 and 1651 cm–1. Furthermore, all compounds present bands of υC=N
of the bipy and 2TU/6m2TU ligands. Analyzing the region of the spectrum
in the range of 1400 to 1600 cm–1, it can be observed
that in all complexes, signals at 1433 and 1481 cm–1 are present, which can be attributed to υC=C stretching
vibrations. Compared with the precursor complex, it can be seen that
in the 1536 cm–1 region, there is a common band,
which refers to the υC=N stretching vibrations of the
bipy ligand. Thus, it can be noted that in complexes 1 and 2, there are bands that occur at 1570 cm–1 and these may correspond to the υC=N stretching vibration
of the thiouracil derivative ligands. The band at around 840 cm–1 due to the υP-F stretching vibration confirms
the presence of PF6– as a counterion.

In the present report, the molecular structures of complexes 1 and 2 were determined by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction (Figure 1 and Table S1). The main bond lengths
obtained for 1 and 2 (Table S2) reveal that the Ru–L bond values, around
the metal center, are similar in both complexes. This behavior is
expected given that the stereochemistry is the same as that of the
phosphorus atoms of the PPh3 ligand trans to each one.
The nitrogen atoms of the bipy, labeled as N2 and N4, are trans to
N3 and S2 atoms of thiouracil ligands, respectively. The X-ray diffraction
results show that 2TU and 6m2TU are coordinated by the nitrogen atom
N3 and sulfur, as bidentate. Mainly, in complex 2, the
coordination involving the N3 atom contribute to decreasing the steric
hindrance around the methyl group of position 6, in 6m2U. Interestingly,
both complexes present intramolecular interactions between the C–H
of the bipy ligand and the oxygen atom of the ligand 2-thiouracil
derivative [C–H(bipy)···O4]. This behavior is
important to stabilize the molecular structure of the complexes, allowing
the coordination to occur through the N3 atom. As can be seen in Figure 1, the coordination
involving the N1 atom and S2 atom will result in a steric hindrance
between the C–H(bipy) and the C–H of 2TU
or the −CH3 of 2TU, respectively.

Figure 1 Crystal structures of
complexes 1 and 2.

The different coordinations of the 2TU and 6m2TU ligands in 1 and 2, compared with those of the previously
reported complexes cis-[Ru(PPh3)2(TU)2],16 also contribute to
the different intermolecular interaction patterns related to the cis-[Ru(PPh3)2(TU)2] complexes.
In the cis-[Ru(PPh3)2(TU)2] complexes, there is a formation of a pattern of type R22(8) graph-set, forming dimeric bonds
N–H···O. On the other hand, the two crystal
structures reported here present the molecules forming intermolecular
interactions linking the molecules as a chain, C22(8) graph-set, involving the atoms N1–H···O4
(Figure 2).

Figure 2 H-bonds forming
an infinite N–H···O chain.

The structural aspects of complexes 1 and 2 may contribute to affecting their biological activity. In the CT-DNA
binding study, by UV absorption titration, it was found that the intrinsic
binding constant (Kb) values around 3.0–5.0
× 103 M–1. These results suggested
that complexes 1 and 2 interact weakly with
DNA, compared with others complexes with thiouracil derivatives, as
previously reported, which present more regions capable of carrying
out hydrogen bonds, showing Kb constants
at around 104 M–1.17 Furthermore, the Kb values
found are lower than those for complexes, which demonstrates the ability
to intercalate DNA.29,30

The cytotoxicity activities
of compounds 1 and 2 were investigated against
four cancer cells and one noncancer
cell population (Table 1). Even though the IC50 values are similar for both compounds,
complex 2 was more potent cytotoxic than complex 1. Both complexes showed IC50 values for cancer
cells comparable with the platinum metallodrug, oxaliplatin, and doxorubicin
(see Table 1). The
free ligands 2TU and 6m2TU were not cytotoxic at the concentrations
investigated.

As shown in Table 2, complexes 1 and 2 presented more selectivity
to HL-60 (3 times more cytotoxicity in relation to PBMC for complex 1 and 2.37 times more cytotoxicity in relation to PBMC for
complex 2) when compared with the other cancer cells

were used as positive controls.

Next, we examined light-scattering features, annexin V-FITC/PI
staining, and intracellular DNA content of HL-60 cells after incubation
with complexes 1 (1 and 2 μM) and 2 (0.5 and 1 μM) by flow cytometry. Both complexes caused cell
shrinkage, as observed by reduction in forward light scatter (FSC),
and nuclear condensation, as observed by increase in side scatter
(SCC), both morphological changes characteristic of apoptotic cells
(Figure 3). In addition,
augments in the percentage of early apoptotic cells was found in HL-60
cells treated with both complexes (P < 0.05) (Figure 4). Complex 1 induced early apoptotic cells in 40.5 and 49.8%, while 36.5
and 41.7% were found after the treatment with complex 2 at the lowest and highest concentrations, respectively. Doxorubicin
(1 μM) caused early apoptotic cells in 35.4% against 8.1% observed
in the negative control. Both complexes also caused a significant
internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells after 24 h incubation
(P < 0.05) (Figure 5). Complex 1 increased the DNA fragmentation
to 71.4 and 94.0% and complex 2 increased it to 47.2
and 67.9%, at lowest and highest concentrations, respectively. Doxorubicin
(1 μM) increased the DNA fragmentation up to 59.7%, and 18.6%
was observed for negative control cells. The cell cycle phases, G1/G0, S, and G2/M, were reduced proportionally.

Conclusions
In summary, two new
Ru(II) complexes [1 and 2] containing thiouracil
derivatives were synthetized and
studied against cancer cells. Complexes 1 and 2 are cationic, presenting the two triphenylphosphine ligands in the
trans configuration to each other, such as suggested by the 31P{1H} NMR experiments. The thiouracil ligand presents
the sulfur atom and N3 atom trans to N4 and N2 nitrogen of bipyridine,
respectively. The complex/DNA binding studied reveals the Kb of about 103 M–1, revealing a weak DNA interaction. The IC50 values against
cancer cells for complexes 1 and 2 are lower
than the IC50 values against noncancer cells that are desired.
The complex 2 with 6m2TU ligand showed a higher potency
than the complex 1 with 2TU ligand. Both Ru(II) compounds
caused DNA fragmentation, leading cell death by apoptosis. Complexes 1 and 2 also altered the cell cycle, reducing
the cells in G1/G0, S, and G2/M phases.

(Le) in the positive-ion mode, using methanol/acetonitrile as solvents
(LC/MS grade from Honeywell/B&J Brand). Conductivity values were
determined using 10–3 M solutions of the complexes
in CH2Cl2 employing a MeterLab CDM2300 instrument.
In addition, the IR spectra were obtained, in CsI, on a FT-IR Bomem-Michelson
102 spectrometer in the 4000–200 cm–1 region.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out using an electrochemical
analyzer BAS, model 100B at room temperature. For that, an CH2Cl2 solution containing 0.10 mol L–1 Bu4NClO4 (TBAP) as a supporting electrolyte
was employed and an one-compartment cell, with both working and auxiliary
electrodes as stationary Pt foils, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode,
0.10 M TBAP in CH2Cl2, was employed. Under these
conditions, the ferrocene (Fc) is oxidized at 0.43 V (Fc+/Fc). All
complexes were studied by NMR technique (1H, 31P{1H}, and 13C NMR). All spectra were obtained
on a Bruker DRX 400 MHz, using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal
reference and solvent DMSO-d6 to the two
compounds. The 31P{1H} chemical shifts were
reported based on H3PO4 85% reference. All of
the spectra obtained here are represented in the Supporting Information
(Figures S1–S25). The UV–vis
spectra of complexes 1 and 2 were obtained
on a Hewlett Packard diode array 8452A, using CH2Cl2 as a solvent. All single crystals of the Ru(II)-thiouracil-based
complexes (1 and 2) were obtained at room
temperature by the solvent diffusion method. We have used the diffusion
of diethyl ether to a complex solution (CH2Cl2/CH3OH). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments
for both complexes were carried out at room temperature on an Enraf–Nonius
Kappa-CCD diffractometer using the Mo Kα radiation (λ
= 0.71073 Å) monochromated by graphite. The crystal structures
of 1 and 2 were solved by the direct method
and refined using the SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 programs, respectively.
Absorption corrections were carried out using the Gaussian method.
All nonhydrogen atoms of complexes 1 and 2 were located and refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. The
C–H aromatic hydrogen atoms were added with C–H distance
fixed at 0.93 Å and refined with fixed displacement parameters
[Uiso(H) = 1.2 Ueq(Csp2)]. In complex 2, the H-atoms
of the methyl group were set as isotropic with the C–H distance
of 0.96 Å and Uiso(H) = 1.5 Ueq(Csp3).

For structure representations,
the MERCURY 4.0 program was used. In addition, we have used the CrystalExplorer
program to access the Hirshfeld surfaces, allowing us to obtain the
fingerprint plots for complexes 1 and 2.

CT-DNA Binding Experiments
Spectroscopic Titrations
To study
the DNA interaction
by spectroscopic titrations, we have used a DNA solution prepared
in a Tris–HCl buffer at pH = 7.2 [0.5 mM Tris-base, 5 mM Tris–HCl,
50 mM NaCl]. The ration of UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm indicated
that the CT-DNA solution is protein-free. Thus, the concentration
of CT-DNA was determined using the absorption intensity at 260 nm
and the molar absorption coefficient value of 6600 M–1 cm–1. The ruthenium complexes 1 and 2 were solubilized in a Tris–HCl buffer containing
DMSO at 5%. The UV–vis titration experiments were performed
keeping the concentration of ruthenium complex fixed at 25 μM
and increasing the concentrations of the CT-DNA. A sample correction
was made for the absorbance of DNA and the spectra were recorded after
solution equilibration for 2 min. The intrinsic equilibrium binding
constant (Kb) of the complexes to CT-DNA
was obtained using the expression of Wolfe and co-workers.31 Alterations in the absorption intensity with
the increasing concentration of CT-DNA was monitored and analyzed
by regression analysis.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assay
HL-60
(human promyelocytic
leukemia), K-562 (human chronic myelocytic leukemia), HepG2 (human
hepatocellular carcinoma), and B16-F10 (mouse melanoma) cell lines
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA) and cultured following the instructions of ATCC animal cell culture
guide. All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma by Lookout Mycoplasma
qPCR detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and were mycoplasma free. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll density gradient
in GE Ficoll-Paque Plus from heparinized blood collected from 20-
to 35-year-old, nonsmoker healthy donors after obtaining an informed
consent. PBMCs were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium plus 20% fetal bovine
serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 50 μg/mL gentamycin at 37 °C
with 5% CO2. ConA (10 μg/mL) was added at the beginning
of the culture and treated with complexes 1 and 2 after 24 h incubation. Research Ethics Committee from the
Fiocruz-BA approved the experimental protocol (number 031019/2013).

Cell viability was measured by alamar blue method, as previously
described.32 Cells were plated into 96-well
plates (0.7 × 105 cells/mL for adherent cells or 0.3
× 106 cells/mL for cells suspended in 100 μL
of medium). After 24 h, complexes 1 and 2 were dissolved in DMSO to form a solution of 0.19–25.0 μg/mL.
Then, the sample compounds were added to each well and kept incubated
for a period of 72 h. Oxaliplatin (OXA) and DOX, doxorubicin hydrochloride,
from Laboratory IMA S.A.I.C were used as positive controls. Four hours
(for cell lines) or 24 h (for PBMC) before the end of incubation,
20 μL of a stock solution (0.312 mg/mL) of alamar blue (resazurin;
from Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well. Absorbance was measured
using a SpectraMax 190 multiplate reader at 570 and 600 nm.

Flow
Cytometric Assays
FITC Annexin V apoptosis detection
kit I (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was used for apoptosis quantification,
and the analysis was performed according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Cell fluorescence and light scattering features were
measured by flow cytometry. Percentages of viable (annexin V-FITC/PI
double negative cells), early apoptotic (annexin V-FITC positive,
but PI negative cells), late apoptotic (annexin V-FITC/PI double positive
cells), and necrotic (PI positive, but annexin V-FITC negative cells)
cells were quantified.

Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and
cell cycle distribution were analyzed by the quantification of DNA
content.33 Cells were harvested in a permeabilization
solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 μg/mL propidium iodide
(PI), 0.1% sodium citrate, and 100 μg/mL RNAse (all from Sigma-Aldrich
Co.) and incubated in dark for 15 min at room temperature. Cell fluorescence
was determined by flow cytometry. In this assay, all DNA sub-diploid
in size (sub-G1/G0) was considered internucleosomal
DNA fragmentation, and G1/G0, S, and G2/M phases were quantified.

For all flow cytometry analyses,
10 000 events were recorded
per sample using a BD LSRFortessa cytometer, BD FACSDiva software
(BD Biosciences), and FlowJo software 10 (FlowJo Lcc; Ashland, OR).
Cellular debris were omitted from the analysis.

Statistical
Analysis
Data are presented as mean ±
S.E.M. or IC50 values [half-maximal inhibitory concentration],
and their 95% confidence intervals calculated by nonlinear regression
from three independent experiments evaluated in duplicate. Statistical
analysis was carried out using the Intuitive Software for Science
GRAPHPAD.
