A novel ultrasensitive and simple
amplified immunosensing strategy
is designed based on a surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) nanohybrid
made from covalently conjugated thionine–gold nanoparticles
(GNP–Th), as a novel amplified fluorescence label, and magnetic
nanoparticles (MNPs), as a biological carrier, used for hepatitis
B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) detection. This immunosensing strategy
operates on the basis of the capture and then release of the amplified
fluorescence label. Capturing of the antiHBs-antibody (Ab)-modified
GNP–thionine hybrid (GNP–Th-Ab) is carried out through
the formation of a two-dimensional (sandwich) probe between this amplified
label and antiHBs-antibody-modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNP-Ab),
in the presence of a target antigen and using an external magnetic
force. Afterward, releasing of the captured fluorescence label is
performed using a protease enzyme (pepsin) by a digestion mechanism
of grafted antibodies on the GNP–thionine hybrid. As a result
of antibody digestion, the amplified fluorescent hybrids (labels)
are released into the solution. To understand the mechanism of enhanced
fluorescence, the nature of the interaction between thionine and gold
nanoparticles is studied using the B3LYP density functional method.
In such a methodology, several new mechanisms and structures are used
simultaneously, including a SEF-based metal nanoparticle–organic
dye hybrid, dual signal amplification in a two-dimensional probe between
the GNP–thionine hybrid and MNPs, and a novel releasing method
using protease enzymes. These factors improve the sensitivity and
speed, along with the simplicity of the procedure. Under optimal conditions,
the fluorescence signal increases with the increment of HBs antigen
concentration in the linear dynamic range of 4.6 × 10–9 to 0.012 ng/mL with a detection limit (LOD) of 4.6 × 10–9 ng/mL. The proposed immunosensor has great potential
in developing ultrasensitive and rapid diagnostic platforms.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important global public
health problem, with significant morbidity and mortality. Even with
universal vaccination programs, it has been impossible to significantly
prevent acute cases of HBV infection, especially in high-risk populations.
Approximately 240 million people are chronic HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)
carriers.1,2 Therefore, by developing early diagnostic
methods using these proteins, serious injuries can be prevented. Up
to now, different methods have been reported for HBV detection, including
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real-time PCR, electrochemical
assay, chemiluminescence assay, fluorescence immunoassay, etc.3−12 But these methods often have some limitations, such as complex processes
and equipment and longtime analysis. Therefore, the development of
simple, fast, and sensitive sensors can be very advantageous. Up to
now, due to their simplicity and stability, antibody–antigen
interactions have created a long history in the development of immunosensors,
and they have been used in various methods, such as fluorescence immunoassay,
colorimetric immunoassay, electrochemical immunoassay, electrochemiluminescence-based
immunoassay, SPR-based immunoassay, etc.13−15 To develop
more desirable sensors/biosensors, in terms of sensitivity and cost,
a basic knowledge of different aspects of science, such as chemistry,
biology, nanoscience, and physics, is needed. Up to now, sandwich
and competitive assays are the two main strategies used in immunosensors,
and among them, the sandwich format is more conventional. In this
report, a novel strategy has been put forward based on the sandwich
format. This immunosensing strategy operates on the basis of capturing
and then releasing of an amplified label. Capturing is carried out
through the formation of a magnetic nanoparticle-antibody (MNP-Ab)
and an antibody-fluorescence label (Ab-Label) in the presence of a
target antigen to form an MNP-Ab-Ag-Ab-Label, using an external magnetic
force. Then the releasing was performed using a protease enzyme (pepsin)
by a digestion mechanism of grafted antibodies on the complex. As
a result of antibody digestion, amplified fluorescent hybrids are
released into the solution. Due to their biocompatibility, ease of
functionalization, and paramagnetic nature, magnetic nanoparticles
have become an effective part of the most recent reported drug delivery
systems, separation systems, and biological applications. Combination
of magnetic NPs with a signal generator site using different biological
molecules, such as DNA, aptamers, and antibodies, is one of the interesting
applications of MNPs.16,17

Proteases are enzymes that
catalyze the hydrolysis of the peptide
and isopeptide bonds that join amino acids within proteins (known
as proteolysis). In the past decade, the digestion of antibodies by
proteolytic enzymes (proteases) has been used to study their structure.
Many diverse structures can be obtained by fragmentation of the different
classes of antibodies with different enzymes, or by using the same
enzyme and changing the conditions.18−20 Pepsin is of particular
interest as it was the first enzyme to be discovered. It is routinely
used for the generation of F(ab)2 fragments from immunoglobulin
G (IgG) and also has the ability to cleave the heavy chains near the
hinge region. One or more of the disulfide bonds that join the heavy
chains in the hinge region are preserved, so the two Fab regions of
the antibody remain joined together, yielding a divalent molecule
(containing two antibody binding sites), and hence the light chains
remain intact and attached to the heavy chain, whereas the Fc fragment
is digested into small peptides.21,22 Common applications
of these enzymes are in digestion of antibodies to characterize and
analyze their components, preparation of collagen for cosmeceutical
purposes, assessment of digestibility of proteins in food chemistry,
and subculture of viable mammary epithelial cells.23−28 To date, there has been no report on the use of proteolytic enzymes
for captured label release in analytical applications.

On the
other hand, ultrasensitive detection in analytical methods
requires signal amplification strategies. Common amplification strategies
in modernized optical detection methods include the combination of
biological molecules, such as antibodies, aptamers, and DNA, with
magnetic nanoparticles, quantum dots, etc.29,30 But the pathway toward simplicity and higher detection ability needs
more attention to the practical aspect. In this area, the use of extraordinary
features of plasmonic materials, to create new sensors and biosensors,
has attracted the attention of researchers. By utilizing local surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR), plasmonic nanostructures have already been
developed as signal amplifiers for optical sensors.31−33 The fundamental
of surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF)-based methods is the coupling
of the absorption and emission frequency of a fluorophore with the
resonance frequency of a plasmonic material.34 In fact, the plasmonic material acts as an optical antenna. Under
appropriate conditions, the fluorescence emission of a fluorescent
molecule is strengthened by its placement next to the plasmonic material.
In the past decade, gold nanoparticles (GNP) with variable radiant
properties, such as absorption, scattering, and surface plasmon resonance,
have been brought to the forefront of designed sensors/biosensors.
Among the various metals that possess the plasmonic property, gold
and silver are more active in the VIS and NIR fields. But silver has
lower chemical stability and is easily oxidized. These features make
gold the perfect option for building SPR-based systems.35−37 In the designing of a SEF sensor, principles which have to be considered
are the plasmon reinforced field, the spectral overlapping between
metal plasmon absorption and fluorophore emission, and the metal nanostructure–fluorophore
distance.38,39 In this work, the proposed fluorophore is
thionine. Thionine (3,7-diamino-5-phenothiazinium), a tricyclic heteroaromatic
molecule, is one of the most important members of phenothiazine dyes.
It has been widely used as a photosensitizer of large-band gap semiconductors,
in the study of electron transfer with DNA, in photoinduced inactivation
of viruses, in impedance-based biosensors, etc.40−42 But there are
limited numbers of reports on the use of thionine in optical sensors,
especially fluorescence, and most of them are related to fluorescence
quenching of thionine in the presence of plasmonic metal nanoparticles.43,44 In fact, optical characteristics of a GNP and thionine hybrid drastically
change with changing NP size and distance between them, and this dependency
allows the possibility of further investigation and development of
metal–dye nanohybrids.45 Theoretical
studies based on quantum mechanics have a great role in the understanding
and investigations of conjugated organic molecules to metal nanostructures.
Density functional theory (DFT) and the combination of different methods
such as time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) are used as the most useful theoretical
tool in modern empirical sciences, which are at the head of applied
research.46−48 In a part of this work, a theoretical study of the
gold cluster and its influence on the spectroscopic properties of
thionine was conducted, and the first-principles method based on density
functional theory (DFT) was used to determine the details of the interaction
between gold nanoparticles and thionine. On the basis of all above-mentioned
facts and taking into account the need for simple and fast methods,
the advantages of SEF, using a covalent hybrid of GNP–thionine,
and the advantages of magnetic nanoparticles as biological carriers,
to create an ultrasensitive two-dimensional biosensor for hepatitis
B virus surface antigen, were used. So we designed a capture–release
sandwich-type immunosensor using an anti-HBV-antibody-modified GNP–thionine
covalent hybrid (SEF-based nanohybrid) (GNP–Th-Ab) to enhance
the signal and anti-HBV-antibody-modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNP-Ab)
as biological carriers. Magnetic nanoparticles provide the possibility
of collecting the resulting sandwich probes in an easy and fast manner.
The greater the amount of analyte, the greater the number of GNP–Th-Ab
collected with MNPs. In the next step, for the first time in biosensor
mode, releasing of captured signaling sites occurs through digestion
of antibodies grafted on the nanohybrids by pepsin. The designed immunoassay
has high sensitivity and selectivity for HBs virus antigen. Using
this methodology, in the presence of trace amounts of the analyte,
very high dual signal amplification is obtained. A comparison of the
results of this proposed strategy with those of recently reported
biosensors for HBs antigen detection demonstrates the higher sensitivity
of our design.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded to investigate the surface modifications
of magnetic nanoparticles and covalent modification of gold nanoparticles
in the GNP–Th covalent hybrid. Figure 1A shows the FTIR spectra of bare Fe3O4 MNP (a) and Fe3O4-3-aminopropyl
triethoxysilane (APTES) MNP (b). The observed band at 583 cm–1 is attributed to the presence of Fe–O stretching vibrations.
The silane polymer modification on the surface of magnetite nanoparticles
was confirmed by bands at 808 and 1078 cm–1, which
are related to the Si–OH and Si–O–Si groups.
Also, the bands at 2922 and 2854 cm–1 in the Fe3O4-APTES MNP spectrum are attributed to the stretching
vibration of the C–H bond of the propylamine group, which proves
APTES functionalization of MNP. The broad band at 3300–3500
cm–1 is due to −OH stretching vibrations.
On the other hand, two broad bands, which appeared at 1635 and 3417
cm–1, are attributed to the N–H stretching
vibrations and bending mode of a free −NH2 group,
as a result of amine grafting on MNPs. These results indicate that
MNPs are successfully functionalized by SiO2 and APTES.49,50 Covalently, surface modification of gold nanoparticles with thionine
was proved by FTIR spectroscopy. Figure 1B shows the IR spectra of free thionine (a)
and a covalent hybrid of GNP–thionine (b). The absorption bands
at 1604 and 1634 cm–1 in figure (a) are ascribed
to N–H bending vibrations, and the bands at 1500 and 1349 cm–1 are related to the skeletal vibration of the phenyl
ring of thionine. The bands at 2732 and 2937 cm–1 are related to N–H stretching vibrations. These peaks are
also seen in the case of the GNP–thionine hybrid, which indicates
the proper thionine attachment on gold nanoparticles. The absorption
bands at 2827 and 2921 cm–1 are related to citrate
impurity in the sample. The absorption bands at 3139 and 3360 cm–1 are related to the N–H stretching vibration
of the amino groups, which confirms the proper covalent attachment
of thionine on gold nanoparticles. The band at 940 cm–1 can be attributed to the C–S bending vibrations of the heteroaromatic
ring of thionine, and the band at 856 cm–1 is due
to the N–H bending vibration of amino groups, which are very
clear in the IR spectra of the GNP–thionine hybrid, confirming
the covalent attachment, which indicates the presence of N–H
bonds in the vicinity of the gold nanoparticle surface. Due to the
electron deficiency of nitrogen and sulfur atoms in the central ring,
they tend to have lower binding to the nanoparticles’ surfaces.
On the basis of the above fact, it can be concluded that there are
free amino groups near the GNP surface, indicating the formation of
the covalent GNP–thionine hybrid.51,52 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to further characterize
the prepared nanostructures. The field emission scanning electron
microscope (FE-SEM) image of the synthesized Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles showed a relatively spherical and uniform
morphology with an average diameter of about 30–40 nm, Figure 2A. The SEM image
of gold nanoparticles shows a spherical morphology with an average
diameter of about 10–15 nm Figure 2B. Finally, the SEM image of the prepared
sandwich probe (GNP–Th-Ab-Ag-Ab-MNP) obviously indicates the
accumulation of a large number of GNP–Th hybrids around the
magnetic nanoparticles, Figure 2C.

2.2 Effect
of Physical Adsorption and Covalent
Binding of Thionine on SEF
On the basis of the credibility
of simulation studies, chemical attachment of thionine onto the GNP
enhances the fluorescence intensity. To provide evidence and evaluate
the performance of this theoretical prediction, two methods, physical
adsorption and covalent attachment, were tested for thionine and gold
nanoparticle attachment. Figure 3 shows the excitation and emission spectra of free
thionine (a), a covalent hybrid of GNP–Th (b), and adsorbed
thionine on GNPs (c). The peak at 520 nm is the spectral property
of gold nanoparticles with 15–20 nm diameter. The thionine
spectrum in water consists of two absorption bands at 598 and 565
nm, which are related to the absorption property of the monomeric
and dimeric forms of a thionine molecule, respectively.53,54 The peak at 565 nm, which is related to the dimeric form, is decreased
and that of the monomeric form (598 nm) is pronounced in the covalent
GNP–Th hybrid spectrum (c). In the noncovalent binding form,
due to the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged
GNPs and the positively charged thionine molecules, spatial saturation
of the dye on the nanoparticle increases, and the tendency for dipole–dipole
interactions between thionine molecules becomes greater, which results
in the formation of the dimeric form of thionine molecules, and this
leads to a reduction in thionine fluorescence emission.

covalent hybrid, and (c) adsorbed Th on GNPs.

2.3 Computational Molecular Model
To
simulate the adsorption of thionine and its covalent binding through
an anchoring group on the gold nanoparticle surface, full geometry
optimizations were performed using the B3LYP functional, the standard
6–31 G(d,p) basis set for light atoms, and the LanL2DZ basis
set for gold atoms to obtain the ground-state geometry (see Figure 4A). The optimization
and single-point energy calculations were performed using the polarized
continuum model46 implemented in the Gaussian
98 program.47 The charge-transfer lengths
and the charge difference densities were calculated using the Multiwfn
program.48 The orbital transition contributions
were obtained using the GAUSSSUM 2.2 program.55 To investigate the effect of the anchoring group on the radiative
behavior of thionine, the eighteenth lowest excited states of the
optimized structures were calculated, and the related parameters are
gathered in Table 1. It is well known that fluorescence performance of a structure depends
on the distribution of electrons and holes in its excited states.56−59 As a measure of electron–hole (e–h) distribution,
the charge-transfer length (Δr) is introduced.58 The electronic state transition is considered
in the charge transfer if Δr ≥ 2 Å.56 The values in Table 1 show that the fourth excited state of covalently
attached thionine exceeds this criterion considerably. The charge
difference density plots of electronic transitions are shown in Figure 4B,C, which reveal
the local excitation of electrons and holes for all excited states
except for S4 in covalently attached thionine. The enhancement of
fluorescence activity of covalently attached thionine can be attributed
to the direct recombination of an excited e–h pair in this
state. In noncovalently attached thionine, the degree of electron
transfer from holes is weak, which can be considered as a main factor
for the lack of fluorescence activity. To clarify the role of the
anchoring group in fluorescence activity, a plot of contributing molecular
orbitals in transition states is depicted in Figure 5A,B. As can be seen, the HOMO – 3
is mainly concentrated on the anchoring group, whereas the LUMO mainly
concentrates on the dye moiety, which provides a long-range charge
transfer for the system. In contrast, the symmetrical population of
molecular orbitals for the noncovalent system inhibits a long separation
of hole–electron pairs.

2.4 Optimization of Measurement Conditions
To obtain this reinforced fluorescence, various parameters need to
be optimized due to its significant role in sensing efficiency. The
effect of the gold nanoparticle to thionine ratio on fluorescence
emission was investigated by experiments carried out using different
amounts of thionine in the presence of a constant concentration of
gold nanoparticles. Briefly, 500 μL aliquots of prepared amine-terminated
modified GNPs were combined with different volumes of thionine solution
in phosphate buffer (4.6 mM, pH 7.4) and stirred for 12 h at room
temperature. Afterward, all samples were washed with cooled phosphate
buffer and used in the construction of GNP–Th-Ab-Ag-Ab-MNP.
The results (Figure 6A) indicate that the optimum GNP/thionine volume ratio was 5/2 (optimized
thionine concentration 1.3 mM). The incubation time required for the
antibody–antigen interaction was investigated for probe formation.
Briefly, 500 μL of prepared GNP–Th-Ab and 500 μL
of prepared MNP-Ab were mixed with equal volumes of antigen solution
(1.65 × 10–7 ng/mL) in 1 mL microtubes. The
prepared probes were washed and used in the sensing method. As can
be seen in Figure 6B, the optimum incubation time is 2 h. In acidic media (pH ∼
5), the IgG hydrolyzed to (Fab’)2 and was digested
to small fragments of Fc by the pepsin enzyme.21,22 The received signal during the release process is affected by the
pepsin concentration. Therefore, a series of experiments were conducted
to investigate the effect of pepsin concentration on the immunosensor
response. First, the optimum time for degradation of the antibody
by pepsin was evaluated. For this purpose, a 1 mL portion of the prepared
probe under optimal conditions was washed and exposed to pepsin solution
(0.001 g/mL) for different times, and finally, the fluorescence emission
of released GNP–Th was measured. Based on the recorded results
(Figure 6C), 8 min
was chosen as the optimum time for antibody fragmentation by pepsin.
In the next step, 1 mL portions of the prepared probe under the optimal
conditions (antigen concentration was 1.6 × 10–7 ng/mL) were washed and exposed to different concentrations of pepsin
(pH ∼ 5). The recorded fluorescence intensity for different
pepsin concentrations under the optimum conditions is depicted in Figure 6D. As can be seen,
the maximum signal is achieved when the pepsin concentration is 0.001
g/mL. Thionine has a neutral form at pH 10, a monomeric form at pH
values 2–9, and an H-type dimer form (deprotonated form) at
pH values less than 2.53,54

by pepsin. (D) Pepsin concentration effect. (E) pH effect on (a) free
Th and (b) GNP–Th-Ab. (F) HBV-antibody (Ab) concentration effect.

Therefore,.pH has a variety of effects on the spectral
properties
of thionine and GNP–Th. For example, the pH affects the probe
formation, fluorescence intensity, digestion activity of pepsin, and
undesired adsorption of probe components. In the next step, the pH
effect on the probe formation was evaluated. The obtained spectra
show that the recorded fluorescence intensity in the pH range of 2–9
is almost constant, and the fluorescence intensity goes down for solution
pH values lower than 2 or greater than 9. In aqueous medium, water
and thionine undergo a hydrogen bond in the ground state. The reduction
in the severity of emission at pH values lower than 2 or greater than
9 should be related to the interactions with negatively charged species,
such as OH– and Cl–. This effect
is known as the solvent effect and is described by the Lippert equation.53,54 As predicted by simulation and theoretical studies (section 2),
the recorded results indicate that the fluorescence of SEF-based GNT-Th
(b) is higher than the fluorescence of free thionine (a) in a wide
range of pH values, even in higher thionine concentrations, Figure 6E. Finally, as a
considerably effective factor, the concentration of HBV-Ab for the
produced signal was optimized. Based on recorded fluorescence emission
for a fixed concentration of antigen (3.2 × 10–6 ng/mL) and various concentrations of HBV-Ab, 2.5 μg/mL was
chosen as the optimum concentration (Figure 6F).

2.5 Fluorescence Signal Amplification
in SEF-Based
Immunosensors
To develop immunosensors with ease of preparation
and operation, lower cost, and higher sensitivity, a different strategy
could be very beneficial. In our proposed method, HBsAg is measured
on the basis of the formation of a sandwich immunosensor, using GNP–Th-Ab,
HBs antigen (Ag), and MNP-Ab. GNP–Th-Ab acts as the fluorescence
signal generator and amplifier site, and MNP-Ab acts as the probe
collector site. Actually, for each antigen molecule, a ball of GNP–Th
with amplified fluorescence on the basis of surface plasmon resonance
is collected with MNPs. Ultimately, the boosted fluorescence signal
is associated with HBsAg concentration. As mentioned, after collecting,
washing, and exposing the probe to the acidic solution of pepsin,
the GNP–Th hybrid was released into the solution. Then, by
measuring the fluorescence of the solution under the optimum conditions,
the concentration of HBsAg was measured. The performance of the proposed
method was evaluated through the signal competition between control
and measuring experiments. The measuring experiment was run by mixing
GNP–Th-Ab, HBsAg, and MNP-Ab, and the control experiments were
performed by mixing HBsAg, Ab-free GNP–Th, and Ab-free MNP.
As depicted in Figure 7, a large difference in fluorescence intensity is observed between
the control experiment (a) and the measuring one (b).

experiment and (b) control experiment.

2.6 Analytical Performance of SEF-Based Immunoassay
toward HBsAg
The analytical performance of the proposed immunosensor
for HBsAg detection at various concentrations and optimum conditions
was evaluated. Figure 6 shows the recorded typical fluorescence of the immunosensor in the
presence of different concentrations of HBsAg. Figure 8A shows the immunosensor response (a) and
its related calibration diagram (b) in the range from 6.14 ×
10–9(1) to 0.012(10) ng/mL, and Figure 8B shows the immunosensor response
(a) and its related calibration diagram (b) in the range from 4.6
× 10–9(1) to 1.2 × 10–6(9) ng/mL.

Figure 8 (A) Flourescence response of the proposed immunosensor in different
concentrations of HBsAg at an excitation wavelength of 560 nm: (a)

× 10–5, (7) 9.6 × 10–5, (8) 4.8 × 10–4, (9) 2.4 × 10–3, (10) 0.012 ng/mL; (b) (1) 4.6 × 10–9, (2)

As can be seen, the fluorescence signal increases gradually
with
HBsAg concentration, and there is a linear relationship between the
fluorescence signals. The concentration of HBsAg in the dynamic range
can be obtained from 4.6 × 10–9 to 0.012 (ng/mL).
The regression equation can be written as y = 62.672 ln x + 1212.4
(R2 = 0.994, n = 10) and the detection limit can be estimated
to be 4.6 × 10–9 ng/mL. The results suggest
that the efficacy of the proposed method for ultrasensitive detection
of HBsAg is associated with the capture–release technique and
enhanced fluorescence, using the GNP–Th covalent hybrid. Therefore,
the present techniques provide the possibility of high signal amplification
and, consequently, the possibility for further improvements in sensitivity.
In addition, compared with the methods in recent reports on HBsAg
measurements (Table 2), the developed method exhibits better efficiency and higher sensitivity
with a lower detection limit.

2.7 Reproducibility of the
Immunosensor
The reproducibility of the proposed immunosensor
was examined by
using eight probes, which were prepared separately and used to measure
the HBsAg in PBS (pH = 7.4) (Figure 9). The relative standard deviation value was 6.5%,
which suggests that the reproducibility of the present immunosensor
for the detection of HBsAg is acceptable.

proposed immunosensor.

2.8 Real
Sample Analysis
To evaluate
to what extent the proposed immunosensor could be applicable and to
validate and, of course, to get proof of the ability of the strategy,
the standard addition method was used by spiking the target HBsAg
into a diluted human serum sample (Table 3). An acceptable recovery and relative standard
deviation could be observed. The obtained results indicate that the
designed methodology in this study has good potential to be employed
as a platform to detect HBsAg in real serum samples.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
a novel magnetoimmunoassay is developed for determination
of HBsAg. The suggested method includes a capture–release mechanism,
and also a new fluorescence label (GNP–Th), which amplifies
its fluorescence intensity based on the plasmonic effect of gold nanoparticles.
Our proposed immunosensor contains a collector site (MNP-Ab), which
collects the fluorescence label (GNP–Th) after the formation
of a sandwich probe in the presence of HBsAg. Also, for the first
time, a proteolytic enzyme is used to release GNP–Th into the
solution. As the results show, the recorded fluorescence signal intensity
is related to the HBsAg concentration. The immunosensor efficiency
is improved using a GNP–Th covalent hybrid under controlled
conditions combined with magnetic nanoparticles as biological carriers.
Theoretical calculations are used to study the effect of covalent
and noncovalent binding modes and their effect on surface plasmon
reinforcement. The designed immunosensor has practical benefits, such
as simplicity, low cost, a wide dynamic linear range, selectivity,
and high sensitivity. The proposed immunoassay has a high ability
for HBsAg measurements in the linear dynamic range of 4.6 × 10–9–0.012 ng/mL and with a detection limit of
4.6 × 10–9 ng/mL. In conclusion, this immunosensor
can be a powerful tool to detect and measure other diagnostic biomarkers.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and General Techniques
Primary antihuman hepatitis B antibody (HBV-Ab) and HBsAg were
purchased
from Dia.Pro Diagnostic Bioprobes srl. Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS),
sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ethanol, glutaraldehyde, ferric chloride,
ferrous chloride, ammonium hydroxide (25%), toluene, tetrachloroauric
acid (HAuCl4), sodium citrate, cystamine, and all other
reagents of analytical grade were from Merck, Sigma, or Aldrich. The
phosphate buffer solution was used for all measurements. Experiments
were carried out at room temperature, 25 ± 0.1 °C.

4.2 Apparatus and Procedures
All fluorescence
experiments were carried out using an LS-55 Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer
driven with Twin lab software. The morphology and dimensions of the
nanoparticles were examined using a field emission scanning electron
microscope (FE-SEM). To confirm the nanoparticle phase, the nature
of the coating, and its bonding on the surface, Fourier transform
infrared spectra (FTIR) were recorded between 4000 and 400 cm–1.

4.3 Preparation of GNP–Th
and GNP–Th-Ab
The Turkevich method with some modifications
was used to synthesize
the gold nanoparticles.60 Briefly, Haucl4·3H2O (0.0078 g) was dissolved in 20 mL of
distilled water to obtain a 1 mM solution. This solution was transferred
to 50 mL Erlenmeyer and then stirred until boiling point. When the
solution reached the boiling point, 2 mL of preheated sodium citrate
solution (1%) was added all at once. The color of the solution then
slowly turned gray and then red wine color. This color change took
about 10 min. After reaching ambient temperature, the synthesized
GNPs were kept at 4 °C. To prepare covalently attached thionine
on the surface of gold nanoparticles, first, the amine substrate was
provided by cystamine; 200 mL of cystamine solution (0.0003 M) in
phosphate buffer (7.4) was added to the synthesized GNPs (20 mL),
and after 1 h, 1 mL of glutaraldehyde solution was added and stirred
for 5 min; after incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, 2 mL of thionine
solution (1.3 mM) in phosphate buffer (7.4) was added and stirred
for 24 h at room temperature. Then, the resulting hybrid was washed
several times with cooled phosphate buffer (7.4) and centrifuged to
remove the unreacted components. Physical adsorption of thionine on
the GNP surface was performed using the following steps: 2 mL of thionine
solution in phosphate buffer (4.6 mM) (7.4) was added to 20 mL of
prepared GNPs, and then stirred for 12 h using a magnetic stirrer.
Afterward, the resulting mixture was centrifuged and washed with cold
phosphate buffer to remove the unadsorbed thionine. These two procedures
are shown in Figure 10a,b, respectively. The HBV-Ab modified hybrids were prepared using
the following procedure: 10 mL of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, 7.4) was
added to the resulting washed hybrids followed by addition of 200
μL of glutaraldehyde solution and 150 μL of antibody solution,
and this mixture was incubated for 24 h at 4 °C. After this incubation
time, the resulting particles were washed with phosphate buffer to
remove unreacted components and kept at 4 °C.

covalent and noncovalent attachment of thionine
on GNP: (a) preparation steps on the GNP–Th covalent hybrid
and (b) preparation steps on noncovalently attached GNP–Th.

4.4 Synthesis of MNP-Ab
First, MNPs were
synthesized in an alkaline solution of ferric chloride and ferrous
chloride via the standard coprecipitation method reported by Liu with
some modifications.61 Briefly, FeCl3. 6H2O (2.7 g) and FeCl2. 4H2O (1.39 g) were dissolved in 100 mL of deoxygenated distilled water
at 80̊C under N2 protection and vigorous mechanical
stirring, and then 7.5 mL of ammonium hydroxide were added dropwise.
The reaction mixture was stirred for 60 min and then cooled to room
temperature. Then, the resulting black precipitate was collected using
an external magnet, washed four times with water, and then dried at
room temperature for 48 h. Subsequently, core/shell Fe3O4@silica was prepared according to the Stöber
method with some modifications.62 Typically,
1 g of the as-synthesized MNPs were dispersed in a mixture of 100
mL of ethanol and 20 mL of distilled water and sonicated for 30 min.
Then, 5 mL of 25% ammonia aqueous solution was added with vigorous
stirring followed by dropwise addition of 2 mL of TEOS to this solution,
and the reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h under N2 protection.
The resulting particles were collected with a magnet, washed several
times with ethanol and water, and then dried at room temperature.
To prepare amine-functionalized MNPs (MNP-APTES), the obtained powder
(1 g) was dispersed in methanol (100 mL) and toluene (30 mL) and sonicated
for 30 min, followed by dropwise addition of APTES (99%,1 mL), and
the reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h and separated using a magnet,
redispersed in ethanol, washed several times, and then dried at room
temperature under vacuum. Finally, preparation of MNP-Ab was followed
by dispersing 0.005 g of as prepared MNP-APTES in 2 mL of phosphate
buffer for 15 min, and then, 50 μL of glutaraldehyde solution
and 50 μL of antibody solution were added to this suspension
and kept at 4̊C for 24 h. Afterward, the resulting MNP-Abs were
washed to remove unreacted components, and then 2 mL of phosphate
buffer (7.4, 0.1 M) was added to them and kept at 4° C.

4.5 Immunoassay Procedure and HBsAg Measurement
The prepared
and washed probe components (MNP-Ab and GNP–Th-Ab)
in phosphate buffer (7.4), according to the above instructions, were
used as immunosensing materials. Briefly, 100 μL portions of
the prepared GNP–Th-Ab and 100 μL portions of MNP-Ab
were mixed into 1 mL microtubes. Subsequently, different concentrations
of HBsAg solution (pH = 7.4) were added into the microtubes containing
the MNP-Ab and GNP–Th-Ab mixture in PBS. The tubes were shaken
during the incubation time. After 2 h, the obtained sandwich complex
was collected easily by an external magnet and washed with phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1 M). Then 500 μL of pepsin solution (0.0005
g/mL) in acetic acid (pH 4.7) was added. As a result, antibodies were
digested and the GNP–Th hybrid was released into the solution.
After a short time (8 min), the fluorescence of the solution was measured
(Ex: 560 nm). All measurements were carried
out at room temperature (Scheme 1).
