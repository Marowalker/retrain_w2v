Polo-like-kinase 1 (PLK1), which
is a serine–threonine protein
kinase overexpressed in cancer cells, is known to regulate tumor growth
and have recently gathered attention as a target gene for RNA interference
because of the poor bioavailability and nonspecificity of the available
inhibitors. However, the lower transfection efficiency of siRNA and
its poor stability in biological mileu necessitate the need of efficient
siRNA delivery systems. Here, we report efficacious polymeric nanoparticles
for the delivery of PLK1 siRNA in mammalian cancer cells. N-Isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) and N-isopropylmethacrylamide-co-NIPAm nanogels were synthesized and modified using poly-ε-lysine.
Furthermore, their ability to induce gene silencing was investigated
by flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the
silencing efficiency observed was related to the polymer composition
and its effect on the gene loading and protection ability and the
endosomal escape capability. This study attempts to leverage the understanding
of the cell–material interaction, thus, addressing the bottlenecks
of siRNA delivery for enhancing the efficacy of the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-based delivery vehicle.

Introduction
Polo-like-kinase 1, (PLK1) has been identified
as one of the key regulators of mitosis.1−3 Its overexpression is
correlated with aggressive behavior4 in
a number of cancer types, making it a potential target for cancer
treatment. It is also involved in mechanisms inducing resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, paclitaxel, metformin,
and gemcitabine.5 A number of small-molecule
inhibitors of PLK1 are in clinical trials, however, poor bioavailability
and off-target effects6,7 limit their efficiency. Thus,
a more specific RNA interference (RNAi)-based approach might offer
a potential therapy, making PLK1 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) a good
candidate for nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery. Until recently,
with the advancement in RNAi technologies as well as the ability of
PLK1 siRNA to suppress tumor growth in vivo,8,9 ways
for efficient delivery of PLK1 siRNA are being explored, and nanoparticle-based
delivery platforms are considered most promising for delivery of PLK1
siRNA. Unfortunately, achieving significant knockdown of PLK-1 resulting
into specific apoptosis has been a challenge at concentrations, which
do not result into off-target effects.

Even after years of research,
overcoming the bottlenecks in RNAi,
that is, efficient intracellular delivery and endosomal escape of
siRNA, is still a challenge. Toward this, a number of nanoparticle-based
strategies have been employed. It was suggested that the use of highly
charged primary amines can help in creating osmotic imbalance by sequestering
the protons, resulting into swelling and bursting of endosomes, thereby
releasing its contents into the cell cytoplasm, a process known as
proton-sponge effect.10 Unfortunately,
the toxicity imparted by the high positive charge, cell membrane damage,
and inability to release the siRNA from the complexes impedes their
application.11,12

Among the variety of nanoparticles
developed for siRNA delivery,13 polymeric
nanoparticles have generated a great
interest. Polymeric nanoparticles provide advantage of efficient loading
of small-molecule drugs for combination therapy as well as incorporation
of different functional groups for bioconjugation. The nanoparticles
of polymers such as chitosan, cationic dendrimers, and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) have been investigated for siRNA
delivery. Lower Coulombic attraction between siRNA and PLGA, less
efficient endosomal escape ability of PLGA, and cytotoxicity associated
with high-molecular-weight polymers are some of the concerns related
with these polymeric systems.14

Other
type of widely studied polymeric nanoparticles include poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) nanogels. These materials
belong to the category of “smart” nanogels because of
their thermoresponsivity. Additionally, the ease of synthesis, control
over the size, and transition temperatures makes them an ideal candidate
for a variety of biomedical applications.15 Despite the potential exhibited by these nanoparticles, their application
is limited by the toxicity imposed by depolymerization and bioaccumulation.
However, recent studies demonstrate the noncytotoxicity of pNIPAm
at concentrations relevant to biological applications.16 Additionally, in an in vivo study by Ankareddi
et al., the authors suggest that the pNIPAm oligomer does not pose
a biologically significant risk at relevant human dosages.17

Previous reports on the application of
pNIPAm nanogels for siRNA
delivery suggest enhancement in their delivery efficiency. Interestingly,
in most of the reports, the siRNA was loaded by “breathing-in”
technique, involving absorption of siRNA into the nanogels.18,19 As pNIPAm is a thermoresponsive polymer with volume-phase-transition
temperatures (VPTTs) close to the physiological temperature (37 °C),
at the body temperature, these nanogels become hydrophobic and undergo
deswelling. This can result in premature release of the absorbed cargo
as well as the hydrophobicity may affect their circulation. Although
a lot of work has been done on applications of pNIPAm-based materials
for RNAi, there are no reports on the systematic evaluation of how
the knockdown efficiencies can be further increased by better design
and by incorporating parameters to overcome the premature release
because of hydrophobicity at physiological temperature, endosomal
escape, and other critical requirements of RNAi.18,20,21

Herein, an efficient delivery platform
for the much-needed PLK-1
siRNA is reported. We developed two NIPAm-based, N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BIS, 5 mol
%) cross-linked nanogels, one with the composition 90 mol % NIPAm
and 5 mol % acrylic acid, and other with 80 mol % N-isopropylmethacrylamide (NIPMAm), 10 mol % NIPAm, and 5 mol % acrylic
acid. These nanogels are hereafter referred to as pNIPAm and p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) nanogel, respectively. NIPMAm was used to tune the VPTT of the nanogels.
NIPMAm consists of −CH3 group that resists deswelling
of the nanogels, thereby increasing the VPTT of NIPAm nanogels. The
acrylic acid in nanogels provides carboxyl group for post-synthesis
modifications. To impart the endosomal escape property, the carboxyl
groups of the nanogels were used for adsorbing a cationic polymer,
poly-ε-lysine (PεL), which further helps in loading siRNA
via Coulombic attraction (Scheme 1) and also in retaining siRNA in the nanogels. Additionally,
once inside, the positive charge of cationic polymer will be protected
by the nanogel, which may help in reducing the charge-dependent toxicity,
usually associated with such polymers.22

Scheme 1 Nanogels for siRNA Delivery
Results and Discussion
For achieving the goal of establishing
design principle for siRNA
delivery, based on polymeric systems, we undertook a systematic approach
elucidating the cell–material interaction. As highlighted earlier,
efficient loading and release of siRNA, cellular uptake of the siRNA-loaded
nanoparticles, and its endosomal escape capabilities are critical
design parameters for siRNA delivery vehicle. We began our studies
by the synthesis of pNIPAm and p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) nanogels by a well-established precipitation
polymerization method followed by their characterization. As these
are thermoresponsive nanogels, their VPTTs were determined by dynamic
light scattering (DLS). The VPTT of pNIPAm was ∼32 °C,
whereas that of p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) was ∼45 °C (Figure S1).
The precipitation polymerization resulted into pNIPAm and p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) nanogels of the size
55 ± 7 nm and 66 ± 3 nm with a surface charge of −11
± 3 mV and −20 ± 1 mV, respectively (Figure 1a,b). The negative charge can
be attributed to the anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and
the acrylic acid. Incorporation of monomers and the composition of
nanogels were also confirmed by 1H NMR of the nanogels
in deuterated water (Figure S2). The −CH3 peak observed at 0.95 ppm indicates the presence of pNIPMAm
in the nanogels (Figure S2a). siRNA can
be loaded into polymeric nanogels by conjugation, absorption, or Coulombic
interactions. As the conjugation involves modification of siRNA for
introducing a functional group, its bioactivity may be compromised.24 On the other hand, absorption may result in
premature release of the siRNA. Electrostatic interactions involving
cationic functional groups are therefore preferable for loading anionic
siRNA in the nanogels. The amine groups can be incorporated into the
polymeric nanogels either while synthesis by using amine comonomer
or by post-synthesis modifications. Incorporation of charged and hydrophilic
comonomer into the nanogels at higher mole percent is challenging
and results into low-colloidal stability and larger size of the nanogels.22 Thus, a post-synthesis incorporation strategy
was used. A cationic polymer PεL was adsorbed through the carboxyl
groups of the nanogel. After removing the excess of the cationic polymer
using a 100 kDa centrifugation filter, the size of the nanogels was
determined by DLS. It was observed that the nanogel size remained
unaltered (Figure 1a), indicating the absence of aggregation. Further, the positive
surface charge confirmed the adsorption of PεL in the nanogels
(Figure 1b). Interestingly,
after PεL addition, pNIPAm showed a zeta potential of +11 ±
2 mV, whereas p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) had +30 ± 4 mV. To understand the difference observed in the
charge on the nanogels, the amount of acrylic acid incorporated in
the nanogels was quantified by toluidine blue staining. pNIPAm nanogels
showed ∼1.5 times more −COOH incorporation than p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm). Therefore, the addition
of PεL to pNIPAm may result into neutralization of more amines,
thereby exhibiting a less net positive charge on the nanogel (Figure 1b). Further addition
of siRNA may therefore show more reduction in positive charge on p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) nanogels. Because
we are comparing the siRNA delivery efficiency of the nanogels, similar
loading of siRNA was ensured.

siRNA was loaded into the nanogels via the Coulombic
attraction
between the adsorbed cationic polymer and anionic siRNA. Amount of
nanogels required for the loading of siRNA was optimized using different
ratios of nanogel/siRNA (Figure S3). siRNA
loading resulted in reduction in the positive charge of both nanogels
(Figure 1b). Loading
of siRNA was also quantified by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy,
and both of the nanogels showed efficient loading, with ∼44%
encapsulation efficiencies. As the physical properties of these nanogels
are also governed by the temperature, their ability to retain siRNA
at physiological temperature was assessed by incubating the nanogel–siRNA
complex at 37 °C. siRNA-loaded pNIPAm and p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C
and centrifuged at 37 °C to separate any siRNA released from
the nanogel. The pellet and the supernatant thus obtained were then
run in agarose gel and stained for visualizing siRNA. As can be observed
in Figure 1c: lane
3–4 and lane 6–7, at 37 °C, a higher concentration
of siRNA was observed in the supernatant of the pNIPAm nanogel, whereas
p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) retained
most of it in the pellet. Further, the siRNA in the supernatant of
pNIPAm nanogel did not move as compared to the free siRNA, suggesting
that probably the entire PεL–siRNA complex was desorbed
and released at 37 °C. Release of siRNA from pNIPAm may be attributed
to the low negative charge on the nanogels (Figure 1b), resulting into poor Coulombic attraction
between the PεL and nanogel, eventually leading to desorption
of PεL along with siRNA above its VPTT. This study, therefore,
suggests that p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) might be a better candidate for siRNA delivery as it is able to
retain the loaded siRNA more efficiently than the pNIPAm nanogel.
Loading siRNA into the nanoparticles is also known to protect them
from serum nucleases. Therefore, the serum stability of the loaded
siRNA was investigated by gel electrophoresis. As can be observed
in Figure S4, no significant degradation
of the siRNA was observed even after 24 h of incubation with serum.
For biological applications, cellular internalization and biocompatibility
of delivery systems is crucial. For studying the internalization of
nanogels, rhodamine-tagged pNIPAm and p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) were synthesized (Figure S5). HeLa cells were incubated with the nanogels for
4 h, followed by analysis by flow cytometry. As can be observed in Figure 2a, both of the nanogels
were efficiently internalized by HeLa cells. Slight increase in the
fluorescence intensity was observed by pNIPAm nanogels as compared
to p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm), which
can be because of the incorporation of more rhodamine in pNIPAm as
observed by UV–vis spectroscopy (Figure S4). Similar results were observed for MDA-MB-231, a breast
cancer cell line (Figure S6a). Interestingly,
internalization of fluorescein-labeled siRNA by HeLa cells showed
∼85% uptake for p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm)-mediated delivery, whereas only ∼40% was observed for pNIPAm
(Figure 2b). These
results are indeed in accordance with the siRNA release observed at
37 °C (Figure 1c) and suggest that even though the uptake of both of the nanogels
is similar, their siRNA delivery efficiency varies. Compatibility
of the nanogels with the biological system was studied by assessing
the hemocompatibility and cell viability. At higher concentrations,
polylysine is known to interact and damage the cell membrane. To determine
the toxicity because of membrane damage, hemolytic ability of the
nanogels was analyzed. PεL-adsorbed pNIPAM and p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) were incubated with
erythrocytes at a physiological pH for 30 min at 37 °C, and the
hemoglobin released because of membrane damage was quantified spectrophotometrically.
As observed in Figure 2c, the hemoglobin release was under the acceptable range (below 5%),
suggesting hemocompatibility of the systems. Further, to evaluate
the cytotoxic effect, cell viability was assessed by monitoring the
ability of cells to metabolize (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) (MTT). The cell viability was observed to be above 90% in
HeLa cells as well as MDA-MB-231 cell line for the nanogels even with
adsorbed PεL (Figures 2d and S6b). Additionally, to gain
insights on the endocytosis pathway accessed by the nanogels for cellular
entry, colocalization of nanogels with endosomes was probed. Cells
were incubated with rhodamine-labeled nanogels and then selectively
stained for endosomes using lysotracker. Colocalization observed by
fluorescence microscopy (Figure S7) suggested
that the nanogels entered via the endocytosis pathway. It is well-known
that endosomal entrapment is a bottleneck in siRNA delivery.25 Therefore, endosomal escape ability of the nanogels
using a simple calcein assay (Figure 3a) was evaluated. When cells are exposed to nanogels
and calcein, a cell impermeable dye, both (nanogels and calcein) gets
entrapped into endosomes during the vesicle formation. This results
into punctate fluorescence in cell cytoplasm. When calcein-loaded
endosomes get disrupted, the calcein gets released into the cytoplasm,
yielding a diffused fluorescence in the cytoplasm. The pNIPAm and
p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) nanogels
by themselves were unable to disrupt endosomes efficiently, whereas
with adsorbed PεL, only p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) was able to show endosomal escape (Figure 3b,c). This was also
confirmed by analyzing the fluorescence intensity profiles of calcein-
and rhodamine-labeled nanogels in cells by orthogonal confocal microscopy
(Figure S8). Similar to the gel retardation
study performed at 37 °C (Figure 1c), these results again suggests that at 37 °C,
the PεL and siRNA gets desorbed from pNIPAm nanogels before
entering the cells, thereby reducing the endosomal escape ability
of PεL-adsorbed pNIPAm. In comparison, as the VPTT of p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) is above 37 °C,
the PεL is retained in these nanogels and available for the
proton-sponge effect into the endosome, leading to endosomal escape.

Finally, the ability of both of
the nanogels to induce gene silencing
was investigated, by monitoring cell viability, apoptosis, and quantification
of gene expression levels by RT-PCR, on delivery of PLK1 siRNA in
HeLa cells. Cell viability was studied by MTT assay, 36 h post-transfection
of siRNA-loaded nanogels. Similar to the earlier reports, while ∼20%
cell death was observed at 75 nM for pNIPAm, p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) showed ∼35% cell death (Figure 4a). As PLK1 induces
cell death by activation of the cellular apoptotic pathways, apoptosis
was assessed using Annexin-V–propidium iodide staining. Annexin-V
binds to phosphatidylserine, a marker for early apoptosis, whereas
propidium iodide stains cells in late apoptosis whose membrane is
compromised. Nanogels loaded with scrambled siRNA were used as a negative
control. As can be observed in Figure 4b, comparable apoptosis was observed for p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) and pNIPAm at lower
siRNA concentration (30 nM) after 24 h incubation. Further, increase
in siRNA concentration to 75 nM resulted in twofold increase in apoptosis
(32%) for p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm). Confirming our endosomal escape observation, pNIPAm showed a lower
knockdown as compared to p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm). The knockdown effect of p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) was specific as a scrambled siRNA (75 nM) loaded
in the nanogel did not show any significant knockdown, whereas the
positive control, lipofectamine-loaded with PLK1 siRNA (75 nM), showed
∼20% knockdown in 24 h which is in accordance with the literature.26,27 The knockdown of PLK-1 by nanogels was also observed to be cell
line independent, as similar trends were observed for a breast cancer
cell line, MDA-MB-231 (Figure S6c). In
fact, the knockdown was higher in MDA-MB-231 as compared to HeLa,
which can be attributed to the PLK-1 sensitivity because of p53 mutation
in MDA-MB-231.28,29 These results were interesting
because by means of better design of nanoparticles, which takes into
account the endosomal escape, loading efficiency, and retention of
siRNA, the knockdown higher than the gold standard, lipofectamine,
was achieved. For confirming if the apoptosis was PLK1-specific, the
expression level of PLK1 was quantified by RT-PCR (Figure 4c). At 30 nM, expression was
reduced twofold for pNIPAm, whereas p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) resulted into an ∼fourfold reduction.
Increasing siRNA concentration did not result in significant downregulation
for pNIPAm nanogels whereas p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) showed a 10-fold decrease in gene expression.
Knockdown at such a low siRNA concentration is exciting as that at
higher concentrations (∼100 nM); off-target effects are observed
because of the activation of toll-like-receptors.30−32 The enhanced
siRNA delivery capability of p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) nanogels can be attributed to better loading
and the nanogel’s biologically relevant VPTT. Thus, these results
clearly demonstrate how insights into the cell–material interaction
can be utilized to change the material’s properties for increasing
the efficacy of the desired biological process.

In conclusion, PεL-adsorbed
pNIPAm and p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) nanogels can be loaded with siRNA,
are easily internalized and well-tolerated by cells, and can protect
siRNA from serum nucleases. Owing to the thermoresponsive properties,
only p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm)
nanogel showed the ability of efficient endosomal escape and a significant
knockdown even at low siRNA concentrations. Our report also signifies
the importance of understanding the cell–material interactions
in the development of efficient delivery materials.

Synthesis of Nanogels
pNIPAm- and
poly-N-isopropylmethacrylamide (pNIPMAm)-based nanogels
of compositions
given in Table 1 with
a total monomer concentration of ∼70 mM were synthesized using
the well-known precipitation polymerization method, owing to the ease
of synthesis and control over the size. Briefly, the synthesis was
carried out in a three-neck round-bottom flask with a condenser. The
required amount of monomers (except acrylic acid) and SDS (final concentration:
2 mM) were dissolved in deionized water and filtered through a 0.2
μm filter. The mixture was then purged with nitrogen at 70 °C
for 1 h. After 1 h, the calculated volume of acrylic acid was added
to the reaction mixture, followed by addition of freshly prepared
APS (final concentration: 0.4 mg/mL). After ∼15 min, the reaction
mixture turned turbid, indicating the polymer synthesis. The reaction
was continued for 4 h under N2 environment, followed by
stirring until it cooled down to the room temperature (∼25
°C). Thus, formed nanoparticles were cleaned by dialysis against
distilled water using a 12 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane for 48 h, with
water changed every 12 h and lyophilized for storage.

The
nanogels were resuspended in deionized water and characterized
by DLS for hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential, using the Malvern
Zetasizer Nano ZS90 system equipped with a 633 nm laser and 90°
scattering optics. For determining the VPTTs, the hydrodynamic diameter
of the nanoparticles was recorded at different temperatures.

Synthesis
of Rhodamine-Tagged Nanogels
Rhodamine (5
mg, 0.01 mmol, 1 equiv) was dissolved in 5 mL of deionized water and
reacted with EDC (19.1 mg, 0.1 mmol, 10 equiv) and NHS (92 mg, 0.2
mmol, 20 equiv) at room temperature for 30 min. This was followed
by the addition of APMA (1.8 mg, 0.01 mmol, 1 equiv) to the reaction
mixture and further incubation for 4 h. Thus, formed APMA–rhodamine
conjugate was used directly for the synthesis of nanogels. Rhodamine-labeled
nanogels of compositions (a) 89.9% NIPAm, 0.1% APMA–rhodamine,
5% BIS, and 5% acrylic acid and (b) 79.9% NIPMAm, 10% NIPAM, 0.1%
APMA–rhodamine, 5% BIS, and 5% acrylic acid, with the total
monomer concentration of ∼70 mM were synthesized using the
protocol same as that for p(NIPAm) and p(NIPMAm-co-NIPAm) nanogels. The nanogels were purified
by dialysis against distilled water using a 12 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane
for 48 h with water replaced every 4 h and lyophilized for storage.
The nanogels were characterized by DLS using Malvern Zetasizer Nano
ZS90. Incorporation of rhodamine in nanoparticles was confirmed by
UV–vis spectroscopy using BioTek Synergy H1 multiplate reader.

Adsorption of PεL in the Nanogels and Loading of siRNA
Nanogels (2.5 mg) were resuspended in 500 μL of nuclease-free
deionized water. To it was added 100 μL of 50 mg/mL PεL
(20 kDa) and incubated for 15 min. The unadsorbed PεL was removed
using the 100 kDa MWCO filters by centrifuging it at 8000g for 5 min. Approximately, 100 μL of the sample was retained
in the filter which was resuspended in nuclease-free deionized water
(400 μL) resulting into a ∼5 mg/mL nanogel concentration.
For loading siRNA, 10 μL of 5 mg/mL nanogel was incubated with
10 μL of 10 μM siRNA for 30 min at room temperature. The
nanogels were then centrifuged at 20 817g for
30 min and siRNA left in the supernatant was quantified by UV–vis
spectroscopy using BioTek Synergy H1 multiplate reader. The percent
encapsulation efficiency was calculated as follows  

Release of siRNA from Nanogels
The siRNA-loaded nanogels
were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 20 817g for 30 min at 37 °C, using an Eppendorf 5810 R centrifuge.
The supernatant was used as it is, whereas the pellet was resuspended
in nuclease-free deionized water. To each sample, 5 μL of glycerol
was added and was loaded in 1% agarose gel. The gel was run at 70
V for 20 min in Tris borate EDTA (TBE buffer) (pH 8). The nanogels
incubated at room temperature (∼25 °C) were used as controls.
siRNA was then stained by incubating the gel into SYBR Green for 1
h and imaged using UVP GelDoc IT2 Imager.

Toluidine Blue Staining
The amount of acrylic acid
incorporated in the nanogels was quantified by a colorimetric method
using toluidine blue staining. Nanogels (3 mg) were incubated with
1 mL of 0.5 mM toluidine blue solution (pH 10) for 4 h at 37 °C.
The nanogels were then washed with NaOH (pH 10) to remove unbound
dye molecules. The bound toluidine blue was then desorbed from nanogels
by adding 1 mL of 50% acetic acid solution. The absorbance of solution
was measured using Biotek Synergy H1 multiplate reader and the amount
of carboxylic acid present was extrapolated from a standard curve
obtained using toluidine blue.

Serum Stability of siRNA-Loaded
in Nanogels
The siRNA-loaded
nanogels were incubated with 10% FBS incubated for 30 min and 24 h
at 37 °C. Free siRNA treated with 10% FBS was used as a negative
control, whereas the untreated one as a positive control. They were
then loaded in 1% agarose gel using glycerol (5 μL). The gel
was run at 70 V for 1 h in TBE buffer (pH 8). siRNA was stained by
incubating gel into SYBR Green for 1 h and imaged using UVP GelDoc
IT2 Imager.

Hemolysis Assay
Hemolysis assay
was performed by adding
nanogels at different concentrations to 50 μL of 10% erythrocytes
to a final volume of 250 μL in PBS. After incubation at 37 °C
for 30 min, cells were centrifuged at 1000g for 5
min, and an absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 540 nm to
quantify cell lysis. Cells untreated with nanogels were used as negative
control, whereas cells incubated with 10% Triton X-100 as positive
control.

Maintaining the Cell Lines
Human cervical cancer cell
lines, HeLa, and human bone osteosarcoma cell line MG-63 were maintained
in DMEM supplemented by 10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified
5% CO2 incubator. Breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231,
was maintained in Leibovitz’s L-15 media supplemented with
10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C under atmospheric CO2 concentration. The media were changed every 2 days, and the cells
were passaged after 80% confluency. Same conditions were used for
respective cell lines while performing the experiments.

Cellular Internalization
of Rhodamine-Tagged Nanogels and Fluorescein-Tagged
siRNA (FL-siRNA) by Flow Cytometry
At a confluency of 80%,
cells were trypsinized, seeded in 500 μL media in a 24-well
plate at the seeding density of 5 × 104 cells per
well, and cultured overnight at 37 °C under respective conditions.
The media were then replaced with media containing rhodamine-tagged
nanogels at the concentration of ∼25 μg/mL and incubated
for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with PBS
(5 min each), followed by a brief wash with 0.01% Tween20 and three
more washes of PBS (5 min each). They were then trypsinized, centrifuged
at 664g, and resuspended in PBS. The uptake was analyzed
by assessing the increase in fluorescence intensity of cells as compared
to the cells without nanoparticle treatment, using the FL2 channel
(ex/em 488 nm/585 ± 20 nm) of the BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer.
Similarly, to study uptake of siRNA, FL-siRNAs were loaded in nanogels
and the uptake was analyzed by flow cytometry.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity
of Nanogels by MTT Assay
At a
confluency of 80%, cells were trypsinized, seeded in 200 μL
of media at a density of 104 cells per well in a 96-well
plate and cultured overnight at 37 °C under respective conditions.
The spent medium was then replaced with media containing varying concentrations
of nanogels, with or without siRNA. After 6 h, the media were removed
and fresh media were added, and the cells were further incubated for
24 h or 36 h. Media were then removed, and fresh media containing
MTT at the final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL were added over the cells.
Cells were further incubated for 1 h to allow formation of the purple,
insoluble, formazan crystals. MTT-containing media were then removed,
and the crystals were dissolved using 200 μL of DMSO. The absorbance
of the samples was then recorded at 550 nm using a BioTek Synergy
H1 multiplate reader. Cells untreated with nanogels were considered
as the control.

Calcein Assay for Studying Endosomal Escape
in HeLa Cell Line
by Fluorescence Microscopy
Circular glass coverslips (12
mm diameter) were sterilized by immersing in absolute ethanol overnight.
They were transferred in a 24-well plate and washed with PBS. Cells
at a seeding density of 5 × 104 per well were cultured
overnight in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Calcein, a
cell membrane impermeable dye, gets entrapped into the endocytotic
vesicles, thus resulting into punctate fluorescence in the cells.
If these vesicles rupture, the calcein is released into the cytoplasm
leading to a diffused fluorescence.23 The
cells were therefore incubated with media-containing calcein (0.1
mg/mL) as well as rhodamine-tagged nanogels (∼25 μg/mL)
and incubated for 4 h. Cells were washed with PBS and observed under
an Olympus IX73 fluorescence microscope using a TRITC filter or an
Olympus confocal microscope. Images were pseudocolored using ImageJ.
At least 50 cells per sample were analyzed to quantitate the endosomal
escape. Images were processed in Fluoview software to analyze z-stacked
confocal microscopy images in an orthogonal view.

Evaluation
of siRNA-Mediated Silencing of PLK1 by Apoptosis
Assay and RT-PCR
The cells were seeded in a 24-well plate
at the seeding density of 5 × 104 cells per well and
incubated overnight at 37 °C in CO2 incubator. Cells
were then washed with PBS, followed by the addition of PLK1 siRNA-loaded
nanogels in a serum-free media, such that siRNA concentration was
30 and 75 nM. Nanogel-containing media were replaced with fresh serum-supplemented
media, and cells were incubated for 24 h.

For collecting detached
cells undergoing apoptosis, the spent media were centrifuged at 664g for 5 min, whereas the adhered cells were first trypsinized
before centrifugation. The cells were then washed two times with ice-cold
PBS and stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI using the manufacturer’s
protocol. The cells were then analyzed using FL1 (ex/em 488/533 ±
15) and FL3 (ex/em 488/>670) channels of BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer.
Cell transfected with PLK1 siRNA using lipofectamine were used as
the positive control, whereas those with scrambled siRNA-loaded nanogel
as a negative control.

For quantifying mRNA expression, RNA
was isolated from cells using
TRIzol reagent and cDNA was synthesized using manufacturer’s
protocol. A 10 μL PCR reaction was set using 2 μL of cDNA.
The PCR cycle used was enzyme activation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed
by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, and 56 °C for 5 s. Melt curve
was recorded from 65 to 95 °C with 0.5 °C intervals. As
an internal control, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
was used. Same PCR protocol was followed for GAPDH, except that the
extension temperature used was 54 °C instead of 56 °C. Lipofectamine-mediated
PLK1 siRNA transfected cells were used as positive control, whereas
those with scrambled siRNA-loaded nanogel as negative control. Sequence
of PLK1 primers: forward, 5′-CCCATCTTCTGGGTCAGCAAG-3′
and reverse, 5′-AAGAGCACCCCCACGCTGTT-3′. Sequence of
GAPDH primers: forward, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3′ and
reverse, 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3′.
