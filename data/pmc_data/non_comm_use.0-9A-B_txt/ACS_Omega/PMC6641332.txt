The conversion of
troponyl alkylglycinate acid/ester/amide derivatives
(Trag acid/ester/amide) into cationic troponyl lactones
(CTLs) in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid and
their amidation with amines is described. The reversible amidation
of Trag amides, that is, the cleavage and reformation
of the Trag amide bond via CTLs is
demonstrated. The direct amidation of Trag esters
with the amino group of amino acid esters/peptide esters via CTLs is achieved. The direct amidation of the amine group
of hydroxyl amino acid esters is selective over esterification. The Trag amide bond is stable under basic ester hydrolysis and
Fmoc removal conditions. Hence, the troponyl alkylglycinates could
be applicable as protecting groups for amine functionality of amino
acids and peptides. The reaction mechanism was investigated by using
a deuterium probe and studied by NMR and electrospray ionisation mass
spectrometry techniques. Deuterium incorporation at α-CH2 strongly supported the formation of CTLs via ketene intermediates.

1 Introduction
Amide
bonds are one of the most important and essential chemical
bonds of biopolymers (proteins and peptides) and many bioactive molecules.1 The synthesis of the amide bond is well-established
from carboxylic acid and free amine in the presence of activating
reagents.2 Importantly, many methods are
also available in the literature for the synthesis of the amide bond
directly from carboxylic acid esters and amine in the presence of
a metal catalyst and under constrained conditions such as high temperatures.3 The typical amide bonds are chemically robust
and stable under physiological conditions. However, they can be cleavable
under strong acidic or basic conditions at room/high temperatures.4 The stability of acyclic amide bonds is due to
their resonance stabilization.4 On the
other hand, strained cyclic lactams and nonplanar amide bonds have
less amidic resonance stabilization because of nonplanarity of the
amide bond.4 As a result, they are more
reactive toward the nucleophilic addition reaction and are easily
cleavable under mild conditions.4 In the
literature, solvolysis of strained cyclic lactams and nonplanar amides
is extensively studied.4 Further, the activation
of amide bonds toward solvolysis by introducing electron-withdrawing
groups at α-carbon is also demonstrated.4d Overall, the stability of amide bonds mainly depends on
the nature of the substituents at α-carbon of amide carbonyl
and amide N-atom, which affect the steric and electronic environment
of the respective amide bonds immensely.4 The cleavage of amide bonds with metal catalysts is also explored.5

Generally, the acyclic amide bonds derived
from N,N-dialkyl glycine residues
are quite stable, almost
like other amide bonds. However, we have recently reported the cleavage
of acyclic amide bonds derived from troponyl aminoethylglycine (Traeg) residues into esters under mild acidic conditions
(Figure 1A).6b Further, a plausible reaction mechanism for
the cleavage of Traeg amide bonds via a reactive
ketene intermediate is proposed based on the control experiments and
literature reports.6b The cleavage of Traeg amide bonds into “cationic troponyl
lactone” was also observed during the mechanistical
investigations. Previously reported control experiments revealed that
the troponyl moiety and α-CH2 of the glycinate unit
of Traeg residues play a key role in the cleavage of the Traeg amide bond.6b Such kind of organic transformations
are unusual and interesting to explore. Hence, in-depth understanding
with experimental evidences and exploring potential applications of
this unusual amide cleavage is very important.

methanolysis of Traeg amides.

Herein, we report the syntheses
and characterization of different
cationic troponyl lactones (CTLs) from troponyl alkylglycinate
amides and also from the Trag acid/esters derivatives.
The reversible amidation: cleavage and reformation of the same Trag amide bond via CTLs is demonstrated
(Figure 1B). The direct
amidation of Trag esters/acid derivatives with amines
via CTLs is described. The high probability of formation
of CTLs via a reactive ketene intermediate is described
by probing the reaction mechanism with deuterium labeling. The stability
of Trag amide bonds under basic ester hydrolysis
conditions and Fmoc removal conditions is demonstrated. Therefore,
troponyl alkylglycinates could be potential candidates for the protection
of amine groups of amino acids, peptides, and bioactive molecules
through direct amidation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Syntheses of Troponyl Alkylglycinate Derivatives
We
began this study with the syntheses of troponyl alkylglycinate
esters and amides by following previously reported procedures (Scheme 1A,B).6 Our previously reported troponyl aminoethylglycine amides
contain N-Boc aminoethyl groups at glycinate nitrogen.6bTraeg amides and Boc protecting
groups are cleavable in acidic conditions. Hence, to avoid the interruption
of the acid labile Boc protecting group in exploring the reactivity
and potential applications of Traeg amide cleavage,
the N-Boc aminoethyl group of Traeg is replaced with
the alkyl chains.

Troponyl alkylglycinate esters
(3a–d) are synthesized
by following Scheme 1A. N-Troponyl amino acid esters such as N-troponyl proline ester (3e), N-troponyl glycine ester, and N-troponyl phenylalanine
ester are synthesized by following Scheme 1B. Troponyl alkylglycinate amides (4a–d) and N-troponyl proline amides
(4e/f) were synthesized through standard peptide coupling
conditions.7N-Troponyl
glycine (3aa) and N-troponyl phenylalanine
(3ab) were synthesized to test the role of alkyl groups
at glycinate nitrogen of Trag derivatives in formation
of CTLs. All the synthesized new compounds are characterized
by NMR and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and
their spectral data are provided in the Supporting Information.

2.2 Reversible Amidation
In our pervious
report, the formation of CTLs from troponyl aminoethylglycine
amides was observed in the presence of 6.0 equiv of trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) in CD3CN. Therefore, the troponyl octylglycinate
amide 4b was treated with 6.0 equiv of TFA in CD3CN to obtain CTL5b and which
was studied by NMR (Scheme 2). The 13C NMR spectra clearly show the disappearance
of troponyl carbonyl carbon and amide carbonyl carbon peaks after
treatment with TFA. The appearance of new peaks representing the same
carbons in CTL5b was noticed. The cationic
carbon of CTL5b reportedly appeared
between δ 150–156 and lactone carbonyl appeared most
likely at δ 161 (Figure 2A).8

the formation of respective CTLs. (A) 13C NMR of 4b in CD3CN obtained after 50 min
of TFA treatment, showing the formation of 5b. (B) 13C NMR of 3b-OH in CD3CN obtained

obtained after 6 h of TFA treatment, showing the formation of 3aa-H+.

Scheme 2 Reversible Amidation of Troponyl Alkylglycinate Amides (4a–f) via CTLs
The mass spectra of the same sample exhibit
a prominent mass peak
at m/z 274.0 (M+) which
is equivalent to the calculated molecular mass (m/z) of CTL5b. These
NMR and ESI-MS studies strongly supported the formation of CTL5b from Trag amide 4b after TFA treatment within 30 min. Similar experiments
were performed with other Trag amides 4a/c–e and characterized the formation of respective CTLs5a/c–e by NMR and ESI-MS (Scheme 2, conversion >95%; predicted from NMR,
see
SI for representative spectral data). All CTLs5a–e synthesized from 4a–e contain
glycine ester and TFA peaks in their respective 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The formation of CTLs5a–f from Trag amides 4a–f in the presence of 6.0 equiv of TFA in CD3CN/CH3CN is confirmed.

Next, the reactivity of CTLs5a–e was investigated. The CTL5b was converted
into troponyl alkylglycinate ethyl ester as 3b in the
presence of excess EtOH, which revealed that the hydroxyl nucleophile
is reacting with lactone carbonyl and leads to lactone ring opening
to give Trag ester 3b. On the basis
of this, we envisaged that the neutralization of the reaction mixture
containing CTL5b and the protonated
glycine ester (H3N+–CH2–COOMe)
leads to the formation of Trag amide 4b. The neutralization results in the generation of free amine nucleophile
as amino acid ester (H2N–CH2–COOMe)
which will react with lactone carbonyl carbon of CTL5b and forms the amide bond to give Trag amide 4b.

As expected, neutralization of the
reaction mixture containing CTL5b and
glycine ester salt with Et3N at 0 °C produced the
starting material 4b within
10 min (isolated yield 71%, Scheme 2). Similarly, other CTLs5a/c–e obtained from 4a/c–e were also subjected for
the reversible amidation under similar conditions and isolated the
starting materials 4a/c–e in good to moderated
yields (Scheme 2).
The amide cleavage and reformation was monitored by NMR in CD3CN and ESI-MS. The obtained spectral data clearly revealed
the cleavage and reformation of the Trag amide bond
via CTL5b under given conditions. The
representative 1H/13C NMR spectral data are
provided in the Supporting Information (Figures
S1 and S2). The formation of undesired products was observed during
the reversible amidation reaction. Hence, isolated yields of Trag amides 4 after reversible amidation were
decreased. We noticed that the amidation of CTLs is
faster than esterification even in the presence of a stoichiometric
amount of amines.

Trag
The reversible amidation, cleavage (30 min)
and reformation (10
min) of the amide bond 4 via CTLs5 within 45 min is confirmed. The cleavage
and reformation of the same amide bond occurs via a CTL intermediate, and hence, this reaction can be called as reversible
amidation. So far, no such reports for the reversible amidation reaction
are available in the literature.

2.3 Direct
Amidation
After confirming
the formation of CTLs5a–e from Trag amides 4a–f, we were curious to
explore the reactivity of Trag esters (3) in the presence of TFA in acetonitrile. At first, the Trag ester 3b was treated with TFA (6.0 equiv) in CD3CN and studied the formation of CTL5b by NMR. The NMR studies revealed that the CTL5b is forming from Trag ester 3b at room temperature within 6–8 h (Scheme 3). However, the conversion
is relatively slower than the respective amide 4b and
also incomplete even after 8 h (>75%). This reaction was monitored
by 1H NMR, and 6.0 equiv of TFA was added to the Trag ester 3b in CD3CN and characterized
by 1H NMR with 15 min time intervals for 3 h. These NMR
results revealed the immediate protonation of troponyl carbonyl oxygen
after the addition of TFA and formation of 3-H+ (Figures S5–S7).
The slow reaction is most probably due to the reversible reaction
between 3-H+ and 5, which is already discussed.
The obtained spectral data are provided in the Supporting Information. Similarly, other Trag esters 3a/c–e were subjected to the formation
of CTLs in the presence of TFA in CD3CN. 1H/13C NMR experiments confirmed the formation of
respective CTLs5a/c–e. Importantly,
in case of slow conversion (<75%), up to 8.0 equiv of TFA was used
to enhance the conversion.

Scheme 3 Amidation of Trag Esters/Acids
via CTLs5a–e with Benzyl Amine
Next, Trag carboxylic acid derivatives 3b-OH/3c-OH were also subjected
to CTLs syntheses in the presence
of 6.0 equiv of TFA in CD3CN and studied by NMR (Figure 2B). These studies
revealed the formation of respective CTLs5b/c from 3b/c-OH with almost quantitatively (∼95.0%, Figures 2B and S3 and S4) within 3 h. In contrast to Trag esters 3a–e, the acid derivatives 3b/c-OH convert into respective CTLs more
efficiently.

These freshly prepared CTLs5a–e in CD3CN were then employed for the
amidation with the
amine group in Scheme 3. The CTLs obtained from 3a–e in the presence of TFA in CD3CN were treated with benzylamine,
followed by neutralization with Et3N (6.5–8.5 equiv)
at 0 °C to room temperature to obtain respective amides 6a–e. These amides were isolated in 57–70% yields. Trag monomers were also isolated (10–15%) along with
these amides. The formation of CTLs from Trag ester/acid derivatives 3a–e and 3b/c-OH and their amidation are confirmed. Such kind of reactivity
of carboxylic acid/esters under abovementioned conditions is not known
in the literature. The formation of CTLs5a–e from troponyl alkylglycinate acid/ester derivatives (3/3-OH) is a major breakthrough of this work which facilitated the amidation
of Trag acid/esters via a CTL intermediate.

Encouraged by the direct amidation of CTLs derived
from Trag esters 3a–e, we sought
to explore the potential applications of this unusual amide cleavage.
For this purpose, amino acid esters and di/tripeptides as amines were
employed for amidation with Trag esters 3b/c via respective CTLs5b/c in CH3CN under optimized conditions (Scheme 4). As shown in Scheme 4, which demonstrates direct amidation of
troponyl alkylglycinate esters and acids (3b/c and 3b/c-OH) with amino acid ester and peptide amines, we have
employed various amino acid esters/peptide esters (including hydroxyl
amino acid esters) for direct amidation with troponyl octylglycinate 3b under already optimized conditions. We have synthesized
the Trag-containing peptides 4c/7–15 from respective amino acid/peptide esters through direct amidation
(Scheme 4). The use
of 1.0 equiv of 3b and 1.2 equiv of amines provided the
isolated yields of amides 7–15 in 35–53%,
and 3b was isolated in ∼15% (Scheme 4. Condition A). The decrease
in isolated yields of 7–15 is due to incomplete
conversion of 3b-H+ to reactive CTL5b. The formation of undesired products
which could not be isolated and characterized was also observed (Figure S23).

Scheme 4 Amidation of Trag Ester 3b/c with Amino
Acid/Peptide Esters
We attempted to improve the reaction conditions to demonstrate
the application of troponyl alkylglycinates as possible protecting
groups for amine functionality. The amine starting material was considered
as 1.0 equiv, and Trag was taken as 2.0 equiv (Scheme 4. Condition B). In
this case, reasonable enhancement in isolated yields of 7–15 was observed for particular amides. For example, under reaction
conditions A, 7 was isolated in 46%. While under reaction
conditions B, 7 was isolated in 70% (Scheme 4A). The use of 2.0 equiv of Trog-OEt (3b) improved the yields of desired
amides 7–15, and the Trog-OEt
(3b) is isolated in 20–32%. We observed that the
reaction worked more efficiently with freshly prepared amine trifluoroacetate
salts [Boc-deprotected peptide esters with 30% TFA in dichloromethane
(DCM)] when compare to amino acid ester hydrochlorides. In the case
of amino acid ester hydrochlorides, the amino acid ester was first
neutralized with 1.5 equiv of Et3N in a minimum amount
of CH3CN before amidation reaction.

The direct amidation
of troponyl octylglycinate/troponyl dodecylglycinate
with amino acid/peptide esters was carried out in several ways. The
amidation of CTLs is a very fast reaction. Hence,
the generation of a free amine nucleophile on time to react with CTL during neutralization is important. The delay in generation
of free amine nucleophile in the reaction mixture during neutralization
causes the formation of more undesired products, and as a result,
yields of desired Trag amides were decreased.

Importantly, only the amino group of hydroxyl amino acid esters
was reacted with CTLs5 to give respective
amides 12–15 (serine ethyl ester/threonine methyl
ester/tyrosine methyl ester/4-hydroxy proline methyl ester, Scheme 4B). We could not
observe hydroxyl-protected amino acid/peptide derivatives. As already
mentioned, the most probable reason for this is that the amidation
of CTLs is faster than esterification. Hence, CTLs can react selectively and rapidly with the amine functional
group in the presence of the hydroxyl functional group to give Trag amides. Overall, the troponyl alkylglycinates would
be attached to an amine functional group of amino acids esters and
peptide esters without the use of peptide coupling reagents via CTL intermediates. Moreover, the substituent at the glycinate
nitrogen could be changed as per requirements. Therefore, these molecules
could be used in the design of prodrugs containing hydroxyl and amino
functional groups.

2.4 Control Experiments
Next, the necessity
of an alkyl substituent for the formation of CTLs from Trag derivatives is studied. Troponyl glycine 3aa and troponyl phenylalanine 3ab were treated
with TFA (6.0 equiv) in CD3CN and studied by NMR (Scheme 5). The analysis of
obtained spectra revealed that no formation of CTLs was observed, and only protonation of troponyl carbonyl oxygen was
characterized (Figure 2A). Even after 3 days, no change in spectra was observed. From these
studies, it is confirmed that the alkyl group at glycinate nitrogen
is necessary for the formation of CTLs.

Scheme 5 Role of
the Alkyl Substituent at Glycinate Nitrogen in Formation
of CTLs
To demonstrate the troponyl alkylglycinates as orthogonal
protecting
groups, the stability of Trag-AA-OMe amide bonds
was investigated under basic conditions such as ester hydrolysis conditions
and Fmoc removal conditions.

Peptides 8/11 were
treated with aq NaOH in MeOH/THF
at room temperature (Scheme 6A). No amide hydrolysis of Trag-AA-OMe was
observed under these conditions. Only selective ester hydrolyzed products 8/11-OH were obtained quantitatively (Page S114–117). Thus, Trag containing
amide bonds are stable under ester hydrolysis conditions. The stability
of Trag amides under Fmoc removal conditions was
also demonstrated. Peptides 8/14 were treated with 20%
piperidine in dimethylformamide (DMF) for 4 h and analyzed by ESI-MS.
These experimental results revealed that Trag amides
are stable under standard Fmoc removal conditions (Scheme 6B). The troponyl alkylglycinates
would be attached at the amine group of amino acid and peptide esters
via CTLs, and the Trag-AA-OMe amide
bond is stable under basic ester hydrolysis and standard Fmoc removal
conditions. Moreover, the Trag-(AA)n-OMe amide bond is selectively cleavable under mild conditions
(Scheme 6C; Figures S26–S28). Hence, troponyl alkylglycinates
could be applicable as orthogonal protecting groups for amino functionality.

and Fmoc Removal Conditions and Regioselective Cleavage of the Trag Amide Bond
2.5 Mechanism Investigation
2.5.1 Deuteration
of Glycinate α-CH2 with TFA-D
A plausible
reaction mechanism for the
cleavage of the troponyl aminoethylglycine amide bond via a reactive
ketene intermediate is described in our previous report.6b The reaction mechanism was proposed based on
the control experiments and literature reports.4d,9 These
control experiments revealed the key role of α-CH2 and the troponyl moiety in the cleavage of the amide bond. However,
understanding the role of glycinate α-CH2 in the
formation of CTLs with experimental evidences is
very important. Hence, we have attempted to probe the reaction mechanism
using deuterium labeling.10 We envisaged
that if the glycinate α-CH2 involved in the reaction,
deprotonation and reprotonation of α-CH2 would occur.
Hence, performing the reaction with deuterated TFA may lead to exchange
of α-CH2 protons with deuterium in the resultant CTLs and Trag amides.

At the outset, Trag amide 4b was treated with deuterated TFA
(6.0 equiv of TFA-D) in CD3CN to obtain respective CTLs and studied by NMR and ESI-MS (Scheme 7A). The obtained 1H NMR spectrum
exhibits a broad triplet along with a singlet at δ 4.61–4.60,
and the 13C NMR spectra also exhibit a triplet along with
a singlet at δ 52–50, unlike 1H/13C NMR spectra of 5b obtained in the presence of TFA
(comparative NMR spectral data are provided in Figure 3A–D). Further, the mass spectra of
the same sample exhibit mass peaks at m/z 275 along with m/z 274 (M+) (Figure S20). NMR and MS results
revealed the deuteration of α-CH2 of the glycinate
unit happens in the presence of TFA-D in CD3CN. These triplet
peaks in 1H/13C NMR represent the proton and
carbon of α-CHD (Figure 3A,C). Then, Trag amides 4a/c were also subjected to CTL formation
in the presence of TFA-D in CD3CN or CH3CN and
formation of respective α-deuterated CTLs5a′/c′ were consistently characterized by NMR
and ESI-MS (Scheme 7A). The formation of α-dideuterated CTLs5a″–c″ was also observed in ESI-MS and
NMR spectral data. Further, extending the reaction time in the presence
of TFA-D from 30 min to 2 h to 12 h led to an increase in the formation
of α-dideuterated CTLs (5a″–c″). Next, the α-deuterated CTLs obtained in
the presence of TFA-D were then allowed to undergo reversible amidation.
The obtained Trag amides contain undeuterated amides 4a–c, monodeuterated amides 4a′–c′, and also dideuterated amides 4a″–c″. The presence of these three compounds was characterized by NMR
and ESI-MS. In 13C NMR, three representative peaks were
observed for some of the characteristic carbons, and the mass analysis
strongly supports NMR results (for representative spectral data, see Figures S17–S20).

spectral data showing the formation of α-deuterated CTL5b′ from 4b after treatment

spectra of CTL5b/b′ in CD3CN synthesized in the presence of TFA-D/TFA (synthesized from 4b); triplet showing the α-deuteration as α-CHD.

Scheme 7 α-Deuteration
Experiments
The similar deuteration
experiments were performed with Trag esters 3a–d and Trag acid 3c-OH in CD3CN in the presence of TFA-D
and studied by NMR. These studies confirmed the use of TFA-D results
in the formation of respective α-deuterated CTLs (5a′–d′ and 5a″–d″) along with undeuterated CTLs5a–d with TFA-D (Scheme 7B). These CTLs were then allowed to undergo amidation
with benzylamine. The mixture of deuterated (mono/dideuterated amides; 6a′–d′/6a″–d″) and
undeuterated amides 6a–d were isolated after amidation
(Scheme 7B). Most importantly,
the formation of α-deuterated 3-H+ (Figure S25) strongly supported
the slow conversion of 3-H+ to 5 which is due to occurrence of continuous reversible reaction
between the 3-H+ and 5 (Scheme 7B, highlighted
in the red box; for 1H NMR, see Figure S25).

For control experiments, N-troponyl
glycine (3aa) was also treated with TFA-D in CD3CN and studied
by NMR (Scheme 7C).
These experimental results revealed that the protonation of troponyl
carbonyl occurs, but the deuterium incorporation at α-CH2 was not observed (Figure S24).
These experiments suggest that the presence of an alkyl substituent
at glycinate nitrogen is necessary to enhance the acidity of glycinate
α-CH2 after protonation of troponyl carbonyl for
the formation of CTLs.

The formation of α-deuterated CTLs5a′–d′/5a″–d″ and
α-deuterated Trag amides (4a′–c′/4a″–c″/6a′–d′/6a″–d″) was consistently characterized. The incorporation of deuterium
clearly revealed the involvement of α-CH2 in amide
cleavage. However, it is very important to discuss the formation of
dideuterated CTLs5a″–d″ and Trag amides 4a″–c″/6a″–d″. This can be explained by the continuous occurrence of reversible
reaction between the CTLs5 and 3-H+, as presented in Scheme 7B (highlighted in the box).
The cleavage of CTLs into Trag esters
(3a–d) with excess EtOH nucleophile is already
described. Hence, liberated EtOH during the formation of CTLs from Trag ethyl esters is further reacting with CTL carbonyl carbon to give protonated Trag esters (3-H+). Again, the protonated Trag ester 3-H+ converts
into CTL5. The continuous occurrence
of reversible reactions leads to the exchange of α-CH2 protons with deuterium and results in formation of dideuterated
products.

To confirm this, time-dependent direct/reversible
amidation reactions
were performed by using TFA-D. The Trag ester 3c was treated with 7.0 equiv of TFA-D in CH3CN
and maintained at room temperature for 6 h and performed the amidation
reaction with benzylamine. The analysis of obtained Trag amides 6c/c′/c″ by ESI-MS revealed that
monodeuterated Trag amide 6c′ is more. When the time increased to 16 h, the dideuterated amide 6c″ is more (Figures S21 and S22).

Then, the same experiments were also performed with Trag amide 4b. The Trag amide 4b was treated with TFA-D in CH3CN and maintained
at room
temperature for 30 min. Then, the obtained CTLs were
allowed to undergo reversible amidation reaction. NMR and MS analysis
of isolated Trag amide revealed that only undeuterated
and monodeuterated amides were formed (Figure S20). Next, when the time was increased to 2 h, the obtained Trag amides contained relatively more monodeuterated amide 4a′ than 4a/a″, whereas Trag amides obtained after 12 h of treatment with TFA-D
contained relatively more dideuterated Trag amide 4a″ than 4a/4a′ (Figure S20). In the case of Trag amides,
the reversible reaction occurs because of the presence of water in
TFA-D and solvent. The conversion of Trag acid 3b-OH into CTL5b is already
described, and reversible reaction between the CTL5b and 3-H+ was
also observed using 1H NMR (Figure S25).

The increase in time leads to increase in the formation
of more
α-dideuterated 6c″/4a″ amides. These
experimental results strongly support the formation of dideuterated
products which is due to continuous reversible reactions between the CTL5 and 3-H+, which causes exchange of α-protons with deuterium.

Further, we attempted to trap the ketene intermediate via [2 +
2] cycloaddition with imines. In the literature, the ketene and imine
[2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions are reportedly known for the generation
of β-lactam.10d,12 Thus, we performed the Trag amide
(10/6a/6c) cleavage reaction with TFA/without TFA in
the presence of excess imine and studied their reaction mixture by
ESI-MS. For control studies, we performed and studied a similar reaction
without TFA. Their mass data are provided in the Supporting Information (Scheme S1; Page S118–122).
In the case of Trag amide 10, a new mass peak at ∼469.28
was noticed in the presence of excess imine (N-benzylidene-1-phenylmethanamine)
and TFA, while no such mass peak was appeared without TFA (Figures S178–S180). This mass peak is
matched with calculated mass of respective β-lactam from proposed
ketene and imine reactive species. The similar reactions were performed
with the other Trag amides (6a/6c) and
imine with TFA/without TFA. The formation of corresponding β-lactams
from respective amides is noticed only in the presence of TFA (Figures S180–S184). However, the formation
of CTL-charged species was more prominent as compared
to that of β-lactam. Hence, these studies strongly supported
the involvement of ketene as a reactive intermediate for the formation
of CTLs.

The above mentioned experimental results
strongly support the fact
that the formation of CTLs5 from 3/3-OH/4 occurs via a ketene intermediate. The detailed mechanism
is outlined in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Plausible reaction mechanism for the formation of mono/dideuterated CTLs and troponyl alkylglycinate amides.

It is important to discuss the possibility of occurrence
of CTL formation through an enolate intermediate
without the
formation of a ketene intermediate. The troponyl carbonyl oxygen is
not a strong nucleophile to attack at the enol intermediate directly
[the reported alkylation of troponyl carbonyl oxygen required a strong
electrophile donor like triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate (Meerwein’s
reagent)].11 In addition, troponyl carbonyl
oxygen gets protonated immediately after the addition of TFA which
further diminishes the nucleophilicity of troponyl carbonyl oxygen.
Thus, formation of CTLs through the enolate intermediate
is less probable. Therefore, the enol intermediate most probably is
converted into a ketene intermediate, and the ketene intermediate
rapidly reacts with troponyl carbonyl oxygen to give CTLs.

To summarize, the protonation of troponyl carbonyl is the
very
first step in initiating reaction, which results in generation of
the 3/4-H+ intermediate. Then,
the delocalization of the positive charge of the protonated amino
tropylium cation to N-atom leads to a remarkable increase in the acidity
of α-CH2. As a result, the formation of the enol
intermediate occurs, which most probably converts into a ketene intermediate.
This reactive ketene intermediate instantly undergoes nucleophilic
addition with troponyl carbonyl oxygen and produces CTL.

3 Conclusions
The
troponyl alkylglycinate ester/amide derivatives and N-troponyl amino acid ester derivatives were synthesized.
We have demonstrated the formation of CTLs5 from troponyl alkylglycinate acid/ester/amide derivatives
(3-OH, 3, 4) in the presence
of TFA/TFA-D in acetonitrile. The amidation of CTLs (5) with amine in the presence of a base (Et3N) is established. The reversible amidation reaction, that is, the
cleavage and reformation of the Trag-AA-OMe amide
bond via CTLs are elucidated. The direct amidation
of troponyl alkylglycinate acid/ester derivatives with amino acid/peptide
esters via CTLs was successfully demonstrated. Importantly,
the selective amidation of Trag ester with hydroxyl
amino acid esters was observed.

The reaction mechanism was probed
using deuterium to explore the
possible reactive intermediates of the reaction. The formation of
α-deuterated CTLs with TFA-D and the formation
of α-deuterated Trag amides upon their amidation
confirm the involvement of glycinate α-CH2 in the
formation of CTLs. Deuteration experimental results
strongly supported the formation of CTLs via a ketene
intermediate. The stability of the Trag-AA-OMe amide
bond under ester hydrolysis conditions and standard Fmoc removal conditions
is examined. The necessity of the alkyl substituent at glycinate nitrogen
for the formation of CTLs is examined. The troponyl
alkylglycinate amide bonds are stable under ester hydrolysis and Fmoc
removal conditions. Further, Trag amides are selectively
cleavable in the presence of other amide bonds. Thus, troponyl alkylglycinates
are applicable as orthogonal protecting groups for amine functionality.
To end, we have explored an unusual reactivity of troponyl alkylglycinate
amide/ester/acid derivatives, which are activated by the protonation
of troponyl carbonyl oxygen. To our knowledge, such kind of reactivity
of carboxylic acid derivatives and troponyl carbonyl under these acidic
conditions is not known in the literature.

A General Procedure for the
Syntheses of Troponyl
Alkylglycinate Monomers (3a–d)
To a solution
of 2-tosyloxy tropone (2, 2.4 gm, 8.677 mmol) in ethanol
(50 mL) was added N-octylglycinate (1, 5.5 gm, 25.581 mmol) and refluxed for 42 h. Reaction was monitored
by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture cooled
to room temperature and was concentrated under vacuum on a rota evaporator.
The reaction residue was redissolved in DCM (50 mL) and washed with
water three times by using a separatory funnel. The organic layers
were combined together and dried over Na2SO4 and then concentrated to dryness under vacuum. The concentrated
residue was subjected to purification on silica gel by column chromatographic
methods using ethyl acetate and hexanes as mobile phases. The desired
product was obtained as yellow viscous liquid (2.6 gm, 93%) and characterized
by 1H/13C NMR and MS spectrometric methods.

B General Procedure for the Syntheses of N-Troponyl Amino Acid Esters (3e, 3aa, 3ab)
2-tosyloxy tropone (500 mg, 1.81 mmol,
1.0 equiv) and 455 mg of glycine methyl ester hydrochloride (3.63
mmol, 2.0 equiv) were dissolved in ethanol, and to this, triethylamine
(1.5 mL, 10.09 mmol, 6.0 equiv) was added and stirred at room temperature
for 5 min. Then, the resultant reaction mixture is refluxed for 6–12
h. Completion of the reaction was judged by TLC. After completion
of the reaction, the reaction mixture cooled to room temperature,
and all volatiles were removed under reduced pressure to obtain the
crude product. To the obtained crude product, water was added and
extracted thrice with DCM. The combined organic layers were dried
over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude
product further purified through a silica gel column by using ethyl
acetate and hexanes as mobile phases. The pure product (320 mg, yield
= 84%) was obtained as a yellow solid.

C General
Procedure for the Ester Hydrolysis of
Monomers (3-OH)
Ethyl ester of the monomers
(3a–f) was dissolved in a 1:1 ratio of methanol
and a tetrahydrofuran mixture. To this, 2.0 equiv of sodium hydroxide
aqueous solution was added (sodium hydroxide was dissolved in a little
amount of water). Then, the reaction mixture is stirred for 20 min.
After completion of the reaction, all volatiles were evaporated under
reduced pressure. To the crude product, 1.0 N HCl was added and extracted
with DCM or ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were evaporated
in vacuo and dried completely. The obtained product was used for the
peptide synthesis without any further purification and characterization.
Note: 3b/c-OH was characterized by NMR and MS and then
employed for CTLs5b/c syntheses.

Note: In the case of hydrolysis of troponyl proline (Trpro) monomer 3f, after completion of the reaction, all
volatiles were evaporated. The crude residue was neutralized by using
1.0 N HCl to neutral pH (pH = 6.0–7.0). Then, water was evaporated.
To the obtained crude product, methanol was added and filtered to
remove NaCl salts. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum and
again redissolved in methanol and filtered. This process was done
three times to remove NaCl salts. Then, the methanol filtrate was
evaporated under reduced pressure, and the obtained product is allowed
to dry and be used for peptide syntheses.

D General
Procedure for the Ester Hydrolysis of
Trog Peptides (8-OH, 11-OH)
A troponyl
octylglycine-phenylalanine peptide (90 mg, 0.199 mmol, 1.0 equiv)
was dissolved in 1:1 methanol and tetrahydrofuran. To this solution,
16 mg of NaOH (0.398 mmol, 2.0 equiv) was added by dissolving it in
a little amount of water. The resultant mixture was allowed to stir
at room temperature for 10–20 min. The completion of reaction
was judged by TLC. After completion of the reaction mixture, all volatiles
were evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain the crude product.
To the crude product, DCM was added, and excess acetic acid (400 μL)
was added to neutralize sodium salts. After stirring for 2–3
min and transferring the solution into a separatory funnel, water
was added and extracted. The combined organic layers were allowed
to dry over sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to obtain
the pure product. If the presence of acetic acid was observed in the
pure product, more water was added (relative to organic solvent) again
and extracted with ethyl acetate. The obtained organic layer was dried
over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained
pure product (81 mg, yield 93%) was characterized by 1H
and 13C NMR in DMSO-d6 and
mass spectrometry.

E General Procedure for Peptide
Synthesis (4a/b/d/e/f)
Troponyl alkylglycine
(3b-OH, 1.5 gm, 5.15 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous
DMF (8.0 mL) under
nitrogen atmosphere and cooled to 0 °C. To this solution was
added EDC·HCl or diisopropyl carbodiimide and allowed to stir
for 10 min. Then, l-glycine methyl ester (970 mg, 1.5 equiv)
was neutralized with Et3N (3.0 equiv) in DMF (8.0 mL) and
added to the cold reaction mixture. The reaction was stirred at 0
°C for 30 min. Then, it was stirred at room temperature or 48
°C (in cases of less conversion, reaction temperature was raised
to 45–50 °C) overnight. Completion of the reaction was
judged by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was concentrated
under reduced pressure. A concentrated reaction residue was redissolved
in DCM and then washed with water thrice followed by saturated sodium
bicarbonate by following the extraction method. The washed organic
layers were combined together and dried over Na2SO4. Then, concentrated under reduced pressure, the obtained
crude product was purified through a silica gel column to obtain the
pure product 4b (1.2 gm, 65%). The obtained product was
characterized by 1H/13C NMR and MS.

F General Procedure for Syntheses of CTLs (5a–f) from Troponyl Alkylglycinate Amides (4a–f) and Reversible Amidation
Troponyl alkylglycinate
amides 4d (30 mg) were dissolved in CD3CN,
and to this, 6.0 equiv of TFA-D was added at room temperature and
allowed to stir. After 30 min, the formation of CTLs was confirmed by TLC and finally confirmed by 1H/13C NMR and ESI-MS methods. The obtained CTLs contain TFA salts of amino acids esters. Then, to convert the CTL into starting material (respective CTL), the same reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C and to this
was added 6.5 equiv of triethylamine at 0 °C with moderate speed,
and as a result, the reaction mixture turned to yellowish black. After
the addition of the triethylamine, the resultant mixture brought to
room temperature and allowed to stir at room temperature for 10 min.
Then, all volatiles were evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain
crude starting material. To this, crude product water was added and
extracted with ethyl acetate. Organic layers were combined together
and allowed to dry over sodium sulfate and then concentrated under
reduced pressure to obtain the crude product. The obtained crude product
was purified through silica gel column chromatography. The pure product
(21 mg) was isolated (70%).

The use of TFA-D produces undeuterated CTLs5a–c and α-deuetrated CTLs5a′–c′ under same
conditions in CD3CN/CH3CN. Further, reversible
amidation of those CTLs produces undeuterated amides 4a–c and α-deuetrated amides 4a′–c′/4a″–c″.

Note: Importantly, the increase in the time gap between the
amide
cleavage and reversible amidation causes more dideuteration, which
indicates that leaving the obtained CTLs and respective
amine salts in TFA-D for a long time (2–12 h) causes dideuteration
at the α-methylene group of the glycinate unit. This was studied
by mass and NMR. The 13C NMR spectra of Trag amides obtained after reversible amidation after treatment with
TFA-D have shown three sets of peaks (see the Supporting Information). For example, 4b peptide
was subjected to CTLs5b/b′ formation
in the presence of TFA-D. Then, the obtained CTLs (5b/b′) were employed for reversible amidation
with different time intervals (30 min, 2 h, 12 h; see Figure S20). The increase in the formation of
dideuterated amides 4a″–c″ was observed,
and if the time is 12 h, the α-monodeuterated amides 4a′–c′ and α-dideuterated amides 4a″–c″ were observed almost in an equal ratio in their NMR and mass spectra
(see Figures S17–S21). The α-dideuterated CTLs5a″–c″ were not observed
in 1H/13C NMR spectra, most probably because
of overlapping of peaks.

G General Procedure for the
Syntheses of CTLs (5a–f) from
Troponyl Alkylglycinate
Esters (3a–f), Acids (3-OH), and
Subsequent Amidation with Benzylamine (6a–E and 6a′–d′)
The troponyl alkylglycinate
ester 3c (65 mg, 0.173 mmol) was dissolved in CD3CN, and to this was added 7.0 equiv TFA or TFA-D. The resultant
mixture was maintained at room temperature for 6–8 h to obtain
respective CTLs (5) and the protonated
form of starting material. After 6–8 h, to the same reaction
mixture, benzylamine (0.208 mmol, 23 μL) was added, and the
resultant mixture allowed to stir and cooled to 0 °C, and to
this was added 6.5–8.5 equiv of triethylamine at 0 °C
by using a syringe with moderate speed (for neutralization, equal
amount of triethylamine with respect to TFA was added). After the
addition of triethylamine, the reaction mixture turned to yellowish
black. This reaction mixture is allowed to stir for 10 min at room
temperature. Completion of reaction was judged by TLC. After completion
of the reaction, all volatiles were evaporated under reduced pressure
to obtain the crude product. To the crude product, water was added
and extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers
were allowed to dry over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced
pressure. The obtained crude residue was subjected to purification
through silica gel column chromatography by using ethyl acetate and
hexanes as mobile phases. 6c (52 mg) as the pure product
was obtained (70%).

To obtain the α-deuterated peptides 6a′–d′, the same procedure was followed
and TFA-D was used instead of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA-H).

H General Procedure for the Direct Amidation of
Troponyl Alkylglycinates 3b/c with Amino Acid Ester Hydrochlorides
and Peptides Trifluoroacetate Salts (4c/7–15)
Troponyl alkylglycinate ester 3b (290 mg, 0.927 mmol)
was dissolved in 3.5 mL of anhydrous CH3CN and to this
was added 7.0 equiv TFA (6.489 mmol, 496 μL). The resultant
mixture was left at room temperature for 6–8 h to obtain respective CTL5b. Then, the same reaction mixture was
added to Boc-deprotected and fully dried diphenylalanine trifluoroacetate
peptide salt (1.2 equiv H3N+-Phe-Phe-OMe) in
a round-bottom flask. The resultant mixture was allowed to stir at
room temperature for complete dissolution of the peptide salt. The
resultant mixture was cooled to 0 °C and to this was added 8.5
equiv (1.099 mL) of triethylamine at 0 °C by using a syringe
with moderate speed under stirring. After the addition of triethylamine,
the reaction mixture turned to yellowish black, and the reaction mixture
was brought to room temperature and allowed to stir for 5–10
min at room temperature. Completion of reaction was judged by TLC.
After completion of the reaction, all volatiles were evaporated under
reduced pressure to obtain the crude product. To the crude product,
water was added and extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The combined
organic layers were allowed to dry over sodium sulfate and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The obtained crude residue was subjected for
purification through silica gel column chromatography by using ethyl
acetate and hexanes as mobile phases. The pure product (265 mg, condition
A, yield = 48%) was isolated as yellowish thick liquid. The rest of
the reactions were performed in 0.32–0.34 mmol scale in 1.0–1.3
mL CH3CN. Condition A: Trog-OEt = 1.0
equiv and amine = 1.2 equiv, and isolated yields are with respect
to Trog-OEt. Condition B: Trog = 2.0 equiv and amine
= 1.0 equiv, and isolated yields are with respect to amine.

Note: Reaction was performed in several possible ways such as the
following: (1) solid amino acid/peptide ester was directly added to
the freshly prepared respective CTLs5b solution in acetonitrile (containing TFA) and stirred well to ensure
complete dissolution of amino acid or peptide ester salts. Then, it
was cooled to 0 °C (2 min) and neutralized with an equal amount
of triethylamine under stirring at 0 °C (the required Et3N was calculated by considering the added TFA and amino acid
ester salts); (2) when the amino acid ester hydrochlorides (valine
methyl ester or phenylalanine methyl ester or tyrosine methyl ester
or 4-hydroxyproline methyl ester) were used as amines, these amine
salts were first dissolved in a minimum amount of acetonitrile and
neutralized with 1.5 equiv of Et3N. To the resultant solution,
freshly prepared CTL5b solution in
acetonitrile (containing TFA) was added and immediately cooled to
0 °C under vigorous stirring and neutralized with Et3N with moderate speed to obtain Trog amides.

I Reversible Amidation Reaction Monitoring by 1H/13C NMR Experiments in CD3CN
Troponyl alkylglycinate
peptides (4a–f) were
dissolved in CD3CN and characterized by 1H/13C NMR. To the same sample, 6.0 equiv of TFA was added and
characterized by 1H/13C NMR again. After the
addition of TFA to the sample, as envisioned, both 1H/13C NMR spectra are completely changed, and the characteristic
tropone carbonyl peak at ∼δ 180–183.0 ppm was
disappeared. These spectra contain TFA peaks. Then, again to the same
sample in the NMR tube, 6.5 equiv of triethylamine was added at room
temperature and stirred well. This sample was also characterized by 1H/13C NMR spectra. Both 1H/13C NMR spectra reappeared after neutralization (see Figure S1). Finally, the reaction mixture was evaporated under
reduced pressure. To the crude product, water was added and extracted
with ethyl acetate twice. The obtained organic layers were combined
together and dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced
pressure. The obtained crude product after extraction was purified
through silica gel column chromatography.

J Reaction
Monitoring by NMR and Conversion of
Troponyl Alkylglycinate Esters 3/3-OH into CTLs5
Troponyl alkylglycinate esters were dissolved
in CD3CN, and to this solution, 6.0–8.0 equiv of
TFA (TFA-H/TFA-D) was added. After 6 h, 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded.

Troponyl alkylglycinate acids
(3/c-OH) were dissolved in CD3CN, and to this
solution, 6.0 equiv of TFA (TFA-H/TFA-D) was added. After 2 h, 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded.

K Stability of the Trag Amide Bond under Standard
Fmoc Removal Conditions (8/14)
Trog-Hyp-OMe
(14) peptide (62 mg, 0.14 mmol) was taken in a round-bottom
flask and treated with 20.0% piperidine in DMF (1.0 mL) at room temperature
for 4 h. Reaction was monitored by TLC. After 4 h, the reaction mixture
was analyzed by ESI-MS. The TLC monitoring and ESI-MS experiments
revealed that the Trag amide bond is stable under these conditions.
The same reaction was performed with 36 mg of the Trag-Phe-Phe-OMe
peptide (8) and analyzed by ESI-MS.

4.2 Analytical Data
All CTLs were synthesized by following
the general procedures F and G from respective
troponyl alkylglycinate amides (4a–f) and acid
derivatives 3b/c-OH in the presence of TFA/TFA-D. The
NMR (1H/13C/13CDEPT135) spectra of CTLs (5a/a′, 5c′, 5d, 5e) synthesized from amides 4a–e contain glycine methyl ester peaks and TFA peaks,
whereas the NMR spectra of CTLs (5b/b′ and 5c) synthesized from 3-OH contain
TFA peaks and protonated 3-OH peaks.

The α-deuterated amides 4a′–c′ and 6a′–d′ contain three compounds
such as undeuterated (4a), monodeuterated (4a′), and dideuterated (4a″) products which are
characterized by NMR and MS. In 13C NMR, they have shown
three sets of peaks. Hence, all observed chemical shift values are
listed in 13C NMR data. This was further observed in their
mass spectral data. 1H NMR peaks appeared at the same chemical
shifts for all three compounds, other than α-CH2 and
α-CHD.
