Influenza
viruses (IV) cause substantial morbidity and mortality
through routine seasonal spread and epidemics. A novel series of butenolides
were discovered to be able to inhibit influenza H1N1 activity in vitro,
and the SAR for anti-influenza activity was investigated. By optimization
of the hit compound, compound 37 was obtained with an
EC50 of 6.7 μM against influenza A virus H1N1 as
an inhibitor of NA and with low cytotoxicity on MDCK cells. Also,
it can inhibit the expression of the influenza A virus gene in the
lung of SPF KM mice to show antivirus activity in vivo. These results
suggested that compound 37 could inhibit the influenza
A virus H1N1 via targeting NA.

1 Introduction
Influenza
viruses (IV) cause substantial morbidity and mortality
through routine seasonal spread and epidemics.1,2 At
present, the first-line drugs recommended for antiflu treatment are
NA inhibitors.3−5 However, the antiviral drugs have met several limitations
because of the high frequency of emerging resistant variants and undesirable
toxic side effects.6,7 Therefore, there is a continuous
and urgent need to develop novel and effective drugs to overcome the
limitations of the existing antiviral agents.

Here, we reported
a novel series of butenolides with anti-influenza
activity H1N1 in vitro and in vivo. Among all synthetic compounds,
compound 37 showed the most significant antivirus activity
with an EC50 of 6.7 μM as an inhibitor of NA from
influenza A virus H1N1with low cytotoxic on MDCK cells. The antiviral
activity of compound 37 was also verified in vivo. The
viral loads in lung tissues of the groups treated by compound 37 were lower than that of the model group by qRT-PCR analysis.

The γ-butenolide is a ubiquitous structural component present
in a plethora of naturally occurring compounds (Figure 1).8 Some of them
showed high efficiency against viruses including HBV, HCV, BVDV, and
anti-influenza virus activities such as compound I.9−11 In our preliminary research, we focused on the synthesis and bioactive
research of butenolide derivatives and found that compound II showed anti-BVDV activity. Based on the work above, screening of
these compounds via an in-house compound library showed the potency
of a novel butenolide (25) for inhibiting influenza A
virus H1N1 with an IC50 of 61 μM. With compound 25 as a hit compound, a series of novel butenolide derivatives
were designed and synthesized to study the SAR by modification at
the α-, β-, and γ-carbons of carbonyl on butenolide.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Syntheses of Target Compounds
First,
compounds 22–30 were designed and
synthesized to investigate the contribution to activity of substitution
on the phenyl group at the α-carbon of butenolide. The syntheses
of compounds 22–30 were shown in Scheme 1. The substituted
phenyl acetic acids (1) were treated with ethyl chloroacetate
(2) to afford the acyclic ester (3), which
then underwent an intramolecular cyclization to afford the 2-phenyl-3-hydroxybutenolides
(4–12). Compounds 4–12 were then converted to their 4-methoxy derivatives 13–21 by a methylation reaction. Compounds 13–21 were used to prepare 2-phenyl-3,4-dimethoxy-4-methylbutenolides
(22–30) through condensation with
paraformaldehyde in methanol in the presence of CH3ONa.

Regents and conditions: (a) (Et)3N, THF, 75 °C, and >90%; (b) t-BuOK,

0 °C to room temperature, and 80–90%; (c) Me2SO4, K2CO3, Acetone, and 70–80%;
and (d) (CH2O)n, CH3ONa, CH3OH, 75 °C, and 45–50%.

Compounds 37–41 were
designed
and synthesized to compare the heterocyclic and benzylamine substitution
with methoxy at the β-carbon (Scheme 2). Compound 9 was treated with
oxalyl chloride in DMF and DCM to yield compound 31,
which was used to prepare compounds 32–36 by the reaction with a morpholine analogous or benzylamine. Compounds 36–41 were obtained by refluxing with
paraformaldehyde in the presence of NaOCH3 in methanol.

and (c) (CH2O)n, CH3ONa, CH3OH, 75 °C, and 30–40%.

Keeping the groups on α- and β-carbons, compounds 45–48 were designed to investigate the
phenyl hydroxymethyl substitution contribution for their antivirus
activity. The key mediate 44 was synthesized by the reaction
with ethyl 2-bromopropanoate and compound 1d as raw materials
(Scheme 3). It was
treated with various aryl aldehydes to give compounds 45–48.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Compounds 45–48
Regents and conditions:
(a) (Et)3N, THF, and 75 °C;
(b) t-BuOK, DMF, from 0
°C to room temperature, and 80–90% for two steps; (c)
Me2SO4, K2CO3, Acetone,
and 70–80%; and (d) aryl aldehyde, CH3ONa, CH3OH, and 40–50%.

Based on the
primary screening of the synthetic compounds for influenza
A H1N1, compound 37 showed an improved antivirus activity.
Thus, compounds 57–60 were designed
and prepared to evaluate the contribution of various substitutions
such as chlorine, fluorin, and methyl groups on the phenyl at the
α-carbon to compare with compound 37. They were
synthesized by the similar reactions used for the preparation of compound 37 (Scheme 4). Among them, compound 59 was characterized by an X-ray
diffraction analysis (CCDC 1844567).

2.2 Synthetic Compounds and
their Anti-Influenza
A Virus H1N1 Activity In Vitro
All the synthetic compounds
were evaluated by anti-influenza A H1N1 virus activity in MDCK cell
(Table 1). A better
antivirus activity was found on compounds 22, 23, 27, 28, and 30 than the
hit compound 25 with an EC50 of 7.5 ±
0.9 to 33.4 ± 1.0 μM. Compounds 27 and 28 with m-F and p-methoxyl
phenyl groups have a similar level EC50 of 7.5 and 9.4
μM. Compounds 36–40 with p-methoxyl phenyl groups at α-carbon and amino groups
at the β position showed effective antiviral activity. Among
them, compound 37 was the best one. However, compounds 45–48 with the phenyl hydroxymethyl substitution
at the γ-carbon showed almost no antivirus activity. Compounds 57–60 designed according to compound 37 showed efficient antiviral activity with an EC50 of 14.1 ± 2.5 to 34.7 ± 5.9 μM, although no compound
was better than compound 37.

Based on the results above,
the SAR is analyzed and suggests that
the substitution of halogen and methoxy on the phenyl group at the
α-carbon of carbonyl on butenolide are beneficial to antivirus
activity for compounds 22–30. Specially,
compounds 27 and 28 with m-F and p-methoxyl phenyl groups are better than
others. The amino groups at the β-carbon of the carbonyl group
contribute to the antivirus activity for compounds 37–41. Among them, compound 37 with
morpholine substitution is the best one. The methoxy at the γ-carbon
of the carbonyl group showed an important role for the antivirus of
the novel butenolides. Introduction of phenyl hydroxymethyl groups
such as compounds 45–48 led to the
loss of antivirus activity.

2.3 Inhibition of Compound 37 against
NA from Influenza A Virus H1N1
A fluorescence-based NA inhibition
assay was used to determine whether the compounds have the abilities
to suppress NA activity. The inhibition rate of compound 37 was increased in a dose-dependent manner, closely to the neuraminidase
inhibitors of oseltamivir in Figure 2. It revealed that compound 37 could decrease
neuraminidase activity and inhibit the virus as a novel NA inhibitor.

2.4 Cytotoxicity and Antiviral
Activity of Compound 37 on MDCK Cells
Cytotoxicity
and antiviral activity
of compound 37 on MDCK cells were shown in Figure 3. Compound 37 had
less cytotoxicity on MDCK cells, and there were low cytotoxic effect
on the viability of MDCK cells even at a concentration of 800 μM
(Figure 3A). The inhibition
on infected MDCK cells was in dose-dependent (Figure 3B). Among the synthetic compounds, compound 37 showed better antivirus activity than positive control
ribavirin. These results suggest that the compound 37 had a better antiviral activity on MDCK cells.

2.5 Anti-Influenza A Virus H1N1 Activity of Compound 37 In Vivo
Thus, compound 37 was chosen
to test the anti-influenza A virus activity on SPF KM mice. As shown
in Figure 4, the body
temperature was fluctuated at 36.5 °C, and the body weight was
increased in all groups before virus infection. Whereas, the body
temperature and body weight in the virus group were decreased after
virus infection from 4 to 8 days. Meanwhile, the body temperatures
treated with compound 37 was closed to the control groups.
The body weights of the high-dose group treated by compound 37 kept increasing and were closely to the control group.

Figure 4 Changes
in body temperature and body weight of mice (n =
8).

As shown in Figure 5, no lesion (pink color) could be observed
in the lung of mice without
the treatment of virus (Figure 5A). However, obvious lesion (dark red) was found, and the
volume of the lung was increased in the virus group (Figure 5B). Basically, less lesion
were found in the groups of compound 37 compared to the
virus control (Figure 5C,D). The antiviral efficacy was also confirmed microscopically by
hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) staining. No inflammation or pathological
changes of the lung was observed in the normal control group. Severe
lung hyperemia, lesions, and alveolar walls thickened were observed
in the virus group. Meanwhile, many inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes,
neutrophils, and macrophages were also filled in alveolar spaces of
the virus group. However, less lung inflammation and lesions were
observed in the groups of compound 37. These data reveal
that compound 37 had the antiviral effect against H1N1.

were sectioned for H&E staining, and images were taken at ×200
magnification. (A) Control, (B) virus, (C) compound 37 (200 mg/kg), and (D) compound 37 (50 mg/kg).

The viral loads of normal , virus , treatment groups
were analyzed
by a quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in the lung tissue. Lower
viral loads were detected in the group treated by compound 37 compared to the virus group (Figure 6). The results suggest that compound 37 was able to decrease the virus load in the lung tissue.

8). *P < 0.05 compared to virus.

Based on the natural butenolide skeleton and screening of
an in-house
compound library, compound 37 as an antiviral agent was
obtained by optimization of the hit compound. It could inhibit the
activity of influenza A virus H1N1 in vitro and in vivo. Also, it
could reduce the activity of NA. These results suggest that compound 37 could inhibit the H1N1 via suppressing the virus target
of NA.
