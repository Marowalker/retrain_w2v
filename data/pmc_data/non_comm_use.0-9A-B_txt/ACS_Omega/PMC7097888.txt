Functionalized
mesoporous silicas are an emerging kind of adsorbents
for the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Breaking the
limitations of traditional mesoporous silica, in this study, porous
silica nanocapsules (PSNs) functionalized with phenyl and n-octyl groups (named as p-PSN and n-PSN, respectively) were developed for the first time.
Under dry conditions, the PSNs exhibited highest dynamic adsorption
capacity and desorption efficiency among the ever-reported typical
adsorbents (i.e., SBA-15, KIT-6, silicalite-1, and activated carbon).
Under wet conditions, the functionalized PSNs made up the defects
of pure PSNs, displaying excellent hydrophobicity. The QWET for n-PSN and p-PSN
increased by 44 and 76%, respectively, as compared with that of pure
PSNs in 50% relative humidity. The Henry constant of static adsorption
demonstrated that p-PSN had a better capture ability
for toluene, which was owing to the π-interaction between the
phenyl groups and the toluene molecules. In addition, p-PSN showed considerable stability after six consecutive dynamic
adsorption–desorption cycles in 50% relative humidity.

1 Introduction
With
rapid industrial development, the heavy emission of waste
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) results in serious environmental
hazards, such as chemical smog, secondary organic aerosol, and formation
of photochemical ozone.1,2 Many technologies have been applied
for controlling VOC emission, such as membrane separation,3,4 photocatalytic oxidation,5 adsorption,6,7 and combustion (including thermal incineration2 and catalytic combustion8,9). Among these
techniques, combustion is a widely used technology to completely convert
VOCs into carbon dioxide and water without secondary pollution. However,
for treating the emission of low-concentrated VOCs in real conditions,
combustion alone causes enormous loss of energy.10 Therefore, hybrid technologies in combination with adsorptive
concentration and combustion are found effective to solve this problem.
An adsorptive concentration system can concentrate the low-concentrated
VOCs using adsorption, followed by thermal desorption.11 For quasi-continuous adsorption–desorption
operation, the crucial part of such system is the adsorbent, which
requires a high VOC adsorption capacity, rapid desorption rate, and
relatively low desorption temperature. Additionally, humid gas is
ubiquitous in the VOC stream; thus, in order to improve the applicability,
an adsorbent with high hydrophobic property needs to be urgently developed.12

Activated carbon (AC) has been conventionally
selected as a gas
adsorbent owing to its high adsorption capacity with low cost.2,13,14 Unfortunately, several serious
drawbacks limited its wide applications, mainly including poor thermal
stability and high desorption temperature in regeneration.15,16 Hence, other adsorbents such as zeolites and mesoporous silica are
desired to replace it. Among zeolites, aluminum-free MFI-type silicalite-1
is widely used owning to its high hydrophobic property and thermal
stability.17 However, microporous structures
hinder diffusion of molecules in both adsorption and desorption.17,18 Mesoporous silicas outperform zeolites because of their mesoporous
channels, improving the mass transferring performance. In previous
studies, among ordered mesoporous silicas, three-dimensional (3-D)
mesostructured materials were found to be better than one-dimensional
mesostructured materials, that is, KIT-6 showed a better adsorption
performance than either SBA-15 or MCM-41.19 Thus, further research has always paid more attention on KIT-6.20 In order to improve the adsorption ability in
humid environments, tailored surface modification was required to
enhance the hydrophobicity. Dou et al.19 prepared four-ordered mesoporous silicas grafted with phenyl groups.
The phenyl-grafted KIT-6 offered the best adsorption of toluene under
less wet conditions. Liu et al.21 synthesized
phenyl-KIT-6 by a cocondensation one-step method, and they exhibited
high adsorption capacity of toluene in a high humidity environment.
Liu et al.22 further synthesized triphenyl-grafted
KIT-6 and phenyl-grafted KIT-6, exhibiting different adsorption performances
because of the surface area and exposed organic groups. From all of
the above research studies, it can be concluded that surface modification
with organic groups for silica-based materials could enhance the adsorption
performance under wet conditions, improving the applicability. Nevertheless,
these improvements were only limited into the field of KIT-6. For
industrial applications, there are still some issues that inherent
in KIT-6, such as high cost of manufacturing and poor adsorption capacity
compared with commercial AC. Consequently, for making up the above
defects of KIT-6-based materials, there is a need of identifying a
desirable new functionalized silica-based adsorbent that is economically
viable and has excellent adsorption performance. However, as far as
we know, a new kind of functionalized silica-based adsorbent for VOC
adsorption has rarely been investigated in recent research studies.

Based on the literature review, a bimodal pore system was essential
for adsorption of VOCs.23 We speculated
that a hollow structure combined with sufficient small mesopores was
an advanced form of a bimodal pore system. Moreover, for further practical
applications, it was expected that this new silica-based mesoporous
adsorbent should be equipped with a hydrophobic surface. Herein, in
the present study, we developed for the first time hollow-structured
porous silica nanocapsules (PSNs) functionalized with phenyl and n-octyl groups, which possessed many mesopores and a functional
hydrophobic surface. Toluene was selected as a probe VOC molecule,
and a continuous-flow adsorption method was established to evaluate
the adsorption performance. The dynamic adsorption–desorption
behaviors for PSNs were systematically evaluated and compared with
those of other typical adsorbents (silicalite-1, KIT-6, SBA-15, and
AC). The hydrophobicity of PSN-based materials was investigated under
different relative humidities (11–50% RH) in the test conditions.
The aim of this study was to design an adsorbent possessing superior
VOC adsorption capacity and high desorption efficiency under both
dry and wet conditions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Adsorbent Characterization
The PSN-based
materials were synthesized via a dynamic self-assembly method by using
diethyl ether as the cosolvent. Transmission electron microcopy (TEM)
analysis was conducted to show the morphology and structure of the
adsorbents. All the particles showed the same spherical shapes with
inner cavities as shown in Figure 1a,b, which suggested a successful synthesis of hollow
nanospheres. Figure 1c,d illustrated that the hollow structure was maintained after the
organic groups were grafted onto the silica surface. The mean diameter
of these spherical nanocapsules was estimated between 150 and 200
nm. According to the high-magnification TEM images, each nanocapsule
presented a shell wall of around 15 nm. Interestingly, many small
mesopores of 2–4 nm were observed on the wall of the nanocapsules.
Pleats consisting of channel-like mesopores were found on the nanocapsules,
which were caused by simultaneous self-assembly of condensed silica
and heterogeneous gasification of diethyl ether.24

The morphologies of other
silica adsorbents for comparison were
also analyzed. As shown in Figure 2a, silicalite-1 consisted of nanoparticles with an
average diameter of 70 nm. The hexagonally ordered pores of SBA-15
can be distinguished in Figure 2b, and uniformly straight two-dimensional channels were also
observed. Likewise, as shown in Figure 2c, KIT-6 exhibited a 3-D cubic structure with ordered
bimodal mesopores.

Figure 2 TEM images of other silica adsorbents: silicalite-1 (a),
SBA-15
(b), and KIT-6 (c).

The nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms of PSN-based materials
are shown in Figure 3. According to the IUPAC nomenclature,25 both pure PSNs and functionalized PSN materials exhibited typical
type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops, indicating the presence
of slit-shaped pores. The initial rapid increase of adsorbed N2 at relatively low pressure (P/P0 < 0.1) was caused by the micropores on the wall.
Interestingly, no adsorption plateau was observed when the relative
pressure was approaching 1.0, suggesting that the adsorbents had large
mesopores,26 which was attributed to the
hollow structure, consistent with the direct observation of TEM. The
results of nitrogen adsorption were summarized in Table 1. With the incorporation of
phenyl and n-octyl groups, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of p-PSN and n-PSN reduced by 13.1 and 19.8%, respectively, while the obvious decrease
of total pore volume was 68.1 and 65.4%, respectively. This phenomenon
was caused by grafting of organic groups on the surface. As expected,
functionalized organic groups would fill part of the hollow cavity.
The pore distribution of all PSN-based materials showed a similar
distribution, which agreed well with the TEM result, indicating the
adsorption sites on the wall preserved after functionalized with organic
groups.

The incorporation of phenyl and n-octyl groups into the PSN
frameworks was investigated
by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR). As shown in Figure 4, after grafting with organic
groups, several new peaks appeared in the spectra compared with pure
PSNs. Notably, p-PSN showed two peaks at 698 and
740 cm–1, which were assigned to the benzene rings.27,28 The peaks at 2974, 2933—, and 2886 cm–1 were attributed to the −CH3 and −CH2– overlap stretching vibration of the n-octyl groups, while as for p-PSNs, the intensities
of these peaks decreased because of less C–H bonds on the phenyl
groups.29,30 The broad peaks at 3420 cm–1 could be assigned to the −OH stretching vibration, which
exhibited lower intensity, indicating that most of hydroxyl groups
were grafted by organic groups.27

of PSNs, p-PSN, and n-PSN.

The thermogravimetry (TG)/derivative thermogravimetry
(DTG) curves
obtained from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments are
shown in Figure 5. p-PSN and n-PSN displayed an increasing
weight loss compared with PSNs. A significant peak at temperature
lower than 200 °C appeared in the DTG curves, which is attributed
to the loss of surface-adsorbed water.27 As compared with the amount of adsorbed water, p-PSN (8.39%) and n-PSN (7.54%) have lesser amount
than PSNs (10.87%), indicating that functionalized PSNs exhibited
stronger surface hydrophobicity. Compared with PSNs, p-PSN and n-PSN showed additional peaks on the DTG
curves in the range of 500–700 and 230–600 °C,
respectively, which were attributed to the decomposition of phenyl
groups and n-octyl groups, respectively. Moreover,
calculating from the weight loss data, the amount of grafting organic
groups for p-PSN and n-PSN was 6.67%
(phenyl groups) and 7.32% (n-octyl groups), respectively.

lines) and DTG (dashed lines) of the PSNs, p-PSN,
and n-PSN.

Above all, the PSN materials consisting of hollow spheres were
fabricated, and organic groups were incorporated on the surface of
the PSNs successfully. Our first priority was to investigate the adsorption
performance of pure PSNs and compare with other adsorbents to confirm
the superiority of these kinds of hollow-structured materials.

2.2 Dry Condition Adsorption–Desorption
Behavior of Pure Silicas
To evaluate the dynamic adsorption
performance of pure PSNs, we adopted the breakthrough measurements31 of low-concentrated toluene vapor. The obtained
experimental breakthrough curves and the curves simulated with the
Yoon–Nelson model are shown in Figure 6. Important adsorption parameters such as
the first adsorption capacity (QDRY) and
the first breakthrough time (tB, C/C0 = 0.05) are summarized
in Table 2. Under dry
conditions, compared with traditional silica adsorbents and AC, PSNs
exhibited excellent adsorption ability. The first adsorption capacity
decreased in the order of PSNs (2.10 mmol g–1) >
AC (1.78 mmol g–1) > silicalite-1 (1.48 mmol
g–1) > KIT-6 (1.34 mmol g–1) > SBA-15
(1.10 mmol g–1). It was important to point out that
the first adsorption capacity of PSNs increased by 91, 57, and 42%
as compared with that of SBA-15, KIT-6, and silicalite-1 (typical
silica materials for adsorption), respectively. Furthermore, the first
adsorption capacities of PSNs surpassed that of AC, at around 18%,
overcoming the low capacity disadvantage of mesoporous silicas. As
a more detailed comparison, Tables S1 and S2 listed the adsorption capacities of other reported adsorbents. As
we can see, PSNs exhibited the maximal adsorption capacity among silica-based
adsorbents, and the capacity was comparable to several carbon-based
materials. The half-life τ obtained from the Y–N model
also represented the adsorption ability, and a greater τ demonstrated
a superior adsorption capacity. The τ of PSNs (42.79 min) was
higher than those of silicalite-1 (30.52 min), KIT-6 (27.75 min),
SBA-15 (22.25 min), and AC (36.48 min), in accordance with the order
of the actual adsorption capacity.

adsorbents under dry condition.

In general, the rate
constant value k represented
the diffusion and mass-transfer characteristic of toluene in the fixed
bed. Among pure silica materials, a higher k represented
a quicker breakthrough process, indicating a lower diffusion resistance.32 KIT-6 showed the highest k value
of 1.3387 min–1, indicating the least resistance
in the diffusion process. SBA-15 also showed a high k value of 1.2668 min–1, indicating that the ordered
mesoporous silica adsorbents enhanced the mass transfer in the adsorption
process. In particular, the breakthrough time of silicalite-1 was
the longest, corresponding to a k value of 0.4642
min–1, demonstrating the limited diffusion in microporous
silica adsorbents. Compared with these three kinds of silica materials,
the diffusion resistance of PSNs was between those of silicalite-1
and SBA-15, which was most likely caused by the hollow structure.

As previously reported by Kosuge,23 the
VOC molecules were more likely to be adsorbed into small mesopores
(2.1 nm in size). For mesoporous adsorbents, the adsorption process
was controlled by the diffusion of VOC molecules into the pore channels
of the adsorbents. KIT-6 offered better adsorption performance than
SBA-15 because of its bicontinuous cubic pore structure and large
mesopores.19 The cubic mesopore structure
was favorable to diffusion of toluene molecules, leading to higher
accessibility of mesopores. As for PSNs, the crackles on the shell
offered channels for VOC molecules to enter the space underneath.
Additionally, the spherical hollow structure created 3-D interconnected
channels, providing better accessibility for the VOC molecules through
the micropores and small mesopores on the shell.33 The intrinsic pore connection between the mesopore channels
and the micropores was the key factor in VOC adsorption.23 In other words, the hollow structure dramatically
enhanced the utilization efficiency of the adsorption sites in the
shell. This unique structure could be responsible for the larger adsorption
capacity of toluene.34,35

In order to further investigate
the desorption efficiency, all
of the adsorbents were regenerated by thermal treatment (80 °C).
The desorption curves (shown in Figure 7) show a sharp increase at the beginning of the desorption
process. High-concentration toluene streams came out, and over time,
the outlet toluene concentration gradually decreased and the value
of Qdesorption increased relatively gently.
In Table 3, the desorption
performance on various adsorbents were compared in terms of E5 (the desorption efficiency in the first 5
min) and the desorption ratio. A higher E5 typically indicated a better VOCs concentrated process. The desorption
efficiency of PSNs (6.27 mmol s–1 g–1) was far more than those of the other adsorbents. This difference
was caused by the pore structure and adsorption capacity simultaneously.
For ordered mesoporous materials such as KIT-6 and SBA-15, after thermal
treatment, the desorbed toluene quickly passed through the ordered
channels and finally leaving the adsorption bed. However, the amount
of desorbed toluene was limited because of the low adsorption capacity, and that did not work for an effective
concentrated process. The PSN-based materials did not contain any
ordered mesopores, and thus, the excellent desorption performance
was due to the unique hollow structure. All adsorption sites in the
spherical shell were easily exposed to the high-temperature carrier
gas, and then numerous toluene molecules desorbed into the hollow
or interstitial hole, promoting the transport diffusion and boosting
the process of concentration. As to silicalite-1 and AC, the values
of E5 and the desorption rate were very
low. The desorption curves showed that the toluene adsorbed by silicalite-1
and AC desorbed very slowly in the initial stage, and it took a much
longer time for them to reach a steady state, suggesting that the
narrow micropores hindered the regeneration process.

desorption amount of all the adsorbents under

The adsorption capacities of
all adsorbents are depicted in Figure 8. PSNs, SBA-15, and
KIT-6 remained almost unchanged after six cycles. The adsorption capacity
of AC decreased dramatically in the second adsorption cycle, like
the result reported by Wang,36 indicating
that the toluene molecules adsorbed in the micropores of AC were difficult
to be desorbed under mild conditions (80 °C). The adsorption
capacity of all adsorbents remained the same after the second-regeneration
process.

under dry condition.

2.3 Wet Condition
Adsorption Behavior of PSN-Based
Materials
As expected, pure PSNs exhibited the best adsorption
performance. However, hydrophilic silicon hydroxyl groups on the surface
restricted the application under wet conditions. In this study, we
fabricated p-PSN and n-PSN with
stable hydrophobic surface by replacing the silicon hydroxyl groups
with phenyl and n-octyl groups, respectively. As
discussed before, after functionalization, the uniform hollow structure
was preserved, which was beneficial to adsorption. Thus, combined
with the results of physicochemical techniques, functionalized PSNs
may possess excellent adsorption performance under wet conditions.

To investigate the effects of the grafted hydrophobic surface,
the PSN-based materials were tested under different RHs. As can be
seen from Figure 9,
it was noted that the obtained experimental breakthrough curves of
PSNs under 50% RH was quite different from that under dry conditions.
The phenomenon of roll-up (C/C0 > 1) appeared in the breakthrough curves of PSNs as is
mentioned
in previous reports.13,21 Water and toluene molecules competed
for adsorption at the active sites. Part of adsorbed toluene molecules
were replaced by water vapor and eventually the outlet concentration
of toluene increased. The good news was that this phenomenon disappeared
in the breakthrough curves of p-PSN and n-PSN.

Figure 9 Toluene breakthrough curves on PSN-based materials under 50% RH.

The breakthrough times (tB) acquired
from the breakthrough curves under different RHs are listed in Table 4. The corresponding
breakthrough curves are provided in the Supporting Information. As expected, the tB values of p-PSN and n-PSN surpassed
those of pure PSNs under 11 and 27% RH, respectively, in spite of
comparatively lower pore volume and surface area of functionalization.
This phenomenon was attributed to the abundance of grafted organic
groups, indicating that phenyl and n-octyl groups
might resist to water vapor. Therefore, the organic groups on the
surface were a crucial factor to improve the hydrophobicity. A comparison
of the adsorption capacity under different wet conditions (QWET) is shown in Figure 10. The values of QWET decreased with increasing RH, a sharper decline always illustrated
its poor hydrophobicity. The QWET of pure
mesoporous silica adsorbents (PSNs and KIT-6) decreased more rapid
with RH compared with functionalized PSNs, revealing significantly
poor humidity tolerance. The adsorption capacities under different
conditions of PSNs were still better than those of KIT-6. In contrast,
the QWET of p-PSN and n-PSN decreased gradually, and the values of QWET for p-PSN and n-PSN
increased up to 1.44–1.76 times than that of the pure PSNs
in 50% RH, demonstrating that p-PSN and n-PSN possessed excellent hydrophobicity under high wet condition.

To describe the interaction
between the toluene molecules and the
adsorbent surface at room temperature, we calculated the Henry constant
from the water and toluene static adsorption isotherm (Figure 11) under relatively low pressure
(P/P0 < 0.1), where
the interaction between the adsorbed molecules could be ignored.15,18 As listed in Table 5, the H values of water vapor followed the order
PSNs (66.76) > n-PSN (18.19) ≈ p-PSN (16.69), whereas the H values of
PSNs were
3 times higher than that of functionalized PSNs. The big difference
demonstrated that the interaction between water molecules and the
PSNs surface was strongest. The functionalized surface of p-PSN and n-PSN exhibited a smaller interaction
with water molecules, further proving that the hydrophilic silicon
hydroxyl groups were grafted by organic groups.27 For static adsorption of toluene, the H values increased in the order of: p-PSN (264.20)
> PSNs (224.18) > n-PSN (150.09). p-PSN presented the strongest interaction with toluene molecules.
This phenomenon was caused by the π-interactions between the
surface functional phenyl groups and toluene,19,21 which was stronger than that between toluene and n-octyl or silicon hydroxyl groups. The H ratio (toluene/water)
combined the influence of water and toluene; as expected, p-PSN showed the highest value. This result signified the
best selectivity of toluene for phenyl-grafted surface under wet conditions,
in agreement with the dynamic adsorption performance.

n-PSN	150.09	18.19	8.25	
a The ratio was equal to values of H (toluene)/H (water).

As
discussed above, for industrial applications, rapid desorption
was also a critical factor. To test the desorption efficiency under
50% RH, PSN-based materials were regenerated by heating to 80 °C,
keeping the air flow constant for 20 min. As shown in Figure 12, the QWET of all materials remained relatively steady after six adsorption/desorption
cycles. p-PSN exhibited superior adsorption performance
in every cycle, which was considerably higher than that of pure PSNs,
demonstrating excellent stability. Grafting of organic groups on PSNs
not only preserved the hollow structure, which enabled the high efficiency
of toluene removal, but also improved the hydrophobicity. In summary, p-PSN showed a wide scope in toluene removal under both
dry and wet conditions. The effect of structure and morphology, ways
of surface modification, the amounts of organic groups, and even the
regeneration conditions are worth studying in future works.

3 Conclusions
In this study, PSN-based materials
with a uniform hollow structure
were successfully synthesized through a dynamic self-assembly method,
and then, their hydrophobicity was further modified by postgrafting
phenyl and n-octyl groups to yield p-PSN and n-PSN, respectively. The resultant PSN-based
materials showed uniform morphologies with hollow spherical shapes
after grafting. As supported by the dynamic adsorption–desorption
performance of toluene, the as-synthesized PSN-based materials exhibited
high adsorption capacities, desorption efficiency, and good stability.
Under dry conditions, the dynamic adsorption capacity and the desorption
efficiency (E5) of PSNs were far better
than those of the traditional mesoporous silicas. Under wet conditions,
functionalized PSN materials made up the defects of pure PSNs, holding
the excellent adsorption capacity and reusability. The Henry constants
from water vapor or toluene static adsorption of p-PSN demonstrated the best capture ability for toluene at room temperature.
These advantages of p-PSN can be due to the hollow
spherical structure and the phenyl groups grafted on the surface,
which improved the utilization of the adsorption sites and presented
stronger interaction with toluene molecules, respectively. With excellent
adsorption–desorption performance and stability, the future
looks bright for the application of p-PSN as an adsorbent
for controlling VOCs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of Porous Silica Materials
PSNs were synthesized
via a dynamic self-assembly method.37 CTAB
(cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 99%) was
used as the surfactant, and water and diethyl ether (98%) were used
as cosolvents. In a typical synthesis, 1.0 g of CTAB was dissolved
in 140 mL of H2O, then 1.6 mL of aqueous ammonia (25–28%)
and 40 mL diethyl ether were added into the solution, and stirred
vigorously for 0.5 h at room temperature. Then, 5 mL of tetraethoxysilane
(98%) was added dropwise to the solution under vigorous stirring and
the mixture was continuously stirred for 4 h at room temperature.
A white precipitate was obtained by filtration, dried in 60 °C,
and eventually calcined at 550 °C in air for 6 h. Silicalited-1,
KIT-6, and SBA-15 were prepared by the method reported in the literature.19,32 Commercial AC was purchased from Yantai Kelier Co., Ltd.

Functionalized
PSNs were performed by adding 1 g of pure PSNs to a mixture of 50
mL of toluene, 0.2 mL of H2O, 5 mL of triethoxyphenylsilane
(98%), or triethoxy(octyl)silane (97%). The mixture was stirred at
90 °C for 24 h and then filtered. The resulting white solid was
washed with toluene, ethanol, and deionized water and then air-dried
at 100 °C. The samples grafted with phenyl and n-octyl were named as p-PSN and n-PSN, respectively.

were recorded on a JEOL 2100F microscope operating at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV. The thermal decomposition behavior (DTG) was performed
on TGA8000. Each adsorbent was heated in the range of 30–800
°C with a liner heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under the flow of air. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were acquired
through an ASAP 2020 gas sorption analyzer. All of the adsorbents
were degassed at 120 °C for 6 h before measurements. The specific
surface area was calculated by using the BET equation. The pore diameter
was established based on the desorption branch of N2 isotherms
by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The
pore size distribution was estimated by the density functional theory
method. The micropore surface area and the micropore volume were obtained
from the t-plot method.

4.3 Dynamic
Toluene Adsorption and Desorption
Measurements
For the dynamic adsorption process, pelletized
samples (40–60 meshes) were degassed under atmospheric pressure
with heating (120 °C) for overnight. Next, about 0.1 g of the
treated samples was packed in a U-type quartz tube, and quartz wool
was plugged at the top and bottom of the tube as a support for the
adsorption bed. During the adsorption process, air was used as the
carrier gas with a total flow rate of 100 mL min–1 at 25 °C. The inlet concentrations of toluene were controlled
at 1000 ppmv under both dry/wet conditions (11, 19, 27, 37, and 50%
RH at 25 °C).

After the adsorption, the regeneration experiment
was carried out by heating the samples with simultaneous purge air
of 100 mL min–1 for 20 min at 80 °C and then
rapidly cooled to 25 °C for the next continuous adsorption test.
The entire process was repeated 4–6 times to investigate the
desorption efficiency and reusability of the samples. The concentration
at the outlet of the reaction bed was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph
equipped with a flame ionization detector.

The dynamic adsorption
capacity (Q, mg/g) of the
samples was calculated by the following equations21  where FA and W are the molar flow of toluene gas and the
weight of the
adsorbents, respectively, CA/C0 is the relative concentration of toluene at time t, respectively, and tD is the
dead time of the experimental setup.

The total desorption capacity
for each cycle was calculated as
follows  where fB and W are the
volume flow of air and the weight of the adsorbents,
respectively, CD is the concentration
of toluene outside the adsorption bed at time t,
respectively, and tD is also the dead
time. The desorption efficiency was equal to the value of Qd/Qa.

In this
study, the dynamic breakthrough curves of toluene are analyzed
with the Yoon–Nelson model (the Y–N model) to evaluate
the adsorption performance of the mesoporous silicas. The Y–N
model is a widely used kinetic theory model for VOC adsorption with
the equation as follows32  where C0 and Ct (ppmv) represent the inlet
and outlet concentrations at time t (min), respectively,
and τ (min) and k (min–1)
refer to the half-life for Ct = 50% C0 and the rate constant,
respectively.

4.4 Static Adsorption Measurements
Static
adsorption performance of toluene and water for PSN-based materials
was evaluated by using an intelligent gravimetric analyzer (IGA-100B,
Hiden Isochema Ltd) at 25 °C. This equipment has an ultrahigh
vacuum system, determining isotherm and the corresponding adsorption
kinetic by setting exact pressure steps. Before testing, the samples
were degassed under vacuum condition with heating (120 °C) for
8 h.

Under the relatively low pressure (P/P0 < 0.1), Henry’s law was used as
follows18  where q (%) and H represent the
adsorbed amount of molecular and the Henry constant,
respectively.
