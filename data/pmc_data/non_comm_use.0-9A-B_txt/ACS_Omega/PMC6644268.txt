The
development of a novel pretreatment system using catalysts
with high safety and low cost is pivotal to establish lignocellulosic
biorefinery. We evaluated 16 Lewis acid catalysts for microwave solvolysis
pretreatment to enhance enzymatic saccharification of woody biomass
and found that very cheap and safe food additives, alum, are effective
for the pretreatment, giving high sugar yield comparable to that of
AlCl3, a strong Lewis acid catalyst effective both for
softwood and hardwood. In microwave solvolysis of Japanese cedar, Paraserianthes falcataria and Eucalyptus
globulus using alum in ethylene glycol/water (9/1,
w/w), the maximum sugar yields after enzymatic saccharification reached
47.8, 51.0, and 59.7% based on the weight of each wood. The same reactions
in glycol/water (9/1, w/w) gave the sugar yield, 34.5, 54.1, and 58.5%,
indicating differential reactivity of the Lewis acid/solvent system
depending on wood species. We found that efficiency and selectivity
of pretreatment with a flocculating and astringent agent, Al2(SO4)3, was promoted by microwave. Reaction
of Japanese beech wood with Al2(SO4)3 in 50% aqueous 1-propanol by microwave and conventional heating
revealed that microwave irradiation suppressed excessive degradation
of carbohydrates into furfural derivatives. Saccharification of the
wood pretreated by microwave with 8 and 1 filter paper units of cellulolytic
enzymes gave sugar yields per wood of 50.3 and 43.9%, whereas the
same reaction in an autoclave resulted in 48.9 and 34.7% yields, demonstrating
that microwave irradiation accelerated the saccharification and the
effect was remarkable with a lower enzyme dosage.

==== Body
Introduction
The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass
into biofuels, chemicals,
energy, and new materials is becoming vital in solving the problems
of greenhouse gas emissions and depletion of fossil fuels.1,2 In enzymatic saccharification and fermentation of lignocellulosic
biomass, including woody biomass, disintegration of the plant cell
wall is necessary to increase the accessibility of cellulolytic and
hemicellulolytic enzymes to the cell wall polysaccharides, cellulose,
and hemicelluloses. In this study, we developed new pretreatment reactions
exhibiting microwave-sensitizer effects. Microwave pretreatment has
drawn attention from the aspect of its rapid and direct heating, and
reactions with acids, alkalis, and oxidative catalysts in aqueous
and organic solvents have been applied for pretreatments of hardwood,
softwood, and herbaceous biomass for enzymatic saccharification and
fermentation.3−11

In microwave heating, conduction loss, dielectric loss, and
magnetic
loss are the major energy-transfer paths, but solution reactions with
nonmagnetic molecules are mostly governed by dielectric loss and conduction
loss heating. Both mechanisms require effective coupling between the
components of the target material and the rapidly oscillating electric
field of the microwaves. Dipole rotation is an interaction in which
polar molecules align themselves with the rapidly changing electric
field of the microwaves.12,13 Collisions and friction
between the moving molecules result in heating. Heating by ionic conduction
is similar to the dipole rotation path, except that these ions or
ionic species interact with the oscillating electric field of the
microwaves. The energy level of the microwave radiation is too low
to produce direct chemical changes, such as breaking of covalent bonds
and excitation of electrons. However, if the catalyst or substrates
preferentially absorb the microwave energy, the energy absorbed is
transformed from a rapid oscillating electric field into thermal energy,14−16 forming high-temperature microscopic spots, which in many cases
cause a large temperature gradient, thereby promoting chemical reactions
that do not occur with conventional heating. Although the formation
of hot spots in solution reactions is difficult to prove directly,
acceleration of chemical reactions caused by microwave-absorbing spots
on solid particles has been demonstrated.14−16 In Grignard
reactions with electrically conductive Mg turnings, it was reported
that an electric field significantly accelerates or deactivates the
catalytic reaction depending on the applied electric field strength.17 Combination of CuO and H2O2 in alkaline media produced vanillin from softwood, and the reaction
was accelerated by electric and magnetic fields with a slightly more
prominent effect of electric fields.18 In
some reactions, microwaves increase not only the reaction rate but
also the selectivity of the reactions.19−22 Thus, microwave heating is useful
if microwave-absorbing spots can be controlled by an electromagnetic
field, and the reaction systems consist of catalysts, solvents, and
substrates.

Lewis acids as classic catalysts are sometimes utilized
for the
pretreatment of biomass.23,24 The β-O-4 ether
bond is the major mode of interunit linkages in lignin and a target
for Lewis acid reactions. The catalyst coordinates with oxygen atoms
of ethers to increase the dipole moment and to effectively cleave
the ether bonds.25,26 In this study, we therefore focused
on the potential of Lewis acids as microwave-sensitizer catalysts
for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass.

In the present
study, we applied microwave-assisted pretreatments
using Lewis acids to five species of wood, namely, Japanese cedar
(Cryptomeria japonica), Japanese beech
(Fagus crenata), Acacia
mangium, Paraserianthes falcataria, and Eucalyptus globulus, and found
significant pretreatment effects on all of the wood including the
recalcitrant softwood, Japanese cedar. A comparative study of the
Lewis acid reactions using microwave and conventional heating revealed
that the disintegration of wood cell walls was promoted by microwave
heating. The differential pretreatment effects on biomass conversion
are reported.

Results and Discussion
Screening of Catalyst and
Solvent
Fifteen Lewis acids
were used to screen the catalysts for microwave-assisted pretreatment
of woody biomass in 1-propanol/water (1/1, w/w). In addition to the
Lewis acids, an organic carboxylic acid, maleic acid, was used to
compare the efficiency with a Brønsted–Lowry acid with
a low pKa. After pretreatment, soluble
and insoluble (pulp) fractions were separated, and the pulp fraction
was subjected to enzymatic saccharification. Sugar yields based on
the weight of pulp and original wood are shown in Table 1. Aluminum Lewis acids effectively
disintegrated the wood, giving pulp yields of 43.2–48.5% and
high saccharification yields of 88.9–94.1% per pulp. Sugar
yields based on the weight of original wood reached 40.0–43.2%,
exceeding the yield using maleic acid.8 It is known that strong Lewis acids, including aluminum salts, are
readily hydrated in a water-containing solvent system to form metal-hydroxide
complexes such as [Al(OH)(H2O)5]2+ and [Al(H2O)4(OH)2]+.27,28 The hydrated aluminum catalyzes a wide range
of reactions such as reduction of ketones, reduction of carbon–carbon
double bonds, oxidation of alcohols to carbonyls, and cleavage of
ether and ester bonds. Cleavage of ether bonds probably plays a central
role in the degradation of lignin.

a Sample conditions: [catalyst] =
60 μmol (as Mn+ or cation)/g wood;
solvent, 1-propanol/water = 10 g/10 g; and treated wood, 1 g of beech
wood powder. MW irradiation conditions: power, 400 W; temperature,
180 °C; and irradiation time, 30 min. No catalyst was added in
the control experiment. All samples were saccharified without fibrillation
after MW irradiation.

Ferric
chloride gave high sugar yields comparable to those with
Al2(SO4)3. Zinc salts were less effective
than the Al and Fe salts. The effects of the other eight metal salts
were negligible. Among the series of metal chlorides examined, the
decrease in pulp yield, an index of wood degradation, was in the order
Al > Fe(III) > Zn(II) > Ca ≈ Na > Li. The order
of counter
anions in wood degradation was Br– > Cl– > SO4–. These results are in accordance
with the strength of the Lewis acids.29

The effects of solvents in microwave solvolysis were evaluated
using Al2(SO4)3 (Table 2). Fifty percent aqueous solutions
of 2-propanol, 1-octanol, methyl ethyl ketone, acetyl acetone, and
1-butanol were used for the reactions; 1-octanol, methyl ethyl ketone,
acetylacetone, and 1-butanol are water-immiscible solvents, giving
biphasic reaction systems. Among the solvents used, the highest saccharification
yield per pulp of 94.6% was obtained in the reaction with methyl ethyl
ketone. Acetyl acetone and 1-butanol gave similar sugar yields per
pulp of over 90%, and a decreased sugar yield of 72.4% was obtained
in the reactions with 1-octanol. However, because the solvent systems
giving high saccharification yields per pulp gave lower pulp yields,
significant differences in the overall sugar yield based on the weight
of original wood were not found among the solvent systems used. Thus,
we conclude that a wide range of organic solvents can be applied in
the pretreatments with Lewis acids. Striking differences in the sugar
yields were found between the reactions with and without catalysts
in all of the solvent systems used.

Differences
between Microwave and Conventional Heating
Beech wood powder
was pretreated with Al2(SO4)3 using
microwave and autoclave heating and saccharified
at 160 and 180 °C with 5 and 40 FPU of cellulase. As shown in Table 3, the microwave treatment
gave higher sugar yields compared with conventional heating, especially
at low reaction temperatures and/or low enzyme dosage. Microwave and
autoclave heating with the same reaction temperatures, times, catalyst
concentrations, and stirring speeds gave pulps with distinctive morphological
differences. The microwave treatment gave a pulp sheet that was more
finely defibrated (data not shown).

were saccharified without fibrillation after treatment.

We also compared the reactions of
beech wood with Al2(SO4)3 in 1-propanol/water
(1/1, w/w) using
microwave and conventional heating. The degradation products in the
soluble part were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) (Figure 1). In the microwave reactions, six lignin-derived compounds, hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF), and monosaccharides were detected (Figure 1a). In the conventionally heated reactions,
a variety of lignin degradation products with higher amounts of Hibbert
ketones and coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols were found (Figure 1b). The amount of monosaccharide
decreased as the HMF concentration increased, probably owing to the
thermal degradation of carbohydrates. The amounts of benzyl alcohol,
vanillin, and syringaldehyde were almost the same in the two reaction
systems. Thus, clear differences in reactivity were found between
microwave and conventional heating in biomass pretreatments using
Lewis acids in aqueous organic solvents.

products by GC–MS analysis between
microwave (a) and conventional heating (b) treatments. Sample conditions:
catalyst, Al2(SO4)3 ([Al3+] = 60 μmol/g wood); solvent, 1-propanol/water (10 g/10 g);
and treated wood, 1 g of Japanese beech wood powder. Treatment conditions:
temperature, 160 or 180 °C; irradiation time, 30 min.

The accelerating effects of microwave heating in
the Lewis acid
system are mainly governed by dipole rotation and ionic conduction.
In addition to the dipole rotation of the polar molecules, ionic species,
including Cl– from the Lewis acids, interact with
microwaves, resulting in distinctive differences in the reaction products.

Effects of Pretreatment Conditions on Sugar Yields from Enzymatic
Saccharification of Softwood and Hardwood
Five different
wood species were pretreated by microwave solvolysis using AlCl3 in ethylene glycol/water (9/1, w/w), and the effects of irradiation
time, temperature, and catalyst concentration on enzymatic saccharification
were analyzed. Figure 2A1–E1 demonstrates that the pulp yield decreased as the catalyst
concentration and reaction temperature increased. We found that the
sugar yield based on the weight of the original wood correlated well
with the pulp yield, although the plots in Figure 2A2–E2 (40 FPU/g pulp) and 2A3–E3 (8 FPU/g pulp) originated from reactions
with different amounts of catalyst and reaction temperatures. Enzymatic
hydrolysis with a higher amount of cellulase allows high sugar yields
with a wider range of pulp yields (Figure 2A2–E2), whereas the use of less enzyme
considerably narrows the optimal range and results in a smaller range
of pulp yields for all of the wood species (Figure 2A3–E3). In the treatment of Japanese
cedar wood, the optimal range is much narrower than that for hardwood
species. The maximum sugar yields of Japanese cedar, Japanese beech, A. mangium, P. falcataria, and E. globulus are 54.4, 54.7,
55.7, 63.1, and 60.8%, respectively, with 40 FPU/g pulp of cellulase
and 48.3, 47.1, 52.7, 59.2, and 52.7%, respectively, with 8 FPU/g
pulp of the enzyme.

AlCl3 catalyst (−1) and relationships between the
pulp yield and sugar yield following enzymatic saccharification (−2,

(18 g/2 g); treated wood, 1 g of Japanese cedar (A), Japanese beech
(B), A. mangium (C), P. falcataria (D), and E. globulus (E) powders. Treatment conditions: temperature, 140 °C (◊),
150 °C (▲), 160 °C (○), and 180 °C (■);
irradiation time, 10–30 min. Enzyme concentration for saccharification:
40 (−2) and 8 (−3) FPU/g pulp. All samples were saccharified
without defibration treatment.

Pretreatment Using Lewis
Acids with High Safety
Wood
powders of Japanese cedar, P. falcataria, and E. globulus were pretreated
with Al2(SO4)3 and AlK(SO4)2 in ethylene glycol/water (Table 4) and glycerol/water (Table 5) (9/1, w/w each). The treatment of Japanese
cedar using Al2(SO4)3 and AlK(SO4)2 in aqueous ethylene glycol resulted in a high
sugar yield comparable to that with AlCl3. These catalysts
were reactive with P. falcataria and E. globulus wood, giving high sugar yields over 50
and 55%, respectively. When the same reactions were carried out in
glycerol, the sugar yields decreased, except for the maximum sugar
yields from P. falcataria and E. globulus. The catalyst Al2(SO4)3 is used as a flocculating and astringent agent, and
its LD50 for oral administration in rats is >9000 mg/kg.30 AlK(SO4)2 is known as
alum and is widely used as a food additive and in cosmetics owing
to its high safety (LD50: N/A). Glycerol (LD50 = 12 600 mg/kg for oral administration in rats)31 is used for cosmetics and medical drugs. Thus,
the combination of AlK(SO4)2 in glycerol/water
is featured as the most eco-friendly and safe pretreatment system.

Conclusions
Pretreatment of woody biomass by microwave solvolysis with aluminum
salts, namely, AlCl3, Al2(SO4)3, and AlK(SO4)2, in aqueous organic
solvents was developed. The reactions were applicable to both recalcitrant
softwood and hardwood. In the reaction with AlCl3, microwave
irradiation accelerated the enzymatic saccharification, resulting
in a higher amount of monosaccharides in the soluble fraction. Thus,
microwave effects were found in the pretreatment system with the aluminum
salts. The use of alum and aluminum sulfate in glycerol is featured
as an eco-friendly reaction system using commodity chemicals with
high safety and a low price.

species, C. japonica (Japanese cedar), F. crenata (Japanese beech), A. mangium, P. falcataria, and E. globulus, was cut into chips. The chips were Wiley-milled,
and the powder formed was sieved to collect 14–30 mesh-sized
particles. The wood particles were air-dried to approximately 10%
moisture content and used throughout this study.

Japanese cedar,
Japanese beech, A. mangium, P. falcataria, and E. globulus contain 31.0, 23.0, 21.2, 26.5, and 22.2% of Klason lignin, 47.8,
49.9, 59.7, 52.5, and 46.6% of cellulose, and 20.3, 29.3, 20.1, 21.0,
and 30.2% of hemicelluloses, respectively.7,8,32,33 Meicelase
from Trichoderma viride (Meiji Seika
Co., Ltd.) was used as a saccharification enzyme. The activity of
the enzyme in filter paper units (FPU) was determined using an IUPAC
method.34 All chemicals were purchased
from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) or Nacalai
Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan).

Microwave Irradiation
Wood powder
(1 g) in dry weight
equivalent, a catalyst, and 20 g of mixed solvent were placed in a
pressure-tight vial for microwave irradiation. After sealing the vial,
it was microwave-irradiated using a Biotage Initiator 60 EXP instrument
(Uppsala, Sweden) at 140–180 °C for 10–30 min with
magnetic stirring at 900 rpm. The microwave power was automatically
optimized by the heating machine within the range 0–400 W to
adjust the temperature and irradiation time. The solution was vacuum-filtered
with Advantec no. 131 filter paper (3 μm pass-through). The
residual pulp was washed with acetone and water, and the pulp yield
was calculated using the following equation 1  

Enzymatic Saccharification
and Determination of Reducing Sugar
Concentration
The pulp fraction (0.2 g, in dry weight equivalent),
50 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.5, 10 mL), and Meicelase were placed in
a 50 mL centrifuge tube and incubated at 45 °C, 140 rpm for 48
h using a reciprocal-shaking thermostatic bath. The amount of enzyme
is described in each experimental section and the figure legends.
After the reaction, the reducing sugar concentration was determined
by the Somogyi–Nelson method.35 Sugar
yields based on the weight of pulp and original wood were calculated
using the following equations 2   3  

Analysis of Lignin Degradation
Products
Lignin degradation
products in the filtrate were determined by GC–MS after acetylation,
trimethylsilylation, and/or O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)oxime
(PFBO) derivatization. One millimole of fluoranthene (100 μL
in dichloromethane) was added to the filtrate (10–40 μL,
depending on the concentration of lignin fragments) in a small vial,
and the mixture was evaporated in vacuo before derivatization. In
acetylation, acetic anhydrate and pyridine (200 μL each) were
placed in the vial and reacted at 60 °C for 1 h. In trimethylsilylation, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide
(100 μL) and pyridine (200 μL) were placed in the vial
and reacted at 60 °C for 1 h. In PFBO derivatization, 5 mg/mL
of O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride
(PFBHA, 100 μL in methanol) was placed in the vial and reacted
at room temperature overnight. After derivatization, the solution
was evaporated and ethyl acetate (100 μL) was added. The solution
was then filtered using GL Chromatodisk 4P (0.45 μm pass-through)
to remove precipitates. The filtrate (1 μL) was subjected to
GC–MS analysis. The analysis was carried out with a Shimadzu
GCMS-QP5050A GC–MS (Kyoto, Japan) on a DB-1 column (length,
30 m; i.d., 0.25 mm; thickness, 1 μm; J&W Scientific Inc.,
CA). Electron impact mass spectrometry was performed at an ionization
energy of 70 eV. The column oven temperature was raised from 90 to
240 °C at 10 °C/min, then from 240 to 310 °C at 30
°C/min, and then maintained for 10 min.

Screenings of Catalyst
and Solvent for Microwave Treatment
To evaluate the efficiency
of the catalysts, LiCl, LiBr, NaCl,
CaCl2, AlCl3, AlBr3, Al2(SO4)3, FeCl3, ZnCl2,
ZnBr2, ZnSO4, MgSO4, NH4Cl, (NH4)2SO4, NH4Ac,
and maleic acid were used at a concentration of 60 μmol/g of
wood for the pretreatment of beech wood powder in 1-propanol/water
(1/1, w/w). In reactions with Al2(SO4)3, five solvent systems, 2-propanol/water, 1-octanol/water, methyl
ethyl ketone/water, acetyl acetone/water, and 1-butanol/water (1/1,
w/w each) were used. Reactions without catalysts were also conducted
as control experiments.

Comparative Experiments with Microwave and
Conventional Heating
Beech wood powder was pretreated by
microwave and conventional
heating at 160 or 180 °C for 30 min using Al2(SO4)3 (60 μmol/g of wood) in 1-propanol/water
(1/1, w/w), and the components in aqueous organic solution and the
sugar yields after enzymatic saccharification with two different amounts
of cellulase (5 or 40 FPU/g of pulp) were compared. In the two reaction
systems, the diameter of the reaction vessel and the stirring rate
were the same.

Optimization of Pretreatment Conditions in
Microwave Solvolysis
with AlCl3
The effects of the microwave irradiation
conditions and the concentration of the Lewis acid catalyst were analyzed
to determine the maximum sugar yields from the five wood species.
Microwave irradiation was carried out at 140–180 °C for
10–30 min using AlCl3 (60–720 μmol/g
of wood) in ethylene glycol/water (9/1, w/w). The pulp fraction was
subjected to enzymatic saccharification with 5 or 40 FPU of cellulase
per gram of pulp.

Microwave Pretreatment Using Lewis Acid Catalysts
with Higher
Safety
Wood powders of Japanese cedar, P.
falcataria, and E. globulus were pretreated using AlK(SO4)2 or Al2(SO4)3 (60–180 μmol/g of
wood) in ethylene glycol/water or glycerol/water (9/1, w/w). Microwave
irradiation was carried out at 160 and 180 °C for 30 min. The
amount of saccharification enzyme is 40 FPU/g of pulp.
