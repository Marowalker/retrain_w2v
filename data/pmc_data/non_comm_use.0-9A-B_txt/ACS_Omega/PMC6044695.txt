Fluorescence
probes are usually employed to analyze pharmacokinetics
of drug carriers; however, this method using usual probes is not suitable
to monitor drug carriers in detail because fluorescence spectra do
not change by the disruption of drug carriers. In this study, pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates were investigated as probes to monitor the state of
drug carriers in real time. 1-Pyrenemethanol was conjugated with fatty
acids, such as lauric acid, stearic acid, and behenic acid, and the
conjugates were stirred in ethanol, resulting in the formation of
submicron particles; these particles exhibited excimer emission. When
J774.1 and Colon 26 cells were treated with these particles, the associated
fluorescence spectra shifted from excimer emission to monomer emission.
Moreover, the degree of change was controlled by the type of fatty
acid. These results support the design of drug carriers that can be
used to monitor pharmacokinetics in real time and to control the disruption
time.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
fluorescent materials are being used in many devices,
including lasers,1 organic electroluminescence
displays,2 biosensors,3,4 and
bioimaging probes.5 In this context, a
few small organic molecules and fluorescent proteins are being studied
specifically for application as fluorescence probes in bioscience.
An advantage of small organic molecules is their design flexibility.
Small organic molecules can easily be modified by organic chemical
reactions to enable suitable exciting and emission wavelengths.6−9 These molecules can also be conjugated with other substances, such
as proteins,10 peptides,11−13 DNA,14,15 lipids,16−18 and silica particles,19 which proves their applicability in bioscience.

Pyrene and
pyrene derivatives are organic molecules typically used
as fluorescence probes. A highly concentrated pyrene solution20 or pyrene in the solid state21 shows an excimer emission at ∼475 nm because of
π–π stacking.22 This
phenomenon can be applied to monitor inter and intramolecular interactions.
For example, the interaction of a single strand of DNA was monitored
using interstrand stacked pyrenes.23 The
formation of double-strand DNA was revealed by the change in the fluorescence
spectrum of pyrene from monomer emission to excimer emission. Further,
the interaction between dipeptidyl ureas was investigated based on
the conjugation of dipeptidyl urea and pyrene.24 However, excimer emission is dependent not only on the
molecules but also on molecule aggregation. Pyrene and pyrene derivatives
are also used as probes to monitor the formation of micellar aggregates25,26 and gel matrices.27 Intriguingly, pyrene
derivatives were applied to monitor ion species and their concentration.28 Roy et al. developed phospholipid vesicles (liposomes)
containing lipid molecules with both pyrene (in the tail) and metal
ion chelators (in the head group); the liposomes exhibited pyrene
excimer fluorescence in the presence of a copper ion. Ion monitoring
was accomplished not only by the change to excimer emission but also
by the change to monomer emission.29 Two
pyrene moieties linked with O–Si–Si–O–
or O–Si–O– chains show excimer emission in a
tetrahydrofuran (THF)/H2O (v/v, 50/50) solution. This molecule
was incubated with a fluorine ion, resulting in a change from excimer
emission to monomer emission because of bond cleavage.

π–π
stacking is also expected to facilitate
pharmacokinetic analysis. In general, to analyze the pharmacokinetics
of drug carriers, fluorescence probes containing drug carriers are
used. However, this method cannot track the drug carrier itself but
tracks only the fluorescence probes. Therefore, it is difficult to
detect “when” and “where” a drug capsule
is disrupted and the encapsulated drug is released. To control the
pharmacological effect of drug carriers, it is necessary to control
the retention time (such as the development of PEGylated liposomes
to achieve long circulation times in the blood30,31). In recent years, the focus of research shifted from drug delivery
at the disease site to organelle-specific targeting.32−34 Thus, it is important to develop fluorescence probes to detect when
and where drug carriers are disrupted and drugs are released not only
at the organ level but also at the organelle level.

In this
study, particles composed of pyrene–fatty acid conjugates
were investigated as trackable drug carriers or excipients. Fatty
acids are typical biomolecules found in cell membranes and are considered
biocompatible. It is widely recognized that it is important to design
biomaterials depending on the purpose.35−38 In this context, it is easy to
control the physicochemical properties of biomaterials composed of
fatty acids by tailoring the length of the fatty acid. Herein, lauric
acid, stearic acid, and behenic acid were conjugated with 1-pyrenemethanol.
Solid-state pyrene–fatty acid conjugates were characterized
in terms of their physicochemical properties and fluorescence spectra.
Later, suspended pyrene–fatty acid conjugates in ethanol (EtOH)
were added to murine cells. The conjugates were immediately taken
up by the cells and subsequently disrupted. Finally, the relationship
between the time to disruption and acyl chain lengths of the fatty
acids is discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Physicochemical Properties of Pyrene–Fatty
Acid Conjugates
Pyrene–fatty acid conjugates synthesized
with lauric acid, stearic acid, and behenic acid are designated as
P–C12, P–C18, and P–C22, respectively, and their
chemical structures are shown in Figure 1a. They were further characterized by fluorescence
microscopy, and the results are shown in Figure 1b. The conjugates were found to be crystalline
in nature; Figure 2a shows their powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns. Sharp peaks
could be clearly observed, and the recorded patterns were different
from those of pyrene. This result suggests that these pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates exhibit different crystalline structures. According
to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, some of the fatty
acid molecules show not only a melting point but also a glass transition
(Figure S1).39Figure 2b shows the
DSC curves of the synthesized pyrene–fatty acid conjugates.
Although no glass transition could be observed, sharp peaks ascribed
to melting were apparent; melting peaks corresponding to P–C12,
P–C16, and P–C22 were found at 67.30, 82.02, and 89.50
°C, respectively. Thus, these pyrene–fatty acid conjugates
remain in the crystalline form at 37 °C (normal body temperature).
Moreover, Raman spectroscopy also supported the formation of stable
crystalline structures (Figure 2c). The peaks at 1074 and 1130 cm–1 are
assigned to gauche C–C stretch (υ(C–C)G) and trans C–C stretch (υ(C–C)T),
respectively, and the ratio of these peak intensities indicates the
ordering of pyrene–fatty acid conjugates.40 Peaks at 1130 cm–1 could be clearly observed
in the case of P–C18 and P–C22. This result indicates
that the hydrocarbon chains of P–C18 and P–C22 are crystalline
in nature. The peak intensities at 1074 and 1130 cm–1 were very weak in the case of P–C12. This might be ascribed
to the difficulty in detecting short acyl chains. Moreover, it has
been reported that at wavenumbers smaller than 600 cm–1, C–C–C out-of-plane bending vibrations occur, whereas
in the wavenumber range of 1250–1000 cm–1, C–H in-plane bending and rocking occur.41 At the same time, in the wavenumber range of 1650–1300
cm–1, aromatic C–C stretching vibrations
occur.41 These wavenumbers of peaks were
not completely same, although these peaks were observed in all samples.
This result suggests that the stacking states of the pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates were different from each other.

2.2 Optical Properties of Pyrene–Fatty
Acid Conjugates
To analyze the applicability of the synthesized
pyrene–fatty acid conjugates, their optical properties, especially
excimer emission properties, were investigated. Figure 3a,b shows the absorption and fluorescence
spectra of pyrene, P–C12, P–C18, and P–C22 solubilized
in hexane, respectively. In solution, the absorbance and fluorescence
spectra of the pyrene–fatty acid conjugates were similar to
each other but different from those of pyrene. The absorbance spectra
of pyrene–fatty acid conjugates slightly red-shifted to longer
wavelengths (300–350 nm). At 0.01 mM pyrene concentration,
the peaks of monomer emission were obviously different. The difference
was significant in the fluorescence spectra in the wavelength range
of 350–425 nm (inset of Figure 3b). This may be caused by the ester bond between pyrene
and fatty acids. However, at high concentrations (2.5 mM), the pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates exhibited excimer emission peaks (Figure S2). Thus, the optical function of pyrene, that is,
monomer/excimer fluorescence transition depending on the relative
distance between fluorophores, was maintained in the solution form
after conjugation with fatty acid molecules.

fluorescence spectra of pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates and pyrene in solution form (0.01 mM in hexane). (c)
Absorption and (d) fluorescence spectra of pyrene–fatty acid
conjugates and pyrene in the solid state.

The absorption and fluorescence spectra of pyrene, P–C12,
P–C18, and P–C22 in the solid state are shown in Figure 3c,d. It could be
observed that the monomer emission of pyrene–fatty acid conjugates
was different compared to that of pyrene. It has been reported that
the modification of functional groups with pyrene can influence the
appearance of their fluorescence spectra.6,42 Further,
the excimer emission spectra of pyrene and pyrene–fatty acid
conjugates were also different from each other. It has been reported
that absorbance peaks above 410 nm are related to excimer emission.43 The absorbance above 410 nm of pyrene was the
highest within the pyrene derivatives tested in this study, and the
excimer fluorescence intensity ratio of pyrene was certainly the highest.
This observation suggests that the acyl chains of pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates restricted the stacking of pyrene by steric hindrance.
However, all pyrene–fatty acid conjugates showed excimer emission
peaks similar to the spectra of pyrene–fatty acid conjugates
solubilized in hexane at high concentrations. Therefore, these pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates can potentially be applied as fluorescence probes
in pharmacokinetic analysis.

2.3 Application of Pyrene–Fatty
Acid Conjugates
as Trackable Drug Carriers or Excipients
To treat cells with
pyrene–fatty acid conjugates, the conjugates were initially
suspended in EtOH. The spherical-equivalent diameters of the suspended
particles and particle size distribution are shown in Table 1 and Figure S3, respectively. Particle size analysis is very important
because it controls the endocytic pathway.44,45 The sphere-equivalent diameters of P–C12 and P–C18
particles were 94.0 and 122.8 nm, respectively. On the other hand,
the sphere-equivalent diameter of P–C22 was 354.8 nm, which
is much larger than those of P–C12 and P–C18. When pyrene–fatty
acid conjugate suspensions were added to phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), fluorescence spectra were measured. The fluorescence spectra
of the pyrene–fatty acid conjugate particles are not completely
similar to those of pyrene–fatty acid conjugates in the solid
state (Figures 3d and 4). However, excimer emission peaks were observed.
This result suggests that the suspended particles can be used as a
fluorescence probe to analyze pharmacokinetic behaviors in detail.

Figure 4 Fluorescence
spectra of pyrene–fatty acid conjugate particles.

Table 1 Sphere-Equivalent Diameters of Pyrene–Fatty
Acid Conjugates

P–C18	123	
P–C22	355	
To analyze the uptake pathway,
the fluorescence intensities of
the pyrene–fatty acid conjugates absorbed in cells were measured
after incubation at 4 °C or after treatment with an endocytosis
inhibitor (Figure 5a). When J774.1 cells were incubated with pyrene–fatty acid
conjugates at 4 °C, the fluorescence intensities of the conjugates
reduced. Similarly, the fluorescence intensities decreased when the
conjugates were treated with endocytosis inhibitors, such as phenylarsine
oxide (PAO), wortmannin, cytochalasin B, cytochalasin D, and ethyl
isopropyl ether (EIPA). However, in the case of methyl-β-cyclodextrin
(MβCD), there was no reduction in the fluorescence intensities
of the pyrene–fatty acid conjugates. Therefore, the J774.1
cells took up pyrene–fatty acid conjugates by an endocytic
pathway; the contribution of caveola-mediated endocytic pathways is
little. No size-dependent differences could be observed in the endocytic
pathways. On the other hand, when Colon 26 cells were treated with
the pyrene–fatty acid conjugates, the reduction in their fluorescence
intensities was not adequate enough to determine the endocytic pathway
(Figure 5b). This suggests
that the Colon 26 cells absorbed a part of the pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates through the plasma membrane by diffusion. From this
discussion, it is obvious that the uptake mechanism is dependent on
the cell line.

endocytosis
inhibitors) of J774.1 cells and Colon 26 cells, respectively. (c,d)
Measurement of the disruption time (ratio of excimer emission) and
(e,f) cytotoxicity (MTT assay) of pyrene–fatty acid conjugates
with respect to J774.1 cells and Colon 26 cells, respectively.

Figure 5c,d shows
the disruption times of the excimer fluorescence of pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates used to treat J774.1 and Colon 26 cells, respectively.
They were evaluated using the IM/IE ratio. IM and IE show the maximum fluorescence intensity of
monomer and excimer emission, respectively. When the J774.1 and Colon
26 cells were treated with P–C12, the fluorescence spectra
changed smoothly from an excimer emission mode to a monomer emission
mode. After uptake by the cells, the excimer emission of P–C12
decreased drastically, indicating that the assembly of pyrene–fatty
acid conjugate particles was disrupted. Therefore, the particles of
P–C12 might be disrupted smoothly, independent of the cell
line and uptake pathway. On the other hand, the changes in the fluorescence
spectra of P–C18 and P–C22 were smaller than those in
P–C12. Therefore, it can be theorized that the particles of
pyrene–fatty acid conjugates with longer acyl chains are not
disrupted significantly.

The acyl chain lengths of pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates also
affected their cytotoxicity. Figure 5e,f illustrates the cytotoxicity of pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates toward J774.1 and Colon 26 cells, respectively. The
cytotoxicity of P–C12 was less than that of P–C18 and
P–C22. As described previously, the particles of P–C12
were disrupted smoothly after uptake, independent of the cell line.
Thus, it seems that pyrene–fatty acid conjugate particles were
taken by the endocytic pathway, and P–C12 was metabolized more
smoothly compared to P–C18 and P–C22, resulting in a
lower cytotoxicity (Figure 6).

by J774.1 cells.

3 Conclusions
The fluorescence spectra of pyrene changed from excimer emission
to monomer emission because of the disruption of particles. On the
basis of this property, pyrene–fatty acid conjugates can be
used to analyze pharmacokinetics. Moreover, the particle size, disruption
time, and cytotoxicity of pyrene–fatty acid conjugates are
controlled by the length of the used fatty acid. When J774.1 cells
were treated with small particles of P–C12 or P–C18
or large particles of P–C22, the particles were taken up by
the cells according to clathrin-dependent endocytosis and/or micropinocytosis.
The P–C12 particles were smoothly disrupted and showed low
cytotoxicity. On the other hand, particles of P–C18 and P–C22
did not exhibit any significant disruption and consequently exhibited
high cytotoxicity. Thus, considering the differences in the disruption
time, it is expected that the release of drugs cocrystallized with
pyrene–fatty acid conjugates can be controlled by manipulating
the choice of fatty acids.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
1-Pyrenemethanol was purchased
from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The fatty acids—(lauric
acid (C12), stearic acid (C18), and behenic acid (C22))—and
1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). THF, chloroform, hexane, ethanol, and dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries
(Osaka, Japan).

4.2 Synthesis and Crystallization
of Pyrene–Fatty
Acid Conjugates
Pyrene–fatty acid conjugates were
synthesized using CDI as the condensation reagent (Figure S4). Equimolar amounts of the fatty acid and CDI were
dissolved in THF, followed by stirring for 8 h at 60 °C. An equimolar
amount of 1-pyrenemethanol was added to this solution, which was then
subjected to further stirring for 24 h at 60 °C. The synthesized
pyrene–fatty acid conjugates were purified by silica gel chromatography
[ethyl acetate/hexane = 1:5, silica gel 60N (Kanto Chemical Co. Inc.,
Tokyo, Japan)], followed by washing with ethanol overnight. The purity
of the obtained pyrene–fatty acid conjugates was evaluated
by liquid-state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance [1H NMR; JNM-ECX-400 (JEOL Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)] spectroscopy (Figure S5).

4.3 Crystal
Growth, Analysis of the Crystal Structure,
and Characterization of the Physicochemical Properties of Pyrene–Fatty
Acid Conjugates
Crystals of pyrene and pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates were obtained by evaporation in a chloroform solution
(50 mM). The obtained crystals were analyzed using a fluorescence
microscope (IX51) with a WU filter (Ex: 330–385 nm, Em: 420
nm) (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The crystallinities of the samples (15
mg) were analyzed using an XRD instrument (XRD-6100, Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan). The diffraction patterns were generated in the 2θ range
of 10°–50° at a scanning rate of 4.0° min–1 using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA. DSC
analysis of these crystals was conducted using an X-DSC7000 differential
scanning calorimeter (Hitachi High-Tech Science, Tokyo, Japan). The
samples were placed in aluminum pans and hermetically sealed; they
were then cooled to 30 °C, followed by heating at 5 °C/min
to 200 °C. The Raman spectra of pyrene and pyrene–fatty
acid conjugate crystals were recorded using a confocal Raman microscope
(LabRAM HR-800, Horiba Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). A YAG laser (785 nm) was
used for excitation, and a 20× objective lens was used for the
measurement.

4.4 Absorption and Fluorescence
Measurements of
Pyrene–Fatty Acid Conjugates
The absorption spectra
of pyrene and pyrene–fatty acid conjugates solubilized in hexane
(0.01 mM) or in the solid state were measured using an ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
The fluorescence spectra of pyrene and pyrene–fatty acid conjugates
solubilized in hexane (0.01 or 2.5 mM) or in the solid state were
recorded using an RF-5300PC fluorometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at
an excitation wavelength of 336 nm. During the fluorescence spectral
analysis of pyrene and pyrene–fatty acid conjugates solubilized
in hexane, the temperature was maintained at 60 °C to achieve
complete dissolution.

4.5 Cells and Cell Culture
Murine J774.1
macrophage-like cells and murine cells derived from rectal cancer
(Colon 26 cells) were provided by the RIKEN BRC through the National
BioResource Project of MEXT, Japan. These cells were cultured in Eagle’s
minimum essential medium (E-MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) in a humidified atmosphere of 5.0% CO2 at 37 °C.

4.6 Preparation of Pyrene–Fatty Acid Conjugate
Particles and Measurement of Fluorescence Spectra
The synthesized
pyrene–fatty acid conjugates were suspended in EtOH because
it is difficult to add pyrene–fatty acid conjugates in the
solid state to cells directly. The particle preparation procedure
is as follows. The conjugates (50 μmol) were added to 1 mL of
EtOH and stirred for 24 h. Assuming complete dissolution, the final
concentration of the pyrene–fatty acid conjugates was 50 mM.
The sizes of the conjugate particles in EtOH were measured using Zetasizer
nanoZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). These
suspensions were first diluted with EtOH until they could be analyzed.
To generate the fluorescence spectra of the conjugate particles, 30
μL of the suspended particles was added to 3 mL of PBS (137
mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, and 2 mM
KH2PO4; pH 7.3) and fluorescence spectra of
these solutions were measured.

4.7 Evaluation
of Particle Uptake by Cells
The uptake pathway of pyrene–fatty
acid conjugate particles
was analyzed as described below. Cells were seeded on 6-well culture
plates (2 mL, 2.0 × 105 cells/mL) and cultured for
24 h in E-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS in an incubator. Subsequently,
the culture medium was replaced with 2 mL of fresh medium. The cells
were then treated with endocytosis inhibitors, that is, 20 μL
of 200 mM MβCD in PBS,46 20 μL
of 0.30 mM PAO in DMSO,47,48 20 μL of 5.0
mM wortmannin in DMSO,49,50 1.92 μL of 20.85 mM cytochalasin
B in DMSO,47 3.84 μL of 9.85 mM cytochalasin
D in DMSO,47,51 and 20 μL of 2.0 mM EIPA
in DMSO.52,53 The types of inhibitors, inhibitory pathways,
and final concentrations of the inhibitors are listed in Table S1. After incubation for 2 h, 20 μL
of 50 mM pyrene–fatty acid conjugate particles were added to
the cells. The cells were then further incubated for 15 min and washed
twice with PBS. They were then treated with trypsin, followed by washing
twice with PBS. The fluorescence spectra of the pyrene–fatty
acid conjugates in the cell suspension were measured using an RF-5300PC
fluorometer (Shimadzu; Kyoto, Japan). The conjugates in the cell suspensions
were excited at 336 nm, and spectra in the wavelength range of 350–600
nm were recorded. The maximum fluorescent intensities in the wavelength
ranges of 350–430 and 430–600 nm were considered to
be the fluorescent intensities corresponding to monomer emission (IM) and excimer emission (IE), respectively. The uptake of P–C12 particles and
particles of pyrene–fatty acid conjugates with long acyl chains
(P–C18 and P–C22) was evaluated in terms of IM and IE because
only the P–C12 particles were disrupted smoothly in the cells
(see Results and Discussion). The uptake quantity
was evaluated by comparing the cells treated with pyrene–fatty
acid conjugate particles with intact cells.

4.8 Monitoring
of the Disruption of Particles
by Fluorescence Spectral Analysis
The time to disruption
of the pyrene–fatty acid conjugate particles was measured using
a method similar to the one described in the previous section. Cells
were seeded on 6-well culture plates (2 mL, 2.0 × 105 cells/mL) and cultured for 24 h in E-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS
in an incubator. The culture medium was then replaced with 2 mL of
fresh medium containing 20 μL of 50 mM of pyrene–fatty
acid conjugate particles suspended in EtOH. The cells were incubated
for 15 min, and the culture medium was then replaced with 2 mL of
fresh medium to evaluate the disruption of initially taken pyrene–fatty
acid conjugate particles. At the end of the incubation time, the cells
were treated with trypsin and washed twice with PBS. The fluorescence
spectra of the pyrene–fatty acid conjugates in cell suspensions
were measured using an RF-5300PC fluorometer. The time to disruption
was evaluated based on the ratio of IM and IE.

4.9 Evaluation
of Cytotoxicity by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
Bromide Assay
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay was performed using a CellTiter 96 Non-Radioactive
Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). Cells
were seeded on 96-well culture plates (100 μL, 2.0 × 105 cells/mL) and cultured for 24 h in E-MEM supplemented with
10% FBS in the incubator. The culture medium was later replaced with
100 μL of fresh medium. Subsequently, 1 μL of ∼100
mM pyrene–fatty acid conjugate (final concentration: 5.0 ×
10–4 to 1 mM) was added to the cells; the cells
were then incubated for 24 h (37 °C, 5% CO2). A dye
solution (15 μL) was added to the medium. After incubation for
4 h, 100 μL of solubilization solution/stop mix was added to
the medium. After incubation for 1 h at 25 °C, the absorbance
of each well was measured using a microplate spectrophotometer, iMark
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The ratio of cell viability was calculated
using the following equation  where A570 and A630 are the absorbance values at 570 and 630
nm, respectively, when cells were treated with pyrene–fatty
acid conjugate particles. A570(0) and A630(0) refer to the absorbance values at 570
and 630 nm, respectively, when cells were treated with PBS. The absorbance
at 570 nm was measured to determine the quantity of formazan dye.
The absorbance at 630 nm was measured to reduce the effect of cell
debris.
