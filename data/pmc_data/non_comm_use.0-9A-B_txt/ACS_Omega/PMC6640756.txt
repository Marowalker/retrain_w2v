A novel template-activation
method was used to create nanoporous
carbon materials derived from core–shells@rGO sheets. The carbon
materials were prepared through an acid etching and thermal activation
procedure with three-dimensional Fe3O4@C@rGO
composites as precursors and Fe3O4 nanoparticles
as the structural template. The activation at different temperatures
could provide materials with different specific surface areas. The
unique nanoporous structures with large surface areas are ideal adsorbents.
The nanoporous carbon materials were used as adsorbents for the removal
of rhodamine B (Rh-B). C@rGO-650 illustrated better adsorption performance
than the other synthesized adsorbents. It displayed good recyclability,
and its highest adsorption capacity reached up to 14.8 L·g–1. The remarkable adsorption properties make nanoporous
carbon a useful candidate for wastewater treatment. This template-activation
method can also broaden the potential applications of core–shells@sheet
structures for the construction of nanoporous carbon, which helps
to resolve the related energy and environmental issues.

1 Introduction
The
design and construction of new types of nanoporous carbon materials
have become a research focus in recent decades because of their many
valuable uses in adsorption, separation, energy storage and conversion,
sensors, and drug delivery.1−6 The porous carbons are prepared generally via physical or chemical
activation techniques and template-assisted synthesis. Because of
the disorder and uncontrollable pore structures generated through
the activation techniques, the template-assisted syntheses have been
extensively used to create porous carbon materials.7,8 Controllable
porous carbon materials are generally produced through the calcination
of corresponding organic and polymer precursors employing soft or
hard templates. Thus, the development of appropriate templates and
precursors for nanoporous samples is promising and necessary for this
research field. Certain hard or soft templates, such as inorganic
matrices (e.g., calcium acetate and SiO2 spheres) and surfactant-derived
materials (e.g., block copolymers), have been used to manufacture
porous carbon materials.9−13 Despite the research on novel templates, various precursors have
also been researched recently, for example, resins, polymers, and
metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).14−18 However, the template-assisted assembly and activation
processes from reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets are not researched
in depth at this stage. The rGO materials may be used as potential
blocks for the construction of porous carbon materials because of
their special two-dimensional layerlike structure with a very high
surface area of 2630 m2·g–1, superior
mechanical rigidity, and excellent chemical stability.19−22 If the uniform pore structure on the rGO sheets can be obtained
via template-assisted synthesis and activation route, the porous carbon
materials will be created through an assembly approach. A large number
of nanocomposites have been fabricated via the assembly of rGO sheets
with inorganic nanoparticle (NP) cores and carbon shells. The potential
reactivity between inorganic NPs and rGO sheets can be used to manufacture
pore structures on the rGO sheets. Considering all of the aspects
mentioned above, a novel template-activation method derived from core–shells@rGO
sheets was proposed to create nanoporous carbons.

In this study,
nanoporous carbons were created through an acid-etching
and thermal activation procedure using core–shells@rGO sheet
composites (Fe3O4–C@rGO) as precursors
and using Fe3O4 NPs as a unique template (Scheme 1). The as-prepared
carbon materials possess developed micropores and mesopores with high
surface areas. The unique nanoporous carbon materials exhibited excellent
adsorption performances for the removal of Rh-B in wastewater treatment.
This novel synthesis process is a potential method for constructing
porous nanostructures with a wide range of applications.

2.1 Chemicals
Iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate
(Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd., China, AR), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW 24 000,
Aladdin Industrial Co., Ltd., AR), hexamethylenetetramine (urotropine,
Coring Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., AR), glucose anhydrous (C6H12O6, Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd., AR), ethanol (C2H5OH, Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd., China, AR), and rhodamine B (Rh-B, Tianjin Kemiou
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., AR). All reagents were obtained commercially
and used without any further purification.

2.2 Preparation
of Materials
Fe3O4@C-rGO was prepared
following a previously reported
method with a slight modification.23 Briefly,
graphite oxide (0.20 g) was dispersed into
H2O (0.20 L) effectively using sonication and stirring
for 120 min. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (18.870
g) and PVP (0.15 g) were then added dropwise to the above-mentioned
suspensions, and the mixture was left under stirring at ambient temperature
for 4 h. Then, hexamethylenetetramine (4.900 g) was dissolved in H2O (30 mL) and the solution was added dropwise. After 0.5 h
of stirring, the solution of glucose (4.250 g dissolved in 10 mL of
H2O) was then dissolved slowly. The dispersion system was
under stirring for a further 0.5 h, and then it was placed into a
Teflon-lined autoclave (0.5 L). The autoclave was maintained at 453
K for one day. The brown solid obtained after the solution was naturally
cooled down to a moderate temperature was collected via filtration,
washed with H2O (3 × 5 mL), and finally dried (85
°C, 120 min). The solid was ground and annealed at 550 °C
(at a heat ramp of 10 °C·min–1) for 60
min in continuous N2. The black powder obtained was denoted
as FCG (3.80 g). The as-synthesized FCG (3.80 g) was immersed in HCl
(6 M, 30 mL) and stirred overnight at room temperature to remove the
Fe3O4 particles deposited, and then the powder
was collected by repetitive centrifugation (6000 rpm, 2 min) from
H2O with subsequent freeze-drying for 36 h. The resultant
powder was denoted as C@rGO. The C@rGO powder was treated at 550,
650, and 750 °C for 60 min in a N2 atmosphere, with
a heating rate of 5 °C·min–1. After being
naturally cooled down to a moderate temperature, the products were
obtained and denoted as C@rGO-550, C@rGO-650, and C@rGO-750, respectively.

2.3 Characterization
The nanoporous structures
of the as-synthesized samples were explored by a high-resolution transmission
electron microscope (HRTEM; FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN electron microscope)
operated at 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples
were recorded using a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54 Å. The Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra of samples were recorded using a Nicolet
380 spectrometer. The Raman spectra of samples were collected using
Renishaw RM-2000 with an Ar-ion laser (λ = 514 nm; power = 50
mW). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of samples were studied using
a PHI quantera SXM spectrometer (Al excitation source; Kα = 280.00 eV), and the binding energies were adjusted according to
the C 1s peak (284.8 eV). The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms were studied at 77 K by employing NOVA 1000e (Quantachrome
Instruments, USA). The surface areas (SBET) of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model were calculated
according to the nitrogen adsorption curves in the P/P0 range of 0.05–0.35. Pore size
distributions were estimated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) model, and the total pore volumes were calculated from the amount
of N2 adsorbed at about P/P0 = 0.99.

2.4 Adsorption Test
The adsorption tests
of the as-synthesized products were performed under the following
conditions: aqueous Rh-B solution (1 × 10–5 M) was prepared and applied to measure the effects of adsorption.
Then, the designated amount of adsorbents (25
mg) was added to Rh-B (125 mL) under stirring at room temperature.
The suspension (4.0 mL) was drawn out and separated by centrifugation
at 6000 rpm for 1 min at given intervals (2 min). The static adsorption
was conducted with the same amount of adsorbents and Rh-B solution
but without stirring at room temperature. Also, the suspension was
drawn out and separated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 1 min at
given intervals (10 min). The UV–visible spectroscopy (UV-5500PC,
Shanghai Yuanxi Tech. Ins. Lim.) was employed to measure the absorbance
at a fixed wavelength of 554 nm. The adsorption capacities were calculated
by the following equation 1  where Va represents
the volume of the Rh-B solution, Cb(Rh-B) represents the concentration of the Rh-B solution, Wm represents the relative molecular mass of the Rh-B solution,
and madsorbent represents the mass of
C@rGO-650 used in adsorption tests.

The capacity of wastewater
treatment was evaluated by this equation 2  where Va represents
the volume of the Rh-B solution and madsorbent is the mass of C@rGO-650.

3 Results
and Discussion
These nanoporous carbon products designed
were produced through
the preparation of Fe3O4@C-rGO three-dimensional
(3D) core–shell composites as precursors, followed by an acid-etching
and thermal activation treatment (Scheme 1). The precursors were synthesized by the
precipitation reaction, hydrothermal process, and calcination treatment.
During the precipitation reaction, Fe(OH)3 sheets were
assembled with flaky GO. During the next hydrothermal reaction, the
Fe(OH)3 sheets were coated with sugar polymers via glucose
carbonization. Calcination treatment facilitated the carbonization
of polymers and reduction of GO. In addition, Fe(OH)3 sheets
were changed to Fe3O4 NPs in this calcination
procedure. Meanwhile, the polymers were converted to C shells, carbon
monoxide, and carbon dioxide. Thus, Fe3O4@C
core–shell structures were generated and were made up of Fe3O4 NPs as cores and carbon as shells (Figure S1). Fe3O4@C-rGO
3D core–shell composites as a precursor were then prepared.
Moreover, the porous carbon material (C@rGO) was produced by etching
the precursor in an HCl solution to get rid of Fe3O4. Then, these carbon materials (C@rGO) produced were activated
at different temperatures (550, 650, and 750 °C) in a N2 atmosphere for 1 h. It is interesting to note that the thermal activation
temperature has important influence on the structural features of
the resulting carbon materials. The samples obtained are expected
to have different physical properties such as surface area, adsorption
properties, and so on.

The morphology of the FCG precursor was
characterized by using
TEM images (Figure S1). Fe3O4 NPs encapsulated in those carbon shells were attached to
the rGO sheets. It is demonstrated that the Fe3O4 NPs@carbon core–shell structure was produced successfully.
As mentioned earlier, FCG composites can be converted into porous
carbon materials through the acid-etching and thermal activation procedure.
As shown in Figure 1, the porous structure of the composite materials was clearly observed.
C@rGO-650 possesses obviously more and bigger pores than C@rGO, C@rGO-550,
and C@rGO-750 (Figures 1 and S2). If examined closely, the carbon
sheets consist of many pores. The sheets of C@rGO-750 seem to be broken.
The morphologies are associated with their specific surface areas
of 472, 75, 321, and 359 m2·g–1,
respectively. This suggests that a proper thermal activation temperature
is critical for the formation of pores. A very low activation temperature
is unable to form sufficient pores, whereas a very high activation
temperature leads to the collapse of the skeleton and reduces specific
surface areas.

and (f) C@rGO-750.

In XRD patterns, the
diffraction peaks of the FCG nanocomposites
were fitted well with those of standard Fe3O4 (JCPDS card no. 19-0629), indicating well-crystallized Fe3O4 with a face-centered cubic structure (Figure S3).23 After acid-etching
and thermal activation, the characteristic peaks of Fe3O4 disappeared. The XRD patterns of the four carbon samples
display two broad peaks around 2θ = 26° and 43°, corresponding
to the (002) and (100) diffraction patterns of amorphous graphitic
carbon (Figure 2a).24−26 The weak and broad peaks revealed that the degree of graphitization
and crystallinity was decreased because of the short-range ordered
structure and the formation of amorphous carbon.27,28 In the FT-IR spectra of the four samples, these broad bands at 3210–3655
cm–1 represent the vibration of O–H in C–OH
(Figure 2b).29 The peaks at 1560 cm–1 displayed
the C=C bond in rGO and carbon.30,31 The two peaks
at 1406 and 1160 cm–1 revealed the stretching vibration
bands of C–N and C–O–C, respectively.32,33 In the Raman spectra of the four samples obtained, there are two
prominent bands (Figure 2c). The D bands with peaks around 1345 cm–1 are
in virtue of the C atoms dangling in disordered rGO and carbon. The
G bands with peaks around 1590 cm–1 are due to the
stretching modes of C=C of the graphene domains, presenting
the E2g mode of graphene. All intensities of the D bands
are stronger than those of the G bands (ID/IG > 1), which is a typical feature
for nanosized disordered graphenic carbons.34,35 The emergence of 2D peaks at 2700 cm–1 exhibits
that the regions selected consisted of few-layer carbons.36,37 The XPS survey spectrum
of C@rGO-650 verifies the existence of zero-valence carbon and trace
nitrogen dopants (Figure 2d). N elements in the FT-IR spectra and the XPS spectrum come
from the pyrolysis of PVP. The C1s spectrum could be approximately
fitted into three peaks, which were centered at 284.7, 285.6, and
288.2 eV. The peak at 284.7 eV displays the contribution from sp2 C=C bonds, whereas the one at 285.6 eV represents
the contribution from C–OH and C–O–C bonds.38 The peak at 288.2 eV is ascribed to the C=O
bond.39,40 The shrinkage of the peak at about 290.1
eV related to the O–C=O bond confirms the high degree
of reduction of rGO.

and (c)
Raman spectra of C@rGO, C@rGO-550, C@rGO-650, and C@rGO-750, and (d)
XPS spectra of C 1s of C@rGO-650 (in which the inset shows the survey
spectrum).

The surface areas and porous structures
of the four carbons were
evaluated by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at
77 K (Figure 3). The
N2 isotherms of the carbon samples all display type IV
curves and distinct hysteresis loops, which indicated the existence
of mesoporous structures.41 Moreover, the
adsorption capacity and hysteresis loop of C@rGO are much smaller
than others, which is in agreement with its lowest SBET. The SBET of C@rGO is
only 75 m2·g–1, whereas it increased
distinctly to 321 m2·g–1 after thermal
activation at 550 °C. As the activation temperature is further
increased to 650 °C, the SBET increases
continuously to 472 m2·g–1. The
value decreases at 750 °C, and the SBET of the corresponding samples is 359 m2·g–1. It is obvious that some mesopores have been destructed when the
activation treatment is performed at 750 °C. The pore diameter
distribution curves are still similar to each other (Figure S4). The pore volumes of C@rGO, C@rGO-550, C@rGO-650,
and C@rGO-750 are 0.13, 0.31, 0.42, and 0.53 cm3·g–1, respectively. Therefore, it is inferred that the
generation and the collapse of pores coexist as the activation temperature
was increased.26

The successful fabrication of
composites with large specific surface
areas and mesoporous structures encouraged us to investigate their
performances in the adsorption removal of organic dyes from an aqueous
solution. Figure 4a
exhibits the Rh-B adsorption removal performances of FCG, C@rGO, C@rGO-550,
C@rGO-650, and C@rGO-750 in the time period of 0–10 min. The
inferior adsorption performances were obtained for FCG because of
its limited number of pores. Because of the low surface area of C@rGO,
moderate adsorption performances were obtained. Compared with other
three composites, C@rGO-650 exhibits the highest adsorption rate (pH
= 7) because of its largest specific surface area. An enlarged specific
surface area and the mesoporous structure play a critical role in
the enhanced adsorption performances. It was expected that the adsorption
properties of these four carbon materials agreed well with their specific
surface areas. The recyclability of materials is of importance for
their potential wide range of practical applications. Therefore, after
the adsorption removal of Rh-B from its aqueous solution, C@rGO-650
was regained by centrifugation and then was soaked in ethanol (4 mL
× 5) using ultrasonication for 5 min to wash the residual Rh-B.
After being dried at 100 °C for 1 h, the samples recovered were
added to the Rh-B solution to perform a new adsorption separation
cycle. C@rGO-650 shows a high adsorption separation efficiency and
complete removal of Rh-B from water within 8 min. The sample almost
retains its adsorption ability and rate after being recycled six times
(Figure 4b). This high-efficiency
renewing strategy qualifies these
composites as economic adsorbents.

for the adsorption of Rh-B solution (a) 125 mL with 25 mg of various
adsorbents, (b) 60 mL with recycled 20 mg of C@rGO-650, (c) 125 mL
with 25 mg of C@rGO-650 at various pH values, (d) 125 mL of the Rh-B
solution with 25 mg of various adsorbents for static adsorption, (e) ln(C/C0) vs time plots for the adsorption of 120 mL of the Rh-B

adsorbent C@rGO-650, (g) the Rh-B solution, (h) adsorbent C@rGO-650
scattered in the Rh-B solution, and (i) clear solution after several
minutes.

It is suggested that C@rGO-650
was not damaged during the adsorption
process and maintained a good adsorption stability. C@rGO-650 also
exhibited good adsorption separation performance in the basic (pH
= 12) environment comparable to that in the neutral (pH = 7) environment
(Figure 4c). Its adsorption
separation rate was slightly lower in the acidic (pH = 2) environment
than that in the neutral environment. This phenomenon could be ascribed
to the various charge states of dye molecules and ionic strengths
of solution adjusted by changing the pH.37 The static adsorption performances of the four materials also were
investigated in the time range of 0–120 min (Figure 4d). With the same amount of
the adsorbent and Rh-B solution as those for static adsorption, the
entire adsorption was completed on C@rGO-650 within 120 min. A significant
adsorption capacity of C@rGO-650 has been obtained, revealing its
effective utility in the wastewater treatment process. A linear relationship
between ln(C/C0) and
the adsorption time (t) was observed with C@rGO-650,
leading to a deeper understanding of the adsorption kinetics of Rh-B
removal (Figure 4e).
The typical linearity presents that the adsorption occurred is a first-order
reaction. This is in good accordance with the previous reports.42−45 The visual effects of adsorption performances for the removal of
Rh-B were displayed with C@rGO-650 (Figure 4f–i). It was also observed that the
supernatant in the mixture turned nearly colorless and transparent
after being static for several minutes. This effective separation
process suggests that C@rGO-650 is an excellent alternative adsorbent.
The adsorption properties of the commercial activated carbon particles
were also tested for comparison. The absorption efficiencies of activated
carbon particles for the removal of Rh-B were 5% after 10 min and
then reached up to 100% after 1200 min, whereas the adsorption efficiencies
of C@rGO-650 were 100% after 10 min (Figure S5). The adsorption test was performed by extending the time to obtain
the optimum adsorption performances of C@rGO-650. The maximum adsorption
quantity and the wastewater treatment capacity of C@rGO-650 were 74
mg·g–1 and 14.8 L·g–1, respectively (Figure S6), which are
higher than those of other adsorbents described in the previous reports.46−48 These better adsorption performances demonstrated that C@rGO-650
can be used as an effective adsorbent for the removal of organic pollutants
from an aqueous solution.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
nanoporous carbon materials were generated by the
template-activation method through the acid-etching and thermal activation
procedure by using a 3D core–shells–sheets composite
as a precursor and Fe3O4 NPs as a unique template.
The as-prepared carbon materials possess a large quantity of pores
with high surface areas. C@rGO-650 exhibits significantly improved
adsorption ability with good recyclability for Rh-B removal. This
template-activation method may broaden the potential applications
of core–shell structures for the construction of porous carbon
materials, which helps to resolve the related energy and environmental
issues.
