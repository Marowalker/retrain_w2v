Ethylene vinyl alcohol
copolymer (EVAL) membrane has great potential for applications in
protein separation and purification, but the uncontrollable distribution
of grafting location when membranes are modified by the grafting method
limits the membrane performance. Herein, an effective strategy for
controlling the distribution of grafting location was designed to
fabricate a high-performance EVAL membrane via photografting. The
UV intensity through the membranes was weakened when the local concentration
of the photoinitiator benzophenone (BP) on the topside of the membrane
increased; thus, the grafting location inside the EVAL membrane changed
from homogenous to asymmetric distribution based on the UV absorbability
of BP. The grafting inside the membrane pores can be promoted when
the loose and porous surface of the EVAL membrane was used as the
UV-facing side. More importantly, the varied distribution of grafting
location played different roles on improving the membrane performance.
For protein binding, the limited convection in the membrane bed was
avoided, and the desorption efficiency could be improved when the
grafting location enriched inside the membrane pores. For protein
filtration, the antifouling properties of the EVAL membrane were enhanced
when the grafting location enriched on the topside. This research
offers a novel approach to achieve controllable grafting location
distribution of membranes and provides a perspective to design the
high-performance EVAL membranes for protein separation.

Introduction
Surface grafting has been the effective
and feasible method for membrane modification.1 The durability and reversibility of membrane properties can be obtained
because the polymer chains are anchored onto the membrane by forming
a covalent bond, and membrane properties can be efficiently improved
due to the direct interaction between the substances and polymer chains.
A variety of strategies have been focused on the design of polymer
chains for improving the membrane properties, that is, chemical composition
and structure,2−4 grafting
density, height or thickness,5 topography
and morphological structure,6 conformation
and swelling,7,8 and polymerization kinetics.9,10 However, studies associated with the distribution of grafting location
have been rarely performed.

The modification location and distribution
inside the membrane have received more attention in recent years.11−17 Jiang and co-workers fabricated covalent organic-framework-based
hybrid membranes used for ethanol dehydration. The asymmetric distribution
of nanoparticles (majority of nanoparticles floated on the topside
of the membrane) was observed based on the slow evaporation of the
solvent, resulting in the enhanced surface hydrophilicity, high separation
factor, and permeation flux of the hybrid membranes.13 Chen and co-workers designed a poly(vinylidene fluoride)
composite membrane for catalytic reduction of p-nitrophenol.
The catalyst poly(methacrylic acid) microspheres coated by noble metal
nanoparticles were only within the membrane pores, and the catalytic
reaction was only carried out within the membrane pores; thus, the
product can be immediately isolated from the reactant.15 However, these investigations mainly focused
on the blending or coating method for preparing membranes; the grafting
strategies have not been exploited. This may be because the majority
of surface grafting is carried out in solution1; thus,
the grafting location in the membrane is more difficult to control.

Ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL), with excellent hydrophilicity
and biocompatibility, has become a novel biomedical material for fabricating
functional membranes.18,19 EVAL membranes have been used
in applications for protein purification and concentration. The proteins
usually have quite high molecular weight and aggregate easily; therefore,
the membrane performance may be impeded by the uncontrolled distribution
of polymer chains. For example, for membrane chromatography, the increased
grafting amount of polymer chains is conducive to improving the protein-binding
capacity, but the membrane pores of the topside are narrowed and even
blocked by increasing the grafting location on the topside; thus,
the convective flow in the adsorption process is limited.20,21 Meanwhile, for surface-only modified requirements, the intrinsic
permeability of membranes is also weakened due to the partial blocking
of the pore channels inside the membrane during the grafting process.5,22−24

Photografting is a useful and versatile technology for preparation
or modification of membranes due to its advantages, that is, low operation
cost, short reaction time, mild reaction conditions, and ease of industrialization.25−27 Photografting is generally considered
to occur primarily at the top outer surface of membranes,28,29 but a few studies found that grafting proceeded not only on the
top membrane surface but also to considerable depths into the membrane.30−32 In our previous work, a pH-responsive
membrane was prepared by grafting dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate
(DMAEMA) using simultaneous photografting,30,33 but
the grafting location distribution in the EVAL membrane was uncontrollable.

In this work, an effective strategy for manipulating the grafting
location distribution in the EVAL membrane was designed via sequential
photografting based on the UV absorbability of BP to improve the membrane
performance for protein separation. Meanwhile, the effect of surface
morphology of the UV-facing side on poly(DMAEMA) chain distribution
was also investigated. The distribution of poly(DMAEMA) chains on
the EVAL membrane external surfaces was examined by an attenuated
total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The distribution of poly(DMAEMA) chains
through the cross-section direction was confirmed via energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry (EDX) analysis. Moreover, the effects of grafting
location distribution on membrane properties (i.e., protein binding
and protein filtration) were also investigated.

Results and Discussion
Controllable
Grafting Location Distribution
Effect
of the UV Absorbability of BP
In preparation of the grafted
EVAL membrane, sequential photografting was used, which is shown in Scheme 1. The photoinitiator
BP was first precoated on the membrane surface and pore walls before
UV irradiation by a batch adsorption method to improve the grafting
efficiency. Second, the BP was functionalized on the membrane under
UV irradiation. The UV light cleaved the C–C bond of the BP
and the excited BP abstracted hydrogen atom from the membrane to form
surface radicals and semipinacol radicals. Then, the surface radicals
and semipinacol radicals combined together to generate surface initiators
in the absence of monomers. Third, the surface initiators decomposed
into surface radicals under UV irradiation, which reacted with the
DMAEMA monomer to generate grafted polymers on the existing grafting
location. Therefore, the BP functionalized location on the membrane
was crucial for controllable grafting location distribution.

Scheme 1 Schematic Diagram
of Sequential UV Irradiation Graft Polymerization
The light transmission through materials is often described by the
Lambert–Beer law. The efficiency of light transmission depends
on matrix effects, concentration of the attenuating species, and other
factors.31−33 BP is widely
utilized as UV filters, UV absorbers, and UV initiators because of
its unique characteristics of high triplet state energy, strong UV
absorption, and stable molecular structure.34,35 Therefore,
the local concentration of BP on the membrane surface may have potential
impacts on UV light transmission through the membrane.

The local
BP adsorbed amount on the membrane can be regulated by varying the CBP in the precoated process. The effect of CBP on BP adsorbed amount and transmittance of
UV light through the membrane is shown in Figure 1. The BP adsorbed amount linearly increased
by increasing the CBP in solution, suggesting
that the local concentration of BP on the membrane surface also increased.
The thickness of the EVAL membrane was approximate to 160 μm,
and the transmittance of UV light through the original EVAL membrane
was 3.43% due to light absorption or scattering of the EVAL membrane.
The transmittance of UV light through the BP adsorbed EVAL membrane
was dramatically decreased (from 3.43 to 0.19%) by increasing the CBP from 0 to 40 g/L and then decreased gently
from 0.17 to 0.08% when the CBP was higher
than 60 g/L. The decay of UV intensity on the backside of EVAL membranes
was attributed to the enhanced UV absorbability of BP when the local
concentration of BP on the membrane surface increased.

Figure 1 Effect of CBP on BP adsorbed amount and transmittance of UV light
through the EVAL membrane.

The BP
functionalized location on
the external surface (topside and backside) of membranes was measured
by diffuse reflectance UV–vis (DRUV), as shown in Figure 2a, and the diffuse
reflectance absorbance values are shown in Figure 2b. The peak at 260 nm was observed due to
the benzene ring of BP. The diffuse reflectance absorbance values
of BP on the topside increased as the CBP increased, but it was worth noting that the absorbance values of
BP on the backside of the membrane decreased. It may be due to the
enhanced UV absorbability of the BP when CBP was higher than 60 g/L as discussed above (Figure 1), and the UV intensity through the membranes
was weakened and resulted in less functionalized BP on the backside
of the membrane. As shown in Figure 2b, the diffuse reflectance absorbance values of BP
on the backside of the membrane were 0.226, 0.127, and 0.099, respectively,
when the CBP increased from 20 to 100
g/L. Therefore, the distribution of BP functionalized on the membrane
was significantly impacted by the local concentration of BP on the
membrane surface.

Figure 2 DRUV spectra and absorbance values
of the BP functionalized EVAL membrane by UV irradiation for 10 min
(a, b) and 20 min (c, d).

The absorbance values of BP on two sides of
the membrane were increased by increasing the BP UV-irradiated time
from 10 to 20 min (Figure 2c,d), but the BP functionalized distribution was not affected.
The increased absorbance values of
BP were attributed to more BP being functionalized on two sides of
the membrane by increasing the UV-irradiated time, but the BPs on
the topside and backside were probably activated simultaneously, and
thus the BP functionalized distribution had no obvious change.

After BP functionalization, the DMAEMA was grafted from the EVAL
membrane. The BP functionalized amount and DMAEMA GD calculated based
on the weight method are shown in Figure 3. When the BP UV-irradiated time was 10 min,
the BP functionalized amount of the membrane was increased from 0.16
to 0.20 μmol/cm2 by increasing the CBP from 20 to 60 g/L, indicating that more BP was functionalized
on the membrane surface. However, when the CBP was higher than 60 g/L, the BP functionalized amount (0.21
μmol/cm2) changed slowly because the BP functionalized
sites on the membrane surface approached saturation. The BP functionalized
amount calculated by the weight method was in exact accordance with
that obtained by DRUV spectra. The BP functionalized amount and the
GD of the membrane were both increased by increasing the UV-irradiated
time. The original and poly(DMAEMA)-grafted EVAL membranes prepared
with CBP values of 20, 60, and 100 g/L
were designated as EVAL0, EVAL20g/L, EVAL60g/L, and EVAL100g/L, respectively.

Figure 3 Effect of CBP on BP functionalized
amount and DMAEMA GD of the membrane (DMAEMA grafting time 20 min).

The distribution
of poly(DMAEMA) chains on the topside and backside of membranes EVAL0, EVAL20g/L, EVAL60g/L, and EVAL100g/L was determined by FT-IR (Figure 4). Compared with EVAL0, the bands
at 1726 cm–1 were observed of membranes EVAL20g/L, EVAL60g/L, and EVAL100g/L, which
correspond to the stretching vibration of the carbonyl stretching
(C=O) of poly(DMAEMA) chains. The results showed that the poly(DMAEMA)
chains had been grafted onto the EVAL membrane successfully. The poly(DMAEMA)-grafted
chains of membrane EVAL20g/L were observed on both the
topside and backside. For membranes EVAL60g/L and EVAL100g/L, the poly(DMAEMA) chains were mainly enriched on the
topside of the membrane. The results indicated that the obvious difference
of grafting location distribution was observed on the external membrane
surface of the EVAL membrane.

EVAL0, EVAL20g/L, EVAL60g/L, and
EVAL100g/L (GD 0.9 μmol/cm2).

The XPS spectra of membranes give
further evidence for the controllable distribution of grafted chains,
and the results are shown in Figure 5. The surface elemental mole percentages of the membranes
are shown in Table 1. The nitrogen (N) peaks (N 1s) were clearly observed at 402.1 eV
(C 1s) for grafted membranes EVAL20g/L, EVAL60g/L, and EVAL100g/L, which resulted from the typical groups
on poly(DMAEMA) chains. Moreover, the poly(DMAEMA) chains were observed
on both the topside and backside of membrane EVAL20g/L.
The N contents on the topside
and backside of membrane EVAL20g/L were 3.1 and 2.4%, respectively.
In contrast, the poly(DMAEMA) chains were observed mainly on the topside
of membranes EVAL60g/L and EVAL100g/L, which
was in good accordance with the FT-IR analysis. The N contents on
the topside of membranes EVAL60g/L and EVAL100g/L increased to 4.7 and 4.4%, and the N contents on the backside decreased
to 1.1 and 1.2%, respectively.

The surface and cross-section
morphologies of membranes EVAL0, EVAL20g/L,
EVAL60g/L, and EVAL100g/L in Figure 6 show the morphological changes
of membranes after grafting. The asymmetric structure of EVAL membranes
was observed, including a separation layer on the topside of the membrane,
a fingerlike middle laye r, and a spongelike bottom layer. The membrane
pore size on the topside was 0.1–0.2 μm, and the membrane
pore size on the backside was 1.0–2.0 μm. From the topside
images, it can be found that the membrane surface became rougher after
grafting, but the porosity was retained. The morphology on the topside
changed obviously by increasing the CBP from 20 to 60 g/L, but it hardly changed when the CBP was increased to 100 g/L. The morphology on the backside
of membrane EVAL20g/L changed slightly, but there was almost
no change between those of membranes EVAL60g/L (EVAL100g/L) and EVAL0.

Figure 6 FE-SEM images of the
original and poly(DMAEMA)-grafted EVAL membranes (GD 0.9 μmol/cm2).

The determination of the
grafting location distribution through the cross-section direction
of membranes was also achieved by EDX analysis. The CrO42– anion was adsorbed on the poly(DMAEMA)-grafted
chains by electrostatic interactions to achieve higher sensitivity
for EDX.6,34 The distribution of Cr element on the membrane
surface and cross section was measured for indirect evidence of the
grafting location. The measuring regions of the membrane are shown
in Figure 6, and the
scan areas of the membrane surface and cross section were 400 and
800 μm2, respectively. The measuring regions of the
cross section included near the topside (region 1), the middle of
the cross section (region 2), and near the backside (region 3). The
Cr content is shown in Table 2, and the errors of Cr content are about ±0.20. The Cr
content of EVAL0 was observed due to the nonspecific adsorption
of the EVAL material, but the values of all regions were low. The
Cr content of all regions of the membrane EVAL20g/L was
obviously increased than that of EVAL0, suggesting that
the poly(DMAEMA) chains were homogenously distributed on the external
membrane surfaces and inside the membrane pores. The Cr content on
the topside was higher than that of the other regions because the
topside was used as the UV-facing side during grafting. For EVAL60g/L, the Cr content of the topside was significantly increased,
which was a 2.2-fold increase relative to EVAL20g/L and
a 9.3-fold increase relative to EVAL0. However, it was
noteworthy that the Cr contents of the backside and cross section
of the membrane EVAL60g/L were obviously decreased, and
for EVAL100g/L, the Cr content of all regions was approximate
to that of EVAL60g/L. These results indicated that the
poly(DMAEMA) chains were mainly grafted on the topside of membranes
when CBP was higher than 60 g/L.

Therefore, the difference of grafting location distribution could
be observed not only on the external surface but also within the membrane
pores based on UV absorbability of BP. As shown in Scheme 2, the local BP concentration
on the topside of the membrane was increased by increasing the CBP in the precoated process. The UV absorbability
of BP on the topside increased and the UV intensity through the membranes
was weakened; thus, the graft polymerization in the membrane pores
and on the backside was limited. The grafting location inside the
EVAL membrane changed from homogenous to asymmetric distribution by
increasing the local BP concentration on the topside of the membrane.

Distribution
of Grafting Location Based on the UV Absorbability of BP
Effect of Pore Structure on Membrane
Surface
The UV intensity through the membranes played an
important role on the controllable distribution of grafting location
and was heavily influenced by the pore structure on the UV-facing
side of membranes. The FE-SEM results (Figure 6) showed a typical asymmetrical structure
of EVAL membranes, and the surface morphology of the two sides of
EVAL membranes was different. The topside of EVAL membranes was dense,
and the membrane pore size was 0.1–0.2 μm, whereas the
backside of EVAL membranes was loose and porous, and the membrane
pore size was 1.0–2.0 μm, which may be favorable to promoting
the grafting inside the membrane pores. Thus, the topside and backside
of EVAL membranes were used as the UV-facing side to compare the grafting
location distribution, which was designed as EVAL-T and EVAL-B, respectively.

The results of DRUV, FT-IR, and XPS spectra and atomic force microscopy
(AFM) images indicated that the obvious difference of grafting location
distribution was also obtained on the external membrane surface of
the EVAL membrane (Figures S1–S3). From the results of EDX analysis (Table 3), the Cr content of the UV-facing side (topside
of membrane EVAL-T and backside of membrane EVAL-B) was significantly
higher than the other measuring regions, and both increased by increasing
GD, indicating that the poly(DMAEMA) chains were mainly distributed
on the UV-facing side of the membrane at CBP 60 g/L. For membrane EVAL-T, the Cr content on the topside and “region
1” was obviously increased as GD increased, whereas the Cr
contents of other measuring regions (“regions 2 and 3”
and backside) were slightly increased, indicating that the increase
of grafted chains occurred on the topside and near the topside. However,
for membrane EVAL-B, the grafted chains on the porous side (UV-facing
side) increased obviously, but the grafted chains of “region
3” just gently increased, and the grafted chains of “region
1” and “region 2” all increased, indicating more
poly(DMAEMA) chains were enriched within the membrane pores. This
was attributed to the pore structure (1.0–2.0 μm) on
the backside of the EVAL membrane, which improved the passage of UV
light into the pores and contributed to the grafting inside the pores.
Therefore, a simple strategy for fabricating the EVAL membrane with
the grafting location distributed on the backside and inside of the
membrane pores can be obtained through using the backside of the EVAL
membrane as the UV-facing side (Scheme 3).

The distribution of grafted chains inside
the pores of EVAL-B was further examined by EDX analysis. The Cr content
on the surface of the backside and within the membrane pores of EVAL-B
is shown in Figure 7. The Cr content of EVAL0, both on the surface and inside
the pores, was lower than 0.5 wt %. The Cr content on the surface
and inside the pores of the grafted membranes was both observed and
increased by increasing GD, indicating that the poly(DMAEMA) chains
were both grafted on the surface and within the pores. Notably, the
Cr content within the pores was much higher than the values observed
from “region 3” but close to those observed from the
backside of EVAL-B. Compared with “region 3”, the measuring
region inside the membrane pores was directly faced to the UV light;
thus, more grafted sites were generated rather than the region perpendicular
to the UV light.

Membrane Performance
Permeability
The water fluxes of
membranes (GD 0.9 and 1.8 μmol/cm2) in the pH range
of 3.2–10.3 are shown in Figure 8. The EVAL membrane with homogenous distribution of
grafting location was designed as EVAL-N. For the unmodified membrane
EVAL0, the water flux has nearly no change for all pH values.
Compared with the membrane EVAL0, the water fluxes of membranes
EVAL-T, EVAL-B, and EVAL-N showed significantly pH-dependent characteristic.
The fluxes of membranes EVAL-T, EVAL-B, and EVAL-N (GD 0.9 and 1.8
μmol/cm2) at alkaline conditions were almost at the
same level, and then the fluxes of the EVAL membrane with GD 0.9 μmol/cm2 decreased rapidly by decreasing the pH from 9.3 to 4.3, which
was resulted from the conformational change of poly(DMAEMA) chains.
When the pH is lower than the pKa (about
8.0–9.0), the poly(DMAEMA) chains are protonated and swollen,
thereby decreasing the effective pore size of the membrane. In contrast,
the poly(DMAEMA)-grafted chains are deprotonated and lead to an increased
pore size of the membrane. However, the fluxes of the EVAL membrane
with higher GD (1.8 μmol/cm2) decreased sharply in
a narrower pH range (from 9.3 to 6.2), and the lower fluxes at acidic
condition were observed, which was because the variation of the effective
membrane pore sizes based on pH changes could be enhanced by increasing
the GD. Note that the pH-dependent permeability
showed no obvious differences of EVAL-T, EVAL-B, and EVAL-N with nearly
identical GD but different distributions of poly(DMAEMA) chains, demonstrating
that permeation resistance through the membranes was generated from
the all-transmission path of the entire membrane matrix. Thus, it
can be concluded that
the “pore size” used for evaluating the membrane performance
refers to the mean pore size, which is obtained from the all-pass-through
pores in the membrane.

Figure 8 pH-dependent permeability
of membranes EVAL0, EVAL-T, EVAL-B, and EVAL-N.

Dynamic Protein
Binding
Membrane chromatography has been increasingly applied
in biomolecule recovery and purification. EVAL membranes have been
used as a substance of membrane absorbers because of their high hydrophilicity
and biocompatibility. Convection is the significant advantage of membrane
chromatography, but it is always limited when the grafting amount
of polymer chains increased. Thus, it is necessary to investigate
the influence of grafting location distribution on the binding properties
of membranes for breaking the trade-off between permeability and binding
ability.

As shown in Figure 9, the dynamic adsorption and desorption curves of EVAL-T,
EVAL-N, and EVAL-B were evaluated. The pKa of DMAEMA is about 8.0–9.0, and the isoelectric point of
BSA is 4.7–4.8.35 The BSA molecules
bind to the poly(DMAEMA) chain due to electrostatic adsorption at
pH 6.4, and the static adsorption capability of the EVAL membrane
with GD 1.8 μmol/cm2 was 102.6 mg/g.33 In the initial part of the adsorption process, the protein
concentrations in the effluent of membranes EVAL-T, EVAL-N, and EVAL-B
were all approximated to zero, indicating most of the BSA molecules
bound to the membrane bed. As the membrane bed capacity was reached,
unadsorbed BSA molecules began to break through. The protein concentrations
in the effluent of membranes EVAL-B and EVAL-N after the adsorption
process reached 95% and 78%, respectively, but that of EVAL-T was
only 52%.

Figure 9 Effect of grafting
location distribution on BSA binding
of EVAL membranes (GD 1.8 μmol/cm2).

After the adsorption process, the binding buffer was
used to rinse the bed until a stable baseline was observed. The mass
of protein bound to the membrane bed was calculated from the difference
between the mass of protein injected and in the unadsorbed peaks.
The adsorption capabilities of membranes EVAL-B and EVAL-N were 94.4
and 98.7 mg/g, respectively, which approached the static adsorption
capability. However, the adsorption capability of membrane EVAL-T
(133.3 mg/g) was much higher than the static adsorption capability,
suggesting that part of the BSA molecules were rejected in the adsorption
process. This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that when
grafting locations (adsorption sites) enrich on the topside of the
membrane, the BSA mainly adsorbed on the topside, and thus the pore
channels on the topside were narrower and even blocked, leading to
the BSA rejection.

In the elution process, the bound BSA molecules
were released from the membrane bed at pH 3.6 due to the charge repulsion.
The protein recovery was calculated as the quotient of the mass of
BSA in the eluted protein peak to the mass of protein bound to the
membrane bed, multiplied by 100%. The BSA molecules bound to the membrane
EVAL-B were eluted rapidly, and the concentration was a 1.9-fold increase
relative to the feed concentration. The grafting location of EVAL-B
was mainly distributed in the membrane pores, and thus BSA mainly
adsorbed in membrane pores. Based on the FE-SEM images, the pore sizes
inside the membrane and on the backside were larger than those on
the topside; therefore, the path for feed flow can be retained after
BSA adsorption. Moreover, the adsorption sites of EVAL-B were close
to the outlet of the filtration cell, and thus the desorbed BSA could
be collected more rapidly. The elution peak of EVAL-N was also observed
despite the peak being broader. The protein recoveries of EVAL-B and
EVAL-N were 94.0 and 92.3%, respectively. However, the elution peak
of EVAL-T was not observed, and the protein recovery was lower than
20%, indicating that it was difficult for the desorbed BSA to pass
through the membrane.

All the above results indicated that the
protein-binding performance of membranes is markedly related with
the difference of grafting location (adsorption sites) distribution.
When the grafting location enriches on the topside, the convective
flow in the dynamic adsorption and desorption process is limited,
resulting in low working efficiency of protein binding. In contrast,
when the grafting location enriches inside the membrane pores, the
convection in the membrane bed is retained, and moreover, the desorption
efficiency could be improved.

Antifouling
in Protein Filtration
EVAL membranes are always used for
protein concentration by membrane filtration. A major problem in ultrafiltration
and microfiltration is the performance degradation due to membrane
fouling. To investigate the antifouling properties of the EVAL membranes,
three-step filtration operations were conducted, and the experimental
details are provided in the experimental section. The relative flux
was used because of the obvious difference of permeability of membranes
at different pH values, which has been shown in Figure 8. The time-dependent relative flux curves
of membranes at pH 3.6, 4.8, 6.4, and 10.0 were investigated, and
the results are shown in Figure 10. Importantly, based on the data of XPS, the content
of polar group of EVAL membranes was approximate, suggesting the similar
surface hydrophilicity.

relative
flux curves of EVAL membranes during BSA filtration at pH 3.6 (a),
4.8 (b), 6.4 (c), and 10.0 (d) (GD 1.8 μmol/cm2).

From Figure 10a, the relative fluxes of membranes EVAL-T,
EVAL-B, and EVAL-N at pH 3.6 all decreased slightly when the pH was
changed to 3.6, and the flux recovery was higher than 90% after washing
with PBS, which means the low protein fouling caused by the electrostatic
repulsion between BSA and poly(DMAEMA) chains.

was changed to BSA solution with pH 4.8 (Figure 10b), the relative fluxes of EVAL-T decreased
consecutively from 0.94 to 0.36 during the entire BSA permeation process,
and higher than 70% relative fluxes were recovered after simply washing
by PBS. By contrast, the relative fluxes of EVAL-B sharply decreased
to 0.33 in the initial part of BSA permeation, and the flux recovery
of EVAL-B was obviously lower than those of EVAL-T and EVAL-N. It
can be ascribed to high protein adsorption and deposition onto the
membrane surface and pore walls as a result of hydrophobic interactions
at this pH (pKa of BSA). Furthermore,
it was observed that the fouling inside the membrane pores played
a more important role on the deterioration of permeability during
protein filtration.

The results were future verified
by the results at pH 6.4 and 10.0 (Figure 10c,d). The relative fluxes of EVAL-T decreased
consecutively during the entire BSA permeation process, and those
of EVAL-B markedly decreased in the initial part of BSA permeation.
Meanwhile, the flux recovery of EVAL-T was higher than those of EVAL-N
and EVAL-B, and the flux recovery of EVAL-B was the lowest, which
was consistent with the results observed at pH 4.8. In a word, the
antifouling properties could be improved when the grafting location
enriches on the topside. This may be attributed to more protein accumulation
on the membrane surface rather than inside the membrane pores when
the grafting location enriches on the topside; thus, it could be removed
by hydraulic cleaning more easily. In contrast, the irreversible fouling
increased when the grafting location enriches inside the membrane
pores, which was caused by the protein deposition inside the membrane
pores.

Conclusions
In summary, an effective strategy for controlling the distribution
of grafting location was designed to fabricate a high-performance
EVAL membrane. The pH-responsive DMAEMA was grafted onto the EVAL
membrane using sequential photografting, and the grafting location
was controlled based on UV absorbability of the photoinitiator. The
transmittance of UV light through the BP-coated EVAL membrane was
dramatically decreased to lower than 0.17% when CBP was higher than 60 g/L. The photografting in the membrane
pores and on the backside was limited due to the enhanced UV absorbability
of BP. The grafting location inside the EVAL membrane changed from
homogenous to asymmetric distributions by increasing the CBP. The topside and backside of the membrane were used
as the modified side that was exposed to UV irradiation. By increasing
GD, the poly(DMAEMA) chains were mainly increased on or close to the
topside when the topside was used as the UV-facing side, whereas the
poly(DMAEMA) chains were increased on the backside and inside the
membrane pores when the backside was used as the UV-facing side. Moreover,
the varied distribution of grafting location played different roles
on the EVAL membrane performance. For protein binding, the convection
in the membrane bed was retained and the desorption efficiency could
be improved when the grafting location enriched inside the membrane
pores. For protein filtration, the antifouling properties of the EVAL
membrane were enhanced when the grafting location enriched on the
topside.

Materials and Methods
Materials
EVAL (ethylene content 44 mol
%) was purchased from Kuraray (Japan). Dimethysulfoxide (DMSO) was
purchased from Kemiou Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd. (China), which was
used as the EVAL solvent. 1-octanol, which was employed as a nonsolvent
additive, was purchased from Guangfu Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd. (China).
DMAEMA (98%) was obtained from J&K Chemicals (Beijing, China)
and distilled before usage under reduced pressure. BP was purchased
from TCI (Shanghai, China), and BSA (molecular weight of 68 kDa) was
sourced from Sigma-Aldrich. The hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), sodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4),
sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4), and potassium
chromate (K2CrO4) were of analytical reagent
grade and purchased from Guangfu Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd. (China).

Preparation of Poly(DMAEMA)-Grafted EVAL
Membrane
The original EVAL membrane was prepared by the phase
inversion method,33 and the grafted EVAL
membrane was prepared by grafting DMAEMA using sequential photografting.36−38 A UV illumination system equipped
with one high-pressure mercury lamp (400 W with a main transmitting
wavelength of 365 nm) was used. The UV intensity of 365 nm was measured
by a UVA meter from the photoelectric instrument factory of Beijing
Normal University. Transmittance of UV light was defined as the ratios
of UV intensity on the topside to backside of the membrane, multiplied
by 100%.

The preparation process is elaborated as follows. First,
the EVAL membrane was dried after washing by ethanol for 24 h to remove
the impurities and additives. Afterward, the EVAL membrane with an
area of 28.3 cm2 was immersed in 30 mL of acetone solution
with a certain initial BP concentration (CBP) for 3 h to precoat the photoinitiator BP on the membrane surface
and pore walls. Second, the membrane was dried and UV irradiated (5
mW/cm2) under N2 atmosphere for a predetermined
time. After that, the membrane was washed with acetone for at least
5 times to remove redundant BP. Third, the BP functionalized membrane
was immersed in DMAEMA solution to UV irradiate under N2 atmosphere for 20 min and then washed with alcohol and HCl solution
(pH 2.0) for at least 5 times to remove the redundant monomers and
homopolymers. The BP adsorbed amount (mg/g), BP functionalized amount
(μmol/cm2), and grafting degree (GD) (μmol/cm2) of membranes were calculated as follows: 1   2   3  where m0, m1, m2,
and m are the weights of the original, BP adsorbed,
BP functionalized, and grafted membrane, respectively. S is the surface area of the EVAL membrane. MWBP (182.2
g/mol) and MWDMA (157.2 g/mol) are the molecular weights
of BP and DMAEMA, respectively.

The effect of CBP (20, 60, and 100 g/L) and morphology of the UV-facing
side (the topside or backside of the membrane) on the distribution
of grafted chains were investigated.

Characterization of Membranes
The solid-state diffuse reflectance
UV–vis (DRUV) spectra were measured on a Purkinje General TU-1901
spectrophotometer, which was fitted with an integrating sphere (China),
to examine the BP functionalization on the EVAL membrane.

FT-IR
spectroscopy (TENSOR37, Bruker AXS) and XPS (K-Aepna, Thermo Fisher,
UK) were also employed to characterize the chemical composition of
the membranes. FE-SEM (S4800, Hitachi, Japan) was used to investigate
the membrane morphology. The grafting location distribution on the
membrane surface and inside the membrane pores was examined by an
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX) employing the FE-SEM with
a 20 kV energy beam.

pH-Responsive
Permeability
The permeability of the membranes was determined
by measuring the water flux of membranes at different pH values. The
measurement was conducted on a home-made cross-flow filtration cell
at a transmembrane pressure of 0.05 MPa. The pH of the solution was
adjusted by HCl and NaOH. The pH values in the solution were measured
using a pH meter (EL20, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland).

Dynamic Adsorption and Desorption
Dynamic
adsorption and desorption of membranes were measured using a custom-made
dead-end filtration cell. The internal volume of the test cell was
5.6 mL, and the effective membrane area was 9 cm2. Three
membranes were loaded into the stack holder to form a membrane stack.
The feed-side pressure was maintained by a peristaltic pump (BT100-2J,
Baoding Longer Precision Pump Co., Ltd.), and the protein filtration
was conducted at constant flux mode.

PBS values with pH 6.4
and 3.6 were used as adsorption and desorption buffers, respectively.
The protocol for a single run was as follows: (1) PBS 6.4 was initially
used to fill the cell and equilibrate membranes, (2) 0.6 mg/mL BSA
solution was loaded through the stack holder at the constant flow
rate of 3.8 L/(m2·h), (3) unadsorbed BSA was washed
from the membrane bed with PBS 6.4, and (4) bounded BSA was eluted
with PBS 3.6 until a stable baseline was observed. Between each run,
the cell was emptied and filled the solution of the subsequent run.
The permeate solution was collected, and the BSA concentration was
measured by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UL2100, GE) with UV
detection at 280 nm.

Antifouling during
BSA Filtration
The BSA filtrations of membranes at 3.6, 4.8,
6.4, and 10.0 were investigated by cross-flow filtration at constant
pressure (0.05 MPa) mode. First, PBS with different pHs was passed
through the membranes for 20 min; second, the feed was replaced with
1 g/L BSA solution; third, the membranes were washed with the identical
PBS solution, and the fluxes after washing were remeasured. The relative
flux, which was defined as the relative percentage of real-time flux
to the initial water flux, was used to measure the flux changes with
time during the BSA filtration process.
