In this work, we report the stabilization
of the reduced states
of pyromellitic diimide by charge-balancing the imide radical anions
with cationic pyridinium groups attached to the aromatic core. This
structural modification is confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
analysis. Characterization by (spectro)electrochemical experiments
and computations reveal that the addition of cationic groups to an
already electron-deficient ring system results in up to +0.57 V shifts
in reduction potentials, largely as a consequence of charge screening
and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital-lowering effects. This formal
charge-balancing approach to stabilizing the reduced states of electron-deficient
pyromellitic diimides will facilitate their incorporation into spin-based
optoelectronic materials and devices.

Introduction
Organic radical systems
have been the subject of intense research
because of their potential in spin-based applications.1−8 Aromatic diimides are a class of organic compounds that undergo
reversible reduction processes to reach radical anion and dianion
states1,9−11 with absorption properties
that are attractive for energy storage12−14 and light-harvesting
applications.15−18 The smallest of aromatic diimides, pyromellitic diimide (PMDI),
has received significantly less attention in these areas than the
larger naphthalene and perylene diimides despite exhibiting promising
behavior in electronic settings14,19 alongside interesting
absorption and emission characteristics.9,20 Explanations
for this disparity often point to the challenge of incorporating functionalities
at the PMDI core positions21 and the more
negative voltages required by PMDI-based redox systems to reach their
reduced states.11,22 With these perceived limitations
in mind, we sought to demonstrate a molecular design that leads to
significant shifts of PMDI reduction potentials toward more positive
voltages. We hypothesized that utilizing cations to neutralize the
formal negative charges that form upon PMDI reduction would be a viable
approach for achieving the desired changes in reduction potentials.

Despite the wealth of literature on aromatic diimides, there are
only two reports of aromatic diimides that have been core-modified
with positively charged groups. In 2014, Mukhopadhyay et al. demonstrated23 phosphonium-appended naphthalene diimide radical
species with remarkable stability against oxidation because of bonding
interactions between the phosphonium site and the neighboring imide
carbonyl oxygen atom. Shortly afterward, Würthner et al. described24 the serendipitous formation of a zwitterionic
radical perylene diimide that is stable under ambient conditions.

With these precedents in mind, we envisioned that cationic groups
could be introduced onto the smaller PMDI core by a nucleophilic aromatic
substitution (NAS) reaction between an appropriately selected nucleophile
and a mono- or dibrominated PMDI precursor, a motif that has seen
a resurgence in research interest by us and others in recent years.20,21,25−29 The PMDI core, however, is thought to be more difficult
to substitute than the core positions of naphthalene and perylene
diimides because it is flanked by sterically demanding imide carbonyl
groups. We found that relatively nucleophilic compound 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine
(DMAP) was suitable for the desired NAS reactions with PMDIs. Herein,
we describe the synthesis and characterization of PMDIs that have
been mono- and bis-functionalized with 4-(dimethylamino)pyridinium
units.

Results and Discussion
The syntheses of the cationic
PMDIs entailed four steps from commercially
available compounds. Pyromellitic diimide precursors Br-PMDI and Br2-PMDI were
obtained from mono- and dibromodurene, respectively, by exhaustive
KMnO4 oxidation, acetic anhydride-mediated dehydration,20,28 and imidization with 2,6-diisopropylaniline. The control PMDI compound
(P) with no core modifications was also synthesized by
imidization of pyromellitic dianhydride (see the Supporting Information). Initial trials for the NAS reaction
between the brominated PMDIs and DMAP were conducted in refluxing
polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,4-dioxane, and PhCN.
In all cases, however, reaction times over 48 h were required to achieve
isolable yields. We found that syntheses could be completed much more
quickly under microwave conditions (1 h at 135 °C in THF), most
likely as a consequence of the higher temperatures and pressures accessible
by microwave reactors (Figure 1). The bromide salt of the monocationic DMAP+-functionalized
PMDI (1·Br) could not be precipitated
from the reaction mixture; thus, it was directly converted to its
PF6 form 1·PF6 by anion exchange with KPF6 in MeOH/H2O (2:3, v/v) in 60% overall yield. Difunctionalized salt 2·2Br, however, was essentially insoluble
in THF, which facilitated its separation from any partially reacted
monocationic intermediates by trituration of the crude product with
additional THF. Anion exchange was conducted in the same manner as
described previously to obtain 2·2PF6 in 65% overall yield.

Figure 1 Syntheses of (a) 1·PF6 and (b) 2·2PF6.

Slow evaporation of solutions of 1·PF6 in MeCN yielded single
crystals of sufficient
quality to be analyzed by X-ray diffraction (Figure 2). The dihedral angle between the central
benzene ring of PMDI and the appended DMAP+ group (54.2(5)°)
arises as a consequence of the steric demands of the flanking imide
carbonyls. This angle closely matches that observed for the energy-minimized
geometry of 1·PF6 obtained through gas phase density functional theory (DFT)
calculations (see below). The C–NMe2 bond in 1·PF6 (1.339(5)
Å) is shorter than the analogous bond in DMAP (1.363(1) Å,
CCDC BUKJOG11), and its torsion angle is only 11.1(6)°, suggesting
that conjugation between the pyridinium and the dimethylamino groups
leads the pyridinium to exhibit some quinoidal character. The PF6– anion appears to be involved in weak anion−π
interactions with the PMDI core, with average F-to-benzene ring plane
distances of 3.03 Å.

of the solid-state
structure of 1·PF6 obtained through X-ray diffraction analysis. C = gray, H =
white, F = green, N = blue, O = red, and P = orange.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments (1 mM compound
and 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in dimethylformamide (DMF),
100 mV/s, internal
ferrocene (Fc)/Fc+ reference) were conducted on 1+ and 22+ to assess how their reduction potentials differed in comparison
to those of the analogous unfunctionalized PMDI (P),
which is well-known to exhibit two reversible one-electron reduction
processes (Figure 3, top). Two reduction processes were observed for both 1+ and 22+, with the first reduction of 22+ taking place at a potential even more positive than that of the
analogous processes in larger naphthalene and perylene diimides.1 The reversibility of these processes was demonstrated
by the clean reoxidation scans in the CV and the symmetry of reduction
peaks observed using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) (Figure S1). No oxidation processes were observed
for either compound when scanning to more positive potentials.

voltammograms of P, 1+, and 22+ recorded (1
mM compound in DMF, 0.1 M Bu4NPF6, 100 mV/s,
Fc standard). (Bottom) Summary of E1/2 and ΔE1/2 values.

Substantial shifts toward more positive reduction
potentials in 1+ and 22+ provided insight into the stabilization
mechanisms at play
in these cationic PMDIs. Compared to those of P, the
first reduction processes of 1+ and 22+ were shifted toward
more positive potentials by 146 and 355 mV, respectively, suggesting
an approximately linear relationship between the amount of positive
charge and the extent of radical anion stabilization. Furthermore,
the difference between the first and second reduction potentials (ΔE = E11/2 – E21/2) became smaller when more positive
charge was present at the PMDI core (Figure 3, bottom). In the most drastic case, there
was a +566 mV shift in the second reduction potential of 22+ relative to that of P. These
data suggest that the radical anion stabilization observed in these
cationic PMDI compounds can be attributed to (1) overall lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO)-lowering effects of electron-deficient groups
(positive shifts in both E1/2 values)
and (2) charge screening between redox sites (decreased ΔE values).

It is important to note that these conclusions
were reached under
the assumption that the pyridinium groups themselves do not undergo
reduction processes at these potentials. This assumption is backed
by ample literature evidence that, unlike easily reduced 4,4′-bipyridinium
derivatives,5,30,31 DMAP+-polysubstituted arenes and quinones undergo reductions
at far more negative voltages and that these reductions are often
irreversible in nature.32,33

To further probe
the validity of this assumption and investigate
the electronic structure of the cationic PMDIs, DFT calculations (Figure 4) with the M06-2X
functional at the 6-31G(d) level of theory were performed on the N,N′-dimethyl analogues of P, 1+, and 22+ in the gas phase. Much like the solid-state
structures obtained through single-crystal X-ray diffraction, the
sterically demanding imide groups force the DMAP+ units
to twist at 52.5 and 55.8° dihedral angles to the PMDI benzene
ring in 1+ and 22+, respectively. In both molecules, the
LUMO is localized exclusively on the PMDI core, whereas the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is distributed largely on the DMAP+ units, an observation which shows that the pyridiniums are
unlikely to be participating in the reduction chemistry. The HOMO
and LUMO energies in 1+ and 22+ are both lower than they are in P, with the overall narrowing of the HOMO–LUMO gap
being driven by the more significant decrease in LUMO energies.

Figure 4 Depictions
of the HOMO (red/blue) and LUMO (green/yellow) of P, 1+, and 22+ obtained through DFT calculations on their N,N′-dimethyl analogues (M06-2X/6-31G(d),
isovalue = 0.03). Relative energies of the HOMOs and LUMOs are provided
in electronvolts.

The absorption features
of the cationic PMDIs and their reduced
states were investigated to identify further implications of pyridinium
incorporation near imide redox sites. In their unreduced forms, 1+ and 22+ have absorption maxima at 317 and 336 nm, respectively, that
can be attributed to the extended delocalization of the dimethylamine
lone pair in the DMAP+ units (Figure S2). The red shift that is observed with increasing DMAP+ substitution corresponds well with the decreasing HOMO–LUMO
gaps predicted by computation (Figure 4). A slight red shift in absorption was observed for 22+ in going from CH2Cl2 to DMF as the solvent, with absorption maxima observed at
326 and 336 nm, respectively (Figure S3). The singly and doubly reduced states of 1+ and 22+ could
be separately accessed by bulk electrochemical reduction in DMF solution
with 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 as the electrolyte (Figure 5). The absorption
profiles of singly reduced states 1• and 2•+ are similar to those of the
radical anion form of unfunctionalized N,N′-dioctyl-PMDI (Q, λmax = 718 nm),9 with strong absorption bands
centered at around 720 nm arising from π*−π* transitions
that are commonly observed for carbonyl anion radicals.34 The higher-energy but weakly absorbing bands
at 525 nm observed for 1• and 2•+ are likely related to π–π*
transitions that were predicted but not observed for Q•–.9

The doubly reduced states of the DMAP+-functionalized
PMDIs (1(2•)– and 22•) differ from those of Q2(•−),
which absorbs significantly more intensely at 552 nm. In 1(2•)–, there are two distinct
absorption bands of similar intensity at 487 and 531 nm in addition
to a weaker broad absorption band centered at 852 nm. For neutral 22• on the other hand, only
a single absorption band is observed at 492 nm. This band is blue-shifted
by 60 nm compared with the analogous feature found for Q2(•−).9 These data show that unlike those of the singly reduced states the
photophysical properties of the doubly reduced states are perturbed
by the DMAP+ functionalization. This perturbation likely
occurs in 1(2•)– and 22• because the lower-energy molecular
orbital involved in these electronic transitions is localized to the
DMAP+ unit rather than the PMDI core, much like the HOMOs
of their oxidized forms (Figure 4).

Conclusions
In summary, we have
demonstrated the successful mono- and bis-functionalization
of the pyromellitic diimide core with 4-(dimethylamino)pyridinium
groups through a facile nucleophilic aromatic substitution approach.
By appending these cationic groups to the electron-deficient aromatic
ring, the redox activity of the imide functional groups can be shifted
by over +0.5 V. The various redox states of the cationic compounds
all display strong absorption characteristics that correlate well
with the features observed in the parent compound. Taken together,
these results provide concrete evidence that the addition of formal
charge is an effective strategy for modulating the electronic and
optical properties of aromatic diimides.

and rendered using POV-Ray.

Preparation of 1·PF6
Reaction setup: An oven-dried
microwave vial (0.5–2 mL size, Biotage #352016) equipped with
a magnetic stir bar was charged with Br-PMDI (50 mg,
81 μmol, 1 equiv) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (9.9 mg, 81
μmol, 1 equiv) and then sealed with a septum cap. The vial was
subjected to three vacuum and Ar backfill cycles, after which anhydrous
THF (2 mL) was added to the vial. The reaction mixture was then heated
in a Biotage Initiator+ microwave reactor for 1 h at 135 °C. Workup and purification: The reaction mixture was cooled
to room temperature. The solids were collected by vacuum filtration
and subsequently rinsed with MeOH to extract the product from unreacted
starting material. Anion exchange was achieved by adding saturated
KPF6 in MeOH/H2O (2:3, v/v) to the combined
THF and MeOH filtrates until no further precipitation was observed.
The precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration, rinsed with deionized
(DI) water, and dried in a vacuum oven (60 °C, 230 mbar). The
resultant yellow solids were found to be 1·PF6 (39 mg, 49 μmol, 60% yield). Characterization: 1H NMR (400 MHz, (CD3)2CO) δ 8.68 (s, 1H), 8.53 (d, 3J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.53 (t, 3JAX2 = 7.8 Hz, 2H), 7.40 (d, 3JAX2 = 7.8 Hz, 4H), 7.30 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 3.49 (s, 6H), 2.82 (hept, 3J = 6.9 Hz, 4H), 1.15 (d, 3J = 6.9 Hz, 12H), 1.13 (d, 3J = 6.9 Hz,

Preparation of 2·2PF6
Reaction setup: An oven-dried
microwave vial (10–20 mL size, Biotage #354833) equipped with
a magnetic stir bar was charged with Br2-PMDI (500 mg, 0.720 mmol, 1 equiv) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine
(352 mg, 2.88 mmol, 4 equiv) and then sealed with a septum cap. The
vial was subjected to three vacuum and Ar backfill cycles, after which
anhydrous THF (20 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was heated in
a Biotage Initiator+ microwave reactor for 1 h at 135 °C. Workup and purification: The reaction mixture was cooled
to room temperature. The solids were collected by vacuum filtration
and subsequently rinsed copiously with THF to remove monosubstituted
byproducts, which are orange in color. The resultant yellow solids
were found to be 2·2Br (521 mg, 0.555
mmol, 77.1% yield). Anion exchange was achieved by adding saturated
KPF6 in MeOH/H2O (2:3, v/v) to a solution of 2·2Br (102 mg, 0.109 mmol) in MeOH (7 mL).
The precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration, rinsed with DI
water, and dried in a vacuum oven (60 °C, 230 mbar). The yellow
solids were found to be 2·2PF6 (91 mg, 0.093 mmol, 85% yield for anion exchange).
