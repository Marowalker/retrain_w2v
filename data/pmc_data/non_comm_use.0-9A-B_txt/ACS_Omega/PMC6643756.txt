(PhQ) were grafted
onto two kinds of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) samples having
different mean tube diameters by diazo-coupling reactions. The structural
details of PhQ-grafted SWCNT (PhQ/SWCNT) samples were analyzed by
X-ray diffraction and Raman measurements. It was discussed that a
few-nanometer-thick layer of polymerized PhQs covers the outside of
SWCNT bundles. The obtained PhQ/SWCNT works very well as lithium-ion
battery and sodium-ion battery electrodes, not only at room temperature
but also at 0 °C. It should be noted that the cycle performance
of the PhQ/SWCNT electrode is much better than that of PhQ encapsulated
in SWCNT (PhQ@SWCNT). We also calculated molecular base reaction energies
by density functional theory calculations to gain a qualitative insight
into the observed discharge potentials of the PhQ/SWCNT electrode.

1 Introduction
Owing
to their high energy density, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have
become indispensable for energy storage in portable electronic devices
such as cell phones and lap-top computers. However, to apply LIBs
to larger applications such as electric vehicles, we have to improve
LIBs to have higher safety, higher energy density, and lower cost.1−3 In current commercial LIBs, Li ions are stored using intercalation
reactions in electrodes, including several kinds of precious rare
metals such as Co and Ni.4 The intercalation
reactions limit the rechargeable capacity of LIBs. The usage of rare
metals increases the cost of LIBs. Therefore, eliminating the need
for intercalation reactions, and using electrodes not made from rare-metals,
are good development guidelines for next-generation LIBs.1,5,6

Some organic molecules consisting
of only abundant elements can
adsorb/desorb Li ions reversibly.5−10 As most of them have light molecular weight compared to the present
inorganic cathode materials such as LiCoO2, they have high
Li-ion storage capacity per unit weight. In addition to the high theoretical
capacities, organic materials offer better electrode properties than
inorganic materials. Organic materials are potentially low-cost because
usually they consist of no expensive elements. They are also recyclable.
Therefore, these organic molecules are fascinating materials as cathode
electrodes. Among all organic electrode materials, radical compounds
and conducting polymers have long been investigated. On the other
hand, nonradical and nonpolymeric organic molecules, recently, have
been adapted not only to LIBs, but also to sodium-, magnesium-, zinc-ion
batteries, and air batteries. However, it is not very easy to use
the nonradical and nonpolymeric organic materials as electrode materials
because most of them are easily dissoluble in organic electrolytes.
Liang et al.5 and Zhao et al.11 wrote review articles on organic electrodes
for Li- and Na-ion batteries (SIBs), respectively. As written in the
articles, although carbonyl compounds, layered compounds having large
planar structures, imide compounds, and so on have been intensively
investigated, it is still difficult to replace the current inorganic
electrodes by them. In such a situation, Liang proposed a new approach
using quinone molecule electrodes in aqueous electrolyte batteries
in 2017.12 Quinone molecules can work as
electrode materials through a radical generation/recombination process.
However, simple quinone compounds usually show capacity fading due
to their dissolution in organic electrolytes. In this paper, we describe
the electrode properties of composites of quinone molecules and carbon
nanotubes in organic electrolytes.8,10,13,14

9,10-Phenanthrenequinone
(PhQ) consisting of only C, O, and H can
store two Li ions per one molecule. The theoretical Li-ion storage
capacity of PhQ can be calculated to be 258 mAh/g. Therefore, PhQ
would be a good candidate as a high-capacity and low-cost electrode
material. However, the storage capacity of PhQ bulk sample greatly
decreases with charge–discharge cycles because of the dissolution
of PhQ molecules in organic electrolytes. We have shown in a previous
paper that the encapsulation treatment of PhQ molecules in single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was a good method to prevent the dissolution
and improve the cycle performance of PhQ electrodes.15,16 SWCNTs have good electrical conductivity and work as a conductive
additive for electrode materials. As the surface potential energy
of the inner tube surface is integrated in the center of the tube
from all diameter directions, a deep potential minimum is created
in the tube center, if the tube diameter is small.17 That is the reason why the molecules encapsulated in SWCNTs
are stabilized. We used this stabilization effect to reduce the dissolution
of PhQ molecules and could achieve an improvement of the cycle performance.
However, unfortunately, we could not stop the capacity fading completely.

In this work, we tried to graft PhQ molecules onto SWCNTs to obtain
higher stability. As SWCNTs having a huge π-conjugation system
should be chemically very stable, it is not very easy to do chemical
modification for SWCNTs. So, we performed a two-step process that
involved the diazotization18 of PhQ molecules,
followed by the reaction of PhQs with SWCNTs (see Scheme 1a). In the case of the encapsulation
system (Scheme 1b),
electrolyte ions should approach the encapsulated quinone molecules
through open tube edges. On the other hand, the grafted quinone molecules
(Scheme 1a) seem to
be more easily accessible to the ions. We investigated the Li-ion
and also the Na-ion storage properties of the synthesized sample of
PhQ grafted on SWCNTs (PhQ/SWCNT). If PhQ/SWCNT can store Na ion effectively,
it can be used as a Na-ion battery (SIB) electrode material. As Na
resource is abundant, SIB is expected to be a low-cost secondary battery.19−24 We also investigated the low-temperature performance of the PhQ/SWCNT
electrode for Li and Na ions. Furthermore, we performed density functional
theory (DFT) calculations to understand the detailed features of charge–discharge
profiles of the PhQ/SWCNT electrode. On the basis of the calculation,
we discussed the discharge potential difference for Li and Na ions.

2 Results and Discussion
In this work, we used two kinds of SWCNT samples having mean tube
diameters of 2.5 and 1.0 nm produced by e-Dips and HiPco methods,
respectively. Hereinafter, and for the sake of convenience, the two
samples will be denoted using their mean tube diameter values as SWCNT-2.5
and -1.0, respectively. Although we performed AQ and PhQ grafting
treatments for the two samples, in this paper, we discuss mainly the
electrode properties of the PhQ-grafted SWCNT-2.5 sample (PhQ/SWCNT-2.5)
in comparison with other combinations.

As previously reported,
since SWCNT-2.5 has less defective, narrow
diameter distribution and well-bundled form, its physical characterization
reveals a weak Raman D-band peak (Figure S1) and very clear X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks (Figure S2).25 We can determine
the mean tube diameter by performing XRD pattern simulation.26 The determined value 2.5 nm is in quite good
agreement with the values estimated by the peak position of radial
breathing modes,27,28 observed in the low-wavenumber
region of the Raman spectrum. The high purity was also confirmed by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation (Figure S3). We analyzed the bundle diameter size using the
TEM picture and estimated a mean bundle diameter of about 35 nm (Figure S4).

It was observed that the intensity
of the D-band peak of SWCNT-2.5
increases by the PhQ grafting treatment. This increase indicates the
formation of sp3 carbon on the surface of SWCNTs by the
reaction with diazo-PhQ molecules. On the other hand, we could not
observe any significant changes in the XRD pattern of the quasi-two-dimensional
hexagonal lattice of SWCNT-2.5 bundles after the grafting treatment,
which means that the bundle form is maintained after the PhQ grafting
treatment. Judging from these observations, we conclude that PhQ molecules
were grafted on the outer SWCNTs of the bundle surface, and that the
inner SWCNTs were kept as they were. We also performed TEM observation
of the PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 sample. However, we could not see the PhQ-grafted
phase in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) pictures of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5
(Figure S5).

The amount of PhQ grafted
on SWCNTs was evaluated by two approaches:
thermogravimetric (TG) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
The sublimation temperature of the PhQ molecule is about 200 °C,
and a drastic weight loss from 200 °C was clearly observed in
the TG curve in the case of PhQ crystals (Figure 1). On the other hand, the oxidation temperature
of the untreated SWCNT-2.5 is about 590 °C, as shown in Figure 1. The rather high
oxidation temperature also confirms the high crystallinity of SWCNT-2.5.
As the temperature difference of the two TG threshold temperatures
of PhQ and SWCNT is very large (∼400 °C), the amount of
PhQ in the PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 sample should be evaluated by TG measurement.
In fact, a two-step TG curve was observed for PhQ/SWCNT-2.5, as expected.
However, the observed two steps are not very clear because PhQ molecules
are stabilized by the connection with SWCNTs, and the crystallinity
of SWCNTs should be lowered by the grafting. Therefore, it is very
difficult to determine the critical temperature needed to evaluate
the PhQ content in the sample. If we assume the SWCNT oxidation threshold
temperature of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 to be 590 °C, as that of the untreated
SWCNT-2.5, the PhQ content can be determined as 33 wt %. Although
this value overestimates the amount of grafted PhQ, because some of
the SWCNTs of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 should have lower oxidation temperature
due to the defects formed by PhQ grafting, we can treat this value
as the maximum PhQ content in the sample.

Figure 1 TG curves of (a) bulk
PhQ, (b) PhQ/SWCNT-2.5, and (c) SWCNT-2.5.

We also performed XPS measurements to evaluate the PhQ content
as we did for the SWCNT encapsulation sample (Figure 2). As we explained in our previous paper,16 the PhQ content can be estimated by the increase
of the O/C atomic ratio. The O 1s peak on the XPS spectrum of SWCNT-2.5
drastically changes by PhQ grafting. For PhQ/SWCNT-2.5, the O 1s peak
corresponds to oxygen atoms of PhQ, namely, oxygen atoms of C=O.
The signal coming from the C=O group was observed at around
284.8 eV in the C 1s spectra. On the other hand, slightly included
impurity oxygen atoms such as oxygen atom of the C–O–H
group were observed for the untreated SWCNT-2.5 at around 286.7 eV.
The PhQ amount of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 evaluated by the increase in O/C ratio
is 28.1%. Although this value is very close to the value determined
by TG measurement, we should note that the value determined by XPS
also overestimates the PhQ content for the following reason: as mentioned
above, PhQ molecules are grafted only on the outer SWCNTs of the bundles
having a mean diameter of 35 nm. As Al Kα X-ray was used for
the XPS measurement, we could not get any information from SWCNTs
in the inner part of the bundle. Therefore, although we could not
obtain the correct PhQ amount value by either TG or XPS measurements,
we estimate that the PhQ content should be less than 33 wt %.

Figure 2 XPS spectra
of (a) SWCNT-2.5 and (b) PhQ/SWCNT-2.5.

Now we discuss how PhQ molecules are grafted on SWCNT-2.5.
The
mean tube diameter D and lattice constant a of the quasi-two-dimensional bundle hexagonal lattice
were determined from XRD simulation, and had the values of 2.5 and
2.8 nm, respectively (Figure S2).16 The tube-to-tube distance, calculated from D and a, is 0.3 nm, and the value is very
reasonable for a SWCNT bundle. Using these values, we calculated the
bundle to contain one SWCNT per 6.79 nm2 of its cross section.
Therefore, an average bundle having a diameter of 35 nm should consist
of about 142 SWCNTs. Here, we think about a structural model of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5
such that a layer of PhQ x nm in thickness covers
the SWCNT bundle of 35 nm diameter (Figure S6). Assuming the PhQ content to be 33 wt % and the density of the
PhQ layer to be 1.4 g/cm3 as that of the PhQ crystal, the
layer thickness x is calculated to be 1.3 nm. As
this x value is much larger than the molecular size
of PhQ, the PhQ layer should not be a monolayer. The grafting method
used in this study can create bonds not only between PhQ molecules
and SWCNTs but also between PhQ molecules themselves. Namely, polymerized
PhQ molecules having an average thickness of 1.3 nm are attached to
the outer surface of the SWCNT bundle. Unfortunately, the thickness
of the PhQ polymer is too thin to be observed by HRTEM (Figure S5).

From here we discuss the electrode
properties of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5.
First, we found that PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 can adsorb/desorb Li ions reversibly,
as shown in Figure 3. Two-step plateaus are clearly visible on the charge–discharge
profiles at around 2.4 and 2.8 V, which are characteristic features
of the PhQ electrode, indicating that the PhQ molecules grafted on
SWCNTs can work as Li-ion battery electrode materials. Here, we note
that the lithium storage capacity of SWCNTs in this voltage region
is negligible because lithium insertion/extraction to/from carbon
materials generally occurs in a lower potential region less than 1.0
V vs Li/Li+ (see Figure S7).
In Figure 3, the charge–discharge
capacity values per total amount of electrode and also per unit PhQ
weight are shown. The capacity value per PhQ weight is calculated
assuming 33 wt % PhQ content. Although the reversible capacity of
150 mAh/g, shown in Figure 3, was smaller than the theoretical capacity of PhQ molecules
(258 mAh/g), it should be noted that the 33 wt % used for the Figure 3 is probably overestimated.
Taking that into account, we can assume that most of the PhQ molecules,
even in their polymerized form, could adsorb Li ions, and that electron
transfer through the polymer to the SWCNT should be possible as well.

Figure 3 Room-temperature
(RT) galvanostatic charge–discharge curves
of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 used for LIBs. The measurement was performed at a
constant current density of 100 mA/g, where “g” means
the total weight of the composite electrode (PhQ/SWCNT-2.5).

As shown in Figure 4, the charge–discharge curves of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5
observed for
Na ions are almost similar to those observed for Li ions. Using the
redox potentials of Li/Li+ (−3.05 V) and Na/Na+ (−2.73 V), we can compare the plateau potential of
the discharge curves of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 for Li and Na ions. It was found
by this analysis that the discharge potential for a Na ion is about
700 mV lower than that for a Li ion, although the discharge profiles
for Li and Na ions are quite similar. The discharge potential difference
will be discussed later.

curves of
PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 used for SIBs. The measurement was performed at a constant
current density of 100 mA/g, where “g” means the total
weight of the composite electrode (PhQ/SWCNT-2.5).

Figure 5 shows the
100 cycle charge–discharge data of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 for Li-ion
batteries. In the case of the bulk PhQ sample with carbon black conductive
additive, severe capacity fading was observed in a few cycles because
of the dissolution of PhQ molecules into the electrolyte. The dissolution
of PhQ molecules was suppressed by the encapsulation treatment, as
reported in our previous paper15,16 (see Figure 5b). The capacity loss of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5
is much smaller than that of PhQ@SWCNT-2.5 because PhQs are covalently
connected to SWCNTs. As shown in Figure S8, dissolution of PhQ did not appear even after the 100 charge–discharge
cycling. In the previous paper, we reported that encapsulation of
PhQ molecules in SWCNTs also suppresses the capacity fading greatly.
However, and as shown in Figure 5, it was found that the PhQ grafting is much more effective
for the improvement of cycle performance than the encapsulation treatment.
Clear plateaus originating from the electrochemical behavior of grafted
PhQ molecules were maintained even after 50 cycles, as shown in Figure S9. On the other hand, the rate performance
of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5, shown in Figure S10,
is not very good, although it is reported that the redox reactions
of quinone molecules including PhQ are very fast.7,12,18,29 The internal
resistance of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 probably increases due to the long-wound
electron path through polymerized PhQs. As shown in Figure 5a, a small capacity drop was
observed between 50 and 60 cycles. The reason why the capacity dropped
is not clarified. However, PhQ/SWCNT showed higher capacity than PhQ@SWCNT
after the capacity drop.

Figure 5 Cycle performance of (a) PhQ/SWCNT-1.0, (b)
PhQ@SWCNT-2.5, and
(c) a simple mixture of PhQ and carbon black electrode used for LIBs.

Interestingly, the low-temperature
performance of the PhQ/SWCNT
electrodes is very good. The present commercial LIB using intercalation
reactions shows a reduction in its cell performance at low temperature.
The redox reactions of quinone molecules would not be affected very
much by decreasing temperature. Figure 6A,B show Li- and Na-ion charge–discharge curves
of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 at 0 °C. As shown in Figure 6A,B, although the reversible capacities of
PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 for both Li and Na ions are about 60% of the values
observed at room temperature (RT), almost the same charge–discharge
profiles are maintained at low temperature, except for slight increases
in the charge–discharge hysteresis. This indicates that ion-adsorbing
sites are kept at low temperature, while the activation energy for
ion adsorption depends on temperature. This profile change at low
temperature looks quite like the change with the increase in charging
rate. Both profile changes can be explained by the increase in the
over-potential for ion adsorption due to iR drop.
Of course, the increases in the current and internal resistance lead
to the larger hysteresis with the increase in the charging rate and
the decrease in temperature, respectively. Although the increase in
the internal resistance at low temperature should be related to various
factors, the change in ion mobility would be the main reason. In the
case of the PhQ@SWCNT encapsulation electrode, ion diffusion into
the inner tube space of SWCNTs is necessary for ion adsorption to
occur. On the other hand, PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 does not require the diffusion
process because PhQs are attached to the outer surface of the SWCNT
bundle. That would be the reason for the better low-temperature performance.

Figure 6 Galvanostatic
charge–discharge curves of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 used
for (A) LIBs and (B) SIBs. The measurements were performed at 0 °C
and a constant current density of 100 mA/g, where “g”
means the total weight of the composite electrode (PhQ/SWCNT-2.5).

We also performed DFT calculations
to discuss the electrode properties
of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5. It is well known that the open-circuit voltage of
a battery can be predicted by DFT calculations.29−34 This approach is applicable to the present quinone electrode batteries.
We denote the quinone electrode by Qsolid. The total reaction of the quinone battery can be expressed as follows: 1  Therefore, the open-circuit voltage (electromotive
force) E can be calculated by the following equation: 2  where G(M) expresses the Gibbs free energy of M, and F denotes the Faraday constant.

However, it is very difficult to discuss Gibbs free energy of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5
because the exact structure of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 is not known. However,
it would be meaningful to calculate the free energy difference ΔG of molecular entities in reactions (3) and (4) below, instead of calculating ΔG for the undefined solid-state structures in eq 2. 3   4  In this case, however, it is very hard to
perform a quantitative comparison between the calculated values and
experimentally observed data. Furthermore, it should be noted that eq 2 can predict the open-circuit
voltage, whereas kinetic parameters should be considered when discussing
discharge potentials. In this paper, we calculated molecular base
reaction energies, such as (3) and (4), for several combinations of electrode molecules
(AQ and PhQ) and electrolyte ions (Li and Na) to gain a qualitative
insight into the observed discharge potentials. The values of Gibbs
free energy obtained by the DFT calculation are summarized in Table S1.

First, we discuss the very different
charge–discharge profiles
of AQ and PhQ, although these two molecules have the same chemical
formula. AQ and PhQ show one-step and two-step plateau discharge curves,
respectively (see Figures S11 and 3). For PhQ, the difference between the two ΔG values for reactions (3) and (4) is quite large for both Li and Na. On the other
hand, the difference for AQ is very small. Namely, AQ can adsorb the
second Li or Na ion very easily after capturing the first ion, whereas
PhQ requires a relatively higher energy to catch the second ion, probably
due to the repulsion between adsorbed alkaline ions (Figure S12).

Next, we compare the discharge potentials
of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 for
Li and Na ions. As discussed in the previous paragraph, it was found
that the discharge potential for a Na ion is about 700 mV lower than
that for a Li ion. Of course, we should consider the kinetic parameters.
However, it is well known that the Na ion has smaller solvation energy
and larger ion mobility than the Li ion. So, if the discharge potential
difference is caused by kinetic effects, the potential for the Li
ion should be lower. Therefore, we should think about another reason.
According to our calculations, the stabilization energies of the reaction
products (LiPhQ and Li2PhQ) are larger than those of NaPhQ
and Na2PhQ, probably because Li should have stronger covalent
bonds with PhQ than Na. The stabilization energy difference would
lead to the observed discharge potential difference.

Finally,
we discuss the discharge profiles of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5. The
discharge profiles of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 show two-step plateaus similar
to those of the PhQ bulk crystal and PhQ@SWCNT samples. However, the
plateaus of PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 are not very flat compared to those of other
PhQ samples. In the cases of PhQ bulk crystal and PhQ@SWCNT samples,
all PhQ molecules are equivalent, and the discharge potentials should
be determined by reactions (3) or (4). However, PhQ molecules in PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 form a variety
of polymers and are therefore not equivalent. Each molecule should
have a slightly different redox potential from the values determined
by (3) or (4). Therefore,
PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 should have a nonflat plateau in the discharge profile.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we prepared AQ and PhQ derivatives
having amino
groups and grafted quinone molecules onto SWCNTs by diazo-coupling
reactions. The coupling reactions introduced bonds not only between
quinone molecules and SWCNT but also between the quinone molecules
themselves. Consequently, polymerized quinone molecules were connected
to SWCNTs. The structural details of the PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 sample were
analyzed by XRD and Raman measurements. It was discussed that a few-nanometer-thick
layer of polymerized PhQs covered the outside of SWCNT bundles. The
obtained PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 works very well as LIB and SIB electrodes not
only at RT but also at 0 °C. It should be noted that the cycle
performance of the PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 electrode is much better than that
of the PhQ@SWCNT encapsulation electrode. We also calculated the molecular
base reaction energies by DFT calculations to offer a qualitative
insight into the factors influencing the observed discharge potentials
of the PhQ/SWCNT-2.5 electrode.

4 Experimental
Methods
We purchased all chemicals used in this study: 9,10-anthraquinone
(AQ) (Wako pure chemical industries) and 9,10-PhQ (Sigma-Aldrich).
Two kinds of SWCNT samples produced by HiPco35 and e-Dips36 methods were also purchased
(HiPco: NanoIntegris Inc., e-Dips: Meijo Nanocarbon). For SWCNT samples,
we performed purification treatment using acid and annealing treatment
to obtain higher crystallinity. The detailed purification procedure
is described in our previous papers.15,16,25,37−39 Then, we grafted quinone molecules onto SWCNTs typically as follows.
First, a PhQ powder sample was refluxed with nitric acid at 130 °C
for 1 h to obtain nitrated PhQ. Then the obtained nitrated PhQ was
dissolved in 2% NaOH aqueous solution, and an excess amount of sodium
hydrosulfite was added to the solution to replace the nitro groups
by amino groups. Subsequently, PhQs were grafted onto SWCNTs by diazo-coupling
reactions as shown in Scheme 1. For comparison, we also prepared PhQ-encapsulated SWCNTs
(PhQ@SWCNTs) using a process described in our previous publication.16

We performed Raman measurements to check
the crystallinity, and
synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements at the Tsukuba Photon
Factory (KEK-PF) BL-18C to determine the mean tube diameter. PhQ derivatives
were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and
NMR measurements. The final products (PhQ/SWCNT composites) were thoroughly
investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM),
scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, thermogravimetric
(TG) analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements.

The paper-form PhQ/SWCNT sample obtained by vacuum filtration was
used for Li- and Na-ion charge–discharge experiments. Li and
Na metal foils were used as counter electrodes. 1 mol/L LiClO4 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl
carbonate (DEC) solution (EC/DEC = 1:1 in volume ratio) and NaClO4 dissolved in a mixture of EC and DEC solution (EC/DEC = 1:1
in volume ratio) were used as electrolytes for Li- and Na-ion charge–discharge
experiments, respectively. The charge–discharge measurements
using a conventional two-electrode-type cell (Hohsen, HS-Cell) were
conducted using a galvanostat (Toyo System, TOSCAT-3200). The cell
was assembled in an Ar-filled glove box to avoid air exposure and
contamination. Charge–discharge experiments were done inside
a thermostatic chamber (Espec, SU-241) to control the temperature
of the test cell.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were performed using
Gaussian 09 software.40 Here, we used the
B3PYP exchange–correlation hybrid functional41 with Dunning’s double-zeta correlation consistent
basis sets42 (cc-pVDZ).
