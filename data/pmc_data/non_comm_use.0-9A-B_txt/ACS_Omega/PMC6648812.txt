Probing the intermolecular interactions
and local environments
of self-assembled peptide nanostructures (SPNs) is crucial for a better
understanding of the underlying molecular details of self-assembling
phenomena. In particular, investigation of the hydration state is
important to understand the nanoscale structural and functional characteristics
of SPNs. In this report, we examined the local hydration environments
of SPNs in detail to understand the driving force of the discrete
geometric structural self-assembling phenomena for peptide nanostructures.
Advanced electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to
probe the hydrogen bond formation and geometry as well as the hydrophobicity
of the local environments at various spin-labeled sites in SPNs. The
experimental results supplement the sparse experimental data regarding
local structures of SPNs, such as the hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobicity
of the local environment, providing important information on the formation
of SPNs, which have immense potential for bioactive materials.

Introduction
The hydration state
of proteins critically influences protein structure
and function.1−3 In the initial phase of protein folding, water forms
a cage-like arrangement around the hydrophobic core of the protein,
followed by the expulsion of water during hydrophobic collapse.4−7 Folded globular proteins are characterized by the formation of a
hydration shell on the protein exterior and water-deficient interior.
Water molecules on the protein exterior show rapid residence times
in the subnanosecond range, whereas interior water molecules have
slow dynamics, with residence times of approximately 10–2 to 10–8 s.8 As noted
above, the hydration state of proteins is relatively well characterized;
however, there is a dearth of such information for self-assembled
peptide nanostructures (SPNs).

SPNs have attracted many researchers
because of their biocompatibility,
bioactive properties, and simplicity of modifying. SPNs can be applied
to many applications including tissue engineering, delivery systems,
matrices for cell culture, regenerative medicine, and biosensors.9−14

Because SPNs are formed through the bottom-up assembly of
peptides,
they share structural and functional characteristics with proteins.
However, there are also marked differences between them; proteins
are formed by the folding of a single, large polypeptide chain, whereas
SPNs form through the folding and assembly of multiple short-peptide
molecules. Thus, understanding the local dynamics, local structure,
and local hydration environment of SPNs is crucial for a better understanding
of their structural, functional characteristics, and self-assembly
mechanism as well as for the property improvement of bioactive materials
based on SPNs. For example, Stupp group examined local dynamics of
SPN by using X-band continuous wave (CW) electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) spectroscopy and showed that hydrogen bond propensity of fiber
constituent molecule is the main factor which affects internal dynamics
of self-assembled nanofiber.15

In
this study, we utilize advanced EPR techniques to investigate
the local hydration state of SPNs. This information is especially
important because intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bond
formation and the hydrophobicity of local environments play a key
role in self-assembly phenomena. For example, favorable hydrophobic
interactions and the formation of hydrogen bonds between amino acid
residues and solvent water molecules are considered to be a requirement
for lowering the thermodynamic penalty associated with dehydrating
peptide bonds, thus making self-assembling events more spontaneous.

Results
and Discussion
We designed model self-assembling peptides
that associate via β-sheet
interactions. Recently, bionanostructures based on β-sheet-forming
peptides have gained increasing interest because of their simplicity
in design and versatility in potential applications.16−18 The block copolypeptides used in this study have two functional
domains: a self-assembling domain and a hydrophilic/bioactive domain
(Figure 1a). Briefly,
a peptide sequence in the hydrophilic/bioactive domain, derived from
human immunodeficiency virus type-1 Rev protein, is rich in arginine
residues and has cell penetration and RNA-binding functions.19 To make the peptides EPR active, we performed
site-directed spin labeling20 with a 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl
(TEMPO) maleimide (abbreviated as TEMPO-MI) at the C-terminus (peptides 1, 2, and 4) and N-terminus (peptides 3 and 5), located in the exterior and interior
of SPNs, respectively (vide infra). The chemical structures of the
peptides are shown in Figure S1. Syntheses
of the peptides were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Figure S2). It should be noted that 1 does not have a
self-assembling domain; the peptide exists in solution as a single
molecular species. By contrast, the other peptides can form β-sheet-mediated
nanoribbon SPNs in an ionic strength-dependent manner (vide infra).21,22 Increasing the concentration of salt induces the formation of β-sheet-mediated
self-assembly by strengthening hydrophobic interactions (Figure S3).23 The
peaks decreased around 215 nm indicate β-sheet formation.

W-Band CW-EPR Spectroscopy
Figure 1b exhibits the W-band
(94 GHz) CW-EPR spectrum
of peptide 3 (KF 150 mM) taken at 70 K. The W-band CW-EPR
spectrum shows that the principal values of the g tensor are clearly
resolved, and the three-line 14N hyperfine splittings are
observed. There was only one gxx feature, indicating that nitroxide is forming a single hydrogen
bond.24 In addition, via EPR simulations,
we obtained the spin Hamiltonian parameters of g-
and A-tensor principal values. As a result, we found
that EPR line shapes and spin Hamiltonian parameters changed in a
certain degree for the samples (1∼5) when ionic salt (KF) is added (Figures S4 and S5). The simulation results are summarized in Table 1.

The EPR
parameters gxx and Azz of nitroxide
spin probes are sensitive to intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen
bonding and solvent polarity. According to previous research, increased
solvent polarity and hydrogen bonding decrease gxx because of unpaired electron spin density
on the oxygen atom and increased n−π* excitation energy
while Azz is increased.25−27 This trend was observed in our results (Table 1). When ionic salt was added, peptide 2, 3, 4, and 5 showed
decrease of Azz while gxx was increased, indicating
that the hydration environment around specific sites of SPNs became
hydrophobic. However, Azz change was not observed in peptide 1. This implies
that the hydration environment does not change in peptide 1 despite the addition of salt. Also, peptide 2 seemed
to show more dramatic change of EPR line shape than peptide 3 when KF is added; however, we could find out that gxx and Azz values change more in peptide 3 than in peptide 2 (Table 1), which means peptide 3 experiences
more drastic hydration environment change. To obtain more information
on the hydration state of SPN, we embark on pulse EPR spectroscopic
methods.

Q-Band Mims Electron Nuclear Double Resonance (ENDOR) Spectroscopy
To further investigate the hydrogen-bonding geometry, we performed
Q-band (34 GHz) pulse Mims ENDOR spectroscopy on samples prepared
in D2O. ENDOR is an advanced magnetic resonance technique
for determining accurate hyperfine tensors of paramagnetic species.
This method elucidates the hyperfine interaction of an unpaired electron
with surrounding nuclei.28−30 In particular, Mims ENDOR is
useful when hyperfine interaction is relatively weak.

We examined
the local structures of the self-assembled peptides by observing the
bonding geometry between the nitroxide moiety of the spin probe and
the hydrogen bond donors, possibly D2O in the system studied
here. Although the hydrogen atom of the amide bond in the peptide
can be exchanged with deuterium,31 its
effect is presumed to be low because the distance between radical
and amide bond is longer than that between the radical and the surrounding
D2O. Figure 2a displays 2H ENDOR spectra throughout the EPR envelope
of peptide 3 with KF 150 mM. Two different classes of 2H signals are observed: one with the hyperfine coupling of
∼2 MHz, and the other with the peak centered at the Larmor
frequency of 2H. The former signal comes from the deuterium
connected to the nitroxide radical by hydrogen bonding (comparatively
strong interaction), and the latter signal originates from the matrix
(weak interaction). Mims ENDOR spectra of sample 1∼5 are displayed in Figures S6 and S7.

Figure 2 (a) 2D field-dependent 2H Mims ENDOR (black) and simulations

−1.7, −0.5] MHz, Euler angle = [0, 45, 0]°. Definition
of Euler angles follows zyz convention. (b) Suggested
hydrogen-bonding geometry between D2O and the TEMPO-MI
group. Blue arrow: g tensor of TEMPO-MI; red arrow: A tensor; black,
blue, red, and green sphere indicates carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and
deuterium atom, respectively.

The 2H ENDOR simulations were performed to obtain
the
spin Hamiltonian parameters. Simulation results are summarized in Table S1. The quadrupolar coupling constant was
too small to be observed in the spectra (Figure S8).32 The rhombic hyperfine tensor
is required to simulate the spectra. Nevertheless, the hyperfine tensor
can be written with two terms: Aiso + Adip. Isotropic hyperfine splitting, Aiso (= 1/3(Axx + Ayy + Azz)), is calculated as 0 in
all samples. From the dipolar term of Adip, we can calculate the distance between the electron spin of the
nitroxide radical and the nuclear spin of deuterium using the following
equation: Tdip = gegNββN/hr3 (ge: free electron g value; gN: nuclear g value; β: Bohr magneton; βN: nuclear
magneton; and h: Planck’s constant). The obtained
distance is 2.226 Å, which is reasonable because the hydrogen
bonding length is known to range from 1.8 to 4 Å.33 Desiraju et al. categorized hydrogen bonding
into three classes: weak bonding (2–3 Å), moderate bonding
(1.5–2.2 Å), and strong bonding (1.2–1.5 Å).
Based on this conception, the measured distance between a deuterium
and the nitroxide probe indicates that it has rather weaker hydrogen
bonding. Using the obtained spin Hamiltonian parameters, we can draw
the hydrogen bonding geometry between the nitroxide radical and the
hydrogen-bonded deuterium as shown in Figure 2b. It is shown that three atoms (D···O•–N) lie on the same plane. Here, we used the
following assumption: the g tensor of TEMPO-MI is
same with that of other TEMPO derivative compounds; the gzz axis is parallel to the pz orbital of nitroxide radical and the gxx axis is parallel to the N–O• direction.24,34−36 Interestingly, 2H ENDOR spectra of 1, 2, and 3 are similar and are not affected by
the concentration of salt (Figure S6).
This phenomenon may imply that the hydrogen bonding networks are unchanged
by the degree of self-assembly events and are very well conserved
at the initial stage of self-assembly.

To further confirm the
bonding geometry in the context of similar
but different self-assembled nanostructures, we designed 4 and 5. Because 4 and 5 are
composed of a phenylalanine hydrophobic core and the volume fractions
of dissimilar blocks are different, the peptides form SPNs with unique
nanoscale geometries and configurations. Similar to 1, 2, and 3, the peptides showed similar 2H ENDOR spectra independent of ionic strength (Figure S7). Thus, the bonding geometry between
the spin probe nitroxide radical and deuterium is similar at the exterior
and interior of SPNs, and this phenomenon may be regarded as the general
behavior of β-sheet SPNs.

Q-Band ESEEM Spectroscopy
To further examine the hydration
status of the local environment of SPNs, we conducted electron spin
echo envelop modulation (ESEEM) experiments. The modulation depth
of the time domain of the ESEEM signal is known to depend not only
on the distance between the radical and nucleus but also on the number
of nuclei coupled to an electron.32,37,38 However, ENDOR results showed that the distance between
the electron spin of nitroxide radical and the nuclear spin of deuterium
is the same for all peptide samples. Thus, the observed modulation
depth in ESEEM spectra should represent the amount of D2O adjoining the nitroxide radical, and we can investigate the hydration
environment near the nitroxide radical.39,40

Figure 3a shows the Q-band
(34 GHz) ESEEM time domain (inset) and the frequency domain of peptide 3 (KF 150 mM) at g = 2.0000. The modulations
in the ESEEM time domain spectrum solely arise from deuterium, as
seen in the ESEEM frequency domain spectrum, with only one peak at
the Larmor frequency of deuterium (νn ≈ 7.9
MHz) in the measurement field. This peak is known to originate from
the matrix molecules and not from hydrogen bonded to the spin label.32

Error bar indicates standard error.

Figure 3b
displays
the relative intensities of Fourier Transformed ESEEM (FT-ESEEM) signals
with five different peptides—1, 2, 3, 4, and 5—at different
ionic strengths. The time-domain and frequency-domain ESEEM signal
of other materials are shown in Figures S10 and S11. As calculating the actual number of water molecules around
the spin probe is not possible, we investigated water accessibility
by comparing the intensity of FT-ESEEM peaks.

At low ionic strength
(0 mM KF), the ESEEM spectra of 1 showed higher peak
intensity than 2 and 3. This finding indicates
that a small number of block copolypeptides
(2 and 3) can proceed to the self-assembled
state in the absence of salt, unlike 1. In addition, 2 showed a peak intensity similar to 1 because
SPNs in pure water consisted only of a small number of peptides, which
implies that the TEMPO-MI attached to the SPN exterior experienced
a similar hydration environment as single-molecular species.

At high ionic strength (150 mM KF), the FT ESEEM peak intensity
of 1 is similar to that at low ionic strength. It implies
that self-assembly does not proceed in 1 despite salt
addition because 1 has no potential β-strand that
contributes to peptide self-assembly. The β-sheet is essential
for self-assembly because hydrophobic interactions between β-sheets
are the driving force of peptide self-assembly. Salt makes β-sheets
more hydrophobic via charge screening.23 On the contrary, the peak intensity of 2 and 3 decreased. This observation indicates that more self-assembly
occurred with an external stimulus (ionic salt), and the local environment
becomes more hydrophobic as self-assembly proceeds. Meanwhile, 3 shows a larger decrease in peak intensity than 2. This effect becomes more pronounced in the interior than in the
exterior of the SPNs, which may be because the SPN interior has a
more packed environment than the exterior, which causes the interior
to undergo a more drastic change in the hydration environment due
to the self-assembly process. We further corroborated the differential
local hydration state of the SPN interior and exterior using 4 and 5. In this case, 4 and 5 showed an FT-ESEEM behavior similar to that of 2 and 3. The peak intensity of 4 and 5 decreased when salt was added. An especially large decrease
was observed in 5. This result implies that peptide self-assembly
proceeds in 4 and 5 when salt is added and
that the interior of SPN experiences a more drastic environment change
than the exterior. SPN was also observed by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) (Figure S12). Fibrils
were clearly observed by negative-stain TEM.

Suggestion of the SPN Structure
and Its Local Hydration States
Figure 4 presents
a schematic representation of the proposed SPN structure and its local
hydration based on our advanced EPR results. For 1 with
no β-sheet domain, self-assembly phenomena do not occur regardless
of the presence of salt, which shows the same water accessibility
around TEMPO-MI molecules in 1 at different KF concentrations.
By contrast, 2 and 3 show that a low degree
of molecular assembly occurs between β-strands, even with no
ionic strength. Furthermore, additional salt promotes higher order
peptide self-assembly by increasing the hydrophobic force between
β-strands, which subsequently reduces water accessibility around
the TEMPO-MI molecule. From the ESEEM result of sample 2 or 4, it was shown that the bioactive part exists in
the water intermediate phase, which indicates that the bioactive part
forms the exterior part of the SPN structure. From the ESEEM result
of sample 3 or 5, it was shown that β-strand
parts exist in the water-poor phase, which implies β-strand
parts form the interior part of the SPN structure. Interestingly,
our suggestion on the SPN structure coincides with our previous results,22 in which we reported that the exterior of SPNs
undergoes faster motional dynamics than the interior, and the SPN
exterior has similar motional properties as a single-molecule species.
We think that these responses occur because β-strands line up
in antiparallel fashion when self-assembly occurs, making the local
interior environment more spatially limited than the exterior, as
shown in Figure 4.
Furthermore, even though the SPN exterior consists of hydrophilic
peptides, it is less hydrated than a single-molecular species possibly
due to molecular crowding.

Figure 4 Suggested SPN structure and its local hydration
states.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, W-band CW-EPR, Q-band Mims ENDOR and Q-band ESEEM
spectroscopy were utilized to understand the hydration state of SPN
structure. Three different types of peptide were chosen, and total
10 samples were prepared depending on the ionic strength (KF 0 and
150 mM) and the sites on which TEMPO-MI is located (C (1, 2, 4) and N (3, 5) terminus). W-band CW-EPR showed that EPR line shape and Hamiltonian
parameters of all the samples changed when self-assembly happens,
which indicates that the surrounding environment of peptides changes
when they are self-assembled. From Q-band Mims ENDOR spectroscopy,
it was shown that the hydrogen bonding geometry between the deuterium
and spin probe molecule at a specific peptide site is not significantly
affected when self-assembly proceeds. Most importantly, the water
accessibility of the SPN local environment was investigated using
Q-band ESEEM. Our ESEEM results revealed that the interior of SPN
has a more hydrophobic environment than the exterior (corona). Typically,
circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy has been used to probe the formation
of β-sheets and the self-assembled state. Because of the insensitivity
of CD techniques and the formation of broad signals in CD spectra,
it is difficult to verify whether similar β-sheet block copolypeptides
can form molecular assemblies at low ionic strength.21,22 Based on our advanced EPR studies, we verified that the β-sheet
block copolypeptides can self-assemble even in the absence of salt,
but only small number of peptides participate. Additional self-assembly
of block copolypeptides proceeds when ionic strength increases, resulting
in the formation of much larger self-assembled peptide structures.
All the experimental pieces of evidence clearly support that dipolar
hydrogen bonding formation is crucial for the formation of β-sheet-mediated
SPNs. Finally, we could suggest the structure of SPN based on advanced
EPR analysis results, which matches well with our previous data.22 From EPR study, we could provide experimental
evidence for elucidating the driving force of peptide self-assembly
and the detailed SPN structure. This study further broadens our perspective
on the biophysical characteristics of SPNs.

Self-Assembling Peptide
Synthesis and Spin Labeling
Peptides were synthesized on
a Rink Amide MBHA resin LL (Novabiochem)
using standard Fmoc protocols on a Tribute peptide synthesizer (Protein
Technologies). Standard amino acid-protecting groups were employed
for the synthesis. To prevent the reduction of the spin label during
cleavage, a TEMPO conjugation reaction was performed after reagent
K (TFA/1,2-ethanedithiol/thioanisole; 95:2.5:2.5) treatment of the
resin-bound peptide and purification using HPLC. The peptides were
purified by reverse-phase HPLC (water–acetonitrile with 0.1%
TFA). For spin labeling, 4-maleimido-TEMPO (TEMPO-MI; 25 μmol)
and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (50
μmol) were added to the peptide (25 μmol) and reacted
overnight. After TEMPO-MI conjugation, peptides were purified again
by reverse-phase HPLC (water–acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA). The
peptide concentration was spectrophotometrically determined using
a molar extinction coefficient of tryptophan (5500 M–1 cm–1) and TEMPO (164.1 M–1 cm–1) at 280 nm. Peptide concentration of sample 1, 2, and 3 is 250 μM while
that of sample 4 and 5 is 100 μM.

EPR Sample Preparation
20% v/v of d8-glycerol was added
to the peptide solutions for EPR measurements as a cryoprotectant.
The samples were loaded in calibrated quartz EPR tubes for Q-band
(i.d. 1.1 mm, Wilmad) and W-band (i.d. 0.5 mm, Wilmad) and frozen
in liquid nitrogen.

EPR Spectroscopy
34 GHz Q-band pulsed
EPR data were
obtained on a Bruker Elexsys E580 spectrometer using an EN5107D2 resonator.
Cryogenic temperatures were achieved with an Oxford CF-935 cryostat
and an Oxford ITC temperature controller. Electron spin echo detected
field sweep experiments were carried out using a two-pulse sequence,
π/2−τ–π–echo sequence, with
pulse length tπ/2 = 32 ns, tπ = 64 ns, and interpulse time τ
= 200 ns. Mims ENDOR was carried out using the pulse sequence, π/2−τ–π/2–T–π/2–echo, with microwave pulse lengths
of 32 ns and an interpulse time of τ = 200 ns. In this sequence,
RF power is applied during the time T (60 μs)
to drive nuclear spin transitions. The shot repetition time (S.R.T)
was 15 ms. All pulsed ENDOR spectra were obtained using stochastic
sampling for better baseline of the spectra. ESEEM experiments were
performed utilizing the three pulse sequence, π/2−τ–π/2–T–π/2–echo, with a pulse length of tπ/2 = 32 ns and Tinitial = 80 ns. Interpulse time was determined to have a similar
value with an antiblind spot (τ = 218 ns). The S.R.T was 5 ms
and shot per point (S.P.P) was 5. The obtained time domain ESEEM signal
was Fourier transformed after baseline correction and normalization.

W-band EPR data were obtained on a Bruker ELEXSYS E680 spectrometer
operating at ∼94 GHz with a cylindrical high Q-resonator (EN680).
Electron spin echo detected field sweep experiments were performed
using the two-pulse sequence, π/2−τ–π–echo,
with pulse lengths of tπ/2 = 20
ns and tπ = 40 ns and an interpulse
time of τ = 200 ns. Magnetic field of W-band data was calibrated
using the equation obtained by the below process. First, field sweep
EPR of manganese chloride (MnCl2) was measured. MnCl2 was selected because of its wide EPR signal range. Second,
proton Mims ENDOR experiment was conducted at six magnetic field positions
where manganese central transition appears. Third, the Larmor frequency
of proton is read from the ENDOR data obtained at the second step.
Fourth, because it is known that the Larmor frequency of proton is
14.90218 MHz at 3500 G, the real magnetic field could be calculated
from the Larmor frequency we obtained at the third step. Finally,
by comparing real magnetic field and displayed magnetic field, it
was shown that the real magnetic field (y) and displayed
magnetic field (x) are related by the equation, y = x + 37.58 (G). Q-band and W-band EPR
measurements were conducted at 30 and 70 K, respectively. All the
simulations (ENDOR, CW-EPR) were performed using the simulation code
provided by Easyspin.41

to wick off the excess liquid, followed by adding 2 μL of 1%
