We
investigate the physicochemical interactions of gold nanorod (GNR) with single-stranded, double-stranded,
and hairpin DNA structures to improve the biological compatibility
as well as the therapeutic potential, including the photothermal effect
of the conjugates. Studies have demonstrated that different DNA secondary
structures, containing thiol group, have different patterns of physicochemical
interaction. Conjugation efficiency of paired oligonucleotides are
significantly higher than that of oligonucleotides with naked bases.
Furthermore, hairpin-shaped DNA structures are most efficient in terms
of conjugation and increased dispersion, with least interference on
GNR near-infrared absorbance and photothermal effect. Our conjugation
method can successfully exchange the overall coating of the GNR, attaching
the maximum number of DNA molecules, thus far reported. Chemical mapping
depicted uniform attachment of thiolated DNA molecules without any
topological preference on the GNR surface. Hairpin DNA-coated GNR
are suitable for intracellular uptake and remain dispersed in the
cellular environment. Finally, we conjugated GNR with 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine-containing
DNA hairpin and the conjugate demonstrated significant cytotoxic activity
against human cervical cancer cell line (KB). Thus, hairpin DNA structures
could be utilized for optimal dispersion and photothermal effect of
GNR, along with the delivery of cytotoxic nucleotides, developing
the concept of multimodality approach.

Introduction
Gold nanostructures
are versatile and programmable nanomaterials
that may be combined with diverse DNA structures for various applications.1−4 Gold nanorods (GNRs) have received notable attention due to their
unique optical and electronic properties that could be utilized for
biomolecule sensing as well as hyperthermia-based therapy.5−7 Cell death can be induced above 45 °C;8,9 thus,
photothermal approaches in combination with chemotherapeutic molecules
may be useful for cancer treatment. Moreover, these nanoparticles
have the potential for molecular targeting in addition to their natural
targeting property via enhanced permeability and retention effect.10,11 Nanoparticles, such as carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods, are being
investigated for hyperthermia-based therapies, utilizing near-infrared
(NIR) radiation that can pass through tissues to the deeply located
tumors.12,13

While carbon nanotubes demonstrate
significant toxicity that limits
biological applications,14,15 surface-modified GNR
showed its biocompatibility in vivo.16−18 GNRs are nearly always
synthesized with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) coating.16 CTAB is a positively charged surfactant that
is cytotoxic to normal human tissue.19 Furthermore,
low-energy interaction of CTAB with GNR surface is likely to cause
aggregation in vivo, due to dilution in combination with high salt
concentration and temperature.16 Thus,
it is desirable to exchange the overall coating of GNRs with biocompatible
molecules, such as oligonucleotides, which have been systematically
studied by several research groups. Previously reported methods performed
conjugation of thiolated DNA via round-trip phase transfer,20 vinyl carboxylate-modified cationic surfactant
in combination with NH2-modified DNA molecules,21,22 direct DNA functionalizing via salt aging23 or low pH,24 and ligand-exchange approach
using poly(vinylpyrrolidone) as intermediate.25 The physicochemical interactions of oligonucleotides with GNR have
neither been previously studied systematically nor have previous studies
reported the efficiency of different DNA structures for conjugation,
including their effect on the photothermal potential of GNR and dispersion
of the conjugates in biological environment.

For the first time,
we have systematically investigated physicochemical
interactions of different DNA secondary structures with GNR using
analytical spectroscopy and high-resolution microscopy, including
chemical mapping, to determine their pattern of conjugation and their
photothermal effect. The relative efficiencies of conjugation of different
DNA structures, single-stranded (ss), double-stranded (ds), and hairpin
(hp), are also investigated. Greater loading and efficient conversion
of NIR radiation into heat are important considerations to identify
the best-suited DNA structure for photothermal as well as multimodality
applications. Experimental reports demonstrated that hp-DNA has significantly
greater efficiency to be loaded on the GNR with maximum potential
for the photothermal effect. High-resolution microscopy depicted that
the hp-DNA-GNR conjugate remains monodispersed in the cellular environment
without any indication of aggregation and the conjugate is suitable
for intracellular uptake. Further, the laser-induced selective delivery
of oligonucleotides in cellular environment could be optimized in
light of the present study. GNR has been used for selective DNA/RNA
delivery without in-depth investigation of the physicochemical properties
of the conjugates.22,26 Knowledge of the present work
should significantly enhance the strategies of future studies in the
field. Utilizing our findings, we have successfully conjugated a DNA
hairpin containing cytotoxic nucleotide, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine
(FdU), with GNR. The FdU-substituted hairpin was used to estimate
the potential anticancer activity, which could be achieved with simultaneous
application of GNR-mediated photothermal effect in the presence of
FdU-induced cytotoxicity. The conjugate exhibited significant cytotoxicity
against KB cells with and without 808 nm laser irradiation. These
findings demonstrated that the hairpin structure is optimally fitted
for coating GNR with maximum amount of cytotoxic oligonucleotide and
the resultant conjugate is promising for multimodality treatment.

Results
and Discussion
Spectroscopic Characterization of GNR Conjugates
UV–vis
spectra of the conjugates (Figure 1a) showed that the NIR absorbance band of CTAB-capped
GNR is red-shifted from 807 to 826 nm with a small reduction (∼7%)
in intensity for hp-DNA coating, while ss- and ds-DNA coating caused
significant quenching (82 and 28%, respectively). ds-DNA conjugation
caused a peak broadening effect with a red shift to 853 nm, while
ss-DNA binding caused a large blue shift to 751 nm. A significant
reduction in the NIR band intensity might have resulted from aggregation
and surface plasmon dumping, in the case of ss- as well as ds-DNA
conjugation, while change in band wavelength indicates distinctive
interaction of different DNA structures with the GNR surface electrons.
A characteristic DNA band at 260 nm was observed in all cases of DNA
conjugation that is not present in CTAB-coated GNR. Net absorbance
at 260 nm is maximum for the hp-DNA-GNR conjugate, indicating the
maximum amount of DNA attachment, followed by ds- and ss-DNA-bound
GNR.

Figure 1 Biophysical characterization of GNR conjugates. (a) UV–vis
spectra of the GNR conjugates, showing longitudinal SPR band of GNR
at 807 nm for the CTAB-capped GNR, which has been shifted differently with varying intensities for
ss-, ds-, and hp-DNA conjugation. The band at 260 nm suggested DNA
conjugation, which is maximum for hp-DNA-GNR and progressively reduced
for ds-DNA-GNR as well as ss-DNA-GNR. In the case of CTAB-GNR, there
is no band at 260 nm. (b) Graphical representation of ζ potential
of GNR conjugates. Positively charged CTAB-GNR showed a value of +40.9
mV, which has been changed to −31.6, −12.9, and −3.2
mV, respectively, for negatively charged hp-, ds-, and ss-DNA conjugation.
The error bars represent standard deviation of three independent experimental
data sets. (c) Raman spectra of the GNR conjugates, showing a characteristic
band at 1390 cm–1. The band has maximum intensity
for ss-DNA-GNR and reduces steadily for ds- and hp-coated GNR. (d)
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the conjugates, showing
characteristic C=O band for DNA at 1658 cm–1. Another band at 2925 cm–1 enhanced upon hp- and
ds-DNA conjugation region is assigned to N–H and C–H
vibrations.

ζ potential changed
from +40.9 to −31.6 mV for hp-DNA
conjugation (Figure 1b), suggesting the successful exchange of GNR coating and removal
of CTAB. In the case of ss- and ds-DNA conjugation, the ζ potential
values were −3.2 and −12.9 mV, respectively. Moreover,
high-magnitude ζ potential of the hp-DNA-GNR suggested their
stability in suspension (Figure 2), while lower ζ potential values of ss- and
ds-DNA-bound GNR indicated aggregation.27,28

Figure 2 Microscopic
characterization of GNR conjugates. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of (a) CTAB-, (b) ss-DNA-, (c) ds-DNA-, and
(d) hp-DNA-coated GNR with similar magnification (scale bar = 100
nm); all samples were washed three times for CTAB removal.

Figure 1c depicts
the characteristic Raman spectra of GNR conjugates. A Soret band at
1390 cm–1 is observed in all DNA-conjugated as well
as CTAB-capped GNR samples. However, the intensity of the band is
maximum in the case of ss-DNA-coated GNR, followed by ds-DNA-bound
GNR, and minimum for hp-DNA-GNR. The band is assigned to the C=O
symmetric stretching.29−31 The results indicate that unpaired DNA bases are
interacting more closely with GNR surface, increasing symmetric stretching
of C=O.

In all cases of DNA-conjugated GNR, FTIR spectra
showed the DNA
characteristic band at 1658 cm–1 (Figures 1d and S1, Supporting Information), assigned to C=O stretching
vibration.29−31 The band is more pronounced in ds-DNA-GNR as well
as hp-DNA-GNR and significantly reduced in ss-DNA-GNR, while it is
split into four smaller peaks for only DNA sample, covering the complete
region of 1590–1720 cm–1. The formation of
a single broad and enhanced peak upon conjugation of DNA molecules
on GNR surface indicated a uniform vibrational mode of all C=O
groups. Another band at 2925 cm–1 significantly
enhanced upon conjugation of DNA molecules with GNR, especially in
the cases of ds and hp. The band at 2925 cm–1 is
assigned to N–H or C–H vibrations,29−31 which is enhanced
most likely due to uniform vibrations of the responsible groups.

Microscopic Characterization of GNR Conjugates
TEM
images of GNR conjugates (Figures 2 and S2, Supporting Information)
clearly demonstrated that ss-DNA conjugation caused notable aggregation,
while ds-DNA reduced aggregation and produced some monodispersed GNR
conjugates. hp-DNA conjugation remarkably increased GNR dispersion
with no sign of aggregation. The removal of CTAB in the absence of
suitable coating agent also caused aggregation. The agglomeration
of ss-DNA-coated GNR leads to change in suspension color from brownish
red to blackish violet (Figure S3, Supporting
Information) and hp-DNA conjugation never demonstrated significant
color change, while ds-DNA-attached GNR suspension showed little change
in color to purple red with reduction in intensity.

Chemical Mapping
of GNR Conjugates
Figures 3 and S4 (Supporting Information)
show the images of scanning transmission
electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray (STEM-EDX) chemical mapping,
to investigate the elemental content of the GNR coating materials.
All GNR conjugates were mapped for bromine (magenta). Results depicted
traces of bromine in the case of CTAB-coated GNR (top row in Figure S4, Supporting Information), while ss-,
ds- and hp-DNA-conjugated GNR samples showed no significant bromine
traces, indicating efficient removal of CTAB. GNR samples (CTAB: top;
ss: second top; ds: third top; and hp: bottom row in Figure 3) were also mapped for sulfur
and phosphorus, to confirm the presence of DNA and thiol group, including
the topological pattern of conjugation. All three DNA-conjugated GNR
samples showed the presence of sulfur (yellow) and phosphorus (green)
all over the nanorod surface, suggesting uniform binding pattern of
thiolated DNA without any topological preference.

conjugates. Images of STEM-EDX chemical
mapping. The top row depicts the traces of chemical mapping result
of CTAB-GNR sample; from left to right, the images represent the footprints
of sulfur (yellow), phosphorus (green), and their overlay with STEM
images of GNR. The second row from the top exhibits ss-DNA-GNR chemical
mapping traces; from left to right, the images represent sulfur (yellow),
phosphorus (green), and overlay of footprints with STEM images of
GNR. The third row from the top depicts ds-DNA-GNR and bottom row
depicts hp-DNA-GNR chemical mapping traces in a similar order to that
mentioned above.

Secondary Structure-Dependent
DNA Binding Efficiency
Efficiency of conjugation was calculated
to asses to what extent
DNA secondary structure contributes to the process of thiolated DNA
binding with GNR. Figure 4 shows the UV–vis spectra of total DNA added for conjugation,
along with DNA-GNR conjugates and unconjugated DNA left. Figure 4a and its summary
in Figure 4d (top row)
demonstrate that ss-DNA has lower efficiency for binding on GNR; only
28.6% of the total DNA added was conjugated. Percentage of binding
progressively increased to 43% for ds-DNA (Figure 4b,d, middle row) and to 75% for hp-DNA (Figure 4c,d, bottom row).
In terms of number, approximately 957 ss-, 1439 ds-, and 2510 hp-DNA
molecules were conjugated on each GNR (Figure S5c, Supporting Information), which are significantly higher
than those reported in previous studies.5,22,24 The lower amount of DNA attachment in case of ss
might have resulted from aggregation during conjugation (Figures 2b and S2d, Supporting Information) and/or more coverage
of GNR surface area by each DNA molecule due to horizontal layering.
While one ss-DNA molecule covered 1.15 nm2 surface area
on the GNR, ds- and hp-DNA molecules covered 0.76 and 0.44 nm2, respectively. A high amount of binding in the case of hp-DNA
might have resulted from greater GNR dispersion and vertical orientation
of hairpin molecules on the GNR surface. Intermediate binding amount
of ds-DNA might have generated from partial horizontal layering as
well as vertical orientation on the GNR surface. In the case of ss-DNA,
high-resolution TEM images clearly exhibited the presence of a sticky
matrix between nanorods, which could have been produced from ss-DNA
and CTAB interaction, causing aggregation (Figure S2d, Supporting Information; red square marked region).

efficiencies of (a)–(c). All absorbance at 260 nm was measured
with four times dilution, as mentioned; corresponding DNA concentrations
calculated with dilution factor multiplication.

Photothermal Effect of the GNR Conjugates
The heating
potential of GNR conjugates were evaluated to determine the role of
DNA secondary structures on the photothermal effect of GNR. Aqueous
suspensions of concentrations 150, 300, and 600 μg/mL of the
conjugates were irradiated by 808 nm continuous wave laser, with powers
of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 W for 30, 60, and 120 s. Representative graphs
displaying the laser power-, time-, and concentration-dependent heating
are exhibited in Figures 5 and S6–S8, Supporting Information.
Conjugation of hp-DNA demonstrated the maximum photothermal effect,
while ss- and ds-DNA binding reduced the heating efficiency of GNR.
The vast majority of comparisons had p-values less
than 0.05 with many less than 0.01. For example, while a laser power
of 1.1 W is required to increase the temperature by 3 °C of a
300 μg/mL hp-DNA-GNR suspension with an irradiation time 60
s, the same extent of temperature increase in similar conditions required
1.71 W for ds-DNA-GNR and it cannot be achieved for ss-DNA-GNR even
with 2.0 W laser power (Figures 5a and S6, Supporting Information).
Thus, hp-DNA-functionalized GNR should be able to achieve biologically
relevant heating at lower laser power, which can reduce the surrounding
tissue damage in the case of in vivo applications.8,13

Figure 5 Estimation
of the photothermal effect of the GNR conjugates. Representative
plots for in vitro heating of CTAB as well as ss-, ds-, and hp-DNA-coated
GNR suspensions. (a) Laser power-dependent photothermal effect demonstrated
a linear relation in all cases. (b) Irradiation time-dependent heating
of all conjugates also demonstrated linear relation. (c) Concentration-dependent
hyperthermia effect demonstrated nonlinear relation for all GNR samples
except ds-DNA-GNR. The error bars represent standard deviation of
three independent experimental data sets in all cases.

The linear time-dependent heating of GNR conjugates
for a given
concentration and laser power is informative to identify conditions
suitable for therapeutically relevant hyperthermia. For example, a
5 °C temperature increase can be obtained by irradiating a 300
μg/mL hp-DNA-GNR conjugate with 1.5 W laser beam for 33 s, while
the same temperature increase requires 56 and 87 s, respectively,
in the cases of ds- and ss-DNA-conjugated GNR, under identical conditions
(Figures 5b and S7, Supporting Information).8,9

Requirement of hp-DNA-coated GNR concentration is significantly
lower compared to the ss- and ds-DNA-conjugated GNR. For example,
while an hp-DNA-GNR concentration of 175 μg/mL is required for
a 7 °C temperature increase upon 1.5 W laser irradiation for
60 s, a similar temperature increase cannot be achieved for ss- as
well as ds-DNA-coated GNR even with 600 μg/mL concentration
under identical conditions (Figures 5c and S8, Supporting Information).
Therefore, hp-DNA-GNR conjugates can achieve biologically relevant
heating at lower concentrations, which are more likely to be delivered
in vivo.8,9

Stability of hp-DNA-GNR Conjugates in Biologically
Relevant
Conditions in Vitro
The above experimental results demonstrated
that hp-DNA has maximum uploading efficiency and produce dispersed
nanoconjugates, including greater photothermal effect, and therefore
suitable for future biomedical applications. The stability of the
hp-DNA-GNR conjugate was evaluated in biologically relevant conditions.
hp-DNA-functionalized GNR were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) (pH −7.4) at 37 °C for 6, 18, and 24 h. Suspensions
were then centrifuged, supernatants were collected, and pellets were
resuspended in same volume of PBS, followed by UV–vis scanning
to investigate any DNA release, including the effect on NIR absorbance.
Results are depicted in Figure 6. While CTAB-capped GNR showed a drastically reduced absorbance
band in the NIR region, hp-DNA-GNR conjugate exhibited its characteristic
NIR band at 812 nm. Incubation for 6 h in the PBS at 37 °C caused
little reduction in the NIR absorbance and 38.5% DNA release, in comparison
to the freshly suspended hp-DNA-GNR (Figure 6a,d). Incubation for 18 h in a similar condition
reduced NIR absorbance to half and caused 40% DNA release, while 24
h incubation caused no further reduction in NIR absorbance but increased
the DNA release to 51.5% (Figure 6b–d).

relevant conditions in vitro. UV–vis spectra of the hp-DNA-conjugated

summarized in (d).

Cellular Uptake of GNR
Conjugates and Cytotoxicity in Combination
with FdU-Hairpin
Although previous studies demonstrated intracellular
uptake of DNA-functionalized GNR for gene delivery, none of these
studies investigated dispersion of the conjugates in the cellular
environment by high-resolution microscopy. Dispersions of ss-, ds-,
and hp-DNA-coated GNR were studied in KB cell line under standard
tissue culture conditions. ss-DNA-GNR conjugates are found in the
aggregated state (Figure 7a,b); larger aggregates remained outside the cell adjacent
to the plasma membrane (Figure 7a), while small agglomerates were transported inside (Figure 7b). A large fraction
of the ds-DNA-GNR conjugates formed bigger aggregates and are found
outside the cell (Figure 7d), and only a small portion went inside (Figure 7c). In contrast, no aggregation
was observed in the case of hp-DNA-GNR and discrete monodispersed
GNR conjugates were found inside the cell (Figure 7e,f). Intracellular uptakes of all DNA-conjugated
GNR samples were further investigated with confocal microscopy, using
Cy5-labeled DNA versions. Figure 7g–i and S9 (Supporting
Information) demonstrate intracellular uptake of all conjugates, while
hp-DNA-GNR-treated cells showed relatively higher Cy5 fluorescence.

and cytotoxicity in combination with FdU-hairpin. (a) TEM images of
ss-DNA-GNR-treated KB cells, with larger aggregates remaining outside
the cell and (b) smaller aggregates inside the cell in a vesicular
structure. (c) Region of the intracellular space containing ds-DNA-GNR

image of cells treated with Cy5-labeled ds-DNA-GNR (red), followed

conjugate. (i) Image of cells treated with Cy5-labeled hp-DNA-GNR
(red), followed by DAPI staining (blue), demonstrating efficient intracellular
uptake of the conjugate. (j) Graphical representation of cell viability
assay results, demonstrating the cytotoxicity of FdU-hairpin-coated
GNR in a dose-dependent manner. Cytotoxicity is further enhanced with
NIR laser irradiation in the highest concentration. The error bars
in all cases represent the standard deviation of three independent
experimental data sets.

FdU-containing DNA hairpin was conjugated with GNR and investigated
on KB cells to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of the conjugates with
and without NIR radiation. The results are depicted in Figure 7j. As evident from the data,
the FdU-hairpin-coated GNR demonstrated cytotoxicity toward KB cells
in a dose-dependent manner, at concentrations ranging from 93.75 to
3000 ng/mL, which corresponds to 3–96 nM in terms of FdU-hairpin
concentration.32−34 NIR irradiation demonstrated some effect on the cytotoxic
activity of the conjugate, especially at the maximum concentration
tested. Maximum cytotoxicity is observed at the highest concentrations,
with 3000 ng/mL GNR and 96 nM FdU-hairpin; almost 62% cells were killed
in combination with NIR irradiation, while FdU-hairpin-GNR alone killed
∼47% cells.

Conclusions
In the present study,
we systematically investigated the effects
of DNA secondary structures on GNR physicochemical and biological
properties. We also standardized a method for successfully exchanging
overall GNR surface coating with maximum number of DNA molecules thus
far reported.5,22,24 This is the first time that ss-, ds-, and hp-DNA structures have
all been conjugated to GNR under identical conditions and evaluated
in terms of dispersion, conjugation efficiency, photothermal potential,
and biocompatibility. Our studies show that ds- and ss-DNA structures
are relatively less efficient for conjugation with GNR and they induce
aggregation and reduce the photothermal effect. A large fraction of
the aggregated ss-DNA-GNR as well as ds-DNA-GNR remained outside the
cell, while smaller aggregates become internalized. Intracellular
delivery of the conjugates in the aggregated condition could be useful
for experimental purposes, delivering genes and other suitable agents,
but might not be promising for future clinical applications.22,26,35,36 In contrast, hairpin DNA structures are most efficient for conjugation
with the GNR surface and produce highly dispersed nanoconjugates,
demonstrating maximum photothermal effect, and stable under biologically
relevant conditions. hp-DNA-GNR conjugates are suitable for carrying
cytotoxic nucleotides in a large amount inside the cell and they remain
dispersed in the cellular environment. Therefore, hairpin could be
a very promising structure for oligonucleotide-based therapeutics
delivery via GNR and suitable for multimodality applications.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of Gold Nanorods
Gold nanorod was synthesized
following the previously published works by Megan et al.37 and Jana., N. R.38 The growth solution was prepared at 25–30
°C. HAuCl4 (200 μL, 100 mM) was added to 40
mL of CTAB (100 mM) and mixed thoroughly by pipetting, followed by
addition of 40 μL of AgNO3 (100 mM), and the solution
was gently mixed by inverting the tube. Then, 44 μL of 37% HCl
was introduced to the solution, followed by addition of 360 μL
of ascorbic acid (100 mM), and mixed gently until the solution became
colorless. Immediately afterward, 50 μL of ice-cold NaBH4 solution (2 mM) was added to the unstirred growth solution
and allowed to react overnight.38,39 The resulting gold
nanorods had dimensions of 30.0(±5) nm × 10.0(±1) nm
and absorbance maxima at about 800–810 nm. The GNR size distribution
was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (Figure S5a, Supporting Information). A standard curve of concentration
versus absorbance at λmax (808 nm) was prepared to
determine the concentration of the GNR stock for different batches
of synthesis (Figure S5b, Supporting Information).

Conjugation of DNA-GNR
For the process of conjugation
of different DNA secondary structures on GNR surface, we used thiolated
versions of single-stranded 10-mer of thimidine (T10) as
ss-DNA and consecutive 10 A–T base pairs (A–T)10 as ds-DNA, and a hairpin DNA sequence consists of a 10-base-pairs
stem with all A–T base pairing and a CGAAG loop as hp-DNA33,41 (Figure S10, Supporting Information).
For the evaluation of anticancer activity of the nanoconjugate, we
used cytotoxic nucleotide-containing DNA hairpin, where 10 consecutive
thymine were substituted with FdU nucleobases.33,41 For confocal microscopy, Cy5-labeled DNA molecules were used. Native
gel electrophoresis, as described in the previous studies, confirmed
discrete intramolecular DNA hairpin formation.33 Conventional nucleotide-containing thiolated DNA sequences
were supplied by GCC Biotech India Pvt. Ltd., and all FdU-containing
thiolated DNA sequences were supplied by the Wake Forest University
Health Sciences. All thiolated DNA sequences were purified twice by
gel-filtration chromatography using a Sephadex G-25 column with high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade water. All of the reactions were
carried out in HPLC-grade water, as well.

For the preparation
of 1 mL of each DNA-GNR suspension, 1 mL of CTAB-coated GNR suspension
(GNR concentration, 300 μg/mL) was washed by centrifugation
at 15 000g for 30 min at 30 °C. A 95%
supernatant was discarded, and the GNR pellet was resuspended in 1
mL of HPLC water by sonication and vortexing. The washing step was
repeated again, the final GNR pellet was resuspended in 10% of the
initial volume, i.e., 100 μL of water.42 This GNR suspension was kept in 4–8 °C for 30 min before
adding DNA to it. All of the hp-, ds-, and ss-DNA stock solutions
were prepared in HPLC-grade water at a concentration of 100 μM.
Monomeric hp-DNA and ds-DNA were prepared by heating DNA solutions
at 85 °C for 5 min, followed by rapid cooling in ice. DNA molecules
were conjugated on the GNR surface by adding 12 nmol of each ice-cold
DNA solution in cold GNR suspensions, as prepared above after washing
(final DNA concentration, 12 μM). DNA addition was done in ice,
and the volume was adjusted with ice-cold water to 1 mL. The DNA-GNR
suspensions were mixed slowly and carefully by pipetting one to two
times. After DNA addition and mixing, the suspensions were transferred
to room temperature (25–30 °C) and incubated for 48 h
at static condition. For efficient DNA conjugation, the key point
is keeping GNR particles in dispersed monomeric condition while removing
CTAB to its minimum required concentration. Efficient removal of CTAB,
keeping GNRs monomeric, is possible by efficiently washing salt from
the GNR suspension and keeping the suspension at cold after second
wash, which significantly reduce CTAB dissociation from GNR surface,
while keeping very little CTAB free in the suspension. Efficient removal
of salt from DNA solution is also very important as it can cause GNR
aggregation during conjugation. In salt-free condition, most likely
CTAB dissociates slowly, providing opportunity to the thiolated DNA
molecules for conjugation. Since Au–S has a relatively stronger
interaction with its partially covalent character, it remains stable
after formation at room temperature, without providing further opportunity
to CTAB molecules for interaction with GNR. For all in vitro experiments,
a control CTAB-GNR suspension was included after removal of excess
CTAB and HPLC water was added in place of DNA. The color of the DNA-GNR
suspensions changed gradually after DNA addition. After 48 h of incubation
at room temperature, the DNA-GNR suspensions were centrifuged at 10 000g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove unconjugated DNA, the supernatants
were collected and scanned to determine the amount of unbound DNA,
and the pellets were resuspended in equal volume of water by brief
sonication for 2–3 s (Figure S3,
Supporting Information). The formation of DNA-GNR conjugates was evaluated
by UV–vis spectroscopy. The characteristic absorbance of DNA
around 260 nm and characteristic NIR band were monitored.

Spectroscopic
Characterization of DNA-GNR Conjugates
UV–vis spectra
were acquired under ambient conditions using
a TECAN infinite M 200 PRO spectrophotometer; hp-, ds-, and ss-DNA-conjugated
GNR suspensions along with CTAB-capped GNR were scanned at the rate
of 1 nm/s, over the range of 230–1000 nm using a quartz cuvette
of 1 cm path length. ζ potential values of the conjugates were
measured at ambient conditions using a Malvern Zetasizer S spectrophotometer
with a compatible cuvette. For Raman spectroscopy, 10 μL of
each DNA-conjugated GNR and CTAB-GNR samples were placed on a glass
slide and allowed to dry in static condition at room temperature.
Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRAM HR (Jobin Yvon) spectrometer
equipped with an air-cooled 785 nm laser source and a Peltier-cooled
charge-coupled device detector.43 The laser
beam from the Raman spectrometer was focused onto the sample through
a 100× microscope objective with a numerical aperture of 0.9
and scanned over the region 100–3000 cm–1. For FTIR spectra, 1200 μL of each sample was centrifuged
at 20 000g for 1 h at 4 °C and the supernatant
was removed completely. Then, the pellets were resuspended in 20 μL
of deuterium oxide (D2O); a nonthiolated hp-DNA dissolved
in D2O with a concentration 12 μM was used as a DNA-only
control along with CTAB-GNR; and all of the samples were scanned over
the range of 1000–4000 cm–1 with a PerkinElmer
Spectrum 1000 spectrophotometer, using a liquid sample holder. D2O was used to avoid any interference from H2O,
especially in the region 2700–4000 cm–1.44

Microscopic Characterization of DNA-GNR Conjugates
For TEM imaging and chemical mapping by STEM-EDX, the GNR conjugates
were diluted 10 times; 10 μL of each diluted suspension was
placed on a carbon-coated 300 mesh copper grid and incubated for 15
min at room temperature; and then air-dried under the same condition.
The samples were visualized under a JEOL JEM 2100F transmission electron
microscope using a 200 kV accelerating voltage.45 Chemical mapping was done in the STEM mode of the same
instrument under similar condition.

In Vitro Heating of DNA-GNR
Conjugates
The heat emitted
by GNR conjugates upon NIR irradiation was evaluated by measuring
the change in temperature of their aqueous suspensions with a mercury
thermometer. GNR suspensions (1 mL) were placed in sealed NIR-transparent
glass cuvettes fitted with a thermometer. The sample was then irradiated
by an 808 nm laser beam using a CNI Laser MDL-III 808 (FC) laser system
with power levels of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 W for durations of 30, 60,
or 120 s. The initial temperature of each solution was recorded prior
to irradiation, and the maximum temperature was recorded postirradiation.13 The net temperature increase was estimated by
subtracting the heating of pure water in similar conditions.

Evaluation
of Stability of hp-DNA-GNR Conjugates at Physiological
Conditions
After conjugation, 1000 μL of hp-DNA and
CTAB-coated GNR suspensions were centrifuged at 10 000g for 1 h at 4 °C and the pellets were resuspended
in 1× PBS. GNR suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 0,
6, 18, and 24 h; 250 μL of each sample of different time points
were collected and centrifuged at 10 000g for
1 h at 25 °C. The supernatants were collected and the pellets
were resuspended in the same volume of 1× PBS by brief sonication.
All GNR samples and the corresponding supernatants were scanned with
a UV–vis spectrophotometer over a range of 230–1000
nm to detect DNA released in the supernatant over time as well as
change in NIR absorbance.

Study of Intracellular Dispersion of DNA-GNR
Conjugates
All tissue culture experiments were performed
on human cervical cancer
cells (KB cell line). The cell line was gifted by Dr. Chinmay Kumar
Panda, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India. The
cells were grown in high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium, supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 1.5% pen–strep–glutamine (Gibco, reference
no. 10378-016, 100 mL) in a humid atmosphere maintained at 37 °C
with 5% CO2. The cells were seeded in 90 mm plates at a
cell density of 106 cells/plate with 6 mL of complete medium.
After 24 h, the medium was removed and the cells were washed with
2 mL of PBS, followed by addition of complete medium containing 3
μg/mL of hp-, ds-, or ss-DNA-coated GNR. After 24 h of incubation,
the medium was removed and the cells were washed with 1 mL of chilled
3% glutaraldehyde fixative solution in phosphate buffer. The fixative
solution (1 mL) was added again in each plate and kept at 4 °C
for 5 min, followed by incubation at room temperature (25–30 °C)
for 1 h.47,48 Then, the cells were scraped carefully from
the plates using a scraper and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min.
The supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in
1 mL of ice-cold fresh fixative solution. The cells were again centrifuged
at 1500 rpm for 5 min before secondary fixation and washed with PBS.
Secondary fixation was done by incubating the cells in osmium tetroxide
for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by washing with PBS. Cell dehydration,
embedding, tissue sectioning, and staining for TEM were done following
the standard protocol.49−51 Tissue sections were loaded on 300 mesh copper grid
and investigated under a JEOL JEM-100CX II transmission electron microscope
at 120 kV under variable magnifications.

Determination of Cellular
Uptake of DNA-GNR Conjugates
To investigate the cellular
uptake of the complex, Cy5-labeled versions
of the thiolated DNA samples were used for conjugation; cell nuclei
were stained with DAPI after fixation and intracellular fluorescence
of Cy5 and DAPI was investigated. The cells were grown on coverslips
at a cell density 10 000/0.5 mL complete medium for 24 h and
then treated with complete medium containing nanoconjugates of concentration
3.0 μg/mL and incubated for 18 h. At the end of incubation,
the cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde
for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by washing with PBS three times. DAPI
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, product no. 62248) staining solution of
1 μg/mL was prepared in PBS and added on the coverslips, followed
by incubation at room temperature (25–30 °C) for 1 min.
After incubation, excess DAPI stain was removed by washing with PBS
for three times.52 The coverslips were
mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, reference no. P36970). Then, the slides
were incubated at room temperature for 3 h, protected from light,
and investigated under a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8) using
the imaging software Leica Application Suite. The images were overlaid
using ImageJ 1.46 software.53

Determination
of Cytotoxicity of FdU-Hairpin-GNR Conjugates
in vitro
For the experiment, FdU-containing DNA hairpin was
used in conjugation with GNR. The cytotoxicity of the FdU-hairpin-GNR
conjugate was determined using a cell viability assay with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) readout. DNA-GNR was prepared and sterilized with filtration
through a 0.2 μm sterile filter; after filtration, the concentration
was ∼300 μg/mL. The cells were seeded in a 48-well plate
at a cell density of 5000 cells/well with 250 μL of complete
medium. After 24 h, the medium was removed and the cells were washed
twice with 500 μL of PBS, followed by addition of complete medium
containing varying concentrations of the nanoconjugate. The final
GNR concentrations of the conjugate were 93.75, 187.5, 375, 750, 1500,
and 3000 ng/mL corresponding to 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 nM FdU-hairpin
concentrations. The media of wells assigned for control and laser
only were replaced with fresh complete media and incubated overnight.
After 24 h, the cells were washed with 500 μL of PBS, followed
by addition of fresh media. Wells assigned for laser-only and DNA-GNR
+ laser treatment were irradiated with a 808 nm laser at a power density
of 0.85 W/cm2 for 60 s and incubated at 37 °C for
24 h. After incubation, 62.5 μL of 1.2 mg/mL MTT reagent prepared
in sterile water (Amresco, product no. 0646C193) was added and incubated
for 4 h at 37 °C in the dark. After that, the plate was centrifuged
at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 220 μL
of the supernatant was discarded from each well and the formazan crystals
were dissolved in equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide by pipetting.
Absorbance of the formazan complex at 540 nm was measured using a
Tecan Infinite M 200 PRO plate reader. Each set of data (net absorbance)
was then expressed as percentage, considering the control group as
100% survival.
