Continuous
growth of high-quality single-layer graphene (SLG) is
highly desirable in several electronic and optoelectronic applications.
To fulfill such requirements, we proposed a low-cost, highly reproducible
high-quality SLG synthesized by indigenously developed low-pressure
chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) setup. The quality of SLG is examined
by Raman spectroscopy, where we have probed the I2D/IG ratio for continuous
30 runs to assess the reproducibility and quality of single-layer
using proposed indigenous LPCVD setup for device fabrication. The
highest I2D/IG ratio of SLG (5.82) was found with full width at half maximum values
of 2D peak and G peak of ∼30.10 cm−1 and
∼20.86 cm–1, respectively. Further, high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
have been performed to study the quality of SLG. Thickness measurement
of graphene with graphene grain size is calculated from atomic force
microscopy studies, and the average grain size is found to be 1–3
μm. Moreover, I–V characteristics
have also been investigated by the two-probe method to ensure the
quality of SLG. The lowest resistance of the SLG (∼387 Ω)
was found at room temperature. Thus, this new indigenously developed
low-cost setup provides a novel alternative method to produce highly
reproducible metrology-grade continuous SLG on Cu substrate for next-generation
quantum devices.

Introduction
In the last few years,
two-dimensional (2D) materials have been
the center of attraction for all scientific communities worldwide
due to their exceptional optical, chemical, physical, and structural
properties. The strategic synthesis and dimensions of a 2D material
control its characteristic properties to a large extent and the properties
may be easily tailored according to the desired applications.1−3

The last few years have witnessed many breakthroughs in 2D
materials,
especially in graphene research, owing to their significant advancement
in mass-scale production in a reproducible manner for quantum devices
to address practical applications.4 Graphene
is derived from exotic carbon forms having hexagonal lattice of monolayer
sp2-hybridized carbon atoms and is a semimetal in nature,
where charge carriers behave like Dirac fermions.5 Moreover, graphene exhibits outstanding electronic properties,
for example, high charge-carrier mobility, ∼200 000
cm2 V–1 s–1; tunable
band gap, ca. 0–2.5 eV; ballistic transport; and room-temperature
quantum Hall effect. In addition to these fascinating properties,
a very large theoretical specific surface area, ∼2630 m2 g–1, and the highest surface area-to-volume
ratio among the known 2D layered materials make it a potential material
for application in many quantum and optoelectronic devices. Furthermore,
graphene has very small Johnson noise due to its high conductivity
and transport properties (νF = 106 m s–1), which are desirable for many quantum devices in
practical applications.6 In spite of the
short history of 2D materials, graphene has established a dynamic
research area for new breakthrough in physics and novel potential
industrial applications.7 Various techniques
have been used so far to produce graphene on mass scale, for example,
mechanical exfoliation, chemical exfoliation, thermal decomposition
of silicon carbide, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and electrochemical
deposition technique.8−15 However, among these methods, CVD has been the most promising method
to produce large-scale, high-quality graphene in an inexpensive and
reproducible manner.16 Additionally, the
major advantage of this method is that CVD-synthesized graphene may
be transferred onto a desired arbitrary substrate with required dimension,
which is a major shortcoming in mechanically exfoliated graphene sheets.17 There are two types of the CVD method: atmospheric-pressure
CVD (APCVD) and low-pressure CVD (LPCVD). LPCVD is more advantageous
than the APCVD method to achieve continuous growth on Cu foils substrate
for high-quality single-layer graphene (SLG).18,19 As the mass transport velocity and the velocity of the reaction
on the surface are comparable, APCVD is highly complicated due to
different kinetics. As a result, an inhomogeneous graphene domain
could grow on Cu substrate, which deviates from our aim to deposit
single-layer graphene. In contrast, in LPCVD, there is an inverse
proportionality relationship between the diffusion of hydrocarbon
gases and pressure. This means that velocity of mass transport will
decrease, as a result of which the substrate will approach more closely
to hydrocarbon gas and the deposited films could grow with better
quality, scalability, and uniformity, which is desirable for single-layer
growth.18

Many important growth parameters
affect graphene growth on copper
substrate, such as gas flow rates, annealing/growth temperature, growth
pressure, and the ratio of carrier hydrogen to hydrocarbon gases used
for growth.20−22 Majority of the several reports published in the
area of SLG deposition by the LPCVD technique23−28 used the commercially available expensive LPCVD system to deposit
high-quality SLG. The major focus of the present work is to develop
an indigenous low-cost LPCVD system for high-quality metrological-grade
SLG growth in a reproducible manner.

In this study, we report
metrological-grade, low-cost, highly reproducible,
high-quality SLG synthesized by an indigenously developed LPCVD setup
after several statistical runs. The quality of SLG is investigated
by Raman and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
techniques to ensure the quality of single-layer deposited graphene
for 30 sequential runs with the same experimental parameters. Further,
to explore the feasibility of single-layer deposited graphene sample
for quantum devices, we have plotted I–V characteristics to ensure the quality of SLG transferred
on Si/SiO2 substrate.

Results and Discussion
Graphene is grown by the thermal LPCVD technique with low-cost
indigenously developed setup at CSIR-NPL, New Delhi, India. This LPCVD
setup was designed with a new concept of control of gas flow during
the growth and pretreatment of copper foil by using two calibrated
rotameters instead of a mass flow meter for argon and methane, as
well as only one mass flow meter for controlling hydrogen gas flow
to control the growth of SLG. Although majority of companies are using
the three mass flow meter concept for commercial use, we have developed
the strategic design and concept of replacing two mass flow meters
with a rotameter to reduce the cost of synthesis without compromising
the quality of highly reproducible SLG. The actual dimensions of the
setup (Figure 1) and
details are available at the “know how technology transfer” website of CSIR-NPL, New Delhi, India.29

Methane is a well-known precursor gas used by many
research groups30−35 for growth of SLG by the CVD method. Additionally, methane is a
reliable and primary source of carbon; hence, it is less reactive
due to the presence of a strong carbon bond (alkane) and its insusceptibility
to undergo chemical reaction, which make it more suitable for SLG
formation by dissociation at elevated temperature on copper substrate.
Further, it is well established that methane in diluted form produces
SLG and gives few layers of graphene in concentrated form.33 Therefore, the number of layers can be optimized
by varying the methane-to-hydrogen ratio. However, several other carbon
precursor gases were also used by many groups like acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), propene
(C3H6),36,37 etc., but the layer
formation is difficult to control in these cases.

Figure 1 Schematic of low-cost
indigenously developed CVD system for growth
of SLG on copper foil.

Several research groups have used various transition metals,
such
as cobalt (Co),38 nickel (Ni),38−40 iron (Fe),38,41 platinum (Pt),38,42,43 and copper (Cu),38−40 as catalyst
for growing high-quality graphene. However, Cu has been widely used
as a catalyst for the growth of SLG due to the lowest affinity of
carbon toward copper because it does not form any carbide phase and
has the lowest carbon solubility compared to other transition metals
(0.001–0.008 wt % at 1084 °C for copper, 0.6 wt % for
nickel at ∼1326 °C, and 0.9 wt % for cobalt at ∼1320
°C).38 The low reactivity of copper
with carbon is due to the fact that the former has a filled 3d electron
shell {[Ar] 3d104s1} with a highly stable configuration,
along with the half-filled 3d5, due to the symmetrical
electron distribution, which lowers the reciprocal repulsion. Because
of this, copper makes only soft bonds with carbon atoms through charge
transfer from the π orbitals in the sp2-hybridized
carbon to the empty 4s states of copper. Therefore, this unique combination
of low affinity between carbon and Cu and ability to make intermediate
soft bonds with carbon has made Cu a desired growth catalyst for graphitic
carbon formations.39 Hence, copper is a
more appropriate and versatile transition metal for use as catalyst
in CVD graphene synthesis. Figure 2a shows the image of copper foils of different sizes
after graphene growth by thermal LPCVD, while Figure 2b shows poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-coated
graphene floating on the surface of etching solution during transfer
and Figure 2c exhibits
after transfer on p-type doped Si with 300 nm thick SiO2 layer, respectively. After successful transfer of graphene, it is
further characterized by different characterization tools like optical
microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, TEM/HRTEM, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Figure 3a
shows
the optical image of the as-received copper foil, which indicates
clearly visible deep scratches and deep trenches on the rough Cu foil
due to the rolling process, while Figure 3b depicts the optical image of copper foil
after annealing at 950 °C. It has been observed that annealing
copper foil in an inert atmosphere of hydrogen (H2) and
argon (Ar) gases for 15 min produces a desired smooth surface for
growth of graphene. Under the present experimental conditions, we
have successfully recrystallized copper grain to a size greater than
100 μm, as shown in the optical image of annealed copper foil
(Figure 3b). Figure 3c depicts the optical
image of copper foil after graphene deposition. A continuous sheet
of graphene with lateral sizes same as the size of copper substrate
was synthesized by indigenously developed thermal LPCVD technique.
After growth, graphene was transferred from copper to Si/SiO2 substrate successfully by the wet chemical method. Figure 3d depicts the optical image
of graphene after it is transferred to Si/SiO2 substrate,
which shows a clean, continuous, and wrinkle-free transfer of graphene
on substrate. Also to observe the effect of annealing time on the
grain size of copper foil, i.e., the copper foil was annealed for
different time durations (1–40 min) with 5 min intervals. It
was observed that at different annealing times, grain size of more
than 100 μm was easily achieved, as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).

A number of experiments have been
performed to grow CVD graphene
by using our indigenously developed LPCVD system to inspect the quality
and reproducibility of high-quality SLG and further characterize these
samples using Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy is a noninvasive technique to investigate the
thickness (number of layers) and quality of LPCVD-grown graphene. Figure 4a,b shows the Raman
spectrum of graphene on Cu foil and on Si/SiO2 substrate,
respectively. The disorder-induced Raman D peak position at ∼1345.90
cm–1 is weak, which clearly signifies the quality
of graphene. The main G band, which is the first-order Raman band,
in graphene appears at ∼1583.12 cm–1, whereas
the 2D peak appears at ∼2683.32 cm–1. The
G band is due to in-plane doubly degenerate sp2 carbon–carbon
bond-stretching mode, which is attributed to the E2g irreducible
representation. This G band exists for every sp2 carbon
hybridized system, for example, graphite, amorphous carbon, and carbon
nanotubes. But the line shape of the G band differs on the basis of
the quality of the sample. The second-order Raman 2D or G′
peak results from the in-plane breathing mode of the hexagonal rings
of carbon atoms. 2D or G′ peak is the strongest peak in graphene,
which is attributed to the symmetric irreducible representation A′1 at the K or K′ point
in the first Brillouin zone. The 2D peak intensity is found to be
more than twice compared to the intensity of the G peak (the highest
being I2D/IG ∼ 5.82 as shown in Table 1) for most of the area of the graphene sample, indicating
overall SLG growth. The lowest ratio of intensities of defect D peak
and G peaks (ID/IG), i.e., ∼0.01 as shown in Table 1, indicates the high quality of graphene
with negligible defects. The highest I2D/IG of ∼5.82 was obtained with
the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of 2D and G peaks in
the Raman spectrum of graphene on Si/SiO2 of around 30.10
cm−1and 20.86 cm–1, respectively,
which is also in favor of SLG growth. Raman spectroscopy was performed
on all of the 30 samples grown in different statistical runs of LPCVD,
and it was found that in every growth process, high-quality SLG with
minimum defects was grown, as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Raman spectra of graphene on (a) Cu foil
and (b) Si/SiO2 substrate (sample A17).

Table 1 shows the
FWHM values and ratios of the intensities of 2D and G peaks of LPCVD-grown
graphene. The narrow FWHM of 2D peaks clearly signifies that LPCVD-grown
graphene was single-layer and of high crystal quality. Further, the
ratios of intensities, I2D/IG and ID/IG, clearly indicate that graphene was of high-quality
single-layer and with lower defect values. Raman studies also give
mobility of charge carriers in graphene using an empirical formula
between carrier mobility and FWHM of 2D peak shown in the Raman spectrum
of CVD graphene. The empirical formula of mobility is as follows 1  The highest calculated carrier mobility (μ)
of CVD-grown graphene is approximately 5797.69 cm2 V–1 s–1 with an FWHM of 2D peak of
around ∼30.10 cm–1 after transferred on Si/SiO2.

LPCVD-grown graphene
had been transferred onto holey carbon TEM
grid for analysis of microstructural morphology, crystallinity, and
the number of layers of LPCVD-grown graphene by using TEM techniques. Figure 5a shows the TEM image
of graphene, which shows folding of graphene layers on the TEM grid.
To investigate the number of graphene layers, HRTEM of graphene has
been performed on the TEM grid. Figure 5b shows the HRTEM image of graphene on the grid. The
HRTEM image shows that the graphene grown by thermal LPCVD system
is of single layer. Figure 5c shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
with 6-fold symmetry structure of graphene, which reveals the crystalline
nature of SLG. We can deduce that the LPCVD-grown graphene film is
predominantly SLG.

Figure S3 shows the X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy (XPS) image of graphene grown by thermal LPCVD on copper
foil for different elements, carbon and copper. Figure S3a shows the survey scan spectra and Figure S3b–d shows the spectra for C 1s, O 1s, Cu 2p3/2, and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. In Figure S3b, the peak at 284.6 eV corresponds
to the sp2 component of C–C bonding in graphene.
In Figure S3c, peaks at 530.2 and 531.8
eV correspond to binding energies of Cu2O and oxygen–hydrogen
related bond. Cu2O is known to form between CVD-grown graphene
and copper due to oxygen intercalation after the graphene/Cu sample
is removed from vacuum post growth and exposed to air. Figure S3d shows the XPS images of copper substrate
after growth of graphene and binding energies at 932.6 and 952.4 eV
corresponding to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2.

For thickness measurement, a torn part of graphene layer has been
selected, as shown in Figure S4a,b, and
the measured thickness of graphene was found to be 3.93 nm. The thickness
of graphene in AFM measurements is different from the precise thickness
of graphene (0.35 nm) due to molecule adsorption between the surface
of Si/SiO2 substrate and graphene layer in addition to
AFM instrument offset. Figure S5 shows
the AFM image of CVD-grown graphene with grain boundaries depicted
by yellow dotted lines. We can observe in Figure S5 that the average grain size lies in the range of ca. 1–3
μm. Indigenously developed CVD setup has a zone length of 6
in.; hence, the maximum size of continuous graphene synthesized in
this indigenously developed CVD is around 4.0 in × 2.0 in.

For device application of synthesized graphene, I–V measurement is the essential characteristic
to determine the quality and electronic properties of graphene. Hence, I–V measurement of SLG has been
performed on Si/SiO2 substrate with electrodes (Au/Ti =
90/10 nm). A two-probe station is used to investigate the electronic
properties of graphene at room temperature. As shown in Figure 6a prior to the I–V measurements, the graphene on device was
further characterized by Raman spectroscopy, which clearly shows that
there is no damage of graphene after device fabrication. The I2D/IG and ID/IG ratios (∼5.82
and ∼0.14, respectively) clearly indicate that quality of graphene
was maintained with lower defects even after device fabrication. As
shown in Figure 6b,
the typical linear behavior of current and voltage curves reveals
that the resistance of SLG is 387 Ω, which indicates high conductivity
of thermal LPCVD-grown graphene. The inset in Figure 6b shows the optical images of device used
for current–voltage measurements. The black circle shows the
area where the I–V measurement
has been performed. The width of electrode and the distance between
two electrodes were both 20 μm.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized
highly reproducible
SLG using indigenously developed LPCVD setup at low cost. The quality
of the synthesized SLG was confirmed through the standard Raman spectroscopy
method. The obtained Raman results clearly demonstrate that the as
grown samples exhibit high-quality SLG with I2D/IG > 2 for continuous 30
sequential
runs. Moreover, the highest I2D/IG ratio (5.82) of SLG was found with FWHM values
of 2D and G peaks of 30.10 cm−1 and 20.86 cm−1, respectively. Furthermore, the HRTEM result also
evidenced that the synthesized graphene is of single layer with good
quality. The XPS result also shows that the synthesized graphene has
good quality. Additionally, the AFM result ensures the continuous
growth of SLG with average grain size of ca. 1–3 μm.
The obtained I–V result shows
that the lowest resistance of SLG is ∼387 Ω. Hence, high-quality
SLG synthesized by using new indigenously developed low-cost CVD setup
would be an ultimate choice to industries for using graphene in new
emerging quantum devices.

Experimental Section
Thermal LPCVD Growth of
SLG on Cu Substrate
A quartz
tube of ID ∼ 61 mm, OD ∼ 65 mm, and length ∼
120 cm was placed in a horizontal single-zone split furnace for establishing
a low-cost thermal LPCVD system split furnace (Figure 1).

After cleaning of quartz tube, a
copper foil (Alfa Aesar, 99.999% metal basis, 25 μm thick) has
been placed on the alumina boat at the center of furnace. To control
the pressure inside the quartz tube, there is a controlling valve
attached with pressure gauge on the other end of the quartz tube,
which is connected to a rotary pump, and pressure was maintained at
0.1–1 torr by using a pressure-controlling valve. Flow of gases
(H2, CH4, and Ar) was controlled by using a
mass flow controller (MFC) and rotameters. The cost of LPCVD was reduced
approximately up to 1 million Indian rupees by using two calibrated
rotameters instead of MFCs for controlling the flow of CH4 and Ar gases. The copper foil was annealed for 15 min at 950 °C
in the presence of hydrogen (50 sccm) and argon gases by maintaining
a pressure ratio PH2/PAr of 7:1, and total pressure during annealing
was maintained below ∼16 Torr. After annealing, growth was
performed by introducing methane and hydrogen into the reactor with
hydrogen flow at 298 sccm, and a pressure ratio (PH2/PCH4) of 4:1 was maintained by injection of methane. During growth, flow
of argon gas is stopped, the total pressure of hydrogen and methane
gases inside the reactor was below 50 Torr, and growth was performed
for 10 min. After growth, the system was cooled in the presence of
hydrogen and argon in the pressure ratio as maintained during the
preannealing process, and the temperature profile of all of the processing
steps, including preannealing, annealing, growth, and cooling, is
shown in Figure 7.
Graphene-deposited copper foil was taken out of the reactor for further
characterizations and device fabrication.

preannealing, annealing, and growth of graphene.

Wet Chemical Method Using PMMA for Graphene Transfer on Si/SiO2 Substrate
Graphene grown on copper foil has been
successfully transferred onto Si/SiO2 substrate by the
wet chemical method using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, MicroChem
495, PMMA A2).

Figure 8 shows the stepwise schematic diagram for graphene transfer
from copper foil to Si/SiO2. PMMA was spin-coated on graphene-covered
Cu foil at 2500 rpm for 60 sec and baked at 170 °C for 1 min.
After baking, the PMMA-coated graphene/copper foil was floated in
diluted nitric acid solution for etching of copper foil. After etching,
we scoop out the PMMA−graphene membrane on Si/SiO2 substrate and on holey carbon-coated TEM grid and further clean
it with deionized water and isopropanol to remove acid content and
to dry graphene, respectively. Several dip and lift processes in boiling
acetone have been performed to remove the PMMA coating. Graphene on
copper, holey carbon TEM grid, and Si/SiO2 was further
characterized by optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, TEM / HRTEM,
and further I−V measurement was conducted on graphene transferred
onto Si/SiO2 using the two-probe method with gold electrodes
(Ti = 10 nm and Au = 90 nm) to measure the resistance of graphene.

steps involved in the transfer of graphene by the wet
chemical method.

Characterization of Graphene
Raman analysis of graphene
samples was performed to study the quality of graphene and the number
of layers in graphene by using a Renishaw inVia Raman spectrometer-I
by using 514.5 nm laser with a power of 5 mW with a 50× objective
lens. The structural properties of graphene were investigated using
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (model Tecnai G2
F30 STWIN) attached with a field emission gun. Electron diffraction
patterns were used to analyze the crystalline nature of graphene.
Electronic measurements were carried out using a Keithley 2634B source
unit. Optical images were captured at different resolutions by using
Olympus MX51. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed
to determine the chemical purity and elemental compositions of the
as-synthesized SLG, which was carried out in an ultra-high-vacuum
chamber equipped with a hemispherical electron energy analyzer (PerkinElmer,
PHI1257) using nonmonochromatized Al Kα source (1486.6 eV) with
a base pressure of 4 × 10–10 Torr at room temperature.
The surface topography, grain size, and thickness of SLG were examined
by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (model: 5500; Agilent Technologies).
