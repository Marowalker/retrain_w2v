We
report herein the development of a unique low-molecular-weight
gelator-induced technique for environmental remediation. The motive
of this work is wastewater purification using a gel-based toxic heavy
metal sequestration. The essence of this technique was to bring two
different functionalities, one capable of multiple coordination and
another with gel-forming ability, arranged in tandem within a single
ligand molecule. Naturally, the success of the approach depends on
whether the two tandem-arrayed functionalities are indeed working
in tandem. Our results show that the ligand molecule is an excellent
example of concomitant hydrogelator and metallogelator. The most interesting
aspects of this study involve the toxic metal sequestration of Pb,
Cd, and Hg which was further studied in detail with spectroscopic,
microscopic, and diffraction techniques. We also report here a rare
property of pure organic hydrogel-to-metallogel transformation which
could open up a new avenue on wastewater purification. In essence,
the hydrogels can be envisaged as a unique class of metal-free zeolite
analogue for environmental remediation not by just absorbance but
through absorbance cum coordination, which are further corroborated
by the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy results.

==== Body
Introduction
An intriguing correlation
between environment and us is that 70%
of both human body and earth is made of water.1,2 Correlation
does not imply causation. Notwithstanding, any damage to the most
important and ubiquitous ingredient of environment, that is, water,
therefore literally can be conceived as a serious self-inflicted body
blow for us.3 Perhaps, that is how Mother
Nature restores the balance. Unfortunately, this very balance of the
nature has now moved into uncharted waters by our ever increasing
lifestyle and subsequent industrial progress.4,5 However,
progress comes at a price; a staggering amount of industrial wastes
laden with hazardous toxic metals are dumped in water everyday.6 Needless to mention, the presence of such contaminated
water in the form of three-quarters of our body can wreck havoc.7,8 Of particular concern is the nonbiodegradable heavy metal ions such
as Pb, Cd, or Hg, which can cause serious damage to the central nervous
system, kidneys, and immune system of human beings once accumulated
beyond a permissible concentration in the body.9,10 Further
corroborations come from some extensively publicized and well-documented
massacres caused by water pollution-related diseases such as Minamata
or itai-itai.11,12 Naturally as a preventive measure,
removal of such toxic metals from wastewater warrants remediation
prior to their disposal in navigable waters or land. A number of techniques
for wastewater treatments have been developed over the years including
biological treatment, separation, ion-exchange, chemical and electrochemical
techniques, and adsorption procedures.13−27 However, these processes suffer from several disadvantages, such
as incomplete removal, high cost including costly regeneration processes,
and high energy requirements.28 Therefore,
development of cheaper and more effective methods to treat wastewater
has become a matter of utmost importance in contemporary environmental
research.29,30

Metals

Among the other methods, gel-based
adsorptions of toxic metals
are considerable promise to environmental remediation.31−39 A popular yet emerging approach includes metallogelation where metal-coordinated
network entraps sufficiently large amount of solvent to restrict solid-state
aggregation.40,41 Because of strong coordination
bonds, once bound, the metals do not leave their sites under ambient
conditions. This should lead to a highly stable toxic metal capturing
process with improved wastewater purification. It is noteworthy here
that arresting a heavy metal-coordinated network in the gel state
especially using low-molecular-weight gelators itself is a formidable
task. Needless to say, successful execution of such a task primarily
depends on the ligand design.42−46 Any judicious design of a heavy metal gelator offers a three-pronged
challenge: first, to fit with functional groups containing multiple
coordinating sites similar to a typical toxic metal capturing agent;
second, the spatial arrangement of functionalities should ensure forming
a highly cross-linked, intertwined, three-dimensional network; and
finally, to modify the chassis of the ligand particularly the noncoordinating
part with functionalities capable of immobilizing a large amount of
solvent molecules within the framework, thus fulfilling the most important
prerequisite of gelation.47 In a nutshell,
the two-in-one ligand should be a heavy metal capturing agent that
also capable of gelation.48

In our
quest for a cheaper and more efficient gel-based method
for environmental remediation, we developed a novel pyridine–pyrazole-based
amide molecule, namely, N2,N6-bis(5(3)-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3(5)-carbonyl)-pyridine-2,6-dicarbohydrazide
(BP3D). With the concomitant presence of multiple chelating and solvent
immobilizer, functional groups BP3D is deemed to be the best choice
for the present study. The two dangling pyridyl–pyrazole moieties
of the BP3D molecule alongside a central pyridine ring perfectly suited
for metal capturing, whereas converging chelating units at the two
ends prevents detrimental coordination polymer formation.49,50 On the other hand, deliberate introduction of diamide groups in
the backbone of BP3D is bound to immobilize a greater amount of solvent
molecule, further enhancing the possibility of gel formation. Indeed,
a BP3D molecule shows an unprecedented ability to gel toxic heavy
metals such as Pb, Cd, and Hg. It is noteworthy here that to the best
of our knowledge, a low-molecular-weight gelator-based removal of
Pb, Cd, and Hg from wastewater has hitherto not been reported in the
literature. We also report here a unique event of supramolecular hydrogel-to-metallohydrogel
transformation in the presence of heavy metal salt which has potential
applications in gel-based water purification via heavy metal filtering.

Results
and Discussion
The titular gelator, BP3D, can be prepared
in high yields by the
reaction of 3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carbohydrazide
with 2,6-pyridinedicarbonyl dichloride in a dry acetonitrile medium.

It was abundantly clear that success of our work heavily depends
on the spatial orientation of both coordinating and H-bonding functional
groups. A two prong pendent orientation of the pyridine–pyrazole
moiety would be the most favorable one with enhanced ligand–solvent
interaction and a better metal-driven cross-linking network. Naturally,
we were interested to know the relative orientation of the functional
groups. Fortunately, after numerous attempts, we have been successful
in generating diffraction quality single crystals of the ligand from
a methanol/dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent system. The crystal structure
(monoclinic, C2/c) (Figure 1a) indeed shows a pendent orientation
of the coordinating groups with extensive hydrogen bonding and other
intermolecular interactions.51 The three-dimensional
supramolecular self-assembly, on the other hand, is dominated by interlocked
π–π stacking of aromatic rings in a head-to-tail
arrangement (Figure 1b).

Figure 1 Crystal structure of BP3D showing (a) two prong pendent arrangement
of functional groups and (b) supramolecular self-assembly along the c axis.

Although dual purposes
for BP3D design involve heavy metal capturing
and subsequent metallogelation, it is only prudent to test whether
it can form a gel on its own. Indeed, the presence of two bisamide
groups makes their mark, and a transparent colorless hydrogel (Figure 2 inset) named here G-L was formed at 1 wt % BP3D concentration in the dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)/water solvent mixture with the formation of a fibrillar
structure, as supported by microscopic data (Figure 2). BP3D is soluble only in DMF or DMSO. Here,
for all of the gelation tests, we have used DMSO as a cosolvent because
it is comparatively safer to use. Increasing the wt % makes the gel
stronger but makes the gel opaque as well.

prepared by 1 wt % BP3D ligand. The inset
shows a picture of transparent hydrogel G-L.

Unprecedented Hydrogel-to-Metallohydrogel Transformation
Having confirmed the gelation ability of BP3D, we proceed to the
next obvious task that is to find out whether the two tandem-arrayed
functionalities targeting multiple coordination and gelation are indeed
working in tandem in the presence of a heavy metal. In other words,
although solvent immobilizer functionalities are individually actively
engaged in supramolecular hydrogel formation, we were interested to
see whether concurrent metal coordination of chelating functionalities
are also possible in the same gel state. Another point of interest
is to check the sustainability of the gel state after metal coordination.
It was gratifying to observe that both chelating and gelator functionalities
of BP3D are indeed working in tandem and led to a unique event of
gel-to-gel transformation or more precisely a postgelation gelator–metal
coordination-driven hydrogel-to-metallohydrogel transformation. To
assess the role of chelating functionalities in the gel state, aqueous
solution of colorless metal salts of lead was added on top of the
colorless hydrogel G-L. As expected for a routine chemical
responsive test, within few minutes, the color of the gel–sol
interface turned into yellow, signifying metal complex formation at
the upper surface as it came in contact with the metal. Subsequent
events, however, were beyond our expectation as the color change does
not just stop at the interface but shows an unprecedented downward
trend with time. As illustrated in Figure 3a, with time, the increasing upper portion gradually turned into yellow color, whereas the diminishing lower portion retained the original colorless
state of the mother gel. A tube inversion test further confirms that
the yellow colored upper portion is indeed a gel (Figure 3b). Even after the complete
transformation of the gel, it was able to hold its weight when the
tube was inverted, further reinforcing the notion of gel-to-gel transformation.
Similar transformation was also observed for mercury, albeit at a
slower pace (Figures S37 and S38). For
Cd, no color change was observed; however, distinct change in morphology
implies that transformation might have occurred (Figure 4). For transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), we have taken sample from the column of 1 week old
column of those transformed metallogel. All of them clearly show the
growth of nanoscale metal–organic particles (NMOPs) which start
from the fiber. The growth of Pb NMOP is a bit different from other
two. For Pb, first, a nanoball of approximate diameter of around 500
nm is formed from fibers in the presence of Pb ion. Then, crystalline
NMOPs start to form around it. For Hg and Cd, the NMOP starts to form
directly from fibers and also they are noncrystalline (Figure 5). It is noteworthy here that
to the best of our knowledge, such kind of hydrogel-to-metallogel
transformation in the presence of toxic metal salt solution has hitherto
not been reported in the literature.

transformations,

right more zoomed
in images. Pb gel (a–c), Hg gel (d–f), and Cd gel (g–i).

transformation.

The obvious questions
then arise: does BP3D forms metallogel under
normal gelation methods? Are these metallogels identical to those
of transformed metallogel? Subsequent experiments give affirmative
answers. BP3D does form strong metallogels in the presence of Pb,
Cd, and Hg metal salts (named G-Pb, G-Cd, and G-Hg) when standard metallogelation experiments
were also carried out separately. Most importantly, comparison of
the experimental data confirms that metallogels obtained from the
standard method are almost identical to those of the transformed metallogels.
However, in order to avoid any confusion, the experimental results
of metallogels reported hereafter are those synthesized from standard
methods. A general strategy was adopted for standard metallogelation
experiments. Aqueous solutions of metal salts were added to a DMSO
solution of the ligand, by shaking the sample and leaving it to stand
for a few minutes formed stable, opaque/clear metallogels (confirmed
by the tube inversion test). A Pb metallogel (G-Pb) is
formed at a critical gelation concentration of 0.5 wt % after a few
minutes of addition of 2 equiv of lead salts. BP3D with Pb(OAc)2 formed the best Pb gel at 1 wt % ligand concentration with
2 equiv of Pb salt in the DMSO/water solvent mixture (ratio DMSO/water
= 1:4). Best Hg gel (G-Hg) was formed at 1 wt % ligand
with 2 equiv of Hg(OAc)2 salt in the DMSO/water solvent
mixture (ratio DMSO/water = 2:3). Best Cd gel (G-Cd)
was formed at 1 wt% ligand with 2 equiv of Cd(NO3)2 salt in the DMSO/water solvent mixture (ratio DMSO/water
= 2:3). G-Pb was formed instantly within few second of
mixing of ligand and salt solution, but it takes longer time for G-Hg and few hours for G-Cd to form, though few
minutes of sonication makes it much faster. Interestingly, although
above gel state could not be achieved from water alone but higher
percentage of water facilitates the gel formation. Both hydrogel and
metallohydrogels were stable under ambient conditions on a bench top
over several weeks (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Images of (a) G-Hg, (b) G-Pb, and (c) G-Cd at 1 wt % concentration.

The formation of gel state can be attributed to supramolecular
interactions such as H-bonding and π–π stacking
among solvent and gelator molecules. Comparative Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy study of ligand and xerogels (Figures S4–S7) was carried out to ascertain
the role of diamide and pyridine–pyrazole functional groups
in the self-assembly process en route to gelation. In general, decrease
in N–H and C=O stretching frequency and increase in
N–H bending frequency indicate enhanced intermolecular interactions
between amide groups. The ligand, BP3D, shows strong adsorption bands
at 3434, 1659, and 1518 cm–1 which are due to amide
N–H stretching, C=O stretching, and amide N–H
bending, respectively. Enhanced intermolecular interactions in the
gel state are due to the involvement of C=O and amide N–H
group. Decrease in frequency for N–H stretching is a recurring
theme as we move on to metallogels, and for Pb, Hg, and Cd xerogels,
it appears at 3409, 3412, and 3408 cm–1, respectively.
As expected, amide N–H bending frequency, on the other hand,
increases to 1528, 1566, and 1519 cm–1 for Pb, Hg,
and Cd xerogels. For Pb and Cd, the C=O stretching frequency
decreases to 1636 and 1605 cm–1; this indicates
two possibilities. First, O of C=O coordinated to metal, and
second, O is involved in H-bonding formation. On the other hand, C=O
stretching frequency remains almost same for Hg at 1661 cm–1. Increasing the value of stretching frequency of C=O indicates
that there is a decrease in the extent of H-bonding. This is only
possible when there is two types of C=O present in the ligand,
one of them is participating in H-bonding as well as metal coordination
and other is inactive.

G-Pb is much more stronger
than G-Hg and G-Cd, even stronger than G-L (Figure 7a). This indicates that stronger
ligand–metal coordination bond and more H-bonding are present
in G-Pb than those in the other metallogels. This is
corroborated from the rheology data. All of the rheology experiments
were performed with the gels formed at 1 wt % ligand concentration.
All four gels are stable up to 10 Pa stress (Figures S26–S29). After that, G-L, G-Hg, and G-Cd start breaking. G-L transforms
into sol at 27.29 Pa. G-Hg and G-Cd transform
into sol at a bit lower stress value, that is, 25.45 and 18.09 Pa,
respectively. G-Pb transforms into sol at 153.9 Pa stress.
From the rheology data, we can confirm that G-Pb is indeed
stronger than the G-Hg gel. G-Pb also shows
distinct thixotropic behavior in contrast to others (Figure 7b).

Figure 7 (a) Comparison between
stress sweep rheology of hydrogel and G-Pb and (b) thixotropic
behavior of G-Pb.

The unusual ability of the BP3D-based hydrogel G-L to sequester toxic heavy metals from water via metal–ligand
coordination has many implications and was studied in detail using
various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. For example, the
UV–vis spectrum of the free ligand and subsequent titration
with metal salts with corroborative Job’s plots clearly supports
the metal–ligand complex formation. UV–vis titration
was performed using a 1 × 10–4 M solution of
ligand in 1:1 DMSO/water with aliquots of 1 × 10–3 M metal salt solutions. The free ligand shows a strong band at 280
nm which could be assigned to π–π* transition.
A gradual red shift of this band is a recurrent theme upon sequential
addition of metal salts. For Hg, a maximum shift to 298 nm was observed
after the addition of 4 equiv for Hg salt. For Pb, the peak is red
shifted to around 288 nm with the addition of 2 equiv salts. Subsequent
addition of metals does not bring any change to the peak position
(Figure 8). For Cd,
however, the change in peak positions is not so prominent which suggest
that the Cd–BP3D complex is structurally different from Hg
and Pb complex (Figure S3). On the other
hand, a broad band appears at around 350 nm for Hg and at around 340
nm for Pb which may be due to the intraligand charge transfer. For
Cd, also, a very broad band appears at around 345 with increasing
intensity.

(b) Job’s Plot.

Further insight in favor of the notion of metal–ligand
coordination-driven
gel-to-gel transfer comes from the NMR spectroscopic studies. A comparative
depiction of 1H NMR spectra of metallogels (Figures S10, S12, and S14) compared to that of
ligand (Figure S8) is consistent with the
literature and shows a common trend of downfield shift and broadening
of signals for amide and aromatic protons. The downfield shift and
broadening of N–H protons (amide N–H and pyrazole N–H)
can be attributed to the extensive H-bonding in the gel state (Figure 9). One the other
hand, similar downfieldness features of aromatic protons are characteristic
feature of metallogels signifying the interaction between aromatic
pi-ring and metals during gelation, while further corroboration comes
from the 13C NMR spectra (Figures S9, S11, S13, and S15).

Figure 9 Comparison between 1H NMR spectra
of BP3D and Pb metallogel.

We sought further insight into the microscopic results of G-L, G-Pb, G-Hg, and G-Cd to confirm the metallogel produced from the standard procedure is
more or less identical to that of transformed metallogels. Detailed
morphologies of the gels were studied with field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) and TEM, and atomic force microscopy (AFM)
techniques. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph of a
freshly prepared G-L showed the presence of a highly
entangled cross-linked fibrillar network with each fibril of infinite
length and an average diameter of 20 nm (Figure 2). The individual fibers were found to further
assemble to generate bundled aggregates that closely resemble ribbons.
In a stark contrast, the metallogels show completely different morphologies.
SEM and TEM images of G-Pb showed an interesting rhombus-shaped
NMOPs of diagonal size of approximately 250 and 300 nm along with
fiber-like nature (a diameter of ca. 8 nm) (Figure 10a–c,h,k). The formation of NMOPs
was further confirmed by AFM micrographs and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDAX) analysis which was found to contain both the ligand
and the metal elements (Figure S16). On
the other hand, appearances of only NMOPs in G-Hg (Figure 10d,e,i,l) and G-Cd (Figure 10f,g,j,m) vis-à-vis normal fibril network in G-L only seems to confirm that this is a dynamic ligand–metal
coordination-driven transformation process rather than mere coexistence
of two morphologies. For both the metallogels showed no fiber nature,
only round-shaped NMOP with an approximate size of 30 nm is visible
in the microscopy images. Few particles are even smaller and in the
range of 10–20 nm. Interestingly, on the other hand, size of
Cd NMOP varies around 70 nm. The selected-area electron diffraction
(SAED) patterns of the Hg and Cd NMOPs revealed amorphous nature in
comparison to high level of crystallinity in Pb-based NMOPs (Figures S17, S19, and S20).

Toxic Heavy Metal Sequestration
Finally, above singular
hydrogel-to-metallohydrogel transformation opens up a new avenue on
wastewater purification. In essence, the hydrogel represents a unique
class of metal-free zeolite analogue for environmental remediation
not by just absorbance but through absorbance cum coordination. The
inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)
data of metal concentration taken during above transformation will
put this into perspective (Table 1). Experiments were carried out adding metal solutions
of known concentration on top of the hydrogel column of 2 mL and 1
wt % concentration. Our intention was to study the possibility of
developing a simple but efficient low-cost G-L column
that could be used as toxic heavy metal sequestration through mere
filtering. Subsequently, the aliquots were taken from time to time
and measured for metal concentrations. The transformation rate for
Cd was really slow, and subsequent changes in concentrations were
insignificant. On the other hand, concentration of Pb shows a downward
trend from an initial 301.5 to 205.1 mg/L after 15 days to an impressive
43.34 mg/L (85.63% removal) after 3 months. Similar trend was also
observed for Hg with a reduction of concentration from 24.12 to 12.27
mg/L after first 15 days and as low as 0.011 mg/L (99.95% removal)
after 3 months. Of course, the loss in metal concentration on the
upper solution layer was the gain in the lower gel state as evident
from a distinctive color change. As illustrated in Figure 3a, with time as the transformation
brings about a gradual change of color of the column from colorless
to bright yellow. The lower concentration of metal simply means lower
amount of toxic metals in the residual water and thus vindicate our
plan of using hydrogel column for water purification.

Conclusions
As a part of our quest on environmental remediation, we have developed
a unique gel-based toxic heavy metal sequestration technique. The
task was achieved with the design of a two-in-one ligand molecule
combining the basic characteristics of a heavy metal capturing agent
and low-molecular-weight gelator molecule. The motive was wastewater
purification through heavy metal gelation. Accordingly, a pyridine–pyrazole-based
two prong pendent ligand (BP3D) fitted with multiple number of coordinating
sites for heavy metal capturing, and two diamide arms for gelation
were synthesized and utilized. Both functional groups work in tandem
and show an unusual gelation of toxic heavy metals such as Pb, Cd,
and Hg. Interestingly, above metallogelation of toxic metals can also
be achieved via an unprecedented metal–ligand coordination-driven
hydrogel-to-metallohydrogel transformation. To the best of our knowledge,
such kind of transformation hitherto has not been reported in the
literature but has a huge potential application in gel-based wastewater
purification simply by using hydrogel column as a filter. We are currently
working on improving the efficiency and the rate of toxic metal removal
which will be communicated in our future endeavor.

Experimental
Section
Materials
All reagent grade materials and organic solvents
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, and Merck and used
without further purification. Double distilled water was used for
all experiments except in the case of ICP-OES experiment where Milli-Q
water was used.

General Experiments
Hydrogel (G-L) Formation
In a 5 mL vial,
BP3D (10 mg, 0.019 mmol) was dissolved into 0.5 mL of DMSO. H2O (0.5 mL) was added to it under stirring. It was sonicated
for few minutes to form a transparent colorless hydrogel.

Pb Metallohydrogel
(G-Pb) Formation
In
a 5 mL vial, BP3D (10 mg, 0.019 mmol) was dissolved into 0.2 mL of
DMSO. An aqueous solution of Pb(OAc)2 (14 mg, 0.037 mmol
in 0.8 mL H2O) was added to it under stirring. Solution
turns yellow color and transforms into strong gel after few seconds.

Hg Metallohydrogel (G-Hg) Formation
In
a 5 mL vial, BP3D (10 mg, 0.019 mmol) was dissolved into 0.4 mL of
DMSO. An aqueous solution of Hg(OAc)2 (11.84 mg, 0.037
mmol in 0.6 mL H2O) was added to it under stirring. Solution
turns greenish yellow color. It was sonicated for few minutes and
transforms into gel.

Cd Metallohydrogel (G-Cd) Formation
In
a 5 mL vial, BP3D (10 mg, 0.019 mmol) was dissolved into 0.4 mL of
DMSO. An aqueous solution of Cd(NO3)2 (8.79
mg, 0.037 mmol in 0.6 mL H2O) was added to it under stirring.
It was sonicated for few minutes and transforms into colorless gel.

NMR Spectroscopy
1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded on Bruker spectrometers operating at 400 and
500 MHz dissolving the compounds in the DMSO-d6 solvent. The chemical shift data are reported in units of
δ (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane and referenced with residual
DMSO.

X-ray Crystallography
X-ray diffraction intensities
for the BP3D crystal was collected at room temperature on Bruker APEX-2
CCD and diffractometer using Mo Kα radiation and processed using
SAINT. The structures were solved by direct methods in SHELXS and
refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 in SHELXL.52 We are unable to exactly locate H-atoms attached with N4
and therefore omitted in the CIF file. Crystallographic data are summarized
in ref (51), and CIF
files for the structures reported in this paper have been deposited
with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC). Deposition
numbers are given in ref (51). Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) patterns were collected
at ambient temperature using a Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE diffractometer.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
A small amount of sample
was placed on a clean glass slide and then dried by slow evaporation.
The material was then allowed to dry under vacuum at 30 °C for
2 days. The materials were silver-coated, and the micrographs were
taken in FESEM apparatus Jeol Scanning Microscope-JSM-6700F and Carl
Zeiss AG SUPRA 55 VP-41-32.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
A small amount of
sample was placed in a glass vial. Ethanol (1 mL) was added to it,
and the vial was sonicated for few hours. Then, 1 drop of this solution
was drop casted on a 300 mesh carbon-coated copper grid, and it was
mounted on a Jeol JEM 2010 HRTEM.

Rheology
Rheological
measurements were taken on an
Anton Paar MCR 102 Rheometer with a 25 mm parallel plate. The gap
was fixed at 300 μm. A gel sample was preformed in a 5 mL vial
and transferred onto the Peltier plate. All measurements were performed
at 25 °C. The stress sweep study was performed with a stress
ramp from 0.1 to 200 Pa at an angular frequency of 6.284 rad/s. The
thixotropic experiment with G-Pb was carried out using
a five-step process. Here, we determine change of storage modulus
(G′) and loss (G″)
modulus with respect to time. First, when 0.05% strain is applied,
it shows its gel property. Then, when 30% strain is applied, it transforms
into sol. When we remove the higher strain, it goes back to gel state.
Same cycle was repeated for one more time.

Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical
Emission Spectroscopy
ICP-OES measurements were taken on
a PerkinElmer Optima 2100 DV.
Mercury Standard for ICP was used for the generation of calibration
curve before the measurement of the amount of mercury in the aliquot.
Multielement standard for ICP was used for generation of calibration
curve before the measurement of the amount of Pb and Cd separately.

Other Experimental Methods
FT-IR spectra were performed
on a Nicolet MAGNA-IR 750 spectrometer with the KBr pellets containing
the samples. UV–visible studies were performed in a PerkinElmer
Lambda 950 UV–vis instrument. The elemental analyses were carried
out using a PerkinElmer 2400 Series-II CHN analyzer.

Synthetic
Procedure
Synthesis of BP3DH
BP3D was prepared by the reaction
of 3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carbohydrazide
with 2,6-pyridinedicarbonyl dichloride. 2,6-Pyridinedicarbonyl dichloride
(2.04 g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in dry acetonitrile and to it 3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carbohydrazide (10.75 g, 20 mmol) was added,
giving an immediate white suspension. The reaction mixture was refluxed
overnight at 80 °C, cooled, and filtered. The precipitate was
washed with acetonitrile and dried in vacuum. To the suspension of
the hydrochloride salt in water, was added saturated sodium bicarbonate
