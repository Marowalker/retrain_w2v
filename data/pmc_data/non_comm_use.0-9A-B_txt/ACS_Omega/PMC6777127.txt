Lysozyme is a well-characterized
protein in terms of its structure,
dynamics, and functions. It has thus emerged as a potential target
to understand protein–drug interactions. The aim of our study
is to gain a biophysical outlook on the interaction of lysozyme (Lyz),
a well-known model protein, with Noscapine, a potent tubulin-binding
anticancer drug. Noscapine (Nos) is effective against a wide range
of cancer and shows low toxicity and few side effects. We report the
underlying mechanism of complex formation between Nos and Lyz using
spectroscopic and advanced computational avenues. The spectroscopic
techniques, that is, absorption and steady-state and time-resolved
fluorescence, proved that Lyz–Nos forms a complex, and the
quenching mechanism was of the static type. The binding constant was
in the order of 103 indicative of moderate binding, while
the stoichiometry of the protein–drug complex was 1:1 at 298
K. The secondary structural analysis using CD and UV thermal denaturation
further confirmed the conformational changes in the protein upon binding
with Nos. Molecular dynamics simulation studies confirmed the stable
binding with minimum deviations in RMSD. The above conclusions are
significant to the development of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic
properties of Nos, and its successful interaction with a versatile
protein like Lyz will help in overcoming its previous limitations.

==== Body
Introduction
Noscapine (Nos) is a phthalideisoquinoline
alkaloid found in the
plant family of opium poppy. This non-narcotic drug has been significantly
researched due to its potency against various types of cancer.1 The similarity in structure of Nos (Figure 1) to colchicine and
podophyllotoxin led to the exploration of its binding with tubulin
proteins. It was successfully demonstrated that the interaction of
Nos with tubulins leads to the alteration of the microtubule assembly,
causing mitotic arrest.2 Recently, Nos
and its halogenated analogs have been biosynthesized using microbial
fermentation, and it is a major step toward industrial production.3 The drug is emerging as a viable anticancer agent
already undergoing clinical trial in phase I/II.4 Although it has a low-toxicity profile, the high-dosage
requirement and low bioavailability have impeded its development as
a commercially available drug. Several alternative methods for Nos
drug delivery, including nanoparticles,5,6 soluble complexes,7 etc., have been reported, and the investigation
is still underway to find the most suitable pathway to overcome the
pharmacokinetic limitations. In order to aid the potency of the compound
for cancer treatment, drug–protein binding studies are vital
to assess its delivery and homing to specific target points.8,9 Previously, Nos and its analogues have been explored for their interaction
with blood proteins (BSA and HSA) and pharmacological properties using
biophysical approaches to aid reports on the potency of the compound
for cancer treatment.10−13

structure of Noscapine.

Biophysical studies provide
deep insight into the drug interaction,
in vivo half-life, solubility, efficacy, toxicity, heme metabolism,
clearance, and elimination from the body.14−18 Therefore, it is necessary to study the biophysical
parameters of the drug. Considering that fact and a literature survey,
in this work, we have performed the binding mechanistic interaction
studies of Nos with Lyz abundantly present in the body secretion.
Hen egg-white lysozyme, an easily available and low-cost protein,
is used as a model system due to its structural similarity (∼60%
homology) to human lysozyme. Lyz is a small globular monomeric protein
(129 amino acid residues, mol wt = 14.3 kDa) with six tryptophan and
three tyrosine residues with four disulfide linkages providing structural
stability.19 It has innumerable biologically
and pharmaceutically important functions, including anti-inflammatory,20 antimicrobial,21 and
antiviral functions.22 One of the most
important functions of Lyz is its ability to transport drugs. In view
of this property, the binding of Nos with Lyz was deciphered using
different spectroscopic and in silico techniques. UV–visible
and steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy elucidated
the mechanism of binding, while circular dichroism spectroscopy offered
an insight into the secondary structural changes upon interaction.
Molecular docking has been performed to calculate binding free energy
and interaction sites; molecular dynamic simulations have been used
to assess the stability of the binding as many reports have employed
to give a mechanistic interaction of regulatory networks.23 Molecular docking simulation analysis provides
detailed information of the interaction at the atomic level of proteins
by analyzing the protein conformations and root-mean-square deviations.
Drug dynamics and stability parameters are potential factors to determine
the biological functionality of the drug and specific binding of the
drug to the binding grove of oncotargets.24,25 Since Lyz is extracted from the hen egg white, a boiled egg assay
was also performed, an in silico technique to evaluate the gastrointestinal
absorption and blood–brain barrier penetration potential. Overall,
our current study offers a detailed outlook into the binding of Nos
with Lyz, which will be useful in moving closer to realizing its full
anticancer potential.

Results and Discussion
Absorption Spectroscopy
UV–visible spectroscopy
is one of the most important techniques used to analyze drug–protein
interactions. The absorption spectra of Lyz shows a characteristic
peak at 281 nm, which is due to the π–π* transition
of the three aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine.26,27 The spectra of Lyz were recorded in the absence and presence of
Nos to understand the mechanism of interaction (Figure 2). It can be seen that the absorbance of
Lyz increases with the addition of Nos without any significant peak
shift. Thus, it can be deduced that Lyz interacts with Nos. UV titration
experiments are also employed to gain insight about the mode of interaction
between the protein and ligands/drugs, that is, whether the drug is
interacting with macromolecules via electrostatic interaction or intercalation.
It is done to see if any wavelength shift occurs in the experiment
along with any hypochromicity/hyperchromicity. But in our experiment,
only hyperchromicity is observed without any shift in wavelength.
So, it might be possible that the drug is exposing the tryptophan
moiety by interacting as well as forming a complex with the protein.

presence of Nos at different concentrations: (a) 0, (b) 15, (c) 30,
(d) 45, (e) 60, (f) 75, (g)90, (h) 105, and (i) 120 μM.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Proteins
have the unique
property of showing fluorescence,28 which
has greatly simplified the understanding of their structural and conformational
changes during complex formation.29 The
amino acids responsible for their fluorescent properties are tryptophan,
tyrosine, and phenylalanine.30 To elucidate
the mechanism of interaction between Lyz and Nos, the fluorescence
spectra of Lyz in the absence and presence of the drug was carefully
studied. Lyz shows an emission peak at 340 nm (Figure 3) at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm,
and this fluorescence was quenched by the successive addition of Nos.
Now, it is possible that the decrease in fluorescence can proceed
via a static or dynamic mechanism. The two modes responsible can be
differentiated on the basis of the value of the quenching constant.
In general, static quenching is responsible when there is complex
formation, while dynamic quenching comes into play due to collisional
encounters. The binding mechanism was assessed by evaluating the fluorescence
spectra using the Stern–Volmer equation31 (eq 1). 1  

Figure 3 Fluorescence
quenching spectra of Lyz (15 μM) in the presence
of Nos (0 to 120 μM) at 298 K.

The symbol Fo denotes the fluorescence
intensity of pure Lyz, while F is the intensity in
the presence of Nos. [Q] is the concentration of
Nos in M, τo is the average lifetime of a biomolecule,
and Ksv and Kq are the Stern–Volmer constant and quenching constant, respectively. Kq is calculated simply by assuming the value
of τo to be 10–8 s.32 The value of Kq (Table 1) was found to be
higher than the maximum diffusion rate constant for biomolecules,33 in our case, proteins (2 × 1010 L mol–1 s–1). It can be concluded
that the mechanism of quenching was due to the complex formation between
Lyz and Nos.

and Binding Parameters of the Lyz–Nos System at Room Temperature

Kb (L mol–1)	1.41 × 103	
The fluorescence
data was further evaluated to determine the binding
constant and the number of binding sites by following the modified
Stern–Volmer equation34 (eq 2). 2  

Here, Kb is the binding constant
and n represents the number of binding sites.

When eq 2 was used
to plot the fluorescence data of the Lyz–Nos interaction, it
was seen that the plot was linear and the slope came out to be 0.9,
and the intercept gave the value for Kb. The Stern–Volmer and modified Stern–Volmer plots
have been depicted in Figure 4. The binding constant was in the order of 103 (L
mol–1) showing a moderate and reasonable binding,
while the near-unity value of n (n = 0.9) shows the 1:1 stoichiometry of the Lyz–Nos complex.
The UV–visible results were also in coherence with the steady-state
fluorescence analysis because if the quenching was dynamic, the absorbance
spectra would be unaltered.

complex system
at 298 K. (B) Plot of log () versus [Nos] for the Lyz–Nos system
at 298 K.

Time-Resolved Fluorescence
The mechanism of quenching
was concluded to be static based on steady-state fluorescence. Time-resolved
fluorescence spectra can also be used to differentiate between static
or dynamic quenching for any protein–drug interaction. When
the quenching is static, the lifetime of the fluorophore remains unchanged
in the presence of the ligand, while for dynamic quenching, a change
is observed.35,36 On recording the spectra (Figure 5), it was seen that
the lifetime of Lyz (1.8 ns) remained the same even in the presence
of different concentrations of Nos (Table 2). Thus, the reason for the
quenching of Lyz in the presence of the drug can be attributed to
a static type.

of
Nos at different concentrations.

UV-Thermal
Denaturation
UV-Tm experiments have very
important implications in interaction studies. It plays a significant
role in interpreting the stabilizing/destabilizing effect of the ligand
on biomolecules (protein, DNA, etc.). In the present study, the UV
Tm of Lyz is monitored in the absence as well as in the presence of
Nos. Figure 6 displays
an inverted melting profile for Lyz in the absence as well as in the
presence of a varied concentration of Nos. The thermal melting profile
of Lyz is manifested with a melting temperature of 77 °C. On
addition of Nos in the varied ratio (i.e., 1:1 and 1:2), a decrease
in the melting temperature was observed, that is, 73 °C, which
reflects destabilization of the protein. It might be possible that
Nos interacts with the protein via intercalation to the hydrophobic
pocket of the protein where tryptophan is located, thus distorting
the structure of the protein.

Figure 6 Thermal denaturation of Lyz with and without
Nos monitored by UV
spectroscopy at 292 nm. The overall melting rate was 0.5 °C min–1. The concentration of Lyz was 15 μM, and concentrations
of Nos used were 15 and 30 μM.

CD Spectroscopy
Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy
has been employed as an informative tool to investigate the folding
of proteins as well as conformational changes in the protein upon
interaction with ligands. Various structural elements (α helix,
β sheets, peptide bonds, etc.) manifested characteristic CD
signatures. CD spectroscopy of Lyz is carried out in phosphate buffer
saline (pH 7.4) at room temperature (298 K). Hen egg protein Lyz has
components of α + β with a larger α domain confining
four α helices along with a comparatively smaller β domain. CD spectra recorded in the
near-UV region (250–300 nm) are very significant in order to
explain the folding of the proteins along with the presence of aromatic
moieties, disulfide bonds, and prosthetic groups in the protein. When
the protein is correctly folded, a prominent signal in the near-UV
region is observed. Near-UV CD spectra significantly give information
about the tertiary structure and environment of protein, whereas far-UV
CD spectra reveal the important characteristic feature of the secondary
structure in proteins.

Figure 7 demonstrates CD spectra of Lyz in the absence as well
as in the presence of Nos. The far-ultraviolet CD spectrum of Lyz
is manifested with two negative minima centered at 208 and 222 nm,
reflecting the characteristic CD signature of an α-helical structure.
It is in good agreement with a previous report.37 Minima at 208 nm correspond to the π–π*
transition of the α helix, whereas minima at 222 nm belong to
the n–π* transitions for both the α
helix and the random coil. On subsequent addition of Nos, the far-UV
CD spectrum of Lyz decreased in intensity with a shift of a 222 nm
peak toward 208 nm, indicating secondary-structure conformational
changes in the protein.38

Figure 7 Circular dichroism spectra
of Lyz (0.7 μM) with various concentrations
of Nos. The curves (1–5) denote 0, 0.7, 1.4, 4.2, and 5.6 μM
Nos in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) at 298 K.

To gain more insight into secondary-structure conformational changes,
the secondary structure is determined by using Yang software and tabulated
in Table 3. The table
clearly shows that native Lyz contains 30.5% α helices, 37%
turns, and 32.5% random coils. On successive addition of Nos, the
content of α helices decreases along with an increase in the
content of β sheets for Lyz. Increasing the concentration of
Nos at 1:1, 1:2, 1:6, and 1:8 manifested a decrease in the α-helix
percentage, that is, 29.2, 24.4, 16, and 3%, respectively, along with
an increment in the β-sheet percentage such as 24.1, 40.6, and
91.6% was observed. Herein, it is a clear indication of conformational
changes occurring on the interaction of Lyz with Nos. It might be
possible that Nos goes inside the hydrophobic pocket of the protein,
binds there, and by doing so, induces conformation alteration/disruption
of the protein’s native conformation.39 The CD experiment is in good correlation with the UV-thermal denaturation
experiment.

Boiled-Egg Permeation Assay of Nos
Pharmacokinetics
and bioavailability gastrointestinal absorption for high efficacy
of the drug were studied using the boiled-egg permeation assay. A
boiled-egg model-based intuitive graphical analysis was performed
for passive absorption of Nos through intestinal and brain penetration.
The result showed that the Nos drug is found to fall inside the white
ellipse, which indicated the high intestinal absorption. Also, Nos
is found to fall very close and partially inside the yellow ellipse
(yolk), which showed that the Nos has high values for permeation in
the blood–brain barrier (BBB) (Figure 8).

Retrieval of the 3D structure
of Lyz and Preparation for Molecular
Docking
Prior to the molecular docking assay, the 3D structure
of Lyz was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2LYZ). Stereochemical
properties were analyzed by the Ramachandran plot using the Saves
server. The Ramachandran plot showed that ∼85% of residues
lie in the most favored region, 15% of residues lie in the additionally
allowed region, and no residue lies in the outlier region. Furthermore,
physicochemical properties of the Lyz structure were evaluated by
the Swiss server, and it showed the QMEAN score to be −1.39
for the structure, representing the overall absolute parameters, including
the torsion angle energy, solvation energy, solvent accessibility,
and atom pairwise energy. These results indicated the stability of
the structure lying in a region close to the white region of the QMEAN
plot. The precision of the structural assessment was determined by
QMEANDisCo scores. It showed the consistent interatomic distances
of the structure, and the local quality plot showed a high-quality
structure by scoring values above 0.6, which was expected for the
high-quality structure according to the QMEANDisCo algorithms (Figure 9).

analysis of Lyz for various parameters (solvation energy and interatomic

Molecular Docking Assay
Molecular docking was performed
to assess the binding of Nos to the Lyz protein. The Lyz protein was
prepared by removing the water molecule to achieve the dry trajectory,
and hydrogen atoms were added to stabilize the protein structure.
HEX 8.0 parameters were set for the shape and conformations to analyze
the binding in the 3D FFT mode with a whole-protein-range angle sampling
method. The grid dimension of 3D Lyz was set to 0.6 Å, and the
protein twist range of 360° and translation steps of 0.8 and
25 outputted the interacting complex system by the steric scan. The resulting top-score docked complex showed a strong interaction
with a binding score of −215.32 kJ mol–1 for
Nos, and it was found to possesses a strong interaction into the binding
groove of the Lyz protein with two hydrogen bonds, one at Arg14 of
a bond length of 2.85 Å with an angle of 147.48° and a second
hydrogen bond at Ile88 of a bond length of 2.97 Å with an angle
of 174.14° as well as strong hydrophobic interactions at Phe50,
Phe51, and Ala160. Arginine14 was also found to form three water bridges
with three different atoms of Nos with a distance of 3.94, 2.71, and
3.85 Å (Figure 10). Notably, Arg14 and His15 residues of Lyz were found
to form the salt bridges with a distance of 4.74 and 5.06 Å.
These molecular interaction dynamics and high binding scores suggested
the potential binding of Nos to the Lyz protein.

of Nos to the binding groove of the Lyz
protein (on the left) and depiction of an enlarged view of involved
molecular interactions (on the right).

Molecular Dynamics Simulation Studies of the Nos–Lyz
Complex
Molecular dynamics analysis of Nos interactions with
the Lyz protein was done for 100 ns-long simulations that were run
using the MDWeb modeling suite. Multiple frames for the complex system
were retrieved for different structural conformations. Resulting trajectory
files of the interacting complex system were taken and analyzed for
RMSD, and they showed a minimal deviation in the Lyz protein in the
range of 0.06 to 0.63 Å. Atomic fluctuation analysis showed the
low atomic fluctuations in the range of 0.3 to 11 Å (Figure 11). These outcomes
suggested the stable interaction of Nos with the Lyz protein with
minimal deviations.

the Nos–Lyz
complex system, showing the minimal deviations. (B) Atomic fluctuation
plot for the Nos–Lyz complex, showing the much fewer atomic
fluctuation deviations and high stability of the interacting complex.

Conclusions
The mechanistic interaction
of Nos and Lyz and their corresponding
conformational changes have been investigated. The emergence of Nos
as a versatile and non-narcotic anticancer drug has encouraged the
studies to decipher its interactions with various model proteins.
Here, in the current report, UV–vis absorption and steady-state
and time-decay fluorescence confirmed the complex formation between
Lyz and Nos, while CD spectra showed the decrease in alpha-helicity
upon binding. Molecular docking and simulations provided a deeper
insight into the phenomenon of binding, while the in silico boiled
egg assay showed good gastrointestinal absorption of the drug. All
these results are complimentary to each other and support the moderate
binding of Nos with Lyz. This study is crucial in developing Nos for
its oncological purposes and helps in understanding its pharmacokinetic
properties.

Materials
Lysozyme (3× crystal, CAS no. 12650-88-3)
was purchased from
Sisco Research Laboratories (SRL), while Nos was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
U.S.A. The chemicals used for all experiments were of analytical grade,
and no further purification was done.

Methods
Sample Preparation
The stock solution of Lyz (25 μM)
was prepared in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, 10 mM, pH 7.4) and diluted
as per the requirement of the experiment. It was stored in a refrigerator
and maintained at a temperature of 2–4 °C. The 10 mM stock
solution of Nos was prepared in DMSO. The volume/volume ratio of DMSO/PBS
was less than 1% in all experiments as it has been reported that,
at this concentration, DMSO does not affect the structure of Lyz.40 All the experiments were performed at 298 K.

UV–Visible Spectroscopy
The UV–visible
spectra were recorded using a Thermo Scientific Evolution 300 UV–vis
spectrophotometer. The concentration of Lyz was kept constant at 15
μM, while the concentration of Nos was increased from 0 to 120
μM in intervals of 15 μM. The spectra were recorded in
the UV range (200–400 nm).

Steady-State Fluorescence
The fluorescence emission
spectra of Lyz in the absence and presence of Nos was recorded using
Horiba PTI QM-8450-11-C. The excitation wavelength was set at 280
nm, and the spectra were recorded between 300 and 550 nm. The excitation
and emission bandwidths were 3 nm.

Inner Filter Effect
The reason for the quenched fluorescence
of the protein can also be attributed to the absorbance of the exciting
light such that a less intense flux is encountered by the sample solution.41 The given equation can be used to correct the
spectra for the inner filter effect.  

Here, Fcorr is the corrected fluorescence intensity of the protein,
while Fobs is the originally observed
intensity. Aex and Aem are the
absorbances of the drug or ligand at the excitation and emission wavelengths
of the protein, respectively.

Time-Resolved Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
The lifetime
decay experiment was performed using a Horiba Yvon lifetime spectrometer.
Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) is the technique employed
by the instrument to measure the decay in lifetime.42 An excitation pulse of 1.2 nm at a 1 MHz pulse repetition
rate was sourced from NanoLED. The spectra were recorded for pure
Lyz and in the presence of varying concentrations of the drug till
a count of 10,000.

UV-Thermal Denaturation
The transition
midpoint (Tm)
of Lyz was monitored by the absorbance at 292 nm as a function of
temperature with a Varian CARY 300 Conc UV spectrophotometer equipped
with a peltier using the software Cary WinUV, thermal.43 A quartz cuvette of 10 mm path length is used
to record the melting of samples. The concentration of Lyz was kept
constant at 15 μM, while Nos is used at concentrations of 15
and 30 μM. The analysis of the melting curves for the measurement
of TM was carried out using the first derivatives.

CD Experiment
CD spectroscopic analysis was carried
out using a J-815 spectrophotometer (JASCO, Japan) at room temperature
using a quartz cuvette of 10 mm path length. Camphorsulfonic acid
was used for CD calibration. Samples were pre-equilibrated at the
desired temperature for 15 min, and the scan speed is fixed at 100
nm min–1 with a response time of 1 s and a 1 nm
bandwidth. To avoid water condensation in the cuvette chamber, it
was flushed with constant purging of a N2 gas. The CD spectra
were collected from 320 to 200 nm at wavelength steps of 1 nm, and
the final reported spectra correspond to the average of three scans.
The scans of the buffer alone were subtracted from the average scans
for each sample for baseline correction. Data were collected in units
of millidegrees and were normalized to total protein concentrations.
Samples were prepared in 10 mM phosphate buffer saline of pH 7.4.
To study the conformational changes of Lyz, a constant concentration
of Lyz (0.7 μM) is titrated with increasing concentrations of
Nos (0.7–5.6 μM).

The molar ellipticity [θ]
is calculated from the observed ellipticity θ as

[θ]
= 100()

These experiments were performed for the  molar ratio in 1:1, 1:2, 1:6, and 1:8.
Secondary structure estimation is done by JASCO software Yang.jwr.

Boiled-Egg Permeation Assay of Nos
For potential drug
development, the drug is required to possess the high values for pharmacokinetics
and bioavailability gastrointestinal absorption for high efficacy
of the drug at different stages. To assess gastrointestinal absorption
and brain penetration, we have performed the intestinal estimated
permeation method (boiled egg) using accurate predictive models. This
method is based on determining the lipophilicity (W log P) and polar nature of the drug (TPSA) from
a large dataset of drugs with reported 93% of accuracy.44,45

Molecular Docking Assay
Molecular docking assay was
performed using the HEX 8.0 molecular docking suite. Hex uses the
fast Fourier transformation algorithm (FTT). Hex outputs the multiple
interacting ligand–protein complexes with the lowest energy
scores; out of these results, a complex system with the lowest energy
value was considered and further studied.46

For docking preparations, the three dimensional (3D) crystal
structure of Lyz was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org). Lyz was prepared
and evaluated to perform molecular dynamics. Stereochemical parameters
of Lyz were assessed through the Ramachandran plot and other in silico
tools.47 The Nos compound was prepared
for docking by drawing using ChemDraw and saving in the required format.
After that, molecular docking parameters were set and docking was
performed, and the resulting complex system (Nos–Lyz) was analyzed
for involved molecular interactions (hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic
bonds), and interacting conformations were analyzed using Chimera
molecular modeling software.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation Studies of
the Nos–Lyz
Complex System
The complex of Nos–Lyz was evaluated
for its stability through the molecular dynamics simulation analysis
using the MDWeb program. The MDWeb suite works by performing the simulations
through the NAMD full molecular dynamics set up to provide the molecular
interaction trajectories.48 Simulation
steps involve the complex-system cleaning, side-chain fixing, solvent
addition, and energy minimization of system. After that, equilibration
of the complex system was done by heating the solvent at 300 K, and
the resulting dry trajectory was evaluated for RMSD and atomic fluctuations
to assess the stability and flexibility of Nos binding to Lyz.
