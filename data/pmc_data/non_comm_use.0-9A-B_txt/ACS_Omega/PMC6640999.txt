Organophosphorus (OP) and triazole
chemicals have been commonly
used as insecticides and fungicides to protect agricultural foods
from harmful insects and fungi. However, these agrichemicals sometimes
remain after distribution and can cause serious health and environmental
issues. Therefore, it is essential to detect OPs and triazole chemicals
in agricultural products. Nowadays, many detection techniques for
OPs and triazole chemicals are expensive and time-consuming and require
highly trained technicians. Thus, particularly rapid, simple, and
sensitive detection methods are in demand for on-site screening of
agrichemicals. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been utilized for applications
in analytical assays and real-time monitoring in the biosensor field
because of their biocompatibility and outstanding size-dependent optical
properties. In this study, we used AuNPs as a detection probe, which
have a size of 17 nm in diameter, a red color, and the absorbance
peak at 520 nm. When imidazole was added to AuNPs mixed with the agrichemicals,
the AuNPs aggregated and their colors changed to purple, causing the
appearance of a new peak at 660–670 nm, which could be measured
within approximately 20 s. Moreover, we developed a novel device for
multiple agrichemical detections using an AuNP-aggregation-based spectrometric
detection system. This portable device is light, simple, fast, and
highly sensitive as well as selective. With this system, agrichemical
residues can be easily detected on the spot at a low cost and in a
short reaction time.

==== Body
Introduction
To protect agricultural
foods from harmful insects and fungi, insecticides
and fungicides composed of organophosphorus (OP) and triazole chemicals
have commonly been used.1−3 However, these agrichemicals sometimes
remain after the foods are distributed, and this can result in serious
health and environmental issues.4−7 When people ingest agrichemical residues from agricultural
products, for example, the residues work as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase,
which is a crucial enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine.8−10 This could eventually lead to serious health problems such as cancer,
neurological disorders, Parkinson’s disease, asthma, and lymphoma.11−13 For this reason, there has been much interest in the detection of
agrichemical residues, and many detection methods have been researched
and developed.

The widely used methods for detecting agrichemicals
are high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC),14,15 gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry,16,17 enzyme inhibition, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay,18,19 and surface-enhanced Raman scattering.20−22 These methods show high sensitivity and selectivity, which enable
the detection of agrichemicals at low concentrations in food, water,
and soil. However, most of them are difficult to handle and time-consuming
and require complicated equipment and expensive reagents. Therefore,
a portable, simple, and rapid detection system for the determination
of agrichemical residues is urgently needed.

Recently, many
detection techniques using the aggregation of nanoparticles
such as iron-oxide, silver, and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been
developed to overcome the disadvantages of the previous methods.23−25 These detection approaches are suitable for on-site detection systems
because nanoparticle aggregation is fast, simple, and easy to confirm
through the color and state of the resultant solution. There are notable
examples to show this simple and fast detection approach trend. Gao
et al. reported a magnetic lateral flow immunochromatographic assay
for detecting residues of paraoxon-methyl by using iron-oxide particle
aggregates.23 Xiong and Li have presented
a colorimetric pesticide detection method.24 Calixarene-modified silver nanoparticles underwent aggregation after
being combined with specific pesticides and changed color. An AuNP-aggregation-based
spectrometric detection system was developed in our group.25 When agrichemicals were added to the AuNP solution
with imidazole, strong aggregation occurred, and the agrichemical
concentrations could be calculated using the absorbance response at
670 nm. However, they reported about the detection of agrichemical
residues on only grains but not fruits and vegetables.

Herein,
we confirmed whether an AuNP-aggregation-based detection
system that was previously developed by our group is also suitable
for fruits, particularly strawberries. Furthermore, we designed a
small and lightweight device with five channels for on-site and multiplex
detection (Scheme 1). Finally, we analyzed the sensitivity and selectivity of the developed
device. Moreover, the reliability of this device was investigated
by comparing its results with HPLC results. The proposed portable
device is a promising candidate for practical application in on-site
trace analysis in food safety, homeland security, and environmental
monitoring.

Chemicals through

Results and Discussion
AuNP-Based Agrichemical Detection System
The key to
the detection system using AuNPs is their aggregation. The fact that
the aggregation of AuNPs is strongly induced by imidazole and agrichemical
complexes rather than only imidazole was shown in previous research.

As shown in Figure 1A, the absorbance peak of AuNPs was observed at 520 nm, whereas the
peaks of the other chemicals, imidazole and tebuconazole, were not.
In addition, when AuNPs were added to the germicide solution, only
the absorbance peak of AuNPs appeared. When an AuNP solution was added
to the imidazole solution, weak aggregation of the AuNPs was observed.
As a result, a broad absorbance peak appeared between 600 and 700
nm. However, when the 1 ppm tebuconazole solution was added to the
above-mentioned solution, a strong aggregation of AuNPs occurred and
a sharp absorbance peak appeared at 670 nm. Figure 1C–E depicts the treatment of AuNP
solutions with different substances. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was employed to verify the aggregation of the AuNPs. Weak aggregation
was observed after the addition of the imidazole solution (Figure 1D); however, with
1 ppm tebuconazole, the AuNPs showed more aggregation (Figure 1E).

Figure 1 Optical response of the
assay. (A) UV–vis spectra of the
AuNP solutions revealed that a color change occurs in the presence
of imidazole (0.3 mM) and tebuconazole (1.0 ppm) with imidazole. (B)
Change in absorbance with increasing tebuconazole concentration (0,
0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.0 ppm). TEM images of AuNPs (C),
imidazole–AuNPs (D), and tebuconazole-treated imidazole–AuNPs
(E).

The AuNP-based optical sensor
was used to detect tebuconazole using
the developed portable device, and the ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis spectra) at 670 nm of the AuNPs were measured at different
tebuconazole concentrations ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 ppm (0, 0.05,
0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.0 ppm) (Figure 1B). As the AuNPs form longer chains with
increasing tebuconazole concentration, the absorption peak at 520
nm remained and the absorbance intensity at 670 nm increased.26

We also investigated the sensitivity
of the optical sensing platform
using three different harmful agrichemicals, edifenphos, iprobenfos,
and diazinon, using the same experimental procedures as those used
for tebuconazole. Figure S1A,B shows the
changes in the absorbance peak at 600 to 700 nm with various diazinon
and edifenphos concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and
1.0). Figure S1C shows that the absorbance
response at 680 nm increased when the iprobenfos concentration increased
from 0 to 0.7 ppm. The absorbance responses of iprobenfos, edifenphos,
and diazinon were saturated when their concentrations were higher
than 1 ppm. An iprobenfos concentration higher than 0.7 ppm also led
to saturation in the absorbance graph. This result suggests that this
system allows both the quantitative and qualitative analyses of agrichemicals.

Design of Portable Device for Fast and Simple Detection
So far, we have demonstrated a simple and fast system for agrichemical
detection. On the basis of this system, we designed a portable device
with a five-channel system for spontaneous analysis and with enhanced
portability for easy real-field analysis by decreasing the size of
the device. Because a clear spectrum of the aggregated AuNPs can be
obtained with a darker detecting chamber, the device was developed
to be light-tight. The display was a 7 in. touch screen, and the sample
holder can be manipulated with a button for automatic loading–unloading.
Moreover, to improve the performance of the device and for smooth
sample movement, the sample-holder system employed a linear motion
guide rail. An ESD200 Bluetooth module from Chipsen was introduced;
this could enable wireless telecommunication with devices containing
a universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter interface within a range
of 30 m. For the liquid sample measurement, we designed a spectroscopic
optical system using a white LED (450–750 nm) as a light source
and a charge-coupled device detector (0.5–2.0 Abs). Using the
existing spectroscopic equipment (Synergy H1), the linearized standard
curve at 670 nm wavelength was obtained for Tebuconazole. After that,
linear equation was incorporated into the developed device for further
experimental analysis. Therefore, when the tebuconazole sample was
put into the device, the absorbance intensity at 670 nm was measured.
Finally, this intensity value was converted to agrichemical concentration
from the standard curve equation, and then the value (in ppm) was
displayed on the screen. Figure 2 shows the recently developed spectrophotometer system.
The development of optical instrument was used for all experiments.

Figure 2 Diagram
of the designed device for analysis of absorbance at a
particular wavelength.

Detection of Agrichemicals
The sensitivity of the convenient
developed instrument was examined to determine the limit of detection
(LOD) for tebuconazole. Figure 3A shows the absorbance spectrum plot at 670 nm of the imidazole–AuNP
system treated with tebuconazole at various concentrations. The absorbance
response at 670 nm increased as the tebuconazole concentration increased
because of the aggregation of AuNPs. Dynamic light scattering (DLS)
measurements were performed to verify the aggregation of AuNPs (Figure 3B). The graph shows
that the diameter of the AuNP aggregation increased from 415.9 ±
7.7 to 548.8 ± 8.4 nm as the concentration of tebuconazole increased
from 0.0 to 1.0 ppm.

Figure 3 (A) Plot of absorbance at 670 nm (A670) versus tebuconazole concentration. The absorbance values
were measured
using the device developed in this study. The standard deviations
(SDs) of the measurements were calculated from the results of three
independent experiments. The inset table shows the trend line and
the correlation coefficient of the plot. (B) Size analysis of aggregated
AuNPs at different concentrations of tebuconazole: 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3,
0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 ppm.

A linear relationship between the tebuconazole concentration
and
the absorbance at 670 nm was observed as the tebuconazole concentration
(0.0–1.0 ppm) increased, with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9910 (inset table in Figure 3A). The LOD for tebuconazole
using this assay was 52.0 ppb according to a 3σ calculation.
Additionally, other agrichemicals, namely edifenphos, iprobenfos,
and diazinon, were also examined using the procedure described above
(Figure S3). The results indicated that
these samples showed similar limits of detection (∼50 ppb)
and high linearity and linear regression correlation values. These
results satisfy the acceptable limits for agricultural residues presented
in the regulations of local governments and the Ministry of Food and
Drug Safety in the Republic of Korea for agrichemical concentration.
On the basis of these experimental results, the device has the potential
to be adopted in real-field analysis owing to its high sensitivity,
rapidity, and portability.

Comparison of the Proposed Assay with HPLC
The reliability
of the developed device was determined by comparing its results with
the calculated values obtained using HPLC, which is one of the sensitive
agrichemical detection methods. The present method was used to quantify
the tebuconazole concentrations, as shown in Table 1. To demonstrate the accuracy of the developed
portable device, HPLC was used to assay several tebuconazole samples.

a The SDs of the measurements are
calculated from three independent experiments.

The results from the developed instrument
were generally more accurate
than those obtained using HPLC at various tebuconazole concentrations.
Also, it was confirmed that the developed instrument was accurate
for the detection of diazinon, iprobenfos, and edifenphos at various
concentrations (Tables S1–S3). Table 1 shows that the developed
instrument is more rapid, portable, accurate, and convenient. The
results are in good agreement with those from the established instrument.
The recoveries of tebuconazole in the samples were between 98.7 and
100.5%. The results indicated that the developed instrument is accurate.

Selectivity in Detection
To evaluate the selectivity
of the optical sensor in detecting agrichemicals, various chemicals
with structures similar to those of the agrichemical samples, namely,
10% methanol, phosphoric acid, phenol, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, toluene,
and xylene, were analyzed. After 1 ppm of the above-mentioned substances
was added to the AuNP–imidazole solution, the interferences
were tested under the same conditions as those used for the agrichemicals.
As shown in Figure 4, no distinct changes in the absorbance peak at 670 nm were observed
as each of these interferences was added when compared with the peaks
from the agrichemical results. These results clearly indicate that
this strategy using the developed device can be used to detect agrichemicals
with high selectivity.

other
compounds. All chemicals were tested at concentrations of 1.0 ppm.

Conclusions
In
this study, we developed a simple sensor for the detection of
OP and triazole agrichemicals based on the aggregation of AuNPs. The
agrichemicals were successfully detected in strawberries using the
developed device. The limits of detection calculated for this device
were 52, 54, 48, and 45 ppb for tebuconazole, iprobenfos, diazinon,
and edifenphos, respectively. These results show that this portable,
simple, rapid, and cost-effective device has good sensitivity and
selectivity. Moreover, it has a wireless data-transfer function and
a central monitoring program. We are convinced that this system based
on bioinformation fusion technology can be used in farms, markets,
and homes and will contribute to the enhancement of human health.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Reagents
Gold(III) chloride trihydrate
(HAuCl4·3H2O), iprobenfos, edifenphos,
diazinon, and tebuconazole were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Sodium sulfate anhydrous was manufactured by Jin Chemical (Bucheon,
Korea). Imidazole and trisodium citrate dihydrate were purchased from
Bio-Basic (Ontario, Canada). Methanol was purchased from Merck Chemicals
(Darmstadt, Germany).

Synthesis of Citrate-Stabilized AuNPs
To an Erlenmeyer
flask on a stirring hot plate with a magnetic stir bar, 100 mL of
1.0 mM HAuCl4 was added, and the solution was brought to
a rolling boil at 85 °C. Then, 10 mL of 38.8 mM trisodium citrate
dihydrate was quickly added to the rapidly stirred boiling solution.
After a 12 min reaction, the desired gold solution gradually formed
as the citrate reduced the gold(III) ions and the color changed to
dark purple and then vivid red. The solution was cooled rapidly in
an ice bath and stored at 4 °C.

Preparation of Agrichemical
Samples
Ten grams of Strawberries
with the leaves removed was soaked for 2 min in a 99% methanol solution
(strawberry-to-methanol ratio = 1 g:1 mL). Filtration was performed
using a 0.45 μm filter to remove the residue from the strawberries.
Na2SO4 powder (0.3 g) was added, and the filtrate
was shaken for 3 min to remove the moisture. The Na2SO4 powder sank, and the extraction solution was diluted with
10% (v/v) methanol in deionized water. To obtain a 1000 ppm solution,
10 μg of agrichemical residue was added to 10 mL of the diluted
solution. The above solution was further diluted using 10% (v/v) methanol
to obtain suitable concentrations. To analyze a real sample, agrichemical
residue solutions of various concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,
0.7, and 1.0 ppm) were prepared by dissolving 10 μg of agrichemical
residue in 10 mL of the strawberry extract solution. For the imidazole
solution, 0.3 mM imidazole was added to 50 mL of phosphate-buffered
saline (50 mM, pH 7.4) solution.

Determination of the Chemicals
In a cuvette, 350 μL
of a 9 nM AuNP solution was added to 700 μL of agrichemical
residue solution and 350 μL of 0.3 mM imidazole solution (AuNP/agrichemical
residue/imidazole solution ratio = 1:2:1). UV–vis spectroscopy
was conducted at 670 nm using the developed instrument after the above
solution had reacted for 20 s. The standard agrichemical residues
were dissolved in methanol after dilution, and the solutions were
filtered using a 0.2 μm syringe filter. The OP chemicals were
quantified using HPLC (Agilent 1260, Santa Clara, CA) using a C 18
column (10 cm length and an inner diameter of 4.6 mm, Eclipse Plus,
Agilent). The agrichemical residues were analyzed at 35 °C and
monitored using the UV absorbance at 250 nm. The agrichemical residue
solution was chromatographed with a premixed mobile phase composed
of 65:35 (v/v) methanol/water at room temperature. The samples of
100 μL were injected at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.

Characterization
TEM images were obtained using a Tecnai
G2 F30 S-Twin (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) microscope at an operating acceleration
voltage of 300 kV. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded
using a Synergy H1 (BioTek, Winooski, VT) instrument. DLS measurements
were completed on a particle size analyzer ELSZ-1000 system (Photal
OTSUKA Electronics, Tokyo, Japan) Agrichemical detections were performed
with the developed device (WellKeeper) (Well Korea, Daejeon, Korea)
within 90 s.
