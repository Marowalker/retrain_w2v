Mixed
fatty acid-modified aggregators have been developed as potential
crude oil sorbents. Cheap pine wood flour was first modified with
oleic acid (OA) and further modified with a second fatty acid by a
leaving group chemistry, where a surface hydroxyl group is first replaced
by p-toluenesulfonyl group and a fatty acid forms
a covalent bond on sawdust surface through esterification at the elevated
temperature (55 °C). Two OA-modified base materials, pine/OA-106
and pine/OA-124, with different OA-coverages were first prepared and
the second fatty acids with C3, C6, C8, C10, C12, C14, or C16 alkyl
chains were applied to cover the remaining surface hydroxyl groups.
The crude oil sorption capacities of the mixed fatty acid-modified
aggregators were studied and compared with those of the base materials.
The results showed that mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators increased
up to 45.6% more crude oil sorption than those of OA-modified base
materials. A correlation between surface property and sorption capacity
was studied by moisture sorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
X-ray diffraction, 13C cross polarization and magic angle
spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, thermal gravimetric analysis,
and scanning electron microscopy. To our knowledge, no report has
been published for mixed fatty acid-modified herders or aggregators
in the environmental remediation.

==== Body
Introduction
Crude oil is one of
the most important energy sources for synthetic
polymers and chemicals worldwide. However, when this vital resource
is accidentally released, it causes significant environmental and
ecological problems.1 From 2007 to 2016,
an average of nine spills greater than 50 barrels was reported,2 and 31% of them were crude oil spills. Effective
decontamination and cleanups are necessary for the protection of the
environment and human health.3 Although
there are currently many cleanup technologies, such as in situ burning
and the use of chemical dispersants and sorbents (such as booms and
skimmers), an important technology to mitigate crude oil spills in
the Arctic is to apply a chemical herding agent, such as the US Navy
(USN) cold water herder formulation (65% sorbitan monolaurate [Span-20]
and 35% 2-ethyl butanol) that corrals the oil by reducing the interfacial
tension between oil droplets and by pushing inward from the periphery
of the spill.4 The USN herding agents work
most effectively when they are applied to undisturbed thin layers
of oil slicks (<3 mm) for few hours, and therefore, have limitations
when used under realistic marine conditions. The objective is to create
an oil slick thickness, >3 mm, which is the minimum thickness that
allows the oil to be ignited and burned off. However, chemical herding
agents suffer from several limitations, for example, they work best
under calm sea conditions, low wind velocity, no ice, and have a limited
effectiveness of about an hour upon deployment. Furthermore, the herding
agents themselves may be toxic. Effective sorbents for a crude oil
spill cleanup should have important characteristics such as oleophilicity,
hydrophobicity, oil retention capacity, and biodegradability. Crude
oil sorbents can be classified into three basic categories, including
inorganic mineral products, organic synthetic products, and organic
vegetable products since sorption techniques are one of the most effective
approaches for the treatment of crude oil spills.5,6 Inorganic
sorbents include zeolites, silica, perlite, graphite, vermiculites,
sorbent clay, diatomite, glass, wool, sand, and volcanic ash. Materials
such as polypropylene and polyurethane are organic synthetic products.
Natural organic sorbents include peat moss, wood fiber, cotton fiber,
cellulosic kapok fiber, kenaf, milkweed floss straw, hay, sawdust,
ground corncobs, feathers, and other carbon-based products.4,7 However, these sorbent materials also showed limitations especially
in the presence of waves and wind. The main drawbacks of plant-derived
sorbents are their relatively low oil sorption capacity, low hydrophobicity,
and poor buoyancy compared to synthetic sorbents, such as polypropylene.8 Considerable efforts have recently been devoted
to the development of superhydrophobic herding materials including
3D aerogel of MOF/r-GO9,10 and hydrophobic coating on fabrics.11,12 Once plant-derived sorbents are applied to saturated environments,
preferential water sorption is favored over the sorption of crude
oil because the sorbents are typically hydrophilic in nature. Agricultural
byproducts have well-documented problems with water sorption and a
lack of dimensional stability due to their associated hydroxyl functionalities.
These groups are abundantly available in all three major chemical
components of plant-based materials and are responsible for their
hydrophilicity.13 Hydrophobicity (oleophilicity)
is one of the major advantages of sorbent properties that influence
the effectiveness of oil sorption in the presence of water. The effectiveness
of the sorbents in saturated environments would be enhanced when the
density of the hydroxyl functionalities is decreased.14 The hydroxyl functionality of these fibers can be reduced
by chemical modification, such as acetylation, acylation, and alkylation.15 To overcome the limitations of available herding
agents and sorbents, a next generation material is being sought by
agencies charged with planning and overseeing spill response.

We have developed scalable sawdust-based prototype materials with
desirable properties: buoyant in sea water, aggregates and maintains
a thick oil slick, and supports multiple cleanup strategies: burning,
skimming, or bioremediation.16 We have
identified that a novel class of material dubbed an “aggregator”
that combines the above properties with adsorbent behavior. It consists
of finely milled wood flour (a cheap byproduct of sawmills) modified
with a fatty acid, OA.

In this study, extra hydroxyl groups
on the OA-modified pine sawdust
are modified with the second fatty acid with different alkyl chain
lengths to have very hydrophobic character (Figure 1). The structural, chemical, thermal properties,
and crude oil capacities of the mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators
were systematically evaluated. These aggregators exhibited enhanced
sorption capacities relative to unmodified or oleic acid-modified
aggregators for crude oil.

Results
and Discussion
Pine wood flour (40–60 mesh) was selected
for our work based
on our previous work. It showed better exfoliation of cellulose networks
than larger pine wood particles (10–20 mesh) or hardwood (maple)
so that more OA molecules were infiltrated and reacted on the surface.6 Two base materials (pine/OA-106 and pine/OA-124),
where 106 and 124 means weight percent gain (WPG) of OA in pine wood
particles, were synthesized in different lengths of reaction time
at 55 °C. We also prepared highly OA-modified pine sample (>160%),
but it showed very small amount of surface coverage (<15%) with
second fatty acids. Therefore, we chose two OA-modified aggregators
as base materials, and their properties are summarized in Table 1. The base materials
were further modified with C3, C6, C8, C10, C12, C14, C16, or C18
at 55 °C for 8 h. Figure 2a WPG of mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators with second
fatty acids. When fatty acids with relatively short alkyl chains (C3,
C6, and C8) were applied, their WPG of mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators
were very low (0–2.0 wt %). The less hydrophobic character
of the shorter alkyl chains was not enough to penetrate into OA surface
layers on both pine/OA base materials. However, fatty acids with C10–C14
significantly contributed to WPG of both pine/OA-106 and pine/OA-124.
Mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators with C16 fatty acid did not
show much enhancement of WPG of both base materials, where large alkyl
chains might be too bulky to penetrate into OA layers. The hydrophobic
character of mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators was confirmed by
a moisture sorption test in K2CO3 at 20 °C,
where its relative humidity is 43.2 ± 0.4% (Figure 2b). Unmodified pine sawdust
usually sorbs 3–3.5% moisture, and OA modification decreases
moisture content down to 0.65–1.10 wt %, depending on the surface
coverage. The further modification of the base materials with the
second fatty acids significantly decreased their moisture sorption
down to ≤0.1 wt %. This result was confirmed by our contact
angle measurement. The contact angle of the unmodified pine sawdust
was 106.0°. However, the substantial enhancement of the hydrophobic
character of the surface of the OA- and mixed fatty acid-modified
aggregators was clearly proven by increase in θ with the polar
water: 133.07 (pine/OA-106), 133.78 (pine/OA-124), 134.69 (pine/OA-106-C10),
139.51 (pine/OA-106-C12), 136.98 (pine/OA-124-C10), and 135.06 (pine/OA-124-C12)
(see Supporting Information Figure S1).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of unmodified,
OA-modified, and
mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators were collected, as shown in Figure 3. The main diffraction
peaks of unmodified pine sawdust show a typical cellulose I crystalline
structure at 2θ = 15.0, 16.2, 22.3, and 35.0, which are assigned
to the diffraction planes of 101, 10i̅, 002, and 040, respectively.
Peaks with significantly reduced intensity (or complete disappearance)
in three diffraction planes, 101, 10i̅, and 040, were observed
in the pattern of the modified aggregators, which indicated that the
structure of the cellulose was transformed to an amorphous structure
after modification. (002) peak was maintained, but it showed a progressive
broadening and exfoliation upon addition of the second fatty acid
(Figure 3c). A d-spacing of unmodified pine sawdust used in this study
was 3.98 Å. It was significantly increased (4.23 Å) when
modified with OA. When further modified with second fatty acids, it
increased up to 4.58 Å in pine/OA-124-C12, indicating that the
substitution of hydroxyl groups by OA and second fatty acids breaks
inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds of cellulose and decreases
the degree of crystallinity. The crystallinity index determined in
this study was 51.16% for the unmodified sawdust, 6.61% for OA-modified
aggregators, and undetectable (0%) for the mixed fatty acid-modified
aggregators. A major portion of cellulose is in a crystalline form
due to intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding of hydroxyl groups.
However, modification of the cellulose material often results in a
decrease in crystallinity.17,18 The substitution of
an alkyl group for a hydroxyl group reduces the density of hydrogen
bonding because an alkyl group offers a more bulky branch (i.e., a
decreased ability to form hydrogen bonding) than a hydroxyl group.19 Therefore, the fatty acid-modified aggregators
will possess more desirable properties for crude oil sorption in an
aqueous environment.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of unmodified,
OA-modified,
and mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators give direct support of the
occurrence of esterification by shifting and enhancement of carbonyl
(C=O) peak at 1734 cm–1 to higher wavenumber
at 1747–1759 cm–1 after the modification
reaction and an increase in the intensity of the C–H band at
2850–2950 cm–1 arising from the aliphatic
acid chain (Figure 4), which was observed that the single band in the unmodified pine
sawdust was changed to double absorptive bands in all modified aggregators.
The decrease in the intensity of the broad band around 3400 cm–1, assigned to the cellulose O–H vibration,
is additional proof of the successful esterification of sawdust powders.
The minimal intensity of O–H vibration peaks of mixed fatty
acid-modified aggregators with C10 or C12 was observed.

A typical example of 13C cross-polarization magic angle
spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS NMR) spectrum of unmodified
sawdust is shown in Figure 5.20 The peaks are not well resolved
due to the composite of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The
resonance at 172.98 ppm indicates carbonyl groups in lignin.21,22 The peaks of fatty acids were assigned according to the literature
and previous records.23,24 In the pine/OA base materials,
a new resonance at 129.5 ppm is associated with unsaturated carbons
of OA. The peak shifting (to 171.95 ppm) and increasing intensity
in the carbonyl region was observed with OA- and mixed fatty acid
modification due to esterification with fatty acids. Appearance of
new resonances in the spectra of modified aggregators, typical of
aliphatic hydrocarbons (14–40 ppm), gave additional evidence
of the occurrence of the esterification reaction. The total relative
intensity of these peaks is well correlated to the WPG of mixed fatty
acid-modified aggregators (Figure 2a), as illustrated in Figure 5b,d, even though it is only suggestive.25 The direct comparison of relative area of crystalline
and amorphous C4 (cellulose) peaks around 88 and 84 ppm for all spectra
was not possible due to the modification of sawdust, rather than pure
cellulose fibers.26

NMR spectra of unmodified, OA-modified,
and mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators: (a, b) pine/OA-106, (c,
d) pine/OA-124.

Thermal gravimetric (TG)
measurements were performed to evaluate
the thermal properties of mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators by
comparing the temperatures of the first derivative of the weight-loss
curves. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and DTG (first differential
TG) curves of all of the aggregators including unmodified pine sawdust
are shown in Figure 6. The data of weight loss at 150 °C, initial decomposition temperature Tdi, and decomposition
temperature at maximum degradation rates, Td1 and Td2, for
two sets of mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators are shown Tables S1 and S2 (see Supporting Information).
The unmodified pine sawdust shows a single weight-loss step with a
maximum at about 328 °C, where the decompositions of hemicellulose
and cellulose were not separated in a 10 °C/min heating rate.
The broad peak between 350 and 550 °C in DTG of unmodified sawdust
is attributed to the decomposition of lignin. It was observed that
mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators showed very similar thermal
stability to those of OA-modified base materials due to their similar
molecular structures, where the modification of sawdust with mixed
fatty acids dramatically changed the thermal stability. Mixed fatty
acid-modified aggregators started to decompose at temperatures (∼160
°C), which were substantially lower than that of unmodified sawdust
(>208 °C), and mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators with
C10–C14 showed the lowest thermal stability, as seen from changes
in Tdi in Tables S1 and S2. This behavior is attributed
to the further decrease in crystallinity associated with substitution
of cellulose hydroxyls with second fatty acids. The thermograms of
mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators showed two main separate degradation
steps, with maximum degradation temperatures around 220 °C (Td1) and 270 °C (Td2), where Td1 was assigned to the cellulose fraction the aggregators and Td2 was attributed to the fatty acid
fraction. It was also observed that the weight loss in initial temperature
(150 °C) decreased with the second fatty acid substitution. This
is attributed to less moisture content for the aggregators with the
second fatty acid substitution. The second C10 and C12 substitution
of pine/OA-106 and pine/OA-124 showed least moisture content, which
is consistent with the moisture sorption data discussed earlier.

Scanning electron microscopic
(SEM) images have been taken to investigate
morphological changes of mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators after
the second modification of OA-modified base materials. Figure 7 shows the cell structures
parallel to the longitudinal directions of the surface of unmodified,
OA-modified, and mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators. It was observed
that the main structure was maintained, but individual cellulose fibers
were separated after OA modification and even more separated after
mixed fatty acid modification. This indicates that each individual
cellulose fiber is exfoliated by infiltration of fatty acids into
the cellular network in pyridine.

and (g) pine/OA-124-C12. A scale bar in images indicates 100 μm.

Figure 8a shows
sorption capacity of mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators including
OA-modified base materials. A modified sorption technique has been
used to measure maximum crude oil sorption capacity because it is
not easy to test crude oil-sorbed aggregators in sea water.6 Unmodified pine sawdust showed a high capacity
of about 4.0 g crude oil per g pine sawdust. However, it showed ≤2.0
g of crude oil sorption in the presence of sea water but also minimal
buoyancy retention in wavy sea water. Oil sorption capacity of mixed
fatty acid-modified aggregators was proportional to alkyl chain length
of second fatty acids and showed maximum sorption capacities when
the base aggregators were further modified with C12. The maximum capacity,
6.42 g/g, is 45.6% enhanced capacity relative to that of the base
aggregator (pine/OA-106). Aggregators modified with longer alkyl chains
(C14 and C16) showed decreased capacities. This crude oil sorption
pattern is very consistent with moisture sorption, XRD, FT-IR, TGA
data. When the best aggregator, pine/OA-106-C12, was recycled through
multiple cycles (washed crude oil with dichloromethane and vacuum-dried),
it showed pretty consistent sorption toward crude oil with 2.0–5.1%
deviation (Figure 8b).

Conclusions
A cheap byproduct of
sawmills, pine sawdust, has been modified
with mixed fatty acids and deployed as a sorbent for crude oil spill
treatment. The mixed fatty acid-modified aggregators showed highly
hydrophobic, oleophilic, and excellent buoyancy in sea water, and
their sorption capacities were substantially enhanced relative to
those of OA-modified aggregators. Systematic characterization of mixed
fatty acid-modified aggregators with moisture sorption, transformation
of crystalline structure into amorphous structure and exfoliation
of cellulose d-spacing (XRD), an increase of carbonyl
and alkyl group, and a decrease of hydroxyl group (FT-IR, 13C CP/MAS NMR), and an initial decomposition and initial weight loss
(TGA) is well aligned with final crude oil sorption data. These easy
and inexpensive preparation, excellent buoyancy, biodegradability,
and low water retention make the aggregators a very promising alternative
for crude oil spill treatment.

Methods
Chemicals
and Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) and used without further purification. Pine sawdust
materials (40–60 mesh; 250–400 μm) were purchased
from Marth Wood Shaving Supply Inc. (Marathon, WI). Before the reaction,
all sawdust samples were vacuum-dried at 60 °C for 2–3
days to prevent the contamination of pyridine with water and the aggregation
of the leaving group (p-toluenesulfonyl (p-Ts)) on sawdust samples.

Preparation
of Mixed Fatty Acid-Modified Aggregators
Prior to the esterification
reaction of sawdust with oleic acid, 3.48 g of p-TsCl
was dissolved in 30 mL of pyridine, then 1.0 g of sawdust was added.
The reaction flask was placed in a silicon oil bath (55–58
°C), and 5.0 g of oleic acid was slowly added to the mixture
with vigorous stirring for 6, 8, or 10 h. Once reaction was completed,
the newly synthesized aggregator was cooled, filtered, and ethanol-washed,
followed by the Soxhlet extraction with ethanol. The final product
was vacuum-dried at 60 °C overnight and ready for further modification
with different fatty acids. The two base materials (pine/OA-106 and
pine/OA-124) are further modified with C3, C6, C8, C10, C12, C14,
C16, and C18 fatty acids using the same process (55 °C for 8
h).

Characterization
Synthesized aggregators were weighed
to determine the WPG, [(weight
gain/original weight) × 100]. After storing dry samples in saturated
aqueous K2CO3 solution (43.2 ± 0.4 relative
humidity (RH) at 20 °C) overnight, moisture sorption values were
obtained. Formulation to calculate moisture sorption (%) was [increased
weight/dry sample weight] × 100. XRD patterns of unmodified and
modified aggregators were obtained by a desktop X-ray diffractometer
(Rigaku, The Woodlands, TX) using Cu Kα (1.54059 Å) radiation
with the X-ray generator operating at 20 kV and 30 mA. Data were collected
for a 2θ range of 5.0–40.0° at an angular resolution
of 0.01°/s. The crystallinity index (Ic) was determined using eq 1 1  where I(002) is
the counter reading for the peak intensity at a 2θ angle close
to 22° and I(am) is the amorphous
counter reading at a 2θ angle at approximately 18°. FT-IR
spectra were recorded over a range from 400–4000 cm–1 with a resolution of 2.0 cm–1, using a Thermo
Nicolet Nexus 670 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA). 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra for a series of aggregators
were performed at 11.4 T using a 600 MHz solid-state NMR spectrometer
(Agilent) equipped with a 4 mm HFXY MAS probe. All 13C
CP/MAS NMR spectra were obtained using a vender-supplied sequence
(tancpx in VNMRJ, Agilent) with a 3 s recycle delay and 2 ms contact
time at a 15 kHz spinning rate and at ambient temperature (∼25
°C). The 1H NMR 90° pulse length was 5 μs.
The 13C NMR chemical shift was externally calibrated with
hexamethylbenzene (HMB) of 17.3 ppm relative to tetramethylsilane
of 0 ppm. TGA was carried out by a NETZSCH STA 449 F1 analyzer equipped
with an alumina cell. Samples were heated at a constant rate of 10
°C/min from 25.0 up to 700 °C, with an air flow of 50 mL/min
and nitrogen (protecting gas) flow of 15 mL/min. The initial thermal
decomposition temperature (Tdi) was recorded when sample heating resulted in weight
loss (≤0.5%). Materials were prepared for contact angle measurements
by first affixing Scotch double-sided tape to a microscope slide and
then pouring the sample material in excess on the tape. Material was
then brushed with a gloved finger to remove any nonbound material.
This slide was then placed on the stage of a ramé-hart 590-U1
automated goniometer. The goniometer was operated using DROPimage
Advanced v2.7.03 software to apply a 15 μL drop of 18 MΩ
purified water to the sample surface. The drop was imaged with backlighting
(adjusted to reduce impact of sample surface roughness) using a Basler
GenICam. Each sample’s contact angle was determined as an average
of 6 distinct 15 μL drops, with each drop being measured 40
times (8 measurements; 5 frames averaged per measurement). Sample
imaging was performed using an AmScope MU1000 10 MP camera fixed to
an AmScope T340B-LED trinocular compound microscope. The microscope
stage at 10× magnification was calibrated using a NIST-certified
micrometer, and sample images obtained using the AmScope v3.7.5849
software.

Sorption
Test of Crude Oil
The American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) methods for oil sorption capacity measurements (F716-09 and
F726-12) were considered suitable for testing the wood flour aggregators27 because the product stuck to the test vessel
once it was coated with the added crude oil, leading inconsistencies
in mass measurement. The sorption capacity of aggregator samples was
tested with crude oil (West Texas Intermediate). Aggregator was weighed
(∼100 mg) and placed in the middle of a 50 mm Petri dish. Using
a micropipette, crude oil was gradually added to the aggregator until
it was saturated then weighed. The amount of oil that was sorbed by
aggregator was assessed, and sorbed oil (g)/aggregator (g) values
were calculated. Sorption measurements of crude oil were carried out
in triplicate for each type of aggregator to get average and standard
deviation values.
