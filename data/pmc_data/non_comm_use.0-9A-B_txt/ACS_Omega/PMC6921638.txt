A method for green synthesis of sulfur, nitrogen co-doped
photoluminescence
carbon dots (S,N/CDs) originating from two natural biomass was proposed.
By simple hydrothermal heating of bean pod and onion, blue emission
CDs were prepared. Ag+ can effectively quench the as-prepared
S,N/CDs. Under optimized conditions, the linear range of the established
method for Ag+ detection was 0.1–25 μM, and
the detection of limit based on 3S/N was 37 nM. More interestingly,
the addition of Ag+ can induce an evident color change
of S,N/CDs from yellow to brown under sunlight. The developed method
was applied for detection of Ag+ in river water and tap
water samples. Satisfied recoveries ranging from 96.0 to 102.0% with
precision below 4.1% were obtained. S,N/CDs showed low toxicity toward
4T1 cells, which also can be extended to cellular imaging and intracellular
Ag+ detection. The simple and green approach proposed here
could meet the requirements for bioimaging and environmental monitoring.

Introduction
Carbon dots (CDs) are widely applied in
chemical sensors and bioimaging
due to their low cost, low toxicity, easy surface modification, chemical
inertness, and excellent biocompatibility.1−5 CDs can be prepared by top-down approaches (laser
ablation approach,6 electrochemical approach7) and bottom-up approaches (thermal pyrolysis,8 hydrothermal method,9 solvothermal treatment,10 microwave heating
method,11,12 and metal–organic framework (MOF)
template-based approach13). More recently,
hydrothermal treatment has become the most commonly used method because
of low cost and nontoxic routes. By regulating the precursor and doping
elements, the emission light of CDs can be regulated from blue14,15 to yellow16 to green17 to red,18−21 or even dual emission CDs22−25 can be designed. Generally, element doping can increase
the quantum yield (QY).26−30 Usually, doping of N atom into CDs could increase their stability
and fluorescence quantum yield.31 Sulfur
doping not only enhances fluorescence intensity but also causes red
shift in the maximum absorption wavelength.32 Using natural biomass, such as chestnut,33 papaya,34 pineapple peel,35 potatos,36 corn bract,37 and Tamarindus indica leaves,37 as precursor to prepare doping
CDs was interesting.

Ag+ is widely used in medical,
skin care, and pharmaceutical
and electrical fields. However, excessive Ag+ is considered
as a toxic heavy metal ion for human beings and the environment.38,39 In recent years, CDs play an important role for Ag+ detection
in water environment monitoring and cell imaging, due to their facile
operation, superior biocompatibility, excellent selective and low
detection limits.3,4,40 Ag+ induced fluorescence quenching of CDs is common through static
quenching,4 the inner filter effect,10 chelation,41 and
electron transfer.42 Based on the quenching
process of CDs by Ag+, many bifunctional sensing systems
were developed.2,3,40,41 Therefore, it is still significant to develop
an environmentally friendly and cost-effective fluorescent sensor
for Ag+ detection to cope with complicated real water and
biological samples.

Considering that bean pods are rich in nitrogen
elements and onions
are rich in thiol compounds, an economical green method for S,N co-doped
CDs (S,N/CDs) was reported by the hydrothermal treatment of bean pod
and onion in aqueous solution. The as-prepared S,N/CDs exhibited good
water dispersity and strong blue photoluminescence. Furthermore, the
addition of Ag+ can induce effective quenching of S,N/CDs.
The quenching mechanism was discussed in detail using fluorescent
lifetime, UV–vis absorption spectra, and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images. The quenching mechanism may be ascribed to
aggregation induced quenching. More interestingly, the addition of
Ag+ can induce an evident color change of S,N/CDs from
yellow to brown under sunlight, and colorimetric detection of silver
ions was feasible. S,N/CDs were successfully employed to sensitively
and selectively detect Ag+ in drinking water samples. S,N/CDs
showed low toxicity toward the 4T1 cells; the probe also can be extended
to cellular imaging and intracellular Ag+ detection, as
illustrated in Scheme 1. The novelty of this work is reflected in the following aspects.
First, S and N elements co-doped CDs were prepared using green raw
materials, which was simple and environmentally friendly. Second,
the detection of silver ions can be achieved by colorimetric and fluorescent
dual modes. The detection process was convenient and fast. Third,
S,N/CDs have superior biocompatibility and display high sensitivity
for silver ion detection in living cells.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization of S,N/CDs
S,N/CDs
were prepared using bean pod and onion as raw materials via a hydrothermal
method. Considering that the reaction conditions, including the mass
ratios of precursor, reaction temperature, and time, would influence
emission wavelength and quantum yield, the reaction conditions were
optimized, and the results are listed in Table S1. First, changing the ratio of bean pod to onion, a series
of CDs were prepared. It was found that as the content of onion increases,
the maximum fluorescence emission wavelength of the prepared CDs moves
toward the long wavelength, as shown in Figure S1. The experimental results are consistent with the literature
reports: S doping causes the red shift of maximum emission wavelength.33 When the mass ratio of bean pods to onion was
set as 0.2 (dry):10 (fresh), the highest quantum yield as 5.55% was
obtained. Considering the quantum yield, the optimized mass ratios
of bean pods to onion was 0.2 (dry):10 (fresh) for the following experiment.
Subsequently, we explored the effect of temperature and time on the
properties of the prepared CDs. The results (Table S1) show that temperature and time displayed little effect
on the emission wavelength but significantly affected quantum yield.
Taking quantum yield as the main indicator, the optimal experimental
conditions were finally determined to be 180 °C and 8 h. The
final product was freeze-dried to obtain the solid product and characterized
in detail to study the elements and surface groups. It should be noted
that since the precursors are fresh produce from the local market,
different batches of raw materials or the seasonal changes of the
produce may have an impact on the property of as-prepared CDs. So,
three batches of raw materials were purchased from different supermarkets
for comparison. The results show that CDs from different raw materials
displayed different fluorescence intensities. However, the rules discussed
above were applicable.

Figure 1A shows that the prepared particles have a uniform
spherical morphology with an average size of about 6 nm calculated
using 50 particles (Figure 1B), which is larger than the CDs prepared by the chemical
reagents reported in the previous literature. Most particles were
amorphous carbon particles, only a few number of particles displayed
a lattice spacing of 0.23 nm, as shown in inset high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) images in Figure 1A. There was a broad diffraction peak centered
at 2θ = 22.6° in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra (Figure 1C), confirming the
results that the prepared S,N/CDs are amorphous.37

Figure 1 TEM images (A), particle size distribution (B), XRD pattern (C),
and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (D) of prepared S,N/CDs.
Inset are the HRTEM images of S,N/CDs.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Figure 1D) was adopted to
explore the functional
groups on the surface of S,N/CDs. Some typical peaks are listed as
follows. The broad peak at 3300 cm–1 can be attributed
to the stretching vibrations of N–H and O–H groups.
The weak peaks at 2942 and 2818 cm–1 may be assigned
to the stretching and bending vibrations of C–H groups.30 The strong peaks at 1820 and 1750 cm–1 may be attributed to the stretching vibrations of C=O groups
in the COOH,19 and the band at 1155 cm–1 can be assigned to C–N, C–S, and C–O
bonds.33

The element contents and
surface groups of the prepared S,N/CDs
were further characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). The four peaks at 166.4, 285.3, 399.2, and 531.5 eV of full-range
XPS (Figure 2) spectra
verified the existence of S, C, N, and O elements. There were four
kinds of carbon atoms displayed in the high-resolution C 1s XPS spectrum,
including carboxylic group at 288.2 eV, C–S/C–N/C–O
at 286.4 eV, C=C at 285.2 eV, and C–C at 284.5 eV. Two
peaks displayed in high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum can be ascribed
to N–H (399.2 eV) and C–N/N–N/S–N (399.9
eV), respectively.33 The peaks at 163.3
and 164.3 eV in S 2p XPS spectrum may be ascribed to C–S–C
covalent bond in the thiophene-S19 and
the peaks at 165.3 and 166.2 eV may be ascribed to the −C–SO2– and −C–SO3– bonds,
respectively.33 According to the FT-IR
and XPS results, we can draw the conclusion that sulfur and nitrogen
were successfully doped into CDs. Some typical functional groups,
such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino, existed on the surface of prepared
S,N/CDs. It should be noted that since two kinds of raw materials
were adopted, complicated chemical reactions occurred in the preparation
process to produce a plurality of functional groups. Some functional
groups may not be detected due to their low content.

S,N/CDs and the higher solution peaks for

Optical Properties of S,N/CDs
The optical properties
of as-prepared S,N/CDs were characterized in detail. Figure 3A displays the UV–vis
absorption spectrum of N/CDs and S,N/CDs. For the light yellow N/CDs
solution, a strong absorption peak at 270 nm can be observed. For
the S,N/CDs, the absorption peak at 270 nm splits into two peaks at
268 and 272 nm, which may be ascribed to the n–π*
transition of N=C and S=C bonds, respectively.30 The fluorescence spectrum of S,N/CDs was recorded. Figure 3A displays that the
fluorescence emission spectrum of the S,N/CDs was excitation-wavelength-dependent.
When the excitation wavelength changed from 310 to 380 nm, the emission
wavelength changed from 410 to 450 nm. The fluorescence spectrum has
optimal excitation and emission wavelengths at 350 and 430 nm, respectively.
This excitation-dependent phenomenon may be due to the diverse emissive
trap sites of the S,N/CDs.33

Figure 3 (A) UV–vis
absorption, photoluminescence excitation, and
excitation-dependent emission spectra of the S,N/CDs in an aqueous
solution; (B) FL intensity response (F/F0) of S,N/CDs toward various metal ions (Ag+, 50 μM; Na+ and K+, 1 mM; Co2+, Zn2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Pb2+, Hg2+, and Cu2+, 500 μM).

The photo stability and chemical stability were
quite necessary
for practical sensing applications, so the stability of S,N/CDs against
UV irradiation, ionic strengths, and pH was investigated. Figure S2A indicates that S,N/CDs displayed tolerance
to UV light. Continuous UV light irradiation for 4 h only caused a
11% fluorescence intensity change. The fluorescence intensity did
not display significant change when the pH was changed from 6.0 to
9.0. Under extreme acidic or basic condition, the fluorescence intensity
of S,N/CDs would decrease (Figure S2B).
Hydrogen bonding is likely to occur between the hydroxyl groups on
the surface of the CDs under acidic conditions, which resulted in
the quenching of CDs. Under basic conditions, the electronic transition
of the functional groups may be affected, thereby affecting the fluorescent
properties of the CDs. At the same time, the fluorescence intensity
of S,N/CDs remains stable at high salt concentrations (even at the
NaCl concentration of 1 M) (Figure S2C).
The stability of the CDs offers possibilities for metal ion detection
in real water samples.

The response of the S,N/CDs to various
ions was examined. From Figure 3B, we can see that
Ag+ can induce the sharply fluorescent quenching of the
S,N/CDs, while other metal ions, including Na+, K+, Co2+, Zn2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Fe2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, and Cu2+, did not
cause an obvious fluorescent intensity decrease. It should be pointed
out that Fe3+ also can induce obvious fluorescent quenching
of the S,N/CDs. Considering that Fe3+ can be reduced to
Fe2+ by ascorbic acid and Fe2+ cannot quench
the S,N/CDs, S,N/CDs can be employed to detect Ag+ when
ascorbic acid is used as a masking agent for Fe3+.19

Fluorescence Sensing of Ag+ Based on the S,N/CDs
The performance of S,N/CDs to Ag+ in buffer solution
was studied. Upon adding Ag+ to the S,N/CDs, fluorescent
intensity decreased gradually with increasing concentration of Ag+, as shown in Figure 4A. A linear relationship could be set up between F0/F at 430 nm and the concentration of
Ag+ from 0.1 to 25 μM with coefficient R2 = 0.997 (Figure 4B). The limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 37 nM
based on three times the standard deviation rule. Compared with the
most recently reported CDs, the prepared S,N/CDs showed a higher sensitivity
and closer or lower detection limit for Ag+ detection (Table S2). The maximum level of Ag+ in drinking water set by the World Health Organization (WHO) was
about 930 nM. So the sensitivity of the method can meet the demand
for silver ion detection in real drinking water.

the S,N/CDs upon the addition of various
concentrations of Ag+ from 0 to 50 μM (A); relationship

and presence of Ag+, respectively (B); and FL intensity

(E); and relationship between A450/A270 and the concentration of Ag+,
where A450 and A270 are the absorbances of S,N/CDs at 450 and 270 nm; the inset
picture is the S,N/CDs solution with different concentrations of Ag+ under sunlight (F).

The competition experiments of the established
method toward Ag+ detection were carried out (Figure 4C). As discussed
above, the presence of Fe3+ interferes with the detection
of Ag+. As Fe3+ was reduced by ascorbic acid
to Fe2+, the interference
of Fe3+ can be eliminated. The presence of other ions,
such as Na+, K+, Co2+, Zn2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Fe2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, and Cu2+, does not cause significant interference with
the detection of Ag+. The results suggest that S,N/CDs
displayed high selectivity toward Ag+ detection when the
interference of Fe3+ is masked using ascorbic acid. The
sensitivity and the selectivity of the method guaranteed Ag+ detection in real water samples.

Sensing Mechanism
Many mechanisms have been reported
to explain the quenching effect of metal ions on CDs, such as electron
transfer (ET), inner filter effect (IFE), and Förster resonance
energy transfer (FRET) or synergistic interaction. The average fluorescence
lifetime of S,N/CDs decayed from 5.1256 (τ1 = 2.193,
τ2 = 6.835) to 5.0645 ns (τ1 = 2.073,
τ2 = 6.684) (Figure 4D) after the addition of Ag+ ion. Minor
fluorescence lifetime change indicated that the quenching process
belongs to static quenching. The processes of FRET and dynamic quenching
reduce the fluorescence lifetime of CDs, so the possibility of FRET
mechanism was excluded. Ag+ can chelate with CDs, which
facilitate charge transfer from the excited state of the CDs to Ag+ and results in fluorescence quenching. The process of ET
has no effect on the UV–vis spectra of CDs. However, the UV–vis
spectra of S,N/CDs changed obviously after the addition of Ag+, as seen in Figure 4E, which can exclude the exertion of ET mechanisms. The IFE
is based on the absorption of the excitation or emission light by
absorbers in the detection system, and the key point is that the absorption
spectra of the absorbers overlap with the fluorescence excitation
or emission spectra of fluorophores. However, for silver ions, there
was no obvious UV–vis absorption, and the IFE between Ag+ and S,N/CDs was excluded. There was an IFE possibility between
Ag+ chelation and S,N/CDs. It is often accompanied by very
obvious changes in the color of the solution. UV–vis absorption
spectra of S,N/CDs before and after the addition of silver ions were
recorded.

Interestingly, when Ag+ ions were added
to the S,N/CDs buffer solution with the final concentration of 20
μM, the light yellow color of the S,N/CDs solution displayed
no obvious change for the first 5 min. At about 10 min, the color
of the mixture solution changed from yellow to brown. Meanwhile, a
new absorbance peak at 450 nm appeared and increased too. For the
S,N/CDs, the optimal emission wavelengths at 430 nm overlap with the
newly appeared absorption spectrum. However, ultimately, the possibility
of IFE was excluded due to the following two aspects. First, the process
of IFE has no effect on the UV–vis spectra of CDs. Figure 4E shows that the
absorption peak around 270 nm, which belongs to S,N/CDs, increased
after the addition of Ag+, which can exclude the exertion
of IFE mechanism. Second, when Ag+ coordinated with functional
groups on the surface of S,N/CDs, the solution was transparent and
stable, and no floccules occurred. For the solution of S,N/CDs with
the addition of Ag+, after standing overnight, black precipitate
was found at the bottom of the bottle, and the upper solution became
clear and transparent, as displayed in Figure 4E (the inset photos).

Ultimately, we
hypothesize that the quenching mechanism may be
ascribed to aggregation induced quenching. And the aggregation stems
from the formation of flocculation. As discussed above, in the solution
of S,N/CDs with the addition of Ag+, after standing overnight,
black precipitate was found at the bottom of the bottle, and the upper
solution became clear and transparent. The TEM images of S,N/CDs before
and after the addition of Ag+ were observed (Figure S3). As displayed in Figure S3, big particles were observed after the addition
of silver ions. This is the reason why the mixed solution precipitated.
Similar phenomenon of flocculation has been reported by Dai’s
team.38 In their work, Ag+ was
reduced to silver nanoparticles by Si-CDs@DA, and the formation of
silver nanoparticles can be confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) analysis of the obtained flocculation, which contains silver
atoms. When Ag+ was added to S,N/CDs, Ag+ can
be reduced to silver nanoparticles by S,N/CDs. The formation of flocculation
and the fluorescence quenching response may be attributed to the synergistic
interaction between S,N/CDs and Ag+. When 20 μM Ag+ was added to N/CDs, there was no noticeable color change
and flocculation was observed, even after a day. We conclude that
the reduction of Ag+ was due to the S containing groups.
The zeta potential value of S,N/CDs was −0.693 mV. After the
addition of Ag+, the value changed to −7.70 mV,
which means that some positive charge of the groups was oxidated and
shielded. The functional groups of CDs prepared from natural materials
are complex, so the quenching mechanism needs to be further verified
in future work.

Colorimetric Sensing of Ag+ Based on the S,N/CDs
Considering that S,N/CDs solution displayed significant color changes
from light yellow to deeper brown after adding Ag+ under
sunlight, colorimetric sensing of Ag+ based on S,N/CDs
can be carried out. When increasing the concentration of Ag+ up to 20 μM, the absorbance at 270 nm increased. Meanwhile,
a new absorbance peak at 450 nm appeared and increased too. When further
increasing the concentration of Ag+, the absorbance at
270 nm began to decrease, accompanied by a further increase at 450
nm. From Figure 4F,
we can see that a linear relationship could be set up between A450/A270 calculated
from the UV-absorbance spectrum and the concentration of Ag+ from 0.2 to 5 μM and 10 to 50 μM, respectively. The
limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 76 nM by UV–vis
detection. Only the addition of silver ions causes color change of
the S,N/CDs. When the concentration of silver ions exceeds 0.5 μM,
the color change can be observed by the naked eye. Colorimetric detection
can be used to quickly and semiquantitatively detect whether Ag+ exceeds the standard in water samples.

Practical Application in Real Water Sample
S,N/CDs
were applied for Ag+ detection in river water and tap water
samples. No silver ions were detected from real water samples, so
water samples were spiked with standard Ag+ solution to
verify the accuracy of the method. As shown in Table 1, recoveries higher than 96.0% and analytical
precision with relative standard deviation (RSD) lower than 4.1% were
obtained. Meanwhile, to verify the accuracy of this method, atomic
absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was also employed to measure the concentrations
of Ag+, and the results are listed in Table 1. It can be observed that the
concentrations of Ag+ measured by S,N/CDs are similar to
those detected by AAS. The results confirmed the reliability and feasibility
of the S,N/CDs for monitoring Ag+ in real water samples.

Method Performance Comparison
The performance of the
established method for detection of silver ions was compared with
the previously reported fluorescence methods, as listed in Table S2. Compared with other CDs by green preparation
method using one kind of raw material (potato, papaya or pineapple
peel), in this work, the CDs were prepared by two biomass, and S and
N co-doping was achieved. For the detection mode, most of the green
prepared CDs were used for fluorescence single mode detection. In
this work, colorimetric and fluorescent dual mode were employed for
silver ion detection. In terms of detection sensitivity, all the CDs
detection of metal
ions displayed nanomolar sensitivity.
When comparing this work with other silver ion detection methods based
on CDs, it displayed similar sensitivity. However, S,N/CDs were prepared
by a green method, which has the advantages of being environmentally
friendly and economical.

Intracellular Imaging of Ag+
For silver
ion detection in living cells, S,N/CDs must have superior biocompatibility
and high sensitivity. The cytotoxicity of the S,N/CDs was evaluated
by the cck-8 assay. More than 91.2% cells survive after incubation
with S,N/CDs at concentration 50 μg mL–1 for
24 h, and more than 82.6% cells survive after being cultured with
S,N/CDs even at concentration 200 μg mL–1 for
24 h (Figure 5). The
cytotoxicity study indicates that S,N/CDs have good biocompatibility
and ignorable cytotoxicity. Therefore, S,N/CDs could be used in imaging
and detection of sliver ions in living cells.

Figure 5 Cellular cytotoxicity
of the S,N/CDs.

Figure 6 shows the
intracellular imaging of the 4T1 cells after incubation with 200 μg
mL–1 S,N/CDs combined with different concentrations
of Ag+ for 24 h, which were achieved with distinct laser
excitations. The second line of the confocal laser fluorescence microscope
(CLFM) images are without Ag+, which serve as the control.
The 4T1 cells emit strong blue fluorescence under 405 nm excitation
after incubation with 200 μg mL–1 S,N/CDs
for 24 h (Figure 6A2),
which indicates the promising membrane permeability of S,N/CDs. A
much lower fluorescence intensity was observed after Ag+ was added into the culture medium. Higher Ag+ concentration
and the lower fluorescence intensity (Figure 6A3,A4) indicate that the fluorescence of
S,N/CDs was effectively quenched by Ag+ in living cells.
To locate the distribution of S,N/CDs in cells, we labeled the cell
lysosomes with LysoTracker Deep Red, as shown in the first line of Figure 6. The Pearson’s
correlation and overlap coefficient from three independent experiments
are shown in Table S3. As a result, the
S,N/CDs could enter into cells, and some of them distributed in lysosomes
(Table S3). As we expected, the results
proved that S,N/CDs could be used as the effective probe for semiquantitative
detection of Ag+ in living cells.

Conclusions
In summary, a simple, economical, and environmentally
friendly
strategy for preparation of S,N/CDs using bean pods and onion as precursors
was developed. S,N/CDs could be selectively quenched by Ag+ ion. The as-prepared S,N/CDs could be used for the fluorescence
turn-off detection of Ag+ in the range of 0.1–25
μM with a limit of detection of 37 nM. S,N/CDs also can be used
for on-site fast colorimetric detection of Ag+ based on
the color change under sunlight. Furthermore, S,N/CDs showed superior
biocompatibility and high sensitivity in the semiquantitative detection
of Ag+ in living cells.

In general, the present work
provides a green approach for the
production of fluorescent CDs for metal ion detection.

Preparation of S,N/CDs
Hydrothermal method was adopted
for green synthesis of S,N/CDs using bean pod and onion as precursor.
Fresh bean pods were dried and ground into powder and fresh onion
was ground into a slurry. Then, 0.2 g of the bean pod powder and 2
g of fresh onion slurry were dispersed in 30 mL of ultrapure water
and heated at 180 °C for 8 h in a Teflon-lined autoclave. The
resultant brown solution was centrifuged and dialyzed to get a transparent
clear solution and then stored at 4 °C for further use. For control,
N/CDs were prepared using only bean pod as precursor. As-prepared
CDs were freeze-dried and weighed to determine the concentration of
the CDs aqueous solution.

Detection of Silver (I) Ions
S,N/CDs were dispersed
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer solution (25.0 mM, pH 7.0)
with a final concentration of 50 μg L–1. Ag+ standard solutions (10 μL) with different concentrations
were added to 4.0 mL of S,N/CDs buffer solution. Silver ions and CDs
were fully reacted for 5 min, and then the fluorescence detection
was performed. To study the specificity of the sensing system, the
effect of other ions (including Na+, K+, Co2+, Zn2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Pb2+, Hg2+, and Cu2+)
on the fluorescence intensity of S,N/CDs was also investigated. All
fluorescence detection was performed at room temperature.

Real Sample Detection
River water from Yi river (Linyi,
Shandong) and tap water from our laboratory were collected to explore
the feasibility of the proposed method in real samples. After filtration
with a 0.22 μm membrane to remove the sediments, silver ions
were spiked into the river water sample. Then, S,N/CDs solution was
mixed with 4.0 mL of spiked river sample with a final concentration
of 50 μg L–1. The concentration of Ag+ in water samples was detected using the above developed method.
Tap water was used without further purification.

Cytotoxicity Assay
The cytotoxicity of S,N/CDs for
4T1 cells in vitro was performed by the cck-8 assay. 4T1 cells were
cultured in the culture medium of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle
medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified
5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. When the cells proliferate
to around 70% of the cell culture flasks, the cells were harvested
to seed in 96-well plates and cultured in the medium containing the
S,N/CDs with various concentrations for 24 h. The wells containing
cells without S,N/CDs served as the control. After 24 h, each well
was washed with D-Hanks twice before the test. Then, each well was
treated by the addition of 100 μL of the mixed solution (90
μL of fresh culture medium and 10 μL of cck-8) and incubated
for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, the optical density
(OD) of each well at 450 nm was recorded.

Cell Imaging
The 4T1 cells were harvested to seed in
culture dishes with approximately 2 × 105 4T1 cells/2
mL and then cultured overnight. Afterward, S,N/CDs were added to the
dishes with a final concentration of 200 μg mL–1 in the culture medium for further 24 h culture. To understand the
biodistribution of CDs in cells, the cell lysosomes were stained by
LysoTracker Deep Red for co-location. The fluorescence quenching of
Ag+ was detected by adding 200 μg mL–1 S,N/CDs combined with Ag+ of different concentrations
(1 and 10 μM) to culture dishes. Before the cells were imaged
by the laser scanning confocal microscope, the cell membrane was stained
by Cell Mask Orange plasma membrane stain.
