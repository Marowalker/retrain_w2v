The
radial mixing characteristics of gas and solid phases in a
cylindrical spouted bed with a pair of longitudinal vortex generators
(LVGs) are numerically studied by a two-fluid model. The influence
of the distance between the centers of two spheres (L) and the shape of LVGs on hydrodynamics in a spouted bed are discussed.
The results show that the value of the coefficient of variation (CV)
of the particle concentration can be significantly reduced by the
longitudinal vortex produced in spouted beds. The particle concentration
near the spout decreases first and then increases with the increase
of L. When the shape of LVGs is cylindrical, a maximum
increase of 188 % for particle volume fraction is found near the spout
region of the spouted bed. The strengthening effect on particles’
velocity achieves the best in annulus of the spouted bed, and CV of
the particle concentration in the spouted bed reaches its minimum
value with a pair of cylindrical LVGs.

1 Introduction
In the chemical and metallurgical
industries, the spouted beds
have been used in many applications such as coating, drying, mixing,
and coal gasification.1,2 Many experimental testing and
numerical simulations of spouted beds have been performed to determine
the physics of gas–solid processes.3−9,9−29 Devahastin et al.3 experimentally developed
a rotating jet annular spouted bed dryer for drying of particles in
the falling rate period. Parise et al.4 studied the flow behavior of a slot-rectangular spouted bed of biomass
particles with simultaneous injection of jet and pulsating airflow.
Kiani et al.5 experimentally studied the
mixing and segregation of binary mixtures of particles with different
densities and sizes in a spouted bed. Recently, Breault et al.6,7 experimentally studied the flow behavior of gas and particles in
a spouted bed under two different nozzle sizes. They also analyzed
the spout characteristics and minimum spouting velocity of a flat-base
spout-fluidized bed under different static heights. The pressure fluctuation
of high-density zirconia particles (6200 kg/m3) in a three-dimensional
(3D) conical spouted bed was studied by Rao et al.8 using a high strength microphone. Estiati et al.9 conducted a study on the influence of geometrical
dimensions and structures of a restraint pipe and draft tube on entrainment,
working pressure drop, working air flow rate, and maximum cycle time.
The TFM approach has been widely used for simulating practical gas–solid
flow behavior in spouted beds.10−18,36 Lan et al.11 numerically analyzed the effect of specularity coefficient
and particle–wall restitution coefficient on hydrodynamics
of spouted beds using a two-fluid model method. Wang et al.12 compared the experimental results and numerical
simulations of hydrodynamics in a conical spouted bed. Jiang et al.13 numerically studied the hydrodynamics in a pressurized
spouted bed with absolute pressure elevated to 1.0 MPa using three-dimensionally
numerical simulation and TFM method. Hossein et al.14 numerically studied the gas–solid flow behavior
and transient gas to particle heat transfer for spouted regime using
the TFM approach. Du et al.15 investigated
particle mixing and segregation in spouted beds with binary mixtures
of particles by a numerical simulation method. Ludwig et al.16 verified the applicability of the two-fluid
model for the description of gas–solid flow behavior in a circulating
dilute spouted fluidized bed. Sun et al.17 investigated the hydrodynamics of ultrafine powders in a conical
spouted bed with coarse particles using the TFM method, and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
method was used to describe the particle number change. Wu et al.18 numerically simulated and optimized the gas–solid
flow behavior in an integral multijet spout-fluidized bed using the
TFM method.

The discrete element method (DEM) can capture more
accurately the
physics of gas–solid flow processes. However, with the increase
of the number of particles, the computational cost of the DEM becomes
higher. In recent years, a novel computational fluid dynamics (CFD)–DEM
model coupling heat and mass transfer in a spout-fluidized bed with
liquid injection has been built by Sutkar et al.20 Xu et al.22 analyzed the hydrodynamics
of cohesive particles in a spouted bed by means of CFD–DEM.
Golshan et al.24,25 numerically investigated the
influence of bed geometry on the gas–solid flow behavior of
slot-rectangular spouted beds by the CFD–DEM. A modified DEM
was used by Takabatake et al.26 to simulate
the effectiveness of the coarse-grain model in solid mixing in a spouted
bed. Also, a coupled CFD–DEM method was adopted by Breuninger
et al.29 to simulate the hydrodynamics
of fine, cohesive powders in a spouted bed equipped with a Wurster
tube.

Generally speaking, a conventional spouted bed is divided
into
three different regions: a spout at the center, a fountain region,
and an annulus region between the spout and the column wall. The radial
mixing of gas and particles between spout and annulus regions is not
sufficient. The longitudinal vortex technique has been employed extensively
to enhance the thermal efficiency of heat exchangers.30−35 Fiebig30 described the application of
the wing-type vortex generator technique in compact heat exchangers.
The research progress of longitudinal vortex generators (LVGs) and
nanofluids for heat transfer enhancement is reviewed by Ahmed et al.31 Hsiao et al.32 studied
the mixing characteristics in the T-shaped channel with LVGs mounted
on the bottom of the main channel. Datta et al.33 studied fluid flow and heat transfer behavior in microchannel
using inclined LVG through the numerical simulation method. Ebrahimi
et al.34,35 numerically investigated heat transfer and
fluid flow for nanofluid flow in a rectangular microchannel heat sink
with LVGs. Recently, a preliminary numerical simulation of the longitudinal
vortex effect on gas–solid flow behavior in a spouted bed was
carried out by Wu et al.36,37 They compared the hydrodynamics
in three types of spouted beds: without disturbance units, with a
pair of balls and with a pair of LVGs. They also numerically analyzed
the effect of the row number of LVGs on gas–solid flow behaviors
in a novel spouted bed. However, the structural parameters of LVGs
have not been optimized for design, such as the effect of distance
between two centers of sphere (L) installed on the
LVGS and different shapes of LVGs on hydrodynamics in a spouted bed.

The objective of the present work is to three dimensionally simulate
and optimize the effect of L and different shapes
of LVGs on gas–solid flow behaviors in a spouted bed and to
optimize these structural parameters. Numerical simulation and analysis
work have been conducted on four kinds of spouted beds: conventional
spouted bed, the spouted bed with a pair of LVGs, and the distance
between two centers of spheres installed on LVG (L) equals 30, 35, and 40 mm, respectively. Also, different shapes
of LVGs are studied with a constant L (L = 30 mm): with a pair of spherical LVGs, with a pair of cylindrical
LVGs, and with a pair of conical LVGs. The radius of sphere on LVG
is kept constant as R = 10 mm (Table 1).

2 Numerical Procedure
2.1 CFD Model
The Eulerian–Eulerian
two-fluid model is adopted to implement the gas–particle flow
simulations in a spouted bed, and both the gas and solid phases are
assumed to be the interpenetrating continuous phase. Generalized Navier–Stokes
equations are employed for the interacting continua. Based on the
kinetic theory of granular flows,39 both
the pressure of solid phase and the viscous force can be described
as functions of the granular temperature.40 The Schaeffer model is used to represent the stress of solid phase,
which is due to frictional interactions between particles41 and the diffusion coefficient of granular energy
by the Gidaspow model38 is used. As for
the governing equations and constitutive relations for spouted beds,
they can be referred to ref (36). The dispersed turbulence model, in which turbulence predictions
for gas phase are obtained by the standard k-ω model supplemented
with extra terms including the inter-phase turbulent momentum transfer,
has been adopted.36

2.2 Model
Validation and Simulation Conditions
A spouted bed with LVGs
was investigated experimentally, and the
physical model and geometry of spouted beds with LVGs are illustrated
in Figure1. Particle
image velocimetry42 was applied to explore
effects of longitudinal vortex flow and physical properties of particles
on radial velocity of particles in a spouted bed with LVGs. Figure 2 shows the experimental
setup and the comparison of radial velocity of particles between experimental
data and simulation results. The simulation data of radial velocity
of particles are consistent with the experimental results and the
maximum deviation is less than 22.5%.

The governing equations presented in Section 2.1 are solved by the CFD code Fluent 15.
For equations related to momentum, turbulence kinetic energy, and
turbulence dissipation rate, a second-order upwind discretization
scheme is adopted, while for the volume fraction term, a first-order
upwind scheme is chosen. The time step in unsteady simulations was
set to 1 × 10–5 s. When the scaled residuals
were less than 1 × 10–3 for all variables,
the solution was considered converged. A grid independence analysis
has been made in Wu et al.,36 in which
452 452, 608 515, 620 682, and 608 774
grid cells have been adopted for four cases of spouted beds, namely,
without disturbance units (case A), with LVGs and the distance between
two centers of spheres installed on LVG (L) equaling
20 mm (case B), 25 mm (case C), and 30 mm (case D), respectively.
The total number of grid cells are 611595 and 613823 for spouted beds:
with a pair of cylindrical LVGs (case E) and with a pair of conical
LVGs (case F).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Influence of L on Particle
Concentrations
In order to consider the effect of distance
between centers of two spheres (L) on gas–solid
flow behavior in spouted beds, the radius of sphere located on LVG
is kept constant as R = 10 mm (Figure 3). The comparison of particle concentrations
is illustrated in Figure 4 for case A–case F with a velocity of 0.864 m/s for
the inlet gas jet at stable state (U = 1.6Ums). It is evident from this figure that the
fountain height increases with the increase of L in
a spouted bed with LVGs because the cross-sectional area of the flow
channel in a spout zone increases with the increase of L. Compared with other cases, the height of the fountain in case E
is the lowest, which indicates that case E has the maximum axial flow
resistance at the same design size of LVGs.

beds for different
values of L and shapes of LVGs. (a) Case A, (b) case
B, (c) case C, (d) case D, (e) case E, and (f) case F.

Figure 5 shows the
comparison of velocity vectors of gas and solid particles in the longitudinal
cross section of spouted beds for case A–case F. The existence
of LVGs leads to the radial velocity distribution and secondary vortex
flow of gas and particle phases, which strengthens the radial mixing
of particles in spout and annulus, thus strengthening the momentum
exchange between particles and gas. The resistance of axial movement
of particles increases when LVGs are adopted, which consumes the kinetic
energy of particles, and the velocity direction of particles changes
after collision between particles and LVGs. Also, it can be seen from Figure 5 that the secondary
vortex flow generated by gas and particles is the most significant
when the shape of LVGs is cylindrical (case E).

solid particle velocity vectors in the longitudinal
cross section of spouted beds. Gas phase: (a) case A, (b) case B,

F.

Figure 6 displays
particle concentration distributions along the radial direction in
case A–case D at different spouted bed levels for U = 1.6Ums. It can be seen from Figure 6 that, compared with
the simulation results in conventional spouted bed (case A), the profiles
of particle concentration along the radial direction become more smooth
in spouted bed under the effect of a longitudinal vortex. The value
of concentration of particles near spout decreases first and then
increases with the increase of L. The particle volume
fraction is close to a constant value in the annulus and the longitudinal
vortex has little effect on that because the particle concentration
in annulus is too large.

Figure 6 Particle concentration profile in the cross
section of spouted
beds for different values of L. (a) z = 0.17 m, (b) z = 0.2 m.

In order to analyze the improved quality of the spouted bed
structure,
the coefficient of variation (CV) of particle concentration is used
to analyze the uniformity of particles’ distribution 1   2  where S is the standard deviation,
εsj is the particle volume fraction
of sampling point,  is
the average particle volume fraction
of all sampling points, and n is the number of samples,
which equals the total number of grid cells in the spouted bed. The
comparison of CV of particles’ concentration in spouted beds
is shown in Figure 7 for different values of L. It can be observed that,
compared to a conventional spouted bed (case A), the magnitude of
CV has been significantly reduced by the longitudinal vortex produced
in spouted beds. When L equals 30 mm, CV reaches
its minimum value and then increases with the increase of N, finally it reaches a stable value.

concentration in spouted
beds for different values of L.

3.2 Influence of L on Flow of
Gas and Particle Phases
Figure 8 displays the profile of magnitude of particles’
velocities along the radial direction in a spouted bed at different
heights of case A–case D. It can be obviously seen that the
magnitude velocity of particles in a spouted bed can be enhanced significantly
by a longitudinal vortex, especially in the annular region. The strengthening
degree of particles’ velocity by LVGs increases with the increase
of the spouted bed height (z), which indicates that
the strength and influence range of the longitudinal vortex gradually
increase with the increase of the bed height (z).
The value of velocity of particles in spout increases first and then
decreases with the increase of L.

Figure 8 Velocity profile of particle
phase along the radial direction in
four kinds of spouted beds for different values of L. (a) z = 0.17 m (b) z = 0.2 m.

Figure 9 shows the
radial distribution of turbulent kinetic energy of gas phase in case
A–case D at z = 0.17 m. It can be seen from Figure 9 that the value of
turbulent kinetic energy of gas phase along the radial direction in
a spouted bed can be significantly promoted by a longitudinal vortex;
especially near the spout region, the turbulent kinetic energy of
the gas phase profile is symmetric about the central axis of the spouted
bed. Because of the boundary effect of LVGs, a minimum value of gas
turbulent kinetic energy can be found in the center of the spout zone.
With the increase of L, the turbulent kinetic energy
of particles in spout decreases first and then increases, and the
turbulent kinetic energy of gas phase along axial direction can be
significantly intensified by a longitudinal vortex simultaneously.

of turbulent kinetic energy of gas phase along the radial
and axial direction in four kinds of spouted beds for different values
of L (z = 0.17 m). (a) Radial direction
and (b) axial direction.

3.3 Influence of Shapes of LVGs
To consider
the effect of LVG shape on gas–solid flow behavior in a spouted
bed, the distance between two sphere centers is kept constant as L = 30 mm (Figure 10). Figure 11 shows the radial distribution of particle concentration at different
heights for U = 1.6Ums in four types of spouted beds. It can be observed that compared
with other cases, the value of particle concentration in the central
spout region of case E is the highest, the second highest is case
B, and then case F, which indicates that with the increase of LVGs’
volume, the effect of a longitudinal vortex on the enhancement of
particles’ movement increases, and the intensity of a longitudinal
vortex increases with the increase of the LVGs’ volume. When
the shape of LVGs is cylindrical, the strengthening effect on particles’
horizontal movement achieves the best, and then for the particle volume
fraction, a maximum increase of 188% is achieved near the spout region
of the spouted bed. Figure 12 compares the value of CV of particle concentration in spouted
beds with LVGs of different shapes. As shown in Figure 12, there exists a lowest value
of CV in a spouted bed for LVGs of different shapes. The value of
CV in a spouted bed reaches its maximum value in case A, while it
reaches its minimum value with a pair of cylindrical LVGs (case E),
which indicates that the cylindrical shape for LVGs can make the particle
concentration distribution the most uniform in the spouted bed, and
under the influence of the cylindrical shape of LVGs, the particles
in the spouted bed can be fully mixed between spout and annulus.

model and meshes of spouted beds with different shapes

types of spouted beds for different shapes of LVGs. (a) z = 0.17 m and (b) z = 0.2 m.

Figure 12 Comparison of CV of particles’ concentration in spouted
beds for different shapes of LVGs.

Also, the influence of shapes of LVGs on magnitude velocity
and
granular temperature of particle phase in a spouted bed is reflected
in Figures 13 and 14. It can be seen from Figure 13 that when the shape of the LVGs is cylindrical
(case E), the strengthening effect of particles velocity achieves
the best in annulus of the spouted bed, revealing that the increase
of LVGs’ volume is helpful to the rise of longitudinal eddy
strengthening effect on particles’ transversal mixing in a
spouted bed, and the optimum shape for LVG is cylindrical under a
certain fluid mechanics condition. As observed in Figure 14a,b, compared with the conventional
spouted bed (case A), the value of granular temperature in annulus
can be increased by LVGs. Also, the increase of granular temperature
reaches its maximum value in case E under the influence of the longitudinal
vortex. The decrease of granular temperature in the spout region reveals
that under the effect of the longitudinal vortex, the radial motion
of the particles is enhanced and the radial momentum exchange in particle
swarm is strengthened. The collision frequency between particles can
be increased by the increase of radial motion and turbulent kinetic
energy of the gas phase. As the pulsating kinetic energy of particles’
random motion is reflected by the granular temperature, the loss of
kinetic energy of the particle pulsation is caused, and the granular
temperature decreases to a certain extent.

0.17 m and (b) z = 0.2 m.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, 3D gas–solid two phase flow characteristics
in a novel spouted bed structure under the longitudinal vortex effects
were numerically studied. The effect of distance between a pair of
spherical (L) and shapes of LVGs on hydrodynamics
in spouted beds is discussed. The main conclusions of the present
paper are as follows:(1) The longitudinal vortex has a significant
effect on the radial distribution of the particle concentration in
the spouted bed and the secondary vortex flow emerges for gas and
particle phases. The value of particle concentration near the spout
decreases first and then increases with the increase of L. The particle volume fraction in the annulus approaches a constant
value and the longitudinal vortex has little effect on particle volume
fraction in the annulus region.

(2) The value of velocity of particles
in spout increases first and then decreases with the increase of L, and the value of turbulent kinetic energy of gas phase
along radial and axial directions in a spouted bed can be significantly
promoted by a longitudinal vortex near the spout region.

(3) The increase of LVGs’ volume
is beneficial for the rise of the longitudinal eddy strengthening
effect on particles transverse mixing in a spouted bed, and the optimum
shape of LVG is cylindrical under a certain fluid mechanics condition.
