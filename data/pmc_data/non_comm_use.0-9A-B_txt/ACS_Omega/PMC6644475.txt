The transport and photoelectric properties of four two-dimensional
(2D) silicene/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) heterostructures
have been investigated by employing density functional theory, nonequilibrium
Green’s function, and Keldysh nonequilibrium Green’s
function methods. The stabilities of silicene (SiE) are obviously
improved after being placed on the MX2 (M = Mo, W; X =
S, Se) substrates. In particular, the conductivities of SiE/MX2 are enhanced compared with free-standing SiE and MX2. Moreover, the conductivities are increased with the group number
of X, i.e., in the order of SiE < SiE/MS2 < SiE/MSe2. An evident current oscillation phenomenon is observed in
the SiE/WX2 heterostructures. When a linear light illumination
is applied, SiE/MSe2 shows a stronger photoresponse than
SiE/MS2. The maximum photoresponse with a value of 9.0a02/photon was obtained for SiE/WSe2.
More importantly, SiE/MS2 (M = Mo, W) heterostructures
are good candidates for application in designing solar cells owing
to the well spatial separation of the charge carriers. This work provides
some clues for further exploring 2D SiE/MX2 heterostructures
involving tailored photoelectric properties.

1 Introduction
In recent
years, tremendous attention has been focused on two-dimensional
(2D) group-IV monolayers because of their unique physical properties
and potential applications in the electronic industry.1−4 As
the most representative 2D material, graphene, a sp2-hybridized
carbon monolayer, has attracted wide interest due to its peculiar
electronic properties which allow electrons to move freely in its
surface with high speed.5,6 However, it lacks an
intrinsic band gap, which makes electronic applications of graphene
difficult for electronic devices.7,8 Two-dimensional
silicene (SiE),9−13 another well-known
sp2–sp3 hybridized group-IV monolayer,
has most similar remarkable electronic properties to graphene.14 Differently, free-standing SiE is estimated
to be the subject to a slight buckling15,16 with the height
of approximately 0.44 Å due to sp2–sp3 hybridization.17−19 Therefore,
despite in the same group, SiE is not atomically flat as graphene,
suggesting that SiE may be superior to graphene in many aspects, such
as having an enhanced quantum Hall effect,20−22 electrically tunable band gap,23 and better surface reactivity.18 Another obvious advantage of SiE is the better compatibility
with current silicon-based technologies.24 Thus, SiE has been fabricated successfully on metal or other 2D
material substrates, which is of fundamental importance to enable
a wide range of nanoelectronic devices.25−27 Several experimental groups have reported the epitaxial
growth of SiE on metallic substrates such as MgX2(0001)
(X = Cl, Br, I),28,29 Ir(111),30,31 Al(111),32 and Ag(111),33−42 and found, however, that the Dirac cone of SiE can
be destroyed since the Si-π bands strongly hybridize with the
substrates.43−46 Many nonmetallic 2D materials as substrates,
including graphite,47 graphene,48 silicon,49,50 SiC,51,52 PtSe2,53 MoSi2,54 and ZrC,55 have also
been proposed and investigated theoretically. Recently, high-buckled
2D Si nanosheets have been fabricated by molecular beam epitaxial
growth on the bulk MoS2 surface.56 Zhao et al.57 have reported density functional
theory (DFT) analysis of SiE/MoS2 and addressed that silicene/MoS2 can be formed by SiE adsorbing on the MoS2 substrate
via van der Waals (vdW) interactions, and the transport behavior of
SiE/MoS2 is tuned by the interface between SiE and MoS2 substrates. The substrate under the SiE not only serves as
a mechanical support for SiE but also modulates the band gap of SiE.58,59 In particular, vdW interaction between the SiE and the substrate
makes the sublattice symmetry break, which opens the band gap.60−62 Additionally, the high carrier
mobility of 2D materials can be retained from vdW interactions, since
it does not destroy the bonding properties between intralayer atoms.
The interlayer coupling between the two vdW-stacked 2D layers can
result in novel physical properties. For example, owing to the tunable
band alignments and strong light–matter interactions, the vdW
is beneficial for light harvesting and detecting.63−66 In contrast
to other layer materials, considering the tunable band gaps of SiE
and easy integration into the modern Si-based device technologies,
studying the transport and photoelectric properties for a series of
SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se), thus, becomes a valuable
research topic.

In the present paper, calculations were performed
using DFT and nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) methods
for four SiE/MX2 heterostructures (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se)
to explore the electronic structures, transport properties, and the
photoresponses of SiE supported on MX2 (M = Mo, W; X =
S, Se). Previous investigation indicated that the band gap depends
on the rotation angle and stacking pattern, whereas the formation
energy did not.67−69 In
the present work, a series of SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S,
Se) heterostructures with a 30° rotational angle between the
base vectors of the two lattices have been investigated since such
layer stacking orientation makes a good match for modeling periodic
supercells to calculation. Moreover, due to the opened band gaps of
these structured SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se), they can
be applied as candidates of optoelectronic materials. Due to the opened
band gaps of these SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) with
such layer stacking orientation, they can be applied as candidates
of optoelectronic materials. We found that SiE attached to different
MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) substrates could introduce different
intriguing transport and photoelectric properties, which offer clues
for designing novel 2D nanoscaled electronic and optoelectronic devices.

2 Results and Discussion
The stability of SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) heterostructures
can be demonstrated by computing the binding energy (ΔEb) per supercell (Figure 1) for the total equation [MX2 +
SiE → SiE/MX2 – ΔEb], as listed in Table 1. Here, the values of ΔEb are negative for all the considered heterostructures, indicating
that the process is exothermic and the heterostructures tend to be
more stable, and hence, SiE and MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S,
Se) nanosheets yearn for stacking each other. The M–X bond
lengths (LM–X) in SiE/MX2 are 2.475–2.589 Å, close to that of 2.38–2.55
Å in pure MX2,70−74 moreover,
the Si–Si bond lengths in SiE/MX2 are 2.265 Å,
consistent with previous reported values of 2.25–2.27 Å
for pure SiE.75−77 The
balance distances between SiE and MX2 (RSiE/MX2) are in the range of 2.630–2.794
Å (cf. Table 1), in line with the experimental data for SiE on the bulk MoS2 surface (RSiE/MoS2 = 3 Å)56 and other theoretical report
(RSiE/MoS2 = 2.93 Å).78 Such separations are longer than the typical
covalent Si–S and Si–Se bond lengths of 2.019–2.345
Å,79,80 indicating a vdW interaction between SiE
and MX2.

In the following sections, the results of
electronic structures of SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se)
are displayed, followed by discussing the transport properties, and
finally the photoelectric properties under linear light illumination
are analyzed.

2.1 Electronic
Structures
Figure 2 shows the electron difference densities for SiE/MX2. Clearly, SiE sheet transfers electrons to the MX2 layer,
indicating coupling between SiE and MX2, which may result
in the changing of the SiE band structure by placing on the MX2 substrates. Figures 3 and 4 show the band structures and
the average projected density of states (PDOS) of per element for
SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) as well as the corresponding
Kohn–Sham orbitals near the Fermi level (Ef). For comparison, the calculated results of free-standing
SiE are also presented in Figure 3. For the SiE sheet, linear band dispersion behavior
around the Dirac point at the Γ point in the Brillouin zone
can be seen from Figure 3. The valance band and conduction band primarily derived from the
Si 3p orbital cross at Ef, leading to
massless Dirac Fermion behavior of electrons and holds. It opens merely
a trivial band gap (Eg) about 1.8 meV.

Figure 3 Computed band
structure and PDOS of SiE, SiE/MoS2, and SiE/MoSe2 as well as the Kohn–Sham orbitals corresponding to the energy
levels (highlighted in color lines) near Ef at the Γ point. The isosurface value is 0.006 (e/Å3).

structure and PDOS of SiE/WS2 and SiE/WSe2 as
well as the Kohn–Sham orbitals corresponding to the energy
levels (highlighted in color lines) near Ef at the Γ point. The isosurface value is 0.006 (e/Å3).

From Figures 3 and 4, it is notable that the band gaps are increased
to 0.261, 0.208, 0.212, and 0.183 eV for SiE/MoS2, SiE/MoSe2, SiE/WS2, and SiE/WSe2, respectively,
meaning that all the four MoX2 (X = S, Se) substrates enable
to stabilize the SiE nanosheet. Evidently, the band gap of SiE/MX2 decreases with the group number of M, namely, SiE/MoS2 > SiE/WS2 and SiE/MoSe2 > SiE/WSe2. What’s more, a decrease trend is also found as the
group number of X, that is, SiE/WS2 > SiE/WSe2 and SiE/MoS2 > SiE/MoSe2. Therefore, the
stability of SiE could be much more increased by placing on MoX2 surfaces compared to WX2 (X = S, Se), in particular
on MoS2. Semiconductor heterostructures are typically classified
as type-I or type-II, depending on the relative alignment of conduction-
and valence-band edges of the materials. The type-I heterostructure
(straddling gap) has the conduction- and valence-band edges in one
layer; the conduction- and valence-bands of the type-II heterostructure
(staggered gap) exist in different layers.81,82 Clearly,
the S and Se elements in the MX2 substrates play different
roles in the band structures. When SiE is attached to the MS2 (M = Mo, W) surfaces, the M d bands serve mainly as conduction bands,
consequently, the band gaps of SiE/MoS2 and SiE/WS2 are opened-up and enlarged to 0.261 and 0.212 eV, respectively.
The valence bands of SiE/MS2 (M = Mo, W) are still dominated
by the Si 3p orbitals. Therefore, the SiE/MS2 gives a type-II
heterostructure since the conduction band comes from MS2, while the valence band from the SiE. As for SiE/MSe2 (M = Mo, W), the Se element induces slight hybridization between
the M d state and the Si 3p state at the band edges, which is responsible
for increasing the band gaps to 0.208 and 0.183 eV for SiE/MoSe2 and SiE/WSe2, respectively. Different from X =
S, both valence and conduction bands in SiE/MSe2 are mainly
originated from the Si 3p orbitals. Therefore, the SiE/MSe2 gives a type-I heterostructure. Moreover, the stability of SiE is
improved after being fabricated to the MX2 (M = Mo, W;
X = S, Se) surfaces by increasing the band gaps, rendering the SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) heterostructures to be semiconductors.
Considering the component of band edges, it is found that the electrons
in SiE/MS2 (M = Mo, W) mainly undertake an indirect hopping
transport mechanism from SiE to MS2 (M = Mo, W), while
those in SiE/MSe2 (M = Mo, W) mainly carry out a direct
transport mechanism within the SiE layer.

2.2 Transport Properties
To move forward
to study the quantitative transport properties of the SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) nanostructures, two-probe devices were established
by sandwiching a supercell of considered nanostructures between the
two Au electrodes, as shown in Figure 1. It is well-known that the transport properties in
a certain direction is closely related to its topological structure.
Owing to the anisotropic structures in different directions of SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se), in this work, transport properties
along the x and z directions are
both considered. The calculated current–voltage (I–V) curves for the two-probe systems of SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) are given in Figure 5 together with those of pristine SiE for
comparison.

Figure 5 Computed currents
for SiE and SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se).

As expected from the different topological structures,
the conductivities of SiE and SiE/MX2 show an anisotropic
character in the x and z directions.
Although the pure SiE shows a negligible band gap, it behaves as an
insulated material in the z direction as can be seen
from the nearly zero current, in contrast, it shows a semiconductivity
character along the x direction with the current
value smaller than 70 μA in the considered bias region. This
anisotropic feature was also observed for SiE/graphene by Zhou et
al.83 using first-principles. Interestingly,
SiE exhibits a distinctive feature of negative differential resistance
(NDR) near ±0.8 V in the x direction. Generally,
the electric-field induced change in resistivity causes so-called
NDR effects, where the voltage appearing on both ends of the scatter
region decreases with the increasing current. Namely, the slope of
the I–V curve is negative.84−88 To gain more insight into this striking
NDR feature, we compute the transmission spectra T(E) and the density of states (DOS) of SiE at the bias of 0.6, 0.8,
and 1.0 V, respectively (Figure 6). It can be seen that the carriers transport easily
through the scatter region at the low bias of 0.6 V, owing to the
large T(E) and DOS at the Ef. When the bias rises to 0.8 V, the T(E)
and DOS peaks are lowered altogether at the Ef, leading to a drop in the current. It is noteworthy that
the channel can also be opened if the bias increases to 1.0 V. As
such, the current rises rapidly at higher biases. The striking NDR
behavior of the SiE complex may find some applications in molecular
electronics, which shows behavior similar to previous studies.89

Figure 6 (a) Transmission spectra T(E) and (b) the density of states (DOS) of SiE at the bias
of 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 V, respectively.

Attaching SiE to the MX2 (M
= Mo, W; X = S, Se) surfaces gives rise to significant changes in
the transport properties. On one hand, the conductivities of the SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) heterostructures are increased either
in the x direction or in the z direction
comparing with SiE. It is worth noting that for both directions, the
conductivities are ranked in the increasing order of the group number
X: SiE < SiE/MoS2 < SiE/MoSe2 and SiE
< SiE/WS2 < SiE/WSe2. This is in agreement
with the band gap predication mentioned above (Figures 3 and 4). In SiE/MoSe2 and SiE/WSe2, the electron transport is mainly
through a direct transport mechanism by tunneling within the SiE framework.
However, in SiE/MoS2 and SiE/WS2, the electron
transport is, by a large extent, via an indirect path by hopping from
the SiE component to the MS2 (M = Mo, W) substrates. This
is maybe the major reason for the lower conductivity of SiE/MS2 (M = Mo, W) comparing with SiE/MSe2 (M = Mo, W).
On the other hand, the MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) substrates
also influence the NDR behavior of SiE. When MoS2 or MoSe2 is placed on SiE, the NDR feature in the pure SiE vanishes
and the currents of SiE/MoX2 (X = S, Se) almost meet the
Ohm’s law regardless of the transmission direction. This evidently
attributes to the major contribution of the M d bands to the conduction
band. Similar to SiE, the x direction of SiE/MoX2 (X = S, Se) shows a higher conductivity than the z direction. At 1.0 V bias voltage, the currents of SiE/MoS2 and SiE/MoSe2 in the x direction
are up to 99.5 and 102.7 μA, respectively, while those in the z direction reach only 40.9 and 54.7 μA, respectively.
Notably, a significant current oscillation phenomenon can be observed
after attaching SiE to WX2 (X = S, Se), especially in the z direction (Figure 5). Moreover, the amplitude of the oscillation increases with
the imposed voltage. Previous literature90,91 studies
have addressed that NDR is one of the key factors for obtaining current
oscillation. As we know, transport channels in SiE/WX2 (X
= S, Se) are still dominated by the SiE sheet. The WX2 (X
= S, Se) substrates enhance the NDR effect of SiE, and as a result,
multiple NDR peaks appear continuously leading to the current oscillation.
Such character is an important issue for the design of oscillation
devices, e.g., thyristors.87

2.3 Photoelectric Properties
Figure 1 schematically
shows the structures of our devices of SiE/MX2 (M = Mo,
W; X = S, Se) for calculating photoelectric properties along the x and z directions. To this end, the scattering
region was irradiated by linearly polarized light which propagates
along the y direction. Light polarized in the x–z plane has polarization forming
an angle θ with respect to the y direction.
The photocurrents in the x and z directions were determined at different θ for photoenergies
ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 eV with an interval of 0.2 eV.

The photocurrents
of SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) under linearly polarized
light illumination are given in Figures 7–10. As known
for the linearly polarized light,92 the
photocurrent is determined by three terms which are sin2 θ, cos2 θ, and sin 2θ
components, respectively. Therefore, the photoresponse curves in Figures 7–10 take the sine or cosine shapes with θ, which
are decided by complicated factors such as the geometric symmetry
and the full band structures of the material. Note that different
MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) substrates induce different
photocurrent responses. The sign of the photocurrent varies with θ
and photon energies, as indicated in Figures 7–10. This is
due to the fact that the sign of the photocurrent is determined by
the summation of all activated electrons with different velocity distributions.
For SiE/MoS2, the x and z directions show similar photoresponses. The largest photocurrent
is found to be 1.5a02/photon
within the considered situation (Figure 7). As for SiE/MoSe2, an anisotropy
is observed in the photoresponse between the x and z directions. The amplitude of the photoresponse curves
in the z direction is greater than that in the x direction (Figure 8). The maximum photocurrent in SiE/MoSe2 is up
to 3.0 and 5.5a02/photon for
the x and z directions, respectively,
2 and 3 times larger than that in SiE/MoS2. Similar to
SiE/MoS2, SiE/WS2 shows a similar magnitude
of photocurrent in the x and z directions
(Figure 9). The maximum
value of photocurrent in SiE/WS2 is about 2.0a02/photon at the photon energy of 1.0 eV, larger
than that of SiE/MoS2 (1.5a02/photon). The photoresponse in SiE/WS2 is
not obvious until the applied photon energy reaches a threshold value
of 0.7 eV, beyond which the photoresponse is very sensitive to the
photon energy. Clearly, at 0.7–1.0 eV photon energies, the
amplitudes of the photoresponse are much higher in the z direction compared to the x direction. As for SiE/WSe2, two very high response peaks with values of about 7.0 and
9.0a02/photon are found for
the z direction, located at the photon energies of
0.2 and 0.5 eV, respectively (Figure 10). These values
are also much higher than other reported 2D materials such as S-doped
monolayer black phosphorus (1.8a02/photon)93 and N- or B-doped graphene
(2.2a02/photon).94 Overall, the anisotropy of the photoresponse
in the x and z directions is not
obvious in the case of X = S, while it is evident when X = Se. The z direction gives a stronger photoresponse than the x direction in SiE/MSe2. The response properties
are enhanced when SiE/MS2 changed to SiE/MSe2 (M = Mo, W). The SiE/WSe2 exhibits the strongest photoresponse
when compared with other three heterostructures, SiE/MoS2, SiE/MoSe2, and SiE/WS2.

Different photoresponse
mechanisms are found between SiE/MS2 and SiE/MSe2 (M = Mo, W) by analyzing the band structures and PDOS as shown in Figures 3 and 4. It can be seen that the valence and conduction bands of
the SiE/MSe2 (M = Mo, W) nanocomposites are both dominated
by SiE. Thus, these heterostructures show type-I band alignment. The
photoinduced electron transfer mainly occurs within the SiE planes.
In contrast, SiE/MS2 (M = Mo, W) shows type-II band alignment,
where the valence band comes from SiE and the conduction band from
MS2 (M = Mo, W), clearly indicating the possibility of
a charge separation between the SiE and MS2 (M = Mo, W)
layers. So, the photoinduced electron transfer could be expected from
SiE donors to noncovalently bound MS2 (M = Mo, W) acceptors.
Therefore, SiE/MSe2 (M = Mo, W) shows a stronger photoresponse
than SiE/MS2 (M = Mo, W).

According to convention,
for solar energy conversion, the type-II band alignment between the
complexes is a required condition.95
In this regard, SiE/MS2 (M = Mo, W) heterostructures are
good candidates for designing solar devices. In addition, the Kohn–Sham
orbitals of the conduction and the valence band in Figures 3 and 4 clearly indicate that the valence band is localized on SiE and the
valence band is localized on MS2 (M = Mo, W). According
to the semiclassical model of Marcus electron-transfer theory,96 the electron–hole recombination rate
largely depends on the electronic coupling between the initial and
final states, which in turn depends on the overlap of the valence
band and conduction band wave functions of the composite system, the
value of which depends on the overlap densities of the valence band
and the conduction band. For SiE/MS2 (M = Mo, W), the electron
and hole wave functions are spatially well separated as shown in Figures 3 and 4, indicating that electron–hole overlap can be ignored.
Thus, a conclusion can be at least drawn, the rate of electron–hole
recombination between the SiE/MS2 (M = Mo, W) heterostructures
is quite low, and therefore suitable for designing solar cell devices.

3 Conclusions
Transport properties and photoelectric effects of four two-dimensional
(2D) silicene/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) heterostructures
have been investigated by employing DFT and NEGF methods. From the
results, it can be concluded that attaching SiE onto different MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) substrates is energetically favorable.
Importantly, the substrates could stabilize the SiE by increasing
the band gap. In particular, conductivities of SiE/MX2 (M
= Mo, W; X = S, Se) are enhanced compared with free-standing SiE and
MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se). Moreover, the conductivities
are increased with the group number of X, i.e., in the order of SiE
< SiE/MS2 < SiE/MSe2. An evident current
oscillation phenomenon is observed in the SiE/WX2 (X =
S, Se) heterostructures. Otherwise, having investigated the optical
properties of SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se), we found
that SiE/MSe2 (M = Mo, W) shows a stronger photoresponse
than SiE/MS2 (M = Mo, W). The maximum photoresponse with
a value of 9.0a02/photon was
found for SiE/WSe2.
More importantly, SiE/MS2 (M = Mo, W) heterostructures
are good candidates for the use in designing solar cells owing to
the well spatial separation of the charge carriers. In addition, an
anisotropy is observed in both transport properties and photoresponse
between the x and z directions of
the heterostructures. Their transport properties and photoresponse
correlate well with the electronic structures. This work provides
some clues for further exploring 2D SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W;
X = S, Se) heterostructures involving tailored photoelectric properties.

4 Models and Computational
Methods
The SiE was selected as the prototype host layers
by placing on four monolayer substrates of MX2 (M = Mo,
W; X = S, Se). The infinite 2D heterostructures of SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) were modeled under the periodic conditions
in the x and z axial directions
to obtain the electronic structures. For a relative comparison, supercells
with the same atom numbers are required, so the supercells of SiE/MX2 were all set by planes containing 96 Si atoms, 64 M (Mo,
W) atoms, and 128 X (S, Se) atoms (Figure 1). The lattice parameters are 22.800 Å
× 26.327 Å, 22.780 Å × 26.304 Å, 21.846 Å
× 25.227 Å, and 22.794 Å × 26.320 Å for SiE/MoS2, SiE/MoSe2, SiE/WS2, and SiE/WSe2 respectively. The heterostructures were separated by a vacuum
of 16 Å in the y direction to overlook the SiE/MX2-to-SiE/MX2 interactions. All the periodic systems
were fully optimized until the maximum absolute force was less than
0.02 eV/Å.

The two-probe devices were constructed to compute
the transport properties. In these devices, the optimized supercells
of SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) were selected as the
central scatter region sandwiched between the two Au (111)-(9 ×
5) electrodes (Figure 1). Generally, interactions between the two electrodes can be eliminated
if their separation is over a distance of 10 times the radius of the
electrode atom. The lengths of the supercell along the transport direction
are 22.8 Å in the z direction and 26.3 Å
in the x direction, much larger than 10 times of
the maximum interaction radius of Au (16.6 Å). Therefore, the
central scatter regions in the SiE/MX2 two-probe devices
are long enough to ignore the influence of electrode-to-electrode
interactions. Transport properties along the two topological structures
of the nanosheet were considered: one along the x direction, and another along the z direction (as
shown in Figure 1).
The transport current was computed by changing the applied bias voltage
in the step of 0.2 V in the range of −1.0–1.0 V.

All the computations for the electronic and transport properties
were performed using the Atomistix ToolKit (ATK) based on the combination
of DFT and NEGF methods.97−100 A generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) formalism
was applied to depict the exchange correlations between electrons.
A double-ζ basis with polarization (DZP) was adopted for all
atoms. K-point in the string Brillouin zone was set
to be 15 × 1 × 15, and 150 Ry cutoff energy was employed
to describe the periodic wave function.

To gain an insight into
the photoelectric properties of SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X =
S, Se), we irradiated the scatter region SiE/MX2 of the
abovementioned two-probe systems in the y direction
with linearly polarized light (Figure 1). The polarized angle θ was assigned to that
between the y direction and the irradiation direction.
The photocurrents were calculated under the photoenergy ranging from
0.1 to 1.0 eV. We also calculated the photocurrent varying with θ
from 0 to 180° in a photoenergy internal of 0.2 eV.

The
photocurrents of SiE/MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) were computed
using the Nanodcal package which carried out DFT within the Keldysh
nonequilibrium Green’s functions (KNEGF).101−103 Standard norm-conserving nonlocal pseudopotentials
were adopted to define the atomic cores, and a s, p, d single-ζ
plus polarization (SZP) linear combination of atomic orbital basis
set was used to expand physical quantities. The exchange–correlation
potential was treated at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
level with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE).
