The pore structures and chemical
composition features of two kinds
of tri-high coal and their char samples prepared at a 750 °C
temperature were analyzed. The results showed that the pyrolysis process
has a great influence on the pore structure and the chemical composition
of the char, and the influence is highly related to the coal ranks.
The gasification kinetics of the two chars in pure CO2 atmosphere
was also studied. The results indicated that the classical random
pore model (RPM) cannot be used to explain the gasification kinetics
throughout the char gasification. A modified RPM, considering the
inhibitory effect of ash on the gasification kinetics, was adopted
to estimate the kinetics, and the kinetic constants and the corresponding
activation energies were calculated. It was observed that it was necessary
to include the effect of ash on the variations of char structures
during the char gasification to get an accurate description of reaction
rate versus carbon conversion throughout the gasification of the tri-high
coal chars.

1 Introduction
Because of the increased
demand for power and other applications,1,2 increasing
coal consumption is needed and that has resulted in higher
CO2 emission. Therefore, the application of clean coal
technology is necessary, for example, gasification. CO2 and H2O are the most common gasification agents for coal
gasification, but the usage of H2O is limited recently.
Coal transforms to syngas (H2 + CO) via gasification using
CO2 as a gasification agent,3−5 which is one of the most
critical processes in the highly efficient technologies6−8 to enable the cleaner and more efficient use of the tri-high coals.9,10 CO2 gasification is usually divided into two steps: coal
pyrolysis and char gasification, and char gasification is the rate-determining
step in the overall coal gasification process.10 The char gasification will not only be impacted by the
properties of the parent coal, such as coal rank, particle size, ash
minerals, but also be highly improved by the char preparation conditions
and operational conditions.11−15 Meanwhile, pyrolysis, as the initial stage of coal gasification,
is closely related to the coal composition and structure, which largely
affect the char gasification characteristics. It is a complicated
process involving the cracking of organic matter in the coal, the
volatilization of low-molecular-weight pyrolysis products, the polycondensation
of cracking residues, the decomposition and combination of volatile
products during emission, and the further decomposition and repolycondensation
of the polycondensation products,16,17 which would
affect the composition and structure of the char. The char composition
and structure are directly related to the char reactivity.18,19

Understanding the kinetics of the CO2 char gasification
can help to better organize many industry processes, such as the conventional
coal gasification and the integrated gasification combustion cycle.
Thus, experimentally the CO2 gasification mechanisms have
been paid recent attention,20−22 and their regular empirical reaction
models were addressed, such as, for example, the volumetric model,23 the hybrid model,24 and the random pore model (RPM).25,26 The RPM seemed
to be the most practical one, addressing the growth and coalescence
of the char structure during the char gasification. However, because
of the effect of the inherent ash in coals on the reactions occurring
during CO2 gasification, such as the formation of volatiles
and tars and their subsequent pyrolysis reactions,21 and the variations of char porous structures and graph
crystallites during the char gasification, it is difficult to explain
the gasification reaction rate throughout the char gasification by
the classical RPM.27,28

Tri-high coal, characterized
by high-ash content, high-sulfur content,
and high-ash fusion, is the most representative coal type in southwest
China. Thus, the CO2 gasification of two kinds of tri-high
coal chars from Guizhou, China, in isothermal conditions was investigated
kinetically by analyzing thermogravimetric data in this paper. A modified
RPM, considering the inhibitory effect of ash on the gasification,
was adopted to determine the kinetic constants and the corresponding
activation energies, and the effect of composite and structure of
coal char on the gasification was also considered.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure Characteristics
2.1.1 Morphology of Samples
The scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the selected samples are shown
in Figure 1; it clearly
revealed sizes, surface roughness and smoothness, irregularities in
shape, and structures of visible surface pores of the selected samples.
The surface of the raw coals particles was roughness with some lamellar
structure features, and the pore structure was rarely. After pyrolysis,
the surface of coals’ char particles became smooth, and the
lamellar structure shrank and decreased. Figure 1 also shows that the char I surface showed
a porosity development obviously, and the char I particles became
coarse with some small embossed features, which were identified to
be the parts of a small surface bulge on the char surface. However,
it had not yet found more pore structure produced of the char II particles,
probably because the agglomeration of the ash on the surface of the
coal particles led to the smooth surface, which was not conducive
to the growth of pore structures.

2.1.2 N2 Adsorption–Desorption
Isotherm Characteristics
Measurements of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface area and total pore volume of the selected
samples are presented in Table 1. It can be found that the surface area of char I increased
after pyrolysis, the raw coal I was 20.37 m2/g, the char
I was 31.21 m2/g. This may be because of some of the pore
growth and new pore formation, resulting in increase in char surface
area during the pyrolysis process, and a similar trend was also observed
in pore volumes of raw coal and char. The surface area and pore volume
of char II decreased after pyrolysis, it could be because there was
no pore growth and new pore formation, but aggregation of ash on the
surface of raw coal during the pyrolysis process. These results were
consistent with results from SEM images.

total pore volume (mL/g)	0.044	0.083	0.030	0.020	
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
of the selected
samples are shown in Figure 2. According to the IUPAC classification, there are six different
types of isotherms adsorption–desorption curves.29 The adsorption–desorption curves of raw
coal I almost coincided, indicating that only a small number of pores
exist. After pyrolysis, the adsorption–desorption curve of
char I did not form a closed hysteresis loop, which may be because
of the existence of only micropores. The isothermal adsorption–desorption
curves of raw coal II and char II were similar to type III, but no
closed hysteresis loop was formed. Moreover, when P/P0 exceeded 0.4, both of the adsorption–desorption
curves showed a large unclosed hysteresis loop, which indicated that
micropores and mesopores coexisted in raw coal II and its char.29Figure 2a also shows that when the P/P0 exceeded 0.4, the isothermal adsorption–desorption
curves of raw coal II showed a weak hysteresis loop; after pyrolysis,
the hysteresis loop of char II became larger, indicating that the
porosity of particles increased after pyrolysis. These results are
consistent with results from SEM analysis (Figure 1).

Figure 4 XRD patterns of coal I and char I (a), coal II and char

For the pore size distribution
characteristics of selected samples
(Figure 3), the pore
structure of raw coal I sample mainly consisted of mesopores within
the range of 2–5 nm, and the pore structure of char I mainly
consisted of micropores and some mesopores within the range of 2–7
nm. These results indicated that pyrolysis is favorable to the formation
of the micropores and the development of mesopores of coal I. However,
the pyrolysis process has little effect on pore size distribution
of coal II, and the pore structure of raw coal I and its char particles
mainly consisted of micropores with pore size of less than 2 nm and
small mesopores within the range of 3–5 nm.

2.1.3 X-ray Diffraction Pattern Analysis
Figure 4 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the raw coal and the prepared
char samples. Both the coal samples contain above 20% ash according
to the proximate analysis of coal; thus, it can be seen that some
minerals exist from the XRD patterns. The presence of a clear (002)
band at ∼26° and (100) band in the neighborhood of the
graphite at ∼43°30 indicated
that the samples contained some graphite-like structures (crystalline
carbon), shown in Figure 5, which suggested that the crystallites in the samples had
intermediate structures between graphite and the amorphous state.
The presence of the clear asymmetric (002) band around 26° suggested
the existence of another band (γ) on its left-hand side, which
was attached to the periphery of carbon crystallites.31,32 The 002 and 100 peaks of both of char I and char II were wider than
those of their coal samples, which indicated that the pyrolysis process
was favorablet to the vertical stacking ofhe microcrystalline structure
and the increasing of size of the carbon network plane. However, after
pyrolysis, the γ peaks in char I experienced limited change,
which indicated that the aliphatic side chains of coal I did not crack
at such pyrolysis temperature. Compared with coal II and its char,
it can be seen that aliphatic side chains and other unstable macromolecule
groups crack to form low-molecular-weight groups, and volatilize,
narrowing down the γ peaks in char II. In addition, the aromatic
layers were too thin to be detected, which resulted in no 100 peak
being found in both coal II and its char.

vs gasification time, in response
to variation of the temperatures.

2.2 Kinetic Analysis
Figure 5 shows the carbon conversions
versus gasification time char at different temperatures (950–1200
°C). The results showed that the effects of temperature on the
char gasification are pretty straightforward; the elevation of gasification
temperature generally resulted in increasing carbon conversion efficiency.
The increase of temperature led to the increase of the carbon conversion
throughout the char gasification process.

Figure 6 shows the reaction rate versus carbon conversion
at different temperatures, obtained via experiments (symbols), modeling
by the RPM (dot lines). It showed that the reaction rate portrayed
a gradual rise till a maximum located in the carbon conversion at
around 0.2 and then went down steadily during the char gasification.
In our previous work,10 we studied the
derivations and variations of char structures throughout the char
gasification process. The results indicated that both the porous structure
and carbon crystallites would affect the char CO2 gasification
kinetics; the slower gasification rates might be explained by collapsing
the pore structure and/or the slow transfer of CO2 to new
carbon sites, which required a certain degree of mobility.10,23

Figure 6 Profiles
of reaction rate vs carbon conversion obtained at different
temperatures. Symbols, experimental data; solid lines, fitting results
by the RPM.

Figure 6 also shows
that the RPM was not able to capture the salient features of the experimental
reaction rate versus carbon conversion curves throughout the gasification
process in the whole range of temperature values. The rate constant k and the structural parameter ψ in the RPM for all
experiments are reported in Table 2. As expected, rate constant k increased
with increasing temperature. However, the structural parameter ψ
for the RPM cannot be accurately estimated; its value sometimes approached
zero during the parameter estimation, and the second term in the RPM
equation (eq 3) was always
1, collapsing this model to the volumetric model, which was consistent
with published studies.23,33 It was because the
ash content of the selected coal was as high as above 20%, which had
a great influence on the char preparation process and gasification
process, and led to the variations of char structures, failing to
follow the RPM during the char gasification process, especially, in
the postreaction stage.27,28

Better
results are obtained when the mRPM in the reaction-controlled
regime is adopted, the agreement between the observed values and the
mRPM calculated data is very good, as shown in Figure 7, and most of the R2 values were very high (>0.9), as shown in Table 3. It can be found that the rate
constant k also increased with increasing temperature,
and the calculated values of structural parameter ψ for gasification
of char I were between 4.84 and 62.85, whereas the ψ for gasification
of char II was between 10.40 and 29.58. These results indicated that
the mRPM including the ash layer resistance (dot lines) was able to
improve the prediction capability of the classical reaction-controlled
RPM (solid line) and to fit well experimental data also for high values
of the conversion, in the whole range of temperature and for both
of the two kinds of tri-high coal char with high ash (see Figure 7 and Table 3).

The Arrhenius regression model (ki = k0 exp(−Ea/RT) was applied to determine
the activation energy
(Ea) and pre-exponential factor (k0)n reaction rate. The analyzed Figure 8 shows the curves
of the linear regression of gasificatiovalues of kinetics parameters,
summarized in Table 4. Specifically, Ea = 258.69 kJ/mol for
gasification kinetics of char I modeling by the mRPM, and Ea = 235.90 kJ/mol for char II.

ln k0	16.27	13.76

The obtained Ea of char I is lower
than that of char II, indicating that the gasification reaction of
char II requires lesser energy than char I and the activity of the
carbon matrix of char II is higher than that of char I, which is consistent
with the result of XRD. However, char I displays a higher pre-exponential
factor (k0) than that of char II, revealing
that a higher gasification rate is attained in the gasification process.
Moreover, the BET and SEM results show that char I has more pore structure
than char II. These results indicate that the reaction rate of char
gasification is a result of the combination of composite and structure
of char, and pore structure plays a major role.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, the surface areas, pore structures,
and carbon crystalline
features of two kinds of coal and their char samples prepared at a
750 °C temperature were analyzed. A classical RPM and a modified
RPM (mRPM) were also applied. The BET and SEM results showed the pyrolysis
process is favorable to the development of the pore structures of
char I, but not for char II. The XRD results showed that the aliphatic
side chains of coal I did not crack at 950 °C during pyrolysis,
but the aliphatic side chains of coal I did.

The mRPM is able
to capture all the salient features of the reaction
rate versus carbon conversion for both kinds of tri-high coal char
samples throughout the char gasification in the whole range of temperatures.

The value of the estimated activation energies by the mRPM of char
I was 258.69 kJ/mol, which is higher than that of char II, 235.90
kJ/mol. In combination of the results of BET, SEM, and XRD, gasification
reactivity is the result of the interaction of pore structure and
the chemical composition of the chars.

Section
4.1 Materials
The proximate and ultimate
analysis of the two coals used in this paper is summarized in Table 5, and named coal I
and coal II, respectively. The volatile contents of the two coals
are low, accounting for around 10%; the ash content of the two coals
are high, exceeding 20%, and the carbon contents are also very high,
exceeding 85%. In this paper, the coal samples were ground and sieved
to 100–250 μm. Char preparation was carried out at 950
°C under a nitrogen atmosphere in a fixed bed reactor, and the
char CO2 gasification was carried out in a thermogravimetric
analyzer at 950–1200 °C. In the char gasification process,
10 ± 0.5 mg of coal char was placed in a crucible boat, and then
heated at 20 K/min to the design temperatures under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Thereafter, the gas was switched to CO2 and the gasification
process was allowed to proceed. Finally, the samples were held isothermal
for 90 min. The combined gas flow rates of N2 and CO2 were 50 mL/min.

4.2 Char Characterizations
4.2.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy
The
SEM experiments were conducted on a FEI Company Nova Nano SEM 450
and the microscope was operated between 5 and 25 kV. To prepare the
samples for examination, silver paste was applied to an SEM stub,
and the samples were sprinkled onto the paste.

4.2.2 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
The BET specific
surface areas and pore volumes of char samples were
obtained using the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
at 77 K by an ASAP 2020 apparatus. Prior to the analysis, the char
samples were degassed at 200 °C for 3 h. The specific surface
area was calculated using the BET method. The total pore volume, Vt, was determined as the volume of nitrogen
adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0.99. The micropore volume was
obtained by applying the t-Plot method. The mesopore
volume was obtained by subtraction of the volume of nitrogen adsorbed
at a relative pressure of 0.10 from the volume of nitrogen adsorbed
at a relative pressure of 0.95.34 The density
functional theory method was used to interpret the data related to
the pore size distribution.35

4.2.3 X-Ray Diffraction
XRD curves of
the samples were obtained in the UItima IV XRD using the Cu KR radiation
(λ = 0.1542 nm). The spectra were recorded in the 2θ range
of 10°–90° with a scanning speed of 2° min–1. The XRD data were smoothed and processed by PeakFit4.2
according to Zhang et al.,31 and the crystallite
structures of the samples such as the horizontal dimension of the
aromatic microcrystal (La), the vertical
dimension (Lc), and the average distance
between the polyaromatic layers (d002)
were calculated by Bragg’s law and Scherrer equation.36

4.3 Kinetic Modeling
The carbon conversion
degree (x) of char defined as the mass ratio of the
gasified char at any time to the initial char mass can be expressed
as follows. 1  

Reaction rate (r)
was calculated from mass ratio versus time profiles using eq 2. 2  where w0 is the
initial mass of char, wt is the instantaneous char mass at reaction time t, and wash is the mass of ash.

The RPM37,38 was used to estimate the CO2 gasification
kinetics, which was valid to summarize together
with derivations and development of the pore structure of the char
for the evaluation of char gasification kinetics.

The overall
reaction rate was 3  where k is the reaction
rate
constant. 4  Here, Ea—activation
energy, k0—pre-exponential factor.

ψ is a parameter related to the pore structure of the initial
char structure. 5  where S0—initial
surface area; L0—the total pore
length per unit volume; ε0—the initial porosity.

However, the inherent high ash in coal in the tri-high coal would
have a great influence on the char gasification process, which would
lead the variations of char structures, failing to follow the RPM
during the char gasification process, especially in the postreaction
stage.27,28 It could result in the following: (1) the
fitting degree between the experiment and modeling data is poor; and
(2) the structural parameter ψ for the RPM cannot be accurately
estimated; its value approached zero (lower boundary) during the parameter
estimation, and the second term in the RPM equation was always 1,
collapsing this model to the volumetric model.23,33

During the gasification, the inner and outer surfaces of coal
char
pores will accumulate ash, which have a non-negligible inhibitory
effect on the gasification process, and the effect of the ash on the
process is related to the carbon conversion. Thus, in this paper,
the RPM was modified by introducing an empirical formula G(x), which is used to characterize the inhibitory
effect of ash, to better fit the experimental data obtained by gasification
of the tri-high coal char with high ash by CO2. 6  where m is a constant to
characterize inhibition.

The modified RPM (mRPM) is shown as
follows 7  

If we defined n = m + 1, we can
get. 8
