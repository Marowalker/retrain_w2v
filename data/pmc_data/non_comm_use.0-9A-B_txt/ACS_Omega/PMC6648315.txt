Irradiation of ammonia dispersed
in solid neon near 4 K with tunable
far-ultraviolet light from a synchrotron yielded amidogen, NH2, and imidogen, NH, radicals as products. The electronic absorption
spectra of amidogen radicals in isotopic variants NH2,
NHD, and ND2 were recorded in the visible and near-ultraviolet
regions after photolysis of NH3 and ND3. The
infrared absorption lines of NH2 associated with vibration-rotational
levels of vibrational modes ν1 at 3234.3 (00,0–10,1), 3244.9 (00,0–11,1), and 3249.3 cm–1 (00,0–11,0), and ν2 at 1498.7 (10,1–11,1), 1509.5 (11,0–10,1), 1516.5
(00,0–10,1), 1528.6 (00,0–11,1), and 1533.7 cm–1 (00,0–11,0) were unambiguously identified according to the results
of experiments with deuterium isotopes. The 00,0–00,0 lines of ν1 and ν2 for
NH2 were derived to be at 3213.5 and 1494.6 cm–1 in solid neon.

Introduction
Ammonia, NH3, has been observed in many astronomical
environments, such as in the direction of the galactic center,1 in comet 1983D,2 in
the Large Magellanic Cloud, and in nearby galaxies IC 342,3 NGC 6946, and NGC 2146.4 In our solar system, NH3 exists in the atmosphere of
Jupiter;5 ethyne-ammonia co-crystal was
suggested to exist on Titan.6 NH3 is hence believed to be present also in the form of ice in non-negligible
proportions in cold outer space. A bombardment with energetic radiation
of gaseous and icy ammonia is a possible route for the evolution of
nitrogen species in the cosmos; the amidogen radical NH2 is a key species in the degradation of ammonia.7−12 The identification of NH2 is thus crucial for an understanding
of the conversion of nitrogen in cold astronomical environments.13−16

The NH2 radical exhibits a complicated electronic
spectrum
with a vibrational and rotational structure in the visible and ultraviolet
regions that has been well characterized in both gaseous and solid
phases.7,17−22 NH2 in its electronic ground state has a bent molecular
conformation with three vibrational modes ν1, ν2, and ν3 associated with symmetric stretching,
angular deformation, and antisymmetric stretching motions, respectively.
In the gaseous phase, the wavenumbers of NH2 are reported
to be for modes ν1 3219.4 cm–1,
ν2 1497.3 cm–1, and ν3 3301.1 cm–1.18,23−27

The vibrational lines of NH2 radicals in solid
environments
have been studied previously.28−31 Milligan and Jacox recorded the vibrational lines
of NH2 in solid nitrogen, argon, and carbon monoxide at
14 K;28 they observed spectral features
at 1499 and 3220 cm–1 that were assigned to ν2 and ν1, respectively, of NH2 in
solid nitrogen. Subsequently, Suzer and Andrews29 bombarded dilute gaseous mixtures of NH3 and
Ar, ratio 1:500, with thermionic electrons from a tungsten filament
biased at 20–100 V and deposited the products on a CsI window
to which was attached an electron-attracting ring biased at 50–100
V near 10 K; they recorded new lines in solid argon at 3217, 3152,
3133, and 3127 cm–1 in the region of the N–H
stretching modes and at 1523 and 1496 cm–1 in the
region of angular deformation. On the basis of previous work,28 Suzer and Andrews assigned the lines at 3217
and 1496 cm–1 to vibrational modes ν1 and ν2, respectively, for the NH2 radical
and a doublet at 3133 and 3127 cm–1 to the NH radical
in solid argon; the lines at 3152 and 1523 cm–1 were
associated with vibrational modes ν3 and ν2, respectively, of the NH2– ion
in solid argon, but their line recorded at 1523 cm–1 in solid argon is the same as the value of Milligan and Jacox. Recently,
Krim’s group studied the IR lines of NH2 and their
complexes in solid neon;30,31 they assigned the lines
at 1501.1, 1516.5, 1529.6, and 1487.1 cm–1 due to
NH2, and (NH2)(NH3), (NH2)(NH3)2, and (NH2)(NH3)n complexes.

To better understand
the matrix shift of the NH2, we
performed experiments with the precursor ammonia dispersed at great
dilution in solid neon with far-ultraviolet radiation for excitation
in the present work; based on a careful study, we have unambiguously
identified the infrared absorption lines of isolated amidogen radicals
in solid neon.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 presents
infrared absorption spectra of ammonia precursors dispersed in solid
neon over the recorded range 600–3550 cm–1. Figure 1a,b displays
the spectra from a gaseous sample of proportion NH3/Ne
= 1:10 000 after deposition for 14.5 h and from the gaseous
sample with ND3/Ne = 1:1000 after deposition for 2 h near
4 K. The infrared absorption spectra of ammonia dispersed in solid
noble gases have been well documented previously. In this work, we
recorded 32 absorption lines from our NH3/Ne = 1:10 000
sample near 4 K in the region 600–3550 cm–1; based on previous work, these lines are assignable to the rotational
fine structure associated with vibrational modes of NH3, as listed in Tables S1–S3 (see the Supporting Information). To simplify the presentation, we mark only the
vibrational modes of ammonia in Figure 1. For the deuterated sample, we initially diluted gaseous
ND3 in Ne at the molar ratio 1:1000 and 295 K; after the
gases in a cylinder had become mixed over 3 days, we deposited this
gaseous mixture on a cold target at 4 K. Figure 1b shows a complicated spectrum of this precursor
sample; on detailed examination, we identified various vibration-rotational
lines associated with all isotopic species NH3, NH2D, NHD2, and ND3, as listed in Tables
S4–S10 (see the Supporting Information). This result indicates that gaseous ND3 readily exchanged
D with H sources on the surfaces of the cylinder, gas lines, or chamber
in our experimental system. According to the intensities of their
characteristic infrared lines, the ratio NH3/NH2D/NHD2/ND3 was roughly 2.0:2.2:1.8:1.0 for
this sample of deuterated ammonia after deposition as a precursor
in neon near 4 K.

neon
near 4 K; (a) for NH3 dispersed in solid neon, 1:10 000;
(b) for original sample ND3 dispersed in solid neon, 1:1000.

The energy of a NH bond in NH3 is about 4.40 eV, which
corresponds to a dissociation threshold at wavelength 282 nm. The
primary dissociation from this target is represented as 1  

The quantum yield of reaction 1 was reported
near unity at 206.2 and 184.9 nm.32,33 For the formation
of NH2 from NH3, we thus assume that reaction 1 is a favorable route upon irradiation with light
of wavelength 200 nm or less.

Figure 2 displays
the visible absorption spectrum from NH3 dispersed in solid
neon (1:1000) near 4 K after photolysis at 200 nm for 76.6 min. According
to eq 1, the primary
photochemical products from NH3 are the H atom and NH2 radical;17 absorption lines due
to NH2 are consequently expected after the photolysis of
NH3. The major signals in this absorption spectrum after
irradiation at 200 nm are thus assigned to lines of transition X̃ 2B1 → Ã 2A1 for
NH2 radicals.17 The spectra
of amidogen radicals in solid dispersions of noble gases are explored
at length elsewhere.21 The spectra of NH
radicals in solid dispersions of noble gases other than Ne are likewise
discussed elsewhere.19 After irradiation
at 200 nm as shown in Figure 2, we recorded the π system of lines from (0,0,0)–(0,1+,0) to (0,0,0)–(0,9+,0) at 785.9, 691.6,
624.5, 565.6, 512.2, 467.8, 429.3, 396.2, and 367.1 nm, (0,0,0)–(1,2+,0) to (0,0,0)–(1,4+,0) at 559.2, 516.2
and 475.6 nm, (0,0,0)–(0,10–,0) to (0,0,0)–(0,12–,0) at 762.2, 712.0 and 643.2 nm, (0,0,0)–(1,7–,0) and (0,0,0)–(1,8–,0) at
772.8 and 703.3 nm, and (0,0,0)–(1,10–,0)
at 607.7 nm; v′–v″ denotes vibrational numbering
for transitions between the vibrational ground state v″ = 0
of the ground electronic state and vibrational state v′ in
a higher electronic state. These assigned lines are listed in Table 1.

The photolytic yield
of NH2 from NH3 might
depend on the wavelength of excitation. Figure 3a displays the absorption spectrum in the
wavelength range 350–820 nm from NH3 dispersed in
solid neon (1:1000) near 4 K after photolysis at 173 nm for 76.6 min.
The lines of the NH2 radical in the π system upon
irradiation of NH3 at 173 nm were observed to have intensities
six times those upon irradiation at 200 nm for the same duration.
Other than the π system of the NH2 radical, we identified
lines for the weak σ and δ systems of the NH2 radical: the σ system of lines included from (0,0,0)–(0,4+,0) to (0,0,0)–(0,7+,0) at 591.3, 535.3,
486.9, and 445.5 nm and (0,0,0)–(1,2+,0) to (0,0,0)–(1,4+,0) at 582.7, 530.9, and 491.0 nm; the δ system from
(0,0,0)–(0,3+,0) to (0,0,0)–(1,3+,0) at 600.0, 550.1, and 507.1 nm was also observed clearly.

spectra in the wavelength range 350–825 nm for
ammonia dispersed in Ne (1:1000) near 4 K after photolysis at 173
nm for 76.6 min; (a) from NH3/Ne (1:1000); (b) from original
sample ND3/Ne (1:1000).

Amidogen radicals are reported to execute nearly free rotation
in their electronically excited states in solid noble gases near 4
K.21,34 Although our spectral resolution is insufficient
to resolve fully the rotational structure in the visible and near-ultraviolet
regions, the pattern of the absorption profile for our samples is
consistent with this rotational motion in dispersions in solid neon.
To confirm the observation of amidogen radicals, Figure 3b displays the absorption spectrum
in the wavelength region 320–825 nm from a sample containing
ND3 dispersed in solid neon (1:1000) near 4 K after photolysis
at 173 nm for 76.6 min. As discussed above, this sample contains isotopic
variants NH3, NH2D, NHD2, and ND3; the photolysis products thus formed comprised NH2, NHD, and ND2 radicals; assignments of their lines are
listed in Table 1.

In all absorption spectra in the visible and near-ultraviolet regions
after irradiation at 200 and 173 nm, we also recorded a prominent
line near 335 nm, assigned to NH or ND.19,21 This result
indicates that product NH2 is subject to photolysis to
the NH radical in this photochemical system as 2  

From the visible and near-infrared absorption spectra, we thus
confirmed that the primary product from NH3 upon far-ultraviolet
radiation is amidogen radicals with the byproduct NH radical. For
the analysis of the infrared absorption, Figure 4 shows selected portions of difference infrared-absorption
spectra for ammonia dispersed in solid neon near 4 K excited with
far-ultraviolet radiation. We recorded these spectra of the deposited
solid samples before photolysis, as shown in Figure 1, and after photolysis with radiation at
a selected wavelength; the latter spectra after the irradiation were
subtracted from the original spectrum to become the difference spectra.
In these spectra, lines pointing upward from the baseline are associated
with photolysis products; lines pointing downward are due to the depletion
of precursors present before photolysis. On irradiation of ammonia
dispersed in solid neon near 4 K with light of wavelength 200 nm or
less, the intensity of all infrared absorption lines of ammonia in
all samples uniformly and continuously decreased, but at a rate decreasing
with increasing duration of irradiation. Figure 4a depicts a difference infrared-absorption
spectrum from NH3 dispersed at 1:1000 in solid neon near
4 K after photolysis at 173 nm for total duration 76.7 min. We observed
several new lines that were hence due to photolysis products. We annealed
the irradiated samples to about 9 K and observed that these new lines
disappeared. The results indicate that the carriers of these new lines
are transient species. On the basis of the discussion above, the new
lines recorded in Figure 4a might be associated with NH and NH2 radicals.
A line associated with the pure vibrational transition of NH was assigned35,36 at wavenumbers 3133 cm–1 in Ar37,38 and 3126.17 cm–1 for the gaseous phase39 which were reported previously. In Figure 4a, a weak doublet
was observed at 3129.0 and 3135.5 cm–1, which are
thus assigned to the pure vibrational transition of NH in Ne; this
doublet might be due to the two sites of the NH radical in solid neon,
or one line is from NH and another one may be associated to the NH···H2 complex. In the gaseous phase, the pure rotational transition
of NH is 32.51 cm–1; another doublet recorded at
3166.1 and 3170.2 cm–1 is hence associated with
the vibration-rotational lines of NH.

solid neon near 4 K after photolysis at 173 nm for total duration
76.7 min; (a) for NH3 dispersed in solid neon, 1:1000;
(b) for the original sample ND3 dispersed in solid neon,
1:1000. Δabsorbance denotes the difference of absorbance, log10(I0/I).

Other than the weak line of NH
in Figure 4a, a distinct
positive multiplex at 1498.7,
1509.5, 1516.5, 1528.6, and 1533.7 cm–1 appeared
with another weak multiplex at 3234.3, 3244.9, and 3249.3 cm–1. The variation of their relative intensities according to the varied
wavelength of excitation and their curves of growth enabled their
assignment to the same carrier; according to Figures 2 and 3, the most likely
candidate is thus the NH2 radical. Relative to pure vibrational
modes ν1 at 3219.4, ν2 at 1497.3,
and ν3 at 3301.1 cm–1 of the NH2 radical in the gaseous phase,18,23−27 we thus assigned the lines at 3234.3, 3244.9, and 3249.3 cm–1 to ν1 and 1498.7, 1509.5, 1516.5,
1528.6, and 1533.7 cm–1 to ν2 for
NH2 in solid neon, as listed in Table 2. The difference infrared-absorption spectrum
from the original sample of ND3 dispersed in solid neon
(1:1000) near 4 K after photolysis for total duration 76.7 min upon
excitation at 173 nm is shown in Figure 4b. As mentioned above, this precursor sample
contained NH3, NH2D, NHD2, and ND3 in a ratio about 2.0:2.2:1.8:1.0; as a result, the amidogen
radicals as photolysis products would comprise isotopic species NH2, NHD, and ND2. Beyond the lines of NH2, the further new lines observed might be associated with NHD and
ND2 radicals. Considering the reasonable isotopic shifts,
we thus assigned the vibrational mode ν2 at 1109.6,
1110.8, 1115.2, 1118.1, and 1125.8 cm–1 of ND2, whereas the lines associated with mode ν2 of the NHD radical were recorded at 1326.1, 1329.6, 1333.6, and
1343.4 cm–1, as listed in Table 2. The lines of the ν1 modes
for NHD and ND2 radicals might be too weak to be observable
in these experiments.

The infrared
spectra of amidogen radicals in solid matrices were
first studied by Milligan and Jacox;28 they
produced the radicals from the dissociation of ammonia dispersed in
solid CO, N2, and Ar at 14 K with molar ratios in the range
of 100 to 600 following vacuum-ultraviolet photolysis with microwave-powered
hydrogen and xenon lamps. Milligan and Jacox observed spectral features
at 1499 and 3220 cm–1 that were assigned to ν2 and ν1, respectively, of NH2 in
solid nitrogen. Near the ν2 region of NH2, they also recorded a doublet at 1495 and 1498 cm–1 with approximately equal intensities and a broad feature at 1523
cm–1 having about the same peak intensity in solid
argon at 14 K; their result indicates that NH2 might freely
rotate in this environment. The complicate pattern near the region
of mode ν2 of NH2 in the argon matrix
observed by Milligan and Jacox is similar to ours in solid neon.

Krim’s group also used vacuum-ultraviolet light from a hydrogen
or deuterium lamp to irradiate a dilute gaseous mixture of ammonia
and neon before deposition of the products as a solid sample near
4 K; their recorded lines at 1501.1, 1516.5, 1529.6, and 1487.1 cm–1 were attributed to NH2 and (NH2)(NH3), (NH2)(NH3)2,
and (NH2)(NH3)n complexes;30,31 their recorded lines at 1501.1, 1516.5, and 1529.6 cm–1 coincide with our multiplex of ν2 for NH2 at 1498.7, 1516.5, and 1528.6 cm–1 in solid neon.

As discussed above, we wonder whether the previously recorded lines
at 1523 cm–1 in solid nitrogen28 and argon29 and the lines at
1501.1, 1516.5, and 1529.6 cm–1 in solid neon30,31 might be associated with a NH2 complex rather than with
ν2 of NH2. To verify this point, we performed
further experiments with a sample at molar ratio 1:10 000; Figure 1a shows the absorption
spectrum of this precursor sample. Jacox and Thompson reported absorption
lines of (NH3)2 at 1019.4 and (NH3)n at 998.5 cm–1,37 but no such line was observed for our sample
with NH3/Ne = 1:10 000, as exhibited in Figure 1a and listed in Table
S3 of Supporting Information. This result
indicates the absence of complexes such as (NH3)2 and (NH3)n in our highly
dilute sample with NH3/Ne = 1:10 000; it was accordingly
impossible to produce (NH2)(NH3), (NH2)(NH3)2, and (NH2)(NH3)n complexes after photolysis of this
highly dilute precursor. Figure 5 displays a partial difference infrared-absorption
spectrum for NH3 dispersed at 1:10 000 in solid
neon near 4 K upon excitation at 165 nm for a total duration of 76.7
min. We recorded the doublet at 3129.0 and 3135.5 cm–1 for NH and its vibration rotational lines at 3166.1 and 3170.2 cm–1; in addition, the multiplexes at 3234.3, 3244.9,
and 3249.3 cm–1 of ν1 and at 1516.5,
1528.6, and 1533.7 cm–1 of ν2 for
NH2 in solid neon were observed in such a dilute sample
as shown in Figure 5. These observations confirm our assignment of amidogen radicals
in this work.

Figure 5 Difference infrared-absorption spectrum of NH3 dispersed
in solid neon, 1:10 000, after photolysis at 165 nm for a total
duration of 76.7 min near 4 K. Δabsorbance denotes the difference
of absorbance, log10(I0/I).

The multiplex at 1498.7,
1509.5, 1516.5, 1528.6, and 1533.7 cm–1 is assigned
to ν2 of NH2 in solid neon. As suggested
by Jacox and Milligan, the NH2 radicals might rotate freely
in solid argon; it might hence also
possess a rotational pattern in solid neon. The theoretical rovibronic
levels of NH2 were calculated with highly correlated methods
by Gabriel et al.,39 also listed in Table 2. The lines at 1498.7,
1509.5, 1516.5, 1528.6, and 1533.7 cm–1 can accordingly
be assigned to lines of rotational transitions 10,1–11,1, 11,0–10,1, 00,0–10,1, 00,0–11,1,
and 00,0–11,0, respectively, for the
ν2 rotational transitions of NH2 in solid
neon. Similarly, we can assign the multiplex at 3234.3, 3244.9, and
3249.3 cm–1 to rotational lines 00,0–10,1, 00,0–11,1, and 00,0–11,0, respectively, of NH2 in the ν1 mode. Unfortunately, the lines of ν1 of
NH2 are near the depletion lines of the precursor; as a
result, the pattern of the ν1 lines might be thus
strongly perturbed. The differences between the experimental and calculated
values are in the range 3.24–4.08 cm–1; the
agreement is satisfactory. Among the ν2 rotational
transitions of NH2, the most intense line is for 00,0–11,1 at 1528.6 cm–1 in solid neon; this phenomenon is similar to that of H2O in solid neon.40 The 00,0–00,0 line for ν2 of H2O is too weak to be observed; the analogous line of NH2 is unobservable. The term values of Ae, Be, and Ce of NH2 are 23.8470, 12.8585, and 8.3540 cm–1,39 respectively; based on these values,
we thus derived the 00,0–00,0 lines of
ν1 and ν2 for NH2 to
be at 3213.5 and 1494.6 cm–1, which are near the
theoretical values 3215.94 and 1498.68 cm–1.39 All these results further support our assignments.
Compared to the gaseous values, the 00,0–00,0 lines of ν1 and ν2 for NH2 have red shifts 5.9 and 2.7 cm–1, respectively,
in solid neon. The shifts are less than 0.2%, which is reasonable
in solid neon.

Conclusions
We irradiated ammonia
dispersed in solid neon near 4 K with tunable
far-ultraviolet light from a synchrotron and produced photolysis products
imidogen and amidogen as trapped radicals. After photolysis of NH3 and ND3 in solid neon, features of the electronic
absorption spectra of isotopic variants NH2, NHD, and ND2 radicals were recorded in the visible and near-ultraviolet
region, similarly to those previously reported. This result demonstrates
that amidogen radicals were formed as a primary product from ammonia
upon far-ultraviolet radiation in solid neon. Apart from the doublet
at 3129.0 and 3135.5 cm–1 for NH and its vibration-rotational
lines at 3166.1 and 3170.2 cm–1, we recorded infrared
absorption lines at 1498.7, 1509.5, 1516.5, 1528.6, 1533.7, 3234.3,
3244.9, and 3249.3 cm–1 after far-ultraviolet photolysis
of NH3 dispersed in solid neon; those lines are thus associated
with the NH2 radical. After an examination of all evidence,
we thus unambiguously assigned the vibration-rotational lines of NH2 at 3234.3 (00,0–10,1), 3244.9
(00,0–11,1), and 3249.3 cm–1 (00,0–11,0) to mode ν1, at 1498.7 (10,1–11,1), 1509.5 (11,0–10,1), 1516.5 (00,0–10,1), 1528.6 (00,0–11,1), and
1533.7 cm–1 (00,0–11,0) to mode ν2, consistent with results for D-isotopic
experiments. We also derived the 00,0–00,0 lines of ν1 and ν2 for NH2 to be at 3213.5 and 1494.6 cm–1 in solid
neon.

Experiments
Our apparatus for photochemical experiments
on solid samples is
described elsewhere.41−43 The radiation for photolysis at 200, 173, 165, or
143 nm was selected from an undulator on beam line BL21A2 of Taiwan
Light Source at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center; after
absorption with a gaseous and a crystalline filter to suppress harmonics
from the undulator, the selected far-ultraviolet light delivered about
∼1015 photons s–1 (bandwidth 2%)
to our samples.

Gaseous mixtures of ammonia dispersed in neon
at designed proportions
were deposited at flow rate 0.016 mol/h for 2–14.5 h on a KBr
window cooled with a closed-cycle refrigerator (Janis RDK-415) to
∼4 K within an enclosure evacuated to <4 μPa. During
irradiation with far-ultraviolet light from the beam line, we recorded
concurrently the near-ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared emission
in the spectral range 200–1100 nm. The emissions were dispersed
with a monochromator (iHR320) and recorded with a charge-coupled detector
(1024 × 256 pixels, Horiba Symphony II, image mode). After irradiation
for each selected period, we measured both near-ultraviolet, visible,
and near-infrared absorption spectra, 200–1100 nm, in transmission
with the same detection system and infrared absorption spectra in
transmission with an interferometric spectrometer (Bomem, DA8, KBr
beam splitter, HgCdTe detector cooled to 77 K, resolution 0.5 cm–1, range 500–5000 cm–1; the
accuracy of reported spectral positions is ±0.1 cm–1). The spectrum of a precursor before irradiation served as a basis
of the identification of photochemical effects, as indicated in difference
spectra of the sample after irradiation for various intervals relative
to the spectrum before irradiation. The sample was located in the
beam of light from the source in the infrared instrument such that
the transmitted light passed through the sample in a straight line.
The light emitted in the near-ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared
region was collected with an optical fiber and conveyed to a monochromator
and detector. For absorption spectra, the light from one or other
source, a deuterium lamp for the near-ultraviolet region or a tungsten
lamp for the visible and near-infrared region, passed through the
sample obliquely and was collected with the same optical fiber to
be conveyed to the monochromator and detector.

The chemical
substances in these experiments were NH3 (99.99%, Matheson),
ND3 (isotopic purity 99%, Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories, Inc.), and Ne (99.999%, Scott Specialty Gases).
Ne was used without purification; NH3 and ND3 were purified with a freeze–pump–thaw procedure at
77 K, followed by vacuum distillation from 206 to 77 K.
