Antimicrobial
peptides are promising molecules in uprising consequences
of drug-resistant bacteria. The prodomain of furin, a serine protease,
expressed in all vertebrates including humans, is known to be important
for physiological functions. Here, potent antimicrobial peptides were
mapped by extensive analyses of overlapping peptide fragments of the
prodomain of human furin. Two peptides, YR26 and YR23, were active
against bacterial cells including MRSA-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis 51625. Peptides were largely devoid of hemolytic and cytotoxic activity.
Bacterial cell killing occurred as a result of the disruption of the
permeability barrier of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-outer membrane
and fragmentation of LPS into small micelles. Furthermore, antibacterial
peptides specifically interacted with the negatively charged lipids
causing membrane leakage and fusion. The YR26 peptide in sodium dodecyl
sulfate micelles demonstrated a long-helix-turn-short-helix structure
exhibiting restricted backbone motions. The cell-selective activity
of the furin peptides and their unique mode of action on membranes
have a significant potential for the development of therapeutics.

Introduction
Antibiotic-resistant
bacteria are the eminent global health threat
that may kill over 30 million people by 2050.1−3 In the United
States alone, annually over 2 million population are estimated to
be infected by drug-resistant bacteria.4 Infections caused by multidrug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus
aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) could be untreatable.5,6 On the face of escalating
drug resistance, a high attrition rate has slowed the discovery of
new antibiotics that often uses old drug as starting candidates.7,8 Only three antibiotics were approved by the food and drug administration
(FDA) of the United States in past few years.7,8 Although
the pipeline of small molecule antibiotics are becoming limiting,
there has been a pronounced interest in developing antimicrobial peptides
(AMPs) to enrich antibiotic resources.9−13 AMPs, also known as host defense peptides, exist
in all life forms encompassing bacteria, plants, invertebrates, and
vertebrates.14−16 Naturally occurring cationic AMPs in animals constitute
an integral part of the innate and also adaptive immune defense systems.17−19 These amphipathic AMPs target the negatively charged lipid of the
membrane of microbes by passing the recognition of any surface receptor.
The membrane permeabilization mechanism of AMPs involves disruption
of the permeability barrier of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) or cell wall followed by pore formation in the lipid bilayer.20−25 The membranolytic activity of AMPs would cause a challenge toward
developing drug resistance in bacteria.20−25 Nonmembranolytic AMPs with an alternate mode of action that target
intracellular macromolecular proteins or DNA are also described.26−28

In humans, host defense proteins and peptides play eminent
roles
in eliminating invading pathogens as a part of innate immunity.29,30 The antimicrobial peptide database (APD) lists a total of 123 antimicrobial
peptides and proteins.31 Human AMPs, defensins
(α and β), cathelicidin LL37, histatins, and dermcidin,
are expressed in variety of tissues, cells, and eccrine systems including
skin, eyes, sweat, lungs, intestine lining, and urinary bladder.32−36 Several large human proteins e.g., multiple RNases, lysozyme, chemokines,
and psoriasin are known to be possessing antimicrobial activity.29,37,38 Apart from the bona fide AMPs
and antimicrobial proteins, peptide fragments of native proteins of
human have demonstrated antimicrobial activity.39−42 Prodomains of proteases are cleaved
during the maturation or activation of the enzymes. The proteolysis-derived
peptide fragments may display antimicrobial activity in host defense
systems.43−45 Furin, a serine proprotein convertase, is widely
expressed in numerous cells and remains responsible for processing
precursor proteins in the constitutive secretory pathways.46,47 Furin can activate bacterial and viral toxin proteins and is a target
for drug development.46,47 The 81-residue furin prodomain
undergoes proteolytic cleavages during the activation of the zymogen.46,47 In solution, furin prodomain assumes partially folded molten globule
like conformations or helical structures.48,49 Several recent studies demonstrated important cellular activities
of the prodomain of furin including anticancer activity.50−54

In this work, we demonstrate that peptides derived from the
central
cationic/aromatic rich region of the furin prodomain delineated potent
antibacterial activity against Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and MRSA-resistant Staphylococcus strains. These antimicrobial peptides were
low in hemolytic and cytotoxic activity to mammalian cells. As a mode
of action, potent peptides interacted especially with the negatively
charged lipids in model membranes, disrupted outer membrane LPS, neutralized
surface charge, and permeabilized bacterial cell membrane. The atomic-resolution
structure of a 26-residue long active peptide, termed YR26, was determined
by NMR in the presence of negatively charged sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) micelles. The structure revealed a novel fold consisting of
an N-terminal long helix followed by a tight turn and C-terminus short
helix. This study underscores the significance of the prodomain of
proteases and proprotein convertases in generating cell-specific antimicrobial
peptides that can be potentially used for the development of antibiotics
that are nontoxic to human.

Results
Screening of Peptide Fragments
Derived from the Prodomain of
Furin for Antimicrobial Activity
The primary structure of
the prodomain of furin is rich in basic amino acids (pI ∼ 11.93)
with a high preponderance of aliphatic and aromatic amino acids. Also,
previous NMR structures revealed that the prodomain of furin assumed
discretely folded helical conformations across several segments in
2,2,2-trifluoroethanol/water solution.48,49 Such sequences
and structural characteristics are also usually observed in membrane
active AMPs. The C-terminus of the prodomain of furin is highly cationic
and hydrophobic, therefore, we constructed overlapping peptide fragments,
of various lengths, 15–35 residues, and examined antimicrobial
activity (Figure 1 and Table 1). However, all five
peptides, derived from the C-terminus were found to be largely inactive,
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 100 μM, against
representative
Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains (Table 1). An N-terminal-derived peptide fragment,
QF35, was also mostly inactive, except for Escherichia
coli, MIC ∼ 20 μM (Table 1). To further map the internal sequence of
the prodomain, two overlapping peptide fragments, RV23 and YR26, were
obtained (Figure 1).
The RV23 peptide did not delineate antibacterial activity except for E. coli (Table 1). Remarkably, the YR26 peptide fragment demonstrated
growth inhibition against all of the bacterial strains with low MIC
values (Table 1). To
further determine sequence–activity correlations, several deletion
analogs, from the C-terminus, of the active fragment YR26 were examined
(Figure 1 and Table 2). The last three
amino acids, QLR, of YR26 were found to be dispensable toward antibacterial
activity (Table 2).
The YR23 peptide demonstrated MIC values similar to the parent YR26
peptide (Tables 1 and 2). Furthermore, YR26 and YR23 peptides demonstrated
growth inhibition against MRSA-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermis (Table 2). Peptide YR20, obtained from
a further deletion of three residues of YR23, showed somewhat higher
MIC values, in comparison to YR26 and YR23 peptides (Table 2). Further deletion of the three
residues has yielded a largely inactive peptide, YH17 (Table 2). Interestingly, the more truncated
variants, peptides YL14 and YR12 demonstrated improved activity profiles
compared to the YH17 peptide fragment (Table 2).

Hemolysis and Fibroblast
Cell Toxicity of the Prodomain-Derived
AMPs
AMPs can be hemolytic and toxic to mammalian cells which
would impede therapeutic development.55,56 The effect
of the antibacterial YR26, YR23, and YR20 peptides in the lysis of
human red blood cells (RBCs) and their toxicity towards mouse fibroblast
cells were examined (Figure 2, panels A and B). Figure 2A shows percentage hemolysis as a function of concentrations
of prodomain-derived peptides. All three peptides demonstrated remarkably
low hemolytic activity. At the highest concentration, 160 μM,
of peptides, YR26 delineated an estimated hemolysis of 7.65%, whereas
YR23 and YR20 peptides showed even lower hemolysis (Figure 2A). Interestingly, a high hemolytic
activity, ∼71%, was estimated for the inactive peptide RV23
(Figure 2A). The viability
of mouse NIHT3T cells was estimated by standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assays at 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μM concentrations
of peptides (Figure 2B). Cell viability was largely unaffected in the presence of the
YR23 peptide even at the highest peptide concentration. Cell viability
appeared to be somewhat decreased for YR26 and YR20 peptides at concentrations
of 50 and 100 μM (Figure 2B). Note, MIC values of most active YR26 and YR23 peptides
were estimated to be in the range of 2–6 μM (Table 2). Therefore, low
hemolytic and high cell viability of the prodomain-derived AMPs demonstrate
their therapeutic potential. In particular, hemolytic activity and
cytotoxicity were deduced to be the lowest for the YR23 peptide.

Inhibition of TNF-α and IL-1β Cytokine Release from
THP-1 Cells
Due to the lower cytotoxicity, the YR23 peptide
was selected to examine inflammatory activity using the human monocytic
cell line, THP-1. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed
to estimate the secreted TNF-α and IL-1β at graded concentrations
of the YR23 peptide from LPS-treated THP-1 cells. To determine percentage
inhibition, cytokines were also measured in the supernatant of cell
culture in the absence and presence of LPS. As seen, YR23 demonstrated
a dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-α and IL-β secretion
from LPS-induced THP-1 cell lines (Figure 2, panels C and D). There was a gradual increase
in the inhibition of TNF-α from 28 to 50% (Figure 2C) and IL-1β from 15
to 30% (Figure 2D)
at 5 μM to 30 μM concentrations of the YR23 peptide. Therefore,
the prodomain-derived peptide fragment YR23 retains the ability of
suppressing the release of cytokines from human THP-1 cell line.

Disruption of Outer Membrane Permeability and Surface Charge
Neutralization of E. coli Cells
We examined perturbation of the outer membrane and ζ-potential
by the prodomain-derived peptides. N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine
(NPN), a fluorescent probe, is excluded from membrane interactions
due to the permeability barrier of the outer membrane. Disruption
of the outer membrane, caused by membrane active agents, allows NPN
to interact with membrane lipids leading to an enhanced fluorescence
emission. In separate experiments, NPN fluorescence emission spectra
were obtained in E. coli cell solutions
upon addition of various concentrations, ranging from 0 to 5 μM,
of YR26, YR23, YR20, and YR12 peptides at a fixed probe concentration. Figure 3A shows the emission
intensity (λmax ∼ 410 nm) of NPN at different
doses of peptides. Clearly, inclusion of the active peptides YR26
and YR23 into NPN E. coli cell solutions
has caused a marked increase in the fluorescence intensity of the
probe. The fluorescence intensity of NPN steadily increased from 0.5
to 2 μM peptide concentrations and attained a plateau beyond
3 μM concentration for both the peptides (Figure 3A). A somewhat lower change in fluorescence
of NPN was observed upon addition of the YR20 peptide compared to
YR26 and YR23. By contrast, only limited fluorescence enhancement
of the probe was observed for the YR12 peptide (Figure 3A).

Figure 3 Prodomain-derived antibacterial peptides disrupted
the outer membrane
and neutralized the surface charge of E. coli cells. (A) Outer membrane permeability assay using NPN as a fluorescence
probe. Increase in fluorescence intensity by the antibacterial peptides,
YR26, YR23, and YR20 indicated their efficacy to permeabilize the
outer cell membrane. (B) The ζ-potential of E.
coli cells in the presence of varying concentrations
of furin prodomain-derived peptides.

Towards bacterial cell killing, cationic AMPs can neutralize
the
negatively charged cell membrane which is thought to be important
for membranolytic activity. Modes of membrane interactions of the
prodomain-derived peptides were further investigated by measuring
the ζ-potential of E. coli cell
solutions. A predominantly negative ζ-potential, ∼−50
mV, of E. coli cells arises from phosphate
and carboxylate of the outer membrane lipids and LPS molecules (Figure 3B).57,58 The ζ-potential of E. coli cell
solutions was measured at various concentrations, 5–30 μM,
of YR26, YR23, YR20, and YR12 peptides in independent experiments
(Figure 3B). As evident,
the YR26 and YR23 peptides demonstrated the most efficient neutralization
of the bacterial surface charge (Figure 3B). Even at 5 μM concentration of peptides,
the bacterial surface charge became neutral for YR26 and remained
low negative for YR23 (Figure 3B). The ζ-potential values were estimated to be positive,
+5 to +10 mV, at the higher doses of YR26 and YR23 peptides. As seen,
the ability of the YR20 peptide to completely neutralize the surface
charge was lower compared to YR26 and YR23 peptides (Figure 3B). By contrast, the short
peptide YR12 delineated a poor charge neutralization activity. Therefore,
antibacterial peptides, YR26 and YR23, could efficiently disrupt the
permeability barrier of the outer membrane and neutralize the surface
charge of Gram-negative bacteria. Whereas, the YR20 peptide appeared
to be moderately active in membrane permeabilization and charge neutralization.
By contrast, the less active YR12 peptide delineated a limited outer
membrane permeabilization and surface charge neutralization.

Interactions
of the Prodomain-Derived Peptides with LPS
LPS is the major
constituent of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane
of Gram-negative bacteria.59,60 Cationic AMPs might
interact with the negatively charged LPS-outer membrane for disrupting
the membrane barrier.21,61 Interactions of LPS and prodomain
peptides were investigated by using multiple methods, including isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC), intrinsic Trp fluorescence of peptides,
and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Figure 4 (panels A–D) shows ITC thermograms
of the interactions of the prodomain peptides with LPS. The ITC data
revealed that peptide/LPS interactions were driven by exothermic processes
as evident from the negative heat or downward positions of ITC thermal
profiles. Table 3 summarizes
binding affinity and thermodynamic parameters of prodomain peptides/LPS
interactions. The active peptides YR26, YR23, and also YR20 interacted
with LPS delineating comparable Kd values.
By contrast, the YR12 peptide of limited antibacterial activity interacted
with LPS with appreciably low affinity (Table 3). Furthermore, intrinsic Trp fluorescence
emission spectra of the prodomain-derived peptides were obtained at
various concentrations of LPS. Binding of the prodomain antimicrobial
peptides with LPS caused a blue-shift of the emission maxima of Trp
residue and concomitant quenching of the emission intensity with increased
concentrations of LPS (Figure 5A). The observed blue shift in fluorescence emission maxima
suggested that the Trp residue of the prodomain antimicrobial peptides
inserts into the hydrophobic milieu of LPS. Notably, YR26, YR23, and
YR20 showed higher λmax shift compared to the YR12
peptide. The ability of the prodomain antimicrobial peptides to perturb
LPS structural organization was probed by DLS experiments. In solution,
LPS forms large micelle aggregates that could be disassembled into
smaller sizes upon binding with cationic AMPs or LPS neutralizing
proteins.62−64 The size of the LPS micelle was estimated in free
solution and at various molar ratios, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4, of peptides
(Figure 5, panels C–E).
As one would expect, the active peptides YR26, YR23, and YR20 demonstrated
large reduction of aggregated/micelle sizes of LPS in a dose-dependent
manner. The free LPS micelles showed an average diameter (RH) of 958 nm, whereas 214 and 217 nm RH values were estimated in the complex with
YR26 and YR23 peptides at a 1:1 ratio, respectively. The less active
peptide YR12 delineated disaggregation of LPS micelle sizes to a lower
extent, an RH of 664 nm was estimated
at a 1:1 ratio. Collectively, these aforementioned results demonstrated
that the antibacterial prodomain peptides YR26, YR23, and YR20 could
efficiently interact and destabilize LPS-aggregated structures.

Entrapped Dye Leakage and Interactions of the Prodomain Peptides
with Liposomes
Lipid vesicles, entrapped with 5-carboxyfluorescein
(CF) dye, purely consisted of either zwitterionic lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) or as a mixture of anionic
lipids POPC/2-oleoyl-1-pamlitoyl-sn-glyecro-3-glycerol
(POPG) (3:1) were prepared and the ability of the prodomain peptides
to release the entrapped dye was investigated. The extent of the CF
dye release from POPC/POPG (3:1) and POPC lipid vesicles was estimated
as a function of different doses of prodomain peptides (Figure 6, panels A and B). As evident,
the active peptides, YR26 and YR23, had caused leakage of the CF dye
from the POPC/POPG (3:1) vesicles (Figure 6A). By contrast, prodomain peptides were
unable to induce the release of the entrapped dye from POPC vesicles
(Figure 6B).

Figure 6 Binding of
prodomain-derived antibacterial peptides to lipid vesicles.

YR23, and YR12 peptides from (A) POPC–POPG vesicles and (B)
POPC vesicles. (C–F) Bar diagrams show the particle size distribution
of POPC–POPG vesicles, estimated from DLS experiments, in free
solutions and at different molar ratios of peptides (C) YR26, (D)
YR23, (E) YR20, and (F) YR12.

To correlate lipid binding specificity, we investigated the
binding
and perturbation of the liposomes with prodomain-derived peptides
using intrinsic Trp fluorescence (Supporting Information Figure S1) and DLS experiments (Figure 6, panels C–F, Supporting
Information Figure S2). As seen, Trp emission
maxima of YR26 and YR23 antibacterial peptides experienced a marked
blue shift and a high quantum yield in emission intensity with increasing
concentrations of POPC/POPG large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), suggesting
the incorporation of the fluorophore in the nonpolar environment of
the liposomes (Supporting Information Figure S1). Interestingly, the YR12 peptide also showed interactions with
POPC/POPG LUVs similar to the active peptides YR26 and YR23 (Supporting
Information Figure S1). By contrast, there
were no discernable changes in the Trp emission maxima for any of
the peptides in POPC LUVs, implying limited interactions with zwitterionic
lipids (Supporting Information Figure S1).

Binding interactions of the prodomain peptides with lipid
vesicles
were further investigated by assessing size distribution by using
DLS studies. There were no significant changes in the mean diameter
of zwitterionic POPC liposomes even at 4-fold higher concentrations
of the peptides (Supporting Information Figure S2 and Table S1). These observations suggested that the prodomain-derived
antibacterial peptides were unable to impart any structural perturbation
toward zwitterionic liposomes. Remarkably, inclusions of YR26, YR23,
and YR20 peptides into solutions containing POPC/POPG (3:1) lipid
vesicles yielded a large increase in the size of the liposome (Figure 6, panels C–F
and Table S2). The mean diameter of the
liposomes was estimated to be increased as a function of peptide concentrations
(Figure 6 and Table S1). Notably, the increase of the liposome
size was limited and observed only at higher molar ratios for the
YR12 peptide (Table S2). Therefore, lipid
vesicle studies established that the antibacterial prodomain peptides
selectively bind to the liposome containing the negatively charged
phospholipids. The binding has induced leakage of dye from the liposomes
and fusion of liposomes.

NMR Structure and Backbone Mobility of YR26
Peptide
The atomic-resolution structure and 15N backbone dynamics
of the long active peptide YR26 were determined in a negatively charged
SDS micelle using 1H and 15N NMR spectroscopy.
For heteronuclear NMR experiments, YR26 was recombinantly expressed, 15N isotope labeled and purified from KSI fusion protein (see Materials and Methods). Sequence-specific resonance
assignments of residues were achieved by analyses of two-dimensional 1H–1H TOCSY, NOESY, and 15N edited
three-dimensional (3D) NOESY-HSQC experiments. Figure 7A shows the 15N–1H HSQC spectrum of YR26 showing cross-peak assignments. Analyses
of 1H–1H two-dimensional (2D) NOESY and
3D NOESY-HSQC spectra revealed sequential and medium range (i to i + 2, i + 3, i + 4) NOEs involving backbone/backbone, backbone/sidechain,
and sidechain/sidechain. Figure 7B summarizes the number of NOEs observed for residues
of YR26 in SDS micelles. Residue W42 delineated as many as 19 NOEs
followed by residues L51 and H58 with 17 and 16 NOEs, respectively
(Figure 7B). Notably,
the medium range NOEs could not be ascertained for residues P53-R54-P55-R56
at the C-terminal half of YR26. An ensemble of the micelle-bound structure
of YR26 was determined, by using CYANA, from 191 NOE driven distance
and 40 backbone dihedral angle (ϕ, ψ) constrains (Figure 8A). Structural parameters
and statistics are listed in the Supporting Information Table S3. The root-mean-square deviation values
of backbone atoms (Cα, C′, N) and all heavy atoms were
estimated to be 0.27 and 1.7 Å, respectively (Table S3). The YR26 prodomain peptide assumes a helix-turn-helix
structure in SDS micelle. The N-terminus of the molecule, comprising
residues Y39-S52, folds into a long helix. This is followed by a sharp
turn consisting of residues P53-P56 and a short C-terminal helix encompassing
residues R57-Q62 (Figure 8B). The N-terminus helix appears to be slightly deviated from
an idealized geometry at residue H43, showing a backbone dihedral
angle of ϕ ∼ −110°, ψ ∼ −38°.
There are potential sidechain packing interactions among aromatic
residues H40/W42/H43 and residues Y38/F41 (Figure 8B). The helix-turn-helix structure demonstrates
multiple cationic patches throughout the topology (Figure 8C). Remarkably, a large cationic
patch can be realized by the sidechain of residues, K48, R49, R55,
R57, R60, and R63, from the N- and C-termini helices (Figure 8C). The cationic patch could
be further complemented by basic sidechains of residues H54 and H58
(Figure 8C). A short
cationic patch is sustained by the sidechains of residues R44/H43/H40
at the N-terminus half (Figure 8C).

except for residue R63, of YR26 were determined by measuring 15N spin relaxation rates, longitudinal relaxation (R1), transverse relaxation (R2), and heteronuclear NOE. The fast motion of the N–H
bond vector, at picosecond and nanosecond time scale, is sensitive
to these relaxation parameters. As seen, both R1 and R2 values were found to be
largely uniform for almost all residues of YR26 (Figure 9, panels A and B). Residues
Y39 and Q62, located near the termini, showed somewhat lower R2 values compared to other residues. High heteronuclear
NOE values (0.45–0.62) were estimated for most of the residues
of YR26 suggesting that the residues are conformationally rigid (Figure 9C). Residues Arg49
and Ser52 delineated comparatively lower NOE values (0.38–0.41)
indicating that the region may be relatively mobile. Residues Tyr39
and Gln62 near the termini showed much lower NOE values of 0.17 and
0.24, respectively. This suggests that the residues near the terminal
are flexible, as expected.

Discussion
Cell-Selective Antimicrobial and Anti-inflammatory
Peptides
from the Prodomain of Furin
Discovery, characterization,
and mode of action of new cell-selective AMPs would be valuable to
strengthen the pool of antimicrobial compounds. Several methods are
employed to identify AMPs including screening of peptide libraries,
computer-aided design and de novo design.13,65−69 Notably, a recent study, aimed to screen antimicrobial peptides
from a massive pool of random sequences, demonstrated that only 1.7%
of the sequence space could be active.13 On the basis of the cationicity and hydrophobicity, we surmised
that the prodomain of furin may yield antimicrobial peptides. Toward
this, we designed several overlapping synthetic peptide fragments
from the N and C-termini of prodomain of furin for screening antibacterial
activity. As seen, many of the prodomain peptide fragments were largely
devoid of antibacterial activity with MIC > 100 μM (Figure 1 and Table 1). Remarkably, an internal peptide
fragment, residues Y38-R62 or YR26, demonstrated potent broad-spectrum
activity, MIC ranges between 2 and 4 μM, against several bacterial
strains (Table 2).
The N-terminus of YR26 consists of a stretch of aromatic residues
Y38YHFWH43 whereas the C-terminal region is more variable with cationic,
polar, and Pro residues (Figure 1). Deletion of either three or six residues at the
C-terminus, yielding peptides YR23 and YR20, respectively, did not
largely affect antibacterial activity. However, YR20 delineated slightly
higher MICs (Table 2). The antibacterial peptides, YR26, YR23, and YR20, were found to
be poorly hemolytic and also displayed low toxicity to fibroblast
cells. Notably, in comparison to other prodomain peptide fragments,
the YR23 peptide not only retained a broad-spectrum antibacterial
activity but also demonstrated least toxicity toward RBC and fibroblast
cells. Furthermore, in a set of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
assays, YR23 efficiently blocked LPS or endotoxin-induced release
of cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β from THP-1 cell line. The
inhibition of cytokine release indicated that the YR23 peptide can
ameliorate toxicity of LPS.

Furin Prodomain-Derived Antibacterial Peptides
Interacted with
LPS and Disrupted LPS-Outer membrane
The outer-membrane of
Gram-negative bacteria establishes a permeability barrier due to a
high content of LPS molecules located at the outer leaflet of the
bilayer.70,71 Hydrophobic antibiotics and antibacterial
agents could be excluded by the LPS-outer membrane.70,71 The LPS-mediated barrier appears to be causing significant difficulty
in drug development against Gram-negative pathogens.6,7,22 Notably, during septic shock
syndrome caused by LPS or endotoxin in blood stream, over production
of the tissue damaging cytokines contribute to the multiple organ
failures and fatal outcome.72,73 In the absence of therapeutics,
there are ongoing efforts to develop drugs against sepsis.74,75 Cationic AMPs and LPS interacting molecules are considered as vital
leads for the antisepsis drug development.61,69 The antibacterial peptides YR26, YR23, and YR20 permeabilized LPS-outer
membrane and neutralized surface charge of bacterial cells (Figure 3). Binding of the
prodomain-derived peptides to LPS, estimated by ITC experiments, revealed
that the active peptides bind to LPS with higher affinity compared
to peptide YR12 which displayed a high MIC (Table 3). Moreover, the exothermic binding observed
in the ITC thermograms supported prevalent ionic and/or polar interactions
of the antibacterial cationic peptides with the negatively charged
LPS (Figure 4 and Table 3). The ionic interactions
are considered to be the first step in anchoring AMPs to the bacterial
cell wall components.20−22 Intrinsic Trp fluorescence revealed that the Trp
residues of YR26, YR23, and YR20 peptides inserted into the lipidic
milieu of LPS. Furthermore, as evident from DLS studies, binding of
the prodomain antibacterial peptides to LPS has yielded significant
disruption of the higher order assemblies of LPS into smaller aggregated
structures (Figure 5). By contrast, the YR12 peptide, delineating lower antibacterial
activity, was found to be limited in cell permeabilization and LPS
structural perturbation. Therefore, LPS-outer membrane interactions
and perturbation of LPS structures would be critical in the antibacterial
activity of AMPs.

Antibacterial Prodomain Peptides Interacted
with Negatively
Charged Lipid Vesicles Causing Dye Leakage and Aggregations
Lipid vesicles or liposomes are widely used as a close mimic of the
plasma membrane of cells. The inner membrane of a bacterial cell contains
more negatively charged PG phospholipids, whereas the plasma membrane
of mammalian or human cells are rich in zwitterionic phospholipids.
Prodomain peptides interacted specifically with the negatively charged
POPC/POPG vesicles compared to vesicles consisting of zwitterionic
POPC lipids (Figure 6). These data correlate well with the limited ability of the antibacterial
peptides to lyse human RBC and low toxicity to fibroblast cells. Notably,
active peptides, YR26, YR23, and YR20, and also the less active peptide,
YR12, were found to be inserted into POPC/POPG vesicles. However,
only binding of the antibacterial peptides, YR26 and YR23 to POPC/POPG
vesicles had promoted the release of the entrapped CF dye and transformation
of liposomes into large aggregated structures. It is worth mentioning
that the leakage of the entrapped dye from liposomes are usually observed
by pore forming AMPs.20−24 However, the fusion of liposomes induced by cationic AMPs had been
delineated for mouse defesine cryptdin-4, Lfcin B, and MSI 103.76−78 Such liposome fusion perhaps indicates an efficient insertion of
the AMPs into bilayer and perturbation of packing interactions among
the lipid molecules.78

Novel Helix-Turn-Helix
Structure of YR26 Prodomain Peptide YR26
in SDS Micelle
The atomic-resolution structure and backbone
dynamics of the YR26 peptide were elucidated in a solution of SDS
micelle by NMR spectroscopy. Note that the negatively charged SDS
micelles are frequently used as a bacterial membrane mimic for the
structural determination of AMPs. Heteronuclear NOEs demonstrated
that most of the residues of YR26, except for few at the termini,
are motionally rigid in the micelle-bound state (Figure 9). In SDS micelle, YR26 folded
into a compact helix-turn-helix structure. In particular, the two
helices, long N-terminal and short C-terminal, are orientated in an
antiparallel manner and are connected by a tight turn maintained by
multiple Pro residues (Figure 8). The helix-turn-helix structure of YR26 appears to be lacking
a clear disposition of nonpolar and cationic faces which are frequently
observed in micelle-bound structures of amphipathic AMPs.22−24 However, the tertiary fold of the YR26 peptide in the SDS micelle
is sustained by the isolated patches of aromatic and cationic surfaces
(Figure 8). Strikingly,
in the bipartite helical structure, the N-terminal helix are predominantly
involved in the aromatic cluster, residues H40/W42/H43 and Y38/F41,
whereas only fewer residues, R44, K48, and R49 are found in the cationic
patch. The fold back of the C-terminal helix maintains most of the
cationic surface of the structure of YR26 through residues R55, R57,
R60, and R63 (Figure 8). The atomic-resolution structure of YR26 and biophysical experiments
may provide mechanistic insights into bacterial membrane interactions
and permeabilization. The cationic patches of the helix-turn-helix
structure are likely to establish ionic interactions with the negatively
charged phosphates of the LPS-outer membrane and also with the plasma
membrane of bacteria. The ionic interactions between YR26 and the
membrane appeared to be highly critical. Since, deletion of residues,
including many cationic ones, of the C-terminal helix and loop, in
analog YH17, drastically impaired antibacterial activity, we surmise
that followed by membrane charge neutralization, aromatic and nonpolar
residues of the helix-loop-helix structure would insert into the hydrophobic
environment of the membrane. These interactions between membranes
and prodomain peptide YR26 are likely to cause disruption of membrane
packing that may lead to bacterial cell death.

In conclusion,
the current work has defined human furin prodomain peptide fragments
with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity including MRSA-resistant Staphylococcus strains. The antibacterial peptides are extremely
nonhemolytic, nontoxic to mammalian cells, and able to suppress tissue
damaging cytokine release. As a mode of action, the prodomain peptides
interacted specifically with negatively charged lipids including the
LPS-outer membrane and disrupted bacterial membrane integrity. The
atomic-resolution structure of YR26 obtained in SDS micelle described
the potential membrane interacting cationic and aromatic surfaces.
The antibacterial activity, atomic-resolution structure, and associated
biophysical characteristics of the prodomain furin peptides can be
further utilized for the development of cell-selective antimicrobial
drugs and materials.

Materials and Methods
Furin prodomain-derived
peptides (95% pure) were purchased from
Synpeptide Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). LPS from E.
coli 0111:B4, MH broth, SDS, and fluorescent dyes,
NPN and 6-carboxyfluorescein, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Lipids
such as POPC and POPG and the extruder used for the preparation of
liposomes were procured from Avanti Polar lipids (Alabaster, AL).
NMR reagents such as 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane 5-sulfonate sodium
salt (DSS), D2O, and SDS-d25 were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc (MA).

Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration Measurement
Minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of prodomain peptides was measured
using the broth dilution method. Mid-log phase cultures of four Gram-negative
(E. coli, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, K. Pneumoniae ATCC 13883, S. enterica ATCC 14028), four Gram-positive (B. subtilis, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. pyogenes ATCC 19615, E. faecalis ATCC 29212) bacteria, and two Gram-positive-resistant
strains (S. aureus ATCC BAA-44 and S. epidermis ATCC 51625) were diluted in MHB to a
final concentration of 5 × 105 CFU/mL. In a 96-well
plate, 50 μL of peptides at final concentrations ranging from
30 to 0.25 μM were prepared and another 50 μL of the diluted
bacterial solutions were added to each of the wells. The plate was
incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. OD600 was measured and
the minimum concentration at which there is complete inhibition of
bacterial growth was recorded as the MIC of the peptide.

Hemolysis Assay
Fresh blood samples were taken from
a healthy volunteer. The erythrocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7) and
5% blood solution was prepared in PBS. In a 96-well plate, 50 μL
of varying concentrations of peptides were prepared. Another 50 μL
of 5% blood solution was added to each well. The plate was incubated
for 1 h at 37 °C. The plate was centrifuged and the OD540 of the supernatant was measured. 1% triton-X was taken as a positive
control and PBS was taken as a negative control. % hemolysis was calculated
as: , where, OD: OD540 for any well
ODnegative: OD540 for negative control ODpositive: OD540 for positive control

Cytotoxicity
Test
NIH3T3 cell line was used to test
the toxicity of the furin peptides towards mammalian cells. 10 000
cells were added per well in a 96-well plate and the plates were incubated
overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 24 h, media was
removed and 100 μL of the desired concentration of peptides
were added into fresh media. The plates were incubated for 4 h at
37 °C and 5% CO2. The media was further replaced and
10 μL of MTT was added into each well followed by incubation
for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Finally, the media was
removed from every well and 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide was
added to solubilize the crystals. The plates were incubated for 10
min. Each well was mixed thoroughly and OD was taken at 540 nm. For
a negative control, no peptide was added and for positive control,
no cells were added. % cell viability was calculated as: , where, OD: OD540 for any well,
ODnegative: OD540 for negative control, ODpositive: OD540 for positive control.

Cytokine Release
Assays
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays were performed to estimate the secreted TNF-α and IL-1β
in LPS-treated THP-1 cells in the presence of YR23 peptide after 4–12
h of incubation, as described elsewhere.79 Cytokines in culture supernatant of untreated and LPS-treated cells
were taken as minimum and maximum to determine percentage inhibition
by YR23. The concentrations of TNF-α and IL-1β in the
samples were estimated using human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
kits for TNF-α (BD Biosciences cat. no. 555212) and IL-1β
(BD Biosciences cat. no. 557953) according to the manufacturers’
protocol. All experiments were repeated thrice and the average values
of the cytokine concentrations were reported.

Outer Membrane Permeabilization
Assay
The ability of
the peptides to permeabilize the outer membrane was examined using
the 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) dye. E. coli cells were grown to mid-log phase and were
diluted to OD600 of 0.5 in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.
10 μM of NPN was added to the cells and basal fluorescence was
recorded. This was followed by the addition of increasing concentrations
of peptides and recording the emission spectra. Excitation wavelength
was set as 350 nm and emission wavelength was recorded from 390 to
450 nm. The fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Cary Eclipse
fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Inc) equipped with dual monochromators.
Finally, the fluorescence intensity at maxima was estimated to examine
the effect of the peptides on the outer membrane of the E. coli cells.

ζ-Potential Measurement
Mid-log phase E. coli were diluted
to an OD600 of 0.2
in LB media. The ζ-potential of the bacterial cells was first
measured in disposable zeta cells with gold electrodes. This was followed
by adding increasing concentrations of peptides and measuring the
ζ-potential. For each data point, 3 measurements of 100 runs
each were carried out. The experiments were carried out on a zeta
sizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, U.K.) equipped
with a 633 nm He laser.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
Interactions of prodomain-derived
antimicrobial peptides with LPS were studied using a microcal ITC
200 calorimeter. In the sample cell, 50 μM LPS in 10 mM phosphate
buffer, pH 7 was loaded cell. 500 μM peptide stock was loaded
in the syringe. The reference cell was filled with buffer and the
stirring speed was set at 900 rpm. 25 injections of 1.5 μL peptides
were made into the sample cell at 37 °C. A single-site binding
model in Microcal PEAQ-ITC analysis software was used to fit the raw
data to obtain the association constant (Ka) and enthalpy change (ΔH). Dissociation constant
(Kd), Gibbs free energy (ΔG), and entropy change (TΔS) were calculated as: Kd =
1/Ka, ΔG = −RT ln Ka, TΔS = ΔH –
ΔG.

Preparation of Liposomes
Bacterial
cell mimicking POPC–POPG
(3:1) liposomes and mammalian cell mimicking POPC liposomes were prepared
to study peptide interactions. Dry weights of the appropriate lipids
were measured in glass vials. Chloroform and methanol in the ratio
of 3:1 was added to the vials to dissolve the lipids. The solvent
was then evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas. This leads to
the formation of a thin film on the sides of the vials. The vials
were then freeze dried for 2 h to completely remove any trace of the
solvent. The film was then dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH
7. The mixture was sonicated in a water bath for 30 min. The liposomes
were made unilamellar by extruding the lipid through 100 nm membranes.
The lamellarity of the liposomes was confirmed by analyzing their
particle size by a dynamic light scattering technique. In the case
of carboxyfluorescein (CF) entrapped liposomes, the film was dissolved
in 10 mM phosphate buffer consisting of 70 mM CF. After extrusion,
the unbound CF was separated from the CF-bound liposomes using a PD-10
desalting column.

Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Experiments
Basal
fluorescence of the furin prodomain-derived peptides was measured
by exciting peptides at 280 nm and recording the emission spectra
from 300 to 400 nm. Change in the wavelength of emission intensity
maxima was observed by the addition of increasing concentrations of
LPS, POPC, and POPC–POPG liposomes. The fluorescence measurement
was carried out in a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer using
a 0.1 cm path length quartz cuvette.

Particle Size Analysis
by Dynamic Light Scattering
Ability of the furin prodomain-derived
AMPs to perturb liposomes
was examined by analyzing the particle size of 1 μM POPC–POPG
and POPC liposomes in the presence of increasing peptide concentrations.
The mean diameter of free liposomes was first determined in 10 mM
phosphate buffer, pH 7, using a dynamic light scattering instrument
(Brookhaven Instruments Corp., Holtsville, NY). DLS measurements were
then made for liposome:peptide ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4. The scattering
data was analyzed using the particle sizing software provided with
the instrument.

Carboxyfluorescein Leakage Assay
Membrane disruption
ability of the furin peptides was determined by examining the release
of carboxyfluorescein dye from CF-bound liposomes using the Cary Eclipse
fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Inc). Basal fluorescence of
the CF-bound liposomes was measured by exciting the vesicles at 495
nm and recording the emission fluorescence from 500 to 550 nm. Fluorescence
emission spectra in the presence of increasing peptide concentration
was also recorded. Change in emission intensity at maxima was then
plotted against peptide concentration to examine the CF leakage in
the presence of AMPs. The measurements were carried out using a 0.1
cm path length quartz cuvette.

Recombinant Expression
and Purification of Isotope-Labeled YR26
Peptide Fragment
A synthetic gene of YR26, from Shanghai
ShineGene Molecular Biotech, Inc, was cloned as a fusion protein in
a pET14b vector containing hydrophobic KSI at the N-terminus. The
pET14b vector contains six His-tag at the N-terminus for affinity
purification. An Asn-Pro sequence was introduced between KSI and hydrophilic
YR26 for chemical cleavage by formic acid. The recombinant plasmid
(containing ampicillin resistance) was transformed into Rosetta E. coli cells (having chloramphenicol resistance).
A single isolated colony was picked and cultured in LB medium with
ampicillin (100 μg/mL) and chloramphenicol (32 μg/mL)
overnight as a starter culture. Seed culture was transformed into
1L M9 media (containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol) in a 1:100
ratio by volume and was allowed to grow in a shaker incubator at 37
°C and 180 rpm for 6–7 h till its OD600 reached
0.6–0.8. The M9 media used consisted of 15N ammonium
chloride, necessary for 15N labeling. The culture was then
induced with 1 mM IPTG and was allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C
and 180 rpm. The cells were harvested at 7000 rpm. Expression was
checked using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel electrophoresis.
As the fusion protein is localized to inclusion bodies, protein purification
was carried out in denaturing conditions (8 M urea). The cells were
resuspended in binding buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM phosphate buffer, 300
mM NaCl), pH 8.0 and the mixture was incubated for 1 h while shaking
at room temperature. The cells were then lysed by sonication. To eliminate
cell debris, the translucent cell suspension was centrifuged at 15 000
rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the fusion
protein was then loaded on the Nickel-NTA column (QIAGEN) and eluted
using 8 M urea buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. Eluent containing
pure protein was kept for dialysis against water for 36–48
h to remove urea and salts. The dialyzed mixture was then treated
with 50% formic acid at 45–50 °C for 24 h in the dark.
Formic acid cleaves the D–P bond and separates the 15N-YR26 from KSI tag. Formic acid was removed using a rotary evaporator
and the obtained film was redissolved in water. KSI being very hydrophobic,
precipitated out leaving behind a solution of 15N YR26.
The peptide was further purified using high-performance liquid chromatography
and the major peak was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight and NMR.

NMR Experiments for Furin
Prodomain-Derived YR26
All
the NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer, equipped
with a cryo-probe and pulse field gradients. Data acquisition and
processing were performed with topspin software running on Linux workstation.
To determine the structure of YR26 in the presence of SDS micelles,
0.3 mM peptides and 200 mM SDS in aqueous solution containing 10%
D2O at pH 5 were used to acquire 2D 1H–1H TOCSY and NOESY spectra at 298 K. Mixing times of 80 ms
for TOCSY and 150 ms for NOESY were used. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane
5-sulfonate sodium salt (DSS) was used as an internal reference for
chemical shift. NOESY experiments were performed with 400 increments
in t1 and 64 transients. The WATERGATE procedure was used for water
signal suppression. A total of 2 K data points was used in t2 and
NMR data was analyzed in the Sparky (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller,
University of California, San Francisco, CA) program. Three-dimensional
(3D) 1H–15N–1H NOESY
experiment was performed with 128 increments in t1 and 48 increments
in t2. A total of 2 K data points were used in t3. Synthetic unlabeled
YR26 was used to acquire the 13C–1H HSQC
(natural abundance) spectrum in 100% D2O at 298 K. 0.4
mM YR26 and 200 mM SDS were used for the experiment with 1024 increments
in t1 and 56 transients. 15N–1H HSQC
experiment was conducted for 0.44 mM 15N YR26 and 220 mM
SDS at 298 K, pH 5. The experiment was performed with 96 increments
in t1 and 8 transients. 15N–1H heteronuclear
NOE relaxation experiment conducted with 128 increments in t1 and
8 transients. The spectrum was split into saturated and unsaturated
spectra of 1H resonances. Heteronuclear 15N–1H NOEs were determined as the ratio of the peak intensities
with and without proton saturation. The 15N longitudinal
(R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rate constants were determined by collecting
a time series of 15N–1H HSQC spectra
with sensitivity enhancement. For R1 measurements,
the spectra were acquired at relaxation delays of 0.2, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2,
1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 s, with repeat experiment at 1.5 s for error estimation.
For R2 measurements, the data were recorded
at 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, and 110 ms, with repeat experiment at 70 ms
for error measurement. For relaxation experiments, 2 K data points
were used in t2 with 90 increments in t1. The relaxation constants
were determined by fitting the cross-peak intensities to a monoexponential
function.

Structure Determination of YR26 in SDS Micelle
The
3D structure of YR26 in the presence of SDS was calculated using the
CYANA program. Distance restraints were estimated from two-dimensional
NOESY spectra on the basis of NOE intensities. Strong, medium, and
weak NOEs were translated to upper bound distance limits of 2.5, 3.5,
and 5.0 Å, respectively. Hα chemical shift deviation of
individual amino acids from the NOESY spectrum, 13C chemical
shift deviation from the 13C–1H HSQC
spectrum and 15N chemical shift deviation from the 15N–1H HSQC spectrum were incorporated in
SHIFTY to calculate dihedral angle constraint. Out of 100 structures
calculated, 20 lowest energy structures were kept for further analysis.
PROCHECK was used to produce the Ramachandran plot, which was in turn
used to validate the structures calculated.
