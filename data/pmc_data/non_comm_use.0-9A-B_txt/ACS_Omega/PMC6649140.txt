Monodispersed cerium oxide nanoparticles
(CeO2 NPs)
with positive and negative surface potential were synthesized by co-precipitation
method using hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP), respectively, as precipitating agents. Synthesized NPs were
characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV–Visible
(UV-Vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy,
and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Positively charged NPs of about
30 ± 10 nm in size formed within 5 h, aggregated in number, and
resulted in larger-sized NPs as a function of time. The CeO2 NPs were administered to Drosophila as a part of
their diet to study the effects on the growth and development of Drosophila. While the positively charged NPs did not affect
the growth of the third instar larvae, the negatively charged NPs
delayed the growth of larvae by about 7 days. It required 7 more days
to reach the stage of adult fly. TEM imaging of the larvae gut showed
that positively charged NPs were found to be smaller, whereas the
size of negatively charged NPs remained unchanged. This biodegradability
could be the reason for the delayed larvae growth in the case of negatively
charged particles. The distance covered by such second instar larvae
fed with diet containing negatively charged CeO2 NPs was
significantly lower, and their size was significantly smaller when
compared to the crawling activity and size of the third instar larvae
of the control group. Such positively charged NPs have high potential
for use as drug delivery carriers for the treatment of disease, and
negatively charged NPs may play a rather detrimental role.

1 Introduction
Lanthanide
elements, such as cerium, are gaining a profound importance
in many applications due to their excellent magnetic, optical, electrical,
and nuclear properties.1 Cerium (Ce) and
its oxides have received much attention in the fields of physics,
chemistry, material sciences, and biology.2 Their numerous properties are a result of the vacancies in their
valance shells, 4f and 5d, which change according to their chemical
environment. Cerium oxide (CeO2) has a cubic fluorite structure,
in which each cerium atom is surrounded by eight oxygen atoms in a
face-centered cubic (FCC) arrangement, which is stable from room temperature
to its melting point of 2400 °C. It is a nonstoichiometric compound
and exists in +3 (fully reduced) and +4 (fully oxidized) states, unlike
other lanthanide elements that exhibit only the +3 state. The ability
of CeO2 nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) to switch between
their dual oxidation states (+3 and +4) affords those properties,
such as the ability to store and transport oxygen,3 ability to absorb UV light,4 high thermal stability,5 electrical conductivity
and diffusivity,6 high hardness, and specific
chemical reactivity.7

CeO2 NPs are prepared by various methods including hydrothermal
process,8 sol–gel precipitation,9 microemulsion process,10 solvothermal synthesis,11 spray pyrolysis,
etc.12 Most of these methods involve the
use of high temperature and pressure and are difficult to control.
For instance, solvothermal method requires expensive equipment and
longer reaction time and poses safety concerns during reaction.11 Other drawbacks, such as the formation of submicrometer-sized
particles, polydispersed amorphous NPs, and the presence of impurities,
limit their use in the synthesis of CeO2 NPs for biological
applications.13−15 As a result, various surfactant molecules that could
directly reduce the Ce precursor salts into CeO2 NPs by
co-precipitation at room temperature and under benign conditions are
being continuously explored. Previous reports show that CeO2 NPs can be easily prepared by co-precipitating Ce(NO3)3·6H2O using poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)
or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) under basic conditions.16 However, the particles obtained were aggregated
and polydispersed with a size range of about 10–50 μm.
By using hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) as a surfactant, stable CeO2 NPs with a size ranging from 2.6 to 240 nm were prepared
by increasing the reaction time.17 Although
the study claims that size of the NPs increased as a function of time,
there is no information about the NP growth whether NPs are growing
continuously or undergo secondary aggregation during the growth process.
Moreover, the surface charge of NPs and its use in biological applications
need to be investigated in detail.

Various attempts have been
made to exploit the uniqueness of CeO2 NPs in switching
the oxidation states between +3 and +4 and
vice versa in biological applications as CeO2 NPs can act
as analogues to natural antioxidants. In biological systems, cells
under oxidative stress produce many reactive oxygen species (ROS)
such as superoxide anion radical (O2·),
hydroxyl radical (·OH), singlet oxygen (O2), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).18 These ROS are highly reactive compounds and
have the potential to damage and impair cell functioning. CeO2 NPs with +3 oxidation state can transmute ROS species into
H2O and O2 in two steps (ROS to H2O2 to H2O + O2) by changing its
oxidation state to +4.18 As these scavenging
activities mimic the role of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase
enzymes found in living systems,19 CeO2 NPs have been widely investigated for their antioxidant and
protective effect against cell damage caused by ROS,20 hydrogen peroxide,21 radiation,22 and antigenotoxic effect against potassium dichromate-induced
genotoxicity.23 Thus, the widespread use
of CeO2 NPs warrants the investigation of its potential
toxicity in in vivo models.

Among the reports discussed about
the cytotoxicity of CeO2 NPs in living systems, in vitro
toxicological investigations on
human (mesothelioma MSTO 211H) and rodent (3T3 fibroblast cells) cell
lines showed that short-term exposure to CeO2 NPs imparted
cytotoxicity on cells; however, the cells recovered gradually 6 days
after exposure.24 Similarly, a study on
inflammatory response of CeO2 NPs on human aortic endothelial
cells (HAECs) showed that NPs were benign and did not cause inflammation
in HAECs even at high concentrations.25 Investigations of CeO2 NPs with different surface charges
showed that positively charged particles favored protein adsorption
while negatively charged particles were found to be internalized inside
the cells.26 However, in vitro studies
using positively and negatively charged CeO2 NPs elicited
contrasting effects. Asati et al. reported that the toxicity elicited
by CeO2 NPs after its subcellular localization was based
on its surface charge. In cancer therapy, CeO2 NPs localized
in lysosomes exhibited significant cytotoxicity, whereas NPs localized
in the cytoplasm exhibited minimal cytotoxicity. Positively charged
CeO2 NPs were toxic to all cancer cells except breast cancer
cells due to its localization into lysosomes, and negatively charged
CeO2 NPs were toxic only to A459 lung cancer cells. The
neutrally charged CeO2 NPs were nontoxic to both normal
and cancer cells as it was localized primarily in the cytoplasm of
the cells. Interestingly, negatively charged CeO2 NPs were
not internalized by normal cells and hence were nontoxic.27 The toxicity of CeO2 NPs was also
studied in honeybees. Kos et al. investigated the effect of oral ingestion
of CeO2 NPs (2–500 mg/L) along with food on summer
and winter honeybees after 9 days of exposure. The highest dose (500
mg/L) of CeO2 NPs had no effect on the survival of honeybees.
However, both the summer and winter honeybees exhibited alterations
in biochemical parameters such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and
glutathione S-transferase (GST).28 Only a few studies have investigated the effect of CeO2 NPs in Drosophila melanogaster apart from in vitro models, and it was reported that nanoceria exerted
a protective effect against free-radical-mediated toxicity.29,30 Moreover, CeO2 NPs also elicited beneficial effects in Drosophila by increasing its lifespan by 38% and a 200%
increase in survival after exposure to a lethal dose of paraquat.29,31 Female flies were benefited more by the administration of CeO2 NPs as evidenced by the increase in median lifespan and maximum
lifespan by 18 and 19 days, respectively.30

This application of CeO2 NPs is also in concordance
with the work on effects of CeO2 NPs on differentiated
SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (neuronal model) for Alzheimer’s
disease research. CeO2 NPs exhibit both neurotrophic role
in protecting the cells against amyloid-β (Aβ) injury
and in Aβ-induced oxidative stress32 and neuroprotective activity in an in vitro mouse hippocampal brain
slice model of ischemia.33 The neuroprotective
effects of CeO2 NPs has also been reported in a mouse model
of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson’s
disease. CeO2 NPs at 0.5 μg/g were most effective
in elevating the striatal dopamine content and the numbers of TH+
neurons.34 Negatively charged nanoceria
with a zeta potential of −18.2 mV shows antigenotoxic and antioxidant
properties and is nontoxic up to a concentration of 10 mM in Drosophila.23Drosophila is widely used as an in vivo model to study the biological effects
as well as the toxicity of NPs35−37 since 75% of its genes are analogous
to the human disease-related genes. To the best of our knowledge,
there are no studies till date in Drosophila, investigating
the effect of charged nanoceria. In the present work, we used co-precipitation
method to synthesize negatively and positively charged CeO2 NPs by reducing Ce(NO3)3 with PVP and HMT,
respectively. Attempts have been made to synthesize stable CeO2 NPs with a size range of 10–20 nm, and particle growth
mechanisms have been investigated in detail. NPs with positive and
negative surface charge were fed to Drosophila melanogaster, and the growth and distance covered by larvae were investigated
to use the synthesized NPs for the treatment of Alzheimer’s
disease.

2 Results
2.1 Preparation of CeO2 NPs
Both positively (using HMT) and negatively (using
PVP) charged CeO2 NPs were stable and spherical with the
size range of about
20–30 nm (Figures 1–4). When HMT was used as a precipitating agent, the particle
size increased as a function of time, reaching a maximum of about
450 ± 30 nm (Figure 2). The size and surface potential of synthesized NPs are as
shown in Figure 5.
The NPs stabilized with HMT and PVP showed a potential of +27.6 and
−32.9 mV, respectively. Notably, synthesis of the NPs with
either surfactant yielded in differently charged cerium oxide NPs.
The surface potential of >25 mV along with a sharp single peak
showed
that the NPs formed were monodispersed and stable. These studies give
us knowledge on the accumulation of differently charged ions on the
surface of the NPs along with their specific potential.

2.1.1 UV–Visible spectroscopy
UV–Vis absorption spectra depicted in Figure 6 revealed strong absorption peaks in the
range between 280 and 300 nm, which are the specific characteristic
peaks of CeO2 NPs.

red, with a peak at 284 nm) and NaOH/PVP (in blue, with a peak at
294 nm).

2.1.2 FT-IR
Spectroscopy
The FT-IR spectrum
of CeO2 NPs synthesized with HMT shows three characteristic
peaks centered at 716, 2920, and 1500 cm–1, which
correspond to the rocking, stretching, and bending vibrations, respectively,
of the methyl groups of hexamine (Figure 7). It is worth noting that rocking vibrations
at 716 cm–1 is the characteristic peak for a minimum
of four methyl groups in a row, that is, (CH2)6 groups of HMT. The peaks observed at 1650 and 3468 cm–1 correspond to hydrogen-bonded O—H groups and stretching vibrations
of water molecules. The peak centered at ∼500 cm–1 is the characteristic peak for the formed cerium oxide NPs. The
spectrum of CeO2 NPs synthesized with PVP shows three characteristic
peaks at 3350, 1720, and 1620 cm–1, which correspond
to O—H groups of water molecules and C=O stretching
and C=C vibrations of PVP, respectively. The peaks at 2920,
1455, 1380, and 1290 cm–1 correspond to CH2 stretching, C—H deformation, CH3 symmetrical deformation
or CH2 bending, and C—N stretching, respectively.
The characteristic peak of CeO2 was observed at ∼480
cm–1.

2.1.3 XRD
Investigations
Despite the
fact that both patterns were in concordance with standard patterns
of CeO2 NPs (JCPDS card no. 34-0394), XRD patterns of both
NPs appeared to be distinct, which are shown in Figure 8. Notably, XRD peaks of negatively charged
NPs were sharp, which implies that the formed particles are precisely
crystalline and also match with the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 with miller indices (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400),
(331), and (420) at 28.5°, 33.08°, 47.47°, 56.3°,
69.4°, 76.7°, and 79.07°, respectively, whereas the
XRD patterns of positively charged particles also included peaks of
secondary structures of CeO2 NPs with miller indices (100),
(002), (101), (102), (110), and (202) at 24.4°, 27.4°, 30.3°,
38.5°, 45.2°, and 63°, respectively (JCPDS card no.
23-1048).

2.2.1 Effect of CeO2 NPs on Larval
Development
For larval development investigations, the size
of positively and negatively charged NPs used was 30 ± 10 and
20 ± 10, respectively. The third instar larvae that emerged after
7–10 days from the treatment groups were observed under a stereomicroscope.
While the larvae that fed on control and positively charged CeO2 NP-containing cornmeal diet did not exhibit any delayed development
and reached the third instar stage in 8 days, the larvae that fed
on negatively charged CeO2 NP-containing diet exhibited
delayed development and reached the third instar stage only after
15 days (Figure 9).
This adverse effect of negatively charged NPs was further investigated
using TEM/HR-TEM imaging in Figure 10. Notably, negatively charged NPs found in gut samples
were similar in size and morphology when compared to as-prepared NPs,
whereas the positively charged NPs were found to be smaller in size
in the gut, which can be due to biodegradation in the larvae gut.
It is believed that the larvae degrade positively charged NPs at a
higher rate than that of negatively charged NPs. The lower rate of
degradation of the negatively charged NPs can be pointed out as the
factor that influenced the delay in larvae development. This suggests
that the negatively charged CeO2 NPs causes the delay in
the development of the third instar larvae. However, no defects in
pupa formation were seen, and third instar larvae stopped feeding
to become pupae after reaching the third instar stage. Moreover, no
phenotypic defects were seen in the adult flies that hatched from
the third instar larvae from the positively and negatively charged
NP-containing food.

growth by 1 week. Scale bar = 500 μm.

that lattice fringes of CeO2 NPs are clearly visible in
insets of (b) and (c).

2.2.2 Effect of CeO2 NPs on Larval
Growth
The length and breadth of each larva was measured,
and statistical analysis was performed, as shown in Scheme 1 and Figure 11. While there was no statistical significance
in the length and breadth of positively charged CeO2 NP-fed
larvae, the larvae that fed on cornmeal diet containing negatively
charged CeO2 NPs exhibited a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in length at a dose of 1 mM and in breadth
at both doses [0.1 mM (P < 0.05) and 1 mM (P < 0.001)]. However, the length and breadth of the larvae
when they reached the third instar stage after a week were not statistically
significant at both 0.1 and 1 mM doses (Figure 11).

in length/breadth when compared to control.

2.2.3 Crawling
Assay
The larval crawling
assay was performed to assess the extent of neuronal damage as the
crawling activity is under the control of motor neurons present in
the ventral ganglion.38 The distances covered
by the larvae of control, 0.1 mM (A), 1 mM (A), 0.1 mM (B), and 1
mM (B) were 43.40, 49.81, 45.07, 30.18, and 26.51 mm/min, respectively
(Figure 12). Compared
to control, a statistically significant decrease in the distance covered
by the larvae was observed at 0.1 mM (P < 0.001)
and 1 mM (P < 0.0001) doses of the negatively
charged CeO2 NPs, and this indicates that the negatively
charged NPs affected the crawling activity of the third instar larvae.

charged CeO2 NPs, and (B) negatively charged CeO2 NP-containing food. The values represented are mean ± SEM (n = 9). Statistical significance was set to P < 0.05, and significant values indicate a decrease in distance
covered by larvae when compared to control.

3 Discussion
3.1 Synthesis of Positively and Negatively Charged
CeO2 NPs
CeO2 NPs with positive and
negative surface potential were prepared by co-precipitation of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O with HMT and PVP. Synthesis
with HMT is a single-step process, and the size of NPs increased as
a function of time. Initially, the reactant suspension was clear in
the first 2 h and turned into turbid as a function of time. This inference
was supported by performing time-dependent growth studies of the NPs
as shown in Figure 2. The formation of the NPs by using HMT is dependent on the duration
of the synthesis process, and the size of NPs is not constant at any
two different time intervals throughout the process. The estimated
particle size was about 3 nm after 3 h, which increased to 30 ±
10 nm after 5 h. When the reaction continued, the size of the particles
increased continuously and reached about 440 ± 30 nm after 30
h. It is believed that the formation of the NPs was completed at the
early hours of the synthesis, but as the time progresses, NPs tend
to aggregate in number, resulting in larger-sized particles. To get
more detailed information about the NP growth, the formed NPs were
investigated with SEM, TEM, and dynamic light scattering (DLS), as
shown in Figures 1–4. Investigations showed that NPs were spherical
with a size range of about 30 ± 10 nm after 5 h. Although size
measurements showed that the size of NPs increased as a function of
time, morphological investigations proved that NPs of 30 ± 10
nm in size underwent secondary aggregation and resulted in NP growth
as a function of time. Attempts to disperse the aggregated NPs using
ultrasound were not successful in dispersing the NPs. It can be concluded
that NPs grow up to 5 h and undergo secondary aggregations when the
reaction was allowed to continue (Scheme 2). On the other hand, synthesis with PVP
is a two-step process: (1) transformation of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O into cerium hydroxide, and (2) calcination
of cerium hydroxide into CeO2 NPs at 600 °C for 2
h. The precursor ions (Ce3+) react with the hydroxyl ions
(OH·) from NaOH and form cerium hydroxide NPs (Ce(OH)4) as an intermediate compound, which, upon calcination under
atmospheric conditions, oxidizes into CeO2 NPs.16 The NPs were spherical, and the size was found
to be about 20 ± 10 nm. Notably, NPs synthesized with HMT and
PVP showed a surface potential of +27.6 and −32.9 mV, respectively
(Figure 5). The surface
potential of greater than ±25 mV along with a sharp single peak
indicated that the NPs formed were monodispersed and stable. In the
PVP-assisted process, the calcination at 600 °C resulted in the
removal of PVP from the NPs. Hence, the monodispersity and the controlled
size of the NPs were approximated due to the accumulation of sodium
nitrate (NaNO3) ions onto the surface of NPs.39

Growth Mechanism
in HMT-Assisted Synthesis Process
To get more detailed information about the NP formation,
phases
present, and crystallinity, the synthesized NPs were characterized
with UV–Vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, and XRD. UV–Vis investigations
show that both NPs revealed strong absorption peaks in the range between
280 and 300 nm, which is a specific characteristic peak of cerium
oxide NPs (Figure 6). It was reported that a red shift in the absorption peak of PVP-stabilized
CeO2 NPs was influenced by the quantity of Ce3+/Ce4+ present in the NPs.40 XRD investigations confirmed that the XRD patterns of synthesized
NPs matched well with the standard patterns of cerium oxide NPs (JCPDS
card no. 34-0394), as shown in Figure 8. Notably, XRD peaks of the negatively charged particles
were sharp, which elucidated that the formed particles were precisely
crystalline and also in accordance with the cubic fluorite structure
of CeO2 NPs with miller indices (111), (200), (220), (311),
(222), (400), (331), and (420) at 28.5°, 33.08°, 47.47°,
56.3°, 69.4°, 76.7°, and 79.07°, respectively,
whereas the XRD patterns of positively charged particles also included
peaks of secondary structures of cerium oxide (JCPDS card no. 23-1048).
These variations in the structures of the NPs were believed due to
heat treatment of the NPs during the synthesis process. The negatively
charged NPs were calcined at higher temperatures (600 °C), which
aided the NPs to be more crystalline, whereas the positively charged
NPs were only exposed to low temperatures (50–60 °C),
which paved a way to form secondary structures.

3.2 Investigation of Positively and Negatively
Charged CeO2 NPs on Growth and Development of Drosophila melanogaster
The positively charged
NPs did not elicit any morphological alterations and delay in the
growth of Drosophila. The length and breadth of the
larvae from this treatment group were comparable to those of the control
group, without any statistical significance. Both the control and
positively charged treatment groups became third instars at the same
time, and new flies were observed simultaneously. Moreover, the crawling
activity of the larvae was also not affected. However, the larvae
that fed on food containing negatively charged NPs exhibited morphological
alterations and decreased crawling speed. Since there are no previous
in vivo studies with charged CeO2 NPs to correlate the
findings of the present study, more studies are warranted to further
investigate how the surface charge of CeO2 NPs elicits
delayed development in Drosophila. However, based
on the available literature regarding the effect of surface charge
of NPs and its uptake and toxicity, it can be postulated that the
delayed development observed in larvae that fed on food containing
negatively charged NPs could be due to decreased cell–NP interaction,
and subsequently, it reduced cellular uptake of food ingredients along
with the NPs, and thereby, no degradation was observed (Figure 10). El Badawy et
al. reported that in Gram-positive bacteria, a strong cell–NP
repulsion was observed due to the presence of a negative charge on
the cell membrane of bacillus cells and negatively charged citrate-capped
silver NPs. With positively charged NPs, the repulsion decreased and
cell–NP interaction increased.41 Moreover, it has been reported that compared to neutrally charged
iron oxide NPs (coated with PEG), positively charged iron oxide NPs
(coated with polyethylenimine) exhibited enhanced cellular uptake,
faster blood clearance, and dose-dependent cytotoxicity.42 A study performed in pregnant mice also reported
that compared to negatively charged iron oxide NPs, iron oxide NPs
coated with positively charged polyethylenimine exhibited increased
bioaccumulation of iron in the fetal liver,43 suggesting the preferential uptake of positively charged NPs by
cells. As toxicity is based on NP localization in the cell, positively
and negatively charged NPs are taking different routes to reach the
lysosome and cytoplasm, respectively. Notably, toxicity was high for
positively charged NPs localized at the lysosome than that of negatively
charged NPs localized at the cytoplasm. Investigation of CeO2 NPs in cancer cells showed that positively charged NPs were toxic
to all cancer cells except breast cancer cells because of its localization
in lysosomes, whereas negatively charged NPs were toxic only to A459
lung cancer cells. Interestingly, neutrally charged cerium oxide NPs
also accumulated in the cytoplasm and induced no cytotoxicity to both
normal and cancer cells. Since the larvae that fed on negatively charged
NPs exhibited delayed development, it is believed that the negatively
charged CeO2 NPs were internalized by larval cells. Previous
reports claimed that although positively charged NPs favored protein
adsorption, NPs were not effectively internalized in A459 lung cancer
cells and induced no cytotoxicity. In the present study, we did not
observe any phenotypic defects in the body parts of adult flies that
hatched from third instar larvae, such as head, eyes, wings, legs,
and abdomen, for both the positively and negatively charged groups.
This is in accordance with the results of a previous study, except
for scutellar bristles, using negatively charged CeO2 NPs
with a zeta potential of −18.2 mV.23 Although the authors mentioned the lack of toxicity up to a dose
of 10 mM, there is no mention of any delayed development of the larvae,
and the results obtained in our study shed a new dimension on the
effect of negative surface charge. This might be due to the difference
in the approach used to synthesize negatively charged CeO2 NPs and, more importantly, the inability to biodegrade the negatively
charged CeO2. Since the positively charged CeO2 NPs did not elicit any developmental delay and favored BSA adsorption,
it is proposed to use the positively charged CeO2 NPs at
a dose of 0.1 mM in future studies as a drug delivery agent. On the
other hand, negatively charged NPs were internalized effectively and
resulted in delayed growth for about a week. Hence, the current study
has provided important information regarding the effect of surface
charge of CeO2 NPs on the growth and development of Drosophila.

4 Conclusions
We synthesized
positively and negatively charged CeO2 NPs by co-precipitation
method using HMT and PVP, respectively,
as precipitating agents. Positively charged NPs of about 30 ±
10 nm in size tend to aggregate in number, resulting in larger-sized
NPs as a function of time. The addition of PVP into the solution of
cerium nitrate at basic pH resulted in negatively charged CeO2 NPs after calcination at 600 °C. The nitrates formed
from the reaction tend to mask the negatively charged NPs and prevent
them from agglomeration, resulting in spherical monodispersed NPs
of about 20 ± 10 nm in size. Negatively charged CeO2 NPs are precisely crystalline and arranged in the cubic fluorite
structure of cerium oxide. The positively charged NPs do not affect
the growth and development of Drosophila and can
be used in future studies as a drug delivery agent. The negatively
charged NPs caused a delay in larve development by 1 week, due to
its non-degradable nature. The detailed mechanistic insights in the
uptake process of NPs resulting from the current study will be highly
valuable for the design of drug delivery systems for the treatment
of Alzheimer’s disease.

hydroxide (NaOH), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), d-glucose,
and yeast extract powder were purchased from SRL Pvt. Ltd., India.
Agar-agar type I, propionic acid, methyl parahydroxybenzoate, and
orthophosphoric acid were purchased from HiMedia (Mumbai), Merck Life
Sciences (Mumbai), Rankem (New Delhi), and Thermo Fischer Scientific
(Mumbai), respectively. All chemicals were of analytical grade and
used as received. Milli-Q water with a resistivity of >18.2 MΩ·cm
was used for all experiments.

5.2 Synthesis
of CeO2 NPs
Positively charged CeO2 NPs were synthesized as reported
previously via aqueous precipitation method using HMT.17 Briefly, 100 mL of 0.1 M solutions of cerium
nitrate hexahydrate and HMT were separately prepared in water. Later,
HMT solution was added drop by drop into cerium nitrate hexahydrate
solution under stirring (Scheme 3). This mixture was left for 30 h at room temperature
under continuous stirring at 400 rpm. At predetermined time points,
2 mL of the sample was withdrawn, washed with Milli-Q water, and investigated
in DLS. After completion of the reaction, the suspension was centrifuged
at 9000 rpm for 20 min and washed five times with water. Finally,
the formed pellet was dried overnight in an oven at 50 °C to
obtain CeO2 NPs.

Charged CeO2 NPs by Reducing Ce(NO3)3 with HMT
Negatively charged
CeO2 NPs were synthesized by aqueous
precipitation of cerium nitrate hexahydrate using PVP.16 Briefly, 100 mL of 0.4 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH),
100 mL of 0.1 M cerium nitrate hexahydrate, and 2 mL of 10% PVP solutions
were prepared separately in water. The original procedure was modified
slightly to obtain monodispersed stable NPs. In the original procedure,
cerium nitrate solution was added drop by drop to the mixture of PVP
and NaOH solution, which resulted in microparticles of about 10–50
μm in size.16 In the present work,
NaOH solution was first added drop by drop to 100 mL of 0.1 M cerium
nitrate hexahydrate solution under stirring at 1000 rpm, followed
by the addition of 2 mL of PVP solution. After 1 h of reaction, a
yellow-colored precipitate was observed, which was due to the formation
of cerium hydroxide NPs. This precipitate was centrifuged at 10,000
rpm for 20 min and washed with Milli-Q water and ethanol (5–10
times) to remove any leftover reactants. The pellet was dried for
24 h at 60 °C and calcined at 600 °C for 2 h to oxidize
cerium hydroxide particles into CeO2 NPs.

5.3 Fly Strains and Culture
The wild-type Drosophila strain (Oregon K) was used in this study. They
were reared at 25 ± 1 °C, 60% humidity, and a 12 h dark-light
cycle on a standard cornmeal diet consisting of corn flour, d-glucose, sugar, agar-agar type 1, and yeast extract powder. Antifungal
agents such as propionic acid, methyl paraben, and orthophosphoric
acid were added to the cornmeal diet at 55 °C after autoclaving
to prevent the growth of fungus.

5.4 Experimental
Setup for Biological Studies
The experimental setup consisted
of three series of control, 0.1
mM, and 1 mM of both positively charged (denoted as “A”)
and negatively charged (denoted as “B”) CeO2 NPs/mL of food in vials, each containing 6 mL of the cornmeal agar.
An aqueous dispersion of CeO2 NPs (30 mM) in Milli-Q water
was prepared by sonication in a water bath to obtain a uniform dispersion.
The stock dispersion was diluted to obtain the desired concentrations
and added to the food. After 24 h, 25 female and 10 male flies were
each transferred to the vials for mating and discarded after 48 h.
The third instar larvae that emerged from such food vials were used
for the studies.

5.5 Stereoscopic Microscopy
To assess
the effect of CeO2 NPs on larval growth and development,
third instar larvae from the control and positively charged CeO2 NPs treated groups were observed under a stereomicroscope
to observe for defects in growth and development. For the negatively
charged CeO2 NPs group, photos of larvae were taken before
and after they reached the third instar stage. Briefly, three larvae
from each vial were immobilized on ice, and their images were taken
under a stereomicroscope at 20× magnification. The length and
breadth of the larvae were measured, and statistical analysis was
performed to assess the significant differences between the groups.
The phenotype of flies that hatched from the third instar larvae was
also observed for any phenotypic changes.

5.6 Larval
Crawling Assay
The larval
crawling assay was performed based on a previously described method.44 Nine third instar larvae from the control and
treatment groups were collected, washed with 1× PBS to remove
any food traces, and transferred onto a glass Petri plate coated with
2% agarose. The larvae were allowed to crawl on the agarose surface
placed over a graph sheet three times and were filmed. The number
of grid lines crossed in 1 min was counted, and the mean distance
covered for each group of nine larvae (mm/min) was calculated.

5.7 Characterization
5.7.1 UV-Vis Spectroscopy
A small amount
of the as-prepared NP powder was dispersed in water and used to obtain
the UV–Vis absorption spectra of the CeO2 NPs in
a Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–750
nm.

5.7.2 Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy
A mixture of CeO2 NP powder and KBr powder was made
into pellets (10 mg of powder/100 mg of KBr) and used for obtaining
its FT-IR absorption spectrum in ATR mode on a Bruker ALPHA FT-IR
spectrometer in the range of 400–4000 cm–1.

5.7.3 Zeta Potential Studies
A dilute
NP suspension prepared by dispersing NPs in water under ultrasonication
was used to measure their size and zeta potential using a zetasizer
(Nano-ZS, Malvern Instruments).

5.7.4 X-ray
Diffraction (XRD) Studies
To perform XRD, CeO2 NP powder was exposed to Cu Kα
radiation with a wavelength (λ) of 1.5408 Å in the 2θ
range of 20–100° using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro
X-ray diffractometer. The obtained diffraction peaks were compared
with the standard JCPDS database.

5.7.5 Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM)
A dilute NP suspension prepared
by dispersing NPs in water under
ultrasonication was placed on a silicon wafer and air-dried overnight
to completely remove any moisture. After sputter coating with a thin
layer of gold, the samples were analyzed using a Quanta 200 FEG scanning
electron microscope operating at 5 kV to investigate the size, shape,
and morphology of the NPs.

5.7.6 Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM)
For sample preparation, 4 μL of dilute
NP suspension was
placed on carbon-coated copper grids and air-dried overnight to completely
remove the moisture. Control NPs and larvae fed with NP-containing
cornmeal were imaged under JEOL TEM 2100 Plus (Japan) at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV. For larvae gut imaging, third instar larvae from
the control and treatment groups were collected and washed with 1×
PBS to remove any food traces, and then, their guts were dissected
and a portion of these were transferred onto copper grids for air
drying.

5.8 Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0, followed by Dunnett’s
post-test to compare the significance of treatment groups with control.
Significance was set to P < 0.05. The values expressed
are mean ± SEM.
