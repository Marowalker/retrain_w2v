Methuosis
is a form of nonapoptotic cell death characterized by
the accumulation of macropinosome-derived vacuoles. Herein, we identify
PIKFYVE, a class III phosphoinositide (PI) kinase, as the protein
target responsible for the methuosis-inducing activity of indolyl-pyridinyl-propenones
(3-(5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one).
We further characterize the effects of chemical substitutions at the
2- and 5-indolyl positions on cytoplasmic vacuolization and PIKFYVE
binding and inhibitory activity. Our study provides a better understanding
of the mechanism of methuosis-inducing indolyl-pyridinyl-propenones.

Introduction
Methuosis is a form
of nonapoptotic cell death triggered by alterations
in the trafficking of clathrin-independent endosomes and is associated
with vacuolization of macropinosome and endosome compartments.1 Methuosis was initially defined in glioblastoma
cells expressing activated Ras,2 but several
studies have reported the features of methuosis in a broad spectrum
of cancer cells including gastric carcinoma cells and osteosarcoma
cells.3,4 The vacuoles generated during methuosis
are distinct from autophagosomes and show characteristics of enlarged
macropinosomes. Vacuolated cells eventually undergo caspase-independent
cell death initiated by the dysregulation of micropinocytosis.2

Previous investigations found that indolyl-pyridinyl-propenones
(also referred to as indole-based chalcones) trigger methuosis.5 Specifically, 3-(5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propene-1-one (MOMIPP) was
identified as an initial exemplar tool compound. Follow-up structure–activity
relationship (SAR) studies defined key features associated with three
phenotypic classifications, namely, the induction of methuosis, vacuolization
without cell death,6 and disruption of
microtubules leading to apoptosis.7 Selected
substitutions on the indole at position 2 or moving the methoxy group
from position 5 to 68 redirected the mode
of cytotoxicity from distinctive methuosis to microtubule disruption
with little observable effect on vacuoles. However, the protein target(s)
of the compounds that prompt the methuosis phenotype have not been
identified. In this study, we identified PIKFYVE, a class III phosphoinositide
(PI) kinase, as at least one candidate protein that when inhibited
triggers vacuolization, a hallmark of methuosis.

PI homeostasis
is tightly regulated because the spatiotemporal
restriction of different PI species is crucial for membrane trafficking
within both the secretory and endocytic pathways.9,10 Disruption
of endosome or macropinosome trafficking has been shown to induce
cellular vacuolization.11 PI synthesis
involves phosphorylating/dephosphorylating positions D3, D4, and/or
D5 of their inositol ring by various lipid kinases and phosphatases.10 Accordingly, the inhibition of select lipid
kinases or phosphatases by
chemical or genetic perturbation can induce cellular vacuolization.12,13

Results and Discussion
To explore whether indolyl-pyridinyl-propenones
disrupt PI homeostasis
by inhibiting a specific inositol kinase or phosphatase, we used a
competition binding assay to quantitatively measure interactions between
the lead compound MOMIPP and 22 inositol kinases including clinically
relevant mutants (Table 1). The competition binding assay showed that at 10 μM, MOMIPP
competes away all binding of inositol kinases PIKFYVE and PIP5K1C
as compared to the control.

a MOMIPP (10 μM ) was used for
the competition. Data are shown as % control, where lower numbers
indicate more competition between the control compound and MOMIPP.
% control was calculated as follows. (MOMIPP signal – positive
control signal)/(negative control signal – positive control
signal) × 100. Negative control = DMSO (100% control); positive
control = control compound that binds specifically to each kinase
(0% control).

To further
assess the binding potency and specificity, we calculated
binding constants (Kd) against PIKFYVE
and PIP5K1C with a standard dose–response curve (Figure 1). In this assay, MOMIPP exhibited
a Kd of 5.3 nM against PIKFYVE, whereas
the Kd against PIP5K1C was >15 000
nM, suggesting that MOMIPP specifically binds PIKFYVE with strong
potency. Because previous SAR studies7 of
methuosis-inducing activity resulted in three classes of indolyl-pyridinyl-propenones
with distinct cellular phenotypes, we synthesized compounds from each
class to confirm cellular phenotypes and characterize PIKFYVE inhibition
(Table 2).

Figure 1 Lipid kinase

interactions were quantitated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) that detects
the associated DNA label on each kinase as described in the Experimental Section. The amount of kinase measured
by qPCR is plotted against the corresponding MOMIPP concentration.
Binding constants (Kd) were calculated
with a standard dose–response curve using the Hill equation12 as follows. Response = background + (signal
– background)/(1 + (KdHill slope)/(doseHill slope)). The Hill slope was set to −1.

As previously characterized,7 class
1 compounds (2a, 2c) induced cellular vacuolization
without causing cell death, class 2 compounds (1a; MOMIPP, 2b) induced cellular vacuolization and cell death via methuosis,
and class 3 compounds (2l) induced cell death without
showing distinct cellular vacuolization, consistent with prior reports
of tubulin modulation (Figures 2, 3, and summarized in Table 2). To explore the correlation
between the cellular vacuolization phenotype and the binding activity
against PIKFYVE, we calculated binding constants (Kd) against PIKFYVE with a standard dose–response
curve.

Figure 3 Vacuolization phenotype of compounds and its
correlation to the
PIKFYVE binding activity. Phase contrast images of live cells were
obtained at 2 and 24 h after compound treatment as described in the Experimental Section at 40× magnification.
The PIKFYVE binding assay with each compound was performed as described.

In this assay, class 1 compounds
(2a, 2c) exhibited Kd of 23 and 51 nM, respectively,
and class 2 compounds (1a; MOMIPP, 2b) exhibited Kd of 6.9 and 6.5 nM, respectively, whereas the Kd of class 3 compound (2l) was
>500 nM. The Kd of free acid compound
(2o) was 46 nM (Figure 3 and summarized in Table 2). These results show that compounds with
the cellular vacuolization phenotype (class 1 and 2) strongly bind
PIKFYVE. Compounds with carboxylic acid substitutions at R2 (class 3) do not show the cellular vacuolization phenotype. Compound 2l, a tubulin modulator,7 displays
a weak binding activity against PIKFYVE but triggers cell death. The
related compound (2o) binds PIKFYVE with strong in vitro
potency but likely loses the cellular activity because of the limited
cellular permeability.

PIKFYVE is a 240 kD lipid kinase that
phosphorylates the D-5 position
in endosomal phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) to yield 3,5-bisphosphate
(PI(3,5)P2).14 To determine whether MOMIPP
directly inhibits the PIKFYVE kinase activity, we performed an in
vitro kinase assay with the purified PIKFYVE full-length protein.
MOMIPP potently inhibited the PIKFYVE kinase activity (IC50 = 5.05 nM), whereas the class 3 compound (2l) had a
reduced activity (IC50 = 446 nM) toward PIKFYVE (Figure 4). This result is
consistent with the PIKFYVE binding assay where MOMIPP showed a stronger
binding activity (Kd = 6.9 nM) in comparison
to the class 3 compound (2l) (Kd = 540 nM) (Figure 3 and Table 2).

Figure 4 PIKFYVE inhibition by MOMIPP. The PIKFYVE inhibitory activity by
compounds 1a (MOMIPP) and 2l was measured
as described in the Experimental Section.
Data are shown as percent inhibition of kinase activity calculated
from the percent conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine
diphosphate (ADP).

The genetic manipulation
of PIKFYVE with CRISPR (clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats)-mediated genome editing (Figure 5A) and chemical perturbation
of PIKFYVE activity using apilimod (Figure 5B) also showed similar vacuolization. These
results effectively demonstrate that MOMIPP and its analogues (class
1 and class 2 compounds) trigger cellular vacuolization by inhibiting
the PIKFYVE kinase activity.

treatment. (A) Phase contrast images of HCT116 cells stably expressing
scrambled single-guide RNA (sgRNA) or sgRNA targeting PIKFYVE. (B)
Phase contrast images of HCT116 cells treated with DMSO or 5 nM PIKFYVE

In conclusion, we showed that MOMIPP binds PIKFYVE and inhibits
its kinase activity. The preliminary SAR study effectively demonstrates
that the binding and inhibitory activity of MOMIPP analogues against
PIKFYVE determines their biological activity in cellular vacuolization,
which is a hallmark of methuosis.1 The
cytotoxic activity of MOMIPP (1a) and 2b may have additional target(s) and has unique pleiotropic effects
on cells that lead to metabolic collapse and cell death.6 We showed that the inhibition of the PIKFYVE
kinase activity results in cellular vacuolization, which is a contributing
factor to methuosis.

PIKFYVE has also been reported to regulate
TLR (toll-like receptor)-induced
IL-12/23 expression by modulating PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 levels, and
dysregulated TLR signaling can lead to autoimmune diseases such as
Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis.13 Our study suggests that MOMIPP might be an important
tool to study the function of the PIKFYVE lipid kinase activity in
various biological processes including the TLR pathway regulation
in IL-12/23-mediated diseases as well as methuosis.

Experimental
Section
General Chemistry
All commercially available solvents
(VWR and Fisher) and compounds (Fluka, Lancaster, Aldrich) were used
as received. Compounds were synthesized according to the reported
experimental procedures (Supporting Information).7 NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker
AV 400 spectrometer in the solvents indicated. Chemical shifts (δ)
are given in ppm relative to trimethylsilane. All coupling constants
(J) are reported in hertz. The data are reported
as follows: chemical shift, intergration, and multiplicity (s = singlet,
d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, and b = broad
peak). High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed using
electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive ion mode after separation
by liquid chromatography (Nexera from Shimadzu). The elemental composition
was derived from the mass spectra acquired at the high resolution
of about 30 000 on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific). The high mass accuracy below 1 ppm was obtained by using
a lock mass. Preparatory silica gel chromatography was performed on
a CombiFlash Rf 200 (Teledyne ISCO) flash chromatography system with
RediSep Rf normal phase silica gel (25–70 μm) columns
and 254 nm UV detection.

To determine the chemical purity of
final compounds, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis was performed. An ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (1.8
μm; 2.1 × 100 mm) and a mobile phase (0.8 mL/min flow rate)
were used with the following composition: eluent A (water + 0.05%
formic acid + 3.75 mM acetic acid), eluent B (acetonitrile + 0.04%
formic acid), with gradient elution from 5 to 98% eluent B. HPLC was
performed at 60 °C. As determined by HPLC, all compounds were
of 95% or of a greater purity. Mass spectra were obtained with a Finnigan
MAT 8200 (70 eV) spectrometer with an ESI-MS source: Finnigan MAT
95 for accurate mass determination. The mass spectra (m/z) were recorded using ESI.

liganded affinity beads, and test compounds. After binding, DNA-tagged
kinases were eluted and each kinase concentration in the eluates was
measured by qPCR of DNA tag on each kinase.

Cell Viability Assay
Cells were plated into each well
of Greiner 384-well plates at a density of 1500 cells/well. The cells
were incubated with increasing concentration of compounds (0.1% v/v
DMSO) for 72 h, and cell viability was measured by an EnVison plate
reader (PerkinElmer) with CellTiter-Glo (Promega).

Cell Morphology
For acquisition of phase contrast images
of live cells, HCT116 cells were seeded on a 384-well high-content
imaging microplate. Next day, the compounds were added and images
were obtained at the indicated time after the addition of compounds
using an EVOS FL Cell Imaging System (Life Technologies, Paisley,
UK).

PIKFYVE Inhibition Assay
The kinase inhibition assay
was performed using an ADP-Glo system (Promega) according to the manufacturer
protocol. Briefly, the kinase reaction was performed by adding the
active PIKFYVE protein (SignalChem), lipid substrate PI(3)P (SignalChem),
protein kinase C lipid activator (SignalChem), and 50 μM ATP
(SignalChem) in kinase buffer (25 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 12.5 mM β-glycerol-phosphate,
25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM egtazic acid, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, and 0.25 mM dithiothreitol). The reaction was terminated by
adding the ADP-Glo reagent (Promega). The ATP–ADP conversion
was quantitated by adding the kinase detection reagent (Promega) and
reading the luminescence signal with the plate reader (EnVision).

PIKFYVE KnockOut
Pooled PIKFYVE-/- cells were generated using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout. HCT116
cells stably expressing Cas9 were transduced with lentivirus containing
sgRNA against PIKFYVE. sgRNA with a scrambled sequence
was used as a control.
