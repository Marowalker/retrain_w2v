Colonic
amyloidosis is the result of overexpression of the serum
amyloid A (SAA) protein in inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer.
Crucial for amyloid formation are the first ten N-terminal residues,
which in the crystal structure are a part of a 27-residue long helix.
Here, we study this 27-residue N-terminal region of SAA by a multiexchange
variant of replica exchange molecular dynamics. An ensemble of configurations
is observed, dominated by three motifs: the single helix of the crystal
structure, a helix-turn-helix configurations, and such where the residues
14–27 are the part of a helix but the first 13 residues form
an extended and disordered segment that is prone to aggregation. The
single point mutation E9A shifts the equilibrium to the latter motif,
indicating the importance of interactions involving this residue for
the stability of the SAA protein.

Introduction
A large spectrum of
diseases is connected with the presence of
amyloid fibrils that after staining with Congo red are visible under
ultraviolet light. Depending on the specific disease, these deposits
are either systemic or localized (for instance, in the patient’s
brain in the case of Alzheimer’s disease), and appear either
spontaneous or as the consequence or byproduct of another disease.1−5 An example for the latter, so-called secondary, amyloidosis is colonic
amyloidosis where in response to inflammation the precursor protein
serum amyloid A (SAA) is overexpressed.6 Normally, SAA is found with a concentration of 1–3 μg/mL
in human blood, but in patients with colon cancer or inflammatory
bowel disease the concentration of SAA can approach more than 1 mg/mL.
This extremely high concentration then encourages misfolding and aggregation
of SAA, leading to the outbreak of colonic amyloidosis as a secondary
disease that adds to the symptoms of the primary disease.7−9

SAA is built out of 104 amino acids; however, in extracellular
environment, or in amyloids, one does not find the complete protein
but rather the truncated fragment SAA (1–76). The structure
of the full-size protein has been resolved by X-ray crystallography10 and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
under identifier 4IP8. However the crystal structure, shown in Figure 1, is for a hexamer, it is stable for the
monomer, and characterized by a long C-terminal tail that wraps four
helices corresponding to residues 1–27, 32–47, 50–69,
and 73–88.10

Figure 1 Crystal structure (PDB
ID: 4IP8) of
the full-size SAA monomer. The purple
segment is helix I (residues 1–27). Helix II, III, and IV and
the C-terminal tail, consisting of residues 28–104, are drawn
in yellow. Labels mark the N- and C-terminals.

From mutation experiments, it is known that the first eleven
residues
are crucial for the misfolding and aggregation of SAA in colonic amyloidosis
as their lacking prevents the aggregation of SAA.11 In the crystal structure, these residues are part of the
N-terminal α-helix, but it was proposed by Nordling and Abraham-Nordling12 that residues 1–13 can misfold into a
β-hairpin structure whose presence will trigger aggregation.
This idea is consistent with Jannone’s observation of Raman
spectra seen during SAA (1–12) aggregation,13 and our own simulations which show an equilibrium between
α-helix to β-hairpin configurations for the N-terminal
segment SAA (1–13) that can be shifted by various single-point
mutations.14

A drawback of our previous
study is that it considered only an
isolated segment formed by residues 1–13. However, in the crystal
structure these residues are part of an α-helix spanning from
residue 1–27. The local environment formed by this α-helix
will likely alter the landscape of the 1–13 segment and the
mechanism of the helix-hairpin transition. Such “caching”
of residues prone to form β-strands has been also observed for
other proteins.15 Note that the stabilizing
effect of the other three helices seems to be weak as we observe already
in rather short molecular dynamics simulation (40 ns at 310 K), an
unraveling of the N-terminal segment for the full-size protein (see Figure S1). For this reason, we extend here our
previous study to the segment formed by the first 27 residues of SAA,
investigating its structural transitions, and their potential role
in the formation of SAA amyloids. For this purpose, we consider not
only the wild type, but probe also how landscape and transition mechanism
are altered by the mutation of residue 9 from a glutamic acid into
an alanine (E9A). However this mutant has not been observed in vivo,
it was chosen by us to test the role of a potentially helix-stabilizing
salt bridge seen in the wild type at neutral pH (a slat bridge that
disappears under acidic conditions known to further amyloid formation).
Our results rely on large-scale simulations using a variant replica
exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), multiexchange REMD (ME-REMD).
This variant raises the efficiency of regular REMD by attempting multiple
exchanges of neighboring replicas between the molecular dynamic segments.
An additional goal of this paper is to evaluate in a systematic way
the gain in efficiency by this approach.

Results and Discussion
System
Setup
In the present study, we use molecular
dynamics simulations to investigate structural transitions in the
N-terminal segment SAA (1–27), a protein implicated in colonic
amyloidosis. In order to ensure validity of our results, we have to
make certain that the set-up of our simulation does not introduce
a bias to our data. Such bias could come, for instance, from a too
small simulation box that would cage the molecule and therefore restrict
its configurational space. In Figure S2, we present results from short constant temperature (400 K) simulations
of the wild-type fragment SAA (1–27) for cubic boxes of length
4.8, 5.4, and 5.6 nm. Shown is the probability of a residue to be
part of a helix, strand, or turn. Comparing the results, we find that
the results from box sizes 5.4 and 5.6 nm are consistent, but differ
from that of box size 4.8 nm. Hence, we conclude that a box size of
atleast 5.4 nm is necessary in simulations to minimize the finite
size effects.

In a similar way, we need to make sure that the
temperature distribution allows a walk of replicas through temperature
space, and that the highest temperature is sufficiently large to enable
crossing of all relevant barriers in the system. The lowest temperature
is given by our target temperature, T = 300 K. Short
constant temperature runs indicate that a temperature of T = 420 K is sufficient to dissolve the helix, and for this reason
we choose T = 420 K as our maximal temperature. The
distribution of temperatures between the two extremes can be determined
for a given number of replicas by the algorithm of van der Spoel.16 Especially, we find that 36 replicas lead to
an average acceptance probability of 18%, which we consider acceptable.
Simulating the wild type with this box size and temperature distribution
for 300 ns, and evaluating various quantities, such as the secondary
structure probability of certain segments, for different time intervals,
we find that a regular REMD simulation converges within 200 ns. Hence,
this set-up for regular REMD (see Figure S3) is used as our standard against which we compare all considered
variants when testing the efficiency of ME-REMD.

Comparing the
Efficiency of REMD and ME-REMD Sampling
REMD is a method
to enhance sampling of configurations in systems
where large barriers in the energy landscape lead to slow sampling.
REMD alleviates this problem by introducing a walk through temperature
space. At high temperatures, barriers can be easily crossed, whereas
at low temperatures more relevant low-energy configurations are explored.
A disadvantage of this technique is that the temperature spacing decreases
with increasing system size (or otherwise the acceptance for exchange
moves becomes vanishingly small). This makes simulations of proteins
in explicit water (i.e., where the system consists of the protein
and a much larger number of water molecules) cumbersome. One way to
raise the effective transition rate is to attempt multiple exchanges
between two neighboring replicas.17 As
a consequence, a given replica can cover a large range of temperatures
between two molecular dynamics segments if a series of exchange attempts
between pairs of neighboring replicas are made, resulting in a faster
walk in temperature space. However it appears reasonable to assume
that such an approach will lead to improved sampling, it is important
to explore systematically the gain in efficiency that can be obtained,
and how this gain depends on the number of such exchange attempts
within one exchange cycle.

Hence, in a first step we took our
system of 36 replicas, which we had simulated with regular REMD; and
varied the number N of exchange attempts. Specifically,
we considered the cases N = 1 (regular REMD), 5,
10, 20, and up to N = 100. The resulting effective
exchange rates for the various temperature pairs are shown in Figure 2a. These rates suggest
a fast approach to an optimum, with increasing the number of attempts
beyond N = 10 not raising the effective exchange
rate further in a noticeable way. Here, we define the effective exchange
rate by the number of times where, after the series of N exchanges, the final and initial configurations of a replica differ.
As a consequence of the higher exchange rate, replicas walk faster
in temperature space. This can be seen in Table 1 where we list the number of tunneling events
and average tunneling times for various N. Here,
we define a tunneling event as the walk of a replica through the temperature
space, from the lowest temperature to the highest temperature and
back, see Figure 2c,d
for illustration. Note in Table 1, the much faster walk in temperature space with ME-REMD
is seen than for regular REMD.

the same temperature interval of 200–420 K; for comparison
we also show the regular REMD simulation of the 36-replica system.
A typical replica walking in temperature space is shown in (C) for
regular REMD (36 replica); and in (D) for the 28-replica ME-REMD simulation.

One possible
application of the increased effective exchange rates
and faster walk in temperature space is the possibility to use ME-REMD
with a smaller number of replicas than needed for regular REMD. Varying
the number of replicas in the same temperature interval of T = 300 K to T = 420 K from M = 36 to M = 28, we measured again for various numbers N of exchange attempts the resulting effective exchange
rates, and plot these in Figure 2b. As in the case of M = 36 replicas,
the effective exchange rate approaches an optimum for N ≈ 10. For M = 28, replicas correspond this
optimal effective exchange rate to the one seen when the original
system (M = 36) is simulated with regular REMD. In
a similar way, the number of tunneling events agree with average tunneling
times, see Table 1.
For illustration, we show both the 36 REMD and the 28 ME-REMD simulations
example walks of replicas through temperature space in Figure 2c,d. Hence, by using ME-REMD
instead of regular REMD we reduce the number of replicas in our system
from M = 36 to M = 28 replicas,
a reduction of computational resources by more than 20%!

Various
approaches have been proposed in the past that result into
faster walks through temperature space. In some cases, these approaches
lead to biased sampling and nonreliable results. In order to exclude
this possibility, we compare in Figure 3 the secondary structure propensity of the residues
as measured with regular REMD for our original system of M = 36 replicas, with the data measured in our ME-REMD simulation
of the system with M = 28 replicas. In both cases,
we find a propensity for the formation of α-helices of about
50%, 51% for ME-REMD, and 55% for REMD, and substantial propensity
for turn and β-strand formation, see the left and middle panel
of Figure 3. In both
REMD and ME-REMD results, we observed that the wild-type SAA (1–27)
fragment has a tendency for the helix to break around residue 11–13.
The qualitative and quantitative similarity between the two runs shows
that the enhanced sampling in ME-REMD does not introduce any biases
into our simulation; and for our further analysis we therefore rely
on the data obtained with ME-REMD sampling.

in the upper panel, with blue balls marking the N terminal of the

Configurational Ensemble
of SAA (1–27) Monomers
However in the crystal structure
of ref (11), all 27
residues form an α-helix, the
helix propensity is reduced in our simulations, with a break of the
helix around residues 11–13. These results are consistent with
previous experiments, showing that the truncation of the first eleven
residues can prevent aggregation. Our data indicate three regions:
helix Ia (residue 1–11), turn (residue 12–13), and helix
Ib (residue 14–27). As the first segment, residues 1–11
have a lower helicity than the segment formed by residues 14–27,
it follows that the helix Ia is less stable than helix Ib, and its
presence or lack of therefore may well be the key enabling aggregation.

The secondary structure propensity distribution is consistent with
our clustering analysis where we group configurations according to
the secondary structure propensity of residues 1–11 and 14–21
(residues 22–27 are always helical and therefore ignored for
clustering). We find three main clusters. The first cluster is made
of configurations with a helix-turn-helix hairpin, with atleast five
consecutive residues in each of the two segments identified as helical,
but separated by atleast two residues that are not helical. The second
cluster is made of configurations with a stable helix Ib (again defined
by the requirement of atleast five helical residues in the segment
14–21), but where the N-terminal residues 1–11 form
an elongated, disordered, and dynamically changing segment (with no
more than three consecutive helical residues). Finally, the configurations
in the third cluster are characterized by single long helices, resembling
the crystal structure for this fragment, and are defined by the requirement
of a single helix of at least 14 residues covering both segments.
Example configurations are shown in the upper level of the left and
middle panel of Figure 3. The helix-turn-helix cluster has the largest population and contains
about 33% of all configurations. The second largest group is the disordered
N-terminal cluster consisting of about 25% of configurations. The
lowest frequency (5%) is seen for configurations with the native structure-like
single extended helix. The various frequencies are listed in Table 2.

The above results raise the question on what
breaks the extended
helix seen in the crystal structure, what leads to the dominance of
the helix-turn-helix hairpin motif, and how is this all connected
to the role of the first 11 residues in amyloid formation of SAA?
Residue 13 is a glycine and residue 14 is an alanine, and both residues
make it likely to break the helix in this segment. Residue 11 is a
phenylalanine whose aromatic sidechain may form a weak hydrophobic
contact with residue 21Y to break the extended helix motif and stabilize
the helix-turn-helix motif, shown in Figure 4B. Residue 12 is an aspartic acid, and Figure 4A,B indicates that
there is a weak contact between residue 1R and residue 12D sidechain
in the extended helix motif that is not observed in the helix-turn-helix
motif. Hence, the two residues may form a transient salt bridge which
stabilizes the extended helix motif, whereas on the contrary the helix-turn-helix
motif is preferred when the salt bridge dissolves. Hence, while helix
1 (residues 1–27) is stable in the crystal structure of the
full protein as a hexamer, the higher flexibility of the much smaller
segment SAA (1–27) allows this helix to break up around residues
12 and 13 into two segments, the N-terminal helix Ia (residues 1–11)
and Ib (residues 14–27).

Figure 4 Sidechain–sidechain contact map
as calculated from our ME-REMD
simulations of the SAA (1–27) fragment. The results obtained
for the case that the wild-type peptide assumes the extended helix
motif seen in the PDB structure are shown in (A). Correspondingly,
we show this map for the case of the wild-type peptide in the helix-turn-helix
configuration in (B). Note the strong signal for a salt bridge between
residues 1R and 9E sidechain and the hydrophobic contacts between
residues 3F, 21Y, and 24M are missing in the PDB structure. By design
is the salt bridge between residues 1 and 9 missing in the contact
map of the E9A mutant in the helix-turn-helix configuration, shown
in (C). Instead, we find here a signal for a salt bridge between residue
1R and 26E, and for hydrophobic interaction between residue 3F and
21Y or 24M.

In order to understand
better the appearance of the helix-hairpin
motif, we calculate the contributions of each residue to the solvent
accessible surface area (SASA) and compare the obtained values for
the different motifs. The corresponding values are shown in Figure 5. In helix-hairpin
configurations, the hydrophobic residues 3F, 21Y, and 24 are less
exposed to water than in the straight helix of the crystal structure.
Hence, we conclude that the helix hairpin is stabilized by hydrophobic
contacts involving these residues as shown in Figure 4B, that do not exist in the elongated helix
of the crystal structure (see Figure 4A).

Figure 5 SASA of each residue as measured in our ME-REMD simulations
when
the SAA (1–27) fragment is in either a helix-turn-helix configuration
(red) or in the elongated helix also seen in the PDB structure (blue).

In earlier work,10 we have studied the
segment SAA (1–13) which includes the helix Ia forming residues.
These previous results established a conformational transition between
an α-helix and a β hairpin that is associated with the
dissolving and forming of salt bridges involving residues 1R, 5S,
9E, and 12D. Specifically, by comparing the wild type with suitable
mutants we found that the salt bridge between 1R and 9E stabilizes
the helix structure, as the helix propensity for this fragment vanished
in the mutant E9A. A corresponding analysis of the contact map of
the wild-type SAA (1–27) in Figure 4B also indicates that the N-terminal helix
Ia is stabilized in the helix-turn-helix configuration by electrostatic
interactions between the charged residues 1R and 9E, which are within
0.45 nm, and therefore have a high probability to form a salt bridge.
We conjecture that the hydrophobic contacts between the helices Ia
and Ib favor a helix hairpin; however, the propensities of residues
1–11 to form helix Ia are weak, and require an alignment of
residues enforced by the salt bridge between residue 1R and 9E. Loss
of this salt bridge leads to a transition of the helix-hairpin structure
to configurations with helix Ib intact but the N-terminal residues
forming a dynamically changing disordered elongated segment (see Figure 3c) with transient
β-strands that is prone to aggregation.

In order to test
this hypothesis, we have performed additional
ME-REMD simulations of the E9A mutant, using the temperature distribution
and number of replicas as for the wild type. Acceptance rates and
tunneling times are also listed in Table 1. Comparing the mutant with the wild type,
we find indeed a lower propensity for helix formation in the first
11 residues, and an increase of turn formation to 40%, see the middle
and right panel of Figure 3.

As a consequence, we observe only two dominant clusters
for the
E9A mutant, with the frequency of the straight helix, seen in the
crystal structure too low to be observable in our simulation. If the
mutant is forced into such a configuration, it will decay. This can
be seen in Figure S4 where we show the
secondary structure frequencies measured in a molecular dynamics run
of 100 ns at 310 K, which started from the mutant in the straight
helix structure. On the other hand, the frequency of helix-hairpin
configurations decreases to 13% compared with the 33% in wild type,
and on the contrary, the content of aggregation-prone configurations
lacking helix Ia grows to 50% compared with the 25% in wild type,
see Table 2.

Hence, the replacement of a charged lysine by an alanine as residue
9, makes the N-terminal of SAA more flexible, increasing the population
of aggregation-prone configurations. However, the loss of the salt
bridge between residues 1 and 9 does not completely destabilizes helix
Ia. Instead, this helix is still weakly stabilized by a salt bridge
between the first residue 1R and residue 26E, and a larger number
of hydrophobic contacts between residue 3F and 21Y or 24M, which together
restrict fluctuations of helix hairpin configurations. These contacts
can be seen in Figure 4C, and also the SASA contributions of residues 3F, 21Y, and 24M.
Specifically, the residue 3F has in the E9A mutant about 0.3 Å2 less surface exposed to solvent than in the wild type. The
difference is with about 0.2 Å2 similar for residues
21Y and 24M.

Conclusions
In this study, we have
used a variant of the replica exchange molecular
dynamic, ME-REMD, to investigate the conformational ensemble of the
isolated N-terminal segment (1–27) of SAA. In the folded structure,
these residues form a single extended helix, but especially residues
1–11 are implicated in the amyloid formation of the overexpressed
protein. Our first result is that ME-REMD is robust and depends little
on the number of exchange attempts; that is the improved sampling
efficiency is not bought by the need to adjust an additional parameter.
The rather trivial modification of REMD leads to immediate gains of
about 20% in sampling efficiency or reduction of required computational
resources.

However a noteworthy result, our main interest is
in the dynamics
of the long helix formed by residue 1–27 in the crystal structure.
This helix is not stable in our simulations of the isolated fragment
SAA (1–27). Instead, the helix breaks up around residues 12
and 13 in a more than 50% of configurations. The resulting helix hairpin
is held together by hydrophobic contacts between helix Ia (residues
1–11) and helix Ib (residues 14–27); however, this motif
is itself not stable as helix Ia is only weakly hold together by a
salt bridge between residues 1R and 9E. Hence, in about 25% of configurations
this helix Ia dissolves and the residues 1–11 form a dynamically
changing elongated segment, with the transient β-strand content
that in a more dense environment would become the starting point for
aggregation. Mutation of residue 9 from a glutamic acid to an alanine
destroys the salt bridge, shifting the equilibrium away from the helix-hairpin
toward a motif with increased β-strand content as also seen
in our earlier simulations of the short fragment SAA (1–13).

We conjecture that a similar mechanism also applies for the full-length
protein. However here the N-terminal helix I is likely stabilized
by residues 28–76, we expect that it also exist in a dynamical
equilibrium with an unstable helix-hairpin configuration where the
first eleven residues may form transient β-strands that become
the nucleus for the aggregation observed in vivo for overexpressed
SAA. This scenario is supported by experimental observations showing
a reduction of helicity at pH = 2,18 and
an increase in fibril formation when the SAA (1–27) segment
binds with acidic lysophospholiqids instead of neutral lysophospholiqids.19 Because the wild type SAA (1–11) fragment
has an isoelectric point of 6.0, whereas that of the E9A mutant is
9.8 (as calculated by the ExPASy Server20−22), the loss of charge
at residue 9 because of the mutation E9A is similar to going in the
wild type from neutral pH to acidic conditions. Hence, the experimental
measurements are consistent with the mechanism that we have derived
from molecular dynamics studies of a wild type and mutant SAA fragment.

Materials
and Methods
The initial configuration is derived from the
corresponding fragment
(residue 1–27) of the crystal structures of full-length SAA
protein 1.1 (PDB ID: 4IP8). The mutation-type SAA (1–27) E9A was built from the wild-type
by replacing the negatively charged side chain of glutamic acid with
the hydrogen atom of the alanine side chain. The so-obtained configurations
of wild-type and mutant are together with 4700 water molecules placed
in a box with box size 5.4 nm and periodic boundary conditions, and
melted by molecular dynamics simulation at 500 K to generate random
configurations as the starting point for the molecular dynamics simulation
in this study.

These simulations are done with the GROMACS 4.5.6
software package.23 The CHARMM 27 force
field with CMAP and TIP3P
water model24,25 CHARMM TIP3P is employed in replica
exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and ME-REMD of the SSA (1–27)
fragment in the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble.23 Each replica is followed over 300 ns. For REMD,
the system contains 36 replicas, spread between 300 and 420 K, for
ME-REMD only 28 replicas are distributed over this temperature interval.
The temperatures are controlled by velocity rescaling26 and the pressure is kept at 1 bar by the isotropic Parrinello–Rahman’s
method. Constraining peptide bonds with LINCS27 allows us to integrate the equations of motions with a time step
of 2 fs. Replica exchange is attempted every 1000 steps, method is
employed to maintain a constant temperature26 and is involved to keep a constant pressure at 1 bar. Because we
use periodic boundary conditions are long-range electrostatic interactions
calculated with the Particle–Mesh–Ewald28 algorithm using a 1 nm cutoff. The same cutoff is employed
for the calculation of van der Waals interactions.

For the data
analysis, we omit the first 200 ns to allow the system
to reach equilibrium. Only the 310 replica is considered in REMD simulations.
As the ME-REMD simulations rely on a smaller number of replicas (28
instead of 36), the temperature distribution differs. We therefore
choose in ME-REMD simulations the replica with a temperature that
is closest to 310 K. This is the 308 K replica. The secondary structure
of configurations is calculated with the PROSS algorithm,29 which relies on measurements of dihedral angles
only. Configurations were the cluster with an in house tool defining
the clusters by certain geometric motifs (such as extended helices
and helix-hairpin) of the configurations. Sidechain contact maps were
derived using the gromacs tool g_mdmat which is based on the mean
distance between each residue. The SASA analysis is conducted by using
gromacs tool g_sas.
