We
have examined the π-facial stereoselectivity in the Diels–Alder
reactions of phosphole oxides computationally. The experimentally
observed syn-cycloadditions have been rationalized with the Cieplak
model and distortion–interaction model. The natural bond orbital
analysis suggests that the hyperconjugative interactions are energetically
preferred between the antiperiplanar methyl group present in the −P=O
unit and the developing incipient (−C–C−) bond
in syn-adducts in accordance with the Cieplak model. The distortion–interaction
analysis carried out for syn and anti transition states of Diels–Alder
reactions of 1-substituted phosphole 1-oxide with different dienophiles
reveals that the syn selectivity is favored by distortions and interaction
energies compared with the anti selectivity. The formation of a syn
adduct is also stabilized by the πCC–σ*PO orbital interaction, and the repulsive n−π
interaction destabilizes the anti adduct that leads to the 7.0 kcal/mol
thermodynamic preference for the former adduct. Furthermore, the distortion–interaction
model rationalizes the formation of stereospecific products in these
Diels–Alder reactions, which however is not explicable with
the much-debated Cieplak model.

Introduction
The Diels–Alder
reactions of P(IV) derivatives of phosphole
have attracted the attention of experimental and computational chemists
because such reactions form a 7-phosphanorbornene moiety that holds
unique properties of its P-center.1−5 The significance of the 7-phosphanorbornene derivatives was explained
by Quin, Mathey et al., in fragmentation-related phosphorylation reactions,6,7 complexations,8−10 and in refunctionalization11−14 including deoxygenations.15−17 Westheimer first reported the preparation of P(IV) derivatives of
phosphole, which was further explored for the synthesis of the dimers
of phosphole derivatives including oxides, sulfides, and quaternary
salts.18−20

The synthesized dimers of phosphole derivatives
including oxides,
sulfides, and quarternary salts are stereospecific, and no other products
have been reported in such studies. Keglevich et al. also reported
that the different substitutions at P(11)–O of phosphole oxides
are regio- and stereospecific though such Diels–Alder reactions
can give many isomers.21 No isomeric mixture
has been reported till date. The product from the dimerization shows
endo-fusion of the rings with bridged P=O located anti to the
newly formed double bond in the adduct and both phosphoryl oxygens
directed inward (Scheme 1). The [4 + 2] cycloaddition of phosphole
1-oxide with N-phenyl- or N-methylmaleimide
was also reported.22

Scheme 1 Cyclodimerization
of Phosphole 1-Oxide
To explain these observed results, Keserű et al.
performed
semiempirical and ab initio calculations using PM3 and HF/3-21G* methods.23 All geometries and transition states (TSs) of
1-methylphosphole 1-oxide were performed by the PM3 method, and the
preference led to the endo ring fusion from the enthalpy of activation
(ΔH#) data of all of the possible
isomers in cyclodimerization of 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide and P(11)–O
is anti to the newly formed (−C=C−) double bond
in the norbornene moiety. Furthermore, Kovács et al. have carried
out experimental as well as theoretical studies on the 7-phosphanorbornene
moiety to study the [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction and later concluded
that the formation of one of the endo isomers is energetically favored
over the other isomers based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
The DFT results corroborate the experimental and single-crystal X-ray
results. These studies primarily focused on rationalizing the formation
of exo/endo products and regioselectivity of P(IV) derivatives of
phospholes.22

In this article, we
have investigated the formation of syn and
anti isomers of P(IV) derivatives of phosphole computationally. Therefore,
this study was examined with the stable regio- and stereoisomers of
phosphole with different dienophiles (Scheme 2). The formation of syn product can be rationalized
with the hyperconjugative Cieplak model and also with the distortion–interaction
strain model.24

Scheme 2 Diels–Alder
Reactions of 1-Methylphosphole-1-oxide with Ethylene,
Its Dimer, and N-Methylmaleimide
Results and Discussion
The free
energies of activation of the transition states and adducts
were calculated using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory (Figure 1 and Table S1). A number of Diels–Alder reactions
have been studied using the B3LYP DFT functional and reported in the
literature.5,22,25 The calculated results were found to be in good agreement with the
experimental observations, and other DFT functionals such as M06-2X
also corroborated well with B3LYP results.26 We have computed the activation free energies for the syn and anti
endo isomers of Diels–Alder reactions of 1-methylphosphole
1-oxide with different dienophiles like 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide
and N-methylmaleimide, which were experimentally
examined by Kovács et al. (Scheme 2).22 Ethylene
has been chosen as a model dienophile to explore the Diels–Alder
reaction with phosphole 1-oxide.

Figure 1 Reaction profile for the syn and anti
Diels–Alder reactions
of 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide with model dienophile ethylene. The free
energies calculated using B3LYP/6-31G(d) are given in kcal/mol. Bond
lengths are reported in angstrom (Å).

Initially, we have calculated the syn and anti transition
structures
and the adduct with ethylene as the dienophile and 1-methylphosphole
1-oxide as the diene molecule. The incipient bonds formed in the syn
and anti isomers were synchronous in nature in the transition state
geometries with distances of 2.28 and 2.30 Å, respectively (Figure 1). The formation
of the syn adduct is both a kinetically and thermodynamically favored
process. The activation free energies (ΔG)
for the syn and the anti transition states (TS-1-syn, TS-1-anti) are
28.8 and 37.1 kcal/mol, respectively, at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level
of theory (Figure 1). To examine the relative preference for the formation of syn adduct
using the B3LYP functional, we have also examined this reaction with
the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level of theory. M06-2X describes the dispersion
forces better than the B3LYP functional.27 The calculated results with M06-2X corroborate the formation of
syn adduct for 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide as diene and ethylene as
dienophile (Figure S1).

There are
reports where Fallis et al. examined the syn/anti facial
selectivity of thiophene 1-oxide adducts with many dienophiles, and
the syn selectivity was attributed to the Cieplak effect.28−30 The Cieplak model was employed to rationalize many facial selectivity
reactions. The Cieplak model is based on a hypothesis, in which the
antiperiplanar donor orbital and the σ* antibonding orbital
of the incipient bonds overlap to stabilize the facial selective product
formation. Therefore, hyperconjugative stabilization energy was examined
using natural bond orbital (NBO) as implemented in Gaussian 09 (Figure 2).31−36 The better donor methyl group at the P(11)–O position of
1-methylphosphole 1-oxide is antiperiplanar to the incipient bonds
(C2–C7 and C3–C8 bonds) in the syn adduct for the Diels–Alder reaction
between 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide and ethylene. The second-order perturbation
theory calculations, E(2), suggest that the hyperconjugative
interactions are possible in the syn isomer (0.6 kcal/mol). On the
other hand, the anti endo isomer yields a lower hyperconjugation interaction
energy (0.3 kcal/mol). Therefore, it appears that the Cieplak model
might operate during the formation of syn isomer in such Diels–Alder
reactions. The effect of solvent on the syn/anti selectivity was also
examined. These Diels–Alder reactions were carried out in triethylamine
as a solvent; therefore, we have also performed single-point calculations
using triethylamine as a solvent. The calculated results with polarizable
continuum model (PCM)triethylamine-M062-X/6-31G(d) showed
lower activation barriers for the syn and anti transition states;
however, they are in good agreement with the B3LYP/6-31G(d) gas-phase
results (Table S2).

Figure 2 Hyperconjugative interaction
energies (pink) of syn endo and anti
endo isomers (Scheme 2), given in kcal/mol.

The distortion–interaction analysis was carried out
with
the syn and anti transition states of 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide and
ethylene as a dienophile. Figure 3 shows that the 5.0 kcal/mol energy preference for
the syn transition state is derived from the distortion energies of
the diene. The distortion in the dienophile for syn and anti transition
states is similar (∼0.3 kcal/mol); however, the interaction
energy favors the formation of the syn transition state by 3.4 kcal/mol.

Figure 3 B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level of theory calculated distortion–interaction
energies for the syn endo and anti endo transition structures for
the Diels–Alder reaction of 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide with
ethylene (brown, activation energy; green, distortion energy of the
dienophile; cyan, distortion energy of the diene; and red, interaction
energy; in kcal/mol).

The study extended with the dimerization of 1-methylphosphole
1-oxide
using the same level of theory. Initially, we have calculated the
hyperconjugative interaction of the 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide dimer
using NBO analysis by second-order perturbation theory, E(2), calculations, where the methyl group is present on the bridge
position P(11)–O, which is antiperiplanar to the incipient
bonds. The hyperconjugative stabilizing interaction energy for the
syn form of 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide is 0.6 kcal/mol, similar to
that obtained with dienophiles like ethylene, whereas for the anti
isomer, the hyperconjugative interaction energy is 0.3 kcal/mol between
the donor P(11)–O bond and the newly formed incipient −C–C–
bond (Figure 2).

The distortion–interaction energy was further considered
for the formation of the dimer with 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide. The
incipient bonds formed in the TS-2-syn endo and TS-2-anti endo isomers
were asynchronous in nature in the transition state geometries with
the distances of 2.05 and 2.96 Å in syn geometry and 2.12 and
3.24 Å in the anti geometry (Figure 4). Recently, Kovács et al. reported
the similar asynchronicity in the transition state geometries of 1-methylphosphole
1-oxide dimerization using the HF/3-21G level of theory.22 The activation energies using B3LYP/6-31G(d)
for the syn and anti transition states of the dimer of 1-methylphosphole
1-oxide are 7.7 and 15.7 kcal/mol, respectively. The calculated PCMtriethylamine-M06-2X/6-31G(d) level of theory showed lower
activation barriers compared with the B3LYP/6-31G(d) gas-phase results
with the preference for the formation of syn adduct (Table S2).

Figure 4 Activation energy and activation free energy of TS-2-syn
endo and
TS-2-anti endo isomers are labeled in bold and parentheses, respectively
(in kcal/mol). Bond lengths are reported in angstrom (Å).

In Figure 5, the
distortion–interaction energies calculated at the same level
of theory for the syn and anti transition states, TS-2, are given.

Figure 5 B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level of theory calculated distortion–interaction
energies for the syn endo and anti endo transition structures for
the Diels–Alder reaction of the 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide dimer
(brown, activation energy; green, distortion energy of the dienophile;
cyan, distortion energy of the diene; and red, interaction energy;
in kcal/mol).

Figure 5 shows that
2.3 kcal/mol distortion energy of the diene and dienophile prefers
the formation of the syn transition state compared with the anti transition
state geometry. The interaction energy also preferred the formation
of the syn transition state by 3.5 kcal/mol compared with the corresponding
anti transition state of the 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide dimer.37−41

The [4 + 2] cycloadditions of 1-alkyl-3-methyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-phosphole with N-methylmaleimide and N-phenylmaleimide were also reported.22 The syn cyclo-adducts were also found in each case, and
no anti products were reported. Therefore, we have examined the cycloaddition
of 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide with the dienophile N-methylmaleimide computationally. Second-order perturbation energy, E(2), calculations were performed, where the methyl group
present on P(11)–O antiperiplanar to the newly formed incipient
bond shows hyperconjugative interaction (0.5 kcal/mol) and the anti
isomers show hyperconjugative interaction (0.3 kcal/mol), where the
P(11)–O donor bond is antiperiplanar to the incipient (−C–C−)
bond (Figure 2).31−36 These results corroborate the Cieplak model for the formation of
syn adduct as observed in previous cases.

The transition state
calculations performed for 1-methylphosphole
1-oxide and N-methylmaleimide showed that the bond
formation is synchronous in nature (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Activation energy and activation free energy
of TS-3-syn endo and
TS-3-anti endo are labeled in bold and parentheses, respectively (reported
in kcal/mol). Bond lengths are reported in angstrom (Å).

The distortion–interaction
energies for the Diels–Alder
reaction between 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide and N-methylmaleimide
are shown in Figure 7. The distortion energies in the dienophile for syn and anti transition
states are similar in this case. Distortion–interaction strain
model results show that the 5.0 kcal/mol energy preference for the
syn transition state is derived from the distortion energies of the
diene, and also the interaction energy favors the formation of the
syn transition state by 3.4 kcal/mol.

Figure 7 B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory calculated
distortion–interaction
energies for the syn endo and anti endo transition structures for
the Diels–Alder reaction of 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide with N-methylmaleimide (brown, activation energy; green, distortion
energy of the dienophile; cyan, distortion energy of the diene; and
red, interaction energy; in kcal/mol).

The experimental reports on these Diels–Alder studies
showed
very clearly with different dienophiles that the exo isomers are not
formed in any of such cases. Therefore, to extend the study to examine
the complete stereospecificity, exo isomers have also been computed.
The activation free energies of syn and anti exo isomers calculated
at B3LYP/6-31G(d) show that the formation of these isomers is energetically
disfavored compared to their corresponding endo products (Table S3). The hyperconjugative interactions E(2) calculated for the syn exo isomers suggest that the
donation from the donor (−CH3) group to the newly
formed (−C–C−) bonds is larger or comparable
to that from their corresponding syn endo isomers (Table S4). Therefore, it appears that the Cieplak effect can
rationalize the formation of the syn adduct in all of the cases studied;
however, the exclusive formation of the endo isomer cannot be explained.
The distortion–interaction model performed for the exo isomers
suggests that the diene distortion energy is much higher than that
of their corresponding endo isomers and that interaction energies
also prefer the formation of later isomers (Figures S3 and S4).

The examination of the syn and the anti transition
states of 1-methylphosphole
1-oxide with ethylene, its dimer, and N-methylmaleimide
suggests that the filled, filled and filled, and unfilled orbital
interactions might occur in these cases. The NBO-calculated second-order
perturbation energy results reveal that the πCC–σ*PO interaction can contribute to stabilizing the syn isomers
and the computed values are 2.3 kcal/mol for 1-syn, 2.2 kcal/mol for
2-syn endo, and 2.2 kcal/mol for 3-syn endo adducts (Figures 8a and S5, S6). On the other hand, the anti isomer shows a repulsive
n−π interaction between the nonbonding oxygen lone pair
of the phosphorus moiety and the πC=C bond
(Figures 8b and S5, S6). It is worth mentioning here that the
interaction between the lone pair and the antibonding orbital of the
C=C bond (lp−π*C=C) can stabilize
the anti adduct; however, it would be weaker compared with the repulsive
n−π interaction (Figures 8b and S7).42 Therefore, secondary orbital interactions reveal that the
πCC–σ*PO interaction also
contributes to the formation of the syn adduct and the repulsive n−π
interaction in the anti adduct leads to the thermodynamic preference
for the syn adduct.

Figure 8 (a) Stabilizing πCC–σ*PO interaction in the syn adduct (1-syn) and (b) destabilizing
nlpoxygen–πCC repulsion in the
norbornene
unit of the 1-anti adduct.

Note that the syn isomers of these Diels–Alder adducts
can
experience attractive intramolecular C–H···π-type
interactions between the C–H proton of the P–CH3 unit and the olefinic π-unit of the norbornene ring
(Figure S8). The calculated structures
of the syn isomers of 1-syn, 2-syn endo, and 3-syn
endo reveal that the intramolecular C–H···π
distances are within the sum of the van der Waals radii (<2.9 Å).
There are reports available in the literature to support the intramolecular
C–H···π interactions in a variety of systems.43 The nuclear Overhauser enhancement effect substantiates
the intramolecular C–H···π interactions
in similar systems. However, such C–H···π
interactions would be relatively weaker compared with intermolecular
C–H···π interactions as in the latter
case the −C–H donor unit can align to achieve a better
direction for interaction with the π-system.44

Conclusions
The present study explores the Diels–Alder
reactions of
1-methylphosphole 1-oxide with dienophiles like ethylene,1-methylphosphole
1-oxide and N-methylmaleimide using the B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level of theory (Scheme 2). The calculated results suggest that the syn endo isomers are energetically
favored compared to the anti endo isomers. The Cieplak model rationalizes
the formation of the syn adduct due to the stronger hyperconjugative
interaction arising between the donor (−CH3) group
and the antiperiplanar incipient bond formed in Diels–Alder
reactions between 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide (diene) and ethylene, N-methylmaleimide, and its dimer. The Cieplak model fails
to rationalize the formation of endo/exo isomers in such Diels–Alder
reactions. The distortion–interaction model however quantitatively
explains the stereospecific product formation for the Diels–Alder
reactions of phosphole with dienophiles. The distortion–interaction
model clearly showed that the distortion energies of diene contribute
to the formation of syn products with all of the dienophiles studied
here. Furthermore, the interaction energies have also contributed
in the case of dimerization of 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide and the cycloaddition
of 1-methylphosphole 1-oxide with N-methylmaleimide.
The secondary orbital interactions in the πCC–σ*PO bond in the syn isomer also contribute to the thermodynamic
preference for the formation of this adduct. Nonetheless, the syn
isomer can also experience the attractive intramolecular C–H···π-type
interaction. The orbital analysis suggests that the repulsive nlpoxygen–πC=C interaction would
be stronger compared with the stabilizing nlpoxygen–π*C=C interaction in the anti adduct. Importantly, the
endo/exo isomers in such Diels–Alder reactions can also be
accounted for using the distortion–interaction strain model.

Computational
Methods
Full geometrical optimizations have been carried
out using Becke’s
three-parameter exchange–correlation functional of Lee, Yang,
and Parr (B3LYP) level with the 6-31G(d) basis set.45−47 Harmonic vibrational
frequency calculations were also performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level
of theory to confirm minima of optimized geometries with all positive
frequencies, and transition state structures were characterized by
one imaginary frequency. Moreover, we have performed geometry optimization
and frequency calculation using the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level of theory.
Furthermore, we have performed the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)
using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory.48 The IRC calculations reveal that the reactant and product are connected
via the transition state on the potential energy surface of the examined
Diels–Alder reaction (Figure S2).
We have further performed single-point calculations at the M06-2X/6-31G(d)
and B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory optimized geometries with the self-consistent
reaction field method using the polarizable continuum model (PCM)
solvation model in triethylamine (ε = 2.3832).49,50 Triethylamine was considered as a solvent because these Diels–Alder
reactions were carried out experimentally using this solvent.22 We have calculated activation energy (ΔE) as 1  where ΔE is the energy
difference, EA is the energy of the transition
states or products, and EB and EC are the energies of the reactants.

Free
energies are also calculated as 2  where ΔG is the difference
in free energy, Gx is the free energy
of the transition states, and Gy is the
free energy of the initial reactants.

Distortion–interaction
energy calculations have also been
performed on the same level of theory as in eq 3 3  where ΔEint is the interaction
energy, ΔE(diene)d is the distortion
energy of diene, ΔE(dienophile)d is the distortion energy of the dienophile,
and ΔEactivation is the activation
energy.

The NBO calculations have been carried out using the
B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level of theory. All of the calculations were performed using Gaussian
09 suite of the programme.51
