The sorption of water
in ionic liquids (ILs) is nearly impossible
to prevent, and its presence is known to have a significant effect
on the resulting mixtures’ bulk and interfacial properties.
The so-called “saturation” water concentrations have
been reported, but water sorption rates and mixing behaviors in ILs
are often overlooked as variables that can significantly change the
resulting mixtures’ physical properties over experimental time
frames of several minutes to hours. The purpose of this work is to
establish a range of these effects over similar time frames for two
model ILs, protic ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) and aprotic butyltrimethylammonium
bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (N1114 TFSI), as they are exposed
to controlled dry and humid environments. We report the water sorption
rates for these liquids (270 ± 30 ppm/min for EAN and 30 ±
3 ppm/min for N1114 TFSI), examine the accuracy and precision associated
with common methods for reporting water content, and discuss implications
of changing water concentrations on experimental data and results.

==== Body
Introduction
Ionic liquids (ILs)
are fluids composed entirely of ions. Unlike
molten salts, for example, NaCl which melts at 800 °C, ILs commonly
have melting temperatures below or near room temperature. This is
a direct result of pairing sterically bulky, low symmetry, organic
cations with similarly bulky organic or inorganic anions. ILs have
widespread applications in the fields of electrochemistry, lubrication,
catalysis, and as general solvents by virtue of their low vapor pressure,
high thermal and chemical stability, wide electrochemical windows,
and low flammability.1,2 ILs also offer avenues for tuning
their properties via addition or removal of key functional groups,
or by creating mixtures of varying cations and anions.3,4

As ILs enter use in new areas of chemistry, a learning curve
associated
with defining and reporting important metrics of IL cleanliness or
purity might be expected. Many experimental results are confounded
by significant variations in IL batch-to-batch purity, largely due
to current IL syntheses that occur in relatively small volumes via
varying protocols. Water is a common and important impurity in ILs,
and a few reports now exist that describe methods for removing water
from5−7 and quantifying water in8,9 IL samples. Additional
papers have reported water sorption rates and self-limiting water
concentrations for a few IL species. The effects of water are significantly
different for protic and aprotic ILs.9−12 Most protic ILs are fully miscible
with water, whereas aprotic ILs are typically more hydrophobic and
often display upper water solubility limits in the range of several
hundreds to thousands of ppm before forming separate aqueous and IL
domains.13,14 Sorption of water gives rise to varying physicochemical
properties of the IL/water mixtures, for example, smaller electrochemical
window, altered conductivity, viscosity, density, and reactivity.
These changes can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the application.
One such application is the dissolution of biomass in IL + water mixtures.
They suggest that moderate water may promote biomass dissolution by
lowering the viscosity through weakening the hydrogen bond between
the IL cation and anion.15 However, too
much water may inhibit biomass dissolution by inhibiting the interaction
of the biomass with the IL.15,16 In either case, knowledge
of the concentration of water in the IL, as well as the mixture’s
sorption properties, is vital to connect the properties of the IL
solution to the composition of the mixture. The difficulty associated
with producing truly “dry” ILs (quantitative water removal)
makes it reasonable to presume that many, if not most, experimental
researchers will be conducting experiments in ILs that contain significant
amounts of water. Hence, it is important to properly understand and
manage water’s effects to advance the utility of ILs.

Protic ILs are formed by a simple proton transfer between neat
Brønsted acids and bases where there is an acidic proton remaining
on the cation species, whereas aprotic ILs involve more complex syntheses
and do not contain a labile hydrogen.17 Although all ILs are hygroscopic, the upper limit of water sorption
and the ILs’ hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity vary over a wide
range. For example, ILs can be composed of hydrophilic, polar anions,
such as halides, nitrate, methyl sulfates, or formate, which encourage
miscibility with water. However, hydrophobic, nonpolar anions, such
as hexafluorophosphate, bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, or tris(perfluoroalkyl)trifluorophosphate,
are more resilient to sorbing adventitious water. Similarly for cations,
the addition of n-alkyl side chains can regulate
water solubility; longer, more hydrophobic alkyl chains impede water
solubility but can also significantly affect other properties such
as viscosity or conductivity. It has also been suggested that imidazolium
cations favor water sorption more than pyrrolidinium or pyridinium
ILs, based on the more hydrophilic nature of imidazolium.18 Recently introduced triphilic ILs consisting of three different nanometer-sized domains, polar,
apolar, and fluorophilic, can have important implications on analytical
separations, extraction, and catalysis.19,20 Intermolecular
structures of ILs can be affected by the presence of water thereby
affecting their performance in applications.

Two key experimental
parameters for water sorption studies for
a given IL are the relative humidity of the surrounding environment
and the flow rate of gas/vapor over or through the IL.11 However, a search of the current literature
returns only one publication that discusses water sorption into ILs
with a reported flow rate,12 and only a
small handful of papers examine water sorption with respect to relative
humidity.8−12,21,22 Using gravimetric analysis, Chiappe reports that water sorption
is first order in bulk, aprotic ILs.11 However,
using spectroscopy, Tran revealed that the anion is the key factor
in determining water sorption kinetics that are complex, may sometimes
follow first-order kinetics, but can also exhibit changes so as the
sorption proceeds to higher water concentrations.9

Because of water’s ubiquity and sometimes
deleterious effects
on IL performances, it can be argued to be one of the most important
impurities in ILs. It can be incorporated into ILs as a residue from
synthesis, as a reaction byproduct, or by sorption from the atmosphere
(e.g., via handling during experimentation). Drying ILs is usually
achieved by placing the IL under high vacuum at elevated temperatures
for several hours (e.g., 10–5 mbar at 60 °C
for 10 h).6 However, removing all water
is challenging, and the extent of residual water’s role in
the IL is largely unknown.

Given the propensity for impurities
to concentrate at interfaces,
the presence of even very low levels (<100 ppm) of water raises
serious implications for heterogeneous processes in IL solvents.23 Previous studies on the effect of water on the
interfacial structure of ILs show that water prefers to interact with
the bulk molecules in water-miscible ILs, whereas in the case of water-immiscible
ILs, water tends to solvate ions at the interface, as indicated by
the change in orientation of surface cation dipoles when exposed to
water.24,25 A recent paper by Endres et al. using in
situ atomic force microscopy and vibrational spectroscopy demonstrates
that the structure of the innermost (Stern) layer in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
trifluoromethylsulfonate + water on Au(111) depends on both the applied
potential and quantity of water.26 Their
work reveals a transition from a multilayer structure to a classical
double layer structure at −1.0 V versus Pt quasireference electrode
(QRE) upon changing the water concentration from 30 to 50 vol %.26

Water will certainly be active within
the electrochemical double
layer (EDL), affecting RED/OX processes, altering electrochemical
windows, and possibly degrading the electrode surface.27 Water sorption from the atmosphere has been
studied in aprotic imidazolium-based ILs by gravimetric analysis,11 with near-infrared (IR) spectroscopy,9 by volumetric analysis from a levitated IL droplet,21 and in tandem with electrochemistry.8,12 Bond et al. further compared protic ammonium-based and aprotic imidazolium-based
ILs and showed that the water concentration could accurately be determined
in situ using cathodic stripping voltammetry, representing a novel
approach for precise water determination in ILs (in some instances
down to 10 ppm water) with water below ∼2500 ppm.8 ILs show larger (3–7 V) operating electrochemical
windows than many aqueous (<2 V) and nonaqueous (3–4 V)
molecular solvents.28 This opens the possibility
of previously inaccessible reaction potentials, expanding the ability
to address intriguing research problems such as electrochemical reduction
of the radical O2•– anion,29 and the electrochemical separation of lanthanide
and actinide metals.30 ILs have also proven
effective as media for bioelectrochemistry31 and in studies of conducting polymers due to IL’s negligible
volatility.32 ILs are becoming popular
solvents in various fields of chemistry and materials science.33 Furthermore, it should be pointed out that any
water in the IL will certainly play an important role at heterogeneous
interfaces (e.g., electrode surfaces). In hydrophobic ILs, such as
N1114 TFSI, there is an apparent propensity of water to segregate
toward the hydrophilic metal electrode surface. This can impede observation
of electrochemical processes, change adsorption of analyte species
at the electrode surface, or alter the EDL morphology.27

Using electrochemistry, Compton demonstrated
that the IL potential
window shrinks as the amount of water increases. He assigned this
to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurring at lower overpotentials.12 Compton also showed that water can accelerate
the diffusion of ionic components compared to neutral species in ILs
and that “wet” ILs cannot be presumed to be homogeneous
solvents. Rather, ILs form nanostructures with polar and nonpolar
domains, which could contain pockets of higher or lower concentrations
of water, respectively.12 This has been
supported by other studies, which show that water molecules are present
in the cation–anion-charged polar domain where water molecules
form hydrogen bonds with anions and cations.34 Water has been shown to form clusters at water/IL ratios of 2:1,
and microphase separation and micelle formation occur at higher concentrations.35 Welton et al. studied the molecular states of
water in imidazolium-based ILs with different anions using Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and attenuated total reflection
(water concentration of 0.2–1.0 mol/L). They report that the
anions’ basicity plays a very important role in the interaction
with water molecules with more basic anions (i.e., NO3– and
CF3CO2–), showing stronger
interactions with water. The IR peak profiles for water dissolved
in ILs differs with anions but is not strongly affected by the total
concentration of water dissolved.13

The work we present here examines the water sorption in two ILs
chosen to model the protic and aprotic classes, which are ethylammonium
nitrate (EAN) and butyltrimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
(N1114 TFSI), respectively. Their structures are shown for reference
in Figure 1 along with
selected chemical properties. The protic EAN and aprotic N1114 TFSI
display significantly different hydrophilic/hydrophobic characters.
We examine their behavior when exposed to well-controlled humid environments
and report water uptake from Karl Fischer (KF), electrochemical, and
IR spectroscopy analyses. Finally, we discuss the accuracy of standard
KF measurements for water analyses and discuss the physicochemical
properties of water for effects on IL solvents in electrochemistry
and IR experiments.

Figure 1 Structures and basic physical properties of the two ILs
examined
here: protic-hydrophilic protic ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) and aprotic-hydrophobic
butyltrimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (N1114 TFSI).

Methods
Materials
IL samples
EAN (>97%) and butyltrimethylammonium
bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (N1114 TFSI, 99%) are obtained from
IoLiTec. The IL samples are dried under vacuum on a Schlenk line at
500 mTorr at 50 °C for a minimum of 48 h before use. Ferrocene
(Fc/Fc+, 99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar and used to
calibrate the potential axis by setting the E1/2 of this
reversible wave to 0.0 V. UV-grade CaF2 windows for IR
studies were purchased from Casix, U.K., and used as received.

Instrumentation
KF
Water content is determined using a Metrohm 831
KF titrator with a two-reagent diaphragm cell. The outer cell consisted
of Hydranal Coulomat AG anolyte (Fluka Analytical) or Aqualine Electrolyte
AG (Fisher Chemical) and the inner cell of Hydranal Coulomat CG catholyte
(Fluka Analytical). Hydranal Water Standard 1.0 (Fluka Analytical)
is used to calibrate the instrument after changing the KF reagents
and periodically during the course of these experiments. The sample
is stirred vigorously before every KF measurement to ensure homogeneity.
An IL sample size of 0.240 ± 0.02 g (∼200 μL) is
used for the measurements, and every measurement is replicated.

Electrochemistry
All electrochemistry experiments are
carried out at room temperature and ambient pressure using a CH Instruments
660D potentiostat. All of the electrochemical measurements carried
out here use ca. 300 μL of the sample.

IR
Thermo-Nicolet
iS50 Fourier transform spectrometer
with a liquid N2 cooled MCT-A detector is used to acquire
FTIR spectra. A 12 μL aliquot of the sample is pressed between
two CaF2 plates, and spectra are averaged over 128 scans
(2 min) at 4 cm–1 resolution. Duplicate spectra
are obtained for each sample. The CaF2 plates are cleaned
using copious acetone rinses followed by drying under dry nitrogen
stream between measurements.

Methods
The IL–water
samples are prepared by
flowing water-saturated N2 gas (Praxair, high purity 99.998%)
over quiescent IL (∼4.5 mL) in a sealed 20 mL vial. A T-type
fitting attached to the gas outlet is used to monitor the relative
humidity using a traceable hygrometer (Fisher Scientific) over the
course of the water uptake. The humidity and temperature are maintained
at 61.5 ± 0.5% and 18.9 ± 0.1 °C, respectively, with
a flow rate of 300 mL/min. After introducing water into the IL for
a stipulated period of time, aliquots of the IL are withdrawn from
the vial to perform KF, electrochemistry, and IR.

Although the
IL was not stirred during water uptake, the sample was stirred vigorously
before each KF measurement and before taking aliquots for analysis.
The upper limit for the N1114 TFSI water solubility is achieved by
placing 1 mL of IL and 1 mL of Milli-Q water in a sealed vial, which
is vigorously shaken, and then allowed to stand for >24 h at room
temperature.36 Any water not mixed with
the IL is decanted, and the IL layer was analyzed using KF.

The electrochemical cell is composed of a three-electrode arrangement
with a 2 mL total volume glass cell and a custom-sealed Teflon cap.
The entire electrochemical cell (glass cell and cap) is cleaned by
soaking in Nochromix acid, followed by soaking in 50% nitric acid
bath, and ultimately with multiple rinses in boiling ultrapure water
(Milli-Q 18.2 MΩ cm). All laboratory hardware is dried in an
oven at 120 °C before use to drive off absorbed water. The Ag
working electrode (CHI) is a 2 mm diameter polycrystalline disk, and
its effective surface area was calculated to be 0.033 cm2 from the Randles–Sevcik equation37 (eq 1), obtained from
the current response of 10 mM Ru(NH3)63+/2+ (Strem Chemicals 99%) in 0.1 M NaF (Alfa Aesar, 99.99% metals basis).

Equation 1 is the Randles–Sevcik equation used to calculate
the effective surface area (A) of the working electrode. 1  The silver working electrode is polished successively
with 1.0 and 0.3 μm MicroPolish II aluminum oxide powder (Buehler)
on microcloth PSA (Buehler) pads, sonicated in Milli-Q water for 5
min, and rinsed with ample amounts of Milli-Q water. When not in use,
the electrode is kept in Milli-Q water after polishing to preserve
the electrode surface.

The counter electrode and QRE are made
of Pt wire (Alfa Aesar,
99.997% metals basis) and cleaned by passing through a hydrogen flame
(Praxair, UHP H2 99.999%) before introduction into the
electrochemical cell.

All electrochemical measurements are carried
out on the laboratory
benchtop in a grounded Faraday cage. To maintain the integrity of
the water content, no purging of the IL or IL–water solutions
is done before electrochemical measurements because routine purging
of the solution and/or headspace with dry, inert gas has been shown
to drastically alter the concentration of water.38 Instead an airtight Teflon cap is used with tightly sealed
ports for the three electrodes.

Capacitance measurements are
done in tandem with cyclic voltammetry
measurements in the same solution. Impedance versus potential measurements
taken at a frequency of f = 10 Hz and an amplitude
of 5 mV are used to calculate the capacitance versus potential curves.
To minimize hysteresis, these data are always acquired from negative
to positive (i.e., cathodic potentials to anodic potentials). Capacitance
(C) in farads is related to impedance (Zj) in ohms via

Equation 2 is the
capacitance equation used to calculate the effective
capacitance from the measured imaginary impedance (Zj). 2  where ω = 2πf.39

Results and Discussion
Our work focuses on ILs with low concentrations of water (ca. 0.005–0.60%,
or 50–6000 ppm water), which is where a majority of experimentalists
operate. We report water uptake in these liquids from a metered, humidified
nitrogen gas flow across the headspace of an IL sample enclosed in
a scintillation vial. This provides quantifiable levels of water exposure
and for mitigation of dissolved oxygen that can hinder electrochemical
analyses. We will present and discuss data and results for EAN, followed
by N1114 TFSI.

EAN
Water sorption data for EAN can be seen in Figure 2, plotted as a function
of time. Data points represent an average of three independent trials
conducted under the same experimental conditions. A table of all independent
measurements is provided for reference in Table S1. The trace shows that the water content in the IL increases
prodigiously with time exposed to the humid atmosphere (62% RH) from
ca. 100 ppm (dry) to ca. 6000 ppm. The data also display relative
standard deviations that range from 2 to 10%, with larger differences
occurring at the lower concentrations of water in the IL. Previous
studies have examined two protic ammonium-based ILs (bis(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium
acetate and triethylammonium acetate) and found that the former reached
20 wt % water (200 000 ppm) in 250 min with a relatively linear
sorption, whereas the latter reached 20 wt % in 140 min where the
water sorption curve began to level off near the end of the experiment.8 Although both of these ILs are protic, the more
hydrophilic bis(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium acetate demonstrated a water
sorption curve that is more linear versus the slightly less hydrophilic
IL, triethylammonium acetate. Albrecht et al. studied aprotic imidazolium-based
ILs with fluoride and sulfate anions using volumetric analysis of
a levitated drop. They found that water uptake levels off at the equilibrium
concentrations in the respective IL and the mole fraction of water
after equilibrium at 61% RH was higher for ILs with sulfate anions
as compared to ILs with fluoride anions, as indicated by the shifts
in the Raman bands of the sulfate-containing ILs.21 The water uptake is also affected by the alkyl chain length
of both the cation and the anion.21

Figure 2 Average water
concentration of EAN over 20 min of exposure to a
humidified nitrogen stream. Data points are averages of at least three
trials under identical experimental conditions. Some error bars are
contained within the size of the data point.

Figure S1a and the inset demonstrate
a narrowing of the cathodic potential limit in EAN concomitant with
increasing water concentration. Oxidation of the silver electrode
in the anodic limit has an onset potential near 0 V versus Fc/Fc+. The potential window narrows by ca. 40 mV between the driest
and wettest EAN samples (120–8900 ppm). A similar effect has
been demonstrated previously on Pt electrodes in imidazolium-based
IL and is attributed to HER occurring on silver at less negative overpotentials
as the water concentration increases.36 Impedance–potential curves shown in Figure S1b demonstrate an increase in the overall capacitance of the
system as the concentration of water increases. Dry ILs are known
to have capacitance charging values on the order of 10 μF/cm2, which is significantly less than those of dilute aqueous
electrolytes and suggested to indicate a collapsed double-layer structure.6,40 The increase in capacitance values observed with increasing hydration
of the IL suggests that water may be affecting the interface by solvating
the IL, which would increasingly resemble an aqueous electrolyte interface
and increase the capacitive response. Figure 3a shows the increase in the peak cathodic
current, taken at the switching potential −1.16 V versus Fc/Fc+, as a function of increasing water concentrations. The trend
appears to level off at water concentrations of ≥3500 ppm water. This
could be indicative of water condensing at the electrode surface,
exposing the cathode to a water film as the bulk concentration exceeds
≥3500 ppm in EAN. Interestingly, water condensing on an Au
electrode has been recently reported in BMIM TFSI at bulk concentrations
as low as 700 ppm water.27,41Figure 3b plots capacitive values taken at the local
minimum (found at −0.42 V vs Fc/Fc+ see Figure S1b) for the EAN system as a function
of water concentration. The trend in capacitance values is inversely
related to the current density.

Figure 3 Plots demonstrating the
increase in current density (a) and capacitance
(b) in EAN solutions of increasing water concentration. Current data
are taken from cyclic voltammetry (50 mV/s sweep rate) at the cathodic
switching potential (−1.16 V vs Fc/Fc+). Capacitance
data are taken at −0.42 V vs Fc/Fc+.

Figure 4 shows the
IR absorption profile of EAN samples containing 120 ppm (black) and
8900 ppm (red) concentration water. These data are normalized to the
stretching vibrational band of NH3+ at 2600
cm–1 to correct for small changes in the path length
of the IR transmission cell. The two spectra overlap well except for
the −OH stretching region (ca. 3000–3700 cm–1), which contains absorption modes that are affected significantly
by changing concentrations of water.42−44 The broad feature at
3460 cm–1 is characteristic of liquid water’s
symmetric OH stretch. This feature’s peak vibrational energy
and broad envelope indicate that water domains in EAN are large enough
to form hydrogen bonding networks similar to bulk water.45 The variation in intensity in the 2900–3200
cm–1 region could be attributed to the interaction
of water molecules with the ethylammonium cation through formation
of hydrogen bonds.46 The intensity increases
with an increase in water content. At lower water concentrations (data
not shown), the energy of IR absorption and width of this peak also
indicate large water domains. No significant changes in absorption
were observed elsewhere in the mid-IR region (see Figure S4). The data in Figure 5 show a linear trend between the IR absorbance and
water concentrations as quantified by KF titration. The water peak’s
IR absorption increases with water concentration, following an expected
Beer–Lambert law relationship.

Figure 4 FTIR spectra of two EAN solutions with
varying water concentrations.
These correspond to the lowest and highest water concentrations in
a particular sorption trial. The inset highlights increased absorption
for water’s symmetric stretch at 3460 cm–1.

Figure 5 Transmission FTIR absorbance values for water
+ IL solutions are
plotted as a function of water concentration in EAN (quantified independently
by KF titration). Absorbance values are taken at the peak of the water
symmetric stretching mode at 3460 cm–1. Spectra
are normalized to the absorbance of the symmetric stretch mode of
NH3+ at 2600 cm–1 to account
for small variations in transmission cell path length.

N1114 TFSI
N1114 TFSI is aprotic
and considerably more
hydrophobic than EAN, largely due to the alkyl substituents of the
cation and perfluoromethyl terminal groups on the anion. It is not
fully miscible with water, and sorption plateaus at ca. 13 600
± 300 ppm water (∼1.4%), which defines the water solubility
upper limit. The water sorption data in Figure 6 for N1114 TFSI also show a clear increase
in the water concentration with increasing exposure to the humidified
nitrogen stream. A similar trend is reported for water sorption in
imidazolium-based ILs of varying degrees of hydrophobicity,11 which support the idea that IL hydrophobicity
is a major factor of water sorption. The water sorption data obtained
for N1114 TFSI show a roughly linear sorption behavior for the range
examined. Individual values acquired from KF titration for N1114 TFSI
water content over three independent trials are provided in Table S2 for reference.

Figure 6 Average water concentrations
of N1114 TFSI over a period of 80
min exposure to a humidified nitrogen stream. Data points are averages
of at least three trials under identical experimental conditions.
Some error bars are contained within the size of the data point.

The most prominent feature when
comparing cyclic voltammograms
in Figure S2a is an increase in the peak
current at −1.1 V versus Fc/Fc+ as a function of
increasing water concentration. This peak is assigned to the reduction
of a surface oxide on the silver working electrode. The oxide is created
at more positive potentials between −0.9 and −1.0 V
and is attributed to the formation of Ag2O on the electrode
surface. Similar oxidation and reduction features have been reported
on gold electrodes, and their intensities are a function of the IL
water content.8 The anodic potential limit
in these data decreases as the concentration of water increases. This
is due to increasing current assigned to HER.12,36 It is important to note that, although the Pt QRE has become very
commonly used in IL systems, it is subject to significant changes
in behavior with respect to water concentration. We account for this
in our work by incorporating the Fc/Fc+ redox couple, but
a clear demonstration of this effect is shown in Figure S3.47 Electrochemical capacitance
data that correspond to the cyclic voltammetry data for N1114 TFSI
are shown in Figure S2b, and the potential
axis has been corrected analogously to the cyclic voltammograms. These
demonstrate an increase in the capacitive feature at −1.1 V
versus Fc/Fc+. This is hypothesized to correlate with the
large cathodic reduction feature in the cyclic voltammograms, as the
concentration of water increases. Figure 7a plots the peak current for the oxide feature
against water concentration in the IL solution and shows that increasing
water gives rise to larger peak current densities. Similar increases
in current density have been reported for other aprotic ILs and attributed
to increased HER current.8,9Figure 7b illustrates the increase in capacitance
response, also taken at −1.1 V versus Fc/Fc+ as
the concentration of water increases. It is important to note that
the large capacitance values obtained here are conflated with significant
redox current from the Ag oxide feature at the same potential, but
an identical, increasing trend is seen for capacitance values at other
voltages within the potential window examined. The increase in capacitive
response from the silver oxide is in qualitative agreement with previous
reports for oxide formation on gold electrodes in the presence of
water.8

Figure 7 Plots demonstrating the increase in current
density (a) and capacitance
(b) in N1114 TFSI solutions of increasing water concentration. Current
data are taken from cyclic voltammetry (50 mV/s sweep rate) at −1.1
V vs Fc/Fc+. Capacitance data are taken at the same potential.

Figure 8 shows the
FTIR absorption profile of dry (80 ppm water) and wet (8900 ppm water)
N1114 TFSI. The spectra are normalized to the C–H stretching
mode at 3050 cm–1 to correct for small variations
in the FTIR transmission cell path length. The peaks in these two
spectra overlap well except in the region between 3500 and 3700 cm–1 where water peaks are observed. Two water absorption
features at 3640 and 3560 cm–1 correspond to asymmetric
and symmetric stretching modes, respectively. Their absorption energy
and relatively narrow width indicate that these water molecules are
likely isolated within the IL as monomers that are not participating
in a hydrogen bonding network. The black (lower) trace represents
the lowest concentration of water in the IL we obtained, acquired
immediately after the IL was removed from the Schlenk line vacuum.
The red (upper) trace corresponds to the highest concentration of
water absorbed by the IL after 80 min of exposure to flowing humid
nitrogen gas as described. No significant changes in absorption were
observed elsewhere in the mid-IR region (see Figure S4). A series of absorbance data for these water modes are
plotted as a function of water concentration in Figure 9. The absorbance values of both water peaks
increase linearly with the water concentration in all trials.

These correspond to the lowest and highest water concentrations in
a particular sorption trial. The inset highlights increased absorption
for water’s symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes at 3560
and 3640 cm–1, respectively.

by KF titration. The absorbance is normalized to the absorbance of
the C–H stretching mode at 3050 cm–1. These
represent individual data points acquired over three replicate trials
as shown.

Discussion
EAN
is a protic, hydrophilic IL, and a linear
fit to the water uptake data in Figure 2 yields a water sorption rate of 270 ± 30 ppm/min.
N1114 TFSI is an aprotic, hydrophobic IL that shows a lower water
sorption rate of 30 ± 3 ppm/min, based on a linear fit to data
in Figure 6. We attribute
the difference in sorption rates primarily to the significant variation
of hydrophobic character of the ILs and capability of both cation
and anion in the case of EAN to form hydrogen bonds with water. We
find here that the water uptake rate of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
TFSI (η = 54.5 cP at 25 °C) is lower (21 ± 1 ppm/min)
than that of N1114 TFSI (η = 116 cP at 25 °C), indicating
that the bulk IL viscosity is not the major factor in water sorption
for these IL mixtures. The peak profile corresponding to the C–H
stretching of the imidazolium ring varies with the anion, indicating
that anions interact with the hydrogens on the ring.48 In the presence of water, the hydrogens on the imidazolium
ring compete with water to interact with the anion. In the case of
N1114 TFSI, no such hydrogens are present to compete with water. Hence,
sorption of water is higher in N1114 TFSI. It should be noted that
the rates of water sorption are likely to change as the sorption process
continues beyond the range examined here. Indeed, some reports show
that the rate of water sorption reaches a plateau as the IL + water
solution becomes saturated with water.8,9,11,12,21,22 Changing rates of sorption suggest
that the water sorption curves similar to those shown in Figures 2 and 6 could show one or more inflection points if followed to longer
times (higher water concentrations), but it is reasonable to expect
linear sorption behaviors within the fairly narrow window of water
concentrations observed here.

At the gas–liquid interface,
an impinging gas molecule has three possible fates; it can bounce
off the surface, reside briefly at the surface before dissolving into
the IL, or reside briefly and again desorb back into the gas phase.11 The favorability of the water molecule–surface
interaction depends on many factors. These include the surface area
of the IL,49 stirring which might alter
the interfacial structure, the gas flow rate and its angle of incidence,
the presence of small impurities (including other water molecules)
within the IL which may enhance water sorption,50,51 and the chemical nature52 of the chosen
IL. In our experiments humidified nitrogen gas was introduced perpendicular
to the IL surface at a flow rate of 300 mL/min at room temperature.
Certainly, the concentration and orientation of IL cations and anions
at the gas/liquid interface would have significant impact on the initial
adsorption of water, whereas the bulk properties of the IL would more
strongly affect sorption. Baldelli has suggested that the gas–liquid
interface for ILs likely contains equal contributions from cations
and anions.53 It is also suggested that
the anion plays a key role in solubilizing water in bulk ILs.21,48,54 Water interacts with IL through
formation of hydrogen bonds with the anion where water acts as a Brønsted
acid and the anion acts as the Brønsted base. The strength of
the hydrogen bond depends on the anion basicity.21,48,54 Tailoring the IL to have a larger surface
contribution from the anion could increase the probability of an impinging
water molecule to stick to the IL surface, rather than bounce off
a neutral or positive site. The second step is diffusion of gas molecules
through the gas–liquid interfacial region, which has been reported
to be a slow process for other gas phase molecules,55 and subsequent solvation with IL ions or other water molecules.
In the absence of stirring, this will likely be driven by concentration
gradients and governed by chemical interaction forces (e.g., hydrogen
bonding and van der Waals forces) between the water and the IL. In
the ILs studied here, NO3– (pKa of HNO3 = −1.7) ion is a stronger Brønsted base than
TFSI (pKa of HTFSI = −11.9),56 which
makes its interaction with water stronger, in addition to the interaction
of the ammonium head group with water. This promotes a water solvating
effect and leads to water clusters around the anion in EAN more readily
than the weaker base TFSI ion.13 The broad
IR water peak in Figure 4 supports the possibility of water clusters, which may work to enhance
water dissolution into the IL bulk phase, increasing the overall rate
of water sorption and ultimate water miscibility.

The absolute
determination of water concentration in an IL sample
is often achieved using KF titration. However, most IL research is
done using small volumes to minimize costs, and the sample volume
lost to KF analysis is not trivial. The KF manufacturer (Metrohm)
recommends using 1.0–10.0 g of the sample (ca. ∼800–8000
μL for ILs) for water concentrations between 5000 and 10 ppm,
respectively.57 This may not be cost-effective
or even possible for some ILs, particularly those that come in limited
quantities from custom syntheses, which can be resource intensive.
For our KF measurements, we used an average sample size of 0.240 ±
0.02 g (∼200 μL).18 We find
that this relatively small amount of IL gives KF results well above
the threshold quantitation limits of the instrument. A literature
search for water quantification in ILs returned only two other results
that listed KF titration with a reported sample size (1 mL of 20%
w/w solution of the IL in diluted anhydrous methanol58 or following ASTM Standard Test Method E 1064-00 with a
sample size of 1.5 g of IL).59

Because
of the variability in sorption rates of water, several
aliquots of the IL should be analyzed by KF to accurately quantify
water concentrations (refer to Tables S1 and S2 for our compiled KF data). For example, replicate measurements on
individual trials taken from the 20 min exposure (trial 2) sample
of EAN gave water content values that range from 5707 to 5387 ppm;
a difference of 320 ppm water or roughly an uncertainty of 6%. Other
measurements of EAN taken directly from the Schlenk vacuum produce
readings of water content that range from 133 to 104 ppm. Correspondingly,
this difference represents an uncertainty of ca. 24%. Although all
KF measurements did not produce variations of this magnitude, these
deviations represent significant concern in experimental work and
must be considered. A few reports have demonstrated similar uncertainties
to those in our work here.59,60

Proper maintenance
and handling of the IL samples are also important.
Samples in this study are dried and transferred using Schlenk techniques
and stored in dry/glove boxes. In an effort to compare this careful
handing to less stringent laboratory methods, we placed ∼2
mL of N1114 TFSI in a capped 20 mL vial and kept it in a laboratory
bench drawer for the duration of these experiments (18 days). We took
an initial KF measurement and found that the IL contained ∼100
ppm water, a relatively dry sample. We withdrew periodic aliquots
for KF analysis, and after 2.5 weeks, the water content had increased
to ∼1100 ppm. The average humidity of our laboratory over this
span is 20% (dry Iowa winter), and our laboratory temperature is around
20 °C. The hygroscopic nature of even this “hydrophobic”
IL can result in an order of magnitude difference in the water content
from storage in a sealed vial. For our experimentation, the ILs are
constantly under vacuum on our Schlenk line for >2 days at 50 °C
with vigorous stirring before use. Implementing a Schlenk line and
dry/glove box is imperative to control or mitigate water sorption
in ILs.

Viscosity is an important physicochemical parameter
to understand
and it varies from IL to IL. In general, ILs are more viscous (1–3
orders of magnitude) than aqueous and nonaqueous solvents. Figure 1 lists the viscosities
of the two ILs examined in this work. N1114 TFSI has a viscosity 4×
higher than EAN. This has implications on several parameters, particularly
in tribology and electrochemistry, but we do not believe that viscosity
is a major factor in controlling the rate of water sorption in ILs,
as indicated by the data acquired on BMIM TFSI, which is discussed
above. In the presence of water, the IL–water mixture’s
viscosity is lowered from that of the neat IL.60,61 This affects mass transport processes and is a major factor in the
conductivity of the solvent.59 It is known
that IL conductivity can be increased via water addition (with a concomitant
lowering of the viscosity), but as we have seen, the presence of water
has additional implications on the electrochemical system.62

The IR absorption profiles for water in
the two reported ILs are
significantly different, but data acquired for a single IL do not
change the absorption profile shape even with significantly varying
water concentrations. Water absorbed in EAN is represented by a single
broad peak, corresponding to the symmetric stretching vibrational
mode of water, whereas the water in N1114 TFSI is represented by two
peaks, corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes.
The presence of narrow O–H bands for the asymmetric and symmetric
modes indicates the presence of water monomers that do not participate
in a water–water hydrogen bonding network.13 This is a significant difference in the IR peak profile
and is attributed to the different anions and the protic nature of
EAN. In the case of EAN, the ethyl group forms the nonpolar domain
and the charged groups form the polar domain in the bulk nanostructure.63,64 Water can form hydrogen bonds with the nitrate ion, which acts as
a Brønsted base, as well as with the ammonium head group, which
acts as a donor.46 In the presence of a
Brønsted base like [NO3]−, several
water molecules can interact with the anion through H-bonding. We
predict that this can seed water clusters and lead to coalescing and
red-shifting of OH asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands, as seen
in Figure 4. The presence
of two water peaks in the N1114 TFSI spectra is attributed to monomeric
water molecules and agrees with the results reported by Welton et
al.48

Conclusions
This
work reports water sorption rates for one hydrophilic IL and
one hydrophobic IL across a water concentration range from 50 to 6000
ppm. EAN is a protic IL that demonstrates a relatively fast water
sorption rate (270 ± 30 ppm/min) over the first 20 min of exposure
when compared to N1114 TFSI, a hydrophobic IL that sorbs water at
a slower rate (30 ± 3 ppm/min) over the first 80 min of exposure.
The interactions of water vary drastically in different ILs, as indicated
by different IR peak profiles for the OH stretches of water. In these
studies, EAN clearly shows a broad symmetric stretching peak indicative
of water clusters able to form a hydrogen bonding network, whereas
N1114 TFSI shows two well-resolved peaks corresponding to symmetric
and asymmetric modes of water monomers. The behavior of water molecules
in EAN or N1114 TFSI is not affected significantly by water concentration
over the ranges examined here. Electrochemistry results show a systematic
increase in HER currents at −1.16 V versus Fc/Fc+ for EAN solutions that contained incrementally higher concentrations
of water. This shows the expected increased current and lower overpotential
expected for HER on silver cathodes as the concentration of water
increases. Moreover, our data suggest that water may be “condensing”
on the Ag electrode surface at concentrations ≥3500 ppm water.
Furthermore, our data show the peak current due to Ag-oxide reduction
at −1.1 V versus Fc/Fc+ in N1114 TFSI correlated
with the water concentration (i.e., a higher water concentration yielded
a larger overall oxide reduction peak current). This confirms that
water levels can be probed in situ, particularly at smaller concentrations
(0.005–0.10%, or 50–1000 ppm water), where many experimentalists
operate with ILs. All of the results presented in this study bring
attention to key parameters that should be controlled to allow meaningful
comparisons of data from IL experiments across the multiple fields
in which they are now employed.
