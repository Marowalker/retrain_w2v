A novel
three dimensional electrochemical reactor with nickel foam
and carbon paper used as the anode and stainless steel mesh used as
the cathodewas studied in this research. Oxidation mercury removal
is performed in a self-made diffusion reactor. The influence of the
electrolysis voltage, pH, gas flow, and other factors on mercury removal
is discussed, as well as the mechanism of anodization mercury removal
is explored. The experimental results show that nickel foam has a
significant effect on the removal of Hg0, and 80–85%
removal can be achieved under optimal conditions. Meanwhile, nickel
foam has stable performance at high temperatures (60 °C) and
in strong alkaline electrolytes, which also play an effective role
in anodized oxidation. Although carbon paper is more stable than nickel
foam and less affected by experimental factors, it is sensitive to
reaction temperature and can only work in the neutral electrolyte
at low temperatures. In contrast, electrochemical catalytic oxidation
technology using the nickel foam is more promising for Hg0 removal.

1 Introduction
Mercury has received global
attention due to its volatility, high
toxicity, durability, easy migration, and bioaccumulation.1,2 A large number of emission inventory measurements reveal that natural,
anthropogenic, and re-emission mercury are the three major sources
of mercury emission. Coal combustion is considered as one of the main
anthropogenic atmosphere mercury emission sources. Therefore, mercury
emission control in coal-fired power plants has become a research
hotspot.

In flue gas, it is generally believed that there are
three forms
of mercury species, i.e., particulate mercury (HgP), oxidized
mercury (Hg2+ or Hg+), and gaseous elemental
mercury (Hg0),3−5 in which the main form of elemental
mercury (Hg0) during the fire enter the atmosphere with
the flue gas and cause pollution to the atmosphere, water, and soil
environment. It can also enter the body through the digestive, skin,
or respiratory tract to cause damage to the health of the organism.6

Recently, there has been a growing interest
in how to control mercury
pollution. HgP can be captured by the existing equipment
electrostatic precipitator or bag filter, and Hg2+ can
be absorbed by the wet flue gas desulfurization equipment of power
plants owing to its strong water solubility.7−10 However, Hg0 is difficult
to be captured by the existing pollutant control equipment due to
its low water solubility and strong volatility.11,12 Therefore, Hg0 emitted from coal-fired flue gas is one
of the main man-made pollution sources, and the removal technology
urgently needs to be optimized. At present, the application of adsorption
is increasing, scholars mainly focus on the study of modified adsorbents,2,13−15 such as halogen-loaded activated carbon.16−21 The adsorption technology is a mature mercury capture technology,
yet the high price of mercury adsorbent limits the application of
mercury adsorption technology. Catalysis oxidation technology has
been proven to be an effective Hg0 oxidation method that
can transfer insoluble Hg0 into soluble Hg2+, which can be subsequently removed by a wet flue gas desulfurization
process.10 The research tended to focus
on exploring the oxidation methods for Hg0. However, the
catalysis activity of catalysts is seriously suppressed by NH322−24 and SO2.12−14,25,26

The electrochemical oxidation
process mainly relies on electron
transfer without secondary pollution and can be carried out at normal
temperature and pressure without an external catalyst. It includes
two modes of oxidation: indirect oxidation of the cathode and direct
oxidation of the anode. The indirect oxidation of the cathode generates
H2O2 in situ by the two-electron process of
oxygen reduction27−29 to achieve Hg0 removal via oxidation of
contaminants. The previous research30 found
that the gas diffusion electrode (GDE)28,31 could overcome
the problem of low H2O2 yield of the traditional
cathode electrode and oxidize Hg0 to achieve the flue gas
demercuration. Direct oxidation of the anode directly oxidizes Hg0 by reaction with the electrode. To improve the efficiency
of anodization, it is necessary to choose a suitable anode material,
enhance the contact time, and increase the contact area between the
gas flow and the electrode. Studies have shown that Ni, Cu, etc. have
good reactivity,32 among which the nickel
foam is the electrode or electrode substrate commonly used due to
its three-dimensional network structure, good electrical conductivity,
high porosity, large specific surface area, and good electrode performance.
Nickel foam is often used as a catalyst carrier,33 and its special network structure can make water or gas
pass smoothly. Also, the carbon paper also has a similar porous structure.
Produced during the papermaking production, the carbon paper can fully
exert its conductive protection function and is often used as a diffusion
electrode of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell. The large electroactive
surface areas and unique porous structure of nickel foam34−36 and carbon paper37,38 are ideal for enlarging the electrochemical
active site as well as enhancing mass transfer. These two materials
enable a large amount of gas to diffuse into the electrodes’
interior and surface and communicate with the electrolyte at the same,
so the gas–liquid–solid phase is fully contacted to
achieve an effective electron transport.

In this work, nickel
foam and carbon paper were applied for Hg0 removal from
simulated flue gas at a diffusion electrochemical
reactor below 80 °C. The nickel foam and carbon paper are characterized
by cyclic voltammetry (CV), inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer
(ICP), and the mercury detector. Different addition concentrations
were used to explore the effect on the mercury oxidation efficiency
and select the optimum addition concentration. The effects of the
electrolysis voltage, pH, gas flow, and other factors on the Hg0 removal performance are investigated. The mercury electrochemical
oxidation on nickel foam mechanism was investigated via combining
the experimental data and theoretical simulation calculation. Therefore,
we choose the nickel foam electrode as the anode and the stainless
steel mesh as the cathode in the self-designed reactor to study the
electrochemical oxidation of Hg0.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Electrochemical Characterization
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) is an electrochemical analysis method
widely used to study the properties, mechanism, and kinetic parameters
of electrode processes. CV is used to test the electrochemical performance
of nickel foam electrode and carbon paper electrode. To avoid the
effect of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the scanning electrochemical
window is usually controlled below the oxygen evolution potential.
The electric double-layer capacitance is also an important factor
affecting the electrochemical surface-active area of the electrode,
whose relationship with the charging current can be expressed by eq 1(39) 1  The nickel
foam electrode (15 × 15 mm2), Pt electrode, saturated
calomel electrode, and Na2SO4 solution (0.5
M) were used as the working electrode,
auxiliary electrode, reference electrode, and electrolyte solution,
respectively. The cyclic voltammetry curve at different scan rates
(0.01–1 V/s) between −0.4 and 0.6 V is shown in Figure 1a. The CV curve of
the carbon paper electrode (40 × 40 mm2) is shown
in Figure 1c.

Figure 1 (a) CV curves
of nickel foam at different scanning speeds. (b)
Anodic peak current scan rate for nickel foam. (c) CV curves of carbon
paper at different scanning speeds. (d) Anodic peak current scan rate
for carbon paper.

As shown in Figure 1a,c, the cyclic voltammetry
curves are close to a rectangle and the
coverage area is large, indicating that the nickel foam and carbon
paper have good electrochemical activities. Meanwhile, as the scan
rate increases, the response current also increases. Due to the porous
nature of the two electrodes and the predominant diffusion control
during the reaction, the response current is proportional to the mass
transfer rate.

The current of nickel foam anode is relatively
stable between −0.1
and 0.1 V (vs RHE), so the average value of this current is selected
for the electric double-layer capacitance calculation (Figure 1b). For carbon paper anode,
the average current of 0–0.2 V (vs RHE) is selected (Figure 1d). The electric
double-layer capacitance of the carbon paper is calculated to be 4
× 10–8 F, similar to that of the titanium plate
(3.5 × 10–8 F). Also, the capacitance of nickel
foam is 2.6 × 10–6 F, which is 74.2 times that
of the titanium plate, and the electrochemical performance is improved.

2.2 Direct Oxidation of Hg0 with Different
Anodes
The reaction are carried out under following conditions
of pure air flow rate (100 mL/min), water bath temperature (50 °C),
electrolyte solution Na2SO4 (0.5 M, 80 mL),
pH (6), voltage (4 V), and reaction at room temperature (25–30
°C). After optimization, the optimal conditions should be selected
for subsequent experiments.

2.2.1 Effects of Electrolytic
Voltage on Hg0 Removal
The magnitude of voltage
affects the ability
of electron transfer and generation of strong oxidation groups, which
determines the capability of the system to remove Hg0. Figure 2a shows the effect
on Hg0 removal at 3, 4, and 5 V. In the first 10 min of
the electrolytic reaction, the removal of Hg0 increases
rapidly but becomes stable within 10–30 min at 4 and 5 V. However,
the removal efficiency fluctuates after 40 min at 3 V. It is indicated that the lower voltage, the lower
reaction rate, and the longer time are required to achieve a balance.
Meanwhile, under the three selected voltages, the anode undergoes
a water decomposition reaction to generate oxygen, which promotes
the indirect oxidation of the cathode,40,41 but it has
a little impact on the difference in the results. The final efficiencies
are 60, 72, and 72%, respectively, which show the lower effect of
voltage on the ability of nickel foam to oxidize Hg0 when
the voltage is over 4 V. The consumption increases with voltage under
the same efficiency, so 4 V is selected in subsequent experiments.

Figure 2 Effects
of various parameters on Hg0 removal of nickel
foam: (a) electrolytic voltage; (b) flue gas flow; (c) initial mercury
concentrations; (d) electrolyte concentration; (e) pH; and (f) reaction
temperature.

As shown in Figure 3a, under the condition of 3–5 V, the
removal of Hg0 can reach more than 75%, especially at 3
V (>85%). The concentration
of Hg0 is low, and the removal difference under unequal
voltages is less than 10%. Therefore, it can be considered that the
voltage has little effect on the removal with a carbon paper electrode.
According to the test result, 3 V was chosen for further studies.

paper: (a) electrolytic voltage; (b) flue gas flow; (c) initial mercury
concentrations; (d) electrolyte concentration; (e) pH; and (f) reaction
temperature.

2.2.2 Effects
of Flue Gas Flow on Hg0 Removal
The effect of
flue gas flow is manifested in two
ways: one is the influence of the residence time of mercury on the
three-phase interface and the other is the mass transfer effect. Electrolysis
is carried out for 40 min at different air flow rates (25, 50, and
100 mL/min), achieving the removal of 53, 71, and 86%, respectively
(Figure 2b). As the
gas flow rate increases, the removal of Hg0 and the reaction
rate also increase. At 100 mL/min, the efficiency stabilizes after
40 min, while the other two air flow rates were the opposite. The
result shows that the oxidation rate increases as the gas flow increases.
The possible causes are that more oxygen in the solution accumulates
with the increase of gas flow, thereby accelerating the direct oxidation
rate.42 However, the smaller the gas flow,
the longer the gas stays at
the interface and it is possible to bring out some adsorbed Hg0, not increase but decrease on Hg0 removal in the
early reaction time at 25 and 50 mL/min. In addition, the rise of
the air flow can improve the mass transfer,42 accelerating the generation of strong oxidizing groups by indirect
oxidation into the solution, which will oxidize part of Hg0 in the upper layer solution, thereby improving the removal. As a
result, a gas flow of 100 mL/min was selected for subsequent experiments.

Using carbon paper as the anode, the flue gas flow has a significant
effect on the reaction rate but limited effect on the removal of Hg0. As shown in Figure 3b, at 25 mL/min, the final equilibrium is not reached after
40 min; at 100 mL/min, equilibrium is reached in 15 min. However,
as the gas flow rate increases, the carbon papers easily caused cracks
so that the removal decreases after 25 min. The effect of flow on
carbon paper is similar to that of nickel foam, which increases the
direct oxidation rate and enhances indirect oxidation.

2.2.3 Effects of Initial Mercury Concentrations
on Hg0 Removal
In the chemical reaction, the increasing
concentration of reactants will exacerbate the intermolecular collision
and increase the reaction rate. However, in the electrochemical oxidation
system, the number of activating molecules is limited, and it is necessary
to study the effects of initial mercury concentration on the removal.

We adjusted the temperature of the water-bath to control the initial
concentration (490–1380 μg/m3). As shown in Figure 2c, mercury removal
is significantly increased from 72 to 85% as the initial concentration
of Hg0 is increased from 490 to 1000 μg/m3 but the oxidation rate all tends to become stable after 10 min of
electrolysis. The removal efficiency drops into 75% as the concentration
of Hg0 increased
to 1380 μg/m3. However, the total amount of Hg0 removed is 1030 μg/m3, higher than 1000
μg/m3. There are two reasons for the analysis. First,
the increase in the initial concentration of mercury adds the Hg0 passing through the electrode within the same time and the
same area and promotes the direct oxidation efficiency with sufficient
oxygen.15,32 Second, higher initial concentration of
mercury produces more intermediates (such as Hg+), which
compete for strong oxidizing groups,43 limiting
the system’s ability to oxidize Hg0.

For carbon
paper, as the initial concentration increases from 200
to 800 μg/m3, the removal is almost constant (Figure 3c), so it can be
considered that a good removal effect can be achieved regardless of
the initial concentration of Hg0.

2.2.4 Effects
of Electrolyte Concentration on
Hg0 Removal
In the electrochemical reaction, the
electrolyte concentration is an important factor affecting the reaction
result. The 0.05 M, 0.1 M, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 (aq.)
solutions were used as electrolytes for 40 min electrolysis, and the
results are shown in Figure 2d. The increase of Na2SO4 concentration
is beneficial to Hg0 removal, which reached 56–85%
at the end. The best removal was achieved for the 0.5 M electrolyte
but fails to equilibrate during the 40 min electrolysis. The possible
reasons to explain the phenomenon are as follows:15,44,45 (1) increase in electrolyte concentration
accelerates the electron transfer and improves the conductivity and
mass transfer of the solution, thereby improving the removal, and
(2) related studies have found that SO42– of the electrolyte can become
SO4– with active radicals. Although the
oxidation ability of ·SO4– is less
than that of active radicals, it is sufficient to oxidize Hg0. Hence, with the increase of electrolyte concentration, the concentration
of sulfate ion increases and improves the removal.

When carbon
paper is used as the anode, the removal of Hg0 rises as
the concentration of the electrolyte increases. In the three concentrations
of the experiment (0.05 M, 0.1 M, and 0.5 M), the removal is 87% under
0.5 M Na2SO4 and more than 75% under the other
two solutions. As shown in Figure 3d, the removal and reaction rate are close at different
electrolyte concentrations, and the reaction effect is relatively
stable.

2.2.5 Effects of pH on Hg0 Removal
Take 80 mL of 0.5 M Na2SO4 (aq.) as an electrolyte
and adjust the pH to 3, 6, 9, and 11 using 1 M NaOH (aq.) and 1 M
H2SO4 (aq.). After 40 min of electrolysis, although
the removal reaches 80% at pH 6 and 11 (shown in Figure 2e), the total mercury removal
at pH 11 is higher than that at pH 6 (960 and 800 μg/m3, respectively). Therefore, when the electrolyte is alkaline, the
mercury removal effect is better than that under other pH conditions.
However, the removal is only 61% at pH 3 and 67% at pH 9 (shown in Figure 2e). This phenomenon
can be explained as follows. The alkaline solution promotes the direct
oxidation reaction of the anode. In addition, the concentration of
OH– in electrolyte increases with the elevated pH,
thus the anode semireaction of water decomposition becomes more intense
and more oxygen is produced on the anode. Oxygen is further reduced
to H2O2, and active radicals at the cathode
promote the oxidation reaction.41,46,47 The H2O2 is extremely unstable to decompose
into strong oxidizing groups under alkaline conditions48 but is relatively stable under acidic conditions.30,43 It can be easily known that direct and indirect oxidations synergistically
increase the removal under alkaline conditions, while acidic conditions
limit the oxidizing ability and decrease the removal.

As shown
in Figure 3e, the removal
of Hg0 corresponding to pH of 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 are 78,
87, 87, 72, and 68%, respectively, and is best at pH 7. With the enhancement
in acidity or alkalinity of the electrolyte, the removal of Hg0 drops significantly. The reason for this phenomenon could
be that H2O2 is relatively stable under acidic
conditions and the indirect electrooxidation effect is weakened. Under
alkaline conditions, the electrolytic properties of carbon paper are
degraded and the direct electrooxidation effect is weakened.

2.2.6 Effects of Reaction Temperature on Hg0 Removal
Since the actual temperature of the coal-fired
flue gas is higher than room temperature, we study whether the temperature
has an effect on the electrochemical system. The heating belt was
wound around the reactor, and the solution was heated to 30, 45, and
60 °C by adjusting the voltage. The results are shown in Figure 2f. As the reaction
temperature increases, the Hg0 removal decreases slightly,
and the change can be almost ignored. A comparison of the total amount
of mercury removal at three temperatures, about 750–820 μg/m3, also indicates that the temperature has little effect on
the reaction system. This phenomenon is different from that described
in related literatures.43 In theory, the
solubility of O2 decreases with the increased temperature,
weakening indirect oxidation and thus reducing the removal. According
to this difference, it can be explained that this reaction is dominated
by direct oxidation.

For carbon paper, the removal of Hg0 is 87% at the temperature of 25 °C but is only 30–40%
when the temperature reaches 50–80 °C (Figure 3f). The higher the temperature,
the worse the removal effect. It can be said that carbon paper is
not suitable for use at high temperatures. To be applied to the actual
flue gas, the flue gas must be cooled first to achieve a better removal.

According to the above analysis of influence factors, the optimum
reaction conditions for Hg0 removal using nickel foam are
electrolysis voltage of 4 V, gas flow of 100 mL/min, water bath temperature
of 50 °C (initial mercury concentration of about 1000–1100
μg/m3), 80 mL of 0.5 M Na2SO4 (aq.) as an electrolyte, pH of 11, the reaction temperature of 30
°C. Under these experimental conditions, the removal of Hg0 can reach 80–85% after 40 min of electrolysis.

Unlike nickel foam, carbon paper is mainly affected by the reaction
temperature and flue gas flow, and other factors have almost negligible
effects. Carbon paper can only achieve a high removal rate under conditions
of low temperature, neutral electrolyte, and suitable flow. The practical
application of carbon paper is limited, considering the temperature
and the gas flow of the actual flue gas. Conversely, the nickel foam
can achieve 85% removal efficiency at low voltages in neutral or strong
alkaline electrolytes with high flow and has practical application
value.

2.3 Reaction Mechanism of Hg0 Oxidation
Under optimal conditions, the initial
Hg0 concentration
is 800 μg/m3 and the Hg0 concentration
at the end is 230 μg/m3. After the electrolysis is
complete, the electrolyte is taken to determine the mercury content
by ICP. The result showed that the mercury content is less than 0.05
mg/L.

Assuming that Hg0 in the solution is oxidized
to form Hg2+ or Hg22+ instead of forming an alloy with the metal,
the theoretical concentration of mercury ions is 0.03 mg/L (eq 2). The theoretical concentration
is consistent with the ICP results. It can be inferred that the assumption
is true and the reaction mechanism of anodized Hg0 can
be analyzed. Hg0 (g) diffuses to the gas–liquid–solid
three-phase interface with the carrier gas and loses electrons on
the nickel foam (anode) to form Hg2+ or Hg22+ (as shown in Figure 4). In the electrolyte,
the oxidized mercury will further to form precipitates. Meanwhile,
during the study, it is found that green flocculent precipitates exist
in the solution after the electrode has reacted many times. Also,
the precipitate is analyzed as Ni(OH)2 via dimethylglyoxime
spectrophotometric detection. It can be inferred that some of the
atoms in the nickel foam dissolved as the reaction proceeded, and
metal ions further react with OH– in the solution
to form a precipitate. The main reaction formula is as follows (eqs 3–7). 2  Anode: 3   4   5   6  Cathode: 7

3 Conclusions
The diffusion electrochemical reactor is prepared using nickel
foam as an anode and stainless steel mesh as a cathode and applied
to the removal of elemental mercury (Hg0) from simulated
flue gas. The Hg0 capture performance can be efficiently
enhanced at low temperatures. The Hg0 removal performance
of the nickel foam is better than those of the carbon paper. We investigate
the effects of voltage, gas flow, initial Hg0 concentration,
pH, and reaction temperature on Hg0 removal and determined
that the optimal conditions for the reaction were 4 V, gas flow of
100 mL/min (initial mercury concentration of about 1000–1100
μg/m3), 80 mL of 0.5 M Na2SO4 (aq.) as an electrolyte, pH of 11, and reaction temperature of 30
°C. The removal performance of Hg0 could reach 80–85%.
In addition, the reaction mechanism is also explored. Carbon paper
is also applied as an anode to the electrochemical system, but it
is found that the removal of 87% is achieved only in low-temperature
and neutral electrolytes with a certain gas flow. Compared with nickel
foam, carbon paper has more application restrictions.

4.2 Analytical Methods
The experimental
procedure30,49 (Figure 5) consists of three parts: simulated flue gas generating
device; electrochemical reaction device; and elemental mercury detection
system. The air is fully mixed with the mercury vapor, which is generated
by mercury permeation tube (QMG-6-6, Suzhou Qing’an Instrument
Co., Ltd., China) in the U-shape tube to form simulated flue gas.
Then, the simulated flue gas enters the electrochemical reaction system
through the lower part of the self-made reactor and stays at the gas–liquid–solid
three-phase interface for a period of time to be reacted by turning
on the power source. After the reaction, the gases pass through the
electrode and enter the mercury detector (SG-921, Jiangsu Jiangfen
Electroanalytical Instrument Co., Ltd., China) from the upper outlet
of the reactor to detect the concentration of Hg0 in real-time.
The experiment also set up an exhaust gas absorption bottle to treat
the remaining gas. The concentration of mercury in the solution is
monitored by ICP (inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer).

According to the principle of cold atomic absorption spectroscopy,
mercury vapor strongly absorbs the characteristic line at the wavelengths
at 253.7 nm so that the concentration of Hg0 in the gas
can be measured.

Mercury removal is calculated using eq 8, where Ct is
the outlet Hg0 at a certain time and Cinitial is the initial concentration. 8  The concentration of mercury ions in the electrolyte
after electrolysis was measured via ICP technology.

The electrochemical
performances of the electrodes were calculated
and characterized using the cyclic voltammetry curve.
