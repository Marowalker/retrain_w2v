Rapid and highly efficient degradation
of cured thermoset epoxy
resins is a major challenge to scientists. Here, degradable self-cured
hyperbranched epoxy resins (DSHE-n, n = 1, 2, and 3) were synthesized by a reaction between 3-isocyanato-4-methyl-epoxy-methylphenylcarbamate
and degradable epoxy-ended hyperbranched polyester (DEHP-n) prepared from maleicanhydride, citric acid, and epichlorohydrin.
The chemical structure of DSHE-n was characterized
by Fourier transform infrared and 1H NMR spectra. With
an increase in DSHE-n molecular weight, the adhesion
strength of self-cured DSHE-n films increases distinctly
from class 1 to 4, and their pencil hardness remains about class B–2B.
The study on the self-cured behavior and mechanism of DSHE-n shows that the carbamate group of the DSHE-n is decomposed into diamine group to react with epoxy group and form
a cross-linked structure. The self-cured DSHE-n films
were degraded completely in 2 h at 90 °C in the mixed solution
of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and N,N-dimethylformamide under atmospheric pressure
and produced the raw material citric acid, indicating good degradation
performance and recyclable property of DSHE-n.

Introduction
Epoxy-ended hyperbranched polymers (EHPs)1 as one of the important thermoset epoxy resins
(EPs) have been widely
used in coatings, adhesives,2 paintings,3 and composites4,5 due to their
excellent mechanical and thermal performances. However, the three-dimensional
cross-linked structures of thermoset epoxy resins,6−8 including EHPs
and the common diglycidyl ether bisphenol A (DGEBA), are insoluble
and infusible,9 resulting in a large amount
of cured EP wastes and great harm to the environment,11 leading to severe difficulties in degradation and recycling.10 Currently, several approaches have been used
to decompose EP castoff,12 including mechanical
recycling,13,14 pyrolysis process,15 supercritical fluid process,16,17 and biodegradation.18−20 The later three degradation methods need high temperature
and take a long time. However, ester,21 ether bond,22 disulfide bond,23,24 and triazine ring structure,25 and carbamate
or carbonate26 can promote degradation
of the cross-linked structure of cured EPs, and they can be introduced
into EP chains.27 Shirui28 synthesized a series of thermally degradable EPs carrying
secondary or tertiary ester bonds. Among of them, the initial decomposition
temperature of EPs containing tertiary ester is only 220 °C.
Furthermore, if EPs contain an acetal, ketal, or unstable disulfide
structure, it can be oxidized or reduced under the action of catalyst
or degraded under acidic or alkaline conditions.23

The cross-linking reaction of EPs needs a curing
agent. Owing to
the high reactivity of the epoxy group, both EPs and curing agents
separate in storage.29 Traditional curing
agents, such as amines, carboxylic acids, carboxylic anhydrides, and
phenols or thiols, can availably react with EPs to obtain different
performances. However, the mixtures of both EPs and these curing agents
show a short pot life, which limits their wide applications in advanced
materials. Latent hardeners, such as dicyandiamide,30 imidazole,31,32 organic acid acylhydrazine, or
ketamine, are inert to epoxy group under room temperature. Microcapsule
latent curing agent, as a new type of latent hardener, can be broken
up in the condition of heating or under pressure and release curing
agents to react with the epoxy group.33 The latent curing agents can mix with epoxy resin freely to form
a single-component epoxy resin system. The single-component self-cured
EPs not only reduce the cost of storage and packaging but also increase
the processing window. Only if the external trigger or evocating agent
is added, it can be cross-linked with epoxy resin quickly. Therefore,
single-component self-cured EPs can freely control the occurrence
of a cross-linking reaction, which have been the focus of chemical
engineers. A single-component EP containing a carbamate group can
be cured by diamine groups that are produced by the thermal initiation34,35 of the susceptibility cleavage of the functional carbamate group.
Tang36 successfully synthesized a self-cured
thermoset epoxy resin carrying an organic titanium chelate bond and
confirmed that the initial self-curing temperature was about 172 °C.

We have prepared three degradable epoxy-ended hyperbranched polyesters
(DEHP-n) by using the natural citric acid monomer.
DEHP-n could not only distinctly improve the mechanical
strength of the DGEBA but also promote the degradation ability of
the cured DGEBA.26 However, the cross-linking
reaction of DEHP-n needed additional curing agents
due to the lack of self-curing function. In this paper, three kinds
of degradable self-cured hyperbranched epoxy resins (DSHE-n) were synthesized by introducing a self-cured group (carbamate
group) in DEHP-n. The self-cured behavior of DSHE-n and the degradation mechanism of cured DSHE-n films have been discussed as well as their mechanical performance
in detail.

Results and Discussion
The Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra of DSHE-1, DSHE-2,
and DSHE-3 are shown in Figure 1a. It shows that the positions and shapes of the main absorption
peaks are almost the same due to their similar chemical structures.
The absorption peak at 3317 cm–1 belongs to the
stretching vibration of −OH. The absorption peak at 2925 cm–1 is attributed to the −CH2 group,
and the absorption peak at 1729 cm–1 belongs to
the C=O group. The stretching vibrations of C–O and
C–O–C in the ester group are confirmed by the appearance
of peaks at 1230 and 1063 cm–1. The absorption peak
at 909 cm–1 is attributable to the characteristic
absorption peak of the epoxy group. The disappearance of the absorption
peak at 2273 cm–1 substantiates that the −NCO
group has reacted with the −OH groups completely.

Figure 1 FT-IR (a) and 1H NMR (b) spectra of DSHE-1, DSHE-2,
and DSHE-3.

The 1H NMR
spectra of DSHE-1, DSHE-2, and DSHE-3 are
shown in Figure 1b.
The peak at 1.70 ppm (i) belongs to hydrogen atom chemical shift of
−CH2– attached with the benzene ring. The
peaks at 3.18 ppm (d) and 2.11–2.22 ppm (e) are attributable
to hydrogen atom chemical shift of the epoxy group. The peaks at 2.64–2.88
ppm (b) are attributable to hydrogen atom chemical shift in −CH2– attached with carbonyl. The peaks at 3.65 and 4.28
ppm (c) belong to hydrogen atom chemical shift in the −CH2– attached with the epoxy group. The peaks at 1.26
ppm (h) belong to hydrogen atom chemical shift in −CH3 attached with the carbamate. The peak at 3.94 ppm (f) is attributable
to hydrogen atom chemical shift in −CH2–
attached with the ester group. The peak at 4.52 ppm (g) belongs to
hydrogen atom chemical shift in −CH– attached with hydroxyl.
The peaks at 6.57–7.82 ppm (j, k, m) belong to hydrogen atom
chemical shift in benzene ring. The ratio of the peak area of the
hydrogen atoms of the 1H NMR spectrum is close to the ratio
of the number of hydrogen atoms in the chemical structure, indicating
that the target products have been successfully synthesized.

Table 1 shows the
properties of DSHE-1, DSHE-2, and DSHE-3. Compared to the experimental
epoxy equivalent weights of DEHP-1, DEHP-2, and DEHP-3 of about 199.8,
216.9, and 220.3 g/mol, respectively, the experimental epoxy equivalent
weights of DSHE-1, DSHE-2, and DSHE-3 are about 244.8, 251.2, and
255.4 g/mol, respectively, indicating an increase in epoxy equivalent
weight and the successful synthesis of DSHE-n.

Self-Cured
Behavior of DSHE-n
DSHE-1
was regarded as a typical example to study self-cured behavior due
to the similar chemical structure of DSHE-n.

The initial and rapid decomposition temperatures of DSHE-1 appear
at 114–252 and 252–400 °C, respectively, in Figure 2a. The weight loss
at the initial stage (114–252 °C) should be attributed
to the CO237,38 produced from the cleavage of
carbamate groups in DSHE-1, confirmed by the appearance of an exothermic
peak at 100–170 °C in the differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) curve (Figure 2b) of the DSHE-1. The initial self-cured temperature of the DSHE-1
is slightly lower than its initial decomposition temperature. The
curing heat can further promote the fracture of the carbamate group
to produce the curable diamine group because the cross-linking is
an exothermic reaction.34 The weight loss
at 252–400 °C is produced from the cleavage of chemical
chains. Figure 2c compares
the difference in absorption peaks of DSHE-1 and self-cured DSHE-1.
With the increase of curing time of DSHE-1, the content of the epoxy
groups reduces and finally disappears at about 909 cm–1, suggesting that the epoxy group has been cross-linked completely.

Figure 2 (a) Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), (b) DSC, and (c) FT-IR curves
of DSHE-1.

The pyrolysis mechanism of the
carbamate group is deduced according
to the infrared spectra in Figure 2c and shown in Scheme 1. Both carbamate groups (marked with green and blue
colors) should show a similar pyrolysis mechanism,39 but their degraded and produced alkenes contain various
chemical structures, besides the same diamine and CO2.37,3837,38 The blue carbamate group would be decomposed into
amine and allyl ether monomers, and the green carbamate group would
be degraded into 2-methyleneoxirane, amine monomers, and CO2. 2-Methyleneoxirane40 can copolymerize
with the allyl ether under high temperature to form a new epoxy group
(marked with green color) in Scheme 1. Both epoxy matrixes can be cured by the newly formed
diamine to obtain a cross-linked structure.

Scheme 1 Degradation Mechanism
of Carbamate Groups
Performance of Self-Cured DSHE-n
The
performance of self-cured DSHE-n films is shown in Table 2. With the increase
of DSHE-n molecular weight, the adhesion strength
increases distinctly from class 1 to 4, and their pencil hardness
remains about class B–2B. The adhesion strength of epoxy resins
is decided by the internal stress, polarity of functional groups,
molecular weight, and so on. During the self-curing of epoxy resin,
the fracture of the old bonds and the formation of new bonds result
in the formation of internal stress. DSHE-1 with low epoxy equivalent
weight (Table 1) should
imply rapid curing speed, resulting in internal stress and low adhesion
strength,41 compared to that of DSHE-3
with high epoxy equivalent weight. Additionally, the content of hydroxyl
groups of DSHE-n increases with an increase in their
molecular weights. The polar hydroxyl group content of DSHE-1 is also
lower than that of DSHE-3, indicating the low adhesion strength of
self-cured DSHE-1, being attributable to the fact that the hydroxyl
group has hydrogen bonds that interact with the surface of metal materials
to increase the adhesion strength.42

TGA curings
of the self-cured DSHE-n films are
shown in Figure 3. Table 3 summarizes the typical
thermal degradation temperatures for T5 (5% weight loss), T10 (10% weight loss),
and Tmax (maximum weight loss) and the
char yield under 600 °C. The data show that the self-cured DSHE-n films are stable before 230 °C, and then their three-dimensional
networks are gradually decomposed as the temperature rises. With an
increase in molecular weight of DSHE-n, the T5, T10, and Tmax of the self-cured DSHE-n films decrease, substantiated by the higher content of ester bonds43,44 and lower cross-linked density of DSHE-1 than those of DSHE-3.

Degradation
Mechanism of Self-Cured DSHE-n
DSHE-1 was
chosen as an example to investigate the degradation
properties in detail due to its similar chemical structures as DSHE-2
and DSHE-3. Figure 4a shows that the degradation degree increases gradually with an increase
in the content of catalyst H2O2 solution. When
the mass ratio of DSHE-1, N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF), and H2O2 is 1:15:15, the degradation
degree of self-cured DSHE-1 is about 99.9%. With the increase of the
mass of the H2O2 content, free radicals produced
increase, and the free radicals attack the chemical bonds of the self-cured
DSHE-1 film to decompose,45 and then the
degradation products can be dissolved completely in DMF solvent. Increasing
the degradation reaction time approves the complete degradation of
the self-cured DSHE-1 film, resulting in a high degradation degree
in Figure 4b. During
degradation, high temperature can increase the degradation rate and
then shorten the reaction time.46 Therefore,
the degradation degree of the self-cured DSHE-1 film increases from
46.4 to 99.9% apparently with the variation of reaction temperature
from 50 to 90 °C in Figure 4c at the mass ratio (1:15:15) of DSHE-1/DMF/H2O2 and degradation time of 2 h. Moreover, the degradation
degrees of both self-cured DSHE-2 and DSHE-3 films in Figure 4d are about 99.9% in the same
degradation condition as a self-cured DSHE-1 film, being attributable
to their similar chemical structure.

Figure 4 Degradation condition of self-cured DSHE-1
film: (a) ratio, (b)
time, (c) temperature, and (d) molecular weight.

The degradation solution of self-cured DSHE-1 films was extracted
by the mixed solution of EtOAc and H2O for GC-MS analysis.
In addition, the GC-MS spectrum of the resulting solution is shown
in Figure 5. Thirteen
main peaks (Figure 5) appear at the total ion chromatograph of the degraded products
of the self-cured DSHE-1 film, indicating 13 degradation components. Table 4 shows their molecular
weights of the fragments. The chemical structures and the degradation
mechanism of the self-cured DSHE-1 film can be supposed and are shown
in Scheme 2 according
to molecular weights and retention time of the degradation products.
H2O2 as an oxidant is used to decompose the
curing DSHE-1, and DMF as a solvent can dissolve the degraded products.35 The self-cured DSHE-1 is degraded by the fracture
of C–O in the ester group16,18 and the C–N
of the curing agent.26 The formation of
products (1) and (2) is attributed to the cleavage of the ester group
on the main chain of the polyester. The formation of degraded product
citric acid (2) indicates the fracture of the ester bond and the recyclable
property of DSHE-1. Degradation products (3)–(13) are formed
by the fracture of the C–N of other groups. At the same time,
the acetone group in the substituent R1 is obtained by
hydroxyl oxidation,47 and the −NO2 group in products (3), (4), and (12) is produced by amino
oxidation due to the strong oxidation of H2O2.

Conclusions
Degradable self-cured
hyperbranched epoxy resins (DSHE-n, n = 1, 2, and 3) have been synthesized
by a simple method. The self-curing mechanism of DSHE-n was analyzed by TG, DSC, and FT-IR techniques. With the increase
of DSHE-n molecular weight, the adhesion strength
of self-cured DSHE-n films increases distinctly from
class 1 to 4, and their pencil hardness remains about class B–2B.
The effects of degradation time, temperature, content of H2O2, and molecular weight of DSHE-n on
the degradation degree of their self-cured films were researched in
detail. Moreover, the self-cured DSHE-n film can
be degraded completely in only about 2 h at 90 °C and produce
citric acid, suggesting the good degradation and recyclable properties
of DSHE-n.

NaOH, Na2SO4, 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (TDI),
glycidyl, chloroform, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)
were commercially supplied by Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
All reagents were of analytical grade.

Synthesis of DSHE-n
Three kinds of
carboxyl terminated hyperbranched polyesters (DCHP-n) and degradable
epoxy-ended hyperbranched polyesters (DEHP-n) with
different molecular weights were synthesized according to the literature
(Scheme 3).26

Scheme 3 Synthetic Scheme of DSHE-n
The FT-IR of DCHP-1 (cm–1): 3473 (O–H),
1729 (C=O), 1216 (C–O–C), 1631 (C=C). 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O, ppm): 6.27 (2H, s, CH=CH),
2.69–2.93 (2H, s, CH2). The FT-IR and 1H NMR of DCHP-2 and DCHP-3 are similar to that of DCHP-1.

The
FT-IR of DEHP-1 (cm–1): 1739 (C=O),
1240, 910, 844 (epoxy group). The 1H NMR of DEHP-1 (400
MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm): 6.1 (2H, s, CH=CH),
2.79 (2H, s, CH2 attached with hydroxyl), 3.17 (H, m, CH
of epoxy group), 2.5–2.63 (2H, s, CH2 of epoxy group),
4.41 (H, m, CH), 3.81–4.21 (2H, s, CH2 attached
with the epoxy group). The FT-IR and 1H NMR of DEHP-2 and
DEHP-3 are similar to that of DEHP-1.

DSHE-n were prepared by an addition reaction between
DEHP-n and 3-isocyanato-4-methyl-epoxy-methylphenylcarbamate
(EMPC) according to Scheme 3. The synthetic method of DSHE-1 was followed. First, TDI
(1.74 g, 0.01 mol) and chloroform (20 mL) were added into a three-necked
flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. A constant pressure drop
funnel was used to slowly drop glycidyl (0.74 g, 0.01 mol) to the
flask, and the temperature was increased to 50 °C and the mixture
was stirred for 3 h. The solvent was removed to obtain EMPC. Second,
DEHP-1 (8.69 g, 0.01 mol), EMPC (9.84 g, 0.02 mol), and chloroform
were added into a three-necked round-bottomed flask, and the reaction
was warmed to 60 °C for 6 h. When the solvent was removed, a
yellow brown liquid with a yield of 92% was obtained, which proved
to be DSHE-1. DSHE-2 with a yield of 91% and DSHE-3 with a yield of
90% were synthesized by a similar method. The structure of DSHE-1
is shown in Scheme 4.

Scheme 4 Chemical Structure of DSHE-1
Preparation of the Self-Cured DSHE-n Films
DSHE-n was placed in a tin box and then warmed
at 80 °C for 4 h, 160 °C for 4 h, 180 °C for 3 h, and
200 °C for 2 h. Next, the samples were cooled gradually to room
temperature and stored for about 12 h. A similar curing condition
was used to prepare standard DSHE-n films for measuring
the pencil hardness and adhesion strength.

Degradation of the Self-Cured
DSHE-1 Film
The cured
samples (0.5 g) were cut into about 1 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm specimens
and put into a 20 mL glass tube with H2O2 and
DMF. The glass tube was heated to appropriate temperature and maintained
for appropriate hours and then cooled to room temperature. After this
process, the remaining solid was filtered and washed with water several
times and then dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 3 h.

Characterization
FT-IR studies were performed using
a Nicolet Nexus 470 FT-IR spectrometer. 1H NMR measurements
were conducted using a Bruker Avance III-400 NMR spectrometer with
tetramethylsilane as an internal standard and CDCl3 as
solvents.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using
a thermogravimetric analyzer (NETZSCH TG209) at a heating rate of
10 °C/min and a nitrogen flow of 20 mL/min performed in the temperature
range of 40–600 °C. A DSC study was carried out using
a NETZSCH DSC200F3 instrument in nitrogen atmosphere. The self-cured
behavior of DSHE-n was studied from room temperature
to 240 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C/min using a 5–10
mg sample in standard aluminum pans.

The mechanical properties
of self-cured samples were tested by
a paint film adhesion tester and a pencil hardness tester according
to GB/T 6739-2006 and GB/T 1720-92 at room temperature, respectively.

The degradation degree (Dd) of the
self-cured DSHE-n was calculated using eq 1 1  where W0 is the
mass of DSHE-n before degradation and W is the mass of solid residues after degradation. Next, 50 mL of
the degradation solution of the self-cured DSHE-n film was extracted three times by a mixed solution of 15 mL of EtOAc
and 8 mL of H2O, and then the organic phase was analyzed
by an Agilent Model 6890 gas chromatograph that was coupled with an
Agilent Model 5973 quadrupole mass spectrometer.
