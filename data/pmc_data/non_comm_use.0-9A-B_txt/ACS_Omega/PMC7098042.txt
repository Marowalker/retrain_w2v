Endophytic
fungi of medicinal plants have attracted wide attention
due to their various active biochemical substances that are similar
to those of the host plants and can be easily fermented and cultured.
As a traditional medicine and food homologous plant in Xinjiang, Brassica rapa L. has a long history of applications.
Recently, it has been shown that B. rapa L. has hypoglycemic, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant
properties. However, there are no studies on the function and diversity
of enophytic fungi of B. rapa L. Four
endophytic fungus (pr6, pr7, pr8, and pr10) strains were isolated
from B. rapa L. in our laboratory.
The metabolic extracts from pr10 have significant effects in terms
of antitumor activity. In this study, in terms of types and contents,
compared with those of the other three endophytic fungi, the dominant
metabolites of pr10 were determined by comparative metabolomics analysis.
The results of metabolomics analysis indicated that the metabolites
of pr10 are rich in amino acids and sugar derivatives such as trehalose,
whose ability to inhibit the A549 cell line has been proved. This
study provides a theoretical basis for the development and utilization
of B. rapa L. and its endophytic fungi
to form antitumor agents.

==== Body
1 Introduction
As an important part of
biological resources and biodiversity in
nature, endophytic fungi include bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, and
algae; are ubiquitous in plants; and spend their whole life or a period
of life cycle in host plant tissues, which could not cause disease
symptoms in the host plant tissues.1,2 Owing to the
further study of the diversity and active metabolites of the endophytic
fungi,3−5 these have attracted global attention. The results
showed that endophytic fungi have rich biodiversity and can positively
regulate the growth and development of the host plants.6 In addition, endophytic fungi have important
biological functions such as promoting the growth of the host plants
and the defense ability against biotic and abiotic stresses.1,7 Gond et al. extracted 18 kinds of endophytic fungi from the leaves
of Nyctanthes arbortristsi, a famous
medicinal plant in India, and 10 kinds from the stems. They conducted
mycelium inhibition tests on eight pathogenic bacteria and eight pathogenic
fungi, respectively, and found that the inhibition effect on bacteria
was up to 75% and on pathogenic fungi was up to 56.25%.1

Importantly, endophytic fungi can produce
the same or similar physiologically
active biochemical substances, which have insecticidal, antimicrobial,
antitumor, immunosuppression, antioxidant, and other biological activities.8,9 Interestingly, different from the artificial chemical synthesis,
such endophytic fungi can synthesize a variety of secondary metabolites
and are easy to be fermented and cultured.7 Many studies have proved that endophytic fungi and their specific
metabolites could enhance the defense response to both the abiotic
and biotic stresses and effectively decrease the survival rate of
tumor cells.10−12 Strobel et al. isolated an endophytic fungus from
the stem of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f.,
which can produce a new cyclopeptide antibiotic with similar chemical
properties to those of echinomycin. This cyclopeptide compound can
inhibit human pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans and Trichoderma and can be used in the treatment
of fungal nail and skin diseases.11

As a traditional medicine and food homology plant, Brassica rapa L. has a long history of consumption
and is favored by Xinjiang Uygur and other ethnic minorities. It has
been reported that B. rapa L. contains
a large amount of flavonoids, sugars and glycosides, alkaloids, volatile
oils, amino acids, and other biochemical components that are beneficial
for human beings.13−16 It has nonnegligible and significant value in inhibiting the mycelium
growth of bacteria and fungi. Also, with diverse endogenous metabolites
and endophytic fungi, such plants could enhance the immunity of human
beings in various ways.17−19 However, there are no research
studies on the study of B. rapa L.
enophytic fungi, especially on its unique metabolite fingerprint.

In this study, we isolated and identified the endophytic fungi
from B. rapa L. and determined their
antibacterial and antitumor activities with their crude metabolic
extracts. Ultimately, the strain pr10, whose metabolic extracts have
effective antitumor properties, was isolated from four endophytic
fungi. For the endophytic fungus with good antitumor effect in B. rapa L., comparative metabolomics was performed
here to draw a metabolism map of pr10 to elucidate the antitumor mechanism,
demonstrating a unique fingerprint of active metabolites synthesized
by pr10 and B. rapa L. This study provides
a theoretical basis for the development and utilization of B. rapa L. in forming antitumor drugs and the rational
utilization of endophytic fungi.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Isolation of Endophytic Fungi and Preparation
of Crude Extract
The normal and nondamaged B. rapa L. was rinsed with tap water and 70% ethanol
for 30 s, sterile water 3 times, sodium hypochlorite solution (2.5%
effective Cl–) for 3 min, and sterile water 4 times
and dried under sterile conditions. Samples (5 g) were fully ground
in a mortar containing a small amount of sterilized calcium carbonate
and quartz sand mortar. Moreover, the ground samples were diluted
10 and 100 times with sterile water. The diluent was smeared on the
Petri dishes containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) and cultured at
28 °C, away from light. The tip part of the newly formed mycelium
was transferred to the new PDA medium, then purified, and cultured
5–7 times until the pure strain was obtained.

Genomic
DNA was extracted from the strains, according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was
amplified using primers ITS1F and ITF4. The sequences were compared
with those available in GenBank via BLAST. Phylogenetic analysis was
conducted using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA5.

The endophytic
strain was inoculated into the Erlenmeyer flask
containing potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium and fermented at 28
°C for 15 days. Then, the culture medium was extracted by organic
solvents ethyl acetate (EtAc) 3 times. After that, all extracts were
evaporated in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure.

2.2 Antitumor Activity Assay Determination (CCK8)
Human
alveolar adenocarcinoma cells (A549) in the logarithmic growth
phase with good growth state were taken, the cell density was adjusted
to 5 × 104 mL–1 by Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), and the cell suspension of
100 microcells per well was added into a 96-well plate. At the same
time, the PBS blank group and normal cell control group were set for
overnight culture at 37 °C (100 microcells were added into the
holes around cell holes). Cells were treated respectively according
to different groups and cell treatment settings. The extract (200
μg/mL), which is diluted by the medium, was added to the cells
in the treatment group, PBS in the blank group, and no addition in
the control group. Each group was cultured for 48 h in an incubator
with 5% CO2 and 37 °C. CCK8 (10 μL) was added
to each well and cultured at 37 °C for 4 h. The absorbance OD450 was determined by a microplate reader.

2.3 Sample Preparation and Extraction for Metabolomics
Analysis
The four endophytic fungi were expanded on PDA and
cultured in PDB. Each fungus was fermented for 15 days at 180 rpm
and 28 °C, and each fungus has six replicates. Mycelia and cell
structure were broken by an ultrasonic instrument, then the organic
products were extracted by ethyl acetate with an equal proportion
3 times, the organic products were rotation-dried at 45 °C, and
the coarse metabolites of fungi were obtained by vacuum-drying in
an oven. All of the samples were prepared for metabolomics analysis.

2.4 Gas Chromatography–Time-of-Flight Mass
Spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) Analysis
GC-TOF-MS analysis was
performed using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph coupled with a time-of-flight
mass spectrometer. The system utilized a DB-5MS capillary column.
An aliquot (1 μL) of the sample was injected in splitless mode.
Helium was used as the carrier gas, the front inlet purge flow was
3 mL min–1, and the gas flow rate through the column
was 1 mL min–1. The initial temperature was kept
at 50 °C for 1 min, then increased to 310 °C at a rate of
10 °C min–1, and then kept for 8 min at 310
°C. The injection, transfer line, and ion source temperatures
were 280, 280, and 250 °C, respectively. The energy was −70
eV in electron impact mode. The mass spectrometry data were acquired
in full-scan mode with the m/z range
of 50–500 at a rate of 12.5 spectra/s after a solvent delay
of 6.33 min.

2.5 Raw Data Preprocessing
The original
data included eight quality control (QC) samples and 24 experimental
samples; ultimately, 296 peaks were extracted from the raw data profile.
To better analyze the data, a series of preparations and arrangements
were performed based on the original data. The noise was removed by
filtering individual peaks. Also, deviation values were filtered based
on the interquartile range and individual peaks were further filtered.
Only the peak area data with a null value not more than 50% in a single
group or a hollow value not more than 50% in all groups were retained.
The missing value recoding in the original data was simulated by 1/2
of the minimum value. Moreover, the data were further normalized by
an internal standard (IS). Finally, 275 peaks were preserved after
preprocessing and all peaks in this study were searched and identified
in the local database by its MS/MS information.

2.6 Statistical Analysis
Metabolites
have been used for hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), principle
component analysis (PCA), and partial least squares-discriminant analysis
(OPLS-DA) by R (www.r-project.org/) to study metabolite cultivar-specific accumulation, according to
the normalized peak area of metabolites.20 The main analytical parameters of P-value and fold
change were 0.05 and 2.0, respectively.

To further determine
the biological significance associated with antitumor activity, we
used the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database to
link differential metabolites to metabolic pathways in pr10 compared
with other three endophytic fungi (pr6, pr7, and pr8). Enrichment P-values were computed from a hypergeometric distribution.
A P-value of <0.05 was selected to reduce the
false discovery rate.

3 Results
3.1 Antitumor
Activity of Endophytic Fungal Metabolites
Totally, four endophytic
fungi were isolated and used to determine
its antitumor activity. Antitumor activity of ethyl acetate extract
of fungi (pr10, pr6, pr7, and pr8) against human alveolar adenocarcinoma
cell line A549 was determined by CCK8 assays. The result shows that
the 200 μg/mL concentration extract produce more than 50% reduction in viability of A549 cells
and its inhibition on other cell lines is also better than those of
pr6, pr7, and pr8 (Table 1). However, pr6, pr7, and pr8 did not show significant inhibition
of A549 cells and other cell lines. The phylogenesis suggests that
pr10 is a member of Alternaria. It has the closest genetic relationship
with Alternaria brassicae. The mycelium
morphology also indicated that the hypha of pr10 has the characteristics
of Alternaria such that the hyphae are septate and
brown conidiophores are solitary or clustered (Figure 1).

To investigate
the factor that causes the effective antitumor activity
of pr10 that is different with other three endophytic fungi, six biological
replicates of each endophytic fungus were harvested for metabolomics
analysis. For this experiment, metabolites of such four endophytic
fungi cultured for 15 days were extracted. Principle component analysis
(Figure 2A) was used
to evaluate the biological variability among all samples and the metabolic
differences among such four endophytic fungi. The result of PCA analysis
indicated that four distinct regions with different colors were clustered,
especially in sample pr10 that formed a red oval demonstrating that
there is a significant metabolic difference between fungus pr10 and
other three endophytic fungi. In addition, to verify the difference
and variability of the overall metabolic profile, hierarchical clustering
was performed for further analysis (Figure 2B). The hierarchical clustering showed that
four clades were clustered and each clade is made up of a specific
fungus with its six replicates. Interestingly, the replicates of pr10
formed a separate clade, demonstrating that there is a significant
metabolic difference between pr10 and other three endophytic fungi.
Therefore, with the antineoplastic activity of pr10, it could be concluded
that the metabolic profile of pr10 has a potential antitumor effect.

(Hotelling’s T-squared ellipse). (B) Hierarchical clustering

profile of pr10.

3.2 Discovery
of Candidate Metabolites from All
Metabolomics Profiles
Based on the most effective antitumor
activity of pr10 compared with those of other three endophytic fungi,
the identified metabolites that matched the conditions (log 2
fold changed ≥ 2; FDR ≤ 0.05, and VIP > 1.0) were
defined
as candidate metabolites (Figure 3A–C). The volcano plot was used to excavate
the candidate metabolites in each pairwise comparison group (D15-pr10
vs pr6, D15-pr10 vs pr7, and D15-pr10 vs pr8). Compared with the metabolic
profile of pr6, 31 metabolites could match the condition and be identified
as candidate metabolites that have potential antitumor activity. Among
such 31 metabolites, 5 metabolites were unknown and 26 metabolites
were identified against a local database with its MS/MS fragment information
(Figure 3A). After
comparing pr7, 47 metabolites were increased in pr10 with various
levels and 8 out of all identified metabolites were unknown. Finally,
compared with pr8, 46 metabolites were in a dominant position and
9 out of all different metabolites were unknown.

Figure 3 Excavating of candidate
metabolites in each pairwise comparison.
(A–C) Volcano plot showed the metabolites match the condition
(log 2 fold changed ≥ 2, FDR ≤ 0.05, and VIP
> 1.0) in each pairwise comparison and dug out the candidate metabolites
with various increased and decreased levels. Each point in the volcano
diagram represents a metabolite, and the horizontal coordinate represents
the multiple changes of the group of substances compared (log 2
fold change), and the vertical coordinate represents the P-value of Student’s t-test (−log10P-value). The red plot and blue plot represent
the significantly increased and decreased metabolites, respectively.
The metabolites labeled by the gray plot are not significant in a
pairwise comparison. Moreover, the scatter size represents the VIP
value of the OPLS-DA model; the larger the scatter point, the larger
the VIP value. (a, c, e) OPLS-DA analysis of each pairwise comparison
(D15-pr10 vs pr6, D15-pr10 vs pr7, and D15-pr10 vs pr8). As can be
seen from the OPLS-DA score plot, the differences between each pairwise
comparison group of samples are very significant and all samples are
within 95% confidence intervals (Hotelling’s T-squared ellipse).
(b, d, f) Permutation test of the OPLS-DA model for each pairwise
comparison group. The vertical coordinate represents the value of
R2Y or Q, and the green dot shows the value of R2Y obtained by the
substitution test. The blue square shows the value of Q obtained by the substitution test, and the two dotted lines represent
the regression lines of R2Y and Q, respectively.

To clearly analyze the interference degree of the antitumor effect
of pr10, the OPLS model was utilized. The OPLS score plot (Figure 3a,c,e) at each point
indicated a sample, and each clustering represented a corresponding
metabolic pattern in six different groups. Obvious separation of all
pairwise comparison groups (D15-pr10 vs pr6, D15-pr10 vs pr7, and
D15-pr10 vs pr8) was observed, and the R2Y values of the permutation
test of the OPLS-DA model for each pairwise comparison group were
0.75 (D15-pr10 vs pr6), 0.87 (D15-pr10 vs pr7), and 0.86 (D15-pr10
vs pr8) (P ≤ 0.05). The original model R2Y
is very close to 1, indicating that the established model conforms
to the real situation of sample data. The original model Q value is very close to 1, indicating that if new samples are added
to the model, approximate distribution will be obtained. In general,
the original model can well explain the differences between the two groups of samples. The Q values of the random model of the permutation test are
all smaller than the Q values of the original model.
The regression line indicated that the Q values of
the random model of permutation test are all smaller than the Q values of the original model. Moreover, in the random
model, the gradually decreased Q value associated
with the increase in the proportion of Y variable,
indicating that the original model is robust and does not over fit.
In addition, all these results of OPLS-DA analysis indicated high
model reliability and significant difference in each pairwise comparison.

3.3 Macromaps of the Relative Content of Candidate
Metabolites in Each Pairwise Comparison Group
To dig out
the metabolites that caused the differences among these four endophytic
fungi and identify unique and valuable compounds of fungus pr10, hierarchical
clustering analysis was further performed based on the relative content
of the metabolites in each pairwise comparisons. Also, the heatmaps
indicated that all of the samples could be clustered together based
on the significantly increased and decreased metabolites in each pairwise
comparison (Figure 4A–C). Moreover, the increased metabolites are less than the
decreased metabolites in D15-pr10 vs pr6. However, the increased metabolites
are significantly more than the decreased metabolites in D15-pr10
vs pr7. In addition, all of the metabolites display a stable character
in each replicate of each endophytic fungi, demonstrating that it
is meaningful to find some components having potential antitumor activities
in the specific endophytic fungus pr10. All of the increased metabolites
in pairwise comparison were isolated to perform further function analysis
by pathway enrichment analysis.

group. In the figure, the horizontal coordinate represents different
experimental groups (each column represent one replicate of metabolic
profile of each endophytic fungus), the vertical coordinate represents
different metabolites of this group, and the color blocks at different
positions represent relative expressions of metabolites at corresponding
positions. (A) D15-pr10 vs pr6, (B) D15-pr10 vs pr7, and (C) D15-pr10
vs pr8.

3.4 Pathway
Enrichment Analysis of the Candidate
Metabolites in Three Pairwise Comparison Groups
To further
analyze the function of the candidate metabolites, and the significantly
affected pathway that produces such key metabolites, pathway enrichment
analysis was performed against the KEGG database. The enrichment results
of the candidate metabolites from D15-pr10 vs pr6 indicated that amino
acid metabolism is the main differential metabolic pathway, such as
valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; valine, leucine, and
isoleucine degradation; and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; in addition,
pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis and β-alanine metabolism are
also significantly enhanced (Figure 5). For D15-pr10 vs pr7, the amino acid metabolism is
still the most significantly different metabolism, such as valine,
leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis and valine, leucine, and isoleucine
degradation (Figure 6). Interestingly, the same as the results above, for the candidate
metabolites from D15-pr10 vs pr8, the enrichment results indicated
that amino acid metabolism is also the main significant metabolic
pathway, such as arginine and proline metabolism; lysine biosynthesis;
and valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, which is higher
in pr10 than that in other three endophytic fungi. β-Alanine
metabolism is higher in the pr10 than in the other three endophytic
fungi (Figure 7). Such
phenomenon indicated that the high-level expression of amino acid
metabolism may lead the antitumor activity of pr10, which is more
effective than other three endophytic fungi.

pr8. Pathway analysis of the metabolites filtered in D15-pr10 vs pr8
by the conditions (log 2 fold change ≥ 1.0, P < 0.05, and VIP > 1.0).

Besides this, the results of pathway enrichment analysis indicated
that different levels of glucose metabolism were displayed in these
three pairwise comparison groups, for example, pentose phosphate pathway,
fructose and mannose metabolism, glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, and
starch and sucrose metabolism. It has been reported that glycometabolism
plays an important role in the antitumor activity and has potential
antitumor activity.21 Other metabolites
such as biochemical components produced by the biosynthesis of antibiotics
(Table 2), which was
enriched in all of these three pairwise comparisons and could function
in defense response against biological stress, also have potential
antitumor activities with their microorganism inhibiting property.

Table 2 Significance Level of Key Metabolic
Pathways Filtered by the Venn Diagram in the D15-pr6 vs pr10 Group
Compared with those in the other three endophytic
fungi pr6, pr7,
and pr8, there are 13 metabolic pathways that were significantly different
and highly expressed in pr10 (Figure 8 and Tables 3–5). All
13 metabolic pathways were variously enriched in these three pairwise
comparison groups; for D15-pr10 vs pr6, only two pathways were significantly
enriched (e.g., valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis and β-alanine
metabolism) and it had been reported that valine and leucine play
an important role in a new antitumor drug that could improve the antitumor
efficiency (Table 3). For group pr10 vs pr7, four biosynthesis pathways were significantly
enriched (P < 0.05) (e.g., glycine, serine, and
threonine metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis;
β-alanine metabolism; and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis) (Table 4). Finally, in the
pr8 vs pr10 group, except the metabolic pathways mentioned above,
there were some other metabolic pathways such as the pentose phosphate
pathway and lysine degradation pathway (Table 5). Among all 13 pathways, the metabolites
synthesized in starch and sucrose metabolism were most likely to have
antitumor activity such as trehalose.22

in such three groups.

3.5 Excavation of the Most Important and Specific
Metabolites of pr10
All of the increased metabolites in pairwise
comparative groups were classified in the upset plot (Figure 9) to excavate the specific
metabolites that are higher in pr10 than in other endophytic fungi.
The count of the metabolites with such a property is 20, and in pr10,
all such 20 metabolites are higher than their contents in the other
three endophytic fungi. Moreover, there are various amounts of the
metabolites involved in the intersection, which are shown in Figure 10. All such 20 metabolites
and their properties (VIP and P-value) are shown
in Table 5, demonstrating
a significant difference in each pairwise comparison. However, among
all 20 metabolites, 9 components were still not identified with a
detailed MS/MS information, which need further identification and
determination of their antitumor activities.

increased metabolites of pr10. The
upset diagram analysis show 20 metabolites, which were represented
by red circles and recognized as indispensable components, that were
increased in these three pairwise comparison groups (D15-pr6 vs pr10,
D15-pr7 vs pr10, and D15-pr8 vs pr10). The black bars display the
number of metabolites involved in each intersection.

pairwise comparison group. The heatmap displays the relative content
of the indispensable metabolites in each pairwise comparative group.
In the figure, the horizontal coordinate represents different pairwise
comparative groups (D15-pr10 vs pr6, D15-pr10 vs pr7, and D15-pr10
vs pr8), the vertical coordinate displays the relative content of
each component of all 20 indispensable metabolites, and colors represent
the relative contents (log 2 fold change) of metabolites at
their corresponding positions.

Except for these 20 metabolites, there are other three metabolites
that could function in the antitumor process such as trehalose, d-arabitol, and phenylalanine (Figure 11). For trehalose, the results indicated
that, compared with that of pr7, the content of trehalose increased
by 2.67-fold in pr10, demonstrating that pr10 could synthesize more
trehalose in vivo (Figure 11B). It has been reported that trehalose and its derivates
could perform various functions in the antitumor process.23 For other metabolites, d-arabitol could
effectively influence the proliferation of tumor cells and angiogenesis
during tumor growth24 and the content of
such valuable metabolites is 30.65-fold more than its content in pr6.
Many studies have reported that phenylalanine and its derivates could
suppress the growth and survival rate of tumor cells in different
ways.25 However, the content of phenylalanine
is about 230 000-fold in pr10 more than that in the other three
endophytic fungi. Moreover, all three metabolites have potential antitumor
activities, contributing the antitumor activity of pr10 on A549 cell
lines. Further analysis of the relative content of such 20 metabolites
suggests that these metabolites could form three clades in the hierarchical
clustering analysis. Also, in the upper cluster, four metabolites
are identified (e.g., valine, phosphate, tagatose 1, and threonine
1). The contents of all of the metabolites in this cluster display a lower-level increase from about
2.2- to 200-fold than their contents in the other three endophytic
fungi (Figure 10).
In the bottom cluster, all of the metabolites were identified by MS/MS
and such six metabolites (lysine, cellobiose, tyrosine, gentiobiose,
tartaric acid, and phenylalanine) exhibit a relatively higher increase
(about 8.0- to 220-fold increase) (Figure 10). Moreover, it has been proved that phenylalanine
and its derivates have potential antitumor activity.25 In the middle cluster, only one compound, pantothenic acid,
was identified (Figure 10). In pr10, the content of pantothenic acid is about 33 000-fold
than its content in the other three endophytic fungi. In addition
to this, the other six significantly increased metabolites were not
identified (P < 0.05).

candidate metabolites in each endophytic fungi.
Boxplot analysis displays the relative content of these three candidate
metabolites, demonstrating a significant difference among these four
endophytic fungi, and pr10 has a higher level of these three metabolites.

4 Discussion
In the
interaction process of the endophytic fungi and host plants,
the host plants provide nutrition and shelter to the endophytic fungi
and, in return, endophytic fungi could synthesize many effective and
active biochemical components that could enhance the resistance against
various biotic and abiotic stresses in the host plants.1 Although this has gained extensive attention
all over the world, this is still in the initial stage of research
in terms of the diversity and function of endophytic fungi, and such
research studies could be a new addition to the available diversity
of fungi.26 There is no research on the
function and diversity of endophytic fungi of B. rapa L., a widely used plant with potential medicinal properties. It
has been reported that B. rapa L. has
abundant biochemical components such as flavonoids, phenolic acid,
amino acids, carbohydrates, and vitamins; all of these metabolites
could enhance the antioxidant ability and resistance of human beings
in various aspects such as antitumor, immune regulation, biotic stress,
and abiotic stress.17,18,27 In consideration of these, conducting research on the diversity
and biological function of endophytic fungi of B. rapa L. is highly deserved.

In this study, four endophytic fungi
were isolated from B. rapa L. and further
purified in vitro. It has
been reported that endophytic fungus extracts from the medicinal plant
Umea could effectively inhibit multidrug-resistant bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and found
that 60% of the crude extracts had antibacterial effects on these
bacteria (Manila). In addition, Refaei et al. isolated eight strains
of endophytic fungi from Dahua, among which three strains of crude
extracts from fermentation broth had antibacterial effects on C. albicans.(5) To reveal
its function and application value, its ability to mycelium inhibition
in vitro was tested based on its crude extracts. The result indicated
that the crude extracts could not effectively inhibit the growth of
pathogenic bacteria (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, C. albicans, P. aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis). In addition to the antibacterial
ability of endophytic fungi, it has been reported that they have antitumor
functions because of their uniquely synthesized metabolites.28 We further tested the antitumor ability of endophytic
fungi with their crude extracts; the results indicated that among
all of these four endophytic fungi the crude extracts of pr10 could
effectively inhibit tumor cells by 54%; however, other three crude
metabolites from pr6, pr7, and pr8 did not display significant antitumor
effect. For the results of antitumor effect, it is likely due to the
use of metabolized crude extract from pr10, including D-Arabito, Trehalose,
and Phenylalanine. With effective antitumor metabolites, we performed
a comparative metabolomics analysis to study the different metabolites
among these four endophytic fungi from species to contents, especially
the metabolites from pr10.

For the metabolites in all endophytic
fungi, there are 296 metabolites
being acquired; and among all such acquired metabolites, 117 metabolites
were identified by their MS/MS fragments. The results indicated that
these four endophytic fungi are rich in amino acids and sugars, which
are beneficial for the health of human beings. Also, in this study,
by comparative metabolomics analysis, we found that the metabolic
profile of pr10 is greatly different than those of other endophytic
fungi (Figure 4), which
is also demonstrated by the OPLS-DA analysis (Figure 4). This phenomenon showed that in the metabolite
levels from the content to the diversity of metabolites, pr10 displays
a more specific property than other endophytic fungi. Compared with
those in pr6, contents of 31 metabolites are higher in pr10, such
as d-arabitol that has been researched to found that it possesses
antitumor activity by decreasing the survival rate of tumor cells.24 For pr7 vs pr10, in total, 47 metabolites were
identified and filtered by their contents and found that these were
synthesized by pr10 in a higher level (Figures 9 and 4). Also, there
is an attractive metabolite, trehalose, and it has been reported that
brartemicin, a derivate of trehalose, has a good ability to inhibit
the invasion of 26-L5 cells in colon cancer.23 The advantage is that trehalose could inhibit A549 tumor cells.29 In addition, the abundance of trehalose in pr10
explains the effective antitumor activity of pr10 on A549. Anything
else, there are other 20 metabolites that were specifically synthesized
at a high level in pr10. Among all of these 20 metabolites, except
unknown compounds, carbohydrate compounds and amino acids and their
derivates are the main compounds. Also, it has been reported that
amino acids such as phenylalanine and its derivates, for example, l-phenylalanine dipeptide derivatives, are effective in treating
cancer and have a preferable inhibitory effect on prostate cancer
cell line PC3 and K562 cells in vitro.25 Carbohydrates and their derivates such as fucose, arabinose, mannose,
galactose, and glucose could act on McF-7 tumor cells of breast cancer,
promote the proliferation of spleen cells, and stimulate the immune
activity, thus inhibiting the growth of tumor cells.24 Moreover, in addition to direct antitumor activity, the
metabolism of amino acids and sugar derivatives provides small molecular
nutrients that are more readily absorbed by humans. The intake of
these amino acids and carbohydrate-derived nutrients will also enhance
human immunity, leading to an effective antitumor capacity.30 Due to the limitations of the current MS database,
the unknown compounds, which were the main candidate metabolites in
pr10, needed to be further studied in terms of metabolite identification.
Moreover, such unknown metabolites have potential direct and indirect
antitumor activities, which are helpful to make more rational use
of endophytic fungi. Based on these above-mentioned advantages, it
could be concluded that B. rapa L.
with its specific endophytic fungi and metabolites synthesized by
endophytic fungi could enhance the resistance of human beings in terms
of tumors and other biotic and abiotic stresses.

In addition
to the antitumor activity mentioned above, B. rapa L. has many other valuable characteristics
such as antioxidant function and free-radical scavenging.21 It is the first time that comparative metabolomics
was performed to systematically elucidate the antitumor mechanism
of endophytic fungi of B. rapa L.
The results manifested that B. rapa L. has unique kinds of endophytic fungi and such endophytic fungi
could directly inhibit the tumor cells with their various biochemical
metabolites. This research provides a theoretical basis and metabolic
fingerprint database, at the biochemical metabolic level, for better
use of B. rapa L. and its endophytic
fungi to develop antitumor agents and give direction for digging out
the potential value of antitumor medicinal plants at the biometabolic
level in the future.

5 Conclusions
In view
of the fact that previous experiments in vitro have proved
that pr10 has antitumor properties there are no reports on the metabolomics
of B. rapa L. endophytic fungi. Therefore,
in this experiment, the method of comparative metabolomics was used
to analyze the metabolomics of four strains of B. rapa L. endophytic fungi and the data were searched in the database.
The metabolites of four strains of fungi were compared statistically,
and the metabolism map of pr10 was drawn. The unique metabolites of
endophytic fungus pr10 are rich in amino acids and sugar derivatives
such as phenylalanine, d-arabitol, cellobiose, and trehalose.
These metabolites have potential antitumor activity, especially trehalose
whose antitumor activity on A549 has been reported.
