It
is highly challenging to detect the pathophysiology of the diseased
kidneys and achieve precise diagnosis because there are few in vivo
noninvasive imaging techniques to quantitatively assess kidney dysfunction.
This longstanding challenge is normally attributed to the limited
molecular contrast agents which can be addressed with renal clearable
nanoprobes. In this report, we demonstrate the use of magnetic resonance
imaging along with renal clearable ferric coordination polymer nanodots
(Fe-CPNDs) for in vivo monitoring the kidney dysfunction effects following
drug (daunomycin)-induced kidney injury. After intravenous injection
of Fe-CPNDs, the change of the MR signal in the kidney can be precisely
correlated with local pathological lesion which is demonstrated by
renal anatomic details and biochemical examinations of urine and blood.
This finding opens the door to the possibility of noninvasively assessing
kidney dysfunction and local injuries.

Introduction
Kidney injury/dysfunction
normally means serious diseases with
severe consequences.1−3 Intravital molecular imaging techniques are essential
tools in the diagnosis and therapy of renal diseases including pyelitis,
nephrolithiasis, and tumors.4−10 Currently, computed tomography (CT),4 ultrasound imaging,5 nuclear imaging,6 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)7 are widely used for both clinical diagnosis of
renal diseases and preclinical kidney function studies. Because of
the intrinsic insensitivities of CT/MRI technique modalities, high
dosages of contrast agents (CAs) (>60 mg kg–1 body
weight) are necessary for evaluation of the kidney function which
requires dynamic imaging of kidneys at high temporal resolution and
high contrast.11−13 For instance, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI)
has been proven as a powerful tool in the measurement of the single-kidney
glomerular filtration rate through monitoring the kidney clearance
kinetics (KCK) of gadolinium (Gd)-based CAs such as Magnevist (Gd–DTPA,
DTPA = diethylene triamine pentaacetate) and Dotarem [Gd(DOTA)·H2O, DOTA = 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic
acid]. Unfortunately, DCE-MRI suffers severely from the nephrotoxicity
of Gd-based CAs which are involved in the development of nephrogenic
systemic fibrosis in patients with reduced kidney function.14,15

Various inorganic/organic gadolinium-free nanoparticles (NPs)
with
ultrasmall (<7 nm) hydrodynamic diameters (HDs) have been arisen
as potential CAs for molecular imaging of the kidneys and are receiving
increased attention because of the possibility of three-dimensional
(3D) images with high spatial resolution and efficient renal clearance.16−21 Very recently, Zheng and coauthors have demonstrated that renal
clearable gold NPs (AuNPs)-based noninvasive X-ray imaging can be
used to precisely discern local pathological lesion in nephropathic
kidneys.21 In our previous study, we demonstrate
that ultrasmall poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)-protected Fe3+–gallic acid (GA) coordination polymer nanodots (Fe-CPNDs)
can be used as highly efficient T1 CAs
with strong MR enhancement and low toxicity.22 Unlike commercially available iron oxide CAs (e.g., Feridex I.V.)
which is metabolized by the liver, Fe-CPNDs are eliminated from body
through renal clearance. Although MRI is nonionizing radiation and
can produce noninvasive images with high spatial resolution anatomic
details based on soft-tissue contrast, there are few examples on the
applications of renal clearable NP-based MRI for studying kidney dysfunction.

Herein, the effect of daunomycin treatment on mice with renal injury
has been investigated by renal clearable Fe-CPNDs-based MRI because
the Fe-CPNDs exhibit remarkable kidney-positive signal enhancement
and increase significantly the imaging-time window. We found that
the extent of daunomycin-induced renal injury can be clearly defined
by the KCK of Fe-CPNDs.

Results and Discussion
Daunomycin-Induced Mouse
Kidney Injury Model
A single
dose of daunomycin (12 mg kg–1 body weight) was
injected through the tail vein in the Kunming mouse and/or the Balb/c
mouse to induce different degrees of renal injuries.23−26 Two mouse strains are used in this study because different outcomes
among mouse strains have been discovered in animal models of renal
injuries.27,28 After intravenous injection of daunomycin,
renal biochemical indicators measurements and histological analysis
show that all groups of mice have been induced to different degrees
of renal injuries (as shown in Figures 1, S1 and S2). In particular,
the degree of kidney injuries exhibits strong time dependence. For
instance, the amount of urinary protein in Kunming mouse urine is
increased from day 1 postinjection to day 42 postinjection and then
gradually decreased from day 42 postinjection to day 49 postinjection.
The amount of urinary protein in Balb/c mouse urine is increased from
day 1 postinjection to day 21 postinjection. The death of daunomycin-treated
Balb/c mice began to occur at day 22 postinjection. However, if Balb/c
mice were treated with continuous methylprednisolone sodium succinate
(0.125 mg kg–1 body weight per day, from day 14
to day 21 after injection of daunomycin), the amount of urinary protein
could be reduced and the survival rate of mice could be increased.
The survival rates of mice in different groups are shown in Figure S3. The result indicates that the daunomycin-induced
renal injuries in Kunming mice are self-healing, and the daunomycin-induced
renal injuries in Balb/c mice can be cured by methylprednisolone sodium
succinate treatment. On the basis of amounts of the urinary protein
in mice urines, Kunming mice at days 35 and 42 postinjection of daunomycin
are defined as mild kidney injury (termed as Kunming (+)) and severe
kidney injury [termed as Kunming (++)], respectively, while Balb/c
mice at days 14 and 21 postinjection of daunomycin are defined as
mild kidney injury [termed as Balb/c (+)] and severe kidney injury
[termed as Balb/c (++)], respectively. The self-healing Kunming mice
at day 49 postinjection of daunomycin and methylprednisolone sodium
succinate-cured Balb/c mice at day 28 postinjection of daunomycin
are named as Kunming (R) and Balb/c (R), respectively.

are shown as Kunming (C) and (d) Balb/c (C).

The histological analysis [hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
stains]
of kidneys with different degrees of injuries is shown in Figure 1c,d. Inflammatory
cell infiltration is clearly seen in Kunming (+) mice, while inflammatory
cell infiltration, glomerular fibrosis, and mesangial cell proliferation
are observed in Kunming (++) mice. Balb/c (+) mice have inflammatory
cell infiltration and mild hyaline degeneration, while Balb/c (++)
mice exhibit local degeneration and necrosis of renal tubular epithelial
cells, a large number of neutrophils infiltration, a large number
of neutrophils in renal tubules, infiltration of inflammatory cells
in the interstitium, and acute infection. The symptoms of Kunming
(R) and Balb/c (R) are slightly milder than those of Kunming (+) and
Balb/c (+). The results suggest that the mouse models with different
kidney injuries have been successfully established. In addition, these
daunomycin-induced mouse kidney injury models have also confirmed
by a blood routine test (as shown in Figure S1) and blood biochemical assays including serum creatinine assay and
blood urea nitrogen assay (as shown in Figure S2). According to clinical standard of renal injury state,
150% increase in creatinine is defined as risk, 200% increase in creatinine
is defined as injury, and 300% increase in creatinine is defined as
failure.

In Vivo MRI with Fe-CPND Probes
The Fe-CPNDs were synthesized
according to our previously reported strategy.22 The Fe-CPNDs can be used as T1-weighted MRI CAs with excellent renal clearance ability because
the Fe-CPNDs exhibit a low value of r2/r1 [i.e., the ratio of transverse relaxivity
(r2) to longitudinal relaxivity (r1) is ca. 1.9.], good monodispersity, and ultrasmall
HD (as shown in Figure S4). In addition,
the MRI time window could be significantly improved by the Fe-CPNDs
because the Fe-CPNDs exhibit long blood circulation half-lives (HLBC
≥ 1.0 h, as shown in Figure S4d).
For testing their accumulation and clearance in kidneys, the Fe-CPNDs
at a dose of 2 mg·kg–1 body weight were intravenously
injected into the healthy mice and mice with different degrees of
kidney injuries. The dose of Fe-CPNDs is determined by our previous
study.22 After injection of the Fe-CPNDs
at this dose, the MR signal enhancement of mouse kidneys can be clearly
observed. T1-weighted MR images were acquired
at preinjection and 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 h postinjection (as shown
in Figures 2, 3, S5 and S6). For all
of cases, the MR signals of kidneys are increased from 0 to 2 h postinjection,
while the MR signal decay begins at 2 h postinjection. This phenomenon
suggests that the Fe-CPNDs can effectively accumulate in the kidneys
and then be eliminated by kidneys. The maximal enhancement factor
of Fe-CPNDs is more than 3, which is equal to that of gadobutrol at
a dose of 67 mg·kg–1 body weight (containing
the Gd atoms as high as 12-time Fe atoms in the injected Fe-CPNDs),
a clinically used T1-weighted MRI CA,
under the same imaging conditions (as shown in Figure S7). However, the retention of Fe-CPNDs in the kidney
is much longer than that of gadobutrol (HLBC < 0.3 h29), which allows us to further quantify the clearance
kinetics of the NPs in the kidneys with different degrees of injuries.
In particular, the decay rate of the MR signal in the kidney is strongly
dependent on the degree of kidney injuries and follows the order Kunming
(C) > Kunming (R) > Kunming (+) > Kunming (++) and Balb/c
(C) > Balb/c
(R) > Balb/c (+) > Balb/c (++). For instance, MR signals in
both Kunming
(C) and Balb/c (C) can be recovered to the preinjection levels at
48 h postinjection. Compared with MR signals in kidneys at preinjection,
clearly contrast enhancements (>1.5 times) in Kunming (++) and
Balb/c
(++) can also be observed until 48 h postinjection. The result indicates
that the transport of Fe-CPNDs in the kidney indeed can be noninvasively
monitored at high contrast by in vivo MRI. The clearance kinetics
of Fe-CPNDs in different kidneys are used to evaluate the renal function
because the elimination of Fe-CPND is significantly slowed down in
the dysfunctional kidney. The degree of kidney injuries can be semi-quantitatively
analyzed by comparing the decay half-lives (DHL) of the time-dependent
MR density curves derived from kidneys in both the Balb/c mouse group
and Kunming mouse group (as shown in Figure 3). For instance,
DHL (>35 h) of the mouse with severe kidney injury is much longer
than that (<20 h) of the mouse with mild kidney injury. In addition,
such differentiation of renal injury cannot be achieved with gadobutrol-enhanced
in vivo MRI (as shown in Figure S7).

Figure 2 In vivo T1-weighted MR images of the
kidneys (indicated by red ellipses) with different degrees of injuries
[(a) Balb/c (C), (b) Balb/c (+), (c) Balb/c (++), and (d) Balb/c (R)]
after the intravenous injection of Fe-CPNDs at different time intervals
(0 h indicates preinjection). The mice were intravenously injected
with Fe-CPNDs at a dose of 2 mg·kg–1 body weight.

Figure 3 Change of relative MR density as function of
postinjection time.
The curves derived from kidneys in both (a) Kunming mouse group and
(b) Balb/c mouse group. Error bars mean standard derivations (n = 5). The MR densities of kidneys at preinjection (0 h)
were defined as 1. Insets are corresponding DHLs which are counted
from 2 h postinjection (the time point of maximal MR enhancement).

The clearance kinetics of the
NPs in the kidneys with different
degrees of injuries were further confirmed by determination of the
Fe element in mouse urine and Prussian blue (PB)-stained kidney tissue.
After a single intravenous injection of Fe-CPNDs at a dose of 2 mg
Fe kg–1 body weight, total amounts of the Fe element
in the urine of mice at selected time points of postinjection were
measured by ICP-MS. As shown in Figure 4, the total amount of Fe in urine is increasing over
time. The half excretion time (HET) of Fe-CPNDs is dependent on the
degree of kidney injuries, that is, the mouse with severely injured
kidney has a much longer HET than those of mouse with mildly injured
kidney and health mouse. PB histochemical staining, which is selective
for ferric ions, was performed to detect the iron content in the kidney
sections. In this case, Fe-CPNDs can be directly visualized by a blue
hue. Figure S8 shows pronounced differences
between the injured kidney section and the health kidney section at
24 h postinjection of Fe-CPNDs. The PB-stained of kidney tissue provides
further evidence of the retention of Fe-CPNDs in the injured kidney.

(n = 5).

Conclusions
In summary, noninvasive dynamic MRI of
renal clearable Fe-CPNDs
has proven to be a powerful tool in the quantitative measurement of
the degree of kidney injuries because Fe-CPNDs have several desired
in vivo behaviors including high T1-weighted
MR contrast ability, efficient kidney accumulation, and long retention
in the blood. Well-defined daunomycin-induced kidney injury mouse
models were chosen here to demonstrate this new Fe-CPND-based dynamic
MRI strategy by proof-of-principle experiments. However, our method
shows great promise for noninvasive evaluate kidney function in kidney
diseases including chronic kidney disease because it circumvents the
nephrotoxicity and the narrow imaging-time window of gadolinium ion-based
MRI CAs (e.g., gadobutrol and Magnevist) which are usually clinically
used.

Experimental Section
Materials
GA (99%), iron(III) chloride
hexahydrate
(FeCl3·6H2O), and PVP (molecular weight:
8000 g mol–1) were obtained from Alfa Aesar (Ward
Hill, USA). Creatinine (Cr) assay kit (sarcosine oxidase method),
urea nitrogen assay kit, and urine protein assay kit were obtained
from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China).
Daunomycin hydrochloride was obtained from Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang, China). Methylprednisolone sodium succinate was
obtained from Guoyao Group Rongsheng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Henan,
China). All other reagents were analytical grade and used without
further purification. Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm) was used in
all experiments.

Preparation of Fe-CPNDs and Mouse Kidney
Injury Model
The Fe-CPNDs were synthesized according to our
previously reported
strategy (see the Supporting Information for details).22

All animal experiments
before initiation were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at Jilin University. All MRI and surgical procedures
were processed under intraperitoneal anesthesia using chloral hydrate
(0.25 mg·kg–1 body weight). The healthy female
Kunming mice and Balb/c mice (average mass of about 20 g) were purchased
from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. (Beijing,
China). The mice were fed in a clean animal laboratory with a 12 h/12
h light/dark cycle at 18–22 °C. In all animal experiments,
the healthy mice were used as the control group. After adaptive feeding
for one week, the mice were injected with a single dose of daunomycin
(12 mg kg–1 body weight) through the tail vein.
The mice were then divided into several groups (5 mice per group),
and each group was tested at different times to obtain different degrees
of kidney injuries. After injection of daunomycin, part of the mice
were sacrificed at day 35, day 42, and day 49 (for Kunming mice) and/or
at day 14, day 21, and day 28 (for Balb/c mice). The kidneys were
collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for pathological
analysis. The (H&E-stained or PB-stained) histological sections
of kidneys were observed under an optical microscope. For the treatment
of the Balb/c mice with kidney injury, methylprednisolone sodium succinate
was administered intraperitoneally at 0.125 mg·kg–1 body weight every day from day 14 to day 21 after daunomycin injection.

For examination of renal biochemical indicators, the urine and
blood were collected at day 35, day 42, and day 49 (for Kunming mice)
and at day 14, day 21, and day 28 (for Balb/c mice) postinjection
of daunomycin. The urinary protein, serum creatinine, and blood urea
nitrogen were measured with commercial assay kits.

In Vivo MRI
At day 35, day 42, and day 49 (for Kunming
mice) and at day 14, day 21, and day 28 (for Balb/c mice) postinjection
of daunomycin, 100 μL of Fe-CPNDs (2 mg·kg–1 body weight) was injected intravenously into different groups of
mice. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane during scanning. T1-weighted MR images were acquired at 1, 2,
4, 6, 24, and 48 h after injection of Fe-CPNDS by the Philips Achieva
3.0T MRI scanner. The following imaging parameters were used including
0.5 mm (slice thickness), 15 ms (TE), 358 ms (TR), 0.8 mm (in-plane
resolution), and 144 mm × 144 mm (field of view).

In Vivo Pharmacokinetics
and Metabolism
At day 35,
day 42, and day 49 (for Kunming mice) and at day 14, day 21, and day
28 (for Balb/c mice) postinjection of daunomycin, 100 μL of
Fe-CPNDs (2 mg·kg–1 body weight) was injected
intravenously into different groups of mice. The mice were sacrificed
at 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 h after injection of Fe-CPNDs. The amounts
of Fe nanodots in kidney, blood (collected by the abdominal aortic
method), and urine (taken from bladder) of mice were measured by ICP-MS.
As a control, the amounts of Fe in the blood, urine, and kidneys of
healthy mice were also determined after injection.
