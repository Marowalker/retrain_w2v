This work documents the first palladium
pincer complex-catalyzed
carbonylative Sonogashira (CS) and carbonylative Suzuki–Miyaura
(CSM) cross-coupling. Compared to previous protocols, which employ
hazardous and toxic solvents, the aminophosphine pincer complex {[C6H3-2,6-(NHP{piperidinyl}2)2]Pd(Cl)} (III) catalyzes both the cross-coupling reactions
in propylene carbonate, an eco-friendly and sustainable polar aprotic
solvent. Advantageously, employing III allows the CS
cross-coupling to be carried out at a palladium loading of 10–4 mol % and the CSM cross-coupling to be carried out
at 10–6 mol %, thus resulting in catalytic turnovers
of 105 and 107, respectively. Relative comparison
of the pincer complex with conventional palladium precursors Pd(OAc)2 and PdCl2(PPh3)2 shows the
efficiency and robustness of the pincer complex in effecting higher
catalytic activity at low palladium loadings.

Introduction
The
development of protocols for the synthesis of biaryl ketones
and ynones (α,β-acetylenic ketones) is extremely significant
in synthetic organic chemistry.1

Biaryl ketones represent key structural motifs present in pharmaceutical
drugs, sunscreen agents, and natural products. Ynones, on the other
hand, are central building blocks present in biologically active molecules
and are key intermediates in the synthesis of different heterocyclic
functionalities and natural products (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Representative examples of important molecules
containing the biaryl
ketone and ynone functionality.

Traditionally, biaryl ketones are synthesized through the
Friedel–Crafts
acylation, which is driven by utilizing stoichiometric amount of Lewis
acid.2 The presence of Lewis acid causes
compatibility issues with functional groups and generation of large
amounts of waste, thus resulting in poor atom economy. The lack of
regioselectivity in accessing ortho and para isomers, their separation,
synthesis of biaryl ketones with meta substitution, and electron-withdrawing
functionalities are additional drawbacks associated with the Friedel–Crafts
acylation. Ynones are conventionally synthesized by reacting acid
chlorides with alkynyl organometallic reagents3−7 or by the transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling
between terminal alkynes and acid chlorides.8−11 Given the reactive nature of
acid chlorides, these protocols suffer from poor functional group
tolerance and poor atom economy. The palladium-catalyzed three-component
carbonylative cross-coupling between aryl halide and aryl boronic
acid12,13 [carbonylative Suzuki–Miyaura (CSM)]
or terminal alkyne14,15 [carbonylative Sonogashira (CS)]
using carbon monoxide as a C1 source is a straightforward and convenient
strategy for synthesizing biaryl ketones and ynones, respectively.
Both these reaction protocols are atom-economic and have wide functional
group tolerance. The fact that alkynes and aryl boronic acids are
nontoxic and air-, moisture-, and thermally stable is an added advantage
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Comparison
of Different Reaction Protocols for the Synthesis of Biaryl
Ketones (a) and Ynones (b)
The synthesis of biaryl ketones and ynones from aryl halides
and
pseudohalides through the CSM and CS cross-coupling using a range
of homogenous and heterogeneous palladium catalysts is well documented.13,16−33,15,34−49 However, to drive a carbonylative cross-coupling, typically higher
palladium loadings are necessary. Noncarbonylative cross-coupling
reactions, on the other hand, can be driven more efficiently and smoothly
at lower palladium loadings. In fact, even a 50 ppb palladium contamination
in commercially available sodium carbonate catalyzes the Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling of aryl bromides.50 Thus,
higher catalytic turnover numbers (TONs) and turnover frequencies
(TOFs) are generally observed in the case of noncarbonylative cross-coupling
reactions compared to carbonylative cross-coupling reactions. This
is due to the fact that, in carbonylative cross-coupling reactions,
excess of π-acidic CO is present compared to palladium. The
reactivity of palladium toward oxidative addition of the aryl halide
is greatly reduced due to binding of CO with palladium. Moreover,
facile aggregation of palladium atoms in the presence of CO leads
to the formation of nonactive palladium species, thereby reducing
the catalytic activity. Thus, achieving high catalytic TONs and TOFs
through low palladium loadings in carbonylative cross-coupling reactions
is challenging.

It is however essential to use palladium in
minimum quantities
given its high cost and to reduce the existing metal contamination
in the environment. Additionally, since biaryl ketone and ynone synthesis
forms part of the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industry, it is
essential to reduce the contamination of palladium in the end product
down to the ppm level.

Palladacyclic complexes have been exhaustively
reported as high-turnover
catalysts for noncarbonylative cross-coupling reactions.51−65 They are known to catalyze reactions at extremely low palladium
loadings, thus resulting in high catalytic turnovers and, in some
cases, enzymatic turnovers.66 However,
they have been seldom reported as high-turnover palladium precursors
for carbonylative cross-coupling reactions.67−71 In 2015, we reported Bedford’s mixed tricyclohexylphosphine–triarylphosphite
palladacyclic complex (Figure 2, I) as a high-turnover catalyst for the CSM
cross-coupling of aryl iodides.72 Notably,
the reaction could be carried out using 10–6 mol
% of palladium and catalytic turnovers of the order of 107 were observed. Recently, we have also documented oxime palladacycle
(Figure 2, II) as a robust and high-turnover catalyst for the CS cross-coupling
of aryl iodides.73 The reaction could be
driven using a palladium loading of 10–3 mol %,
resulting in catalytic turnovers of the order of 104.

Figure 2 High catalytic
turnover palladacyclic (I), (II) and pincer
complex (III), (IV).

Palladacycles are cyclic palladium complexes incorporating
at least
a single carbon–palladium bond. Pincers belong to the family
of palladacycles and incorporate two fused palladacycles. In the 1970s,
Shaw,74 Noltes,75 and van Koten75 first reported the synthesis
of pincer complexes. Over the years, many pincer complexes have been
synthesized and their multifaceted catalytic applications systematically
documented.76−84 However, the NCN, PCP, and SCS pincer complexes are the most common
as they can be easily synthesized from palladium sources, which are
commonly used. In 2000, Bedford and co-workers reported the first
bis(phosphinite)-based PCP palladium pincer complex as a high-turnover
catalyst for the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of aryl bromides
and chlorides.85 A maximum TON of 190 000
could be achieved in the case of aryl bromides. In 2007 and 2010,
Frech and co-workers reported the aminophosphine palladium pincer
complexes (Figure 2, III and IV) for the Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling of aryl bromides and chlorides.86,87 Advantageously, while using complex III, the aryl bromides
could be coupled between 5 and 30 min at a catalyst loading of 10–3 mol %, thus resulting in maximum catalytic turnovers
of 105 and activated aryl chlorides could be coupled within
180 min at a catalyst loading of 0.1 mol %, resulting in maximum turnovers
of 103. The same group reported the palladium pincer-catalyzed
Sonogashira cross-coupling under additive- and amine-free conditions.88 A range of electronically deactivated, sterically
hindered, and functionalized aryl iodides and aryl bromides were coupled
with several alkynes at low catalyst loadings and short reaction times,
wherein maximum catalytic turnovers of 106 were observed,
while using complex III. Both the complexes can be readily
synthesized from dichloro(bis(1,1′,1″-(phosphinetriyl)tripiperidine))palladium
as a template and 1,3-diaminobenzene or resorcinol to generate the
aromatic pincer core at the palladium center. The protocol does not
require the need for synthesis and purification of air- and moisture-sensitive
ligand systems and hence represents a facile, short, and high-yielding
methodology for the synthesis of the pincer complex from inexpensive
starting materials. Both the complexes are thermally stable up to
150 °C and do not undergo any decomposition in an oxygen atmosphere
for more than a week.

After a comprehensive literature survey,
we found that, to the
best of our knowledge, palladium-based pincer complexes have not been
reported as precatalysts for the CSM and CS cross-coupling. We also
found that both the aforementioned reactions have been typically carried
out in hydrocarbon solvents (anisole or toluene), dioxane, dimethylacetamide
(DMA), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), N,N-dimethylformamide (N,N-DMF), and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Although the reactions
proceed efficiently in these solvents, amide, ethereal, and hydrocarbon
solvents are hazardous, toxic, and unsustainable. In present-day chemistry,
the effect of reaction solvents on health, safety, and environment
needs a meticulous examination. In the course of time, there will
be constraint and restriction on production of solvents and their
usage under Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction
of CHemicals (REACH89)—a regulation
passed by the European Union. Hence, we envisaged in identifying an
alternate sustainable solvent for both the reactions.

Organic
cyclic carbonates are environmentally friendly solvents
in synthetic chemistry as they are nontoxic, biodegradable, odorless,
and possess low vapor pressure.90−96 Inexpensive, industrial-scale, and sustainable methodologies for
their synthesis from renewable feedstocks have been established.97−99 Ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate (Figure 3) have been rated good to excellent, showing
points of no concern, when benchmarked across various parameters,
by the GlaxoSmithKline solvent selection guide.100 Moreover, ethylene and propylene carbonate have higher
boiling points compared to amide (N,N-DMF and DMA), ethereal (dioxane, MTBE, and THF), and hydrocarbon
(anisole and toluene) solvents. This not only results in lower atmospheric
emissions, but also makes them safe to handle and store. Further,
since organic cyclic carbonates are made up of only carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur are not produced and emitted
on their combustion or incineration.

Figure 3 Structures of ethylene carbonate (A) and
propylene carbonate (B).

Carbonylation reactions are known to proceed efficiently
in cyclic
carbonates. This is mainly attributed to the high solubility of CO
in cyclic carbonates. Okamoto’s group has done extensive research
on the application of propylene carbonate as an advantageous solvent
for the synthesis of polycarbonates by oxidative carbonylation of
bisphenol A.101−103 Propylene carbonate is also known to stabilize
palladium clusters/colloidal palladium accessible from bulk palladium104 and has been applied for Sonogashira cross-coupling
of aryl chlorides105 and cyclocarbonylation
reactions.106 Recently, we have reported
the Pd/C-catalyzed phenoxycarbonylation of aryl iodides under CO surrogacy
in propylene carbonate as a sustainable solvent.107 Taking into consideration our continued interest in developing
high-turnover catalysts and identifying environmentally benign and
sustainable solvents for carbonylation reactions, we herein report
the first aminophosphine pincer complex-catalyzed carbonylative Suzuki–Miyaura
and carbonylative Sonogashira cross-coupling in propylene carbonate
(Scheme 2).

Carbonylative
Sonogashira Cross-Coupling
We initiated
the reaction optimization by monitoring the carbonylative cross-coupling
between iodobenzene 1a and phenylacetylene 2a, resulting in the synthesis of 1,3-diphenylprop-2-yn-1-one 3a in toluene using 0.1 mol % pincer complex III (Table 1).

The effect of CO pressure and base revealed that the reaction proceeded
with 99% conversion and 96% selectivity when a CO pressure of 2 bar
was applied and K2CO3 was taken as the base.
Other inorganic (Na2CO3 and K3PO4) and organic bases (Et3N, TMEDA) gave inferior
results (Table 1, entries
1–3 and 4–8). The solvent study showed that the reaction
proceeded well in toluene, with slightly decreased selectivity observed
in the case of N,N-DMF and dioxane
(Table 1, entries 9–11).
Delightfully, the former hazardous solvents could be avoided, as the
reaction proceeded well in ethylene and propylene carbonate (Table 1, entries 12 and 13).
Propylene carbonate being a liquid at room temperature was chosen
as the solvent of choice. The time and temperature study showed that
a reaction time of 5 h and a temperature of 100 °C are required
for achieving maximum conversion and selectivity (Table 1, entries 14–20).

Having optimized the reaction conditions, we focussed our attention
on the effect of catalyst loading (Table 2).

The catalyst loading study showed
that, as the palladium loading
is decreased from 10–1 to 10–4 mol %, the conversion of 1a drastically drops from
99 to 52%. This resulted in catalytic TONs and TOFs of 105 and 104, respectively (Table 2, entries 1–4). The conversion and
selectivity toward 3a at palladium loading of 10–4 mol % could be increased by carrying out the reaction
at 120 °C for 8 h (Table 2, entry 5). Further decrease in palladium loading drastically
brings down the conversion and selectivity, although a catalytic TON
of 106 could be observed (Table 2, entry 6). Subsequently, we studied the
scope of substrates that could be synthesized at low palladium loadings
under the optimized conditions (Table 3).

Aromatic ring with electron-releasing substitutent (ortho- and para-OCH3) could be smoothly coupled
with phenylacetylene and N,N-dimethyl-substituted
phenylacetylene to furnish the products 3b and 3c in 76 and 84% yields, respectively (Table 3, entries 1 and 2). Polyaromatic naphthyl
ynones 3d–f could be synthesized
in 81, 85, and 79%, yields respectively (Table 3, entries 3–5). Incidentally, aliphatic
cyclic alkyne-cyclopropylacetylene could also be coupled with 1-iodonaphthalene
to afford the ynone 3g in 74% yield (Table 3, entry 6). Aromatic ring with
electron-withdrawing substituents (para-Cl and ortho-Cl) could be coupled resulting in ynones 3h and 3i in 82 and 78% yields, respectively. Ynone 3j could be synthesized in 75% yield by coupling 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene
and 4-fluorophenylacetylene (Table 3, entry 9). However, aromatic ring bearing strong electron-withdrawing
substituents (para-nitro and cyano) could not be
carbonylatively coupled to afford the corresponding ynones and only
the corresponding noncarbonylative cross-coupling products were obtained.
Increasing the palladium loading to 10–1 mol % and
CO pressure to 8 bar did not result in the synthesis of the ynone.
However, delightfully, on applying low palladium loading and under
a CO pressure of 2 bar, heteroaromatic thiophene-containing ynones 3k–n could be synthesized in 68–86%
yields (Table 3, entries
10–13). Attempts to carbonylatively couple the challenging
ortho-disubstituted aryl iodide failed under the optimized condition.
However, increasing the palladium loading to 10–1 mol % resulted in a 19% yield of the ynone 3o (Table 3, entry 14). The tetramethoxy
ynone 3p could be synthesized in 87% yield from 5-iodo-1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene
and 4-methoxyphenylacetylene (Table 3, entry 15).

Carbonylative Suzuki–Miyaura Cross-Coupling
Next, we turned our attention to optimize the reaction conditions
for the carbonylative cross-coupling between iodobenzene 1a and phenylboronic acid 4a, leading to the synthesis
of benzophenone 5a in anisole using 0.1 mol % of pincer
complex III (Table 4).

The CO pressure and base screening
showed that the reaction could
be advantageously carried out at atmospheric pressure of CO and that
K2CO3 gives superior conversion and selectivity
compared to other inorganic and organic bases (Table 4, entries 1–7). It is well a well-known
fact that the carbonylative Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling proceeds
well in nonpolar solvents. In polar aprotic solvents like N,N-DMF, formation of the corresponding
carboxylic acid is observed.13 The solvent
screening showed that the reaction proceeds well in anisole and dioxane
with lower values of selectivity observed in N,N-DMF (Table 4, entries 8–10). However, to our delight, the reaction proceeded
efficiently in ethylene and propylene carbonate as alternate polar
aprotic solvents (Table 4, entries 11 and 12). The time and temperature screening revealed
that the reaction could be carried out at 100 °C in 3 h with
a 95% conversion and 94% selectivity (Table 4, entries 13–19).

We subsequently
proceeded to study the effect of catalyst loading
(Table 5). The palladium
loading could be decreased up to 10–5 mol %, resulting
in a conversion and selectivity of 81 and 89%, respectively, and catalytic
turnovers of the order of 106 at 100 °C for 3 h (Table 5, entries 1–5).

Bringing down the palladium loading
from 10–5 to 10–6 mol % results
in a drastic decrease in
conversion (Table 5, entry 6). However, increasing the reaction temperature and time
to 120 °C and 5 h, respectively, resulted in a conversion of
85%. To our delight, a catalytic turnover of 107 was observed
(Table 5, entry 7).
Decreasing the palladium loading further leads to a decrease in conversion,
although resulting in a catalytic TON of 108 (Table 5, entry 8).

Next, we screened the scope of substrates that could be synthesized
through the CSM cross-coupling catalyzed by the pincer complex (Table 6).

The CSM cross-coupling
of aryl iodides bearing electron-withdrawing
substituents is known to undergo biaryl formation without the insertion
of CO.108 However, we observed that aryl
iodide bearing a para- and meta-nitro
substituent could be smoothly coupled with 4-cyanophenylboronic acid
and 4-flurophenylboronic acid leading to the synthesis of biaryl ketones 5b and 5c in 81 and 82% yields, respectively
(Table 6, entries 1
and 2). 1-Bromo-4-iodobenzene and 4-iodobenzonitrile could be coupled
with 4-fluorophenylboronic acid to afford ketones 5d and 5e in 77 and 79% yields, respectively (Table 6, entries 3 and 4). Ketone 5f, bearing a meta-fluoro and para-cyano substituent, 5g, bearing a meta-fluoro and methylenedioxy unit, and 5h, bearing difluoro
and biphenyl functionality could be synthesized in 73, 84, and 80%
yields, respectively (Table 6, entries 5–7). Polyaromatic, naphthyl biaryl ketones 5i and 5j could be synthesized from 1-iodonaphthalene
in 83 and 78% yields, respectively (Table 6, entries 8 and 9). Polyhalogenated ketones 5k and 5l could be synthesized in 75 and 76%
yields, respectively (Table 6, entries 10 and 11). The more challenging ortho-disubstituted
ketone 5m could be synthesized from 2-iodo-meta-xylene in 68% yield, incorporating a palladium loading of 10–2 mol % (Table 6, entry 12). Notably, under a CO pressure of 1 bar and palladium
loading of 10–6 mol %, heteroaromatic thiophene-containing
ketones 5n and 5o could be synthesized in
82 and 81%, yields (Table 6, entries 13 and 14).

To demonstrate the practical applicability
of the developed protocol,
(4-methoxyphenyl)(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methanone (5p)—an antineoplastic, and benzophenone-3 (oxybenzone) (5q)—a sunscreen agent, were synthesized. (4-Methoxyphenyl)(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methanone
is a cytotoxic compound belonging to the phenstatin family, which
causes cell apoptosis by inhibiting tubulin polymerization.109−113 Oxybenzone is a photostabilizer and photoprotective agent capable
of absorbing UVB and short-wave UVA rays, thus providing a broad-spectrum
protection against UV ray damage.1 The
CSM cross-coupling of 5-iodo-1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene with 4-methoxyphenylboronic
acid resulted in the synthesis of 5p in 78% yield. On
the other hand, oxybenzone could be synthesized in 65% yield by carbonylatively
cross-coupling 2-iodo-5-methoxyphenol with phenylboronic acid (Scheme 3). Synthesis of 5p and 5q could be carried out resulting in catalytic
turnovers of 105 and 104, respectively.

Comparison of Catalytic Activity
Next, we carried out
a comparative study of the palladium pincer complex (III) with conventional palladium sources Pd(OAc)2 and PdCl2(PPh3)2 as well as with oxime palladacycle
(II) for CS cross-coupling and with Bedford’s
palladacycle (I) for the CSM cross-coupling (Table 7). In the case of
CS cross-coupling, at 10–4 mol % palladium loading,
the pincer exhibits a conversion and selectivity of 85 and 95%, respectively,
compared to Pd(OAc)2 (5 and 32%) and PdCl2(PPh3)2 (11 and 41%) (Table 7, entries 1, 2, and 5). In the case of CSM
cross-coupling, at 10–6 mol % palladium loading,
the pincer effects a conversion and selectivity of 84 and 91%, respectively,
compared to Pd(OAc)2 (6 and 21%) and PdCl2(PPh3)2 (18 and 32%) (Table 7, entries 7, 8, and 11). The catalytic TONs
thus observed in the case of pincer catalysis in CS cross-coupling
are 50 and 17 times greater than those observed in the case of Pd(OAc)2 and PdCl2(PPh3)2, respectively.
In the case of CSM cross-coupling, they are 63 and 13 times greater
than those observed for Pd(OAc)2 and PdCl2(PPh3)2, respectively. The combination of Pd(OAc)2 with amine ligands 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and ethylenediamine
for the CS and CSM cross-coupling results in better values of conversion
and selectivity compared to only using Pd(OAc)2. However,
the catalytic activity still falls short of what the pincer complex
achieves (Table 7,
entries 3, 4, 9, and 10). Notably, both the cross-coupling reactions
could be carried out in gram scale (5 mmol) without any change in
catalytic activity (Table 7, entries 6 and 12).

Mechanistic Insight
To gain insight
into the reaction
mechanism, a time-dependent conversion study was carried out for both
the cross-coupling reactions using 0.1 mol % III at 100
°C. When conversion was plotted as a function of time, we observed
sigmoidal-shaped curves114 and a 60 min
induction period in the case of CS cross-coupling and a 30 min induction
period in the case of CSM cross-coupling (Figure 4). Moreover, the addition of 15 mol % tetra-n-butylammonium bromide, a salt which stabilizes palladium
nanoparticles in catalytic reactions,114 leads to a drastic drop in conversion and catalytic activity. These
results strongly point to the formation of heterogeneous palladium
species (palladium nanoparticles/nanoclusters or colloidal palladium),
resulting from the decomposition of the pincer architecture due to
the reducing nature of gaseous CO.115

To isolate and characterize the heterogeneous palladium
species
formed in situ, the CSM cross-coupling reaction of 1a and 4a was carried out using 4.6 mol % (∼15
mg) of III for 5 h. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged
at 10 000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant propylene carbonate
was decanted carefully and the black residue was washed with water
and ethanol and characterized by field-emission gun (FEG)-scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 1, Supporting Information), energy-dispersive spectrometry
(Figure 2, Supporting
Information), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM),
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

HR-TEM analysis
(Figure 5) reveals

agglomeration.

Formation of palladium nanoparticles with an average particle
size
of about 6.5 nm was observed. The XPS study (Figure 6) reveals binding energies of 336.3 and 341.4
eV corresponding to the Pd(0) 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 energy levels. The pincer thus acts as a reservoir and dispenses
highly energetic palladium nanoparticles under the reaction conditions.
Hence, the reaction mechanism proceeds through the classical Pd(0)/Pd(II)
redox pathway (Figure 7).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, through this work, we have established the first
pincer complex-catalyzed carbonylative Sonogashira (CS) and carbonylative
Suzuki–Miyaura (CSM) cross-coupling in propylene carbonate
as an eco-friendly aprotic solvent. Advantageously, applying the aminophosphine
palladium pincer complex (III) as the precatalyst allowed
the CS cross-coupling to be carried out at a palladium loading of
10–4 mol % and the CSM cross-coupling to be carried
out at 10–6 mol %, thus resulting in catalytic turnovers
of the order of 105 and 107, respectively. A
range of biaryl ketones and ynones could be synthesized, including
the synthesis of an antineoplastic and a photostabilizer cum photoprotective
agent. The comparison of the palladium pincer complex (III) with conventional palladium precursors Pd(OAc)2 and
PdCl2(PPh3)2 shows the superiority
and robustness of the pincer complex in effecting higher catalytic
activity at lower palladium loadings.

The plot of the time-dependent
conversion study showed a brief
induction period with a sigmoidal-shaped curve. Addition of tetra-n-butylammonium bromide resulted in a decrease in the catalytic
activity, thus indicating the formation of heterogeneous palladium
species from the pincer architecture. The isolation and characterization
of the in situ formed heterogeneous palladium species revealed the
formation of Pd(0) nanoparticles with narrow particle size distribution
and an average particle size of 6.5 nm. Hence, both the carbonylative
cross-coupling reactions proceed through the classical Pd(0)/Pd(II)
pathway. Thus, the combination of low palladium loadings and high
catalytic turnovers through the application of the palladium pincer
complex as a precatalyst in propylene carbonate represents a sustainable
process for the synthesis of biaryl ketones and ynones.

Experimental
Section
General
The aminophosphine palladium pincer complex
(III) was sourced from Sigma-Aldrich and was used as
received. All chemicals and solvents were sourced from different commercial
vendors and used as received without any additional purification.
Catalyst stock solutions dissolved in propylene carbonate of varying
concentrations (10–1–10–10 mol %) were made by taking known catalyst concentration (1 mol %),
which was followed by successive dilutions of the initial catalyst
solution. Special precautions for the preparation of the catalyst
stock solutions were not taken, and the catalysts were handled in
air. The progress of the reaction was monitored by GC–MS and
thin-layer chromatography using Merck silica gel 60 F254 plates. The
reaction products were visualized with a 254 nm UV lamp. The GC–MS-QP
2010 instrument (Rtx-17, 30 m × 25 mm ID, film thickness (df)
= 0.25 μm) (column flow, 2 mL min–1; 100–240
°C at 10 °C min–1 rise) was used for the
mass analysis of the products. Purification of the products was carried
out by column chromatography on 100–200 mesh silica gel. The
1H NMR spectra were recorded on 500 MHz spectrometers in CDCl3 using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. The 13C NMR spectra were recorded on 125 MHz spectrometers in CDCl3. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (δ)
relative to tetramethylsilane as an internal standard, and J (coupling constant) values were reported in hertz. The
splitting patterns of protons are described as s (singlet), d (doublet),
dd (doublet of doublets), t (triplet), and m (multiplet). Field emission
gun high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (300 kV) was
carried out on Tecnai (FEI) G2, F30 instrument. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy was carried out on AXIS Supra (Kratos Analytical, U.K.).

Typical Procedure for Carbonylative Sonogashira Cross-Coupling
Aryl iodide (0.5 mmol), phenylacetylene (0.6 mmol), [Pd, III] (10–4 mol %), and K2CO3 (1.0 mmol) in 10 mL of propylene carbonate were added to
a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave. Subsequently, the autoclave was
closed and flushed three times with CO. The autoclave was then pressurized
with CO to 2 bar (∼30 psi) at ambient temperature. The reaction
mixture was stirred with a mechanical stirrer (450 rpm) at 120 °C
for 8 h. The pressure was carefully released after cooling to room
temperature. To remove traces of product, the reactor vessel was washed
with ethyl acetate (3 × 5 mL). The ethyl acetate layer was washed
with water (2 × 5 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated by rotary evaporation to obtain the crude product.
The crude product was subjected to purification by column chromatography
(silica gel, 100–200 mesh size), with petroleum ether–ethyl
acetate as the eluent, to yield the pure product.

steel autoclave.

In both the cases, the autoclave was closed
and flushed with CO three times. The autoclave was then pressurized
with CO to 1 bar (∼15 psi) at ambient temperature. The reaction
mixture was stirred with a mechanical stirrer (450 rpm) at 120 °C
for 5 h. The pressure was carefully released after cooling to room
temperature. To remove traces of product, the reactor vessel was washed
