The
presence of highly modifiable chemical functional groups, abundance
of functional groups, and their biological origin make proteins an
important class of biomaterials from a fundamental science and applied
engineering perspective. Hence, the utilization of proteins from the
animal rendering industry (animal protein, AP) for high-value, nonfeed,
and nonfertilizer applications is intensely pursued. Although this
leads to the exploration of protein-derived plastics as a plausible
alternative, the proposed methods are energy-intensive and not based
on protein in its native form, which leads to high processing and
production costs. Here, we propose, for the first time, novel pathways
to develop engineered hybrid systems utilizing AP in its native form
and epoxy resins with mechanical properties ranging from toughened
thermosets to elastic epoxy-based systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate
the capability to engineer the properties of epoxy–AP hybrids
from high-strength hybrids to elastic films through controlling the
interaction, hydrophilicity, as well as the extent of cross-linking
and network density. Through the facile introduction of cochemicals,
a sevenfold increase in the mechanical properties of the conventional
epoxy–AP hybrid is achieved. Similarly, because of better compatibility
afforded by the similar hydrophilicity, AP demonstrated higher cross-linking
capability with a water-soluble epoxy (WEP) matrix, resulting in an
elastic WEP–AP hybrid without any external aid.

Introduction
The accelerated depletion
of nonrenewable petroleum reserves and
a significant concern over environmental problems such as “white
pollution” have driven a universal movement toward the concept
of “sustainable development”.1 The push toward such a sustainable cyclical economy will involve
the production of biobased polymers and composites that will substitute
their petroleum-based counterparts.1−3 Hence, renewable resourced
polymers and composites are projected to be the future of green economy
owing to their renewability, low cost, and tantamount characteristics.4−11 In most cases, biobased materials incorporate industrial products,
while avoiding the use of food, feed, or materials produced from renewable
agricultural and forestry feedstock, such as wood, wood wastes, and
residues, grasses, or crop wastes. Among various plausible underutilized
renewable and natural materials, proteins demand greater attention.
The intricate internal structure, abundance of functional groups,
and surface chemistry of proteins make them ideal candidates for a
multitude of applications.12−14 However, the use of such proteinaceous
materials, particularly the ones obtained from the rendering industry,
is mostly confined to low volume and economic value applications.
This led to extensive research in recent times toward finding suitable,
alternate, nonfeed, and nonfertilizer applications for such proteinaceous
materials. A potential surrogate use for proteins derived from the
rendering industry (termed animal protein or AP hereafter) has emerged
in the form of producing plastics and composites. For example, the
complex inter- and intramolecular couplings present in solidified
protein residues can be capitalized on to designing materials and
plastics with enhanced stiffness. Similar to carbon black, proteins
are known to aggregate and form reinforcing networks when integrated
into elastomers and rubbers.8 The interconnected
matrix formation capacity of proteins leads to their use in packaging,13−15 composites,16 regenerated fibers,17 and adhesives.18 However,
a complex interdigitated network of proteins erected through hydrogen
bonding, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, as well as disulfide
bonding also results in stiff and brittle structures.19 Although chemical modification and plasticization allow
the creation of more processable and useful materials,20 they also lead to inferior mechanical properties
(e.g., simultaneous reduction in stiffness and strength and enhancement
in extensibility). Moreover, the high moisture absorption (which is
aggravated by the use of hydrophilic plasticizers) and the inherent
order associated with certain proteinaceous materials in conjugation
with ordinary mechanical properties limit the widespread use of proteins,
especially in high-performance structural applications.21

Epoxy resins, among various possible candidates
for high-performance
structural composite applications, have emerged as one of the most
important industrial engineered plastics.22 Because of their superior chemical, electrical, heat resistance,
adhesion, and mechanical properties as well as low cost, epoxy resins
are widely employed in composites, coatings, adhesives, and automotive
components.23 For epoxy-based structural
composite applications, the system generally contains an epoxy resin
and an external cross-linking agent that helps to form the cross-linked
epoxy matrix, which results in the enhanced mechanical properties
of the composite structures. The most widely used epoxy prepolymer
is diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) derived from petroleum
products, whereas the primary cross-linkers employed are amine-based
synthetic chemicals.24,25 The constant increase of oil
prices and the nonsustainable nature coupled with its intrinsic poor
impact resistance (due to the highly cross-linked structure) as well
as relatively poor resistance to crack initiation and growth are the
biggest challenges of cross-linked epoxy systems when considered for
engineering applications. Although significant efforts have been made
to developing toughened epoxy composites with and without the use
of external fillers as well as biobased epoxies, developing a product
that is viable for industrial applications is still an engineering
pursuit.9,25−34 In the direction of enhancing the sustainability, various studies
looked into the opportunity to find a sustainable replacement for
typical epoxy resin components,25 including
the incorporation of vegetable oils10,35 and natural
rubber. However, an introduction of a foreign body into the epoxy
matrix typically resulted in overall adverse effects on the thermal
and mechanical properties. In this direction, proteinaceous materials
that can simultaneously work as fillers as well as cross-linking agents
provide an alternate potentially beneficial pathway.

The rich
surface functionality of AP and the possibility to chemically
engineer their interaction with an epoxy system make them a viable
candidate for futuristic biobased structural composite applications.
Consequently, efforts were undertaken to investigate the properties
and behavior of plastics and composites derived from APs. However,
efforts to create a protein-based thermoplastic film by unmodified36 or surface-modified proteins37,38 as well as to develop feather meal protein-based biodegradable polymers39 resulted in inferior mechanical properties.
Moreover, the hydrophilic nature of the resultant polymers proved
detrimental for their processing by expediting their thermal degradation,
leading to inferior thermal properties, making it a challenge to obtain
high-performance materials. Hence, such materials are limited to low
performance and perhaps low economic value applications. More recently,
because of the exciting economic value, much interest is expressed
toward the preparation of protein-based thermoset materials. Most
of the studies targeted protein functional groups, especially amino
acid residues—primary amines, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and sulfhydryls
and their reactivity toward a particular chemical. Among these studies,
aldehydes (formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and glyoxal) are the most
commonly used agents for the chemical cross-linking of protein monomers.40−42 However, the release of toxic monomers41 from such cross-linked polymeric materials limits the use of protein-based
plastics. More recently, Mekonnen et al.43,44 employed peptide molecules from the hydrolyzed AP as cross-linkers
to construct cross-linked DGEBA thermoset resins. In addition to being
an energy-intensive and expensive process, the resultant thermosets
demonstrated poor cure kinetics and significant reduction in strength
and strain-at-break—parameters critical for structural applications.

As illustrated above, a lack of in-depth understanding about the
protein–matrix interactions and an absence of energy-efficient
chemical processing methodologies for APs inhibited the complete utilization
of the AP’s potential in polymer composite applications. In
this study, we analyze and understand various challenges regarding
the implementation of APs in epoxy-based composite applications and
devise diverse mechanisms to overcome the challenges and engineer
their properties. First, we devise an efficient process to extract
and purify rendered APs and use them individually (up to 30%) or in
combination with other additives as biobased cross-linking agents
for developing high-strength, toughened AP-intermeshed thermoset polymers.
Understanding the polarity difference between the matrix and the protein
and hence the low compatibility, we demonstrate a novel hybrid cross-linked
film containing a water-soluble epoxy resin (WEP) and AP. Leveraging
a suite of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, the compatibility,
phase separation, curing reaction kinetics, and thermal properties
were studied for each of the engineered products. Reaction kinetics
study was also performed to investigate the activation energy of the
curing process. Thus, various parameters and pathways to optimize
the mechanical properties of the AP-based epoxy cross-linked matrix
are elucidated. The fundamental understanding and various pathways
reported here to design diverse epoxy systems and to engineer their
properties are expected to catalyze the AP-based composite research
especially targeted toward high-performance applications, such as
in the automotive industry.

Results and Discussion
Investigation of Cross-Linking
Reactions of AP and Epoxy Resin
and Optimization
Although curing the epoxy system using hydrolyzed
proteins showed moderate success,43,44 the use of
a native protein as a natural cross-linking agent for epoxy is comparatively
less explored. The presence of a multitude of reactive functional
groups in purified protein, including amine (−NH2), carboxyl (−COOH), sulfhydryl (−SH), hydroxyl (−OH),
and carbonyl (−CHO) groups, should ensure the reaction between
AP and DGEBA. The plausible reactions between the functional groups
and epoxy are available in the literature.45 Among the various possibilities, the three major mechanisms of the
reaction between the AP functional groups and epoxy are depicted in
the scheme in Figure 1a. The proposed reaction of the AP-aided cross-linking of DGEBA is
illustrated in Figure 1b. Thus, at elevated temperatures, the functional groups on the AP
react with the epoxy groups in the resin to form a cross-linked network,
resulting in the proposed protein-intermeshed thermoset material (epoxy–AP).
The hybrid was investigated using different spectroscopic, microscopic,
and mechanical tests to understand the fundamentals of the epoxy–AP
interaction and the resultant properties. First, the cured sample
was analyzed using infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The IR spectra (Figure 1c) were obtained
for the system before and after the cross-linking reaction to verify
the successful cross-linking between AP and DGEBA as well as to understand
the chemical changes for the functional groups during the cross-linking
reaction. The emergence of a new feature at around 1728 cm–1 (due to the formation of an ester group through the curing reaction
between DGEBA and protein functional groups) and a concurrent decrease
in intensity of the peak at 859 cm–1 (corresponding
to the epoxy groups) indicate the curing reaction through the coupling
of epoxy groups in the resin and functional groups on the protein.
The coupling reaction results in the formation of more ester linkages
in the cured system and a reduction of epoxy groups, which are utilized
to form a cross-linked structure.

modes of reaction between
the protein and the epoxy matrix. (b) Schematic of the protein-cross-linked

the reaction heat (enthalpy) with the increasing protein weight ratio

hybrid containing 30 wt % AP by weight.

After establishing the coupling reaction between the AP and
the
epoxy, the ratio between the AP and the epoxy to get the best curing
and kinetics was investigated. Most applications which use epoxy require
the epoxy to undergo curing. It is proven that variations in the ratio
between the curing agent and the resin can lead to different mechanical
properties with very low or high amount of the cross-linking agent,
leading to dramatic deterioration in the mechanical properties.46 Hence, it is prudent to investigate the optimal
ratio of the epoxy resin and the cross-linking agent (AP) used. Differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a widely accepted technique to monitor
the heat change during curing of thermoplastics47,48 and investigate the kinetics of curing reactions for thermoset epoxy
resins.49 We employed DSC to monitor the
extent of cross-linking in the epoxy systems having different AP contents
(ranging from 5 to 50 wt %). Curing being exothermic, the heat of
reaction corresponding to curing should be positive,50,51 and hence, we calculated the total area under the exothermal peak
to understand the extent of curing. Figure 1d shows the heat of reaction obtained from
DSC for epoxy samples containing different weight ratios of AP. We
can observe that the maximum heat of reaction is for the sample containing
30 wt % protein and 70 wt % epoxy, which was fixed as the optimal
ratio between the epoxy and the AP. A typical DSC curve for the sample
with optimal composition (epoxy 70% and AP 30%) is shown in Figure 1e. An exothermal
peak centered at ∼200 °C points to the cross-linking reaction
between the resin and the AP, again confirming the AP-induced curing
of the epoxy samples at elevated temperatures.52

Dynamic Curing Studies and Curing Kinetics
To investigate
the curing kinetics of the epoxy–AP system, we conducted DSC
studies of the sample at different curing rates. Figure 2a depicts curing peaks at different
heating rates (2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C/min) for the sample with
the ideal composition (epoxy 70% and AP 30%). We can observe that
the temperature at which the highest reaction occurs (maximum of the
exothermal peak) is affected by the heating rate, which is in accordance
with the literature.53,54 As discussed earlier, curing
of epoxy systems by the hydrolyzed protein and its cure kinetics was
investigated using nonisothermal DSC measurements.43 Similarly, assuming the reaction rate to be proportional
to the recorded heat flow, the maximum temperature value of the exothermal
peak was taken as an indicator for the highest reaction rate.55 Hence, we calculated the activation energy (Ea) of the curing reaction using the Kissinger
equation method. Here, the curing reaction is assumed to be first-order,
dependent on temperature, and independent of conversion. Hence, the Ea and the pre-exponential factor (A) can be calculated using the maximum exothermic peak temperature
(TP) and heating rate (β) (obtained
from Figure 2a)56 using the following expression (eq 1) 1  where R is the universal
gas constant (8.314 J/mol). A plot between ln(β/TP2) and 1/RTP for
all heating rates demonstrates a linear regression (Figure 2b), where the slope of the
line is Ea and the y-intercept
of the line is ln(AR/Ea). From the experimental values and line fitting, we found the activation
energy Ea to be 28.27 kJ/mol, which is
much smaller compared to the curing activation energy reported with
a similar animal protein/epoxy ratio (∼70 kJ/mol).55Table 1 lists the Kissinger parameter values from our calculations.
Generally, a lower activation energy indicates a faster reaction.
Thus, we conclude that the cross-linking process with native proteins
reported in this study is more feasible compared to that with hydrolyzed
proteins reported earlier.

Engineering of Mechanical Properties
After establishing
the cross-linking of the epoxy matrix by the purified native protein,
we evaluated the mechanical properties of the cured materials. The
cured material, although showing superior performance compared to
the pure epoxy matrix, largely demonstrated inferior properties when
compared to the existing composites (ones cross-linked with hydrolyzed
proteins).43 The samples demonstrated a
brittle nature and were not suitable for structural composite applications
(Figure 4c). We infer
this inferior performance to be due to (a) a large complex molecular
structure of the protein, which makes it difficult to leverage all
functional groups in the proteins, (b) inherent brittle nature of
the proteins, and (c) the difference in polarity between the protein
and the matrix, which limits the possible interactions. Understanding
the challenges allowed us to overcome them via intelligent chemical
strategies.

For solving the complex molecular structure of APs
and their significantly reduced reaction potential, we introduced
bismaleimide (BMI), an agent with high cross-linking ability, high
thermal stability, high glass-transition temperature, superior specific
strength modulus, and excellent fire resistance.57,58Figure 3a shows the
reaction of BMI with the protein-infiltrated epoxy matrix. To bypass
the brittleness induced by the protein, we introduced hyperbranched
polymers (HBPs), which are ultrabranched polydisperse molecules at
the nanometer scale. Because of their nano size, HBPs help to constrain
matrix deformation as they interact better with the polymer microstructure
on reaching nearly molecular dimensions.59 First, we conducted studies to identify the optimal ratio of BMI
and HBP using the reaction heat calculations and mechanical property
measurements, respectively. By varying the BMI content in the epoxy
matrix and calculating the reaction heat (Figure 3b), we identified 20% BMI as the ideal content
(highest reaction heat). After optimizing the ideal BMI content in
the composite, the optimization of HBP was conducted by comparing
the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) (Figure 3c). Samples were prepared by the addition
of 5, 10, and 15 wt % of HBP to the epoxy–AP mixture, and the
tensile tests indicated that the optimal HBP is around 10% at which
the UTS is maximum. Thus, 20% BMI and 10% HBP were chosen to enhance
the properties of the epoxy–AP networks.

Figure 3 (a) Schematic illustration
of the reaction between BMI, epoxy resin,
and AP to result in increased cross-linking. (b) DSC-based optimization
of the BMI content. (c) Optimization of the HBP in the epoxy–AP–BMI
system through the measurement of mechanical performance.

The improvement of the mechanical properties obtained
by the addition
of BMI (20 wt %) and HBP (10 wt %), either individually or in combination,
is summarized in Figure 4a–c. Whereas the individual addition
of BMI and HBP demonstrated increase in the UTS of the epoxy–AP
hybrid polymer, the introduction of both HBP and BMI led to its UTS
value reaching 14 MPa, which is comparable to that of soybean protein-based
plastics.60 The addition of HBP was seen
to increase the elongation-at-break (or strain-at-break), whereas
the addition of BMI reduced its elongation-at-break (Figure 4b). This is understandable
because the addition of BMI promotes the formation of intermolecular
connections, which increases the cross-linking density and causes
a smaller strain-at-break with a higher UTS and modulus.57,58 Furthermore, the modulus of the epoxy–AP–BMI combination
was observed to be the highest among all combinations. Thus, the addition
of HBP resulted in enhancement in modulus, strength, and strain-at-break,
and the introduction of BMI led to an increase in modulus and strength
along with a decline in the strain-at-break of the epoxy–protein
thermoset matrix because of increase in the cross-linking density
and reduction in the free volume in the final polymer network.61

and epoxy–AP–BMI–HBP hybrid systems. (d) TGA
and (e) derivative TGA of the epoxy–AP hybrids with and without
BMI and/or HBP.

However, simultaneous
addition of BMI and HBP was observed to result
in complementary properties, that is, superior strength and strain-at-break.
When compared to the study using hydrolyzed polymers, the UTS obtained
here is inferior,43 but we were able to
achieve strength comparable to that of soybean protein-based plastics
using native proteins. This is a radical improvement because such
enhanced mechanics has never been achieved using native proteins with
significantly lower accessible functional groups compared to hydrolyzed
proteins. The functional group density increases effectively when
the AP is hydrolyzed to small peptides, which increases the cross-linking
density of the polymer network. However, such hydrolysis also comes
at an expense as it is an energy-intensive process because of the
employment of high pressure and high temperature. As such, although
the hydrolyzed protein leads to enhanced strength, it also leads to
an increase in the process cost, thereby leading to an increase in
the overall product cost. On the other side, the mechanical properties
show a compromise with the replacement of a traditional hardener with
AP. The investigation of a traditional epoxy–hardener system
shows the UTS, elongation-at-break, and modulus as 52 MPa, 7.9%, and
420 MPa, respectively. However, the enhanced mechanics obtained here
using the native protein through cochemical addition is more convenient
and readily adaptable.

The failure to obtain superior mechanics
even in the presence of
a cochemical that will enhance the cross-linking density and toughness
leads to the conclusion that the difference in polarity or affinity
to water could be the most influencing factor that controls the mechanical
properties of the epoxy–AP polymer systems. Epoxy matrices
are hydrophobic and are insoluble in water, whereas APs, due to the
presence of various polar functional groups, are highly hygroscopic.
Although this difference in the inherent chemical nature might not
have any influence in the case of small molecules (e.g., in the case
of hydrolyzed polymers) and at molecular level reactions, when employing
high-molecular-weight molecules such as native AP, even minute differences
in polarities could be the governing factor. Unfortunately, this aspect
was not investigated and is typically ignored. Our preliminary investigation
of the epoxy–AP system revealed clear phase separation supporting
our hypothesis. The presence of phase separation in the hybrid could
lead to the observed inferior mechanical properties. To overcome the
chemical polarity differences, we tested AP as a cross-linker for
the WEP resin systems. The expected chemical cross-linking reaction
between WEP and AP is given in the scheme (Figure 5a). Although both the amine and carboxyl
functional groups are present in AP under the present reaction condition,
the amine groups are more active than the carboxyl groups toward WEP.62 During cross-linking, the epoxy ring in WEP
opens and connects with the amine groups, along with the simultaneous
formation of new hydroxyl groups in the final product. After cross-linking,
water-based acrylic epoxy and AP formed a new thermoset network plastic
that will be referred to as “WEP–AP hybrid polymer”.
The Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectra of pure AP, WEP–AP
hybrid polymer (5 wt % AP), and pure WEP are shown in Figure 5b. Compared to the individual
component spectra, the WEP–AP hybrid polymer shows a new peak
at ∼1500 cm–1, indicating the formation of
new ester groups through a reaction between AP and WEP, proving the
cross-linking reaction. For AP, the FTIR spectra showed characteristic
peaks of amide I, which are centered at around 1634 cm–1. The addition of WEP was found to lead to shifting of this peak
to the higher wavelength of ∼1720 cm–1, indicating
strong intermolecular interactions between WEP and protein, as reported
earlier.63

reaction between WEP and

(5 wt %) hybrid polymer and the parent WEP. The inset shows the corresponding
derivative spectra.

Investigation and Comparison
of Thermal Stability
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) measurements over the temperature range of 30–600
°C were performed under a N2 atmosphere to evaluate
the thermal stability of the samples. Initial degradation temperature
(Ti) was cited as the characteristic temperature
to assess thermal stability. Here, Ti is
defined as the temperature at which 5% of the sample undergoes degradation
(Table 1). First, the
samples prepared using conventional epoxy were investigated. A comparison
of the Ti values of the four combinations
using conventional epoxy shows that addition of HBP led to reduction
in the thermal stability, whereas the addition of BMI did not lead
to any compromise on the thermal stability (Figure 4d). It is well-known that a longer polymer
chain possesses lower thermal stability than shorter polymeric chains.64 This explains the easier degradation of the
epoxy–AP–BMI–HBP combination compared to the
unmodified epoxy–AP combination. Figure 4e shows a typical derivative thermal degradation
pattern of the different epoxy–AP hybrid polymers with and
without BMI–HBP. All the maximum degradation temperatures were
close to each other for all chosen combinations and ranged from 408.9
to 420.5 °C. Two peaks (Tmax1 and Tmax2) were observed
at around 400 °C in the DTG curves for epoxy–AP–BMI
and epoxy–AP–BMI–HBP, whereas only one degradation
peak was observed in the epoxy–AP and epoxy–AP–HBP
samples. This indicates that BMI started to degrade initially at ∼385
°C, whereas the epoxy started to degrade at ∼415 °C.
However, in epoxy–AP–BMI–HBP, a third degradation
peak was observed at 483.7 °C, which can be attributed to the
presence of unreacted AP in the system. However, the broadness of
the degradation peaks for all the combinations indicates improved
cross-linking in the system. On the other hand, WEP and WEP–AP
only demonstrated one degradation temperature, indicating more compatibility
and cross-linking even in the absence of cocross-linking agents. Figure 5c shows the dependence
of weight loss on temperature upon heating the WEP and WEP–AP
hybrid films in a N2 atmosphere. The residual weight demonstrates
a concurrent decrease with an increase in temperature for both the
films. Here, we measured Ti as well as
the temperature at which 20% weight loss occurs. Both the temperatures
demonstrated reduction for the WEP–AP hybrid polymer, mainly
because of evaporation of the moisture present in the AP as described
earlier (inset of Figure 5c). Similar to the case of traditional epoxy, both the pure
WEP and hybrid polymer showed a significant weight loss above 250
°C, along with a sharp decrease in weight at 350 °C, indicating
the initiation of their decomposition. However, compared to the parent
WEP, the WEP–AP hybrid polymer has a larger residual weight,
indicating the enhanced cross-linking between the AP and the WEP system.

Figure 6a–c
shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images depicting the
morphology of the fracture surface of pure WEP, WEP–AP wt (AP—1.5
wt %), and WEP–AP wt (AP—7.5 wt %). The SEM images of
AP powder demonstrated an aggregated particle with dimensions below
200 μm, which can be attributed to the grinding process after
extraction from poultry materials. The pure WEP film was prepared
by drying a water-based acrylic epoxy water solution and showed a
porous and uneven structure. This morphology was possibly caused by
the aggregation of noncross-linked molecules. Addition of AP to the
water-based acrylic epoxy solution, followed by its subsequent curing,
led to the films showing a more even, smooth cross section. This can
be explained by the cross-linking action of AP in the final product
matrix. The AP-based cross-linking through strong covalent bonds between
AP and WEP results in a high density of interconnected molecules in
the highly cross-linked network. Thus, after curing, newly formed hybrid
thermoset films show smoother fracture surfaces than pure water-based
acrylic epoxy solution-dried films. A summary of the mechanical data
obtained from the WEP–AP hybrid polymer films is given in Figure 6d–f. We can
see a clear increase in UTS and modulus of WEP films until the AP
content reaches 5 wt %, followed by subsequent decrease (upon increase
in the AP content). This could plausibly be due to nonhomogeneous
dispersion of the AP at higher concentrations because of agglomeration
caused by increased interaction and proximity between APs. The increase
in UTS and modulus can be explained by the cross-linking of AP and
WEP. Increase in cross-linking density results in a decrease in elongation-at-break
and an increase in UTS and modulus. Pure WEP dried films showed the
lowest UTS, elongation, and modulus, which are in agreement with the
SEM images that show a highly porous structure for the WEP films,
leading to poor mechanical properties. The effect of thermal instability
of the epoxy systems is negligible and is expected to be compensated
by the enhancement of the mechanical properties obtained by cross-linking.
Moreover, through precise process engineering, this inadequacy is
supposed to be overcome to result in a bioresourced epoxy system with
excellent mechanical properties.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we devised strategies to create animal protein-based
epoxy hybrid structures with good mechanical properties using native
AP for the first time. Our study indicated that the mechanical performance
of native protein–epoxy hybrid systems can be tuned from a
high-strength structural composite to an elastic epoxy-based system
via intelligent introduction of participating hybrid components. Because
of the polarity difference between AP and epoxy, the conventional
epoxy systems need cocross-linkers to extract the complete potential
of the native AP. Although the epoxy–AP hybrids showed inferior
mechanical performance in the absence of externally added cross-linking
agents, the introduction of coagents, such as BMI and HBP, resulted
in ∼700% improved ultimate strength. Following the cure kinetics
using the reaction rate, the curing activation energy was found to
be 28.267 kJ/mol, which is much smaller than that reported in a similar
epoxy–AP system using the hydrolyzed protein. The smaller Ea value indicates that the curing reaction in
the present case is more facile compared to the cross-linking using
the hydrolyzed protein. We also identified the optimal amount of BMI
and HBP required in the hybrid polymers through following the reaction
heat and mechanical properties, respectively. While 20% of BMI helped
in enhancing the cross-linking, introduction of 10% HBP resulted in
overcoming the brittle nature of the introduced protein and resulted
in a hybrid with enhanced mechanical properties. Thermal characterization
indicated partial cross-linking in the absence of BMI and HBP and
increased cross-linking indicated by a single thermal degradation
peak. On the contrary, the WEP–AP hybrid, owing to the enhanced
affinity of AP toward the hydrophilic polymer matrices, demonstrated
high cross-linking and mechanical properties without the aid of cocross-linking
agents. Microscopic investigations revealed that the introduction
of AP to WEP results in the reduction in porosity of WEP as a direct
result of the enhanced cross-linking via the amine group of AP and
the epoxide group on the WEP. The new ester-bond formation in the
WEP–AP hybrid was confirmed through spectroscopy. This work
is the first step in the direction of leveraging underutilized protein
from the rendering industry in its native form to create biobased
hybrid polymeric systems. This is expected to attract widespread attention
and to help in developing and promoting the wider application of animal
byproducts, thereby decreasing animal waste generation as well as
promoting sustainability.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
AP—used in this study—was
a poultry byproduct meal (feed grade) provided by GRO-MOR Inc, Adams,
MA. The total protein content of the sample was >56% by dry weight.
DGEBA, NaCl, Na2HPO4, KH2PO4, and MgCl2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, WI, USA.
Hexane and BMI were purchased from VWR Chemicals, GA, USA. The filter
paper used in our study was obtained from Whatman (Whatman #4, D = 11 cm, pore size 20–25 μm). The dialysis
membrane (d = 3000) was purchased from Thermo Fisher
Scientific, MA, USA. The HBP (Boltorn H30) was purchased from Perstorp
Inc, Sweden. The water-based acrylic epoxy was purchased from Vital
Coat (Tallahassee, FL, USA). All chemicals purchased were used as
received without any further processing.

Proteinaceous Material
Extraction
Protein was extracted
from the poultry meal and salt solution mixture by controlling its
pH value. Every 100 g of the poultry meal was treated with 450 mL
of salt solution containing 18 g NaCl (or MgCl2), 4.1 g
KH2PO4, and 4.3 g Na2HPO4, according to the method used by Park et al.40 and purified through dialysis. The protein/salt solution
was filled into the dialysis membrane bag and then placed in distilled
water for 4 h, during which the water was replaced every hour. Free
α-amino group contained in the extracted protein was determined
to be 3.35 × 10–4 mol/g (see the Supporting Information).

Thermoset
Polymer Preparation
Protein samples from
the previous step were used to cross-link the DGEBA epoxy resin. The
epoxy resin was preheated to 55 °C in the oven for 30 min. The
protein was dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h at 100 °C and then
mixed with the epoxy resin by stirring at 60 °C for 2 h in varying
AP–DGEBA ratios. The prepared mixture was then cast in a silicone
mold (consistent with ASTM D-638 type V tensile geometries) and cured
at 150 °C for 5 h.

Preparation of WEP–AP Hybrid Films
AP (3 g)
and glycerol (1 g) were dissolved in distilled water (50 mL) by constant
stirring at 70 °C for 30 min. The pH of the solution was adjusted
to 10 ± 0.1 using 1 M ammonia solution. The solution was then
heated to 90 °C for 30 min to denature the AP. The resultant
protein solution was then cooled to room temperature for further use.
About 50 mL of water-based acrylic epoxy solution was heated at 60
°C until no change in weight was observed, indicating the complete
removal of water. The final solid part was then weighed, and the density
of the solution was calculated. Calculated amounts of water-based
acrylic epoxy solution and AP solution were mixed in a glass beaker,
varying the net epoxy–protein ratio as 100/0, 98.5/1.5, 95/5,
and 92.5/7.5. The mixture was thoroughly mixed by stirring on a hot
plate for 1 h at 60 °C. The mixture was then degassed in a vacuum
chamber (until no bubbles were observed) and then poured into a flat
silicone mold. The mixture was subsequently dried at room temperature
for 48 h and then dried at 60 °C for 2 h. The final membrane
was cut into 1 cm × 5 cm specimen and kept in vacuum for testing.

Characterization
Attenuated Total Reflectance–FTIR
Spectroscopy
Attenuated total reflectance (ATR)–FTIR
spectroscopy was performed
using a Thermo-Nicolet Magna 550 FTIR spectrometer in combination
with a Thermo-Spectra Tech Foundation Series Diamond ATR accessory
with the angle of incidence being 50°.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
DSC was conducted
to investigate the curing behavior of the protein–epoxy mixture
using a thermal analyzer (Q2000, TA Instruments, USA) under a N2 atmosphere. Experiments were performed with sample weights
ranging from 6 to 10 mg. In dynamic experiments, the samples were
heated from 25 to 275 °C at various heating rates (i.e., 2, 5,
10, 15, and 20 °C/min). The reaction heat was calculated based
on the total area under the exothermal peak of the DSC graph.

Thermogravimetric
Analysis
TGA measurement was performed
using a TGA Q5000 instrument (TGA Q5000) under N2 flow
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min to study the thermal degradation
behavior of the protein-based plastics. About 8 mg of the samples
was heated at 10 °C/min over the temperature range of 30–600
°C under a N2 atmosphere.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Thin films at varying
weight ratios of WEP–AP were frozen in liquid nitrogen and
broken quickly. The fractured surfaces of the films were then coated
with 60% gold and 40% palladium for 60 s at 45 mA current in a sputter
coater (Desk II, Denton Vacuum, Moorestown, NJ). Hitachi S4800 SEM,
Japan, was used to understand the miscibility and compatibility of
epoxy and AP.

Mechanical Properties
The tensile
strength and elongation-at-break
were measured using an Instron Universal Testing Machine (model 1125),
Grove City, PA, USA, at a cross-head speed of 50 mm/min, with 30 mm
grip separation. Testing was done as per the relevant ASTM standards.
