Short histidine-rich peptides could
serve as novel activatable
vectors for delivering cytotoxic payloads to tumor and neovasculature
cells. This explorative study reports preliminary results showing
that zinc ions, which are found in elevated levels at neovasculature
sites, can trigger the intracellular delivery of a short antimicrobial
peptide when conjugated to a histidine-rich peptide through a disulfide
bond. The importance of exofacial thiols in the mode of action of
these disulfide-linked conjugates is also shown.

==== Body
Introduction
The selective delivery
of cytotoxic compounds to tumors following
systemic administration is a subject that has been, and continues
to be, the focus of many research groups. Numerous innovative targeting
strategies have this far been identified, where the recurring theme
is the exploitation of cellular and biochemical differences that exist
between normal and cancer cells.1

One of these differences is the pH gradient that can be found between normal and tumor tissue.2,3 This phenomenon is due to the Warburg effect as well as the ineffective
removal of acidic metabolic byproducts from tumor tissue. Strategies
that exploit lower pH conditions typically involve the hydrolysis
of acid-labile linkers or polymers resulting in the site-specific
release of an active anticancer agent.1

A relatively new approach in the same vein is to take advantage
of the facultative cationic character of histidine-rich peptides (HRPs).
The imidazole moiety in histidine, with a pKa value of approximately 6, is predominantly neutral under
normal physiological conditions, but is readily protonated in the
acidic microenvironment of a solid tumor. Consequently, the low pH
can function as an activation trigger for a tumor-specific event.
The usefulness of this concept was illustrated in studies where HRPs
were shown to selectively lyse tumor cells in vivo(4,5) and, more recently, were used as acid-catalyzed cell-penetrating
peptides.6

Studies of the ubiquitous
and multifunctional plasma protein,7 histidine-rich
glycoprotein (HRGP), have revealed
yet another activation trigger for HRPs. It was found that fragments
of HRGP can acquire cationic charge not only by protonation but also
through metal ion chelation.8,9 The normal concentration
of Zn2+ found in plasma is too low for HRGP activation,
but it was shown that at angiogenic sites, the elevated levels (approximately
50 μM) of Zn2+ exist, which are high enough to provide
HRGP with a functional environment.10 This
localized increase of Zn2+ is mediated through activated
platelets, which have been shown to aggregate at sites of angiogenesis.10,11 Having large amounts of Zn2+ sequestered in their α-granules,12 platelets can, once activated, effectuate a
substantial increase in microenvironmental Zn2+ concentrations
through a process called degranulation.10

When activated, HRGP can subsequently bind to glycosaminoglycans13 and take part in the inhibition of angiogenesis.14−16 This observation led to short fragments of HRGP being investigated
as potential inhibitors of angiogenesis.17

We propose that short HRPs could be used as vectors for the
targeted
delivery of a cytotoxic cargoes to angiogenic sites and solid tumors
(see Figure 1). The
acquisition of charge (via protonation and/or chelation) will allow
the vector to interact electrostatically with glycosaminoglycans that
are often overexpressed on cancer cell membranes. After being immobilized
on the surface of a target cell, the cargo can then be transported
into the cell via endocytosis.

Figure 1 Multiple triggered delivery vector. Facultative
cationic histidine-rich
peptides could be activated by protonation (solid tumors) or chelation
of Zn2+ ions (angiogenic sites).

In the present study, two units of HRGP’s tandem repeat
sequence, GHHPH, are used as a vector since it was reported to chelate
Zn2+ with high affinity.18 A
short antimicrobial peptide, RWRWRW or (RW)3, was chosen
as a cargo since a similar peptide was shown to have a cytotoxic effect
after intracellular delivery.19 A disulfide
linker was used to conjugate the vector and cargo as this will result
in the release of the cargo upon reduction. Our hypotheses were tested
by screening for cytotoxic activity (MTT assay) against prostate carcinoma
cells using elevated Zn2+ levels as the trigger.

Results
and Discussion
(RW)3-amide (1) (see Figure 2A) is a short antimicrobial
peptide (SAMP)
with good activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
without causing hemolysis.20 Its inactivity
toward human red blood cells makes it an ideal candidate for systemic
administration and transport.

as IC50 values for (C) peptide 1, (D) peptide 2 in the absence or presence of Zn2+ ions, and
(E) peptide 3.

When tested against DU-145 prostate cancer cells, peptide 1 did, as expected, show no signs of cytotoxicity (Figure 2C). The next step
was to join an (RW)3-peptide cargo peptide to an HRP-delivery
vector peptide through an asymmetrical disulfide. The thiolated HRP-delivery
vector was prepared by coupling a short HRGP fragment, (GHHPH)2, with a spacer moiety (6-aminohexanoic acid, Ahx) and a cysteine
to its N-terminus. To prepare for the disulfide linkage between the
SAMP and vector, the C-terminus of (RW)3 was functionalized
with cysteamine, (peptide 3, see Figure 1A). The SAMP and HRP vector were conjugated
to yield the complete cargo-linker-vector peptide 2 (see Figure 2B). When this disulfide
conjugate peptide was tested against DU-145 cells under elevated Zn2+ (50 μM) conditions, IC50 values below 50
μM were seen (Figure 2D), seemingly confirming the concept. However, repeating the
cytotoxicity assay in the absence of Zn2+ ions yielded,
surprisingly, near identical IC50 values.

One possible
hypothesis explaining the Zn2+ independence
of peptide 2 is that the HRP-delivery vector was lost
during the assay by reduction of the disulfide and that the observed
cytotoxicity was due to the prematurely liberated thiolated cargo
peptide 3. To test this hypothesis, peptide 3 was tested separately against DU-145 cells and a cytotoxic effect
on a similar level as peptide 2 was observed (Figure 2E).

To exclude
that the observed activity was caused by the vector
component, (GHHPG)2 was tested by itself under normal or
elevated Zn2+ conditions. No activity was seen (results
not shown), hence proving that the cytotoxicity is caused by the SAMP
component alone.

As further substantiation that the (RW)3-thiol cargo
was the source of the observed cytotoxic activity, it was replaced
with an inactive peptide, (EA)3-thiol, and tested. Once
again, no activity was observed (results not shown).

The Zn2+ independence of the cytotoxicity of the complete
cargo-linker-vector peptide 2 shows that the cysteamine-cysteine
linker is not fit for purpose in a selective delivery system.

However, this result did give some insight into how peptides 2 and 3 are causing cell death. The fact that
they have similar IC50 values might suggest a common mode
of action involving cell surface thiols.

Several extracellular
membrane proteins contain thiols, most notably
protein disulfide isomerase and thioredoxins, and these are thought
to play important roles in extracellular redox control. Furthermore,
it was previously reported that these extracellular or exofacial thiols
can facilitate or enhance the ability of disulfide- and thiol-containing
peptides to translocate across cell membranes.21,22

Thus, it could be hypothesized that once peptide 3 becomes covalently attached to a membrane protein, it will subsequently
be endocytosed making it possible to interact with an internal target
(e.g., the lysosome or endoplasmic reticulum19) resulting in cell death. This hypothesis could also explain why
peptide 1 is not exhibiting cytotoxicity, that is, the
lack of a thiol group precludes transduction across the cell membrane
in a similar manner. An oxidative formation of a disulfide bond between
the cargo peptide 3 and exofacial thiols could therefore
explain the cytotoxicity observed for this peptide. For the same disulfide
formation to take place from the disulfide peptide 2,
the likely mechanism is thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. At physiological
pH, a thiol can be deprotonated to become a thiolate group. Sufficiently
nucleophilic, an exofacial thiolate can attack the disulfide bond
in peptide 2 leading to a rearrangement, which results
in a new (different) disulfide bond and thiolate group. Peptide 2 could thus become covalently attached to proteins on the
surface of the cell forming similar structures as peptide 3, thus explaining that similar cytotoxicities are observed with both
peptides 2 and 3. As can be seen from the
chemical structure of the linker (Figure 2B), the disulfide is exposed with no neighboring
groups shielding it from nucleophilic attack.

To pertinently
investigate the linker system’s stability
and thiol-disulfide exchange theory, a second conjugate peptide was
prepared. Replacing the cysteine in the HRP vector with penicillamine,
a more sterically hindered disulfide linker was obtained. This vector
has two sterically hindering methyl groups on the β-carbon adjacent
to the sulfur atom, a feature that has previously been shown to improve
the stability of disulfide linkers.23 When
this new penicillamine conjugate, 4 (Figure 3A), was tested against DU-145
cells under normal and elevated Zn2+ conditions, a clear
difference was seen (Figure 3C), where cytotoxic activity was only observed in the presence
of Zn2+. The IC50 value obtained was similar
to that of peptides 2 and 3.

Figure 3 Cytotoxicity is thiol-mediated
and caused by the SAMP cargo. (A)
The sterically hindered cysteamine-penicillamine disulfide linker
system, (B) nonreducible aminohexanoic linker, (C) cytotoxicity of
peptide 4 upon Zn2+ activation but can be
inhibited by capping exofacial thiols with DTNB, and (D) no cytotoxicity
of peptide 5 when SAMP is irreversibly linked to vector.

This result shows that employing a cargo-linker-vector
peptide
with a more stable disulfide bond requires Zn2+ activation
before providing the cytotoxic effect. It seems that stronger ionic
interaction between the peptide and cell membrane is needed before
exchange reactions between surface thiols and sterically hindered
disulfides can take place.

To further substantiate the relationship
between cytotoxic activity
and surface thiols, two additional experiments were performed. First,
cells were preincubated with 5,5-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or
DTNB, prior to treatment with the Zn2+-activated peptide 4. DTNB is a cell impermeable disulfide reagent that blocks
all accessible surface thiols. No activity was seen for peptide 4 against DTNB-pretreated cells (see Figure 3C), further substantiating the need for free
surface thiols for the cytotoxic effect.

Second, the cysteamine-penicillamine
disulfide linker was replaced
with a nonreducible linker. When this peptide, 5 (Figure 3B), was tested in
the presence of Zn2+ and absence of DTNB, no activity was
observed. This result not only confirms the role of surface thiols
but also serves as proof that the activity seen is due only to the
SAMP component and not the conjugate as a whole.

Next, the effect
of linker stability on the kinetics of thiol-disulfide
exchange reactions was investigated. Glutathione is found both in
reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms in the body. Because of the
oxidizing conditions found in plasma, concentrations of GSH are quite
low, while cytopolasmic levels tend to be much higher.24 To test the stability of the two linker systems,
both disulfide conjugates were allowed to react with GSH. Two different
concentrations were used to simulate extra- and intracellular conditions,
and the reaction was followed using ultra performance liquid chromatography
(UPLC). The stability is expressed as a linker reduction or LR50 value, that is, the time required to reduce the amount of
intact linker by 50%. The amount of intact conjugate was calculated
and is presented in Figure 4. Both conjugates had lower LR50 values for higher
GSH concentrations, and as expected, the sterically hindered cysteamine-penicillamine
system is reduced significantly slower.

Figure 4 Modulating the stability
of the linker toward thiol-disulfide exchange.
In comparison with 2, a significantly improved stability
profile is seen for the sterically hindered penicillamine linker system
of 4.

Taking the cell viability
and linker reduction results together,
it is clear that 4 has a much better activation and cargo
release profile than its labile cysteine analogue.

To better
understand the mechanism by which 4 kills
the cells, an electron microscopy study was performed. Cells were
cultured as before and treated with peptide 4 for 24
h at a concentration of 27 μM (approximately 0.75 × IC50). After the incubation period, the cells were collected,
fixed and sections were prepared for transmission electron microscopy
(TEM).

Analysis revealed a complete absence of morphology associated
with
classical apoptosis (i.e., membrane blebbing, disrupted mitochondria,
and condensed DNA). Instead, peptide treatment resulted in massive
vacuolization of the cells’ cytoplasm (Figure 5B). Cytoplasmic vacuolization is a phenomenon
often seen when cells are killed via the lysosomal membrane permeation
(LMP) pathway. During LMP, proteolytic enzymes (e.g., cathepsins)
are released in the cytoplasm following membrane permeation/disintegration,
resulting in a necrotic-like cell death. Although further experiments
need to be done to confirm this hypothesis, it is worth to note that
when a similar antimicrobial peptide (RRWQWR-amide) was transported
into the cytoplasm of leukemia cells using fusogenic liposomes, a
caspase-independent, cathepsin-mediated cell death was observed.19

Conclusions
This work has demonstrated
that short antimicrobial peptides can
be converted into anticancer compounds by simply incorporating a thiol
group into their structure. This thiol allows the antimicrobial peptides
to exert their cytotoxic properties by forming disulfide bonds with
exofacial thiols. The results presented here suggest that (i) following
extracellular thiol-disulfide exchange reactions, a thiolated SAMP
is (ii) transported across the cancer cell membrane where it (iii)
induces cell death via a mechanism that presumably involves the permeation
of lysosomal membranes. However, this mechanism will not enable a
targeted activity toward cancer cells. Selective activity on cancer
cells can, however, be directed towards cancer calls using this fundamental
property but only in combination with an appropriate targeting strategy.

This study has shown that the inherent cytotoxicity of a SAMP can
simultaneously be masked and directed toward tumor and neovasculature
cells by conjugation to a histidine-rich vector via a sterically hindered
disulfide linker system.

To fully assess the practical potential
of this concept, further
studies are required. First and foremost, it is important that spectroscopic
and modeling studies are conducted to elucidate the manner by which
the peptides interact and form complexes with Zn2+ ions.
Second, the dual activatable nature of histine-rich vectors is confirmed
by testing the conjugates against cells adapted for growth at lower
pH conditions. Also, conjugates with higher potency (i.e., lower IC50 values) will have to be designed and tested. Toward this
end, current research in our group is focusing on cytotoxic peptidomimetics
and small molecules as cargo elements.

If proven successful,
this concept could potentially be developed
into a general dual-activated delivery system for all types of thiol-containing
cargos, enabling a new method of increasing tumor specific activity
of anticancer agents, while simultaneously reducing the risk of systemic
toxicity.

Experimental Section
Peptide Synthesis
All peptides were
synthesized by
NORCE AS (Tromsø, Norway) following standard Fmoc-protocols.
Thiolated SAMPs were synthesized using a cysteamine 2-chlorotrityl
resin. Vector peptides were Npys-modified during the final TFA cleavage
step25 to yield a light straw-colored peptide.
Crude peptides were purified by preparative HPLC (to >95% purity)
and lyophilized to yield TFA salts. Purity and correct molecular mass
were confirmed by UPLC-PDA and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToF
MS), respectively.

Conjugation Reactions
Asymmetrical
disulfide peptides
were prepared by conjugating the free thiol-containing SAMP and Npys-protected
vector peptide in solution. Both components were dissolved in Milli-Q
water and mixed, and the pH was adjusted to 8. The conjugation reaction,
characterized by the development of a strong yellow color, was almost
instantaneous (slower for the cysteamine-penicillamine disulfide).
Directly after the reaction was completed, the pH was adjusted to
2 and the conjugation mixture purified using preparative HPLC.

In Vitro
Assays
DU-145 prostate carcinoma cells were
used in the biological evaluation of the peptides. The cells were
cultivated in standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2).
Afterward, cells were seeded in 96-well plates to a concentration
of 1.5 × 105 cells per well. Following a 24 h peptide
treatment, cell viability was determined using the well-established
MTT assay.

The RPMI-1640 media was used to prepare peptide dilution
series (10–500 μg/mL). To simulate elevated Zn2+ levels found at angiogenic sites, the media was adjusted with 50
μM ZnCl2.

Exofacial thiols were blocked by
preincubating cells for 1 h with
RPMI-1640 containing 2.5 mM DTNB. To ensure a thiol-free environment
during the 24 h incubation period, the peptide dilution series were
supplemented with 1 mM DTNB.

Linker Reduction Assay
The stability
of two disulfide
conjugates toward GSH was determined in a kinetic assay. The peptides
were dissolved in Milli-Q water to yield a stock solution of 1 mg/mL.
Two different conjugate:GSH ratios were tested (1:10 and 1:100). The
conjugates were diluted with 100 mM Tris (pH 7.6) to 50 μM working
solutions right before the start of the reaction. The GSH (10 mM in
100 mM Tris, pH 7.6) was added, and the reaction was followed with
UPLC. Samples were taken every 15 min, and the reaction was monitored
until all of the original disulfide conjugate disappeared. New peaks
representing reduction byproducts were identified (by MS) and quantified
(by UV).

Microscopy
DU-145 cells were treated with Zn2+ activated peptide 4 for 24 h, collected, fixed, sectioned,
and viewed using TEM.
