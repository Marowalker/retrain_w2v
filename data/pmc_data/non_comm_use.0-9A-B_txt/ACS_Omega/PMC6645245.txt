Toxicity
challenges by antifungal arsenals and emergence of multidrug
resistance scenario has posed a serious threat to global community.
To cope up with this alarming situation, phytoactive molecules are
richest, safest, and most effective source of broad spectrum antimicrobial
compounds. In the present investigation, six phytoactive molecules
[cinnamaldehyde (CIN), epigallocatechin, vanillin, eugenol (EUG),
furanone, and epigallocatechin gallate] were studied against Candida glabrata and its clinical isolates. Among
these, CIN and EUG which are active components of cinnamon and clove
essential oils, respectively, exhibited maximum inhibition against
planktonic growth of C. glabrata at
a concentration of 64 and 128 μg mL–1, respectively.
These two molecules effectively inhibited and eradicated approximately
80% biofilm of C. glabrata and its
clinical isolates from biomaterials. CIN and EUG increased reactive
oxygen species generation, cell lysis, and ergosterol content in plasma
membrane and reduced virulence attributes (phospholipase and proteinase)
as well as catalase activity of C. glabrata cells. Reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential with increased
release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol
indicated initiation of early apoptosis in CIN- and EUG-treated C. glabrata cells. Transcriptional analysis showed
that multidrug transporter (CDR1) and ergosterol
biosynthesis genes were downregulated in the presence of CIN, while
getting upregulated in EUG-treated cells. Interestingly, genes such
as 1,3-β-glucan synthase (FKS1), GPI-anchored
protein (KRE1), and sterol importer (AUS1) were downregulated upon treatment of CIN/EUG. These results provided
molecular-level insights about the antifungal mechanism of CIN and
EUG against C. glabrata including its
resistant clinical isolate. The current data established that CIN
and EUG can be potentially formulated in new antifungal strategies.

Introduction
Mortality and morbidity
incidences of infections caused by Candida have increased in the last few decades. This
escalating rate of infection depends upon a number of factors including
age of the patient, antibiotic therapy, and immune state of patients.1,2 In catheter-associated urinary tract infection, Candida is ranked second, whereas third is the blood-stream infections caused
in intensive care unit.3−5 Among Candida species, Candida albicans is the major etiological agent of
invasive candidiasis in hospitalized patients. However, non-albicansCandida (NAC) species
such as Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis have emerged as a leading cause of systemic candidiasis because
of the arbitrary use of antibiotics and increased implanted devices.6 In Australia, the incidence rate of C. glabrata-associated candidemia rose from 16 to
26.7% between 2004 and 2015.7 The distribution
of Candida species has changed in last
decade resulting in an increase in proportion of C.
glabrata in the U.S., Australia, and Europe, whereas C. parapsilosis in Latin America and Africa along
with C. albicans.8 In India, a total of 70 Candida isolates were collected in which C. albicans was present in 34 samples, whereas in 36 samples, predominant NAC
spp. namely C. tropicalis, Candida haemulonii, C. glabrata, and Candida pelliculosa were found.9 Similar reports related to incidences of candidiasis
and dominance of NAC spp.-related infections are available from different
parts of India, indicating the severity of fungal infections and their
distribution.10−12 Among NAC species, C. glabrata is highly infectious in immunocompromised, diabetic, and hematologic
malignant patients.13−17 It is also the major causative agent of vulvo vaginal candidiasis
and candiduria.18

The recurrent infections
caused by Candida spp. are difficult
to treat because of their ability to form biofilm,
a three-dimensional, complex architecture of surface-adhered cells
encased into extracellular matrix (ECM) where microbes afford protected
environment.19 Cell surface hydrophobicity
has an important role in cell adherence to substratum and is mediated
by cell-surface-attached hydrophobic proteins.20 Biofilm ECM is composed of exopolymeric substances in which
the ratio of all macromolecules varies with the environment.21 ECM acts as a barrier to toxic substances and
drugs, protects cell from phagocytic cells, and maintains nutrients.22 Also, it offer structural scaffold for cell
adherence to different surfaces.23 Extracellular
DNA (eDNA) is also one of the important components of ECM and provides
structural integrity.24 The presence of
hydrolytic enzymes (proteinase and phospholipase) in ECM facilitates
tissue penetration and invasion.25 Therefore,
all of these characteristic features and components turn biofilm as
a source of recalcitrant infections which are undoubtedly difficult
to eradicate and hence liable for clinical repercussions.26

Sterol is an important component of eukaryotic
cell membrane which
is crucial for the structure maintenance and functioning of the cell.
Ergosterol is a principal fungal sterol and a well-established target
for three major classes of antifungals: azoles, polyenes, and echinocandin.27,28 Any defect in ergosterol biosynthesis or drop in ergosterol content
in Candida results in upregulation
of ERG genes, AUS1, TIR3 (sterol influx transporter), SUT1, and UPC2 (sterol metabolism regulator).29C. glabrata is inherently resistant
to azoles but a partial loss-of-function mutation in MSH2 (DNA mismatch repair gene) is responsible for its unusual high resistance
to azoles in clinical isolates.2 Further,
recent surveillance data have revealed the development of echinocandin
resistance in C. glabrata because of
mutations in hotspot regions of the genes FKS1 and FKS2.30 Echinocandin is the latest
class of antifungal which was introduced 15 years back and till date
a long pause in the discovery of clinically active antifungal reveals
the hurdles associated with drug development for eukaryotic pathogens.31

Phytoactive molecules have emerged as
a promising antibiofilm candidate
which acts by inhibiting synthesis/degrading the signal molecule or
blocking the binding site on receptor thereby, inhibiting the signal
transduction cascade events.32−34 Occurrence of phytoactive molecules
has been reported in a variety of secondary metabolites (flavanoids
and catechins) and essential oils (EOs).35−37 EOs are plant-derived
concentrated hydrophobic volatile liquids which serve as potential
candidates for treating superficial infections.38 They are well-documented antifungal agents and offer an
advantage of being used in synergy with conventional antimycotics,
even at a lower dose.35,39,40 Earlier, reports on antifungal activity of phytoactive molecules
have indicated their curative effect against C. albicans.41 However, the role of phytoactive molecules
on C. glabrata is still to be deciphered
as it is different from C. albicans in terms of virulence, ploidy, size, phenotypic switching, and antifungal
susceptibility.42

The present scenario
of antifungal resistance against conventional
therapies demands the need for more effective remedy against C. glabrata infections. The naturally occurring bioactive
molecules stand out as potential therapeutic candidates against oral
and superficial infections.43 This study
aimed to highlight the antifungal activity of six different phytoactive
molecules, namely eugenol (EUG), epigallocatechin gallate, cinnamaldehyde
(CIN), vanillin, furanone, and epigallocatechin (Figure 1), for their biofilm eradication
potency and their effect on transcriptional expression, biofilm matrix,
and cell wall components against C. glabrata and its clinical isolates. Of the selected phytoactive molecules,
CIN and EUG are active components of EOs of cinnamon and clove, respectively,
whereas catechins (epigallocatechin gallate and epigallocatechin)
are derived from green tea. The phenolic compound vanillin is present
in the vanilla pod extract, and furanone presence has been reported
in red algae (Delisea pulchra).

Results
Biofilm Formation Ability
of C. glabrata and Its Clinical Isolates
The biofilm-forming ability of C. glabrata and its clinical isolates were compared
at different time intervals (0–72 h) formed on 96-well microtiter
plates (MTPs) and quantified using a 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfo-phenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) reduction assay (Figure 2). Data showed no
significant difference in surface adherence by C. glabrata and its clinical isolates on MTP, initially. However, results at
24 h biofilm of the clinical isolates CCG1, CCG3, and CCG4 were significantly
higher (20, 33, and 30%, respectively; P < 0.05)
to that of the control. Once the mature biofilm was formed after 48
h, again no considerable difference in the optical density (OD) values
at 492 nm was recorded by XTT reduction assay (Figure 2).

nm is plotted with different time interval (*P <
0.05).

Fungicidal Activity of
Phytoactive Molecules
Planktonic
growth inhibition of C. glabrata was
recorded using six different phytoactive molecules (CIN, EUG, epigallocatechin
gallate, vanillin, epigallacatechin, and furanone), as shown in Table 1. Among these, CIN
and EUG having an MIC90 value of 64 and 128 μg mL–1, respectively, were selected. These selected molecules
were then tested against the growth of C. glabrata and its clinical isolates by performing a spotting assay. Data depicted
fungicidal concentration of CIN and EUG to be 256 and 512 μg
mL–1, respectively, except CCG3 (Figure 3). Minimum fungicidal concentration
(MFC) value of CIN was 512 μg mL–1, whereas
that of EUG was 1024 μg mL–1 for CCG3, suggesting
this clinical isolate to be the most resistant strain among the chosen
isolates (Figure 3).

Inhibitory and Eradication
Potency of CIN and EUG
The
biofilm inhibitory and eradication potency of CIN and EUG were checked
against C. glabrata and its clinical
isolates (Figures S1 and S2; Table 2). The results were expressed as biofilm inhibitory concentration
(BIC80) and biofilm eradication concentration (BEC80). The inhibition of C. glabrata and its clinical isolate biofilm were gradual with increasing concentration
of CIN from 0 to 512 μg mL–1. Enhanced percent
inhibition of biofilm was recorded in EUG when the concentration was
raised from 32 to 512 μg mL–1 (Figure S1). The BIC80 value of CIN
for C. glabrata and its clinical isolate
(except CCG3) was 64 μg mL–1, whereas it was
128 μg mL–1 for CCG3, suggesting that clinical
isolate CCG3 to be more surface adhering and less susceptible to CIN
and EUG (Table 2).
EUG also exhibited similar inhibition pattern; BIC80 value
of CCG3 (256 μg mL–1) was twice the BIC80 value for all strains (128 μg mL–1). The biofilm susceptibility of C. glabrata and its clinical isolates toward CIN were higher (2× times)
than that of EUG (Table 2).

Table 2 BEC80 and BIC80 of CIN and EUG
Against C. glabrata and Its Isolates
 	CIN (μg mL–1)	EUG (μg mL–1)	
strain	BIC80	BEC80	BIC80	BEC80

CCG1	64	64	128	512	
CCG2	64	64	128	256	
CCG3	128	128	256	512	
CCG4	64	128	128	256	
Efficacy of CIN and EUG in
eradicating C. glabrata and its clinical
isolate biofilm was examined in 96-well MTPs using
XTT reduction assay (Table 2; Figure S2). The BEC80 value of CIN for all strains was 128 μg mL–1 except CCG1 and CCG2 for which it was twofold lower (64 μg
mL–1), as shown in Table 2. The BEC80 value of CIN for CCG1,
CCG2, and CCG3 were similar to their respective BIC80,
whereas that of C. glabrata and CCG4,
it was twofold higher than their BIC80, indicating less
susceptibility of their mature biofilm. The BEC80 value
of EUG for C. glabrata, CCG1, and CCG3
was 512 μg mL–1, whereas it was 256 μg
mL–1 for CCG2 and CCG4, indicating sensitivity of
mature biofilm of CCG2 and CCG4 toward EUG (Table 2; Figure S2).

The biofilm inhibitory effect of CIN and EUG can be correlated
with the results of surface hydrophobicity index (HI) of CIN- and
EUG-treated C. glabrata and CCG3 which
was measured by a two-phase system. The HI value showed that CCG3
(90%) was significantly more hydrophobic than C. glabrata (71%). The hydrophobicity of CIN (68.4%)- and EUG (65.34%)-treated C. glabrata decreased as compared to control. Whereas
the HI value of CCG3 treated with CIN (35.0%) decreased but remain
unchanged when exposed to EUG (84.3%) (Figure S3).

Effect of CIN and EUG on C.
glabrata Extracellular Matrix
The effect
of CIN and EUG treatment
on biochemical composition of C. glabrata extracellular matrix (ECM) was studied and compared with that of
CCG3. The carbohydrate content of ECM in control, C.
glabrata, and CCG3 control were almost similar. An
increase in the carbohydrate content of ECM was observed in both C. glabrata (30%) and CCG3 (26%) upon CIN exposure,
as compared to their respective control (Figure 4A). However, no change in carbohydrate content
was noticed upon EUG treatment. Indeed, no change was observed in
the protein content and eDNA content of CIN- and EUG-treated C. glabrata and CCG3 ECM (Figure 4B,C).

μg mL–1) and EUG (256 μg mL–1) after 48 h. Data represent means ± SDs of three independent
experiments (**P < 0.01 and *P < 0.05).

The enzymatic activity
of C. glabrata ECM treated with CIN
and EUG was also studied. Proteinase activity
was found to be higher in CCG3 as compared to C. glabrata. However, in the presence of CIN and EUG, the proteinase activity
decreased in both C. glabrata and CCG3
(Figure 4D). Likewise,
the phospholipase activity of CIN- and EUG-treated C. glabrata and CCG3 ECM was reduced (Figure 4E). The catalase activity of
untreated C. glabrata and CCG3 was
same, whereas in the presence of CIN and EUG, the activity increased
2- and 1.8-fold, respectively, for both C. glabrata and CCG3 (Figure 4F).

Above observations suggested that biochemical composition
and enzymatic
activity of C. glabrata and CCG3 ECM
were affected by CIN and EUG in a similar manner. As expected, in
CCG3 control samples, the hydrolytic enzyme activity (phospholipase
and proteinase) was more as compared to C. glabrata control cells. However, no noticeable change was observed in catalase
activity between control and CCG3.

Assessment of Morphological
Changes in C. glabrata Biofilm
Morphological analysis of C. glabrata and CCG3 biofilm samples at BEC80 value of CIN and EUG
was performed on polystyrene disc (1 cm2) for 48 h using
field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The biofilm of
untreated C. glabrata and CCG3 retained
their structural integrity as healthy yeast cells (Figure 5A,B). CCG3 exhibited substantial
cell-rupturing features as compared to C. glabrata upon treatment of CIN. CCG3 cells depicted sunken and shrunk cellular
features and are separated from outer cell wall (Figure 5C,D). However, EUG treatment
on both C. glabrata and CCG3 biofilm
depicted pore formation with wrinkled topology (Figure 5E,F).

Figure 5 FESEM images of 48 h mature C. glabrata (A) and CCG-3 biofilm (D); after 24 h
of treatment with 128 μg
mL–1 CIN (B,E); and 256 μg mL–1 EUG (C,F). The scale bar of magnification is 10 μm/1 μm.

To assess the cellular damage
caused by CIN and EUG to C. glabrata biofilm cells, fluorescence microscopy
was performed to visualize live–dead cells by FDA–PI.
All metabolically active cells emit diffusely distributed green fluorescence,
whereas those with damaged membrane showed red fluorescence. In FDA–PI
stained biofilm, control emitted only green fluorescence which indicated
live cells, whereas CIN- and EUG-treated C. glabrata and CCG3 biofilm emitted red–green fluorescence (Figure 6A).

material release in C. glabrata and
CCG3 cells treated with (B) CIN (128 μg mL–1) and (C) EUG (256 μg mL–1).

To further co-relate the observations of fluorescence
microscopy,
the effect of CIN and EUG on cell membrane was determined in terms
of rate and amount of released nucleic acid from C.
glabrata and CCG3 cells (Figure 6B,C). Both CIN and EUG caused approximately
90% nucleic acid release in C. glabrata and CCG3 after 4 h of incubation. Hundred percent cell lysis was
observed after 8 h of incubation of cells with CIN and EUG. Hence,
the cell lytic effect of CIN and EUG on C. glabrata and CCG3 can be interpreted.

Reactive Oxygen Species
Generated When Cells Exposed to CIN
and EUG
Two fluorogenic dyes, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (DCFDA) and PI, were used for reactive oxygen species (ROS)
study; DCFDA measure ROS level inside the cell, whereas PI showed
cell lysis by binding the DNA. Increased level of intracellular ROS
accumulation was recorded in the presence of EUG but not in CIN-treated C. glabrata, whereas the level of ROS accumulation
was increased in CCG3 cells upon both, CIN and EUG exposure (Figure 7A). The damaging
effect of ROS accumulation on cells was demonstrated in terms of the
binding ability of PI to DNA of the lysed cells, and the fluorescence
intensity of bounded PI was found to be higher in CIN-exposed cells
(Figure 7B). Fluorescence
microscopy images of CIN/EUG treated and untreated cells depict red
and green fluorescence indicating dead and live cells, respectively
(Figure 7C,D).

Cytochrome c Release into Cytosol and Mitochondrial
Membrane Potential
Cytochrome c content
was measured in mitochondria and cytosol of CIN and EUG treated C. glabrata and CCG3 because it gives an indirect
evidence of apoptosis. In C. glabrata cells, cyt c release was increased from 25 to 145
and 38 to 108% in the presence of CIN and EUG, respectively, from
mitochondria to cytosol (Figure 8A). Similarly, in CIN- and EUG-treated CCG3 cells,
cyt c was released from 14 to 140 and 38 to 133%,
respectively (Figure 8B).

μg mL–1) treatment in (A) C.

of C. glabrata and CCG3 cells stained
with rhodamine B to study the effect of CIN (128 μg mL–1) and EUG (256 μg mL–1) on MMP. Images were
taken at 60× magnification. The scale bar represents 10 μm.

The change in MMP of CIN (128
μg mL–1)
and EUG (256 μg mL–1) treated log phase C. glabrata, and CCG3 cells was analyzed by fluorescent
cationic rhodamine B dye using a fluorescent microscope. The effect
of CIN and EUG treatment on ATP production in C. glabrata cells was determined indirectly by measuring MMP using rhodamine
B (Figure 8C). Rhodamine
B, a hexyl ester, emits red fluorescence which in response to transmembrane
potential distributes itself across biological membrane. CIN and EUG
treatment increased the MMP, making the membrane more negatively charged
which resulted in more accumulation of rhodamine B as compared to
untreated control C. glabrata and CCG3.
Collectively, cyt c quantification and MMP data depict
the role of CIN and EUG in mediating early apoptosis.

CIN and EUG
Differentially Modulate Transcriptional Expression
The ergosterol
content in plasma membrane of CIN-and EUG-treated C.
glabrata and CCG3 was quantified spectrophotometrically.
No noticeable change in the ergosterol content was observed on CIN-treated C. glabrata cells. A significant increase in the
ergosterol content was observed upon EUG treatment in both C. glabrata and its clinical isolate CCG3 (Figure 9). Furthermore, the
enhancement of ergosterol in CCG3 is higher to that of the reference
strain.

Figure 9 Ergosterol content as percent wet weight of C. glabrata and CCG3 in CIN (32 μg mL–1) and EUG (64
μg mL–1) untreated and treated cells (**P < 0.01 and *P < 0.05).

To gain insights into the mechanism of action of
CIN and EUG against C. glabrata and
CCG3 growth, transcriptional analysis
of ergosterol synthesis genes (ERG2, ERG3, ERG4, ERG10, and ERG11), sterol importer (AUS1), GPI-anchored cell wall
protein (KRE1), 1,3-β-glucan synthase (FKS1), and multidrug transporter (CDR1)
genes were investigated by qRT-PCR, as summarized in Table S1. Expression levels of AUS1, KRE1, and FKS1 were significantly downregulated
upon treatment of both CIN/EUG. However, the expression levels of
ergosterol synthesis genes showed differential behavior upon treatment
of CIN/EUG. Upon CIN treatment, ERG2, ERG4, and ERG11 were moderately downregulated, whereas ERG10 was moderately upregulated. In case the of EUG upregulation
of ERG2, ERG3, ERG10, and ERG11, CDR1 was observed
(Table 3).

Biofilm Eradication from Clinically Relevant
Biomaterials
To investigate the biofilm eradication of C. glabrata and CCG3 by CIN and EUG formed on the
surface of clinically relevant
biomaterials (silicone urinary catheter and contact eye lens), XTT
reduction assay was performed. The absorbance values of XTT reduction
assay at 492 nm indicated that the clinical isolate CCG3 formed three
times more biofilm as compared to C. glabrata on urinary catheters indicating thereby that the CCG3 strain was
more pathogenic/virulent because of its stronger adhering properties
on biomaterial devices (Figure 10). Both CIN and EUG showed eradication of C. glabrata and CCG3 biofilm from the urinary catheter
(Figure 10A,B). CIN
at a concentration of 256 μg mL–1 eradicated
∼55% of C. glabrata biofilm
from the urinary catheter, whereas EUG showed ∼23% eradication
of C. glabrata biofilm at 512 μg
mL–1 (Table S2). However,
CIN has eradicated more than 75% of CCG3 biofilm at a concentration
of 256 μg mL–1, whereas EUG eradicated 64%
CCG3 biofilm from the urinary catheter (Table S2). This suggests that CIN and EUG to be a potent antifungal
against clinical isolate CCG3 biofilm. The differences in the eradication
of CIN and EUG between C. glabrata and
CCG3 can be attributed to their differential adherence properties
on silicone urinary catheters.

Figure 10 Quantification of C. glabrata and
CCG3 biofilm developed on urinary catheter (A,B) and contact eye lens
(C,D) after treatment at different concentrations of CIN (A,C) and
EUG (B,D).

C. glabrata and CCG3 formed almost
similar amount of biofilm on contact eye lens with OD values 0.86
(CG) and 0.67 (CCG3), suggesting the contact lens to be good surface-adhering
biomaterial. CIN and EUG have eradicated a biofilm of C. glabrata and CCG3 to a significant extent from
the contact eye lens (Figure 10C,D). CIN (256 μg mL–1) and EUG (512
μg mL–1) showed a maximum eradication of C. glabrata biofilm from the eye lens (86.6 ±
2.5 and 83.7 ± 2.8%) at their highest concentrations (Figure 10C,D; Table S2).

Discussion
Candida is an opportunistic commensal
fungal pathogen known to cause superficial to systemic infections.
The aptitude of these pathogens to form biofilm is a prime virulence
trait responsible for their multidrug resistance which often leads
to failure of therapeutic strategies.44 Biofilm is a structured community of harmonically communicating
sessile cells encapsulated in ECM.34 Disintegration
of this irreversible structure is a powerful target for therapeutic
intervention. Screening of traditional medicine which can reduce biofilm
is a promising approach in modern era.45 The antimicrobial activity and molecular target of CIN in combination
with citral has been elucidated against Penicillium
expansum growth.46 Besides
this, many researchers have highlighted the potential of phytoactive
molecules against bacterial and fungal species.47−49

In this
investigation, the antifungal activity of two effective
phytoactive molecules (CIN and EUG) was studied against two different
growth forms (planktonic and sessile) of C. glabrata and its clinical isolates. The effect of CIN and EUG on C. glabrata cell wall, ROS generation, ECM, transcription
of selected genes, and hydrophobicity was also explored and compared
with that of CCG3. The results indicated C. glabrata biofilm eradicating potency of CIN and EUG from clinically relevant
biomaterials (contact eye lens and urinary catheter). Data suggested
that clinical isolate (CCG3) is more resistant, more surface adhering,
and hydrophobic, as compared to C. glabrata, although no significant changes were observed in their ECM biochemical
compositions. Similar variation in biofilm-forming ability of clinical
isolates as compared to Candida laboratory
strain has been reported by other researchers.50,51 The plausible mechanisms observed for such a variation is the ability
of pathogens to modulate their biochemical composition/differential
adherence/hydrophobicity ability, which is the resultant of exposure
to antifungal agents, close contact with host, and timely mutations.20,25,51

Molecular Insights into C. glabrata Biofilm Eradication Mechanism by CIN
and EUG
The antimicrobial
property of natural compounds or molecules depends on the functional
group present in them.52 CIN is a naturally
occurring organic compound in cinnamon oil, whereas EUG is a phenylpropanoid
present in aromatic plants and a major component of clove oil.53,54 The antimicrobial activity of both compounds is due to their lipophilic
nature they interact with hydrophobic components (ergosterol) of cell
membrane to generate pores. This eventually reduces cell membrane
integrity and permeability, thus resulting in cell lysis and leakage
of intracellular contents (nucleic acid, protein, and ATP) from the
cell.46,53,55−59 CIN exposure might mediate damage to C. glabrata cell membrane in a similar way, as evident from results which depicts
increased release of nucleic acid followed by cell death, without
any change in ergosterol content (Figures 6 and 9). EUG also
causes cell death as well as release of nucleic acid (Figure 6); and unlike CIN, EUG increased
the cell membrane ergosterol content (Figure 9), indicating that EUG and CIN interacts
differently with cell membrane ergosterol.

Previously, researchers
have reported strong inhibitory effect of CIN on plasma membrane ATPase
which has a potential role in the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes.60 However, upsurge of this ATPase-dependent transportation
of hydrolytic enzymes enhances secreted aspartyl proteases activity
in C. albicans.61 Therefore, the observed decrease in the proteinase and
phospholipase activity in this study can be attributed to the de-escalation
of CIN/EUG-mediated ATPase, which decreased the efflux of hydrolytic
enzymes across cell membrane and ultimately results in less enzymatic
activity (Figure 4D,E).
In line with our observations, CIN reduced the proteinase and phospholipase
activities in C. albicans.62

Many studies have also proposed that the
antifungal activity of
CIN is due to its inhibitory effect on cell wall and membrane synthesizing
enzymes, mainly 1,3-β-glucan, chitin, and ergosterol.63−66 It is worth noting that cells cannot overcome the stress of ergosterol
deficiency and were more susceptible to stress conditions as ergosterol
is a crucial ingredient of fungal cell membrane in terms of membrane
rigidity, fluidity, and permeability.29,67 CIN induced
moderate transcriptional downregulation of ERG2, ERG3, ERG4, and ERG11 and
was in congruence with the data of ergosterol content which showed
no significant changes although the ergosterol importer gene AUS1 was significantly downregulated (Figure 9, Table 3). However, RT-PCR results of EUG-treated C. glabrata showed upregulation of ERG genes and an increase in ergosterol content. These results are in
sharp contrast with the previous findings because of a drop in ergosterol
content in C. albicans at fungicidal
concentrations of EUG.68 Moreover, in Trichophyton rubrum, also EUG did affect ergosterol
content.69 The differences in the ergosterol
content observed in the present case with respect to other studies
can be attributed to: (a) the differential composition of cell membrane
of C. glabrata to that of C. albicans and T. rubrum and (b) difference in EUG concentrations because this study used
subinhibitory concentration (64 μg mL–1).

CIN is also a known noncompetitive inhibitor of 1,3-β-glucan
synthase and mixed inhibitor of chitin synthase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and thus acts as cell-wall-active
antifungal molecule.63,69 Interestingly, a significant
decrease in the expression of FKS1 (1,3-β-glucan
synthase) and KRE1 (cell wall biogenesis) was observed
in CIN/EUG-treated cells. These data are in support of previous observations
suggesting the importance of using CIN and EUG as antifungal molecule
against C. glabrata.

In addition
to cell wall and membrane, CIN is also responsible
for oxidative stress generation and apoptosis.70 CIN increases the MMP that leads to ROS generation and
release of cyt c from mitochondria to cytoplasm.70 In C. albicans, CIN induces apoptosis via metacaspase-dependent pathway activated
by cytochrome c release and ROS generation. Increased
MMP is an early event of apoptosis, whereas ROS and cytochrome c are known to activate the proapoptotic pathway.71 Similarly, EUG is also known to induce oxidative
stress which causes lipid peroxidation of cytoplasmic membrane lipids
and finally cell death.72 Earlier researchers
mentioned that EUG induces apoptosis in C. albicans as a consequence of the inhibition of cell cycle progression at
G1–S and G2–M phases.73 ROS,
MMP, and cytochrome c results of CIN/EUG-exposed C. glabrata cells were in agreement with the prior
indications of CIN/EUG-induced apoptosis. The activity of catalase
enzyme, which is known to protect cell from ROS, was found to be reduced
in CIN/EUG-treated C. glabrata biofilm
cells which is in resemblance with the increased catalase activity
in CIN-exposed C. albicans.46 Considering these evidence, the mechanism of
action through which CIN and EUG exhibit antifungal activity can be
highlighted by the following cellular features (Figure 11). They include: (a) inhibition
of plasma membrane ATPase which has a role in secretion of hydrolytic
enzyme, (b) ROS generation and apoptosis, (c) damaging cell structure
by binding and removing membrane ergosterol, (d) disturbing functionality
of genes involved in membrane biosynthesis such as ERG genes, FKS1 and KRE1, and (e)
inhibiting membrane ATP binding cassette (ABC) sterol importer and
drug transporter.

Figure 11 Schematic diagram representing possible antifungal mechanism
(a–e)
of CIN and EUG in C. glabrata. (a)
By inhibition of membrane ATPase pump which mediates secretion of
hydrolytic enzyme or by degradation of hydrolytic enzymes; (b) by
ROS generation which results in release of cyt c and
activates proapoptotic pathways; (c) by disturbing cell membrane integrity
via removal of membrane ergosterol; (d) by inhibiting/altering the
functionality of biosynthetic pathway enzymes similar to ergosterol;
and (e) by blocking import of extracellular sterol or downregulating
the expression of ABC sterol importer and drug transporter.

Concluding Remarks
The current study highlights the antibiofilm activity of phytoactive
molecules (CIN and EUG) in C. glabrata and its clinical isolates. These two compounds are mediating the
antifungal activity via deactivating its hydrolytic enzymes, ROS generation,
apoptosis, and selectively modulating the ergosterol content. The
study established that these compounds are highly effective in their
biofilm eradication properties even on clinically relevant biomaterials
such as urinary catheter and eye lens. The benefit of using phytoactive
molecules in antifungal therapy is that no new formulation development
is needed for their therapeutic application as they are naturally
present in EOs. A recent study reported that EO components, such as
CIN, EUG, thymol, and carvacrol, exhibited excellent antimicrobial
activity against bacterial biofilms and shown better cytotoxicity
values against fibroblasts, macrophages, and keratinocytes cell lines
compared to the traditional antiseptic drug chlorhexidine.74 Moreover, these EOs are kept under GRAS category
by FDA (U.S.).75 Indeed, CIN is an active
component of cinnamon oil, which has passed clinical trial phase 1
for treatment of oral candidiasis.76 Furthermore,
EUG containing clove oil has also been widely used in dentistry for
treating dental caries and periodontal diseases.77,78 The study demonstrates that coating of medical implant devices with
CIN and EUG will help in preventing implant-associated fungal infections.
With these perspectives, we believe that naturally occurring phytoactive
molecules stand out as a potential source of bioactive molecule with
immense therapeutic applications in treating dental, oral, and superficial
fungal infections.

Materials and Methods
Strain Collection and Culturing
of C. glabrata and Its Clinical Isolates
C. glabrata (CG; MTCC 3019) used
in the study was procured from IMTECH (Microbial
Type Culture Collection), Chandigarh, India. C. glabrata clinical isolates (CCG1, CCG2, CCG3, and CCG4) used in this study
were a kind gift from Dr. Navin Kumar, Graphic Era Deemed to be University,
Dehradun, India.79 Clinical isolates of C. glabrata were classified as susceptible (CCG4),
susceptible dose-dependent (CCG2), and resistant (CCG1 and CCG3) according
to interpretive guidelines for in vitro susceptibility testing of Candida species for fluconazole.79 All strains were routinely maintained and cultured in YPD
media (1% yeast extract, 2% dextrose, and 2% peptone; 2% agar for
solid media) at 37 °C. The urinary catheter and eye lens (EtafilconA;
14.0 DIA) were purchased locally. All chemicals used in the study
were procured from Sigma-Aldrich chemicals Ltd and Himedia, India.
RNeasy kit and RT-PCR reagents were purchased from QIAGEN and Applied
Biosystems, respectively. Stock solutions of CIN and EUG were prepared
in dimethyl sulfoxide.

Biofilm Formation Studies on C. glabrata and Its Clinical Isolates
Biofilm
forming ability of C. glabrata and
its clinical isolates were studied
in 96-well flat bottom MTPs in RPMI medium (Roswell Park Memorial
Institute). Log-phase cultures of all strains were diluted individually
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.0) to a concentration of
1 × 107 cells mL–1. The suspension
(100 μL) of these cells was separately added to wells of MTP
and incubated for 90 min. After incubation, PBS was replaced with
RPMI, and MTP was again incubated at 37 °C. For quantification
of biofilm formed at different time intervals (2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 24,
and 48 h), XTT reduction assay was used.80

For studying the effect of CIN and EUG on C.
glabrata and its clinical isolate biofilm, log phase
cells were diluted in sterile PBS to a concentration of 1 × 107 cells mL–1, and 100 μL of suspension
was added into each well of MTP.81 Plates
were then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min (adhesion phase), and
200 μL of RPMI containing CIN and EUG in the concentration range
of 512–2 μg mL–1 was added after washing
wells thrice with PBS. The plates were again incubated for 48 h, and
the inhibitory effect of CIN and EUG was evaluated in terms of metabolic
activity by XTT reduction assay.

For mature biofilm, after 90
min incubation of adhesion phase,
wells were washed with PBS and 200 μL of RPMI was added. Then,
plates were reincubated for 48 h followed by washing with PBS, and
200 μL of RPMI containing CIN and EUG in the concentration range
of 512–2 μg mL–1 was added. The eradicating
effect of CIN and EUG on biofilm was evaluated by XTT reduction assay
after 24 h of incubation.

Minimum Inhibitory Concentration Measurements
The inhibitory
effect of six different phytoactive molecules was initially screened
against C. glabrata in MTP as per M27-A2
guidelines for yeast broth microdilution.82 The concentration of log phase C. glabrata cells was adjusted to 2.5 × 103 cells mL–1 in RPMI medium. Briefly, 100 μL of cell suspension was added
into each well of MTP and 100 μL of twofold diluted phytoactive
molecule in RPMI media (range 1024–32 μg mL–1) was also added. The plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C
and visualized for growth in the form of turbidity. The results are
represented as MIC90 values; a concentration where 90%
growth was inhibited as compared to control.

MFC Measurements
MFC of phytoactive molecules was determined
against C. glabrata and its clinical
isolates on YPD agar media plates. The 48 h-treated cells from MTP
of MIC were spotted on to solid media plates. The drop was then air
dried and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. After incubation, plates
were photographed on a black background.79

Determination of Ergosterol Content
Ergosterol content in the
cell membrane of C. glabrata and CCG3
cells was measured by incubating log phase cells in sabouraud dextrose
broth with or without CIN (32 μg mL–1) and
EUG (64 μg mL–1) for 24 h at 37 °C.69 The cells were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5
min, and the pellet was washed with sterile water. The wet weight
of the cell pellet was measured, and the pellet was suspended in 3
mL of lysing agent (25% alcoholic KOH) and vortexed for 1 min. Cell
suspension was incubated for 1 h at 85 °C in water bath. Then,
sterols were extracted by adding a mixture of distilled water and n-heptane in a 1:3 ratio, followed by vigorous vortexing.
The heptane layer was collected carefully in glass tubes and stored
for 24 h at −20 °C. The sterol extracts were studied by
mixing 20 μL of sample and 100 μL of absolute ethanol
and scanning from 230 to 300 nm using a UV–visible spectrophotometer.
The amount of ergosterol was quantified by using the following equation  where F is the dilution
factor;
290 and 518 are the E values for crystalline ergosterol
and 24(28) dehydroergosterol, respectively.

ROS Generation
ROS level in C. glabrata and CCG3
biofilm cells on exposure to lethal concn of CIN (128 μg
mL–1) and EUG (256 μg mL–1) was studied by adding a mixture of DCFDA (10 μM) and propidium
iodide (1 mg mL–1 PI) in MTP, as described earlier.83 The MTP was incubated in dark for 30 min at
37 °C. For measurement of ROS generation in biofilm cells, DCFDA
fluorescence was recorded at an emission wavelength of 520 nm and
excitation wavelength of 485 nm. Whereas the emission and excitation
wavelength for PI was taken at 617 and 543 nm, respectively. Fluorescence
microscopic images of cells were taken at 40× magnification in
fluorescence microscope.

Biochemical Composition of ECM
ECM
was isolated from C. glabrata and CCG3
biofilm developed in the presence
of CIN and EUG by scrapping it from the MTP well surface using sterile
scrapper and sterile PBS (pH 7.0). The scrapped biofilm was sonicated
(Q700 sonicator, QSonica) at 35 W in an ice bath for five cycles of
30 s each, as described by Fonseca et al.84 The suspension was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant
was then used for biochemical and enzymatic analysis of ECM, whereas
the cell pellet was used for catalase activity measurement. The ECM
was examined for carbohydrate, protein, and eDNA quantification. Phenol–sulfuric
acid method was used for total carbohydrate estimation with glucose
as a standard. Briefly, 1 mL of H2SO4, 200 μL
of phenol (5% w/v), and 100 μL of sample were mixed in glass
tubes. The tubes were then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Then,
tubes were cooled and the absorbance was measured at 485 nm. For total
protein measurement, BCA kit was used with bovine serum albumin (BSA)
as a standard. The absorbance was measured at 562 nm. The quantity
of eDNA in sample was measured by precipitating the eDNA. Precipitation
was done by adding one-tenth the volume of sodium acetate (3 M) in
a sample, followed by adding phenol, chloroform, and isoamyl alcohol
(25:24:1). The aqueous layer was collected in fresh tube, and 2.5
volume of ethanol was added to precipitate the eDNA. The purity of
eDNA was checked by using nanodrop by 260/280 ratio.

Phospholipase
and Proteinase Activity
At neutral pH,
the activity was measured by preparing the substrate consisting of
50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1.6 mM phosphatidylcholine (min. 41%),
0.25% Triton X-100, 20 mM AlCl3, and 0.124% bromothymol
blue. The solution was then filtered and stored at 4 °C. Before
absorbance was measured, the pH of ECM was adjusted to 7.5 with 10
mM NaOH. The phospholipasic activities were determined by mixing 100
μL of ECM with 900 μL of substrate and the reading was
taken at OD630 nm. The specific phospholipase activity
was recorded as the absorbance shift per minute of the reaction. The
proteinase activity was determined by mixing 1% w/v azocasein substrate
with the supernatants and incubating it at 37 °C for 1 h. Trichloroacetic
acid (10%) was used to stop the reaction, and the mixture was centrifuged
for 5 min at 12 000 rpm. The supernatant obtained was then mixed with
0.5 M NaOH and incubated for 15 min. The proteinase activity was measured
at 440 nm. The specific proteinase activity was the amount of enzyme
that elicited an increase of 0.001 units in absorbance per minute
of reaction.83

Catalase Activity
The catalase activity of CIN- and
EUG-treated C. glabrata and CCG3 sessile
cells collected after ECM isolation were lysed with glass beads.85 The samples were then centrifuged at 10 000
rpm, and the supernatant was collected. For determining the catalase
activity, 333 μL of 50 mM H2O2, 567 μL
of PBS (pH 7.0), and 100 μL of supernatant were mixed, followed
by measuring absorbance of sample at 240 nm. One unit of catalase
activity corresponded to the amount of enzyme that decomposes 1 μmol
of H2O2 per minute of reaction at 37 °C.
The catalase activity (U/mg) was calculated using the following formula  where, A0 – A2 is
the difference in absorbance; Vt is the
total volume of reaction; Vs is the volume
of sample; Σ240 is the molar
extinction coefficient for H2O2; d is the optical path length of cuvette; and Ct is the protein concentration in sample.

Hydrophobicity
Assay
To determine hydrophobicity, overnight
grown C. glabrata and CCG3 cell at
0.1 OD600 were exposed to subinhibitory concentration of
CIN (64 μg mL–1) and EUG (128 μg mL–1) and then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells
were harvested after incubation, washed with sterile PBS, and suspended
in 3 mL of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at a concentration
of 2 × 106 cells mL–1. Octane (500
μL) was then added to cell suspension and vortexed for 1 min.
Cells present in aqueous phase were calculated by taking absorbance
at OD600.86 The HI was calculated
by the following equation  where A1 is the
absorbance of inoculum and A2 is the absorbance
of aqueous phase.

Cytochrome c Determination
Briefly,
early stationary phase cells were diluted in PBS to a concentration
of 1 × 107 cells mL–1 and further
incubated in 3 mL of YPD broth containing CIN (128 μg mL–1) and EUG (256 μg mL–1) separately
at 30 °C for 24 h. The cells were washed with PBS, and the pellet
was suspended in the homogenization medium [50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) 2
mM EDTA, 2% glucose, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride]. The
suspension was vortexed and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The
supernatant so obtained was again centrifuged at 20 000 rpm for 45
min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was quantified for cyt c released from mitochondria to cytoplasm. Whereas the pellet
was suspended in 50 mM Tris (pH 5.0) having 2 mM EDTA and incubated
for 5 min at 37 °C. The dissolved pellet again centrifuged at
10 000 rpm for 30 s was used for the determination of cyt c remaining in mitochondria. Protein content in the supernatant
and the pellet was estimated by Bradford reagent kit, using BSA as
the standard. Before quantifying cyt c quantity in
supernatant and pellet, both were reduced with 500 mg L–1 ascorbic acid at room temperature for 5 min, and the absorbance
was measured at 550 nm.70

Mitochondrial
Membrane Potential
For studying the change
in MMP, log phase C. glabrata cells
were incubated in SDB medium with or without CIN and EUG for 6 h at
37 °C in shaking. After incubation, cells were collected by centrifugation
and washed with PBS (pH 7.0). Then, cells were suspended in 10 mM
HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5% glucose and 100 nM rhodamine B.
The suspension was incubated for 30 min in dark at 37 °C. After
incubation, cells were washed and MMP was visualized by fluorescence
microscope at the excitation wavelength of 555 nm and emission wavelength
of 579 nm.87

FESEM Measurements
FESEM was used to monitor the morphological
changes in C. glabrata and CCG3 (resistant
isolate) biofilm cells before and after treatment with CIN and EUG.
Briefly, 1 cm2 polystyrene discs were incubated in fetal
calf serum for 24 h. After incubation, polystyrene discs were placed
in 24-well plates, and 1 mL of cell suspension prepared in RPMI medium
was added. Plates were incubated for 48 h, and then medium was replaced
with CIN- and EUG-containing media. Plates were again incubated for
24 h after which discs were washed with PBS and fixed overnight in
2.5% gluteraldehyde solution. Discs were then again washed with PBS
and treated with ethanol gradient. Air dried samples were mounted
on stubs, and gold sputtering was done. Finally, samples were visualized
under FESEM at a voltage of 15 kV and magnification from 1000 to 5000×.88

Release of Nucleic Acid Content
The rate of release
of nucleic acid from C. glabrata and
CCG3 cells exposed to CIN (128 μg mL–1) and
EUG (256 μg mL–1) for 2, 4, and 8 h at 37
°C was measured by taking absorbance at 260 nm.89 Cells exposed to alcoholic KOH which causes 100% cellular
leakage were used as a reference sample. The sample was centrifuged
at 5000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant collected was used for
measuring the intracellular leakage in terms of rate of release of
DNA from C. glabrata and CCG3 cells.

Fluorescence Microscopy Studies
For studying the effect
of CIN and EUG on the biofilm cell viability, biofilm of C. glabrata and CCG3 developed was washed with PBS
(pH 7.0) after CIN and EUG treatment. Then, biofilm was stained with
FDA (2 μg mL–1 fluorescein diacetate) and
PI (0.6 μg mL–1 propidium iodide).90 Plate was incubated for 20 min at room temperature
in dark, and wells were washed before visualization under fluorescence
microscope. All images were captured at 40× magnification.

Transcriptional Analysis
Effect of CIN (32 μg
mL–1) and EUG (64 μg mL–1) subinhibitory concentration on the expression of selected C. glabrata and CCG3 was studied by qRT-PCR. Log-phase
cells were treated with CIN and EUG in YPD broth. Total RNA was extracted
from cells by using RNeasy kit, QIAGEN by following manufacturer’s
instructions. The RNA was quantified by a nanodrop (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), which was used for cDNA synthesis using Verso cDNA synthesis
kit, Thermo. Primers for RT-PCR of the above-mentioned genes and housekeeping
gene (ACT1) were designed by using Primer Quest,
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and were synthesized by IDT (Table 3). SYBR green mix
(Applied Biosystems) was used in Mastercycler for qRT-PCR. cDNA template
(100 ng) and gene-specific forward and reverse primers (200 nM) were
used in the reaction. The following parameters were used for qRT-PCR:
an initial denaturation at 95 °C (3 min), followed by 40 cycles
of denaturation (95 °C/30 s), annealing (52 °C/30 s), and
extension (72 °C/30 s), melting-curve analysis starting from
initial temperature 45 to 95 °C, with a gradual increase in 0.5
°C/15 s. Specificity of the primers was confirmed by the melting
curve analysis. The generated CT values of target genes were normalized
to the CT value of housekeeping ACT1 gene. Relative
expression fold changes were evaluated by ΔΔCT method
using 2–ΔΔCT formula.91

Biofilm Study on Biomaterials
Commercially
available
urinary catheter (silicone) and contact eye lens were procured from
a local medical store and were used as biomaterials for biofilm study.
Contact lens were used as a whole, whereas 1 cm long pieces of urinary
catheter coupons were cut out and sterilized with 100% ethylene oxide
and kept under UV for 4 h.92−94 Sterile lens and catheter coupons
were incubated in RPMI medium containing 1 × 107 cells
mL–1 for 48 h. Biomaterials with biofilms were treated
for 24 h with CIN and EUG containing RPMI and then was quantified
by XTT reduction assay.

Statistical Analysis
All experiments
were performed
in triplicates, and the values presented the mean with standard deviation,
obtained from three different observations for each assay. Student’s t-test was used for the statistical analysis, and a value
of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant
(*), P < 0.01 as highly significant (**) and P < 0.001 as extremely significant (***).
