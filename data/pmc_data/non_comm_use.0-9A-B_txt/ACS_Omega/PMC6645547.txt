A nonclassical
multistep pathway involving bottom-up and break-down
stages for the evolution of calcite nanograins ∼50 nm in size
was demonstrated in a basic aqueous system. Calcite nanofibrils ∼10
nm wide were produced as the initial crystalline phase via amorphous
calcium carbonate through ion-by-ion assembly by the carbonation of
Ca(OH)2 at a high pH of ∼13. Bundles ∼50
nm in diameter were then formed by the subsequent oriented attachment
of the nanofibrils. Monodispersed calcite nanograins were finally
obtained through spontaneous fragmentation of the fibrous forms via
a decrease in pH by further carbonation.

Introduction
Monodispersed nanocrystals
have attracted much attention because
of their specific properties originating from a high specific surface
area, high dispersivity, and quantum size effects.1−6 Nanometer-scale crystals of metal oxides and sulfides are utilized
as phosphors, catalysts, photocatalysts, fillers, and raw materials
for sintered ceramics. In general, miniaturization of crystalline
grains to the nanometer scale is achieved by either a break-down or
bottom-up process. The size and shape of the resultant grains are
not strictly controlled by break-down routes, such as the grinding
and milling of large crystals. Uniform nanometer-scale grains are
commonly synthesized via homogeneous nucleation and subsequent growth
as a bottom-up route through the accumulation of ions or molecules
as illustrated in Figure 1a.7−14 The grain size and distribution are adjusted on a nanoscale by changing
the frequency of nucleation and the inhibition of growth by adding
modifying agents. In the present article, we report a multistep formation
process of nanoscale crystalline grains through ion-by-ion accumulation
to fibrils and their oriented attachment in the bottom-up stage and
subsequent fragmentation in the break-down stage, as illustrated in Figure 1b. Monodispersed
nanograins are produced via a nonclassical complex pathway including
bottom-up and spontaneous break-down stages.

Calcium carbonate is an important material in various industrial
fields. Specifically, calcite particles are commonly used as fillers
for papers, rubbers, plastics, and paints. The size variation of calcite
particles at the nanometer scale is essential to control the optical
and mechanical properties of host materials.15,16 Wet chemical processes using aqueous systems are applied for the
fabrication of nanometer-scale calcite particles. The shape and size
of calcite crystals are varied by conditioning the reaction time,
solute concentrations, temperature, and the addition of modifying
agents.17,18 Monodispersed calcite nanocrystals are conventionally
produced without modifying agents by the carbonation of a calcium
hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) aqueous dispersion as an industrial
process.18,19 The control parameters have been established
for industrial fabrication of stably dispersed calcite nanocrystals
without modifying agents. However, the evolution mechanisms of calcite
nanocrystals without modifying agents have not been clarified sufficiently
in the conventional aqueous systems. Thus, we monitored the evolution
of calcite nanocrystals carefully and then found that the nanocrystals
were formed through a nonconventional route.

Calcite is regarded
as a major crystalline phase of biominerals,
such as seashells,20,21 eggshells,22,23 and the skeletons of sea urchins24,25 and foraminifera.26−28 In recent years, it has been shown that specific hierarchical architectures
in various calcite-based biominerals exhibit mesoscopic granular textures
consisting of nanocrystals 10–100 nm in size.29,30 The subunits of calcite nanocrystals are arranged in the same crystallographic
direction in the body of biominerals. Specific properties of the biominerals
are ascribed to ordered architectures formed by the oriented nanocrystals.
Nonclassical pathways, such as the presence of amorphous intermediates
and oriented attachment of unit grains, have been proposed for the
production of specific hierarchical architectures.24,25,31,32 In previous
works, organic molecules were reported to promote the nonclassical
crystallization routes. Hence, biomimetic and bioinspired mineralization
through amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) and oriented attachment
has been studied using aqueous systems including organic modifiers.33,34 However, we showed that the presence of organic molecules is not
essential on the nonclassical pathway for the crystallization of calcium
carbonate.35−37 Further investigation of the evolution of calcite
crystals on a nanometer scale without organic species is still important
to understand the nature of calcium carbonate.

In the present
work, we monitored changes in the morphology of
calcite nanocrystals produced by the carbonation of Ca(OH)2 suspension. The results show a nonclassical multistep pathway for
the evolution of monodispersed calcite nanograins including ion-by-ion
accumulation, particle-by-particle assembly, and spontaneous fragmentation.
Our findings reveal the specific nature of calcium carbonate on crystallization.
Moreover, this is the first report on a nonclassical complex route
for the evolution of uniform nanometer-scale grains via both bottom-up
and break-down stages.

Experimental Section
We studied
the evolution of calcite nanocrystals in the procedure
reported in our previous article.35 Detailed
procedures were described in the Supporting Information. Calcite crystals were synthesized in a 200 cm3 aqueous
dispersion of 42.5 g dm–3 Ca(OH)2 (Figure S1) through carbonation by the introduction
of CO2 at a rate of 3.0 dm3 min–1. The formation of calcite nanocrystals in the aqueous system was
monitored with the variation of pH by carbonation. The system was
neutralized by the introduction of CO2. The evolution of
calcium compounds was divided into five steps as shown in Figures 2 and 3 on the basis of the pH variation and the reaction mode monitored
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20, operated
at 200 kV) with selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The dispersion
was dropped on a copper grid covered with a collodion film for TEM
observation of the products.

Results and Discussion
In step 1,
ACC was formed with the dissolution of Ca(OH)2 crystals
(Figure 3a). In step
2, calcite nanofibrils ∼10 nm wide were produced
at a constant pH of ∼13 (Figure 3b). The nanofibrils were bundled by further carbonation
in step 3 (Figure 3c). Uniform calcite nanograins ∼50 nm in diameter were then
formed through spontaneous fragmentation of the fibrous forms via
a steep decrease in pH in step 4 (Figure 3d). Finally, monodispersed nanograins were
obtained by neutralization in step 5 (Figure 3e).

In step 1 (reaction period (RP):
∼5 min (Figure 2a)), the pH value slightly
decreased with the introduction of CO2. Here, spherical
nanoparticles ∼50 nm in diameter were produced in the basic
dispersion (Figure 3a). Raman signals around ∼1080 cm–1 were
assigned to calcium carbonate (Figure 2b),38 but no spots were
observed in the SAED pattern (Figure 3a3). Raman signals (Figures 2b and S2) at 175
and 270 cm–1 originating from the crystalline lattice
were broadened and shifted from the original positions for calcite.39,40 Thus, the spherical nanoparticles were deduced to be ACC. XRD signals
from Ca(OH)2 were still observed because of the residual
reactant (Figure 2c).

In step 2 (RP: 5–10 min (Figure 2a)), nucleation on the surface of ACC and
the formation of nanofibrils ∼10 nm wide due to elongation
from outside of ACC were observed in the dispersion (Figure 3b). Distinct signals assigned
to calcite were observed in Raman scattering spectra (Figures 2b and S2). According to the SAED pattern for a bundle consisting
of fibrils (Figure 3c6), these fibrils are assigned to be calcite crystals,
whereas XRD signals assigned to calcite were not recognized (Figure 2c). The amount of
calcite in the step was insufficient for the detection of distinct
diffraction patterns by a normal XRD apparatus.

In step 3 (RP:
10–15 min (Figure 2a)), diffraction signals of calcite were
clearly detected in XRD patterns with the disappearance of Ca(OH)2 by further carbonation of the dispersion (Figure 2c). The nanofibrils were attached
to each other, and bundles ∼50 nm in diameter and >1 μm
in length were formed in the dispersion (Figure 3c). Direct observation of the oriented attachment
is usually difficult by conventional methods. We rearranged several
TEM images of nanofibrils in step 2 and step 3 to clarify the oriented
attachment in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). According to spots in the SAED pattern (Figure 3c6), the bundles
of several fibrils exhibited a single crystalline feature. The TEM
images and the SAED pattern suggest that the bundles of calcite were
produced through the oriented attachment of nanofibrils elongated
in the c direction.

In step 4 (RP: 15–20
min (Figure 2a)), rugged
surfaces were formed with the
fusion of nanofibrils in the bundles with a decrease in pH (Figure 3d). When the pH of
the dispersion decreased to ∼7, we observed infinite nanograins
∼50 nm in size. Finally, monodispersed nanocrystals were obtained
after the neutralization in step 5 (Figures 3e1 and S4). Rhombohedral grains were unifaceted, with {104} faces (Figure 3e2–3).

As mentioned above, calcite nanograins were produced in
the basic
solution system through a nonclassical pathway divided into five steps
involving bottom-up and subsequent break-down stages. Step 1 is the
formation process of a metastable amorphous phase as a precursor of
the stable crystalline phase. Step 2 is a classical growth pathway
to crystal formation involving nucleation and growth with dissolution
of the precursor. Step 3 is
a bundling process by the oriented attachment of subunits regarded
as a nonclassical growth route. Step 4 is a fragmentation process
as a spontaneous break-down stage to form nanograins.

Spherical
ACC particles were observed in step 1 (Figure 3a). The metastable amorphous
phase is usually formed under a high supersaturated condition. A large
amount of calcium ions supplied by the dissolution of Ca(OH)2 is rapidly reacted with CO32– by the
introduction of CO2 in the basic dispersion. The amorphous
phase is usually stabilized in the presence of organic agents.41,42 Here, in the present system, ACC without organic molecules would
enter crystalline phases easily.

As shown in Figure 2a, ACC and calcite fibrils
coexisted in step 2 (RP: 5–10 min)
and the first half of step 3 (RP: 10–13 min). Thus, the transformation
of the amorphous phase to calcite occurred in those stages (RP: 5–13
min). In the initial step 2, the nucleation of calcite nanocrystals
was observed on the surface of ACC spheres, not inside the precursor
(Figure 3b). Moreover,
the elongation of calcite occurs on the outside of ACC. These facts
indicate that calcite fibrils are formed from the nuclei via the accumulation
of Ca2+ and CO32– ions supplied
by dissolution of ACC. It means that the dissolution–deposition
process was dominant for the formation of calcite fibrils rather than
solid-state transition in the present study. In previous works, the
amorphous phase stabilized by organic molecules was reported to change
calcite directly.43,44 In the current system, however,
ACC without organic agents is rapidly dissolved in the aqueous system.
The growth of calcite fibrils was then observed on the surface of
ACC by the deposition of supersaturated ions. Rhombohedral shapes
are usually formed with the stable {104} faces of calcite. However,
the crystal body is elongated in the c direction
under basic conditions (Figure 4a). The growth of faces parallel to the c-axis of calcite is inferred to be inhibited by OH– in this system. Figure 4c shows the ion positions of the (100) and (001) faces of
calcite. Anionic and cationic planes in the calcite lattice are alternatively
stacked in the c direction. The OH– ions on the (001) planes are deduced to be easily replaced by CO32– ions because of a large difference of
their ion sizes. Thus, Ca2+ ions are provided immediately
to the CO32– ions. Calcite is then elongated
in the c direction via ion-by-ion accumulation as
the initial step in the bottom-up stage.

Figure 4 Schematic illustrations
of the multistep pathway for the formation
of nanograins involving bottom-up (a) and break-down stage (b) and
atomic location of calcite surfaces under a high pH condition (c).

In step 3, calcite nanofibrils
are bundled through oriented attachment
(Figure 4a). Further
carbonation replaces OH– with CO32– on the side faces of fibrils with a slight decrease
in pH. The presence of Ca2+ ions promotes side-by-side
attachment of the carbonated fibrils. Thus, bundled rods are formed
through particle-by-particle accumulation as the second step in the
bottom-up stage to reduce the total surface energy. Here, the crystallographic
direction of the fibrils is inferred to be aligned in the same orientation.

In step 4, spontaneous fragmentation of calcite bundles occurs
as the break-down stage after fusion of the fibrils with a drop in
pH (Figure 4b). Partial
dissolution–redeposition is enhanced around the calcite bundles
by increasing the solubility of calcite crystals with neutralization.
The fragmentation of nanorods is induced by increasing the solubility
with decreasing pH. Thus, the chemical components of acid for neutralization
are not essential for fragmentation. The grain boundary in the bundles
would disappear with the reconstruction. The fragmentation is caused
by the formation of the most stable {104} faces on the side of bundles.
The stable faces are enlarged under the neutral condition. On the
other hand, we obtained calcite nanofibers before fragmentation from
the basic dispersion at pH ≈ 12 in step 4.35

In step 5, monodispersed nanograins are finally produced
by the
fragmentation of bundles in a neutral system (Figure 4b). Rhombohedral grains are unifaceted with
the most stable {104} faces (Figure 4b). Moreover, calcite nanograins are stably dispersed
because their surface is positively charged outside of the isoelectric
point (pH 11.5).

The essence of multistep evolution of calcite
nanocrystals is a
change in the growth mode with the variation of pH by carbonation.
A high degree of supersaturation in the initial step (step 1) is buffered
by the formation of the amorphous phase. The nucleation of calcite
occurs with dissolution of the amorphous phase, and subsequent preferential
growth in the c direction is then induced at a high
pH of ∼13 (step 2). A slight decrease in pH reduces the repulsion
force on the side face of fibrous forms elongated on the c-axis and promotes their oriented attachment (step 3). A drop in
pH enhances the morphological change with the formation of stable
faces of calcite. Finally, nanograins covered with the stable faces
are formed with the neutralization (step 4). The change in growth
mode from the bottom-up stage to the break-down stage is ascribed
to the pH variation. The formation of calcite rods and granular textures
in foraminifera shells was reported to be induced under a high pH
condition.45 Our finding of various growth
modes of calcite depending on the pH would be useful for understanding
the formation mechanism of these fascinating biogenic architectures.

Conclusions
We reported a nonclassical complex pathway for nanocrystal formation
via bottom-up and break-down stages through an amorphous phase. The
evolution of calcite nanocrystals from Ca(OH)2 was demonstrated
via the carbonation of a basic aqueous system. Monodispersed calcite
nanograins ∼50 nm in diameter were produced through the formation
of nanofibrils ∼10 nm wide and the subsequent oriented attachment
of fibrils to bundles ∼50 nm wide (bottom-up stage) and spontaneous
fragmentation of the fibers (break-down stage). These results show
the specific nature of calcium carbonate, which is an important material
not only for industrial applications but also in biogenic fields,
with regard to the evolution of the crystal phase and morphology in
aqueous systems.
