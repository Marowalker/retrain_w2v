Morphology-controlled
precipitation of three powerful organic high
energetic compounds (HECs) viz. cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX),
octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), and 2-methyl-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene
(TNT) was achieved by two different processes, namely, drop-by-drop
(DBD) and drop-to-drop (DTD) solvent–antisolvent interaction
methods. Effect of different experimental parameters on the mean size
and morphology of the prepared submicron-sized particles of HECs was
investigated thoroughly. The DBD method favors the formation of nanosized
particles of RDX and TNT at lower concentrations (5 mM). However,
a significant increase in the mean particle size occurred at higher
concentrations (25 and 50 mM). Formation of facetted crystals of RDX,
HMX, and nanorods of TNT was observed at higher concentrations because
of the interaction of crystal facets with the antisolvent. Relatively,
smaller sized, spherical particles of RDX and HMX could be prepared
through the DTD method even at higher concentrations (25 mM). The
DTD method is a continuous process and hence is a facile method for
industrial applications. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy studies revealed that RDX, HMX and TNT were precipitated
in their most stable polymorphic forms α, β, and monoclinic,
respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the thermal
response of the nano-HECs was similar to the respective raw-HECs.
A slight decrease in crystallinity and the melting point was observed
because of the decrease in the mean particle size.

1 Introduction
High
energetic compounds (HECs) have significant applications in
military munitions as well as in solid propellants. HECs often have
the contradictory requirements of properties, that is, having less
sensitivity toward external stimuli such as shock, impact, and friction
while possessing high energy density. The physical and chemical
properties of explosive compounds affect their sensitivity toward
external stimuli.1,2 Accordingly, there are two fundamental
ways to reduce the sensitivity of explosives. First, new HEC molecules
having lower sensitivity could be designed and synthesized with the
help of molecular modeling. The second strategy is to reduce the sensitivity
of existing HECs through crystal engineering. Although there have
been many attempts to synthesize new chemical entities to meet the
stringent requirements of HECs, limited success could only be achieved
through the molecular modeling routes. This is the major reason for
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine
(HMX) being widely used today, even though they were developed many
decades ago.3−5 Powerful explosives such as CL-20 (hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane)
and octanitrocubane have much higher energy density than RDX and HMX.4,6 However, their sensitivity to accidental stimuli is a matter of
grave concern.

Recently, it has been realized that physical
properties such as
crystal size, shape, morphology, purity, inclusions, and crystal defects
can be altered to improve the performance of existing explosives.1 With the advent of nanotechnology, it has been
realized that particle size reduction is an effective way of reducing
sensitivity while enhancing performance. Novel behavior in deflagration
to detonation transition was observed with submicron (SM) particles.7 A few studies have indicated that the particle
size of explosives has an influence on impact sensitivity and maximum
energy output from a detonation.8 When
explosives were nanosized, the crystal defects, voids, and solvent
inclusion also become less, resulting in lower sensitivity.9,10 Many reports on the relationship between the sensitivity and crystal
size showed that smaller explosive particles have less sensitivity,
and this effect is still valid for the sub-micrometer scale RDX particles.11,12 The shape of the particles also significantly influences the sensitivity.
For example, RDX particles having a spheroidal shape with a smoothened
surface have less shock sensitivity than facetted particles.13

Akkbarzade et al. calculated inter- and
intramolecular energies
and sublimation enthalpies per molecule of HMX crystals of different
sizes through molecular dynamic simulation to investigate the stability
of nanoscale high energetic compounds (HECs). Results revealed that
sublimation enthalpies increased with the increase of the particle
size.14 Around 10 °C decrease in thermal
decomposition temperature of nano-TATB was observed when compared
with micro TATB.15 Wang et al. have reduced
the particle size of RDX successfully from 87 μm to 270 nm by
the milling method and analyzed the factors affecting the safety of
explosives by combining Khasanov’s and Merzhanov’s models
to establish the relationship between the mean particle size, critical
temperature, and critical size of hot spots.16 They concluded that the mean particle size does not affect sensitivity,
unless the mean particle size is lower than 400 nm. Their study also
revealed that nanoscale level materials had lower sensitivity than
the raw materials because of the small hot-spot size and high critical
hot-spot temperature.16 Guo et al. prepared
CL20 nanoparticles with a particle size of 200 nm by utilizing ball-milling
technology.17 Liu et al. used bidirectional
grinding mill technology to convert micron-sized particles of RDX,
HMX, and CL-20 to nanosized particles.9 All the nanosized particles showed lower friction and impact sensitivities
than the bulk-sized particles.

Plastic-bonded explosives which
are prepared utilizing nano-HEMs
also showed decrease in shock sensitivity and enhancement in detonation
velocities.9 Han et al. have prepared nano-HMX
through mechanical trituration process and utilized them in composite
modified double base propellant containing RDX. The nano-HMX showed
lower impact and friction sensitivities compared with raw HMX while
the performance of propellant improved 30% compared to raw-HMX.18 Ma et al. prepared TATB-coated HMX crystals
of size ranging from 10 to 25 μm through spray drying process
using Estane 5703 as a binder. The prepared core–shell crystals
showed improved performance of explosion and superior mechanical properties.19 Compared with core–shell crystals, HMX
and TATB nanoparticles showed relatively poor impact and friction
sensitivities because of critical hot-spot formation.19 Thus, preparation of micrometer or sub-micrometer-sized
solid particles is of great interest in explosives. In the past several
decades, there were many unintended accidents by explosives such as
USS Forrestal fire in the year 1967,20 Camp
Doha, Kuwait fire in 1991,21 Texas
city disaster in 1947,22 explosions in
Toulouse, France in 2001,23 and Ryongchon,
South Korea in 2004.24 It is thus imperative
to lower the sensitivity of explosives to accidental stimuli. The
above-mentioned studies clearly established the possibility of lowering
the sensitivity of conventional explosive compounds while maintaining
or augmenting their performance by particle size reduction.15

Some of the methods of preparing SM-sized
HECs include rapid crystallization
from solvent by the addition of antisolvent,25,26 sol–gel method,27,28 rapid expansion of
supercritical solution,29,30 mechanical milling,9,31 and aero-sol method.32 As HECs are very
sensitive to mechanical stimuli, some of these methods such as mechanical
milling could be hazardous. Moreover, modulation of the particle shape
remains as an open challenge during these processes. Precipitation
of the organic solute by the interaction with an antisolvent is the
basis for most of the methods for making nanoparticles of organic
compounds.33 Instantaneous precipitation
occurs by a rapid desolvation of the hydrophobic active ingredient
in the antisolvent medium, when water is used as an antisolvent for
organic compounds having poor aqueous solubility.25,26

It is possible to prepare nanosized particles of simple organic
compounds by finding the suitable solvent–antisolvent pairs
and experimental conditions to enhance the rate of supersaturation.
We have recently developed the evaporation-assisted solvent–antisolvent
interaction (EASAI) method by enhancing the rate of supersaturation.34,35 Nanoparticles of HECs (RDX and HMX) were prepared by the EASAI method
using acetone as solvent at 70 °C.36 This method is not only limited to HECs but also useful for the
nanoformulation of different simple organic compounds. Nanocrystals
of various poorly water-soluble drugs could be prepared using the
EASAI method to enhance their solubility and hence the bioavailability.37−39 However, the EASAI method is essentially a batch process, and it
is challenging to increase the solid loading in the antisolvent. In
the present work, we explored the feasibility of converting the batch
process into a continuous process. Additionally, we have also explored
the possibility of increasing the solid loading while tuning the particle
morphology. The solvent was added to antisolvent in two different
ways. Drop-by-drop (DBD) addition of the solvent into an antisolvent
helped us to increase the solid loading, whereas drop-to-drop (DTD)
mixing of the solvent and antisolvent yielded SM-sized particles continuously
in flow. The methods were used to prepare SM-sized particles of HECs
such as RDX, HMX, and 2-methyl-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNT), and the
results are presented here.

2 Results and Discussion
Mixing the solvent with the antisolvent using MITOS pressure-pump
in both modes adopted, that is, DBD addition and DTD mixing, resulted
in the formation of SM-sized particles of the respective HECs. However,
the objective of each mode of mixing was different. In the conventional
EASAI method, a single spray of the solution onto the surface of the
antisolvent was used to yield very fine nanoparticles.38,40 However, increasing the solid loading remains a challenge to be
addressed, as increasing the concentration or the ratio of solvent
to antisolvent results in relatively larger particles. In the DBD
method, the solution was added DBD to the antisolvent, using microfluidics
MITOS pressure-pump at the optimized experimental conditions of the
EASAI method. However, in the DTD method, a drop of the solvent was
added to a drop of the antisolvent, resulting in a final drop where
supersaturation followed by nucleation and growth of nanoparticles
occurred. To investigate the suitable interaction condition of the
solvent with the antisolvent, we have thoroughly characterized all
the prepared nano-HECs. There are many different parameters that affected
the mean particle size and shape. To prepare SM-HEC particles with
spherical morphology, smaller particle size, and narrow size distribution,
we had investigated the effect of different experimental parameters
systematically. The mean size of the particles that was formed under
each condition was monitored using dynamic light scattering (DLS).
The effect of different parameters is discussed in the following sections.

2.1 Effect of Concentration
A series
of experiments were performed by using solutions of different concentrations
(5, 25, and 50 mM) to investigate the effect of concentration on the
particle size and morphology. The particle size distribution profiles
as per the DLS data are given in Figures S1 and S2 (the Supporting Information), respectively, for DBD
and DTD methods. From Table 1, it is clear that the mean particle size of the SM-HEC particles
increase significantly as the concentration of HECs in solution increases
in the DBD method. Such an increase in the size of the particles with
concentration was observed in our previous studies also.35 This can be explained based on continued growth
of the nuclei because of the availability of enough growth species
after the nucleation at high concentrations. However, there was only
relatively lesser increase in the mean particle size with increasing
solution concentration using the DTD mixing method (Table 2). This may be due to the confinement
of the particle growth in the combined drop whose size is a constant,
irrespective of the concentration. Moreover, the solvent to antisolvent
interfacial area also remains the same in DBD method leading to the
formation of more nuclei with increasing concentration. Hence, relatively
lesser increase in mean particle size was observed in the DTD method
compared with the DBD method where chance of heterogeneous nucleation
was also there due to the presence of particles that are grown from
the initially added drops.

Representative
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
images of the HEC particles that were prepared using DBD method from
solutions of various concentrations are presented in Figure 1. Change in the size as well
as the shape of the HEC particles with the change in experimental
conditions is evident from Figure 1. RDX and TNT nanoparticles having a spherical morphology
were observed when the concentration of their respective solutions
was 5 mM while facetted crystals of relatively larger particles of
HMX were observed at the same concentration. At higher concentrations
(25 and 50 mM), RDX particles also got precipitated as facetted crystals
like HMX, whereas TNT particles remained spherical even at 25 mM,
and then, rod-shaped crystals were formed at 50 mM. Thus, the mean
particle size and shape also depends on the organic compound being
crystallized.

by
DBD solvent–antisolvent interaction using different concentrations.

The DTD method seems to be unique,
as monodispersed particles of
the HECs having spherical morphology could be prepared using this
method as shown in Figure 2. RDX and HMX yielded well-dispersed spherical particles,
whereas TNT yielded twinned spherical particles. Formation of spherical
particles clearly indicates the confinement of nanoparticle growth
within the combined droplets of the solution and antisolvent. The
twinned spherical morphology of TNT particles points toward the unique
progression of diffusion of the solvent and antisolvent from the interface
of each drops. Variation in morphology of the particles of different
HECs under similar experimental conditions clearly point out the effect
of solubility, crystal structure, and precipitation kinetics on the
morphology.

DTD solvent–antisolvent interaction method using different
concentrations.

Controlling the shape
of particles in the crystallization process
is still a challenge because the shape of the particles not only depends
on internal defects but also on the external particle growth conditions.
Experimental conditions such as the crystallization method, temperature,
supersaturation, solvent, and additives are known to affect particle
morphologies.41−43 Computational simulations were applied to predict
the particle morphology using growth mechanism such as Bravais, Friedel,
Donnay, and Harker rules,44 Monte Carlo
simulation,45 attached energy model and
its modification,46 the occupancy model,47 the spiral growth model,48 and two-dimensional nucleation model.49

Recently, Liu et al. studied the effect of the solvent
(acetone)
at the five growth faces of RDX particles through computational simulation
using molecular dynamics method along with quantum chemistry calculations.50 It was reported that morphology of RDX particles
is dominated by five growth faces viz. (111), (200), (020), (002),
and (210). The binding affinity of the solvent (acetone) varies with
the crystal faces in the following order: (002) ≈ (210) >
(200)
> (020) > (111). These results also showed good agreement with
the
experimental RDX morphology grown in acetone.50 Experimental studies conducted by Van der Heijden et al. revealed
that the change in morphology of particles of RDX, HMX, and CL-20
was due to the interaction between solvent and growth faces, variations
in supersaturation, and presence of impurities.12 They concluded that with the increase of supersaturation
above 40%, particles with random orientations were formed.12 Thus, in the present case, variation in crystal
morphologies of RDX, HMX, and TNT just by varying their concentrations
in acetone, under identical conditions may be due to the interaction
between the growing particles and the medium. In the DBD method, there
is a possibility of heterogeneous nucleation taking place. This could
also affect the morphology when compared with the DTD method as well
as the EASAI method. The nucleation and growth of nuclei in DBD, DTD,
and EASAI are shown in Scheme 1. Homogeneous nucleation led to the formation of spherical
RDX particles at the same concentration (25 mM) using the DTD method
as well as EASAI method.35

during EASAI, DBD, and DTD Methods of Precipitation of the HECs
Solubility is another major
parameter affecting the final morphology
of particles of HECs during crystallization in the DBD method. The
solubility of HECs in water is the deciding factor for the supersaturation
rate. Solubility of HECs in water at 20 °C is in the following
order: TNT (94.0–100.7 mg/L) > RDX (35.1–38.9 mg/mL)
> HMX (3.68–3.97 mg/mL).51 However,
there is a chance of enhancement in solubility of the solute in the
presence of a mixture of solvents. Kim, D.-Y. and Kim, K.-J. studied
the solubility of RDX in binary solvent mixture of acetone and water.52 Compared with mixtures of other solvents with
water, RDX showed the lowest solubility in the acetone and water mixture.
The solubility increased with increasing temperature and decreased
with the increasing water content in the mixture.52 At fixed concentration of HECs, that is, 5 mM, the mean
particle size of HECs also followed the following trend: SM-HMX >
SM-RDX > SM-TNT. Thus, it is clear that, at fixed concentration
of
compounds, higher solubility of TNT in the antisolvent resulted in
the formation of smaller sized particles with a spherical morphology.

In addition, with the increase of concentration, an increase in
mean particle size and formation of facetted particles were observed
for RDX and HMX. However, for TNT, as the concentration increases
from 5 to 25 mM, only a slight increase of the mean particle size
was observed without any change in the morphology of its particles.
However, at very high concentration, that is 50 mM, very long rod-shaped
particles of TNT were formed. The variation in the morphology of the
HECs at high concentration can be explained based on theoretical and
experimental studies reported so far on the effect of solvent and
interaction of solvent with particle growth faces.12,50 It is reported that stronger interaction suppresses the growth of
the respective face, whereas the faces which are having poor interactions
will grow well. In the DBD method, as well as in the standard EASAI
method, acetone gets quickly evaporated from the surface of the hot
antisolvent. However, very small spherical RDX and HMX nanoparticles
were formed at the same concentration (25 mM) using EASAI method,
whereas large facetted particles were obtained using the DBD method.35 This is clearly due to the heterogeneous nucleation
and growth in the DBD method when compared with the EASAI method.

From Figures 1 and 2, it is clear that the DTD solvent–antisolvent
interaction method is suitable for the preparation of SM-RDX and SM-HMX
particles with a spherical morphology with the mean particle size
below 500 nm. It was interesting to compare the data of raw-HECs with
SM-HEC particles prepared through the DTD solvent–antisolvent
interaction method. We had characterized it thoroughly and discussed
in following sections.

Apart from tuning the particle size and
shape of the crystals of
HECs, it is also critically important to selectively precipitate the
preferred polymorphic form of the HEC. This is because, it is well
established that the HECs exist in various polymorphic forms and their
sensitivity and energetic performance varies with the change in polymorphic
form. For example, α-form of RDX and β-form of HMX are
known to be the most stable polymorphic forms and hence are preferred
for application in munitions. Moreover, solvent inclusion in the crystals
is a possibility while the particles are prepared using solvent–antisolvent
interaction method. Hence, detailed characterization of the prepared
particles was undertaken to ascertain the crystal structure, chemical
compositions, and thermal properties in comparison with the raw-particles
of the HECs.

2.2 Fourier Transform Infrared
Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of raw-HECs along with the prepared
SM-HECs are shown in Figure 3a. It is clear from Figure 3a that the SM-HECs have IR bands similar to the raw-HECs.
The major bands for the RDX samples were 1592 cm–1 (νs NO2), 1270 cm–1 (νs NO2 + ν N–N), 1039
cm–1 (ring stretching bands), 945 and 783 cm–1 (δ NO2 and γ NO2), and 604 cm–1 (τ + γ NO2).35 The major IR bands for HMX samples
were assigned as follows: 1564 cm–1 (νs NO2), 1145 cm–1 (νs NO2, ν ring), 964 and 946 cm–1 (ring stretching bands), 830 cm–1 and 761 of (δ
and γ NO2), and 625 and 600 cm–1 (t + γ NO2).53 The major IR bands for TNT were observed at 3100, 750 cm–1 corresponding to C–H stretch vibrations of
aromatic ring and C–N–O bending. The peaks at 1355 and
1540 cm–1 correspond to C–NO2 symmetric
and asymmetric stretching vibrations, respectively. The presence of
characteristic peaks at 736 and 754 cm–1 in Figure 3a confirmed the formation
of the α-polymorphic form of RDX.54 The absence of any peak in the range of 700–750 cm–1 confirmed the formation of β-polymorph of HMX.55

Figure 3 (a) FTIR spectra and (b) XRD patterns of the prepared
SM-HEC particles
along with the corresponding raw-HECs.

2.3 Powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
RDX
is well known to have at least five different polymorphs: α,
β, γ, δ, and ε. The α-form (orthorhombic, a = 1.3182, b = 1.1574, and c = 1.0709 nm) is the most stable one at room temperature.56,57 HMX may exist as four different polymorphs: α (orthorhombic),
β (monoclinic), γ (monoclinic), and δ (hexagonal)
phase. Among these, the β-HMX (monoclinic, a = 0.65370, b = 1.10540 and c =
0.87018 nm) is highly dense and is the most stable one at room temperature.58,59 The TNT has two polymorphs, monoclinic and orthorhombic forms. The
monoclinic form is the most stable form of TNT at room temperature.60

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the
SM-HECs and the respective raw-HEC are shown in Figure 3b. The XRD pattern of raw-HECs matched well
with the SM-HECs. This clearly indicates that HEC particles made by
DBD and DTD solvent–antisolvent interaction methods are also
crystalline. The XRD patterns of RDX, HMX, and TNT samples showed
similar patterns corresponding to α-RDX, β-HMX, and monoclinic
TNT, respectively.57,61,62 The peaks at 2θ for the RDX samples at 13.1°, 13.4°,
15.4°, 17.4°, 17.8°, 20.4°, 22.0°, 25.4°,
and 29.3° confirmed that the RDX samples were in α-polymorphic
form.35 XRD peaks for the HMX samples at
2θ, 14.7°, 16.0°, 23.0°, 26.1°, 29.6°,
and 31.9°, confirmed that the HMX samples were in β-polymorphic
form.53 Monoclinic form of TNT was confirmed
from the diffraction peaks at 2θ: 17.7°, 25.2°, 26.6°,
29.2°, and 32.5°.60 However,
the relative intensities of various peaks in XRD patterns were different.
Particle size reduction could be the reason for the observed variation
in XRD pattern.63 Variation in the relative
intensities of different peaks in the XRD can also be due to a preferred
orientation of the particles when preparing the samples for XRD. For
instance, in case of the rod-shaped TNT crystals, one could expect
an alignment of the particles, giving rise to a preferred orientation.
This generally results in several strong peaks in the XRD, whereas
other peaks that should normally be present are much smaller or even
absent.

2.4 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermal curves for raw and
SM-HECs are shown in Figure 4, and the observed thermal phenomena are summarized in Table 3. The overall thermal
response of the SM-HECs was very much similar to the raw-HECs.3,5 RDX melts initially and then decompose to give gaseous products.
An endothermic peak corresponding to melting of RDX was observed at
around 204 °C.64 A typical endothermic
peak corresponding to solid-state phase transition from β to
α phase (monoclinic to hexagonal) was observed in HMX samples.3,66−70 This was followed by an exothermic thermal decomposition after 270
°C.65,68 An endothermic peak corresponding to melting
of TNT was observed at around 81 °C followed by another endotherm
around 230 °C corresponding to evaporation. Thermal behavior
of the TNT matched well with literature reports.60,69 The SM-RDX showed a considerable decrease in heat of decomposition
compared with raw-RDX, whereas the heats of decomposition for SM-HMX
and raw-HMX were almost similar. This is because the heat of decomposition
of energetic compounds such as RDX is an intricate interplay of various
thermal processes such as melting, evaporation, and thermolysis in
gaseous and condensed phases.3,70 The heat of decomposition
of RDX can be as high as 2250 J/g and will vary depending upon the
experimental conditions as well as the nature of samples, even though
the chemical structure is same.70 In the
present study, the SM-RDX particles melt at slightly lower temperature
(205.3 °C) than bulk-sized raw-RDX particles (206.1 J/g). The
heat of melting for the SM-RDX was higher (145 J/g) than the raw-RDX
particles (113.7 J/g). The apparent heat of decomposition of RDX is
the net value of heats of thermolysis (exothermic) and evaporation
(endothermic). Thus, the observed lower heat of decomposition of SM-RDX
was due to the relative higher contribution from evaporation along
with thermolysis when compared to raw-RDX.

The present DTD
method for preparing SM particles of high energetic
particles is versatile and unique as it is one of the rarest continuous
methods for the purpose. A comparison of the various methods that
are reported in the literature for the preparation of SM particles
of RDX is given in Table T1 (the Supporting Information). The supercritical processing methods have so far achieved only
limited success in commercial application.71 The DTD method stands out because of its ability to prepare monodispersed
particles with a spherical morphology.

3 Conclusions
We have successfully prepared the SM particles of HECs through
DBD and DTD solvent–antisolvent interaction methods. It was
found that the DTD antisolvent method is suitable for the preparation
of SM-RDX and SM-HMX with controlling the size below 500 nm and spherical
morphology with uniform size distribution. A comparison of different
methods of performing solvent–antisolvent precipitation clearly
confirmed that nucleation and growth can be manipulated to control
the particle size and shape of HEC particles. Homogeneous nucleation
with arrested growth yields smaller spherical particles, whereas heterogeneous
nucleation and uncontrolled growth tends to yield larger particles.
The prepared SM-sized particles of RDX and HMX were having spherical
morphology with a mean particle size below 500 nm. However, TNT particles
were formed in different morphologies such as spherical, rod, and
dumbbell at different experimental conditions. The prepared SM-HECs
were formed in their most stable polymorphic forms. SM-RDX, SM-HMX,
and SM-TNT were in α, β, and monoclinic forms respectively.
In conclusion, the DTD reprecipitation method can be used to continuously
prepare particles of HECs having a mean particle size below 500 nm
with a spherical morphology without affecting the chemical and crystal
nature of the HECs.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Powerful HECs, RDX, HMX,
and TNT were prepared at TBRL, Chandigarh.72 Acetone was purchased from Merck India and used as received. Ultrapure
water (18.2 MΩ cm) from a double-stage water purifier (ELGA
PURELAB Option-R7) was used throughout. A syringe filter with 0.22
μm pore size was purchased from Millipore, USA. The microfluidics
experimental setup with accessories were purchased from Syrris Ltd.,
India. A magnetic stirrer with a hot plate was purchased from IKA
Pvt. Ltd., India.

4.2 Preparation of SM-HECs
Stock solutions
of HECs (50 mM) in acetone were prepared by dissolving the accurately
weighted amount of the respective HECs. Acetone was used as the solvent
because of good solubility of RDX, HMX, and TNT and good miscibility
with the antisolvent (water). Water was used as the antisolvent because
of poor solubility of HECs in it. The solutions of lower concentration
(25 and 5 mM) were prepared through dilution of the stock solution
(50 mM). The solution of HECs was always filtered before use, using
a syringe filter of pore size 0.22 μm to ensure that no particle
was present in it. Simple experimental setups of both the processes
are presented in Figure 5. The acetone solution of the HECs and the antisolvent were filled
in small glass vials (10 mL) of two different MITOS pressure pumps
and sealed them with a lid. The opening in the lid allows the liquids
to be pumped out through a fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) tube
(0.8 mm o.d. and 0.1 mm i.d.) as shown above in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Schematic experimental setup of DBD (left) and
DTD (right) solvent–antisolvent
interaction methods.

In the DBD solvent–antisolvent interaction method,
the antisolvent
(i.e., water, 25 mL) was taken in a conical flask (100 mL) and heated
on a heating plate to 70 °C while being magnetically stirred
for ensuring uniform heating. The solution of HECs was added DBD into
the hot antisolvent, using the microfluidic MITOS pressure-pump by
applying pressure (300 mb) under magnetic stirring of 1200 rpm. The
solution was added DBD continuously up to 300 s into the antisolvent
under stirring. On the contrary, in the DTD solvent–antisolvent
interaction method, the outer end of FEP tubes of both the pumps were
kept very close to each other in such a way that each drop of the
solution of HECs and antisolvent get mixed at the tube opening as
showed in Figure 5.
The two drops of solvent and antisolvent get mixed and merged into
a single droplet while dropping to the collection vessel (conical
flask, 100 mL). The particle formation takes place in the merged droplets
and can be continuously collected. The pressure of solvent and antisolvent
were 100 and 600 mb, respectively. The particles were collected by
centrifugation at 22 000 rpm. The collected samples were used
for further characterization.

4.3 Mean
Particle Size and Morphology
Primary characterization of
the mean particle size (z-average diameter, d/nm) and polydispersity index
of the precipitated particles was done using photon correlation spectroscopy
or DLS technique (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instrument Ltd., UK)
at 25 °C. The instrument had a 4 mW He–Ne laser operating
at a wavelength of 633 nm and incorporates noninvasive backscatter
optics. All measurements were made at a detection angle of 173°.
DLS measurement of samples were done using disposable polystyrene
cuvettes of 3 mL by taking the as-prepared particle suspension in
the antisolvent (water, 2 mL). Each measurement was done with an incubation
time of 120 s. Each experiment data was recorded five times, and the
mean was reported.

Accurate particle size and morphology of
the prepared particles were observed using field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI, NOVA NANOSEM 450 model). The suspension
of HEC particles in water was drop-coated on a clean silica wafer
and air-dried for 48 h. The dried sample containing silica wafer was
kept on a clean aluminum stub that is covered with carbon tape. The
sample was subsequently sputter-coated with gold at 20 mA for 2 nm
thickness before the FESEM observations. The mean particle size of
more than 300 particles from different FESEM images that were taken
from different regions of the sample was calculated in each experimental
condition using ImageJ software.

4.4 FTIR
Spectroscopy
The samples were
properly grounded with KBr powder and then pressed to obtain suitably
sized pellets for recording FTIR spectra. Pure KBr pellet was used
for background correction. FTIR spectroscopy was performed using the
Agilent Technologies Cary 660 FTIR spectrometer. FTIR spectra of raw
and processed HECs were recorded from 4000 to 500 cm–1 frequency range with a resolution of 4 cm–1 and
16 scans.

4.5 Powder XRD
The sample was placed
on a quartz sample holder and scanned in the 2θ range of 5–90°
at a scan rate of 2° min–1 with a step size
of 0.02°. The XRD measurements were performed on a SmartLab X-ray
diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation as an X-ray
source (λ = 0.15418 nm) at room temperature. The voltage and
current applied were 45 kV and 100 mA, respectively.

4.6 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)-DSC
A small amount
of the sample (2–3 mg) was taken in a standard
alumina pan with an alumina lid with a pin hole at the middle. An
empty crucible was used as the reference. Thermogravimetric Analysis
(TGA)-DSC analyses were carried out by using a NETZSCH STA 449 F1
Jupiter instrument. The samples were heated from room temperature
to 300 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 60 mL min–1 protective and 40 mL min–1 purge gases.
