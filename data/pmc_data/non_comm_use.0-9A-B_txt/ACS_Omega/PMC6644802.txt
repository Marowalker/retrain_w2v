In
the current study, we introduce photothiol-X chemistry as a
powerful method to create hydrophobic patterns covalently grafted
to the surface of cellulose paper. The general strategy builds on
the use of a cellulose-based molecular printboard featuring disulfide
functions which upon spatiocontrolled light irradiation at 365 nm
allows robust photothiol-X ligations with hydrophobic moieties. A
screening of structurally diverse molecular architectures as hydrophobic
coating was conducted, and the most impressive result obtained with
cholesterol moieties allows the creation of spatially well-resolved
hydrophobic patterns with a contact angle of 140.8°. Our discoveries
are supported by in-depth characterization studies using Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, and scanning
electron microscopy analyses.

Introduction
Cellulose is one of
the most promising renewable feedstock from
biomass with an almost inexhaustible annual bioproduction of 1011 to 1012 tons.1 Natural
fibers of cellulose possess many interesting properties such as good
mechanical strength, renewability, biodegradability and nontoxicity.
As a result, the value of cellulose is recognized for many usages,
for instance, as a raw material in wood or textile fibers or as a
pure polymer used as additive in materials, agrifood products, cosmetics,
pharmaceuticals, and so on.2,3 In addition to the use
of chemically unaltered cellulose chains, the search for new artificial
cellulose-based materials prepared by chemical modification of glucose
units is an attractive field of research.4,5 One
of the main objectives of the latter consists of either altering the
physical properties of native cellulose or preparing functional cellulose-based
materials.6,7

Cellulose-based materials have a high
tendency to water and moisture
absorption because of the high hydrophilicity of cellulose fibers.
Although the hydrophilic properties of cellulose can be of great value
for specific uses, it creates acute problems when the mechanical strength
and physical integrity of cellulose-based materials exposed to humidity
or water are altered. This issue is particularly salient with paper
materials used for packaging and printing purposes. The hydrophobization
of cellulose paper is an attractive opportunity to combine the benefits
of natural fibers with high water resistance and repellent properties.
Traditional approaches essentially focused on the hydrophobization
of cellulose paper through either noncovalent8−16 or covalent coatings,17−23 without any spatial control. Controlling hydrophobic zones on cellulose
paper through spatially controlled coatings is of much broader interest
because it allows to create hydrophobic writing,24 microfluidic devices,25 or even
platforms for parallel synthesis.26 Methods
developed for creating hydrophobic patterns on cellulose paper include
the use of wax,27 poly(dimethylsiloxane),28 methylsilesquioxane,29 plasma treatment,30 photolithography
with SU-8 photoresist,31 and Teflon.26 All of these methods involve the impregnation
of the hydrophobic patterns inside the porous structure of cellulose
paper but without chemical bonds with glucose units. By contrast,
creating more robust hydrophobic patterns covalently bound to the
cellulose surface remains a much less-explored strategy, likely because
available synthetic tools allowing a spatial control of hydrophobization
are scarce. In pioneering studies, Barner-Kowollik et al. designed
a spatially defined polymer grafting through a nitrile imine-mediated
tetrazole–ene cycloaddition mediated by UV light.32 Rojas, Levkin et al. reported spatially controlled
thiol–ene33 and thiol–yne34 functionalization of nanocellulose films and
paper with fluorinated alkyl chains. Although very high water contact
angles were reached, up to 166°, the reactive film grafted with
alkene or alkynes functions displayed an inherent hydrophobicity (up
to 126°) prior to the patterning step, requiring further modifications
to create distinct hydrophobic/hydrophilic zones.

In the frame-a-program
devoted to the discovery of functional cellulose
papers,35−38 we recently created a paper-based molecular printboard for spatiotemporal
writing through photothiol-X ligations of either UV active or colored
inks upon light irradiation.39 This powerful
strategy displays a number of salient features such as a (i) facile
ligation following the principles of click chemistry, (ii) spatiotemporal
control, (iii) high molecular modularity, and (iv) whiteness preservation
in nonpatterned regions. The objective of our current work is to demonstrate
that the photothiol-X ligation strategy is a powerful approach for
creating covalent hydrophobic patterns onto the surface of cellulose
paper.

Results and Discussion
The UV-mediated thiol-X ligation
strategy stands on the use of
a photoresponsive cellulose paper covalently grafted with dithiodiglycolic
acid 1 (Cell-DiS). The disulfide bond is
subjected to a homolytic cleavage into the corresponding thiyl radical
upon light irradiation at 365 nm in the presence of 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone
(DMPA) as a radical initiator. In a recent report, we discussed in-depth
the benefits of using disulfide compounds as thiyl radical precursors
instead of usual thiol functions because of the lower bond dissociation
energy.18 In our previous studies, Cell-DiS was prepared by esterification of the pristine paper
with dithiodiglycolic acid 1, using p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) as a catalyst in refluxing toluene.
However, we experienced difficulties for preserving the whiteness
of Cell-DiS on the whole surface because crystals of
PTSA, weakly soluble in toluene, were frequently adsorbed in the porous
network of cellulose, staining the paper with brown marks. Therefore,
we reinvestigated the esterification step with 1 following
a careful multivariable optimization. The reaction efficiency was
followed by elemental analysis, and background reactions were systematically
performed without catalyst to confirm the absence of residual adsorbed
diacid 1 (Table 1). We confirmed that PTSA was responsible for the brown marks
frequently observed on Cell-DiS because an increase of
PTSA loading from 0.1 to 0.2 equivalent exacerbated the staining (entries
2 vs 3), whereas a further increase to 0.5 equivalent completely burnt
the paper (entry 4). Unfortunately, reducing the loading of PTSA to
0.05 equivalent indeed preserved the whiteness, but the esterification
efficiency was significantly altered because the degree of substitution
(DS) dropped to 8% (entry 1). Switching PTSA for camphorsulfonic acid
(CSA) did not improve the process because brown marks were again occasionally
observed on the paper surface (entry 5). Because the brown marks frequently
observed on Cell-DiS results from the low solubility
of PTSA and CSA in toluene leading to an inhomogeneous dispersion,
we envisaged the use of BF3·Et2O as a liquid
acid catalyst. With 0.1 equivalent of BF3·Et2O, the grafting of dithiodiglycolic acid 1 reached 16%
after 17 h of stirring and 17% after 24 h, without any staining issues
(entries 6–7). We were unable to improve the process because
higher loading of BF3·Et2O significantly
altered the paper whiteness (entry 8). Further variations of both
the loading of compound 1 and the reaction temperature
did not allow to improve the DS (entries 9–11).

In summary, the
esterification of dithiodiglycolic acid was best
performed with BF3·Et2O as Lewis acid catalyst
under refluxing toluene. The DS of 17% indicates that almost two hydroxyl
groups were functionalized every 10 glucose units. This level of grafting
appears to be the best compromise to allow further functionalization
without compromising both the physical integrity and the native hydrophilicity
of cellulose paper.

We complemented the characterization of Cell-DiS through
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron
spectrometry (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The creation
of the ester linkage is evidenced on the FTIR spectrum by a new band
at 1725 cm–1; the remaining bands between 400 and
1500 cm–1 are typical of the digital finger print
of the cellulose backbone and could not be distinguished from pristine
cellulose (Figure 1a, see also Figure S1 in the Supporting Information for pristine cellulose). The integrity of disulfide functions can
be verified by XPS through examination of the S 2p spectrum (Figure 1b, see also Figure
S4 in the Supporting Information for pristine
cellulose). The two spin orbit peaks observed at 164.8 and 163.6 eV
for S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively, corresponding
to a spin-orbit splitting of 1.2 eV, are characteristic of disulfide
functions. Last but not least, both the acidic conditions induced
by the use of BF3·Et2O, and the chemical
grafting of dithiodiglycolic acid does not affect the morphology of
the cellulose fibers, as evidenced by SEM analysis (Figure 1c, see also Figure S5 in the Supporting Information for pristine cellulose).

spectrum, (b) high-resolution S 2p XPS spectrum, and (c)
SEM image of Cell-DiS.

Having an optimized procedure to prepare Cell-DiS in
reliable conditions, we then turned our attention to the challenging
hydrophobic patterning of cellulose paper (Figure 2a). The experimental setup regarding the
patterning consists of the use of Cell-DiS inserted in
a sample holder consisting of two aluminum plates; the top plate is
drilled on a diameter of 6 mm to draw a circular pattern on Cell-DiS. The sample holder is immersed in a solution containing
the hydrophobic compound to be grafted and DMPA as radical initiator
under light irradiation at 365 nm. This experimental procedure was
first optimized on a benchmark process involving the use of norbornene
as a hydrophobic moiety through a photothiol–ene ligation.
The success of the hydrophobic patterning was initially assessed through
the measure of the water contact angle. The nature of the solvent
proved to be crucial for the success of the patterning because traditional
solvents used in free-radical chemistry gave unsatisfactory results.
For instance, erratic results and irregular patterns were observed
when the benchmark patterning was carried out in dimethyl sulfoxide,
whereas the use of CH3CN as a solvent did not generate
any pattern onto the surface of Cell-DiS. In this framework,
we discovered that ethyl hexanoate, an innocuous solvent widely used
as olfactory compound in fragrance and food, was very effective to
pattern Cell-DiS with norbornene, giving rise Cell-Norb with an excellent water contact angle of 125.3 ± 1.4°
(see an image of a water droplet in Figure 2b). A detailed literature survey revealed
that the use of ethyl hexanoate is unprecedented for conducting thiol-X
reactions, and our results suggested that it could be a powerful solvent
surrogate in free-radical chemistry. To diversify the chemical nature
of the hydrophobic pattern, we also evaluated the photothiol–yne
ligation of the cholesterol derivative 3. We measured
an outstanding water contact angle of 140.8 ± 1.1° for the
corresponding material Cell-Chol (see an image of a water
droplet in Figure 2c). We stress that both pristine paper and Cell-DiS instantaneously
absorbed water droplets and displayed a water contact angle of 0°.
Upon immersion of Cell-Chol in water, the circular pattern
was revealed in deep white, whereas the nonpatterned area was slightly
stained by the moisture (see picture in Figure 2c). A droplet of water deposited onto the
hydrophobic area permanently remained at the surface, in the limit
of its evaporation (ca. 1 h at 25 °C), whereas the nonpatterned
area retained the native hydrophilicity of pristine cellulose paper.

Surface characterization
of both Cell-Norb and Cell-Chol through
XPS shows a sharp increase of the C(sp3) component of the
C 1s spectra with respect to Cell-DiS (Figure 2d–f).
By contrast, the huge contribution of vibration modes from the cellulose
backbone precludes any accurate analysis of the grafting process by
FTIR because the digital fingerprints of both Cell-Norb and Cell-Chol were not discernible from that of Cell-DiS (Figures S2–S3, see the Supporting Information). The only, but not less important,
information extracted from the FTIR spectra is related to the carbonyl
band intensity which was not modified, confirming that the ester linkage
was not damaged by the photothiol-X ligation. The very regular shape
of the pattern associated to its high hydrophobicity validate the
photothiol-X strategy as a very competitive technology for producing
robust spatially controlled hydrophobic area onto the surface of cellulose
paper in a straightforward way and without any specific equipment
such as a plasma reactor or dedicated printer.

General Procedure
for the Pretreatment of Cellulose Paper
One piece of commercially
available cellulose filter paper was
mercerized following our previously reported procedure.39

Synthesis of Dithiodiglycolic Acid (1)
Dithiodiglycolic acid 1 was prepared,
following our
recently described procedure.39

Preparation
of Cell-DiS
A piece of mercerized
cellulose paper (approx. 140 mg, 0.86 mmol) in dry toluene (40 mL)
was treated with a solution of BF3·Et2O
(11 μL, 0.086 mmol) in toluene (11 mL), and the resulting mixture
was stirred for 5 min. Freshly prepared dithiodiglycolic acid (3 equiv
per glucose unit) was added in one portion, and the mixture was stirred
for 24 h at 110 °C under nitrogen atmosphere, protected from
light. Cell-DiS was washed with EtOH, MeOH, acetone,
and dichloromethane (DCM) under sonication, dried, and stored in the
dark under nitrogen.

Synthesis of 3-(Prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)cholester
(3)
Cholesterol derivative 3 was
prepared following our
recently published procedure.40

Preparation
of Cell-Norb
A mixture of
norbornene 2 (100 mg, 1.062 mmol) and DMPA (40 mg, 0.16
mmol) in ethyl hexanoate (6 mL) was added in a glasstank. Then, 12
mg of Cell-DiS was wedged between one photomask and an
aluminum plate (2 × 2.5 cm), immersed in the solution and irradiated
with a UV light (λmax = 365 nm) during 150 min with
vigorous stirring. Finally, Cell-Norb was sequentially
washed with EtOH, MeOH, acetone, and DCM under sonication, dried under
vacuum, and stored under nitrogen.

Preparation of Cell-Chol
A mixture of
3-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)cholesterol 3 (451 mg, 1.062 mmol)
and DMPA (40 mg, 0.16 mmol) in ethyl hexanoate (6 mL) was added in
a glass tank. Then, 12 mg of Cell-DiS was wedged between
one photomask and an aluminum plate (2 × 2.5 cm), immersed in
the solution and irradiated with a UV light (λmax = 365 nm) for 150 min with vigorous stirring. Finally, Cell-Chol was sequentially washed with EtOH, MeOH, acetone, and DCM under
sonication, dried under vacuum, and stored under nitrogen.

Conclusions
In summary, we established a photoresponsive cellulose paper as
a powerful molecular platform which can be functionalized by covalently
grafted hydrophobic patterns. The light-mediated thiol-X ligation
is the key technology of our approach as it allows to produce well-defined
hydrophobic patterns in mild conditions. For instance, the ligation
of cholesterol units through a thiol–yne reaction produces
patterns of high hydrophobicity with an outstanding water contact
angle of 140.8°. We believe that this established thiol-X technology
has a great potential for the creation of robust microfluidic devices
with spatially resolved hydrophobic area. Our team is currently working
on the creation of complex microfluidic devices for offsite diagnosis.
