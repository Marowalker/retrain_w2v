In this study, we demonstrated that 19F NMR can be used
to study the thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA) DNA G-quadruplex, widely
used as a model structure for studying G-quadruplex aptamers. We systematically
examined the structural feature of the TBA G-quadruplex aptamer with
fluorine-19 (19F) labels at all of the thymidine positions.
We successfully observed the structural change between the G-quadruplex
and the unstructured single strand by 19F NMR spectroscopy.
The thermodynamic parameters of these DNA G-quadruplex aptamers were
also determined from the 19F NMR signals. We further showed
that the 19F NMR method can be used to observe the complex
formed by TBA G-quadruplex and thrombin. Our results suggest that 19F NMR spectroscopy is a useful approach to study the aptamer
G-quadruplex structure.

Introduction
G-quadruplexes are
four-stranded DNA or RNA structures consisting
of G-tetrads formed by four guanines via Hoogsteen base pairing. Recent
studies have shown that DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes are related to
human disease and cancer.1 For instance,
we have demonstrated that the higher-order DNA G-quadruplex structure
in telomeric-overhang DNA protects against degradation by double-strand
breaks and nuclease hydrolysis.2

Recently, G-quadruplex structures are suggested as targets for
drug development based on their biological activities including gene
regulation, telomere maintenance, transcription, and DNA replication.3−9 We found that human telomere RNA forms G-quadruplex structures.10−13 Recently, we demonstrated that a RNA telomere G-quadruplex binds
to hnRNPA1, a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1,
and plays an important role in telomere end protection.14 These reports suggested that the G-quadruplex
structure has a significant biological function for various events
in vivo. Thus, studies of physicochemical properties and structural
characteristics of G-quadruplex structures will lead to a better understanding
of the biological functions of G-quadruplexes.

G-quadruplex
aptamers obtained using the in vitro selection technique
have been reported against a wide variety of targets as aptamer-based
therapeutics and diagnostics.15 It is especially
known that a thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA) is a well-characterized
aptamer in the sense of structure and stability,16−19 acting as an anticoagulant agent
inhibiting the activation of fibrinogen as well as platelet aggregation
induced by thrombin. The structure of a TBA is a chairlike and antiparallel
G-quadruplex structure that consists of two G-quartets connected by
two TT loops and a single TGT loop (Figure 1a).20 Here, we
used 19F NMR to examine the structural feature of a TBA
G-quadruplex aptamer. 19F NMR was used to evaluate significant
conformations of nucleic acids. 19F is an ideal conformational
probe because of its highly sensitive and low background signals in
biological samples.21−35 We have recently reported the application of 19F NMR
spectroscopy for characterizing RNA G-quadruplex conformations.36 We have also successfully used 19F NMR spectroscopy to study the interactions between RNA G-quadruplexes
and ligand molecules and proteins.37

2′-deoxyuridine having 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group.

Here, we systematically labeled
the TBA G-quadruplex with 19F-labeled nucleotide at each
one of the thymidine positions
and successfully examined the structural feature of the aptamer by 19F NMR (Figure 1b). The thermodynamic parameters of the DNA G-quadruplex aptamers
were determined. The 19F NMR method was also used to study
the interactions of TBA G-quadruplex and thrombin complex.

Results
and Discussion
To prepare the required 19F-labeling,
5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine
was reacted with 1-ethynyl-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene by Sonogashira
coupling (Scheme S1 and Figures S1–S9). We first investigated the conformation of the 19F-labeled
oligonucleotides by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The CD spectra
of with and without 19F-labeled TBA oligonucleotides in
the presence of 100 mM potassium ions have positive and negative peaks
at 295 and 265 nm, respectively, which are characteristic of an antiparallel
chairlike G-quadruplex structure in agreement with previous reports.38 This indicates that the incorporation of the 19F-labeled nucleoside in the loop region does not affect the
folding of the G-quadruplex (Figure S10).

We next investigated the structural behavior of oligonucleotides
using 19F NMR spectroscopy. TBA DNA G-quadruplex as a model
structure has been well studied. In particular, Galeone et al. have
suggested that the minor loops TT are involved in the interaction
with the thrombin.19 To test the influence
of T on TBA aptamer by 19F NMR in detail, we label TBA
at all T positions. Figure 2a shows the 19F NMR spectra of all 19F-labeled oligonucleotides (T3, T4, T7, T9, T12, and T13) in the
presence or absence of potassium ions. It can be clearly observed
that the new peaks appear with the addition of 100 mM KCl compared
with 0 mM KCl for all of the oligonucleotides. The results suggested
that the corresponding resonances of the DNA structures can be used
to distinguish the DNA structures of G-quadruplexes. For instance,
for 19F-labeled TBA oligonucleotide (T12) in the absence
of potassium ions, the single-stranded T12 indicated a single peak
at −62.88 ppm, whereas in the presence of 100 mM potassium
ions, a new peak of G-quadruplex at −62.57 ppm appeared and
the original peak of the single strand (−62.88 ppm) disappeared.
When the temperature was increased to 70 °C, the G-quadruplex
peaks disappeared, and only the single-strand peak (−62.88
ppm) was detected in the 19F NMR spectrum (Figure 2b). To further confirm that
signal at −62.88 was from the G-quadruplex, we performed a 1H NMR experiment by the observation of imino protons from
the G-quadruplex (Figure 2b). Eight peaks of the TBA G-quadruplex were found at 11.5–12.5
ppm corresponding to the single peak in the 19F NMR spectrum.
At the denaturing temperature (70 °C), no peak was observed in
the 1H NMR. In accordance with the 19F NMR spectrum,
we only observed the peak of the unstructured single strand. We observed
that the label of 19F showed different positions and degree
of chemical shift. The structural environment of the 19F-label strongly influences the 19F NMR signals. Thus,
the 19F at different positions of TBA aptamer may result
in the corresponding resonances. Therefore, these results suggest
that the 19F NMR method can strictly discriminate the G-quadruplex
structure. NMR signals depend on whether the molecule of interest
is freely available for tumbling in a solution.39,40 In general, molecules display big tumbling rates due to their random
coil and increase in temperature, leading to an overall increase in
the tumbling rates and, consequently, a degree of chemical shift of 19F NMR.

[KCl] = 100 mM, [Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.0)] = 10 mM. (b) 1H imino proton NMR of T12 corresponding to 19F
NMR at 25 or 70 °C.

We next performed a temperature-dependent experiment to confirm
the assignment of the two signals in the 19F NMR (Figure 3a). When the temperature
was increased from 30 to 65 °C, the intensity of the signals
for the G-quadruplex decreased (red circle for T3, T4, T7, T9, T12,
and T13), whereas that of the signals for the single-strand DNA increased
(blue circle). The result indicated the conversion of the G-quadruplex
to the single-strand DNA at higher temperatures. When heated to approximately
60 °C, only the peaks of the single strand showed a strong intensity,
whereas the G-quadruplex peaks completely disappeared. This result
indicated that all of the G-quadruplexes unfolded to a single strand
at high temperatures.

oligonucleotides
at different temperatures. Blue and red spots indicated single strand
and G-quadruplex. Temperatures indicated on the right. (b) Melting
profiles derived from the relative peak areas of the 19F signals on different temperatures.

Because the 19F NMR spectroscopy can monitor the
conformational
transition of the DNA aptamer, we further characterized the melting
process using the 19F signals at various temperatures (Figure 3b). According to
the melting curves estimated from the 19F NMR peak areas,
T9 was more stable than other G-quadruplexes. The quantitative characterization
of the thermodynamics of the process can be easily performed by the
resonances of different conformations (Table 1 and Figure S11). The enthalpy change (ΔH) indicates that
the stability of G-quadruplex is an enthalpic definition (ΔH = −192.6 kJ/mol for T9), suggesting large enthalpic
contributions to the stability of the G-quadruplex.

±10 J/(mol K).

Inspection
of the molecular model of T9 suggests that the 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl
group is located near the G8 residue of the TGT loop (Figure 4a), which provokes a substantial
decrease in the distance between fluorine and H8 and H2′ of
G8. The F–H8 and F–H2′ distances were approximately
2.4 and 1.9 Å, respectively (Figure 4b). The close F–H8 and F–H2′
contacts are indicative of a pseudo-hydrogen-bond of F–H8 and
F–H2′, such as those found in the G-quadruplex containing
2′F–G residue.41 Therefore,
the enhanced stability of T9 may be due to the F–H8 and F–H2′
interactions via pseudo-hydrogen-bonds, both of which are lacking
in the other G-quadruplexes.

by T9. (b) Distances
between F–H8 and F–H2′ in T9. dG and 19F-labeled 2′-deoxyuridine are indicated in magenta and yellow,
respectively. 19F is light blue.

We further investigated the interaction of G-quadruplex aptamer
with thrombin and inhibitory activity. As shown in Figure S12, following the addition of thrombin to the G-quadruplex
aptamer sample, a new signal was detected in the 19F NMR
spectrum. The signal was attributed to the complex between the G-quadruplex
aptamer and thrombin, suggesting that 19F NMR spectroscopy
is a useful tool for studying the binding events of G-quadruplex aptamer
and protein targets. To test the inhibitory activity of 19F-labeled TBA oligonucleotides, we measured the prothrombin times
of T4 and T9. To compare the influence of 19F-labeled T
on inhibition, we selected the T9 with chemical modification at the
central TGT loop and the T4 at the lateral TT loop. The T9 with a
higher stability is expected to present an inhibitory activity, in
which T4 is used as a control. The T9 oligonucleotide showed adequate
inhibitory activity in plasma clotting as compared to T4 and the untreated
condition (Figure S13).

Conclusions
We demonstrated that 19F NMR spectroscopy can be used
to effectively analyze the G-quadruplex aptamer structure. On the
basis of the 19F NMR signals, we quantitatively determined Tm and thermodynamic parameters of a G-quadruplex
aptamer. Furthermore, observation of 19F NMR chemical shift
changes was also shown to be a useful approach for monitoring the
interactions of G-quadruplex aptamer and protein target.

Experimental
Section
DNA Synthesis and Purification
All of the DNAs were
synthesized on the 1.0 μmol scale with an NTS DNA/RNA synthesizer
(Nihon Techno Service Co., Ltd.), using the solid-phase phosphoramidite
chemistry. After automated synthesis, the oligonucleotides were detached
from the support and deprotected according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. All of the oligonucleotides were purified by RP-HPLC (JASCO)
using an appropriate linear gradient of 50 mM ammonium formate in
H2O and 50 mM ammonium formate in 1:1 acetonitrile/H2O. The fractions containing the product were collected and
lyophilized to give purified oligonucleotides. The purified oligonucleotides
were desalted by NAP5 columns (GE Healthcare) and identified by a
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometer
(MALDI-TOF MS) (negative mode).

MALDI-TOF MS
The
matrix for MALDI-TOF MS was 1:1 mixture
of 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (3HPA) in 1:1 acetonitrile/H2O saturated solution and 0.5 M ammonium citrate aqueous solution.
1 μL of DNA sample was mixed with 1 μL of matrix solution.
A spot of 1 μL of the sample–matrix mixture was placed
on a MALDI target plate (MTP 384 ground steel, Bruker) and allowed
to air dry at room temperature. The spectrum was measured using a
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometer
(MALDI-TOF MS) on Bruker autoflex II mass spectrometer (negative mode)
with dT8 ([M – H]−: 2370.603)
and dT17 ([M – H]−: 5108.376)
as an external calibration standard.

CD Measurements and Analysis
of CD Melting Profile
CD spectra were measured using a JASCO
J-820 CD spectrophotometer.
The spectra were recorded using a 1 cm path length cell. Samples were
prepared by heating the oligonucleotides at 95 °C for 5 min and
gradually cooling them to room temperature. The melting curves were
obtained by monitoring 295 nm. Solutions for CD spectra were prepared
as 0.3 mL samples at 5 μM strand concentration in the presence
of 100 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.0).

19F NMR Experiments
NMR experiments were
performed on a Bruker AV-400M spectrometer. Trifluoroacetic acid as
an external standard (−75.66 ppm) was used. The NMR experiment
with DNA G-quadruplex (100 μM) was performed in 10 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.0), 100 mM KCl containing 10% (v/v) D2O.

Prothrombin
Time Measurement
Prothrombin times were
measured by using Thrombotrack (Sanko Junyaku Co., Ltd.). Human plasma
(100 μL) and 3 μL of oligonucleotides (T4 and T9) were
incubated at 37 °C for 1 min at 0.25, 0.5, and 1 μM final
concentrations. Then, 200 μL of thromboplastin reagent (tissue
factors) was added. The prothrombin time measurement was performed
in triplicate, and the average value was calculated.

Molecular Modeling
The initial model of 19F-labeled TBA (T9) was generated
from the NMR solution structure
of the d(GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG) (PDB code 148D) using the BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2016
(Accelrys). The molecular dynamics simulation was performed by the
CHARMm program in BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2016.
