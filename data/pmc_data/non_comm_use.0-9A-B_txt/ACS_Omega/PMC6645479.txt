Ethyl diazoacetate (EDA) commonly
experiences intensive decomposition
as well as complex conversion concerning safety and efficiency. In
this work, a careful kinetics study on the thermal decomposition of
EDA was isothermally conducted in a microtube reactor to establish
a mechanism-based kinetic model. The model parameters were well calibrated
with experimental data including the yield of dimmers and the conversion
of EDA, confirming the rationality of the proposed three-step reaction
route. It allows the model to concisely describe the complex species
transformations during EDA decomposition, which is unavailable for
an apparent kinetic model. Considering an isothermal reaction system
and the tolerance of EDA consumption by thermal decomposition, this
work could help reveal the requirement on the kinetic characteristics
of the desired catalytic reaction in which EDA is involved, as a reference
on reaction process modeling and regulation.

Introduction
Ethyl
diazoacetate (EDA) is a highly welcomed chemical reagent
with significance as the precursor of the carbene to synthesize some
key intermediates of pesticides.1−9 For instance, EDA can conduct aldol-type condensation with aldehyde
or react with ketone to obtain α-diazo-β-hydroxy esters10−17 and can provide α-carbonyl carbenes to undergo O–H
or C–H insertion to π-bonds to form ylides;18−20 similar to the report on the polymerization of allyl diazoacetate
by Liu et al.,21 the carbene polymerization
with α-carbonyl diazo compounds as carbene precursor has attracted
much attention recently.22,23 It is noticed that
all of these reactions involve the decomposition of EDA to generate
carbenes (eq 1) and the
carbenes could combine various transition metals to form metal carbenes
as active catalytic intermediates.24 Therefore,
the kinetics of EDA decomposition has been the main concern. It is
usually described and discussed with the apparent kinetics expression
as shown in eq 2. Both
first-order reaction kinetics and zero-order reaction kinetics have
ever been reported for the order of EDA (y),25,26 and a consensus has not been reached until now. It indicates that
EDA experiences reaction steps more complicated than what eq 1 shows. Recognizing and
quantitatively modeling these reaction steps are desired to regulate
the conversions that EDA participates in. To this end, experimental
data corresponding to strictly controlled reaction conditions and
residence time are required, which are difficult to obtain in a conventional
stirred reactor because the decomposition of EDA seems to be fast
and highly exothermic.27 1   2  The microtube reactor
with the characteristic
dimension less than 1 mm is a device that could transfer the reaction
time into reaction pipeline volume precisely, so it has precise control
ability for reaction time.28−30 This property makes the microtube
reactors especially appropriate for handling the reactions involving
active reactants, products, or intermediates with a short lifetime
under reaction conditions.31−34 Besides, the microtube reactors have enhanced heat
transfer performance to inhibit the formation of hot spot effectively.35−37 By now, microtube reactors have been successfully used to measure
the kinetics of different reactions in gas phase,38 liquid phase,39 and heterogeneous
catalytic system.40

In this work,
we carried out kinetic measurements on the thermal
decomposition of EDA using microtube reactor by monitoring the concentrations
of EDA and main products at various residence times and established
a quantitative model considering simplified multistep reaction mechanism
based on a comprehensive experiment data regression. And then, this
kinetic model was used to predict the details of EDA consumption during
thermal decomposition process and discuss the prerequisite in terms
of kinetics for an effective catalytic organic synthesis involving
EDA.

Results and Discussion
Data Acquisition and Process Analysis
Residence
Time
Because the decomposition of EDA could
release nitrogen, the residence time is not only determined by the
volume of tube and the feed flow rate, but it is also dependent on
the volume ratio of nitrogen gas to liquid (ratiog/l) throughout
the tube. Using difference method, the local value of ratiog/l at the end point of the ith section of the tube
can be calculated as follows. 3  where ΔCEDA is the difference in the EDA concentration
until this specific position, R is the thermodynamic
constant (8.314 J/(mol K)), and P is the pressure.
As the tube is divided into j sections, the average
value of ratiog/l in the tube is 4  and, the residence time (t) is 5  where F is the feed flow
rate and V is the volume of the tube.

Conversion
of EDA
The time profiles of the EDA conversion
under specific initial EDA concentration (CEDA,0) and temperature were determined in a thermostat microflow system
and then plotted in Figure 1 (black dots and black lines). In Figure 1a–c,e, different curves correspond
to different temperatures, from 393 to 423 K, but CEDA,0 was always kept at 0.023 mol/L. The conversion of
EDA accelerates distinctly with increasing temperature. To reach 50%
EDA conversion, it takes 35 min at 393 K and 3 min at 423 K. Figure 1d,f corresponding
to CEDA,0 = 0.046 mol/L show the same
phenomenon. Comparing the curves in the figures obtained at the same
temperature, for example, Figures 1c,d and 2e,f, we could find
changing CEDA,0 only has little influence
on the curve of EDA conversion vs residence time. This characteristic
is similar with the first-order reaction kinetics to some extent.

Figure 1 Time profiles
of EDA conversion and dimmers yield: (a) CEDA,0 = 0.023 mol/L, T = 393
K; (b) CEDA,0 = 0.023 mol/L, T = 403 K; (c) CEDA,0 = 0.023 mol/L, T = 413 K; (d) CEDA,0 = 0.046
mol/L, T = 413 K; (e) CEDA,0 = 0.023 mol/L, T = 423 K; and (f) CEDA,0 = 0.046 mol/L, T = 423 K.

constants.

Yield of Dimmers
Researchers have found that the decomposition
of EDA could generate various products, of which two cis–trans
isomers, diethyl fumarate (DEF) and diethyl maleate (DEM), are confirmed
species.43 Both of them are so-called dimmers
because they could be regarded as the dimer of carbenes. It is generally
agreed that carbene species are key intermediates in alkene formation
via dimerization of diazo reagents.44 A
polymer of ethoxycarbonylcarbene could form presumably by repeated
reaction of the carbene with itself or with ethyl diazoacetate, and
the bulk of the carbine–carbene or carbene–diazoacetate
reactions occurs in the α-position.45 In this work, we determined the concentration of DEF and DEM separately
and took the sum as the concentration of dimmers. The yield of dimmers
is denoted as the ratio of dimmers concentration to 0.5CEDA,0. We monitored the time profiles of dimmers yield
with residence time, and the results were summarized in Figure 1 (red dots and red lines).
As seen, for all of the cases, the yield of dimmers reaches a peak
value soon and decreases smoothly. It implies that the dimmers could
transform to other products sequentially. Either DEF or DEM includes
a reactive double bond. They could react with carbenes to yield trimmers
with a double bond or a three-member ring, and also could react with
EDA to yield pyrazoline.46−48 Besides, we noticed that at the
same CEDA,0, the peak value of dimmers
yield increased with increasing temperature. It indicates that the
reaction-generating dimmers have higher temperature sensitivity compared
with the reaction-consuming dimmers, i.e., the former have a higher
activation energy. Comparing Figure 1c,d and 1e,f, at the same temperature
shows that CEDA,0 has little influence
on the curve of dimer yield vs residence time.

Reaction
Mechanism
As mentioned above, the thermal
decomposition of EDA involves various reactive species including EDA,
carbene, and dimmers, so the actual reaction network may be quite
complex. However, considering that the order of reactivity is well
known as carbene ≫ EDA > dimmers and EDA surpasses carbenes
and dimmers overwhelmed in amount usually, it is plausible to propose
a simplified reaction network as shown in Scheme 1. Three-step reactions are included. Step
1: one EDA molecular decomposes to generate one carbene and release
nitrogen, of which the reaction rate parameter is k1. Step 2: one carbene reacts with one EDA molecular to
generate one dimer molecular and release nitrogen, of which the reaction
rate parameter is k2. The reaction between
two carbenes is neglected because EDA is much more than carbene in
the system. Step 3: one dimer reacts with one carbene to generate
one trimer molecular, of which the reaction rate parameter is k3. Herein, we neglected (1) the EDA-involved
dimer consumption reaction in the absence of highly reactive intermediate
like carbene, (2) the difference of DEM and DEF in reaction performance,
and (3) any reaction step that trimer or larger oligomer participates
in.

Scheme 1 Proposed Simplified Reaction Network
Modeling Reaction Kinetics and Species Evolution
Based
on the reaction network, we can establish mathematical equations to
describe the reaction kinetics, as shown in eqs 6 to 8. 6   7   8  where CEDA is
the concentration of EDA, Ccb is the concentration
of carbene, Cdm is the concentration of
dimmers, and Ctm is the concentration
of trimmers. Due to the high reactivity of carbene, most of the carbenes
will be consumed immediately after the generation, and the concentration
of carbene is low and varies little. Supposing that the concentration
of carbine complies with quasi-steady-state assumption, we could get eq 9 9  Substituting eq 9 into eqs 6 and 8, we could get eqs 10 and 11 10   11  Thus, as the kinetic parameters (k1 and k3/k2) and the initial conditions (CEDA,0 and T) were given, CEDA, Ccb, Cdm, and Ctm could be calculated
out from eqs 10 and 11. At the same time, using microtube reactor platform,
the concentration of EDA and dimmers corresponding to specific residence
time could be determined experimentally. We established an objective
function described as eq 12 to evaluate the deviation between the calculated values and
the experimental values, where a weight factor of 100 was set for
the yield of dimmers to consider the EDA conversion and the yield
of dimmers comparably. Furthermore, the MATLAB programming code was
written, and the Nelder–Mead simplex optimization method was
used to search the optimized kinetic parameters k1 and k3/k2. The optimization algorithm is depicted in Figure 2. 12  And then, the reaction rate constants k1 and k3/k2 under four different experiment temperatures
were obtained. On the other hand, using these parameters, the curves
of reaction conversion and dimmers yield under specific initial conditions
could be figured out. The deviation between the calculated curves
and the experimental dots are shown in Figure 1. Moreover, we supposed that the dependence
of the reaction rate constant on temperature agrees with Arrhenius
formula. And then, from the reaction rate constants under different
temperatures, the parameters in Arrhenius formula could be obtained
by fitting (Figure 3). The calibration equations were listed as follows. The activation
energy for the EDA decomposition reaction to generate carbene is 114.55
kJ/mol. The difference in activation energy between dimmers-generating
and -consuming reactions is 9.96 kJ/mol. 13   14  Due to the high reactivity of carbene, the
contact of two carbenes may conduct self-polymerization to form dimmers
instantaneously. However, the quite a low concentration of carbene
determines that the self-polymerization is a mass-transfer controlled
process. As is well known, compared with the reaction rate, the mass
transfer rate is usually far less sensitive to temperature. A 10 °C
temperature increase may cause the reaction rate to double, whereas
the mass transfer rate increases 5% or less. Equation 14 shows that the two steps, dimmers generation
and consumption, have small difference in terms of activation energy.
It implies that none of them is of mass transfer controlled process.
In other words, it is rational to ignore the contribution of the self-polymerization
of carbene to dimmers generation.

Figure 3 Fitting reaction rate constants under
various temperatures with
Arrhenius formula.

Substituting eqs 13 and 14 into eqs 10 and 11, and setting CEDA,0 and T, the time profiles
of CEDA, Ccb, and Cdimmers could be calculated by
numerical integration. Figure 4a shows the results when CEDA,0 = 0.023 mol/L and T = 393 K. As seen, the concentration
of dimmers experiences a fast rise initially and a slow fall afterward.
The peak value of Cdimmers is about 0.00042
mol/L at 7.4 min. Most of EDA is eventually converted to trimmers.
Using the above equations and calibrations, we could also discuss
the conversion rate of EDA and the contribution of specific reaction
step on it, as shown Figure 4b. Both decomposition of EDA to generate carbene and the reaction
of EDA with carbene to generate dimmers, denoted as step 1 and step
2, respectively, consistently decelerate with time. The reaction of
EDA with dimmers to generate trimmers, denoted as step 3, accelerates
first and then decelerates, influenced by the dimmers’ concentration.
A maximal rate of step 3 is achieved at around 3.7 min. The existence
of carbene in the reaction system could promote the conversion of
EDA. The total conversion rate of EDA is the sum of the rates of step
1 and step 2. One half to 1/3 of EDA is converted in the thermal decomposition
of EDA in step 2. So, it is not appropriate to describe the conversion
of EDA by a simple first-order reaction kinetic model. Because the
carbenes participate in the conversion of EDA, we should properly
consider various reactions that consume carbene and change the concentration
of carbene to regulate the conversion of EDA.

Figure 4 Time dependence of (a)
the concentrations of various species and
(b) the rates of various reactions consuming EDA. CEDA,0 = 0.023 mol/L, T = 393 K.

Once the reaction between EDA
and another reactant is the desired
reaction, such as the cyclopropanation reaction between EDA and olefins,
to achieve high selectivity requires that the desired reaction is
much faster than the thermal decomposition of EDA. Considering an
isothermal reaction system and the tolerance of EDA consumption by
thermal decomposition, we can figure out a reaction window in terms
of the initiation concentration of EDA, temperature, and reaction
time. As the initial concentration of EDA is fixed, there will exist
correspondence between the range of EDA thermal decomposition ratio
and the scope that temperature and reaction time cover. Figure 5 shows an example, in which CEDA,0 = 0.02 mol/L. As seen, to reach 10% EDA
thermal decomposition ratio, we need 1.6 min at 130 °C, and 25
min at 100 °C, and all of the combinations of temperature and
reaction time are located on the boundary between two regions of different
colors. If the desired reaction could deplete EDA under the reaction
conditions in the region encircled by the boundary and two coordinate
axes, we may expect a selectivity of over 90%. In other words, the
simplified mechanism-based model for the thermal decomposition of
EDA in organic solvent can provide a reference to model and regulate
the EDA-involved catalytic organic synthesis.

Conclusions
In
summary, we established a measuring platform based on microtube
reactor in thermostat to acquire the kinetic data for the thermal
decomposition of ethyl diazoacetate (EDA) in organic solvent (1,2-dichloroethane)
systematically. By analyzing the time profiles of the concentrations
of EDA and dimmers (diethyl fumarate and diethyl maleate, as confirmed
products) according to the reaction mechanism, we proposed a simplified
three-step reaction kinetic model, including the decomposition of
EDA to generate carbene, the reaction between carbene and EDA to generate
dimmers, and the reaction between carbene and dimer to generate trimer.
The parameters in kinetic equations to describe these reaction steps
were obtained by calibration. Using these parameters and equations
group, we could calculate the conversion of EDA and the yield of dimmers
accurately and predict the contribution of carbene to the conversion
of EDA. Furthermore, the reaction time/temperature dependence of EDA
thermal decomposition ratio was discussed to understand the requirement
on the kinetic characteristics of the desired reaction involving EDA.
The simplified and quantitative mechanism-based model for the thermal
decomposition of EDA in organic solvent has foundation in modeling
and regulating various EDA-involving catalytic organic syntheses that
are currently conducted by our group.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Ethyl diazoacetate (EDA, >91.0%; Aladdin,
China), 1,2-dichloroethane (C2H4Cl2, DCE; Xilong, China), diethyl fumarate (DEF, 99%; Klamar, China),
diethyl maleate (DEM, 96%; Sinopharm, China), and dimethyl phthalate
(DMP, 99.5%; Guangfu, China) were of analytical grade and used directly
without further purification.

Experimental Setup
The experimental setup for measuring
the kinetics of EDA decomposition is shown in Figure 6. The solution of EDA in DCE was made up
and stored at room temperature and then delivered by a constant-flux
pump (Beijing Satellite). Through a preheating tube (length, 1.0 m;
OD, 1.6 mm; ID, 1.0 mm), the solution came into a serials of reaction
tubes (OD, 3.0 mm; ID, 2.0 mm). Both preheating tube and reaction
tube were immersed in a thermostat with polysiloxane as the heating
medium. The accuracy of the temperature in the thermostat could be
controlled within ±0.1 K. Two online thermocouples were placed
just before and after the reaction tubes to monitor the effect of
temperature control. The maximal temperature deviation from the preset
value was found to be less than 1 K. The reaction tubes were divided
into six sections by a seven-way switching valve and several tees.
By changing the direction of the switching valve, the volume of the
EDA passing through the reaction tube(s) could be 6.8, 13.6, 20.4,
27.2, 34.0, or 40.8 mL. After the reaction tube(s), the EDA solution
flowed into a cooling tube with a jacket (length, 2.0 mL; OD, 3.0
mm; ID, 2.0 mm; ice water as coolant) to quench the decomposition
reaction. A back-pressure valve was placed at the end of the cooling
tube to keep the back-pressure at 0.80–0.90 MPa (G). The relatively
high pressure could inhibit the evaporation of DCE during the reaction,
as well as reduce the influence of the generated nitrogen on the residence
time. All of the valves and tubes were made of stainless steel.

EDA decomposition.

Analysis Method
The effluent from the cooling tube
was collected in a chromatographic bottle filled with the solution
of DMP in DCE in advance and then weighed and analyzed by using GC
7890A (Agilent) to determine the contents of EDA, DEF, and DEM. The
GC method was established by the referring literatures.41,42 In detail, the column was an INNOWAX column (length, 30 m; ID, 0.25
mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm); the oven temperature was kept
at 318 K for 2 min, increased to 338 K by 5 K/min, kept at 338 K for
5 min, increased to 623 K by 50 K/min, and then held for 15 min; the
flow rate of nitrogen as the carrier gas was 40 mL/min with a split
ratio of 1:200; and the injector temperature was 373 K.
