Here, we report a stable tungsten
carbide hollow microsphere (W2C-HS) electrocatalyst with
robust electrocatalytic activity
toward hydrogen evolution reaction fabricated from carburization of
tungsten oxides at 700 °C with CH4/H2 flow,
which demands overpotentials of 153 and 264 mV to deliver 10 and 100
mA cm–2 ascribing to the hollow structures beneficial
for interfacial charge transfer as well as releasing of hydrogen molecular.
Meanwhile, the W2C-HS electrocatalyst exhibits undetectable
degradation after 20 000 potential cycles indicative of extraordinary
durability; in contrast, overpotential@100 mA cm–2 is dramatically increased from 128 to 251 mV after only 2000 potential
cycles for benchmark platinum electrocatalyst.

Introduction
Exploration of an efficient
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst
has been tremendously carried out because of the ever-increasing environmental
pollution as well as shortage in traditional fossil fuels.1−3 It has been proved that platinum exhibits the most efficient HER
electrocatalytic activity, which is applicable as the cathodic electrocatalyst
in the current water-splitting technology. For large-scale industrial
commercialization of water-splitting, development in an efficient
and cost-effective HER electrocatalyst as a substitution of Pt electrocatalyst
is of paramount desirability.4−7 Intensive attention has been paid to transitional-metal
sulfides,1,8,9 carbides,10−12 nitrides,13−15 phosphides,16−21 oxides,22−25 and selenides26,27 because the strong interaction
between the transition metal and H* could be loosened after the incorporation
of the above-mentioned elements, resulting in a neither too strong
nor too weak interaction between the electrocatalyst with H* triggering
efficient hydrogen evolution.28

Transition-metal
carbides (TMCs), especially molybdenum carbide
(MoxC) and tungsten carbide (WxC), have been investigated as HER electrocatalysts
because a new d band of molybdenum or tungsten on the surface appears
after combination with carbon, which was similar to the Pt d band
suggesting that the exterior TMCs possessed analogous electronic structures
compared to Pt and a comparable electrocatalytic activity to Pt was
predicted.29 Robust HER activity of TMCs
was variously achieved via morphology design to create more active
sites,30−32 heteroatom doping to tailor the electronic structure
of Mo33−35 or W36,37 resulting in a suitable interaction
between H* and active sites, and hybridization with carbon materials
to improve its electronic conductivity.38−40 However, these TMCs
only possessed low overpotentials for delivering a catalytic current
density of 10 mA cm–2, which is far from the commercialization
of water-splitting requiring massive H2 production at a
high current density above 100 mA cm–2.41 It is generally accepted that electrocatalysts
with porous structures facilitated the diffusion of active species
as well releasing of generated products;42 thus, a porous electrocatalyst is favorable for boosting HER performance
at high current density because the substantially produced H2 bubbles could be efficiently removed, resulting in less coverage
of active sites and degradation in electronic conductivity.

Motivated by the above-mentioned consideration, here, we synthesized
novel tungsten carbide hollow microspheres (W2C-HS) as
HER electrocatalysts by carburization of tungsten oxide fabricated
via the solvothermal method reported by Sun et al.43 The W2C-HS electrocatalyst could efficiently
produce H2 at high current density owing to its hollow
structures as schematically shown in Figure 1a. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report on using tungsten carbide with hollow microsphere
structures as an HER electrocatalyst.

Results and Discussion
The as-synthesized
WO3 precursor was fabricated via
a solvothermal process of sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4) and oxalic acid in water/isopropanol reported by
Sun et al.43 Subsequently, WO3 was carburized at various temperatures. In order to identify the
structures of the electrocatalysts prepared at different temperatures,
X-ray diffraction (XRD) test was carried out and the related XRD patterns
are shown in Figure 1b, in which the XRD pattern of the WO3 precursor was in
good agreement with the standard PDF card of WO3 (JCPDS:
32-1395) because the peaks appeared at 23° and 24° attributed
to the (020) and (200) planes of WO3. Diffraction peaks
at 26° and 37° were the (011) and (200) planes of WO2 (JCPDS: 32-1393), indicating that WO3 was transferred
to WO2 after heating to 600 °C under a CH4/H2 atmosphere well agreed with the previous report.44 When the temperature was increased to 650 °C,
WO2 was further reduced to metallic W proved by the observed
diffraction peaks at 40°, 58°, and 73° originating
from the (110), (200), and (211) facets of metallic W (JCPDS: 04-0806).
The carburization started at 700 °C and W2C was formed
as characteristic diffraction peaks at 39°, 34°, and 38°
were identified to (102), (002), and (200) planes of W2C according to the standard PDF card (JCPDS: 20-1315). If the temperature
was increased to 800 °C, more carbon atoms entered into the lattices
of W to form WC evidenced by the XRD peaks at 31°, 35°,
and 48° stemming from the (001), (100), and (101) facets of WC
(JCPDS: 65-8828).45 Thus, it was concluded
that WO3 was consequently transferred to WO2, W, W2C, and WC when the temperature increased from 600
to 800 °C under a CH4/H2 atmosphere.46 As shown in Figure 1c, the specific surface areas of WO3, W2C, and WC estimated from the N2 adsorption/desorption
isothermal curves were 13.0, 14.8, and 10.5 m2 g–1, respectively, which was indicative of stable structure during the
carburization process. Continuously, the morphologies of the prepared
electrocatalysts were measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
as shown in Figure 2a,b, suggesting that WO3 and W2C possessed
perfect hollow spherical structures with a diameter of 5 μm.
Additionally, WO2, W, and WC exhibited similar structures
shown in Figure S1. The well-retained structure
depicted that the carburization process negligibly affected the electrocatalyst
structure. (The samples were defined as M-HS, where HS represents
hollow microspheres.) Besides, from the SEM and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images shown in Figure 2b,c, the W2C-HS electrocatalyst
obtained a hollow structure because of the clearly observed pores
in the SEM images and distinctly different brightness in the TEM image.
Moreover, the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image depicted that a lattice
space of 0.23 nm was observed because of the main (102) plane of W2C-HS in good accordance with the XRD pattern. In order to
understand the chemical environment and bonding configuration of the
electrocatalyst, an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test was
conducted as shown in Figure S2. The two
peaks observed at 37.7 and 35.6 eV were originated from W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 for WO3-HS, manifesting the presence
of the W(VI) species (Figure 2d), whereas the two more peaks appeared at 33.9 and 31.8 eV
were assigned to the W–C bond from W2C-HS (Figure 2e), similar to previous
reports, and peaks at high binding energies of 37.7 and 35.5 eV were
due to the unavoidable exterior oxidation of W2C exposed
to air.47 Also, W 4f peaks centered at
37.8 and 35.5 eV, indicating the successful formation of WC-HS as
shown in Figure 2f.
Additionally, the C 1s peak of W2C-HS was observed and
peaks at 283.2, 284.5, and 286.5 eV were assigned to the C–W,
C=C, and C–O bonds in electrocatalysts (Figure S2), which was also an indication of successful
formation of W2C-HS.

Electrocatalytic activity toward
HER was evaluated in N2 deoxygenated 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte with
a catalyst loading of 0.285 mg cm–2. As shown in Figure 3a, benchmark Pt/C
with low overpotentials of 31 and 128 mV to achieve catalytic current
densities of 10 and 100 mA cm–2. Not surprisingly,
WO3-HS, WO2-HS, and W-HS exhibited low electrocatalytic
activity toward HER with overpotentials 558, 261, and 297 mV to deliver
a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm–2. W2C-HS required 153 and 264 mV to attain 10 and 100 mA cm–2, respectively. W2C-HS exhibited a better
HER performance compared to WC-HS as hydrogen ions strongly adsorbed
on the WC-HS surface owing to a lower ΔGH (Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption) of −0.56
eV compared to the W2C-HS (−0.31 eV) reported by
Li et al.48 A highly active HER electrocatalyst
should have ΔGH close to 0 eV, representing
a neither too strong nor too weak interaction between hydrogen ions
and active sites. Besides, W2C-HS outperformed most of
the WxC-based electrocatalysts, for instance,
WC/CNT,49 W4MoC nanowire,36 W2C@WC,50 and WC.51 In order to confirm the high
HER activity of the W2C-HS electrocatalyst, the HER activity
was conducted in H2-saturated electrolyte shown in Figure S3, in which a comparable linear sweep
voltammetry (LSV) curve was obtained for the W2C-HS electrocatalyst.
To quantitatively analyze the active sites of the obtained electrocatalysts,
the electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) calculated from the double-layer
capacitances (Figure S4) were 21.1, 37.5,
43.9, 88.3, and 12.5 mF cm–2 for WO3-HS,
WO2-HS, W-HS, W2C-HS, and WC-HS (Figure 3b), respectively, in good agreement
with the order of HER performance. It should be noted that the double-layer
capacitance was estimated from the simulated slope of Δcurrent density@0.14V versus scan rate shown in Figure 3b. The Tafel slope
was extracted from LSV curves to study the HER kinetics, and commercial
Pt/C with a Tafel slope of 29.5 mV dec–1 is shown
in Figure 3c similar
to previous report.52 W2C-HS
exhibited a much lower Tafel slope of 67.8 mV dec–1 compared to WO3-HS (107.4 mV dec–1),
WO2-HS (98.8 mV dec–1), W-HS (80.7 mV
dec–1), and WC-HS (75.4 mV dec–1) electrocatalysts, suggesting that W2C-HS followed the
Volmer–Heyrovsky HER mechanism, in which the desorption of
a hydrogen molecule is the rate-determining step (H3O+ + *Hads + e– → H2 + H2O + *, * represents the active site).53 Additionally, the interfacial charge-transfer
resistance (Rct) also significantly affected
the HER activity, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS)
of all electrocatalysts were shown in Figure 3d, in which W2C-HS exhibited the
lower Rct (60 Ω) compared to WC-HS
(600 Ω), which could be due to the more metallic W in the electrocatalyst.
It should be noted that all the EIS tests were performed at overpotential@10
mA cm–2 to study the electron transfer during the
HER test. The high ECSA and low interfacial charge-transfer resistance
co-contributed to the robust HER electrocatalytic activity of the
W2C-HS electrocatalyst. It should be noted that the intrinsic
electrocatalytic activity and the number of active sites play the
significant role of HER performance. Because of the lowest ECSA of
WO3-HS, WO3-HS showed the worst HER performance
and the ECSA order (WO3-HS < WO2-HS <
W-HS < WC-HS < W2C-HS) well coincided with the HER
performance. As well known, the massively generated hydrogen bubbles
at high overpotential cover the active sites resulting in deterioration
in HER electrocatalytic activity. In order to emphasize the advantage
of the W2C-HS electrocatalyst, HER performances of commercial
Pt/C and W2C-HS electrocatalysts were measured using the
rotating disk electrode. As well known, mass-transfer resistance could
affect the HER performance at high current density because of the
limited interfaces between electrocatalyst and electrolyte as well
as coverage of active sites byproducts. As shown in Figure 3e,f, the HER performance of
commercial Pt/C became better, especially for overpotential@100 mA
cm–2 decreased from 128 to 105 mV with the rotation
speed increased to 900 rpm because the strongly adhered H2 bubbles were removed releasing more active sites similar to previous
reports;54,55 in contrast, W2C-HS revealed
a stable HER activity with almost negligible decrement (2 mV) for
overpotential@100 mA cm–2 because of the hollow
structure of W2C-HS beneficial for the release of hydrogen
molecular resulting in no deterioration in ECSA and interfacial charge
resistance. Thus, the hollow structure was beneficial for HER electrocatalytic
activity at high current density. Durability is another important
issue for HER electrocatalyst. As shown in Figure 4a, overpotentials@10 and 100 mA cm–2 were sharply increased from 31 and 128 to 46 and 251 mV for commercial
Pt/C because of the aggregation/coalescence of Pt nanoparticles revealed
by the decreased ECSAs shown in Figure S5 lost by ∼10%, although the W2C-HS electrocatalyst
showed almost on degradation in the HER electrocatalytic activity
(Figure 4b) because
of the comparable ECSA (85.1 mF cm–2, Figure 4c) as well as a similar interfacial
charge transfer resistance before and after the durability test (Figure S6). Meanwhile, W2C-HS could
maintain a stable catalytic current density of 10 mA cm–2 for 10 h with an applied voltage of −153 V versus RHE as
shown in Figure 4d.
In addition, the overpotential@100 mA cm–2 (264
mV) for W2C-HS was comparable to that of commercial Pt/C
after durability test (251 mV), indicating that the W2C
electrocatalyst performed a similar HER activity to commercial Pt/C.
W2C-HS retained a similar structure after durability test
and the EDS mappings revealed its high durability (Figure 4e–g). The TEM image
shown in Figure S7 depicted that the structure
was well maintained after durability test confirmed by the lattice
spacing of 0.23 nm assigned to the dominant (102) facet of W2C. Meanwhile, peaks at 33.9 and 31.8 eV (Figure S8) were attributed to the W–C bond from W2C-HS coincided with TEM test. Continuously, the HER performance of
W2C-HS was tested in alkaline and neutral media shown in Figure S9, in which the overpotentials for delivering
10 mA cm–2 were 240 and 735 mV versus RHE in 1 M
KOH and 1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) electrolyte, respectively.
The lower HER activities tested in 1 M KOH and 1 M PBS compared to
the HER performance in acidic medium was due to the lower ECSA calculated
from double-layer capacitance (11.5 and 5.6 mF cm–2 in 1 M KOH and 1 M PBS). Thus, W2C-HS performed high
HER electrocatalytic activity and ultrahigh durability in acidic medium,
indicating that W2C-HS could be a potential substitution
of Pt/C for large-scale industrial water-splitting.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
synthesized novel W2C hollow microspheres
(W2C-HS) as HER electrocatalysts. W2C-HS required
153 and 264 mV to deliver cathodic current densities of 10 and 100
mA cm–2. Moreover, W2C-HS showed an ultrahigh
durability with almost no degradation in the HER activity after 20 000
potential cycles and performed a similar overpotential@100 mA cm–2 to commercial Pt/C after 2000 potential cycles. The
high HER electrocatalytic activity of W2C-HS attributed
to the hollow structures favorable for releasing of H2.
The further improvement in the HER performance of the W2C-HS electrocatalyst is undergoing in our laboratory by optimization
of size and shell thickness of the W2C-HS electrocatalyst.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of WO3
Sodium tungstate dihydrate
(1.5 g, Sinopharm, ≥99.5%) and 1.0 g of oxalic acid (Sinopharm,
≥99.8%) were dissolved in 30 mL of water with 40 mL of isopropanol
(Sinopharm, ≥99.7%), and a moderate amount of 2 M HCl (Sinopharm,
≥36.0–38.0%) was added. Then, the solution was transferred
to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated up to
80 °C for 24 h. After cooling naturally, the as-prepared samples
were calcined at 300 °C in a tube furnace with an Ar atmosphere.

Synthesis of WxC-HS
The
WO3 was heated to a specified temperature (700 and 800
°C) for 2 h with CH4 (20 sccm) and H2 (80
sccm) in a tube furnace. The final black product was filtered, washed,
and dried for 5 h.

Electrochemical Measurements
The
HER performance was
measured in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte based on
a three-electrode cell, in which a glass carbon electrode, a carbon
rod, and a saturated calomel electrode were used as working, counter,
and reference electrodes, respectively. The catalyst loading was 0.285
mg cm–2 and LSV curve was measured with a scan rate
of 5 mV s–1 and CV was carried out with 50 mV s–1 ranging from −0.3 to 0.2 V versus RHE. EIS
was measured from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz by VMP3 (Bio-Logic Science Instruments).
