A nonlinear dispersion relationship has been established
to study
the surface evolution and breakup of the cavitating liquid jet with
cavitation bubbles surrounded by the rotary air, and the built dispersion
relationship and its solution are validated by comparing with the
results in the reference. The effects of air rotation, fluid compressibility,
and bubble volume fraction on jet morphology are investigated mainly.
Air rotation changes the dominant mode of perturbation wave on the
jet surface, and more uneven corrugated flows are formed at the interface
with the increase of gas rotational strength. The fluid compressibility
has little impact on jet morphology in the circumferential direction,
while it has some impacts on the axial morphology, especially on the
arrangement of droplets. Cavitation bubbles will affect the jet morphology,
while the effect is smaller than gas rotation. Both swirling gas and
fluid compressibility promote the jet breakup, while the influence
of compressibility on jet breakup is obviously greater than gas rotation.
In addition, the bubble volume fraction will promote the breakup of
the cavitating liquid jet; however, this kind of promoting impact
decreases with the increase of the cavitation bubble volume fraction.

1 Introduction
Liquid jets generally
exist in nature and engineering, such as
diesel engines, cylinder direct injection gasoline engines, gas turbines,
and other power machinery.1,2 The fuel injection process
has an important impact on the power, economy, and emission characteristics
of the power machinery. The breakup and atomization process of fuel
jets is actually the instability process of liquid jets. In the liquid
injection process, the disturbance wave on the liquid surface will
continue to develop, which will cause jet morphology change and splitting
after instability. The stability of liquid jets has always been a
research hotspot in the field of fluid mechanics.

Now, there
are two main theories to study the instability of liquid
jets, linear instability analysis and nonlinear instability analysis.

The research on the instability of liquid jets used by linear instability
analysis is always the focus of attention.3−6 The purpose of linear instability
analysis is to obtain the maximum temporal or spatial disturbance
growth rate, the oscillation frequency, the dominant wavenumber, and
other jet instability conditions. However, linear instability analysis
only considers that the disturbance at the interface of liquid jets
is of the first order and neglects the second order and more high
order disturbances. Therefore, the calculation results about jet morphology
and jet breakup are inaccurate7 but these
parameters are the key indicators to determine jet atomization.

Compared with linear instability analysis, nonlinear instability
analysis considers high order disturbances and can better reflect
the changes of jet morphology and breakup situation. For now, a lot
of research studies have reported on the instability of liquid jets
by using the nonlinear instability analysis, and the liquid jet morphology
and breakup have also been analyzed under some assumed conditions.8−20 Nonlinear instability analysis has been used to study the liquid
jet morphology and breakup with swirling air,13 but the effect of air rotation on liquid surface morphology has
not been found. Due to the complexity, the effect of air compressibility
on liquid jet morphology has been ignored.19

In fact, in internal combustion engines, airflow is always
swirling
when diesel ejects out of the nozzle. In addition, with the increasingly
stringent emission control requirements and energy shortage conditions,
people want to increase fuel injection pressure as a kind of technical
measure to meet the requirements of lower emission and higher combustion
efficiency of diesel engines. Therefore, a study on the influences
of fluid compressibility and air rotation on liquid jet morphology
and instability has become more and more important. To our knowledge,
studying the nonlinear evolution and instability of the cavitating
liquid jet surrounded by the rotary compressible air has not been
reported.

Based on our previous research,4 which
studied the temporal instability and spatial instability of a cavitating
liquid jet surrounded by the rotary compressible airflow by using
linear instability analysis, this paper has analyzed the nonlinear
evolution and instability of a cavitating liquid jet surrounded by
the rotary compressible air by the use of three-dimensional nonlinear
spatial instability theory. In Section 2, the first-order dispersion equation and second-order
dispersion equation have been established, respectively, and the built
dispersion equations and their solutions are validated by comparing
with the results from the reference in Section 3. Then, in Section 4, the influences of air rotation, fluid compressibility,
and bubble volume fraction on jet morphology are investigated, respectively.

2 Physical Model and Governing Equations
The research object is the ejection of a cavitating liquid jet
into the rotary air. Liquid and air are inviscid and compressible.
The nozzle radius is a, the jet velocity is U0, and the rotary velocity of air is W0 in the θ direction. Figure 1 gives the schematic of a cavitating
liquid jet surrounded by the rotary air. It is assumed that there
is no slippage between the cavity and the liquid, there is no interaction
between the bubbles, and the cavitating liquid jet is a continuous
medium.10

Figure 1 Schematic of a cavitating liquid jet surrounded
by the rotary air.

The basic flow field when the jet is not disturbed
(jet velocity,
swirling air velocity, the pressure relationship between liquid and
air) are listed as follows4 1   2   3  where V̅1 is
the velocity of the liquid jet, V̅2 is
the air velocity. p̅1 is the liquid-side
pressure, p̅2 is the air-side pressure,
σ is the factor of surface tension. ρ̅2 is the density of the surrounding air.

Cavitating liquid jet
density and sound speed are listed as follows21,22 4   5  where ρ̅1 represents
the density of the cavitating liquid jet, ρv is the
bubble density, ρl is the liquid density, c1 represents the sound speed of the cavitating
liquid jet, kv is the adiabatic index
of the bubble, zv is the compressibility
factor of the bubble, R represents the air constant, El represents the liquid elasticity modulus,
and α represents the bubble volume fraction (0 ≤ α
≤ 0.2) in the study.

2.1 Disturbance Governing Equations
The
research object meets the continuity equation and Euler equations 6   7  where i = 1 represents the
jet parameters, and i = 2 represents the air parameters.

The flow parameters are given as follows 8  where the horizontal line is the unperturbed
parameter, and the apostrophe is the perturbed parameter.

Using
the disturbance expansion method, the perturbed parameters
can be listed as follows 9  where η0 is the initial amplitude
of perturbed parameters.

In addition, the cavitating liquid
jet requires ∂p1′/∂p1′ = c12 and coupling eqs 1–9, we get the normalized
first- and second-order governing equations as follows:

First
order (η0)

For the cavitating jet 10   11  For the surrounding air 12   13  Second order (η02)

For the cavitating jet 14   15   16   17  For the surrounding air 18   19   20   21  where E = W0/(U0a), Q = ρ̅2/ρ̅1, and Mai = U0/ci.

2.2 Solution of a Set of Equations
Employing eq 9, the perturbed pressure
is listed as follows 22  where m represents the angular
wavenumber, m1 is the first-order angular
wavenumber, m2 is the second-order angular
wavenumber, k1= k1r + ik1i, is the first-order axial wavenumber, k2= k2r + ik2i, is the second-order axial
wavenumber, ω1 and ω2 are the first
and second-order complex wave frequencies, ω1 = ω1r + iω1i, ω2 = ω2r + iω2i.

The solution of the first-order
pressure disturbance is the modified Bessel function as follows 23  where d11 is the
constant. I is the first kind of modified Bessel function. n1 = (k12 + Ma12(ω1 – ik1)2)0.5.

Substituting eq 23 into eq 11,
the first-order
velocity disturbance is solved as follows 24  For the surrounding air, substituting eq 22 into eqs 12 and 13,
the first-order pressure and velocity disturbance are listed as follows 25   26  where d22 is the
integration constant, n2 = (k12 + Ma22(ω1 + im1E)2)0.5.

For the solving process of the second-order
disturbance, it is
difficult to get the solution as the first-order disturbance. However,
the second-order disturbance can be solved by using the symbolic mathematical
computation program Mathematica. Therefore, we do not discuss the
solution of the second-order disturbances here.

2.3 Boundary Conditions
The kinematic
and dynamic boundary conditions at the air–liquid interface
will be discussed next.

Kinematic boundary condition satisfies 27  where F = 0, is the air–liquid
interface equation 28  where η is the amplitude of interface
disturbance 29  where η1 and η2 are the first-order and the second-order disturbance components,
respectively.

Substituting eqs 28 and 29 into eq 27, we can get the nondimensional
kinematic boundary
conditions 30   31  The dynamic boundary condition
satisfies4,23 32  Coupling eqs 3, 9, and 22, we can obtain the nondimensional dynamic boundary conditions 33   34   35  where We = σ/ρ̅1U02a.

2.4 Dispersion Relationship
Based on
the above discussions, the first- and second-order dispersion equations
about the instability of the cavitating liquid jet surrounded by the
rotary compressible air will be built. Substituting eqs 24–26 into eqs 30 and 33, we get the disturbance equation of the form |A(m1, k1, ω1)| = 0.4 As to the second-order dispersion equation, it can be built
by coupling the solutions of second-order disturbance parameters and eqs 31, 34, and 35.

In this paper, the secant method
with superlinear convergence is used to solve the dispersion equations
iteratively, and the used software is a symbolic mathematical computation
program Mathematica.

The development state of surface disturbance
can be obtained by
taking the perturbation growth rate in spatial mode, axial wavenumber,
and oscillation frequency obtained by the first- and second-order
dispersion relationships into eq 27. In addition, combining r = a + η(t,θ,z) = 0, the breakup length lb of the cavitating
liquid jet surrounded by the rotary compressible air will be gotten.

3 Verification
To verify the correctness
of the above dispersion relationship
of the cavitating liquid jet surrounded by the rotary compressible
air, the experimental conditions24 are
used for calculation, and the results are compared with the experimental
data provided in the reference. The comparison result is shown in Figure 2. Abscissa We represents the reciprocal of Weber number, and ordinate
nondimensional breakup length Lb is the
ratio of actual breakup length lb and
nozzle diameter d0.

Figure 2 Comparison of calculation
and experimental results.24

From the comparison results given in Figure 2, it can be seen that the calculation
results
of the nondimensional breakup length obtained by using the built dispersion
relationship in this paper are consistent with the changing trend
of experimental results,24 which indicates
the correctness of this dispersion relationship and its solution method
based on nonlinear instability analysis.

4.1 Effect of Swirling Gas on Jet Morphology
Figure 3 shows that
the spatial evolution (liquid jet morphology) at the jet surface under
different nondimensional air rotational strengths.

Figure 3 Spatial evolution of
the liquid jet under different nondimensional
air rotary strengths. (a) E = 0, (b) E = 0.01, (c) E = 0.025, (d) E =
0.05, and (e) E = 0.25.

As shown in Figure 3, swirling gas has an important influence on the morphology
of the
liquid jet. When the surrounding gas is not swirling, as shown in Figure 3a, along the jet
direction indicated by an arrow, the jet breakup proceeds in an axisymmetric
manner. When the surrounding gas is swirling (E ≠
0), the jet morphology is changed, the cross section of the liquid
jet will no longer be circular, and the disturbance waveform on the
surface of the liquid jet also distorts from axisymmetric to increasingly
asymmetric, which indicates that air rotation changes the morphology
of the perturbation wave at the air–liquid interface, and the
dominant mode changes from axisymmetric to asymmetric with the existence
of swirling gas.

In addition, it is also found from Figure 3 that more and more
uneven corrugated flows
are formed on the jet surface with the increase of air rotary strength.
When the amplitude of disturbance on the jet surface increases to
a certain value, these ripples are likely to be torn apart to form
some thin ligaments and then beak up into tiny droplets.

Actually,
jet morphology is mainly determined by the dominating
azimuthal wave mode corresponding to the most unstable disturbance
mode. To reflect the influence of swirling gas on jet morphology more
clearly, Figure 4 gives
the dominating azimuthal wave modes under different nondimensional
gas rotational strengths.

Figure 4 Dominating azimuthal wave modes under different
nondimensional
gas rotational strengths.

As shown in Figure 4, with the increase of air rotary strength, the dominating
azimuthal
wave mode corresponding to the most unstable disturbance mode increases
linearly, which suggests that the influence of swirling air on jet
morphology is obvious.

4.2 Effect of Compressibility on Jet Morphology
Note that Ma1 and Ma2 can reflect the liquid and air compressibility. Figure 5 shows that the three-dimensional
spatial evolution of liquid jet under different liquid and air Mach
numbers. Also, only the jet morphology close to breakup is shown here.

Figure 5 Spatial
evolution of the liquid jet under different liquid and
air Mach numbers. (a) Ma1 = Ma2 = 0, (b) Ma1 = 0.1, Ma2 = 0.29, and (c) Ma1 = 0.2, Ma2 = 0.57.

As shown in Figure 5, the compressibility of the liquid jet and surrounding
gas has little
effect on the morphology of the liquid jet in the circumferential
direction. Considering the fluid compressibility or not, along the
jet direction, the cross section of the liquid jet is always circular
and the jet breakup proceeds in an axisymmetric manner. However, it
is also displayed from Figure 5 that the axial morphology of the liquid jet changes with
the increase of the jet and gas Mach numbers. As shown in Figure 5a, within a certain
distance close to jet breakup, the axial morphology of the liquid
jet is composed of “main droplet + satellite droplet + main
droplet + satellite droplet”. Referring to Figure 5b, within a certain distance
close to jet breakup, the axial morphology of the liquid jet changed
to be composed of “satellite droplet + main droplet + satellite
droplet + main droplet”. As shown in Figure 5c, within a certain distance close to jet
breakup, the axial morphology of liquid jet is composed of “satellite
droplet + main droplet + satellite droplet + main droplet + satellite
droplet”. Therefore, a comparison of Figure 5a–c demonstrates that the fluid compressibility
has some impacts on the axial morphology of the liquid jet, especially
on the arrangement of droplets. The main reason is that the higher
Mach number means the higher jet speed, which makes the effect of
gas–liquid interaction on the axial morphology of the liquid
jet more stronger and leads to more morphology elements (as shown
in Figure 5c).

4.3 Effect of Bubble Volume Fraction on Jet Morphology
Next, we will discuss the effect of bubble volume fraction on the
morphology of the liquid jet surrounded by rotary compressible air. Figure 6 gives the spatial
evolution of the cavitating liquid jet under different bubble volume
fractions. Only the jet morphology close to breakup is shown.

Figure 6 Spatial evolution
of the cavitating liquid jet under different
bubble volume fractions. (a) α = 0, (b) α = 0.05, and
(c) α = 0.1.

As shown in Figure 6, compared with the jet morphology when the bubble
volume fraction
α = 0, more corrugated flows are formed on the jet surface when
the bubble volume fraction α ≠ 0, which indicates that
the existence of the cavitation phenomenon will affect the jet morphology
to some extent. However, the effect of the bubble volume fraction
on jet morphology is smaller than swirling gas.

4.4 Cavitating Jet Breakup
Based on the
built second-order dispersion equation, the influences of the rotary
air, the fluid compressibility, and the bubble volume fraction on
the jet breakup length will be discussed, respectively.

Figure 7 shows the nondimensional
jet breakup lengths under different nondimensional gas rotational
strengths.

Figure 7 Jet breakup lengths under different gas rotational strengths.

As shown in Figure 7, when the gas rotational strength E = 0, the nondimensional
jet breakup length Lb = 101.0. When gas
rotational strength E = 0.01, the nondimensional
jet breakup length Lb = 100.8. When the
gas rotational strength E = 0.05, the nondimensional
jet breakup length Lb = 100.0. When the
gas rotational strength E = 0.25, the nondimensional
jet breakup length Lb = 90.6. Therefore,
with the 5-fold growth of gas rotational strength, the jet breakup
length first decreases slowly and then decreases sharply, which suggests
that swirling gas has a destabilizing effect on the liquid jet, but
the destabilizing effect of swirling gas on liquid jet becomes obvious
when the gas rotational strength increases to a certain value.

Figure 8 gives the
nondimensional jet breakup lengths under different nondimensional
jet and gas Mach numbers.

Figure 8 Jet breakup lengths under different jet and
gas Mach numbers.

It is seen from Figure 8 that the nondimensional jet breakup length
decreases rapidly
with the increase of jet and gas Mach numbers, which suggests that
fluid compressibility promotes the breakup of the jet. In addition,
comparing Figure 8 with Figure 7, it is also found
that the effect of fluid compressibility on breakup length is obviously
greater than swirling gas.

Figure 9 gives the
nondimensional jet breakup lengths under different bubble volume fractions.

Figure 9 Jet breakup
lengths under different bubble volume fractions.

It can be found from Figure 9 that the nondimensional jet breakup length
decreases and
the decreasing extent declines gradually with the increase of the
bubble volume fraction, which indicates that the bubble volume fraction
has a big influence on promoting the breakup of the jet; however,
this promoting effect reduces gradually with the increase of the bubble
volume fraction. Note that when the value of the bubble volume fraction
approaches 0.2, the instability analysis will lose its validity.

5 Conclusions
A nonlinear dispersion
relationship has been carried out to model
the nonlinear evolution and instability of a cavitating liquid jet
surrounded by rotary compressible air. Then, the effects of air rotation,
fluid compressibility, and bubble volume fraction on jet morphology
and breakup length are investigated mainly.(1) The coaxial rotation of the surrounding
gas changes the dominant mode of the perturbation wave on the surface
of the liquid jet, and the dominant mode changes from axisymmetric
to asymmetric with the existence of swirling gas. More and more uneven
corrugated flows are formed on the jet surface with the increase of
air rotary strength. When the amplitude of disturbance on the jet
surface increases to a certain value, these ripples are likely to
be torn apart to form some thin ligaments and then break up into tiny
droplets. With the increase of air rotary strength, the dominating
azimuthal wave mode corresponding to the most unstable disturbance
mode increases linearly.

(2) The fluid compressibility has little
effect on the morphology of the liquid jet in a circumferential direction.
Considering the fluid compressibility or not, along the jet direction,
the cross section of the liquid jet is always circular, and the jet
breakup proceeds in an axisymmetric manner. However, the fluid compressibility
has some impacts on the axial morphology of the liquid jet, especially
on the arrangement of droplets.

(3) The existence of the cavitation phenomenon
will affect the jet morphology to some extent. However, the effect
of the bubble volume fraction on jet morphology is smaller than swirling
gas.

(4) Breakup length
decreases slowly with
the increase of air rotary strength; however, when the gas rotational
strength is further increased, the breakup length of the liquid jet
decreases sharply. Therefore, swirling gas has a destabilizing influence
on the liquid jet, and the destabilizing influence of swirling gas
on the liquid jet becomes obvious when the gas rotational strength
increases to a certain value.

(5) Breakup length decreases rapidly with
the increase of liquid and gas Mach numbers, so the fluid compressibility
promotes the liquid jet breakup. In addition, the influence of fluid
compressibility on jet breakup is obviously greater than air rotation.

(6) Breakup length decreases
and the decreasing
extent declines gradually with the increase of the bubble volume fraction,
which indicates that the bubble volume fraction has a big influence
on promoting the jet breakup; however, this promoting influence decreases
with the increase of the bubble volume fraction.
