The composite cathode material of the conductive polymer
polyaniline (PANI)-coated spinel structural LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) for high-voltage lithium-ion batteries
has been successfully synthesized by an in situ chemical oxidation
polymerization method. The electrode of the LNMO–PANI composite
material shows superior rate capability and excellent cycling stability.
A capacity of 123.4 mAh g–1 with the capacity retention
of 99.7% can be maintained at 0.5C after 200 cycles in the voltage
range of 3.0–4.95 V (vs Li/Li+) at room temperature.
Even with cycling at 5C, a capacity of 65.5 mAh g–1 can still be achieved. The PANI coating layer can not only reduce
the dissolution of Ni and Mn from the LNMO cubic framework into the
electrolyte during cycling, but also significantly improve the undesirable
interfacial reactions between the cathode and electrolyte, and markedly
increase the electrical conductivity of the electrode. At 55 °C,
the LNMO–PANI composite material exhibits more superior cyclic
performance than pristine, that is, the capacity retention of 94.5%
at 0.5C after 100 cycles vs that of 13.0%. This study offers an effective
strategy for suppressing the decomposition of an electrolyte under
the highly oxidizing (>4.5 V) and elevated temperature conditions.

==== Body
Introduction
Compared to anode materials, cathode materials exhibit
a relatively lower specific capacity and hardly meet the increasing
energy needs.1,2 It is significant for lithium-ion
batteries to increase their working voltage to achieve the energy
demands.3
Whereupon, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO)
has been considered as one of the most promising cathodes for lithium-ion
batteries due to low-cost and pollution-free nature.4−8 In particular, it also attains a high-energy
density of 686 Wh kg–1 by the redox couples of Ni2+/Ni4+ located at ∼4.7 V (vs Li/Li+) in the spinel LNMO.9

In terms
of these great superiorities, LNMO is paid more and more attention
by scientific research workers. However, its self-deficiencies still
exist which may obstruct its further development.10 Primarily, the pivotal voltage platform of LNMO (∼4.7
V vs Li/Li+) beyond the stabilized limitation of the traditional
electrolyte (≤4.5 V vs Li/Li+) cannot effectively
resist the oxidation decomposition of the electrolyte under such high
electric potential.11 This may lead to
the generation of a pernicious solid electrolyte interphase film which
could hinder the intercalation/deintercalation for lithium ions and
increase the interface resistance.12,13 Furthermore,
it may cause Ni and Mn atoms to dissolve from the spinel LNMO spinel
into the electrolyte due to HF, as well as the Ni and Mn ions dissolution
may be accelerated under high temperature and pressure.14−18 The equations are as follows 1   2   3  Finally,
the Jahn–Teller distortion also propels the Mn3+ ions to form Mn2+ in the further stage of discharge cycling19 and the Mn2+ ions squint towards
to dissolve into the electrolyte, resulting in the irreversible capacity
loss. In particular, detrimental reactions may be expedited at elevated
temperatures,20 and it immensely obstructs
the commercialized prospect of the high-voltage LNMO cathode for lithium-ion
batteries.

Universally, it is proved that surface coating using
some metal oxides is an appropriate strategy to surmount these deficiencies
of LNMO, such as Al2O3,21 ZnO,22,23 TiO2,24 Fe2O3,25 LaFeO3,1818 Li2SiO3,26 Li2SnO3,27 LiCoO2,17 etc. The results show that these metal
oxides, working as a protective layer, could avoid the undesirable
interface reactions and reduce the dissolution amounts of the transition
metal ions. To a certain extent, these coating layers have improved
the LMNO material performance. Meanwhile, another approach has been
utilized to ameliorate the cycling stability of the LNMO electrode
with carbon coating.28−31 But it is possible for the high valence
of Mn and Ni in LNMO to revert to the low state during carbonizing
at high temperature. Accordingly, it is urgent to discover a new kind
of coating agent which can not only act as a protective skin but also
can enhance the electrical conductivity.

Since the conductive
polymers were regarded as a superior coating agent, they are favorable
materials coated on LMNO to improve cycling stabilities at room and
elevated temperatures. For instance, Kim et al.32 have studied that polyimide (PI) was coated on the surface
of LNMO by thermal polymerization, and it could optimize the unwanted
interfacial reactions and provide the superior lithium storage properties
by the introduction of the PI coating layer. However, the low cycle
ability of the LNMO–PI composite electrode under elevated temperatures
was attributed to the poor compatibility toward the electrolyte solution.
Subsequently, Gao et al.33 have reported
that a polypyrrole was used to coat on the LNMO surface via a chemical
oxidation polymerization method. In spite of the great improvement
of the conductivity, the lithium storage capacity is still not very
ideal. Hence, it is still meaningful to seek another conductive polymer
to improve electrochemical performance of LNMO on the basis of good
conductivity. In the field of conductive polymers, polyaniline (PANI)
has been paid close attention because of the cheap raw materials and
easy preparation process.34−38 In
this study, we have successfully prepared the PANI-coated LNMO electrode
by a simple in situ chemical oxidative polymerization method in the
ice-water bath. As expected, LNMO–PANI composite material shows
superior rate capability and excellent cycling stability. A capacity
of 123.4 mAh g–1 with the capacity retention of
99.7% can be maintained at 0.5C after 200 cycles in the voltage range
of 3.0–4.95 V (vs Li/Li+) at room temperature. Even
with cycling at 5C, a capacity of 65.5 mAh g–1 can
still be achieved. The PANI coating layer can not only reduce the
dissolution of Ni and Mn from the LNMO cubic framework into the electrolyte
during cycling, but also significantly improve the undesirable interfacial
reactions between the cathode and the electrolyte, and markedly increase
the electrical conductivity of the electrode.

Results and Discussion
From Figure 1, the presence of PANI in the composite was
confirmed by the Raman spectrometer. The bare LNMO exhibits that the
stretching vibration of Mn–O in the MnO6 octahedral
phase is located at 634 cm–1. The characteristic
bands of 402 and 494 cm–1 are corresponding to the
stretching vibrations of Ni–O, and the characteristic band
of 598 cm–1 is in accordance with the T2g vibration mode of the spinel structural compounds.39,40 Beyond this, there also appears the characteristic bands of polyaniline
in the as-prepared LNMO–PANI composite material. The characteristic
bands at 1550 and 1453 cm–1 may be the stretching
vibration of C=C and C=N in the quinoid (−N=Q=N–,
where Q = quinoid frame) model. The characteristic band of 1334 cm–1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of C–N
in the benzenoid unit. The characteristic band at 1181 cm–1 belongs to the stretching vibration of the quinoid model. The appearance
of these iconic characteristic bands proves the presence of PANI in
the synthesized composite.41,42

bare LNMO and the LNMO–PANI composite material.

The PANI content
in the composite was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
in Figure 2. The samples
were heated from 20 to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C min–1 under air atmosphere. It can be seen that the bare
LNMO maintains a constant weight, however, the retained mass of the
composite decreases as the temperature increases.43 Therefore, it indicates that the PANI content in the composite
is calculated to be about 1 wt %.

The morphologies of the bare
LNMO and the LNMO–PANI composite material were characterized
by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Figure 3. A smooth surface of the bare LNMO can be
seen in Figure 3a.
However, a reversely rough surface of the LNMO–PANI composite
material is observed in Figure 3b, which indicates that a relatively homogeneous PANI layer
has been coated successfully on the surface of LNMO particles.
As shown in Figure 3c, it is relatively well-distributed on the surface of the LNMO particles,
and the thickness of the PANI layer is around 20 nm as shown in Figure 3d.

and (d) thickness of the PANI layer of the LNMO–PANI composite
material.

To further
verify the dispersing of the coated PANI on the surface of the composite
particles, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) of the TEM pattern
was performed. From Figure 4a–g, it can be clearly observed that the disperse positions
of the elements C and N are consistent with the distributed positions
of the elements Ni, Mn, and O in the mappings. This confirms that
the PANI layer uniformly coated on the surface of the LNMO particles
again, and the atomic fraction is 0.99%, which is very close to the
actual coating amount of PANI.

fraction of C, N, O, Mn, and Ni elements.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
of the bare LNMO and the LNMO–PANI composite material is displayed
in Figure 5. It is
demonstrated that the bare LNMO and LNMO–PANI composite material
are both corresponding to the Fd3m cubic spinel structure (JCPDS
No. 32-0581), and the PANI coating layer of the LNMO–PANI composite
does not have obvious effect on the crystal crystallinity of the spinel
LNMO.

pattern of the bare LNMO and the
LNMO–PANI composite material.

The first, 100th, and 200th charge–discharge curves
and cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the bare LNMO and LNMO–PANI
composite material electrodes were obtained in the voltage range from
3.0 to 4.95 V (vs Li/Li+) at room temperature (25 °C)
as shown in Figure 6. The electrodes were first activated at 0.1C rate (1C = 147 mAh
g–1) for 3 cycles, and then they were tested at
0.5C for 200 cycles. In Figure 6a,b, there is a remarkable voltage plateau at ∼4.7
V. This may be assigned to the Fermi level from Ni2+ to
Ni4+, which is confined to the top of the O 2p valence
band,44 and it can be ascribed to the two
redox couples for Ni2+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/Ni4+ both located near 4.7 V. Whereupon, the voltage
difference is specially wispy. In addition, there is also a tiny voltage
plateau at ∼4.0 V in Figure 6a,b, which is associated with the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox reaction. Compared with Figure 6a, the LNMO–PANI composite material
electrode presents an excellent reversibility, and no other voltage
plateaus are sighted in Figure 6b, indicating that the PANI does not lead to an extra redox
reaction in the tested voltage range. It means that the PANI only
remains stable during cycling and does not contribute to the discharge
capacity. Figure 6c,d
shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the bare LNMO and the
LNMO–PANI composite material electrodes at room temperature
by a sweep rate of 0.05 mV s–1. The two chief peaks
located at around 4.7 V are attached to Ni2+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/Ni4+, and the secondary peak at around
4.0 V is connected to the transformation of Mn3+/ Mn4+. The peak area at ∼4.0 V is much smaller than the
peak area at ∼4.7 V, which tautologically proves that the primary
contribution to the discharge capacity is from the Ni2+/Ni4+ redox couple. The over-potentials of the bare LNMO
and the LNMO–PANI composite material electrodes are synchronized
with 0.442 and 0.314 V during the first cycle, which means a much
lower polarization during the electrochemical reaction process for
the coated LNMO electrode. In addition, there is no additional peak
after coating as shown in Figure 6c. It also indicates that the PANI does not practically
involve in the redox reactions in the tested voltage range. The results
discussed above are in great agreement with the consequence of the
charge–discharge curves.33

material electrodes at room temperature by a sweep rate of 0.05 mV
s–1.

The cycling and rate performances of the bare LNMO and the LNMO–PANI
composite material at room temperature are shown in Figure 7. First, the cells were activated
at 0.1C for 3 cycles, and then they were charged–discharged
at 0.5C for 200 cycles in Figure 7a. The initial discharge capacity of the bare LNMO
is 117.4 mAh g–1 at the first cycle, and then it
increases and remains at about 120 mAh g–1 by 90
cycles. Afterwards, it continuously decreases to 115.4 mAh g–1 after 200 cycles. In contrast, the composite electrode exhibits
a higher initial discharge capacity of 123.8 mAh g–1, and after over 200 cycles, it is still remains at 123.4 mAh g–1. The reversible capacity retention is as high as
99.7%. It is significant to find that the discharge specific capacity
has achieved universal enhancement after PANI coating, which may be
due to the polyaniline, which works as a valid protective layer and
could effectively reduce the dissolution of Mn and Ni from the spinel
LNMO into the electrolyte during cycling. Eventually, it will successfully
enhance the discharge capacity and improve the cycling stability. Figure 7b shows the rate
capabilities of the bare and modified LNMO electrodes at different
current densities and room temperature.
The activation conditions as above, then testing at various current
densities from 0.5 to 5.0C for 10 cycles each, finally returning to
0.5C for 10 cycles. The rate capacities of the bare LNMO are 110.2,
104.2, 89.8, and 55.7 mAh g–1 at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0,
and 5.0C, respectively. When the current density was returned to 0.5C,
the rate capacity recovered up to 108.3 mAh g–1.
In comparison, when the rate capacities of the LNMO–PANI composite
material accompanied by 124.1 to 65.5 mAh g–1 along
with the current densities changed from 0.5 to 5.0C, as well as the
rate capacity rising to 120.8 mAh g–1 while the
current density backing up to 0.5C. Thus, it can be seen that the
bare LNMO exhibits a relatively poor rate capability. It indicates
that the PANI layer could improve the characteristics of the LNMO,
leading to an excellent rate capability at different current densities.

composite material at 0.5C and room temperature and (b) the rate capabilities
of the bare LNMO and the LNMO–PANI composite material electrodes
at different current densities and room temperature.

The charge–discharge curves of the bare LNMO and the LNMO–PANI
composite material electrodes were acquired at an elevated temperature
(55 °C) by the first, 50th and 100th cycles. Before cycling,
the cells were activated at 0.1C for 3 cycles at room temperature.
As shown in Figure 8a,b, the electrodes display the analogical initial discharge capacities
of 107.0 and 112.8 mAh g–1, respectively. Subsequently,
the discharge capacity of the bare LNMO electrode decreases to 17.5
mAh g–1. Meanwhile, the LNMO–PANI composite
material rises first and then remains at 123.4 mAh g–1 until 50 cycles. After that, the discharge capacity of the composite
electrode tardily drops to 106.6 mAh g–1 at the
100th cycle. Although the higher temperature can promote the transfer
behavior of lithium ions and soaking of electrolyte into the separator
film, it would accelerate the undesirable interfacial reactions between
the cathode and the electrolyte. The products from these side reactions
are easy to deposit on the surface of LNMO, resulting in the increase
of the polarization resistance and interfacial impedance. In particular,
at the high operating voltage of 5 V, it would also expedite the formation
of HF along with the decomposition of the electrolyte. The incremental
concentration of HF would enhance the dissolution of Mn and Ni, which
causes a large irreversible capacity attenuation as shown in Figure 8a. By contrast, the
PANI layer coated on the surfer of LNMO, working as an admirable protective
skin, could significantly reduce the dissolution of Mn and Ni by suppressing
the decomposition of the electrolyte to a great extent. Hence, it
can be seen that the discharge capacity of the composite electrode
presents a relatively satisfied reversibility as shown in Figure 8b. Figure 8c compares the cycling performances
of the bare LNMO and the LNMO–PANI composite material at 0.5C
and elevated temperatures. Before formally testing, the cells were
activated at 0.1C for 3 cycles at room temperature. The bare LNMO
delivers a discharge capacity of 13.9 mAh g–1 at
the 100th cycle, which means that it has a capacity retention of only
13.0%. However, the discharge capacity of the LNMO–PANI composite
material is 106.6 mAh g–1 at the 100th cycle, and
it also shows a better capacity retention of 94.5% than that of the
bare LNMO. The cycling performance tautologically proves that the
LNMO–PANI composite material possesses more superior high temperature
cycle stability than the bare LNMO. The PANI coating layer separates
the electrolyte and LMNO effectively, decreases the side reaction
at the highly oxidizing conditions (>4.5 V), and suppresses the
dissolution of the transition metal ions.

curves of the bare LNMO and the LNMO–PANI composite material
electrodes, (b) cycling performance of the bare LNMO and the LNMO–PANI
composite material electrodes at elevated temperature (55 °C).

To some extent, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) may be considered as one of the most
cogent tools to study the difference of the electrochemical behaviors
between the bare LNMO and the LNMO–PANI composite material
electrodes.45 In Figure 9, the Nyquist plots show an intercept at
high frequency for the electrolyte resistance, Re. Rc is marked as the contact
resistance at high frequency from the intercept of the semicircle
of the x-axis, which can be obtained from the electrical
contacts between the electrolyte, the active materials, and the current
collector. Following, Rct, the charge
transfer resistance, is located at the high-middle frequency region,
and the low frequency region of the straight line is interpreted to
the diffusion resistance of the lithium ions into the electrode material,
which is the Warburg diffusion impedance, Wd. From Figure 9a,b,
the diameters of the semicircles for the bare and coated electrodes
before cycling at room temperature are 97 and 107 Ω, respectively.
After the 1st cycle, a legible distinction was observed that the diameter
values were 365 and 230 Ω. The diameter of the semicircle data,
90 and 78 Ω, were gained after 200 cycles, which were also used
for fitting the equivalent circuit in the insets of Figure 9a. Before cycling, at elevated
temperatures, alternating current impedance tests of the cells before
and after coating were also executed. The Nyquist plots still consist
of a semicircle and a straight line. The diameters of the semicircle
values, 808 and 436 Ω, were obtained after 100 cycles at 55
°C, and they were also matched with the equivalent circuit. From Figure 9, it can be seen
that there is a clear increase after coating for the conductivity
at both room and elevated temperatures, which again confirms that
the introduction of the PANI layer is an effective method for enhancing
the electron transport of LNMO. As a consequence, the PANI layer,
working as a conductive coating agent, can diminish the polarization
resistance and interfacial impedance by improving the severe interfacial
reactions, leading to a significant improvement in the electrochemical
performance.

(d) the LNMO–PANI composite material at 55 °C.

As we all know that the diffusion coefficient of
the lithium ions in the electrode is identified as an important parameter
for measuring the electrochemical performance of active materials,46,47 and it could be calculated by eqs 4 and 5. Where Zre is the real axis resistance of the low frequency region
(Ω); σw is the Warburg diffusion impedance
coefficient (Ω s–0.5); and ω is the
angular frequency at low frequency (s–1); R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol–1 K–1); T is the absolute temperature
(K); n is the number of the transferred electron
of per mole active material involved in the electrode reaction; A is the area of the electrode surface (cm2); F is the Faraday’s constant (96485 C mol–1); and c is the molar concentration of the lithium
ions (mol cm–3). The plot of Zre vs the reciprocal square root of the lower angular frequencies
is shown in Figure 10. It is observed that the σw values of the LNMO–PANI
composite material electrodes are lower than the bare LNMO electrodes
at both room and elevated temperatures. Consistently, the diffusion
coefficient of the lithium ions for LNMO–PANI composite material
electrodes is higher than that of the bare LNMO electrodes at both
room and elevated temperatures. Therefore, the charge transfer reaction
is stronger in the LNMO–PANI composite material electrodes
than the bare LNMO electrodes. Besides, the parameter values of the
bare LNMO and LNMO–PANI composite material electrodes at both
25 and 55 °C are all recorded in Table 1. 4   5  The cells after 200 cycles at 25 °C and after
100 cycles at 55 °C were disassembled. Then the sheets, the separator
films, the Li foils, and the electro-conductive gaskets were all dissolved
in the dimethyl carbonate (DMC) along with the anode and cathode shells.
Afterwards, they were placed for 2 days in the Ar-filled glove-box.
Next, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) was used to observe the dissolved
amount of Ni and Mn from the spinel LNMO into the electrolyte, recorded
in Table 2. It is clear
to observe that the dissolution amount of Ni and Mn of the bare LNMO
is greater than the LNMO–PANI composite material, which again
demonstrates that the PANI layer, working as a protective skin, effectively
suppresses the dissolution of the transition metal ions.

angular
frequencies for the bare LNMO and the LNMO–PANI composite material

Figure 11a–f shows
the EDS mappings of LNMO–PANI electrode. In Figure 11c, the presence of N element
indicates that the PANI is still coated on the surface of the LNMO
material after cycling, which plays a protective layer on the LNMO.
The homogeneous distribution of N, Mn, and Ni elements is illustrated
in Figure 11g–i.
The binding energy of N 1s spectra is 399.8 eV, indicating that the
coated PANI layer still exists, working as an admirable protective
skin. Meanwhile, it showed that the Mn 2p and Ni 2p bands are mainly
located at 653.4, 642.5, 641.1, and 858.8 eV (satellite peak), 854.2
eV, respectively, which is consistent with the previous literature.17

Therefore, it is believed that the conductive
PANI coating on the surface of the LNMO particles can not only act
as an electron-conductive layer, but can also be used as a primary
protective barrier to confront the decomposition of the electrolyte.
The possible schematic illustration of how the PANI layer works as
an effective protective layer to suppress the detrimental electrolyte
decomposition and reduce the dissolution of Mn is shown in Figure 12.33

Conclusions
An innovative
way to improve the electrochemical performance of LNMO by coating
the relatively homogeneous PANI layer has been successfully implemented.
It is proved that the LNMO–PANI composite material shows a
higher capacity retention and a better rate capability at room and
elevated temperatures than that of the bare LNMO. The promising electrochemical
performance of the LNMO–PANI composite material can be ascribed
to three reasons: (1) the polymer PANI, working as a conductive coating
agent, can enhance the conductivity of the bare LNMO; (2) the PANI
layer can also diminish the polarization resistance and interfacial
impedance by improving the severe interfacial reactions; (3) the external
PANI layer on the LNMO particles, using as a protective skin, can
relieve the serious decomposition of the electrolyte in the highly
oxidizing (>4.5 V) and elevated temperature environment, thus suppressing
the dissolution of transition metal ions into the electrolyte. This
work established a method to relieve ion dissolution in other similar
cathode materials. In consideration of the superior electrochemical
performance with the PANI coating, we believe that the LNMO–PANI
composite material is likely to be a high-energy and high-power cathode
material for the lithium-ion battery.

Experimental Section
Preparation of
the LNMO–PANI Composite Material
A certain amount
of the LNMO powder (WUJIE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD) was added
into distilled water and stirred for 1 h. Then 10 mL of 1 mol/L HCl
solution was prepared and added into the aqueous solution. When the
mixed solution was precooled in a 0 °C ice-water bath for 20
min, 5.1 wt % of aniline (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Limited Corporation,
SCRC) was slowly dripped into the solution and stirred for 20 min.
Afterwards, 11.5 mL of 1 mol/L ammonium peroxydisulfate was slowly
added into the above reacting aqueous solution with continuous stirring
for 20 h and the reaction temperature was always kept at 0 °C.
After that, the coated nanoparticles were washed repeatedly with a
large amount of distilled water and ethanol until the filtrate was
colorless by the suction filter. Finally, the wet LNMO–PANI
composite material was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12
h in Figure 13.

process with LNMO
and aniline by the in situ chemical oxidation polymerization method.

Physical Characterization
The
presence of PANI in the composite was confirmed by a Raman spectrometer
(LabRAM HR Evolution, HORIBA JOBIN YVON) with 632.8 nm laser excitation.
The PANI content in the composite was determined by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA, STA449F3, NETZSCH). The morphologies of the samples
were characterized by field emission-scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM, SU-8010, HITACHI) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS). To correctly measure the thickness of the PANI layer, Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL) was performed operating
at 200 kV. The crystal structure analyses of the as-prepared composite
electrode and the bare LNMO electrode were determined by X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE, BRUKER) with a Cu Kα radiation.

Electrochemical Measurements
The electrochemical performances of the materials were evaluated
via CR2032 coin cells. A mixture of 80 wt % active materials and 10
wt % conductive agent (Super P) with 10 wt % poly(vinylidene fluoride)
in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent was ground into
slurry, and then the slurry was pasted on Al foil. Subsequently, under
vacuum at 60 °C overnight, the CR2032 coin cells were assembled
in an Ar-filled glove-box using Li foil as the counter electrode,
the Whatman glass fiber film as the separator, and 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate and DMC (v/v = 1:1) as the electrolyte.
The cycling performance test was carried out between 3.0 and 4.95
V at both room (25 °C) and elevated temperatures (55 °C)
by the LAND test system (CT2001A, Wuhan, China). Rate capability was
also performed on the same instrument and under same conditions. The
cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment was accomplished using the electrochemical
workstation (CHI 760E, Shanghai, China) at a scan rate of 0.05 mV
s–1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
was conducted on the electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, Shanghai,
China) with a frequency range from 0.1 HZ to 100 kHz. Inductively
coupled plasma (ICP, ELAN DRC-e, PerkinElmer) was operated to observe
the dissolved amount of Ni and Mn from the spinel LNMO into the electrolyte.
