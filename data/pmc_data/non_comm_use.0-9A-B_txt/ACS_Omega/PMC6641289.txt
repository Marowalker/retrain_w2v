Environmentally friendly and renewable
hybrid lacquer coatings
with excellent aging resistant and anticorrosion properties were studied.
The coatings were prepared using raw lacquer coupled with the silane
agent 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane or N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane
via an eco-friendly sol–gel preparation process. The physical–mechanical
properties, thermal stability, aging resistance, and anticorrosion
properties of the as-prepared coatings were analyzed. Additionally,
the surface of the coatings before and after an accelerated aging
treatment was studied by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy. The results revealed that the hybrid lacquer coating
A (with a raw lacquer-to-APTES mass ratio of 1.8:1) resulted in films
with a significantly enhanced antiaging effect (e.g., six times higher
than that of lacquer at a gloss loss rate of 30%). Besides, this film
revealed an exceptional anticorrosion performance (with the lowest
corrosion current Icorr = 2.476 ×
10–10 A·cm–2) and a high
protection efficiency (99.99 and 94.10%), as demonstrated by its electrochemical
characteristics. Furthermore, all films exhibited a good barrier because
of their dense structure, which prevents the corrosive medium from
penetrating the coating during the salt spray test analysis after
1000 h. And the coating A relatively layered was distributing any
significant cancaves, integrity better than all coatings studied,
indicating that the based electrolyte was easier to penetrate it after
salt spraying 2000 h.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Corrosion can seriously
damage energy metal structures, which can
lead to potential losses of 1/5 of the total energy produced worldwide
and 4.2% of the gross national product on average.1 Thus, the development of effective corrosion inhibition
technologies represents a high economic value.2 Polymer organic coatings have various advantages over their metal
counterparts. Thus, polymer organic coatings are widely used in numerous
industrial applications owing to their low density, easy processing,
and superior anticorrosion and mechanical properties against moisture
and gases under rough environments.3−6 Several methods are available today for
preparing anticorrosive coatings including thermal spray coating,
chemical vapor deposition, plasma spraying, electroplating, laser
cladding, and sol–gel processes, among others.7,8 As is well-known, raw lacquer is a natural, biodegradable, renewable,
and environmentally friendly coating product which is people-friendly,
durable, and impermeable and exhibits chemical resistance to corrosive
medium.9,10 Because drying raw lacquer involves an enzyme-catalyzed
process, this step is slower than for common organic coatings.11 Moreover, enzymatic oxidation requires severe
and specific conditions (ca. 80–90% relative humidity at 20–30
°C) for the activation of laccase. Thus, there is a growing interest
in developing methods that allow rapid drying of raw lacquer under
natural environments. In this sense, urushiol–metal polymers
were prepared by the reaction between a metal ion and the phenyl hydroxyl
groups of urushiol.12−15 The resultant urushiol–metal polymers can be rapidly dried
at room temperature while showing enhanced anticorrosive properties
for industrial applications.16,17 Lacquer materials hybridized
with organic silanes have demonstrated rapid drying characteristics
under natural environments, and the hybridized coatings have been
studied by determining the mechanism of the hybridization reaction.18 Additionally, basic chemical sol–gel
processes have been used to prepare promising protective coatings,
allowing further design and control of their compositions and properties.19,20 Therefore, sol–gel processes can be a potential alternative
to prepare corrosion resistant coatings. Considering the specific
properties of hybridized lacquer coatings described in the literature,
sol–gel methods can be used to expand the scope of application
of these materials.

Herein, an eco-friendly sol–gel method
was used to conduct
the reaction between lacquer and a silane coupling agent. This reaction
resulted in fast-drying lacquer hybrid coatings at low cost and with
higher mechanical strength and better thermal stability characteristics.
Most importantly, the resultant lacquer hybrid coatings showed significantly
enhanced aging and corrosion resistance properties characterized by
accelerated aging, electrochemical analysis, and salt spray test analyses.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Measurement of the Physical–Mechanical
Properties
Raw lacquer is a natural product whose composition
and structure depend on the variety, origin, and condition of the
lacquer tree. We measured the drying times of various hybrid lacquer
coatings containing suitable organic silane ratios using a drying
time recorder, and the results are shown in Table 1.

b Drying times
were determined by
the drying time recorder. TF: touch-free dry, HD: hard dry.

As shown in Table 1, the cross-link onset times of the hybridized
lacquer coatings (entries
2–13) were shortened to less than half of the drying time of
L (entry 1). However, when an excess of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APTES) (entries 2–7) or N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane
(AATMS) (entries 8–13) was added, the cross-link onset time
was advanced remarkably. In these cases, the touch-free (TF) and hard-dry
(HD) drying times of the hybrid coatings containing high APTES (entries
6 and 7) and AATMS (entries 12 and 13) decreased. The drying time
of the hybridized lacquer was shortened via enzymatic oxidation and
autoxidation of the lacquer and the sol–gel reaction of silanes.
Moreover, alcoholysis between the urushiol hydroxyl groups and the
alkoxy group of the organic silanes took place, leading to oxidative
cross-linking polymerization. Thus, the autoxidation of the urushiol
unsaturated side chain to form a more complex polymer was confirmed,
which promoted fast drying of the lacquer material. Because the pencil
hardness and gloss properties of the coatings were excellent, all
of the films can be selected for various applications. The hybridized
lacquer coatings with the shortest drying times (entries 6, 7, 12,
and 13) were further studied.

Among the various measurements
concerning coatings, gel content
plays a vital role in the characterization of relative structures,
especially to those coatings that could not be soluble in any organic
solvents or water. The measured values corresponded to the different
samples (coatings A, B, C, D, and E) are summarized in Table 2. A gradual decrease in gel
content was observed with the increase in exposure time. The main
reason is that part of the conjugate and isolated double bond in urushiol
long carbon chain did not participate in the polymerization at room
temperature and could not completely form the interpenetrating network
structure. Obviously, the effect of coating E was the worst, whereas
that of A exhibited a better performance, which indicated that coating
A relatively completely reacted with a greater degree of gelation.

2.2 Characterization of the Synthesized Hybridized
Coatings
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements
were carried out to investigate and confirm the structures of the
hybrid lacquer films and lacquer coatings, and the spectra are shown
in Figure 1. The spectra
of APTES and AATMS are shown in Figure 1a. The obvious absorption peaks at 1050 and 690 cm–1 were associated with Si–O–C and RC=CRH
cis-structure extending vibrations, respectively. In Figure 1b, the spectra of the hybrid
lacquers (A, B, C, and D) showed the presence of a stretching vibration
peak at 3400 cm–1, which was ascribed to the phenolic
hydroxyl group (−OH), whereas absorption bands ascribed to
−CH2 and −CH groups were observed at 2925
and 2854 cm–1, respectively. The peak at 1710 cm–1 indicated that more urushiol quinones appeared. The
phenolic hydroxyl group in urushiol was replaced by a Si atom, thereby
reducing the strength of the absorption peak as compared to lacquer
(E). However, the absorption band assigned to −CH3 at 1460 cm–1 was relatively intense. New absorption
peaks at 1120 and 1050 cm–1 were associated with
Si–O–Si and Si–O–C extending vibrations,
respectively. Moreover, the intensity of the peaks at 1060 and 690
cm–1 (ascribed to trienes) and the peak of the RC=CRH
cis-structure increased, suggesting that laccase polymerization took
place.

2.3 Thermogravimetric Analysis
of Different Coatings
The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis
of the hybrid lacquer films
(A, B, C, and D) and lacquer (E) is shown in Figure 2 and Table 3. The lacquer films (A, B, C, D, and E) underwent two-stage
major weight-loss processes. The weight loss of the A, B, C, and D
films started at 319, 327, 305, and 304 °C, respectively, whereas
that of lacquer E started at 335 °C. This weight loss resulted
from the degradation of the uncompleted cross-linked urushiol oligomers
and other constituents such as glycoproteins and polysaccharides.
The maximum temperature of the weight loss associated with the decomposition
of the polymer for the hybrid films was 10 °C higher than that
of raw lacquer. This weight loss was produced by the decomposition
of the basic structural framework of Si–O–Si formed
by the reaction of lacquer and the silane coupling agent. These Si–O–Si
groups have superior chemical stability and heat resistance. In addition,
as a result of the electronegativity difference between Si and C atoms,
the Si–O bond is more polar than the C–O group. Thus,
the Si–O bonds can effectively shield the connected hydrocarbon
groups and improve the activation energy for the main chain fracture.21,22 It is not easy to break the resultant chemical bond between the
atoms, thereby improving the thermal stability of the hybrid lacquer
films (A, B, C, and D), which showed higher char yields as compared
to lacquer (E, 19.19%). In addition, the A films showed good thermal
properties.

2.4 Aging Resistance Analysis
of the Hybrid Lacquer
Coatings
After accelerated aging, all coatings were not obviously
damaged. On the basis of the surface gloss, films that underwent accelerated
aging treatments were analyzed. Gloss was used to illustrate the surface
of the film. The film surface gloss decreased with time and under
the impact of external conditions.23 In
the experiments, the films were placed in a xenon lamp aging box and
the gloss of the films was reduced for a long time. The gloss loss
rate was calculated using the following equation 1  where P0 and Pi are the gloss before and
after aging, respectively.

When exposed to the xenon lamp, the
films underwent further cross-linking to form a more dense and smooth
structure with the increasing ambient temperature. Therefore, before
exposure, the gloss of the coatings declined more slowly or even increased,
exhibiting lower and even negative gloss loss performance, such as
for coating C. The gloss loss of coatings increased because the coatings
may have holes or even cracks to form the rough surface in a relatively
higher temperature when continuely exposed under the xenon lamp. As
shown in Figure 3 and Table 4, the gloss loss rates
of the hybrid lacquer films (A, B, C, and D) were less than 40% when
exposed to UV irradiation for 192, 288, and 336 h (A and C showed
values below 21.67 and 9.79%, respectively). The loss rates of the
E film were 61.28 and 86.64% after 288 and 336 h, respectively, indicating
that the surface of the film may be significantly damaged or peeled
off. After exposure for 576 h, the loss rates of the A, B, C, and
D films reached 27.63, 39.49, 81.48, and 89.32%, respectively, with
the surfaces of the C and D films being seriously damaged. After irradiating
for 720 h, the loss rates of the A and B films were 80.86 and 86.65%,
respectively, and the films showed no aging resistance. Hence, the
data above demonstrated that the A film possessed good antiaging effects
(six times higher than those of the E film) at a gloss loss rate of
30%.

Higher film surface UV exposure
time and temperatures favored the
polymerization of lacquer with APTES or AATMS to form a denser structure
which provided the film with improved aging resistance. As a result,
the loss rate of the films was relatively low after 240 h of UV exposure.
In addition, the good chemical and heat resistance properties of those
Si–O–Si and Si–O–C groups resulted in
hybrid lacquer films (A, B, C, and D) with superior thermostability
as compared to lacquer (E). The phenol hydroxyl (−OH) groups
in lacquer favored ionization (oxidation) of H atoms and oxygen anion,
with the film surface becoming rough and the gloss significantly changing
as a result. Besides, upon increasing the illumination time, the Si–O–CH3 groups in the structure of the A, B, C, and D films readily
ionized −OCH3 radicals, destroying the molecular
branch structure and gradually decreasing antiaging as a result. As
shown in Figure 4,
the A and B films showed better aging resistances as compared to C
and D. These films were not densified because of the higher stereo-hindrance
effect of AATMS as compared to that of APTES.24,25 The A, B, C, D, and E films showed fracture surfaces before aging,
with a, b, c, d, and e images showing diverse morphologies after artificial
aging. As shown in Figure 4, before the aging treatment, the surface of the films was
relatively smooth and with no cracks, whereas cracks of varying degrees
were observed after the artificial aging treatment. The surface of
the B and D films also revealed the existence of holes. In addition,
the C, D, and E films showed deeper cracks than A and B, indicating
that the former were more significantly affected by the UV exposure
(a gloss rate of 80%). As a whole, the A film showed the best aging
resistance (six times higher than that of the E film with a gloss
loss rate of 30%) among the films tested herein.

films before and after antiaging analysis.

2.5 XPS Analysis of the Hybrid Lacquer Coatings
To sufficiently understand the chemical reaction taking place on
the coating surfaces during the aging process, the surface of hybrid
coatings was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The
C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, and Si 2p spectra of coatings A, C, and E before
and after the accelerated aging treatment are shown in Figure 5, and the results are summarized
in Tables 5–10. The C 1s spectra consisted of various
components, which were fitted into three Gaussian–Lorentzian
peaks corresponding to C–C or C=C (284 eV), C–O–C
(286 eV), and O–C=O (288 eV).26−29 The N1 and O1 bands were centered
at 400 and 532 eV, characteristic of C–N and Si–O–Si
species, respectively.30 The C 1s, O 1s,
and N 1s peaks of coating A before the accelerated aging treatment
were observed at 298, 543, and 413 eV, respectively (Figure 5). The C, O, and N elemental
contents of coating A before the accelerated aging treatment were
74.86, 19.60, and 0.42%, respectively (Table 5). After the accelerated aging treatments,
these values were 67.99, 23.26, and 2.43%, respectively (Table 6). The oxygen-to-carbon
(O/C) ratio increased from 0.262 to 0.342 after the aging treatment,
indicating that the UV radiation can promote molecular chain scission
and degrade the polymer. This loss of carbon may be ascribed to the
migration and volatility of the oxidation products obtained via degradation
of the carbonaceous compounds.

and after accelerated
aging.

As shown in Tables 7 and 8, the C and O elemental contents of
coating C before the accelerated aging treatment were 76.03 and 16.90%,
respectively, whereas these values changed to 51.14 and 30.96% after
the aging treatment, respectively. The O/C ratio of coating C increased
from 0.233 to 0.605 after the aging treatment. Compared to that of
coating C, the lower O/C ratio of coating A after aging revealed good
radiation damage resistance.

Tables 9 and 10 summarize
the XPS spectra and elemental content
data of coating E before and after accelerated aging treatment. The
C, O, and N elemental contents of coating E before the accelerated
aging treatment were 76.54, 15.17, and 3.89%, respectively, whereas
these values changed to 40.86, 39.79, and 1.98% after aging exposure,
respectively. The O/C ratio of coating C before the aging treatment
was 0.198, and this value increased to 0.974 after the aging process.

aging treatment were 0.342, 0.605, and 0.974%, respectively. Therefore,
coating A showed the best antiaging properties among the three coatings,
whereas coating E showed the poorest properties.

2.6 Corrosive Resistance Analysis of the Hybrid
Lacquer Coatings
The corrosion resistance ability of bare
steel coated with A, B, C, D, and E films was investigated by studying
the potentiodynamic polarization curves under a 3.5 wt % NaCl aqueous
solution, and the results are shown in Figure 6. The coatings showed a marked shift in both
the cathodic and anodic branches of the polarization curves toward
lower current densities.31 The corrosion-related
parameters were calculated on the basis of the Tafel potential curves,
and the results are shown in Table 11. The polarization resistance (Rp) values were calculated from Tafel plots, in eq 2.32−34 In addition, the corrosion
rate (CR) and protection efficiency (PE) were calculated following eqs 3 and 4. 2  where ba and bc are the anodic and cathodic slopes,
respectively.35 3  where M is the molecular
weight, V is the valence, and D is
the density.36 4  where Icorr,bare and Icorr,coated stand for the corrosion
current density for bare steel and coating, respectively.

All hybrid films (A, B, C, and D) showed significantly reduced
corrosion currents (Icorr) and increased
potentials (Ecorr), indicative of a superior
corrosion protection. Compared to bare metal or lacquer (E), all of the hybrid films (A, B, C, and D) showed enhanced Rp and lower CR, both indicative of superior
corrosion protection. Higher PE is indicative of good and efficient
coating protection.37−39

Therefore, by comparing these values, the hybrid
lacquer coatings
apparently demonstrated efficient corrosion resistant properties under
harsh chemical conditions, preventing oxidation and corrosion. Nevertheless,
the A film showed superior protective properties versus the B, C,
and D films under similar conditions. Thus, the A film showed superior
PE and the lowest Icorr (2.476 ×
10–10 A/cm2) and the highest PE (99.99
and 94.10%) values among the studied coatings, suggesting that a dense
film was formed. Generally, a dense protective coating prevents the
corrosive medium from penetrating the film, avoiding electrochemical
reactions at the coating/substrate interface. Therefore, the electrochemical
results obtained revealed that the A film possessed superior corrosion
resistance under a 3.5 wt % NaCl solution, indicating that the cross-linking
density film possesses a good shielding effect that prevented the
corrosion medium from reaching the metal surface.

The samples
were studied by different coatings on the mild steel
substrate surface. The visual microcosmic observation of the coatings
is shown in Figure 7 after a 1000 h exposure in a 5.0 wt % NaCl solution in the salt
spray test. In addition, this test can be used as an indication of
barrier properties in the hybrid matrix. Macroscopic results of anticorrosion
coatings before and after the 2000 h salt spray test are shown in Figure 7 and Table 12. They did not obviously change
before and after the spray test, in that the coatings show no color
change, bubbles, cracks, and rust, as well as no obscission in macroscopic
observation. All coatings show no obvious damage on the whole after
exposure, as shown in Figure 8, and the corrosion manifest as wide relatively shallow areas,
with no deep pitting of localized corrosion.40 The dense surface of samples A and B was microscopic, integrity
better than C, D, and E films. The films were showing the corrosion
products, and distribution of numerous pores and pits, bad overall,
especially E film. That is the presence of pores and pits based electrolyte
is easier to penetrate the corrosive medium of the coatings, accelerating
corrosion. In contrast to the entire process, the coating microstructure
E determines more rapid corrosion than A, B, C, and D coatings because
it loses its electrochemical protection in a relatively weak somewhere,
such as pores and pits. Sectional surface of sample E became larger
than those of other films after 1000 h of corrosion immersion period.
This is attributed to the inner corrosion and/or corrosion product
wedging, a process that might be similar to the exfoliation corrosion
of metal steel. After spraying for 2000 h, the coatings fell off with
different degrees of damage. coatings D and E formed holes which seemed
a bit deep. Particularly, the damaged area of coating E was relatively
large during complete exposure to the salt spray environment. After
the shielding effect of protective coatings during increasing exposure
time, the metal steel matrix is completely exposed to the corrosive
environment.41 Thus, the apparent resistance
to the corrosion of coating A exhibited excellent barrier to the corrosive
atmosphere.

3 Conclusions
In this work, renewable hybrid lacquer coatings
were prepared.
These coatings showed good aging resistance and anticorrosion properties.
These coatings were prepared by an eco-friendly process, and no volatile
organic compounds were employed, reducing the material costs. The
hybrid lacquer coatings with a raw lacquer-to-APTES mass ratio of
1.8:1 showed significantly enhanced antiaging characteristics (six
times than that of regular lacquer with a gloss loss rate of 30%).
This coating showed the lowest Icorr value
(2.476 × 10–10 A/cm2) and highest
PE (99.99 and 94.10%), and no obvious damage was observed in the salt
spray test when compared to all films studied, significantly protecting
the metal from the corrosive medium and avoiding penetration issues
through surface cracks or pores and pits after 2000 h. Therefore,
the hybrid lacquer coatings represent an environmentally friendly
coating technology with promising applications in the aging resistance
and corrosion protection industries.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Raw lacquer (L) was collected
from the Hubei Province. APTES and AATMS were purchased from Aladdin
Industrial Corporation. A cardanol phenolic resin diluent was purchased
from the Biological Materials Technology Co. Ltd (Jiangsu, China).
Crystalline NaCl (99.2%) was used to prepare a 3.5 wt % NaCl aqueous
solution. All chemicals were used as received.

4.2 Preparation
of the Hybridized Corrosion Coatings
Raw lacquer (25 g) was
stirred in an open glass container at 25–40
°C for 2–4 h until the water concentration decreased to
3–5%.21 The hybrid coatings were
subsequently prepared by adding APTES or AATMS to the raw lacquer
at different raw lacquer-to-APTES or raw lacquer-to-AATMS mass ratios
(i.e., 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1.8:1, 3:2, and 1.3:1). A 20 wt % cardanol phenolic
resin diluent was subsequently added to the above mixture. After stirring
at room temperature for 0.5 h, the mixture was coated on the surface
of dry tinplate and copper pieces previously treated with sandpaper
and cleaned with ethanol. The specimens were dried at room temperature.
A silane coupling agent-free lacquer coating (denoted as L) was prepared
under similar conditions for comparison. In addition, the hybrid coatings
of lacquer to APTES or AATMS in different mass ratios (1.8:1 and 1:3:1)
formed the films, including L/APTES = 1.8:1, L/APTES = 1.3:1, L/AATMS
= 1.8:1, and L/AATMS = 1.3:1, which are designated as coatings A,
B, C, and D, respectively.

4.3 Characterization Experiments
Drying
properties of hybrid lacquer coatings were evaluated by a drying time
recorder (TaiYu Equipment Co. Ltd., Japan), according to the Chinese
standards GB/T1728-1979 and GB/T6739-2006. The gel content method
was performed using the following procedure. Gel content is expressed
as  where m0 is the
initial weight of the film and mt is the
final weight after extraction with xylene.

FT-IR spectroscopy
measurements (KBr) were conducted on an American Nicolet 5700 FT-IR
spectrometer. TG and derivative TG analyses were carried out on a
DSC822e-type TG analyzer (Mettler-Toledo) at a rate of 10 °C/min
within a temperature range of 30–600 °C under a nitrogen
atmosphere. Following the Chinese standard GB/T 1865-1997, the aging
resistance of all films was tested on an LXD-080 xenon lamp aging
box (Shanghai Huitai Instrument Manufacturing Co. Ltd), with wavelengths
ranging from 290 to 800 nm and with an irradiance of 0.51 W/m2. The spraying rainfall cycle lasted 24 min and was repeated
in intervals of 120 min, with a distance between the sample and the
lamp of 30 cm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained
on a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7500) under
vacuum with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. XPS analysis was performed
on a Thermo VG ESCALAB250Xi spectrometer at a residual pressure of
10–9 mbar. An Al Kα monochromatized radiation
(photon energy = 1486.6 eV) was employed as the X-ray source. The
corrosion resistance of the coatings was investigated via electrochemical
measurements on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation with a 3.5 wt
% NaCl standard aqueous solution and with a platinum auxiliary electrode
and saturated calomel as reference electrodes. Anticorrosion measurements
were performed in a salt-spray testing chamber (FQY015 Cyclic Corrosion
Tester) with a 5.0 wt % aqueous NaCl, according to the Chinese standard
GB/T 1771-91.
